In\r\npresenting his Bill of Rights, in stepping forward as the champion of\r\nindividual liberty, he seems to be possessed by a new spirit. He speaks\r\nlike a martyr, or the defender of martyrs. The individual human soul, with\r\nits unfathomable endowments, and its capacity of growing to something\r\nundreamt of in our philosophy, becomes in his eyes a sacred thing, and\r\nevery encroachment on its world-wide domain is treated as sacrilege.\r\nSociety, the arch-enemy of the rights of individuality, is represented\r\nlike an evil spirit, whom it behooves every true man to resist with might\r\nand main, and whose demands, as they cannot be altogether ignored, must be\r\nreduced at all hazards to the lowest level.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether any of the principles for which Mill pleaded so warmly and\r\nstrenuously in his Essay “On Liberty” would at the present day be\r\nchallenged or resisted, even by the most illiberal of philosophers, or the\r\nmost conservative of politicians. Mill’s demands sound very humble to\r\n_our_ ears. They amount to no more than this, “that the individual is not\r\naccountable to society for his actions so far as they concern the\r\ninterests of no person but himself, and that he may be subjected to social\r\nor legal punishments for such actions only as are prejudicial to the\r\ninterests of others.”\r\n\r\nIs there any one here present who doubts the justice of that principle, or\r\nwho would wish to reduce the freedom of the individual to a smaller\r\nmeasure? Whatever social tyranny may have existed twenty years ago, when\r\nit wrung that fiery protest from the lips of John Stuart Mill, can we\r\nimagine a state of society, not totally Utopian, in which the individual\r\nman need be less ashamed of his social fetters, in which he could more\r\nfreely utter all his honest convictions, more boldly propound all his\r\ntheories, more fearlessly agitate for their speedy realization; in which,\r\nin fact, each man can be so entirely himself as the society of England,\r\nsuch as it now is, such as generations of hard-thinking and hard-working\r\nEnglishmen have made it, and left it as the most sacred inheritance to\r\ntheir sons and daughters?\r\n\r\nLook through the whole of history, not excepting the brightest days of\r\nrepublican freedom at Athens and Rome, and you will not find one single\r\nperiod in which the measure of liberty accorded to each individual was\r\nlarger than it is at present, at least in England. And if you wish to\r\nrealize the full blessings of the time in which we live, compare Mill’s\r\nplea for Liberty with another written not much more than two hundred years\r\nago, and by a thinker not inferior either in power or boldness to Mill\r\nhimself. According to Hobbes, the only freedom which an individual in his\r\nideal state has a right to claim is what he calls “freedom of thought,”\r\nand that freedom of thought consists in our being able to think what we\r\nlike—so long as we keep it to ourselves. Surely, such freedom of thought\r\nexisted even in the days of the Inquisition, and we should never call\r\nthought free, if it had to be kept a prisoner in solitary and silent\r\nconfinement. By freedom of thought we mean freedom of speech, freedom of\r\nthe press, freedom of action, whether individual or associated, and of\r\nthat freedom the present generation, as compared with all former\r\ngenerations, the English nation, as compared with all other nations,\r\nenjoys, there can be no doubt, a good measure, pressed down, and shaken\r\ntogether, and sometimes running over.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that some dogmas still remain in politics, in religion, and\r\nin morality; but those who defend them claim no longer any infallibility,\r\nand those who attack them, however small their minority, need fear no\r\nviolence, nay, may reckon on an impartial and even sympathetic hearing, as\r\nsoon as people discover in their pleadings the true ring of honest\r\nconviction and the warmth inspired by an unselfish love of truth.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed strange, therefore, to many readers of Mill, particularly on\r\nthe Continent, that this plea for liberty, this demand for freedom for\r\nevery individual to be what he is, and to develop all the germs of his\r\nnature, should have come from what is known as the freest of all\r\ncountries, England. We might well understand such a cry of indignation if\r\nit had reached us from Russia; but why should English philosophers, of all\r\nothers, have to protest against the tyranny of society? It is true,\r\nnevertheless, that in countries governed despotically, the individual,\r\nunless he is obnoxious to the Government, enjoys far greater freedom, or\r\nrather license, than in a country like England, which governs itself.\r\nRussian society, for instance, is extremely indulgent. It tolerates in its\r\nrulers and statesmen a haughty defiance of the simplest rules of social\r\npropriety, and it seems amused rather than astonished or indignant at the\r\nvagaries, the frenzies, and outrages of those who in brilliant\r\ndrawing-rooms or lecture-rooms preach the doctrines of what is called\r\nNihilism or Individualism,(2)—viz., “that society must be regenerated by a\r\nstruggle for existence and the survival of the strongest, processes which\r\nNature has sanctioned, and which have proved successful among wild\r\nanimals.” If there is danger in these doctrines the Government is expected\r\nto see to it. It may place watchmen at the doors of every house and at the\r\ncorner of every street, but it must not count on the better classes coming\r\nforward to enrol themselves as special constables, or even on the\r\ncoöperation of public opinion which in England would annihilate that kind\r\nof Nihilism with one glance of scorn and pity.\r\n\r\nIn a self-governed country like England, the resistance which society, if\r\nit likes, can oppose to the individual in the assertion of his rights, is\r\nfar more compact and powerful than in Russia, or even in Germany. Even\r\nwhere it does not employ the arm of the law, society knows how to use that\r\nquieter, but more crushing pressure, that calm, Gorgon-like look which\r\nonly the bravest and stoutest hearts know how to resist.\r\n\r\nIt is against that indirect repression which a well-organized society\r\nexercises, both through its male and female representatives, that Mill’s\r\ndemand for liberty seems directed. He does not stand up for unlimited\r\nindividualism; on the contrary, he would have been the most strenuous\r\ndefender of that balance of power between the weak and the strong on which\r\nall social life depends. But he resents those smaller penalties which\r\nsociety will always inflict on those who disturb its dignified peace and\r\ncomfort:—avoidance, exclusion, a cold look, a stinging remark. Had Mill\r\nany right to complain of these social penalties? Would it not rather\r\namount to an interference with individual liberty to deprive any\r\nindividual or any number of individuals of those weapons of self-defence?\r\nThose who themselves think and speak freely, have hardly a right to\r\ncomplain, if others claim the same privilege. Mill himself called the\r\nConservative party the stupid party _par excellence_, and he took great\r\npains to explain that it was so not by accident, but by necessity. Need he\r\nwonder if those whom he whipped and scourged used their own whips and\r\nscourges against so merciless a critic?\r\n\r\nFreethinkers—and I use that name as a title of honor for all who, like\r\nMill, claim for every individual the fullest freedom in thought, word, or\r\ndeed, compatible with the freedom of others—are apt to make one mistake.\r\nConscious of their own honest intentions, they cannot bear to be misjudged\r\nor slighted. They expect society to submit to their often very painful\r\noperations as a patient submits to the knife of the surgeon. This is not\r\nin human nature. The enemy of abuses is always abused by his enemies.\r\nSociety will never yield one inch without resistance, and few reformers\r\nlive long enough to receive the thanks of those whom they have reformed.\r\nMill’s unsolicited election to Parliament was a triumph not often shared\r\nby social reformers; it was as exceptional as Bright’s admission to a seat\r\nin the Cabinet, or Stanley’s appointment as Dean of Westminster. Such\r\nanomalies will happen in a country fortunately so full of anomalies as\r\nEngland; but, as a rule, a political reformer must not be angry if he\r\npasses through life without the title of Right Honorable; nor should a\r\nman, if he will always speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth, be disappointed if he dies a martyr rather than a Bishop.\r\n\r\nBut even granting that in Mill’s time there existed some traces of social\r\ntyranny, where are they now? Look at the newspapers and the journals. Is\r\nthere any theory too wild, any reform too violent, to be openly defended?\r\nLook at the drawing-rooms or the meetings of learned societies. Are not\r\nthe most eccentric talkers the spoiled children of the fashionable world?\r\nWhen young lords begin to discuss the propriety of limiting the rights of\r\ninheritance, and young tutors are not afraid to propose curtailing the\r\nlong vacation, surely we need not complain of the intolerance of English\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nWhenever I state these facts to my German and French and Italian friends,\r\nwho from reading Mill’s Essay “On Liberty” have derived the impression\r\nthat, however large an amount of political liberty England may enjoy, it\r\nenjoys but little of intellectual freedom, they are generally willing to\r\nbe converted so far as London, or other great cities are concerned. But\r\nlook at your Universities, they say, the nurseries of English thought!\r\nCompare their mediæval spirit, their monastic institutions, their\r\nscholastic philosophy, with the freshness and freedom of the Continental\r\nUniversities! Strong as these prejudices about Oxford and Cambridge have\r\nlong been, they have become still more intense since Professor Helmholtz,\r\nin an inaugural address which he delivered at his installation as Rector\r\nof the University of Berlin, lent to them the authority of his great name.\r\n“The tutors,” he says,(3) “in the English Universities cannot deviate by a\r\nhair’s-breadth from the dogmatic system of the English Church, without\r\nexposing themselves to the censure of their Archbishops and losing their\r\npupils.” In German Universities, on the contrary, we are told that the\r\nextreme conclusions of materialistic metaphysics, the boldest speculations\r\nwithin the sphere of Darwin’s theory of evolution, may be propounded\r\nwithout let or hindrance, quite as much as the highest apotheosis of Papal\r\ninfallibility.\r\n\r\nHere the facts on which Professor Helmholtz relies are entirely wrong, and\r\nthe writings of some of our most eminent tutors supply a more than\r\nsufficient refutation of his statements. Archbishops have no official\r\nposition whatsoever in English Universities, and their censure of an\r\nOxford tutor would be resented as impertinent by the whole University. Nor\r\ndoes the University, as such, exercise any very strict control over the\r\ntutors, even when they lecture not to their own College only. Each Master\r\nof Arts at Oxford claims now the right to lecture (_venia docendi_), and I\r\ndoubt whether they would submit to those restrictions which, in Germany,\r\nthe Faculty imposes on every _Privat-docent_. _Privat-docents_ in German\r\nUniversities have been rejected by the Faculty for incompetence, and\r\nsilenced for insubordination. I know of no such cases at Oxford during my\r\nresidence of more than thirty years, nor can I think it likely that they\r\nshould ever occur.\r\n\r\nAs to the extreme conclusions of materialistic metaphysics, there are\r\nOxford tutors who have grappled with the systems of such giants as Hobbes,\r\nLocke, or Hume, and who are not likely to be frightened by Büchner and\r\nVogt.\r\n\r\nI know comparisons are odious, and I should be the last man to draw\r\ncomparisons between English and German Universities unfavorable to the\r\nlatter. But with regard to freedom of thought, of speech, and action,\r\nProfessor Helmholtz, if he would spend but a few weeks at Oxford, would\r\nfind that we enjoy it in fuller measure here than the Professors and\r\n_Privat-docents_ in any Continental University. The publications of some\r\nof our professors and tutors ought at least to have convinced him that if\r\nthere is less of brave words and turbulent talk in their writings, they\r\ndisplay throughout a determination to speak the truth, which may be\r\nmatched, but could not easily be excelled, by the leaders of thought in\r\nFrance, Germany, or Italy.\r\n\r\nThe real difference between English and Continental Universities is that\r\nthe former govern themselves, the latter are governed. Self-government\r\nentails responsibilities, sometimes restraints and reticences. I may here\r\nbe allowed to quote the words of another eminent Professor of the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, Du Bois Reymond, who, in addressing his colleagues,\r\nventured to tell them,(4) “We have still to learn from the English how the\r\ngreatest independence of the individual is compatible with willing\r\nsubmission to salutary, though irksome, statutes.” That is particularly\r\ntrue when the statutes are self-imposed. In Germany, as Professor\r\nHelmholtz tells us himself, the last decision in almost all the more\r\nimportant affairs of the Universities rests with the Government, and he\r\ndoes not deny that in times of political and ecclesiastical tension, a\r\nmost ill-advised use has been made of that power. There are, besides, the\r\nless important matters, such as raising of salaries, leave of absence,\r\nscientific missions, even titles and decorations, all of which enable a\r\nclever Minister of Instruction to assert his personal influence among the\r\nless independent members of the University. In Oxford the University does\r\nnot know the Ministry, nor the Ministry the University. The acts of the\r\nGovernment, be it Liberal or Conservative, are freely discussed, and often\r\npowerfully resisted by the academic constituencies, and the personal\r\ndislike of a Minister or Ministerial Councillor could as little injure a\r\nprofessor or tutor as his favor could add one penny to his salary.\r\n\r\nBut these are minor matters. What gives their own peculiar character to\r\nthe English Universities is a sense of power and responsibility: power,\r\nbecause they are the most respected among the numerous corporations in the\r\ncountry; responsibility, because the higher education of the whole country\r\nhas been committed to their charge. Their only master is public opinion as\r\nrepresented in Parliament, their only incentive their own sense of duty.\r\nThere is no country in Europe where Universities hold so exalted a\r\nposition, and where those who have the honour to belong to them may say\r\nwith greater truth _Noblesse oblige_.\r\n\r\nI know the dangers of self-government, particularly where higher and more\r\nideal interests are concerned, and there are probably few who wish for a\r\nreal reform in schools and Universities who have not occasionally yielded\r\nto the desire for a Dictator, of a Bismarck or a Falk. But such a desire\r\nsprings only from a momentary weakness and despondency; and no one who\r\nknows the difference between being governed and governing one’s self,\r\nwould ever wish to descend from that higher though dangerous position to a\r\nlower one, however safe and comfortable it might seem. No one who has\r\ntasted the old wine of freedom would ever really wish to exchange it for\r\nthe new wine of external rule. Public opinion is sometimes a hard master,\r\nand majorities can be great tyrants to those who want to be honest to\r\ntheir own convictions. But in the struggle of all against all, each\r\nindividual feels that he has his rightful place, and that he may exercise\r\nhis rightful influence. If he is beaten, he is beaten in fair fight; if he\r\nconquers, he has no one else to thank. No doubt, despotic Governments have\r\noften exercised the most beneficial patronage in encouraging and rewarding\r\npoets, artists, and men of science. But men of genius who have conquered\r\nthe love and admiration of a whole nation are greater than those who have\r\ngained the favor of the most brilliant Courts; and we know how some of the\r\nfairest reputations have been wrecked on the patronage which they had to\r\naccept at the hands of powerful Ministers or ambitious Sovereigns.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mill and his plea for Liberty. Though I can hardly\r\nbelieve that, were he still among us, he would claim a larger measure of\r\nfreedom for the individual than is now accorded to every one of us in the\r\nsociety in which we move, yet the chief cause on which he founded his plea\r\nfor Liberty, the chief evil which he thought could be remedied only if\r\nsociety would allow more elbow-room to individual genius, exists in the\r\nsame degree as in his time—aye, even in a higher degree. The principle of\r\nindividuality has suffered more at present than perhaps at any former\r\nperiod of history. The world is becoming more and more gregarious, and\r\nwhat the French call our _nature moutonnière_, our tendency to leap where\r\nthe sheep in front of us has leapt, becomes more and more prevalent in\r\npolitics, in religion, in art, and even in science. M. de Tocqueville\r\nexpressed his surprise how much more Frenchmen of the present day resemble\r\none another than did those of the last generation. The same remark, adds\r\nJohn Stuart Mill, might be made of England in a greater degree. “The\r\nmodern _régime_ of public opinion,” he writes, “is in an unorganized form\r\nwhat the Chinese educational and political systems are in an organized;\r\nand unless individuality shall be able successfully to assert itself\r\nagainst this yoke, Europe, notwithstanding its noble antecedents and its\r\nprofessed Christianity, will tend to become another China.”\r\n\r\nI fully agree with Mill in recognizing the dangers of uniformity, but I\r\ndoubt whether what he calls the _régime_ of public opinion is alone, or\r\neven chiefly, answerable for it. No doubt there are some people in whose\r\neyes uniformity seems an advantage rather than a disadvantage. If all were\r\nequally strong, equally educated, equally honest, equally rich, equally\r\ntall, or equally small, society would seem to them to have reached the\r\nhighest ideal. The same people admire an old French garden, with its\r\nclipped yew-trees, forming artificial walls and towers and pyramids, far\r\nmore than the giant yews which, like large serpents, clasp the soil with\r\ntheir coiling roofs, and overshadow with their dark green branches the\r\nwhite chalk cliffs of the Thames. But those French gardens, unless they\r\nare constantly clipped and prevented from growing, soon fall into decay.\r\nAs in nature, so in society, uniformity means but too often stagnation,\r\nwhile variety is the surest sign of health and vigor. The deepest secret\r\nof nature is its love of continued novelty. Its tendency, if unrestrained,\r\nis towards constantly creating new varieties, which, if they fulfil their\r\npurpose, become fixed for a time, or, it may be, forever; while others,\r\nafter they have fulfilled their purpose, vanish to make room for new and\r\nstronger types.\r\n\r\nThe same is the secret of human society. It consists and lives in\r\nindividuals, each meant to be different from all the others, and to\r\ncontribute his own peculiar share to the common wealth. As no tree is like\r\nany other tree, and no leaf on the same tree like any other leaf, no human\r\nbeing is, or is meant to be, exactly like any other human being. It is in\r\nthis endless, and to us inconceivable, variety of human souls that the\r\ndeepest purpose of human life is to be realized; and the more society\r\nfulfils that purpose, the more its allows free scope for the development\r\nof every individual germ, the richer will be the harvest in no distant\r\nfuture. Such is the mystery of individuality that I do not wonder if even\r\nthose philosophers who, like Mill, confine the use of the word _sacred_\r\nwithin the very smallest compass, see in each individual soul something\r\nsacred, something to be revered, even where we cannot understand it,\r\nsomething to be protected against all vulgar violence.\r\n\r\nWhere I differ from Mill and his school is on the question as to the\r\nquarter from whence the epidemic of uniformity springs which threatens the\r\nfree development of modern society. Mill points to the society in which we\r\nmove; to those who are in front of us, to our contemporaries. I feel\r\nconvinced that our real enemies are at our back, and that the heaviest\r\nchains which are fastened on us are those made, not by the present, but by\r\npast generations—by our ancestors, not by our contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIt is on this point, on the trammels of individual freedom with which we\r\nmay almost be said to be born into the world, and on the means by which we\r\nmay shake off these old chains, or at all events learn to carry them more\r\nlightly and gracefully, that I wish to speak to you this evening.\r\n\r\nYou need not be afraid that I am going to enter upon the much discussed\r\nsubject of heredity, whether in its physiological or psychological\r\naspects. It is a favorite subject just now, and the most curious facts\r\nhave been brought together of late to illustrate the working of what is\r\ncalled heredity. But the more we know of these facts, the less we seem\r\nable to comprehend the underlying principle. Inheritance is one of those\r\nnumerous words which by their very simplicity and clearness are so apt to\r\ndarken our counsel. If a father has blue eyes and the son has blue eyes,\r\nwhat can be clearer than that he inherited them? If the father stammers\r\nand the son stammers, who can doubt but that it came by inheritance? If\r\nthe father is a musician and the son a musician, we say very glibly that\r\nthe talent was inherited. But what does _inherited_ mean? In no case does\r\nit mean what _inherited_ usually means—something external, like money,\r\ncollected by a father, and, after his death, secured by law to his son.\r\nWhatever else inherited may mean, it does not mean that. But unfortunately\r\nthe word is there, it seems almost pedantic to challenge its meaning, and\r\npeople are always grateful if an easy word saves them the trouble of hard\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAnother apparent advantage of the theory of heredity is that it never\r\nfails. If the son has blue, and the father black, eyes, all is right\r\nagain, for either the mother, or the grandmother, or some historic or\r\nprehistoric ancestor, may have had blue eyes, and atavism, we know, will\r\nassert itself after hundreds and thousands of years.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose that I deny the broad facts of what is called by the name\r\nof heredity. What I deny is that the name of heredity offers any\r\nscientific solution of a most difficult problem. It is a name, a metaphor,\r\nquite as bad as the old metaphor of _innate ideas_; for there is hardly a\r\nsingle point of similarity between the process by which a son may share\r\nthe black eyes, the stammering, or the musical talent of his father, and\r\nthat by which, after his father’s death, the law secures to the son the\r\npossession of the pounds, shillings, and pence which his father held in\r\nthe Funds.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the true meaning of heredity may be, certain it is that every\r\nindividual comes into the world heavy-laden. Nowhere has the consciousness\r\nof the burden which rests on each generation as it enters on its journey\r\nthrough life found stronger expression than among the Buddhists. What\r\nother people call by various names, “fate or providence,” “tradition or\r\ninheritance,” “circumstances or environment,” they call _Karman_,\r\ndeed—what has been done, whether by ourselves or by others, the\r\naccumulated work of all who have come before us, the consequences of which\r\nwe have to bear, both for good and for evil. Originally this _Karman_\r\nseems to have been conceived as personal, as the work which we ourselves\r\nhave done in our former existences. But, as personally we are not\r\nconscious of having done such work in former ages, that kind of _Karman_,\r\ntoo, might be said to be impersonal. To the question how _Karman_ began,\r\nwhat was the nucleus of that accumulation which forms the condition of\r\npresent existence, Buddhism has no answer to give, any more than any other\r\nsystem of religion or philosophy. The Buddhists say it began with\r\n_avidyâ_, and _avidyâ_ means ignorance.(5) They are much more deeply\r\ninterested in the question how _Karman_ may be annihilated, how each man\r\nmay free himself from the influence of _Karman_, and Nirvâ_n_a, the\r\nhighest object of all their dreams, is often defined by Buddhist\r\nphilosophers as “freedom from _Karman_.”(6)\r\n\r\nWhat the Buddhists call by the general name of _Karman_, comprehends all\r\ninfluences which the past exercises on the present, whether physical or\r\nmental.(7) It is not my object to examine or even to name all these\r\ninfluences, though I confess nothing is more interesting than to look upon\r\nthe surface of our modern life as we look on a geological map, and to see\r\nthe most ancient formations cropping out everywhere under our feet.\r\nDifficult as it is to color a geological map of England, it would be still\r\nmore difficult to find a sufficient variety of colors to mark the\r\ndifferent ingredients of the intellectual condition of her people.\r\n\r\nThat all of us, whether we speak English or German, or French or Russian,\r\nare really speaking an ancient Oriental tongue, incredible as it would\r\nhave sounded a hundred years ago, is now recognized by everybody. Though\r\nthe various dialects now spoken in Europe have been separated many\r\nthousands of years from the Sanskrit, the ancient classical language of\r\nIndia, yet so close is the bond that holds the West and East together,\r\nthat in many cases an intelligent Englishman might still guess the meaning\r\nof a Sanskrit word. How little difference is there between Sanskrit _sûnu_\r\nand English _son_, between Sanskrit _duhitar_ and English _daughter_,\r\nbetween Sanskrit _vid_, to know, and English to _wit_, between Sanskrit\r\n_vaksh_, to grow, and English to _wax!_ Think how we value a Saxon urn, or\r\na Roman coin, or a Keltic weapon! how we dig for them, clean them, label\r\nthem, and carefully deposit them in our museums! Yet what is their\r\nantiquity compared with the antiquity of such words as _son_ or\r\n_daughter_, _father_ and _mother_? There are no monuments older than those\r\ncollected in the handy volumes which we call Dictionaries, and those who\r\nknow how to interpret those English antiquities—as you may see them\r\ninterpreted, for instance, in Grimm’s Dictionary of the German, in\r\nLittré’s Dictionary of the French, or in Professor Skeats’ Etymological\r\nDictionary of the English Language—will learn more of the real growth of\r\nthe human mind than by studying many volumes on logic and psychology.\r\n\r\nAnd as by our language we belong to the Aryan stratum, we belong through\r\nour letters to the Hamitic. We still write English in hieroglyphics; and\r\nin spite of all the vicissitudes through which the ancient hieroglyphics\r\nhave passed in their journey from Egypt to Phœnicia, from Phœnicia to\r\nGreece, from Greece to Italy, and from Italy to England, when we write a\r\ncapital F [Cursive F], when we draw the top line and the smaller line\r\nthrough the middle of the letter, we really draw the two horns of the\r\ncerastes, the horned serpent, which the ancient Egyptians used for\r\nrepresenting the sound of f. They write the name of the king whom the\r\nGreeks called _Cheops_, and they themselves _Chu-fu_, like this:(8)—\r\n\r\n                         [Three Egyptian signs.]\r\n\r\nHere the first sign, the sieve, is to be pronounced _chu_; the second, the\r\nhorned serpent, _fu_, and the little bird, again, _u_. In the more cursive\r\nor Hieratic writing the horned serpent appears as [Egyptian character]; in\r\nthe later Demotic as [Egyptian character] and [Egyptian character]. The\r\nPhœnicians, who borrowed their letters from the Hieratic Egyptian, wrote\r\n[Phoenician character] and [Phoenician character]. The Greeks, who took\r\ntheir letters from the Phœnicians, wrote [Greek character]. When the\r\nGreeks, instead of writing, like the Phœnicians, from right to left, began\r\nto write from left to right, they turned each letter, and as [Phoenician\r\ncharacter] became [Greek character], our k, so [Phoenician character],\r\nvau, became F, the Greek so-called Digamma, [Greek character], the Latin\r\nF.\r\n\r\nThe first letter in _Chu-fu_, too, still exists in our alphabet, and in\r\nthe transverse line of our H we may recognize the last remnant of the\r\nlines which divide the sieve. The sieve appears in Hieratic as [Egyptian\r\ncharacter], in Phœnician as [Phoenician character], in ancient Greek as\r\n[Greek character], which occurs on an inscription found at Mycenæ and\r\nelsewhere as the sign of the spiritus asper, while in Latin it is known to\r\nus as the letter H.(9) In the same manner the undulating line of our\r\ncapital L [Cursive L] still recalls very strikingly the bent back of the\r\ncrouching lion, [Egyptian character], which in the later hieroglyphic\r\ninscriptions represents the sound of L.\r\n\r\nIf thus in our language we are Aryan, in our letters Egyptian, we have\r\nonly to look at our watches to see that we are Babylonian. Why is our hour\r\ndivided into sixty minutes, our minute into sixty seconds? Would not a\r\ndivision of the hour into ten, or fifty, or a hundred minutes have been\r\nmore natural? We have sixty divisions on the dials of our watches simply\r\nbecause the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who lived in the second century\r\nB. C., accepted the Babylonian system of reckoning time, that system being\r\nsexagesimal. The Babylonians knew the decimal system, but for practical\r\npurposes they counted by _sossi_ and _sari_, the _sossos_ representing 60,\r\nthe _saros_ 60 × 60, or 3,600. From Hipparchus that system found its way\r\ninto the works of Ptolemy, about 150 A. D., and thence it was carried down\r\nthe stream of civilization, finding its last resting-place on the\r\ndial-plates of our clocks.\r\n\r\nAnd why are there twenty shillings to our sovereign? Again the real reason\r\nlies in Babylon. The Greeks learnt from the Babylonians the art of\r\ndividing gold and silver for the purpose of trade. It has been proved that\r\nthe current gold piece of Western Asia was exactly the sixtieth part of a\r\nBabylonian _mnâ_, or _mina_. It was nearly equal to our sovereign. The\r\ndifficult problem of the relative value of gold and silver in a\r\nbi-metallic currency had been solved to a certain extent in the ancient\r\nMesopotamian kingdom, the proportion between gold and silver being fixed\r\nat 1 to 13-1/3. The silver shekel current in Babylon was heavier than the\r\ngold shekel in the proportion of 13-1/3 to 10, and had therefore the value\r\nof one tenth of a gold shekel; and the half silver shekel, called by the\r\nGreeks a drachma, was worth one twentieth of a gold shekel. The drachma,\r\nor half silver shekel, may therefore be looked upon as the most ancient\r\ntype of our own silver shilling in its relation of one twentieth of our\r\ngold sovereign.(10)\r\n\r\nI shall mention only one more of the most essential tools of our mental\r\nlife—namely, our _figures_, which we call Arabic, because we received them\r\nfrom the Arabs, but which the Arabs called Indian, because they received\r\nthem from the Indians—in order to show you how this nineteenth century of\r\nours is under the sway of centuries long past and forgotten; how we are\r\nwhat we are, not by ourselves, but by those who came before us, and how\r\nthe intellectual ground on which we stand is made up of the detritus of\r\nthoughts which were first thought, not on these isles nor in Europe, but\r\non the shores of the Oxus, the Nile, the Euphrates, and the Indus.\r\n\r\nNow you may well ask, _Quorsum hæc omnia?_ What has all this to do with\r\nfreedom and with the free development of individuality? Because a man is\r\nborn the heir of all the ages, can it be said that he is not free to grow\r\nand to expand, and to develop all the faculties of his mind? Are those who\r\ncame before him, and who left him this goodly inheritance, to be called\r\nhis enemies? Is that chain of tradition which connects him with the past\r\nreally a galling fetter, and not rather the leading-strings without which\r\nhe would never learn to walk straight?\r\n\r\nLet us look at the matter more closely. No one would venture to say that\r\nevery individual should begin life as a young savage, and be left to form\r\nhis own language, and invent his own letters, numerals, and coins. On the\r\ncontrary, if we comprehend all this and a great deal more, such as\r\nreligion, morality, and secular knowledge, under the general name of\r\n_education_, even the most advanced defenders of individualism would hold\r\nthat no child should enter society without submitting, or rather without\r\nbeing submitted, to education. Most of us would even go farther, and make\r\nit criminal for parents or even for communities to allow children to grow\r\nup uneducated. The excuse of worthless parents that they are at liberty to\r\ndo with their children as they like, has at last been blown to the winds,\r\nand among the principal advocates of compulsory education, and of the\r\nnecessity of curtailing the freedom of savage parents of savage children,\r\nhave been Mill and his friends, the apostles of liberty and\r\nindividualism.(11) I remember the time when pseudo-Liberals were not\r\nashamed to say that, whatever other nations, such as the Germans, might\r\ndo, England would never submit to compulsory education; but that\r\nfaint-hearted and mischievous cry has at last been silenced. A new era may\r\nbe said to date in the history of every nation from the day on which\r\n“compulsory education” becomes part of its statute-book; and I may\r\ncongratulate the most Liberal town in England on having proved itself the\r\nmost inexorable tyrant in carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nBut do not let us imagine that compulsory education is without its\r\ndangers. Like a powerful engine, it must be carefully watched, if it is\r\nnot to produce, what all compulsion will produce, a slavish receptivity,\r\nand, what all machines do produce, monotonous uniformity.\r\n\r\nWe know that all education must in the beginning be purely dogmatic.\r\nChildren are taught language, religion, morality, patriotism, and\r\nafterwards, at school, history, literature, mathematics, and all the rest,\r\nlong before they are able to question, to judge, or choose for themselves,\r\nand there is hardly anything that a child will not believe, if it comes\r\nfrom those in whom the child believes.\r\n\r\nReading, writing, and arithmetic, no doubt, must be taught dogmatically,\r\nand they take up an enormous amount of time, particularly in English\r\nschools. English spelling is a national misfortune, and in the keen\r\ninternational race among all the countries of Europe, it handicaps the\r\nEnglish child to a degree that seems incredible till we look at\r\nstatistics. I know the difficulties of a Spelling Reform, I know what\r\npeople mean when they call it impossible; but I also know that personal\r\nand national virtue consists in doing so-called impossible things, and\r\nthat no nation has done, and has still to do, so many impossible things as\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nBut, granted that reading, writing, and arithmetic occupy nearly the whole\r\nschool time and absorb the best powers of the pupils, cannot something be\r\ndone in play-hours? Is there not some work that can be turned into play,\r\nand some play that can be turned into work? Cannot the powers of\r\nobservation be called out in a child while collecting flowers, or stones,\r\nor butterflies? Cannot his judgment be strengthened either in gymnastic\r\nexercises, or in measuring the area of a field or the height of a tower?\r\nMight not all this be done without a view to examinations or payment by\r\nresults, simply for the sake of filling the little dull minds with one\r\nsunbeam of joy, such sunbeams being more likely hereafter to call hidden\r\nprecious germs into life than the deadening weight of such lessons as, for\r\ninstance, that _th-ough_ is though, _thr-ough_ is through, _en-ough_ is\r\nenough. A child who believes that will hereafter believe anything. Those\r\nwho wish to see Natural Science introduced into elementary schools\r\nfrighten school-masters by the very name of Natural Science. But surely\r\nevery school-master who is worth his salt should be able to teach children\r\na love of Nature, a wondering at Nature, a curiosity to pry into the\r\nsecrets of Nature, an acquisitiveness for some of the treasures of Nature,\r\nand all this acquired in the fresh air of the field and the forest, where,\r\nbetter than in frowzy lecture-rooms, the edge of the senses can be\r\nsharpened, the chest widened, and that freedom of thought fostered which\r\nmade England what it was even before the days of compulsory education.\r\n\r\nBut in addressing you here to-night, it was my intention to speak of\r\nhigher rather than of elementary education.\r\n\r\nAll education—as it now exists in most countries of Europe—may be divided\r\ninto three stages—_elementary_, _scholastic_, and _academical_; or call it\r\n_primary_, _secondary_, and _tertiary_.\r\n\r\nElementary education has at last been made compulsory in most civilized\r\ncountries. Unfortunately, however, it seems impossible to include under\r\ncompulsory education anything beyond the very elements of knowledge—at\r\nleast for the present; though I know from experience that, with proper\r\nmanagement, a well-conducted elementary school can afford to provide\r\ninstruction in extra subjects—such as natural science, modern languages,\r\nand political economy—and yet, with the present system of government\r\ngrants, be self-supporting.(12)\r\n\r\nThe next stage above the elementary is _scholastic_ education, as it is\r\nsupplied in grammar schools, whether public or private. According as the\r\npupils are intended either to go on to a university, or to enter at once\r\non leaving school on the practical work of life, these schools are divided\r\ninto two classes. In the one class, which in Germany are called\r\n_Realschulen_, less Latin is taught, and no Greek, but more of\r\nmathematics, modern languages, and physical science; in the other, called\r\n_Gymnasia_ on the Continent, classics form the chief staple of\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nIt is during this stage that education, whether at private or public\r\nschools, exercises its strongest levelling influence. Little attention can\r\nbe paid at large schools to individual tastes or talents. In Germany—even\r\nmore, perhaps, than in England—it is the chief object of a good and\r\nconscientious master to have his class as uniform as possible at the end\r\nof the year; and he receives far more credit from the official examiner if\r\nhis whole class marches well and keeps pace together, than if he can\r\nparade a few brilliant and forward boys, followed by a number of\r\nstraggling laggards.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the character of the teaching at school, how can it be otherwise\r\nthan authoritative or dogmatic? The Sokratic method is very good if we can\r\nfind the _viri Socratici_ and leisure for discussion. But at school, which\r\nnow may seem to be called almost in mockery σχολή, or leisure, the true\r\nmethod is, after all, that patronized by the great educators of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Boys at school must turn their mind\r\ninto a row of pigeon-holes, filling as many as they can with useful notes,\r\nand never forgetting how many are empty. There is an immense amount of\r\npositive knowledge to be acquired between the ages of ten and\r\neighteen—rules of grammar, strings of vocables, dates, names of towns,\r\nrivers, and mountains, mathematical formulas, etc. All depends here on the\r\nreceptive and retentive powers of the mind. The memory has to be\r\nstrengthened, without being overtaxed, till it acts almost mechanically.\r\nLearning by heart, I believe, cannot be too assiduously practised during\r\nthe years spent at school. There may have been too much of it when, as the\r\nRev. H. C. Adams informs us in his “Wykehamica” (p. 357), boys used to say\r\nby heart 13,000 and 14,000 lines, when one repeated the whole of Virgil,\r\nnay, when another was able to say the whole of the English Bible by rote:\r\n“Put him on where you would, he would go fluently on, as long as any one\r\nwould listen.”\r\n\r\nNo intellectual investment, I feel certain, bears such ample and such\r\nregular interest as gems of English, Latin, or Greek literature deposited\r\nin the memory during childhood and youth, and taken up from time to time\r\nin the happy hours of solitude.\r\n\r\nOne fault I have to find with most schools, both in England and on the\r\nContinent. Boys do not read enough of the Greek and Roman classics. The\r\nmajority of our masters are scholars by profession, and they are apt to\r\nlay undue stress on what they call accurate and minute scholarship, and to\r\nneglect wide and cursory reading. I know the arguments for minute\r\naccuracy, but I also know the mischief that is done by an exclusive\r\ndevotion to critical scholarship before we have acquired a real\r\nfamiliarity with the principal works of classical literature. The time\r\nspent in our schools in learning the rules of grammar and syntax, writing\r\nexercises, and composing verses, is too large. Look only at our Greek and\r\nLatin grammars, with all their rules and exceptions, and exceptions on\r\nexceptions! It is too heavy a weight for any boy to carry; and no wonder\r\nthat when one of the thousand small rules which they have learnt by heart\r\nis really wanted, it is seldom forthcoming. The end of classical teaching\r\nat school should be to make our boys acquainted, not only with the\r\nlanguage, but with the literature and history, the ancient thought of the\r\nancient world. Rules of grammar, syntax, or metre, are but means towards\r\nthat end; they must never be mistaken for the end itself. A young man of\r\neighteen, who has probably spent on an average ten years in learning Greek\r\nand Latin, ought to be able to read any of the ordinary Greek or Latin\r\nclassics without much difficulty; nay, with a certain amount of pleasure.\r\nHe might have to consult his dictionary now and then, or guess the meaning\r\nof certain words; he might also feel doubtful sometime whether certain\r\nforms came from ἵημι, I send, or εἶμι, I go, or εἰμί, I am, particularly\r\nif preceded by prepositions. In these matters the best scholars are least\r\ninclined to be pharisaical; and whenever I meet in the controversies of\r\nclassical scholars the favorite phrase, “Every school-boy knows, or ought\r\nto know, this,” I generally say to myself, “No, he ought not.” Anyhow,\r\nthose who wish to see the study of Greek and Latin retained in our public\r\nschools ought to feel convinced that it will certainly not be retained\r\nmuch longer, if it can be said with any truth that young men who leave\r\nschool at eighteen are in many cases unable to read or to enjoy a\r\nclassical text, unless they have seen it before.\r\n\r\nClassical teaching, and all purely scholastic teaching, ought to be\r\nfinished at school. When a young man goes to a University, unless he means\r\nto make scholarship his profession, he ought to be free to enter upon a\r\nnew career. If he has not learnt by that time so much of Greek and Latin\r\nas is absolutely necessary in after-life for a lawyer, or a student of\r\nphysical science, or even a clergyman, either he or his school is to\r\nblame. I do not mean to say that it would not be most desirable for every\r\none during his University career to attend some lectures on classical\r\nliterature, on ancient history, philosophy, or art. What is to be\r\ndeprecated is, that the University should have to do the work which\r\nbelongs properly to the school.\r\n\r\nThe best colleges at Oxford and Cambridge have shown by their\r\nmatriculation examinations what the standard of classical knowledge ought\r\nto be at eighteen or nineteen. That standard can be reached by boys while\r\nstill at school, as has been proved both by the so-called local\r\nexaminations, and by the examinations of schools held under the Delegates\r\nappointed by the Universities. If, therefore, the University would\r\nreassert her old right, and make the first examination, called at Oxford\r\nResponsions, a general matriculation examination for admission to the\r\nUniversity, not only would the public schools be stimulated to greater\r\nefforts, but the teaching of the University might assume, from the very\r\nbeginning, that academic character which ought to distinguish it from mere\r\nschool-boy work.\r\n\r\nAcademic teaching ought to be not merely a continuation, but in one sense\r\na correction of scholastic teaching. While at school instruction must be\r\nchiefly dogmatic, at the University is it to be Sokratic? for I find no\r\nbetter name for that method which is to set a man free from the burden of\r\npurely traditional knowledge; to make him feel that the words which he\r\nuses are often empty, that the concepts he employs are, for the most part,\r\nmere bundles picked up at random; that even where he knows facts he does\r\nnot know the evidence for them; and where he expresses opinions, they are\r\nmostly mere dogmas, adopted by him without examination.\r\n\r\nBut for the Universities, I should indeed fear that Mill’s prophecies\r\nmight come true, and that the intellect of Europe might drift into dreary\r\nmonotony. The Universities always have been, and, unless they are diverted\r\nfrom their original purpose, always will be, the guardians of the freedom\r\nof thought, the protectors of individual spontaneity; and it was owing, I\r\nbelieve, to Mill’s want of acquaintance with true academic teaching that\r\nhe took so desponding a view of the generation growing up under his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen we leave school, our heads are naturally brimful of dogma—that is, of\r\nknowledge and opinions at second-hand. Such dead knowledge is extremely\r\ndangerous, unless it is sooner or later revived by the spirit of free\r\ninquiry. It does not matter whether our scholastic dogmas be true or\r\nfalse. The danger is the same. And why? Because to place either truth or\r\nerror above the reach of argument is certain to weaken truth and to\r\nstrengthen error. Secondly, because to hold as true on the authority of\r\nothers anything which concerns us deeply, and which we could prove\r\nourselves, produces feebleness, if not dishonesty. And, thirdly, because\r\nto feel unwilling or unable to meet objections by argument is generally\r\nthe first step towards violence and persecution.\r\n\r\nI do not think of religious dogmas only. They are generally the first to\r\nrouse inquiry, even during our school-boy days, and they are by no means\r\nthe most difficult to deal with. Dogma often rages where we least expect\r\nit. Among scientific men the theory of evolution is at present becoming,\r\nor has become, a dogma. What is the result? No objections are listened to,\r\nno difficulties recognized, and a man like Virchow, himself the strongest\r\nsupporter of evolution, who has the moral courage to say that the descent\r\nof man from any ape whatsoever is, as yet, before the tribunal of\r\nscientific zoölogy, “not proven,” is howled down in Germany in a manner\r\nworthy of Ephesians and Galatians. But at present I am thinking not so\r\nmuch of any special dogmas, but rather of that dogmatic state of mind\r\nwhich is the almost inevitable result of the teaching at school. I think\r\nof the whole intellect, what has been called the _intellectus sibi\r\npermissus_, and I maintain it is the object of academic teaching to rouse\r\nthat intellect out of its slumber by questions not less startling than\r\nwhen Galileo asked the world whether the sun was really moving and the\r\nearth stood still; or when Kant asked whether time and space were objects,\r\nor necessary forms of our sensuous intuition. Till our opinions have thus\r\nbeen tested and stood the test, we can hardly call them our own.\r\n\r\nHow true this is with regard to religion has been boldly expressed by\r\nBishop Beveridge.\r\n\r\n“Being conscious to myself,” he writes in his “Private Thoughts on\r\nReligion,” “how great an ascendant Christianity holds over me beyond the\r\nrest, as being that religion whereinto I was born and baptized; that which\r\nthe supreme authority has enjoined and my parents educated me in; that\r\nwhich every one I meet withal highly approves of, and which I myself have,\r\nby a long-continued profession, made almost natural to me: I am resolved\r\nto be more jealous and suspicious of this religion than of the rest, and\r\nbe sure not to entertain it any longer without being convinced, by solid\r\nand substantial arguments, of the truth and certainty of it.”\r\n\r\nThis is bold and manly language from a Bishop, nearly two hundred years\r\nago, and I certainly think that the time has come when some of the\r\ndivinity lecturers at Oxford and Cambridge might well be employed in\r\nplacing a knowledge of the sacred books of other religions within the\r\nreach of undergraduates. Many of the difficulties—most of them of our own\r\nmaking—with regard to the origin, the handing down, the later corruptions\r\nand misinterpretations of sacred texts, would find their natural solution,\r\nif it was shown how exactly the same difficulties arose and had to be\r\ndealt with by theologians of other creeds. If some—aye, if many—of the\r\ndoctrines of Christianity were met with in other religions also, surely\r\nthat would not affect their value, or diminish their truth; while nothing,\r\nI feel certain, would more effectually secure to the pure and simple\r\nteaching of Christ its true place in the historical development of the\r\nhuman mind than to place it side by side with the other religions of the\r\nworld. In the series of translations of the “Sacred Books of the East,” of\r\nwhich the first three volumes have just appeared,(13) I wished myself to\r\ninclude a new translation of the Old and New Testaments; and when that\r\nseries is finished it will, I believe, be admitted that nowhere would\r\nthese two books have had a grander setting, or have shone with a brighter\r\nlight, than surrounded by the Veda, the Zendavesta, the Buddhist\r\nTripi_t_aka, and the Qurân.\r\n\r\nBut as I said before, I was not thinking of religious dogmas only, or even\r\nchiefly, when I maintained that the character of academic teaching must be\r\nSokratic, not dogmatic. The evil of dogmatic teaching lies much deeper,\r\nand spreads much farther.\r\n\r\nThink only of language, the work of other people, not of ourselves, which\r\nwe pick up at random in our race through life. Does not every word we use\r\nrequire careful examination and revision? It is not enough to say that\r\nlanguage assists our thoughts or colors them, or possibly obscures them.\r\nNo language and thought are indivisible. It was not from poverty of\r\nexpression that the Greeks called reason and language by the same word,\r\nλόγος. It was because they knew that, though we may distinguish between\r\nthought and speech, as we distinguish between force and function, it is as\r\nimpossible to tear the one by violence away from the other as it is to\r\nseparate the concave side of a lens from its convex side. This is\r\nsomething to learn and to understand, for, if, properly understood, will\r\nit supply the key to most of our intellectual puzzles, and serve as the\r\nsafest thread through the whole labyrinth of philosophy.\r\n\r\n“It is evident,” as Hobbes remarks,(14) “that truth and falsity have no\r\nplace but amongst such living creatures as use speech. For though some\r\nbrute creatures, looking upon the image of a man in a glass, may be\r\naffected with it, as if it were the man himself, and for this reason fear\r\nit or fawn upon it in vain; yet they do not apprehend it as true or false,\r\nbut only as like; and in this they are not deceived. Wherefore, as men owe\r\nall their true ratiocination to the right understanding of speech, so also\r\nthey owe their errors to the misunderstanding of the same; and as all the\r\nornaments of philosophy proceed only from man, so from man also is derived\r\nthe ugly absurdity of false opinion. For speech has something in it like\r\nto a spider’s web (as it was said of old of Solon’s laws), for by\r\ncontexture of words tender and delicate wits are ensnared or stopped, but\r\nstrong wits break easily through them.”\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate my meaning by at least one instance.\r\n\r\nAmong the words which have proved spider’s webs, ensnaring even the\r\ngreatest intellects of the world from Aristotle down to Leibniz, the terms\r\n_genus_, _species_, and _individual_ occupy a very prominent place. The\r\nopposition of Aristotle to Plato, of the Nominalists to the Realists, of\r\nLeibniz to Locke, of Herbart to Hegel, turns on the true meaning of these\r\nwords. At school, of course, all we can do is to teach the received\r\nmeaning of _genus_ and _species_; and if a boy can trace these terms back\r\nto Aristotle’s γένος and εἶδος, and show in what sense that philosopher\r\nused them, every examiner would be satisfied.\r\n\r\nBut the time comes when we have to act as our own examiners, and when we\r\nhave to give an account to ourselves of such words as _genus_ and\r\n_species_. Some people write, indeed, as if they had seen a _species_ and\r\na _genus_ walking about in broad daylight; but a little consideration will\r\nshow us that these words express subjective concepts, and that, if the\r\nwhole world were silent, there would never have been a thought of a\r\n_genus_ or a _species_. There are languages in which we look in vain for\r\ncorresponding words; and if we had been born in the atmosphere of such a\r\nlanguage, these terms and thoughts would not exist for us. They came to\r\nus, directly or indirectly, from Aristotle. But Aristotle did not invent\r\nthem, he only defined them in his own way, so that, for instance,\r\naccording to him, all living beings would constitute a _genus_, men a\r\n_species_, and Sokrates an _individual_.\r\n\r\nNo one would say that Aristotle had not a perfect right to define these\r\nterms, if those who use them in his sense would only always remember that\r\nthey are thinking the thoughts of Aristotle, and not their own. The true\r\nway to shake off the fetters of old words, and to learn to think our own\r\nthoughts, is to follow them up from century to century, to watch their\r\ndevelopment, and in the end to bring ourselves face to face with those who\r\nfirst found and framed both words and thoughts. If we do this with _genus_\r\nand _species_, we shall find that the words which Aristotle defined—viz.,\r\nγένος and εἶδος—had originally a very different and far more useful\r\napplication than that which he gave to them. γένος, _genus_, meant\r\ngeneration, and comprehended such living beings only as were believed to\r\nhave a common origin, however they might differ in outward appearance, as,\r\nfor instance, the spaniel and the bloodhound, or, according to Darwin, the\r\nape and the man. εἶδος, or species, on the contrary, meant appearance, and\r\ncomprehended all such things as had the same form or appearance, whether\r\nthey had a common origin or not, as if we were to speak of a species of\r\nfour-footed, two-footed, horned, winged, or blue animals.\r\n\r\nThat two such concepts, as we have here explained, had a natural\r\njustification we may best learn from the fact that exactly the same\r\nthoughts found expression in Sanskrit. There, too, we find _g_âti,\r\ngeneration, used in the sense of _genus,_ and opposed to âk_ri_ti,\r\nappearance, used in the sense of _species_.\r\n\r\nSo long as these two words or thoughts were used independently (much as we\r\nnow speak of a genealogical as independent of a morphological\r\nclassification) no harm could accrue. A family, for instance, might be\r\ncalled a γένος, the _gens_ or clan was a γένος, the nation (_gnatio_) was\r\na γένος, the whole human kith and kin was a γένος; in fact, all that was\r\ndescended from common ancestors was a true γένος. There is no obscurity of\r\nthought in this.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, taking εἶδος or species in its original sense, one man\r\nmight be said to be like another in his εἶδος or appearance. An ape, too,\r\nmight quite truly be said to have the same εἶδος or species or appearance\r\nas a man, without any prejudice as to their common origin. People might\r\nalso speak of different εἴδη or forms or classes of things, such as\r\ndifferent kinds of metals, or tools, or armor, without committing\r\nthemselves in the least to any opinion as to their common descent.\r\n\r\nOften it would happen that things belonging to the same εἶδος, such as the\r\nwhite man and the negro, differed in their εἶδος or appearance; often also\r\nthat things belonged to the same εἶδος, such as eatables, differed in\r\ntheir γένος, as, for instance, meat and vegetables.\r\n\r\nAll this is clear and simple. The confusion began when these two terms,\r\ninstead of being coördinate, were subordinated to each other by the\r\nphilosophers of Greece, so that what from one point of view was called a\r\n_genus_, might from another be called a species, and _vice versâ_. Human\r\nbeings, for instance, were now called a _species_, all living beings a\r\n_genus_, which may be true in logic, but is utterly false in what is older\r\nthan logic—viz., language, thought, or fact. According to language,\r\naccording to reason, and according to nature, all human beings constitute\r\na γένος, or generation, so long as they are supposed to have common\r\nancestors; but with regard to all living beings we can only say that they\r\nform an εἶδος—that is, agree in certain appearances, until it has been\r\nproved that even Mr. Darwin was too modest in admitting at least four or\r\nfive different ancestors for the whole animal world.(15)\r\n\r\nIn tracing the history of these two words, γένος and εἶδος, you may see\r\npassing before your eyes almost the whole panorama of philosophy, from\r\nPlato’s \"ideas\" down to Hegel’s _Idee_. The question of _genera_, their\r\norigin and subdivision, occupied chiefly the attention of natural\r\nphilosophers, who, after long controversies about the origin and\r\nclassification of _genera_ and _species_, seem at last, thanks to the\r\nclear sight of Darwin, to have arrived at the old truth which was\r\nprefigured in language—namely, that Nature knows nothing but _genera_, or\r\ngenerations, to be traced back to a limited number of ancestors, and that\r\nthe so-called _species_ are only _genera_, whose genealogical descent is\r\n_as yet_ more or less obscure.\r\n\r\nBut the question as to the nature of the εἶδος became a vital question in\r\nevery system of philosophy. Granting, for instance, that women in every\r\nclime and country formed one species, it was soon asked what constituted a\r\nspecies? If all women shared a common form, what was that form? Where was\r\nit? So long as it was supposed that all women descended from Eve, the\r\ndifficulty might be slurred over by the name of heredity. But the more\r\nthoughtful would ask even then how it was that, while all individual women\r\ncame and went and vanished, the form in which they were cast remained the\r\nsame?\r\n\r\nHere you see how philosophical mythology springs up. The very question\r\nwhat εἶδος or species or form was, and where these things were kept,\r\nchanged those words from predicates into subjects. εἶδος was conceived as\r\nsomething independent and substantial, something within or above the\r\nindividuals participating in it, something unchangeable and eternal. Soon\r\nthere arose as many εἴδη or forms or types as there were general concepts.\r\nThey were considered the only true realities of which the phenomenal world\r\nis only as a shadow that soon passeth away. Here we have, in fact, the\r\norigin of Plato’s ideas, and of the various systems of idealism which\r\nfollowed his lead, while the opposite opinion that ideas have no\r\nindependent existence, and that the one is nowhere found except in the\r\nmany (τὸ ἕν παρὰ τὰ πολλά), was strenuously defended by Aristotle and his\r\nfollowers.(16)\r\n\r\nThe same red thread runs through the whole philosophy of the Middle Ages.\r\nMen were cited before councils and condemned as heretics because they\r\ndeclared that _animal_, _man_, or _woman_ were mere names, and that they\r\ncould not bring themselves to believe in an ideal animal, an ideal man, an\r\nideal woman as the invisible, supernatural, or metaphysical types of the\r\nordinary animal, the individual man, the single woman. Those philosophers,\r\ncalled _Nominalists_, in opposition to the _Realists_, declared that all\r\ngeneral terms were _names only_, and that nothing could claim reality but\r\nthe individual.\r\n\r\nWe cannot follow this controversy farther, as it turns up again between\r\nLocke and Leibniz, between Herbart and Hegel. Suffice it to say that the\r\nknot, as it was tied by language, can be untied by the science of language\r\nalone, which teaches us that there is and can be no such thing as “a name\r\nonly.” That phrase ought to be banished from all works on philosophy. A\r\nname is and always has been the subjective side of our knowledge, but that\r\nsubjective side is as impossible without an objective side as a key is\r\nwithout a lock. It is useless to ask which of the two is the more real,\r\nfor they are real only by being, not two, but one. Realism is as one-sided\r\nas Nominalism. But there is a higher Nominalism, which might better be\r\ncalled the Science of Language, and which teaches us that, apart from\r\nsensuous perception, all human knowledge is by names and by names only,\r\nand that the object of names is always the general.\r\n\r\nThis is but one out of hundreds and thousands of cases to show how names\r\nand concepts which come to us by tradition must be submitted to very\r\ncareful snuffing before they will yield a pure light. What I mean by\r\nacademic teaching and academic study is exactly this process of snuffing,\r\nthis changing of traditional words into living words, this tracing of\r\nmodern thought back to ancient primitive thought, this living, as it were,\r\nonce more, so far as it concerns us, the whole history of human thought\r\nourselves, till we are as little afraid to differ from Plato or Aristotle\r\nas from Comte or Darwin.\r\n\r\nPlato and Aristotle are, no doubt, great names; every school-boy is awed\r\nby them, even though he may have read very little of their writings. This,\r\ntoo, is a kind of dogmatism that requires correction. Now, at his\r\nUniversity, a young student might chance to hear the following, by no\r\nmeans respectful, remarks about Aristotle, which I copy from one of the\r\ngreatest English scholars and philosophers: “There is nothing so absurd\r\nthat the old philosophers, as Cicero saith, who was one of them, have not\r\nsome of them maintained; and I believe that scarce anything can be more\r\nabsurdly said in natural philosophy than that which now is called\r\nAristotle’s Metaphysics; or more repugnant to government than much of that\r\nhe hath said in his Politics; nor more ignorantly than a great part of his\r\nEthics.” I am far from approving this judgment, but I think that the shock\r\nwhich a young scholar receives on seeing his idols so mercilessly broken\r\nis salutary. It throws him back on his own resources; it makes him honest\r\nto himself. If he thinks the criticism thus passed on Aristotle unfair, he\r\nwill begin to read his works with new eyes. He will not only construe his\r\nwords, but try to reconstruct in his own mind the thoughts so carefully\r\nelaborated by that ancient philosopher. He will judge of their truth\r\nwithout being swayed by the authority of a great name, and probably in the\r\nend value what is valuable in Aristotle, or Plato, or any other great\r\nphilosopher far more highly and honestly than if he had never seen them\r\ntrodden under foot.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose that I look upon the Universities as purely iconoclastic,\r\nas chiefly intended to teach us how to break the idols of the schools. Far\r\nfrom it! But I do look upon them as meant to supply a fresher atmosphere\r\nthan we breathed at school, and to shake our mind to its very roots, as a\r\nstorm shakes the young oaks, not to throw them down, but to make them\r\ngrasp all the more firmly the hard soil of fact and truth! “_Stand upright\r\non thy feet_” ought to be written over the gate of every college, if the\r\nepidemic of uniformity and sequacity which Mill saw approaching from\r\nChina, and which since his time has made such rapid progress Westward, is\r\never to be stayed.\r\n\r\nAcademic freedom is not without its dangers; but there are dangers which\r\nit is safer to face than to avoid. In Germany—so far as my own experience\r\ngoes—students are often left too much to themselves, and it is only the\r\ncleverest among them, or those who are personally recommended, who receive\r\nfrom the professors that individual guidance and encouragement which\r\nshould and could be easily extended to all.\r\n\r\nThere is too much time spent in the German Universities in mere lecturing,\r\nand often in simply retailing to a class what each student might read in\r\nbooks in a far more perfect form. Lectures are useful if they teach us how\r\nto teach ourselves; if they stimulate; if they excite sympathy and\r\ncuriosity; if they give advice that springs from personal experience; if\r\nthey warn against wrong roads; if, in fact, they have less the character\r\nof a show-window than of a workshop. Half an hour’s conversation with a\r\ntutor or a professor often does more than a whole course of lectures in\r\ngiving the right direction and the right spirit to a young man’s studies.\r\nHere I may quote the words of Professor Helmholtz, in full agreement with\r\nhim. “When I recall the memory of my own University life,” he writes, “and\r\nthe impression which a man like Johannes Müller, the professor of\r\nphysiology, made on us, I must set the highest value on the personal\r\nintercourse with teachers from whom one learns how thought works in\r\nindependent heads. Whoever has come in contact but once with one or\r\nseveral first-class men will find his intellectual standard changed for\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nIn English Universities, on the contrary, there is too little of academic\r\nfreedom. There is not only guidance, but far too much of constant personal\r\ncontrol. It is often thought that English undergraduates could not be\r\ntrusted with that amount of academic freedom which is granted to German\r\nstudents, and that most of them, if left to choose their own work, their\r\nown time, their own books, and their own teachers, would simply do\r\nnothing. This seems to me unfair and untrue. Most horses, if you take them\r\nto the water, will drink; and the best way to make them drink is to leave\r\nthem alone. I have lived long enough in English and in German Universities\r\nto know that the intellectual fibre is as strong and sound in the English\r\nas in the German youth. But if you supply a man, who wishes to learn\r\nswimming, with bladders—nay, if you insist on his using them—he will use\r\nthem, but he will probably never learn to swim. Take them away, on the\r\ncontrary, and depend on it, after a few aimless strokes and a few painful\r\ngulps, he will use his arms and his legs, and he will swim. If young men\r\ndo not learn to use their arms, their legs, their muscles, their senses,\r\ntheir brain, and their heart too, during the bright years of their\r\nUniversity life, when are they to learn it? True, there are thousands who\r\nnever learn it, and who float happily on through life buoyed up on mere\r\nbladders. The worst that can happen to them is that some day the bladders\r\nmay burst, and they may be left stranded or drowned. But these are not the\r\nmen whom England wants to fight her battles. It has often been pointed out\r\nof late that many of those who during this century have borne the brunt of\r\nthe battle in the intellectual warfare in England, have not been trained\r\nat our Universities, while others who have been at Oxford and Cambridge,\r\nand have distinguished themselves in after life, have openly declared that\r\nthey attended hardly any lectures in college, or that they derived no\r\nbenefit from them. What can be the ground of that? Not that there is less\r\nwork done at Oxford than at Leipzig, but that the work is done in a\r\ndifferent spirit. It is free in Germany; it has now become almost\r\ncompulsory in England. Though an old professor myself, I like to attend,\r\nwhen I can, some of the professorial lectures in Germany; for it is a real\r\npleasure to see hundreds of young faces listening to a teacher on the\r\nhistory of art, on modern history, on the science of language, or on\r\nphilosophy, without any view to examinations, simply from love of the\r\nsubject or of the teacher. No one who knows what the real joy of learning\r\nis, how it lightens all drudgery and draws away the mind from mean\r\npursuits, can see without indignation that what ought to be the freest and\r\nhappiest years in a man’s life should often be spent between cramming and\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\nAnd here I have at last mentioned the word, which to many friends of\r\nacademic freedom, to many who dread the baneful increase of uniformity,\r\nmay seem the cause of all mischief, the most powerful engine for\r\nintellectual levelling—_Examination_.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong feeling springing up everywhere against the tyranny of\r\nexaminations, against the cramping and withering influence which they are\r\nsupposed to exercise on the youth of England. I cannot join in that\r\noutcry. I well remember that the first letters which I ventured to address\r\nto the _Times_, in very imperfect English, were in favor of examinations.\r\nThey were signed _La Carrière ouverte_, and were written before the days\r\nof the Civil Service Commission! I well remember, too, that the first time\r\nI ventured to speak, or rather to stammer, in public, was in favor of\r\nexaminations. That was in 1857, at Exeter, when the first experiment was\r\nmade, under the auspices of Sir T. Acland, in the direction of what has\r\nsince developed into the Oxford and Cambridge Local Examinations. I have\r\nbeen an examiner myself for many years, I have watched the growth of that\r\nsystem in England from year to year, and, in spite of all that has been\r\nsaid and written of late against it, I confess I do not see how it would\r\nbe possible to abolish it, and return to the old system of appointment by\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\nBut though I have not lost my faith in examinations, I cannot conceal the\r\nfact that I am frightened by the manner in which they are conducted, and\r\nby the results which they produce. As you are interested yourselves at\r\nthis Midland Institute in the successful working of examinations, you will\r\nperhaps allow me in conclusion to add a few remarks on the safeguards\r\nnecessary for the efficient working of examinations.\r\n\r\nAll examinations are a means to ascertain how pupils have been taught;\r\nthey ought never to be allowed to become the end for which pupils are\r\ntaught. Teaching with a view to them lowers the teacher in the eyes of his\r\npupils; learning with a view to them is apt to produce shallowness and\r\ndishonesty.\r\n\r\nWhatever attractions learning possesses in itself, and whatever efforts\r\nwere formerly made by boys at school from a sense of duty, all this is\r\nlost if they once imagine that the highest object of all learning is to\r\ngain marks in a competition.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain the proper relation between teacher and pupil, all\r\npupils should be made to look to their teachers as their natural examiners\r\nand fairest judges, and therefore in every examination the report of the\r\nteacher ought to carry the greatest weight. This is the principle followed\r\nabroad in examining candidates at public schools; and even in their\r\nexamination on leaving school, which gives them the right to enter the\r\nUniversity, they know that their success depends far more on the work\r\nwhich they have done during the years at school, than on the work done on\r\nthe few days of their examination. There are outside examiners appointed\r\nby Government to check the work done at schools and during the\r\nexaminations; but the cases in which they have to modify or reverse the\r\naward of the master are extremely rare, and they are felt to reflect\r\nseriously on the competency or impartiality of the school authorities.\r\n\r\nTo leave examinations entirely to strangers reduces them to the level of\r\nlotteries, and fosters a cleverness in teachers and taught often akin to\r\ndishonesty. An examiner may find out what a candidate knows _not_, he can\r\nhardly ever find out all he knows; and even if he succeeds in finding out\r\n_how much_ a candidate knows, he can seldom find out _how_ he knows it. On\r\nthese points the opinion of the masters who have watched their pupils for\r\nyears is indispensable for the sake of the examiner, for the sake of the\r\npupils, and for the sake of their teachers.\r\n\r\nI know I shall be told that it would be impossible to trust the masters,\r\nand to be guided by their opinion, because they are interested parties.\r\nNow, first of all, there are far more honest men in the world than\r\ndishonest, and it does not answer to legislate as if all school-masters\r\nwere rogues. It is enough that they should know that their reports would\r\nbe scrutinized, to keep even the most reprobate of teachers from bearing\r\nfalse witness in favor of their pupils.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I believe that unnecessary temptation is now being placed before\r\nall parties concerned in examinations. The proper reward for a good\r\nexamination should be honor, not pounds, shillings, and pence. The\r\nmischief done by pecuniary rewards offered in the shape of scholarships\r\nand exhibitions at school and University, begins to be recognized very\r\nwidely. To train a boy of twelve for a race against all England is\r\ngenerally to overstrain his faculties, and often to impair his usefulness\r\nin later life; but to make him feel that by his failure he will entail on\r\nhis father the loss of a hundred a year, and on his teacher the loss of\r\npupils, is simply cruel at that early age.\r\n\r\nIt is said that these scholarships and exhibitions enable the sons of poor\r\nparents to enjoy the privilege of the best education in England, from\r\nwhich they would otherwise be debarred by the excessive costliness of our\r\npublic schools. But even this argument, strong as it seems, can hardly\r\nstand, for I believe it could be shown that the majority of those who are\r\nsuccessful in obtaining scholarships and exhibitions at school or at the\r\nUniversity are boys whose parents have been able to pay the highest price\r\nfor their children’s previous education. If all these prizes were\r\nabolished, and the funds thus set free used to lessen the price of\r\neducation at school and in college, I believe that the sons of poor\r\nparents would be far more benefited than by the present system. It might\r\nalso be desirable to lower the school fees in the case of the sons of poor\r\nparents, who were doing well at school from year to year; and, in order to\r\nguard against favoritism, an examination, particularly _vivâ voce_, before\r\nall the masters of a school, possibly even with some outside examiner,\r\nmight be useful. But the present system bids fair to degenerate into mere\r\nhorse-racing, and I shall not wonder if, sooner or later, the two-year\r\nolds entered for the race have to be watched by their trainer that they\r\nmay not be overfed or drugged against the day of the race. It has come to\r\nthis, that schools are bidding for clever boys in order to run them in the\r\nraces, and in France, I read, that parents actually extort money from\r\nschools by threatening to take away the young racers that are likely to\r\nwin the Derby.(17)\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the schools to the Universities we find here, too, the\r\nsame complaints against over-examination. Now it seems to me that every\r\nUniversity, in order to maintain its position, has a perfect right to\r\ndemand two examinations, but no more: one for admission, the other for a\r\ndegree. Various attempts have been made in Germany, in Russia, in France,\r\nand in England to change and improve the old academic tradition, but in\r\nthe end the original, and, as it would seem, the natural system, has\r\ngenerally proved its wisdom and reasserted its right.\r\n\r\nIf a University surrenders the right of examining those who wish to be\r\nadmitted, the tutors will often have to do the work of school-masters, and\r\nthe professors can never know how high or how low they should aim in their\r\npublic lectures; and the result will be a lowering of the standard at the\r\nUniversities, and consequently at the public schools. Some Universities,\r\non the contrary, like over-anxious mothers, have multiplied examinations\r\nso as to make quite sure, at the end of each term or each year, that the\r\npupils confided to them have done at least some work. This kind of forced\r\nlabor may do some good to the incorrigibly idle, but it does the greatest\r\nharm to all the rest. If there is an examination at the end of each year,\r\nthere can be no freedom left for any independent work. Both teachers and\r\ntaught will be guided by the same pole-star—examinations; no deviation\r\nfrom the beaten track will be considered safe, and all the pleasure\r\nderived from work done for its own sake, and all the just pride and joy,\r\nwhich those only know who have ever ventured out by themselves on the open\r\nsea of knowledge, must be lost.\r\n\r\nWe must not allow ourselves to be deceived by the brilliant show of\r\nexamination papers.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly marvellous what an amount of knowledge candidates will\r\nproduce before their examiners; but those who have been both examined and\r\nexaminers know best how fleeting that knowledge often is, and how\r\ndifferent from that other knowledge which has been acquired slowly and\r\nquietly, for its own sake, for our own sake, without a thought as to\r\nwhether it would ever pay at examinations or not. A candidate, after\r\ngiving most glibly the dates and the titles of the principal works of\r\nCobbett, Gibbon, Burke, Adam Smith, and David Hume, was asked whether he\r\nhad ever seen any of their writings, and he had to answer, No. Another who\r\nwas asked which of the works of Pheidias he had seen, replied that he had\r\nonly read the first two books. This is the kind of dishonest knowledge\r\nwhich is fostered by too frequent examinations. There are two kinds of\r\nknowledge, the one that enters into our very blood, the other which we\r\ncarry about in our pockets. Those who read for examinations have generally\r\ntheir pockets cram full; those who work on quietly and have their whole\r\nheart in their work are often discouraged at the small amount of their\r\nknowledge, at the little life-blood they have made. But what they have\r\nlearnt has really become their own, has invigorated their whole frame, and\r\nin the end they have often proved the strongest and happiest men in the\r\nbattle of life.\r\n\r\nOmniscience is at present the bane of all our knowledge. From the day he\r\nleaves school and enters the University a man ought to make up his mind\r\nthat in many things he must either remain altogether ignorant, or be\r\nsatisfied with knowledge at second-hand. Thus only can he clear the decks\r\nfor action. And the sooner he finds out what his own work is to be, the\r\nmore useful and delightful will be his life at the University and later.\r\nThere are few men who have a passion for all knowledge; there is hardly\r\none who has not a hobby of his own. Those so-called hobbies ought to be\r\nutilized, and not, as they are now, discouraged, if we wish our\r\nUniversities to produce more men like Faraday, Carlyle, Grote, or Darwin.\r\nI do not say that in an examination for a University degree a minimum of\r\nwhat is now called general culture should not be insisted on; but in\r\naddition to that, far more freedom ought to be given to the examiner to\r\nlet each candidate produce his own individual work. This is done to a far\r\ngreater extent in Continental than in English Universities, and the\r\nexaminations are therefore mostly confided to the members of the _Senatus\r\nAcademicus_, consisting of the most experienced teachers, and the most\r\neminent representatives of the different branches of knowledge in the\r\nUniversity. Their object is not to find out how many marks each candidate\r\nmay gain by answering a larger or smaller number of questions, and then to\r\nplace them in order before the world like so many organ pipes. They want\r\nto find out whether a man, by the work he has done during his three or\r\nfour University years, has acquired that vigor of thought, that maturity\r\nof judgment, and that special knowledge, which fairly entitle him to an\r\nacademic degree, with or without special honors. Such a degree confers no\r\nmaterial advantages;(18) it does not entitle its holder to any employment\r\nin Church or State; it does not vouch even for his being a fit person to\r\nbe made an Archbishop or Prime Minister. All this is left to the later\r\nstruggle for life; and in that struggle it seems as if those who, after\r\nhaving surveyed the vast field of human knowledge, have settled on a few\r\nacres of their own and cultivated them as they were never cultivated\r\nbefore, who have worked hard and have tasted the true joy and happiness of\r\nhard work, who have gladly listened to others, but always depended on\r\nthemselves, were, after all, the men whom great nations delighted to\r\nfollow as their royal leaders in the onward march towards greater\r\nenlightenment, greater happiness, and greater freedom.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, no one can read Mill’s Essay “On Liberty” at the present moment\r\nwithout feeling that even during the short period of the last twenty years\r\nthe cause which he advocated so strongly and passionately, the cause of\r\nindividual freedom, has made rapid progress—aye, has carried the day. In\r\nno country _may_ a man be so entirely himself, so true to himself, and yet\r\nloyal to society, as in England.\r\n\r\nBut, although the enemy whose encroachments Mill feared most and resented\r\nmost has been driven back and forced to keep within his own bounds—though\r\nsuch names as Dissenter and Nonconformist, which were formerly used in\r\nsociety as fatal darts, seem to have lost all the poison which they once\r\ncontained—Mill’s principal fears have nevertheless not been belied, and\r\nthe blight of uniformity which he saw approaching with its attendant evils\r\nof feebleness, indifference, and sequacity, has been spreading more widely\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nIt has ever been maintained that the very freedom which every individual\r\nnow enjoys has been detrimental to the growth of individuality; that you\r\nmust have an Inquisition if you want to see martyrs, that you must have\r\ndespotism and tyranny to call forth heroes. The very measures which the\r\nfriends of individual development advocated so warmly, compulsory\r\neducation and competitive examinations, are pointed out as having chiefly\r\ncontributed to produce that large array of pass-men, that dead level of\r\nuninteresting excellence, which is the _beau idéal_ of a Chinese Mandarin,\r\nwhile it frightened and disheartened such men as Humboldt, Tocqueville,\r\nand John Stuart Mill himself.\r\n\r\nThere may be some truth in all this, but it is certainly not the whole\r\ntruth. Education, as it has to be carried on, whether in elementary or in\r\npublic schools, is no doubt a heavy weight which might well press down the\r\nmost independent spirit; it is, in fact, neither more nor less than\r\nplacing, in a systematized form, on the shoulders of every generation the\r\never-increasing mass of knowledge, experience, custom, and tradition that\r\nhas been accumulated by former generations. We need not wonder, therefore,\r\nif in some schools all spring, all vigor, all joyousness of work is\r\ncrushed out under that load of names and dates, of anomalous verbs and\r\nsyntactic rules, of mathematical formulas and geometrical theories which\r\nboys are expected to bring up for competitive examinations.\r\n\r\nBut a remedy has been provided, and we are ourselves to blame if we do not\r\navail ourselves of it to the fullest extent. Europe erected its\r\nUniversities, and called them the homes of the Liberal Arts, and\r\ndetermined that between the mental slavery of the school and the physical\r\nslavery of busy life every man should have at least three years of\r\nfreedom. What Sokrates and his great pupil Plato had done for the youth of\r\nGreece,(19) these new academies were to do for the youth of Italy, France,\r\nEngland, Spain, and Germany; and, though with varying success, they have\r\ndone it. The mediæval and modern Universities have been from century to\r\ncentury the homes of free thought. Here the most eminent men have spent\r\ntheir lives, not in retailing traditional knowledge, as at school, but in\r\nextending the frontiers of science in all directions. Here, in close\r\nintercourse with their teachers, or under their immediate guidance,\r\ngeneration after generation of boys fresh from school have grown up into\r\nmen during the three years of their academic life. Here, for the first\r\ntime, each man has been encouraged to dare to be himself, to follow his\r\nown tastes, to depend on his own judgment, to try the wings of his mind,\r\nand, lo, like young eagles thrown out of their nest, they could fly. Here\r\nthe old knowledge accumulated at school was tested, and new knowledge\r\nacquired straight from the fountain-head. Here knowledge ceased to be a\r\nmere burden, and became a power invigorating the whole mind, like snow\r\nwhich during winter lies cold and heavy on the meadows, but when it is\r\ntouched by the sun of spring melts away, and fertilizes the ground for a\r\nrich harvest.\r\n\r\nThat was the original purpose of the Universities; and the more they\r\ncontinue to fulfil that purpose, the more will they secure to us that real\r\nfreedom from tradition, from custom, from mere opinion and superstition,\r\nwhich can be gained by independent study only; the more will they foster\r\nthat “human development in its richest diversity” which Mill, like\r\nHumboldt, considered as the highest object of all society.\r\n\r\nSuch academic teaching need not be confined to the old Universities. There\r\nis many a great University that sprang from smaller beginnings than your\r\nMidland Institute. Nor is it necessary, in order to secure the real\r\nbenefits of academic teaching, to have all the paraphernalia of a\r\nUniversity, its colleges and fellowships, its caps and gowns. What is\r\nreally wanted is the presence of men who, having done good work in their\r\nlife, are willing to teach others how to work for themselves, how to think\r\nfor themselves, how to judge for themselves. That is the true academic\r\nstage in every man’s life, when he learns to work, not to please others,\r\nbe they schoolmasters or examiners, but to please himself, when he works\r\nfrom sheer love of work, and for the highest of all purposes, the quest of\r\ntruth. Those only who have passed through that stage know the real\r\nblessings of work. To the world at large they may seem mere drudges—but\r\nthe world does not know the triumphant joy with which the true\r\nmountaineer, high above clouds and mountain walls that once seemed\r\nunsurpassable, drinks in the fresh air of the High Alps, and away from the\r\nfumes, the dust, and the noises of the city, revels alone, in freedom of\r\nthought, in freedom of feeling, and in the freedom of the highest faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PHILOSOPHY OF MYTHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n          A Lecture Delivered At The Royal Institution In 1871.\r\n\r\nWhat can be in our days the interest of mythology? What is it to us that\r\nKronos was the son of Uranos and Gaia, and that he swallowed his children,\r\nHestia, Demeter, Hera, Pluton, and Poseidon, as soon as they were born?\r\nWhat have we to do with the stories of Rhea, the wife of Kronos, who, in\r\norder to save her youngest son from being swallowed by his father, gave\r\nher husband a stone to swallow instead? And why should we be asked to\r\nadmire the exploits of this youngest son, who, when he had grown up, made\r\nhis father drink a draught, and thus helped to deliver the stone and his\r\nfive brothers and sisters from their paternal prison? What shall we think\r\nif we read in the most admired of classic poets that these escaped\r\nprisoners became afterwards the great gods of Greece, gods believed in by\r\nHomer, worshipped by Sokrates, immortalized by Pheidias? Why should we\r\nlisten to such horrors as that Tantalos killed his own son, boiled him,\r\nand placed him before the gods to eat? or that the gods collected his\r\nlimbs, threw them into a cauldron, and thus restored Pelops to life,\r\n_minus_, however, his shoulder, which Demeter had eaten in a fit of\r\nabsence, and which had therefore to be replaced by a shoulder made of\r\nivory?\r\n\r\nCan we imagine anything more silly, more savage, more senseless, anything\r\nmore unworthy to engage our thoughts, even for a single moment? We may\r\npity our children that, in order to know how to construe and understand\r\nthe master-works of Homer and Virgil, they have to fill their memory with\r\nsuch idle tales; but we might justly suppose that men who have serious\r\nwork to do in this world would banish such subjects forever from their\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, how strange, from the very childhood of philosophy, from the\r\nfirst faintly-whispered Why? to our own time of matured thought and\r\nfearless inquiry, mythology has been the ever-recurrent subject of anxious\r\nwonder and careful study. The ancient philosophers, who could pass by the\r\npetrified shells on mountain-tops and the fossil trees buried in their\r\nquarries without ever asking the question how they came to be there, or\r\nwhat they signified, were ever ready with doubts and surmises when they\r\ncame to listen to ancient stories of their gods and heroes. And, more\r\ncurious still, even modern philosophers cannot resist the attraction of\r\nthese ancient problems. That stream of philosophic thought which,\r\nspringing from Descartes (1596-1650), rolled on through the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries in two beds—the _idealistic_, marked by the names\r\nof Malebranche (1638-1715), Spinoza (1632-1677), and Leibniz (1646-1716);\r\nand the _sensualistic_, marked by the names of Locke (1632-1704), David\r\nHume (1711-1776), and Condillac (1715-1780), till the two arms united\r\nagain in Kant (1724-1804), and the full stream was carried on by Schelling\r\n(1775-1854), and Hegel (1770-1831),—this stream of modern philosophic\r\nthought has ended where ancient philosophy began—in a Philosophy of\r\nMythology, which, as you know, forms the most important part of\r\nSchelling’s final system, of what he called himself his _Positive\r\nPhilosophy_, given to the world after the death of that great thinker and\r\npoet, in the year 1854.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that Schelling and Aristotle looked upon mythology in\r\nthe same light, or that they found in it exactly the same problems; yet\r\nthere is this common feature in all who have thought or written on\r\nmythology, that they look upon it as something which, whatever it may\r\nmean, does certainly not mean what it seems to mean; as something that\r\nrequires an explanation, whether it be a system of religion, or a phase in\r\nthe development of the human mind, or an inevitable catastrophe in the\r\nlife of language.\r\n\r\nAccording to some, mythology is history changed into fable; according to\r\nothers, fable changed into history. Some discover in it the precepts of\r\nmoral philosophy enunciated in the poetical language of antiquity; others\r\nsee in it a picture of the great forms and forces of nature, particularly\r\nthe sun, the moon, and the stars, the changes of day and night, the\r\nsuccession of the seasons, the return of the years—all this reflected by\r\nthe vivid imagination of ancient poets and sages.\r\n\r\nEpicharmos, for instance, the pupil of Pythagoras, declared that the gods\r\nof Greece were not what, from the poems of Homer, we might suppose them to\r\nbe—personal beings, endowed with superhuman powers, but liable to many of\r\nthe passions and frailties of human nature. He maintained that these gods\r\nwere really the Wind, the Water, the Earth, the Sun, the Fire, and the\r\nStars. Not long after his time, another philosopher, Empedokles, holding\r\nthat the whole of nature consisted in the mixture and separation of the\r\nfour elements, declared that Zeus was the element of Fire, Here the\r\nelement of Air, Aidoneus or Pluton the element of Earth, and Nestis the\r\nelement of Water. In fact, whatever the free thinkers of Greece discovered\r\nsuccessively as the first principles of Being and Thought, whether the air\r\nof Anaximenes, or the fire of Herakleitos, or the Nous or Mind of\r\nAnaxagoras, was readily identified with Zeus and the other divine persons\r\nof Olympian mythology. Metrodoros, the contemporary of Anaxagoras, went\r\neven farther. While Anaxagoras would have been satisfied with looking upon\r\nZeus as but another name of his Nous, the highest intellect, the mover,\r\nthe disposer, the governor of all things, Metrodoros resolved not only the\r\npersons of Zeus, Here, and Athene, but likewise those of human kings and\r\nheroes—such as Agamemnon, Achilles, and Hektor—into various combinations\r\nand physical agencies, and treated the adventures ascribed to them as\r\nnatural facts hidden under a thin veil of allegory.\r\n\r\nSokrates, it is well known, looked upon such attempts at explaining all\r\nfables allegorically as too arduous and unprofitable: yet he, too, as well\r\nas Plato, pointed frequently to what they called the _hypónoia_, the\r\nunder-current, or, if I may say so, the under-meaning of ancient\r\nmythology.\r\n\r\nAristotle speaks more explicitly:—\r\n\r\n“It has been handed down,” he says, “by early and very ancient people, and\r\nleft to those who came after, in the form of myths, that these (the first\r\nprinciples of the world) are the gods, and that the divine embraces the\r\nwhole of nature. The rest has been added mythically, in order to persuade\r\nthe many, and in order to be used in support of laws and other interests.\r\nThus they say that the gods have a human form, and that they are like to\r\nsome of the other living beings, and other things consequent on this, and\r\nsimilar to what has been said. If one separated out of these fables, and\r\ntook only that first point, namely, that they believed the first essences\r\nto be gods, one would think that it had been divinely said, and that while\r\nevery art and every philosophy was probably invented ever so many times\r\nand lost again, these opinions had, like fragments of them, been preserved\r\nuntil now. So far only is the opinion of our fathers, and that received\r\nfrom our first ancestors, clear to us.”\r\n\r\nI have quoted the opinions of these Greek philosophers, to which many more\r\nmight have been added, partly in order to show how many of the most\r\ndistinguished minds of ancient Greece agreed in demanding an\r\ninterpretation, whether physical or metaphysical, of Greek mythology,\r\npartly in order to satisfy those classical scholars, who, forgetful of\r\ntheir own classics, forgetful of their own Plato and Aristotle, seem to\r\nimagine that the idea of seeing in the gods and heroes of Greece anything\r\nbeyond what they appear to be in the songs of Homer, was a mere fancy and\r\ninvention of the students of Comparative Mythology.\r\n\r\nThere were, no doubt, Greeks, and eminent Greeks too, who took the legends\r\nof their gods and heroes in their literal sense. But what do these say of\r\nHomer and Hesiod? Xenophanes, the contemporary of Pythagoras, holds Homer\r\nand Hesiod responsible for the popular superstitions of Greece. In this he\r\nagrees with Herodotus, when he declares that these two poets made the\r\ntheogony for the Greeks, and gave to the gods their names, and assigned to\r\nthem their honors and their arts, and described their appearances. But he\r\nthen continues in a very different strain from the pious historian.(20)\r\n“Homer,” he says,(21) “and Hesiod ascribed to the gods whatever is\r\ndisgraceful and scandalous among men, yea, they declared that the gods had\r\ncommitted nearly all unlawful acts, such as theft, adultery, and fraud.”\r\n“Men seem to have created their gods, and to have given to them their own\r\nmind, voice, and figure. The Ethiopians made their gods black and\r\nflat-nosed; the Thracians red-haired and blue-eyed.” This was spoken about\r\n500 B. C. Herakleitos, about 460 B. C., one of the boldest thinkers of\r\nancient Greece, declared that Homer deserved to be ejected from public\r\nassemblies and flogged; and a story is told that Pythagoras (about 540 B.\r\nC.) saw the soul of Homer in Hades, hanging on a tree and surrounded by\r\nserpents, as a punishment for what he had said of the gods. And what can\r\nbe stronger than the condemnation passed on Homer by Plato? I shall read\r\nan extract from the “Republic,” from the excellent translation lately\r\npublished by Professor Jowett:—\r\n\r\n“But what fault do you find with Homer and Hesiod, and the other great\r\nstory-tellers of mankind?”\r\n\r\n“A fault which is most serious,” I said: “the fault of telling a lie, and\r\na bad lie.”\r\n\r\n“But when is this fault committed?”\r\n\r\n“Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and\r\nheroes—like the drawing of a limner which has not the shadow of a likeness\r\nto the truth.”\r\n\r\n“ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but what\r\nare the stories which you mean?’ ”\r\n\r\n“ ‘First of all,’ I said, ‘there was that greatest of all lies in high\r\nplaces, which the poet told about Uranos, and which was an immoral lie\r\ntoo—I mean what Hesiod says that Uranos did, and what Kronos did to him.\r\nThe fact is that the doings of Kronos, and the sufferings which his son\r\ninflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought not to be lightly told\r\nto young and simple persons; if possible, they had better be buried in\r\nsilence. But if there is an absolute necessity for their mention, a very\r\nfew might hear them in a mystery, and then let them sacrifice not a common\r\n(Eleusinian) pig, but some huge and unprocurable victim; this would have\r\nthe effect of very greatly reducing the number of the hearers.’ ”\r\n\r\n“ ‘Why, yes,’ said he, ‘these stories are certainly objectionable.’ ”\r\n\r\n“ ‘Yes, Adeimantos, they are stories not to be narrated in our state; the\r\nyoung man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is\r\nfar from doing anything outrageous, and that he may chastise his father\r\nwhen he does wrong in any manner that he likes, and in this will only be\r\nfollowing the example of the first and greatest of the gods.’ ”\r\n\r\n“ ‘I quite agree with you,’ he said; ‘in my opinion those stories are _not\r\nfit to be repeated_.’ ‘Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard\r\nthe habit of quarrelling as dishonorable, should anything be said of the\r\nwars in heaven, and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one\r\nanother, which are quite untrue. Far be it from us to tell them of the\r\nbattles of the giants, and embroider them on garments; or of all the\r\ninnumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and\r\nrelations. If they would only believe us, we would tell them that\r\nquarrelling is unholy, and that never up to this time has there been any\r\nquarrel between citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin\r\nby telling children, and the same when they grow up. And these are the\r\nsort of fictions which the poets should be required to compose. But the\r\nnarrative of Hephaestos binding Here his mother, or how, on another\r\noccasion, Zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being\r\nbeaten—such tales must not be admitted in our state, whether they are\r\nsupposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. For the young man cannot\r\njudge what is allegorical and what is literal, and anything that he\r\nreceives into his mind at that age is apt to become indelible and\r\nunalterable; and therefore the tales which they first hear should be\r\nmodels of virtuous thoughts.’ ”\r\n\r\nTo those who look upon mythology as an ancient form of religion, such\r\nfreedom of language as is here used by Xenophanes and Plato, must seem\r\nstartling. If the Iliad were really the Bible of the Greeks, as it has not\r\ninfrequently been called, such violent invectives would have been\r\nimpossible. For let us bear in mind that Xenophanes, though he boldly\r\ndenied the existence of all the mythological deities, and declared his\r\nbelief in One God, “neither in form nor in thought like unto mortals,”(22)\r\nwas not therefore considered a heretic. He never suffered for uttering his\r\nhonest convictions: on the contrary, as far as we know, he was honored by\r\nthe people among whom he lived and taught. Nor was Plato ever punished on\r\naccount of his unbelief, and though he, as well as his master, Sokrates,\r\nbecame obnoxious to the dominant party at Athens, this was due to\r\npolitical far more than to theological motives. At all events, Plato, the\r\npupil, the friend, the apologist of Sokrates, was allowed to teach at\r\nAthens to the end of his life, and few men commanded greater respect in\r\nthe best ranks of Greek society.\r\n\r\nBut, although mythology was not religion in our sense of the word, and\r\nalthough the Iliad certainly never enjoyed among Greeks the authority\r\neither of the Bible, or even of the Veda among the Brahmans, or the Zend\r\nAvesta among the Parsis, yet I would not deny altogether that in a certain\r\nsense the mythology of the Greeks belonged to their religion. We must only\r\nbe on our guard, here as everywhere else, against the misleading influence\r\nof words. The word Religion has, like most words, had its history; it has\r\ngrown and changed with each century, and it cannot, therefore, have meant\r\nwith the Greeks and Brahmans what it means with us. Religions have\r\nsometimes been divided into _national_ or _traditional_, as distinguished\r\nfrom _individual_ or _statutable_ religion. The former are, like\r\nlanguages, home-grown, autochthonic, without an historical beginning,\r\ngenerally without any recognized founder, or even an authorized code; the\r\nlatter have been founded by historical persons, generally in antagonism to\r\ntraditional systems, and they always rest on the authority of a written\r\ncode. I do not consider this division as very useful(23) for a scientific\r\nstudy of religion, because in many cases it is extremely difficult, and\r\nsometimes impossible, to draw a sharp line of demarcation, and to\r\ndetermine whether a given religion should be considered as the work of one\r\nman, or as the combined work of those who came before him, who lived with\r\nhim, nay, even of those who came after him. For our present purpose,\r\nhowever, for showing at once the salient difference between what the\r\nGreeks and what we ourselves should mean by Religion, this division is\r\nvery serviceable. The Greek religion was clearly a national and\r\ntraditional religion, and, as such, it shared both the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of this form of religious belief; the Christian religion is\r\nan historical and, to a great extent, an individual religion, and it\r\npossesses the advantage of an authorized code and of a settled system of\r\nfaith. Let it not be supposed, however, that between traditional and\r\nindividual religions the advantages are all on one, the disadvantages on\r\nthe other side. As long as the immemorial religions of the different\r\nbranches of the human race remained in their natural state, and were not\r\npressed into the service of political parties or an ambitious priesthood,\r\nthey allowed great freedom of thought and a healthy growth of real piety,\r\nand they were seldom disgraced by an intolerant or persecuting spirit.\r\nThey were generally either honestly believed, or, as we have just seen,\r\nhonestly attacked, and a high tone of intellectual morality was preserved,\r\nuntainted by hypocrisy, equivocation, or unreasoning dogmatism. The\r\nmarvellous development of philosophy in Greece, particularly in ancient\r\nGreece, was chiefly due, I believe, to the absence of an established\r\nreligion and an influential priesthood; and it is impossible to overrate\r\nthe blessing which the fresh, pure, invigorating, and elevating air of\r\nthat ancient Greek philosophy has conferred on all ages, not excepting our\r\nown. I shudder at the thought of what the world would have been without\r\nPlato and Aristotle, and I tremble at the idea that the youth of the\r\nfuture should ever be deprived of the teaching and the example of these\r\ntrue prophets of the absolute freedom of thought. Unfortunately, we know\r\nbut little of the earliest fathers of Greek philosophy; we have but\r\nfragments, and those not always trustworthy, nor easily intelligible, of\r\nwhat they taught on the highest questions that can stir the heart of man.\r\nWe have been accustomed to call the oracular sayings of men like Thales,\r\nPythagoros, Xenophanes, or Herakleitos, philosophy, but there was in them\r\nas much of religion as in the songs of Homer and Hesiod. Homer and Hesiod\r\nwere great powers, but their poems were not the only feeders of the\r\nreligious life of Greece. The stream of ancient wisdom and philosophy\r\nflowed parallel with the stream of legend and poetry; and both were meant\r\nto support the religious cravings of the soul. We have only to attend\r\nwithout prejudice to the utterances of these ancient prophets, such as\r\nXenophanes and Herakleitos, in order to convince ourselves that these men\r\nspoke with authority to the people,(24) that they considered themselves\r\nthe equals of Homer and Hesiod, nay, their betters, and in no way fettered\r\nby the popular legends about gods and goddesses. While modern religions\r\nassume in general a hostile attitude towards philosophy, ancient religions\r\nhave either included philosophy as an integral part, or they have at least\r\ntolerated its growth in the very precincts of their temples.\r\n\r\nAfter we have thus seen what limitations we must place on the meaning of\r\nthe word Religion, if we call mythology the religion of the ancient world,\r\nwe may now advance another step.\r\n\r\nWe have glanced at the principal interpretations which have been proposed\r\nby the ancients themselves of the original purpose and meaning of\r\nmythology. But there is one question which none, either of the ancient or\r\nof the modern interpreters of mythology, has answered, or even asked, and\r\non which, nevertheless, the whole problem of mythology seems to turn. If\r\nmythology is history changed into fable, why was it so changed? If it is\r\nfable represented as history, why were such fables invented? If it\r\ncontains precepts of moral philosophy, whence their immoral disguise? If\r\nit is a picture of the great forms and forces of nature, the same question\r\nstill returns, why were these forms and forces represented as heroes and\r\nheroines, as nymphs and shepherds, as gods and goddesses? It is easy\r\nenough to call the sun a god, or the dawn a goddess, after these\r\npredicates have once been framed. But how were these predicates framed?\r\nHow did people come to know of gods and goddesses, heroes and nymphs, and\r\nwhat meaning did they originally connect with these terms? In fact, the\r\nreal question which a philosophy of mythology has to answer is this—Is the\r\nwhole of mythology an invention, the fanciful poetry of a Homer or Hesiod,\r\nor is it a growth? Or, to speak more definitely, Was mythology a mere\r\naccident, or was it inevitable? Was it only a false step, or was it a step\r\nthat could not have been left out in the historical progress of the human\r\nmind?\r\n\r\nThe study of the history of language, which is only a part of the study of\r\nthe history of thought, has enabled us to give a decisive answer to this\r\nquestion. Mythology is inevitable, it is natural, it is an inherent\r\nnecessity of language, if we recognize in language the outward form and\r\nmanifestation of thought: it is, in fact, the dark shadow which language\r\nthrows on thought, and which can never disappear till language becomes\r\naltogether commensurate with thought, which it never will. Mythology, no\r\ndoubt, breaks out more fiercely during the early periods of the history of\r\nhuman thought, but it never disappears altogether. Depend upon it, there\r\nis mythology now as there was in the time of Homer, only we do not\r\nperceive it, because we ourselves live in the very shadow of it, and\r\nbecause we all shrink from the full meridian light of truth. We are ready\r\nenough to see that if the ancients called their kings and heroes\r\nΔιογενεῖς, sprung of Zeus, that expression, intended originally to convey\r\nthe highest praise which man can bestow on man, was apt to lapse into\r\nmythology. We easily perceive how such a conception, compatible in its\r\norigin with the highest reverence for the gods, led almost inevitably to\r\nthe growth of fables, which transferred to divine beings the incidents of\r\nhuman paternity and sonship. But we are not so ready to see that it is our\r\nfate, too, to move in allegories which illustrate things intellectual by\r\nvisions exhibited to the fancy. In our religion, too, the conceptions of\r\npaternity and sonship have not always been free from all that is human,\r\nnor are we always aware that nearly every note that belongs to human\r\npaternity and sonship must be taken out of these terms, before they can be\r\npronounced safe against mythological infection. Papal decisions on\r\nimmaculate conception are of no avail against that mythology. The mind\r\nmust become immaculate and rise superior to itself; or it must close its\r\neyes and shut its lips in the presence of the Divine.\r\n\r\nIf then we want to understand mythology, in the ordinary and restricted\r\nsense of the word, we must discover the larger circle of mental phenomena\r\nto which it belongs. Greek mythology, is but a small segment of mythology;\r\nthe religious mythologies of all the races of mankind are again but a\r\nsmall segment of mythology. Mythology, in the highest sense, is the power\r\nexercised by language on thought in every possible sphere of mental\r\nactivity; and I do not hesitate to call the whole history of philosophy,\r\nfrom Thales down to Hegel, an uninterrupted battle against mythology, a\r\nconstant protest of thought against language. This will require some\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nEver since the time of Wilhelm von Humboldt, all who have seriously\r\ngrappled with the highest problems of the Science of Language have come to\r\nthe conviction that thought and language are inseparable, that language is\r\nas impossible without thought as thought is without language; that they\r\nstand to each other somewhat like soul and body, like power and function,\r\nlike substance and form. The objections which have been raised against\r\nthis view arise generally from a mere misunderstanding. If we speak of\r\nlanguage as the outward realization of thought, we do not mean language as\r\ndeposited in a dictionary, or sketched in a grammar; we mean language as\r\nan act, language as being spoken, language as living and dying with every\r\nword that is uttered. We might perhaps call this speech, as distinguished\r\nfrom language.\r\n\r\nSecondly, though if we speak of language, we mean chiefly phonetic\r\narticulate language, we do not exclude the less perfect symbols of\r\nthought, such as gestures, signs, or pictures. They, too, are language in\r\na certain sense, and they must be included in language before we are\r\njustified in saying that discursive thought can be realized in language\r\nonly. One instance will make this clear. We hold that we cannot think\r\nwithout language. But can we not count without language? We certainly can.\r\nWe can form the conception of _three_ without any spoken word, by simply\r\nholding up three fingers. In the same manner, the hand might stand for\r\nfive, both hands for ten, hands and feet for twenty.(25) This is how\r\npeople who possessed no organs of speech would speak; this is how the deaf\r\nand dumb _do_ speak. Three fingers are as good as three strokes, three\r\nstrokes are as good as three clicks of the tongue, three clicks of the\r\ntongue are as good as the sound _three_, or _trois_, or _drei_, or\r\n_shalosh_ in Hebrew, or _san_ in Chinese. All these are signs, more or\r\nless perfect, but being signs, they fall under the category of language;\r\nand all we maintain is, that without some kind of sign, discursive thought\r\nis impossible, and that in that sense, language, or λόγος, is the only\r\npossible realization of human thought.\r\n\r\nAnother very common misunderstanding is this: people imagine that, if it\r\nbe impossible to think, except in language, language and thought must be\r\none and the same thing. But a true philosophy of language leads to the\r\nvery opposite result. Every philosopher would say that matter cannot exist\r\nwithout form, nor form without matter, but no philosopher would say that\r\ntherefore it is impossible to distinguish between form and matter. In the\r\nsame way, though we maintain that thought cannot exist without language\r\nnor language without thought, we do distinguish between thought and\r\nlanguage, between the inward and the outward λόγος, between the substance\r\nand the form. Nay, we go a step beyond. We admit that language necessarily\r\nreacts on thought, and we see in this reaction, in this refraction of the\r\nrays of language, the real solution of the old riddle of mythology.\r\n\r\nYou will now see why these somewhat abstruse disquisitions were necessary\r\nfor our immediate purpose, and I can promise those who have hitherto\r\nfollowed me on this rather barren and rugged track, that they will now be\r\nable to rest, and command, from the point of view which we have reached,\r\nthe whole panorama of the mythology of the human mind.\r\n\r\nWe saw just now that the names of numbers may most easily be replaced by\r\nsigns. Numbers are simple analytical conceptions, and for that very reason\r\nthey are not liable to mythology: name and conception being here\r\ncommensurate, no misunderstanding is possible. But as soon as we leave\r\nthis department of thought, mythology begins. I shall try by at least one\r\nexample to show how mythology not only pervades the sphere of religion or\r\nreligious tradition, but infects more or less the whole realm of thought.\r\n\r\nWhen man wished for the first time to grasp and express a distinction\r\nbetween the body and something else within him distinct from the body, an\r\neasy name that suggested itself was _breath_. The breath seemed something\r\nimmaterial and almost invisible, and it was connected with the life that\r\npervaded the body, for as soon as the breath ceased, the life of the body\r\nbecame extinct. Hence the Greek name ψυχή,(26) which originally meant\r\nbreath, was chosen to express at first the principle of life, as\r\ndistinguished from the decaying body, afterwards the incorporeal, the\r\nimmaterial, the undecaying, the immortal part of man—his soul, his mind,\r\nhis Self. All this was very natural. When a person dies, we too say that\r\nhe has given up the ghost, and ghost, too, meant originally spirit, and\r\nspirit meant breath.\r\n\r\nA very instructive analogous case is quoted by Mr. E. B. Tylor from a\r\ncompendium of the theology of the Indians of Nicaragua, the record of\r\nquestion and answer in an inquest held by Father Francisco de Bobadilla in\r\nthe early days of the Spanish conquest. Asked, among other things,\r\nconcerning death, the Indians said: “Those who die in their houses go\r\nunderground, but those who are killed in war go to serve the gods\r\n(_teotes_). When men die, there comes forth from their mouth something\r\nwhich resembles a person, and is called _julio_ (Aztec _yuli_, ‘to live’).\r\nThis being is like a person, but does not die, and the corpse remains\r\nhere.” The Spanish ecclesiastics inquired whether those who go on high\r\nkeep the same body, features, and limbs as here below; to which the\r\nIndians answered, “No, there is only the heart.” “But,” said the\r\nSpaniards, “as the hearts are torn out” (they meant in the case of\r\nwarriors who fell into the hands of the enemy), “what happens then?”\r\nHereupon the Indians replied: “It is not precisely the heart, but that\r\nwhich is in them, and makes them live, and which quits the body when they\r\ndie;” and again they said, “It is not their heart which goes up on high,\r\nbut that which makes them live, that is, the breath coming out from their\r\nmouth, which is called _julio_.” “Then,” asked the Spaniards, “does this\r\nheart, _julio_, or soul, die with the body?” “When the deceased has lived\r\nwell,” replied the Indians, “the _julio_ goes up on high with our gods;\r\nbut when he has lived ill, the _julio_ perishes with the body, and there\r\nis an end of it.”\r\n\r\nThe Greeks expressed the same idea by saying that the ψυχή had left the\r\nbody,(27) had fled through the mouth, or even through a bleeding\r\nwound,(28) and had gone into Hades, which meant literally no more than the\r\nplace of the Invisible (Ἁίδης). That the breath had become invisible was\r\nmatter of fact; that it had gone to the house of Hades, was mythology\r\nspringing spontaneously from the fertile soil of language.\r\n\r\nThe primitive mythology was by no means necessarily religious. In the very\r\ncase which we have chosen, philosophical mythology sprang up by the side\r\nof religious mythology. The religious mythology consisted in speaking of\r\nthe spirits of the departed as ghosts, as mere breath and air, as\r\nfluttering about the gates of Hades, or ferried across the Styx in the\r\nboat of Charon.(29)\r\n\r\nThe philosophical mythology, however, that sprang from this name was much\r\nmore important. We saw that _Psyche_, meaning originally the breathing of\r\nthe body, was gradually used in the sense of vital breath, and as\r\nsomething independent of the body; and that at last, when it had assumed\r\nthe meaning of the immortal part of man, it retained that character of\r\nsomething independent of the body, thus giving rise to the conception of a\r\nsoul, not only as a being without a body, but in its very nature opposed\r\nto body. As soon as that opposition had been established in language and\r\nthought, philosophy began its work in order to explain how two such\r\nheterogeneous powers could act on each other—how the soul could influence\r\nthe body, and how the body could determine the soul. Spiritualistic and\r\nmaterialistic systems of philosophy arose, and all this in order to remove\r\na self-created difficulty, in order to join together again what language\r\nhad severed, the living body and the living soul. The question whether\r\nthere is a soul or spirit, whether there is in man something different\r\nfrom the mere body, is not at all affected by this mythological\r\nphraseology. We certainly can distinguish between body and soul, but as\r\nlong as we keep within the limits of human knowledge, we have no right to\r\nspeak of the living soul as a breath, or of spirits and ghosts as\r\nfluttering about like birds or fairies. The poet of the nineteenth century\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The spirit does but mean the breath,\r\n    I know no more.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the same thought was expressed by Cicero two thousand years ago:\r\n“Whether the soul is air or fire, I do not know.” As men, we only know of\r\nembodied spirits, however ethereal their bodies may be conceived to be,\r\nbut of spirits, separate from body, without form or frame, we know as\r\nlittle as we know of thought without language, or of the Dawn as a\r\ngoddess, or of the Night as the mother of the Day.\r\n\r\nThough breath, or spirit, or ghost are the most common names that were\r\nassigned through the metaphorical nature of language to the vital, and\r\nafterwards to the intellectual, principle in man, they were by no means\r\nthe only possible names. We speak, for instance, of the _shades_ of the\r\ndeparted, which meant originally their shadows. Those who first introduced\r\nthis expression—and we find it in the most distant parts of the\r\nworld(30)—evidently took the shadow as the nearest approach to what they\r\nwished to express; something that should be incorporeal, yet closely\r\nconnected with the body. The Greek εἰδῶλον, too, is not much more than the\r\nshadow, while the Latin _manes_ meant probably in the beginning no more\r\nthan the Little Ones, the Small Folk.(31) But the curious part, as showing\r\nagain the influence of language on thought, an influence more powerful\r\neven than the evidence of the senses, is this, that people who speak of\r\nthe life or soul as the shadow of the body, have brought themselves to\r\nbelieve that a dead body casts no shadow, because the shadow has departed\r\nfrom it; that it becomes, in fact, a kind of Peter Schlemihl.(32)\r\n\r\nLet us now return to mythology in the narrower sense of the word. One of\r\nthe earliest objects that would strike and stir the mind of man, and for\r\nwhich a sign or a name would soon be wanted, is surely the Sun. It is very\r\nhard for us to realize the feelings with which the first dwellers on the\r\nearth looked upon the sun, or to understand fully what they meant by a\r\nmorning prayer, or a morning sacrifice. Perhaps there are few people here\r\npresent who have watched a sunrise more than once or twice in their lives;\r\nfew people who have ever known the true meaning of a morning prayer, or a\r\nmorning sacrifice. But think of man at the very dawn of time: forget for a\r\nmoment, if you can, after having read the fascinating pages of Mr. Darwin,\r\nforget what man is supposed to have been before he was man; forget it,\r\nbecause it does not concern us here whether his bodily form and frame were\r\ndeveloped once for all in the mind of a Creator, or gradually in the\r\ncreation itself, which from the first monad or protoplasm to the last of\r\nthe primates, or man, is not, I suppose, to be looked on as altogether\r\ncauseless, meaningless, purposeless; think of him only as man (and man\r\nmeans the thinker), with his mind yet lying fallow, though full of\r\ngerms—germs of which I hold as strongly as ever no trace has ever, no\r\ntrace will ever, be discovered anywhere but in man; think of the Sun\r\nawakening the eyes of man from sleep, and his mind from slumber! Was not\r\nthe Sunrise to him the first wonder, the first beginning of all\r\nreflection, all thought, all philosophy? was it not to him the first\r\nrevelation, the first beginning of all trust, of all religion? To us that\r\nwonder of wonders has ceased to exist, and few men now would even venture\r\nto speak of the sun as Sir John Herschel has spoken, calling him “the\r\nAlmoner of the Almighty, the delegated dispenser to us of light and\r\nwarmth, as well as the centre of attraction, and as such, the immediate\r\nsource of all our comforts, and, indeed, of the very possibility of our\r\nexistence on earth.”(33)\r\n\r\nMan is a creature of habit, and wherever we can watch him, we find that\r\nbefore a few generations have passed he has lost the power of admiring\r\nwhat is regular, and that he can see signs and wonders only in what is\r\nirregular. Few nations only have preserved in their ancient poetry some\r\nremnants of the natural awe with which the earliest dwellers on the earth\r\nsaw that brilliant being slowly rising from out the darkness of the night,\r\nraising itself by its own might higher and higher, till it stood\r\ntriumphant on the arch of heaven, and then descended and sank down in its\r\nfiery glory into the dark abyss of the heaving and hissing sea. In the\r\nhymns of the Veda the poet still wonders whether the sun will rise again;\r\nhe asks how he can climb the vault of heaven? why he does not fall back?\r\nwhy there is no dust on his path? And when the rays of the morning rouse\r\nhim from sleep and call him back to new life; when he sees the sun, as he\r\nsays, stretching out his golden arms to bless the world and rescue it from\r\nthe terrors of darkness, he exclaims, “Arise, our life, our spirit has\r\ncome back! the darkness is gone, the light approaches!”\r\n\r\nFor so prominent an object in the primeval picture-gallery of the human\r\nmind, a sign or a name must have been wanted at a very early period. But\r\nhow was this to be achieved? As a mere sign, a circle would have been\r\nsufficient, such as we find in the hieroglyphics of Egypt, in the graphic\r\nsystem of China, or even in our own astronomical tables. If such a sign\r\nwas fixed upon, we have a beginning of language in the widest sense of the\r\nword, for we have brought the Sun under the general concept of roundness,\r\nand we have found a sign for this concept which is made up of a large\r\nnumber of single sensuous impressions. With such definite signs mythology\r\nhas little chance; yet the mere fact that the sun was represented as a\r\ncircle would favor the idea that the sun was round; or, as ancient people,\r\nwho had no adjective as yet for round or _rotundus_,(34) would say, that\r\nthe sun was a wheel, a _rota_. If, on the contrary, the round sign\r\nreminded the people of an eye, then the sign of the sun would soon become\r\nthe eye of heaven, and germs of mythology would spring up even from the\r\nbarren soil of such hieroglyphic language.\r\n\r\nBut now, suppose that a real name was wanted for the sun, how could that\r\nbe achieved?\r\n\r\nWe know that all words are derived from roots, that these roots express\r\ngeneral concepts, and that, with few exceptions, every name is founded on\r\na general concept under which the object that has to be named can be\r\nranged. How these roots came to be, is a question into which we need not\r\nenter at present. Their origin and growth form a problem of psychology\r\nrather than of philology, and each science must keep within its proper\r\nbounds. If a name was wanted for snow, the early framers of language\r\nsingled out one of the general predicates of snow, its whiteness, its\r\ncoldness, or its liquidity, and called the snow the white, the cold, or\r\nthe liquid, by means of roots conveying the general idea of whiteness,\r\ncoldness, or liquidity. Not only Nix, nivis, but Niobe(35) too, was a name\r\nof the snow, and meant the melting; the death of her beautiful children by\r\nthe arrows of Apollon and Artemis represents the destruction of winter by\r\nthe rays of the sun. If the sun itself was to be named, it might be called\r\nthe brilliant, the awakener, the runner, the ruler, the father, the giver\r\nof warmth, of fertility, of life, the scorcher, the destroyer, the\r\nmessenger of death, and many other names; but there was no possibility of\r\nnaming it, except by laying hold of one of its characteristic features,\r\nand expressing that feature by means of one of the conceptual or\r\npredicative roots.\r\n\r\nLet us trace the history of at least one of these names. Before the Aryan\r\nnations separated, before there was a Latin, a Greek, or a Sanskrit\r\nlanguage, there existed a root _svar_ or _sval_, which meant to beam, to\r\nglitter, to warm. It exists in Greek, σέλας, splendor; σελήνη, moon; in\r\nAnglo-Saxon, as _swélan_, to burn, to sweal; in modern German, _schwül_,\r\noppressively hot. From it we have in Sanskrit the noun _svar_, meaning\r\nsometimes the sky, sometimes the sun; and exactly the same word has been\r\npreserved in Latin, as _sol_; in Gothic as _sauil_; in Anglo-Saxon, as\r\n_sol_. A secondary form of _svar_ is the Sanskrit _sûrya_ for _svârya_,\r\nthe sun, which is the same word as the Greek ἥλιος.\r\n\r\nAll these names were originally mere predicates; they meant bright,\r\nbrilliant, warm. But as soon as the name _svar_ or _sûrya_ was formed, it\r\nbecame, through the irresistible influence of language, the name, not only\r\nof a living, but of a male being. Every noun in Sanskrit must be either a\r\nmasculine or a feminine (for the neuter gender was originally confined to\r\nthe nominative case), and as _sûrya_ had been formed as a masculine,\r\nlanguage stamped it once for all as the sign of a male being, as much as\r\nif it had been the name of a warrior or a king. In other languages where\r\nthe name for sun is a feminine, and the sun is accordingly conceived as a\r\nwoman, as a queen, as the bride of the moon, the whole mythology of the\r\nlove-making of the heavenly bodies is changed.\r\n\r\nYou may say that all this shows, not so much the influence of language on\r\nthought, as of thought on language; and that the sexual character of all\r\nwords reflects only the peculiarities of a child’s mind, which can\r\nconceive of nothing except as living, as male or female. If a child hurts\r\nitself against a chair, it beats and scolds the chair. The chair is looked\r\nupon not as _it_, but as _he_; it is the naughty chair, quite as much as a\r\nboy is a naughty boy. There is some truth in this, but it only serves to\r\nconfirm the right view of the influence of language on thought; for this\r\ntendency, though in its origin intentional, and therefore the result of\r\nthought, became soon a mere rule of tradition in language, and it then\r\nreacted on the mind with irresistible power. As soon, in fact, as _sûryas_\r\nor ἥλιος appears as a masculine, we are in the very thick of mythology. We\r\nhave not yet arrived at Helios as a god—that is a much later stage of\r\nthought, which we might describe almost in the words of Plato at the\r\nbeginning of the seventh book of the “Republic,” “And after this, he will\r\nreason that the sun is he who gives the seasons and the years, and is the\r\nguardian of all that is in the visible world, and in a certain way the\r\ncause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to\r\nbehold.” We have not yet advanced so far, but we have reached at least the\r\nfirst germs of a myth. In the Homeric hymn to Helios, Helios is not yet\r\ncalled an immortal, but only ἐπιείκελος ἀθανάτοισι, like unto immortals,\r\nyet he is called the child of Euryphaessa, the son of Hyperion, the\r\ngrandson of Uranos and Gæa.(36)\r\n\r\nAll this is mythology; it is ancient language going beyond its first\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nNor is there much difficulty in interpreting this myth. Helios, the sun,\r\nis called the son of Hyperīon, sometimes Hyperīon himself. This name\r\nHyperīon is derived from the preposition ὑπέρ, the Latin _super_, which\r\nmeans above. It is derived by means of the suffix -ιων, which originally\r\nwas not a patronymic, but simply expressed belonging to. So if Helios was\r\ncalled Hyperion, this simply meant he who dwells on high, and corresponds\r\nto Latin _Summanus_ or _Superior_, or _Excelsior_. If, on the contrary,\r\nHelios is called Hyperionides, this, too, which meant originally no more\r\nthan he who comes from, or belongs to those who dwell on high,(37) led to\r\nthe myth that he was the descendant of Hyperion; so that in this case, as\r\nin the case of Zeus Kronīon, the son really led to the conception of his\r\nfather. Zeus Kronīon meant originally no more than Zeus the eternal, the\r\ngod of ages, the ancient of days; but -ιων becoming usual as a patronymic\r\nsuffix, Kronion was supposed to mean the son of Kronos. Kronos, the\r\nfather, was created in order to account for the existence of the name\r\nKronion. If Hyperīon is called the son of Euryphaessa, the wide-shining,\r\nthis requires no commentary; for even at present a poet might say that the\r\nsun is born of the wide-shining dawn. You see the spontaneous generation\r\nof mythology with every new name that is formed. As not only the sun, but\r\nalso the moon and the dawn could be called dwellers on high, they, too,\r\ntook the name of Hyperionis or Hyperionides; and hence Homer called\r\nSelene, the Moon, and Eos, the Dawn, sisters of Helios, and daughters of\r\nHyperion and Euryphaessa, the Dawn doing service twice, both as mother,\r\nEuryphaessa, and as daughter, Eos. Nay, according to Homer, Euryphaessa,\r\nthe Dawn, is not only the wife, but also the sister of Helios. All this is\r\nperfectly intelligible, if we watch the growth of language and mythology;\r\nbut it leads, of course, to the most tragic catastrophes as soon as it is\r\nall taken in a literal sense.\r\n\r\nHelios is called ἀκάμας, the never-tiring; πανδερκής, the all-seeing;\r\nφαέθων, the shining; and also φοῖβος, the brilliant. This last epithet\r\nφοῖβος has grown into an independent deity Phœbus, and it is particularly\r\nknown as a name of Apollon, Phoibos Apollon; thus showing what is also\r\nknown from other sources, that in Apollo, too, we have one of the many\r\nmythic disguises of the sun.\r\n\r\nSo far all is clear, because all the names which we have to deal with are\r\nintelligible, or, at all events, yield to the softest etymological\r\npressure. But now if we hear the story of Phoibos Apollon falling in love\r\nwith Daphne, and Daphne praying to her mother, the Earth, to save her from\r\nPhoibos; and if we read how either the earth received her in her lap, and\r\nthen a laurel tree sprang up where she had disappeared, or how she herself\r\nwas changed into a laurel tree, what shall we think of this? It is a mere\r\nstory, it might be said, and why should there be any meaning in it? My\r\nanswer is, because people do not tell such stories of their gods and\r\nheroes, unless there is some sense in them. Besides, if Phoibos means the\r\nsun, why should not Daphne have a meaning too? Before, therefore, we can\r\ndecide whether the story of Phoibos and Daphne is a mere invention, we\r\nmust try to find out what can have been the meaning of the word Daphne.\r\n\r\nIn Greek it means a laurel,(38) and this would explain the purely Greek\r\nlegend that Daphne was changed into a laurel tree. But who was Daphne? In\r\norder to answer this question, we must have recourse to etymology, or, in\r\nother words, we must examine the history of the word. Etymology, as you\r\nknow, is no longer what it used to be; and though there may still be a\r\nclassical scholar here and there who crosses himself at the idea of a\r\nGreek word being explained by a reference to Sanskrit, we naturally look\r\nto Sanskrit as the master-key to many a lock which no Greek key will open.\r\nNow Daphne, as I have shown, can be traced back to Sanskrit Ahanâ, and\r\nAhanâ in Sanskrit means the dawn. As soon as we know this, everything\r\nbecomes clear. The story of Phoibos and Daphne is no more than a\r\ndescription of what every one may see every day; first, the appearance of\r\nthe Dawn in the eastern sky, then the rising of the Sun as if hurrying\r\nafter his bride, then the gradual fading away of the bright Dawn at the\r\ntouch of the fiery rays of the sun, and at last her death or disappearance\r\nin the lap of her mother, the Earth. All this seems to me as clear as\r\ndaylight, and the only objection that could be raised against this reading\r\nof the ancient myth would be, if it could be proved, that Ahanâ does not\r\nmean Dawn, and that Daphne cannot be traced back to Ahanâ, or that\r\n_Helios_ does not mean the Sun.\r\n\r\nI know there is another objection, but it seems to me so groundless as\r\nhardly to deserve an answer. Why, it is asked, should the ancient nations\r\nhave told these endless stories about the Sun and the Dawn, and why should\r\nthey have preserved them in their mythology? We might as well ask why the\r\nancient nations should have invented so many irregular verbs, and why they\r\nshould have preserved them in their grammar. A fact does not cease to be a\r\nfact, because we cannot at once explain it. As far as our knowledge goes\r\nat present, we are justified in stating that the Aryan nations preserved\r\nnot only their grammatical structure, and a large portion of their\r\ndictionary, from the time which preceded their separation, but that they\r\nlikewise retained the names of some of their deities, some legends about\r\ntheir gods, some popular sayings and proverbs, and in these, it may be,\r\nthe seeds of parables, as part of their common Aryan heirloom. Their\r\nmythological lore fills, in fact, a period in the history of Aryan\r\nthought, half-way between the period of language and the period of\r\nliterature, and it is this discovery which gives to mythology its\r\nimportance in the eyes of the student of the most ancient history and\r\npsychology of mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd do not suppose that the Greeks, or the Hindus, or the Aryan nations in\r\ngeneral, were the only people who possessed such tales. Wherever we look,\r\nin every part of the world, among uncivilized as well as a civilized\r\npeople, we find the same kind of stories, the same traditions, the same\r\nmyths.\r\n\r\nI shall give one story from the extreme North, another from the extreme\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nAmong the Esquimaux of Repulse Bay, on the west side of Hudson’s Bay, on\r\nthe Arctic Circle, Mr. John Rae picked up the following story:—\r\n\r\n“Many years ago, a great Esquimaux Conqueror gained so much power that he\r\nwas able to rise unto the heavens, taking with him on one occasion a\r\nsister, a very beautiful girl, and some fire. He added much fuel to the\r\nfire, and thus formed the Sun. For some time he and his sister lived in\r\ngreat harmony, but after a time he became very cruel, and ill-treated his\r\nsister in many ways. She bore it at first with great patience, until at\r\nlast he threw fire at her, and scorched one side of her face. This\r\nspoiling of her beauty was beyond endurance; she therefore ran away from\r\nhim, and formed the Moon. Her brother then began, and still continues to\r\nchase her; but although he sometimes got near, he has not yet overtaken\r\nher, nor ever will.\r\n\r\n“When it is New Moon, the burnt side of the face is towards us; at Full\r\nMoon it is the reverse.”\r\n\r\nThere are dialectic varieties in the Mythology of the Esquimaux as of the\r\nGreeks and Hindus, and, with a change of gender between Sun and Moon, the\r\nsame story occurs among other tribes in the following form:—\r\n\r\n“There was a girl at a party, and some one told his love for her by\r\nshaking her shoulders, after the manner of the country. She could not see\r\nwho it was in the dark hut, so she smeared her hands with soot, and when\r\nhe came back she blackened his cheek with her hand. When a light was\r\nbrought she saw that it was her brother and fled. He ran after her,\r\nfollowed her, and as she came to the end of the earth, he sprang out into\r\nthe sky. Then she became the sun, and he the moon, and this is why the\r\nmoon is always chasing the sun through the heavens, and why the moon is\r\nsometimes dark as he turns his blackened cheek towards the earth.”(39)\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the South, and here, among the lowest of the low, among the\r\nHottentots, who are despised even by their black neighbors, the Zulus, we\r\nfind the following gem of a fable, beaming with mingled rays of religion\r\nand philosophy:—\r\n\r\n“The Moon, it is said, sent once an insect to men, saying, ‘Go thou to\r\nmen, and tell them, As I die, and dying live, so ye shall also die, and\r\ndying live.’ The insect started with the message, but whilst on his way\r\nwas overtaken by the hare, who asked: ‘On what errand art thou bound?’ The\r\ninsect answered, ‘I am sent by the Moon to men, to tell them that as she\r\ndies and dying lives, they also shall die and dying live.’ The hare said,\r\n‘As thou art an awkward runner, let me go’ (to take the message). With\r\nthese words he ran off, and when he reached men, he said, ‘I am sent by\r\nthe Moon to tell you, As I die, and dying perish, in the same manner ye\r\nalso shall die and come wholly to an end.’ Then the hare returned to the\r\nMoon, and told her what he had said to men. The Moon reproached him\r\nangrily, saying, ‘Darest thou tell the people a thing which I have not\r\nsaid?’ With these words she took up a piece of wood, and struck him on the\r\nnose. Since that day the hare’s nose is slit.”\r\n\r\nOf this story, too, there are various versions and in one of them the end\r\nis as follows:—\r\n\r\n“The hare, having returned to the Moon, was questioned as to the message\r\ndelivered, and the Moon, having heard the true state of the case, became\r\nso enraged with him that she took up a hatchet to split his head; falling\r\nshort, however, of that, the hatchet fell upon the upper lip of the hare,\r\nand cut it severely. Hence it is that we see the ‘hare-lip.’ The hare,\r\nbeing duly incensed at having received such treatment, raised his claws,\r\nand scratched the Moon’s face; and the dark parts which we now see on the\r\nsurface of the Moon are the scars which she received on that\r\noccasion.”(40)\r\n\r\nThe Finns, Lapps, and Esthonians do not seem a very poetical race, yet\r\nthere is poetry even in their smoky huts, poetry surrounded with all the\r\nsplendor of an arctic night, and fragrant with the perfume of moss and\r\nwild flowers. Here is one of their legends:—\r\n\r\n“Wanna Issi had two servants, Koit and Ämmarik, and he gave them a torch\r\nwhich Koit should light every morning, and Ämmarik should extinguish in\r\nthe evening. In order to reward their faithful services, Wanna Issi told\r\nthem they might be man and wife, but they asked Wanna Issi that he would\r\nallow them to remain forever bride and bridegroom. Wanna Issi assented,\r\nand henceforth Koit handed the torch every evening to Ämmarik, and Ämmarik\r\ntook it and extinguished it. Only during four weeks in summer they remain\r\ntogether at midnight; Koit hands the dying torch to Ämmarik, but Ämmarik\r\ndoes not let it die, but lights it again with her breath. Then their hands\r\nare stretched out, and their lips meet, and the blush of the face of\r\nÄmmarik colors the midnight sky.”\r\n\r\nThis myth requires hardly any commentary; yet as long as it is impossible\r\nto explain the names, Wanna Issi, Koit, and Ämmarik, it might be said that\r\nthe story was but a love story, invented by an idle Lapp, or Finn, or\r\nEsthonian. But what if Wanna Issi in Esthonian means the Old Father, and\r\nif Koit means the Dawn? Can we then doubt any longer that Ämmarik(41) must\r\nbe the Gloaming and that their meeting in the summer reflects those summer\r\nevenings when, particularly in the North, the torch of the sun seems never\r\nto die, and when the Gloaming is seen kissing the Dawn?\r\n\r\nI wish I could tell you some more of these stories which have been\r\ngathered from all parts of the world, and which, though they may be\r\npronounced childish and tedious by some critics, seem to me to glitter\r\nwith the brightest dew of nature’s own poetry, and to contain those very\r\ntouches that make us feel akin, not only with Homer or Shakespeare, but\r\neven with Lapps, and Finns, and Kaffirs.\r\n\r\nI cannot resist, however, the temptation of inserting here a poetical\r\nrendering of the story of Koit and Ämmarik, sent to me from the New World,\r\nremarking only that instead of Lapland, Esthonia is really the country\r\nthat may claim the original story.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A LEGEND OF LAPLAND.\r\n\r\n    “Two servants were in Wanna Issi’s pay;\r\n      A blazing torch their care;\r\n    Each morning Koit must light it till its ray\r\n      Flamed through the air;\r\n\r\n    “And every evening Ämmarik’s fair hand\r\n      Must quench the waning light;\r\n    Then over all the weary, waiting land\r\n      Fell the still night.\r\n\r\n    “So passed the time; then Wanna Issi said,\r\n      “For faithful service done,\r\n    Lo, here reward! To-morrow shall ye wed,\r\n      And so be one.”\r\n\r\n    “ ‘Not so,’ said Koit; ‘for sweeter far to me\r\n      The joy that neareth still;\r\n    Then grant us ever fast betrothed to be.”\r\n      They had their will.\r\n\r\n    “And now the blazing lustre to transfer\r\n      Himself, is all his claim;\r\n    Warm from her lover’s hand it comes to her,\r\n      To quench the flame.\r\n\r\n    “Only for four times seven lengthening days,\r\n      At midnight, do they stand\r\n    Together, while Koit gives the dying blaze\r\n      To Ämmarik’s hand.\r\n\r\n    “O wonder then! She lets it not expire,\r\n      But lights it with her breath—\r\n    The breath of love, that, warm with quickening fire,\r\n      Wakes life from death.\r\n\r\n    “Then hands stretch out, and touch, and clasp on high,\r\n      Then lip to lip is pressed,\r\n    And Ämmarik’s blushes tinge the midnight sky\r\n      From east to west.”\r\n\r\n    ANNA C. BRACKETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf people cannot bring themselves to believe in solar and celestial myths\r\namong the Hindus and Greeks, let them study the folk-lore of the Semitic\r\nand Turanian races. I know there is, on the part of some of our most\r\ndistinguished scholars, the same objection against comparing Aryan to\r\nnon-Aryan myths, as there is against any attempt to explain the features\r\nof Sanskrit or Greek by a reference to Finnish or Bask. In one sense that\r\nobjection is well founded, for nothing would create greater confusion than\r\nto ignore the genealogical principle as the only safe one in a scientific\r\nclassification of languages, of myths, and even of customs. We must first\r\nclassify our myths and legends, as we classify our languages and dialects.\r\nWe must first of all endeavor to explain what wants explanation in one\r\nmember of a family by a reference to other members of the same family,\r\nbefore we allow ourselves to glance beyond. But there is in a comparative\r\nstudy of languages and myths not only a philological, but also a\r\nphilosophical, and, more particularly, a psychological interest, and\r\nthough even in this more general study of mankind the frontiers of\r\nlanguage and race ought never to disappear, yet they can no longer be\r\nallowed to narrow or intercept our view. How much the student of Aryan\r\nmythology and ethnology may gain for his own progress by allowing himself\r\na wider survey over the traditions and customs of the whole human race, is\r\nbest known to those who have studied the works of Klemm, Waitz, Bastian,\r\nSir John Lubbock, Mr. Tylor, and Dr. Callaway. What is prehistoric in\r\nlanguage among the Aryan nations, is frequently found as still historic\r\namong Turanian races. The same applies with regard to religions, myths,\r\nlegends, and customs. Among Finns and Lapps, among Zulus and Maoris, among\r\nKhonds and Karens, we sometimes find the most startling analogies to Aryan\r\ntraditions, and we certainly learn, again and again, this one important\r\nlesson, that as in language, so in mythology, there is nothing which had\r\nnot originally a meaning, that every name of the gods and heroes had a\r\nbeginning, a purpose, and a history.\r\n\r\nJupiter was no more called Jupiter by accident, than the Polynesian\r\n_Maui_, the Samoyede _Num_, or the Chinese _Tien_.(42) If we can discover\r\nthe original meaning of these names, we have reached the first ground of\r\ntheir later growth. I do not say that, if we can explain the first purpose\r\nof the mythological names, we have solved the whole riddle of mythology,\r\nbut I maintain that we have gained firm ground. I maintain that every true\r\netymology gives us an historical fact, because the first giving of a name\r\nwas an historical fact, and an historical fact of the greatest importance\r\nfor the later development of ancient ideas. Think only of this one fact,\r\nwhich no one would now venture to doubt, that the supreme deity of the\r\nGreeks, the Romans, the Germans, is called by the same name as the supreme\r\ndeity of the earliest Aryan settlers in India. Does not this one fact draw\r\naway the curtain from the dark ages of antiquity, and open before our eyes\r\nan horizon which we can hardly measure by years? The Greek _Zeus_ is the\r\nsame word as the Latin _Ju_ in _Jupiter_, as the German _Tiu_; and all\r\nthese were merely dialectic varieties of the Vedic _Dyaus_.(43) Now\r\n_dyaus_ in Sanskrit is the name of the sky, if used as a feminine; if used\r\nas a masculine, as it is still in the Veda, it is the sky as a man or as a\r\ngod—it is Zeus, the father of gods and men. You know, of course, that the\r\nwhole language of ancient India is but a sister dialect of Greek, Latin,\r\nof German, Keltic, and Slavonic, and that if the Greek says _es-ti_, he\r\nis, if the Roman says _est_, the German _ist_, the Slave _yesté_, the\r\nHindu, three thousand years ago, said _as-ti_, he is. This _as-ti_ is a\r\ncompound of a root _as_, to be, and the pronoun _ti_. The root meant\r\noriginally _to breathe_, and dwindled down after a time to the meaning of\r\n_to be_. All this must have happened before a single Greek or German\r\nreached the shores of Europe, and before a single Brahman descended into\r\nthe plains of India. At that distant time we must place the gradual growth\r\nof language and ideas, of a language which we are still speaking, of ideas\r\nwhich we are still thinking; and at the same time only can we explain the\r\nframing of those names which were the first attempts at grasping\r\nsupernatural powers, which became in time the names of the deities of the\r\nancient world, the heroes of mythology, the chief actors in many a legend,\r\nnay, some of which have survived in the nursery tales of our own time.(44)\r\n\r\nMy time, I see, is nearly over, but before I finish, I feel that I have a\r\nduty to perform from which I ought not to shrink. Some of those who have\r\nhonored me with their presence to-night may recollect that about a year\r\nago a lecture was delivered in this very room by Professor Blackie, in\r\nwhich he tried to throw discredit on the scientific method of the\r\ninterpretation of popular myths, or on what I call Comparative Mythology.\r\nHad he confined his remarks to the subject itself, I should have felt most\r\ngrateful for his criticisms, little minding the manner in which they were\r\nconveyed—for a student of language knows what words are made of. Nor, had\r\nhis personal reflections concerned myself alone, should I have felt called\r\nupon to reply to them thus publicly, for it has always seemed to me that\r\nunless we protest against unmerited praise, we have no right to protest\r\nagainst unmerited abuse. I believe I can appeal to all here present, that\r\nduring the many years I have had the honor to lecture in this Institution,\r\nI have _not once_ allowed myself to indulge in any personal remarks, or\r\nattacked those who, being absent, cannot defend themselves. Even when I\r\nhad to answer objections, or to refute false theories, I have always most\r\ncarefully avoided mentioning the names of living writers. But as Professor\r\nBlackie has directed his random blows, not against myself, but against a\r\nfriend of mine, Mr. Cox, the author of a work on Aryan Mythology, I feel\r\nthat I must for once try to get angry, and return blow for blow. Professor\r\nBlackie speaks of Mr. Cox as if he had done nothing beyond repeating what\r\nI had said before. Nothing can be more unfair. My own work in Comparative\r\nMythology has consisted chiefly in laying down some of the general\r\nprinciples of that science, and in the etymological interpretation of some\r\nof the ancient names of gods, goddesses, and heroes. In fact, I have made\r\nit a rule never to interpret or to compare the legends of India, Greece,\r\nItaly, or Germany, except in cases where it was possible, first of all, to\r\nshow an identity or similarity in the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, or German\r\nnames of the principal actors. Mr. Cox having convinced himself that the\r\nmethod which I have followed in mythology rests on sound and truly\r\nscientific principles, has adopted most, though by no means all, of my\r\netymological interpretations. Professor Blackie, on the contrary, without\r\nattempting any explanation of the identity of mythological names in Greek\r\nand Sanskrit which must be either disproved or explained, thunders forth\r\nthe following sentence of condemnation: “Even under the scientific\r\nguidance of a Bopp, a Bott, a Grimm, and a Müller, a sober man may\r\nsometimes, even in the full blaze of the new sun of comparative philology,\r\nallow himself to drink deep draughts, if not of _maundering madness_, at\r\nleast of _manifest hallucination_.”\r\n\r\nIf such words are thrown at my head, I pick them up chiefly as\r\netymological curiosities, and as striking illustrations of what Mr. Tylor\r\ncalls “survivals in culture,” showing how the most primitive implements of\r\nwarfare, rude stones and unpolished flints, which an ethnologist would\r\nsuppose to be confined to prehistoric races, to the red Indians of America\r\nor the wild Picts of Caledonia, turn up again most unexpectedly at the\r\npresent day in the very centre of civilized life. All I can say is, that\r\nif, as a student of Comparative Mythology, I have been drinking deep\r\ndraughts of maundering madness, I have been drinking in good company. In\r\nthis respect Mr. Cox has certainly given me far more credit than I\r\ndeserve. I am but one out of many laborers in this rich field of\r\nscientific research, and he ought to have given far greater prominence to\r\nthe labors of Grimm, Burnouf, Bopp, and, before all, of my learned friend,\r\nProfessor Kuhn.\r\n\r\nBut while, with regard to etymology, Mr. Cox contents himself with\r\nreporting the results of other scholars, he stands quite independent in\r\nhis own treatment of Comparative Mythology. Of this Professor Blackie\r\nseems to have no suspicion whatever. The plan which Mr. Cox follows is to\r\ncollect the coincidences in the legends themselves, and to show how in\r\ndifferent myths the same story with slight variations is told again and\r\nagain of different gods and heroes. In this respect his work is entirely\r\noriginal and very useful; for although these coincidences may be explained\r\nin different ways, and do not afford a proof of a common historical origin\r\nof the mythologies of India, Greece, Italy, and Germany, they are all the\r\nmore interesting from a purely psychological point of view, and supply\r\nimportant material for further researches. Mr. Tylor has lately worked\r\nwith great success in the same rich mine; extending the limits of\r\nmythological research far beyond the precincts of the Aryan world, and\r\nshowing that there are solar myths wherever the sun shines. I differ from\r\nMr. Cox on many points, as he differs from me. I shall certainly keep to\r\nmy own method of never attempting an interpretation or a comparison,\r\nexcept where the ground has first been cleared of all uncertainty by\r\netymological research, and where the names of different gods and heroes\r\nhave been traced back to a common source. I call this the _nominalistic_\r\nas opposed to the _realistic_ method of Comparative Mythology, and it is\r\nthe former only that concerns the student of the Science of Language. I\r\ngratefully acknowledge, however, the help which I have received from Mr.\r\nCox’s work, particularly as suggesting new clusters of myths that might be\r\ndisentangled by etymological analysis.\r\n\r\nBut not only has Professor Blackie failed to perceive the real character\r\nof Mr. Cox’s researches, but he has actually charged him with holding\r\nopinions which both Mr. Cox and myself have repeatedly disavowed, and most\r\nstrenuously opposed. Again and again have we warned the students of\r\nComparative Mythology that they must not expect to be able to explain\r\neverything. Again and again have we pointed out that there are irrational\r\nelements in mythology, and that we must be prepared to find grains of\r\nlocal history on which, as I said,(45) the sharpest tools of Comparative\r\nMythology must bend or break. Again and again have we shown that\r\nhistorical persons(46)—not only Cyrus and Charlemagne, but Frederick\r\nBarbarossa and even Frederick the Great—have been drawn into the vortex of\r\npopular mythology. Yet these are the words of Professor Blackie: “The cool\r\nway in which Max Müller and his English disciple, Mr. Cox, assume that\r\nthere are no human figures and historical characters in the whole gallery\r\nof heroes and demi-gods in the Greek Mythology, is something very\r\nremarkable.”\r\n\r\nI readily admit that some of the etymologies which I have proposed of\r\nmythological names are open to criticism; and if, like other scholars,\r\nProfessor Blackie had pointed out to me any cases where I might seem to\r\nhim to have offended against Grimm’s law or other phonetic rules, I should\r\nhave felt most grateful; but if he tells me that the Greek Erinys should\r\nnot be derived from the Sanskrit Sara_n_yû, but from the Greek verb\r\nἐρινύειν, to be angry, he might as well derive _critic_ from _to\r\ncriticise_;(47) and if he maintains that a name may have two or three\r\nlegitimate etymologies, I can only answer that we might as well say that a\r\nchild could have two or three legitimate mothers.\r\n\r\nI have most reluctantly entered upon these somewhat personal explanations,\r\nand I should not have done so if I alone had been concerned in Professor\r\nBlackie’s onslaught. I hope, however, that I have avoided anything that\r\ncould give just offence to Professor Blackie, even if he should be present\r\nhere tonight. Though he abuses me as a German, and laughs at the\r\ninstinctive aversion to external facts and the extravagant passion for\r\nself-evolved ideas as national failings of all Germans (I only wonder that\r\nthe story of the camel and the inner consciousness did not come in), yet I\r\nknow that for many years German poetry and German scholarship have had few\r\nmore ardent admirers, and German scholars few more trusty friends, than\r\nProfessor Blackie. Nationality, it seems to me, has as little to do with\r\nscholarship as with logic. On the contrary, in every nation he that will\r\nwork hard and reason honestly may be sure to discover some grains of\r\ntruth. National jealousies and animosities have no place in the republic\r\nof letters, which is, and I trust always will be, the true international\r\nrepublic of all friends of work, of order, and of truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III.\r\n\r\n\r\nON FALSE ANALOGIES IN COMPARATIVE THEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery different from the real similarities that can be discovered in nearly\r\nall the religions of the world, and which, owing to their deeply human\r\ncharacter, in no way necessitate the admission that one religion borrowed\r\nfrom the other, are those minute coincidences between the Jewish and the\r\nPagan religions which have so often been discussed by learned theologians,\r\nand which were intended by them as proof positive, either that the Pagans\r\nborrowed their religious ideas direct from the Old Testament, or that some\r\nfragments of a primeval revelation, granted to the ancestors of the whole\r\nrace of mankind, had been preserved in the temples of Greece and Italy.\r\n\r\nBochart, in his “Geographia Sacra,” considered the identity of Noah and\r\nSaturn so firmly established as hardly to admit of the possibility of a\r\ndoubt. The three sons of Saturn—Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto—he represented\r\nas having been originally the three sons of Noah: Jupiter being Ham;\r\nNeptune, Japhet; and Shem, Pluto. Even in the third generation the two\r\nfamilies were proved to have been one, for Phut, the son of Ham, or of\r\nJupiter Hammon, could be no other than Apollo Pythius; Canaan no other\r\nthan Mercury; and Nimrod no other than Bacchus, whose original name was\r\nsupposed to have been Bar-chus, the son of Cush. G. J. Vossius, in his\r\nlearned work, “De Origine et Progressu Idolatriæ” (1688), identified\r\nSaturn with Adam, Janus with Noah, Pluto with Ham, Neptune with Japhet,\r\nMinerva with Naamah, Vulcan with Tubal Cain, Typhon with Og. Huet, the\r\nfriend of Bochart, and the colleague of Bossuet, went still farther; and\r\nin his classical work, the “Demonstratio Evangelica,” he attempted to\r\nprove that the whole theology of the heathen nations was borrowed from\r\nMoses, whom he identified not only with ancient law-givers, like Zoroaster\r\nand Orpheus, but with gods and demi-gods, such as Apollo, Vulcan, Faunus,\r\nand Priapus.\r\n\r\nAll this happened not more than two hundred years ago; and even a hundred\r\nyears ago, nay, even after the discovery of Sanskrit and the rise of\r\nComparative Philology, the troublesome ghost of Huet was by no means laid\r\nat once. On the contrary, as soon as the ancient language and religion of\r\nIndia became known in Europe, they were received by many people in the\r\nsame spirit. Sanskrit, like all other languages, was to be derived from\r\nHebrew, the ancient religion of the Brahmans from the Old Testament.\r\n\r\nThere was at that time an enthusiasm among Oriental scholars, particularly\r\nat Calcutta, and an interest for Oriental antiquities in the public at\r\nlarge, of which we in these days of apathy for Eastern literature can\r\nhardly form an adequate idea. Everybody wished to be first in the field,\r\nand to bring to light some of the treasures which were supposed to be\r\nhidden in the sacred literature of the Brahmans. Sir William Jones, the\r\nfounder of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta, published in the first volume\r\nof the “Asiatic Researches” his famous essay, “On the Gods of Greece,\r\nItaly, and India;” and he took particular care to state that his essay,\r\nthough published only in 1788, had been written in 1784. In that essay he\r\nendeavored to show that there existed an intimate connection, not only\r\nbetween the mythology of India and that of Greece and Italy, but likewise\r\nbetween the legendary stories of the Brahmans and the accounts of certain\r\nhistorical events as recorded in the Old Testament. No doubt, the\r\ntemptation was great. No one could look down for a moment into the rich\r\nmine of religious and mythological lore that was suddenly opened before\r\nthe eyes of scholars and theologians, without being struck by a host of\r\nsimilarities, not only in the languages, but also in the ancient\r\ntraditions of the Hindus, the Greeks, and the Romans; and if at that time\r\nthe Greeks and Romans were still supposed to have borrowed their language\r\nand their religion from Jewish quarters, the same conclusion could hardly\r\nbe avoided with regard to the language and the religion of the Brahmans of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse to look in the ancient religion of India for\r\nreminiscences of revealed truth seems to have come from missionaries\r\nrather than from scholars. It arose from a motive, in itself most\r\nexcellent, of finding some common ground for those who wished to convert\r\nand those who were to be converted. Only, instead of looking for that\r\ncommon ground where it really was to be found—namely, in the broad\r\nfoundations on which all religions are built up: the belief in a divine\r\npower, the acknowledgment of sin, the habit of prayer, the desire to offer\r\nsacrifice, and the hope of a future life—the students of Pagan religion as\r\nwell as Christian missionaries were bent on discovering more striking and\r\nmore startling coincidences, in order to use them in confirmation of their\r\nfavorite theory that some rays of a primeval revelation, or some\r\nreflection of the Jewish religion, had reached the uttermost ends of the\r\nworld. This was a dangerous proceeding—dangerous because superficial,\r\ndangerous because undertaken with a foregone conclusion; and very soon the\r\nsame arguments that had been used on one side in order to prove that all\r\nreligious truth had been derived from the Old Testament were turned\r\nagainst Christian scholars and Christian missionaries, in order to show\r\nthat it was not Brahmanism and Buddhism which had borrowed from the Old\r\nand New Testament, but that the Old and the New Testament had borrowed\r\nfrom the more ancient religions of the Brahmans and Buddhists.\r\n\r\nThis argument was carried out, for instance, in Holwell’s “Original\r\nPrinciples of the Ancient Brahmans,” published in London as early as 1779,\r\nin which the author maintains that “the Brahmanic religion is the first\r\nand purest product of supernatural revelation,” and “that the Hindu\r\nscriptures contain to a moral certainty the original doctrines and terms\r\nof restoration delivered from God himself, by the mouth of his first\r\ncreated Birmah, to mankind, at his first creation in the form of man.”\r\n\r\nSir William Jones(48) tells us that one or two missionaries in India had\r\nbeen absurd enough, in their zeal for the conversion of the Gentiles, to\r\nurge “that the Hindus were even now almost Christians, because their\r\nBrahma, Vishnu, and Mahesa were no other than the Christian Trinity;” a\r\nsentence in which, he adds, we can only doubt whether folly, ignorance, or\r\nimpiety predominates.\r\n\r\nSir William Jones himself was not likely to fall into that error. He\r\nspeaks against it most emphatically. “Either,” he says, “the first eleven\r\nchapters of Genesis—all due allowance being made for a figurative Eastern\r\nstyle—are true, or the whole fabric of our national religion is false; a\r\nconclusion which none of us, I trust, would wish to be drawn. But it is\r\nnot the truth of our national religion as such that I have at heart; it is\r\ntruth itself; and if any cool, unbiassed reasoner will clearly convince me\r\nthat Moses drew his narrative through Egyptian conduits from the primeval\r\nfountains of Indian literature, I shall esteem him as a friend for having\r\nweeded my mind from a capital error, and promise to stand amongst the\r\nforemost in assisting to circulate the truth which he has ascertained.”\r\n\r\nBut though he speaks so strongly against the uncritical proceedings of\r\nthose who would derive anything that is found in the Old Testament from\r\nIndian sources, Sir William Jones himself was really guilty of the same\r\nwant of critical caution in his own attempts to identify the gods and\r\nheroes of Greece and Rome with the gods and heroes of India. He begins his\r\nessay,(49) “On the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India,” with the following\r\nremarks:—\r\n\r\n“We cannot justly conclude, by arguments preceding the proof of facts,\r\nthat one idolatrous people must have borrowed their deities, rites, and\r\ntenets from another, since gods of all shapes and dimensions may be framed\r\nby the boundless powers of imagination, or by the frauds and follies of\r\nmen, in countries never connected; but when features of resemblance, too\r\nstrong to have been accidental, are observable in different systems of\r\npolytheism, without fancy or prejudice to color them and improve the\r\nlikeness, we can scarce help believing that some connection has\r\nimmemorially subsisted between the several nations who have adopted them.\r\nIt is my design in this essay to point out such a resemblance between the\r\npopular worship of the old Greeks and Italians and that of the Hindus; nor\r\ncan there be any room to doubt of a great similarity between their strange\r\nreligions and that of Egypt, China, Persia, Phrygia, Phœnice, and Syria;\r\nto which, perhaps, we may safely add some of the southern kingdoms, and\r\neven islands of America; while the Gothic system which prevailed in the\r\nnorthern regions of Europe was not merely similar to those of Greece and\r\nItaly, but almost the same in another dress, with an embroidery of images\r\napparently Asiatic. From all this, if it be satisfactorily proved, we may\r\ninfer a general union or affinity between the most distinguished\r\ninhabitants of the primitive world at the time when they deviated, as they\r\ndid too early deviate, from the rational adoration of the only true God.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, in an essay written nearly a hundred years ago by Sir W.\r\nJones, one of the most celebrated Oriental scholars in England, it might\r\nseem as if we should find the first outlines of that science which is\r\nlooked upon as but of to-day or yesterday—the outlines of Comparative\r\nMythology. But in such an expectation we are disappointed. What we find is\r\nmerely a superficial comparison of the mythology of India and that of\r\nother nations, both Aryan and Semitic, without any scientific value,\r\nbecause carried out without any of those critical tests which alone keep\r\nComparative Mythology from running riot. This is not intended as casting a\r\nslur on Sir W. Jones. At his time the principles which have now been\r\nestablished by the students of the science of language were not yet known,\r\nand as with words, so with the names of deities, similarity of sound, the\r\nmost treacherous of all sirens, was the only guide in such researches.\r\n\r\nIt is not pleasant to have to find fault with a man possessed of such\r\ngenius, taste, and learning as Sir W. Jones, but no one who is acquainted\r\nwith the history of these researches will be surprised at my words. It is\r\nthe fate of all pioneers, not only to be left behind in the assault which\r\nthey had planned, but to find that many of their approaches were made in a\r\nfalse direction, and had to be abandoned. But as the authority of their\r\nnames continues to sway the public at large, and is apt to mislead even\r\npainstaking students and to entail upon them repeated disappointments, it\r\nis necessary that those who know should speak out, even at the risk of\r\nbeing considered harsh or presumptuous.\r\n\r\nA few instances will suffice to show how utterly baseless the comparisons\r\nare which Sir W. Jones instituted between the gods of India, Greece, and\r\nItaly. He compares the Latin Janus with the Sanskrit deity Ganesa. It is\r\nwell known that Janus is connected with the same root that has yielded the\r\nnames of Jupiter, Zeus, and Dyaus, while Ganesa is a compound, meaning\r\nlord of hosts, lord of the companies of gods.\r\n\r\nSaturnus is supposed to have been the same as Noah, and is then identified\r\nby Sir W. Jones with the Indian Manu Satyavrata, who escaped from the\r\nflood. Ceres is compared with the goddess Sri, Jupiter or Diespiter with\r\nIndra or Divaspati; and though etymology is called a weak basis for\r\nhistorical inquiries, the three syllables Jov in Jovis, Zeu in Zeus, and\r\nSiv in Siva are placed side by side, as possibly containing the same root,\r\nonly differently pronounced. Now the s of Siva is a palatal s, and no\r\nscholar who has once looked into a book on Comparative Philology need be\r\ntold that such an s could never correspond to a Greek Zeta or a Latin J.\r\n\r\nIn K_ri_sh_n_a, the lovely shepherd-god, Sir W. Jones recognizes the\r\nfeatures of Apollo Nomius, who fed the herds of Admetus, and slew the\r\ndragon Python; and he leaves it to etymologists to determine whether\r\nGopâla—_i. e._, the cow-herd—may not be the same word as Apollo. We are\r\nalso assured, on the authority of Colonel Vallancey, that K_ri_sh_n_a in\r\nIrish means the sun, and that the goddess Kâlî, to whom human sacrifices\r\nwere offered, as enjoined in the Vedas (?) was the same as Hekate. In\r\nconclusion, Sir W. Jones remarks, “I strongly incline to believe that\r\nEgyptian priests have actually come from the Nile to the Gangâ and Yamunâ,\r\nand that they visited the Sarmans of India, as the sages of Greece visited\r\nthem, rather to acquire than to impart knowledge.”\r\n\r\nThe interest that had been excited by Sir William Jones’s researches did\r\nnot subside, though he himself did not return to the subject, but devoted\r\nhis great powers to more useful labors. Scholars, both in India and in\r\nEurope, wanted to know more of the ancient religion of India. If Jupiter,\r\nApollo, and Janus had once been found in the ancient pantheon of the\r\nBrahmans; if the account of Noah and the deluge could be traced back to\r\nthe story of Manu Satyavrata, who escaped from the flood, more discoveries\r\nmight be expected in this newly-opened mine, and people rushed to it with\r\nall the eagerness of gold-diggers. The idea that everything in India was\r\nof extreme antiquity had at that time taken a firm hold on the minds of\r\nall students of Sanskrit; and, as there was no one to check their\r\nenthusiasm, everything that came to light in Sanskrit literature was\r\nreadily accepted as more ancient than Homer, or even than the Old\r\nTestament.\r\n\r\nIt was under these influences that Lieutenant Wilford, a contemporary of\r\nSir William Jones at Calcutta, took up the thread which Sir William Jones\r\nhad dropped, and determined at all hazards to solve the question which at\r\nthat time had excited a worldwide interest. Convinced that the Brahmans\r\npossessed in their ancient literature the originals, not only of Greek and\r\nRoman mythology, but likewise of the Old Testament history, he tried every\r\npossible means to overcome their reserve and reticence. He related to\r\nthem, as well as he could, the principal stories of classical mythology,\r\nand the leading events in the history of the Old Testament; he assured\r\nthem that they would find the same things in their ancient books, if they\r\nwould but look for them; he held out the hopes of ample rewards for any\r\nextracts from their sacred literature containing the histories of Adam and\r\nEve, of Deukalion and Prometheus; and at last he succeeded. The coyness of\r\nthe Pandits yielded; the incessant demand created a supply; and for\r\nseveral years essay after essay appeared in the “Asiatic Researches,” with\r\nextracts from Sanskrit MSS., containing not only the names of Deukalion,\r\nPrometheus, and other heroes and deities of Greece, but likewise the names\r\nof Adam and Eve, of Abraham and Sarah, and all the rest.\r\n\r\nGreat was the surprise, still greater the joy, not only in Calcutta, but\r\nin London, at Paris, and all the universities of Germany. The Sanskrit\r\nMSS. from which Lieutenant Wilford quoted, and on which his theories were\r\nbased, had been submitted to Sir W. Jones and other scholars; and though\r\nmany persons were surprised, and for a time even incredulous, yet the fact\r\ncould not be denied that all was found in these Sanskrit MSS. as stated by\r\nLieutenant Wilford. Sir W. Jones, then President of the Asiatic Society,\r\nprinted the following declaration at the end of the third volume of the\r\n“Asiatic Researches”:—\r\n\r\n“Since I am persuaded that the learned essay on Egypt and the Nile has\r\nafforded you equal delight with that which I have myself received from it,\r\nI cannot refrain from endeavoring to increase your satisfaction by\r\nconfessing openly that I have at length abandoned the greatest part of the\r\nnatural distrust, and incredulity which had taken possession of my mind\r\nbefore I had examined the sources from which our excellent associate,\r\nLieutenant Wilford, has drawn so great a variety of new and interesting\r\nopinions. Having lately read again and again, both alone and with a\r\nPandit, the numerous original passages in the Purânas, and other Sanskrit\r\nbooks, which the writer of the dissertation adduces in support of his\r\nassertions, I am happy in bearing testimony to his perfect good faith and\r\ngeneral accuracy, both in his extracts and in the translation of them.”\r\n\r\nSir W. Jones then proceeds himself to give a translation of some of these\r\npassages. “The following translation,” he writes, “of an extract from the\r\nPadma-purâna is minutely exact”:—\r\n\r\n“1. To _Satyavarman_, the sovereign of the whole earth, were born three\r\nsons; the eldest, _Sherma_; then _Charma_; and thirdly, _Jyapeti_.\r\n\r\n“2. They were all men of good morals, excellent in virtue and virtuous\r\ndeeds, skilled in the use of weapons to strike with, or to be thrown,\r\nbrave men, eager for victory in battle.\r\n\r\n“3. But _Satyavarman_, being continually delighted with devout meditation,\r\nand seeing his sons fit for dominion, laid upon them the burden of\r\ngovernment,\r\n\r\n“4. Whilst he remained honoring and satisfying the gods, and priests, and\r\nkine. One day, by the act of destiny, the king, having drunk mead,\r\n\r\n“5. Became senseless, and lay asleep naked; then was he seen by _Charma_,\r\nand by him were his two brothers called.\r\n\r\n“6. To whom he said: What now has befallen? In what state is this our\r\nsire? By those two was he hidden with clothes, and called to his senses\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\n“7. Having recovered his intellect, and perfectly knowing what had passed,\r\nhe cursed _Charma_, saying, Thou shalt be the servant of servants:\r\n\r\n“8. And since thou wast a laugher in their presence, from laughter shalt\r\nthou acquire a name. Then he gave to _Sherma_ the wide domain on the south\r\nof the snowy mountains.\r\n\r\n“9. And to _Jyapeti_ he gave all on the north of the snowy mountains; but\r\nhe, by the power of religious contemplation, obtained supreme bliss.”\r\n\r\nAfter this testimony from Sir W. Jones—wrung from him, as it would seem,\r\nagainst his own wish and will—Lieutenant Wilford’s essays became more\r\nnumerous and more startling every year.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the coincidences became too great. The MSS. were again\r\ncarefully examined; and then it was found that a clever forgery had been\r\ncommitted, that leaves had been inserted in ancient MSS., and that on\r\nthese leaves the Pandits, urged by Lieutenant Wilford to disclose their\r\nancient mysteries and traditions, had rendered in correct Sanskrit verse\r\nall that they had heard about Adam and Abraham from their inquisitive\r\nmaster. Lieutenant (then Colonel) Wilford did not hesitate for one moment\r\nto confess publicly that he had been imposed upon; but in the meantime the\r\nmischief had been done, his essays had been read all over Europe, they\r\nretained their place in the volumes of the “Asiatic Researches,” and to\r\nthe present day some of his statements and theories continue to be quoted\r\nauthoritatively by writers on ancient religion.\r\n\r\nSuch accidents, and, one might almost say, such misfortunes, will happen,\r\nand it would be extremely unfair were we to use unnecessarily harsh\r\nlanguage with regard to those to whom they have happened. It is perfectly\r\ntrue that at present, after the progress that has been made in an accurate\r\nand critical study of Sanskrit, it would be unpardonable if any Sanskrit\r\nscholar accepted such passages as those translated by Sir W. Jones as\r\ngenuine. Yet it is by no means certain that a further study of Sanskrit\r\nwill not lead to similar disenchantments, and deprive many a book in\r\nSanskrit literature which now is considered as very ancient of its claims\r\nto any high antiquity. Certain portions of the Veda even, which, as far as\r\nour knowledge goes at present, we are perfectly justified in referring to\r\nthe tenth or twelfth century before our era, may some day or other dwindle\r\ndown from their high estate, and those who have believed in their extreme\r\nantiquity will then be held up to blame or ridicule, like Sir W. Jones or\r\nColonel Wilford. This cannot be avoided, for science is progressive, and\r\ndoes not acknowledge, even in the most distinguished scholars, any claims\r\nto infallibility. One lesson only may we learn from the disappointment\r\nthat befell Colonel Wilford, and that is to be on our guard against\r\nanything which in ordinary language would be called “too good to be true.”\r\n\r\nComparative Philology has taught us again and again that when we find a\r\nword exactly the same in Greek and Sanskrit, we may be certain that it\r\ncannot be the same word; and the same applies to Comparative Mythology.\r\nThe same god or the same hero cannot have exactly the same name in\r\nSanskrit and Greek, for the simple reason that Sanskrit and Greek have\r\ndeviated from each other, have both followed their own way, have both\r\nsuffered their own phonetic corruptions; and hence, if they do possess the\r\nsame word, they can only possess it either in its Greek or its Sanskrit\r\ndisguise. And if that caution applies to Sanskrit and Greek, members of\r\nthe same family of language, how much more strongly must it apply to\r\nSanskrit and Hebrew! If the first man were called in Sanskrit Âdima, and\r\nin Hebrew Adam, and if the two were really the same word, then Hebrew and\r\nSanskrit could not be members of two different families of speech, or we\r\nshould be driven to admit that Adam was borrowed by the Jews from the\r\nHindus for it is in Sanskrit only that âdima means the first, whereas in\r\nHebrew it has no such meaning.\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies to a curious coincidence pointed out many years\r\nago by Mr. Ellis in his “Polynesian Researches” (London, 1829, vol. ii. p.\r\n38). We there read:—\r\n\r\n“A very generally received Tahitian tradition is that the first human pair\r\nwere made by Taaroa, the principal deity formerly acknowledged by the\r\nnation. On more than one occasion I have listened to the details of the\r\npeople respecting his work of creation. They say that, after Taaroa had\r\nformed the world, he created man out of araea, red earth, which was also\r\nthe food of man until bread first was made. In connection with this some\r\nrelate that Taaroa one day called for the man by name. When he came, he\r\ncaused him to fall asleep, and, while he slept, he took out one of his\r\n_ivi_, or bones, and with it made a woman, whom he gave to the man as his\r\nwife, and they became the progenitors of mankind. This,” Mr. Ellis\r\ncontinues, “always appeared to me a mere recital of the Mosaic account of\r\ncreation, which they had heard from some European, and I never placed any\r\nreliance on it, although they have repeatedly told me it was a tradition\r\namong them before any foreigners arrived. Some have also stated that the\r\nwoman’s name was _Ivi_, which would be by them pronounced as if written\r\n_Eve_. _Ivi_ is an aboriginal word, and not only signifies a bone, but\r\nalso a widow, and a victim slain in war. Notwithstanding the assertion of\r\nthe natives, I am disposed to think that _Ivi_, or _Eve_, is the only\r\naboriginal part of the story, as far as it respects the mother of the\r\nhuman race. Should more careful and minute inquiry confirm the truth of\r\nthis declaration, and prove that their account was in existence among them\r\nprior to their intercourse with Europeans, it will be the most remarkable\r\nand valuable oral tradition of the origin of the human race yet known.”\r\n\r\nIn this case, I believe the probability is that the story of the creation\r\nof the first woman from the bone of a man(50) existed among the Tahitians\r\nbefore their intercourse with Christians, but I need hardly add that the\r\nsimilarity between the Polynesian name for bone, _ivi_, even when it was\r\nused as the name of the first woman, and the English corruption of the\r\nHebrew הוה, Chāvah, Eve, could be the result of accident only. Whatever\r\nChāvah meant in Hebrew, whether life or living or anything else, it never\r\nmeant bone, while the Tahitian _ivi_, the Maori _wheva_,(51) meant bone,\r\nand bone only.\r\n\r\nThese principles and these cautions were hardly thought of in the days of\r\nSir William Jones and Colonel Wilford, but they ought to be thought of at\r\npresent. Thus, before Bopp had laid down his code of phonetic laws, and\r\nbefore Burnouf had written his works on Buddhism, one cannot be very much\r\nsurprised that Buddha should have been identified with Minos and Lamech;\r\nnay, that even the Babylonian deity Belus, and the Teutonic deity Wodan or\r\nOdin, should have been supposed to be connected with the founder of\r\nBuddhism in India. As Burnouf said in his “Introduction a l’Histoire du\r\nBuddhisme,” p. 70: “On avait même fait du Buddha une planète; et je ne\r\nsais pas si quelques savants ne se plaisent pas encore aujourd’hui à\r\nretrouver ce sage paisible sous les traits du belliqueux Odin.” But we did\r\nnot expect that we should have to read again, in a book published in 1869,\r\nsuch statements as these:(52)—\r\n\r\n“There is certainly a much greater similarity between the Buddhism of the\r\nTopes and the Scandinavian mythology than between it and the Buddhism of\r\nthe books; but still the gulf between the two is immense; and if any\r\ntraces of the doctrines of the gentle ascetic (Buddha) ever existed in the\r\nbosom of Odin or his followers, while dwelling near the roots of the\r\nCaucasus, all that can be said is, that they suffered fearful shipwreck\r\namong the rocks of the savage superstitions of the North, and sank, never\r\nagain to appear on the surface of Scandinavian mythology. If the two\r\nreligions come anywhere in contact, it is at their base, for underlying\r\nboth there existed a strange substratum of Tree and Serpent Worship; on\r\nthis the two structures seem to have been raised, though they afterwards\r\ndiverged into forms so strangely dissimilar” (p. 34).\r\n\r\nOr again (p. 32):—\r\n\r\n“We shall probably not err far if we regard these traces of serpent\r\nworship as indicating the presence in the Northeast of Scotland of the\r\nhead of that column of migration, or of propagandism, which, under the\r\nmyth of Wodenism, we endeavored in a previous chapter to trace from the\r\nCaucasus to Scandinavia.”\r\n\r\n“The arbors under which two of the couples are seated are curious\r\ninstances of that sort of summer-house which may be found adorning\r\ntea-gardens in the neighborhood of London to the present day. It is scenes\r\nlike these that make us hesitate before asserting that there could not\r\npossibly be any connection between Buddhism and Wodenism” (p. 140).\r\n\r\n“One of the most tempting nominal similarities connected with this subject\r\nis suggested by the name of Mâyâ. The mother of Buddha was called Mâyâ.\r\nThe mother of Mercury was also Maia, the daughter of Atlas. The Romans\r\nalways called Wodin, Mercury, and _dies Mercurii_ and _Wodensday_ alike\r\ndesignated the fourth day of the week.... These and other similarities\r\nhave been frequently pointed out and insisted upon, and they are too\r\nnumerous and too distinct not to have some foundation in reality” (p. 186,\r\nnote).\r\n\r\nStatements like these cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed or\r\nuncontradicted, particularly if supported by the authority of a great\r\nname; and after having spoken so freely of the unscientific character of\r\nthe mythological comparisons instituted by scholars like Sir William Jones\r\nand Lieutenant Wilford, who can no longer defend themselves, it would be\r\nmere cowardice to shrink from performing the same unpleasant duty in the\r\ncase of a living writer, who has shown that he knows how to wield the\r\nweapons both of defence and attack.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true that the mother of Buddha was called Mâyâ, but it is\r\nequally true that the Sanskrit Mâyâ cannot be the Greek Maiā. It is quite\r\ntrue, also, that the fourth day of the week is called _dies Mercurii_ in\r\nLatin, and Wednesday in English; nay, that in Sanskrit the same day is\r\ncalled _Budha-dina_ or _Budha-vâra_. But the origin of all these names\r\nfalls within perfectly historical times, and can throw no light whatever\r\non the early growth of mythology and religion.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we have to distinguish between _Budha_ and _Buddha_. The two\r\nnames, though so like each other, and therefore constantly mistaken one\r\nfor the other, have nothing in common but their root. _Buddha_ with two\r\nd’s, is the participle of _budh_, and means awakened, enlightened.(53) It\r\nis the name given to those who have reached the highest stage of human\r\nwisdom, and it is known most generally as the title of Gotama,\r\n_S_âkya-muni, the founder of Buddhism, whose traditional era dates from\r\n543 B. C. _Budha_, on the contrary, with one d, means simply knowing, and\r\nit became in later times, when the Hindus received from the Greeks a\r\nknowledge of the planets, the name of the planet Mercury.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the names of the seven days of the week are derived\r\nfrom the names of the planets,(54) and it is equally well known that in\r\nEurope the system of weeks and week-days is comparatively of very modern\r\norigin. It was not a Greek, nor a Roman, nor a Hindu, but a Jewish or\r\nBabylonian invention. The Sabbath (Sabbata) was known and kept at Rome in\r\nthe first century B. C. with many superstitious practices. It is mentioned\r\nby Horace, Ovid, Tibullus (_dies Saturni_), Persius, Juvenal. Ovid calls\r\nit a day “_rebus minus apta gerendis_.” Augustus (Suet. “Aug.” c. 76)\r\nevidently imagined that the Jews fasted on their Sabbath, for he said,\r\n“Not even a Jew keeps the fast of the Sabbath so strictly as I have kept\r\nthis day.” In fact, Josephus (“Contra Apion.” ii. 39) was able to say that\r\nthere was no town, Greek or not Greek, where the custom observing the\r\nseventh day had not spread.(55) It is curious that we find the seventh\r\nday, the Sabbath, even under its new Pagan name, as _dies Saturni_ or\r\n_Kronike_, mentioned by Roman and Greek writers, before the names of the\r\nother days of the week made their appearance. Tibullus speaks of the day\r\nof Saturn, _dies Saturni_; Julius Frontinus (under Nerva, 96-98) says that\r\nVespasian attacked the Jews on the day of Saturn, _dies Saturni_; and\r\nJustin Martyr (died 165) states that Christ was crucified the day before\r\nthe day of Kronos, and appeared to his disciples the day after the day of\r\nKronos. He does not use the names of Friday and Sunday. Sunday, as _dies\r\nSolis_, is mentioned by Justin Martyr (“Apolog.” i. 67), and by Tertullian\r\n(died 220), the usual name of that day amongst Christians being the\r\nLord’s-day, Κυριακή, _dominica_ or _dominicus_. Clemens of Alexandria\r\n(died 220) seems to have been the first who used the names of Wednesday\r\nand Friday, Ἑρμοῦ καὶ Ἀφροδίτης ἡμέρα.\r\n\r\nIt is generally stated, on the authority of Cassius Dio, that the system\r\nof counting by weeks and weekdays was first introduced in Egypt, and that\r\nat his time, early in the third century, the Romans had adopted it, though\r\nbut recently. Be this as it may, it would seem that, if Tibullus could use\r\nthe name of _dies Saturni_ for Saturday, the whole system of weekdays must\r\nhave been settled and known at Rome in his time. Cassius Dio tells us that\r\nthe names were assigned to each day διὰ τεσσάρων, by fours; or by giving\r\nthe first hour of the week to Saturn, then giving one hour to each planet\r\nin succession, till the twenty-fifth hour became again the first of the\r\nnext day. Both systems lead to the same result, as will be seen from the\r\nfollowing table:—\r\n\r\n_Planets._    _Latin._        _French._      _Sanskrit._\r\n1 Saturn 1    Dies Saturni    Samedi (dies   Saui-vāra\r\n                              sabbati)\r\n2 Jupiter 6   Dies Solis      Dimanche       Ravi-vāra\r\n                              (dominicus)\r\n3 Mars 4      Dies Lunæ       Lundi          Soma-vāra\r\n4 Sun 2       Dies Martis     Mardi          Bhauma-vāra\r\n5 Venus 7     Dies Mercurii   Mercredi       Brihaspati-vāra\r\n7 Moon 3      Dies Veneris    Vendredi       Sukra-vāra\r\n\r\n_Planets._    _Old Norse._    _Anglo-Saxon._   _English._\r\n1 Saturn 1    laugardagr      sätres däg       Saturday\r\n              (washing day)\r\n2 Jupiter 6   sunnadagr       sunnan däg       Sunday\r\n3 Mars 4      mânadagr        monan däg        Monday\r\n4 Sun 2       tysdagr         tives däg        Tuesday\r\n5 Venus 7     odhinsdagr      vôdenes däg      Wednesday\r\n6 Mercury 5   thôrsdagr       thunores däg     Thursday\r\n7 Moon 3      friadagr        frige däg        Friday\r\n\r\n_Planets._    _Old-High           _Middle-High      _German._\r\n              German._            German._\r\n1 Saturn 1    sambaztag (sunnûn   samztac (sunnen   Samstag\r\n              âband)              âbent)            (Sonnabend)\r\n2 Jupiter 6   sunnûn dag          sunnen tac        Sonntag\r\n3 Mars 3      mânin tac (?)       mân tac           Montag\r\n4 Sun 2       ziuwes tac (cies    zies tac (zies    Dienstag\r\n              dac)                tac)\r\n5 Venus 7     wuotanes tac (?)    mittwoch          Mittwoch\r\n              (mittawecha)\r\n6 Mercury 5   donares tac         donres tac        Donnerstag\r\n7 Moon 3      fria dag            frîtac            Freitag\r\n\r\nAfter the names of the week-days had once been settled, we have no\r\ndifficulty in tracing their migration towards the East and towards the\r\nWest. The Hindus had their own peculiar system of reckoning days and\r\nmonths, but they adopted at a later time the foreign system of counting by\r\nweeks of seven days, and assigning a presiding planetary deity to each of\r\nthe seven days, according to the system described above. As the Indian\r\nname of the planet Mercury was Budha, the _dies Mercurii_ was naturally\r\ncalled _Budha-vâra_ but never _Buddha-vâra_; and the fact that the mother\r\nof Mercury was called Maia, and the mother of Buddha Mâyâ, could,\r\ntherefore, have had no bearing whatever on the name assigned to the Indian\r\nWednesday.(56) The very Buddhists, in Ceylon, distinguish between buddha,\r\nthe enlightened, and budha, wise, and call Wednesday the day of Budha, not\r\nof Buddha.(57) Whether the names of the planets were formed in India\r\nindependently, or after Greek models, is difficult to settle. The name of\r\nBudha, the knowing or the clever, given to the planet Mercury, seems,\r\nhowever, inexplicable except on the latter hypothesis.\r\n\r\nHaving traced the origin of the Sanskrit name of the _dies Mercurii_,\r\nBudha-vâra, let us now see why the Teutonic nations, though perfectly\r\nignorant of Buddhism, called the same day the day of Wodan.\r\n\r\nThat the Teutonic nations received the names of the week-days from their\r\nGreek and Roman neighbors admits of no doubt. For commercial and military\r\narrangements between Romans and Germans some kind of _lingua franca_ must\r\nsoon have sprung up, and in it the names of the week-days must have found\r\ntheir place. There would have been little difficulty in explaining the\r\nmeaning of Sun-day and Mon-day to the Germans, but in order to make them\r\nunderstand the meaning of the other names, some explanations must have\r\nbeen given on the nature of the different deities, in order to enable the\r\nGermans to find corresponding names in their own language. A Roman would\r\ntell his German friend that _dies Veneris_ meant the day of a goddess who\r\nrepresented beauty and love, and on hearing this the German would at once\r\nhave thought of his own goddess of love, _Freyja_, and have called the\r\n_dies Veneris_ the day of _Freyja_ or Friday.(58)\r\n\r\nIf _Jupiter_ was described as the god who wields the thunderbolt, his\r\nnatural representative in German would be _Donar_,(59) the Anglo-Saxon\r\n_Thunar_, the Old Norse _Thor_; and hence the _dies Jovis_ would be called\r\nthe day of _Thor_, or Thursday. If the fact that Jupiter was the king of\r\nthe gods had been mentioned, his proper representative in German would, no\r\ndoubt, have been _Wuotan_ or _Odin_.(60) As it was, _Wuotan_ or _Odin_ was\r\nchosen as the nearest approach to _Mercury_, the character which they\r\nshare in common, and which led to their identification, being most likely\r\ntheir love of travelling through the air,(61) also their granting wealth\r\nand fulfilling the wishes of their worshippers, in which capacity Wuotan\r\nis known by the name of _Wunsch_(62) or _Wish_. We can thus understand how\r\nit happened that father and son changed places, for while _Mercurius_ is\r\nthe son of _Jupiter_, _Wuotan_ is the father of _Donar_. _Mars_, the god\r\nof war, was identified with the German _Tiu_ or _Ziu_, a name which,\r\nthough originally the same as _Zeus_ in Greek or _Dyaus_ in Sanskrit, took\r\na peculiarly national character among the Germans, and became their god of\r\nwar.(63)\r\n\r\nThere remained thus only the _dies Saturni_, the day of Saturn, and\r\nwhether this was called so in imitation of the Latin name, or after an old\r\nGerman deity of a similar name and character, is a point which for the\r\npresent we must leave unsettled.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, is not unsettled is this, that if the Germans, in\r\ninterpreting these names of Roman deities as well as they could, called\r\nthe _dies Mercurii_, the same day which the Hindus had called the day of\r\n_Budha_ (with one _d_), their day of _Wuotan_, this was not because “the\r\ndoctrines of the gentle ascetic existed in the bosom of Odin or his\r\nfollowers, while dwelling near the roots of the Caucasus,” but for very\r\ndifferent and much more tangible reasons.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from all this, by what possible process could Buddha and Odin\r\nhave ever been brought together in the flesh? In the history of ancient\r\nreligions, Odin belongs to the same stratum of mythological thought as\r\n_Dyaus_ in India, _Zeus_ in Greece, _Jupiter_ in Italy. He was worshipped\r\nas the supreme deity during a period long anterior to the age of the Veda\r\nand of Homer. His travels in Greece, and even in Tyrkland,(64) and his\r\nhalf-historical character as a mere hero and a leader of his people, are\r\nthe result of the latest Euhemerism. Buddha, on the contrary, is not a\r\nmythological, but a personal and historical character, and to think of a\r\nmeeting of Buddha and Odin, or even of their respective descendants, at\r\nthe roots of Mount Caucasus, would be like imagining an interview between\r\nCyrus and Odin, between Mohammed and Aphrodite.\r\n\r\nA comparative study of ancient religions and mythologies, as will be seen\r\nfrom these instances, is not a subject to be taken up lightly. It requires\r\nnot only an accurate acquaintance with the minutest details of comparative\r\nphilology, but a knowledge of the history of religions which can hardly be\r\ngained without a study of original documents. As long, however, as\r\nresearches of this kind are carried on for their own sake, and from a mere\r\ndesire of discovering truth, without any ulterior objects, they deserve no\r\nblame, though, for a time, they may lead to erroneous results. But when\r\ncoincidences between different religions and mythologies are searched out\r\nsimply in support of preconceived theories, whether by the friends or\r\nenemies of religion, the sense of truth, the very life of all science, is\r\nsacrificed, and serious mischief will follow without fail. Here we have a\r\nright, not only to protest, but to blame. There is on this account a great\r\ndifference between the books we have hitherto examined, and a work lately\r\npublished in Paris by M. Jacolliot, under the sensational title of “La\r\nBible dans l’Inde, Vie de Jeseus Christna.” If this book had been written\r\nwith the pure enthusiasm of Lieutenant Wilford, it might have been passed\r\nby as a mere anachronism. But when one sees how its author shuts his eyes\r\nagainst all evidence that would tell against him, and brings together,\r\nwithout any critical scruples, whatever seems to support his theory that\r\nChristianity is a mere copy of the ancient religion of India, mere silence\r\nwould not be a sufficient answer. Besides, the book has lately been\r\ntranslated into English, and will be read, no doubt, by many people who\r\ncannot test the evidence on which it professes to be founded. We learn\r\nthat M. Jacolliot was some years ago appointed President of the Court of\r\nJustice at Chandernagore, and that he devoted the leisure left him from\r\nthe duties of his position to studying Sanskrit and the holy books of the\r\nHindus. He is said to have put himself in communication with the Brahmans,\r\nwho had obtained access to a great number of MSS. carefully stored up in\r\nthe depths of the pagodas. “The purport of his book is” (I quote from a\r\nfriendly critic), “that our civilization, our religion, our legends, our\r\ngods, have come to us from India, after passing in succession through\r\nEgypt, Persia, Judea, Greece, and Italy.” This statement, we are told, is\r\nnot confined to M. Jacolliot, but has been admitted by almost all Oriental\r\nscholars. The Old and New Testaments are found again in the Vedas, and the\r\ntexts quoted by M. Jacolliot in support of his theory are said to leave it\r\nwithout doubt. Brahma created Adima (in Sanskrit, the first man) and gave\r\nhim for companion Heva (in Sanskrit, that which completes life). He\r\nappointed the island of Ceylon for their residence. What follows\r\nafterwards is so beautifully described that I may be pardoned for quoting\r\nit. Only I must warn my readers, lest the extract should leave too deep an\r\nimpression on their memory, that what M. Jacolliot calls a simple\r\ntranslation from Sanskrit is, as far as I can judge, a simple invention of\r\nsome slightly mischievous Brahman, who, like the Pandits of Lieutenant\r\nWilford, took advantage of the zeal and credulity of a French judge:—\r\n\r\n“Having created the Man and the Woman (_simultaneously_, not one after the\r\nother), and animated them with the divine afflatus—the Lord said unto\r\nthem: ‘Behold, your mission is to people this beautiful Island [Ceylon],\r\nwhere I have gathered together everything pleasant and needful for your\r\nsubsistence—the rest of the Earth is as yet uninhabitable, but should your\r\nprogeny so increase as to render the bounds of paradise too narrow a\r\nhabitation, let them inquire of me by sacrifice and I will make known my\r\nwill.’\r\n\r\n“And thus saying, the Lord disappeared....\r\n\r\n“Then Adam and Eve dwelt together for a time in perfect happiness; but ere\r\nlong a vague disquietude began to creep upon them.... The Spirit of Evil,\r\njealous of their felicity and of the work of Brahma, inspired them with\r\ndisturbing thoughts;—‘Let us wander through the Island,’ said Adam to his\r\ncompanion, ‘and see if we may not find some part even more beautiful than\r\nthis.’ ...\r\n\r\n“And Eve followed her husband ... wandering for days and for months; ...\r\nbut as they advanced the woman was seized with strange and inexplicable\r\nterrors: ‘Adam,’ said she, ‘let us go no farther: it seems to me that we\r\nare disobeying the Lord; have we not already quitted the place which he\r\nassigned us for a dwelling and forbade us to leave?’\r\n\r\n“ ‘Fear not,’ replied Adam; ‘this is not that fearful wilderness of which\r\nhe spake to us.’ ....\r\n\r\n“And they wandered on....\r\n\r\n“Arriving at last at the extremity of the Island, they beheld a smooth and\r\nnarrow arm of the sea, and beyond it a vast and apparently boundless\r\ncountry, connected with their Island only by a narrow and rocky pathway\r\narising from the bosom of the waters.\r\n\r\n“The wanderers stood amazed: the country before them was covered with\r\nstately trees, birds of a thousand colors flitting amidst their foliage.\r\n\r\n“... ‘Behold, what beautiful things!’ cried Adam, ‘and what good fruit\r\nsuch trees must produce; ... let us go and taste them, and if that country\r\nis better than this, we will dwell there.’\r\n\r\n“Eve, trembling, besought Adam to do nothing that might irritate the Lord\r\nagainst them. ‘Are we not well here? Have we not pure water and delicious\r\nfruits? Wherefore seek other things?’\r\n\r\n“ ‘True,’ replied Adam, ‘but we will return; what harm can it be to visit\r\nthis unknown country that presents itself to our view?’ .... And as he\r\napproached the rocks, Eve, trembling, followed.\r\n\r\n“Placing his wife upon his shoulders, he proceeded to cross the space that\r\nseparated him from the object of his desires, but no sooner did he touch\r\nthe shore than trees, flowers, fruits, birds, all that they had perceived\r\nfrom the opposite side, in an instant vanished amidst terrific clamor; ...\r\nthe rocks by which they had crossed sunk beneath the waters, a few sharp\r\npeaks alone remaining above the surface, to indicate the place of the\r\nbridge which had been destroyed by Divine displeasure.\r\n\r\n“The vegetation which they had seen from the opposite shore was but a\r\ndelusive mirage raised by the Spirit of Evil to tempt them to\r\ndisobedience.\r\n\r\n“Adam fell, weeping, upon the naked sands, ... but Eve throwing herself\r\ninto his arms, besought him not to despair; ... ‘let us rather pray to the\r\nAuthor of all things to pardon us.’ ....\r\n\r\n“And as she spake there came a voice from the clouds, saying,\r\n\r\n“ ‘Woman! _thou_ hast only sinned from love to thy husband, whom I\r\ncommanded thee to love, and thou hast hoped in me.\r\n\r\n“ ‘I therefore pardon thee—and I pardon him also for _thy_ sake: ... but\r\nye may no more return to paradise, which I had created for your happiness;\r\n... through your disobedience to my commands the Spirit of Evil has\r\nobtained possession of the Earth.... Your children reduced to labor and to\r\nsuffer by your fault will become corrupt and forget me....\r\n\r\n“ ‘But I will send Vish_n_u, who will be born of a woman, and who will\r\nbring to all the hope of a reward in another life, and the means by prayer\r\nof softening their sufferings.’ ”\r\n\r\nThe translator from whom I have quoted exclaims at the end, as well he\r\nmight:—\r\n\r\n“What grandeur and what simplicity is this Hindu legend! and at the same\r\ntime how simply logical!... Behold here the veritable Eve—the true woman.”\r\n\r\nBut much more extraordinary things are quoted by M. Jacolliot, from the\r\nVedas and the commentaries.\r\n\r\nOn p. 63 we read that Manu, Minos, and Manes, had the same name as Moses;\r\non p. 73, the Brahmans who invaded India are represented as the successors\r\nof a great reformer called Christna. The name of Zoroaster is derived from\r\nthe Sanskrit Sûryastara (p. 110), meaning “he who spreads the worship of\r\nthe Sun.” After it has been laid down (p. 116) that Hebrew was derived\r\nfrom Sanskrit, we are assured that there is little difficulty in deriving\r\nJehovah from Zeus.(65) Zeus, Jezeus, Jesus, and Isis are all declared to\r\nbe the same name, and later on (p. 130) we learn that “at present the\r\nBrahmans who officiate in the pagodas and temples give this title of\r\nJeseus—_i. e._ the pure essence, the divine emanation—to Christna only,\r\nwho alone is recognized as the Word, the truly incarnated, by the\r\nworshippers of Vish_n_u and the freethinkers among the Brahmans.”\r\n\r\nWe are assured that the Apostles, the poor fishermen of Galilee, were able\r\nto read the Veda (p. 356); and it was their greatest merit that they did\r\nnot reject the miraculous accounts of the Vedic period, because the world\r\nwas not yet ripe for freedom of thought. Kristna, or Christna, we read on\r\np. 360, signified in Sanskrit, sent by God, promised by God, holy; and as\r\nthe name of Christ or _Christos_ is not Hebrew, whence could it have been\r\ntaken except from Krishna, the son of Devakî, or, as M. Jacolliot writes,\r\nDevanaguy?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, nay, almost impossible, to criticise or refute such\r\nstatements, and yet it is necessary to do so; for such is the interest, or\r\nI should rather say the feverish curiosity, excited by anything that bears\r\non ancient religion, that M. Jacolliot’s book has produced a very wide and\r\nvery deep impression. It has been remarked with some surprise that Vedic\r\nscholars in Europe had failed to discover these important passages in the\r\nVeda which he has pointed out, or, still worse, that they had never\r\nbrought them to the knowledge of the public. In fact, if anything was\r\nwanting to show that a general knowledge of the history of ancient\r\nreligion ought to form part of our education, it was the panic created by\r\nM. Jacolliot’s book. It is simply the story of Lieutenant Wilford over\r\nagain, only far less excusable now than a hundred years ago. Many of the\r\nwords which M. Jacolliot quotes as Sanskrit are not Sanskrit at all;\r\nothers never have the meaning which he assigns to them; and as to the\r\npassages from the Vedas (including our old friend the Bhagaveda-gîta),\r\nthey are not from the Veda, they are not from any old Sanskrit writer—they\r\nsimply belong to the second half of the nineteenth century. What happened\r\nto Lieutenant Wilford has happened again to M. Jacolliot. He tells us the\r\nsecret himself:—\r\n\r\n“One day,” he says (p. 280), “when we were reading the translation of\r\nManu, by Sir W. Jones, a note led us to consult the Indian commentator,\r\nKullûka Bha_tt_a, when we found an allusion to the sacrifice of a son by\r\nhis father prevented by God himself after he had commanded it. We then had\r\nonly one _idée fixe_—namely, to find again in the dark mass of the\r\nreligious books of the Hindu, the original account of that event. We\r\nshould never have succeeded but for ‘the complaisance’ of a Brahman with\r\nwhom we were reading Sanskrit, and who, yielding to our request, brought\r\nus from the library of his pagoda the works of the theologian Ramatsariar,\r\nwhich have yielded us such precious assistance in this volume.”\r\n\r\nAs to the story of the son offered as a sacrifice by his father, and\r\nreleased at the command of the gods, M. Jacolliot might have found the\r\noriginal account of it from the Veda, both text and translation, in my\r\n“History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature.” He would soon have seen that the\r\nstory of _S_una_hs_epa being sold by his father in order to be sacrificed\r\nin the place of an Indian prince, has very little in common with the\r\nintended sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham. M. Jacolliot has, no doubt, found\r\nout by this time that he has been imposed upon; and if so, he ought to\r\nfollow the example of Colonel Wilford, and publicly state what has\r\nhappened. Even then, I doubt not that his statements will continue to be\r\nquoted for a long time, and that _Adima_ and _Heva_, thus brought to life\r\nagain, will make their appearance in many a book and many a lecture-room.\r\n\r\nLest it be supposed that such accidents happen to Sanskrit scholars only,\r\nor that this fever is bred only in the jungles of Indian mythology, I\r\nshall mention at least one other case which will show that this disease is\r\nof a more general character, and that want of caution will produce it in\r\nevery climate.\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of Sanskrit, China had stood for a long time in the\r\nplace which was afterwards occupied by India. When the ancient literature\r\nand civilization of China became first known to the scholars of Europe,\r\nthe Celestial Empire had its admirers and prophets as full of enthusiasm\r\nas Sir W. Jones and Lieutenant Wilford, and there was nothing, whether\r\nGreek philosophy or Christian morality, that was not supposed to have had\r\nits first origin among the sages of China. The proceedings of the Jesuit\r\nmissionaries in China were most extraordinary. They had themselves\r\nadmitted the antiquity of the writings of Confucius and Lao-tse, both of\r\nwhom lived in the sixth century B. C.(66) But in their zeal to show that\r\nthe sacred books of the Chinese contained numerous passages borrowed from\r\nthe Bible, nay, even some of the dogmas of the later Church, they hardly\r\nperceived that, taking into account the respective dates of these books,\r\nthey were really proving that a kind of anticipated Christianity had been\r\naccorded to the ancient sages of the Celestial Empire. The most learned\r\nadvocate of this school was Father Prémare. Another supporter of the same\r\nview, Montucci,(67) speaking of Lao-tse’s Tao-te-king, says:—\r\n\r\n“We find in it so many sayings clearly referring to the triune God, that\r\nno one who has read this book can doubt that the mystery of the most holy\r\nTrinity was revealed to the Chinese more than five centuries before the\r\nadvent of Christ. Everybody, therefore, who knows the strong feeling of\r\nthe Chinese for their own teachers, will admit that nothing more efficient\r\ncould be found in order to fix the dogmas of the Christian religion in the\r\nmind of the Chinese than the demonstration that these dogmas agree with\r\ntheir own books. The study, therefore, and the translation of this\r\nsingular book (the Tao-te-king) would prove most useful to the\r\nmissionaries, in order to bring to a happy issue the desired gathering in\r\nof the Apostolic harvest.”\r\n\r\nWhat followed is so extraordinary that, though it has often been related,\r\nit deserves to be related again, more particularly as the whole problem\r\nwhich was supposed to have been solved once for all by M. Stanislas\r\nJulien, has of late been opened again by Dr. von Strauss, in the “Journal\r\nof the German Oriental Society,” 1869.\r\n\r\nThere is a passage at the beginning of the fourteenth chapter of the\r\nTao-te-king in which Father Amyot felt certain that the three Persons of\r\nthe Trinity could be recognized. He translated it:—\r\n\r\n“He who is as it were visible but cannot be seen is called _Khi_.\r\n\r\n“He whom we cannot hear, and who does not speak to our ear, is called\r\n_Hi_.\r\n\r\n“He who is as it were tangible, but cannot be touched, is called _Wei_.”\r\n\r\nFew readers, I believe, would have been much startled by this passage, or\r\nwould have seen in it what Father Amyot saw. But more startling\r\nrevelations were in store. The most celebrated Chinese scholar of his\r\ntime, Abel Rémusat, took up the subject; and after showing that the first\r\nof the three names had to be pronounced, not Khi, but I, he maintained\r\nthat the three syllables I Hi Wei, were meant for _Je-ho-vah_. According\r\nto him, the three characters employed in this name have no meaning in\r\nChinese; they are only signs of sounds foreign to the Chinese language;\r\nand they were intended to render the Greek Ἰαῶ, the name which, according\r\nto Diodorus Siculus, the Jews gave to their God. Rémusat goes on to remark\r\nthat Lao-tse had really rendered this Hebrew name more accurately than the\r\nGreeks, because he had preserved the aspiration of the second syllable,\r\nwhich was lost in Greek. In fact, he entertained no doubt that this word,\r\noccurring in the work of Lao-tse, proves an intellectual communication\r\nbetween the West and China, in the sixth century B. C.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the panic created by this discovery did not last long. M.\r\nStanislas Julien published in 1842 a complete translation of this\r\ndifficult book; and here all traces of the name of Jehovah have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n“The three syllables, he writes, “which Abel Rémusat considered as purely\r\nphonetic and foreign to the Chinese language, have a very clear and\r\nintelligible meaning, and have been fully explained by Chinese\r\ncommentators. The first syllable, I, means without color; the second, Hi,\r\nwithout sound or voice; the third, Wei, without body. The proper\r\ntranslation therefore is:—”\r\n\r\n“You look (for the Tao, the law) and you see it not: it is colorless.\r\n\r\n“You listen and you hear it not: it is voiceless.\r\n\r\n“You wish to touch it and you reach it not: it is without body.”\r\n\r\nUntil, therefore, some other traces can be discovered in Chinese\r\nliterature proving an intercourse between China and Judæa in the sixth\r\ncentury B. C., we can hardly be called upon to believe that the Jews\r\nshould have communicated this one name, which they hardly trusted\r\nthemselves to pronounce at home, to a Chinese philosopher; and we must\r\ntreat the apparent similarity between I-Hi-Wei and Jehovah as an accident,\r\nwhich ought to serve as a useful warning, though it need in no way\r\ndiscourage a careful and honest study of Comparative Theology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nON SPELLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remarks which I venture to offer in these pages on the corrupt state\r\nof the present spelling of English, and on the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages connected with a reform of English orthography, were written\r\nin fulfillment of a promise of very long standing. Ever since the\r\npublication of the Second Volume of my “Lectures on the Science of\r\nLanguage,” in 1863, where I had expressed my sincere admiration for the\r\ncourage and perseverance with which Mr. Isaac Pitman and some of his\r\nfriends (particularly Mr. A. J. Ellis, for six years his most active\r\nassociate) had fought the battle of a reform in English spelling, Mr.\r\nPitman had been requesting me to state more explicitly than I had done in\r\nmy “Lectures” my general approval of his life-long endeavors. He wished\r\nmore particularly that I should explain why I, though by profession an\r\netymologist, was not frightened by the specter of phonetic spelling, while\r\nsuch high authorities as Archbishop Trench and Dean Alford had declared\r\nthat phonetic spelling would necessarily destroy the historical and\r\netymological character of the English language.\r\n\r\nIf I ask myself why I put off the fulfillment of my promise from year to\r\nyear, the principal reason I find is, that really I had nothing more to\r\nsay than what, though in few words, I had said before. Every thing that\r\ncan be said on this subject has been said, and well said, not only by Mr.\r\nPitman, but by a host of writers and lecturers, among whom I might mention\r\nMr. Alexander J. Ellis, Dr. Latham, Professors Haldeman, Whitney, and\r\nHadley, Mr. Withers, Mr. E. Jones, Dr. J. H. Gladstone, and many others.\r\nThe whole matter is no longer a matter for argument; and the older I grow,\r\nthe more I feel convinced that nothing vexes people so much, and hardens\r\nthem in their unbelief and in their dogged resistance to reforms, as\r\nundeniable facts and unanswerable arguments. Reforms are carried by Time,\r\nand what generally prevails in the end, are not logical deductions, but\r\nsome haphazard and frequently irrational motives. I do not say, therefore,\r\nwith Dean Swift, that “there is a degree of corruption wherein some\r\nnations, as bad as the world is, will proceed to an amendment; till which\r\ntime particular men should be quiet.” On the contrary, I feel convinced\r\nthat practical reformers, like Mr. Pitman, should never slumber nor sleep.\r\nThey should keep their grievances before the public in season and out of\r\nseason. They should have their lamps burning, to be ready whenever the\r\nright time comes. They should repeat the same thing over and over again,\r\nundismayed by indifference, ridicule, contempt, and all the other weapons\r\nwhich the lazy world knows so well how to employ against those who venture\r\nto disturb its peace.\r\n\r\nI myself, however, am not a practical reformer; least of all in a matter\r\nwhich concerns Englishmen only—namely, the spelling of the English\r\nlanguage. I should much rather, therefore, have left the fight to others,\r\ncontent with being merely a looker-on. But when I was on the point of\r\nleaving England my conscience smote me. Though I had not actually given a\r\npledge, I remembered how, again and again, I had said to Mr. Pitman that I\r\nwould much rather keep than make a promise; and though overwhelmed with\r\nother work at the time, I felt that before my departure I ought, if\r\npossible, to satisfy Mr. Pitman’s demands. The article was written; and\r\nthough my own plans have since been changed, and I remain at Oxford, it\r\nmay as well be published in discharge of a debt which has been for some\r\ntime heavy on my conscience.\r\n\r\nWhat I wish most strongly to impress on my readers is that I do not write\r\nas an advocate. I am not an agitator for phonetic reform in England. My\r\ninterest in the matter is, and always has been, purely theoretical and\r\nscientific. Spelling and the reform of spelling are problems which concern\r\nevery student of the science of language. It does not matter whether the\r\nlanguage be English, German, or Dutch. In every written language the\r\nproblem of reforming its antiquated spelling must sooner or later arise;\r\nand we must form some clear notion whether any thing can be done to remove\r\nor alleviate a complaint inherent in the very life of language. If my\r\nfriends tell me that the idea of a reform of spelling is entirely\r\nQuixotic, that it is a mere waste of time to try to influence a whole\r\nnation to surrender its historical orthography and to write phonetically,\r\nI bow to their superior wisdom as men of the world. But as I am not a man\r\nof the world, but rather an observer of the world, my interest in the\r\nsubject, my convictions as to what is right and wrong, remain just the\r\nsame. It is the duty of scholars and philosophers not to shrink from\r\nholding and expressing what men of the world call Quixotic opinions; for,\r\nif I read the history of the world rightly, the victory of reason over\r\nunreason, and the whole progress of our race, have generally been achieved\r\nby such fools as ourselves “rushing in where angels fear to tread,” till,\r\nafter a time, the track becomes beaten, and even angels are no longer\r\nafraid. I hold, and have confessed, much more Quixotic theories on\r\nlanguage than this belief—that what has been done before by Spaniards and\r\nDutchmen—what is at this very moment being done by Germans, namely, to\r\nreform their corrupt spelling—may be achieved even by Englishmen and\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nI have expressed my belief that the time will come when not only the\r\nvarious alphabets and systems of spelling, but many of the languages\r\nthemselves which are now spoken in Europe, to say nothing of the rest of\r\nthe world, will have to be improved away from the face of the earth and\r\nabolished. Knowing that nothing rouses the ire of a Welshman or a Gael so\r\nmuch as to assert the expediency, nay, necessity, of suppressing the\r\nteaching of their languages at school, it seems madness to hint that it\r\nwould be a blessing to every child born in Holland, in Portugal, or in\r\nDenmark—nay, in Sweden and even in Russia—if, instead of learning a\r\nlanguage which is for life a barrier between them and the rest of mankind,\r\nthey were at once to learn one of the great historical languages which\r\nconfer intellectual and social fellowship with the whole world. If, as a\r\nfirst step in the right direction, four languages only, namely, English,\r\nFrench, German, Italian (or possibly Spanish) were taught at school, the\r\nsaving of time—and what is more precious than time?—would be infinitely\r\ngreater than what has been effected by railways and telegraphs. But I know\r\nthat no name in any of the doomed languages would be too strong to\r\nstigmatize such folly. We should be told that a Japanese only could\r\nconceive such an idea; that for a people deliberately to give up its\r\nlanguage was a thing never heard of before; that a nation would cease to\r\nbe a nation if it changed its language; that it would, in fact, commit\r\n“the happy despatch,” _à la Japonaise_. All this may be true, but I hold\r\nthat language is meant to be an instrument of communication, and that in\r\nthe struggle for life, the most efficient instrument of communication must\r\ncertainly carry the day, as long as natural selection, or, as we formerly\r\ncalled it, reason, rules the world.\r\n\r\nThe following figures may be of use in forming an opinion as to the fates\r\nof the great languages of Europe:(68)—\r\n\r\nPortuguese is spoken in\r\n  Portugal, by 3,980,000\r\n  Brazil, by 10,000,000\r\n  Total: 13,980,000\r\nItalian, by 27,524,238\r\nFrench, in France, Belgium, Switzerland, etc., by 40,188,000\r\nSpanish, in\r\n  Spain, by 16,301,000\r\n  South America, by 27,408,082\r\n  Total: 43,709,082\r\nRussian, by 51,370,000\r\nGerman, by 55,789,000\r\nEnglish, in\r\n  Europe, by 31,000,000\r\n  America, by 45,000,000\r\n  Australia, etc., by 2,000,000\r\n  the Colonies, by 1,050,000\r\n  Total: 79,050,000\r\n\r\nAccording to De Candolle, the population doubles in\r\n\r\nEngland, in                           56 years\r\nAmerica, among the German races, in   25 years\r\nItaly, in                             135 years\r\nRussia, in                            100 years\r\nSpain, in                             112 years\r\nSouth America, in                     27-½ years\r\nGermany, in                           100 years\r\nFrance, in                            140 years\r\n\r\nTherefore, in 200 years (barring accidents)\r\n\r\nItalian will be spoken by                       53,370,000\r\nFrench will be spoken by                        72,571,000\r\nGerman will be spoken by                        157,480,000\r\nSpanish will be spoken in\r\n  Europe, by                                    36,938,338\r\n  South America, by                             468,347,904\r\n  Total:                                        505,286,242\r\nEnglish will be spoken in\r\n  Europe, by                                    178,846,153\r\n  United States, and British Dependencies, by   1,658,440,000\r\n  Total:                                        1,837,286,153\r\n\r\nBut I shall say no more on this, for as it is, I know I shall never hear\r\nthe end of it, and shall go down to posterity, if for nothing else, at\r\nleast for this the most suicidal folly in a student of languages; a folly\r\ncomparable only to that of Leibniz, who actually conceived the possibility\r\nof one universal language.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the problem to the solution of which Mr. Pitman has\r\ndevoted the whole of his active life, let me say again that my interest in\r\nit is purely philological; or, if you like, historical. The problem which\r\nhas to be solved in England and the United States of America is not a new\r\none, nor an isolated one. It occurs again and again in the history of\r\nlanguage; in fact, it must occur. When languages are reduced to writing,\r\nthey are at first written phonetically, though always in a very\r\nrough-and-ready manner. One dialect, that of the dominant, the literary,\r\nor priestly character, is generally selected; and the spelling, once\r\nadopted, becomes in a very short time traditional and authoritative. What\r\ntook place thousands of years ago, we can see taking place, if we like, at\r\nthe present moment. A missionary from the island of Mangaia, the Rev. W.\r\nGill, first introduced the art of writing among his converts. He learned\r\ntheir language, at least one dialect of it, he translated part of the\r\nBible into it, and adopted, of necessity, a phonetic spelling. That\r\ndialect is gradually becoming the recognized literary language of the\r\nwhole island, and his spelling is taught at school. Other dialects,\r\nhowever, continue to be spoken, and they may in time influence the\r\nliterary dialect. For the present, however, the missionary dialect, as it\r\nis called by the natives themselves, and the missionary spelling, rule\r\nsupreme, and it will be some time before a spelling reform is wanted out\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAmong the more ancient nations of Europe, not only does the pronunciation\r\nof language maintain its inherent dialectic variety, and fluctuate through\r\nthe prevalence of provincial speakers, but the whole body of a language\r\nchanges, while yet the spelling, once adopted in public documents, and\r\ntaught to children, remains for a long time the same. In early times, when\r\nliterature was in its infancy, when copies of books could easily be\r\ncounted, and when the _norma scribendi_ was in the hands of a few persons,\r\nthe difficulty of adapting the writing to the ever-varying pronunciation\r\nof a language was comparatively small. We see it when we compare the Latin\r\nof early Roman inscriptions with the Latin of Cicero. We know from Cicero\r\nhimself that when he settled among the patricians of Rome, he had on some\r\nsmall points to change both his pronunciation and his spelling of Latin.\r\nThe reform of spelling was a favorite subject with Roman scholars, and\r\neven emperors were not too proud to dabble in inventing new letters and\r\ndiacritical signs. The difficulty, however, never assumes serious\r\nproportions. The small minority of people who were able to read and write,\r\npleased themselves as best they could; and, by timely concessions,\r\nprevented a complete estrangement between the written and the spoken\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThen came the time when Latin ceased to be Latin, and the vulgar dialects,\r\nsuch as Italian, French, and Spanish took its place. At that time the\r\nspelling was again phonetic, though here and there tinged by reminiscences\r\nof Latin spelling. There was much variety, but considering how limited the\r\nliterary intercourse must have been between different parts of France,\r\nSpain, or Italy, it is surprising that on the whole there should have been\r\nso much uniformity in the spelling of these modern dialects. A certain\r\nlocal and individual freedom of spelling, however, was retained; and we\r\ncan easily detect in mediæval MSS. the spelling of literate and illiterate\r\nwriters, the hand of the learned cleric, the professional clerk, and the\r\nlayman.\r\n\r\n[A style of spelling will now be introduced which has received the name of\r\nSemiphonotypy. It requires no new letter: “[D] [p]” for the vowel in\r\n_but_, _son_, are made from “D p” by a pen-knife. The short vowels,\r\ndiphthongs, and consonants are all written phonetically, except an\r\noccasional “n” = “[n]” before _k_ and _g_, and “th” = both “[t]” and\r\n“[dh]” leaving only the long vowels in the old spelling. Six syllables out\r\nof seven are thus written as in full phonotypy. The italic and script\r\nforms of “[P [italic form] ]” are “[p [italic form] ]” (a turned italic\r\n“_a_”) and [P p [script form] ].]\r\n\r\nThe great event hwich formz a deseisiv epok in the histori ov speling iz\r\nthe introd[p]kshon ov printing. With printed buks, and partikiularli with\r\nprinted Beibelz, skaterd over the k[p]ntri, the speling of w[p]rdz bekame\r\nrijid, and universali beinding. S[p]m langwejez, s[p]ch az Italian, wer\r\nmore fortiunate than [p]therz in having a more rashonal sistem ov speling\r\ntu start with. S[p]m, agen, leik Jerman, wer abel tu make teimli\r\nkonseshonz, hweil [p]therz, s[p]ch az Spanish, D[p]ch, and French, had\r\nAkademiz tu help them at kritikal periodz ov their histori. The most\r\n[p]nfortiunate in all theze respekts woz Inglish. It started with a Latin\r\nalfabet, the pron[p]nsiashon ov hwich woz [p]nseteld, and hwich had tu be\r\napleid tu a Tiutonik langwej. After this ferst fonetik kompromeiz it had\r\ntu pas through a konfiúzd sistem ov speling, half Sakson, half Norman;\r\nhalf fonetik, half tradishonal. The histori ov the speling, and even ov\r\nthe pron[p]nsiashon, ov Inglish, in its pasej from Anglo-Sakson tu midel\r\nand modern Inglish, haz lateli been st[p]did with great s[p]kses bei Mr.\r\nEllis and Mr. Sweet. Ei m[p]st refer tu their buks “On Erli Inglish\r\nPron[p]nsiashon,” and “On the Histori ov Inglish Soundz,” hwich kontain a\r\nwelth ov il[p]strashon, almost bewildering. And even after Inglish reachez\r\nthe period ov printing, the konfiuzhon iz bei no meanz terminated; on the\r\nkontrari, for a teim it iz greater than ever. Hou this kame tu pas haz\r\nbeen wel il[p]strated bei Mr. Marsh in hiz ekselent “Lektiurz on the\r\nInglish Langwej,” p. 687, _seq_.(69) Hwot we nou kall the establisht\r\nsistem ov Inglish orthografi may, in the main, be trast bak tu Jonson’z\r\nDikshonari, and tu the stil more kaprishus sway ekserseizd bei larj\r\nprinting ofisez and p[p]blisherz. It iz true that the evil ov printing\r\nkarid tu a serten ekstent its own remedi. If the speling bekame\r\n[p]nchanjabel, the langwej itself, too, woz, bei meanz ov a printed\r\nliteratiur, chekt konsiderabli in its natiural growth and its dealektik\r\nvareieti. Nevertheles Inglish haz chanjed sins the invenshon ov printing;\r\nInglish iz chanjing, though bei imperseptibel degreez, even nou; and if we\r\nkompare Inglish az spoken with Inglish az riten, they seem almost leik two\r\ndiferent langwejez; az diferent az Latin iz from Italian.\r\n\r\nThis, no dout, iz a nashonal misfortiun, but it iz inevitabel. Litel az we\r\nperseive it, langwej iz, and alwayz m[p]st be, in a state ov fermentashon;\r\nand hwether within hundredz or thouzandz ov yearz, all living langwejez\r\nm[p]st be prepared tu enkounter the difik[p]lti hwich in Ingland starez us\r\nin the fase at prezent. “Hwot shal we do?” ask our frendz. “Ther iz our\r\nhole nashonal literatiur,” they say, “our leibrariz aktiuali b[p]rsting\r\nwith buks and nuizpaperz. Ar all theze tu be thrown away? Ar all valiuabel\r\nbuks tu be reprinted? Ar we ourselvz tu [p]nlern hwot we hav lernd with so\r\nmuch tr[p]bel, and hwot we hav taught tu our children with greater\r\ntr[p]bel stil? Ar we tu sakrifeiz all that iz historikal in our langwej,\r\nand sink doun tu the low level ov the _Fonetik Nuz_?” Ei kud go on\r\nm[p]ltipleiing theze kwestionz til even thoze men ov the w[p]rld who nou\r\nhav onli a shrug ov the shoulder for the reformerz ov speling shud say,\r\n“We had no eidea hou strong our pozishon reali iz.”\r\n\r\nBut with all that, the problem remainz [p]nsolvd. Hwot ar peopel tu do\r\nhwen langwej and pron[p]nsiashon chanje, hweil their speling iz deklared\r\ntu be [p]nchanjabel? It iz, ei believ, hardli nesesari that ei shud prove\r\nhou kor[p]pt, efete, and [p]terli irrashonal the prezent sistem ov speling\r\niz, for now[p]n seemz inkleind tu denei all thát. Ei shal onli kwote,\r\ntherefor, the j[p]jment ov w[p]n man, the late Bishop Thirlwall, a man who\r\nnever uzed ekzajerated langwej. “Ei luk,” he sez “[p]pon the establisht\r\nsistem, if an aksidental k[p]stom may be so kalld, az a mas ov anomaliz,\r\nthe growth ov ignorans and chans, ekwali rep[p]gnant tu gud taste and tu\r\nkomon sens. B[p]t ei am aware that the p[p]blik kling tu theze anomaliz\r\nwith a tenasiti proporshond tu their abs[p]rditi, and ar jel[p]s ov all\r\nenkroachment on ground konsekrated tu the free play ov bleind kaprise.”\r\n\r\nIt may be useful, houever, tu kwote the testimonialz ov a fiu praktikal\r\nmen in order tu show that this sistem ov speling haz reali bek[p]m w[p]n\r\nov the greatest nashonal misfortiunz, swolowing [p]p milionz ov m[p]ni\r\neveri year and bleiting all atempts at nashonal ediukashon. Mr. Edward\r\nJones, a skoolmaster ov great eksperiens, having then siuperintendens ov\r\nthe Heibernian Skoolz, Liverpool, rote, in the year 1868:\r\n\r\n“The G[p]vernment haz for the last twenti yearz taken ediukashon [p]nder\r\nits kare. They diveided the subjekts ov instr[p]kshon intu siks gradez.\r\nThe heiest point that woz atempted in the G[p]vernment Skoolz woz that a\r\npiupil shud be abel tu read with tolerabel eaze and ekspreshon a pasej\r\nfrom a niuzpaper, and tu spel the same with a tolerabel amount ov\r\nakiurasi.”\r\n\r\nLet [p]s luk at the rez[p]lts az they apear in the report ov the Komíti ov\r\nKounsil on Ediukashon for 1870-71:\r\n\r\nSkoolz or Departments [p]nder separate hed teacherz in Ingland and Walez\r\ninspekted diuring the year 31st August, 1870, 15,287\r\nSertifikated asistant, and piupil  teacherz emploid in theze skoolz,\r\n28,033\r\nSkolarz in daili averej atendans throughout the year, 1,168,981\r\nSkolarz prezent on the day ov inspekshon, 1,473,883\r\nSkolarz prezented for ekzaminashon:\r\n  [P]nder ten yearz ov aje, 473,444\r\n  Over ten yearz ov aje, 292,144\r\n  Total: 765,588\r\nSkolarz prezented for Standard VI.:\r\n  [P]nder ten yearz ov aje, 227\r\n  Over ten yearz ov aje, 32,953\r\n  Total: 33,180\r\nSkolarz who past in Standard VI.:\r\n  1.

Ferst ov all, ther ought tu\r\nhav been at skool 4,600,000 children between the ajez ov three and\r\ntherteen. The number ov children on the rejister ov inspekted skoolz woz\r\n2,218,598. Out ov thát number, about 200,000 leav skool aniuali, their\r\nediukashon beïng supozed tu be finisht. Out ov theze 200,000, neinti per\r\nsent. leav without reaching the 6th Standard, eighti per sent. without\r\nreaching the 5th, and siksti per sent. without reaching the 4th Standard.\r\n\r\nThe report for 1874-75 showz an inkreas ov children on the buks, b[p]t the\r\nproporshon ov children pasing in the vari[p]s standardz iz s[p]bstanshali\r\nthe same. (See “Popiular Ediukashon,” bei E. Jones, B.A., an\r\neks-skoolmaster, 1875.) It iz kalkiulated that for such rezults az theze\r\nthe k[p]ntri, hwether bei taksashon or bei voluntari kontribiushonz, payz\r\nnearli £3,500,000 aniuali.\r\n\r\nAkording tu the same authoriti, Mr. E. Jones, it nou takes from siks tu\r\nseven yearz tu lern the arts ov reading and speling with a fair degree ov\r\nintelijens—thát iz, about 2,000 ourz; and tu meni meindz the difik[p]ltiz\r\nov orthografi ar ins[p]rmountabel. The bulk ov the children pas through\r\nthe G[p]vernment skoolz without having akweird the abiliti tu read with\r\neaze and intelijens.\r\n\r\n“An averej cheild,” sez anuthcr skoolmaster, “begining skool at seven,\r\nought tu be abel tu read the Niu Testament fluentli at eleven or twelv\r\nyearz ov aje, and at therteen or fourteen ought tu be abel tu read a gud\r\nleading artikel with eaze and ekspreshon.” That iz, with seven ourz a week\r\nfor forti weeks for feiv yearz, a cheild rekweirz 1,400 ourz’ w[p]rk, tu\r\nbe abel tu read the Niu Testament.\r\n\r\nAfter a kareful ekzaminashon ov y[p]ng men and wimen from therteen tu\r\ntwenti yearz ov aje in the faktoriz ov Birmingham, it woz proved that onli\r\n4-½ per sent. wer abel tu read a simpel sentens from an ordinari skool-buk\r\nwith intelijens and akiurasi.\r\n\r\nThis apleiz tu the lower klasez. B[p]t with regard tu the heier klasez the\r\nkase seemz almost w[p]rs; for Dr. Morell, in hiz “Maniual ov Speling,”\r\naserts that out ov 1,972 failiurz in the Sivil Servis Ekzaminashonz 1,866\r\nkandidates wer pl[p]kt for speling.\r\n\r\nSo much for the piupilz. Am[p]ng the teacherz themselvz it woz found in\r\nAmerika that out ov w[p]n h[p]ndred komon w[p]rdz the best speler am[p]ng\r\nthe eighti or neinti teacherz ekzamind faild in w[p]n, s[p]m preiz-takerz\r\nfaild in four or feiv, and s[p]m [p]therz mist over forti. The Depiuti\r\nState Siuperintendent deklared that on an averej the teacherz ov the State\r\nwud fail in speling tu the ekstent ov 25 per sent.\r\n\r\nHwot, houever, iz even more seri[p]s than all this iz not the great waste\r\nov teim in lerning tu read, and the almost komplete failiur in nashonal\r\nediukashon, but the aktiual mischef d[p]n bei s[p]bjekting y[p]ng meindz\r\ntu the illojikal and tedi[p]s dr[p]jeri ov lerning tu read Inglish az\r\nspeld at prezent. Everithing they hav tu lern in reading (or\r\npron[p]nsiashon) and speling iz irrashonal; w[p]n rule kontradikts the\r\n[p]ther, and each statement haz tu be aksepted simpli on authoriti, and\r\nwith a komplete disregard ov all thoze rashonal instinkts which lei\r\ndormant in the cheild, and ought tu be awakend bei everi keind ov helthi\r\nekserseiz.\r\n\r\nEi nó ther ar personz who kan defend enithing, and who hold that it iz diu\r\ntu this veri disiplin that the Inglish karakter iz hwot it iz; that it\r\nretainz respekt for authoriti; that it d[p]z not rekweir a reazon for\r\neverithing; and that it duz not admit that hwot iz inkonseivabel iz\r\ntherefor imposibel. Even Inglish orthodoksi haz been trast bak tu thát\r\nhiden sourse, bekauz a cheild akustomd tu believe that t-h-o-u-g-h iz\r\n_tho_, and that t-h-r-o-u-g-h iz _throo_, w[p]d afterwardz believe\r\nenithing. It may be so; stil ei dout hwether even such objekts wud\r\njustifei s[p]ch meanz. Lord Lytton sez, “A more leiing, round-about,\r\np[p]zel-heded deluzhon than thát bei hwich we konfiúz the klear instinkts\r\nov truth in our ak[p]rsed sistem ov speling woz never konkokted bei the\r\nfather ov fol·shud.... Hou kan a sistem ov ediukashon fl[p]rish that\r\nbeginz bei so monstr[p]s a fols·hud, hwich the sens ov hearing s[p]feisez\r\ntu kontradikt?”\r\n\r\nThough it may seem a w[p]rk ov siupererogashon tu bring forward stil more\r\nfakts in s[p]port ov the jeneral kondemnashon past on Inglish speling, a\r\nfiu ekstrakts from a pamflet bei Mr. Meiklejohn, late Asistant-Komishoner\r\nov the Endoud Skoolz Komishon for Skotland, may here feind a plase.\r\n\r\n“Ther ar therteen diferent wayz ov reprezenting the sound ov long\r\n_o_:—_note_, _boat_, _toe_, _yeoman_, _soul_, _row_, _sew_, _hautboy_,\r\n_beau_, _owe_, _floor_, _oh!_, _O!_”\r\n\r\nAnd agen (p. 16),\r\n\r\n“Double-you-aitch-eye-see-aitch is _which_\r\nTea-are-you-tea-aitch is _truth_\r\nBee-o-you-gee-aitch is _bough_\r\nSee-are-eh-bee is _crab_\r\nBee-ee-eh-see-aitch is _beach_\r\nOh-you-gee-aitch-tee is _ought_\r\nOh-enn-see-ee is _once_\r\n\r\n“Or, tu sum up the hole indeitment agenst the kulprit: 1.

The prinsipel that haf a loaf iz beter than no bred iz not without\r\ns[u]m tru[t], and in meni kasez we nó that a polisi ov kompromeiz haz been\r\nprod[u]ktiv ov veri gud rez[u]lts. B[u]t, on the [u]ther hand, this\r\nhaf-harted polisi haz often retarded a real and komplete reform ov\r\nekzisti[n] abiúsez; and in the kase ov a reform ov speli[n], ei almost\r\ndout hwether the difik[u]ltiz inherent in haf-me[z]urz ar not az great az\r\nthe difik[u]ltiz ov karii[n] a komplete reform. If the w[u]rld iz not redi\r\nfor reform, let [u]s wait. It seemz far beter, and at all events far more\r\nonest, tu wait til it iz redi than tu kari the rel[u]ktant wurld with you\r\na litel way, and then tu feind that all the impulsiv forse iz spent, and\r\nthe greater part ov the abiúsez establisht on fermer ground than ever.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones,(70) who reprezents the konsiliatori reformerz ov speli[n], wud\r\nbe satisfeid with a moderet skeme ov speli[n] reform, in hwich, bei\r\nobzervi[n] analoji and folowi[n] presedent in olteri[n] a komparativli\r\nsmall n[u]mber ov w[u]rdz, it wud be posibel tu simplifei ortografi tu a\r\nkonsiderabel ekstent without apleii[n] eni niu prinsipel, or introdiúsi[n]\r\nniu leterz, and yet tu rediús the teim and labor in teachi[n] readi[n] and\r\nspeli[n] bei at least w[u]n-haf. It meit at all events be posibel tu setel\r\nthe speli[n] ov thoze two or three touzand w[u]rdz hwich at prezent ar\r\nspeld diferentli bei diferent au[t]oritiz. This skeme, advokated bei Mr.\r\nJones, iz sertenli veri klever; and if it had a chans ov s[u]kses, ei\r\nmeiself shud konsider it a great step in adváns. Mei onli dout iz hwether,\r\nin a kase leik this, a small me[z]ur ov reform wud be karid more eazili\r\nthan a komplete reform. It iz diferent in Jerman, hwere the diseaz haz not\r\nspred so far. Here the Komíti apointed bei G[u]vernment tu konsider the\r\nkwestion ov a reform ov speli[n] haz deklared in favor ov s[u]m s[u]ch\r\nmoderet prinsipelz az Mr. Jones advokates for I[n]glish. In I[n]glish,\r\nhouever, the difik[u]ti leiz in chanji[n] eni[t]i[n]; and if the prinsipel\r\nov eni chanje iz w[u]ns admited, it wud reali be eazier, ei believ, tu\r\nbegin _de novo_ than tu chanje s[u]m[t]i[n], and leav the rest\r\n[u]nchanjed.\r\n\r\nLet [u]s nou see hou Mr. Pitman’z or eni similar sistem ov fonetik\r\nreiti[n] haz w[u]rkt hwere it haz been put tu the test.\r\n\r\nMr. William White reits: “Ei speak from eksperiens. Ei hav taught poor\r\nchildren in Glasgow tu read the Sermon on the Mount after a kourse ov\r\nekserseizez ekstendi[n] over no more than siks ourz.”\r\n\r\nThe folowi[n] iz an ekstrakt from a leter riten s[u]m teim ago bei the\r\nlate Mr. William Colbourne, manajer ov the Dorset Ba[n]k at St[u]rminster,\r\ntu a frend ov hiz a skoolmaster. He sez:—\r\n\r\n“Mei litel Sidney, who iz nou a fiu m[u]n[t]s more than four yearz old,\r\nwil read eni fonetik buk without the sleitest hezitashon; the hardest\r\nnamez or the lo[n]gest w[u]rdz in the Old or Niu Testament form no\r\nobstakel tu him. And hou lo[n] do you [t]ink it tuk me (for ei am hiz\r\nteacher) tu impart tu him this pouer? Hwei s[u]m[t]i[n] les than eight\r\nourz! You may believ it or not, az you leik, b[u]t ei am konfident that\r\nnot more than that amount ov teim woz spent on him, and that woz in\r\nsnachez ov feiv minits at a teim, hweil tea woz geti[n] redi. Ei no you\r\nwil be inkleind tu say, ‘All that iz veri wel, b[u]t hwot iz the use ov\r\nreadi[n] fonetik buks? he iz stil az far of, and may be farther, from\r\nreadi[n] romanik buks.’ B[u]t in this you ar mistaken. Take an[u]ther\r\nekzampel. Hiz nekst elder br[u]ther, a boi ov siks yearz, haz had a\r\nfonetik ediukashon so far. Hwot iz the konsekwens? Hwei, readin in the\r\nferst staje woz so deleitful and eazi a [t]i[n] tu him that he taught\r\nhimself tu read romanikali, and it wud be a difik[u]lt mater tu feind\r\nw[u]n boi in twenti, ov a korespondi[n] aje, that kud read haf so wel az\r\nhe kan in eni buk. Agen, mei oldest boi haz riten more fonetik shorthand\r\nand lo[n]hand, perhaps, than eni boi ov hiz aje (eleven yearz) in the\r\nki[n]dom; and now[u]n ei daresay haz had les tu do with that abs[u]rditi\r\nov abs[u]rditiz, the speli[n]-buk! He iz nou at a ferst-rate skool in\r\nWiltshire, and in the haf-year presedi[n] Kristmas, he karid of the preiz\r\nfor or[t]ografi in a kontest with boiz s[u]m ov them hiz seniorz bei\r\nyearz!”\r\n\r\nBei the adopshon ov the fonetik alfabet, the difik[u]ltiz that lei in the\r\nway ov forenerz lerni[n] I[n]glish, also wud be d[u]n away with. The Rev.\r\nNewman Hall reits, “Ei met with a Danish jentelman the [u]ther day who\r\nheili preizd the I[n]glish fonotipik Niu Testament. It had been ov great\r\nuse tu him, and _enabeld him tu read [buks in the komon speli[n]] without\r\nan instr[u]kter_, removi[n] the greatest obstakel in akweiri[n] I[n]glish,\r\nthe monstr[u]s anomali[z] ov pron[u]nsiashon.” Ekzampelz leik theze go a\r\nlo[n] way.\r\n\r\nMr. A. J. Ellis, than whom now[u]n haz labord more devotidli for a reform\r\nov speli[n], az a ferst step in a reform ov nashonal ediukashon, and who\r\nhaz himself elaborated several most injeni[u]s sistemz ov fonetik\r\nreiti[n], givz [u]s the folowi[n] az the rez[u]ltz ov hiz praktikal\r\neksperiens:\r\n\r\n“With the fonetik sistem ov speli[n], the Primer iz masterd within tree\r\nm[u]n[t]s at most. The children then proseed tu praktis this fonetik\r\nreadi[n] for s[u]m teim, til they kan read with fluensi from the jeneral\r\nluk ov the w[u]rd, and not from konsideri[n] the pouerz ov its leterz.\r\n[T]ree m[u]n[t]s more, at most, ar rekweird for this staje.\r\n\r\n“Hwen this pouer ov fluent readi[n] in fonetik print iz akweird, buks in\r\nthe ordinari print, suited tu their kapasitiz, ar tu be put intu the\r\nchildren’z handz and they ar told tu read them. Each w[u]rd hwich they\r\nfail tu ges iz told them immedietli; but it iz found that children ar\r\nmostli abel tu read the ordinari print without eni f[u]rther\r\ninstr[u]kshon. The teim nesesari for kompleti[n] this step may be taken,\r\nat the lo[n]gest, az two m[u]n[t]s, so that the hole teim ov lerni[n] tu\r\nread in the ordinari print, on the Readi[n] Reform sistem, may be rekond\r\naz feiv ourz a week for eight m[u]n[t]s. The hole task haz, in meni kasez,\r\nbeen akomplisht in les teim, even in [t]ree m[u]n[t]s.

That thoze taught tu read in this maner akweir the art ov ordinari\r\nspeli[n] more redili than thoze instr[u]kted on the old me[t]od.”\r\n\r\nTu all who no Mr. A. J. Ellis, this evidens wil be be s[u]fishent az tu\r\nthe praktikal usefulnes ov the Fonetik Sistem ov speli[n]. Tu thoze who\r\nwish for more evidens ei rekomend a pamflet bei Mr. G. Withers, “The\r\nI[n]glish La[n]gwej Speld az Pronounst,” 1874; and w[u]n bei Dr. J. W.\r\nMartin, “The Gordian Not K[u]t,” 1875, hwere they wil feind the\r\nkonk[u]rent testimoni ov praktikal teacherz in I[n]gland, Skotland,\r\nEirland, and Amerika, all agreei[n] that, bo[t] az a praktikal and a\r\nlojikal traini[n], the Fonetik Sistem haz proved the greatest s[u]kses.\r\n\r\nTher remainz, therefor, this w[u]n objekshon onli, that hwotever the\r\npraktikal, and hwotever the [t]eoretikal advantejez ov the fonetik sistem\r\nmay be, it wud [u]terli destroi the historikal or etimolojikal karakter ov\r\nthe I[n]glish la[n]gwej.\r\n\r\nS[u]poze it did; hwot then? The Reformashon iz s[u]pozed tu hav destroid\r\nthe historikal karakter ov the I[n]glish Ch[u]rch, and that sentimental\r\ngrievans iz stil felt bei s[u]m stiudents ov ekleziastikal antikwitiz.\r\nB[u]t did I[n]gland, did all the reali progresiv nashonz ov Europe, alou\r\nthis sentimental grievans tu outweigh the praktikal and [t]eoretikal\r\nadvantejez ov Protestant Reform? La[n]gwej iz not made for skolarz and\r\netimolojists; and if the hole rase ov I[n]glish etimolojists wer reali tu\r\nbe swept away bei the introd[u]kshon ov a Speli[n] Reform, ei hope they\r\nwud be the ferst tu rejois in sakrifeizi[n] themselvz in so gud a kauz.\r\n\r\nB[u]t iz it reali the kase that the historikal kontiniúiti ov the\r\nI[n]glish la[n]gwej wud bei broken bei the adopshon ov fonetik speli[n],\r\nand that the profeshon ov the etimolojist wud be gon for ever? Ei say No,\r\nmost emfatikali, tu bo[t] propozishonz. If the seiens ov la[n]gwej haz\r\nproved eni[t]i[n], it haz proved that all la[n]gwejez chanje akordi[n] tu\r\nlaw, and with konsiderabel uniformiti. If, therefor, the reiti[n] folowd\r\n_pari passu_, on the chanjez in pron[u]nsiashon, hwot iz kalld the\r\netimolojikal konsh[u]snes ov the speakerz and the readerz—ei speak, ov\r\nkourse, ov ediukated peopel onli—wud not s[u]fer in the least. If we\r\nretain the feeli[n] ov an etimolojikal konekshon between _gentlemanly_ and\r\n_gentlemanlike_, we shud shureli retain it hwether we reit _gentlemanly_\r\nor _gentelmanli_. If we feel that _think_ and _thought_, _bring_ and\r\n_brought_, buy and _bought_, _freight_ and _fraught_, belo[n] tugether,\r\nshud we feel it les if we rote _t[w]t_, _br[w]t_, _b[w]t_, _fr[w]t_? If,\r\nin speaki[n], thoze who no Latin retain the feeli[n] that w[u]rdz endin in\r\n-_ation_ korespond tu Latin w[u]rdz in -_atio_, wud they looz the feeli[n]\r\nif they saw the same w[u]rdz speld with _[e][sh]on_, or even “-e[sh][u]n?”\r\nDo they not rekogneiz Latin -_itia_, in -_ice_; or -_ilis_ in -_le_, az in\r\n-_able_ (Latin _abilis_)? If the skolar noz, at w[u]ns, that s[u]ch\r\nw[u]rdz az _barbarous_, _anxious_, _circus_, _genius_, ar ov Latin\r\noriji[n], wud he hezitate if the last silabel in all ov them wer uniformli\r\nriten “[u]s?” Nay, iz not the prezent speli[n] ov _barbarous_ and\r\n_anxious_ enteirli misleadi[n], bei konfoundi[n] w[u]rdz endi[n] in\r\n_-osus_, s[u]ch az _famous_ (_famosus_) with w[u]rdz endi[n] in _-us_,\r\nleik _barbarous_, _anxious_, ets.? Bekauz the Italianz reit _filosofo_, ar\r\nthey les aware than the I[n]glish, who reit _philosopher_, and the French,\r\nwho reit _philosophe_, that they hav before them the Latin _philosophus_,\r\nthe Greek φιλόσοφος? If we reit _f_ in _fansi_, hwei not in _phantom_? If\r\nin _frenzy_ and _frantic_, hwei not in _phrenology_? A la[n]gwej hwich\r\ntolerates _vial_ for _phial_, need not shiver at _filosofer_. Everi\r\neidiukated speaker nóz that s[u]ch w[u]rdz az _honour_, _ardour_,\r\n_colour_, _odour_, _labour_, _vigour_, _error_, _emperor_, hav past from\r\nLatin tu French, and from French tu I[n]glish. Wud he nó it les if all wer\r\nspeld aleik, s[u]ch az _onor_ (_onorable_), _ardor_, _vigor_ (_vigorous_),\r\n_labor_ (_laborious_), or even “on[u]r, ard[u]r, vig[u]r?” The old\r\nspeli[n] ov _emperor_, _doctor_, _governor_, and _error_, woz _emperour_,\r\n_doctour_, _governour_, and _errour_. If theze kud be chanjed, hwei not\r\nthe rest? Spenser haz _neibor_ for _neighbor_, and it iz difik[u]lt tu say\r\nhwot woz gaind bei chanji[n] _-bor_ intu _-bour_ in s[u]ch piurli Sakson\r\nw[u]rdz az _neighbor_, _harbor_. No dout if we see _laugh_ riten with _gh_\r\nat the end, thoze who nó Jerman ar at w[u]ns remeinded ov its etimolojikal\r\nkonekshon with the Jerman _lachen_; b[u]t we shud soon nó the same bei\r\nanaloji, if we found not onli “laf,” b[u]t “kof” for _cough_ (Jerman,\r\n_keuchen_), en[u]f for _enough_ (Jerman, _genug_), ets. In “draft,”\r\nfonetik speli[n] haz nearli s[u]planted the so-kalld historikal speli[n]\r\n_draught_; in “dwarf” (_dwergh_, _thweorh_) and in “ruff” (_rough_),\r\naltugether.\r\n\r\nHwot peopel kall the etimolojikal konsh[u]snes ov the speaker iz striktli\r\na mater ov oratorikal sentiment onli, and it wud remain nearli az stro[n]\r\naz it iz nou, hwotever speli[n] be adopted. B[u]t even if it shud s[u]fer\r\nhere and there, we ought tu bear in meind that, eksept for oratorikal\r\np[u]rposez, that konsh[u]snes, konfeind az it iz tu a veri fiu ediukated\r\npeopel, iz ov veri small importans, [u]nles it haz ferst been korekted bei\r\na strikt etimolojikal disiplin. Without that, it often dejenerates intu\r\nhwot iz kalld “popiular etimoloji,” and aktiuali tendz, in s[u]m kasez, tu\r\nvishiate the korekt speli[n] ov w[u]rdz.\r\n\r\nEi hav frekwentli dwelt on this before, in order tu show hou, hwot iz nou\r\nkalld the etimolojikal or historikal speli[n] ov w[u]rdz iz, in meni\r\nkasez, [u]terli [u]netimolojikal and [u]nhistorikal. We spel to _delight_,\r\nand th[u]s indiús meni peopel tu believ that this w[u]rd iz s[u]mhou\r\nkonekted with _light_ [lux], or _light_ [levis]; hwereaz the old speli[n]\r\nwoz _to delyt_ or to _delite_ (Tyndale), reprezenti[n] the old French\r\n_deleiter_. On the [u]ther hand, we feind for _quite_ and _smite_, the old\r\nspeli[n] _quight_, _smight_, hwich may be old and historikal, b[u]t iz\r\ndeseidedli [u]netimolojikal.\r\n\r\n_Sovereign_ and _foreign_ ar speld az if they wer konekted with _reign_,\r\n_regnum_; the true etimoloji ov the former beï[n] _superanus_, Old French,\r\n_sovrain_, Old I[n]glish, _soveraine_; hweil _foreign_ iz the late Latin\r\n_foraneus_; Old French _forain_; Old I[n]glish _forein_. And hwei du we\r\nreit _to feign_? Archbishop Trench (“I[n]glish Past and Prezent,” p. 238)\r\n[t]i[n]ks the _g_ in _feign_ iz elokwent tu the eí; b[u]t its elokwens iz\r\nmisleadi[n]. _Feign_ iz not taken from Latin _fingo_, az litel az _honour_\r\niz taken from Latin _honor_. _Feign_ k[u]mz from the Old French _faindre_;\r\nit woz in Old I[n]glish _faynen_ and _feynen_, and it woz therefor a mere\r\netimolojikal feint tu insert the _g_ ov the Latin _fingo_, and the French\r\n_feignant_. The Old I[n]glish _shammfasst_ (Orm.), formd leik _stedefasst_\r\n(stedfast), iz nou speld _shamefaced_, az if it had s[u]m[t]i[n] tu do\r\nwith a bl[u]shi[n] fase. _Aghast_, insted ov Old I[n]glish _agast_, iz\r\ns[u]pozed tu luk more freitful bekauz it remeindz [u]s ov _ghost_. The\r\nFrench _lanterne_ woz riten _lant-horn_, az if it had been so kalld from\r\nthe transparent sheets ov horn that enklozed the leit. The _s_ in _island_\r\nowez its orijin tu a mistaken belief that the w[u]rd iz konekted with\r\n_isle_ (_insula_), hwereaz it iz the A[n]glo-Sakson _eáland_ (Jerman\r\n_eiland_), that iz, water-land. The speli[n] _iland_ woz stil k[u]rent in\r\nShakspere’z teim. In _aisle_, too, the _s_ iz [u]netimolojikal, though it\r\niz historikal, az havi[n] been taken over from the Old French _aisle_.\r\n\r\nThis tendensi tu olter the speli[n] in order tu impart tu a w[u]rd, at all\r\nhazardz, an etimolojikal karakter, beginz even in Latin, hwere _postumus_,\r\na siuperlativ ov _post_, woz s[u]mteimz riten _posthumus_, az if, hwen\r\napleid tu a late-born s[u]n, it woz dereivd from _humus_. In I[n]glish,\r\nthis fols speli[n] iz retaind in _posthumous_. _Cena_ woz speld bei peopel\r\nwho wonted tu show their nolej ov Greek _cœna_, az if konekted with κοινή,\r\nhwich it iz not.\r\n\r\nB[u]t nou let [u]s luk more karefuli intu the far more important\r\nstatement, that the I[n]glish la[n]gwej, if riten fonetikali, wud reali\r\nlooz its historikal and etimolojikal karakter. The ferst kwestion iz, in\r\nhwot sens kan the prezent speli[n] ov I[n]glish be kalld historikal? We\r\nhav onli tu go bak a veri short way in order tu see the modern [u]pstart\r\nkarakter ov hwot iz kalld historikal speli[n]. We nou reit _pleasure_,\r\n_measure_, and _feather_, b[u]t not veri lo[n] ago, in Spenser’z teim,\r\ntheze w[u]rdz wer speld _plesure_, _mesure_, _fether_. Tyndale rote\r\n_frute_; the _i_ in _fruit_ iz a mere restorashon ov the French speli[n].\r\nFor _debt_, on the kontrari, we feind, b[u]t [t]ree or four h[u]ndred\r\nyearz ago, _dett_. This iz more historikal therefor than _debt_, bekauz in\r\nFrench, from hwich the w[u]rd woz borowd, the _b_ had disapeard, and it\r\nwoz a piurli etimolojikal fansi tu restore it. The _b_ woz leikweiz\r\nre-introdiúst in _doubt_, b[u]t the _p_ woz not restored in _tu kount_\r\n(French _compter_, Latin _computare_), hwere _p_ had at least the same\r\nreit az _b_ in _doute_. Th[u]s _receipt_ reziúmz the Latin _p_, b[u]t\r\n_deceit_ d[u]z without it. Tu _deign_ keeps the _g_, tu _disdain_ d[u]z\r\nwithout it. Ther iz an[u]ther _b_ hwich haz a serten historikal air in\r\ns[u]m I[n]glish w[u]rdz, b[u]t hwich woz orijinali piurli fonetik, and iz\r\nnou simpli siupérflu[u]s. The old w[u]rd for _member_ woz _lim_. In s[u]ch\r\nkompoundz az _lim-lama_, lim(b)-lame; _lim-leas_, lim(b)-less; it woz\r\nimposibel tu avoid the interkalashon ov a _b_ in pron[u]nsiashon. In this\r\nmaner the _b_ krept in, and we hav nou tu teach that in _limb_, _crumb_\r\n(crume), _thumb_ (thuma), the _b_ m[u]st be riten, b[u]t not pronoúnst.\r\nAgen, _tung_ (Jerman _zunge_), _yung_ (Jerman _jung_), az speld bei\r\nSpenser, hav a far more historikal aspekt than _tongue_ and _young_.\r\n\r\nIf we wisht tu reit historikali, we ought tu reit _salm_ insted ov\r\n_psalm_, for the inishal _p_, beï[n] lost in pron[u]nsiashon, woz dropt in\r\nreiti[n] at a veri erli teim (A[n]glo-Sakson _sealm_), and woz\r\nre-introdiúst simpli tu pleaz s[u]m ekleziastikal etimolojists; also\r\n_nevew_ (French _neveu_) insted ov _nephew_, hwich iz both\r\n[u]netimolojikal and [u]nfonetik.\r\n\r\nIn hwot sens kan it be kalld historikal speli[n] if the old pluralz ov\r\n_mouse_ and _louse_, hwich wer _mys_ and _lys_, ar nou speld _mice_ and\r\n_lice_? The plural ov _goose_ iz not speld _geece_ b[u]t _geese_, yet\r\neveribodi nóz hou tu pronoúns it.

Both k[u]m from the same sourse, the Go[t]ik _hail-s_,\r\nSanskrit _kalya-s_, meani[n] orijinali, _fit_, _redi_; then _sound_,\r\n_complete_, _whole_.

While many books on Indian\r\nliterature, published five-and-twenty years ago, are now put aside and\r\nforgotten, Julien’s three volumes of Hiouen-thsang still maintain a fresh\r\ninterest, and supply new subjects for discussion, as may be seen even in\r\nthe last number of the Journal of your Society.\r\n\r\nI had the honor and pleasure of working with Stanislas Julien, when he was\r\ncompiling those large lists of Sanskrit and Chinese words which formed the\r\nfoundation of his translation of Hiouen-thsang, and enabled him in his\r\nclassical work, the “Méthode pour déchiffrer et transcrire les noms\r\nSanskrits” (1861), to solve a riddle which had puzzled Oriental scholars\r\nfor a long time—viz., how it happened that the original Sanskrit names had\r\nbeen so completely disguised and rendered almost unrecognizable in the\r\nChinese translations of Sanskrit texts, and how they could be restored to\r\ntheir original form.\r\n\r\nI had likewise the honor and pleasure of working with your late President,\r\nProfessor H. H. Wilson, when, after reading Julien’s works, he conceived\r\nthe idea that some of the original Sanskrit texts of which the Chinese\r\ntranslations had been recovered might still be found in the monasteries of\r\nChina. His influential position as President of your Society, and his\r\npersonal relations with Sir John Bowring, then English Resident in China,\r\nenabled him to set in motion a powerful machinery for attaining his\r\nobject; and if you look back some five-and-twenty years, you will find in\r\nyour Journal a full account of the correspondence that passed between\r\nProfessor Wilson, Sir J. Bowring, and Dr. Edkins, on the search after\r\nSanskrit MSS. in the temples or monasteries of China.\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 1854, Professor Wilson writes from Oxford to Sir John\r\nBowring:—\r\n\r\n“I send you herewith a list of the Sanskrit works carried to China by Hwen\r\nTsang in the middle of the seventh century, and in great part translated\r\nby him, or under his supervision, into Chinese. If any of them,\r\n_especially the originals_, should be still in existence, you would do\r\ngood service to Sanskrit literature and to the history of Buddhism by\r\nprocuring copies.”\r\n\r\n_Chinese Translators of Sanskrit Texts._\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that, even long before the time of\r\nHiouen-thsang—that is, long before the seventh century of our era—large\r\nnumbers of Sanskrit MSS. had been exported to China. These literary\r\nexportations began as early as the first century A. D. When we read for\r\nthe first time of commissioners being sent to India by Ming-ti, the\r\nEmperor of China, the second sovereign of the Eastern Han dynasty, about\r\n62 or 65 A. D., we are told that they returned to China with a white\r\nhorse, carrying books and images.(72) And the account proceeds to state\r\nthat “these books still remain, and are reverenced and worshipped.”\r\n\r\nFrom that time, when Buddhism was first officially recognized in\r\nChina,(73) there is an almost unbroken succession of importers and\r\ntranslators of Buddhist, in some cases of Brahmanic texts also, till we\r\ncome to the two famous expeditions, the one undertaken by Fa-hian in\r\n400-415, the other by Hiouen-thsang, 629-645 A. D. Fa-hian’s Travels were\r\ntranslated into French by Abel Rémusat (1836), into English by Mr. Beal\r\n(1869). Hiouen-thsang’s Travels are well known through Stanislas Julien’s\r\nadmirable translation. Of Hiouen-thsang we are told that he brought back\r\nfrom India no less than 520 fasciculi, or 657 separate works, which had to\r\nbe carried by twenty-two horses.(74) He translated, or had translated, 740\r\nworks, forming 1,335 fasciculi.\r\n\r\nI say nothing of earlier traces of Buddhism which are supposed to occur in\r\nChinese books. Whatever they may amount to, we look in vain in them for\r\nevidence of any Chinese translations of Buddhist books before the time of\r\nthe Emperor Ming-ti; and what concerns us at present is, not the existence\r\nor the spreading of Buddhism towards the north and east long before the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era, but the existence of Buddhist books, so\r\nfar as it can be proved at that time by the existence of Chinese\r\ntranslations the date of which can be fixed with sufficient certainty.\r\n\r\nIn the following remarks on the history of these translations I have had\r\nthe great advantage of being able to use the Annals of the Sui Dynasty\r\n(589-618), kindly translated for me by Professor Legge. In China the\r\nhistory of each dynasty was written under the succeeding dynasty from\r\ndocuments which may be supposed to be contemporaneous with the events they\r\nrelate. The account given in the Sui Chronicles of the introduction of\r\nBuddhism and Buddhist works into China is said to be the best general\r\naccount to be found in early Chinese literature, and the facts here stated\r\nmay be looked upon as far more trustworthy than the notices hitherto\r\nrelied upon, and collected from Chinese writers of different dates and\r\ndifferent localities. I have also had the assistance of Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio,\r\nwho compared the names of the translators mentioned in the Sui Annals with\r\nthe names as given in the K’ai-yuen-shih-kiao-mu-lu (Catalogue of the\r\nBuddhist books compiled in the period K’ai-yuen [A. D. 713-741]); and\r\nthough there still remain some doubtful points, we may rest assured that\r\nthe dates assigned to the principal Chinese translators and their works\r\ncan be depended on as historically trustworthy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the period anterior to Ming-ti, the Sui Chronicles tell us\r\nthat after an investigation of the records, it was known that Buddhism had\r\nnot been brought to China previously to the Han dynasty (began 206 B. C.),\r\nthough some say that it had long been spread abroad, but had disappeared\r\nagain in the time of the _Kh_in(75) (221-206 B. C.). Afterwards, however,\r\nwhen _K_ang-_kh_ien was sent on a mission to the regions of the West\r\n(about 130 B. C.), he is supposed to have become acquainted with the\r\nreligion of Buddha. He was made prisoner by the Hiungnu (Huns),(76) and,\r\nbeing kept by them for ten years, he may well have acquired during his\r\ncaptivity some knowledge of Buddhism, which at a very early time had\r\nspread from Cabul(77) towards the north and the east.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Emperor Âi (B. C. 6-2) we read that _Kh_in-_k_ing\r\ncaused I-tsun to teach the Buddhist Sûtras orally, but that the people\r\ngave no credence to them. All this seems to rest on semi-historical\r\nevidence only.\r\n\r\nThe first official recognition of Buddhism in China dates from the reign\r\nof the Emperor Ming-ti, and the following account, though not altogether\r\nfree from a legendary coloring, is generally accepted as authentic by\r\nChinese scholars: “The Emperor Ming-ti, of the After Han dynasty (58-75 A.\r\nD.), dreamt that a man of metal (or golden color) was flying and walking\r\nin a courtyard of the palace. When he told his dream in the Court, Fu-î\r\nsaid that the figure was that of Buddha. On this the Emperor sent the\r\ngentleman-usher Tsâi-yin and _Kh_in-_k_ing (who must then have been\r\ngrowing old) both to the country of the great Yueh-_k_i(78) and to India,\r\nin order to seek for such an image.”\r\n\r\nAn earlier account of the same event is to be found in the Annals of the\r\nAfter (or Eastern) Han dynasty (25-120 A. D.). These annals were compiled\r\nby Fan-yeh, who was afterwards condemned to death as a rebel (445 A. D.).\r\nHere we read(79) (vol. 88, fol. 8 a _seq._): “There is a tradition that\r\nthe Emperor Ming-ti (58-75 A. D.) dreamt that there was a giant-like man\r\nof golden color,(80) whose head was refulgent. The Emperor wanted his\r\nretainers to interpret it. Then some said, ‘There is a god (or spirit) in\r\nthe West who is called Fo, whose height is sixteen feet, and of golden\r\ncolor.’ Having heard this, the Emperor at once sent messengers to\r\nTien-_k_u (_i. e._ India), to inquire after the doctrine of Buddha.\r\nSubsequently, copies of the image of Buddha were drawn in the middle\r\ncountry (_i. e._ China).”\r\n\r\nThe emissaries whom the Emperor Ming-ti had sent to India obtained a\r\nBuddhist Sûtra in forty-two sections, and an image of Buddha, with which\r\nand the Shâmans Kâ_s_yapa Mâtaṅga and _K_û-fa-lan, they returned to the\r\nEast. When Tsâi-yin approached (the capital), he caused the book to be\r\nborne on a white horse, and on this account the monastery of the White\r\nHorse was built on the west of the Yung gate of the city of Lo to lodge\r\nit. The classic was tied up and placed in the stone house of the Lan\r\ntower, and, moreover, pictures of the image were drawn and kept in the\r\n_Kh_ing-yüan tower, and at the top of the Hsien-_k_ieh hill.\r\n\r\nHere we seem to be on _terra firma_, for some of the literary works by\r\nKâsyapa Mâtaṅga and _K_û-fa-lan are still in existence. Kâsyapa Mâtaṅga\r\n(or, it may be, Kâsya Mâtaṅga(81)) is clearly a Sanskrit name. Mâtaṅga,\r\nthough the name of a _K_andâla or low-caste man, might well be borne by a\r\nBuddhist priest.(82) The name of _K_û-fa-lan, however, is more difficult.\r\nChinese scholars declare that it can only be a Chinese name,(83) yet if\r\n_K_û-fa-lan came from India with _K_âsyapa, we should expect that he too\r\nbore a Sanskrit name. In that case, _K_û might be taken as the last\r\ncharacter of Tien-_k_û, India, which character is prefixed to the names of\r\nother Indian priests living in China. His name would be Fâ-lan, _i. e._\r\nDharma + x, whatever lan may signify, perhaps padma, lotus.(84)\r\n\r\nM. Feer,(85) calls him Gobhara_n_a, without, however, giving his authority\r\nfor such a name. The Sutra of the forty-two sections exists in Chinese,\r\nbut neither in Sanskrit nor in Pâli, and many difficulties would be\r\nremoved if we admitted, with M. Feer, that this so-called Sûtra of the\r\nforty-two sections was really the work of Kâ_s_yapa and _K_û-fa-lan, who\r\nconsidered such an epitome of Buddhist doctrines, based chiefly on\r\noriginal texts, useful for their new converts in China.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the Sui Annals speak here of no other literary work due\r\nto Kâ_s_yapa and _K_û-fa-lan, though they afterwards mention the Shih-_k_u\r\n_S_ûtra by _K_û-fa-lan as a work almost unintelligible. In the\r\nFan-i-ming-i-tsi (vol. iii. fol. 4 b), mention is made of five Sûtras,\r\ntranslated by _K_û-fa-lan alone, after Kâ_s_yapa’s death. In the\r\nK’ai-yuen-shih-kiao-mu-lu catalogue of the Buddhist books, compiled in the\r\nperiod K’ai-yuen (713-741 A. D.), vol. i. fol. 6, four Sûtras only are\r\nascribed to _K_û-fa-lan:—\r\n\r\n1. The Da_s_abhûmi, called the Sûtra on the destruction of the causes of\r\nperplexity in the ten stations; 70 A. D. This is the Shi-_k_û Sûtra.\r\n\r\n2. The Sûtra of the treasure of the sea of the law\r\n(Dharma-samudra-kosha?).\r\n\r\n3. The Sûtra of the original conduct of Buddha (Fo-pen-hing-king); 68 A.\r\nD. (taken by Julien for a translation of the Lalita-vistara).\r\n\r\n4. The Sûtra of the original birth of Buddha (_G_âtaka).\r\n\r\nThe compiler of the catalogue adds that these translations have long been\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe next patron of Buddhism was Ying, the King of _Kh_û, at the time of\r\nthe Emperor _K_ang, his father (76-88). Many Shâmans, it is said, came to\r\nChina then from the Western regions, bringing Buddhist Sûtras. Some of\r\nthese translations, however, proved unintelligible.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of the Emperor Hwan (147-167), An-shi-kao (usually called\r\nAn-shing), a Shâman of An-hsi,(86) brought classical books to Lo, and\r\ntranslated them. This is evidently the same translator of whom Mr. Beal\r\n(“J. R. A. S.” 1856, pp. 327, 332) speaks as a native of Eastern Persia or\r\nParthia, and whose name Mr. Wylie wished to identify with Arsak. As\r\nAn-shi-kao is reported to have been a royal prince, who made himself a\r\nmendicant and travelled as far as China, Mr. Wylie supposes that he was\r\nthe son of one of the Arsacidæ, Kings of Persia. Mr. Beal on the contrary,\r\ntakes the name to be a corruption of A_s_vaka or Assaka—_i. e._\r\nἹππάσιοι.(87)\r\n\r\nUnder the Emperor Ling, 168-189 A. D., _K_i-_kh_an (or _K_i-tsin), a\r\nShâman from the Yueh-_k_i (called _K_i-lau-kia-_k_uai by Beal),\r\n_K_û-fo-soh (Ta-fo-sa), an Indian Shâman, and others, worked together to\r\nproduce a translation of the Nirvâ_n_a-sûtra, in two sections. The\r\nK’ai-yuen-lu ascribes twenty-three works to _K_i-_kh_an, and two Sûtras to\r\n_K_û-fo-soh.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the Han dynasty, _K_u-yung, the grand guardian, was a\r\nfollower of Buddha.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Three Kingdoms (220-264) Khang-sang-hui, a Shâman of\r\nthe Western regions, came to Wû(88) with Sûtras and translated them.\r\nSun-_kh_üan, the sovereign, believed in Buddhism. About the same time\r\nKhang-sang-khai translated the longer text of the Sukhavatîvyûha.\r\n\r\nIn Wei,(89) during the period Hwang-_kh_u (220-226) the Chinese first\r\nobserved the Buddhist precepts, shaved their heads, and became Sang—_i.\r\ne._ monks.\r\n\r\nEven before this, a Shâman of the Western regions had come here and\r\ntranslated the Hsiâo-pin Sûtra—_i. e._ the Sûtra of Smaller Matters\r\n(Khudda-kanikâya?)—but the head and tail of it were contradictory, so that\r\nit could not be understood.\r\n\r\nIn the period Kan-lû (256-259), _K_û-shi-hsing (Chu-shuh-lan, in Beal’s\r\n“Catalogue”) went to the West as far as Khoten, and obtained a Sûtra in\r\nninety sections, with which he came back to Yéh, in the Tsin period of\r\nYüen-khang (291-299), and translated it (with Dharmaraksha) under the\r\ntitle of “Light-emitting Pra_gn_â-pâramitâ Sûtra.”(90)\r\n\r\nIn the period Thai-shi (265-274), under the Western Tsin (265-316),\r\nKû-fâ-hu(91) (Dharmaraksha), a Shâman of the Yüeh-_k_i, travelled through\r\nthe various kingdoms of the West, and brought a large collection of books\r\nhome to Lo, where he translated them. It is stated in the Catalogue of the\r\nGreat _K_au, an interlude in the dynasty of Thang (690-705 A. D.), that in\r\nthe seventh year of the period Thai-khang (286) he translated\r\n_K_ing-fa-hwa—_i. e._ the Saddharma-pu_nd_arîka (Beal, “Catalogue,” p.\r\n14).(92)\r\n\r\nAbout 300 A. D. _K_i-kung-ming translated the Wei-ma (Vimala-kîrtti) and\r\nFa-hwa (Saddharma-pu_nd_arîka).(93)\r\n\r\nIn 335 the prince of the _Kh_au kingdom (during the Tsin dynasty)\r\npermitted his subjects to become Shâmans, influenced chiefly by\r\nBuddhasi_m_ha.(94)\r\n\r\nIn the time of the rebel Shih-leh, 330-333, during the Tsin dynasty, a\r\nShâman Wei-tao-an, or Tao-an, of _Kh_ang-shan, studied Buddhist literature\r\nunder Buddhasi_m_ha. He produced a more correct translation of the\r\nVimala-kîrtti-sûtra (and Saddharma-pu_nd_arîka), and taught it widely; but\r\nas he was not an original translator, his name is not mentioned in the\r\nK’ai-yuen-lu. On account of political troubles, Tâo-an led his disciples\r\nsouthward, to Hsin-ye, and dispatched them to different quarters—Fâ-shang\r\nto Yang-_k_âu, Fâ-hwa to Shû—while he himself, with Wei-yüan, went to\r\nHsiang-yang and _Kh_ang-an. Here Fu-_kh_ien, the sovereign of the Fûs, who\r\nabout 350 had got possession of _Kh_ang-an, resisting the authority of the\r\nTsin, and establishing the dynasty of the Former _Kh_in, received him with\r\ndistinction. It was at the wish of Tâo-an that Fu-_kh_ien invited\r\nKumâra_g_îva to _Kh_ang-an; but when, after a long delay, Kumâra_g_îva\r\narrived there, in the second year of the period Hung-shi (400 A. D.),\r\nunder Yâo-hsing, who, in 394, had succeeded Yâo-_kh_ang,(95) the founder\r\nof the After _Kh_in dynasty, Tâo-an had been dead already twenty years.\r\nHis corrected translations, however, were approved by Kumâra_g_îva.\r\n\r\nThis Kumâra_g_îva marks a new period of great activity in the translation\r\nof Buddhist texts. He is said to have come from Ku-tsi, in Tibet, where\r\nthe Emperor Yâo-hsing (397-415) sent for him. Among his translations are\r\nmentioned the Wei-ma or Vima-la-kîrtti-sûtra (Beal’s “Catalogue,” p. 17);\r\nthe Saddharma-pu_nd_arîka (Beal’s “Catalogue,” p. 15); the\r\nSatyasiddha-vyâkara_n_a _s_âstra (Beal’s “Catalogue,” p. 80). He was a\r\ncontemporary of the great traveller, Fa-hian, who went from _Kh_ang-an to\r\nIndia, travelled through more than thirty states, and came back to Nanking\r\nin 414, to find the Emperor Yâo-hsing overturned by the Eastern Tsin\r\ndynasty. He was accompanied by the Indian contemplationist,\r\nBuddha-bhadra.(96) Buddhabhadra translated the Fa-yan-king, the\r\nBuddhâvata_m_saka-vaipulya-sûtra (Beal’s “Catalogue,” p. 9), and he and\r\nFa-hian together, the Mo-ho-sang-_k_i-liu—_i. e._ the Vinaya of the\r\nMahâsaṅghika school (Beal, “Catalogue,” p. 68).\r\n\r\nAnother Shâman who travelled to India about the same time was _K_i-mang,\r\nof Hsin-fang, a district city of Kâo-_kh_ang. In 419, in the period\r\nYüan-hsi, he went as far as Pâ_t_ali-putra, where he obtained the\r\nNirva_n_a-sûtra, and the Saṅghika, a book of discipline.(97) After his\r\nreturn to Kâo-_kh_ang he translated the Nirvâ_n_a-sûtra in twenty\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the Indian Shâman Dharmaraksha II.(98) brought other copies of\r\nthe foreign MSS. to the West of the Ho. And Tsü-_kh_ü Mung-sun, the king\r\nof North Liang, sent messengers to Kâo-_kh_ang for the copy which\r\n_K_i-mang had brought, wishing to compare the two.(99)\r\n\r\nWhen _K_i-mang’s copy arrived,(100) a translation was made of it in thirty\r\nsections. Dharmaraksha II. translated the Suvar_n_a-prabhâsa and the\r\nNirvâ_n_a-Sutrâ, 416-423 A. D. The K’ai-yuen-lu ascribes nineteen works to\r\nDharmalatsin in 131 fascicles.\r\n\r\nBuddhism from that time spread very rapidly in China, and the translations\r\nbecame too numerous to be all mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Mahâyâna school was represented at that time chiefly by the following\r\ntranslations:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Translated by Kumâra_g_îva:\r\n    The Vimalakîrtti-sûtra (Beal, “Catalogue,” p. 17.\r\n    The Saddharmapun_nd_arika-sûtra (Beal, “Catalogue,” p. 15)\r\n    The Satyasiddhavyâkara_n_a-_s_âstra (Beal, “Catalogue,” p. 80)\r\n\r\n    Translated by Dharmalatsin, or Dharmaraksha II.:\r\n    The Suvar_n_aprabhâsa-sûtra (Beal, “Catalogue,” p. 15)\r\n    The Nirvâ_n_a-sûtra (Beal, “Catalogue.” p. 12)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hînayâna school was represented by—\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Sarvâstivâda-vinaya by Kumâra_g_îva (Beal, “Catalogue,” pp.\r\n    67, 68).\r\n\r\n    The Dîrghâgama-sûtra, by Buddhaya_s_as, 410 A. D. (Beal,\r\n    “Catalogue,” p. 36).\r\n\r\n    The Vinaya of the four Parts, by Buddhaya_s_as.(101)\r\n\r\n    The Ekottarâgama-sûtra (Aṅguttara), translated by Dharmanandin, of\r\n    Tukhâra (Fa-hsi).\r\n\r\n    The Abhidharma disquisitions, by Dharmayasas,(102) of Kophene.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Lung-an (397-401) the Ekottarâgama (Anguttara) and\r\nMadhyamâgama-sûtras(103) were translated by Saṅghadeva of Kophene. This is\r\nprobably the Ma_gg_hima Nikâya, translated by Gotama Saṅghadeva, under the\r\nEastern Tsin dynasty, 317-419.\r\n\r\nIn the period Î-hsi (405-418) the Shâman _K_i-fâ-ling brought from Khoten\r\nto Nanking, the southern capital, the Hwâ-yen Sûtra in 36,000 gâthâs, and\r\ntranslated it. This may be the Buddhâvata_m_saka-sûtra, called the\r\nTa-fang-kwang-fo-fa-yan-king (Beal’s “Catalogue,” pp. 9, 10). This\r\ntranslator is not mentioned in the K’ai-yuen-lu.\r\n\r\nIn 420 the Tsin dynasty came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Thai-wu (424-452), of the N. Wei dynasty, persecuted the\r\nBuddhists, 446; but from the year 452 they were tolerated. This dynasty\r\nlasted from 386 to 535, when it was divided into two.\r\n\r\nIn 458 there was a conspiracy under Buddhist influences, and more\r\nstringent laws were enforced against them.\r\n\r\nIn 460 five Buddhists arrived in China from Ceylon, _viâ_ Tibet. Two of\r\nthem, Yashaita, and Vudanandi, brought images.(104) In 502 a Hindu\r\ntranslated Mahâyâna books, called Fixed Positions and Ten Positions.(105)\r\n\r\nDuring the dynasties of _Kh_î (479-502), Liang (502-557), and _Kh_in\r\n(557-589), many famous Shâmans came to China, and translated books.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Wû of Liang (502-549) paid great honor to Buddhism. He made a\r\nlarge collection of the Buddhist canonical books, amounting to 5,400\r\nvolumes, in the Hwâ-lin garden. The Shâman Pao-_kh_ang compiled the\r\ncatalogue in fifty-four fascicles.\r\n\r\nIn the period Yung-ping, 508-511, there was an Indian Shâman Bodhiru_k_i,\r\nwho translated many books, as Kumâra_g_îva had done. Among them were the\r\nEarth-holding _s_âstra (bhûmîdhara _s_âstra?) and the Shi-ti-king-lun, the\r\nDa_s_abhûmika _s_âstra, greatly valued by the followers of the\r\nMahâyâna.(106)\r\n\r\nIn 516, during the period Hsî-phing, the Chinese Shâman Wei-shang was sent\r\nto the West to collect Sûtras and Vinayas, and brought back a collection\r\nof 170 books. He is not, however, mentioned as a translator in the\r\nK’ai-yuen-lu.\r\n\r\nIn 518 Sung-yun, sent by the queen of the Wei country from Lo-yang to\r\nIndia, returned after three years, with 175 volumes. He lived to see\r\nBodhidharma in his coffin. This Bodhidharma, the twenty-eighth patriarch,\r\nhad arrived in Canton by sea in 528, in the time of Wu-ti, the first\r\nEmperor of the Liang dynasty. Some Sanskrit MSS. that had belonged to him,\r\nand other relics, are still preserved in Japan.(107)\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Emperor Wû, of the Northern _K_âu dynasty (561-577), a\r\nShâman, Wei-yüan-sung, accused the Buddhist priests, and the Emperor\r\npersecuted them. But in the first year of Kao-tsu, the founder of the Sui\r\ndynasty, in 589, toleration was again proclaimed. He ordered the people to\r\npay a certain sum of money, according to the number of the members of each\r\nfamily, for the purpose of preparing Sûtras (the Buddhist canon) and\r\nimages. And the Government caused copies of the whole Buddhist canon to be\r\nmade, and placed them in certain temples or monasteries in the capital,\r\nand in several other large cities, in such provinces as Ping-_k_âu,\r\nHsiang-_k_âu, Lo-_k_âu, etc. And the Government caused also another copy\r\nto be made and to be deposited in the Imperial Library. The Buddhist\r\nsacred books among the people were found to be several hundred times more\r\nnumerous than those on the six Kings of Confucius. There were 1,950\r\ndistinct Buddhist books translated.\r\n\r\nIn the period Tâ-yeh (605-616) the Emperor ordered the Shâman _K_i-kwo to\r\ncompose a catalogue of the Buddhist books at the Imperial Buddhist chapel\r\nwithin the gate of the palace. He then made some divisions and\r\nclassifications, which were as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe Sûtras which contained what Buddha had spoken were arranged under\r\nthree divisions:—\r\n\r\n1. The Mahâyâna.\r\n2. The Hînayâna.\r\n3. The Mixed Sûtras.\r\n\r\nOther books, that seemed to be the productions of later men, who falsely\r\nascribed their works to greater names, were classed as Doubtful Books.\r\n\r\nThere were other works in which Bodhisattvas and others went deeply into\r\nthe explanation of the meaning, and illustrated the principles of Buddha.\r\nThese were called Disquisitions, or _S_âstras. Then there were Vinaya, or\r\ncompilations of precepts, under each division as before, Mahâyâna,\r\nHînayâna, Mixed. There were also Records, or accounts of the doings in\r\ntheir times of those who had been students of the system. Altogether there\r\nwere eleven classes under which the books were arranged:—\r\n\r\n1. Sûtra.      Mahâyâna             617 in 2,076 chapters.\r\n               Mixed                487 in 852 chapters.\r\n               Mixed and doubtful   172 in 336 chapters.\r\n2. Vinaya.     Mahâyâna             52 in 91 chapters.\r\n               Hînayâna             80 in 472 chapters.\r\n               Mixed                27 in 46 chapters.\r\n3. _S_âstra.   Mahâyâna             35 in 141 chapters.\r\n               Hînayâna             41 in 567 chapters.\r\n               Mixed                51 in 437 chapters.\r\nTotal                               1962 in 6,198 chapters.\r\n\r\n_Search for Sanskrit MSS. in China._\r\n\r\nIt was the publication of Hiouen-thsang’s Travels which roused the hopes\r\nof Professor Wilson that some of the old Sanskrit MSS. which had been\r\ncarried away from India might still be discovered in China.(108)\r\n\r\nBut though no pains were spared by Sir John Bowring to carry out Professor\r\nWilson’s wishes, though he had catalogues sent to him from Buddhist\r\nlibraries, and from cities where Buddhist compositions might be expected\r\nto exist, the results were disappointing, at least so far as Sanskrit\r\ntexts were concerned. A number of interesting Chinese books, translated\r\nfrom Sanskrit by Hiouen-thsang and others, works also by native Chinese\r\nBuddhists, were sent to the library of the East India House; but what\r\nProfessor Wilson and all Sanskrit scholars with him most desired, Sanskrit\r\nMSS., or copies of Sanskrit MSS., were not forthcoming. Professor Wilson\r\nshowed me, indeed, one copy of a Sanskrit MS. that was sent to him from\r\nChina, and, so far as I remember, it was the Kâla-_K_akra,(109) which we\r\nknow as one of the books translated from Sanskrit into Chinese. That MS.,\r\nhowever, is no longer to be found in the India Office Library, though it\r\ncertainly existed in the old East India House.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment at the failure of Professor Wilson’s and Sir J.\r\nBowring’s united efforts was felt all the more keenly because neither\r\nSanskrit nor Chinese scholars could surrender the conviction that, until a\r\nvery short time ago, Indian MSS. had existed in China. They had been seen\r\nby Europeans, such as Dr. Gutzlaff, the hard-working missionary in China,\r\nwho in a paper, written shortly before his death, and addressed to Colonel\r\nSykes (“Journal R. A. S.” 1856, p. 73), stated that he himself had seen\r\nPâli MSS. preserved by Buddhist priests in China. Whether these MSS. were\r\nin Pâli or Sanskrit would matter little, supposing even that Dr. Gutzlaff\r\ncould not distinguish between the two. He speaks with great contempt of\r\nthe whole Buddhist literature. There was not a single priest, he says,\r\ncapable of explaining the meaning of the Pâli texts, though some were\r\ninterlined with Chinese. “A few works,” he writes, “are found in a\r\ncharacter originally used for writing the Pâli, and may be considered as\r\nfaithful transcripts of the earliest writings of Buddhism. They are looked\r\nupon as very sacred, full of mysteries and deep significations, and\r\ntherefore as the most precious relics of the founder of their creed. With\r\nthe letters of this alphabet the priests perform incantations(110) to\r\nexpel demons, rescue souls from hell, bring down rain on the earth, remove\r\ncalamities, etc. They turn and twist them in every shape, and maintain\r\nthat the very demons tremble at the recitation of them.”\r\n\r\nAnother clear proof of the existence of Sanskrit MSS. in China is found in\r\nthe account of a “Trip to Ning-po and T’hëen-t’hae,” by Dr. Edkins. After\r\nhe had arrived at Fang-kwang, he ascended the Hwa-ling hill, and at the\r\ntop of the hill he describes a small temple with a priest residing in it.\r\n“Scattered over the hill,” he adds, “there are various little temples\r\nwhere priests reside, but the one at the top is the most celebrated, as\r\nbeing the place where Che-k’hae spent a portion of his time, worshipping a\r\nSanskrit manuscript of a Buddhist classic.” On his return he arrived at\r\nthe pagoda erected to the memory of Che-k’hae, the founder of the\r\nThëen-t’hae system of Buddhism, in the Chin dynasty (about 580 A. D.). And\r\na little farther on, situated in a deep dell on the left, was the\r\nmonastery of Kaon-ming-sze. This is particularly celebrated for its\r\npossession of a Sanskrit MS., written on the palm leaf, once read and\r\nexplained by Che-k’hae, but now unintelligible to any of the followers of\r\nBuddhism in these parts. The priests seemed to pay uncommon reverence to\r\nthis MS., which is the only one of the kind to be found in the East of\r\nChina, and thus of great importance in a literary point of view. It is\r\nmore than 1,300 years old, but is in a state of perfect preservation, in\r\nconsequence of the palm leaves, which are written on both sides, having\r\nbeen carefully let into slips of wood, which are fitted on the same\r\ncentral pin, and the whole, amounting to fifty leaves, inclosed in a\r\nrosewood box.\r\n\r\nThis may account for the unwillingness of the priests to part with their\r\nold MSS., whether Sanskrit or Pâli, but it proves at the same time that\r\nthey still exist, and naturally keeps up the hope that some day or other\r\nwe may still get a sight of them.\r\n\r\n_Materials on which Sanskrit MSS. were written._\r\n\r\nOf course, it might be said that if MSS. did not last very long in India,\r\nneither would they do so in China. But even then, we might expect at least\r\nthat as in India the old MSS. were copied whenever they showed signs of\r\ndecay, so they would have been in China. Besides, the climate of China is\r\nnot so destructive as the heat and moisture of the climate of India. In\r\nIndia, MSS. seldom last over a thousand years. Long before that time paper\r\nmade of vegetable substances decays, palm-leaves and birch-bark become\r\nbrittle, and white ants often destroy what might have escaped the ravages\r\nof the climate. It was the duty, therefore, of Indian Rajahs to keep a\r\nstaff of librarians, who had to copy the old MSS. whenever they began to\r\nseem unsafe, a fact which accounts both for the modern date of most of our\r\nSanskrit MSS. and for the large number of copies of the same text often\r\nmet with in the same library.\r\n\r\nThe MSS. carried off to China were in all likelihood not written on paper,\r\nor whatever we like to call the material which Nearchus describes “as\r\ncotton well beaten together,”(111) but on the bark of the birch tree or on\r\npalm leaves. The bark of trees is mentioned as a writing material used in\r\nIndia by Curtius;(112) and in Buddhist Sûtras, such as the Kara_nd_a-vyûha\r\n(p. 69), we actually read of bhûr_g_a, birch, mâsi, ink, and karama\r\n(kalam), as the common requisites for writing. MSS. written on that\r\nmaterial have long been known in Europe, chiefly as curiosities (I had to\r\nwrite many years ago about one of them, preserved in the Library at All\r\nSouls’ College). Of late,(113) however, they have attracted more serious\r\nattention, particularly since Dr. Bühler discovered in Kashmir old MSS.\r\ncontaining independent rescensions of Vedic texts, written on birch bark.\r\nOne of these, containing the whole text of the Rig-Veda Sa_m_hitâ(114)\r\nwith accents, was sent to me, and though it had suffered a good deal,\r\nparticularly on the margins, it shows that there was no difficulty in\r\nproducing from the bark of the birch tree thousands and thousands of pages\r\nof the largest quarto or even folio size, perfectly smooth and pure,\r\nexcept for the small dark lines peculiar to the bark of that tree.(115)\r\n\r\nAt the time of Hiouen-thsang, in the seventh century, palm leaves seem to\r\nhave been the chief material for writing. He mentions a forest of\r\npalm-trees (_Borassus flabelliformis_) near Konka_n_apura (the Western\r\ncoast of the Dekhan),(116) which was much prized on account of its\r\nsupplying material for writing (vol. i. p. 202, and vol. iii. p. 148). At\r\na later time, too, in 965, we read of Buddhist priests returning to China\r\nwith Sanskrit copies of Buddhist books written on palm leaves\r\n(peito).(117) If we could believe Hiouen-thsang, the palm leaf would have\r\nbeen used even so early as the first Buddhist Council,(118) for he says\r\nthat Kâsyapa then wrote the Pi_t_akas on palm leaves (tâla), and spread\r\nthem over the whole of India. In the Pâli _G_âtakas, pa_nn_a is used in\r\nthe sense of letter, but originally par_n_a meant a wing, then a leaf of a\r\ntree, then a leaf for writing. Pa_tt_a, also, which is used in the sense\r\nof a sheet, was originally pattra, a wing, a leaf of a tree.\r\nSuva_nn_a-pa_tt_a, a golden leaf to write on, still shows that the\r\noriginal writing material had been the leaves of trees, most likely of\r\npalm-trees.(119) Potthaka, _i. e._ pustaka, book, likewise occurs in the\r\nPâli _G_âtakas.(120)\r\n\r\nSuch MSS., written on palm leaves, if preserved carefully and almost\r\nworshipped, as they seem to have been in China, might well have survived\r\nto the present day, and they would certainly prove of immense value to the\r\nstudents of Buddhism, if they could still be recovered, whether in the\r\noriginal or even in later copies.\r\n\r\nIt is true, no doubt, that, like all other religions, Buddhism too had its\r\nperiods of trial and persecution in China. We know that during such\r\nperiods—as, for instance, in 845, under the Emperor Wu-tsung—monasteries\r\nwere destroyed, images broken, and books burnt. But these persecutions\r\nseem never to have lasted long, and when they were over, monasteries,\r\ntemples, and pagodas soon sprang up again, images were restored, and books\r\ncollected in greater abundance than ever. Dr. Edkins tells us that “in an\r\naccount of the Ko-t’sing monastery in the History of T’ian-t’ai-shan it is\r\nsaid that a single work was saved from a fire there several centuries ago,\r\nwhich was written on the Pei-to (Pe-ta) or palm leaf of India.” He also\r\nstates that great pagodas were built on purpose as safe repositories of\r\nSanskrit MSS., one being erected by the Emperor for the preservation of\r\nthe newly arrived Sanskrit books at the request of Hiouen-thsang, lest\r\nthey should be injured for want of care. It was 180 feet high, had five\r\nstories with grains of She-li (relics) in the centre of each, and\r\ncontained monuments inscribed with the prefaces written by the Emperor or\r\nPrince Royal to Hiouen-thsang’s translations.\r\n\r\n_Search for Sanskrit MSS. in Japan._\r\n\r\nBeing myself convinced of the existence of old Indian MSS. in China, I\r\nlost no opportunity, during the last five-and-twenty years, of asking any\r\nfriends of mine who went to China to look out for these treasures,\r\nbut—with no result!\r\n\r\nSome years ago, however, Dr. Edkins, who had taken an active part in the\r\nsearch instituted by Professor Wilson and Sir J. Bowring, showed me a book\r\nwhich he had brought from Japan, and which contained a Chinese vocabulary\r\nwith Sanskrit equivalents and a transliteration in Japanese. The Sanskrit\r\nis written in that peculiar alphabet which we find in the old MSS. of\r\nNepâl, and which in China has been further modified, so as to give it an\r\nalmost Chinese appearance.\r\n\r\nThat MS. revived my hopes. If such a book was published in Japan, I\r\nconcluded that there must have been a time when such a book was useful\r\nthere—that is to say, when the Buddhists in Japan studied Sanskrit. Dr.\r\nEdkins kindly left the book with me, and though the Sanskrit portion was\r\nfull of blunders, yet it enabled me to become accustomed to that peculiar\r\nalphabet in which the Sanskrit words are written.\r\n\r\nWhile I was looking forward to more information from Japan, good luck\r\nwould have it that a young Buddhist priest, Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, came to me\r\nfrom Japan, in order to learn Sanskrit and Pâli, and thus to be able in\r\ntime to read the sacred writings of the Buddhists in their original\r\nlanguage, and to compare them with the Chinese and Japanese translations\r\nnow current in his country. After a time, another Buddhist priest, Mr.\r\nKasawara, came to me for the same purpose, and both are now working very\r\nhard at learning Sanskrit. Japan is supposed to contain 34,388,504\r\ninhabitants, all of whom, with the exception of about 1 or 200,000\r\nfollowers of the Shintô religion,(121) are Buddhists, divided into ten\r\nprincipal sects, the sect to which Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio belongs being that of\r\nthe Shinshiu. One of the first questions which I asked Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio,\r\nwhen he came to read Sanskrit with me, was about Sanskrit MSS. in Japan. I\r\nshowed him the Chinese-Sanskrit-Japanese Vocabulary which Dr. Edkins had\r\nleft with me, and he soon admitted that Sanskrit texts in the same\r\nalphabet might be found in Japan, or at all events in China. He wrote home\r\nto his friends, and after waiting for some time, he brought me in December\r\nlast a book which a Japanese scholar, Shuntai Ishikawa, had sent to me,\r\nand which he wished me to correct, and then to send back to him to Japan.\r\nI did not see at once the importance of the book. But when I came to read\r\nthe introductory formula, Evam mayâ srutam, “Thus by me it has been\r\nheard,” the typical beginning of the Buddhist Sûtras, my eyes were opened.\r\nHere, then, was what I had so long been looking forward to—a Sanskrit\r\ntext, carried from India to China, from China to Japan, written in the\r\npeculiar Nepalese alphabet, with a Chinese translation, and a\r\ntransliteration in Japanese. Of course, it is a copy only, not an original\r\nMS.; but copies presuppose originals at some time or other, and, such as\r\nit is, it is a first instalment, which tells us that we ought not to\r\ndespair, for where one of the long-sought-for literary treasures that were\r\ntaken from India to China, and afterwards from China to Japan, has been\r\ndiscovered, others are sure to come to light.\r\n\r\nWe do not possess yet very authentic information on the ancient history of\r\nJapan, and on the introduction of Buddhism into that island. M. Léon de\r\nRosny(122) and the Marquis D’Hervey de Saint-Denys(123) have given us some\r\ninformation on the subject, and I hope that Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio will soon\r\ngive us a trustworthy account of the ancient history of his country, drawn\r\nfrom native authorities. What is told us about the conversion of Japan to\r\nBuddhism has a somewhat legendary aspect, and I shall only select a few of\r\nthe more important facts, as they have been communicated to me by my\r\nSanskrit pupil. Buddhism first reached Japan, not directly from China, but\r\nfrom Corea, which had been converted to Buddhism in the fourth century A.\r\nD. In the year 200 A. D. Corea had been conquered by the Japanese Empress\r\nZingu, and the intercourse thus established between the two countries led\r\nto the importation of Buddhist doctrines from Corea to Japan. In the year\r\n552 A. D. one of the Corean kings sent a bronze statue of Buddha and many\r\nsacred books to the Court of Japan, and after various vicissitudes,\r\nBuddhism became the established religion of the island about 600 A. D.\r\nJapanese students were sent to China to study Buddhism, and they brought\r\nback with them large numbers of Buddhist books, chiefly translations from\r\nSanskrit. In the year 640 A. D. we hear of a translation of the\r\nSukhavatîvyûhama-hâyâna-sûtra being read in Japan. This is the title of\r\nthe Sanskrit text now sent to me from Japan. The translation had been made\r\nby Kô-sô-gai (in Chinese, Khang-sang-khai), a native of Tibet, though\r\nliving in India, 252 A. D., and we are told that there had been eleven\r\nother translations of the same text.(124)\r\n\r\nAmong the teachers of these Japanese students we find our old friend\r\nHiouen-thsang, whom the Japanese call Genziô. In the year 653 a Japanese\r\npriest, Dosho by name, studied under Genziô, adopted the views of the sect\r\nfounded by him,—the Hossô sect,—and brought back with him to Japan a\r\ncompilation of commentaries on the thirty verses of Vasubandhu, written by\r\nDharmapâla, and translated by Genziô. Two other priests, Chitsû and\r\nChitatsu, likewise became his pupils, and introduced the famous\r\nAbhidharma-kosha-sâstra into Japan, which had been composed by Vasubandhu,\r\nand translated by Genziô. They seem to have favored the Hînayâna, or the\r\nviews of the Small Vehicle (Kushashiu).\r\n\r\nIn the year 736 we hear of a translation of the\r\nBuddhâvata_m_saka-vaipulya-sûtra, by Buddhabhadra and others(125) (317-419\r\nA. D.), being received in Japan, likewise of a translation of the\r\nSaddharma-pu_nd_arîka by Kumara_g_îva.(126)\r\n\r\nAnd, what is more important still, in the ninth century we are told that\r\nKukai (died 835), the founder of the Shingon sect in Japan, was not only a\r\ngood Chinese, but a good Sanskrit scholar also. Nay, one of his disciples,\r\nShinnyo, in order to perfect his knowledge of Buddhist literature,\r\nundertook a journey, not only to China, but to India, but died before he\r\nreached that country.\r\n\r\nThese short notices, which I owe chiefly to Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, make it\r\nquite clear that we have every right to expect Sanskrit MSS., or, at all\r\nevents, Sanskrit texts, in Japan, and the specimen which I have received\r\nencourages me to hope that some of these Sanskrit texts may be older than\r\nany which exist at present in any part of India.\r\n\r\n_The Sukhavatî-vyûha._\r\n\r\nThe text which was sent to me bears the title of\r\nSukhâvatî-vyûha-mahâyâna-sûtra.(127) This is a title well known to all\r\nstudents of Buddhist literature. Burnouf, in his “Introduction à\r\nl’Histoire du Buddhisme” (pp. 99-102),(128) gave a short account of this\r\nSûtra, which enables us to see that the scene of the dialogue was laid at\r\nRâ_g_ag_ri_ha, and that the two speakers were Bhagavat and Ânanda.\r\n\r\nWe saw before, in the historical account of Buddhism in Japan, that no\r\nless than twelve Chinese translations of a work bearing the same title\r\nwere mentioned. The Chinese tell us at least of five translations which\r\nare still in existence.(129)\r\n\r\nThose of the Han and Wu dynasties (25-280 A. D.), we are told, were too\r\ndiffuse, and those of the later periods, the T’ang and Sung dynasties, too\r\nliteral. The best is said to be that by Kô-sô-gai, a priest of Tibetan\r\ndescent, which was made during the early Wei dynasty, about 252 A. D. This\r\nmay be the same which was read in Japan in 640 A. D.\r\n\r\nThe same Sûtra exists also in a Tibetan translation, for there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the Sûtra quoted by Csoma Körösi (“As. Res.” vol. xx. p.\r\n408) under the name of Amitâbha-vyûha is the same work. It occupies, as M.\r\nLéon Feer informs me, fifty-four leaves, places the scene of the dialogue\r\nat Râ_g_ag_ri_ha, on the mountain Gr_i_dhra-kû_t_a, and introduces\r\nBhagavat and Ânanda as the principal speakers.\r\n\r\nThere are Sanskrit MSS. of the Sukhavatî-vyûha in your own Library, in\r\nParis, at Cambridge, and at Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the MSS. of the Sukhavatî-vyûha, hitherto\r\nknown:—\r\n\r\n1. MS. of the Royal Asiatic Society, London (Hodgson Collection), No. 20.\r\nSukhavatîvyûha-mahâyânasûtra, sixty-five leaves. Dated Samvat 934 = A. D.\r\n1814. It begins: Namo\r\nda_s_adiganantâparyantalokadhâtupratish_t_itebhya_h_, etc. Eva_m_ mayâ\r\n_s_rutam ekasmi_m_ samaye Bhagavân Râ_g_ag_ri_he viharati sma.

(Nepalese alphabet.)\r\n\r\n2. MS. of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (Collection Burnouf), No. 85;\r\nsixty-four leaves. It begins, after a preamble of five lines, Eva_m_ mayâ\r\n_s_ruta_m_mekasmi samaya Bhagavân Râ_g_ag_ri_he viharati sma\r\nG_ri_dhraku_t_e parvvate mahatâ Bhikshusanghena sârddham.

MS. of the Société Asiatique at Paris (Collection Hodgson), No. 17;\r\neighty-two leaves. (Nepalese alphabet.)(131)\r\n\r\n4. MS. of the University Library at Cambridge, No. 1368; thirty-five\r\nleaves. It begins with some lines of prose and verse in praise of Amitâbha\r\nand Sukhavatî, and then proceeds: Eva_m_ mayâ _s_rutam ekasmi_m_ samaye\r\nBhagavân Râ_g_ag_ri_he nagare viharati sma, G_ri_dhrakû_t_aparvate mahatâ\r\nBhikshusanghena sârddha, etc. It ends: iti srîmad amitâbhasya tathâgatasya\r\nSukhâvatîvyûha-mahâyânasûtra_m_ samâptam. (Nepalese alphabet, modern.)\r\n\r\n5. MS. given by Mr. Hodgson to the Bodleian Library Oxford (Hodgson 3). It\r\nbegins with: Om namo ratnatrayâya. Om nama_h_\r\nsarvabuddhabodhisattvebhya_h_, etc. Then Eva_m_ mayâ _s_rutam, etc. It\r\nends with sukhavâtîvyûhamahâyânasûtra_m_ samâpta_m_. (Nepalese alphabet,\r\nmodern.)\r\n\r\nBut when I came to compare these Sanskrit MSS. with the text sent to me\r\nfrom Japan, though the title was the same, I soon perceived that their\r\ncontents were different. While the text, as given in the ordinary\r\nDevanâgari or Nepalese MSS., fills about fifty to sixty leaves, the text\r\nof the Sûtra that reached me from Japan would hardly occupy more than\r\neight or ten leaves.\r\n\r\nI soon convinced myself that this MS. was not a text abbreviated in Japan,\r\nfor this shorter text, sent to me from Japan, correspond in every respect\r\nwith the Chinese Sûtra translated by Mr. Beal in his “Catena,” pp.\r\n378-383, and published in your Journal, 1866, p. 136. No doubt the Chinese\r\ntranslation, on which Mr. Beal’s translation is based, is not only free,\r\nbut displays the misapprehensions peculiar to many Chinese renderings of\r\nSanskrit texts, due to a deficient knowledge either of Sanskrit or of\r\nChinese on the part of the translators, perhaps also to the different\r\ngenius of those two languages.\r\n\r\nYet, such as it is, there can be no doubt that it was meant to be a\r\ntranslation of the text now in my possession. Mr. Beal tells us that the\r\ntranslation he followed is that by Kumâra_g_îva, the contemporary of\r\nFa-hian (400 A. D.), and that this translator omitted repetitions and\r\nsuperfluities in the text.(132) Mr. Edkins knows a translation, _s. t._\r\nWou-liang-sheu-king, made under the Han dynasty.(133) What is important is\r\nthat in the Chinese translation of the shorter text the scene is laid, as\r\nin the Japanese Sanskrit text, at _S_râvastî, and the principal speakers\r\nare Bhagavat and _S_âriputra.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Tibetan translation of the short text, described by Csoma\r\nKörösi (“As. Res.” vol. xx. p. 439). Here, though the name of the scene is\r\nnot mentioned, the speakers are Bhagavat and _S_âriputra. The whole work\r\noccupies seven leaves only, and the names of the sixteen principal\r\ndisciples agree with the Japanese text. The translators were\r\nPra_g_nâvarman, Sûrendra, and the Tibetan Lotsava Ya-shes-sde.\r\n\r\nM. Feer informs me that there is at the National Library a Chinese text\r\ncalled O-mi-to-king, _i. e._ Amitâbha-sûtra.(134) The scene is at\r\n_S_râvastî; the speakers are Bhagavat _S_âriputra.\r\n\r\nAnother text at the National Library is called Ta-o-mi-to-king, _i. e._\r\nMahâ Amitâbha-sûtra, and here the scene is at Râ_g_ag_ri_ha.\r\n\r\nThere is, besides, a third work, called Kwan-wou-liang-sheu-king by\r\nKiang-ling-ye-she, _i. e._ Kâlaya_s_as, a foreigner of the West, who lived\r\nin China about 424 A. D.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, historical evidence of the existence of three Sûtras,\r\ndescribing Sukhavatî, or the Paradise of Amitâbha. We know two of them in\r\nSanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan—one long, the other short. The third is\r\nknown as yet in Chinese only.\r\n\r\nOf the two Sanskrit texts, the one from Nepal, the other from Japan, the\r\nlatter seems certainly the earlier. But even the fuller text must have\r\nexisted at a very early time, because it was translated by\r\n_K_i-lau-kia-_kh_ai, under the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 A. D.)—_i. e._\r\nat all events before 220 A. D.\r\n\r\nThe shorter text is first authenticated through the translation of\r\nKumâra_g_îva, about 400 A. D.; but if the views generally entertained as\r\nto the relative position of the longer and shorter Sûtras be correct, we\r\nmay safely claim for our short Sûtra a date within the second century of\r\nour era.\r\n\r\nWhat Japan has sent us is, therefore, a Sanskrit text, of which we had no\r\ntrace before, which must have left India at least before 400 A. D., but\r\nprobably before 200 A. D., and which gives us the original of that\r\ndescription of Amitâbha’s Paradise, which formerly we knew in a Chinese\r\ntranslation only, which was neither complete nor correct.\r\n\r\nThe book sent to me was first published in Japan in 1773, by Ziômiô, a\r\nBuddhist priest. The Sanskrit text is intelligible, but full of\r\ninaccuracies, showing clearly that the editor did not understand Sanskrit,\r\nbut simply copied what he saw before him. The same words occurring in the\r\nsame line are written differently, and the Japanese transliteration simply\r\nrepeats the blunders of the Sanskrit transcript.\r\n\r\nThere are two other editions of the same text, published in 1794 A. D. by\r\nanother Japanese priest, named Hôgŏ. These are in the possession of Mr.\r\nBunyiu Nanjio, and offered some help in correcting the text. One of them\r\ncontains the text and three Chinese translations, one being merely a\r\nliteral rendering, while the other two have more of a literary character\r\nand are ascribed to Kumâra_g_îva (400 A. D.), and Hiouen-thsang (648 A.\r\nD.).\r\n\r\nLastly, there is another book by the same Hôgŏ, in four volumes, in which\r\nan attempt is made to give a grammatical analysis of the text. This,\r\nhowever, as Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio informs me, is very imperfect.\r\n\r\nI have to-day brought with me the Japanese Sanskrit text, critically\r\nrestored, and a literal translation into English, to which I have added a\r\nfew notes.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n_Adoration to the Omniscient._\r\n\r\nThis is what I have heard. At one time the Blessed (Bhagavat, _i. e._\r\nBuddha) dwelt at _S_râvastî,(135) in the _G_eta-grove, in the garden of\r\nAnâthapi_nd_aka, together with(136) a large company of Bhikshus (mendicant\r\nfriars), viz. with thirteen hundred Bhikshus, all of them acquainted with\r\nthe five kinds of knowledge,(137) elders, great disciples,(138) and\r\nArhats,(139) such as _S_âriputra, the elder, Mahâmaudgalyâyana,\r\nMahâkâ_s_yapa, Mahâkapphi_n_a, Mahâkâtyâyana, Mahâkaush_th_ila, Revata,\r\n_S_uddhipanthaka, Nanda, Ânanda, Râhula, Gavâmpati, Bharadvâ_g_a,\r\nKâlodayin, Vakkula, and Aniruddha. He dwelt together with these and many\r\nother great disciples, and together with many noble-minded Bodhisattvas,\r\nsuch as Ma_ñg_usrî, the prince, the Bodhisattva A_g_ita, the Bodhisattva\r\nGandhahastin, the Bodhisattva Nityodyukta, the Bodhisattva\r\nAnikshiptadhura. He dwelt together with them and many other noble-minded\r\nBodhisattvas, and with _S_akra, the Indra or King(140) of the Devas, and\r\nwith Brahman Sahâmpati. With these and many other hundred thousands of\r\nNayutas(141) of sons of the gods, Bhagavat dwelt at _S_râvastî.\r\n\r\nThen Bhagavat addressed the honored _S_âriputra and said: O _S_âriputra,\r\nafter you have passed from here over a hundred thousand Ko_t_is of\r\nBuddha-countries there is in the Western part of a Buddha-country, a world\r\ncalled Sukhavatî (the happy country). And there a Tathâgata, called\r\nAmitâyus, an Arhat, fully enlightened, dwells now, and remains, and\r\nsupports himself, and teaches the Law.(142)\r\n\r\nNow what do you think, _S_riputra, for what reason is that world called\r\nSukhavatî (the happy)? In that world Sukhavatî, O _S_riputra, there is\r\nneither bodily nor mental pain for living beings. The sources of happiness\r\nare innumerable there. For that reason is that world called Sukhavatî (the\r\nhappy).\r\n\r\nAnd again, O _S_âriputra, that world Sukhavatî is adorned with seven\r\nterraces, with seven rows of palm-trees, and with strings of bells.(143)\r\nIt is inclosed on every side,(144) beautiful, brilliant with the four\r\ngems, viz. gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. With such arrays of\r\nexcellences peculiar to a Buddha-country is that Buddha-country adorned.\r\n\r\nAnd again, O _S_âriputra, in that world Sukhavatî there are lotus lakes,\r\nadorned with the seven gems, viz. gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red\r\npearls, diamonds, and corals as the seventh. They are full of water which\r\npossesses the eight good qualities,(145) their waters rise as high as the\r\nfords and bathing-places, so that even crows(146) may drink there; they\r\nare full of golden sand, and of vast extent. And in these lotus lakes\r\nthere are all around on the four sides four stairs, beautiful and\r\nbrilliant with the four gems, viz. gold, silver, beryl, crystal. And on\r\nevery side of these lotus lakes gem trees are growing, beautiful and\r\nbrilliant with the seven gems, viz. gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red\r\npearls, diamonds, and corals as the seventh. And in those lotus lakes\r\nlotus flowers are growing, blue, blue-colored, of blue splendor, blue to\r\nbehold; yellow, yellow-colored, of yellow splendor, yellow to behold; red,\r\nred-colored, of red splendor, red to behold; white, white-colored, of\r\nwhite splendor, white to behold; beautiful, beautifully-colored, of\r\nbeautiful splendor, beautiful to behold, and in circumference as large as\r\nthe wheel of a chariot.\r\n\r\nAnd again, O _S_âriputra, in that Buddha-country there are heavenly\r\nmusical instruments always played on and the earth is lovely and of golden\r\ncolor. And in that Buddha-country a flower-rain of heavenly Mândârava\r\nblossoms pours down three times every day, and three times every night.\r\nAnd the beings who are born there worship before their morning meal(147) a\r\nhundred thousand Ko_t_is of Buddhas by going to other worlds; and having\r\nshowered a hundred thousand of Ko_t_is of flowers upon each Tathâgata,\r\nthey return to their own world in time for the afternoon rest.(148) With\r\nsuch arrays of excellences peculiar to a Buddha-country is that\r\nBuddha-country adorned.\r\n\r\nAnd again, O _S_âriputra, there are in that Buddha-country swans,\r\ncurlews,(149) and peacocks. Three times every night, and three times every\r\nday, they come together and perform a concert, each uttering his own note.\r\nAnd from them thus uttering proceeds a sound proclaiming the five virtues,\r\nthe five powers, and the seven steps leading towards the highest\r\nknowledge.(150) When the men there hear that sound, remembrance of Buddha,\r\nremembrance of the Law, remembrance of the Assembly, rises in their mind.\r\n\r\nNow, do you think, O _S_âriputra, that these are beings who have entered\r\ninto the nature of animals (birds, etc.)? This is not to be thought of.\r\nThe very name of hells is unknown in that Buddha-country, and likewise\r\nthat of (descent into) animal natures and of the realm of Yama (the four\r\napâyas).(151) No, these tribes of birds have been made on purpose by the\r\nTathâgata Amitâyus, and they utter the sound of the Law. With such arrays\r\nof excellences, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd again, O _S_âriputra, when those rows of palm-trees and strings of\r\nbells in that Buddha-country are moved by the wind, a sweet and\r\nenrapturing sound proceeds from them. Yes, O _S_âriputra, as from a\r\nheavenly musical instrument consisting of a hundred thousand Ko_t_is of\r\nsounds, when played by Âryas, a sweet and enrapturing sound proceeds, a\r\nsweet and enrapturing sound proceeds from those rows of palm-trees and\r\nstrings of bells moved by the wind. And when the men hear that sound,\r\nreflection on Buddha arises in their body, reflection on the Law,\r\nreflection on the Assembly. With such arrays of excellences, etc.\r\n\r\nNow what do you think, O _S_âriputra, for what reason is that Tathâgata\r\ncalled Amitâyus? The length of life (âyus), O _S_âriputra, of that\r\nTathâgata and of those men there is immeasurable (amita). Therefore is\r\nthat Tathâgata called Amitâyus. And ten Kalpas have passed, O _S_âriputra,\r\nsince that Tathâgata awoke to perfect knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you think, O _S_âriputra, for what reason is that Tathâgata\r\ncalled Amitâbhâs? The splendor (âbhâs), O _S_âriputra, of that Tathâgata\r\nis unimpeded over all Buddha-countries. Therefore is that Tathâgata called\r\nAmitâbhâs.\r\n\r\nAnd there is, O _S_âriputra, an innumerable assembly of disciples with\r\nthat Tathâgata, purified and venerable persons, whose number it is not\r\neasy to count. With such arrays of excellences, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd again, O _S_âriputra, of those beings also who are born in the\r\nBuddha-country of the Tathâgata Amitâyus as purified Bodhisattvas, never\r\nto return again and bound by one birth only, of those Bodhisattvas also, O\r\n_S_âriputra, the number is not easy to count, except they are reckoned as\r\ninfinite in number.(152)\r\n\r\nThen again all beings, O _S_âriputra, ought to make fervent prayer for\r\nthat Buddha-country. And why? Because they come together there with such\r\nexcellent men. Beings are not born in that Buddha-country of the Tathâgata\r\nAmitâyus as a reward and result of good works performed in this present\r\nlife.(153) No, whatever son or daughter of a family shall hear the name of\r\nthe blessed Amitâyus, the Tathâgata, and having heard it, shall keep it in\r\nmind, and with thoughts undisturbed shall keep it in mind for one, two,\r\nthree, four, five, six, or seven nights, that son or daughter of a family,\r\nwhen he or she comes to die, then that Amitâyus, the Tathâgata, surrounded\r\nby an assembly of disciples and followed by a host of Bodhisattvas, will\r\nstand before them at their hour of death, and they will depart this life\r\nwith tranquil minds. After their death they will be born in the world\r\nSukhavatî, in the Buddha-country of the same Amitâyus, the Tathâgata.\r\nTherefore, then, O _S_âriputra, having perceived this cause and\r\neffect,(154) I with reverence say thus, Every son and every daughter of a\r\nfamily ought to make with their whole mind fervent prayer for that\r\nBuddha-country.\r\n\r\nAnd now, O _S_âriputra, as I here at present glorify that world, thus in\r\nthe East, O _S_âriputra, other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tathâgata\r\nAkshobhya, the Tathâgata Merudhva_g_a, the Tathâgata Mahâmeru, the\r\nTathâgata Meruprabhâsa, and the Tathâgata Ma_ñg_udhva_g_a, equal in number\r\nto the sand of the river Gangâ, comprehend their own Buddha-countries in\r\ntheir speech, and then reveal them.(155) Accept this repetition of the\r\nLaw, called the “Favor of all Buddhas,” which magnifies their\r\ninconceivable excellences.\r\n\r\nThus also in the South, do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tathâgata\r\n_K_andrasûryapradîpa, the Tathâgata Yasa_h_prabha, the Tathâgata\r\nMahâr_k_iskandha, the Tathâgata Merupradîpa, the Tathâgata Anantavîrya,\r\nequal in number to the sand of the river Gangâ, comprehend their own\r\nBuddha-countries in their speech, and then reveal them. Accept, etc.\r\n\r\nThus also in the West do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tathâgata\r\nAmitâyus, the Tathâgata Amitaskandha, the Tathâgata Amitadhva_g_a, the\r\nTathâgata Mahâprabha, the Tathâgata Mahâratnaketu, the Tathagata\r\n_S_uddhara_s_miprabha, equal in number to the sand of the river Gangâ,\r\ncomprehend, etc.\r\n\r\nThus also in the North do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tathâgata\r\nMahâr_k_iskandha, the Tathâgata Vai_s_vânaranirghosha, the Tathâgata\r\nDundubhisvaranirghosha, the Tathâgata Dushpradharsha, the Tathâgata\r\nÂdityasambhava, the Tathâgata _G_aleniprabha (_G_valanaprabha?), the\r\nTathâgata Prabhâkara, equal in number to the sand, etc.\r\n\r\nThus also in the Nadir do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tathâgata\r\nSi_m_ha, the Tathâgata Ya_s_as, the Tathâgata Ya_s_a_h_prabhâva, the\r\nTathâgata Dharma, the Tathâgata Dharmadhara, the Tathâgata Dharmadhva_g_a,\r\nequal in number to the sand, etc.\r\n\r\nThus also in the Zenith do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tathâgata\r\nBrahmaghosha, the Tathâgata Nakshatrarâ_g_a, the Tathâgata\r\nIndraketudhva_g_arâ_g_a, the Tathâgata Gandhottama, the Tathâgata\r\nGandhaprabhâsa, the Tathâgata Mahâr_k_iskandha, the Tathâgata\r\nRatnakusumasampushpitagâtra, the Tathâgata Sâlendrarâ_g_a, the Tathâgata\r\nRatnotpalasri, the Tathâgata Sarvâdarsa, the Tathâgata Sumerukalpa, equal\r\nin number to the sand, etc.(156)\r\n\r\nNow what do you think, O _S_âriputra, for what reason is that repetition\r\nof the Law called the Favor of all Buddhas? Every son or daughter of a\r\nfamily who shall hear the name of that repetition of the Law and retain in\r\ntheir memory the names of those blessed Buddhas, will all be favored by\r\nthe Buddhas, and will never return again, being once in possession of the\r\ntranscendent true knowledge. Therefore, then, O _S_âriputra, believe,(157)\r\naccept, and long for me and those blessed Buddhas!\r\n\r\nWhatever sons or daughters of a family shall make mental prayer for the\r\nBuddha-country of that blessed Amitâyus, the Tathâgata, or are making it\r\nnow or have made it formerly, all these will never return again, being\r\nonce in possession of the transcendent true knowledge. They will be born\r\nin that Buddha-country, have been born, or are being born now. Therefore,\r\nthen, O _S_âriputra, mental prayer is to be made for that Buddha-country\r\nby faithful sons and daughters of a family.\r\n\r\nAnd as I at present magnify here the inconceivable excellences of those\r\nblessed Buddhas, thus, O _S_âriputra, do those blessed Buddhas magnify my\r\nown inconceivable excellences.\r\n\r\nA very difficult work has been done by _S_âkyamuni, the sovereign of the\r\n_S_âkyas. Having obtained the transcendent true knowledge in this world\r\nSaha, he taught the Law which all the world is reluctant to accept, during\r\nthis corruption of the present Kalpa, during this corruption of mankind,\r\nduring this corruption of belief, during this corruption of life, during\r\nthis corruption of passions.\r\n\r\nThis is even for me, O _S_âriputra, an extremely difficult work that,\r\nhaving obtained the transcendent true knowledge in this world Saha, I\r\ntaught the Law which all the world is reluctant to accept, during this\r\ncorruption of mankind, of belief, of passion, of life, and of this present\r\nKalpa.\r\n\r\nThus spoke Bhagavat joyful in his mind. And the honorable _S_âriputra, and\r\nthe Bhikshus and Bodhisattvas, and the whole world with the gods, men,\r\nevil spirits, and genii, applauded the speech of Bhagavat.(158)\r\n\r\nThis is the Mahâyânasûtra called Sukhavatîvyûha.\r\n\r\nThis Sûtra sounds to us, no doubt, very different from the original\r\nteaching of Buddha. And so it is. Nevertheless it is the most popular and\r\nmost widely read Sûtra in Japan, and the whole religion of the great mass\r\nof the people may be said to be founded on it. “Repeat the name of\r\nAmitâbha as often as you can, repeat it particularly in the hour of death,\r\nand you will go straight to Sukhavatî and be happy forever;” this is what\r\nJapanese Buddhists are asked to believe: this is what they are told was\r\nthe teaching of Buddha. There is one passage in our Sûtra which seems even\r\nto be pointedly directed against the original teaching of Buddha. Buddha\r\ntaught that as a man soweth so shall he reap, and that by a stock of good\r\nworks accumulated on earth the way is opened to higher knowledge and\r\nhigher bliss. Our Sûtra says No; not by good works done on earth, but by a\r\nmere repetition of the name of Amitâbha is an entrance gained into the\r\nland of bliss. This is no better than what later Brahmanism teaches, viz.\r\n“Repeat the name of Hari or of K_ri_sh_n_a, and you will be saved.” It is\r\nno better than what even some Christian teachers are reported to teach. It\r\nmay be that in a lower stage of civilization even such teaching has\r\nproduced some kind of good.(159) But Japan is surely ripe for better\r\nthings. What the worship of Amitâbha may lead to we can learn from a\r\ndescription given by Dr. Edkins in his “Trip to Ning-po and T’hëen-t’hae.”\r\n“The next thing,” he writes, “shown to us was the prison, in which about a\r\ndozen priests had allowed themselves to be shut up for a number of months\r\nor years, during which they were to occupy themselves in repeating the\r\nname of Amida Buddha,(160) day and night, without intermission. During the\r\nday the whole number were to be thus engaged; and during the night they\r\ntook it by turns, and divided themselves into watches, so as to insure the\r\nkeeping up of the work till morning. We asked when they were to be let\r\nout. To which it was replied, that they might be liberated at their own\r\nrequest, but not before they had spent several months in seclusion. We\r\ninquired what could be the use of such an endless repetition of the name\r\nof Buddha. To which it was answered, that the constant repetition of the\r\nsacred name had a tendency to purify the heart, to deaden the affections\r\ntowards the present world, and to prepare them for the state of Nirvâ_n_a.\r\nIt was further asked whether Buddha was likely to be pleased with such an\r\nendless repetition of his name. To which it was answered, that in the\r\nWestern world it was considered a mark of respect to repeat the name of\r\nany one whom we delighted to honor. The recluses seemed most of them young\r\nmen; some of whom came out to the bars of their cage to look at the\r\nstrangers, but kept on repeating the name of Buddha as they stood there.\r\nIt appeared to us that nothing was more calculated to produce idiocy than\r\nsuch a perpetual repetition of a single name, and the stupid appearance of\r\nmany of the priests whom we have seen seems to have been induced by some\r\nsuch process.”\r\n\r\nIs it not high time that the millions who live in Japan, and profess a\r\nfaith in Buddha, should be told that this doctrine of Amitâbha and all the\r\nMahâyâna doctrine is a secondary form of Buddhism, a corruption of the\r\npure doctrine of the Royal Prince, and that if they really mean to be\r\nBuddhists, they should return to the words of Buddha, as they are\r\npreserved to us in the old Sûtras? Instead of depending, as they now do,\r\non Chinese translations, not always accurate, of degraded and degrading\r\nMahâyâna tracts, why should they not have Japanese translations of the\r\nbest portions of Buddha’s real doctrine, which would elevate their\r\ncharacter, and give them a religion of which they need not be ashamed?\r\nThere are Chinese translations of some of the better portions of the\r\nSacred Writings of Buddhism. They exist in Japan too, as may be seen in\r\nthat magnificent collection of the Buddhist Tripi_t_aka which was sent\r\nfrom Japan as a present to the English Government, and of which Mr. Beal\r\nhas given us a very useful Catalogue. But they are evidently far less\r\nconsidered in Japan than the silly and the mischievous stories of Amitâbha\r\nand his Paradise, and those which I know from translations are far from\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nI hope that Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio and Mr. Kasawara, if they diligently\r\ncontinue their study of Sanskrit and Pâli, will be able to do a really\r\ngreat and good work, after their return to Japan. And if more young\r\nBuddhist priests are coming over, I shall always, so far as my other\r\noccupations allow it, be glad to teach them, and to help them in their\r\nunselfish work. There is a great future in store, I believe, for those\r\nEastern Islands, which have been called prophetically “the England of the\r\nEast,” and to purify and reform their religion—that is, to bring it back\r\nto its original form—is a work that must be done before anything else can\r\nbe attempted.\r\n\r\nIn return, I hope that they and their friends in Japan, and in Corea and\r\nChina too, will do all they can to discover, if possible, some more of the\r\nancient Sanskrit texts, and send them over to us. A beginning, at all\r\nevents, has been made, and if the members of this Society who have friends\r\nin China or in Japan will help, if H. E. the Japanese Minister, Mori\r\nArinori, who has honored us by his presence today, will lend us his\r\npowerful assistance, I have little doubt that the dream which passed\r\nbefore the mind of your late President may still become a reality, and\r\nthat some of the MSS. which, beginning with the beginning of our era, were\r\ncarried from India to China, Corea, and Japan, may return to us, whether\r\nin the original or in copies, like the one sent to me by Mr. Shuntai\r\nIshikawa.\r\n\r\nWith the help of such MSS. we shall be able all the better to show to\r\nthose devoted students who from the extreme East have come to the extreme\r\nWest in order to learn to read their sacred writings in the original\r\nSanskrit or Pâli, what difference there is between the simple teaching of\r\nBuddha and the later developments and corruptions of Buddhism. Buddha\r\nhimself, I feel convinced, never knew even the names of Amitâbha,\r\nAvalokite_s_vara, or Sukhavatî. Then, how can a nation call itself\r\nBuddhist whose religion consists chiefly in a belief in a divine Amitâbha\r\nand his son Avalokite_s_vara, and in a hope of eternal life in the\r\nparadise of Sukhavatî?\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT: _Oxford, March 10, 1880._\r\n\r\nThe hope which I expressed in my paper on “Sanskrit Texts discovered in\r\nJapan,” viz. that other Sanskrit texts might still come to light in Japan\r\nor China, has been fulfilled sooner than I expected. Mr. A Wylie wrote to\r\nme on March 3 that he had brought a number of Sanskrit-Chinese books from\r\nJapan, and he afterwards kindly sent them to me to examine. They were of\r\nthe same appearance and character as the dictionary which Dr. Edkins had\r\nlent me, and the Sukhavatî-vyûha which I had received from Japan. But with\r\nthe exception of a collection of invocations, called the Va_g_ra-sûtra,\r\nand the short Pra_gñ_â-h_ri_daya-sûtra, they contained no continuous\r\ntexts. The books were intended to teach the Sanskrit alphabet, and every\r\npossible and impossible combination of the Devanâgarî letters, and that\r\nwas all. Still, so large a number of books written to teach the Sanskrit\r\nalphabet augurs well for the existence of Sanskrit texts. There was among\r\nMr. Wylie’s books a second Chinese-Sanskrit-Japanese vocabulary, of which\r\nMr. Kasawara has given me the following account: “This vocabulary is\r\ncalled ‘A Thousand Sanskrit and Chinese Words’ and it is said to have been\r\narranged by I-tsing, who left China for India in 671, about twenty-seven\r\nyears after Hiouen-thsang’s return to China, and who is best known as the\r\nauthor of a book called Nanhae-ki-kwei-_k_ou’en, on the manners and\r\ncustoms of the Indian Buddhists at that time.\r\n\r\n“This vocabulary was brought from China to Japan by Zikaku, a Japanese\r\npriest, who went to China in 838 and returned in 847. It is stated at the\r\nend of the book, that in the year 884 a Japanese priest of the name of\r\nRioyiu copied that vocabulary from a text belonging to another priest,\r\nYûĭkai. The edition brought from Japan by Mr. Wylie was published there in\r\nthe year 1727 by a priest called Jakumio.”\r\n\r\nThe following curious passage occurs in the preface of Jakumio’s edition:\r\n“This vocabulary is generally called ‘One Thousand Sanskrit and Chinese\r\nWords.’ It is stated in Annen’s work, that this was first brought (from\r\nChina) by Zikaku. I have corrected several mistakes in this vocabulary,\r\ncomparing many copies; yet the present edition is not free from blunders;\r\nI hope the readers will correct them, if they have better copies.\r\n\r\n“In the temple Hôriuji, in Yamato, there are treasured\r\nPra_gñ_âpâramitâh_ri_dayasûtram, and Son-shio-dhâra_n_i, written on two\r\npalm leaves, handed down from Central India; and, at the end of these,\r\nfourteen letters of the ‘siddha’ are written. In the present edition of\r\nthe vocabulary the alphabet is in imitation of that of the palm leaves,\r\nexcept such forms of letters as cannot be distinguished from those\r\nprevalent among the scriveners at the present day.\r\n\r\n“Hôriuji is one of eleven temples founded by the prince Umayado (who died\r\nA. D. 621). This temple is at a town named Tatsuta, in the province\r\nYamato, near Kioto, the western capital.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have clear evidence that in the year 1727 palm leaves\r\ncontaining the text of Sanskrit Sûtras were still preserved in the temple\r\nof Hôriuji. If that temple is still in existence, might not some Buddhist\r\npriest of Kioto, the western capital of Japan, be induced to go there to\r\nsee whether the palm leaves are still there, and, if they are, to make a\r\ncopy and send it to Oxford?\r\n\r\nF. M. M.\r\n\r\nSECOND POSTSCRIPT: _Oxford, August 2, 1880._\r\n\r\nAt the end of my paper on “Sanskrit Texts in Japan” I mentioned in a\r\npostscript (March 10) that I had received from Mr. Wylie a copy of a\r\nvocabulary called “A Thousand Sanskrit and Chinese Words,” compiled by\r\nI-tsing, about 700 A. D., and brought to Japan by Zikaku, a Japanese\r\npriest, in 847 A. D. The edition of this vocabulary which Mr. Wylie bought\r\nin Japan was published by Jakumio in 1727, and in the preface the editor\r\nsays: “In the temple Hôriuji, in Yamato, there are treasured\r\nPra_gñ_âpâramitâh_ri_daya-sûtram and Sonshio-dhâra_n_î, written on two\r\npalm leaves, handed down, from Central India.”\r\n\r\nHôriuji is one of eleven temples founded by Prince Umayado, who died in A.\r\nD. 621. This temple is in a town named Tatsuta, in the province Yamato,\r\nnear Kioto, the western capital. I ended my article with the following\r\nsentence: “Here, then, we have clear evidence that in the year 1727 palm\r\nleaves containing the text of Sanskrit Sûtras were still preserved in the\r\ntemple of Hôriuji. If that temple is still in existence, might not some\r\nBuddhist priest of Kioto, the western capital of Japan, be induced to go\r\nthere to see whether the palm leaves are still there, and, if they are, to\r\nmake a copy and send it to Oxford?”\r\n\r\nSooner than expected this wish of mine has been fulfilled. On April 28 Mr.\r\nShigefuyu Kurihara, of Kioto, a friend of one of my Sanskrit pupils, Mr.\r\nBunyiu Nanjio, who for some years had himself taken an interest in\r\nSanskrit, went to the temple or monastery of Hôriuji to inquire whether\r\nany old Sanskrit MSS. were still preserved there. He was told that the\r\npriests of the monastery had recently surrendered their valuables to the\r\nImperial Government, and that the ancient palm leaves had been presented\r\nto the emperor.\r\n\r\nIn a chronicle kept at the monastery of Hôriuji it is stated that these\r\npalm leaves and other valuables were brought by Ono Imoko, a retainer of\r\nthe Mikado (the Empress Suiko), from China (during the Sui dynasty,\r\n589-618) to Japan, in the thirty-seventh year of the age of Prince\r\nUmayado—_i. e._, A. D. 609. The other valuable articles were:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Niô, _i. e._, a cymbal used in Buddhist temples;\r\n\r\n    2. Midzu-game, a water vessel;\r\n\r\n    3. Shaku-jio, a staff, the top of which is armed with metal rings,\r\n    as carried by Buddhist priests;\r\n\r\n    4. Kesa (Kashâya), a scarf, worn by Buddhist priests across the\r\n    shoulder, which belonged to the famous Bodhidharma;\r\n\r\n    5. Ha_k_i, a bowl, given by the same Bodhidharma.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese things and the Sanskrit MSS. are said to have belonged to some\r\nChinese priests, named Hwui-sz’ (Yeshi) and Nien-shan (Nenzen), and to\r\nfour others successively, who lived in a monastery on the mountain called\r\nNan-yo (Nangak), in the province of Hăng (Kô) in China. These palm-leaf\r\nMSS. may, therefore, be supposed to date from at least the sixth century\r\nA. D., and be, in fact, _the oldest Sanskrit MSS. now in existence_.(161)\r\n\r\nMay we not hope that His Excellency Mori Arinori, who expressed so warm an\r\ninterest in this matter when he was present at the meeting of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society, will now lend us his powerful aid, and request the\r\nMinister of the Department of the Imperial Household to allow these MSS.\r\nto be carefully copied or photographed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademic freedom not without dangers, 39.\r\n\r\n_Adams_, H.

It was in mounting the steps of the Capitol in\r\n      January, 1855, that the thought first arose of converting it into a\r\n      volume, and it was not published till 1859. The author, who in his\r\n      Autobiography speaks with exquisite modesty of all his literary\r\n      performances, allows himself one single exception when speaking of\r\n      his Essay _On Liberty_. “None of my writings,” he says, “have been\r\n      either so carefully composed or so sedulously corrected as this.”\r\n      Its final revision was to have been the work of the winter of 1858\r\n      to 1859, which he and his wife had arranged to pass in the South of\r\n      Europe, a hope which was frustrated by his wife’s death. “The\r\n      _Liberty_,” he writes, “is likely to survive longer than anything\r\n      else that I have written (with the possible exception of the\r\n      _Logic_), because the conjunction of her mind with mine has rendered\r\n      it a kind of philosophic text-book of a single truth, which the\r\n      changes progressively taking place in modern society tend to bring\r\n      out into strong relief: the importance to man and society, of a\r\n      large variety of character, and of giving full freedom to human\r\n      nature to expand itself in innumerable and conflicting directions.”\r\n\r\n    2 Herzen defined Nihilism as “the most perfect freedom from all\r\n      settled concepts, from all inherited restraints and impediments\r\n      which hamper the progress of the Occidental intellect with the\r\n      historical drag tied to its foot.”\r\n\r\n_    3 Ueber die Akademische Freiheit der Deutschen Universitäten_, Rede\r\n      beim Antritt des Rectorats an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in\r\n      Berlin, am October 15, 1877, gehalten von Dr. H.

Bonwick, 1870, p.\r\n      143.\r\n\r\n   26 The word ψυχή is clearly connected in Greek with ψύχω, which meant\r\n      originally blowing, and was used either in the sense of cooling by\r\n      blowing, or breathing by blowing. In the former acceptation it\r\n      produced ψύχος, coldness; ψυχρός, cold; ψυχάω, I cool; in the latter\r\n      ψυχή, breath, then life, then soul. So far the purely Greek growth\r\n      of words derived from ψύχω is clear. But ψύχω itself is difficult.\r\n      It seems to point to a root _spu_, meaning to blow out, to spit;\r\n      Lat. _spuo_, and _spuma_, foam; Goth, _speivan_; Gr. πτύω, supposed\r\n      to stand for σπιύω. Hesychius mentions ψύττει = πτύει, ψυττόν =\r\n      πτύελον. (Pott, _Etym. Forsch._ No. 355.) Curtius connects this root\r\n      with Gr. φυ, in φῦσα, blowing, bellows, φυσάω, to blow, φυσιάω, to\r\n      snort, ποι-φύσσω, to blow, and with Lat. _spirare_ (_i.e._\r\n      spoisare). See E. B. Tylor, “The Religion of Savages,” _Fortnightly\r\n      Review_, 1866, p. 73.\r\n\r\n      Stahl, who rejected the division of life and mind adopted by Bacon,\r\n      and returned to the Aristotelian doctrine, falls back on Plato’s\r\n      etymology of ψυχή as φυσέχη, from φύσιν ἔχειν or ὀχεῖν, Crat. 400 B.\r\n      In a passage of his _Theoria Medica Vera_ (Halæ, 1708), pointed out\r\n      to me by Dr. Rolleston, Stahl says: “Invenio in lexico græco\r\n      antiquiore post alios, et Budæum imprimis, iterum iterumque reviso,\r\n      nomenclaturam nimis quam fugitive allegatam; φυσέχη, poetice, pro\r\n      ψυχή.

I am responsible for the derivation of\r\n      Niobe, and for the admission of a secondary root _snyu_ or _nyu_,\r\n      and so far I may be either right or wrong. But Signer Ascoli ought\r\n      to have known that the derivation of Gothic _snáiv-s_, Old\r\n      High-German _snéo_, or _snê_, gen. _snêwê-s_, Lithuanian _snèga-s_,\r\n      Slav, _snjeg_, Hib. _sneachd_, from the root _snu_, rests on the\r\n      authority of Bopp (_Glossarium_, 1847, s. v. snu; see also Grimm,\r\n      _Deutsche Grammatik_, ii. p. 700). He ought likewise to have known\r\n      that in 1852 Professor Schweizer-Siedler, in his review of\r\n      Bötticher’s _Arica_ (Kuhn’s _Zeitschrift_, i. p. 479), had pointed\r\n      out that _snigh_ may be considered as a secondary root by the side\r\n      of _snu_ and _snâ_ (cf. σμάω, σμήχω; ψάω, ψήχω; νάω, νήχω). The real\r\n      relation of _snu_ to _snigh_ had been explained as early as 1842 by\r\n      Benfey, _Wurzellexicon_, ii. p. 54; and Signor Ascoli was no doubt\r\n      aware of what Professor Curtius had written on the relation of\r\n      _snigh_ to _snu_ (_Grundzüge der Greichischen Etymologie_, p. 297).\r\n      Signor Ascoli has certainly shown with greater minuteness than his\r\n      predecessors that not only Zend _snizh_ and Lithuanian _snêga-s_,\r\n      but likewise Gothic _snaiv-s_, Greek νίφει, Latin nix, nĭv-is, and\r\n      ninguis, may be derived from _snigh_; but if from _snigh_, a\r\n      secondary development of the root _snu_, we can arrive at νίφ-α and\r\n      at νίβα, the other steps that lead on to Niobe will remain just the\r\n      same.\r\n\r\n   36 At the end of the hymn the poet says:—\r\n\r\n      χαῖρε, ἄναξ, πρόφρων δὲ βίον θυμήρε᾽ ὄπαζε;\r\n      ἐκ σέο δ᾽ ἀρξάμενος κλῄσω μερόπων γένος ἀνδρῶν\r\n      ἡμιθέων, ὦν ἔργα θεοὶ θνητοῖσιν ἔδειξαν.\r\n\r\n      This would seem to imply that the poet looked upon Helios as a\r\n      half-god, almost as a hero, who had once lived on earth.\r\n\r\n   37 Corssen, _Ueber Steigerungsendungen_, Kuhn’s _Zeitschrift_, iii. p.\r\n      299.\r\n\r\n   38 See _Selected Essays_, vol. i. p. 399.\r\n\r\n_   39 The Childhood of the World_, by E.

As a curious coincidence, it may be mentioned\r\n      that in Sanskrit, too, the Moon is called _sasāanka_, _i. e._\r\n      “having the marks of a hare,” the black marks in the moon being\r\n      taken for the likeness of the hare. Another coincidence is that the\r\n      Namaqua Hottentots will not touch hare’s flesh (see Sir James E.\r\n      Alexander’s _Expedition of Discovery into the Interior of Africa_,\r\n      vol. i. p. 269), because the hare deceived men, while the Jews\r\n      abstain from it, because the hare is supposed to chew the cud (Lev.\r\n      xi. 6).\r\n\r\n      A similar tradition on the meaning of death occurs among the Zulus,\r\n      but as they do not know of the Moon as a deity, the message that men\r\n      are not to die, or that they are to die, is sent there by\r\n      Unkulunkulu, the ancestor of the human race, and thus the whole\r\n      story loses its point.

Bertram (_Ilmatar_, Dorpat, 1870, p. 265)\r\n      remarks that _Koit_ is the dawn, _Koido täht,_ the morning-star,\r\n      also called _eha täht_. _Ämarik_, the ordinary name for the dawn, is\r\n      used as the name for the evening twilight, or the gloaming in the\r\n      well-known story, published by Fählmann (_Verhandlungen der\r\n      gelehrten Estnischen Gesellschaft zu Dorpat_, vol. i.)

And here is a lesson which\r\n      comparative mythologists ought not to neglect. They are naturally\r\n      bent on explaining everything that can be explained; but they should\r\n      bear in mind that there may be elements in every mythological riddle\r\n      which resist etymological analysis, for the simple reason that their\r\n      origin was not etymological, but historical.”\r\n\r\n_   46 Lectures on the Science of Language_, vol. ii. p. 581.\r\n\r\n   47 Professor Blackie quotes Pausanias in support of this etymology. He\r\n      says: “The account of Pausanias (viii. 25, 26), according to which\r\n      the terrible impersonation of conscience, or the violated moral law,\r\n      is derived from ἐρινύειν, an old Greek verb originally signifying to\r\n      be angry, has sufficient probability, not to mention the obvious\r\n      analogy of Ἀραί, another name sometimes given to the awful maids\r\n      (σεμναί), from ἀρά, an imprecation.” If Professor Blackie will refer\r\n      to Pausanias himself, he will find that the Arcadians assigned a\r\n      very different cause to the anger of Demeter, which is supposed to\r\n      have led to the formation of her new name Erinys.\r\n\r\n_   48 Asiatic Researches, i._ p. 272; _Life of Sir W.

Very\r\n      similar opinions had been advocated by Rajendralal Mitra, in a paper\r\n      published in 1858 in the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_,\r\n      “Buddhism and Odinism, illustrated by extracts from Professor\r\n      Holmboe’s Memoir on the _Traces du Buddhisme en Norvège_.” How much\r\n      mischief is done by opinions of this kind when they once find their\r\n      way into the general public, and are supported by names which carry\r\n      weight, may be seen by the following extracts from the _Pioneer_\r\n      (July 30, 1878), a native paper published in India. Here we read\r\n      that the views of Holmboe, Rajendralal Mitra, and Fergusson, as to a\r\n      possible connection between Buddha and Wodan, between Buddhism and\r\n      Wodenism, have been adopted and preached by an English bishop, in\r\n      order to convince his hearers, who were chiefly Buddhists, that the\r\n      religion of the gentle ascetic came originally, if not from the\r\n      Northeast of Scotland, at all events from the Saxons. “Gotama\r\n      Buddha,” he maintained, “was a Saxon,” coming from “a Saxon family\r\n      which had penetrated into India.” And again: “The most convincing\r\n      proof to us Anglo-Indians lies in the fact that the Purânas named\r\n      Varada and Matsy distinctly assert that the White Island in the\r\n      West—meaning England—was known in India as Sacana, having been\r\n      conquered at a very early period by the Sacas or Saks.” After this\r\n      the bishop takes courage, and says: “Let me call your attention to\r\n      the Pâli word _Nibban_, called in Sanskirt Nirv_âna_. In the\r\n      Anglo-Saxon you have the identical word—Nabban, meaning ‘not to\r\n      have,’ or ‘to be without a thing.’ ”\r\n\r\n   53 See _Buddhaghosha’s Parables_, translated by Captain Rogers, with an\r\n      Introduction containing Buddha’s Dhammapada, translated from Pâli,\r\n      by M.

He writes:—\r\n\r\n      WASHINGTON, _Nov. 9, 1872._\r\n\r\n      “The article by Max Müller in the _Index_ of this week contains, I\r\n      think, one error, caused doubtless by his taking a false translation\r\n      of a passage from Josephus instead of the original. ‘In fact,’ says\r\n      Professor Müller, ‘Josephus (_Contra Apion._ ii. 39) was able to say\r\n      that there was no town, Greek or not Greek, where the custom of\r\n      observing the seventh day had not spread.’ Mr. Wm. B. Taylor, in a\r\n      discussion of the Sabbath question with the Rev. Dr. Brown, of\r\n      Philadelphia, in 1853 (_Obligation of the Sabbath_, p. 120), gives\r\n      this rendering of the passage: ‘Nor is there anywhere any city of\r\n      the Greeks, nor a single barbarian nation, whither the institution\r\n      of the Hebdomade (_which we mark by resting_) has not travelled;’\r\n      then in a note Mr. Taylor gives the original Greek of part of the\r\n      passage, and adds: ‘Josephus does not say that the Greek and\r\n      barbarian rested, but that _we_ [the Jews] observe it by rest.’\r\n\r\n      “The corrected translation only adds strength to Max Müller’s\r\n      position in regard to the very limited extent of Sabbath observance\r\n      in ancient times; and Mr. Taylor brings very strong historical proof\r\n      to maintain the assertion (p. 24) that ‘throughout all history we\r\n      discover no trace of a Sabbath among the nations of antiquity.’ ”\r\n\r\n      It seems to me that if we read the whole of Josephus’s work, _On the\r\n      Antiquity of the Jews_, we cannot fail to perceive that what\r\n      Josephus wished to show towards the end of the second book was that\r\n      other nations had copied or were trying to copy the Jewish customs.\r\n      He says: Ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν τε διηνέχθησαν οἱ νόμοι καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν\r\n      ἀνθρώποις, ἀεὶ καὶ μᾶλλον αὐτῶν ζῆλον ἐμπεποιήκασι. He then says\r\n      that the early Greek philosophers, though apparently original in\r\n      their theoretic speculations, followed the Jewish laws with regard\r\n      to practical and moral precepts. Then follows this sentence: Οὐ μὴν\r\n      ἀλλὰ καὶ πλήθεσιν ἤδη πολὺς ζῆλος γέγονεν ἐκ μακροῦ τῆς ἡμετέρας\r\n      εὐσεβείας, οὐ δ᾽ ἔστιν οὐ πόλις Ἑλλήνων οὐδετισουν οὐδὲ βάρβαρος,\r\n      οὐδὲ ἕν ἔθνος, ἔνθα μὴ τὸ τῆς ἑβδομάδος, ἥν ἀργοῦμεν ἡμεῖς, ἔθος οὐ\r\n      διαπεφοιτηκε, καὶ αἱ νηστεῖαι καὶ λύχνων ἀνακαύσεις καὶ πολλὰ τῶν\r\n      εἰς βρῶσιν ἡμῖν οὐ νενομισμένων παρατετήρηται. Μιμεῖσθαι δὲ\r\n      πειρῶνται καὶ τὴν πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἡμῶν ὁμόνοιαν, κ.τ.λ. Standing where\r\n      it stands, the sentence about the ἑβδομάς can only mean that “there\r\n      is no town of Greeks nor of barbarians, nor one single people, where\r\n      the custom of the seventh day, on which we rest, has not spread, and\r\n      where fastings, and lighting of lamps, and much of what is forbidden\r\n      to us with regard to food are not observed. They try to imitate our\r\n      mutual concord also, etc.” Hebdomas, which originally meant the\r\n      week, is here clearly used in the sense of the seventh day, and\r\n      though Josephus may exaggerate, what he says is certainty “that\r\n      there was no town, Greek or not Greek, where the custom of observing\r\n      the seventh day had not spread.”\r\n\r\n   56 Grimm, _Deutsche Mythologie_, p. 118, note.\r\n\r\n   57 In Singalese Wednesday is Badâ, in Tamil Budau.

When invited to go to China, the King would not let him\r\n      depart. He left secretly, and arrived in China after Kâsyapa. They\r\n      translated the Sûtra in forty-two sections together.

In that case their Sanskrit names were mostly\r\n      translated into two Chinese characters: as Fâ, (law = dharma), hu\r\n      (protection = raksha).—B. N.\r\n\r\n   92 According to Mr. Beal (Fahian, p. xxiii.), this _K_û-fâ-hu, with the\r\n      help of other Shâmans, translated no less than 165 texts, and among\r\n      them the Lalita-vistara (Pou-yao-king), the Nirvâ_n_a Sûtra, and the\r\n      Suvar_n_a-prabhâsa-Sûtra (265-308). The K’ai-yuen-lu assigns to him\r\n      275 works, in 354 fascicles.\r\n\r\n   93 Edkins, _l. c._ Beal, _Catalogue_, p. 17; 14.\r\n\r\n   94 Edkins, _l. c._\r\n\r\n   95 The Yâos subdued the Fûs, and ruled as the dynasty of the After\r\n      _Kh_in.\r\n\r\n   96 See p. 208. He is sometimes called Balasan, or, according to Edkins,\r\n      Palat’sanga, Baddala, or Dabadara. In the Fan-i-ming-i-tsi (vol.\r\n      iii. fol. 6) the following account of Buddhabhadra is given:\r\n      “Buddhabhadra met Kumâra_g_iva in China, and whenever the latter\r\n      found any doubts, the former was always asked for an explanation. In\r\n      the fourteenth year of Î-hsi (418 A. D.) Buddhabhadra translated the\r\n      Fa-yan-king in sixty volumes.” This Sûtra is the\r\n      Ta-fang-kwang-fo-fa-yan-king, Buddhâvata_m_saka-vai-pulya-sûtra\r\n      (Beal’s _Catalogue_, p. 9). This translation was brought to Japan in\r\n      736.\r\n\r\n   97 The Sang-_k_i-liu, rules of priesthood; _i. e._ the Vinaya of the\r\n      Mahâsaṅghika school.\r\n\r\n   98 I call him Dharmaraksha II., in order to prevent a confusion which\r\n      has been produced by identifying two Shâmans who lived at a distance\r\n      of nearly 200 years—the one 250 A. D., the other 420 A. D. The first\r\n      is called _K_û-fâ-hu, which can be rendered Dharmaraksha; the second\r\n      is called Fâ-făng (law-prosperity), but, if transliterated, he is\r\n      best known by the names T‘on-mo-la-tsin, T‘an-mo-tsin, or\r\n      Dharmalatsin. He was a native of Central India, and arrived in China\r\n      in the first year of the period Hiouen-shi of the Tsü-_kh_u family\r\n      of the Northern Liang, 414 A. D. He was the contemporary of\r\n      _K_i-mang, whom Mr. Beal places about 250 A. D., in order to make\r\n      him a contemporary of Dharmaraksha I.\r\n\r\n   99 Mung-sun died 432, and was succeeded by his heir, who lost his\r\n      kingdom in 439. Yâo-_kh_ang’s kingdom, however, was destroyed by the\r\n      Eastern Tsin, at the time of his second successor, 417, not by\r\n      Mung-sun.\r\n\r\n  100 It is said in the tenth year of the period Hung-shi of Yâo-_kh_ang\r\n      (better hsing), the copy arrived at _Kh_ang-an. But this cannot be,\r\n      if _K_i-mang went to India in 419. There must be something wrong in\r\n      these dates.\r\n\r\n  101 The four Nikâyas or Âgamas; _cf._ Vinayapi_t_aka, vol. i. p. xl.\r\n\r\n_  102 S_âriputrâbhidharma-_s_âstra; _cf._ Beal, _Catalogue_, p. 80.\r\n\r\n  103 Beal, _Catalogue_, p. 36.\r\n\r\n  104 Edkins, _l. c._\r\n\r\n_  105 Ibid._\r\n\r\n  106 Beal, _Catalogue_, p. 77; on p. 20 a translation of the Lankâvatâra\r\n      is mentioned.\r\n\r\n  107 See _Athenæum_, August 7, 1880; and _infra_, p. 370.\r\n\r\n  108 A long list of Sanskrit texts translated into Chinese may be found\r\n      in the _Journal Asiatique_, 1849, p. 353 _seq._, _s. t._\r\n      “Concordance Sinico-Samskrite d’un nombre considérable de titres\r\n      d’ouvrages Bouddhiques, recueillie dans un Catalogue Chinois de l’an\r\n      1306, par M.

The lines run always parallel to the narrow side\r\n      of the leaf, and the MSS. present, therefore, the appearance of\r\n      European books, not of Indian MSS., which owe their form to an\r\n      imitation of the Tâlapatras. The Himâlaya seems to contain an\r\n      inexhaustible supply of birch bark, which in Kasmîr and other hill\r\n      countries is used both instead of paper by the shopkeepers in the\r\n      bazaars, and for lining the roofs of houses in order to make them\r\n      water-tight. It is also exported to India, where in many places it\r\n      is likewise used for wrapping up parcels, and plays an important\r\n      part in the manufacture of the flexible pipe-stems used by hukâ\r\n      smokers. To give an idea of the quantities which are brought into\r\n      Srînagar, I may mention that on one single day I counted fourteen\r\n      large barges with birch bark on the river.... The use of birch bark\r\n      for literary purposes is attested by the earliest classical Sanskrit\r\n      writers. Kâlidâsa mentions it in his dramas and epics; Sustuta,\r\n      Varâhamihira (_circa_ 500-550 A. D.) know it likewise. As is the\r\n      case with nearly all old customs, the use of birch bark for writing\r\n      still survives in India, though the fact is little known. Mantras,\r\n      which are worn as amulets, are written on pieces of Bhûrga with\r\n      ash_t_au gandbâ_h_, a mixture of eight odoriferous substances—_e.\r\n      g._ camphor, sandal, tumeric—which vary according to the deity to\r\n      which the writing is dedicated. The custom prevails in Bengal as\r\n      well as in Gujarât. Birch-bark MSS. occur in Orissa. The Petersburg\r\n      Dictionary refers to a passage in the Kâ_th_aka, the redaction of\r\n      the Yajurveda formerly current in Kasmîr, where the word Bhûr_g_a\r\n      occurs, though it is not clear if it is mentioned there too as\r\n      material for writing on. The Kasmirian Pandits assert, and\r\n      apparently with good reason, that in Kasmîr all books were written\r\n      on bhûrgapattras from the earliest times until after the conquest of\r\n      the Valley by Akbar, about 200-250 years ago. Akbar introduced the\r\n      manufacture of paper, and thus created an industry for which Kasmîr\r\n      is now famous in India.”\r\n\r\n  116 Dr. Burnell, _Indian Antiquary_, 1880, p. 234, shows that\r\n      Koṅka_n_apura is Koṅka_n_ah_ll_i in the Mysore territory.\r\n\r\n  117 Beal’s _Travels of Buddhist Pilgrims_, Introd. p. xlvi.\r\n\r\n_  118 Pèterins Buuddhistes_, vol. i. p. 158.\r\n\r\n  119 Fausböll, _Dasaratha-jā_taka, p. 25.\r\n\r\n  120 See, also, Albiruni, as quoted by Reinaud, _Memoir sur l’Inde_, p.\r\n      305.\r\n\r\n  121 See Letter to the _Times_, “On the Religions of Japan,” Oct. 20,\r\n      1880.\r\n\r\n  122 “Le Bouddhisme dans l’extrème Orient,” _Revue Scientifique_,\r\n      Décembre, 1879.\r\n\r\n_  123 Journal Asiatique_, 1871, p. 386 _seq._\r\n\r\n  124 Five of these translations were introduced into Japan; the others\r\n      seem to have been lost in China.

Beal,\r\n      _Catalogue_, p. 77, mentions also an\r\n      Amitâbha-sûtra-upade_s_a-_s_âstra, by Vasubandhu, translated by\r\n      Bodhiru_k_i (Wou-liang-sheu-king-yeou-po-ti-she). There is an\r\n      Amitâbha-sûtra, translated by Chi-hien of the Wu period—_i. e._\r\n      222-280 A. D.—mentioned in Mr. Beal’s _Catalogue of the Buddhist\r\n      Tripitaka_, p. 6. The next Sûtra, which he calls the Sûtra of\r\n      measureless years, is no doubt the Amitâyus-sûtra, Amitâyus being\r\n      another name for Amitâbha (Fu-shwo-wou-liang-sheu-king, p. 6). See,\r\n      also, _Catalogue_, pp. 99, 102. Dr. Edkins also, in his _Notices of\r\n      Buddhism in China_, speaks of a translation of “the Sûtra of\r\n      boundless age,” by Fa-t’ian-pun, a native of Magadha, who was\r\n      assisted in his translation by a native of China familiar with\r\n      Sanskrit, about 1000 A. D.\r\n\r\n_  135 S_râvastî, capital of the Northern Ko_s_alas, residence of King\r\n      Prasena_g_it. It was in ruins when visited by Fa-hian (init. V.\r\n      Sæc.); not far from the modern Fizabad. _Cf._ Burnouf,\r\n      _Introduction_, p. 22.\r\n\r\n  136 Sârdha, with, the Pâli saddhim. Did not the frequent mention of\r\n      1,200 and a half (_i. e._ 1,250), 1,300 and a half (_i. e._ 1,350),\r\n      persons accompanying Buddha arise from a misunderstanding of sârdha,\r\n      meaning originally “with a half”?\r\n\r\n  137 Abhi_gñ_ânâbhi_gñ_âtai_h_. The Japanese text reads\r\n      abhi_gñ_âtâbhâ_gñ_âtai_h_—_i. e._ abhi_gñ_âtâbhi_gñ_âtai_h_. If this\r\n      were known to be the correct reading, we should translate it by\r\n      “known by known people,” _notus a viris notis_—_i. e._ well-known,\r\n      famous. Abhi_gñ_âta in the sense of known, famous, occurs in\r\n      Lalita-Vistara, p. 25, and the Chinese translators adopted that\r\n      meaning here. Again, if we preferred the reading\r\n      abhi_gñ_ânâbhi_gñ_âtai_h_, this, too, would admit of an intelligible\r\n      rendering—viz. known or distinguished by the marks or\r\n      characteristics, the good qualities, that ought to belong to a\r\n      Bhikshu. But the technical meaning is “possessed of a knowledge of\r\n      the five abhi_gñ_âs.” It would be better in that case to write\r\n      abhi_gñ_âtâbhi_gñ_ânai_h_, but no MSS. seem to support that reading.\r\n      The five abhi_gñ_âs or abhi_gñ_ânas which an Arhat ought to possess\r\n      are the divine sight, the divine hearing, the knowledge of the\r\n      thoughts of others, the remembrance of former existences, and magic\r\n      power. See Burnouf, _Lotus_, Appendice, No. xiv. The larger text of\r\n      the Sukhavatîvyûha has abhi_gñ_ânâbhi_gñ_aih, and afterwards\r\n      abhi_gñ_âtâbhi_gñ_ai_h_. The position of the participle as the\r\n      uttara-pada in such compounds as abhi_gñ_ânâbhi_gñ_âtai_h_ is common\r\n      in Buddhist Sanskrit. Mr. Bendall has called my attention to the\r\n      Pâli abhi_ññ_âta-abhi_ññ_âta (Vinaya-pi_t_aka, ed. Oldenberg, vol.\r\n      i. p. 43), which favors the Chinese acceptation of the term.\r\n\r\n  138 Mahâsrâvaka, the great disciples; sometimes the eighty principal\r\n      disciples.\r\n\r\n  139 Arhadbhi_h_. I have left the correct Sanskrit form, because the\r\n      Japanese text gives the termination adbhi_h_. Hôgŏ’s text has the\r\n      more usual form arhantai_h_. The change of the old classical arhat\r\n      into the Pâli arahan, and then back into Sanskrit arhanta, arahanta,\r\n      and at last arihanta, with the meaning of “destroyer of the\r\n      enemies”—_i. e._ the passions—shows very clearly the different\r\n      stages through which Sanskrit words passed in the different phases\r\n      of Buddhist literature. In Tibet, in Mongolia, and in China, Arhat\r\n      is translated by “destroyer of the enemy.” See Burnouf, _Lotus_, p.\r\n      287; _Introduction_, p. 295. Arhat is the title of the Bhikshu on\r\n      reaching the fourth degree of perfection. _Cf._ Sûtra of the 42\r\n      Sections, cap. 2. Clemens of Alexandria (d. 220) speaks of the\r\n      Σεμνοι who worshipped a pyramid erected over the relics of a god. Is\r\n      this a translation of Arhat, as Lassen (“De nom. Ind. philosoph.” in\r\n      _Rhein. Museum_, vol. i. p. 187) and Burnouf (_Introduction_, p.\r\n      295) supposed, or a transliteration of Samana? Clemens also speaks\r\n      of Σεμναί (_Stromat._ p. 539, Potter).\r\n\r\n  140 Indra, the old Vedic god, has come to mean simply lord, and in the\r\n      _K_anda Paritta (_Journal Asiatique_, 1871, p. 220) we actually find\r\n      Asurinda, the Indra or Lord of the Asuras.\r\n\r\n  141 The numbers in Buddhist literature, if they once exceed a Ko_t_i or\r\n      Ko_t_î—_i. e._ ten millions—become very vague, nor is their value\r\n      always the same. Ayuta, _i. e._ a hundred Ko_t_is; Niyuta, _i. e._ a\r\n      hundred Ayutas; and Nayuta, _i. e._ 1 with 22 zeros, are often\r\n      confounded; nor does it matter much so far as any definite idea is\r\n      concerned which such numerals convey to our mind.\r\n\r\n  142 Tish_th_ati dh_riy_ate yâpayati dharma_m_ _k_a desayati. This is\r\n      evidently an idiomatic phrase, for it occurs again and again in the\r\n      Nepalese text of the Sukhavatîvyûha (MS. 26 _b_, l. 1. 2; 55 _a_, l.\r\n      2, etc.). It seems to mean, he stands there, holds himself, supports\r\n      himself, and teaches the law. Burnouf translates the same phrase by,\r\n      “ils se trouvent, vivent existent” (_Lotus_, p. 354). On yâpeti in\r\n      Pâli, see Fausböll, Dasaratha-jâtaka, pp. 26, 28; and yâpana in\r\n      Sanskrit.\r\n\r\n  143 Kiṅki_n_î_g_âla. The texts read kaṅka_n_î_g_alais _k_a and\r\n      kaṅka_n_îgalais _k_a, and again later kaṅka_n_îgalunâm (also lû) and\r\n      kaṅka_n_î_g_alânâm. Mr. Beal translates from Chinese “seven rows of\r\n      exquisite curtains,” and again “gemmous curtains.” First of all, it\r\n      seems clear that we must read _g_âla, net, web, instead of _g_ala.\r\n      Secondly, kaṅka_n_a, bracelet, gives no sense, for what could be the\r\n      meaning of nets or string of bracelets? I prefer to read\r\n      kiṅki_n_î_g_âla, nets or strings or rows of bells. Such rows of\r\n      bells served for ornamenting a garden, and it may be said of them\r\n      that, if moved by the wind, they give forth certain sounds. In the\r\n      commentary on Dhammapada 30, p. 191, we meet with kiṅkinika_g_âla,\r\n      from which likewise the music proceeds; see Childers, _s. v. g_âla.\r\n      In the MSS. of the Nepalese Sukhavatîvyûha (_R. A. S._), p. 39 _a_,\r\n      l. 4, I likewise find svarnaratnakiṅki_n_î_g_âlâni, which settles\r\n      the matter, and shows how little confidence we can place in the\r\n      Japanese texts.\r\n\r\n  144 Anuparikshipta, inclosed; see parikkhepo in Childers’ Dict.\r\n\r\n  145 The eight good qualities of water are limpidity and purity,\r\n      refreshing coolness, sweetness, softness, fertilizing qualities,\r\n      calmness, power of preventing famine, productiveness. See Beal,\r\n      _Catena_, p. 379.\r\n\r\n  146 Kâkâpeya. One text reads Kâkapeya, the other Kâkâpeya. It is\r\n      difficult to choose. The more usual word is kâkapeya, which is\r\n      explained by Pâ_n_ini, ii. 1, 33. It is uncertain, however, whether\r\n      kâkapeya is meant as a laudatory or as a depreciatory term.\r\n      Boehtlingk takes it in the latter sense, and translates nadî\r\n      kâkapeyâ, by a shallow river that could be drunk up by a crow.\r\n      Târânâtha takes it in the former sense, and translates nadî\r\n      kâkapeyâ, as a river so full of water that a crow can drink it\r\n      without bending its neck (kâkair anatakandharai_h_ pîyate;\r\n      pûr_n_odakatvena pra_s_asye kâkai_h_ peye nadyâdau). In our passage\r\n      kâkapeya must be a term of praise, and we therefore could only\r\n      render it by “ponds so full of water that crows could drink from\r\n      them.” But why should so well known a word as kâkapeya have been\r\n      spelt kâkâpeya, unless it was done intentionally? And if\r\n      intentionally, what was it intended for? We must remember that\r\n      Pâ_n_ini, ii. 1, 42 schol., teaches us how to form the word\r\n      tîrthakâka, a crow at a tîrtha, which means a person in a wrong\r\n      place. It would seem, therefore, that crows were considered out of\r\n      place at a tîrtha or bathing-place, either because they were birds\r\n      of ill omen, or because they defiled the water. From that point of\r\n      view, kâkâpeya would mean a pond not visited by crows, free from\r\n      crows. Professor Pischel has called my attention to Mahâparinibbâna\r\n      Sutta (_J. R. A. S._ 1875, p. 67, p. 21), where kâkapeyâ clearly\r\n      refers to a full river. Samatiṭṭḥika, if this is the right reading,\r\n      occurs in the same place as an epithet of a river, by the side of\r\n      kâkapeya, and I think it most likely that it means rising to a level\r\n      with the tîrthas, the fords or bathing-places. Mr. Rhys Davids\r\n      informs me that the commentary explains the two words by samatittikâ\r\n      ti samaharitâ, kâkapeyyâ ti yatthatattha_k_i tîre _th_itena kâkena\r\n      sakkâ patum ti.\r\n\r\n  147 Purobhaktena. The text is difficult to read, but it can hardly be\r\n      doubtful that purobhaktena corresponds to Pâli purebhatta_m_ (_i.\r\n      e._ before the morning meal), opposed to pa_kkh_âbhatta_m_, after\r\n      the noonday meal (_i. e._ in the afternoon). See Childers, _s. v._\r\n      Pûrvabhaktikâ would be the first repast, as Professor Cowell informs\r\n      me.\r\n\r\n  148 Divâ vihârâya, for the noonday rest, the _siesta_. See Childers, _s.\r\n      v._ vihâra.\r\n\r\n  149 Krau_ñk_â_h_. Snipe, curlew. Is it meant for Kuravîka, or Karavîka,\r\n      a fine-voiced bird (according to Kern, the Sk. karâyikâ), or for\r\n      Kalaviṅka-Pâli Kalavîka? See Childers, _s. v._ opapâtiko; Burnouf,\r\n      _Lotus_, p. 566. I see, however, the same birds mentioned together\r\n      elsewhere, as ha_m_sakrau_ñk_amayûra_s_uka_s_âlikakokila, etc. On\r\n      mayûra see Mahâv. Introd. p. xxxix.; Rv. I. 191, 14.\r\n\r\n  150 Indriyabalabodhyaṅgasabda. These are technical terms, but their\r\n      meaning is not quite clear. Spence Hardy, in his _Manual_, p. 498,\r\n      enumerates the five indrayas, viz. (1) sardhâwa, purity (probably\r\n      _s_raddhâ, faith), (2) wiraya, persevering exertion (vîrya), (3)\r\n      sati or smirti, the ascertainment of truth (sm_ri_ti), (4) samâdhi,\r\n      tranquillity, (5) pragnâwa, wisdom (pra_gñ_â).\r\n\r\n      The five balayas (bala), he adds, are the same as the five indrayas.\r\n\r\n      The seven bowdyânga (bodhyaṅga) are, according to him: (1) sihi or\r\n      smirti, the ascertainment of the truth by mental application, (2)\r\n      dharmmawicha, the investigation of causes. (3) wîraya, persevering\r\n      exertion, (4) prîti, joy, (5) passadhi, or prasrabdhi, tranquillity,\r\n      (6) samâdhi, tranquillity in a higher degree, including freedom from\r\n      all that disturbs either body or mind, (7) upekshâ, equanimity.\r\n\r\n      It will be seen from this that some of these qualities or\r\n      excellences occur both as indriyas and bodhyaṅgas, while balas are\r\n      throughout identical with indriyas.\r\n\r\n      Burnouf, however, in his _Lotus_, gives a list of five balas (from\r\n      the _Vocabulaire Pentaglotte_) which correspond with the five\r\n      indriyas of Spence Hardy: viz. _s_raddhâ-bala, power of faith,\r\n      vîrya-bala, power of vigor, sm_ri_ti-bala, power of memory,\r\n      samâdhi-bala, power of meditation, pra_gñ_â-bala, power of\r\n      knowledge. They precede the seven bodhyaṅgas both in the _Lotus_,\r\n      the _Vocabulaire Pentaglotte_, and the Lalita-Vistara.\r\n\r\n      To these seven bodhyaṅgas Burnouf has assigned a special treatise\r\n      (Appendix xii. p. 796). They occur both in Sanskrit and Pâli.\r\n\r\n  151 Niraya, the hells, also called Naraka. Yamaloka, the realm of Yama,\r\n      the judge of the dead, is explained as the four Apâyas—_i. e._\r\n      Naraka, hell, Tiryagyoni, birth as animals, Pretaloka, realm of the\r\n      dead, Asuraloka, realm of evil spirits. The three terms which are\r\n      here used together occur likewise in a passage translated by\r\n      Burnouf, _Introduction_, p. 544.\r\n\r\n  152 Iti sankhyâ_m_ ga_kkh_anti, they are called; _cf._ Childers, _s. v._\r\n      sankhyâ. Asankhyeya, even more than aprameya, is the recognized term\r\n      for infinity. Burnouf, _Lotus_, p. 852.\r\n\r\n  153 Avaramâtraka. This is the Pâli oramattako, “belonging merely to the\r\n      present life,” and the intention of the writer seems to be to\r\n      inculcate the doctrine of the Mahâyâna, that salvation can be\r\n      obtained by mere repetitions of the name of Amitâbha, in direct\r\n      opposition to the original doctrine of Buddha, that as a man soweth,\r\n      so he reapeth. Buddha would have taught that the ku_s_alamûla, the\r\n      root or the stock of good works performed in this world\r\n      (avaramâtraka), will bear fruit in the next, while here “vain\r\n      repetitions” seems all that is enjoined. The Chinese translators\r\n      take a different view of this passage, and I am not myself quite\r\n      certain that I have understood it rightly. But from the end of this\r\n      section, where we read kulaputre_n_a vâ kuladuhitrâ vâ tatra\r\n      buddhakshetre _k_ittaprâ_n_idhâna_m_ kartavyam, it seems clear that\r\n      the locative (buddhakshetre) forms the object of the pra_n_idhâna,\r\n      the fervent prayer or longing. The Satpurushas already in the\r\n      Buddhakshetra would be the innumerable men (manushyâs) and\r\n      Boddhisattvas mentioned before.\r\n\r\n  154 Arthavasa, lit. the power of the thing; _cf._ Dhammapada, p. 388,\r\n      _v._ 289.\r\n\r\n  155 I am not quite certain as to the meaning of this passage, but if we\r\n      enter into the bold metaphor of the text, viz., that the Buddhas\r\n      cover the Buddha-countries with the organ of their tongue and then\r\n      unroll it, what is intended can hardly be anything but that they\r\n      first try to find words for the excellences of those countries, and\r\n      then reveal or proclaim them. Burnouf, however (_Lotus_, p. 417),\r\n      takes the expression in a literal sense, though he is shocked by its\r\n      grotesqueness. On these Buddhas and their countries, see Burnouf,\r\n      _Lotus_, p. 113.\r\n\r\n  156 It should be remarked that the Tathâgatas here assigned to the ten\r\n      quarters differ entirely from those assigned to them in the\r\n      Lalita-vistara, book xx. Not even Amitâbha is mentioned there.\r\n\r\n  157 Pratîyatha. The texts give again and again pattîyatha, evidently the\r\n      Pâli form, instead of pratîyata. I have left tha, the Pâli\r\n      termination of the 2 p. pl. in the imperative, instead of ta,\r\n      because that form was clearly intended, while pa for pra may be an\r\n      accident. Yet I have little doubt that patîyatha was in the original\r\n      text. That it is meant for the imperative, we see from\r\n      _s_raddadhâdhvam, etc., farther on. Other traces of the influence of\r\n      Pâli or Prakrit on the Sanskrit of our Sûtra appear in arhantai_h_,\r\n      the various reading for arhadbhi_h_, which I preferred; sambahula\r\n      for bahula; dh_ri_yate yâpayati; purobhaktena; anyatra; saṅkhyâm\r\n      ga_kkh_anti; avaramâtraka; ve_th_ana instead of vesh_t_ana, in\r\n      nirve_th_ana; dharmaparyâya (_Corp. Inscript._ plate XV.), etc.\r\n\r\n  158 The Sukhavatîvyûha, even in its shortest text, is called a\r\n      Mahâyâna-sûtra, nor is there any reason why a Mahâyâna-sûtra should\r\n      not be short. The meaning of Mahâyâna-sûtra is simply a Sûtra\r\n      belonging to the Mahâyâna school, the school of the Great Boat. It\r\n      was Burnouf who, in his _Introduction to the History of Buddhism_,\r\n      tried very hard to establish a distinction between the Vaipulya or\r\n      developed Sûtras, and what he calls the simple Sûtras. Now, the\r\n      Vaipulya Sûtras may all belong to the Mahâyâna school, but that\r\n      would not prove that all the Sûtras of the Mahâyâna school are\r\n      Vaipulya or developed Sûtras. The name of simple Sûtra, in\r\n      opposition to the Vaipulya or developed Sûtras, is not recognized by\r\n      the Buddhists themselves; it is really an invention of Burnouf’s. No\r\n      doubt there is a great difference between a Vaipulya Sûtra, such as\r\n      the Lotus of the Good Law, translated by Burnouf, and the Sûtras\r\n      which Burnouf translated from the Divyâvadâna. But what Burnouf\r\n      considers as the distinguishing mark of a Vaipulya Sûtra, viz. the\r\n      occurrence of Bodhisattvas, as followers of the Buddha _S_âkyamuni,\r\n      would no longer seem to be tenable (“Les présence des Bodhisattûvas\r\n      ou leur absence intéresse done le fonds même des livres où on la\r\n      remarque, et il est bien évident que ce seul point trace une ligno\r\n      de démarcation profonde entre les Sûtras ordinaires et les Sûtras\r\n      développés.” Burnouf. _Introduction_, p. 112.), unless we classed\r\n      our short Sukhavatî-vyûha as a Vaipulya or developed Sûtra. For this\r\n      there is no authority. Our Sûtra is called a Mahâyâna Sutra, never a\r\n      Vaipulya Sûtra, and yet among the followers of Buddha, the\r\n      Bodhisattvas constitute a very considerable portion. But more than\r\n      that, Amitâbha, the Buddha of Sukhavatî, another personage whom\r\n      Burnouf looks upon as peculiar to the Vaipulya Sûtras, who is, in\r\n      fact, one of the Dhyâni-buddhas, though not called by that name in\r\n      our Sûtra, forms the chief object of its teaching, and is\r\n      represented as coeval with Buddha _S_âkyamuni. (“L’idée d’un ou de\r\n      plusieurs Buddhas surhumains, celle de Bodhisattvas créés par eux,\r\n      sont des conceptions aussi étrangères á ces livres (les Sûtras\r\n      simples) que celle d’un Adibuddha ou d’un Dieu.”—Burnouf,\r\n      _Introduction_, p. 120.) The larger text of the Sukhavatîvyûha would\r\n      certainly, according to Burnouf’s definition, seem to fall into the\r\n      category of the Vaipulya Sûtras. But it is not so called in the MSS.\r\n      which I have seen, and Burnouf himself gives an analysis of that\r\n      Sûtra (_Introduction_, p. 99) as a specimen of a Mahâyâna, but not\r\n      of a Vaipulya Sûtra.\r\n\r\n  159 See H. Yule, _Marco Polo_, 2d ed. vol. i. pp. 441-443.\r\n\r\n  160 In China, as Dr. Edkins states, the doctrine of Amitâbha is\r\n      represented by the so-called Lotus school (Lian-tsung) or Pure Land\r\n      (Tsing-tu). The founder of this school in China was Hwei-yuan of the\r\n      Tsin dynasty (fourth century). The second patriarch (tsu) of this\r\n      school was Kwang-ming (seventh century).\r\n\r\n  161 See page 191.",
