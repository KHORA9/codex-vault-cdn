H. WHEELER, D.D., LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo _us_ the unit of speech is the word; historically, the unit is the\r\nsentence. It matters little which of the theories respecting the first\r\nforms of speech we adopt; all such theories may be rejected, and still we\r\nshall find it most reasonable to believe that man’s earliest utterances\r\nwere wholes, answering in value to our sentences. A revolution has been\r\neffected and we have a _part of speech_ for our unit. We construct or\r\nbuild our sentences out of pieces of different meaning and value. Our\r\nsimplest sentence has two of these pieces—a subject or noun, and a verb;\r\na long sentence may have a dozen or a score of pieces. The making of\r\nsentences out of parts of speech is a kind of mechanics. The sentence\r\nhas its mechanism, of which we usually learn the science by analyzing\r\nsentences. This analytical process yields what we call the principles\r\nof syntax. It must be remembered, however, that we learn to talk before\r\nwe learn grammar, and that multitudes of people scarcely know any unit\r\nexcept the sentence. Their vocabulary is a phrase-book, in which every\r\nword has a fixed and unchangeable position. These persons abound in the\r\nilliterate countries; in Italy, for example, the majority of the people\r\nspeak only in sentences having invariable forms; change the order of the\r\nwords and you become unintelligible to them. The same effect is produced\r\nby employing a synonym for any word in any sentence. Our people are\r\nusually more alert to variety in expression and catch meanings in forms\r\nand arrangements to which they are unaccustomed.\r\n\r\nA long sentence falls, when we take it apart, into two large pieces; the\r\nsubject and its belongings, and the predicate and its belongings. Each of\r\nthese large pieces breaks up into a number of small pieces. If we look\r\ncarefully at the average long sentence, we shall find that the parts are\r\nheld together by a systematic and habitual principle of arrangement,\r\nand that this changes in passing from one language to another. French\r\nsays “a man good,” English “a good man.” Reverse the order of noun and\r\nadjective in either language, and the sense is obscured for the average\r\nhearer or reader. There is a number of these differences; and therefore\r\nevery language has its peculiar mechanism. In mechanical type languages\r\nfall into groups. Greek and Latin, for example, use inflections to\r\nconnect the words with each other; English does not employ inflections\r\nfor this purpose. We have a few inflected forms, but we use them merely\r\nbecause they have come down to us. Greek syntax is inflectional; our\r\nsyntax is said to be that of flat construction, or, as I prefer to say,\r\nit is positional. The _place_ of a word determines its function and\r\nrelations in the sentence. This flat construction is found in other\r\ntongues; but English abounds in it and depends upon it as a principle\r\nof arrangement. When we say “proud men,” the hearer knows that the\r\nadjective _proud_ describes the noun _men_. In Latin, the adjective\r\nwould have a termination to correspond in value to that of the noun, and\r\nthe two might be separated by several words. Our principle requires the\r\ntwo to keep close together. If the adjective is to be modified, we may\r\nreverse the order and write “Men proud of their country.” If, however,\r\nthe sentence is simple enough, the adjective may move to the other end\r\nof the statement and become a predicate, as when we say, “Men in that\r\ncountry are proud of their civilization.” These rules show the mechanics\r\nof the adjective. We expect it to precede the noun or to follow it with a\r\ndependent clause, or to follow, at an interval, the verb as a predicate.\r\nYoung writers will be helped in their work by remembering that these are\r\nprinciples of mechanism—that they are building their sentences, and that\r\nthe parts have their proper place and order, just as wood, brick and\r\nstone have in a building.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing illustrations are briefly stated to prepare the way for\r\na few suggestions respecting some special mechanical contrivances of\r\nour language. A general principle in grammar acts as an aggressive and\r\nconquering force; it extends its domain, insensibly and gradually, but\r\nsurely, as far as possible. In an inflectional age a tendency to increase\r\nand perfect inflections is discovered; in a flat-construction age the\r\ntendency to extend the domain of flat syntax is equally manifest. In\r\nour language some constructions are common now, though at one time they\r\nwere scarcely allowed. This general observation is illustrated in the\r\nflat construction of a modifying clause in the nature of a relative\r\npronoun clause. For example, “The man we saw” is a flat construction\r\nwhich has invaded the territory of the relative pronoun. The sentence is\r\ncut down from “the men _whom_ we saw.” Very little study has been given\r\nto these encroachments and conquests; but they will amply reward the\r\ncareful student of them. The flat construction in the province of the\r\nrelative is one of our devices for reducing the use of _who_, _which_,\r\n_whose_, _whom_ and _that_. These words occur so frequently in the speech\r\nand on the printed page that we have quite unconsciously gone about\r\nreducing their importance, and the results are so considerable as to\r\nmerit special attention. I have made some comparative studies, having\r\nfor their object something like accurate measurement of the change in\r\nthe use of this class of pronouns, since the year 1611, the date of the\r\nEnglish Bible of King James. Two great changes are easily discovered.\r\n(1) The number of relative pronouns on a page has been reduced, on an\r\naverage, about one half. (2) The word _that_ has been almost pushed out\r\nof the relative office. The devices by which the use of relatives has\r\nbeen rendered unnecessary, are generally forms of the flat construction.\r\nThe ousting of _that_ from relative functions has been promoted by the\r\nunconscious effort to dispense with the excessive repetition of the\r\nword. When used as a conjunction, a demonstrative and a relative, its\r\nrepetition becomes tiresome to both writer and reader. A careful study\r\nwill show that present English employs _that_ very seldom as a relative,\r\nand much less frequently than the English of the last century employed\r\nit as a connective and a demonstrative. In the case of _that_ we see the\r\noperation of a principle in architectural criticism. If a particular\r\narchitectural device becomes common, it becomes unfashionable. Its\r\nfrequency offends the taste and the offense is punished by a change.\r\nForty years ago the ordinary Greek column was used on small private\r\ndwellings in many sections of this country. It became so disagreeable\r\nto our taste that this column was for some time nearly out of use in\r\npublic buildings. _That_ is, like any piece in architecture, made so\r\ncommon as to become unconsciously offensive. The fact brings out a\r\nsubtle principle of sentence mechanics—we require variety and dislike a\r\ndreary uniformity in this kind of architecture. Good writing in English,\r\n_readable_ English, will always respond in greater or less measure to\r\nthe unconscious demand of the English-reading mind. Most persons do not\r\nknow what is the offending element in a dreary sentence; they only know\r\nthat “the style” is tiresome, and that they can not interest themselves\r\nin the reading. The good writer overcomes the difficulty by avoiding the\r\noffending elements.\r\n\r\nIt will usually be found that the tiresome effect is produced by\r\nrepetition and uniformity. The pieces used may all be good; but we\r\ndo not like to see Greek pillars before every house along the road.\r\nWe tire of Gibbon’s periods, of Addison’s perfection, of Macaulay’s\r\nstateliness. We can read a little of each with delight; for daily diet\r\nwe do not desire any of them. I will now give some of the results of\r\nmy comparative studies of relative pronouns in the English sentence.\r\nI begin with the Bible of 1611. I notice first here that the Psalms\r\ndiffer from other books of the Bible, and I suppose that the difference\r\narises from the superior directness of prayer. The same difference is\r\ndiscoverable between the modern prayer and the sermon. In the Psalms\r\nthere is one relative in each ninety-five words, on the average; and\r\nabout four fifths of these are _thats_. In the _number_ of relatives,\r\nthe Psalms approach closely to modern parsimony; but in the use of\r\n_that_ they exaggerate the practice of the sixteenth century. Many of\r\nthese _thats_ are used in a formula now seldom heard, of which “_he\r\nthat_” is a typical example. In St. Matthew’s record of the Sermon on\r\nthe Mount, there is one relative to each forty-four words; in St. John’s\r\ngospel, chapters one to ten inclusive, there are two hundred and eleven\r\nrelatives, and one hundred and three are _thats_. The proportion of\r\nrelatives is one to each forty-six words. In the first six chapters of\r\nI. Corinthians there are sixty relatives, and of these twenty-seven are\r\n_thats_. The proportion is one relative in forty-five words. Combining\r\nthe results obtained by this counting in the New Testament, the result is\r\none relative for each forty-five words, and more than three sevenths are\r\n_thats_. It is probably safe to assume that in the New Testament sentence\r\nevery forty-fifth word (on the average) is a relative pronoun, and that\r\nthree times in seven this relative is the word _that_. In the Psalms the\r\nrelative occurs not quite half so frequently, but four times in five\r\nthis relative is _that_. We should also remember that at least one form\r\nof sentence architecture of which the relative _that_ is the conspicuous\r\npiece has practically disappeared in modern English. “He _that_ dwelleth\r\nin the secret place of the most high,” is a common syntax of the Psalms.\r\nThere are men who say and write “he who would be rich;” but it is an\r\narchaic formula.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to Shakspere. My counting here has not been as abundant\r\nas I could wish, but I think the results are practically correct for\r\nthe plays. The selections are Richard III., first and second scenes,\r\nand “Love’s Labor Lost,” first and second acts. The proportion is one\r\nrelative to each ninety-three words; and of these relatives _that_\r\nappears a little more frequently than three times in seven. Shakspere\r\nis, therefore, in this use of _that_ almost exactly like the New\r\nTestament; while, like the Psalms, he is modern in his parsimonious use\r\nof relatives. Readers with more leisure than myself may find interesting\r\nemployment in examining Addison and Samuel Johnson. In an idle hour I\r\nfell upon a copy of Burton’s “Anatomy of Melancholy,” and found more\r\nrelatives and a larger proportion of _thats_ than in the New Testament.\r\nIn Samuel Johnson there are probably fewer relatives; his stately\r\nLatinity avoided these mean little hinges of clauses. Since writing the\r\nlast sentences I have examined the first act of Shakspere’s “Hamlet,”\r\nand I find a smaller proportion of relatives than I have found in any\r\nwork except modern poetry. I find but forty-eight relatives in the whole\r\nact, and just half are _thats_. Another thing to note is that this act\r\ncontains a large proportion of flat constructions. A further examination\r\nshows that the Plays differ much in the management of connective\r\napparatus for clauses. The elevated tone and strong emotion of “Hamlet”\r\naccount for infrequent use of the lifeless relative forms.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up any recent author, let me state as a general rule of\r\nproportion that present English uses relatives less frequently than\r\nthe Psalms and Shakspere, and not quite half as frequently as the New\r\nTestament. There is, however, one difference to be noted: English writers\r\nhave carried this reform somewhat farther than Americans have carried\r\nit. It is still further to be noted that preachers and theological\r\nwriters usually have a good deal of biblical syntax, and therefore\r\nemploy relatives more freely than other writers. It is a convenient\r\nplace to mention the fact that in modern English of the best type,\r\nellipsis is more common than in older writers or inferior modern writers.\r\nThe old writers and their readers had more time than we have, and the\r\n“economy of attention” was not in Shakspere’s day a recognized rule of\r\nrhetoric. The inferior modern writer is afraid to trust an ellipsis to\r\nthe tender mercies of the critic, and spoils his sentences by trying\r\nto say everything. Ellipsis is one of the chief places for art and\r\ngenius in writing. As a rule, American writers are in greater awe of the\r\ngrammarians than Englishmen are. We shall find, then, more relatives in\r\nAmerican than in English writers; we shall find more in sermons than in\r\nother writings. Young ministers are often advised to cultivate a biblical\r\nstyle. I must confess my inability to sympathize with efforts to employ\r\nreligion upon the unavailing task of continuing the use of dead words and\r\nforms. If we are to write and speak in dead tongues as a religious duty,\r\nlet us go back to Greek, at least, if not to Hebrew. The truth is that we\r\nought to put the Bible into modern English, and so end the unprofitable\r\nbusiness of disagreeing about the claims of a biblical style upon the\r\npulpit. At present the contention is that in order to imitate the Bible\r\nof 1611, preachers should use obsolete English.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the usage of modern writing in the employment of\r\nrelative pronouns, let us begin with a modern Englishman. I select Mr.\r\nBagehot’s books, because in him we may hope to find the high-water mark\r\nof this reform. Mr. Bagehot was an editor and a banker; he represents\r\nthe directness, force, and brevity of editorial and business writing.\r\nHis “Lombard Street” is a book on the financial arrangements of the\r\nbusiness public of England. It is therefore practical; but it is also\r\nessentially scientific. In this book Mr. Bagehot employs, on the average,\r\none relative pronoun in one hundred and twenty-seven words. This is a\r\nlittle more than one third as many as the New Testament employs. I call\r\nthis high-water mark; two thirds of the relatives have disappeared.\r\nI am not sure of it, but I think Mr. Bagehot did not use _that_ as a\r\nrelative pronoun. I find that about _one fortieth_ of the relatives\r\nin the American edition are _thats_; but it is probable that some of\r\nthem were put in by the American printers—unconsciously, of course—and\r\nit is possible that all have a typographical parentage. In “Money and\r\nthe Mechanism of Exchange,” by Professor Jevons, I can not find a\r\nrelative _that_; there may be a few; but in this case, too, the edition\r\nis American. Accepting, however, the count, let the readers measure\r\nthe change from the Psalms of 1611, in which eighty per cent. of the\r\nrelatives are _thats_, to Walter Bagehot, in whose “Lombard Street” only\r\nabout two per cent. of the relatives are _thats_. The relatives occur a\r\nlittle more frequently in the book of Professor Jevons, just referred\r\nto. By my count there is one relative in one hundred and thirteen words.\r\nI have more carefully counted the relatives in the essays of Mr. James\r\nAnthony Froude, and find one relative in each one hundred and twenty\r\nwords. I have only American editions of these essays, and in these\r\neditions _that_ is employed as a relative in a very few cases. This use\r\nof _that_ is so infrequent and so opposite to Mr. Froude’s ordinary\r\npractice, that we may safely set it down as some one’s blunder—possibly\r\nMr. Froude’s, more probably the American printer’s. If we accept these\r\n_thats_ as Mr. Froude’s, the per cent. of them is so small as to deprive\r\nthem of importance. I thought I had caught Mr. Froude’s secret when I\r\nfound that in his essay on Norway he apparently wrote “trout that” and\r\n“fish that.” Mr. Froude is a mighty fisherman, and it was possible that\r\nhe might glorify the fish by a peculiar form of pronoun. But I turned to\r\nthe essay on “A Day’s Fishing at Cheney’s,” and found “fish which” and\r\n“trout which.” This failure to find even a fanciful explanation leaves\r\nnothing to be said except that “some one has blundered” into the relative\r\n_thats_ of Mr. Froude. These three English writers—Bagehot, Jevons, and\r\nFroude—probably represent very fairly the untheological writers of our\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nFor a test specimen of theological writers, I turn to a volume of sermons\r\nby the Rev. James Martineau. I have counted the relatives in three\r\nsermons, “The Bread of Life,” “The Unknown Paths,” and “The Finite and\r\nthe Infinite in Human Nature.” The relatives occur more frequently than\r\nin the non-theological writers. My count shows an average of one relative\r\nin each ninety-three words. The use of _that_ is abundant. Out of one\r\nhundred and seven relative words, thirty-one are _thats_. These sermons\r\nwere probably composed forty years ago, and represent an archaic type of\r\nsermonic style, a style largely affected by that of the Bible of 1611.\r\nI have noted without counting, that the sermons of Mr. Spurgeon contain\r\na higher proportion of relatives, and that this great preacher employs\r\n_that_ with as much frequency as Mr. Martineau. Turning to American\r\npreachers, I have taken up a recent sermon of Dr. John Hall, of New York,\r\nand I find one relative in each sixty-five words, and of these relatives\r\nmore than one third are _thats_. Dr. Hall used in 1884 more _thats_ than\r\nJames Martineau used forty years earlier. But Dr. Hall is a preacher of\r\na very biblical type, and his choice of relatives is often dictated by\r\npartial quotation of texts. Passing over to non-theological writers of\r\nour time and country, let us take the general result of countings in\r\nessays and books. The average number of relatives is about ten per cent.\r\ngreater than in contemporary English writers, and _that_ is relatively\r\nemployed about one fifth of the time. The importance of the reduction of\r\nthe use of relatives can not be properly appreciated without remembering\r\ntwo or three conditions of their use. One fact is that there is seldom\r\nany discernible rule which is followed in the choice of _that_ in place\r\nof _which_. The example given from Mr. Froude’s practice—whether it is\r\nhis or his printer’s—illustrates the absence of any guidance by a rule.\r\n\r\n_That_ has no longer any standing place in the relative ranks; it merely\r\nrelieves _which_ of a part of its work; and in English writers even\r\nthis supernumerary function has practically ceased to be filled by it.\r\nA second condition of the use of relatives is much more important. It\r\nhas always been possible to build the best of English sentences without\r\nrelatives. A peculiarly animated sentence of any age will usually contain\r\nno relatives. In Dr. John Hall’s sermon, the longest sentences and the\r\nanimated passages contain no relatives. When he drops into a relative,\r\nwe see that the exaltation of feeling is passing off, and the sermon\r\nis sinking to a lower level of interest. It is apparently a law, then,\r\nthat relatives are more rarely found in animated, elevated and perfectly\r\nclear English than in weaker and less emotional writing. A third fact\r\nis that I find the relatives of a sermon, book, or essay, occurring in\r\ngroups. Often there are whole pages with none; then come three, four,\r\nfive or more in about as many lines. This grouping is almost as true of\r\nthe Bible as of modern English. In Dr. Hall’s sermon, fifty-six occur in\r\nthe first and least animated half of it, and only thirty-eight in the\r\nsecond half of it, and one fifth of all the relatives of the discourse\r\noccur in groups; take twenty-four printed lines out of the sermon, and\r\nthere will be left only about as many as Professor Jevons employs. The\r\neffect of these groups deserves, I have thought, careful study; but the\r\nresults require more space than is now at command. A single example\r\nfrom Mr. Froude will suffice to indicate the general conclusion. Within\r\nthirty-six lines—taken in groups of from two to fourteen lines—Mr. Froude\r\nuses twenty-five relatives—or one relative in each fourteen words, while\r\nhis general average is—as above stated—one in each one hundred and twenty\r\nwords. How shall we describe such a use of relatives? Plainly they are\r\nnot necessary. The only explanation I can think of is that it is a\r\ncareless habit. The relatived passages are the poorest and weakest, in\r\nall the modern English I have examined. The groups of relatives are to me\r\nvery significant; they show that relative pronouns are unnecessary; the\r\nineffectiveness of the English where they occur shows that the relative\r\nis obsolescent.\r\n\r\nTo compress this study into a small space I have omitted a number of\r\nimportant facts. I pass to the conclusions (_a_) I have reached. (1)\r\nThe relative pronoun (_b_) being essentially an inflectional device, is\r\nopposed by the tendencies (_c_) prevailing in English syntax—tendencies\r\nto flat construction. If the reader will look at (_a_), (_b_) and\r\n(_c_) in the preceding sentences, he will see specimens of the flat\r\nconstruction. (2) _That_ is dead as a relative pronoun. Its use is a\r\nmere carelessness. (3) In some of the so-called idioms for the relative\r\n_that_, the word is not a relative at all, and the “idiom” itself is a\r\ncase of flat construction. In “All _that we_ know,” the relative usually\r\nfollowing the demonstrative _that_ has been omitted. (4) The so-called\r\ncompound relative _what_ is not a relative at all; in _our_ modern use it\r\nis another flat construction to reduce the employment of _which_ and its\r\nantecedent demonstrative. (5) I infer that the flat constructions ought\r\nto be classified and studied in schools. The effect of such teaching and\r\nstudy will be seen in a more vigorous English, and it will not be long\r\nbefore we shall begin to say, “THE RELATIVE PRONOUN MUST GO.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME STUDIES IN CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. J. T. EDWARDS, D.D.\r\n\r\nDirector of the Chautauqua School of Experimental Science.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY OF ORGANISMS.\r\n\r\nAn organism is a structure endowed with life, and acting by means of\r\norgans. Organic beings are of two kinds, vegetable and animal. Ordinarily\r\nthere is little difficulty in discriminating between them, but there\r\nis a border line along which the two great kingdoms meet, which is as\r\nshadowy and uncertain as that uniting, in distant view, the ocean and the\r\nsky. It is usual to say that animals move their parts, and that plants\r\ndo not. The former have locomotion, the latter are stationary. Animals\r\nhave nerves and receive their food in cavities; plants do not. But the\r\nmost important distinction of all is that the vegetable world draws its\r\nsupport from the mineral world, while the animal lives upon the vegetable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOWING THE FAT GLOBULES IN MILK.]\r\n\r\nBoth animals and plants begin their existence with a single cell. Growth\r\nconsists in the enlargement and multiplication of cells. Here the\r\nphysiologist terminates his investigations, and the chemist begins.\r\n\r\nHis first step, however, results in the destruction of the organism. Of\r\nhim it is emphatically true, “He murders to dissect.” The moment that\r\nchemistry seeks to determine the elementary character of an organic\r\nsubstance, that substance ceases to have an organic form. In a sense,\r\ntherefore, there is no such thing as _organic_ chemistry. It is a\r\nconvenient term, however, for the study of the chemistry of substances\r\nformed by life.\r\n\r\nUntil recently it has been supposed that the chemist could destroy\r\norganic substances, but that he could not create them. This idea is no\r\nlonger held. A great number of the compounds formed by plants and animals\r\nhave been produced in the chemist’s laboratory, without the aid of vital\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nWhile it is undoubtedly true that many of the compounds found in plants\r\nand animals are not _necessarily_ related to organisms, there are usually\r\nsome plain facts which differentiate organic compounds from inorganic.\r\nAmong these may be named the following: Organic substances are usually\r\ncomposed of but few elements; oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon\r\nconstituting almost all their material. Ten other elements are very\r\nsparingly distributed in them.\r\n\r\n_Sixty-six_ elements enter into the formation of inorganic matter.\r\n\r\nThe _atomic_ structure of the former is very complex; that of the\r\nlatter is simple. For example: A molecule of the white of egg contains\r\n222 atoms, while a molecule of salt has but two. Again, the compounds\r\nof organic existences are innumerable. Inorganic compounds are\r\n_comparatively_ few. The former are unstable, on account of the presence\r\nof nitrogen, while the latter are fixed and quite permanent. The former\r\nare also distinguished for the many examples of isomerism they furnish.\r\nIsomeric compounds are those formed of the same elements in the same\r\nproportions. Thus, camphene, the oils of bergamot, juniper, birch, black\r\npepper, lemon, cloves, turpentine, ginger, cubebs, orange, and many\r\nothers are isomeric, each one being composed of ten atoms of carbon and\r\nsixteen of hydrogen. The difference in these volatile oils is supposed to\r\nbe due to a variation of the _arrangement_ of the atoms composing them.\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly consider the\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThis is obtained from the air and earth. The former supplies carbonic\r\nacid, and water in the form of vapor, through the stomata of the leaves;\r\nthese are little mouths or breathing pores, chiefly situated on the\r\nunder side of the leaf. They vary in number from one thousand to one\r\nhundred and seventy thousand to the square inch. An apple-tree leaf of\r\naverage size has one hundred thousand pores. The old elm at Cambridge,\r\nunder which Washington stood while reviewing the Continental army, has\r\nbeen estimated to produce a crop of seven million leaves, thus exposing\r\na surface of five acres, and therefore furnishing billions of stomata.\r\nIf the amount of carbonic acid gas in the air were much increased, all\r\nhigher forms of animal life would perish. If it were materially lessened,\r\nvegetation would soon wither and die, involving the death of all animals,\r\nfrom lack of food. Plants derive the element carbon from this gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLANT STARTING IN LIFE.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Chevandier, an acre of beech forest annually absorbs three\r\nand one half tons of carbonic acid gas, and from this eliminates about\r\none ton of carbon.\r\n\r\nMost of the oxygen and hydrogen of plants is probably obtained from\r\nthe water absorbed by leaves and roots. Recent experiments indicate\r\nthat plants may sometimes absorb oxygen directly from the air. This is\r\nespecially true in the case of buds, as may be shown by the following\r\nexperiment:\r\n\r\nCut twigs of willow, oak or apple just before the buds are to unfold, and\r\nplace the ends in a little holder containing a small amount of water, and\r\nset this in a saucer; partially fill the saucer with quicksilver; over\r\nthe twigs invert a glass fruit jar filled with oxygen, so that its mouth\r\nwill be sealed by the quicksilver. The buds will unfold, and some of the\r\noxygen disappear, but if the jar be filled with hydrogen or nitrogen the\r\nbuds will decay. De Saussure,[1] by a somewhat similar experiment, proved\r\nthat oxygen is absorbed by the roots of plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF AN EXOGENOUS STEM.]\r\n\r\nBoth gases and moisture are taken up and distributed through the cells\r\nby osmose.[2] This may easily be shown; cut off the end of a carrot and\r\nscoop out the central portion of the remainder, and place in the cavity\r\ndry sugar; this will soon be converted into a syrup, and the sides of the\r\ncarrot will have perceptibly shrunk, from the passage of moisture out of\r\nthe cells to the sugar.\r\n\r\nThe mineral constituents of plants are all taken up by the roots in the\r\nform of solution, water being the great carrier by which plants are\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nThe following substances are invariably present in all agricultural\r\nplants, and in many others, viz.: Potash, soda, lime, magnesia, oxide\r\nof iron, chlorine, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, silicic acid, and\r\ncarbonic acid. The chemical composition of different specimens of the\r\nsame plant is found to be quite uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE NUTRITION.\r\n\r\nYoung plants first feed upon the store of nourishment placed in the seed,\r\neither in cotyledons,[3] or around them. Soon the little roots acquire\r\nthe power to take their nourishment from the earth in which they are\r\nimbedded. They absorb moisture and the materials in solution, which rise\r\nthrough the latest formed wood as ascending sap, and in the cells of the\r\ngrowing parts, especially the leaves, undergo the transformations which\r\nconvert inorganic into organic substances. Hales[4] calculated that the\r\nforce which impels the sap in a grapevine in summer time is five times as\r\ngreat as that which drives the blood through the arteries of a horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF AN ENDOGENOUS STEM.]\r\n\r\nMuch of the water is evaporated. A large sunflower was found to exhale\r\ntwenty or thirty ounces during the day, but very little at night. After\r\nthe sap has been elaborated in the cells, under the influence of air\r\nand light, it descends just under the bark, in the cambium layer, and\r\nfurnishes the material for the growth of cells and young buds, and\r\nnourishes all growing parts of the plant. This process takes place\r\nessentially in the earlier part of the season. In late summer and autumn\r\nthe circulation in the leaves is impeded by the deposition of mineral\r\nmatter, so that the plant or tree becomes gorged with the fluids which\r\nare ready to flow again at the coming of spring. It is this supply which\r\nis drawn upon in the “sugar bush.” A bucketful is often obtained from a\r\nsingle maple tree in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe cambium layer, or mucilaginous material between the bark and wood,\r\nhardens into cellular tissue and forms an annular growth. This is the\r\ncase in all exogenous plants. If a section be made of one of them its age\r\nmay be easily determined by counting the rings. The other great class\r\nof plants called endogenous, has the growing masses distributed through\r\nthe stem. The common cornstalk is an illustration. Few things are more\r\nsurprising than the way in which different plants manufacture from the\r\nsame elements their\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThis is noticeable in grafting. I have seen a thorn bush having one\r\nlimb loaded with Bartlett pears. Now the material which ascended the\r\nstem was distributed to all the branches, but the cells in some of\r\nthem manufactured it into thorn apples, while in this branch it was\r\ntransformed into delicious fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOWING A CYCAS, A YUCCA, TWO COCOANUT PALM TREES, AN\r\nINDIAN CORN STEM, AND A BANANA.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt plants have the powers to select various materials. Upon the\r\nsame acre of land a hundred different plants may feed and manufacture as\r\nmany varieties of products, sweet, bitter, sour, poisonous, nutritious,\r\nfragrant, offensive, green, yellow, red, and so on through the entire\r\nlist. As has already been suggested, many vegetable products which are\r\nquite diverse in character, are either identical or quite similar in\r\nchemical composition. Starch, whether obtained from the potato, the\r\nroot of the carrot, the kernel of corn, the leaves of the cabbage, or\r\nthe cotyledons of the bean, is composed of six atoms of carbon, ten\r\natoms of hydrogen, and five atoms of oxygen. Sago, tapioca, bread fruit,\r\narrowroot, and scores of other plant products have the same proportions.\r\nWoody fiber whether from the root, stem or branch, woven into cloth,\r\nbuilt into houses, twisted into rope, made into paper, used as fuel, or\r\nmanufactured into furniture, is C₆H₁₀O₅.\r\n\r\nSlight variations in composition often produce marked differences. The\r\nintroduction of the least ferment into sugar (C₆H₁₂O₆) would break it up\r\ninto two deadly poisons, alcohol (2C₂H₆O) and carbonic acid gas (2CO₂—two\r\nmolecules of each). A slight addition of oxygen spoils all the sweetness\r\nof the preserves.\r\n\r\nThe rhubarb manufactures oxalic acid, the grape tartaric acid, the apple\r\nmalic acid, the lemon citric acid, the oak tannic acid, from carbon,\r\nhydrogen and oxygen, by simply varying the number of their atoms.\r\n\r\nIf we add one atom of oxygen (C₁₀H₁₆O) to the constituents of the\r\nvolatile oils previously mentioned, we form a new group comprising\r\ncamphor, wintergreen, spearmint, cinnamon, bitter almonds, and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great uniformity in the composition of various\r\nvegetable products, it is now well understood that one crop may restore\r\nto land what another has removed, hence the modern agricultural doctrine\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\nROTATION OF CROPS.\r\n\r\nIn southeastern Virginia you find many pine forests in which may be\r\ntraced the ridges of the corn rows. These fields were planted with corn\r\ncontinuously, until the soil became so impoverished that it would not\r\nyield a crop. They were then abandoned and allowed to grow up to pines.\r\n\r\nA better system would have secured perpetual fertility. The soil of\r\nEngland produces far more than formerly, even after the cultivation of\r\na thousand years. China furnishes a still more remarkable example of\r\nproductiveness.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the earth’s crust which is concerned in the support of life\r\nis exceeding small. The natural tendency is constantly to diminish this.\r\n\r\nRains and rivers bear away the best of the soil and deposit it in the\r\nlakes and seas. Some inhabitant of our earth in the far future, may\r\nsecure the benefit of these stores, when the beds of the present seas and\r\noceans shall have risen above the waters and become the continent.\r\n\r\nToo much pressed by the demands of the present to even think of this, the\r\nwise farmer endeavors to return to his soil what it has lost.\r\n\r\nGrowing crops are plowed under, fertilizers from the thronging cities\r\nare spread upon his fields, the seaweed cast up by the waves yields\r\nits potash, phosphorus, salt and iodine. The islands of the Pacific\r\ncontribute their vast stores of ammonia accumulated for ages in guano\r\nbeds; marl deposited in the estuaries of ancient geologic seas feeds\r\nthe cereals; and the limestone deposits are made to give verdure to\r\nthe grasses of a thousand meadows. In the meantime, nature has her\r\nown processes of restoration. The crumbling of the rocks by frost,\r\ntheir abrasion by water, the accumulation of humus by decay, and\r\nvarious chemical influences conspire to convert the unproductive rocks\r\ninto fertile soil. It would seem that this intelligent forethought,\r\nunited with the beneficent processes of nature may secure perpetual\r\nproductiveness, to the end that the earth may continue to yield its\r\nincrease for the sustenance of the animal, for, as the Scriptures say,\r\n\r\n\r\nALL FLESH IS GRASS.\r\n\r\nDirectly or indirectly all animals live on plants. We have roast lamb\r\nfor dinner to-day, but yesterday the lamb was browsing herbage. It is an\r\ninteresting fact that the nutritive qualities of bread are almost the\r\nsame as those of beef—each, in itself, is very nearly a perfect food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAN MEAT.]\r\n\r\nGreat principles of economy regulate the use of these two articles, in\r\naccordance with the scarcity and price of either. Man may live without\r\nbread if he have meat, and vice versa, but his system demands one of\r\nthem, or its equivalent.\r\n\r\nAs in the cell of the plant, mineral substances become organized, so,\r\nunder the influence of animal vitality does vegetable material become\r\ntransformed into the constituents of a new organism. The great argument\r\nagainst the doctrine that alcohol is a food, lies in the fact that it\r\ndoes not undergo this transformation. It leaves the body as it enters it.\r\nBut beef-steak ceases to be steak, and bread is no longer the same; they\r\nhave become bone, tissue, nerve, and all that makes a human body\r\n\r\nMost are familiar with the marvelous processes of mastication, digestion,\r\nabsorption and aeration, by which food is converted into blood freighted\r\nwith all that is essential to the nutrition of the human system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COLUMN, ARCHES, DOMES, SPIRES AND MINARETS.]\r\n\r\nFoods serve three great purposes—growth, restoration of waste,\r\nand supply for heat. Whether vegetable or animal, they are of two\r\nclasses—nitrogenous and carbonaceous. The former consists of all seeds\r\nand vegetable tissues, and flesh in animal foods. The latter comprises\r\nthe starch and sugar of vegetables, and fat in animals. Nature seems\r\nto suggest the propriety of using both as food for man. His teeth are\r\nadapted to the mastication of both, and the varied demands of different\r\nseasons and climates furnish a not less conclusive argument in its favor.\r\n\r\nIt is not our design to discuss here the dietetics or even the chemistry\r\nof food. There is, however, one branch of the subject that calls for\r\na passing remark—the value of foods for special purposes. As the\r\nagriculturist is now carefully considering the adaptation of soils to the\r\nvarious kinds of vegetation, and is also inquiring into the character of\r\nthose fertilizers that will continue and increase the growth-producing\r\nqualities of his land, so the physiologist is seeking to discover the\r\nspecial value of different aliments for all conditions of health and\r\ndisease. The problem is necessarily somewhat difficult, but the end is so\r\ndesirable—nothing less than human safety, comfort and development—that\r\nit is one of the most worthy of all the questions of science. Wholesome\r\nfood, cheap food, and appropriate food for all classes and conditions is\r\nits aim. What does the weary brain require? What will give strength to\r\nmuscle? How may the impoverished blood be enriched? How can vigorous,\r\nsymmetrical growth be secured to childhood and youth? These are vital\r\nquestions. Even when applied to the wants of the lower animals they are\r\nof immense importance. What conditions are most favorable for fattening\r\ncattle? What will give greatest strength and best sustain continuous\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nNote a simple instance of one result of such inquiry. In ascertaining the\r\nfood value of cottonseed, the revenue of our cotton crop is said to have\r\nbeen doubled. In medical practice physicians are more and more inclined\r\nto depend upon their knowledge of the principles of alimentation and\r\nthe adjustment of proper nourishment to the sick than upon artificial\r\nstimulants or medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCLE COMPLETED.\r\n\r\nWe conclude this article on the chemistry of organisms, with the somewhat\r\nhumbling reflection that to all living beings there comes a time when\r\nvitality yields to the power of those chemical forces, which resolve them\r\nagain to their original inorganic forms. It can not be that this was the\r\nonly and ultimate end contemplated by the Creator, in that sublime system\r\nof arrangement for life, which began with the morning of creation and\r\nended with man. Nature is more than a cycle of change from dead matter to\r\nvegetable form, thence to animal life, and thence back again to mineral\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nSolomon wrote: “The dust shall return to the earth as it was, and the\r\nspirit shall return unto God who gave it;” and another has said: “There\r\nremains the paramount duty of rendering worthy of survival that spiritual\r\npart of our being which no merely physical power can destroy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICS OF ORGANISMS.\r\n\r\nA brief discussion of some _physical_ characteristics of organisms will\r\nconclude our articles on “Home Studies in Chemistry and Physics.”\r\n\r\nThe abundance of metaphorical expressions even in common language,\r\nindicates the numerous resemblances between the living and inorganic\r\nworlds. Description and poetry are full of imagery. A metaphor implies\r\na resemblance between objects, a simile suggests it, and a comparison\r\nstates it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DIONÆA, OR VENUS’S FLY-TRAP.]\r\n\r\nThus to the human mind, the different departments of nature seem to\r\nreflect a light and beauty upon each other, even as the “earth-shine”\r\nlights the moon in the absence of the sun. The sky is a dome; the groves\r\nare temples; the sea moans and roars; the falling cataracts laugh and\r\nshout, and the calm lake is the smile of the Great Spirit. “Language,”\r\nsays Dean Trench,[5] “is fossil poetry.” “Architecture is frozen music.”\r\n\r\nMany of the forms of art and devices of human invention have been\r\nsuggested by Nature. The Doric column was borrowed from some stately tree\r\nshaft. The ornamented capital of the Corinthian column was decorated by\r\ncarved copies of the graceful acanthus leaves. Gothic architecture found\r\nits models in the tree tops of the arching forests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HUMAN HEART, SHOWING CHAMBERS AND VALVES.]\r\n\r\nEvery experimenter in science is simply one who is inquiring of Nature\r\nfor her analogies, truths, forms, forces, and machines; and like the wise\r\nand good mother that she is, she has granted many a pregnant suggestion\r\nto the busy brains of discoverers and inventors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEPENTHES,[6] A PITCHER PLANT OF THE INDIAN\r\nARCHIPELAGO.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nPlants in their action illustrate many of the principles of natural\r\nphilosophy, as if directed by intelligence. Turn their roots upward\r\nin the soil, and they will invariably turn down to the moisture. Bend\r\ntheir stems to the earth and they will seek to mount upward. The young\r\nsunflower greets the sun at his rising, and turns to behold his setting.\r\nUnwind a twining vine, and wind it in an opposite direction, and it will\r\nsoon assert its right to assume its own method. Some plants shrink from\r\ntouch; others, like the Venus fly-trap,[7] hold out their open palms to\r\ncatch flies; many sleep; most seem to select special places, seasons,\r\nand conditions. They seem almost, at times, to be possessed of moral\r\nqualities. They adapt themselves to situations. If the season is dry,\r\nthey are sparing of moisture; if the soil is scanty, they penetrate\r\ndeeper for sustenance; if the winds are fierce, they grow strong by\r\nstruggle; if gashed or broken, they have “philters for healing;” if\r\npruned and chastened, they yield richer fruitage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF A FROG.—A GOOD SET OF SPRINGS.]\r\n\r\nOne can not help feeling that certain trees have a personality. They are\r\nfriendly with their shade. They are proud in their loftiness, confident\r\nin their strength, satisfied in their usefulness.\r\n\r\nOther plants are almost equally interesting. Flowers have long been\r\nchosen to express the language of sentiment. Even the lowest forms of\r\nvegetable life, like the algæ, the mosses and lichens, arrange their\r\nparts with symmetry and beauty. Even the microscopic diatoms[8] are\r\nexquisite in the perfection of their curves and markings.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL MECHANISM.\r\n\r\nComparative anatomy long since showed us that there is great harmony in\r\nthe construction of animals. A few principles seem to govern in all.\r\nFor example: None violate the law of gravity with regard to the line of\r\ndirection’s falling within the base. They employ the lever, the inclined\r\nplane, the pulley, and the mechanical means of applying power, precisely\r\nas we do in machinery. The heart is a pump; the stomach is a churn; the\r\nbackbone has springs; the elbow is a hinge; the muscles are ropes; the\r\nnerves are telegraph wires; the ear is a harp, the eye is a telescope.\r\nThe most perfect mechanism characterizes the construction of all the\r\nanimal kingdom, but one can do little more than suggest the interest of\r\nthis most fascinating subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOWING PRINCIPLE OF VENTURI.\r\n\r\n_Ex._—S V is the sub-clavian vein; J is the jugular vein; D is the\r\nthoracic duct, through which the chyle is poured into the blood.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRADES AMONG ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nAn ancient saying declares that “Poets are born, not made,” and classic\r\nstory informs us that Minerva sprang full armed from the head of Jove.\r\nSomething like this natural perfection appears in the occupations of\r\nthe lower orders of creation. Man is a creature of education, absolutely\r\nunlimited in point of time in the possibilities of his development.\r\nOther animals, within their own limited scope often attain an excellence\r\nsuperior to his. Note the scent of the greyhound, the hearing of the cat,\r\nthe sight of the eagle. As artisans they have few apprentices, though\r\nit must be confessed that some are better workmen than others, and they\r\nare not without “bosses.” Observe a few of their trades. The brant-goose\r\nis a navigator, which may have already found the pole. The heron is a\r\nfisherman, who carries his torch upon his breast. Swallows are excellent\r\nmasons; so are wasps and the caddis fly.\r\n\r\nThere is a spider that is a diver; he makes his own bell and fills it\r\nwith air. The bee is a geometrician that never studied Euclid. The\r\nant is a political economist, who, like Joseph, lays up supplies for\r\na time of want. There is a “tailor bird.” There are hosts of hunters\r\namong the carnivora. The nautilus is a “little sailor,” and weavers are\r\ninnumerable. Beavers unite the trades of lumbermen and civil engineers.\r\nThere are carpenters and paper makers, indeed, time would fail in the\r\nattempt to mention all the occupations pursued in this busy world of\r\nanimate creation. Yet over all these the Almighty has given man dominion.\r\nThey are but organisms impelled to their appointed tasks by unreasoning\r\ninstinct, but, as Sir William Hamilton has said: “_Man_ is not an\r\norganism, but an _intelligence_ served by organs.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BIRD’S HEAD.\r\n\r\n_Ex._—The mandibles form a pair of scissors.

H. VINCENT, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_June 7._]\r\n\r\nCourtesy is, strictly speaking, a Christian grace.… It is the offspring\r\nof charity; and since it derives its being from divine grace; since it is\r\nmade the subject of divine command; since it is especially calculated to\r\nsmooth those little asperities which sometimes hinder even “the living\r\nstones of the temple” from being so perfectly joined and so fitly framed\r\ntogether as they should be; since it powerfully tends, likewise, to\r\nremove the prejudices and to allay the enmity so generally entertained\r\nby the world toward the church; above all, since, in combination with\r\nother causes it may contribute to win souls to God, we surely ought not\r\nto deem it unsuitable, but to make it … the subject of our particular\r\nand attentive consideration.… While some professed disciples of Christ\r\nseem to have substituted in the place of genuine courtesy a conformity\r\nto the manners and habits of ungodly men, which very ill consists with\r\nthat simplicity of character which should distinguish the remnant of true\r\nIsraelites, there are others who, through an honest disgust toward the\r\nimpertinent fopperies of the world, and an ill-directed fear of becoming\r\ninfected with the same spirit of guile and hypocrisies, have even run so\r\nfar into the opposite extreme of churlishness as to be culpably negligent\r\nof the mere forms of civilized society.\r\n\r\nThe courtesy of the world is an imposing form.… But the courtesy of\r\na Christian is not a mere form. It is not the phantasm of a feeling\r\nwhich has no real existence. It is the outward expression of an inward\r\ndisposition, the conduct which a benevolent mind will on all occasions\r\ninstinctively prescribe. It is the natural and unconstrained operation\r\nof unfeigned love. Let us but love our neighbor as ourselves, and it\r\nwill be morally impossible to violate the laws of courtesy; for love\r\nworketh no ill to his neighbor. It will teach us cautiously to avoid\r\nwhatever might unnecessarily wound his feelings; it will dispose us\r\nassiduously to study his inclination, ease, and convenience; it will\r\nmake us anxious to interpret his very looks, that we may even anticipate\r\nhis requests; it will enable us cheerfully to make a sacrifice of our\r\nown gratifications with a view to his. All this is perfectly easy; it is\r\neven delightful where love exists without dissimulation; but let this\r\nheavenly principle be wanting, take away from the _form_ of courtesy the\r\n_power_, and it becomes an arduous and irksome task, a yoke grievous to\r\nbe borne.—_Summerfield._[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_June 14._]\r\n\r\nI would not slight this wondrous world. I love its day and night. Its\r\nflowers and its fruits are dear to me. I would not willfully lose sight\r\nof a departing cloud. Every year opens new beauty in a star; or in a\r\npurple gentian fringed with loveliness. The laws, too, of matter seem\r\nmore wonderful the more I study them in the whirling eddies of the dust,\r\nin the curious shells of former life buried by thousands in a grain\r\nof chalk, or in the shining diagrams of light above my head. Even the\r\nugly becomes beautiful when truly seen. I see the jewel in the bunchy\r\ntoad. The more I live, the more I love this lovely world; feel more its\r\nAuthor in each little thing; in all that is great. But yet I feel my\r\nimmortality the more. In childhood the consciousness of immortal life\r\nbuds forth feeble, though full of promise. In the man it unfolds its\r\nfragrant petals, his most celestial flower, to mature its seed throughout\r\neternity. The prospect of that everlasting life, the perfect justice yet\r\nto come, the infinite progress before us, cheer and comfort the heart.\r\nSad and dissatisfied, full of self-reproach, we shall not be so forever.\r\nThe light of heaven breaks upon the night of trial, sorrow, sin; the\r\nsomber clouds which overhung the east, grown purple now, tell us the\r\ndawn of heaven is coming in. Our faces, gleamed on by that, smile in\r\nthe new-born glow; we are beguiled of our sadness before we are aware.\r\nThe certainty of this provokes us to patience, it forbids us to be\r\nthoughtfully sorrowful. It calls us to be up and doing.…\r\n\r\nThere is small merit in being willing to die; it seems almost sinful in\r\na good man to wish it when the world needs him here so much. It is weak\r\nand unmanly to be always looking and sighing voluptuously for that. But\r\nit is of great value here and now to anticipate time and live to-day the\r\neternal life. That we may all do. The joys of heaven will begin as soon\r\nas we attain the character of heaven and do its duties. That may begin\r\nto-day. It is everlasting life to know God, to have His Spirit dwelling\r\nin you, yourself at one with Him. Try that and prove its worth. Justice,\r\nusefulness, wisdom, religion, love, are the best things we hope for in\r\nheaven. Try them on—they will fit you here not less becomingly. They\r\nare the best things of earth. Think no outlay of goodness and piety too\r\ngreat. You will find your reward begin here. As much goodness and piety,\r\nso much heaven. Men will not pay you—God will; pay you now, hereafter,\r\nand forever.—_Theodore Parker._\r\n\r\n\r\n[_June 21._]\r\n\r\nLet us do all the business we can.… If we can’t be a lighthouse, let\r\nus be a tallow candle. Some one said, “I can’t be anything more than a\r\nfarthing rushlight.” Well, if you can’t be more, be that; that is well\r\nenough. Be all you can. What makes the Dead Sea dead? Because it is\r\nall the time receiving, never giving out anything. You go every Sunday\r\nand hear good sermons, and think that is enough. You are all the time\r\nreceiving these grand truths, but never give them out. When you hear it,\r\ngo and scatter the sacred truth abroad. Instead of having one minister\r\nto preach to a thousand people, this thousand ought to take a sermon\r\nand spread it till it reaches those that never go to church or chapel.\r\nInstead of having a few, we ought to have thousands using the precious\r\ntalents that God has given them.…\r\n\r\nIf God has not given us but half a talent, let us make good use of that.\r\nWhen God told the people to take their seats by fifties, he told Philip\r\nto get food for them. “What,” says Philip, “feed them with this little\r\nloaf? Why, there is not more than enough for the first man.” “Yes, go\r\nand feed them with that.” Philip thought that was a very small amount\r\nfor such a multitude of hungry men. He broke off a piece for the first\r\nman, and didn’t miss it; a piece for the second man, and didn’t miss it;\r\na piece for the third man, and didn’t miss it. He was making good use of\r\nthe loaf, and God kept increasing it. That is what the Lord wants to do\r\nwith us. He will give us just as many talents as we can take care of.\r\n\r\nThere are many of us that are willing to do great things for the\r\nLord; but few of us willing to do little things. The mighty sermon on\r\nregeneration was preached to one man. There are many who are willing\r\nto preach to thousands, but are not willing to take their seat beside\r\none soul, and lead that soul to the blessed Jesus. We must get down to\r\npersonal effort—this bringing one by one to the Son of God. We can find\r\nno better example of this than in the life of Christ himself. Look at\r\nthat wonderful sermon that he preached to that lone woman at the well of\r\nSamaria. He was tired and weary, but he had time and the heart to preach\r\nto her. This is but one of many instances in the life of the Master from\r\nwhich we may learn a precious lesson. If the Son of God had time to\r\npreach to one soul, can not every one of us go and do the same?…\r\n\r\n“I commend you”—and in this connection, I want to tell you how the God of\r\nall grace has kept us. For nearly twenty-one years he has watched over\r\nme. He has watched over me and stood by me in the hour of temptation and\r\ntrial; he has brought light to me out of darkness; and he will do the\r\nsame with you. In leaving you, young converts, I would like to leave\r\nwith you two Ws—the one is Work, and the other is the Word; or, rather,\r\nthe first is the Word, and the other is Work. Go out and work for him,\r\nand you will become strong Christians. There are two lives that you\r\nwant to lead. The one is your inner life, that the world knows nothing\r\nof, that the wife of your bosom knows nothing of. That life is between\r\nyourself and God; and if you don’t lead this aright, the outer life will\r\nnot be long right. Let me say to you, young converts, read your Bibles\r\nand you will be strong. If you don’t, you will fall; and the men who\r\nare now scoffing at this movement will say: “I told you you would fall\r\nback again; the meetings have been only an emotional excitement; only a\r\nsensation.” I pray that God Almighty may keep you. Just have those two Ws\r\nbefore you—the Word and Work—and make that your banner.—_D. L. Moody._\r\n\r\n\r\n[_June 28._]\r\n\r\nWhat language, “Father, forgive them!” and, in the words, what an act,\r\ngreater than the most splendid miracles with which he marked his radiant\r\npath through the world.…\r\n\r\n“Forgive them!” Is it possible? With these words … he covers the guilty\r\nheads of his murderers with the shield of his love, in order to secure\r\nthem from the storm of the well deserved wrath of Almighty God. With\r\nthese words, which must have produced adoring astonishment, even in\r\nthe angels themselves, he takes these miscreants in the arms of his\r\ncompassion, and bears them up to the steps of his Father’s throne, in\r\norder to commend them to his mercy. For know, my readers, that the words\r\n“Forgive them,” mean, in Jesus’s mouth, not merely, “Do not impute to\r\nthem the murderous crime they have committed upon me.” No, when he utters\r\n“Forgive,” it comprehends something much more, and embraces the whole\r\nregister of sins. In his mouth it means, “Plunge their whole sinful life\r\ninto the depths of the sea, and remember no more their transgressions,\r\nbut consider these sinners henceforth as dear in thy sight, and act\r\ntoward them as such.”\r\n\r\nThere are individuals on earth for whom no one feels inclined to pray,\r\nbecause they are too depraved. There are those who even dare not pray\r\nfor themselves, because their consciences testify that such worthless\r\ncreatures as they are can not reckon upon being heard. What a prospect\r\nis here opened to people of this description! Ah, if no heart beats for\r\nthem on earth, the heart of the King of kings may still feel for them.\r\nIf among their friends not one is to be found to intercede for them,\r\nyet, possibly, the Lord of Glory is not ashamed of bearing their names\r\nbefore his Father’s throne. O, what hope beams on Calvary for a sinful\r\nworld! And if the great Intercessor appears there for a transgressor,\r\nhow does his intercession succeed? Though a whole world should protest\r\nagainst it, his prayer saves whom he will. His voice penetrates the\r\nheart of the eternal Father with irresistible power. His entreaties are\r\ncommands. Mountains of sin vanish before his intercession. How highly\r\ncharacteristic and deeply significant is the fact that the Lord, with\r\nthis prayer, commences the seven expressions he uttered on the cross. The\r\nwords, “Forgive them!” show us not merely the heaven of loving kindness\r\nwhich he carries in his bosom, but it also darts like lightning through\r\nthe gloom of the entire night of suffering, and deciphers the mysterious\r\nposition which the Holy One of Israel here occupies as Surety, Mediator,\r\nand High Priest.…\r\n\r\n… And yet the prayer for forgiveness raises its wing from the mount\r\nof suffering and passes apparently through all those eternal and\r\nunimpingeable statutes and limitations. It puts aside even Mount Sinai\r\nand Ebal, and heeds not the cherub of the law, who keeps the gate of\r\nparadise, and is enjoined to admit only the righteous. Careless of his\r\nflaming sword, it soars with seemingly unheard-of boldness above the\r\nbrazen walls of the manifold menaces of the divine maledictions which\r\ninexorably close against sinners the entrance to the mansions above, and\r\nin a most striking contrariety with the indelible inscription over the\r\neternal sanctuary, “Him that sinneth against me will I blot out of my\r\nbook,” requests forgiveness and even admittance into the habitations of\r\nthe blessed children of God, for rebels, blasphemers, and murderers.—_F.\r\nW. Krumacher._[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEART BUSY WITH THINGS ABOUT US.\r\n\r\nBY JOSEPHINE POLLARD.\r\n\r\nThe eye may be trained so that it can detect the least flaw in a diamond;\r\nthe ear be so delicately attuned that the slightest variation in the\r\nharmony will be perceptible, although there is no apparent attempt at\r\nlistening, and discord will have the same effect on the sensitive nerves,\r\nas a blow on a fine strung instrument. The engineer can not see all the\r\nworking parts of his engine, so he is obliged to cultivate his ear until\r\neach throb, plunge, and revolution is familiar to him, and the whole set\r\nto a rhythmic movement, any change in which betokens disaster.\r\n\r\nAn eye quick to see, and an ear quick to hear may belong to a wide-awake,\r\nsuccessful business man; but in order to become a philanthropist, a wise,\r\nenergetic, live Christian, he must have a heart to feel. A father may see\r\nthat his children are poorly clad, may hear their cries of distress, but\r\nif he has no heart to feel their needs, he will go off and leave them to\r\nthe care of charity, as so many fathers, and mothers too, have been known\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nThis inclination to avoid cares, to shirk responsibilities, and to live\r\na purely selfish life, is the result of a defect in the cardiac region,\r\nwhich might have been corrected in early youth.\r\n\r\nThe training of the heart begins at so early an age that it can not be\r\nknown with certainty just when the child is first acted upon by the\r\ninfluences around it, and it is more easily misdirected than guided\r\naright.\r\n\r\nAn accomplished lady, of considerable literary fame, spent a great deal\r\nof time in preparing a lecture on “Individual Sovereignty,” which was\r\nto prove that children had rights that parents and guardians ought to\r\nrespect. The lecture was delivered but once, to a very small number of\r\npeople who, while full of admiration and respect for the lecturer, were\r\nnot in favor of putting her theories into practice, believing that a\r\nmonarchy such as she proposed would make the Land of Liberty a place that\r\ngrown people would want to get away from.\r\n\r\nThe great bond of brotherhood is sympathy. “Pity and need make all flesh\r\nkin,” and “sympathy is especially a Christian’s duty.” But there is an\r\nactive sympathy and there is a passive sympathy; the one sits down and\r\nbroods over the calamities of life, wrings its hands, sheds tears, and\r\nsighs over its own incapacity; while the other is up and doing all it can\r\nto relieve the necessities of those perhaps less heavily burdened than\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n“It is not all of life to _live_,” nor all of life to _love_ either;\r\nfor some in their excessive fondness will allow those whom they might\r\ncontrol, to walk in evil ways and indulge in unlawful passions without\r\nputting forth a restraining hand.\r\n\r\n“I want John to have a good time,” says the indulgent mother. “I don’t\r\nwant Jennie to tire herself, or to soil her hands doing housework. What\r\nelse am I good for?” So John grows to be a selfish, disagreeable man,\r\nand Jennie an ease-loving, self-satisfied woman, both with hearts\r\nincapable of feeling any interest in anything that does not immediately\r\naffect their physical comfort and well-being. Mothers, do not spoil your\r\nchildren and destroy the foundations of character. Let them wait upon you\r\nand do your errands; teach them to cultivate a self-sacrificing spirit,\r\nto feel that it is no hardship to give up their own personal comfort in\r\norder to secure the happiness of others. The sacrifices should not be all\r\non one side; and yet we have known mothers to give up their lives rather\r\nthan disappoint the children, who must have their wishes gratified at any\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nExacting children should be made to wait upon themselves, and to practice\r\npatience and self-denial; for the tyrannical spirit is fostered by unwise\r\ntimidity and forbearance, and many a passionate man and woman lives\r\nto regret the lack of proper discipline in youth. But it lies within\r\nourselves to correct mistakes that may have been made in our training;\r\nand it has been truthfully said, “Every person has two educations, one\r\nwhich he receives from others, and one, more important, which he gives to\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how much may be accomplished by one who is energetic\r\nand persevering, careful to avail himself of all opportunities, and to\r\nuse all the spare time at his disposal. Ancient and modern histories and\r\nbiographies are full of illustrations showing the benefits conferred upon\r\nmankind by certain individuals whose hearts were busy with the things\r\nabout them. It is interesting to read this record of General Gordon—or\r\n“Chinese Gordon,” as he is familiarly called—whose valiant deeds have won\r\nhim undying fame:\r\n\r\nFrom 1865 to 1875 Gordon lived at Gravesend, employed in the duty of\r\nimproving the defenses of the Thames. These were his six years of quiet\r\npeace and beneficent happiness. “He lived wholly for others,” writes\r\nhis friend. “His house was school and hospital and almshouse, in turn;\r\nwas more like the abode of a missionary than of a commanding officer of\r\nengineers. The troubles of all interested him alike. The poor, the sick,\r\nthe unfortunate, were ever welcome, and never did suppliant knock vainly\r\nat his door. He always took great delight in children, but especially in\r\nboys employed on the river or the sea. Many he rescued from the gutter,\r\ncleansed them and clothed them, and kept them for weeks in his house.\r\nFor their benefit he established reading-classes, over which he himself\r\npresided, reading to and teaching the lads with as much ardor as if he\r\nwere leading them to victory. He called them his ‘kings,’ and for many of\r\nthem he got berths on board ships. One day a friend asked him why there\r\nwere so many pins stuck into the map of the world over his mantlepiece;\r\nhe was told that they marked and followed the course of the boys on their\r\nvoyages; that they were moved from point to point as his youngsters\r\nadvanced, and that he prayed for them as they went, night and day. The\r\nlight in which he was held by those lads was shown by inscriptions in\r\nchalk on the fences. A favorite legend was ‘God bless the Kernel!’ So\r\nfull did his classes at length become that the house would no longer\r\nhold them, and they had to be given up. Then it was that he attended and\r\ntaught at the Ragged Schools, and it was a pleasant thing to watch the\r\nattention with which his wild scholars listened to his words.”\r\n\r\nThe workhouse and the infirmary, writes another, were his constant\r\nhaunts, and of pensioners he had a countless number. Many of the dying\r\nsent for him in preference to the clergyman, and he was ever ready to\r\nvisit them. His purse was always empty because of his free-handedness,\r\nand he even sent some of his medals to the melting-pot in the cause of\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nWhen another appointment removed him from Gravesend, there was universal\r\nregret. The local newspaper paid him the following graceful and sincere\r\ntribute: “By general and continual beneficence to the poor, he has been\r\nso unwearied in well-doing that his departure will be felt by numbers\r\nto be a personal calamity. His charity was essentially charity, and had\r\nits root in deep philanthropic feeling and goodness of heart; shunning\r\nthe light of publicity, but coming even as the rain in the night-time,\r\nthat in the morning is noted not, but only the flowers bloom and give\r\na greater fragrance. All will wish him well in his new sphere, and we\r\nhave less hesitation in penning these lines from the fact that laudatory\r\nnotice will confer but little pleasure upon him who gave with the heart\r\nand cared not for commendation.”\r\n\r\nMilitary glory pales before this display of missionary zeal.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve any success the heart must be in the work, and from\r\nthis center of our being all true Christian culture must begin. Every one\r\ncan make his own destiny, and\r\n\r\n    “Taught by time the heart has learned to glow\r\n     For others good, and melt at other’s woe.”\r\n\r\nIt is good to indulge the habit of looking out of ourselves, to study the\r\nways and needs of others, and to keep the heart busy with things about\r\nus—the trifles, as they are considered, which are apt to be overlooked or\r\nmade light of. For there is great danger that the small philanthropies\r\nand courtesies of life will be neglected because of the large schemes\r\nthat are so absorbing. This kind of outlook requires, of course, a\r\ncertain amount of _insight_, or intuition, without which we can not bring\r\nourselves into sympathetic relations, or prove ourselves the friend of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nOur home, the place where we spend the most of our time, should be the\r\nfield in which to exercise our best gifts, wherein we both sow and reap,\r\nand which is left to us to brighten and beautify, or to darken and\r\ndisgrace. The heart renewed by grace is zealous of good works, fond of\r\nhome, and anxious to do its full duty therein. It has a word of cheer for\r\nthose who are cast down; it comforts the sick; speaks tenderly to those\r\nin trouble; has patience with the erring; seeks out ways of interesting\r\nthe young; is mindful of the aged, and helpful to everybody.\r\n\r\n    “A heart at leisure from itself,\r\n     To soothe and sympathize,”\r\n\r\nneed never want for an opportunity; and it is often the small attentions,\r\nthe unconsidered trifles, that are most highly valued.\r\n\r\nThe heart that begins its labors in too wide a sphere will find it hard\r\nto concentrate its interests, while a more gradual expansion will result\r\nin more satisfactory work, and the strengthening of the magnetic current,\r\nfor on our personal magnetism depends, to a great extent, our influence\r\non those with whom we associate. What responsibilities rest upon fathers\r\nand mothers, on sisters and brothers! How much good and how much evil\r\nthey can do in their special fields of operation! That son needs a little\r\nwholesome correction from the father, a few kind words may be all that\r\nis requisite, but the father is busy about other affairs, his heart is\r\ninterested in things outside of his family, and the boy slips downward\r\nfor want of a restraining hand. That girl would have turned out, oh! so\r\ndifferently, if she had only had the right kind of a mother. Some boys\r\nand girls are not fit to be left to themselves. They seem to be born\r\nwithout any inward monitor, or strong moral sense. The germ may be there,\r\nbut it has never been properly cultivated.\r\n\r\nAt a school examination the question was put, “What is conscience?” But\r\none pupil could give the definition, “An inward monitor.”\r\n\r\n“What is your idea of an inward monitor?” asked the inspector, and away\r\ndown at the lower end of the room a hand was stretched forth, and a voice\r\nproclaimed, “It’s an iron-clad, sir!” So it is. Fortified to resist evil,\r\nbut to assist good; and a “tender conscience,” to keep up the nautical\r\nfigure, is the small convoy that supplies the soul with spiritual\r\nsustenance.\r\n\r\nA conscience alive to duty will serve as an electrical alarm to notify\r\nus what is to be done and when and how we are to do it. If you have sick\r\nneighbors, and can not conveniently call upon them yourself, send to\r\ninquire how they are and in what way you can be of service. An offering\r\nof fruit or flowers will often be most acceptable to invalids or their\r\nfamilies, who are cheered and sustained by the thought that other hearts\r\nare sympathizing with them. Keep down your own sensitiveness, and learn\r\nto make generous allowance for other people. Show that your zeal is not\r\nof the offensive sort, that your politeness is deep and genuine, that\r\n“out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,” and you will\r\nalways be on good terms with your neighbors, and with yourself.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of ways of helping people, and no two people may be\r\nhelped in precisely the same way. The most deserving are the most modest,\r\nand it may take considerable study and observation for you to discover\r\nthat Mrs. Needlewise, whose children always look so neat and well\r\ndressed, would be thankful for the cast-off clothes which are taking up\r\nthe room in your garret, or which you give away recklessly just for the\r\nsake of getting rid of them. Mrs. Needlewise would be offended at your\r\noffering her the garments, but friendliness, and the exercise of a little\r\ntact, will remove the barriers and enable you to relieve anxieties that\r\nwere a continual burden.\r\n\r\nA dear, good woman whose heart was always open to the necessities of\r\nthose about her, was in her old age given to somewhat erratic impulses.\r\nOne morning, much to the mortification of her family, she seized the\r\ncoffee-pot and went into a near neighbor’s, a poor but proud little\r\nwoman, who would go without rather than beg. The old lady, in her sweet\r\nway, said to the farmer’s wife that it was a pity to waste so much good\r\ncoffee, and she had brought it over for her to use. The gift was accepted\r\nwith a smile, and to please the old lady the coffee was used by the good\r\nman of the house, who sent word that he had never tasted any quite so\r\ndelicious, and should be glad to be so favored again. It was the entering\r\nwedge of neighborly kindness, and the beginning of better days for the\r\npoor family whose fortunes at that period were at a low ebb. The right\r\nkind of a lift at the right time will put human nature on its feet, and\r\nreëstablish the foundations that were in danger of giving way.\r\n\r\nO, the magnetizing power of love! beginning first with the love of\r\nChrist, and then reaching out toward all our fellow-creatures! How\r\nwide spreading, how far-reaching in its influences! Home missions,\r\nforeign missions, small charities or large ones, incidental acts of\r\nkindness, thoughtful consideration for the welfare of others, all that\r\na self-sacrificing spirit can do is done cheerfully and without hope of\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nA saintly young woman whose earthly pilgrimage ended at thirty-four, is\r\nthus eulogized by the pastor of the church for which she labored lovingly\r\nand assiduously: “She gave out so much to others that she has left\r\nherself broken in fragments here and there, and you and I hold this or\r\nthat fragment so really that we are only hardly persuaded to acknowledge\r\nthat there is an end of her earthly life for a time. How simply, purely\r\nand patiently that life was lived, you know.… Many and many a time have\r\nI pointed to that life as an example of what people might do and might\r\nbe, if they would do as she did—be content ‘to live faithfully a hidden\r\nlife,’” Her mother says: “Her unselfish work and devotion were marvelous.\r\nIt is often said of her that she crowded more into her short life than is\r\ndone or experienced in the longest. She shone the brightest in her daily\r\nlife at home, always serving some one, forgetful of self. Her pure spirit\r\ngrew so fast that the frail body could not retain it; yet she faded so\r\nslowly, so cheerfully and hopefully, that we hardly believed she could\r\nnot rally until the day before she left us. Our sunshine is gone, but the\r\nradiance is still left in the memory of her sweet life.”\r\n\r\nBlessed memory!\r\n\r\nIn this bright way she speaks of herself when laid aside from her sphere\r\nof usefulness, and obliged to some extent to discontinue the literary\r\nwork which had proved so acceptable to the public and already given\r\nher considerable fame as an author: “I’ve been occupied with turning a\r\ncorner, round which the landscape is different, and getting used to the\r\nchange. I suppose it has been coming on for a good while; at all events,\r\nafter some ten years of ruddy health and active exercise, I am not to\r\nsweep any more for a while, not to walk, not to sing, read aloud, talk\r\nmuch, not to hurry, not to get tired at anything.… Of course it is a\r\nlittle queer and painful sometimes, because, particularly, my father is\r\nalways an invalid, and increasingly so. One dreads to be another anxiety.\r\nBut I have no real reason to fret. Something good will come of it, I will\r\nexpect. I am so thankful that I need not give up writing that I will not\r\nmind the rest of my denials;” and then when her own health was declining,\r\nand the sunset hour of her life was nearer than she thought, she closes\r\nher letter with “Good night, dear. Health and God’s blessing!” and it was\r\na final “good night,” for word soon came of her entering into communion\r\nwith the saints above.\r\n\r\nThe more heart we put into our work, whether it be domestic drudgery,\r\nthe care of the sick, or “whatsoever the hand findeth to do,” the more\r\nperfect and satisfactory it will be; and according to the measure with\r\nwhich we serve others, is meted out to us the happiness we derive from\r\nthat service. The sending of a letter full of kindly thought and sympathy\r\nhas often brought a return far beyond the expectation of the sender. A\r\nlittle gift, a token of good will, insignificant in itself, has spoken\r\nvolumes to the recipient, and brightened a day that was full of clouds.\r\nTo do no more than our duty does not fill the measure of Christian\r\nusefulness. We would grieve if compelled to walk a narrow path, fenced\r\nin on either side, and not allowed to look to the right or left, or to\r\npluck the fruits that lined the road; and God and his holy angels must\r\ngrieve when we neglect to turn out of our path to assist others, and make\r\nexcuses for the non-performance of heart service.\r\n\r\nA young lady, very much interested in mission work, and an active worker\r\nin a large school connected with a flourishing church, felt offended\r\nat some of the officers of the school, and decided to send in her\r\nresignation. Each Sunday she had been accustomed to place before the\r\nchildren some text that they might carry with them through the week,\r\nabsorbing its teachings and principles so that they would be “wrought out\r\nin living characters.”\r\n\r\nAll through the week her mind dwelt upon the injustice that she felt had\r\nbeen done her, and she went to the mission school the following Sunday\r\nfully determined to give up the work which had been her delight for so\r\nmany years. As she entered the room her gaze rested on the text which\r\nstood out in bold lettering, as she had printed it the previous Sunday:\r\n\r\n    “Even Jesus pleased not himself.”\r\n\r\nThe arrow struck home. It would never do to have that text uppermost when\r\nshe handed in her resignation, so she reversed the roll, and there in as\r\nbold type appeared:\r\n\r\n    “Jesus, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.”\r\n\r\nThere was no use trying to avoid the situation, or to escape the\r\nresponsibilities. The teacher’s work was there. She knew it; she felt it.\r\n\r\n    “To doubt would be disloyalty;\r\n     To falter would be sin;”\r\n\r\nso she roused herself to greater endurance, put more heart into work, and\r\nhad the satisfaction of hearing it said that never since her connection\r\nwith the school had she given such a splendid lesson. The approval of her\r\nown conscience was not the least of her compensations, and there is no\r\nfurther talk of her giving up her position in the mission school.\r\n\r\nWe may be so situated that we can not do any great work in the world.\r\nBy temperament, by education, or by reason of ill-health we may be\r\nrestricted from carrying out our ambitious schemes, but there are none\r\nso weak, so ignorant, or so poor that they can not do some good in the\r\nworld. The ladder that reaches to heaven is not composed of wooden rungs,\r\nor of cold, senseless material, but God has made every human being so\r\ndependent on his fellow-creatures that each one is lifted up by some one\r\nabove him, some busy heart that feels another’s need and reaches out;\r\nand when there is no looking up nor reaching out there is no growth nor\r\nspiritual attainment.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know people you must get near them; first go down to\r\ntheir level, and then bring them up to yours, not waiting for any great\r\noccasion, or a more direct revelation, but taking advantage of small\r\nopportunities, and making your influence felt in quiet, unobtrusive ways.\r\n\r\n“And when it is all over, and our feet will run no more, and our hands\r\nare helpless, and we have scarcely strength to murmur a last prayer, then\r\nwe shall see that instead of needing a larger field we have left untilled\r\nmany corners of our single acre, and that none of it is fit for the\r\nMaster’s eye were it not for the softening shadow of the cross.”\r\n\r\n  “It was only a cup of water, with a gentle grace bestowed,\r\n   But it cheered a lonely traveler upon the dusty road;\r\n   For the way was long and dreary, and the resting places few,\r\n   And the sun had dried the streamlets and drank up the sparkling dew;\r\n   None noticed the cup of water as a beautiful act of love,\r\n   Save the angels keeping the record, away in that land above;\r\n   But the record shall never perish, and the trifling deed shall live,\r\n   For heaven demands but little from those who have least to give!\r\n\r\n  “It was only a kind word spoken to a weeping little child,\r\n   But the thread of its grief was broken, and the little one sweetly\r\n     smiled;\r\n   And nobody stayed to notice so tiny an act of love,\r\n   Save the angels keeping the record in the wonderful book above.\r\n   And she who had spoken kindly went on her quiet way,\r\n   Nor dreamt such a simple action should count at the last great day.\r\n   But the pitying words of comfort were heard with a song of joy,\r\n   And the listening angels blessed her from their beautiful home on high.\r\n\r\n  “It isn’t the world-praised wonders that are best in our Father’s sight,\r\n   Nor the wreaths of fading laurels that garnish fame’s dizzy height;\r\n   But the pitying love and kindness, the work of the warm caress,\r\n   The beautiful hope and patience and self-forgetfulness;\r\n   The trifle in secret given, the prayer in the quiet night,\r\n   And the little unnoticed nothings, are good in our Father’s sight.”\r\n\r\nThere is always some one to smile at, somebody to give your chair to,\r\nsomebody to whom a book, a flower, or even an old paper, will be a boon.\r\nThese small attentions will open the way to confidence, will make it\r\npossible that in need these friends will give you opportunities to help\r\nthem which, unless you had shown thoughtfulness and regard for them, they\r\ncould never have done. A quiet, sympathetic look or smile many a time\r\nunbars a heart that needs help which you can give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEASY LESSONS IN ANIMAL BIOLOGY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUB-KINGDOM IX.—VERTEBRATA.\r\n\r\nThough reptiles are generally regarded with aversion, there is much of\r\ninterest in their natural history, and even they may serve some useful\r\npurpose. There are four genera, and about fifteen hundred species.\r\nThe respiratory organs are the same in all, and are such as belong\r\nto air-breathing animals. With few exceptions they are carnivorous;\r\ngenerally sluggish in their habits, and their sensations dull. Nearly all\r\nthe winter they are in a state of lethargy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING TOAD.]\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIA.—There are several species of cold blooded amphibious\r\nvertebrates which are properly neither fishes nor reptiles, but, having\r\nsome things in common with both, should be mentioned here. Their\r\nrespiration is most peculiar, as they have only gills when young, and,\r\nwhen adult, lungs. In their immature state they are fish-like, but\r\ndevelop no fins; and their limbs, when they at length have them, show\r\nthe same articulations as those of higher animals. These amphibia,\r\nin the progress of their development undergo a series of remarkable\r\nmetamorphoses. They begin life as water-breathing larvæ. In some of the\r\nlower orders the gills remain through life; others, when mature, have\r\nlungs only. Aquatic Newts, two-legged Mud-Eels, Toads, and Salamanders,\r\nare their representatives. The _Batrachia_[1] include the frog, a well\r\nknown, tailless amphibian. Its metamorphose is peculiar. The ova are\r\ndeposited in a jelly-like mass at the bottom of the water, and, if the\r\ntemperature is suitable, develop rapidly. In a few days very interesting\r\nmicroscopic observations are possible. The embryo presents four distinct\r\nappearances before leaving the egg, and five more before assuming its\r\ncomplete organization. For a time it seems a soft-skinned, scaleless\r\nfish, breathing only as fishes do, and having a long, flexible tail,\r\nused as an oar. Then it develops the palmated hind legs, as assistants\r\nin its locomotion, the caudal process diminishes, the forelegs protrude,\r\ntrue lungs are developed, the wriggling tadpole is a frog; abjures\r\nkinship with its still aquatic relatives, hops to the land, and enters on\r\npursuits befitting its new mode of life. The common frog is well known,\r\nand we present one of a different family. It is distinguished by having\r\nthe ends of its toes dilated into discs, or suckers, by which it sticks\r\nto the smooth bark, and is capable of its arboreal life. It is often\r\ncalled the “flying frog” and the “tree frog.” The webbed feet are large,\r\nand when spread out serve to bear up the body, as would paper kites of\r\nthe same size. But the animal does not fly. It is active, and leaps from\r\nbranch to branch expertly, and, when it wants to descend, by spreading\r\nthose fan-like feet, it comes down with less violence. Tree toads are\r\nnoisy little creatures, and seem to be ventriloquists, as their voices do\r\nnot indicate their true position. This deception, and their color, make\r\ntheir capture more difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II.—REPTILIA.\r\n\r\nORDER I.—_Ophidia_,[2] or serpents, are oviparous, air-breathing\r\nvertebrates, having round, tapering bodies. They crawl or glide on their\r\nventral surface. The serpent’s body is very flexible. Its numerous\r\nvertebræ, concave in front, and hemispherically convex behind, are so\r\njointed as to allow a free horizontal motion. Its progress is usually\r\nby lateral undulations, made practicable by the great number of the\r\nvertebræ, attached flexible ribs, and muscles along the sides, specially\r\narranged for prompt action on the spinal column. The bones of the head\r\nare loosely jointed, and movable, making the mouth very dilatable. The\r\nsharp teeth are hooked backward, so that whatever is seized is likely to\r\ngo down the capacious throat. The entire skeleton and skin are so elastic\r\nthat objects much larger than the serpent, in its normal condition, can\r\nbe swallowed whole. Though without limbs, they perform with dexterity a\r\ngreat variety of movements; creep, climb, swim, raise the body almost\r\nerect, and spring from the ground. There are two classes, the poisonous\r\nand the harmless. Of the former the Cobra, Copperhead, Viper, and\r\nRattlesnake are representatives. They have extensile fangs, and, along\r\nthe side of the upper jaw, a large gland, which secrets a poisonous\r\nliquid that is injected through the hollow or grooved fangs into the\r\nwounds they inflict. Harmless snakes have much the same structure, but\r\nnothing of this special arrangement.\r\n\r\nORDER II.—_Lacertilia_[3] or lizards, are snakes with short legs, and\r\nusually much quicker in their movements than most other reptiles. Most\r\nspecies are harmless, though a few are said to be venomous, and, because\r\nof them, all are dreaded. They differ much in appearance, some being\r\nreally beautiful, and others about as hideous as reptiles can be. There\r\nare an immense number and variety of lizards, having some distinctive\r\ncharacteristics. Several extinct species, as the Iguanadon,[4]\r\nMegalosaurus,[5] Plesiosaurus,[6] and Ichthyosaurus,[7] are known only by\r\ntheir gigantic fossils, casts of which may be seen in many of our college\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\nORDER III.—_Chelonia._[8] This name is derived from the Greek word for\r\ntortoise. The class includes all the varieties of tortoises or turtles.\r\nTortoise means crooked, or twisted, and refers to the awkward manner\r\nin which the limbs are twisted about when in motion. There are two\r\nskeletons, the one external, including the viscera and the whole muscular\r\nsystem, which is internally attached to it. The upper plate of this\r\ncovering, called the carapace, is more or less convex, and made up of\r\nstrong elastic plates. The lower, or plastron, is flat and smooth, being\r\napparently an extension of the sternum or breast bone. These plates are\r\njoined together at their lateral edges, leaving anterior and posterior\r\nopenings through which the head and limbs are extended. When at rest,\r\nthese are usually under the covering. The head and neck are covered with\r\na rough, corrugated skin, and the horny upper jaw terminates in a strong,\r\nhooked beak. They are usually distinguished as marine, fresh water,\r\nand land turtles. The former are good swimmers, but their movements on\r\nland are slow and awkward, and if turned on their backs they are quite\r\nhelpless. Some marine turtles are very large, being from four to six feet\r\nin diameter, and weighing from 600 to 2,000 pounds. Usually they weigh\r\nmuch less. All are oviparous, the female producing about one hundred and\r\nfifty hard-shelled eggs at a time. For this purpose she cautiously comes\r\nashore, and, dextrously using her hind flippers, excavates a hole in the\r\nsand, from a foot to eighteen inches in depth, lays her eggs, and, having\r\ncarefully covered, leaves them to be hatched by the heat of the sun. The\r\ngreen, edible turtle is very valuable, and furnishes much wholesome and\r\ndelicious food. The “hawks-bill” is seldom used for food, but supplies\r\nthe greater part of the well known “tortoise shell” of commerce. There\r\nare many other species, both marine and fresh-water, whose flesh or\r\nshells are of considerable value. Soft Tortoises, Snappers, Mud-Turtles,\r\nand Terrapins, all have some peculiar characteristic.\r\n\r\nORDER IV.—_Loricata._[9] This corselet or armor-covered family includes\r\nCrocodiles and their allied species. Their upper parts are covered with\r\na corselet of bony plates set in the tough, leathery skin. The jaws are\r\nlong, and have many strong, conical teeth, fixed in sockets. The lower\r\njaw extends back of the cranium, and the upper is hinged and movable.\r\nCrocodiles belong in tropical climates, are sluggish animals, and live\r\na long time if not destroyed by violence. Their legs are short but\r\npowerful, and when on land they manage to wriggle, or drag, their immense\r\nbodies along with considerable speed. They are found in India, and in\r\nall the large rivers of Africa. The Gavial of the Ganges, the Crocodile,\r\nand the Mississippi Alligator are closely related, though there are some\r\nstructural differences. Of whatever variety, whether of the Old World or\r\nof the New, they are more numerous than desirable, not being noted for\r\neither their beauty or usefulness.\r\n\r\nCLASS III.—_Aves._[10] Birds furnish a delightful study, and their\r\nleading characteristics are easily stated. Widely as they differ, they\r\nall have a common type of structure, and are essentially alike in those\r\nparticulars that distinguish them from other orders in the animal\r\nkingdom. They are all warm blooded, feathered, biped vertebrates, mostly\r\nwith wings fitted for flight, and with either webbed feet for swimming,\r\nor claws for seizing, scratching, and perching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANATOMY OF A HEN.\r\n\r\n_Ex._—A, cranium; B, cervical vertebræ; G, furcula, or merry thought; J,\r\nsternum, or breast bone; H, cloaca, surrounded by the pelvic bones; E,\r\ncaudal vertebræ, terminating in plowshare bone; D, lumbar vertebræ, or\r\nrump; C, F, dorsal vertebræ, to which the ribs are attached.]\r\n\r\nThere are several points of interest in the anatomy of a bird that may\r\nbe used to bring out general characteristics: (1) The long neck, with\r\nvertebræ so adjusted as to allow great freedom of movement, makes the\r\nhead a convenient prehensile organ. (2) The skeleton is remarkably light.\r\nIt has fewer bones than other vertebrates; the thin skull bones, the\r\ndorsal vertebræ, and bones of the feet being anchylosed.[11] They are\r\nalso harder, of lighter material, and filled with air, thus having the\r\ngreatest possible strength with the least weight. (3) To make respiration\r\nsufficient during rapid flight, an abundant supply of air not only\r\ninflates the lungs as in other animals, but fills little membranous sacs,\r\nor cells, distributed through the body, and extends even into the wing\r\nfeathers. (4) The digestive apparatus differs materially from that of\r\neither fishes, reptiles, or mammals. The æsophagus[12] before reaching\r\nthe sternum is dilated into a large sack, or crop, and serves as a first\r\nstomach, in which the food is softened, and prepared for other digestive\r\norgans. Below this is another slight enlargement, the walls of which are\r\nthicker, and secrete gastric juice. Still further down, the canal is\r\nenlarged into a third stomach, the muscular gizzard, in which the process\r\nis completed. (5) There are no teeth set in the bone sockets, as their\r\nweight would be inconvenient, but the mandibles are sheathed in a horny\r\ncase, which has sharp edges, and terminates in the beak, or bill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NESTS OF BIRDS.]\r\n\r\nBoth genera and species are very numerous, but any two birds that can\r\nbe selected differ less in their anatomy than some reptiles of the same\r\norder differ. The leading orders only of this class have been selected.\r\n_Raptores_[13] (robbers). This is a mild term when used to indicate\r\nthe ferocity of most birds of prey which not only plunder but destroy.\r\nThey are almost constantly committing murderous assaults on their\r\nweaker neighbors. This is their nature, and accords with their physical\r\nstructure. The strong hooked bill, powerful legs, feet armed with sharp\r\nclaws to seize and hold their victims, while the murderous beak is\r\ntearing off bits of flesh, are some of their chief characteristics.\r\nThese murderers have representatives in nearly all countries, but as\r\ncivilization advances they become less numerous.\r\n\r\nThey are usually divided into three great families: Falcons, Vultures,\r\nand Owls. The first includes all kinds of Hawks and Eagles. True falcons\r\nreveal a predatory character, not only by their general structure as\r\ndescribed, but have a special arrangement for keeping their formidable\r\nweapons in order. The continual sharpness of their claws is necessary,\r\nand to maintain it they must be kept from coming in contact with hard\r\nsubstances. To make this practicable, though they are not retractile,\r\nlike a cat’s claws, there not being sufficient integuments to cover them,\r\nthe bird has power to elevate their points when stepping or perching\r\non anything likely to dull them. Being very powerful and rapid flyers,\r\nfalcons were in former times tamed, and trained for catching other birds\r\nand small game. Falconry, in the middle ages, was one of the principal\r\ndiversions of kings and noblemen, lords and ladies, and in later times\r\nthe same sport was practiced in England under the name of “hawking.”\r\nThe training of the birds was a profession, and there were teachers\r\nwho became proficient in it. The Eagle, king of birds, belongs to this\r\nclass; he is, perhaps, inferior in activity and enterprise, but is more\r\npowerful, and his supremacy is undisputed. The Bald Eagle adorns our\r\nAmerican flag, and is a fit emblem of national sovereignty, though there\r\nwas, it is confessed, some ground for Franklin’s protest, “The bird has a\r\nbad moral character, and does not get his living honestly.” The Gypætos,\r\nor Vulture Eagle, is the largest bird of Europe, and often a terror to\r\nthe peasants near the Pyrenees and Swiss Alps. Its great strength, bold,\r\npredatory habits, and impetuosity in pouncing on animals exceeding itself\r\nin size, make it more formidable than most eagles are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLAMINGO.]\r\n\r\nVultures are cowardly, disgusting creatures, and feed mostly on putrid\r\nflesh, yet they are useful scavengers in hot climates, devouring much\r\nanimal matter that would otherwise cause pestilence and death.\r\n\r\nOwls are nocturnal birds of prey, and though seldom abroad except in the\r\ndarkness, or twilight, being often captured and confined, they are pretty\r\nwell known.\r\n\r\n_Insessores_[14] (perching birds). This term is adopted as vaguely\r\ndescriptive of many species, of which no particular mention can be made.\r\nThey include our common singing birds and skillful nest builders. Some of\r\nthese build low, among the grass, others on branches of trees. Some are\r\nsolitary, and during the nesting season isolate themselves. Others, as\r\nthe “sociable weavers,” unite in building them cities, in which each pair\r\nclaims a private residence.\r\n\r\n_Cursores_[15] (runners). Birds of this class run rather than fly, have\r\nno keel on the breast bone, no well developed wings, and their feathers\r\nare loosely put together, without the connecting barbs that strengthen\r\nthe wing feathers of others. But they have strong legs, and feet with\r\nnails rather than claws. The Ostrich is most distinguished for its size,\r\nstrength, speed, and peculiar feathers. The Emeu and Apteryx belong to\r\nthe same class, the latter being tailless.\r\n\r\n_Grallatores_[16] (waders). These aquatic birds are distinguished by\r\ntheir very long, bare legs, also necks and bills of like proportions.\r\nHerons, Storks, and Flamingoes are representatives.\r\n\r\nThe latter is a peculiar bird, common in some portions of America,\r\nSouthern Europe, Asia, and Africa. When walking erect it is about five\r\nfeet high, the body of a light color, and the wings red. When a number go\r\nin single file, as such birds do, they appear like a company of British\r\nsoldiers in uniform. As their legs are quite too long for convenience\r\nwhen incubating, they construct, of grass, rushes, and mud, a little cone\r\nof sufficient height, make their nest on the top, and sit astride, the\r\nlong legs hanging down the sides. This also protects the eggs and young\r\nfrom moisture in wet weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ALBATROSS.]\r\n\r\n_Natatores_[17] (swimmers). Aquatic birds being keel breasted, with short\r\nlegs, webbed feet, and thin, light, warm covering, delight in swimming.\r\nSome of these have also good flying qualities, as Wild Geese, Swans,\r\nSea-Gulls, and Petrels, which spend much time in skimming over the water,\r\neither on or above the surface.\r\n\r\nThis family includes the wandering Albatross, which is among the largest\r\nof the sea birds, having from ten to fifteen feet expanse of the wings,\r\nand weighing from twenty to thirty pounds; yet it sustains itself in the\r\nair for many hours together without any apparent difficulty. It is often\r\nmet far out at sea, and sailors have many superstitions respecting it.\r\nLike all petrels and sea-gulls, the albatross makes its nest on crags and\r\ncliffs along the coast, choosing places that seem inaccessible. To gather\r\nthe eggs of seafowls, which are esteemed a delicacy, and to capture\r\nthe birds themselves for the feathers, is one of the most perilous\r\nemployments. The adventurous fowlers are swung over precipices from five\r\nhundred to a thousand feet above the sea, sustained simply by a rope,\r\nthat, by breaking, or slipping from the hands that hold it, must hurl\r\nthem to certain destruction.\r\n\r\nCLASS IV.—_Mammalia_ (milk givers). Though there are some very low\r\nspecies in this order, it reaches upward and includes the highest forms\r\nof animal organization, all of what ever degree, that have the mammary\r\nglands, and secrete milk for the nourishment of their young. There are\r\nmore than two thousand species of these in North America alone. They have\r\nseveral distinguishing characteristics. The heart is four chambered,\r\nhaving two auricles and two ventricles. They are warm blooded, the\r\nblood having two kinds of corpuscles, the red predominating, and being\r\nglobular. The impure blood from the body pours into the right auricle,\r\npasses to the right ventricle, and thence to the lungs. In the lungs,\r\nwhich are spongy and full of air cells, it is supplied with oxygen from\r\nthe air freely circulating through them. Being thus changed to purer\r\narterial blood, it passes back through the left auricle to the left\r\nventricle, and, by a muscular action, is forced through the great aorta\r\nand its innumerable branches to every part of the body. Mammals always\r\nbreathe by lungs enclosed in a membranous sack called the pleura. They\r\nare viviparous, or produce their young alive, though some when in a very\r\nimmature, helpless state. They are for convenience subdivided:\r\n\r\nORDER I. _Monotremata._[18] These animals, the lowest of mammals, have\r\nlong, flattened beaks, webbed feet, and other bird-like characteristics.\r\nBut they are of little importance, few in number, and not widely\r\ndistributed, being confined mostly to Australia and Tasmania.\r\n\r\nBelonging to this class is the Water-Mole, with a broad, duck-like,\r\nhorny bill. It lives on worms and vegetables, and burrows in the banks\r\nof streams, having the opening to its quarters under the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nORDER II. _Marsupial_, or pouched animals. The young are brought forth\r\nin a very premature state, but are immediately placed in a marsupium\r\nor pouch under the abdomen, where, attached to the little teats, they\r\nreceive their nourishment. They are thus protected and carried by the\r\nmother as long as such care is necessary. The opossum, the only native\r\nmarsupial of the United States, is about twenty inches long, exclusive\r\nof the peculiar rat-like, prehensile tail, by which the animal often\r\nsuspends itself from the branches of trees. When in danger, it feigns\r\ndeath as a way of escape—and can survive injuries that would be fatal to\r\nmost animals. They were once very numerous in this country, and though\r\ndestructive to fruit and poultry, are of some value. Their flesh is\r\nused by some, and the skins are in demand, the hair or coarse fur being\r\nwrought into felt.\r\n\r\nORDER III. _Edentata_[19] (toothless). Animals without incisors, and\r\nhaving separate clawed toes, are included under this order. The chief\r\nrepresentatives are the Armadillos, Sloths and Ant-eaters.\r\n\r\nArmadillos[20] are remarkable animals, with a covering of horny plates,\r\nnot unlike a tortoise shell, but arranged in sections in a way that\r\nallows more freedom of motion. Some of the extinct species were of\r\ngigantic proportions. A fossil armadillo found near the La Plate was as\r\nlarge as a full grown rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThe Sloths are natives of South America. They are covered with long,\r\ncoarse, gray-and-black hair, resembling the moss of the trees in which\r\nthey live, for these animals are arboreal, while the other members of the\r\norder burrow.\r\n\r\nAnt-eaters, of which there are several varieties, are covered with spines\r\nlike the hedge-hog. Even the long, rough tongue and palate are provided\r\nwith the sharp little spines with which they spear and hold their prey.\r\nTheir claws also are fitted for digging into the ant hills, where the\r\nfood is obtained. They are very inferior mammals, but have their place,\r\nand are useful in destroying noxious insects.\r\n\r\nThe giant ant-eater of South America is much the largest of the genus,\r\nand an animal of considerable strength. From its long, bill-like snout it\r\nthrusts out its longer tongue, and the frantic ants, disturbed in their\r\nquarters, on rushing out stick to it, and are rapidly swept into the\r\nmouth. When sleeping, it is coiled up under its immense bushy tail and\r\nlooks more like a little heap of dried grass than an animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANT-EATER.]\r\n\r\nORDER IV.—_Sirenia_[21] (sea cows), include the Manatee, found between\r\nthe Amazon and Southern Florida, and the Dugong, of India. They are\r\namphibious milk givers. In appearance and structure they are very unlike\r\nmost mammals. Their forelimbs resemble fins, having fingers or toes.\r\nThe hind legs are wanting, and the tail like that of a fish, but they\r\nsuckle their young, sometimes supporting them for the purpose with their\r\nflippers.\r\n\r\nORDER V.—_Cetacea_[22] (Whales). They are much the largest of mammals.\r\nThey live entirely in the sea, and have in general a fish-like\r\nappearance. Their forelimbs are huge paddles, the others being only\r\nrudimentary. But they produce their young well developed, and nourish\r\nthem with an abundance of rich, creamy milk. The amount of blood in a\r\nlarge whale must be immense, the great artery being a foot in diameter,\r\nevery pulsation of the heart forces many gallons along the channels\r\nprepared for it. A single whale, captured in 1884 by the crew of a New\r\nLondon vessel, produced whalebone and oil worth $15,720, beside other\r\nproducts of considerable value.\r\n\r\nORDER VI.—_Insectivora_ (insect eating). An order of small animals,\r\nhaving well developed teeth, the molars remarkable for their sharp cusps;\r\nand five-toed feet furnished with claws. The Mole, Hedge-hog and Shrew\r\nare examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VARIETIES OF BATS.]\r\n\r\nORDER VII.—_Cheiroptera_[23] (wing handed). Bats are not generally\r\nfavorites, and are by many regarded with aversion. Their strange and\r\nrather uncomely forms are seen on wing only in the dim twilight, as they\r\nspend the day mostly in deserted buildings and gloomy caverns. In eastern\r\ncountries, where such receptacles of the dead are common, bats are often\r\nfound in sepulchers or catacombs, and are regarded as fit dwellers\r\nwith desolation and death. There are many species, with enough variety\r\nin their appearance; and the study of their natural history softens\r\nprejudice and reveals much of interest in their structure and habits.\r\n\r\nORDER VIII.—_Rodentia_[24] (gnawing animals). Animals of this order have\r\ntwo large, chisel-like incisors in each jaw, and, separated from them by\r\na wide space, are the molar teeth. The incisors never cease growing from\r\nthe roots, but are constantly worn away by nibbling. The lower jaw moves\r\nbackward and forward. This order includes more than half of the known\r\nmammals, and its representatives range from the equator to the poles.\r\nHares, Mice, Rats, Squirrels, and Beavers are among those best known.\r\n\r\nORDER IX.—_Ungulata_[25] (hoofed animals). An order of mammals most\r\nvaluable to man. They are grouped in two divisions, according to\r\nthe number of toes. The uneven-toed ungulates include the Elephant,\r\nRhinoceros and Horse. The elephant is marked by the prolongation of the\r\nnose and upper lip into a trunk or proboscis, which is said to contain\r\nover 40,000 muscles. It has no canine teeth, and incisors only in the\r\nlower jaw. Elephants are found in Asia and Africa. There are two extinct\r\nspecies, the mastodon and mammoth. The rhinoceros is a native of Africa\r\nand India. It is an immense animal, covered by a hairless skin, which\r\nlies in folds on the body. The nose bears one or two horns, which grow\r\nsometimes three feet in length. The horse includes animals having one toe\r\nupon each foot, upon which they walk. The family includes the Ass, Zebra\r\nand Quagga.\r\n\r\nThe even-toed ungulates include all the _Ruminates_, or cud chewing\r\nanimals, with the Swine and Hippopotamus. The ruminants are remarkable\r\nfor their peculiar method of digesting their food. They possess a very\r\npeculiar stomach, of four compartments. The food, mixed with saliva,\r\nis swallowed and passes into a paunch where it is mingled with water,\r\nand then forced into what is called the honey-comb stomach, a sack in\r\nwhich the food is formed into cuds, and by a muscular arrangement is\r\nforced back into the mouth to be masticated a second time before passing\r\ndirectly into the third stomach or manyplies, where it is strained, and\r\nthen driven into the true stomach to be acted upon by the gastric juice\r\nand assimilated.\r\n\r\nThe deer is a fine representative of the ruminant, with solid branching\r\nhorns. Like all ruminants it has two toes. There is a large class of\r\ncud-chewers having hollow horns, which usually are not shed, as are the\r\nsolid horns. The Buffalo, Ox, Sheep, Goat and Antelope belong to this\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OX SKELETON.\r\n\r\n10, horns; 8, spine; A, cervical, B B, dorsal, C, lumbar, D, sacral,\r\nand E E caudal vertebræ; F F, ribs; G, sternum and cartilages; R, ossa\r\ninnominata; H, scapula; I, humerus; K, radius; L, ulna; N, metacarpal; S,\r\nfemur; T, patella; U, tibia; V, hock; X, metatarsal; Y, small metatarsal;\r\nP, sesamoids; Y, bones of tarsus, nine in number.

The camel also belongs here. The true camel\r\nhas two fatty humps upon its back; another species, called the dromedary,\r\nhas but a single hump. The camel has a peculiar modification of one\r\ncompartment of the ruminant stomach. The paunch is divided into cells\r\nwhich hold supplies of water.\r\n\r\nORDER X.—_Carnivora_ (flesh-eaters). The distinguishing characteristics\r\nof this order are sharp canine teeth, and one molar on each side in\r\nthe upper and lower jaw, longer and sharper than the rest; and feet\r\nwhich are provided with toes, generally supplied with claws. According\r\nto the modifications of the feet they are divided into _Pinnigrades_,\r\n_Plantigrades_ and _Digitigrades_. The first have short, webbed feet\r\nwhich they use as paddles for swimming, and are represented by Seals\r\nand Walruses. These are amphibious mammals of a high order. They spend\r\nmuch of their time in the water, and both the form and covering of their\r\nbodies are adapted to their aquatic mode of life. They swim and dive\r\nwith the greatest facility. The soft woolly down, close to the skin, is\r\ncovered with a coat of long, smooth, shining hairs which lie close to the\r\nbody, offering no resistance to their passage through the water. Their\r\nskins and oil are of considerable mercantile importance. The Plantigrades\r\ninclude those animals which in walking place the sole of the foot flat\r\nupon the ground. Such are Bears and Raccoons. The Digitigrades are those\r\nwhich walk on the toes, as Weasels, Foxes, Dogs, Cats, Lions and Tigers.\r\n\r\nORDER XI.—_Primates_ are at the head of the animal kingdom. The\r\ndistinguishing characteristics of this class are the more erect carriage\r\nof the body, a hand better adapted for use, its fingers being furnished\r\nwith nails, and a thigh free from the body. The order includes the\r\nLemurs, Monkeys, Apes and Man. The lowest division of the primates, the\r\nlemurs, are small animals whose bodies are covered with hair. They have\r\na fox-like face, a pointed nose, large ears, and a long tail, and they\r\nwalk on all fours. The monkeys have long prehensile tails, and though\r\ntheir hands can be used for grasping, the thumbs are not opposable. A\r\ndistinguishing mark is the number of teeth; they have thirty-six instead\r\nof thirty-two, as the apes and man. Among the monkeys are the Baboon, the\r\nHowling Monkeys, the Mandril, and the Sleepers of Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe apes are more erect than the monkeys, have no tail, and have longer\r\narms. The division includes the Orang-Outang of Borneo and Sumatra, the\r\nChimpanzee, of Africa, and the Gorilla of Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\nMan commands the highest physical development among the primates. In him\r\nthe partially erect position of the monkey and ape becomes complete. His\r\nlimbs are more nearly equal in length and more perfectly developed than\r\nthose of other primates, the skull is larger, the forehead more rounded,\r\nand the brain nearly twice the size of that of the gorilla, the dentition\r\nis more perfect, the teeth being regular and rarely protruding. The great\r\ndistinction between man and the lower primates is that of mind. He alone,\r\nof all animals, possesses the power of articulate speech, of forming\r\nabstract ideas, and of reasoning.\r\n\r\n    _End of Required Reading for the Year 1884-85._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER HOMES FOR THE CITY POOR.\r\n\r\nBY HELEN CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho began it?\r\n\r\nThe germ theory.\r\n\r\nThis answer may be regarded as not strictly to the point, yet it is\r\ncertain that it holds the truth more nearly than any statement which\r\nmight give New York or Philadelphia as the first cause. By this\r\nmysterious law, which from time to time we encounter in settling\r\nprecisely such questions, minds entirely remote and with no kinship of\r\nfaith or mutual purpose, felt the sudden moving toward action practically\r\nsimultaneous. A hint of things to come had been given half a dozen years\r\nbefore, but full action waited for the Centennial year of 1876.\r\n\r\nUp to this time summer rest, save for the rich, had been regarded as a\r\nneedless luxury. Increased knowledge of sanitary laws had demonstrated\r\nthat change of air might be as vital a necessity for poor as for rich.\r\nBut that this applied also to the lowest and most helpless classes had no\r\nplace save in the mind of a practical philanthropist here and there. Nor\r\nhad it yet become a part of the creed of such workers, and, far less, a\r\nsubject of common discussion among those who sought the most practical\r\nmethods of help, that the children were the ones to whom such help would\r\nmean the most. Charity concerned itself chiefly with alleviation, and\r\nlooked in more and more hopeless dismay on the ever-increasing numbers of\r\nthis army of incapables. It was evident to all who walked through city\r\nstreets as August sunshine blazed on squalid home and reeking gutter,\r\nand gaunt women and pale, unchildlike children came and went in noisome\r\nstreet and alley, that something must be done, but what? A good woman\r\nhad opened a summer home for very young children on Staten Island, and\r\nin 1873 transferred its management to the Children’s Aid Society on\r\nthe understanding that four thousand dollars should be collected to\r\ninsure its success. The founder, Mr. A. P. Stokes, at once gave half\r\nthe amount, and the rest was quickly made up, the headquarters for the\r\nnew home being made at Bath, Long Island, where the work still goes\r\non with largely increased facilities. Beginning with the rental of a\r\nprivate house, in which every inch of space was so utilized that the\r\nparlors became a sleeping room for twenty-four persons, and the carriage\r\nhouse was so made over as to contain nearly sixty beds, it has grown\r\ninto one of the most efficient and beneficent of charities. A week is\r\ngiven to each detachment, chosen most generally from the members of the\r\nindustrial schools under the direction of the Children’s Aid Society.\r\nThe children are abundantly fed, the dietary including milk, bread,\r\nbutter, oatmeal, fruits, vegetables, fish and meats. The salt water is\r\nalmost at the door, while on the other side are woods and wild flowers,\r\nand the children change even in a week of such life, sometimes almost\r\nbeyond recognition. But there are objections to these homes, beautiful as\r\nis their mission in many points, and a writer in the New York _Evening\r\nPost_, after faithful examination of this and other summer homes, writes:\r\n“Neither the excursions, which are only for a day, nor the seaside homes\r\nquite reach the best results. What the pinched sufferers in alley-ways\r\nand courts, garrets and basements need is to be sent to the country. It\r\nis not enough to give them a day on the river, though that is good as\r\nfar as it goes. Even in seaside homes they are housed with children of\r\ntheir own sort; they have the same conversation, the same plays, the same\r\ndepressing companionship with disease and want. What they need is to meet\r\nthe healthy life of the country; to make acquaintance with nature, to\r\nlearn the difference between a calf and a pig; to have a whole new set\r\nof objects before their eyes and mind. The country is a bit of heaven to\r\nsuch children. They catch a new life from it; they bring back into town a\r\nbetter tone of mind, body and morals.”\r\n\r\nSuch had long been the conviction of a woman whose name is synonymous\r\nwith every advance that has been made in wise dealing with social\r\nproblems, and who, as she came and went in the narrow streets and\r\nstifling heat of Philadelphia, yearned always more and more, to give\r\nthe children some hint of what lay almost within their reach, yet\r\ninaccessible as the poles. At the meeting of Progressive Friends in\r\n1876, one of the earliest addresses, and one of the most powerful in\r\nits effects, made an impassioned appeal for an end of dreaming and\r\ntheorizing, and a life of action—action which should mean help to\r\nevery human soul in need of help. There was a flutter of interest and\r\nexcitement as the speaker ended, but no one made suggestion as to what\r\nform such action might take. Great issues were apparently ended. To a\r\ngathering made up in great part of veteran Abolitionists, any other\r\nstruggle seemed weak and puerile, and they looked doubtfully at one\r\nanother as the words ceased.\r\n\r\nThe wise woman saw her time, and when the afternoon meeting brought them\r\ntogether, rose in her place, and in few words told what her eyes had seen\r\nand her heart desired. A buzz of interest and of opposition was heard at\r\nonce. One and another stated objections; objections made by many since\r\nthen, but that have proved no obstacle to the progress of the work. Such\r\nchildren would bring in their train, dirt, disease, vermin, foul language\r\nand general demoralization for every child in the neighborhood who came\r\nin contact with them.\r\n\r\n“Such things are all possible, and may all be anticipated,” said the wise\r\nwoman, who had already in her own experience demonstrated that each and\r\nall could be overcome, “but I think you will find that there are ways of\r\nmeeting them.”\r\n\r\nStill objections were made, and a warm argument was under way, when a\r\nQuaker wife whose eyes flashed from the shade of the close bonnet, and\r\nwhose voice held a ring not unknown even to Quaker gentleness, rose\r\nbefore the debating broad-brims:\r\n\r\n“I’m going to have two of those children, if I have to tie my own to a\r\ntree,” she said, and said no more.\r\n\r\nMore was not needed. The tide had turned, and one and another volunteered\r\nto open the doors and at least make an experiment. And now, curiously\r\nenough, came a difficulty not even imagined; the difficulty of securing\r\nchildren for the offered and waiting places. Fathers and mothers looked\r\nwith dark suspicion on the people who requested the loan of the children.\r\n\r\n“Shure it’s none o’ mine ye’ll be gettin’,” said one of them. “Makin’ out\r\nit’s for play ye’s want ’em, an’ settin’ them to work soon as our eyes is\r\noff of ’em.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not work I’ll have child o’ mine do, long’s I’ve hands that’ll\r\nearn the bit an’ sup she’ll be takin’,” said another, and the children\r\nthemselves, hollow-eyed and haggard, watched the fracas with small\r\ninterest. The first who went out had to be compelled, as it were, to\r\ncome in to the feast, but never again were like measures necessary. The\r\ngood work went on with courage, even with glee. Baths, clean clothes,\r\nplenty to eat, sweet air and sunshine did their work, and the dirty,\r\nforlorn little wretches chosen in the beginning returned home, imploring\r\nfor longer time, and with a new sense of life born in them. Season after\r\nseason the same doors opened, and as the work grew, funds poured in;\r\na method formulated itself, and the management became a model for all\r\nsimilar work elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis is what had happened at one point, but the germ was not a single\r\none, and at another in the same state, another mind had felt the same\r\ntouch, and the same result had come. The project had been talked over\r\nbefore it took positive form, and talked over with a woman, who, from the\r\nupper chamber where long years had held her prisoner to pain, looked out\r\nupon the world through others’ eyes, but with an insight that went to the\r\nheart of all possibilities for help. The young minister who counted her\r\nword as equivalent to the united force of a dozen elders, went home to\r\nhis flock among the Pennsylvania mountains—hard-working farmers from whom\r\nquick response could hardly have been expected—and this is the letter he\r\nwrote on a Sunday when he had spoken to them his first word of the wish\r\nborn a year before:\r\n\r\n                                         “SHERMAN, PA., June 3, 1877.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR MRS. L.:—The ball is set in motion. I took for my text\r\n    this morning, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least\r\n    of these, ye have done it unto me,” and made the practical\r\n    bearing of my words the bringing out into our homes some of the\r\n    waifs and outcasts from the city. One man stopped on his way\r\n    home to say that he would take four. In another house there is\r\n    a call for a mother and a baby, and so on through the town. The\r\n    enthusiasm and response of my people have delighted me.\r\n\r\n    “Next to get the money; then to tell the children. Must not two\r\n    weeks in this pure mountain air be felt by them in after life? It\r\n    seems to me that they are all but here.\r\n\r\n    “Now may I have the introduction you promised me to Dr.\r\n    Eggleston? I shall try for a pass over the road to go back and\r\n    forth with the children myself, and perhaps I can arrange with\r\n    some of these good people on the way to bring us a country lunch\r\n    as the train comes along. Some good angel whisper it in the ear\r\n    of a little one! Tell a tired mother there is life for her child\r\n    in this fresh country air.\r\n\r\n                                                   “WILLARD PARSONS.”\r\n\r\nIt was an unknown name then, but through Dr. Eggleston, then on the point\r\nof sailing for Europe, interest was roused. The Erie Railway officers\r\nproved that corporations have sometimes a soul, and full fares were\r\nreduced to half fares, and half fares to quarter fares, and a pass was\r\ngiven to Mr. Parsons, and on July 19th went out the first group of nine.\r\nThey were mere wraiths of children, crippled, in consumption, enfeebled\r\nfrom whooping cough; each one stamped with disease and pinched and thin\r\nfor want of food. It was doubtful how they could bear the journey.\r\n\r\nThe children who swarmed out next day “to catch raspberries” proved\r\nperfectly manageable, and when their two weeks ended, returned home\r\ntransformed from sad-eyed, prematurely old little figures, into live\r\nchildren, loaded with gifts and crying to stay longer. The story has\r\nbecome a familiar one, but it can never become tedious. The second group\r\ngave less anxiety. The work was better understood. Seventeen boys and\r\ngirls, each wearing a blue ribbon bow as the badge of “country week”\r\nchildren, gathered from all quarters, and all, delicate, half-starved,\r\nsuffering with hip-disease, asthma, and a dozen ailments, met at the Erie\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nThe diary of the summer’s work runs over with small absurdities, with\r\npathos, with promise. Sixty in all shared the good provided for them at\r\na total cost of only one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and sixty-two\r\ncents. But for New York as for Philadelphia, it was easier to get the\r\nmoney than to get the children. Often a pale and care-worn child was\r\nthe breadwinner. “Sometimes the mother had a fear of separation, or the\r\nfeeble, childish hands must tend baby and do the housework while mother\r\ngoes out by the day. ‘It is harder for Jack than for any one else when\r\nthe baby comes,’ one mother said. ‘The care comes on him.’ Baby was in\r\nher arms as she spoke, but Jack was close by, thirteen years old, under\r\nsize, and washing stockings at the tub!”\r\n\r\nIn many cases the children made friends for life, in a few the attachment\r\nformed being so strong that adoption followed. For all of them was the\r\nsame experience; a fortnight or more of bliss and revelation and a\r\nreturn, loaded down with bundles and boxes and bags of the things that\r\neach one chose to gather.\r\n\r\nThat ticks had to be washed and straw burned after the occupation of many\r\nof them, made no apparent difference, and even to-day, when it is all\r\nan old story, and board must in many cases be paid, there is unfailing\r\nconsideration for the tastes and whims of the strangers. Now and then\r\nthere was fright and tears and long wails for mother, soon quieted. Now\r\nand then rebellion and ingratitude; sometimes lying and petty thefts, but\r\nall yielding to kindness.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia, to whose markets the farmers for miles about come in,\r\nthe children were in many cases able to keep up their acquaintance, and\r\nwere often found behind the stalls, in long talks with the friends\r\nwho now and then bundled them into the great Conestoga wagons and gave\r\nthem an unexpected country week. The work has grown at this point, as\r\nin New York, beyond any expectation, and rooms and officers have both\r\nbecome necessary, the modest reports giving small hint of the patient\r\nlabor bestowed. The work was long confined solely to children, with now\r\nand then a worn-out mother smuggled in, but the same eyes that had seen\r\ntheir needs were studying now into possibilities for the class just above\r\nthem—the working girls. Of all grades, from factory to store, all were\r\nliving on the least sum on which body and soul could be kept together,\r\nand all needed quite as strenuously as the children, the change from\r\nnarrow, stifling homes to country air and sights. To accomplish this has\r\nbeen far more difficult than the first undertaking, but has resulted in\r\na success quite as complete. The objections were natural. Children could\r\nbe disciplined and taught even in a week’s stay, but growing or grown\r\ngirls, probably pert, self-sufficient and generally unpleasant, were\r\nquite another matter. It was impossible to say what airs they might not\r\nput on, or what demands they might make, and quiet housewives turned in\r\ndismay from even the thought of such inmates. The same woman who had\r\ndecided that her own children should be temporarily tied up rather than\r\nto stand in the way of more needy ones, opened her doors again, not as\r\na charity, but on the lowest terms that could well be fixed, and half\r\na dozen girls came to her for a fortnight, each paying two dollars per\r\nweek, and finding such interest on the investment as no dollars of their\r\nearning had ever known before. The girls were gentle, quiet, over-worked\r\nand timid, and so far from putting on airs, required all the assurances\r\nthat could be given to make them willing to take the good before them.\r\nOther doors opened at once, and the neighborhood soon found even more\r\ninterest in this phase than had attended work for the children. Girls in\r\nmany cases clubbed together, and it has been found, wherever attempted,\r\nthat three dollars per week for board and washing still leaves a margin\r\nof profit for the entertainers. Home after home has sprung up by the\r\nseashore or in the country proper; but the same objection applies to\r\nmassing girls together that has already been mentioned as affecting the\r\nchildren. Numbers seem always to include inevitable demoralization, and\r\nto develop unpleasant possibilities in even the most inoffensive, and\r\nthe conclusion is the same for both, that the best results follow where\r\nprivate families open their doors and the workings of home life can be\r\npart of the vacation experience. Hints have come in silent ways stronger\r\nthan any words, that have borne fruit in many lives. A new sense has been\r\nborn—a sense of the beauty of order and many a quiet virtue unknown to\r\nthe crowded and scrambling city life, and the lesson has as yet reached\r\nbut the alphabet.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention of this article to describe any one work at\r\nlength, or to define more than the possibilities before us all. More\r\nand more we have come to recognize that only in dealing directly with\r\nthe individual, can any efficient work be done, and this principle now\r\nunderlies the best that the Associated Charities has given us. Summer\r\nrest is but a phase of the wide-reaching work, but not one holds a larger\r\nsignificance. Two or three years ago the writer recorded one case, which,\r\nwhile hardly typical, still shows what may lie in wait for the young soul\r\nof whose possibilities we can never judge in full, and the story is given\r\nagain, as the best illustration of what a country week may mean.\r\n\r\nLong ago in a dull, old street, making part of an equally dull and\r\ncolorless part of old New York, a very solitary child extracted such\r\namusement from life as forty feet of back yard could afford. He sat in\r\nhis small rocking-chair and listened to the talk about him, growing a\r\nlittle paler, a little more uncanny all the time, till one day when a\r\ncountry cousin appeared, and, horrified that anything so old and weazened\r\ncould call itself a boy, begged that he might go home with her.\r\n\r\nThere was infinite objection, but her point was finally carried, and\r\nthe child found himself suddenly in a country village, a great garden\r\nabout the house, a family dog and cat, a cow, an old horse, and all the\r\nbelongings of village life. Old-fashioned flowers were all about, and the\r\nold-fashioned boy sat down in the path by a bed of spice pinks and looked\r\nat them, his hands folded and a species of adoration on his face.\r\n\r\n“Pick some,” said the cousin; “pick as many as you want.”\r\n\r\n“Pick them?” repeated the old-fashioned boy. “I’m afraid to. Ain’t they\r\nGod’s?”\r\n\r\nAn hour later the seven years’ crust had broken once for all, and the\r\nchild, who had to be put to bed exhausted from his scrambles through\r\nand over every unaccustomed thing, began to live the first day of real\r\nchild life. When the time came for his return he begged with such a\r\npassion of eagerness, such storm of sobs and cries for longer stay\r\nthat the unwilling aunt and grandmother left him there, and finding\r\nthe transformation, when he did return, beyond either comprehension or\r\nmanagement, sent him back to the life he craved.\r\n\r\nTo-day he takes rank among American painters, though only heaven knows\r\nhow the possibility of such development found place in this strange\r\noff-shoot of a Philistine race. But he counts his own birthday from the\r\nhour when the first sense of sky and grass and flowers dawned upon him,\r\nand he looked upon the garden that he thought truly God had planted.\r\n\r\nSuch revelation is the portion of few, but for all it comes in\r\ndegree. To aid such revelation is hardly a charity. Is it not rather\r\nself-protection? Men and women in the slums are beyond much power of ours\r\nfor reconstruction or reformation, but the children can be influenced\r\nstill. And so let every one who looks with apprehension at the daily\r\ncriminal record, and wonders what should be done, remember that a very\r\nsmall sum will be one means of giving a chance to some child born to\r\nall evil, whose first sense of something better will come, not through\r\nschool or mission, but through the silent teaching unconsciously working\r\nin them, through every breath of fresh air, every sight of blue sky and\r\nsunshine, and green grass and trees. A “country week” may come from a\r\nvery small sum, but it is an investment on which interest is unending,\r\nand whoever has once made it will find that the pleasure is not for the\r\nchild alone, and that life opens up more possibilities than had come even\r\nto one’s deepest dreams.\r\n\r\nFor those who desire more specific knowledge than that afforded by the\r\nstory of the undertaking as a whole, it is sufficient to give one or\r\ntwo details which will enable any one interested in further examination\r\nof the matter to obtain reports and information from headquarters. For\r\nPhiladelphia these headquarters are at 1112 Girard Street, from which\r\nthe companies of children, registered and numbered, are sent out.\r\nA letter addressed “Officers of the Country Week,” at this number,\r\nwill always receive prompt attention, the work having received formal\r\norganization some years since, and owning a regular board of untiring\r\nand devoted officers. They have come to include now not only children,\r\nbut tired shop-girls, young mothers worn with care, and working women\r\nof all orders, and there is opportunity not only for those who are\r\nwilling to open their houses without charge, but also for those who must\r\ncover expenses, the Board paying wherever necessary, a sum per child,\r\nsufficient to cover these. For New York there is perhaps a trifle less\r\nsystem, but a work equally beneficent, and for all information regarding\r\nit, it is sufficient to address either “The Tribune Fresh Air Fund,” THE\r\nTRIBUNE, Park Row, New York, or the Rev. WILLARD PARSONS, care of New\r\nYork _Tribune_.\r\n\r\nContributions or inquiries either will be welcomed, and matters are\r\nnow so perfectly systematized, that distance to be traveled proves\r\nno obstacle, and even the remotest village on the lines of the great\r\nrailroads may have its share in this most beautiful and essential form of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEARN TO ENJOY PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nBY MARGARET MEREDITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one surpassing beauty of manner which, I think, might be\r\nattained by cultivation—that of taking an interest in people who are\r\ntalking to you, with the subtile added charm of seeming at leisure to\r\nenjoy them as long as they choose to stay.\r\n\r\nWith some it is natural. I was struck to-day with the sweet graciousness\r\nof a young girl, ill dressed (for her) and very busy, who almost deceived\r\nme into wasting ten extra minutes of her precious time, by the satisfied\r\nair with which she sat down beside me in her parlor and welcomed my\r\ninopportune appearance. It was not politic, to be sure, for getting her\r\ncake making done, but, ah how politic for winning admiration!\r\n\r\nOf the few whom I have remarked, in our busy American life, as possessing\r\nthis faculty supremely, one family had long lived abroad, and were\r\npeople of leisure. The look of content, and of being established for an\r\nindefinite time, with which any one of them sat on the sofa before a dull\r\nchance acquaintance, was an imprint, no doubt, of their idle life, but it\r\nwas also the imprint of an exquisite training. It was the quintessence of\r\nthe aristocratic manner.\r\n\r\nWe do not want gilded uselessness; far better remain as we are; busy,\r\neven if chiefly for ourselves; but there are some who, in the midst\r\nof hard work, have been wise enough to leave spare time in their plan\r\nof life for casual meetings with their fellows. I think of two women,\r\nboth, as it happened, the main stay of churches—churches widely removed\r\nin geography and opinion; both were responsible in the care of those\r\nchurches, and both entered with marvelous industry into the details and\r\ninto the drudgery of their work. I heard a servant say of one that she\r\nhad never known her to utter an impatient word when cards were handed\r\nin; while her cordial ways won the hearts of all. The other, older\r\nand poorer, and not versed in the ways of the world, it was even more\r\nwonderful to see sitting hour after hour engrossed and pleased as one and\r\nanother used up her morning; though the standing puzzle among all who\r\nknew her was, how she possibly found time for all she did.\r\n\r\nThis heartiness is more attractive to the small than to the great among\r\none’s friends; for those full of attractions themselves are not so apt\r\nto be received with indifference. It is those modest as to their own\r\nfascinations who are grateful for being made welcome and at home; the\r\nshy girl just emerged from the school room to do her difficult part in\r\nsociety, the old lady who is painfully conscious that she knows very\r\nlittle about the topics of the day, the estimable young man of moderate\r\ncapacity. These must be tolerated—why should they not be made happy?\r\n\r\nI know that I am playing with edged tools, advising an attempt that is\r\nall too apt to end in affectation, even in deceit, an overdone aspect of\r\nadmiration which would disgust; but you can avoid that. Really, about\r\nall you need is to deal strictly with yourself as you walk down stairs\r\nto the parlor; force yourself to stop inwardly fuming that you are\r\ninterrupted, to accept the fact that this is not an interruption, but\r\nprobably a better occupation for you for twenty minutes than that from\r\nwhich you were called, at any rate the inexorable duty of the moment, and\r\nto be discharged as such. Instead of sitting half numb and self-absorbed,\r\ntalking only in the _rôle_ of a machine for receiving a caller, try at\r\nonce to throw yourself quite away from the life upstairs out into the\r\nlife of your visitor. The calls will consume a little more of your time,\r\nwill average a little longer, even in spite of waiting carriages, but\r\nthey will prove a recreation instead of a weariness, and you will gain\r\ntwenty friends where you now gain one.\r\n\r\nA little girl once traveled in the stage-coach with Madame La Vert, and\r\nthe child’s indignant contradiction afterward: “She isn’t a fine lady at\r\nall! She’s just like me, and I love her,” made plain in a sentence the\r\nsecret of her power.\r\n\r\nWhy is not this sympathetic treatment of others aimed at by all? Why\r\nshould the reigning belle be so nice with her tongue and her smile,\r\nand the older woman, who probably feels the want of affection far more\r\nkeenly, be quite oblivious that this same winning kindliness which she\r\nhas so long ceased to exhibit, and has replaced by the dry manner of\r\nformal endurance, would, perhaps as promptly as the wand of Cinderella’s\r\ngod-mother, transform some of these prim callers into life-long friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR LADIES OF SORROW.\r\n\r\nBY MRS.

OSWALD, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is curious how often the first impression of experts has been\r\nconfirmed by the verdict of posterity. During one of his journeys of\r\ninspection Peter the Great visited the mouth of the Volga River and\r\npointed out the advantages of fortifying a certain promontory which a\r\nmilitary commission, after long controversies, has now selected for the\r\nsite of a bombproof arsenal. The gold discoveries in Upper California\r\nwere predicted by Sir Francis Drake; those of the Ural by Baron Humboldt;\r\nand after fifty years of coast surveys, mountain surveys, negotiations,\r\nreports and counter reports, it seems now probable that two American\r\nRepublics will ratify the opinion of Don Rodrigo Contreras, who more than\r\nthree hundred years ago called the attention of the Spanish Government to\r\nthe advantages of the Nicaragua Lake system, and its navigable effluent,\r\nas the rudiment of an inter-oceanic canal, and the superiority of that\r\nroute over those both of Darien and Panama—Tehuantepec having then not\r\nyet entered into competition. This Rodrigo was the son-in-law of Davila\r\nPedrarias, the first governor of Panama, and in his coasting trips\r\nbetween the landings of the southern isthmus had probably noticed a\r\ncircumstance which may yet turn the scales in the decision of the canal\r\nproblem, though it had escaped the attention of the routine sailors of a\r\nlatter age, and perhaps even of some professional engineers who confined\r\nthemselves to the comparison of altimetrical surveys.\r\n\r\nThe matter is this: Along the north shore of the Caribbean Sea the coasts\r\nare deep and rocky, but further south, as the Cordilleras decrease in\r\nelevation, the shore is lined with sandbanks, and can be approached only\r\nthrough shallow estuaries, just as the coasts of the Mediterranean become\r\nsandy at their southeastern extremity, the only point where the circle\r\nof lofty coast ranges is broken by the delta of a swamp river—the depth\r\nof the shore waters being apparently proportioned to the height of the\r\nshore lands. Even single depressions in the chain of a long-stretched\r\ncoast range are often confronted by isolated sandbanks—as if a collapse\r\nof the mountain walls had shoaled the littoral sea. But at Panama that\r\ntendency is aggravated by another cause. For the last two hundred years\r\nthe line of the overland route has followed the Rio Chagres and its\r\nwestern tributaries; the adjoining hill country became studded with\r\nsettlements, and, as usual in Spanish colonies, “civilization” led to\r\nforest destruction and progressive aridity. The abundant rains of the\r\nsummer solstice, which were formerly absorbed by the not less exuberant\r\nvegetation of a tropical coast region, now reach the valley in the form\r\nof raging torrents, saturated with the mould of the treeless hill-slopes;\r\nand the alluvium deposited at the river mouth has thus gradually formed\r\nsilt banks, against which the repeated improvements of the estuary have\r\nproved only a temporary remedy. The Russians had a similar experience\r\nwith the port of Azof, once the best harbor in the basin of the Euxine;\r\nbut after the destruction of the inland forests the naked hills of the\r\nDon revenged themselves by a hydra growth of dunes that defied all\r\nexpedients of human skill, and after diking and dredging away some ninety\r\nmillion roubles, the government yielded to Nemesis and removed the\r\nwharves to the harbor of Taganrog. In order to enable vessels of deeper\r\ndraught to enter the mouth of the Chagres, the canal itself would have\r\nto be supplemented by a _channel mole_, a marine canal of nine miles,\r\nprotected by dikes which in their turn might become a source of peril\r\nto sailing vessels approaching the estuary during the prevalence of the\r\nfrequent gales which make the headlands of the southern Caribbean so many\r\nGuardafuis.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of San Juan de Nicaragua, on the contrary, is remarkably free\r\nfrom storms, and the San Juan is not a swamp river. It is the effluent\r\nof a chain of rockbound lakes, one of them of sufficient extent to\r\nequalize the drainage of torrents from above, so that an overflow of\r\nthe San Juan could be caused only by the simultaneous rising of all its\r\nlower tributaries, aided by a northwest gale that would drive the waters\r\nof the lake toward the estuary. A conjunction of that sort occurred in\r\nthe summer of 1872, when the San Juan rose some twenty feet in as many\r\nhours; but even then the river did not shoal its delta, but tore out a\r\nnew channel through Costa Rican territory, which now receives a lion’s\r\nshare of the outflow; but there is no doubt that an isolated mishap of\r\nthat sort can be remedied by a short-line canal from the coast to a point\r\nabove the divergence of the rival streams, or by the same means that\r\nreclaimed the channel of the Mississippi at New Orleans. Further up all\r\nserious difficulties cease. The rapids of the San Juan can be passed\r\nby locks of moderate depth, the total difference between the level of\r\nLake Nicaragua and that of the Atlantic being hardly twenty-five feet.\r\nThe lake itself will need no improvements. Throughout its breadth of\r\nseventy-five miles (three fifths of the distance from ocean to ocean)\r\nit maintains an average depth of fifteen fathoms, has no dangerous\r\nsandbanks, no driftwood islands, while its undercurrents secure it\r\nagainst the danger of being shoaled by the floods of its affluents. The\r\nproject of locating the western terminus at Port Brito, on the Pacific,\r\nwould reduce the length of the canal proper to about twenty-eight miles,\r\nand shorten the trip for vessels from our ports by nearly seven hundred\r\nmiles—the distance from Port Brito to Panama.\r\n\r\nThe question is, if all these advantages would justify the construction\r\nof a second canal. For we need not delude ourselves with the fear—or\r\nhope—that the Panama project would be abandoned; the _present_ interests\r\nof the French stockholders, if not the name of Monsieur de Lesseps, is a\r\nguarantee that their work will be completed. They have gone too far[A]\r\nto retreat before the completion of a single rival; for on the other\r\nhand it is equally sure that the Tehuantepec scheme has lost its last\r\nhope of practical support, since even the promise of a monopoly could\r\nhardly override the veto of Nature. It is enough to say that the Mexican\r\nprojectors admit that the proposed route through the lowest gap of the\r\nChimalapa Range would require the construction of _one hundred and forty\r\nlocks_—with the alternative of tunneling through thirty miles of granite\r\nrocks—for we know how nearly a difference of fifteen locks defeated the\r\nchances of the Wellington canal against its American rivals.\r\n\r\nNor should we, in this respect, underrate the advantages of the Panama\r\nroute. The distance from ocean to ocean is only forty-eight miles,\r\nagainst one hundred and fifteen at Nicaragua, and two hundred and twelve\r\nat Tehuantepec, and neither hills nor rocks oppose any obstacle that\r\ncould not be overcome by the conqueror of Suez. Yet there remains a\r\nconsideration which in connection with the result of other comparisons\r\nmust leave a preponderance of arguments in favor of Nicaragua. For three\r\nfifths of the year the valley of the Rio Chagres is a reeking hotbed of\r\nmalaria,[B] and from Aspinwall to Panama only dreary sandhills alternate\r\nwith festering swamps. Nicaragua, on the other hand, is the healthiest\r\nregion between Chili and California, and offers scenic attractions\r\nabsolutely unequaled in any other part of the New World, and which can\r\nhardly have been surpassed when the Mediterranean peninsulas were still\r\nclad in the glory of their primeval forests. I visited the lake region\r\nof Nicaragua in 1875, after having seen California, the West Indies,\r\nand the highlands of Mexico, and only here I relinquished my doubt that\r\nthe international park of Switzerland had, after all, a transatlantic\r\nrival. The harbor of San Juan is nearly a thousand miles from anything\r\nan Anglo-American would call civilization, and since their Walker and\r\nSpalding experiences the natives are, on the whole, rather inclined\r\nto dispense with the patronage of enterprising foreigners; but, for\r\nall that, the time is near when the islands of Lake Nicaragua will\r\nbe studded with international hotels. The luxuriance of the tropical\r\nhill forests is equaled in the mountains of Oaxaca; the climate is\r\nnot superior to that of the northern Antilles; but the scenery of\r\nthe highlands, with their fourteen active volcanoes, would turn the\r\nscales. Of the forty-six craters in the maritime Cordilleras, five are\r\neruptive and nine smouldering and smoking volcanoes, besides a score of\r\n_infernillos_—smoking caves and fissures, opening in the rocks of the\r\nfoothills, as if the obstruction of the roof-chimneys had forced the\r\nsubterranean fires to break a vent through the basement of the Sierra.\r\nAnd, moreover, these craters are, with few exceptions, of easy access\r\nfrom both sides of the mountains, and at all seasons of the year. The\r\nclimate of Nicaragua enjoys the advantages of the real tropics. In\r\nthe western hemisphere that term is as ambiguous as the “beginning of\r\nspring.” At Brownsville, Texas, nearly twelve hundred miles further south\r\nthan Naples, I have seen snowstorms that would appall a Shetlander; and\r\neven in Mexico frosts are not confined to the upper tablelands. But the\r\ntraveler who reaches the fourteenth parallel has left the winter zone\r\nbehind. In Leon, near the northwest end of the lake system, he will\r\nfind butterflies in December, and when he sits down to his Christmas\r\ndinner of sweetmeats and broiled bananas, mine host will introduce a\r\n_caza-moscas_, or fly-brush boy. _Moscas_ of a larger variety also infest\r\nthe lagoons of the old town, but mosquitoes are rare, and further inland\r\nunknown, for Leon is the gate city of the western highlands, one of its\r\nsuburbs being only a short distance from the foothills of the Cerro de\r\nlas Pilas, a naked peak whose summit affords a complete panorama of\r\nthe lake region and the coast range. In the north the Sierra Madre of\r\nHonduras looms on the horizon like a white-crested cloud, flanked by the\r\nblue ridge of the coast range, and the volcanic domes of the central\r\nplateau which attains its maximum altitude in the uplands of Matagalpa.\r\nBut forty miles southeast of Leon the great tableland which stretches\r\nin an almost unbroken line from Denver across Mexico and the highlands\r\nof Central America is intersected by the basin of the Isthmus lakes;\r\nand here, as if the disruption of the Sierra had opened a vent for the\r\nfurnaces of the nether world, volcanoes and hot springs are massed in\r\na way which to my knowledge is paralleled only in the Island of Java,\r\nwhere a highland region of twelve hundred square miles is veiled with\r\nthe almost perpetual smoke of its burning mountains. About twenty miles\r\nnorth of Las Pilas the continuity of the coast range is broken, and the\r\nmain chain seems to be segregated into numerous isolated mountain groups,\r\neach of them crowned with two or three volcanic cones. At the end of the\r\ncape which forms the breakwater of the sound known as the Estero Real\r\nstands the volcano of Conseguina, the Vesuvius of the New World. In one\r\nof its last eruptions it caused an inundation by completely obstructing\r\nthe outlet of the Rio Casco, and in 1835 it scattered its ashes as far\r\nas La Guayra and Tehuantepec, _i. e._, over a circle fourteen hundred\r\nmiles in diameter. The head of the bay is begirt by the dolerite cliffs\r\nof two other volcanoes, one of which fronts the shore with a sheer\r\nprecipice of 4,400 feet, rising from a pedestal of rock colonnades\r\nwith cavernous interspaces where trickling springs have generated a\r\nrank vegetation of climbing evergreens. The same arrangement repeats\r\nitself at the head of Lake Managua, where the volcano of Monotombo\r\nrises in tower-like basalt cliffs to a vertical height of 7,400 feet.\r\nProfessor Vanhouten, of the canal survey, makes the highest point of the\r\npeak 7,700—at all events a thousand feet more than the summit of Mount\r\nWashington. The “South Dome” of the Yosemite, if my memory serves me\r\nright, rises hardly 5,000 feet above the valley, and the granite front\r\nof the “Captain” considerably less than 4,000, while the grandeur of the\r\nbasalt coliseum is yet doubled by the mirror of the Island Sea, as the\r\nfirst colonists translated the Indian name of Lake Managua. The lake\r\nis dotted with wooded islands which accompany the south shore into the\r\nstrait of Panalaya, and where that strait opens into the broad basin of\r\nthe lower lake, the islands, too, expand, two of them so much, indeed,\r\nas to have mountain ranges, broad valleys and secondary lakes of their\r\nown. Like all the higher ridges those island mountains culminate in\r\nvolcanoes; the steep peak of Ometepec rises to a height of 5,200 feet,\r\nand gives its island the form of a pyramid. West, east, and north of\r\nboth lakes volcanoes rise above the shore mountains in all directions,\r\nand northeast of Lake Managua not less than seven of them stand close\r\ntogether, like the peaks of the Sieben-gebirge, on the upper Rhine. The\r\nvolcano of Chiltepec can be recognized by its cloven peak, the upper\r\npart of the cone having collapsed during one of its eruptions; Tellica\r\nand Santa Clara by the smoke trails of their ever-seething craters. The\r\n“Hell of Mesaya,” sixty miles further south, has the deepest crater of\r\nany known volcano, as Kilauea has the widest, and Stromboli the most\r\nobstreperous. The upper two thousand feet of the cone form a mere shell,\r\nand from the brink of the crater the spectator looks down into a dizzy\r\nabyss of trachite cliffs, rent by vertical fissures, and now and then\r\nveiled by the eruption of a smoke whirl. From the hills on the east\r\nshore of the lake the prospect toward the peaks of the island mountains\r\naffords views of marvelous and almost incomparable beauty. Yet all\r\nalong the shores of that lake land, with the exception of the richest\r\nalluvial creek estuaries, can be bought for three dollars an acre, even\r\non flat topped bluffs and near rock springs in sheltered dells, more\r\ninviting than the finest artificial parks. Thus far only camping British\r\nsportsmen have now and then availed themselves of such opportunities,\r\nthough Nicaragua offers hunting grounds to the lovers of nearly every\r\nkind of outdoor pastime and science. Geologists can watch the active\r\noperations of the Titans that have transformed so large a portion of\r\nour planet. Antiquarians can here find treasures, from the tomb of a\r\nToltec warrior to the monuments of a buried city; the neighborhood of\r\nSan Carlos and Mayagalpa is covered with ruins, and on the island of\r\nZapotera colossal idols rise like sphinxes from the ground and from the\r\ndebris of fallen temples. Naturalists can watch the jaguar and the tapir\r\nin their native haunts, catch butterflies enough to stock a museum,\r\nstudy the habits of five different species of quadrumana, including the\r\nlarge Coaiti (_Lagothrix paniscus_), with his spider arms and strange,\r\nflute-like cries, can visit the bat caves of Dipilta or the bird islands\r\nof Bluefield’s Lagoon, that make Nicaragua a zoological epitome of the\r\nAmerican tropics, and offer a winter asylum to legions of feathered\r\nrefugees from the North.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua the rainy season ends in November, and the winters are dry\r\nand pleasant, and far less capricious than in Florida, where sultry Gulf\r\nwinds so often alternate with very perceptible polar waves. Nicaragua\r\nwill become the winter rendezvous of American tourists. An international\r\nhighway, built by American engineers and American capital, would soon\r\naggregate North American settlements that would add to the charms of a\r\ntropical garden-land a feeling of security which the traveler in other\r\nparts of Spanish America must generally forego; villas, watering places,\r\nand hotels for the accommodation of winter guests will spring up by\r\nscores, and the canal will soon become something more than a thoroughfare\r\nof international travel. The stockholders of such an investment could\r\nwell dispense with a formal protectorate, and the obstacle of the\r\nClayton-Bulwer treaty[C] is precisely analogous to the scruple which\r\nno politician would blame Prince Bismarck for setting aside in the\r\nCongo affair. In both cases England had for years the refusal of an\r\nopportunity which she failed to improve, and in the unwritten by-laws of\r\ninternational ethics the _iners non obstet_ is a rule which held good\r\neven in the Black Sea controversy. Besides, the alternative of a French\r\nmonopoly and eventual protectorate in Panama may help to moderate the\r\nopponents of the Monroe Doctrine.[D]\r\n\r\nWhile Nicaragua will be visited for its own sake, Panama, like Vera Cruz\r\nand Cayenne, will be shunned by northern travelers, though considerations\r\nof proximity will secure it the inter-oceanic traffic of South America.\r\nVessels carrying tobacco from Brazil to Peru, or guano from Peru to\r\nCaracas, will prefer the risk of the Chagres fever swamps to the certain\r\ndisadvantages of a voyage around the distant south cape of the continent.\r\n\r\nNicaragua will compete with Switzerland, Italy, and the winter resorts\r\nof southern California, as well as with our transcontinental railways.\r\nPanama will compete with Cape Horn.\r\n\r\n[A] The Panama _Star and Herald_ reports that $68,000,000 of the total\r\nappropriation of $120,000,000 have already been expended. The preliminary\r\nsurveys alone cost 7,000,000 francs. After the plan of Monsieur de\r\nLesseps the canal will be thirty feet deep, one hundred and twenty feet\r\nwide, and about forty-six miles long.\r\n\r\n[B] Panama (the city), too, is one of the unhealthiest spots on earth.\r\nTwo months ago (January 2, 1885) the wife of Monsieur Jules Dingler, the\r\nDirector-General of the Canal Company, succumbed to the same fever that\r\nhad cost the lives of all her children. Dr. Ferdinand Lahr, the Sanitary\r\nSuperintendent, died on the same day.\r\n\r\n[C] Captain Bedford Pim, of the British navy, states various reasons that\r\nwould insure the tolerance, or even the coöperation of Great Britain. He\r\nestimates the aggregate cost at $200,000,000, and believes that England,\r\nunder certain conditions, would assume one half of the demanded guarantee\r\nof three per cent. interest.\r\n\r\n[D] It is a curious fact that the originator of that doctrine is not\r\nan American, but a British statesman. George Canning, on the eve of\r\nhis departure for Verona, having got an inkling of a South-European\r\nfederation for the purpose of assisting Spain in the reconquest of her\r\nlost transatlantic possessions, postponed his trip and put himself in\r\ncommunication with the American minister, in order to call the attention\r\nof our government to the favorable opportunity for asserting the claims\r\nof a counter alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY OF THE HEAVENS FOR JUNE.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. M. B. GOFF,\r\n\r\nWestern University of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN.\r\n\r\n    “’Tis by thy secret, strong attractive force,\r\n     As with a chain indissoluble bound,\r\n     Thy system rolls entire; from the far bourne\r\n     Of utmost Saturn, wheeling wide his round\r\n     Of thirty years, to Mercury, whose disk\r\n     Can scarce be caught by philosophic eye,\r\n     Lost in the near effulgence of thy blaze.”\r\n\r\nHad our poet written his _Summer_ in 1781, the year in which Uranus was\r\ndiscovered, instead of 1727; or could he have waited till 1846, his\r\n“utmost Saturn wheeling wide his round of thirty years” would probably\r\nhave been changed and in beautifully flowing verse would have been\r\nexpressed the wonderful fact of “utmost Neptune, wheeling wide his round,\r\nwhose years could only be by four and sixty and one hundred told.” So\r\nmuch in one respect had astronomy grown in a little more than a century.\r\nBut we could have no heart to blame our poet’s neglect of our “utmost”\r\nplanets, even had he known of their existence, since he was so evidently\r\nin earnest in giving its due to our glorious orb, recognized to-day as\r\nthe source of all our light, and heat, and life.\r\n\r\n    “From brightening fields of ether fair disclosed,\r\n     CHILD of the SUN, refulgent Summer comes,\r\n     In pride of youth, and felt through Nature’s depth;\r\n     He comes, attended by the _Hours_\r\n     And ever-fanning _Breezes_, on his way;\r\n     While from his ardent look, the turning _Spring_\r\n     Averts her blushful face; and earth and skies,\r\n     All-smiling, to his hot dominion leaves.\r\n\r\n      …\r\n\r\n    “When now, no more the alternate Twins are fired,\r\n     And Cancer reddens with the Solar blaze,\r\n     Short is the doubtful empire of the Night;\r\n     And soon, observant of approaching Day,\r\n     The meek-eyed Morn appears, mother of Dews,\r\n     At first faint-gleaming in the dappled East;\r\n     Till far o’er Ether spreads the widening glow;\r\n     And, from before the luster of her face,\r\n     White break the clouds away.”\r\n\r\nHad our poetic friend, Thompson, lived in Meadville or New York, instead\r\nof London, he would not even on the 21st of June, have been so much\r\ndisposed to sing:\r\n\r\n    “Short is the doubtful empire of the Night;”\r\n\r\nfor the shortest night of New York is over an hour longer than the\r\nshortest night of London. But what were Meadville and New York in 1727?\r\nJune 21st is our longest day, in latitude 41° 30′, a little more than\r\nfifteen hours from sunrise to sunset; the night, of course, a little\r\nless than nine hours. On this day the sun reaches his northern limit,\r\n23° 27′ 3.2″, and at 2:42 a. m. begins his southern journey; or, to put\r\nit astronomically, the sun enters _Gemini_, and summer begins, on June\r\n21st, at 1:42 a. m. On the 1st, sun rises at 4:31 a. m., sets at 7:24 p.\r\nm.; on the 16th, rises at 4:29 a. m., sets at 7:32 p. m.; and on the 30th\r\nrises at 4:33 a. m., sets at 7:34 p. m. Many persons judging from the\r\ntemperature will be inclined to think on the 21st that the sun must be at\r\nmidday directly above their head; but it will have an elevation of not\r\nmore than 73°.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOON\r\n\r\nEnters upon its last quarter on the 5th, at 6:56 p. m.; new moon on the\r\n12th, at 5:34 p. m.; first quarter, 19th, at 8:40 a. m.; and full on the\r\n27th, at 6:09 a. m. Farthest from the earth on the 28th, at 12:54 a. m.;\r\nnearest the earth on the 13th, at 11:12 a. m. Greatest elevation, 66° 56′\r\n25″, on the 13th; least elevation, 30° 2′ 40″, on the 27th. Rises on the\r\n1st, at 10:15 p. m.; sets on the 16th, at 10:41 p. m.; and rises on the\r\n30th, at 9:27 p. m.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY\r\n\r\nWill be our morning star till the 27th, after which it will be evening\r\nstar till the end of the month. On the 1st it will rise at 3:34 a. m.,\r\nor about one hour earlier than the sun, and can probably be seen by good\r\neyes. On the 16th, it will rise at 3:46 a. m.; and on the 30th, will set\r\nat 7:51 p. m., or a few minutes after sunset, but will be too near the\r\nsun to be visible. Its motion will be direct, amounting to 59° 50′. Its\r\ndiameter will decrease from 7″ to 5″. On the 5th, at 2:00 p. m., will be\r\n48′ south of Neptune; on the 11th, at 10:57 a. m., 2° 57′ north of the\r\nmoon; on the 23d, at 11:00 p. m., 1° 41′ north of Saturn; on the 24th, at\r\n3:00 a. m., in perihelion (nearest the sun); and on the 27th, at 10:00 a.\r\nm., in superior conjunction with the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS,\r\n\r\nAlthough she acts the part of an evening star, is rather “mild” this\r\nmonth. She rises after the sun, and sets on the 1st, at 7:56; on the\r\n16th, at 8:20; and on the 30th, at 8:33 p. m. Her diameter increases four\r\ntenths of a second of arc; and she makes a direct motion of 40° 3′. On\r\nthe 7th, at 5:00 p. m., she is 1° 32′ north of Saturn; on the 13th, at\r\n10:54 a. m., 5° 48′ north of the moon; and on the 26th, at 3:00 p. m., in\r\nperihelion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARS\r\n\r\nHas a direct motion of 22° 6′; his diameter remains constant, 4.4″,\r\nduring the month. Can be seen at the early dawn. He rises at the\r\nfollowing times: On the 1st, at 3:22; on the 16th, at 2:59; and on the\r\n30th, at 2:33 a. m. On the 10th, at 6:00 p. m., 1° 29′ north of Neptune;\r\non the 10th, at 7:55 p. m., 3° 51′ north of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER\r\n\r\n“Speaks for himself” every evening this month. On the 1st, he rises at\r\n10:34 a. m., and on the 2d sets at 12:06 a. m.; on the 16th, rises at\r\n9:50 a. m., and sets at 11:16 p. m.; and on the 30th, rises at 9:03 a.\r\nm., and sets at 10:23 p. m. He has a direct motion of 4° 2′ 31″; and his\r\ndiameter decreases from 34″ to 31.6″. On the 17th, at 9:44 a. m., he is\r\n3° 44′ north of the moon. It may interest the general reader to know that\r\nwhile he is admiring, night after night, this beautiful body making its\r\nway through the “lesser lights” of the heavens, that the astronomer is\r\nlaboring diligently to discover its properties and learn with exactness\r\nits motions. From the last report of Prof. G. W. Hough, Director of the\r\nDearborn Observatory, Chicago, we find that “the disk of Jupiter was\r\nobserved on every favorable occasion, and micrometric measures made on\r\nthe principal spots and markings, including the great red spot first\r\nremarked in 1878.” These observations were made principally with a view\r\nto obtaining the time of revolution of the planet on its axis; and the\r\nresult of the observations from September 12, 1883, to June 11, 1884, a\r\nperiod during which the planet made 660 revolutions, was a mean of 9h.\r\n55m. 38.5s., which differs from the mean of five years’ observation by\r\n1.5s.; the former mean being that much greater than the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURN\r\n\r\nWill be evening star till the 18th; after which date, morning star till\r\nthe end of the month. On the 1st, rises at 5:40 a. m., and sets at 8:24\r\np. m.; on the 16th, rises at 4:47 a. m., sets at 7:31 p. m.; on the 30th,\r\nrises at 4:00 a. m., sets at 6:44 p. m.; from which it will be seen that\r\nexcept during the first part of the month it will be invisible to the\r\nnaked eye. Its diameter is 15.6″ and does not change to the amount of\r\none tenth of a second during the month. On the 7th, at 5:00 p. m., 1°\r\n32′ south of Venus; on the 13th, at 1:19 a. m., 4° 3′ north of the moon;\r\non the 18th, at 6:00 p. m., is in conjunction with the sun; on the 23d,\r\nat 11:00 p. m., 1° 41′ south of Mercury. This planet has also been the\r\nsubject of observation from the Dearborn Observatory, for the purpose of\r\ndetecting markings on the rings; but “nothing indicating a division in\r\nthe outer ring has ever been noticed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nURANUS.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st, this planet rises at 1:10 p. m.; on the 2nd, it sets at\r\n1:18 a. m.; on the 16th, rises at 12:12 p. m., and on the 17th, sets at\r\n12:18 a. m.; on the 30th, rises at 11:18 a. m., and sets at 11:24 p. m.\r\nDecreases in diameter two tenths of a second; and has a direct motion of\r\n14″ 30′. On the 5th, at 1.00 p. m., it appears stationary; on the 19th,\r\nat 10:15 a. m., is 55′ north of the moon; on same date, at 10:00 p. m.,\r\nis 90° east of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPTUNE\r\n\r\nIs a morning star throughout the month, and has a direct motion of 1° 0′\r\n16″. Diameter increases from 2.5″ to 2.6″. It rises as follows: On the\r\n1st, at 3:47; on the 16th, at 2:49; and on the 30th, at 1:56 a. m. On the\r\n5th, at 2:00 p. m., is 48′ north of Mercury; on the 10th, at 6:00 p. m.,\r\n1° 29′ south of Mars; on the 10th, at 7:49 p. m., 2° 21′ north of the\r\nmoon. The 26-inch equatorial of the National Observatory at Washington,\r\nD. C., was during the past year chiefly employed in observations of the\r\nsatellites of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO WIN.\r\n\r\nBY FRANCES E. WILLARD,\r\n\r\nPresident National W. C. T. U.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThus far I have been trying to impress upon you the reasons why you\r\nshould cultivate individuality and independence in word and deed. I\r\nhave claimed that each one of you has a “call” to some specific work,\r\nindicated by God’s gifts to you of brain, or heart, or hand. But I would\r\nnot have you only, or indeed chiefly, concerned with the evolution of\r\nyour powers for your own sake. If you acquire, let it be that you may\r\ndispense; if you achieve, that others may sun themselves in the kind glow\r\nof your prosperity. The people who spend all their strength in absorbing\r\nare failures and parasites. It is alike the business of the sun and of\r\nthe soul to radiate every particle of light that they can muster. There\r\nis reason to believe that this is precisely what they are for. And so,\r\nhaving made sure of your light, strength and discipline, strike out from\r\nthe warm and radiant center of a self-poised brain and heart, into the\r\nlives about you, and you will find that “What is good for the hive is\r\nalso good for the bee.” The luminous characters of history have done\r\nthis, always. Losing their lives in those of other men, they have found\r\nthem in the crest of the world’s gratitude and fame. What they have done\r\non a grand scale, we, from identical motives, may do on a small one.\r\nSuch natures are as different from those who cultivate their strongest\r\ngift simply for their own sake, as a _lighthouse_ is different from a\r\n_dark lantern_. “Self-culture” is much in vogue nowadays, and has for\r\nits high priests some of the most incisive minds of this or any age.\r\nBut self-culture stops in the middle of the sentence I would fain help\r\nyou to utter. It says: “Make the most of your powers;” it does not say\r\n“_for others’ sake_ as well as your own.” It claims that if we set the\r\ncandle of our gifts upon the candlestick of modern society, its light\r\nwill inevitably radiate according to its power of shining, and thus while\r\nbrightening ourselves we shall have done our utmost toward lighting up\r\nthe general gloom. But self-culture forgets that a candle is no type of\r\nyou and me. We are human spirit-lamps, whose rays should be directed and\r\nintensified by the blow-pipe of an unceasing purpose; for we are all so\r\nmade that unless we _will_ to light up other lives, we can never do so to\r\nthe limit of our power. Self-culture is never base; it is often noble,\r\nbut it can never be the noblest aim of all.\r\n\r\nWhy is the memory of Mrs. Browning loved beyond that of almost any\r\npoet who has sung? Because “the cry of the human” is so strong in that\r\nwondrous voice of hers. Why is the name carved deepest on the republic’s\r\nheart that of its martyr President? Because he gave their manhood back\r\nto four millions of slaves, and lived and toiled for his people’s sake,\r\n“with malice toward none, with charity for all.” Why was the lamentation\r\nwell nigh universal when under the sea flashed the telegraphic message,\r\n“John Stuart Mill is dead?” Because this quiet thinker lived for other\r\nmen; because he “struck out from the center,” from himself, that pitiful\r\npivot on which so many human wind-mills turn, and measured, in the swift\r\nflight of its benignant thought, the long radius between him and the\r\nremotest circle of human need; because, more than any other philosopher\r\nof his day, he labored for the time when “all men’s weal shall be each\r\nman’s care.”\r\n\r\nNay, while I mourn, as I have seldom mourned for an historic character,\r\nthe cloud that early dimmed, for Stuart Mill, the Star of Bethlehem, I\r\nwill not, as a woman, withhold from his memory the tribute of my humble\r\ngratitude. But while I speak of all these lives, shining like beacon\r\nlights of our own day, I would not fail to point you in conclusion toward\r\na wide-armed cross upon a lonely hillside, while I repeat his words who\r\nsaid, “And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.” Dear girls,\r\nCHRIST is the magnet of humanity, and she has found the best vocation,\r\nand the highest, who brings most souls diseased within the healing\r\npower of his immortal gospel. This is a work for which women have gifts\r\npreëminent. The Saxon word for lady means “a giver of bread,” and is full\r\nof beautiful significance, but America’s new century shall evolve another\r\nmeaning, freighted with greater blessing for humanity: lady, giver of the\r\nbread of life! In later years we have had a revelation of our duty to\r\nthe ungospeled masses, the “elbow heathen,” as an evangelist has called\r\nthem, to the intemperate (who, as a rule, are quite beyond the hearing\r\nof the pulpit’s voice), and to the dusky dwellers in the Zenana, whose\r\nfaces are misty with the unshed tears of generations passed in misery\r\nand shame. Two thirds of the Church of Christ are women. By the freer\r\nlife and richer opportunity which you and I enjoy; by society’s growing\r\ntolerance, not to say its kindly appreciation, of our activities; by the\r\nheart transformed and the peace imparted through the gospel, the voice of\r\nour Redeemer pleads for our consecrated service. I would not undervalue\r\nthe culture of the intellect, but would exalt the culture of the heart.\r\n\r\nIn all that has been written until now, I have simply tried to outline\r\nthe new horizon opened up to the gentler sex as the supreme outgrowth\r\nof that civilization which He introduced, of whom history records the\r\nsignificant fact that women were “last at his cross, first at his\r\nsepulchre.” To attempt some delineation of the landscape enclosed by\r\nthat far-reaching horizon is my more difficult task in the chapters now\r\nto follow. Many letters have come to me as a result of the articles thus\r\nfar; they bristle with questions and are eloquent with aspiration. Later\r\non I may ask space for a “symposium” with these “inquiring friends” in\r\nthe genial pages of our tolerant CHAUTAUQUAN. One speaking with authority\r\nexhorts me to “Be practical—that’s what we want!” As if I hadn’t been!\r\nBut every mind is the prisoner of its own material and method. I can\r\nbut give of such things as I have; can only tell what life has told to\r\nme. According to my own habits of thought, the sequence seems logical,\r\nwhen I turn for a while from the presentation of the modern outlook for\r\nwomen, with its opportunity and hope, to the _rationale_ of this new\r\nhorizon stretching so far away. Let us note the pathway that has led\r\nup to this more hopeful point of view, asking the inevitable question,\r\n“Why does that seem natural and fitting for a young woman to do and to\r\naspire to now, which would have been no less improper than impossible, a\r\nhundred years ago?” Sweet friends, it is because _the ideal of woman’s\r\nplace in the world is changing in the average mind_. For as the artist’s\r\nideal precedes his picture, so the ideal woman must be transformed\r\nbefore the actual one can be. In an age of brute force, the warrior\r\ngalloping away to his adventures waved his mailed hand to the lady\r\nfair who was enclosed for safe keeping in a grim castle with moat and\r\ndrawbridge. But to-day, when spirit force grows regnant, a woman can\r\ncircumnavigate the globe alone, without danger of an uncivil word, much\r\nless of violence. We shall never span a wider chasm than this change\r\nimplies. All our inventions have led up to it, and have in nothing else\r\nwrought out beneficence so great as they have accomplished here, purely\r\nby indirection. In brief, the barriers that have hedged women into one\r\npathway and men into another, altogether different, are growing thin, as\r\nphysical strength plays a less determining part in our life drama. All\r\nthrough the vegetable and animal kingdoms the fact of sex does not widely\r\ndifferentiate the broader fact of life, its environment and its pursuits.\r\nHence, the immense separateness which sex is called in to explain when\r\nwe reach the plane of humanity, is to be accounted for largely on other\r\npurely artificial grounds. In Eden it did not exist, nor in the original\r\nplan of creation, as stated in these just and fatherly words: “And God\r\nsaid, ‘Let us make man in our own image, after our own likeness. Let\r\nthem have dominion.’ … So God created man in his own image, in the image\r\nof God created he him, male and female created he them, and God blessed\r\nthem, and said unto them, ‘ … replenish the earth and subdue it … and\r\nhave dominion over every living thing.’” After the fall came the curse,\r\nwhich was no part of the original design, and from which the gospel’s\r\ntriumph is releasing us, for there is “neither male nor female in Christ\r\nJesus.” I believe that the origin of evil came in with man’s supremacy\r\nover one who was meant to be his comrade, and that Paradise regained will\r\ncome only when the laureate’s prophecy is realized:\r\n\r\n    “Two heads in council, two beside the hearth,\r\n     Two in the noisy business of the world,\r\n     Two in the liberal offices of life;\r\n     Two plummets dropped to sound the abyss of science\r\n     And the secrets of the mind.”\r\n\r\nThe times when a new ideal is moulded, in church, state, or society, mark\r\nthe epochs of history. Amid what throes did Europe pass from that of\r\nsupreme authority in the church to the incomparably higher one of supreme\r\nliberty in conscience; from the divine right of kings to the divine right\r\nof the people. But there was to come a wider evolution of the same ideal,\r\nnamely, the coequal power of the copartners, man and woman, in working\r\nout the problem of human destiny. This newest and noblest of ideals marks\r\nthe transition from physical force ruling, to spiritual force recognized.\r\nThe gradual adjustment of everyday occupation, custom and law, to this\r\nnew ideal, marks ours as a transition period. Those who have the most\r\nenlargement of opportunity to hope from the change, will, in the nature\r\nof the case, move on most rapidly into the new conditions, and this helps\r\nto explain, I think, why women seem to be climbing more rapidly than\r\nmen, to-day, the heights of spiritual power, with souls more open to the\r\n“skyey influences” of the oncoming age.\r\n\r\nMore women study to-day than men; a greater proportion travel abroad\r\nfor purposes of culture; a larger share are moral and religious. Half\r\nof the world’s wisdom, three fourths of its purity, and nearly all its\r\ngentleness, are to-day to be set down on woman’s credit side. Weighted\r\nwith the alcohol and tobacco habits, Brother Jonathan will have to make\r\nbetter time than he is doing now, if he keeps step with Sister Deborah\r\nacross the threshold of the twentieth century. For the law of survival\r\nof the fittest will inevitably choose that member of the firm who is\r\ncleanliest, most wholesome, most accordant with God’s laws of nature\r\nand of grace, to survive. To the blindness or fatuity which renders him\r\noblivious of the fact that the coming woman is already here, our current\r\nwriter of the W. D. Howells and Henry James school owes the dreary\r\nmonotony of his “society novel.” Not more “conventional” was the style\r\nof art known as “Byzantine,” which repeated with barren iteration its\r\nplacid and colorless “type,” than are the dudesque pages of this pair\r\nof literary martinets. The “American novel” will not be written until\r\nthe American woman, a type now to be found in Michigan, Madison, Boston,\r\nCornell, and other universities, shall have taken her place, twentieth\r\ncentury product that she is, beside the best survivals of young men in\r\nsimilar institutions, and wrought out the Home, the Church, the State\r\nthat are to be. Measuring each other on all planes, these life partners\r\nwill know each other’s value, and no appeal to the divorce court will be\r\nmade to relieve them, a few years after marriage, from an incompatibility\r\nthat has ripened into open war. Happy homes will dot the country from\r\nshore to shore, in which both the man and the woman will do their best to\r\nlift the world toward God.\r\n\r\n“Self-knowledge, self-reverence, and self-control; these three alone lead\r\nlife to a sovereign power,” and these are fast becoming essential to any\r\nideal of womanly character which the modern age will recognize as the\r\nproduct of its institutions. Of self-knowledge, these talks have said\r\nmuch. Self-reverence I would fain help you to develop in your character\r\nas a woman. If my dear mother did me one crowning kindness it was in\r\nmaking me believe that next to being an angel, the greatest bestowment\r\nof God is to make one a woman. With what contempt she referred to the\r\nold Jewish formula in which the less refined sex rolled out the words,\r\n“I thank thee, O God, that thou hast not made me a woman,” and with what\r\npathos she repeated the gentle prayer of the other, “I thank thee, O God,\r\nthat thou hast made me as it pleased thee,” with the pithy comment, “What\r\ncould have pleased Him better, I should like to know, than to make one\r\nso rare, so choice, so spiritual as woman is?” Perhaps some of you may\r\nhave thought you wanted to be a boy, but I seriously doubt it. You may\r\nhave wanted a boy’s freedom, his independence, his healthful, unimpeding\r\nstyle of dress, but I do not believe any true girl could ever have been\r\ncoaxed to be a boy. Reverence yourself, then, if you would learn one of\r\nthe first elements of “How to Win” in this great world race, with its\r\n“go-as-you-please” terms, but its “Lucifer-may-take-the-hindmost” penalty\r\nfor failure.\r\n\r\nWhat will the new ideal of woman _not_ be? She will never be written\r\ndown in the hotel register by her husband after this fashion: “John\r\nSmith and Wife.” He would as soon think of her writing “Mrs. John Smith\r\nand Husband.” Why does it not occur to any one to designate him thus?\r\nSimply because he is so much more than that. He is a leading force in\r\nthe affairs of the church; he helps decide who shall be pastor. (So will\r\nshe.) He is perhaps the village physician, or merchant (so she will be,\r\nperhaps—indeed, they are oftentimes in partnership, nowadays, and I\r\nhave found their home a blessed one). He is the village editor. (Very\r\nlikely she will be associate.) He is a voter. (She will be, beyond a\r\nperadventure.) For the same reason you will never read of her marriage\r\nthat “the minister pronounced them _man_ and _wife_” for that functionary\r\nwould have been just as likely to pronounce them “husband and woman,” a\r\nform of expression into which the regulation reporter will be likely to\r\nfall one of these days, it being, really, not one whit more ridiculous\r\nthan the time-worn phrase, “man and wife.” The ideal woman of the future\r\nwill never be designated as “the Widow Jones,” because she will be so\r\nmuch more than that—“a provider” for her children, “a power” in the\r\nchurch, “a felt force” in the state. I think George Eliot is the first\r\nwoman to attain the post-mortem honor of having her husband called “her\r\nwidower,” John W. Cross having been thus indicated in English papers of\r\nthe period. A turn about is fair play, and the phrase is really quite\r\nrefreshing to one’s sense of justice. The ideal woman will not write upon\r\nher visiting card, nor insist on having her letters addressed, to Mrs.\r\nJohn Smith, or Mrs. Gen. Smith, as the case may be, but will, if her\r\nmaiden name was Jones, fling her banner to the breeze as “Mrs. Mary Jones\r\nSmith,” and will be sure to make it honorable. She will not be the lay\r\nfigure made and provided to illustrate the fashions of Monsieur Worth and\r\nlesser lights of the same guild, but will insist that the goddess Hygiea\r\nis the only true modiste, and will dutifully obey her orders. As the\r\nLouvre gallery proves that when men were but the parasites of the court\r\nthey too decked themselves with ear-rings, high heels, powdered hair and\r\ngaudy garments, so the distorted figures in the detestable fashion plates\r\nof to-day are the irrefutable proofs of woman’s fractional estate; but\r\nthis will not be so to-morrow, when she finds her kingdom—which is her\r\nown true self. The ideal woman will cease to heed the cruel “Thus far and\r\nno farther,” which has issued from the pinched lips of old Dame Custom,\r\nchecking her ardent steps throughout all the ages past, and will be\r\nstudious only to hear the kindly “Thus far and no farther” of God.\r\n\r\nThe ideal woman will play Beatrice to man’s Dante in the Inferno of his\r\npassions. She will give him the clue out of materialism’s Labyrinth. She\r\nwill be civilization’s Una, taming the Lion of disease and misery. The\r\nState shall no longer go limping on one foot through the years, but shall\r\nmarch off with steps firm and equipoised. The keen eye and deft hand of\r\nthe housekeeper shall help to make its everyday walks wholesome; the\r\nskill in detail, trustworthiness in finance, motherliness in sympathy,\r\nso long extolled in private life, shall exalt public station. Indeed,\r\nif I were asked the mission of the ideal woman, I would reply: IT IS TO\r\nMAKE THE WHOLE WORLD HOMELIKE. Some one has said that “Temperament is\r\nthe climate of the individual,” but home is woman’s climate, her vital\r\nbreath, her native air. A true woman carries home with her everywhere.\r\nIts atmosphere surrounds her; its mirror is her face; its music attunes\r\nher gentle voice; its longitude may be reckoned from wherever you happen\r\nto find her. But\r\n\r\n    “Home’s not merely four square walls.”\r\n\r\nSome people once thought it was, and they thought, also, that you might\r\nas well throw down its Lares and Penates as to carry away its weaving\r\nloom and spinning wheel. But it survived this spoliation; and when\r\nwomen ceased to pick their own geese and do their own dyeing, it still\r\nserenely smiled. The sewing machine took away much of its occupation;\r\nthe French and Chinese laundries have intruded upon its domain; indeed,\r\nmen, by their “witty inventions,” are perpetually encroaching on “woman’s\r\nsphere,” so that the next generation will no doubt turn the cook stove\r\nout of doors, and the housekeeper, standing at the telephone, will\r\norder better cooked meals than almost any one has nowadays, sent from\r\nscientific caterers by pneumatic tubes, and the debris thereof returned\r\nto a general cleaning-up establishment; while houses will be heated, as\r\nthey are now lighted and supplied with water, from general reservoirs.\r\n\r\nWomen are fortunate in belonging to the less tainted half of the race.\r\nDr. Benjamin Ward Richardson says that but for this conserving fact it\r\nwould deteriorate to the point of failure. A bright old lady said, after\r\nviewing a brewery, distillery and tobacco factory: “Ain’t I thankful that\r\nthe women folks hain’t got all that stuff to chew and smoke and swallow\r\ndown!” It behooves us to offset force of muscle by force of heart, that\r\nwhat our strong brothers have done to subdue the material world for us,\r\nwho are not their equals in physical strength, may be offset by what we\r\nshall achieve for them in bringing in the reign of “Sweeter manners,\r\npurer laws.” For the world is slowly making the immense discovery that\r\nnot what woman does, but what she is, makes home a possible creation.\r\nIt is the Lord’s ark, and does not need steadying; it will survive the\r\nwreck of systems and the crash of theories, for the home is but the\r\nefflorescence of woman’s nature under the nurture of Christ’s gospel. She\r\ncame into the college and elevated it, into literature and hallowed it,\r\ninto the business world and ennobled it. She will come into government\r\nand purify it, into politics and cleanse that Stygian pool as the\r\nwaters of Marah were cleansed; for woman will make homelike every place\r\nshe enters, and she will enter every place on this round earth. Any\r\ncustom, or traffic, or party, on which a woman can not look with favor\r\nis irrevocably doomed. Its welcome of her presence and her power is to\r\nbe the final test of its fitness to survive. All Gospel civilization is\r\nradiant with the demonstration of this truth:\r\n\r\n    “It is not good for man to be alone.”\r\n\r\nThe most vivid object lesson on history’s page is the fact that his\r\ndeterioration is in exact proportion to his isolation from the home of\r\nwoman’s pure companionship. To my own grateful thought, the most sacred\r\nsignificance of woman’s work to-day lies in the fact that she occupies\r\nthe outer circle in this tremendous evolution of the Christian idea of\r\nhome. Ours is a high and sacred calling. Out of pure hearts, fervently\r\nlet us love God and humanity; so shall we be Christ’s disciples, and so\r\nshall we safely follow on to know the work whereunto we have been called.\r\n\r\n    “’Tis home where’er the heart is,”\r\n\r\nand no true mother, sister, daughter or wife, can fail to go in spirit\r\nafter her beloved and tempted ones, as their adventurous steps enter the\r\nlabyrinth of the world’s temptations. We can not call them back.\r\n\r\n    “All before them lies the way.”\r\n\r\nThere is but one remedy; we must bring the home to them, for they will\r\nnot return to it. Still must their mothers walk beside them, sweet and\r\nserious, and clad in the garments of power. The occupations, pleasures\r\nand ambitions of men and women must not diverge so widely from each\r\nother. Potent beyond all other facts of everyday experience is the\r\nrapidly increasing similarity between the pursuits of these two factions\r\nthat make up the human integer. When brute force reigned, this rapport\r\nwas at zero. “Impediments to the rear,” was the command of Cæsar and the\r\nrule of every warrior—women and children being the hindrances referred\r\nto. But to-day there is not a motto more popular than that of the\r\ninspired old German, “Come, let us live for our children;” and as for\r\nwomen, “the world is all before them where to choose.”\r\n\r\nNo greater good can come to the manhood of the world than is prophesied\r\nin the increasing community of thought and works between it and the\r\nworld’s womanhood. The growing individuality, independence and prestige\r\nof the gentler sex steadily require from the stronger a higher standard\r\nof character and purer habits of life. This blessed consummation, so\r\ndevoutly to be wished, is hastened, dear girlish hearts, by every prayer\r\nyou offer, by every hymn you sing, by every loving errand of your willing\r\nfeet and gentle hands. You are the true friends of tempted manhood,\r\nbewildered youth and every little child. The steadfast faith and loyal,\r\npatient work you are to do, will be the mightiest factor in woman’s\r\ncontribution to the solution of this Republic’s greatest problem, and\r\nwill have their final significance in the thought and purpose, not that\r\nthe world shall come into the home, but that the home, embodied and\r\nimpersonated in its womanhood, shall go forth into the world.\r\n\r\nI have no fears for the women of America. They will never content\r\nthemselves remaining stationary in methods or in policy, much less sound\r\na retreat in their splendid warfare against the saloon in law and in\r\npolitics. The tides of the mother’s heart do not change; we can count\r\nupon them always. The voice of Miriam still cheers the brave advance, and\r\nall along the line we hear the battle cry: “Speak unto the children of\r\nIsrael, that they go forward.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATLIN PAINTINGS.\r\n\r\nBY O. T. MASON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you will enter the National Museum at Washington, and give your cane\r\nor umbrella to the venerable gentleman at the stand, you will see some\r\nwonderful old pictures. Turn abruptly to your right, cast a patriotic\r\nglance at the clothing and camp furniture of the Father of his Country,\r\nand a few steps will bring you into the museum lecture room, whose east,\r\nsouth, and west walls are covered with quaint sketches of American\r\naboriginal life, mounted in the dingiest possible black frames. This is\r\nthe Catlin Collection, by far the most celebrated Indian paintings in the\r\nworld, since the dreadful fire in the Smithsonian Institution burned up\r\nthe Stanley portraits in 1864. A few words about this wonderful painter\r\nwould certainly interest you before you begin to look at his pictures.\r\n\r\nGeorge Catlin was born in Wilkesbarre, Luzerne county, Pennsylvania,\r\nin 1796. His father was a lawyer, and, naturally, took every pains to\r\neducate his son for that profession, sending him at last to Yale College\r\nto finish his course. But that which has often happened to boys was\r\ntrue in George’s case—he loved fishing and painting more than he loved\r\nthe bar. His law practice lasted two years, after which he established\r\nhimself in New York and Philadelphia as a portrait painter. In the year\r\n1832 he saw a delegation of Indians from St. Louis, a town of 25,000\r\ninhabitants, then headquarters for the Central Superintendency (see\r\npainting 311), and was so overwhelmed by their appearance that nothing\r\ncould overcome his desire to visit them in their homes. Convinced\r\nthat the noble savage would rapidly decline before the advance of\r\ncivilization, and realizing as if by inspiration the value which a\r\npictorial history of the dying race would possess to future students of\r\nprimitive history, he set out alone for St. Louis, with pen and brush,\r\nto accomplish this noble design. Here he became acquainted with Mr.\r\nChouteau, a gentleman thoroughly conversant with the Indian country and\r\ncharacter, who secured for the painter a free ride to the mouth of the\r\nYellowstone in a little, rude steamer called the “Yellowstone.”\r\n\r\nHe devoted eight years, from 1832 to 1840, to his enterprise, visiting\r\nforty-eight tribes of Indians residing within British America, the United\r\nStates and Mexico. Speaking of these years in after life he says: “I\r\nhave seen them in their own villages, have carried my canvas and colors\r\nthe whole way, and painted my portraits from life as they now stand in\r\nthe gallery. Some of them have been taken while I have been paddling my\r\ncanoe, or leading my pack-horse through trackless wilds, even at the\r\nhazard of my life.”\r\n\r\nOn his return to the East from this remarkable Odyssey, Mr. Catlin\r\nexhibited his sketches, together with such a collection of weapons,\r\ndress, ornaments and implements as it will never be possible to procure\r\nagain, in Philadelphia, New York and Boston, to great crowds of visitors.\r\nThe papers were filled with praises respecting it. The _United States\r\nGazette_ says: “There can be no mistake or exaggeration in pronouncing\r\nthe exhibition of these views of the scenery and natural history of the\r\nwestern country the most important and interesting object for public\r\nattention which has ever been offered to the eastern division of the\r\nUnited States.”\r\n\r\nMany of Mr. Catlin’s friends were anxious for the government or some well\r\nfounded institution to buy the collection, but nothing was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Mr. Catlin took his pictures abroad, prospects having been held\r\nout to him of getting a handsome price for them. The Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer admitted the packages free of duty, and the whole was set up in\r\na room 106 feet long, in Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London.\r\n\r\nNumerous assemblages, comprising many of the distinguished members of\r\nthe fashionable and the literary world visited the entertainments and\r\nlistened to the lectures of Mr. Catlin.\r\n\r\nIt is just a little to be feared that the painter added to the genius of\r\nthe artist a modicum of the showman’s vanity, in support of which theory\r\nthe following is quoted from the London _Morning Post_: “This valuable\r\ncollection of portraits, landscapes, scenes from savage life, weapons,\r\ncostumes, and an endless variety of illustrations of Indian life, real\r\nas well as pictorial, continues to attract crowds of spectators. We are\r\nhappy to find our prediction fully borne out by fact, that the exhibition\r\nonly required to be made known to the public to be fully appreciated.\r\nThe most pleasing attention is paid by Mr. Catlin and his assistants to\r\ngratify the curiosity of visitors, to point out the peculiarities of the\r\nvarious subjects through which they wander, and to explain everything\r\nwhich strikes the eye and attracts the observer to inquire into its use\r\nor meaning. During our visit on Saturday the company were startled by\r\na yell, and shortly afterward by the appearance of a stately chief of\r\nthe Crow Indians stalking silently through the hall, armed to the teeth\r\nand painted to the temples, wrapped in a buffalo robe, on which all his\r\nbattles were depicted, and wearing a tasteful coronet of war eagle’s\r\nquills. This personation was volunteered by a nephew of Mr. Catlin, who\r\nhas seen the red man in his native wilds, and presents the most proud\r\nand picturesque similitude of the savage warrior that can be conceived.\r\nHis war-whoop, his warlike appearance and dignified movements seem to\r\nimpress the assemblage more strikingly with a feeling of the character\r\nof the North American Indian than all the other evidences which crowded\r\nthe walls. Subsequently he appeared in another splendid costume worn\r\nby the braves of the Mandan tribe, also remarkable for its costly and\r\nmagnificent head-dress, in which we see the ‘horns of power’ assume a\r\nconspicuous place. The crowds that gathered around him on each occasion\r\nwere so dense that Mr. Catlin could scarcely find space to explain in\r\nfull detail all the costumes; but we are glad to find he is preparing a\r\ncentral stage where all may enjoy a full and fair sight of ‘the Red Man,’\r\nas he issues from his wigwam, clad in the peculiar robes and ornaments of\r\nhis tribe, to fight, hunt, smoke, or join in the dances, festivals, and\r\namusements of each nation.”\r\n\r\nThis, of course, smacks a little of Buffalo Bill, but it pleased the\r\nEuropeans amazingly. Mr. Catlin gave exhibitions in Waterloo rooms,\r\nEdinburgh; in the Louvre, at Paris, where Louis Philippe gave him ample\r\nspace; and in many other European cities, occupying in all about eight\r\nyears. During this time he published “Manners and Customs,” etc.; “The\r\nNorth American Portfolio;” “Eight Years’ Travels.” In 1861 he published a\r\nlittle work on “The Breath of Life,” certainly the funniest serious book\r\nwe have ever read. In 1862 appeared “Last Rambles Among the Indians,” etc.\r\n\r\nAs many other people have done concerning their own handiwork, Mr.\r\nCatlin overestimated the intrinsic value of his paintings and specimens,\r\nand made the mistake of thinking that everybody would surely be as\r\nenthusiastic as himself. The British government did not buy the\r\ngallery. Even the platform and Mr. Catlin’s nephew could not save the\r\nship. In Belgium financial embarrassment overtook the painter and his\r\nworks. The whole material was likely to go under the hammer, when Mr.\r\nThomas Harrison, a wealthy Philadelphian, advanced the money and took\r\nthe collection as security, with the understanding that it could be\r\nredeemed. This proving beyond Mr. Catlin’s means, all of the paintings\r\nand specimens were transferred to Philadelphia and stored until Mr.\r\nHarrison’s death, when his widow presented the entire gallery to the\r\nNational Museum, together with such dresses, etc., as time and moths had\r\nspared.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have heard that the Washington pictures are not the\r\noriginals. The facts are these: After transferring his material in\r\nBelgium to Mr. Harrison, Mr. Catlin traveled throughout North America,\r\nand even in South America, making aboriginal sketches. This second\r\ncollection was exhibited for a time in the west corridor of the\r\nSmithsonian. On his death, in 1872, the pictures were packed up and\r\nstored in the Smithsonian building until 1876, when they were transferred\r\nto the Philadelphia Exposition. They are now to be seen in the permanent\r\nexhibition there.\r\n\r\nNow for the pictures. A great American ethnologist says “Catlin is the\r\ngreat American Indian liar;” another, quite as eminent, says that when he\r\nshowed one of these pictures to a Sioux Indian, the latter was affected\r\nto tears at the recognition of a dear friend long deceased. Both were\r\nright. Recently M. Achille Collin, a French sculptor, was employed\r\nto produce several busts of celebrated Indians, from photographs and\r\nportraits, for the New Orleans Exposition. Among them was Osceola,\r\nwhose portrait is in the Catlin gallery. Fortunately, the Museum has\r\nalso Osceola’s death mask. M. Collin found that Catlin had placed the\r\neyes too far apart, and had perpetrated several other little artistic\r\noutrages, yet the sculptor was able to rectify these and to produce a\r\nwonderful bust of the wily Seminole. In one sense everything is wrong in\r\nthese paintings, in another sense they are teeming with life and spirit.\r\nA French critic said in the Paris _Constitutionnel_: “A professional\r\npainter is perfectly lost in the presence of a nature new to him, in such\r\nsingular lands, such original colors of sky, foliage and men.” You must\r\nknow a language in order to appreciate its beauties, you must know Indian\r\nlife to appreciate Catlin. His images do not pose, they fly across the\r\ncanvas. M. Schindler, whose lifelike portraiture of fishes has given him\r\na world-wide reputation, and who has lived among the Sioux and painted\r\nthem, has the same admiration of these savage portraitures, whose shadowy\r\nlooks are ominous of their fast fading originals. A workman in the Museum\r\nwhose business it is to arrange Indian costumes says that in those things\r\nwhich anybody can do, Catlin was careless; but in the arrangement of\r\ndress, ornaments and weapons, which nobody now knows how to fix, he is an\r\ninvaluable guide. It may not be known to all that the numberless tribes\r\nformerly living within our domain belonged to a few well defined stocks,\r\nrecognizable by language, institutions, and customs. East of the Rocky\r\nMountains, where most of these pictures were painted, were the Athapascan\r\nof the north, the Algonquin and Iroquois of the east, the Cherokee and\r\nMuskokee of the south, and the Dakotan of the west. In the great interior\r\nbasin were the Shoshones, and west of the Sierras the Flatheads, Chinuks,\r\nand many other little known stocks.\r\n\r\nThe Algonkin stock is represented in Mr. Catlin’s gallery by portraits\r\nand groups of Sacs and Foxes, Sheyennes, Blackfeet, Chippewas and\r\nOttawas, Crees, Menomonees, Pottawatomies, Kickapoos, Kaskaskias, Weeahs,\r\nPeorias, Piankeshaws, Mohegans, Delawares and Shawnees.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated league of the Iroquois by representatives from the\r\nfollowing tribes looks down upon us as Oneidas, Tuscaroras and Senecas.\r\n\r\nJohn Ross, a civilized and well educated chief, with four other\r\ncelebrated faces, represents the Cherokee stock. The great Muskogee or\r\nCreek confederacy includes paintings of distinguished Creeks, Choktas,\r\nSeminoles, and Yuchees. Most of the last two stocks were well instructed\r\nby Protestant missionaries, previously to their transfer into the Indian\r\nTerritory. It is this fact alone which explains their steady increase\r\nwhile so many other tribes have melted away. It was among the Dakotas,\r\nhowever, that Catlin’s enthusiasm first took fire and increased most\r\nfervently. In addition to the many landscape and hunting pictures, whose\r\nscenes are laid in this romantic country, you will see staring at you\r\nfrom these dingy frames, men and women of many Dakotan tribes, Kansas,\r\nOsages, Ponkas, Omahas, Otoes, Missourias, Iowas, Mandans, Blackfeet\r\nSioux, Crows, Assiniboins, Winnebagos, and Sioux proper. A few Comanches,\r\nPawnee Picts, Weecos, Pawnees and Arikarees, Flatheads and Chinuks\r\ncomplete the list.\r\n\r\nOf all the tribes visited by Mr. Catlin, the Mandans awaken the most\r\nlively interest, not only by their impressive ceremonies, but because the\r\nwhole tribe were extinguished by smallpox and suicide in 1837, excepting\r\nabout forty who afterward fell victims to their enemies.\r\n\r\nLook along on the wall until you find the pictures numbered 504, 505,\r\n506 and 507. In these, by a series of tableaux, the painter presents\r\nto us the annual ceremony of initiation, called the Sun dance by the\r\nmodern Dakotas, and witnessed two years ago by Miss Alice Fletcher. This\r\nceremony continues four days and nights in succession, in commemoration\r\nof the subsiding of the flood, and also for the purpose of conducting\r\nall the young men, as they arrive at manhood, through an ordeal of\r\nvoluntary torture, which when endured entitles them to the respect of\r\nthe chiefs, to the privileges of going on war-parties, and of taking\r\na wife. The floor and sides of the medicine lodge are ornamented with\r\ngreen willow boughs. The young men who are to do penance by torture lie\r\nalong the sides of the lodge, their bodies covered with clay of different\r\ncolors, their respective shields and weapons hanging over their heads.\r\nIn the middle of the lodge the medicine man prays to the Great Spirit\r\nand watches the young men through their four days’ fast, preparatory to\r\nthe torture. Near the medicine man lies a scalping knife, and a bunch\r\nof splints which are to be passed through the flesh of the novitiates\r\nlike belaying pins. The Buffalo dance takes place several times each day\r\noutside the lodge in which the young men lie. The principal actors in\r\nthis dance are eight men with the skins of buffaloes around them and a\r\nbunch of green willows on their backs. The evil spirit, Okeehedee, enters\r\nthe village from the prairie, alarming the women, who cry for assistance\r\nand are relieved by the old medicine man. Okeehedee is at length disarmed\r\nof his lance, which is broken by the women, and he is driven by them in\r\ndisgrace out of the village. On the fourth day of the festival the young\r\nmen are subjected to the torture, which in many forms amounts essentially\r\nto this: Two gashes, parallel and near together, are cut quite through\r\nthe skin, either on the breast, back or arms, looking for all the world\r\nlike those on the sides of a sheep dressed for market. A wooden pin is\r\nthrust from gash to gash, under the intervening strip of skin. One end\r\nof a long and strong rawhide line is wrapped or belayed around this peg\r\nsecurely. Now comes the tug of war, the problem always being either to\r\ntear this peg out by breaking the strip of flesh or to see how much\r\npain the sufferer can stand. He is hauled up to the roof of the lodge,\r\nsuspended from an elastic sapling, or dragged around the camp; finally\r\nhaving fastened the end of the line farthest from him to a post, he tugs\r\naway with might and main until his flesh is torn loose.\r\n\r\nTurn now away from this dreadful scene and take a look at the funny side\r\nof Indian life. Here is a fellow whose eager haste after a buffalo ends\r\nin being thrown on the monster’s back and taking a bison ride over the\r\nprairie. There the clans contend nip and tuck for mastery in the ball\r\nplay. On this canvas a celebrated archer is showing how many arrows he\r\ncan shoot before the first one falls. Perhaps your delicate sensibility\r\nwill not enjoy the dog dance, where the Sioux braves are dancing up\r\ngrotesquely and biting off pieces of a heart taken raw and bleeding\r\nfrom a dog. Well, here is a sham battle of Mandan boys, their school of\r\npractice every morning at sunrise, and just there a prairie-dog village.\r\nThis picture, No. 337, is the celebrated Pipestone quarry on the Couteau\r\ndes Prairies, 300 miles northwest of the Falls of St. Anthony, on the\r\ndivide between the St. Peters and the Missouri. Here is where from time\r\nimmemorial the Indians have obtained for making pipes that beautiful red\r\nsteatite, which the mineralogists now call _catlinite_, after our hero.\r\nThere are many more just as strange and interesting stories hanging about\r\nthis dear old Smithsonian, and some day THE CHAUTAUQUAN may let you into\r\nthe secret. You notice here and there that the fatal pointer has gone\r\nquite through the noble brave, and that accounts for solicitude about\r\nyour cane and umbrella at the beginning. You will find them at the door,\r\nand don’t fail to reclaim them with your check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE BANCROFT.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. W. W. GIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft is the Nestor of American men of letters. Born October\r\n3, 1800, he received his early training at Exeter Academy, and graduated\r\nat Harvard in 1817. He is now eighty-four years old, and his life\r\nhas touched every administration in the history of our nation except\r\nWashington’s. What mighty changes have been wrought in the land since\r\nGeorge Bancroft, a manly youth, stepped forth from his _alma mater_ a\r\nfull-fledged graduate! Two generations have passed away and a third\r\nis now on the stage of action. Webster, Clay, Calhoun and Benton had\r\nnot yet reached the zenith of their power. These men have passed\r\naway, and another group, equally great, of whom Abraham Lincoln was\r\nthe central figure, became conspicuous leaders in the most thrilling\r\nperiod of our history, and have passed away likewise. Indeed, there are\r\nthousands of voters to-day who were born during the exciting events of\r\nLincoln’s administration. At the time George Bancroft graduated which,\r\nin the general acceptation of the term, marked the commencement of his\r\nlife’s work, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Blaine, Cleveland, and\r\nGenerals Sherman and Sheridan had not been born. Some of these have won\r\nnever-fading honors in events that have attracted the attention of the\r\nwhole world, and are numbered among our heroes. At that time Harvard was\r\na very different institution from what it is now; American literature was\r\nin its infancy; Washington Irving had scarcely gained a recognition on\r\nthe other side of the waters.\r\n\r\nForty-five years ago Bancroft held a government office and secured for\r\nNathaniel Hawthorne an appointment in the Boston Custom House. Hawthorne\r\nwas then a literary man with some reputation, but his pen did not afford\r\nhim a livelihood. His great masterpieces were written during the next\r\nquarter of a century, and twenty years have passed since the announcement\r\nof his death cast a gloom over the literary world, while his friend and\r\nbenefactor still survives in the full vigor of his intellectual powers.\r\n\r\nMacaulay and Bancroft were born in the same year; the former has been\r\ndead nearly twenty-five years; the latter is giving finishing touches to\r\nhis great history, which merits a place with Macaulay’s and Gibbon’s.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft’s father was the Rev. Aaron Bancroft, D.D., who as a\r\nyoung man participated in the battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill, and\r\nwho in later years won an honorable name as a theologian and man of\r\nletters, his “Life of Washington” attracting considerable attention in\r\nEurope. The son inherited many of the admirable characteristics of the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nAfter his graduation at Harvard, George Bancroft spent five years in\r\nEurope, receiving a degree from the University of Göttingen, mastering\r\nthe principal modern languages, giving special attention to the study of\r\nhistory, visiting the most important nations of the continent, and above\r\nall communing with some of the greatest minds of the age. It was his rare\r\nprivilege to meet, and to enjoy the friendship of, such men as Wolf, the\r\ndistinguished classic scholar, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Goethe, Cousin,\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, Chevalier Bunsen, Niebuhr, and others scarcely\r\nless distinguished.\r\n\r\nReturning to his native land in 1822, he spent one year as tutor of Greek\r\nin Harvard, and afterward assisted in establishing a preparatory school\r\nat Northampton. The subject of United States history already absorbed his\r\nmind, and the next few years were spent in special study for his great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBancroft has held a number of offices. In 1838 President Van Buren\r\nappointed him collector at the port of Boston, and he discharged the\r\nduties of the office with marked ability. In 1845 he entered President\r\nPolk’s cabinet as Secretary of the Navy. A number of important events\r\nof this administration are linked with his name. Through his influence\r\nthe naval academy at Annapolis was established, and he introduced many\r\nneeded reforms into the naval service. He ordered the United States fleet\r\nto assist Captain Fremont in taking possession of California, and as\r\nActing Secretary of War he issued orders for the United States army to\r\nmarch into Texas at the commencement of the Mexican war. In 1846 he was\r\nappointed minister to England, and held the position for three years.\r\nWhile in England unusual courtesies were extended to him, and every\r\nfacility was granted for carrying on his historical researches, official\r\nstate papers and many valuable private libraries being accessible. He\r\nalso visited Paris for the purpose of study, and received valuable\r\nassistance from Guizot and Lamartine. In 1867 he was appointed minister\r\nto Berlin and remained abroad a number of years, calling forth a special\r\ncommendation from President Grant for his wise diplomatic services.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft has done considerable literary work in addition to writing\r\nhis “History of the United States.” When a young man he published a\r\nvolume of poems; he has contributed a great many articles to magazines,\r\nand has delivered a number of memorial addresses on prominent Americans.\r\nIn 1859 he prepared a paper on “Prescott” for the New York Historical\r\nSociety; also one on “Washington Irving.” In 1860 he delivered an address\r\nin Cleveland at the unveiling of the statue of Commodore Oliver H. Perry,\r\nand February 12, 1866, he delivered before the two houses of Congress a\r\nmemorial address on President Lincoln.\r\n\r\nBancroft is known most widely, however, as an historian, and his noble\r\nhistory is a monument more durable than granite. He brought to his task\r\na mind philosophic in character, broad in grasp, impartial in judgment,\r\nbelieving firmly in God’s superintending care, rich in scholarship, and\r\nwith enough of the imaginative and poetical to quicken and vivify all his\r\nintellectual powers. He has bestowed nearly sixty years of conscientious\r\nlabor on this great historical work, the first volume of which appeared\r\nin 1834, fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe historian requires peculiar talent for his work. He must have such\r\npatience and energy as will enable him to carry on any research that\r\nwill throw light on the subject he is investigating; he must weigh all\r\nevidence as coolly as the most unprejudiced judge; he must not assume\r\nthe part of an advocate until he has examined the subject from every\r\nstandpoint and reached an unbiased conclusion; he must grasp the real\r\nideas and principles that underlie the events and are hastening the\r\nprogress of civilization; he must have sufficient imagination to see the\r\nevents as real, and to make his readers see them as such; in addition, he\r\nmust have a copiousness of illustration and a fluency of language that\r\nwill enable him to present his subject in an attractive form. In short,\r\nhe must be a scholar, an explorer, a philosopher, and a rhetorician. Few,\r\nif any, have possessed all these qualifications in a preëminent degree;\r\nBancroft certainly possesses them all in no small degree.\r\n\r\nGibbon will doubtless ever hold an honorable place as an historical\r\nwriter; and yet he attempts to account for the rapid spread of\r\nChristianity entirely on human grounds, and refuses to recognize the\r\ngreatest force then at work in effecting changes among the nations of\r\nthe world. Macaulay well says of Gibbon: “He writes like a man who had\r\nreceived some personal injury from Christianity and wished to be revenged\r\non it and all its possessors.” No such charge can be made against George\r\nBancroft. He is a firm believer in God, recognizes Christianity as the\r\nmost powerful factor in the progress of civilization, and continually\r\nevinces his unfaltering belief in God’s superintending care over human\r\naffairs. The opening paragraph of his address on President Lincoln may be\r\ntaken as his creed on God in history. Notice how clear his statement and\r\ntriumphant his faith:\r\n\r\n“That God rules in the affairs of men is as certain as any truth of\r\nphysical science. On the great moving power which is from the beginning\r\nhangs the world of the senses and the world of thought and action.\r\nEternal wisdom marshals the great procession of the nations, working in\r\npatient continuity through the ages, never halting and never abrupt,\r\nencompassing all events in its oversight, and ever effecting its will,\r\nthough mortals may slumber in apathy or oppose with madness. Kings are\r\nlifted up or thrown down, nations come and go, republics flourish and\r\nwither, dynasties pass away as a tale that is told; but nothing is by\r\nchance, though men, in their ignorance of causes, may think so. The deeds\r\nof time are governed, as well as judged, by the decrees of eternity.”\r\n\r\nA quotation from his history will show his estimate of Christianity:\r\n\r\n“To have asserted clearly the unity of mankind was the distinctive\r\ncharacter of the Christian religion. No more were the nations to be\r\nsevered by the worship of exclusive deities. The world was instructed\r\nthat all men are of one blood; that for all there is but one divine\r\nnature and but one moral law; and the renovating faith taught the\r\nsingleness of the race, of which it embodied the aspirations and guided\r\nthe advancement.”[E]\r\n\r\nNotice also this noble tribute to Christianity in his history:\r\n\r\n“The colonists, including their philosophy in their religion, as the\r\npeople up to that time had always done, were neither skeptics nor\r\nsensualists, but Christians. The school that bows to the senses as the\r\nsole interpreter of truth had little share in colonizing our America. The\r\ncolonists from Maine to Carolina, the adventurous companions of Smith,\r\nthe proscribed Puritans that freighted the fleet of Winthrop, the Quaker\r\noutlaws that fled from jails with a Newgate prisoner as the sovereign—all\r\nhad faith in God and in the soul. The system which had been revealed\r\nin Judea—the system which combines and perfects the symbolic wisdom of\r\nthe Orient and the reflective genius of Greece—the system, conforming\r\nto reason, yet kindling enthusiasm; always hastening reform, yet always\r\nconservative; proclaiming absolute equality among men, yet not suddenly\r\nabolishing the unequal institutions of society; guaranteeing absolute\r\nfreedom, yet invoking the inexorable restrictions of duty; in the highest\r\ndegree theoretical, yet in the highest degree practical; awakening the\r\ninner man to a consciousness of his destiny, and yet adapted with exact\r\nharmony to the outward world; at once divine and human—this system was\r\nprofessed in every part of our widely extended country, and cradled\r\nour freedom. Our fathers were not only Christians; they were, even in\r\nMaryland by a vast majority, elsewhere almost unanimously, protestants.\r\nNow the Protestant Reformation, considered in its largest influence on\r\npolitics, was the awakening of the common people to freedom of mind.”[F]\r\n\r\nIn a recent private letter to Dr. Buckley, of the _Christian Advocate_,\r\nBancroft uses these words quoted in that paper:\r\n\r\n“Certainly our great united commonwealth is the child of Christianity;\r\nit may with equal truth be asserted that modern civilization sprung into\r\nlife with our religion; and faith in its principles is the life-boat on\r\nwhich humanity has at divers times escaped the most threatening perils.”\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n“The principles that govern human affairs, extending like a path of\r\nlight from century to century, become the highest demonstration of the\r\nsuperintending providence of God.”[G]\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary to multiply quotations illustrative of his faith\r\nin the Deity. Throughout the whole of his writings he manifests a devout,\r\nreverential state of mind, and keeps constantly before the reader the\r\nidea that God is the great power back of those mighty movements that stir\r\nthe nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe philosophic cast of his mind is clearly revealed in all his\r\ndiscussions of causes and results. He firmly believes that “the problems\r\nof politics can not be solved without passing behind transient forms to\r\nefficient causes,” and he ever seeks to find the real origin of an event.\r\nHe dates the American Revolution back to the Reformation under Luther\r\nand Calvin, and in relating the events that led to a separation from\r\nthe mother country he discusses with great clearness and elaborateness\r\nthree points essential to the proper understanding of the subject: In the\r\nfirst place he speaks of the emancipation of the mind at the Reformation,\r\nand the consequent birth of the idea of freedom. In the second place he\r\ndiscusses the growth of this idea of freedom in the nations of Europe\r\nand on this continent. In the third place he describes with wonderful\r\nfairness the violent discussions that arose in England and in this\r\ncountry when the colonists raised a protest against the tyrannies of the\r\nmother country. Referring to the origin of our present liberty, he says\r\nexplicitly:\r\n\r\n“The Reformation was an expression of the right of the human intellect to\r\nfreedom.”[H]\r\n\r\nHe thus speaks of the influence of Luther and the Reformation: “At his\r\nbidding truth leaped over the cloister walls and challenged every man\r\nto make her his guest; aroused every intelligence to acts of private\r\njudgment, changed a dependent, recipient people into a reflecting,\r\ninquiring people; lifted each human being out of the castes of the middle\r\nage, to endow him with individuality, and summoned man to stand forth as\r\nman. The world heaved with the fervent conflict of opinion. The people\r\nand their guides recognized the dignity of labor; the oppressed peasantry\r\ntook up arms for liberty; men reverenced and exercised the freedom of\r\nthe soul. The breath of the new spirit moved over the earth; it revived\r\nPoland, animated Germany, swayed the north; and the inquisition of Spain\r\ncould not silence its whispers among the mountains of the Peninsula. It\r\ninvaded France; and, though bonfires of heretics, by way of warning,\r\nwere lighted at the gates of Paris, it infused itself into the French\r\nmind, and led to unwonted free discussions. Exile could not quench it.\r\nOn the banks of the Lake of Geneva, Calvin stood forth the boldest\r\nreformer of his day; not personally engaged in political intrigues,\r\nyet, by promulgating great ideas, forming the seed-plot of revolution.…\r\nCalvinism was revolutionary; wherever it came it created division.… By\r\nthe side of the eternal mountains and perennial snows and arrowy rivers\r\nof Switzerland, it established a religion without a prelate, a government\r\nwithout a king.… It entered Holland, inspiring an industrious nation\r\nwith heroic enthusiasm; enfranchising and uniting provinces; and making\r\nburghers, and weavers, and artisans, victors over the highest orders\r\nof Spanish chivalry, the power of the inquisition, and the pretended\r\nmajesty of kings. It penetrated Scotland, and while its whirlwind bore\r\nalong persuasion among glens and mountains, it shrunk from no danger,\r\nand hesitated at no ambition; it nerved its rugged but hearty envoy\r\nto resist the flatteries of the beautiful Queen Mary; it assumed the\r\neducation of her only son; it divided the nobility; it penetrated the\r\nmasses, overturned the ancient ecclesiastic establishment, planted free\r\nparochial schools, and gave a living energy to the principle of liberty\r\nin a people. It infused itself into England, and placed its plebeian\r\nsympathies in daring resistance to the courtly hierarchy; dissenting\r\nfrom dissent, longing to introduce the reign of righteousness, it invited\r\nevery man to read the Bible, and made itself dear to the common mind, by\r\nteaching, as a divine revelation, the unity of the race and the natural\r\nequality of man.”[I]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Bancroft has studied the Reformation, not simply in\r\nits outward political aspect, but so as to understand the different\r\nshades of theological belief that influenced the minds of the great\r\nreformers. His parallel between Luther and Calvin is a fine specimen\r\nof composition, noted for its vigorous English, clear, discriminating\r\njudgments, and polished style: “Both Luther and Calvin brought the\r\nindividual immediate relation with God; but Calvin, under a more stern\r\nand militant form of doctrine, lifted the individual above pope and\r\nprelate, and priest and presbyter, above Catholic church and national\r\nchurch and general synod, above indulgencies, remissions and absolutions\r\nfrom fellow-mortals, and brought him into immediate dependence on\r\nGod, whose eternal, irreversible choice is made by himself alone, not\r\narbitrarily, but according to his own highest wisdom and justice. Luther\r\nspared the altar, and hesitated to deny totally the real presence;\r\nCalvin, with superior dialectics, accepted as a commemoration and a seal\r\nthe rite which the Catholics revered as a sacrifice. Luther favored\r\nmagnificence in public worship, as an aid to devotion; Calvin, the\r\nguide of republics, avoided in their churches all appeals to the senses\r\nas a peril to pure religion. Luther condemned the Roman Church for\r\nits immorality; Calvin for its idolatry. Luther exposed the folly of\r\nsuperstition, ridiculed the hair shirt and the scourge, the purchased\r\nindulgence, and dearly bought, worthless masses for the dead; Calvin\r\nshrunk from their criminality with impatient horror. Luther permitted\r\nthe cross and the taper, pictures and images, as things of indifference;\r\nCalvin demanded a spiritual worship in its utmost purity. Luther left\r\nthe organization of the church to princes and governments; Calvin\r\nreformed doctrine, ritual, and practice; and, by establishing ruling\r\nelders in each church, and an elective synod, he secured to his policy a\r\nrepresentative character, which combined authority with popular rights.\r\nBoth Luther and Calvin insisted that, for each one, there is and can be\r\nno other priest than himself; and, as a consequence, both agreed in the\r\npurity of the clergy.”[J]\r\n\r\nWhile the rhetoric of Bancroft is not faultless, it certainly deserves a\r\nplace in our classic English. In the discussion of grave historical and\r\nphilosophical questions, his stateliness of expression and his dignity\r\nof style challenge our admiration. His descriptions are very fine, and\r\nsuggest a mind keenly alive to the beautiful and the poetical; but\r\nthey do not reveal that spontaneity so characteristic of Irving, nor\r\nthat indefinable symmetry so noticeable in Hawthorne. If his style is\r\nsometimes declamatory, I think it is generally in a connection such that\r\nthe cultivated taste will pronounce it admissible.\r\n\r\nThoroughly versed in the historic lore of this and other countries,\r\nbroad in his general scholarship, remarkably free from prejudice, an\r\nuncompromising American, and yet not an American in a narrow and bigoted\r\nsense, careful and systematic in his methods of labor and recreation,\r\nunswerving in his belief in the superintending providence of God, George\r\nBancroft justly merits the high place of honor and esteem so willingly\r\naccorded to him, and his noble example should be a never-failing source\r\nof inspiration.\r\n\r\n[E] Vol. III., p. 6.\r\n\r\n[F] Vol. II., p. 177.\r\n\r\n[G] Hist., Vol. II., p. 545.\r\n\r\n[H] Hist., Vol. III., p. 183.\r\n\r\n[I] Hist., Vol. III., p. 99.\r\n\r\n[J] Hist., Vol. I., p. 212.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGOING TO THE BOTTOM THE ONLY WAY TO REACH THE TOP.—First go to the bottom\r\nof everything which you have to do.

ALLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Fair Perseus slept upon enchanted ground,\r\n     And to him came, but with no stir or sound,\r\n     The goddess Pallas, whose clear, shining eyes\r\n     Read all men’s hearts that are beneath the skies.\r\n\r\n    “Many there be,” she cried, “who dwell at ease,\r\n     Who neither do nor dare—art thou of these?\r\n     Or dost thou to some glorious deed aspire?\r\n     Hast thou a heart of clay, or soul of fire?”\r\n\r\n     Then answered Perseus, vehement, “But I\r\n     Would do great deeds, though for them I should die.\r\n     Point me, O goddess, to the monster’s lair,\r\n     And give me leave to show what I can dare!”\r\n\r\n    “Nay,” said the voice divine, “thy stripling arm\r\n     Must first set free from danger’s fierce alarm\r\n     _Thy mother’s life!_” With this young Perseus woke,\r\n     Nor knew the peril whereof Pallas spoke.\r\n\r\n     But straight to Seriphus he hied with speed,\r\n     To find his Mother Danæ in sore need,\r\n     And rescuing her from danger and from dread,\r\n     _Then_ went he forth to win the Gorgon’s head.\r\n\r\n     O, sons and daughters of our happy land,\r\n     Whose waking dreams are filled with actions grand,\r\n     Ere yet in search of these afar you roam,\r\n     Free every burdened heart that sighs at home!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA OF TO-DAY.\r\n\r\nBY M. VICTOR DU BLED.\r\n\r\nAn Abridged Translation for THE CHAUTAUQUAN, from the _Révue des deux\r\nMondes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanada, for so long a time apparently forgotten by her mother country,\r\ncame out from her isolation and again called back to herself the\r\nattention of France by sending to the Exposition of 1855 specimens of\r\nher products. In 1856 M. de Belveze, commander of the French frigate\r\n“Capricieuse,” was sent into Canadian waters. His mission resulted in\r\nthe establishment of a French consulate, and the reduction of the tariff\r\nwhich permitted the two countries to enter upon commercial relations.\r\n\r\nFrom 1854 to 1862 material and intellectual progress here marched by the\r\nside of great political progress. Public works, canals, and interior\r\ncolonization, all, during this time received a vigorous impulse.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as spontaneous generation in politics any more\r\nthan in natural history. Questions give rise to other questions, and the\r\nphilosophy of history shows them springing up, one after another, from\r\nsome mysterious source, obeying a sort of atavism, and producing often a\r\nmost unexpected result. Excitement over representation, fixed according\r\nto the population of the country, gave birth to the confederacy. On\r\nOctober 1, 1864, a conference assembled at Quebec, composed of delegates\r\nfrom the maritime provinces, and from the Canadian government. After\r\na long and stormy session, during which threats of resorting to arms\r\nwere now and then heard, the cause of the confederation triumphed by a\r\nlarge majority. A basis of federal union was submitted to the several\r\nlegislatures for ratification, and on July 1, 1867, the confederacy was\r\nestablished in the midst of public rejoicings. They gave to the united\r\nprovinces the name of the Dominion of Canada. Lower Canada was called\r\nQuebec, and Upper Canada Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature is composed of a Governor-general, a sort of a\r\nconstitutional viceroy, named by the crown; of a Senate, and a House\r\nof Commons. The Senate consists of seventy-six members, appointed for\r\nlife by the crown, of whom twenty-four each are from Quebec and Ontario.\r\nThe House of Commons is representative, its members being elected for\r\nfive years. The Dominion now includes Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia,\r\nNew Brunswick, Prince Edward’s Island, British Columbia, Manitoba, and\r\nthe territory of the North-West, or Hudson’s Bay Territory. Thus it is\r\nfulfilling the prediction of the great American statesman, William H.\r\nSeward: “Canada is destined to become the seat of a great empire, the\r\nRussia of North America, but a Russia with civilization more advanced\r\nthan the Russia of Europe.” An illustrated paper of the Dominion has\r\npublished a patriotic caricature representing the Canadian Gulliver\r\nwith a debonair and placid figure, without any implements save his own\r\ngigantic arms and hands, seizing and swallowing the greater part of the\r\nAmerican continent, while a crowd of Lilliputians, armed to the teeth,\r\nTurks, Yankees, Germans and Italians, survey him with an envious and\r\nastonished air.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop her resources, and to open the way for immigration,\r\nthat her immense tracts of unused land may more rapidly become the\r\ngranary of the world, Canada is furrowing her domains with canals and\r\ninterlacing them with lines of railroads. The Grand Trunk railway,\r\ntraversing the country from Portland, Me., to Detroit, has been built,\r\nwith its Victoria bridge (one of the most noted structures in the world)\r\ncrossing the St. Lawrence opposite Montreal. Immense sums of money have\r\nbeen spent in order to convert the St. Lawrence into a canal. And now she\r\nis constructing a transcontinental road, which, binding the two oceans\r\nfrom Port Moody to Halifax, will cross the entire confederation. They\r\nexpect to finish this route in 1886, and it is estimated that the journey\r\nfrom Liverpool or Havre to Japan will be a thousand miles shorter by this\r\nroad than by the transcontinental routes of the United States.\r\n\r\nAlmost in the middle of the Dominion, at an equal distance from the pole\r\nto the equator, lies the territory of Manitoba. There lived in 1869, a\r\npopulation half nomadic, called the half-breeds, sprung from marriages\r\nbetween the French Canadians and the Indians. They spoke the French\r\nlanguage, and professed the Catholic religion. After the delivery of\r\nthis country by the Hudson’s Bay Company to the Dominion, the government\r\ndetermined to direct toward it a stream of English emigration. They sent\r\na governor and some surveyors to reside at Winnipeg, the capital. But\r\nthe natives warned them they might look for trouble if they attempted\r\nto place, without consulting them, new inhabitants upon the land which\r\nthey and their ancestors, from time immemorial, had held and enjoyed.\r\nThe government was not to be frightened, and so the conflict came.\r\nThe half-breeds obliged the governor to leave, and constituted a\r\nprovisional government, with a president at its head. They then drew up\r\na declaration, of which the following is the preamble:\r\n\r\n    “We, the representatives of the people, assembled in council at\r\n    Fort Garry, November 24, 1869, after having invoked the God of\r\n    nations, … solemnly declare, in the name of our constitution and\r\n    in our own name, before God and men, that we refuse to recognize\r\n    the authority of Canada, which pretends to have the right to\r\n    command us and impose upon us a despotic form of government.”\r\n\r\nLater, however, they changed their opinion, and entered into negotiations\r\nwith the federal government. But at the moment when all things had been\r\narranged without bloodshed, the English colonists, who were very numerous\r\naround Lake Winnipeg, rose in insurrection against the half-breeds. The\r\npresident of the latter, Louis Riel, who took upon himself the _rôle_ of\r\ndictator, had the leading mutineers seized, and their chief, named Scott,\r\nwas tried, condemned and shot. Far from establishing his authority, this\r\nexecution discouraged the natives themselves, and when two battalions\r\nof militia under Col. Wolseley arrived on the ground, they were\r\nwelcomed as liberators by the half-breeds, and Riel, with his leading\r\naccomplices, fled to the United States. A compromise was then effected,\r\nand Manitoba was annexed to the Dominion as an autonomous province. It\r\nsends to Parliament two senators and five representatives. Winnipeg\r\ncontains 30,000 inhabitants, and property has increased its value to an\r\nextraordinary degree, as the following anecdote will show: A parishioner\r\nof Archbishop Taché, obliged to leave the country, sought the archbishop,\r\nand excusing himself for not being able to pay the rent of his church\r\npew, offered as part payment a small piece of land; “scarcely what would\r\npay for a low mass,” timidly said the poor man. Ten years later that land\r\nbrought $14,000.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the expenses occasioned by her canals and railroads, the\r\npeople of the Dominion are, perhaps, among all the tax-payers of the\r\ncivilized world, those upon whom the smallest rates are levied. There is\r\nno standing army, only a simple militia of about 50,000 men. The total\r\nexpenses of government in 1884 amounted to $28,730,157. The receipts\r\nfor the same year were $36,800,000. The minister of finances, in making\r\nout his estimates for the year 1885 placed them as follows: Expenses,\r\n$29,811,639; receipts, $31,000,000, which were to be raised as follows:\r\nDuties, $20,000,000; excises, $5,500,000; postoffice returns, $1,900,000;\r\npublic works, $3,000,000; interest on investments, $750,000; other\r\nsources, $800,900. Duties on goods supply the source of two thirds of\r\nall the receipts. In 1880 they adopted a very strict system, which,\r\nwithout any distinction, exacts duties from English goods as from any\r\nother nation. On the other hand, England has granted to them the right of\r\nconcluding treaties of commerce with foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThe only difference of opinion in regard to the question of tariff\r\nexisting between the two parties is that the liberals wish the laws of\r\nentrance to be more moderate than the conservatives have made them, but\r\nneither of them will adopt the cosmopolitan theories of European free\r\ntrade. The English compare protection to a bullet, Canadian tariff to\r\na museum of instruments of torture, and declare that in following the\r\nexample of the United States, the Dominion has forgotten the fable of the\r\nfrog which wished to become as large as an ox. The Canadians hold that\r\nthey shall do what they think best for their country, and that duties are\r\nthe taxes least inconvenient to raise; that they save national work; and\r\nthat they not only have made up the deficits of the past, but have put\r\ninto the treasury an excess, so they have been able to reduce them to the\r\namount of two and one-fourth millions dollars. The tariff for protection\r\nhas become a tariff for revenue.\r\n\r\nSince 1853 especially, public instruction has made great progress.\r\nThese people who, under the patronage of the crown of England, have\r\nrealized the ideal conception of a conservative and Christian republic,\r\nhold that public schools are among the luxuries of a young nation, and\r\ndo not hesitate to impose upon themselves heavy sacrifices, as they\r\nbelieve they will result in good to their children. In the province of\r\nQuebec alone, government expended during the year 1882-83, $350,000\r\nfor school buildings, while the contributions paid directly by the\r\npeople amounted to more than $2,000,000. In a population of 1,359,027\r\ninhabitants, statistics show that there are 5,039 schools of different\r\ngrades; 7,211 professors and teachers, and 245,225 scholars, making an\r\naverage of one scholar for every six inhabitants. As to universities\r\nand colleges, they do not come under the school regulations, but are\r\nindependent institutions, which, however, may receive appropriations\r\nfrom the government on condition of making a report each year to the\r\nsuperintendent. When in a school district there live a number of families\r\nwho profess a different religion from that of the majority, they have\r\nthe right to have for their children separate schools, under the care\r\nof three officials, chosen by them. Thus Catholics and Protestants have\r\nequal privileges, and everything is done to secure respect for religion,\r\nindependence to the citizen, and his active and constant interest in\r\neducational matters. The circulars of the present superintendent, M.\r\nOuimet, define in clear terms the spirit of the school laws in Quebec:\r\n“In our system of primary instruction we first teach the children the\r\ncatechism of true religion, in order that they may know how to serve\r\nGod; then the manuals of agriculture and of design, in order to put them\r\nin condition to serve their country. _For God and country!_ Behold the\r\nwords which the Canadian legislature has inscribed on the walls of her\r\neducational institutions. The state unites itself to the two systems of\r\nreligion in the matter of education, and does not authorize any school to\r\nbe atheistical, but demands of it to be Christian before it accords help.\r\nIt does not provide that one church shall be helped rather than another.\r\nFull and entire liberty it demands, and from this comes perfect harmony\r\namong the people.”\r\n\r\nReligious liberty marches by the side of educational liberty. Each church\r\nsupports itself; the state no longer takes cognizance of clergy or\r\ncongregations, to protect them, to annoy them, or to persecute. They can,\r\nas the citizens, found a university, a college, or a school.\r\n\r\nMen such as Labelle and Racine have accomplished wonderful results in\r\nplanting in the most barren regions, at the peril of their lives, strong\r\nand flourishing colonies. “Go west,” incessantly repeated Horace Greeley\r\nto young Americans. “Go north, French Canadians and Catholics,” said\r\nFather Labelle, with a prophetic foresight.\r\n\r\nCanadian literature only dates back to 1840. Before that time it was made\r\nup of songs. Such a literature was absolutely essential to the gay and\r\nsociable race who consoled itself, in all its troubles, with stanzas.\r\nThere was a time when France held the government under control by her\r\nsongs. Did any Canadian patriot attract attention by some great deed?\r\nAt once a song was written. Was the question that of elections? They\r\naddressed themselves to some crude poet, and sharp, malign couplets soon\r\noverran the country. The festival of St. Jean Baptiste has furnished many\r\na contribution to this list, and Sir George Cartier owes in great part\r\nhis popularity to the fact that he composed one for the first banquet, in\r\n1834. Often among the remote rural districts are found people possessing\r\nmagnificent tenor voices, which would make the fortune of an impressario\r\nwho would come from the other side of the water to look them up.\r\n\r\n“We are yet amateurs,” said one of their writers to me. Without endorsing\r\nthis very modest judgment, one can but admit that up to the present time\r\nour American cousins have been more occupied with making history than\r\nwith writing it. Action has absorbed thought. They have run, closely\r\npressed on all sides, to the conquest of political liberties. The books\r\nwhich they published during their unsettled national history partook of\r\nthe character of the times, as the great work of Garneau will show, which\r\nwas a revelation to his countrymen, and was of more value to them than\r\nan army, since it assured them of a nation’s faith and the certainty of\r\nsuccess. The greater part of the writers have been obliged to tax their\r\ningenuity for a livelihood, and too often politics, that deceptive siren,\r\nkeeps them from those severe studies which alone will bring talent to\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nIn poetry, MM. Crémazie and Louis Fréchette have left behind them all\r\nrivals. High inspiration, poetic fervor, appreciation of nature, and\r\nlove of country have made them true poets. One can not read without\r\nemotion some of the productions of M. Crémazie. His patriotic songs,\r\nwhich seem to have been breathed from the very heart of the country\r\nitself, in a language harmonious and vibrating, do not for an instant\r\ndecline in interest or power. The verses of M. Fréchette are written in a\r\ngraceful style, and possess a youthful freshness. In history, MM. l’Abbé\r\nCasgrain, Benjamin Sulte and Joseph Tassé have become distinguished. M.\r\nTassé, in his book “Canadians of the West,” tells of the pioneers of the\r\nAmerican continent, those who penetrated into the icy regions of the\r\npole, who crossed the Rocky Mountains, and spread over the fertile plains\r\nof Mexico; and has shown that of them all the French in the Canadian\r\nsettlements were the only ones who treated the Indians honorably and\r\nkindly, and who succeeded in winning their respect and affection.\r\n\r\nThe group of prose writers and romancers is increasing every day. One of\r\nthe best, without doubt, is M. J. C. Taché, the author of three legends,\r\neach of which characterizes an epoch in the history of the Indians. M.\r\nde Gaspé, with his “Ancient Canadians,” and M. Joseph Marmette, with his\r\nhistoric romances have acquired a well merited reputation.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, shall be the aim in the future of Canadian literature? To\r\nacquire new strength and vigor without ceasing the study of the past;\r\nto revive the glorious annals; to gather with a pious care its legends;\r\nto identify itself also with the present; to paint the manners and the\r\ncontemporaneous social life; to note and to report the majestic symphony\r\nof their land; never to lose sight of the thought of Carlyle, that the\r\nuniverse is a temple as well as a workshop. Such will be the duty of\r\nCanadian writers.\r\n\r\nThe Canadians through all the years since their country passed out of\r\nthe hands and the control of the French, have clung to them with great\r\naffection, drawn by some profound and mystic instinct, by the lines of\r\nheredity, the power of traditions, the religion of memory. They are not\r\nignorant of the fact that if they had remained united to France, they\r\nwould not now have, in all probability, their free social and religious\r\ninstitutions; they would likely have formed an administrative colony\r\nsuch as Algeria. They know that it was England who sent them, under hard\r\ncircumstances, perhaps, to the school of liberty, and to her they are\r\nindebted for their prosperity, but they look to France still as their\r\nmother country. Why should not that country give them some more solid\r\nproof of its affection? While with South America the annual exchanges of\r\nFrance are counted by the hundred million, and great numbers of French\r\npeople emigrate there, her total commerce with Canada does not exceed\r\n$15,000,000, and it is with great difficulty that she has commenced to\r\nsend thither a few of her citizens. Why should not French emigration\r\ndirect itself toward a country where wages are good, the soil fertile,\r\nwhere property offers itself to all, and where a welcome is awaiting\r\nthem? Why should not the French go to visit the Canadians and learn of\r\nthem how a people became and remain free?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME AMERICAN MUSEUMS.\r\n\r\nBY CLARENCE COOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this heading it is intended to give in successive numbers of THE\r\nCHAUTAUQUAN descriptions of the principal Art Museums of our country:\r\nThe Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New\r\nYork, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the\r\nCorcoran Art Gallery in Washington. We begin in the present number with\r\nthe Boston Museum.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1870 the trustees of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts were\r\norganized under a charter from the Massachusetts legislature. It was not,\r\nhowever, until 1876 that a building was erected in which the pictures,\r\ncasts, antiquities, engravings and objects of curiosity which formed the\r\nnucleus of its present extensive collections could be exhibited to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nUp to the time when the first portion of the present building was\r\nerected, the amateur or the student of the fine arts in Boston or its\r\nneighborhood had been obliged to take a good deal of trouble, and to\r\nspend much time, if he would see the few objects that existed there—in\r\npublic institutions or in private houses—in the domain of painting,\r\nsculpture, antiquities, or in that of the minor arts—now classed together\r\nin popular speech under the incorrect title of bric-a-brac.\r\n\r\nBeside the permanent exhibition of the pictures which belonged to it, the\r\nAthenæum Library had generously devoted some of its rooms every season\r\nfor several successive years to the exhibition of pictures painted by\r\nAmerican artists, an exhibition answering to those held yearly by the\r\nNational Academy of Design and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\r\nBeside these regular exhibitions, there had been many occasional ones of\r\nimportance, such as that of the Spanish pictures belonging to the Duc de\r\nMontpensier, which gave to those of us who had not visited Europe, the\r\nopportunity of seeing respectable specimens of the works of Zurbaran,\r\nHerrera, Morales, Murillo, Ribalta and Velasquez. There was also in the\r\nAthenæum a small but well selected collection of plaster-casts of antique\r\nsculpture, so that for a long time this institution was an art center of\r\nno little value and importance. The Athenæum was not, however, an art\r\ninstitution, but a library, and the time came when the increase of the\r\nlibrary made it necessary to give up its art collections and devote all\r\nits space to books.\r\n\r\nThe collections of the Athenæum were the most important, both in number\r\nand in value, to be found in Boston, but there were many interesting\r\nobjects scattered about which it was felt would be of much greater\r\nservice to the community if they could be brought together under\r\none roof, and made to work in common for the education of the whole\r\ncommunity. The late Francis C. Gray had bequeathed to Harvard College his\r\nlarge and valuable collection of engravings together with a fund for its\r\nmaintenance, and it was found that its usefulness, whether for purposes\r\nof enjoyment or as a means of education was very much restricted by its\r\nbeing so far away from the capital. Yet it had been impossible to find\r\na proper place for it in Boston, and it therefore remained shut up in\r\nCambridge. The Institute of Technology had formed, under the direction\r\nof Prof. William R. Ware, a collection of architectural ornament, but\r\nas this was lodged in the Institute building it could only be seen and\r\nstudied at such times as suited the convenience of the professors and\r\ntheir pupils. The Social Science Association had called the attention of\r\nthe public to the need that existed of a large and complete collection of\r\ncasts of antique sculpture. But—what to do with such a collection, could\r\nit be brought together?\r\n\r\nIn a city like Boston, a want so deeply felt could not long remain\r\nunsatisfied, and the matter having been widely discussed, and a general\r\ninterest created in the public mind, the first steps were taken with\r\ngenerous unanimity, and as has been stated, a charter was procured from\r\nthe legislature, the Museum was organized by the naming of trustees, and\r\nthe city having given a site, no difficulty was met with in raising a\r\nsubscription of $261,000 toward a building. The plans of Messrs. Sturgis\r\nand Brigham, submitted in competition, were selected, and on the 3d of\r\nJuly, 1876, one wing of the front of the building was opened to the\r\npublic. This was filled by the collections of the Athenæum, and by the\r\nGray collection of engravings, both permanently loaned to the Museum,\r\nby the casts of antique sculptures purchased with funds bequeathed by\r\nthe late Charles Sumner, the Egyptian collections presented by Mr. C.\r\nGranville Way, and valuable gifts from Mr. Lawrence and other persons.\r\nThe space at the disposal of the trustees was soon overcrowded, and in\r\n1878 a fresh subscription of $126,000 having been raised, the front\r\nwas completed and opened to the public in 1879. At the present time\r\nof writing the need is seriously felt for more room, and it is hoped\r\nthat the means may soon be provided for taking a third step toward the\r\ncompletion of the original plan of the building.\r\n\r\nThe building containing the collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Art\r\nis constructed of red brick and terra cotta on a basement of granite.\r\nIt stands in the new quarter of the city, and is built like all other\r\nstructures in that part of the city, on piles. It is rather ornate in its\r\ncharacter, and compared with its massive neighbor, Trinity Church, has\r\na somewhat effeminate look, but it is solidly built, and planned with\r\ngreat good sense, and with a steady view to convenience. On entering,\r\nthe visitor finds himself in a large hall, in the center of which rises\r\nan ample staircase conducting to the second floor. At the right and left\r\nare doorways leading to the rooms containing the casts from antique\r\nsculpture. By taking either of these doorways we can make the circuit\r\nof the whole series of apartments, but as the present arrangement is\r\nonly temporary, awaiting the completion of the building for a logical\r\ndisposition of the material, it may be better to pass at once to the rear\r\nof the hall, and taking the door at the left hand, enter\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EGYPTIAN ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this room were chiefly collected between the years 1828\r\nand 1833, by a Scotch gentleman, Mr. Robert Hay. After his death they\r\nwere purchased by Mr. C. Granville Way, of Boston, and presented to the\r\nMuseum in 1872. Several fine pieces of sculpture, collected in Egypt in\r\n1835 by the late Mr. John Lowell, the founder of the Lowell Institute,\r\nhave been added to this room by the gift of Mr. Lowell’s heirs. The\r\nvaluable and interesting casts from bas-reliefs and statues are the gift\r\nof General Charles G. Loring, the director of the Museum, to whose zeal\r\nand efficiency the institution owes so much of its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe room is finely lighted by large windows, and General Loring, who is\r\nmuch interested in botany, generally keeps here a few fine specimens\r\nof tropical plants, especially such as belong to Egypt. Thus, on the\r\noccasion of my last visit, I had the pleasure of seeing there a fine\r\nspecimen of the papyrus plant waving its graceful fans in salute to\r\nPasht and Amenophis, hard by. The giant figure of Amenophis III., the\r\nMemnon of the Greeks (1500 B. C.) is a cast from the granite original\r\nin the British Museum. Near it is the statue of Pasht, the Cat-headed,\r\nin black granite, with the cartouch of Amenophis III., and there are\r\nalso several blocks of red granite, probably portions of a throne, with\r\na few fragments of sculpture—the colossal head of a king, pieces of\r\nthe lid of a sarcophagus in green basalt, and two capitals cut out of\r\nsandstone, showing the lotos and papyrus forms. In the center of the room\r\nare several mummy cases, and in glass cases are disposed mummied heads,\r\nskulls, hands and feet, with mummies of animals, the cat, the dog, the\r\ndog-faced ape, the hawk and the ibis. In one of these cases is a hand\r\nstill bearing a ring on the fourth finger. The remaining cases contain\r\nvery interesting specimens of mummy-cloth of various dates and quality,\r\none of the most important being a robe of justification supposed to be\r\nworn in the trial of the deceased before Osiris. It is sixteen feet in\r\nlength by six feet nine inches in width, and has a fringe. The remaining\r\ncontents of this room consist of various objects gathered from the\r\ntombs and from the mummy cases in such number and variety as to make it\r\nimpossible to describe them in the narrow space at my command. But while\r\nthere can be no doubt as to the value of the collection as a means of\r\nstudy in a field of wide interest and importance, it may be said, so far\r\nas art is concerned, the Way collection is of less value than the Abbott\r\ncollection in the Historical Society of New York City. Each collection,\r\nhowever, supplements the other in a most interesting way, and taken\r\ntogether, they enable a student to make a fair beginning in the study of\r\nEgyptian antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST GREEK ROOM\r\n\r\nOpens directly from the Egyptian Room, and contains casts of archaic and\r\nearly Greek sculpture. Here will be found the Lions from the gate of\r\nMycenæ, the funeral slabs of Orchomenos, of Aristion, and of the soldier\r\nof Marathon, the Dresden Pallas, the relief of Demeter, Persephone, and\r\nTriptolemus, from Athens, and the so-called Leucothea, and the infant\r\nBacchus from the Villa Albani, with several interesting archaic reliefs\r\nfrom the same collection. There have lately been added to the Museum a\r\nnumber of the funeral slabs or _stele_ discovered at Athens and preserved\r\nin the museum there, objects of great beauty and interest, properly\r\nbelonging, either in this room or in immediate connection with it, but\r\nplaced for temporary convenience, in the Roman and Renaissance Room. The\r\nmost important objects in this First Greek Room are the casts from the\r\nsculptures of the eastern and western Pediments of the Temple of Minerva\r\nat Egina, consisting of five figures from the eastern pediment and ten\r\nfrom the western, arranged as they are believed to have been originally.\r\nPassing from this room to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND GREEK ROOM\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves in the midst of a group of statues, most of them of\r\nthe Praxitelean type and making too sharp a contrast by their grace and\r\nsensuous refinement to the hardness and severity of the contents of the\r\nroom just left. It must be remembered, however, that owing to the small\r\nspace at the command of the Museum authorities it has not been possible\r\nto follow a strict chronological order, and we must therefore be content\r\nfor the present to follow the arrangement of the separate rooms. We have,\r\ntherefore, here, the casts from the Parthenon frieze, the Theseus and\r\nthe Fates from the eastern and the Ilissus from the western Pediment of\r\nthe same building, with the Torso of the Victory, also from the eastern\r\nPediment, together with several figures from the temple of the Wingless\r\nVictory (Nikè Apteros) on the acropolis. But space fails us to enumerate\r\nall the casts contained in the rooms devoted to antique sculpture; and\r\nwhy attempt a mere catalogue? The Venus of Milo is here, and the lately\r\ndiscovered Hermes with the infant Dionysus, the Niobe and her daughter,\r\nthe Ludovisi Mars, the Diana of the Louvre, the Apollo Belvidere, the\r\nEirene and Plutus, the Faun of Praxiteles, and the glorious mask of the\r\nLudovisi Juno. Indeed, we miss few works of prime importance, and there\r\nare many casts here that can not be found elsewhere in America, and which\r\nare yet essential to even a superficial study of the rise and progress\r\nof Greek sculpture. Passing on, we come to the other rooms where are the\r\nLaocoön, the Dying Gladiator, the younger Agrippina, the Sophocles, the\r\nDemosthenes, the Menander, the Æsculapius, the Discobulus, the Silenus\r\nand the infant Bacchus, and the Boy taking a Thorn from his Foot (the\r\nSpinario), with many another famous and less famous work, enabling us to\r\ncarry on the study until the stream dies away to rise again in new beauty\r\nin the art of the early Italian Renaissance. While no capital piece can\r\nbe said to be wanting to this collection there remain many pieces to be\r\nadded which are needed for fullness of knowledge, but every year sees\r\nimportant acquisitions, and there can be no doubt, judging from the past\r\nhistory of the Museum, that if the wished for addition to the building\r\ncould be made, the missing gaps in the sculpture would speedily be filled\r\nup by gift. But before leaving the antique rooms we must mention the\r\ntwo sarcophagi from Vulci, now deposited in the Museum, and which, it\r\nis earnestly to be hoped, will become its property, since they are not\r\nonly deeply interesting in themselves, but have an added value from their\r\ngreat rarity. They represent the bodies of two married pair reposing upon\r\nthe lids of the two sarcophagi, as on the marriage-bed. The finer of the\r\ntwo groups is carved in alabaster, the other is in travertine; the one\r\nin alabaster has a monumental beauty and sweet dignity that is surpassed\r\nby nothing of the kind that exists, and considering its great beauty and\r\nrarity it is said there is only one other example of this treatment of\r\nthe subject, and that is in the Vatican.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Hall of Entrance, to which we have returned, we find\r\nourselves in the last of the antique sculpture rooms, where are placed\r\nsome of the most interesting of the Roman works just enumerated. Nothing\r\nwould be gained by an attempt to catalogue the rooms at present, as\r\ntheir contents are likely to be changed at any time when the projected\r\nenlargement of the Museum is carried out. The space in this portion of\r\nthe building, the addition built in 1879, answering to that occupied in\r\nthe older portion by the first and second Greek Rooms, is here thrown\r\ninto one large apartment filled with the\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTS OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe principal object here is the cast of the Caryatid Portico of the\r\nPandroseion, one of the portions of the complex structure generally\r\ncalled the Erechtheium, from the name of one of its parts dedicated to\r\nthe worship of Erechtheus. The Portico with its Caryatids is given here\r\nof the full size of the original, and is so placed (until the great\r\ncourt can be built in which these large objects are to be shown) that a\r\ngood view of it can be obtained from a considerable distance, while it\r\nis well lighted by a large window at one side. The remaining objects in\r\nthis room are casts in great numbers from Greek and Roman architectural\r\nornament, from the ornament of the Italian Renaissance, from the\r\nAlhambra, from the Gothic buildings of France, Germany and England,\r\nthe specimens from England including twelve out of the thirty angels\r\ncomposing the so-called angel choir of Lincoln Cathedral. These figures\r\nof angels playing on musical instruments are of the thirteenth century,\r\nand are among the most beautiful works of their time. In this room again\r\nwe find it impossible to do justice to our subject; the variety is too\r\ngreat and the range of artistic development covered by the example too\r\nextensive to be dismissed in less than an entire article, and even that\r\nwould be insufficient. Turning to the right at the end of this room we\r\ncome to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE,\r\n\r\nWhere the works of Michelangelo, Donatello, Ghiberti, Luca della Robbia,\r\nand a few other such names meet us in some of their best works. Here is\r\nthe Lorenzo of Michelangelo with the statues of Day and Night, the David\r\nof Donatello, the Cupid of Michelangelo with his unfinished bas-relief\r\nof the Virgin and Child, the Mercury of John of Bologna, and various\r\nbas-reliefs of the time with the singing boys of Donatello and those\r\nof Luca della Robbia. Here, too, is the cast of the trial plate, “The\r\nSacrifice of Isaac,” made by Ghiberti in competition with Brunelleschi\r\nand Donatello for the Florence Baptistery Gates, interesting in itself,\r\nand in connection with that most important event in the history of modern\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThe last room on this floor is filled with specimens of Greek, Roman,\r\nand Asia Minor pottery, with a sufficient number of examples of the\r\nsculpture, pottery, and glass of Cyprus, a small but well-chosen group of\r\nfigurines from Tanagra, and the results of the late researches at Assos\r\nby the members of the American Society of Archæology. This room is full\r\nof interesting objects, but it is uncomfortably crowded and necessarily\r\nill-arranged. In the next article we shall describe the contents of the\r\nsecond floor of the Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY AND PEOPLE OF BORNEO.\r\n\r\nReport of a lecture delivered March 7th in the National Museum of\r\nWashington, D. C., by Mr. Wm. T. Hornaday, Chief Taxidermist of the\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Borneo is the home of the Head-hunter, the land of the\r\norang-utan, the Garden of the Sun, and perhaps even the sepulchre of the\r\nmissing link. There is a possibility of its being the cradle of a great\r\nempire which shall be at the zenith of its glory when the greatness\r\nof the United States shall have passed away, like that of Greece and\r\nRome, and Washington have become the Athens of America. The center of\r\nhuman progress will probably eventually move into regions now peopled\r\nby savages only, and the Kaffir or Dyak of the thirtieth century will\r\nperhaps study the archæology of the Yankee with the same interest that we\r\nnow bestow upon the ruins of Carthage and Mycenæ.\r\n\r\nBorneo is situated nearly in the middle of the Malay Archipelago. Its\r\ngreatest length is 850 miles, greatest width 630 miles, and its area is\r\n192,000 square miles. The whole of New England, the Middle States and\r\nVirginia could be set down in the evergreen forests, which everywhere\r\ncover its surface, and still be surrounded by a wide belt of jungle.\r\nThe whole interior is very mountainous. The rivers and creeks are the\r\nhighways of Borneo, and other roads are practically unknown. Nothing\r\ncould be more arduous, and full of risk to life and limb, than overland\r\ntravel through such dense forests and over such rugged mountains as\r\nconfront the explorer at every step. The interior is practically an\r\nuninhabitable wilderness. Even in this age of daring and persevering\r\ntravelers, no white man has ever crossed the island from one side to the\r\nother. The interior is still a land of mystery, whence come marvelous\r\naccounts of a race of men with tails, with detailed descriptions of their\r\nappearance and habits, stories implicitly believed by many natives.\r\nThe climate of Borneo is what one would least expect, considering its\r\nequatorial position. The temperature is very agreeable all the year\r\nround. The mercury usually stands at 80° Fahrenheit in the morning, 88°\r\nat midday, seldom reaching 90°, and never exceeding 93°. The annual\r\nvariation of temperature is only 24°—from 69° to 93°. Usually there are\r\nabout 200 rainy days in the year, and from 158 to 178 inches of rain.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of Borneo is probably unsurpassed by that of any other\r\ncountry in the world, either in luxuriance, economic value, or, the\r\npossession of wonderful forms. On the spurs of Mount Kina Balu are found\r\nfour species of pitcher plants (Nepenthes), of marvelous size and form\r\nand gorgeous colors. The largest pitchers of _Nepenthes rajah_ measure\r\nthirteen inches in length, twenty in circumference, and hold five pints\r\nof water. Among the curiosities of vegetation is the tapang tree, which,\r\nin lieu of spur roots, throws out enormous slab-like buttresses. The\r\n_cocoa_ palm bears a bountiful crop of nuts, which in turn yield oil and\r\na coarse kind of sugar. The _sago_ palm yields the valuable pearl sago\r\nof commerce. The _areca_ palm produces the betel-nut, which, together\r\nwith a fresh pepper-leaf and a bit of moist lime, is in the mouth of\r\nnearly every East Indian native in lieu of tobacco. The _nipa_ palm\r\nyields salt, toddy, excellent syrup and sugar, and the leaves are made\r\ninto kadjangs for boat awnings and roofing material for houses. The\r\n_gomouti_ palm produces the best toddy, and the cabbage is esteemed by\r\nthe natives as food. The _nibong_ palm is valuable for its timber. The\r\nprimeval forests are rich in timber trees, one of which, the _bilian_,\r\nfurnishes wood which seemingly never decays. Bamboo grows abundantly in\r\nthe interior, and is of great use to the natives.\r\n\r\nOf the many fruits of the forest we can only refer to the durian. In size\r\nand shape it resembles a roundish pineapple, and is set all over with\r\nsharp conical spines, three fourths of an inch long, and stout enough to\r\npierce the hide of a rhinoceros. When the fruit is ripe, the pod opens of\r\nits own accord. Although the smell of the pod is most offensive, we find\r\ninside four or five large cells, in each of which are from three to five\r\nhorse-chestnuts, coated thickly with the most delicious paste that ever\r\ntickled the palate of man.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural products consist of sago, gambier, rice, sugar-cane and\r\ncotton, which is grown to a limited extent by the Dyaks. The cultivation\r\nof coffee is now engaging the attention of enterprising English planters,\r\nand may eventually become the most important industry of the island.\r\n\r\nThe whole island teems with animal life in great variety of forms. It\r\nwould appear, judging from the success of Mr. A. R. Wallace, to be a\r\nparadise for the entomologist. This gentleman once collected seventy-six\r\nspecies of beetles in one day, many of which were new and of remarkable\r\nform, and during his stay of fifteen months in Sarawak he took over 500\r\nspecies. There are a number of handsome species of butterflies, including\r\nthe magnificent _Ornithoptera Brookana_. This butterfly is eight inches\r\nin width, and of a rich, velvety black color, on which is a broad band\r\nof metallic green scales, resembling a humming-bird’s feathers. Of all\r\ninsects Borneo is richest in moths. At one place, on a mountain top, Mr.\r\nWallace took 200 specimens in a single night, representing 130 species.\r\nIn the same place he took in twenty-six nights 1,300 specimens of moths.\r\n\r\nThe fishes include quite a variety of fresh-water species, among which\r\nmay be mentioned the curious tree-climbing perch, the thread-fish, the\r\ncelebrated _gourami_, the jumping-fish, or _Periophthalmus_, which hops\r\nabout on land in search of small crustaceans stranded by the receding\r\ntide; and the very rare and curious little fish known to icthyologists as\r\n_Luciocephalus pulcher_. The Malays capture a great many fish in small\r\nstreams by poisoning the water with an extract made from the pounded\r\nroots of the tuba plant, and either spearing or netting the fish when\r\nthey rise to the surface to breathe.\r\n\r\nAmong the reptiles, the most important is the crocodile, which attains\r\na maximum length of seventeen feet, and is very destructive to human\r\nlife. It seldom happens that a person escapes or is rescued, after\r\nbeing seized in this burly reptile’s powerful jaws. Some years ago the\r\nSarawak government began a war of extermination against the crocodiles,\r\nby offering a reward of 35 cents a foot for all killed in the Territory.\r\nIn 1878, 266 crocodiles were killed, and $738 paid out in rewards. I\r\ndiscovered a crocodile’s nest containing fifty-five eggs. The native\r\ncrocodile hunters use hook and line. The hook, or _alir_, as it is called\r\nby the Malays, is a simple contrivance made of wood, tied at the end\r\nof a tough bark rope. Another saurian, the gavial, is found in Borneo.\r\nIt is not unlike that of the Ganges, called by Dr. Gray, _Tomistoma\r\nschlegelli_. This species inhabits the headwaters of some of the rivers,\r\nand is rarely seen. In the swampy forest near the coast, small reptiles\r\nare very abundant. There are pythons in Borneo twenty-four feet long. Two\r\ntwelve-foot specimens were brought to me, and a monster python twenty\r\nfeet six inches long, I purchased alive in a cage, and put to death for\r\nits skin and skeleton.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the contrary opinion of many observers, I think it can\r\nnot be said with truth that Borneo is rich in bird-life. There are 392\r\nspecies on the island. The finest bird is the argus pheasant. In life\r\nits plumage has a soft, velvety richness which is never seen in a dry\r\nspecimen. These birds are extremely shy, and are taken by the natives\r\nin snares. Hornbills of several varieties are numerous. A bird of great\r\ncommercial value is the swallow which builds the edible nest, so dear to\r\nthe palate of the Chinese mandarin. These nests are built in caves, and\r\nare of a gelatinous substance resembling white glue. Their shape is like\r\na small soup ladle with a broad, flat handle about an inch long. There\r\nare two kinds of nests, the white and the black, the former being most\r\nprized. A picul (133 pounds) of these is worth from two to three thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nBorneo is favored with a great variety of very interesting mammals. So\r\nfar as is at present known, there are ninety-six species, thirty-three\r\nof which are not found elsewhere. In apes and monkeys the island is\r\nespecially rich. At the head of the list is the huge, red-haired\r\norang-utan, of which we will speak presently. Then comes the long-nosed\r\nmonkey, with its immense flabby proboscis. The _Nasalis_ is a large\r\nspecies of monkey, found in the same localities as the orang, always\r\nover the water, and usually in large troops. It is something marvelous\r\nto watch a troop of monkeys, when terrified by an attack with firearms.\r\nThey head directly away from the danger, and gallop madly through the\r\ntree-tops along the larger branches. Another interesting mammal is the\r\nlong-armed ape, _Hylobates concolor_. This animal is extremely wary, and\r\nso rapid in its flight as to render pursuit exceedingly difficult. The\r\nflying lemur is also found here. Another curious monkey is the tarsier,\r\na small, nocturnal animal. The krah, _Macacus cynomolgus_, actually\r\nswarms in the low trees along the river banks. The clouded leopard, the\r\notter-cat, and civet cats of two species occur, and also several other\r\nsmall members of the cat tribe. Two species of bear are found, the\r\nsmallest known. The Indian elephant occurs in the extreme northeastern\r\npart of the island; also the rhinoceros and tapir. These three are very\r\nrare. The thin-haired deer is very common in Sarawak Territory, and is\r\nfrequently noosed by the natives. The muntjac, or rib-faced deer, is\r\noccasionally met. Wild hogs are very abundant and destructive. They\r\nsometimes measure forty inches at the shoulder, and are good swimmers.\r\nMany beautiful squirrels are found here, and also, remarkable bats, the\r\nbear cat, otter, porcupines, and other small mammals which fall an easy\r\nprey to the hunter-naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe orang-utan is found only in Borneo and Sumatra, but is more abundant\r\nin the former island. It is most numerous in the Sarawak Territory. This\r\nanimal occupies the fourth highest place in the animal kingdom—first,\r\nman; second, gorilla; third, chimpanzee; and fourth, orang-utan. This\r\nname signifies “Jungle-man,” and is derived from two Malay words,\r\n“orang,” man, and “utan,” jungle. The latter word is usually corrupted\r\ninto “otang” or “outang.” The animal itself is rare and difficult to\r\nfind. In August, 1878, I went on a hunting expedition for orangs to the\r\nSadong River, at the mouth of which I settled and commenced prospecting.\r\nOne day two men arrived from the headwaters of the Simujan River. They\r\nsaid they had seen two _mias_ (orangs), and suggested that I should go up\r\nto their village for a week or so. This I did, and was very successful,\r\ntaking thirty-one orangs during my first month. In my visit of three\r\nmonths I secured forty-three orangs. Of these twenty-seven fell to my\r\nrifle, the remainder being shot for me by natives. Our plan of hunting\r\nwas to paddle leisurely up and down the streams in a Malay sampan, or\r\ndug-out canoe, and watch the tree-tops on both sides as far back as we\r\ncould see. I was armed with a Maynard rifle and field glass, while three\r\nstout Malays or Dyaks furnished the motive power at the paddles. Once in\r\nsight of an orang it was a comparatively easy matter to send a ball into\r\nits breast. On one occasion, while paddling up the Simujan River on a\r\nbright forenoon in September, the Malay suddenly exclaimed “Mias! Mias!\r\nTuan!” The other paddlers backed water at once, but we saw nothing until\r\nthe boat had been backed several yards. Then we espied simply the knee of\r\na large orang which was lying asleep on a branch about twenty feet above\r\nthe water, and twenty yards from us. Its body was completely hidden by\r\nthe foliage, so I stood up in the boat and fired at its leg to arouse\r\nit. It started up instantly, growling hoarsely with pain and rage, and\r\nstarted to swing away with a reach that was surprising in its length.\r\nFortunately, the water was deep; there were no screw-pines to hinder our\r\nprogress, and in a moment our sampan was directly under the old fellow,\r\nwho then climbed high into the tree-top to escape us. It was a huge\r\nold mias chappin, the species with the expanded cheeks, long-haired,\r\nbig and burly. It growled savagely at us, and one of my Malays kept\r\nsaying, “Chappin! Mias Chappin! Fire, sir, fire! That’s Mias Chappin.\r\nBig—big.” My companions were all intensely excited, but I knew the old\r\nfellow was ours, and waited for a good shot. In a moment the opportunity\r\ncame, and I fired twice in quick succession at the orang’s breast. It\r\nstopped suddenly, hung for a moment by its hands, then its hold gave\r\nway, and it came plunging downward, snapped off a large dead limb on the\r\nway, and fell broadside into the water, with a tremendous splash which\r\nsent the spray flying all over us. As we seized the arms and pulled\r\nthe massive head up to the surface of the water, the old fellow gave a\r\ngreat gasp, and looked reproachfully at us out of his half-closed eyes.\r\nI will never forget the strange, and even awful sensation with which I\r\nregarded the face of the dying monster. There was nothing in it in the\r\nleast suggestive of anything human, but I felt as if I had shot some grim\r\nand terrible gnome or river-god—a satyr, indeed. It was a perfect giant\r\nin size, larger than even the natives had ever seen before. Its head,\r\nbody and limbs were of grand proportions, and its weight could not have\r\nbeen much, if any, less than 190 pounds. This individual is now in the\r\nNational Museum, to the extreme left of the group of orangs in the Mammal\r\nHall. The tallest specimen I secured measured four feet six inches, but\r\nmy largest one, that just described, measured half an inch less in height.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of orang found in Borneo: _Simia Wurmbii_,\r\ncharacterized in the males by very broad, flat cheek calossities, and\r\n_Simia satyrus_. English naturalists recognize a third species, _Simia\r\nmorio_, but without any tenable grounds for doing so.\r\n\r\nOrangs in a state of nature are seldom if ever seen on the ground. At\r\nnight this animal builds a nest in the forks of a tree or on the top of\r\na small sapling, by breaking off a quantity of green boughs, and piling\r\nthem in the crotch. On these he lies upon his back, grasping with hands\r\nand feet the largest branches within reach. Orangs are perfectly harmless\r\nto human beings unless brought to bay on the ground. They are then as\r\nfierce as tigers. Their food consists of wild fruits, particularly the\r\ndurian when in season, the tender shoots of the _Pandanus_, and the\r\nleaves of certain trees.\r\n\r\nAlthough the aboriginal inhabitants of Borneo are divided into several\r\ntribes and scores of sub-tribes or clans, they may with reasonable\r\nexceptions be described as one body, or sub-race, viz.: Dyaks. In general\r\nterms, a Dyak may be described as a Bornean semi-savage, of Malay\r\nextraction, with straight black hair, a yellowish brown complexion, and\r\nsmooth face of the Malay type. He is rather below medium stature, but\r\nathletic, and of active and warlike disposition. He is usually clad\r\nonly in a bark loin-cloth, but sometimes wears a sleeveless jacket, and\r\nparticularly in war, on which occasions it is made of skins or padded\r\ncloth. He is armed with sword and spear, and possibly the _sumpitan_ also\r\nfor blowing poisoned arrows. He invariably lives in the jungle, in a long\r\nhouse-village set up high on posts. Although he has no religion whatever,\r\nand worships nothing, he has profound regard for the rights of property,\r\nrespects his wife, and treats her and his children with the highest\r\nconsideration. His sustenance is rice, fowls, pigs and fruit grown by\r\nhimself, wild animals slain in the forest, and wild fruit, supplemented\r\nby a few things which he receives in exchange for wax, gum, rattans and\r\ngutta, although these are generally given for brass-wire, beads, cloth\r\nand other ornaments. He has no written languages, builds no monuments,\r\nmakes no pottery, and only one kind of coarse cloth, carves rather neatly\r\nin wood, and works but little in iron. His bearing is independent,\r\ndignified, respectful. He is a trustworthy friend, but a dangerous foe.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the aboriginal inhabitants of Borneo may be divided into\r\nfour great tribes: The Kyans, Mongol Dyaks, Land Dyaks and Sea Dyaks.\r\nThis classification differs very widely from any hitherto proposed.[K]\r\n\r\nThe Kyan tribe is numerically the greatest, probably exceeding a quarter\r\nof a million. They are less civilized than the other tribes, are\r\nexceedingly warlike and aggressive. They decapitate their slain enemies,\r\nand keep the cleaned skulls as trophies.\r\n\r\nThe Mongol Dyaks inhabit northeastern Borneo. They have been greatly\r\ninfluenced by contact with the Chinese, with whom they have intermarried.\r\nIn appearance they resemble the other Dyaks.\r\n\r\nThe Land Dyaks inhabit the country lying between the Sadong River and\r\nthe headwaters of the Sambas, extending southward to the Kapurce, and an\r\nunknown distance beyond. They live inland, and differ in certain customs\r\nfrom their neighbors, the Sea Dyaks. The Land Dyaks are the only people\r\nin Borneo who burn their dead. The warriors, though brave, are not fond\r\nof war for its own sake, nor are they possessed with an insatiable desire\r\nfor plunder, as are the Kyans, and formerly the Sea Dyaks also. Their\r\nsocial customs closely resemble those of the Sea Dyaks.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyaks consist of seven clans, and occupy all the territory\r\nbetween the Rejang and Sadong rivers, from the sea-coast southward to the\r\nKapurce. The Sarawak government estimates their number at 90,000, and the\r\nLand Dyaks at 35,000. The color of a typical Sea Dyak is dark brown, with\r\na strong tinge of yellow. His hair is long and of a glossy black, and\r\nfalls on his shoulders in graceful locks.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are happy and contented. Their wants are few, their diseases\r\nfewer, and their crimes fewer still. In hospitality, human sympathy and\r\ncharity, they are not outranked by any people living, as far as I know,\r\nand their morals are as much superior to ours as our intelligence is\r\nbeyond theirs. If happiness is the goal of human existence, the Dyak\r\nis much nearer to it than we. In this instance, at least, the highest\r\ncivilization has not evolved the most perfect state of society. Is it\r\npossible that man reaches his highest moral development in a state\r\nof savagery? Is it then really true that as we increase in civilized\r\nintelligence, our capacities and propensities for wickedness increase\r\nlikewise, and if so, will this always be the case with mankind?\r\n\r\n[K] For elaborate discussions of these tribes the reader must consult Mr.\r\nHornaday’s book, “Ten Years in the Jungle, with Rifle and Knife,” which\r\nhas been announced by its publishers, Messrs. Charles Scribner’s Sons, as\r\nnearly ready for circulation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am here because God has sent me to do a work that no other being could\r\ndo but myself. Had there not been room for me, God had not made me. Had I\r\nnot been needed in America, God had not placed me in America. Had I not\r\nwork in the nineteenth century, I had not been born.… I have a place—am\r\nsent of God on a mission, and if I perform it God shall acknowledge that\r\nI have done His will.—_From Sermons by Bishop Simpson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHAT-TO-DO CLUB.[L]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary village fails to get the best out of life. A candid\r\nexamination of average boys or girls of the town or country, brought\r\nup without the influence of outside advantages, too often reveals the\r\nfact that they are not, in refinement, in resources or in thought, the\r\nequal of city young people. There is a painful feeling that they are\r\nnarrow. Indeed, they feel this themselves, and complain that they have\r\n“no opportunities.” At the same time the narrow life does not shield them\r\nfrom temptation, and there are almost as many young men in America going\r\nto ruin under the narrowing influences of country and town life as in the\r\nwhirl of cities.\r\n\r\nAmong women the influence is evident. They are, it is true, largely free\r\nfrom the temptations of frivolity, extravagance and dissipation, but they\r\nare subject to temptations of no light weight. Their few interests lead\r\nthem to gossiping, prying and criticising. Lines of class distinction are\r\ndrawn so painfully tight that their lives become narrow in sympathies\r\nand associations. Very largely they lack independence of spirit to help\r\nthem dare untried lines of conduct. Many of our American villages and\r\n“corners” are the most trying places in the land in which to live. Few\r\ndare to try improvements, enthusiasm meets little or no response, ideas\r\ntravel slowly. Village life _looks_ ideal to one wearied by the rush and\r\nwickedness of a city, but there is in it a peculiarly benumbing influence\r\nwhich is all the more difficult to contend against because so silent in\r\nits action. Yet there are two of the best conditions for high living\r\nin the surroundings of town and country. There are leisure and quiet.\r\nAnything which will impregnate this rare life with enthusiasm and energy\r\nwill furnish the happiest conditions for noble action and steady growth.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy problem for a reformer in such a locality, but we\r\nbelieve Mrs. Campbell in her “What-to-do Club” offers a solution which\r\nwill rarely fail among girls and women. “The What-to-do Club” is an\r\nunpretending story, but it has a practical grip on this question. It\r\nintroduces us to a dozen or more village girls of varying ranks. One\r\nhas had superior opportunities; another exceptional training; two or\r\nthree have been “away to school;” some are farmers’ daughters; there\r\nis a teacher, two or three poor self-supporters—in fact, about such an\r\nassemblage as any town between New York and Chicago might give us. But\r\nwhile there is a large enough company to furnish a delightful coterie,\r\nthere is absolutely no social life among them. The differences in\r\ntheir opportunities they have exaggerated until they feel that their\r\ninterests are as unlike as those of Fijis and Bostonians. They look\r\nat each other with curiosity merely, and all of them are bored by the\r\ndullness of their lives. Mrs. Campbell puts a wise woman into their\r\nmidst. This woman’s experience has taught her that the barrier between\r\nwomen of different sets is largely their ignorance of each other, their\r\nbelief that they have nothing in common. She finds something in common\r\nfor these girls. By a little tact, exerted at a village gathering, she\r\ninterests them in herself. A second stroke of policy finds them gathered\r\nin her parlor and she clinches her work by giving them an insight into\r\npractical employments—not pleasures, mind you—but work, for women at\r\nhome. The interest excited quickens them all. They become alert, capable,\r\nquick-witted, and suddenly see in each other much of which they had\r\nnever before dreamed. The false barriers between women invariably fall\r\nbefore a common interest. Show them how strangely their minds and lives\r\nare alike and the sympathy of similarity makes friends of them. So the\r\ngirls of the “What-to-do Club” found, at any rate. Their meetings became\r\nvoyages of discovery. Their discoveries were El Dorados to many a one\r\nof their number perplexed by the want of pin-money, or worse still, of\r\nbread-money. Simple, practical, at-home occupations for leisure hours\r\nwas the first study, and it is marvelous what a number they found.\r\nOne young lady undertakes strawberry culture, and in a single season\r\nclears, off a quarter of an acre, $154.65. Better still, her vigorous\r\nout-of-door life transforms a pair of pale, hollow cheeks until they are\r\nrosy and plump, and awakens healthful interest which soon makes a happy\r\nheart out of a very discontented one. A half acre put into small fruits,\r\ncurrants, raspberries and blackberries, opens the way for an active young\r\nphilanthropist to start a fund for a future kindergarten for her father’s\r\nemployés. It does more. It opens the young lady’s eyes to the dignity of\r\nwork, puts a bond of sympathy between her and the people who work for\r\nher, and strengthens the common sense of her whole family. Our strawberry\r\ngirl tries poultry and finds it the most delightful of employments. It\r\npays her, too, one season’s work yielding a clear profit of $86.56 on\r\nan expenditure of $73.40. Bees, with their fascinating history, their\r\nexciting family affairs, their industrious honey making, and their clear,\r\nunfailing profit came in for one young Busybody’s attention, and in a\r\nsingle season this young merchant clears $113.94. One girl tries silk\r\nworms and sends to the club this report of her summer’s work:\r\n\r\n    One ounce of eggs                          $5 00\r\n    Fixtures for cocoonery                      5 00\r\n                                              ------\r\n                                              $10 00\r\n\r\n    36 pounds stifled cocoons at $1 per pound       $36 00\r\n                                                    ------\r\n        Profit                                      $26 00\r\n\r\nOne of the best discoveries which the club makes is of the possibilities\r\nin fruit canning, jelly making, and, best of all, fruit evaporating.\r\nLike “Dorothy” of the “club,” when we read of the wonders of the latter\r\nwe burned to “live in an orchard and evaporate everything that grows.”\r\nHow wonderful it seemed to these girls to whom fruit preserving had been\r\nbounded by the limits of the fruit closet and the demands of the table,\r\nto put up jelly for market, to “take in” canning for people too busy to\r\ndo their own, to dry fruit in that wonderful evaporator, which would sell\r\nin any market in the country.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that these new ideas put into their lives new\r\npossibilities. It showed them that there was something to do at home,\r\nsomething which was more than a paying employment. For these out-of-door\r\ninterests are more. They are health-giving, awakening pursuits. The\r\ngirl that engages in such enterprises wins more than a few dollars; she\r\ncultivates the business faculty and arouses a dormant independence which\r\nmakes a new creature out of her. This new interest in the lives of Mrs.\r\nCampbell’s girls gave them an interest, at first in purely money making\r\nenterprises, but it soon knit them into friends. Their friendship spread\r\nuntil they found themselves reading, studying, planning, as one body. The\r\ninfluence in the story energizes the community. It is, perhaps, quite\r\npossible that in a real club we might meet with more discouragements, but\r\nit is impossible that we fail entirely.\r\n\r\nTown and country need more improving, enthusiastic work to redeem them\r\nfrom barrenness and indolence. Our girls need a chance to do independent\r\nwork, to study practical business, to fill their minds with other\r\nthoughts than the petty doings of neighbors. A What-to-do Club is one\r\nstep toward higher village life. It is one step toward disinfecting a\r\nneighborhood of the poisonous gossip which floats like a pestilence\r\naround localities which ought to furnish the most desirable homes in our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[L] The What-to-do Club. A Story for Girls. By Helen Campbell. Boston:\r\nRoberts Brothers. 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICISMS.\r\n\r\nBY CHANCELLOR J. H. VINCENT, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle,” with the general\r\nChautauqua movement, has had its share of criticism. Its advantages have\r\nbeen pointed out, and sometimes magnified. Its managers have had their\r\nattention called to the dangers and defects of the system. Personally, I\r\nenjoy adverse criticism and the practical counsel which it has brought\r\nquite as much as words of praise, for praise may paralyze effort,\r\nwhile the goad of the critic is likely to stimulate both ingenuity and\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nThe members of the C. L. S. C. have from the beginning been encouraged to\r\nexpress freely to the Superintendent of Instruction their dissatisfaction\r\nwith either text-books or methods. As a result of this freedom, vigilance\r\nhas been promoted, and many improvements have been from time to time\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the C. L. S. C. are unique. The provision of text-books\r\nprecisely adapted to these unique aims has been one of the ever-present\r\nproblems. If our readers were children in the school room, and daily\r\nrecitations were practicable, it would be easy to find suitable\r\ntext-books on every subject in the curriculum. If these readers were\r\nchiefly high school or college graduates desiring advanced courses of\r\nreading, it would be comparatively easy to provide standard works written\r\nby specialists for specialists, and assuming on every page a large\r\nmeasure of knowledge already possessed by the reader. If it were the aim\r\nof the C. L. S. C. to study one subject at a time, and that for a long\r\ntime, exhaustively, from its alphabet to its “last word,” it would not be\r\ndifficult to find numerous text-books on that subject adapted to every\r\nvariety of capacity and attainment.\r\n\r\nThe C. L. S. C. is not, however, designed for school children, nor for\r\nadvanced readers, nor for specialists. It has enrolled but few names of\r\nmembers under eighteen years of age. Its members are “out of school.”\r\nIt rejoices in thousands of college graduates, but these take up its\r\nreadings not for advanced study as post-graduates, but to review under\r\nfavorable conditions the scholastic studies of former years, and in some\r\ncases, perchance, to make amends for carelessness and superficiality\r\nduring those years of unappreciated opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe C. L. S. C. is therefore a “school of reading at home” for college\r\ngraduates who desire, whatever the motive, to review the college\r\ncourse, and for people who, having been deprived of early educational\r\nopportunity, desire by a general course of reading to place themselves\r\nin sympathy with the school and college world; to know something of the\r\neducational courses now being pursued by their children; to test their\r\nown powers by a survey of the varied field of letters, and thus by our\r\nfour years’ superficial course of reading prepare for special studies\r\nfurther on. The C. L. S. C. aims to provide, therefore, first for the\r\nfour years’ general course, and afterward for the special studies.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the four years’ course is the usual college curriculum.\r\nWith this aim we began. To this aim we adhere. The success of the scheme\r\nin promoting intellectual quickening and activity has been attested by\r\nthousands who have tried it for several years.\r\n\r\nHere lies the chief cause of our embarrassment. It is difficult\r\nto provide books precisely adapted to the needs of our peculiar\r\nconstituency. The Superintendent of Instruction and the Counselors have\r\nfelt this from the beginning. Heavy and elaborate books discourage a\r\nclass which we are anxious to lure into the love of literature. Books\r\ntoo much abridged fail to satisfy more mature minds. Old books may be\r\nbehind the times, or, although acknowledged to be standards, may not\r\nfor the reasons above given be fully adapted to our readers. As for new\r\nbooks—every one knows how hard it is to secure them, and how easily a\r\nflippant criticism may destroy the confidence of the uninitiated in\r\nthem. Notwithstanding these embarrassments we have tried to do our best,\r\nproviding old books where the council could agree upon them, and new\r\nbooks where they seemed to be absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that any book, especially any new book, will\r\nmeet with universal approval. As for criticism—well, who knoweth the\r\nways of critics with the new books! Did not Samuel Taylor Coleridge say\r\nof Burke’s essay on “The Sublime and the Beautiful,” “It seems to me a\r\npoor thing?” Did not Horace Walpole call Goldsmith “an inspired idiot?”\r\nDid not Dr. Johnson pronounce Fielding a “blockhead?” Does not Hume\r\naffirm that “no page of Shakspere is without glaring faults?” Was not the\r\nmanuscript of Thackeray’s “Vanity Fair” rejected because the critic to\r\nwhom it was submitted pronounced it “without interest?”\r\n\r\nSome books of the C. L. S. C. have excited unfavorable\r\ncriticism—religious books by those who do not care to read religious\r\nbooks at all, and think it an impertinence to obtrude them upon the\r\ngeneral reader; certain scientific books because “not up to the times,”\r\nor the critic being himself a scientific specialist is certain that the\r\nviews of our specialist are “unsound.”\r\n\r\nConcerning one of the books on the list, a correspondent says:\r\n\r\n    “It is useless—worse than useless; it is harmful. Its style is\r\n    involved, obscure, bombastic, florid, ‘highfalutin’,’ diffuse,\r\n    disfigured by straining after effect, by the effort for fine\r\n    writing, and by many evil features carefully to be avoided.”\r\n\r\nI do not quote the above as a specimen of classic English, but as\r\nindicating the temper of the writer, whose letter is accompanied by\r\nnineteen manuscript pages of closely written criticisms upon the\r\ncondemned volume.\r\n\r\nConcerning this same book, a high authority in English to whom it was\r\nsubmitted, has said: “It is a clear, compact, and readable statement of\r\nthe laws and principles of speech.” A Boston writer of ability had said:\r\n“This little volume is the very best text-book for any one desiring to\r\nperfect himself in the laws and principles of speech. It is grammar,\r\nrhetoric and composition combined, and is doubly worth its price.” A\r\nPhiladelphia critic had said: “A better treatise could not be placed in\r\nthe hands of a student who has not been initiated into the intricacies\r\nwhich make prose composition an intolerable bore to the young.”\r\n\r\nOther and equally strong commendations of this book might be quoted,\r\ncommendations which were received from trustworthy authorities before\r\nit was placed on our list. I submitted the volume to one of the best\r\nliterary critics in the country, who called attention to some errors\r\nwhich needed correction. Owing to the illness of the author, or for\r\nsome other reason, his attention was not called to the corrections\r\nrequired, and therefore numerous minor defects, which would have been\r\ncarefully remedied by its competent and scholarly author, appeared in\r\nthe new edition. Dr. Johnson made six thousand alterations in the second\r\nedition of “The Rambler.” But for the oversight, for which I fear I must\r\nacknowledge myself responsible, the volume under consideration would have\r\nbeen thoroughly revised.\r\n\r\nMany local circles have as leaders men of literary ability and\r\nscholarship who, prepared for such wise service by the humility which\r\ncomes from years of educational experience, have pointed out these\r\ndefects, at the same time fairly representing the true value of the\r\nbook, and putting emphasis upon its admirable instructions which, by\r\nhyper-criticism, may have been lost sight of.\r\n\r\nConcerning another book on the course, a critic says:\r\n\r\n    “As a close student of the classics for years past, I must say\r\n    that I think there is very little scholarship displayed or\r\n    employed in Prof. Wilkinson’s work on Greek literature.… Further,\r\n    the arrangement is senseless, even harmful. Literature is a\r\n    growth, and largely the reflex of the people’s life and thought.\r\n    It must then be treated historically, and not in the topsy-turvy\r\n    fashion of Prof. Wilkinson.”\r\n\r\nThe same writer proposed another series of works on ancient Greek\r\nliterature, as a substitute for the two volumes of Prof. Wilkinson. The\r\nseries he proposed, however, contained an amount of matter which would\r\nprove utterly discouraging to our readers and which would cost ten times\r\nas much as the more condensed work of Dr. Wilkinson. Besides all this,\r\nthe work of Dr. Wilkinson meets the object of the C. L. S. C.\r\n\r\nWhen one gets into the world of criticism, he finds himself among\r\n“doctors” who “disagree.” I have quoted one view of Dr. Wilkinson’s\r\ntext-books, presented by our unknown critic. Now for another. Dr. Howard\r\nCrosby, of New York, a most finished scholar and close critic, and a\r\njudge of both English and Greek literature, says: “Dr. Wilkinson’s Greek\r\ncourse is clear, attractive, judicious in its treatment of the subject,\r\nand fills a valuable place in literature.” Of the second volume, the same\r\nscholar says: “The new volume is thoroughly attractive. It is fully up to\r\nthe high standard of the other.” Such commendation as this sustained our\r\nearliest judgment of the works in question. Prof. Frieze, of the Latin\r\nDepartment of the University of Michigan, says: “I have not yet seen the\r\n‘Preparatory Latin Course in English,’ though I was favored with a copy\r\nof the Greek. I have only to say that if the Latin equals the Greek it\r\ncan not fail to be a contribution to classical culture both for classical\r\nand English scholars, of very great value. I have been delighted with\r\na perusal of Prof. Wilkinson’s critical notices, his own translations,\r\nand his selections of the translations of others, and I sincerely\r\ncongratulate him on the admirable style in which he has presented the\r\nmatter, as well as the character of the matter itself, and the plan of\r\nthe whole work.”\r\n\r\nProf. A. C. Kendrick, D.D., head of the Department of Greek in the\r\nUniversity of Rochester, says:\r\n\r\n    “The plan of the work is quite unique, yet certainly adapted to\r\n    the wants of a large and increasing class of young persons in our\r\n    country. Its execution seems to me very felicitous; it is marked\r\n    by the taste and scholarship which were to be expected from its\r\n    accomplished author.”\r\n\r\nDr. Alvah Hovey, President of the Theological Institution, writes to Dr.\r\nWilkinson:\r\n\r\n    “In these latter days I do not often read a volume through from\r\n    beginning to end without omitting a chapter, paragraph, or\r\n    sentence. But I have read in this way your ‘Preparatory Greek\r\n    Course,’ simply because it is so instructive and captivating a\r\n    volume that I could not persuade myself to pass over any word of\r\n    it unread.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. A. P. Peabody, D.D., LL.D., late of Harvard University, writes:\r\n\r\n    “I have looked through Mr. Wilkinson’s ‘Preparatory Greek Course\r\n    in English,’ and am prepared to give it my warmest commendation.\r\n    It supplies a need which is more and more felt from year to\r\n    year, for two reasons, one for which I rejoice, the higher\r\n    standard of culture that prevails in society at large; the\r\n    other, inevitable, yet to me a subject of regret, the diminishing\r\n    disposition on the part of well-educated people to study the\r\n    classical languages.”\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Watchman_ adds to such commendations as the above the\r\nfollowing testimony:\r\n\r\n    “The plan is an ingenious one, and is carried out with spirit. It\r\n    need not be said that the fine literary taste and critical acumen\r\n    of Prof. Wilkinson are shown to much advantage. Only by a fair\r\n    trial can the practical worth of such a series be proved. We have\r\n    found pleasure in reading the volume.”\r\n\r\nIn suggesting to Dr. Wilkinson the idea of this “After-school Series,” I\r\nrequested him:\r\n\r\n1. To give in two volumes the substance of what the college boy in his\r\npreparatory and college course would learn of Greek literature—not the\r\nlanguage, but the literature;\r\n\r\n2. To put into his books as far as possible the method and spirit of\r\nthe college recitation room, discussing collateral topics, introducing\r\nbiographical and classical incidents, and employing illustrations from\r\nmodern life and literature; to put his individuality into the work, so\r\nthat teacher and pupils might be brought into friendly relations, and\r\nthus something of the animation and enthusiasm of the recitation room be\r\nenjoyed by solitary students.\r\n\r\nIt is Dr. Wilkinson’s attempt to realize this idea that produces the\r\nimpression upon one critic of the “uninstructive chattiness” of the\r\nauthor. To a man who has just spent eight years in the study of the\r\nclassics, and who makes them a specialty, there may be some things in Dr.\r\nWilkinson’s book which are not instructive; to people for whom the book\r\nwas written, there is not an uninstructive page in the book. Perfection\r\nin the recitation room may not be possible. Qualities in the _viva voce_\r\nteacher which attract and delight and benefit one student may not so\r\nfavorably impress, and may sometimes almost annoy, another. A member of\r\nthe Circle writes (in reference, no doubt, to Dr. Wilkinson’s book): “One\r\nauthor frequently converses, as it were, with the reader, telling him in\r\na friendly way of the many things he will relate after a while.… The book\r\nhas caused the Circle to be ridiculed, and I could not think it was not\r\nwithout cause.”\r\n\r\nI can readily see how a college graduate, just released from the\r\nrecitation room, with lofty ideals of scholarship, and with really a vast\r\namount of knowledge, might depreciate with a tone of contempt such a work\r\nas that of Dr. Wilkinson. I can see, too, how that smile of contempt from\r\na scholar with local reputation might annoy and afflict less cultivated\r\npeople belonging to a local circle who, devoted to an institution, are\r\nanxious that it and its text-books should receive the commendation\r\nof cultivated men. Just such commendation Dr. Wilkinson’s books have\r\nreceived. There may be now and then a slight tone of “chattiness.” There\r\nmay be too frequent “forecasting of plan and purpose,” but on the whole\r\nthe Professor’s work is admirably done, and has received the unqualified\r\napproval of our best students, men and women of the highest culture,\r\neminent professors of Greek and Latin who fully understand and appreciate\r\nthe aim of the author. I can assure my correspondent that there is\r\nnothing in Dr. Wilkinson’s books to cause the Circle or the books to be\r\n“ridiculed” by any true scholar.\r\n\r\nA recent university graduate, and I have no doubt a brilliant scholar,\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n    “I wonder if it is safe to hint that, while the Chautauqua Idea\r\n    is a noble and praiseworthy one, it is possible that the working\r\n    out of the Idea may be defective?… When the members of the Circle\r\n    read so faithfully the works prescribed, giving in many cases\r\n    time that can ill be spared, it is but just that the very best\r\n    should be given them to study, that alone will be of profit to\r\n    the members, and help them to grow.”\r\n\r\nThe same writer pleads for “vigorous supervision by scholars and\r\nauthorities on the respective subjects as the only thing that will enable\r\nthe Chautauqua Idea to be carried out in a way that will help, and make\r\nthem better and stronger in thought and life.”\r\n\r\nThis sentiment meets my heartiest approval. Indefatigably and\r\nconscientiously have the Superintendent of Instruction and the Counselors\r\nsought to do this very work for the readers who seek their direction.\r\n\r\nIt would surprise our friends to examine our budget of criticisms _pro_\r\nand _con_, from all classes of people; from public school teachers,\r\ncollege professors, ministers, post-graduates, classicists, scientists,\r\nso called “self-made men,” and people who, professing to know almost\r\nnothing, seek advice and offer counsel. We have diligently sought to\r\nprofit by the things which have been said.\r\n\r\nOur readers must see the difficulties which encompass us; the wide\r\ndiversity of opinion concerning certain books, and the impossibility of\r\nsecuring works which will receive universal approval.\r\n\r\nThere are persons who do not believe in popular education at all. A\r\nrecent correspondent, a man of immense wealth, wrote: “Mechanics and\r\nsewing women should confine themselves to industrial education, and not\r\naspire to the knowledge of literature and art.” Would it be possible to\r\nproduce works on literature and art for the people which a man of that\r\ntype could approve?\r\n\r\nAn author of some pretensions, without much reputation in literary lines,\r\ntried to place a work of his own on the list of the C. L. S. C. _in lieu_\r\nof one on the same subject already adopted. Failing to win a place for\r\nhis own, he proceeded in another book savagely to criticise the preferred\r\nvolume. Would it be possible for this disappointed author to approve any\r\nbook on his specialty that might be placed upon our course?\r\n\r\nA certain youthful professor in an American college sneered at the idea\r\nof anybody enjoying the poetry of Homer or of Virgil unless he could\r\nread it in the original. Would it be possible for this literary fop to\r\nappreciate the books which seek to present the best thoughts of the old\r\nauthors in classic English?\r\n\r\nDear fellow-student: Feel free to offer criticisms which may be helpful\r\nto the Board of Counsel. We do not modify our policy for every criticism\r\nreceived. But we weigh conscientiously and carefully all that is said in\r\nfavor of or against the prescribed books. From year to year our course\r\nhas been modified. I stand ready at all times to accept the best books;\r\nto abandon the best we have for anything better that may be placed within\r\nour reach. And as our experience broadens, helpful criticisms multiply,\r\nand authors understand our peculiar needs, we shall approach more and\r\nmore nearly to the ideals which now shine above us.\r\n\r\nDo not, I beseech you, fail to protest against false, querulous and\r\nimpertinent criticisms, and against that hyper-criticism which delights\r\nin nothing so much as in pointing out faults and defects, losing sight of\r\nthe great things in excessive eagerness to detect slight inaccuracies.\r\n\r\nRemember that no book is placed upon the course that does not have the\r\npersonal approval of the best critics, and remember, moreover, that it\r\nwill never be possible to provide a book which is above criticism. As one\r\nof our Counselors writes:\r\n\r\n    “Good books have always been criticised upon some points\r\n    adversely. Plato freely criticises Homer. Quintilian criticises\r\n    Cicero. Cicero criticises Demosthenes. Addison criticises Milton.\r\n    And in each instance no doubt real faults were pointed out. The\r\n    most enlightened French critics used to pooh-pooh Shakspere. They\r\n    did likewise with Dante.”\r\n\r\nCollege students, with all their admiration for the professors under whom\r\nthey moved through four years of study, have some foibles and defects to\r\nreport and laugh at; but on the whole they honor the men who made them\r\nand led them. The authors of our text-books are our professors. On the\r\nwhole they have done their work well. It is proper to note their faults\r\nand avoid them, but in defending them, and in being proud of them, and in\r\nrejoicing in the course of reading which they have provided, we have the\r\nendorsement of wise, scholarly and experienced educators.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us learn the characteristics of the true critic, and\r\naccording to the measure of our ability let us seek to possess them:\r\n\r\n“A critic must have breadth, accuracy, sympathy, reverence, and love. He\r\nmust have no partialities, and no aversions. He must not be captious, but\r\njust.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE AND PROGRAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF REQUIRED READINGS FOR JUNE.\r\n\r\n_First Week_ (ending June 8).—1. “The Mechanism of English,” in THE\r\nCHAUTAUQUAN.\r\n\r\n2.

The\r\nquestions must be asked in such a way that the reply can be “yes,” “no,”\r\nor “I don’t know.” The company who can not guess rightly before the\r\ntwentieth question is to be considered dull.\r\n\r\n“Throwing Light” is also interesting. One of the party begins to tell\r\na story, concealing all names.

A member of the class of ’87, writing from ROME,\r\nITALY, says: “I think the course for this year particularly interesting,\r\nespecially for our party, which is to spend the spring months among the\r\nruins of that noble capital, Athens.” The reading our friend has been\r\ndoing has recommended itself to her foreign friends, who have made many\r\ninquiries about the course of reading, even wishing to be enrolled as\r\nmembers of our great Circle. The teacher over seas, like the tourist,\r\nfinds benefit in the work. A member of the class of ’83, writing from\r\nBULGARIA, says: “The time from six to seven in the morning is all that\r\nI can spare from my other work, but it makes the day brighter to begin\r\nit in this way, and so I read and study and think, and get charming\r\nglimpses of home circles. _Next year_ I mean to have a circle here, and\r\nhope to know enough of the language to put some of the best things into\r\nBulgarian.”\r\n\r\nOn the home side of the Atlantic, circle life seems to be vigorous and\r\ngrowing. The organizations of past years hold to the work, and many new\r\nfields are opened monthly. At BROCKVILLE, ONTARIO, the “Island City”\r\nbranch of thirteen members was organized last October. A simple but very\r\neffective method of work has been followed, that of appointing examiners\r\non each subject, different members being appointed from time to time, so\r\nthat all may be kept interested. They have had for president a college\r\ngraduate to help them over tough places in their classics, and a\r\npractical chemist is proving the marvels of chemistry to them.\r\n\r\nLIVERPOOL, NOVA SCOTIA, sends an encouraging word of the progress of\r\ntheir circle, formed in 1883, and now boasting twelve active members. The\r\nplan for the evening’s work in this circle is very good. Introductory\r\nexercises of prayer, minutes of last meeting, roll call, responded to\r\nby quotations, and a select reading, precede the evening drill, which\r\nis an informal conversation on one or more of the C. L. S. C. studies,\r\nconducted by a leader.——We quite agree with our friend at NIAGARA, who\r\nthinks that Chautauquans ought to know that there are other places in\r\nONTARIO beside Toronto where circles are doing good work, and that their\r\ntown is one of them. If all the Ontario towns have as bright and brave\r\ncircles as Niagara, we most certainly hope we shall hear from them.\r\n“In December, 1882,” so their history runs, “we formed a triangle,\r\nwith angles of various degrees of acuteness or obtuseness, but did not\r\ncommence work till January, and being three months behind time we found\r\nthe work rather heavy, but in proof of our zeal can report that not one\r\nof us that year ever missed any of our fortnightly meetings. In October,\r\n1883, we were joined by another member, not less acute, and ‘stood\r\nfour-square to all the winds that blow.’ We expected to form a real\r\ncircle, with all our angularities smoothed off, but find ourselves this\r\nyear with the original three, but from sickness and other reasons have\r\nhad our meetings sadly broken in upon, so that we need to use our motto,\r\n‘Never be discouraged.’ So far we have all enjoyed the work. We all lead\r\nbusy lives, without our Chautauqua studies, but we hope that they will\r\ngive to our lives sweetness and strength, and breadth and power. Many\r\nof us have done more reading each year than the course, but then such\r\nreading is apt to be desultory, and the fact of studying with others\r\ngives greater interest. We have generally kept the memorial days, and we\r\nall hope to visit Chautauqua some time.”\r\n\r\nA step has been taken in western MAINE to form a Chautauqua association.\r\nAUBURN, LEWISTOWN and adjoining towns have many members of the C. L. S.\r\nC. In March a meeting was held in Auburn, and after a banquet a motion\r\nwas passed providing for an associated circle of all the C. L. S. C.s of\r\nWestern Maine. True to the Chautauqua instinct, they are going to have\r\na summer meeting. MARANOCOOK is the chosen place, and June is the time.\r\nWestern Maine Chautauquans have the hearty good wishes of us all for a\r\ndelightful summer session. At their March meeting, these friends passed a\r\njust and appreciative resolution of gratitude to Chancellor Vincent for\r\nthe happy thought that conceived the Chautauqua Idea, and the untiring\r\nand well directed zeal that has made it so efficient.——At WOODFORDS,\r\nMAINE, the “Arlington” circle of fourteen members held twenty-five\r\nmeetings during the winter. Such zealous work justifies their claim that\r\nthey possess the “enchanted number” for a circle. The Arlington proposes\r\na parlor entertainment for a near day.\r\n\r\nGREENLAND N. H. has two very strong Chautauqua organizations, the\r\n“Baketel” circle and the “Spare Minute Class.” Founder’s Day was\r\ncelebrated with great _éclat_ by these warm admirers of Chancellor\r\nVincent. A public meeting was held in the town hall, with exercises\r\nof song, recitation, reading and tableaux. The last tableau was so\r\ncharacteristic it deserves a description. It was “The Chautauquans at\r\nHome,” and represented the entire local circle and spare minute class at\r\nwork. One was rocking the cradle and reading, another was at the ironing\r\ntable with an open book, and several were sewing and studying at the same\r\ntime. A happy close to the evening was a presentation to the honored\r\npresident of the circle, the Rev. O. S. Baketel, of an elegant easy chair.\r\n\r\nAmong the senior circles it is pleasant to be able to count in that of\r\nNORTH GROTON, N. H. The secretary says: “The ‘Angle’ has kept silent\r\nsince 1882, thinking that only two was a small number to report as a\r\nlocal circle, yet all this time we have met at every opportunity, for\r\nreading and questioning. We had long wished for guidance in home study,\r\nand the ‘course’ was eagerly taken as soon as heard of. This year two\r\nearnest ’88s have joined us. With us ‘Chautauqua has come to stay.’\r\n‘For,’ as Dr. Vincent said at Framingham, ‘goals yet grander wait our\r\nwinning on the mountains by and by.’”\r\n\r\nAnd now we have a nautical circle. The first mate, so we imagine, has\r\nsent us notes from the log-book, running over their whole course. Perhaps\r\ntheir sailing may guide another crew: “We have read in THE CHAUTAUQUAN,\r\nfrom month to month, many interesting reports from local circles, which\r\nhave been like fresh breezes to our own sails. One would judge from\r\nreading that _success_ was stamped upon _all_ methods of circle work.\r\nWe have thought sometimes that a part of the unwritten history of such\r\nwork might be helpful. We suspect that—way back in the annals—some things\r\nwere undertaken that did not turn out just right, and a few chapters from\r\nout that experience might save many a small boat from going to pieces in\r\ndangerous waters. In general, the ‘Vincent’ circle, of WEST BRATTLEBORO,\r\nVERMONT, has had fair sailing from port to port, set down on the C. L. S.\r\nC. line of travel. Four years ago a few of us began floating, not knowing\r\nenough ourselves of whither we were bound, to give a general invitation\r\nfor ‘all aboard.’ At last, reinforced, we tried to go in two separate\r\nboats, which kept just near enough together, and just far enough apart,\r\nto render such a division of the crew unnecessary, to say the least.\r\nOne year we failed to set sail soon enough, and came in late at every\r\nport. This year we make one crew, under one efficient captain, a few\r\nonly compelled by circumstances, or preferring to go in their own little\r\nskiffs. October 1, 1884, we set sail, and made directly for the shores\r\nof Greece. Landing under the direction of two well chosen generals, we\r\nscattered to spy out the land, bringing in such reports as we were able,\r\nat the time appointed. On the evening of November 3d we gathered to do\r\nreverence to the memory of one who had wished us ‘Godspeed.’ About that\r\ntime experiments in chemistry furnished us with illumination. Since the\r\nobservance of that memorial day, we have known that we were still landed\r\nupon the shores of Greece, but reports concerning the country and its\r\npeople, past and present, have been few, for finding ourselves in danger\r\nof forgetting, rather never having known, our ‘mother tongue,’ we have\r\nspent some time in practice of the ‘art of speech,’ and, loyal to our\r\nnative land, we have observed some of its festivals, and repeated to each\r\nother words from those we all delight to honor.”\r\n\r\nFor faithful work few circles can exceed that in FRANKLIN, MASS. The\r\ncircle numbers sixty-six members, nineteen of them being of the class\r\nof ’88. Meetings are held fortnightly. Not one regular meeting has\r\nbeen omitted since October 1, 1883. The president, although pastor\r\nof a large church, has been absent but five times since the circle\r\nwas formed—November, 1882. The work done at these meetings is solid\r\nreview of past readings. “Founder’s Day” was observed by accepting an\r\ninvitation from the “Star” circle, FOXBORO, MASS., to visit them and\r\nengage in a “Question Match” on Greek History, after which a bountiful\r\ncollation was served, and a social time enjoyed by all. Each heart felt\r\ngrateful to Chancellor Vincent for the C. L. S. C.——At ROCKPORT, MASS.,\r\nthe circle has fallen from fifteen to five, but the five faithful seem\r\nto enjoy their work too well to need any commiserating. They are so\r\ninterested in their studies they actually don’t realize they have grown\r\nsmaller—a method of taking things which removes the stings from all\r\nfalls in fortune. The “Granite” circle turns each alternate meeting into\r\na Round-Table, and finds that the plan works capitally. The circle is\r\nanticipating the pleasure of going in a body to Framingham Assembly this\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS is the banner State again. At COCHESETT twenty-four members\r\nform a circle of “Plymouth Rocks.” The Longfellow memorial was their\r\nfirst experience with special days; a successful experiment, too, we\r\njudge, for they have decided to continue the plan for the remainder of\r\nthe year. Cochesett is an Assembly offspring—a child of Framingham, which\r\ngave the first interest to its zealous founder.——The “Philomaths,” of NEW\r\nBEDFORD, send greetings to all our fraternity. Since their reorganization\r\nin October the circle has resolved itself into groups of six or seven,\r\nwhich hold weekly round-tables for thorough study.——It is wonderful what\r\nenormous interest some circles get on their investments. Here is the\r\n“Bryant,” of WORCESTER, MASS., actually making 100 per cent. in less\r\nthan two years. In the fall of 1883 they began with twenty members,\r\nto-day they number forty. Is it far-fetched to attribute something of\r\ntheir success to the “question basket,” which forms an important part\r\nof their program?——The “Alphas,” thirty-two in number, of ATTLEBOROUGH,\r\nsend us some capital hints for our programs. At a Greek evening recently,\r\nten of their number were selected to give brief descriptions of Greek\r\nheroes—the rest of the company guessed the hero described. A half hour\r\nwas also spent at the Mardigras, and a friend, fresh from the carnival\r\nscenes, described his experiences among the merry masqueraders. At an\r\nhour of electrical experiments a very happy device was exhibited recently\r\nbefore the circle. The electricity played over tin-foil, with grooves\r\nan eighth of an inch apart, and through a stencil-like arrangement\r\nshowed to the surprise of the circle the illuminated letters, “C. L.\r\nS. C.”——_The Saturday Union_, of LYNN, MASS., is doing most effective\r\nwork for the Chautauquans of its vicinity, and a strong body of workers\r\nit has to serve. By a late issue we notice that there are in the\r\ncity six circles, and the list of Chautauquans, which appears with\r\ntheir residences in the same paper, includes 114 names. This “goodly\r\ncompanie” has given a course of lectures this winter; the seventh in\r\nthe course was on “Electricity”—and by a lady who, we are happy to say,\r\nillustrated her talk by apparatus of her own making. Our Chautauqua\r\nwomen! How proud we are growing of their ability, their pluck, their\r\nwomanliness!——NORTH BROOKFIELD’S circle has recently been favored by a\r\npoem on “The Chautauqua Idea,” also by a woman.——It would be unjust to\r\nallow a mistake, which found its way into last month’s “Local Circles,”\r\nto go uncorrected. At the Longfellow celebration held by the Chautauquans\r\nof Boston and vicinity, there were five hundred instead of fifty persons\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer of the “Hall on the Hill” to be erected at Framingham\r\nthis year, paid a well deserved compliment to the “Clio” circle, of\r\nPROVIDENCE, R. I., when he said that he wished there were more circles\r\nlike the “Clio.” These energetic friends took Chancellor Vincent at his\r\nword last summer, when he promised to lecture for any circle which would\r\npledge $200 to the “Hall on the Hill.” They raised the money, had their\r\nlecture, and are satisfied. Their hard work seems to have only whetted\r\ntheir intellectual appetites, for they have had a long list of brilliant\r\ntalks by distinguished men in addition to regular circle work. By the\r\nway, the New England branch of the class of ’87 was to hold a meeting\r\nin Providence in April, and the “Clio” was to act as hostess. What was\r\ndone? A Providence neighbor of the “Clio” is the “Channing” circle of\r\ntwenty-five members. We notice that these Providence friends use a very\r\npretty and appropriate heading on their letter paper. At the top of the\r\nsheet, in the corners, appear the names of president, vice president and\r\nsecretary, and below “Headquarters of the Channing Circle of the C. L. S.\r\nC.”\r\n\r\nA party of DANBURY, CONN., Chautauquans went abroad one night not long\r\nago to see “Athens in the Golden Age.” A delightful time these tourists\r\nhad. They made the passage of the Mediterranean Sea, and at Athens\r\nvisited the Acropolis, went to the Areopagus to listen to Pericles,\r\ncalled on Xantippe, and did a hundred more interesting things, at last\r\ncoming home via “Plymouth Rock.” The “Nestors,” however, do much beside\r\ntravel. They have an excellent method of working the question box, which\r\nis an inevitable part of their program. The questions are gathered just\r\nbefore adjournment, and shuffled, each member drawing one. The first\r\nexercise after roll call at the next meeting is the answering of these\r\nqueries. The imaginary trips which our Danbury friends like so well,\r\nthe “Alpha” circle, of NORWICH, makes a part of each evening’s work.\r\nWhen they journeyed from Boston to New York they went with Howells in a\r\n“Sleeping Car.” They have lived over, on paper, all the preparations for\r\nthe trip abroad, the life on the steamer, and have done the sight-seeing\r\nof the British Isles. These tourists have enlivened their travels by many\r\na happy device. Once it was a _conversazione_, and again, in preparation,\r\nperhaps, for their visit to Athens, a pronouncing match on Greek proper\r\nnames. What wonder they have had a phenomenal growth! Last year there was\r\nnot a circle in Norwich, now there are six. When the “Alpha” organized\r\nlast fall, it was with eleven members, to-day they have fifty. Nothing to\r\nbe surprised at, perhaps. It seems to have been “good growing weather”\r\nfor the C. L. S. C., throughout New England.——MERIDEN, CONN., has had\r\nthe common experience, the circle having increased to sixty-six members.\r\nThey have found the key to the mastery of the Greek names and chemical\r\nterms. The pronouncing matches have unlocked the doors and the fortunate\r\nMeridenites are able to talk glibly on their Grecian rambles. A second\r\ncircle, “Hanging Hills Class,” was organized last fall in Meriden. It has\r\ngrown to twenty members, who are doing superior work. This class observed\r\nLongfellow’s Day appropriately. The ’89 outlook must be very promising in\r\nMeriden.——“A small twig of the great New England branch,” the “Endeavor,”\r\nof STRATFORD, calls itself, and a healthy fruit-bearing twig, if small,\r\nwe should call any circle that can double its membership, as it has done,\r\nin less than a year.\r\n\r\nA splendid move has been made by the Chautauquans of NEW YORK CITY. The\r\ncircles had never united there for public work until, April 9th, after\r\na deal of planning and much labor the various local circles in the\r\ncity, with one from JERSEY CITY, held a public meeting at the Broadway\r\nTabernacle. Chancellor Vincent was secured to deliver the address. A\r\nlarge and enthusiastic audience, numbering about 1,200 persons, was\r\npresent. “School after School, or the Every-day College” was the theme\r\nof the address. The friends who had prepared the meeting were more\r\nthan jubilant over the way the interesting lecture “took” among their\r\nguests, and declared that though some of them had long been members\r\nof the C. L. S. C. all of them received new vistas of the work. After\r\nthe lecture the Chancellor held a reception, at which the members of\r\nthe following New York circles were received by him: The “Garfield,”\r\n“Irving,” “Unique,” “Spare Moment,” “Central,” “Park Avenue,” and the\r\n“Round-Table,” of Jersey City.——BROOKLYN has a “Pierian” spring, at\r\nwhich twenty-five devotees of the muses “drink deep” and joyously.\r\nEssays, debates, recitations, quizzes, poems, and chemical experiments\r\nare the draughts these friends draw from their well. So happy are\r\nthey in their festivities that another year they hope to see a sister\r\nwelling up by their side.——At RANDALL’S ISLAND, NEW YORK CITY, there\r\nis one of those steady, hard-working circles, which by their fruits so\r\nfavorably impress the people who watch them. The “Excelsior” has been in\r\nexistence for two years and has a roll of seventeen persons. A program\r\nfull of good points is carried out at their regular sessions, which are\r\ninterrupted only by Memorial services. The secretary finds, he writes,\r\nthat the influence and example in regard to Chautauqua work is shown\r\nby an increased attendance and membership.——When circles increase in\r\ngeometrical ratio—and a little over—year after year, it is not strange\r\nthat a time should come when the leader inquires “What _shall_ we do?”\r\nAt GLENS FALLS four graduates, eleven ’86s, twenty-three Pansies, and\r\nfifty-nine Plymouth Rocks—ninety-seven in all—form the circle. It is\r\nan unwieldy number to study together, but, writes the secretary, “We\r\nare fearful that division into smaller circles will greatly lessen the\r\nmembership. We are considering for next year this plan: We shall have our\r\ngeneral meetings as at present and encourage the formation of sections\r\nfor special meetings, making the leaders of the sections, together with\r\nthe officers of the general circle, an executive committee.” The plan is\r\ngood, and if the monthly joint meetings are made “state occasions,” there\r\nwill be but little danger of the sections losing ground.——At TROY the\r\nmonthly meetings are conducted in an admirable way—not one of the least\r\nof the secrets of their success is their habit of sending out cards with\r\nthe program, and some such stirring word as this:\r\n\r\n    “We hope every member will be prepared with some facts on No. 6\r\n    [“No. 6” was a _conversazione_ on “Our Territories”]. Let us make\r\n    it a success. Our whole course is highly remunerative to one who\r\n    reads. Make your hours count for profit. We have all the time\r\n    there is. Not everything that comes to us and asks a little of\r\n    our time should be granted audience or gratification.”\r\n\r\nA similar plan is followed by the “Mettowee” circle, of GRANVILLE, N. Y.\r\nA “Round-Table” on a recent program was, “What we have seen (mentally or\r\notherwise) during the past week.” If the Glens Falls people will make\r\ntheir monthly meetings big enough to arouse the pride of the members\r\nof the section, the result will not be doubtful.——SHUSHAN, N. Y., has\r\ntwo circles. The younger of the two is reported as “fast becoming one\r\nof the fixed and instructive institutions of the village,” a state that\r\nthe three-year-old circle of DEANSVILLE is already in, we surmise,\r\nfrom the report of the work of its membership. The Deansville circle\r\nholds an annual public meeting, at which an entertainment is provided\r\nand refreshments served. Preparations are being made for this year’s\r\nmeeting.——A “Crescent” has appeared in KNOXBORO since the year 1885\r\nbegan. Though so late in beginning that they are obliged to devote almost\r\nall their time to the readings, and are too busy to prepare elaborate\r\nprograms, the interest has not flagged since the start. The “Crescent”\r\nhas ten members.——SYRACUSE has always been one of the most interesting\r\nof the local centers of the C. L. S. C. Their graduates, of whom one is\r\nthe genial Secretary of Chautauqua, Mr. W. A. Duncan, have organized a\r\nchapter of the “S. H. G.” They propose to hold monthly meetings, and to\r\npursue one of the special courses of study. The membership of this new\r\nclass is eleven now, and there will be yearly “more to follow.”——The\r\n“Philomathean,” of LANCASTER, N. Y., opening with 10 members, has\r\ngrown to fifteen beside honorary and local members. Constant variety\r\nin programs, no “set way,” and hard work have been the maxims of their\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe “Broadway” circle, of CAMDEN, N. J., puts in after a program of\r\nremarkably good timber, and the outline of their thorough organization,\r\nthis healthy testimony: “‘Broadway’ circle is busily engaged in promoting\r\nthis home study, and the older we grow the more we are able to discern\r\nthe many blessings derived from it; the more we read and study the books\r\nthe more does it stimulate our interest and thirst for knowledge.”——At\r\nPHILLIPSBURG, N. J., the circle has met this year with a sad loss in\r\nthe death of Mrs. F. B. Holbert. Mrs. Holbert was a member of the class\r\nof ’84, the president of the circle in Phillipsburg at the time of her\r\ndeath, and a most zealous friend of the C. L. S. C. To her the circle\r\nat Phillipsburg owes its existence.——At BRIDGEPORT a circle of eight\r\nwas organized in October, 1884. A faithful leader has helped to keep\r\nthem interested and alive, and already they write that a taste for solid\r\nreading has been acquired by the members.——A local circle has been\r\norganized at EAST ORANGE, with eighteen members. The favorite name,\r\n“Alpha,” has been given the class. One of their late meetings of unusual\r\ninterest was the celebration of Longfellow’s birthday, at which, among\r\nother exercises, we notice what must have been a particularly pleasing\r\nnumber, “The Better Land,” illustrated by tableaux.\r\n\r\nThe genial, kindly associations of circles are one of their greatest\r\ncharms. How the kindly attention, the pleasant surprises kindle the\r\nhearts and knit the affections! CARLISLE, PA., circle has recently\r\nexperienced all the delight of doing one of these pleasant deeds. The\r\nbirthday of their president, Dr. Whitney, was celebrated by a genuine\r\nsurprise. A game of chess at a neighbor’s was the bait which enticed\r\nhim from home, where, on his return, the Chautauquans of his circle,\r\nthirty-one strong, greeted him with good cheer and good wishes. It\r\npays to slip into our Chautauqua life many of these pleasant little\r\naffairs.——Several notices of Longfellow celebrations held by PENNSYLVANIA\r\ncircles reached us too late for the May issue of THE CHAUTAUQUAN. At\r\nBETHLEHEM, where there is a “thoroughly congenial” circle of ten, the day\r\nwas appropriately observed. This circle has found a scheme of study which\r\nit reports works very well for them. The time from 7:30 to 10:00 p. m. on\r\nthe evening of meeting is divided into half-hour periods. These periods\r\nare all but one devoted to quizzes on the subjects laid down in THE\r\nCHAUTAUQUAN outline, the extra period being given to a discussion of the\r\nworks of some well known author.——At PITTSBURGH the “Hiawatha” observed\r\nthe day with an excellent program, carried out before many friends. This\r\ncircle—fifteen in number—is one of last fall’s harvest. Their motto,\r\n“Bound to Win,” tells the stuff they’re made of.——The wide-awake circle\r\nat NEW WILMINGTON, PA., prepared a program covering Founder’s day, and\r\nLongfellow’s, and reported a “royal good time” for their trouble. There\r\nare twenty-four members in the circle; their unanimous verdict is: “The\r\nC. L. S. C. has been a source of intellectual growth to us. And we have\r\nbeen led by it to take a wider view of the possibilities of life.”——A\r\nvery good program of a Longfellow service comes from PLYMOUTH. We notice\r\nan analytical study among the numbers, and would commend such services to\r\nthe circles as particularly profitable.——The LOCK HAVEN circle, at its\r\nLongfellow evening, paid a high compliment to the circle at RENOVO, by\r\nreading the program carried out by the latter on a previous evening, and\r\nsending their greetings and congratulations to the Renovo Chautauquans,\r\nthat they have grown so strong and enthusiastic in but one year’s\r\nreadings.——We are always sorry to miss in geography, but we will “own\r\nup;” we did in the April issue. The “Golden Flower” is not a Tennessee,\r\nbut a Pennsylvania blossom, and HATBORO is a Keystone town. The “Golden\r\nFlower” has sent a series of really model programs recently.——From a\r\nfriend at GILMORE, PA., we learn of the “Foster Brook” circle. This\r\nclass was organized in October, 1882, with twenty-one members, but in\r\na few months its course was rudely broken by the death of one of their\r\nyoung but zealous members, Mr. Henry Howe, of the class of ’86. The work\r\nwas again taken up, but February, ’84, Mr. H. F. Howe, father of the\r\nformer, and a member of the same class, was laid away by the side of his\r\nson. Though so tried by sorrow our friends have bravely followed their\r\nwork, saddened, yet rejoicing.——It is an experience that many circles\r\nhave, we imagine, this of the TUNKHANNOCK circle, of finding that their\r\nsecond year’s reading goes much more easily than the first, and that\r\nthey have time for many things in their circle which once they did not\r\nhave. One good thing that the “Tunkhannock” occasionally slips in is\r\nimportant items of news from the secular press.——The “Mountaineers,” of\r\nCLEARFIELD, is one of the many, many circles brought into the field by\r\nChancellor Vincent’s kindling fervor. It is an ’88 circle, and numbers\r\nfifteen members. Reviews, readings, and conversation supplement the\r\nprograms of THE CHAUTAUQUAN. The reviews, particularly, they have found\r\nvaluable. Each book is taken up after being read, questions made out\r\non it, and answers given by the circle. Outlines of the books are also\r\nsometimes prepared. This latter plan we do not remember to have noticed\r\nin the reports before, but we know it to be a very effective method for\r\nreviewing the facts or arguments in a book.——We rarely open our monthly\r\nbudget of letters without finding a WASHINGTON, D. C., representative.\r\nThis month we have a program from the “Wesley Chapel” circle, a good\r\none, of course, like all the Chautauqua work done in Washington. An\r\ninteresting item on it is “The Public Buildings of Athens,” illustrated\r\nby photographs.\r\n\r\nA MIDDLETOWN, MD., letter suggests a new way of managing a local circle.\r\n“We are the ‘Mayflower’ circle, numbering five,” our friend writes, “As\r\nwe are active members of a literary society, which meets weekly, we\r\nhave no circle meetings, but talk over our readings, and Chautauqua in\r\ngeneral, when opportunities offer. We are earnest and interested, and\r\nexpect to enter upon next year’s work with increased knowledge, zeal, and\r\nnumbers.”\r\n\r\nA bed of KENTUCKY Pansies is filling all the air of HARDINSBURG with\r\nsweetest fragrance. “Of all the red letter days in our circle calendar,”\r\nwrites one of them, “Longfellow’s day is the brightest. We send you a\r\nprogram of our last celebration, and a delightful evening we had carrying\r\nit out. A year ago we thought we could not have another Longfellow’s\r\nevening as pleasant as was that. We feel assured that the evening just\r\npassed was more nearly what such an evening should be. In looking back\r\nfrom this standpoint upon the past year, we are inspired for renewed\r\nenergies and work for the years to come.”——Another Pansy of Kentucky,\r\nfrom BEWLEYVILLE, writes: “The C. L. S. C. has been of immense benefit\r\nto me. My irregular habits of study and desultory reading, instead of\r\nstrengthening, had enervated my mind.… My CHAUTAUQUAN and books are a\r\ngreat source of pleasure to some of my acquaintances who are not pursuing\r\nthe course.”\r\n\r\nCHILLICOTHE, OHIO, has, in the Walnut Street M. E. Church, an\r\nenthusiastic band of twenty-two workers, who report themselves as\r\n“progressing finely.” At a recent meeting a lecture on the “Art of\r\nSpeech,” by the able Episcopalian rector of the city, was greatly enjoyed\r\nby the class.\r\n\r\nIt must be that a millennium has reached the circle of ERIE, MICHIGAN. If\r\nthere is another circle in the country that can say as much, we should\r\nlike to know where they are and how they do it. The Eries are forty-five\r\nin number, and though some of the members live six miles apart, and the\r\nmeetings are held at the houses, yet through all the past long and dreary\r\nwinter there was an average attendance of more than three fourths of\r\nthe membership. “And,” thus writes our correspondent, “each member is\r\nexpected to do whatever the committee may assign him. We never have a\r\nfailure. The program is always carried out to the letter.”——At CASNOVIA,\r\na circle of nine was organized in October last. Like nearly all our\r\nstudents, they are extremely busy people, but yet thorough in their\r\nwork. They hold informal meetings for discussions and conversation on\r\nthe readings of the month.——The first of January a circle was organized\r\nat MILFORD, Michigan, composed of twelve ladies, not all of them ’88s,\r\nthere being a sprinkling of graduates and seniors to give direction to\r\n“Plymouth Rock” enthusiasm.——“One more Michigan circle” is heard of at\r\nJONESVILLE. The circle started out with twelve members, and is keeping\r\nup a working membership of nine. The meetings are very enjoyable, every\r\none taking part in the most interesting and informal way.——Last October a\r\nwave of Chautauqua enthusiasm passed DUNDEE, Michigan, which resulted in\r\norganizing a C. L. S. C. of six members. They call the new organization\r\n“Longfellow’s” circle, and hope with the next year the numbers will\r\nincrease. The circle has observed all memorial days, which have proved of\r\ngreat benefit and interest.——Evidently the “wave” has not left Michigan\r\nyet, for we have just received a card telling of the organization and\r\nelection of officers of a new circle at GREENVILLE. Success to their\r\nefforts.——A sample of the work which the C. L. S. C. helps the student\r\nto do, the GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan, circle furnishes in a recent program.\r\nThe exercises included, in brief, papers which took “broad, quick views.”\r\nArticles upon Thucydides, Socrates, Plato, Herodotus, Sappho, Greek\r\nMythology, British Association for the Advancement of Science, American\r\nSoil, Life of Longfellow, and a review of Longfellow’s novel, “Hyperion.”\r\nThis circle has made a big stride since last year, its membership having\r\nincreased from twenty-three to thirty-seven.——The new pronoun which\r\ntroubled some of our students has been employed by a correspondent from\r\nthe circle at JACKSON, MICH. Perhaps his zeal to fill up this “long\r\nfelt want” in language will make more clear to our readers the use of\r\n“thon.” These circle notes are very suggestive: “We meet weekly at the\r\nhome of one of the members, a system we have found to be an improvement\r\non that of meeting in a public hall. Chautauqua’s special sphere of\r\ninfluence is in the home; it is here ‘thon’ expects to do work which\r\nwill be lasting, and eventually permeate every department of life. It\r\nwill then be easily understood why ‘thon’ should find home and its\r\nassociations a more congenial place of meeting than a public hall. Our\r\nmeetings are conducted much in the usual manner, except, perhaps, our\r\nmode of managing a ‘discussion.’ To this feature we make special claim\r\nas being the originators. The leader of these talks, whose duty it is to\r\n‘keep the ball rolling,’ is, with the subject, chosen a week beforehand.\r\nEach of the members is expected to inform ‘thonself’ on the topic thus\r\nallotted, and to be prepared to give an opinion or ask questions. Richard\r\nGrant White’s language articles, ‘The Art of Speech,’ and ‘The Temperance\r\nTeachings of Science,’ have already been dealt with in this profitable\r\nand interesting way.”\r\n\r\nWe are glad to be able to introduce INDIANA this month with a clipping\r\nfrom a private letter to the lady here so honored:\r\n\r\n                                                        “WABASH, IND.\r\n\r\n    “I want to tell you how our local circle of the C. L. S. C.\r\n    honored itself last night in deciding to be called the ‘Frances\r\n    Willard’ circle, and, furthermore, to observe your birthday as\r\n    a memorial day.… We have in our circle, as you may suppose, a\r\n    number of ladies active in the work of the W. C. T. U. Our circle\r\n    numbers thirty-two. It was organized in ’79, but never christened\r\n    until last night. The vote on the name was unanimous.”\r\n\r\nFrom ALBION, INDIANA a friend writes: “We have organized a circle here\r\nconsisting of twenty-four members. Prof. E. C. White, superintendent\r\nof schools, is our leader; and is greatly interested in our circle and\r\nits work. We meet each week, at the residences of the members, taking\r\nthem alphabetically. The majority of the teachers in our public schools\r\nbelong to the circle, and all the members are much interested in their\r\nwork.”——And still another from the same state, from FOWLER, says: “We\r\norganized in October, 1884, with nine members; the circle now numbers\r\nfourteen members, of four different classes. One item of each program\r\nis a question drawer, questions to be taken from suggestions of the\r\nweekly readings. If any question is not answered by the circle, it is\r\nassigned to some member to be answered at the next meeting. I find this\r\nstimulates all to read carefully, as no one can know just what part of\r\nthe week’s reading is to be investigated. This is a most interesting\r\nfeature, and we can get those to engage in this who will do nothing\r\nelse. We have two members living at a distance who are only present in\r\nperson occasionally, but always present in manuscript when on program,\r\nso we call them our ‘paper members.’”——A Chautauqua circle was organized\r\nat LIGONIER, Indiana, in October, 1884, with a membership of seventeen,\r\nand named the “Ligonier Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle.” In\r\nit are represented three denominations. The programs are so varied as\r\nto avoid monotony in the exercises. One night the committee gave topics\r\nfor brief essays, on another, questions to be answered at next meeting.\r\nThe members of the circle pronounce the prescribed course of study\r\nexcellent and interesting in its details, and feel grateful for a plan so\r\nfar-reaching and so beneficent in its results. Bryant’s, Milton’s, and\r\nLongfellow’s days were observed by devoting to them and their works the\r\nentire evening. A knot of cardinal and old gold ribbon constitutes the\r\ncircle’s badge. The circle is highly pleased with the motto “Let us be\r\nseen by our deeds,” and many of the members express themselves satisfied\r\nwith their name, “Plymouth Rocks.”——We have received the list of names of\r\nthe members, fifteen in all, which form the circle of BROOKVILLE, Ind. We\r\nare hoping to receive some of the Brookville circle’s experiences soon.\r\n\r\nThe “Peripatetics” of CHICAGO, ILL., is an organization formed last\r\nfall. There are twelve members. The circle, we fear, is not using the\r\nlocal circles’ reports right, if, when they read them, they feel almost\r\ndiscouraged at the little they have accomplished. The whole spirit of\r\nChautauqua is, “what has been done can be done,” and our work is mainly\r\nto show by actual example what has been done. The “Peripatetics” have\r\ntoo many opportunities for doing superior work, living as they do, in\r\nsuch a city as Chicago, to grow discouraged.——The death of Richard Grant\r\nWhite has been a great loss to Chautauquans. His admirable “Studies in\r\nEnglish” had met the warmest reception, and when they were cut short\r\nby his death all our readers felt they had met a personal loss. It was\r\nthis feeling that led a Chicago circle to add to their resolutions of\r\nrespect passed upon Mr. White’s death, a clause stating that as a feeble\r\nexpression of their regard and, as a token of respect to his memory,\r\ntheir local circle be hereafter known as the “Richard Grant White.”——For\r\nnovel diversions, commend us to the “Alpha,” of QUINCY. This circle has\r\nsandwiched a great amount of fun in with its solid work this winter,\r\nnor has it been to the injury of the work. On College day they had a\r\nsleigh ride, not long after a mock trial; they have introduced a paper,\r\nthe _Symposium_, which gives an opportunity for numberless hits, and on\r\nValentine’s day the _Symposium_ furnished the entertainment, each member\r\nhaving sent to the editor an anonymous piece of poetry.——A circle was\r\norganized in STERLING last October, and has now nine members. They have\r\nno officers, and each meeting is conducted by the lady at whose house\r\nit is held. Their informal way of doing things has some advantages. An\r\ninvalid member is mentioned, who, like many others, finds relief in\r\naffliction by having something to do, and doing it religiously.\r\n\r\nOn one of the last evenings of September, a few Morrisonians met and\r\norganized the “Alpha Society,” of MORRISON, ILLINOIS. They number\r\nfifteen, and have accomplished much by the winter’s work. The plan\r\nhas been to take the outline of required reading, as laid down in THE\r\nCHAUTAUQUAN, and prepare the lesson as thoroughly as possible by the use\r\nof books and encyclopædias. At the meetings the class recites the lessons\r\nlearned the week before. Occasionally they have an essay, or select\r\nreading.——A circle of twenty members was organized in JACKSONVILLE,\r\nIll., last October, with the Rev. H. E. Butler, pastor of Congregational\r\nChurch, as president. They have given special attention thus far to the\r\nGreek course, enlarging the reading, and bringing in other authors as far\r\nas possible. Now that the Greek is nearly finished the circle is bringing\r\nchemistry into prominence.——The “Oakland” circle, of CHICAGO, Illinois,\r\nwas organized in February, 1884, and belongs to the “Pansy” class. It\r\nhas a good _constitution_, and hopes to survive till the graduation of\r\nits members. This circle is composed entirely of ladies, among whom are\r\nrepresentatives of six churches in the South Division of the city. The\r\nmeetings, which are held semi-monthly at the houses of the members, are\r\nwell attended. Absent members are informed by postal cards of the place\r\nof the next meeting, the parts assigned them on the program, and the\r\nauthor from whom quotations are to be given. Those who are absent three\r\ntimes in succession are expected to present a suitable excuse to the\r\nsociety. At the close of the year a reception was given, to which each\r\nmember invited a gentleman friend. A fine literary and musical program\r\nwas rendered, and refreshments were served. The guests, among whom were\r\nministers, lawyers, army officers, and members of the Chicago Board of\r\nTrade, were called upon to express their opinions of the C. L. S. C. A\r\nmost enjoyable evening was spent.\r\n\r\nA flourishing circle has existed at PORTAGE, WISCONSIN, for three\r\nyears. It is only one of three, however, for last year the pastor of\r\nthe M. E. Church organized a circle which is still active, and this\r\nyear the Presbyterian pastor started a third. The _mother_ circle is\r\nundenominational, as best becomes her position. One feature of this\r\ncircle’s year is its annual reception. Let the secretary tell how it\r\nis managed: “We have heretofore held a reception at the close of each\r\nyear, to which were invited the people of the place presumed to be most\r\ninterested in education. The exercises have always been highly commended,\r\nand our work well appreciated by those in attendance—indeed, we consider\r\nour best missionary work has been done by this means—and many members\r\nadded through the instrumentality of a sugar-coated dose of hard work\r\n(or its results, rather). Many people would attend a party, to whom a\r\nliterary meeting of any kind is a ‘delusion and a snare.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE C. L. S. C. CLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS OF 1885.—“THE INVINCIBLES.”\r\n\r\n“_Press on, reaching after those things which are before._”\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.\r\n\r\n    _President_—J. B. Underwood, Meriden, Conn.\r\n\r\n    _Vice President_—C. M. Nichols, Springfield, Ohio.\r\n\r\n    _Treasurer_—Miss Carrie Hart, Aurora, Ind.\r\n\r\n    _Secretary_—Miss M. M. Canfield, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n    _Executive Committee_—Officers of the class.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter Commencement, what? More of the same sort, undoubtedly—of a better\r\nsort, if possible. The members of the class of ’85 are now near enough\r\nto the “finish” to arrive at some more or less mature conclusions as to\r\nthe future. They find that the word “commencement” is to be no misnomer,\r\nand is not even to be criticised. For after four years of reading and\r\nstudy the students find that they have not come to the end, but only\r\nto the beginning. The matter selected for them has been so good, so\r\nsubstantial, and really so inspiring, as a whole, that an immortal, if\r\nnot divine, sort of hunger for the best in literature, science, art,\r\nphilosophy, has been created in their minds, and they could hardly\r\nstop if they desired. The aggregate amount of literary and scientific\r\ninformation which has been acquired is really large, and much of it has\r\nbeen retained as a permanent fund of knowledge, but this has proved to\r\nbe but a small part of the benefit that has been derived. Thousands of\r\npeople have just begun to find out how little they really know, and how\r\nmuch they ought yet to learn, to satisfy their own ideas and notions as\r\nto what is required to make one, not learned, indeed, but reasonably well\r\ninformed! And what they think they need to know, they feel sure that they\r\nhave now discovered how to learn, and have acquired habits of reading\r\nand thinking which will make the processes easy and enjoyable, instead\r\nof laborious and tiresome. They have already looked beyond bounds into\r\nthe green fields and pastures new of that which is best, most beautiful,\r\nand grandest in the domain of thought, and suggestion, and philosophical\r\nresearch and discovery, as brought out by poets, philosophers, statesmen\r\nand philanthropists, and they are likely to pass through the Golden Gate\r\nand out from the Temple on the hill into a still broader fraternity of\r\nthought and action, whose limits will correspond with those of the world\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA breezy letter from the plains of Dakota contains the following: “I\r\nhave been studying entirely alone, and have found the course a blessing\r\nthat can not be valued. Here, quite removed from society, while winter\r\nwinds howl round my cabin home, I find help, companionship and pleasure\r\nin the studies of the dear ‘Home College.’ The most attractive corner of\r\nmy little room is the one where my beloved books lie on the home-made\r\nshelves. My little ones love them too, and there is scarcely a time when\r\nI need help but what I can find it in my books.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne young lady from Massachusetts, who hopes to hear the “Chautauqua\r\nChimes,” writes: “I have a class of girls in Sunday-school, and want so\r\nmuch the help I think I shall be able to find at Chautauqua. The course\r\nhas been just what I needed, and I know I have grown, mentally and\r\nmorally, since joining the C. L. S. C.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis from a gentleman in Kansas: “If health will permit I hope to be one\r\nto enter in under the Arches among the ‘Invincibles.’ I must be one of\r\nthe oldest of the ’85s. I was fifteen days old at the battle of Waterloo,\r\nand, if I am spared till my next birthday, I shall have arrived at the\r\nbounds allotted to man in the Bible.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne ’85 writes: “I hope to receive my diploma at Chautauqua, but, I am a\r\nbusy mother with six children, and can not always plan so long ahead. I\r\nhave had the greatest pleasure and satisfaction in the course, for, with\r\na family of wide-awake boys and girls about me, I have found it is very\r\nnecessary to refresh myself and keep well informed on all subjects.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne enthusiastic lady from Texas writes: “I have gathered through four\r\nyears of delightful reading an intellectual bouquet, whose fragrance\r\nI hope to wear about me when I pass, not only through the Arches at\r\nChautauqua, but when I pass through the ‘Beautiful Gates’ to the\r\nCelestial City.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother testifies: “I am one of the busy mothers and housekeepers who\r\npursue the C. L. S. C. course under numerous and varied difficulties, but\r\nfind my enthusiasm increasing as the four years draw to a close.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Massachusetts: “I intend to still ‘press on’ after I graduate—in\r\nfact, I hope always to be a Chautauquan.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWisconsin contributes: “I like our motto and our name, and I love the C.\r\nL. S. C. Though reading alone, it has always been an inspiring thought\r\nthat many thousands are reading the same course.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother: “I regret that the course is so nearly finished, but the spirit\r\nit has awakened within me has enabled me to ‘Press on, reaching after\r\nthose things which are before.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS OF 1886.—“THE PROGRESSIVES.”\r\n\r\n“_We study for light, to bless with light._”\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n    _President_—The Rev.

The following report of their reunion represents\r\nsomething of their enthusiasm: The New England branch of the class\r\nof 1887 C. L. S. C. held its spring meeting in the chapel of Union\r\nCongregational Church, Providence, April 3d, 1885. About one hundred\r\nmembers were present. After a short time spent in social intercourse, the\r\nmeeting was called to order by the president, the Rev. F. M. Gardner, for\r\nRhode Island. The C. L. S. C. study song was sung, which was followed by\r\nthe secretary’s report of the meeting in Boston; the minutes were duly\r\napproved. It was voted that the committee on headquarters be increased by\r\nthe addition of Mr. Jeffers, of Pawtucket, and Mrs. Morrill, of Allston.\r\nMr. Gardner, in his own bright manner, gave some account of the efforts\r\nof the committee in preparing for class headquarters at Lakeview, and\r\nstated reasons why the plan suggested at the Boston meeting should be\r\npostponed, though not abandoned. Inasmuch as several members of our\r\nclass have been afflicted by the loss of loved ones from their homes,\r\nit was voted that a committee be appointed to present resolutions at\r\nthis meeting expressing the sympathy of the class with them in their\r\nbereavement. The musical and literary exercises were opened with a fine\r\npiano solo, which was followed by a pleasing quartette. Then an address\r\non “The C. L. S. C. _vs._ Social Pastimes,” by the Rev. N. T. Dyer, of\r\nMiddleboro, was delivered. Mr. Dyer being unable to be present because\r\nof illness, Mrs. Dyer most creditably took his place. The address was a\r\nconvincing statement of the advantages of the C. L. S. C., and could it\r\nbe circulated among those not interested in the course, would undoubtedly\r\ninfluence many to enroll in the Circle. Mrs. Emily C. Fletcher, of\r\nPawtucket, read a poem written for the occasion, from which we extract\r\nthe following, referring to the influence of the C. L. S. C.:\r\n\r\n    “It has cleared the brow of discontent,\r\n       Made happy the lowly one,\r\n     Cheering the home and its social hall,\r\n       Enliv’ning the tasks begun.\r\n\r\n    “It takes from age the mournful thoughts,\r\n       That often the heart will shroud,\r\n     It lifts the life to a higher sphere,\r\n       Silvering ev’ry dark cloud.”\r\n\r\nAfter music, and an address on Lakeview, resolutions of sympathy to those\r\nof the circle who had met with bereavements were adopted. The association\r\nthen adjourned, after which a delightful reunion was enjoyed by the\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo members of the class of ’87 have recently left us for the “better\r\nlife:” Miss Grace F.

The picturesque spot where live these ’88s is about a day’s\r\njourney from the railroad. They name themselves after the Indians,\r\n“Uncompahgee,” who once wigwamed there. They have their “round-table,”\r\nand keep up their weekly meetings.—Another circle, of three, has been\r\norganized among the “Rockies,” at Gunnison, Colorado, and meets weekly.\r\nOur ’88s have reached the Indian Territory. At Chouteau we have one hard\r\nworker, who, having commenced in February, has nearly caught up with the\r\nclass.—At the confluence of the Missouri and Vermillion Rivers we have\r\nan enthusiastic class of ten. Lawyers, teachers, journalists, milliners,\r\nand busy wives, with a “Pansy” for the president, compose the class.\r\nThey conduct their class weekly, on the “conversational plan,” which\r\nthey claim affords grand opportunity for interchange of opinions and\r\nsentiments.—A circle of five ladies and one lone gentleman compose the\r\n“Clio,” of Clark, Dakota. So delighted are they that they never adjourn\r\nfor any other engagements.—The “Kankakee,” of Illinois, thirty-eight\r\nregular and four honorary members, meets fortnightly. Their Shakspere\r\nprogram was so full that a portion was postponed until the next meeting.\r\nAn honorary member has delighted them with an address upon “Water.”—The\r\ntwelve members of “Calumet,” Carthage, Ill., were favored with a visit\r\nand instructive talk from Chancellor Vincent.—We were greatly surprised\r\nto receive a letter from our old friend, the Rev. W. H. Hyatt, president\r\nof our circle in Whiteland, Ind.—Ten young persons of Dubuque, Iowa,\r\ncompose the “Circle of Athens.” An excellent motto have they selected:\r\n_Sapientiam petimus_. That their search for wisdom is eager is evinced by\r\nthe fact that they have in a most interesting manner pursued the studies\r\nin spite of all allurements. The memorial days have been appropriately\r\nobserved, and Longfellow’s day celebrated by a banquet.—Seven constitute\r\n“Alpha,” of Barnesville, Ohio. They began January 1, and have nearly\r\ncompleted their studies. They expect to begin on time next year.—The\r\n“Athena,” of Wanskuck, Providence, R. I., is composed of fifteen busy\r\npeople, who are delighted with the studies.—From the programs of the\r\n“Hamilton,” of Lowell, Mass., we are satisfied that the forty members\r\nare truly among our liveliest coming Chautauquans. They have largely\r\nexperimented in chemistry and electricity. This circle mourns the loss\r\nof one of its best members in Mrs. Benjamin Robinson, who endeavored to\r\nbrave a New England storm, in order to attend one of the meetings, and\r\nlost her life.—Seventeen regular and three honorary members represent\r\na circle in Joplin, Mo. Nothing but illness has caused an absence at\r\n“roll call.” Once a week they follow Chautauqua program. Success has\r\nmarked their public as well as private meetings.—One from Maine has\r\ntaken fresh courage since reading Chancellor Vincent’s article in the\r\nApril CHAUTAUQUAN, “How to Work Alone.”—The “Riversides,” of Milford,\r\nN. H. (eight members), have finished the year’s studies.—“Zeta Phi,” of\r\nBuffalo, N. Y., are seven “zealous learners.” They observe all special\r\ndays, having essays upon given subjects.—A zealous lady of ’87 class\r\norganized seven earnest and hopefuls into the “I. X. L.,” of Newport,\r\nKy.—Clamida (state not named) boasts of two enthusiastic circles. The\r\nsecretary of one strongly objects to our name, repudiating the idea that\r\nwe have anything in common with the “Pilgrim Fathers.” She is even tired\r\nof a reference to their trials, and believes, with another, that the\r\n“Pilgrim Mothers” are more worthy of “toasting,” closing with “Seriously,\r\nwhy were we thus afflicted?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAUTAUQUA UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nA TEACHING METHOD.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. RICHARD S. HOLMES, A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nI desire in this paper to make some very plain answers in a very plain\r\nway to a question which has come to me in varying forms, from various\r\nsources. It is a practical question, and concerns the possibilities of\r\nthat department of Chautauqua work which aims to bring the advantages\r\nof the higher education within the reach of those large classes of our\r\npopulation which have been hitherto debarred from them. Naturally, the\r\nquestion originates with the very people whom the enterprise seeks to\r\naid, and strangely enough is shared by those whose culture and education\r\nshould have been a barrier to such a doubt.\r\n\r\nMen who would gladly avail themselves of any real advantages for\r\neducation brought within their reach, and within their means, yet\r\nunwilling to make the pecuniary outlay which the effort might involve,\r\nuntil convinced that the correspondence system offers real advantages,\r\nhesitate, and say: “We are favorably impressed with the idea as given in\r\nyour announcements, but are not sure that it can be put into practical\r\noperation; before attempting the work it may demand, we are compelled to\r\nask, how is the work to be done? how can teaching by correspondence be\r\nmade practically successful? Show us the method, that we may understand.”\r\nStill others, men of advanced education, of approved excellence of\r\njudgment, men engaged in professional life, have said, “We concede that\r\neducation by the means you propose is possible under certain favorable\r\nconditions, but we doubt the practicability of attempting by such a\r\nmeans to cover the wide field of general education.” Straightway they\r\nfall to instancing particular subjects as illustrations of the truth\r\nof their statement. Now the proof of the pudding is in the eating; and\r\nif this paper succeed in furnishing tastes of this particular pudding\r\nwhich shall be palatable and shall create a favorable opinion as to the\r\nworth of the whole, the service rendered to the cause will be valuable.\r\nI propose, therefore, without invading the province of any of the gifted\r\nteachers who act as Directors of the different Departments and Schools in\r\nthe Chautauqua School of Liberal Arts, as we shall hereafter call what\r\nhas been known as the University, to show, if possible, how a person\r\nof good natural endowment, at the maximum of his mental strength, and\r\nwith earnest devotion to his work can acquire a knowledge of a language,\r\nliterature, or science by correspondence alone.\r\n\r\nI will make three preliminary remarks. First, the student must bring\r\nto this work the same earnestness that he gives to that pursuit of his\r\ndaily life upon which he has been or may be dependent for his livelihood.\r\nSecond, in the study of language by correspondence, the path marked out\r\nby the experience of the ages is the path in which the correspondence\r\nstudent must go. The gateway of that path is the grammar of the language;\r\nand no student can pass through it till he possess the key which shall\r\nunlock its bars. To own a grammar is therefore a necessity. I am ready\r\nto believe that in oral teaching of a language, actual study of grammar,\r\nas grammar, may be put over into the final years of the course, giving\r\nthe early years to the undisputed control of synthetic methods; but for\r\nthe correspondence student, a grammar is an essential. Third, the student\r\nmust be willing to follow the most minute directions of his teacher,\r\nwithout question, no matter how simple or how difficult a matter their\r\nperformances may seem to be. To obey is the first essential to success.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at a _method_ for learning a language or science. It is\r\nnot given as _the method_ in use in the schools, but only as a means of\r\nshowing that the thing proposed is possible. There should be for the\r\nbeginner four papers for every lesson; or four kinds of work to be done.\r\n\r\n_First_—There should be a paper _stating principles to be learned_, and\r\nadding complete references to the text-book upon which they are based,\r\nthat the student may add to his teacher’s dictum, the confirmation of\r\nhis own research. Let it be distinctly noted that this paper is _to\r\ncontain statements of principles to be learned_, and is not to be a mere\r\nbudget of directions to paragraphs and sections of a text-book. The\r\nadvantages to be gained by such a method of study are too obvious to need\r\nelaboration here.\r\n\r\n_Second_—There should be a paper giving abundant and apt illustrations of\r\nthose principles, derived from the best sources, adapted to the pupil’s\r\nknowledge, and different from any which have been otherwise brought to\r\nhis notice. These illustrations of principles should be memorized by the\r\nstudent and should form the basis of the paper containing the test of the\r\nstudent’s work.\r\n\r\n_Third_—There should be a paper giving examples for practice in these\r\nsame principles; examples for transliteration, phonic representation, or\r\ntranslation in case of a foreign language, examples for experimentation,\r\nclassification, or analysis in case of a science or literature.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_—There should be a paper of examination or question, for the\r\npurpose of testing the student and revealing the character of the work he\r\nhas done. These questions should be framed with the utmost care and skill\r\nof which the teacher is master, and should act as a quickening impulse\r\nto the student. This paper should be in a sealed envelope, and should\r\nnot be opened till all the work of the other three papers has been done,\r\nand the student feels that his lesson is learned. In addition to what\r\nhas been suggested, there should be required in the study of language,\r\nas soon as the student can correctly pronounce, a regular exercise in\r\nmemorizing from some standard author, and daily repetitions aloud of\r\nwhat is thus given to the memory. In the case of English, Latin, and\r\nGreek, this seems to me indispensable. This last suggestion, it will be\r\nnoticed, contains a hint that the pronunciation of a language can be\r\ntaught by correspondence. It is a hint which I am prepared to assert as\r\na proposition, and to defend as far as the Latin and Greek languages are\r\nconcerned. The amount of matter given in the lesson should be enough to\r\nrequire one week for its preparation by a student able to devote from\r\none to two hours daily to study.\r\n\r\nWhen the papers of a lesson have been fully mastered, and the student\r\nfeels that all he can do upon it is done, the whole work should be at\r\nonce sent back to the teacher. Now, to guard against loss of time, such\r\nas would occur were the student compelled to wait without work after he\r\nhas forwarded his lesson recitation to the teacher until the necessary\r\nexchange by post has been made, two lessons should be sent out by the\r\nteacher at the first assignment. This plan would wholly avoid what might\r\nbe costly delay where student and teacher were separated by the width of\r\nthe continent or the ocean.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first recitation paper reaches the teacher’s hand, his\r\nimmediate duty is to forward the next lesson of the series, and so\r\nregularly through the whole course of instruction. He will now at his\r\nleisure examine the paper which has come into his possession, while the\r\nstudent is engaged upon the second of his lessons. What shall be the\r\nteacher’s work with this returned paper? Certainly not one of correction.\r\nNow begins his real work of teaching. First, there must be a careful\r\nand painstaking inspection of each line of the student’s work. Second,\r\nevery error must be plainly marked, so that the eye of the student\r\nwill not fail to observe it. Third, plain reference should be made to\r\nthose sections and paragraphs of the grammar or text-book which have\r\nbeen violated. Fourth, a word of encouragement, advice, suggestion, or\r\nwarning should be added to each paper, drawn from the teacher’s wide and\r\nvaried experience, and which will be practically helpful to the pupil. It\r\nmust be carefully noted that in this treatment of the recitation paper,\r\nthe teacher has made no correction, has told nothing, but has simply\r\nindicated errors, and thrown the student back upon his own resources to\r\ncorrect his own work. This is one of the elements of true teaching.\r\n\r\nThe return of this critically marked paper to the student brings us to\r\nconsider another important process in this work, and that is the review\r\nby the student of his first lesson work, or his second period of study\r\nupon it. There has enough time elapsed since it was last in his hands\r\nto have it come now with all the force of a new lesson, and to enable\r\nhim to look at it judicially. The critical investigation which follows\r\nhas a three-fold value. First, it is a review. Second, it is a means\r\nfor accurate self-test. Third, it is a monitor, under whose warning all\r\nfuture lesson work is subjected to the careful scrutiny which the former\r\ncriticism suggests. Two things still remain to be done with the returned\r\nlesson paper. One to make a separate classified list of the errors it\r\ncontained; the other to date it, file it, and lay it carefully away for\r\nreference. The classified list of errors will serve as a check against\r\nthe commission of like errors, or an aid in detecting any that may have\r\nbeen carelessly made. At first the list will be large, but after a little\r\nit will grow less and less rapidly, till finally its utter lack of growth\r\nwill be the surest mark of the pupil’s excellence of attainment. Such\r\nis an outline for a possible method of conducting educational work by\r\ncorrespondence. It presents a method which I believe is practical, which\r\nis drawn from an experience of years in the class room, and which is in\r\nharmony with established principles of educational philosophy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA touching bit of experience has been sent us by a member of the class\r\nof ’88. The writer had persuaded his son to join a circle, but, as he\r\nwrites, “He attended one meeting of the circle and came home very much\r\ndiscouraged, declaring that he would not attend another meeting, urging\r\nas his reasons that he compared unfavorably with others, and that he\r\nwould never be able to pronounce those horrid Greek names, etc. I tried\r\nto encourage him and advanced several arguments trying to show him what a\r\ngreat advantage this course of reading would be to him, but finally gave\r\nit up, fearing if I urged him so strongly he would become disgusted. I\r\ndetermined then to take the four years’ course of study myself, thinking\r\nthat by having the books in our home, and sometimes relating anecdotes,\r\nincidents and historical facts gathered from these readings, that my boys\r\nmight become interested for themselves. It is impossible for me to give\r\nmy children the advantages of a liberal education, as my heart longs to\r\ndo, and by getting them interested in the C. L. S. C., I hope to make up\r\nto them in some degree their loss of a college education.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S OUTLOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN DIPLOMAT.\r\n\r\nThere is very general regret, at home and abroad, that the new\r\nadministration has removed Professor James Russell Lowell from the\r\noffice of American minister at the court of St. James. There is no\r\ndisposition to complain; but there is some natural wonderment. Mr. Lowell\r\nwas an ideal American diplomat; he represented worthily the people as\r\nwell as the government of the United States. It is no disparagement to\r\nhis successor to say that no other American can quite fill the place\r\nMr. Lowell has made for himself. It should be remembered that we,\r\nfortunately, have very little proper diplomatic business anywhere in the\r\nworld; and whenever any serious negotiation is to be undertaken, it can\r\nbe done at Washington. Our important treaties are made in the national\r\ncapital; and our gravest foreign affairs are always directly administered\r\nby the Secretary of State. Since Franklin it has seldom happened that a\r\nminister has been entrusted with any grave duties or burdened with any\r\nserious responsibilities. Even during the civil war Mr. Seward managed at\r\nWashington the more serious business of the foreign department.\r\n\r\nIn this generation, we have had some successful foreign ministers;\r\nbut their success has in every case been in non-official or\r\nextra-official lines. Mr. E. B. Washburne, our minister in Paris\r\nduring the Franco-German war, won a high reputation, not as a diplomat\r\nof his country, but as an American minister entrusted, by an act of\r\ninternational courtesy, with the rights and welfare of Prussians in\r\nParis. As the agent of the Berlin government during the war and siege,\r\nMr. Washburne endeared himself to the large German population of Paris by\r\nhis kindness, common sense, and energy in caring for a body of subjects\r\nof a hostile country. No one but a typical American could have done this\r\nwork at all well. A man trained to diplomacy would have failed. It needed\r\na man who could put his character and American office into a breach made\r\nby war, and devise means of providing for an extemporaneous necessity.\r\nMost men would have failed; Washburne succeeded because he was a typical\r\nAmerican of the largest pattern—able, frank, tireless, resourceful.\r\n\r\nIn England, Mr. Lowell has, under different circumstances, developed a\r\nnew line of diplomatic representation. He has represented the character\r\nand culture of the American people. The average politician supposes\r\nhimself to be the typical American; the fact that we are ashamed of\r\nhim is the sufficient proof that he is thoroughly mistaken. In what do\r\nAmericans broadly differ from most other, if not all other, peoples? Is\r\nit not in this, that we are the great reading nation of the world? Our\r\nculture goes down to the bottom and reaches out to the extremities of\r\nour life. We have no class distinctions, no titled magnates, no rights\r\nof birth-privilege; and in the school rooms of the land the rich and the\r\npoor meet together, and our great newspapers go into the hands of both\r\nrich and poor. We are not so distinctly a nation of commercial people\r\nas we are a nation of people under an unexampled influence of general\r\nculture. A Professor who was much more than a professor; a man of the\r\nworld who was also a man of books; an alert and quick, practical man who\r\nwas also a poet; a gentleman who was, first of all, manly; a diplomat\r\nwho was at home in a school room, could lecture on any literary theme,\r\ncould instruct the educated Englishman in the history of his own men of\r\nletters; an American who knew Shakspere, Milton, Bunyan, the English\r\nBible, and every shred of English art and song and event by heart—such a\r\nman has Mr. Lowell been in England. He was at home there on those levels\r\nof life and heights of achievement which are common to us and Englishmen;\r\nand his leadership there in literature and learning conferred honor\r\non us in the precisely most honorable things in our character as a\r\npeople. We simply are not philistines—hard dogmatists of dollars and\r\nprecedents—we are a thoughtful, informed, studious and brainy people who\r\ndespise wealth which is not held for the service of truth, well-being\r\nand progress. No man could represent us so well as a poet, teacher,\r\nessayist and scholar like Mr. Lowell. He could represent us at the level\r\nof those ideals and achievements of which we are not ashamed. We despise\r\nnothing so heartily as illiterate wealth; no other people on earth equal\r\nus in contempt for the commerce which has only sordid aims and results.\r\nThe American merchant builds schools, museums, churches, asylums,\r\nhospitals—if he does not we despise him.\r\n\r\nThe problem in selecting the best foreign representatives is to secure\r\nmen who will represent our national character. Our diplomacy is\r\nunimportant. Such as we have to do can be carried on at Washington. We\r\nwant ministers abroad who will be typical Americans, whose conspicuous\r\nposition will display in them the best and truest results of our unique\r\nsocial and political system. If they are honored abroad, as Mr. Lowell\r\nhas been in unusual ways and measure, the honor is given to us and\r\nglorifies us. There is always a fool to say that our minister is more\r\nEnglish than American—simply because Englishmen respect him. It is a\r\npoor kind of criticism, and fortunately there is less and less of it in\r\nthe press. We all stand better abroad, command more honest respect, are\r\nbetter understood in our best characteristics, because James Russell\r\nLowell has represented us in London. May his successor succeed to the\r\nfull measure of this representative office.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished honor ever conferred upon an American has come\r\nto Mr. Lowell. The English press, representing the best public opinion\r\nof that nation, invites him to remain., in England “as the unofficial\r\nrepresentative of American literature, learning, manners, and knowledge\r\nof the world.” Nothing like that can be found in the long history of\r\ndiplomacy. “He has been,” says one great journal, “a sort of guest-friend\r\nof England,” and it then describes him as “the most eminent American\r\nof this generation,” and adds, “Englishmen of all ranks and stations\r\nrecognize in Mr. Lowell a faithful and jealous guardian of the interests\r\nof his country, and a type of all that is best in its intellectual and\r\nmoral character.” There is not a word in all these encomiums which is not\r\na eulogy of the American people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHOLERA.\r\n\r\nThe disease called Asiatic Cholera is at home in India. It travels, at\r\nlong intervals, into Europe. There have been eight: or nine of these\r\nvisitations during the century. The disease travels with man and his\r\nbelongings; and since intercourse between Asia and Europe has become\r\nmore swift and abundant, there is a tendency to more frequent visits of\r\nthe dreaded scourge. In fact, however, this tendency has been overcome\r\nby sanitary science. Until last year, cholera had not been in Europe for\r\nsixteen years. It arrived the last previous time in 1866 and tarried into\r\nthe next year. During all the intervening years, there was cholera on the\r\nGanges, and an increasing flow of humanity between the two continents;\r\nyet sixteen years elapsed between the visits. Last year cholera landed\r\nfrom ships at Toulon and Marseilles in southern France, and produced\r\ngeneral alarm in Europe. It swept around all the European coasts of\r\nthe Mediterranean, and in the especially filthy towns caused a large\r\nmortality. It has doubtless wintered in Europe, and its second year is\r\nusually the worst. It can begin early and use the long summer for its\r\ndesolating work. This is the second summer. It is probable that cholera\r\nwill be a large feature of the health and mortuary reports of the year.\r\nEuropean travel will be restricted by the caution which the prevalence of\r\nthis disease inspires. American resorts for Americans will be unusually\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nWill cholera visit us? In previous European visits it has always looked\r\nin upon us, sometimes the first, sometimes the second year. In 1866, it\r\ndid not come, but did come in 1867. But the visit of that year was less\r\nbaneful than any other we have had. In 1884, we escaped; can we escape in\r\n1885? No doubt exists that we _can_. It is only a question of effective\r\nquarantine. The faithful discharge of their duties by all health officers\r\nat ports would exclude the unwelcome guest. And, at our principal port,\r\nwhere the danger is greatest, there is good reason to believe that the\r\nfidelity, wisdom and vigilance are equal to the emergency. Cholera is\r\nmore likely to penetrate to us by some little-used door; the front\r\ngate will be securely guarded. At the smaller doors, there ought to be\r\nno danger. But there _is_ danger, and it is probably too much to hope\r\nthat there will be adequate watchfulness. There is, even at New York, a\r\nlong line of accidents to be reckoned with. It would not be surprising,\r\nhowever, if cholera got a foothold among us from the West Indies, landing\r\nin some southern port.\r\n\r\nIf it comes, what then? It should not be very successful in its work of\r\ndeath. It could be stamped out in any city with a well organized health\r\nforce. In New York, a few cases would not be cause for any alarm—not half\r\nso much as if the cases were in some small and careless community. Still\r\nit is most probable that if it effects a landing it will travel over the\r\ncountry. We have had warning enough. It is a filth disease which can be\r\ncornered and killed by cleanliness, if the cleanliness foreruns it. If we\r\nwait to clean up filthy quarters in our towns until the disease arrives,\r\nit will then be too late to clean. We shall have a good measure of the\r\nsanitary condition of our cities, if the cholera visits them. It will do\r\nits terrible work in the unclean quarters of unclean towns. It will not\r\nstop there. Once established in a filthy quarter, cholera easily thrusts\r\nits arms into adjacent clean places. If the long and loud warning has\r\nbeen heeded, there will be little to fear from cholera. The cleanliness\r\nof our towns will discourage and expel the intruder.\r\n\r\nWhat can individuals do? Keep cool and in good health. All epidemic\r\ndiseases fix upon the infirm, the debilitated, and the fearful. The\r\nmortality from cholera is only about one death for four cases. In some\r\nepidemics of it, the rate is one in three cases; but among people who\r\nare well fed and in fair conditions of comfort, and have proper care,\r\nthere are five chances of recovery to one of death. The high rate of\r\nmortality in some towns results from want of care and medicine. Popular\r\nrumor exaggerates the danger of death from cholera. It is a case of _ogne\r\nignotum pro magnifico_—we know so little about it that we magnify the\r\ndanger beyond all warrant of the actual facts. Some of our danger—perhaps\r\nmost of it—will come from the enthusiasm of the reporters. Last January\r\nthese enthusiasts discovered genuine Asiatic cholera in St. Louis. They\r\nwere sure of it. The evidence was perfect, they said. Of course there\r\nnever was, and never will be, a case of Asiatic cholera in St. Louis in\r\nJanuary. But after summer begins, the “Lo here” will begin to alarm the\r\ntimid. There are sure to be many false reports; the true one may be in\r\nthe bundle. Let us hope it will not be—and keep cool.\r\n\r\nWe hope that inland quarantines will not be resorted to if the disease\r\nappears among us. They are useless as well as inhuman. They shut the\r\nintruder out of the gate, and he crawls under the fence. If cholera\r\ngets upon this continent, safety will be secured only by cleanliness of\r\nstreets and houses. Clean people may die in clean streets, but it will be\r\nbecause there are unclean people in neighboring streets to receive and\r\nbreed the disease. Nor should the well fly from the sick. The nurses and\r\npriests are safest in Italian cities. Those who fly, do so when it is\r\ntoo late, and carry the disease with them. And, after all, cholera may\r\nnot visit us in 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nA REVIEW OF THE CHAUTAUQUA YEAR.\r\n\r\nA very marked indication of the success of the Chautauqua Idea is the\r\nincrease of imitations of our work; and this runs parallel with an\r\nincrease of efforts to promote systematic culture among grown people. Dr.\r\nSamuel Johnson used to say that he did all his hard study when he was a\r\nboy, and he very properly lamented it. It is one of the strangest things\r\nin modern civilization that, except among a small body of professors and\r\nspecialists, the world does its studying entirely in early life. If the\r\nchance to study, or the compulsion to study, be wanting in the first\r\ntwenty years, the door is supposed to be shut forever. The Chautauqua\r\nmovement tried to expose the folly of this method, and to show that\r\npersons whose education was neglected in youth may secure culture in\r\nmiddle life, or even in old age. History gave us examples enough; but\r\nChautauqua has made thousands of new examples to illustrate the perfect\r\npracticalness of adult study. The success of Chautauqua has drawn general\r\nattention to the subject. A variety of plans for promoting the education\r\nof adults are coming before the public. We do not regard any of them as\r\nrivals; they will enlarge our public as well as make smaller centers of\r\nsuch culture.\r\n\r\nThe members of the C. L. S. C. who have gone with us over the subjects\r\nof this year will do well to look back over the road and see precisely\r\nwhat they have gone over. They will probably notice that their study\r\nand reading has not interfered with their regular pursuits and duties.\r\nThey have been able to add these studies to their customary tasks and\r\ninterests. It is a kind of gratuity, therefore, which they have received.\r\nIt is so much in addition to other results of annual effort. They will\r\nfurther see that the amount of this study and reading is considerable.\r\nGood method has made odd minutes yield a bulk which would require weeks\r\nof consecutive and unbroken effort. The effect on the mind is better\r\nand more permanent because the study has been continued through a year.\r\nA college man of our acquaintance says that Professor Time does better\r\nwork than any of his colleagues. Our C. L. S. C. members have had the\r\ninstruction of Professor Time. Those who are finishing the course will\r\ndo well to remember that they have learned how to learn without a living\r\nteacher. This is the best thing the C. L. S. C. has done for you—this\r\nhelping you to study alone. A power of this sort ought to be cultivated\r\nand kept. The contents of any course of education should be small in\r\ncomparison with the attainments which it renders possible. This large,\r\nbroad, life-long self-education lies in the power to study alone without\r\nthe fear of a master or the ordeal of an examination before one. This\r\npower colleges fail to give, and it is one of their weaknesses that they\r\ncan not give it. When the taskmaster stopped, Samuel Johnson said that\r\nhe stopped learning. We may doubt it, but in a sense Johnson was right.\r\nIf any reader has acquired the power to _go on alone_ by pursuing the\r\ncourse, he has a rare piece of wealth, a capital which may produce the\r\nwidest and best culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD.”\r\n\r\nThe New York _World_ has done wondrously well to raise $30,000 by a\r\npopular subscription for the setting up of the Bartholdi statue in New\r\nYork harbor. Our readers know that this colossal statue of “Liberty\r\nEnlightening the World” is a present from the French people, but that\r\nthere has been no provision made for the cost of setting up the great\r\nwork of French art. Various attempts to raise the necessary $100,000 have\r\nyielded but small results, and when the _World_ took hold of the matter\r\nthe failure had become a very disagreeable joke for the press. Other\r\nnewspapers have engaged in public enterprises. The New York _Herald_\r\nsent a ship into the Arctic Ocean in search of the Pole. The New York\r\n_Tribune_ maintains by the subscriptions of its readers a “Fresh-Air\r\nFund” which gives thousands of children an outing in the country during\r\nthe hot months. The enterprise of the _World_ is, if possible, more\r\npraiseworthy, and its success in rescuing a lost cause is as honorable\r\nas it is unexpected. The subscriptions have been made by people of all\r\nconditions and fortunes, by boys and girls, by merchants, artists and\r\nlaborers. A popular interest in the subject has been created, a great\r\ndeal of information imparted, many mistakes corrected, and a popular\r\nsupport secured for a work of art. The work is in the line of large and\r\nhealthy philanthropy, and the _World_ deserves unstinted credit. Let us\r\nall hope that it will carry the cause through to entire success.\r\n\r\nWe are, as a nation, still poor in public statuary. We have some good\r\npieces and not a few failures. Perhaps many persons have feared that\r\nthe Bartholdi statue is another monstrosity. Let them take courage; the\r\n_World_ has presented excellent evidence that the work is equal to its\r\nmission. The French people are to have a small edition of it set up in\r\nParis, and eminent French critics are unsparing in their praise of it. Of\r\ncourse we can not be too confident of the effect of a statue higher than\r\nTrinity steeple or the pillars of the East River bridge, set up so as to\r\nface the sea and meet the eyes of the world entering the harbor of New\r\nYork. On that point there is excellent artistic judgment in favor of the\r\nsuccess of the audacious conception of the artist. We may now regard the\r\nplan as certain to be carried out at no distant day, and if it succeeds\r\nit will be one of the wonders of the world. A statue rising to the\r\nheight of three hundred and seventeen feet above the waves—the familiar\r\nfigure of Liberty confronting the world in our chief American city—will\r\nbe a unique and impressive piece of art, if it be not an utter failure.\r\nThe _if_ is not a large doubt; only the small doubt which attends the\r\nmost perfect human work which is as yet untried. The _World’s_ popular\r\nsubscription had passed $35,000 when these lines were sent to press, on\r\nthe 28th of April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE-BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nA highly successful “Chautauqua Day” has been carried out at the New\r\nOrleans Exposition, under the leadership of Prof. E. A. Spring, Prof. W.\r\nF. Sherwin and the Rev. A. H. Gillet. An audience of over 5,000 people\r\nmet in Music Hall to hear Bishop Mallalieu on “The Relation of Chautauqua\r\nto the Home and Society,” Prof. Sherwin on “The Story of Chautauqua,”\r\ntalks from Wallace Bruce and the Rev. Mr. Gillet, and music from the\r\nMexican Band. The great crowd was given Chautauqua badges and C. L. S.\r\nC. circulars, and taught the Chautauqua salute—the latter in compliment\r\nto Señor Payen, the leader of the Mexican Band, and the pet of the\r\nExposition. One of the audience remarked on leaving the hall: “I have\r\nbeen at every day entertainment here since the beginning, and this has\r\nbeen the most successful, the best managed, the most interesting occasion\r\nthere has been.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere has been an almost breathless attention given throughout the world\r\nduring the past month to the attitude of England and Russia. Words have\r\nbeen weighed and steps measured with the nicest exactness. Affairs which\r\nin other times would take up columns are given corners. The prevalent\r\nopinion has been that war must come, though peace negotiations are being\r\nvigorously pushed. Could war be held off twenty years it might be that we\r\nshould be so much wiser that arbitration might be made to prevail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most active business which the United States Navy has had for\r\nyears was caused by the Isthmus troubles. Our treaty with New Granada\r\nguarantees free and uninterrupted passage across the Isthmus. To secure\r\nthis a force of 500 men and four ships was placed at Aspinwall after the\r\ninsurgents had burned the city. They thence proceeded to Panama, which\r\nthey succeeded in restoring to order. Not an easy thing to do, with the\r\nnatives sympathizing generally with the rebels, and very suspicious of\r\nthe “Gringoes,” as they call us, and with the French determined to have\r\nthe credit of whatever restoration could be made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. de Lesseps is firmly convinced of the advantages to America of the\r\nPanama Canal, prophesying in a recent letter that it will reanimate our\r\nmerchant marine, will greatly enlarge our internal business, and make us,\r\nin short, commercial kings. It can hardly be doubted that were any one\r\nof the great schemes for interoceanic communication in operation, our\r\nwhole system of exchange would be modified and our business multiplied.\r\nThe chief question seems to be now, is the Panama Canal, Mr. Eads’s\r\nTehuantepec Ship Railway, or the Nicaragua Canal likely to be the best\r\nfor the United States?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe recent conviction of two “saints” charged with polygamy is having a\r\nwholesome effect. The law which makes such a decision possible in Utah\r\nis the Edmunds bill, by which a man believing it right to have more than\r\none living or undivorced wife at a time maybe challenged as a juryman.\r\nUnder this law it is extremely difficult for a Mormon brought to trial\r\nto escape sentence, and the sentence is such that the fear of it will\r\nmore than probably take a great deal of charm out of the doctrine of\r\n“spiritual wives.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe biographical department of the scrap-book compiler has had great\r\nopportunities to grow rich in anecdotes of General Grant this past month.\r\nHis prolonged illness and the wonderfully sustained interest and sympathy\r\nof the public have led to many letters and stories getting into print\r\nwhich otherwise might never have been known. All of this matter but shows\r\nmore and more clearly how just is our love and reverence for “our hero.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of the international copyright there were held in New\r\nYork recently, on two afternoons, Authors’ Readings. A notable galaxy of\r\nliterary characters gathered on the stage. Among them were George William\r\nCurtis, Professor Charles Carroll, Julian Hawthorne, Will Carleton,\r\nW. D. Howells, the Rev. Robert Collyer, Prof. H. H. Boyesen, Bishop\r\nPotter, Mark Twain, Edward Eggleston, Henry Ward Beecher, and others. The\r\naudience which greeted the readers was large and appreciative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most horrible accidents of the month of April was the\r\ncollapse of eight nearly completed tenement houses in New York City.\r\nTwelve persons were injured in the fall. The investigation discloses a\r\ndeliberate intention on the part of the contractor to use the poorest\r\nmaterial obtainable, and a criminal—whether intentional or not—neglect on\r\nthe part of building authorities to prevent his plan. Indeed, contractors\r\nwho are honest in their work, state the commission cares more for\r\nthe fee which puts a contract through than for the material put into\r\nthe building. A vigorous public sentiment which would put a few such\r\ncriminals into State prison might prove beneficial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Arbor Day” is extending its conquests. Its latest subject is none other\r\nthan the Province of Ontario, whose Minister of Education sends out a\r\ncommunication to all teachers asking that in the interest of sanitation\r\nand æsthetics the 8th of May be set apart as a holiday in every rural and\r\nvillage school, for grading school grounds, laying out walks, and setting\r\nout trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHon. B. G. Northrop, in a letter dated April 4th, writes: “Sixteen\r\nstates have adopted ‘Arbor Day,’ and to that result the article in THE\r\nCHAUTAUQUAN, and extracts quoted from it, have greatly contributed.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Education sends out a pamphlet on “Arbor Day.” It will help\r\nmany a teacher to an interest in the scheme, and will tell him what trees\r\nto select, how to plant them, and how to arrange a program suitable for\r\nthe holiday.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe trouble which we have with foreign tongues sometimes enables us to\r\nheartily appreciate the blunders of the foreigner who tries our English\r\ntongue. We can not possibly make worse blunders with French than a late\r\nnumber of the aristocratic _Révue des deux Mondes_, when in its attempts\r\nto express in English the idea of a candidate favoring a railway it said,\r\n“_My politic is railway_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne might almost call Lord Tennyson’s verses on “The Fleet” the literary\r\nsensation of the month. It is rather difficult to see just why the verses\r\ndeserve the unstinted ridicule American papers have given them. Certainly\r\nthey are tame, but Lord Tennyson is an old man—a man whom this generation\r\nought to honor for the noble pleasure he has left to it and to its\r\nposterity. Were his lines much worse, courtesy demands that we remember\r\nthat with age comes decay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe new Minister of Education in Greece, where the four Gospels are used\r\nas a reading book by the advanced classes in the primary department of\r\nthe public schools, proposes to introduce them into the higher schools.\r\nThe purity of the diction of the four Gospels makes them, regardless of\r\nother considerations, most desirable reading for children who are just\r\nforming their literary style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a sort of fashion which common sense people will be glad to\r\nadopt—the run on plain food which London society is said to be having.\r\nThe Prince of Wales began it by cutting down every _ménu_ over which he\r\npresided, and he has had a larger following than usual—both the people\r\nwho always follow and those whose good sense decides what they do, taking\r\nup the custom. It would be a wise lesson for both dinner givers and hotel\r\nkeepers to learn that the quality of a dinner can not possibly depend\r\nupon the number of dishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBringing out a successful novelty in flowers or vegetables, is to a\r\nnurseryman what a bonanza mine is to a westerner, or a flowing well to\r\nan oil producer. The present season has several: There is a new lettuce\r\nwith leaves like the oak, a red celery, a celery which blanches naturally\r\nand bears leaves like an ostrich plume; a pansy with blossoms two and one\r\nfourth inches in diameter; a zinnia round as a ball, and a mignonette\r\nwith spikes twelve to fifteen inches in length, and of pure white.\r\nPerhaps the greatest novelty about the business this spring is the fact\r\nthat in the cities the safe deposit vaults are receiving thousands of\r\npounds of invaluable seeds for keeping—treasures quite as priceless to\r\nthe seedsmen as the jewels which repose beside them are to their owners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother compliment to America! When M. de Lesseps, the new member of the\r\nFrench Academy, was installed, in April, he delivered, it is said, the\r\nshortest speech ever delivered by an incoming Academician. Thereupon\r\nM. de Rénan complimented him on adopting the pithy, pointed style of\r\n_l’Amerique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are very glad to introduce the Chautauqua Town and Country Club, a new\r\nbranch of the C. L. S. C., for the study of agriculture. Everybody is\r\nexpected to do something in this novel society of practical out-of-door\r\nwork. Everybody must raise a plant, or cultivate a bed, or care for\r\nan animal. A well known Orange Co., N. Y., farm is to be the working\r\nheadquarters of the new organization, and its course of reading and\r\nexperiment is under the control of Mr. Charles Barnard. Chancellor\r\nVincent honors the organization with his supervision, a guarantee of\r\nsuccess, and the headquarters of the C. L. S. C. have been extended to\r\ntake in the business of the C. T. C. C. In July we hope to give our\r\nreaders a broader look at this charming club.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe called attention recently to Dr. Warren’s entertaining theory of the\r\nwhereabouts of the garden of Eden.

They deserve the heartiest\r\nsupport of educators and municipal authorities. In Cincinnati there is an\r\nevening high school similar in requirements to the upper grade grammar\r\nschool; in St. Louis one which prepares students for the Polytechnic\r\nschool of Washington University; one in New York which, in 1883, had an\r\naverage attendance of 951 pupils; another in Boston which, in October\r\n1884, enrolled 1,592 pupils. The character and the patronage are proofs\r\nsufficient that such institutions are in demand. A late circular from the\r\nBureau of Education declares that “it is an institution which has come to\r\nstay, and that it has a more important future than can now be understood.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA hopeful sign to temperance workers is the favor with which the\r\nscientific temperance education bill has been meeting in the legislatures\r\nof various states. During the winter of 1884-5 this bill became a law\r\nin Nevada, Alabama, Wisconsin, Missouri, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon,\r\nNebraska, Pennsylvania, and Kansas, making in all fourteen states which\r\nrequire instruction in public schools concerning the physiological\r\neffects of stimulants and narcotics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. L. S. C. NOTES ON REQUIRED READINGS FOR JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nInoculation for cholera is the latest preventive. A number of people have\r\ntried it in Valencia, Spain, and with perfect success, the authorities\r\ncontend. Cholera virus is used. The patient becomes prostrated with a\r\ntumor in about twenty-four hours, but usually recovers in a couple of\r\ndays. Certainly, if as sure as speedy, humanity has found a boon. It will\r\nbe wiser, however, to wait until the cholera attacks Valencia before\r\ntrusting too implicitly to inoculation for cholera.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnbounded curiosity has been displayed at the New Orleans Exposition,\r\nover the “Woman’s Department.” In spite of fate Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and\r\nher co-workers have succeeded in making it a success, and in getting a\r\nfair representation of what women can do. They have a literary department\r\nfilled with scores of volumes written by women, a woman’s exchange,\r\nsamples of ten thousand kinds of fancy work, of course, and, better than\r\nthat, of engraving, wood-carving, drawing, silk culture and weaving; a\r\nnovel niche is made by a display of patents taken out by women, and by\r\nblacksmith work and forging done by women. Could they transport a cottage\r\nwith its inmates and let the work of home-making go on day after day,\r\nthey would add the crown to their department.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the _North American_ makes the remarkable\r\nstatement that women have never been benefited by Christianity, but that\r\ntheir elevation is altogether due to the spread of Teutonic respect\r\nfor noble women. One must naturally conclude that Mrs. Stanton has not\r\nstudied her history thoroughly. Her statements sound very much like an\r\nattempt to build up a theory without respect to the facts in the case.\r\nCertainly no fact is better established than that with the spread of the\r\ndoctrines of Christ came the elevation of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n1. “De Saussure,” sō-sür, Horace Benedict. (1740-1799.) A Swiss\r\nnaturalist who traveled extensively and made valuable contributions\r\nto science. Much of his time and attention were given to mountain\r\nresearches. He constructed the best hygroscope, the instrument which\r\nindicates a change in the degree of moisture in the atmosphere. The\r\ncyanometer, an instrument for measuring the degrees of blueness in the\r\nsky, was also invented by him.\r\n\r\n2. “Osmose.” The tendency of fluids, when placed in contact, to mix.\r\n\r\n3. “Cotyledons.” The seed lobes which surround and nourish young plants.\r\nEndogenous plants, or inside growers, such as Indian corn, have only\r\none cotyledon, while exogens, or plants that grow by making external\r\nadditions, have two, as seen in the young pea.\r\n\r\n4. “Hales,” Stephen. (1677-1761.) An English clergyman who gave much time\r\nto scientific study. He was the author of several works, among which was\r\na book on the physiology of vegetables, entitled “Statical Essays,” which\r\nhas been translated into several languages.\r\n\r\n5. “Dean Trench,” Richard Chevenix. (1807-⸺.) A British clergyman.\r\nIn 1856 he was made Dean of Westminster, and in 1864 Archbishop of\r\nDublin. His publications are numerous, including poetical, theological,\r\nphilological, and historical works.\r\n\r\n6. “Venus fly-trap,” or dionæa. This curious plant is a native of the\r\nsandy bogs of North Carolina. It is a perennial plant, whose leaves grow\r\nfrom its roots. In the midst of them there grows a leafless stem, about\r\nsix inches high, which terminates in a cluster of white flowers. The\r\nlong, slender leaves bear at their extremities a second leaf, which has\r\nbeen compared to two eyelids joined at their bases; this leaf is fringed\r\nwith stiff, bristly hairs, and on the upper surface there are three very\r\ndelicate bristles on each side, so placed that a fly can not walk over\r\nthe leaf without touching one of them. As soon as touched the two parts\r\nof the leaf instantly close over the victim and hold it in their embrace\r\nuntil death follows, and the insect is partly absorbed. The sensitiveness\r\nof the plant resides entirely in these bristles on the surface of the\r\nleaves. The juice from the glands attracts the insects, and the plant\r\nreceives nourishment from their bodies, which are partly dissolved in a\r\nliquid which exudes from the leaves.\r\n\r\n7. “Nepenthes,” or pitcher plants. A genus of plants whose leaves form\r\nreceptacles for water. The plants are natives of the swamps in the\r\nEast Indies and Australia. The linear-lanceolate leaves have at their\r\nextremities a long, spiral stem, at the end of which is attached an urn,\r\nor pitcher, of narrow cylindrical form, from six to twelve inches long,\r\nin the different species, which are of the same color as the leaves, in\r\nsome varieties, in others spotted with red, and still others are of a\r\nblood red color. The pitcher is terminated by a lid which is sometimes\r\nclosed. The pitcher is always partly filled with watery liquid. Honey is\r\nsecreted around the mouth of the pitcher, and insects are found within\r\nit, which have been lured by the honey. These are supposed to contribute\r\nto the nourishment of the plant. For further description, see the\r\narticle on “Borneo,” in the present number of THE CHAUTAUQUAN. There are\r\nsome varieties of the pitcher plant found in the United States.\r\n\r\n8. “Diatoms,” A species of microscopic plants belonging to the Algæ or\r\nsea weeds, growing in both salt and fresh water. For a long time they\r\nwere thought to belong to the animal kingdom, and were classed among the\r\nanimalcules, as they had the strange power of secreting from the water\r\nsilicious shells. They grew in some places in such abundance as to form\r\nlarge beds of their shelly remains, the material of which is used for\r\nthe polishing powders known under the name of tripoli. The species found\r\nnow are exactly like the fossils. Ehrenberg says: “Species are to be\r\nfound, in a living state, in situations where they have been propagated\r\nfrom times far anterior to the existence of man.” They may be obtained\r\nby allowing the water in which they grow to stand for a time, and then\r\npouring off all but the slimy part at the bottom. The diatoms may often\r\nbe seen to move a little in the water, from which it was supposed they\r\nbelonged to the animal kingdom. Professor Bailey describes one very\r\ninteresting species, as follows: “At one moment the needle-shaped\r\nfrustules lie side by side, forming a rectangular plate; suddenly one\r\nof the frustules slides forward a little way, the next slides a little\r\nalso, and so on through the whole number. These motions are constantly\r\ngoing on, and with such rapidity that the eye can scarcely follow them.\r\nThe cause of the motion is wholly unknown, but it is probably mechanical\r\nand not vital.” One species in its growth takes on a fanlike appearance\r\nand is exceedingly beautiful. Fossil diatoms have been found in all the\r\nstrata of rock formations. These with some of the minute creatures of the\r\nanimal kingdom have left greater records of themselves than most of the\r\nhigher forms of life. Extensive deposits of their silicious shells are\r\nfound in various parts of the world. The city of Richmond, Va., stands on\r\na layer of them which is eighteen feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nERRATA.—The first line of the second experiment, page 441 of THE\r\nCHAUTAUQUAN for May, should read: “A body is buoyed up in water by a\r\nforce equal to the weight of the water it displaces.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY READINGS.\r\n\r\n1. “Summerfield,” John. (1798-1825.) An American divine. He was born in\r\nEngland, and moved to New York in 1821. He visited many of the large\r\ncities, where his eloquence drew crowds to listen to his sermons. He\r\nfounded the American Tract Society.\r\n\r\n2. “Krumacher,” Friedrich Adolph. (1768-1845.) An eminent German\r\ntheologian, pastor of the Reformed Church at Crefeld, and later pastor at\r\nBremen. He was the author of many works, both in prose and poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL BIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n1. “Batrachia,” bā-trāˈkĭ-ä.\r\n\r\n2. “Ophidia,” ō-fidˈĭ-ä.\r\n\r\n3. “Lacertilia,” lā-ser-tilˈĭ-ä.\r\n\r\n4. “Iguanodon,” i-guāˈnō-don. This gigantic fossil reptile was discovered\r\nin the year 1882, in the Wealden beds of Kent and Sussex, also in the\r\nIsle of Wight, by Dr. Mantell. The enormous bones were very abundant,\r\nand from a close study of them, it has been estimated that the extreme\r\nlength of the reptile must have been twenty-eight or thirty feet, of\r\nwhich the head was three, and the tail thirteen feet. It stood higher\r\nabove the ground than any reptile now in existence. The teeth, which\r\nbear a remarkable resemblance to the teeth of the American lizard, the\r\niguana, from which it was named, show that the animal was herbivorous.\r\nIt probably fed on the trees growing along the borders of swamps and\r\nstreams, and was able to lift its body for this purpose on its hind legs.\r\n\r\n5. “Megˌa-lo-sauˈrus.” The word comes from the Greek, as do nearly all\r\nthe words in this list, and means great lizard. The bones found in the\r\nrocks of the Oolite formation, the one next below the Wealden, show the\r\nanimal to have been terrestrial and carnivorous. It fed upon smaller\r\nreptiles and the young of the larger orders. Its huge body was supported\r\non four large, strong legs, the hind ones being estimated to have had a\r\nlength of nearly six feet. The length of the animal must have been thirty\r\nor forty feet. In the first estimates made of all these saurians, their\r\nsize was overestimated, the body of the iguanodon having been given as\r\nseventy feet in length, and the megalosaurus as sixty or seventy feet.\r\n\r\n6. “Pleˌsi-o-sauˈrus.” The word means like a lizard. It is a remarkable\r\nfossil sea-reptile, which shows a long, snake-like neck, in which there\r\nare thirty-three vertebræ, ten more than in the longest neck of any\r\nbird. The body and head are comparatively short. Its whole length, when\r\nliving, was probably twenty-five or thirty feet. Buckland describes it\r\nas follows: “To the head of a lizard it united the teeth of a crocodile,\r\na neck of enormous length, resembling the body of a serpent, a trunk\r\nand tail having the proportions of an ordinary quadruped; the ribs of\r\na chameleon, and the paddles of a whale.” There were fifty teeth in\r\neach jaw. Conybeare says of it: “That it was marine is evident from its\r\npaddles; that it may have occasionally visited the shore, the resemblance\r\nof its extremities to those of the turtle may lead us to conjecture;\r\nits motion must have been, however, very awkward on land; its neck must\r\nhave impeded its progress through the water. May it not therefore be\r\nconcluded—since, in addition to these circumstances, its respiration must\r\nhave required frequent access to the air—that it swam upon or near the\r\nsurface, arching back its neck like the swan, and occasionally darting\r\nit down at the fish which happened to float within its reach? It may,\r\nperhaps, have lurked in shoal water along the coast, concealed among the\r\nsea weed, and, raising its nostrils to the surface from a considerable\r\ndepth, may have found a sure retreat from the assaults of dangerous\r\nenemies, while the flexibility of its neck may have compensated for the\r\nwant of strength in its jaws and its incapacity for swift motion through\r\nthe water, by the suddenness and agility of the attack which it enabled\r\nit to make on every animal fitted for its prey which came within its\r\nreach.”\r\n\r\n7. “Ichˈthy-o-sauˈrus” (fish-lizard). This animal, which also is known\r\nonly by its fossil remains, must have been about thirty feet long. It had\r\nenormous eyes, a long and large head, a mouth armed with powerful teeth,\r\nand a short neck. The body was fish-like in form, and the four paddles,\r\nresembling those of a whale, were comparatively small. The tail was long\r\nand gradually flattened toward the end; it was the principal organ of\r\nlocomotion. They were very active in their movements, and consequently\r\nwere dangerous enemies to all other animals living in the sea. Their food\r\nconsisted chiefly of fishes.\r\n\r\n8. “Chelonia,” kē-loˈnĭ-ä.\r\n\r\n9. “Loricata,” lŏrˌi-cāˈtä.\r\n\r\n10. “Aves,” āˈvēs.\r\n\r\n11. “Anchylosed,” angˈkī-losed.

It wasn’t hard wi’ t’ promise I’d got.”\r\n\r\nThen Phyllis took a chair and stood upon it and carefully lifted down the\r\ntea-pot. It was of coarse blue and white pottery, and had been made in\r\nStaffordshire when the art was emerging from its rudeness, and when the\r\npeople were half barbarous and wholly irreligious—one of half a dozen\r\nthat are now worth more than if made of the rarest china, the “Blue\r\nWesley Tea-pot;” rude little objects, yet formed by loving, reverential\r\nhands to commemorate the apostolic labors of John Wesley in that almost\r\nsavage district. His likeness was on one side, and on the other the\r\nwords, so often in his mouth, “In God we trust.”—_From “The Hallam\r\nSuccession,” by Amelia E. Barr._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDiscriminate in the use of AND and TO. Instead of saying “Go _and_ see\r\nthem before you leave;” “Try _and_ help him obtain a place;” “Come _and_\r\nmeet our friends at my house;” say “Go _to_,” “Try _to_,” and “Come _to_.”\r\n\r\nDiscriminate in the use of the word ARTIST. Keep _artist_ to designate\r\nthe higher order of workmen; as painters, sculptors, musicians,\r\narchitects, and the like. Don’t use it to designate barbers, laundrymen,\r\ntailors, etc.\r\n\r\nDiscriminate in the use of BAD. Don’t say “I have a _bad_ cold;” say “a\r\n_severe_ cold.” As colds are never _good_, we should not say they are\r\n_bad_. We can have _slight_ colds, or _severe_ colds, but not _bad_ colds.\r\n\r\nDiscriminate between BAD and BADLY. Don’t make the mistake, so frequently\r\nmade, of saying “I feel very _badly_.” Use _bad_. _Badly_ is an adverb,\r\nand should not be employed. One might as well say “I feel _happily_,”\r\ninstead of _happy_.\r\n\r\nDiscriminate between BALANCE and REMAINDER or REST. Don’t say “The\r\n_balance_ of the library remained unsold;” “He spent the _balance_ of\r\nthe evening at home;” “The _balance_ of the money he left in their\r\nkeeping;” “We will now have the _balance_ of the toasts.” Use _rest_ or\r\n_remainder_. Balance denotes the excess of one thing over another.\r\n\r\nDiscriminate in the use of DEPOT. The best critics contend that we should\r\nnot call a _railway-station_ a _depot_.

The Russian\r\ndespotism must and will be destroyed; for it is not permitted to the\r\nstupid obstinacy of one, nor to the infamous egotism of a few, to\r\narrest the progress and light of a nation of a hundred million souls.\r\nWe can only wish the mode of execution of the unavoidable may be the\r\nleast disastrous, least sanguinary, and most humane. And there is a\r\nforce which can strongly contribute to this—it is the public opinion of\r\nEuropean countries. It is strange, but quite true; Russian governmental\r\ncircles are much more impressed by what is said about them in Europe than\r\nby the wailing of all Russia from the White Sea down to the Euxine.—_From\r\n“Russia Under the Tzars,” by Stepniak._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN PRIME OF ’49.—A knowledge of the characteristic features of\r\nthe mining days of 1849 is essential to a full appreciation of the good\r\nsense and political wisdom shown by the miners as a class. Merchants,\r\nmechanics, farmers existed but to supply the miners; and the gold of\r\nthe mines was the chief resource of California. Four fifths of the\r\nable-bodied male population were living in the mineral belt, or were on\r\ntheir way thither, when the working season of 1849 opened. Only four\r\nyears before there had been but five hundred Americans in California;\r\nin February, 1848, but two thousand; by December, 1848, this number\r\nhad grown to six thousand; by July, 1849, to fifteen thousand; and by\r\nDecember, 1849, to fifty-three thousand. Chiefly owing to the gold rush\r\nof 1848-53 the center of population of the United States moved eighty-one\r\nmiles farther west. Within four years after the spring of 1849 the\r\npopulation of the new state was 300,000, and more than $260,000,000 had\r\nbeen dug from the gold fields.—_From Charles Howard Shinn’s “Mining\r\nCamps.”_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE WISE MAN’S VIEW OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n      “Look on the Spirit as the rider! take\r\n    The Body for the chariot, and the Will\r\n    As charioteer! regard the Mind as reins,\r\n    The Senses the steeds, and the things of sense\r\n    The ways they trample on.

We worked early and late, being careful to have dresses\r\nshort enough not to injure the vines. It was hard work for our bent,\r\nweary backs, as it grew warm, but we knew it must be done. Mother, Janet,\r\nWill and Pete did good service, and little Cecy cheered us from her wagon\r\nunder a neighboring tree.\r\n\r\nIn about five weeks the harvest was over, and after taking breath, we\r\ncounted our gains.\r\n\r\n                             DR.\r\n\r\n    Cost of plants (3,630)            $11 80\r\n    Cost of picking                    10 25\r\n                                      ------\r\n        Total                         $22 05\r\n\r\n                             CR.\r\n\r\n    By 1,178 quarts of berries, at an average\r\n      of 15c. per qt.                          $176 70\r\n                                               -------\r\n        Net profit on one quarter acre         $154 65\r\n\r\nIf we had to pay expenses of plowing, weeding, manure, etc., it would\r\nhave greatly lessened the profits.

Price, 30 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALK ABOUT BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA happy thought was carried into successful execution in the publication\r\nof “The Hundred Greatest Men.”[N] The editor conceived the idea that a\r\n“natural history of civilization ought to be, not so much a narration of\r\nevents, as a description of men and things,” and hence for many years\r\nbusied himself in making a collection of portraits and antiquities as a\r\npreparation for his work. The great men of all ages have been grouped\r\ninto eight classes, and treated under the following divisions of the\r\nbook: Poetry, art, religion, philosophy, history, science, politics, and\r\nindustry. Introductions have been written for these different departments\r\nby Matthew Arnold, Taine, Max Müller, Rénan, Noah Porter, Dean Stanley,\r\nProf. Helmholtz, J. A. Froude, and John Fiske. The general introduction\r\nis by Emerson. Only those characters have been selected who have stood\r\nthe test of time without diminution of fame. A portrait accompanies each\r\nsketch, and many of these have been obtained at great expense of time and\r\ntrouble. The sketches themselves are word-paintings of the character,\r\nthe life, and the times of the men, and the wonder is that in such brief\r\nspace so much information can be given. The volume is a veritable art\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nA story of much delicacy of touch, and with some strong delineation\r\nof character, is “The Hallam Succession”[O] of Amelia C. Barr. The\r\nplacing of the story could hardly be more picturesque. Mrs. Barr opens\r\nwith English life of the first of the present century, carries us to a\r\nplantation near New Orleans, through “Sam” Houston’s Texan struggles,\r\nand finally to the long, low, verandahed house of a Texas plantation.\r\nThe varied setting gives the variety to a story of faithful love and\r\ndevotion. The many pleasing touches given in the descriptions of the\r\ncharacters are the finest features of the book. A fair example is the\r\nparagraph quoted on another page of this impression, which in its true\r\nand delicate pathos is rarely equaled.\r\n\r\nOne or two selections taken from “The Harnt that Walks the Chilhowee,”\r\none of the eight stories that make up the volume, “In The Tennessee\r\nMountains,”[P] will show the style and aim of these unique writings,\r\nwhich are just now attracting so much attention. This “harnt,” or ghost,\r\nwas supposed to be that of a poor, deformed little creature, who some\r\ntime before had been shot, and, as every one thought, killed. He himself\r\nhad been falsely accused of taking a man’s life. His death, however, had\r\nbeen a mistake, and it was the real man who walked the mountain in search\r\nof food. Simon Burney, an “uncouth and densely ignorant” mountaineer,\r\nsought out the helpless, forlorn little specter, for whose capture\r\n$200 reward had been offered, and said: “I ain’t a-goin’ ter help no\r\nman break the law an’ hender jestice; but ef ye will go an’ stand yer\r\ntrial I’ll take keer of ye. An’ arter the jury hev done let ye off, ye\r\nare welcome ter live along o’ me at my house till ye die.” And after\r\nthe trial and the clearance, this rough friend was as good as his word,\r\nand “ungrudgingly gave of his best … and worked early and late that\r\nthere might be enough to divide.” “A prince could not have dispensed\r\nhospitality with a more royal hand.” The author closes by saying: “The\r\ngrace of culture is, in its way, a fine thing, but the best that art can\r\ndo—the polish of a gentleman—is hardly equal to the best that nature can\r\ndo in her highest moods.” All of the stories are full of interest, and\r\nshow great love for humanity. The author, in a bright, cheery way, true\r\nto the life which she represents, portrays the strong and noble natures\r\nfound in the lowest walks of life.\r\n\r\n“A Book of Sermons,”[Q] by Bishop Simpson, will meet with a warm welcome\r\neverywhere. To those who have heard him preach, who have listened to\r\nhis eager, impassioned words, and have been borne onward by the tide\r\nof his eloquence, it may seem that to merely read the words—to have\r\nthem without the powerful influence, the magnetic personality, behind\r\nthem—is to possess the letter without the spirit. But such will be\r\nhappily surprised. The book bears witness that Bishop Simpson was a\r\ngreat sermonizer, as well as a great speaker. By the aid of a little\r\nimagination as one reads, he can see again the spare form, and the face\r\nlighted up with enthusiasm and love; can hear the voice rapidly and\r\nearnestly uttering the words which point out plainly and simply the way\r\nof life. While, without this help, those who never heard him will find\r\ngreat pleasure and profit in reading the book.\r\n\r\nNo one who knows Dr. Buckley but expects good things from his pen, and\r\nhe has given to young men a particularly useful volume in “Oats or\r\nWild-Oats?”[R] Advice is as difficult a thing to prescribe judiciously\r\nas it is to take pleasantly. It is very liable to be insipid, preachy,\r\nto lack _verve_ qualities, which young men particularly abominate; it is\r\nvery little of it readable. But these talks of Dr. Buckley’s abound in\r\nreadable qualities. They are directly to the point, and full of clear-cut\r\ncommon sense. They advise young men in the practical matter of choosing\r\na profession, and in making a success of it. The talks come from a man\r\nwho, even if he “never worked a half day on a farm in his life,” has\r\nobserved and conversed with hundreds of farmers; who knows from what he\r\nhas heard and learned from their confessions to him just where they make\r\ntheir business, social, intellectual, and religious mistakes; and who is\r\nnot afraid to express what he believes to be their dangers, and their\r\nstrong points. As with farming, so with all the trades and professions.\r\nHe knows his ground, and treats it in a tone a trifle blunt, perhaps, but\r\nnevertheless full of force and conviction.\r\n\r\nMr. Marvin, an Englishman who for several years has lived in Russia,\r\nand is thoroughly acquainted with the character, the policy, and the\r\nwishes of that government, has, in writing “The Russians at the Gates\r\nof Herat,”[S] tried to impress more deeply upon the English people the\r\nnecessity of immediate effort in order to secure themselves in the\r\npossession of the entrance to India. The steady advance of Russia for\r\nyears past toward this empire has been carefully traced, and all the\r\ntreacherous devices by which she has gained ground are exposed. The\r\npopular opinion that colossal mountain ranges lie between the Russian\r\npossessions and India has been shown to be an error; the new route\r\nover which they are passing is such that one could “drive all the way\r\nfour-in-hand.” “No surrender,” must be the motto of every Englishman\r\nas regards Penjdeh, and “Hands off,” in respect to all places leading\r\ndirectly to Herat, says the author. A careful study of this book will\r\ngive one a clear idea of this complicated movement.\r\n\r\nThe “Old Farm”[T] was one that had been for years without a tenant, for\r\nits owner feared to lease it lest its old fashioned house and belongings\r\nmight not suit the new comer, and he would want it changed. At last one\r\nwas found willing, glad to take it just as it was. One bright October\r\nday a business man from the great city, broken down in health, took\r\npossession of it with his family. “A year of retirement and rest will\r\nrestore his vigor and save him for the future,” said the doctor. Very\r\nsoon the early tastes of the naturalist, for such he had been, awoke,\r\nand the days were spent in seeking, gathering and studying specimens of\r\nminute animal life, or “the other tenants of the farm,” as he called\r\nthem. The conversations held regarding them make up the main part of the\r\nwork. Spiders, moths, bees, wasps, and ants are among those described at\r\nlength; their history and habits are very accurately given. The blending\r\nof the story with the natural history makes an exceedingly interesting\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n[N] The Hundred Greatest Men. With Portraits, reproduced from Fine and\r\nRare Steel Engravings.

Chancellor\r\nVincent, Superintendent of Instruction, and other officers of the C. L.\r\nS. C. will be present, and a large number of the pupils of the young\r\nand vigorous “People’s College,” representing all parts of the country,\r\nfrom the ocean to the Rocky Mountains, are expected to witness and\r\ntake part in the interesting exercises while enjoying the amenities of\r\nthat charming seaside town. There is, at Ocean Grove, a local circle\r\ncomprising a membership of nearly sixty. Many of the members are as full\r\nof enthusiasm as our honored superintendent, with all his deep devotion\r\nto the institution he has conducted to such a high degree of prosperity\r\nand usefulness, can desire, and the necessary preparations for the\r\n“Chautauqua day” will be made under its direction. The president of the\r\nOcean Grove Association, the Rev. Dr. E. H. Stokes, is also president of\r\nthe local circle. He is a zealous Chautauquan, and to his influence and\r\nexample must be attributed much of the zeal, industry and enthusiasm that\r\nhave made the local circle so interesting and profitable to members and\r\nvisitors. All members of the class of ’85 who can not go to Chautauqua\r\nto receive their diplomas within the sacred shades of our beloved _alma\r\nmater_, but may be able to make a visit for the purpose to Ocean Grove,\r\nwill be cordially welcomed, and it is suggested that they will do well to\r\ngive as early notice as practicable of their intentions in that regard.\r\nCommunications on the subject should be addressed to the Secretary of the\r\nOcean Grove Local Circle, Mrs. Lulu Pile Little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT TO MEMBERS OF THE C. L. S. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Chautauqua Assembly Daily Herald_ will be printed in the grove at\r\nChautauqua, and issued as a morning paper in August, 1885. It will begin\r\nSaturday, August 1, and continue every day for nineteen days. Nobody\r\ncan keep well informed on the Chautauqua movement without the _Assembly\r\nHerald_. It will tell you nearly everything that is done. It will cost\r\n$1.00 for the season, and it will contain stenographic reports of all the\r\nscientific, philosophical, and other lectures delivered at the Chautauqua\r\nmeetings, together with elaborate reports of all meetings held there the\r\ncoming season. The price is very low. The _Assembly Daily Herald_ and\r\nTHE CHAUTAUQUAN at one time, $2.25. This offer is good only till August\r\n1st. Members of the C. L. S. C. will find a great many valuable hints and\r\nsuggestions in the reports of meetings published in the _Assembly Daily\r\nHerald_, also more than seventy splendid lectures. Some “local circles”\r\nuse the _Herald_ to assist them in conducting their work during the\r\nwinter months.
