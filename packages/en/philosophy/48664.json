His father,\r\neldest brother, and cousins were slain in the massacre by which\r\nConstantius, Constantine II., and Constans secured the empire for\r\nthemselves on the death of their father Constantine in 337. Julian and his\r\nelder brother Gallus spent a precarious childhood and youth, of which six\r\nyears were passed in close confinement in the remote castle of Macellum in\r\nCappadocia, and their position was hardly more secure when, in 350, Gallus\r\nwas elevated to the Caesarship by Constantius, who, after the violent\r\ndeaths of his two brothers, was now sole ruler of the empire. But Julian\r\nwas allowed to pursue his favourite studies in Greek literature and\r\nphilosophy, partly at Nicomedia and Athens, partly in the cities of Asia\r\nMinor, and he was deeply influenced by Maximus of Ephesus, the occult\r\nphilosopher, Libanius of Nicomedia, the fashionable sophist, and\r\nThemistius the Aristotelian commentator, the only genuine philosopher\r\namong the sophists of the fourth century A.D.\r\n\r\nWhen the excesses of the revolutionary Gallus ended in his death at the\r\nhands of Constantius, Julian, an awkward and retiring student, was\r\nsummoned to the court at Milan, where he was protected by the Empress\r\nEusebia from the suspicions of Constantius and the intrigues of hostile\r\ncourtiers. Constantius had no heir to continue the dynasty of the\r\nConstantii. He therefore raised Julian to the Caesarship in 355, gave him\r\nhis sister Helena in marriage, and dispatched him to Gaul to pacify the\r\nGallic provinces. To the surprise of all, Julian in four successive\r\ncampaigns against the Franks and the Alemanis proved himself a good\r\nsoldier and a popular general. His _Commentaries_ on these campaigns are\r\npraised by Eunapius(2) and Libanius,(3) but are not now extant. In 357‐358\r\nConstantius, who was occupied by wars against the Quadi and the\r\nSarmatians, and threatened with a renewal of hostilities by the Persian\r\nking Sapor, ordered Julian, who was then at Paris, to send to his aid the\r\nbest of the Gallic legions. Julian would have obeyed, but his troops,\r\nunwilling to take service in the East, mutinied and proclaimed him Emperor\r\n(359 A.D.). Julian issued manifestoes justifying his conduct to the\r\nSenates of Rome and Athens and to the Spartans and Corinthians, a\r\ncharacteristic anachronism, since their opinion no longer had any weight.\r\nIt was not till 361 that he began his march eastward to encounter the army\r\nof Constantius. His troops, though seasoned and devoted, were in numbers\r\nno match for the legions of his cousin. But the latter, while marching\r\nthrough Cilicia to oppose his advance, died suddenly of a fever near\r\nTarsus, and Julian, now in his thirtieth year, succeeded peacefully to the\r\nthrone and made a triumphal entry into Constantinople in December, 361.\r\n\r\nThe eunuchs and courtiers who had surrounded Constantius were replaced by\r\nsophists and philosophers, and in the next six months Julian set on foot\r\nnumerous economic and administrative reforms. He had long been secretly\r\ndevoted to the Pagan religion, and he at once proclaimed the restoration\r\nof the Pagan gods and the temple worship. Christianity he tolerated, and\r\nin his brief reign of sixteen months the Christians were not actively\r\npersecuted. His treatise _Against the Christians_, which survives only in\r\nfragments, was an explanation of his apostasy. The epithet “Apostate” was\r\nbestowed on him by the Christian Fathers. Meanwhile he was preparing—first\r\nat Constantinople then at Antioch, where he wrote the _Misopogon_, a\r\nsatire on the luxury and frivolity of the inhabitants—for a campaign\r\nagainst Sapor, a task which he had inherited from Constantius. In March,\r\n362 he left Antioch and crossed the Euphrates, visited Carrhae, memorable\r\nfor the defeat of Crassus, then crossed the Tigris, and, after burning his\r\nfleet, retired northwards towards Armenia. On the march he fought an\r\nindecisive battle with the Persians at Maranga, and in a skirmish with the\r\nretreating enemy he was mortally wounded by a javelin (January 26th, 363).\r\nHis body was carried to Tarsus by his successor the Emperor Jovian, and\r\nwas probably removed later to Constantinople. The legend that as he died\r\nhe exclaimed: Γαλιλαῖε νενίκηκας, “Thou hast conquered, O Galilæan!”\r\nappears first in the Christian historian Theodoret in the fifth century.\r\nJulian was the last male descendant of the famous dynasty founded by\r\nConstantius Chlorus.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his military achievements, he was, first of all, a student.\r\nEven on his campaigns he took his books with him, and several of his\r\nextant works were composed in camp. He had been trained, according to the\r\nfashion of his times, in rhetorical studies by professional sophists such\r\nas Libanius, and he has all the mannerisms of a fourth century sophist. It\r\nwas the sophistic etiquette to avoid the direct use of names, and Julian\r\nnever names the usurpers Magnentius, Silvanus, and Vetranio, whose\r\nsuppression by Constantius he describes in his two first _Orations_,\r\nregularly refers to Sapor as “the barbarian,” and rather than name\r\nMardonius, his tutor, calls him “a certain Scythian who had the same name\r\nas the man who persuaded Xerxes to invade Hellas.”(4) He wrote the\r\nliterary Greek of the fourth century A.D. which imitates the classical\r\nstyle, though barbarisms and late constructions are never entirely\r\navoided. His pages are crowded with echoes of Homer, Demosthenes, Plato,\r\nand Isocrates, and his style is interwoven with half verses, phrases, and\r\nwhole sentences taken without acknowledgment from the Greek masterpieces.\r\nIt is certain that, like other sophists, he wished his readers to\r\nrecognise these echoes, and therefore his source is always classical, so\r\nthat where he seems to imitate Dio Chrysostom or Themistius, both go back\r\nto a common source, which Julian had in mind. Another sophistic element in\r\nhis style is the use of commonplaces, literary allusions that had passed\r\ninto the sophistic language and can be found in all the writers of\r\nreminiscence Greek in his day. He himself derides this practice(5) but he\r\ncannot resist dragging in the well‐worn references to Cyrus, Darius, and\r\nAlexander, to the nepenthe poured out by Helen in the _Odyssey_, to the\r\ndefiance of nature by Xerxes, or the refusal of Socrates to admit the\r\nhappiness of the Great King. Julian wished to make Neo‐Platonism the\r\nphilosophy of his revived Hellenism, but he belonged to the younger or\r\nSyrian branch of the school, of which Iamblichus was the real founder, and\r\nhe only once mentions Plotinus. Iamblichus he ranked with Plato and paid\r\nhim a fanatical devotion. His philosophical writing, especially in the two\r\nprose _Hymns_, is obscure, partly because his theories are only vaguely\r\nrealised, partly because he reproduces the obscurity of his model,\r\nIamblichus. In satire and narrative he can be clear and straightforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManuscripts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Vossianus_ (V), Leyden, 13th or 14th cent.

But\r\nthe vast scale of your exploits deterred me, because what I had to dread\r\nwas not that my words would fall somewhat short of your achievements, but\r\nthat I should prove wholly unequal to my theme. That men versed in\r\npolitical debate, or poets, should find it easy to compose a panegyric on\r\nyour career is not at all surprising. Their practice in speaking, their\r\nhabit of declaiming in public supplies them abundantly with a well‐\r\nwarranted confidence. But those who have neglected this field and chosen\r\nanother branch of literary study which devotes itself to a form of\r\ncomposition little adapted to win popular favour and that has not the\r\nhardihood to exhibit itself in its nakedness in every theatre, no matter\r\nwhat, would naturally hesitate to make speeches of the epideictic sort. As\r\nfor the poets, their Muse, and the general belief that it is she who\r\ninspires their verse, obviously gives them unlimited license to invent. To\r\nrhetoricians the art of rhetoric allows just as much freedom; fiction is\r\ndenied them, but flattery is by no means forbidden, nor is it counted a\r\ndisgrace to the orator that the object of his panegyric should not deserve\r\nit. Poets who compose and publish some legend that no one had thought of\r\nbefore increase their reputation, because an audience is entertained by\r\nthe mere fact of novelty. Orators, again, assert(11) that the advantage of\r\ntheir art is that it can treat a slight theme in the grand manner, and\r\nagain, by the use of mere words, strip the greatness from deeds, and, in\r\nshort, marshall the power of words against that of facts.)\r\n\r\nἘγὼ δὲ εἰ μὲν ἑώρων ταύτης ἐμαυτὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος ἐν χρείᾳ τῆς τέχνης,\r\nἦγον ἂν τὴν προσήκουσαν ἡσυχίαν τοῖς ἀμελετήτως ἔχουσι τῶν τοιούτων λόγων,\r\n[D] παραχωρῶν τῶν σῶν ἐγκωμίων ἐκείνοις, ὧν μικρῷ πρόσθεν ἐμνήσθην. ἐπεὶ\r\nδὲ ἅπαν τοὐναντίον ὁ παρὼν ἀπαιτεῖ λόγος τῶν πραγμάτων ἁπλῆν διήγησιν\r\nοὐδενὸς ἐπεισάκτου κόσμου δεομένην, ἔδοξε κἀμοὶ προσήκειν, τοῦ(12) ἀξίως\r\nδιηγήσασθαι τῶν ἔργων ἀνεφίκτου καὶ τοῖς προλαβοῦσιν(13) ἤδη φανέντος.\r\nἅπαντες γὰρ σχεδὸν οἱ [3] περὶ παιδείαν διατρίβοντες σε(14) ἐν μέτρῳ καὶ\r\nκαταλογάδην ὑμνοῦσιν, οἱ μὲν ἅπαντα περιλαβεῖν ἐν βραχεῖ τολμῶντες, οἱ δὲ\r\nμέρεσιν αὑτοὺς ἐπιδόντες τῶν πράξεων ἀρκεῖν ᾠήθησαν, εἰ τούτων τῆς ἀξίας\r\nμὴ διαμάρτοιεν. ἄξιον δὲ ἄγασθαι τὴν προθυμίαν τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἁπάντων, ὅσοι\r\nτῶν σῶν ἐπαίνων ἥψαντο. οἱ μὲν γάρ, ὅπως μηδὲν ὑπὸ τοῦ χρόνου τῶν σοι\r\nπραχθέντων ἀμαυρωθείη, τὸν μέγιστον ὑποδῦναι πόνον ἐτόλμησαν, οἱ δέ, ὅτι\r\nτοῦ παντὸς διαμαρτήσειν ἤλπιζον, τὴν αὑτῶν γνώμην ἐν μέρει προύφηναν, [B]\r\nἄμεινον τοῦ τῆς σιωπῆς ἀκινδύνου γέρως κρίναντες κατὰ δύναμίν σοι τῶν\r\nοἰκείων πόνων ἀπάρξασθαι.\r\n\r\n(If, however, I had seen that on this occasion I should need their art, I\r\nshould have maintained the silence that befits those who have had no\r\npractice in such forms of composition, and should leave your praises to be\r\ntold by those whom I just now mentioned. Since, on the contrary, the\r\nspeech I am to make calls for a plain narrative of the facts and needs no\r\nadventitious ornament, I thought that even I was not unfit, seeing that my\r\npredecessors had already shown that it was beyond them to produce a record\r\nworthy of your achievements. For almost all who devote themselves to\r\nliterature attempt to sing your praises in verse or prose; some of them\r\nventure to cover your whole career in a brief narrative, while others\r\ndevote themselves to a part only, and think that if they succeed in doing\r\njustice to that part they have proved themselves equal to the task.)\r\n\r\nΕἰ μὲν οὖν καὶ αὐτὸς εἷς ὢν ἐτύγχανον τῶν τοὺς ἐπιδεικτικοὺς ἀγαπώντων\r\nλόγους, ἐχρῆν ἐντεῦθεν ἄρχεσθαι τῆς ὑποθέσεως, τὴν ἴσην εὔνοιαν\r\nἀπαιτήσαντα τῆς ὑπαρχούσης ἤδη σοι παρ᾽ ἡμῶν καὶ δεηθέντα τῶν λόγων\r\nἀκροατὴν εὐμενῆ γενέσθαι, οὐχὶ δὲ ἀκριβῆ καὶ ἀπαραίτητον κριτὴν\r\nκαταστῆναι. [C] ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐν ἄλλοις μαθήμασι τραφέντες καὶ παιδευθέντες,\r\nκαθάπερ ἐπιτηδεύμασι καὶ νόμοις, ἀλλοτρίων κατατολμᾶν ἔργων δοκοῦμεν οὐκ\r\nὀρθῶς, μικρά μοι δοκεῖ χρῆναι καὶ περὶ τούτων δηλῶσαι, οἰκειοτέραν ἀρχὴν\r\nπροθέντα τοῦ λόγου.\r\n\r\n(Yet one can but admire the zeal of all who have made you the theme of a\r\npanegyric. Some did not shrink from the tremendous effort to secure every\r\none of your achievements from the withering touch of time; others, because\r\nthey foresaw that they could not compass the whole, expressed themselves\r\nonly in part, and chose to consecrate to you their individual work so far\r\nas they were able. Better this, they thought, than “the reward of silence\r\nthat runs no risk.”(15) Now if I were one of those whose favourite pursuit\r\nis epideictic oratory, I should have to begin my speech by asking from you\r\nno less goodwill than I now feel towards yourself, and should beg you\r\ngraciously to incline your ear to my words and not play the part of a\r\nsevere and inexorable critic. But since, bred as I have been and educated\r\nin other studies, other pursuits, other conventions, I am criticised for\r\nventuring rashly into fields that belong to others, I feel that I ought to\r\nexplain myself briefly on this head and begin my speech more after my own\r\nfashion.)\r\n\r\nΝόμος ἐστὶ παλαιὸς παρὰ τοῦ πρώτου φιλοσοφίαν ἀνθρώποις φήναντος οὑτωσὶ\r\nκείμενος· ἅπαντας [D] πρὸς τὴν ἀρετὴν καὶ πρὸς τὸ καλὸν βλέποντας\r\nἐπιτηδεύειν ἐν λόγοις, ἐν ἔργοις, ἐν ξυνουσίαις, ἐν πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς τοῖς κατὰ\r\nτὸν βίον μικροῖς καὶ μείζοσι τοῦ καλοῦ πάντως ἐφίεσθαι. πάντων δὲ ὅτι\r\nκάλλιστον ἀρετή, τίς ἂν ἡμῖν τῶν νοῦν ἐχόντων ἀμφισβητήσειε; ταύτης τοίνυν\r\nἀντέχεσθαι διακελεύεται τοὺς μὴ μάτην τουτὶ περιοίσοντας τοὔνομα, προσῆκον\r\nοὐδὲν αὐτοῖς σφετερισαμένους. ταῦτα δὲ διαγορεύων ὁ νόμος οὐδεμίαν ἰδέαν\r\nἐπιτάττει λόγων, οὐδ᾽ ὥσπερ ἔκ τινος τραγικῆς μηχανῆς, φησὶ, χρῆναι\r\nπροαγορεύει τοῖς ἐντυγχάνουσ [4] σπεύδειν μὲν πρὸς τὴν ἀρετήν, ἀποφεύγειν\r\nδὲ τὴν πονηρίαν, ἀλλὰ πολλαῖς ὁδοῖς ἐπὶ τοῦτο δίδωσι χρῆσθαι τῷ βουληθέντι\r\nμιμεῖσθαι τὴν ἐκείνου φύσιν. καὶ γὰρ παραίνεσιν ἀγαθὴν καὶ λόγων\r\nπροτρεπτικῶν χρῆσιν καὶ τὸ μετ᾽ εὐνοίας ἐπιπλήττειν τοῖς ἁμαρτήμασιν\r\nἐπαινεῖν τε αὖ τὰ καλῶς πραχθέντα καὶ ψέγειν, ὅταν ᾖ καιρός, τὰ μὴ [B]\r\nτοιαῦτα τῶν ἔργων. ἐφίησι δὲ καὶ(16) ταῖς ἄλλαις ἰδεαις, εἴ τις ἐθέλοι,\r\nπρὸς τὸ βέλτιστον τῶν λόγων χρῆσθαι, ἐπὶ παντὶ δὲ οἶμαι καὶ λόγῳ καὶ\r\nπράξει μεμνῆσθαι προστάττων, ὅπῃ τούτων ὑφέξουσιν εὐθύνας, ὧν ἂν τύχωσιν\r\nεἰπόντες, λέγειν δὲ οὐδὲν ὅ τι μὴ πρὸς ἀρετὴν καὶ φιλοσοφίαν ἀνοίσουσι. τὰ\r\nμὲν οὖν ἐκ τοῦ νόμου ταῦτα καὶ τοιαῦτα ἕτερα.\r\n\r\n(There is an ancient maxim taught by him who first introduced philosophy\r\nto mankind, and it is as follows. All who aspire to virtue and the\r\nbeautiful must study in their words, deeds, conversation, in short, in all\r\nthe affairs of life, great and small, to aim in every way at beauty. Now\r\nwhat sensible man would deny that virtue is of all things the most\r\nbeautiful? Wherefore those are bidden to lay firm hold on her who do not\r\nseek to blazon abroad her name in vain, appropriating that which in no way\r\nbelongs to them. Now in giving this counsel, the maxim does not prescribe\r\nany single type of discourse, nor does it proclaim to its readers, like a\r\ngod from the machine in tragedy, “Ye must aspire to virtue and eschew\r\nevil.” Many are the paths that it allows a man to follow to this goal, if\r\nhe desire to imitate the nature of the beautiful. For example, he may give\r\ngood advice, or use hortatory discourse, or he may rebuke error without\r\nmalice, or applaud what is well done, or condemn, on occasion, what is ill\r\ndone. It permits men also to use other types of oratory, if they please,\r\nso as to attain the best end of speech, but it enjoins on them to take\r\nthought in every word and act how they shall give account of all they\r\nutter, and to speak no word that cannot be referred to the standard of\r\nvirtue and philosophy. That and more to the same effect is the tenour of\r\nthat precept.)\r\n\r\nἩμεῖς δὲ ἄρα τί ποτε δράσομεν, εἰργόμενοι μὲν τῷ δοκεῖν ποιεῖσθαι πρὸς\r\nχάριν τὴν εὐφημίαν, [C] τοῦ γένους δὲ ἤδη τῶν ἐπαίνων διὰ τούς οὐκ ὀρθῶς\r\nμετιόντας ὑπόπτου καθεστῶτος δεινῶς, καὶ κολακείας ἀγεννοῦς, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ\r\nμαρτυρίας ἀληθοῦς τῶν ἀρίστων ἔργων εἶναι νομισθέντος; ἢ δῆλον ὅτι τῇ περὶ\r\nτὸν ἐπαινούμενον ἀρετῇ πεπιστευκότες ἐπιδώσομεν ἑαυτοὺς θαρροῦντες τοῖς\r\nἐγκωμίοις; τίς ἂν οὖν ἡμῖν ἀρχὴ καὶ τάξις τοῦ λόγου γένοιτο καλλίστη; [D]\r\nἢ δῆλον ὡς ἡ τῶν προγόνων ἀρετή, δι᾽ ἣν ὑπῆρξέ σοι καὶ τὸ τοιούτῳ\r\nγενέσθαι; τροφῆς δὲ οἶμαι καὶ παιδείας ἑξῆς προσήκει μνησθῆναι, ἥπερ σοι\r\nτὸ πλεῖστον εἰς τῆν ὑπάρχουσαν ἀρετὴν συνεισηνέγκατο, ἐφ᾽ ἅπασι δὲ τούτοις\r\nὥσπερ γνωρίσματα τῶν τῆς ψυχῆς ἀρετῶν τὰς πράξεις διελθεῖν, καὶ τέλος\r\nἐπιτιθέντα τῷ λόγῳ τὰς ἕξεις δηλῶσαι, ὅθεν ὁρμώμενος τὰ κάλλιστα τῶν ἔργων\r\nἔδρασας καὶ ἐβουλεύσω.

What embarrasses me is the fact that, if I\r\npraise you, I shall be thought simply to curry favour, and in fact, the\r\ndepartment of panegyric has come to incur a grave suspicion due to its\r\nmisuse, and is now held to be base flattery rather than trustworthy\r\ntestimony to heroic deeds. Is it not obvious that I must put my faith in\r\nthe merit of him whom I undertake to praise, and with full confidence\r\ndevote my energies to this panegyric? What then shall be the prelude of my\r\nspeech and the most suitable arrangement? Assuredly I must begin with the\r\nvirtues of your ancestors through which it was possible for you to come to\r\nbe what you are. Next I think it will be proper to describe your\r\nupbringing and education, since these contributed very much to the noble\r\nqualities that you possess, and when I have dealt with all these, I must\r\nrecount your achievements, the signs and tokens, as it were, of the\r\nnobility of your soul, and finally, as the crown and consummation of my\r\ndiscourse, I shall set forth those personal qualities from which was\r\nevolved all that was noble in your projects and their execution. It is in\r\nthis respect that I think my speech will surpass those of all the others.\r\nFor some limit themselves to your exploits, with the idea that a\r\ndescription of these suffices for a perfect panegyric, but for my part I\r\nthink one ought to devote the greater part of one’s speech to the virtues\r\nthat were the stepping‐stones by which you reached the height of your\r\nachievements. Military exploits in most cases, nay in almost all, are\r\nachieved with the help of fortune, the body‐guard, heavy infantry and\r\ncavalry regiments. But virtuous actions belong to the doer alone, and the\r\npraise that they inspire, if it be sincere, belongs only to the possessor\r\nof such virtue. Now, having made this distinction clear, I will begin my\r\nspeech.)\r\n\r\nὉ μὲν οὖν τῶν ἐπαίνων νόμος οὐδὲν ἔλαττον τῆς πατρίδος ἢ τῶν προγόνων\r\nἀξιοῖ μεμνῆσθαι. ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ οἶδα, τίνα χρὴ πρῶτον ὑπολαβεῖν πατρίδα σήν·\r\nἔθνη γὰρ μυρία περὶ ταύτης ἀμφισβητεῖ πολὺν ἤδη χρόνον.

But I am at a loss what country I ought to\r\nconsider peculiarly yours. For countless nations have long asserted their\r\nclaim to be your country. The city(23) that rules over them all was your\r\nmother and nurse, and in an auspicious hour delivered to you the imperial\r\nsceptre, and therefore asserts her sole title to the honour, and that not\r\nmerely by resorting to the plea that has prevailed under all the emperors.\r\nI mean that, even if men are born elsewhere, they all adopt her\r\nconstitution and use the laws and customs that she has promulgated, and by\r\nthat fact become Roman citizens. But her claim is different, namely that\r\nshe gave your mother birth, rearing her royally and as befitted the\r\noffspring who were to be born to her. Then again, the city on the Bosporus\r\nwhich is named after the family of the Constantii, though she does not\r\nassert that she is your native place, but acknowledges that she became\r\nyour adopted land by your father’s act, will think she is cheated of her\r\nrights if any orator should try to deprive her of at least this claim to\r\nkinship. Thirdly, the Illyrians, on whose soil you were born, will not\r\ntolerate it if anyone assign you a different fatherland and rob them of\r\nthe fairest gift of fortune. And now I hear some even of the Eastern\r\nprovinces protest that it is unjust of me to rob them of the lustre they\r\nderive from you. For they say that they sent forth your grandmother to be\r\nthe consort of your grandfather on the mother’s side. Almost all the rest\r\nhave hit on some pretension of more or less weight, and are determined, on\r\none ground or another, to adopt you for their own. Therefore let that\r\ncountry(24) have the prize which you yourself prefer and have so often\r\npraised as the mother and teacher of the virtues; as for the rest, let\r\neach one according to her deserts obtain her due. I should be glad to\r\npraise them all, worthy as they are of glory and honour, but I am afraid\r\nthat my compliments, however germane they may seem to my subject, might,\r\non account of their length, be thought inappropriate to the present\r\noccasion. For this reason, then, I think it better to omit a eulogy of the\r\nothers, but as for Rome, your imperial Majesty summed up her praises in\r\ntwo words when you called her the teacher of virtue, and, by bestowing on\r\nher the fairest of all encomiums, you have forestalled all that others\r\nmight say. What praise of mine would come up to that? What indeed is left\r\nfor anyone to say? So I feel that I, who naturally hold that city in\r\nreverence, shall pay her a higher honour if I leave her praise in your\r\nhands.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐγενείας τῆς σῆς ἴσως ἄξιον ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος ἐν βραχεῖ\r\nδιελθεῖν. ἀπορεῖν δὲ ἔοικα κάνταῦθα, [D] πόθεν ἄρχεσθαι χρή. πρόγονοί τε\r\nγάρ εἰσί σοι καὶ πάπποι καὶ γονεῖς ἀδελφοί τε καῖ ἀνεψιοὶ καὶ ξυγγενεῖς\r\nβασιλεῖς ἅπαντες, αὐτοὶ κτησάμενοι τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐννόμως ἢ παρὰ τῶν κρατούντων\r\nεἰσποιηθέντες. καὶ τὰ μὲν παλαιὰ τί δεῖ λέγειν, Κλαυδίου μνησθέντα, καὶ\r\nτῆς ἀρετῆς τῆς ἐκείνου ἐναργῆ παρέχειν καὶ γνώριμα πᾶσι τεκμήρια, τῶν\r\nἀγώνων τῶν(25) πρὸς τοὺς ὑπὲρ τὸν Ἴστρον οἰκοῦντας βαρβάρους\r\nἀναμιμνήσκοντα, καὶ ὅπως τὴν ἀρχὴν ὁσίως ἅμα καὶ δικαίως ἑκτήσατο, [7] καὶ\r\nτὴν ἐν βασιλείᾳ τῆς διαίτης λιτότητα, καὶ τὴν ἀφέλειαν τῆς ἐσθῆτος ἐπὶ τῶν\r\nεἰκόνων ὁρωμένην ἔτι; τὰ δὲ ὑπὲρ τῶν πάππων τῶν σῶν ἐστι μὲν τούτων\r\nνεώτερα, λαμπρὰ δὲ οὐ μεῖον ἐκείνων. ἔτυχον μὲν γὰρ ἄμφω τῆς ἀρχῆς δι᾽\r\nἀρετὴν ἀξίω κριθέντε, γενομένω δὲ ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων οὕτω πρός τε ἀλλήλους\r\nεὐνοïκῶς ἔσχον καὶ πρὸς τὸν μεταδόντα τῆς βασιλείας εὐσεβῶς, ὥσθ᾽ ὁ μὲν\r\nὡμολόγει μηδὲν τούτου πώποτε κρεῖττον βεβουλεῦσθαι, [B] πολλὰ καὶ ἄλλα\r\nσωτήρια τοῖς κοινοῖς ἐξευρών, οἱ δὲ τὴν μετ᾽ ἀλλήλων κοινωνίαν μᾶλλον ἢ\r\nτὴν τῶν ὅλων ἀρχήν, εἴπερ οἷόν τε ἦν, ἑκάστῳ περιγενομένην ἠγάπων. οὕτω δὲ\r\nδιακείμενοι τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν ἔργων ἔδρων τὰ κάλλιστα, σεβόμενοι μὲν μετὰ τὴν\r\nκρείττονα φύσιν τὸν τὴν ἀρχὴν αὐτοῖς παρασχόντα, τοῖς ὑπηκόοις δὲ\r\nπρᾴως(26) καὶ φιλανθρώπως χρώμενοι, καὶ τοὺς [C] βαρβάρους οὐκ ἐλαύνοντες\r\nμόνον πάλαι κατοικοῦντας καὶ νεμομένους καθάπερ τὴν οἰκείαν ἀδεῶς τὰ\r\nἡμέτερα, φρούρια δὲ ἐπιτειχίζοντες αὐτοῖς τοσαύτην πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰρήνην\r\nτοῖς ὑπηκόοις κατέστησαν, ὅσην οὐδὲ εὔξασθαι τότε ῥᾴδιον ἐδόκει. ἀλλ᾽ ὑπὲρ\r\nμὲν τούτων οὐκ ἄξιον ἐν παρέργῳ λέγειν. τῆς δὲ ὁμονοίας αὐτῶν τῆς πρὸς\r\nἀλλήλους τὸ μέγιστον σημεῖον παραλιπεῖν οὐδαμῶς εὔλογον, καὶ ἄλλως\r\nπροσῆκον τῷ λόγῳ.

Only that here too I am at a loss where to begin. For all your\r\nancestors, grandfathers, parents, brothers, cousins and kinsfolk were\r\nemperors, who had either acquired their power by lawful means or were\r\nadopted by the reigning house. Why should I recall ancient history or hark\r\nback to Claudius and produce proofs of his merit, which are manifest and\r\nknown to all? To what end recount his campaigns against the barbarians\r\nacross the Danube or how righteously and justly he won the empire? How\r\nplainly he lived while on the throne! How simple was his dress, as may be\r\nseen to this day in his statues! What I might say about your\r\ngrandparents(27) is comparatively recent, but equally remarkable. Both of\r\nthem acquired the imperial sceptre as the reward of conspicuous merit, and\r\nhaving assumed the command, they were on such good terms with each other\r\nand displayed such filial piety to him(28) who had granted them a share in\r\nthe empire, that he used to say that of all the safeguards designed by him\r\nfor the realm, and they were many, this was his master‐stroke. They,\r\nmeanwhile, valued their mutual understanding more than undivided empire,\r\nsupposing that it could have been bestowed on either of them separately.\r\nThis was the temper of their souls, and nobly they played their part in\r\naction, while next to the Supreme Being they reverenced him who had placed\r\nauthority in their hands. With their subjects they dealt righteously and\r\nhumanely, and expelled the barbarians who had for years settled in our\r\nterritory and had occupied it with impunity as though it were their own,\r\nand they built forts to hinder encroachment, which procured for those\r\nsubjects such peaceful relations with the barbarians as, at that period,\r\nseemed to be beyond their dreams. This, however, is a subject that\r\ndeserves more than a passing mention. Yet it would be wrong to omit the\r\nstrongest proof of their unanimity, especially as it is related to my\r\nsubject. Since they desired the most perfect harmony for their children,\r\nthey arranged the marriage of your father and mother.(29) On this point\r\nalso I think I must say a few words to show that virtue was bequeathed to\r\nyou as well as a throne. But why waste time in telling how your father, on\r\nhis father’s death, became emperor both by the choice of the deceased\r\nmonarch and by the vote of all the armies? His military genius was made\r\nevident by his achievements and needs no words of mine. He traversed the\r\nwhole civilised world suppressing tyrants, but never those who ruled by\r\nright. His subjects he inspired with such affection that his veterans\r\nstill remember how generous he was with largess and other rewards, and to\r\nthis day worship him as though he were a god. As for the mass of the\r\npeople, in town and country alike, they prayed that your father might be\r\nvictorious over the tyrants, not so much because they would be delivered\r\nfrom that oppression as because they would then be governed by him. But\r\nwhen he had made his power supreme, he found that the tyrant’s(30) greed\r\nhad worked like a drought, with the result that money was very scarce,\r\nwhile there were great hoards of treasure in the recesses of the palace;\r\nso he unlocked its doors and on the instant flooded the whole country with\r\nwealth, and then, in less than ten years, he founded and gave his name to\r\na city(31) that as far surpasses all others as it is itself inferior to\r\nRome; and to come second to Rome seems to me a much greater honour than to\r\nbe counted first and foremost of all cities beside. Here it may be proper\r\nto mention Athens “the illustrious,”(32) seeing that during his whole life\r\nhe honoured her in word and deed. He who was emperor and lord of all did\r\nnot disdain the title of General of the Athenians, and when they gave him\r\na statue with an inscription to that effect he felt more pride than if he\r\nhad been awarded the highest honours. To repay Athens for this compliment\r\nhe bestowed on her annually a gift of many tens of thousands of bushels of\r\nwheat, so that while she enjoyed plenty, he won applause and reverence\r\nfrom the best of men.)\r\n\r\nΠολλῶν δὲ καὲ καλῶν ἔργων τῷ πατρὶ τῷ σῷ πραχθέντων, ὧν τε ἐπεμνήσθην καὶ\r\nὅσα διὰ τὸ μῆκος παραλιπεῖν δοκῶ, πάντων ἄριστον ἔγογε φαίην ἄν, [9] οἶμαι\r\nδὲ καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἅπαντας ὁμολογήσειν, τὴν σὴν γένεσιν καὶ τροφὴν καὶ\r\nπαιδείαν· ἐξ ἧς ὑπάρχει τοῖς λοιποῖς οὐ τὸ πρὸς ὀλίγον ἀπολαῦσαι τῆς\r\nἀρίστης ἀρχῆς, ἀλλ᾽ ὡς οἷον τέ ἐστιν εἰς πλείονα χρόνον. δοκεῖ γοῦν ἄρχειν\r\nἐκεῖνος εἰσέτι. καὶ Κύρῳ μὲν οὐχ ὑπῆρχε τοῦτο. τελευτήσαντος γὰρ ὁ παῖς\r\nὤφθη μακρῷ φαυλότερος, ὥστε ὁ μὲν ἐκαλεῖτο πατήρ, ὁ δὲ ἐπωνομάσθη\r\nδεσπότης.

Some I have just\r\nmentioned, and others I must omit for the sake of brevity. But the most\r\nnotable of all, as I make bold to say and I think all will agree, was that\r\nhe begat, reared and educated you. This secured to the rest of the world\r\nthe advantages of good government, and that not for a limited time but for\r\na period beyond his own lifetime, as far as this is possible. At any rate\r\nyour father seems still to be on the throne. This is more than Cyrus\r\nhimself could achieve. When he died his son proved far inferior, so that\r\nwhile men called Cyrus “father,” his successor was called “master.”(34)\r\nBut you are even less stern than your father, and surpass him in many\r\nrespects, as I well know and will demonstrate in my speech as occasion\r\nshall arise. Yet, in my opinion, he should have the credit of this as\r\nwell, since it was he who gave you that admirable training concerning\r\nwhich I shall presently speak, but not till I have described your mother\r\nand brothers.(35))\r\n\r\nΤῇ μὲν γὰρ εὐγενείας τοσοῦτον περιῆν καὶ κάλλους σώματος καὶ τρόπων\r\nἀρετῆς, ὄσον οὐκ ἄλλῃ γυναικὶ ῥᾳδίως ἄν τις ἐξεύροι. ἐπεὶ καὶ Περσῶν ἀκούω\r\nτὸν ὑπὲρ Παρυσάτιδος λόγον, [C] ὅτι μόνη γέγονεν ἀδελφὴ καὶ μήτηρ καὶ\r\nγαμετὴ καὶ παῖς βασιλέως. ἀλλ᾽ ἦν γε αὕτη τοῦ γήμαντος ἀδελφὴ τῇ φύσει,\r\nνόμος δὲ ἐδίδου γαμεῖν ἀδελφὴν τῷ Πέρσῃ. τὴν σὴν δὲ μητέρα κατὰ τοὺς παρ᾽\r\nἡμῖν νόμους ἀχράντους καὶ καθαρὰς τὰς οἰκειότητας ταύτας φυλάττουσαν\r\nσυνέβαινε(36) τοῦ μὲν εἶναι παῖδα, γαμετὴν δὲ ἑτέρου, καὶ ἀδελφὴν ἄλλου,\r\nκαὶ πολλῶν αὐτοκρατόρων, οἰχὶ δὲ ἑνὸς μητέρα.

I have heard that saying of the Persians about Parysatis,\r\nthat no other woman had been the sister, mother, wife, and daughter of\r\nkings. Parysatis, however, was own sister of her husband, since their law\r\ndoes not forbid a Persian to marry his sister. But your mother, while in\r\naccordance with our laws she kept pure and unsullied those ties of\r\nkinship, was actually the daughter of one emperor,(42) the wife of\r\nanother, the sister of a third, and the mother not of one emperor but of\r\nseveral. Of these one aided your father in his war against the tyrants;\r\nanother conquered the Getae and secured for us a lasting peace with them;\r\nthe third(43) kept our frontiers safe from the enemy’s incursions, and\r\noften led his forces against them in person, so long at least as he was\r\npermitted by those who were so soon punished for their crimes against him.\r\nThough by the number and brilliance of their achievements they have indeed\r\nearned our homage, and though all the blessings of fortune were theirs in\r\nabundance, yet in the whole tale of their felicity one could pay them no\r\ngreater compliment than merely to name their sires and grandsires. But I\r\nmust not make my account of them too long, lest I should spend time that I\r\nought to devote to your own panegyric. So in what follows I will, as\r\nindeed I ought, endeavour—or rather, since affectation is out of place,\r\nlet me say I will demonstrate—that you are far more august than your\r\nancestors.)\r\n\r\n[B] Φήμας μὲν δὴ καὶ μαντείας καὶ ὄψεις τὰς ἐν τοῖς ὕπνοις, καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα\r\nθρυλεῖν εἰώθασιν ἐπὶ τῶν οὕτω λαμπρὰ καὶ περιφανῊ πραξάντων, Κύρου καὶ τοῦ\r\nτῆς ἡμετέρας οἰκιστοῦ πόλεως καὶ Ἀλεξάνδρου τοῦ Φιλίππου, καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος\r\nτοιοῦτος γέγονεν, ἑκὼν ἀφίημι· δοκεῖ γὰρ οὐ πόρρω ταῦτα τῆς ποιητικῆς\r\nἐξουσίας εἶναι. καὶ τὰ παρὰ τὴν πρώτην ὑπάρξαντά σοι γένεσιν ὡς λαμπρὰ καὶ\r\nβασιλικὰ καὶ(44) τὸ λέγειν εὔηθες.

Indeed I feel that poetic license accounts for them\r\nall. And it is foolish even to state that at the hour of your birth all\r\nthe circumstances were brilliant and suited to a prince. And now the time\r\nhas come for me to speak of your education as a boy. You were of course\r\nbound to have the princely nurture that should train your body to be\r\nstrong, muscular, healthy, and handsome, and at the same time duly equip\r\nyour soul with courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom. But this cannot\r\nresult from that loose indulgence which naturally pampers body and soul,\r\nweakening men’s wills for facing danger and their bodies for work.\r\nTherefore your body required training by suitable gymnastics, while you\r\nadorned your mind by literary studies. But I must speak at greater length\r\nabout both branches of your education, since it laid the foundation of\r\nyour later career. In your physical training you did not pursue those\r\nexercises that fit one merely for public display. What professional\r\nathletes love to call the pink of condition you thought unsuitable for a\r\nking who must enter for contests that are not make‐believe. Such a one\r\nmust put up with very little sleep and scanty food, and that of no precise\r\nquantity or quality or served at regular hours, but such as can be had\r\nwhen the stress of work allows. And so you thought you ought to train\r\nyourself in athletics with a view to this, and that your exercises must be\r\nmilitary and of many kinds, dancing and running in heavy armour, and\r\nriding. All these you have continued from early youth to practise at the\r\nright time, and in every exercise you have attained to greater perfection\r\nthan any other hoplite. Usually a hoplite who is a good infantryman cannot\r\nride, or, if he is an expert horseman, he shirks marching on foot to\r\nbattle. But of you alone it can be said that you can put on the cavalry\r\nuniform and be a match for the best of them, and when changed into a\r\nhoplite show yourself stronger, swifter, and lighter on your feet than all\r\nthe rest. Then you practised shooting at a mark, that even your hours of\r\nleisure might not be hours of ease or be found without the exercise of\r\narms. So by work that was voluntary you trained your body to stand the\r\nexertions that you would be compelled to undertake. Your mind, meanwhile,\r\nwas trained by practice in public speaking and other studies suitable to\r\nyour years. But it was not to be wholly without the discipline of\r\nexperience, nor was it for you to listen merely to lectures on the virtues\r\nas though they were ballads or saga stories, and so wait all that time\r\nwithout actual acquaintance with brave works and undertakings. Plato, that\r\nnoble philosopher, advised(49) that boys should be furnished as it were\r\nwith wings for flight by being mounted on horseback, and should then be\r\ntaken into battle so that they may be spectators of the warfare in which\r\nthey must soon be combatants. This, I make bold to say, was in your\r\nfather’s mind when he made you governor and king of the Celtic tribes\r\nwhile you were still a youth, or rather a mere boy in point of years,\r\nthough in intelligence and endurance you could already hold your own with\r\nmen of parts. Your father wisely provided that your experience of war\r\nshould be free from risks, having arranged that the barbarians should\r\nmaintain peace with his subjects. But he instigated them to internal feuds\r\nand civil war, and so taught you strategy at the expense of their lives\r\nand fortunes. This was a safer policy than the wise Plato’s. For, by his\r\nscheme, if the invading army were composed of infantry, the boys could\r\nindeed be spectators of their fathers’ prowess, or, if need arose, could\r\neven take part. But supposing that the enemy won in a cavalry engagement,\r\nthen, on the instant, one would have to devise some means to save the\r\nboys, which would be difficult indeed. But to inure the boys to face the\r\nenemy, while the hazard belongs to others, is to take counsel that both\r\nsuffices for their need and also secures their safety.)\r\n\r\nἘν μὲν δὴ τούτοις σοι πρὸς ἀνδρείαν ὑπῆρχε μελέτη. φρονήσεως δὲ ἡ μὲν\r\nφύσις, ἣν εἴληχας, αὐταρκὴς ἡγεμών· παρῆσαν δὲ οἶμαι καὶ τῶν πολιτῶν οἱ\r\nκράτιστοι τὰ πολιτικὰ διδάσκοντες. καὶ [D] παρεῖχον ἠθῶν καὶ νόμων καὶ\r\nξένων ἐπιτηδευμάτων ἐμπειρίαν αἱ πρὸς τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τῶν τῇδε βαρβάρων\r\nἐντεύξεις. καίτοι τὸν Ὀδυσσέα συνετὸν Ὅμηρος ἐκ παντὸς ἀποφῆναι\r\nπροαιρούμενος πολύτροπον εἶναὶ φησι καὶ πολλῶν ἀνθρώπων τὸν νοῦν\r\nκαταγνῶναι καὶ ἐπελθεῖν τὰς πόλεισ,(50) ἵν᾽ ἐξ ἁπάντων ἐπιλεξάμενος ἔχοι\r\nτὰ κράτιστα καὶ πρὸς παντοδαποὺς ἀνθρώπους ὁμιλεὶν δύναιτο. ἀλλὰ τῷ μὲν\r\nὃς(51) οὐκ ἐβασίλευσε ποικίλων ἠθῶν ἐμπειρίας χρεία· [13] τὸν δὲ πρὸς\r\nτοσαύτην ἡγεμονίαν τρεφόμενον οὐκ ἐν οἰκίσκῳ που χρῆν διδάσκεσθαι οὐδὲ τὴν\r\nβασιλείαν, καθάπερ ὁ Κῦρος, παίζοντα μιμεῚσθαι οὐδὲ χρηματίζειν τοῖς\r\nἥλιξι, καθάπερ ἐκεῖνον λέγουσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἔθνεσιν ὁμιλεῖν καὶ δήμοις, καὶ\r\nστρατιωτῶν τάγμασιν ἐπιτάττειν ἁπλῶς τὸ πρακτέον· ὅλως δὲ οὐδενὸς\r\nἀπολείπεσθαι τούτων, ὧν ἐχρῆν ἄνδρα γενόμενον ἐπ᾽ ἀδείας πράττειν.\r\n\r\n(It was in this way then that you were first trained in manliness. But as\r\nregards wisdom, that nature with which you were endowed was your self‐\r\nsufficing guide. But also, I think, the wisest citizens were at your\r\ndisposal and gave you lessons in statecraft. Moreover, your intercourse\r\nwith the barbarian leaders in that region gave you an acquaintance at\r\nfirst hand with the manners, laws, and usages of foreigners. Indeed, when\r\nHomer set out to prove the consummate wisdom of Odysseus, he called him\r\n“much‐travelled,” and said that he had come to know the minds of many\r\npeoples and visited their cities, so that he might choose what was best in\r\nevery one and be able to mix with all sorts and conditions of men. Yes,\r\neven Odysseus, who never ruled an empire, needed experience of the many\r\nand divers minds of men. How much more necessary that one who was being\r\nbrought up to guide an empire like this should not fit himself for the\r\ntask in some modest dwelling apart; neither should he, like young Cyrus in\r\nhis games, play at being emperor, nor give audiences to his playmates, as\r\nthey say(52) Cyrus did. Rather he ought to mix with nations and peoples,\r\nand give orders to his troops definitely indicating what is to be done,\r\nand generally he should be found wanting in none of those things which,\r\nwhen he comes to manhood, he must perform without fear.)\r\n\r\n[B] Οὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ τὰ παρὰ τούτοις ἐδιδάχθης καλῶς, ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτέραν ἤπειρον\r\nμετιὼν τοῖς Παρθυαίων καὶ Μήδων ἔθνεσιν ἀντετάχθης μόνος. ὑποτυφομένου δὲ\r\nἤδη τοῦ πολέμου καὶ οὐκ εἰς μακρὰν μέλλοντος ἀναρριπίζεσθαι, ταχέως καὶ\r\nτούτου κατέγνως τὸν τρόπον, καὶ τὴν τῶν ὅπλων ἰσχὺν ἐμιμήσω, καὶ πρὸς τὴν\r\nὥραν τοῦ θέρους εἴθισας καρτερεῖν τὸ σῶμα. πυνθάνομαι δὲ Ἀλκιβιάδην μόνον\r\nἐξ ἁπάντων Ἑλλήνων οὕτως εὐφυῶς μεταβολὰς ἐνεγκεῖν, [C] ὡς καὶ μιμήσασθαι\r\nπρῶτον(53) μὲν τὴν τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἐγκράτειαν, ἐπειδὴ Σπαρτιάταις αὑτὸν\r\nἐδεδώκει, εἶτα Θηβαίους, καὶ Θρᾴκας ὕστερον, καὶ ἐπὶ τέλει τὴν τῶν Περσῶν\r\nτρυφήν. ἀλλ᾽ ἐκεῖνος μὲν τοῖς χωρίοις συμμεταβάλλων καὶ τὸν τρόπον\r\nἀνεπίμπλατο πολλῆς δυσχερείας καὶ τὸ πάτριον ἐκινδύνευε παντελῶς\r\nἀποβαλεῖν, σὺ δὲ τῆς μὲν ἐγκρατοῦς διαίτης ᾤου δεῖν ἔχεσθαι πανταχοῦ, [D]\r\nἐθίζων δὲ τὸ σῶμα τοῖς πόνοις πρὸς τὰς μεταβολὰς ῥᾷον ἤνεγκας(54) τὴν ἐκ\r\nΓαλατῶν εἰς Παρθυαίους ἄνοδον ἢ(55) τῶν πλουσίων οἱ ταῖς ὥραις τὴν οἴκησιν\r\nσυμμεταβάλλοντες, εἰ παρὰ τὸν καιρὸν βιασθεῖεν. καί μοι δοκεῖ θεὸς εὐμενὴς\r\nπρὸς τὴν τῶν ὅλων ἡγεμονίαν ἐξ ἀρχῆς τὴν σὴν ἀρετὴν παρασκευάζειν ἐθέλων,\r\nκύκλῳ σε περιαγαγεῖν καὶ ἐπιδεῖξαι τῆς ἀρχῆς ἁπάσης ὅρους καὶ πέρατα καὶ\r\nφύσιν χωρίων [14] καὶ μέγεθος χώρας καὶ δύναμιν ἐθνῶν καὶ πλῆθος πόλεων\r\nκαὶ φύσιν δήμων καὶ τὶ κράτιστον αὐτῶν ἐκείνων τὴν περιουσίαν(56) ὧν\r\nοὐδενὸς ἀπολελεῖφθαι χρὴ τὸν πρὸς τοσαύτην ἀρχὴν τρεφόμενον. τὸ μέγιστον\r\nδὲ μικροῦ με διέφυγεν εἰπεῖν, ὅτι τούτων ἁπάντων ἄρχειν ἐκ παίδων\r\nδιδασκόμενος, ἄρχεσθαι κρεῖττον ἔμαθες, ἀρχῇ τῇ πασῶν ἀρίστῃ καὶ\r\nδικαιοτάτῃ, φύσει τε καὶ νόμῳ, σαυτὸν ὑποτιθείς· πατρὶ γὰρ ὑπήκουες ἅμα\r\nκαὶ βασιλεῖ· ὧν εἰ καὶ θάτερον ὑπῆρχεν ἐκείνῳ μόνον, ἄρχειν αὐτῷ πάντως\r\nπροσῆκον ἦν.

There were already signs that a war was smouldering\r\nand would soon burst into flame. You therefore quickly learned how to deal\r\nwith it, and, as though you took as model the hardness of your weapons,\r\nsteeled yourself to bear the heat of the summer season. I have heard say\r\nthat Alcibiades alone, among all the Greeks, was naturally so versatile\r\nthat when he cast in his lot with the Spartans he copied the self‐\r\nrestraint of the Lacedaemonians, then in turn Theban and Thracian manners,\r\nand finally adopted Persian luxury. But Alcibiades, when he changed his\r\ncountry changed his character(62) too, and became so tainted with\r\nperversity and so ill‐conditioned that he was likely to lose utterly all\r\nthat he was born to. You, however, thought it your duty to maintain your\r\nseverity of life wherever you might be, and by hard work inuring your\r\nconstitution to change, you easily bore the march inland from Galatia to\r\nParthia, more easily in fact than a rich man who lives now here, now\r\nthere, according to the season, would bear it if he were forced to\r\nencounter unseasonable weather. I think Heaven smiled on you and willed\r\nthat you should govern the whole world, and so from the first trained you\r\nin virtue, and was your guide when you journeyed to all points, and showed\r\nyou the bounds and limits of the whole empire, the character of each\r\nregion, the vastness of your territory, the power of every race, the\r\nnumber of the cities, the characteristics of the masses, and above all the\r\nvast number of things that one who is bred to so great a kingship cannot\r\nafford to neglect. But I nearly forgot to mention the most important thing\r\nof all. From a boy you were taught to govern this great empire, but a\r\nbetter thing you learned, to be governed, submitting yourself to the\r\nauthority that is the best in the world and the most just, that is to say\r\nnature and law. I mean that both as son and subject you obeyed your\r\nfather. Indeed, had he been only your father or only your king, obedience\r\nwas his due. Now what rearing and education for a king could one find in\r\nhistory better than this? Consider the Greeks. Not thus did the Spartans\r\ntrain the Heracleidae, though they are thought to have enjoyed the best\r\nform of government, that of their kings. As for the barbarians, not even\r\nthe Carthaginians, though they were particularly well‐governed by their\r\nkings, chose the best method of training their future rulers. The moral\r\ndiscipline and the studies prescribed by their laws were pursued by all\r\nalike, as though the citizens were brothers, all destined both to govern\r\nand be governed, and in the matter of education they made no difference\r\nbetween their princes and the rest of the citizens. Yet surely it is\r\nfoolish to demand superlative excellence from one’s rulers when one takes\r\nno pains to make them better than other men. Among the barbarians, indeed,\r\nno man is debarred from winning the throne, so one can excuse them for\r\ngiving the same moral training to all. But that Lycurgus, who tried to\r\nmake the dynasty of the Heracleidae proof against all shocks,(63) should\r\nnot have arranged for them a special education better than that of other\r\nSpartan youths is an omission for which he may well be criticised. He may\r\nhave thought that all the Lacedaemonians ought to enter the race for\r\nvirtue, and foster it, but for all that it was wrong to provide the same\r\nnurture and education for private citizens as for those who were to\r\ngovern. The inevitable familiarity little by little steals into men’s\r\nsouls and breeds contempt for their betters. Though, for that matter, they\r\nare not in any sense one’s betters unless it was their own merit that\r\nearned them the right to rule. This, in my opinion, is the reason why the\r\nSpartan kings often found their subjects hard to govern. In proof of what\r\nI say one might quote the rivalry of Lysander and Agesilaus, and many\r\nother instances, if one should review the history of the Spartan kings.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ τοῖς μὲν ἡ πολιτεία τὰ(64) πρὸς ἀρετὴν ἀρκούντως παρασκευάζουσα, εἰ\r\nκαὶ μηδὲν διαφέρον ἐπιτηδεύειν ἐδίδου τῶν πολλῶν, ἀλλὰ τὸ καλοῖς κἀγαθοῖς\r\nὑπάρχειν παρεῖχεν ἀνδράσι· Καρχηδονίων δὲ οὐδὲ τὰ κοινὰ τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων\r\nἐπαινεῖν ἄξιον. ἐξελαύνοντες γὰρ τῶν οἰκιῶν οἱ γονεῖς τοὺς παῖδας\r\nἐπέταττον εὐπορεῖν διὰ τῶν πόνων τῶν πρὸς τὴν χρείαν ἀναγκαίων, [C] τὸ\r\nδρᾶν τι τῶν δοκούντων αἰσχρῶν ἀπαγορεύοντες. τὸ δὲ ἦν, οὐ τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν\r\nἐξελεῖν τῶν νέων, ἀλλὰ λαθεῖν(65) πειρᾶσθαι τι δρῶντα(66) προστάττειν.\r\nπέφυκε γὰρ οὐ τρυφὴ μόνον ἦθος διαφθείρειν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡ τῶν ἀναγκαίων\r\nἐνδεὴς δίαιτα, ἐφ᾽ ὧν οὔπω τὸ κρίνειν ὁ λόγος προσλαβὼν ἕπεται ταῖς\r\nχρείαις ὑπὸ τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ἀναπειθόμενος, [D] ἄλλως τε εἰ καὶ τούτου μὴ\r\nκρατοίη τοῦ πάθους, πρὸς χρηματισμὸν ἐκ παίδων συνεθιζόμενος καί τινας\r\nἀμοιβὰς ἐμποριῶν καὶ καπηλείας τὰς μὲν αὐτὸς εὑρὼν τὰς δὲ παρὰ τῶν εἰδότων\r\nμαθών, ὑπὲρ ὧν οὐ λέγειν μόνον, ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ ἀκούειν ἄξιον ἐλευθέρῳ παιδί,\r\nπλείστας ἂν κηλῚδας ἐναπόθοιτο τῇ ψυχῇ, ὧν πασῶν καθαρὸν εἶναι χρὴ καὶ τὸν\r\nἐπιεικῆ πολίτην, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ τὸν βασιλέα καὶ στρατηγὸν μόνον.\r\n\r\n(The Spartan polity, however, by securing a satisfactory development of\r\nthe moral qualities in their kings, even if it gave them a training in no\r\nway different from that of the crowd, at least endowed them with the\r\nattributes of well‐bred men. But as for the Carthaginians, there was\r\nnothing to admire even in the discipline that they all shared. The parents\r\nturned their sons out of doors and bade them win the necessaries of life\r\nby their own efforts, with the injunction to do nothing that is considered\r\ndisgraceful. The effect of this was not to uproot the evil inclinations of\r\nthe young, but to require them to take pains not to be caught in wrong‐\r\ndoing. For it is not self‐indulgence only that ruins character, but the\r\nlack of mere necessaries may produce the same result. This is true at any\r\nrate in the case of those whose reason has not yet assumed the power to\r\ndecide, being swayed by physical needs and persuaded by desire. It is\r\nespecially true when one fails to control the passion for money‐getting,\r\nif from boyhood one is accustomed to it and to the trading and bartering\r\nof the market‐places. This business, unfit for a youth of gentle birth to\r\nmention, or so much as hear spoken of, whether the youth finds it out for\r\nhimself or learns it from those of greater experience, leaves many scars\r\non the soul; and even a respectable citizen ought to be free from all\r\nthis, not a king or general alone.)\r\n\r\nἐμοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἐπιτιμᾶν ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος ἐκείνοις προσήκει· [16] δείξω δὲ\r\nμόνον τῆς τροφῆς(67) τὸ διαφέρον, ᾗ χρησάμενος κάλλει καὶ ῥώμῃ καὶ\r\nδικαιοσύνῃ καὶ σωφροσύνῃ διήνενκας, διὰ μὲν τῶν πόνων τὴν εὐεξίαν\r\nπεριβαλόμενος, δὰα δὲ τῶν νόμων τὴν σωφροσύνην κατακτησόμενος,(68) καὶ τῷ\r\nμὲν σώματι ῥωμαλεωτέρῳ διὰ τὴν ἐγκράτειαν τῆς ψυχῆς, τῇ ψυχῇ δ᾽ αὖ διὰ τὴν\r\nτοῦ σώματος καρτερίαν δικαιοτέρᾳ χρώμενος, τὰ μὲν ἐκ φύσεως ἀγαθὰ συναύξων\r\nἐκ παντός, τὰ δὲ ταῖς ἐπιμελείαις ἔξωθεν ἀεὶ προσλαμβάνων· [B] καὶ\r\nδεόμενος(69) μὲν οὐδενός, ἐπαρκῶν δ᾽ ἄλλοις καὶ χαριζόμενος μεγάλας δωρεὰς\r\nκαὶ ὅσαι τοὺς λαβόντας ἤρκουν ἀποφῆναι τῷ Λυδῶν δυνάστῃ παραπλησίους,\r\nἐνδεέστερον μὲν ἀπολαύων αὐτὸς τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ἀγαθῶν ἢ Σπαρτιατῶν ὁ\r\nσωφρονέστατος, τοῦ τρυφᾶν δὲ παρέχων ἄλλοις χορηγίαν, καὶ τοῖς βουλομένοις\r\nσωφρονεῖν παρέχων σαυτὸν μιμεῖσθαι, ἄρχων μὲν πρᾴως καὶ φιλανθρώπως τῶν\r\nἄλλων, [C] ἀρχόμενος δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς σωφρόνως καὶ ὡς εἷς τῶν πολλῶν τόν\r\nἅπαντα διετέλεις χρόνον. παιδὶ μὲν ὄντι σοι καὶ μειρακίῳ ταῦτά τε ὑπῆρχε\r\nκαὶ ἄλλα πλείονα, περὶ ὧν νῦν λέγειν μακρότερον ἂν εἴη τοῦ καιροῦ.\r\n\r\n(But it is not for me to criticise the Carthaginians in this place. I will\r\nonly point out how different was your education, and how you profited by\r\nit and have come to excel in looks, strength, justice, and temperance. By\r\nyour active life you achieved perfect health; your temperance was the\r\nresult of obedience to the laws; you enjoy a body of unusual strength by\r\nreason of your self‐control, and a soul of unusual rectitude because of\r\nyour physical powers of endurance. You left nothing undone to improve your\r\nnatural talents, but ever acquired new talents by new studies. You needed\r\nnothing yourself but gave assistance to others, and lavished such generous\r\ngifts that the recipients seemed as rich as the monarch of the\r\nLydians.(70) Though you indulged yourself less in the good things that\r\nwere yours than the most austere of the Spartans, you gave others the\r\nmeans of luxury in abundance, while those who preferred temperance could\r\nimitate your example. As a ruler you were mild and humane; as your\r\nfather’s subject you were ever as modest as any one of his people. All\r\nthis was true of you in boyhood and youth, and much more about which there\r\nis now no time to speak at length.)\r\n\r\nΓενόμενος δὲ ἐφ᾽ ἡλικίας, καὶ τῷ πατρὶ τὴν εἱμαρμένην τελευτὴν τοῦ\r\nδαίμονος μάλα ὀλβίαν παρασχόντος, οὐ μόνον τῷ πλήθει καὶ κάλλει τῶν\r\nἐπενεχθέντων τὸν τάφον ἐκόσμεις, γενέσεως καὶ τροφῆς ἀποτίνων τὰ\r\nχαριστήρια, [D] πολὺ δὲ πλέον τῷ μόνος ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐκείνου παίδων ζῶντος\r\nμὲν ἔτι καὶ πιεζομένου τῇ νόσῳ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁρμῆσαι, τελευτήσαντος δὲ τὰς\r\nμεγίστας τιμὰς καταστῆσαι, ὑπὲρ ὧν ἐξαρκεῖ καὶ τὸ μνησθῆναι. καλοῦσι γὰρ\r\nἡμᾶς ἐφ᾽ αὑτὰς αἱ πράξεις ὑπομιμνήσκουσαι τῆς ῥώμης, τῆς εὐψυχίας,\r\nεὐβουλίας τε ἅμα καὶ δικαιότητος, οἷς ἄμαχος ὤφθης καὶ ἀνυπέρβλητος, τὰ\r\nμὲν πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς καὶ τοὺς πολίτας καὶ [17] τοὺς πατρῴους σοι φίλους\r\nκαὶ τὰ στρατεύματα δικαίως καὶ σωφρόνως καταστησάμενος· πλὴν εἴ που\r\nβιασθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν καιρῶν ἄκων ἑτέρους ἐξαμαρτεῖν οὐ διεκώλυσας· τὰ δὲ πρὸς\r\nτοὺς πολεμίους ἀνδρείως καὶ μεγαλοπρεπῶς καὶ τῆς προüπαρχούσης ἀξίως τοῪ\r\nγένους δόξης καταστρησάμενος. τοῖς μὲν δι᾽ ὁμονοίας τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον\r\nσυγγέγονας, ἀστασίαστον μὲν τὴν πόλιν [B] διαφυλάττων καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς\r\nσυνάρχοντας θεραπεύων ἀεί, τοῖς φίλοις δὲ τῆς ἰσηγορίας(71) μεταδιδοὺς καὶ\r\nτῆς παρρησίας μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων ἀγαθῶν ἀφθόνως, κοινωνῶν μὲν ἅπασι τῶν\r\nὑπαρχόντων, μεταδιδοὺς δὲ ὧν ἕκαστος ἐνδεὴς δόξειε. καὶ τούτων μάρτυσι μὲν\r\nαὐτοῖς ἐκείνοις εἰκότως ἄν τις χρήσαιτο, καὶ τὰ πράγματα δὲ τοῖς\r\nἀπολειφθεῖσι τῆς πρὸς ἐκείνους συνουσίας ἱκανὰ δηλῶσαι τὴν προαίρεσιν τοῦ\r\nβίου παντός.\r\n\r\n(When you had come to man’s estate, and after fate had decreed the ending\r\nof your father’s life(72) and Heaven had granted that his last hours\r\nshould be peculiarly blest, you adorned his tomb not only by lavishing on\r\nit splendid decorations(73) and so paying the debt of gratitude for your\r\nbirth and education, but still more by the fact that you alone of his sons\r\nhastened to him when he was still alive and stricken by illness, and paid\r\nhim the highest possible honours after his death. But all this I need only\r\nmention in passing. For now it is your exploits that cry aloud for notice\r\nand remind me of your energy, courage, good judgment, and justice. In\r\nthese qualities you are unsurpassed, unrivalled. In your dealings with\r\nyour brothers,(74) your subjects, your father’s friends, and your armies\r\nyou displayed justice and moderation; except that, in some cases, forced\r\nas you were by the critical state of affairs, you could not, in spite of\r\nyour own wishes, prevent others from going astray. Towards the enemy your\r\ndemeanour was brave, generous, and worthy of the previous reputation of\r\nyour house. While you maintained the friendly relations that already\r\nexisted, kept the capital free from civil discord, and continued to\r\ncherish your brothers who were your partners in empire, you granted to\r\nyour friends, among other benefits, the privilege of addressing you as an\r\nequal and full freedom of speech without stint, and perfect frankness. Not\r\nonly did you share with them all whatever you possessed, but you gave to\r\neach what he seemed most to need. Anyone who wants testimony to all this\r\nmight reasonably call your friends to witness, but if he does not know\r\nyour friends, the facts themselves are sufficient to demonstrate the\r\npolicy of your whole life.)\r\n\r\n[C] Ῥητέον δὲ ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ἤδη τῶν πράξεων ἀναβαλλομένοις τὸν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἕξεων\r\nλόγον.

The Persians in the past conquered the\r\nwhole of Asia, subjugated a great part of Europe, and had embraced in\r\ntheir hopes I may almost say the whole inhabited world, when the\r\nMacedonians deprived them of their supremacy, and they provided\r\nAlexander’s generalship with a task, or rather with a toy. But they could\r\nnot endure the yoke of slavery, and no sooner was Alexander dead, than\r\nthey revolted from his successors and once more opposed their power to the\r\nMacedonians, and so successfully that, when we took over what was left of\r\nthe Macedonian empire, we counted them to the end as foes with whom we\r\nmust reckon. I need not now remind you of ancient history, of Antony and\r\nCrassus,(80) who were generals with the fullest powers, or tell how after\r\nlong‐continued dangers we succeeded in wiping out the disgrace they\r\nincurred, and how many a prudent general retrieved their blunders. Nor\r\nneed I recall the second chapter of our misfortunes and the exploits of\r\nCarus(81) that followed, when after those failures he was appointed\r\ngeneral. Among those who sat on the throne before your father’s time and\r\nimposed on the Persians conditions of peace admired and welcomed by all,\r\ndid not the Caesar(82) incur a disgraceful defeat when he attacked them on\r\nhis own account? It was not till the ruler of the whole world(83) turned\r\nhis attention to them, directing thither all the forces of the empire,\r\noccupying all the passes with his troops and levies of hoplites, both\r\nveterans and new recruits, and employing every sort of military\r\nequipments, that fear drove them to accept terms of peace. That peace they\r\nsomehow contrived to disturb and break during your father’s lifetime, but\r\nthey escaped punishment at his hands because he died in the midst of\r\npreparations for a campaign. It was left for you later on to punish them\r\nfor their audacity. I shall often have to speak of your campaigns against\r\nthem, but this one thing I ask my hearers to observe. You became master of\r\na third of the empire,(84) that part in fact which seemed by no means\r\nstrong enough to carry on a war, since it had neither arms nor troops in\r\nthe field, nor any of those military resources which ought to flow in\r\nabundantly in preparation for so important a war. Then, too, your\r\nbrothers, for whatever reason, did nothing to make the war easier for you.\r\nAnd yet there is no sycophant so shameless and so envious as not to admit\r\nthat the harmony existing between you was mainly due to you. The war in\r\nitself presented peculiar difficulties, in my opinion, and the troops were\r\ndisaffected owing to the change of government; they raised the cry that\r\nthey missed their old leader and they wished to control your actions. Nay,\r\nmore; a thousand strange and perplexing circumstances arose on every hand\r\nto render your hopes regarding the war more difficult to realise. The\r\nArmenians, our ancient allies, revolted, and no small part of them went\r\nover to the Persians and overran and raided the country on their borders.\r\nIn this crisis there seemed to be but one hope of safety, that you should\r\ntake charge of affairs and plan the campaign, but at the moment this was\r\nimpossible, because you were in Paeonia(85) making treaties with your\r\nbrothers. Thither you went in person, and so managed that you gave them no\r\nopening for criticism. Indeed, I almost forgot to mention the very first\r\nof your achievements, the noblest of all, or at any rate equal to the\r\nnoblest. For there is no greater proof of your prudence and magnanimity\r\nthan the fact that, in planning for interests of such importance, you\r\nthought it no disadvantage if you should, of your own free will, concede\r\nthe lion’s share to your brothers. Imagine, for instance, a man dividing\r\namong his brothers their father’s estate of a hundred talents, or, if you\r\nprefer, twice as much. Then suppose him to have been content with fifty\r\nminae less than the others, and to raise no objection, because he secured\r\ntheir goodwill in exchange for that trifling sum. You would think he\r\ndeserved all praise and respect as one who had a soul above money, as far‐\r\nsighted, in short as a man of honour. But here is one whose policy with\r\nregard to the empire of the world seems to have been so high minded, so\r\nprudent, that, without increasing the burdens of administration, he\r\nwillingly gave up some of the imperial revenues in order to secure harmony\r\nand peace among all Roman citizens. What praise such a one deserves! And\r\ncertainly one cannot, in this connection, quote the saying, “Well done,\r\nbut a bad bargain.” Nothing, in my opinion, can be called a good bargain\r\nif it be not honourable as well. In general, if anyone wish to apply the\r\ntest of expediency alone, he ought not to make money his criterion or\r\nreckon up his revenues from estates, like those old misers whom writers of\r\ncomedy bring on to the stage, but he should take into account the vastness\r\nof the empire and the point of honour involved. If the Emperor had\r\ndisputed about the boundaries and taken a hostile attitude, he might have\r\nobtained more than he did, but he would have governed only his allotted\r\nshare. But he scorned and despised such trifles, and the result was that\r\nhe really governed the whole world in partnership with his brothers, but\r\nhad the care of his own portion only, and, while he kept his dignity\r\nunimpaired, he had less than his share of the toil and trouble that go\r\nwith such a position.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ὑπὲρ μὲν τούτων καὶ αὖθις ἐξέσται διὰ μακροτέρων δηλῶσαι. ὅπως δὲ τῶν\r\nπραγμάτων ἐπεμελήθης, [B] τοσούτων κύκλῳ περιστάντων μετὰ τὴν τοῦ πατρὸς\r\nτελευτὴν κινδύνων καὶ παντοδαπῶν πραγμάτων, θορύβου,(86) πολέμου\r\nἀναγκαίου,(87) πολλῆς καταδρομῆς συμμάχων ἀποστάσεως, στρατοπέδων ἀταξίας,\r\nὅσα ἄλλα τότε δυσχερῆ κατελάμβανεν, ἴσως ἤδη διελθεῖν ἄξιον. ἐπειδὴ γάρ\r\nσοι τὰ τῶν συνθηκῶν μετὰ τῆς ἀρίστης ὁμονοίας διῴκητο, παρῆν δὲ ὁ καιρὸς\r\nτοῖς πράγμασιν ἐπιτάττων βοηθεῖν κινδυνεύουσι, [C] πορείαις ταχείαις(88)\r\nχρησάμενος ὅπως μὲν ἐκ(89) Παιόνων ἐν Σύροις ὤφθης, οὐδὲ τῷ λόγῳ δεῖξαι\r\nῥᾴδιον· ἀρκεῖ δὲ τοῖς ἐγνωκόσιν ἡ πεῖρα. ὅπως δὲ πρὸς τὴν παρουσίαν τὴν\r\nσὴν ἀθρόως ἅπαντα μεταβαλόντα καὶ μεταστάντα πρὸς τὸ βέλτιον οὐ μόνον τῶν\r\nἐπικρεμασθέντων ἡμᾶς ἀπήλλαξε φόβων, ἀμείνους δὲ μακρῷ τὰς ὑπὲρ τῶν\r\nμελλόντων παρέσχεν ἐλπίδας, [D] τίς ἂν ἀρκέσειε τῶν ἁπάντων εἰπεῖν; τὰ μὲν\r\nτῶν στρατοπέδων, πλησίον γενομένου μόνον, ἐπέπαυτο τῆς ἀταξίας καὶ\r\nμεθειστήκει πρὸς κόσμον, Ἀρμενίων δὲ οἱ προσθέμενοι τοῖς πολεμίοις εὐθὺς\r\nμετάστησαν, σοῦ τοὺς μὲν αἰτίους τῆς φυγῆς τῷ τῆς χώρας ἐκείνης ἄρχοντι\r\nπαρ᾽ ἡμᾶς ἐξαγαγόντος, τοῖς φεύγουσι δὲ τὴν ἐς τὴν οἰκείαν κάθοδον ἀδεᾶ\r\nπαρασκευάσαντος. οὕτω δὲ φιλανθρώπως τοῖς τε παρ᾽ ἡμᾶς ἀφικομένοις ἄρτι\r\n[21] χρησαμένου καὶ τοῖς ἐκ τῆς φυγῆς μετὰ τοῦ σφῶν ἄρχοντος κατεληλυθόσι\r\nπρᾴως ὁμιλοῦντος, οἱ μέν, ὅτι καὶ πρότερον ἀπέστησαν, αὑτοὺς ἀπωλοφύραντο,\r\nοἱ δὲ τὴν παροῦσαν τύχην τῆς πρόσθεν ἠγάπων μᾶλλον δυναστείας. καὶ οἱ μὲν\r\nφεύγοντες ἔμπροσθεν ἔργῳ σωφρονεῖν ἔφασαν ἐκμαθεῖν, οἱ δὲ τοῦ μὴ\r\nμεταστῆναι τῆς ἀμοιβῆς ἀξίας τυγχάνειν. τοσαύτῃ δὲ ἐχρήσω περὶ τοὺς\r\nκατελθόντας ὑπερβολῇ δωρεῶν καὶ τιμῆς, ὥστε μηδὲ [B] τοῖς ἐχθίστοις σφῶν\r\nεὖ πράττουσι καὶ τὰ εἰκότα τιμωμένοις ἄχθεσθαι μηδὲ βασκαίνειν. ταῦτα δὲ\r\nἐν βραχεῖ καταστησάμενος καὶ τοὺς ἐξ Ἀραβίας λῃστὰς ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους\r\nταῖς πρεσβείαις τρέψας, ἐπὶ τὰς τοῦ πολέμου παρασκευὰς ἦλθες, ὑπὲρ ὧν οὐ\r\nχεῖρον ἐν βραχεῖ προειπεῖν.\r\n\r\n(On that subject, however, I shall have a chance later to speak in more\r\ndetail. This is perhaps the right moment to describe how you controlled\r\nthe situation, encompassed as you were, after your father’s death, by so\r\nmany perils and difficulties of all sorts—confusion, an unavoidable war,\r\nnumerous hostile raids, allies in revolt, lack of discipline in the\r\ngarrisons, and all the other harassing conditions of the hour. You\r\nconcluded in perfect harmony the negotiations with your brothers, and when\r\nthe time had arrived that demanded your aid for the dangerous crisis of\r\naffairs, you made forced marches, and immediately after leaving Paeonia\r\nappeared in Syria. But to relate how you did this would tax my powers of\r\ndescription, and indeed for those who know the facts their own experience\r\nis enough. But who in the world could describe adequately how, at the\r\nprospect of your arrival, everything was changed and improved all at once,\r\nso that we were set free from the fears that hung over us and could\r\nentertain brighter hopes than ever for the future? Even before you were\r\nactually on the spot the mutiny among the garrisons ceased and order was\r\nrestored. The Armenians who had gone over to the enemy at once changed\r\nsides again, for you ejected from the country and sent to Rome those who\r\nwere responsible for the governor’s(90) exile, and you secured for the\r\nexiles a safe return to their own country. You were so merciful to those\r\nwho now came to Rome as exiles, and so kind in your dealings with those\r\nwho returned from exile with the governor, that the former did, indeed,\r\nbewail their misfortune in having revolted, but still were better pleased\r\nwith their present condition than with their previous usurpation; while\r\nthe latter, who were formerly in exile, declared that the experience had\r\nbeen a lesson in prudence, but that now they were receiving a worthy\r\nreward for their loyalty. On the returned exiles you lavished such\r\nmagnificent presents and rewards that they could not even resent the good\r\nfortune of their bitterest enemies, nor begrudge their being duly\r\nhonoured. All these difficulties you quickly settled, and then by means of\r\nembassies you turned the marauding Arabs against our enemies. Then you\r\nbegan preparations for the war, about which I may as well say a few\r\nwords.)\r\n\r\nΤῆς γὰρ εἰρήνης τῆς πρόσθεν τοῖς μὲν στρατευομένοις ἀνείσης τοὺς πόνους,\r\nτοῖς λειτουργοῦσι δὲ κουφοτέρας τὰς λειτουργίας(91) παρασχούσης, τοῦ\r\nπολέμου δὲ χρημάτων καὶ σιτηρεσίου καὶ χορηγίας λαμπρᾶς δεομένου, [C] πολὺ\r\nδὲ πλέον ἰσχύος καὶ ῥώμης καὶ τῆς ἐν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἐμπειρίας τῶν\r\nστρατευομένων, ὑπάρχοντος δὲ οὐδενὸς σχεδὸν τῶν τοιούτων, αὐτὸς ἐξηῦρες\r\nκαὶ κατέστησας, τοῖς μὲν ἐν(92) ἡλικίᾳ στρατεύεσθαι λαχοῦσιν ἀποδείξας τῶν\r\nπόνων μελέτην, παπαπλησίαν δὲ τοῖς πολεμίοις ἱππικὴν καταστησάμενος\r\nδύναμιν, τῷ πεζῷ δὲ ἐπιτάξας τῶν πόνων ἔχεσθαι· καὶ ταῦτα οὐ ῥήμασι μόνον\r\nοὐδὲ ἐξ ἐπιτάγματος, μελετῶν δὲ [D] αὐτὸς καὶ συνασκούμενος καὶ δεικνύων\r\nἔργῳ τὸ πρακτέον, πολέμων ἐργάτας ἄφνω κατέστησας. χρημάτων δὲ ἐπενόεις\r\nπόρους, οὐκ αὔξων τοὺς φόρους οὐδὲ τὰς συντάξεις, καθάπερ Ἀθηναῖοι\r\nπρόσθεν, εἰς τὸ διπλάσιον ἢ καὶ ἐπὶ πλέον καταστήσας, ἐμμένων δὲ οἶμαι\r\nτοῖς ἀρχαίοις πλὴν εἴ που πρὸς βραχὺ καὶ πρὸς καιρὸν(93) ἐχρῆν αἰσθέσθαι\r\nδαπανηροτέρων τῶν λειτουργημάτων. ἐν τοσαύτηι δὲ(94) τοὺς στρατευομένους\r\nἦγες ἀφθονίᾳ, [22] ὡς μὴτε ὑβρίζειν τῷ κόρῳ μήτε ὑπὸ τῆς ἐνδείας\r\nπλημμελεῖν ἀναγκασθῆναι. ὅπλων δὲ καὶ ἵππων παρασκευὴν καὶ νεῶν τῶν\r\nποταμίων καὶ μηχανημάτων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἁπάντων τὸ πλῆθος σιωπῇ κατέχω.\r\nἐπεὶ δὲ τὰ τῆς παρασκευῆς τέλος εἶχε καὶ ἔδει χρῆσθαι τοῖς προρρηθεῖσιν\r\nεἰς δέον, ἐζεύγνυτο μὲν ὁ Τίγρης σχεδίᾳ πολλάκις, ἤρθη δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ\r\nφρούρια, καὶ τῶν πολεμίων οὐδεὶς ἐτόλμησεν ἀμῦναι τῇ χώρᾳ πορθουμένῃ, [B]\r\nπάντα δὲ παρ᾽ ἡμᾶς ἤγετο τἀκείνων ἀγαθά, τῶν μὲν οὐδὲ εἰς χεῖρας ἰέναι\r\nτολμώντων, τῶν θρασυνομένων δὲ παρ᾽ αὐτὰ τὴν τιμωρίαν ὑποσχόντων. τὸ μὲν\r\nδὴ κεφάλαιον τῶν εἰς τὴν πολεμίαν εἰσβολῶν τοιοῦτον. καθ᾽ ἕκαστον γὰρ\r\nἐπεξιέναι τίς ἂν ἀξίως ἐν βραχεῖ λόγῳ δυνηθείη, τῶν μὲν τὰς συμφορὰς τῶν\r\nδὲ τὰς ἀριστείας ἀπαριθμούμενος; τοσοῦτον δὲ ἴσως εἰπεῖν οὐ χαλεπόν, [C]\r\nὅτι πολλάκις τὸν ποταμὸν ἐκεῖνον περαιωθεὶς ξὺν τῷ στρατεύματι καὶ πολὺν\r\nἐν τῇ πολεμίᾳ διατρίψας(95) χρόνον, λαμπρὸς ἐπανῄεις τοῖς τροπαίοις, τὰς\r\nδιὰ σὲ πόλεις ἐλευθέρας ἐπιὼν καὶ χαριζόμενος εἰρήνην καὶ πλοῦτον, πάντα\r\nἀθρόως τὰ ἀγαθά, καὶ τῶν πάλαι ποθουμένων διδοὺς ἀπολαύειν, νίκης κατὰ τῶν\r\nβαρβάρων, τροπαίων ἐγειρομένων κατὰ τῆς Παρθυαίων ἀπιστίας καὶ\r\nἀνανδρίας,(96) ὧν τὸ μὲν ἐπεδείξαντο [D] τὰς σπονδὰς λύσαντες καὶ τὴν\r\nεἰρήνην συγχέαντες, τὸ δὲ μὴ τολμῶντες ὑπὲρ τῆς χώρας καὶ τῶν φιλτάτων\r\nἀμύνεσθαι.\r\n\r\n(The previous period of peace had relaxed the labours of the troops, and\r\nlightened the burdens of those who had to perform public services. But the\r\nwar called for money, provisions, and supplies on a vast scale, and even\r\nmore it demanded endurance, energy, and military experience on the part of\r\nthe troops. In the almost entire absence of all these, you personally\r\nprovided and organised everything, drilled those who had reached the age\r\nfor military service, got together a force of cavalry to match the\r\nenemy’s, and issued orders for the infantry to persevere in their\r\ntraining. Nor did you confine yourself to speeches and giving orders, but\r\nyourself trained and drilled with the troops, showed them their duty by\r\nactual example, and straightway made them experts in the art of war. Then\r\nyou discovered ways and means, not by increasing the tribute or the\r\nextraordinary contributions, as the Athenians did in their day, when they\r\nraised these to double or even more. You were content, I understand, with\r\nthe original revenues, except in cases where, for a short time, and to\r\nmeet an emergency, it was necessary that the people should find their\r\nservices to the state more expensive. The troops under your leadership\r\nwere abundantly supplied, yet not so as to cause the satiety that leads to\r\ninsolence, nor, on the other hand, were they driven to insubordination\r\nfrom lack of necessaries. I shall say nothing about your great array of\r\narms, horses, and river‐boats, engines of war and the like. But when all\r\nwas ready and the time had come to make appropriate use of all that I have\r\nmentioned, the Tigris was bridged by rafts at many points and forts were\r\nbuilt to guard the river. Meanwhile the enemy never once ventured to\r\ndefend their country from plunder, and every useful thing that they\r\npossessed was brought in to us. This was partly because they were afraid\r\nto offer battle, partly because those who were rash enough to do so were\r\npunished on the spot. This is a mere summary of your invasions of the\r\nenemy’s country. Who, indeed, in a short speech could do justice to every\r\nevent, or reckon up the enemy’s disasters and our successes? But this at\r\nleast I have space to tell. You often crossed the Tigris with your army\r\nand spent a long time in the enemy’s country, but you always returned\r\ncrowned with the laurels of victory. Then you visited the cities you had\r\nfreed, and bestowed on them peace and plenty, all possible blessings and\r\nall at once. Thus at your hands they received what they had so long\r\ndesired, the defeat of the barbarians and the erection of trophies of\r\nvictory over the treachery and cowardice of the Parthians. Treachery they\r\nhad displayed when they violated the treaties and broke the peace,\r\ncowardice when they lacked the courage to fight for their country and all\r\nthat they held dear.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ὅπως μή τις ὑπολάβῃ με τούτων μὲν ἡδέως μεμνῆσθαι τῶν ἔργων, ὀκνεῖν\r\nδὲ ἐκεῖνα, περὶ ἃ καὶ τοῖς πολεμίοις πλεονεκτῆσαι παρέσχεν ἡ τύχη, μᾶλλον\r\nδὲ ἡ χώρα τὴν ἐκ τοῦ καιροῦ προσλαβοῦσα ῥοπήν, ὡς αἰσχύνην ἡμῖν, οὐχὶ δὲ\r\nἔπαινον καὶ τιμὴν φέροντα, καὶ ὑπὲρ τούτων πειράσομαι δηλῶσαι διὰ βραχέων,\r\nοὐ πρὸς τὸ [23] λυσιτελέστατον ἐμαυτῷ τοὺς λόγους πλάττων, τὴν ἀλήθειαν δὲ\r\nἀγαπῶν ἐν πᾶσιν. ἧς εἴ τις ἑκὼν ἁμαρτάνοι, τὴν ἐκ τοῦ κολακεύειν αἰσχύνην\r\nοὐδαμῶς ἐκφεύγει, προστίθησι δὲ τοῖς ἐπαινουμένοις τὸ δοκεῖν μηδ᾽ ὑπὲρ τῶν\r\nἄλλων εὖ ἀκούειν κατὰ τὴν ἀξίαν· ὃ παθεῖν εὐλαβησόμεθα. δείξει δὲ ὁ λόγος\r\nαὐτός, εἰ μηδαμοῦ τὸ ψεῦδος πρὸ τῆς ἀληθείας τετίμηκεν. οὐκοῦν εὖ οἶδα,\r\nὅτι πάντες ἂν μέγιστον φήσειαν πλεονέκτημα τῶν βαρβάρων τὸν πρὸ τῶν\r\nΣιγγάρων πόλεμον.

For when a man\r\ndeliberately sins against the truth he cannot escape the reproach of\r\nflattery, and moreover he inflicts on the object of his panegyric the\r\nappearance of not deserving the praise that he receives on other accounts.\r\nThis is a mistake of which I shall beware. Indeed my speech will make it\r\nclear that in no case has fiction been preferred to the truth. Now I am\r\nwell aware that all would say that the battle we fought before\r\nSingara(104) was a most important victory for the barbarians. But I should\r\nanswer and with justice that this battle inflicted equal loss on both\r\narmies, but proved also that your valour could accomplish more than their\r\nluck; and that although the legions under you were violent and reckless\r\nmen, and were not accustomed, like the enemy, to the climate and the\r\nstifling heat. I will relate exactly what took place. It was still the\r\nheight of summer, and the legions mustered long before noon. Since the\r\nenemy were awestruck by the discipline, accoutrements and calm bearing of\r\nour troops, while to us they seemed amazing in numbers, neither side began\r\nthe battle; for they shrank from coming to close quarters with forces so\r\nwell equipped, while we waited for them to begin, so that in all respects\r\nwe might seem to be acting rather in self‐defence, and not to be\r\nresponsible for beginning hostilities after the peace. But at last the\r\nleader(105) of the barbarian army, raised high on their shields, perceived\r\nthe magnitude of our forces drawn up in line. What a change came over him!\r\nWhat exclamations he uttered! He cried out that he had been betrayed, that\r\nit was the fault of those who had persuaded him to go to war, and decided\r\nthat the only thing to be done was to flee with all speed, and that one\r\ncourse alone would secure his safety, namely to cross, before we could\r\nreach it, the river, which is the ancient boundary‐line between that\r\ncountry and ours. With this purpose he first gave the signal for a retreat\r\nin good order, then gradually increasing his pace he finally took to\r\nheadlong flight, with only a small following of cavalry, and left his\r\nwhole army to the leadership of his son and the friend in whom he had most\r\nconfidence. When our men saw this they were enraged that the barbarians\r\nshould escape all punishment for their audacious conduct, and clamoured to\r\nbe led in pursuit, chafed at your order to halt, and ran after the enemy\r\nin full armour with their utmost energy and speed. For of your generalship\r\nthey had had no experience so far, and they could not believe that you\r\nwere a better judge than they of what was expedient. Moreover, under your\r\nfather they had fought many battles and had always been victorious, a fact\r\nthat tended to make them think themselves invincible. But they were most\r\nof all elated by the terror that the Parthians now shewed, when they\r\nthought how they had fought, not only against the enemy, but against the\r\nvery nature of the ground, and if any greater obstacle met them from some\r\nfresh quarter, they felt that they would overcome it as well. Accordingly\r\nthey ran at full speed for about one hundred stades, and only halted when\r\nthey came up with the Parthians, who had fled for shelter into a fort that\r\nthey had lately built to serve as a camp. It was, by this time, evening,\r\nand they engaged battle forthwith. Our men at once took the fort and slew\r\nits defenders. Once inside the fortifications they displayed great bravery\r\nfor a long time, but they were by this time fainting with thirst, and when\r\nthey found cisterns of water inside, they spoiled a glorious victory and\r\ngave the enemy a chance to retrieve their defeat. This then was the issue\r\nof that battle, which caused us the loss of only three or four of our men,\r\nwhilst the Parthians lost the heir to the throne(106) who had previously\r\nbeen taken prisoner, together with all his escort. While all this was\r\ngoing on, of the leader of the barbarians not even the ghost was to be\r\nseen, nor did he stay his flight till he had put the river behind him.\r\nYou, on the other hand, did not take off your armour for a whole day and\r\nall the night, now sharing the struggles of those who were getting the\r\nupper hand, now giving prompt and efficient aid to those who were hard‐\r\npressed. And by your bravery and fortitude you so changed the face of the\r\nbattle that at break of day the enemy were glad to beat a safe retreat to\r\ntheir own territory, and even the wounded, escorted by you, could retire\r\nfrom the battle. Thus did you relieve them all from the risks of flight.\r\nNow what fort was taken by the enemy? What city did they besiege? What\r\nmilitary supplies did they capture that should give them something to\r\nboast about after the war?)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἴσως, φήσει τισ, τὸ μηδέποτε τῶν πολεμίων ἧττον ἔχοντα ἀπελθεῖν\r\nεὐτυχὲς καὶ εὔδαιμον ἡγητέον,(107) τὸ δὲ ἀντιστῆναι τῇ τύχῃ ῥωμαλεώτερον\r\nκαὶ(108) μείζονος ἀρετῆς ὑπάρχει σημεῖον.\r\n\r\n(But perhaps some one will say that never to come off worse than the enemy\r\nmust indeed be considered good fortune and felicity, but to make a stand\r\nagainst fortune calls for greater vigour and is a proof of greater\r\nvalour.)\r\n\r\nΤίς μὲν γὰρ ἀγαθὸς κυβερνήτης ἐν εὐδίᾳ τὴν ναῦν κατευθύνων, [C] γαλήνης\r\nἀκριβοῦς κατεχούσης τὸ πέλαγος; τίς δὲ ἡνίοχος ἅρματος δεξιὸς ἐν ὁμαλῷ καὶ\r\nλείῳ χωρίῳ εὐπειθεῖς καὶ πρᾴους καὶ ταχεῖς ἵππους ζευξάμενος, εἶτα ἐν\r\nτούτοις ἐπιδεικνύμενος τὴν τέχνην; πόσῳ δὲ ἀμείνων νεὼς μὲν ἰθυντὴρ ὁ καὶ\r\nτὸν μέλλοντα χειμῶνα προμαθὼν καὶ προαισθόμενος καὶ πειραθείς γε τοῦτον\r\nἐκκλῖναι, εἶτα δι᾽ ἁσδηποτοῦν αἰτίας ἐμπεσὼν καὶ διασώσας ἀπαθῆ τὴν ναῦν\r\nαὐτῷ φόρτῳ; [D] ἄρματος δ᾽ ἐπιστάτης ὁ καὶ πρὸς χωρίων ἀγωνιζόμενος\r\nτραχύτητα καὶ τοὺς ἵππους μετατιθεὶς ἅμα καὶ βιαζόμενος, ἤν τι\r\nπλημμελῶσιν; ὅλως δὲ οὐδεμίαν ἄξιον τέχνην μετὰ τῆς τύχης ἐξετάζειν, ἀλλ᾽\r\nαὐτὴν ἐφ᾽ αὑτῆς σκοπεῖν. οὐδὲ στρατηγὸς ἀμείνων ὁ Κλέων Νικίου, ἐπειδὴ τὰ\r\nπερὶ τὴν Πύλον ηὐτύχησεν, οὐδ᾽ ἄλλος οὐδεὶς τῶν τύχῃ μᾶλλον ἢ γνώμῃ\r\nκρατούντων. ἐγὼ δὲ εἰ μὴ καὶ τὴν τύχην τὴν σὴν ἀμείνω καὶ δικαιοτέραν τῆς\r\nτῶν ἀντιταξαμένων, μᾶλλον δὲ τῆς ἁπάντων ἀνθρώπων κρατίστην φήσαιμι, [26]\r\nἀδικεῖν ἂν εἰκότως δοκοίην, τὴν μὴ παρασχοῦσαν τοῖς πολεμίοις αἰσθέσθαι τὸ\r\nπλεονέκτημα. χρὴ γὰρ οἶμαι τὸν δικαίως ὑπὲρ τῶν ῥηθέντων κρινοῦντα(109) τὸ\r\nμὲν ἐλάττωμα τῇ τοῦ πνίγους ἀνανταγωνίστῳ ῥώμῃ λογίζεσθαι, τὸ δὲ εἰς ἴσον\r\nκαταστῆσαι τοὺς πολεμίους ταῖς συμφοραῖς τῆς σῆς ἀρετῆς ἔργον ὑπολαβεῖν,\r\nτὸ δὲ τῶν μὲν οἰκείων αἰσθέσθαι συμφορῶν, ἀγνοῆσαι δὲ τὰ κατορθώματα τῆς\r\nἀγαθῆς τύχης ἔργον λογέζεσθαι.\r\n\r\n(Is a man a skilful pilot because he can steer his ship in fair weather\r\nwhen the sea is absolutely calm? Would you call a charioteer an expert\r\ndriver who on smooth and level ground has in harness horses that are\r\ngentle, quiet and swift, and under such conditions gives a display of his\r\nart? How much more skilful is the pilot who marks and perceives beforehand\r\nthe coming storm and tries to avoid its path, and then, if for any reason\r\nhe must face it, brings off his ship safe and sound, cargo and all? Just\r\nso, the skilful charioteer is he who can contend against the unevenness of\r\nthe ground, and guide his horses and control them at the same time, if\r\nthey grow restive. In short, it is not fair to judge of skill of any sort\r\nwhen it is aided by fortune, but one must examine it independently. Cleon\r\nwas not a better general than Nicias because he was fortunate in the\r\naffair of Pylos, and the same may be said of all whose success is due to\r\nluck rather than to good judgment. But if I did not claim that your\r\nfortune was both better and better deserved than that of your opponents,\r\nor rather of all men, I should with reason be thought to do it an\r\ninjustice, since it prevented the enemy from even perceiving their\r\nadvantage. For, in my opinion, an impartial judge of my narrative ought to\r\nascribe our reverse to the extreme and insupportable heat, and the fact\r\nthat you inflicted loss on the enemy equal to ours he would regard as\r\nachieved by your valour, but that, though they were aware of their losses,\r\nthey took no account of their success, he would regard as brought about by\r\nyour good fortune.)\r\n\r\n[B] Ἀλλ᾽ ὅπως μὴ μακρότερα περὶ τούτων λέγων τὸν ὑπὲρ τῶν μειζόνων καιρὸν\r\nἀναλώσω, πειράσομαι λοιπὸν τὸ μετὰ τοῦτο περιστὰν ἡμᾶς τῶν πραγμάτων\r\nπλῆθος διεξιέναι(110) καὶ τῶν κινδύνων τὸ μέγεθος, καὶ ὅπως ἅπασιν\r\nἀντισχὼν τυράννων μὲν πλῆθος, βαρβάρων δὲ ἐτρέψω δυνάμεις. ἦν μὲν γὰρ ὁ\r\nχειμὼν ἐπ᾽ ἐξόδοις ἤδη, ἕκτον που μάλιστα μετὰ τὸν πόλεμον ἔτος, οὗ μικρῷ\r\nπρόσθεν ἐμνήσθην, [C] ἧκε δὲ ἀγγέλλων τισ, ὡς Γαλατία μὲν συναφεστῶσα τῷ\r\nτυράννῳ ἀδελφῷ τῷ σῷ ἐβοὐλευσέ τε καὶ ἐπετέλεσε τὸν φόνον, εἶτα ὡς Ἰταλία\r\nκαὶ Σικελία κατείληπται, τὰ δὲ ἐν Ἰλλυριοῖς στρατόπεδα ταραχωδῶς ἔχει καὶ\r\nΒασιλέα σφῶν ἀπέδειξε τὸν τέως στρατηγὸν ἀντισχεῖν ἐθέλοντα πρὸς τὴν\r\nἄμαχον δοκοῦσαν τῶν τυράννων φοράν. ἱκέτευε δὲ αὐτὸς οὗτος χρήματα πέμπειν\r\nκαὶ δύναμιν τὴν βοηθήσουσαν, σφόδρα ὑπὲρ αὑτοῦ δεδιὼς καὶ τρέμων, μὴ πρὸς\r\nτῶν τυράννων κρατηθείη.

About six years had passed\r\nsince the war I have just described, and the winter was nearly over, when\r\na messenger arrived with the news(113) that Galatia(114) had gone over to\r\nthe usurper, that a plot had been made to assassinate your brother and had\r\nbeen carried out, also that Italy and Sicily had been occupied, lastly\r\nthat the Illyrian garrisons were in revolt and had proclaimed their\r\ngeneral(115) emperor, though for a time he had been inclined to resist\r\nwhat seemed to be the irresistible onset of the usurpers.(116) Indeed, he\r\nhimself kept imploring you to send money and men to his aid, as though he\r\nwere terribly afraid on his own account of being overpowered by them. And\r\nfor a while he kept protesting that he would do his duty, that for his\r\npart he had no pretensions to the throne, but would faithfully guard and\r\nprotect it for you. Such were his assertions, but it was not long before\r\nhis treachery came to light and he received his punishment, tempered\r\nthough it was with mercy. On learning these facts you thought you ought\r\nnot to waste your time in idleness to no purpose. The cities of Syria you\r\nstocked with engines of war, garrisons, food supplies, and equipment of\r\nother kinds, considering that, by these measures, you would, though\r\nabsent, sufficiently protect the inhabitants, while you were planning to\r\nset out in person against the usurpers.)\r\n\r\nΠέρσαι δὲ ἐξ ἐκείνου τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον παραφυλάξαντες, ὡς ἐξ ἐφόδου τὴν\r\nΣυρίαν ληψόμενοι, πᾶσαν ἐξαναστήσαντες ἡλικίαν καὶ φύσιν καὶ τύχην ἐφ᾽\r\nἡμᾶς ὥρμηντο, ἄνδρες, μειράκια, πρεσβῦται καὶ γυναικῶν πλῆθος καὶ\r\nθεραπόντων, οὐ μόνον τῶν πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον ὑπουργιῶν χάριν, ἐκ περιουσίας\r\nδὲ πλεῖστον ἑπόμενον. διενοοῦντο γὰρ ὡς καὶ τὰς πόλεις [B] καθάξοντες καὶ\r\nτῆς χώρας ἤδη κρατήσαντες κληρούχους ἡμῖν ἐπάγειν.(117) κενὰς δὲ ἀπέφηνεν\r\nαὐτοῖς τὰς προσδοκίας τῆς παρασκευῆς τῆς σῆς τὸ μέγεθος. ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἐς\r\nπολιορκίαν κατέστησαν, ἐπετειχίζετο μὲν ἡ πόλις κύκλῳ τοῖς χώμασιν,\r\nἐπέρρει δὲ ὁ Μυγδόνιος πελαγίζων τὸ περὶ τῷ τείχει χωρίον, καθάπερ ὁ\r\nΝεῖλος, φασὶ, τὴν Αἴγυπτον. προσήγετο δὲ ἐπὶ νεῶν ταῖς ἐπάλξεσι τὰ\r\nμηχανήματα, καὶ ἐπιπλεῖν ἄλλοι διενοοῦντο τοῖς τείχεσιν, [C] ἄλλοι δὲ\r\nἔβαλλον ἀπὸ τῶν χωμάτων τοὺς ἀμυνομένους ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως. οἱ δὲ ἐκ τῶν\r\nτειχῶν ἤμυνον καρτερῶς τῇ πίλει. μεστὰ δὲ ἦν ἅπαντα σωμάτων καὶ ναυαγίων\r\nκαὶ ὅπλων καὶ βελῶν, τῶν μὲν ἄρτι καταδυομένων, τῶν δέ, ἐπειδὴ τὸ πρῶτον\r\nὑπὸ τῆς βίας κατενεχθέντα κατέδυ, κουφιζομένων ὑπὸ τοῦ κύματος. ἀσπίδες\r\nμὲν ἐπενήχοντο βαρβάρων παμπληθεῖς καὶ νεῶν σέλματα(118) συντριβομένων ἐπ᾽\r\nαὐταῖς τῶν μηχανημάτων.

So they mustered all forces, every age, sex, and condition, and\r\nmarched against us, men and mere boys, old men and crowds of women and\r\nslaves, who followed not merely to assist in the war, but in vast numbers\r\nbeyond what was needed. For it was their intention to reduce the cities,\r\nand once masters of the country, to bring in colonists in spite of us. But\r\nthe magnitude of your preparations made it manifest that their\r\nexpectations were but vanity. They began the siege and completely\r\nsurrounded the city(120) with dykes, and then the river Mygdonius flowed\r\nin and flooded the ground about the walls, as they say the Nile floods\r\nEgypt. The siege‐engines were brought up against the ramparts on boats,\r\nand their plan was that one force should sail to attack the walls while\r\nthe other kept shooting on the city’s defenders from the mounds. But the\r\ngarrison made a stout defence of the city from the walls. The whole place\r\nwas filled with corpses, wreckage, armour, and missiles, of which some\r\nwere just sinking, while others, after sinking from the violence of the\r\nfirst shock, floated on the waters. A vast number of barbarian shields and\r\nalso ship’s benches, as a result of the collisions of the siege‐engines on\r\nthe ships, drifted on the surface. The mass of floating weapons almost\r\ncovered the whole surface between the wall and the mounds. The lake was\r\nturned to gore, and all about the walls echoed the groans of the\r\nbarbarians, slaying not, but being slain(121) in manifold ways and by all\r\nmanner of wounds.)\r\n\r\nΤίς ἂν ἀξίως τῶν δρωμένων διηγοῖτο; πῦρ μὲν ἐνίετο ταῖς ἀσπίσιν, ἐξέπιπτον\r\nδὲ τῶν ὁπλιτῶν ἡμίκαυτοι πολλοί, ἄλλοι δὲ ἀποδιδράσκοντες τὴν φλόγα τὸν ἐκ\r\nτῶν βελῶν οὐκ ἀπέφευγον κίνδυνον· [28] ἀλλ᾽ οἱ μὲν ἔτι νηχόμενοι τὰ νῶτα\r\nτρωθέντες ἐς βυθὸν κατεδύοντο, οἱ δὲ ἐξαλλόμενοι τῶν μηχανημάτων πρὶν\r\nὕδατος ἅψασθαι βληθέντες οὐ σωτηρίαν, κουφότερον δὲ εὗρον τὸν(122)\r\nθάνατον. τοὺς δὲ οὐδὲ νεῖν εἰδότας ἀκλεέστερον τῶν πρόσθεν ἀπολλυμένους\r\nτίς ἂν ἀξιώσειεν ἁριθμοῦ καὶ μνήμης; ἐπιλείψει με, καθ᾽ ἕκαστον εἰ πᾶσιν\r\nἐπεξελθεῖν βουλοίμην, ὁ χρόνος· τὸ κεφάλαιον δὲ ἀκούειν ἀπόχρη.

They\r\nhurled fire down on to the shields, and many of the hoplites fell half‐\r\nburned, while others who fled from the flames could not escape the danger\r\nfrom the missiles. But some while still swimming were wounded in the back\r\nand sank to the bottom, while others who jumped from the siege‐engines\r\nwere hit before they touched the water, and so found not safety indeed but\r\nan easier death. As for those who knew not how to swim, and perished more\r\nobscurely than those just mentioned, who would attempt to name or number\r\nthem? Time would fail me did I desire to recount all this in detail. It is\r\nenough that you should hear the sum of the matter. On that day the sun\r\nbeheld a battle the like of which no man had ever known before. These\r\nevents exposed the historic boastings of the Medes as only empty conceit.\r\nTill then men had hardly believed that Xerxes could have had so huge an\r\narmament, seeing that for all its size its fate was so shameful and\r\nignominious; but these events made the fact clearer to us than things long\r\nfamiliar and obvious. Xerxes tried to sail and to march by fighting\r\nagainst the laws of nature, and, as he thought, overcame the nature of the\r\nsea and of the dry land, but he proved to be no match for the wisdom and\r\nendurance of a Greek whose soldiers had not been bred in the school of\r\nluxury, nor learned to be slaves, but knew how to obey and to use their\r\nenergies like free‐born men. That man,(123) however, though he had no such\r\nvast armament as Xerxes, was even more insensate, and outdid the Aloadae\r\nin his infatuation, as if almost he had conceived the idea of overwhelming\r\nthe city with the mountain(124) that was hard by. Then he turned the\r\ncurrents of rivers against its walls and undermined them, but even when\r\nthe city had lost its walls he could not succeed in taking it, so that he\r\nhad not even that triumph to boast of, as Xerxes had when he set fire to\r\nAthens. So, after spending four months, he retreated with an army that had\r\nlost many thousands, and he who had always seemed to be irresistible was\r\nglad to keep the peace, and to use as a bulwark for his own safety the\r\nfact that you had no time to spare and that our own affairs were in\r\nconfusion.)\r\n\r\nΤαῦτα καταλιπὼν ἐπὶ τῆς Ἀσίας τρόπαια καὶ νίκας, [29] ἐπὶ τὴν Εὐρώπην\r\nἀκμῆτας ἦγες τὸ στράτευμα, τὴν οἰκουμένην ἅπασαν ἐμπλῆσαι τροπαίων\r\nἐγνωκώς. ἐμοὶ δὲ ἀρκεῖ(125) τὰ πρόσθεν ῥηθέντα, εἰ καὶ μηδὲν ἔτι περὶ σοῦ\r\nλέγειν εἶχον σεμνότερον, πρὸς τὸ πάντων ἀποφῆναι σε τῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῆς\r\nαὐτῆς σοι μετασχόντων τύχης συνέσει καὶ ῥώμῃ κρατοῦντα. τὸ γὰρ ἀπαθῶς\r\nὤσασθαι μεὲ τὴν Περσῶν δύναμιν, οὐ πόλιν οὐδὲ φρούριον, ἀλλ᾽ [B] οὐδὲ\r\nστρατιώτην τῶν ἐκ καταλόγου προέμενον, πολιορκίᾳ δὲ τέλος ἐπιθεῖναι\r\nλαμπρὸν καὶ οἷον οὔπω πρόσθεν ἠκούσαμεν, τίνι χρὴ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν παραβαλεῖν\r\nἔργων; περιβόητος γέγονεν ἡ Καρχηδονίων ἐν τοῖς δεινοῖς τόλμα, ἀλλ᾽\r\nἐτελεύτησεν εἰς συμφοράς· λαμπρὰ τὰ περὶ τὴν Πλαταιέων πολιορκίαν\r\nγενόμενα, ἐχρήσαντο δὲ οἱ δείλαιοι γνωριμώτερον τοῖς δυστυχήμασι. τί χρὴ\r\nΜεσσήνης καὶ Πύλου μεμνῆσθαι, οὔτε ἀγωνισαμένων καρτερῶς οὔτε ἁλόντων ξὺν\r\nβίᾳ; [C] Συρακούσιοι δὲ τὸν σοφὸν ἐκεῖνον ἀντιτάξαντες ταῖς παρασκευαῖς\r\nτῆς ἡμετέρας πόλεως καὶ τῷ καλῷ κἀγαθῷ στρατηγῷ τί πλέον ὤναντο; οὐχ\r\nἑάλωσαν μὲν τῶν ἄλλων αἴσχιον, ἐσώζοντο δὲ καλὸν ὑπόμνημα τῆς τῶν ἑλόντων\r\nπρᾳότητος; Ἀλλ᾽ εἰ πάσας ἐξαριθμεῖσθαι τὰς πόλεις βουλοίμην, αἳ πρὸς τὰς\r\nὑποδεεστέρας οὐ κατήρκεσαν παρασκευάς, πόσας οἴει μοι βίβλους ἀρκέσειν;\r\nτῆς Ῥώμης δὲ ἴσως ἄξιον μνησθῆναι πάλαι ποτὲ χρησαμένης τύχῃ τοιαύτῃ, [D]\r\nΓαλατῶν οἶμαι καὶ Κελτῶν ἐς ταύτὸ πνευσάντων καὶ φερομένων ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν\r\nκαθάπερ χειμάρρους ἐξαίφνης. κατέλαβον μὲν γὰρ τὸν λόφον ἐκεῖνον, οὗ τὸ\r\nτοῦ Διὸς ἀφίδρυται βρέτας; γέρροις δὲ καί τισι τοιούτοις οἱονεὶ τείχει\r\nφραξάμενοι, πολυπραγμονούντων οὐδὲν προσιέναι τῶν πολεμίων βίᾳ τολμώντων,\r\nἐκράτησαν.\r\n\r\n(Such were the trophies and victories that you left behind you in Asia,\r\nand you led your troops to Europe in perfect condition, determined to fill\r\nthe whole world with the monuments of your victories. Even if I had\r\nnothing more wonderful to relate about you, what I have said is enough to\r\ndemonstrate that in good sense and energy you surpass all those in the\r\npast whose fortune was the same as yours. Indeed to have repulsed the\r\nwhole strength of Persia and remain unscathed, not to have lost so much as\r\na soldier from the ranks, much less a town or fort, and finally to have\r\nbrought the siege to so brilliant and unprecedented a conclusion,—what\r\nachievement I ask in the past could one compare with this? The\r\nCarthaginians were famous for their daring in the face of danger, but they\r\nended in disaster. The siege of Plataea shed lustre on its citizens, but\r\nall that their valour could do for those unhappy men was to make their\r\nmisfortunes more widely known. What need to quote Messene or Pylos, since\r\nthere the defeated did not make a brave defence nor was a vigorous assault\r\nnecessary to subdue them? As for the Syracusans, they had their famous man\r\nof science(126) to aid them against the armaments of Rome and our\r\nillustrious general,(127) but what did he avail them in the end? Did they\r\nnot fall more ignominiously than the rest, and were only spared to be a\r\nglorious monument of their conqueror’s clemency? But if I wished to reckon\r\nup all the states that could not withstand armaments inferior to their\r\nown, how many volumes do you think would suffice? Rome, however, I ought\r\nperhaps to mention, because long ago she had just such a fortune, I mean\r\nwhen the Galatians and Celts(128) conspired together, and without warning\r\npoured down on the city like a winter torrent.(129) The citizens occupied\r\nthe famous hill(130) on which stands the statue of Jupiter. There they\r\nintrenched themselves with wicker barricades and such like defences, as\r\nthough with a wall, while the enemy offered no hindrance nor ventured to\r\napproach to attack at close quarters, and so they won the day.)\r\n\r\n[30] Ταύτῃ παραβαλεῖν ἄξιον τῇ πολιορκίᾳ τὴν ἔναγχος τῷ τέλει τῆς τύχης,\r\nἐπεὶ τοῖς γε ἔργοις οὐδεμιᾷ τῶν ὅσαι πάλαι γεγόνασι. τίς γὰρ ἔγνω\r\nκυκλουμένην μὲν ὕδασι πόλιν,(131) λόφοις δὲ ἔξωθεν καθάπερ δικτύοις\r\nπεριβληθεῖσαν, καὶ ποταμὸν ἐπαφιέμενον οἱονεὶ μηχάνημα, συνεχῶς ῥέοντα καὶ\r\nπροσρηγνύμενον τοῖς τείχεσι, τάς τε ὑπὲρ τῶν ὑδάτων μάχας καὶ ὅσαι περὶ τῷ\r\nτείχει κατενεχθέντι γεγόνασιν;(132) ἐμοὶ μὲν οὖν, ὅπερ ἔφην, ἀπόχρη καὶ\r\nταῦτα· τὰ λειπόμενα δέ ἐστι μακρῷ σεμνότερα.

For who ever heard of surrounding a city with\r\nwater, and from without throwing hills about it like nets, then hurling at\r\nit, like a siege‐engine, a river that flowed in a steady stream and broke\r\nagainst its walls, or of fighting like that which took place in the water\r\nand about the wall where it had fallen in? For my purpose, this is, as I\r\nsaid, evidence enough. But what remains to tell is far more awe‐inspiring.\r\nAnd perhaps, since I have undertaken to record, as far as possible, all\r\nthat you accomplished, it is not fair to break off my narrative at the\r\npoint where you were at the very height of your activity. For even while\r\nyou were occupied by the interests I have just described, you arranged\r\nyour affairs in Europe, despatching embassies, spending money, and sending\r\nout the legions that were garrisoning Paeonia against the Scythians, all\r\nof which was with the intention of preventing that feeble old man(133)\r\nfrom being overpowered by the usurper.(134) But how could one, with the\r\nbest will in the world, present all this in a short speech?)\r\n\r\nἘπει δέ, ἤδη σου πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον ὡρμημένου, οὐκ οἶδα παρ᾽ ὅτου δαιμόνων\r\nἐξαιρεθεὶς τὸν νοῦν καὶ τὰς φρένας ὁ τέως πιστὸς μενεῖν φύλαξ\r\nἐπαγγελλόμενος καὶ χρήμασι καὶ στρατοπέδοις καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν ὑπὸ σοῦ\r\nπερισωζόμενος εἰρήνην ὡμολόγησε τῷ πάντων ἀνθρώπων ἀνοσιωτάτῳ καὶ πολεμίῳ\r\nκοινῇ μὲν ἁπάντων, ὁπόσοις εἰρήνης μέλει καὶ τὴν ὁμόνοιαν ἐκ παντὸς\r\nστέργουσιν, [D] ἰδίᾳ δὲ σοὶ καὶ πλέον τῶν ἄλλων· οὔτε ἔδεισας τῆς\r\nπαρασκευῆς τὸ μέγεθος οὔτε ἀπίστων ἀνδρῶν ξυμμαχίαν πλέον ἔχειν(135)\r\nὑπέλαβες τῆς ἔμφρονος γνώμης. ἐγκαλῶν δέ, ὡς εἰκός, τῷ μὲν ἀπιστίαν, τῷ δὲ\r\nπρὸς ταύτῃ πράξεων ἀναγῶν καὶ παρανόμων τολμήματα, τὸν μὲν εἰς δίκην καὶ\r\nκρίσιν ἐπὶ τῶν στρατοπέδων προυκάλεις, τοῦ δὲ κριτὴν ὑπελάμβανες εἶναι τὸν\r\nπόλεμον. ἀλλ᾽ ἐπειδὴ πρῶτον ὁ καλὸς καὶ συνετὸς ἀπήντα πρεσβύτης, [31]\r\nεὐχερέστερον παιδαρίου τινὸς μετατιθέμενος τὰ δόξαντα καὶ ὧν εὖ πάθοι\r\nδεόμενος μετὰ τὴν χρείαν ἐπιλήσμων· παρῆν δὲ ἄγων ὁπλιτῶν φάλαγγας καὶ\r\nτάξεις ἱππέων, ὡς, εἰ μὴ πείθοι, βιασόμενος σε(136) ὀπίσω πάλιν ἀπιέναι\r\nτὴν αὐτὴν ἄπρακτον· οὐδὲν ἐκπλαγείς, ὅτι τὸν σύμμαχον καὶ στρατηγὸν μενεῖν\r\nἐπαγγελλόμενον πολέμιον εἶδες ἐξ ἴσης ἄρχειν ἐθέλοντα, καίτοι τῷ πλήθει\r\nτῶν στρατευμάτων ἐλαττούμενος, ἐπεὶ μὴ πάντες εἵποντο, [B] πρὸς πλήθει\r\nκρατοῦντα διαγωνίζεσθαι τολμηρὸν μὲν ἴσως, σφαλερὸν δὲ πάντως(137)\r\nὑπολαβὼν καὶ κρατήσαντι τῇ μάχῃ διὰ τὸν ἐφεδρεύοντα τοῖς καιροῖς καὶ τοῖς\r\nπράγμασιν ἄγριον τύραννον, ἐβουλεύσω καλῶς μόνον εἶναι σὸν ἐθέλων τὸ\r\nκατόρθωμα, καὶ παρῄεις ἐπὶ τὸ βῆμα μετὰ τοῦ τέως συνάρχοντος· συνῄει δὲ\r\nὁπλίτης δῆμος στίλβων τοῖς ὅπλοις, τὰ ξίφη γυμνὰ καὶ τὰ δόρατα\r\nπροτείνοντες, [C] δειλῷ μὲν φρικῶδες καὶ δεινὸν θέαμα, εὐψύχῳ δὲ καὶ\r\nθαρραλέῳ καὶ οἷος αὐτὸς γέγονας ὄφελος γενναῖον. οὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ πρῶτον ἤρξω\r\nτῶν λόγων, σιγὴ μὲν ἐπέσχε, πρὸς τὴν ἀκοὴν ὡρμημένων πάντων, τὸ στράτευμα·\r\nδάκρυα δὲ προυχεῖτο πολλοῖς, καὶ ἐς τὸν οὐρανὸν τὰς χεῖρας ὤρεγον, σιγῇ\r\nκαὶ ταῦτα δρῶντες, ὡς μήτις αἴσθηται. τὴν εὔνοιαν δὲ οἱ μὲν ἐνεδείκνυντο\r\nκαὶ(138) διὰ τῆς ὄψεως, πάντες δὲ τῷ σφόδρα ὡρμῆσθαι τῶν λόγων ἀκούειν.\r\n[D] ἀκμαζούσης δὲ τῆς δημηγορίας συνενθουσιῶντες τῷ λόγῳ πάντες\r\nἐπεκρότουν, εἶτα αὖθις ἀκούειν ἐπιθυμοῦντες ἡσύχαζον. τέλος δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν\r\nλόγων ἀναπειθόμενοι σὲ(139) μόνον ἐκάλουν βασιλέα, μόνον ἄρχειν ἠξίουν\r\nἁπάντων, ἡγεῖσθαι σφῶν ἐκέλευον ἐπὶ τὸν πολέμιον, ἀκολουθήσειν ὡμολόγουν,\r\nἀπολαμβάνειν ἠξίουν τῆς ἀρχῆς τὰ γνωρίσματα. σὺ δὲ οὐδὲ τὴν χεῖρα\r\nπροσάγειν ᾤου δεῖν οὐδὲ ἀφελέσθαι ξὺν βίᾳ· ὁ δὲ ἄκων μὲν καὶ μόλις, εἴξας\r\nδὲ ὅμως ὀψέ ποτε, φασί, τῇ Θετταλικῇ πειθανάνκῃ, [32] προσῆγέ σοι\r\nπεριελόμενος τὴν ἁλουργίδα. οἷός τις ἐνταῦθα γέγονας τοσούτων μὲν ἐθνῶν\r\nκαὶ στρατοπέδων καὶ χρημάτων ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ γεγονὼς κύριος, τὸν πολέμιον δέ,\r\nεἰ καὶ μὴ τοῖς ἔργοις, ἀλλα τῇ γνώμῃ φανέντα, τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀφελόμενος καὶ τοῦ\r\nσώματος κρατήσας;\r\n\r\n(No sooner had you set out for the seat of war, than this very man, who\r\nhad all along protested that he would loyally continue to guard your\r\ninterests, though you had reinforced him with money, troops, and\r\neverything of the sort, was driven to folly and madness by I know not what\r\nevil spirit, and came to terms with the most execrable of mankind, the\r\ncommon enemy of all who care for peace and cherish harmony above all\r\nthings, and more particularly your enemy for personal reasons. But you\r\nwere undismayed by the magnitude of his preparations, nor would you admit\r\nthat a conspiracy of traitors could overreach your own wise purpose.\r\nOne(140) of the pair you justly accused of treason, the other(141) of\r\ninfamous crimes besides, and deeds of lawless violence, and you summoned\r\nthe former to trial and judgment before the legions, the latter you\r\ndecided to leave to the arbitrament of war. Then he met you face to face,\r\nthat honourable and prudent old man, who used to change his opinions more\r\neasily than any child, and, though he had begged for them, forgot all your\r\nfavours as soon as the need had passed. He arrived with his phalanxes of\r\nhoplites and squadrons of cavalry, intending to compel, if he could not\r\npersuade you, to take no action and return the way you came. When, then,\r\nyou saw this man, who had protested that he would continue to be your ally\r\nand general, playing an enemy’s part and claiming an equal share of your\r\nempire, you were not at all dismayed, though his troops outnumbered yours.\r\nFor you had not brought your whole force with you since you decided that\r\nto fight it out with such odds against you might be courageous but was in\r\nevery way hazardous, even if you won the battle, because of that other\r\nsavage usurper(142) who was lying in wait for a favourable\r\nopportunity(143) when you should be in difficulties. You therefore made a\r\nwise resolve in preferring to achieve success single‐handed, and you\r\nmounted the platform with him who for the moment was your colleague in\r\nempire. He was escorted by a whole host of hoplites with glittering\r\nweapons,(144) presenting drawn swords and spears, a sight to make a coward\r\nshake with fear, though it inspired and supported one so brave and gallant\r\nas yourself. Now when first you began to speak, silence fell on the whole\r\narmy and every man strained his ears to hear. Many shed tears and raised\r\ntheir hands to heaven, though even this they did in silence, so as to be\r\nunobserved. Some again showed their affection in their faces, but all\r\nshowed it by their intense eagerness to hear your words. When your speech\r\nreached its climax, they were carried away by enthusiasm and burst into\r\napplause, then eager to miss no word they became quiet again. Finally, won\r\nby your arguments, they hailed you as their only Emperor, demanded that\r\nyou alone should rule the whole empire, and bade you lead them against\r\nyour adversary, promising to follow you and begging you to take back the\r\nimperial insignia. You, however, thought it beneath you to stretch out\r\nyour hand for them or to take them by force. Then against his will and\r\nwith reluctance, but yielding at last to what is called Thessalian\r\npersuasion,(145) he took off the purple robe and offered it to you. What a\r\nheroic figure yours was then, when, in a single day, you became master of\r\nall those races, those legions, all that wealth, when you stripped of his\r\npower and took prisoner one who, if not in fact yet in intention, had\r\nshown that he was your enemy!)\r\n\r\nἎρ᾽ οὐ τούτῳ μὲν ἄμεινον καὶ δικαιότερον προσηνέχθης ἢ Κῦρος τῷ πάππῳ,\r\nτοῖς περὶ αὐτὸν δὲ τὰς τιμὰς διεφύλαξας οὐδὲν οὐδενὸς ἀφελόμενος, προσθεὶς\r\nδὲ οἶμαι δωρεὰς πολλοῖς; [B] τίς δέ σ᾽(146) εἶδεν ἢ πρὸ τοῦ κρατῆσαι\r\nσκυθρωπὸν λίαν ἢ μετὰ τοῦθ᾽ ὑπερηδόμενον; καίτοι πῶς(147) ἄξιον ἐπαινεῖν\r\nἐστί σε δημηγόρον ἅμα καὶ στρατηγὸν ἢ βασιλέα χρηστὸν καὶ γενναῖον ὁπλίτην\r\nπροσαγορεύοντας; ὃς πάλαι μὲν ἀπορραγὲν τὸ στρατηγεῖον(148) ἀπὸ τοῦ\r\nβήματος ἐς ταὐτὸν πάλιν ἐπαναγαγεῖν ἠξίωσας σχῆμα, μιμούμενος οἶμαι\r\nὈδυσσέα καὶ Νέστορα καὶ τοὺς ἐξελόντας Καρχηδόνα Ῥωμαίων στρατηγοὺς, [C]\r\nοἳ φοβερωτέρους αὑτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ βήματος τοῖς ἀδικοῦσιν ἢ τοῖς πολεμίοις ἐπὶ\r\nτῆς παρατάξεως ἀεὶ κατέστησαν.

For you deprived your enemy’s followers of\r\nnothing, but protected their privileges and, I understand, gave many of\r\nthem presents besides. Who saw you despondent before your triumph or\r\nunduly elated after it? Orator, general, virtuous emperor, distinguished\r\nsoldier, though men give you all these titles, how can any praise of ours\r\nbe adequate? Long had the orator’s platform been wholly disconnected from\r\nthe general’s functions(153); and it was reserved for you to combine them\r\nonce more in your person, in this surely following the example of Odysseus\r\nand Nestor and the Roman generals who sacked Carthage; for these men were\r\nalways even more formidable to wrong‐doers whom they attacked from the\r\nplatform than to the enemy in the field of battle. Indeed I pay all the\r\nhomage due to the forcible eloquence of Demosthenes and his imitators, but\r\nwhen I consider the conditions of your harangue I can never admit that\r\nthere is any comparison between your theatre and theirs. For they never\r\nhad to address an audience of hoplites nor had they such great interests\r\nat stake, but only money, or honour, or reputation, or friends whom they\r\nhad undertaken to assist, yet when the citizens clamoured in dissent, they\r\noften, I believe, left the platform pale and trembling, like generals who\r\nprove to be cowards when they have to face the enemy in battle‐line.\r\nIndeed from all history it would be impossible to cite an achievement as\r\ngreat as yours when you acquired control of all those races by judicial\r\npleading alone; and moreover you had to make out your case against a man\r\nnot by any means to be despised, as many people think, but one who had won\r\ndistinction in many campaigns, who was full of years, who had the\r\nreputation of experience gained in a long career, and had for a\r\nconsiderable period been in command of the legions there present. What\r\noverwhelming eloquence that must have been! How truly did “persuasion sit\r\non your lips”(154) and had the power to “leave a sting” in the souls of\r\nthat motley crowd of men, and to win you a victory that in importance\r\nrivals any that were ever achieved by force of arms, only that yours was\r\nstainless and unalloyed, and was more like the act of a priest going to\r\nthe temple of his god than of an emperor going to war. It is true indeed\r\nthat the Persians have a similar instance to quote, but it falls far short\r\nof what you did, I mean that on their father’s death the sons of Darius\r\nquarrelled about the succession to the throne and appealed to justice\r\nrather than to arms to arbitrate their case. But between you and your\r\nbrothers there never arose any dispute, either in word or deed, nay not\r\none, for it was in fact more agreeable to you to share the responsibility\r\nwith them than to be the sole ruler of the world. But your quarrel was\r\nwith one who, though his actions had not so far been impious or criminal,\r\nwas shown to have a treasonable purpose, and you brought proofs to make\r\nthat treason manifest.)\r\n\r\nΤαύτην ἐκδέχεται στρατεία λαμπρὰ τὴν δημηγορίαν καὶ πόλεμος ἱερός, οὐχ\r\nὑπὲρ ἱεροῦ χωρίου, ὁποῖον τὸν Φωκικὸν ἀκούομεν συστῆναι(155) κατὰ τοὺς\r\nἔμπροσθεν, [D] ἀλλ᾽ ὑπὲρ τῶν νόμων καὶ τῆς πολιτείας καὶ φόνου πολιτῶν\r\nμυρίων, ὧν τοὺς μὲν ἀνῃρήκει, τοὺς δὲ ἐμέλλησε, τοὺς δὲ ἐπεχείρησε\r\nσυλλαβεῖν, ὥσπερ οἶμαι δεδιὼς μή τις αὐτὸν πολίτην μοχθηρόν, ἀλλ᾽ οὐχὶ\r\nβάρβαρον ὑπολάβῃ φύσει. τὰ γὰρ εἰς τὴν σὴν οἰκίαν ἀδικήματα οὐδενὸς ὄντα\r\nτῶν κοινῇ τολμηθέντων αὐτῷ φαυλότερα καὶ ἐλάττονος ἀξιοῦν ᾤου δεῖν\r\nφροντίδος· οὕτω σοι τὰ κοινὰ πρὸ τῶν ἰδίων ἔδοξε καὶ δοκεῖ τίμια.\r\n\r\n(After your harangue there followed a brilliant campaign and a war truly\r\nsacred, though it was not on behalf of sacred territory, like the Phocian\r\nwar, which we are told was waged(156) in the days of our ancestors, but\r\nwas to avenge the laws and the constitution and the slaughter of countless\r\ncitizens, some of whom the usurper(157) had put to death, while others he\r\nwas just about to kill or was trying to arrest. It was really as though he\r\nwas afraid that otherwise he might be considered, for all his vices, a\r\nRoman citizen instead of a genuine barbarian. As for his crimes against\r\nyour house, though they were quite as flagrant as his outrages against the\r\nstate, you thought it became you to devote less attention to them. So true\r\nit is, that, then as now, you rated the common weal higher than your\r\nprivate interests.)\r\n\r\n[34] Πότερον οὖν χρὴ τῶν ἀδικημάτων ἁπάντων μεμνῆσθαι ὧν εἴς τε(158) τὸ\r\nκοινὸν καὶ κατ᾽ ἰδίαν ἔδρασε, κτείνας μὲν τὸν αὐτὸς αὑτοῦ δεσπίτην·\r\nἁνδράποδον γὰρ ἦν τῶν ἐκείνου προγόνων, τῆς ἁπὸ Γερμανῶν λείας λείψανον\r\nδυστυχὲς περισωζόμενον· ἄρχειν δὲ ἡμῶν ἐπιχειρῶν, ᾧ μηδὲ ἐλευθέρῳ προσῆκον\r\nἦν νομισθῆναι μὴ τοῦτο παρ᾽ ὑμῶν λαβόντι· καὶ ὡς(159) τοὺς ἐπὶ τοῦ\r\nστρατοπέδου ξυνδῶν καὶ ἀποκτιννὺς καὶ δουλεύων αἰσχρῶς τῷ πλήθει καὶ\r\nκολακεύων τὴν εὐταξίαν διέφθειρε· καὶ ὡς τοὺς καλοὺς ἐκείνους ἐτίθει\r\nνόμους, [B] τὴν ἡμίσειαν εἰσφέρειν, θάνατον ἀπειλῶν τοῖς ἀπειθοῦσι,\r\nμηνυτὰς δὲ εἶναι τὸν βουλόμενον τῶν οἰκετῶν· καὶ ὅπως ἠνάγκαζε τοὺς οὐδὲν\r\nδεομένους τὰ βασιλικὰ κτήματα πρίασθαι; ἐπιλείψει με τἀκείνου διηγούμενον\r\nὁ χρόνος ἀδικήματα καὶ τῆς τυραννίδος τῆς καταλαβούσης τὸ μέγεθος. ἀλλὰ\r\nτῆς παρασκευῆς τῆς ἐς τὸν πόλεμον, ἣν κατέβαλε μὲν ἐπὶ τοὺς βαρβάρους, [C]\r\nἐχρήσατο δὲ ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, τὴν ἰσχὺν τίς ἂν(160) ἀξίως παραστήσειε; Κελτοὶ καὶ\r\nΓαλάται, ἔθνη καὶ τοῖς πάλαι φανέντα δυσανταγώνιστα, πολλάκις μὲν\r\nἐπιρρεύσαντα καθάπερ χειμάρρους ἀνυπόστατος Ἰταλοῖς καὶ Ἰλλυριοῖς, ἤδη δὲ\r\nκαὶ τῆς Ἀσίας ἁψάμενα τῷ κρατεῖν τοῖς ἐνόπλοις ἀγῶσιν, ἄκοντες(161) ἡμῖν\r\nὑπήκουσαν, ἔς τε(162) τοὺς καταλόγους τῶν στρατευμάτων ἐγγράφονται καὶ\r\nτέλη παρέχονται λαμπρὰ παρὰ τῶν σῶν προγόνων καὶ πατρὸς κατειλεγμένα·\r\nεἰρήνης δὲ μακρᾶς καὶ τῶν ἐκ ταύτης ἀγαθῶν ἀπολαύοντες, [D] ἐπιδούσης\r\nαὐτοῖς τῆς χώρας πρὸς πλοῦτον καὶ εὐανδρίαν, καὶ ἀδελφοῖς τοῖς σοῖς\r\nστρατιώτας καταλέξαι πολλοὺς παρέσχοντο, τέλος δὲ τῷ τυράννῳ βίᾳ καὶ οὐ\r\nγνώμῃ πανδημεὶ συνεστρατεύοντο. ἠκολούθουν δὲ αὐτῷ κατὰ τὸ ξυγγενὲς\r\nξύμμαχοι προθυμότατοι Φράγγοι καὶ Σάξονες, τῶν ὑπὲρ τὸν Ῥῆνον καὶ\r\nπερὶ(163) τὴν ἑσπερίαν θάλατταν ἐθνῶν τὰ μαχιμώτατα. καὶ [35] πόλις πᾶσα\r\nκαὶ φρούριον πρόσοικον Ῥήνῳ τῶν ἐνοικούντων φυλάκων ἐξερημωθέντα προδέδοτο\r\nμὲν ἀφύλακτα πάντα τοῖς βαρβάροις, ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς δὲ ἐξεπέμπετο παρεσκευασμένον\r\nλαμπρῶς τὸ στράτευμα· πᾶσα δὲ ἐῴκει πόλις Γαλατικὴ στρατοπέδῳ\r\nπαρασκευαζομένῳ πρὸς πόλεμον· καὶ πάντα ἦν ὅπλων καὶ παρασκευῆς ἱππέων καὶ\r\nπεζῶν καὶ τοξοτῶν καὶ ἀκοντιστῶν πλήρη. συρρέοντων [B] δὲ ἐς τὴν Ἰταλίαν\r\nἁπανταχόθεν τῶν ἐκείνου ξυμμάχων καὶ τοῖς ἐνταῦθα πάλαι κατειλεγμένοις\r\nστρατιώταις ἐς ταὐτὸν ἐλθόντων, οὐδεὶς οὕτως ἐφάνη τολμηρός, ὃς οὐκ\r\nἔδεισεν οὐδὲ ἐξεπλάγη τὸν ἐπιόντα χειμῶνα. σκηπτὸς ἐδόκει πᾶσιν ὁ\r\nφερόμενος ἀπὸ τῶν Ἄλπεων, σκηπτὸς ἀφόρητος ἔργῳ καὶ ἄρρητος λόγῳ. τοῦτον\r\nἔδεισαν Ἰλλυριοὶ καὶ Παίονες καὶ Θρᾷκες καὶ Σκύθαι, τοῦτον οἱ τὴν Ἀσίαν\r\nοἰκοῦντες ἄνθρωποι ἐφ᾽ αὑτοὺς ὡρμῆσθαι πάντως ὑπέλαβον, τούτῳ [C]\r\nπολεμέσειν ἤδη περὶ τῆς αὑτῶν καὶ Πέρσαι παρεσκευάζοντο. ὁ δὲ μικρὰ μὲν\r\nἐνόμιζεν εἶναι τὰ παρόντα καὶ πόνον οὐ πολὺν τῆς σῆς συνέσεως καὶ ῥώμης\r\nκρατῆσαι, τοὺς Ἰνδῶν δὲ ἐσκόπει πλούτους καὶ Περσῶν τὴν πολυτέλειαν·\r\nτοσοῦτον(164) αὐτῷ περιῆν ἀνοίας καὶ θράσους ἐκ μικροῦ παντελῶς περὶ τοὺς\r\nκατασκόπους πλεονεκτέματος, οὓς ἀφυλάκτους ὅλῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ λοχήσας\r\nἔκτεινεν. οὕτω τὸ πράττειν εὖ παρὰ τὴν ἀξίαν ἀρχὴ πολλάκις γέγονε τοῖς\r\nἀνοήτοις μειζόνων συμφορῶν.

He assassinated his own master. For he had actually\r\nbeen the slave of the murdered emperor’s ancestors, a miserable remnant\r\nsaved from the spoils of Germany. And then he aimed at ruling over us, he\r\nwho had not even the right to call himself free, had you not granted him\r\nthe privilege. Those in command of the legions he imprisoned and put to\r\ndeath, while to the common soldiers he behaved with such abject servility\r\nand deference that he ruined their discipline. Then he enacted those fine\r\nlaws of his, a property tax of fifty per cent., and threatened the\r\ndisobedient with death, while any slave who pleased might inform against\r\nhis master. Then he compelled those who did not want it to purchase the\r\nimperial property. But time would fail me were I to tell of all his crimes\r\nand of the vast proportions that his tyranny had assumed. As for the\r\narmament which he had collected to use against the barbarians but actually\r\nemployed against us, who could give you an adequate report of its\r\nstrength? There were Celts and Galatians(165) who had seemed invincible\r\neven to our ancestors, and who had so often like a winter torrent that\r\nsweeps all before it,(166) poured down on the Italians and Illyrians, and,\r\nfollowing up their repeated victories on the field of battle, had even\r\ninvaded Asia, and then became our subjects because they had no choice.\r\nThey had been enrolled in the ranks of our armies and furnished levies\r\nthat won a brilliant reputation, being enlisted by your ancestors, and,\r\nlater, by your father. Then, since they enjoyed the blessings of long‐\r\ncontinued peace, and their country increased in wealth and population,\r\nthey furnished your brothers with considerable levies, and finally, by\r\ncompulsion, not choice, they all in a body took part in the usurper’s\r\ncampaign. The most enthusiastic of his followers were, in virtue of their\r\nties of kinship, the Franks and Saxons, the most warlike of the tribes who\r\nlive beyond the Rhine and on the shores of the western sea. And since\r\nevery city and every fortified place on the banks of the Rhine was shorn\r\nof its garrison, that whole region was left with no defence against the\r\nbarbarians, and all that splendidly organised army was despatched against\r\nus. Every town in Galatia(167) was like a camp preparing for war. Nothing\r\nwas to be seen but weapons of war and forces of cavalry, infantry,\r\narchers, and javelin men. When these allies of the usurper began to pour\r\ninto Italy from all quarters and there joined the troops who had been\r\nenrolled long before, there was no one so bold as not to feel terror and\r\ndismay at the tempest that threatened.(168) It seemed to all as though a\r\nthunderbolt had fallen from the Alps, a bolt that no action could avert,\r\nno words describe. It struck terror into the Illyrians, the Paeonians, the\r\nThracians, the Scythians; the dwellers in Asia believed it was directed\r\nentirely against themselves, and even the Persians began to get ready to\r\noppose it in their country’s defence. But the usurper thought his task was\r\neasy, and that he would have little difficulty in baffling your wisdom and\r\nenergy, and already fixed his covetous gaze on the wealth of India and the\r\nmagnificence of Persia. To such an excess of folly and rashness had he\r\ncome, and after a success wholly insignificant, I mean the affair of the\r\nscouts whom, while they were unprotected by the main army, he ambushed and\r\ncut in pieces. So true it is that when fools meet with undeserved\r\nsuccess(169) they often find it is but the prelude to greater misfortunes.\r\nAnd so, elated by this stroke of luck, he left the fortified posts that\r\nprotected the Italian frontier, and marched towards the Norici and the\r\nPaeonians, taking no precautions, because he thought that speed would\r\nserve him better than force of arms or courage.)\r\n\r\nὋ δὴ καταμαθὼν ἐπανῆγες ἀπὸ τῶν δυσχωριῶν τὸ στράτευμα, εἵπετο δὲ ἐκεῖνος,\r\nδιώκειν, οὐχὶ δὲ καταστρατηγεῖσθαι νομίσας, ἕως εἰς τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν ἄμφω\r\nκατέστητε. τῶν πεδίων δὲ τῶν πρὸ τῆς Μύρσης ὀφθέντων, [36] ἐτάττοντο μὲν\r\nἐπὶ κέρως(170) ἱππεῖς ἑκατέρου πεζοί τε ἐν μέσῳ· ἔχων δὲ αὐτός, ὦ βασιλεῦ,\r\nτὸν ποταμὸν ἐν δεξιᾷ, τῷ λαιῷ τοὺς πολεμίους ὑπερβαλλόμενος ἐτρέψω μὲν\r\nεὐθέως καὶ διέλυσας τὴν φάλαγγα οὐδὲ τὴν ἀρχὴν συγκειμένην ὀρθῶς, ἅτε\r\nἀνδρὸς ἀπείρου πολέμων καὶ στρατηγίας αὐτὴν κοσμήσαντος. ὁ δὲ τέως διώκειν\r\nὑπολαμβάνων, οὐδὲ ἐς χεῖρας ἀφικόμενος, [B] ἔφευγε καρτερῶς ἐκπλαγεὶς τὸν\r\nκτύπον τῶν ὅπλων, οὐδὲ τὸν ἐνυάλιον παιᾶνα τῶν στρατοπέδων ἐπαλαλαζόντων\r\nἀδεῶς ἀκούων. διαλυθείσης δὲ οἱ στρατιῶται τῆς τάξεως συνιστάμενοι κατὰ\r\nλόχους πάλιν τὸν ἀγῶνα συνέβαλον, αἰσχυνόμενοι μὲν ὀφθῆναι φεύγοντες καὶ\r\nτὸ τέως ἄπιστον ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις ἐφ᾽ αὑτῶν δεῖξαι συμβαῖνον, στρατιώτην\r\nΚελτόν, στρατιώτην ἐκ Γαλατίας τὰ νῶτα τοῖς πολεμίοις δείξαντα.

When the\r\nplains before Myrsa(172) were in sight, the cavalry of both armies were\r\ndrawn up on the wings, while the infantry formed the centre. Then your\r\nMajesty kept the river on your right, and, outflanking the enemy with your\r\nleft, you at once turned and broke his phalanx, which indeed had from the\r\nfirst the wrong formation, since it had been drawn up by one who knew\r\nnothing of war or strategy. Then he who so far had thought he was the\r\npursuer did not even join battle, but took to headlong flight, dismayed by\r\nthe clash of weapons; he could not even listen without trembling when the\r\nlegions shouted their battle‐song. His ranks had been thrown into\r\ndisorder, but the soldiers formed into companies and renewed the battle.\r\nFor they disdained to be seen in flight, and to give an example in their\r\nown persons of what had hitherto been inconceivable to all men, I mean a\r\nCeltic or Galatian(173) soldier turning his back to the enemy. The\r\nbarbarians too, who, if defeated, could not hope to make good their\r\nretreat, were resolved either to conquer, or not to perish till they had\r\nseverely punished their opponents. Just see the extraordinary daring of\r\nthe usurper’s troops in the face of dangers and their great eagerness to\r\ncome to close quarters!)\r\n\r\nΟἱ δὲ τῶν ὅλων κρατήσαντες, αἰδούμενοι μὲν ἀλλήλους καὶ τὸν βασιλέα,\r\nπαροξυνόμενοι δὲ ὐπὸ τῶν πάλαι κατορθωμάτων καὶ τῶν ἐν χερσὶ λαμπρῶν καὶ\r\nτέως ἀπίστων ἔργων, τέλος [D] ἄξιον τοῖς προϋπηργμένοις ἐπιθεῖναι\r\nφιλοτιμούμενοι πάντα ὑπέμενον ἡδέως πόνον καὶ κίνδυνον. ὥσπερ οὖν ἄρτι τῆς\r\nπαρατάξεως ἀρχομένης, συνιόντες πάλιν ἔργα τόλμης ἀπεδείκνυντο καὶ θυμοῦ\r\nγενναῖα, οἱ μὲν ὠθούμενοι περὶ τοῖς ξίφεσιν, ἄλλοι δὲ λαμβανόμενοι τῶν\r\nἀσπίδων, καὶ τῶν ἱππέων ὁπόσους ἵπποι τρωθέντες ἀπεσείοντο πρὸς τοὺς\r\nὁπλίτας μετεσκευάζοντο. ταῦτα ἔδρων οἱ ξὺν τῷ τυράννῳ τοῖς πεζοῖς\r\nἐπιβρέσαντες· καὶ ἦν ὁ πόλεμος ἐξ ἴσης, ἕως οἱ θωρακοφόροι καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν\r\nτῶν ἱππέων πλῆθος, [37] οἱ μὲν ἐκ τόξων βάλλοντες, ἄλλοι δὲ ἐπελαύνοντες\r\nτοὺς ἵππους, πολλοὺς μὲν ἔκτεινον, ἐδίωκον δὲ ἅπαντας καρτερῶς, τινὰς μὲν\r\nπρὸς τὸ πεδίον ὡρμηκότας φεύγειν, ὧν ἡ νὺξ ὀλίγους ἀπέσωσε μόλις, τὸ\r\nλοιπὸν δὲ ἐς τὸν ποταμὸν κατηνέχθη, καθάπερ βοῶν ἢ βοσκημάτων ἀγέλη\r\nσυνελαυνόμενοι. τοσαῦτα ἐκεῖνο τὸ στράτευμα τῆς τοῦ τυράννου δειλίας,\r\nοὐδὲν ἐκεῖνον ὀνῆσαν ἐκ τῆς [B] ἀνδρείας τῆς αὑτοῦ, μάτην ἀπέλαυσε.\r\n\r\n(Our men, on the other hand, had so far carried all before them and were\r\nanxious to retain the good opinion of their comrades and of the Emperor,\r\nand were moreover stimulated by their successes in the past and by the\r\nalmost incredible brilliance of their exploits in this very engagement,\r\nand, ambitious as they were to end the day as gloriously as they had begun\r\nit, cheerfully encountered toil and danger. So they charged again as\r\nthough the battle had only just begun, and gave a wonderful display of\r\ndaring and heroism. For some hurled themselves full on the enemy’s swords,\r\nor seized the enemy’s shields, others, when their horses were wounded and\r\nthe riders thrown, at once transformed themselves into hoplites. The\r\nusurper’s army meanwhile did the same and pressed our infantry hard.\r\nNeither side gained the advantage, till the cuirassiers by their archery,\r\naided by the remaining force of cavalry, who spurred on their horses to\r\nthe charge, had begun to inflict great loss on the enemy, and by main\r\nforce to drive the whole army before them. Some directed their flight to\r\nthe plain, and of these a few were saved just in time by the approach of\r\nnight. The rest were flung into the river, crowded together like a herd of\r\noxen or brute beasts. Thus did the usurper’s army reap the fruits of his\r\ncowardice, while their valour availed him nothing.)\r\n\r\nΤρόπαιον δὲ ἀνέστησας ἐπὶ τῇ νίκῃ τοῦ πατρῴου λαμπρότερον. ὁ μὲν γὰρ τοὺς\r\nτέως ἀμάχους δοκοῦντας ἄγων ἐκράτει γέροντος δυστυχοῦς· σὺ δὲ ἡβῶσαν καὶ\r\nἀκμάζουσαν οὐ τοῖς κακοῖς μόνον οἷς ἔδρα, τῇ νεότητι δὲ πλέον, τὴν\r\nτυραννίδα παρεστήσω, τοῖς ὑπὸ σοῦ παρασκευασθεῖσι στρατοπέδοις\r\nπαραταξάμενος. τίς γὰρ εἰπεῖν ἔχει τῶν πρόσθεν αὐτοκρατόρων ἱππικὴν\r\nδύναμιν καὶ σκευὴν τῶν [C] ὅπλων τοιαύτην ἐπινοήσαντα καὶ μιμησάμενον; ᾗ\r\nπρῶτος αὐτὸς ἐγγυμνασάμενος διδάσκαλος ἐγένου τοῖς ἄλλοις ὅπλων χρήσεως\r\nἀμάχου. ὑπὲρ ἧς εἰπεῖν τολμήσαντες πολλοὶ τῆς ἀξίας διήμαρτον, ὥσθ᾽ ὅσοι\r\nτῶν λόγων ἀκούσαντες ὕστερον ἰδεῖν ηὐτύχησαν τὰς ἀκοὰς σαφῶς ἀπιστοτέρας\r\nἔγνωσαν εἶναι τῶν ὀμμάτων. ἄπειρον γὰρ ἦγες(174) ἱππέων πλῆθος, καθάπερ\r\nἀνδριάντας ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων ὀχουμένους, οἷς συνήρμοστο τὰ μέλη κατὰ μίμησιν\r\nτῆς ἀνθρωπίνης φύσεως· [D] ἀπὸ μὲν τῶν ἄκρων καρπῶν ἐς τοὺς ἀγκῶνας,\r\nἐκεῖθεν δὲ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους, καὶ ὁ θώραξ ἐκ(175) τμημάτων κατὰ τὸ στέρνον\r\nκαὶ τὰ νῶτα συναρμοζόμενος, τὸ κράνος αὐτῷ προσώπῳ σιδηροῦν ἐπικείμενον\r\nἀνδριάντος λαμπροῦ καὶ στίλβοντος παρέχει τὴν ὄψιν, ἐπεὶ μηδὲ κνῆμαι καὶ\r\nμηροὶ μηδὲ ἄκροι πόδες τῆς σκευῆς ταύτης ἔρημοι λείπονται. συναρμοζομένων\r\nδὲ αὐτῶν τοῖς θώραξι διά τινων ἐκ κρίκου λεπτοῦ πεποιημένων οἱονεὶ\r\nὑφασμάτων οὐδὲν ἂν ὀφθείη τοῦ σώματος γυμνὸν μέρος, ἅτε καὶ τῶν χειρῶν\r\n[38] τοῖς ὑφάσμασι τούτοις σκεπομένων πρὸς τὸ καὶ καμπτομένοις\r\nἐπακολουθεῖν τοῖς δακτύλοις. ταῦτα ὁ λόγος παραστῆσαι μὲν σαφῶς ἐπιθυμεῖ,\r\nἀπολειπόμενος δὲ θεατὰς τῶν ὅπλων τοὺς μαθεῖν τι πλέον ἐθέλοντας, οὐχὶ δὲ\r\nἀκροατὰς τῆς ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν διηγήσεως ἀξιοῖ γενέσθαι.\r\n\r\n(The trophy that you set up for that victory was far more brilliant than\r\nyour father’s. He led an army that had always proved itself invincible,\r\nand with it conquered a miserable old man.(176) But the tyranny that you\r\nsuppressed was flourishing and had reached its height, partly through the\r\ncrimes that had been committed, but still more because so many of the\r\nyouth were on that side, and you took the field against it with legions\r\nthat had been trained by yourself. What emperor can one cite in the past\r\nwho first planned and then reproduced so admirable a type of cavalry, and\r\nsuch accoutrements? First you trained yourself to wear them, and then you\r\ntaught others how to use such weapons so that none could withstand them.\r\nThis is a subject on which many have ventured to speak, but they have\r\nfailed to do it justice, so much so that those who heard their\r\ndescription, and later had the good fortune to see for themselves, decided\r\nthat their eyes must accept what their ears had refused to credit. Your\r\ncavalry was almost unlimited in numbers and they all sat their horses like\r\nstatues, while their limbs were fitted with armour that followed closely\r\nthe outline of the human form. It covers the arms from wrist to elbow and\r\nthence to the shoulder, while a coat of mail protects the shoulders, back\r\nand breast. The head and face are covered by a metal mask which makes its\r\nwearer look like a glittering statue, for not even the thighs and legs and\r\nthe very ends of the feet lack this armour. It is attached to the cuirass\r\nby fine chain‐armour like a web, so that no part of the body is visible\r\nand uncovered, for this woven covering protects the hands as well, and is\r\nso flexible that the wearers can bend even their fingers.(177) All this I\r\ndesire to represent in words as vividly as I can, but it is beyond my\r\npowers, and I can only ask those who wish to know more about this armour\r\nto see it with their own eyes, and not merely to listen to my\r\ndescription.)\r\n\r\nἩμεῖς δὲ ἐπειδὴ τὸν πρῶτον πόλεμον διεληλύθαμεν, ληγούσης ἤδη τῆς ὀπώρας,\r\n[B] ἆρ᾽ ἐνταῦθα τὴν διήγησιν πάλιν ἀφήσομεν; ἢ πάντως τὸ τέλος ἁποδοῦναι\r\nτῶν ἔργων τοῖς ποθοῦσιν(178) ἄξιον; ἐπέλαβε μὲν ὁ χειμὼν καὶ παρέσχε\r\nδιαφυγεῖν τῆν τιμωρίαν τὸν τύραννον. κηρύγματα δὲ ἦν λαμπρὰ καὶ βασιλικῆς\r\nἄξια μεγαλοψυχίας· ἄδεια δὲ πᾶσιν ἐδίδοτο τοῖς ταξαμένοις μετὰ τοῦ\r\nτυράννου, πλὴν εἴ τις ἀνοσίων ἐκείνῳ φόνων ἐκοινώνει· ἀπελάμβανον τὰς\r\nοἰκίας ἅπαντες καὶ τὰ χρήματα καὶ πατρίδας οἱ μηδὲ ὄψεσθαί τι τῶν φιλτάτων\r\nαὐτοῖς ἐλπίζοντες.

Or is it\r\naltogether unfair to withhold the end and issue of your achievements from\r\nthose who are eager to hear? Winter overtook us and gave the usurper a\r\nchance to escape punishment. Then followed a splendid proclamation worthy\r\nof your imperial generosity. An amnesty was granted to those who had taken\r\nsides with the usurper, except when they had shared the guilt of those\r\ninfamous murders. Thus they who had never hoped even to see again anything\r\nthat they held dear, recovered their houses, money, and native land. Then\r\nyou welcomed the fleet which arrived from Italy bringing thence many\r\ncitizens who, no doubt, had fled from the usurper’s savage cruelty. Then\r\nwhen the occasion demanded that you should take the field, you again\r\nmenaced the usurper. He however took cover in the fastnesses of Italy and\r\nhid his army away there in the mountains, wild‐beast fashion, and never\r\neven dared to carry on the war beneath the open heavens. But he betook\r\nhimself to the neighbouring town(180) which is devoted to pleasure and\r\nhigh living, and spent his time in public shows and sensual pleasures,\r\nbelieving that the impassable mountains alone would suffice for his\r\nsafety. Moreover, intemperate as he was by nature, he thought it clear\r\ngain to be able to indulge his appetites at so dangerous a crisis, and he\r\nevidently placed too much confidence in the safety of his position,\r\nbecause the town is cut off from that part of Italy by a natural rampart\r\nof mountains, except the half that is bounded by a shoaling sea, which\r\nresembles the marshes of Egypt and makes that part of the country\r\ninaccessible even to an invading fleet. It seems however as though nature\r\nherself will not devise any safeguard for the sensual and cowardly against\r\nthe temperate and brave, for when prudence and courage advance hand in\r\nhand she makes everything give way before them. Long since she revealed to\r\nus those arts through which we have attained an abundance of what was once\r\nthought to be unattainable, and in the field of individual effort we see\r\nthat what seemed impossible for many working together to achieve can be\r\naccomplished by a prudent man. And since by your own actions you\r\ndemonstrated this fact it is only fair, O my Emperor, that you should\r\naccept my words to that effect.)\r\n\r\nἘστράτευες μὲν γὰρ αὐτὸς ὑπαίθριος, καὶ ταῦτα πλησίον παρούσης πόλεως οὐ\r\nφαύλης, τοῖς στρατευομένοις δὲ οὐκ ἐξ ἐπιτάγματος τὸ πονεῖν καὶ\r\nκινδυνεύειν, ἐξ ὧν δὲ αὐτὸς ἔδρας παρεγγυῶν· ἄτραπον μὲν ἐξηῦρες ἄγνωστον\r\nτοῖς πᾶσι, πέμψας [C] δὲ ἀξιόμαχον τῆς δυνάμεως ἁπάσης ὁπλιτῶν μοῖραν,\r\nεἶτα ἐπειδὴ σαφῶς ἔγνως αὐτοὺς τοῖς πολεμίοις ἐφεστῶτας, αὐτὸς ἀναλαβὼν\r\nἦγες τὸ στράτευμα, καὶ κύκλῳ περιέχων πάντων ἐκράτησας. ταῦτα ἐδρᾶτο πρὸ\r\nτῆς ἕω, ἤγγελτο δὲ πρὸ μεσημβρίας τῷ τυράννῳ ἁμίλλαις ἱππικαῖς καὶ\r\nπανηγύρει προσκαθημένῳ καὶ τῶν παρόντων οὐδὲν ἐλπίζοντι.

You discovered a path hitherto\r\nunknown to all, and you sent forward a strong detachment of hoplites\r\nchosen from your whole army; then when you had ascertained that they had\r\ncome up with the enemy, you led forward your army in person, surrounded\r\nthem, and defeated his whole force. This happened before dawn, and before\r\nnoon the news was brought to the usurper. He was attending a horse‐race at\r\na festival, and was expecting nothing of what took place. How his attitude\r\nchanged, what was his decision about the crisis, how he abandoned the town\r\nand in fact all Italy, and fled, thus beginning to expiate his murders and\r\nall his earlier crimes, it is not for this speech to relate. Yet though\r\nthe respite he gained was so brief, he proceeded to act no less wickedly\r\nthan in the past. So true is it that by the sufferings of the body alone\r\nit is impossible for the wicked to cleanse their souls of evil. For when\r\nhe reached Galatia,(183) this ruler who was so righteous and law‐abiding,\r\nso far surpassed his own former cruelty that he now bethought himself of\r\nall the ruthless and brutal modes of punishment that he had then\r\noverlooked, and derived the most exquisite pleasure from the spectacle of\r\nthe sufferings of the wretched citizens. He would bind them alive to\r\nchariots and, letting the teams gallop, would order the drivers to drag\r\nthem along while he stood by and gazed at their sufferings. In fact he\r\nspent his whole time in amusements of this sort, until, like an Olympic\r\nvictor, you threw him in the third encounter(184) and forced him to pay a\r\nfitting penalty for his infamous career, namely to thrust into his own\r\nbreast that very sword which he had stained with the slaughter of so many\r\ncitizens.(185) Never, in my opinion, was there a punishment more suitable\r\nor more just than this, nor one that gave greater satisfaction to the\r\nwhole human race, which was now really liberated from such cruelty and\r\nharshness, and at once began to exult in the good government that we enjoy\r\nto this day. Long may we continue to enjoy it, O all‐merciful Providence!)\r\n\r\nἘμοὶ δὲ ποθοῦντι μὲν ἐπεξελθεῖν ἅπασι τοῖς σοι πραχθεῖσιν, ἀπολειπομένῳ δὲ\r\nσυγγνώμην εἰκότως, ὦ μέγιστε βασιλεῦ, παρέξεις, εἰ μήτε τῶν ἀποστόλων τῶν\r\nἐπὶ Καρχηδόνα μνημονεύοιμι ἀπό τε Αἰγύπτου παρασκευασθέντων καὶ ἐξ(186)\r\nἸταλίας ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν πλευσάντων, μήτε ὡς τῶν Πυρηναίων ὀρῶν ἐκράτησας ναυσὶν\r\nἐκπέμψας ἐπ᾽ αὐτὰ στράτευμα, μήτε τῶν [D] ἔναγχός σοι πολλάκις πρὸς τοὺς\r\nβαρβάρους πραχθέντων, μήτ᾽ εἴ τι τοιοῦτον ἕτερον τῶν πάλαι γεγονὸς λέληθε\r\nτοὺς πολλούς. ἐπεὶ καὶ τὴν Ἀντιόχου πόλιν ἑαυτὴν σοῦ(187) ἐπώνυμον\r\nἐπονομάζουσαν ἀκούω πολλάκις. ἔστι μὲν γὰρ διὰ τὸν κτίσαντα, πλουτεῖ δὲ\r\nἤδη καὶ πρὸς ἅπασαν εὐπορίαν ἐπιδέδωκε διὰ σὲ λιμένας εὐόρμους τοῖς\r\nκαταίρουσι παρασχόντα· τέως δὲ οὐδὲ παραπλεῖν ἀσφαλὲς οὐδὲ ἀκίνδυνον\r\nἐδόκει· [41] οὕτως ἦν πάντα σκοπέλων τινῶν καὶ πετρῶν ὑφάλων ἀνάπλεα τῆς\r\nθαλάσσης τῆσδε πρὸς ταῖς ᾐόσι. στοὰς δὲ καὶ κρήνας καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα παρὰ\r\nτῶν ὑπάρχων διὰ σὲ γέγονεν οὐδὲ ὀνομάζειν ἄξιον. ὁπόσα δὲ τῇ πατρῴᾳ πόλει\r\nπροστέθεικας, τεῖχος μὲν αὐτῇ κύκλῳ περιβαλὼν ἀρξάμενον τότε, τὰ δοκοῦντα\r\nδὲ οὐκ ἀσφαλῶς ἔχειν(188) τῶν οἰκοδομημάτων εἰς ἀθάνατον ἀσφάλειαν\r\nκατατιθεῖς, τίς ἂν ἀπαριθμήσαιτο; [B] ἐπιλείψει με τούτων ἕκαστον ὁ χρόνος\r\nδιηγούμενον.\r\n\r\n(I would fain recite every single one of your achievements, but you will\r\nwith reason pardon me, most mighty Emperor, if I fall short of that\r\nambition and omit to mention the naval armament against Carthage which was\r\nequipped in Egypt and set sail from Italy to attack her, and also your\r\nconquest of the Pyrenees, against which you sent an army by sea, and your\r\nsuccesses against the barbarians, which of late have been so frequent, and\r\nall such successes in the past as have not become a matter of common\r\nknowledge. For example, I often hear that even Antioch now calls herself\r\nby your name. Her existence she does indeed owe to her founder,(189) but\r\nher present wealth and increase in every sort of abundance she owes to\r\nyou, since you provided her with harbours that offer good anchorage for\r\nthose who put in there. For till then it was considered a dangerous risk\r\neven to sail past Antioch; so full were all the waters of that coast, up\r\nto the very shores, of rocks and sunken reefs. I need not stop to mention\r\nthe porticoes, fountains, and other things of the kind that you caused to\r\nbe bestowed on Antioch by her governors. As to your benefactions to the\r\ncity of your ancestors,(190) you built round it a wall that was then only\r\nbegun, and all buildings that seemed to be unsound you restored and made\r\nsafe for all time. But how could one reckon up all these things? Time will\r\nfail me if I try to tell everything separately.)\r\n\r\nΣκοπεῖν δὲ ὑπὲρ ἁπάντων ἄξιον ἤδη τῶν ῥηθέντων, εἰ μετὰ ἀρετῆς καὶ τῆς\r\nβελτίστης ἕξεως ἅπαντα γέγονε· τούτῳ γὰρ ἤδη καὶ τῶν λόγων ἀρχόμενος\r\nμάλιστα προσέχειν τὸν νοῦν ἠξίουν. οὐκοῦν τῷ πατρὶ μὲν εὐσεβῶς καὶ\r\nφιλανθρώπως ὅπως προσηνέχθης, ὁμονοῶν δὲ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς διετέλεσας τὸν\r\nἅπαντα χρόνον, ἀρχόμενος μὲν προθύμως, [C] συνάρχων δὲ ἐκείνοις σωφρόνως,\r\nπάλαι τε εἴρηται καὶ νῦν ἀξιούσθω μνήμης. τοῦτο δὲ ὅστις μικρᾶς ἀρετῆς\r\nἔργον ὑπέλαβεν Ἀλέξανδρον τὸν Φιλίππου καὶ Κῦρον τὸν Καμβύσου σκοπῶν\r\nἐπαινείτω. ὁ μὲν γὰρ μειράκιον ἔτι κομιδῇ νέον δῆλος ἦν τοῦ πατρὸς οὐκ\r\nἀνεξόμενος ἄρχοντος, ὁ δὲ ἀφείλετο τὴν ἀρχὴν τὸν πάππον. καὶ ταῦτα οὐδείς\r\nἐστιν οὕτως(191) ἠλίθιος, ὅστις οὐκ οἴεταί σε,(192) μηδὲν ἐκείνων\r\nμεγαλοψυχίᾳ καὶ τῇ πρὸς τὰ καλὰ φιλοτιμίᾳ λειπόμενον, οὕτως ἐγκρατῶς καὶ\r\nσωφρόνως [D] τῷ πατρὶ καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς προσενηνέχθαι. παρασχούσης γὰρ τῆς\r\nτύχης τὸν καιρὸν, ἐν ᾧ τῆς ἁπάντων ἡγεμονίας ἐχρῆν μεταποιηθῆναι, πρῶτος\r\nὡρμήθης, πολλῶν ἀπαγορευόντων καὶ πρὸς τἀναντία ξυμπείθειν ἐπιχειρούντων·\r\nῥᾷστα δὲ καὶ πρὸς ἀσφάλειαν τὸν ὲν χερσὶ πόλεμον διοικησάμενος ἐλευθεροῦν\r\nἔγνως τῆς ἀρχῆς τὰ κατειλημμένα, [42] δικαιοτάτην μὲν καὶ οἵαν οὔπω\r\nπρόσθεν ἔλαβε πρόφασιν πόλεμος τῆς πρὸς ἐκείνους ἔχθρας τιθέμενος. οὐδὲ\r\nγὰρ ἐμφύλιον ἄξιον προσαγορεύειν τὸν πόλεμον, οὗ βάρβαρος ἦν ἡγεμὼν ἑαυτὸν\r\nἀναγορεύσας βασιλέα καὶ χειροτονήσας στρατηγόν. τῶν ἀδικημάτων δὲ τῶν\r\nἐκείνου καὶ ὧν ἔδρασεν εἰς οἰκίαν τὴν σὴν οὐχ ἡδύ μοι πολλάκις μεμνῆσθαι.\r\nἀνδρειοτέραν δὲ τ῀εσδε τῆς πράξεως τίς ἂν εἰπεῖν ἔχοι; ἐφ᾽ ἧς δῆλος μὲν\r\n[B] ἦν ἀποτυχόντι τῶν ἔργων ὁ(193) κίνδυνος· ὑπέμενες δὲ οὐδὲν κέρδους\r\nχάριν οὐδὲ κλέος ἀείμνηστον ἀντωνούμενος, ὑπὲρ οὗ καὶ ἀποθνήσκειν ἄνδρες\r\nἀγαθοὶ πολλάκις τολμῶσιν, οἷον πρὸς ἀργύριον τὴν δόξαν τὰς ψυχὰς\r\nἀποδιδόμενοι, οὐδὲ μὴν δι᾽ ἐπιθυμίαν ἀρχῆς μείζονος καὶ λαμπροτέρας, ὅτι\r\nμηδὲ νέῳ σοι τούτων ἐπιθυμῆσαι συνέβη, ἀλλ᾽ αὐτὸ τὸ καλὸν στέργων τῆς\r\nπράξεως πάντα ὑπομένειν ᾤου δεῖν πρὶν ἰδεῖν Ῥωμαίων βάρβαρον βασιλεύοντα\r\nκαὶ νόμων κύριον καὶ [C] πολιτείας καθεστῶτα καὶ τὰς ὑπὲρ τῶν κοινῶν εὐχὰς\r\nποιούμενον τὸν τοσούτοις ἀσεβήμασιν ἔνοχον καὶ φόνοις. τῆς παρασκευῆς δὲ\r\nαὐτῆς ἡ λαμπρότης καὶ τῶν ἀναλωμάτων τὸ μέγεθος τίνα οὐχ ἱκανὸν ἐκπλῆξαι;\r\nκαίτον Ξέρξην μὲν ἀκούω τὸν τὴν Ἀσίαν ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἕλληνας ἐξαναστήσαντα\r\nχρόνον ἐτῶν οὐκ ἐλάσσονα δέκα πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον ἐκεῖνον παρασκευάζεσθαι,\r\nεἶτα ἐπαγαγεῖν πρὸς ταῖς χιλίαις τριήρεσι διακοσίας ἐκ τούτων αὐτῶν οἶμαι\r\nτῶν χωρίων, [D] ἐξ ὧν αὐτὸς ἐν οὐδὲ ὅλοις μησὶ δέκα ναυπηγησάμενος ἤγειρας\r\nτὸν στόλον, πλήθει νεῶν ἐκεῖνον ὑπερβαλλόμενος· τῇ τύχῃ δὲ οὐδὲ ἄξιον\r\nσυμβαλεῖν οὐδὲ τοῖς ἔργοις.\r\n\r\n(The time has now come when it is proper to consider whether your career,\r\nso far as I have described it, is at every point in harmony with virtue\r\nand the promptings of a noble disposition. For to this, as I said at the\r\nbeginning of my speech, I think it right to pay special attention. Let me\r\ntherefore mention once more what I said some time ago, that to your father\r\nyou were dutiful and affectionate, and that you constantly maintained\r\nfriendly relations with your brothers, for your father you were ever\r\nwilling to obey, and as the colleague of your brothers in the empire you\r\nalways displayed moderation. And if anyone thinks this a trifling proof of\r\nmerit, let him consider the case of Alexander the son of Philip, and Cyrus\r\nthe son of Cambyses, and then let him applaud your conduct. For Alexander,\r\nwhile still a mere boy, showed clearly that he would no longer brook his\r\nfather’s control, while Cyrus dethroned his grandfather. Yet no one is so\r\nfoolish as to suppose that, since you displayed such modesty and self‐\r\ncontrol towards your father and brothers, you were not fully equal to\r\nAlexander and Cyrus in greatness of soul and ambition for glory. For when\r\nfortune offered you the opportunity to claim as your right the empire of\r\nthe world, you were the first to make the essay, though there were many\r\nwho advised otherwise and tried to persuade you to the contrary course.\r\nAccordingly, when you had carried through the war that you had in hand,\r\nand that with the utmost ease and so as to ensure safety for the future,\r\nyou resolved to liberate that part of the empire which had been occupied\r\nby the enemy, and the reason that you assigned for going to war was most\r\njust and such as had never before arisen, namely your detestation of those\r\ninfamous men. Civil war one could not call it, for its leader was a\r\nbarbarian who had proclaimed himself emperor and elected himself general.\r\nI dislike to speak too often of his evil deeds and the crimes that he\r\ncommitted against your house. But could anything be more heroic than your\r\nline of action? For should you fail in your undertaking the risk involved\r\nwas obvious. But you faced it, and you were not bidding for gain, nay nor\r\nfor undying renown, for whose sake brave men so often dare even to die,\r\nselling their lives for glory as though it were gold, nor was it from\r\ndesire of wider or more brilliant empire, for not even in your youth were\r\nyou ambitious of that, but it was because you were in love with the\r\nabstract beauty of such an achievement, and thought it your duty to endure\r\nanything rather than see a barbarian ruling over Roman citizens, making\r\nhimself master of the laws and constitution and offering public prayers\r\nfor the common weal, guilty as he was of so many impious crimes and\r\nmurders. Who could fail to be dazzled by the splendour of your armament\r\nand the vast scale of your expenditure? And yet I am told that Xerxes,\r\nwhen he mustered all Asia against the Greeks, spent no less than ten years\r\nin preparing for that war. Then he set out with twelve hundred triremes,\r\nfrom the very spot, as I understand, where you gathered your fleet\r\ntogether, having built it in rather less than ten months, and yet you had\r\nmore ships than Xerxes. But neither his fortune nor his achievements can\r\nproperly be compared with yours.)\r\n\r\nΤὴν δὲ εἰς τὰ λοιπὰ δαπανήματα μεγαλοπρέπειαν μὴ πολὺ λίαν ἔργον ᾖ\r\nφράζειν, οὐδὲ ὁπόσα ταῖς πόλεσι πάλαι στερομέναις ἀπεδίδους ἀπαριθμούμενος\r\nἐνοχλήσω τὰ νῦν.

For\r\nwhereas, in the time of your predecessors, they lacked the necessaries of\r\nlife, they have all become rich through you, and the general prosperity of\r\neach city increases the welfare of every private household in it. But it\r\nis proper that I should mention your gifts to private persons, and give\r\nyou the title of a generous and open‐handed Emperor; for since there were\r\nmany who long ago had lost their property, because, in some cases justly,\r\nin others unjustly, their ancestral estates had suffered loss, you had no\r\nsooner come into power, than like a just judge you set right in the latter\r\ncases the errors committed by men in the past, and restored them to the\r\ncontrol of their property, while in the former cases you were a kindly\r\narbiter, and granted that they should recover what they had lost, thinking\r\nthat to have suffered so long was punishment enough. Then you lavished\r\nlarge sums from your privy purse, and increased the reputation for wealth\r\nof many who even in the past had prided themselves on their large incomes.\r\nBut why should I remind you of all this and seem to waste time over\r\ntrifles? Especially as it must be obvious to all that no king except\r\nAlexander the son of Philip was ever known to bestow such splendid\r\npresents on his friends. Indeed some kings have thought that the wealth of\r\ntheir friends gave more grounds for suspicion and alarm than did the\r\nresources of their enemies, while others were jealous of the aristocrats\r\namong their subjects, and therefore persecuted the well‐born in every\r\npossible way, or even exterminated their houses, and thus were responsible\r\nfor the public disasters of their cities and, in private life, for the\r\nmost infamous crimes. There were some who went so far as to envy mere\r\nphysical advantages, such as health or good looks, or good condition. And\r\nas for a virtuous character among their subjects, they could not bear even\r\nto hear of it, but counted it a crime like murder or theft or treason to\r\nappear to lay claim to virtue. But perhaps someone will say, and with\r\ntruth, that these were the actions and practices not of genuine kings but\r\nof base and contemptible tyrants. Nay, but that other malady which has\r\nbeen known to attack not only those who were irrational, but some even who\r\nwere just and mild, I mean the tendency to quarrel with friends who were\r\ntoo prosperous and to wish to humble them and deprive them of their\r\nrightful possessions, who I ask has ever dared so much as to mention such\r\nconduct in your case? Yet such, they say, was the treatment that Cyrus the\r\nPersian, the king’s son‐in‐law, received from his kinsman,(196) who could\r\nnot brook the honour in which Cyrus was held by the common people, and\r\nAgesilaus also is well known to have resented the honours paid to Lysander\r\nby the Ionians.)\r\n\r\nΤούτους οὖν(197) πάντας ὑπερβαλλόμενος ἀρετῇ, τοῖς πλουτοῦσι μὲν τὸ\r\nπλουτεῖν ἀσφαλέστερον ἢ πατὴρ τοῖς αὑτοῦ παισί κατέστησας, εὐγενείας δὲ\r\nτῆς τῶν ὑπηκόων προνοεῖς καθάπερ ἁπάσης πόλεως οἰκιστὴς καὶ νομοθέτης· καὶ\r\nτοὶς ἐκ τῆς τύχης ἀγαθοῖς πολλὰ μὲν προστιθείς, πολλὰ δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξ\r\nἀρχῆς χαριζόμενος, δῆλος [C] εἶ τῷ μεγέθει μὲν τὰς παρὰ τῶν βασιλέων\r\nδωρεὰς ὑπερβαλλόμενος, τῇ βεβαιότητι δὲ τῶν ἅπαξ δοθέντων τὰς παρὰ τῶν\r\nδήμων χάριτας ἁποκρυπτόμενος. τοῦτο δὲ οἶμαι καὶ μάλα εἰκότως συμβαίνει.\r\nοἱ μὲν γὰρ ἐφ᾽ οἷς συνίσασιν αὑτοῖς ἀπολειφθεῖσιν ἀγαθοῖς, τοῖς\r\nκεκτημένοις βασκαίνουσιν, ὅτῳ δὲ τὰ μὲν ἐκ τῆς τύχης ἐστὶ λαμπρὰ καὶ οἷα\r\nοὐδενὶ τῶν ἄλλων, τὰ δὲ ἐκ τῆς προαιρέσεως τῶν ἐκ τῆς τύχης μακρῷ\r\nσεμνότερα, οὐκ ἔστιν ὅτου δεόμενος τῷ κεκτημένῳ φθονήσειεν.

[B] καὶ τῆς μὲν οὐδὲ ἐπ᾽ ὀλίγον ἀφελὼν δῆλος\r\nεἶ, τῶν πόνων δὲ οὐδὲ ἐπὶ σμικρὸν κοινωνεῖν ἀξιοῖς. πλὴν εἴ που δέοι πρὸς\r\nὀλίγον ἑπόμενον σοι στρατεύεσθαι. πότερον οὖν καὶ περὶ τούτων μαρτύρων\r\nτινῶν καὶ τεκμηρίων τῷ λόγῳ προσδεῖ; ἢ δῆλον ἐκ τοῦ λέγοντος, ὅτι μὴ\r\nψευδεῖς ἐπεισάγει λόγους; ἀλλ᾽ ὑπὲρ μὲν τούτων οὐδὲν ἔτι πλέον ἄξιον\r\nἐνδιατρίβειν.\r\n\r\n(All these, then, you have surpassed in merit, for you have made their\r\nwealth more secure for the rich than a father would for his own children,\r\nand you take thought that your subjects shall be well‐born, as though you\r\nwere the founder and law‐giver of every single city. Those to whom fortune\r\nhas been generous you still further enrich, and in many cases men owe all\r\ntheir wealth to your generosity, so that in amount your gifts clearly\r\nsurpass those of other princes, while, in security of ownership of what\r\nhas once been given, you cast into the shade any favours bestowed by\r\ndemocracies.(198) And this is, I think, very natural. For when men are\r\nconscious that they lack certain advantages, they envy those who do\r\npossess them, but when a man is more brilliantly endowed by fortune than\r\nany of his fellows, and by his own initiative has won even higher\r\ndignities than fate had assigned him, he lacks nothing, and there is none\r\nwhom he need envy. And since you realise that in your case this is\r\nespecially true, you rejoice at the good fortune of others and take\r\npleasure in the successes of your subjects. You have already bestowed on\r\nthem certain honours, and other honours you are on the point of bestowing,\r\nand you are making plans for the benefit of yet other persons. Nor are you\r\ncontent to award to your friends the government of a single city or\r\nnation, or even of many such, with the honours attaching thereto. But\r\nunless you chose a colleague(199) to share that empire on whose behalf you\r\nhad spared no pains to exterminate the brood of usurpers, you thought that\r\nno act of yours could be worthy of your former achievements. That you\r\nreached this decision not so much because it was necessary as because you\r\ntake pleasure in giving all that you have to give, is, I suppose, well\r\nknown to all. For you chose no colleague to aid you in your contests with\r\nthe usurpers, but you thought it right that one who had not shared in the\r\ntoil should share in the honour and glory, and that only when all danger\r\nseemed to be over. And it is well known that from that honour you subtract\r\nnot even a trifling part, though you do not demand that he should share\r\nthe danger even in some small degree, except indeed when it was necessary\r\nfor a short time that he should accompany you on your campaign. Does my\r\naccount of this call for any further witnesses or proofs? Surely it is\r\nobvious that he who tells the tale would not be the one to introduce a\r\nfictitious account. But on this part of my subject I must not spend any\r\nmore time.)\r\n\r\nΣωφροσύνης δὲ ὑπὲρ τῆς σῆς καὶ φρονήσεως καὶ ὅσην εὔνοιαν τοῖς ὑπηκόοις\r\nἐνειργάσω, [C] βραχέα διελθεῖν ἴσως οὐκ ἄτοπον. τίς γάρ σ᾽(200) ἀγνοεῖ τῶν\r\nἁπάντων τοσαύτην ἐκ παίδων τῆς ἀρετῆς ταύτης ἐπιμέλειαν ἐσχηκότα, ὅσην\r\nοὐδεὶς ἄλλος τῶν ἔμπροσθεν; καὶ τῆς μὲν ἐν παισὶ σωφροσύνης μάρτυς ὁ πατὴρ\r\nγέγονεν ἀξιόχρεως, σοὶ τὰ περὶ τὴς ἀρχὴν καὶ τὰ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς\r\nδιοικεῖν ἐπιτρέψας μόνῳ, ὄντι γε οὐδὲ πρεσβυτάτῳ τῶν ἐκείνου παίδων· τῆς\r\nδὲ ἐν ἀνδράσιν ἅπαντες αἰσθανόμεθα, [D] καθάπερ πολίτου τοῖς νόμοις\r\nὑπακούοντος, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ βασιλέως τῶν νόμων ἄρχοντος, ἀεί σου προσφερομένου τῷ\r\nπλήθει καὶ τοῖς ἐν τέλει. τίς γάρ σ᾽(201) ἔγνω μεῖζον ὑπὸ τῆς εὐτυχίας\r\nφρονήσαντα; τίς δὲ ἐπαρθέντα τοῖς κατορθώμασι τοσούτοις(202) καὶ\r\nτηλικούτοις ἐν βραχεῖ χρόνῳ γενομένοις; ἀλλὰ τὸν Φιλίππου φασὶν\r\nἈλέξανδρον, ἐπειδὴ τὴν Περσῶν καθεῖλε δύναμιν, οὐ μόνον τὴν ἄλλην δίαιταν\r\nπρὸς ὄγκον μείζονα καὶ λίαν ἐπαχθῆ τοῖς πᾶσιν ὑπεροψίαν μεταβαλεῖν, [46]\r\nἀλλ᾽ ἤδη καὶ τοῦ φύσαντος ὑπερορᾶν καὶ τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης ἁπάσης φύσεως. ἠξίου\r\nγὰρ υἱὸς Ἄμμωνος, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ Φιλίππου νομίζεσθαι, καὶ τῶν συστρατευσαμένων\r\nὄσοι μὴ κολακεύειν μηδὲ δουλεύειν ἠπίσταντο τῶν ἑαλωκότων πικρότερον\r\nἐκολάζοντο. ἀλλὰ σοῦ γε τῆς εἰς τὸν πατέρα τιμῆς ἆρα ἄξιον ἐνταῦθα\r\nμεμνῆσθαι; ὃν οὐκ ἰδίᾳ μόνον σεβόμενος, ἀεὶ δὲ ἐν τοῖς κοινοῖς συλλόγοις\r\nδιετέλεις ἀνακηρύττων καθάπερ ἀγαθὸν ἥρωα. τῶν φίλων δέ, [B] ἀξιοῖς γὰρ\r\nαὐτοὺς οὐκ ἄχρις ὀνόματος μόνον τῆς τιμῆς, πολὺ δὲ πλέον διὰ τῶν πραγμάτων\r\nβεβαιοῖς ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν τοὔνομα· ἔστιν οὖν ἄρα τις ὁ μεμφόμενος ἀτιμίαν ἢ\r\nζημίαν ἢ βλάβην ἤ τινα μικρὰν ὑπεροψίαν ἢ μείζονα; ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ ἂν οὐδαμῶς\r\nεἰπεῖν ἔχοι τοιοῦτον οὐδὲν. τούτων γὰρ οἱ μὲν γηραιοὶ σφόδρα, ταῖς ἀρχαῖς\r\nεἰς τὴν εἱμαρμένην τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου παραμείναντες, τὰς ἐπιμελείας τῶν\r\nκοινῶν συναπέθεντο τοῖς σώμασι, [C] παισὶν ἢ φίλοις ἤ τισι πρὸς γένους\r\nτοὺς κλήρους παραπέμποντες· ἄλλοι δὲ πρὸς τοὺς πόνους καὶ τὰς στρατείας\r\nἀπαγορεύοντες, ἀφέσεως ἐντίμου τυχόντες, ζῶσιν ὄλβιοι· τινὲς δὲ καὶ\r\nμετήλλαξαν, εὐδαίμονες παρὰ τοῦ πλήθους εἶναι κρινόμενοι. ὅλως δὲ οὐκ\r\nἔστιν οὐδὲ εἷς, ὃς ἐπειδὴ ταύτης ἠξιώθη τῆς τιμῆς, εἰ καὶ μοχθηρὸς ὕστερον\r\nἐφάνη, τιμωρίας ἔτυχε μικρᾶς ἢ μείζονος· ἤρκεσε δὲ αὐτὸν ἀπηλλάχθαι μόνον\r\nκαὶ μηδὲν ἐνοχλεῖν ἔτι.\r\n\r\n(A few words about your temperance, your wisdom, and the affection that\r\nyou inspired in your subjects, will not, I think, be out of place. For who\r\nis there among them all who does not know that from boyhood you cultivated\r\nthe virtue of temperance as no one had ever done before you? That in your\r\nyouth you possessed that virtue your father is a trustworthy witness, for\r\nhe entrusted to you alone the management of affairs of state and all that\r\nrelated to your brothers, although you were not even the eldest of his\r\nsons. And that you still display it, now that you are a man, we are all\r\nwell aware, since you ever behave towards the people and the magistrates\r\nlike a citizen who obeys the laws, not like a king who is above the laws.\r\nFor who ever saw you made arrogant by prosperity? Who ever saw you\r\nuplifted by those successes, so numerous and so splendid, and so quickly\r\nachieved? They say that Alexander, Philip’s son, when he had broken the\r\npower of Persia, not only adopted a more ostentatious mode of life and an\r\ninsolence of manner obnoxious to all, but went so far as to despise the\r\nfather that begat him, and indeed the whole human race. For he claimed to\r\nbe regarded as the son of Ammon instead of the son of Philip, and when\r\nsome of those who had taken part in his campaigns could not learn to\r\nflatter him or to be servile, he punished them more harshly than the\r\nprisoners of war. But the honour that you paid to your father need I speak\r\nof in this place? Not only did you revere him in private life, but\r\nconstantly, where men were gathered together in public, you sang his\r\npraises as though he were a beneficent hero‐god. And as for your friends,\r\nyou grant them that honour not merely in name, but by your actions you\r\nmake their title sure. Can any one of them, I ask, lay to your charge the\r\nloss of any right, or any penalty or injury suffered, or any overbearing\r\nact either serious or trifling? Nay there is not one who could bring any\r\nsuch accusation. For your friends who were far advanced in years remained\r\nin office till the appointed end of their lives, and only laid down with\r\nlife itself their control of public business, and then they handed on\r\ntheir possessions to their children or friends or some member of their\r\nfamily. Others again, when their strength failed for work or military\r\nservice, received an honourable discharge, and are now spending their last\r\ndays in prosperity; yet others have departed this life, and the people\r\ncall them blessed. In short there is no man who having once been held\r\nworthy of the honour of your friendship, ever suffered any punishment\r\ngreat or small, even though later he proved to be vicious. For them all\r\nthat he had to do was to depart and give no further trouble.)\r\n\r\n[D] Ἐν δὲ τούτοις ἅπασιν ὢν καὶ γεγονὼς τοιοῦτος ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἡδονῆς ἁπάσης, ᾗ\r\nπρόσεστιν ὄνειδος καὶ μικρόν, καθαρὰν τὴν ψυχὴν διεφύλαξας. μόνον δὲ οἶμαι\r\nσὲ τῶν πρόσθεν αὐτοκρατόρων, σχεδὸν δὲ πλὴν σφόδρα ὀλίγων καὶ πάντων\r\nἀνθρώπων οὐκ ἀνδράσι μόνον παράδειγμα πρὸς σωφροσύνην παρασχεῖν κάλλιστον,\r\nκαὶ γυναιξὶ δὲ τῆς πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας κοινωνίας.

Your actions, however, are more convincing, I\r\nthink, than my words. For it is not likely that this great and mighty\r\nempire would have attained such dimensions or achieved such splendid\r\nresults, had it not been directed and governed by an intelligence to\r\nmatch. Indeed, when it is entrusted to luck alone, unaided by wisdom, we\r\nmay be thankful if it last for any length of time. It is easy by depending\r\non luck to flourish for a brief space, but without the aid of wisdom it is\r\nvery hard, or rather I might say impossible, to preserve the blessings\r\nthat have been bestowed. And, in short, if we need cite a convincing proof\r\nof this, we do not lack many notable instances. For by wise counsel we\r\nmean the ability to discover most successfully the measures that will be\r\ngood and expedient when put into practice. It is therefore proper to\r\nconsider in every case whether this wise counsel may not be counted as one\r\nof the things you have achieved. Certainly when there was need of harmony\r\nyou gladly gave way, and when it was your duty to aid the community as a\r\nwhole you declared for war with the utmost readiness. And when you had\r\ndefeated the forces of Persia without losing a single hoplite, you made\r\ntwo separate campaigns against the usurpers, and after overcoming one of\r\nthem(208) by your public harangue, you added to your army his forces,\r\nwhich were fresh and had suffered no losses, and finally, by intelligence\r\nrather than by brute force, you completely subdued the other usurper who\r\nhad inflicted so many sufferings on the community. I now desire to speak\r\nmore clearly on this subject and to demonstrate to all what it was that\r\nyou chiefly relied on and that secured you from failure in every one of\r\nthose great enterprises to which you devoted yourself. It is your\r\nconviction that the affection of his subjects is the surest defence of an\r\nemperor. Now it is the height of absurdity to try to win that affection by\r\ngiving orders, and levying it as though it were a tax or tribute. The only\r\nalternative is the policy that you have yourself pursued, I mean of doing\r\ngood to all men and imitating the divine nature on earth. To show mercy\r\neven in anger, to take away their harshness from acts of vengeance, to\r\ndisplay kindness and toleration to your fallen enemies, this was your\r\npractice, this you always commended and enjoined on others to imitate, and\r\nthus, even while the usurper still controlled Italy, you transferred Rome\r\nto Paeonia by means of the Senate and inspired the cities with zeal for\r\nundertaking public services.)\r\n\r\nΤῶν στρατευμάτων δὲ τὴν εὔνοιαν τίς ἂν ἀξίως διηγήσαιτο; τάξις μὲν ἱππέων\r\nπρὸ τῆς ἐν τῇ Μύρσῃ παρατάξεως μεθειστήκει, [C] ἐπεὶ δὲ τῆς Ἰταλίας\r\nἐκράτησας, πεζῶν κατάλογοι καὶ τέλη λαμπρά. ἀλλὰ τὸ μικρὸν μετὰ τὴν τοῦ\r\nτυράννου δυστυχῆ τελευτὴν ἐν Γαλατίᾳ γενόμενον κοινὴν ἁπάντων ἔδειξε\r\nστρατοπέδων τὴν εὔνοιαν, τὸν θρασυνόμενον καθάπερ ἐπ᾽ ἐρημίας καὶ τὴν\r\nγυναικείαν ἁλουργίδα περιβαλόμενον ὥσπερ τινὰ λύκον(209) ἐξαίφνης\r\nδιασπασαμένων. ὅστις δὲ ἐπὶ ταύτῃ γέγονας τῇ πράξει, καὶ ὅπως πρᾴως ἅπασι\r\nκαὶ φιλανθρώπως τοῖς ἐκείνου γνωρίμοις προσηνέχθης, ὅσοι μηδὲν ἠλέγχοντο\r\nἐκείνῳ συμπράξαντες, πολλῶν ἐφεστηκότων τῇ κατηγορίᾳ συκοφαντῶν, [D] καὶ\r\nτὴν πρὸς ἐκεῖνον φιλίαν ὑποπτεύειν μόνον κελευόντων, ἐγὼ μὲν ἁπάσης ἀρετῆς\r\nτίθεμαι τοῦτο(210) κεφάλαιον. καὶ γὰρ ἐπιεικῶς καὶ δικαίως φημὶ καὶ πολὺ\r\nπλέον ἐμφρόνως πεπράχθαι. ὅστις δὲ ἄλλως ἡγεῖται καὶ τῆς περὶ τοῦ\r\nπράγματος ἀληθοῦς ὑπολήψεως καὶ τῆς σῆς γνώμης διήμαρτε. τοὺς μὲν γὰρ οὐκ\r\nἐλεγχθέντας δίκαιον ἦν, ὡς εἰκός, [49] σώζεσθαι, ὑπόπτους δὲ τὰς φιλίας\r\nκαὶ διὰ τοῦτο φευκτὰς οὐδαμῶς ᾤου δεῖν κατασκευάζειν, ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν ὑπηκόων\r\nεὐνοίας ἐς τοῦτο μεγέθους ἀρθεὶς καὶ πράξεων. ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸν παῖδα τοῦ\r\nτετολμηκότος νήπιον κομιδῇ τῆς πατρῴας οὐδὲν εἴασας μετασχεῖν ζημίας. οὕτω\r\nσοι πρὸς ἐπιείκειαν ἡ πρᾶξις ῥέπουσα τελείας ἀρετῆς ὑπάρχει γνώρισμα. * *\r\n*\r\n\r\n(As for the affection of your armies, what description could do it\r\njustice? Even before the battle at Myrsa, a division of cavalry came over\r\nto your side,(211) and when you had conquered Italy bodies of infantry and\r\ndistinguished legions did the same. But what happened in Galatia(212)\r\nshortly after the usurper’s miserable end demonstrated the universal\r\nloyalty of the garrisons to you; for when, emboldened by his isolated\r\nposition, another(213) dared to assume the effeminate purple, they\r\nsuddenly set on him as though he were a wolf and tore him limb from\r\nlimb.(214) Your behaviour after that deed, your merciful and humane\r\ntreatment of all those of his friends who were not convicted of having\r\nshared his crimes, and that in spite of all the sycophants who came\r\nforward with accusations and warned you to show only suspicion against\r\nfriends of his, this I count as the culmination of all virtue. What is\r\nmore, I maintain that your conduct was not only humane and just, but\r\nprudent in a still higher degree. He who thinks otherwise falls short of a\r\ntrue understanding of both the circumstances and your policy. For that\r\nthose who had not been proved guilty should be protected was of course\r\njust, and you thought you ought by no means to make friendship a reason\r\nfor suspicion and so cause it to be shunned, seeing that it was due to the\r\nloyal affection of your own subjects that you had attained to such power\r\nand accomplished so much. But the son of that rash usurper, who was a mere\r\nchild, you did not allow to share his father’s punishment.

In his detailed and forced analogies of the\r\nachievements of Constantius with those of the Homeric heroes, always to\r\nthe advantage of the former, Julian follows a sophistic practice that he\r\nhimself condemns,(217) and though he more than once contrasts himself with\r\nthe “ingenious rhetoricians” he is careful to observe all their rules,\r\neven in his historical descriptions of the Emperor’s campaigns. The long\r\nPlatonic digression on Virtue and the ideal ruler is a regular feature of\r\na panegyric of this type, though Julian neglects to make the direct\r\napplication to Constantius. In the First Oration he quoted Homer only\r\nonce, but while the Second contains the usual comparisons with the Persian\r\nmonarchs and Alexander, its main object is to prove, by direct references\r\nto the Iliad, that Constantius surpassed Nestor in strategy, Odysseus in\r\neloquence, and in courage Hector, Sarpedon and Achilles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΚΑΙΣΑΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Caesar)\r\n\r\nΠΕΡΙ ΤΩΝ ΤΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ ΠΡΑΞΕΩΝ Η ΠΕΡΙ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑΣ.\r\n\r\n(The Heroic Deeds of the Emperor Constantius, Or, On Kingship)\r\n\r\nΤὸν Ἀχιλλέα φησὶν ἡ ποίησις, ὁπότε ἐμήνισε καὶ διηνέχθη πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα,\r\nμεθεῖναι μὲν ταῖν χεροῖν τὴν αἰχμὴν καὶ τὴν ἀσπίδα, ψαλτήριον δὲ\r\nἁρμοσάμενον καὶ κιθάραν ᾄδειν καὶ ὑμνεῖν τῶν ἡμιθέων τὰς πράξεις, καὶ\r\nταύτην διαγωγὴν τῆς ἡσυχίας ποιεῖσθαι, εὖ μάλα ἐμφρόνως τοῦτο διανοηθέντα.\r\n[D] τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἀπεχθάνεσθαι καὶ παροξύνειν τὸν βασιλέα λίαν αὔθαδες καὶ\r\nἄγριον· τυχὸν δὲ οὐδὲ ἐκείνης ἀπολύεται τῆς μέμψεως ὁ τῆς Θέτιδος, ὅτι τῷι\r\nκαιρῷ τῶν ἔργων εἰς ᾠδὰς καταχρῆται καὶ κρούματα, ἐξὸν τότε μὲν ἔχεσθαι\r\nτῶν ὅπλων καὶ μὴ μεθιέναι, αὖθις δὲ ἐφ᾽ ἡσυχίας ὑμνεῖν τὸν βασιλέα καὶ\r\nᾄδειν τὰ κατορθώματα.

For to fall out with the king and affront him was\r\nexcessively rash and violent. But perhaps the son of Thetis is not free\r\nfrom this criticism either, that he spent in song and music the hours that\r\ncalled for deeds, though at such a time he might have retained his arms\r\nand not laid them aside, but later, at his leisure, he could have sung the\r\npraises of the king and chanted his victories. Though indeed the author of\r\nthat tale tells us that Agamemnon also did not behave to his general\r\neither temperately or with tact, but first used threats and proceeded to\r\ninsolent acts, when he robbed Achilles of his prize of valour. Then Homer\r\nbrings them, penitent now, face to face in the assembly, and makes the son\r\nof Thetis exclaim)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἀτρείδη, ἦ ἄρ τι τόδ᾽ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἄρειον\r\n    Ἔπλετο, σοὶ καὶ ἐμοί,\r\n\r\n    (“Son of Atreus, verily it had been better on this wise for both\r\n    thee and me!”(219))\r\n\r\n\r\n[B] εἶτα ἐπαρώμενον τῇ προφάσει τῇ ἀπεχθείας καὶ ἀπαριθμούμενον τὰς ἐκ τῆς\r\nμήνιδος ξυμφοράς, τὸν βασιλέα δὲ αἰτιώμενον Δία καὶ Μοῖραν(220) καὶ\r\nἘρινύν, δοκεῖ μοι διδάσκειν, ὥσπερ ἐν δράματι τοῖς προκειμένοις ἀνδράσιν\r\nοἷον εἰκόσι χρώμενος, ὅτι χρὴ τοὺς μὲν βασιλέας μηδὲν ὕβρει πράττειν μηδὲ\r\nτῇ δυνάμει πρὸς ἅπαν χρῆσθαι μηδὲ ἐφιέναι τῷ θυμῷ, καθάπερ ἵππῳ θρασεῖ\r\nχήτει χαλινοῦ καὶ ἡνιόχου φερομένῳ, παραινεῖν δὲ αὖ τοῖς [C] στρατηγοῖς\r\nὑπεροψίαν βασιλικὴν μὴ δυσχεραίνειν, φέρειν δὲ ἐγκρατῶς καὶ πρᾴως τὰς\r\nἐπιτιμήσεις, ἵνα μὴ μεταμελείας αὐτοῖς ὁ βίος μεστὸς ᾖ.\r\n\r\n(Later on he makes him curse the cause of their quarrel, and recount the\r\ndisasters due to his own wrath, and we see the king blaming Zeus and Fate\r\nand Erinys. And here, I think, he is pointing a moral, using those heroes\r\nwhom he sets before us, like types in a tragedy, and the moral is that\r\nkings ought never to behave insolently, nor use their power without\r\nreserve, nor be carried away by their anger like a spirited horse that\r\nruns away for lack of the bit and the driver; and then again he is warning\r\ngenerals not to resent the insolence of kings but to endure their censure\r\nwith self‐control and serenely, so that their whole life may not be filled\r\nwith remorse.(221))\r\n\r\nΤαῦτα κατ᾽ ἐμαυτὸν ἐννοῶν, ὦ φίλε βασιλεῦ, καὶ σὲ μὲν ὁρῶν ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων\r\nτὴν Ὁμηρικὴν παιδείαν ἐπιδεικνύμενον καὶ ἐθέλοντα πάντως κοινῇ μὲν(222)\r\nἅπαντας ἀγαθόν τι δρᾶν, ἡμῖν δὲ ἰδίᾳ τιμὰς καὶ γέρα ἄλλα ἐπ᾽ ἄλλοις\r\nπαρασκευάζοντα, τοσούτῳ δὲ οἶμαι κρείττονα τοῦ τῶν Ἐλλήνων βασιλέως εἶναι\r\nἐθέλοντα, ὥστε ὁ μὲν ἠτίμαζε τοὺς ἀρίστους, σὺ δὲ οἶμαι καὶ τῶν φαύλων\r\nπολλοῖς τὴν συγγνώμην νέμεις, τὸν Πιττακὸν ἐπαινῶν τοῦ λόγου, ὃς τὴν\r\nσυγγνώμην τῆς τιμωρίας προυτίθει, [D] αἰσχυνοίμην ἄν, εἰ μὴ τοῦ Πηλέως\r\nφαινοίμην εὐγνωμονέστερος μηδὲ(223) ἐπαινοίην εἰς δύναμιν τὰ προσόντα σοί,\r\nοὔτι φημὶ χρυσὸν καὶ ἁλουργῆ χλαῖναν, οὐδὲ μὰ Δία πέπλους παμποικίλους,\r\nγυναικῶν ἔργα Σιδωνίων, οὐδὲ ἵππων Νισαίων κάλλη καὶ χρυσοκολλήτων ἁρμάτων\r\nἀστράπτουσαν αἴγλην, [51] οὐδὲ τὴν Ἰνδῶν λίθον εὐανθῆ καὶ χαρίεσσαν.\r\nκαίτοι γε εἴ τις ἐθέλοι τούτοις τὸν νοῦν προσέχων ἕκαστον ἀξιοῦν λόγου,\r\nμικροῦ πᾶσαν οἶμαι τὴν Ὁμήρου ποίησιν ἀποχετεύσας ἔτι δεήσεται λόγων, καὶ\r\nοὐκ ἀποχρήσει σοὶ μόνῳ τὰ ξύμπασι ποιηθέντα τοῖς ἡμιθέιος ἐγκώμια.\r\nἀρξώμεθα δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ σκήπτρου πρῶτον, εἰ βούλει, καὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτῆς·\r\n[B] τί γὰρ δή φησιν ὁ ποιητὴς ἐπαινεῖν ἐθέλων τῆς τῶν Πελοπιδῶν οἰκίας τὴν\r\nἀρχαιότητα καὶ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς ἡγεμονίας ἐνδείξασθαι;\r\n\r\n(When I reflect on this, my beloved Emperor, and behold you displaying in\r\nall that you do the result of your study of Homer, and see you so eager to\r\nbenefit every citizen in the community in every way, and devising for me\r\nindividually such honours and privileges one after another, then I think\r\nthat you desire to be nobler than the king of the Greeks, to such a\r\ndegree, that, whereas he insulted his bravest men, you, I believe, grant\r\nforgiveness to many even of the undeserving, since you approve the maxim\r\nof Pittacus which set mercy before vengeance. And so I should be ashamed\r\nnot to appear more reasonable than the son of Peleus, or to fail to\r\npraise, as far as in me lies, what appertains to you, I do not mean gold,\r\nor a robe of purple, nay by Zeus, nor raiment embroidered all over, the\r\nwork of Sidonian women,(224) nor beautiful Nisaean horses,(225) nor the\r\ngleam and glitter of gold‐mounted chariots, nor the precious stone of\r\nIndia, so beautiful and lovely to look upon. And yet if one should choose\r\nto devote his attention to these and think fit to describe every one of\r\nthem, he would have to draw on almost the whole stream of Homer’s poetry\r\nand still he would be short of words, and the panegyrics that have been\r\ncomposed for all the demi‐gods would be inadequate for your sole praise.\r\nFirst, then, let me begin, if you please, with your sceptre and your\r\nsovereignty itself.

These, then, are the distinctions\r\nthat they won. Your father inherited his proper share of the Empire with\r\nall piety and due observance, waiting till his father reached his\r\nappointed end. Then he freed from intolerable slavery the remainder, which\r\nhad sunk from empire to tyranny, and so governed the whole, appointing you\r\nand your brothers, his three sons, as his colleagues. Now can I fairly\r\ncompare your house with the Pelopids in the extent of their power, the\r\nlength of their dynasty, or the number of those who sat on the throne? Or\r\nis that really foolish, and must I instead go on to describe your wealth,\r\nand admire your cloak and the brooch that fastens it, the sort of thing on\r\nwhich even Homer loved to linger? Or must I describe at length the mares\r\nof Tros that numbered three thousand, and)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ἕλος κάτα βουκολέοντο, [C]\r\n\r\n    (“pastured in the marsh‐meadow”)(235)\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ τὰ φώρια τὰ ἐντεῦθεν; ἢ τοὺς Θρᾳκίους ἵππους εὐλαβησόμεθα λευκοτέρους\r\nμὲν τῆς χιόνος, θεῖν δὲ ὠκυτέρους τῶν χειμερίων πνευμάτων, καὶ τὰ ἐν\r\nαὐτοῖς ἅρματα; καὶ ἔχομέν σε ἐν τούτοις ἐπαινεῖν, οἰκίαν τε οἶμαι τὴν\r\nἈλκίνου καὶ τὰ τοῦ Μενέλεω δώματα καταπληξάμενα καὶ τὸν τοῦ πολύφρονος\r\nὈδυσσέως παῖδα καὶ τοιαῦτα ληρεῖν ἀναπείσαντα τοῖς σοῖς παραβαλεῖν\r\nἀξιώσομεν, [D] μὴ ποτε ἄρα ἔλασσον ἔχειν ἐν τούτοις δοκῇς, καὶ οὐκ\r\nἀπωσόμεθα τὴν φλυαρίαν; ἀλλ᾽ ὅρα μή τις ἡμᾶς μικρολογίας καὶ ἀμαθίας τῶν\r\nἀληθῶς καλῶν γραψάμενος ἕλῃ. οὐκοῦν ἀφέντας χρὴ τοῖς Ὁμηρίδαις τὰ τοιαῦτα\r\nπολυπραγμονεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ τούτων ἐγγυτέρω πρὸς ἀρετήν, καὶ ὧν μείζονα ποιεῖ\r\nπρομήθειαν, σώματος ῥώμης καὶ τῆς ἐν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἐμπειρίας,\r\nθαρροῦντας(236) ἰέναι.\r\n\r\n(and the theft that followed?(237) Or shall I pay my respects to your\r\nThracian horses, whiter than snow and faster than the storm winds, and\r\nyour Thracian chariots?

Nay, I must be on my guard lest\r\nsomeone accuse and convict me of using frivolous speech and ignoring what\r\nis really admirable.

And as for their\r\nfastest runner, it is an open question how he compares with you. But in\r\ndrawing up troops and forming a phalanx skilfully Menestheus(243) seems to\r\nhave excelled, and on account of his greater age the Pylian(244) is his\r\nequal in proficiency. But the enemy often threw their line into disorder,\r\nand not even at the wall(245) could they hold their ground when they\r\nencountered the foe. You, however, engaged in countless battles, not only\r\nwith hostile barbarians in great numbers, but with just as many of your\r\nown subjects, who had revolted and were fighting on the side of one who\r\nwas ambitious of grasping the imperial power; yet your phalanx remained\r\nunbroken and never wavered or yielded an inch. That this is not an idle\r\nboast and that I do not make a pretension in words that goes beyond the\r\nactual facts, I will demonstrate to my hearers. For I think it would be\r\nabsurd to relate to you your own achievements. I should be like a stupid\r\nand tasteless person who, on seeing the works of Pheidias should attempt\r\nto discuss with Pheidias himself the Maiden Goddess on the Acropolis, or\r\nthe statue of Zeus at Pisa.

For your triumphs really call for\r\nthe trumpet of Homer himself, far more than did the achievements of the\r\nMacedonian.(247) This will be evident as I go on to use the same method of\r\nargument which I adopted when I began. It then became evident that there\r\nis a strong affinity between the Emperor’s exploits and those of the\r\nheroes, and I claimed that while one hero excelled the others in one\r\naccomplishment only, the Emperor excels them all in all those\r\naccomplishments. That he is more kingly than the king himself(248) I\r\nproved, if you remember, in what I said in my introduction, and again and\r\nagain it will be evident. But now let us, if you please, consider his\r\nbattles and campaigns. What Greeks and barbarians did Homer praise above\r\ntheir fellows? I will read you those of his verses that are most to the\r\npoint.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    [55] Τίς τ᾽ ἂρ τῶν ὄχ᾽ ἄριστος ἔην, σύ μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα,\r\n    Ἀνδρῶν ἠδ᾽ ἵππων, οἳ ἃμ᾽ Ἀτρείδαισιν ἕποντο.\r\n    Ἀνδρῶν μὲν μέγ᾽ ἄριστος ἔην Τελαμώνιος Αἴας,\r\n    Ὄφρ᾽ Ἀχιλεὺς μήνιεν· ὁ γὰρ πολὺ φέρτατος ἦεν.\r\n\r\n    (“Tell me, Muse, who was foremost of those warriors and horses\r\n    that followed the sons of Atreus.

And, in fact, the fighting of Achilles at the river resembles\r\nin some respects certain of the Emperor’s achievements, and so does the\r\nbattle of the Achaeans about the wall. Or Ajax again, when, in his\r\nstruggle to defend the ships, he goes up on to their decks, might be\r\nallowed some just resemblance to him. But now I wish to describe to you\r\nthe battle by the river which the Emperor fought not long ago.

Even so the usurper thought that he had left behind\r\nhim nothing hostile or opposed to him, and that there was nothing at all\r\nto hinder him from taking up a position at the mouth of the Tigris. And\r\nthere followed him a large force of heavy infantry and as many cavalry,\r\nyes, and good fighters they were, Celts, Iberians and Germans from the\r\nbanks of the Rhine and from the coasts of the western sea. Whether I ought\r\nto call that sea the Ocean or the Atlantic, or whether it is proper to use\r\nsome other name for it, I am not sure. I only know that its coasts are\r\npeopled by tribes of barbarians who are not easy to subdue and are far\r\nmore energetic than any other race, and I know it not merely from hearsay,\r\non which it is never safe to rely, but I have learned it from personal\r\nexperience. From these tribes, then, he mustered an army as large as that\r\nwhich marched with him from home, or rather many followed him because they\r\nwere his own people, allied to him by the ties of race, but our\r\nsubjects—for so we must call them—I mean all his Roman troops followed\r\nfrom compulsion and not from choice, like mercenary allies, and their\r\nposition and _rôle_ was like that of the proverbial Carian,(259) since\r\nthey were naturally ill‐disposed to a barbarian and a stranger who had\r\nconceived the idea of ruling and embarked on the enterprise at the time of\r\na drunken debauch, and was the sort of leader that one might expect from\r\nsuch a preface and prelude as that. He led them in person, not indeed like\r\nTypho, who, as the poet tells us,(260) in his wonder tale, was brought\r\nforth by the earth in her anger against Zeus, nor was he like the\r\nstrongest of the Giants, but he was like that Vice incarnate which the\r\nwise Prodicus created in his fable,(261) making her compete with Virtue\r\nand attempt to win over the son of Zeus,(262) contending that he would do\r\nwell to prize her above all else. And as he led them to battle he outdid\r\nthe behaviour of Capaneus,(263) like the barbarian that he was, in his\r\ninsensate folly, though he did not, like Capaneus, trust to the energy of\r\nhis soul or his physical strength, but to the numbers of his barbarian\r\nfollowers; and he boasted that he would lay everything at their feet to\r\nplunder, that every general and captain and common soldier of his should\r\ndespoil an enemy of corresponding rank of his baggage and belongings, and\r\nthat he would enslave the owners as well. He was confirmed in this\r\nattitude by the Emperor’s clever strategy, and led his army out from the\r\nnarrow passes to the plains in high spirits and little knowing the truth,\r\nsince he decided that the Emperor’s march was merely flight and not a\r\nmanoeuvre. Thus he was taken unawares, like a bird or fish in the net. For\r\nwhen he reached the open country and the plains of Paeonia, and it seemed\r\nadvantageous to fight it out there, then and not before the Emperor drew\r\nup his cavalry separately on both wings.)\r\n\r\nΤούτων δὲ οἱ μέν εἰσιν αἰχμοφόροι, θώραξιν ἐλατοῖς καὶ κράνεσιν ἐκ σιδήρου\r\nπεποιημένοις σκεπόμενοι· [C] κνημῖδές τε τοῖς σφυροῖς εὖ μάλα\r\nπεριηρμοσμέναι καὶ περιγονατίδες καὶ περὶ τοὶς μηροῖς ἕτερα τοιαῦτα ἐκ\r\nσιδήρου καλύμματα· αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀτεχνῶς ὥσπερ ἀνδριάντες ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων\r\nφερόμενοι, οὐδὲν ἀσπίδος δεόμενοι. τούτοις εἵπετο τῶν ἄλλων ἱππέων πλῆθος\r\nἀσπίδας φέροντες, οἱ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν ἵππων τοξεύοντες. πεζῶν [D] δὲ ὁ μὲν\r\nὁπλίτης ἦν ἐν τῷ μώσῳ συνάπτων ἐφ᾽ ἑκάτερα τοῖς ἱππεῦσιν· ἐξόπισθεν δὲ οἱ\r\nσφενδονῆται καὶ τοξόται καὶ ὁπόσον ἐκ χειρὸς βάλλει γυμνὸν ἀσπίδος καὶ\r\nθώρακος. οὕτω κοσμηθείσης τῆς φάλαγγος, μικρὰ τοῦ λαιοῦ κέρως προελθόντος\r\nἅπαν τὸ πολέμιον συνετετάρακτο καὶ οὐκ ἐφύλαττε τὴν τάξιν.(264) ἐγκειμένων\r\nδὲ τῶν ἱππέων καὶ οὐκ ἀνιέντων φεύγει μὲν αἰσχρῶς ὁ τὴν βασιλείαν αἴσχιον\r\nἁρπάσας, λείπει δὲ αὐτοῦ τὸν ἵππαρχον καὶ χιλιάρχους καὶ ταξιάρχους πάνυ\r\nπολλοὺς καὶ ἐρρωμένως ἀγωνιζομένους, ἐπὶ πᾶσι δὲ τὴν ποιητὴν τοῦ\r\nτερατώδους καὶ ἐξαγίστου δράματος, [58] ὃς πρῶτος ἐπὶ νοὺν ἐβάλετο\r\nμεταποιῆσαι τὴν βασιλείαν καὶ ἀφελέσθαι τοῦ γέρως ἡμᾶς.\r\n\r\n(Of these troops some carry lances and are protected by cuirasses and\r\nhelmets of wrought iron mail. They wear greaves that fit the legs closely,\r\nand knee‐caps, and on their thighs the same sort of iron covering. They\r\nride their horses exactly like statues, and need no shield. In the rear of\r\nthese was posted a large body of the rest of the cavalry, who carried\r\nshields, while others fought on horseback with bows and arrows. Of the\r\ninfantry the hoplites occupied the centre and supported the cavalry on\r\neither wing. In their rear were the slingers and archers and all troops\r\nthat shoot their missiles from the hand and have neither shield nor\r\ncuirass. This, then, was the disposition of our phalanx. The left wing\r\nslightly outflanked the enemy, whose whole force was thereby thrown into\r\nconfusion, and their line broke. When our cavalry made a charge and\r\nmaintained it stubbornly, he who had so shamefully usurped the imperial\r\npower disgraced himself by flight, and left there his cavalry commander\r\nand his numerous chiliarchs and taxiarchs, who continued to fight bravely,\r\nand in command of all these the real author(265) of that monstrous and\r\nunholy drama, who had been the first to suggest to him that he should\r\npretend to the imperial power and rob us of our royal privilege.)\r\n\r\nΚαὶ τέως μὲν(266) ἔχαιρε τῆς πρώτης πείρας οὐκ ἀποσφαλεὶς οὐδὲ ἁμαρτήσας,\r\nτέτε δὲ ἐφεστώσας ξὺν δίκῃ ποινὰς ἀπαιτεῖται τῶν ἔργων καὶ ἄπιστον\r\nτιμωρίαν εἰσπράττεται. πάντων γὰρ ὁπόσοι τοῦ πολέμου τῷ τυράννῳ\r\nσυνεφήψαντο ἐμφανὴς μὲν ὁ θάνατος, δήλη δ᾽ ἡ φυγὴ καὶ ἄλλων μεταμέλεια·\r\nἰκέτευον γὰρ πολλόι, [B] καὶ ἔτυχον ἅπαντες συγγνώμης, βασιλέως τὸν τῆς\r\nΦέτιδος ὑπερβαλλομένου μεγαλοφροσύνῃ. ὁ μὲν γάρ, ἐπειδὴ Πάτροκλος ἔπεσεν,\r\nοὐδὲ πιπράκειν ἁλόντας ἔτι τοὺς πολεμίους ἠξίου, ἀλλ᾽ ἱκετεύοντας περὶ\r\nτοῖς γόνασιν ἔκτεινεν· ὁ δὲ ἐκήρυττεν ἄδειαν τοῖς ἐξαρνουμένοις τὴν\r\nξυνωμοσίαν, οὐ θανάτου μόνον ἢ φυγῆς ἤ τινος ἄλλης τιμωρίας ἀφαιρῶν τὸν\r\nφόβον, ὥσπερ δὲ ἔκ τινος ταλαιπωρίας καὶ ἄλης δυστυχοῦς τῆς ξὺν [C] τῷ\r\nτυράννῳ βιοτῆς κατάγειν σφᾶς ἐπ᾽ ἀκεραίοις τοῖς πρόσθεν ἠξίου. τοῦτο μὲν\r\nδὴ καὶ αὖθις τεύξεται λόγου.\r\n\r\n(For a time indeed he enjoyed success, and at his first attempt met with\r\nno repulse or failure, but on that day he provoked the punishment that\r\njustice had in store for his misdeeds, and had to pay a penalty that is\r\nhardly credible. For all the others who abetted the usurper in that war\r\nmet death openly or their flight was evident to all, as was the repentance\r\nof others. For many came as suppliants, and all obtained forgiveness,\r\nsince the Emperor surpassed the son of Thetis in generosity. For Achilles,\r\nafter Patroclus fell, refused any longer even to sell those whom he took\r\ncaptive, but slew them as they clasped his knees and begged for mercy. But\r\nthe Emperor proclaimed an amnesty for those who should renounce the\r\nconspiracy, and so not only freed them from the fear of death or exile or\r\nsome other punishment, but, as though their association with the usurper\r\nhad been due to some misadventure or unhappy error, he deigned to\r\nreinstate them and completely cancel the past. I shall have occasion to\r\nrefer to this again.)\r\n\r\nἘκεῖνο δὲ ἤδη ῥητέον, ὡς οὔτε ἐν τοῖς κειμένοις ἦν οὔτε ἐν τοῖς φεύγουσιν\r\nὁ παιδοτρίβης τοῦ τυράννου. τὸ γὰρ μηδὲ ἐλπίσαι συγγνώμην εὔλογον οὕτω μὲν\r\nἄδικα διανοηθέντα, ἀσεβῆ δὲ ἐργασάμενον, φόνων τε ἀδίκων ἀνδρῶν καὶ\r\nγυναικῶν, πολλῶν μὲν ἰδιωτῶν, [D] πάντων δὲ σχεδὸν ὁπόσοι τοῦ βασιλείου\r\nγένους μετεῖχον ἁψάμενον, οὔτι ξὺν δείματι οὐδὲ ἄν τις ἐμφύλιον φόνον\r\nδιανοηθείν δρῶν, παλαμναίους τινὰς καὶ μιάστορας δεδιὼς καὶ ὑφορώμενος ἐκ\r\nτοῦ μιάσματος, ἀλλα ὥσπερ τισὶ καθαρσίοις καινοῖς καὶ ἀτόποις τοὺς πρόσθεν\r\nἀπονιπτόμενος ἄνδρα ἐπ᾽ ἀνδρὶ καὶ γυναῖκας ἐπὶ τοῖς φιλτάτοις ἀποκτιννὺς\r\nεἰκότως ἀπέγνω τὴν ἱκετηρίαν. ταῦτα εἰκὸς μὲν αὐτὸν διανοηθῆναι, [59]\r\nεἰκὸς δὲ καὶ ἄλλως ἔχειν. οὐ γὰρ δὴ ἴσμεν ὅ, τί ποτε παθὼν ἢ δράσας ᾤχετο\r\nἄιστος, ἄφαντος. ἀλλ᾽ εἴτε αὐτὸν δαίμων τιμωρὸς ξυναρπάσας, καθάπερ Ὅμηρός\r\nφησι τὰς τοῦ Πανδάρεω(267) θυγατέρας, ἐπὶ γῆς ἄγει πέρατα ποινὰς ἀπαιτήσων\r\nτῶν διανοημάτων, εἴτε αὐτὸν ὁ ποταμὸς ὑποδεξάμενος ἑστιᾶν κελεύει τοὺς\r\nἰχθῦς, οὔτι πω δῆλον. ἄχρι μὲν γὰρ τῆς μάχης αὐτῆς καὶ ὁπηνίκα οἱ λόχοι\r\nσυνετάττοντο πρὸς φάλαγγα θρασὺς [B] ἦν ἐν μέσοις ἀναστρεφόμενος; ἐπεὶ δὲ\r\nἐπράχθη(268) τὰ τῆς μάχης, ὥσπερ ἦν ἄξιον, ἀφανὴς ᾤχετο οὐκ οἶδα ὑπὸ τοῦ\r\nθεῶν ἢ δαιμόνων κρυφθείς, πλὴν ὅτι γε οὐκ ἐπ᾽ ἀμείνοσι ταῖς τύχαις\r\nεὔδηλον. οὐ γὰρ δὴ αὖθις ἔμελλε φανεὶς ἐπ᾽ ἐξουσίας ὑβρίζων ἀδεῶς\r\nεὐδαιμονήσειν, ὡς ᾤετο, ἀλλα ἐς τὸ παντελὲς ἀφανισθεὶς τιμωρίαν ὑφέξειν\r\nαὐτῷ μὲν δυστυχῆ, πολλοῖς δὲ ὠφέλιμον καὶ πρὸς ἐπανόρθωσιν.\r\n\r\n(But what I must now state is that the man who had trained and tutored the\r\nusurper was neither among the fallen nor the fugitives. It was indeed\r\nnatural that he should not even hope for pardon, since his schemes had\r\nbeen so wicked, his actions so infamous, and he had been responsible for\r\nthe slaughter of so many innocent men and women, of whom many were private\r\ncitizens, and of almost all who were connected with the imperial family.\r\nAnd he had done this not with shrinking nor with the sentiments of one who\r\nsheds the blood of his own people, and because of that stain of guilt\r\nfears and is on the watch for the avenger and those who will exact a\r\nbloody reckoning, but, with a kind of purification that was new and\r\nunheard of, he would wash his hands of the blood of his first victims, and\r\nthen go on to murder man after man, and then, after those whom they held\r\ndear, he slew the women as well. So he naturally abandoned the idea of\r\nappealing for mercy. But likely as it is that he should think thus, yet it\r\nmay well be otherwise For the fact is that we do not know what he did or\r\nsuffered before he vanished out of sight, out of our ken. Whether some\r\navenging deity snatched him away, as Homer says of the daughters of\r\nPandareos,(269) and even now is carrying him to the very verge of the\r\nworld to punish him for his evil designs, or whether the river(270) has\r\nreceived him and bids him feed the fishes, has not yet been revealed. For\r\ntill the battle actually began, and while the troops were forming the\r\nphalanx, he was full of confidence and went to and fro in the centre of\r\ntheir line. But when the battle was ended as was fitting, he vanished\r\ncompletely, taken from our sight by I know not what god or supernatural\r\nagency, only it is quite certain that the fate in store for him was far\r\nfrom enviable. At any rate he was not destined to appear again, and, after\r\ninsulting us with impunity, live prosperous and secure as he thought he\r\nshould; but he was doomed to be completely blotted out and to suffer a\r\npunishment that for him indeed was fatal but to many was beneficial and\r\ngave them a chance of recovery.)\r\n\r\nΤὰ μὲν δὴ περὶ τὸν μηχανοποιὸν τῆς ὅλης ὑποθέσεως πλείονος ἀξιωθέντα\r\nλόγου, [C] μέσῃ τῇ πράξει(271) παρελόμενα τὸ ξυνεχὲς τῆς διηγήσεως,\r\nἐνταῦθά που πάλιν ἀφετέα. ἐπανιτέον δὲ ὅθενπερ ἐξὴλθον καὶ ἀποδοτέον τὸ\r\nτέλος τῆς μάχης. οὐ γὰρ δὴ ξὺν τῇ τῶν στρατηγῶν δειλίᾳ καὶ τὰ τῶν\r\nστρατιωτῶν πίπτει φρονήματα, ἀλλ᾽ ἐπειδὴ τὰ τῆς τάξεως αὐτοῖς διεφθάρη, οὐ\r\nκακίᾳ σφῶν, ἀπειρίᾳ δὲ καὶ ἀμαθίᾳ τοῦ τάττοντος, κατὰ λόχους συνιστάμενοι\r\nδιηγωνίζοντο· καὶ ἦν τὸ ἔργον ἁπάσης ἐλπίδος μεῖζον, [D] τῶν μὲν οὐχ\r\nὑφιεμένων ἐς τὸ παντελὲς τοῖς κρατοῦσι, τῶν δὲ ἐπεξελθεῖν τελέως τῇ νίκῃ\r\nφιλοτιμουμένων, ξυμμιγής τε ᾔρετο τάραχος καὶ βοὴ καὶ κτύπος τῶν ὅπλων,\r\nξιφῶν τε ἀγνυμένων ἀμφὶ τοῖς κράνεσι καὶ τῶν ἀσπίδων περὶ τοῖς δόρασιν.\r\nἀνὴρ δὲ ἀνδρὶ ξυνίστατο, καὶ ἀπορριπτοῦντες τὰς ἀσπίδας αὐτοῖς τοῖς\r\nξίφεσιν ὠθοῦντο(272) μικρὰ τοῦ παθεῖν φροντίζοντες, ἅπαντα δὲ εἰς τὸ\r\nδρᾶσαί τι δεινὸν τοὺς πολεμίους τὸν θυμὸν τρέποντες, τοῦ μὴ καθαρὰν αὐτοῖς\r\nμηδὲ ἄδακρυν παρασχεῖν τὴν νίκην καὶ τὸ ἀποθνήσκειν ἀνταλλαττόμενοι.

So I\r\nmust leave that subject for the present, and going back to the point where\r\nI digressed, describe how the battle ended. For though their generals\r\nshowed such cowardice, the courage of the soldiers was by no means abated.\r\nWhen their line was broken, which was due not to their cowardice but to\r\nthe ignorance and inexperience of their leader, they formed into companies\r\nand kept up the fight. And what happened then was beyond all expectation;\r\nfor the enemy refused altogether to yield to those who were defeating\r\nthem, while our men did their utmost to achieve a signal victory, and so\r\nthere arose the wildest confusion, loud shouts mingled with the din of\r\nweapons, as swords were shattered against helmets and shields against\r\nspears. It was a hand to hand fight, in which they discarded their shields\r\nand attacked with swords only, while, indifferent to their own fate, and\r\ndevoting the utmost ardour to inflicting severe loss on the foe, they were\r\nready to meet even death if only they could make our victory seem doubtful\r\nand dearly bought. It was not only the infantry who behaved thus to their\r\npursuers, but even the cavalry, whose spears were broken and were now\r\nentirely useless. Their shafts are long and polished, and when they had\r\nbroken them they dismounted and transformed themselves into hoplites. So\r\nfor some time they held their own against the greatest odds. But since our\r\ncavalry kept shooting their arrows from a distance as they rode after\r\nthem, while the cuirassiers made frequent charges, as was easy on that\r\nunobstructed and level plain, and moreover night overtook them, the enemy\r\nwere glad at last to take to flight, while our men kept up a vigorous\r\npursuit as far as the camp and took it by assault, together with the\r\nbaggage and slaves and baggage animals. Directly the rout of the enemy had\r\nbegun, as I have described, and while we kept up a hot pursuit, they were\r\ndriven towards the left, where the river was on the right of the victors.\r\nAnd there the greatest slaughter took place, and the river was choked with\r\nthe bodies of men and horses, indiscriminately. For the Drave was not like\r\nthe Scamander, nor so kind to the fugitives; it did not put ashore and\r\ncast forth from its waters the dead in their armour, nor cover up and hide\r\nsecurely in its eddies those who escaped alive. For that is what the\r\nTrojan river did(277), perhaps out of kindness, perhaps it was only that\r\nit was so small that it offered an easy crossing to one who tried to swim\r\nor walk. In fact, when a single poplar was thrown into it, it formed a\r\nbridge,(278) and the whole river roared with foam and blood and beat upon\r\nthe shoulders of Achilles,(279) if indeed we may believe even this, but it\r\nnever did anything more violent. When a slight fire scorched it, it gave\r\nup fighting at once and swore not to play the part of ally. However this,\r\ntoo, was probably a jest on Homer’s part, when he invented that strange\r\nand unnatural sort of duel. For in the rest of the poem also he evidently\r\nfavours Achilles, and he sets the army there as mere spectators while he\r\nbrings Achilles on to the field as the only invincible and resistless\r\nwarrior, and makes him slay all whom he encounters and put every one of\r\nthe foe to flight, simply by his voice and bearing and the glance of his\r\neyes, both when the battle begins and on the banks of the Scamander, till\r\nthe fugitives were glad to gather within the wall of the city. Many verses\r\nhe devotes to relating this, and then he invents the battles of the gods,\r\nand by embellishing his poem with such tales he corrupts his critics and\r\nprevents us from giving a fair and honest vote. But if there be any one\r\nwho refuses to be beguiled by the beauty of the words and the fictions\r\nthat are imported into the poem ...(280), then, though he is as strict as\r\na member of the Areopagus, I shall not dread his decision. For we are\r\nconvinced by the poem that the son of Peleus is a brave soldier. He slays\r\ntwenty men; then)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ζωοὺς δ᾽ ἐκ ποταμοῖο δυώδεκα λέξατο κούρους,\r\n    Τοὺς ἐξῆγε θύραζε τεθηπότας ἠύτε νεβρούς,\r\n    Ποινὴν Πατρόκλοιο Μενοιτιάδαο θανόντος.\r\n\r\n    (“He chose twelve youths alive out of the river and led them forth\r\n    amazed like fawns to atone for the death of Patroclus, son of\r\n    Menoitius.”)(281)\r\n\r\n\r\nτοσαύτην μέντοι ἤνεγκεν εἰς τὰ πράγματα τῶν Ἀχαιῶν ἡ νίκη τὴν ῥοπήν, [C]\r\nὥστε οὐδὲ μείζονα φόβον τοῖς πολεμίοις ἐνέβαλεν οὐδὲ ἀπογνῶναι ἐς τὸ\r\nπαντελὲς ὑπὲρ σφῶν ἐποίει. καὶ ὑπὲρ τούτων ἆρ᾽ ἑτέρου τινὸς μάρτυρος\r\nδεησόμεθα τὸν Ὅμηρον παραλιπόντες; [D] καὶ οὐκ ἀπόχρη τῶν ἐπῶν μνησθῆναι,\r\nἃ πεποίηκεν ἐκεῖνος, ὁπηνίκα ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς ἦλθεν ὁ Πρίαμος φέρων ὑπὲρ τοῦ\r\nπαιδὸς τὰ λύτρα; ἐρομένου γὰρ μετὰ τὰς διαλύσεις, ὑπὲρ(282) ὧν ἀφῖκτο, τοῦ\r\nτῆς Θέτιδος υἱέος\r\n\r\n(But his victory, though it had some influence on the fortunes of the\r\nAchaeans, was not enough to inspire any great fear in the enemy, nor did\r\nit make them wholly despair of their cause. On this point shall we set\r\nHomer aside and demand some other witness? Or is it not enough to recall\r\nthe verses in which he describes how Priam came to the ships bringing his\r\nson’s ransom? For after he had made the truce for which he had come, and\r\nthe son of Thetis asked:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ποσσῆμαρ μέμονας κτερεïζέμεν Ἕκτορα δῖον,\r\n\r\n    (“For how many days dost thou desire to make a funeral for noble\r\n    Hector?”)\r\n\r\n\r\nτά τε ἄλλα διέξεισι καὶ περὶ τοῦ πολέμου φησί·\r\n\r\n(He told him not only that, but concerning the war he said:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Τῇ δὲ δυωδεκάτῃ πολεμίξομεν,(283) εἴπερ ἀνάγκη.\r\n\r\n    (“And on the twelfth day we will fight again, if fight we\r\n    must.”(284))\r\n\r\n\r\n[62] οὕτως οὐδὲ ἐπαγγέλλειν ὀκνεῖ μετὰ τὴν ἐκεχειρίαν τὸν πόλεμον. ὁ δὲ\r\nἀγεννὴς καὶ δειλὸς τύραννος ὄρη τε ὑψηλὰ προυτείνετο τῆς αὑτοῦ φυγῆς καὶ\r\nἐξοικοδομήσας ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς φρούρια οὐδὲ τῇ τῶν τόπων ὀχυρότητι πιστεύει,\r\nἀλλὰ ἱκετεύει συγγνώμης τυγχάνειν. καὶ ἔτυχεν ἄν,(285) εἴπερ ἦν ἄξιος καὶ\r\nμὴ ἐφωράθη πολλάκις ἄπιστος καὶ θρασύς, ἄλλα ἐπ᾽ ἄλλοις προστιθεὶς\r\nἀδικήματα.\r\n\r\n(You see he does not hesitate to announce that war will be resumed after\r\nthe armistice. But the unmanly and cowardly usurper sheltered his flight\r\nbehind lofty mountains and built forts on them; nor did he trust even to\r\nthe strength of the position, but begged for forgiveness. And he would\r\nhave obtained it had he deserved it, and not proved himself on many\r\noccasions both treacherous and insolent, by heaping one crime on another.)\r\n\r\nΤὰ μὲν δὴ κατὰ τὴν μάχην, εἰ μὴ δόξῃ τις τῶν διηγουμένων προσέχειν ἐθέλοι\r\nμηδὲ [B] ἔπεσιν εὖ πεποιημένοις, ἐς αὐτὰ δὲ ὁρᾶν τὰ ἔργα, κρινέτω. ἑξῆς\r\nδ᾽, εἰ βούλεσθε τὴν Αἴαντος ὑπὲρ τῶν νεῶν καὶ τὴν ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους τῶν\r\nἈχαιῶν ἀντιθεῖναι μάχην τοῖς ἐπὶ τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης ἔργοις· ᾗ δὴ Μυγδόνιος\r\nποταμῶν κάλλιστος τὴν αὑτοῦ προστίθησι φήμην, οὔσῃ δὲ καὶ Ἀντιόχου\r\nβασιλέως ἐπωνύμῳ· γέγονε δὲ αὐτῇ καὶ ἕτερον ὄνομα βάρβαρον, σύνηθες τοῖς\r\nπολλοῖς ὑπὸ τῆς πρὸς τοὺς τῇδε βαρβάρους ἐπιμιξίας· ταύτην δὴ τὴν πὸλιν\r\nστρατὸς ἀμήχανος πλήθει Παρθυαίων [C] ξὺν Ἰνδοῖς περιέσχεν, ὁπηνίκα ἐπὶ\r\nτὸν τύραννον βαδίζειν προύκειτο· καὶ ὅπερ Ἡρακλεῖ φασιν ἐπὶ τὸ Λερναῖον\r\nἰόντι θηρίον συνενεχθῆναι, τὸν θαλάττιον καρκίνον, τοῦτο ἦν ὁ Παρθυαίων\r\nβασιλεὺς ἐκ τῆς ἠπείρου Τίγρητα διαβὰς καὶ περιτειχίζων(286) τὴν πόλιν\r\nχώμασιν· εἶτα εἰς ταῦτα δεχόμενος τὸν Μυγδόνιον λίμνην ἀπέφηνε τὸ περὶ τῷ\r\nἄστει χωρίον καὶ ὥσπερ νῆσον ἐν αὐτῇ συνεῖχε τὴν πόλιν, [D] μικρὸν\r\nὑπερεχουσῶν καὶ ὑπερφαινομένων τῶν ἐπάλξεων. ἐπολιόρκει δὲ ναῦς τε ἐπάγων\r\nκαὶ ἐπὶ νεῶν μηχανάς· καὶ ἦν οὐχ ἡμέρας ἔργον, μηνῶν δὲ οἶμαι σχεδόν τι\r\nτεττάρων. οἱ δὲ ἐν τῷ τείχει συνεχῶς ἀπεκρούοντο τοὺς βαρβάρους\r\nκαταπιμπράντες τὰς μηχανὰς τοῖς πυρφόροις· ναῦς δὲ ἀνεῖλκον πολλὰς μὲν ἐκ\r\nτοῦ τείχους, ἄλλαι δὲ κατεάγνυντο ὑπὸ ῥώμης τῶν ἀφιεμένων ὀργάνων καὶ\r\nβάρους τῶν βελῶν.

Accordingly we will next, if you please, compare the fighting\r\nof Ajax in defence of the ships and of the Achaeans at the wall with the\r\nEmperor’s achievements at that famous city. I mean the city to which the\r\nMygdonius, fairest of rivers, gives its name, though it has also been\r\nnamed after King Antiochus. Then, too, it has another, a barbarian\r\nname(288) which is familiar to many of you from your intercourse with the\r\nbarbarians of those parts. This city was besieged by an overwhelming\r\nnumber of Parthians with their Indian allies, at the very time when the\r\nEmperor was prepared to march against the usurper. And like the sea crab\r\nwhich they say engaged Heracles in battle when he sallied forth to attack\r\nthe Lernaean monster,(289) the King of the Parthians, crossing the Tigris\r\nfrom the mainland, encircled the city with dykes. Then he let the\r\nMygdonius flow into these, and transformed all the space about the city\r\ninto a lake, and completely hemmed it in as though it were an island, so\r\nthat only the ramparts stood out and showed a little above the water. Then\r\nhe besieged it by bringing up ships with siege‐engines on board. This was\r\nnot the work of a day, but I believe of almost four months. But the\r\ndefenders within the wall continually repulsed the barbarians by burning\r\nthe siege‐engines with their fire‐darts. And from the wall they hauled up\r\nmany of the ships, while others were shattered by the force of the engines\r\nwhen discharged and the weight of the missiles. For some of the stones\r\nthat were hurled on to them weighed as much as seven Attic talents.(290)\r\nWhen this had been going on for many days in succession, part of the dyke\r\ngave way and the water flowed in in full tide, carrying with it a portion\r\nof the wall as much as a hundred cubits long.(291))\r\n\r\nἘνταῦθα κοσμεῖ τὴν στρατιὰν τὸν Περσικὸν τρόπον. διασώζουσι γὰρ καὶ\r\nἀπομιμοῦνται τὰ Περσικὰ οὐκ ἀξιοῦντες, ἐμοὶ δοκεῖν, Παρθυαῖοι νομίζεσθαι,\r\n[B] Πέρσαι δὲ εἶναι προσποιούμενοι. ταῦτά τοι καὶ στολῇ Μηδικῇ χαίρουσι.\r\nκαὶ ἐς μάχας ἔρχονται ὁμοίως ἐκείνοις ὅπλοις τε ἀγαλλόμενοι τοιούτοις καὶ\r\nἐσθήμασιν ἐπιχρύσοις καὶ ἁλουργέσι. σοφίζονται δὲ ἐντεῦθεν τὸ μὴ δοκεῖν\r\nἀφεστάναι Μακεδόνων, ἀναλαβεῖν δὲ τὴν ἐξ ἀρχαίου βασιλείαν προσήκουσαν.\r\nοὐκοῦν καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ξέρξην μιμούμενος ἐπί τινος χειροποιήτου καθῆστο\r\nγηλόφου, προῆγε(292) δὲ ἡ στρατιὰ ξὺν τοῖς θηρίοις. ταῦτα δὲ ἐξ Ἰνδῶν\r\nεἵπετο, καὶ ἔφερεν ἐκ σιδήρου πύργους τοξοτῶν πλήρεις. ἡγοῦντο δὲ αὐτῶν\r\nἱππεῖς οἱ θωρακοφόροι καὶ οἱ τοξόται, [C] ἕτερον ἱππέων πλῆθος ἀμήχανον.\r\nτὸ πεζὸν γάρ σφιν ἀχρεῖον ἐς τὰ πολεμικὰ καθέστηκεν οὔτε ἐντίμου μετέχον\r\nτάξεως οὔτε ὄν σφιν ἐν χρείᾳ, πεδιάδος οὔσης καὶ ψιλῆς τῆν χώρας ὁπόσην\r\nνέμονται ἔιοκε γὰρ δὴ τὰ τοιαῦτα πρὸς τὰς τοῦ πολέμου χρείας τιμῆς καὶ\r\nἀτιμίας ἀξιοῦσθαι. ὡς οὖν ἀχρεῖον τῇ φύσει οὐδὲ ἐκ τῶν νόμων πολυωρίας\r\nἀξιοῦται. συνέβη δὲ οὕτω καὶ περὶ τὴν Κρήτην καὶ Καρίαν καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις [D]\r\nδὲ μυρίοις ἔθνεσι τὰ περὶ τὸν πόλεμον κατασκευασθῆναι. οὐκοῦν καὶ ἡ\r\nΘετταλῶν οὖσα πεδιὰς ἱππεῦσιν ἐναγωνίζεσθαι καὶ ἐμμελετᾶν ἐπιτήδειος\r\nἐφάνη. τὰ γὰρ δὴ τῆς ἡμετέρας πόλεως, ἅτε ἐς ἀντιπάλους παντοδαποὺς\r\nκαταστάντα, εὐβουλίᾳ καὶ τύχῃ περιγενόμενα, εἰκότως ἐς ἅπαν εἶδος ὅπλων τε\r\nκαὶ παρασκευῆς ἄλλης(293) ἡρμόσθη.\r\n\r\n(Thereupon he arrayed the besieging army in the Persian fashion. For they\r\nkeep up and imitate Persian customs, I suppose, because they do not wish\r\nto be considered Parthians, and so pretend to be Persians. That is surely\r\nthe reason why they prefer the Persian manner of dress. And when they\r\nmarch to battle they look like them, and take pride in wearing the same\r\narmour, and raiment adorned with gold and purple. By this means they try\r\nto evade the truth and to make it appear that they have not revolted from\r\nMacedon, but are merely resuming the empire that was theirs of old. Their\r\nking, therefore, imitating Xerxes, sat on a sort of hill that had been\r\nartificially made, and his army advanced accompanied by their beasts.(294)\r\nThese came from India and carried iron towers full of archers. First came\r\nthe cavalry who wore cuirasses, and the archers, and then the rest of the\r\ncavalry in huge numbers. For infantry they find useless for their sort of\r\nfighting and it is not highly regarded by them. Nor, in fact, is it\r\nnecessary to them, since the whole of the country that they inhabit is\r\nflat and bare. For a military force is naturally valued or slighted in\r\nproportion to its actual usefulness in war. Accordingly, since infantry\r\nis, from the nature of the country, of little use to them, it is granted\r\nno great consideration in their laws. This happened in the case of Crete\r\nand Caria as well, and countless nations have a military equipment like\r\ntheirs. For instance the plains of Thessaly have proved suitable for\r\ncavalry engagements and drill. Our state, on the other hand, since it has\r\nhad to encounter adversaries of all sorts, and has won its pre‐eminence by\r\ngood judgment combined with good luck, has naturally adapted itself to\r\nevery kind of armour, and to a varying equipment.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ ταῦτα μὲν ἴσως οὐδὲν πρὸς τὸν λόγον, ὡς ἂν εἴποιεν οἱ ταῖς τῶν\r\nἐπαίνων τέχναις καθάπερ νόμοις ἐπιτεταγμένοι· ἐγὼ δὲ εἰ μὲν τί σοι\r\nπροσήκει καὶ τούτων, ἐν καιρῷ σκέψομαι, [64] τά γε μὴν ὀνείδη τῶν ἀνθρώπων\r\nοὐ χαλεπῶς ἀπολύομαι. φημὶ γὰρ ὡς οὔτε ἐγὼ τῶν τεχνῶν μεταποιοῦμαι οὔτε\r\nὅστις μή τισιν ὡμολόγησεν ἐμμενεῖν ἀδικεῖ μὴ φυλάττων ταῦτα· τυχὸν δὲ καὶ\r\nἄλλων οὐκ ἀπορήσομεν εὐπρεπῶν παραιτήσεων. ἀλλ᾽ οὐ γὰρ ἄξιον μακρότερον\r\nεἰς οὐδὲν δέον ἀπαρτᾶν τὸν λόγον καὶ ἀποπλανᾶσθαι τῆς ὑποθέσεως.\r\nἐπαναβῶμεν οὖν αὖθις εἰς ἴχνος καὶ ὅθεν ἐξέβην.\r\n\r\n(But perhaps those who watch over the rules for writing panegyric as\r\nthough they were laws, may say that all this is irrelevant to my speech.\r\nNow whether what I have been saying partly concerns you I shall consider\r\nat the proper time.

And\r\nat the signal to charge they all pressed forward, since every man of them\r\nwas eager to be the first to scale the wall(299) and win the glory of that\r\nexploit. They did not imagine that there was anything to fear, nor did\r\nthey believe that the besieged would resist their assault. Such was the\r\nexaggerated confidence of the Parthians. The besieged, however, kept their\r\nphalanx unbroken at the gap in the wall, and on the portion of the wall\r\nthat was still intact they posted all the non‐combatants in the city, and\r\ndistributed among them an equal number of soldiers. But when the enemy\r\nrode up and not a single missile was hurled at them from the wall, their\r\nconfidence that they would completely reduce the city was strengthened,\r\nand they whipped and spurred on their horses so that their flanks were\r\ncovered with blood, until they had left the dykes behind them. These dykes\r\nthey had made earlier to dam the mouth of the Mygdonius, and the mud\r\nthereabouts was very deep. In fact there was hardly any ground at all\r\nbecause of the wood,(300) and because the soil was so rich, and of the\r\nsort that conceals springs under its surface. Moreover there was in that\r\nplace a wide moat that had been made long ago to protect the town, and had\r\nbecome filled up with a bog of considerable depth. Now when the enemy had\r\nalready reached this moat and were trying to cross it, a large force of\r\nthe besieged made a sally, while many others hurled stones from the walls.\r\nThen many of the besiegers were slain, and all with one accord turned\r\ntheir horses in flight, though only from their gestures could it be seen\r\nthat flight was what they desired and intended. For, as they were in the\r\nact of wheeling them about, their horses fell and bore down the riders\r\nwith them. Weighed down as they were by their armour, they floundered\r\nstill deeper in the bog, and the carnage that ensued has never yet been\r\nparalleled in any siege of the same kind.)\r\n\r\nἘπεὶ δὲ τὰ τῶν ἱππέων ὧδε ἐπεπράγει, τῶν ἐλεφάντων πειρῶνται,\r\nκαταπλήξεσθαι μᾶλλον οἰόμενοι τῷ ξένῳ τῆς μάχης· οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοσοῦτον αὐτοῖς\r\nτὰ τῶν ὀμμάτων διέφθαρτο, ὡς μὴ καθορᾶν βαρύτερον μὲν ὂν ἵππου τὸ θηρίον,\r\nφέρον δὲ ἄχθος οὐχ ἵππων δυοῖν ἢ πλειόνων, ἁμαξῶν δὲ οἶμαι συχνῶν, [C]\r\nτοξότας καὶ ἀκοντιστὰς καὶ σιδηροῦν πύργον. ταῦτα δὲ ἦν ἅπαντα πρὸς τὸ\r\nχωρίον χειροποίητον γεγονὸς τέλμα κωλύματα, καὶ ἦν αὐτοῖς ἔργῳ φανερά·\r\nὅθεν οὐκ εἰκὸς εἰς μάχην ἰέναι, ἀλλὰ ἐς κατάπληξιν τῶν ἔνδον\r\nπαρασκευάζεσθαι. προσῆγον δὲ ἐν τάξει μέτρον διεστῶτες ἀλλήλων ἴσον, καὶ\r\nἐῴκει τείχει τῶν Παρθυαίων ἡ φάλανξ· τὰ μὲν θηρία(301) τοὺς πύργους\r\nφέροντα, τῶν ὁπλιτῶν δὲ ἀναπληρούντων τὰ ἐν μέσῳ. ταχθέντες δὲ οὕτως οὐ\r\nμέγα ὄφελος ἦσαν τῷ βαρβάρῳ· [D] παρεῖχον γὰρ ἡδονὴν καὶ τέρψιν τοῖς ἐκ\r\nτοῦ τείχους θεωμένοις. ὡς δὲ ἐγένοντο διακορεῖς οἱονεὶ λαμπρᾶς καὶ\r\nπολυτελοῦς πομπῆς πεμπομένης, λίθους ἐκ μηχανῶν ἀφιέντες καὶ τόξοις\r\nβάλλοντες ἐς τὴν τειχομαχίαν προυκαλοῦντο τοὺς βαρβάρους. φύσει δὲ ὄντες\r\nεἰς ὀργὴν ὀξύρροποι καὶ δεινὸν ποιούμενοι τὸ γέλωτα ὀφλῆσαι καὶ ἀπαγαγεῖν\r\nὀπίσω τὴν παρασκευὴν ἄπρακτον, ἐγκελευομένου σφίσι τοῦ βασιλέως, προσῆγον\r\nτῷ τείχει καὶ ἐβάλλοντο πυκνοῖς(302) τοῖς λίθοις καὶ τοῖς τοξεύμασι· [66]\r\nκαὶ ἐτρώθη τῶν θηρίων τινὰ καὶ ἀπέθανεν κατενεχθέντα(303) ὑπὸ τῆς ἰλυος.\r\nδείσαντες δὶ καὶ ὑπὲρ τῶν ἄλλων ἀπῆγον ὀπίσω πάλιν εἰς τὸ στρατόπεδον.\r\n\r\n(Since this fate had overtaken the cavalry, they tried the elephants,\r\nthinking that they would be more likely to overawe us by that novel sort\r\nof fighting. For surely they had not been stricken so blind as not to see\r\nthat an elephant is heavier than a horse, since it carries the load, not\r\nof two horses or several, but what would, I suppose, require many waggons,\r\nI mean archers and javelin men and the iron tower besides. All this was a\r\nserious hindrance, considering that the ground was artificially made and\r\nhad been converted into a bog. And this the event made plain. Hence it is\r\nprobable that they were not advancing to give battle, but rather were\r\narrayed to overawe the besieged. They came on in battle line at equal\r\ndistances from one another, in fact the phalanx of the Parthians resembled\r\na wall, with the elephants carrying the towers, and hoplites filling up\r\nthe spaces between. But drawn up as these were they were of no great use\r\nto the barbarian. It was, however, a spectacle which gave the defenders on\r\nthe wall great pleasure and entertainment, and when they had gazed their\r\nfill at what resembled a splendid and costly pageant in procession, they\r\nhurled stones from their engines, and, shooting their arrows, challenged\r\nthe barbarians to fight for the wall. Now the Parthians are naturally\r\nquick‐tempered, and they could not endure to incur ridicule and lead back\r\nthis imposing force without striking a blow; so by the king’s express\r\ncommand they charged at the wall and received a continuous fire of stones\r\nand arrows, while some of the elephants were wounded, and perished by\r\nsinking into the mud. Thereupon, in fear for the others also, they led\r\nthem back to the camp.)\r\n\r\nὩς δὲ καὶ ταύτης ὁ Παρθυαῖος ἥμαρτε τῆς πείρας, τοὺς τοξότας διελὼν εἰς\r\nμοίρας διαδέχεσθαί τε ἀλλήλους κελεύει καὶ συνεχῶς βάλλειν πρὸς τὸ\r\nδιερρηγμένον τοῦ τείχους, ὡς μὴ δυνηθεῖεν ἀποικοδομῆσαι καὶ ἔχειν ἀσφαλῶς\r\nτὴν πόλιν· οὕτω γὰρ αἱρήσειν λαθὼν ἢ βιασάμενος τῷ πλήθει τους ἔνδον\r\nἤλπιζε.

For he hoped by this\r\nmeans either to take it by surprise, or by mere numbers to overwhelm the\r\ngarrison. But the preparations that had been made by the Emperor made it\r\nclear that the barbarian’s plan was futile. For in the rear of the\r\nhoplites a second wall was being built, and while he thought they were\r\nusing the old line of the wall for the foundations and that the work was\r\nnot yet in hand, they had laboured continuously for a whole day and night\r\ntill the wall had risen to a height of four cubits. And at daybreak it\r\nbecame visible, a new and conspicuous piece of work. Moreover the besieged\r\ndid not for a moment yield their ground, but kept relieving one another\r\nand shooting their javelins at those who were attacking the fallen wall,\r\nand all this terribly dismayed the barbarian. Nevertheless he did not at\r\nonce lead off his army but employed the same efforts over again. But when\r\nhe had done as before, and as before suffered repulse, he did lead his\r\narmy back, having lost many whole tribes through famine, and squandered\r\nmany lives over the dykes and in the siege. He had also put to death many\r\nsatraps one after another, on various charges, blaming one of them because\r\nthe dykes had not been made strong enough, but gave way and were flooded\r\nby the waters of the river, another because when fighting under the walls\r\nhe had not distinguished himself; and others he executed for one offence\r\nor another. This is in fact the regular custom among the barbarians in\r\nAsia, to shift the blame of their ill‐success on to their subjects. Thus\r\nthen the king acted on that occasion, and afterwards took himself off. And\r\nfrom that time he has kept the peace with us and has never asked for any\r\ncovenant or treaty, but he stays at home and is thankful if only the\r\nEmperor does not march against him and exact vengeance for his audacity\r\nand folly.)\r\n\r\nἎρά γε ἄξιον ταύτην παραβαλεῖν τὴν μάχην ταῖς ὑπὲρ τῶν νεῶν τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν\r\nκαὶ τοῦ τείχους; ἀθρεῖτε δὲ ὧδε τὴν ὁμοιότητα καὶ τὸ διάφορον λογίζεσθε.\r\nἙλλήνων μὲν Αἴαντε καὶ οἱ Λαπίθαι καὶ Μενεσθεὺς τοῦ τείχους εἶξαν καὶ\r\nπεριεῖδον τὰς πύλας συντριβομένας ὑφ᾽ Ἕκτορος καὶ τῶν ἐπάλξεων ἐπιβεβηκότα\r\nτὸν Σαρπηδάνα.

Observe the following\r\npoints of similarity, and note also the difference. Of the Greeks the two\r\nAjaxes, the Lapithae and Menestheus fell back from the wall and looked on\r\nhelplessly while the gates were battered down by Hector, and Sarpedon\r\nscaled the battlements. But our garrison did not give way even when the\r\nwall fell in of itself, but they fought and won, and repulsed the\r\nParthians, aided though these were by their Indian allies. Then again\r\nHector went up on to the ships and fought from their decks on foot, and as\r\nthough from behind a rampart, whereas our garrison first had to fight a\r\nnaval battle from the walls, and finally, while Hector and Sarpedon had to\r\nretreat from the battlements and the ships, the garrison routed not only\r\nthe forces that brought ships to the attack but the land force as well.\r\nNow it is appropriate that by some happy chance my speech should have\r\nalluded to Hector and Sarpedon, and to what I may call the very crown of\r\ntheir achievements, I mean the destruction of that wall which Homer tells\r\nus the Achaeans built only the day before, on the advice of the princely\r\norator(306) of Pylos “to be an impregnable bulwark for the ships and the\r\narmy.”(307))\r\n\r\nΣχεδὸν γάρ μοι τοῦτο φαίνεται τὸ γενναιότατον τῶν ἔργων Ἕκτορος, καὶ οὐχὶ\r\nΓλαύκου τέχνης(308) συνεῖναι οὐδὲ σοφωτέρας ἐπινοίας δεῖται, Ὁμήρου σαφῶς\r\nδιδάσκοντος, ὡς Ἀχιλλέως μὲν φανέντος\r\n\r\n(For that I think was almost the proudest of Hector’s achievements, and he\r\ndid not need the craft of Glaucus to help him, or any wiser plan, for\r\nHomer says plainly that the moment Achilles appeared)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ἐδύσετο οὐλαμὸν ἀνδρῶν.\r\n\r\n    (“He shrank back into the crowd of men.”(309))\r\n\r\n\r\n[D] Ἀγαμέμνονος δὲ τοῖς Τρωσὶν ἐπικειμένου καὶ ἐς τὸ τεῖχος καταδιώξαντος\r\nἝκτορα ὕπαγε Ζεύς, ἵνα ἀποσώζοιτο καθ᾽ ἡσυχίαν. προσπαίζων δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ\r\nποιητὴς καὶ καταγελῶν τῆς δειλίας ὑπὸ τῇ φηγῷ καὶ πρὸς ταῖς πύλαις ἤδη\r\nκαθημένῳ τὴν Ἶριν ἥκειν ἔφη παρὰ τοῦ Διὸς φράζουσαν\r\n\r\n(Again, when Agamemnon attacked the Trojans and pursued them to the wall,\r\nZeus stole away(310) Hector so that he might escape at his leisure. And\r\nthe poet is mocking him and ridiculing his cowardice when he says that as\r\nhe was sitting under the oak‐tree, being already near the gate, Iris came\r\nto him with this message from Zeus:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ὄφρ᾽ ἂν μέν κεν ὁρᾷς Ἀγαμέμνονα ποιμένα λαῶν\r\n    Θύνοντ᾽ ἐν προμάχοισιν, ἐναίροντα στίχας ἀνδρῶν, [68]\r\n    Τόφρ᾽ ὑπόεικε μάχης.\r\n\r\n    (“So long as thou seest Agamemnon, shepherd of the host, raging\r\n    among the foremost fighters and cutting down the ranks of men, so\r\n    long do thou keep back from the fight.”(311))\r\n\r\n\r\nπῶς γὰρ εἰκὸς οὕτως ἀγεννῆ καὶ δειλὰ παραινεῖν τὸν Δία, ἄλλως τε οὐδὲ\r\nμαχομένῳ, ξὺν πολλῇ δὲ ἑστῶτι ῥᾳστώνῃ; καὶ ὁπηνίκα δὲ ὁ τοῦ Τυδέως, τῆς\r\nἀθηνᾶς πολλὴν ἐκ τοῦ κράνους ἀναπτούσης φλόγα, πολλοὺς μὲν ἔκτεινε,\r\nφεύγειν δὲ ἠνάνκαζε τοὺς ὑπομένοντας, [B] πόρῥω τε ἀφειστήκει τοῦ πολέμου,\r\nκαὶ πολλὰ ὑπομένων ὀνείδη ἀπέγνω μὲν κρατοῦσι τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖς ἀντιστῆναι,\r\nεὐπρεπῆ δὲ ποιεῖται τὴν εἰς τὸ ἄστυ πορείαν, ὡς τῇ μητρὶ παραινέσων\r\nἐξιλεοῦσθαι τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν μετὰ τῶν Τρωάδων. καίτοι εἰ μὲν αὐτὸς ἱκέτευε πρὸ\r\nτοῦ νεὼ ξὺν τῇ γερουσίᾳ, πολὺν ἂν(312) εἶχε λόγον· προσήκει γὰρ οἶμαι τὸν\r\nστρατηγὸν ἢ βασιλέα καθάπερ ἱερέα καὶ προφήτην θεραπεύειν ἀεὶ ξὺν κόσμῳ\r\nτὸν θεὸν καὶ μηδὲν ὀλιγωρεῖν [C] μηδὲ ἑτέρῳ μᾶλλον προσήκειν ἡγεῖσθαι μηδὲ\r\nἐπιτρέπειν, ἀνάξιον αὑτοῦ νομίζοντα τὸ διακόνημα.\r\n\r\n(For is it likely that Zeus would give such base and cowardly advice,\r\nespecially to one who was not even fighting, but was standing there very\r\nmuch at his ease? And while the son of Tydeus, on whose head Athene\r\nkindled a mighty flame, was slaying many and forcing to flight all who\r\nstayed to encounter him, Hector stood far away from the battle. Though he\r\nhad to endure many taunts, he despaired of making a stand against the\r\nAchaeans, but made a specious excuse for going to the city to advise his\r\nmother to propitiate Athene in company with the Trojan women. And yet if\r\nin person he had besought the goddess before the temple, with the elders,\r\nhe would have had good reason for that, for it is only proper, in my\r\nopinion, that a general or king should always serve the god with the\r\nappointed ritual, like a priest or prophet, and not neglect this duty nor\r\nthink it more fitting for another, and depute it as though he thought such\r\na service beneath his own dignity.)\r\n\r\nΟἶμαι γὰρ τὴν Πλάτωνος μικρὰ παρατρέψας λέξιν οὐχ ἁμαρτήσεσθαι, ὡς ὅτῳ\r\nἀνδρί, μᾶλλον δὲ βασιλεῖ, ἐς τὸν θεὸν ἀνήρτηται πάντα τὰ πρὸς εὐδαιμονίαν\r\nφέροντα καὶ μὴ ἐν ἄλλοις ἀνθρώποις αἰωρεῖται, ἐξ ὧν εὖ ἢ κακῶς πραξάντων\r\nπλανᾶσθαι [D] ἀναγκάζεται αὐτὸς καὶ τὰ ἐκείνου πράγματα, τούτῳ ἄριστα\r\nπαρεσκεύασται πρὸς τὸ ζῆν. εἰ δὲ ἐπιτρέποι μηδεὶς μεταγράφειν(313) μηδὲ\r\nἐκτρέπειν μηδὲ μεταλαμβάνειν τοὔνομα, ἀλλὰ ὥσπερ ἱερὸν ἀρχαῖον κελεύοι\r\nμένειν ἐᾶν ἀκίνητον, οὐδὲ οὕτως ἄλλο τι διανοεῖσθαι τὸν σοφὸν ἐροῦμεν. τὸ\r\nγὰρ εἰς ἑαυτὸν(314) οὐ δήπου τὸ σῶμά φησιν οὐδὲ τὰ χρήματα οὐδὲ εὐγένειαν\r\nκαὶ δόξαν πατέρων· ταῦτα γὰρ αὐτοῦ μέν τινος οἰκεῖα κτήματα, οὐ μήν ἐστι\r\nταῦτα αὐτός· ἀλλὰ νοῦν καὶ φρόνησιν,(315) φησί, καὶ τὸ ὅλον τὸν ἐν ἡμῖν\r\nθεόν·(316) ὃ δὴ καὶ αὐτὸς [69] ἑτέρωθι κυριώτατον ἐν ἡμῖν ψυχῆς εἶδος ἔφη,\r\nκαὶ ὡς ἄρα αὐτὸν δαίμονα θεὸς ἑκάστῳ δέδωκε, τοῦτο ὃ δή φαμεν οἰκεῖν μὲν\r\nἡμῶν ἐπ᾽ ἄκρῳ τῷ σώματι, πρὸς δὲ τὴν ἐν οὐρανῷ ξυγγένειαν ἀπὸ γῆς ἡμᾶς\r\nαἴρειν. ἐς τοῦτο γὰρ ἔοικεν ἐπιτάττειν ἀνηρτῆσθαι χρῆναι ἑκάστῳ ἀνδρί, καὶ\r\nοὐκ εἰς ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους, οἳ τὰ μὲν ἄλλα βλάπτειν καὶ κωλύειν ἐθέλοντες\r\nπολλάκις ἐδυνήθησαν· ἤδη δέ τινες καὶ μὴ βουλόμενοι τῶν ἡμετέρων τινὰ\r\nπαρείλοντο.

For when\r\nhe says “depends on himself,” assuredly he does not refer to a man’s body\r\nor his property, or long descent, or distinguished ancestors. For these\r\nare indeed his belongings, but they are not the man himself; his real self\r\nis his mind, his intelligence, and, in a word, the god that is in us. As\r\nto which, Plato elsewhere calls it “the supreme form of the soul that is\r\nwithin us,” and says that “God has given it to each one of us as a guiding\r\ngenius, even that which we say dwells in the summit of our body and raises\r\nus from earth towards our celestial affinity.”(320) It is on this that he\r\nplainly says every man ought to depend, and not on other men, who have so\r\noften succeeded when they wish to harm and hinder us in other respects.\r\nIndeed it has happened before now that even without such a desire men have\r\ndeprived us of certain of our possessions. But this alone cannot be\r\nhindered or harmed, since “Heaven does not permit the bad to injure what\r\nis better than itself.”(321) This saying also is from Plato. But it may be\r\nthat I am wearying you with these doctrines of his with which I sprinkle\r\nmy own utterances in small quantities, as with salt or gold dust. For salt\r\nmakes our food more agreeable, and gold enhances an effect to the eye. But\r\nPlato’s doctrines produce both effects. For as we listen to them they give\r\nmore pleasure than salt to the sense, and they have a wonderful power of\r\nsweetly nourishing and cleansing the soul. So that I must not hesitate or\r\nbe cautious of criticism if someone reproaches me with being insatiable\r\nand grasping at everything, like persons at a banquet who, in their greed\r\nto taste every dish, cannot keep their hands from what is set before\r\nthem.(322) For something of this sort seems to happen in my case when, in\r\nthe same breath, I utter panegyric and philosophic theories, and, before I\r\nhave done justice to my original theme, break off in the middle to expound\r\nthe sayings of philosophers. I have had occasion before now to reply to\r\nthose who make such criticisms as these, and perhaps I shall have to do so\r\nagain.)\r\n\r\nΝῦν δὲ τὸ συνεχὲς ἀποδόντες τῷ παρόντι λόγῳ ἐπὶ τὸν ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐπανάγωμεν\r\nὥσπερ οἱ προεκθέοντες ἐν τοῖς δρόμοις. ἐλέγετο δ᾽ οὖν ἐν τοῖς πρόσθεν ὡς\r\nαὐτὸν μέν τινά φησι Πλάτων τὸν νοῦν καὶ τὴν ψυχήν, [70] αὐτοῦ δὲ τὸ σῶμα\r\nκαὶ τὴν κτῆσιν. ταῦτα δὲ ἐν τοῖς θαυμασίοις διώρισται νόμοις. ὥσπερ οὖν,\r\nεἴ τις ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἀναλαβὼν λέγοι· “Ὅτῳ ἀνδρὶ ἐς νοῦν καὶ φρόνησιν ἀνήρτηται\r\nπάντα τὰ ἐς εὐδαιμονίαν φέροντα καὶ μὴ ἐν τοῖς ἐκτός, ἐξ ὧν εὖ ἢ κακῶς\r\nπραξάντων ἢ καὶ πασχόντων πλανᾶσθαι ἀναγκάζεται, τούτῳ ἄριστα\r\nπαρεσκεύασται πρὸς τὸ ζῆν,” οὐ παρατρέπει τὴν λέξιν οὐδὲ παραποιεῖ,\r\nἐξηγεῖται δὲ ὀρθῶς καὶ ἑρμηνεύει· [B] οὕτω δὲ καὶ ὅστις ἀντὶ τῆς αὐτοῦ\r\nλέξεως τὸν θεὸν παραλαμβάνει οὐκ ἀδικεῖ. εἰ γὰρ τὸν ἐν ἡμῖν δαίμονα, ὄντα\r\nμὲν ἀπαθῆ τῇ φύσει καὶ θεῷ ξυγγενῆ, πολλὰ δὲ ἀνατλάντα καὶ ὑπομείναντα διὰ\r\nτὴν πρὸς τὸ σῶμα κοινωνίαν καὶ τοῦ πάσχειν τε καὶ φθείρεσθαι φαντασίαν\r\nτοῖς πολλοῖς(323) παρασχόντα, τοῦ παντὸς ἐκεῖνος προïσταται βίου τῷ γε\r\nεὐδαιμονήσειν μέλλοντι, τί χρὴ προσδοκᾶν αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ τοῦ καθαροῦ καὶ\r\nἀμιγοῦς γηίνῳ σώματι διανοηθῆναι νοῦ, [C] ὅν δὴ καὶ θεὸν εἶναί φαμεν καὶ\r\nαὐτῷ τὰς ἡνίας ἐπιτρέπειν τοῦ βίου χρῆναι παραινοῦμεν πάντα ἰδιώτην\r\nτε(324) καὶ βασιλέα, τόν γε ὡς ἀληθῶς ἄξιον τῆς ἐπικλήσεως καὺ οὐ νόθον\r\nοὐδὲ ψευδώνυμον, συνιέντα μὲν αὐτοῦ καὶ αἰσθανόμενον διὰ συγγένειαν,\r\nὑφιέμενον δὲ αὐτῷ τῆς ἀρχῆς καὶ ὑποχωροῦντα τῆς ἐπιμελείας ὡς ἔμφρονα;\r\nἀνόητον γὰρ καὶ μάλα αὔθαδες τὸ μὴ καθάπαξ ἐς δύναμιν πείθεσθαι [D] τῷ θεῷ\r\nἀρετῆς ἐπιμελομένους· τούτῳ γὰρ μάλιστα χαίρειν ὑποληπτέον τὸν θεόν. οὐ\r\nμὴν οὐδὲ τῆς ἐννόμου θεραπείας ἀποστατέον οὐδὲ τὴν τοιαύτην τιμὴν\r\nὑπεροπτέον τοῦ κρείττονος, θετέον δὲ ἐν ἀρετῆς μοίρᾳ τὴν εὐσέβειαν τὴν\r\nκρατίστην. ἔστι γὰρ ὁσιότης τῆς δικαιοσύνης ἔκγονος· αὕτη δὲ ὅτι τοῦ\r\nθειοτέρου ψυχῆς εἴδους ἐστίν, οὐδένα λέληθε τῶν ὅσοι τὰ τοιαῦτα\r\nμεταχειρίζονται.\r\n\r\n(I will now, however, resume the thread of my discourse and go back to my\r\nstarting‐point, like those who, when a race is being started, run ahead\r\nout of the line. Well, I was saying, a moment ago, that Plato declares\r\nthat a man’s real self is his mind and soul, whereas his body and his\r\nestate are but his possessions. This is the distinction made in that\r\nmarvellous work, the Laws. And so if one were to go back to the beginning\r\nand say “That man is best equipped for life who makes everything that\r\nrelates to happiness depend on his mind and intelligence and not on those\r\noutside himself who, by doing or faring well or ill force him out of the\r\nstraight path,” he is not changing or perverting the sense of the words,\r\nbut expounds and interprets them correctly. And if for Plato’s word\r\n“genius”(325) he substitutes the word “God” he has a perfect right to do\r\nso. For if Plato gives the control of our whole life to the presiding\r\n“genius” within us which is by nature unaffected by sensation and akin to\r\nGod, but must endure and suffer much because of its association with the\r\nbody, and therefore gives the impression to the crowd that it also is\r\nsubject to sensation and death; and if he says that this is true of every\r\nman who wishes to be happy, what must we suppose is his opinion about pure\r\nintelligence unmixed with earthly substance, which is indeed synonymous\r\nwith God? To this I say every man, whether he be a private citizen or a\r\nking, ought to entrust the reins of his life, and by a king I mean one who\r\nis really worthy of the name, and not counterfeit or falsely so called,\r\nbut one who is aware of God and discerns his nature because of his\r\naffinity with him, and being truly wise bows to the divine authority and\r\nyields the supremacy to God. For it is senseless and arrogant indeed for\r\nthose who cultivate virtue not to submit to God once and for all, as far\r\nas possible. For we must believe that this above all else is what God\r\napproves. Again, no man must neglect the traditional form of worship or\r\nlightly regard this method of paying honour to the higher power, but\r\nrather consider that to be virtuous is to be scrupulously devout. For\r\nPiety is the child of Justice, and that justice is a characteristic of the\r\nmore divine type of soul is obvious to all who discuss such matters.)\r\n\r\nΤαῦτά τοι καὶ ἐπαινοῦμεν τὸν Ἕκτορα σπένδειν μὲν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα διὰ τὸν ἐπὶ\r\nτῶν χειρῶν λύθρον· [71] ἠξιοῦμεν δὲ μηδὲ ἐς ἄστυ ἰίναι μηδὲ ἀπολείπειν τὴν\r\nμάχην μέλλοντά γε οὐ στρατηγοῦ καὶ βασιλέως ἐπιτελεῖν ἔργον, διακόνου δὲ\r\nκαὶ ὑπηρέτου, Ἰδαίου τινὸς ἢ Ταλθυβίου τάξιν ἀναληψόμενον. ἀλλ᾽ ἔοικε γάρ,\r\nὅπερ ἔφαμεν ἐξ ἀρχῆς, πρόφασις εὐπρεπὴς(326) εἶναι φυγῆς τοῦτο. καὶ γὰρ\r\nὁπότε τῷ Τελαμωνίῳ ξυνίστατο πεισθεὶς τῷ φήμῃ τοῦ μάντεως, ἀσπασίως\r\nδιελύθη καὶ ἔδωκε δῶρα, τὸν θάνατον ἐκφυγὼν ἄσμενος·(327) [B] καθόλου δὲ\r\nεἰπεῖν, φεύγουσιν ἕπεται θρασέως, αἴτιος δέ ἐστιν οὐδαμοῦ νίκης καὶ\r\nτροπῆς, πλὴν ὅτε\r\n\r\n(For this reason, then, while I applaud Hector for refusing to make a\r\nlibation because of the blood‐stains on his hands, he had, as I said, no\r\nright to go back to the city or forsake the battle, seeing that the task\r\nhe was about to perform was not that of a general or of a king, but of a\r\nmessenger and underling, and that he was ready to take on himself the\r\noffice of an Idaeus or Talthybius. However, as I said at first, this seems\r\nto have been simply a specious excuse for flight. And indeed when he\r\nobeyed the bidding of the seer and fought a duel with the son of\r\nTelamon,(328) he was very ready to make terms and to give presents, and\r\nrejoiced to have escaped death. In short, as a rule, he is brave when in\r\npursuit of the retreating foe, but in no case has he the credit of a\r\nvictory or of turning the tide of battle, except when)\r\n\r\n\r\n    πρῶτος ἐσήλατο τεῖχος Ἀχαιῶν\r\n\r\n    (“He was the first to leap within the wall of the Achaeans”(329))\r\n\r\n\r\nξὺν τῷ Σαρπηδόνι. πότερον οὖν ὡς οὐκ ἔχοντες τηλικοῦτον ἔργον βασιλέως\r\nεὐλαβησόμεθα τὸν ἀγῶνα, μή ποτε ἄρα μικρὰ μεγάλοις καὶ φαῦλα σπουδῆς\r\nἀξίοις μείζονος παρατιθέναι δόζωμεν, [C] ἢ τολμήσομεν καὶ πρὸς τηλικοῦτον\r\nἔργον ἁμιλλᾶσθαι; οὐκοῦν ἐκεῖνο μὲν ἦν τὸ τεῖχος ὑπὲρ τῆς ᾐόνος, ἐν οὐδὲ\r\nὅλῳ τῷ πρὸ μεσημβρίας χρόνῳ συντελεσθέν, ὁποίους ἡμῖν τοὺς χάρακας ἔννομον\r\nκατασκευάζεσθαι· τὸ δὲ ὑπὲρ τῶν Ἄλπεων τεῖχος παλαιόν τε ἦν φρούριον, καὶ\r\nαὐτῷ χρῆται μετὰ τὴν φυγὴν ὁ τύραννος, ὥσπερ ἔρυμά τι νεουργὲς ἀποφήνας\r\nκαὶ ἀξιόλογον φρουρὰν ἀπολιπὼν ἐρρωμένων ἀνδρῶν.

But the wall\r\nthat was on the Alps was an ancient fort, and the usurper used it after\r\nhis flight, converting it into a defence as strong as though it had been\r\nnewly built, and he left there an ample garrison of seasoned troops. But\r\nhe did not himself march all the way there, but remained in the\r\nneighbouring city.(331) This is a trading centre of the Italians on the\r\ncoast, very prosperous and teeming with wealth, since the Mysians and\r\nPaeonians and all the Italian inhabitants of the interior procure their\r\nmerchandise thence. These last used, I think, to be called Heneti in the\r\npast, but now that the Romans are in possession of these cities they\r\npreserve the original name, but make the trifling addition of one letter\r\nat the beginning of the word. Its sign is a single character(332) and they\r\ncall it “oo,” and they often use it instead of “b,” to serve, I suppose,\r\nas a sort of breathing, and to represent some peculiarity of their\r\npronunciation. The nation as a whole is called by this name, but at the\r\ntime of the founding of the city an eagle from Zeus flew past on the\r\nright, and so bestowed on the place the omen derived from the bird.(333)\r\nIt is situated at the foot of the Alps, which are very high mountains with\r\nprecipices in them, and they hardly allow room for those who are trying to\r\nforce their way over the passes to use even a single waggon and a pair of\r\nmules. They begin at the sea which we call Ionian, and form a barrier\r\nbetween what is now Italy and the Illyrians and Galatians, and extend as\r\nfar as the Etruscan sea. For when the Romans conquered the whole of this\r\ncountry, which includes the tribe of the Heneti and some of the Ligurians\r\nand a considerable number of Galatians besides, they did not hinder them\r\nfrom retaining their ancient names, but compelled them to acknowledge the\r\ndominion of the Italian republic. And, in our day, all the territory that\r\nlies within the Alps and is bounded by the Ionian and the Etruscan seas\r\nhas the honour of being called Italy. On the other side of the Alps, on\r\nthe west, dwell the Galatians, and the Rhaetians to the north where the\r\nRhine and the Danube have their sources hard by in the neighbouring\r\ncountry of the barbarians. And on the east, as I said, the Alps fortify\r\nthe district where the usurper stationed his garrison. In this way, then,\r\nItaly is contained on all sides, partly by mountains that are very hard to\r\ncross, partly by a shallow sea into which countless streams empty and form\r\na morass like the marshlands of Egypt. But the Emperor by his skill gained\r\ncontrol of the whole of that boundary of the sea, and forced his way\r\ninland.)\r\n\r\nΚαὶ ἵνα μὴ διατρίβειν δοκῶ αὖθίς τε ὑπὲρ τῶν δυσχωριῶν διαλεγόμενος, καὶ\r\nὡς οὔτε στρατόπεδον ἦν οὐδὲ χάρακα πλησίον καταβαλέσθαι, οὔτε ἐπάγειν\r\nμηχανὰς καὶ ἑλεπόλεις, ἀνύδρου δεινῶς ὄντος καὶ οὐδὲ μικρὰς λιβάδας\r\nἔχοντος [73] τοῦ πέριξ χωρίου, ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν εἶμι τὴν αἵρεσιν. καὶ εἰ βούλεσθε\r\nτὸ κεφάλαιον ἀθρόως ἑλεῖν τοῦ λόγου, ὑπομνήσθητε τῆς τοῦ Μακεδόνος ἐπὶ\r\nτοὺς Ἰνδοὺς πορείας, οἳ τὴν πέτραν ἐκείνην κατῴκουν, ἐφ᾽ ἣν οὐδὲ τῶν\r\nὀρνίθων ἦν τοῖς κουφοτάτοις ἀναπτῆναι, ὅπως ἑάλω, καὶ οὐδὲν πλέον ἀκούειν\r\nἐπιθυμήσετε· πλὴν τοσοῦτον μόνον, ὅτι Ἀλέξανδρος μὲν ἀπέβαλε πολλοὺς\r\nΜακεδόνας ἐξελὼν τὴν πέτραν, ὁ δὲ ἡμέτερος ἄρχων καὶ στρατηγὸς οὐδὲ\r\nχιλίαρχον ἀποβαλὼν ἢ λοχαγόν τινα, [B] ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ ὁπλίτην τῶν ἐκ καταλόγου,\r\nκαθαρὰν καὶ ἄδακρυν περιεποιήσατο τὴν νίκην.

And if you wish to grasp the main point of my narrative in a\r\nfew words, remember the Macedonian’s(337) expedition against those Indians\r\nwho lived on the famous rock(338) up to which not even the lightest birds\r\ncould wing their flight, and how he took it by storm, and you will be\r\ncontent to hear no more from me. However I will add this merely, that\r\nAlexander in storming the rock lost many of his Macedonians, whereas our\r\nruler and general lost not a single chiliarch or a captain, nay not even a\r\nlegionary from the muster‐roll, but achieved an unsullied and\r\n“tearless”(339) victory. Now Hector and Sarpedon, no doubt, hurled down\r\nmany men from the wall, but when they encountered Patroclus in all his\r\nglory Sarpedon was slain near the ships, while Hector, to his shame, fled\r\nwithout even recovering the body of his friend. Thus without intelligence\r\nand emboldened by mere physical strength they ventured to attack the wall.\r\nBut the Emperor, when strength and daring are required, employs force of\r\narms and good counsel together, and so wins the day, but where good\r\njudgment alone is necessary it is by this that he steers his course, and\r\nthus achieves triumphs such as not even iron could ever avail to\r\nerase.(340))\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἐπειδὴ καθ᾽ αὑτὸν ὁ λόγος φερόμενος ἥκει πάλαι ποθῶν τὴν ξύνεσιν\r\nἐπαινεῖν καὶ τὴν εὐβουλίαν, ἀποδοτέον. καὶ ὑπὲρ τούτων ὀλίγα πάλαι(341)\r\nδιεληλύθαμεν· ὁπόσα δὲ ἡμῖν ἐφαίνετο [D] πρὸς τὰ τῶν ἡρώων ἐκείνων ἔχειν\r\nξυγγένειαν, μεγάλα μικροῖς εἰκάζοντες, δι᾽ ὁμοιότητα διήλθομεν.(342) δῆλον\r\nδὲ ἀποβλέψαντι πρὸς τὸ τῆς παρασκευῆς μέγεθος καὶ τῆς δυνάμενως τὴν\r\nπεριουσίαν. τότε γὰρ ἥ τε Ἑλλὰς ἐκεκίνητο ξύμπασα καὶ Θρᾳκῶν μοῖρα καὶ\r\nΠαιόνων τό τε τοῦ Πριάμου ξύμπαν ὑπήκοον,\r\n\r\n(But since my speech has of its own accord reached this point in its\r\ncourse and has long been eager to praise the Emperor’s wisdom and wise\r\ncounsel, I allow it to do so. And in fact I spoke briefly on this subject\r\nsome time ago, and all the cases where there seemed to me to be any\r\naffinity between the heroes of Homer and the Emperor, I described because\r\nof that resemblance, comparing great things with small. And indeed if one\r\nconsiders the size of their armaments, the superiority of his forces also\r\nbecomes evident. For in those days all Greece was set in motion,(343) and\r\npart of Thrace and Paeonia, and all the subject allies of Priam,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ὅσσον Λέσβος ἔσω Μάκαρος ἕδος ἐντὸς ἐέργει\r\n    Καὶ Φρυγίη καθύπερθε καὶ Ἑλλήσποντος ἀπείρων.\r\n\r\n    (“All that Lesbos, the seat of Makar, contains within, and Phrygia\r\n    on the north and the boundless Hellespont.”(344))\r\n\r\n\r\n[74] τὰ δὲ νῦν ἔθνη συνιόντα βασιλεῖ καὶ συμπολεμοῦντα τὸν πόλεμον καὶ\r\nτοὺς ἀντιταξαμένους καταριθμεῖν μὴ λῆρος ᾖ καὶ φλυαρία περιττὴ καὶ λίαν\r\nἀρχαῖον.(345) ὅσῳ δὲ μείζους αἱ συνιοῦσαι δυνάμεις, τοσούτῳ τὰ ἔργα\r\nπροφέρειν εἰκός· ὥστε ἀνάγκη καὶ ταῦτα ἐκείνων ὑπεραίρειν. πλήθει γε μὴν\r\nποῦ ποτε ἄξιον συμβαλεῖν; οἱ μὲν γὰρ περὶ μιᾶς ἐμάχοντο πόλεως ξυνεχῶς,\r\nκαὶ οὔτε Τρῶες(346) ἀπελάσαι τοὺς Ἀχαιοὺς ἐπικρατοῦντες ἠδύναντο, οὔτε\r\nἐκεῖνοι νικῶντες ἐξελεῖν καὶ ἀνατρέψαι τῶν Πριαμιδῶν τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ τὴν\r\nβασιλείαν ἴσχυον, δεκαέτης δὲ αὐτοῖς ἀναλώθη χρόνος.

And it is natural that, in proportion as\r\nthe armies are larger, their achievements are more important. So it\r\nfollows of necessity that, in this respect as well, the Emperor’s army\r\nsurpassed Homer’s heroes. In mere numbers, at any rate, at what point, I\r\nask, could one justly compare them? For the Greeks fought all along for a\r\nsingle city and the Trojans when they prevailed were not able to drive\r\naway the Greeks, nor were the Greeks strong enough, when they won a\r\nvictory, to destroy and overthrow the power and the royal sway of the\r\nhouse of Priam, and yet the time they spent over it was ten years long.\r\nBut the Emperor’s wars and undertakings have been numerous. He has been\r\ndescribed as waging war against the Germans across the Rhine, and then\r\nthere was his bridge of boats over the Tigris, and his exposure of the\r\npower and arrogance of the Parthians(348) was no trivial thing, on that\r\noccasion when they did not venture to defend their country while he was\r\nlaying it waste, but had to look on while the whole of it was devastated\r\nbetween the Tigris and the Lycus. Then, when the war against the usurper\r\nwas concluded, there followed the expeditions to Sicily and Carthage, and\r\nthat stratagem of occupying beforehand the mouth of the Po, which deprived\r\nthe usurper of all his forces in Italy, and finally that third and last\r\nfall(349) at the Cottian Alps, which secured for the Emperor the pleasure\r\nof a victory that was sure, and carried with it no fears for the future,\r\nwhile it compelled the defeated man to inflict on himself a just penalty\r\nwholly worthy of his misdeeds.)\r\n\r\nΤοσαῦτα ὑπὲρ τῶν βασιλέως ἔργων ἐν βραχεῖ διεληλύθαμεν, οὔτε κολακείᾳ\r\nπροστιθέντες καὶ αὔξειν ἐπιχειροῦντες τυχὸν οὐδενὸς διαφέροντα τῶν ἄλλων,\r\nοὔτε πόρρωθεν ἕλκοντες καὶ βιαζόμενοι τῶν ἔργων τὰς ὁμοιότητας, καθάπερ οἱ\r\nτοὺς μύθους ἐξηγούμενοι τῶν ποιητῶν καὶ ἀναλύοντες ἐς λόγους πιθανοὺς καὶ\r\nἐνδεχομένους τὰ πλάσματα ἐκ μικρᾶς πάνυ τῆς ὑπονοίας ὁρμώμενοι [75] καὶ\r\nἀμυδρὰς λίαν παραλαβόντες τὰς ἀρχὰς πειρῶνται ξυμπείθειν, ὡς δὴ ταῦτα γε\r\nαὐτὰ ἐκείνων ἐθελόντων λέγειν. ἐνταῦθα δὲ εἴ τις ἐξέλοι τῶν Ὁμήρου μόνον\r\nτὰ τῶν ἡρώων ὀνόματα, ἐνθείη δὲ τὸ βασιλέως καὶ ἐναρμόσειεν, οὐ μᾶλλον εἰς\r\nἐκείνους ἢ τοῦτον πεποιῆσθαι δόξει τὰ(350) τῆς Ἰλιάδος ἔπη.\r\n\r\n(I have given this brief account of the Emperor’s achievements, not adding\r\nanything in flattery and trying to exaggerate things that are perhaps of\r\nno special importance, nor dragging in what is far‐fetched and unduly\r\npressing points of resemblance with those achievements, like those who\r\ninterpret the myths of the poets and analyse them into plausible versions\r\nwhich allow them to introduce fictions of their own, though they start out\r\nfrom very slight analogies, and having recourse to a very shadowy basis,\r\ntry to convince us that this is the very thing that the poets intended to\r\nsay. But in this case if anyone should take out of Homer’s poems merely\r\nthe names of the heroes, and insert and fit in the Emperor’s, the epic of\r\nthe Iliad would be seen to have been composed quite as much in his honour\r\nas in theirs.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ὅπως μὴ τὰ ὑπὲρ τῶν ἔργων μόνον ἀκούοντες τὰ τῶν κατορθωμάτων\r\nτῶν(351) ἐς τὸν πόλεμον ἔλαττον [B] ἔχειν ὑπολαμβάνητε βασιλέα περὶ τὰ\r\nσεμνότερα καὶ ὧν ἄξιον μείζονα ποιεῖσθαι λόγον, δημηγοριῶν φημι καὶ\r\nξυμβουλιῶν, καὶ ὁπόσα γνώμη μετὰ νοῦ καὶ φρονήσεως κατευθύνει, ἀθρεῖτε ἐν\r\nὈδυσσεῖ καὶ Νέστορι τοῖς ἐπαινουμένοις κατὰ τὴν ποίησιν, καὶ ἤν τι μεῖον\r\nἐν βασιλεῖ καταμανθάνητε, τοῖς ἐπαινέταις τοῦτο λογίζεσθε, πλέον δὲ ἔχοντα\r\nδικαίως ἂν(352) αὐτὸν μᾶλλον ἀποδεχοίμεθα. οὐκοῦν ὁ μέν, ὁπηνίκα\r\nχαλεπαίνειν καὶ στασιάζειν ἤρχοντο περὶ τῆς αἰχμαλώτου κόρης, λέγειν\r\nἐπιχειρῶν οὕτω δή τι πείθει τὸν βασιλέα καὶ τὸν τῆς Θέτιδος, [C] ὥστε ὁ\r\nμὲν ἀκόσμος διέλυσε τὸν ξύλλογον, ὁ δὲ οὐδὲ περιμείνας ἀφοσιώσασθαι τὰ\r\nπρὸς τὸν θεόν, ἔτι δὲ αὐτὰ δρῶν καὶ ἀφορῶν ἐς τὴν θεωρίδα, στέλλει τοὺς\r\nκήρυκας ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀχιλλέως σκηνὴν, ὥσπερ οἶμαι δεδιὼς μὴ τῆς ὀργῆς\r\nἐπιλαθόμενος καὶ ἀπαλλαγεὶς τοῦ πάθους μεταγνοίη καὶ ἀποφύγοι τὴν\r\nἁμαρτάδα· ὁ δὲ ἐκ τῆς Ἰθάκης ῥήτωρ πολύτροπος πείθειν ἐπιχειρῶν πρὸς\r\nδιαλλαγὰς Ἀχιλλέα καὶ δῶρα πολλὰ διδούς, [D] μυρία δὲ ἐπαγγελλόμενος, οὕτω\r\nτὸν νεανίσκον παρώξυνεν, ὥστε πρότερον οὐ(353) βουλευσάμενον τὸν ἀπόπλουν\r\nνῦν(354) παρασκευάζεσθαι. ἔστι δὲ αὐτῶν τὰ θαυμαστὰ τῆς συνέσεως δείγματα\r\nαἵ τε ἐπὶ τὸν πόλεμον παρακλήσεις καὶ ἡ τειχοποιία τοῦ Νέστορος,\r\nπρεσβυτικὸν λίαν καὶ ἄτολμον ἐπινόημα. οὔκουν οὐδὲ ὄφελος ἦν πολὺ τοῖς\r\nἈχαιοῖς τοῦ μηχανήματος· [76] ἀλλὰ ἡττῶντον τῶν Τρώων τὸ τεῖχος\r\nἐπιτελέσαντες, καὶ μάλα εἰκότως. τότε μὲν γὰρ αὐτοὶ τῶν νεῶν ᾤοντο\r\nπροβεβλῆσθαι καθάπερ ἔρυμα γενναῖον· ἐπεὶ δὲ ᾔσθοντο σφῶν(355) προκείμενον\r\nκαὶ ἀποικοδομούμενον(356) τεῖχος τάφρῳ βαθείᾳ καὶ πασσάλοις ὀξέσι\r\nδιηλούμενον,(357) κατερρᾳθύμουν καὶ ὑφίεντο τῆς ἀλκῆς τῷ τειχίσματι\r\nπεποιθότες. ἀλλ᾽ οὐ γὰρ εἴ τις ἐκείνοις μέμφοιτο καὶ ἐπιδεικνύοι\r\nδιαμαρτάνοντας, οὗτός ἐστι βασιλέως ἀξιόχρεως ἐπαινέτης· ὅστις δὲ οἶμαι\r\nτῶν ἔργων ἀξίως μνησθείη, [B] οὐ μάτην οὐδὲ αὐτομάτως οὐδὲ ἀλόγῳ φορᾷ\r\nγενομένων, προβουλευθέντων δὲ ὀρθῶς καὶ διοικηθέντων, οὗτος ἀρκούντως\r\nἐπαινεῖ τὴν βασιλέως ἀγχίνοιαν.\r\n\r\n(But that you may not think, if you hear only about his achievements and\r\nsuccesses in war, that the Emperor is less well endowed for pursuits that\r\nare loftier and rightly considered of more importance, I mean public\r\nspeaking and deliberations and all those affairs in which judgment\r\ncombined with intelligence and prudence take the helm, consider the case\r\nof Odysseus and Nestor, who are so highly praised in the poem; and if you\r\nfind that the Emperor is inferior to them in any respect, put that down to\r\nhis panegyrists, but we should rather in fairness concede that he is far\r\nsuperior. Nestor, for instance, when they began to disagree and quarrel\r\nabout the captive damsel,(358) tried to address them, and he did persuade\r\nthe king and the son of Thetis, but only to this extent that Achilles\r\nbroke up the assembly in disorder, while Agamemnon did not even wait to\r\ncomplete his expiation to the god, but while he was still performing the\r\nrite and the sacred ship was in view, he sent heralds to the tent of\r\nAchilles, just as though, it seems to me, he were afraid that he would\r\nforget his anger, and, once free from that passion, would repent and avoid\r\nhis error. Again, the far‐travelled orator from Ithaca, when he tried to\r\npersuade Achilles to make peace, and offered him many gifts and promised\r\nhim countless others, so provoked the young warrior that, though he had\r\nnot before planned to sail home, he now began to make preparations.(359)\r\nThen there are those wonderful proofs of their intelligence, their\r\nexhortations to battle and Nestor’s building of the wall, a cowardly\r\nnotion and worthy indeed of an old man. Nor in truth did the Achaeans\r\nbenefit much from that device. For it was after they had finished the wall\r\nthat they were worsted by the Trojans, and naturally enough. For before\r\nthat, they thought that they were themselves protecting the ships, like a\r\nnoble bulwark. But when they realised that a wall lay in front of them,\r\nbuilt with a deep moat and set at intervals with sharp stakes, they grew\r\ncareless and slackened their valour, because they trusted to the\r\nfortification. Yet it is not anyone who blames them and shows that they\r\nwere in the wrong who is therefore a fit and proper person to praise the\r\nEmperor. But he who, in a worthy manner, recounts the Emperor’s deeds,\r\nwhich were done not idly or automatically, or from an irrational impulse,\r\nbut were skilfully planned beforehand and carried through, he alone\r\npraises adequately the Emperor’s keen intelligence.)\r\n\r\nΤὸ δὲ ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστῃ συνόδῳ τὰς δημηγορίας ἐκλέγειν τὰς(360) ἐς τὰ στρατόπεδα\r\nκαὶ δήμους καὶ βουλευτήρια μακροτέρας δεῖται τῆς ξυγγραφῆς. ἑνὸς δὲ ἴσως\r\nἐπακούειν οὐ χαλεπόν. καί μοι πάλιν ἐννοήσατε τὸν Λαέρτου, ὁπότε\r\nὡρμημένους ἐκπλεῖν τοὺς Ἕλληνας ἐπέχει τῆς ὁρμῆς [C] καὶ ἐς τὸν πόλεμον\r\nμετατίθησι τὴν προθυμίαν, καὶ(361) βασιλέως τὸν ἐν Ἰλλυριοῖς ξύλλογον, ἵνα\r\nδὴ πρεσβύτης ἀνὴρ ὑπὸ μειρακίων παιδικὰ φρονεῖν ἀναπειθόμενος ὁμολογιῶν\r\nἐπελανθάνετο καὶ πίστεων, καὶ τῷ μὲν σωτῆρι καὶ εὐεργέτῃ δυσμενὴς ἦν,\r\nσπονδὰς δὲ ἐποιεῖτο πρὸς ὃν ἦν ἄσπονδος καὶ ἀκήρυκτος βασιλεῖ πόλεμος,\r\nστρατόν τε ἤγειρε καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς [D] ὁρίοις ἀπήντα τῆς χώρας, κωλῦσαι τοῦ\r\nπρόσω χωρεῖν ἐπιθυμῶν. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐς ταὐτὸν ἦλθον ἀμφοτέρω τὼ στρατεύματε καὶ\r\nἐχρῆν ἐπὶ τῶν ὁπλιτῶν ποιεῖσθαι τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, βῆμά τε ὑψηλὸν ᾔρετο καὶ\r\nαὐτὸ περιέσχεν ὁπλιτῶν δῆμος καὶ ἀκοντιστῶν καὶ τοξοτῶν ἱππεῖς τε\r\nἐνσκευασάμενοι τοὺς ἵππους καὶ τὰ σημεῖα τῶν τάξεων· ἀνῄει τε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ\r\nβασιλεὺς μετὰ τοῦ τέως ξυνάρχοντος οὔτε αἰχμὴν φέρων οὔτε ἀσπίδα [77] καὶ\r\nκράνος, ἀλλὰ ἐσθῆτα τὴν συνήθη. καὶ οὐδὲ αὐτῷ τις τῶν δορυφόρων εἵπετο,\r\nμόνος δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος εἱστήκει πεποιθὼς τῷ λόγῳ σεμνῶς ἡρμοσμένῳ.\r\nἐργάτης γάρ ἐστι καὶ τούτων ἀγαθός, οὐκ ἀποσμιλεύων οὐδὲ ἀπονυχίζων τὰ\r\nῥήματα οὐδὲ ἀποτορνεύων τὰς περιόδους καθάπερ οἱ κομψοὶ ῥήτορες, σεμνὸς δὲ\r\nἅμα καὶ καθαρὸς καὶ τοῖς ὀνόμασι ξὺν καιρῷ χρώμενος, ὥστε ἐνδύεσθαι ταῖς\r\nψυχαῖς [B] οὐ τῶν παιδείας καὶ ξυνέσεως μεταποιουμένων μόνον, ἀλλ᾽ ἤδη καὶ\r\nτῶν ἰδιωτῶν ξυνιέναι πολλοὺς καὶ ἐπαïειν τῶν ῥημάτων. οὐκοῦν ᾕρει μυριάδας\r\nὁπλιτῶν συχνὰς καὶ χιλιάδας ἱππέων εἴκοσι καὶ ἔθνη μαχιμώτατα(362) καὶ\r\nχώραν πάμφορον, οὐ βίᾳ ἕλκων οὐδὲ αἰχμαλώτους ἄγων, ἑκόντας δὲ αὐτῷ\r\nπειθομένους καὶ τὸ ἐπιταττόμενον ποιεῖν ἐθέλοντας. ταύτην ἐγὼ τὴν νίκην\r\nκρίνω τῆς Λακωνικῆς ἐκείνης(363) μακρῷ σεμνοτέραν· ἡ μέν γε ἦν ἄδακρυς\r\nμόνοις(364) τοῖς κρατοῦσιν, [C] ἡ δὲ οὐδὲ τοῖς κρατηθεῖσιν ἤνεγκε δάκρυα,\r\nἀλλ᾽ ἀπὸ τοῦ βήματος κατῆλθεν ὁ τῆς βασιλείας ὑποκριτὴς δικασάμενος καὶ\r\nὥσπερ ὄφλημα βασιλεῖ πατρῷον ἀποδοὺς τὴν ἁλουργίδα· τἆλλα δὲ αὐτῷ δίδωσι\r\nβασιλεὺς ἄφθονα μᾶλλον ἢ Κῦρόν φασι παρασχεῖν τῷ πάππῳ, ζῆν τε ἐποίησε καὶ\r\nδιαιτᾶσθαι καθάπερ Ὅμηρος ἀξιοῖ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τοὺς ἀφηλικεστέρους,\r\n\r\n(But to report to you those speeches which he made at every public\r\ngathering to the armies and the common people and the councils, demands\r\ntoo long a narrative, though it is perhaps not too much to ask you to hear\r\nabout one of these. Pray then think once more of the son of Laertes when\r\nthe Greeks were rushing to set sail and he checked the rush and diverted\r\ntheir zeal back to the war,(365) and then of the Emperor’s assembly in\r\nIllyria, when that old man,(366) persuaded by mere youths to think\r\nchildish thoughts, forgot his treaties and obligations and proved to be\r\nthe enemy of his preserver and benefactor, and came to terms with one\r\nagainst whom the Emperor was waging a war that allowed no truce nor herald\r\nof a truce,(367) and who was not only getting an army together, but came\r\nto meet the Emperor on the border of the country, because he was anxious\r\nto hinder him from advancing further. And when those two armies met, and\r\nit was necessary to hold an assembly in the presence of the hoplites, a\r\nhigh platform was set up and it was surrounded by a crowd of hoplites,\r\njavelin‐men and archers and cavalry equipped with their horses and the\r\nstandards of the divisions. Then the Emperor, accompanied by him who for\r\nthe moment was his colleague, mounted the platform, carrying no sword or\r\nshield or helmet, but wearing his usual dress. And not even one of his\r\nbodyguard followed him, but there he stood alone on the platform, trusting\r\nto that speech which was so impressively appropriate. For of speeches too\r\nhe is a good craftsman, though he does not plane down and polish his\r\nphrases nor elaborate his periods like the ingenious rhetoricians, but is\r\nat once dignified and simple, and uses the right words on every occasion,\r\nso that they sink into the souls not only of those who claim to be\r\ncultured and intelligent, but many unlearned persons too understand and\r\ngive hearing to his words. And so he won over many tens of thousands of\r\nhoplites and twenty thousand cavalry and most warlike nations, and at the\r\nsame time a country that is extremely fertile, not seizing it by force, or\r\ncarrying off captives, but by winning over men who obeyed him of their own\r\nfree will and were eager to carry out his orders. This victory I judge to\r\nbe far more splendid than that for which Sparta is famous.(368) For that\r\nwas “tearless” for the victors only, but the Emperor’s did not cause even\r\nthe defeated to shed tears, but he who was masquerading as Emperor came\r\ndown from the platform when he had pleaded his cause, and handed over to\r\nthe Emperor the imperial purple(369) as though it were an ancestral debt.\r\nAnd all else the Emperor gave him in abundance, more than they say Cyrus\r\ngave to his grandfather, and arranged that he should live and be\r\nmaintained in the manner that Homer recommends for men who are past their\r\nprime:—)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Τοιούτῳ γὰρ ἔοικεν, ἐπεὶ λούσαιτο φάγοι τε,\r\n    Εὐδέμεναι μαλακῶς· [D] ἣ γὰρ δίκη ἐστὶ γερόντων.\r\n\r\n    (“For it is fitting that such a one, when he has bathed and fed,\r\n    should sleep soft, for that is the manner of the aged.”(370))\r\n\r\n\r\nτὸ μὲν οὖν ἐμὸν ἡδέως ἂν τοὺς ῥηθέντας λόγους διεξῆλθον, καὶ οὐκ ἄν με\r\nὄκνος καταλάβοι οὕτω καλῶν ἁπτόμενον λόγων· αἰδὼς δὲ οἶμαι κατείργει καὶ\r\nοὐκ ἐπιτρέπει μετατιθέναι καὶ ἐξερμηνεύειν ἐς ὑμᾶς τοὺς λόγους. ἀδικοίην\r\nγὰρ ἂν διαφθείρων καὶ ἐλεγχόμενος αἰσχυνοίμην, εἴ τις ἄρα τὸ βασιλέως\r\nἀναγνοὺς ξύγγραμμα ἢ τότε ἀκούσας ἀπομνημονεύοι καὶ ἀπαιτοίη οὐ τὰ νοήματα\r\nμόνον, [78] ὅσαις δὲ ἀρεταῖς ἐκεῖνα κοσμεῖται κατὰ τὴν πάτριον φωνὴν\r\nξυγκείμενα. τοῦτο δὲ οὐκ ἦν Ὁμήρῳ τὸ δέος πολλαῖς μὲν ὕστερον γενεαῖς τοὺς\r\nλόγους διηγουμένῳ, λιπόντων δὲ ἐκείνων οὐδὲν ὑπόμνημα τῶν ἐς τοὺς\r\nξυλλόγους ῥηθέντων, καὶ σαφῶς οἶμαι πιστεύοντι, ὅτι ἄμεινον(371) τἀκείνων\r\nαὐτὸς ἐξαγγελεῖ καὶ διηγήσεται. τὸ δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον μιμεῖσθαι καταγέλαστον\r\nκαὶ οὐκ ἄξιον ἐλευθέρας ψυχῆς καὶ γενναίας. [B] τὰ μὲν δὴ θαυμαστὰ τῶν\r\nἔργων καὶ ὁπόσων ὁ πολὺς ὅμιλος θεατῆς τε ἐγένετο καὶ διασώζει τὴν μνήμην\r\nξὺν εὐφημίᾳ, ἅτε ἐς τὸ(372) τέλος ἀφορῶν καὶ τῶν εὖ ἢ κακῶς ἀποβάντων\r\nκριτὴς καθεστὼς καὶ ἐπαινέτης οὐ μάλα ἀστεῖος, ἀκηκόατε πολλάκις τῶν\r\nμακαρίων σοφιστῶν καὶ τοῦ ποιητικοῦ γένους πρὸς αὐτῶν τῶν μουσῶν\r\nἐπιπνεομένου, ὥστε ὑμᾶς τούτων ἕνεκα καὶ διωχλήκαμεν, μακροτέρους τοὺς\r\nὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ποιούμενοι λόγους· [C] καὶ γάρ ἐστε λίαν αὐτῶν ἤδη διακορεῖς\r\nκαὶ ὑμῶν ἐστι τὰ ὦτα πλήρη, καὶ οὐ μή ποτε ἐπιλίπωσιν οἱ τούτων ποιηταί,\r\nπολέμους ὑμνοῦντες καὶ νίκας ἀνακηρύττοντες λαμπρᾷ τῇ φωνῇ κατὰ τοὺς\r\nὈλυμπίασι κήρυκας· παρέσχεσθε γὰρ ὑμεῖς τῶν ἀνδρῶν τούτων ἀφθονίαν,\r\nἀσμένως ἐπακούοντες. καὶ οὐδὲν θαυμαστόν. εἰσὶ γὰρ αἱ τούτων ὑπολήψεις\r\nἀγαθῶν πέρι καὶ φαύλων ταῖς ὑμετέραις ξυγγενεῖς, [D] καὶ ἀπαγγέλλουσι πρὸς\r\nὑμᾶς τὰ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν διανοήματα, ἃ(373) ὥσπερ ἐσθῆτι ποικίλῃ(374) τοῖς\r\nὀνόμασι σκιαγραφήσαντες καὶ διαπλάσαντες ἡδίστοις ῥυθμοῖς καὶ σχήμασιν ὡς\r\nδή τι καινὸν εὑρόντες εἰς ὑμᾶς φέρουσιν· ὑμεῖς δὲ ἄσμενοι παραδέχεσθε, καὶ\r\nἐκείνους τε οἴεσθε ὀρθῶς ἐπαινεῖν, τούτοις τε ἀποδίδοσθαι τὸ προσῆκόν\r\nφατε. τὸ δὲ ἐστι μὲν ἴσως ἀληθές, τυχὸν δὲ καὶ ἄλλως ἔχει, ἀγνοούμενον\r\nπρὸς ὑμῶν ὅπῃ ποτὲ ἂν ὀρθῶς γίγνοιτο.\r\n\r\n(Now for my part I should have been glad to repeat to you the words that\r\nthe Emperor used, and no fear would overtake me when handling words so\r\nnoble. But modesty restrains me and does not permit me to change or\r\ninterpret his words to you. For it would be wrong of me to tamper with\r\nthem, and I should blush to have my ignorance exposed, if someone who had\r\nread the Emperor’s composition or heard it at the time should remember it\r\nby heart, and demand from me not only the ideas in it but all the\r\nexcellences with which they are adorned, though they are composed in the\r\nlanguage of our ancestors.(375) Now this at any rate Homer had not to fear\r\nwhen, many generations later, he reported his speeches, since his speakers\r\nleft no record of what they said in their assemblies, and I think he was\r\nclearly confident that he was able to relate and report what they said in\r\na better style. But to make an inferior copy is absurd and unworthy of a\r\ngenerous and noble soul. Now as to the marvellous portion of his\r\nachievements and those of which the great multitude was spectator and\r\nhence preserves their memory and commends them, since it looks to the\r\nresult and is there to judge whether they turn out well or ill, and\r\neulogises them in language that is certainly not elegant,—as to all this I\r\nsay you have often heard from the ingenious sophists, and from the race of\r\npoets inspired by the Muses themselves, so that, as far as these are\r\nconcerned, I must have wearied you by speaking about them at too great\r\nlength. For you are already surfeited with them, your ears are filled with\r\nthem, and there will always be a supply of composers of such discourses to\r\nsing of battles and proclaim victories with a loud clear voice, after the\r\nmanner of the heralds at the Olympic games. For you yourselves, since you\r\ndelight to listen to them, have produced an abundance of these men. And no\r\nwonder. For their conceptions of what is good and bad are akin to your\r\nown, and they do but report to you your own opinions and depict them in\r\nfine phrases, like a dress of many colours, and cast them into the mould\r\nof agreeable rhythms and forms, and bring them forth for you as though\r\nthey had invented something new. And you welcome them eagerly, and think\r\nthat this is the correct way to eulogise, and you say that these deeds\r\nhave received their due. And this is perhaps true but it may well be\r\notherwise, since you do not really know what the correct way should be.)\r\n\r\n[79] Ἐπεὶ καὶ τὸν Ἀθηναῖον ἐνενόησα Σωκράτη· ἴστε δὲ ὑμεῖς ἀκοῇ τὸν ἄνδρα\r\nκαὶ τὸ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ κλέος τῆς σοφίας παρὰ τῆς Πυθίας ἐκβοηθέν· οὐ ταῦτα\r\nἐπαινοῦντα(376) οὐδὲ εὐδαίμονας καὶ μακαρίους ὁμολογοῦντα τοὺς πολλὴν\r\nκεκτημένους χώραν, πλεῖστα δ᾽ ἔθνη καὶ ἐν αὐτοῖς πολλοὺς μὲν Ἑλλήνων,\r\nπλείους δὲ ἔτι καὶ μείζους βαρβάρων καὶ τὸν Ἄθω διορύττειν δυναμένους καὶ\r\nσχεδίᾳ τὰς ἠπείρους, ἐπειδὰν ἐθέλωσι διαβαίνειν, συνάπτοντας καὶ ἔθνη\r\nκαταστρεφομένους [B] καὶ αἱροῦντας νήσους καὶ σαγηνεύοντας καὶ λιβανωτοῦ\r\nχίλια τάλαντα καταθύοτας. οὔτε οὖν Ξέρξην ἐκεῖνος ἐπῄνει ποτὲ οὔτε ἄλλον\r\nτινὰ Περσῶν ἢ Λυδῶν ἢ Μακεδόνων βασιλέα, ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ Ἑλλήνων στρατηγόν, πλὴν\r\nσφόδρα ὀλίγων, ὁπόσους ἠπίστατο χαίροντας ἀρετῇ καὶ ἀσπαζομένους ἀνδρείαν\r\nμετὰ σωφροσύνης καὶ φρόνησιν μετὰ δικαιοσύνης στέργοντας. ὅσους δὲ\r\nἀγχίνους ἢ δεινοὺς ἢ στρατηγικοὺς ἢ κομψοὺς καὶ τῷ πλήθει πιθανοὺς ἑώρα,\r\nσμίκρ᾽ ἄττα μόρια κατανειμαμένους ἀρετῆς, [C] οὐδὲ τούτους ἐς ἅπαν ἐπῄνει.\r\nἕπεται δὲ αὐτοῦ τῇ κρίσει σοφῶν ἀνδρῶν δῆμος ἀρετὴν θεραπεύοντες, τὰ\r\nκλεινὰ δὲ οἶμαι ταῦτα καὶ θαυμαστὰ οἱ μὲν ὀλίγου τινός, οἱ δὲ οὐδενὸς ἄξια\r\nλέγοντες.\r\n\r\n(For I have observed that Socrates the Athenian—you know the man by\r\nhearsay and that his reputation for wisdom was proclaimed aloud by the\r\nPythian oracle(377)—I say I have observed that he did not praise that sort\r\nof thing, nor would he admit(378) that they are happy and fortunate who\r\nare masters of a great territory and many nations, with many Greeks too\r\namong them, and still more numerous and powerful barbarians, such men as\r\nare able to cut a canal through Athos and join continents(379) by a bridge\r\nof boats whenever they please, and who subdue nations and reduce islands\r\nby sweeping the inhabitants into a net,(380) and make offerings of a\r\nthousand talents’ worth of frankincense.(381) Therefore he never praised\r\nXerxes or any other king of Persia or Lydia or Macedonia, and not even a\r\nGreek general, save only a very few, whomsoever he knew to delight in\r\nvirtue and to cherish courage with temperance and to love wisdom with\r\njustice. But those whom he saw to be cunning, or merely clever, or\r\ngenerals and nothing more, or ingenious, or able, though each one could\r\nlay claim to only one small fraction of virtue, to impose on the masses,\r\nthese too he would not praise without reserve. And his judgment is\r\nfollowed by a host of wise men who reverence virtue, but as for all those\r\nwonders and marvels that I have described, some say of them that they are\r\nworth little, others that they are worth nothing.)\r\n\r\nΕἰ μὲν οὖν καὶ ὑμῖν ταύτῃ πῃ ξυνδοκεῖ, δέος οὐ φαῦλόν με ἔχει περὶ τῶν\r\nἔμπροσθεν λόγων καὶ ἐμαυτοῦ, μή ποτε ἄρα τοὺς μὲν παιδιὰν(382) ἀποφήνητε,\r\nσοφιστὴν δὲ ἐμὲ γελοῖον καὶ ἀμαθῆ, μεταποιούμενον τέχνης, [D] ἧς σφόδρα\r\nἀπείρως ἔχειν ὁμολογῶ, ὥς γ᾽ ἐμοὶ πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὁμολογητέον ἐστὶ τοὺς ἀληθεῖς\r\nἐπαίνους διεξιόντι καὶ ὧν ἀκούειν ἄξιον ὑμῖν οἴεσθε, εἰ καὶ ἀγροικότεροι\r\nκαὶ ἐλάττους μακρῷ τῶν ῥηθέντων τοῖς πολλοῖς φαίνοιντο. εἰ δέ, ὅπερ\r\nἔμπροσθεν ἔφην, ἀποδέχεσθε τοὺς ἐκείνων ποιητάς, ἐμοὶ μὲν ἀνεῖται τὸ δέος\r\nεὖ μάλα. οὐ γὰρ πάντα ὑμῖν ἄτοπος φανοῦμαι, ἀλλὰ πολλῶν μὲν οἶμαι\r\nφαυλότερος, κατ᾽ ἐμαυτὸν δὲ ἐξεταζόμενος οὐ παντάπασιν [80] ἀπόβλητος οὐδὲ\r\nἀτόποις ἐπιχειρῶν. ὑμῖν δὲ ἴσως οὐ ῥᾴδιον σοφοῖς καὶ θείοις ἀπιστεῖν\r\nἀνδράσιν, οἳ δὴ λέγουσι πολλὰ μὲν ἕκαστος ἰδίᾳ, τὸ κεφάλαιον δέ ἐστι τῶν\r\nλόγων ἀρετῆς ἔπαινος. ταύτην δὲ τῇ ψυχῇ φασιν ἐμφύεσθαι καὶ αὐτὴν\r\nἀποφαίνειν εὐδαίμονα καὶ βασιλικὴν καὶ ναὶ μὰ Δία πολιτικὴν καὶ\r\nστρατηγικὴν καὶ μεγαλόφρονα καὶ πλουσίαν γε ἀληθῶς οὐ τὸ Κολοφώνιον\r\nἔχουσαν χρυσίον.\r\n\r\n(Now if you also are of their opinion, I feel no inconsiderable alarm for\r\nwhat I said earlier, and for myself, lest possibly you should declare that\r\nmy words are mere childishness, and that I am an absurd and ignorant\r\nsophist and make pretensions to an art in which I confess that I have no\r\nskill, as indeed I must confess to you when I recite eulogies that are\r\nreally deserved, and such as you think it worth while to listen to, even\r\nthough they should seem to most of you somewhat uncouth and far inferior\r\nto what has been already uttered. But if, as I said before, you accept the\r\nauthors of those other eulogies, then my fear is altogether allayed. For\r\nthen I shall not seem wholly out of place, but though, as I admit,\r\ninferior to many others, yet judged by my own standard, not wholly\r\nunprofitable nor attempting what is out of place. And indeed it is\r\nprobably not easy for you to disbelieve wise and inspired men who have\r\nmuch to say, each in his own manner, though the sum and substance of all\r\ntheir speeches is the praise of virtue. And virtue they say is implanted\r\nin the soul and makes it happy and kingly, yes, by Zeus, and statesmanlike\r\nand gifted with true generalship, and generous and truly wealthy, not\r\nbecause it possesses the Colophonian(383) treasures of gold,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    [B] Οὐδ᾽ ὅσα λάϊνος οὐδὸς ἀφήτορος ἐντὸς ἐέργε\r\n\r\n    (“Nor all that the stone threshold of the Far‐Darter contained\r\n

γνώριμοι ὅτιπερ\r\nἈθηναῖοι τὸν Σάραμβον.\r\n\r\n(For there is nothing at all superior to it, nothing that can constrain\r\nand control it, or take it from him who has once possessed it. Indeed it\r\nseems to me that this possession bears the same relation to the soul as\r\nits light to the sun. For often men have stolen the votive offerings of\r\nthe Sun and destroyed his temples and gone their way, and some have been\r\npunished, and others let alone as not worthy of the punishment that leads\r\nto amendment. But his light no one ever takes from the sun, not even the\r\nmoon when in their conjunctions she oversteps his disc, or when she takes\r\nhis rays to herself, and often, as the saying is, turns midday into\r\nnight.(398) Nor is he deprived of his light when he illumines the moon in\r\nher station opposite to himself and shares with her his own nature, nor\r\nwhen he fills with light and day this great and wonderful universe. Just\r\nso no good man who imparts his goodness to another was ever thought to\r\nhave less virtue by as much as he had bestowed. So divine and excellent is\r\nthat possession, and most true is the saying of the Athenian stranger,\r\nwhoever that inspired man may have been: “All the gold beneath the earth\r\nand above ground is too little to give in exchange for virtue.”(399) Let\r\nus therefore now boldly call its possessor wealthy, yes and I should say\r\nwell‐born also, and the only king among them all,(400) if anyone agree to\r\nthis. For as noble birth is better than a lowly pedigree, so virtue is\r\nbetter than a character not in all respects admirable. And let no one say\r\nthat this statement is contentious and too strong, judging by the ordinary\r\nuse of words. For the multitude are wont to say that the sons of those who\r\nhave long been rich are well‐born. And yet is it not extraordinary that a\r\ncook or cobbler, yes, by Zeus, or some potter who has got money together\r\nby his craft, or by some other means, is not considered well‐born nor is\r\ngiven that title by the many, whereas if this man’s son inherit his estate\r\nand hand it on to his sons, they begin to give themselves airs and compete\r\non the score of noble birth with the Pelopids and the Heraclids? Nay, even\r\na man who is born of noble ancestors, but himself sinks down in the\r\nopposite scale of life, could not justly claim kinship with those\r\nancestors, seeing that no one could be enrolled among the Pelopids who had\r\nnot on his shoulder the birth‐mark(401) of that family. And in Boeotia it\r\nwas said that there was the impression of a spear on the Sown‐men(402)\r\nfrom the clod of earth that bore and reared them, and that hence the race\r\nlong preserved that distinguishing mark. And can we suppose that on men’s\r\nsouls no mark of that sort is engraved, which shall tell us accurately who\r\ntheir fathers were and vindicate their birth as legitimate? They say that\r\nthe Celts also have a river(403) which is an incorruptible judge of\r\noffspring, and neither can the mothers persuade that river by their\r\nlaments to hide and conceal their fault for them, nor the fathers who are\r\nafraid for their wives and sons in this trial, but it is an arbiter that\r\nnever swerves or gives a false verdict. But we are corrupted by riches, by\r\nphysical strength in its prime, by powerful ancestors, an influence from\r\nwithout that overshadows and does not permit us to see clearly or discern\r\nthe soul; for we are unlike all other living things in this, that by the\r\nsoul and by nothing else, we should with reason make our decision about\r\nnoble birth. And it seems to me that the ancients, employing a wondrous\r\nsagacity of nature, since their wisdom was not like ours a thing acquired,\r\nbut they were philosophers by nature, not manufactured,(404) perceived the\r\ntruth of this, and so they called Heracles the son of Zeus, and Leda’s two\r\nsons also, and Minos the law‐giver, and Rhadamanthus of Cnossus they\r\ndeemed worthy of the same distinction. And many others they proclaimed to\r\nbe the children of other gods, because they so surpassed their mortal\r\nparents. For they looked at the soul alone and their actual deeds, and not\r\nat wealth piled high and hoary with age, nor at the power that had come\r\ndown to them from some grandfather or great‐grandfather. And yet some of\r\nthem were the sons of fathers not wholly inglorious. But because of the\r\nsuperabundance in them of that virtue which men honoured and cherished,\r\nthey were held to be the sons of the gods themselves. This is clear from\r\nthe following fact. In the case of certain others, though they did not\r\nknow those who were by nature their sires, they ascribed that title to a\r\ndivinity, to recompense the virtue of those men. And we ought not to say\r\nthat they were deceived, and that in ignorance they told lies about the\r\ngods. For even if in the case of other gods or deities it was natural that\r\nthey should be so deceived, when they clothed them in human forms and\r\nhuman shapes, though those deities possess a nature not to be perceived or\r\nattained by the senses, but barely recognisable by means of pure\r\nintelligence, by reason of their kinship with it; nevertheless in the case\r\nof the visible gods it is not probable that they were deceived, for\r\ninstance, when they entitled Aeetes “son of Helios” and another(405) “son\r\nof the Dawn,” and so on with others. But, as I said, we must in these\r\ncases believe them, and make our enquiry about noble birth accordingly.\r\nAnd when a man has virtuous parents and himself resembles them, we may\r\nwith confidence call him nobly born. But when, though his parents lack\r\nvirtue, he himself can claim to possess it, we must suppose that the\r\nfather who begat him is Zeus, and we must not pay less respect to him than\r\nto those who are the sons of virtuous fathers and emulate their parents.\r\nBut when a bad man comes of good parents, we ought to enrol him among the\r\nbastards, while as for those who come of a bad stock and resemble their\r\nparents, never must we call them well‐born, not even though their wealth\r\namounts to ten thousand talents, not though they reckon among their\r\nancestors twenty rulers, or, by Zeus, twenty tyrants, not though they can\r\nprove that the victories they won at Olympia or Pytho or in the encounters\r\nof war—which are in every way more brilliant than victories in the\r\ngames—were more than the first Caesar’s, or can point to excavations in\r\nAssyria(406) or to the walls of Babylon and the Egyptian pyramids besides,\r\nand to all else that is a proof of wealth and great possessions and luxury\r\nand a soul that is inflamed by ambition and, being at a loss how to use\r\nmoney, lavishes on things of that sort all those abundant supplies of\r\nwealth. For you are well aware that it is not wealth, either ancestral or\r\nnewly acquired and pouring in from some source or other, that makes a\r\nking, nor his purple cloak nor his tiara and sceptre and diadem and\r\nancestral throne, nay nor numerous hoplites and ten thousand cavalry; not\r\nthough all men should gather together and acknowledge him for their king,\r\nbecause virtue they cannot bestow on him, but only power, ill‐omened\r\nindeed for him that receives it, but still more for those that bestow it.\r\nFor once he has received such power, a man of that sort is altogether\r\nraised aloft in the clouds, and in nowise differs from the legend of\r\nPhaethon and his fate. And there is no need of other instances to make us\r\nbelieve this saying, for the whole of life is full of such disasters and\r\ntales about them. And if it seems surprising to you that the title of\r\nking, so honourable, so favoured by the gods, cannot justly be claimed by\r\nmen who, though they rule over a vast territory and nations without\r\nnumber, nevertheless settle questions that arise by an autocratic\r\ndecision, without intelligence or wisdom or the virtues that go with\r\nwisdom, believe me they are not even free men; I do not mean if they\r\nmerely possess what they have with none to hinder them and have their fill\r\nof power, but even though they conquer all who make war against them, and,\r\nwhen they lead an invading army, appear invincible and irresistible. And\r\nif any of you doubt this statement, I have no lack of notable witnesses,\r\nGreek and barbarian, who fought and won many mighty battles, and became\r\nthe masters of whole nations and compelled them to pay tribute, and yet\r\nwere themselves slaves in a still more shameful degree of pleasure, money\r\nand wantonness, insolence and injustice. And no man of sense would call\r\nthem even powerful, not though greatness should shine upon and illumine\r\nall that they achieved. For he alone is strong whose virtue aids him to be\r\nbrave and magnanimous. But he who is the slave of pleasure and cannot\r\ncontrol his temper and appetites of all sorts, but is compelled to succumb\r\nto trivial things, is neither brave himself nor strong with a man’s\r\nstrength, though we may perhaps allow him to exult like a bull or lion or\r\nleopard(407) in his brute force, if indeed he do not lose even this and,\r\nlike a drone, merely superintend the labours of others, himself a “feeble\r\nwarrior,”(408) and cowardly and dissolute. And if that be his character,\r\nhe is lacking not only in true riches, but in that wealth also which men\r\nso highly honour and reverence and desire, on which hang the souls of men\r\nof all sorts, so that they undergo countless toils and labours for the\r\nsake of daily gain, and endure to sail the sea and to trade and rob and\r\ngrasp at tyrannies. For they live ever acquiring but ever in want, though\r\nI do not say of necessary food and drink and clothes; for the limit of\r\nthis sort of property has been clearly defined by nature and none can be\r\ndeprived of it, neither birds nor fish nor wild beasts, much less prudent\r\nmen. But those who are tortured by the desire and fatal passion for money\r\nmust suffer a lifelong hunger,(409) and depart from life more miserably\r\nthan those who lack daily food. For these, once they have filled their\r\nbellies, enjoy perfect peace and respite from their torment, but for those\r\nothers no day is sweet that does not bring them gain, nor does night with\r\nher gift of sleep that relaxes the limbs and frees men from care(410)\r\nbring for them any remission of their raging madness, but distracts and\r\nagitates their souls as they reckon and count up their money. And not even\r\nthe wealth of Tantalus and Midas, should they possess it, frees those men\r\nfrom their desire and their hard toil therewith, nay nor “Tyranny the\r\ngreatest and sternest of the gods,”(411) should they become possessed of\r\nthis also. For have you not heard that Darius, the ruler of Persia, a man\r\nnot wholly base, but insatiably and shamefully covetous of money, dug up\r\nin his greed even the tombs of the dead(412) and exacted the most costly\r\ntribute? And hence he acquired the title(413) that is famous among all\r\nmankind. For the notables of Persia called him by the name that the\r\nAthenians gave to Sarambos.(414))\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἔοικε γὰρ ὁ λόγος, ὥσπερ ὁδοῦ τινος κατάντους ἐπιλαβόμενος, ἀφειδῶς\r\nἐμφορεῖσθαι τῆς καταρρήσεως καὶ πέρα τοῦ δέοντος κολάζειν τῶν ἀνδρῶν τοὺς\r\nτρόπους, ὥστε οὐκ ἐπιτρεπτέον αὐτῷ περαιτέρω φοιτᾶν.

But now I must demand from it an account, as far as is\r\npossible, of the man who is good and kingly and great‐souled. In the first\r\nplace, then, he is devout and does not neglect the worship of the gods,\r\nand secondly he is pious and ministers to his parents, both when they are\r\nalive and after their death, and he is friendly to his brothers, and\r\nreverences the gods who protect the family, while to suppliants and\r\nstrangers he is mild and gentle; and he is anxious to gratify good\r\ncitizens, and governs the masses with justice and for their benefit. And\r\nwealth he loves, but not that which is heavy with gold and silver, but\r\nthat which is full of the true good‐will of his friends,(420) and service\r\nwithout flattery. Though by nature he is brave and gallant, he takes no\r\npleasure in war, and detests civil discord, though when men do attack him,\r\nwhether from some chance, or by reason of their own wickedness, he resists\r\nthem bravely and defends himself with energy, and carries through his\r\nenterprises to the end, not desisting till he has destroyed the power of\r\nthe foe and made it subject to himself. But after he has conquered by\r\nforce of arms, he makes his sword cease from slaughter, because he thinks\r\nthat for one who is no longer defending himself to go on killing and\r\nlaying waste is to incur pollution. And being by nature fond of work, and\r\ngreat of soul, he shares in the labours of all; and claims the lion’s\r\nshare of those labours, then divides with the others the rewards for the\r\nrisks which he has run, and is glad and rejoices, not because he has more\r\ngold and silver treasure than other men, and palaces adorned with costly\r\nfurniture, but because he is able to do good to many, and to bestow on all\r\nmen whatever they may chance to lack. This is what he who is truly a king\r\nclaims for himself. And since he loves both the city and the\r\nsoldiers,(421) he cares for the citizens as a shepherd for his flock,\r\nplanning how their young may flourish and thrive, eating their full of\r\nabundant and undisturbed pasture; and his soldiers he oversees and keeps\r\ntogether, training them in courage, strength and mercy, like well‐bred\r\ndogs, noble guardians of the flock,(422) regarding them both as the\r\npartners of his exploits and the protectors of the masses, and not as\r\nspoilers and pillagers of the flock, like wolves and mongrel dogs which,\r\nforgetting their own nature and nurture, turn out to be marauders instead\r\nof preservers and defenders. Yet on the other hand, he will not suffer\r\nthem to be sluggish, slothful and unwarlike, lest the guardians should\r\nthemselves need others to watch them, nor disobedient to their officers,\r\nbecause he knows that obedience above all else, and sometimes alone, is\r\nthe saving discipline in war. And he will train them to be hardy and not\r\nafraid of any labour, and never indolent, for he knows that there is not\r\nmuch use in a guardian who shirks his task and cannot hold out or endure\r\nfatigue. And not only by exhorting, or by his readiness to praise the\r\ndeserving or by rewarding and punishing severely and inexorably, does he\r\nwin them over to this and coerce them; but far rather does he show that he\r\nis himself what he would have them be, since he refrains from all\r\npleasure, and as for money desires it not at all, much or little, nor robs\r\nhis subjects of it; and since he abhors indolence he allows little time\r\nfor sleep, For in truth no one who is asleep is good for anything,(423)\r\nnor if, when awake he resembles those who are asleep. And he will, I\r\nthink, succeed in keeping them wonderfully obedient to himself and to\r\ntheir officers, since he himself will be seen to obey the wisest laws and\r\nto live in accordance with right precepts, and in short to be under the\r\nguidance of that part of the soul which is naturally kingly and worthy to\r\ntake the lead, and not of the emotional or undisciplined part. For how\r\ncould one better persuade men to endure and undergo fatigue, not only in a\r\ncampaign and under arms, but also in all those exercises that have been\r\ninvented in times of peace to give men practice for conflicts abroad, than\r\nby being clearly seen to be oneself strong as adamant? For in truth the\r\nmost agreeable sight for a soldier, when he is fighting hard, is a prudent\r\ncommander who takes an active part in the work in hand, himself zealous\r\nwhile exhorting his men, who is cheerful and calm in what seems to be a\r\ndangerous situation, but on occasion stern and severe whenever they are\r\nover confident. For in the matter of caution or boldness the subordinate\r\nnaturally imitates his leader. And he must plan as well, no less than for\r\nwhat I have mentioned, that they may have abundant provisions and run\r\nshort of none of the necessaries of life. For often the most loyal\r\nguardians and protectors of the flock are driven by want to become fierce\r\ntowards the shepherds, and when they see them from afar they bark at them\r\nand do not even spare the sheep.(424))\r\n\r\nΤοιοῦτος μὲν ἐπὶ στρατοπέδων ὁ γενναῖος, πόλει δὲ σωτὴρ καὶ κηδεμών, οὔτι\r\nτοὺς ἔξωθεν μόνον ἀπείργων κινδύνους οὐδὲ ἀντιταττόμενος ἢ καὶ\r\nἐπιστρατεύων βαρβάροις γείτοσι· στάσιν δὲ ἐξαιρῶν καὶ ἔθη [C] μοχθηρὰ καὶ\r\nτρυφὴν καὶ ἀκολασίαν τῶν μεγίστων κακῶν παρέξει ῥᾳστώνην. ὕβριν δὲ\r\nἐξείργων καὶ παρανομίαν καὶ ἀδικίαν καὶ ἐπιθυμίαν ἀμέτρου κτήσεως τὰς(425)\r\nἐκ τούτων ἀναφυομένας στάσεις καὶ ἔριδας εἰς οὐδὲν χρηστὸν τελευτώσας οὐδὲ\r\nτὴν ἀρχὴν ἀνέξεται φῶναι, γενομένας δὲ ὡς ἔνι τάχιστα ἀφανιεῖ(426) καὶ\r\nἐξελάσει τῆς αὑτοῦ πόλεως. λήσεται δὲ αὐτὸν οὐδεὶς ὑπερβὰς τὸν νόμον καὶ\r\nβιασάμενος, οὐ(427) μᾶλλον ἢ τῶν πολεμίων τις τὸν χάρακα.

And by excluding insolence,\r\nlawlessness, injustice and greed for boundless wealth, he will not permit\r\nthe feuds that arise from these causes and the dissensions that end in\r\ndisaster to show even the first sign of growth, and if they do arise he\r\nwill abolish them as quickly as possible and expel them from his city. And\r\nno one who transgresses and violates the law will escape his notice, no\r\nmore than would an enemy in the act of scaling his defences. But though he\r\nis a good guardian of the laws, he will be still better at framing them,\r\nif ever occasion and chance call on him to do so. And no device can\r\npersuade one of his character to add to the statutes a false and spurious\r\nand bastard law, any more than he would introduce among his own sons a\r\nservile and vulgar strain. For he cares for justice and the right, and\r\nneither parents nor kinsfolk nor friends can persuade him to do them a\r\nfavour and betray the cause of justice. For he looks upon his fatherland\r\nas the common hearth and mother of all, older and more reverend than his\r\nparents, and more precious than brothers or friends or comrades; and to\r\ndefraud or do violence to her laws he regards as a greater impiety than\r\nsacrilegious robbery of the money that belongs to the gods. For law is the\r\nchild of justice, the sacred and truly divine adjunct of the most mighty\r\ngod, and never will the man who is wise make light of it or set it at\r\nnaught. But since all that he does will have justice in view, he will be\r\neager to honour the good, and the vicious he will, like a good physician,\r\nmake every effort to cure.)\r\n\r\nΔιττῶν δὲ ὄντων τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων, καὶ τῶν μὲν ὑποφαινόντων ἐλπίδας ἀμείνους\r\nκαὶ οὐ πάντη τὴν θεραπείαν ἀπεστραμμένων, τῶν δὲ ἀνίατα πλημμελούντων·\r\nτούτοις δὲ οἱ νόμοι θάνατον λύσιν τῶν κακῶν ἐπενόησαν, οὐκ εἰς τὴν ἐκείνων\r\nμᾶλλον, εἰς δὲ τὴν ἄλλων ὠφέλειαν· [C] διττὰς δ᾽ ἀνάγκη τὰς κρίσεις\r\nγίγνεσθαι. οὐκοῦν τῶν μὲν ἰασίμων αὑτῷ προσήκειν ὑπολήψεται τήν τε\r\nἐπίγνωσιν καὶ τὴν θεραπείαν, ἀφέξεται δὲ τῶν ἄλλων μάλα ἐρρωμένως, καὶ οὐκ\r\nἄν ποτε ἑκὼν ἅψαιτο κρίσεως, ἐφ᾽ ᾗ θάνατος ἡ ζημία παρὰ τῶν νόμων τοῖς\r\nὠφληκόσι τὴν δίκην προηγόρευται.(431) νομοθετῶν δὲ ὑπὲρ τῶν τοιούτων ὕβριν\r\nμὲν καὶ χαλεπότητα καὶ πικρίαν τῶν τιμωριῶν ἀφαιρήσει, ἀποκληρώσει δὲ\r\nαὐτοῖς ἀνδρῶν σωφρόνων καὶ [D] διὰ παντὸς τοῦ βίου βάσανον οὐ φαύλην τῆς\r\nαὑτῶν ἀρετῆς παρασχομένων δικαστήριον,(432) οἳ μηδὲν αὐθαδῶς μηδὲ ὁρμῇ\r\nτινι παντελῶς ἀλόγῳ χρώμενοι, ἐν ἡμέρας μορίῳ σμικρῷ βουλευσάμενοι, τυχὸν\r\nδὲ οὐδὲ βουλῇ δόντες, ὑπὲρ ἀνδρὸς πολίτου τὴν μέλαιναν οἴσουσι ψῆφον. αὐτῷ\r\nδὲ οὔτε ἐν τῇ χειρὶ ξίφος εἰς πολίτου, κἂν ἀδικῇ τὰ ἔσχατα, φόνον οὔτε ἐν\r\nτῇ ψυχῇ κέντρον ὑπεῖναι χρή, ὅπου καὶ τὴν τῶν μελιττῶν ὁρῶμεν βασιλεύουσαν\r\nκαθαρὰν [90] ὑπὸ τῆς φύσεως πλήκτρου γενομένην. ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ εἰς μελίττας\r\nβλεπτέον, εἰς αὐτὸν δὲ οἶμαι τῶν θεῶν τὸν βασιλέα οὗπερ εἶναι χρὴ τὸν\r\nἀληθῶς ἄρχοντα προφήτην καὶ ὑπηρέτην. οὐκοῦν ὅσα μὲν ἀγαθὰ γέγονε παντελῶς\r\nτῆς ἐναντίας ἄμικτα φύσεως καὶ ἐπ᾽ ὠφελείᾳ κοινῇ τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ τοῦ\r\nπαντὸς κόσμου, τούτων δὲ αὐτὸς ἦν τε καὶ ἔστι δημιουργός· τὰ κακὰ δὲ οὔτ᾽\r\nἐγέννησεν οὔτ᾽ ἐπέταξεν εἶναι, ἀλλ᾽ αὐτὰ μὲν ἐφυγάδευσεν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, [B]\r\nπερὶ δὲ τὴν γῆν στρεφόμενα καὶ τὴν ἐκεῖθεν ἀποικίαν σταλεῖσαν τῶν ψυχῶν\r\nδιαλαβόμενα κρίνειν ἐπέταξε καὶ διακαθαίρειν τοῖς αὑτοῦ παισὶ καὶ\r\nἐγγόνοις. τούτων δὲ οἱ μέν εἰσι σωτῆρες καὶ ἐπίκουροι τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης\r\nφύσεως, ἄλλοι δὲ ἀπαραίτητοι κριταί, τῶν ἀδικημάτων ὀξεῖαν καὶ δεινὴν\r\nἐπάγοντες δίκην ζῶσί τε ἀνθρώποις καὶ ἀπολυθεῖσι τῶν σωμάτων, οἱ δὲ ὥσπερ\r\nδήμιοι [C] τιμωροί τινες καὶ ἀποπληρωταὶ τῶν δικασθέντων, ἕτερον τῶν\r\nφαύλων καὶ ἀνοήτων δαιμόνων τὸ φῦλον· ἃ δὴ μιμητέον τῷ γενναίῳ καὶ\r\nθεοφιλεῖ, καὶ μεταδοτέον πολλοῖς μὲν τῆς ἑαυτοῦ ἀρετῆς(433) διὰ φιλίας ἐς\r\nταύτην τὴν κοινωνίαν προσληφθεῖσιν.(434) ἀρχὰς δὲ ἐπιτρεπτέον οἰκείας\r\nἑκάστου τῇ φύσει καὶ προαιρέσει, τῷ μὲν ἀνδρώδει καὶ τολμηρῷ καὶ\r\nμεγαλοθύμῳ μετὰ ξυνέσεως στρατιωτικάς, ἵν᾽ εἰς δέον ἔχῃ τῷ θυμῷ χρῆσθαι\r\nκαὶ τῇ ῥώμῃ, τῷ δικαίῳ δὲ καὶ πρᾴῳ καὶ [D] φιλανθρώπῳ καὶ πρὸς οἶκτον\r\nεὐχερῶς ἐπικλωμένῳ τῶν πολιτικῶν τὰς ἀμφὶ τὰ συναλλάγματα, βοηθείας τοῖς\r\nἀσθενεστέροις καὶ ἁπλουστέροις μηχανώμενον καὶ πένησι πρὸς τοὺς ἰσχυροὺς\r\nκαὶ ἀπατεῶνας καὶ πανούργους καὶ ἐπαιρομένους τοῖς χρήμασιν ἐς τὸ\r\nβιάζεσθαι καὶ ὑπερορᾶν τῆς δίκης, τῷ δὲ ἐξ ἀμφοῖν κεκραμένῳ μείζονα\r\nἐν(435) τῇ πόλει τιμὴν καὶ δύναμιν περιθετέον, καὶ αὐτῷ τὰς ὑπὲρ τῶν\r\nἁμαρτημάτων κρίσεις, [91] οἷς ἕπεται τιμωρία καὶ κόλασις ἔνδικος ἐπ᾽\r\nὠφελείᾳ τῶν ἀδικουμένων ἐπιτρέπων(436) ὀρθῶς ἂν καὶ ἐμφρόνως λογίζοιτο.\r\nκρίνας γὰρ ὁ τοιοῦτος ἀδεκάστως ἅμα τοῖς συνέδροις παραδώσει τῷ δημίῳ τὰ\r\nγνωσθέντα ἐπιτελεῖν, οὔτε διὰ θυμοῦ μέγεθος οὔτε διὰ μαλακίαν ψυχῆς\r\nἁμαρτάνων τοῦ φύσει διακαίου. κινδυνεύει δὲ ὁ κράτιστος ἐν πόλει τοιοῦτός\r\nτις εἶναι, [B] τὰ μὲν ἐν ἀμφοτέροις ἔχων ἀγαθά, τὰς δὲ οἷον κῆρας ἐκ τοῦ\r\nπλεονάζοντος ἐν ἑκάστῳ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν εἰρημένων ἐκφεύγων. ἐφορῶν δὲ αὐτὸς\r\nἅπαντα καὶ κατευθύνων καὶ ἄρχων ἀρχόντων τοὺς μὲν ἐπὶ τῶν μεγίστων ἔργων\r\nκαὶ διοικήσεων τεταγμένους καὶ αὐτῷ τῆς ὑπὲρ ἁπάντων βουλῆς κοινωνοῦντας\r\nἀγαθούς τε εἶναι καὶ ὅ,τι μάλιστα αὑτοῦ παραπλησίους εὔξεται γενέσθαι.\r\nαἱρήσεται δὲ οὐχ ἁπλῶς οὐδὲ ὡς ἔτυχεν, οὐδ᾽ ἐθελήσει φαυλότερος εἶναι\r\nκριτὴς τῶν λιθογνωμόνων [C] καὶ τῶν βασανιζόντων τὸ χρυσίον ἢ τὴν\r\nπορφύραν. τούτοις γὰρ οὐ μία ὁδὸς ἐπὶ τὴν ἐξέτασιν ἀπόχρη, ἀλλὰ συνιέντες\r\nοἶμαι τῶν πανουργεῖν ἐθελόντων ποικίλην καὶ πολύτροπον τὴν μοχθηρίαν καὶ\r\nτὰ ἐπιτεχνήματα εἰς δύναμιν ἅπασιν ἀντετάξαντο, καὶ ἀντέστησαν ἐλέγχους\r\nτοὺς ἐκ τῆς τέχνης. ὃ δὴ καὶ αὐτὸς περὶ τῆς κακίας ὑπολαμβάνων, ὡς ἐστὶ\r\nποικίλη καὶ ἀπατηλὴ καὶ τοῦτό ἐστι χαλεπώτατον τῶν ἐκείνης ἔργων, [D] ὅτι\r\nδὴ ψεύδεται πολλάκις ἀρετὴν ὑποδυομένη καὶ ἐξαπατᾷ τοὺς οὐ δυναμένους\r\nὀξύτερον ὁρᾶν ἢ καὶ ἀποκάμνοντας τῷ μήκει τοῦ χρόνου πρὸς τὴν ἐξέτασιν, τὸ\r\nπαθεῖν τι τοιοῦτον ὀρθῶς φυλάξεται. ἑλόμενος δὲ ἅπαξ καὶ περὶ αὑτὸν τοὺς\r\nἀρίστους ἔχων τούτοις ἐπιτρέψει τὴν τῶν ἐλασσόνων ἀρχόντων αἵρεσιν.\r\n\r\n(But there are two kinds of error, for in one type of sinner may dimly be\r\ndiscerned a hope of improvement, nor do they wholly reject a cure, while\r\nthe vices of others are incurable. And for the latter the laws have\r\ncontrived the penalty of death as a release from evil, and this not only\r\nfor the benefit of the criminal, but quite as much in the interest of\r\nothers. Accordingly there must needs be two kinds of trials. For when men\r\nare not incurable the king will hold it to be his duty to investigate and\r\nto cure. But with the others he will firmly refuse to interfere, and will\r\nnever willingly have anything to do with a trial when death is the penalty\r\nthat has been ordained by the laws for the guilty. However, in making laws\r\nfor such offences, he will do away with violence and harshness and cruelty\r\nof punishment, and will elect by lot, to judge them, a court of staid and\r\nsober men who throughout their lives have admitted the most rigid scrutiny\r\nof their own virtue, men who will not rashly, or led by some wholly\r\nirrational impulse, after deliberating for only a small part of the day,\r\nor it may be without even debating, cast the black voting‐tablet in the\r\ncase of a fellow‐citizen. But in his own hand no sword should lie ready to\r\nslay a citizen, even though he has committed the blackest crimes, nor\r\nshould a sting lurk in his soul, considering that, as we see, nature has\r\nmade even the queen‐bee free from a sting. However it is not to bees that\r\nwe must look for our analogy, but in my opinion to the king of the gods\r\nhimself, whose prophet and vice‐regent the genuine ruler ought to be. For\r\nwherever good exists wholly untainted by its opposite, and for the benefit\r\nof mankind in common and the whole universe, of this good God was and is\r\nthe only creator. But evil he neither created nor ordered to be,(437) but\r\nhe banished it from heaven, and as it moves upon earth and has chosen for\r\nits abode our souls, that colony which was sent down from heaven, he has\r\nenjoined on his sons and descendants to judge and cleanse men from it. Now\r\nof these some are the friends and protectors of the human race, but others\r\nare inexorable judges who inflict on men harsh and terrible punishment for\r\ntheir misdeeds, both while they are alive and after they are set free from\r\ntheir bodies, and others again are as it were executioners and avengers\r\nwho carry out the sentence, a different race of inferior and unintelligent\r\ndemons. Now the king who is good and a favourite of the gods must imitate\r\nthis example, and share his own excellence with many of his subjects,\r\nwhom, because of his regard for them, he admits into this partnership; and\r\nhe must entrust them with offices suited to the character and principles\r\nof each; military command for him who is brave and daring and high‐\r\nspirited, but discreet as well, so that when he has need he may use his\r\nspirit and energy; and for him who is just and kind and humane and easily\r\nprone to pity, that office in the service of the state that relates to\r\ncontracts, devising this means of protection for the weaker and more\r\nsimple citizens and for the poor against the powerful, fraudulent and\r\nwicked and those who are so buoyed up by their riches that they try to\r\nviolate and despise justice; but to the man who combines both these\r\ntemperaments he must assign still greater honour and power in the state,\r\nand if he entrust to him the trials of offences for which are enacted just\r\npains and penalties with a view to recompensing the injured, that would be\r\na fair and wise measure. For a man of this sort, together with his\r\ncolleagues, will give an impartial decision, and then hand over to the\r\npublic official the carrying out of the verdict, nor will he through\r\nexcess of anger or tender‐heartedness fall short of what is essentially\r\njust. Now the ruler in our state will be somewhat like this, possessing\r\nonly what is good in both those qualities, and in every quality that I\r\nmentioned earlier avoiding a fatal excess.(438) And though he will in\r\nperson oversee and direct and govern the whole, he will see to it that\r\nthose of his officials who are in charge of the most important works and\r\nmanagement and who share his councils for the general good, are virtuous\r\nmen and as far as possible like himself. And he will choose them, not\r\ncarelessly or at random, nor will he consent to be a less rigorous judge\r\nthan a lapidary or one who tests gold plate or purple dye. For such men\r\nare not satisfied with one method of testing, but since they know, I\r\nsuppose, that the wickedness and devices of those who are trying to cheat\r\nthem are various and manifold, they try to meet all these as far as\r\npossible, and they oppose to them the tests derived from their art. So too\r\nour ruler apprehends that evil changes its face and is apt to deceive, and\r\nthat the cruellest thing that it does is that it often takes men in by\r\nputting on the garb of virtue, and hoodwinks those who are not keen\r\nsighted enough, or who in course of time grow weary of the length of the\r\ninvestigation, and therefore he will rightly be on his guard against any\r\nsuch deception. But when once he has chosen them, and has about him the\r\nworthiest men, he will entrust to them the choice of the minor officials.)\r\n\r\nΝόμων μὲν δὴ πέρι καὶ ἀρχόντων τοιάδε γινώσκει. τοῦ πλήθους δὲ τὸ μὲν ἐν\r\nτοῖς ἄστεσιν οὔτε ἀργὸν οὔτε αὔθαδες ἀνέξεται εἶναι οὔτε μὴν ἐνδεὲς τῶν\r\nἀναγκαίων· [92] τὸ δὲ ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς τῶν γεωργῶν φῦλον ἀροῦντες καὶ\r\nφυτεύοντες τροφὴν ἀποίσουσι τοῖς φύλαξι καὶ ἐπικούροις σφῶν, μισθὸν καὶ\r\nἐσθῆτα τὴν ἀναγκαίαν. οἰκοδομήματα δὲ Ἀσσύρια καὶ πολυτελεῖς καὶ δαπανηρὰς\r\nλειτουργίας χαίρειν ἐάσαντες ἐν εἰρήνῃ πολλῇ τῶν τε ἔξωθεν πολεμίων καὶ\r\nτῶν οἴκοθεν καταβιώσονται, ἀγαπῶντες μὲν τὸν αἴτιον τῶν παρόντων σφίσι\r\nκαθάπερ ἀγαθὸν δαίμονα, [B] ὑμνοῦντες δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ τὸν θεὸν καὶ\r\nἐπευχόμενοι, οὔτι πλαστῶς οὐδὲ ἀπὸ γλώττης, ἔνδοθεν δὲ ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς τῆς ψυχῆς\r\nαἰτοῦσιν αὐτῷ τὰ ἀγαθά. φθάνουσι δὲ οἱ θεοὶ τὰς εὐχάς, καὶ αὐτῷ πρότερον\r\nτὰ θεῖα δόντες οὐτὲ τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων ἐστέρησαν. εἰ δὲ τὸ χρεὼν βιάζοιτο κακῷ\r\nτῷ περιπεσεῖν, τούτων δὴ τῶν θρυλουμένων ἀνηκέστων, χορευτήν τε αὑτῶν\r\nἐποιήσαντο καὶ συνέστιον, [C] καὶ αὐτῷ κλέος καθ᾽ ἅπαντας ἤγειραν\r\nἀνθρώπους. ταῦτα ἐγὼ τῶν σοφῶν ἀκούω πολλάκις, καί με ὁ λόγος ἰσχυρῶς\r\nπείθει. οὐκοῦν καὶ ἐς ὑμᾶς αὐτὸν διεξῆλθον, μακρότερα μὲν τυχὸν ἴσως τοῦ\r\nκαιροῦ φθεγγόμενος, ἐλάττονα δὲ οἶμαι τῆς ὑποθέσεως· καὶ ὅτῳ γέγονε τῶν\r\nτοιούτων λόγων ἐπακούειν ἐν φροντίδι, οὗτος ὅτι μὴ ψεύδομαι σαφῶς\r\nἐπίσταται. ἑτέρα δέ ἐστιν αἰτία τοῦ μήκους τῆς μὲν εἰρημένης ἧττον\r\nἀναγκαία, [D] προσεχεστέρα δὲ οἶμαι τῷ παρόντι λόγῳ· τυχὸν δὲ οὐδὲ ταύτης\r\nἀγηκόους ὑμᾶς εἶναι χρή.\r\n\r\n(Such is his policy with regard to the laws and magistrates. As for the\r\ncommon people, those who live in the towns he will not allow to be idle or\r\nimpudent, but neither will he permit them to be without the necessaries of\r\nlife. And the farming class who live in the country, ploughing and sowing\r\nto furnish food for their protectors and guardians, will receive in return\r\npayment in money, and the clothes that they need. But as for Assyrian\r\npalaces and costly and extravagant public services, they will have nothing\r\nto do with them, and will end their lives in the utmost peace as regards\r\nenemies at home and abroad, and will adore the cause of their good fortune\r\nas though he were a kindly deity, and praise God for him when they pray,\r\nnot hypocritically or with the lips only, but invoking blessings on him\r\nfrom the bottom of their hearts. But the gods do not wait for their\r\nprayers, and unasked they give him celestial rewards, but they do not let\r\nhim lack human blessings either; and if fate should compel him to fall\r\ninto any misfortune, I mean one of those incurable calamities that people\r\nare always talking about, then the gods make him their follower and\r\nassociate, and exalt his fame among all mankind. All this I have often\r\nheard from the wise, and in their account of it I have the firmest faith.\r\nAnd so I have repeated it to you, perhaps making a longer speech than the\r\noccasion called for, but too short in my opinion for the theme. And he to\r\nwhom it has been given to hear such arguments and reflect on them, knows\r\nwell that I speak the truth. But there is another reason for the length of\r\nmy speech, less forcible, but I think more akin to the present argument.\r\nAnd perhaps you ought not to miss hearing this also.)\r\n\r\nΠρῶτον μὲν οὖν ὑπομνησθῶμεν μικρὰ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν, ὁπότε τῆς ὑπὲρ τούτων\r\nδιηγήσεως ἀπεπαυόμεθα. ἔφαμέν που χρῆναι τοὺς σπουδαίους τῶν ἀληθινῶν\r\nἐπαίνων ἀκροατὰς οὐκ εἰς ταῦτα ὁρᾶν, ὧν ἡ τύχη καὶ τοῖς μοχθηροῖς πολλάκις\r\nμεταδίδωσιν, εἰς δὲ τὰς ἕξεις καὶ τὴν ἀρετήν, ἧς μόνοις μέτεστι τοῖς\r\nἀγαθοῖς ἀνδράσι καὶ φύσει σπουδαίοις.

And when one of\r\nthem harmonises exactly and without variation with this model, he is\r\nhimself happy and truly fortunate, and happy are those who have a share in\r\nsuch a government as his. And he who comes near to being like him is\r\nbetter and more fortunate than those who fall further short of him. But\r\nthose who fail altogether to resemble him, or who follow an opposite\r\ncourse, are ill‐fated, senseless and wicked, and cause the greatest\r\ndisasters to themselves and others.)\r\n\r\nΕἰ δὴ οὖν καὶ ὑμῖν ταῦτῃ πῃ ξυνδοκεῖ, ὥρα ἐπεξιέναι τοῖς ἔργοις, ἂ\r\nτεθαυμάκαμεν. καὶ ὅπως μή τις ὑπολάβῃ τὸν λόγον καθ᾽ αὑτὸν ἰόντα, καθάπερ\r\nἵππον ἀνταγωνιστοῦ στερόμενον ἐν τοῖς δρόμοις, κρατεῖν καὶ ἀποφέρειν τὰ\r\nνικητήρια, πειράσομαι, πῇ ποτε διαφέρετον ἀλλήλων ὅ τε ἡμέτερος [C] καὶ ὁ\r\nτῶν σοφῶν ῥητόρων ἔπαινος, δεῖξαι. οὐκοῦν οἱ μὲν τὸ προγόνων γενέσθαι\r\nδυναστῶν καὶ βασιλέων θαυμάζουσι μάλα, ὀλβίων καὶ εὐδαιμόνων μακαρίους\r\nὑπολαμβάνοντες τοὺς ἐκγόνους· τὸ δὲ ἐπὶ τούτοις οὔτε ἐνενόησαν οὔτε\r\nἐσκέψαντο, τίνα τρόπον διατελοῦσιν τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς(441) χρώμενοι. καίτοι γε\r\nτοῦτο ἦν τῆς εὐτυχίας ἐκείνης τὸ κεφάλαιον καὶ σχεδὸν ἁπάντων τῶν ἐκτὸς\r\nἀγαθῶν· εἰ μή τις καὶ πρὸς τοὔνομα δυσχεραίνει, [D] τὴν κτῆσιν ὑπὸ τῆς\r\nἔμφρονος χρήσεως ἀγαθὴν καὶ φαύλην ὑπὸ τῆς ἐναντίας γίγνεσθαι συμβαίνειν·\r\nὥστε οὐ μέγα, καθάπερ οἴονται, τὸ βασιλέως πλουσίου καὶ πολυχρύσου\r\nγενέσθαι, μέγα δὲ ἀληθῶς τὸ τὴν ἀρετὴν τὴν πατρῴαν ὑπερβαλλόμενον ἄμεμπτον\r\nαὑτὸν τοῖς γειναμένοις παρασχεῖν εἰς ἅπαν.\r\n\r\n(And now if you are in any way of my opinion, it is time to proceed to\r\nthose achievements that we have so admired. And lest any should think that\r\nmy argument is running alone, like a horse in a race that has lost its\r\ncompetitor and for that reason wins and carries off the prizes, I will try\r\nto show in what way my encomium differs from that of clever rhetoricians.\r\nFor they greatly admire the fact that a man is born of ancestors who had\r\npower or were kings, since they hold that the sons of the prosperous and\r\nfortunate are themselves blest. But the question that next arises they\r\nneither think of nor investigate, I mean how they employed their\r\nadvantages throughout their lives. And yet, after all, this is the chief\r\ncause of that happiness, and of almost all external goods. Unless indeed\r\nsomeone objects to this statement that it is only by wise use of it that\r\nproperty becomes a good, and that it is harmful when the opposite use is\r\nmade. So that it is not a great thing, as they think, to be descended from\r\na king who was wealthy and “rich in gold,” but it is truly great, while\r\nsurpassing the virtue of one’s ancestors, to behave to one’s parents in a\r\nmanner beyond reproach in all respects.)\r\n\r\nΒούλεσθε οὖν εἰ τοῦτο ὑπάρχει βασελεῖ καταμαθεῖν; παρέξομαι δὲ ὑμῖν ἐγὼ\r\nμαρτυρίαν πιστὴν, [94] καί με οὐχ αἱρήσετε ψευδομαρτυρίων,(442) εὖ οἶδα·\r\nὑπομνήσω γὰρ ὑμᾶς(443) ὧν ἴστε· τυχὸν δὲ καὶ ἤδη τοῦ λεγομένου ξυνίετε, εἴ\r\nτε οὔπω δῆλον, αὐτίκα μάλα ξυνήσετε ἐννοήσαντες πρῶτον μὲν ὡς αὐτὸν ὁ\r\nπατὴρ ἠγάπα διαφερόντως, οὔτι πρᾷος ὢν λίαν τοῖς ἐκγόνοις οὐδὲ τῇ φύσει\r\nπλέον ἢ τῷ τρόπῳ διδούς, ἡττώμενος δὲ οἶμαι τῆς θεραπείας καὶ οὐκ ἔχων,\r\n[B] ὄτι μέμφοιτο, δῆλος ἦν εὔνους ὤν. καὶ αὐτοῦ σημεῖον τῆς γνώμης, πρῶτον\r\nμὲν ὅτι Κωνσταντίῳ ταύτην ἐξεῖλε τὴν μοῖραν, ἣν αὑτῷ πρότερον προσήκειν\r\nἔχειν ὑπέλαβεν, εἶθ᾽ ὅτι τελευτῶν τὸν βίον, τὸν πρεσβύτατον καὶ τὸν\r\nνεώτατον ἀφεὶς σχολὴν ἄγοντας, τοῦτον δὴ ἄσχολον ἐκάλει καὶ ἐπέτρεπε τὰ\r\nπερὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν ξύμπαντα. γενόμενος δὲ ἐγκρατὴς ἁπάντων οὕτω τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς\r\nδικαίως ἅμα καὶ σωφρόνως προσηνέχθη, ὥστε οἱ μὲν οὔτε κληθέντες οὔτε\r\nἀφικόμενοι πρὸς [C] ἀλλήλους ἐστασίαζον καὶ διεμάχοντο, τούτῳ δὲ\r\nἐχαλέπαινον οὐδὲν οὐδὲ ἐμέμφοντο. ἐπεὶ δὲ αὐτῶν ἡ στάσις τέλος εἶχεν οὐκ\r\nεὐτυχές, ἐξὸν μεταποιεῖσθαι πλειόνων, ἑκὼν ἀφῆκε, τῆς αὐτῆς ἀρετῆς\r\nὑπολαμβάνων πολλά τε ἔθνη καὶ ὀλίγα δεῖσθαι, περικεῖσθαι δέ, οἶμαι,\r\nφροντίδας μείζονας ὅτῳ πλειόνων ἀνάνκη τημελεῖν καὶ(444) κήδεσθαι. οὐ γὰρ\r\nδὴ τρυφῆς ὑπολαμβάνει τὴν βασιλείαν εἶναι παρασκευὴν οὐδέ, ὥσπερ ἐπὶ τῶν\r\nχρημάτων εἰς πότους [D] καὶ ἡδονὰς οἱ καταχρώμενοι μειζόνων εὐπορίαν\r\nπροσόδων ἐπινοοῦσιν, οὕτω χρῆναι τὸν βασιλέα παρασκευάζεσθαι, οὐδὲ\r\nἀναιρεῖσθαι πόλεμον, ὅ,τι μὴ τῶν ἀρχομένων τῆς ὠφελείας ἕνεκα. οὐκοῦν\r\nἐκείνῳ μὲν ἔχειν τὸ πλέον ξυγχωρῶν, αὐτὸς δὲ μετὰ ἀρετῆς ἔλαττον ἔχων τῷ\r\nκρατίστῳ πλεονεκτεῖν ὑπέλαβε. καὶ ὅτι μὴ δέει [95] μᾶλλον τῆς ἐκείνου\r\nπαρασκευῆς τὴν ἡσυχίαν ἠγάπα, τεκμήριον ὑμῖν ἐμφανὲς ἔστω ὁ μετὰ ταῦτα\r\nξυμπεσὼν πόλεμος. ἐχρήσατο γοῦν πρὸς τὰς ἐκείνου δυνάμεις ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ τοῖς\r\nὅπλοις ὕστερον. πάλιν δὲ ἐνταῦθα ἐκεῖνοι μέν που τὸ νικᾶν τεθαυμάκασιν·\r\nἐγὼ δὲ πολὺ πλέον τὸ ξὺν δίκῃ μὲν ἀνελέσθαι τὸν πόλεμον, διενεγκεῖν δὲ\r\nἀνδρείως καὶ μάλα ἐμπείρως, ἐπιθείσης δὲ τὸ τέλος τῆς τύχης δεξιὸν\r\nχρήσασθαι τῇ νίκῃ σωφρόνως καὶ βασιλικῶς, καὶ ὅλως ἄξιον τοῦ κρατεῖν\r\nφανῆναι.\r\n\r\n(Do you wish to learn whether this is true of the Emperor? I will offer\r\nyou trustworthy evidence, and I know well that you will not convict me of\r\nfalse witness. For I shall but remind you of what you know already. And\r\nperhaps you understand even now what I mean, but if it is not yet evident\r\nyou very soon will, when you call to mind that the Emperor’s father loved\r\nhim more than the others, though he was by no means over‐indulgent to his\r\nchildren, for it was character that he favoured rather than the ties of\r\nblood; but he was, I suppose, won over by the Emperor’s dutiful service to\r\nhim, and as he had nothing to reproach him with, he made his affection for\r\nhim evident. And a proof of his feeling is, first, that he chose for\r\nConstantius that portion of the empire which he had formerly thought best\r\nsuited to himself, and, secondly, that when he was at the point of death\r\nhe passed over his eldest(445) and youngest(446) sons, though they were at\r\nleisure, and summoned Constantius, who was not at leisure, and entrusted\r\nhim with the whole government. And when he had become master of the whole,\r\nhe behaved to his brothers at once so justly and with such moderation,\r\nthat, while they who had neither been summoned nor had come of themselves\r\nquarrelled and fought with one another, they showed no resentment against\r\nConstantius, nor ever reproached him. And when their feud reached its\r\nfatal issue(447), though he might have laid claim to a greater share of\r\nempire, he renounced it of his own free will, because he thought that many\r\nnations or few called for the exercise of the same virtues, and also,\r\nperhaps, that the more a man has to look after and care for the greater\r\nare the anxieties beset him. For he does not think that the imperial power\r\nis a means of procuring luxury, nor that, as certain men who have wealth\r\nand misapply it for drink and other pleasures set their hearts on lavish\r\nand ever‐increasing revenues, this ought to be an emperor’s policy, nor\r\nthat he ought ever to embark on a war except only for the benefit of his\r\nsubjects. And so he allowed his brother(448) to have the lion’s share, and\r\nthought that if he himself possessed the smaller share with honour, he had\r\nthe advantage in what was most worth having. And that it was not rather\r\nfrom fear of his brother’s resources that he preferred peace, you may\r\nconsider clearly proved by the war that broke out later. For he had\r\nrecourse to arms later on against his brother’s forces, but it was to\r\navenge him(449). And here again there are perhaps some who have admired\r\nhim merely for having won the victory. But I admire far more the fact that\r\nit was with justice that he undertook the war, and that he carried it\r\nthrough with great courage and skill, and, when fortune gave him a\r\nfavourable issue, used his victory with moderation and in imperial\r\nfashion, and showed himself entirely worthy to overcome.)\r\n\r\n[B] Βούλεσθε οὖν καὶ τούτων ὑμῖν ὥσπερ ἐν τοῖς δικαστηρίοις ὀνομαστὶ\r\nκαλῶμεν τοὺς μάρτυρας; καὶ ὅτι μὲν οὐδείς πω πόλεμος συνέστη πρότερον οὐδὲ\r\nἐπὶ τὴν Τροίαν τοῖς Ἕλλησιν οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τοὺς Πέρσας Μακεδόσιν, οἵπερ δὴ\r\nδοκοῦσιν ἐν δίκῃ γενέσθαι, τοσαύτην ἔχων ὑπόθεσιν, καὶ παιδί που δῆλον,\r\nτοῖς μέν γε λίαν ἀρχαίων ἀδικημάτων τιμωρίας σφόδρα νεαρᾶς(450) οὔτ᾽ εἰς\r\nπαῖδας οὔτε εἰς ἐγγόνους γενομένης, ἀλλὰ εἰς τὸν ἀφελόμενον καὶ\r\nἀποστερήσαντα [C] τὴν ἀρχὴν τοὺς τῶν ἀδικησάντων ἀπογόνους· Ἀγαμέμνων δὲ\r\nὥρμητο\r\n\r\n(Now do you wish that, as though I were in a law‐court, I should summon\r\nbefore you by name witnesses of this also?

But the wrongs done to Constantius were still fresh, and\r\nhe(454) who was in power was not, like Darius or Priam, a man of royal\r\nbirth who, it may be, laid claim to an empire that belonged to him by\r\nreason of his birth or his family, but a shameless and savage barbarian\r\nwho not long before had been among the captives of war.(455) But all that\r\nhe did and how he governed is neither agreeable for me to tell nor would\r\nit be well‐timed. And that the Emperor was justified in making war on him\r\nyou have heard, and of his skill and courage what I said earlier is proof\r\nenough, but deeds are, I think, more convincing than words. But what\r\nhappened after the victory, and how he no longer made use of the sword,\r\nnot even against those who were under suspicion of serious crimes, or who\r\nhad been familiar friends of the usurper, nay not even against anyone who,\r\nto curry favour with the latter, had stooped to win a tale‐bearer’s fee by\r\nslandering the Emperor, consider, in the name of Zeus the god of\r\nfriendship, that not even these paid the penalty of their audacity, except\r\nwhen they were guilty of other crimes. And yet what a terrible thing is\r\nslander! How truly does it devour the heart and wound the soul as iron\r\ncannot wound the body! This it was that goaded Odysseus to defend himself\r\nby word and deed. At any rate it was for this reason that he quarrelled\r\nwith his host(456) when he was himself a wanderer and a guest, and though\r\nhe knew that)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἄφρων ... καὶ οὐτιδανὸς πέλει ἀνήρ,\r\n    Ὅστις ξεινοδόκῳ ἔριδα προφέρῃσι βαρεῖαν,\r\n\r\n    (“Foolish and of nothing worth is that man who provokes a violent\r\n    quarrel with his host.”(457))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ Ἀλέξανδρον τὸν Φιλίππου καὶ Ἀχιλλέα τὸν Θέτιδος(458) καὶ ἄλλους δὲ\r\nτινας οὐ φαύλος οὐδὲ ἀγεννεῖς ἀνθρώπους.

But only to Socrates, I\r\nthink, and a few others who emulated him, men who were truly fortunate and\r\nhappy, was it given to put off the last garment that man discards—the love\r\nof glory.(460) For resentment of calumny is due to the passion for glory,\r\nand for this reason it is implanted most deeply in the noblest souls. For\r\nthey resent it as their deadliest foe, and those who hurl at them\r\nslanderous language they hate more than men who attack them with the sword\r\nor plot their destruction; and they regard them as differing from\r\nthemselves, not merely in their acquired habits, but in their essential\r\nnature, seeing that they love praise and honour, and the slanderer not\r\nonly robs them of these, but also manufactures false accusations against\r\nthem. They say that even Heracles and certain other heroes were swayed by\r\nthese emotions. But for my part I do not believe this account of them, and\r\nas for the Emperor I have seen him repelling calumny with great self‐\r\nrestraint, which in my judgment is no slighter achievement than “to take\r\nTroy”(461) or rout a powerful phalanx. And if anyone does not believe me,\r\nand thinks it no great achievement nor worth all these praises, let him\r\nobserve himself when a misfortune of this sort happens to him, and then\r\nlet him decide; and I am convinced that he will not think that I am\r\ntalking with exceeding folly.)\r\n\r\nΤοιοῦτος δὲ ὢν καὶ γενόμενος βασιλεὺς μετὰ τὸν πόλεμον εἰκότως οὐ μόνον\r\nἐστὶ ποθεινὸς τοῖς φίλοις καὶ ἀγαπητός, [B] πολλοῖς(462) μὲν τιμῆς καὶ\r\nδυνάμεως καὶ παρρησίας μεταδιδούς, χρήματα δὲ αὐτοῖς ἄφθονα χαριζόμενος\r\nκαὶ χρῆσθαι ὅπως τις βούλεται τῷ πλούτῳ ξυγχωρῶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς πολεμίοις\r\nτοιοῦτος ἐδόκει. τεκμήριον δὲ ὑμῖν ἐμφανὲς καὶ τοῦδε γιγνέσθω· ἄνδρες, τῆς\r\nγερουσίας ὅτιπερ ὄφελος, ἀξιώσει καὶ πλούτῳ καὶ ξυνέσει διαφέροντες τῶν\r\nἄλλων, ὥσπερ ἐς λιμένα καταφεύγοντες τὴν τούτου δεξιάν, ἑστίας τε λιπόντες\r\n[C] καὶ οἴκους καὶ παῖδας Παιονίαν μὲν ἀντὶ τῆς Ῥώμης, τὴν μετὰ τούτου δὲ\r\nἀντὶ τῶν φιλτάτων συνουσίαν ἠσπάσαντο, ἴλη τε τῶν ἐπιλέκτων ἱππέων ξὺν\r\nτοῖς σημείοις καὶ τὸν στρατηγὸν ἄγουσα τούτῳ τοῦ κινδύνου ξυμμετέχειν\r\nμᾶλλον ἢ ἐκείνῳ τῆς εὐτυχίας ἠξίου. καὶ ταῦτα ἅπαντα ἐδρᾶτο πρὸ τῆς μάχης\r\nἣν ἐπὶ τοῦ Δράου ταὶς ᾐόσιν ὁ πρόσθεν λόγος παρέστησεν· ἐντεῦθεν γὰρ ἤδη\r\nβεβαίως ἐθάρρουν, τέως δ ἐδόκει τὰ τῶν τυράννων ἐπικρατεῖν, [D]\r\nπλεονεκτήματός τινος περὶ τοὺς κατασκόπους τοὺς(463) βασιλέως γενομένου, ὁ\r\nδὴ ἐκεῖνόν τε ἐποίησεν ὑπὸ τῆς ἡδονῆς ἄφρονα καὶ ἐξετάραττε τοὺς οὐ\r\nδυναμένους ἐφικνεῖσθαι οὐδὲ διορᾶν τὴν στρατηγίαν. ὁ δὲ ἦν ἀκατάπληκτος\r\nκαὶ γεννάδας καθάπερ ἀγαθὸς νεὼς κυβερνήτης, ἐξαπίνης νεφῶν ῥαγείσης\r\nλαίλαπος, εἶτα ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ τοῦ θεοῦ σείοντος τὸν βυθὸν καὶ τὰς ᾐόνας. ἐνταῦθα\r\nγὰρ τοὺς μὲν ἀπείρους δεινὸν καὶ ἄτοπον κατέλαβε δέος, [98] ὁ δὲ ἤδη\r\nχαίρει καὶ γάνυται, γαλήνην ἀκριβῆ καὶ νηνεμίαν ἐλπίζων. λέγεται γὰρ δὴ\r\nκαὶ ὁ Ποσειδῶν συνταράττων τὴν γῆν παύειν τὰ κύματα. καὶ ἡ τύχη δὲ τοὺς\r\nἀνοήτους ἐξαπατᾷ καὶ σφάλλει περὶ τοῖς μείζοσι, μικρὰ πλεονεκτεῖν\r\nἐπιτρέπουσα, τοῖς ἔμφροσι δὲ τὸ βεβαίως θαρσεῖν ὑπὲρ τῶν μειζόνων, ὅταν ἐν\r\nτοῖς ἐλάττοσιν αὐτοὺς διαταράττῃ, παρέχει. τοῦτο Λακεδαιμόνιοι παθόντες ἐν\r\nΠύλαις οὐκ ἀπηγόρευον οὐδὲ ἔδεισαν [B] τὸν Μῆδον ἐπιφερόμενον, τριακοσίους\r\nΣπαρτιατῶν καὶ τὸν βασιλέα περὶ τὰς εἰσβολὰς τῆς Ἑλλάδος προέμενοι· τοῦτο\r\nῬωμαῖοι πολλάκις παθόντες μείζονα κατώρθουν ὕστερον· ὁ δὴ καὶ βασιλεὺς\r\nἐννοῶν καὶ λογιζόμενος οὐδαμῶς ἐσφάλη τῆς γνώμης.\r\n\r\n(Now since this was and is the Emperor’s behaviour after the war, he is\r\nnaturally loved and “longed for by his friends,”(464) since he has\r\nadmitted many of them to honour and power and freedom of speech, and has\r\nbestowed on them as well vast sums of money, and permits them to use their\r\nwealth as they please; but even to his enemies he is the same. The\r\nfollowing may serve as a clear proof of this. Those members of the Senate\r\nwho were of any account and surpassed the rest in reputation and wealth\r\nand wisdom, fled to the shelter of his right hand as though to a harbour,\r\nand, leaving behind their hearths and homes and children, preferred\r\nPaeonia(465) to Rome, and to be with him rather than with their dearest.\r\nAgain, a division of the choicest of the cavalry together with their\r\nstandards, and bringing their general(466) with them, chose to share\r\ndanger with him rather than success with the usurper. And all this took\r\nplace before the battle on the banks of the Drave, which the earlier part\r\nof my speech described to you. For after that they began to feel perfect\r\nconfidence, though before that it looked as though the usurper’s cause was\r\ngetting the upper hand, when he gained some slight advantage in the affair\r\nof the Emperor’s scouts,(467) which indeed made the usurper beside himself\r\nwith joy and greatly agitated those who were incapable of grasping or\r\nestimating generalship. But the Emperor was unperturbed and heroic, like a\r\ngood pilot when a tempest has suddenly burst from the clouds, and next\r\nmoment, the god shakes the depths and the shores. Then a terrible and\r\ndreadful panic seizes on those who are inexperienced, but the pilot begins\r\nto rejoice, and is glad, because he can now hope for a perfect and\r\nwindless calm. For it is said that Poseidon, when he makes the earth\r\nquake, calms the waves. And just so fortune deceives the foolish and\r\ndeludes them about more important things by allowing them some small\r\nadvantage, but in the wise she inspires unshaken confidence about more\r\nserious affairs even when she disconcerts them in the case of those that\r\nare less serious. This was what happened to the Lacedaemonians at\r\nPylae,(468) but they did not despair nor fear the onset of the Mede\r\nbecause they had lost three hundred Spartans and their king(469) at the\r\nentrance into Greece. This often happened to the Romans, but they achieved\r\nmore important successes later on.

A certain man(475) who had been given the command of the\r\ngarrisons in Galatia—you probably know his name and character—left his son\r\nbehind him as a hostage for his friendship and loyalty to the Emperor,\r\nthough not at the Emperor’s request. Then he proved to be more treacherous\r\nthan “lions who have no faithful covenants with man,”(476) as the poet\r\nsays, and plundered the cities of their wealth and distributed it among\r\nthe invading barbarians, paying it down as a sort of ransom, though he was\r\nwell able to take measures to win security by the sword rather than by\r\nmoney. But he tried to win them over to friendliness by means of money.\r\nAnd finally he took from the women’s apartments a purple dress, and showed\r\nhimself truly a tyrant and tragical indeed. Then the soldiers, resenting\r\nhis treachery, would not tolerate the sight of him thus dressed up in\r\nwomen’s garb,(477) and they set on the miserable wretch and tore him limb\r\nfrom limb,(478) nor would they endure either that the crescent moon(479)\r\nshould rule over them. Now it was the affection of his garrison that gave\r\nthe Emperor this guerdon, a wonderful recompense for his just and\r\nblameless rule. But you are eager to hear how he behaved after this. This\r\ntoo, however, you cannot fail to know, that he chose neither to be harsh\r\ntowards that man’s son(480) nor suspicious and formidable to his friends,\r\nbut in the highest possible degree he was merciful and kindly to them all,\r\nthough many desired to bring false accusations(481) and had raised their\r\nstings to strike the innocent. But though many were perhaps really\r\ninvolved in the crimes of which they were suspected, he was merciful to\r\nall alike, provided they had not been convicted or proved to be partners\r\nin the usurper’s monstrous and abominable schemes. And shall we not\r\ndeclare that the forbearance shown by him towards the son of one who had\r\nbroken the laws and trampled on loyalty and sworn covenants was truly\r\nroyal and godlike; or shall we rather approve Agamemnon, who vented his\r\nrage and cruelty not only on those Trojans who had accompanied Paris and\r\nhad outraged the hearth of Menelaus, but even on those who were yet\r\nunborn, and whose mothers even were perhaps not yet born when Paris\r\nplotted the rape? Anyone therefore who thinks that cruelty and harshness\r\nand inhumanity ill become a king, and that mercy and goodness and human\r\nkindness befit one who takes no pleasure in acts of vengeance, but grieves\r\nat the misfortunes of his subjects, however they may arise, whether from\r\ntheir own wickedness and ignorance or aimed at them from without by fate,\r\nwill, it is evident, award to the Emperor the palm of victory. For bear in\r\nmind that he was kinder and more just to the boy than his own father, and\r\nto the usurper’s friends he was more loyal than he who acknowledged the\r\ntie of friendship. For the usurper forsook them all, but the Emperor saved\r\nthem all. And if the usurper, knowing all this about the Emperor’s\r\ncharacter, since he had for a long time been able to observe it, was\r\nentirely confident that his son was safely at anchor and his friends\r\nsecurely also, then he did indeed understand him aright, but he was many\r\ntimes over criminal and base and accursed for desiring to be at enmity\r\nwith such a man, and for hating one whom he knew to be so excellent and so\r\nsurpassingly mild, and for plotting against him and trying to rob him of\r\nwhat it was a shame to take from him. But if, on the other hand, his son’s\r\nsafety was something that he had never hoped for, and the safety of his\r\nfriends and kinsfolk he had thought difficult or impossible, and he\r\nnevertheless chose to be disloyal, this is yet another proof that he was\r\nwicked and infatuated and fiercer than a wild beast, and that the Emperor\r\nwas gentle and mild and magnanimous, since he took pity on the youth of\r\nthe helpless child, and was merciful to those who were not proved guilty,\r\nand ignored and despised the crimes of the usurper. For he who grants what\r\nnot one of his enemies expects, because the guilt that is on their\r\nconscience is so great, beyond a doubt carries off the prize for virtue:\r\nfor while he tempers justice with what is nobler and more merciful, in\r\nself‐restraint he surpasses those who are merely moderate in their\r\nvengeance; and in courage he excels because he thinks no enemy worthy of\r\nnotice; and his wisdom he displays by suppressing enmities and by not\r\nhanding them down to his sons and descendants on the pretext of strict\r\njustice, or of wishing, and very reasonably too, to blot out the seed of\r\nthe wicked like the seed of a pine‐tree.(482) For this is the way of those\r\ntrees, and in consequence an ancient tale(483) gave rise to this simile.\r\nBut the good Emperor, closely imitating God, knows that even from rocks\r\nswarms of bees fly forth, and that sweet fruits grow even from the\r\nbitterest wood, pleasant figs, for instance, and from thorns the\r\npomegranate, and there are other instances where things are produced\r\nentirely unlike the parents that begat them and brought them forth.\r\nTherefore he thinks that we ought not to destroy these before they have\r\nreached maturity, but to wait for time to pass, and to trust them to cast\r\noff the folly and madness of their fathers and become good and temperate,\r\nbut that, if they should turn out to emulate their fathers’ practices,\r\nthey will in good time suffer punishment, but they will not have been\r\nuselessly sacrificed because of the deeds and misfortunes of others.\r\n\r\nἎρ᾽ οὖν ὑμῖν ἱκανῶς δοκοῦμεν ἐκτετελεκέναι τὸν ἀληθινὸν ἔπαινον; ἢ ποθεῖτε\r\nἀκούειν ὑμεῖς καὶ τὴν καρτερίαν καὶ τὴν σεμνότητα, καὶ ὡς οὐ μόνον ἐστὶ\r\nτῶν πολεμίων ἀήττητος, [C] ἀλλ᾽ οὔτε αἰσχρᾶς ἐπιθυμίας ἑάλω πώποτε, οὔτε\r\nοἰκίας καλῆς οὔτ᾽ ἐπαύλεως πολυτελοῦς οὔτε ὅρμων σμαραγδίνων ἐπιθυμήσας\r\nἀφείλετο βίᾳ ἢ καὶ πειθοῖ τοὺς κεκτημένους, ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ γυναικὸς ἐλευθέρας\r\nοὐδὲ θεραπαίνης, οὐδὲ ὅλως τὴν ἄδικον ἀφροδίτην ἠγάπησε, καὶ ὡς οὐδὲ ὧν\r\nὧραι φύουσιν ἀγαθῶν τὴν ἄμετρον ἀπαιτεῖ πλησμονήν, οὐδὲ αὐτῷ θέρους ὥρᾳ\r\nτοῦ κρυστάλλου μέλει, [D] οὐδὲ μεταβάλλει πρὸς τὰς ὥρας τὴν οἴκησιν, τοῖς\r\nπονουμένοις δὲ ἀεὶ πάρεστι τῆς ἀρχῆς μέρεσιν ἀντέχων καὶ πρὸς τὸ κρύος καὶ\r\nπρὸς τὰ θάλπη τὰ γενναῖα; τούτων δὲ εἴ με κελεύοιτε φέρειν ὑμῖν ἐμφανῆ τὰ\r\nτεκμήρια, γνώριμα μὲν ἐρῶ καὶ οὐκ ἀπορήσω, μακρὸς δὲ ὁ λόγος καὶ\r\nδιωλύγιος, ἐμοί τε οὐ σχολὴ τὰς μούσας ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον θεραπεύειν, ἀλλ᾽ ὥρα\r\nλοιπὸν πρὸς ἔργον τρέπεσθαι.\r\n\r\n(Now do you think I have made my sincere panegyric sufficiently thorough\r\nand complete? Or are you anxious to hear also about the Emperor’s powers\r\nof endurance and his august bearing, and that not only is he unconquerable\r\nby the enemy, but has never yet succumbed to any disgraceful appetite, and\r\nnever coveted a fine house or a costly palace or a necklace of emeralds,\r\nand then robbed their owners of them either by violence or persuasion; and\r\nthat he has never coveted any free‐born woman or handmaid or pursued any\r\ndishonourable passion; and that he does not even desire an immoderate\r\nsurfeit of the good things that the seasons produce, or care for ice in\r\nsummer, or change his residence with the time of year; but is ever at hand\r\nto aid those portions of the empire that are in trouble, enduring both\r\nfrost and extreme heat? But if you should bid me bring before you plain\r\nproofs of this, I shall merely say what is familiar to all, and I shall\r\nnot lack evidence, but the account would be long, a monstrous speech, nor\r\nindeed have I leisure to cultivate the Muses to such an extent, for it is\r\nnow time for me to turn to my work.(484))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORATION III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction To Oration III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Oration is an expression of gratitude (χαριστήριος λόγος)(485)\r\nto the Empress Eusebia, the first wife of Constantius. After Julian’s\r\nintractable step‐brother Gallus Caesar had been murdered by the Emperor,\r\nhe was summoned to the court at Milan, and there, awkward and ill at ease,\r\ncut off from his favourite studies and from the society of philosophers,\r\nsurrounded by intriguing and unfriendly courtiers, and regarded with\r\nsuspicion by the Emperor, Julian was protected, encouraged and advised by\r\nEusebia. His praise and gratitude are, for once, sincere. The oration must\r\nhave been composed either in Gaul or shortly before Julian set out thither\r\nafter the dangerous dignity of the Caesarship had been thrust upon him.\r\nHis sincerity has affected his style, which is simpler and more direct\r\nthan that of the other two Panegyrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΚΑΙΣΑΡΟΣ ΕΥΣΕΒΙΑΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Caesar)\r\n\r\nΤΗΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΙΔΟΣ ΕΓΚΩΜΙΟΝ\r\n\r\n(Panegyric in Honour of the Empress Eusebia)\r\n\r\n[102] Τί ποτε ἄρα χρὴ διανοεῖσθαι περὶ τῶν ὀφειλόντων μεγάλα καὶ πέρα(486)\r\nμεγάλων, οὔτι φημὶ χρυσίον οὐδὲ ἀργύριον, ἀλλὰ ἁπλῶς ὅ,τι ἂν τύχῃ τις παρὰ\r\nτοῦ πέλας εὖ παθών· εἶτα τοιαῦτα μὲν ἀποτίνειν οὔτε ἐπιχειρούντων οὔτε\r\nδιανοουμένων, ῥᾳθύμως δὲ καὶ ὀλιγώρως ἐχόντων πρὸς τὸ τὰ δυνατὰ ποιεῖν καὶ\r\nδιαλύεσθαι τὸ ὄφλημα; [B] ἢ δῆλον ὅτι φαύλους καὶ μοχθηροὺς νομιστέον;\r\nοὐδενὸς γὰρ οἶμαι τῶν ἄλλων ἀδικημάτων ἔλαττον μισοῦμεν ἀχαριστίαν καὶ\r\nὀνειδίζομεν τοῦς ἀνθρώποις, ὅταν εὖ παθόντες περὶ τοὺς εὐεργέτας ὦσιν\r\nἀχάριστοι· ἔστι δὲ οὐχ οὗτος ἀχάριστος μόνον, ὅστις εὖ παθὼν δρᾷ κακῶς ἢ\r\nλέγει, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅστις σιωπᾷ καὶ ἀποκρύπτει, λήθῃ παραδιδοὺς καὶ ἀφανίζων\r\nτὰς χάριτας. καὶ τῆς μὲν θηριώδους ἐκείνης [C] καὶ ἀπανθρώπου μοχθηρίας\r\nσφόδρα ὀλίγα καὶ εὐαρίθμητα κομιδῇ τὰ παραδείγματα· πολλοὶ δὲ ἀποκρύπτουσι\r\nτὸ δοκεῖν εὖ παθεῖν, οὐκ οἶδα ὅ,τι βουλόμενοι· φασὶ δὲ ὅμως θωπείας τινὸς\r\nκαὶ ἀγεννοῦς κολακείας τὴν δόξαν ἐκκλίνειν. ἐγὼ δὲ [103] τούτους(487) μὲν\r\nὅτι μηδὲν ὑγιὲς λέγουσι σαφῶς εἰδὼς ὅμως ἀφίημι, καὶ κείσθω διαφεύγειν\r\nαὐτούς, καθάπερ οἴονται, κολακείας οὐκ ἀληθῆ δόξαν, πολλοῖς ἅμα πάθεσιν\r\nἐνόχους φανέντας καὶ νοσήμασιν αἰσχίστοις πάνυ καὶ ἀνελευθέροις. ἢ γὰρ οὐ\r\nσυνιέντες ἀναίσθητοι λίαν εἰσίν, ὧν οὐδαμῶς ἁναίσθητον εἶναι χρῆν, ἢ\r\nσυνιέντες ἐπιλήσμονες ὧν ἐχρῆν εἰς ἅπαντα μεμνῆσθαι τὸν χρόνον· μεμνημένοι\r\nδὲ καὶ ἀποκνοῦντες δι᾽ ἁσδηποτοῦν αἰτίας δειλοὶ καὶ βάσκανοι φύσει καὶ\r\nἁπλῶς ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις δυσμενεῖς, [B] οἵ γε οὐδὲ τοῖς εὐεργέταις πρᾷοι καὶ\r\nπροσηνεῖς ἐθέλοντες εἶναι, εἶτα, ἂν μὲν δέῃ λοιδορῆσαί που καὶ δακεῖν,\r\nὥσπερ τὰ θηρία ὀργίλον καὶ ὀξὺ βλέπουσιν· ὥσπερ δὲ ἀνάλωμα πολυτελὲς\r\nφεύγοντες τὸν ἀληθινὸν ἔπαινον, οὐκ οἶδ᾽ ὅπως, αἰτιῶνται τὰς ὑπὲρ τῶν\r\nκαλῶν ἔργων εὐφημίας, ἐξὸν ἐκεῖνο ἐξετάζειν μόνον, εἰ τὴν ἀλήθειαν τιμῶσι\r\nκαὶ περὶ πλείονος ποιοῦνται [C] τοῦ δοκεῖν ἐν τοῖς ἐπαίνοις χαρίζεσθαι.\r\nοὐδὲ γὰρ τοῦτο ἔνεστιν εἰπεῖν, ὡς ἀνωφελὲς χρῆμα ἡ εὐφημία οὔτε τοῖς ὑπὲρ\r\nὧν γέγονεν οὔτε αὖ τοῖς ἄλλοις, ὁπόσι τὴν ἴσην ἐκείνοις κατὰ τὸν βίον\r\nτάξιν εἰληχότες τῆς ἐν ταῖς πράξεσιν ἀρετῆς ἀπελείφθησαν. τοῖς μὲν γὰρ\r\nἄκουσμά τέ ἐστιν ἡδὺ καὶ προθυμοτέρους παρέχει περὶ τὰ καλὰ καὶ διαφέροντα\r\nτῶν ἔργων· τοὺς δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ ζηλοῦν ἐκεῖνα πειθοῖ καὶ βίᾳ παρώρμησεν ὁρῶντας\r\nὅτι μηδὲ τῶν προλαβόντων τινὲς ἀπεστερήθησαν ὃ μόνον δοῦναί τε καὶ λαβεῖν\r\nἐστι δημοσίᾳ καλόν.

Is it not evident that we\r\nmust think them mean and base? Far more I think than any other crime do we\r\nhate ingratitude, and we blame those persons who have received benefits\r\nand are ungrateful to their benefactors. And the ungrateful man is not\r\nonly he who repays a kindness with evil deeds or words, but also he who is\r\nsilent and conceals a kindness and tries to consign it to oblivion and\r\nabolish gratitude. Now of such brutal and inhuman baseness as the\r\nrepayment with evil the instances are few and easily reckoned; but there\r\nare many who try to conceal the appearance of having received benefits,\r\nthough with what purpose I know not. They assert, however, that it is\r\nbecause they are trying to avoid a reputation for a sort of servility and\r\nfor base flattery. But though I know well enough that what they say is all\r\ninsincere, nevertheless I let that pass, and suppose we assume that they,\r\nas they think, do escape an undeserved reputation for flattery, still they\r\nat the same time appear to be guilty of many weaknesses and defects of\r\ncharacter that are in the highest degree base and illiberal. For either\r\nthey are too dense to perceive what no one should fail to perceive, or\r\nthey are not dense but forgetful of what they ought to remember for all\r\ntime. Or again, they do remember, and yet shirk their duty for some reason\r\nor other, being cowards and grudging by nature, and their hand is against\r\nevery man without exception, seeing that not even to their benefactors do\r\nthey consent to be gentle and amiable; and then if there be any opening to\r\nslander and bite, they look angry and fierce like wild beasts. Genuine\r\npraise they somehow or other avoid giving, as though it were a costly\r\nextravagance, and they censure the applause given to noble actions, when\r\nthe only thing that they need enquire into is whether the eulogists\r\nrespect truth and rate her higher than the reputation of showing their\r\ngratitude by eulogy. For this at any rate they cannot assert, that praise\r\nis a useless thing, either to those who receive it or to others besides,\r\nwho, though they have been assigned the same rank in life as the objects\r\nof their praise, have fallen short of their merit in what they have\r\naccomplished. To the former it is not only agreeable to hear, but makes\r\nthem zealous to aim at a still higher level of conduct, while the latter\r\nit stimulates both by persuasion and compulsion to imitate that noble\r\nconduct, because they see that none of those who have anticipated them\r\nhave been deprived of that which alone it is honourable to give and\r\nreceive publicly. For to give money openly, and to look anxiously round\r\nthat as many as possible may know of the gift, is characteristic of a\r\nvulgar person. Nay no one would even stretch out his hands to receive it\r\nin the sight of all men, unless he had first cast off all propriety of\r\nmanner and sense of shame. Arcesilaus indeed, when offering a gift, used\r\nto try to hide his identity even from the recipient.(497) But in his case\r\nthe manner of the deed always made known the doer. For a eulogy, however,\r\none is ambitious to obtain as many hearers as possible, and even a small\r\naudience is, I think, not to be despised. Socrates, for instance, spoke in\r\npraise of many, as did Plato also and Aristotle. Xenophon, too, eulogised\r\nKing Agesilaus and Cyrus the Persian, not only the elder Cyrus, but him\r\nwhom he accompanied on his campaign against the Great King, nor did he\r\nhide away his eulogies, but put them into his history. Now I should think\r\nit strange indeed if we shall be eager to applaud men of high character,\r\nand not think fit to give our tribute of praise to a noble woman,\r\nbelieving as we do that excellence is the attribute of women no less than\r\nof men. Or shall we who think that such a one ought to be modest and wise\r\nand competent to assign to every man his due, and brave in danger, high‐\r\nminded and generous, and that in a word all such qualities as these should\r\nbe hers,—shall we, I say, then rob her of the encomium due to her good\r\ndeeds, from any fear of the charge of appearing to flatter? But Homer was\r\nnot ashamed to praise Penelope and the consort of Alcinous(498) and other\r\nwomen of exceptional goodness, or even those whose claim to virtue was\r\nslight. Nay nor did Penelope fail to obtain her share of praise for this\r\nvery thing. But besides these reasons for praise, shall we consent to\r\naccept kind treatment from a woman no less than from a man, and to obtain\r\nsome boon whether small or great, and then hesitate to pay the thanks due\r\ntherefor? But perhaps people will say that the very act of making a\r\nrequest to a woman is despicable and unworthy of an honourable and high‐\r\nspirited man, and that even the wise Odysseus was spiritless and cowardly\r\nbecause he was a suppliant to the king’s daughter(499) as she played with\r\nher maiden companions by the banks of the river. Perhaps they will not\r\nspare even Athene the daughter of Zeus, of whom Homer says(500) that she\r\nput on the likeness of a fair and noble maiden and guided him along the\r\nroad that led to the palace, and was his adviser and instructed him what\r\nhe must do and say when he had entered within; and that, like some orator\r\nperfect in the art of rhetoric, she sang an encomium of the queen, and for\r\na prelude told the tale of her lineage from of old. Homer’s verses about\r\nthis are as follows:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Δέσποιναν μὲν πρῶτα κιχήσεαι ἐν μεγάροισιν,\r\n    Ἀρήτη δ᾽ ὄνομ᾽ ἐστὶν ἐπώνυμον, [B] ἐκ δὲ τοκήων\r\n    Τῶν αὐτῶν, οἵπερ τέκον Ἀλκίνοον βασιλῆα.\r\n\r\n    (“The queen thou shalt find first in the halls. Arete is the name\r\n    she is called by, and of the same parents is she as those who\r\n    begat king Alcinous.”(501))\r\n\r\n\r\nἀναλαβὼν δὲ ἄνωθεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος οἶμαι τὴν ἀρχὴν τοῦ γένους καὶ ὅσα\r\nἔδρασάν τε καὶ ἔπαθον εἰπών, καὶ ὅπως αὐτὴν ὁ θεῖος, τοῦ πατρὸς ἀπολομένου\r\nνέου καὶ νυμφίου, ἔγημέ τε καὶ ἐτίμησεν,\r\n\r\n(Then he goes back and begins with Poseidon and tells of the origin of\r\nthat family and all that they did and suffered, and how when her father\r\nperished, still young and newly‐wed, her uncle married her, and honoured\r\nher)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ὡς οὔτις ἐπὶ χθονὶ τίεται ἄλλη,\r\n\r\n    (“As no other woman in the world is honoured,”)\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ ὅσων τυγχάνει                                       C\r\n\r\n(and he tells of all the honour she receives)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἔκ τε φίλων παίδων ἔκ τ᾽ αὐτοῦ Ἀλκινόοιο,\r\n\r\n    (“From her dear children and from Alcinous himself,”)\r\n\r\n\r\nἔπι δὲ οἷμαι τῆς γερουσίας καὶ τοῦ δήμου, οἱ καθάπερ θεὸν ὁρῶσι\r\nπορευομένην διὰ τοῦ ἄστεος, τέλος ἐπέθηκε ταῖς εὐφημίαις ζηλωτὸν ἀνδρὶ καὶ\r\nγυναικί,\r\n\r\n(and from the council of elders also, I think, and from the people who\r\nlook upon her as a goddess as she goes through the city; and on all his\r\npraises he sets this crown, one that man and woman alike may well envy,\r\nwhen he says)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Οὐ μὲν γάρ τι νόου γε καὶ αὐτὴ δεύεται ἐσθλοῦ\r\n\r\n    (“For indeed she too has no lack of excellent understanding,”)\r\n\r\n\r\nλέγων, καὶ ὡς κρίνειν εὖ ἠπίστατο, οἷσίν τ᾽ εὗ φρονέῃσι, [D] καὶ διαλύειν\r\nτὰ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἐγκλήματα τοῖς πολίταις ἀναφυόμενα ξὺν δίκῃ. ταύτην δὴ\r\nοὖν ἱκετεύσας εἰ τύχοις εὔνου, πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔφη,\r\n\r\n(and that she knows well how to judge between men, and, for those citizens\r\nto whom she is kindly disposed, how to reconcile with justice the\r\ngrievances that arise among them.

Shall I then need yet greater\r\ninstances and clearer proofs, so that I may escape the suspicion of\r\nseeming to flatter? Shall I not forthwith imitate that wise and inspired\r\npoet and go on to praise the noble Eusebia, eager as I am to compose an\r\nencomium worthy of her, though I shall be thankful if, even in a moderate\r\ndegree, I succeed in describing accomplishments so many and so admirable?\r\nAnd I shall be thankful if I succeed in describing also those noble\r\nqualities of hers, her temperance, justice, mildness and goodness, or her\r\naffection for her husband, or her generosity about money, or the honour\r\nthat she pays to her own people and her kinsfolk. It is proper for me, I\r\nthink, to follow in the track as it were of what I have already said, and,\r\nas I pursue my panegyric, so arrange it as to give the same order as\r\nAthene, making mention, as is natural, of her native land, her ancestors,\r\nhow she married and whom, and all the rest in the same fashion as Homer.)\r\n\r\nΠερὶ μὲν οὖν τῆς πατρίδος πολλὰ σεμνὰ λέγειν ἔχων, τὰ μὲν διὰ παλαιότητα\r\nπαρήσειν μοι δοκῶ· φαίνεται γὰρ εἶναι τῶν μύθων οὐ πόρρω· [C] ὁποῖον δή τι\r\nκαὶ τὸ περὶ τῶν Μουσῶν λεγόμενον, ὡς εἶεν δήπουθεν ἐκ τῆς Πιερίας, οὐχὶ δὲ\r\nἐξ Ἑλικῶνος εἰς τὸν Ὄλυμπον ἀφίκοιντο παρὰ τὸν πατέρα κληθεῖσαι. τοῦτο μὲν\r\nδὴ καὶ εἰ δή τι τοιοῦτον ἕτερον, μύθῳ μᾶλλον ἢ λόγῳ προσῆκον, ἀπολειπτέον·\r\nὀλίγα δὲ εἰπεῖν τῶν οὐ πᾶσι γνωρίμων τυχὸν οὐκ ἄτοπον οὐδὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ\r\nπαρόντος λόγου.

For it\r\nseems to be not far removed from myth. For instance, the sort of story\r\nthat is told about the Muses, that they actually came from Pieria(506) and\r\nthat it was not from Helicon that they came to Olympus, when summoned to\r\ntheir father’s side. This then, and all else of the same sort, since it is\r\nbetter suited to a fable than to my narrative, must be omitted. But\r\nperhaps it is not out of the way nor alien from my present theme to tell\r\nsome of the facts that are not familiar to all. They say(507) that\r\nMacedonia was colonised by the descendants of Heracles, the sons of\r\nTemenus, who had been awarded Argos as their portion, then quarrelled, and\r\nto make an end of their strife and jealousy led out a colony. Then they\r\nseized Macedonia, and leaving a prosperous family behind them, they\r\nsucceeded to the throne, king after king, as though the privilege were an\r\ninheritance. Now to praise all these would be neither truthful, nor in my\r\nopinion easy. But though many of them were brave men and left behind them\r\nvery glorious monuments of the Hellenic character, Philip and his son\r\nsurpassed in valour all who of old ruled over Macedonia and Thrace, yes\r\nand I should say all who governed the Lydians as well, or the Medes and\r\nPersians and Assyrians, except only the son of Cambyses,(508) who\r\ntransferred the sovereignty from the Medes to the Persians. For Philip was\r\nthe first to try to increase the power of the Macedonians, and when he had\r\nsubdued the greater part of Europe, he made the sea his frontier limit on\r\nthe east and south, and on the north I think the Danube, and on the west\r\nthe people of Oricus,(509) And after him, his son, who was bred up at the\r\nfeet of the wise Stagyrite,(510) so far excelled all the rest in greatness\r\nof soul, and besides, surpassed his own father in generalship and courage\r\nand the other virtues, that he thought that life for him was not worth\r\nliving unless he could subdue all men and all nations. And so he traversed\r\nthe whole of Asia, conquering as he went, and he was the first of men(511)\r\nto adore the rising sun; but as he was setting out for Europe in order to\r\ngain control of the remainder and so become master of the whole earth and\r\nsea, he paid the debt of nature in Babylon. Then Macedonians became the\r\nrulers of all the cities and nations that they had acquired under his\r\nleadership. And now is it still necessary to show by stronger proofs that\r\nMacedonia was famous and great of old? And the most important place in\r\nMacedonia is that city which they restored, after, I think, the fall of\r\nthe Thessalians, and which is called after their victory over them.(512)\r\nBut concerning all this I need not speak at greater length.)\r\n\r\nΕὐγενείας γε μὴν τί ἂν ἔχοιμεν ἔτι πράγματα ἐπιζητοῦντες φανερώτερον καὶ\r\nἐναργὲς μᾶλλον τεκμήριον; θυγάτηρ γάρ ἐστιν ἀνδρὸς ἀξίου νομισθέντος τὴν\r\nἐπώνυμον τοῦ ἔτους ἀρχὴν ἄρχειν,(513) πάλαι [108] μὲν ἰσχυρὰν καὶ\r\nβασιλείαν ἀτεχνῶς ὀνομαζομένην, μεταβαλοῦσαν δὲ διὰ τοὺς οὐκ ὀρθῶς\r\nχρωμένους τῇ δυνάμει τὸ ὄνομα· νῦν δὲ ἤδη τῆς δυνάμεως ἐπιλειπούσης,\r\nἐπειδὴ πρὸς μοναρχίαν τὰ τῆς πολιτείας μεθέστηκε, τιμὴ καθ᾽ αὑτὴν τῶν\r\nἄλλων ἁπάντων στερομένη πρὸς πᾶσαν ἰσχὺν ἀντίρροπος εἶναι δοκεῖ, τοῖς μὲν\r\nἰδιώταις οἷον ἆθλον ἀποκειμένη καὶ γέρας ἀρετῆς ἦ πίστεως ἤ τινος εὐνοίας\r\nκαὶ ὑπηρεσίας περὶ τοὺς τῶν ὅλων ἄρχοντας ἢ πράξεως λαμπρᾶς, [B] τοῖς\r\nβασιλεῦσι δὲ πρὸς οἷς ἔχουσιν ἀγαθοῖς οἷον ἄγαλμα καὶ κόσμος ἐπιτιθεμένη·\r\nτῶν μὲν γὰρ ἄλλων ὀνομάτων τε καὶ ἔργων, ὁπόσα τῆς παλαιᾶς ἐκείνης\r\nπολιτείας διασώζει τινὰ φαύλην καὶ ἀμυδρὰν εἰκόνα, ἢ παντάπασιν\r\nὑπεριδόντες διὰ τὴν ἰσχὺν κατέγνωσαν, ἢ προσιέμενοὶ γε διὰ βίου καρποῦνται\r\nτὰς ἐπωνυμίας· μόνης δέ, οἶμαι, ταύτης οὔτε τὴν ἀρχὴν ὑπερεῖδον, χαίρουσί\r\nτε(514) καὶ πρὸς ἐνιαυτὸν τυγχάνοντες· [C] καὶ οὔτε ἐδιώτης οὐδεὶς οὔτε\r\nβασιλεύς ἐστιν ἢ γέγονεν, ὃς οὐ ζηλωτὸν ἐνόμισεν ὕπατος ἐπονομασθῆναι. εἰ\r\nδέ, ὅτι πρῶτος ὔτυχεν ἐκεῖνος καὶ γέγονεν ἀρχηγὸς τῷ γένει τῆς εὐδοξίας,\r\nἔλαττὸν τις ἔχειν αὐτὸν τῶν ἄλλων ὑπολαμβάνει, λίαν ἐξαπατώμενος οὐ\r\nμανθάνει· τῷ παντὶ γὰρ οἶμαι κρεῖττον ἐστι καὶ σεμνότερον ἀρχὴν παρασχεῖν\r\nτοῖς ἐγγόνοις περιφανείας τοσαύτης [D] ἢ λαβεῖν παρὰ τῶν προγόνων. ἐπεὶ\r\nκαὶ πόλεως μεγίστης οἰκιστὴν γενέσθαι κρεῖττον ἢ πολίτην, καὶ λαβεῖν\r\nὁτιοῦν ἀγαθὸν τοῦ δοῦναι τῷ παντὶ καταδεέστερον. λαμβάνειν δὲ ἐοίκασι παρὰ\r\nτῶν πατέρων οἱ παῖδες καὶ οἱ πολῖται παρὰ τῶν πόλεων οἷον ἁφορμάς τινας\r\nπρὸς εὐδοξίαν. ὅστις δὲ ἀποδίδωσι πάλιν ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ προγόνοις τε καὶ πατρίδι\r\nμείζονα τιμῆς ὑπόθεσιν, λαμπροτέραν μὲν ἐκείνην καὶ σεμνοτέραν, τοὺς\r\nπατέρας δὲ ἐνδοξοτέρους ἀποφαίνων, οὗτος οὐδενὶ δοκεῖ καταλιπεῖν(515) πρὸς\r\nεὐγενείας λόγον ἅμιλλαν· [109] οὐδὲ ἔστιν ὅστις ἐκείνου φήσει κρείττων\r\nγεγονέναι· ἐξ ἀγαθῶν μὲν γὰρ ἀγαθὸν φῦναι χρή. ὁ δὲ ἐξ ἐνδόξων ἐνδοξότερος\r\nγενόμενος, ἐς ταὐτὸν ἀρετῇ τῆς τύχης πνεούσης, οὗτος οὐδενὶ δίδωσιν\r\nἀπορεῖν, εἰ τῆς εὐγενείας εἰκότως μεταποιεῖται.\r\n\r\n(And of her noble birth why should I take any further trouble to seek for\r\nclearer or more manifest proof than this? I mean that she is the daughter\r\nof a man who was considered worthy to hold the office that gives its name\r\nto the year,(516) an office that in the past was powerful and actually\r\ncalled royal, but lost that title because of those who abused their power.\r\nBut now that in these days its power has waned, since the government has\r\nchanged to a monarchy, the bare honour, though robbed of all the rest, is\r\nheld to counterbalance all power, and for private citizens is set up as a\r\nsort of prize and a reward of virtue, or loyalty, or of some favour done\r\nto the ruler of the empire, or for some brilliant exploit, while for the\r\nemperors, it is added to the advantages they already possess as the\r\ncrowning glory and adornment. For all the other titles and functions that\r\nstill retain some feeble and shadowy resemblance to the ancient\r\nconstitution they either altogether despised and rejected, because of\r\ntheir absolute power, or they attached them to themselves and enjoy the\r\ntitles for life. But this office alone, I think, they from the first did\r\nnot despise, and it still gratifies them when they obtain it for the year.\r\nIndeed there is no private citizen or emperor, nor has ever been, who did\r\nnot think it an enviable distinction to be entitled consul. And if there\r\nbe anyone who thinks that, because he I spoke of was the first of his line\r\nto win that title and to lay the foundations of distinction for his\r\nfamily, he is therefore inferior to the others, he fails to understand\r\nthat he is deceived exceedingly. For it is, in my opinion, altogether\r\nnobler and more honourable to lay the foundations of such great\r\ndistinction for one’s descendants than to receive it from one’s ancestors.\r\nFor indeed it is a nobler thing to be the founder of a mighty city than a\r\nmere citizen and to receive any good thing is altogether less dignified\r\nthan to give. Indeed it is evident that sons receive from their fathers,\r\nand citizens from their cities, a start, as it were, on the path of glory.\r\nBut he who by his own effort pays back to his ancestors and his native\r\nland that honour on a higher scale, and makes his country show more\r\nbrilliant and more distinguished, and his ancestors more illustrious,\r\nclearly yields the prize to no man on the score of native nobility. Nor is\r\nthere any man who can claim to be superior to him I speak of. For the good\r\nmust needs be born of good parents. But when the son of illustrious\r\nparents himself becomes more illustrious, and fortune blows the same way\r\nas his merit, he causes no one to feel doubt, if he lays claim, as is\r\nreasonable, to be of native nobility.)\r\n\r\nΕὐσεβία δέ, περὶ ἧς ὁ λόγος, παῖς μὲν ὑπάτου γέγονε, γαμετὴ δέ ἐστι\r\nβασιλέως ἐνδρείου, σώφρονος, συνετοῦ, δικαίου, χρηστοῦ καὶ πρᾴου καὶ\r\nμεγαλοψύχου, [B] ὃς ἐπειδὴ πατρῴαν οὖσαν αὐτῷ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀνεκτήσατο,\r\nἀφελόμενος τοῦ βίᾳ λαβόντος, γάμου τε ἐδεῖτο πρὸς παίδων γένεσιν, οἳ\r\nκληρονομήσουσι τῆς τιμῆς καὶ τῆς ἐξουσίας, ταύτην ἀξίαν ἔκρινε τῆς\r\nκοινωνίας γεγονὼς ἤδη σχεδόν τι τῆς οἰκουμένης ἁπάσης κύριος. καίτοι πῶς\r\nἄν τις μείζονα μαρτυρίαν ἐπιζητήσειε τῆσδε; οὐ μόνον περὶ τῆς εὐγενείας\r\nαὐτῆς, [C] ὑπὲρ δὲ ἁπάντων ἁπλῶς, ὅσα χρῆν οἶμαι τὴν βασιλεῖ τοσούτῳ\r\nσυνιοῦσαν, καθάπερ φερνὴν οἴκοθεν ἐπιφερομένην, κομίζειν ἀγαθά, παιδείαν\r\nὀρθήν, σύνεσιν ἐμμελῆ, ἀκμὴν καὶ ὥραν σώματος καὶ κάλλος τοσοῦτον, ὥστε\r\nἀποκρύπτεσθαι τᾶς ἄλλας παρθένους, καθάπερ οἶμαι περὶ τῇ σελήνῃ πληθούσῃ\r\nοἱ διαφανεῖς ἀστέρες καταυγαζόμενοι κρύπτουσι τὴν μορφὴν. ἓν μὲν γὰρ\r\nτούτων οὐδὲν(517) ἐξαρκεῖν δοκεῖ πρὸς κοινωνίαν βασιλέως, πάντα δὲ ἅμα,\r\n[D] ὥσπερ θεοῦ τινος ἀγαθῷ βασιλεῖ καλὴν καὶ σώφρονα πλάττοντος τὴν\r\nνύμφην, εἰς ταὐτὸ συνεληλυθότα πόρρωθεν καὶ οὐκ ἀπὸ τῶν ὀμμάτων\r\nἐφελκυσάμενα μάλα ὄλβιον ἦγε τὸν νυμφίον. κάλλος μὲν γὰρ τῆς ἐκ τοῦ γένους\r\nβοηθείας καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἀγαθῶν οἶμαι στερόμενον οὐδὲ ἰδιώτην ἀκόλαστον\r\nἰσχύει πείθειν τὴν γαμήλιον ἀνάψαι λαμπάδα, ἄμφω δὲ ἅμα συνελθόντα γάμον\r\nμὲν ἧρμοσε πολλάκις, ἀπολειπόμενα δὲ [110] τῆς ἐκ τῶν τρόπων ἁρμονίας καὶ\r\nχάριτος οὐ λίαν ἐφάνη ζηλωτά.\r\n\r\n(Now Eusebia, the subject of my speech, was the daughter of a consul, and\r\nis the consort of an Emperor who is brave, temperate, wise, just,\r\nvirtuous, mild and high‐souled, who, when he acquired the throne that had\r\nbelonged to his ancestors, and had won it back from him who had usurped it\r\nby violence, and desired to wed that he might beget sons to inherit his\r\nhonour and power, deemed this lady worthy of his alliance, when he had\r\nalready become master of almost the whole world. And indeed why should one\r\nsearch for stronger evidence than this? Evidence, I mean, not only of her\r\nnative nobility, but of all those combined gifts which she who is united\r\nto so great an Emperor ought to bring with her from her home as a dowry,\r\nwit and wisdom, a body in the flower of youth, and beauty so conspicuous\r\nas to throw into the shade all other maidens beside, even as, I believe,\r\nthe radiant stars about the moon at the full are outshone and hide their\r\nshape.(518) For no single one of these endowments is thought to suffice\r\nfor an alliance with an Emperor, but all together, as though some god were\r\nfashioning for a virtuous Emperor a fair and modest bride, were united in\r\nher single person and, attracting not his eyes alone, brought from afar\r\nthat bridegroom blest of heaven. For beauty alone, if it lacks the support\r\nof birth and the other advantages I have mentioned, is not enough to\r\ninduce even a licentious man, a mere citizen, to kindle the marriage\r\ntorch, though both combined have brought about many a match, but when they\r\noccur without sweetness and charm of character they are seen to be far\r\nfrom desirable.)\r\n\r\nΤαῦτα ἐπιστάμενον σαφῶς τὸν βασιλέα τὸν σώφρονα φαίην ἂν εἰκότως πολλάκις\r\nβουλευσάμενον ἑλέσθαι τὸν γάμον, τὰ μὲν οἶμαι πυνθανόμενον, ὅσα χρῆν δι᾽\r\nἀκοῆς περὶ αὐτῆς μαθεῖν, τεκμαιρόμενον δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς μητρὸς τὴν εὐταξίαν·\r\nὑπὲρ ἧς τὰ μὲν ἄλλα τί δεῖ λέγοντας διατρίβειν, καθάπερ οὐκ ἔχοντας ἴδιον\r\nἐγκώμιον τῆς,(519) ὑπὲρ ἧς ὁ λόγος, [B] διελθεῖν; τοσοῦτον δὲ ἴσως οὔτε\r\nεἰπεῖν οὔτε ἐπακοῦσαι πολὺ καὶ ἐργῶδες, ὅτι δὴ γένος μὲν αὐτῇ σφόδρα\r\nἙλληνικόν, Ἑλλήνων τῶν πάνυ, καὶ πόλις ἡ μητρόπολις τῆς Μακεδονίας,\r\nσωφροσύνη δὲ ὑπέρ τε Εὐάδνην τὴν Καπανέως καὶ τὴν Θετταλὴν ἐκείνην\r\nΛαοδάμειαν. αἱ μὲν γὰρ καλοὺς καὶ νέους καὶ ἔτι νυμφίους τοὺς ἄνδρας\r\nἀφαιρεθεῖσαι διαμόνων βίᾳ βασκάνων ἢ μοιρῶν νήμασι τοῦ ζῆν ὑπερεῖδον διὰ\r\nτὸν ἔρωτα, ἡ δέ, [C] ἐπειδὴ τὸ χρεὼν τὸν κουρίδιον αὐτῆς ἄνδρα κατέλαβε,\r\nτοῖς παισὶ προσκαθημένη τοσοῦτον ἐπὶ σωφροσύνῃ κλέος αὑτῇ εἰργάσατο, ὥστε\r\nτῇ μὲν Πηνελόπῃ περιόντος ἔτι καὶ πλανωμένου τοῦ γήμαντος, προσῄει τὰ\r\nμειράκια μνηστευσόμενα ἔκ τε Ἰθάκης καὶ Σάμου καὶ Δουλιχίου, τῇ δὲ ἀνὴρ\r\nμὲν οὐδεὶς καλὸς καὶ μέγας ἢ ἰσχυρὸς καὶ πλούσιος ὑπὲρ(520) τούτων εἰς\r\nλόγους ἐλθεῖν ὑπέμεινέ ποτε· τὴν θυγατέρα δὲ βασιλεὺς ἑαυτῷ συνοικεῖν\r\nἀξίαν ἔκρινε, [D] καὶ ἔδρασε τὸν γάμον λαμπρῶς μετὰ τὰ τρόπαια, ἔθνη καὶ\r\nπόλεις καὶ δήμους(521) ἑστιῶν.\r\n\r\n(I have good reason to say that the Emperor in his prudence understood\r\nthis clearly, and that it was only after long deliberation that he chose\r\nthis marriage, partly making enquiries about all that was needful to learn\r\nabout her by hearsay, but judging also from her mother of the daughter’s\r\nnoble disposition. Of that mother why should I take time to say more, as\r\nthough I had not to recite a special encomium on her who is the theme of\r\nmy speech? But so much perhaps I may say briefly and you may hear without\r\nweariness, that her family is entirely Greek, yes Greek of the purest\r\nstock, and her native city was the metropolis of Macedonia, and she was\r\nmore self‐controlled than Evadne(522) the wife of Capaneus, and the famous\r\nLaodameia(523) of Thessaly. For these two, when they had lost their\r\nhusbands, who were young, handsome and still newly‐wed, whether by the\r\nconstraint of some envious powers, or because the threads of the fates\r\nwere so woven, threw away their lives for love. But the mother of the\r\nEmpress, when his fate had come upon her wedded lord, devoted herself to\r\nher children, and won a great reputation for prudence, so great indeed,\r\nthat whereas Penelope, while her husband was still on his travels and\r\nwanderings, was beset by those young suitors who came to woo her from\r\nIthaca and Samos and Dulichium, that lady no man however fair and tall or\r\npowerful and wealthy ever ventured to approach with any such proposals.\r\nAnd her daughter the Emperor deemed worthy to live by his side, and after\r\nsetting up the trophies of his victories, he celebrated the marriage with\r\ngreat splendour, feasting nations and cities and peoples.)\r\n\r\nΕἰ δέ τις ἄρα ἐκείνων ἐπακούειν ποθεῖ, ὅπως μὲν ἐκ Μακεδονίας ἐκαλεῖτο\r\nμετὰ τῆς μητρὸς ἡ νύμφη, τίς δὲ ἧν ὁ τῆς πομπῆς τρόπος, ἁρμάτων καὶ ἵππων\r\nκαὶ ὀχημάτων παντοδαπῶν χρυσῷ καὶ ἀργύρῳ καὶ ὀρειχάλκῳ μετὰ τῆς ἀρίστης\r\nτέχνης εἰργασμένων, ἴστω παιδικῶν σφόδρα ἀκουσμάτων ἐπιθυμῶν· [111]\r\nκαθάπερ γὰρ οἶμαι κιθαρῳδοῦ τινος δεξιοῦ τὴν τέχνην· ἔστω δέ, εἰ βούλει,\r\nΤέρπανδρος οὗτος ἢ ὁ Μηθυμναῖος ἐκεῖνος, ὃν δὴ λόγος ἔχει δαιμονίᾳ πομπῇ\r\nχρησάμενον φιλομουσοτέρου τοῦ δελφῖνος τυχεῖν ἢ τῶν ξυμπλεόντων, καὶ ἐπὶ\r\nτὴν Λακωνικὴν ἄκραν κομισθῆναι· ἔθελγε γὰρ οἶμαι τοὺς δυστυχεῖς ναύτας ὅσα\r\nἐκεῖνος ἀπὸ τῆς τέχνης εἰργάσατο, αὐτῆς δὲ ἐκείνης ὑπερεώρων καὶ οὐδεμίαν\r\nὤραν ἐποιοῦντο τῆς μουσικῆς· [B] εἰ δὴ οὖν τις τοῖν ἀνδροῖν ἐκείνοιν τὸν\r\nκράτιστον ἐπιλεξάμενος καὶ ἀποδοὺς τὸν περὶ τὸ σῶμα κόσμον τῇ τέχνῃ\r\nπρέποντα εἶτα ἐς θέατρον παραγάγοι παντοδαπῶν ἀνδρῶν καὶ γυναικῶν καὶ\r\nπαίδων φύσει τε καὶ ἡλικίᾳ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐπιτηδεύμασι διαφερόντων, οὐκ\r\nἂν οἴεσθε τοὺς μὲν παῖδας καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν καὶ γυναικῶν(524) ὁπόσοι τοιοῦτοι\r\nεἰς τὴν ἐσθῆτα καὶ τὴν κιθάραν ἀποβλέποντας ἐκπεπλῆχθαι δεινῶς πρὸς τὴν\r\nὄψιν, τῶν ἀνδρῶν δὲ τοὺς ἀμαθεστέρους καὶ γυναικῶν πλὴν σφόδρα ὀλίγων ἅπαν\r\nτὸ πλῆθος ἡδονῇ [C] καὶ λύπῃ κρίνειν τὰ κρούματα, μουσικὸν δὲ ἄνδρα, τοὺς\r\nνόμους(525) ἐξεπιστάμενον τῆς τέχνης, οὔτε μιγνύμενα τὰ μέλη τῆς ἡδονῆς\r\nχάριν φαύλως ἀνέχεσθαι, δυσχεραίνειν τε(526) καὶ εἰ(527) τοὺς τρόπους τῆς\r\nμουσικῆς διαφθείροι καὶ εἰ ταῖς ἁρμονίαις μὴ δεόντως χρῷτο μηδὲ ἑπομένως\r\nτοῖς νόμοις τῆς ἀληθινῆς καὶ θείας μουσικῆς; ὁρῶν δὲ ἐμμένοντα τοῖς\r\nνομισθεῖσι καὶ οὐ κίβδηλον ἡδονήν, καθαρὰν δὲ [D] καὶ ἀκήρατον τοῖς\r\nθεαταῖς ἐνεργασάμενον ἄπεισι τοῦτον ἐπαινῶν καὶ ἐκπληττόμενος, ὄτι δὴ σὺν\r\nτέχνῃ μηδὲν ἀδικῶν τὰς Μούσας τῷ θεάτρῳ ξυγγέγονε. τὸν δὲ τὴν ἁλουργίδα\r\nκαὶ τὴν κιθάραν ἐπαινοῦντα ληρεῖν οἴεται καὶ ἀνοηταίνειν· καὶ εἰ διὰ\r\nπλείονων(528) τὰ τοιαῦτα διηγεῖται, λέξει τε ἡδίστῃ κοσμῶν καὶ ἐπιλεαίνων\r\nτὸ φαῦλον καὶ ἀγεννὲς τῶν διηγημάτων, γελοιότερον νομίζει [112] τῶν\r\nἀποτορνείειν τὰς κέγχρους ἐπιχειρούντων, καθάπερ οἶμαι φασὶ τὸν Μυρμηκίδην\r\nἀντιταττόμενον τῇ Φειδίου τέχνῃ. οὔκουν οὐδὲ ἡμεῖς ἑκόντες αὑτοὺς ταύταις\r\nὑποθήσομεν ταῖς αἰτίαις, ἱματίων πολυτελῶν καὶ δώρων παντοίων ὅρμων τε καὶ\r\nστεφάνων κατάλογον τῶν ἐκ βασιλέως μακρόν τινα τοῦτον ᾄδοντες, οὐδὲ ὡς\r\nἀπήντων οἱ δῆμοι δεξιούμενοι καὶ χαίροντες, οὐδὲ ὅσα κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἐκείνην\r\nλαμπρὰ καὶ ζηλωτὰ γέγονε καὶ ἐνομίσθη.

It is like the case of some player on the cithara who is an\r\naccomplished artist—let us say if you please Terpander or he of\r\nMethymna(529) of whom the story goes that he enjoyed a divine escort and\r\nfound that the dolphin cared more for music than did his fellow‐voyagers,\r\nand was thus conveyed safely to the Laconian promontory.(530) For though\r\nhe did indeed charm those miserable sailors by his skilful performance,\r\nyet they despised his art and paid no heed to his music. Now, as I was\r\ngoing to say, if some one were to choose the best of those two musicians,\r\nand were to clothe him in the raiment suited to his art, and were then to\r\nbring him into a theatre full of men, women and children of all sorts,\r\nvarying in temperament and age and habits besides, do you not suppose that\r\nthe children and those of the men and women who had childish tastes would\r\ngaze at his dress and his lyre, and be marvellously smitten with his\r\nappearance, while the more ignorant of the men, and the whole crowd of\r\nwomen, except a very few, would judge his playing simply by the criterion\r\nof pleasure or the reverse; whereas a musical man who understood the rules\r\nof the art would not endure that the melodies should be wrongly mixed for\r\nthe sake of giving pleasure, but would resent it if the player did not\r\npreserve the modes of the music and did not use the harmonies properly,\r\nand conformably to the laws of genuine and inspired music? But if he saw\r\nthat he was faithful to the principles of his art and produced in the\r\naudience a pleasure that was not spurious but pure and uncontaminated, he\r\nwould go home praising the musician, and filled with admiration because\r\nhis performance in the theatre was artistic and did the Muses no wrong.\r\nBut such a man thinks that anyone who praises the purple raiment and the\r\nlyre is foolish and out of his mind, while, if he goes on to give full\r\ndetails about such outward things, adorning them with an agreeable style\r\nand smoothing away all that is worthless and vulgar in the tale, then the\r\ncritic thinks him more ridiculous than those who try to carve cherry‐\r\nstones,(531) as I believe is related of Myrmecides(532) who thus sought to\r\nrival the art of Pheidias. And so neither will I, if I can help it, lay\r\nmyself open to this charge by reciting the long list of costly robes and\r\ngifts of all kinds and necklaces and garlands that were sent by the\r\nEmperor, nor how the folk in each place came to meet her with welcome and\r\nrejoicing, nor all the glorious and auspicious incidents that occurred on\r\nthat journey, and were reported. But when she entered the palace and was\r\nhonoured with her imperial title, what was the first thing she did and\r\nthen the second and the third and the many actions that followed? For\r\nhowever much I might wish to tell of them and to compose lengthy volumes\r\nabout them, I think that, for the majority, those of her deeds will be\r\nsufficient that more conspicuously witnessed to her wisdom and clemency\r\nand modesty and benevolence and goodness and generosity and her other\r\nvirtues, than does now the present account of her, which tries to\r\nenlighten and instruct those who have long known it all from personal\r\nexperience. For it would not be at all proper, merely because the task has\r\nproved to be difficult or rather impossible, to keep silence about the\r\nwhole, but one should rather try, as far as one can, to tell about those\r\ndeeds, and to bring forward as a proof of her wisdom and of all her other\r\nvirtues the fact that she made her husband regard her as it is fitting\r\nthat he should regard a beautiful and noble wife.)\r\n\r\nὭστε ἔγωγε τῆς Πηνελόπης πολλὰ καὶ ἄλλα νομίσας ἐπαίνων ἄξια [D] τοῦτο ἐν\r\nτοῖς μάλιστα θαυμάζω, ὅτι δὴ τὸν ἄνδρα λίαν ἔπειθε στέργειν καὶ ἀγαπᾶν\r\nαὑτὴν ὑπερορῶντα μέν, ὡς φασί, δαιμονίων γάμων, ἀτιμάζοντα δὲ οὐ μεῖον τὴν\r\nτῶν Φαιάκων ξυγγένειαν.

And yet they were all in love with him, Calypso, Circe,\r\nNausicaa. And they had very beautiful palaces and gardens and parks\r\nwithal, planted with wide‐spreading and shady trees, and meadows gay with\r\nflowers, in which soft grass grew deep: “And four fountains in a row\r\nflowed with shining water.”(533))\r\n\r\nΚρῆναι δ᾽ ἑξείης πίσυρες ῥέον ὕδατι λευκῷ· καὶ ἐτεθήλει περὶ τὴν οἰκίαν\r\nἡμερὶς ἡβώωσα(534) σταφυλῆς οἶμαι τῆς γενναίας, βριθομένη τοῖς βότρυσι·\r\nκαὶ παρὰ τοῖς Φαίαξιν ἕτερα τοιαῦτα, πλὴν ὅσῳ πολυτελέστερα, [B] ἅτε οἶμαι\r\nποιητὰ ξὺν τέχνῃ, τῆς τῶν αὐτοφυῶν ἄλαττον μετεῖχε χάριτος καὶ ἧττον εἶναι\r\nἐδόκει ἐκείνων ἐράσμια. τῆς τρυφῆς δὲ αὖ καὶ τοῦ πλούτου καὶ προσέτι τῆς\r\nπερὶ τὰς νήσους ἐκείνας εἰρήνης καὶ ἡσυχίας τίνα οὐκ ἂν ἡττηθῆναι\r\nδοκεῖτε(535) τοσούτους ἀνατλάντα πόνους καὶ κινδύνους καὶ ἔτι ὑφορώμενον\r\nδεινότερα(536) πείσεσθαι, τὰ μὲν ἐν θαλάττῃ τὰ δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτῆς,\r\n[C] πρὸς ἑκατὸν νεανίσκους ἡβῶντας εὖ μάλα μόνον ἀγωνίζεσθαι μέλλοντα,\r\nὅπερ οὐδὲ ἐν Τροίᾳ ἐκείνῳ ποτὲ συνηνέχθη; εἴ τις οὖν ἔροιτο τὸν Ὀδυσσέα\r\nπαίζων ὧδέ πως· τί ποτε, ὦ σοφώτατε ῥῆτορ ἦ στρατηγὲ ἦ ὅ τι χρή σε\r\nὀνομάζειν, τοσούτους ἑκὼν ὑπέμεινας πόνους, ἐξὸν εἶναι ὄλβιον καὶ\r\nεὐδαίμονα, τυχὸν δὲ καὶ ἀθάνατον εἴ τι χρὴ ταῖς ἐπαγγελίαις Καλυψοῦς\r\nπιστεύειν, σὺ δὲ ἑλόμενος τὰ χείρω πρὸ τῶν βελτιόνων τοσούτους σαυτῷ\r\nπροστέθεικας πόνους, οὐδὲ ἐν τῇ Σχερίᾳ καταμεῖναι ἐθελήσας, [D] ἐξὸν ἐκεῖ\r\nπου παυσάμενον τῆς πλάνης καὶ τῶν κινδύνων ἀπηλλάχθαι· σὺ δὲ ἡμῖν ἐπὶ τῆς\r\nοἰκίας ἔγνως στρατεύεσθαι καὶ ἄθλους δή τινας καὶ ἀποδημίαν ἑτέραν\r\nἐκτελεῖν οὔτι τῆς πρόσθεν, ὥς γε τὸ εἰκὸς ἀπονωτέραν οὐδὲ κουφοτέραν. τί\r\nδὴ οὖν οἴεσθε πρὸς ταῦτα ἐκεῖνον εἰπεῖν ἔχειν; ἆρ᾽ οὐχ ὅτι τῇ Πηνελόπῃ\r\nσυνεῖναι ἐθέλων τοὺς ἄθλους αὐτῇ καὶ τὰς στρατείας χαρίεντα διηγήματα\r\nφέρειν ὑπέλαβε; ταῦτά τοι καὶ τὴν μητέρα πεποίηκεν αὐτῷ παραινοῦσαν\r\nμεμνῆσθαι πάντων, [114] ὧν τε εἶδε θεαμάτων καὶ ὧν ἤκουσεν ἀκουσμάτων,\r\n\r\n(And a lusty wild vine bloomed about her dwelling,(537) with bunches of\r\nexcellent grapes, laden with clusters. And at the Phaeacian court there\r\nwere the same things, except that they were more costly, seeing that, as I\r\nsuppose, they were made by art, and hence had less charm and seemed less\r\nlovely than those that were of natural growth. Now to all that luxury and\r\nwealth, and moreover to the peace and quiet that surrounded those islands,\r\nwho do you think would not have succumbed, especially one who had endured\r\nso great toils and dangers and expected that he would have to suffer still\r\nmore terrible hardships, partly by sea and partly in his own house, since\r\nhe had to fight all alone against a hundred youths in their prime, a thing\r\nwhich had never happened to him even in the land of Troy? Now if someone\r\nin jest were to question Odysseus somewhat in this fashion: “Why, O most\r\nwise orator or general, or whatever one must call you, did you endure so\r\nmany toils, when you might have been prosperous and happy and perhaps even\r\nimmortal, if one may at all believe the promises of Calypso? But you chose\r\nthe worse instead of the better, and imposed on yourself all those\r\nhardships(538) and refused to remain even in Scheria, though you might\r\nsurely have rested there from your wandering and been delivered from your\r\nperils; but behold you resolved to carry on the war in your own house and\r\nto perform feats of valour and to accomplish a second journey, not less\r\ntoilsome, as seemed likely, nor easier than the first!” What answer then\r\ndo you think he would give to this? Would he not answer that he longed\r\nalways to be with Penelope, and that those contests and campaigns he\r\npurposed to take back to her as a pleasant tale to tell? For this reason,\r\nthen, he makes his mother exhort him to remember everything, all the\r\nsights he saw and all the things he heard, and then she says:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ἵνα καὶ μετόπισθε τεῇ εἴπῃσθα γυναικί,\r\n\r\n    (“So that in the days to come thou mayst tell it to thy\r\n    wife.”(539))\r\n\r\n\r\nφησίν. ὁ δὲ οὐδενὸς ἐπιλαθόμενος, ἐπειδὴ πρῶτον ἀφίκετο καὶ τῶν μειρακίων\r\nἐπὶ τὰ βασίλεια κωμαζόντων ἐκράτει ξὺν δίκῃ, πάντα ἀθρόως αὐτῇ διηγεῖτο,\r\nὅσα τε ἔδρασε καὶ ὅσα ἀνέτλη, καὶ εἰ δὴ τι ἄλλο ὑπὸ τῶν χρησμῶν\r\nἀναπειθόμενος ἐκτελεῖν διενοεῖτο· ἀπόρρητον δὲ ἐποιεῖτο πρὸς αὐτὴν οὐδὲ\r\nἕν, [B] ἀλλ᾽ ἠξίου κοινωνὸν γίγνεσθαι τῶν βουλευμάτων καὶ ὅ,τι πρακτέον\r\nεἴη συννοεῖν καὶ συνεξευρίσκειν. ἆρα τοῦτο ὑμῖν τῆς Πηνελόπης ὀλίγον\r\nἐγκώμιον δοκεῖ, ἢ ἤδη(540) τις ἄλλη τὴν ἐκείνης ἀρετὴν ὑπερβαλλομένη\r\nγαμετή τε οὖσα βασιλέως ἀνδρείου καὶ μεγαλοψύχου καὶ σώφρονος τοσαύτην\r\nεὔνοιαν ἐνεποίησεν αὑτῆς τῷ γήμαντι, [C] συγκερασαμένη τῇ παρὰ τῶν ἐρώτων\r\nἐπιπνεομένῃ φιλίᾳ τὴν ἐκ τῆς ἀρετῆς καθάπερ ῥεῦμα θεῖον ἐπιφερομένην ταῖς\r\nἀγαθαῖς καὶ γενναίαις ψυχαῖς; δύο γὰρ δὴ τώδε τινὲ πίθω(541) φιλίας ἔστον,\r\nὧν ἥδε κατ᾽ ἴσον ἀρυσαμένη βουλευμάτων τε αὐτῷ γέγονε κοινωνὸς καὶ πρᾷον\r\nὄντα φύσει τὸν βασιλέα καὶ χρηστὸν καὶ εὐγνώμονα πρὸς ἃ πέφυκε παρακαλεῖ\r\nμᾶλλον πρεπόντως καὶ πρὸς συγγνώμην τὴν δίκην τρέπει. ὥστε οὐκ ἂν τις\r\nεἰπεῖν ἔχοι, ὅτωι γέγονεν ἡ βασιλὶς ἥδε ἐν δίκῃ τυχὸν ἢ καὶ παρὰ δίκην\r\nαἰτία τιμωρίας καὶ κολάσεως μικρᾶς ἢ μείζονος.

And do you think this a trifling tribute to\r\nPenelope, or is there not now found to be yet another woman whose virtue\r\nsurpasses hers, and who, as the consort of a brave, magnanimous and\r\nprudent Emperor, has won as great affection from her husband, since she\r\nhas mingled with the tenderness that is inspired by love that other which\r\ngood and noble souls derive from their own virtue, whence it flows like a\r\nsacred fount? For there are two jars,(548) so to speak, of these two kinds\r\nof human affection, and Eusebia drew in equal measure from both, and so\r\nhas come to be the partner of her husband’s counsels, and though the\r\nEmperor is by nature merciful, good and wise, she encourages him to follow\r\nyet more becomingly his natural bent, and ever turns justice to mercy. So\r\nthat no one could ever cite a case in which this Empress, whether with\r\njustice, as might happen, or unjustly, has ever been the cause of\r\npunishment or chastisement either great or small. Now we are told that at\r\nAthens, in the days when they employed their ancestral customs and lived\r\nin obedience to their own laws, as the inhabitants of a great and humane\r\ncity, whenever the votes of the jurymen were cast evenly for defendant and\r\nplaintiff, the vote of Athene(549) was awarded to him who would have\r\nincurred the penalty, and thus both were acquitted of guilt, he who had\r\nbrought the accusation, of the reputation of sycophant, and the defendant,\r\nnaturally, of the guilt of the crime. Now this humane and gracious custom\r\nis kept up in the suits which the Emperor judges, but Eusebia’s mercy goes\r\nfurther. For whenever the defendant comes near to obtaining an equal\r\nnumber of votes, she persuades the Emperor, adding her request and\r\nentreaty on his behalf, to acquit the man entirely of the charge. And of\r\nfree will with willing heart he grants the boon, and does not give it as\r\nHomer says Zeus, constrained by his wife, agreed as to what he should\r\nconcede to her “of free will but with soul unwilling.”(550) And perhaps it\r\nis not strange that he should concede this pardon reluctantly and under\r\nprotest in the case of the violent and depraved. But not even when men\r\nrichly deserve to suffer and be punished ought they to be utterly ruined.\r\nNow since the Empress recognises this, she has never bidden him inflict\r\nany injury of any kind, or any punishment or chastisement even on a single\r\nhousehold of the citizens, much less on a whole kingdom or city. And I\r\nmight add, with the utmost confidence that I am speaking the absolute\r\ntruth, that in the case of no man or woman is it possible to charge her\r\nwith any misfortune that has happened, but all the benefits that she\r\nconfers and has conferred, and on whom, I would gladly recount in as many\r\ncases as possible, and report them one by one, how for instance this man,\r\nthanks to her, enjoys his ancestral estate, and that man has been saved\r\nfrom punishment, though he was guilty in the eyes of the law, how a third\r\nescaped a malicious prosecution, though he came within an ace of the\r\ndanger, how countless persons have received honour and office at her\r\nhands. And on this subject there is no one of them all who will assert\r\nthat I speak falsely, even though I should not give a list of those\r\npersons by name. But this I hesitate to do, lest I should seem to some to\r\nbe reproaching them with their sufferings, and to be composing not so much\r\nan encomium of her good deeds as a catalogue of the misfortunes of others.\r\nAnd yet, not to cite any of these acts of hers, and to bring no proof of\r\nthem before the public seems perhaps to imply that they are lacking, and\r\nbrings discredit on my encomium. Accordingly, to deprecate that charge, I\r\nshall relate so much as it is not invidious for me to speak or for her to\r\nhear.)\r\n\r\nἘπειδὴ γὰρ τὴν τοῦ γήμαντος εὔνοιαν τηλαυγέστατον πρόσωπον, κατὰ τὸν σοφὸν\r\nΠίνδαρον, ἀρχομένη τῶν ἔργων ἔθετο, γένος τε ἅπαν καὶ ξυγγενεῖς εὐθὺς\r\nἐνέπλησε τιμῆς, τοὺς μὲν ἤδη γνωρίμους καὶ πρεσβυτέρους ἐπὶ μειζόνων\r\nτάττουσα πράξεων καὶ ἀποφήνασα μακαρίους καὶ ζηλωτοὺς βασιλεῖ τ᾽ ἐποίησε\r\nφίλους καὶ τῆς εὐτυχίας τῆς παρούσης ἔδωκε τὴν ἀρχήν.

And if anyone thinks, what is in\r\nfact true, that on their own account they are worthy of honour, he will\r\napplaud her all the more. For it is evident that it was their merit, far\r\nmore than the ties of kinship, that she rewarded; and one could hardly pay\r\nher a higher compliment than that. Such then was her treatment of these.\r\nAnd to all who, since they were still obscure on account of their youth,\r\nneeded recognition of any sort, she awarded lesser honours. In fact she\r\nleft nothing undone to help one and all. And not only on her kinsfolk has\r\nshe conferred such benefits, but whenever she learned that ties of\r\nfriendship used to exist with her ancestors, she has not allowed it to be\r\nunprofitable to those who owned such ties, but she honours them, I\r\nunderstand, no less than her own kinsfolk, and to all whom she regards as\r\nher father’s friends she dispensed wonderful rewards for their\r\nfriendship.)\r\n\r\nἘγὲ δέ, ἐπειδή μοι τεκμηρίων καθάπερ ἐν δικαστηρίῳ τὸν λόγον ὁρῶ δεόμενον,\r\nαὐτὸς ὑμῖν ἐμαυτὸν τούτων ἐκείνῳ(552) μάρτυρα καὶ ἐπαινέτην παρέξομαι·\r\nἀλλ᾽ ὅπως μου μή ποτε ὑπιδόμενοι τὴν μαρτυρίαν πρὶν ἐπακοῦσαι τῶν λόγων\r\nδιαταράττησθε, ὄμνυμι ὑμῖν, ὡς οὐδὲν ψεῦδος οὐδὲ πλάσμα ἐρῶ· ὑμεῖς δὲ κἂν\r\nἀνωμότῳ ἐπιστεύσατε πάντα οὐ κολακείας ἕνεκα λέγειν(553).

But lest you should mistrust my evidence and cause a\r\ndisturbance before you have heard what I have to say, I swear that I will\r\ntell you no falsehood or fiction; although you would have believed, even\r\nwithout an oath, that I am saying all this without intent to flatter. For\r\nI already possess, by the grace of God and the Emperor, and because the\r\nEmpress too was zealous in my behalf, all those blessings to gain which a\r\nflatterer would leave nothing unsaid, so that, if I were speaking before\r\nobtaining these, perhaps I should have to dread that unjust suspicion. But\r\nas it is, since this is the state of my fortunes, I will recall her\r\nconduct to me, and at the same time give you a proof of my own right‐\r\nmindedness and truthful evidence of her good deeds. I have heard that\r\nDarius, while he was still in the bodyguard of the Persian monarch,(555)\r\nmet, in Egypt, a Samian stranger(556) who was an exile from his own\r\ncountry, and accepted from him the gift of a scarlet cloak to which Darius\r\nhad taken a great fancy, and that later on, in the days when, I\r\nunderstand, he had become the master of all Asia, he gave him in return\r\nthe tyranny of Samos. And now suppose that I acknowledge that, though I\r\nreceived many kindnesses at Eusebia’s hands, at a time when I was still\r\npermitted to live in peaceful obscurity, and many also, by her\r\nintercession, from our noble and magnanimous Emperor, I must needs fall\r\nshort of making an equal return; for as I know, she possesses everything\r\nalready, as the gift of him who was so generous to myself; yet since I\r\ndesire that the memory of her good deeds should be immortal, and since I\r\nam relating them to you, perhaps I shall not be thought less mindful of my\r\ndebt than the Persian, seeing that in forming a judgment it is to the\r\nintention that one must look, and not to an instance in which fortune\r\ngranted a man the power to repay his obligation many times over.)\r\n\r\n[D] Τί ποτε οὖν ἐγὼ τοσοῦτον εὖ παθεῖν φημι καὶ ἀνθ᾽ ὅτου τὸν ἄπαντα\r\nχρόνον ὑπόχρεων ἀμαυτὸν εἶναι χάριτος ὁμολογῶ τῇδε, σφόδρα ὥρμησθε\r\nἀκούειν. ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ ἀποκρύψομαι· ἐμοὶ γὰρ βασιλεὺς οὑτοσὶ σχεδὸν ἐκ παιδὸς\r\nνηπίου γεγονὼς ἤπιος πᾶσαν ὑπερεβάλλετο φιλοτιμίαν, κινδύνων τε ἐξαρπάσας\r\nτηλικούτων, οὓς οὐδ᾽ ἂν ἡβῶν ἀνὴρ εὖ μάλα διαφύγοι, [118] μὴ θείας τινὸς\r\nκαὶ ἀμηχάνου σωτηρίας τυχών, εἶτα τὴν οἰκίαν καταληφθεῖσαν καθάπερ ἐπ᾽\r\nἐρημίας παρά τοῦ τῶν δυναστῶν ἀφείλετο ξὺν δίκῃ καὶ ἀπέφηνεν αὖθις\r\nπλούσιον. καὶ ἄλλα ἂν ἔχοιμι περὶ αὐτοῦ πρὸς ὑμᾶς εἰπεῖν εἰς ἐμαυτὸν ἔργα\r\nπολλῆς ἄξια χάριτος, ὑπὲρ ὧν τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον εὔνουν ἐμαυτὸν ἐκείνῳ καὶ\r\nπιστὸν παρέχων οὐκ οἶδα ἐκ τίνος [B] αἰτίας τραχυτέρως ἔχοντος ᾐσθόμην\r\nἔναγχος. ἡ δὲ ἐπειδὴ τὸ πρῶτον ἤκουσεν ἀδικήματος μὲν οὐδενὸς ὄνομα,\r\nματαίας δὲ ἄλλως ὑποψίας, ἠξίου διελέγχειν καὶ μὴ πρότερον προσέσθαι μηδὲ\r\nἐνδέξασθαι ψευδῆ καὶ ἄδικον διαβολήν, καὶ οὐκ ἀνῆκε ταῦτα δεομένη πρὶν ἐμὲ\r\nἤγαγεν ἐς ὄψιν τὴν βασιλέως καὶ τυχεῖν ἐποίησε λόγου· καὶ ἀπολυομένῳ πᾶσαν\r\nαἰτίαν ἄδικον συνήσθη, καὶ οἴκαδε ἐπιθυμοῦντι πάλιν ἀπιέναι πομπὴν ἀσφαλῆ\r\nπαρέσχεν, [C] ἐπιτρέψαι πρῶτον τὸν βασιλέα ξυμπείσασα. δαίμονος δέ, ὅσπερ\r\nοὖν ἐῴκει μοι τὰ πρόσθεν μηχανήσασθαι, ἤ τινος ξυντυχίας ἀλλοκότου τὴν\r\nὁδὸν ταύτην ὑποτεμομένης, ἐποψόμενον πέμπει τὴν Ἑλλάδα, ταύτην αἰτήσασα\r\nπαρὰ βασιλέως ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀποδημοῦντος ἤδη τὴν χάριν, ἐπειδ\\η με λόγοις\r\nἐπέπυστο χαίρειν καὶ παιδείᾳ τὸ χωρίον ἐπιτήδειον εἶναι ξυννοοῦσα. ἐγὼ δὲ\r\nτότε μὲν αὐτῇ καὶ πρώτῳ γε, [D] ὡς εἰκός, βασιλεῖ πολλὰ καὶ ἀγαθὰ διδόναι\r\nτὸν θεὸν ηὐχόμην, ὅτι μοι τὴν ἀληθινὴν ποθοῦντι καὶ ἀγαπῶντι πατρίδα\r\nπαρέσχον ἰδεῖν· ἐσμὲν γὰρ τῆς Ἑλλάδος οἱ περὶ τὴν Θρᾴκην καὶ τὴν Ἰωνίαν\r\nοἰκοῦντες ἔγγονοι, καὶ ὄστις ἡμῶν μὴ λίαν ἀγνώμων, ποθεῖ προσειπεῖν τοὺς\r\nπατέρας καὶ τὴν χώραν αὐτὴν ἀσπάσασθαι. ὃ δὴ καὶ ἐμοὶ πάλαι μὲν ἦν, ὡς\r\nεἰκός, ποθεινόν, [119] καὶ ὑπάρξαι μοι τοῦτο ἐβουλόμην μᾶλλον ἢ πολὺ\r\nχρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον. ἀνδρῶν γὰρ ἀγαθῶν φημι ξυντυχίαν πρὸς χρυσίου πλῆθος\r\nὁσονδηοῦν ἐξεταζομένην καθέλκειν τὸν ζυγὸν καὶ οὐκ ἐπιτρέπειν τῷ σώφρονι\r\nκριτῇ οὐδὲ ἐπ᾽ ὀλίγον ῥοπῆς ἐπιστῆσαι.\r\n\r\n(Why, then, I say that I have been so kindly treated, and in return for\r\nwhat I acknowledge that I am her debtor for all time, that is what you are\r\neager to hear. Nor shall I conceal the facts. The Emperor was kind to me\r\nalmost from my infancy, and he surpassed all generosity, for he snatched\r\nme from dangers so great that not even “a man in the strength of his\r\nyouth”(557) could easily have escaped them, unless he obtained some means\r\nof safety sent by heaven and not attainable by human means, and after my\r\nhouse had been seized by one of those in power, as though there were none\r\nto defend it, he recovered it for me, as was just, and made it wealthy\r\nonce more. And I could tell you of still other kindnesses on his part\r\ntowards myself, that deserve all gratitude, in return for which I ever\r\nshowed myself loyal and faithful to him; but nevertheless of late I\r\nperceived that, I know not why, he was somewhat harsh towards me. Now the\r\nEmpress no sooner heard a bare mention, not of any actual wrong‐doing but\r\nof mere idle suspicion, than she deigned to investigate it, and before\r\ndoing so would not admit or listen to any falsehood or unjust slander, but\r\npersisted in her request until she brought me into the Emperor’s presence\r\nand procured me speech with him. And she rejoiced when I was acquitted of\r\nevery unjust charge, and when I wished to return home, she first persuaded\r\nthe Emperor to give his permission, and then furnished me with a safe\r\nescort. Then when some deity, the one I think who devised my former\r\ntroubles, or perhaps some unfriendly chance, cut short this journey, she\r\nsent me to visit Greece, having asked this favour on my behalf from the\r\nEmperor, when I had already left the country. This was because she had\r\nlearned that I delighted in literature, and she knew that that place is\r\nthe home of culture. Then indeed I prayed first, as is meet, for the\r\nEmperor, and next for Eusebia, that God would grant them many blessings,\r\nbecause when I longed and desired to behold my true fatherland, they made\r\nit possible. For we who dwell in Thrace and Ionia are the sons of Hellas,\r\nand all of us who are not devoid of feeling long to greet our ancestors\r\nand to embrace the very soil of Hellas. So this had long been, as was\r\nnatural, my dearest wish, and I desired it more than to possess treasures\r\nof gold and silver. For I consider that intercourse with distinguished\r\nmen, when weighed in the balance with any amount whatever of gold, drags\r\ndown the beam, and does not permit a prudent judge even to hesitate over a\r\nslight turn of the scale.)\r\n\r\nΠαιδείας δὲ ἕνεκα καὶ φιλοσοφίας πέπονθεν οἶμαι νῦν τὰ τῆς Ἑλλάδος\r\nπαραπλήσιόν τι τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις μυθολογήμασι καὶ λόγοις. λέγουσι γὰρ δὴ [B]\r\nκαὶ Αἰγύπτιοι τὸν Νεῖλον παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς εἶναι τά τ᾽ ἄλλα σωτῆρα καὶ εὐεργέτην\r\nτῆς χώρας καὶ ἀπείργειν αὐτοῖς τὴν ὑπὸ τοῦ πυρὸς φθοράν, ὁπόταν ᾕλιος διὰ\r\nμακρῶν τινων περιόδων ἄστροις γενναίοις συνελθῶν ἢ συγγενόμενος ἐμπλήσῃ\r\nτὸν ἀέρα πυρὸς καὶ ἐπιφλέγῃ τὰ σύμπαντα. οὐ γὰρ ἰσχύει, φασίν, ἀφανίσαι\r\nοὐδὲ ἐξαναλῶσαι τοῦ Νείλου τὰς πηγάς. οὔκουν οὐδὲ ἐξ Ἑλλήνων παντελῶς [C]\r\nοἴχεται φιλοσοφία, οὐδὲ ἐπέλιπε τὰς Ἀθήνας οὐδὲ τὴν Σπάρτην οὐδὲ τὴν\r\nΚόρινθον· ἥκιστα δὲ ἐστι τούτων(558) τῶν πηγῶν ἕκητι τὸ Ἄργος πολυδίψιον·\r\nπολλαὶ μὲν γὰρ ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ ἄστει, πολλαὶ δὲ καὶ πρὸ τοῦ ἄστεος περὶ τὸν\r\nπαλαιον ἐκεῖνον Μάσητα· τὴν Πειρήνην δὲ αὐτὴν ὁ Σικυὼν ἔχει καὶ οὐχ ἡ\r\nΚόρινθος. τῶν Ἀθηνῶν δὲ πολλὰ μὲν καὶ καθαρὰ καὶ ἐπιχώρια τὰ νάματα, πολλὰ\r\nδὲ ἔξωθεν ἐπιρρεῖ καὶ ἐπιφέρεται τίμια τῶν ἔνδον οὐ μεῖον· οἱ δὲ ἀγαπῶσι\r\nκαὶ στέργουσι, [D] πλουτεῖν ἐθέλοντες οὗ μόνου σχεδὸν ὁ πλοῦτος ζηλωτόν.\r\n\r\n(Now, as regards learning and philosophy, the condition of Greece in our\r\nday reminds one somewhat of the tales and traditions of the Egyptians. For\r\nthe Egyptians say that the Nile in their country is not only the saviour\r\nand benefactor of the land, but also wards off destruction by fire, when\r\nthe sun, throughout long periods, in conjunction or combination with fiery\r\nconstellations, fills the atmosphere with heat and scorches everything.\r\nFor it has not power enough, so they say, to evaporate or exhaust the\r\nfountains of the Nile. And so too neither from the Greeks has philosophy\r\naltogether departed, nor has she forsaken Athens or Sparta or Corinth.\r\nAnd, as regards these fountains, Argos can by no means be called\r\n“thirsty,”(559) for there are many in the city itself and many also south\r\nof the city, round about Mases,(560) famous of old. Yet Sicyon, not\r\nCorinth, possesses Peirene itself. And Athens has many such streams, pure\r\nand springing from the soil, and many flow into the city from abroad, but\r\nno less precious than those that are native. And her people love and\r\ncherish them and desire to be rich in that which alone makes wealth\r\nenviable.)\r\n\r\nἩμεῖς δὲ τί ποτε ἄρα πεπόνθαμεν; καὶ τίνα νῦν περαίνειν διανοούμεθα(561)\r\nλόγον, εἰ μὴ τῆς φίλης Ἑλλάδος ἔπαινον, ἧς(562) οὐκ ἔστι μνησθέντα μὴ\r\nπάντα θαυμάζειν; ἀλλ᾽ οὐ φήσει τις τυχὸν ὑπομνησθεὶς τῶν ἔμπροσθεν ταῦτα\r\nἐθέλειν ἡμᾶς ἐξ ἀρχῆς διελθεῖν, καθάπερ δὲ τοὺς Κορυβαντιῶντας ὑπὸ τῶν\r\nαὐλῶν ἐπεγειρομένους χορεύειν καὶ πηδᾶν οὐδενὶ ξὺν λόγῳ, [120] καὶ ἡμᾶς\r\nὑπὸ τῆς μνήμης τῶν παιδικῶν ἀνακινηθέντας ᾆσαι τῆς χώρας καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν\r\nἐγκώμιον. πρὸς δὴ τοῦτον ἀπολογεῖσθαι χρεὼν ὧδέ πως λέγοντα· ὦ δαιμόνιε,\r\nκαὶ τέχνης ἀληθῶς γενναίας ἡγεμών, σοφὸν μὲν χρῆμα ἐπινοεῖς, οὐκ ἐφιεὶς\r\nοὐδὲ ἐπιτρέπων τῶν ἐπαινουμένων οὐδὲ ἐπὶ σμικρὸν μεθίεσθαι, ἅτε αὐτὸς\r\nοἶμαι ξὺν τέχνῃ τοῦτο δρῶν. ἡμῖν δὲ τὸν ἔρωτα τοῦτον, [B] ὃν σὺ φὴς αἴτιον\r\nεἶναι τῆς ἐν τοῖς λόγοις ἀταξίας, ἐπειδὴ προσγέγονεν, οἶμαι,\r\nπαρακελεύεσθαι μὴ σφόδρα ἐκνεῖν μηδὲ εὐλαβεῖσθαι τὰς αἰτίας. οὐ γὰρ\r\nἀλλοτρίων ἁπτόμεθα(563) λόγων δεῖξαι ἐθέλοντες, ὅσων ἡμῖν ἀγαθῶν αἰτία\r\nγέγονε τιμῶσα τὸ φιλοσοφίας ὄνομα. τοῦτο δὲ οὐκ οἶδα ὅντινά μοι τρόπον\r\nἐπικείμενον ἀγαπήσαντι μὲν εὖ μάλα τὸ ἔργον καὶ ἐρασθέντι δεινῶς τοῦ\r\nπράγματος, ἀπολειφθέντι δὲ οὐκ οἶδε ὅντινα τρόπον ὄνομα [C] ἐτύγχανε μόνον\r\nκαὶ λόγος ἔργου στερόμενος. ἡ δὲ ἐτίμα καὶ τοὔνομα· αἰτίαν γὰρ δὴ ἄλλην\r\nοὔτε αὐτὸς εὑρίσκω οὔτε ἄλλου του πυθέσθαι δύναμαι, δι᾽ ἣν οὕτω μοι\r\nπρόθυμος γέγονε βοηθὸς καὶ ἀλεξίκακος καὶ σώτειρα, τὴν τοῦ γενναίου\r\nβασιλέως εὔνοιαν ἀκέραιον ἡμῖν καὶ ἀσινῆ μένειν ξὺν πολλῷ πόνῳ\r\nπραγματευσαμένη, ἧς μεῖζον ἀγαθὸν οὔποτε ἐγώ τι τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων νομίσας\r\nἑάλων, οὐ τὸν ἐπὶ γῆς καὶ ὑπὸ γῆς χρυσὸν ἀντάξιον [D] οὐδ᾽ ἀργύρου πλῆθος,\r\nὁπόσος νῦν ἐστιν ὑπ᾽ αὐγὰς ἡλίου, καὶ εἴ ποτε ἄλλος προσγένοιτο, τῶν\r\nμεγίστων ὀρῶν αὐταῖς, οἶμαι, πέτραις καὶ δένδρεσι μεταβαλλόντων εἰς τήνδε\r\nτὴν φύσιν, οὐδὲ ἀρχὴν τὴν μεγίστην οὐδὲ ἄλλο τῶν πάντων οὐδέν· ἐκ μὲν γὰρ\r\nδὴ ἐκείνης ταῦτά μοι γέγονε πολλὰ καὶ ὅσα οὐδεὶς ἂν ἤλπισεν, οὐ σφόδρα\r\nπολλῶν δεομένῳ γε οὐδὲ ἐμαυτὸν ἐλπίσι τοιαύταις τρέφοντι.\r\n\r\n(But as for me, what has come over me? And what speech do I intend to\r\nachieve if not a panegyric of my beloved Hellas, of which one cannot make\r\nmention without admiring everything? But perhaps someone, remembering what\r\nI said earlier, will say that this is not what I intended to discuss when\r\nI began, and that, just as Corybants when excited by the flute dance and\r\nleap without method, so I, spurred on by the mention of my beloved city,\r\nam chanting the praises of that country and her people. To him I must make\r\nexcuse somewhat as follows: Good sir, you who are the guide to an art that\r\nis genuinely noble, that is a wise notion of yours, for you do not permit\r\nor grant one to let go even for a moment the theme of a panegyric, seeing\r\nthat you yourself maintain your theme with skill. Yet in my case, since\r\nthere has come over me this impulse of affection which you say is to blame\r\nfor the lack of order in my arguments, you really urge me, I think, not to\r\nbe too much afraid of it or to take precautions against criticism. For I\r\nam not embarking on irrelevant themes if I wish to show how great were the\r\nblessings that Eusebia procured for me because she honoured the name of\r\nphilosophy. And yet the name of philosopher which has been, I know not\r\nwhy, applied to myself, is really in my case nothing but a name and lacks\r\nreality, for though I love the reality and am terribly enamoured of the\r\nthing itself, yet for some reason I have fallen short of it. But Eusebia\r\nhonoured even the name. For no other reason can I discover, nor learn from\r\nanyone else, why she became so zealous an ally of mine, and an averter of\r\nevil and my preserver, and took such trouble and pains in order that I\r\nmight retain unaltered and unaffected our noble Emperor’s good‐will; and I\r\nhave never been convicted of thinking that there is any greater blessing\r\nin this world than that good‐will, since all the gold above the earth or\r\nbeneath the earth is not worth so much, nor all the mass of silver that is\r\nnow beneath the sun’s rays or may be added thereto,(564) not though the\r\nloftiest mountains, let us suppose, stones and trees and all were to\r\nchange to that substance, nor the greatest sovereignty there is, nor\r\nanything else in the whole world. And I do indeed owe it to her that these\r\nblessings are mine, so many and greater than anyone could have hoped for,\r\nfor in truth I did not ask for much, nor did I nourish myself with any\r\nsuch hopes.)\r\n\r\nΕὔνοιαν δὲ ἀληθινὴν οὐκ ἔστι πρὸς χρυσίον ἀμείψασθαι, οὐδὲ ἄν τις αὐτὴν\r\nἐντεῦθεν πρίαιτο, [121] θείᾳ δέ τινι καὶ κρείττονι μοίρᾳ ἀνθρώπων ἀγαθῶν\r\nσυμπροθυμουμένων παραγέγνεται.(565) ὃ δὴ καὶ ἐμοὶ παρὰ βασιλέως παιδὶ μὲν\r\nὑπῆρχε κατὰ θεόν, ὀλίγου δὲ οἴχεσθαι δεῆσαν ἀπεσώθη πάλιν τῆς βασιλίδος\r\nἀμυνούσης καὶ ἀπειργούσης τὰς ψευδεῖς καὶ ἀλλοκότους ὑποψίας. ἃς ἐπειδὴ\r\nπαντελῶς ἐκείνη διέλυσεν, ἐναργεῖ τεκμηρίῳ τῷ βίῳ τὠμῷ χρωμένη, καλοῦντός\r\nτε αὖθις [B] τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπὸ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ὑπήκουον, ἆρα ἐνταῦθα κατέλιπεν,\r\nὡς οὐκέτι πολλῆς βοηθείας, ἅτε οὐδενὸς ὄντος ἐν μέσῳ δυσχεροῦς οὐδὲ\r\nὑπόπτου, δεόμενον; καὶ πῶς ἂν ὅσια δρῴην οὕτως ἐναργῆ καὶ σεμνὰ σιωπῶν καὶ\r\nἀποκρύπτων; κυρουμένης τε γὰρ ἐπ᾽ ἐμοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως ταυτησὶ τῆς γνώμης\r\nδιαφερόντως ηὐφραίνετο καὶ συνεπήχει μουσικόν, θαρρεῖν κελεύουσα καὶ μήτε\r\nτὸ μέγεθος δείσαντα τῶν διδομένων ἀρνεῖσθαι τὸ λαβεῖν, [C] μήτε ἀγροίκῳ\r\nκαὶ αὐθάδει(566) χρησάμενον παρῥησίᾳ φαύλως ἀτιμάσαι τοῦ τοσαῦτα\r\nἐργασαμένου ἀγαθὰ τὴν ἀναγκαίαν αἴτησιν. ἐγὼ δὲ ὑπήκουον οὔτι τοῦτό γε\r\nἡδέως σφόδρα ὑπομένων, ἄλλως δὲ ἀπειθεῖν χαλεπὸν ὂν σφόδρα ἠπιστάμην, οἷς\r\nγὰρ ἂν ἐξῇ πράττειν ὅ,τι ἂν ἐθέλωσι σὺν βίᾳ, ἦ που δεόμενοι δυσωπεῖν καὶ\r\nπείθειν ἀρκοῦσιν. οὐκοῦν ἐπειδή μοι πεισθέντι γέγονε [D] καὶ μεταβαλόντι\r\nἐσθῆτα καὶ θεραπείαν καὶ διατριβὰς τὰς συνήθεις καὶ τὴν οἴκησιν δὲ αὐτὴν\r\nκαὶ δίαιταν πάντα ὄγκου πλέα καὶ σεμνότητος ἐκ μικρῶν, ὡς εἰκός, καὶ\r\nφαύλων τῶν πρόσθεν, ἐμοὶ μὲν ὑπὸ ἀηθείας ἡ ψυχὴ διεταράττετο, οὔτι τὸ\r\nμέγεθος ἐκπληττομένῳ τῶν παρόντων ἀγαθῶν· σχεδὸν γὰρ ὑπὸ ἀμαθίας οὐδὲ\r\nμεγάλα ταῦτα ἐνόμιζον, ἀλλὰ δυνάμεις τινὰς χρωμένοις μὲν ὀρθῶς σφόδρα\r\nωφελίμους, ἁμαρτάνουσι δὲ περὶ τὴν χρῆσιν βλαβερὰς [122] καὶ οἴκοις καὶ\r\nπόλεσι πολλαῖς μυρίων αἰτίας ξυμφορῶν. παραπλήσια δὲ ἐπεπονθεῖν ἀνδρὶ\r\nσφόδρα ἀπείρως ἡνιοχικῆς ἔχοντι καὶ οὐδὲ ἐθελήσαντι τύυτης μεταλαβεῖν τῆς\r\nτέχνης, κᾆτα ἀναγκαζομένῳ καλοῦ καὶ γενναίου κομίζειν ἅρμα ἡνιόχου, πολλὰς\r\nμὲν ξυνωρίδας, πολλὰ δέ, οἶμαι, τέτρωρα τρέφοντος καὶ ἅπασι μὲν\r\nἐπιβεβηκότος, διὰ δὲ(567) γενναιότητα φύσεως καὶ ῥώμην ὑπερβάλλουσαν\r\nἔχοντος οἶμαι τὰς ἡνίας πάντων ἐγκρατῶς, [B] εἰ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς μιᾶς ἄντυγος\r\nβαίνοι, οὐ μὴν ἀεί γε ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς μένοντος, μεταφερομένου δὲ πολλάκις\r\nἐνθένδε ἐκεῖσε καὶ ἀμείβοντος δίφρον ἐκ δίφρου, εἴ ποτε τοὺς ἵππους\r\nπονουμένους ἢ καὶ ὑβρίσαντας αἴσθοιτο, ἐν δὲ δὴ τοῖς ἅρμασι τοῖσδε\r\nκεκτημένου τέτρωρον ὑπὸ ἀμαθίας καὶ θράσους ὑβρίζον, πιεζόμενον τῇ συνεχεῖ\r\nταλαιπωρίᾳ καὶ τοῦ θράσους οὐδέν τι μᾶλλον ἐπιλαθόμενον, ἀγριαῖνον δὲ ἀεὶ\r\n[C] καὶ παροξυνόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν συμφορῶν ἐπὶ τὸ μᾶλλον ὑβρίζειν καὶ ἀπειθεῖν\r\nκαὶ ἀντιτείνειν, οὐ δεχόμενον ἀμῶς γέ πη πορεύεσθαι, ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μὴ καὶ αὐτὸν\r\nὁρῴη τὸν ἡνίοχον(568) διὰ τέλους χαλεπαῖνον ἤ, τό γε ἔλαττον, στολὴν γοῦν\r\nἡνιοχικὴν ἄνθρωπον φοροῦντα·(569) οὕτως ἐστὶν ἀλόγιστον φύσει. ὁ δέ,\r\nοἶμαι, παραμυθούμενος αὐτοῦ τὴν ἄνοιαν ἄνδρα ἐπέστησε, δοὺς φορεῖν(570)\r\nτοιαύτην ἐσθῆτα καὶ σχῆμα περιβαλὼν ἡνιόχου σεμνοῦ [D] καὶ ἐπιστήμονος, ὃς\r\nεἰ μὲν ἄφρων εἴη παντελῶς καὶ ἀνόητος, χαίρει καὶ γέγηθε καὶ μετέωρος ὑπὸ\r\nτῶν ἱματίων καθάπερ πτερῶν ἐπαίρεται, συνέσεως δὲ εἰ καὶ ἐπὶ σμικρὸν\r\nμετέχοι καὶ σώφρονος νοῦ, σφόδρα εὐλαβεῖται,\r\n\r\n(But genuine kindness one cannot obtain in exchange for money, nor could\r\nanyone purchase it by such means, but it exists only when men of noble\r\ncharacter work in harmony with a sort of divine and higher providence. And\r\nthis the Emperor bestowed on me even as a child, and when it had almost\r\nvanished it was restored again to me because the Empress defended me and\r\nwarded off those false and monstrous suspicions. And when, using the\r\nevidence of my life as plain proof, she had completely cleared me of them,\r\nand I obeyed once more the Emperor’s summons from Greece, did she ever\r\nforsake me, as though, now that all enmity and suspicion had been removed,\r\nI no longer needed much assistance? Would my conduct be pious if I kept\r\nsilence and concealed actions so manifest and so honourable? For when a\r\ngood opinion of me was established in the Emperor’s mind, she rejoiced\r\nexceedingly, and echoed him harmoniously, bidding me take courage and\r\nneither refuse out of awe to accept the greatness(571) of what was offered\r\nto me, nor, by employing a boorish and arrogant frankness, unworthily\r\nslight the urgent request of him who had shown me such favour. And so I\r\nobeyed, though it was by no means agreeable to me to support this burden,\r\nand besides I knew well that to refuse was altogether impracticable. For\r\nwhen those who have the power to exact by force what they wish condescend\r\nto entreat, naturally they put one out of countenance and there is nothing\r\nleft but to obey. Now when I consented, I had to change my mode of dress,\r\nand my attendants, and my habitual pursuits, and my very house and way of\r\nlife for what seemed full of pomp and ceremony to one whose past had\r\nnaturally been so modest and humble, and my mind was confused by the\r\nstrangeness, though it was certainly not dazzled by the magnitude of the\r\nfavours that were now mine. For in my ignorance I hardly regarded them as\r\ngreat blessings, but rather as powers of the greatest benefit, certainly,\r\nto those who use them aright, but, when mistakes are made in their use, as\r\nbeing harmful to many houses and cities and the cause of countless\r\ndisasters. So I felt like a man who is altogether unskilled in driving a\r\nchariot,(572) and is not at all inclined to acquire the art, and then is\r\ncompelled to manage a car that belongs to a noble and talented charioteer,\r\none who keeps many pairs and many four‐in‐hands too, let us suppose, and\r\nhas mounted behind them all, and because of his natural talent and\r\nuncommon strength has a strong grip on the reins of all of them, even\r\nthough he is mounted on one chariot; yet he does not always remain on it,\r\nbut often moves to this side or that and changes from car to car, whenever\r\nhe perceives that his horses are distressed or are getting out of hand;\r\nand among these chariots he has a team of four that become restive from\r\nignorance and high spirit, and are oppressed by continuous hard work, but\r\nnone the less are mindful of that high spirit, and ever grow more unruly\r\nand are irritated by their distress, so that they grow more restive and\r\ndisobedient and pull against the driver and refuse to go in a certain\r\ndirection, and unless they see the charioteer himself or at least some man\r\nwearing the dress of a charioteer, end by becoming violent, so unreasoning\r\nare they by nature. But when the charioteer encourages some unskilful man,\r\nand sets him over them, and allows him to wear the same dress as his own,\r\nand invests him with the outward seeming of a splendid and skilful\r\ncharioteer, then if he be altogether foolish and witless, he rejoices and\r\nis glad and is buoyed up and exalted by those robes, as though by wings,\r\nbut, if he has even a small share of common sense and prudent\r\nunderstanding, he is very much alarmed)\r\n\r\n\r\n    μήπως αὑτὸν τε τρώσῃ σύν θ᾽ ἅρματα ἄξῃ,\r\n\r\n    (“Lest he both injure himself and shatter his chariot\r\n    withal,”(573))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ τῷ μὲν ἡνιόχῳ ζημίας, αὑτῷ δὲ αἰσχρᾶς καὶ ἀδόξου συμφορᾶς αἴτιος\r\nγένηται. ταῦτα ἐγὼ ἐλογιζόμην ἐν νυκτὶ βουλεύων καὶ δι᾽ ἡμέρας κατ᾽\r\nἐμαυτὸν ἐπισκοπούμενος, [123] σύννους ὢν ἀεὶ καὶ σκυθρωπός. ὁ γενναῖος δὲ\r\nκαὶ θεῖος ἀληθῶς αὐτοκράτωρ ἀφῄρει τι πάντως τῶν ἀλγεινῶν, ἔργοις καὶ\r\nλόγοις τιμῶν καὶ χαριζόμενος. τέλος δὲ τὴν βασιλίδα προσειπεῖν κελεύει,\r\nθάρσος τε ἡμῖν ἐνδιδοὺς καὶ τοῦ σφόδρα πιστεύειν γενναῖον εὖ μάλα παρέχων\r\nγνώρισμα. ἐγὼ δὲ ἐπειδὴ πρῶτον ἐς ὄψιν ἐκείνης ἦλθον, ἐδόκουν μὲν ὥσπερ ἐν\r\nἱερῷ καθιδρυμένον ἄγαλμα σωφροσύνης ὁρᾶν· [B] αἰδὼς δὲ ἐπεῖχε τὴν ψυχήν,\r\nκαὶ ἐπέπηκτό μοι κατὰ γῆς τὰ ὄμματα συχνὸν ἐπιεικῶς χρόνον, ἕως ἐκείνη\r\nθαρρεῖν ἐκέλευε. καὶ τὰ μέν, ἔφη, ἤδη παρ᾽ ἡμῶν ἔχεις, τὰ δὲ καὶ ἕξεις σὺν\r\nθεῷ, μόνον εἰ πιστὸς καὶ δίκαιος εἰς ἡμᾶς γένοιο. τοσαῦτα ἤκουσα σχεδόν·\r\nοὐδὲ γὰρ αὐτὴ πλεῖονα(574) ἐφθέγξατο, καὶ ταῦτα ἐπισταμένη τῶν γενναίων\r\nῥητόρων οὐδὲ ἓν φαυλοτέρους ἀπαγγέλλειν λόγους. ταύτης ἐγὼ τῆς ἐντεύξεως\r\nἀπαλλαγεὶς σφόδρα ἐθαύμασα καὶ ἐξεπεπλήγμην, ἐναργῶς δοκῶν ἀκηκοέναι\r\nσωφροσύνης αὐτῆς φθεγγομένης· οὕτω πρᾷον ἦν αὐτῇ φθέγμα καὶ μείλιχον, [C]\r\nταῖς ἐμαῖς ἀκοαῖς ἐγκαθιδρυμένον.\r\n\r\n(and so cause loss to the charioteer and bring on himself shameful and\r\ninglorious disaster. On all this, then, I reflected, taking counsel with\r\nmyself in the night season, and in the daytime pondering it with myself,\r\nand I was continually thoughtful and gloomy. Then the noble and truly\r\ngodlike Emperor lessened my torment in every way, and showed me honour and\r\nfavour both in deed and word. And at last he bade me address myself to the\r\nEmpress, inspiring me with courage and giving me a very generous\r\nindication that I might trust her completely. Now when first I came into\r\nher presence it seemed to me as though I beheld a statue of Modesty set up\r\nin some temple. Then reverence filled my soul, and my eyes were fixed upon\r\nthe ground(575) for some considerable time, till she bade me take courage.\r\nThen she said: “Certain favours you have already received from us and yet\r\nothers you shall receive, if God will, if only you prove to be loyal and\r\nhonest towards us.” This was almost as much as I heard. For she herself\r\ndid not say more, and that though she knew how to utter speeches not a\r\nwhit inferior to those of the most gifted orators. And I, when I had\r\ndeparted from this interview, felt the deepest admiration and awe, and was\r\nclearly convinced that it was Modesty herself I had heard speaking. So\r\ngentle and comforting was her utterance, and it is ever firmly settled in\r\nmy ears.)\r\n\r\nΒούλεσθε οὖν τὰ μετὰ ταῦτα πάλιν ἔργα καὶ ὅσα ἔδρασεν ἡμᾶς ἀγαθὰ καθ᾽\r\nἕκαστον λεπτουργοῦντες ἀπαγγέλλωμεν; ἢ τά γε ἐντεῦθεν ἀθρόως ἑλόντες,\r\nκαθάπερ ἔδρασεν αὐτὴ,(576) πάντα ὁμοῦ διηγησώμεθα; [D] ὁπόσους μὲν εὖ\r\nἐποίησε τῶν ἐμοὶ γνωρίμων, ὅπως δὲ ἐμοὶ μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως τὸν γάμον\r\nἥρμοσεν. ὑμεῖς δὲ ἴσως ποθεῖτε καὶ τὸν κατάλογον ἀκοίειν τῶν δώρων,\r\n\r\n(Do you wish then that I should report to you what she did after this, and\r\nall the blessings she conferred on me, and that I should give precise\r\ndetails one by one?

But I have no time to gossip about such subjects.\r\nNevertheless one of those gifts of hers it would perhaps not be ungraceful\r\nto mention to you, for it was one with which I was myself especially\r\ndelighted. For she gave me the best books on philosophy and history, and\r\nmany of the orators and poets, since I had brought hardly any with me from\r\nhome, deluding myself with the hope and longing to return home again, and\r\ngave them in such numbers, and all at once, that even my desire for them\r\nwas satisfied, though I am altogether insatiable of converse with\r\nliterature; and, so far as books went, she made Galatia(582) and the\r\ncountry of the Celts resemble a Greek temple of the Muses. And to these\r\ngifts I applied myself incessantly whenever I had leisure, so that I can\r\nnever be unmindful of the gracious giver. Yes, even when I take the field\r\none thing above all else goes with me as a necessary provision for the\r\ncampaign, some one narrative of a campaign composed long ago by an eye‐\r\nwitness. For many of those records of the experience of men of old,\r\nwritten as they are with the greatest skill, furnish to those who, by\r\nreason of their youth, have missed seeing such a spectacle, a clear and\r\nbrilliant picture of those ancient exploits, and by this means many a tiro\r\nhas acquired a more mature understanding and judgment than belongs to very\r\nmany older men; and that advantage which people think old age alone can\r\ngive to mankind, I mean experience (for experience it is that enables an\r\nold man “to talk more wisely than the young”(583)), even this the study of\r\nhistory can give to the young if only they are diligent. Moreover, in my\r\nopinion, there is in such books a means of liberal education for the\r\ncharacter, supposing that one understands how, like a craftsman, setting\r\nbefore himself as patterns the noblest men and words and deeds, to mould\r\nhis own character to match them, and make his words resemble theirs. And\r\nif he should not wholly fall short of them, but should achieve even some\r\nslight resemblance, believe me that would be for him the greatest good\r\nfortune. And it is with this idea constantly before me that not only do I\r\ngive myself a literary education by means of books, but even on my\r\ncampaigns I never fail to carry them like necessary provisions. The number\r\nthat I take with me is limited only by particular circumstances.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ μή ποτε οὐκ ἐκείνων χρὴ νῦν τὸν ἔπαινον γράφειν οὐδὲ ὅσα ἡμῖν ἀγαθὰ\r\nγένοιτ᾽ ἂν ἐνθένδε, [125] ὁπόσου δὲ τὸ δῶρον ἄξιον καταμαθόντας χάριν\r\nἀποτίνειν τυχὸν οὐκ ἀλλοτρίαν τοῦ δοθέντος τῇ χαρισαμένῃ. λόγων γὰρ\r\nἀστείων καὶ παντοδαπῶν θησαυροὺς τὸν ἐν ταῖς βίβλοις δεξάμενον οὐκ ἄδικον\r\nδιὰ σμικρῶν καὶ φαύλων ῥημάτων ἰδιωτικῶς καὶ ἀγροίκως ἄγαν ξυγκειμένων\r\nᾄδειν εὐφημίαν. οὐδὲ γὰρ γεωργὸν φήσεις εὐγνώμονα, ὃς καταφυτεύειν μὲν τὴν\r\nφυταλιὰν ἀρχόμενος κλήματα ᾔτει παρὰ τῶν γειτόνων, εἶτα ἐκτρέφων τὰς\r\nἀμπέλους δίκελλαν καὶ αὖθις σμινύην, καὶ τέλος ἤδη κάλαμον, [B] ᾧ χρὴ\r\nπροσδεδέσθαι καὶ ἐπικεῖσθαι τὴν ἄμπελον, ἵνα αὐτή τε ἀνέχηται καὶ οἱ\r\nβότρυες ἐξηρτημένοι μηδαμοῦ ψαύωσι τῆς βώλου, τυχόντα δὲ ὧν ἐδεῖτο μόνον\r\nἐμπίπλασθαι τοῦ Διονύσου τῆς χάριτος οὔτε τῶν βοτρύων οὔτε τοῦ γλεύκους\r\nμεταδιδόντα τοῖς,(584) ὧν πρὸς τὴν γεωργίαν ἔτυχε προθύμων. οὔκουν οὐδὲ\r\nνομέα ποιμνίων οὐδὲ βουκολίων οὐδὲ μὴν αἰπολίων ἐπιεικῆ καὶ ἀγαθὸν καὶ\r\nεὐγνώμονα φήσει τις, ὃς τοῦ μὲν χειμώνος, ὅτε αὐτῷ στέγης καὶ πόας ἐδεῖτο\r\nτὰ βοσκήματα, [C] σφόδρα ἐτύγχανε προθύμων τῶν φίλων, πολλὰ μὲν αὐτῷ\r\nξυμποριζόντων καὶ μεταδιδόντων τροφῆς ἀφθόνου καὶ καταγωγίων, ἦρος δὲ\r\nοἶμαι καὶ θέρους φανέντος μάλα γενναίως ἐπιλαθόμενον ὧν εὖ πάθοι, οὔτε τοῦ\r\nγάλακτος οὔτε τῶν τυρῶν οὔτε ἄλλου τοῦ μεταδιδόντα τοῖς(585) ὑφ᾽ ὧν αὐτῷ\r\nδιεσώθη ἀπολόμενα ἂν ἄλλως τὰ θρέμματα.\r\n\r\n(But perhaps I ought not now to be writing a panegyric on books, nor to\r\ndescribe all the benefits that we might derive from them, but since I\r\nrecognise how much that gift was worth, I ought to pay back to the\r\ngracious giver thanks not perhaps altogether different in kind from what\r\nshe gave. For it is only just that one who has accepted clever discourses\r\nof all sorts laid up as treasure in books, should sound a strain of eulogy\r\nif only in slight and unskilful phrases, composed in an unlearned and\r\nrustic fashion. For you would not say that a farmer showed proper feeling\r\nwho, when starting to plant his vineyard, begs for cuttings from his\r\nneighbours, and presently, when he cultivates his vines, asks for a\r\nmattock and then for a hoe, and finally for a stake to which the vine must\r\nbe tied and which it must lean against, so that it may itself be\r\nsupported, and the bunches of grapes as they hang may nowhere touch the\r\nsoil; and then, after obtaining all he asked for, drinks his fill of the\r\npleasant gift of Dionysus, but does not share either the grapes or the\r\nmust with those whom he found so willing to help him in his husbandry.\r\nJust so one would not say that a shepherd or neatherd or even a goatherd\r\nwas honest and good and right‐minded, who in winter, when his flocks need\r\nshelter and fodder, met with the utmost consideration from his friends,\r\nwho helped him to procure many things, and gave him food in abundance, and\r\nlodging, and presently when spring and summer appeared, forgot in lordly\r\nfashion all those kindnesses, and shared neither his milk nor cheeses nor\r\nanything else with those who had saved his beasts for him when they would\r\notherwise have perished.)\r\n\r\nὍστις οὖν λόγους ὁποιουσοῦν τρέφων νέος μὲν αὐτὸς καὶ ἡγεμόνων πολλῶν\r\nδεόμενος, τροφῆς δὲ πολλῆς [D] καὶ καθαρᾶς τῆς ἐκ τῶν παλαιῶν γραμμάτων,\r\nεἶτα ἀθρόως πάντων στερηθείη(586) ἆρα ὑμῖν μικρᾶς δεῖσθαι βοηθείας δοκεῖ ἢ\r\nμικρῶν αὐτῷ γεγονέναι ἄξιος ὁ πρὸς ταῦτα συλλαμβανόμενος; καὶ τυχὸν οὐ χρὴ\r\nπειρᾶσθαι χάριν ἀποτίνειν αὐτῷ τῆς προθυμίας καὶ τῶν ἔργων; ἀλλὰ μή ποτε\r\nτὸν Θαλῆν ἐκεῖνον, τῶν σοφῶν τὸ κεφάλαιον μιμητέον,(587) οὗ τὰ ἐπαινούμενα\r\nἀκηκόαμεν; ἐρομένου γάρ τινος ὑπὲρ ὧν ἔμαθεν [126] ὁπόσον τινὰ χρὴ\r\nκαταβαλεῖν μισθόν· ὁμολογῶν, ἔφη, τι(588) παρ᾽ ἡμῶν μαθεῖν τὴν ἀξίαν ἡμῖν\r\nἐκτίσεις. οὐκοῦν καὶ ὅστις διδάσκαλος μὲν αὐτὸς οὐ γέγονε, πρὸς τὸ μαθεῖν\r\nδὲ καὶ ὁτιοῦν συνηνύγκατο, ἀδικοῖτ᾽ ἄν, εἰ μὴ τυγχάνοι τῆς χάριτος καὶ τῆς\r\nἐπὶ τοῖς δοθεῖσιν ὁμολογίας, ἣν δὴ καὶ ὁ σοφὸς ἀπαιτῶν φαίνεται. εἶεν.\r\nἀλλὰ τοῦτο μὲν χαρίεν καὶ σεμνὸν τὸ δῶρον· χρυσίον δὲ καὶ ἀργύριον οὔτε\r\nἐδεόμην ἐγὼ λαβεῖν οὔτε ὑμᾶς δὴ [B] ὑπὲρ τούτων ἡδέως ἂν ἐνοχλήσαιμι.\r\n\r\n(And now take the case of one who cultivates literature of any sort, and\r\nis himself young and therefore needs numerous guides and the abundant food\r\nand pure nourishment that is to be obtained from ancient writings, and\r\nthen suppose that he should be deprived of all these all at once, is it,\r\nthink you, slight assistance that he is asking? And is it slight payment\r\nthat he deserves who comes to his aid? But perhaps he ought not even to\r\nattempt to make him any return for his zeal and kind actions? Perhaps he\r\nought to imitate the famous Thales, that consummate philosopher, and that\r\nanswer which we have all heard and which is so much admired? For when\r\nsomeone asked what fee he ought to pay him for knowledge he had acquired,\r\nThales replied “If you let it be known that it was I who taught you, you\r\nwill amply repay me.” Just so one who has not himself been the teacher,\r\nbut has helped another in any way to gain knowledge, would indeed be\r\nwronged if he did not obtain gratitude and that acknowledgement of the\r\ngift which even the philosopher seems to have demanded. Well and good. But\r\nthis gift of hers was both welcome and magnificent. And as for gold and\r\nsilver I neither asked for them nor, were they in question, should I be\r\nwilling thus to wear out your patience.)\r\n\r\nΛόγον δὲ ὑμῖν εἰπεῖν ἐθέλω μάλα δή τι(589) ὑμῖν ἀκοῆς ἄξιον, εἰ μὴ\r\nτυγχάνομεν ἀπειρηκότες πρὸς τὸ μῆκος τῆς ἀδολεσχίας· τυχὸν δὲ(590) οὐδὲ\r\nτῶν ῥηθέντων ἠκρόασθε ξὺν ἡδονῇ ἅτε ἀνδρὸς ἰδιώτου καὶ σφόδρα ἀμαθοῦς\r\nλόγων, πλάττειν μὲν οὐδὲν οὐδὲ τεχνάζειν εἰδότος, φράζοντος δὲ ὅπως ἂν\r\nἐπίῃ τάληθές· ὁ δὲ δὴ λόγος σχεδόν τι περὶ τῶν παρόντων ἐστί. φήσουσι γάρ,\r\n[C] οἶμαι, πολλοὶ παρὰ τῶν μακαρίων σοφιστῶν ἀναπειθόμενοι, ὅτι ἄρα μικρὰ\r\nκαὶ φαῦλα πράγματα ἀναλεξάμενος ὡς δή τι σεμνὸν ὑμῖν ἀπαγγέλλω. τοῦτο δὲ\r\nοὐ φιλονεικοῦντες πρὸς τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους οὐδὲ ἐμὲ τῆς ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς\r\nἀφαιρεῖσθαι δόξης ἐθέλοντες ἴσως ἂν εἴποιεν· ἴσασι γὰρ σαφῶς, ὅτι μήτε\r\nἀντίτεχνος εἶναι βούλομαι τοῖς ἐκείνων λόγοις τοὺς ἐμαυτοῦ παρατιθείς,\r\nμήτε ἄλλως ἀπεχθάνεσθαι ἐκείνοις ἐθέλω· ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ οἶδα ὅντινα τρόπον [D]\r\nτοῦ μεγάλα λέγειν ἐκ παντὸς ὀρεγόμενοι χαλεπῶς ἔχουσι πρὸς τοὺς μὴ\r\nτἀκείνων ζηλοῦντας καὶ δι᾽ αἰτίας ἄγουσιν ὡς καθαιροῦντας τὴν τῶν λόγων\r\nἰσχύν. μόνα γὰρ εἶναι τῶν ἔργων ζηλωτά φασι καὶ σπουδῆς ἄξια καὶ πολλῶν\r\nἐπαίνων ὁπόσα διὰ μέγεθος ἤδη τισὶν ἄπιστα ἐφάνη, ὁποῖα δή τινα τὰ περὶ\r\nτῆς Ἀσσυρίας ἐκείνης γυναικός, ἣ μεταβαλοῦσα καθάπερ ῥεῖθρον εὐτελὲς τὸν\r\nδιὰ τῆς Βαβυλῶνος ποταμὸν ῥέοντα βασίλειά [127] τε ᾠκοδόμησεν ὑπὸ γῆς\r\nπάγκαλα καὶ μεθῆκεν ὑπὲρ τῶν χωμάτων αὖθις. ὑπὲρ γὰρ δὴ ταύτης πολὺς μὲν\r\nλόγος, ὡς ἐναυμάχει ναυσὶ τρισχιλίαις, καὶ πεζῇ παρετάττετο μυριάδας\r\nὁπλιτῶν τριακοσίας ἄγουσα, τό τε ἐν Βαβυλῶνι τεῖχος ᾠκοδόμει πεντακοσίων\r\nσταδίων μικρὸν ἀποδέον, καὶ τὰ περὶ τὴν πόλιν ὀρύγματα καὶ ἄλλα πολυτελῆ\r\nκαὶ δαπανηρὰ κατασκευάσματα ἐκείνης ἔργα γενέσθαι [B] λέγουσι.

And my story is about\r\nsomething almost of the present time. Now many will say, I suppose,\r\npersuaded by the accomplished sophists, that I have collected what is\r\ntrivial and worthless, and relate it to you as though it were of serious\r\nimport. And probably they will say this, not because they are jealous of\r\nmy speeches, or because they wish to rob me of the reputation that they\r\nmay bring. For they well know that I do not desire to be their rival in\r\nthe art by setting my own speeches against theirs, nor in any other way do\r\nI wish to quarrel with them. But since, for some reason or other, they are\r\nambitious of speaking on lofty themes at any cost, they will not tolerate\r\nthose who have not their ambition, and they reproach them with weakening\r\nthe power of rhetoric. For they say that only those deeds are to be\r\nadmired and are worthy of serious treatment and repeated praise which,\r\nbecause of their magnitude, have been thought by some to be incredible,\r\nthose stories for instance about that famous woman(592) of Assyria who\r\nturned aside as though it were an insignificant brook the river(593) that\r\nflows through Babylon, and built a gorgeous palace underground, and then\r\nturned the stream back again beyond the dykes that she had made. For of\r\nher many a tale is told, how she fought a naval battle with three thousand\r\nships, and on land she led into the field of battle three million\r\nhoplites, and in Babylon she built a wall very nearly five hundred stades\r\nin length, and the moat that surrounds the city and other very costly and\r\nexpensive edifices were, they tell us, her work. And Nitocris(594) who\r\ncame later than she, and Rhodogyne(595) and Tomyris,(596) aye and a crowd\r\nof women beyond number who played men’s parts in no very seemly fashion\r\noccur to my mind. And some of them were conspicuous for their beauty and\r\nso became notorious, though it brought them no happiness, but since they\r\nwere the causes of dissension and long wars among countless nations and as\r\nmany men as could reasonably be collected from a country of that size,\r\nthey are celebrated by the orators as having given rise to mighty deeds.\r\nAnd a speaker who has nothing of this sort to relate seems ridiculous\r\nbecause he makes no great effort to astonish his hearers or to introduce\r\nthe marvellous into his speeches. Now shall we put this question to these\r\norators, whether any one of them would wish to have a wife or daughter of\r\nthat sort, rather than like Penelope? And yet in her case Homer had no\r\nmore to tell than of her discretion and her love for her husband and the\r\ngood care she took of her father‐in‐law and her son. Evidently she did not\r\nconcern herself with the fields or the flocks, and as for leading an army\r\nor speaking in public, of course she never even dreamed of such a thing.\r\nBut even when it was necessary for her to speak to the young suitors,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα\r\n\r\n    (“Holding up before her face her shining veil”(597))\r\n\r\n\r\nπρᾴως ἐφθέγγετο. καὶ οὐκ ἀπορῶν Ὅμηρος οἶμαι τηλικούτων ἔργων οὐδὲ\r\nὀνομαστῶν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς γυναικῶν ταύτην ὕμνησε διαφερόντως· ἐξῆν γοῦν αὐτῷ\r\nτὴν τῆς Ἀμαζόνος φιλοτίμως πάνυ στρατείαν διηγησαμένῳ τὴν ποίησιν ἅπασαν\r\nἐμπλῆσαι τοιούτων διηγημάτων τέρπειν εὖ μάλα καὶ ψυχαγωγεῖν δυναμένων.\r\n[128] οὐ γὰρ δὴ τείχους μὲν αἵρεσιν, καὶ πολιορκίαν καὶ τρόπον τινὰ\r\nναυμαχίαν εἶναι δοκοῦσαν, τὸν πρὸς τοῖς νεωρίοις πόλεμον, ἀνδρός τε ἐπ᾽\r\nαὐτῇ καὶ ποταμοῦ μάχην ἐπεισάγειν οἴκοθεν διενοεῖτο τῇ ποιήσει καινόν τι\r\nλέγειν ἐπιθυμῶν· τοῦτο δὲ εἴπερ ἦν, ὥσπερ οὖν φασι, σεμνότατον, ὀλιγώρως\r\nοὕτω παρέλιπε. τί ποτε οὖν ἄν τις αἴτιον λέγοι τοῦ κείνην μὲν ἐπαινεῖν\r\nπροθύμως, τούτων δ᾽ οὐδ᾽(598) ἐπὶ σμικρὸν μνημονεύειν; ὅτι [B] διὰ μὲν τὴν\r\nἐκείνης ἀρετὴν καὶ σωφροσύνην πολλὰ ἴδίᾳ τε(599) τοῖς ἀνθρώποις καὶ εἰς τὸ\r\nκοινὸν ἀγαθὰ συμβαίνει, ἐκ δὲ δὴ τῆς τούτων φιλοτιμίας ὄφελος μὲν οὐδὲ ἕν,\r\nσυμφοραὶ δὲ ἀνήκεστοι. ἅτε δὴ ὢν οἶμαι σοφὸς καὶ θεῖος ποιητὴς ταύτην\r\nἔκρινεν ἀμείνω καὶ δικαιοτέραν τὴν εὐφημίαν. ἆρ᾽ οὖν ἔτι προσῆκον(600)\r\nεὐλαβηθῆναι τοσοῦτον ἡγεμόνα ποιουμένοις, μή τις ἄρα μικροὺς ὑπολάβῃ καὶ\r\nφαύλους;\r\n\r\n(it was in mild accents that she expressed herself. And it was not because\r\nhe was short of such great deeds, or of women famous for them, that he\r\nsang the praises of Penelope rather than the others. For instance, he\r\ncould have made it his ambition to tell the story of the Amazon’s(601)\r\ncampaign and have filled all his poetry with tales of that sort, which\r\ncertainly have a wonderful power to delight and charm. For as to the\r\ntaking of the wall and the siege, and that battle near the ships which in\r\nsome respects seems to have resembled a sea‐fight, and then the fight of\r\nthe hero and the river,(602) he did not bring them into this poem with the\r\ndesire to relate something new and strange of his own invention. And even\r\nthough this fight was, as they say, most marvellous, he neglected and\r\npassed over the marvellous as we see. What reason then can anyone give for\r\nhis praising Penelope so enthusiastically and making not the slightest\r\nallusion to those famous women? Because by reason of her virtue and\r\ndiscretion many blessings have been gained for mankind, both for\r\nindividuals and for the common weal, whereas from the ambition of those\r\nothers there has arisen no benefit whatever, but incurable calamities. And\r\nso, as he was, I think, a wise and inspired poet, he decided that to\r\npraise Penelope was better and more just. And since I adopt so great a\r\nguide, is it fitting that I should be afraid lest some person think me\r\ntrivial or inferior?)\r\n\r\n[C] Ἐγὼ δὲ ὑμῖν καὶ τὸν γενναῖον ἐκεῖνον ῥήτορα Περικλέα τὸν πάνυ, τὸν\r\nὈλύμπιον, μάρτυρα ἀγαθὸν ἤδη παρέξομαι. κολάκων γὰρ δή, φασὶ, ποτὲ τὸν\r\nἄνδρα περιεστὼς δῆμος διελάγχανον τοὺς ἐπαίνους, ὁ μὲν ὅτι τὴν Σάμον\r\nἐξεῖλεν, ἄλλος δὲ ὅτι τὴν Εὔβοιαν, τινὲς δὲ ἤδη τὸ περιπλεῦσαι τὴν\r\nΠελοπόννησον, ἦσαν δὲ οἱ τῶν ψηφισμάτων μεμνημένοι, τινὲς δὲ τῆς πρὸς τὸν\r\nΚίμωνα φιλοτιμίας, σφόδρα ἀγαθὸν πολίτην καὶ στρατηγὸν εἶναι δόξαντα\r\nγενναῖον.

It is said(604) that\r\nonce a crowd of flatterers surrounded him and were distributing his\r\npraises among them, one telling how he had reduced Samos,(605) another how\r\nhe had recovered Euboea,(606) some how he had sailed round the\r\nPeloponnesus, while others spoke of his enactments, or of his rivalry with\r\nCimon, who was reputed to be a most excellent citizen and a distinguished\r\ngeneral. But Pericles gave no sign either of annoyance or exultation, and\r\nthere was but one thing in all his political career for which he claimed\r\nto deserve praise, that, though he had governed the Athenian people for so\r\nlong, he had been responsible for no man’s death, and no citizen when he\r\nput on black clothes had ever said that Pericles was the cause of his\r\nmisfortune. Now, by Zeus the god of friendship, do you think I need any\r\nfurther witness to testify that the greatest proof of virtue and one\r\nbetter worth praise than all the rest put together is not to have caused\r\nthe death of any citizen, or to have taken his money from him, or involved\r\nhim in unjust exile? But he who like a good physician tries to ward off\r\nsuch calamities as these, and by no means thinks that it is enough for him\r\nnot to cause anyone to contract a disease, but unless he cures and cares\r\nfor everyone as far as he can, considers that his work is unworthy of his\r\nskill, do you think that in justice such a one ought to receive no higher\r\npraise than Pericles?

I could\r\nindeed very properly have given an account of this visit, and described\r\nhow the people and the senate welcomed her with rejoicings and went to\r\nmeet her with enthusiasm, and received her as is their custom to receive\r\nan Empress, and told the amount of the expenditure, how generous and\r\nsplendid it was, and the costliness of the preparations, and reckoned up\r\nthe sums she distributed to the presidents of the tribes and the\r\ncenturions of the people.

Julian’s Fourth Oration is,\r\naccording to the definition of the rhetorician Menander, a φυσικὸς ὕμνος,\r\na hymn that describes the physical qualities of a god. Julian was an\r\nuncritical disciple of the later Neo‐Platonic school, and apparently\r\nreproduces without any important modification the doctrines of its chief\r\nrepresentative, the Syrian Iamblichus, with whom begins the decadence of\r\nNeo‐Platonism as a philosophy. Oriental superstition took the place of the\r\nsevere spiritualism of Plotinus and his followers, and a philosophy that\r\nhad been from the first markedly religious, is now expounded by theurgists\r\nand the devotees of strange Oriental cults. It is Mithras the Persian sun‐\r\ngod, rather than Apollo, whom Julian identifies with his “intellectual\r\ngod” Helios, and Apollo plays a minor part among his manifestations.\r\nMithras worship, which Tertullian called “a Satanic plagiarism of\r\nChristianity,” because in certain of its rites it recalled the sacraments\r\nof the Christian church, first made its appearance among the Romans in the\r\nfirst century B.C.(609) Less hospitably received at first than the cults\r\nof Isis and Serapis and the Great Mother of Pessinus, it gradually\r\noverpowered them and finally dominated the whole Roman Empire, though it\r\nwas never welcomed by the Hellenes. For the Romans it supplied the ideals\r\nof purity, devotion and self‐control which the other cults had lacked. The\r\nworshippers of Mithras were taught to contend against the powers of evil,\r\nsubmitted themselves to a severe moral discipline, and their reward after\r\ndeath was to become as pure as the gods to whom they ascend. “If\r\nChristianity,” says Renan, “had been checked in its growth by some deadly\r\ndisease, the world would have become Mithraic.” Julian, like the Emperor\r\nCommodus in the second century, had no doubt been initiated into the\r\nMysteries of Mithras, and the severe discipline of the cult was profoundly\r\nattractive to one who had been estranged by early associations from the\r\nvery similar teaching of the Christians.\r\n\r\nJulian followed Plotinus and Iamblichus in making the supreme principle\r\nthe One (ἓν) or the Good (τὸ ἀγαθὸν) which presides over the intelligible\r\nworld (νοητὸς κόσμος), where rule Plato’s Ideas, now called the\r\nintelligible gods (νοητοὶ θεοί). Iamblichus had imported into the Neo‐\r\nPlatonic system the intermediary world of intellectual gods (νοεροὶ θεοί).\r\nOn them Helios‐Mithras, their supreme god and centre, bestows the\r\nintelligence and creative and unifying forces that he has received from\r\nhis transcendental counterpart among the intelligible gods. The third\r\nmember of the triad is the world of sense‐perception governed by the sun,\r\nthe visible counterpart of Helios. What distinguishes Julian’s triad(610)\r\nfrom other Neo‐Platonic triads is this hierarchy of three suns in the\r\nthree worlds: and further, the importance that he gives to the\r\nintermediary world, the abode of Helios‐Mithras. He pays little attention\r\nto the remote intelligible world and devotes his exposition to Helios, the\r\nintellectual god, and the visible sun. Helios is the link that relates the\r\nthree members of the triad. His “middleness” (μεσότης) is not only local:\r\nhe is in every possible sense the mediator and unifier. μεσότης is the\r\nAristotelian word for the “mean,” but there is no evidence that it was\r\nused with the active sense of mediation before Julian. A passage in\r\nPlutarch however seems to indicate that the “middleness” of the sun was a\r\nPersian doctrine: “The principle of good most nearly resembles light, and\r\nthe principle of evil darkness, and between both is Mithras; therefore the\r\nPersians called Mithras the Mediator” (μεσίτης).(611) Naville has pointed\r\nout the resemblance between the sun as mediator and the Christian Logos,\r\nwhich Julian may have had in mind. Julian’s system results in a\r\npractically monotheistic worship of Helios, and here he probably parts\r\ncompany with Iamblichus.\r\n\r\nBut though deeply influenced by Mithraism, Julian was attempting to revive\r\nthe pagan gods, and if he could not, in the fourth century, restore the\r\nancient faith in the gods of Homer he nevertheless could not omit from his\r\ncreed the numerous deities whose temples and altars he had rebuilt. Here\r\nhe took advantage of the identification of Greek, Roman, and Oriental\r\ndeities which had been going on for centuries. The old names, endeared by\r\nthe associations of literature, could be retained without endangering the\r\nsupremacy of Helios. Julian identifies Zeus, Helios, Hades, Oceanus and\r\nthe Egyptian Serapis. But the omnipotent Zeus of Greek mythology is now a\r\ncreative force which works with Helios and has no separate existence.\r\nTradition had made Athene the child of Zeus, but Julian regards her as the\r\nmanifestation of the intelligent forethought of Helios. Dionysus is the\r\nvehicle of his fairest thoughts, and Aphrodite a principle that emanates\r\nfrom him. He contrives that all the more important gods of Greece, Egypt\r\nand Persia shall play their parts as manifestations of Helios. The lesser\r\ngods are mediating demons as well as forces. His aim was to provide the\r\nHellenic counterpart of the positive revealed religion of Christianity.\r\nHence his insistence on the inspiration of Homer, Hesiod, and Plato, and\r\nhis statement(612) that the allegorical interpretations of the mysteries\r\nare not mere hypotheses, whereas the doctrines of the astronomers deserve\r\nno higher title.\r\n\r\nThe Oration is dedicated to his friend and comrade in arms Sallust who is\r\nprobably identical with the Neo‐Platonic philosopher, of the school of\r\nIamblichus, who wrote about 360 the treatise _On the Gods and the World_.\r\nCumont calls this “the official catechism of the Pagan empire,” and\r\nWilamowitz regards it as the positive complement of Julian’s pamphlet\r\n_Against the Christians_. Julian’s Eighth Oration is a discourse of\r\nconsolation, παραμυθητικὸς, for the departure of Sallust when Constantius\r\nrecalled him from Gaul in 358.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Caesar)\r\n\r\nΕΙΣ ΤΟΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΑ ΗΛΙΟΝ ΠΡΟΣ ΣΑΛΟΥΣΤΙΟΝ\r\n\r\n(Hymn To King Helios.

For I am a follower of\r\nKing Helios. And of this fact I possess within me, known to myself alone,\r\nproofs more certain that I can give.(621) But this at least I am permitted\r\nto say without sacrilege, that from my childhood an extraordinary longing\r\nfor the rays of the god penetrated deep into my soul; and from my earliest\r\nyears my mind was so completely swayed by the light that illumines the\r\nheavens that not only did I desire to gaze intently at the sun, but\r\nwhenever I walked abroad in the night season, when the firmament was clear\r\nand cloudless, I abandoned all else without exception and gave myself up\r\nto the beauties of the heavens; nor did I understand what anyone might say\r\nto me, nor heed what I was doing myself. I was considered to be over‐\r\ncurious about these matters and to pay too much attention to them, and\r\npeople went so far as to regard me as an astrologer when my beard had only\r\njust begun to grow. And yet, I call heaven to witness, never had a book on\r\nthis subject come into my hands; nor did I as yet even know what that\r\nscience was. But why do I mention this, when I have more important things\r\nto tell, if I should relate how, in those days, I thought about the gods?\r\nHowever let that darkness(622) be buried in oblivion. But let what I have\r\nsaid bear witness to this fact, that the heavenly light shone all about\r\nme, and that it roused and urged me on to its contemplation, so that even\r\nthen I recognised of myself that the movement of the moon was in the\r\nopposite direction to the universe, though as yet I had met no one of\r\nthose who are wise in these matters. Now for my part I envy the good\r\nfortune of any man to whom the god has granted to inherit a body built of\r\nthe seed of holy and inspired ancestors, so that he can unlock the\r\ntreasures of wisdom; nor do I despise that lot with which I was myself\r\nendowed by the god Helios, that I should be born of a house that rules and\r\ngoverns the world in my time; but further, I regard this god, if we may\r\nbelieve the wise, as the common father of all mankind.(623) For it is said\r\nwith truth that man and the sun together beget man, and that the god sows\r\nthis earth with souls which proceed not from himself alone but from the\r\nother gods also; and for what purpose, the souls reveal by the kind of\r\nlives that they select. Now far the best thing is when anyone has the\r\nfortune to have inherited the service of the god, even before the third\r\ngeneration, from a long and unbroken line of ancestors; yet it is not a\r\nthing to be disparaged when anyone, recognising that he is by nature\r\nintended to be the servant of Helios, either alone of all men, or in\r\ncompany with but few, devotes himself to the service of his master.)\r\n\r\nΦέρε οὖν, ὅπως ἂν οἷοί τε ὦμεν, ὑμνήσωμεν αὐτοῦ τὴν ἑορτήν, ἣν ἡ\r\nβασιλεύουσα πόλις ἐπετησίοις ἀγάλλει θυσίαις. ἔστι μὲν οὖν, εὖ οἶδα,\r\nχαλεπὸν καὶ τὸ ξυνεῖναι περὶ αὐτοῦ μόνον, ὁπόσος τίς ἐστιν ὁ ἀφανὴς [132]\r\nἐκ τοῦ φανεροῦ λογισαμένῳ, φράσαι δὲ ἴσως ἀδύνατον, εἰ καὶ τῆς ἀξίας\r\nἔλαττον ἐθελήσειέ τις. ἐφικέσθαι μὲν γὰρ τοῦ πρὸς ἀξίαν εὖ οἶδα ὅτι τῶν\r\nἁπάντων οὐδεὶς ἂν δύναιτο, τοῦ μετρίου δὲ μὴ διαμαρτεῖν ἐν τοῖς ἐπαίνοις\r\nτὸ κεφάλαιόν ἐστι τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης ἐν τῷ δύνασθαι φράζειν δυνάμεως. ἀλλ᾽\r\nἔμοιγε τούτου παρασταίη βοηθὸς ὅ τε λόγιος(624) Ἑρμῆς ξὺν ταῖς Μούσαις ὅ\r\nτε Μουσηγέτης Ἀπόλλων,(625) [B] ἐπεὶ καὶ αὐτῷ προσήκει τῶν λόγων, καὶ\r\nδοῖεν δὲ εἰπεῖν ὁπόσα τοῖς θεοῖς φίλα λέγεσθαί τε καὶ πιστεύεσθαι περὶ\r\nαὐτῶν. τίς οὖν ὁ τρόπος ἔσται τῶν ἐπαίνων; ἢ δῆλον ὅτι περὶ τῆς οὐσίας\r\nαὐτοῦ καὶ ὅθεν προῆλθε καὶ τῶν δυνάμεων καὶ τῶν ἐνεργειῶν διελθόντες,\r\nὁπόσαι φανεραὶ ὅσαι τ᾽ ἀφανεῖς, καὶ περὶ τῆς τῶν ἀγαθῶν δόσεως, ἣν κατὰ\r\nπάντας ποιεῖται τοὺς κόσμους, οὐ παντάπασιν ἀπᾴδοντα ποιησόμεθα τῷ θεῷ τὰ\r\nἐγκώμια; [C] ἀρκτέον δὲ ἐνθένδε.\r\n\r\n(Come then, let me celebrate, as best I may, his festival which the\r\nImperial city(626) adorns with annual sacrifices.(627) Now it is hard, as\r\nI well know, merely to comprehend how great is the Invisible, if one judge\r\nby his visible self,(628) and to tell it is perhaps impossible, even\r\nthough one should consent to fall short of what is his due. For well I\r\nknow that no one in the world could attain to a description that would be\r\nworthy of him, and not to fail of a certain measure of success in his\r\npraises is the greatest height to which human beings can attain in the\r\npower of utterance.

He,\r\ntherefore, whether it is right to call him the Supra‐Intelligible, or the\r\nIdea of Being, and by Being I mean the whole intelligible region, or the\r\nOne, since the One seems somehow to be prior to all the rest, or, to use\r\nPlato’s name for him, the Good; at any rate this uncompounded cause of the\r\nwhole reveals to all existence beauty, and perfection, and oneness, and\r\nirresistible power; and in virtue of the primal creative substance that\r\nabides in it, produced, as middle among the middle and intellectual,\r\ncreative causes, Helios the most mighty god, proceeding from itself and in\r\nall things like unto itself. Even so the divine Plato believed, when he\r\nwrites, “Therefore (said I) when I spoke of this, understand that I meant\r\nthe offspring of the Good which the Good begat in his own likeness, and\r\nthat what the Good is in relation to pure reason and its objects in the\r\nintelligible world, such is the sun in the visible world in relation to\r\nsight and its objects.” Accordingly his light has the same relation to the\r\nvisible world as truth has to the intelligible world. And he himself as a\r\nwhole, since he is the son of what is first and greatest, namely, the Idea\r\nof the Good, and subsists from eternity in the region of its abiding\r\nsubstance, has received also the dominion among the intellectual gods, and\r\nhimself dispenses to the intellectual gods those things of which the Good\r\nis the cause for the intelligible gods. Now the Good is, I suppose, the\r\ncause for the intelligible gods of beauty, existence, perfection, and\r\noneness, connecting these and illuminating them with a power that works\r\nfor good. These accordingly Helios bestows on the intellectual gods also,\r\nsince he has been appointed by the Good to rule and govern them, even\r\nthough they came forth and came into being together with him, and this\r\nwas, I suppose, in order that the cause which resembles the Good may guide\r\nthe intellectual gods to blessings for them all, and may regulate all\r\nthings according to pure reason.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ καὶ τρίτος ὁ φαινόμενος οὑτοσί δίσκος ἐναργῶς αἴτιός ἐστι τοῖς\r\nαἰσθητοῖς τῆς σωτηρίας, καὶ ὅσων ἔφαμεν τοῖς νοεροῖς θεοῖς τὸν μέγαν\r\nἭλιον, τοσούτων αἴτιος(635) καὶ ὁ φαινόμενος ὅδε τοῖς φανεροῖς. τούτων δ᾽\r\nἐναργεῖς αἱ πίστεις ἐκ τῶν φαινομένων [D] τὰ ἀφανῆ σκοποῦντι.(636) φέρε δὴ\r\nπρῶτον αὐτὸ τὸ φῶς οὐκ εἶδός ἐστιν ἀσώματόν τι θεῖον τοῦ κατ᾽ ἐνέργειαν\r\nδιαφανοῦς; αὐτὸ δὲ ὅ, τί ποτέ ἐστι τὸ διαφανές, πᾶσι μὲν ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν\r\nσυνυποκείμενον τοῖς στοιχείοις καὶ ὂν αὐτῶν προσεχὲς εἶδος, οὐ σωματοειδὲς\r\nοὐδὲ συμμιγνύμενον οὐδὲ τὰς οἰκείας σώματι προσιέμενον ποιότητας. οὔκουν\r\nἰδίαν αὐτοῦ θέρμην ἐρεῖς,(637) οὐ τὴν ἐναντίαν αὐτῇ ψυχρότητα, οὐ τὸ\r\nσκληρόν, οὐ τὸ μαλακὸν ἀποδώσεις, [134] οὐδ᾽ ἄλλην τινὰ τῶν κατὰ τὴν ἁφὴν\r\nδιαφορῶν, οὔκουν οὐδὲ γεῦσιν οὐδὲ ὀδμήν, ὄψει δὲ μόνον ὑποπίπτει πρὸς\r\nἐνέργειαν ὑπὸ τοῦ φωτὸς ἡ τοιαύτη φύσις ἀγομένη. τὸ δὲ φῶς εἶδός ἐστι\r\nταύτης οἷον ὕλης ὑπεστρωμένης καὶ παρεκτεινομένης τοῖς σώμασιν. αὐτοῦ δὲ\r\nτοῦ φωτὸς ὄντος ἀσωμάτου ἀκρότης ἂν εἴη τις καὶ ὥσπερ ἄνθος ἀκτῖνες. ἡ μὲν\r\nοὖν τῶν Φοινίκων δόξα, σοφῶν τὰ θεῖα καὶ ἐπιστημόνων, ἄχραντον εἶναι\r\nἐνέργειαν αὐτοῦ τοῦ καθαροῦ [B] νοῦ τὴν ἁπανταχῇ προϊοῦσαν αὐγὴν ἔφη· οὐκ\r\nἀπᾴδει δὲ οὐδὲ ὁ λόγος, εἴπερ αὐτὸ τὸ φῶς ἀσώματον, εἴ τις αὐτοῦ μηδὲ τὴν\r\nπηγὴν ὑπολάβοι σῶμα, νοῦ δὲ ἐνέργειαν ἄχραντον εἰς τὴν οἰκείαν ἕδραν\r\nἐλλαμπομένην, ἣ τοῦ παντὸς οὐρανοῦ τὸ μέσον εἴληχεν, ὅθεν ἐπιλάμπουσα\r\nπάσης μὲν εὐτονίας πληροῖ τοὺς οὐρανίους κύκλους, πάντα δὲ περιλάμπει θείῳ\r\nκαὶ ἀχράντῳ φωτί. τὰ μέντοι ἐν τοῖς θεοῖς ἔργα προϊόντα παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ μετρίως\r\nγε(638) ἡμῖν ὀλίγῳ πρότερον εἴρηται(639) καὶ ῥηθήσεται μετ᾽ ὀλίγον.

And\r\nof this there are clear proofs for one who studies the unseen world in the\r\nlight of things seen. For in the first place, is not light itself a sort\r\nof incorporeal and divine form of the transparent in a state of activity?\r\nAnd as for the transparent itself, whatever it is, since it is the\r\nunderlying basis, so to speak, of all the elements, and is a form\r\npeculiarly belonging to them, it is not like the corporeal or compounded,\r\nnor does it admit qualities peculiar to corporeal substance.(643) You will\r\nnot therefore say that heat is a property of the transparent, or its\r\nopposite cold, nor will you assign to it hardness or softness or any other\r\nof the various attributes connected with touch or taste or smell; but a\r\nnature of this sort is obvious to sight alone, since it is brought into\r\nactivity by light. And light is a form of this substance, so to speak,\r\nwhich is the substratum of and coextensive with the heavenly bodies. And\r\nof light, itself incorporeal, the culmination and flower, so to speak, is\r\nthe sun’s rays. Now the doctrine of the Phoenicians, who were wise and\r\nlearned in sacred lore, declared that the rays of light everywhere\r\ndiffused are the undefiled incarnation of pure mind. And in harmony with\r\nthis is our theory, seeing that light itself is incorporeal, if one should\r\nregard its fountainhead, not as corporeal, but as the undefiled activity\r\nof mind(644) pouring light into its own abode: and this is assigned to the\r\nmiddle of the whole firmament, whence it sheds its rays and fills the\r\nheavenly spheres with vigour of every kind and illumines all things with\r\nlight divine and undefiled. Now the activities proceeding from it and\r\nexercised among the gods have been, in some measure at least, described by\r\nme a little earlier and will shortly be further spoken of. But all that we\r\nsee merely with the sight at first is a name only, deprived of activity,\r\nunless we add thereto the guidance and aid of light. For what, speaking\r\ngenerally, could be seen, were it not first brought into touch with light\r\nin order that, I suppose, it may receive a form, as matter is brought\r\nunder the hand of a craftsman? And indeed molten gold in the rough is\r\nsimply gold, and not yet a statue or an image, until the craftsman give it\r\nits proper shape. So too all the objects of sight, unless they are brought\r\nunder the eyes of the beholder together with light, are altogether\r\ndeprived of visibility. Accordingly by giving the power of sight to those\r\nwho see, and the power of being seen to the objects of sight, it brings to\r\nperfection, by means of a single activity, two faculties, namely vision\r\nand visibility.(645) And in forms and substance are expressed its\r\nperfecting powers.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ τοῦτο μὲν ἴσως λεπτότερον· ᾧ δὲ παρακολουθοῦμεν ξύμπαντες, ἀμαθεῖς\r\nκαὶ ἰδιῶται, φιλόσοφοι καὶ λόγιοι, τίνα ἐν τῷ παντὶ δύναμιν ἀνίσχων ἔχει\r\nκαὶ καταδυόμενος ὁ θεός; νύκτα καὶ ἡμέραν ἐργάζεται καὶ μεθίστησι φανερῶς\r\nκαὶ τρέπει τὸ πᾶν.

Night and day\r\nhe creates, and before our eyes changes and sways the universe. But to\r\nwhich of the other heavenly bodies does this power belong? How then can we\r\nnow fail to believe, in view of this, in respect also to things more\r\ndivine that the invisible and divine tribes of intellectual gods above the\r\nheavens are filled with power that works for good by him, even by him to\r\nwhom the whole band of the heavenly bodies yields place, and whom all\r\ngenerated things follow, piloted by his providence? For that the planets\r\ndance about him as their king, in certain intervals, fixed in relation to\r\nhim, and revolve in a circle with perfect accord, making certain halts,\r\nand pursuing to and fro their orbit,(647) as those who are learned in the\r\nstudy of the spheres call their visible motions; and that the light of the\r\nmoon waxes and wanes varying in proportion to its distance from the sun,\r\nis, I think, clear to all. Then is it not natural that we should suppose\r\nthat the more venerable ordering of bodies among the intellectual gods\r\ncorresponds to this arrangement?)\r\n\r\nΛάβωμεν οὖν ἐξ ἁπάντων τὸ μὲν τελεσιουργὸν ἐκ τοῦ παντὸς ἀποφαίνειν ὁρᾶν\r\nτὰ ὁρατικά· τελειοῖ γὰρ αὐτὰ διὰ τοῦ φωτός· τὸ δὲ δημιουργικὸν καὶ\r\nγόνιμον(648) ἀπὸ τῆς περὶ τὸ ξύμπαν μεταβολῆς, τὸ δὲ ἐν ἑνὶ πόντων\r\nσυνεκτικὸν ἀπὸ τῆς περὶ τὰς κινήσεις πρὸς ἓν καὶ τὸ αὐτὸ συμφωνίας, τὸ δὲ\r\nμέσον ἐξ αὐτοῦ(649) μέσου, τὸ δὲ τοῖς νοεροῖς αὐτὸν ἐνιδρύσθαι βασιλέα ἐκ\r\nτῆς ἐν τοῖς πλανωμένοις μέσης τάξεως.

Now if we see that these powers, or\r\npowers of similar importance, belong to any one of the other visible\r\ndeities, let us not assign to Helios leadership among the gods. But if he\r\nhas nothing in common with those other gods except his beneficent energy,\r\nand of this too he gives them all a share, then let us call to witness the\r\npriests of Cyprus who set up common altars to Helios and Zeus; but even\r\nbefore them let us summon as witness Apollo, who sits in council with our\r\ngod. For this god declares: “Zeus, Hades, Helios Serapis, three gods in\r\none godhead!”(657) Let us then assume that, among the intellectual gods,\r\nHelios and Zeus have a joint or rather a single sovereignty. Hence I think\r\nthat with reason Plato called Hades a wise god.(658) And we call this same\r\ngod Hades Serapis also, namely the Unseen(659) and Intellectual, to whom\r\nPlato says the souls of those who have lived most righteously and justly\r\nmount upwards. For let no one conceive of him as the god whom the legends\r\nteach us to shudder at, but as the mild and placable, since he completely\r\nfrees our souls from generation: and the souls that he has thus freed he\r\ndoes not nail to other bodies, punishing them and exacting penalties, but\r\nhe carries aloft and lifts up our souls to the intelligible world. And\r\nthat this doctrine is not wholly new, but that Homer and Hesiod the most\r\nvenerable of the poets held it before us, whether this was their own view\r\nor, like seers, they were divinely inspired with a sacred frenzy for the\r\ntruth, is evident from the following. Hesiod, in tracing his genealogy,\r\nsaid(660) that Helios is the son of Hyperion and Thea, intimating thereby\r\nthat he is the true son of him who is above all things. For who else could\r\nHyperion(661) be? And is not Thea herself, in another fashion, said to be\r\nmost divine of beings? But as for a union or marriage, let us not conceive\r\nof such a thing, since that is the incredible and paradoxical trifling of\r\nthe poetic Muse. But let us believe that his father and sire was the most\r\ndivine and supreme being; and who else could have this nature save him who\r\ntranscends all things, the central point and goal of all things that\r\nexist? And Homer calls him Hyperion after his father and shows his\r\nunconditioned nature, superior to all constraint. For Zeus, as Homer says,\r\nsince he is lord of all constrains the other gods. And when, in the course\r\nof the myth, Helios says that on account of the impiety of the comrades of\r\nOdysseus(662) he will forsake Olympus, Zeus no longer says,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Αὐτῇ κεν γαίῃ ἐρύσαιμ᾽ αὐτῇ τε θαλάσσῃ,\r\n\r\n    (“Then with very earth would I draw you up and the sea\r\n    withal,”(663))\r\n\r\n\r\nοὐδὲ ἀπειλεῖ δεσμὸν οὐδὲ βίαν, ἀλλὰ τὴν δίκην φησὶν ἐπιθήσειν τοῖς\r\nἡμαρτηκόσιν, αὐτὸν δὲ ἀξιοῖ φαίνειν ἐν τοῖς θεοῖς. ἆρ᾽ οὐξὶ διὰ τούτων\r\nπρὸς τῷ αὐτεξουσίῳ καὶ τελεσιουργὸν εἶναί φησι τὸν Ἥλιον; ἐπὶ τί γὰρ αὐτοῦ\r\nοἱ θεοὶ δέονται, πλὴν εἰ μὴ πρὸς τὴν οὐσίαν [B] καὶ τὸ εἶναι ἀφανῶς\r\nἐναστράπτων ὧν ἔφαμεν ἀγαθῶν ἀποπληρωτικὸς τυγχάνοι; τὸ γὰρ\r\n\r\n(nor does he threaten him with fetters or violence, but he says that he\r\nwill inflict punishment on the guilty and bids Helios go on shining among\r\nthe gods. Does he not thereby declare that besides being unconditioned,\r\nHelios has also the power to perfect? For why do the gods need him unless\r\nby sending his light, himself invisible, on their substance and existence,\r\nhe fulfils for them the blessings of which I spoke? For when Homer says\r\nthat)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἠέλιόν τ᾽ ἀκάμαντα βοῶπις πότνια Ἥρη\r\n    Πέμψεν ἐπ᾽ Ὠκεανοῖο ῥοὰς ἀέκοντα νέεσθαι(664)\r\n\r\n    (“Ox‐eyed Hera, the queen, sent unwearied Helios to go, all\r\n    unwilling, to the streams of Oceanus,”)\r\n\r\n\r\nπρὸ τοῦ καιροῦ φησι νομισθῆναι τὴν νύκτα διὰ τινα χαλεπὴν ὁμίχλην. αὕτη\r\nγὰρ ἡ θεός που, καὶ ἄλλοθι τῆς ποιήσεώς φησιν,(665)\r\n\r\n(he means that, by reason of a heavy mist, it was thought to be night\r\nbefore the proper time. And this mist is surely the goddess herself, and\r\nin another place also in the poem he says,)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ἠέρα δ᾽ Ἥρη\r\n    Πίτνα πρόσθε βαθεῖαν. [C]\r\n\r\n    (“Hera spread before them a thick mist.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nἁλλὰ τὰ μὲν τῶν ποιητῶν χαίρειν ἐάσωμεν· ἔχει γὰρ μετὰ τοῦ θείου πολὺ καὶ\r\nτἀνθρώπινον· ἃ δὲ ἡμᾶς ἔοικεν αὐτὸς ὁ θεὸς διδάσκειν ὑπέρ τε αὑτοῦ καὶ τῶν\r\nἄλλων, ἐκεῖνα ἤδη διέλθωμεν.\r\n\r\n(But let us leave the stories of the poets alone. For along with what is\r\ninspired they contain much also that is merely human. And let me now\r\nrelate what the god himself seems to teach us, both about himself and the\r\nother gods.)\r\n\r\nὉ περὶ γῆν τόπος ἐν τῷ γίνεσθαι τὸ εἶναι ἔχει. τίς οὖν ἐστιν ὁ τὴν\r\nἀιδιότητα δωρούμενος αὐτῷ; ἆρ᾽ οὐχ ὁ ταῦτα μέτροις ὡρισμένοις συνέχων;\r\nἄπειρον μὲν γὰρ [D] εἶναι φύσιν σώματος οὐχ οἷόν τ᾽ ἦν, ἐπεὶ μηδὲ\r\nἀγέννητός ἐστι μηδὲ αὐθυπόστατος· ἑκ δὲ τῆς οὐσίας εἰ πάντως ἐγίνετό τι\r\nσυνεχῶς, ἀνελύετο δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν μηδέν, ἐπέλειπεν ἂν τῶν γιγνομένων ἡ οὐσία.\r\nτὴν δὴ τοιαύτην φύσιν ὁ θεὸς ὅδε μέτρῳ κινούμενος προσιὼν μὲν ὀρθοῖ καὶ\r\nἐγείρει, πόρρω δὲ ἀπιὼν ἐλαττοῖ καὶ φθείρει, μᾶλλον δὲ αὐτὸς ἀεὶ ζωοποιεὶ\r\nκινῶν καὶ ἐποχετεύων αὐτῇ τὴν ζωὴν· ἡ δὲ ἀπόλειψις αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ πρὸς θάτερα\r\n[138] μετάστασις αἰτία γίνεται φθορᾶς τοῖς φθίνουσιν. ἀεὶ μὲν οὖν ἡ παρ᾽\r\nαὐτοῦ τῶν ἀγαθῶν δόσις ἴση κάτεισιν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· ἄλλοτε γὰρ ἄλλη δέχεται\r\nτὰ τοιαῦτα χώρα πρὸς τὸ μήτε τὴν γένεσιν ἐπιλείπειν μήτε τοῦ συνήθους ποτὲ\r\nτὸν θεὸν ἔλαττον ἢ πλέον εὖ ποιῆσαι τὸν παθητὸν κόσμον. ἡ γὰρ ταυτότης\r\nὥσπερ τῆς οὐσίας, οὕτω δὲ καὶ τῆς ἐνεργείας ἐν τοῖς θεοῖς καὶ πρό γε τῶν\r\nἄλλων παρὰ τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν ὅλων Ἡλίῳ, ὃς καὶ τὴν κίνησιν ἁπλουστάτην ὑπὲρ\r\nἅπαντας ποιεῖται τοὺς τῷ παντὶ [B] τὴν ἐναντίαν φερομένους· ὃ δὴ καὶ αὐτὸ\r\nτῆς πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους ὑπεροχῆς αὐτοῦ σημεῖον ποιεῖται ὁ κλεινὸς\r\nἈριστοτέλης· ἀλλὰ καὶ παρὰ τῶν ἄλλων νοερῶν θεῶν οὐκ ἀμυδραὶ καθήκουσιν\r\nεἰς τὸν κόσμον τόνδε δυνάμεις. εἶτα τί τοῦτο; μὴ γὰρ ἀποκλείομεν τοὺς\r\nἄλλους τούτῳ τὴν ἡγεμονίαν ὁμολογοῦντες δεδόσθαι; πολὺ δὲ πλέον ἐκ τῶν\r\nἐμφανῶν ἀξιοῦμεν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀφανῶν πιστεύειν. ὥσπερ [C] γὰρ τὰς ἐνδιδομένας\r\nἅπασιν ἐκεῖθεν δυνάμεις εἰς τὴν γῆν οὗτος φαίνεται τελεσιουργῶν καὶ\r\nσυναρμόζων πρός τε ἑαυτὸν καὶ τὸ πᾶν, οὕτω δὴ νομιστέον καὶ ἐν τοῖς\r\nἀφανέσιν αὐτῶν τὰς συνουσίας ἔχειν πρὸς ἀλλήλας, ἡγεμόνα μὲν ἐκείνην,\r\nσυμφωνούσας δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν τὰς ἄλλας ἅμα. ἐπεὶ καί, εί μέσον ἔφαμεν ἐν\r\nμέσοις ἱδρῦσθαι τὸν θεὸν τοῖς νοεροῖς θεοῖς, ποταπή τις ἡ μεσότης ἐστὶν ὧν\r\nαὖ χρὴ μέσον αὐτὸν ὑπολαβεῖν, αὐτὸς ἡμῖν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰπεῖν Ἥλιος δοίη.\r\n\r\n(The region of the earth contains being in a state of becoming. Then who\r\nendows it with imperishability? Is it not he(666) who keeps it all\r\ntogether by means of definite limits? For that the nature of being should\r\nbe unlimited was not possible, since it is neither uncreated nor self‐\r\nsubsistent. And if from being something were generated absolutely without\r\nceasing and nothing were resolved back into it, the substance of things\r\ngenerated would fail. Accordingly this god, moving in due measure, raises\r\nup and stimulates this substance when he approaches it, and when he\r\ndeparts to a distance he diminishes and destroys it; or rather he himself\r\ncontinually revivifies it by giving it movement and flooding it with life.\r\nAnd his departure and turning in the other direction is the cause of decay\r\nfor things that perish. Ever does his gift of blessings descend evenly\r\nupon the earth. For now one country now another receives them, to the end\r\nthat becoming may not cease nor the god ever benefit less or more than is\r\nhis custom this changeful world. For sameness, as of being so also of\r\nactivity, exists among the gods, and above all the others in the case of\r\nthe King of the All, Helios; and he also makes the simplest movement of\r\nall the heavenly bodies(667) that travel in a direction opposite to the\r\nwhole. In fact this is the very thing that the celebrated Aristotle makes\r\na proof of his superiority, compared with the others. Nevertheless from\r\nthe other intellectual gods also, forces clearly discernible descend to\r\nthis world. And now what does this mean? Are we not excluding the others\r\nwhen we assert that the leadership has been assigned to Helios? Nay, far\r\nrather do I think it right from the visible to have faith about the\r\ninvisible.(668) For even as this god is seen to complete and to adapt to\r\nhimself and to the universe the powers that are bestowed on the earth from\r\nthe other gods for all things, after the same fashion we must believe that\r\namong the invisible gods also there is intercourse with one another; his\r\nmode of intercourse being that of a leader, while the modes of intercourse\r\nof the others are at the same time in harmony with his. For since we said\r\nthat the god is established midmost among the midmost intellectual gods,\r\nmay King Helios himself grant to us to tell what is the nature of that\r\nmiddleness among things of which we must regard him as the middle.)\r\n\r\n[D] Μεσότητα μὲν δή φαμεν οὐ τὴν ἐν τοῖς ἐναντίοις θεωρουμένην ἴσον\r\nἀφεστῶσαν τῶν ἄκρων, οἷον ἐπὶ χρωμάτων τὸ ξανθὸν ἢ φαιόν, ἐπὶ δὲ θερμοῦ\r\nκαὶ ψυχροῦ τὸ χλιαρόν, καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἑνωτικὴν καὶ συνάγουσαν\r\nτὰ διεστῶτα, ὁποίαν τινά φησιν Ἐμπεδοκλῆς τὴν ἁρμονίαν ἐξορίζων αὐτῆς\r\nπαντελῶς τὸ νεῖκος. τίνα οὖν ἐστιν, ἃ συνάγει, καὶ τίνων ἐστὶ μέσος; φημὶ\r\nδὴ οὖν ὅτι τῶν τε ἐμφανῶν καὶ περικοσμίων θεῶν καὶ τῶν ἀύλων καὶ νοητῶν,\r\n[139] οἳ περὶ τἀγαθόν εἰσιν, ὥσπερ πολυπλασιαζομένης ἀπαθῶς καὶ ἄνευ\r\nπροσθήκης τῆς νοητῆς καὶ θείας οὐσίας. ὡς μὲν οὖν ἐστι μέση τις, οὐκ ἀπὸ\r\nτῶν ἄκρων κραθεῖσα, τελεία δὲ καὶ ἀμιγὴς ἀφ᾽ ὅλων τῶν θεῶν ἐμφανῶν τε καὶ\r\nἀφανῶν καὶ αἰσθητῶν καὶ νοητῶν ἡ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἡλίου νοερὰ καὶ πάνκαλος\r\nοὐσία, καὶ ὁποίαν τινὰ χρὴ τὴν μεσότητα νομίζειν, εἴρηται. εἰ δὲ δεῖ καὶ\r\nτοῖς καθ᾽ ἕκαστον ἐπεξελθεῖν, ἵν᾽ αὐτοῦ καὶ κατ᾽ εἴδη τὸ μέσον τῆς οὐσίας,\r\nὅπως ἔχει πρός τε τὰ πρῶτα καὶ τὰ τελευταῖα,(669) [B] τῷ νῷ κατίδωμεν, εἰ\r\nκαὶ μὴ πάντα διελθεῖν ῥᾴδιον, ἀλλ᾽ οὖν τὰ δυνατὰ φράσαι πειραθῶμεν.\r\n\r\n(Now “middleness”(670) we define not as that mean which in opposites is\r\nseen to be equally remote from the extremes, as, for instance, in colours,\r\ntawny or dusky, and warm in the case of hot and cold, and the like, but\r\nthat which unifies and links together what is separate; for instance the\r\nsort of thing that Empedocles(671) means by Harmony when from it he\r\naltogether eliminates Strife. And now what does Helios link together, and\r\nof what is he the middle? I assert then that he is midway between the\r\nvisible gods who surround the universe and the immaterial and intelligible\r\ngods who surround the Good—for the intelligible and divine substance is as\r\nit were multiplied without external influence and without addition. For\r\nthat the intellectual and wholly beautiful substance of King Helios is\r\nmiddle in the sense of being unmixed with extremes, complete in itself,\r\nand distinct from the whole number of the gods, visible and invisible,\r\nboth those perceptible by sense and those which are intelligible only, I\r\nhave already declared, and also in what sense we must conceive of his\r\nmiddleness. But if I must also describe these things one by one, in order\r\nthat we may discern with our intelligence how his intermediary nature, in\r\nits various forms, is related both to the highest and the lowest, even\r\nthough it is not easy to recount it all, yet let me try to say what can be\r\nsaid.)\r\n\r\nἛν παντελῶς τὸ νοητὸν ἀεὶ προüπάρχον, τὰ(672) δὲ πάντα ὁμοῦ συνειληφὸς ἐν\r\nτῷ ἑνί. τί δέ; οὐχὶ καὶ ὁ σύμπας κόσμος ἕν ἐστι ζῷον ὅλον δι᾽ ὅλου ψυχῆς\r\nκαὶ νοῦ πλῆρες, τέλειον ἐκ μερῶν τελείων;(673) ταύτης οὖν τῆς διπλῆς\r\nἑνοειδοῦς τελειότητος· φημὶ δὲ τῆς ἐν τῷ νοητῷ πάντα ἐν ἑνὶ συνεχούσης,\r\nκαὶ τῆς περὶ τὸν κόσμον [C] εἰς μίαν καὶ τὴν αὐτὴν φύσιν τελείαν\r\nσυναγομένης ἑνώσεως· ἡ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἡλίου μέση τελειότης ἑνοειδής ἐστιν,\r\nἐν τοῖς νοεροῖς ἱδρυμένη θεοῖς. ἀλλὰ δὴ τὸ μετὰ τοῦτο συνοχή τίς ἐστιν ἐν\r\nτῷ νοητῷ τῶν θεῶν κόσμῳ πάντα πρὸς τὸ ἓν συντάττουσα. τί δέ; οὐχὶ καὶ περὶ\r\nτὸν οὐρανὸν φαίνεται κύκλῳ πορευομένη τοῦ πέμπτου σώματος οὐσία,(674) ἣ\r\nπάντα συνέχει τὰ μέρη καὶ σφίγγει πρὸς αὑτὰ συνέχουσα τὸ φύσει σκεδαστὸν\r\nαὐτῶν καὶ ἀπορρέον ἀπ᾽ ἀλλήλων; δύο δὴ ταύτας τὰς(675) οὐσίας συνοχῆς\r\nαἰτίας, τὴν μὲν ἐν τοῖς νοητοῖς, [D] τὴν δὲ ἐν τοῖς αἰσθητοῖς φαινομένην ὁ\r\nβασιλεὺς Ἥλιος εἰς ταὐτὸ συνάπτει, τῆς μὲν μιμούμενος τὴν συνεκτικὴν\r\nδύναμιν ἐν τοῖς νοεροῖς, ἅτε ἐξ αὐτῆς προελθών, τῆς δὲ τελευταίας\r\nπροκατάρχων, ἣ περὶ τὸν ἐμφανῆ θεωρεῖται κόσμον. μή ποτε οὖν καὶ τὸ\r\nαὐθυπόστατον πρῶτον μὲν ἐν τοῖς νοητοῖς ὑπάρχον, τελευταῖον δ᾽ [140] ἐν\r\nτοῖς κατ᾽ οὐρανὸν φαινομένοις μέσην ἔχει τὴν τοῦ βασιλέως οὐσίαν\r\nαὐθυπόστατον Ἡλίου, ἀφ᾽ ἧς κάτεισιν οἰσίας πρωτουργοῦ εἰς τὸν ἐμφανῆ\r\nκόσμον ἡ περιλάμπουσα τὰ σύμπαντα αὐγή; πάλιν δὲ κατ᾽ ἄλλο σκοποῦντι εἷς\r\nμὲν ὁ τῶν ὅλων δημιουργός, πολλοὶ δὲ οἱ κατ᾽ οὐρανὸν περιπολοῦντες\r\nδημιουργικοὶ θεοί. μέσην ἄρα καὶ τούτων τὴν ἀφ᾽ Ἡλίου καθήκουσαν εἰς τὸν\r\nκόσμον δημιουργίαν θετέον.

Again is not our whole world also\r\none complete living organism, wholly throughout the whole of it full of\r\nsoul and intelligence, “perfect, with all its parts perfect”? Midway then\r\nbetween this uniform two‐fold perfection—I mean that one kind of unity\r\nholds together in one all that exists in the intelligible world, while the\r\nother kind of unity unites in the visible world all things into one and\r\nthe same perfect nature—between these, I say, is the uniform perfection of\r\nKing Helios, established among the intellectual gods. There is, however,\r\nnext in order, a sort of binding force in the intelligible world of the\r\ngods, which orders all things into one. Again is there not visible in the\r\nheavens also, travelling in its orbit, the nature of the Fifth Substance,\r\nwhich links and compresses(676) together all the parts, holding together\r\nthings that by nature are prone to scatter and to fall away from one\r\nanother? These existences, therefore, which are two causes of connection,\r\none in the intelligible world, while the other appears in the world of\r\nsense‐perception, King Helios combines into one, imitating the synthetic\r\npower of the former among the intellectual gods, seeing that he proceeds\r\nfrom it, and subsisting prior to the latter which is seen in the visible\r\nworld. Then must not the unconditioned also, which exists primarily in the\r\nintelligible world, and finally among the visible bodies in the heavens,\r\npossess midway between these two the unconditioned substance of King\r\nHelios, and from that primary creative substance do not the rays of his\r\nlight, illumining all things, descend to the visible world? Again, to take\r\nanother point of view, the creator of the whole is one, but many are the\r\ncreative gods(677) who revolve in the heavens. Midmost therefore of these\r\nalso we must place the creative activity which descends into the world\r\nfrom Helios. But also the power of generating life is abundant and\r\noverflowing in the intelligible world; and our world also appears to be\r\nfull of generative life. It is therefore evident that the life‐generating\r\npower of King Helios also is midway between both the worlds: and the\r\nphenomena of our world also bear witness to this. For some forms he\r\nperfects, others he makes, or adorns, or wakes to life, and there is no\r\nsingle thing which, apart from the creative power derived from Helios, can\r\ncome to light and to birth. And further, besides this, if we should\r\ncomprehend the pure and undefiled and immaterial substance(678) among the\r\nintelligible gods—to which nothing external is added, nor has any alien\r\nthing a place therein, but it is filled with its own unstained purity—and\r\nif we should comprehend also the pure and unmixed nature of unstained and\r\ndivine substance, whose elements are wholly unmixed, and which, in the\r\nvisible universe, surrounds the substance that revolves,(679) here also we\r\nshould discover the radiant and stainless substance of King Helios, midway\r\nbetween the two; that is to say, midway between the immaterial purity that\r\nexists among the intelligible gods, and that perfect purity, unstained and\r\nfree from birth and death, that exists in the world which we can perceive.\r\nAnd the greatest proof of this is that not even the light which comes down\r\nnearest to the earth from the sun is mixed with anything, nor does it\r\nadmit dirt and defilement, but remains wholly pure and without stain and\r\nfree from external influences among all existing things.)\r\n\r\nἜτι δὲ προσεκτέον τοῖς ἀύλοις εἴδεσι καὶ νοητοῖς, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς αἰσθητοῖς,\r\nὅσα περὶ τὴν ὕλην ἐστὶν [141] ἢ περὶ τὸ ὑποκείμενον. ἀναφανήσεται πάλιν\r\nἐνταῦθα μέσον τὸ νοερὸν τῶν περὶ τὸν μέγαν Ἥλιον εἰδῶν, ὑφ᾽ ὧν καὶ τὰ περὶ\r\nτὴν ὕλην εἴδη βοηθεῖται μήποτε ἂν δυνηθέντα μήτε εἶναι μήτε σώζεσθαι μὴ\r\nπαρ᾽ ἐκείνου πρὸς τὴν οὐσίαν συνεργούμενα. τί γάρ; οὐχ οὗτος ἐστι τῆς\r\nδιακρίσεως τῶν εἰδῶν καὶ συγκρίσεως τῆς ὕλης αἴτιος, οὐ νοεῖν ἡμῖν αὑτὸν\r\nμόνον παρέχων, ἁλλὰ καὶ ὁρᾶν ὄμμασιν; ἡ γάρ τοι τῶν ἀκτίνων εἰς πάντα τὸν\r\nκόσμον διανομὴ καὶ ἡ τοῦ φωτὸς ἕνωσις [B] τὴν δημιουργικὴν ἐνδείκνυται\r\nδιάκρισιν τῆς ποιήσεως.\r\n\r\n(But we must go on to consider the immaterial and intelligible forms,(680)\r\nand also those visible forms which are united with matter or the\r\nsubstratum. Here again, the intellectual will be found to be midmost among\r\nthe forms that surround mighty Helios, by which forms in their turn the\r\nmaterial forms are aided; for they never could have existed or been\r\npreserved, had they not been brought, by his aid, into connection with\r\nbeing. For consider: is not he the cause of the separation of the forms,\r\nand of the combination of matter, in that he not only permits us to\r\ncomprehend his very self, but also to behold him with our eyes? For the\r\ndistribution of his rays over the whole universe, and the unifying power\r\nof his light, prove him to be the master workman who gives an individual\r\nexistence to everything that is created.)\r\n\r\nΠολλῶν δὲ ὄντων ἔτι περὶ τὴν οὐσίαν τοῦ θεοῦ τῶν φαινομένων ἀγαθῶν, ἃ δὴ\r\nὅτι μέσος ἐστὶ τῶν τε νοητῶν καὶ τῶν ἐγκοσμίων θεῶν παρίστησιν, ἐπὶ τὴν\r\nτελευταίαν αὐτοῦ μετίωμεν ἐμφανῆ λῆξιν. πρώτη μὲν οὖν ἐστιν αὐτοῦ τῶν περὶ\r\nτὸν τελευταῖον κόσμον ἡ τῶν ἡλιακῶν ἀγγέλων οἷον ἐν παραδείγματι τὴν ἰδέαν\r\nκαὶ τὴν ὑπόστασιν ἔχουσα· μετὰ ταύτην δὲ ἡ τῶν αἰσθητῶν γεννητική, [C] ἧς\r\nτὸ μὲν τιμιώτερον οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀστέρων ἔχει τὴν αἰτίαν, τὸ δὲ ὑποδεέστερον\r\nἐπιτροπεύει τὴν γένεσιν, ἐξ ἀιδίου περιέχον αὐτῆς ἐν ἑαυτῷ τὴν ἀγέννητον\r\nαἰτίαν. ἅπαντα μὲν οὖν τὰ περὶ τὴν οὐσίαν τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦδε διελθεῖν οὐδὲ εἴ\r\nτῳ δοίη νοῆσαι αὐτὰ(681) ὁ θεὸς οὗτος δυνατόν, ὅπου καὶ τὰ πάντα\r\nπεριλαβεῖν τῷ νῷ ἔμοιγε φαίνεται ἀδύνατον.\r\n\r\n(Now though there are many more blessings connected with the substance of\r\nthe god and apparent to us, which show that he is midway between the\r\nintelligible and the mundane gods(682) let us proceed to his last visible\r\nprovince. His first province then in the last of the worlds is, as though\r\nby way of a pattern, to give form and personality to the sun’s\r\nangels.(683) Next is his province of generating the world of sense‐\r\nperception, of which the more honourable part contains the cause of the\r\nheavens and the heavenly bodies, while the inferior part guides this our\r\nworld of becoming, and from eternity contains in itself the uncreated\r\ncause of that world. Now to describe all the properties of the substance\r\nof this god, even though the god himself should grant one to comprehend\r\nthem, is impossible, seeing that even to grasp them all with the mind is,\r\nin my opinion, beyond our power.)\r\n\r\nἘπεὶ δὲ πολλὰ διεληλύθαμεν, ἐπιθετέον ὥσπερ σφραγῖδα τῷ λόγῳ τῷδε\r\nμέλλοντας ἐφ᾽ ἕτερα μεταβαίνειν οὐκ ἐλάττονος [D] τῆς θεωρίας δεόμενα. τίς\r\nοὖν ἡ σφραγὶς καὶ οἷον ἐν κεφαλαίῳ τὰ πάντα περιλαμβάνουσα ἡ περὶ τῆς\r\nοὐσίας τοῦ θεοῦ νόησις, αὐτὸς ἡμῖν ἐπὶ νοῦν θείη βουλομένοις ἐν βραχεῖ\r\nσυνελεῖν τήν τε αἰτίαν, ἀφ᾽ ἧς προῆλθε, καὶ αὐτὸς ὅστις ἐστί, τίνων τε\r\nἀποπληροῖ τὸν ἐμφανῆ κόσμον. ῥητέον οὖν ὡς ἐξ ἑνὸς μὲν προῆλθε τοῦ θεοῦ\r\nεἷς ἀφ᾽ ἑνὸς τοῦ νοητοῦ κόσμου βασιλεὺς Ἥλιος, [142] τῶν νοερῶν θεῶν μέσος\r\nἐν μέσοις τεταγμένος κατὰ παντοίαν μεσότητα, τὴν ὁμόφρονα καὶ φίλην καὶ τὰ\r\nδιεστῶτα συνάγουσαν, εἰς ἕνωσιν ἄγων τὰ τελευταῖα τοῖς πρώτοις,\r\nτελειότητος καὶ συνοχῆς καὶ γονίμου ζωῆς καὶ τῆς ἑνοειδοῦς οὐσίας τὰ μέσα\r\nἔχων ἐν ἑαυτῷ, τῷ τε αἰσθητῷ κόσμῳ παντοίων ἀγαθῶν προηγούμενος,(684) οὐ\r\nμόνον δι᾽ ἧς αὐτὸς αὐγῆς περιλάμπει κοσμῶν καὶ φαιδρύνων, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν\r\nοὐσίαν τῶν ἡλιακῶν ἀγγέλων(685) ἑαυτῷ συνυποστήσας καὶ τὴν ἀγέννητον\r\nαἰτίαν [B] τῶν γινομένων περιέχων, ἔτι τε πρὸ ταύτης τῶν ἀιδίων σωμάτων\r\nτὴν ἀγήρω καὶ μόνιμον τῆς ζωῆς αἰτίαν.\r\n\r\n(But since I have already described many of them, I must set a seal, as it\r\nwere, on this discourse, now that I am about to pass to other subjects\r\nthat demand no less investigation. What then that seal is, and what is the\r\nknowledge of the god’s substance that embraces all these questions, and as\r\nit were sums them up under one head, may he himself suggest to my mind,\r\nsince I desire to describe in a brief summary both the cause from which he\r\nproceeded, and his own nature, and those blessings with which he fills the\r\nvisible world. This then we must declare, that King Helios is One and\r\nproceeds from one god, even from the intelligible world which is itself\r\nOne; and that he is midmost of the intellectual gods, stationed in their\r\nmidst by every kind of mediateness that is harmonious and friendly, and\r\nthat joins what is sundered; and that he brings together into one the last\r\nand the first, having in his own person the means of completeness, of\r\nconnection, of generative life and of uniform being: and that for the\r\nworld which we can perceive he initiates blessings of all sorts, not only\r\nby means of the light with which he illumines it, adorning it and giving\r\nit its splendour, but also because he calls into existence, along with\r\nhimself, the substance of the Sun’s angels; and that finally in himself he\r\ncomprehends the ungenerated cause of things generated, and further, and\r\nprior to this, the ageless and abiding cause of the life of the\r\nimperishable bodies.(686))\r\n\r\nἋ μὲν οὖν περὶ τῆς οὐσίας ἐχρῆν εἰπεῖν τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦδε, καίτοι τῶν πλείστων\r\nπαραλειφθέντων, εἴρηται ὅμως οὐκ ὀλίγα· ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸ τῶν δυνάμεων αὐτοῦ\r\nπλῆθος καὶ τὸ τῶν ἐνεργειῶν κάλλος τοσοῦτόν ἐστιν, ὥστε εἶναι τῶν περὶ τὴν\r\nοὐσίαν αὐτοῦ θεωρουμένων ὑπερβολήν, ἐπεὶ καὶ πέφυκε τὰ θεῖα προϊόντα εἰς\r\nτὸ ἐμφανὲς πληθύνεσθαι διὰ τὸ περιὸν καὶ γόνιμον τῆς ζωῆς, ὅρα τί\r\nδράσομεν, [C] οἳ πρὸς ἀχανὲς πέλαγος ἀποδυόμεθα, μόγις καὶ ἀγαπητῶς ἐκ\r\nπολλοῦ τοῦ πρόσθεν ἀναπαυόμενοι λόγου. τολμητέον δ᾽ ὅμως τῷ θεῷ θαρροῦντα\r\nκαὶ πειρατέον ἅψασθαι τοῦ λόγου.\r\n\r\n(Now as for what it was right to say about the substance of this god,\r\nthough the greater part has been omitted, nevertheless much has been said.\r\nBut since the multitude of his powers and the beauty of his activities is\r\nso great that we shall now exceed the limit of what we observed about his\r\nsubstance,—for it is natural that when divine things come forth into the\r\nregion of the visible they should be multiplied, in virtue of the\r\nsuperabundance of life and life‐generating power in them,—consider what I\r\nhave to do. For now I must strip for a plunge into this fathomless sea,\r\nthough I have barely, and as best I might, taken breath, after the first\r\npart of this discourse. Venture I must, nevertheless, and putting my trust\r\nin the god endeavour to handle the theme.)\r\n\r\nΚοινῶς μὲν δὴ τὰ πρόσθεν ῥηθέντα περὶ τῆς οὐσίας αὐτοῦ ταῖς δυνάμεσι\r\nπροσήκειν ὑποληπτέον. οὐ γὰρ ἄλλο μέν ἐστιν οὐσία θεοῦ, δύναμις δὲ ἄλλο,\r\n[D] καὶ μὰ Δία τρίτον παρὰ ταῦτα ἐνέργεια. πάντα γὰρ ἅπερ βούλεται, ταῦτα\r\nἔστι καὶ δύναται καὶ ἐνεργεῖ· οὔτε γὰρ ὃ μὴ ἔστι βούλεται, οὔτε ὃ βούλεται\r\nδρᾶν οὐ σθένει, οὔθ᾽ ὃ μὴ δύναται ἐνεργεῖν ἐθέλει. ταῦτα μὲν οὖν περὶ τὸν\r\nἄνθρωπον οὐχ ὧδε ἔχει· διττὴ γάρ ἐστι μαχομένη φύσις εἰς ἓν κεκραμένη\r\nψυχῆς καὶ σώματος, τῆς μὲν θείας, τοῦ δὲ σκοτεινοῦ τε καὶ ζοφώδους· ἔοικέ\r\nτε εἶναι μάχη τις καὶ στάσις. ἐπεὶ καὶ Ἀριστοτέλης φησὶ(687) διὰ τὸ\r\nτοιοῦτο [143] μήτε τὰς ἡδονὰς ὁμολογεῖν μήτε τὰς λύπας ἀλλήλαις ἐν ἡμῖν·\r\nτὸ γὰρ θατέρᾳ, φησί, τῶν ἐν ἡμῖν φύσεων ἡδὺ τῇ πρὸς ταύτην ἀντικειμένῃ\r\nπέφυκεν ἀλγεινόν· ἐν δὲ τοῖς θεοῖς οὐδέν ἐστι τοιοῦτον·(688) οὐσίᾳ γὰρ\r\nαὐτοῖς ὑπάρχει τἀγαθὰ καὶ διηνεκῶς, οὐ ποτὲ μὲν, ποτὲ δ᾽ οὔ. πρῶτον οὖν\r\nὅσαπερ ἔφαμεν, τὴν οὐσίαν αὐτοῦ παραστῆσαι βουλόμενοι, ταῦθ᾽ ἡμῖν εἰρῆσθαι\r\nκαὶ περὶ τῶν δυνάμεων καὶ ἐνεργειῶν νομιστέον. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐν τοῖς τοιούτοις ὁ\r\nλόγος ἔοικεν ἀντιστρέφειν, ὅσα καὶ περὶ τῶν δυνάμεων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνεργειῶν\r\nἐφεξῆς σκοποῦμεν, [B] ταῦτα οὐκ ἔργα μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ οὐσίαν νομιστέον.\r\nεἰσὶ γάρ τοι θεοὶ συγγενεῖς Ἡλίῳ καὶ συμφυεῖς, τὴν ἄχραντον οὐσίαν τοῦ\r\nθεοῦ κορυφούμενοι, πληθυνόμενοι μὲν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ, περὶ αὐτὸν δὲ ἑνοειδῶς\r\nὄντες. ἄκουε δὴ πρῶτον ὅσα φασὶν οἱ τὸν οὐρανὸν οὐχ ὥσπερ ἵπποι καὶ βόες\r\nὁρῶντες ἤ τι τῶν ἀλόγων καὶ ἀμαθῶν ζῴων, ἀλλ᾽ ἐξ αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀφανῆ\r\nπολυπραγμονοῦντες φύσιν· ἔτι δὲ πρὸ τούτων, εἴ σοι φίλον, [C] περὶ τῶν\r\nὑπερκοσμίων δυνάμεων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐνεργειῶν, καὶ ἐκ μυρίων τὸ πλῆθος ὀλίγα\r\nθέασαι.\r\n\r\n(We must assume that what has just been said about his substance applies\r\nequally to his powers.(689) For it cannot be that a god’s substance is one\r\nthing, and his power another, and his activity, by Zeus, a third thing\r\nbesides these. For all that he wills he is, and can do, and puts into\r\naction. For he does not will what is not, nor does he lack power to do\r\nwhat he wills, nor does he desire to put into action what he cannot. In\r\nthe case of a human being, however, this is otherwise. For his is a two‐\r\nfold contending nature of soul and body compounded into one, the former\r\ndivine, the latter dark and clouded. Naturally, therefore, there is a\r\nbattle and a feud between them. And Aristotle also says that this is why\r\nneither the pleasures nor the pains in us harmonise with one another. For\r\nhe says that what is pleasant to one of the natures within us is painful\r\nto the nature which is its opposite. But among the gods there is nothing\r\nof this sort. For from their very nature what is good belongs to them, and\r\nperpetually, not intermittently. In the first place, then, all that I said\r\nwhen I tried to show forth his substance, I must be considered to have\r\nsaid about his powers and activities also. And since in such cases the\r\nargument is naturally convertible, all that I observe next in order\r\nconcerning his powers and activities must be considered to apply not to\r\nhis activities only, but to his substance also. For verily there are gods\r\nrelated to Helios and of like substance who sum up the stainless nature of\r\nthis god, and though in the visible world they are plural, in him they are\r\none. And now listen first to what they assert who look at the heavens, not\r\nlike horses and cattle, or some other unreasoning and ignorant\r\nanimal,(690) but from it draw their conclusions about the unseen world.\r\nBut even before this, if you please, consider his supra‐mundane powers and\r\nactivities, and out of a countless number, observe but a few.)\r\n\r\nΠρώτη δὴ τῶν δυνάμεών ἐστιν αὐτοῦ, δι᾽ ἧς ὅλην δι᾽ ὅλης τὴν νοερὰν οὐσίαν,\r\nτὰς ἀκρότητας αὐτῆς εἰς ἓν καὶ ταὐτὸ συνάγων, ἀποφαίνει μίαν. ὅσπερ γὰρ\r\nπερὶ τὸν αἰσθητόν ἐστι κόσμον ἐναργῶς κατανοῆσαι, πυρὸς καὶ γῆς εἰλημμένον\r\nἀέρα καὶ ὕδωρ ἐν μέσῳ, τῶν ἄκρων σύνδεσμον, τοῦτο οὐκ ἄν τις εἰκότως [D]\r\nἐπὶ τῆς πρὸ τῶν σωμάτων αἰτίας κεχωρισμένης, ἣ τῆς γενέσεως ἔχουσα τὴν\r\nἀρχὴν οὐκ ἔστι γένεσις, οὕτω διατετάχθαι νομίσειεν, ὥστε καὶ ἐν ἐκείνοις\r\nτὰς ἄκρας αἰτίας κεχωρισμένας πάντη τῶν σωμάτων ὑπό τινων μεσοτήτων εἰς\r\nταὐτὸ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἡλίου συναγομένας ἑνοῦσθαι περὶ αὐτόν; συντρέχει\r\nδὲ αὐτῷ καὶ ἡ τοῦ Διὸς δημιουργικὴ δύναμις, δι᾽ ἣν ἔφαμεν καὶ πρότερον\r\nἱδρῦσθαί τε αὐτοῖς ἐν Κύπρῳ καὶ ἀποδεδεῖχθαι κοινῇ τὰ τεμένη· [144] καὶ\r\nτὸν Ἀπόλλω δὲ αὐτὸν ἐμαρτυρόμεθα τῶν λόγων, ὃν εἰκὸς δήπουθεν ὑπὲρ τῆς\r\nἑαυτοῦ φύσεως ἄμεινον εἰδέναι· σύνεστι γὰρ καὶ οὗτος Ἡλίῳ καὶ ἐπικοινωνεῖ\r\nδιὰ τὴν(691) ἁπλότητα τῶν νοήσεων καὶ τὸ μόνιμον τῆς οὐσίας καὶ κατὰ ταὐτὰ\r\nὂν τῆς ἐνεργείας.(692)\r\n\r\n(First, then, of his powers is that through which he reveals the whole\r\nintellectual substance throughout as one, since he brings together its\r\nextremes. For even as in the world of sense‐perception we can clearly\r\ndiscern air and water set between fire and earth,(693) as the link that\r\nbinds together the extremes, would one not reasonably suppose that, in the\r\ncase of the cause which is separate from elements and prior to them—and\r\nthough it is the principle of generation, is not itself generation—it is\r\nso ordered that, in that world also, the extreme causes which are wholly\r\nseparate from elements are bound together into one through certain modes\r\nof mediation, by King Helios, and are united about him as their centre?\r\nAnd the creative power of Zeus also coincides with him, by reason of which\r\nin Cyprus, as I said earlier, shrines are founded and assigned to them in\r\ncommon. And Apollo himself also we called to witness to our statements,\r\nsince it is certainly likely that he knows better than we about his own\r\nnature. For he too abides with Helios and is his colleague by reason of\r\nthe singleness of his thoughts and the stability of his substance and the\r\nconsistency of his activity.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ καὶ τὴν Διονύσου μεριστὴν δημιουργίαν οὐδαμοῦ φαίνεται χωρίζων ὁ θεὸς\r\nἩλίου· τούτῳ δὲ αὐτὴν ὑποτάττων ἀεὶ καὶ ἀποφαίνων σύνθρονον ἐξηγητὴς ἡμῖν\r\nἐστι τῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ θεοῦ καλλίστων διανοημάτων.

And since he always subordinates it\r\nto Helios and so indicates that Dionysus(695) is his partner on the\r\nthrone, Apollo is the interpreter for us of the fairest purposes that are\r\nto be found with our god. Further Helios, since he comprehends in himself\r\nall the principles of the fairest intellectual synthesis, is himself\r\nApollo the leader of the Muses. And since he fills the whole of our life\r\nwith fair order, he begat Asclepios(696) in the world, though even before\r\nthe beginning of the world he had him by his side.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ πολλὰς μὲν ἄν τις καὶ ἄλλας περὶ τὸν θεὸν τόνδε δυνάμεις θεωρῶν\r\nοὔποτ᾽ ἂν ἐφίκοιτο πασῶν· ἀπόχρη δὲ τῆς μὲν χωριστῆς καὶ πρὸ τῶν σωμάτων\r\nἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν οἶμαι τῶν αἰτιῶν, αἳ κεχωρισμέναι τῆς φανερᾶς προϋπάρχουσι\r\nδημιουργίας, ἴσην Ἡλίῳ [C] καὶ Διὶ τὴν δυναστείαν καὶ μίαν ὑπάρχουσαν\r\nτεθεωρηκέναι, τὴν δὲ ἁπλότητα τῶν νοήσεων μετὰ τοῦ διαιωνίου καὶ κατὰ\r\nταὐτὰ μονίμου ξὺν Ἀπόλλωνι τεθεαμένοις, τὸ δὲ μεριστὸν τῆς δημιουργίας\r\nμετὰ τοῦ τὴν μεριστὴν ἐπιτροπεύοντος οὐσίαν Διονύσου, τὸ δὲ τῆς καλλίστης\r\nσυμμετρίας καὶ νοερᾶς κράσεως περὶ τὴν τοῦ Μουσηγέτου δύναμιν τεθεωρηκόσι,\r\nτὸ συμπληροῦν δὲ τὴν εὐταξίαν τῆς ὅλης ζωῆς ξὺν Ἀσκληπιῳ νοοῦσι.\r\n\r\n(But though one should survey many other powers that belong to this god,\r\nnever could one investigate them all. It is enough to have observed the\r\nfollowing: That there is an equal and identical dominion of Helios and\r\nZeus over the separate creation which is prior to substances, in the\r\nregion, that is to say, of the absolute causes which, separated from\r\nvisible creation, existed prior to it; secondly we observed the singleness\r\nof his thoughts which is bound up with the imperishableness and abiding\r\nsameness that he shares with Apollo; thirdly, the dividing part of his\r\ncreative function which he shares with Dionysus who controls divided\r\nsubstance; fourthly we have observed the power of the leader of the Muses,\r\nrevealed in fairest symmetry and blending of the intellectual; finally we\r\ncomprehended that Helios, with Asclepios, fulfils the fair order of the\r\nwhole of life.)\r\n\r\n[D] Τοσαῦτα μὲν ὑπὲρ τῶν προκοσμίων αὐτοῦ δυνάμεων, ἔργα δὲ ὁμοταγῆ\r\nταύταις ὑπὲρ τὸν ἐμφανῆ κόσμον ἡ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἀποπλήρωσις. ἐπειδὴ γάρ ἐστι\r\nγνήσιος ἔκγονος(697) τἀγαθοῦ, παραδεξάμενος παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ τελείαν τὴν ἀγαθὴν\r\nμοῖραν, αὐτὸς ἅπασι τοῖς νοεροῖς διανέμει θεοῖς, ἀγαθοεργὸν καὶ τελείαν\r\nαὐτοῖς διδοὺς τὴν οὐσίαν. ἓν μὲν δὴ τουτί. δεύτερον δὲ ἔργον ἐστὶ τοῦ θεοῦ\r\nἡ τοῦ νοητοῦ κάλλους [145] ἐν τοῖς νοεροῖς καὶ ἀσωμάτοις εἴδεσι τελειοτάτη\r\nδιανομή. τῆς γὰρ ἐν τῇ φύσει φαινομένης οὐσίας γονίμου γεννᾶν ἐφιεμένης ἐν\r\nτῷ καλῷ καὶ ὑπεκτίθεσθαι τὸν τόκον, ἔτι ἀνάγκη προηγεῖσθαι τὴν ἐν τῷ νοητῷ\r\nκάλλει τοῦτο αὐτὸ διαιωνίως καὶ ἀεὶ ποιοῦσαν, ἀλλ᾽ οὐχὶ νῦν μὲν, εἰσαῦθις\r\nδὲ οὔ, καὶ ποτὲ μὲν γεννῶσαν, αὖθις δὲ ἄγονον. ὅσα γὰρ ἐνταῦθα ποτὲ καλά,\r\nταῦτα ἐν τοῖς νοητοῖς ἀεί. ῥητέον τοίνυν αὐτοῦ τῆς ἐν τοῖς φαινομένοις\r\nαἰτίας [B] γονίμου προκαθηγεῖσθαι τὸν ἐν τῷ νοερῷ καὶ διαιωνίῳ κάλλει\r\nτόκον ἀγέννητον, ὃν ὁ θεὸς οὗτος ἔχει περὶ ἑαυτὸν ὑποστήσας, ᾧ καὶ τὸν\r\nτέλειον νοῦν διανέμει, καθάπερ ὄμμασιν ἐνδιδοὺς διὰ τοῦ φωτὸς τὴν ὄψιν,\r\nοὕτω δὲ καὶ ἐν τοῖς νοητοῖς(698) διὰ τοῦ νοεροῦ παραδείγματος, ὃ προτείνει\r\nπολὺ φανότερον τῆς αἰθερίας αὐγῆς, πᾶσιν οἶμαι τοῖς νοεροῖς τὸ νοεῖν καὶ\r\nτὸ νοεῖσθαι παρέχει. ἑτέρα πρὸς ταύταις [C] ἐνέργεια θαυμαστὴ φαίνεται\r\nπερὶ τὸν βασιλέα τῶν ὅλων Ἥλιον ἡ τοῖς κρείττοσι γένεσιν ἐνδιδομένη μοῖρα\r\nβελτῖων, ἀγγέλοις,(699) δαίμοσιν, ἥρωσι ψυχαῖς τε μερισταῖς, ὁπόσαι\r\nμένουσιν ἐν παραδείγματος καὶ ἰδέας λόγῳ, μήποτε ἑαυτὰς διδοῦσαι σώματι.\r\nτὴν μὲν οὖν προκόσμιον οὐσίαν τοῦ θεοῦ δυνάμεις τε αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔργα τὸν\r\nβασιλέα τῶν ὅλων ὑμνοῦντες Ἥλιον, ἐφ᾽ ὅσον ἡμῖν [D] οἷόν τε ἦν ἐφικέσθαι\r\nτῆς περὶ αὐτὸν εὐφημίας σπεύδοντες, διεληλύθαμεν. ἐπεὶ δὲ ὄμματα, φησίν,\r\nἀκοῆς ἐστι πιστότερα, καίτοι τῆς νοήσεως ὄντα γε ἀπιστότερα καὶ\r\nἀσθενέστερα, φέρε καὶ περὶ τῆς ἐμφανοῦς αὐτοῦ δημιουργίας αἰτησάμενοι παρ᾽\r\nαὐτοῦ τὸ μετρίως εἰπεῖν πειραθῶμεν.\r\n\r\n(So much then in respect to those powers of his that existed before the\r\nbeginning of the world; and co‐ordinate with these are his works over the\r\nwhole visible world, in that he fills it with good gifts. For since he is\r\nthe genuine son of the Good and from it has received his blessed lot in\r\nfulness of perfection, he himself distributes that blessedness to the\r\nintellectual gods, bestowing on them a beneficent and perfect nature. This\r\nthen is one of his works. And a second work of the god is his most perfect\r\ndistribution of intelligible beauty among the intellectual and immaterial\r\nforms. For when the generative substance(700) which is visible in our\r\nworld desires to beget in the Beautiful(701) and to bring forth offspring,\r\nit is further necessary that it should be guided by the substance that, in\r\nthe region of intelligible beauty, does this very thing eternally and\r\nalways and not intermittently, now fruitful now barren. For all that is\r\nbeautiful in our world only at times, is beautiful always in the\r\nintelligible world. We must therefore assert that the ungenerated\r\noffspring in beauty intelligible and eternal guides the generative cause\r\nin the visible world; which offspring(702) this god(703) called into\r\nexistence and keeps at his side, and to it he assigns also perfect reason.\r\nFor just as through his light he gives sight to our eyes, so also among\r\nthe intelligible gods through his intellectual counterpart—which he causes\r\nto shine far more brightly than his rays in our upper air—he bestows, as I\r\nbelieve, on all the intellectual gods the faculty of thought and of being\r\ncomprehended by thought. Besides these, another marvellous activity of\r\nHelios the King of the All is that by which he endows with superior lot\r\nthe nobler races—I mean angels, daemons,(704) heroes, and those divided\r\nsouls(705) which remain in the category of model and archetype and never\r\ngive themselves over to bodies. I have now described the substance of our\r\ngod that is prior to the world and his powers and activities, celebrating\r\nHelios the King of the All in so far as it was possible for me to compass\r\nhis praise. But since eyes, as the saying goes, are more trustworthy than\r\nhearing—although they are of course less trustworthy and weaker than the\r\nintelligence—come, let me endeavour to tell also of his visible creative\r\nfunction; but let first me entreat him to grant that I speak with some\r\nmeasure of success.)\r\n\r\nὝπέστη μὲν οὖν περὶ αὐτὸν ὁ φαινόμενος ἐξ αἰῶνος κόσμος, ἕδραν δὲ ἔχει τὸ\r\nπερικόσμιον φῆς ἐξ αἰῶνος, οὐχὶ νῦν μέν, τότε δὲ οὔ, οὐδὲ ἄλλοτε ἄλλως,\r\nἀεὶ δὲ ὡσαύτως. ἀλλ᾽ εἴ τις ταύτην τὴν διαιώνιον φύσιν ἄχρις ἐπινοίας\r\nἐθελήσειε χρονικῶς κατανοῆσαι, [146] τὸν βασιλέα τῶν ὅλων Ἥλιον ἀθρόως\r\nκαταλάμποντα ῥᾷστα ἂν γνοίη, πόσων αἴτιός ἐστι δι᾽ αἰῶνος ἀγαθῶν τῷ κόσμῳ.\r\nοἶδα μὲν οὗν καὶ Πλάτωνα τὸν μέγαν καὶ μετὰ τοῦτον ἄνδρα τοῖς χρόνοις,\r\nοὔτι μὴν τῇ φύσει καταδεέστερον· τὸν Χαλκιδέα φημί, τὸν Ἰάμβλιχον· ὃς ἡμᾶς\r\nτά τε ἄλλα περὶ τὴν φιλοσοφίαν καὶ δὴ καὶ ταῦτα διὰ τῶν λόγων ἐμύησεν,\r\nἄχρις ὑποθέσεως τῷ γεννητῷ προσχρωμένους καὶ οἱονεὶ χρονικήν τινα [B] τὴν\r\nποίησιν ὑποτιθεμένους, ἵνα τὸ μέγεθος τῶν παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ γινομένων ἔργων\r\nἐπινοηθείη. πλὴν ἀλλ᾽ ἔμοιγε τῆς ἐκείνων ἀπολειπομένῳ παντάπασι δυνάμεως\r\nοὐδαμῶς ἐστι παρακινδυνευτέον, ἐπείπερ ἀκίνδυνον οὐδὲ αὐτὸ τὸ μέχρι ψιλῆς\r\nὑποθέσεως χρονικήν τινα περὶ τὸν κόσμον ὑποθέσθαι ποίησιν ὁ κλεινὸς ἤρως\r\nἐνόμισεν Ἰάμβλιχος. πλὴν ἀλλ᾽ ἐπείπερ ὁ θεὸς ἐξ αἰωνίου προῆλθεν αἰτίας,\r\nμᾶλλον δὲ προήγαγε πάντα ἐξ αἰῶνος, [C] ἀπὸ τῶν ἀφανῶν τὰ φανερὰ βουλήσει\r\nθείᾳ καὶ ἀρρήτῳ τάχει καὶ ἀνυπερβλήτῳ δυνάμει πάντα ἀθρόως ἐν τῷ νῦν\r\nἀπογεννήσας χρόνῳ, ἀπεκληρώσατο μὲν οἷον οἰκειοτέραν ἕδραν τὸ μέσον\r\nοὐρανοῦ, ἵνα πανταχόθεν ἴσα διανέμῃ τἀγαθὰ τοῖς ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ\r\nπροελθοῦσι θεοῖς, ἐπιτροπεύῃ δὲ τὰς ἑπτὰ καὶ τὴν ὀγδόην οὐρανοῦ\r\nκυκλοφορίαν, ἐνάτην τε οἶμαι δημιουργίαν τὴν ἐν γενέσει καὶ φθορᾷ συνεχεῖ\r\nδιαιωνίως ἀνακυκλουμένην γένεσιν. οἵ τε γὰρ πλάνητες εὔδηλον ὅτι περὶ [D]\r\nαὐτὸν χορεύοντες μέτρον ἔχουσι τῆς κινήσεως τὴν πρὸς τὸν θεὸν τόνδε\r\nτοιάνδε περὶ τὰ σχήματα συμφωνίαν, ὅ τε ὅλος οὐρανὸς αὐτῷ κατὰ πάντα\r\nσυναρμοζόμενος ἑαυτοῦ τὰ μέρη θεῶν ἐστιν ἐξ Ἡλίου πλήρης. ἔστι γὰρ ὁ θεὸς\r\nὅδε πέντε μὲν κύκλων ἄρχων κατ᾽ οὐρανόν, τρεῖς δὲ ἐκ τούτων ἐπιὼν ἐν τρισὶ\r\nτρεῖς γεννᾷ τὰς χάριτας· οἱ λειπόμενοι δὲ μεγάλης ἀνάγκης εἰσὶ πλάστιγγες.\r\n[147] ἀξύνετον ἴσως λέγω τοῖς Ἕλλησιν, ὥσπερ δέον μόνον τὰ συνήθη καὶ\r\nγνώριμα λέγειν· οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ τοῦτό ἐστιν, ὡς ἄν τις ὑπολάβοι, παντελῶς\r\nξένον. οἱ Διόσκουροι τίνες ὑμῖν εἰσιν, ὦ σοφώτατοι καὶ ἀβασανίστως τὰ\r\nπολλὰ παραδεχόμενοι; οὐχ ἑτερήμεροι(706) λέγονται, διότι μὴ θέμις ὁρᾶσθαι\r\nτῆς αὐτῆς ἡμέρας; ὑμεῖς ὅπως ἀκούετε εὔδηλον ὅτι τῆς χθὲς καὶ τήμερον.\r\nεἶτα τί νοεῖ τοῦτο, πρὸς αὐτῶν τῶν Διοσκούρων; ἐφαρμόσωμεν αὐτὸ φύσει τινὶ\r\nκαὶ πράγματι, κενὸν(707) [B] ἵνα μηδὲν μηδὲ ἀνόητον λέγωμεν. ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ ἂν\r\nεὕροιμεν ἀκριβῶς ἐξετάζοντες· οὐδὲ γὰρ ὡς ὑπέλαβον εἰρῆσθαί τινες πρὸς τῶν\r\nθεολόγων ἡμισφαίρια τοῦ παντὸς τὰ δύο λόγον ἔχει τινά· πῶς γάρ ἐστιν\r\nἑτερήμερον αὐτῶν ἕκαστον οὐδὲ ἐπινοῆσαι ῥᾴδιον, ἡμέρας ἑκάστης\r\nἀνεπαισθήτου τῆς κατὰ τὸν φωτισμὸν αὐτῶν παραυξήσεως γινομένης. σκεψώμεθα\r\nδὲ νῦν ὑπὲρ ὧν αὐτοὶ καινοτομεῖν ἴσως τῳ δοκοῦμεν. τῆς αὐτῆς ἡμέρας\r\nἐκεῖνοι [C] μετέχειν ὀρθῶς ἂν ῥηθεῖεν, ὁπόσοις ἴσος ἐστὶν ὁ τῆς ὑπὲρ γῆν\r\nἡλίου πορείας χρόνος ἐν ἑνὶ καὶ τῷ αὐτῷ μηνί. ὁράτω τις οὖν, εἰ μὴ τὸ\r\nἑτερήμερον τοῖς κύκλοις ἐφαρμόζει τοῖς τε ἄλλοις καὶ τοῖς τροπικοῖς.\r\nὑπολήψεται τις· οὐκ ἴσον ἐστιν. οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἀεὶ φαίνονται, καὶ τοῖς τὴν\r\nἀντίσκιον οἰκοῦσι γῆν ἀμφοτέροις ἀμφότεροι, τῶν δὲ οἱ θάτερον ὁρῶντες\r\nοὐδαμῶς ὁρῶσι θάτερον.\r\n\r\n(From eternity there subsisted, surrounding Helios, the visible world, and\r\nfrom eternity the light that encompasses the world has its fixed station,\r\nnot shining intermittently, nor in different ways at different times, but\r\nalways in the same manner. And if one desired to comprehend, as far as the\r\nmind may, this eternal nature from the point of view of time, one would\r\nunderstand most easily of how many blessings for the world throughout\r\neternity he is the cause, even Helios the King of the All who shines\r\nwithout cessation. Now I am aware that the great philosopher Plato,(708)\r\nand after him a man who, though he is later in time, is by no means\r\ninferior to him in genius—I mean Iamblichus(709) of Chalcis, who through\r\nhis writings initiated me not only into other philosophic doctrines but\r\nthese also—I am aware, I say, that they employed as a hypothesis the\r\nconception of a generated world, and assumed for it, so to speak, a\r\ncreation in time in order that the magnitude of the works that arise from\r\nHelios might be recognised. But apart from the fact that I fall short\r\naltogether of their ability, I must by no means be so rash; especially\r\nsince the glorious hero Iamblichus thought it was not without risk to\r\nassume, even as a bare hypothesis, a temporal limit for the creation of\r\nthe world. Nay rather, the god came forth from an eternal cause, or rather\r\nbrought forth all things from everlasting, engendering by his divine will\r\nand with untold speed and unsurpassed power, from the invisible all things\r\nnow visible in present time. And then he assigned as his own station the\r\nmid‐heavens, in order that from all sides he may bestow equal blessings on\r\nthe gods who came forth by his agency and in company with him; and that he\r\nmay guide the seven spheres(710) in the heavens and the eighth sphere(711)\r\nalso, yes and as I believe the ninth creation too, namely our world which\r\nrevolves for ever in a continuous cycle of birth and death. For it is\r\nevident that the planets, as they dance in a circle about him, preserve as\r\nthe measure of their motion a harmony between this god and their own\r\nmovements such as I shall now describe; and that the whole heaven also,\r\nwhich adapts itself to him in all its parts, is full of gods who proceed\r\nfrom Helios. For this god is lord of five zones in the heavens; and when\r\nhe traverses three of these he begets in those three the three\r\nGraces.(712) And the remaining zones are the scales of mighty\r\nNecessity.(713) To the Greeks what I say is perhaps incomprehensible—as\r\nthough one were obliged to say to them only what is known and familiar.\r\nYet not even is this altogether strange to them as one might suppose. For\r\nwho, then, in your opinion, are the Dioscuri,(714) O ye most wise, ye who\r\naccept without question so many of your traditions? Do you not call them\r\n“alternate of days,” because they may not both be seen on the same day? It\r\nis obvious that by this you mean “yesterday” and “to‐day.” But what does\r\nthis mean, in the name of those same Dioscuri? Let me apply it to some\r\nnatural object, so that I may not say anything empty and senseless. But no\r\nsuch object could one find, however carefully one might search for it. For\r\nthe theory that some have supposed to be held by the theogonists, that the\r\ntwo hemispheres of the universe are meant, has no meaning. For how one\r\ncould call each one of the hemispheres “alternate of days” is not easy to\r\nimagine, since the increase of their light in each separate day is\r\nimperceptible. But now let us consider a question on which some may think\r\nthat I am innovating. We say correctly that those persons for whom the\r\ntime of the sun’s course above the earth is the same in one and the same\r\nmonth share the same day. Consider therefore whether the expression\r\n“alternate of days” cannot be applied both to the tropics and the other,\r\nthe polar, circles. But some one will object that it does not apply\r\nequally to both. For though the former are always visible, and both of\r\nthem are visible at once to those who inhabit that part of the earth where\r\nshadows are cast in an opposite direction,(715) yet in the case of the\r\nlatter those who see the one do not see the other.)\r\n\r\n[D] Ἀλλ᾽ ἵνα μὴ πλείω περὶ τῶν αὐτῶν λέγων διατρίβω, τὰς τροπὰς\r\nἐργαζόμενος, ὥσπερ ἴσμεν, πατὴρ ὡρῶν ἐστιν, οὐκ ἀπολείπων δὲ οὐδαμῶς τοὺς\r\nπόλους Ὠκεανὸς ἂν εἴη, διπλῆς ἡγεμὼν οὐσίας. μῶν ἀσαφές τι καὶ τοῦτο\r\nλέγομεν, ἐπείπερ πρὸ ἡμῶν αὐτὸ καὶ Ὅμηρος ἔφη·\r\n\r\nHowever, not to dwell too long on the same subject; since he causes the\r\nwinter and summer solstice, Helios is, as we know, the father of the\r\nseasons; and since he never forsakes the poles, he is Oceanus, the lord of\r\ntwo‐fold substance. My meaning here is not obscure, is it, seeing that\r\nbefore my time Homer said the same thing?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ὠκεανοῦ, ὅσπερ γένεσις πάντεσσι τέτυκται,(716)\r\n\r\n    (“Oceanus who is the father of all things”)\r\n\r\n\r\nθνητῶν τε θεῶν θ᾽, ὡς ἂν αὐτὸς φαίη, μακάρων; ἀληθῶς.

For there is no single thing in the whole of\r\nexistence that is not the offspring of the substance of Oceanus. But what\r\nhas that to do with the poles? Shall I tell you? It were better indeed to\r\nkeep silence(717); but for all that I will speak.)\r\n\r\nΛέγεται γοῦν, εἰ καὶ μὴ πάντες ἑτοίμως ἀποδέχονται, ὁ δίσκος ἐπὶ τῆς\r\nἀνάστρου φέρεσθαι πολὺ τῆς ἀπλανοῦς ὑψηλότερος· καὶ οὕτω δὴ(718) τῶν μὲν\r\nπλανωμένων οὐχ ἕξει τὸ μέσον, τριῶν δὲ τῶν κόσμων κατὰ τὰς τελεστικὰς [B]\r\nὑποθέσεις, εἰ χρὴ τὰ τοιαῦτα καλεῖν ὑποθέσεις, ἀλλὰ μὴ ταῦτα μὲν δόγματα,\r\nτὰ δὲ τῶν σφαιρικῶν ὑποθέσεις. οἱ μὲν γὰρ θεῶν ἢ δαιμόνων μεγάλων δή τινων\r\nἀκούσαντές φασιν, οἱ δὲ ὑποτίθενται τὸ πιθανὸν ἐκ τῆς πρὸς τὰ φαινόμενα\r\nσυμφωνίας. αἰνεῖν μὲν οὖν ἄξιον καὶ τούσδε, πιστεύειν δὲ ἐκείνοις ὅτῳ\r\nβέλτιον εἶναι δοκεῖ, τοῦτον ἐγὼ παίζων καὶ σπουδάζων ἄγαμαί τε καὶ\r\nτεθαύμακα. καὶ ταῦτα μὲν δὴ ταύτῃ, φασί.\r\n\r\n(Some say then, even though all men are not ready to believe it, that the\r\nsun travels in the starless heavens far above the region of the fixed\r\nstars. And on this theory he will not be stationed midmost among the\r\nplanets but midway between the three worlds: that is, according to the\r\nhypothesis of the mysteries, if indeed one ought to use the word\r\n“hypothesis” and not rather say “established truths,” using the word\r\n“hypothesis” for the study of the heavenly bodies. For the priests of the\r\nmysteries tell us what they have been taught by the gods or mighty\r\ndaemons, whereas the astronomers make plausible hypotheses from the\r\nharmony that they observe in the visible spheres. It is proper, no doubt,\r\nto approve the astronomers as well, but where any man thinks it better to\r\nbelieve the priests of the mysteries, him I admire and revere, both in\r\njest and earnest. And so much for that, as the saying is.(719))\r\n\r\n[C] Πολὺ δὲ πρὸς οἷς ἔφην πλῆθός ἐστι περὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν θεῶν, οὓς\r\nκατενόησαν οἱ τὸν οὐρανὸν μὴ παρέργως μηδὲ ὥσπερ τὰ βοσκήματα\r\nθεωροῦντες.(720) τοὺς τρεῖς γὰρ τετραχῇ τέμνων διὰ τῆς τοῦ ζῳοφόρου κύκλου\r\nπρὸς ἕκαστον αὐτῶν κοινωνίας τοῦτον αὖθις τὸν ζῳοφόρον εἰς δώδεκα θεῶν\r\nδυνάμεις διαιρεῖ, καὶ μέντοι τούτων ἕκαστον εἰς τρεῖς, ὥστε ποιεῖν ἓξ ἐπὶ\r\nτοῖς τριάκοντα. ἔνθεν οἶμαι καθήκει ἄνωθεν ἡμῖν ἐξ οὐρανῶν [D] τριπλῆ\r\nχαρίτων δόσις, ἐκ τῶν κύκλων, οὗς ὁ θεὸς ὅδε τετραχῇ τέμνων τὴν τετραπλῆν\r\nἐπιπέμπει τῶν ὡρῶν ἀγλαΐαν, αἳ δὴ τὰς τροπὰς ἔχουσι τῶν καιρῶν. κύκλον τοι\r\nκαὶ αἱ Χάριτες ἐπὶ γῆς διὰ τῶν ἀγαλμάτων μιμοῦνται. χαριτοδότης(721) δέ\r\nἐστιν ὁ Διόνυσος ἐς ταὐτὸ λεγόμενος Ἡλίῳ συμβασιλεύειν. τύ οὖν ἔτι σοι τὸν\r\nὯρον λέγω καὶ τἇλλα θεῶν ὀνόματα, τὰ πάντα Ἡλίῳ προσήκοντα; συνῆκαν γὰρ\r\nἅνθρωποι τὸν θεὸν ἐξ ὧν ὁ θεὸς [149] ὅδε ἐργάζεται, τὸν σύμπαντα οὐρανὸν\r\nτοῖς νοεροῖς ἀγαθοῖς τελειωσάμενος καὶ μεταδοὺς αὐτῷ τοῦ νοητοῦ κάλλους,\r\nἀρξάμενοί τε ἐκεῖθεν ὅλον τε αὐτὸν καὶ τὰ μέρη τῇ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἁδρᾷ(722)\r\nδόσει. πᾶσαν γὰρ ἐπιτροπεύει(723) κίνησιν ἄχρι τῆς τελευταίας τοῦ κόσμου\r\nλ\\ηξεως· φύσιν τε καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ πᾶν ὅ,τι ποτέ ἐστι, πάντα πανταχοῦ\r\nτελειοῦται. τὴν δὲ τοσαύτην στρατιὰν τῶν θεῶν εἰς μίαν ἡγεμονικὴν [B]\r\nἕνωσιν συντάξας Ἀθηνᾷ Προνοίᾳ παρέδωκεν, ἣν ὁ μὲν μῦθός φησιν ἐκ τῆς τοῦ\r\nΔιὸς γενέσθαι κορυφῆς, ἡμεῖς δὲ ὅλην ἐξ ὅλου τοῦ βασιλέως Ἡλίου\r\nπροβληθῆναι συνεχομένην ἐν αὐτῷ, ταύτῃ διαφέροντες τοῦ μύθου, ὅτι μὴ ἐκ\r\nτοῦ ἀκροτάτου μέρους, ὅλην δὲ ἐξ ὅλου· ἐπεὶ τἆλλά γε οὐδὲν διαφέρειν Ἡλίου\r\nΔία νομίζοντες ὁμολογοῦμεν τῇ παλαιᾷ φήμῃ. καὶ τοῦτο δὲ αὐτὸ Πρόνοιαν\r\nἈθηνᾶν λέγοντες οὐ καινοτομοῦμεν, εἴπερ ὀρθῶς ἀκούομεν·\r\n\r\n(Now besides those whom I have mentioned, there is in the heavens a great\r\nmultitude of gods who have been recognised as such by those who survey the\r\nheavens, not casually, nor like cattle. For as he divides the three\r\nspheres by four through the zodiac,(724) which is associated with every\r\none of the three, so he divides the zodiac also into twelve divine powers;\r\nand again he divides every one of these twelve by three, so as to make\r\nthirty‐six gods in(725) all. Hence, as I believe, there descends from\r\nabove, from the heavens to us, a three‐fold gift of the Graces: I mean\r\nfrom the spheres, for this god, by thus dividing them by four, sends to us\r\nthe fourfold glory of the seasons, which express the changes of time. And\r\nindeed on our earth the Graces imitate a circle(726) in their statues. And\r\nit is Dionysus who is the giver of the Graces, and in this very connection\r\nhe is said to reign with Helios. Why should I go on to speak to you of\r\nHorus(727) and of the other names of gods, which all belong to Helios? For\r\nfrom his works men have learned to know this god, who makes the whole\r\nheavens perfect through the gift of intellectual blessings, and gives it a\r\nshare of intelligible beauty; and taking the heavens as their starting‐\r\npoint, they have learned to know him both as a whole and his parts also,\r\nfrom his abundant bestowal of good gifts. For he exercises control over\r\nall movement, even to the lowest plane of the universe. And everywhere he\r\nmakes all things perfect, nature and soul and everything that exists. And\r\nmarshalling together this great army of the gods into a single commanding\r\nunity, he handed it over to Athene Pronoia(728) who, as the legend says,\r\nsprang from the head of Zeus, but I say that she was sent forth from\r\nHelios whole from the whole of him, being contained within him; though I\r\ndisagree with the legend only so far as I assert that she came forth not\r\nfrom his highest part, but whole from the whole of him. For in other\r\nrespects, since I believe that Zeus is in no wise different from Helios, I\r\nagree with that ancient tradition. And in using this very phrase Athene\r\nPronoia, I am not innovating, if I rightly understand the words:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἵκετο δ᾽ ἐς Πυθῶνα καὶ ἐς Γλαυκῶπα Προνοίην.\r\n\r\n    (“He came to Pytho and to grey‐eyed Pronoia.”(729))\r\n\r\n\r\n[C] οὕτως ἄρα καὶ τοῖς παλαιοῖς ἐφαίνετο Ἀθηνᾶ Πρόνοια σύνθρονος Ἀπόλλωνι\r\nτῷ νομιζομένῳ μηδὲν Ἡλίου διαφέρειν. μή ποτε οὖν καὶ θείᾳ μοίρᾳ τοῦτο\r\nὍμηρος· ἦν γάρ, ὡς εἰκός, θεόληπτος· ἀπεμαντεύσατο πολλαχοῦ τῆς ποιήσεως·\r\n\r\n(This proves that the ancients also thought that Athene Pronoia shared the\r\nthrone of Apollo, who, as we believe, differs in no way from Helios.\r\nIndeed, did not Homer by divine inspiration—for he was, we may suppose,\r\npossessed by a god—reveal this truth, when he says often in his poems:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Τιοίμην δ᾽ ὡς τίετ᾽ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἀπόλλων,(730)\r\n\r\n    (“May I be honoured even as Athene and Apollo were honoured”)\r\n\r\n\r\nὑπὸ Διὸς δήπουθεν, ὅσπερ ἐστὶν ὁ αὐτὸς Ἡλίῳ; καθάπερ δ᾽(731) ὁ βασιλεὺς\r\nἈπόλλων ἐπικοινωνεῖ διὰ τῆς ἁπλότητος τῶν νοήσεων Ἡλίῳ, οὕτω δὲ καὶ τὴν\r\nἈθηνᾶν [D] νομιστέον ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ παραδεξαμένην τὴν οὐσίαν οὖσάν τε αὐτοῦ\r\nτελείαν νόησιν συνάπτειν μὲν τοὺς περὶ τὸν Ἥλιον θεοὺς αὖ τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν\r\nὅλων Ἡλίῳ δίχα συγχύσεως εἰς ἕνωσιν, αὐτὴν δὲ τὴν ἄχραντον καὶ καθαρὰν\r\nζωὴν ἁπ᾽ ἅκρας ἁψῖδος οὐρανοῦ διὰ τῶν ἑπτὰ κύκλων ἄχρι τῆς Σελήνης [150]\r\nνέμουσαν ἐποχετεύειν, ἣν ἡ θεὸς ἥδε τῶν κυκλικῶν οὖσαν σωμάτων ἐσχάτην\r\nἐπλήρωσε τῆς φρονήσεως, ὑφ᾽ ἧς ἡ Σελήνη τά τε ὑπὲρ τὸν οὐρανὸν θεωρεῖ\r\nνοητὰ καὶ τὰ ὑφ᾽ ἑαυτὴν κοσμοῦσα τὴν ὕλην τοῖς εἴδεσιν ἀναιρεῖ τὸ θηριῶδες\r\nαὐτῆς καὶ ταραχῶδες καὶ ἄτακτον. ἀνθρώποις δὲ ἀγαθὰ δίδωσιν Ἀθηνᾶ σοφίαν\r\nτό(732) τε νοεῖν καὶ τὰς δημιουργικὰς τέχνας. κατοικεῖ δὲ τὰς ἀκροπόλεις\r\nαὕτη δήπουθεν καταστησαμένη τὴν πολιτικὴν διὰ σοφίας κοινωνίαν.

And just as King\r\nApollo, through the singleness of his thoughts, is associated with Helios,\r\nso also we must believe that Athene(735) has received her nature from\r\nHelios, and that she is his intelligence in perfect form: and so she binds\r\ntogether the gods who are assembled about Helios and brings them without\r\nconfusion into unity with Helios, the King of the All: and she distributes\r\nand is the channel for stainless and pure life throughout the seven\r\nspheres, from the highest vault of the heavens as far as Selene the\r\nMoon:(736) for Selene is the last of the heavenly spheres which Athene\r\nfills with wisdom: and by her aid Selene beholds the intelligible which is\r\nhigher than the heavens, and adorns with its forms the realm of matter\r\nthat lies below her, and thus she does away with its savagery and\r\nconfusion and disorder. Moreover to mankind Athene gives the blessings of\r\nwisdom and intelligence and the creative arts. And surely she dwells in\r\nthe capitols of cities because, through her wisdom, she has established\r\nthe community of the state. I have still to say a few words about\r\nAphrodite, who, as the wise men among the Phoenicians affirm, and as I\r\nbelieve, assists Helios in his creative function. She is, in very truth, a\r\nsynthesis of the heavenly gods, and in their harmony she is the spirit of\r\nlove and unity.(737) For she(738) is very near to Helios, and when she\r\npursues the same course as he and approaches him, she fills the skies with\r\nfair weather and gives generative power to the earth: for she herself\r\ntakes thought for the continuous birth of living things. And though of\r\nthat continuous birth King Helios is the primary creative cause, yet\r\nAphrodite is the joint cause with him, she who enchants our souls with her\r\ncharm and sends down to earth from the upper air rays of light most sweet\r\nand stainless, aye, more lustrous than gold itself. I desire to mete out\r\nto you still more of the theology of the Phoenicians, and whether it be to\r\nsome purpose my argument as it proceeds will show. The inhabitants of\r\nEmesa,(739) a place from time immemorial sacred to Helios, associate with\r\nHelios in their temples Monimos and Azizos.(740) Iamblichus, from whom I\r\nhave taken this and all besides, a little from a great store, says that\r\nthe secret meaning to be interpreted is that Monimos is Hermes and Azizos\r\nAres, the assessors of Helios, who are the channel for many blessings to\r\nthe region of our earth.)\r\n\r\nΤὰ μὲν οὖν περὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν ἔργα τοῦ θεοῦ τοιαῦτά ἐστι, καὶ διὰ τούτων\r\nἐπιτελούμενα μέχρι τῶν τῆς γῆς προήκει τελευταίων ὅρων· ὅσα δὲ ὑπὸ τὴν\r\nΣελήνην ἐργάζεται, μακρὸν ἂν εἴη τὰ πάντα ἀπαριθμεῖσθαι. πλὴν ὡς ἐν\r\nκεφαλαίῳ καὶ ταῦτα ῥητέον. [151] οἶδα μὲν οὖν ἔγωγε καὶ πρότερον\r\nμνημονεύσας, ὁπηνίκα ἠξίουν ἐκ τῶν φαινομένων τὰ ἀφανῆ περὶ τῆς τοῦ θεοῦ\r\nσκοπεῖν οὐσίας, ὁ λόγος δὲ ἀπαιτεῖ με καὶ νῦν ἐν τάξει περὶ αὐτῶν δηλῶσαι.\r\n\r\n(Such then are the works of Helios in the heavens, and, when completed by\r\nmeans of the gods whom I have named, they reach even unto the furthest\r\nbounds of the earth. But to tell the number of all his works in the region\r\nbelow the moon would take too long. Nevertheless I must describe them also\r\nin a brief summary. Now I am aware that I mentioned them earlier when I\r\nclaimed(741) that from things visible we could observe the invisible\r\nproperties of the god’s substance, but the argument demands that I should\r\nexpound them now also, in their proper order.)\r\n\r\nΚαθάπερ οὖν ἐν τοῖς νοεροῖς ἔχειν ἔφαμεν τὴν ἡγεμονίαν Ἥλιον, πολὺ περὶ\r\nτὴν ἀμέριστον οὐσίαν ἑαυτοῦ πλῆθος ἑνοειδῶς ἔχοντα τῶν θεῶν, ἔτι δὲ ἐν\r\nτοῖς αἰσθητοῖς, [B] ἃ δὴ τὴν κύκλῳ διαιωνίαν πορεύεται μάλα εὐδαίμονα\r\nπορείαν, ἀπεδείκνυμεν ἀρχηγὸν καὶ κύριον, ἐνδιδόντα μὲν τὸ γόνιμον τῇ\r\nφύσει,(742) πληροῦντα δὲ τὸν ὅλον οὐρανὸν ὥσπερ τῆς φαινομένης αὐγῆς οὕτω\r\nδὲ καὶ μυρίων ἀγαθῶν ἀφανῶν ἄλλων, τελειούμενα δὲ ἐξ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ παρὰ τῶν\r\nἄλλων ἐμφανῶν θεῶν ἀγαθὰ χορηγούμενα, καὶ πρό γε τούτων αὐτοὺς ἐκείνους\r\nὑπὸ τῆς ἀπορρήτου καὶ θείας αὐτοῦ τελειουμένους ἐνεργείας· οὕτω δὲ καὶ\r\nπερὶ τὸν ἐν γενέσει τόπον θεούς τινας ἐπιβεβηκέναι νομιστέον [C] ὑπὸ τοῦ\r\nβασιλέως Ἡλίου συνεχομένουσ, οἳ τὴν τετραπλῆν τῶν στοιχείων κυβερνῶντες\r\nφύσιν, περὶ ἃς ἐστήρικται ταῦτα ψυχὰς μετὰ τῶν τριῶν κρειττόνων ἐνοικοῦσι\r\nγενῶν. αὐταῖς δὲ ταῖς μερισταῖς ψυχαῖς ὅσων ἀγαθῶν ἐστιν αἴτιος, κρίσιν τε\r\nαὐταῖς προτείνων καὶ δίκῃ κατευθύνων καὶ ἀποκαθαίρων λαμπρότητι; τὴν ὅλην\r\nδὲ οὐχ οὗτος φύσιν, ἐνδιδοὺς ἄνωθεν αὐτῇ τὸ γόνιμον, κινεῖ καὶ ἀναζωπυρεῖ;\r\nἀλλὰ καὶ ταῖς μερισταῖς φύσεσιν [D] οὐ τῆς εἰς τέλος πορείας οὗτος ἐστιν\r\nἀληθῶς αἴτιος; ἄνθρωπον γὰρ ὑπὸ ἀνθρώπου γεννᾶσθαί φησιν Ἀριστοτέλης καὶ\r\nἡλίου.(743) ταὐτὸν δὴ οὖν καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἁπάντων, ὅσα τῶν μεριστῶν ἐστι\r\nφύσεων ἔργα, περὶ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἡλίου προσήκει διανοεῖσθαι. τί δέ; οὐχ ἡμῖν\r\nὄμβρους καὶ ἀνέμους καὶ τὰ ἐν τοῖς μεταρσίοις γινόμενα τῷ διττῷ τῆς\r\nἀναθυμιάσεως οἷον ὕλῃ χρώμενος ὁ θεὸς οὗτος ἐργάζεται; [152] θερμαίνων γὰρ\r\nτὴν γῆν ἀτμίδα καὶ καπνὸν ἕλκει, γίνεται δὲ ἐκ τούτων οὐ τὰ μετάρσια\r\nμόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅσα ἐπὶ γῆς πάθη, σμικρὰ καὶ μεγάλα.\r\n\r\n(I said then that Helios holds sway among the intellectual gods in that he\r\nunites into one, about his own undivided substance, a great multitude of\r\nthe gods: and further, I demonstrated that among the gods whom we can\r\nperceive, who revolve eternally in their most blessed path, he is leader\r\nand lord; since he bestows on their nature its generative power, and fills\r\nthe whole heavens not only with visible rays of light but with countless\r\nother blessings that are invisible; and, further, that the blessings which\r\nare abundantly supplied by the other visible gods are made perfect by him,\r\nand that even prior to this the visible gods themselves are made perfect\r\nby his unspeakable and divine activity. In the same manner we must believe\r\nthat on this our world of generation certain gods have alighted who are\r\nlinked together with Helios: and these gods guide the four‐fold nature of\r\nthe elements, and inhabit, together with the three higher races,(744)\r\nthose souls which are upborne by the elements. But for the divided\r\nsouls(745) also, of how many blessings is he the cause! For he extends to\r\nthem the faculty of judging, and guides them with justice, and purifies\r\nthem by his brilliant light. Again, does he not set in motion the whole of\r\nnature and kindle life therein, by bestowing on it generative power from\r\non high? But for the divided natures also, is not he the cause that they\r\njourney to their appointed end?(746) For Aristotle says that man is\r\nbegotten by man and the sun together. Accordingly the same theory about\r\nKing Helios must surely apply to all the other activities of the divided\r\nsouls. Again, does he not produce for us rain and wind and the clouds in\r\nthe skies, by employing, as though it were matter, the two kinds of\r\nvapour? For when he heats the earth he draws up steam and smoke, and from\r\nthese there arise not only the clouds but also all the physical changes on\r\nour earth, both great and small.)\r\n\r\nΤί οὖν περὶ(747) τῶν αὐτῶν ἐπέξειμι μακρότερα, ἐξὸν ἐπὶ τὸ πέρας ἤδη\r\nβαδίζειν ὑμνήσαντα πρότερον ὅσα ἔδωκεν ἀνθρώποις Ἥλιος ἀγαθά; γινόμενοι\r\nγὰρ ἐξ αὐτοῦ τρεφόμεθα παρ᾽ ἐκείνου.

For from him are we born,\r\nand by him are we nourished. But his more divine gifts, and all that he\r\nbestows on our souls when he frees them from the body and then lifts them\r\nup on high to the region of those substances that are akin to the god; and\r\nthe fineness and vigour of his divine rays, which are assigned as a sort\r\nof vehicle for the safe descent of our souls into this world of\r\ngeneration; all this, I say, let others celebrate in fitting strains, but\r\nlet me believe it rather than demonstrate its truth. However, I need not\r\nhesitate to discuss so much as is known to all. Plato says that the sky is\r\nour instructor in wisdom. For from its contemplation we have learned to\r\nknow the nature of number, whose distinguishing characteristics we know\r\nonly from the course of the sun. Plato himself says that day and night\r\nwere created first.(750) And next, from observing the moon’s light, which\r\nwas bestowed on the goddess by Helios, we later progressed still further\r\nin the understanding of these matters: in every case conjecturing the\r\nharmony of all things with this god. For Plato himself says somewhere that\r\nour race was by nature doomed to toil, and so the gods pitied us and gave\r\nus Dionysus and the Muses as playfellows. And we recognised that Helios is\r\ntheir common lord, since he is celebrated as the father of Dionysus and\r\nthe leader of the Muses. And has not Apollo, who is his colleague in\r\nempire, set up oracles in every part of the earth, and given to men\r\ninspired wisdom, and regulated their cities by means of religious and\r\npolitical ordinances? And he has civilised the greater part of the world\r\nby means of Greek colonies, and so made it easier for the world to be\r\ngoverned by the Romans. For the Romans themselves not only belong to the\r\nGreek race, but also the sacred ordinances and the pious belief in the\r\ngods which they have established and maintain are, from beginning to end,\r\nGreek. And beside this they have established a constitution not inferior\r\nto that of any one of the best governed states, if indeed it be not\r\nsuperior to all others that have ever been put into practice. For which\r\nreason I myself recognise that our city is Greek, both in descent and as\r\nto its constitution.)\r\n\r\n[B] Τί ἔτι σοι λέγω, πῶς τῆς ὑγιείας καὶ σωτηρίας πάντων προυνόησε τὸν\r\nσωτῆρα τῶν ὅλων ἀπογεννήσας Ἀσκληπιόν, ὅπως δὲ ἀρετὴν ἔδωκε παντοίαν\r\nἈφροδίτην Ἀθηνᾷ συγκαταπέμψας ἡμῖν, κηδεμόνα μόνον οὐχὶ νόμον θέμενος,\r\nπρὸς μηδὲν ἕτερον χρῆσθαι τῇ μίξει ἢ πρὸς τὴν γέννησιν(751) τοῦ ὁμοίου;\r\nδιά τοι τοῦτο καὶ κατὰ τὰς περιόδους αὐτοῦ πάντα τὰ φυόμενα καὶ τὰ\r\nπαντοδαπῶν ζῴων φῦλα κινεῖται [C] πρὸς ἀπογέννησιν τοῦ ὁμοίου. τί χρὴ τὰς\r\nἀκτῖνας αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ φῶς σεμνῦναι; νὺξ γοῦν ἀσέληνός τε καὶ ἄναστρος ὅπως\r\nἐστὶ φοβερά, ἆρα ἐννοεῖ τις, ἵν᾽ ἐντεῦθεν, ὁπόσον ἔχομεν ἀγαθὸν ἐξ ἡλίου\r\nτὸ φῶς, τεκμήρηται; τοῦτο δὲ αὐτὸ συνεχὲς παρέχων καὶ ἀμεσολάβητον νυκτὶ\r\nἐν οἷς χρὴ τόποις ἀπὸ τῆς σελήνης τοῖς ἄνω, ἐκεχειρίαν ἡμῖν διὰ τῆς νυκτὸς\r\nτῶν πόνων δίδωσιν. οὐδὲν ἂν γένοιτο πέρας τοῦ λόγου, εἰ πάντα ἐπεξιέναι\r\n[D] τις ἐθελήσειε τὰ τοιαῦτα. ἓν γὰρ οὐδέν ἐστιν ἀγαθὸν κατὰ τὸν βίον, ὃ\r\nμὴ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦδε λαβόντες ἔχομεν, ἤτοι παρὰ μόνου τέλειον, ἢ διὰ τῶν\r\nἄλλων θεῶν παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ τελειούμενον.\r\n\r\n(Shall I now go on to tell you how Helios took thought for the health and\r\nsafety of all men by begetting Asclepios(752) to be the saviour of the\r\nwhole world? and how he bestowed on us every kind of excellence by sending\r\ndown to us Aphrodite together with Athene, and thus laid down for our\r\nprotection what is almost a law, that we should only unite to beget our\r\nkind? Surely it is for this reason that, in agreement with the course of\r\nthe sun, all plants and all the tribes of living things are aroused to\r\nbring forth their kind. What need is there for me to glorify his beams and\r\nhis light? For surely everyone knows how terrible is night without a moon\r\nor stars, so that from this he can calculate how great a boon for us is\r\nthe light of the sun? And this very light he supplies at night, without\r\nceasing, and directly, from the moon in those upper spaces where it is\r\nneeded, while he grants us through the night a truce from toil. But there\r\nwould be no limit to the account if one should endeavour to describe all\r\nhis gifts of this sort. For there is no single blessing in our lives which\r\nwe do not receive as a gift from this god, either perfect from him alone,\r\nor, through the other gods, perfected by him.)\r\n\r\nἩμῖν δέ ἐστιν ἐρχηγὸς καὶ τῆς πόλεως. οἰκεῖ γοῦν αὐτῆς οὐ τὴν ἀκρόπολιν\r\nμόνον μετὰ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς καὶ Ἀφροδίτης Ζεὺς ὁ πάντων πατὴρ ὑμνούμενος, ἀλλὰ\r\nκαὶ Ἀπόλλων ἐπὶ τῷ Παλλαντίῳ λόφῳ καὶ Ἥλιος αὐτὸς τοῦτο τὸ(753) κοινὸν\r\nὄνομα πᾶσι καὶ γνώριμον.

And I could say much to prove that we, the sons\r\nof Romulus and Aeneas, are in every way and in all respects connected with\r\nhim, but I will mention briefly only what is most familiar. According to\r\nthe legend, Aeneas is the son of Aphrodite, who is subordinate to Helios\r\nand is his kinswoman. And the tradition has been handed down that the\r\nfounder of our city was the son of Ares, and the paradoxical element in\r\nthe tale has been believed because of the portents which later appeared to\r\nsupport it. For a she‐wolf, they say, gave him suck. Now I am aware that\r\nAres, who is called Azizos by the Syrians who inhabit Emesa, precedes\r\nHelios in the sacred procession, but I mentioned it before, so I think I\r\nmay let that pass. But why is the wolf sacred only to Ares and not to\r\nHelios? Yet men call the period of a year “lycabas,”(757) which is derived\r\nfrom “wolf.” And not only Homer(758) and the famous men of Greece call it\r\nby this name, but also the god himself, when he says:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ὀρχηθμῷ λυκάβαντα δυωδεκάμηνα κέλευθα.\r\n\r\n    (“With dancing does he bring to a close his journey of twelve\r\n    months, even the lycabas.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n[C] βούλει οὖν ἔτι σοι φράσω μεῖζον τεκμήριον, ὅτι ἄρα ὁ τῆς πόλεως ἡμῶν\r\nοἰκιστὴς οὐχ ὑπ᾽ Ἀρεως κατεπέμφθη μόνον, ἀλλ᾽ ἴσως αὐτῷ τῆς μὲν τοῦ\r\nσώματος κατασκευῆς συνεπελάβετο δαίμων ἀρήιος καὶ γενναῖος, ὁ λεγόμενος\r\nἐπιφοιτῆσαι τῇ Σιλβίᾳ λουτρὰ τῇ θεῷ φερούσῃ, τὸ δὲ ὅλον ἐξ Ἡλίου κατῆλθεν\r\nἡ ψυχὴ τοῦ θεοῦ Κυρίνου· πειστέον γὰρ οἶμαι τῇ φήμῃ.

And\r\nthe close conjunction of Helios and Selene, who share the empire over the\r\nvisible world, even as it had caused his soul to descend to earth, in like\r\nmanner caused to mount upwards him whom it received back from the earth,\r\nafter blotting out with fire from a thunderbolt(763) the mortal part of\r\nhis body. So clearly did she who creates earthly matter, she whose place\r\nis at the furthest point below the sun, receive Quirinus when he was sent\r\ndown to earth by Athene, goddess of Forethought; and when he took flight\r\nagain from earth she led him back straightway to Helios, the King of the\r\nAll.)\r\n\r\n[155] Ἔτι σοι βούλει περὶ τῶν αὐτῶν φράσω τεκμήριον τοῦ Νόμα τοῦ βασιλέως\r\nἔργον; ἄσβεστον ἐξ ἡλίου φυλάττουσι φλόγα παρθένοι παρ᾽ ἡμῖν ἱεραὶ κατὰ\r\nτὰς διαφόρους ὥρας, αἳ δὴ τὸ γενόμενον(764) περὶ τὴν γῆν ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ πῦρ\r\nφυλάττουσιν. ἔτι τούτων μεῖζον ἔχω σοι φράσαι τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦδε τεκμήριον,\r\nαὐτοῦ τοῦ θειοτάτου βασιλέως ἔργον. οἱ μῆνες ἅπασι μὲν τοῖς ἄλλοις ὡς ἔπος\r\nεἰπεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς σελήνης ἀριθμοῦνται, [B] μόνοι δὲ ἡμεῖς καὶ Αἰγύπτιοι πρὸς\r\nτὰς ἡλίου κινήσεις ἑκάστου μετροῦμεν ἐνιαυτοῦ τὰς ἡμέρας. εἴ σοι μετὰ\r\nτοῦτο φαίην, ὡς καὶ τὸν Μίθραν τιμῶμεν καὶ ἄγομεν Ἡλίῳ τετραετηρικοὺς\r\nἀγῶνας, ἐρῶ νεώτερα· βέλτιον δὲ ἴσως ἕν τι τῶν παλαιοτέρων προθεῖναι. τοῦ\r\nγὰρ ἐνιαυσιαίου κύκλου τὴν ἀρχὴν ἄλλος ἄλλοθεν ποιούμενος, οἱ μὲν τὴν\r\nἐαρινὴν ἰσημερίαν, οἱ δὲ τὴν ἀκμὴν τοῦ θέρους, οἱ πολλοὶ δὲ φθίνουσαν ἤδη\r\nτὴν ὀπώραν, [C] Ἡλίου τὰς ἐμφανεστάτας ὑμνοῦσι δωρεάς ὁ μέν τις τὴν τῆς\r\nἐργασίας ἐνδιδομένην εὐκαιρίαν, ὅτε ἡ γῆ θάλλει καὶ γαυριᾷ, φυομένων ἄρτι\r\nτων καρπῶν ἁπάντων, γίνεται δὲ ἐπιτῆδεια πλεῖσθαι τὰ πελάγη καὶ τὸ τοῦ\r\nχειμῶνος ἀηδὲς καὶ σκυθρωπὸν ἐπὶ τὸ φαιδρότερον μεθίσταται, οἱ δὲ τὴν τοῦ\r\nθέρους ἐτίμησαν ὥραν,(765) ὡς ἀσφαλῶς τότε ὑπὶρ τῆς τῶν καρπῶν ἔχοντες\r\nθαρρῆσαι γενέσεως, τῶν μὲν σπερμάτων ἤδη συνειλεγμένων, ἀκμαίας δὲ οὔσης\r\n[D] τῆς ὀπώρας ἤδη και πεπαινομένων τῶν ἐπικειμένων καρπῶν τοῖς δένδροις.\r\nἄλλοι δὲ τούτων ἔτι κομψότεροι τέλος ἐνιαυτοῦ ὑπέλαβον τὴν τελειοτάτην τῶν\r\nκαρπῶν ἁπάντων ἀκμὴν καὶ φθίσιν· ταῦτά τοι καὶ φθινούσης ἤδη τῆς ὀπώρας\r\nἄγουσι τὰς κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν νουμηνίας. οἱ δὲ ἡμέτεροι προπάτορες ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ\r\nτοῦ θειοτάτου βασιλέως τοῦ Νόμα μειζόνως ἔτι τὸν θεὸν τοῦτον σεβόμενοι τὰ\r\nμὲν τῆς χρείας ἀπέλιπον, ἅτε οἶμαι φύσει θεῖοι καὶ περιττοὶ τὴν διάνοιαν,\r\nαὐτὸν δὲ εἶδον τούτων τὸν αἴτιον [156] καὶ ἄγειν ἔταξαν συμφώνως ἐν τῇ\r\nπαρούσῃ τῶν ὡρῶν τὴν νουμηνίαν, ὁπότε ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἥλιος αὖθις ἐπανάγει πρὸς\r\nἡμᾶς ἀφεὶς τῆς μεσημβρίας τὰ ἔσχατα καὶ ὥσπερ περὶ νύσσαν τὸν αἰγοκέρωτα\r\nκάμψας ἀπὸ τοῦ νότου πρὸς τὸν βορρᾶν ἔρχεται μεταδώσων ἡμῖν τῶν ἐπετείων\r\nἀγαθῶν. ὅτι δὲ τοῦτο ἀκριβῶς ἐκεῖνοι διανοηθέντες οὕτως ἐνεστήσαντο τὴν\r\nἐπέτειον νουμηνίαν, ἐνθένδ᾽ ἄν τις κατανοήσειεν. οὐ γὰρ οἶμαι καθ᾽ ἣν\r\nἡμέραν ὁ θεὸς τρέπεται, καθ᾽ ἣν δὲ τοῖς [B] πᾶσιν ἐμφανὴς γίνεται χωρῶν\r\nἀπὸ τῆς μεσημβρίας ἐς τὰς ἄρκτους ἄταξαν οὗτοι τὴν ἑορτήν. οὔπω μὲν γὰρ ἦν\r\nαὐτοῖς ἡ τῶν κανόνων λεπτότης γνώριμος, οὓς ἐξηῦρον μὲν Χαλδαῖοι καὶ\r\nΑἰγύπτιοι, Ἵππαρχος δὲ καὶ Πτολεμαῖος ἐτελειώσαντο, κρίνοντες δὲ αἰσθήσει\r\nτοῖς φαινομένοις ἠκολούθουν.\r\n\r\n(Do you wish me to mention yet another proof of this, I mean the work of\r\nKing Numa?(766) In Rome maiden priestesses(767) guard the undying flame of\r\nthe sun at different hours in turn; they guard the fire that is produced\r\non earth by the agency of the god. And I can tell you a still greater\r\nproof of the power of this god, which is the work of that most divine king\r\nhimself. The months are reckoned from the moon by, one may say, all other\r\npeoples; but we and the Egyptians alone reckon the days of every year\r\naccording to the movements of the sun. If after this I should say that we\r\nalso worship Mithras, and celebrate games in honour of Helios every four\r\nyears, I shall be speaking of customs that are somewhat recent.(768) But\r\nperhaps it is better to cite a proof from the remote past. The beginning\r\nof the cycle of the year is placed at different times by different\r\npeoples. Some place it at the spring equinox, others at the height of\r\nsummer, and many in the late autumn; but they each and all sing the\r\npraises of the most visible gifts of Helios. One nation celebrates the\r\nseason best adapted for work in the fields, when the earth bursts into\r\nbloom and exults, when all the crops are just beginning to sprout, and the\r\nsea begins to be safe for sailing; and the disagreeable, gloomy winter\r\nputs on a more cheerful aspect, others again award the crown to the summer\r\nseason,(769) since at that time they can safely feel confidence about the\r\nyield of the fruits, when the grains have already been harvested and\r\nmidsummer is now at its height, and the fruits on the trees are ripening.\r\nOthers again, with still more subtlety, regard as the close of the year\r\nthe time when all the fruits are in their perfect prime and decay has\r\nalready set in. For this reason they celebrate the annual festival of the\r\nNew Year in late autumn. But our forefathers, from the time of the most\r\ndivine king Numa, paid still greater reverence to the god Helios. They\r\nignored the question of mere utility, I think, because they were naturally\r\nreligious and endowed with unusual intelligence; but they saw that he is\r\nthe cause of all that is useful, and so they ordered the observance of the\r\nNew Year to correspond with the present season; that is to say when King\r\nHelios returns to us again, and leaving the region furthest south and,\r\nrounding Capricorn as though it were a goal‐post, advances from the south\r\nto the north to give us our share of the blessings of the year. And that\r\nour forefathers, because they comprehended this correctly, thus\r\nestablished the beginning of the year, one may perceive from the\r\nfollowing. For it was not, I think, the time when the god turns, but the\r\ntime when he becomes visible to all men, as he travels from south to\r\nnorth, that they appointed for the festival. For still unknown to them was\r\nthe nicety of those laws which the Chaldæans and Egyptians discovered, and\r\nwhich Hipparchus(770) and Ptolemy(771) perfected: but they judged simply\r\nby sense‐perception, and were limited to what they could actually see.)\r\n\r\nΟὕτω δὲ ταῦτα καὶ παρὰ τῶν μεταγενεστέρων, ὡς ἔφην, ἔχοντα κατενοήθη. πρὸ\r\nτῆς νουμηνίας, εὐθέως μετὰ τὸν τελευταῖον τοῦ Κρόνου μῆνα, ποιοῦμεν Ἡλίῳ\r\n[C] τὸν περιφανέστατον ἀγῶνα, τὴν ἑορτὴν Ἡλίῳ καταφημίσαντες ἀνικήτῳ, μεθ᾽\r\nὃν οὐδὲν θέμις ὧν ὁ τελευταῖος μὴν ἔχει σκυθρωπῶν μέν, ἀναγκαίων δ᾽ ὅμως,\r\nἐπιτελεσθῆναι θεαμάτων, ἀλλὰ τοῖς Κρονίοις οὖσι τελευταίοις εὐθὺς συνάπτει\r\nκατὰ τὸν κύκλον τὰ Ἡλίαια, ἃ δὴ πολλάκις μοι δοῖεν οἱ βασιλεῖς ὑμνῆσαι καὶ\r\nἐπιτελέσαι θεοί, καὶ πρό γε τῶν ἄλλων αὐτὸς ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν ὅλων Ἥλιος, ὁ\r\nπερὶ τὴν τἀγαθοῦ γόνιμον οὐσίαν ἐξ ἁιδίου προελθὼν μέσος [D] ἐν μέσοις\r\nτοῖς νοεροῖς θεοῖς, συνοχῆς τε αὐτοὺς πληρώσας καὶ κάλλους μυρίου καὶ\r\nπεριουσίας γονίμου καὶ τελείου νοῦ καὶ πάντων ἀθρόως τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἀχρόνως,\r\nκαὶ ἐν τῷ νῦν ἐλλάμπων εἰς τὴν ἐμφανῆ μέσην τοῦ παντὸς οὐρανοῦ φερομένην\r\nἕδραν οἰκείαν ἐξ ἀιδίου, καὶ μεταδιδοὺς τῷ φαινομένῳ παντὶ τοῦ νοητοῦ\r\nκάλλους, τὸν δὲ οὐρανὸν σύμπαντα πληρώσας τοσούτων θεῶν [157] ὁπόσων αὐτὸς\r\nἐν ἑαυτῷ νοερῶς ἔχει, περὶ αὐτὸν ἀμερίστως πληθυνομένων καὶ ἑνοειδῶς αὐτῷ\r\nσυνημμένων, οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸν ὑπὸ τὴν σελήνην τόπον διὰ τῆς ἀειγενεσίας\r\nσυνέχων καὶ τῶν ἐνδιδομένων ἐκ τοῦ κυκλικοῦ σώματος ἀγαθῶν, ἐπιμελόμενος\r\nτοῦ τε(772) κοινοῦ τῶν ἀνθρώπων γένους ἰδίᾳ τε τῆς ἡμετέρας πόλεως, ὥσπερ\r\nοὖν καὶ τὴν ἡμετέραν ἐξ ἀιδίου ψυχὴν ὑπέστησεν, ὀπαδὸν ἀποφήνας αὑτοῦ.\r\nταῦτά τε οὖν, ὅσα [B] μικρῷ πρόσθεν ηὐξάμην, δοίη, καὶ ἔτι κοινῇ μὲν τῇ\r\nπόλει τὴν ἐνδεχομένην ἀιδιότητα μετ᾽ εὐνοίας χορηγῶν φυλάττοι, ἡμῖν δὲ ἐπὶ\r\nτοσοῦτον εὖ πρᾶξαι τά τε ἀνθρώπινα καὶ τὰ θεῖα δοίη, ἐφ᾽ ὅσον βιῶναι\r\nσυγχωρεῖ, ζῆν δὲ καὶ ἐμπολιτεύεσθαι τῷ βίῳ δοίη ἐφ᾽ ὅσον αὐτῷ τε ἐκείνῳ\r\nφίλον ἡμῖν τε λώιον καὶ τοῖς κοινοῖς συμφέρον Ῥωμαίων πράγμασιν.\r\n\r\n(But the truth of these facts was recognised, as I said, by a later\r\ngeneration. Before the beginning of the year, at the end of the month\r\nwhich is called after Kronos,(773) we celebrate in honour of Helios the\r\nmost splendid games, and we dedicate the festival to the Invincible Sun.\r\nAnd after this it is not lawful to perform any of the shows that belong to\r\nthe last month, gloomy as they are, though necessary. But, in the cycle,\r\nimmediately after the end of the Kronia(774) follow the Heliaia. That\r\nfestival may the ruling gods grant me to praise and to celebrate with\r\nsacrifice! And above all the others may Helios himself, the King of the\r\nAll, grant me this, even he who from eternity has proceeded from the\r\ngenerative substance of the Good: even he who is midmost of the midmost\r\nintellectual gods; who fills them with continuity and endless beauty and\r\nsuperabundance of generative power and perfect reason, yea with all\r\nblessings at once, and independently of time! And now he illumines his own\r\nvisible abode, which from eternity moves as the centre of the whole\r\nheavens, and bestows a share of intelligible beauty on the whole visible\r\nworld, and fills the whole heavens with the same number of gods as he\r\ncontains in himself in intellectual form. And without division they reveal\r\nthemselves in manifold form surrounding him, but they are attached to him\r\nto form a unity. Aye, but also, through his perpetual generation and the\r\nblessings that he bestows from the heavenly bodies, he holds together the\r\nregion beneath the moon. For he cares for the whole human race in common,\r\nbut especially for my own city,(775) even as also he brought into being my\r\nsoul from eternity, and made it his follower. All this, therefore, that I\r\nprayed for a moment ago, may he grant, and further may he, of his grace,\r\nendow my city as a whole with eternal existence, so far as is possible,\r\nand protect her; and for myself personally, may he grant that, so long as\r\nI am permitted to live, I may prosper in my affairs both human and divine;\r\nfinally may he grant me to live and serve the state with my life, so long\r\nas is pleasing to himself and well for me and expedient for the Roman\r\nEmpire!)\r\n\r\nΤαῦτά σοι, ὦ φίλε Σαλούστιε, κατὰ τὴν τριπλῆν τοῦ θεοῦ δημιουργίαν [C] ἐν\r\nτρισὶ μάλιστα νυξὶν ὡς οἷόν τε ἦν ἐπελθόντα μοι τῇ μνήμῃ καὶ γράψαι πρὸς\r\nσὲ ἐτόλμησα, ἐπεί σοι καὶ τὸ πρότερον εἰς τὰ Κρόνια γεγραμμένον ἡμῖν οὐ\r\nπαντάπασιν ἀπόβλητον ἐφάνη. τελειοτέροις δ᾽ εἰ βούλει περὶ τῶν αὐτῶν καὶ\r\nμυστικωτέροις λόγοις ἐπιστῆσαι, ἐντυχὼν τοῖς παρὰ τοῦ θείου γενομένοις\r\nἸαμβλίχου περὶ τῶν αὐτῶν τούτων συγγράμμασι τὸ τέλος ἐκεῖσε τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης\r\n[D] εὑρήσεις σοφίας. δοίη δ᾽ ὁ μέγας Ἥλιος μηδὲν ἔλαττόν με τὰ περὶ αὐτοῦ\r\nγνῶναι, καὶ διδάξαι κοινῇ τε ἅπαντας, ἰδίᾳ δὲ τοὺς μανθάνειν ἀξίους. ἕως\r\nδέ μοι τοῦτο δίδωσιν ὁ θεός, κοινῇ θεραπεύωμεν τὸν τῷ θεῷ φίλον Ἰάμβλιχον,\r\nὅθεν καὶ νῦν ὀλίγα ἐκ πολλῶν ἐπὶ νοῦν ἐλθόντα διεληλύθαμεν. ἐκείνου δὲ εὖ\r\nοἶδα ὡς οὐδεὶς ἐρεῖ τι τελειότερον, οὐδὲ εἰ πολλὰ πάνυ προσταλαιπωρήσας\r\nκαινοτομήσειεν· ἐκβήσεται γάρ, ὡς εἰκός, [158] τῆς ἀληθεστάτης τοῦ θεοῦ\r\nνοήσεως. ἦν μὲν οὖν ἴσως μάταιον, εἰ διδασκαλίας χάριν ἐποιούμην τοὺς\r\nλόγους, αὐτὸν(776) μετ᾽ ἐκεῖνόν τι συγγράφειν, ἐπεὶ δὲ ὕμνον ἐθέλων\r\nδιελθεῖν τοῦ θεοῦ χαριστήριον ἐν τούτῳ τόπον ὑπελάμβανον τοῦ(777) περὶ τῆς\r\nοὐσίας αὐτοῦ φράσαι κατὰ δύναμιν τὴν ἐμήν, οὐ μάτην οἶμαι πεποιῆσθαι τοὺς\r\nλόγους τούσδε, τὸ\r\n\r\n(This discourse, friend Sallust,(778) I composed in three nights at most,\r\nin harmony with the three‐fold creative power of the god,(779) as far as\r\npossible just as it occurred to my memory: and I have ventured to write it\r\ndown and to dedicate it to you because you thought my earlier work on the\r\nKronia(780) was not wholly worthless. But if you wish to meet with a more\r\ncomplete and more mystical treatment of the same theme, then read the\r\nwritings of the inspired Iamblichus on this subject,(781) and you will\r\nfind there the most consummate wisdom which man can achieve. And may\r\nmighty Helios grant that I too may attain to no less perfect knowledge of\r\nhimself, and that I may instruct all men, speaking generally, but\r\nespecially those who are worthy to learn. And so long as Helios grants let\r\nus all in common revere Iamblichus, the beloved of the gods. For he is the\r\nsource for what I have here set down, a few thoughts from many, as they\r\noccurred to my mind. However I know well that no one can utter anything\r\nmore perfect than he, nay not though he should labour long at the task and\r\nsay very much that is new. For he will naturally diverge thereby from the\r\ntruest knowledge of the god. Therefore it would probably have been a vain\r\nundertaking to compose anything after Iamblichus on the same subject if I\r\nhad written this discourse for the sake of giving instruction. But since I\r\nwished to compose a hymn to express my gratitude to the god, I thought\r\nthat this was the best place in which to tell, to the best of my power, of\r\nhis essential nature. And so I think that not in vain has this discourse\r\nbeen composed.

In the Fifth Oration, which is, like the Fourth, a\r\nhymn, Julian describes the entrance of the Goddess into Italy in the third\r\ncentury B.C. In Greece she had been received long before, but the more\r\ncivilised Hellenes had not welcomed, as did the Romans, the more barbarous\r\nfeatures of the cult, the mutilated priests, the Galli, and the worship of\r\nAttis.(783) They preferred the less emotional cult of the Syrian Adonis.\r\nIn Athens the Mother of the Gods was early identified with Gaia the Earth\r\nMother, and the two became inextricably confused.(784) But Julian, in this\r\nmore Roman than Greek, does not shrink from the Oriental conception of\r\nCybele as the lover of Attis, attended by eunuch priests, or the frenzy of\r\nrenunciation described by Catullus.(785) But he was first of all a Neo‐\r\nPlatonist, and the aim of this hymn as of the Fourth Oration is to adapt\r\nto his philosophy a popular cult and to give its Mysteries a philosophic\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nThe Mithraic religion, seeking to conciliate the other cults of the\r\nempire, had from the first associated with the sun‐god the worship of the\r\nMagna Mater, and Attis had been endowed with the attributes of Mithras.\r\nThough Julian’s hymn is in honour of Cybele he devotes more attention to\r\nAttis. Originally the myth of Cybele symbolises the succession of the\r\nseasons; the disappearance of Attis the sun‐god is the coming of winter;\r\nhis mutilation is the barrenness of nature when the sun has departed; his\r\nrestoration to Cybele is the renewal of spring. In all this he is the\r\ncounterpart of Persephone among the Greeks and of Adonis in Syria. Julian\r\ninterprets the myth in connection with the three worlds described in the\r\nFourth Oration. Cybele is a principle of the highest, the intelligible\r\nworld, the source of the intellectual gods. Attis is not merely a sun‐god:\r\nhe is a principle of the second, the intellectual world, who descends to\r\nthe visible world in order to give it order and fruitfulness. Julian\r\nexpresses the Neo‐Platonic dread and dislike of matter, of the variable,\r\nthe plural and unlimited. Cybele the intelligible principle would fain\r\nhave restrained Attis the embodiment of intelligence from association with\r\nmatter. His recall and mutilation symbolise the triumph of unity over\r\nmultiformity, of mind over matter. His restoration to Cybele symbolises\r\nthe escape of our souls from the world of generation.\r\n\r\nJulian follows Plotinus(786) in regarding the myths as allegories to be\r\ninterpreted by the philosopher and the theosophist. They are riddles to be\r\nsolved, and the paradoxical element in them is designed to turn our minds\r\nto the hidden truth. For laymen the myth is enough. Like all the Neo‐\r\nPlatonists he sometimes uses phrases which imply human weakness or\r\nchronological development for his divinities and then withdraws those\r\nphrases, explaining that they must be taken in another sense. His attitude\r\nto myths is further defined in the Sixth(787) and Seventh Orations. The\r\nFifth Oration can hardly be understood apart from the Fourth, and both\r\nmust present many difficulties to a reader who is unfamiliar with\r\nPlotinus, Porphyry, the treatise _On the Mysteries_, formerly attributed\r\nto Iamblichus, Sallust, _On the Gods and the World_, and the extant\r\ntreatises and fragments of Iamblichus. Julian composed this treatise at\r\nPessinus in Phrygia, when he was on his way to Persia, in 362 A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Caesar)\r\n\r\nΕΙΣ ΤΗΝ ΜΗΤΕΡΑ ΤΩΝ ΘΕΩΝ\r\n\r\n(Hymn to the Mother of the Gods)\r\n\r\nἎρά γε χρὴ φάναι καὶ ὑπὲρ τούτων; καὶ ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀρρήτων γράψομεν καὶ τὰ\r\nἀνέξοιστα ἐξοίσομεν(788) καὶ τὰ ἀνεκλάλητα ἐκλαλήσομεν; [159] τίς μὲν ὁ\r\nἌττις ἤτοι Γάλλος, τίς δὲ ἡ τῶν θεῶν Μήτηρ, καὶ ὁ τῆς ἁγνείας ταυτησί\r\nτρόπος ὁποῖος, καὶ προσέτι τοῦ χάριν οὑτοσὶ(789) τοιοῦτος ἡμῖν ἐξ ἀρχῆς\r\nκατεδείχθη, παραδοθεὶς μὲν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχαιοτάτων Φρυγῶν, παραδεχθεὶς δὲ\r\nπρῶτον ὑφ᾽ Ἑλλήνων, καὶ τούτων οὐ τῶν τυχόντων, ἀλλ᾽ Ἀθηναίων, ἔργοις\r\nδιδαχθέντων, ὅτι μὴ καλῶς ἐτώθασαν ἐπὶ τῷ τελοῦντι τὰ ὄργια τῆς Μητρός;\r\nλέγονται γὰρ οὗτοι περιυβρίσαι [B] καὶ ἀπελάσαι τὸν Γάλλον ὡς τὰ θεῖα\r\nκαινοτομοῦντα, οὐ ξυνέντες ὁποῖόν τι τῆς θεοῦ τὸ χρῆμα καὶ ὡς ἡ παρ᾽\r\nαὐτοῖς τιμωμένη Δηὼ καὶ Ῥέα καὶ Δημήτηρ. εἶτα μῆνις τὸ ἐντεῦθεν τῆς θεοῦ\r\nκαὶ θεραπεία τῆς μήνιδος. ἡ γὰρ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς καλοῖς ἡγεμὼν γενομένη τοῖς\r\nἝλλησιν, ἡ τοῦ Πυθίου πρόμαντις θεοῦ, τὴν τῆς Μητρὸς τῶν θεῶν μῆνιν\r\nἐκέλευσεν ἱλάσκεσθαι· καὶ ἀνέστη, φασίν, ἐπὶ τούτῳ τὸ μητρῷον, οὗ τοῖς\r\nἈθηναίοις δημοσίᾳ πάντα ἐφυλάττετο τὰ γραμματεῖα. μετὰ δὴ [C] τοὺς Ἕλληνας\r\nαὐτα Ῥωμαῖοι παρεδέξαντο, συμβουλεύσαντος καὶ αὐτοῖς τοῦ Πυθίου ἐπὶ τὸν\r\nπρὸς Καρχηδονίους πόλεμον ἄγειν ἐκ Φρυγίας τὴν θεὸν σύμμαχον. καὶ οὐδὲν\r\nἴσως κωλύει προσθεῖναι μικρὰν(790) ἱστορίαν ἐνταῦθα. μαθόντες γὰρ τὸν\r\nχρησμὸν στέλλουσιν οἱ τῆς θεοφιλοῦς οἰκήτορες Ῥώμης πρεσβείαν αἰτήσουσαν\r\nπαρὰ τῶν Περγάμου βασιλέων, οἳ τότε ἐκράτουν τῆς Φρυγίας, καὶ παρ᾽ αὐτῶν\r\nδὲ τῶν Φρυγῶν τῆς θεοῦ [D] τὸ ἁγιώτατον ἄγαλμα. λαβόντες δὲ ἦγον τὸν ἱερὸν\r\nφόρτον ἐνθέντες εὐρείᾳ φορτίδι πλεῖν εὐπετῶς δυναμένῃ τὰ τοσαῦτα πελάγη.\r\nπεραιωθεῖσα δὲ Αἴγαιόν τε καὶ Ἰόνιον, εἶτα περιπλεύσασα Σικελίαν τε καὶ τὸ\r\nΤυρρηνὸν πέλαγος ἐπὶ τὰς ἐκβολὰς τοῦ Τύβριδος κατήγετο· καὶ δῆμος ἐξεχεῖτο\r\nτῆς πόλεως σὺν τῇ γερουσίᾳ, ὑπήντων γε μὴν πρὸ τῶν ἄλλων ἱερεῖς τε καὶ\r\nἱέρειαι πᾶσαι καὶ πάντες ἐν κόσμῳ τῷ πρέποντι κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, [160]\r\nμετέωροι πρὸς τὴν ναῦν οὐριοδρομοῦσαν ἀποβλέποντες, καὶ περὶ τὴν τρόπιν\r\nἀπεσκόπουν τὸ ῥόθιον σχιζομένων τῶν κυμάτων· εἶτα εἰσπλέουσαν ἐδεξιοῦντο\r\nτὴν ναῦν προσκυνοῦντες ἕκαστος ὡς ἔτυχε προσεστὼς πόρρωθεν. ἡ δὲ ὥσπερ\r\nἐνδείξασθαι τῷ Ῥωμαίων ἐθέλουσα δήμῳ, ὅτι μὴ ξόανον ἄγουσιν ἀπὸ τῆς\r\nΦρυγίας ἄψυχον, ἔχει δὲ ἄρα δύναμίν τινα μείζω καὶ θειοτέραν ὃ δὴ παρὰ τῶν\r\nΦρυγῶν λαβόντες ἔφερον, ἐπειδὴ τοῦ Τύβριδος ἥψατο, [B] τὴν ναῦν ἵστησιν\r\nὥσπερ ῥιζωθεῖσαν ἐξαίφνης κατὰ τοῦ Τύβριδος. εἷλκον δὴ οὖν πρὸς ἀντίον τὸν\r\nῥοῦν, ἡ δὲ οὐχ εἵπετο. ὡς(791) βραχέσι δὲ ἐντετυχηκότες ὠθεῖν ἐπειρῶντο\r\nτὴν ναῦν, ἡ δὲ οὐκ εἶκεν ὠθούντων. πᾶσα δὲ μηχανὴ προσήγετο τὸ ἐντεῦθεν, ἡ\r\nδὲ οὐχ ἧττον ἀμετακίνητος ἦν· ὥστε ἐμπίπτει κατὰ τῆς ἱερωμένης τὴν\r\nπαναγεστάτην ἱερωσύνην παρθένου δεινὴ καὶ ἄδικος ὑποψία, καὶ τὴν Κλωδίαν\r\nᾐτιῶντο· [C] τοῦτο γὰρ ὄνομα ἦν τῇ σεμνῇ παρθένῳ· μὴ παντάπασιν ἄχραντον\r\nμηδὲ καθαρὰν φυλάττειν ἑαυτὴν τῷ θεῷ· ὀργίζεσθαι οὖν αὐτὴν καὶ μηνίειν\r\nἐμφανῶς· ἐδόκει γὰρ ἤδη τοῖς πᾶσιν εἶναι τὸ χρῆμα δαιμονιώτερον. ἡ δὲ τὸ\r\nμὲν πρῶτον αἰδοῦς ὑπεπίμηπλατο πρός τε τὸ ὄνομα καὶ τὴν ὑποψίαν· οὕτω πάνυ\r\nπόρρω ἐτύγχανε τῆς αἰσχρᾶς καὶ παρανόμου πράξεως. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἑώρα τὴν αἰτίαν\r\nἤδη καθ᾽ ἑαυτῆς ἐξισχύουσαν, περιελοῦσα τὴν ζώνην [D] καὶ περιθεῖσα τῆς\r\nνεὼς τοῖς ἄκροις, ὥσπερ ἐξ ἐπιπνοίας τινὸς ἀποχωρεῖν ἐκέλευεν ἅπαντας,\r\nεἶτα ἐδεῖτο τῆς θεοῦ μὴ περιιδεῖν αὐτὴν(792) ἀδίκοις ἐνεχομένην\r\nβλασφημίας. βοῶσα δὲ ὥσπερ τι κέλευσμα, φασί, ναυτικόν, Δέσποινα Μῆτερ\r\nεἴπερ εἰμὶ σώφρων, ἕπου μοι, ἔφη. καὶ δὴ τὴν ναῦν οὐκ ἐκίνησε μόνον, ἀλλὰ\r\nκαὶ εἵλκυσεν ἐπὶ πολὺ πρὸς τὸν ῥοῦν· καὶ δύο ταῦτα Ῥωμαίοις ἔδειξεν ἡ θεὸς\r\nοἶμαι κατ᾽ ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν.

And shall I write about\r\nthings not to be spoken of and divulge what ought not to be divulged?\r\nShall I utter the unutterable? Who is Attis(794) or Gallus,(795) who is\r\nthe Mother of the Gods,(796) and what is the manner of their ritual of\r\npurification? And further why was it introduced in the beginning among us\r\nRomans? It was handed down by the Phrygians in very ancient times, and was\r\nfirst taken over by the Greeks, and not by any ordinary Greeks but by\r\nAthenians who had learned by experience that they did wrong to jeer at one\r\nwho was celebrating the Mysteries of the Mother. For it is said that they\r\nwantonly insulted and drove out Gallus, on the ground that he was\r\nintroducing a new cult, because they did not understand what sort of\r\ngoddess they had to do with, and that she was that very Deo whom they\r\nworship, and Rhea and Demeter too. Then followed the wrath of the goddess\r\nand the propitiation of her wrath. For the priestess of the Pythian god\r\nwho guided the Greeks in all noble conduct, bade them propitiate the wrath\r\nof the Mother of the Gods. And so, we are told, the Metroum was built,\r\nwhere the Athenians used to keep all their state records.(797) After the\r\nGreeks the Romans took over the cult, when the Pythian god had advised\r\nthem in their turn to bring the goddess from Phrygia as an ally for their\r\nwar against the Carthaginians.(798) And perhaps there is no reason why I\r\nshould not insert here a brief account of what happened. When they learned\r\nthe response of the oracle, the inhabitants of Rome, that city beloved of\r\nthe gods, sent an embassy to ask from the kings of Pergamon(799) who then\r\nruled over Phrygia and from the Phrygians themselves the most holy\r\nstatue(800) of the goddess. And when they had received it they brought\r\nback their most sacred freight, putting it on a broad cargo‐boat which\r\ncould sail smoothly over those wide seas. Thus she crossed the Aegean and\r\nIonian Seas, and sailed round Sicily and over the Etruscan Sea, and so\r\nentered the mouth of the Tiber. And the people and the Senate with them\r\npoured out of the city, and in front of all the others there came to meet\r\nher all the priests and priestesses in suitable attire according to their\r\nancestral custom. And in excited suspense they gazed at the ship as she\r\nran before a fair wind, and about her keel they could discern the foaming\r\nwake as she cleft the waves. And they greeted the ship as she sailed in\r\nand adored her from afar, everyone where he happened to be standing. But\r\nthe goddess, as though she desired to show the Roman people that they were\r\nnot bringing a lifeless image from Phrygia, but that what they had\r\nreceived from the Phrygians and were now bringing home possessed greater\r\nand more divine powers than an image, stayed the ship directly she touched\r\nthe Tiber, and she was suddenly as though rooted in mid‐stream. So they\r\ntried to tow her against the current, but she did not follow. Then they\r\ntried to push her off, thinking they had grounded on a shoal, but for all\r\ntheir efforts she did not move. Next every possible device was brought to\r\nbear, but in spite of all she remained immovable. Thereupon a terrible and\r\nunjust suspicion fell on the maiden who had been consecrated to the most\r\nsacred office of priestess, and they began to accuse Claudia(801)—for that\r\nwas the name of that noble maiden(802)—of not having kept herself\r\nstainless and pure for the goddess; wherefore they said that the goddess\r\nwas angry and was plainly declaring her wrath. For by this time the thing\r\nseemed to all to be supernatural. Now at first she was filled with shame\r\nat the mere name of the thing and the suspicion; so very far was she from\r\nsuch shameless and lawless behaviour. But when she saw that the charge\r\nagainst her was gaining strength, she took off her girdle and fastened it\r\nabout the prow of the ship, and, like one divinely inspired, bade all\r\nstand aside: and then she besought the goddess not to suffer her to be\r\nthus implicated in unjust slanders. Next, as the story goes, she cried\r\naloud as though it were some nautical word of command, “O Goddess Mother,\r\nif I am pure follow me!” And lo, she not only made the ship move, but even\r\ntowed her for some distance up stream. Two things, I think, the goddess\r\nshowed the Romans on that day: first that the freight they were bringing\r\nfrom Phrygia had no small value, but was priceless, and that this was no\r\nwork of men’s hands but truly divine, not lifeless clay but a thing\r\npossessed of life and divine powers. This, I say, was one thing that the\r\ngoddess showed them. And the other was that no one of the citizens could\r\nbe good or bad and she not know thereof. Moreover the war of the Romans\r\nagainst the Carthaginians forthwith took a favourable turn, so that the\r\nthird war was waged only for the walls of Carthage itself.(803))\r\n\r\n[B] Τὰ μὲν οὖν τῆς ἱστορίας, εἰ καί τισιν ἀπίθανα δόξει καὶ φιλοσόφῳ\r\nπροσήκειν οὐδὲν οὐδὲ θεολόγῳ, λεγέσθω μὴ μεῖον, κοινῇ μὲν ὑπὸ πλείστων\r\nἱστοριογράφων ἀναγραφόμενα, σωζόμενα δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ χαλκῶν εἰκόνων ἐν τῇ\r\nκρατίστῃ καὶ θεοφιλεῖ Ῥώμῃ. καίτοι με οὐ λέληθεν ὅτι φήσουσιν αὐτά τινες\r\nτῶν λίαν σοφῶν ὕθλους εἶναι γρᾳδίων οὐκ ἀνεκτούς. ἐμοὶ δὲ δοκεῖ ταῖς\r\nπόλεσι πιστεύειν μᾶλλον τὰ τοιαῦτα ἢ τουτοισὶ τοῖς κομψοῖς, ὧν τὸ ψυχάριον\r\nδριμὺ μέν, ὑγιὲς δὲ οὐδὲ ἓν βλέπει.(804)\r\n\r\n(As for this narrative, though some will think it incredible and wholly\r\nunworthy of a philosopher or a theologian, nevertheless let it here be\r\nrelated.

But since I have never met with it I do not know\r\nwhether at any point it may chance to agree with my discourse. But him\r\nwhom I call Gallus or Attis I discern of my own knowledge to be the\r\nsubstance of generative and creative Mind which engenders all things down\r\nto the lowest plane of matter,(806) and comprehends in itself all the\r\nconcepts and causes of the forms that are embodied in matter. For truly\r\nthe forms of all things are not in all things, and in the highest and\r\nfirst causes we do not find the forms of the lowest and last, after which\r\nthere is nothing save privation(807) coupled with a dim idea. Now there\r\nare many substances and very many creative gods, but the nature of the\r\nthird creator,(808) who contains in himself the separate concepts of the\r\nforms that are embodied in matter and also the connected chain of causes,\r\nI mean that nature which is last in order, and through its superabundance\r\nof generative power descends even unto our earth through the upper region\r\nfrom the stars,—this is he whom we seek, even Attis. But perhaps I ought\r\nto distinguish more clearly what I mean. We assert that matter exists and\r\nalso form embodied in matter. But if no cause be assigned prior to these\r\ntwo, we should be introducing, unconsciously, the Epicurean doctrine. For\r\nif there be nothing of higher order than these two principles, then a\r\nspontaneous motion and chance brought them together. “But,” says some\r\nacute Peripatetic like Xenarchus, “we see that the cause of these is the\r\nfifth or cyclic substance. Aristotle is absurd when he investigates and\r\ndiscusses these matters, and Theophrastus likewise. At any rate he\r\noverlooked the implications of a well‐known utterance of his. For just as\r\nwhen he came to incorporeal and intelligible substance he stopped short\r\nand did not inquire into its cause, and merely asserted that this is what\r\nit is by nature; surely in the case of the fifth substance also he ought\r\nto have assumed that its nature is to be thus; and he ought not to have\r\ngone on to search for causes, but should have stopped at these, and not\r\nfallen back on the intelligible, which has no independent existence by\r\nitself, and in any case represents a bare supposition.” This is the sort\r\nof thing that Xenarchus says, as I remember to have heard. Now whether\r\nwhat he says is correct or not, let us leave to the extreme Peripatetics\r\nto refine upon. But that his view is not agreeable to me is, I think,\r\nclear to everyone. For I hold that the theories of Aristotle himself are\r\nincomplete unless they are brought into harmony with those of Plato(809);\r\nor rather we must make these also agree with the oracles that have been\r\nvouchsafed to us by the gods.)\r\n\r\nἘκεῖνο δὲ ἴσως ἄξιον πυθέσθαι, πῶς τὸ κυκλικὸν σῶμα δύναται τὰς ἀσωμάτους\r\nἔχειν αἰτίας τῶν ἐνύλων εἰδῶν. ὅτι μὲν γὰρ δίχα τούτων ὑποστῆναι τὴν\r\nγένεσιν οὐκ ἐνδέχεται, πρόδηλόν ἐστί που καὶ σαφές. τοῦ χάριν γάρ ἐστι\r\nτοσαῦτα τὰ γιγνόμενα; πόθεν δὲ ἄρρεν καὶ θῆλυ; πόθεν δὲ ἡ κατὰ γένος τῶν\r\nὄντων ἐν ὡρισμένοις εἴδεσι διαφορά, [163] εἰ μή τινες εἶεν προϋπάρχοντες\r\nκαὶ προϋφεστῶτες(810) λόγοι αἰτίαι τε ἐν παραδείγματος λόγῳ προϋφεστῶσαι;\r\nπρὸς ἃς εἴπερ ἀμβλυώττομεν, ἔτι καθαιρώμεθα τὰ ὄμματα τῆς ψυχῆς. κάθαρσις\r\nδὲ ὀρθὴ στραφῆναι πρὸς ἑαυτὸν καὶ κατανοῆσαι, πῶς μὲν ἡ ψυχὴ καὶ ὁ ἔνυλος\r\nνοῦς ὥσπερ ἐκμαγεῖόν τι τῶν ἐνύλων εἰδῶν καὶ εἰκών ἐστιν. ἓν γὰρ οὐδέν\r\nἐστι τῶν σωμάτων ἢ τῶν [B] περὶ τὰ σώματα γινομένων τε καὶ θεωρουμένων\r\nἀσωμάτων, οὗ τὴν φαντασίαν ὁ νοῦς οὐ δύναται λαβεῖν ἀσωμάτως, ὅπερ οὔποτ᾽\r\nἂν ἐποίησεν, εἰ μή τι ξυγγενὲς εἶχεν αὐτοῖς φύσει. ταῦτά τοι καὶ\r\nἈριστοτέλης τὴν ψυχὴν τόπον εἰδῶν ἔφη, πλὴν οὐκ ἐνεργείᾳ, ἀλλὰ δυνάμει.\r\nτὴν μὲν οὖν τοιαύτην ψυχὴν καὶ τὴν ἐπεστραμμένην πρὸς τὸ σῶμα δυνάμει\r\nταῦτα ἔχειν ἀναγκαῖον· εἰ δέ τις ἄσχετος εἴη καὶ ἀμιγὴς ταύτῃ, τοὺς λόγους\r\nοὐκέτι δυνάμει, [C] πάντας δὲ ὑπάρχειν ἐνεργείᾳ νομιστέον. λάβωμεν δὲ αὐτὰ\r\nσαφέστερον διὰ τοῦ παραδείγματος, ᾧ καὶ Πλάτων ἐν τῷ Σοφιστῇ(811) πρὸς\r\nἕτερον μὲν λόγον, ἐχρήσατο δ᾽ οὖν ὅμως. τὸ παράδειγμα δὲ οὐκ εἰς ἀπόδειξιν\r\nφέρω τοῦ λόγου· καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ ἀποδείξει χρὴ λαβεῖν αὐτόν,(812) ἀλλ᾽ ἐπιβολῇ\r\nμόνῃ, περὶ γὰρ τῶν πρώτων αἰτιῶν ἐστιν ἢ τῶν γε ὁμοστοίχων τοῖς πρώτοις,\r\nεἴπερ ἡμῖν ἐστιν, ὥσπερ οὖν ἄξιον νομίζειν, [D] καὶ ὁ Ἄττις θεός. τί δὲ\r\nκαὶ ποῖόν ἐστι τὸ παράδειγμα; φησί(813) που Πλάτων, τῶν περὶ τὴν μίμησιν\r\nδιατριβόντων εἰ μὲν ἐθέλοι τις μιμεῖσθαι, ὥστε καθυφεστάναι τὰ μιμητά,\r\nἐργώδη τε εἶναι καὶ χαλεπὴν καὶ νὴ Δία γε τοῦ ἀδυνάτου πλησίον μᾶλλον,\r\nεὔκολον δὲ καὶ ῥᾳδίαν καὶ σφόδρα δυνατὴν τὴν διὰ τοῦ δοκεῖν τὰ ὄντα\r\nμιμουμένην. ὅταν οὖν τὸ κάτοπτρον λαβόντες περιφέρωμεν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ὄντων\r\nῥᾳδίως ἀπομαξάμενοι, [164] δείκνυμεν ἑκάστου τοὺς τύπους. ἐκ τούτου τοῦ\r\nπαραδείγματος ἐπὶ τὸ εἰρημένον μεταβιβάσωμεν τὸ ὁμοίωμα, ἵν᾽ ᾖ τὸ μὲν\r\nκάτοπτρον ὁ λεγόμενος ὑπὸ Ἀριστοτέλους δυνάμει τόπος εἰδῶν.\r\n\r\n(But this it is perhaps worth while to inquire, how the cyclic\r\nsubstance(814) can contain the incorporeal causes of the forms that are\r\nembodied in matter. For that, apart from these causes, it is not possible\r\nfor generation to take place is, I think, clear and manifest. For why are\r\nthere so many kinds of generated things? Whence arise masculine and\r\nfeminine? Whence the distinguishing characteristics of things according to\r\ntheir species in well‐defined types, if there are not pre‐existing and\r\npre‐established concepts, and causes which existed beforehand to serve as\r\na pattern?(815) And if we discern these causes but dimly, let us still\r\nfurther purify the eyes of the soul. And the right kind of purification is\r\nto turn our gaze inwards and to observe how the soul and embodied Mind are\r\na sort of mould(816) and likeness of the forms that are embodied in\r\nmatter. For in the case of the corporeal, or of things that though\r\nincorporeal come into being and are to be studied in connection with the\r\ncorporeal, there is no single thing whose mental image the mind cannot\r\ngrasp independently of the corporeal. But this it could not have done if\r\nit did not possess something naturally akin to the incorporeal forms.\r\nIndeed it is for this reason that Aristotle himself called the soul the\r\n“place of the forms,”(817) only he said that the forms are there not\r\nactually but potentially. Now a soul of this sort, that is allied with\r\nmatter, must needs possess these forms potentially only, but a soul that\r\nshould be independent and unmixed in this way we must believe would\r\ncontain all the concepts, not potentially but actually. Let us make this\r\nclearer by means of the example which Plato himself employed in the\r\nSophist, with reference certainly to another theory, but still he did\r\nemploy it. And I bring forward the illustration, not to prove my argument;\r\nfor one must not try to grasp it by demonstration, but only by\r\napprehension. For it deals with the first causes, or at least those that\r\nrank with the first, if indeed, as it is right to believe, we must regard\r\nAttis also as a god. What then, and of what sort is this illustration?\r\nPlato says that, if any man whose profession is imitation desire to\r\nimitate in such a way that the original is exactly reproduced, this method\r\nof imitation is troublesome and difficult, and, by Zeus, borders on the\r\nimpossible; but pleasant and easy and quite possible is the method which\r\nonly seems to imitate real things. For instance, when we take up a mirror\r\nand turn it round we easily get an impression of all objects, and show the\r\ngeneral outline of every single thing. From this example let us go back to\r\nthe analogy I spoke of, and let the mirror stand for what Aristotle calls\r\nthe “place of the forms” potentially.)\r\n\r\nΑὐτὰ δὲ χρὴ τὰ εἴδη πρότερον ὑφεστάναι πάντως ἐνεργείᾳ τοῦ δυνάμει. τῆς\r\nτοίνυν ἐν ἡμῖν ψυχῆς, ὡς καὶ Ἀριστοτέλει δοκεῖ, δυνάμει τῶν ὄντων ἐχούσης\r\nτὰ εἴδη, ποῦ πρῶτον ἐνεργείᾳ θησόμεθα ταῦτα; πότερον ἐν τοῖς ἐνύλοις; [B]\r\nἀλλ᾽ ἔστι γε ταῦτα φανερῶς τὰ τελευταῖα. λείπεται δὴ λοιπὸν ἀύλους αἰτίας\r\nζητεῖν ἐνεργείᾳ προτεταγμένας τῶν ἐνύλων, αἷς παρυποστᾶσαν καὶ\r\nσυμπροελθοῦσαν ἡμῶν τὴν ψυχὴν δέχεσθαι μὲν ἐκεῖθεν, ὥσπερ ἐξ ὄντων τινῶν\r\nτὰ ἔσοπτρα, τοὺς τῶν εἰδῶν ἀναγκαῖον λόγους, ἐνδιδόναι δὲ διὰ τῆς φύσεως\r\nτῇ τε ὕλῃ καὶ τοῖς ἐνύλοις τουτοισὶ σώμασιν. ὅτι μὲν γὰρ ἡ φύσις ἐστὶ\r\nδημιουργὸς τῶν σωμάτων ἴσμεν, ὡς ὅλη τις οὖσα τοῦ παντός, ἡ δὲ καθ᾽\r\nἕκαστον [C] ἑνὸς ἑκάστου τῶν ἐν μέρει, πρόδηλόν ἐστί που καὶ σαφές, ἀλλ᾽ ἡ\r\nφύσις ἐνεργείᾳ δίχα φαντασίας ἐν ἡμῖν, ἡ δὲ ὑπὲρ ταύτης ψυχὴ καὶ τὴν\r\nφαντασίαν προσείληφεν. εἰ τοίνυν ἡ φύσις καὶ ὧν οὐκ ἔχει τὴν φαντασίαν\r\nἔχειν ὅμως ὁμολογεῖται τὴν αἰτίαν, ἀνθ᾽ ὅτου πρὸς θεῶν οὐχὶ τοῦτο αὐτὸ\r\nμᾶλλον ἔτι καὶ πρεσβύτερον τῇ ψυχῇ δώσομεν, ὅπου καὶ φανταστικῶς αὐτὸ\r\nγιγνώσκομεν ἤδη [D] καὶ λόγῳ καταλαμβάνομεν; εἶτα τίς οὕτως ἐστὶ\r\nφιλόνεικος, ὡς τῇ φύσει μὲν ὑπάρχειν ὁμολογεῖν τοὺς ἐνύλους λόγους, εἰ καὶ\r\nμὴ πάντας καὶ κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐνεργείᾳ, ἀλλὰ δυνάμει γε πάντας, τῇ ψυχῇ δὲ μὴ\r\nδοῦναι τοῦτο αὐτό; οὐκοῦν εἰ δυνάμει μὲν ἐν τῇ φύσει καὶ οὐκ ἐνεργείᾳ τὰ\r\nεἴδη, δυνάμει δὲ ἔτι καὶ ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ καθαρώτερον καὶ δικεκριμένως μᾶλλον,\r\nὥστε δὴ καὶ καταλαμβάνεσθαι καὶ γινώσκεσθαι, ἐνεργείᾳ δὲ οὐδαμοῦ· πόθεν\r\nἀναρτήσομεν τῆς ἀειγενεσίας τὰ πείσματα; ποῦ δὲ ἑδράσομεν [165] τοὺς ὑπὲρ\r\nτῆς ἀιδιότητος κόσμου λόγους; τὸ γὰρ τοι κυκλικὸν σῶμα ἐξ ὑποκειμένου καὶ\r\nεἴδους ἐστίν. ἀνάγκη δὴ οὖν, εἰ καὶ μήποτε ἐνεργείᾳ ταῦτα δίχα ἀλλήλων,\r\nἀλλὰ ταῖς γε ἐπινοίαις ἐκεῖνα πρῶτα ὑπάρχοντα εἶναί τε καὶ νομίζεσθαι\r\nπρεσβύτερα. οὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ δέδοταί τις καὶ τῶν ἐνύλων εἰδῶν αἰτία\r\nπροηγουμένη παντελῶς ἄυλος ὑπὸ τὸν τρίτον δημιουργόν, ὃς ἡμῖν οὐ τούτων\r\nμόνον ἐστίν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦ φαινομένου καὶ πέμπτου σώματος πατὴρ καὶ\r\nδεσπότης· [B] ἀποδιελόντες ἐκείνου τὸν Ἄττιν, τὴν ἄχρι τῆς ὕλης\r\nκαταβαίνουσαν αἰτίαν, καὶ θεὸν γόνιμον Ἄττιν εἶναι καὶ Γάλλον\r\nπεπιστεύκαμεν, ὃν δή φησιν ὁ μῦθος ἀνθῆσαι μὲν ἐκτεθέντα παρὰ Γάλλου\r\nποταμοῦ ταῖς δίναις, εἶτα καλὸν φανέντα καὶ μέγαν ἀγαπηθῆναι παρὰ τῆς\r\nΜητρὸς τῶν θεῶν. τὴν δὲ τά τε ἄλλα πάντα ἐπιτρέψαι αὐτῷ καὶ τὸν ἀστερωτὸν\r\nπεριθεῖναι(818) πῖλον.

If, therefore, the soul in us, as Aristotle himself\r\nbelieved, contains potentially the forms of existing things, where shall\r\nwe place the forms in that previous state of actuality? Shall it be in\r\nmaterial things? No, for the forms that are in them are evidently the last\r\nand lowest. Therefore it only remains to search for immaterial causes\r\nwhich exist in actuality prior to and of a higher order than the causes\r\nthat are embodied in matter. And our souls must subsist in dependence on\r\nthese and come forth together with them, and so receive from them the\r\nconcepts of the forms, as mirrors show the reflections of things; and then\r\nwith the aid of nature it bestows them on matter and on these material\r\nbodies of our world. For we know that nature is the creator of bodies,\r\nuniversal nature in some sort of the All; while that the individual nature\r\nof each is the creator of particulars is plainly evident. But nature\r\nexists in us in actuality without a mental image, whereas the soul, which\r\nis superior to nature, possesses a mental image besides. If therefore we\r\nadmit that nature contains in herself the cause of things of which she has\r\nhowever no mental image, why, in heaven’s name, are we not to assign to\r\nthe soul these same forms, only in a still higher degree, and with\r\npriority over nature, seeing that it is in the soul that we recognise the\r\nforms by means of mental images, and comprehend them by means of the\r\nconcept? Who then is so contentious as to admit on the one hand that the\r\nconcepts embodied in matter exist in nature—even though not all and\r\nequally in actuality, yet all potentially—while on the other hand he\r\nrefuses to recognise that the same is true of the soul? If therefore the\r\nforms exist in nature potentially, but not actually, and if also they\r\nexist potentially in the soul,(823) only in a still purer sense and more\r\ncompletely separated, so that they can be comprehended and recognised; but\r\nyet exist in actuality nowhere at all; to what, I ask, shall we hang the\r\nchain of perpetual generation, and on what shall we base our theories of\r\nthe imperishability of the universe? For the cyclic substance(824) itself\r\nis composed of matter and form. It must therefore follow that, even though\r\nin actuality these two, matter and form, are never separate from one\r\nanother, yet for our intelligence the forms must have prior existence and\r\nbe regarded as of a higher order. Accordingly, since for the forms\r\nembodied in matter a wholly immaterial cause has been assigned, which\r\nleads these forms under the hand of the third creator(825)—who for us is\r\nthe lord and father not only of these forms but also of the visible fifth\r\nsubstance—from that creator we distinguish Attis, the cause which descends\r\neven unto matter, and we believe that Attis or Gallus is a god of\r\ngenerative powers. Of him the myth relates that, after being exposed at\r\nbirth near the eddying stream of the river Gallus, he grew up like a\r\nflower, and when he had grown to be fair and tall, he was beloved by the\r\nMother of the Gods. And she entrusted all things to him, and moreover set\r\non his head the starry cap.(826) But if our visible sky covers the crown\r\nof Attis, must one not interpret the river Gallus as the Milky Way?(827)\r\nFor it is there, they say, that the substance which is subject to change\r\nmingles with the passionless revolving sphere of the fifth substance. Only\r\nas far as this did the Mother of the Gods permit this fair intellectual\r\ngod Attis, who resembles the sun’s rays, to leap and dance. But when he\r\npassed beyond this limit and came even to the lowest region, the myth said\r\nthat he had descended into the cave, and had wedded the nymph. And the\r\nnymph is to be interpreted as the dampness of matter; though the myth does\r\nnot here mean matter itself, but the lowest immaterial cause which\r\nsubsists prior to matter. Indeed Heracleitus also says:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ψυχῇσιν θάνατος ὑγρῇσι γενέσθαι·\r\n\r\n    (“It is death to souls to become wet.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nτοῦτον οὖν τὸν Γάλλον, τὸν νοερὸν θεόν, τὸν τῶν ἐνύλων καὶ ὑπὸ σελήνην\r\nεἰδῶν συνοχέα, τῇ προτεταγμένῃ τῆς ὕλης αἰτίᾳ συνιόντα, συνιόντα δὲ οὐχ ὡς\r\nἄλλον ἄλλῃ, [166] ἀλλ᾽ οἷον αὐτὸ εἰς ἑαυτὸ(828) λέγομεν(829) ὑποφερόμενον.\r\n\r\n(We mean therefore that this Gallus, the intellectual god, the connecting\r\nlink between forms embodied in matter beneath the region of the moon, is\r\nunited with the cause that is set over matter, but not in the sense that\r\none sex is united with another, but like an element that is gathered to\r\nitself.)\r\n\r\nΤίς οὖν ἡ Μήτηρ τῶν θεῶν; ἡ τῶν κυβερνώντων τοὺς ἐμφανεῖς νοερῶν καὶ\r\nδημιουργικῶν θεῶν πηγή, ἡ καὶ τεκοῦσα καὶ συνοικοῦσα τῷ μεγάλῳ Διὶ θεὸς\r\nὑποστᾶσα μεγάλη μετὰ τὸν μέγαν καὶ σὺν τῷ μεγάλῳ δημιουργῷ, ἡ πάσης μὲν\r\nκυρία ζωῆς, πάσης δὲ γενέσεως αἰτία, ἡ ῥᾷστα μὲν ἐπιτελοῦσα τὰ ποιούμενα,\r\nγεννῶσα δὲ δίχα πάθους καὶ δημιουργοῦσα τὰ ὄντα μετὰ τοῦ πατρός· αὕτη [B]\r\nκαὶ παρθένος ἀμήτωρ καὶ Διὸς σύνθωκος καὶ μήτηρ θεῶν ὄντως οὖσα πάντων.\r\nτῶν γὰρ νοητῶν ὑπερκοσμίων τε(830) θεῶν δεξαμένη πάντων τὰς(831) αἰτίας ἐν\r\nἑαυτῇ πηγὴ τοῖς νοεροῖς ἐγένετο. ταύτην δὴ τὴν θεὸν οὖσαν καὶ πρόνοιαν\r\nἔρως μὲν ὑπῆλθεν ἀπαθὴς Ἄττιδος· ἐθελούσια γὰρ αὐτῇ καὶ κατὰ γνώμην ἐστὶν\r\nοὐ τὰ ἔνυλα μόνον εἴδη, πολὺ δὲ πλέον τὰ τούτων αἴτια. τὴν δὴ τὰ γινόμενα\r\nκαὶ φθειρόμενα σώζουσαν [C] προμήθειαν ἐργᾶν ὁ μῦθος ἔφη τῆς δημιουργικῆς\r\nτούτων αἰτίας καὶ γονίμου, καὶ κελεύειν μὲν αὐτὴν ἐν τῷ νοητῷ τίκτειν\r\nμᾶλλον καὶ βούλεσθαι μὲν(832) πρὸς ἑαυτὴν ἐπεστράφθαι καὶ συνοικεῖν,\r\nἐπίταγμα δὲ ποιεῖσθαι, μηδενὶ τῶν ἄλλων, ἅμα μὲν τὸ ἑνοειδὲς σωτήριον\r\nδιώκουσαν, ἅμα δὲ φεύγουσαν τὸ πρὸς τὴν ὕλην νεῦσαν· πρὸς ἑαυτήν τε\r\nβλέπειν ἐκέλευσεν, οὖσαν πηγὴν μὲν τῶν δημιουργικῶν θεῶν, οὐ καθελκομένην\r\nδὲ εἰς τὴν γένεσιν οὐδὲ θελγομένην· [D] οὕτω γὰρ ἔμελλεν ὁ μέγας Ἄττις καὶ\r\nκρείττων(833) εἶναι δημιουργός, ἐπείπερ ἐν πᾶσιν ἡ πρὸς τὸ κρεῖττον\r\nἐπιστροφὴ μᾶλλόν ἐστι δραστήριος τῆς πρὸς τὸ χεῖρον νεύσεως. ἐπεὶ καὶ τὸ\r\nπέμπτον σῶμα τούτῳ δημιουργικώτερόν ἐστι τῶν τῇδε καὶ θειότερον, τῷ μᾶλλον\r\nἐστράφθαι πρὸς τοὺς θεούς, ἐπεί τοι τὸ σῶμα, κἂν αἰθέρος ᾖ τοῦ\r\nκαθαρωτάτου, ψυχῆς ἀχράντου καὶ καθαρᾶς, ὁποίαν τὴν Ἡρακλέους ὁ δημιουργὸς\r\nἐξέπεμψεν, οὐδεὶς ἂν εἰπεῖν κρεῖττον τολμήσειε.

She is the source of the\r\nintellectual(840) and creative gods, who in their turn guide the visible\r\ngods: she is both the mother and the spouse of mighty Zeus; she came into\r\nbeing next to and together with the great creator; she is in control of\r\nevery form of life, and the cause of all generation; she easily brings to\r\nperfection all things that are made; without pain she brings to birth, and\r\nwith the father’s(841) aid creates all things that are; she is the\r\nmotherless maiden,(842) enthroned at the side of Zeus, and in very truth\r\nis the Mother of all the Gods. For having received into herself the causes\r\nof all the gods, both intelligible and supra‐mundane, she became the\r\nsource of the intellectual gods. Now this goddess, who is also\r\nForethought, was inspired with a passionless love for Attis. For not only\r\nthe forms embodied in matter, but to a still greater degree the causes of\r\nthose forms, voluntarily serve her and obey her will. Accordingly the myth\r\nrelates the following: that she who is the Providence who preserves all\r\nthat is subject to generation and decay, loved their creative and\r\ngenerative cause, and commanded that cause to beget offspring rather in\r\nthe intelligible region; and she desired that it should turn towards\r\nherself and dwell with her, but condemned it to dwell with no other thing.\r\nFor only thus would that creative cause strive towards the uniformity that\r\npreserves it, and at the same time would avoid that which inclines towards\r\nmatter. And she bade that cause look towards her, who is the source of the\r\ncreative gods, and not be dragged down or allured into generation. For in\r\nthis way was mighty Attis destined to be an even mightier creation, seeing\r\nthat in all things the conversion to what is higher produces more power to\r\neffect than the inclination to what is lower. And the fifth substance\r\nitself is more creative and more divine than the elements of our earth,\r\nfor this reason, that it is more nearly connected with the gods. Not that\r\nanyone, surely, would venture to assert that any substance, even if it be\r\ncomposed of the purest aether, is superior to soul undefiled and pure,\r\nthat of Heracles for instance, as it was when the creator sent it to\r\nearth. For that soul of his both seemed to be and was more effective than\r\nafter it had bestowed itself on a body. Since even Heracles, now that he\r\nhas returned, one and indivisible, to his father one and indivisible, more\r\neasily controls his own province than formerly when he wore the garment of\r\nflesh and walked among men. And this shows that in all things the\r\nconversion to the higher is more effective than the propensity to the\r\nlower. This is what the myth aims to teach us when it says that the Mother\r\nof the Gods exhorted Attis not to leave her or to love another. But he\r\nwent further, and descended even to the lowest limits of matter. Since,\r\nhowever, it was necessary that his limitless course should cease and halt\r\nat last, mighty Helios the Corybant,(843) who shares the Mother’s throne\r\nand with her creates all things, with her has providence for all things,\r\nand apart from her does nothing, persuaded the Lion(844) to reveal the\r\nmatter. And who is the Lion? Verily we are told that he is flame‐\r\ncoloured.(845) He is, therefore, the cause that subsists prior to the hot\r\nand fiery, and it was his task to contend against the nymph and to be\r\njealous of her union with Attis. (And who the nymph is, I have said.) And\r\nthe myth says that the Lion serves the creative Providence of the world,\r\nwhich evidently means the Mother of the Gods. Then it says that by\r\ndetecting and revealing the truth, he caused the youth’s castration. What\r\nis the meaning of this castration? It is the checking of the unlimited.\r\nFor now was generation confined within definite forms checked by creative\r\nProvidence. And this would not have happened without the so‐called madness\r\nof Attis, which overstepped and transgressed due measure, and thereby made\r\nhim become weak so that he had no control over himself. And it is not\r\nsurprising that this should come to pass, when we have to do with the\r\ncause that ranks lowest among the gods. For consider the fifth substance,\r\nwhich is subject to no change of any sort, in the region of the light of\r\nthe moon: I mean where our world of continuous generation and decay\r\nborders on the fifth substance. We perceive that in the region of her\r\nlight it seems to undergo certain alterations and to be affected by\r\nexternal influences. Therefore it is not contradictory to suppose that our\r\nAttis also is a sort of demigod—for that is actually the meaning of the\r\nmyth—or rather for the universe he is wholly god, for he proceeds from the\r\nthird creator, and after his castration is led upwards again to the Mother\r\nof the Gods. But though he seems to lean and incline towards matter, one\r\nwould not be mistaken in supposing that, though he is the lowest in order\r\nof the gods, nevertheless he is the leader of all the tribes of divine\r\nbeings. But the myth calls him a demigod to indicate the difference\r\nbetween him and the unchanging gods. He is attended by the Corybants who\r\nare assigned to him by the Mother; they are the three leading\r\npersonalities of the higher races(846) that are next in order to the gods.\r\nAlso Attis rules over the lions, who together with the Lion, who is their\r\nleader, have chosen for themselves hot and fiery substance, and so are,\r\nfirst and foremost, the cause of fire. And through the heat derived from\r\nfire they are the causes of motive force and of preservation for all other\r\nthings that exist. And Attis encircles the heavens like a tiara, and\r\nthence sets out as though to descend to earth.)\r\n\r\nΟὗτος ὁ μέγας ἡμῖν θεὸς Ἄττις ἐστίν· αὗται τοῦ βασιλέως Ἄττιδος αἱ\r\nθρηνούμεναι τέως φυγαὶ καὶ κρύψεις καὶ ἀφανισμοὶ καὶ αἱ δύσεις αἱ κατὰ τὸ\r\nἄντρον. τεκμήρια δὲ ἔστω μοι τούτου ὁ χρόνος, ἐν ᾧ γίνεται. τέμνεσθαι γάρ\r\nφασι τὸ ἱερὸν δένδρον καθ᾽ ἣν ἡμέραν ὁ ἥλιος ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ἰσημερινῆς\r\nἁψῖδος ἔρχεται· εἶθ᾽ ἑξῆς περισαλπισμὸς παραλαμβάνεται· [D] τῇ τρίτῃ δὲ\r\nτέμνεται τὸ ἱερὸν καὶ ἀπόρρητον θέρος τοῦ θεοῦ Γάλλου· ἐπὶ τούτοις Ἱλάρια,\r\nφασί, καὶ ἑορταί. ὅτι μὲν οὖν στάσις ἐστὶ τῆς ἀπειρίας ἡ θρυλουμένη παρὰ\r\nτοῖς πολλοῖς ἐκτομή, πρόδηλον ἐξ ὧν ἡνίκα ὁ μέγας Ἥλιος τοῦ ἰσημερινοῦ\r\nψαύσας κύκλου, ἵνα τὸ μάλιστα ὡρισμένον ἐστί·(847) τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἴσον\r\nὡρισμένον ἐστί, τὸ δὲ ἄνισον ἄπειρόν τε καὶ ἀδιεξίτητον· κατὰ τὸν λόγον\r\nαὐτίκα τὸ δένδρον τέμνεται· [169] εἶθ᾽ ἑξῆς γίνεται τὰ λοιπά, τὰ μὲν διὰ\r\nτοὺς μυστικοὺς καὶ κρυφίους θεσμούς, τὰ δὲ καὶ διὰ(848) ῥηθῆναι πᾶσι\r\nδυναμένους. ἡ δὲ ἐκτομὴ τοῦ δένδρου, τοῦτο δὲ τῇ μὲν ἱστορίᾳ προσήκει τῇ\r\nπερὶ τὸν Γάλλον, οὐδὲν δὲ τοῖς μυστηρίοις, οἷς παραλαμβάνεται, διδασκόντων\r\nἡμᾶς οἶμαι τῶν θεῶν συμβολικῶς, ὅτι χρὴ τὸ κάλλιστον ἐκ γῆς δρεψαμένους,\r\nἀρετὴν μετὰ εὐσεβείας, ἀπενεγκεῖν τῇ θεῷ, σύμβολον τῆς ἐνταῦθα χρηστῆς\r\nπολιτείας ἐσόμενον. τὸ γάρ τοι δένδρον ἐκ [B] γῆς μὲν φύεται, σπεύδει δὲ\r\nὥσπερ εἰς τὸν αἰθέρα καὶ ἰδεῖν τέ ἐστι καλὸν καὶ σκιὰν παρασχεῖν ἐν\r\nπνίγει, ἤδη δὲ καὶ καρπὸν ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ προβαλεῖν καὶ χαρίσασθαι· οὗτως αὐτῷ\r\nπολύ τί γε τοῦ γονίμου περίεστιν. ἡμῖν οὖν ὁ θεσμὸς παρακελεύεται, τοῖς\r\nφύσει μὲν οὐρανίοις, εἰς γῆν δὲ ἐνεχθεῖσιν, ἀρετὴν μετὰ εὐσεβείας ἀπὸ τῆς\r\nἐν τῇ γῇ πολιτείας ἀμησαμένους παρὰ τὴν προγονικὴν [C] καὶ ζωογόνον\r\nσπεύδειν θεόν.\r\n\r\n(This, then, is our mighty god Attis. This explains his once lamented\r\nflight and concealment and disappearance and descent into the cave. In\r\nproof of this let me cite the time of year at which it happens. For we are\r\ntold that the sacred tree(849) is felled on the day when the sun reaches\r\nthe height of the equinox.(850) Thereupon the trumpets are sounded.(851)\r\nAnd on the third day the sacred and unspeakable member of the god Gallus\r\nis severed.(852) Next comes, they say, the Hilaria(853) and the festival.\r\nAnd that this castration, so much discussed by the crowd, is really the\r\nhalting of his unlimited course, is evident from what happens directly\r\nmighty Helios touches the cycle of the equinox, where the bounds are most\r\nclearly defined. (For the even is bounded, but the uneven is without\r\nbounds, and there is no way through or out of it.) At that time then,\r\nprecisely, according to the account we have, the sacred tree is felled.\r\nThereupon, in their proper order, all the other ceremonies take place.\r\nSome of them are celebrated with the secret ritual of the Mysteries, but\r\nothers by a ritual that can be told to all. For instance, the cutting of\r\nthe tree belongs to the story of Gallus and not to the Mysteries at all,\r\nbut it has been taken over by them, I think because the gods wished to\r\nteach us, in symbolic fashion, that we must pluck the fairest fruits from\r\nthe earth, namely, virtue and piety, and offer them to the goddess to be\r\nthe symbol of our well‐ordered constitution here on earth. For the tree\r\ngrows from the soil, but it strives upwards as though to reach the upper\r\nair, and it is fair to behold and gives us shade in the heat, and casts\r\nbefore us and bestows on us its fruits as a boon; such is its\r\nsuperabundance of generative life. Accordingly the ritual enjoins on us,\r\nwho by nature belong to the heavens but have fallen to earth, to reap the\r\nharvest of our constitution here on earth, namely, virtue and piety, and\r\nthen strive upwards to the goddess of our forefathers, to her who is the\r\nprinciple of all life.)\r\n\r\nΕὐθὺς οὖν ἡ σάλπιγξ μετὰ τὴν ἐκτομὴν ἐνδίδωσι τὸ ἀνακλητικὸν τῷ Ἄττιδι καὶ\r\nτοῖς ὅσοι ποτὲ οὐρανόθεν ἔπτημεν εἰς τὴν γῆν καὶ ἐπέσομεν. μετὰ δὴ τὸ\r\nσύμβολον τοῦτο, ὅτε ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἄττις ἵστησι τὴν ἀπειρίαν διὰ τῆς ἐκτομῆς,\r\nἡμῖν οἱ θεοὶ κελεύουσιν ἐκτέμνειν καὶ αὐτοῖς τὴν ἐν ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς ἀπειρίαν\r\nκαὶ μιμεῖσθαι τοὺς ἡγεμόνας,(854) ἐπὶ δὲ τὸ ὡρισμένον καὶ ἑνοειδὲς καί,\r\nεἴπερ οἷόν τέ ἐστιν, [D] αὐτὸ τὸ ἓν ἀνατρέχειν· οὗπερ γενομένου πάντως\r\nἕπεσθαι χρὴ τὰ Ἱλάρια. τί γὰρ εὐθυμότερον, τί δὲ ἱλαρώτερον γένοιτο ἂν\r\nψυχῆς ἀπειρίαν μὲν καὶ γένεσιν καὶ τὸν ἐν αὐτῇ κλύδωνα διαφυγούσης, ἐπὶ δὲ\r\nτοὺς θεοὺς αὐτοὺς ἀναχθείσης; ὧν ἕνα καὶ τὸν Ἄττιν ὄντα περιεῖδεν οὐδαμῶς\r\nἡ τῶν θεῶν Μήτηρ βαδίζοντα πρόσω πλέον ἢ χρῆν, πρὸς ἑαυτὴν δὲ ἐπέστρεψε,\r\nστῆσαι τὴν ἀπειρίαν προστάξασα.\r\n\r\n(Therefore, immediately after the castration, the trumpet sounds the\r\nrecall for Attis and for all of us who once flew down from heaven and fell\r\nto earth. And after this signal, when King Attis stays his limitless\r\ncourse by his castration, the god bids us also root out the unlimited in\r\nourselves and imitate the gods our leaders and hasten back to the defined\r\nand uniform, and, if it be possible, to the One itself. After this, the\r\nHilaria must by all means follow. For what could be more blessed, what\r\nmore joyful than a soul which has escaped from limitlessness and\r\ngeneration and inward storm, and has been translated up to the very gods?\r\nAnd Attis himself was such a one, and the Mother of the Gods by no means\r\nallowed him to advance unregarded further than was permitted: nay, she\r\nmade him turn towards herself, and commanded him to set a limit to his\r\nlimitless course.)\r\n\r\nΚαὶ μή τις ὑπολάβῃ με λέγειν, ὡς ταῦτα ἐπράχθη ποτέ καὶ γέγονεν, [170]\r\nὥσπερ οὐκ εἰδότων τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν, ὅ, τι ποιήσουσιν, ἢ τὰ σφῶν αὐτῶν\r\nἁμαρτήματα διορθουμένων. ἀλλὰ οἱ παλαιοὶ τῶν ὄντων ἀεὶ τὰς αἰτίας, ἤτοι\r\nτῶν θεῶν ὑφηγουμένων ἢ κατὰ σφᾶς αὐτοὺς διερευνώμενοι, βέλτιον δὲ ἴσως\r\nεἰπεῖν ζητοῦντες ὑφ᾽ ἡγεμόσι τοῖς θεοῖς, ἔπειτα εὑρόντες ἐσκέπασαν\r\nαὐτὰς(855) μύθοις παραδόξοις, ἵνα διὰ τοῦ παραδόξου καὶ ἀπεμφαίνοντος τὸ\r\nπλάσμα φωραθὲν ἐπὶ τὴν ζήτησιν ἡμᾶς τῆς [B] ἀληθείας προτρέψῃ, τοῖς μὲν\r\nἰδιώταις ἀρκούσης οἶμαι τῆς ἀλόγου καὶ διὰ τῶν συμβόλων μόνων ὠφελείας,\r\nτοῖς δὲ περιττοῖς κατὰ τὴν φρόνησιν οὕτως μόνως ἐσομένης ὠφελίμου τῆς περὶ\r\nθεῶν ἀληθείας, εἴ τις ἐξετάζων αὐτὴν ὑφ᾽ ἡγεμόσι τοῖς θεοῖς εὕροι καὶ\r\nλάβοι, διὰ μὲν τῶν αἰνιγμάτων ὑπομνησθείς, ὅτι χρή τι περὶ αὐτῶν ζητεῖν,\r\nἐς τέλος δὲ καὶ ὥσπερ κορυφὴν τοῦ πράγματος διὰ τῆς σκέψεως εὑρὼν\r\nπορευθείη, [C] οὐκ αἰδοῖ καὶ πίστει μᾶλλον ἀλλοτρίας δόξης ἢ τῆς σφετέρᾳ\r\nκατὰ νοῦν ἐνεργείᾳ.\r\n\r\n(But let no one suppose my meaning to be that this was ever done or\r\nhappened in a way that implies that the gods themselves are ignorant of\r\nwhat they intend to do, or that they have to correct their own errors. But\r\nour ancestors in every case tried to trace the original meanings of\r\nthings, whether with the guidance of the gods or independently—though\r\nperhaps it would be better to say that they sought for them under the\r\nleadership of the gods—then when they had discovered those meanings they\r\nclothed them in paradoxical myths. This was in order that, by means of the\r\nparadox and the incongruity, the fiction might be detected and we might be\r\ninduced to search out the truth. Now I think ordinary men derive benefit\r\nenough from the irrational myth which instructs them through symbols\r\nalone. But those who are more highly endowed with wisdom will find the\r\ntruth about the gods helpful; though only on condition that such a man\r\nexamine and discover and comprehend it under the leadership of the gods,\r\nand if by such riddles as these he is reminded that he must search out\r\ntheir meaning, and so attains to the goal and summit of his quest(856)\r\nthrough his own researches; he must not be modest and put faith in the\r\nopinions of others rather than in his own mental powers.)\r\n\r\nΤί οὖν εἶναί φαμεν, ὡς ἐν κεφαλαίῳ; κατανοήσαντες ἄχρι τοῦ πέμπτου σώματος\r\nοὐ τὸ νοητὸν μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ φαινόμενα ταῦτα σώματα τῆς ἀπαθοῦς ὄντα\r\nκαὶ θείας μερίδος, ἄχρι τούτου θεοὺς ἐνόμισαν ἀκραιφνεῖς εἶναι· τῇ γονίμῳ\r\nδὲ τῶν θεῶν οὐσίᾳ τῶν τῇδε παρυποστάντων, ἐξ ἀιδίου συμπροελθούσης τῆς\r\nὕλης τοῖς θεοῖς, [D] παρ᾽ αὐτῶν δὲ καὶ δι᾽ αὐτῶν διὰ τὸ ὑπέρπληρες αὐτῶν\r\nτῆς γονίμου καὶ δημιουργικῆς αἰτίας ἡ των ὄντων προμήθεια συνουσιωμένη\r\nτοῖς θεοῖς ἐξ ἀιδίου, καὶ σύνθωκος μὲν οὖσα τῷ βασιλεῖ Διί, πηγὴ δὲ τῶν\r\nνοερῶν θεῶν, καὶ τὸ δοκοῦν ἄζωον καὶ ἄγονον καὶ σκύβαλον καὶ τῶν ὄντων,\r\nοἷον ἂν εἴποι τις, ἀποκάθαρμα καὶ τρύγα καὶ ὑποσταθμὴν διὰ τῆς τελευταίας\r\nαἰτίας(857) τῶν θεῶν, εἰς ἣν αἱ πάντων οὐσίαι τῶν θεῶν ἀποτελευτῶσιν,\r\nἐκόσμησέ τε καὶ διωρθώσατο καὶ πρὸς τὸ κρεῖττον μετέστησεν.\r\n\r\n(What shall I say now by way of summary? Because men observed that, as far\r\nas the fifth substance, not only the intelligible world but also the\r\nvisible bodies of our world must be classed as unaffected by externals and\r\ndivine, they believed that, as far as the fifth substance, the gods are\r\nuncompounded. And when by means of that generative substance the visible\r\ngods came into being, and, from everlasting, matter was produced along\r\nwith those gods, from them and through their agency, by reason of the\r\nsuperabundance in them of the generative and creative principle; then the\r\nProvidence of the world, she who from everlasting is of the same essential\r\nnature as the gods, she who is enthroned by the side of King Zeus, and\r\nmoreover is the source of the intellectual gods, set in order and\r\ncorrected and changed for the better all that seemed lifeless and barren,\r\nthe refuse and so to speak offscourings of things, their dregs and\r\nsediment: and this she did by means of the last cause(858) derived from\r\nthe gods, in which the substances of all the gods come to an end.)\r\n\r\n[171] Ὁ γὰρ Ἄττις οὗτος ἔχων τὴν κατάστικτον τοῖς ἄστροις τιάραν εὔδηλον\r\nὅτι τὰς πάντων τῶν θεῶν εἰς τὸν ἐμφανῆ κόσμον ὁρωμένας λήξεις ἀρχὰς\r\nἐποιήσατο τῆς ἑαυτοῦ βασιλείας· ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ τὸ μὲν ἀκραιφνὲς καὶ καθαρὸν ῾ἦν\r\nἄχρι γαλαξίου· περὶ τοῦτον δὲ ἤδη τὸν τόπον μιγνυμένου πρὸς τὸ ἀπαθὲς τοῦ\r\nπαθητοῦ καὶ τῆς ὕλης παρυφισταμένης ἐκεῖθεν, ἡ πρὸς ταύτην κοινωνία\r\nκατάβασίς ἐστιν εἰς τὸ ἄντρον, [B] οὐκ ἀκουσίως μὲν γενομένη τοῖς θεοῖς\r\nκαὶ τῇ τούτων Μητρί, λεγομένη δὲ ἀκουσίως γενέσθαι. φύσει γὰρ ἐν κρείττονι\r\nτοὺς θεοὺς ὄντας οὐκ ἐκεῖθεν ἐπὶ τάδε καθέλκειν ἐθέλει τὰ βελτίω, ἀλλὰ διὰ\r\nτῆς τῶν κρειττόνων συγκαταβάσεως καὶ ταῦτα ἀνάγειν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀμείνονα καὶ\r\nθεοφιλεστέραν λῆξιν. οὕτω τοι καὶ τὸν Ἄττιν οὐ κατεχθραίνουσα μετὰ τὴν\r\nἐκτομὴν ἡ Μήτηρ λέγεται, ἀλλὰ ἀγανακτεῖ μὲν οὐκέτι, ἀγανακτοῦσα δὲ λέγεται\r\nδιὰ τὴν συγκατάβασιν, ὅτι κρείττων ὢν [C] καὶ θεὸς ἔδωκεν ἑαυτὸν τῷ\r\nκαταδεεστέρῳ· στήσαντα δὲ αὐτὸν τῆς ἀπειρίας τὴν πρόοδον καὶ τὸ ἀκόσμητον\r\nτοῦτο κοσμήσαντα διὰ τῆς πρὸς τὸν ἰσημερινὸν κύκλον συμπαθείας, ἵνα ὁ\r\nμέγας Ἥλιος τῆς ὡρισμένης κινήσεως τὸ τελειότατον κυβερνᾷ μέτρον, ἐπανάγει\r\nπρὸς ἑαυτὴν ἡ θεὸς ἀσμένως, μᾶλλον δὲ ἔχει παρ᾽ ἑαυτῇ. καὶ οὐδέποτε\r\nγέγονεν, ὅτε μὴ ταῦτα τοῦτον εἶχε τὸν τρόπον, ὅνπερ νῦν ἔχει, ἀλλ᾽ ἀεὶ μὲν\r\nἌττις ἐστὶν ὑπουργὸς τῇ Μητρὶ [D] καὶ ἡνίοχος, ἀεὶ δὲ ὀργᾷ εἰς τὴν\r\nγένεσιν, ἀεὶ δὲ ἀποτέμνεται τὴν ἀπειρίαν διὰ τῆς ὡρισμένης τῶν εἰδῶν\r\nαἰτίας. ἐπαναγόμενος δὲ ὥσπερ ἐκ γῆς τῶν ἀρχαίων αὖθις λέγεται δυναστεύειν\r\nσκήπτρων, ἐκπεσὼν μὲν αὐτῶν οὐδαμῶς οὐδὲ ἐκπίπτων, ἐκπεσεῖν δὲ αὐτῶν\r\nλεγόμενος διὰ τὴν πρὸς τὸ παθητὸν σύμμιξιν.\r\n\r\n(For it is evident that Attis of whom I speak, who wears the tiara set\r\nwith stars, took for the foundation of his own dominion the functions of\r\nevery god as we see them applied to the visible world. And in his case all\r\nis undefiled and pure as far as the Milky Way. But, at this very point,\r\nthat which is troubled by passion begins to mingle with the passionless,\r\nand from that union matter begins to subsist. And so the association of\r\nAttis with matter is the descent into the cave, nor did this take place\r\nagainst the will of the gods and the Mother of the Gods, though the myth\r\nsays that it was against their will. For by their nature the gods dwell in\r\na higher world, and the higher powers do not desire to drag them hence\r\ndown to our world: rather through the condescension of the higher they\r\ndesire to lead the things of our earth upwards to a higher plane more\r\nfavoured by the gods. And in fact the myth does not say that the Mother of\r\nthe Gods was hostile to Attis after his castration: but it says that\r\nthough she is no longer angry, she was angry at the time on account of his\r\ncondescension, in that he who was a higher being and a god had given\r\nhimself to that which was inferior. But when, after staying his limitless\r\nprogress, he has set in order the chaos of our world through his sympathy\r\nwith the cycle of the equinox, where mighty Helios controls the most\r\nperfect symmetry of his motion within due limits, then the goddess gladly\r\nleads him upwards to herself, or rather keeps him by her side. And never\r\ndid this happen save in the manner that it happens now; but forever is\r\nAttis the servant and charioteer of the Mother; forever he yearns\r\npassionately towards generation; and forever he cuts short his unlimited\r\ncourse through the cause whose limits are fixed, even the cause of the\r\nforms. In like manner the myth says that he is led upwards as though from\r\nour earth, and again resumes his ancient sceptre and dominion: not that he\r\never lost it, or ever loses it now, but the myth says that he lost it on\r\naccount of his union with that which is subject to passion and change.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἐκεῖνο ἴσως ἄξιον προσαπορῆσαι· διττῆς γὰρ οὔσης τῆς ἰσημερίας, [172]\r\nοὐ τὴν ἐν ταῖς χηλαῖς, τὴν δὲ ἐν τῷ κριῷ προτιμῶσι. τίς οὖν αἰτία τούτου,\r\nφανερὸν δήπουθεν. ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἡμῖν ὁ ἥλιος ἄρχεται τότε πλησιάζειν ἀπὸ τῆς\r\nἰσημερίας, αὐξομένης οἶμαι τῆς ἡμέρας, ἔδοξεν οὗτος ὁ καιρὸς ἁρμοδιώτερος.\r\nἔξω γὰρ τῆς αἰτίας, ἥ φησι τοῖς θεοῖς εἶναι τὸ φῶς σύνδρομον, ἔχειν\r\nοἰκείως πιστευτέον τοῖς ἀφεθῆναι τῆς γενέσεως σπεύδουσι τὰς ἀναγωγοὺς\r\nἀκτῖνας ἡλίου.

There\r\nare two equinoxes, but men pay more honour to the equinox in the sign of\r\nCapricorn than to that in the sign of Cancer.(862) Surely the reason for\r\nthis is evident. Since the sun begins to approach us immediately after the\r\nspring equinox,—for I need not say that then the days begin to\r\nlengthen,—this seemed the more agreeable season. For apart from the\r\nexplanation which says that light accompanies the gods, we must believe\r\nthat the uplifting rays(863) of the sun are nearly akin to those who yearn\r\nto be set free from generation. Consider it clearly: the sun, by his\r\nvivifying and marvellous heat, draws up all things from the earth and\r\ncalls them forth and makes them grow; and he separates, I think, all\r\ncorporeal things to the utmost degree of tenuity, and makes things weigh\r\nlight that naturally have a tendency to sink. We ought then to make these\r\nvisible things proofs of his unseen powers. For if among corporeal things\r\nhe can bring this about through his material heat, how should he not draw\r\nand lead upwards the souls of the blessed by the agency of the invisible,\r\nwholly immaterial, divine and pure substance which resides in his rays? We\r\nhave seen then that this light is nearly akin to the god, and to those who\r\nyearn to mount upwards, and moreover, that this light increases in our\r\nworld, so that when Helios begins to enter the sign of Capricorn the day\r\nbecomes longer than the night. It has also been demonstrated that the\r\ngod’s rays are by nature uplifting; and this is due to his energy, both\r\nvisible and invisible, by which very many souls have been lifted up out of\r\nthe region of the senses, because they were guided by that sense which is\r\nclearest of all and most nearly like the sun. For when with our eyes we\r\nperceive the sun’s light, not only is it welcome and useful for our lives,\r\nbut also, as the divine Plato said when he sang its praises, it is our\r\nguide to wisdom. And if I should also touch on the secret teaching of the\r\nMysteries in which the Chaldean,(864) divinely frenzied, celebrated the\r\nGod of the Seven Rays, that god through whom he lifts up the souls of men,\r\nI should be saying what is unintelligible, yea wholly unintelligible to\r\nthe common herd, but familiar to the happy theurgists.(865) And so I will\r\nfor the present be silent on that subject.)\r\n\r\nὍπερ δὲ ἔλεγον, ὅτι καὶ τὸν καιρὸν οὐκ ἀλόγως ὑποληπτέον, ἀλλ᾽ ὡς ἔνι\r\nμάλιστα μετὰ εἰκότος καὶ ἀληθοῦς λόγου παρὰ τῶν παλαιῶν τῷ θεσμῷ\r\nπροστεθεῖσθαι, σημεῖον δὴ(866) τούτου, ὅτι τὸν ἰσημερινὸν κύκλον ἡ θεὸς\r\nαὐτὴ(867) κατενείματο. τελεῖται γὰρ περὶ τὸν ζυγὸν Δηοῖ καὶ Κόρῃ τὰ σεμνὰ\r\nκαὶ ἀπόρρητα μυστήρια.

For\r\nthe most holy and secret Mysteries of Deo and the Maiden(869) are\r\ncelebrated when the sun is in the sign of Libra, and this is quite\r\nnatural. For when the gods depart we must consecrate ourselves afresh, so\r\nthat we may suffer no harm from the godless power of darkness that now\r\nbegins to get the upper hand. At any rate the Athenians celebrate the\r\nMysteries of Deo twice in the year, and the Lesser Mysteries as they call\r\nthem in the sign of Capricorn, and the Great Mysteries when the sun is in\r\nthe sign of Cancer, and this for the reason that I have just mentioned.\r\nAnd I think that these Mysteries are called Great and Lesser for several\r\nreasons, but especially, as is natural, they are called great when the god\r\ndeparts rather than when he approaches; and so the Lesser are celebrated\r\nonly by way of reminder.(870) I mean that when the saving and uplifting\r\ngod approaches, the preliminary rites of the Mysteries take place. Then a\r\nlittle later follow the rites of purification, one after another, and the\r\nconsecration of the priests. Then when the god departs to the antipodes,\r\nthe most important ceremonies of the Mysteries are performed, for our\r\nprotection and salvation. And observe the following: As in the festival of\r\nthe Mother the instrument of generation is severed, so too with the\r\nAthenians, those who take part in the secret rites are wholly chaste and\r\ntheir leader the hierophant forswears generation; because he must not have\r\naught to do with the progress to the unlimited, but only with the\r\nsubstance whose bounds are fixed, so that it abides for ever and is\r\ncontained in the One, stainless and pure. On this subject I have said\r\nenough.)\r\n\r\nΛείπεται δὴ λοιπόν, ὡς εἰκός, ὑπέρ τε τῆς ἁγιστείας αὐτῆς καὶ τῆς ἁγνείας\r\nδιεξελθεῖν, ἵνα καὶ ἐντεῦθεν λάβωμεν [174] εἰς τὴν ὑπόθεσιν εἴ τι\r\nσυμβάλλεται. γελοῖον δὲ αὐτίκα τοῖς πᾶσιν ἐκεῖνο φαίνεται· κρεῶν μὲν\r\nἅπτεσθαι δίδωσιν ὁ ἱερὸς νόμος, ἀπαγορεύει δὲ τῶν σπερμάτων. οὐκ ἄψυχα μὲν\r\nἐκεῖνα, ταῦτα δὲ ἔμψυχα; οὐ καθαρὰ μὲν ἐκεῖνα, ταῦτα δὲ αἵματος καὶ πολλῶν\r\nἄλλων οὐκ εὐχερῶν ὄψει τε καὶ ἀκοῇ πεπληρωμένα; οὐ, τὸ μέγιστον, ἐκείνοις\r\nμὲν πρόσεστι τὸ μηδένα ἐκ τῆς ἐδωδῆς ἀδικεῖσθαι, τούτοις δὲ τὸ καταθύεσθαι\r\nκαὶ κατασφάττεσθαι τὰ ζῷα ἀλγοῦντα γε, [B] ὡς εἰκός, καὶ τρυχόμενα; ταῦτα\r\nπολλοὶ καὶ τῶν περιττῶν εἴποιεν ἄν· ἐκεῖνα δὲ ἤδη κωμῳδοῦσι καὶ τῶν\r\nἀνθρώπων οἱ δυσσεβέστατοι. τὰ μὲν ὄρμενά φασιν ἐσθίεσθαι τῶν λαχάνων,\r\nπαραιτεῖσθαι δὲ τὰς ῥίζας, ὥσπερ γογγυλίδας. καὶ σῦκα μὲν ἐσθίεσθαί φασι,\r\nῥοιὰς δὲ οὐκέτι καὶ μῆλα πρὸς τούτοις. ταῦτα ἀκηκοὼς μινυριζόντων πολλῶν\r\nπολλάκις, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸς εἰρηκὼς(871) πρότερον ἔοικα ἐγὼ μόνος ἐκ πάντων\r\nπολλὴν εἴσεσθαι τοῖς δεσπόταις θεοῖς μάλιστα μὲν ἅπασι, πρὸ τῶν ἄλλων δὲ\r\nτῇ Μητρὶ [C] τῶν θεῶν, ὥσπερ ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν, οὕτω δὲ καὶ ἐν τούτῳ\r\nχάριν, ὅτι με μὴ περιεῖδεν ὥσπερ ἐν σκότῳ πλανώμενον, ἀλλά μοι πρῶτον μὲν\r\nἐκέλευσεν ἀποκόψασθαι οὔτι κατὰ τὸ σῶμα, κατὰ δὲ τὰς ψυχικὰς ἀλόγους ὁρμὰς\r\nκαὶ κινήσεις τῇ νοερᾷ καὶ προüφεστώσῃ(872) τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν αἰτίᾳ τὰ περιττὰ\r\nκαὶ μάταια. ἐπὶ νοῦν δὲ ἔδωκεν αὕτη λόγους τινὰς ἴσως οὐκ ἀπᾴδοντας πάντη\r\n[D] τῆς ὑπὲρ θεῶν ἀληθοῦς ἅμα καὶ εὐαγοῦς ἐπιστήμης. ἀλλ᾽ ἔοικα γάρ, ὥσπερ\r\nοὐκ ἔχων ὅ τι φῶ, κύκλῳ περιτρέχειν. ἐμοὶ δὲ πάρεστι μὲν καὶ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον\r\nἐπιόντι σαφεῖς καὶ τηλαυγεῖς αἰτίας ἀποδοῦναι, τοῦ χάριν ἡμῖν οὐ θέμις\r\nἐστὶ προσφέρεσθαι ταῦτα, ὧν ὁ θεῖος εἴργει θεσμός· καὶ ποιήσω δὲ(873) αὐτὸ\r\nμικρὸν ὕστερον· ἄμεινον δὲ νῦν ὥσπερ τύπους τινὰς προθεῖναι καὶ κανόνας,\r\nοἷς ἑπόμενοι, κἄν τι πολλάκις ὑπὸ τῆς σπουδῆς παρέλθῃ τὸν λόγον, ἕξομεν\r\nὑπὲρ τούτων κρῖναι.\r\n\r\n(It only remains now to speak, as is fitting, about the sacred rite\r\nitself, and the purification, so that from these also I may borrow\r\nwhatever contributes to my argument. For example, everyone thinks that the\r\nfollowing is ridiculous. The sacred ordinance allows men to eat meat, but\r\nit forbids them to eat grains and fruits. What, say they, are not the\r\nlatter lifeless, whereas the former was once possessed of life? Are not\r\nfruits pure, whereas meat is full of blood and of much else that offends\r\neye and ear? But most important of all is it not the case that, when one\r\neats fruit nothing is hurt, while the eating of meat involves the\r\nsacrifice and slaughter of animals who naturally suffer pain and torment?\r\nSo would say many even of the wisest. But the following ordinance is\r\nridiculed by the most impious of mankind also. They observe that whereas\r\nvegetables that grows upwards can be eaten, roots are forbidden, turnips,\r\nfor instance; and they point out that figs are allowed, but not\r\npomegranates or apples either. I have often heard many men saying this in\r\nwhispers, and I too in former days have said the same, but now it seems\r\nthat I alone of all men am bound to be deeply grateful to the ruling gods,\r\nto all of them, surely, but above all the rest to the Mother of the Gods.\r\nFor all things am I grateful to her, and for this among the rest, that she\r\ndid not disregard me when I wandered as it were in darkness.(874) For\r\nfirst she bade me cut off no part indeed of my body, but by the aid of the\r\nintelligible cause(875) that subsists prior to our souls, all that was\r\nsuperfluous and vain in the impulses and motions of my own soul. And that\r\ncause gave me, to aid my understanding, certain beliefs which are perhaps\r\nnot wholly out of harmony with the true and sacred knowledge of the gods.\r\nBut it looks as though, not knowing what to say next, I were turning round\r\nin a circle. I can, however, give clear and manifest reasons in every\r\nsingle case why we are not allowed to eat this food which is forbidden by\r\nthe sacred ordinance, and presently I will do this. But for the moment it\r\nis better to bring forward certain forms, so to speak, and regulations\r\nwhich we must observe in order to be able to decide about these matters,\r\nthough perhaps, owing to my haste, my argument may pass some evidence by.)\r\n\r\n[175] Προσήκει δὲ πρῶτον ὑπομνῆσαι διὰ βραχέων, τίνα τε ἔφαμεν εἶναι τὸν\r\nἌττιν καὶ τί τὴν ἐκτομήν, τίνος τε εἶναι σύμβολα τὰ μετὰ τὴν ἐκτομὴν ἄχρι\r\nτῶν Ἱλαρίων γινόμενα καὶ τί βούλεσθαι τὴν ἁγνείαν. ὁ μὲν οὖν Ἄττις ἐλέγετο\r\nαἰτία τις οὖσα καὶ θεός, ὁ προσεχῶς δημιουργῶν τὸν ἔνυλον κόσμον, ὃς μέχρι\r\nτῶν ἐσχάτων κατιὼν ἵσταται ὑπὸ τῆς ἡλίου δημιουργικῆς κινήσεως, ὅταν ἐπὶ\r\nτῆς ἄκρως [B] ὡρισμένης τοῦ παντὸς ὁ θεὸς γένηται περιφερείας, ᾗ(876) τῆς\r\nἰσημερίας τοὔνομά ἐστι κατὰ τὸ ἔργον. ἐκτομὴν δὲ ἐλέγομεν εἶναι τῆς\r\nἀπειρίας τὴν ἐποχήν, ἣν οὐκ ἄλλως ἢ διὰ τῆς ἑπὶ τὰς πρεσβυτέρας καὶ\r\nἀρχηγικωτέρας αἰτίας ἀνακλήσεώς τε καὶ ἀναδύσεως συμβαίνειν. αὐτῆς δὲ τῆς\r\nἁγνείας φαμὲν τὸν σκοπὸν ἄνοδον τῶν ψυχῶν.\r\n\r\n(First I had better remind you in a few words who I said Attis is; and\r\nwhat his castration means; and what is symbolised by the ceremonies that\r\noccur between the castration and the Hilaria; and what is meant by the\r\nrite of purification. Attis then was declared to be an original cause and\r\na god, the direct creator of the material world, who descends to the\r\nlowest limits and is checked by the creative motion of the sun so soon as\r\nthat god reaches the exactly limited circuit of the universe, which is\r\ncalled the equinox because of its effect in equalising night and day.(877)\r\nAnd I said that the castration meant the checking of limitlessness, which\r\ncould only be brought about through the summons and resurrection of Attis\r\nto the more venerable and commanding causes. And I said that the end and\r\naim of the rite of purification is the ascent of our souls.)\r\n\r\nΟὐκοῦν οὐκ ἐᾷ πρῶτον σιτεῖσθαι τὰ κατὰ γῆς δυόμενα σπέρματα· ἔσχατον μὲν\r\nγὰρ τῶν ὄντων ἡ γῆ. ἐνταῦθα δέ φησιν ἀπελαθέντα καὶ Πλάτων τὰ κακὰ\r\nστρέφεσθαι, καὶ διὰ τῶν λογίων οἱ θεοὶ σκύβαλον αὐτὸ πολλαχοῦ καλοῦσι, [C]\r\nκαὶ φεύγειν ἐντεῦθεν παρακελεύονται.(878) πρῶτον οὖν ἡ ζωογόνος καὶ\r\nπρομηθὴς θεὸς οὐδὲ ἄχρι τῆς τῶν σωμάτων τροφῆς ἐπιτρέπει τοῖς κατὰ γῆς\r\nδυομένοις χρῆσθαι, παραινοῦσά γε πρὸς τὸν οὐρανόν, μᾶλλον δὲ καὶ ὑπὲρ τὸν\r\nοὐρανὸν βλέπειν. ἑνί τινες κέχρηνται σπέρματι, τοῖς λοβοῖς, οὐ σπέρμα\r\nμᾶλλον ἢ λάχανον αὐτὸ νομίζοντες [D] εἶναι τῷ πεφυκέναι πως ἀνωφερὲς καὶ\r\nὀρθὸν καὶ οὐδὲ ἐρριζῶσθαι κατὰ τῆς γῆς· ἐρρίζωται δὲ ὥσπερ ἐκ δένδρου\r\nκιττοῦ τινος ἢ καὶ ἀμπέλου καρπὸς ἤρτηται καὶ καλάμης.(879) ἀπηγόρευται\r\nμὲν οὖν ἡμῖν σπέρματι χρῆσθαι διὰ τοῦτο φυτῶν, ἐπιτέτραπται δὲ χρῆσθαι\r\nκαρποῖς καὶ λαχάνοις, οὐ τοῖς χαμαιζήλοις, ἀλλὰ τοῖς ἐκ γῆς αἰρομένοις ἄνω\r\nμετεώροις. ταύτῃ τοι καὶ τῆς γογγυλίδος τὸ μὲν γεωχαρὲς ὡς χθόνιον\r\nἐπιτάττει παραιτεῖσθαι, [176] τὸ δὲ ἀναδυόμενον ἄνω καὶ εἰς ὕψος αἰρόμενον\r\nὡς αὐτῷ τούτῳ καθαρὸν τυγχάνον δίδωσι προσένεγκασθαι. τῶν γοῦν λαχάνων\r\nὀρμένοις μὲν συγχωρεῖ χρῆσθαι, ῥίζαις δὲ ἀπαγορεύει καὶ μάλιστα ταῖς\r\nἐντρεφομέναις καὶ συμπαθούσαις τῇ γῇ. καὶ μὴν καὶ τῶν δένδρων μῆλα μὲν ὡς\r\nἱερὰ καὶ χρυσᾶ καὶ ἀρρήτων ἄθλων καὶ τελεστικῶν εἰκόνας καταφθείρειν οὐκ\r\nἐπέτρεψε καὶ καταναλίσκειν, ἄξιά γε ἄντα τῶν ἀρχετύπων χάριν τοῦ σέβεσθαί\r\nτε καὶ θεραπεύεσθαι· [B] ῥοιὰς δὲ ὡς φυτὸν χθόνιον παρῃτήσατο, καὶ τοῦ\r\nφοίνικος δὲ τὸν καρπὸν ἴσως μὲν ἄν τις εἴποι διὰ τὸ μὴ γίνεσθαι περὶ τὴν\r\nΦρυγίαν, ἔνθα πρῶτον ὁ θεσμὸς κατέστη· ἐμοὶ δὲ δοκεῖ μᾶλλον ὡς ἱερὸν ἡλίου\r\nτὸ φυτὸν ἀγήρων τε ὂν οὐ συγχωρῆσαι καταναλίσκειν ἐν ταῖς ἀγιστείαις εἰς\r\nτροφὴν σώματος. ἐπὶ τούτοις ἀπηγόρευται ἰχθύσιν ἅπασι χρῆσθαι. κοινὸν δέ\r\nἐστι τοῦτο [C] καὶ πρὸς Αἰγυπτίους τὸ πρόβλημα. δοκεῖ δὲ ἔμοιγε δυοῖν\r\nἕνεκεν ἄν τις ἰχθύων μάλιστα μὲν ἀεί, πάντως δὲ ἐν ταῖς ἁγιστείαις\r\nἀποσχέσθαι, ἑνὸς μέν, ὅτι τούτων, ἃ μὴ θύομεν τοῖς θεοῖς, οὐδὲ σιτεῖσθαι\r\nπροσήκει. δέος δὲ ἴσως οὐδέν, μή πού τις ἐνταῦθα λίχνος καὶ γάστρις\r\nἐπιλάβηταί μου, ὥς που καὶ πρότερον ἤδη παθὼν αὐτὸ διαμνημονεύω, “Διὰ τί\r\nδέ; οὐχὶ καὶ θύομεν αὐτῶν πολλάκις τοῖς θεοῖς”; εἰπόντος ἀκούσας. ἀλλ᾽\r\nεἴχομέν τι καὶ πρὸς τοῦτο εἰπεῖν.

For the earth is the last and lowest of\r\nthings. And Plato also says(882) that evil, exiled from the gods, now\r\nmoves on earth; and in the oracles the gods often call the earth refuse,\r\nand exhort us to escape thence. And so, in the first place, the life‐\r\ngenerating god who is our providence does not allow us to use to nourish\r\nour bodies fruits that grow under the earth; and thereby enjoins that we\r\nturn our eyes towards the heavens, or rather above the heavens.(883) One\r\nkind of fruit of the earth, however, some people do eat, I mean fruit in\r\npods, because they regard this as a vegetable rather than a fruit, since\r\nit grows with a sort of upward tendency and is upright, and not rooted\r\nbelow the soil; I mean that it is rooted like the fruit of the ivy that\r\nhangs on a tree or of the vine that hangs on a stem. For this reason then\r\nwe are forbidden to eat seeds and certain plants, but we are allowed to\r\neat fruit and vegetables, only not those that creep on the ground, but\r\nthose that are raised up from the earth and hang high in the air. It is\r\nsurely for this reason that the ordinance bids us also avoid that part of\r\nthe turnip which inclines to the earth since it belongs to the under\r\nworld, but allows us to eat that part which grows upwards and attains to\r\nsome height, since by that very fact it is pure. In fact it allows us to\r\neat any vegetables that grow upwards, but forbids us roots, and especially\r\nthose which are nourished in and influenced by the earth. Moreover in the\r\ncase of trees it does not allow us to destroy and consume apples, for\r\nthese are sacred and golden and are the symbols of secret and mystical\r\nrewards. Rather are they worthy to be reverenced and worshipped for the\r\nsake of their archetypes. And pomegranates are forbidden because they\r\nbelong to the under‐world; and the fruit of the date‐palm, perhaps one\r\nmight say because the date‐palm does not grow in Phrygia where the\r\nordinance was first established. But my own theory is rather that it is\r\nbecause this tree is sacred to the sun, and is perennial, that we are\r\nforbidden to use it to nourish our bodies during the sacred rites. Besides\r\nthese, the use of all kinds of fish is forbidden. This is a question of\r\ninterest to the Egyptians as well as to ourselves. Now my opinion is that\r\nfor two reasons we ought to abstain from fish, at all times if possible,\r\nbut above all during the sacred rites. One reason is that it is not\r\nfitting that we should eat what we do not use in sacrifices to the gods.\r\nAnd perhaps I need not be afraid that hereupon some greedy person who is\r\nthe slave of his belly will take me up, though as I remember that very\r\nthing happened to me once before; and then I heard someone objecting:\r\n“What do you mean? Do we not often sacrifice fish to the gods?” But I had\r\nan answer ready for this question also. “My good sir,” I said, “it is true\r\nthat we make offerings of fish in certain mystical sacrifices, just as the\r\nRomans sacrifice the horse and many other animals too, both wild and\r\ndomesticated, and as the Greeks and the Romans too sacrifice dogs to\r\nHecate. And among other nations also many other animals are offered in the\r\nmystic cults; and sacrifices of that sort take place publicly in their\r\ncities once or twice a year. But that is not the custom in the sacrifices\r\nwhich we honour most highly, in which alone the gods deign to join us and\r\nto share our table. In those most honoured sacrifices we do not offer\r\nfish, for the reason that we do not tend fish, nor look after the breeding\r\nof them, and we do not keep flocks of fish as we do of sheep and cattle.\r\nFor since we foster these animals and they multiply accordingly, it is\r\nonly right that they should serve for all our uses and above all for the\r\nsacrifices that we honour most.” This then is one reason why I think we\r\nought not to use fish for food at the time of the rite of purification.\r\nThe second reason which is, I think, even more in keeping with what I have\r\njust said, is that, since fish also, in a manner of speaking, go down into\r\nthe lowest depths, they, even more than seeds, belong to the under‐world.\r\nBut he who longs to take flight upwards and to mount aloft above this\r\natmosphere of ours, even to the highest peaks of the heavens, would do\r\nwell to abstain from all such food. He will rather pursue and follow after\r\nthings that tend upwards towards the air, and strive to the utmost height,\r\nand, if I may use a poetic phrase, look upward to the skies. Birds, for\r\nexample, we may eat, except only those few which are commonly held\r\nsacred,(884) and ordinary four‐footed animals, except the pig. This animal\r\nis banned as food during the sacred rites because by its shape and way of\r\nlife, and the very nature of its substance—for its flesh is impure and\r\ncoarse—it belongs wholly to the earth. And therefore men came to believe\r\nthat it was an acceptable offering to the gods of the under‐world. For\r\nthis animal does not look up at the sky, not only because it has no such\r\ndesire, but because it is so made that it can never look upwards. These\r\nthen are the reasons that have been given by the divine ordinance for\r\nabstinence from such food as we ought to renounce. And we who comprehend\r\nshare our knowledge with those who know the nature of the gods.)\r\n\r\nὝπὲρ δὲ ὧν ἐπιτρέπει χρῆσθαι λέγομεν τοσοῦτον, ὡς οὐ πᾶσιν ἅπαντα,(885) τὸ\r\nδυνατὸν δὲ ὁ θεῖος νόμος τῇ ἀνθρωπίνῃ φύσει σκοπῶν ἐπέτρεψε χρῆσθαι\r\nτουτοισὶ τοῖς πολλοῖς, οὐχ ἵνα πᾶσι πάντες ἐξ ἀνάγκης χρησώμεθα· τοῦτο μὲν\r\nγὰρ ἴσως οὐκ εὔκολον· ἀλλ᾽ ὅπως ἐκείνῳ, ὅτῳ ἄρα πρῶτον [178] μὲν ἡ τοῦ\r\nσώματος συγχωρεῖ(886) δύναμις, εἶτά τις περιουσία συντρέχει καὶ τρίτον ἡ\r\nπροαίρεσις, ἣν ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς οὕτως ἄξιον ἐπιτείνειν, ὥστε καὶ ὑπὲρ τὴν\r\nτοῦ σώματος δύναμιν ὁρμᾶν καὶ προθυμεῖσθαι τοῖς θείοις ἀκολουθεῖν θεσμοῖς.\r\nἔστι γὰρ δὴ τοῦτο μάλιστα μὲν ἀνυσιμώτερον αὐτῇ τῇ ψυχῇ πρὸς σωτηρίαν, εἰ\r\nμείζονα λόγον αὑτῆς, [B] ἀλλὰ μὴ τοῦ σώματος τῆς ἀσφαλείας ποιήσαιτο, πρὸς\r\nδὲ καὶ αὐτὸ τὸ σῶμα μείζονος καὶ θαυμασιωτέρας φαίνεται λεληθότως τῆς\r\nὠφελείας μεταλαγχάνον. ὅταν γὰρ ἡ ψυχὴ πᾶσαν ἑαυτὴν δῷ τοῖς θεοῖς, ὅλα τὰ\r\nκαθ᾽ ἑαυτὴν ἐπιτρέψασα τοῖς κρείττοσιν, ἑπομένης οἶμαι τῆς ἁγιστείας καὶ\r\nπρό γε ταύτης τῶν θείων θεσμῶν ἡγουμένων, ὄντος οὐδενὸς λοιπὸν τοῦ\r\nἀπείργοντος καὶ ἐμποδίζοντος· πάντα γάρ ἐστιν ἐν τοῖς θεοῖς καὶ πάντα περὶ\r\nαὐτοὺς ὑφέστηκε καὶ πάντα τῶν θεῶν ἐστι πλήρη· αὐτίκα μὲν αὐταῖς ἐλλάμπει\r\nτὸ θεῖον φῶς, θεωθεῖσαι δὲ αὗται τόνον τινὰ καὶ ῥώμην ἐπιτιθέασι [C] τῷ\r\nσυμφύτῳ πνεύματι, τοῦτο δὲ ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν στομούμενον ὥσπερ καὶ κρατυνόμενον\r\nσωτηρίας ἐστιν αἴτιον ὅλῳ τῷ σώματι. τὸ δὲ ὅτι μάλιστα μὲν πάσας τὰς\r\nνόσους, εἰ δὲ μή, ὅτι τὰς πλείστας καὶ μεγίστας ἐκ τῆς τοῦ πνεύματος εἶναι\r\nτροπῆς καὶ παραφορᾶς συμβέβηκεν, οὐδεὶς ὅστις οἶμαι τῶν Ἀσκληπιαδῶν οὐ\r\nφήσει.(887) οἱ μὲν γὰρ καὶ πάσας φασίν, οἱ δὲ τὰς πλείστας καὶ μεγίστας\r\nκαὶ ἰαθῆναι χαλεπωτάτας· μαρτυρεῖ δὲ τούτοις [D] καὶ τὰ τῶν θεῶν λόγια,\r\nφημὶ δέ, ὅτι διὰ τῆς ἁγιστείας οὐχ ἡ ψυχὴ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ σώματα\r\nβοηθείας πολλῆς καὶ σωτηρίας ἀξιοῦται· σώζεσθαι γάρ σφισι καὶ τὸ “πικρᾶς\r\nὕλης περίβλημα βρότειον” οἱ θεοὶ τοῖς ὑπεράγνοις παρακελευόμενοι τῶν\r\nθεουργῶν κατεπαγγέλλονται.\r\n\r\n(And to the question what food is permitted I will only say this. The\r\ndivine law does not allow all kinds of food to all men, but takes into\r\naccount what is possible to human nature and allows us to eat most\r\nanimals, as I have said. It is not as though we must all of necessity eat\r\nall kinds—for perhaps that would not be convenient—but we are to use first\r\nwhat our physical powers allow; secondly, what is at hand in abundance;\r\nthirdly, we are to exercise our own wills. But at the season of the sacred\r\nceremonies we ought to exert those wills to the utmost so that we may\r\nattain to what is beyond our ordinary physical powers, and thus may be\r\neager and willing to obey the divine ordinances. For it is by all means\r\nmore effective for the salvation of the soul itself that one should pay\r\ngreater heed to its safety than to the safety of the body. And moreover\r\nthe body too seems thereby to share insensibly in that great and\r\nmarvellous benefit. For when the soul abandons herself wholly to the gods,\r\nand entrusts her own concerns absolutely to the higher powers, and then\r\nfollow the sacred rites—these too being preceded by the divine\r\nordinances—then, I say, since there is nothing to hinder or prevent—for\r\nall things reside in the gods, all things subsist in relation to them, all\r\nthings are filled with the gods—straightway the divine light illumines our\r\nsouls. And thus endowed with divinity they impart a certain vigour and\r\nenergy to the breath(888) implanted in them by nature; and so that breath\r\nis hardened as it were and strengthened by the soul, and hence gives\r\nhealth to the whole body. For I think not one of the sons of Asclepios\r\nwould deny that all diseases, or at any rate very many and those the most\r\nserious, are caused by the disturbance and derangement of the breathing.\r\nSome doctors assert that all diseases, others that the greater number and\r\nthe most serious and hardest to cure, are due to this. Moreover the\r\noracles of the gods bear witness thereto, I mean that by the rite of\r\npurification not the soul alone but the body as well is greatly benefited\r\nand preserved. Indeed the gods when they exhort those theurgists who are\r\nespecially holy, announce to them that their “mortal husk of raw\r\nmatter”(889) shall be preserved from perishing.)\r\n\r\nΤίς οὖν ἡμῖν ὑπολείπεται λόγος, ἄλλως τε καὶ ἐν βραχεῖ νυκτὸς μέρει ταῦτα\r\nἀπνευστὶ ξυνεῖραι(890) συγχωρηθεῖσιν, οὐδὲν οὔτε προανεγνωκόσιν οὔτε\r\nσκεψαμένοις περὶ αὐτῶν, [179] ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ προελομένοις ὑπὲρ τούτων εἰπεῖν\r\nπρὶν ἢ τὰς δέλτους ταύτας αἰτῆσαι; μάρτυς δὲ ἡ θεός μοι τοῦ λόγου. ἀλλ᾽,\r\nὅπερ ἔφην, τί τὸ λειπόμενον ἡμῖν ὑμνῆσαι τὴν θεὸν μετὰ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς καὶ τοῦ\r\nΔιονύσου, ὧν δὴ καὶ τὰς ἑορτὰς ἐν ταύταις ἔθετο ταῖς ἁγιστείαις ὁ νόμος;\r\nὁρῶ μὲν τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς πρὸς τὴν Μητέρα τῶν θεῶν διὰ τῆς προνοητικῆς ἐν\r\nἑκατέραις ταῖς οὐσίαις ὁμοιότητος [B] τὴν συγγένειαν ἐπισκοπῶ δὲ καὶ τὴν\r\nΔιονύσου μεριστὴν δημιουργίαν, ἣν ἐκ τῆς ἑνοειδοῦς καὶ μονίμου ζωῆς τοῦ\r\nμεγάλου Διὸς ὁ μέγας Διόνυσος παραδεξάμενος, ἅτε καὶ προελθὼν ἐξ ἐκείνου,\r\nτοῖς φαινομένοις ἅπασιν ἐγκατένειμεν, ἐπιτροπεύων καὶ βασιλεύων τῆς\r\nμεριστῆς συμπάσης δημιουργίας. προσήκει δὲ σὺν τούτοις ὑμνῆσαι καὶ τὸν\r\nἘπαφρόδιτον Ἑρμῆν· [C] καλεῖται γὰρ οὕτως ὑπὸ τῶν μυστῶν ὁ θεὸς οὗτος,\r\nὅσοι λαμπάδας φασὶν ἀνάπτειν Ἄττιδι τῷ σοφῷ. τίς οὖν οὕτω παχὺς τὴν ψυχήν,\r\nὃς οὐ συνίησιν, ὅτι δι᾽ Ἑρμοῦ μὲν καὶ Ἀφροδίτης ἀνακαλεῖται πάντα πανταχοῦ\r\nτὰ τῆς γενέσεως ἔχοντα τὸ ἕνεκά του(891) πάντη καὶ πάντως ὃ τοῦ λόγου\r\nμάλιστα ἴδιόν ἐστιν; Ἄττις δὲ οὐχ οὗτος ἐστιν ὁ μικρῷ πρόσθεν ἄφρων, νῦν\r\nδὲ ἀκούων διὰ τὴν ἐκτομὴν σοφός; ἄφρων μὲν ὅτι τὴν ὕλην εἵλετο καὶ τὴν\r\nγένεσιν ἐπιτροπεύει, σοφὸς δὲ ὅτι τὸ σκύβαλον τοῦτο εἰς κάλλος ἐκόσμησε\r\nτοσοῦτον [D] καὶ μετέστησεν, ὅσον οὐδεμί ἂν μιμήσαιτο ἀνθρώπων τέχνη καὶ\r\nσένεσις. ἀλλὰ τί πέρας ἔσται μοι τῶν λόγων; ἢ δῆλον ὡς ὁ τῆς μεγάλης ὕμνος\r\nθεοῦ;\r\n\r\n(And now what is left for me to say? Especially since it was granted me to\r\ncompose this hymn at a breath, in the short space of one night, without\r\nhaving read anything on the subject beforehand, or thought it over. Nay, I\r\nhad not even planned to speak thereof until the moment that I asked for\r\nthese writing‐tablets. May the goddess bear witness to the truth of my\r\nwords! Nevertheless, as I said before, does there not still remain for me\r\nto celebrate the goddess in her union with Athene and Dionysus? For the\r\nsacred law established their festivals at the very time of her sacred\r\nrites. And I recognise the kinship of Athene and the Mother of the Gods\r\nthrough the similarity of the forethought that inheres in the substance of\r\nboth goddesses. And I discern also the divided creative function of\r\nDionysus, which great Dionysus received from the single and abiding\r\nprinciple of life that is in mighty Zeus. For from Zeus he proceeded, and\r\nhe bestows that life on all things visible, controlling and governing the\r\ncreation of the whole divisible world. Together with these gods we ought\r\nto celebrate Hermes Epaphroditus.(892) For so this god is entitled by the\r\ninitiated who say that he kindles the torches for wise Attis. And who has\r\na soul so dense as not to understand that through Hermes and Aphrodite are\r\ninvoked all generated things everywhere, since they everywhere and\r\nthroughout have a purpose which is peculiarly appropriate to the\r\nLogos?(893) But is not this Logos Attis, who not long ago was out of his\r\nsenses, but now through his castration is called wise? Yes, he was out of\r\nhis senses because he preferred matter and presides over generation, but\r\nhe is wise because he adorned and transformed this refuse, our earth, with\r\nsuch beauty as no human art or cunning could imitate. But how shall I\r\nconclude my discourse? Surely with this hymn to the Great Goddess.)\r\n\r\nὮ θεῶν καὶ ἀνθρώπων μῆτερ, ὦ τοῦ μεγάλου σύνθωκε καὶ σύνθρονε Διός, ὦ πηγὴ\r\nτῶν νοερῶν θεῶν, ὦ τῶν νοητῶν ταῖς ἀχράντοις οὐσίαις συνδραμοῦσα καὶ τὴν\r\nκοινὴν ἐκ πάντων αἰτίαν παραδεξαμένη [180] καὶ τοῖς νοεροῖς ἐνδιδοῦσα\r\nζωογόνε θεὰ καὶ μῆτις καὶ πρόνοια καὶ τῶν ἡμετέρων ψυχῶν δημιουργέ, ὦ τὸν\r\nμέγαν Διόνυσον ἀγαπῶσα καὶ τὸν Ἄττιν ἐκτεθέντα περισωσαμένη καὶ πάλιν\r\nαὐτὸν εἰς τὸ γῆς ἄντρον καταδυόμενον ἐπανάγουσα, ὦ πάντων μὲν ἀγαθῶν τοῖς\r\nνοεροῖς ἡγουμένη θεοῖς, πάντων δὲ ἀποπληροῦσα τὸν αἰσθητὸν κόσμον, πάντα\r\nδὲ ἡμῖν ἐν πᾶσιν ἀγαθὰ χαρισαμένη, δίδου πᾶσι [B] μὲν ἀνθρώποις\r\nεὐδαιμονίαν, ἧς τὸ κεφάλαιον ἡ τῶν θεῶν γνῶσίς ἐστι, κοινῇ δὲ τῷ Ῥωμαίων\r\nδήμῳ, μάλιστα μὲν ἀποτρίψασθαι τῆς ἀθεότητος τὴν κηλίδα, πρὸς δὲ καὶ τὴν\r\nτύχην εὐμενῆ συνδιακυβερνῶσαν αὐτῷ τὰ τῆς ἀρχῆς πολλὰς χιλιάδας ἐτῶν, ἐμοὶ\r\nδὲ καρπὸν γενέσθαι τῆς περὶ σὲ θεραπείας ἀλήθειαν ἐν τοῖς περὶ θεῶν\r\nδόγμασιν, ἐν θεουργίᾳ τελειότητα, πάντων ἔργων, οἷς προσερχόμεθα περὶ τὰς\r\nπολιτικὰς [C] καὶ στρατιωτικὰς πράξεις,(894) ἀρετὴν μετὰ τῆς ἀγαθῆς τύχης\r\nκαὶ τὸ τοῦ βίου πέρας ἄλυπον τε καὶ εὐδόκιμον μετὰ τῆς ἀγαθῆς ἐλπίδος τῆς\r\nἐπὶ τῇ παρ᾽ ὑμᾶς πορείᾳ.\r\n\r\n(O Mother of gods and men, thou that art the assessor of Zeus and sharest\r\nhis throne, O source of the intellectual gods, that pursuest thy course\r\nwith the stainless substance of the intelligible gods; that dost receive\r\nfrom them all the common cause of things and dost thyself bestow it on the\r\nintellectual gods; O life‐giving goddess that art the counsel and the\r\nprovidence and the creator of our souls; O thou that lovest great\r\nDionysus, and didst save Attis when exposed at birth, and didst lead him\r\nback when he had descended into the cave of the nymph; O thou that givest\r\nall good things to the intellectual gods and fillest with all things this\r\nsensible world, and with all the rest givest us all things good! Do thou\r\ngrant to all men happiness, and that highest happiness of all, the\r\nknowledge of the gods; and grant to the Roman people in general that they\r\nmay cleanse themselves of the stain of impiety; grant them a blessed lot,\r\nand help them to guide their Empire for many thousands of years! And for\r\nmyself, grant me as fruit of my worship of thee that I may have true\r\nknowledge in the doctrines about the gods. Make me perfect in theurgy. And\r\nin all that I undertake, in the affairs of the state and the army, grant\r\nme virtue and good fortune, and that the close of my life may be painless\r\nand glorious, in the good hope that it is to you, the gods, that I\r\njourney!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n_References to Homer are not given on account of their number._\r\n\r\nAchilles, 133, 143, 147, 155, 161, 181, 199,

The first of these\r\n      worlds the Neo‐Platonists took over from Plato, _Republic_ 508\r\n      foll.; the second was invented by Iamblichus.\r\n\r\n  630 ἀγέννητος Hertlein suggests, ἀγεννήτως MSS.\r\n\r\n  631 Pindar _fr._ 107, and Sophocles, _Antigone_ 100 ἀκτὶς ἀελίου.\r\n\r\n  632 Republic 508 B.\r\n\r\n  633 ἁλήθεια Hertlein suggests, ἀλήθεια MSS.\r\n\r\n  634 Though Aristotle did not use this phrase, it was his theory of a\r\n      fifth element superior to the other four, called by him “aether” or\r\n      “first element,” _De Coelo_ 1. 3 270 B, that suggested to Iamblichus\r\n      the notion of a fifth substance or element; cf. _Theologumena\r\n      Arithmeticae_ 35, 22 Ast, where he calls the fifth element “aether.”\r\n\r\n  635 After τοσούτων Hertlein suggests αἴτοις.\r\n\r\n  636 cf. 138 B.\r\n\r\n  637 Aristotle, _De Anima_ 418 A.\r\n\r\n  638 γε Hertlein suggests, τε MSS.\r\n\r\n  639 133 B.\r\n\r\n  640 Julian conceives of the sun in three ways; first as transcendental,\r\n      in which form he is indistinguishable from the Good in the\r\n      intelligible world, secondly as Helios‐Mithras, ruler of the\r\n      intellectual gods, thirdly as the visible sun.\r\n\r\n  641 133 D‐134 A is a digression on the light of the sun.\r\n\r\n  642 _i.e._ the stars.\r\n\r\n  643 _De Anima_ 419 A; Aristotle there says that light is the\r\n      actualisation or positive determination of the transparent medium.\r\n      Julian echoes the whole passage.\r\n\r\n  644 Mind, νοῦς, is here identified with Helios; cf. Macrobius,\r\n      _Saturnalia_ 1. 19. 9. Sol mundi mens est, “the sun is the mind of\r\n      the universe”; Iamblichus, _Protrepticus_ 21, 115; Ammianus\r\n      Marcellinus, 21. 1. 11.\r\n\r\n  645 Julian echoes Plato, _Republic_ 507, 508.\r\n\r\n  646 cf. 146 D.\r\n\r\n  647 _i.e._ the stationary positions and the direct and retrograde\r\n      movements of the planets.\r\n\r\n  648 157 C.\r\n\r\n  649 αὐτοῦ Hertlein suggests, ἑαυτοῦ MSS.\r\n\r\n  650 144 A, B, 149 C.\r\n\r\n  651 _Cratylus_ 403 B.\r\n\r\n  652 _Phaedo_ 83 D.\r\n\r\n  653 ἔκγονον MSS, ἔγγονον V, Hertlein.\r\n\r\n  654 δὲ τίς ἂν ἄλλος Hertlein suggests, δέ τις ἂν εἴη MSS.\r\n\r\n  655 _Iliad_ 8. 480; _Odyssey_ 1. 8.\r\n\r\n  656 _Odyssey_ 12. 383.\r\n\r\n  657 This oracular verse is quoted as Orphic by Macrobius, _Saturnalia_\r\n      1. 18. 18; but Julian, no doubt following Iamblichus, substitutes\r\n      Serapis for Dionysus at the end of the verse. The worship of Serapis\r\n      in the Graeco‐Roman world began with the foundation of a Serapeum by\r\n      Ptolemy Soter at Alexandria. Serapis was identified with Osiris, the\r\n      Egyptian counterpart of Dionysus.\r\n\r\n  658 _Phaedo_ 80 D; in _Cratylus_ 403 Plato discusses, though not\r\n      seriously, the etymology of the word “Hades.”\r\n\r\n  659 Ἁΐδης, “Unseen.”\r\n\r\n  660 _Theogony_ 371; cf. Pindar, _Isthmian_ 4. 1.\r\n\r\n  661 Hyperion means “he that walks above.”\r\n\r\n  662 They had devoured the oxen of the sun; _Odyssey_ 12. 352 foll.\r\n\r\n  663 _Iliad_ 8. 24; Zeus utters this threat against the gods if they\r\n      should aid either the Trojans or the Greeks.\r\n\r\n  664 _Iliad_ 18. 239.\r\n\r\n  665 _Iliad_ 21. 6.\r\n\r\n  666 Julian now describes the substance or essential nature, οὐσία, of\r\n      Helios, 137 D‐142 B.\r\n\r\n  667 _i.e._ The sun, moon and planets; the orbits of the planets are\r\n      complicated by their direct and retrograde movements.\r\n\r\n  668 cf. 133 D.\r\n\r\n  669 τὰ τελευταῖα Hertlein suggests, τελευταῖα MSS.\r\n\r\n  670 Julian defines the ways in which Helios possesses μεσότης, or\r\n      middleness; he is mediator and connecting link as well as locally\r\n      midway between the two worlds and the centre of the intellectual\r\n      gods; see Introduction, p. 350.\r\n\r\n  671 cf. Empedocles, _fr._ 18; 122, 2; 17, 19 Diels.\r\n\r\n  672 τὰ Hertlein suggests, ταῦτα MSS.\r\n\r\n  673 Plato, _Timaeus_ 33 A.\r\n\r\n  674 cf. 139 C; _Oration_ 5. 165 C, 166 D, 170 C.\r\n\r\n  675 τὰς Hertlein suggests.\r\n\r\n  676 cf. 167 D. In _Timaeus_ 58 A it is the revolution of the whole which\r\n      by constriction compresses all matter together, but Julian had that\r\n      passage in mind. In Empedocles it is the Titan, Aether, _i.e._ the\r\n      Fifth Substance, that “binds the globe.” _fr._ 38 Diels.\r\n\r\n  677 Plato in _Timaeus_ 41 A, distinguishes “the gods who revolve before\r\n      our eyes” from “those who reveal themselves so far as they will.”\r\n      Julian regularly describes, as here, a triad; every one of his three\r\n      worlds has its own unconditioned being (αὐθυπόστατον); its own\r\n      creative power (δημιουργία); its own power to generate life (γόνιμον\r\n      τῆς ζωῆς); and in every case, the middle term is Helios as a\r\n      connecting link in his capacity of thinking or intellectual god\r\n      (νοερός).\r\n\r\n  678 Julian now describes the three kinds of substance (οὐσία) and its\r\n      three forms (εἴδη) in the three worlds.\r\n\r\n  679 _i.e._ the visible heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\n  680 Helios connects the forms (Plato’s Ideas) which exist in the\r\n      intelligible world, with those which in our world ally themselves\r\n      with matter; cf. _Oration_ 5. 171 B.\r\n\r\n  681 αὐτὰ V, αὐτὸς MSS, Hertlein.\r\n\r\n  682 _i.e._ the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\n  683 These angels combine, as does a model, the idea and its\r\n      hypostazisation; cf. 142 A, _Letter to the Athenians_ 275 B. Julian\r\n      nowhere defines angels, but Porphyry as quoted by Augustine, _De\r\n      civitate Dei_ 10, 9, distinguished them from daemons and placed them\r\n      in the aether.\r\n\r\n  684 προηγούμενος V, προκαθηγούμενος MSS, Hertlein.\r\n\r\n  685 cf. 141 B.\r\n\r\n  686 _i.e._ the heavenly bodies; cf. _Fragment of a Letter_ 295 A.\r\n\r\n  687 _Nichomachean Ethics_ 7. 14. 1154 b.\r\n\r\n  688 τοιοῦτον Hertlein suggests, τούτων MSS.\r\n\r\n  689 The powers and activities of Helios are now described, 142 D‐152 A.\r\n\r\n  690 cf. 148 C, _Timaeus_ 47 A, _Republic_ 529 B, where Plato\r\n      distinguishes mere star‐gazing from astronomy.\r\n\r\n  691 διὰ τὴν Hertlein suggests, καὶ τὴν MSS.\r\n\r\n  692 cf. 144 C.\r\n\r\n  693 _Timaeus_ 32 B; Plato says that to make the universe solid, “God set\r\n      air and water between fire and earth.”\r\n\r\n  694 cf. 144 C. 179 A; Proclus on Plato, _Timaeus_ 203 E, says that\r\n      because Dionysus was torn asunder by the Titans, his function is to\r\n      divide wholes into their parts and to separate the forms (εἴδη).\r\n\r\n  695 Julian calls Dionysus the son of Helios 152 C, D, and the son of\r\n      Zeus, _Oration_ 5. 179 B.\r\n\r\n  696 cf. 153 B, where Asclepios is called “the saviour of the All,” and\r\n      _Against the Christians_ 200 A.\r\n\r\n  697 ἔκγονος MSS, ἔγγονος V, Hertlein.\r\n\r\n  698 νοητοῖς Petavius adds.\r\n\r\n  699 cf. 141 B, _Letter to the Athenians_ 275 B.\r\n\r\n  700 The sun.\r\n\r\n  701 Plato, _Symposium_ 206 B τόκος ἐν καλῷ.\r\n\r\n  702 _i.e._ Intellectual Helios.\r\n\r\n  703 _i.e._ Intelligible Helios.\r\n\r\n  704 Plato, _Laws_ 713 D defines daemons as a race superior to men but\r\n      inferior to gods; they were created to watch over human affairs;\r\n      Julian, _Letter to Themistius_ 258 B echoes Plato’s description; cf.\r\n      Plotinus 3. 5. 6; pseudo‐Iamblichus, _De Mysteriis_ 1. 20. 61;\r\n      Julian 2. 90 B.\r\n\r\n  705 _i.e._ the individual souls; by using this term, derived from the\r\n      Neo‐Platonists and Iamblichus, Julian implies that there is an\r\n      indivisible world soul; cf. Plotinus 4. 8. 8 ἡ μὲν ὅλη (ψυχὴ) ... αἱ\r\n      δὲ ἑν μέρει γενόμεναι.\r\n\r\n  706 _Odyssey_ 11, 303; Philo Judaeus, _De Decalogo_ 2. 190, τόν τε\r\n      οὐρανὸν εἰς ἡμισφαίρια τῷ λόγῳ διχῇ διανείμαντες, τὸ μὲν ὑπὲρ γῆς τὸ\r\n      δ᾽ ὑπὸ γῆς, Διοσκούρους ἐκάλεσαν τὸ περὶ τῆς ἑτερημέρου ζωῆς αὐτῶν\r\n      προστερατευσάμενοι διήγημα.\r\n\r\n  707 κενὸν Hertlein suggests, καινὸν Mb, κοινὸν MSS.\r\n\r\n  708 _Timaeus_ 37 C; when the Creator had made the universe, he invented\r\n      Time as an attribute of “divided substance.”\r\n\r\n  709 For Julian’s debt to Iamblichus cf. 150 D, 157 B, C.\r\n\r\n  710 Kronos, Zeus, Ares, Helios, Aphrodite, Hermes, Selene are the seven\r\n      planets; cf. 149 D. Though Helios guides the others he is counted\r\n      with them.\r\n\r\n  711 _i.e._ the fixed stars; cf. Iamblichus, _Theologumena arithmeticae_\r\n      56. 4 ἡ περιέχουσα τὰ πάντα σφαῖρα ὀγδόη, “the eighth sphere that\r\n      encompasses all the rest.”\r\n\r\n  712 The Graces are often associated with Spring; Julian seems to be\r\n      describing obscurely the annual course of the sun.\r\n\r\n  713 Necessity played an important part in the cult of Mithras and was\r\n      sometimes identified with the constellation Virgo who holds the\r\n      scales of Justice.\r\n\r\n  714 For the adoption of the Dioscuri into the Mithraic cult see Cumont.\r\n      Julian does not give his own view, though he rejects that of the\r\n      later Greek astronomers. Macrobius, _Saturnalia_ 1. 21. 22\r\n      identifies them with the sun.\r\n\r\n  715 _i.e._ the torrid zone. On the equator in the winter months shadows\r\n      fall due north at noon, in the summer months due south; this is more\r\n      or less true of the whole torrid zone; cf. ἀμφίσκιος which has the\r\n      same meaning.\r\n\r\n  716 _Iliad_ 14. 246.\r\n\r\n  717 For the affectation of mystery cf. 152 B, 159 A, 172 D.\r\n\r\n  718 δὴ Hertlein suggests, δὲ MSS.\r\n\r\n  719 Plutarch, _Demosthenes_ 4, quotes this phrase as peculiarly\r\n      Platonic; cf.

Zeller, _Philosophie der Griechen_ III. 2, p. 753, notes.\r\n\r\n  726 There is a play on the word κύκλος, which means both “sphere” and\r\n      “circle.”\r\n\r\n  727 The Egyptian sun‐god, whose worship was introduced first into Greece\r\n      and later at Rome.\r\n\r\n  728 Athene as goddess of Forethought was worshipped at Delphi, but her\r\n      earlier epithet was προναία “whose statue is in front of the\r\n      temple”; cf. Aeschylus, _Eumenides_ 21, Herodotus 8. 37; late\r\n      writers often confuse these forms. Julian applies the epithet\r\n      πρόνοια to the mother of the gods 179 A, and to Prometheus 182 D;\r\n      cf. 131 C.\r\n\r\n  729 This verse was quoted from an unknown source by Eustathius on\r\n      _Iliad_ 1. p. 83. “The Grey‐eyed” is a name of Athene.\r\n\r\n  730 _Iliad_ 8. 538; 13. 827.\r\n\r\n  731 δ᾽ Hertlein adds.\r\n\r\n  732 τὸ Hertlein adds.\r\n\r\n  733 ἐπιμετρῆσαι Hertlein suggests, μετριάσαι MSS.\r\n\r\n  734 Ἔμεσαν Spanheim, cf. 154 B, Ἔδεσσαν MSS.\r\n\r\n  735 On Athene cf. _Oration_ 7. 230 A; _Against the Christians_ 235 C.\r\n\r\n  736 cf. 152 D. Julian derives his theory of the position and functions\r\n      of the moon from Iamblichus; cf. Proclus on Plato, _Timaeus_ 258 f.\r\n\r\n  737 cf. 154 A, and Proclus on Plato, _Timaeus_ 155 F, 259 B, where\r\n      Aphrodite is called “the binding goddess” συνδετικήν, and\r\n      “harmoniser” συναρμοστικήν.\r\n\r\n  738 _i.e._ as the planet Venus.\r\n\r\n  739 cf. _Caesars_ 313 A, _Misopogon_ 357 C. Emesa in Syria was famous\r\n      for its temple to Baal, the sun‐god. The Emperor Heliogabalus\r\n      (218‐222 A.D.) was born at Emesa and was, as his name indicates, a\r\n      priest of Baal, whose worship he attempted to introduce at Rome.\r\n\r\n  740 The “strong god,” identified with the star Lucifer.\r\n\r\n  741 133 D, 138 B.\r\n\r\n  742 τὸ γόνιμον τῇ φύσει Marcilius, cf. 150 B, 151 C, lacuna MSS.,\r\n      Hertlein.\r\n\r\n  743 _Physics_ 2. 2. 194 b; cf. 131 C.\r\n\r\n  744 cf. 145 C.\r\n\r\n  745 cf. 145 C.\r\n\r\n  746 _i.e._ their ascent after death to the gods.\r\n\r\n  747 περὶ Hertlein suggests, ἐπὶ MSS.\r\n\r\n  748 _Republic_ 529, 530; _Epinomis_ 977 A.\r\n\r\n  749 _Laws_ 653 C, D, 665 A.\r\n\r\n  750 _i.e._ as a unit of measurement; _Timaeus_ 39 B, 47 A.\r\n\r\n  751 γέννησιν Mau, γένεσιν MSS, Hertlein.\r\n\r\n  752 cf. 144 C: _Against the Christians_ 200, 235 B.C. Asclepios plays an\r\n      important part in Julian’s religion, and may have been intentionally\r\n      opposed, as the son of Helios‐Mithras and the “saviour of the\r\n      world,” to Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n  753 τὸ Hertlein suggests.\r\n\r\n  754 Ἔμεσαν Spanheim, Ἔδεσσαν MSS, Hertlein; cf. 150 C.\r\n\r\n  755 Rome.\r\n\r\n  756 This refers to the famous temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline; cf.\r\n      _Oration_ 1. 29 D. The three shrines in this temple were dedicated\r\n      to Jupiter, Minerva and Juno, but Julian ignores Juno because he\r\n      wishes to introduce Aphrodite in connection with Aeneas.\r\n\r\n  757 Julian accepts the impossible etymology “path of the wolf”; Lycabas\r\n      means “path of light,” cf. _lux_.\r\n\r\n  758 _Odyssey_, 14. 161.

Myths are like toys which help children through teething.\r\n\r\n  788 ἐξοίσομεν Cobet adds, ἀνέξοιστα καὶ MSS, Hertlein.\r\n\r\n  789 οὑτοσὶ Hertlein suggests, οὑτωσὶ MSS.\r\n\r\n  790 μικρὰν Hertlein, μικρὸν Naber, who thinks ἱστορίαν a gloss, cf.\r\n      _Oration_ vii. 276 C, μικρὸν ἱστορίαν MSS, μικρὸν ἱστορίας Reiske.\r\n\r\n  791 ὡς Petavius adds.\r\n\r\n  792 αὐτὴν Hertlein suggests, αὑτὴν MSS.\r\n\r\n  793 ἐπήγοντο Hertlein suggests, ἐπῆγον τὸν MSS.\r\n\r\n  794 The Phrygian god of vegetation who corresponds to the Syrian Adonis.\r\n      His name is said to mean “father,” and he is at once the lover and\r\n      son of the Mother of the Gods. His death and resurrection were\r\n      celebrated in spring.\r\n\r\n  795 The generic name for the eunuch priests of Attis.\r\n\r\n  796 The Phrygian Cybele, the Asiatic goddess of fertility; the chief\r\n      seat of her worship was Pessinus in Phrygia.\r\n\r\n  797 _i.e._ after the middle of the fifth century B.C.; before that date\r\n      the records were kept in the Acropolis.\r\n\r\n  798 In 204 B.C.; cf. Livy 29. 10 foll.; Silius Italicus 17. 1 foll.;\r\n      Ovid, _Fasti_ 4. 255 foll. tells the legend and describes the ritual\r\n      of the cult.\r\n\r\n  799 The Attalids.\r\n\r\n  800 A black meteoric stone embodied the goddess of Pessinus.\r\n\r\n  801 Claudia, turritae rara ministra deae. “Claudia thou peerless\r\n      priestess of the goddess with the embattled crown.”—Propertius 4.\r\n      11. 52.\r\n\r\n  802 A matron in other versions.\r\n\r\n  803 In the Third Punic War, which began 149 B.C., Carthage was sacked by\r\n      the Romans under Scipio.\r\n\r\n  804 Plato, _Republic_ 519 A δριμὺ μὲν βλέπει τὸ ψυχάριον.\r\n\r\n  805 A relief in the Capitoline Museum shows Claudia in the act of\r\n      dragging the ship.\r\n\r\n  806 _i.e._ the world of sense‐perception.\r\n\r\n  807 Plotinus 1. 8. 4 called matter “the privation of the Good,” στέρησις\r\n      ἀγαθοῦ.\r\n\r\n  808 Helios; cf. _Oration_ 4. 140 A. Attis is here identified with the\r\n      light of the sun.\r\n\r\n  809 Julian here sums up the tendency of the philosophy of his age. The\r\n      Peripatetics had been merged in the Platonists and Neo‐Platonists,\r\n      and Themistius the Aristotelian commentator often speaks of the\r\n      reconciliation, in contemporary philosophy, of Plato and Aristotle;\r\n      cf. 235 C, 236, 366 C. Julian, following the example of Iamblichus,\r\n      would force them into agreement; but the final appeal was to\r\n      revealed religion.\r\n\r\n  810 προϋφεστῶτες Hertlein suggests, cf. 165 D, προεστῶτες MSS.\r\n\r\n  811 233 D.\r\n\r\n  812 αὐτόν Hertlein suggests, αὐτό MSS.\r\n\r\n  813 _Sophist_ 235 A; cf. _Republic_ 596 D.\r\n\r\n  814 _i.e._ aether, the fifth substance.\r\n\r\n  815 _i.e._ the causes of the forms that are embodied in matter have a\r\n      prior existence as Ideas.\r\n\r\n  816 An echo of Plato, _Theaetetus_ 191 C, 196 A; _Timaeus_ 50 C.\r\n\r\n  817 _De Anima_ 3. 4. 429 A; Aristotle quotes the phrase with approval\r\n      and evidently attributes it to Plato; the precise expression is not\r\n      to be found in Plato, though in _Parmenides_ 132 B he says that the\r\n      Ideas are “in our souls.”\r\n\r\n  818 περιθεῖναι Hertlein suggests, cf. Sallust, _On the Gods and the\r\n      World_ 249, τὸν ἀστερωτὸν αὐτῷ περιθεῖναι πῖλον: ἐπιθεῖναι MSS.\r\n\r\n  819 αἰνίττεσθαι Hertlein suggests, cf. Sallust 250 τὸν γαλαξόαν\r\n      αἰνίττεται κύκλον: μαντεύεσθαι MSS.\r\n\r\n  820 cf. Porphyry, _On the Cave of the Nymph_ 7; and Plato, _Republic_\r\n      514 A.\r\n\r\n  821 προüφέστηκε Hertlein suggests, προέστηκε MSS.\r\n\r\n  822 _fr._ 36, Diels.\r\n\r\n  823 For the superiority of the soul to nature cf. _De Mysteriis_ 8. 7.\r\n      270; and for the theory that the soul gives form to matter, Plotinus\r\n      4. 3. 20.\r\n\r\n  824 _i.e._ the fifth substance.\r\n\r\n  825 Helios; cf. 161 D. The whole passage implies the identification of\r\n      Attis with nature, and of the world‐soul with Helios; cf. 162 A\r\n      where Attis is called “Nature,” φύσις.\r\n\r\n  826 cf. 170 D, 168 C; Sallust, _On the Gods and the World_ 4. 16. 1.\r\n\r\n  827 cf. 171 A; Sallust also identifies Gallus with the Milky Way, 4. 14.\r\n      25.\r\n\r\n  828 ἑαυτὸ Shorey suggests, τοῦτο Hertlein, MSS.\r\n\r\n  829 λέγομεν Petavius suggests, lacuna Hertlein, MSS.\r\n\r\n  830 τε Hertlein suggests.\r\n\r\n  831 τὰς Hertlein suggests.\r\n\r\n  832 μὲν Hertlein suggests, γε MSS.\r\n\r\n  833 κρείττων Hertlein suggests, κρεῖττον MSS.\r\n\r\n  834 ἢ ὅτε Shorey, ὅτε Hertlein, MSS.\r\n\r\n  835 προüφεστῶσαν Hertlein suggests, προεστῶσαν MSS.\r\n\r\n  836 τῇ δὲ Hertlein suggests, τῇ MSS.\r\n\r\n  837 φησιν ὁ μῦθος Hertlein suggests, φησι MSS.\r\n\r\n  838 A finite verb _e.g._ φαίνεται is needed to complete the\r\n      construction.\r\n\r\n  839 καὶ Friederich, πέπεικε Hertlein, MSS.\r\n\r\n  840 cf. 170 D, 179 D.\r\n\r\n  841 _i.e._ Zeus.\r\n\r\n  842 Hence she is the counterpart of Athene, cf. 179 A. Athene is\r\n      Forethought among the intellectual gods; Cybele is Forethought among\r\n      the intelligible gods and therefore superior to Athene; cf. 180 A.\r\n\r\n  843 The Corybantes were the Phrygian priests of Cybele, who at Rome were\r\n      called Galli.\r\n\r\n  844 The Asiatic deities, especially Cybele, are often represented\r\n      holding lions, or in cars drawn by them. cf. Catullus 63. 76,\r\n      _juncta juga resolvens Cybele leonibus_, “Cybele unharnessed her\r\n      team of lions”; she sends a lion in pursuit of Attis, cf. 168 B;\r\n      Porphyry, _On the Cave of the Nymph_ 3. 2. 287 calls the sign of the\r\n      lion “the dwelling of Helios.”\r\n\r\n  845 _Iliad_ 10. 23 λέοντος αἴθωνος.\r\n\r\n  846 cf. _Oration_ 4. 145 C.\r\n\r\n  847 A finite verb is needed to complete the construction. For the\r\n      anacoluthon cf. 167 D.\r\n\r\n  848 καὶ διὰ Hertlein suggests, καὶ MSS.\r\n\r\n  849 A pine sacred to Attis was felled on March 22nd; cf. Frazer, _Attis,\r\n      Adonis and Osiris_, p. 222.\r\n\r\n  850 cf. 171 C, 175 A.\r\n\r\n  851 March 23rd.\r\n\r\n  852 March 24th was the date of the castration of the Galli, the priests\r\n      of Attis.\r\n\r\n  853 On March 25th the resurrection of Attis and the freeing of our souls\r\n      from generation (γένεσις) was celebrated by the feast of the\r\n      Hilaria.\r\n\r\n  854 ἡγεμόνας Shorey, cf. 170 A, B, ἡμῶν Hertlein, MSS.\r\n\r\n  855 αὐτὰς Hertlein suggests, αὐτὰ MSS.\r\n\r\n  856 169 D‐170 C is a digression on the value of myths, which the wise\r\n      man is not to accept without an allegorising interpretation; cf.\r\n      _Oration_ 7. 216 C.\r\n\r\n  857 τελευταίας αἰτίας Hertlein suggests, τελευταίας MSS.\r\n\r\n  858 In 167 D Attis was identified with the light of the moon; cf.\r\n      _Oration_ 4. 150 A; where the moon is called the lowest of the\r\n      spheres, who gives form to the world of matter that lies below her;\r\n      cf. Sallust, _On the Gods and the World_ 4. 14. 23; where Attis is\r\n      called the creator of our world.\r\n\r\n  859 προκαλεῖται Hertlein suggests, προσκαλεῖται MSS.\r\n\r\n  860 δὴ καὶ Hertlein suggests, δὲ καὶ V, καὶ MSS.\r\n\r\n  861 _Phaedrus_ 250 D, _Timaeus_ 47 A, _Republic_ 507‐508.\r\n\r\n  862 Porphyry, _On the Cave of the Nymph_ 22, says that Cancer and\r\n      Capricorn are the two gates of the sun; and that souls descend\r\n      through Cancer and rise aloft through Capricorn.\r\n\r\n  863 This seems to identify Attis with the sun’s rays.\r\n\r\n  864 Chaldean astrology and the Chaldean oracles are often cited with\r\n      respect by the Neo‐Platonists; for allusions to their worship of the\r\n      Seven‐rayed Mithras (Helios) cf. Damascius 294 and Proclus on\r\n      _Timaeus_ 1. 11.\r\n\r\n  865 _e.g._ Iamblichus and especially Maximus of Ephesus who is a typical\r\n      theurgist of the fourth century A.D. and was supposed to work\r\n      miracles.\r\n\r\n  866 δὴ Shorey, δὲ Hertlein, MSS.\r\n\r\n  867 αὐτὴ Wright, αὕτη MSS., Hertlein.\r\n\r\n  868 ἱερέων Hertlein suggests, ἱερῶν MSS.\r\n\r\n  869 The Eleusinian Mysteries of Demeter and Persephone; the Lesser were\r\n      celebrated in February, the greater in September.\r\n\r\n  870 Plato, _Gorgias_ 497 C; Plutarch, _Demetrius_ 900 B.\r\n\r\n  871 αὐτὸς εἰρηκώς Hertlein suggests, εἰρηκὼς MSS.\r\n\r\n  872 προüφεστώσῃ Hertlein suggests, προεστεώσῃ MSS.\r\n\r\n  873 δὲ Hertlein suggests, γε MSS.\r\n\r\n  874 cf. _Oration_ 4. 131 A.\r\n\r\n  875 Attis.\r\n\r\n  876 ᾗ Hertlein suggests, οὗ MSS.\r\n\r\n  877 cf. 168 D‐169 A, 171 C.\r\n\r\n  878 παρακελεύονται Wyttenbach, μολλαχοῦ παρακελεύονται Hertlein, MSS.\r\n\r\n  879 The construction of καὶ καλάμης is not clear; Petavius suspects\r\n      corruption or omission.\r\n\r\n  880 ποιητικώτερον Naber, τι καὶ ποιητικὸν Hertlein, MSS.\r\n\r\n  881 ὁρμῶντα Naber.\r\n\r\n  882 _Theaetetus_ 176 A; cf. _Oration_ 2. 90 A.\r\n\r\n  883 _i.e._ to the intelligible world and the One; cf. 169 C.\r\n\r\n  884 Porphyry, _On Abstinence_ 3. 5, gives a list of these sacred birds;\r\n      _e.g._ the owl sacred to Athene, the eagle to Zeus, the crane to\r\n      Demeter.\r\n\r\n  885 ἅπαντα Hertlein suggests, ἅπαντας MSS.\r\n\r\n  886 συγχωρεῖ Hertlein suggests, συγχωροίη MSS.\r\n\r\n  887 φήσει Hertlein suggests, φήσειεν MSS.\r\n\r\n  888 cf.
