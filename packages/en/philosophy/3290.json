  "content": "Valerius Terminus: of the Interpretation of Nature\r\n\r\nby Francis Bacon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface by Robert Leslie Ellis\r\n\r\nThe following fragments of a great work on the Interpretation of\r\nNature were first published in Stephens's Letters and Remains [1734].\r\nThey consist partly of detached passages, and partly of an epitome\r\nof twelve chapters of the first book of the proposed work.  The\r\ndetached passages contain the first, sixth, and eighth chapters, and\r\nportions of the fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and\r\nsixteenth.  The epitome contains an account of the contents of all\r\nthe chapters from the twelfth to the twenty-sixth inclusive, omitting\r\nthe twentieth, twentythird, and twenty-fourth.  Thus the sixteenth\r\nchapter is mentioned both in the epitome and among the detached\r\npassages, and we are thus enabled to see that the two portions of the\r\nfollowing tract belong to the same work, as it appears from both that\r\nthe sixteenth chapter was to treat of the doctrine of idola.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to ascertain the motive which determined Bacon to\r\ngive to the supposed author the name of Valerius Terminus, or to his\r\ncommentator, of whose annotations we have no remains, that of Hermes\r\nStella.  It may be conjectured that by the name Terminus he intended\r\nto intimate that the new philosophy would put an end to the wandering\r\nof mankind in search of truth, that it would be the TERMINUS AD QUEM\r\nin which when it was once attained the mind would finally acquiesce.\r\n\r\nAgain, the obscurity of the text was to be in some measure removed by\r\nthe annotations of Stella; not however wholly, for Bacon in the\r\nepitome of the eighteenth chapter commends the manner of publishing\r\nknowledge \"whereby it shall not be to the capacity nor taste of all,\r\nbut shall as it were single and adopt his reader.\"  Stella was\r\ntherefore to throw a kind of starlight on the subject, enough to\r\nprevent the student's losing his way, but not much more.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the tract is undoubtedly obscure, partly from\r\nthe style in which it is written, and partly from its being only a\r\nfragment.  It is at the same time full of interest, inasmuch as it is\r\nthe earliest type of the INSTAURATIO...\r\n\r\nNote to Preface by James Spedding:\r\n\r\nThe manuscript from which Robert Stephens printed these fragments was\r\nfound among some loose papers placed in his hands by the Earl of\r\nOxford, and is now in the British Museum; Harl. manuscripts 6462. It\r\nis a thin paper volume of the quarto size, written in the hand of one\r\nof Bacon's servants, with corrections, erasures, and interlineations\r\nin his own.\r\n\r\nThe chapters of which it consists are both imperfect in themselves\r\n(all but three),--some breaking off abruptly, others being little\r\nmore than tables of contents,--and imperfect in their connexion with\r\neach other; so much so as to suggest the idea of a number of separate\r\npapers loosely put together.  But it was not so (and the fact is\r\nimportant) that the volume itself was actually made up.  However they\r\ncame together, they are here fairly and consecutively copied out.\r\nThough it be a collection of fragments therefore, it is such a\r\ncollection as Bacon thought worthy not only of being preserved, but\r\nof being transcribed into a volume; and a particular account of it\r\nwill not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the manuscript before Bacon touched it may be thus\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n1. A titlepage, on which is written \"VALERIUS TERMINUS of the\r\nInterpretation of Nature, with the annotations of HERMES STELLA.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Chapter I. Of the limits and end of knowledge;\" with a running\r\ntitle, \"Of the Interpretation of Nature.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"The chapter immediately following the Inventory; being the 11th\r\nin order.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"A part of the 9th chapter, immediately precedent to the Inventory,\r\nand inducing the same.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"The Inventory, or an enumeration and view of inventions already\r\ndiscovered and in use, together with a note of the wants and the\r\nnature of the supplies; being the 10th chapter, and this a fragment\r\nonly of the same.\"\r\n\r\n6. Part of a chapter, not numbered, \"Of the internal and profound\r\nerrors and superstitions in the nature of the mind, and of the four\r\nsorts of Idols or fictions which offer themselves to the\r\nunderstanding in the inquisition of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n7. \"Of the impediments of knowledge; being the third chapter, the\r\npreface only of it.\"\r\n\r\n8. \"Of the impediments which have been in the times and in diversion\r\nof wits; being the fourth chapter.\"\r\n\r\n9. \"Of the impediments of knowledge for want of a true succession of\r\nwits, and that hitherto the length of one man's life hath been the\r\ngreatest measure of knowledge; being the fifth chapter.\"\r\n\r\n10. \"That the pretended succession of wits hath been evil placed,\r\nforasmuch as after variety of sects and opinions the most popular and\r\nnot the truest prevaileth and weareth out the rest; being the sixth\r\nchapter.\"\r\n\r\n11. \"Of the impediments of knowledge in handling it by parts, and in\r\nslipping off particular sciences from the root and stock of universal\r\nknowledge; being the seventh chapter.\"\r\n\r\n12. \"That the end and scope of knowledge hath been generally mistaken,\r\nand that men were never well advised what it was they sought\" (part\r\nof a chapter not numbered).\r\n\r\n13. \"An abridgment of divers chapters of the first book;\" namely, the\r\nl2th, 13th, and 14th, (over which is a running title \"Of active\r\nknowledge;\") and (without any running title) the 15th, 16th, 17th,\r\n18th], 19th, 21st, 22nd, 25th, and 26th.  These abridgments have no\r\nheadings; and at the end is written, \"The end of the Abridgment of\r\nthe first book of the Interpretation of Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the arrangement of the manuscript as the transcriber left it;\r\nwhich I have thought worth preserving, because I seem to see traces\r\nin it of two separate stages in the developement of the work; the\r\norder of the chapters as they are transcribed being probably the same\r\nin which Bacon wrote them; and the numbers inserted at the end of the\r\nheadings indicating the order in which, when he placed them in the\r\ntranscriber's hands, it was his intention to arrange them; and\r\nbecause it proves at any rate that at that time the design of the\r\nwhole book was clearly laid out in his mind.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, unfortunately, to fix the DATE of the transcript,\r\nunless it be implied in certain astronomical or astrological symbols\r\nwritten on the blank outside of the volume; in which the figures 1603\r\noccur.  This may possibly be the transcriber's note of the time when\r\nhe finished his work; for which (but for one circumstance which I\r\nshall mention presently) I should think the year 1603 is likely a\r\ndate as any; for we know from a letter of Bacon's, dated 3rd July\r\n1603, that he had at that time resolved \"to meddle as little as\r\npossible in the King's causes,\" and to \"put his ambition wholly upon\r\nhis pen;\" and we know from the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING that in 1605\r\nhe was engaged upon a work entitled \"The Interpretation of Nature:\"\r\nto which I may add that there is in the Lambeth Library a copy of a\r\nletter from Bacon to Lord Kinlosse, dated 25th March, 1603, and\r\nwritten in the same hand as this manuscript.\r\n\r\nBacon's corrections, if I may judge from the character of the\r\nhandwriting, were inserted a little later; for it is a fact that\r\nabout the beginning of James's reign his writing underwent a\r\nremarkable change, from the hurried Saxon hand full of large sweeping\r\ncurves and with letters imperfectly formed and connected, which he\r\nwrote in Elizabeth's time, to a small, neat, light, and compact one,\r\nformed more upon the Italian model which was then coming into fashion;\r\nand when these corrections were made it is evident that this new\r\ncharacter had become natural to him and easy.  It is of course\r\nimpossible to fix the precise date of such a change,--the more so\r\nbecause his autographs of this period are very scarce,--but whenever\r\nit was that he corrected this manuscript, it is evident that he then\r\nconsidered it worthy of careful revision.  He has not merely inserted\r\na sentence here and there, altered the numbers of the chapters, and\r\nadded words to the headings in order to make the description more\r\nexact; but he has taken the trouble to add the running title wherever\r\nit was wanting, thus writing the words \"of the Interpretation of\r\nNature\" at full lengths not less than eighteen times over; and upon\r\nthe blank space of the titlepage he has written out a complete table\r\nof contents.  In short, if he had been preparing the manuscript for\r\nthe press or for a fresh transcript, he could not have done it more\r\ncompletely or carefully,--only that he has given no directions for\r\naltering the order of the chapters so as to make it correspond with\r\nthe numbers.  And hence I infer that up to the time when he made\r\nthese corrections, this was the form of the great work on which he\r\nwas engaged: it was a work concerning the Interpretation of Nature;\r\nwhich was to begin where the NOVUM ORGANUM begins; and of which the\r\nfirst book was to include all the preliminary considerations\r\npreparatory to the exposition of the formula.\r\n\r\nI place this fragment here in deference to Mr. Ellis's decided\r\nopinion that it was written before the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING. The\r\npositive ground indeed which he alleges in support of that conclusion\r\nI am obliged to set aside, as founded, I think, upon a\r\nmisapprehension; and the supposition that no part of it was written\r\nlater involves a difficulty which I cannot yet get over to my own\r\nsatisfaction.  But that the body of it was written earlier I see no\r\nreason to doubt; and if so, this is its proper place.\r\n\r\nThe particular point on which I venture to disagree with Mr. Ellis I\r\nhave stated in a note upon his preface to the NOVUM ORGANUM,\r\npromising at the same time a fuller explanation of the grounds of my\r\nown conclusion, which I will now give.\r\n\r\nThe question is, whether the \"Inventory\" in the 10th chapter of\r\nVALERIUS TERMINUS was to have exhibited a general survey of the state\r\nof knowledge corresponding with that which fills the second book of\r\nthe ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING. I think not.\r\n\r\nIt is true indeed that the title of that 10th chapter,--namely, \"The\r\nInventory, or an enumeration and view of inventions already\r\ndiscovered and in use, with a note of the wants and the nature of the\r\nsupplies\",--has at first sight a considerable resemblance to the\r\ndescription of the contents of the second book of the ADVANCEMENT OF\r\nLEARNING,--namely, \"A general and faithful perambulation of learning,\r\nwith an inquiry what parts thereof lie fresh and waste, and not\r\nimproved and converted by the industry of Man;... wherein\r\nnevertheless my purpose is at this time to note only omissions and\r\ndeficiencies, and not to make any redargutions of errors,\" and so on.\r\nBut an \"enumeration of INVENTIONS\" is not the same thing as \"a\r\nperambulation of LEARNING;\" and it will be found upon closer\r\nexamination that the \"Inventory\" spoken of in VALERIUS TERMINUS does\r\nreally correspond to one, and one only, of the fiftyone Desiderata\r\nset down at the end of the DE AUGMENTIS; viz. that INVENTARIUM OPUM\r\nHUMANARUM, which was to be an appendix to the MAGIA NATURALIS. See DE\r\nAUG. iii. 5. This will appear clearly by comparing the descriptions\r\nof the two.\r\n\r\nIn the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING Bacon tells us that there are two\r\npoints of much purpose pertaining to the department of Natural Magic:\r\nthe first of which is, \"That there be made a calendar resembling an\r\nInventory of the ESTATE OF MAN, containing ALL THE INVENTIONS, BEING\r\nTHE WORKS OR FRUITS OF NATURE OR ART, which are now extant AND OF\r\nWHICH MAN IS ALREADY POSSESSED; out of which doth naturally result a\r\nnote what things are yet held impossible or not invented; which\r\ncalendar will be the more artificial and serviceable if to every\r\nreputed impossibility you add what thing is extant which cometh the\r\nnearest in degree to that impossibility: to the end that by these\r\noptatives and essentials man's inquiry may be the more awake in\r\ndeducing direction of works from the speculation of causes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inventory which was to have been inserted in the 10th chapter of\r\nVALERIUS TERMINUS is thus introduced:--\"The plainest method and most\r\ndirectly pertinent to this intention will be to make distribution of\r\nSCIENCES, ARTS, INVENTIONS, WORKS, and their portions, ACCORDING TO\r\nTHE USE AND TRIBUTE WHICH THEY YIELD AND RENDER TO THE CONDITION OF\r\nMAN'S LIFE; and under those several uses, being as several offices of\r\nprovisions, to charge and tax what may be reasonably exacted or\r\ndemanded,... and then upon those charges and taxations to distinguish\r\nand present as it were in several columns what is extant and already\r\nfound, and what is DEFECTIVE AND FURTHER TO BE PROVIDED. Of which\r\nprovisions because in many of them, after the manner of slothful and\r\nfaulty accomptants, it will be returned by way of excuse that no such\r\nare to be had, it will be fit to give some light OF THE NATURE OF THE\r\nSUPPLIES; whereby it will evidently appear that they are to be\r\ncompassed and procured.\"  And that the calendar was to deal, not with\r\nknowledge in general, but only with arts and sciences of invention in\r\nits more restricted sense--the PARS OPERATIVA DE NATURA (DE AUG. iii.\r\n5.)--appears no less clearly from the opening of the 11th chapter,\r\nwhich was designed immediately to follow the \"Inventory.\"  \"It\r\nappeareth then what is now in proposition, not by general\r\ncircumlocution but by particular note.  No former philosophy,\" etc.\r\netc. \"but the revealing and discovering of NEW INVENTIONS AND\r\nOPERATIONS,... the nature and kinds of which inventions HAVE BEEN\r\nDESCRIBED as they could be discovered,\" etc. If further evidence were\r\nrequired of the exact resemblance between the Inventory of VALERIUS\r\nTERMINUS and the Inventarium of the ADVANCEMENT and the DE AUGMENTIS,\r\nI might quote the end of the 9th chapter, where the particular\r\nexpressions correspond, if possible, more closely still.  But I\r\npresume that the passages which I have given are enough; and that the\r\nopinion which I have elsewhere expressed as to the origin of the\r\nADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING,--namely, that the writing of it was a\r\nby-thought and no part of the work on the Interpretation of Nature as\r\noriginally designed,--will not be considered inconsistent with the\r\nevidence afforded by these fragments.\r\n\r\nThat the VALERIUS TERMINUS was composed before the ADVANCEMENT,\r\nthough a conclusion not deducible from the Inventory, is nevertheless\r\nprobable: but to suppose that it was so composed EXACTLY IN ITS\r\nPRESENT FORM, involves, as I said, a difficulty; which I will now\r\nstate.  The point is interesting, as bearing directly upon the\r\ndevelopement in Bacon's mind of the doctrine of Idols; concerning\r\nwhich see preface to NOVUM ORGANUM, note C. But I have to deal with\r\nit here merely as bearing upon the probable date of this fragment.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the department of Logic in the ADVANCEMENT, Bacon\r\nnotices as altogether wanting \"the particular elenches or cautions\r\nagainst three false appearances\" or fallacies by which the mind of\r\nman is beset: the \"caution\" of which, he says, \"doth extremely import\r\nthe true conduct of human judgment.\"  These false appearances he\r\ndescribes, though he does not give their names; and they correspond\r\nrespectively to what he afterwards called the Idols of the Tribe, the\r\nCave, and the Forum.  But he makes no mention of the fourth; namely,\r\nthe Idols of the Theatre.  Now in VALERIUS TERMINUS we find two\r\nseparate passages in which the Idols are mentioned; and in both all\r\nfour are enumerated, and all by name; though what he afterwards\r\ncalled Idols of the Forum, he there calls Idols of the Palace; and it\r\nseems to me very unlikely that, if when he wrote the ADVANCEMENT he\r\nhad already formed that classification he should have omitted all\r\nmention of the Idols of the Theatre; for though it is true that that\r\nwas not the place to discuss them, and therefore in the corresponding\r\npassage of the DE AUGMENTIS they are noticed as to be passed by \"for\r\nthe present,\" yet they are noticed by name, and in all Bacon's later\r\nwritings the confutation of them holds a very prominent place.\r\n\r\nTo me the most probable explanation of the fact is this.  I have\r\nalready shown that between the composition and the transcription of\r\nthese fragments the design of the work appears to have undergone a\r\nconsiderable change; the order of the chapters being entirely altered.\r\nWe have only to suppose therefore that they were composed before\r\nthe ADVANCEMENT and transcribed after, and that in preparing them for\r\nthe transcriber Bacon made the same kind of alterations in the\r\noriginals which he afterwards made upon the transcript, and the\r\ndifficulty disappears.  Nothing would be easier than to correct\r\n\"three\" into \"four,\" and insert \"the Idols of the Theatre\" at the end\r\nof the sentence.\r\n\r\nAnd this reminds me (since I shall have so much to do with these\r\nquestions of date) to suggest a general caution with regard to them\r\nall; namely, that in the case of fragments like these, the comparison\r\nof isolated passages can hardly ever be relied upon for evidence of\r\nthe date or order of composition, or of the progressive developement\r\nof the writer's views; and for this simple reason,--we can never be\r\nsure that the passages as they now stand formed part of the original\r\nwriting.  The copy of the fragment which we have may be (as there is\r\nreason to believe this was) a transcript from several loose papers,\r\nwritten at different periods and containing alterations or additions\r\nmade from time to time.  We may know perhaps that when Bacon\r\npublished the ADVANCEMCNT OF LEARNING he was ignorant of some fact\r\nwith which he afterwards became acquainted; we may find in one of\r\nthese fragments,--say the TEMPORIS PARTUS MASCULUS,--a passage\r\nimplying acquaintance with that fact.  Does it follow that the\r\nTEMPORIS PARTUS MASCULUS was written after the ADVANCEMENT OF\r\nLEARNING?  No; for in looking over the manuscript long after it was\r\nwritten, he may have observed and corrected the error.  And we cannot\r\nconclude that he at the same time altered the whole composition so as\r\nto bring it into accordance with the views he then held; for that\r\nmight be too long a work.  He may have inserted a particular\r\ncorrection, but meant to rewrite the whole; and if so, in spite of\r\nthe later date indicated by that particular passage, the body of the\r\nwork would still represent a stage in his opinions anterior to the\r\nADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING.\r\n\r\nI have felt some doubt whether in printing this fragment, I should\r\nfollow the example of Stephens, who gave it exactly as he found it;\r\nor that of later editors, who have altered the order of the chapters\r\nso as to make it agree with the numbers.  The latter plan will\r\nperhaps, upon the whole, be the more convenient.  There can he little\r\ndoubt that the numbers of the chapters indicate the order in which\r\nBacon meant them to be read; and if any one wishes to compare it with\r\nthe order in which they seem to have been written, he has only to\r\nlook at Bacon's table of contents, which was made with reference to\r\nthe transcript, and which I give unaltered, except as to the spelling.\r\n\r\nof the Interpretation of Nature with the Annotations of a few\r\nfragments of the first book, viz.\r\n\r\n1.

The other reason   |\r\nis, because it is a singular help and a    |\r\npreservative against unbelief and error;   |\r\nfor, saith our Saviour,  YOU ERR, NOT      |\r\nKNOWING THE SCRIPTURES NOR THE             |\r\nPOWER OF GOD;{38} laying before us two     | 38.

And\r\ntherefore Titus Livius in his declamatory digression wherein he doth\r\ndepress and extenuate the honour of Alexander's conquests saith,\r\nNIHIL ALIUD QUAM BENE AUSUS VANA CONTEMNERE: in which sort of things\r\nit is the manner of men first to wonder that any such thing should be\r\npossible, and after it is found out to wonder again how the world\r\nshould miss it so long.  Of this nature I take to be the invention\r\nand discovery of knowledge, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPEDIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN IN THE TIMES, AND IN DIVERSION OF\r\nWITS, BEING THE 5TH CHAPTER, A SMALL FRAGMENT IN THE BEGINNING OF\r\nTHAT CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nThe encounters of the times have been nothing favourable and\r\nprosperous for the invention of knowledge; so as it is not only the\r\ndaintiness of the seed to take, and the ill mixture and unliking of\r\nthe ground to nourish or raise this plant, but the ill season also of\r\nthe weather by which it hath been checked and blasted.  Especially in\r\nthat the seasons have been proper to bring up and set forward other\r\nmore hasty and indifferent plants, whereby this of knowledge bath\r\nbeen starved and overgrown; for in the descent of times always there\r\nhath been somewhat else in reign and reputation, which hath generally\r\naliened and diverted wits and labours from that employment.\r\n\r\nFor as for the uttermost antiquity which is like fame that muffles\r\nher head and tells tales, I cannot presume much of it; for I would\r\nnot willingly imitate the manner of those that describe maps, which\r\nwhen they come to some far countries whereof they have no knowledge,\r\nset down how there be great wastes and deserts there: so I am not apt\r\nto affirm that they knew little, because what they knew is little\r\nknown to us.  But if you will judge of them by the last traces that\r\nremain to us, you will conclude, though not so scornfully as\r\nAristotle doth, that saith our ancestors were extreme gross, as those\r\nthat came newly from being moulded out of the clay or some earthly\r\nsubstance; yet reasonably and probably thus, that it was with them in\r\nmatter of knowledge but as the dawning or break of day.  For at that\r\ntime the world was altogether home-bred, every nation looked little\r\nbeyond their own confines or territories, and the world had no\r\nthrough lights then, as it hath had since by commerce and navigation,\r\nwhereby there could neither be that contribution of wits one to help\r\nanother, nor that variety of particulars for the correcting of\r\ncustomary conceits.\r\n\r\nAnd as there could be no great collection of wits of several parts or\r\nnations, so neither could there be any succession of wits of several\r\ntimes, whereby one might refine the other, in regard they had not\r\nhistory to any purpose.  And the manner of their traditions was\r\nutterly unfit and unproper for amplification of knowledge.  And again\r\nthe studies of those times, you shall find, besides wars, incursions,\r\nand rapines, which were then almost every where betwixt states\r\nadjoining (the use of leagues and confederacies being not then known),\r\nwere to populate by multitude of wives and generation, a thing at\r\nthis day in the waster part of the West-Indies principally affected;\r\nand to build sometimes for habitation towns and cities, sometimes for\r\nfame and memory monuments, pyramids, colosses, and the like.  And if\r\nthere happened to rise up any more civil wits; then would he found\r\nand erect some new laws, customs, and usages, such as now of late\r\nyears, when the world was revolute almost to the like rudeness and\r\nobscurity, we see both in our own nation and abroad many examples of,\r\nas well in a number of tenures reserved upon men's lands, as in\r\ndivers customs of towns and manors, being the devices that such wits\r\nwrought upon in such times of deep ignorance, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPEDIMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE FOR WANT OF A TRUE SUCCESSION OF WITS,\r\nAND THAT HITHERTO THE LENGTH OF ONE MAN'S LIFE HATH BEEN THE GREATEST\r\nMEASURE OF KNOWLEDGE, BEING THE 6TH CHAPTER, THE WHOLE CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nIn arts mechanical the first device comes shortest and time addeth\r\nand perfecteth.  But in sciences of conceit the first author goeth\r\nfurthest and time leeseth and corrupteth.  Painting, artillery,\r\nsailing, and the like, grossly managed at first, by time accommodate\r\nand refined.  The philosophies and sciences of Aristotle, Plato,\r\nDemocritus, Hippocrates, of most vigour at first, by time degenerated\r\nand imbased.  In the former many wits and industries contributed in\r\none: In the latter many men's wits spent to deprave the wit of one.\r\n\r\nThe error is both in the deliverer and in the receiver.  He that\r\ndelivereth knowledge desireth to deliver it in such form as may be\r\nsoonest believed, and not as may be easiliest examined.  He that\r\nreceiveth knowledge desireth rather present satisfaction than\r\nexpectant search, and so rather not to doubt than not to err.  Glory\r\nmaketh the author not to lay open his weakness, and sloth maketh the\r\ndisciple not to know his strength.\r\n\r\nThen begin men to aspire to the second prizes; to be a profound\r\ninterpreter and commenter, to be a sharp champion and defender, to be\r\na methodical compounder and abridger.  And this is the unfortunate\r\nsuccession of wits which the world hath yet had, whereby the\r\npatrimony of all knowledge goeth not on husbanded or improved, but\r\nwasted and decayed.  For knowledge is like a water that will never\r\narise again higher than the level from which it fell; and therefore\r\nto go beyond Aristotle by the light of Aristotle is to think that a\r\nborrowed light can increase the original light from whom it is taken.\r\nSo then no true succession of wits having been in the world, either\r\nwe must conclude that knowledge is but a task for one man's life, and\r\nthen vain was the complaint that LIFE IS SHORT, AND ART IS LONG: or\r\nelse, that the knowledge that now is, is but a shrub, and not that\r\ntree which is never dangerous, but where it is to the purpose of\r\nknowing Good and Evil; which desire ever riseth upon an appetite to\r\nelect and not to obey, and so containeth in it a manifest defection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT THE PRETENDED SUCCESSION OF WITS HATH BEEN EVIL PLACED, FOR\r\nASMUCH AS AFTER VARIETY OF SECTS AND OPINIONS, THE MOST POPULAR AND\r\nNOT THE TRUEST PREVAILETH AND WEARETH OUT THE REST; BEING THE 7TH\r\nCHAPTER; A FRAGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sensible to think that when men enter first into search and\r\ninquiry, according to the several frames and compositions of their\r\nunderstanding they light upon different conceits, and so all opinions\r\nand doubts are beaten over, and then men having made a taste of all\r\nwax weary of variety, and so reject the worst and hold themselves to\r\nthe best, either some one if it be eminent, or some two or three if\r\nthey be in some equality, which afterwards are received and carried\r\non, and the rest extinct.\r\n\r\nBut truth is contrary, and that time is like a river which carrieth\r\ndown things which are light and blown up, and sinketh and drowneth\r\nthat which is sad and weighty.  For howsoever governments have\r\nseveral forms, sometimes one governing, sometimes few, sometimes the\r\nmultitude; yet the state of knowledge is ever a DEMOCRATIE, and that\r\nprevaileth which is most agreeable to the senses and conceits of\r\npeople.  As for example there is no great doubt but he that did put\r\nthe beginnings of things to be SOLID, VOID, AND MOTION TO THE CENTRE,\r\nwas in better earnest than he that put MATTER, FORM, AND SHIFT; or he\r\nthat put the MIND, MOTION, AND MATTER. For no man shall enter into\r\ninquisition of nature, but shall pass by that opinion of Democritus,\r\nwhereas he shall never come near the other two opinions, but leave\r\nthem aloof for the schools and table-talk.  Yet those of Aristotle\r\nand Plato, because they be both agreeable to popular sense, and the\r\none was uttered with subtilty and the spirit of contradiction, and\r\nthe other with a stile of ornament and majesty, did hold out, and the\r\nother gave place, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE IMPEDIMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE IN HANDLING IT BY PARTS, AND IN\r\nSLIPPING OFF PARTICULAR SCIENCES FROM THE ROOT AND STOCK OF UNIVERSAL\r\nKNOWLEDGE, BEING THE 8TH CHAPTER, THE WHOLE CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCicero, the orator, willing to magnify his own profession, and\r\nthereupon spending many words to maintain that eloquence was not a\r\nshop of good words and elegancies but a treasury and receipt of all\r\nknowledges, so far forth as may appertain to the handling and moving\r\nof the minds and affections of men by speech, maketh great complaint\r\nof the school of Socrates; that whereas before his time the same\r\nprofessors of wisdom in Greece did pretend to teach an universal\r\nSAPIENCE and knowledge both of matter and words, Socrates divorced\r\nthem and withdrew philosophy and left rhetoric to itself, which by\r\nthat destitution became but a barren and unnoble science.  And in\r\nparticular sciences we see that if men fall to subdivide their\r\nlabours, as to be an oculist in physic, or to be perfect in some one\r\ntitle of the law, or the like, they may prove ready and subtile, but\r\nnot deep or sufficient, no not in that subject which they do\r\nparticularly attend, because of that consent which it hath with the\r\nrest.  And it is a matter of common discourse of the chain of\r\nsciences how they are linked together, insomuch as the Grecians, who\r\nhad terms at will, have fitted it of a name of CIRCLE LEARNING.\r\nNevertheless I that hold it for a great impediment towards the\r\nadvancement and further invention of knowledge, that particular arts\r\nand sciences have been disincorporated from general knowledge, do not\r\nunderstand one and the same thing which Cicero's discourse and the\r\nnote and conceit of the Grecians in their word CIRCLE LEARNING do\r\nintend.  For I mean not that use which one science hath of another\r\nfor ornament or help in practice, as the orator hath of knowledge of\r\naffections for moving, or as military science may have use of\r\ngeometry for fortifications; but I mean it directly of that use by\r\nway of supply of light and information which the particulars and\r\ninstances of one science do yield and present for the framing or\r\ncorrecting of the axioms of another science in their very truth and\r\nnotion.  And therefore that example of OCULISTS and TITLE LAWYERS\r\ndoth come nearer my conceit than the other two; for sciences\r\ndistinguished have a dependence upon universal knowledge to be\r\naugmented and rectified by the superior light thereof, as well as the\r\nparts and members of a science have upon the MAXIMS of the same\r\nscience, and the mutual light and consent which one part receiveth of\r\nanother.  And therefore the opinion of Copernicus in astronomy, which\r\nastronomy itself cannot correct because it is not repugnant to any of\r\nthe appearances, yet natural philosophy doth correct.  On the other\r\nside if some of the ancient philosophers had been perfect in the\r\nobservations of astronomy, and had called them to counsel when they\r\nmade their principles and first axioms, they would never have divided\r\ntheir philosophy as the Cosmographers do their descriptions by globes,\r\nmaking one philosophy for heaven and another for under heaven, as in\r\neffect they do.\r\n\r\nSo if the moral philosophers that have spent such an infinite\r\nquantity of debate touching Good and the highest good, had cast their\r\neye abroad upon nature and beheld the appetite that is in all things\r\nto receive and to give; the one motion affecting preservation and the\r\nother multiplication; which appetites are most evidently seen in\r\nliving creatures in the pleasure of nourishment and generation; and\r\nin man do make the aptest and most natural division of all his\r\ndesires, being either of sense of pleasure or sense of power; and in\r\nthe universal frame of the world are figured, the one in the beams of\r\nheaven which issue forth, and the other in the lap of the earth which\r\ntakes in: and again if they had observed the motion of congruity or\r\nsituation of the parts in respect of the whole, evident in so many\r\nparticulars; and lastly if they had considered the motion (familiar\r\nin attraction of things) to approach to that which is higher in the\r\nsame kind; when by these observations so easy and concurring in\r\nnatural philosophy, they should have found out this quaternion of\r\ngood, in enjoying or fruition, effecting or operation, consenting or\r\nproportion, and approach or assumption; they would have saved and\r\nabridged much of their long and wandering discourses of pleasure,\r\nvirtue, duty, and religion.  So likewise in this same logic and\r\nrhetoric, or arts of argument and grace of speech, if the great\r\nmasters of them would but have gone a form lower, and looked but into\r\nthe observations of Grammar concerning the kinds of words, their\r\nderivations, deflexions, and syntax; specially enriching the same\r\nwith the helps of several languages, with their differing proprieties\r\nof words, phrases, and tropes; they might have found out more and\r\nbetter footsteps of common reason, help of disputation, and\r\nadvantages of cavillation, than many of these which they have\r\npropounded.  So again a man should be thought to dally, if he did\r\nnote how the figures of rhetoric and music are many of them the same.\r\nThe repetitions and traductions in speech and the reports and\r\nhauntings of sounds in music are the very same things.  Plutarch hath\r\nalmost made a book of the Lacedaemonian kind of jesting, which joined\r\never pleasure with distaste.  SIR, (saith a man of art to Philip king\r\nof Macedon when he controlled him in his faculty,) GOD FORBID YOUR\r\nFORTUNE SHOULD BE SUCH AS TO KNOW THESE THINGS BETTER THAN I. In\r\ntaxing his ignorance in his art he represented to him the perpetual\r\ngreatness of his fortune, leaving him no vacant time for so mean a\r\nskill.  Now in music it is one of the ordinariest flowers to fall\r\nfrom a discord or hard tune upon a sweet accord.  The figure that\r\nCicero and the rest commend as one of the best points of elegancy,\r\nwhich is the fine checking of expectation, is no less well known to\r\nthe musicians when they have a special grace in flying the close or\r\ncadence.  And these are no allusions but direct communities, the same\r\ndelights of the mind being to be found not only in music, rhetoric,\r\nbut in moral philosophy, policy, and other knowledges, and that\r\nobscure in the one, which is more apparent in the other, yea and that\r\ndiscovered in the one which is not found at all in the other, and so\r\none science greatly aiding to the invention and augmentation of\r\nanother.  And therefore without this intercourse the axioms of\r\nsciences will fall out to be neither full nor true; but will be such\r\nopinions as Aristotle in some places doth wisely censure, when he\r\nsaith THESE ARE THE OPINIONS OF PERSONS THAT HAVE RESPECT BUT TO A\r\nFEW THINGS. So then we see that this note leadeth us to an\r\nadministration of knowledge in some such order and policy as the king\r\nof Spain in regard of his great dominions useth in state; who though\r\nhe hath particular councils for several countries and affairs, yet\r\nhath one council of State or last resort, that receiveth the\r\nadvertisements and certificates from all the rest.  Hitherto of the\r\ndiversion, succession, and conference of wits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT THE END AND SCOPE OF KNOWLEDGE HATH BEEN GENERALLY MISTAKEN, AND\r\nTHAT MEN WERE NEVER WELL ADVISED WHAT IT WAS THEY SOUGHT; BEING THE\r\n9TH CHAPTER, WHEREOF A FRAGMENT (WHICH IS THE END OF THE SAME\r\nCHAPTER) IS BEFORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appeareth then how rarely the wits and labours of men have been\r\nconverted to the severe and original inquisition of knowledge; and in\r\nthose who have pretended, what hurt hath been done by the affectation\r\nof professors and the distraction of such as were no professors; and\r\nhow there was never in effect any conjunction or combination of wits\r\nin the first and inducing search, but that every man wrought apart,\r\nand would either have his own way or else would go no further than\r\nhis guide, having in the one case the honour of a first, and in the\r\nother the ease of a second; and lastly how in the descent and\r\ncontinuance of wits and labours the succession hath been in the most\r\npopular and weak opinions, like unto the weakest natures which many\r\ntimes have most children, and in them also the condition of\r\nsuccession hath been rather to defend and to adorn than to add; and\r\nif to add, yet that addition to be rather a refining of a part than\r\nan increase of the whole.  But the impediments of time and accidents,\r\nthough they have wrought a general indisposition, yet are they not so\r\nperemptory and binding as the internal impediments and clouds in the\r\nmind and spirit of man, whereof it now followeth to speak.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture speaking of the worst sort of error saith, ERRARE FECIT\r\nCOS IN INVIO ET NON IN VIA. For a man may wander in the way, by\r\nrounding up and down.  But if men have failed in their very direction\r\nand address that error will never by good fortune correct itself.\r\nNow it hath fared with men in their contemplations as Seneca saith it\r\nfareth with them in their actions, DE PARTIBUS VITAE QUISQUE\r\nDELIBERAT, DE SUMMA NEMO. A course very ordinary with men who receive\r\nfor the most part their final ends from the inclination of their\r\nnature, or from common example and opinion, never questioning or\r\nexamining them, nor reducing them to any clear certainty; and use\r\nonly to call themselves to account and deliberation touching the\r\nmeans and second ends, and thereby set themselves in the right way to\r\nthe wrong place.  So likewise upon the natural curiosity and desire\r\nto know, they have put themselves in way without foresight or\r\nconsideration of their journey's end.\r\n\r\nFor I find that even those that have sought knowledge for itself, and\r\nnot for benefit or ostentation or any practical enablement in the\r\ncourse of their life, have nevertheless propounded to themselves a\r\nwrong mark, namely satisfaction (which men call truth) and not\r\noperation.  For as in the courts and services of princes and states\r\nit is a much easier matter to give satisfaction than to do the\r\nbusiness; so in the inquiring of causes and reasons it is much easier\r\nto find out such causes as will satisfy the mind of man and quiet\r\nobjections, than such causes as will direct him and give him light to\r\nnew experiences and inventions.  And this did Celsus note wisely and\r\ntruly, how that the causes which are in use and whereof the\r\nknowledges now received do consist, were in time minors and\r\nsubsequents to the knowledge of the particulars out of which they\r\nwere induced and collected; and that it was not the light of those\r\ncauses which discovered particulars, but only the particulars being\r\nfirst found, men did fall on glossing and discoursing of the causes;\r\nwhich is the reason why the learning that now is hath the curse of\r\nbarrenness, and is courtesanlike, for pleasure, and not for fruit.\r\nNay to compare it rightly, the strange fiction of the poets of the\r\ntransformation of Scylla seemeth to be a lively emblem of this\r\nphilosophy and knowledge; a fair woman upwards in the parts of show,\r\nbut when you come to the parts of use and generation, Barking\r\nMonsters; for no better are the endless distorted questions, which\r\never have been, and of necessity must be, the end and womb of such\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nBut yet nevertheless here I may be mistaken, by reason of some which\r\nhave much in their pen the referring sciences to action and the use\r\nof man, which mean quite another matter than I do.  For they mean a\r\ncontriving of directions and precepts for readiness of practice,\r\nwhich I discommend not, so it be not occasion that some quantity of\r\nthe science be lost; for else it will be such a piece of husbandry as\r\nto put away a manor lying somewhat scattered, to buy in a close that\r\nlieth handsomely about a dwelling.  But my intention contrariwise is\r\nto increase and multiply the revenues and possessions of man, and not\r\nto trim up only or order with conveniency the grounds whereof he is\r\nalready stated.  Wherefore the better to make myself understood that\r\nI mean nothing less than words, and directly to demonstrate the point\r\nwhich we are now upon, that is, what is the true end, scope, or\r\noffice of knowledge, which I have set down to consist not in any\r\nplausible, delectable, reverend, or admired discourse, or any\r\nsatisfactory arguments, but in effecting and working, and in\r\ndiscovery of particulars not revealed before for the better endowment\r\nand help of man's life; I have thought good to make as it were a\r\nKalendar or Inventory of the wealth, furniture, or means of man\r\naccording to his present estate, as far as it is known; which I do\r\nnot to shew any universality of sense or knowledge, and much less to\r\nmake a satire of reprehension in respect of wants and errors, but\r\npartly because cogitations new had need of some grossness and\r\ninculcation to make them perceived; and chiefly to the end that for\r\nthe time to come (upon the account and state now made and cast up) it\r\nmay appear what increase this new manner of use and administration of\r\nthe stock (if it be once planted) shall bring with it hereafter; and\r\nfor the time present (in case I should be prevented by death to\r\npropound and reveal this new light as I purpose) yet I may at the\r\nleast give some awaking note both of the wants in man's present\r\ncondition and the nature of the supplies to be wished; though for\r\nmine own part neither do I much build upon my present anticipations,\r\nneither do I think ourselves yet learned or wise enough to wish\r\nreasonably: for as it asks some knowledge to demand a question not\r\nimpertinent, so it asketh some sense to make a wish not absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTORY, OR AN ENUMERATION AND VIEW OF INVENTIONS ALREADY\r\nDISCOVERED AND IN USE, TOGETHER WITH A NOTE OF THE WANTS AND THE\r\nNATURE OF THE SUPPLIES, BEING THE 10TH CHAPTER; AND THIS A SMALL\r\nFRAGMENT THEREOF, BEING THE PREFACE TO THE INVENTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plainest method and most directly pertinent to this intention,\r\nwill be to make distribution of sciences, arts, inventions, works,\r\nand their portions, according to the use and tribute which they yield\r\nand render to the conditions of man's life, and under those several\r\nuses, being as several offices of provisions, to charge and tax what\r\nmay be reasonably exacted or demanded; not guiding ourselves neither\r\nby the poverty of experiences and probations, nor according to the\r\nvanity of credulous imaginations; and then upon those charges and\r\ntaxations to distinguish and present, as it were in several columns,\r\nwhat is extant and already found, and what is defective and further\r\nto be provided.  Of which provisions, because in many of them after\r\nthe manner of slothful and faulty officers and accomptants it will be\r\nreturned (by way of excuse) that no such are to be had, it will be\r\nfit to give some light of the nature of the supplies, whereby it will\r\nevidently appear that they are to be compassed and procured.  And yet\r\nnevertheless on the other side again it will be as fit to check and\r\ncontrol the vain and void assignations and gifts whereby certain\r\nignorant, extravagant, and abusing wits have pretended to indue the\r\nstate of man with wonders, differing as much from truth in nature as\r\nCaesar's Commentaries differeth from the acts of King Arthur or Huon\r\nof Bourdeaux in story.  For it is true that Caesar did greater things\r\nthan those idle wits had the audacity to feign their supposed\r\nworthies to have done; but he did them not in that monstrous and\r\nfabulous manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPTER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INVENTORY; BEING THE 11TH IN\r\nORDER; A PART THEREOF.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appeareth then what is now in proposition not by general\r\ncircumlocution but by particular note.  No former philosophy varied\r\nin terms or method; no new PLACET or speculation upon particulars\r\nalready known; no referring to action by any manual of practice; but\r\nthe revealing and discovering of new inventions and operations.  This\r\nto be done without the errors and conjectures of art, or the length\r\nor difficulties of experience; the nature and kinds of which\r\ninventions have been described as they could be discovered; for your\r\neye cannot pass one kenning without further sailing; only we have\r\nstood upon the best advantages of the notions received, as upon a\r\nmount, to shew the knowledges adjacent and confining.  If therefore\r\nthe true end of knowledge not propounded hath bred large error, the\r\nbest and perfectest condition of the same end not perceived will\r\ncause some declination.  For when the butt is set up men need not\r\nrove, but except the white be placed men cannot level.  This\r\nperfection we mean not in the worth of the effect, but in the nature\r\nof the direction; for our purpose is not to stir up men's hopes, but\r\nto guide their travels.  The fullness of direction to work and\r\nproduce any effect consisteth in two conditions, certainty and\r\nliberty.  Certainty is when the direction is not only true for the\r\nmost part, but infallible.  Liberty is when the direction is not\r\nrestrained to some definite means, but comprehendeth all the means\r\nand ways possible; for the poet saith well SAPIENTIBUS UNDIQUE LATAE\r\nSUNT VIAE, and where there is the greatest plurality of change, there\r\nis the greatest singularity of choice.  Besides as a conjectural\r\ndirection maketh a casual effect, so a particular and restrained\r\ndirection is no less casual than an uncertain.  For those particular\r\nmeans whereunto it is tied may be out of your power or may be\r\naccompanied with an overvalue of prejudice; and so if for want of\r\ncertainty in direction you are frustrated in success, for want of\r\nvariety in direction you are stopped in attempt.  If therefore your\r\ndirection be certain, it must refer you and point you to somewhat\r\nwhich, if it be present, the effect you seek will of necessity follow,\r\nelse may you perform and not obtain.  If it be free, then must it\r\nrefer you to somewhat which if it be absent the effect you seek will\r\nof necessity withdraw, else may you have power and not attempt.  This\r\nnotion Aristotle had in light, though not in use.  For the two\r\ncommended rules by him set down, whereby the axioms of sciences are\r\nprecepted to be made convertible, and which the latter men have not\r\nwithout elegancy surnamed the one the rule of truth because it\r\npreventeth deceit, the other the rule of prudence because it freeth\r\nelection, are the same thing in speculation and affirmation which we\r\nnow observe.  An example will make my meaning attained, and yet\r\npercase make it thought that they attained it not.  Let the effect to\r\nbe produced be Whiteness; let the first direction be that if air and\r\nwater be intermingled or broken in small portions together, whiteness\r\nwill ensue, as in snow, in the breaking of the waves of the sea and\r\nrivers, and the like.  This direction is certain, but very particular\r\nand restrained, being tied but to air and water.  Let the second\r\ndirection be, that if air be mingled as before with any transparent\r\nbody, such nevertheless as is uncoloured and more grossly transparent\r\nthan air itself, that then etc. as glass or crystal, being beaten to\r\nfine powder, by the interposition of the air becometh white; the\r\nwhite of an egg being clear of itself, receiving air by agitation\r\nbecometh white, receiving air by concoction becometh white; here you\r\nare freed from water, and advanced to a clear body, and still tied to\r\nair.  Let the third direction exclude or remove the restraint of an\r\nuncoloured body, as in amber, sapphires, etc. which beaten to fine\r\npowder become white; in wine and beer, which brought to froth become\r\nwhite.  Let the fourth direction exclude the restraint of a body more\r\ngrossly transparent than air, as in flame, being a body compounded\r\nbetween air and a finer substance than air; which flame if it were\r\nnot for the smoke, which is the third substance that incorporateth\r\nitself and dyeth the flame, would be more perfect white.  In all\r\nthese four directions air still beareth a part.  Let the fifth\r\ndirection then be, that if any bodies, both transparent but in an\r\nunequal degree, be mingled as before, whiteness will follow; as oil\r\nand water beaten to an ointment, though by settling the air which\r\ngathereth in the agitation be evaporate, yet remaineth white; and the\r\npowder of glass or crystal put into water, whereby the air giveth\r\nplace, yet remaineth white, though not so perfect.  Now are you freed\r\nfrom air, but still you are tied to transparent bodies.  To ascend\r\nfurther by scale I do forbear, partly because it would draw on the\r\nexample to an over-great length, but chiefly because it would open\r\nthat which in this work I determine to reserve; for to pass through\r\nthe whole history and observation of colours and objects visible were\r\ntoo long a digression; and our purpose is now to give an example of a\r\nfree direction, thereby to distinguish and describe it; and not to\r\nset down a form of interpretation how to recover and attain it.  But\r\nas we intend not now to reveal, so we are circumspect not to mislead;\r\nand therefore (this warning being given) returning to our purpose in\r\nhand, we admit the sixth direction to be, that all bodies or parts of\r\nbodies which are unequal equally, that is in a simple proportion, do\r\nrepresent whiteness; we will explain this, though we induce it not.\r\nIt is then to be understood, that absolute equality produceth\r\ntransparence, inequality in simple order or proportion produceth\r\nwhiteness, inequality in compound or respective order or proportion\r\nproduceth all other colours, and absolute or orderless inequality\r\nproduceth blackness; which diversity, if so gross a demonstration be\r\nneedful, may be signified by four tables; a blank, a chequer, a fret,\r\nand a medley; whereof the fret is evident to admit great variety.\r\nOut of this assertion are satisfied a multitude of effects and\r\nobservations, as that whiteness and blackness are most incompatible\r\nwith transparence; that whiteness keepeth light, and blackness\r\nstoppeth light, but neither passeth it; that whiteness or blackness\r\nare never produced in rainbows, diamonds, crystals, and the like;\r\nthat white giveth no dye, and black hardly taketh dye; that whiteness\r\nseemeth to have an affinity with dryness, and blackness with moisture;\r\nthat adustion causeth blackness, and calcination whiteness; that\r\nflowers are generally of fresh colours, and rarely black, etc. All\r\nwhich I do now mention confusedly by way of derivation and not by way\r\nof induction.  This sixth direction, which I have thus explained, is\r\nof good and competent liberty for whiteness fixed and inherent, but\r\nnot for whiteness fantastical or appearing, as shall be afterwards\r\ntouched.  But first do you need a reduction back to certainty or\r\nverity; for it is not all position or contexture of unequal bodies\r\nthat will produce colour; for AQUA FORTIS, oil of VITRIOL, etc. more\r\nmanifestly, and many other substances more obscurely, do consist of\r\nvery unequal parts, which yet are transparent and clear.  Therefore\r\nthe reduction must be, that the bodies or parts of bodies so\r\nintermingled as before be of a certain grossness or magnitude; for\r\nthe unequalities which move the sight must have a further dimension\r\nand quantity than those which operate many other effects.  Some few\r\ngrains of saffron will give a tincture to a tun of water; but so many\r\ngrains of civet will give a perfume to a whole chamber of air.  And\r\ntherefore when Democritus (from whom Epicurus did borrow it) held\r\nthat the position of the solid portions was the cause of colours, yet\r\nin the very truth of his assertion he should have added, that the\r\nportions are required to be of some magnitude.  And this is one cause\r\nwhy colours have little inwardness and necessitude with the nature\r\nand proprieties of things, those things resembling in colour which\r\notherwise differ most, as salt and sugar, and contrariwise differing\r\nin colour which otherwise resemble most, as the white and blue\r\nviolets, and the several veins of one agate or marble, by reason that\r\nother virtues consist in more subtile proportions than colours do;\r\nand yet are there virtues and natures which require a grosser\r\nmagnitude than colours, as well as scents and divers other require a\r\nmore subtile; for as the portion of a body will give forth scent\r\nwhich is too small to be seen, so the portion of a body will shew\r\ncolours which is too small to be endued with weight; and therefore\r\none of the prophets with great elegancy describing how all creatures\r\ncarry no proportion towards God the creator, saith, THAT ALL THE\r\nNATIONS IN RESPECT OF HIM ARE LIKE THE DUST UPON THE BALANCE, which\r\nis a thing appeareth but weigheth not.  But to return, there resteth\r\na further freeing of this sixth direction; for the clearness of a\r\nriver or stream sheweth white at a distance, and crystalline glasses\r\ndeliver the face or any other object falsified in whiteness, and long\r\nbeholding the snow to a weak eye giveth an impression of azure rather\r\nthan of whiteness.  So as for whiteness in apparition only and\r\nrepresentation by the qualifying of the light, altering the\r\nINTERMEDIUM, or affecting the eye itself, it reacheth not.  But you\r\nmust free your direction to the producing of such an incidence,\r\nimpression, or operation, as may cause a precise and determinate\r\npassion of the eye; a matter which is much more easy to induce than\r\nthat which we have passed through; but yet because it hath a full\r\ncoherence both with that act of radiation (which hath hitherto been\r\nconceived and termed so unproperly and untruly by some an effluxion\r\nof spiritual species and by others an investing of the INTERMEDIUM\r\nwith a motion which successively is conveyed to the eye) and with the\r\nact of sense, wherein I should likewise open that which I think good\r\nto withdraw, I will omit.  Neither do I contend but that this motion\r\nwhich I call the freeing of a direction, in the received philosophies\r\n(as far as a swimming anticipation could take hold) might be\r\nperceived and discerned; being not much other matter than that which\r\nthey did not only aim at in the two rules of AXIOMS before remembered,\r\nbut more nearly also in that which they term the form or formal\r\ncause, or that which they call the true difference; both which\r\nnevertheless it seemeth they propound rather as impossibilities and\r\nwishes than as things within the compass of human comprehension.  For\r\nPlato casteth his burden and saith THAT HE WILL REVERE HIM AS A GOD,\r\nTHAT CAN TRULY DIVIDE AND DEFINE; which cannot be but by true forms\r\nand differences.  Wherein I join hands with him, confessing as much\r\nas yet assuming to myself little; for if any man call by the strength\r\nof his ANTICIPATIONS find out forms, I will magnify him with the\r\nforemost.  But as any of them would say that if divers things which\r\nmany men know by instruction and observation another knew by\r\nrevelation and without those means, they would take him for somewhat\r\nsupernatural and divine; so I do acknowledge that if any man can by\r\nanticipations reach to that which a weak and inferior wit may attain\r\nto by interpretation, he cannot receive too high a title.  Nay I for\r\nmy part do indeed admire to see how far some of them have proceeded\r\nby their ANTICIPATIONS; but how?  It is as I wonder at some blind men,\r\nto see what shift they make without their eye-sight; thinking with\r\nmyself that if I were blind I could hardly do it.  Again Aristotle's\r\nschool confesseth that there is no true knowledge but by causes, no\r\ntrue cause but the form, no true form known except one, which they\r\nare pleased to allow; and therefore thus far their evidence standeth\r\nwith us, that both hitherto there hath been nothing but a shadow of\r\nknowledge, and that we propound now that which is agreed to be\r\nworthiest to be sought, and hardest to be found.  There wanteth now a\r\npart very necessary, not by way of supply but by way of caution; for\r\nas it is seen for the most part that the outward tokens and badges of\r\nexcellency and perfection are more incident to things merely\r\ncounterfeit than to that which is true, but for a meaner and baser\r\nsort; as a dubline is more like a perfect ruby than a spinel, and a\r\ncounterfeit angel is made more like a true angel than if it were an\r\nangel coined of China gold; in like manner the direction carrieth a\r\nresemblance of a true direction in verity and liberty which indeed is\r\nno direction at all.  For though your direction seem to be certain\r\nand free by pointing you to a nature that is unseparable from the\r\nnature you inquire upon, yet if it do not carry you on a degree or\r\nremove nearer to action, operation, or light to make or produce, it\r\nis but superficial and counterfeit.  Wherefore to secure and warrant\r\nwhat is a true direction, though that general note I have given be\r\nperspicuous in itself (for a man shall soon cast with himself whether\r\nhe be ever the nearer to effect and operate or no, or whether he have\r\nwon but an abstract or varied notion) yet for better instruction I\r\nwill deliver three particular notes of caution.  The first is that\r\nthe nature discovered be more original than the nature supposed, and\r\nnot more secondary or of the like degree; as to make a stone bright\r\nor to make it smooth it is a good direction to say, make it even; but\r\nto make a stone even it is no good direction to say, make it bright\r\nor make it smooth; for the rule is that the disposition of any thing\r\nreferring to the state of it in itself or the parts, is more original\r\nthan that which is relative or transitive towards another thing.  So\r\nevenness is the disposition of the stone in itself, but smooth is to\r\nthe hand and bright to the eye, and yet nevertheless they all cluster\r\nand concur; and yet the direction is more unperfect, if it do appoint\r\nyou to such a relative as is in the same kind and not in a diverse.\r\nFor in the direction to produce brightness by smoothness, although\r\nproperly it win no degree, and will never teach you any new\r\nparticulars before unknown; yet by way of suggestion or bringing to\r\nmind it may draw your consideration to some particulars known but not\r\nremembered; as you shall sooner remember some practical means of\r\nmaking smoothness, than if you had fixed your consideration only upon\r\nbrightness by making reflexion, as thus, make it such as you may see\r\nyour face in it, this is merely secondary, and helpeth neither by way\r\nof informing nor by way of suggestion.  So if in the inquiry of\r\nwhiteness you were directed to make such a colour as should be seen\r\nfurthest in a dark light; here you are advanced nothing at all.  For\r\nthese kinds of natures are but proprieties, effects, circumstances,\r\nconcurrences, or what else you shall like to call them, and not\r\nradical and formative natures towards the nature supposed.  The\r\nsecond caution is that the nature inquired be collected by division\r\nbefore composition, or to speak more properly, by composition\r\nsubaltern before you ascend to composition absolute, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE INTERNAL AND PROFOUND ERRORS AND SUPERSTITIONS IN THE NATURE\r\nOF THE MIND, AND OF THE FOUR SORTS OF IDOLS OR FICTIONS WHICH OFFER\r\nTHEMSELVES TO THE UNDERSTANDING IN THE INQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE;\r\nBEING THE 16TH CHAPTER, AND THIS A SMALL FRAGMENT THEREOF, BEING A\r\nPREFACE TO THE INWARD ELENCHES OF THE MIND.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Epicurus that the gods were of human shape, was rather\r\njustly derided than seriously confuted by the other sects, demanding\r\nwhether every kind of sensible creatures did not think their own\r\nfigure fairest, as the horse, the bull, and the like, which found no\r\nbeauty but in their own forms, as in appetite of lust appeared.  And\r\nthe heresy of the Anthropomorphites was ever censured for a gross\r\nconceit bred in the obscure cells of solitary monks that never looked\r\nabroad.  Again the fable so well known of QUIS PINXIT LEONEM, doth\r\nset forth well that there is an error of pride and partiality, as\r\nwell as of custom and familiarity.  The reflexion also from glasses\r\nso usually resembled to the imagery of the mind, every man knoweth to\r\nreceive error and variety both in colour, magnitude, and shape,\r\naccording to the quality of the glass.  But yet no use hath been made\r\nof these and many the like observations, to move men to search out\r\nand upon search to give true cautions of the native and inherent\r\nerrors in the mind of man which have coloured and corrupted all his\r\nnotions and impressions.\r\n\r\nI do find therefore in this enchanted glass four Idols or false\r\nappearances of several and distinct sorts, every sort comprehending\r\nmany subdivisions: the first sort, I call idols of the NATION or\r\nTRIBE; the second, idols of the PALACE; the third, idols of the CAVE;\r\nand the fourth, idols of the THEATRE, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE FOLLOWETH AN ABRIDGMENT OF DIVERS CHAPTERS OF THE FIRST BOOK OF\r\nINTERPRETATION OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat in deciding and determining of the truth of knowledge, men have\r\nput themselves upon trials not competent.  That antiquity and\r\nauthority; common and confessed notions; the natural and yielding\r\nconsent of the mind; the harmony and coherence of a knowledge in\r\nitself; the establishing of principles with the touch and reduction\r\nof other propositions unto them; inductions without instances\r\ncontradictory; and the report of the senses; are none of them\r\nabsolute and infallible evidence of truth, and bring no security\r\nsufficient for effects and operations.  That the discovery of new\r\nworks and active directions not known before, is the only trial to be\r\naccepted of; and yet not that neither, in ease where one particular\r\ngiveth light to another; but where particulars induce an axiom or\r\nobservation, which axiom found out discovereth and designeth new\r\nparticulars.  That the nature of this trial is not only upon the\r\npoint, whether the knowledge be profitable or no, but even upon the\r\npoint whether the knowledge be true or no; not because you may always\r\nconclude that the Axiom which discovereth new instances is true, but\r\ncontrariwise you may safely conclude that if it discover not any new\r\ninstance it is in vain and untrue.  That by new instances are not\r\nalways to be understood new recipes but new assignations, and of the\r\ndiversity between these two.  That the subtilty of words, arguments,\r\nnotions, yea of the senses themselves, is but rude and gross in\r\ncomparison of the subtilty of things; and of the slothful and\r\nflattering opinions of those which pretend to honour the mind of man\r\nin withdrawing and abstracting it from particulars, and of the\r\ninducements and motives whereupon such opinions have been conceived\r\nand received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the error in propounding chiefly the search of causes and\r\nproductions of things concrete, which are infinite and transitory,\r\nand not of abstract natures, which are few and permanent.  That these\r\nnatures are as the alphabet or simple letters, whereof the variety of\r\nthings consisteth; or as the colours mingled in the painter's shell,\r\nwherewith he is able to make infinite variety of faces or shapes.  An\r\nenumeration of them according to popular note.  That at the first one\r\nwould conceive that in the schools by natural philosophy were meant\r\nthe knowledge of the efficients of things concrete; and by metaphysic\r\nthe knowledge of the forms of natures simple; which is a good and fit\r\ndivision of knowledge: but upon examination there is no such matter\r\nby them intended.  That the little inquiry into the production of\r\nsimple natures sheweth well that works were not sought; because by\r\nthe former knowledge some small and superficial deflexions from the\r\nordinary generations and productions may be found out, but the\r\ndiscovery of all profound and radical alteration must arise out of\r\nthe latter knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the error in propounding the search of the materials or dead\r\nbeginnings or principles of things, and not the nature of motions,\r\ninclinations, and applications.  That the whole scope of the former\r\nsearch is impertinent and vain; both because there are no such\r\nbeginnings, and if there were they could not be known.  That the\r\nlatter manner of search (which is all) they pass over compendiously\r\nand slightly as a by-matter.  That the several conceits in that kind,\r\nas that the lively and moving beginnings of things should be shift or\r\nappetite of matter to privation; the spirit of the world working in\r\nmatter according to platform; the proceeding or fructifying of\r\ndistinct kinds according to their proprieties; the intercourse of the\r\nelements by mediation of their common qualities; the appetite of like\r\nportions to unite themselves; amity and discord, or sympathy and\r\nantipathy; motion to the centre, with motion of stripe or press; the\r\ncasual agitation, aggregation, and essays of the solid portions in\r\nthe void space; motion of shuttings and openings; are all mere\r\nnugations; and that the calculating and ordination of the true\r\ndegrees, moments, limits, and laws of motions and alterations (by\r\nmeans whereof all works and effects are produced), is a matter of a\r\nfar other nature than to consist in such easy and wild generalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the great error of inquiring knowledge in Anticipations.  That I\r\ncall Anticipations the voluntary collections that the mind maketh of\r\nknowledge; which is every man's reason.  That though this be a solemn\r\nthing, and serves the turn to negotiate between man and man (because\r\nof the conformity and participation of men's minds in the like\r\nerrors), yet towards inquiry of the truth of things and works it is\r\nof no value.  That civil respects are a lett that this pretended\r\nreason should not be so contemptibly spoken of as were fit and\r\nmedicinable, in regard that hath been too much exalted and glorified,\r\nto the infinite detriment of man's estate.  Of the nature of words\r\nand their facility and aptness to cover and grace the defects of\r\nAnticipations.  That it is no marvel if these Anticipations have\r\nbrought forth such diversity and repugnance in opinions, theories, or\r\nphilosophies, as so many fables of several arguments.  That had not\r\nthe nature of civil customs and government been in most times\r\nsomewhat adverse to such innovations, though contemplative, there\r\nmight have been and would have been many more.  That the second\r\nschool of the Academics and the sect of Pyrrho, or the considerers\r\nthat denied comprehension, as to the disabling of man's knowledge\r\n(entertained in Anticipations) is well to be allowed, but that they\r\nought when they had overthrown and purged the floor of the ruins to\r\nhave sought to build better in place.  And more especially that they\r\ndid unjustly and prejudicially to charge the deceit upon the report\r\nof the senses, which admitteth very sparing remedy; being indeed to\r\nhave been charged upon the Anticipations of the mind, which admitteth\r\na perfect remedy.  That the information of the senses is sufficient,\r\nnot because they err not, but because the use of the sense in\r\ndiscovering of knowledge is for the most part not immediate.  So that\r\nit is the work, effect, or instance, that trieth the Axiom, and the\r\nsense doth but try the work done or not done, being or not being.\r\nThat the mind of man in collecting knowledge needeth great variety of\r\nhelps, as well as the hand of man in manual and mechanical practices\r\nneedeth great variety of instruments.  And that it were a poor work\r\nthat if instruments were removed men would overcome with their naked\r\nhands.  And of the distinct points of want and insufficiency in the\r\nmind of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the mind of a man, as it is not a vessel of that content or\r\nreceipt to comprehend knowledge without helps and supplies, so again\r\nit is not sincere, but of an ill and corrupt tincture.  Of the\r\ninherent and profound errors and superstitions in the nature of the\r\nmind, and of the four sorts of Idols or false appearances that offer\r\nthemselves to the understanding in the inquisition of knowledge; that\r\nis to say, the Idols of the Tribe, the Idols of the Palace, the Idols\r\nof the Cave, and the Idols of the Theatre.  That these four, added to\r\nthe incapacity of the mind and the vanity and malignity of the\r\naffections, leave nothing but impotency and confusion.  A recital of\r\nthe particular kinds of these four Idols, with some chosen examples\r\nof the opinions they have begot, such of them as have supplanted the\r\nstate of knowledge most.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the errors of such as have descended and applied themselves to\r\nexperience, and attempted to induce knowledge upon particulars.  That\r\nthey have not had the resolution and strength of mind to free\r\nthemselves wholly from Anticipations, but have made a confusion and\r\nintermixture of Anticipations and observations, and so vanished.\r\nThat if any have had the strength of mind generally to purge away and\r\ndischarge all Anticipations, they have not had that greater and\r\ndouble strength and patience of mind, as well to repel new\r\nAnticipations after the view and search of particulars, as to reject\r\nold which were in their mind before; but have from particulars and\r\nhistory flown up to principles without the mean degrees, and so\r\nframed all the middle generalities or axioms, not by way of scale or\r\nascension from particulars, but by way of derivation from principles;\r\nwhence hath issued the infinite chaos of shadows and notions,\r\nwherewith both books and minds have been hitherto, and may be yet\r\nhereafter much more pestered.  That in the course of those\r\nderivations, to make them yet the more unprofitable, they have used\r\nwhen any light of new instance opposite to any assertion appeared,\r\nrather to reconcile the instance than to amend the rule.  That if any\r\nhave had or shall have the power and resolution to fortify and\r\ninclose his mind against all Anticipations, yet if he have not been\r\nor shall not be cautioned by the full understanding of the nature of\r\nthe mind and spirit of man, and therein of the seats, pores and\r\npassages both of knowledge and error, he hath not been nor shall not\r\nbe possibly able to guide or keep on his course aright.  That those\r\nthat have been conversant in experience and observation have used,\r\nwhen they have intended to discover the cause of any effect, to fix\r\ntheir consideration narrowly and exactly upon that effect itself with\r\nall the circumstances thereof, and to vary the trial thereof as many\r\nways as can be devised; which course amounteth but to a tedious\r\ncuriosity, and ever breaketh off in wondering and not in knowing; and\r\nthat they have not used to enlarge their observation to match and\r\nsort that effect with instances of a diverse subject, which must of\r\nnecessity be before any cause be found out.  That they have passed\r\nover the observation of instances vulgar and ignoble, and stayed\r\ntheir attention chiefly upon instances of mark; whereas the other\r\nsort are for the most part more significant and of better height and\r\ninformation.  That every particular that worketh any effect is a\r\nthing compounded (more or less) of diverse single natures, (more\r\nmanifest and more obscure,) and that it appeareth not to whether of\r\nthe natures the effect is to be ascribed, and yet notwithstanding\r\nthey have taken a course without breaking particulars and reducing\r\nthem by exclusions and inclusions to a definite point, to conclude\r\nupon inductions in gross, which empirical course is no less vain than\r\nthe scholastical.  That all such as have sought action and work out\r\nof their inquiry have been hasty and pressing to discover some\r\npractices for present use, and not to discover Axioms, joining with\r\nthem the new assignations as their sureties.  That the forerunning of\r\nthe mind to frame recipes upon Axioms at the entrance, is like\r\nAtalanta's golden ball that hindereth and interrupteth the course,\r\nand is to be inhibited till you have ascended to a certain stage and\r\ndegree of generalities; which forbearance will be liberally\r\nrecompensed in the end; and that chance discovereth new inventions by\r\none and one, but science by knots and clusters.  That they have not\r\ncollected sufficient quantity of particulars, nor them in sufficient\r\ncertainty and subtilty, nor of all several kinds, nor with those\r\nadvantages and discretions in the entry and sorting which are\r\nrequisite; and of the weak manner of collecting natural history which\r\nhath been used.  Lastly that they had no knowledge of the formulary\r\nof interpretation, the work whereof is to abridge experience and to\r\nmake things as certainly found out by Axiom in short time, as by\r\ninfinite experiences in ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the cautels and devices put in practice in the delivery of\r\nknowledge for the covering and palliating of ignorance, and the\r\ngracing and overvaluing of that they utter, are without number; but\r\nnone more bold and more hurtful than two; the one that men have used\r\nof a few observations upon any subject to make a solemn and formal\r\nart, by filling it up with discourse, accommodating it with some\r\ncircumstances and directions to practice, and digesting it into\r\nmethod, whereby men grow satisfied and secure, as if no more inquiry\r\nwere to be made of that matter; the other, that men have used to\r\ndischarge ignorance with credit, in defining all those effects which\r\nthey cannot attain unto to be out of the compass of art and human\r\nendeavour.  That the very styles and forms of utterance are so many\r\ncharacters of imposture, some choosing a style of pugnacity and\r\ncontention, some of satire and reprehension, some of plausible and\r\ntempting similitudes and examples, some of great words and high\r\ndiscourse, some of short and dark sentences, some of exactness of\r\nmethod, all of positive affirmation, without disclosing the true\r\nmotives and proofs of their opinions, or free confessing their\r\nignorance or doubts, except it be now and then for a grace, and in\r\ncunning to win the more credit in the rest, and not in good faith.\r\nThat although men be free from these errors and incumbrances in the\r\nwill and affection, yet it is not a thing so easy as is conceived to\r\nconvey the conceit of one man's mind into the mind of another without\r\nloss or mistaking, specially in notions new and differing from those\r\nthat are received.  That never any knowledge was delivered in the\r\nsame order it was invented, no not in the mathematic, though it\r\nshould seem otherwise in regard that the propositions placed last do\r\nuse the propositions or grants placed first for their proof and\r\ndemonstration.  That there are forms and methods of tradition wholly\r\ndistinct and differing, according to their ends whereto they are\r\ndirected.  That there are two ends of tradition of knowledge, the one\r\nto teach and instruct for use and practice, the other to impart or\r\nintimate for re-examination and progression.  That the former of\r\nthese ends requireth a method not the same whereby it was invented\r\nand induced, but such as is most compendious and ready whereby it may\r\nbe used and applied.  That the latter of the ends, which is where a\r\nknowledge is delivered to be continued and spun on by a succession of\r\nlabours, requireth a method whereby it may be transposed to another\r\nin the same manner as it was collected, to the end it may be\r\ndiscerned both where the work is weak, and where it breaketh off.\r\nThat this latter method is not only unfit for the former end, but\r\nalso impossible for all knowledge gathered and insinuated by\r\nAnticipations, because the mind working inwardly of itself, no man\r\ncan give a just account how he came to that knowledge which he hath\r\nreceived, and that therefore this method is peculiar for knowledge\r\ngathered by interpretation.  That the discretion anciently observed,\r\nthough by the precedent of many vain persons and deceivers disgraced,\r\nof publishing part, and reserving part to a private succession, and\r\nof publishing in a manner whereby it shall not be to the capacity nor\r\ntaste of all, but shall as it were single and adopt his reader, is\r\nnot to be laid aside, both for the avoiding of abuse in the excluded,\r\nand the stregthening of affection in the admitted.  That there are\r\nother virtues of tradition, as that there be no occasion given to\r\nerror, and that it carry a vigour to root and spread against the\r\nvanity of wits and injuries of time; all which if they were ever due\r\nto any knowledge delivered, or if they were never due to any human\r\nknowledge heretofore delivered, yet are now due to the knowledge\r\npropounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the impediments which have been in the affections, the principle\r\nwhereof hath been despair or diffidence, and the strong apprehension\r\nof the difficulty, obscurity, and infiniteness which belongeth to the\r\ninvention of knowledge, and that men have not known their own\r\nstrength, and that the supposed difficulties and vastness of the work\r\nis rather in shew and muster than in state or substance where the\r\ntrue way is taken.  That this diffidence hath moved and caused some\r\nnever to enter into search, and others when they have been entered\r\neither to give over or to seek a more compendious course than can\r\nstand with the nature of true search.  That of those that have\r\nrefused and prejudged inquiry, the more sober and grave sort of wits\r\nhave depended upon authors and traditions, and the more vain and\r\ncredulous resorted to revelation and intelligence with spirits and\r\nhigher natures.  That of those that have entered into search, some\r\nhaving fallen upon some conceits which they after consider to be the\r\nsame which they have found in former authors, have suddenly taken a\r\npersuasion that a man shall but with much labour incur and light upon\r\nthe same inventions which he might with ease receive from others; and\r\nthat it is but a vanity and self-pleasing of the wit to go about\r\nagain, as one that would rather have a flower of his own gathering,\r\nthan much better gathered to his hand.  That the same humour of sloth\r\nand diffidence suggesteth that a man shall but revive some ancient\r\nopinion, which was long ago propounded, examined, and rejected.  And\r\nthat it is easy to err in conceit that a man's observation or notion\r\nis the same with a former opinion, both because new conceits must of\r\nnecessity be uttered in old words, and because upon true and\r\nerroneous grounds men may meet in consequence or conclusion, as\r\nseveral lines or circles that cut in some one point.  That the\r\ngreatest part of those that have descended into search have chosen\r\nfor the most artificial and compendious course to induce principles\r\nout of particulars, and to reduce all other propositions unto\r\nprinciples; and so instead of the nearest way, have been led to no\r\nway or a mere labyrinth.  That the two contemplative ways have some\r\nresemblance with the old parable of the two moral ways, the one\r\nbeginning with incertainty and difficulty, and ending in plainness\r\nand certainty, and the other beginning with shew of plainness and\r\ncertainty, and ending in difficulty and incertainty.  Of the great\r\nand manifest error and untrue conceit or estimation of the\r\ninfiniteness of particulars, whereas indeed all prolixity is in\r\ndiscourse and derivations; and of the infinite and most laborious\r\nexpense of wit that hath been employed upon toys and matters of no\r\nfruit or value.  That although the period of one age cannot advance\r\nmen to the furthest point of interpretation of nature, (except the\r\nwork should be undertaken with greater helps than can be expected),\r\nyet it cannot fail in much less space of time to make return of many\r\nsingular commodities towards the state and occasions of man's life.\r\nThat there is less reason of distrust in the course of interpretation\r\nnow propounded than in any knowledge formerly delivered, because this\r\ncourse doth in sort equal men's wits, and leaveth no great advantage\r\nor preeminence to the perfect and excellent motions of the spirit.\r\nThat to draw a straight line or to make a circle perfect round by aim\r\nof hand only, there must be a great difference between an unsteady\r\nand unpractised hand and a steady and practised, but to do it by rule\r\nor compass it is much alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the impediments which have been in the two extreme humours of\r\nadmiration of antiquity and love of novelty, and again of\r\nover-servile reverence or over-light scorn of the opinions of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the impediments which have been in the affection of pride,\r\nspecially of one kind, which is the disdain of dwelling and being\r\nconversant much in experiences and particulars, specially such as are\r\nvulgar in occurrency, and base and ignoble in use.  That besides\r\ncertain higher mysteries of pride, generalities seem to have a\r\ndignity and solemnity, in that they do not put men in mind of their\r\nfamiliar actions, in that they have less affinity with arts\r\nmechanical and illiberal, in that they are not so subject to be\r\ncontrolled by persons of mean observation, in that they seem to teach\r\nmen that they know not, and not to refer them to that they know.  All\r\nwhich conditions directly feeding the humour of pride, particulars do\r\nwant.  That the majesty of generalities, and the divine nature of the\r\nmind in taking them (if they be truly collected, and be indeed the\r\ndirect reflexions of things,) cannot be too much magnified.  And that\r\nit is true that interpretation is the very natural and direct\r\nintention, action, and progression of the understanding delivered\r\nfrom impediments.  And that all Anticipation is but a deflexion or\r\ndeclination by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the impediments which have been in the state of heathen religion\r\nand other superstitions and errors of religion.  And that in the true\r\nreligion there hath not nor is any impediment, except it be by\r\naccident or intermixture of humour.  That a religion which consisteth\r\nin rites and forms of adoration, and not in confessions and beliefs,\r\nis adverse to knowledge; because men having liberty to inquire and\r\ndiscourse of Theology at pleasure, it cometh to pass that all\r\ninquisition of nature endeth and limiteth itself in such metaphysical\r\nor theological discourse; whereas if men's wits be shut out of that\r\nport, it turneth them again to discover, and so to seek reason of\r\nreason more deeply.  And that such was the religion of the Heathen.\r\nThat a religion that is jealous of the variety of learning, discourse,\r\nopinions, and sects, (as misdoubting it may shake the foundations,)\r\nor that cherisheth devotion upon simplicity and ignorance, as\r\nascribing ordinary effects to the immediate working of God, is\r\nadverse to knowledge.  That such is the religion of the Turk, and\r\nsuch hath been the abuse of Christian religion at some several times,\r\nand in some several factions.  And of the singular advantage which\r\nthe Christian religion hath towards the furtherance of true knowledge,\r\nin that it excludeth and interdicteth human reason, whether by\r\ninterpretation or anticipation, from examining or discussing of the\r\nmysteries and principles of faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the impediments which have been in the nature of society and the\r\npolicies of state.  That there is no composition of estate or society,\r\nnor order or quality of persons, which have not some point of\r\ncontrariety towards true knowledge.  That monarchies incline wits to\r\nprofit and pleasure, and commonwealths to glory and vanity.  That\r\nuniversities incline wits to sophistry and affectation, cloisters to\r\nfables and unprofitable subtilty, study at large to variety; and that\r\nit is hard to say, whether mixture of contemplations with an active\r\nlife, or retiring wholly to contemplations, do disable and hinder the\r\nmind more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Back Cover.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophy.\r\nLine 1: see commentary\r\nLine 2: libri dimidium est, pagina 34\r\nLine 3: pagellarum numeri veri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting on the Back Cover of VALERIUS TERMINUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writing in the original is on the outside of the last leaf, which\r\nis in fact the cover.  The front cover, if there ever was one, is\r\nlost.  The ink with which the line containing the symbols is written\r\ncorresponds with that in the body of the manuscript; and the line\r\nitself is placed symmetrically in the middle of the page, near the\r\ntop.  The two lower lines are apparently by another hand, probably of\r\nlater date, certainly in ink of a different colour, and paler.  The\r\nword \"Philosophy\" is in Bacon's own hand, written lightly in the\r\nupper corner at the left, and is no doubt merely a docket inserted\r\nafterwards when he was sorting his papers.  What connexion there was\r\nbetween the note and the manuscript it is impossible to say.  But it\r\nis evidently a careful memorandum of something, set down by somebody\r\nwhen the manuscript was at hand; and so many of the characters\r\nresemble those adopted to represent the planets and the signs of the\r\nzodiac, that one is led to suspect in it a note of the positions of\r\nthe heavenly bodies at the time of some remarkable accident;--perhaps\r\nthe plague, of which 30,578 persons died in London, during the year\r\nending 22nd December, 1603. The period of the commencement, the\r\nduration, or the cessation of such an epidemic might naturally be so\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nNow three of the characters clearly represent respectively Mercury,\r\nAquarius, and Sagittarius.  The sign for Jupiter, as we find it in\r\nold books, is so like a 4, that the first figure of 45 may very well\r\nhave been meant for it.  The monogram at the beginning of the line\r\nbears a near resemblance to the sign of Capricorn in its most\r\ncharacteristic feature.  And the mark over the sign of Aquarius\r\nappears to be an abbreviation of that which usually represents the\r\nSun.  (The blot between 1603 and B is nothing; being only meant to\r\nrepresent a figure 6 blotted out with the finger before the ink was\r\ndry.) Suspecting therefore that the writing contained a note of the\r\npositions of Mercury and Jupiter in the year 1603, I sent a copy to a\r\nscientific friend and asked him if from such data he could determine\r\nthe month indicated.  He found upon a rough calculation (taking\r\naccount of mean motions only) that Jupiter did enter the sign of\r\nSagittarius about the 10th of August, 1603, and continued there for\r\nabout a twelvemonth; that the Sun entered Aquarius about the 12th or\r\n13th of January, 1603-4; and that Mercury was about the 16th or 17th\r\nof the same month in the 26th or 27th degree of Capricorn:\r\n--coincidences which would have been almost conclusive as to the date\r\nindicated, if Capricorn had only stood where Aquarius does, and vice\r\nversa.  But their position as they actually stood in the manuscript\r\nis a formidable, if not fatal, objection to the interpretation.\r\n\r\nAccording to another opinion with which I have been favoured, the\r\nfirst monogram is a NOTA BENE; the next group may mean DIES MERCURII\r\n(Wednesday) 26TH JANUARY, 1603; and the rest refers to something not\r\nconnected with astronomy.  But to this also there is a serious\r\nobjection.  The 26th of January, 1603-4, was a Friday, and it seems\r\nto me very improbable that any Englishman would have described the\r\npreceding January as belonging to the year 1603. Bacon himself\r\ninvariably dated according to the civil year, and the occasional use\r\nof the historical year in loose memoranda would have involved all his\r\ndates in confusion.  I should think it more probable that the writer\r\n(who may have been copying a kind of notation with which he was not\r\nfamiliar) miscopied the sign of Venus into that of Mercury; in which\r\ncase it would mean Friday, 26th January, 1603-4. But even then the\r\nexplanation would he unsatisfactory, as leaving so much unexplained.\r\nThose however who are familiar with old manuscripts relating to such\r\nsubjects may probably be able to interpret the whole.",
