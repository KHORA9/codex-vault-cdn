DATE OF THE WORK.\r\n\r\nIn my introductory remarks to the Legend of Good Women, I refer to the\r\nclose connection that is easily seen to subsist between Chaucer's\r\ntranslation of Boethius and his Troilus and Criseyde. All critics seem now\r\nto agree in placing these two works in close conjunction, and in making the\r\nprose work somewhat the earlier of the two; though it is not at all\r\nunlikely that, for a short time, both works were in hand together. It is\r\nalso clear that they were completed before the author commenced the House\r\nof Fame, the date of which is, almost certainly, about 1383-4. Dr. Koch, in\r\nhis Essay on the Chronology of Chaucer's Writings, proposes to date\r\n'Boethius' about 1377-8, and 'Troilus' about 1380-1. It is sufficient to be\r\nable to infer, as we can with tolerable certainty, that these two works\r\nbelong to the period between 1377 and 1383. And we may also feel sure that\r\nthe well-known lines to Adam, beginning--\r\n\r\n 'Adam scriveyn, if ever it thee befalle\r\n  _Boece_ or _Troilus_ to wryten newe'--\r\n\r\nwere composed at the time when the fair copy of Troilus had just been\r\nfinished, and may be dated, without fear of mistake, in 1381-3. It is not\r\nlikely that we shall be able to determine these dates within closer limits;\r\nnor is it at all necessary that we should be able to do so. A few further\r\nremarks upon this subject are given below.\r\n\r\n§ 2. BOETHIUS.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to remark upon Chaucer's translation of Boethius, or (as\r\nhe calls him) Boece, it is necessary to say a few words as to the original\r\nwork, and its author.\r\n\r\nAnicius Manlius Torquatus Severinus Boethius, the most learned philosopher\r\nof his time, was born at Rome about A. D. 480, and was put to death A. D.\r\n524. In his youth, he had the advantage of a liberal training, and enjoyed\r\nthe rare privilege of being able to read the Greek philosophers in their\r\nown tongue. In the particular treatise which here most concerns us, his\r\nGreek quotations are mostly taken from Plato, and there are a few\r\nreferences to Aristotle, Homer, and to the _Andromache_ of Euripides. His\r\nextant works shew that he was well acquainted with geometry, mechanics,\r\nastronomy, and music, as well as with logic and theology; and it is an\r\ninteresting fact that an illustration of the way in which waves of sound\r\nare propagated through the air, introduced by Chaucer into his House of\r\nFame, ll. 788-822, is almost certainly derived from the treatise of\r\nBoethius _De Musica_, as pointed out in the note upon that passage. At any\r\nrate, there is an unequivocal reference to 'the felinge' of Boece 'in\r\nmusik' in the Nonnes Preestes Tale, B 4484.\r\n\r\n§ 3. The most important part of his political life was passed in the\r\nservice of the celebrated Theodoric the Goth, who, after the defeat and\r\ndeath of Odoacer, A. D. 493, had made himself undisputed master of Italy,\r\nand had fixed the seat of his government in Ravenna. The usual account,\r\nthat Boethius was twice married, is now discredited, there being no clear\r\nevidence with respect to Elpis, the name assigned to his supposed first\r\nwife; but it is certain that he married Rusticiana, the daughter of the\r\npatrician Symmachus, a man of great influence and probity, and much\r\nrespected, who had been consul under Odoacer in 485. Boethius had the\r\nsingular felicity of seeing his two sons, Boethius and Symmachus, raised to\r\nthe consular dignity on the same day, in 522. After many years spent in\r\nindefatigable study and great public usefulness, he fell under the\r\nsuspicion of Theodoric; and, notwithstanding an indignant denial of his\r\nsupposed crimes, was hurried away to Pavia, where he was imprisoned in a\r\ntower, and denied the means of justifying his conduct. The rest must be\r\ntold in the eloquent words of Gibbon[1].\r\n\r\n'While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the sentence\r\nor the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of Pavia the \"Consolation\r\nof Philosophy\"; a golden volume, not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or\r\nTully, but which claims incomparable merit from the barbarism of the times\r\nand the situation of the author. The celestial guide[2], whom he had so\r\nlong invoked at Rome and at Athens, now condescended to illumine his\r\ndungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his wounds her salutary\r\nbalm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity and his recent\r\ndistress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy of fortune[3].\r\nReason had informed him of the precarious condition of her gifts;\r\nexperience had satisfied him of their real value[4]; he had enjoyed them\r\nwithout guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly disdain the\r\nimpotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness, since they had\r\nleft him virtue[5]. From the earth, Boethius ascended to heaven in search\r\nof the SUPREME GOOD[6], explored the metaphysical labyrinth of chance and\r\ndestiny[7], of prescience and freewill, of time and eternity, and\r\ngenerously attempted to reconcile the perfect attributes of the Deity with\r\nthe apparent disorders of his moral and physical government[8]. Such topics\r\nof consolation, so obvious, so vague, or so abstruse, are ineffectual to\r\nsubdue the feelings of human nature. Yet the sense of misfortune may be\r\ndiverted by the labour of thought; and the sage who could artfully combine,\r\nin the same work, the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence,\r\nmust already have possessed the intrepid calmness which he affected to\r\nseek. Suspense, the worst of evils, was at length determined by the\r\nministers of death, who executed, and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate\r\nof Theodoric. A strong cord was fastened round the head of Boethius, and\r\nforcibly tightened till his eyes almost started from their sockets; and\r\nsome mercy may be discovered in the milder torture of beating him with\r\nclubs till he expired. But his genius survived to diffuse a ray of\r\nknowledge over the darkest ages of the Latin world; the writings of the\r\nphilosopher were translated by the most glorious of the English Kings, and\r\nthe third emperor of the name of Otho removed to a more honourable tomb the\r\nbones of a catholic saint, who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired\r\nthe honours of martyrdom and the fame of miracles. In the last hours of\r\nBoethius, he derived some comfort from the safety of his two sons, of his\r\nwife, and of his father-in-law, the venerable Symmachus. But the grief of\r\nSymmachus was indiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful; he had presumed to\r\nlament, he might dare to revenge, the death of an injured friend. He was\r\ndragged in chains from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of\r\nTheodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and aged\r\nsenator.'\r\n\r\nThis deed of injustice brought small profit to its perpetrator; for we read\r\nthat Theodoric's own death took place shortly afterwards; and that, on his\r\ndeath-bed, 'he expressed in broken murmurs to his physician Elpidius, his\r\ndeep repentance for the murders of Boethius and Symmachus.'\r\n\r\n§ 4. For further details, I beg leave to refer the reader to the essay on\r\n'Boethius' by H. F. Stewart, published by W. Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh\r\nand London, in 1891. We are chiefly concerned here with the 'Consolation of\r\nPhilosophy,' a work which enjoyed great popularity in the middle ages, and\r\nfirst influenced Chaucer indirectly, through the use of it made by Jean de\r\nMeun in the poem entitled Le Roman de la Rose, as well as directly, at a\r\nlater period, through his own translation of it. Indeed, I have little\r\ndoubt that Chaucer's attention was drawn to it when, somewhat early in\r\nlife, he first perused with diligence that remarkable poem; and that it was\r\nfrom the following passage that he probably drew the inference that it\r\nmight be well for him to translate the whole work:--\r\n\r\n 'Ce puet l'en bien des clers enquerre\r\n  Qui _Boëce de Confort_ lisent,\r\n  Et les sentences qui là gisent,\r\n  _Dont grans biens as gens laiz feroit\r\n  Qui bien le lor translateroit_' (ll. 5052-6).\r\n\r\nI.e. in modern English:--'This can be easily ascertained from the learned\r\nmen who read Boece on the Consolation of Philosophy, and the opinions which\r\nare found therein; as to which, any one _who would well translate it for\r\nthem_ would confer much benefit on the unlearned folk':--a pretty strong\r\nhint[9]!\r\n\r\n§ 5. The chief events in the life of Boethius which are referred to in the\r\npresent treatise are duly pointed out in the notes; and it may be well to\r\nbear in mind that, as to some of these, nothing further is known beyond\r\nwhat the author himself tells us. Most of the personal references occur in\r\nBook i. Prose 4, Book ii. Prose 3, and in Book iii. Prose 4. In the first\r\nof these passages, Boethius recalls the manner in which he withstood one\r\nConigastus, because he oppressed the poor (l. 40); and how he defeated the\r\niniquities of Triguilla, 'provost' (_præpositus_) of the royal household\r\n(l. 43). He takes credit for defending the people of Campania against a\r\nparticularly obnoxious fiscal measure instituted by Theodoric, which was\r\ncalled 'coemption' (_coemptio_); (l. 59.) This Mr. Stewart describes as 'a\r\nfiscal measure which allowed the state to buy provisions for the army at\r\nsomething under market-price--which threatened to ruin the province.' He\r\ntells us that he rescued Decius Paulinus, who had been consul in 498, from\r\nthe rapacity of the officers of the royal palace (l. 68); and that, in\r\norder to save Decius Albinus, who had been consul in 493, from wrongful\r\npunishment, he ran the risk of incurring the hate of the informer Cyprian\r\n(l. 75). In these ways, he had rendered himself odious to the court-party,\r\nwhom he had declined to bribe (l. 79). His accusers were Basilius, who had\r\nbeen expelled from the king's service, and was impelled to accuse him by\r\npressure of debt (l. 81); and Opilio and Gaudentius, who had been sentenced\r\nto exile by royal decree for their numberless frauds and crimes, but had\r\nescaped the sentence by taking sanctuary. 'And when,' as he tells us, 'the\r\nking discovered this evasion, he gave orders that, unless they quitted\r\nRavenna by a given day, they should be branded on the forehead with a hot\r\niron and driven out of the city. Nevertheless on that very day the\r\ninformation laid against me by these men was admitted' (ll. 89-94). He next\r\nalludes to some forged letters (l. 123), by means of which he had been\r\naccused of 'hoping for the freedom of Rome,' (which was of course\r\ninterpreted to mean that he wished to deliver Rome from the tyranny of\r\nTheodoric). He then boldly declares that if he had had the opportunity of\r\nconfronting his accusers, he would have answered in the words of Canius,\r\nwhen accused by Caligula of having been privy to a conspiracy against\r\nhim--'If I had known it, thou shouldst never have known it' (ll. 126-135).\r\nThis, by the way, was rather an imprudent expression, and probably told\r\nagainst him when his case was considered by Theodoric.\r\n\r\nHe further refers to an incident that took place at Verona (l. 153), when\r\nthe king, eager for a general slaughter of his enemies, endeavoured to\r\nextend to the whole body of the senate the charge of treason, of which\r\nAlbinus had been accused; on which occasion, at great personal risk,\r\nBoethius had defended the senate against so sweeping an accusation.\r\n\r\nIn Book ii. Prose 3, he refers to his former state of happiness and good\r\nfortune (l. 26), when he was blessed with rich and influential\r\nparents-in-law, with a beloved wife, and with two noble sons; in particular\r\n(l. 35), he speaks with justifiable pride of the day when his sons were\r\nboth elected consuls together, and when, sitting in the Circus between\r\nthem, he won general praise for his wit and eloquence.\r\n\r\nIn Book iii. Prose 4, he declaims against Decoratus, with whom he refused\r\nto be associated in office, on account of his infamous character.\r\n\r\n§ 6. The chief source of further information about these circumstances is a\r\ncollection of letters (Variæ Epistolæ) by Cassiodorus, a statesman who\r\nenjoyed the full confidence of Theodoric, and collected various\r\nstate-papers under his direction. These tell us, in some measure, what can\r\nbe said on the other side. Here Cyprian and his brother Opilio are spoken\r\nof with respect and honour; and the only Decoratus whose name appears is\r\nspoken of as a young man of great promise, who had won the king's sincere\r\nesteem. But when all has been said, the reader will most likely be inclined\r\nto think that, in cases of conflicting evidence, he would rather take the\r\nword of the noble Boethius than that of any of his opponents.\r\n\r\n§ 7. The treatise 'De Consolatione Philosophiæ' is written in the form of a\r\ndiscourse between himself and the personification of Philosophy, who\r\nappears to him in his prison, and endeavours to soothe and console him in\r\nhis time of trial. It is divided (as in this volume) into five Books; and\r\neach Book is subdivided into chapters, entitled Metres and Proses, because,\r\nin the original, the alternate chapters are written in a metrical form, the\r\nmetres employed being of various kinds. Thus Metre 1 of Book I is written\r\nin alternate hexameters and pentameters; while Metre 7 consists of very\r\nshort lines, each consisting of a single dactyl and spondee. The Proses\r\ncontain the main arguments; the Metres serve for embellishment and\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nIn some MSS. of Chaucer's translation, a few words of the original are\r\nquoted at the beginning of each Prose and Metre, and are duly printed in\r\nthis edition, in a corrected form.\r\n\r\n§ 8. A very brief sketch of the general contents of the volume may be of\r\nsome service.\r\n\r\n  BOOK I. Boethius deplores his misfortunes (met. 1). Philosophy appears to\r\n  him in a female form (pr. 2), and condoles with him in song (met. 2);\r\n  after which she addresses him, telling him that she is willing to share\r\n  his misfortunes (pr. 3). Boethius pours out his complaints, and\r\n  vindicates his past conduct (pr. 4). Philosophy reminds him that he seeks\r\n  a heavenly country (pr. 5). The world is not governed by chance (pr. 6).\r\n  The book concludes with a lay of hope (met. 7).\r\n\r\n  BOOK II. Philosophy enlarges on the wiles of Fortune (pr. 1), and\r\n  addresses him in Fortune's name, asserting that her mutability is natural\r\n  and to be expected (pr. 2). Adversity is transient (pr. 3), and Boethius\r\n  has still much to be thankful for (pr. 4). Riches only bring anxieties,\r\n  and cannot confer happiness (pr. 5); they were unknown in the Golden Age\r\n  (met. 5). Neither does happiness consist in honours and power (pr. 6).\r\n  The power of Nero only taught him cruelty (met. 6). Fame is but vanity\r\n  (pr. 7), and is ended by death (met. 7). Adversity is beneficial (pr. 8).\r\n  All things are bound together by the chain of Love (met. 8).\r\n\r\n  BOOK III. Boethius begins to receive comfort (pr. 1). Philosophy\r\n  discourses on the search for the Supreme Good (_summum bonum_; pr. 2).\r\n  The laws of nature are immutable (met. 2). All men are engaged in the\r\n  pursuit of happiness (pr. 3). Dignities properly appertain to virtue (pr.\r\n  4). Power cannot drive away care (pr. 5). Glory is deceptive, and the\r\n  only true nobility is that of character (pr. 6). Happiness does not\r\n  consist in corporeal pleasures (pr. 7); nor in bodily strength or beauty\r\n  (pr. 8). Worldly bliss is insufficient and false; and in seeking true\r\n  felicity, we must invoke God's aid (pr. 9). Boethius sings a hymn to the\r\n  Creator (met. 9); and acknowledges that God alone is the Supreme Good (p.\r\n  10). The unity of soul and body is necessary to existence, and the love\r\n  of life is instinctive (pr. 11). Error is dispersed by the light of Truth\r\n  (met. 11). God governs the world, and is all-sufficient, whilst evil has\r\n  no true existence (pr. 12). The book ends with the story of Orpheus (met.\r\n  12).\r\n\r\n  BOOK IV. This book opens with a discussion of the existence of evil, and\r\n  the system of rewards and punishments (pr. 1). Boethius describes the\r\n  flight of Imagination through the planetary spheres till it reaches\r\n  heaven itself (met. 1). The good are strong, but the wicked are\r\n  powerless, having no real existence (pr. 2). Tyrants are chastised by\r\n  their own passions (met. 2). Virtue secures reward; but the wicked lose\r\n  even their human nature, and become as mere beasts (pr. 3). Consider the\r\n  enchantments of Circe, though these merely affected the outward form\r\n  (met. 4). The wicked are thrice wretched; they _will_ to do evil, they\r\n  _can_ do evil, and they actually _do_ it. Virtue is its own reward; so\r\n  that the wicked should excite our pity (pr. 4). Here follows a poem on\r\n  the folly of war (met. 4). Boethius inquires why the good suffer (pr. 5).\r\n  Philosophy reminds him that the motions of the stars are inexplicable to\r\n  one who does not understand astronomy (met. 5). She explains the\r\n  difference between Providence and Destiny (pr. 6). In all nature we see\r\n  concord, due to controlling Love (met. 6). All fortune is good; for\r\n  punishment is beneficial (pr. 7). The labours of Hercules afford us an\r\n  example of endurance (met. 7).\r\n\r\n  BOOK V. Boethius asks questions concerning Chance (pr. 1). An example\r\n  from the courses of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates (met. 1). Boethius\r\n  asks questions concerning Free-will (pr. 2). God, who sees all things, is\r\n  the true Sun (met. 2). Boethius is puzzled by the consideration of God's\r\n  Predestination and man's Free-will (pr. 3). Men are too eager to inquire\r\n  into the unknown (met. 3). Philosophy replies to Boethius on the subjects\r\n  of Predestination, Necessity, and the nature of true Knowledge (pr. 4);\r\n  on the impressions received by the mind (met. 4); and on the powers of\r\n  Sense and Imagination (pr. 5). Beasts look downward to the earth, but man\r\n  is upright, and looks up to heaven (met. 5). This world is not eternal,\r\n  but only God is such; whose prescience is not subject to necessity, nor\r\n  altered by human intentions. He upholds the good, and condemns the\r\n  wicked; therefore be constant in eschewing vice, and devote all thy\r\n  powers to the love of virtue (pr. 6).\r\n\r\n§ 9. It is unnecessary to enlarge here upon the importance of this\r\ntreatise, and its influence upon medieval literature. Mr. Stewart, in the\r\nwork already referred to, has an excellent chapter 'On Some Ancient\r\nTranslations' of it. The number of translations that still exist, in\r\nvarious languages, sufficiently testify to its extraordinary popularity in\r\nthe middle ages. Copies of it are found, for example, in Old High German by\r\nNotker, and in later German by Peter of Kastl; in Anglo-French by Simun de\r\nFraisne; in continental French by Jean de Meun[10], Pierre de Paris, Jehan\r\nde Cis, Frere Renaut de Louhans, and by two anonymous authors; in Italian,\r\nby Alberto della Piagentina and several others; in Greek, by Maximus\r\nPlanudes; and in Spanish, by Fra Antonio Ginebreda; besides various\r\nversions in later times. But the most interesting, to us, are those in\r\nEnglish, which are somewhat numerous, and are worthy of some special\r\nnotice. I shall here dismiss, as improbable and unnecessary, a suggestion\r\nsometimes made, that Chaucer may have consulted some French version in the\r\nhope of obtaining assistance from it; there is no sure trace of anything of\r\nthe kind, and the internal evidence is, in my opinion, decisively against\r\nit.\r\n\r\n§ 10. The earliest English translation is that by king Ælfred, which is\r\nparticularly interesting from the fact that the royal author frequently\r\ndeviates from his original, and introduces various notes, explanations, and\r\nallusions of his own. The opening chapter, for example, is really a\r\npreface, giving a brief account of Theodoric and of the circumstances which\r\nled to the imprisonment of Boethius. This work exists only in two MSS.,\r\nneither being of early date, viz. MS. Cotton, Otho A VI, and MS. Bodley NE.\r\nC. 3. 11. It has been thrice edited; by Rawlinson, in 1698; by J. S.\r\nCardale, in 1829; and by S. Fox, in 1864. The last of these includes a\r\nmodern English translation, and forms one of the volumes of Bohn's\r\nAntiquarian Library; so that it is a cheap and accessible work. Moreover,\r\nit contains an alliterative verse translation of most of the _Metres_\r\ncontained in Boethius (excluding the _Proses_), which is also attributed to\r\nÆlfred in a brief metrical preface; but whether this ascription is to be\r\nrelied upon, or not, is a difficult question, which has hardly as yet been\r\ndecided. A summary of the arguments, for and against Ælfred's authorship,\r\nwill be found in Wülker's _Grundriss zur Geschichte der angelsächsischen\r\nLitteratur_, pp. 421-435.\r\n\r\n§ 11. I may here mention that there is a manuscript copy of this work by\r\nBoethius, in the original Latin, in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, No.\r\n214, which contains a considerable number of Anglo-Saxon glosses. A\r\ndescription of this MS., by Prof. J. W. Bright and myself, is printed in\r\nthe American Journal of Philology, vol. v, no. 4.\r\n\r\n§ 12. The next English translation, in point of date, is Chaucer's;\r\nconcerning which I have more to say below.\r\n\r\n§ 13. In the year 1410, we meet with a _verse_ translation of the whole\r\ntreatise, ascribed by Warton (Hist. E. Poetry, § 20, ed. 1871, iii. 39) to\r\nJohn Walton, Capellanus, or John the Chaplain, a canon of Oseney. 'In the\r\nBritish Museum,' says Warton, 'there is a correct MS. on parchment[11] of\r\nWalton's translation of Boethius; and the margin is filled throughout with\r\nthe Latin text, written by Chaundler above mentioned [i. e. Thomas\r\nChaundler, among other preferments dean of the king's chapel and of\r\nHereford Cathedral, chancellor of Wells, and successively warden of\r\nWykeham's two colleges at Winchester and Oxford.] There is another less\r\nelegant MS. in the same collection[12]. But at the end is this\r\nnote:--'Explicit liber Boecij de Consolatione Philosophie de Latino in\r\nAnglicum translatus A.D. 1410, per Capellanum Ioannem. This is the\r\nbeginning of the prologue:--\"In suffisaunce of cunnyng and witte[13].\" And\r\nof the translation:--\"Alas, I wrecch, that whilom was in welth.\" I have\r\nseen a third copy in the library of Lincoln cathedral[14], and a fourth in\r\nBaliol college[15]. This is the translation of Boethius printed in the\r\nmonastery of Tavistock in 1525[16], and in octave stanzas. This translation\r\nwas made at the request of Elizabeth Berkeley.'\r\n\r\nTodd, in his Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer, p. xxxi, mentions another\r\nMS. 'in the possession of Mr. G. Nicol, his Majesty's bookseller,' in which\r\nthe above translation is differently attributed in the colophon, which ends\r\nthus: 'translatus anno d_omi_ni millesimo ccccx^o. per Capellanum Iohannem\r\nTebaud, alius Watyrbeche.' This can hardly be correct[17].\r\n\r\nI may here note that this verse translation has _two_ separate Prologues.\r\nOne Prologue gives a short account of Boethius and his times, and is extant\r\nin MS. Gg. iv. 18 in the Cambridge University Library. An extract from the\r\nother is quoted below. MS. E Museo 53, in the Bodleian Library, contains\r\nboth of them.\r\n\r\n§ 14. As to the work itself, Metre 1 of Book i. and Metre 5 of the same are\r\nprinted entire in Wülker's Altenglisches Lesebuch, ii. 56-9. In one of the\r\nmetrical prologues to the whole work the following passage occurs, which I\r\ncopy from MS. Royal 18 A xiii:--\r\n\r\n 'I have herd spek and sumwhat haue y-seyne,\r\n  Of diuerse men[18], that wounder subtyllye,\r\n  In metir sum, and sum in prosë pleyne,\r\n  This book translated haue[19] suffishantlye\r\n  In-to[20] Englissh tongë, word for word, wel nye[21];\r\n  Bot I most vse the wittes that I haue;\r\n  Thogh I may noght do so, yit noght-for-thye,\r\n  With helpe of god, the sentence schall I saue.\r\n\r\n  To Chaucer, that is floure of rethoryk\r\n  In Englisshe tong, and excellent poete,\r\n  This wot I wel, no-thing may I do lyk,\r\n  Thogh so that I of makynge entyrmete:\r\n  And Gower, that so craftily doth trete,\r\n  As in his book, of moralitee,\r\n  Thogh I to theym in makyng am vnmete,\r\n  [Gh]it most I schewe it forth, that is in me.'\r\n\r\nThis is an early tribute to the excellence of Chaucer and Gower as poets.\r\n\r\n§ 15. When we examine Walton's translation a little more closely, it soon\r\nbecomes apparent that he has largely availed himself of Chaucer's prose\r\ntranslation, which he evidently kept before him as a model of language. For\r\nexample, in Bk. ii. met. 5, l. 16, Chaucer has the expression:--'tho weren\r\nthe cruel clariouns ful hust and ful stille.' This reappears in one of\r\nWalton's lines in the form:--'Tho was ful huscht the cruel clarioun.' This\r\nis poetry made easy, no doubt.\r\n\r\nIn order to exhibit this a little more fully, I here transcribe the whole\r\nof Walton's translation of this metre, which may be compared with Chaucer's\r\nrendering at pp. 40, 41 below. I print in italics all the words which are\r\ncommon to the two versions, so as to shew this curious result, viz. that\r\nWalton was here more indebted to Chaucer, than Chaucer, when writing his\r\npoem of 'The Former Age,' was to himself. The MS. followed is the Royal MS.\r\nmentioned above (p. xvi).\r\n\r\n  BOETHIUS: BOOK II: METER V.\r\n\r\n  A VERSE TRANSLATION BY JOHN WALTON.\r\n\r\n  Full wonder _blisseful was_ that rather _age_,\r\n  When mortal men couthe _holde hem_-selven[22]  _payed_\r\n  To fede hem-selve[23] with-oute suche _outerage_,\r\n  _With mete that trewe feeldes_[24] have arrayed;\r\n  _With acorne[s] thaire hunger_ was alayed,\r\n  And so thei couthe sese thaire talent;\r\n  Thei had[den] yit no queynt[e] craft assayed,\r\n  As _clarry_ for to _make_ ne _pyment_[25].\r\n\r\n  _To de[y]en purpure couthe thei noght_ be-thynke,\r\n  _The white flees, with venym Tyryen_;\r\n  _The rennyng_ ryver yaf hem lusty drynke,\r\n  And _holsom sleep the[y]_ took _vpon the_ grene.\r\n  _The pynes_, that so full of braunches been,\r\n  That was thaire hous, to kepe[n] _vnder schade_.\r\n  _The see[26] to kerve_ no _schippes_ were there seen;\r\n  Ther was no man that _marchaundise_ made.\r\n\r\n  They liked not to sailen vp and doun,\r\n  But kepe hem-selven[27] where thei weren bred;\r\n  _Tho was ful huscht the cruel clarioun_,\r\n  For _eger hate_ ther was _no blood I-sched_,\r\n  Ne therwith was non _armour_ yet be-bled;\r\n  _For_ in that tyme who durst have be so _wood_\r\n  Suche bitter _woundes_ that he nold have dred,\r\n  With-outen réward, for to lese his _blood_.\r\n\r\n  _I wold oure tyme_ myght _turne_ certanly,\r\n  And wise[28] _maneres_ alwey with vs dwelle;\r\n  _But love of hauyng brenneth_ feruently,\r\n  _More_ fersere _than the_ verray _fuyre_ of helle.\r\n  _Allas!_ who _was_ that man _that_ wold him melle\r\n  With[29] _gold and_ gemmes that were _kevered_ thus[30],\r\n  _That first_ began to myne; I can not telle,\r\n  But that he fond _a perel[31] precious_.\r\n\r\n§ 16. MS. Auct. F. 3. 5, in the Bodleian Library, contains a _prose_\r\ntranslation, different from Chaucer's. After this, the next translation\r\nseems to be one by George Colvile; the title is thus given by Lowndes:\r\n'Boetius de Consolatione Philosophiæ, translated by George Coluile, alias\r\nColdewel. London: by John Cawoode; 1556. 4to.' This work was dedicated to\r\nQueen Mary, and reprinted in 1561; and again, without date.\r\n\r\nThere is an unprinted translation, in hexameters and other metres, in the\r\nBritish Museum (MS. Addit. 11401), by Bracegirdle, temp. Elizabeth. See\r\nWarton, ed. Hazlitt, iii. 39, note 6.\r\n\r\nLowndes next mentions a translation by J. T., printed at London in 1609,\r\n12mo.\r\n\r\nA translation 'Anglo-Latine expressus per S. E. M.' was printed at London\r\nin quarto, in 1654, according to Hazlitt's Hand-book to Popular Literature.\r\n\r\nNext, a translation into English verse by H. Conningesbye, in 1664, 12mo.\r\n\r\nThe next is thus described: 'Of the Consolation of Philosophy, made English\r\nand illustrated with Notes by the Right Hon. Richard (Graham) Lord Viscount\r\nPreston. London; 1695, 8vo. Second edition, corrected; London; 1712, 8vo.'\r\n\r\nA translation by W. Causton was printed in London in 1730; 8vo.\r\n\r\nA translation by the Rev. Philip Ridpath, printed in London in 1785, 8vo.,\r\nis described by Lowndes as 'an excellent translation with very useful\r\nnotes, and a life of Boethius, drawn up with great accuracy and fidelity.'\r\n\r\nA translation by R. Duncan was printed at Edinburgh in 1789, 8vo.; and an\r\nanonymous translation, described by Lowndes as 'a pitiful performance,' was\r\nprinted in London in 1792, 8vo.\r\n\r\nIn a list of works which the Early English Text Society proposes shortly to\r\nprint, we are told that 'Miss Pemberton has sent to press her edition of\r\nthe fragments of Queen Elizabeth's Englishings (in the Record Office) from\r\nBoethius, Plutarch, &c.'\r\n\r\n§ 17. I now return to the consideration of Chaucer's translation, as\r\nprinted in the present volume.\r\n\r\nI do not think the question as to the probable date of its composition need\r\ndetain us long. It is so obviously connected with 'Troilus' and the 'House\r\nof Fame,' which it probably did not long precede, that we can hardly be\r\nwrong in dating it, as said above, about 1377-1380; or, in round numbers,\r\nabout 1380 or a little earlier. I quite agree with Mr. Stewart (Essay, p.\r\n226), that, 'it is surely most reasonable to connect its composition with\r\nthose poems which contain the greatest number of recollections and\r\nimitations of his original;' and I see no reason for ascribing it, with\r\nProfessor Morley (English Writers, v. 144), to Chaucer's youth. Even Mr.\r\nStewart is so incautious as to suggest that Chaucer's 'acquaintance with\r\nthe works of the Roman philosopher ... would seem to date from about the\r\nyear 1369, when he wrote the Deth of Blaunche.' When we ask for some\r\ntangible evidence of this statement, we are simply referred to the\r\nfollowing passages in that poem, viz. the mention of 'Tityus (588); of\r\nFortune the debonaire (623); Fortune the monster (627); Fortune's\r\ncapriciousness and her rolling wheel (634, 642); Tantalus (708); the mind\r\ncompared to a clean parchment (778); and Alcibiades (1055-6);' see Essay,\r\np. 267. In every one of these instances, I believe the inference to be\r\nfallacious, and that Chaucer got all these illustrations, _at second hand_,\r\nfrom Le Roman de la Rose. As a matter of fact, they are all to be found\r\nthere; and I find, on reference, that I have, in most instances, already\r\ngiven the parallel passages in my notes. However, to make the matter\r\nclearer, I repeat them here.\r\n\r\nBook Duch. 588. Cf. Comment li juisier _Ticius_\r\n                    S'efforcent ostoir de mangier;\r\n                         Rom. Rose, 19506.\r\n                    Si cum tu fez, las _Sisifus_, &c.;\r\n                         R. R. 19499.\r\n\r\nBook Duch. 623. The dispitouse debonaire,\r\n                That scorneth many a creature.\r\n\r\nI cannot give the exact reference, because Jean de Meun's description of\r\nthe various moods of Fortune extends to a portentous length. Chaucer\r\nreproduces the general impression which a perusal of the poem leaves on the\r\nmind. However, take ll. 4860-62 of Le Roman:--\r\n\r\n  Que miex vaut asses et profite\r\n  Fortune _perverse et contraire_\r\n  Que la mole et _la debonnaire_.\r\n\r\nSurely 'debonaire' in Chaucer is rather French than Latin. And see\r\n_debonaire_ in the E. version of the Romaunt, l. 5412.\r\n\r\nBook Duch. 627. She is the monstres heed y-wryen,\r\n                As _filth over y-strawed with floures_.\r\n\r\n                Si di, par ma parole ovrir,\r\n                Qui vodroit _un femier covrir_\r\n                De dras de soie ou _de floretes_; R. R. 8995.\r\n\r\nAs the second of the above lines from the Book of the Duchesse is obviously\r\ntaken from _Le Roman_, it is probable that the first is also; but it is a\r\nhard task to discover the particular word _monstre_ in this vast poem.\r\nHowever, I find it, in l. 4917, with reference to Fortune; and her _wheel_\r\nis not far off, six lines above.\r\n\r\nB. D. 634, 642. Fortune's capriciousness is treated of by Jean de Meun at\r\nintolerable length, ll. 4863-8492; and elsewhere. As to her wheel, it is\r\ncontinually rolling through his verses; see ll. 4911, 5366, 5870, 5925,\r\n6172, 6434, 6648, 6880, &c.\r\n\r\nB. D. 708. Cf. Et de fain avec _Tentalus_; R. R. 19482.\r\n\r\nB. D. 778. Not from Le Roman, nor from Boethius, but from Machault's\r\n_Remède de Fortune_, as pointed out by M. Sandras long ago; see my note.\r\n\r\nB. D. 1055-6. Cf. Car le cors Alcipiades\r\n                  Qui de biauté avoit adés ...\r\n                  _Ainsinc le raconte Boece_; R. R. 8981.\r\n\r\nSee my note on the line; and note the spelling of _Alcipiades_ with a _p_,\r\nas in the English MSS.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that all these passages (except l. 778) are really taken from\r\nLe Roman, not to mention many more, already pointed out by Dr. Köppel\r\n(_Anglia_, xiv. 238). And, this being so, we may safely conclude that they\r\nwere _not_ taken from Boethius directly. Hence we may further infer that,\r\nin all probability, Chaucer, in 1369, was not very familiar with Boethius\r\nin the Latin original. And this accounts at once for the fact that he\r\nseldom quotes Boethius at first hand, perhaps not at all, in any of his\r\nearlier poems, such as the Complaint unto Pite, the Complaint of Mars, or\r\nAnelida and Arcite, or the Lyf of St. Cecilie. I see no reason for\r\nsupposing that he had closely studied Boethius before (let us say) 1375;\r\nthough it is extremely probable, as was said above, that Jean de Meun\r\ninspired him with the idea of reading it, to see whether it was really\r\nworth translating, as the French poet said it was.\r\n\r\n§ 18. When we come to consider the style and manner in which Chaucer has\r\nexecuted his self-imposed task, we must first of all make some allowance\r\nfor the difference between the scholarship of his age and of our own. One\r\ngreat difference is obvious, though constantly lost sight of, viz. that the\r\nteaching in those days was almost entirely oral, and that the student had\r\nto depend upon his memory to an extent which would now be regarded by many\r\nas extremely inconvenient. Suppose that, in reading Boethius, Chaucer comes\r\nacross the phrase 'ueluti quidam clauus atque gubernaculum' (Bk. iii. pr.\r\n12, note to l. 55), and does not remember the sense of _clauus_; what is to\r\nbe done? It is quite certain, though this again is frequently lost sight\r\nof, that he had no access to a convenient and well-arranged Latin\r\nDictionary, but only to such imperfect glossaries as were then in use.\r\nAlmost the only resource, unless he had at hand a friend more learned than\r\nhimself, was to guess. He guesses accordingly; and, taking _clauus_ to mean\r\nmuch the same thing as _clauis_, puts down in his translation: 'and he is\r\nas a _keye_ and a stere.' Some mistakes of this character were almost\r\ninevitable; and it must not greatly surprise us to be told, that the\r\n'inaccuracy and infelicity' of Chaucer's translation 'is not that of an\r\ninexperienced Latin scholar, but rather of one who was no Latin scholar at\r\nall,' as Mr. Stewart says in his Essay, p. 226. It is useful to bear this\r\nin mind, because a similar lack of accuracy is characteristic of Chaucer's\r\nother works also; and we must not always infer that emendation is\r\nnecessary, when we find in his text some curious error.\r\n\r\n§ 19. The next passage in Mr. Stewart's Essay so well expresses the state\r\nof the case, that I do not hesitate to quote it at length. 'Given (he says)\r\na man who is sufficiently conversant with a language to read it fluently\r\nwithout paying too much heed to the precise value of participle and\r\npreposition, who has the wit and the sagacity to grasp the meaning of his\r\nauthor, but not the intimate knowledge of his style and manner necessary to\r\na right appreciation of either, and--especially if he set himself to write\r\nin an uncongenial and unfamiliar form--he will assuredly produce just such\r\na result as Chaucer has done.\r\n\r\n'We must now glance (he adds) at the literary style of the translation. As\r\nTen Brink has observed, we can here see as clearly as in any work of the\r\nmiddle ages what a high cultivation is requisite for the production of a\r\ngood prose. Verse, and not prose, is the natural vehicle for the expression\r\nof every language in its infancy, and it is certainly not in prose that\r\nChaucer's genius shews to best advantage. The restrictions of metre were\r\nindeed to him as silken fetters, while the freedom of prose only served to\r\nembarrass him; just as a bird that has been born and bred in captivity,\r\nwhose traditions are all domestic, finds itself at a sad loss when it\r\nescapes from its cage and has to fall back on its own resources for\r\nsustenance. In reading \"Boece,\" we have often as it were to pause and look\r\non while Chaucer has a desperate wrestle with a tough sentence; but though\r\nnow he may appear to be down, with a victorious knee upon him, next moment\r\nhe is on his feet again, disclaiming defeat in a gloss which makes us doubt\r\nwhether his adversary had so much the best of it after all. But such\r\nstrenuous endeavour, even when it is crowned with success, is strange in a\r\nwriter one of whose chief charms is the delightful ease, the complete\r\nabsence of effort, with which he says his best things. It is only necessary\r\nto compare the passages in Boethius in the prose version with the same when\r\nthey reappear in the poems, to realise how much better they look in their\r\nverse dress. Let the reader take Troilus' soliloquy on Freewill and\r\nPredestination (Bk. iv. ll. 958-1078), and read it side by side with the\r\ncorresponding passage in \"Boece\" (Bk. v. proses 2 and 3), and he cannot\r\nfail to feel the superiority of the former to the latter. With what\r\nclearness and precision does the argument unfold itself, how close is the\r\nreasoning, how vigorous and yet graceful is the language! It is to be\r\nregretted that Chaucer did not do for all the Metra of the \"Consolation\"\r\nwhat he did for the fifth of the second book. A solitary gem like \"The\r\nFormer Age\" makes us long for a whole set[32]. Sometimes, whether\r\nunconsciously or of set purpose, it is difficult to decide, his prose slips\r\ninto verse:--\r\n\r\n  It lyketh me to shewe, by subtil song,\r\n  With slakke and délitáble soun of strenges (Bk. iii. met. 2. 1).\r\n\r\n  Whan Fortune, with a proud right hand (Bk. ii. met. 1. 1)[33].'\r\n\r\nThe reader should also consult Ten Brink's History of English Literature,\r\nBook iv. sect. 7. I here give a useful extract.\r\n\r\n'This version is complete, and faithful in all essential points. Chaucer\r\nhad no other purpose than to disclose, if possible wholly, the meaning of\r\nthis famous work to his contemporaries; and notwithstanding many errors in\r\nsingle points, he has fairly well succeeded in reproducing the sense of the\r\noriginal. He often employs for this purpose periphrastic turns, and for the\r\nexplanation of difficult passages, poetical figures, mythological and\r\nhistorical allusions; and he even incorporates a number of notes in his\r\ntext. His version thus becomes somewhat diffuse, and, in the undeveloped\r\nstate of prose composition so characteristic of that age, often quite\r\nunwieldy. But there is no lack of warmth, and even of a certain\r\ncolouring....\r\n\r\n'The language of the translation shews many a peculiarity; viz. numerous\r\nLatinisms, and even Roman idioms in synthesis, inflexion, or syntax, which\r\nare either wholly absent or at least found very rarely in Chaucer's poems.\r\nThe labour of this translation proved a school for the poet, from which his\r\npowers of speech came forth not only more elevated but more self-reliant;\r\nand above all, with a greater aptitude to express thoughts of a deeper\r\nnature.'\r\n\r\n§ 20. Most of the instances in which Chaucer's rendering is inaccurate,\r\nunhappy, or insufficient are pointed out in the notes.

To me, it is not quite easy; for the senses\r\nof the M.E. _nede_ and _lakken_ are very slippery. Suppose we make them\r\nchange places, and read:--'Wenest thou that he, that hath lak of power,\r\nthat him ne nedeth no-thing?' This may be better, but it is not wholly\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\niii. pr.9. 39-41. that he ... yif him nedeth = whether he needeth.

In the case of a few supposed errors, as pointed out by Mr. Stewart,\r\nthere remains something to be said on the other side. I note the following\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\ni. pr. 6. 28. Lat. 'uelut hiante ualli robore.' Here Mr. Stewart quotes the\r\nreading of MS. A., viz. 'so as the strengthe of the paleys schynyng is\r\nopen.' But the English text in that MS. is corrupt. The correct reading is\r\n'palis chyning;' where _palis_ means _palisade_, and translates _ualli_;\r\nand _chyning is open_ means _is gaping open_, and translates _hiante_.\r\n\r\nii. pr. 5. 16. Lat. 'largiendi usu.' The translation has: 'by usage of\r\nlarge yevinge _of him that hath yeven it_.' I fail to see much amiss; for\r\nthe usual sense of _large_ in M. E. is _liberal_, _bounteous_, _lavish_. Of\r\ncourse we must not substitute the modern sense without justification.\r\n\r\nii. pr. 5. 35. 'of the laste beautee' translates Lat. 'postremae\r\npulcritudinis.' For this, see my note on p. 431.\r\n\r\nii. pr. 7. 38. Lat. 'tum commercii insolentia.' Chaucer has: 'what for\r\ndefaute of unusage and entrecomuninge of marchaundise.' There is not much\r\namiss; but MS. A. omits the word _and_ after _unusage_, which of course\r\nmakes nonsense of the passage.\r\n\r\nii. met. 8. 6. Lat. 'Ut fluctus auidum mare Certo fine coerceat.' Chaucer\r\nhas: 'that the see, greedy to flowen, constreyned with a certein ende hise\r\nfloodes.' Mr. Stewart understands 'greedy to flowen' to refer to 'fluctus\r\nauidum.' It seems to me that this was merely Chaucer's first idea of the\r\npassage, and that he afterwards meant 'hise floodes' to translate\r\n'fluctus,' but forgot to strike out 'to flowen.' I do not defend the\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\niii. pr. 11. 86. Lat. 'sede;' Eng. 'sete.' This is quite right. Mr. Stewart\r\nquotes the Eng. version as having 'feete,' but this is only a corrupt\r\nreading, though found in the best MS. Any one who is acquainted with M. E.\r\nMSS. will easily guess that 'feete' is merely mis-copied from 'seete,' with\r\na long _s_; and, indeed, _sete_ is the reading of the black-letter\r\neditions. There is a blunder here, certainly; only it is not the author's,\r\nbut due to the scribes.\r\n\r\niv. pr. 6. 176. Lat. 'quidam me quoque excellentior:' Eng. 'a philosophre,\r\nthe more excellent by me.' The M. E. use of _by_ is ambiguous; it\r\nfrequently means 'in comparison with.'\r\n\r\nv. met. 5. 14. Lat. 'male dissipis:' Eng. 'wexest yvel out of thy wit.' In\r\nthis case, _wexest out of thy wit_ translates _dissipis_; and _yvel_, which\r\nis here an adverb, translates _male_.\r\n\r\nOf course we must also make allowances for the variations in Chaucer's\r\nLatin MS. from the usually received text. Here we are much assisted by MS.\r\nC., which, as explained below, appears to contain a copy of the very text\r\nwhich he consulted, and helps to settle several doubtful points. To take\r\ntwo examples. In Book ii. met. 5. 17, Chaucer has 'ne hadde nat deyed yit\r\n_armures_,' where the usual Lat. text has 'tinxerat _arua_.' But many MSS.\r\nhave _arma_; and, of these, MS. C. is one.\r\n\r\nOnce more, in Book ii. met. 2. 11, Chaucer has 'sheweth _other_ gapinges,'\r\nwhere the usual Lat. text has '_Altos_ pandit hiatus.' But some MSS. have\r\n_Alios_; and, of these, MS. C. is one.\r\n\r\n§ 22. After all, the chief point of interest about Chaucer's translation of\r\nBoethius is the influence that this labour exercised upon his later work,\r\nowing to the close familiarity with the text which he thus acquired. I have\r\nshewn that we must not expect to find such influence upon his earliest\r\nwritings; and that, in the case of the Book of the Duchesse, it affected\r\nhim at second hand, through Jean de Meun. But in other poems, viz. Troilus,\r\nthe House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women, some of the Balades, and in\r\nthe Canterbury Tales, the influence of Boethius is frequently observable;\r\nand we may usually suppose such influence to have been direct and\r\nimmediate; nevertheless, we should always keep an eye on Le Roman de la\r\nRose, for Jean de Meun was, in like manner, influenced in no slight degree\r\nby the same work. I have often taken an opportunity of pointing out, in my\r\nNotes to Chaucer, passages of this character; and I find that Mr. Stewart,\r\nwith praiseworthy diligence, has endeavoured to give (in Appendix B,\r\nfollowing his Essay, at p. 260) 'An Index of Passages in Chaucer which seem\r\nto have been suggested by the De Consolatione Philosophiae.' Very useful,\r\nin connection with this subject, is the list of passages in which Chaucer\r\nseems to have been indebted to Le Roman de la Rose, as given by Dr. E.\r\nKöppel in _Anglia_, vol. xiv. 238-265. Another most useful help is the\r\ncomparison between Troilus and Boccaccio's _Filostrato_, by Mr. W. M.\r\nRossetti; which sometimes proves, beyond all doubt, that a passage which\r\nmay seem to be due to Boethius, is really taken from the Italian poet. As\r\nthis seems to be the right place for exhibiting the results thus obtained,\r\nI proceed to give them, and gladly express my thanks to the above-named\r\nauthors for the opportunity thus afforded.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23.

It is worth while to see what light is thrown upon the chronology of\r\nthe Canterbury Tales by comparison with Boethius.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we may remark that, of the Tales mentioned above, there\r\nis nothing to shew that The Seconde Nonnes Tale, the Clerkes Tale, or even\r\nthe Tale of Melibeus, really refer to any passages in Boethius. They may,\r\nin fact, have been written _before_ that translation was made. In the\r\ninstance of the Second Nonnes Tale, this was certainly the case; and it is\r\nnot unlikely that the same is true with respect to the others.\r\n\r\nBut the following Tales (_as revised_) seem to be later than 'Boece,' viz.\r\nThe Knightes Tale, The Man of Lawes Tale, and The Monkes Tale; whilst it is\r\nquite certain that the following Tales were amongst the latest written,\r\nviz. the Nonne Preestes Tale, the three tales in Group D (Wyf, Frere,\r\nSomnour), the Marchantes Tale, the Squieres Tale, the Frankeleins Tale, the\r\nCanouns Yemannes Tale, and the Maunciples Tale; all of which are in the\r\nheroic couplet, and later than 1385.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Knightes Tale is especially interesting; for the numerous\r\nreferences in it to Boece, and the verbal resemblances between it and\r\nTroilus shew that _either_ the original _Palamoun and Arcite_ was written\r\njust after those works, _or else_ (which is more likely) it was revised,\r\nand became the Knight's Tale, nearly at that time. The connection between\r\nPalamon and Arcite, Anelida, and the Parlement of Foules, and the\r\nintroduction of three stanzas from the Teseide near the end of Troilus,\r\nrender the former supposition unlikely; whilst at the same time we are\r\nconfirmed in the impression that the (revised) Knightes Tale succeeded\r\nBoece and Troilus at no long interval, and was, in fact, the _first_ of the\r\nCanterbury Tales that was written _expressly for the purpose_ of being\r\ninserted in that collection, viz. about 1385-6.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 25. THE MANUSCRIPTS.\r\n\r\nI have now to explain the sources of the present edition.\r\n\r\n1. MS. C. = MS. Camb. Ii. 3. 21. This MS., in the Cambridge University\r\nLibrary, is certainly the best; and has therefore been taken as the basis\r\nof the text. The English portion of it was printed by Dr. Furnivall for the\r\nChaucer Society in 1886; and I have usually relied upon this very useful\r\nedition[40]. It is a fine folio MS., wholly occupied with Boethius (_De\r\nConsolatione Philosophiae_), and comments upon it.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into two distinct parts, which have been bound up together.\r\nThe latter portion consists of a lengthy commentary upon Boethius, at the\r\nend of which we find the title, viz.--'Exposicio preclara quam Iohannes\r\nTheutonicus prescripsit et finiuit Anno d_omi_ni M^oCCCvj viij ydus Iunii;'\r\ni.e. An Excellent Commentary, written by Johannes Teutonicus, and finished\r\nJune 6, 1306. This vast commentary occupies 118 folios, in double columns.\r\n\r\nThe former part of the volume concerns us more nearly. I take it to be, for\r\nall practical purposes, _the authentic copy_. For it presents the following\r\npeculiarities. It contains the whole of the Latin text, as well as\r\nChaucer's English version; and it is surprising to find that these are\r\nwritten in alternate chapters. Thus the volume begins with the Latin text\r\nof Metre 1, at the close of which there follows immediately, on the same\r\npage, Chaucer's translation of Metre 1. Next comes Prose 1 in Latin,\r\nfollowed by Prose 1 in English; and so throughout.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we examine the Latin text, there seems reason to suppose that it\r\nfairly represents the very recension which Chaucer used. It abounds with\r\nside-notes and glosses, all in Latin; and the glosses correspond to those\r\nin Chaucer's version. Thus, to take an example, the following lines occur\r\nnear the end of Bk. iii. met. 11:--\r\n\r\n 'Nam cur rogati sponte recte[41] censetis\r\n  Ni mersus alto uiueret fomes corde.'\r\n\r\nOver _rogati_ is written the gloss _i. interrogato_.\r\n\r\nOver _censetis_ is written _i. iudicatis_.\r\n\r\nOver _Ni_ is _i. nisi_; over _mersus alto_ is _i. latenter conditos_; over\r\n_uiueret_ is _i. vigeret_; and over _fomes_ is _i. radix veritatis_.\r\n\r\nBesides these glosses, there is here the following side-note:--'Nisi radix\r\nveritatis latenter conditus vigeret in abscondito mentis, homo non\r\niudicaret recta quacunque ordinata interrogata.'\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to Chaucer's version, we find that he first gives a\r\ntranslation of the two verses, thus:--\r\n\r\n'For wherefor elles demen ye of your owne wil the rightes, whan ye ben\r\naxed, but-yif so were that the norisshinge of resoun ne livede y-plounged\r\nin the depthe of your herte?'\r\n\r\nAfter this he adds, by way of comment:--'This is to seyn, how sholden men\r\ndemen the sooth of anything that were axed, yif ther nere a rote of\r\nsoothfastnesse that were y-plounged and hid in naturel principles, the\r\nwhiche soothfastnesse lived with-in the deepnesse of the thought.'\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that he has here reproduced the general sense of the Latin\r\nside-note above quoted. The chief thing which is missing in the Latin is\r\nthe expression 'in naturel principles.' But we have only to look to a\r\npassage a little higher up, and we find the line--\r\n\r\n 'Suis retrusum possidere thesauris.'\r\n\r\nOver the word _retrusum_ is written _i. absconditum_; and over _thesauris_\r\nis _i. naturalibus policiis et principiis naturaliter inditis_. Out of\r\nthese we have only to pick the words _absconditum naturalibus ...\r\nprincipiis_, and we at once obtain the missing phrase--'hid in naturel\r\nprinciples.'\r\n\r\nOr, to take another striking example. Bk. iv. met. 7 begins, in the MS.,\r\nwith the lines:\r\n\r\n 'Bella bis quinis operatus annis\r\n  Vltor attrides frigie ruinis,\r\n  Fratris amissos thalamos piauit.'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, just above these, is written a note: 'Istud metrum est de\r\ntribus exemplis: de agamenone (_sic_); secundum de vlixe; tertium, de\r\nhercule.'\r\n\r\nThe glosses are these; over _quinis_ is _i. decim_; over _attrides_ is\r\n_agamenon_ (_sic_); over _Fratris_ is _s. menelai_; and over _piauit_ is\r\n_i. vlcissendo_ (_sic_) _purgauit: troia enim erat metropolis Frigie_.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to Chaucer's version, in which I print the additions to the text\r\nin italics, we find that it runs thus:--\r\n\r\n'The wreker Attrides, _that is to seyn, Agamenon_, that wroughte and\r\ncontinuede the batailes by ten yeer, recovered and purgede _in wrekinge_,\r\nby the destruccioun of Troye, the loste chaumbres of mariage of his\r\nbrother; _this is to seyn, that he, Agamenon, wan ayein Eleyne, that was\r\nMenelaus wyf his brother_.'\r\n\r\nWe see how this was made up. Not a little curious are the spellings\r\n_Attrides_ and _Agamenon_[42], as occurring both in the Latin part of this\r\nMS. and in Chaucer's version. Again, Chaucer has _ten_, corresponding to\r\nthe gloss _decim_, not to the textual phrase _bis quinis_. His explanation\r\nof _piauit_ by _recovered and purgede in wrekinge_ is clearly due to the\r\ngloss _ulciscendo purgauit_. His substitution of _Troye_ for _Frigie_ is\r\ndue to the gloss: _troia enim erat metropolis Frigie_. And even the name\r\n_Menelaus his brother_ answers to _Fratris, s. menelai_. And all that is\r\nleft, as being absolutely his own, are the words _and continuede_,\r\n_recovered_, and _wan ayein Eleyne_. We soon discover that, in a hundred\r\ninstances, he renders a single Latin verb or substantive by two English\r\nverbs or substantives, by way of making the sense clearer; which accounts\r\nfor his introduction of the verbs _continuede_ and _recovered_; and this\r\nconsideration reduces Chaucer's additional contribution to a mention of the\r\nname of _Eleyne_, which was of course extremely familiar to him.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we find in this MS. the original of the gloss explaining\r\n_coempcioun_ (p. 11); of the 'Glose' on p. 15; of the 'Glosa' on p. 26; and\r\nof most of the notes which, at first sight, look like additions by Chaucer\r\nhimself[43].\r\n\r\nThe result is that, in all difficulties, the first authority to be\r\nconsulted is the Latin text in this particular MS.; for we are easily led\r\nto conclude that it was intentionally designed to preserve both Chaucer's\r\ntranslation and the original text. It does not follow that it is always\r\nperfect; for it can only be a _copy_ of the Latin, and the scribe may err.\r\nIn writing _recte_ for _recta_ (see note on p. xxxviii), he has certainly\r\ncommitted an error by a slip of the pen. The same mistake has been observed\r\nto occur in another MS., viz. Codex Gothanus I.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback is this. The MS. is so crowded with glosses and\r\nside-notes, many of them closely written in small characters, that it is\r\nalmost impossible to consult them all. I have therefore contented myself\r\nwith resorting to them for information in difficult passages only. For\r\nfurther remarks on this subject, I must refer the reader to the Notes.\r\n\r\nLastly, I may observe that the design of preserving in this MS. all the\r\napparatus referring to Chaucer's Boethius, is made the more apparent by the\r\ncurious fact that, _in this MS. only_, the two poems by Chaucer that are\r\nclosely related to Boethius, viz. The Former Age, and Fortune, are actually\r\ninserted into the very body of it, immediately after Bk. ii. met. 5. This\r\nplace was of course chosen because The Former Age is, to some extent, a\r\nverse translation of that metre; and Fortune was added because, being\r\nfounded upon scraps from several chapters, it had no definite claim to any\r\nspecific place of its own.\r\n\r\nIn this MS., the English text, like the Latin one, has a few imperfections.\r\nOne imperfection appears in certain peculiarities of spelling. The scribe\r\nseems to have had some habits of pronunciation that betoken a greater\r\nfamiliarity with Anglo-French than with English. The awkward position of\r\nthe guttural sound of _gh_ in _neighebour_ seems to have been too much for\r\nhim; hence he substituted _ssh_ (= _sh-sh_) for _gh_, and gives us the\r\nspelling _neysshebour_ (Bk. ii. pr. 3. 24, foot-note; pr. 7. 57,\r\nfoot-note.) Nevertheless, it is the best MS. and has most authority. For\r\nfurther remarks, see the account of the present edition, on pp.\r\nxlvi-xlviii.\r\n\r\n2. MS. Camb. Ii. 1. 38. This MS. also belongs to the Cambridge University\r\nLibrary, and was written early in the fifteenth century. It contains 8\r\ncomplete quires of 8 leaves, and 1 incomplete quire of 6 leaves, making 70\r\nleaves in all. The English version appears alone, and occupies 68 leaves,\r\nand part of leaf 69 recto; leaf 69, verso, and leaf 70, are blank. The last\r\nwords are:--'þe eyen of þe Iuge þat seeth and demeth alle thinges.\r\n_Explicit liber boecij, &c._' Other treatises, in Latin, are bound up with\r\nit, but are unrelated. The readings of this MS. agree very closely with\r\nthose of Ii. 3. 21, and of our text. Thus, in Met. i. l. 9, it has the\r\nreading _wyerdes_, with the gloss _s. fata_, as in Ii. 3. 21. (The scribe\r\nat first wrote _wyerldes_, but the _l_ is marked for expunction.) In l. 12,\r\nit has _emptid_, whereas the Addit. MS. has _emty_; and in l. 16 it has\r\n_nayteth_, whereas the Addit. MS. wrongly has _naieth_. On account of its\r\nclose agreement with the text, I have made but little use of it.\r\n\r\nIt is worth notice that this MS. (like Harl. 2421) frequently has correct\r\nreadings in cases where even the MS. above described exhibits some blunder.\r\nA few such instances are given in the notes. For example, it has the\r\nreading _wrythith_ in Bk. i. met. 4. 7, where MS. C. has the absurd word\r\n_writith_, and MS. A. has _wircheth_. In the very next line, it has\r\n_thonder-leit_, and it is highly probable that _leit_ is the real word, and\r\n_light_ an ignorant substitution; for _leit_ (answering to A.S. _l[=e]get_,\r\n_l[=i]get_) is the right M.E. word for 'lightning'; see the examples in\r\nStratmann. So again, in Bk. ii. met. 3. 13, it reads _ouer-whelueth_, like\r\nthe black-letter editions; whilst MS. C. turns _whelueth_ into _welueeth_,\r\nand MS. A. gives the spelling _whelweth_. In Bk. ii. pr. 6. 63, it\r\ncorrectly retains _I_ after _may_, though MSS. C. and A. both omit it. In\r\nBk. ii. pr. 8. 17, it has _wyndy_, not _wyndynge_; and I shew (in the note\r\nat p. 434) that _windy_ is, after all, the correct reading, since the Lat.\r\ntext has _uentosam_. In Bk. iii. met. 3. 1, it resembles the printed\r\neditions in the insertion of the words _or a goter_ after _river_. In Bk.\r\niv. pr. 3. 47, 48, it preserves the missing words: _peyne, he ne douteth\r\nnat þat he nys entecchid and defouled with_. In Bk. iv. met. 6. 24, it has\r\nthe right reading, viz. _brethith_. Finally, it usually retains the word\r\n_whylom_ in places where the MS. next described substitutes the word\r\n_somtyme_. If any difficulty in the text raises future discussion, it is\r\nclear that this MS. should be consulted.\r\n\r\n3. MS. A. = MS. Addit. 10340, in the British Museum. This is the MS.\r\nprinted at length by Dr. Morris for the Early English Text Society, and\r\ndenoted by the letter 'A.' in my foot-notes. As it is so accessible, I need\r\nsay but little. It is less correct than MS. Ii. 3. 21 in many readings, and\r\nthe spelling, on the whole, is not so good. The omissions in it are also\r\nmore numerous, but it occasionally preserves a passage which the Cambridge\r\nMS. omits. It is also imperfect, as it omits Prose 8 and Metre 8 of Bk.\r\nii., and Prose 1 of Bk. iii. It has been collated throughout, though I have\r\nusually refrained from quoting such readings from it as are evidently\r\ninferior or wrong. I notice one peculiarity in particular, viz. that it\r\nalmost invariably substitutes the word _somtyme_ for the _whylom_ found in\r\nother copies; and _whylom_, in this treatise, is a rather common word. Dr.\r\nMorris's account of the MS. is here copied.\r\n\r\n'The Additional MS. is written by a scribe who was unacquainted with the\r\nforce of the final _-e_. Thus he adds it to the preterites of strong verbs,\r\nwhich do not require it; he omits it in the preterites of weak verbs where\r\nit is wanted, and attaches it to passive participles of weak verbs, where\r\nit is superfluous. The scribe of the Cambridge MS. is careful to preserve\r\nthe final _-e_ where it is a sign (1) of the definite declension of the\r\nadjective; (2) of the plural adjective; (3) of the infinitive mood; (4) of\r\nthe preterite of weak verbs; (5) of present participles; (6) of the 2nd\r\npers. pret. indic. of strong verbs; (7) of adverbs; (8) of an older\r\nvowel-ending.\r\n\r\n'The Addit. MS. has frequently _thilk_ (singular and plural) and _-nes_ (in\r\n_wrechednes_, &c.), when the Camb. MS. has _thilke_ (as usual in the\r\nCanterbury Tales) and _-nesse_.'\r\n\r\nThe copy of Boethius is contained on foll. 3-40. On fol. 41, recto, is a\r\ncopy of Chaucer's _Truth_, and the description of the 'Persone,' extracted\r\nfrom the Prologue to the Cant. Tales. The other side of the leaf is blank.\r\nThis is, in fact, the MS. which I denote by 'At.,' as described in the\r\nIntroduction to the 'Minor Poems' in vol. i. p. 57.\r\n\r\n4. MS. Addit. 16165, in the British Museum. This is one of Shirley's MSS.,\r\nbeing that which I denote by 'Ad.,' and have described in the Introduction\r\nto the 'Minor Poems' in vol. i. p. 56. I believe this MS. to be of less\r\nvalue than MS. A. (above), and have therefore not collated it; for even A.\r\nis not a very good authority.\r\n\r\n5. MS. Harl. 2421. The Harleian Catalogue describes it thus: 'Torq. Sever.\r\nBoetius: his 5 Books of the Comfort of Philosophy. Translated into English.\r\nOn vellum, 152 leaves. XV century.'\r\n\r\nA small quarto MS. of the middle of the fifteenth century. The first Prose\r\nof Bk. i. begins (like MS. A.) with the words: 'In þe mene while þat y stil\r\nrecorded þese þinges;' &c. Hence are derived the readings marked 'H.' in\r\nMorris's edition, pp. 62-64. It rightly reads _writheth_, _wyndy_,\r\n_bretheth_ (see p. xlii).\r\n\r\n6. The celebrated Hengwrt MS. of the Canterbury Tales (denoted by 'Hn.' in\r\nthe foot-notes to that poem) contains a part of Chaucer's Boethius. See the\r\nSecond Report of the Historical MSS. Commission, p. 106.\r\n\r\n7. There is also a copy in a MS. belonging to the Cathedral Library at\r\nSalisbury. It was discovered by Dr. Wülker in 1875; see the _Academy_ for\r\nOct. 5, 1875. Bk. i. met. 1 was printed, from this MS., by Dr. Wülker in\r\n_Anglia_, ii. 373. It resembles MS. A.\r\n\r\n8. In the Phillipps collection, MS. no. 9472 is described as 'Boetius' Boke\r\nof Comfort,' and is said to be of the fifteenth century. I do not know its\r\nreal contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 26. THE PRINTED EDITIONS.\r\n\r\nCAXTON. Chaucer's Boethius was first printed by Caxton, without date; but\r\nprobably before 1479. See the description in The Biography and Typography\r\nof W. Caxton, by W. Blades; second edition, 1882; p. 213. A complete\r\ncollation of this text with MS. A., as printed by Morris, was printed by L.\r\nKellner, of Vienna, in Englische Studien, vol. xiv, pp. 1-53; of which I\r\nhave gladly availed myself. The text agrees very closely indeed with that\r\nprinted by Thynne in 1532, and resembles MS. C. rather than MS. A.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is necessary to remark that the readings of MS. C., as given in\r\nKellner's collation, are sometimes incorrect, because MS. C. had not at\r\nthat time been printed, and the readings of that MS. were only known to him\r\nfrom the foot-notes in Morris's edition, which are not exhaustive, but only\r\nrecord the more important variations. There is a curious but natural error,\r\nfor example, in his note on l. 1002 of Morris's edition (Bk. ii. met. 3.\r\n14, p. 32, l. 1), where MS. C. has _[gh]eelde_ (= _zeelde_). The word is\r\nmissing in MS. A., but Morris supplied it from C. to complete the text.\r\nHence the foot-note has: '[_[gh]eelde_]--from C.'; meaning that A. omits\r\n_[gh]eelde_, which is supplied from C. This Kellner took to mean that A.\r\nhas _[gh]eelde_, and C. has _from_. However, the readings of A. and of\r\nCaxton are given with all possible care and minuteness; and now that C. is\r\nalso in type, the slight inevitable errors are easily put right. This\r\nexcellent piece of work has saved me much trouble.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that Caxton's text is of great value. He followed a MS. (now\r\nlost) which is, in some places, even more correct than MS. C. The following\r\nreadings are of great importance, as they correct MSS. C. and A. (I denote\r\nCaxton's edition by the symbol Cx.)\r\n\r\nBk. i. met. 4. 7. Cx. writheth. (Cf. p. xlii. above, l. 6.)\r\n\r\nBk. i. met. 4. 8. Cx. thonder leyte[44].\r\n\r\nBk. i. met. 5. 26. Cx. punisheth.\r\n\r\nBk. i. met. 5. 28. Cx. on the nekkes.\r\n\r\nBk. i. pr. 6. 54. Cx. funden (_but read_ founden).\r\n\r\nBk. i. pr. 6. 65. Cx. norissing. (Perhaps better than _norisshinges_, as in\r\nthe MSS.; for the Lat. text has the sing. _fomitem_.) Cf. Bk. iii. met. 11.\r\n27.\r\n\r\nBk. ii. pr. 3. 59. Cx. seeld (_better_ selde). It is clear that _yelde_ in\r\nMS. A. arose from a reading _[gh]elde_, which really meant _zelde_, the\r\nSouthern form of _selde_. See below.\r\n\r\nBk. ii. met. 3. 14. Cx. selde (_correctly_). And so again in Bk. ii. pr. 6.\r\n15.\r\n\r\nBk. ii. pr. 6. 63. Cx. may I most. (MSS. C. A. _omit_ I.)\r\n\r\nBk. ii. pr. 8. 17. Cx. wyndy (which is right; see note, p. 434).\r\n\r\nBk. iii. pr. 1. 26. Cx. thyne (_better_ thyn, _as in_ Thynne).\r\n\r\nBk. iii. pr. 10. 10. Cx. denyed (_or read_ deneyed).\r\n\r\nBk. iii. pr. 10. 51. Cx. that the fader. (MSS. that this prince.) Caxton's\r\ntranslation is closer; Lat. text, _patrem_.\r\n\r\nBk. iii. pr. 11. 116. Cx. slepen.\r\n\r\nBk. iii. pr. 11. 152. Cx. maistow (Thynne _has_ mayst thou) MS. C. _omits_\r\nthou; and MS. A. is defective.\r\n\r\nBk. iii. pr. 12. 143. Cx. Parmenides.\r\n\r\nBk. iv. pr. 6. 52. Cx. be cleped.\r\n\r\nBk. iv. pr. 6. 188, 189. Cx. and some dispyse that they mowe not here\r\n(_misprint for_ bere). MSS. C. and A. omit this clause.\r\n\r\nBk. v. pr. 1. 9, 10. Cx. assoilen to the the dette (where the former _the_\r\n= thee).\r\n\r\nBk. v. pr. 3. 142. Cx. impetren.\r\n\r\nIn a few places, Caxton's text is somewhat fuller than that of the MSS.\r\nThus in Bk. ii. pr. 3. 8, Cx. has: thei ben herd _and sowne in eeres_ thei,\r\n&c. However, the Lat. text has merely: 'cum audiuntur.' And again, only 9\r\nlines lower (l. 17), Cx. inserts _and ajuste_ after _moeve_; but the Lat.\r\ntext has merely: 'admouebo.' In some cases, it is closer to the Latin text;\r\nas, e. g. in Bk. i. met. 3. 9, where Cx. has _kaue_ (Lat. _antro_), whereas\r\nMSS. C. and A. have the pl. _kaues_. In Bk. i. pr. 3. 41, where C. has the\r\nE. form _Sorans_, Cx. preserves the Latin form _Soranos_.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that a collation with Caxton's text is of considerable\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nTHYNNE. Thynne's edition of Chaucer, printed in 1532, contains Boethius. I\r\nsuspect that Thynne simply reprinted Caxton's text, without consulting any\r\nother authority; for it is hard to detect any difference, except that his\r\nspellings are somewhat less archaic. Hence this text, by a lucky accident,\r\nis an extremely good one, and I have constantly referred to it in all cases\r\nof difficulty. Readings from this edition are marked in the foot-notes with\r\nthe symbol 'Ed.'\r\n\r\nThe later black-letter copies are mere reprints of Thynne's text, each\r\nbeing, as usual, a little worse than its predecessor, owing to the\r\nintroduction of misprints and later forms. I have consulted the editions of\r\n1550 (undated) and 1561. Perhaps the most readable edition is that by\r\nChalmers, in vol. i. of his British Poets, as it is in Roman type. It\r\nclosely resembles the edition of 1561, and is therefore not very correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 27. THE PRESENT EDITION.\r\n\r\nThe present edition is, practically, the first in which the preparation of\r\nthe text has received adequate attention. Caxton's edition probably\r\nrepresents a single MS., though a very good one; and all the black-letter\r\neditions merely reproduce the same text, with various new errors. Dr.\r\nMorris's edition was unfortunately founded on an inferior MS., as he\r\ndiscovered before the printing of it was completed. Dr. Furnivall's text\r\nreproduces the excellent MS. C., but collation was rightly refrained from,\r\nas his object was to give the exact spellings of the MS. for the benefit of\r\nstudents. Hence there are several passages, in both of these editions,\r\nwhich do not afford the best sense; in a few places, they are less correct\r\nthan the black-letter editions. It is also a considerable drawback to the\r\nreader, that they reproduce, of course intentionally and fully, the\r\ntroublesome and obscure punctuation-marks of the MSS.\r\n\r\nFinding the ground thus clear, I have taken occasion to introduce the\r\nfollowing improvements. The text is founded on MS. C., certainly the best\r\nextant authority, which it follows, on the whole, very closely. At the same\r\ntime, it has been carefully collated throughout with the text of MS. A.,\r\nand (what is even more important) with the texts printed by Caxton and\r\nThynne and with the original Latin text (1) as given in the edition by\r\nObbarius (Jena 1843)[45] and (2) as existing in MS. C. The latter usually\r\ngives the exact readings of the MS. used by Chaucer himself. By taking\r\nthese precautions, I have introduced a considerable number of necessary\r\ncorrections, so that we now possess a very close approximation to the\r\noriginal text as it left Chaucer's hands. In all cases where emendations\r\nare made, the various readings are given in the foot-notes, where 'C.' and\r\n'A.' refer to the two chief MSS., and 'Ed.' refers to Thynne's first\r\nedition (1532). But I have intentionally refrained from crowding these\r\nfoot-notes with inferior readings which are certainly false. Some readings\r\nfrom the excellent MS. Ii. 1. 38 are given in the Notes; I now wish that I\r\nhad collated it throughout. I have introduced modern punctuation. As I am\r\nhere entirely responsible, the reader is at liberty to alter it, provided\r\nthat he is justified in so doing by the Latin text.\r\n\r\nWherever Chaucer has introduced explanatory words and phrases which are not\r\nin the Latin text, I have printed them _in italics_; as in lines 6, 7, and\r\n18 on page 1. However, these words and phrases are seldom original; they\r\nare usually translated or adapted from some of the Latin glosses and notes\r\nwith which MS. C. abounds; as explained above, at p. xxxviii.\r\n\r\nI have also adopted an entirely new system of numbering. In Dr. Morris's\r\nedition, every line of the _printed_ text is numbered consecutively, from 1\r\nup to 5219, which is the last line of the treatise. In Dr. Furnivall's\r\nprint of MS. C., a new numbering begins on every page, from 1 to 32, 33,\r\n34, or 35. Both these methods are entirely useless for general reference.\r\nThe right method of reference is Tyrwhitt's, viz. to treat every chapter\r\nseparately. Thus a reference to 'Bk. 1. met. 2' serves for every edition;\r\nbut I have further taken occasion to number the lines of every chapter, for\r\ngreater convenience. Thus the word _acountinge_ occurs in Bk. i. met. 2.\r\n10: and even in referring to a black-letter edition, the number 10 is of\r\nsome use, since it shews that the word occurs very nearly _in the middle_\r\nof the Metre. The usual method of referring to editions _by the page_ is an\r\nextremely poor and inconvenient makeshift; and it is really nearly time\r\nthat editors should learn this elementary lesson. Unfortunately, some\r\ndifficulty will always remain as to the numbering of the lines of _prose_\r\nworks, because the length of each line is indefinite. The longest chapter,\r\nBk. iv. pr. 6, here extends to 258 lines; the shortest, Bk. iii. met. 3,\r\nhas less than 7 lines.\r\n\r\nI have also corrected the spelling of MS. C. in a large number of places,\r\nbut within very narrow limits. The use of the final _e_ in that MS. is\r\nexceedingly correct, and has almost always been followed, except where\r\nnotice to the contrary is given in the notes. My corrections are chiefly\r\nlimited to the substitution of _in_ for _yn_, and of _i_ for short _y_, in\r\nsuch words as _bygynnen_, for which I write _biginnen_; the substitution of\r\n_y_ for long _i_, as in _whylom_, when the MS. has _whilom_; the use of _v_\r\nfor the MS. symbol _u_ (where necessary); the substitution of _sch_ or\r\n_ssh_ for _ss_, when the sound intended is double _sh_; and the\r\nsubstitution of _e_ and _o_ for _ee_ and _oo_ where the vowels are\r\nobviously long by their position in the word. I also substitute _-eth_ and\r\n_-ed_ for the variable _-eth_ or _-ith_, and _-ed_, _-id,_ or _-yd_ of the\r\nMS. Such changes render the text more uniformly phonetic, and much more\r\nreadable, without really interfering with the evidence. Changes of a bolder\r\ncharacter are duly noted.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of these slight improvements will not really trouble the\r\nreader. The trouble has been the editor's; for I found that the only\r\nsatisfactory way of producing a really good text was to rewrite the whole\r\nof it. It seemed worth while to have a useful critical edition of\r\n'Boethius' for general reference, because of the considerable use which\r\nChaucer himself made of his translation when writing many of his later\r\npoems.\r\n\r\nThe Notes are all new, in the sense that no annotated edition of Chaucer's\r\ntext has hitherto appeared. But many of them are, necessarily, copied or\r\nadapted from the notes to the Latin text in the editions by Vallinus and\r\nValpy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO TROILUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. DATE OF THE WORK. The probable date is about 1380-2, and can hardly\r\nhave been earlier than 1379 or later than 1383. No doubt it was in hand for\r\na considerable time. It certainly followed close upon the translation of\r\nBoethius; see p. vii above.\r\n\r\n§ 2. SOURCES OF THE WORK. The chief authority followed by Chaucer is\r\nBoccaccio's poem named _Il Filostrato_, in 9 Parts or Books of very\r\nvariable length, and composed in ottava rima, or stanzas containing eight\r\nlines each. I have used the copy in the Opere Volgari di G. Boccaccio;\r\nFirenze, 1832.\r\n\r\nOwing to the patient labours of Mr. W. M. Rossetti, who has collated the\r\n_Filostrato_ with the _Troilus_ line by line, and published the results of\r\nhis work for the Chaucer Society in 1875, we are able to tell the precise\r\nextent to which Chaucer is indebted to Boccaccio for this story. The\r\n_Filostrato_ contains 5704 lines; and the _Troilus_ 8239 lines[46], if we\r\ndo not reckon in the 12 Latin lines printed below, at p. 404. Hence we\r\nobtain the following result.\r\n\r\n  Total of lines in _Troilus_       8239\r\n  Adapted from the _Filostrato_\r\n     (2730 lines, condensed into)   2583\r\n                                    ----\r\n         Balance due to Chaucer     5656\r\n\r\nIn other words, Chaucer's debt to Boccaccio amounts to _less than_\r\none-third of the whole poem; and there remains more than two-thirds of it\r\nto be accounted for from other sources. But even after all deductions have\r\nbeen made for passages borrowed from other authors, very nearly two-thirds\r\nremain for which Chaucer is solely responsible. As in the case of the\r\nKnightes Tale, close investigation shews that Chaucer is, after all, less\r\nindebted to Boccaccio than might seem, upon a hasty comparison, to be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAs it was found impracticable to give Mr. Rossetti's results in full, I\r\nhave drawn up lists of parallel passages in a somewhat rough way, which are\r\ngiven in the Notes, at the beginning of every Book; see pp. 461, 467, 474,\r\n484, 494. These lists are sufficiently accurate to enable the reader, in\r\ngeneral, to discover the passages which are in no way due to the\r\n_Filostrato_.\r\n\r\n§ 3. I have taken occasion, at the same time, to note _other_ passages for\r\nwhich Chaucer is indebted to some other authors. Of these we may\r\nparticularly note the following. In Book I, lines 400-420 are translated\r\nfrom Petrarch's 88th Sonnet, which is quoted at length at p. 464. In Book\r\nIII, lines 813-833, 1625-9, and 1744-1768 are all from the second Book of\r\nBoethius (Prose 4, 86-120 and 4-10, and Metre 8). In Book IV, lines\r\n974-1078 are from Boethius, Book V. In Book V, lines 1-14 and 1807-27 are\r\nfrom various parts of Boccaccio's _Teseide_; and a part of the last stanza\r\nis from Dante. On account of such borrowings, we may subtract about 220\r\nlines more from Chaucer's 'balance'; which still leaves due to him nearly\r\n5436 lines.\r\n\r\n§ 4. Of course it will be readily understood that, in the case of these\r\n5436 lines, numerous short quotations and allusions occur, most of which\r\nare pointed out in the notes. Thus, in Book II, lines 402-3 are from Ovid,\r\nArt. Amat. ii. 118; lines 716-8 are from Le Roman de la Rose[47]; and so\r\non. No particular notice need be taken of this, as similar hints are\r\nutilised in other poems by Chaucer; and, indeed, by all other poets. But\r\nthere is one particular case of borrowing, of considerable importance,\r\nwhich will be considered below, in § 9 (p. liii).\r\n\r\n§ 5. It is, however, necessary to observe here that, in taking his story\r\nfrom Boccaccio, Chaucer has so altered and adapted it as to make it\r\npeculiarly his own; precisely as he has done in the case of the Knightes\r\nTale. Sometimes he translates very closely and even neatly, and sometimes\r\nhe takes a mere hint from a long passage. He expands or condenses his\r\nmaterial at pleasure; and even, in some cases, transposes the order of it.\r\nIt is quite clear that he gave himself a free hand.\r\n\r\nThe most important point is that he did not accept the characters of the\r\nthree chief actors, Troilus, Criseyde, and Pandarus, as pourtrayed by\r\nBoccaccio; he did not even accept all the incidents which gave occasion for\r\ntheir behaviour. Pandarus is no longer the cousin of Criseyde, a young and\r\ndashing gallant, but her middle-aged uncle, with blunted perceptions of\r\nwhat is moral and noble. In fact, Chaucer's Pandarus is a thorough and\r\nperfect study of character, drawn with a dramatic skill not inferior to\r\nthat of Shakespeare, and worthy of the author of the immortal Prologue to\r\nthe Canterbury Tales. I must leave the fuller consideration of these points\r\nto others; it is hardly necessary to repeat, at full length, the Prefatory\r\nRemarks by Mr. Rossetti, whilst at the same time, if I begin to quote from\r\nthem, I shall hardly know where to stop. See also Ten Brink's English\r\nLiterature, and Morley's English Writers, vol. v.\r\n\r\n§ 6. It has been observed that, whilst Chaucer carefully read and made very\r\ngood use of two of Boccaccio's works, viz. Il Filostrato and Il Teseide, he\r\nnowhere mentions Boccaccio by name; and this has occasioned some surprise.\r\nBut we must not apply modern ideas to explain medieval facts, as is so\r\nfrequently done. When we consider how often MSS. of works by known authors\r\nhave no author's name attached to them, it becomes likely that Chaucer\r\nobtained manuscript copies of these works unmarked by the author's name;\r\nand though he must doubtless have been aware of it, there was no cogent\r\nreason why he should declare himself indebted to one in whom Englishmen\r\nwere, as yet, quite uninterested. Even when he refers to Petrarch in the\r\nClerk's Prologue (E 27-35), he has to explain who he was, and to inform\r\nreaders of his recent death. In those days, there was much laxity in the\r\nmode of citing authors.\r\n\r\n§ 7. It will help us to understand matters more clearly, if we further\r\nobserve the haphazard manner in which quotations were often made. We know,\r\nfor example, that no book was more accessible than the Vulgate version of\r\nthe Bible; yet it is quite common to find the most curious mistakes made in\r\nreference to it. The author of Piers Plowman (B. text, iii. 93-95)\r\nattributes to Solomon a passage which he quotes from Job, and (B. vii. 123)\r\nto St. Luke, a passage from St. Matthew; and again (B. vi. 240) to St.\r\nMatthew, a passage from St. Luke. Chaucer makes many mistakes of a like\r\nnature; I will only cite here his reference to Solomon (Cant. Tales, A\r\n4330), as the author of a passage in Ecclesiasticus. Even in modern\r\ndictionaries we find passages cited from 'Dryden' or 'Bacon' at large,\r\nwithout further remark; as if the verification of a reference were of\r\nslight consequence. This may help to explain to us the curious allusion to\r\n_Zanzis_ as being the author of a passage which Chaucer must have known was\r\nfrom his favourite Ovid (see note to Troil. iv. 414), whilst he was, at the\r\nsame time, well aware that Zanzis was not a poet, but a painter (Cant.\r\nTales, C 16); however, in this case we have probably to do with a piece of\r\nour author's delicious banter, since he adds that Pandarus was speaking\r\n'for the nonce.'\r\n\r\nThere is another point about medieval quotations which must by no means be\r\nmissed. They were frequently made, not from the authors themselves, but\r\nfrom manuscript note-books which contained hundreds of choice passages,\r\nfrom all sorts of authors, collected by diligent compilers. Thus it was, I\r\nstrongly suspect, that Albertano of Brescia was enabled to pour out such\r\nquantities of quotations as those which Chaucer copied from him in his Tale\r\nof Melibeus. Thus it was that borrowers of such note-books often trusted to\r\ntheir strong memories for the words of a quotation, yet forgot or mistook\r\nthe author's name; as was readily done when a dozen such names occurred on\r\nevery page. A MS. of this character is before me now. It contains many\r\nsubjects in alphabetical order. Under _Fortitudo_ are given 17 quotations\r\nwhich more or less relate to it, from Ambrose, Gregory, Chrysostom, and the\r\nrest, all in less than a single page. And thus it was, without doubt, that\r\nChaucer made acquaintance with the three scraps of Horace which I shall\r\npresently consider. It is obvious that Chaucer never saw Horace's works in\r\nthe complete state; if he had done so, he would have found a writer after\r\nhis own heart, and he would have quoted him even more freely than he has\r\nquoted Ovid. 'Chaucer on Horace' would have been delightful indeed; but\r\nthis treat was denied, both to him and to us.\r\n\r\n§ 8. The first and second scraps from Horace are hackneyed quotations.\r\n'Multa renascentur' occurs in Troil. ii. 22 (see note, p. 468); and 'Humano\r\ncapiti' in Troil. ii. 1041 (note, p. 472). In the third case (p. 464),\r\nthere is no reason why we should hesitate to accept the theory, suggested\r\nby Dr. G. Latham (_Athenæum_, Oct. 3, 1868) and by Professor Ten Brink\r\nindependently, that the well-known line (Epist. I, 2. 1)--\r\n\r\n 'Troiani belli scriptorem, maxime Lolli,'\r\n\r\nwas misunderstood by Chaucer (or by some one else who misled him) as\r\nimplying that Lollius was the name of a writer on the Trojan war. Those who\r\nare best acquainted with the ways of medieval literature will least\r\nhesitate to adopt this view. It is notorious that _first lines_ of a poem\r\nare frequently quoted apart from their context, and repeated as if they\r\nwere complete; and, however amazing such a blunder may seem to us now,\r\nthere is really nothing very extraordinary about it.\r\n\r\nWe should also notice that Lollius was to Chaucer a mere name, which he\r\nused, in his usual manner, as a sort of convenient embellishment; for he is\r\ninconsistent in his use of it. In Book i. 394, 'myn autour called Lollius'\r\nreally means Petrarch; whereas in Book v. 1653, though the reference is to\r\nthe Filostrato, Bk. viii. st. 8, Chaucer probably meant no more than that\r\nLollius was an author whom the Italian poet might have followed[48]. Cf. my\r\nnote to the House of Fame, 1468, where the name occurs for the third time.\r\nWe may also notice that, in Book iii. 1325, Chaucer bears testimony to the\r\n'excellence' of his 'auctor.' The statement, in Book ii. 14, that he took\r\nthe story 'out of Latin' is less helpful than it appears to be; for 'Latin'\r\nmay mean either Latin or Italian.\r\n\r\n§ 9. I have spoken (§ 4) of 'a particular case of borrowing,' which I now\r\npropose to consider more particularly. The discovery that Chaucer mainly\r\ndrew his materials from Boccaccio seems to have satisfied most enquirers;\r\nand hence it has come to pass that one of Chaucer's sources has been little\r\nregarded, though it is really of some importance. I refer to the Historia\r\nTroiana of Guido delle Colonne[49], or, as Chaucer rightly calls him, Guido\r\nde Columpnis, i.e. Columnis (House of Fame, 1469). Chaucer's obligations to\r\nthis author have been insufficiently explored.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1889, in printing the Legend of Good Women with an accuracy never\r\nbefore attempted, I restored the MS. reading _Guido_ for the _Ouyde_ of all\r\nprevious editions in l. 1396, a clue was thus obtained to a new source for\r\nsome of Chaucer's work. It was thus made clear that the Legend of Hypsipyle\r\nand Medea was primarily derived from this source; and further, that it was\r\nfrom Guido that Chaucer derived his use of _Ilioun_ to mean the citadel of\r\nTroy (Leg. of Good Women, 936, and note). In the Nonne Prestes Tale, B\r\n4331, as was pointed out by Tyrwhitt long ago, the dream of Andromache is\r\ntaken from Guido. And I find in Lounsbury's Studies in Chaucer, ii. 315,\r\nthe significant but insufficient remark, that 'it was in Guido da (_sic_)\r\nColonna's work that Chaucer found the martial deeds of Troilus recounted in\r\nfull, the slaughter he wrought, and the terror he inspired.' Hence we\r\nnaturally come to the question, what incidents in Troilus are expressly due\r\nto Guido?\r\n\r\n§ 10. Before answering this question, it will be best to consider the\r\nfamous _crux_, as to the meaning of the word _Trophee_.\r\n\r\nWhen Lydgate is speaking of his master's Troilus, viz. in his Prologue to\r\nthe Falls of Princes, st. 3, he says that Chaucer\r\n\r\n         'made a translacion\r\n  Of a boke which called is _Trophe_\r\n  In Lumbarde tong,' &c.\r\n\r\nNo book or author is now known by that name; and, as Chaucer was in this\r\ncase much indebted to Boccaccio, critics have jumped to the conclusion that\r\n_Trophee_ means either Boccaccio or the Filostrato; and this conclusion has\r\nbeen supported by arguments so hopeless as to need no repetition. But it is\r\nmost likely that Lydgate, who does not seem to have known any Italian[50],\r\nspoke somewhat casually; and, as Chaucer was to some extent indebted to\r\nGuido, he may possibly have meant Guido.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have merely stated a supposition which is, in itself, possible;\r\nbut I shall now adduce what I believe to be reasonable and solid proof of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe have yet another mention of _Trophee_, viz. in Chaucer himself! In the\r\nMonkes Tale, B 3307, he says of Hercules--\r\n\r\n 'At bothe the worldes endes, _seith Trophee_,\r\n  In stede of boundes, he a piler sette.'\r\n\r\nWhence, we may ask, is this taken? My answer is, _from Guido_.\r\n\r\n§ 11. If we examine the sources of the story of Hercules in the Monkes\r\nTale, we see that all the supposed facts _except_ the one mentioned in the\r\ntwo lines above quoted are taken from Boethius and Ovid (see the Notes).\r\nNow the next most obvious source of information was Guido's work, since the\r\nvery first Book has a good deal about Hercules, and the Legend of Hypsipyle\r\nclearly shews us that Chaucer was aware of this. And, although neither Ovid\r\n(in Met. ix.) nor Boethius has any allusion to the Pillars of Hercules,\r\nthey are expressly mentioned by Guido. In the English translation called\r\nthe Gest Historiale of the Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and Donaldson\r\n(which I call, for brevity, the alliterative Troy-book), l. 308, we read:--\r\n\r\n 'But the wonders that he wroght in this world here\r\n  In yche cuntré ben knowen under Criste evyn.\r\n  Tow pyllers he pight in a place lowe\r\n  Vppon Gades groundes, that he gotton had.'\r\n\r\nAnd again, further on, the Latin text has:--'Locus ille, in quo predicte\r\n_Herculis columpne_ sunt affixe, dicitur Saracenica lingua Saphy.' To which\r\nis added, that Alexander afterwards came to the same spot.\r\n\r\nWhen Lydgate, in translating Guido, comes to this passage, he says:--\r\n\r\n   'And of the pyllers that at Gades he set,\r\n  Which Alexsaundre, of Macedone the kyng,\r\n  That was so worthy here in his lyuynge,\r\n  Rood in his conquest, as _Guydo_ list to write,\r\n  With all his hoost proudely to visyte ...\r\n  And these boundes named be of all\r\n  Of Hercules, for he hymselfe theim set\r\n  As for his markes, all other for to lette\r\n  Ferther to passe, as _Guydo_ maketh mynde'; &c.\r\n                            Siege of Troye, ed. 1555, fol. B6.\r\n\r\nWe can now easily see that, when Lydgate speaks of the book 'which called\r\nis Trophe in Lumbarde tong,' he is simply copying the name of the book from\r\nChaucer, though he seems also to have heard some rumour of its being so\r\ncalled in Italy.\r\n\r\n§ 12. _Why_ this particular book was so called, we have no means of\r\nknowing[51]; but this does not invalidate the fact here pointed out. Of\r\ncourse the Latin side-note in some of the MSS. of the Monkes Tale, which\r\nexplains 'Trophee' as referring to 'ille vates Chaldeorum Tropheus,' must\r\nbe due to some mistake, even if it emanated (as is possible) from Chaucer\r\nhimself. It is probable that, when the former part of the Monkes Tale was\r\nwritten, Chaucer did not know much about Guido's work; for the account of\r\nHercules occurs in the very first chapter. Perhaps he confused the name of\r\nTropheus with that of Trogus, i.e. Pompeius Trogus the historian, whose\r\nwork is one of the authorities for the history of the Assyrian monarchy.\r\n\r\n§ 13. It remains for me to point out some of the passages in Troilus which\r\nare clearly due to Guido, and are not found in Boccaccio at all.\r\n\r\nBook I. 145-7:--\r\n\r\n 'But the Troyane gestes, as they felle,\r\n  In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dyte,\r\n  Who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte.'\r\n\r\nThe reference here is simply to Guido's history, whence, and not at first\r\nhand, both Chaucer and his readers could easily get the required\r\ninformation. Guido constantly refers to these authors; and, although he\r\nspeaks disrespectfully of Homer[52], he professes to put great faith in\r\nDares and Dytes, whose names he frequently cites as being those of his best\r\nauthorities[53].\r\n\r\nWith the description of Troilus in ll. 1072-1085, it is interesting to\r\ncompare the words of Guido, in Book VIII. 'Troilus vero, licet multum fuit\r\ncorpore magnus, magis fuit tamen corde magnanimus; animosus multum, set\r\nmultam habuit in sua animositate temperiem; dilectus plurimum a puellis cum\r\nipse aliqualem seruando modestiam delectaretur in illis. In viribus et\r\nstrenuitate bellandi _uel fuit alius Hector uel secundus ab ipso_. In toto\r\neciam regno Troie iuuenis nullus fuit tantis viribus nec tanta audacia\r\ngloriosus[54].' The latter part of this description should be compared with\r\nBook II. 157-161, where the very phrase 'Ector the secounde' is used; see\r\nalso ll. 181-189.\r\n\r\n§ 14. Book II. 618. 'The yate ... Of Dardanus.' The six gates of Troy are\r\nnamed in Guido, Book IV, 'Quarum vna _Dardanides_, secunda Tymbrea, tercia\r\nHelyas, quarta Chetas, quinta Troiana, vltima Anthenorides vocabantur.'\r\n\r\n 'The furst and the fairest fourmet was Dardan.'\r\n                                     Allit. Troy-book, l. 1557.\r\n\r\nLydgate keeps the form 'Dardanydes'; cap. xi. fol. F 5.\r\n\r\n§ 15. Book IV. 204. 'For he was after traytour to the toun.' The treason of\r\nAntenor is told by Guido at great length; see 'Boke xxviii' of the allit.\r\nTroy-book, p. 364; Lydgate, Siege of Troye, Y 6, back. Cf. Dictys\r\nCretensis, lib. iv. c. 22.\r\n\r\nBook IV. 1397, &c. 'For al Apollo and his clerkish lawes,' &c. Guido gives\r\nrather a long account of the manner in which Criseyde upbraided her father\r\nChalcas at their meeting. Chaucer says nothing about this matter in Book V.\r\n193, but he here introduces an account of the same speech, telling us that\r\nCreseyde _intended_ to make it! I quote from Book XIX. 'Sane deceperunt te\r\nApollinis friuola responsa, a quo dicis te suscepisse mandatum vt tu\r\npaternas Lares desereres, et tuos in tanta acerbitate Penates[55] sic tuis\r\nspecialiter hostibus adhereres. Sane non fuit ille deus Apollo, set, puto,\r\nfuit comitiua infernalium Furiarum a quibus responsa talia recepisti.' Cf.\r\nallit. Troy-book, 8103-40; and observe that Lydgate, in his Siege of Troye,\r\nR 3, back, omits the speech of Criseyde to her father, on the ground that\r\nit is given in Chaucer. Yet such is not the case, unless we allow the\r\npresent passage to stand for it. In Book V. 194, Chaucer (following\r\nBoccaccio) expressly says that she was _mute_!\r\n\r\nBook IV. 1695-1701. This last stanza is not in Boccaccio; but the general\r\nsense of it is in Guido, Book XIX, where the interview ends thus:--'Set\r\ndiei Aurora quasi superueniente uicina, Troilus a Brisaida in multis\r\nanxietatibus et doloribus discessit; et ea relicta ad sui palacii menia\r\nproperauit.' Lydgate, at this point, refers us to Chaucer; Siege of Troye,\r\nfol. R 2, back. The allit. Troy-book actually does the same; l. 8054.\r\n\r\n§ 16. Book V. 92-189. These fourteen stanzas are not in Boccaccio. The\r\ncorresponding passage in Guido (Book XIX) is as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Troilus et Troiani redeunt, Grecis eam recipientibus in suo commeatu.\r\nInter quos dum esset Diomedes, et illam Diomedes inspexit, statim in ardore\r\nveneris exarsit et eam vehementi desiderio concupiuit, qui collateralis\r\nassociando Brisaidam cum insimul equitarent, sui ardoris flammam continere\r\nnon valens Brisaide reuelat sui estuantis cordis amorem; quam in multis\r\naffectuosis verbis et blandiciis necnon et promissionibus reuera magnificis\r\nallicere satis humiliter est rogatus. Set Brisaida in primis monitis, vt\r\nmulierum moris est, suum prestare recusauit assensum; nec tamen passa est\r\nquin post multa Diomedis verba, ipsum nolens a spe sua deicere verbis\r\nsimilibus dixit ei: \"Amoris tui oblaciones ad presens nec repudio nec\r\nadmitto, cum cor meum non sit ad presens ita dispositum quod tibi possim\r\naliter respondere.\"'\r\n\r\nBook V. 799-805[56]. The description of Diomede in Boccaccio (Fil. VI. 33)\r\nis merely as follows:--\r\n\r\n 'Egli era grande e bel della persona,\r\n  Giovane fresco e piacevole assai,\r\n  E forte e fier siccome si ragiona,\r\n  E parlante quant'altro Greco mai,\r\n  E ad amor la natura aveva prona.'\r\n\r\nThe account in Guido (Book VIII) is as follows:--'Diomedes vero multa fuit\r\nproceritate, distensus amplo pectore, robustis scapulis, aspectu ferox; in\r\npromissis fallax; in armis strenuus; victorie cupidus; timendus a multis,\r\ncum multum esset iniuriosus; sermonibus sibi nimis impaciens, cum molestus\r\nseruientibus nimis esset; libidinosus quidem multum, et qui multas traxit\r\nangustias ob feruorem amoris.' Cf. allit. Troy-book, ll. 3794-3803;\r\nLydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. K 1, back.\r\n\r\nBook V. 810. To gon y-tressed, &c. Perhaps suggested by the remark in Guido\r\n(Book XIX) that Cressid's hair was unbound in her hour of deepest\r\nsorrow:--'aureos crines suos a lege ligaminis absolutos a lactea sui\r\ncapitis cute diuellit.' Cf. IV. 736.\r\n\r\nBook V. 827-840. Troilus is not described by Boccaccio. Guido's description\r\nof him has already been quoted above; see remarks on Book I. 1072; pp. lvi,\r\nlvii.\r\n\r\nBook V. 1002-4. The parallel passage in Guido has already been quoted,\r\nviz.: 'Amoris tui oblaciones ad presens nec repudio nec admitto.' See\r\nremarks on l. 92; p. lviii.\r\n\r\nBook V. 1013. Obviously from Guido; the passage follows soon after that\r\nlast quoted. 'Associauit [Diomedes] eam vsquequo Brisaida recipere in sui\r\npatris tentoria se debebat. Et ea perueniente ibidem, ipse eam ab equo\r\ndescendentem promptus adiuit, et vnam de cirothecis[57], quam Brisaida\r\ngerebat in manu, ab ea nullo percipiente furtiue subtraxit. Set cum ipsa\r\nsola presensit, placitum furtum dissimulauit amantis.'\r\n\r\nFor this incident of the glove, cf. allit. Troy-book, l. 8092.\r\n\r\nBook V. 1023-1099. This passage is not in Boccaccio. Several hints for it\r\nseem to have been taken from Guido, Book XIX, whence I quote the following.\r\n\r\n'Nondum dies illa ad horas declinauerat vespertinas, cum iam suas Brisaida\r\nrecentes mutauerat voluntates,' &c.. 'Et iam nobilis Troili amor ceperat in\r\nsua mente tepescere, et sic repente subito facta volubilis se in omnibus\r\nvariauit. Quid est ergo quod dicitur de constancia mulierum,' &c.\r\n\r\n'Tunc ilico Diomedes superuenit . . qui repente in Troilum irruit, ipsum ab\r\nequo prosternit, ab eo auferens equum suum, quem per suum nuncium specialem\r\nad Brisaidam in exennium[58] destinauit, mandans nuncio suo predicto vt\r\nBrisaide nunciet equum ipsum eius fuisse dilecti . . . . Brisaida vero\r\nequum Troili recepit hilariter, et ipsi nuncio refert hec verba: \"Dic\r\nsecure domino tuo quod ilium odio habere non possum, qui me tanta puritate\r\ncordis affectat . . . . [Diomedes] Brisaidam accedit, et eam suplex\r\nhortatur vt sibi consenciat in multitudine lacrimarum. Set illa, que multum\r\nvigebat sagacitatis astucia, Diomedem sagacibus machinacionibus differre\r\nprocurat, ut ipsum afflictum amoris incendio magis affligat, et eius amoris\r\nvehemenciam in maioris augmentum ardoris extollat. Vnde Diomedi suum amorem\r\nnon negat, etiam nec promittit.\"'\r\n\r\nIn l. 1039, read _he_, i. e. Diomede; see my note on the line, at p. 499.\r\n\r\nIn l. 1037, _the story_ means the Historia Troiana; and in l. 1044, _in the\r\nstories elles-where_ means 'elsewhere in the same History.' The passage (in\r\nBook XXV) is as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Troilus autem tunc amorem Brisaide Diomedi obprobriosis verbis improperat;\r\nset Greci Diomedem ... abstraxerunt' ...\r\n\r\n'Interim Brisaida contra patris sui voluntatem videre Diomedem in lecto suo\r\niacentem ex vulnere sibi facto frequenter accedit, et licet sciuisset illum\r\na Troilo dudum dilecto suo sic vulneratum, multa tamen in mente sua\r\nreuoluit; et dum diligenter attendit de se iungenda cum Troilo nullam sibi\r\nsuperesse fiduciam, totum suum animum, tanquam varia et mutabilis, sicut\r\nest proprium mulierum, in Diomedis declinat amorem.'\r\n\r\nCf. Troy-book, ll. 9942-59; Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. U 4.\r\n\r\nBook V. 1558-60. The treacherous slaughter of Hector by Achilles is in\r\nGuido, near the end of Book XXV. See my note to l. 1558, at p. 503.\r\n\r\nBook V. 1771. 'Read Dares.' This merely means that Guido cites Dares as his\r\nauthority for the mighty deeds of Troilus. In Book XXV, I find:--'_Scripsit\r\nenim Dares_, quod illo die _mille_ milites interfecit [Troilus] ex Grecis';\r\ncf. l. 1802 below. So in the allit. Troy-book, ll. 9877-9:--\r\n\r\n 'As _Dares_ of his dedis duly me tellus,\r\n  A thowsaund thro knightes throng he to dethe,\r\n  That day with his dynttes, of the derffe Grekes.'\r\n\r\nSo Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. U 3, back:--\r\n\r\n 'And, as _Dares_ wryteth specyally,\r\n  A thousand knightes this Troyan champyowne\r\n  That day hath slayne, rydyng vp and downe,\r\n  As myne auctour Guydo lyst endyte;\r\n  _Saue after hym_, I can no ferther wryte.'\r\n\r\nI. e. he only knew of Dares through the medium of Guido. In fact, Dares\r\n(capp. 29, 31, 32) has 'multos,' not 'mille.'\r\n\r\nBook V. 1849-1855. The introduction of this stanza is quite irrelevant,\r\nunless we remember that, in Guido, the story of Troy is completely mixed up\r\nwith invectives against idolatry. In Book X, there is a detailed account of\r\nthe heathen gods, the worship of which is attributed to the instigation of\r\nfiends. See the long account in the allit. Troy-book, ll. 4257-4531,\r\nconcluding with the revelation by Apollo to Calchas of the coming fall of\r\nTroy. Cf. Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. K 6. Of course, this notion of the\r\ninterference of the gods in the affairs of the Greeks and Trojans is\r\nultimately due to Homer.\r\n\r\n§ 17. With regard to the statement in Guido, that Achilles slew Hector\r\n_treacherously_, we must remember how much turns upon this assertion. His\r\nobject was to glorify the Trojans, the supposed ancestors of the Roman\r\nrace, and to depreciate the Greeks. The following passage from Guido, Book\r\nXXV, is too characteristic to be omitted. 'Set o Homere, qui in libris tuis\r\nAchillem tot laudibus, tot preconiis extulisti, _que probabilis racio_ te\r\ninduxit, vt Achillem tantis probitatis meritis vel titulis exultasses?'\r\nSuch was the general opinion about Homer in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n§ 18. This is not the place for a full consideration of the further\r\nquestion, as to the sources of information whence Boccaccio and Guido\r\nrespectively drew their stories. Nor is it profitable to search the\r\nsupposed works of Dares and Dictys for the passages to which Chaucer\r\nappears to refer; since he merely knew those authors by name, owing to\r\nGuido's frequent appeals to them. Nevertheless, it is interesting to find\r\nthat Guido was quite as innocent as were Chaucer and Lydgate of any\r\nknowledge of Dares and Dictys at first hand. He acquired his great\r\nreputation in the simplest possible way, by stealing the whole of his\r\n'History' bodily, from a French romance by Benoît de Sainte-More, entitled\r\n_Le Roman de Troie_, which has been well edited and discussed by Mons. A.\r\nJoly. Mons. Joly has shewn that the _Roman de Troie_ first appeared between\r\nthe years 1175 and 1185; and that Guido's _Historia Troiana_ is little more\r\nthan an adaptation of it, which was completed in the year 1287, without any\r\nacknowledgment as to its true source.\r\n\r\nBenoît frequently cites Dares (or Daires), and at the end of his poem, ll.\r\n30095-6, says:--\r\n\r\n 'Ce que dist Daires et Dithis\r\n  I avons si retreit et mis.'\r\n\r\nIn his Hist. of Eng. Literature (E. version, ii. 113), Ten Brink remarks\r\nthat, whilst Chaucer prefers to follow Guido rather than Benoît in his\r\nLegend of Good Women, he 'does the exact opposite to what he did in\r\nTroilus.' For this assertion I can find but little proof. It is hard to\r\nfind anything in Benoît's lengthy Romance which he may not have taken, much\r\nmore easily, from Guido. There are, however, just a few such points in Book\r\nV. 1037-1078. Thus, in l. 1038, Criseyde gives Diomede Troilus' horse; cf.\r\nBenoît, l. 15046--'lo cheval Vos presterai.' L. 1043 is from the same, ll.\r\n15102-4:--\r\n\r\n 'La destre manche de son braz\r\n  Bone et fresche de ciclaton\r\n  Li done en leu de gonfanon.'\r\n\r\nLl. 1051-7 answer to the same, beginning at l. 20233; and l. 1074 is from\r\nthe same, l. 20308:--'Dex donge bien à Troylus!' I doubt if there is much\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nFor some further account of the works ascribed to Dares Phrygius and Dictys\r\nCretensis, both duly edited among the 'Delphin Classics,' I must refer the\r\nreader to Smith's Classical Dictionary.\r\n\r\n§ 19. The whole question of the various early romances that relate to Troy\r\nis well considered in a work entitled 'Testi Inediti di Storia Trojana,\r\npreceduti da uno studio sulla Leggenda Trojana in Italia, per Egidio Gorra;\r\nTorino, 1887'; where various authorities are cited, and specimens of\r\nseveral texts are given. At p. 136 are given the very lines of Benoît's\r\n_Roman_ (ll. 795-6) where Guido found a reference to the columns of\r\nHercules:--\r\n\r\n 'Et les bonnes ilec ficha\r\n  Ou Alixandre les trova.'\r\n\r\nThis hint he has somewhat elaborated, probably because he took a personal\r\ninterest in 'columns,' on account of their reference to his own\r\nname--'delle Colonne.' I believe that the notion of Alexander finding\r\nHercules' Pillars is due to a rather large blunder in geography. Hercules\r\nset up his pillars 'at the end of the world,' viz. at the straits of\r\nGibraltar, whereas Alexander set up his at another 'end of the world,' viz.\r\nat the furthest point of India which he succeeded in reaching. So says his\r\nRomance; see Alexander and Dindimus, ed. Skeat, l. 1137; Wars of Alexander,\r\nl. 5063. The setting up of pillars as boundary-marks seems to have been\r\ncommon; cf. Vergil, Æn. xi. 262. Among the points noticed by Gorra, I may\r\nmention the following:--\r\n\r\n1. Some account (p. 7) of the Ephemeris Belli Troiani by Dictys Cretensis,\r\nwho, it was pretended, accompanied Idomeneus to the Trojan war. Achilles is\r\ndepicted in dark colours; he is treacherous towards Agamemnon; falls in\r\nlove with the Trojan princess, Polyxena; and slays Hector by a stratagem.\r\nIt appears to have been a work of invention, resting upon no Greek\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n2. Some account (p. 17) of the Historia de Excidio Troiae of Dares\r\nPhrygius, a work which (as was pretended) was discovered by Cornelius\r\nNepos. This also, in the opinion of most critics, was an original work. At\r\np. 115, there is a comparison of the lists of Greek leaders and the number\r\nof their ships (cf. Homer, Il. ii.) as given by Dares, Benoît, and Guido.\r\n\r\n3. At p. 123, there is an enumeration of points in which Guido varies from\r\nBenoît.\r\n\r\n4. At p. 152, is an account of some Italian prose versions of the story of\r\nTroy. Such are: La Istorietta Trojana, with extracts from it at p. 371; a\r\nromance by Binduccio dello Scelto, with extracts relating to 'Troilo e\r\nBriseida' at p. 404; a version of Guido by Mazzeo Bellebuoni, with extracts\r\nrelating to 'Paride ed Elena' at p. 443; an anonymous version, with\r\nextracts relating to 'Giasone e Medea' at p. 458; a version in the Venetian\r\ndialect, with extracts relating to 'Ettore ed Ercole' at p. 481; another\r\nanonymous version, with extracts at p. 493; and La 'Fiorita' of Armannino,\r\nGiudice da Bologna, with extracts at p. 532.\r\n\r\n5. At p. 265, is an account of Italian poetical versions, viz. Enfances\r\nHector, Poema d'Achille, Il Trojano di Domenico da Montechiello, Il Trojano\r\na stampa (i.e. a printed edition of Il Trojano), and L'Intelligenza. At p.\r\n336, Boccaccio's Filostrato is discussed; followed by a brief notice of an\r\nanonymous poem, also in ottava rima, called Il cantare di Insidoria. It\r\nappears that Boccaccio followed some recension of the French text of\r\nBenoît, but much of the work is his own invention. In particular, he\r\ncreated the character of Pandaro, who resembles a Neapolitan courtier of\r\nhis own period.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the extracts given by Gorra are those from\r\nBinduccio dello Scelto; at p. 411, we have the incident of Diomede\r\npossessing himself of Briseida's glove, followed by the interview between\r\nBriseida and her father Calcas. At p. 413, Diomede overthrows Troilus,\r\ntakes his horse from him and sends it to Briseida, who receives it\r\ngraciously; and at p. 417, Briseida gives Diomede her sleeve as a\r\nlove-token, after which a 'jousting' takes place between Diomede and\r\nTroilus, in which the former is badly wounded.\r\n\r\nFor further remarks, we are referred, in particular, to H. Dunger's\r\nDictys-Septimius: über die ursprüngliche Abfassung und die Quellen der\r\nEphemeris belli Troiani; Dresden, 1878 (Programm des Vitzthumschen\r\nGymnasiums); to another essay by the same author on Die Sage vom\r\ntrojanischen Kriege, Leipzig, 1869; to Koerting's Dictys und Dares, &c.,\r\nHalle, 1874; to A. Joly's Benoît de Sainte-More et le Roman de Troie,\r\nParis, 1871; and to an article by C. Wagener on Dares Phrygius, in\r\n_Philologus_, vol. xxxviii. The student may also consult E. Meybrinck, Die\r\nAuffassung der Antike bei Jacques Millet, Guido de Columna, und Benoît de\r\nSte-More, printed in Ausgaben und Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiete für\r\nRomanischen Philologie, Marburg, 1886; where the author concludes that\r\nMillet was the originator of the story in France. Also W. Greif, Die\r\nmittelalterlichen Bearbeitungen der Trojanersage; Marburg, 1886.\r\n\r\n§ 20. A few words may be said as to the names of the characters. Troilus is\r\nonly once mentioned in Homer, where he is said to be one of the sons of\r\nPriam, who were slain in battle, Iliad, xxiv. 257; so that his story is of\r\nmedieval invention, except as to the circumstance of his slayer being\r\nAchilles, as stated by Vergil, Æn. i. 474, 475; cf. Horace, Carm. ii. 9.\r\n16. Pandarus occurs as the name of two distinct personages; (1) a Lycian\r\narcher, who wounded Menelaus; see Homer, Il. iv. 88, Vergil, Æn. 5. 496;\r\nand (2) a companion of Æneas, slain by Turnus; see Vergil, Æn. ix. 672, xi.\r\n396. Diomede is a well-known hero in the Iliad, but his love-story is of\r\nlate invention. The heroine of Benoît's poem is Briseida, of whom Dares (c.\r\n13) has merely the following brief account: 'Briseidam formosam, alta\r\nstatura, candidam, capillo flauo et molli, superciliis junctis[59], oculis\r\nvenustis, corpore aequali, blandam, affabilem, uerecundam, animo simplici,\r\npiam'; but he records nothing more about her. The name is simply copied\r\nfrom Homer's [Greek: Brisêida], Il. i. 184, the accusative being taken (as\r\noften) as a new nominative case; this Briseis was the captive assigned to\r\nAchilles. But Boccaccio substitutes for this the form Griseida, taken from\r\nthe accusative of Homer's Chryseis, mentioned just two lines above, Il. i.\r\n182. For this Italian form Chaucer substituted Criseyde, a trisyllabic\r\nform, with the _ey_ pronounced as the _ey_ in _prey_. He probably was led\r\nto this correction by observing the form Chryseida in his favourite author,\r\nOvid; see Remed. Amoris, 469. Calchas, in Homer, Il. i. 69, is a Grecian\r\npriest; but in the later story he becomes a Trojan soothsayer, who,\r\nforeseeing the destruction of Troy, secedes to the Greek side, and is\r\nlooked upon as a traitor. Cf. Vergil, Æn. ii. 176; Ovid, Art. Amat. ii.\r\n737.\r\n\r\n§ 21. In Anglia, xiv. 241, there is a useful comparison, by Dr. E. Köppel,\r\nof the parallel passages in Troilus and the French Roman de la Rose, ed.\r\nMéon, Paris, 1814, which I shall denote by 'R.' These are mostly pointed\r\nout in the Notes. Köppel's list is as follows:--\r\n\r\nTroilus. I. 635 (cf. III. 328).--Rom. Rose, 8041. 637.--R. 21819. 747.--R.\r\n7595. 810.--R. 21145. 969--R. 12964.\r\n\r\nII. 167.--R. 5684. 193.--R. 8757. 716.--R. 5765. 754.--R. 6676. 784 (cf.\r\nIII. 1035).--R. 12844. 1564.--R. 18498.\r\n\r\nIII. 294.--R. 7085. 328; _see_ I. 635. 1035; _see_ II. 784. 1634.--R. 8301.\r\n\r\nIV. 7.--R. 8076. 519.--R. 6406. 1398.--R. 6941.\r\n\r\nV. 365.--R. 18709.\r\n\r\nSome of the resemblances are but slight; but others are obvious. The\r\nnumbers refer to the beginning of a passage; sometimes the really\r\ncoincident lines are found a little further on.\r\n\r\nThe parallel passages common to Troilus and Boethius are noted above, pp.\r\nxxviii-xxx.\r\n\r\nAn excellent and exhaustive treatise on the Language of Chaucer's Troilus,\r\nby Prof. Kitteredge, is now (1893) being printed for the Chaucer Society. A\r\nRyme-Index to the same, compiled by myself, has been published for the same\r\nsociety, dated 1891.\r\n\r\n§ 22. I have frequently alluded above to the alliterative 'Troy-book,' or\r\n'Gest Historiale,' edited for the Early English Text Society, in 1869-74,\r\nby Panton and Donaldson. This is useful for reference, as being a tolerably\r\nclose translation of Guido, although a little imperfect, owing to the loss\r\nof some leaves and some slight omissions (probably) on the part of the\r\nscribe. It is divided into 36 Books, which agree, very nearly, with the\r\nBooks into which the original text is divided. The most important passages\r\nfor comparison with Troilus are lines 3922-34 (description of Troilus);\r\n3794-3803 (Diomede); 7268-89 (fight between Troilus and Diomede); 7886-7905\r\n(Briseida and her dismissal from Troy); 8026-8181 (sorrow of Troilus and\r\nBriseida, her departure, and the interviews between Briseida and Diomede,\r\nand between her and Calchas her father); 8296-8317 (Diomede captures\r\nTroilus' horse, and presents it to Briseida); 8643-60 (death of Hector);\r\n9671-7, 9864-82, 9926-9 (deeds of Troilus); 9942-59 (Briseida visits the\r\nwounded Diomede); 10055-85, 10252-10311 (deeds of Troilus, and his death);\r\n10312-62 (reproof of Homer for his false statements).\r\n\r\nAt l. 8053, we have this remarkable allusion; speaking of Briseida and\r\nTroilus, the translator says:--\r\n\r\n 'Who-so wilnes to wit of thaire wo fir [futher],\r\n  Turne hym to TROILUS, and talke[60] there ynoughe!'\r\n\r\nI.e. whoever wishes to know more about their wo, let him turn to TROILUS,\r\nand there find enough. This is a clear allusion to Chaucer's work by its\r\nname, and helps to date the translation as being later than 1380 or 1382.\r\nAnd, as the translator makes no allusion to Lydgate's translation of Guido,\r\nthe date of which is 1412-20, we see that he probably wrote between 1382\r\nand 1420[61]; so that the date 'about 1400,' adopted in the New Eng.\r\nDictionary (s. v. _Bercelet_, &c.) cannot be far wrong[62].\r\n\r\n§ 23. Another useful book, frequently mentioned above, is Lydgate's Siege\r\nof Troye[61], of which I possess a copy printed in 1555. This contains\r\nseveral allusions to Chaucer's Troilus, and more than one passage in praise\r\nof Chaucer's poetical powers, two of which are quoted in Mr. Rossetti's\r\nremarks on MS. Harl. 3943 (Chaucer Soc. 1875), pp. x, xi. These passages\r\nare not very helpful, though it is curious to observe that he speaks of\r\nChaucer not only as 'my maister Chaucer,' but as 'noble Galfride, chefe\r\nPoete of Brytaine,' and 'my maister Galfride.' The most notable passages\r\noccur in cap. xv, fol. K 2; cap. xxv, fol. R 2, back; and near the end,\r\nfol. Ee 2. Lydgate's translation is much more free than the preceding one,\r\nand he frequently interpolates long passages, besides borrowing a large\r\nnumber of poetical expressions from his 'maister.'\r\n\r\n§ 24. Finally, I must not omit to mention the remarkable poem by Robert\r\nHenrysoun, called the Testament and Complaint of Criseyde, which forms a\r\nsequel to Chaucer's story. Thynne actually printed this, in his edition of\r\n1532, as one of Chaucer's poems, immediately after Troilus; and all the\r\nblack-letter editions follow suit. Yet the 9th and 10th stanzas contain\r\nthese words, according to the edition of 1532:--\r\n\r\n 'Of his distresse me nedeth nat reherse;\r\n  For worthy Chaucer, in that same boke,\r\n  In goodly termes, and in ioly verse,\r\n  Compyled hath his cares, who wyl loke.\r\n  To breke my slepe, another queare I toke,\r\n  In whiche I founde the fatal desteny\r\n  Of fayre Creseyde, whiche ended wretchedly.\r\n\r\n  Who wot if al that Chaucer wrate was trewe?\r\n  Nor I wotte nat if this narration\r\n  Be authorysed, or forged of the newe\r\n  Of some poete by his inuention,\r\n  Made to reporte the lamentation\r\n  And woful ende of this lusty Creseyde,\r\n  And what distresse she was in or she deyde.'\r\n\r\n§ 25. THE MANUSCRIPTS.\r\n\r\n1. MS. CL.--The Campsall MS., on vellum, written before 1413; prepared for\r\nHenry, Prince of Wales, afterwards Henry V, as shewn by his arms on leaf 2.\r\nThe poem occupies leaves 2-120; each page usually contains five stanzas.\r\nTwo pages have been reproduced by the autotype process for the Chaucer\r\nSociety; viz. leaf 1, recto, containing stanzas 1-5, and leaf 42, verso,\r\ncontaining stanzas 249-251 of Book II, and stanza 1 of Book III. This is a\r\nbeautifully written MS., and one of the best; but it is disappointing to\r\nfind that it might easily have been much better. The scribe had a still\r\nbetter copy before him, which he has frequently treated with supreme\r\ncarelessness; but it is some consolation to find that his mistakes are so\r\nobvious that they can easily be corrected. Thus, in Book I, l. 27, he\r\nwrites _dorst_ for _dorste_, though it ruins the grammar and the metre; in\r\nl. 31, he actually has _hym_ for _hem_, to the destruction of the sense; in\r\nl. 69, he has _high_ (!) for _highte_; and so on. It therefore requires\r\ncareful control. In particular, the scribe gives many examples of the fault\r\nof 'anticipation,' i.e. the fault whereby the mind, swifter than the pen,\r\nhas induced him to write down letters that belong to a _later_ syllable or\r\nword, or to omit one or more letters. Thus in Book I. l. 80, he omits _u_\r\nin _pryuely_, writing _pryely_; in l. 126, he omits _and_ before _hoom_; in\r\nl. 198, he omits _lewede_; in l. 275, he omits _gan_; &c. But the faults of\r\n'anticipation' appear most clearly in such startling forms as _addermost_\r\nfor _aldermost_, I. 248, where the former _d_ is due to the one that is\r\ncoming; _assent_ for _absent_, IV. 1642, for a like reason; _estal_ for\r\n_estat_, because the next word is _royal_, I. 432; _þyn_ for _þyng_,\r\nbecause the next word is _myn_, I. 683; _nat_ for _nas_, because the next\r\nword is _not_, I. 738; _seynt_ for _seyn_, because the next word is _that_,\r\nV. 369; _shad_ for _shal_, because the next word is _drede_, V. 385;\r\n_liten_ for _litel_, because _weten_ follows, IV. 198; _make_ for _may_,\r\nbecause the line ends with _wake_, III. 341; _fleld_ for _feld_, II. 195.\r\nSometimes, however, the scribe's mind reverts to something already written,\r\nso that we find _Delphebus_ for _Delphicus_, because _Phebus_ precedes, I.\r\n70; _bothen_ for _bothe_, because _deden_ precedes, I. 82; _falles_ for\r\n_fallen_, after _unhappes_, II. 456; _daunder_ for _daunger_, III. 1321;\r\n_tolle_ for _tolde_, III 802; &c. Downright blunders are not uncommon; as\r\n_incocent_ for _innocent_ (where again the former _c_ is due to the\r\nlatter), II. 1723; _agarst_ for _agast_, III. 737; _right_ for _rit_, V.\r\n60. We even find startling variations in the reading, as in III. 1408:--\r\n\r\n 'Reson wil not that I speke of _shep_,\r\n  For it accordeth nough[t] to my matere.'\r\n\r\nCertainly, _shep_ (sheep) is irrelevant enough; however, Chaucer refers to\r\n_sleep_. And again, the line in II. 1554, which should run--\r\n\r\n  As for to bidde a wood man for to renne\r\n\r\nappears in the startling form--\r\n\r\n  As for to bydde a womman for to renne.\r\n\r\nAs all the variations of 'Cl.' from the correct text are given in the\r\nfoot-notes, it is not necessary to say more about these peculiarities. I\r\nmust add, however, that, as in Boethius, I have silently corrected _yn_ to\r\n_in_ in such words as _thing_; besides altering _ee_ and _oo_ to _e_ and\r\n_o_ in open syllables, writing _v_ for _u_, and the like. See above.\r\n\r\nThe Campsall MS., now in the possession of Mr. Bacon Frank, has been\r\nprinted in full, as written, for the Chaucer Society; and I have relied\r\nupon the accuracy of this well-edited print.\r\n\r\n2. MS. CP.--MS. No. 61 in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, described in\r\nNasmith's Catalogue, p. 40, as 'a parchment book in folio neatly written,\r\nand ornamented with a frontispiece richly illuminated, containing Chaucer's\r\nTroilus, in four [_error for_ five] books.' It is a fine folio MS., 12\r\ninches by 8½. This MS., noticed by Warton, has not as yet been printed,\r\nthough the Chaucer Society have undertaken to print it, upon my\r\nrecommendation. It contains many pages that are left wholly or partially\r\nblank, obviously meant to be supplied with illuminations; which shews that\r\nit was written for some wealthy person. On the left margin, near the 83rd\r\nstanza of Book IV, is a note of ownership, in a hand of the fifteenth\r\ncentury--'neu_er_ foryeteth: Anne neuyll.' This probably refers to Anne\r\nNeville, wife of Humphrey, duke of Buckingham (who was killed at\r\nNorthampton in 1460), and daughter of Ralph Neville, earl of Westmoreland,\r\nand of Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt. That is, she was John of\r\nGaunt's granddaughter; and it seems reasonable to infer that the MS. was\r\nactually written for one of John of Gaunt's family. This probability is a\r\nvery interesting one, when we consider how much Chaucer owed to John of\r\nGaunt's favour and protection.\r\n\r\nThe MS. is slightly deficient, owing to the omission of a few stanzas; but\r\nnot much is missing. It is of a type closely resembling the preceding, and\r\ngives excellent readings. I have therefore taken the opportunity of\r\nfounding the text upon a close collation of Cl. and Cp., taking Cl. as the\r\nfoundation, but correcting it by Cp. throughout, without specifying more\r\nthan the rejected reading of Cl. in passages where these MSS. differ. In\r\nthis way the numerous absurdities of Cl. (as noted above) have been easily\r\ncorrected, and the resulting text is a great improvement upon all that have\r\nhitherto appeared. In a few places, as shewn by the foot-notes, the\r\nreadings of other MSS. have been preferred.\r\n\r\n3. MS. H.--MS. Harl. 2280, in the British Museum. An excellent MS., very\r\nclosely related to both the preceding. Printed in full for the Chaucer\r\nSociety, and collated throughout in the present edition. It was taken as\r\nthe basis of the text in Morris's Aldine edition, which in many passages\r\nclosely resembles the present text. It is certainly the third best MS. One\r\nleaf is missing (Bk. V. 1345-1428; twelve stanzas).\r\n\r\n4. MS. CM.--MS. Gg. 4. 27, in the Cambridge University Library; the same\r\nMS. as that denoted by 'Cm.' in the foot-notes to the Canterbury Tales, and\r\nby 'C.' in the foot-notes to the Legend of Good Women. A remarkable MS.,\r\nprinted in full for the Chaucer Society. It exhibits _a different type_ of\r\ntext from that found in Cl., Cp., and H. The most noteworthy differences\r\nare as follows. In Bk. ii. 734, 5, this MS. has quite a different couplet,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n  Men louyn women þ_our_ al þis tou_n_ aboute;\r\n  Be þey þe wers? whi, nay, w_i_t_h_-outyn doute.\r\n\r\nBk. ii. 792 runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  How ofte tyme may men rede and se.\r\n\r\nBk. iv. 309-15 (stanza 45) runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  What shulde ye don but, for myn disconfort,\r\n  Stondyn for nought, and wepyn out youre ye?\r\n  Syn sche is queynt that wont was yow disport[63],\r\n  In vayn from this forth have I seyn twye;\r\n  For[64] medycyn youre vertu is a-weye;\r\n  O crewel eyen, sythyn that youre dispyt\r\n  Was al to sen Crisseydes eyen bryght.\r\n\r\nBk. iv. 638 runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  Pandare answerde, of that be as be may.\r\n\r\nAfter Bk. iv. 735, MS. Cm. introduces the following stanza, which, in the\r\npresent text, appears a little later (ll. 750-6) in a slightly altered\r\nform.\r\n\r\n  The salte teris fro_m_ hyre ey[gh]yn tweyn\r\n  Out ran, as scho_ur_ of aprille, ful swythe;\r\n  Hyre white brest sche bet, and for the peyne,\r\n  Aftyr the deth cryede a thousent sithe,\r\n  Syn he that wonyt was hir wo for to lythe,\r\n  Sche mot forgon; for which disauenture\r\n  Sche held hire-selue a for-lost creature.\r\n\r\nBk. iv. 806-33 (four stanzas) are omitted; so also are the 18 stanzas\r\nreferring to Free-Will, viz. Bk. iv. 953-1078. Bk. v. 230-1 runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  To whom for eu_er_emor myn herte is holde:\r\n  And thus he pleynyd, and ferth_er_e-more he tolde.\r\n\r\nWe cannot believe that Bk. iv. 309-15, as here given, can be genuine[65];\r\nbut it seems possible that some of the other readings may be so. The\r\nstanza, Bk. iv. 750-6, as here given, seems to represent the first draft of\r\nthese lines, which were afterwards altered to the form in which they appear\r\nin the text, whilst at the same time the stanza was shifted down. However,\r\nthis is mere speculation; and it must be confessed that, in many places,\r\nthis MS. is strangely corrupted. Several stanzas have only six lines\r\ninstead of seven, and readings occur which set all ideas of rime at\r\ndefiance. Thus, in I. 1260, _paste_ (riming with _caste_) appears as\r\n_passede_; in I. 1253, _ryde_ (riming with _aspyde_) appears as _rydende_;\r\nin III. 351, _hayes_ (riming with _May is_) appears as _halis_; &c.\r\n\r\nYet the MS. is worth collating, as it gives, occasionally, some excellent\r\nreadings. For example, in Bk. i. 143, it preserves the word _here_, which\r\nother MSS. wrongly omit; and, in the very next line, rightly has _to longe\r\ndwelle_, not _to longe to dwelle_.\r\n\r\nThe MS. has been, at some time, shamefully maltreated by some one who has\r\ncut out several leaves, no doubt for the sake of their illuminated\r\ninitials. Hence the following passages do not appear: I. 1-70; I. 1037--II.\r\n84; III. 1-56; III. 1807--IV. 112; IV. 1667--V. 35; V. 1702--_end_\r\n(_together with a piece at the beginning of the_ Canterbury Tales).\r\n\r\n5. MS. H2.--Harleian MS. 3943, in the British Museum. Printed in full for\r\nthe Chaucer Society in 1875, together with a most valuable line by line\r\ncollation with Boccaccio's Filostrato, by Wm. Michael Rossetti. Referred to\r\nin Prof. Lounsbury's Studies in Chaucer, i. 398, as 'much the worst that\r\nhas been printed,' where his object is to depreciate its authority. Yet it\r\nis well worth a careful study, and it must be particularly borne in mind\r\nthat it consists of two parts, written at different dates, and of different\r\nvalue. In Bell's Chaucer, we read of it:--'Unfortunately it is imperfect.\r\nThe first few leaves, and the whole of the latter part of the poem, appear\r\nto have been destroyed, and the deficiency supplied by a later copyist.'\r\nThe late hand occurs in I. 1-70, 498-567, III. 1429-1638, IV. 197--_end_,\r\nand Book V.; and thus occupies a large portion of the MS. Moreover, two\r\nleaves are lost after leaf 59, comprising III. 1289-1428; these are\r\nsupplied in Dr. Furnivall's edition from Harl. 1239, which accounts for the\r\nextraordinary disorder in which these stanzas are arranged. The MS. also\r\nomits III. 1744-1771, and some other stanzas occasionally.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those curious MSS. which, although presenting innumerable\r\ncorrupt readings (the worst being _Commodious_ for _Commeveden_ in III.\r\n17), nevertheless have some points of contact with an excellent source. All\r\neditors must have observed a few such cases. Thus, in II. 615, it happily\r\nrestores the right reading _latis_, where the ordinary reading _gates_ is\r\nludicrously wrong. In III. 49, it supplies the missing word _gladnes_. In\r\nV. 8, it has 'The Auricomus tressed Phebus hie on lofte,' instead of 'The\r\ngolden tressed'; and this reading, though false, lets us into the secret of\r\nthe origin of this epithet, viz. that it translates the Latin _auricomus_;\r\nsee note to the line. In the very next line, V. 9, it preserves the correct\r\nreading _bemes shene_[66], riming with _grene_, _quene_, where other MSS.\r\nhave _bemes clere_, a reminiscence of the opening line of Book III. Hence I\r\nhave carefully collated this MS., and all readings of value are given in\r\nthe Notes. See, e. g. III. 28, 49, 136, 551, 1268, 1703, &c.\r\n\r\n6. MS. Harl. 1239 (B. M.). 'It is an oblong folio, written from the\r\nbeginning in a small, clear character, which ceases at an earlier place\r\n[III. 231] than the change occurs in MS. 3943 [IV. 197], leaving the\r\nremainder comparatively useless as an authority.'--Bell. Dr. Furnivall has\r\nprinted the passages in III. 1289-1428, and III. 1744-1771, from this MS.\r\nto supply the gaps in H 2 (see above); we thus see that it transposes\r\nseveral of the stanzas, and is but a poor authority.\r\n\r\n7. MS. Harl. 2392 (B. M.).  A late MS. on paper, not very correct; once the\r\nproperty of Sir H. Spelman. As an example of a strange reading, observe 'O\r\nmortal Gower,' in V. 1856. Still, it has the correct reading _sheene_ in V.\r\n9; and in III. 49, supplies the rare reading _gladnesse_, which is\r\nnecessary to the sense.\r\n\r\nThis MS. has a large number of notes and glosses. Some are of small\r\ninterest, but others are of value, and doubtless proceeded from the author\r\nhimself, as they furnish useful references and explanations. I here notice\r\nthe best of them.\r\n\r\nII. 8. 'Cleo: domina eloquencie.' This view of Clio explains the context.\r\n\r\nII. 784. Side-note: 'nota mendacium.' A remarkable comment.\r\n\r\nII. 1238-9. 'Leuis impressio, leuis recessio.' Clearly, a proverb.\r\n\r\nIII. 933. 'Dulcarnon: i. fuga miserorum.'

'Vnbodye: decorporare.'\r\n\r\nThere are many more such glosses, of lesser interest.\r\n\r\n8. MS. Harl. 4912 (B. M.). On vellum; rather large pages, with wide\r\nmargins; five stanzas on the page. Imperfect; ends at IV. 686. A poor copy.\r\nIn III. 49, it retains the rare reading 'gladnes,' but miswritten as\r\n'glanes.'\r\n\r\n9. MS. Addit. 12044 (B. M.). On vellum; five stanzas to the page. Last leaf\r\ngone; ends at V. 1820. Not a good copy. In III. 17, it has 'Comeued hem,'\r\nan obvious error for 'Comeueden,' which is the true reading. In V. 8, it\r\nhas 'golden dressed,' error for 'golden tressed.' Note this correct form\r\n'golden'; for it is miswritten as 'gold' or 'golde' in nearly all other\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\nThe next four are in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.\r\n\r\n10. Arch. Seld. B. 24 is the Scottish MS., dated 1472, described in the\r\nIntroduction to the Minor Poems, where it is denoted by 'Ar.,' and fully\r\ncollated throughout the Legend of Good Women, where it appears in the\r\nfoot-notes as 'A.' It seems to be the best of the Oxford MSS., and has some\r\ngood readings. In III. 17, it has 'Co_m_meued tham' for Commeueden,' which\r\nis near enough for a MS. that so freely drops inflexions; and the line ends\r\nwith 'and amoreux tham made.' In III. 49, it correctly preserves\r\n'gladness.'\r\n\r\n11. MS. Rawlinson, Poet. 163. Not a very good copy. It omits the Prologue\r\nto Book III. At the end is the colophon:--\r\n\r\n              { Heer endith the book of }\r\n 'Tregentyll {                         } Chaucer.'\r\n              { Troylus and of Cresseyde}\r\n\r\nI take 'Tregentyll' to be the scribe's name[67]. Besides the 'Troilus,' the\r\nMS. contains, on a fly-leaf, the unique copy of the Balade to Rosemounde,\r\nbeneath which is written (as in the former case) 'tregentil' to the left of\r\nthe page, and 'chaucer' to the right; connected by a thin stroke. See my\r\n'Twelve Facsimiles of Old English MSS.'; Plate XII.\r\n\r\n12. MS. Arch. Seld. supra 56. Small quarto, 8 inches by 5½, on paper;\r\nvellum binding; writing clear. A poor copy. The grammar shews a Northern\r\ndialect.\r\n\r\n13. MS. Digby 181. Incomplete; nearly half being lost. It ends at III.\r\n532--'A certayn houre in which she come sholde.' A poor copy, closely\r\nallied to the preceding. Thus, in III. 17, both have _moreux_ for\r\n_amoreux_; in III. 2, both have _Adornes_; in III. 6, both absurdly have\r\n_Off_ (_Of_) for _O_; and so on.\r\n\r\n14. MS. L. 1, in St. John's College, Cambridge. A fair MS., perhaps earlier\r\nthan 1450. Subjoined to the Troilus is a sixteenth century copy of the\r\nTestament of Creseide. Quarto; on vellum; 10 inches by 6½; in 10 sheets of\r\n12 leaves each. Leaf g 12 is cut out, and g 11 is blank, but nothing seems\r\nto be lost. It frequently agrees with Cp., as in I. 5, fro ye; 21, be this;\r\n36, desespeyred; 45, fair ladys so; 70, Delphicus; 308, kan thus. In I.\r\n272, it correctly has: p_er_cede; in 337, nou_n_c_er_teyne. In II. 734, it\r\nagrees with H.; 735 runs--'And whan hem list no lenger, lat hem leue'; a\r\ngood line. In II. 894, it has 'mosten axe,' the very reading which I give;\r\nand in II. 968, stalkes.\r\n\r\n15. MS. Phillipps 8252; the same MS. as that described in my preface to the\r\nC. text of Piers the Plowman, p. xix, where it is numbered XXVIII.\r\n\r\n16. A MS. in the Library of Durham Cathedral, marked V. ii. 13. A single\r\nstanza of Troilus, viz. I. 631-7, occurs in MS. R. 3. 20, in Trinity\r\nCollege Library, Cambridge; and three stanzas, viz. III. 302-322, in MS.\r\nFf. 1. 6, leaf 150, in the Cambridge University Library; all printed in Odd\r\nTexts of Chaucer's Minor Poems, ed. F. J. Furnivall, Chaucer Society, 1880,\r\npp. x-xii. In 1887, Dr. Stephens found two vellum strips in the cover of a\r\nbook, containing fragments of a MS. of Troilus (Book V. 1443-1498); see\r\nAppendix to the Report of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, May 24, 1887;\r\npp. 331-5.\r\n\r\nThe MSS. fall, as far as I can tell, into two main families. The larger\r\nfamily is that which resembles Cl., Cp., and H. Of the smaller, Cm. may be\r\ntaken as the type. The description of Cm. shews some of the chief\r\nvariations. Observe that many MSS. omit I. 890-6; in the John's MS., it is\r\ninserted in a much later hand. The stanza is obviously genuine.\r\n\r\n§ 26. THE EDITIONS. 'Troilus' was first printed by Caxton, about 1484; but\r\nwithout printer's name, place, or date. See the description in Blades' Life\r\nof Caxton, p. 297. There is no title-page. Each page contains five stanzas.\r\nTwo copies are in the British Museum; one at St. John's College, Oxford;\r\nand one (till lately) was at Althorp. The second edition is by Wynkyn de\r\nWorde, in 1517. The third, by Pynson, in 1526. These three editions present\r\nTroilus as a separate work. After this, it was included in Thynne's edition\r\nof 1532, and in all the subsequent editions of Chaucer's Works.\r\n\r\nOf these, the only editions accessible to me have been Thynne's (1532), of\r\nwhich there is a copy in the Cambridge University Library; also the\r\neditions of 1550 (or thereabouts) and 1561, of both of which I possess\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\nThynne's edition was printed from so good a MS. as to render it an\r\nexcellent authority. In a few places, I fear he has altered the text for\r\nthe worse, and his errors have been carefully followed and preserved by\r\nsucceeding editors. Thus he is responsible for altering _io_ (= _jo_) into\r\n_go_, III. 33; for creating the remarkable 'ghost-word' _gofysshe_, III.\r\n584; and a few similar curiosities. But I found it worth while to collate\r\nit throughout; and readings from it are marked 'Ed.' The later black-letter\r\ncopies are mere reproductions of it.\r\n\r\n§ 27. THE PRESENT EDITION. The present edition has the great advantage of\r\nbeing founded upon Cl. and Cp., neither of which have been previously made\r\nuse of, though they are the two best. Bell's text is founded upon the\r\nHarleian MSS. numbered 1239, 2280, and 3943, in separate fragments; hence\r\nthe text is neither uniform nor very good. Morris's text is much better,\r\nbeing founded upon H. (closely related to Cl. and Cp.), with a few\r\ncorrections from other unnamed sources.\r\n\r\nThanks to the prints provided by the Chaucer Society, I have been able to\r\nproduce a text which, I trust, leaves but little to be desired. I point out\r\nsome of the passages which now appear in a correct form for the first time,\r\nas may be seen by comparison with the editions by Morris and Bell, which I\r\ndenote by M. and B.\r\n\r\nI. 136; _derre_, dearer; M. B. dere (no rime). 285. _meninge_, i. e.\r\nintention; _and so in_ l. 289; M. B. mevynge. 388. M. B. insert a semicolon\r\nafter _arten_. 465. _fownes_ (see note);  M. B. fantasye (line too long).\r\n470 _felle_, fell, pl. adj.; M. B. fille, i. e. fell (verb). 590. _no\r\ncomfort_; M. comfort; B. eny comfort. 786. _Ticius_ (see note); M.\r\nSyciphus; B. Siciphus. 896. _Thee oughte_; M. To oght (no sense); B. The\r\noght (will not scan). 1026. See note; put as a question in M. B.; B. even\r\ninserts _not_ before _to done_. 1050. _me asterte_; M. may sterte; B. me\r\nstert (better).\r\n\r\nII. 41. _seyde_, i. e. if that they seyde; M. B. seyinge (will not scan).\r\n138. _were_ (would there be); M. B. is. 180. _wight_; M. B. knyght (but see\r\nl. 177). 808. _looth_; M. B. leve. 834. _Ye_; M. B. The. 1596. _For for_;\r\nM. B. For.\r\n\r\nIII. 17. _Comeveden_ (see note); M. Comeneden; B. Commodious. _him_; M. B.\r\nhem. 33. _io_ (= _jo_); M. B. go. 49. M. B. omit _gladnes_. 572. _Yow\r\nthurfte_; M. Thow thruste; B. Yow durst. 584. _goosish_; M. goofish; B.\r\ngofisshe. 674. M. Thei voide [_present_], dronke [_past_], and traveres\r\ndrawe [_present_] anon; B. They voyded, and drunk, and travars drew anone.\r\nReally, _dronke_ and _drawe_ are both past participles; see note. 725.\r\n_Cipris_; M. Cyphes; B. Ciphis. 1231. _Bitrent and wryth_, i. e. winds\r\nabout and wreathes itself; M. Bytrent and writhe is; B. Bitrent and writhen\r\nis. _Wryth_ is short for _writheth_; not a pp. 1453. _bore_, i. e. hole; M.\r\nboure; B. bowre. 1764. _to-hepe_, i. e. together; M. B. to kepe.\r\n\r\nIV. 538. _kyth_; M. B. right (no sense). 696. _thing is_; M. B. thynges is.\r\n 818. _martyre_; M. B. matere (neither sense nor rime).\r\n\r\nV. 49. _helpen_; M. B. holpen. 469. _howve_; M. B. howen. 583. _in my_; M.\r\nB. omit _my_. 927. _wight_; M. B. with. 1208. _trustinge_; M. B. trusten\r\n(against grammar). 1266. _bet_; M. B. beste. 1335, 6. _wyte The teres_,\r\ni. e. blame the tears; M. B. wite With teres. 1386. _Commeve_; M. Com in\r\nto; B. Can meven. 1467. _She_; M. B. So. 1791. _pace_; M. B. space (see\r\nnote).\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find that such remarkable words as _commeveden_, _io_,\r\n_voidee_, _goosish_, _to-hepe_, appear in no Chaucerian glossary; they are\r\nonly found in the MSS., being ignored in the editions.\r\n\r\nA large number of lines are now, for the first time, spelt with forms that\r\ncomply with grammar and enable the lines to be scanned. For example, M. and\r\nB. actually give _wente_ and _wonte_ in V. 546, instead of _went_ and\r\n_wont_; _knotles_ for _knotteles_ in V. 769, &c.\r\n\r\nI have also, for the first time, numbered the lines and stanzas correctly.\r\nIn M., Books III. and IV. are both misnumbered, causing much trouble in\r\nreference. Dr. Furnivall's print of the Campsall MS. omits I. 890-6; and\r\nhis print of MS. Harl. 3943 counts in the Latin lines here printed at p.\r\n404.\r\n\r\n§ 28. It is worth notice that Troilus contains about fifty lines in which\r\nthe first foot consists of a single syllable. Examples in Book I are:--\r\n\r\n  That | the hot-e fyr of lov' him brende: 490.\r\n  Lov' | ayeins the which who-so defendeth: 603.\r\n  Twen | ty winter that his lady wiste: 811.\r\n  Wer' | it for my suster, al thy sorwe: 860.\r\n  Next | the foule netle, rough and thikke: 948.\r\n  Now | Pandar', I can no mor-e seye: 1051.\r\n  Al | derfirst his purpos for to winne: 1069.\r\n\r\nSo also II. 369, 677, 934, 1034, 1623 (and probably 1687); III. 412, 526,\r\n662, 855 (perhaps 1552), 1570; IV. 176, 601, 716, 842, 1328, 1676; V. 67\r\n(perhaps 311), 334, 402, 802, 823, 825, 831, 880, 887, 949, 950, 1083,\r\n1094, 1151, 1379, 1446, 1454, 1468, 1524.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that deficient lines of this character are by no means\r\nconfined to the poems in 'heroic verse,' but occur in stanzas as well.\r\nCompare the Parlement of Foules, 445, 569.\r\n\r\n§ 29. PROVERBS. Troilus contains a considerable number of proverbs and\r\nproverbial phrases or similes. See, e. g., I. 257, 300, 631, 638, 694, 708,\r\n731, 740, 946-952, 960, 964, 1002, 1024; II. 343, 398, 403, 585, 784, 804,\r\n807, 861, 867, 1022, 1030, 1041, 1238, 1245, 1332, 1335, 1380, 1387, 1553,\r\n1745; III. 35, 198, 294, 308, 329, 405, 526, 711, 764, 775, 859, 861, 931,\r\n1625, 1633; IV. 184, 415, 421, 460, 588, 595, 622, 728, 836, 1098, 1105,\r\n1374, 1456, 1584; V. 484, 505, 784, 899, 971, 1174, 1265, 1433.\r\n\r\n§ 30. A translation of the first two books of Troilus into Latin verse, by\r\nSir Francis Kinaston, was printed at Oxford in 1635. The volume also\r\ncontains a few notes, but I do not find in them anything of value. The\r\nauthor tries to reproduce the English stanza, as thus:--\r\n\r\n 'Dolorem Troili duplicem narrare,\r\n  Qui Priami Regis Trojae fuit gnatus,\r\n  Vt primùm illi contigit amare,\r\n  Vt miser, felix, et infortunatus\r\n  Erat, decessum ante sum conatus.\r\n  Tisiphone, fer opem recensere\r\n  Hos versus, qui, dum scribo, visi flere.'\r\n\r\nFor myself, I prefer the English.\r\n\r\n§ 31. Hazlitt's Handbook to Popular Literature records the following\r\ntitle:--'A Paraphrase vpon the 3 first bookes of Chaucer's Troilus and\r\nCressida. Translated into modern English ... by J[onathan] S[idnam]. About\r\n1630. Folio; 70 leaves; in 7-line stanzas.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA AND ADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Is nat this the guerdoun that I referre to\r\n  thee, to whom I have be obeisaunt? Certes, thou confermedest,\r\n  by the mouth of Plato, this sentence, _that is to seyn_, that comune\r\n  thinges or comunalitees weren blisful, yif they that hadden studied    20\r\n  al fully to wisdom governeden thilke thinges, or elles yif it so\r\n  bifille that the governoures of comunalitees studieden to geten\r\n  wisdom.\r\n\r\n  Thou seidest eek, by the mouth of the same Plato, that it was\r\n  a necessarie cause, wyse men to taken and desire the governaunce       25\r\n  of comune thinges, for that the governements of citees, y-left\r\n  in the handes of felonous tormentours citizenes, ne sholde nat\r\n  bringe in pestilence and destruccioun to gode folk. And therfor\r\n  I, folwinge thilke auctoritee (_sc.

How ofte eek have I put of or cast out him,\r\n  Trigwille, provost of the kinges hous, bothe of the wronges that he\r\n  hadde bigunne to don, and eek fully performed? How ofte have\r\n  I covered and defended by the auctoritee of me, put ayeins perils--    45\r\n  _that is to seyn, put myn auctoritee in peril for_--the wrecched\r\n  pore folk, that the covetyse of straungeres unpunished tourmenteden\r\n  alwey with miseyses and grevaunces out of noumbre? Never man\r\n  ne drow me yit fro right to wronge. Whan I say the fortunes and\r\n  the richesses of the poeple of the provinces ben harmed or             50\r\n  amenused, outher by privee ravynes or by comune tributes or\r\n  cariages, as sory was I as they that suffreden the harm.\r\n\r\n  GLOSSA.  _Whan that Theodoric, the king of Gothes, in a dere\r\n  yere, hadde hise gerneres ful of corn, and comaundede that no man\r\n  ne sholde byen no corn til his corn were sold, and that at a grevous   55\r\n  dere prys, Boece withstood that ordinaunce, and over-com it, knowinge\r\n  al this the king him-self._\r\n\r\n  TEXTUS. Whan it was in the soure hungry tyme, ther was\r\n  establisshed or cryed grevous and inplitable coempcioun, that men\r\n  sayen wel it sholde greetly turmenten and endamagen al the             60\r\n  province of Campaigne, I took stryf ayeins the provost of the pretorie\r\n  for comune profit. And, the king knowinge of it, I overcom\r\n  it, so that the coempcioun ne was not axed ne took effect.\r\n\r\n  [GLOSSA.] _Coempcioun, that is to seyn, comune achat or bying\r\n  to-gidere, that were establisshed up-on the poeple by swiche a manere  65\r\n  imposicioun, as who-so boughte a busshel corn, he moste yeve the king\r\n  the fifte part._\r\n\r\n  [TEXTUS.] Paulin, a counseiller of Rome, the richesses of the\r\n  whiche Paulin the houndes of the palays, _that is to seyn, the\r\n      officeres_,\r\n  wolden han devoured by hope and covetise, yit drow I him out of        70\r\n  the Iowes (_sc. faucibus_) of hem that gapeden. And for as moche\r\n  as the peyne of the accusacioun aiuged biforn ne sholde nat\r\n  sodeinly henten ne punisshen wrongfully Albin, a counseiller of\r\n  Rome, I putte me ayeins the hates and indignaciouns of the\r\n  accusor Ciprian. Is it nat thanne y-nough y-seyn, that I have          75\r\n  purchased grete discordes ayeins my-self? But I oughte be the\r\n  more assured ayeins alle othre folk (_s. Romayns_), that for the love\r\n  of rightwisnesse I ne reserved never no-thing to my-self to hem-ward\r\n  of the kinges halle, _sc. officers_, by the whiche I were the more\r\n  siker. But thorugh tho same accusers accusinge, I am condempned.       80\r\n  Of the noumbir of the whiche accusers oon Basilius,\r\n  that whylom was chased out of the kinges service, is now compelled\r\n  in accusinge of my name, for nede of foreine moneye.\r\n  Also Opilion and Gaudencius han accused me, al be it so that the\r\n  Iustice regal hadde whylom demed hem bothe to go in-to exil for        85\r\n  hir trecheryes and fraudes withoute noumbir. To whiche Iugement\r\n  they nolden nat obeye, but defendeden hem by the sikernesse\r\n  of holy houses, _that is to seyn, fledden into seintuaries_; and\r\n  whan this was aperceived to the king, he comaundede, that but\r\n  they voidede the citee of Ravenne by certein day assigned, that        90\r\n  men sholde merken hem on the forheved with an hoot yren and\r\n  chasen hem out of the toune. Now what thing, semeth thee,\r\n  mighte ben lykned to this crueltee? For certes, thilke same day\r\n  was received the accusinge of my name by thilke same accusers.\r\n  What may ben seid her-to? (_quasi diceret, nichil_). Hath my           95\r\n  studie and my cunninge deserved thus; or elles the forseide dampnacioun\r\n  _of me_, made that hem rightful accusers or no? (_quasi\r\n  diceret, non_). Was not Fortune ashamed of this? Certes, al\r\n  hadde nat Fortune ben ashamed that innocence was accused, yit\r\n  oughte she han had shame of the filthe of myne accusours.             100\r\n\r\n  But, axestow in somme, of what gilt I am accused, men seyn\r\n  that I wolde save the companye of the senatours. And desirest\r\n  thou to heren in what manere? I am accused that I sholde han\r\n  destourbed the accuser to beren lettres, by whiche he sholde han\r\n  maked the senatoures gilty ayeins the kinges real maiestee. O         105\r\n  maistresse, what demestow of this? Shal I forsake this blame,\r\n  that I ne be no shame to thee? (_quasi diceret, non_). Certes, I have\r\n  wold it, _that is to seyn, the savacioun of the senat_, ne I shal never\r\n  leten to wilne it, and that I confesse and am aknowe; but the\r\n  entente of the accuser to be destourbed shal cese. For shal I         110\r\n  clepe it thanne a felonie or a sinne that I have desired the\r\n  savacioun of the ordre of the senat? (_quasi diceret, dubito quid_).\r\n  And certes yit hadde thilke same senat don by me, thorugh hir\r\n  decrets and hir Iugements, as though it were a sinne or a felonie;\r\n  _that is to seyn, to wilne the savacioun of hem_ (_sc. senatus_). But 115\r\n  folye, that lyeth alwey to him-self, may not chaunge the merite\r\n  of thinges. Ne I trowe nat, by the Iugement of Socrates, that\r\n  it were leveful to me to hyde the sothe, ne assente to lesinges.\r\n  But certes, how so ever it be of this, I putte it to gessen or\r\n  preisen to the Iugement of thee and of wyse folk. Of whiche           120\r\n  thing al the ordinaunce and the sothe, for as moche as folk that\r\n  ben to comen after our dayes shullen knowen it, I have put it\r\n  in scripture and in remembraunce. For touching the lettres falsly\r\n  maked, by whiche lettres I am accused to han hoped the fredom\r\n  of Rome, what aperteneth me to speke ther-of? Of whiche               125\r\n  lettres the fraude hadde ben shewed apertly, yif I hadde had\r\n  libertee for to han used and ben at the confessioun of myne\r\n  accusours, the whiche thing in alle nedes hath greet strengthe.\r\n  For what other fredom may men hopen? Certes, I wolde that\r\n  som other fredom mighte ben hoped. I wolde thanne han                 130\r\n  answered by the wordes of a man that highte Canius; for whan\r\n  he was accused by Gaius Cesar, Germeynes sone, that he\r\n  (_Canius_) was knowinge and consentinge of a coniuracioun\r\n  y-maked ayeins him (_sc. Gaius_), this Canius answerede thus:\r\n  \"Yif I hadde wist it, thou haddest nat wist it.\" In which thing       135\r\n  sorwe hath nat so dulled my wit, that I pleyne only that shrewede\r\n  folk aparailen felonies ayeins vertu; but I wondre greetly how\r\n  that they may performe thinges that they hadde hoped for to\r\n  don. For-why, to wilne shrewednesse, that comth peraventure\r\n  of oure defaute; but it is lyk a monstre and a mervaille, how         140\r\n  that, in the present sighte of god, may ben acheved and performed\r\n  swiche thinges as every felonous man hath conceived in his\r\n  thought ayeins innocents. For which thing oon of thy famileres\r\n  nat unskilfully axed thus: \"Yif god is, whennes comen wikkede\r\n  thinges? And yif god ne is, whennes comen gode thinges?\"              145\r\n  But al hadde it ben leveful that felonous folk, that now desiren\r\n  the blood and the deeth of alle gode men and eek of alle the\r\n  senat, han wilned to gon destroyen me, whom they han seyen\r\n  alwey batailen and defenden gode men and eek al the senat,\r\n  yit had I nat desserved of the faderes, _that is to seyn, of the      150\r\n  senatoures_, that they sholden wilne my destruccioun.\r\n\r\n  Thou remembrest wel, as I gesse, that whan I wolde doon or\r\n  seyen any thing, thou thyself, alwey present, rewledest me. At\r\n  the city of Verone, whan that the king, gredy of comune slaughter,\r\n  caste him to transporten up al the ordre of the senat the gilt of     155\r\n  his real maiestee, of the whiche gilt that Albin was accused, with\r\n  how gret sikernesse of peril to me defendede I al the senat!\r\n  Thou wost wel that I seye sooth, ne I ne avauntede me never\r\n  in preysinge of my-self. For alwey, whan any wight receiveth\r\n  precious renoun in avauntinge him-self of his werkes, he amenuseth    160\r\n  the secree of his conscience. But now thou mayst wel seen to\r\n  what ende I am comen for myne innocence; I receive peyne\r\n  of fals felonye for guerdon of verray vertu. And what open\r\n  confessioun of felonye hadde ever Iuges so acordaunt in crueltee,\r\n  _that is to seyn, as myn accusinge hath_, that either errour of\r\n      mannes                                                            165\r\n  wit or elles condicioun of Fortune, that is uncertein to alle mortal\r\n  folk, ne submittede some of hem, _that is to seyn, that it ne enclynede\r\n  som Iuge to han pitee or compassioun_? For al-thogh I hadde ben\r\n  accused that I wolde brenne holy houses, and strangle preestes\r\n  with wikkede swerde, or that I hadde greythed deeth to al gode        170\r\n  men, algates the sentence sholde han punisshed me, present,\r\n  confessed, or convict. But now I am remewed fro the citee _of\r\n  Rome_ almost fyve hundred thousand pas, I am with-oute defence\r\n  dampned to proscripcioun and to the deeth, for the studie and\r\n  bountees that I have doon to the senat. But O, wel ben they           175\r\n  worthy of merite (_as who seith, nay_), ther mighte never yit non\r\n  of hem be convict of swiche a blame as myne is! Of whiche\r\n  trespas, myne accusours sayen ful wel the dignitee; the whiche\r\n  dignitee, for they wolden derken it with medeling of som felonye,\r\n  they baren me on hand, and lyeden, that I hadde polut and             180\r\n  defouled my conscience with sacrilege, for coveitise of dignitee.\r\n  And certes, thou thy-self, that are plaunted in me, chacedest\r\n  out of the sege of my corage al coveitise of mortal thinges; ne\r\n  sacrilege hadde no leve to han a place in me biforn thyne eyen.\r\n  For thou droppedest every day in myne eres and in my thought          185\r\n  thilke comaundement of Pictagoras, _that is to seyn_, men shal\r\n  serve to godde, _and not to goddes_. Ne it was nat convenient,\r\n  _ne no nede_, to taken help of the foulest spirites; I, that thou\r\n  hast ordeined and set in swiche excellence that thou makedest\r\n  me lyk to god. And over this, the right clene secree chaumbre         190\r\n  of myne hous, _that is to seyn, my wyf_, and the companye of\r\n  myn honest freendes, and my wyves fader, as wel holy as worthy\r\n  to ben reverenced thorugh his owne dedes, defenden me from\r\n  alle suspecioun of swich blame. But O malice! For they that\r\n  accusen me taken of thee, _Philosophie_, feith of so gret blame!      195\r\n  For they trowen that I have had affinitee to malefice _or enchauntement_,\r\n  by-cause that I am replenisshed and fulfilled with thy\r\n  techinges, and enformed of thy maneres. And thus it suffiseth\r\n  not only, that thy reverence ne availe me not, but-yif that thou,\r\n  of thy free wille, rather be blemished with myn offencioun. But       200\r\n  certes, to the harmes that I have, ther bitydeth yit this\r\n  encrees of harm, that the gessinge and the Iugement of moche\r\n  folk ne looken no-thing to the desertes of thinges, but only\r\n  to the aventure of fortune; and iugen that only swiche thinges\r\n  ben purveyed of god, whiche that temporel welefulnesse commendeth.    205\r\n\r\n  GLOSE. _As thus: that, yif a wight have prosperitee, he is a\r\n  good man and worthy to han that prosperitee; and who-so hath\r\n  adversitee, he is a wikked man, and god hath forsake him, and\r\n  he is worthy to han that adversitee. This is the opinioun of some     210\r\n  folk._\r\n\r\n  And ther-of comth that good gessinge, first of alle thing, forsaketh\r\n  wrecches: certes, it greveth me to thinke right now the\r\n  dyverse sentences that the poeple seith of me. And thus moche\r\n  I seye, that the laste charge of contrarious fortune is this: that,   215\r\n  whan that any blame is leyd upon a caitif, men wenen that he\r\n  hath deserved that he suffreth. And I, that am put awey fro\r\n  gode men, and despoiled of dignitees, and defouled of my name\r\n  by gessinge, have suffred torment for my gode dedes. Certes,\r\n  me semeth that I see the felonous covines of wikked men               220\r\n  habounden in Ioye and in gladnesse. And I see that every\r\n  lorel shapeth him to finde out newe fraudes for to accuse gode\r\n  folk. And I see that gode men beth overthrowen for drede\r\n  of my peril; and every luxurious tourmentour dar doon alle\r\n  felonye unpunisshed and ben excited therto by yiftes; and             225\r\n  innocents ne ben not only despoiled of sikernesse but of defence;\r\n  and therfore me list to cryen _to god_ in this wyse:--\r\n\r\nPR.

But to wrecches is\r\n  a depper felinge of harm; _this is to seyn, that wrecches felen the\r\n  harmes that they suffren more grevously than the remedies or the       10\r\n  delites of thise wordes mowen gladen or comforten hem_; so that,\r\n  whan thise thinges stinten for to soune in eres, the sorwe that is\r\n  inset greveth the thought.'\r\n\r\n  'Right so is it,' quod she. 'For thise ne ben yit none remedies\r\n  of thy maladye; but they ben a maner norisshinges of thy sorwe,        15\r\n  yit rebel ayein thy curacioun.  For whan that tyme is, I shal\r\n  moeve swiche thinges that percen hem-self depe.

Who is it that ne seide tho                  25\r\n  that thou were right weleful, with so grete a nobleye of thy\r\n      fadres-in-lawe,\r\n  and with the chastitee of thy wyf, and with the oportunitee\r\n  and noblesse of thy masculin children, _that is to seyn, thy sones_?\r\n  And over al this--me list to passen the comune thinges--how\r\n  thou haddest in thy youthe dignitees that weren werned to olde         30\r\n  men. But it delyteth me to comen now to the singuler uphepinge\r\n  of thy welefulnesse. Yif any fruit of mortal thinges may han any\r\n  weighte or prys of welefulnesse, mightest thou ever foryeten, for\r\n  any charge of harm that mighte bifalle, the remembraunce of\r\n  thilke day that thou saye thy two sones maked conseileres, and         35\r\n  y-lad to-gedere fro thyn house under so greet assemblee of\r\n  senatoures and under the blythenesse of poeple; and whan thou\r\n  saye hem set in the court in here chayeres of dignitees?

Tho yave thou\r\n  wordes to Fortune, as I trowe, _that is to seyn, tho feffedest thou\r\n  Fortune with glosinge wordes and deceivedest hir_, whan she acoyede    45\r\n  thee and norisshede thee as hir owne delyces.

Wilt thou therfor leye a rekeninge with Fortune?\r\n  She hath now twinkled first upon thee with a wikkede eye. Yif\r\n  thou considere the noumbre and the manere of thy blisses and           50\r\n  of thy sorwes, thou mayst nat forsaken that thou art yit blisful.\r\n  For if thou therfor wenest thy-self nat weleful, for thinges that\r\n  tho semeden ioyful ben passed, ther nis nat why thou sholdest wene\r\n  thy-self a wrecche; for thinges that semen now sorye passen also.\r\n\r\n  Art thou now comen first, a sodein gest, in-to the shadwe or           55\r\n  tabernacle of this lyf; or trowest thou that any stedefastnesse be\r\n  in mannes thinges, whan ofte a swift houre dissolveth the same\r\n  man; _that is to seyn, whan the soule departeth fro the body_?

But this is a thing that greetly smerteth\r\n  me whan it remembreth me. For in alle adversitee of fortune,            5\r\n  the most unsely kinde of contrarious fortune is to han ben\r\n  weleful.'\r\n\r\n  'But that thou,' quod she, 'abyest thus the torment of thy\r\n  false opinioun, that mayst thou nat rightfully blamen ne aretten\r\n  to thinges: _as who seith, for thou hast yit many habundaunces of      10\r\n  thinges_.\r\n\r\n  TEXT. For al be it so that the ydel name of aventurous\r\n  welefulnesse moeveth thee now, it is leveful that thou rekne with\r\n  me of how manye grete thinges thou hast yit plentee. And\r\n  therfor, yif that thilke thing that thou haddest for most precious     15\r\n  in al thy richesse of fortune be kept to thee yit, by the grace of\r\n  god, unwemmed and undefouled, mayst thou thanne pleyne\r\n  rightfully upon the meschef of Fortune, sin thou hast yit thy\r\n  beste thinges? Certes, yit liveth in good point thilke precious\r\n  honour of mankinde, Symacus, thy wyves fader, which that is            20\r\n  a man maked alle of sapience and of vertu; the whiche man\r\n  thou woldest byen redely with the prys of thyn owne lyf. He\r\n  biwayleth the wronges that men don to thee, and nat for him-self;\r\n  for he liveth in sikernesse of any sentences put ayeins him. And\r\n  yit liveth thy wyf, that is atempre of wit, and passinge other         25\r\n  wimmen in clennesse of chastetee; and for I wol closen shortely\r\n  hir bountees, she is lyk to hir fader.  I telle thee wel, that she\r\n  liveth looth of this lyf, and kepeth to thee only hir goost; and is\r\n  al maat and overcomen by wepinge and sorwe for desyr of thee,\r\n  in the whiche thing only I moot graunten that thy welefulnesse is      30\r\n  amenused. What shal I seyn eek of thy two sones, conseilours,\r\n  of whiche, as of children of hir age, ther shyneth the lyknesse of\r\n  the wit of hir fader or of hir elder fader? And sin the sovereyn\r\n  cure of alle mortel folk is to saven hir owen lyves, O how weleful\r\n  art thou, yif thou knowe thy goodes! For yit ben ther                  35\r\n  thinges dwelled to thee-ward, that no man douteth that they ne\r\n  ben more dereworthe to thee than thyn owen lyf. And for-thy\r\n  drye thy teres, for yit nis nat everich fortune al hateful to thee-ward,\r\n  ne over greet tempest hath nat yit fallen upon thee, whan\r\n  that thyn ancres cleven faste, that neither wolen suffren the          40\r\n  counfort of this tyme present ne the hope of tyme cominge to\r\n  passen ne to faylen.'\r\n\r\n  'And I preye,' quod I, 'that faste moten they halden; for\r\n  whyles that they halden, how-so-ever that thinges ben, I shal wel\r\n  fleten forth and escapen; but thou mayst wel seen how grete            45\r\n  aparayles and aray that me lakketh, that ben passed away fro\r\n  me.'\r\n\r\n  'I have som-what avaunsed and forthered thee,' quod she, 'yif\r\n  that thou anoye nat or forthinke nat of al thy fortune: _as who\r\n  seith, I have som-what comforted thee, so that thou tempest thee nat   50\r\n  thus with al thy fortune, sin thou hast yit thy beste thinges_. But\r\n  I may nat suffren thy delices, that pleynest so wepinge and\r\n  anguissous, for that ther lakketh som-what to thy welefulnesse.\r\n  For what man is so sad or of so parfit welefulnesse, that he ne\r\n  stryveth and pleyneth on som halve ayen the qualitee of his            55\r\n  estat? For-why ful anguissous thing is the condicioun of mannes\r\n  goodes; for either it cometh nat al-togider to a wight, or elles it\r\n  last nat perpetuel. For sum man hath grete richesses, but he is\r\n  ashamed of his ungentel linage; and som is renowned of noblesse\r\n  of kinrede, but he is enclosed in so grete anguisshe of nede           60\r\n  of thinges, that him were lever that he were unknowe. And\r\n  som man haboundeth both in richesse and noblesse, but yit he\r\n  bewaileth his chaste lyf, for he ne hath no wyf. And som man is\r\n  wel and selily y-maried, but he hath no children, and norissheth\r\n  his richesses to the eyres of strange folkes. And som man is           65\r\n  gladed with children, but he wepeth ful sory for the trespas of\r\n  his sone or of his doughter. And for this ther ne acordeth no\r\n  wight lightly to the condicioun of his fortune; for alwey to every\r\n  man ther is in som-what that, unassayed, he ne wot nat; or elles\r\n  he dredeth that he hath assayed. And adde this also, that every        70\r\n  weleful man hath a ful delicat felinge; so that, but-yif alle thinges\r\n  bifalle at his owne wil, for he is impacient, or is nat used to han\r\n  non adversitee, anon he is throwen adoun for every litel thing.\r\n  And ful litel thinges ben tho that withdrawen the somme or the\r\n  perfeccioun of blisfulnesse fro hem that ben most fortunat. How        75\r\n  many men, trowest thou, wolden demen hem-self to ben almost in\r\n  hevene, yif they mighten atayne to the leest party of the remnaunt\r\n  of thy fortune? This same place that thou clepest exil, is\r\n  contree to hem that enhabiten heer, and forthy nothing [is]\r\n  wrecched but whan thou wenest it: _as who seith, thou thy-self, ne     80\r\n  no wight elles, nis a wrecche, but whan he weneth him-self a wrecche\r\n  by reputacioun of his corage_. And ayeinward, alle fortune is blisful\r\n  to a man by the agreabletee or by the egalitee of him that\r\n  suffreth it.\r\n\r\n  What man is that, that is so weleful, that nolde changen his           85\r\n  estat whan he hath lost pacience? The swetnesse of mannes\r\n  welefulnesse is sprayned with many biternesses; the whiche welefulnesse,\r\n  al-though it seme swete and ioyful to hem that useth it,\r\n  yit may it nat ben with-holden that it ne goth away whan it wole.\r\n  Thanne is it wel sene, how wrecched is the blisfulnesse of mortal      90\r\n  thinges, that neither it dureth perpetuel with hem that every\r\n  fortune receiven agreablely or egaly, ne it delyteth nat in al to\r\n  hem that ben anguissous. O ye mortal folk, what seke ye thanne\r\n  blisfulnesse out of your-self, whiche that is put in your-self?\r\n  Errour and folye confoundeth yow.                                      95\r\n\r\n  I shal shewe thee shortely the poynt of sovereyne blisfulnesse.\r\n  Is ther any-thing more precious to thee than thy-self? Thou\r\n  wolt answere, \"nay.\" Thanne, yif it so be that thou art mighty\r\n  over thy-self, _that is to seyn, by tranquillitee of thy sowle_, than\r\n      hast\r\n  thou thing in thy power that thou noldest never lesen, ne Fortune     100\r\n  ne may nat beneme it thee. And that thou mayst knowe that\r\n  blisfulnesse ne may nat standen in thinges that ben fortunous\r\n  and temporel, now understonde and gader it to-gidere thus:\r\n  Yif blisfulnesse be the sovereyn good of nature that liveth by\r\n  resoun, ne thilke thing nis nat sovereyn good that may be taken       105\r\n  awey in any wyse, (for more worthy thing and more digne is\r\n  thilke thing that may nat ben taken awey); than sheweth it wel,\r\n  that the unstablenesse of fortune may nat atayne to receiven\r\n  verray blisfulnesse. And yit more-over: what man that this\r\n  toumbling welefulnesse ledeth, either he woot that it is chaungeable, 110\r\n  or elles he woot it nat. And yif he woot it nat, what blisful\r\n  fortune may ther be in the blindnesse of ignorance? And yif he\r\n  woot that it is chaungeable, he moot alwey ben adrad that he ne\r\n  lese that thing that he ne doubteth nat but that he may lesen it;\r\n  _as who seith, he mot ben alwey agast, lest he lese that he wot wel\r\n      he                                                                115\r\n  may lese it_. For which, the continuel dreed that he hath ne\r\n  suffreth him nat to ben weleful. Or yif he lese it, he weneth to\r\n  be dispysed and forleten. Certes eek, that is a ful litel good that\r\n  is born with evene herte whan it is lost; _that is to seyn, that men\r\n  do no more fors of the lost than of the havinge_. And for as moche    120\r\n  as thou thy-self art he, to whom it hath ben shewed and proved\r\n  by ful manye demonstraciouns, as I wot wel, that the sowles of\r\n  men ne mowe nat deyen in no wyse; and eek sin it is cleer and\r\n  certein, that fortunous welefulnesse endeth by the deeth of the\r\n  body; it may nat ben douted that, yif that deeth may take awey        125\r\n  blisfulnesse, that alle the kinde of mortal thinges ne descendeth\r\n  in-to wrecchednesse by the ende of the deeth. And sin we knowen\r\n  wel, that many a man hath sought the fruit of blisfulnesse nat\r\n  only with suffringe of deeth, but eek with suffringe of peynes and\r\n  tormentes; how mighte than this present lyf maken men blisful,        130\r\n  sin that, whan thilke selve lyf is ended, it ne maketh folk no\r\n  wrecches?\r\n\r\nPR.

Now understond heer, al were it so that the yiftes of\r\n  Fortune ne were nat brutel ne transitorie, what is ther in hem\r\n  that may be thyn in any tyme, or elles that it nis foul, yif that it    5\r\n  be considered and loked perfitly? Richesses, ben they precious\r\n  by the nature of hem-self, or elles by the nature of thee? What is\r\n  most worth of richesses? Is it nat gold or might of moneye\r\n  assembled? Certes, thilke gold and thilke moneye shyneth and\r\n  yeveth betere renoun to hem that despenden it thanne to thilke         10\r\n  folk that mokeren it; for avarice maketh alwey mokereres to ben\r\n  hated, and largesse maketh folk cleer of renoun. For sin that\r\n  swich thing as is transferred fram o man to another ne may nat\r\n  dwellen with no man; certes, thanne is thilke moneye precious\r\n  whan it is translated into other folk and stenteth to ben had, by      15\r\n  usage of large yevinge _of him that hath yeven it_. And also: yif\r\n  that al the moneye that is over-al in the worlde were gadered\r\n  toward o man, it sholde maken alle other men to ben nedy as of that.\r\n  And certes a voys al hool, _that is to seyn, with-oute amenusinge_,\r\n  fulfilleth to-gidere the hering of moche folk; but certes, youre       20\r\n  richesses ne mowen nat passen in-to moche folke with-oute\r\n  amenusinge.

And the shyninge of gemmes, _that\r\n  I clepe precious stones_, draweth it nat the eyen of folk to hem-ward,\r\n  _that is to seyn, for the beautee_? But certes, yif ther were\r\n  beautee or bountee in the shyninge of stones, thilke cleernesse is\r\n  of the stones hem-self, and nat of men; for whiche I wondre            30\r\n  gretly that men mervailen on swiche thinges. For-why, what\r\n  thing is it, that yif it wanteth moeving and Ioynture of sowle and\r\n  body, that by right mighte semen a fair creature to him that hath\r\n  a sowle of resoun? For al be it so that gemmes drawen to hem-self\r\n  a litel of the laste beautee of the world, through the entente of      35\r\n  hir creatour and through the distinccioun of hem-self; yit, for as\r\n  mochel as they ben put under youre excellence, they ne han nat\r\n  deserved by no wey that ye sholden mervailen on hem. And\r\n  the beautee of feldes, delyteth it nat mochel un-to yow?'\r\n\r\n  _Boece._ 'Why sholde it nat delyten us, sin that it is a right fair    40\r\n  porcioun of the right faire werke, _that is to seyn, of this world_?\r\n  And right so ben we gladed som-tyme of the face of the see\r\n  whan it is cleer; and also mervailen we on the hevene and on the\r\n  sterres, and on the sonne and on the mone.'\r\n\r\n  _Philosophye._ 'Aperteneth,' quod she, 'any of thilke thinges to       45\r\n  thee? Why darst thou glorifyen thee in the shyninge of any\r\n  swiche thinges? Art thou distingwed and embelised by the\r\n  springinge floures of the first somer sesoun, or swelleth thy\r\n  plentee in the fruites of somer? Why art thou ravisshed with\r\n  ydel Ioyes? Why embracest thou straunge goodes as they weren           50\r\n  thyne? Fortune ne shal never maken that swiche thinges ben\r\n  thyne, that nature of thinges hath maked foreine fro thee. Sooth\r\n  is that, with-outen doute, the frutes of the erthe owen to ben to\r\n  the norissinge of bestes. And yif thou wolt fulfille thy nede after\r\n  that it suffyseth to nature, than is it no nede that thou seke after   55\r\n  the superfluitee of fortune. For with ful fewe things and with ful\r\n  litel thinges nature halt hir apayed; and yif thou wolt achoken\r\n  the fulfillinge of nature with superfluitees, certes, thilke thinges\r\n  that thou wolt thresten or pouren in-to nature shullen ben unioyful\r\n  to thee, or elles anoyous. Wenest thou eek that it be a fair           60\r\n  thing to shyne with dyverse clothinge? Of whiche clothinge yif\r\n  the beautee be agreeable to loken up-on, I wol mervailen on the\r\n  nature of the matere of thilke clothes, or elles on the werkman\r\n  that wroughte hem. But also a long route of meynee, maketh\r\n  that a blisful man? The whiche servants, yif they ben vicious of       65\r\n  condiciouns, it is a great charge and a distruccioun to the hous,\r\n  and a greet enemy to the lord him-self. And yif they ben goode\r\n  men, how shal straunge or foreine goodnesse ben put in the\r\n  noumbre of thy richesse? So that, by all these forseide thinges,\r\n  it is clearly y-shewed, that never oon of thilke thinges that thou     70\r\n  acountedest for thyne goodes nas nat thy good. In the whiche\r\n  thinges, yif ther be no beautee to ben desyred, why sholdest thou\r\n  ben sory yif thou lese hem, or why sholdest thou reioysen thee\r\n  to holden hem? For yif they ben faire of hir owne kinde, what\r\n  aperteneth that to thee? For al so wel sholden they han ben            75\r\n  faire by hem-selve, though they weren departed fram alle thyne\r\n  richesses. Forwhy faire ne precious ne weren they nat, for that\r\n  they comen among thy richesses; but, for they semeden faire and\r\n  precious, ther-for thou haddest lever rekne hem amonges thy\r\n  richesses.                                                             80\r\n\r\n  But what desirest thou of Fortune with so grete a noise, and\r\n  with so grete a fare? I trowe thou seke to dryve awey nede with\r\n  habundaunce of thinges; but certes, it torneth to you al in the\r\n  contrarie. Forwhy certes, it nedeth of ful manye helpinges to\r\n  kepen the diversitee of precious ostelments. And sooth it is,          85\r\n  that of manye thinges han they nede that manye thinges han; and\r\n  ayeinward, of litel nedeth hem that mesuren hir fille after the nede\r\n  of kinde, and nat after the outrage of coveityse. Is it thanne so,\r\n  that ye men ne han no proper good y-set in you, for which\r\n  ye moten seken outward youre goodes in foreine and subgit              90\r\n  thinges? So is thanne the condicioun of thinges torned up-so-down,\r\n  that a man, that is a devyne beest by merite of his resoun,\r\n  thinketh that him-self nis neither faire ne noble, but-yif it be\r\n  thorugh possessioun of ostelments that ne han no sowles. And\r\n  certes, al other thinges ben apayed of hir owne beautee; but ye        95\r\n  men, that ben semblable to god by your resonable thought,\r\n  desiren to aparailen your excellent kinde of the lowest thinges;\r\n  ne ye understonden nat how greet a wrong ye don to your\r\n  creatour. For he wolde that mankinde were most worthy and\r\n  noble of any othre erthely thinges; and ye threste adoun your         100\r\n  dignitees benethe the lowest thinges. For yif that al the good of\r\n  every thinge be more precious than is thilke thing whos that\r\n  the good is: sin ye demen that the fouleste thinges ben youre\r\n  goodes, thanne submitten ye and putten your-selven under tho\r\n  fouleste thinges by your estimacioun; and certes, this tydeth nat     105\r\n  with-oute youre desertes. For certes, swiche is the condicioun of\r\n  alle mankinde, that only whan it hath knowinge of it-selve, than\r\n  passeth it in noblesse alle other thinges; and whan it forleteth the\r\n  knowinge of it-self, than is it brought binethen alle beestes. For-why\r\n  al other livinge beestes han of kinde to knowe nat hem-self;          110\r\n  but whan that men leten the knowinge of hemself, it cometh hem\r\n  of vice. But how brode sheweth the errour and the folye of yow\r\n  men, that wenen that any thing may ben aparailed with straunge\r\n  aparailements! But for sothe that may nat ben doon. For yif\r\n  a wight shyneth with thinges that ben put to him, _as thus, if        115\r\n  thilke thinges shynen with which a man is aparailed_, certes, thilke\r\n  thinges ben comended and preysed with which he is aparailed;\r\n  but natheles, the thing that is covered and wrapped under that\r\n  dwelleth in his filthe.\r\n\r\n  And I denye that thilke thing be good that anoyeth him that           120\r\n  hath it. Gabbe I of this?. Thou wolt seye \"nay.\" Certes,\r\n  richesses han anoyed ful ofte hem that han tho richesses; sin that\r\n  every wikked shrewe, (and for his wikkednesse the more gredy\r\n  after other folkes richesses, wher-so ever it be in any place, be it\r\n  gold or precious stones), weneth him only most worthy that hath       125\r\n  hem. Thou thanne, that so bisy dredest now the swerd and now\r\n  the spere, yif thou haddest entred in the path of this lyf a voide\r\n  wayferinge man, than woldest thou singe beforn the theef; _as\r\n  who seith, a pore man, that berth no richesse on him by the weye,\r\n  may boldely singe biforn theves, for he hath nat wherof to ben        130\r\n  robbed_.

The whiche dignitees and\r\n  powers, yif they comen to any wikked man, they don as grete\r\n  damages and destrucciouns as doth the flaumbe of the mountaigne         5\r\n  Ethna, whan the flaumbe walweth up; ne no deluge ne doth so\r\n  cruel harmes. Certes, thee remembreth wel, as I trowe, that\r\n  thilke dignitee that men clepen the imperie of consulers, the\r\n  whiche that whylom was biginninge of fredom, youre eldres\r\n  coveiteden to han don away that dignitee, for the pryde of the         10\r\n  consulers. And right for the same pryde your eldres, biforn that\r\n  tyme, hadden don awey, out of the citee of Rome, the kinges\r\n  name; _that is to seyn, they nolde han no lenger no king_. But\r\n  now, yif so be that dignitees and powers be yeven to goode men,\r\n  the whiche thing is ful selde, what agreable thing is ther in tho      15\r\n  dignitees or powers but only the goodnesse of folkes that usen\r\n  hem? And therfor it is thus, that honour ne comth nat to vertu\r\n  for cause of dignitee, but ayeinward honour comth to dignitee for\r\n  cause of vertu. But whiche is thilke youre dereworthe power,\r\n  that is so cleer and so requerable? O ye ertheliche bestes,            20\r\n  considere ye nat over which thinge that it semeth that ye han\r\n  power? Now yif thou saye a mous amonges other mys, that\r\n  chalaunged to him-self-ward right and power over alle other mys,\r\n  how greet scorn woldest thou han of it! GLOSA. _So fareth it by\r\n  men; the body hath power over the body._ For yif thou loke wel         25\r\n  up-on the body of a wight, what thing shall thou finde more\r\n  freele than is mankinde; the whiche men wel ofte ben slayn with\r\n  bytinge of smale flyes, or elles with the entringe of crepinge\r\n  wormes in-to the privetees of mannes body? But wher shal man\r\n  finden any man that may exercen or haunten any right up-on             30\r\n  another man, but only up-on his body, or elles up-on thinges\r\n  that ben lowere than the body, the whiche I clepe fortunous\r\n  possessiouns? Mayst thou ever have any comaundement over\r\n  a free corage? Mayst thou remuen fro the estat of his propre\r\n  reste a thought that is clyvinge to-gidere in him-self by stedefast    35\r\n  resoun? As whylom a tyraunt wende to confounde a free man\r\n  of corage, and wende to constreyne him by torment, to maken\r\n  him discoveren and acusen folk that wisten of a coniuracioun,\r\n  _which I clepe a confederacie_, that was cast ayeins this tyraunt;\r\n  but this free man boot of his owne tonge and caste it in the           40\r\n  visage of thilke wode tyraunt; so that the torments that this\r\n  tyraunt wende to han maked matere of crueltee, this wyse man\r\n  maked it matere of vertu.\r\n\r\n  But what thing is it that a man may don to another man, that\r\n  he ne may receyven the same thing of othre folk in him-self:           45\r\n  _or thus, what may a man don to folk, that folk ne may don him the\r\n  same?_ I have herd told of Busirides, that was wont to sleen his\r\n  gestes that herberweden in his hous; and he was sleyn him-self\r\n  of Ercules that was his gest. Regulus hadde taken in bataile\r\n  many men of Affrike and cast hem in-to feteres; but sone after         50\r\n  he moste yeve his handes to ben bounde with the cheynes of\r\n  hem that he hadde whylom overcomen. Wenest thou thanne\r\n  that he be mighty, that hath no power to don a thing, that othre\r\n  ne may don in him that he doth in othre? And yit more-over,\r\n  yif it so were that thise dignitees or poweres hadden any propre       55\r\n  or natural goodnesse in hem-self, never nolden they comen to\r\n  shrewes. For contrarious thinges ne ben nat wont to ben\r\n  y-felawshiped to-gidere. Nature refuseth that contrarious thinges\r\n  ben y-ioigned. And so, as I am in certein that right wikked folk\r\n  han dignitees ofte tyme, than sheweth it wel that dignitees and        60\r\n  powers ne ben nat goode of hir owne kinde; sin that they suffren\r\n  hem-self to cleven or ioinen hem to shrewes. And certes, the\r\n  same thing may I most digneliche iugen and seyn of alle the\r\n  yiftes of fortune that most plentevously comen to shrewes; of\r\n  the whiche yiftes, I trowe that it oughte ben considered, that no      65\r\n  man douteth that he nis strong in whom he seeth strengthe; and\r\n  in whom that swiftnesse is, sooth it is that he is swift. Also\r\n  musike maketh musiciens, and phisike maketh phisiciens, and\r\n  rethorike rethoriens. For-why the nature of every thing maketh\r\n  his propretee, ne it is nat entremedled with the effects of the        70\r\n  contrarious thinges; and, as of wil, it chaseth out thinges that\r\n  ben to it contrarie. But certes, richesse may not restreyne\r\n  avarice unstaunched; ne power ne maketh nat a man mighty\r\n  over him-self, whiche that vicious lustes holden destreyned with\r\n  cheynes that ne mowen nat be unbounden. And dignitees that             75\r\n  ben yeven to shrewede folk nat only ne maketh hem nat digne,\r\n  but it sheweth rather al openly that they ben unworthy and\r\n  undigne. And why is it thus? Certes, for ye han Ioye to clepen\r\n  thinges with false names that beren hem alle in the contrarie;\r\n  the whiche names ben ful ofte reproeved by the effecte of the          80\r\n  same thinges; so that thise ilke richesses ne oughten nat by\r\n  right to ben cleped richesses; ne swich power ne oughte nat\r\n  ben cleped power; ne swich dignitee ne oughte nat ben cleped\r\n  dignitee.\r\n\r\n  And at the laste, I may conclude the same thing of alle the            85\r\n  yiftes of Fortune, in which ther nis nothing to ben desired, ne\r\n  that hath in him-self naturel bountee, as it is ful wel y-sene.

For see now and considere, how litel and how voide of          15\r\n  alle prys is thilke glorie. Certein thing is, as thou hast lerned by\r\n  the demonstracioun of astronomye, that al the environinge of the\r\n  erthe aboute ne halt nat but the resoun of a prikke at regard of the\r\n  greetnesse of hevene; that is to seyn, that yif ther were maked\r\n  comparisoun of the erthe to the greetnesse of hevene, men wolden       20\r\n  iugen in al, that the erthe ne helde no space. Of the whiche litel\r\n  regioun of this worlde, the ferthe partye is enhabited with livinge\r\n  bestes that we knowen, as thou thyself hast y-lerned by Tholomee\r\n  that proveth it. And yif thou haddest with-drawen and abated in\r\n  thy thought fro thilke ferthe partye as moche space as the see and     25\r\n  the mareys contenen and over-goon, and as moche space as the\r\n  regioun of droughte over-streccheth, _that is to seyn, sandes and\r\n  desertes_, wel unnethe sholde ther dwellen a right streit place to\r\n  the habitacioun of men. And ye thanne, that ben environed and\r\n  closed with-in the leste prikke of thilke prikke, thinken ye to        30\r\n  manifesten your renoun and don youre name to ben born forth?\r\n  But your glorie, that is so narwe and so streite y-throngen in-to so\r\n  litel boundes, how mochel coveiteth it in largesse and in greet\r\n  doinge? And also sette this there-to: that many a nacioun,\r\n  dyverse of tonge and of maneres and eek of resoun of hir livinge,      35\r\n  ben enhabited in the clos of thilke litel habitacle; to the whiche\r\n  naciouns, what for difficultee of weyes and what for dyversitee of\r\n  langages, and what for defaute of unusage and entrecomuninge of\r\n  marchaundise, nat only the names of singuler men ne may nat\r\n  strecchen, but eek the fame of citees ne may nat strecchen. At         40\r\n  the laste, certes, in the tyme of Marcus Tullius, as him-self writ in\r\n  his book, that the renoun of the comune of Rome ne hadde nat\r\n  yit passed ne cloumben over the mountaigne that highte Caucasus;\r\n  and yit was, thilke tyme, Rome wel waxen and greetly redouted of\r\n  the Parthes and eek of other folk enhabitinge aboute.

And ther-of comth it that, though a man delyte him in\r\n  preysinge of his renoun, he may nat in no wyse bringen forth ne\r\n  spreden his name to many maner poeples. There-for every man            55\r\n  oughte to ben apayed of his glorie that is publisshed among his\r\n  owne neighbours; and thilke noble renoun shal ben restreyned\r\n  within the boundes of o manere folke. But how many a man,\r\n  that was ful noble in his tyme, hath the wrecched and nedy\r\n  foryetinge of wryteres put out of minde and don awey!

But ye men, certes, ne conne don\r\n  nothing a-right, but-yif it be for the audience of poeple and for      80\r\n  ydel rumours; and ye forsaken the grete worthinesse of conscience\r\n  and of vertu, and ye seken your guerdouns of the smale wordes of\r\n  straunge folk.\r\n\r\n  Have now heer and understonde, in the lightnesse of swich\r\n  pryde and veine glorie, how a man scornede festivaly and merily        85\r\n  swich vanitee.

This feynede\r\n  philosophre took pacience a litel whyle, and, whan he hadde\r\n  received wordes of outrage, he, as in stryvinge ayein and reioysinge\r\n  of him-self, seyde at the laste right thus: \"understondest             95\r\n  thou nat that I am a philosophre?\" That other man answerde\r\n  ayein ful bytingly, and seyde: \"I hadde wel understonden it, yif\r\n  thou haddest holden thy tonge stille.\" But what is it to thise\r\n  noble worthy men (for, certes, of swiche folke speke I) that seken\r\n  glorie with vertu?

And blisfulnesse is swiche a good,\r\n  that who-so that hath geten it, he ne may, over that, no-thing\r\n  more desyre. And this thing is forsothe the sovereyn good that\r\n  conteyneth in him-self alle maner goodes; to the whiche good yif\r\n  ther failede any thing, it mighte nat ben cleped sovereyn good:        10\r\n  for thanne were ther som good, out of this ilke sovereyn good, that\r\n  mighte ben desired. Now is it cleer and certein thanne, that\r\n  blisfulnesse is a parfit estat by the congregacioun of alle goodes;\r\n  the whiche blisfulnesse, as I have seyd, alle mortal folk enforcen\r\n  hem to geten by diverse weyes. For-why the coveitise of verray         15\r\n  good is naturelly y-plaunted in the hertes of men; but the miswandringe\r\n  errour mis-ledeth hem in-to false goodes. Of the\r\n  whiche men, som of hem wenen that sovereyn good be to liven\r\n  with-oute nede of any thing, and travaylen hem to be haboundaunt\r\n  of richesses. And som other men demen that sovereyn good be,           20\r\n  for to ben right digne of reverence; and enforcen hem to ben\r\n  reverenced among hir neighbours by the honours that they han\r\n  y-geten. And some folk ther ben that holden, that right heigh\r\n  power be sovereyn good, and enforcen hem for to regnen, or elles\r\n  to ioignen hem to hem that regnen. And it semeth to some other         25\r\n  folk, that noblesse of renoun be the sovereyn good; and hasten\r\n  hem to geten glorious name by the arts of werre and of pees.\r\n  And many folk mesuren and gessen that sovereyn good be Ioye\r\n  and gladnesse, and wenen that it be right blisful thing to ploungen\r\n  hem in voluptuous delyt. And ther ben folk that entrechaungen          30\r\n  the causes and the endes of thise forseyde goodes, as they that\r\n  desiren richesses to han power and delytes; or elles they desiren\r\n  power for to han moneye, or for cause of renoun. In thise thinges,\r\n  and in swiche othre thinges, is torned alle the entencioun of\r\n  desiringes and of werkes of men; as thus: noblesse and favour          35\r\n  of people, whiche that yeveth to men, as it semeth hem, a maner\r\n  cleernesse of renoun; and wyf and children, that men desiren for\r\n  cause of delyt and of merinesse. But forsothe, frendes ne sholden\r\n  nat be rekned a-mong the godes of fortune, but of vertu; for it is\r\n  a ful holy maner thing. Alle thise othre thinges, forsothe, ben        40\r\n  taken for cause of power or elles for cause of delyt.\r\n\r\n  Certes, now am I redy to referren the goodes of the body to\r\n  thise forseide thinges aboven; for it semeth that strengthe and\r\n  gretnesse of body yeven power and worthinesse, and that beautee\r\n  and swiftnesse yeven noblesses and glorie of renoun; and hele of       45\r\n  body semeth yeven delyt. In alle thise thinges it semeth only\r\n  that blisfulnesse is desired. For-why thilke thing that every man\r\n  desireth most over alle thinges, he demeth that it be the sovereyn\r\n  good; but I have defyned that blisfulnesse is the sovereyn good;\r\n  for which every wight demeth, that thilke estat that he desireth       50\r\n  over alle thinges, that it be blisfulnesse.\r\n\r\n  Now hast thou thanne biforn thyn eyen almest al the purposed\r\n  forme of the welefulnesse of man-kinde, that is to seyn, richesses,\r\n  honours, power, and glorie, and delyts. The whiche delyt only\r\n  considerede Epicurus, and iuged and establisshed that delyt is         55\r\n  the sovereyn good; for as moche as alle othre thinges, as him\r\n  thoughte, bi-refte awey Ioye and mirthe fram the herte. But I\r\n  retorne ayein to the studies of men, of whiche men the corage\r\n  alwey reherseth and seketh the sovereyn good, al be it so that\r\n  it be with a derked memorie; but he not by whiche path, right          60\r\n  as a dronken man not nat by whiche path he may retorne him to\r\n  his hous. Semeth it thanne that folk folyen and erren that\r\n  enforcen hem to have nede of nothing? Certes, ther nis non other\r\n  thing that may so wel performe blisfulnesse, as an estat plentivous\r\n  of alle goodes, that ne hath nede of non other thing, but that is      65\r\n  suffisaunt of himself unto him-self. And folyen swiche folk thanne,\r\n  that wenen that thilke thing that is right good, that it be eek right\r\n  worthy of honour and of reverence? Certes, nay. For that thing\r\n  nis neither foul ne worthy to ben despised, that wel neigh al the\r\n  entencioun of mortal folk travaylen for to geten it. And power,        70\r\n  oughte nat that eek to ben rekened amonges goodes? What\r\n  elles? For it is nat to wene that thilke thing, that is most worthy\r\n  of alle thinges, be feble and with-oute strengthe. And cleernesse\r\n  of renoun, oughte that to ben despised? Certes, ther may no\r\n  man forsake, that al thing that is right excellent and noble, that it\r\n      ne                                                                 75\r\n  semeth to ben right cleer and renomed. For certes, it nedeth nat\r\n  to seye, that blisfulnesse be [nat] anguissous ne drery, ne subgit to\r\n  grevaunces ne to sorwes, sin that in right litel thinges folk seken\r\n  to have and to usen that may delyten hem. Certes, thise ben\r\n  the thinges that men wolen and desiren to geten. And for this          80\r\n  cause desiren they richesses, dignitees, regnes, glorie, and delices.\r\n  For therby wenen they to han suffisaunce, honour, power, renoun,\r\n  and gladnesse. Than is it good, that men seken thus by so many\r\n  diverse studies. In whiche desyr it may lightly ben shewed how\r\n  gret is the strengthe of nature; for how so that men han diverse       85\r\n  sentences and discordinge, algates men acorden alle in lovinge the\r\n  ende of good.\r\n\r\nPR.

And ther-of comth it that I have\r\n  right grete desdeyn, that dignitees ben yeven ofte to wikked\r\n  men; for which thing Catullus cleped _a consul of Rome, that\r\n  highte_ Nonius, \"postum\" or \"boch\"; _as who seyth, he cleped him\r\n  a congregacioun of vyces in his brest, as a postum is ful of\r\n      corupcioun_,                                                       10\r\n  al were this Nonius set in a chayre of dignitee. Seest thou nat\r\n  thanne how gret vilenye dignitees don to wikked men? Certes,\r\n  unworthinesse of wikked men sholde be the lasse y-sene, yif they\r\n  nere renomed of none honours. Certes, thou thyself ne mightest\r\n  nat ben brought with as manye perils as thou mightest suffren          15\r\n  that thou woldest beren the magistrat with Decorat; _that is to\r\n  seyn, that for no peril that mighte befallen thee by offence of the king\r\n  Theodorike, thou noldest nat be felawe in governaunce with Decorat_;\r\n  whan thou saye that he hadde wikked corage of a likerous shrewe\r\n  and of an accuser. Ne I ne may nat, for swiche honours, iugen          20\r\n  hem worthy of reverence, that I deme and holde unworthy to han\r\n  thilke same honours. Now yif thou saye a man that were fulfild\r\n  of wisdom, certes, thou ne mightest nat deme that he were unworthy\r\n  to the honour, or elles to the wisdom of which he is\r\n  fulfild?'--'No,' quod I.--'Certes, dignitees,' quod she, 'apertienen   25\r\n  proprely to vertu; and vertu transporteth dignitee anon to\r\n  thilke man to which she hir-self is conioigned. And for as moche\r\n  as honours of poeple ne may nat maken folk digne of honour, it\r\n  is wel seyn cleerly that they ne han no propre beautee of dignitee.\r\n  And yit men oughten taken more heed in this. For yif it so be          30\r\n  that a wikked wight be so mochel the foulere and the more out-cast,\r\n  that he is despysed of most folk, so as dignitee ne may nat\r\n  maken shrewes digne of reverence, the which shrewes dignitee\r\n  sheweth to moche folk, thanne maketh dignitee shrewes rather so\r\n  moche more despysed than preysed; and forsothe nat unpunisshed:        35\r\n  _that is for to seyn, that shrewes revengen hem ayeinward\r\n  up-on dignitees_; for they yilden ayein to dignitees as gret guerdoun,\r\n  whan they bi-spotten and defoulen dignitees with hir\r\n  vilenye. And for as mochel as thou mowe knowe that thilke\r\n  verray reverence ne may nat comen by thise shadewy transitorie         40\r\n  dignitees, undirstond now thus: yif that a man hadde used and\r\n  had many maner dignitees of consules, and were comen peraventure\r\n  amonge straunge naciouns, sholde thilke honour maken\r\n  him worshipful and redouted of straunge folk? Certes, yif that\r\n  honour of poeple were a naturel yift to dignitees, it ne mighte        45\r\n  never cesen nowher amonges no maner folk to don his office,\r\n  right as fyr in every contree ne stinteth nat to eschaufen and to\r\n  ben hoot. But for as moche as for to ben holden honourable or\r\n  reverent ne cometh nat to folk of hir propre strengthe of nature,\r\n  but only of the false opinioun of folk, _that is to seyn, that wenen   50\r\n  that dignitees maken folk digne of honour_; anon therfore whan\r\n  that they comen ther-as folk ne knowen nat thilke dignitees, hir\r\n  honours vanisshen awey, and that anon. But that is amonges\r\n  straunge folk, mayst thou seyn; but amonges hem ther they\r\n  weren born, ne duren nat thilke dignitees alwey? Certes, the           55\r\n  dignitee of the provostrie of Rome was whylom a gret power;\r\n  now is it nothing but an ydel name, and the rente of the senatorie\r\n  a gret charge. And yif a wight whylom hadde the office to taken\r\n  hede to the vitailes of the poeple, as of corn and other thinges, he\r\n  was holden amonges grete; but what thing is now more out-cast          60\r\n  thanne thilke provostrie? And, as I have seyd a litel her-biforn,\r\n  that thilke thing that hath no propre beautee of him-self receiveth\r\n  som-tyme prys and shyninge, and som-tyme leseth it by the\r\n  opinioun of usaunces. Now yif that dignitees thanne ne mowen\r\n  nat maken folk digne of reverence, and yif that dignitees wexen        65\r\n  foule of hir wille by the filthe of shrewes, and yif that dignitees\r\n  lesen hir shyninge by chaunginge of tymes, and yif they wexen\r\n  foule by estimacioun of poeple: what is it that they han in hem-self\r\n  of beautee that oughte ben desired? _as who seyth, non_;\r\n  thanne ne mowen they yeven no beautee of dignitee to non other.        70\r\n\r\nPR.

But, as I have y-shewed a litel\r\n  her-biforn, that yif ther be a blisfulnesse that be freele and\r\n  veyn and inparfit, ther may no man doute that ther nis som\r\n  blisfulnesse that is sad, stedefast, and parfit.'                      25\r\n\r\n  _Boece._ 'This is concluded,' quod I, 'fermely and sothfastly.'\r\n\r\n  _Philosophie._ 'But considere also,' quod she, 'in wham this\r\n  blisfulnesse enhabiteth. The comune acordaunce and conceite\r\n  of the corages of men proeveth and graunteth, that god, prince\r\n  of alle thinges, is good. For, so as nothing ne may ben thought        30\r\n  bettre than god, it may nat ben douted thanne that he, that\r\n  nothing nis bettre, that he nis good. Certes, resoun sheweth\r\n  that god is so good, that it proveth by verray force that parfit\r\n  good is in him. For yif god ne is swich, he ne may nat ben\r\n  prince of alle thinges; for certes som-thing possessing in it-self     35\r\n  parfit good, sholde ben more worthy than god, and it sholde\r\n  semen that thilke thing were first, and elder than god. For\r\n  we han shewed apertly that alle thinges that ben parfit ben\r\n  first or thinges that ben unparfit; and for-thy, for as moche as\r\n  that my resoun or my proces ne go nat a-wey with-oute an               40\r\n  ende, we owen to graunten that the soverein god is right ful\r\n  of soverein parfit good. And we han establisshed that the\r\n  soverein good is verray blisfulnesse: thanne mot it nedes be,\r\n  that verray blisfulnesse is set in soverein god.'\r\n\r\n  'This take I wel,' quod I, 'ne this ne may nat ben withseid            45\r\n  in no manere.'\r\n\r\n  'But I preye,' quod she, 'see now how thou mayst proeven,\r\n  holily and with-oute corupcioun, this that I have seyd, that the\r\n  soverein god is right ful of soverein good.'\r\n\r\n  'In which manere?' quod I.                                             50\r\n\r\n  'Wenest thou aught,' quod she, 'that this prince of alle\r\n  thinges have y-take thilke soverein good any-wher out of him-self,\r\n  of which soverein good men proveth that he is ful, right\r\n  as thou mightest thinken that god, that hath blisfulnesse in\r\n  him-self, and thilke blisfulnesse that is in him, weren dyvers in      55\r\n  substaunce? For yif thou wene that god have received thilke\r\n  good out of him-self, thou mayst wene that he that yaf thilke\r\n  good to god be more worthy than is god. But I am bi-knowen\r\n  and confesse, and that right dignely, that god is right worthy\r\n  aboven alle thinges; and, yif so be that this good be in him           60\r\n  by nature, but that it is dyvers fro him by weninge resoun,\r\n  sin we speke of god prince of alle thinges: feigne who-so\r\n  feigne may, who was he that hath conioigned thise dyverse\r\n  thinges to-gider?

Thanne\r\n  folweth it, that thilke thing that by his nature is dyvers fro\r\n  soverein good, that that thing nis nat soverein good; but certes,\r\n  that were a felonous corsednesse to thinken that of him that\r\n  nothing nis more worth. For alwey, of alle thinges, the nature         70\r\n  of hem ne may nat ben bettre than his biginning; for which\r\n  I may concluden, by right verray resoun, that thilke that is\r\n  biginning of alle thinges, thilke same thing is soverein good\r\n  in his substaunce.'\r\n\r\n  _Boece._ 'Thou hast seyd rightfully,' quod I.                          75\r\n\r\n  _Philosophie._ 'But we han graunted,' quod she, 'that the\r\n  soverein good is blisfulnesse.'\r\n\r\n  'And that is sooth,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Thanne,' quod she, 'moten we nedes graunten and confessen\r\n  that thilke same soverein good be god.'                                80\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod I, 'I ne may nat denye ne withstonde the\r\n  resouns purposed; and I see wel that it folweth by strengthe\r\n  of the premisses.'\r\n\r\n  'Loke now,' quod she, 'yif this be proved yit more fermely\r\n  thus: that ther ne mowen nat ben two soverein goodes that              85\r\n  ben dyverse amonge hem-self. For certes, the goodes that\r\n  ben dyverse amonges hem-self, that oon nis nat that that other\r\n  is; thanne ne [may] neither of hem ben parfit, so as either of\r\n  hem lakketh to other. But that that nis nat parfit, men may\r\n  seen apertly that it nis nat soverein. The thinges, thanne, that       90\r\n  ben sovereinly goode, ne mowen by no wey ben dyverse. But\r\n  I have wel concluded that blisfulnesse and god ben the soverein\r\n  good; for whiche it mot nedes ben, that soverein blisfulnesse\r\n  is soverein divinitee.'\r\n\r\n  'Nothing,' quod I, 'nis more soothfast than this, ne more              95\r\n  ferme by resoun; ne a more worthy thing than god may nat\r\n  ben concluded.'\r\n\r\n  'Up-on thise thinges thanne,' quod she, 'right as thise geometriens,\r\n  whan they han shewed hir proposiciouns, ben wont\r\n  to bringen in thinges that they clepen porismes, _or declaraciouns    100\r\n  of forseide thinges_, right so wole I yeve thee heer as a corollarie,\r\n  _or a mede of coroune_. For-why, for as moche as by the getinge\r\n  of blisfulnesse men ben maked blisful, and blisfulnesse is\r\n  divinitee: thanne is it manifest and open, that by the getinge\r\n  of divinitee men ben maked blisful. Right as by the getinge           105\r\n  of Iustice [they ben maked iust], and by the getinge of sapience\r\n  they ben maked wyse: right so, nedes, by the semblable resoun,\r\n  whan they han geten divinitee, they ben maked goddes. Thanne\r\n  is every blisful man god; but certes, by nature, ther nis but\r\n  o god; but, by the participacioun of divinitee, ther ne let ne        110\r\n  desturbeth nothing that ther ne ben manye goddes.'\r\n\r\n  'This is,' quod I, 'a fair thing and a precious, clepe it as\r\n  thou wolt; be it porisme or corollarie,' _or mede of coroune or\r\n  declaringes_.\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod she, 'nothing nis fayrer than is the thing that        115\r\n  by resoun sholde ben added to thise forseide thinges.'\r\n\r\n  'What thing?' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'So,' quod she, 'as it semeth that blisfulnesse conteneth many\r\n  thinges, it were for to witen whether that alle thise thinges maken\r\n  or conioignen as a maner body of blisfulnesse, by dyversitee of       120\r\n  parties or of membres; or elles, yif that any of alle thilke thinges\r\n  be swich that it acomplisshe by him-self the substaunce of\r\n  blisfulnesse, so that alle thise othre thinges ben referred and\r\n  brought to blisfulnesse,' _that is to seyn, as to the cheef of hem_.\r\n\r\n  'I wolde,' quod I, 'that thou makedest me cleerly to understonde      125\r\n  what thou seyst, and that thou recordedest me the forseyde\r\n  thinges.'\r\n\r\n  'Have I nat iuged,' quod she, 'that blisfulnesse is good?'\r\n\r\n  'Yis, forsothe,' quod I; 'and that soverein good.'\r\n\r\n  'Adde thanne,' quod she, 'thilke good, _that is maked blisfulnesse_,  130\r\n  to alle the forseide thinges; for thilke same blisfulnesse\r\n  that is demed to ben soverein suffisaunce, thilke selve is soverein\r\n  power, soverein reverence, soverein cleernesse _or noblesse_, and\r\n  soverein delyt. CONCLUSIO. What seyst thou thanne of alle thise\r\n  thinges, that is to seyn, suffisaunce, power, and this othre thinges; 135\r\n  ben they thanne as membres of blisfulnesse, or ben they referred\r\n  and brought to soverein good, right as alle thinges that ben brought\r\n  to the chief of hem?'\r\n\r\n  'I understonde wel;' quod I, 'what thou purposest to seke;\r\n  but I desire for to herkne that thou shewe it me.'                    140\r\n\r\n  'Tak now thus the discrecioun of this questioun,' quod she.\r\n  'Yif alle thise thinges,' quod she, 'weren membres to felicitee,\r\n  than weren they dyverse that oon from that other; and swich is\r\n  the nature of parties or of membres, that dyverse membres compounen\r\n  a body.'                                                              145\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod I, 'it hath wel ben shewed heer-biforn, that alle\r\n  thise thinges ben alle o thing.'\r\n\r\n  'Thanne ben they none membres,' quod she; 'for elles it\r\n  sholde seme that blisfulnesse were conioigned al of on membre\r\n  allone; but that is a thing that may nat be don.'                     150\r\n\r\n  'This thing,' quod I, 'nis nat doutous; but I abyde to herknen\r\n  the remnaunt of thy questioun.'\r\n\r\n  'This is open and cleer,' quod she, 'that alle othre thinges ben\r\n  referred and brought to good. For therefore is suffisaunce requered,\r\n  for it is demed to ben good; and forthy is power requered,            155\r\n  for men trowen also that it be good; and this same thing mowen\r\n  we thinken and coniecten of reverence, and of noblesse, and of\r\n  delyt. Thanne is soverein good the somme and the cause of al\r\n  that aughte ben desired; for-why thilke thing that with-holdeth\r\n  no good in it-self, ne semblaunce of good, it ne may nat wel in       160\r\n  no manere be desired ne requered. And the contrarie: for\r\n  thogh that thinges by hir nature ne ben nat goode, algates, yif\r\n  men wene that ben goode, yit ben they desired as though that\r\n  they weren verrayliche goode. And therfor is it that men oughten\r\n  to wene by right, that bountee be the soverein fyn, and the cause     165\r\n  of alle the thinges that ben to requeren. But certes, thilke that\r\n  is cause for which men requeren any thing, it semeth that thilke\r\n  same thing be most desired. As thus: yif that a wight wolde\r\n  ryden for cause of hele, he ne desireth nat so mochel the moevinge\r\n  to ryden, as the effect of his hele. Now thanne, sin that             170\r\n  alle thinges ben requered for the grace of good, they ne ben nat\r\n  desired of alle folk more thanne the same good. But we han\r\n  graunted that blisfulnesse is that thing, for whiche that alle thise\r\n  othre thinges ben desired; thanne is it thus: that, certes, only\r\n  blisfulnesse is requered and desired. By whiche thing it sheweth      175\r\n  cleerly, that of good and of blisfulnesse is al oon and the same\r\n  substaunce.'\r\n\r\n  'I see nat,' quod I, 'wherfore that men mighten discorden in\r\n  this.'\r\n\r\n  'And we han shewed that god and verray blisfulnesse is al oo          180\r\n  thing.'\r\n\r\n  'That is sooth,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Thanne mowen we conclude sikerly, that the substaunce of\r\n  god is set in thilke same good, and in non other place.               184\r\n\r\nPR.

What woltow\r\n  seyn of this, that they drawen alle hir norisshinges by hir rotes,\r\n  right as they hadden hir mouthes y-plounged with-in the erthes,\r\n  and sheden by hir maryes hir wode and hir bark? And what\r\n  woltow seyn of this, that thilke thing that is right softe, as the     85\r\n  marye is, that is alwey hid in the sete, al with-inne, and that\r\n  is defended fro with-oute by the stedefastnesse of wode; and\r\n  that the uttereste bark is put ayeins the destemperaunce of\r\n  the hevene, as a defendour mighty to suffren harm? And thus,\r\n  certes, maystow wel seen how greet is the diligence of nature;         90\r\n  for alle thinges renovelen and puplisshen hem with seed y-multiplyed;\r\n  ne ther nis no man that ne wot wel that they ne\r\n  ben right as a foundement and edifice, for to duren nat only\r\n  for a tyme, but right as for to duren perdurably by generacioun.\r\n  And the thinges eek that men wenen ne haven none sowles,               95\r\n  ne desire they nat ech of hem by semblable resoun to kepen\r\n  that is hirs, _that is to seyn, that is acordinge to hir nature in\r\n  conservacioun of hir beinge and enduringe_? For wher-for elles\r\n  bereth lightnesse the flaumbes up, and the weighte presseth\r\n  the erthe a-doun, but for as moche as thilke places and thilke        100\r\n  moevinges ben covenable to everich of hem? And forsothe\r\n  every thing kepeth thilke that is acordinge and propre to him,\r\n  right as thinges that ben contraries and enemys corompen hem.\r\n  And yit the harde thinges, as stones, clyven and holden hir\r\n  parties to-gider right faste and harde, and deffenden hem in          105\r\n  withstondinge that they ne departe nat lightly a-twinne. And\r\n  the thinges that ben softe and fletinge, as is water and eyr,\r\n  they departen lightly, and yeven place to hem that breken or\r\n  devyden hem; but natheles, they retornen sone ayein in-to\r\n  the same thinges fro whennes they ben arraced. But fyr fleeth         110\r\n  and refuseth al devisioun. Ne I ne trete nat heer now of\r\n  wilful moevinges of the sowle that is knowinge, but of the\r\n  naturel entencioun of thinges, as thus: right as we swolwe the\r\n  mete that we receiven and ne thinke nat on it, and as we\r\n  drawen our breeth in slepinge that we wite it nat whyle we            115\r\n  slepen. For certes, in the beestes, the love of hir livinges ne\r\n  of hir beinges ne comth nat of the wilninges of the sowle, but\r\n  of the biginninges of nature. For certes, thorugh constreininge\r\n  causes, wil desireth and embraceth ful ofte tyme the deeth\r\n  that nature dredeth; _that is to seyn as thus: that a man may         120\r\n  ben constreyned so, by som cause, that his wil desireth and\r\n  taketh the deeth which that nature hateth and dredeth ful sore_.\r\n  And somtyme we seeth the contrarye, as thus: that the wil\r\n  of a wight destorbeth and constreyneth that that nature desireth\r\n  and requereth al-wey, _that is to seyn_, the werk of generacioun,     125\r\n  by the whiche generacioun only dwelleth and is sustened the\r\n  long durabletee of mortal thinges.\r\n\r\n  And thus this charitee and this love, that every thing hath\r\n  to him-self, ne comth nat of the moevinge of the sowle, but\r\n  of the entencioun of nature. For the purviaunce of god hath           130\r\n  yeven to thinges that ben creat of him this, that is a ful\r\n  gret cause to liven and to duren; for which they desiren\r\n  naturelly hir lyf as longe as ever they mowen.

For yif that wil lakketh, ther\r\n  nis no wight that undertaketh to don that he wol nat don; and          20\r\n  yif power fayleth, the wil nis but in ydel and stant for naught.\r\n  And ther-of cometh it, that yif thou see a wight that wolde geten\r\n  that he may nat geten, thou mayst nat douten that power ne\r\n  fayleth him to haven that he wolde.'\r\n\r\n  'This is open and cleer,' quod I; 'ne it may nat ben deneyed           25\r\n  in no manere.'\r\n\r\n  'And yif thou see a wight,' quod she, 'that hath doon that he\r\n  wolde doon, thou nilt nat douten that he ne hath had power to\r\n  don it?'\r\n\r\n  'No,' quod I.                                                          30\r\n\r\n  'And in that that every wight may, in that men may holden\r\n  him mighty; _as who seyth, in so moche as man is mighty to don a\r\n  thing, in so mochel men halt him mighty_; and in that that he ne\r\n  may, in that men demen him to be feble.'\r\n\r\n  'I confesse it wel,' quod I.                                           35\r\n\r\n  'Remembreth thee,' quod she, 'that I have gadered and\r\n  shewed by forseyde resouns that al the entencioun of the wil of\r\n  mankinde, which that is lad by dyverse studies, hasteth to\r\n  comen to blisfulnesse?'\r\n\r\n  'It remembreth me wel,' quod I, 'that it hath ben shewed.'             40\r\n\r\n  'And recordeth thee nat thanne,' quod she, 'that blisfulnesse\r\n  is thilke same good that men requeren; so that, whan that\r\n  blisfulnesse is requered of alle, that good also is requered and\r\n  desired of alle?'\r\n\r\n  'It ne recordeth me nat,' quod I; 'for I have it gretly alwey          45\r\n  ficched in my memorie.'\r\n\r\n  'Alle folk thanne,' quod she, 'goode and eek badde, enforcen\r\n  hem with-oute difference of entencioun to comen to good?'\r\n\r\n  'This is a verray consequence,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'And certein is,' quod she, 'that by the getinge of good ben           50\r\n  men y-maked goode?'\r\n\r\n  'This is certein,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Thanne geten goode men that they desiren?'\r\n\r\n  'So semeth it,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'But wikkede folk,' quod she, 'yif they geten the good that            55\r\n  they desiren, they ne mowe nat be wikkede?'\r\n\r\n  'So is it,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Thanne, so as that oon and that other,' quod she, 'desiren\r\n  good; and the goode folk geten good, and nat the wikke folk;\r\n  thanne nis it no doute that the goode folk ne ben mighty and           60\r\n  the wikkede folk ben feble?'\r\n\r\n  'Who-so that ever,' quod I, 'douteth of this, he ne may nat\r\n  considere the nature of thinges ne the consequence of resouns.'\r\n\r\n  And over this quod she, 'yif that ther be two thinges that\r\n  han oo same purpose by kinde, and that oon of hem pursueth             65\r\n  and parformeth thilke same thing by naturel office, and that\r\n  other ne may nat doon thilke naturel office, but folweth, by other\r\n  manere thanne is convenable to nature, him that acomplissheth\r\n  his purpos kindely, and yit he ne acomplissheth nat his owne\r\n  purpos: whether of thise two demestow for more mighty?'                70\r\n\r\n  'Yif that I coniecte,' quod I, 'that thou wolt seye, algates yit\r\n  I desire to herkne it more pleynly of thee.'\r\n\r\n  'Thou wilt nat thanne deneye,' quod she, 'that the moevement\r\n  of goinge nis in men by kinde?'\r\n\r\n  'No, forsothe,' quod I.                                                75\r\n\r\n  'Ne thou ne doutest nat,' quod she, 'that thilke naturel office\r\n  of goinge ne be the office of feet?'\r\n\r\n  'I ne doute it nat,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Thanne,' quod she, 'yif that a wight be mighty to moeve and\r\n  goth upon his feet, and another, to whom thilke naturel office of      80\r\n  feet lakketh, enforceth him to gon crepinge up-on his handes:\r\n  whiche of thise two oughte to ben holden the more mighty by\r\n  right?'\r\n\r\n  'Knit forth the remenaunt,' quod I; 'for no wight ne douteth\r\n  that he that may gon by naturel office of feet ne be more mighty       85\r\n  than he that ne may nat.'\r\n\r\n  'But the soverein good,' quod she, 'that is eveneliche purposed\r\n  to the gode folk and to badde, the gode folk seken it by naturel\r\n  office of vertues, and the shrewes enforcen hem to geten it by\r\n  dyverse coveityse _of erthely thinges_, which that nis no naturel\r\n      office                                                             90\r\n  to geten thilke same soverein good. Trowestow that it be any\r\n  other wyse?'\r\n\r\n  'Nay,' quod I; 'for the consequence is open and shewinge of\r\n  thinges that I have graunted; that nedes gode folk moten ben\r\n  mighty, and shrewes feeble and unmighty.'                              95\r\n\r\n  'Thou rennest a-right biforn me,' quod she, 'and this is the\r\n  Iugement; _that is to seyn, I iuge of thee_ right as thise leches ben\r\n  wont to hopen _of syke folk, whan they aperceyven_ that nature is\r\n  redressed and withstondeth to the maladye. But, for I see thee\r\n  now al redy to the understondinge, I shal shewe thee more thikke      100\r\n  and continuel resouns. For loke now how greetly sheweth the\r\n  feblesse and infirmitee of wikkede folk, that ne mowen nat comen\r\n  to that hir naturel entencioun ledeth hem, and yit almost thilke\r\n  naturel entencioun constreineth hem. And what _were to demen\r\n  thanne of shrewes_, yif thilke naturel help hadde forleten hem, the   105\r\n  which _naturel help of intencioun_ goth awey biforn hem, and is so\r\n  greet that unnethe it may ben overcome? Consider thanne how\r\n  greet defaute of power and how greet feblesse ther is in wikkede\r\n  felonous folk; _as who seyth, the gretter thing that is coveited and\r\n  the desire nat acomplisshed, of the lasse might is he that coveiteth\r\n      it                                                                110\r\n  and may nat acomplisshe. And forthy Philosophie seyth thus by\r\n  soverein good_: Ne shrewes ne requeren nat lighte medes ne veyne\r\n  games, whiche they ne may folwen ne holden; but they failen of\r\n  thilke somme and of the heighte of thinges, _that is to seyn, soverein\r\n  good_; ne thise wrecches ne comen nat to the effect _of soverein      115\r\n  good_, the which they enforcen hem only to geten, by nightes and\r\n  by dayes; in the getinge of which good the strengthe of good folk\r\n  is ful wel y-sene. For right so as thou mightest demen him mighty\r\n  of goinge, that gooth on his feet til he mighte come to thilke\r\n  place, fro the whiche place ther ne laye no wey forther to ben        120\r\n  gon; right so most thou nedes demen him for right mighty, that\r\n  geteth and ateyneth to the ende of alle thinges that ben to desire,\r\n  biyonde the whiche ende ther nis nothing to desire. Of the\r\n  which _power of good folk_ men may conclude, that the wikked\r\n  men semen to be bareine and naked of alle strengthe. For-why          125\r\n  forleten they vertues and folwen vyces? Nis it nat for that they\r\n  ne knowen nat the goodes? But what thing is more feble and\r\n  more caitif thanne is the blindnesse of ignoraunce? Or elles they\r\n  knowen ful wel whiche thinges that they oughten folwe, but\r\n  lecherye and coveityse overthroweth hem mistorned; and certes,        130\r\n  so doth distemperaunce to feble men, that ne mowen nat wrastlen\r\n  ayeins the vyces. Ne knowen they nat thanne wel that they\r\n  forleten the good wilfully, and tornen hem wilfully to vyces? And\r\n  in this wyse they ne forleten nat only to ben mighty, but they\r\n  forleten al-outrely in any wyse for to ben. For they that forleten    135\r\n  the comune fyn of alle thinges that ben, they forleten also therwith-al\r\n  for to ben.\r\n\r\n  And per-aventure it sholde semen to som folk that this were\r\n  a merveile to seyen: that shrewes, whiche that contienen the more\r\n  partye of men, ne ben nat ne han no beinge; but natheles, it is so,   140\r\n  and thus stant this thing. For they that ben shrewes, I deneye\r\n  nat that they ben shrewes; but I deneye, and seye simplely and\r\n  pleinly, that they ne ben nat, ne han no beinge. For right as\r\n  thou mightest seyen of the carayne of a man, that it were a deed\r\n  man, but thou ne mightest nat simplely callen it a man; so graunte    145\r\n  I wel forsothe, that vicious folk ben wikked, but I ne may nat\r\n  graunten absolutly and simplely that they ben. For thilke thing\r\n  that with-holdeth ordre and kepeth nature, thilke thing is and\r\n  hath beinge; but what thing that faileth of that, _that is to seyn,\r\n  that he forleteth naturel ordre_, he forleteth thilke thing that is\r\n      set                                                               150\r\n  in his nature. But thou wolt seyn, that shrewes mowen. Certes,\r\n  that ne deneye I nat; but certes, hir power ne descendeth nat of\r\n  strengthe, but of feblesse. For they mowen don wikkednesses;\r\n  the whiche they ne mighte nat don, yif they mighten dwellen in\r\n  the forme and in the doinge of good folk. And thilke power            155\r\n  sheweth ful evidently that they ne mowen right naught. For so\r\n  as I have gadered and proeved a litel her-biforn, that yvel is\r\n  naught; and so as shrewes mowen only but shrewednesses, this\r\n  conclusioun is al cleer, that shrewes ne mowen right naught, ne\r\n  han no power.                                                         160\r\n\r\n  And for as moche as thou understonde which is the strengthe\r\n  of this power of shrewes, I have definisshed a litel her-biforn, that\r\n  nothing is so mighty as soverein good.'\r\n\r\n  'That is sooth,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'And thilke same soverein good may don non yvel?'                     165\r\n\r\n  'Certes, no,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Is ther any wight thanne,' quod she, 'that weneth that men\r\n  mowen doon alle thinges?'\r\n\r\n  'No man,' quod I, 'but-yif he be out of his witte.'\r\n\r\n  'But, certes, shrewes mowen don yvel,' quod she.                      170\r\n\r\n  'Ye, wolde god,' quod I, 'that they mighten don non!'\r\n\r\n  'Thanne,' quod she, 'so as he that is mighty to doon only but\r\n  goode thinges may don alle thinges; and they that ben mighty to\r\n  don yvele thinges ne mowen nat alle thinges: thanne is it open\r\n  thing and manifest, that they that mowen don yvel ben of lasse        175\r\n  power. And yit, _to proeve this conclusioun_, ther helpeth me this,\r\n  that I have y-shewed her-biforn, that alle power is to be noumbred\r\n  among thinges that men oughten requere. And I have shewed\r\n  that alle thinges, that oughten ben desired, ben referred to good,\r\n  right as to a maner heighte of hir nature. But for to mowen don       180\r\n  yvel and felonye ne may nat ben referred to good. Thanne nis\r\n  nat yvel of the noumbir of thinges that oughte ben desired. But\r\n  alle power oughte ben desired and requered. Than is it open and\r\n  cleer that the power ne the mowinge of shrewes nis no power; and\r\n  of alle thise thinges it sheweth wel, that the goode folke ben\r\n      certeinly                                                         185\r\n  mighty, and the shrewes douteles ben unmighty. And it is\r\n  cleer and open that thilke opinioun of Plato is verray and sooth, that\r\n  seith, that only wyse men may doon that they desiren; and\r\n  shrewes mowen haunten that hem lyketh, but that they desiren,\r\n  _that is to seyn, to comen to sovereign good_, they ne han no power   190\r\n  to acomplisshen that. For shrewes don that hem list, whan, by\r\n  tho thinges in which they delyten, they wenen to ateine to thilke\r\n  good that they desiren; but they ne geten ne ateinen nat ther-to,\r\n  for vyces ne comen nat to blisfulnesse.\r\n\r\nPR.

In\r\n  this sheweth it wel, that to goode folk ne lakketh never-mo hir\r\n  medes, ne shrewes lakken never-mo torments. For of alle thinges\r\n  that ben y-doon, thilke thing, for which any-thing is don, it semeth    5\r\n  as by right that thilke thing be the mede of that; as thus: yif\r\n  a man renneth in the stadie, _or in the forlong_, for the corone,\r\n  thanne lyth the mede in the corone for which he renneth. And\r\n  I have shewed that blisfulnesse is thilke same good for which\r\n  that alle thinges ben doon. Thanne is thilke same good purposed        10\r\n  to the workes of mankinde right as a comune mede; which\r\n  mede ne may ben dissevered fro good folk. For no wight as by\r\n  right, fro thennes-forth that him lakketh goodnesse, ne shal ben\r\n  cleped good. For which thing, folk of goode maneres, hir medes\r\n  ne forsaken hem never-mo. For al-be-it so that shrewes wexen           15\r\n  as wode as hem list _ayeins goode folk_, yit never-the-lesse the\r\n  corone of wyse men shal nat fallen ne faden. For foreine shrewednesse\r\n  ne binimeth nat fro the corages of goode folk hir propre\r\n  honour. But yif that any wight reioyse him of goodnesse that he\r\n  hadde take fro with-oute (_as who seith, yif that any wight hadde      20\r\n  his goodnesse of any other man than of him-self_), certes, he that yaf\r\n  him thilke goodnesse, or elles som other wight, mighte binime it\r\n  him. But for as moche as to every wight his owne propre bountee\r\n  yeveth him his mede, thanne at erst shal he failen of mede whan\r\n  he forleteth to ben good. And at the laste, so as alle medes ben       25\r\n  requered for men wenen that they ben goode, who is he that\r\n  wolde deme, that he that is right mighty of good were part-les of\r\n  mede? And of what mede shal he be guerdoned? Certes, of\r\n  right faire mede and right grete aboven alle medes. Remembre\r\n  thee of thilke noble corolarie that I yaf thee a litel her-biforn;     30\r\n  and gader it to-gider in this manere:--so as good him-self is\r\n  blisfulnesse, thanne is it cleer and certein, that alle good folk ben\r\n  maked blisful for they ben goode; and thilke folk that ben blisful,\r\n  it acordeth and is covenable to ben goddes. Thanne is the mede\r\n  of goode folk swich that no day shal enpeiren it, ne no wikkednesse    35\r\n  ne shal derken it, ne power of no wight ne shal nat amenusen it,\r\n  _that is to seyn_, to ben maked goddes.\r\n\r\n  And sin it is thus, _that goode men ne failen never-mo of hir mede_,\r\n  certes, no wys man ne may doute of undepartable peyne of the\r\n  shrewes; _that is to seyn, that the peyne of shrewes ne departeth nat  40\r\n  from hem-self never-mo_. For so as goode and yvel, and peyne and\r\n  medes ben contrarye, it mot nedes ben, that right as we seen\r\n  bityden in guerdoun of goode, that also mot the peyne of yvel\r\n  answery, by the contrarye party, to shrewes. Now thanne, so as\r\n  bountee and prowesse ben the mede to goode folk, al-so is              45\r\n  shrewednesse it-self torment to shrewes. Thanne, who-so that\r\n  ever is entecched and defouled with peyne, he ne douteth nat,\r\n  that he is entecched and defouled with yvel. Yif shrewes thanne\r\n  wolen preysen hem-self, may it semen to hem that they ben with-outen\r\n  party of torment, sin they ben swiche that the uttereste               50\r\n  wikkednesse (_that is to seyn, wikkede thewes, which that is the\r\n  uttereste and the worste kinde of shrewednesse_) ne defouleth ne\r\n  enteccheth nat hem only, but infecteth and envenimeth hem\r\n  gretly? And also look on shrewes, that ben the contrarie party\r\n  of goode men, how greet peyne felawshipeth and folweth hem!            55\r\n  For thou hast lerned a litel her-biforn, that al thing that is and\r\n  hath beinge is oon, and thilke same oon is good; thanne is this\r\n  the consequence, that it semeth wel, that al that is and hath beinge\r\n  is good; _this is to seyn, as who seyth, that beinge and unitee and\r\n  goodnesse is al oon_. And in this manere it folweth thanne, that al    60\r\n  thing that faileth to ben good, it stinteth for to be and for to han\r\n  any beinge; wherfore it is, that shrewes stinten for to ben that\r\n  they weren. But thilke other forme of mankinde, that is to seyn,\r\n  the forme of the body with-oute, sheweth yit that thise shrewes\r\n  weren whylom men; wher-for, whan they ben perverted and                65\r\n  torned in-to malice, certes, than han they forlorn the nature of\r\n  mankinde. But so as only bountee and prowesse may enhaunsen\r\n  every man over other men; thanne mot it nedes be that shrewes,\r\n  which that shrewednesse hath cast out of the condicioun of mankinde,\r\n  ben put under the merite and the desert of men. Thanne                 70\r\n  bitydeth it, that yif thou seest a wight that be transformed into\r\n  vyces, thou ne mayst nat wene that he be a man.\r\n\r\n  For yif he be ardaunt in avaryce, and that he be a ravinour by\r\n  violence of foreine richesse, thou shalt seyn that he is lyke to the\r\n  wolf. And yif he be felonous and with-oute reste, and exercyse         75\r\n  his tonge to chydinges, thou shalt lykne him to the hound. And\r\n  yif he be a prevey awaitour y-hid, and reioyseth him to ravisshe\r\n  by wyles, thou shalt seyn him lyke to the fox-whelpes. And yif he\r\n  be distempre and quaketh for ire, men shal wene that he bereth\r\n  the corage of a lyoun. And yif he be dredful and fleinge, and          80\r\n  dredeth thinges that ne oughten nat to ben dred, men shal holden\r\n  him lyk to the hert. And yif he be slow and astoned and lache, he\r\n  liveth as an asse. And yif he be light and unstedefast of corage, and\r\n  chaungeth ay his studies, he is lykned to briddes. And if he be\r\n  plounged in foule and unclene luxuries, he is with-holden in the       85\r\n  foule delyces of the foule sowe. Thanne folweth it, that he that\r\n      forleteth\r\n  bountee and prowesse, he forleteth to ben a man; sin he may\r\n  nat passen in-to the condicioun of god, he is torned in-to a beest.\r\n\r\nPR.

But I\r\n  nolde nat of shrewes, of which the thought cruel woodeth al-wey         5\r\n  in-to destruccioun of goode men, that it were leveful to hem to\r\n  don that.'\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod she, 'ne is nis nat leveful to hem, as I shal wel\r\n  shewe thee in covenable place; but natheles, yif so were that thilke\r\n  that men wenen be leveful to shrewes were binomen hem, _so that        10\r\n  they ne mighte nat anoyen or doon harm to goode men_, certes, a\r\n  greet partye of the peyne to shrewes sholde ben allegged and\r\n  releved. For al-be-it so that this ne seme nat credible thing,\r\n  per-aventure, to some folk, yit moot it nedes be, that shrewes ben\r\n  more wrecches and unsely whan they may doon and performe               15\r\n  that they coveiten, than yif they mighte nat complisshen that they\r\n  coveiten. For yif so be that it be wrecchednesse to wilne to don\r\n  yvel, than is more wrecchednesse to mowen don yvel; with-oute\r\n  whiche mowinge the wrecched wil sholde languisshe with-oute\r\n  effect. Than, sin that everiche of thise thinges hath his              20\r\n  wrecchednesse, _that is to seyn, wil to don yvel and mowinge to don\r\n  yvel_, it moot nedes be that they ben constreyned by three\r\n  unselinesses, that wolen and mowen and performen felonyes and\r\n  shrewednesses.'\r\n\r\n  'I acorde me,' quod I; 'but I desire gretly that shrewes               25\r\n  losten sone thilke unselinesse, _that is to seyn_, that shrewes weren\r\n  despoyled of mowinge to don yvel.'\r\n\r\n  'So shullen they,' quod she, 'soner, per-aventure, than thou\r\n  woldest; or soner than they hem-self wene to lakken _mowinge to\r\n  don yvel_. For ther nis no-thing so late in so shorte boundes of       30\r\n  this lyf, that is long to abyde, nameliche, to a corage inmortel;\r\n  of whiche shrewes the grete hope, and the hye compassinges of\r\n  shrewednesses, is ofte destroyed by a sodeyn ende, or they ben\r\n  war; and that thing estableth to shrewes the ende of hir\r\n  shrewednesse. For yif that shrewednesse maketh wrecches, than          35\r\n  mot he nedes ben most wrecched that lengest is a shrewe; the\r\n  whiche wikked shrewes wolde I demen aldermost unsely and caitifs,\r\n  yif that hir shrewednesse ne were finisshed, at the leste wey, by\r\n  the outtereste deeth. For yif I have concluded sooth of the unselinesse\r\n  of shrewednesse, than sheweth it cleerly that thilke                   40\r\n  wrecchednesse is with-outen ende, the whiche is certein to ben\r\n  perdurable.'\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod I, 'this conclusioun is hard and wonderful to\r\n  graunte; but I knowe wel that it acordeth moche to the thinges\r\n  that I have graunted her-biforn.'                                      45\r\n\r\n  'Thou hast,' quod she, 'the right estimacioun of this; but\r\n  who-so-ever wene that it be a hard thing to acorde him to a\r\n  conclusioun, it is right that he shewe that some of the premisses\r\n  ben false; or elles he moot shewe that the collacioun of proposiciouns\r\n  nis nat speedful to a necessarie conclusioun. And yif it               50\r\n  be nat so, but that the premisses ben y-graunted, ther is not why\r\n  he sholde blame the argument.\r\n\r\n  For this thing that I shal telle thee now ne shal nat seme lasse\r\n  wonderful; but of the thinges that ben taken also it is necessarie;'\r\n  _as who seyth, it folweth of that which that is purposed biforn_.      55\r\n\r\n  'What is that?' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod she, 'that is, that thise wikked shrewes ben\r\n  more blisful, _or elles lasse wrecches_, that abyen the torments that\r\n  they han deserved, than yif no peyne of Iustice ne chastysede\r\n  hem. Ne this ne seye I nat now, for that any man mighte                60\r\n  thenke, that the maners of shrewes ben coriged and chastysed by\r\n  veniaunce, and that they ben brought to the right wey by the\r\n  drede of the torment, ne for that they yeven to other folk\r\n  ensaumple to fleen fro vyces; but I understande yit in another\r\n  manere, that shrewes ben more unsely whan they ne ben nat              65\r\n  punisshed, al-be-it so that ther ne be had no resoun or lawe of\r\n  correccioun, ne non ensaumple of lokinge.'\r\n\r\n  'And what manere shal that ben,' quod I, 'other than hath be\r\n  told her-biforn?'\r\n\r\n  'Have we nat thanne graunted,' quod she, 'that goode folk              70\r\n  ben blisful, and shrewes ben wrecches?'\r\n\r\n  'Yis,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Thanne,' quod she, 'yif that any good were added to the\r\n  wrecchednesse of any wight, nis he nat more weleful than he that\r\n  ne hath no medlinge of good in his solitarie wrecchednesse?'           75\r\n\r\n  'So semeth it,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'And what seystow thanne,' quod she, 'of thilke wrecche that\r\n  lakketh alle goodes, _so that no good nis medled in his wrecchednesse_,\r\n  and yit, over al his wikkednesse for which he is a wrecche, that\r\n  ther be yit another yvel anexed and knit to him, shal nat men          80\r\n  demen him more unsely than thilke wrecche of whiche the unselinesse\r\n  is releved by the participacioun of som good?'\r\n\r\n  'Why sholde he nat?' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Thanne, certes,' quod she, 'han shrewes, whan they ben\r\n  punisshed, som-what of good anexed to hir wrecchednesse, that is       85\r\n  to seyn, the same peyne that they suffren, which that is good by\r\n  the resoun of Iustice; and whan thilke same shrewes ascapen\r\n  with-oute torment, than han they som-what more of yvel yit over\r\n  the wikkednesse that they han don, _that is to seyn_, defaute of\r\n  peyne; which defaute of peyne, thou hast graunted, is yvel for         90\r\n  the deserte of felonye.' 'I ne may nat denye it,' quod I. 'Moche\r\n  more thanne,' quod she, 'ben shrewes unsely, whan they ben\r\n  wrongfully delivered fro peyne, than whan they ben punisshed by\r\n  rightful veniaunce. But this is open thing and cleer, that it is\r\n  right that shrewes ben punisshed, and it is wikkednesse and            95\r\n  wrong that they escapen unpunisshed.'\r\n\r\n  'Who mighte deneye that?' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'But,' quod she, 'may any man denye that al that is right nis\r\n  good; and also the contrarie, that al that is wrong is wikke?'\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod I, 'these thinges ben clere y-nough; and that          100\r\n  we han concluded a litel her-biforn. But I praye thee that thou\r\n  telle me, yif thou acordest to leten no torment to sowles, after that\r\n  the body is ended by the deeth;' _this is to seyn, understandestow\r\n  aught that sowles han any torment after the deeth of the body?_\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod she, 'ye; and that right greet; of which sowles,'      105\r\n  quod she, 'I trowe that some ben tormented by asprenesse of\r\n  peyne; and some sowles, I trowe, ben exercised by a purginge\r\n  mekenesse. But my conseil nis nat to determinye of thise peynes.\r\n  But I have travailed and told yit hiderto, for thou sholdest knowe\r\n  that the mowinge of shrewes, which mowinge thee semeth to ben         110\r\n  unworthy, nis no mowinge: and eek of shrewes, of which thou\r\n  pleinedest that they ne were nat punisshed, that thou woldest\r\n  seen that they ne weren never-mo with-outen the torments of hir\r\n  wikkednesse: and of the licence _of the mowinge to don yvel_,\r\n  that thou preydest that it mighte sone ben ended, and that thou       115\r\n  woldest fayn lernen that it ne sholde nat longe dure: and that\r\n  shrewes ben more unsely yif they were of lenger duringe, and\r\n  most unsely yif they weren perdurable. And after this, I have\r\n  shewed thee that more unsely ben shrewes, whan they escapen\r\n  with-oute hir rightful peyne, than whan they ben punisshed by         120\r\n  rightful veniaunce. And of this sentence folweth it, that thanne\r\n  ben shrewes constreined at the laste with most grevous torment,\r\n  whan men wene that they ne be nat punisshed.'\r\n\r\n  'Whan I consider thy resouns,' quod I, 'I ne trowe nat that\r\n  men seyn any-thing more verayly. And yif I torne ayein to the         125\r\n  studies of men, who is he to whom it sholde seme that he ne\r\n  sholde nat only leven thise thinges, but eek gladly herkne\r\n  hem?'\r\n\r\n  'Certes,' quod she, 'so it is; but men may nat. For they han\r\n  hir eyen so wont to the derknesse _of erthely thinges_, that they ne  130\r\n  may nat liften hem up to the light of cleer sothfastnesse; but\r\n  they ben lyke to briddes, of which the night lightneth hir lokinge,\r\n  and the day blindeth hem. For whan men loken nat the ordre of\r\n  thinges, but hir lustes and talents, they wene that either the leve\r\n  or the mowinge to don wikkednesse, or elles the scapinge with-oute    135\r\n  peyne, be weleful. But consider the Iugement of the\r\n  perdurable lawe. For yif thou conferme thy corage to the beste\r\n  thinges, thou ne hast no nede of no Iuge to yeven thee prys or\r\n  mede; for thou hast ioyned thy-self to the most excellent thing.\r\n  And yif thou have enclyned thy studies to the wikked thinges, ne      140\r\n  seek no foreyne wreker out of thy-self; for thou thy-self hast\r\n  thrist thy-self in-to wikke thinges: right as thou mightest loken by\r\n  dyverse tymes the foule erthe and the hevene, and that alle other\r\n  thinges stinten fro with-oute, _so that thou nere neither in hevene\r\n  ne in erthe, ne saye no-thing more_; than it sholde semen to          145\r\n  thee, as by only resoun of lokinge, that thou were now in the\r\n  sterres and now in the erthe. But the poeple ne loketh nat on\r\n  thise thinges. What thanne? Shal we thanne aprochen us to\r\n  hem that I have shewed that they ben lyk to bestes? And what\r\n  woltow seyn of this: yif that a man hadde al forlorn his sighte       150\r\n  and hadde foryeten that he ever saugh, and wende that no-thing\r\n  ne faylede him of perfeccioun of mankinde, now we that mighten\r\n  seen the same thinges, wolde we nat wene that he were blinde?\r\n  Ne also ne acordeth nat the poeple to that I shal seyn, the which\r\n  thing is sustened by a stronge foundement of resouns, _that is to_    155\r\n  _seyn_, that more unsely ben they that don wrong to othre folk\r\n  than they that the wrong suffren.'\r\n\r\n  'I wolde heren thilke same resouns,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Denyestow,' quod she, 'that alle shrewes ne ben worthy to\r\n  han torment?'                                                         160\r\n\r\n  'Nay,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'But,' quod she, 'I am certein, by many resouns, that shrewes\r\n  ben unsely.'\r\n\r\n  'It acordeth,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Thanne ne doutestow nat,' quod she, 'that thilke folk that ben       165\r\n  worthy of torment, that they ne ben wrecches?'\r\n\r\n  'It acordeth wel,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Yif thou were thanne,' quod she, 'y-set a Iuge or a knower of\r\n  thinges, whether, trowestow, that men sholden tormenten him\r\n  that hath don the wrong, or elles him that hath suffred the           170\r\n  wrong?'\r\n\r\n  'I ne doute nat,' quod I, 'that I nolde don suffisaunt satisfaccioun\r\n  to him that hadde suffred the wrong by the sorwe of him\r\n  that hadde don the wrong.'\r\n\r\n  'Thanne semeth it,' quod she, 'that the doere of wrong is             175\r\n  more wrecche than he that suffred wrong?'\r\n\r\n  'That folweth wel,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  'Than,' quod she, 'by these causes and by othre causes that\r\n  ben enforced by the same rote, filthe or sinne, by the propre\r\n  nature of it, maketh men wrecches; and it sheweth wel, that the       180\r\n  wrong that men don nis nat the wrecchednesse of him that\r\n  receyveth the wrong, but the wrecchednesse of him that doth the\r\n  wrong. But certes,' quod she, 'thise oratours or advocats don al\r\n  the contrarye; for they enforcen hem to commoeve the Iuges to\r\n  han pitee of hem that han suffred and receyved the thinges that       185\r\n  ben grevous and aspre, and yit men sholden more rightfully han\r\n  pitee of hem that don the grevaunces and the wronges; the\r\n  whiche shrewes, it were a more covenable thing, that the\r\n  accusours or advocats, nat wroth but pitous and debonair, ledden\r\n  tho shrewes that han don wrong to the Iugement, right as men          190\r\n  leden syke folk to the leche, for that they sholde seken out the\r\n  maladyes of sinne by torment. And by this covenaunt, either the\r\n  entente of deffendours or advocats sholde faylen and cesen in al,\r\n  or elles, yif the office of advocats wolde bettre profiten to men,\r\n  it sholde ben torned in-to the habite of accusacioun; _that is to     195\r\n  seyn, they sholden accuse shrewes, and nat excuse hem_. And eek\r\n  the shrewes hem-self, yif hit were leveful to hem to seen at any\r\n  clifte the vertu that they han forleten, and sawen that they\r\n  sholden putten adoun the filthes of hir vyces, by the torments of\r\n  peynes, they ne oughte nat, right for the recompensacioun for to      200\r\n  geten hem bountee and prowesse which that they han lost,\r\n  demen ne holden that thilke peynes weren torments to hem; and\r\n  eek they wolden refuse the attendaunce of hir advocats, and\r\n  taken hem-self to hir Iuges and to hir accusors. For which it\r\n  bitydeth that, as to the wyse folk, ther nis no place y-leten to      205\r\n  hate; _that is to seyn, that ne hate hath no place amonges wyse men_.\r\n  For no wight nil haten goode men, but-yif he were over-mochel a\r\n  fool; and for to haten shrewes, it nis no resoun. For right so as\r\n  languissinge is maladye of body, right so ben vyces and sinne\r\n  maladye of corage. And so as we ne deme nat, that they that ben       210\r\n  syke of hir body ben worthy to ben hated, but rather worthy of\r\n  pitee: wel more worthy, nat to ben hated, but for to ben had in\r\n  pitee, ben they of whiche the thoughtes ben constreined by\r\n  felonous wikkednesse, that is more cruel than any languissinge of     215\r\n  body.\r\n\r\nPR.

The whiche thinges,\r\n  yif that any wight loketh wel in his thought the strengthe of that     40\r\n  oon and of that other, he shal lightly mowen seen, that thise two\r\n  thinges ben dyverse. For purviaunce is thilke divyne reson that\r\n  is establisshed in the soverein prince of thinges; the whiche purviaunce\r\n  disponeth alle thinges. But destinee is the disposicioun\r\n  and ordinaunce clyvinge to moevable thinges, by the whiche             45\r\n  disposicioun the purviaunce knitteth alle thinges in hir ordres;\r\n  for purviaunce embraceth alle thinges to-hepe, al-thogh that they\r\n  ben dyverse, and al-thogh they ben infinite; but destinee departeth\r\n  and ordeineth alle thinges singulerly, and divyded in\r\n  moevinges, in places, in formes, in tymes, as thus: lat the            50\r\n  unfoldinge of temporel ordinaunce, assembled and ooned in the\r\n  lokinge of the divyne thought, be cleped purviaunce; and thilke\r\n  same assemblinge and ooninge, divyded and unfolden by tymes,\r\n  lat that ben called destinee. And al-be-it so that thise thinges\r\n  ben dyverse, yit natheles hangeth that oon on that other; for-why      55\r\n  the order destinal procedeth of the simplicitee of purviaunce.\r\n  For right as a werkman, that aperceyveth in his thoght the forme\r\n  of the thing that he wol make, and moeveth the effect of the\r\n  werk, and ledeth that he hadde loked biforn in his thoght simply\r\n  and presently, by temporel ordinaunce: certes, right so god            60\r\n  disponeth in his purviaunce, singulerly and stably, the thinges\r\n  that ben to done, but he aministreth in many maneres and in\r\n  dyverse tymes, by destinee, thilke same thinges that he hath\r\n  disponed.\r\n\r\n  Thanne, whether that destinee be exercysed outher by some              65\r\n  divyne spirits, servaunts to the divyne purviaunce, or elles by\r\n  som sowle, or elles by alle nature servinge to god, or elles by the\r\n  celestial moevinges of sterres, or elles by the vertu of angeles, or\r\n  elles by the dyverse subtilitee of develes, or elles by any of hem,\r\n  or elles by hem alle, the destinal ordinaunce is y-woven and           70\r\n  acomplisshed. Certes, it is open thing, that the purviaunce is\r\n  an unmoevable and simple forme of thinges to done; and the\r\n  moveable bond and the temporel ordinaunce of thinges, whiche\r\n  that the divyne simplicitee of purviaunce hath ordeyned to done,\r\n  that is destinee. For which it is, that alle thinges that ben put      75\r\n  under destinee ben, certes, subgits to purviaunce, to whiche purviaunce\r\n  destinee itself is subgit and under. But some thinges\r\n  ben put under purviaunce, that surmounten the ordinaunce of\r\n  destinee; and tho ben thilke that stably ben y-ficched negh to the\r\n  firste godhed: they surmounten the ordre of destinal moevabletee.      80\r\n  For right as of cercles that tornen a-boute a same centre or a-boute\r\n  a poynt, thilke cercle that is innerest or most with-inne ioyneth to\r\n  the simplesse of the middel, and is, as it were, a centre or a poynt\r\n  to that other cercles that tornen a-bouten him; and thilke that is\r\n  outterest, compassed by larger envyronninge, is unfolden by            85\r\n  larger spaces, in so moche as it is forthest fro the middel simplicitee\r\n  of the poynt; and yif ther be any-thing that knitteth and\r\n  felawshippeth him-self to thilke middel poynt, it is constreined\r\n  in-to simplicitee, _that is to seyn, in-to unmoevabletee_, and it ceseth\r\n  to be shad and to fleten dyversely: right so, by semblable resoun,     90\r\n  thilke thing that departeth forthest fro the first thoght of god, it is\r\n  unfolden and summitted to gretter bondes of destinee: and in so\r\n  moche is the thing more free and laus fro destinee, as it axeth and\r\n  holdeth him ner to thilke centre of thinges, _that is to seyn, god_.\r\n  And yif the thing clyveth to the stedefastnesse of the thoght of god,  95\r\n  and be with-oute moevinge, certes, it sormounteth the necessitee of\r\n  destinee. Thanne right swich comparisoun as it is of skilinge to\r\n  understondinge, and of thing that is engendred to thing that is, and\r\n  of tyme to eternitee, and of the cercle to the centre, right so is the\r\n  ordre of moevable destinee to the stable simplicitee of purviaunce.   100\r\n\r\n  Thilke ordinaunce moeveth the hevene and the sterres, and\r\n  atempreth the elements to-gider amonges hem-self, and transformeth\r\n  hem by entrechaungeable mutacioun; and thilke same\r\n  ordre neweth ayein alle thinges growinge and fallinge a-doun, by\r\n  semblable progressiouns of sedes and of sexes, _that is to seyn,      105\r\n  male and femele_. And this ilke ordre constreineth the fortunes and\r\n  the dedes of men by a bond of causes, nat able to ben unbounde;\r\n  the whiche destinal causes, whan they passen out fro the biginninges\r\n  of the unmoevable purviaunce, it mot nedes be that they\r\n  ne be nat mutable. And thus ben the thinges ful wel y-governed,       110\r\n  yif that the simplicitee dwellinge in the divyne thoght sheweth\r\n  forth the ordre of causes, unable to ben y-bowed; and this ordre\r\n  constreineth by his propre stabletee the moevable thinges, or elles\r\n  they sholden fleten folily. For which it is, that alle thinges semen\r\n  to ben confus and trouble to us men, for we ne mowen nat considere    115\r\n  thilke ordinaunce; natheles, the propre maner of every\r\n  thinge, dressinge hem to goode, disponeth hem alle.\r\n\r\n  For ther nis no-thing don for cause of yvel; ne thilke thing\r\n  that is don by wikkede folk _nis nat don for yvel_. The whiche\r\n  shrewes, as I have shewed ful plentivously, seken good, but           120\r\n  wikked errour mistorneth hem, ne the ordre cominge fro the\r\n  poynt of soverein good ne declyneth nat fro his biginninge. But\r\n  thou mayst seyn, what unreste may ben a worse confusioun than\r\n  that gode men han somtyme adversitee and somtyme prosperitee,\r\n  and shrewes also now han thinges that they desiren, and now           125\r\n  thinges that they haten? Whether men liven now in swich\r\n  hoolnesse of thoght, (_as who seyth, ben men now so wyse_), that\r\n  swiche folk as they demen to ben gode folk or shrewes, that\r\n  it moste nedes ben that folk ben swiche as they wenen? But in\r\n  this manere the domes of men discorden, that thilke men that          130\r\n  some folk demen worthy of mede, other folk demen hem worthy of\r\n  torment. But lat us graunte, I pose that som man may wel demen\r\n  or knowen the gode folk and the badde; may he thanne knowen\r\n  and seen thilke innereste atempraunce of corages, as it hath ben\r\n  wont to be seyd of bodies; _as who seyth, may a man speken and        135\r\n  determinen of atempraunces in corages, as men were wont to demen or\r\n  speken of complexiouns and atempraunces of bodies?_ Ne it ne is nat\r\n  an unlyk miracle, to hem that ne knowen it nat, (_as who seith, but it\r\n  is lyke a merveil or a miracle to hem that ne knowen it nat_), why that\r\n  swete thinges ben covenable to some bodies that ben hole, and to      140\r\n  some bodies bittere thinges ben covenable; and also, why that\r\n  some syke folk ben holpen with lighte medicynes, and some folk\r\n  ben holpen with sharpe medicynes. But natheles, the leche that\r\n  knoweth the manere and the atempraunce of hele and of maladye,\r\n  ne merveileth of it no-thing. But what other thing semeth hele        145\r\n  of corages but bountee and prowesse? And what other thing\r\n  semeth maladye _of corages_ but vyces? Who is elles kepere of\r\n  good or dryver awey of yvel, but god, governour and lecher of\r\n  thoughtes? The whiche god, whan he hath biholden from the\r\n  heye tour of his purveaunce, he knoweth what is covenable to          150\r\n  every wight, and leneth hem that he wot that is covenable to hem.\r\n  Lo, her-of comth and her-of is don this noble miracle of the ordre\r\n  destinal, whan god, that al knoweth, doth swiche thing, of which\r\n  thing that unknowinge folk ben astoned. But for to constreine,\r\n  _as who seyth, but for to comprehende and telle_ a fewe thinges of\r\n      the                                                               155\r\n  divyne deepnesse, the whiche that mannes resoun may understonde,\r\n  thilke man that thou wenest to ben right Iuste and right\r\n  kepinge of equitee, the contrarie of that semeth to the divyne\r\n  purveaunce, that al wot. And Lucan, my familer, telleth that\r\n  \"the victorious cause lykede to the goddes, and the cause over-comen  160\r\n  lykede to Catoun.\" Thanne, what-so-ever thou mayst seen\r\n  that is don in this werld unhoped or unwened, certes, it is the\r\n  right ordre of thinges; but, as to thy wikkede opinioun, it is a\r\n  confusioun. But I suppose that som man be so wel y-thewed,\r\n  that the divyne Iugement and the Iugement of mankinde acorden         165\r\n  hem to-gider of him; but he is so unstedefast of corage, that, yif\r\n  any adversitee come to him, he wol forleten, par-aventure, to\r\n  continue innocence, by the whiche he ne may nat with-holden\r\n  fortune. Thanne the wyse dispensacioun of god spareth him, the\r\n  whiche man adversitee mighte enpeyren; for that god wol nat           170\r\n  suffren him to travaile, to whom that travaile nis nat covenable.\r\n  Another man is parfit in alle vertues, and is an holy man, and\r\n  negh to god, so that the purviaunce of god wolde demen, that\r\n  it were a felonye that he were touched with any adversitees; so\r\n  that he wol nat suffre that swich a man be moeved with any            175\r\n  bodily maladye. But so as seyde a philosophre, the more excellent\r\n  by me: _he seyde in Grek_, that \"vertues han edified the body\r\n  of the holy man.\" And ofte tyme it bitydeth, that the somme of\r\n  thinges that ben to done is taken to governe to gode folk, for that\r\n  the malice haboundaunt of shrewes sholde ben abated. And god          180\r\n  yeveth and departeth to othre folk prosperitees and adversitees\r\n  y-medled to-hepe, after the qualitee of hir corages, and remordeth\r\n  som folk _by adversitee_, for they ne sholde nat wexen proude by\r\n  longe welefulnesse. And other folk he suffreth to ben travailed\r\n  with harde thinges, for that they sholden confermen the vertues       185\r\n  of corage by the usage and exercitacioun of pacience. And\r\n  other folk dreden more than they oughten [that] whiche they\r\n  mighten wel beren; and somme dispyse that they mowe nat\r\n  beren; and thilke folk god ledeth in-to experience of himself by\r\n  aspre and sorwful thinges. And many othre folk han bought             190\r\n  honourable renoun of this world by the prys of glorious deeth.\r\n  And som men, that ne mowen nat ben overcomen by torments,\r\n  have yeven ensaumple to othre folk, that vertu may nat ben overcomen\r\n  by adversitees; and of alle thinges ther nis no doute, that\r\n  they ne ben don rightfully and ordenely, to the profit of hem to      195\r\n  whom we seen thise thinges bityde. For certes, that adversitee\r\n  comth somtyme to shrewes, and somtyme that that they desiren,\r\n  it comth of thise forseide causes. And of sorwful thinges _that\r\n  bityden to shrewes_, certes, no man ne wondreth; for alle men\r\n  wenen that they han wel deserved it, and that they ben of             200\r\n  wikkede merite; of whiche shrewes the torment somtyme agasteth\r\n  othre to don felonyes, and somtyme it amendeth hem that suffren\r\n  the torments. And the prosperitee _that is yeven to shrewes_\r\n  sheweth a greet argument to gode folk, what thing they sholde\r\n  demen of thilke welefulnesse, the whiche prosperitee men seen         205\r\n  ofte serven to shrewes. In the which thing I trowe that god\r\n  dispenseth; for, per-aventure, the nature of som man is so overthrowinge\r\n  _to yvel_, and so uncovenable, that the nedy povertee of\r\n  his houshold mighte rather egren him to don felonyes. And to\r\n  the maladye of him god putteth remedie, to yeven him richesses.       210\r\n  And som other man biholdeth his conscience defouled with sinnes,\r\n  and maketh comparisoun of his fortune and of him-self; and\r\n  dredeth, per-aventure, that his blisfulnesse, of which the usage is\r\n  Ioyeful to him, that the lesinge of thilke blisfulnesse ne be nat\r\n  sorwful to him; and therfor he wol chaunge his maneres, and, for      215\r\n  he dredeth to lese his fortune, he forleteth his wikkednesse. To\r\n  othre folk is welefulnesse y-yeven unworthily, the whiche overthroweth\r\n  hem in-to distruccioun that they han deserved. And to\r\n  som othre folk is yeven power to punisshen, for that it shal be\r\n  cause of _continuacioun and_ exercysinge to gode folk and cause of    220\r\n  torment to shrewes. For so as ther nis non alyaunce by-twixe\r\n  gode folk and shrewes, ne shrewes ne mowen nat acorden amonges\r\n  hem-self. And why nat? For shrewes discorden of hem-self by\r\n  hir vyces, the whiche vyces al to-renden hir consciences; and don\r\n  ofte tyme thinges, the whiche thinges, whan they han don hem,         225\r\n  they demen that tho thinges ne sholden nat han ben don. For\r\n  which thing thilke soverein purveaunce hath maked ofte tyme fair\r\n  miracle; so that shrewes han maked shrewes to ben gode men.\r\n  For whan that som shrewes seen that they suffren wrongfully\r\n  felonyes of othre shrewes, they wexen eschaufed in-to hate of hem     230\r\n  that anoyeden hem, and retornen to the frut of vertu, whan they\r\n  studien to ben unlyk to hem that they han hated. Certes, only\r\n  this is the divyne might, to the whiche might yveles ben thanne\r\n  gode, whan it useth tho yveles covenably, and draweth out the\r\n  effect of any gode; _as who seyth, that yvel is good only to the\r\n      might                                                             235\r\n  of god, for the might of god ordeyneth thilke yvel to good_.\r\n\r\n  For oon ordre embraseth alle thinges, so that what wight that\r\n  departeth fro the resoun of thilke ordre which that is assigned to\r\n  him, algates yit he slydeth in-to another ordre, so that no-thing\r\n  nis leveful to folye in the reame of the divyne purviaunce; _as who   240\r\n  seyth, nothing nis with-outen ordinaunce in the reame of the divyne\r\n  purviaunce_; sin that the right stronge god governeth alle thinges\r\n  in this world. For it nis nat leveful to man to comprehenden by\r\n  wit, ne unfolden by word, alle the subtil ordinaunces and disposiciouns\r\n  of the divyne entente. For only it oughte suffise to                  245\r\n  han loked, that god him-self, maker of alle natures, ordeineth and\r\n  dresseth alle thinges to gode; whyl that he hasteth to with-holden\r\n  the thinges that he hath maked in-to his semblaunce, _that is to\r\n  seyn, for to with-holden thinges in-to good, for he him-self is good_,\r\n  he chaseth out al yvel fro the boundes of his comunalitee by the      250\r\n  ordre of necessitee destinable. For which it folweth, that yif thou\r\n  loke the purviaunce ordeininge the thinges that men wenen ben\r\n  outrageous or haboundant in erthes, thou ne shalt nat seen in no\r\n  place no-thing of yvel.

For yif so be that god loketh alle thinges biforn, ne\r\n  god ne may nat ben desseived in no manere, than mot it nedes\r\n  been, that alle thinges bityden the whiche that the purviaunce of\r\n  god hath seyn biforn to comen. For which, yif that god                 10\r\n  knoweth biforn nat only the werkes of men, but also hir conseiles\r\n  and hir willes, thanne ne shal ther be no libertee of arbitre; ne,\r\n  certes, ther ne may be noon other dede, ne no wil, but thilke\r\n  which that the divyne purviaunce, that may nat ben desseived,\r\n  hath feled biforn. For yif that they mighten wrythen awey in           15\r\n  othre manere than they ben purveyed, than sholde ther be no\r\n  stedefast prescience of thing to comen, but rather an uncertein\r\n  opinioun; the whiche thing to trowen of god, I deme it felonye\r\n  and unleveful. Ne I ne proeve nat thilke same resoun, _as who\r\n  seyth, I ne alowe nat, or I ne preyse nat, thilke same resoun_, by     20\r\n  which that som men wenen that they mowen assoilen and\r\n  unknitten the knotte of this questioun. For, certes, they seyn\r\n  that thing nis nat to comen for that the purviaunce of god hath\r\n  seyn it biforn that is to comen, but rather the contrarye, _and that\r\n  is this_: that, for that the thing is to comen, therfore ne may it     25\r\n  nat ben hid fro the purviaunce of god; and in this manere this\r\n  necessitee slydeth ayein in-to the contrarye partye: ne it ne\r\n  bihoveth nat, nedes, that thinges bityden that ben purvyed, but\r\n  it bihoveth, nedes, that thinges that ben to comen ben y-porveyed:\r\n  but as it were y-travailed, _as who seyth, that thilke answere_        30\r\n  _procedeth right as thogh men travaileden, or weren bisy to enqueren_,\r\n  the whiche thing is cause of the whiche thing:--as, whether the\r\n  prescience is cause of the necessitee of thinges to comen, or elles\r\n  that the necessitee of thinges to comen is cause of the purviaunce.\r\n  But I ne enforce me nat now to shewen it, that the bitydinge of        35\r\n  thinges y-wist biforn is necessarie, how so or in what manere\r\n  that the ordre of causes hath it-self; al-thogh that it ne seme nat\r\n  that the prescience bringe in necessitee of bitydinge to thinges to\r\n  comen. For certes, yif that any wight sitteth, it bihoveth by\r\n  necessitee that the opinioun be sooth of him that coniecteth that      40\r\n  he sitteth; and ayeinward also is it of the contrarye: yif the\r\n  opinioun be sooth of any wight for that he sitteth, it bihoveth by\r\n  necessitee that he sitte. Thanne is heer necessitee in that oon\r\n  and in that other: for in that oon is necessitee of sittinge, and,\r\n  certes, in that other is necessitee of sooth. But therfore ne          45\r\n  sitteth nat a wight, for that the opinioun of the sittinge is sooth;\r\n  but the opinioun is rather sooth, for that a wight sitteth biforn.\r\n  And thus, al-thogh that the cause of the sooth cometh of that\r\n  other syde (_as who seyth, that al-thogh the cause of sooth comth_\r\n  _of the sitting, and nat of the trewe opinioun_), algates yit is ther  50\r\n  comune necessitee in that oon and in that other. Thus sheweth\r\n  it, that I may make semblable skiles of the purviaunce of god\r\n  and of thinges to comen. For althogh that, for that thinges ben\r\n  to comen, ther-fore ben they purveyed, nat, certes, for that they\r\n  ben purveyed, ther-fore ne bityde they nat. Yit natheles,              55\r\n  bihoveth it by necessitee, that either the thinges to comen ben\r\n  y-purveyed of god, or elles that the thinges that ben purveyed of\r\n  god bityden. And this thing only suffiseth y-nough to destroyen\r\n  the freedom of oure arbitre, _that is to seyn, of oure free wil_. But\r\n  now, certes, _sheweth it wel, how fer fro the sothe and_ how\r\n      up-so-doun                                                         60\r\n  is this thing that we seyn, that the bitydinge of temporel\r\n  thinges is cause of the eterne prescience. But for to wenen that\r\n  god purvyeth the thinges to comen for they ben to comen, what\r\n  other thing is it but for to wene that thilke thinges that bitidden\r\n  whylom ben causes of thilke soverein purvyaunce _that is in god_?      65\r\n  And her-to _I adde yit this thing_: that, right as whan that I wot\r\n  that a thing is, it bihoveth by necessitee that thilke selve thing be;\r\n  and eek, whan I have knowe that any thing shal bityden, so\r\n  byhoveth it by necessitee that thilke thing bityde:--so folweth it\r\n  thanne, that the bitydinge of the thing y-wist biforn ne may nat       70\r\n  ben eschued. And at the laste, yif that any wight wene a thing\r\n  to ben other weyes thanne it is, it is nat only unscience, but it is\r\n  deceivable opinioun ful diverse and fer fro the sothe of science.\r\n  Wherfore, yif any thing be so to comen, that the bitydinge of hit\r\n  ne be nat certein ne necessarie, who may weten biforn that thilke      75\r\n  thing is to comen? For right as science ne may nat ben medled\r\n  with falsnesse (_as who seyth, that yif I wot a thing, it ne may nat\r\n  be false that I ne wot it_), right so thilke thing that is conceived by\r\n  science ne may nat ben non other weys than as it is conceived.\r\n  For that is the cause why that science wanteth lesing (_as who_        80\r\n  _seyth, why that witinge ne receiveth nat lesinge of that it wot_); for\r\n  it bihoveth, by necessitee, that every thing be right as science\r\n  comprehendeth it to be. What shal I thanne seyn? In whiche\r\n  manere knoweth god biforn the thinges to comen, yif they ne be\r\n  nat certein? For yif that he deme that they ben to comen               85\r\n  uneschewably, and so may be that it is possible that they ne\r\n  shollen nat comen, god is deceived. But nat only to trowen that\r\n  god is deceived, but for to speke it with mouth, it is a felonous\r\n  sinne. But yif that god wot that, right so as thinges ben _to\r\n  comen_, so shullen they comen--so that he wite egaly, _as who_         90\r\n  _seyth, indifferently_, that thinges mowen ben doon or elles nat\r\n  y-doon--what is thilke prescience that ne comprehendeth no\r\n  certein thing ne stable? Or elles what difference is ther bitwixe\r\n  the prescience and thilke Iape-worthy divyninge of Tiresie the\r\n  divynour, _that seyde_: \"Al that I seye,\" quod he, \"either it shal be, 95\r\n  or elles it ne shal nat be?\" Or elles how mochel is worth the\r\n  devyne prescience more than the opinioun of mankinde, yif so be\r\n  that it demeth the thinges uncertein, as men doon; of the whiche\r\n  domes of men the bitydinge nis nat certein? But yif so be that\r\n  non uncertein thing ne may ben in him that is right certein welle     100\r\n  of alle thinges, thanne is the bitydinge certein of thilke thinges\r\n  whiche he hath wist biforn fermely to comen. For which it\r\n  folweth, that the freedom of the conseiles and of the werkes of\r\n  mankind nis non, sin that the thoght of god, that seeth alle\r\n  thinges without errour of falsnesse, bindeth and constreineth         105\r\n  hem to a bitydinge _by necessitee_. And yif this thing be ones\r\n  y-graunted and received, _that is to seyn, that ther nis no free wille_,\r\n  than sheweth it wel, how greet destruccioun and how grete\r\n  damages ther folwen of thinges of mankinde. For in ydel ben\r\n  ther thanne purposed and bihight medes to gode folk, and peynes       110\r\n  to badde folk, sin that no moevinge of free corage voluntarie ne\r\n  hath nat deserved hem, _that is to seyn, neither mede ne peyne_; and\r\n  it sholde seme thanne, that thilke thing is alderworst, which that\r\n  is now demed for aldermost iust and most rightful, _that is to seyn_,\r\n  that shrewes ben punisshed, or elles that gode folk ben y-gerdoned:   115\r\n  the whiche folk, sin that hir propre wil ne sent hem nat to that oon\r\n  ne to that other, _that is to seyn, neither to gode ne to harm_, but\r\n      constreineth\r\n  hem certein necessitee of thinges to comen: thanne ne\r\n  shollen ther nevere ben, ne nevere weren, vyce ne vertu, but it\r\n  sholde rather ben confusioun of alle desertes medled with-outen       120\r\n  discrecioun. And yit _ther folweth an-other inconvenient_, of the\r\n  whiche ther ne may ben thoght no more felonous ne more wikke;\r\n  _and that is this_: that, so as the ordre of thinges is y-led and\r\n  comth of the purviaunce of god, ne that no-thing nis leveful to\r\n  the conseiles of mankinde (_as who seyth, that men han no power to    125\r\n  doon no-thing, ne wilne no-thing_), than folweth it, that oure vyces\r\n  ben referred to the maker of alle good (_as who seyth, than folweth\r\n  it, that god oughte han the blame of oure vyces, sin he constreineth us\r\n  by necessitee to doon vyces_). Thanne is ther no resoun to hopen _in\r\n  god_, ne for to preyen _to god_; for what sholde any wight hopen _to_ 130\r\n  _god_, or why sholde he preyen _to god_, sin that the ordenaunce of\r\n  destinee, which that ne may nat ben inclyned, knitteth and streineth\r\n  alle thinges that men may desiren? Thanne sholde ther be doon\r\n  awey thilke only allyaunce bitwixen god and men, that is to seyn,\r\n  to hopen and to preyen. But by the prys of rightwisnesse and of       135\r\n  verray mekenesse we deserven the gerdoun of the divyne grace,\r\n  which that is inestimable, _that is to seyn, that it is so greet, that it\r\n  ne may nat ben ful y-preysed_. And this is only the manere, _that is\r\n  to seyn, hope and preyeres_, for which it semeth that men mowen\r\n  speke with god, and by resoun of supplicacioun be conioined to        140\r\n  thilke cleernesse, that nis nat aproched no rather or that men\r\n  beseken it and impetren it.

Whiche god hath establisshed so greet bataile bitwixen\r\n  thise two soothfast or verray thinges, _that is to seyn,\r\n  bitwixen the purviaunce of god and free wil_, that they ben singuler    5\r\n  and devyded, ne that they ne wolen nat be medeled ne coupled\r\n  to-gidere?

And\r\n  the cause of this derkenesse and of this difficultee is, for that the\r\n  moevinge of the resoun of mankinde ne may nat moeven to (_that\r\n  is to seyn, applyen or ioinen to_) the simplicitee of the devyne\r\n  prescience; the whiche _simplicitee of the devyne prescience_, yif     10\r\n  that men mighten thinken it in any maner, _that is to seyn, that yif\r\n  men mighten thinken and comprehenden the thinges as god seeth\r\n  hem_, thanne ne sholde ther dwellen outrely no doute: the whiche\r\n  _resoun and cause of difficultee_ I shal assaye at the laste to shewe\r\n  and to speden, whan I have first y-spended and answered to tho         15\r\n  resouns by which thou art y-moeved. For I axe why thou wenest\r\n  that thilke resouns of hem that assoilen this questioun ne ben\r\n  nat speedful y-nough ne sufficient: the whiche _solucioun, or the\r\n  whiche resoun_, for that it demeth that the prescience nis nat cause\r\n  of necessitee to thinges to comen, than ne weneth it nat that          20\r\n  freedom of wil be destorbed or y-let by prescience. For ne\r\n  drawestow nat arguments from elles-where of the necessitee of\r\n  thinges to-comen (_as who seith, any other wey than thus_) but that\r\n  thilke thinges that the prescience wot biforn ne mowen nat unbityde?\r\n  _That is to seyn, that they moten bityde._ But thanne, yif             25\r\n  that prescience ne putteth no necessitee to thinges to comen, as\r\n  thou thy-self hast confessed it and biknowen a litel her-biforn, what\r\n  cause or what is it (_as who seith, ther may no cause be_) by which\r\n  that the endes voluntarie of thinges mighten be constreined to\r\n  certein bitydinge? For by grace of positioun, so that thou mowe        30\r\n  the betere understonde this that folweth, I pose, _per impossibile_,\r\n  that ther be no prescience. Thanne axe I,' quod she, 'in as\r\n  mochel as apertieneth to that, sholden thanne thinges that comen\r\n  of free wil ben constreined to bityden by necessitee?'\r\n\r\n  _Boece._ 'Nay,' quod I.                                                35\r\n\r\n  'Thanne ayeinward,' quod she, 'I suppose that ther be prescience,\r\n  but that it ne putteth no necessitee to thinges; thanne\r\n  trowe I, that thilke selve freedom of wil shal dwellen al hool and\r\n  absolut and unbounden. But thou wolt seyn that, al-be-it so that\r\n  prescience nis nat cause of the necessitee of bitydinge to thinges     40\r\n  to comen, algates yit it is a signe that the thinges ben to bityden\r\n  by necessitee. By this manere thanne, al-thogh the prescience\r\n  ne hadde never y-ben, yit _algate or at the leeste weye_ it is certein\r\n  thing, that the endes and bitydinges of thinges to comen sholden\r\n  ben necessarie. For every signe sheweth and signifyeth only what       45\r\n  the thing is, but it ne maketh nat the thing that it signifyeth. For\r\n  which it bihoveth first to shewen, that no-thing ne bitydeth that it\r\n  ne bitydeth by necessitee, so that it may appere that the prescience\r\n  is signe of this necessitee; or elles, yif ther nere no necessitee,\r\n  certes, thilke prescience ne mighte nat be signe of thing that nis     50\r\n  nat. But certes, it is now certein that the proeve of this,\r\n  y-sustened by stidefast resoun, ne shal nat ben lad ne proeved by\r\n  signes ne by arguments y-taken fro with-oute, but by causes\r\n  covenable and necessarie. But _thou mayst seyn_, how may it be\r\n  that the thinges ne bityden nat that ben y-purveyed to comen?          55\r\n  But, certes, right as we trowen that tho thinges which that the\r\n  purviance wot biforn to comen ne ben nat to bityden; but that\r\n  ne sholden we nat demen; but rather, al-thogh that they shal\r\n  bityden, yit ne have they no necessitee of hir kinde to bityden.\r\n  And this maystow lightly aperceiven by this that I shal seyn. For      60\r\n  we seen many thinges whan they ben don biforn oure eyen, right\r\n  as men seen the cartere worken in the torninge or atempringe or\r\n  adressinge of hise cartes or charietes. And by this manere (_as\r\n  who seith, maystow understonde_) of alle othere _workmen_. Is ther\r\n  thanne any necessitee, _as who seith, in oure lokinge_, that\r\n      constreineth                                                       65\r\n  or compelleth any of thilke thinges to ben don so?'\r\n\r\n  _Boece._ 'Nay,' quod I; 'for in ydel and in veyn were al the\r\n  effect of craft, yif that alle thinges weren moeved by constreininge;'\r\n  _that is to seyn, by constreininge of oure eyen or of oure sight_.\r\n\r\n  _Philosophie._ 'The thinges thanne,' quod she, 'that, whan men         70\r\n  doon hem, ne han no necessitee that men doon hem, eek tho\r\n  same thinges, first or they ben doon, they ben to comen with-oute\r\n  necessitee. For-why ther ben somme thinges to bityden, of which\r\n  the endes and the bitydinges of hem ben absolut and quit of alle\r\n  necessitee. For certes, I ne trowe nat that any man wolde seyn         75\r\n  this: that tho thinges that men doon now, that they ne weren to\r\n  bityden first or they weren y-doon; and thilke same thinges,\r\n  al-thogh that men had y-wist hem biforn, yit they han free\r\n  bitydinges. For right as science of thinges present ne bringeth in\r\n  no necessitee to thinges that men doon, right so the prescience of     80\r\n  thinges to comen ne bringeth in no necessitee to thinges to\r\n  bityden. But thou mayst seyn, that of thilke same it is y-douted,\r\n  as whether that of thilke thinges that ne han non issues and\r\n  bitydinges necessaries, yif ther-of may ben any prescience; for\r\n  certes, they semen to discorden. For thou wenest that, yif that        85\r\n  thinges ben y-seyn biforn, that necessitee folweth hem; and yif\r\n  necessitee faileth hem, they ne mighten nat ben wist biforn, and\r\n  that no-thing ne may ben comprehended by science but certein;\r\n  and yif tho thinges that ne han no certein bitydinges ben purveyed\r\n  as certein, it sholde ben dirknesse of opinioun, nat soothfastnesse    90\r\n  of science. And thou wenest that it be diverse fro the hoolnesse\r\n  of science that any man sholde deme a thing to ben other-weys\r\n  thanne it is it-self. And the cause of this erroure is, that of alle\r\n  the thinges that every wight hath y-knowe, they wenen that tho\r\n  thinges been y-knowe al-oonly by the strengthe and by the nature       95\r\n  of the thinges that ben y-wist or y-knowe; and it is al the\r\n  contrarie. For al that ever is y-knowe, it is rather comprehended\r\n  and knowen, nat after his strengthe and his nature, but after the\r\n  facultee, _that is to seyn, the power and the nature_, of hem that\r\n  knowen. And, for that this thing shal mowen shewen by a short         100\r\n  ensaumple: the same roundnesse of a body, other-weys the sighte\r\n  of the eye knoweth it, and other-weyes the touchinge. The\r\n  lokinge, by castinge of his bemes, waiteth and seeth from afer al\r\n  the body to-gidere, with-oute moevinge of it-self; but the touchinge\r\n  clyveth and conioineth to the rounde body, and moeveth aboute         105\r\n  the environinge, and comprehendeth by parties the roundnesse.\r\n  And the man him-self, other-weys wit biholdeth him, and\r\n  other-weys imaginacioun, and other-weys resoun, and other-weys\r\n  intelligence. For the wit comprehendeth withoute-forth the\r\n  figure of the body of the man that is establissed in the              110\r\n  matere subiect; but the imaginacioun comprehendeth only the\r\n  figure withoute the matere. Resoun surmounteth imaginacioun,\r\n  and comprehendeth by universal lokinge the comune spece that\r\n  is in the singuler peces. But the eye of intelligence is heyere; for\r\n  it surmounteth the environinge of the universitee, and looketh,       115\r\n  over that, by pure subtilitee of thoght, thilke same simple forme\r\n  _of man that is perdurably in the divyne thoght_. In whiche this\r\n  oughte greetly to ben considered, that the heyeste strengthe to\r\n  comprehenden thinges enbraseth and contieneth the lowere\r\n  strengthe; but the lowere strengthe ne aryseth nat in no manere       120\r\n  to heyere strengthe. For wit ne may no-thing comprehende out\r\n  of matere, ne the imaginacioun ne loketh nat the universels\r\n  speces, ne resoun taketh nat the simple forme _so as intelligence\r\n  taketh it_; but intelligence, that looketh al aboven, whan it hath\r\n  comprehended the forme, it knoweth and demeth alle the thinges        125\r\n  that ben under that forme. But _she knoweth hem_ in thilke manere\r\n  in the whiche it comprehendeth thilke same simple forme that\r\n  ne may never ben knowen to none of that other; _that is to seyn,\r\n  to none of tho three forseide thinges of the sowle_. For it knoweth\r\n  the universitee of resoun, and the figure of the imaginacioun,        130\r\n  and the sensible material _conceived by wit_; ne it ne useth nat nor\r\n  of resoun ne of imaginacioun ne of wit withoute-forth; but it\r\n  biholdeth alle thinges, so as I shal seye, by a strok of thought\r\n  formely, _withoute discours or collacioun_. Certes resoun, whan it\r\n  looketh any-thing universel, it ne useth nat of imaginacioun, nor     135\r\n  of witte, and algates yit it comprehendeth the thinges imaginable\r\n  and sensible; for resoun is she that diffinisseth the universel of hir\r\n  conseyte right thus:--man is a resonable two-foted beest. And\r\n  how so that this knowinge is universel, yet nis ther no wight that\r\n  ne woot wel that a man is a thing imaginable and sensible; and        140\r\n  this same considereth wel resoun; but that nis nat by imaginacioun\r\n  nor by wit, but it looketh it by a resonable concepcioun. Also\r\n  imaginacioun, al-be-it so that it taketh of wit the beginninges to\r\n  seen and to formen the figures, algates, al-thogh that wit ne were\r\n  nat present, yit it environeth and comprehendeth alle thinges         145\r\n  sensible; nat by resoun sensible of deminge, but by resoun\r\n  imaginatif. Seestow nat thanne that alle the thinges, in knowinge,\r\n  usen more of hir facultee or of hir power than _they doon of the\r\n  facultee or power_ of thinges that ben y-knowe? Ne that nis nat\r\n  wrong; for so as every Iugement is the dede or doinge of him          150\r\n  that demeth, it bihoveth that every wight performe the werk and\r\n  his entencioun, nat of foreine power, but of his propre power.\r\n\r\nPR.

The commune Iugement\r\n  of alle creatures resonables thanne is this: that god is eterne.\r\n  Lat us considere thanne what is eternitee; for certes that shal\r\n  shewen us to-gidere the devyne nature and the devyne science.\r\n\r\n  Eternitee, thanne, is parfit possessioun and al-togidere of lyf        10\r\n  interminable; and that sheweth more cleerly by the comparisoun\r\n  or the collacioun of temporel thinges. For al thing that liveth in\r\n  tyme it is present, and procedeth fro preterits in-to futures, _that is\r\n  to seyn, fro tyme passed in-to tyme cominge_; ne ther nis no-thing\r\n  establisshed in tyme that may enbracen to-gider al the space of        15\r\n  his lyf. For certes, yit ne hath it taken the tyme of to-morwe, and\r\n  it hath lost the tyme of yisterday. And certes, in the lyf of this\r\n  day, ye ne liven no more but right as in the moevable and\r\n  transitorie moment. Thanne thilke thing that suffreth temporel\r\n  condicioun, al-thogh that it never bigan to be, ne thogh it never      20\r\n  cese for to be, as Aristotle demed of the world, and al-thogh that\r\n  the lyf of it be strecched with infinitee of tyme, yit algates nis\r\n  it no swich thing that men mighten trowen by right that it is\r\n  eterne. For al-thogh that it comprehende and embrace the space\r\n  of lyf infinit, yit algates ne embraceth it nat the space of the lyf   25\r\n  al-togider; for it ne hath nat the futures that ne ben nat yit, _ne it\r\n  ne hath no lenger the preterits that ben y-doon or y-passed_. But\r\n  thilke thing thanne, that hath and comprehendeth to-gider al the\r\n  plentee of the lyf interminable, to whom ther ne faileth naught of\r\n  the future, and to whom ther nis naught of the preterit escaped        30\r\n  nor y-passed, thilke same is y-witnessed and y-proeved by right to\r\n  be eterne. And it bihoveth by necessitee that thilke thing be\r\n  al-wey present to him-self, and compotent; _as who seith, al-wey\r\n  present to him-self, and so mighty that al be right at his plesaunce_;\r\n  and that he have al present the infinitee of the moevable tyme.        35\r\n  Wher-for som men trowen wrongfully that, whan they heren that\r\n  it semede to Plato that this world ne hadde never beginninge\r\n  of tyme, ne that it never shal han failinge, they wenen in this\r\n  maner that this world be maked coeterne with his maker; _as who\r\n  seith, they wene that this world and god ben maked togider eterne,_    40\r\n  _and that is a wrongful weninge_. For other thing is it to ben y-lad\r\n  by lyf interminable, as Plato graunted to the world, and other\r\n  thing is it to embrace to-gider al the present of the lyf interminable,\r\n  the whiche thing it is cleer and manifest that it is propre to the\r\n  devyne thoght.                                                         45\r\n\r\n  Ne it ne sholde nat semen to us, that god is elder thanne\r\n  thinges that ben y-maked by quantitee of tyme, but rather by\r\n  the propretee of his simple nature. For this ilke infinit moevinge\r\n  of temporel thinges folweth this presentarie estat of lyf unmoevable;\r\n  and so as it ne may nat countrefeten it ne feynen it ne be evenlyke    50\r\n  to it for the inmoevabletee, _that is to seyn, that is in the\r\n  eternitee of god_, it faileth and falleth in-to moevinge fro the\r\n      simplicitee\r\n  of the presence _of god_, and disencreseth in-to the infinit\r\n  quantitee of future and of preterit: and so as it ne may nat han\r\n  to-gider al the plentee of the lyf, algates yit, for as moche as it    55\r\n  ne ceseth never for to ben in som maner, it semeth som-del to us,\r\n  that it folweth and resembleth thilke thing that it ne may nat\r\n  atayne to ne fulfillen, and bindeth it-self to som maner presence\r\n  of this litel and swifte moment: the which _presence of this litel\r\n  and swifte moment_, for that it bereth a maner image or lyknesse       60\r\n  of the ay-dwellinge presence _of god_, it graunteth, to swiche maner\r\n  thinges as it bitydeth to, that it semeth hem as thise thinges _han\r\n  y-ben, and_ ben.\r\n\r\n  And, for that _the presence of swich litel moment_ ne may nat\r\n  dwelle, ther-for it ravisshed and took the infinit wey of tyme, _that_ 65\r\n  _is to seyn, by successioun_; and by this maner is it y-doon, for that\r\n  it sholde continue the lyf in goinge, of the whiche lyf it ne mighte\r\n  nat enbrace the plentee in dwellinge. And for-thy, yif we wollen\r\n  putten worthy names to thinges, and folwen Plato, lat us seye\r\n  thanne soothly, that god is eterne, and the world is perpetuel.        70\r\n  Thanne, sin that every Iugement knoweth and comprehendeth by\r\n  his owne nature thinges that ben subiect un-to him, ther is soothly\r\n  to god, al-weys, an eterne and presentarie estat; and the science\r\n  of him, that over-passeth al temporel moevement, dwelleth in the\r\n  simplicitee of his presence, and embraceth and considereth alle        75\r\n  the infinit spaces of tymes, preterits and futures, and loketh, in\r\n  his simple knowinge, alle thinges _of preterit_ right as they weren\r\n  y-doon presently right now. Yif thou wolt thanne thenken and\r\n  avyse the prescience, by which it knoweth alle thinges, thou ne\r\n  shal nat demen it as prescience of thinges to comen, but thou          80\r\n  shalt demen it more rightfully that it is science of presence or of\r\n  instaunce, that never ne faileth. For which it nis nat y-cleped\r\n  \"previdence,\" but it sholde rather ben cleped \"purviaunce,\" that\r\n  is establisshed ful fer fro right lowe thinges, and biholdeth from\r\n  a-fer alle thinges, right as it were fro the heye heighte of thinges.  85\r\n\r\n  Why axestow thanne, or why desputestow thanne, that thilke\r\n  thinges ben doon by necessitee whiche that ben y-seyn and\r\n  knowen by the devyne sighte, sin that, forsothe, men ne maken\r\n  nat thilke thinges necessarie which that they seen ben y-doon in\r\n  hir sighte? For addeth thy biholdinge any necessitee to thilke         90\r\n  thinges that thou biholdest presente?'\r\n\r\n  'Nay,' quod I.\r\n\r\n  _Philosophie._ 'Certes, thanne, if men mighte maken any digne\r\n  comparisoun or collacioun of the presence devyne and of the\r\n  presence of mankinde, right so as ye seen some thinges in this         95\r\n  temporel present, right so seeth god alle thinges by his eterne\r\n  present. Wher-fore this devyne prescience ne chaungeth nat the\r\n  nature ne the propretee of thinges, but biholdeth swiche thinges\r\n  present to him-ward as they shullen bityde to yow-ward in tyme\r\n  to comen. Ne it confoundeth nat the Iugement of thinges; but          100\r\n  by o sighte of his thought, he knoweth the thinges to comen, as\r\n  wel necessarie as nat necessarie. Right so as whan ye seen\r\n  to-gider a man walken on the erthe and the sonne arysen in\r\n  the hevene, al-be-it so that ye seen and biholden that oon and\r\n  that other to-gider, yit natheles ye demen and discernen that that    105\r\n  oon is voluntarie and that other necessarie. Right so thanne the\r\n  devyne lookinge, biholdinge alle thinges under him, ne troubleth\r\n  nat the qualitee of thinges that ben certeinly present to him-ward;\r\n  but, as to the condicioun of tyme, forsothe, they ben future. For\r\n  which it folweth, that this nis noon opinioun, but rather a stedefast 110\r\n  knowinge, y-strengthed by soothnesse, that, whanne that god\r\n  knoweth anything to be, he ne unwot nat that thilke thing wanteth\r\n  necessitee to be; _this is to seyn, that, whan that god knoweth any\r\n  thing to bityde, he wot wel that it ne hath no necessitee to bityde._\r\n\r\n  And yif thou seyst heer, that thilke thing that god seeth to          115\r\n  bityde, it ne may nat unbityde (_as who seith, it mot bityde_), and\r\n  thilke thing that ne may nat unbityde it mot bityde by necessitee,\r\n  and that thou streyne me by this name of necessitee: certes,\r\n  I wol wel confessen and biknowe a thing of ful sad trouthe, but\r\n  unnethe shal ther any wight mowe _seen it or_ come ther-to, but-yif   120\r\n  that he be biholder of the devyne thoght. For I wol answeren\r\n  thee thus: that thilke thing that is future, whan it is referred\r\n  to the devyne knowinge, thanne is it necessarie; but certes, whan it\r\n  is understonden in his owne kinde, men seen it is outrely free,\r\n  and absolut _fro alle necessitee_.                                    125\r\n\r\n  For certes, ther ben two maneres of necessitee. That oon\r\n  necessitee is simple, as thus: that it bihoveth by necessitee, that\r\n  alle men be mortal _or deedly_. Another necessitee is conditionel,\r\n  as thus: yif thou wost that a man walketh, it bihoveth by necessitee\r\n  that he walke. Thilke thing thanne that any wight hath y-knowe        130\r\n  to be, it ne may ben non other weyes thanne he knoweth it to be.\r\n  But this condicioun ne draweth nat with hir thilke necessitee\r\n  simple. For certes, this necessitee _conditionel_, the propre nature\r\n  of it ne maketh it nat, but the adieccioun of the condicioun\r\n  _maketh it_. For no necessitee ne constreyneth a man to gon,          135\r\n  that goth by his propre wil; al-be-it so that, whan he goth,\r\n  that it is necessarie that he goth. Right on this same maner\r\n  thanne, yif that the purviaunce of god seeth any thing present,\r\n  than mot thilke thing ben by necessitee, al-thogh that it ne have\r\n  no necessitee of his owne nature. But certes, the futures that        140\r\n  bityden by freedom of arbitre, god seeth hem alle to-gider present.\r\n  Thise thinges thanne, yif they ben referred to the devyne sighte,\r\n  thanne ben they maked necessarie by the condicioun of the\r\n  devyne knowinge. But certes, yif thilke thinges be considered\r\n  by hem-self, they ben absolut _of necessitee_, and ne forleten nat ne 145\r\n  cesen nat of the libertee of hir owne nature. Thanne, certes,\r\n  with-oute doute, alle the thinges shollen ben doon which that\r\n  god wot biforn that they ben to comen. But som of hem comen\r\n  and bityden of free arbitre _or of free wille_, that, al-be-it so that\r\n  they bityden, yit algates ne lese they nat hir propre nature in       150\r\n  beinge; by the which first, or that they weren y-doon, they\r\n  hadden power nat to han bitid.'\r\n\r\n  _Boece_. 'What is this to seyn thanne,' quod I, 'that thinges ne\r\n  ben nat necessarie _by hir propre nature_, so as they comen in alle\r\n  maneres in the lyknesse of necessitee by the condicioun of the        155\r\n  devyne science?'\r\n\r\n  _Philosophie._ 'This is the difference,' quod she; 'that tho\r\n  thinges that I purposede thee a litel heer-biforn, that is to seyn,\r\n  the sonne arysinge and the man walkinge, that, ther-whyles that\r\n  thilke thinges been y-doon, they ne mighte nat ben undoon;            160\r\n  natheles, that oon of hem, or it was y-doon, it bihoved by necessitee\r\n  that it was y-doon, but nat that other. Right so _is it\r\n  here_, that the thinges that god hath present, with-oute doute they\r\n  shollen been. But som of hem descendeth of the nature of\r\n  thinges, _as the sonne arysinge_; and som descendeth of the power     165\r\n  of the doeres, _as the man walkinge_. Thanne seide I no wrong,\r\n  that yif these thinges ben referred to the devyne knowinge, thanne\r\n  ben they necessarie; and yif they ben considered by hem-self,\r\n  thanne ben they absolut fro the bond of necessitee. Right so as\r\n  alle thinges that apereth or sheweth to the wittes, yif thou referre  170\r\n  it to resoun, it is universel; and yif thou referre it or loke it\r\n  to it-self, than is it singuler. But now, yif thou seyst thus, that\r\n  yif it be in my power to chaunge my purpos, than shal I voide the\r\n  purviaunce _of god_, whan that, peraventure, I shal han chaunged\r\n  the thinges that he knoweth biforn, thanne shal I answere thee        175\r\n  thus. Certes, thou mayst wel chaunge thy purpos; but, for as\r\n  mochel as the present soothnesse of the devyne purviaunce biholdeth\r\n  that thou mayst chaunge thy purpos, and whether thou\r\n  wolt chaunge it or no, and whiderward that thou torne it, thou ne\r\n  mayst nat eschuen the devyne prescience; right as thou ne mayst       180\r\n  nat fleen the sighte of the presente eye, al-though that thou torne\r\n  thy-self by thy free wil in-to dyverse acciouns. But thou mayst\r\n  seyn ayein: \"How shal it thanne be? Shal nat the devyne\r\n  science be chaunged by my disposicioun, whan that I wol o thing\r\n  now, and now another? And thilke prescience, ne semeth it nat         185\r\n  to entrechaunge stoundes of knowinge;\"' _as who seith, ne shal it\r\n  nat seme to us, that the devyne prescience entrechaungeth hise dyverse\r\n  stoundes of knowinge, so that it knowe sum-tyme o thing and sum-tyme\r\n  the contrarie of that thing?_\r\n\r\n  'No, forsothe,' _quod I_.                                             190\r\n\r\n  _Philosophie._ 'For the devyne sighte renneth to-forn and seeth alle\r\n  futures, and clepeth hem ayein, and retorneth hem to the presence\r\n  of his propre knowinge; ne he ne entrechaungeth nat, so as thou\r\n  wenest, the stoundes of forknowinge, as now this, now that; but\r\n  he ay-dwellinge comth biforn, and embraceth at o strook alle thy      195\r\n  mutaciouns. And this presence to comprehenden and to seen\r\n  alle thinges, god ne hath nat taken it of the bitydinge of thinges\r\n  to come, but of his propre simplicitee. And her-by is assoiled\r\n  thilke thing that thou puttest a litel her-biforn, _that is to seyn_,\r\n  that it is unworthy thing to seyn, that our futures yeven cause of    200\r\n  the science of god. For certes, this strengthe of the devyne\r\n  science, which that embraceth alle thinges by his presentarie\r\n  knowinge, establissheth maner to alle thinges, and it ne oweth\r\n  naught to latter thinges; and sin that these thinges ben thus,\r\n  _that is to seyn, sin that necessitee nis nat in thinges by the\r\n      devyne_                                                           205\r\n  _prescience_, than is ther freedom of arbitre, that dwelleth hool and\r\n  unwemmed to mortal men. Ne the lawes ne purposen nat\r\n  wikkedly medes and peynes to the willinges of men that ben\r\n  unbounden and quite of alle necessitee. And god, biholder and\r\n  for-witer of alle thinges, dwelleth above; and the present eternitee  210\r\n  of his sighte renneth alwey with the dyverse qualitee of oure\r\n  dedes, despensinge and ordeyninge medes to goode men, and\r\n  torments to wikked men.

The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,\r\n  That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,\r\n  In lovinge, how his aventures fellen\r\n  Fro wo to wele, and after out of Ioye,\r\n  My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye.                                   5\r\n  Thesiphone, thou help me for tendyte\r\n  Thise woful vers, that wepen as I wryte!\r\n\r\n  2. To thee clepe I, thou goddesse of torment,\r\n  Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peyne;\r\n  Help me, that am the sorwful instrument                                10\r\n  That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleyne!\r\n  For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne,\r\n  A woful wight to han a drery fere,\r\n  And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.\r\n\r\n  3. For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve,                           15\r\n  Ne dar to Love, for myn unlyklinesse,\r\n  Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfor sterve,\r\n  So fer am I fro his help in derknesse;\r\n  But nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse\r\n  To any lover, and his cause avayle,                                    20\r\n  Have he my thank, and myn be this travayle!\r\n\r\n  4. But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse,\r\n  If any drope of pitee in yow be,\r\n  Remembreth yow on passed hevinesse\r\n  That ye han felt, and on the adversitee                                25\r\n  Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye\r\n  Han felt that Love dorste yow displese;\r\n  Or ye han wonne him with to greet an ese.\r\n\r\n  5. And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas\r\n  Of Troilus, as ye may after here,                                      30\r\n  That love hem bringe in hevene to solas,\r\n  And eek for me preyeth to god so dere,\r\n  That I have might to shewe, in som manere,\r\n  Swich peyne and wo as Loves folk endure,\r\n  In Troilus unsely aventure.                                            35\r\n\r\n  6. And biddeth eek for hem that been despeyred\r\n  In love, that never nil recovered be,\r\n  And eek for hem that falsly been apeyred\r\n  Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;\r\n  Thus biddeth god, for his benignitee,                                  40\r\n  To graunte hem sone out of this world to pace,\r\n  That been despeyred out of Loves grace.\r\n\r\n  7. And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese,\r\n  That god hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,\r\n  And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese,                            45\r\n  That it to Love be worship and plesaunce.\r\n  For so hope I my soule best avaunce,\r\n  To preye for hem that Loves servaunts be,\r\n  And wryte hir wo, and live in charitee.\r\n\r\n  8. And for to have of hem compassioun                                  50\r\n  As though I were hir owene brother dere.\r\n  Now herkeneth with a gode entencioun,\r\n  For now wol I gon streight to my matere,\r\n  In whiche ye may the double sorwes here\r\n  Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde,                                     55\r\n  And how that she forsook him er she deyde.\r\n\r\n  9. It is wel wist, how that the Grekes stronge\r\n  In armes with a thousand shippes wente\r\n  To Troyewardes, and the citee longe\r\n  Assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente,                               60\r\n  And, in diverse wyse and oon entente,\r\n  The ravisshing to wreken of Eleyne,\r\n  By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peyne.\r\n\r\n  10. Now fil it so, that in the toun ther was\r\n  Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee,                                  65\r\n  A gret devyn that cleped was Calkas,\r\n  That in science so expert was, that he\r\n  Knew wel that Troye sholde destroyed be,\r\n  By answere of his god, that highte thus,\r\n  Daun Phebus or Apollo Delphicus.                                       70\r\n\r\n  11. So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge,\r\n  And eek by answere of this Appollo,\r\n  That Grekes sholden swich a peple bringe,\r\n  Thorugh which that Troye moste been for-do,\r\n  He caste anoon out of the toun to go;                                  75\r\n  For wel wiste he, by sort, that Troye sholde\r\n  Destroyed been, ye, wolde who-so nolde.\r\n\r\n  12. For which, for to departen softely\r\n  Took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse,\r\n  And to the Grekes ost ful prively                                      80\r\n  He stal anoon; and they, in curteys wyse,\r\n  Him deden bothe worship and servyse,\r\n  In trust that he hath conning hem to rede\r\n  In every peril which that is to drede.\r\n\r\n  13. The noyse up roos, whan it was first aspyed,                       85\r\n  Thorugh al the toun, and generally was spoken,\r\n  That Calkas traytor fled was, and allyed\r\n  With hem of Grece; and casten to ben wroken\r\n  On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken;\r\n  And seyden, he and al his kin at ones                                  90\r\n  Ben worthy for to brennen, fel and bones.\r\n\r\n  14. Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce,\r\n  Al unwist of this false and wikked dede,\r\n  His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce,\r\n  For of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede,                              95\r\n  As she that niste what was best to rede;\r\n  For bothe a widowe was she, and allone\r\n  Of any freend, to whom she dorste hir mone.\r\n\r\n  15. Criseyde was this lady name a-right;\r\n  As to my dome, in al Troyes citee                                     100\r\n  Nas noon so fair, for passing every wight\r\n  So aungellyk was hir natyf beautee,\r\n  That lyk a thing inmortal semed she,\r\n  As doth an hevenish parfit creature,\r\n  That doun were sent in scorning of nature.                            105\r\n\r\n  16. This lady, which that al-day herde at ere\r\n  Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun,\r\n  Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,\r\n  In widewes habit large of samit broun,\r\n  On knees she fil biforn Ector a-doun;                                 110\r\n  With pitous voys, and tendrely wepinge,\r\n  His mercy bad, hir-selven excusinge.\r\n\r\n  17. Now was this Ector pitous of nature,\r\n  And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon,\r\n  And that she was so fair a creature;                                  115\r\n  Of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon,\r\n  And seyde, 'lat your fadres treson goon\r\n  Forth with mischaunce, and ye your-self, in Ioye,\r\n  Dwelleth with us, whyl you good list, in Troye.\r\n\r\n  18. And al thonour that men may doon yow have,                        120\r\n  As ferforth as your fader dwelled here,\r\n  Ye shul han, and your body shal men save,\r\n  As fer as I may ought enquere or here.'\r\n  And she him thonked with ful humble chere,\r\n  And ofter wolde, and it hadde ben his wille,                          125\r\n  And took hir leve, and hoom, and held hir stille.\r\n\r\n  19. And in hir hous she abood with swich meynee\r\n  As to hir honour nede was to holde;\r\n  And whyl she was dwellinge in that citee,\r\n  Kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde                          130\r\n  Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde.\r\n  But whether that she children hadde or noon,\r\n  I rede it nought; therfore I lete it goon.\r\n\r\n  20. The thinges fellen, as they doon of werre,\r\n  Bitwixen hem of Troye and Grekes ofte;                                135\r\n  For som day boughten they of Troye it derre,\r\n  And eft the Grekes founden no thing softe\r\n  The folk of Troye; and thus fortune on-lofte,\r\n  And under eft, gan hem to wheelen bothe\r\n  After hir cours, ay whyl they were wrothe.                            140\r\n\r\n  21. But how this toun com to destruccioun\r\n  Ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle;\r\n  For it were here a long disgressioun\r\n  Fro my matere, and yow to longe dwelle.\r\n  But the Troyane gestes, as they felle,                                145\r\n  In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dyte,\r\n  Who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte.\r\n\r\n  22. But though that Grekes hem of Troye shetten,\r\n  And hir citee bisegede al a-boute,\r\n  Hir olde usage wolde they not letten,                                 150\r\n  As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute;\r\n  But aldermost in honour, out of doute,\r\n  They hadde a relik hight Palladion,\r\n  That was hir trist a-boven everichon.\r\n\r\n  23. And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme                             155\r\n  Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede\r\n  With newe grene, of lusty Ver the pryme,\r\n  And swote smellen floures whyte and rede,\r\n  In sondry wyses shewed, as I rede,\r\n  The folk of Troye hir observaunces olde,                              160\r\n  Palladiones feste for to holde.\r\n\r\n  24. And to the temple, in al hir beste wyse,\r\n  In general, ther wente many a wight,\r\n  To herknen of Palladion the servyse;\r\n  And namely, so many a lusty knight,                                   165\r\n  So many a lady fresh and mayden bright,\r\n  Ful wel arayed, bothe moste and leste,\r\n  Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste.\r\n\r\n  25. Among thise othere folk was Criseyda,\r\n  In widewes habite blak; but nathelees,                                170\r\n  Right as our firste lettre is now an A,\r\n  In beautee first so stood she, makelees;\r\n  Hir godly looking gladede al the prees.\r\n  Nas never seyn thing to ben preysed derre,\r\n  Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre                              175\r\n\r\n  26. As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichoon\r\n  That hir bihelden in hir blake wede;\r\n  And yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon,\r\n  Bihinden othere folk, in litel brede,\r\n  And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede,                            180\r\n  Simple of a-tyr, and debonaire of chere,\r\n  With ful assured loking and manere.\r\n\r\n  27. This Troilus, as he was wont to gyde\r\n  His yonge knightes, ladde hem up and doun\r\n  In thilke large temple on every syde,                                 185\r\n  Biholding ay the ladyes of the toun,\r\n  Now here, now there, for no devocioun\r\n  Hadde he to noon, to reven him his reste,\r\n  But gan to preyse and lakken whom him leste.\r\n\r\n  28. And in his walk ful fast he gan to wayten                         190\r\n  If knight or squyer of his companye\r\n  Gan for to syke, or lete his eyen bayten\r\n  On any woman that he coude aspye;\r\n  He wolde smyle, and holden it folye,\r\n  And seye him thus, 'god wot, she slepeth softe                        195\r\n  For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte!\r\n\r\n  29. 'I have herd told, pardieux, of your livinge,\r\n  Ye lovers, and your lewede observaunces,\r\n  And which a labour folk han in winninge\r\n  Of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces;                        200\r\n  And whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces;\r\n  O verrey foles! nyce and blinde be ye;\r\n  Ther nis not oon can war by other be.'\r\n\r\n  30. And with that word he gan cast up the browe,\r\n  Ascaunces, 'lo! is this nought wysly spoken?'                         205\r\n  At which the god of love gan loken rowe\r\n  Right for despyt, and shoop for to ben wroken;\r\n  He kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken;\r\n  For sodeynly he hit him at the fulle;\r\n  And yet as proud a pekok can he pulle.                                210\r\n\r\n  31. O blinde world, O blinde entencioun!\r\n  How ofte falleth al theffect contraire\r\n  Of surquidrye and foul presumpcioun;\r\n  For caught is proud, and caught is debonaire.\r\n  This Troilus is clomben on the staire,                                215\r\n  And litel weneth that he moot descenden.\r\n  But al-day falleth thing that foles ne wenden.\r\n\r\n  32. As proude Bayard ginneth for to skippe\r\n  Out of the wey, so priketh him his corn,\r\n  Til he a lash have of the longe whippe,                               220\r\n  Than thenketh he, 'though I praunce al biforn\r\n  First in the trays, ful fat and newe shorn,\r\n  Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe\r\n  I moot endure, and with my feres drawe.'\r\n\r\n  33. So ferde it by this fers and proude knight;                       225\r\n  Though he a worthy kinges sone were,\r\n  And wende no-thing hadde had swiche might\r\n  Ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere,\r\n  Yet with a look his herte wex a-fere,\r\n  That he, that now was most in pryde above,                            230\r\n  Wex sodeynly most subget un-to love.\r\n\r\n  34. For-thy ensample taketh of this man,\r\n  Ye wyse, proude, and worthy folkes alle,\r\n  To scornen Love, which that so sone can\r\n  The freedom of your hertes to him thralle;                            235\r\n  For ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle,\r\n  That Love is he that alle thing may binde;\r\n  For may no man for-do the lawe of kinde.\r\n\r\n  35. That this be sooth, hath preved and doth yet;\r\n  For this trowe I ye knowen, alle or some,                             240\r\n  Men reden not that folk han gretter wit\r\n  Than they that han be most with love y-nome;\r\n  And strengest folk ben therwith overcome,\r\n  The worthiest and grettest of degree;\r\n  This was, and is, and yet men shal it see.                            245\r\n\r\n  36. And trewelich it sit wel to be so;\r\n  For alderwysest han ther-with ben plesed;\r\n  And they that han ben aldermost in wo,\r\n  With love han ben conforted most and esed;\r\n  And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed,                              250\r\n  And worthy folk maad worthier of name,\r\n  And causeth most to dreden vyce and shame.\r\n\r\n  37. Now sith it may not goodly be withstonde,\r\n  And is a thing so vertuous in kinde,\r\n  Refuseth not to Love for to be bonde,                                 255\r\n  Sin, as him-selven list, he may yow binde.\r\n  The yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde\r\n  Than that that brest; and therfor I yow rede\r\n  To folwen him that so wel can yow lede.\r\n\r\n  38. But for to tellen forth in special                                260\r\n  As of this kinges sone of which I tolde,\r\n  And leten other thing collateral,\r\n  Of him thenke I my tale for to holde,\r\n  Bothe of his Ioye, and of his cares colde;\r\n  And al his werk, as touching this matere,                             265\r\n  For I it gan, I wil ther-to refere.\r\n\r\n  39. With-inne the temple he wente him forth pleyinge,\r\n  This Troilus, of every wight aboute,\r\n  On this lady and now on that lokinge,\r\n  Wher-so she were of toune, or of with-oute:                           270\r\n  And up-on cas bifel, that thorugh a route\r\n  His eye perced, and so depe it wente,\r\n  Til on Criseyde it smoot, and ther it stente.\r\n\r\n  40. And sodeynly he wex ther-with astoned,\r\n  And gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wyse:                             275\r\n  'O mercy, god!' thoughte he, 'wher hastow woned,\r\n  That art so fair and goodly to devyse?'\r\n  Ther-with his herte gan to sprede and ryse,\r\n  And softe sighed, lest men mighte him here,\r\n  And caughte a-yein his firste pleyinge chere.                         280\r\n\r\n  41. She nas not with the leste of hir stature,\r\n  But alle hir limes so wel answeringe\r\n  Weren to womanhode, that creature\r\n  Was neuer lasse mannish in seminge.\r\n  And eek the pure wyse of here meninge                                 285\r\n  Shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse\r\n  Honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse.\r\n\r\n  42. To Troilus right wonder wel with-alle\r\n  Gan for to lyke hir mening and hir chere,\r\n  Which somdel deynous was, for she leet falle                          290\r\n  Hir look a lite a-side, in swich manere,\r\n  Ascaunces, 'what! may I not stonden here?'\r\n  And after that hir loking gan she lighte,\r\n  That never thoughte him seen so good a sighte.\r\n\r\n  43. And of hir look in him ther gan to quiken                         295\r\n  So greet desir, and swich affeccioun,\r\n  That in his hertes botme gan to stiken\r\n  Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun:\r\n  And though he erst hadde poured up and doun,\r\n  He was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke;                             300\r\n  Unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke.\r\n\r\n  44. Lo, he that leet him-selven so konninge,\r\n  And scorned hem that loves peynes dryen,\r\n  Was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge\r\n  With-inne the subtile stremes of hir yën;                             305\r\n  That sodeynly him thoughte he felte dyen,\r\n  Right with hir look, the spirit in his herte;\r\n  Blessed be love, that thus can folk converte!\r\n\r\n  45. She, this in blak, lykinge to Troylus,\r\n  Over alle thyng he stood for to biholde;                              310\r\n  Ne his desir, ne wherfor he stood thus,\r\n  He neither chere made, ne worde tolde;\r\n  But from a-fer, his maner for to holde,\r\n  On other thing his look som-tyme he caste,\r\n  And eft on hir, whyl that servyse laste.                              315\r\n\r\n  46. And after this, not fulliche al awhaped,\r\n  Out of the temple al esiliche he wente,\r\n  Repentinge him that he hadde ever y-iaped\r\n  Of loves folk, lest fully the descente\r\n  Of scorn fille on him-self; but, what he mente,                       320\r\n  Lest it were wist on any maner syde,\r\n  His wo he gan dissimulen and hyde.\r\n\r\n  47. Whan he was fro the temple thus departed,\r\n  He streyght anoon un-to his paleys torneth,\r\n  Right with hir look thurgh-shoten and thurgh-darted,                  325\r\n  Al feyneth he in lust that he soiorneth;\r\n  And al his chere and speche also he borneth;\r\n  And ay, of loves servants every whyle,\r\n  Him-self to wrye, at hem he gan to smyle.\r\n\r\n  48. And seyde, 'lord, so ye live al in lest,                          330\r\n  Ye loveres! for the conningest of yow,\r\n  That serveth most ententiflich and best,\r\n  Him tit as often harm ther-of as prow;\r\n  Your hyre is quit ayein, ye, god wot how!\r\n  Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servyse;                       335\r\n  In feith, your ordre is ruled in good wyse!\r\n\r\n  49. In noun-certeyn ben alle your observaunces,\r\n  But it a sely fewe poyntes be;\r\n  Ne no-thing asketh so grete attendaunces\r\n  As doth your lay, and that knowe alle ye;                             340\r\n  But that is not the worste, as mote I thee;\r\n  But, tolde I yow the worste poynt, I leve,\r\n  Al seyde I sooth, ye wolden at me greve!\r\n\r\n  50. But tak this, that ye loveres ofte eschuwe,\r\n  Or elles doon of good entencioun,                                     345\r\n  Ful ofte thy lady wole it misconstrue,\r\n  And deme it harm in hir opinioun;\r\n  And yet if she, for other enchesoun,\r\n  Be wrooth, than shalt thou han a groyn anoon:\r\n  Lord! wel is him that may be of yow oon!'                             350\r\n\r\n  51. But for al this, whan that he say his tyme,\r\n  He held his pees, non other bote him gayned;\r\n  For love bigan his fetheres so to lyme,\r\n  That wel unnethe un-to his folk he feyned\r\n  That othere besye nedes him destrayned;                               355\r\n  For wo was him, that what to doon he niste,\r\n  But bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste.\r\n\r\n  52. And whan that he in chaumbre was allone,\r\n  He doun up-on his beddes feet him sette,\r\n  And first he gan to syke, and eft to grone,                           360\r\n  And thoughte ay on hir so, with-outen lette,\r\n  That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette\r\n  That he hir saw a temple, and al the wyse\r\n  Right of hir loke, and gan it newe avyse.\r\n\r\n  53. Thus gan he make a mirour of his minde,                           365\r\n  In which he saugh al hoolly hir figure;\r\n  And that he wel coude in his herte finde,\r\n  It was to him a right good aventure\r\n  To love swich oon, and if he dide his cure\r\n  To serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace,                          370\r\n  Or elles, for oon of hir servaunts pace.\r\n\r\n  54. Imagininge that travaille nor grame\r\n  Ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn\r\n  As she, ne him for his desir ne shame,\r\n  Al were it wist, but in prys and up-born                              375\r\n  Of alle lovers wel more than biforn;\r\n  Thus argumented he in his ginninge,\r\n  Ful unavysed of his wo cominge.\r\n\r\n  55. Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe,\r\n  And thoughte he wolde werken prively,                                 380\r\n  First, to hyden his desir in muwe\r\n  From every wight y-born, al-outrely,\r\n  But he mighte ought recovered be therby;\r\n  Remembring him, that love to wyde y-blowe\r\n  Yelt bittre fruyt, though swete seed be sowe.                         385\r\n\r\n  56. And over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte\r\n  What for to speke, and what to holden inne,\r\n  And what to arten hir to love he soughte,\r\n  And on a song anoon-right to biginne,\r\n  And gan loude on his sorwe for to winne;                              390\r\n  For with good hope he gan fully assente\r\n  Criseyde for to love, and nought repente.\r\n\r\n  57. And of his song nought only the sentence,\r\n  As writ myn autour called Lollius,\r\n  But pleynly, save our tonges difference,                              395\r\n  I dar wel sayn, in al that Troilus\r\n  Seyde in his song; lo! every word right thus\r\n  As I shal seyn; and who-so list it here,\r\n  Lo! next this vers, he may it finden here.\r\n\r\n                      CANTUS TROILI.\r\n\r\n  58. 'If no love is, O god, what fele I so?                            400\r\n  And if love is, what thing and whiche is he!\r\n  If love be good, from whennes comth my wo?\r\n  If it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me,\r\n  Whenne every torment and adversitee\r\n  That cometh of him, may to me savory thinke;                          405\r\n  For ay thurst I, the more that I it drinke.\r\n\r\n  59. And if that at myn owene lust I brenne,\r\n  Fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleynte?\r\n  If harme agree me, wher-to pleyne I thenne?\r\n  I noot, ne why unwery that I feynte.                                  410\r\n  O quike deeth, o swete harm so queynte,\r\n  How may of thee in me swich quantitee,\r\n  But-if that I consente that it be?\r\n\r\n  60. And if that I consente, I wrongfully\r\n  Compleyne, y-wis; thus possed to and fro,                             415\r\n  Al sterelees with-inne a boot am I\r\n  A-mid the see, by-twixen windes two,\r\n  That in contrarie stonden ever-mo.\r\n  Allas! what is this wonder maladye?\r\n  For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I deye.'                          420\r\n\r\n  61. And to the god of love thus seyde he\r\n  With pitous voys, 'O lord, now youres is\r\n  My spirit, which that oughte youres be.\r\n  Yow thanke I, lord, that han me brought to this;\r\n  But whether goddesse or womman, y-wis,                                425\r\n  She be, I noot, which that ye do me serve;\r\n  But as hir man I wole ay live and sterve.\r\n\r\n  62. Ye stonden in hire eyen mightily,\r\n  As in a place un-to your vertu digne;\r\n  Wherfore, lord, if my servyse or I                                    430\r\n  May lyke yow, so beth to me benigne;\r\n  For myn estat royal here I resigne\r\n  In-to hir hond, and with ful humble chere\r\n  Bicome hir man, as to my lady dere.'\r\n\r\n  63. In him ne deyned sparen blood royal                               435\r\n  The fyr of love, wher-fro god me blesse,\r\n  Ne him forbar in no degree, for al\r\n  His vertu or his excellent prowesse;\r\n  But held him as his thral lowe in distresse,\r\n  And brende him so in sondry wyse ay newe,                             440\r\n  That sixty tyme a day he loste his hewe.\r\n\r\n  64. So muche, day by day, his owene thought,\r\n  For lust to hir, gan quiken and encrese,\r\n  That every other charge he sette at nought;\r\n  For-thy ful ofte, his hote fyr to cese,                               445\r\n  To seen hir goodly look he gan to prese;\r\n  For ther-by to ben esed wel he wende,\r\n  And ay the ner he was, the more he brende.\r\n\r\n  65. For ay the ner the fyr, the hotter is,\r\n  This, trowe I, knoweth al this companye.                              450\r\n  But were he fer or neer, I dar seye this,\r\n  By night or day, for wysdom or folye,\r\n  His herte, which that is his brestes yë,\r\n  Was ay on hir, that fairer was to sene\r\n  Than ever was Eleyne or Polixene.                                     455\r\n\r\n  66. Eek of the day ther passed nought an houre\r\n  That to him-self a thousand tyme he seyde,\r\n  'Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure,\r\n  As I best can, now wolde god, Criseyde,\r\n  Ye wolden on me rewe er that I deyde!                                 460\r\n  My dere herte, allas! myn hele and hewe\r\n  And lyf is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.'\r\n\r\n  67. Alle othere dredes weren from him fledde,\r\n  Bothe of the assege and his savacioun;\r\n  Ne in him desyr noon othere fownes bredde                             465\r\n  But arguments to this conclusioun,\r\n  That she on him wolde han compassioun,\r\n  And he to be hir man, whyl he may dure;\r\n  Lo, here his lyf, and from the deeth his cure!\r\n\r\n  68. The sharpe shoures felle of armes preve,                          470\r\n  That Ector or his othere bretheren diden,\r\n  Ne made him only ther-fore ones meve;\r\n  And yet was he, wher-so men wente or riden,\r\n  Founde oon the best, and lengest tyme abiden\r\n  Ther peril was, and dide eek such travayle                            475\r\n  In armes, that to thenke it was mervayle.\r\n\r\n  69. But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde,\r\n  Ne also for the rescous of the toun,\r\n  Ne made him thus in armes for to madde,\r\n  But only, lo, for this conclusioun,                                   480\r\n  To lyken hir the bet for his renoun;\r\n  Fro day to day in armes so he spedde,\r\n  That alle the Grekes as the deeth him dredde.\r\n\r\n  70. And fro this forth tho refte him love his sleep,\r\n  And made his mete his foo; and eek his sorwe                          485\r\n  Gan multiplye, that, who-so toke keep,\r\n  It shewed in his hewe, bothe eve and morwe;\r\n  Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe\r\n  Of other syknesse, lest of him men wende\r\n  That the hote fyr of love him brende.                                 490\r\n\r\n  71. And seyde, he hadde a fever and ferde amis;\r\n  But how it was, certayn, can I not seye,\r\n  If that his lady understood not this,\r\n  Or feyned hir she niste, oon of the tweye;\r\n  But wel I rede that, by no maner weye,                                495\r\n  Ne semed it [as] that she of him roughte,\r\n  Nor of his peyne, or what-so-ever he thoughte.\r\n\r\n  72. But than fel to this Troylus such wo,\r\n  That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede\r\n  Was this, that she som wight had loved so,                            500\r\n  That never of him she wolde have taken hede;\r\n  For whiche him thoughte he felte his herte blede.\r\n  Ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne\r\n  To tellen it, for al this world to winne.\r\n\r\n  73. But whanne he hadde a space fro his care,                         505\r\n  Thus to him-self ful ofte he gan to pleyne;\r\n  He sayde, 'O fool, now art thou in the snare,\r\n  That whilom Iapedest at loves peyne;\r\n  Now artow hent, now gnaw thyn owene cheyne;\r\n  Thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende                              510\r\n  Of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende.\r\n\r\n  74. What wole now every lover seyn of thee,\r\n  If this be wist, but ever in thyn absence\r\n  Laughen in scorn, and seyn, \"lo, ther gooth he,\r\n  That is the man of so gret sapience,                                  515\r\n  That held us loveres leest in reverence!\r\n  Now, thonked be god, he may goon in the daunce\r\n  Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce!\r\n\r\n  75. But, O thou woful Troilus, god wolde,\r\n  Sin thow most loven thurgh thy destinee,                              520\r\n  That thow beset were on swich oon that sholde\r\n  Knowe al thy wo, al lakkede hir pitee:\r\n  But al so cold in love, towardes thee,\r\n  Thy lady is, as frost in winter mone,\r\n  And thou fordoon, as snow in fyr is sone.\"                            525\r\n\r\n  76. God wolde I were aryved in the port\r\n  Of deeth, to which my sorwe wil me lede!\r\n  A, lord, to me it were a greet comfort;\r\n  Then were I quit of languisshing in drede.\r\n  For by myn hidde sorwe y-blowe on brede                               530\r\n  I shal bi-Iaped been a thousand tyme\r\n  More than that fool of whos folye men ryme.\r\n\r\n  77. But now help god, and ye, swete, for whom\r\n  I pleyne, y-caught, ye, never wight so faste!\r\n  O mercy, dere herte, and help me from                                 535\r\n  The deeth, for I, whyl that my lyf may laste,\r\n  More than my-self wol love yow to my laste.\r\n  And with som freendly look gladeth me, swete,\r\n  Though never more thing ye me bi-hete!'\r\n\r\n  78. This wordes and ful manye an-other to                             540\r\n  He spak, and called ever in his compleynte\r\n  Hir name, for to tellen hir his wo,\r\n  Til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte.\r\n  Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleynte;\r\n  And whan that he bithoughte on that folye,                            545\r\n  A thousand fold his wo gan multiplye.\r\n\r\n  79. Bi-wayling in his chambre thus allone,\r\n  A freend of his, that called was Pandare,\r\n  Com ones in unwar, and herde him grone,\r\n  And sey his freend in swich distresse and care:                       550\r\n  'Allas!' quod he, 'who causeth al this fare?\r\n  O mercy, god! what unhap may this mene?\r\n  Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene?\r\n\r\n  80. Or hastow som remors of conscience,\r\n  And art now falle in som devocioun,                                   555\r\n  And waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence,\r\n  And hast for ferde caught attricioun?\r\n  God save hem that bi-seged han our toun,\r\n  And so can leye our Iolyte on presse,\r\n  And bring our lusty folk to holinesse!'                               560\r\n\r\n  81. These wordes seyde he for the nones alle,\r\n  That with swich thing he mighte him angry maken,\r\n  And with an angre don his sorwe falle,\r\n  As for the tyme, and his corage awaken;\r\n  But wel he wiste, as fer as tonges spaken,                            565\r\n  Ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse\r\n  Than he, ne more desired worthinesse.\r\n\r\n  82. 'What cas,' quod Troilus, 'or what aventure\r\n  Hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge,\r\n  That am refus of euery creature?                                      570\r\n  But for the love of god, at my preyinge,\r\n  Go henne a-way, for certes, my deyinge\r\n  Wol thee disese, and I mot nedes deye;\r\n  Ther-for go wey, ther is no more to seye.\r\n\r\n  83. But if thou wene I be thus syk for drede,                         575\r\n  It is not so, and ther-for scorne nought;\r\n  Ther is a-nother thing I take of hede\r\n  Wel more than ought the Grekes han y-wrought,\r\n  Which cause is of my deeth, for sorwe and thought.\r\n  But though that I now telle thee it ne leste,                         580\r\n  Be thou nought wrooth, I hyde it for the beste.'\r\n\r\n  84. This Pandare, that neigh malt for wo and routhe,\r\n  Ful often seyde, 'allas! what may this be?\r\n  Now freend,' quod he, 'if ever love or trouthe\r\n  Hath been, or is, bi-twixen thee and me,                              585\r\n  Ne do thou never swiche a crueltee\r\n  To hyde fro thy freend so greet a care;\r\n  Wostow nought wel that it am I, Pandare?\r\n\r\n  85. I wole parten with thee al thy peyne,\r\n  If it be so I do thee no comfort,                                     590\r\n  As it is freendes right, sooth for to seyne,\r\n  To entreparten wo, as glad desport.\r\n  I have, and shal, for trewe or fals report,\r\n  In wrong and right y-loved thee al my lyve;\r\n  Hyd not thy wo fro me, but telle it blyve.'                           595\r\n\r\n  86. Than gan this sorwful Troilus to syke,\r\n  And seyde him thus, 'god leve it be my beste\r\n  To telle it thee; for, sith it may thee lyke,\r\n  Yet wole I telle it, though myn herte breste;\r\n  And wel wot I thou mayst do me no reste.                              600\r\n  But lest thow deme I truste not to thee,\r\n  Now herkne, freend, for thus it stant with me.\r\n\r\n  87. Love, a-yeins the which who-so defendeth\r\n  Him-selven most, him alder-lest avayleth,\r\n  With desespeir so sorwfully me offendeth,                             605\r\n  That streyght un-to the deeth myn herte sayleth.\r\n  Ther-to desyr so brenningly me assaylleth,\r\n  That to ben slayn it were a gretter Ioye\r\n  To me than king of Grece been and Troye!\r\n\r\n  88. Suffiseth this, my fulle freend Pandare,                          610\r\n  That I have seyd, for now wostow my wo;\r\n  And for the love of god, my colde care\r\n  So hyd it wel, I telle it never to mo;\r\n  For harmes mighte folwen, mo than two,\r\n  If it were wist; but be thou in gladnesse,                            615\r\n  And lat me sterve, unknowe, of my distresse.'\r\n\r\n  89. 'How hastow thus unkindely and longe\r\n  Hid this fro me, thou fool?' quod Pandarus;\r\n  'Paraunter thou might after swich oon longe,\r\n  That myn avys anoon may helpen us.'                                   620\r\n  'This were a wonder thing,' quod Troylus,\r\n  'Thou coudest never in love thy-selven wisse;\r\n  How devel maystow bringen me to blisse?'\r\n\r\n  90. 'Ye, Troilus, now herke,' quod Pandare,\r\n  'Though I be nyce; it happeth ofte so,                                625\r\n  That oon that exces doth ful yvele fare,\r\n  By good counseyl can kepe his freend ther-fro.\r\n  I have my-self eek seyn a blind man go\r\n  Ther-as he fel that coude loke wyde;\r\n  A fool may eek a wys man ofte gyde.                                   630\r\n\r\n  91. A whetston is no kerving instrument,\r\n  And yet it maketh sharpe kerving-tolis.\r\n  And ther thow woost that I have ought miswent,\r\n  Eschewe thou that, for swich thing to thee scole is;\r\n  Thus ofte wyse men ben war by folis.                                  635\r\n  If thou do so, thy wit is wel biwared;\r\n  By his contrarie is every thing declared.\r\n\r\n  92. For how might ever sweetnesse have be knowe\r\n  To him that never tasted bitternesse?\r\n  Ne no man may be inly glad, I trowe,                                  640\r\n  That never was in sorwe or som distresse;\r\n  Eek whyt by blak, by shame eek worthinesse,\r\n  Ech set by other, more for other semeth;\r\n  As men may see; and so the wyse it demeth.\r\n\r\n  93. Sith thus of two contraries is a lore,                            645\r\n  I, that have in love so ofte assayed\r\n  Grevaunces, oughte conne, and wel the more\r\n  Counsayllen thee of that thou art amayed.\r\n  Eek thee ne oughte nat ben yvel apayed,\r\n  Though I desyre with thee for to bere                                 650\r\n  Thyn hevy charge; it shal the lasse dere.\r\n\r\n  94. I woot wel that it fareth thus by me\r\n  As to thy brother Parys an herdesse,\r\n  Which that y-cleped was Oënone,\r\n  Wrot in a compleynt of hir hevinesse:                                 655\r\n  Ye say the lettre that she wroot, y gesse?'\r\n  Nay, never yet, y-wis,' quod Troilus.\r\n  'Now,' quod Pandare, 'herkneth; it was thus.--\r\n\r\n  95. \"Phebus, that first fond art of medicyne,\"\r\n  Quod she, \"and coude in every wightes care                            660\r\n  Remede and reed, by herbes he knew fyne,\r\n  Yet to him-self his conninge was ful bare;\r\n  For love hadde him so bounden in a snare,\r\n  Al for the doughter of the kinge Admete,\r\n  That al his craft ne coude his sorwe bete.\"--                         665\r\n\r\n  96. Right so fare I, unhappily for me;\r\n  I love oon best, and that me smerteth sore;\r\n  And yet, paraunter, can I rede thee,\r\n  And not my-self; repreve me no more.\r\n  I have no cause, I woot wel, for to sore                              670\r\n  As doth an hauk that listeth for to pleye,\r\n  But to thyn help yet somwhat can I seye.\r\n\r\n  97. And of o thing right siker maystow be,\r\n  That certayn, for to deyen in the peyne,\r\n  That I shal never-mo discoveren thee;                                 675\r\n  Ne, by my trouthe, I kepe nat restreyne\r\n  Thee fro thy love, thogh that it were Eleyne,\r\n  That is thy brotheres wyf, if ich it wiste;\r\n  Be what she be, and love hir as thee liste.\r\n\r\n  98. Therfore, as freend fullich in me assure,                         680\r\n  And tel me plat what is thyn enchesoun,\r\n  And final cause of wo that ye endure;\r\n  For douteth no-thing, myn entencioun\r\n  Nis nought to yow of reprehencioun,\r\n  To speke as now, for no wight may bireve                              685\r\n  A man to love, til that him list to leve.\r\n\r\n  99. And witeth wel, that bothe two ben vyces,\r\n  Mistrusten alle, or elles alle leve;\r\n  But wel I woot, the mene of it no vyce is,\r\n  For for to trusten sum wight is a preve                               690\r\n  Of trouthe, and for-thy wolde I fayn remeve\r\n  Thy wrong conceyte, and do thee som wight triste,\r\n  Thy wo to telle; and tel me, if thee liste.\r\n\r\n  100. The wyse seyth, \"wo him that is allone,\r\n  For, and he falle, he hath noon help to ryse;\"                        695\r\n  And sith thou hast a felawe, tel thy mone;\r\n  For this nis not, certeyn, the nexte wyse\r\n  To winnen love, as techen us the wyse,\r\n  To walwe and wepe as Niobe the quene,\r\n  Whos teres yet in marbel been y-sene.                                 700\r\n\r\n  101. Lat be thy weping and thy drerinesse,\r\n  And lat us lissen wo with other speche;\r\n  So may thy woful tyme seme lesse.\r\n  Delyte not in wo thy wo to seche,\r\n  As doon thise foles that hir sorwes eche                              705\r\n  With sorwe, whan they han misaventure,\r\n  And listen nought to seche hem other cure.\r\n\r\n  102. Men seyn, \"to wrecche is consolacioun\r\n  To have an-other felawe in his peyne;\"\r\n  That oughte wel ben our opinioun,                                     710\r\n  For, bothe thou and I, of love we pleyne;\r\n  So ful of sorwe am I, soth for to seyne,\r\n  That certeynly no more harde grace\r\n  May sitte on me, for-why ther is no space.\r\n\r\n  103. If god wole thou art not agast of me,                            715\r\n  Lest I wolde of thy lady thee bigyle,\r\n  Thow wost thy-self whom that I love, pardee,\r\n  As I best can, gon sithen longe whyle.\r\n  And sith thou wost I do it for no wyle,\r\n  And sith I am he that thou tristest most,                             720\r\n  Tel me sumwhat, sin al my wo thou wost.'\r\n\r\n  104. Yet Troilus, for al this, no word seyde,\r\n  But longe he lay as stille as he ded were;\r\n  And after this with sykinge he abreyde,\r\n  And to Pandarus voys he lente his ere,                                725\r\n  And up his eyen caste he, that in fere\r\n  Was Pandarus, lest that in frenesye\r\n  He sholde falle, or elles sone dye:\r\n\r\n  105. And cryde 'a-wake' ful wonderly and sharpe;\r\n  'What? slombrestow as in a lytargye?                                  730\r\n  Or artow lyk an asse to the harpe,\r\n  That hereth soun, whan men the strenges plye,\r\n  But in his minde of that no melodye\r\n  May sinken, him to glade, for that he\r\n  So dul is of his bestialitee?'                                        735\r\n\r\n  106. And with that Pandare of his wordes stente;\r\n  But Troilus yet him no word answerde,\r\n  For-why to telle nas not his entente\r\n  To never no man, for whom that he so ferde.\r\n  For it is seyd, 'man maketh ofte a yerde                              740\r\n  With which the maker is him-self y-beten\r\n  In sondry maner,' as thise wyse treten,\r\n\r\n  107. And namely, in his counseyl tellinge\r\n  That toucheth love that oughte be secree;\r\n  For of him-self it wolde y-nough out-springe,                         745\r\n  But-if that it the bet governed be.\r\n  Eek som-tyme it is craft to seme flee\r\n  Fro thing which in effect men hunte faste;\r\n  Al this gan Troilus in his herte caste.\r\n\r\n  108. But nathelees, whan he had herd him crye                         750\r\n  'Awake!' he gan to syke wonder sore,\r\n  And seyde, 'freend, though that I stille lye,\r\n  I am not deef; now pees, and cry no more;\r\n  For I have herd thy wordes and thy lore;\r\n  But suffre me my mischef to biwayle,                                  755\r\n  For thy proverbes may me nought avayle.\r\n\r\n  109.

Quod Pandarus, 'allas! what may this be,\r\n  That thou despeyred art thus causelees?\r\n  What? liveth not thy lady? _benedicite!_                              780\r\n  How wostow so that thou art gracelees?\r\n  Swich yvel is not alwey botelees.\r\n  Why, put not impossible thus thy cure,\r\n  Sin thing to come is ofte in aventure.\r\n\r\n  113.

But ones niltow, for thy coward herte,\r\n  And for thyn ire and folish wilfulnesse,\r\n  For wantrust, tellen of thy sorwes smerte,\r\n  Ne to thyn owene help do bisinesse                                    795\r\n  As muche as speke a resoun more or lesse,\r\n  But lyest as he that list of no-thing recche.\r\n  What womman coude love swich a wrecche?\r\n\r\n  115. What may she demen other of thy deeth,\r\n  If thou thus deye, and she not why it is,                             800\r\n  But that for fere is yolden up thy breeth,\r\n  For Grekes han biseged us, y-wis?\r\n  Lord, which a thank than shaltow han of this!\r\n  Thus wol she seyn, and al the toun at ones,\r\n  \"The wrecche is deed, the devel have his bones!\"                      805\r\n\r\n  116. Thou mayst allone here wepe and crye and knele;\r\n  But, love a woman that she woot it nought,\r\n  And she wol quyte that thou shalt not fele;\r\n  Unknowe, unkist, and lost that is un-sought.\r\n  What! many a man hath love ful dere y-bought                          810\r\n  Twenty winter that his lady wiste,\r\n  That never yet his lady mouth he kiste.\r\n\r\n  117. What? shulde he therfor fallen in despeyr,\r\n  Or be recreaunt for his owene tene,\r\n  Or sleen him-self, al be his lady fayr?                               815\r\n  Nay, nay, but ever in oon be fresh and grene\r\n  To serve and love his dere hertes quene,\r\n  And thenke it is a guerdoun hir to serve\r\n  A thousand-fold more than he can deserve.'\r\n\r\n  118. And of that word took hede Troilus,                              820\r\n  And thoughte anoon what folye he was inne,\r\n  And how that sooth him seyde Pandarus,\r\n  That for to sleen him-self mighte he not winne,\r\n  But bothe doon unmanhod and a sinne,\r\n  And of his deeth his lady nought to wyte;                             825\r\n  For of his wo, god woot, she knew ful lyte.\r\n\r\n  119. And with that thought he gan ful sore syke,\r\n  And seyde, 'allas! what is me best to do?'\r\n  To whom Pandare answerde, 'if thee lyke,\r\n  The best is that thou telle me thy wo;                                830\r\n  And have my trouthe, but thou it finde so,\r\n  I be thy bote, or that it be ful longe,\r\n  To peces do me drawe, and sithen honge!'\r\n\r\n  120. 'Ye, so thou seyst,' quod Troilus tho, 'allas!\r\n  But, god wot, it is not the rather so;                                835\r\n  Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas,\r\n  For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo,\r\n  Ne alle the men that ryden conne or go\r\n  May of hir cruel wheel the harm withstonde;\r\n  For, as hir list, she pleyeth with free and bonde.'                   840\r\n\r\n  121. Quod Pandarus, 'than blamestow Fortune\r\n  For thou art wrooth, ye, now at erst I see;\r\n  Wostow nat wel that Fortune is commune\r\n  To every maner wight in som degree?\r\n  And yet thou hast this comfort, lo, pardee!                           845\r\n  That, as hir Ioyes moten over-goon,\r\n  So mote hir sorwes passen everichoon.\r\n\r\n  122. For if hir wheel stinte any-thing to torne,\r\n  Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be:\r\n  Now, sith hir wheel by no wey may soiorne,                            850\r\n  What wostow if hir mutabilitee\r\n  Right as thy-selven list, wol doon by thee,\r\n  Or that she be not fer fro thyn helpinge?\r\n  Paraunter, thou hast cause for to singe!\r\n\r\n  123. And therfor wostow what I thee beseche?                          855\r\n  Lat be thy wo and turning to the grounde;\r\n  For who-so list have helping of his leche,\r\n  To him bihoveth first unwrye his wounde.\r\n  To Cerberus in helle ay be I bounde,\r\n  Were it for my suster, al thy sorwe,                                  860\r\n  By my wil, she sholde al be thyn to-morwe.\r\n\r\n  124. Loke up, I seye, and tel me what she is\r\n  Anoon, that I may goon aboute thy nede;\r\n  Knowe ich hir ought? for my love, tel me this;\r\n  Than wolde I hopen rather for to spede.'                              865\r\n  Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede,\r\n  For he was hit, and wex al reed for shame;\r\n  'A ha!' quod Pandare, 'here biginneth game!'\r\n\r\n  125. And with that word he gan him for to shake,\r\n  And seyde, 'theef, thou shalt hir name telle.'                        870\r\n  But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake\r\n  As though men sholde han lad him in-to helle,\r\n  And seyde, 'allas! of al my wo the welle,\r\n  Than is my swete fo called Criseyde!'\r\n  And wel nigh with the word for fere he deyde.                         875\r\n\r\n  126. And whan that Pandare herde hir name nevene,\r\n  Lord, he was glad, and seyde, 'freend so dere,\r\n  Now fare a-right, for Ioves name in hevene,\r\n  Love hath biset the wel, be of good chere;\r\n  For of good name and wysdom and manere                                880\r\n  She hath y-nough, and eek of gentilesse;\r\n  If she be fayr, thow wost thy-self, I gesse.\r\n\r\n  127. Ne I never saw a more bountevous\r\n  Of hir estat, ne a gladder, ne of speche\r\n  A freendlier, ne a more gracious                                      885\r\n  For to do wel, ne lasse hadde nede to seche\r\n  What for to doon; and al this bet to eche,\r\n  In honour, to as fer as she may strecche,\r\n  A kinges herte semeth by hires a wrecche.\r\n\r\n  128. And for-thy loke of good comfort thou be;                        890\r\n  For certeinly, the firste poynt is this\r\n  Of noble corage and wel ordeynè,\r\n  A man to have pees with him-self, y-wis;\r\n  So oughtest thou, for nought but good it is\r\n  To loven wel, and in a worthy place;                                  895\r\n  Thee oughte not to clepe it hap, but grace.\r\n\r\n  129. And also thenk, and ther-with glade thee,\r\n  That sith thy lady vertuous is al,\r\n  So folweth it that ther is som pitee\r\n  Amonges alle thise othere in general;                                 900\r\n  And for-thy see that thou, in special,\r\n  Requere nought that is ayein hir name;\r\n  For vertue streccheth not him-self to shame.\r\n\r\n  130. But wel is me that ever I was born,\r\n  That thou biset art in so good a place;                               905\r\n  For by my trouthe, in love I dorste have sworn,\r\n  Thee sholde never han tid thus fayr a grace;\r\n  And wostow why? for thou were wont to chace\r\n  At love in scorn, and for despyt him calle\r\n  \"Seynt Idiot, lord of thise foles alle.\"                              910\r\n\r\n  131. How often hastow maad thy nyce Iapes,\r\n  And seyd, that loves servants everichone\r\n  Of nycetee ben verray goddes apes;\r\n  And some wolde monche hir mete alone,\r\n  Ligging a-bedde, and make hem for to grone;                           915\r\n  And som, thou seydest, hadde a blaunche fevere,\r\n  And preydest god he sholde never kevere!\r\n\r\n  132. And some of hem toke on hem, for the colde,\r\n  More than y-nough, so seydestow ful ofte;\r\n  And some han feyned ofte tyme, and tolde                              920\r\n  How that they wake, whan they slepen softe;\r\n  And thus they wolde han brought hem-self a-lofte,\r\n  And nathelees were under at the laste;\r\n  Thus seydestow, and Iapedest ful faste.\r\n\r\n  133. Yet seydestow, that, for the more part,                          925\r\n  These loveres wolden speke in general,\r\n  And thoughten that it was a siker art,\r\n  For fayling, for to assayen over-al.\r\n  Now may I iape of thee, if that I shal!\r\n  But nathelees, though that I sholde deye,                             930\r\n  That thou art noon of tho, that dorste I seye.\r\n\r\n  134. Now beet thy brest, and sey to god of love,\r\n  \"Thy grace, lord! for now I me repente\r\n  If I mis spak, for now my-self I love:\"\r\n  Thus sey with al thyn herte in good entente.'                         935\r\n  Quod Troilus, 'a! lord! I me consente,\r\n  And pray to thee my Iapes thou foryive,\r\n  And I shal never-more whyl I live.'\r\n\r\n  135. 'Thow seyst wel,' quod Pandare, 'and now I hope\r\n  That thou the goddes wraththe hast al apesed;                         940\r\n  And sithen thou hast wepen many a drope,\r\n  And seyd swich thing wher-with thy god is plesed,\r\n  Now wolde never god but thou were esed;\r\n  And think wel, she of whom rist al thy wo\r\n  Here-after may thy comfort been al-so.                                945\r\n\r\n  136. For thilke ground, that bereth the wedes wikke,\r\n  Bereth eek thise holsom herbes, as ful ofte\r\n  Next the foule netle, rough and thikke,\r\n  The rose waxeth swote and smothe and softe;\r\n  And next the valey is the hil a-lofte;                                950\r\n  And next the derke night the glade morwe;\r\n  And also Ioye is next the fyn of sorwe.\r\n\r\n  137. Now loke that atempre be thy brydel,\r\n  And, for the beste, ay suffre to the tyde,\r\n  Or elles al our labour is on ydel;                                    955\r\n  He hasteth wel that wysly can abyde;\r\n  Be diligent, and trewe, and ay wel hyde.\r\n  Be lusty, free, persevere in thy servyse,\r\n  And al is wel, if thou werke in this wyse.\r\n\r\n  138. But he that parted is in every place                             960\r\n  Is no-wher hool, as writen clerkes wyse;\r\n  What wonder is, though swich oon have no grace?\r\n  Eek wostow how it fareth of som servyse?\r\n  As plaunte a tre or herbe, in sondry wyse,\r\n  And on the morwe pulle it up as blyve,                                965\r\n  No wonder is, though it may never thryve.\r\n\r\n  139. And sith that god of love hath thee bistowed\r\n  In place digne un-to thy worthinesse,\r\n  Stond faste, for to good port hastow rowed;\r\n  And of thy-self, for any hevinesse,                                   970\r\n  Hope alwey wel; for, but-if drerinesse\r\n  Or over-haste our bothe labour shende,\r\n  I hope of this to maken a good ende.\r\n\r\n  140. And wostow why I am the lasse a-fered\r\n  Of this matere with my nece trete?                                    975\r\n  For this have I herd seyd of wyse y-lered,\r\n  \"Was never man ne woman yet bigete\r\n  That was unapt to suffren loves hete\r\n  Celestial, or elles love of kinde;\"\r\n  For-thy som grace I hope in hir to finde.                             980\r\n\r\n  141. And for to speke of hir in special,\r\n  Hir beautee to bithinken and hir youthe,\r\n  It sit hir nought to be celestial\r\n  As yet, though that hir liste bothe and couthe;\r\n  But trewely, it sete hir wel right nouthe                             985\r\n  A worthy knight to loven and cheryce,\r\n  And but she do, I holde it for a vyce.\r\n\r\n  142. Wherfore I am, and wol be, ay redy\r\n  To peyne me to do yow this servyse;\r\n  For bothe yow to plese thus hope I                                    990\r\n  Her-afterward; for ye beth bothe wyse,\r\n  And conne it counseyl kepe in swich a wyse,\r\n  That no man shal the wyser of it be;\r\n  And so we may be gladed alle three.\r\n\r\n  143. And, by my trouthe, I have right now of thee                     995\r\n  A good conceyt in my wit, as I gesse,\r\n  And what it is, I wol now that thou see.\r\n  I thenke, sith that love, of his goodnesse,\r\n  Hath thee converted out of wikkednesse,\r\n  That thou shalt be the beste post, I leve,                           1000\r\n  Of al his lay, and most his foos to-greve.\r\n\r\n  144. Ensample why, see now these wyse clerkes,\r\n  That erren aldermost a-yein a lawe,\r\n  And ben converted from hir wikked werkes\r\n  Thorugh grace of god, that list hem to him drawe,                    1005\r\n  Than arn they folk that han most god in awe,\r\n  And strengest-feythed been, I understonde,\r\n  And conne an errour alder-best withstonde.'\r\n\r\n  145. Whan Troilus had herd Pandare assented\r\n  To been his help in loving of Criseyde,                              1010\r\n  Wex of his wo, as who seyth, untormented,\r\n  But hotter wex his love, and thus he seyde,\r\n  With sobre chere, al-though his herte pleyde,\r\n  'Now blisful Venus helpe, er that I sterve,\r\n  Of thee, Pandare, I may som thank deserve.                           1015\r\n\r\n  146. But, dere frend, how shal myn wo ben lesse\r\n  Til this be doon? and goode, eek tel me this,\r\n  How wiltow seyn of me and my destresse?\r\n  Lest she be wrooth, this drede I most, y-wis,\r\n  Or nil not here or trowen how it is.                                 1020\r\n  Al this drede I, and eek for the manere\r\n  Of thee, hir eem, she nil no swich thing here.'\r\n\r\n  147. Quod Pandarus, 'thou hast a ful gret care\r\n  Lest that the cherl may falle out of the mone!\r\n  Why, lord!

But herke, Pandare, o word, for I nolde                         1030\r\n  That thou in me wendest so greet folye,\r\n  That to my lady I desiren sholde\r\n  That toucheth harm or any vilenye;\r\n  For dredelees, me were lever dye\r\n  Than she of me ought elles understode                                1035\r\n  But that, that mighte sounen in-to gode.'\r\n\r\n  149.

For every wight that hath an hous to founde                     1065\r\n  Ne renneth nought the werk for to biginne\r\n  With rakel hond, but he wol byde a stounde,\r\n  And sende his hertes lyne out fro with-inne\r\n  Alderfirst his purpos for to winne.\r\n  Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte,                               1070\r\n  And caste his werk ful wysly, or he wroughte.\r\n\r\n  154.

This Troilus sat on his baye stede,\r\n  Al armed, save his heed, ful richely,                                 625\r\n  And wounded was his hors, and gan to blede,\r\n  On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely;\r\n  But swych a knightly sighte, trewely,\r\n  As was on him, was nought, with-outen faile,\r\n  To loke on Mars, that god is of batayle.                              630\r\n\r\n  91. So lyk a man of armes and a knight\r\n  He was to seen, fulfild of heigh prowesse;\r\n  For bothe he hadde a body and a might\r\n  To doon that thing, as wel as hardinesse;\r\n  And eek to seen him in his gere him dresse,                           635\r\n  So fresh, so yong, so weldy semed he,\r\n  It was an heven up-on him for to see.\r\n\r\n  92. His helm to-hewen was in twenty places,\r\n  That by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde,\r\n  His sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces,                      640\r\n  In which men mighte many an arwe finde\r\n  That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde;\r\n  And ay the peple cryde, 'here cometh our Ioye,\r\n  And, next his brother, holdere up of Troye!'\r\n\r\n  93. For which he wex a litel reed for shame,                          645\r\n  Whan he the peple up-on him herde cryen,\r\n  That to biholde it was a noble game,\r\n  How sobreliche he caste doun his yën.\r\n  Cryseyda gan al his chere aspyen,\r\n  And leet so softe it in hir herte sinke,                              650\r\n  That to hir-self she seyde, 'who yaf me drinke?'\r\n\r\n  94. For of hir owene thought she wex al reed,\r\n  Remembringe hir right thus, 'lo, this is he\r\n  Which that myn uncle swereth he moot be deed,\r\n  But I on him have mercy and pitee;'                                   655\r\n  And with that thought, for pure a-shamed, she\r\n  Gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste,\r\n  Whyl he and al the peple for-by paste,\r\n\r\n  95. And gan to caste and rollen up and doun\r\n  With-inne hir thought his excellent prowesse,                         660\r\n  And his estat, and also his renoun,\r\n  His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse;\r\n  But most hir favour was, for his distresse\r\n  Was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe\r\n  To sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe.                         665\r\n\r\n  96. Now mighte som envyous Iangle thus,\r\n  'This was a sodeyn love, how mighte it be\r\n  That she so lightly lovede Troilus\r\n  Right for the firste sighte; ye, pardee?'\r\n  Now who-so seyth so, mote he never thee!                              670\r\n  For every thing, a ginning hath it nede\r\n  Er al be wrought, with-outen any drede.\r\n\r\n  97. For I sey nought that she so sodeynly\r\n  Yaf him hir love, but that she gan enclyne\r\n  To lyke him first, and I have told yow why;                           675\r\n  And after that, his manhod and his pyne\r\n  Made love with-inne hir for to myne,\r\n  For which, by proces and by good servyse,\r\n  He gat hir love, and in no sodeyn wyse.\r\n\r\n  98. And also blisful Venus, wel arayed,                               680\r\n  Sat in hir seventhe hous of hevene tho,\r\n  Disposed wel, and with aspectes payed,\r\n  To helpen sely Troilus of his wo.\r\n  And, sooth to seyn, she nas nat al a fo\r\n  To Troilus in his nativitee;                                          685\r\n  God woot that wel the soner spedde he.\r\n\r\n  99. Now lat us stinte of Troilus a throwe,\r\n  That rydeth forth, and lat us tourne faste\r\n  Un-to Criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe,\r\n  Ther-as she sat allone, and gan to caste                              690\r\n  Wher-on she wolde apoynte hir at the laste,\r\n  If it so were hir eem ne wolde cesse,\r\n  For Troilus, up-on hir for to presse.\r\n\r\n  100. And, lord! so she gan in hir thought argue\r\n  In this matere of which I have yow told,                              695\r\n  And what to doon best were, and what eschue,\r\n  That plyted she ful ofte in many fold.\r\n  Now was hir herte warm, now was it cold,\r\n  And what she thoughte somwhat shal I wryte,\r\n  As to myn auctor listeth for to endyte.                               700\r\n\r\n  101. She thoughte wel, that Troilus persone\r\n  She knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse,\r\n  And thus she seyde, 'al were it nought to done,\r\n  To graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse,\r\n  It were honour, with pley and with gladnesse,                         705\r\n  In honestee, with swich a lord to dele,\r\n  For myn estat, and also for his hele.\r\n\r\n  102. Eek, wel wot I my kinges sone is he;\r\n  And sith he hath to see me swich delyt,\r\n  If I wolde utterly his sighte flee,                                   710\r\n  Paraunter he mighte have me in dispyt,\r\n  Thurgh which I mighte stonde in worse plyt;\r\n  Now were I wys, me hate to purchace,\r\n  With-outen nede, ther I may stonde in grace?\r\n\r\n  103. In every thing, I woot, ther lyth mesure.                        715\r\n  For though a man forbede dronkenesse,\r\n  He nought for-bet that every creature\r\n  Be drinkelees for alwey, as I gesse;\r\n  Eek sith I woot for me is his distresse,\r\n  I ne oughte not for that thing him despyse,                           720\r\n  Sith it is so, he meneth in good wyse.\r\n\r\n  104. And eek I knowe, of longe tyme agoon,\r\n  His thewes goode, and that he is not nyce.\r\n  Ne avauntour, seyth men, certein, is he noon;\r\n  To wys is he to do so gret a vyce;                                    725\r\n  Ne als I nel him never so cheryce,\r\n  That he may make avaunt, by Iuste cause;\r\n  He shal me never binde in swiche a clause.\r\n\r\n  105. Now set a cas, the hardest is, y-wis,\r\n  Men mighten deme that he loveth me:                                   730\r\n  What dishonour were it un-to me, this?\r\n  May I him lette of that? why nay, pardee!\r\n  I knowe also, and alday here and see,\r\n  Men loven wommen al this toun aboute;\r\n  Be they the wers? why, nay, with-outen doute.                         735\r\n\r\n  106. I thenk eek how he able is for to have\r\n  Of al this noble toun the thriftieste,\r\n  To been his love, so she hir honour save;\r\n  For out and out he is the worthieste,\r\n  Save only Ector, which that is the beste.                             740\r\n  And yet his lyf al lyth now in my cure,\r\n  But swich is love, and eek myn aventure.\r\n\r\n  107. Ne me to love, a wonder is it nought;\r\n  For wel wot I my-self, so god me spede,\r\n  Al wolde I that noon wistë of this thought,                           745\r\n  I am oon the fayreste, out of drede,\r\n  And goodlieste, who-so taketh hede;\r\n  And so men seyn in al the toun of Troye.\r\n  What wonder is it though he of me have Ioye?\r\n\r\n  108. I am myn owene woman, wel at ese,                                750\r\n  I thank it god, as after myn estat;\r\n  Right yong, and stonde unteyd in lusty lese,\r\n  With-outen Ialousye or swich debat;\r\n  Shal noon housbonde seyn to me \"chekmat!\"\r\n  For either they ben ful of Ialousye,                                  755\r\n  Or maisterful, or loven novelrye.\r\n\r\n  109. What shal I doon? to what fyn live I thus?\r\n  Shal I nat loven, in cas if that me leste?\r\n  What, _par dieux_! I am nought religious!\r\n  And though that I myn herte sette at reste                            760\r\n  Upon this knight, that is the worthieste,\r\n  And kepe alwey myn honour and my name,\r\n  By alle right, it may do me no shame.'\r\n\r\n  110. But right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte,\r\n  In March, that chaungeth ofte tyme his face,                          765\r\n  And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte\r\n  Which over-sprat the sonne as for a space,\r\n  A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,\r\n  That over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle,\r\n  So that for fere almost she gan to falle.                             770\r\n\r\n  111. That thought was this, 'allas! sin I am free,\r\n  Sholde I now love, and putte in Iupartye\r\n  My sikernesse, and thrallen libertee?\r\n  Allas! how dorste I thenken that folye?\r\n  May I nought wel in other folk aspye                                  775\r\n  Hir dredful Ioye, hir constreynt, and hir peyne?\r\n  Ther loveth noon, that she nath why to pleyne.\r\n\r\n  112. For love is yet the moste stormy lyf,\r\n  Right of him-self, that ever was bigonne;\r\n  For ever som mistrust, or nyce stryf,                                 780\r\n  Ther is in love, som cloud is over the sonne:\r\n  Ther-to we wrecched wommen no-thing conne,\r\n  Whan us is wo, but wepe and sitte and thinke;\r\n  Our wreche is this, our owene wo to drinke.\r\n\r\n  113. Also these wikked tonges been so prest                           785\r\n  To speke us harm, eek men be so untrewe,\r\n  That, right anoon as cessed is hir lest,\r\n  So cesseth love, and forth to love a newe:\r\n  But harm y-doon, is doon, who-so it rewe.\r\n  For though these men for love hem first to-rende,                     790\r\n  Ful sharp biginning breketh ofte at ende.\r\n\r\n  114. How ofte tyme hath it y-knowen be,\r\n  The treson, that to womman hath be do?\r\n  To what fyn is swich love, I can nat see,\r\n  Or wher bicomth it, whan it is ago;                                   795\r\n  Ther is no wight that woot, I trowe so,\r\n  Wher it bycomth; lo, no wight on it sporneth;\r\n  That erst was no-thing, in-to nought it torneth.\r\n\r\n  115. How bisy, if I love, eek moste I be\r\n  To plesen hem that Iangle of love, and demen,                         800\r\n  And coye hem, that they sey non harm of me?\r\n  For though ther be no cause, yet hem semen\r\n  Al be for harm that folk hir freendes quemen;\r\n  And who may stoppen every wikked tonge,\r\n  Or soun of belles whyl that they be ronge?'                           805\r\n\r\n  116. And after that, hir thought bigan to clere,\r\n  And seyde, 'he which that no-thing under-taketh,\r\n  No-thing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.'\r\n  And with an other thought hir herte quaketh;\r\n  Than slepeth hope, and after dreed awaketh;                           810\r\n  Now hoot, now cold; but thus, bi-twixen tweye,\r\n  She rist hir up, and went hir for to pleye.\r\n\r\n  117. Adoun the steyre anoon-right tho she wente\r\n  In-to the gardin, with hir neces three,\r\n  And up and doun ther made many a wente,                               815\r\n  Flexippe, she, Tharbe, and Antigone,\r\n  To pleyen, that it Ioye was to see;\r\n  And othere of hir wommen, a gret route,\r\n  Hir folwede in the gardin al aboute.\r\n\r\n  118. This yerd was large, and rayled alle the aleyes,                 820\r\n  And shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene,\r\n  And benched newe, and sonded alle the weyes,\r\n  In which she walketh arm in arm bi-twene;\r\n  Til at the laste Antigone the shene\r\n  Gan on a Troian song to singe clere,                                  825\r\n  That it an heven was hir voys to here.--\r\n\r\n  119. She seyde, 'O love, to whom I have and shal\r\n  Ben humble subgit, trewe in myn entente,\r\n  As I best can, to yow, lord, yeve ich al\r\n  For ever-more, myn hertes lust to rente.                              830\r\n  For never yet thy grace no wight sente\r\n  So blisful cause as me, my lyf to lede\r\n  In alle Ioye and seurtee, out of drede.\r\n\r\n  120. Ye, blisful god, han me so wel beset\r\n  In love, y-wis, that al that bereth lyf                               835\r\n  Imaginen ne cowde how to ben bet;\r\n  For, lord, with-outen Ialousye or stryf,\r\n  I love oon which that is most ententyf\r\n  To serven wel, unwery or unfeyned,\r\n  That ever was, and leest with harm distreyned.                        840\r\n\r\n  121. As he that is the welle of worthinesse,\r\n  Of trouthe ground, mirour of goodliheed,\r\n  Of wit Appollo, stoon of sikernesse,\r\n  Of vertu rote, of lust findere and heed,\r\n  Thurgh which is alle sorwe fro me deed,                               845\r\n  Y-wis, I love him best, so doth he me;\r\n  Now good thrift have he, wher-so that he be!\r\n\r\n  122. Whom sholde I thanke but yow, god of love,\r\n  Of al this blisse, in which to bathe I ginne?\r\n  And thanked be ye, lord, for that I love!                             850\r\n  This is the righte lyf that I am inne,\r\n  To flemen alle manere vyce and sinne:\r\n  This doth me so to vertu for to entende,\r\n  That day by day I in my wil amende.\r\n\r\n  123. And who-so seyth that for to love is vyce,                       855\r\n  Or thraldom, though he fele in it distressse,\r\n  He outher is envyous, or right nyce,\r\n  Or is unmighty, for his shrewednesse,\r\n  To loven; for swich maner folk, I gesse,\r\n  Defamen love, as no-thing of him knowe;                               860\r\n  They speken, but they bente never his bowe.\r\n\r\n  124. What is the sonne wers, of kinde righte,\r\n  Though that a man, for feblesse of his yën,\r\n  May nought endure on it to see for brighte?\r\n  Or love the wers, though wrecches on it cryen?                        865\r\n  No wele is worth, that may no sorwe dryen.\r\n  And for-thy, who that hath an heed of verre,\r\n  Fro cast of stones war him in the werre!\r\n\r\n  125. But I with al myn herte and al my might,\r\n  As I have seyd, wol love, un-to my laste,                             870\r\n  My dere herte, and al myn owene knight,\r\n  In which myn herte growen is so faste,\r\n  And his in me, that it shal ever laste.\r\n  Al dredde I first to love him to biginne,\r\n  Now woot I wel, ther is no peril inne.'                               875\r\n\r\n  126. And of hir song right with that word she stente,\r\n  And therwith-al, 'now, nece,' quod Criseyde,\r\n  'Who made this song with so good entente?'\r\n  Antigone answerde anoon, and seyde,\r\n  'Ma dame, y-wis, the goodlieste mayde                                 880\r\n  Of greet estat in al the toun of Troye;\r\n  And let hir lyf in most honour and Ioye.'\r\n\r\n  127. 'Forsothe, so it semeth by hir song,'\r\n  Quod tho Criseyde, and gan ther-with to syke,\r\n  And seyde, 'lord, is there swich blisse among                         885\r\n  These lovers, as they conne faire endyte?'\r\n  'Ye, wis,' quod fresh Antigone the whyte,\r\n  'For alle the folk that han or been on lyve\r\n  Ne conne wel the blisse of love discryve.\r\n\r\n  128. But wene ye that every wrecche woot                              890\r\n  The parfit blisse of love? why, nay, y-wis;\r\n  They wenen al be love, if oon be hoot;\r\n  Do wey, do wey, they woot no-thing of this!\r\n  Men mosten axe at seyntes if it is\r\n  Aught fair in hevene; why? for they conne telle;                      895\r\n  And axen fendes, is it foul in helle.'\r\n\r\n  129. Criseyde un-to that purpos nought answerde,\r\n  But seyde, 'y-wis, it wol be night as faste.'\r\n  But every word which that she of hir herde,\r\n  She gan to prenten in hir herte faste;                                900\r\n  And ay gan love hir lasse for to agaste\r\n  Than it dide erst, and sinken in hir herte,\r\n  That she wex somwhat able to converte.\r\n\r\n  130. The dayes honour, and the hevenes yë,\r\n  The nightes fo, al this clepe I the sonne,                            905\r\n  Gan westren faste, and dounward for to wrye,\r\n  As he that hadde his dayes cours y-ronne;\r\n  And whyte thinges wexen dimme and donne\r\n  For lak of light, and sterres for to appere,\r\n  That she and al hir folk in wente y-fere.                             910\r\n\r\n  131. So whan it lyked hir to goon to reste,\r\n  And voyded weren they that voyden oughte,\r\n  She seyde, that to slepe wel hir leste.\r\n  Hir wommen sone til hir bed hir broughte.\r\n  Whan al was hust, than lay she stille, and thoughte                   915\r\n  Of al this thing the manere and the wyse.\r\n  Reherce it nedeth nought, for ye ben wyse.\r\n\r\n  132. A nightingale, upon a cedre grene,\r\n  Under the chambre-wal ther as she lay,\r\n  Ful loude sang ayein the mone shene,                                  920\r\n  Paraunter, in his briddes wyse, a lay\r\n  Of love, that made hir herte fresh and gay.\r\n  That herkned she so longe in good entente,\r\n  Til at the laste the dede sleep hir hente.\r\n\r\n  133. And, as she sleep, anoon-right tho hir mette,                    925\r\n  How that an egle, fethered whyt as boon,\r\n  Under hir brest his longe clawes sette,\r\n  And out hir herte he rente, and that a-noon,\r\n  And dide his herte in-to hir brest to goon,\r\n  Of which she nought agroos ne no-thing smerte,                        930\r\n  And forth he fleigh, with herte left for herte.\r\n\r\n  134. Now lat hir slepe, and we our tales holde\r\n  Of Troilus, that is to paleys riden,\r\n  Fro the scarmuch, of the whiche I tolde,\r\n  And in his chambre sit, and hath abiden                               935\r\n  Til two or three of his messages yeden\r\n  For Pandarus, and soughten him ful faste,\r\n  Til they him founde, and broughte him at the laste.\r\n\r\n  135. This Pandarus com leping in at ones\r\n  And seide thus, 'who hath ben wel y-bete                              940\r\n  To-day with swerdes, and with slinge-stones,\r\n  But Troilus, that hath caught him an hete?'\r\n  And gan to Iape, and seyde, 'lord, so ye swete!\r\n  But rys, and lat us soupe and go to reste;'\r\n  And he answerde him, 'do we as thee leste.'                           945\r\n\r\n  136. With al the haste goodly that they mighte,\r\n  They spedde hem fro the souper un-to bedde;\r\n  And every wight out at the dore him dighte,\r\n  And wher him list upon his wey he spedde;\r\n  But Troilus, that thoughte his herte bledde                           950\r\n  For wo, til that he herde som tydinge,\r\n  He seyde, 'freend, shal I now wepe or singe?'\r\n\r\n  137. Quod Pandarus, 'ly stille, and lat me slepe,\r\n  And don thyn hood, thy nedes spedde be;\r\n  And chese, if thou wolt singe or daunce or lepe;                      955\r\n  At shorte wordes, thow shall trowe me.--\r\n  Sire, my nece wol do wel by thee,\r\n  And love thee best, by god and by my trouthe,\r\n  But lak of pursuit make it in thy slouthe.\r\n\r\n  138. For thus ferforth I have thy work bigonne,                       960\r\n  Fro day to day, til this day, by the morwe,\r\n  Hir love of freendship have I to thee wonne,\r\n  And also hath she leyd hir feyth to borwe.\r\n  Algate a foot is hameled of thy sorwe.'\r\n  What sholde I lenger sermon of it holde?                              965\r\n  As ye han herd bifore, al he him tolde.\r\n\r\n  139. But right as floures, thorugh the colde of night\r\n  Y-closed, stoupen on hir stalkes lowe,\r\n  Redressen hem a-yein the sonne bright,\r\n  And spreden on hir kinde cours by rowe;                               970\r\n  Right so gan tho his eyen up to throwe\r\n  This Troilus, and seyde, 'O Venus dere,\r\n  Thy might, thy grace, y-heried be it here!'\r\n\r\n  140. And to Pandare he held up bothe his hondes,\r\n  And seyde, 'lord, al thyn be that I have;                             975\r\n  For I am hool, al brosten been my bondes;\r\n  A thousand Troians who so that me yave,\r\n  Eche after other, god so wis me save,\r\n  Ne mighte me so gladen; lo, myn herte,\r\n  It spredeth so for Ioye, it wol to-sterte!                            980\r\n\r\n  141. But lord, how shal I doon, how shal I liven?\r\n  Whan shal I next my dere herte see?\r\n  How shal this longe tyme a-wey be driven,\r\n  Til that thou be ayein at hir fro me?\r\n  Thou mayst answere, \"a-byd, a-byd,\" but he                            985\r\n  That hangeth by the nekke, sooth to seyne,\r\n  In grete disese abydeth for the peyne.'\r\n\r\n  142. 'Al esily, now, for the love of Marte,'\r\n  Quod Pandarus, 'for every thing hath tyme;\r\n  So longe abyd til that the night departe;                             990\r\n  For al so siker as thow lyst here by me,\r\n  And god toforn, I wol be there at pryme,\r\n  And for thy werk somwhat as I shal seye,\r\n  Or on som other wight this charge leye.\r\n\r\n  143. For pardee, god wot, I have ever yit                             995\r\n  Ben redy thee to serve, and to this night\r\n  Have I nought fayned, but emforth my wit\r\n  Don al thy lust, and shal with al my might.\r\n  Do now as I shal seye, and fare a-right;\r\n  And if thou nilt, wyte al thy-self thy care,                         1000\r\n  On me is nought along thyn yvel fare.\r\n\r\n  144. I woot wel that thow wyser art than I\r\n  A thousand fold, but if I were as thou,\r\n  God helpe me so, as I wolde outrely,\r\n  Right of myn owene hond, wryte hir right now                         1005\r\n  A lettre, in which I wolde hir tellen how\r\n  I ferde amis, and hir beseche of routhe;\r\n  Now help thy-self, and leve it not for slouthe.\r\n\r\n  145. And I my-self shal ther-with to hir goon;\r\n  And whan thou wost that I am with hir there,                         1010\r\n  Worth thou up-on a courser right anoon,\r\n  Ye, hardily, right in thy beste gere,\r\n  And ryd forth by the place, as nought ne were,\r\n  And thou shalt finde us, if I may, sittinge\r\n  At som windowe, in-to the strete lokinge.                            1015\r\n\r\n  146. And if thee list, than maystow us saluwe,\r\n  And up-on me makë thy contenaunce;\r\n  But, by thy lyf, be war and faste eschuwe\r\n  To tarien ought, god shilde us fro mischaunce!\r\n  Ryd forth thy wey, and hold thy governaunce;                         1020\r\n  And we shal speke of thee som-what, I trowe,\r\n  Whan thou art goon, to do thyne eres glowe!\r\n\r\n  147. Touching thy lettre, thou art wys y-nough,\r\n  I woot thow nilt it digneliche endyte;\r\n  As make it with thise argumentes tough;                              1025\r\n  Ne scrivenish or craftily thou it wryte;\r\n  Beblotte it with thy teres eek a lyte;\r\n  And if thou wryte a goodly word al softe,\r\n  Though it be good, reherce it not to ofte.\r\n\r\n  148. For though the beste harpour upon lyve                          1030\r\n  Wolde on the beste souned Ioly harpe\r\n  That ever was, with alle his fingres fyve,\r\n  Touche ay o streng, or ay o werbul harpe,\r\n  Were his nayles poynted never so sharpe,\r\n  It shulde maken every wight to dulle,                                1035\r\n  To here his glee, and of his strokes fulle.\r\n\r\n  149. Ne Iompre eek no discordaunt thing y-fere,\r\n  As thus, to usen termes of phisyk;\r\n  In loves termes, hold of thy matere\r\n  The forme alwey, and do that it be lyk;                              1040\r\n  For if a peyntour wolde peynte a pyk\r\n  With asses feet, and hede it as an ape,\r\n  It cordeth nought; so nere it but a Iape.'\r\n\r\n  150. This counseyl lyked wel to Troilus;\r\n  But, as a dreedful lover, he seyde this:--                           1045\r\n  'Allas, my dere brother Pandarus,\r\n  I am ashamed for to wryte, y-wis,\r\n  Lest of myn innocence I seyde a-mis,\r\n  Or that she nolde it for despyt receyve;\r\n  Thanne were I deed, ther mighte it no-thing weyve.'                  1050\r\n\r\n  151. To that Pandare answerde, 'if thee lest,\r\n  Do that I seye, and lat me therwith goon;\r\n  For by that lord that formed est and west,\r\n  I hope of it to bringe answere anoon\r\n  Right of hir hond, and if that thou nilt noon,                       1055\r\n  Lat be; and sory mote he been his lyve,\r\n  Ayeins thy lust that helpeth thee to thryve.'\r\n\r\n  152. Quod Troilus, '_Depardieux_, I assente;\r\n  Sin that thee list, I will aryse and wryte;\r\n  And blisful god preye ich, with good entente,                        1060\r\n  The vyage, and the lettre I shal endyte,\r\n  So spede it; and thou, Minerva, the whyte,\r\n  Yif thou me wit my lettre to devyse:'\r\n  And sette him doun, and wroot right in this wyse.--\r\n\r\n  153. First he gan hir his righte lady calle,                         1065\r\n  His hertes lyf, his lust, his sorwes leche,\r\n  His blisse, and eek this othere termes alle,\r\n  That in swich cas these loveres alle seche;\r\n  And in ful humble wyse, as in his speche,\r\n  He gan him recomaunde un-to hir grace;                               1070\r\n  To telle al how, it axeth muchel space.\r\n\r\n  154. And after this, ful lowly he hir prayde\r\n  To be nought wrooth, though he, of his folye,\r\n  So hardy was to hir to wryte, and seyde,\r\n  That love it made, or elles moste he dye,                            1075\r\n  And pitously gan mercy for to crye;\r\n  And after that he seyde, and ley ful loude,\r\n  Him-self was litel worth, and lesse he coude;\r\n\r\n  155. And that she sholde han his conning excused,\r\n  That litel was, and eek he dredde hir so,                            1080\r\n  And his unworthinesse he ay acused;\r\n  And after that, than gan he telle his wo;\r\n  But that was endeles, with-outen ho;\r\n  And seyde, he wolde in trouthe alwey him holde;--\r\n  And radde it over, and gan the lettre folde.                         1085\r\n\r\n  156. And with his salte teres gan he bathe\r\n  The ruby in his signet, and it sette\r\n  Upon the wex deliverliche and rathe;\r\n  Ther-with a thousand tymes, er he lette,\r\n  He kiste tho the lettre that he shette,                              1090\r\n  And seyde, 'lettre, a blisful destenee\r\n  Thee shapen is, my lady shal thee see.'\r\n\r\n  157. This Pandare took the lettre, and that by tyme\r\n  A-morwe, and to his neces paleys sterte,\r\n  And faste he swoor, that it was passed pryme,                        1095\r\n  And gan to Iape, and seyde, 'y-wis, myn herte,\r\n  So fresh it is, al-though it sore smerte,\r\n  I may not slepe never a Mayes morwe;\r\n  I have a Ioly wo, a lusty sorwe.'\r\n\r\n  158. Criseyde, whan that she hir uncle herde,                        1100\r\n  With dreedful herte, and desirous to here\r\n  The cause of his cominge, thus answerde,\r\n  'Now by your feyth, myn uncle,' quod she, 'dere,\r\n  What maner windes gydeth yow now here?\r\n  Tel us your Ioly wo and your penaunce,                               1105\r\n  How ferforth be ye put in loves daunce.'\r\n\r\n  159. 'By god,' quod he, 'I hoppe alwey bihinde!'\r\n  And she to-laugh, it thoughte hir herte breste.\r\n  Quod Pandarus, 'loke alwey that ye finde\r\n  Game in myn hood, but herkneth, if yow leste;                        1110\r\n  Ther is right now come in-to toune a geste,\r\n  A Greek espye, and telleth newe thinges,\r\n  For which come I to telle yow tydinges.\r\n\r\n  160.

'Lo, he that is al hoolly youres free\r\n  Him recomaundeth lowly to your grace,\r\n  And sent to you this lettre here by me;\r\n  Avyseth you on it, whan ye han space,\r\n  And of som goodly answere yow purchace;                              1125\r\n  Or, helpe me god, so pleynly for to seyne,\r\n  He may not longe liven for his peyne.'\r\n\r\n  162. Ful dredfully tho gan she stonde stille,\r\n  And took it nought, but al hir humble chere\r\n  Gan for to chaunge, and seyde, 'scrit ne bille,                      1130\r\n  For love of god, that toucheth swich matere,\r\n  Ne bring me noon; and also, uncle dere,\r\n  To myn estat have more reward, I preye,\r\n  Than to his lust; what sholde I more seye?\r\n\r\n  163. And loketh now if this be resonable,                            1135\r\n  And letteth nought, for favour ne for slouthe,\r\n  To seyn a sooth; now were it covenable\r\n  To myn estat, by god, and by your trouthe,\r\n  To taken it, or to han of him routhe,\r\n  In harming of my-self or in repreve?                                 1140\r\n  Ber it a-yein, for him that ye on leve!'\r\n\r\n  164. This Pandarus gan on hir for to stare,\r\n  And seyde, 'now is this the grettest wonder\r\n  That ever I sey! lat be this nyce fare!\r\n  To deethe mote I smiten be with thonder,                             1145\r\n  If, for the citee which that stondeth yonder,\r\n  Wolde I a lettre un-to yow bringe or take\r\n  To harm of yow; what list yow thus it make?\r\n\r\n  165.

O flee not in, he seeth us, I suppose;\r\n  Lest he may thinke that ye him eschuwe.'                             1255\r\n  'Nay, nay,' quod she, and wex as reed as rose.\r\n  With that he gan hir humbly to saluwe,\r\n  With dreedful chere, and ofte his hewes muwe;\r\n  And up his look debonairly he caste,\r\n  And bekked on Pandare, and forth he paste.                           1260\r\n\r\n  181. God woot if he sat on his hors a-right,\r\n  Or goodly was beseyn, that ilke day!\r\n  God woot wher he was lyk a manly knight!\r\n  What sholde I drecche, or telle of his aray?\r\n  Criseyde, which that alle these thinges say,                         1265\r\n  To telle in short, hir lyked al y-fere,\r\n  His persone, his aray, his look, his chere,\r\n\r\n  182. His goodly manere and his gentillesse,\r\n  So wel, that never, sith that she was born,\r\n  Ne hadde she swich routhe of his distresse;                          1270\r\n  And how-so she hath hard ben her-biforn,\r\n  To god hope I, she hath now caught a thorn.\r\n  She shal not pulle it out this nexte wyke;\r\n  God sende mo swich thornes on to pyke!\r\n\r\n  183. Pandare, which that stood hir faste by,                         1275\r\n  Felte iren hoot, and he bigan to smyte,\r\n  And seyde, 'nece, I pray yow hertely,\r\n  Tel me that I shal axen yow a lyte.\r\n  A womman, that were of his deeth to wyte,\r\n  With-outen his gilt, but for hir lakked routhe,                      1280\r\n  Were it wel doon?' Quod she, 'nay, by my trouthe!'\r\n\r\n  184. 'God helpe me so,' quod he, 'ye sey me sooth.\r\n  Ye felen wel your-self that I not lye;\r\n  Lo, yond he rit!' Quod she, 'ye, so he dooth.'\r\n  'Wel,' quod Pandare, 'as I have told yow thrye,                      1285\r\n  Lat be your nyce shame and your folye,\r\n  And spek with him in esing of his herte;\r\n  Lat nycetee not do yow bothe smerte.'\r\n\r\n  185. But ther-on was to heven and to done;\r\n  Considered al thing, it may not be;                                  1290\r\n  And why, for shame; and it were eek to sone\r\n  To graunten him so greet a libertee.\r\n  'For playnly hir entente,' as seyde she,\r\n  Was for to love him unwist, if she mighte,\r\n  And guerdon him with no-thing but with sighte.'                      1295\r\n\r\n  186. But Pandarus thoughte, 'it shal not be so,\r\n  If that I may; this nyce opinioun\r\n  Shal not be holden fully yeres two.'\r\n  What sholde I make of this a long sermoun?\r\n  He moste assente on that conclusioun                                 1300\r\n  As for the tyme; and whan that it was eve,\r\n  And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.\r\n\r\n  187. And on his wey ful faste homward he spedde,\r\n  And right for Ioye he felte his herte daunce;\r\n  And Troilus he fond alone a-bedde,                                   1305\r\n  That lay as dooth these loveres, in a traunce,\r\n  Bitwixen hope and derk desesperaunce.\r\n  But Pandarus, right at his in-cominge,\r\n  He song, as who seyth, 'lo! sumwhat I bringe.'\r\n\r\n  188. And seyde, 'who is in his bed so sone                           1310\r\n  Y-buried thus?' 'It am I, freend,' quod he.\r\n  'Who, Troilus? nay helpe me so the mone,'\r\n  Quod Pandarus, 'thou shalt aryse and see\r\n  A charme that was sent right now to thee,\r\n  The which can helen thee of thyn accesse,                            1315\r\n  If thou do forth-with al thy besinesse.'\r\n\r\n  189. 'Ye, through the might of god!' quod Troilus.\r\n  And Pandarus gan him the lettre take,\r\n  And seyde, 'pardee, god hath holpen us;\r\n  Have here a light, and loke on al this blake.'                       1320\r\n  But ofte gan the herte glade and quake\r\n  Of Troilus, whyl that he gan it rede,\r\n  So as the wordes yave him hope or drede.\r\n\r\n  190. But fynally, he took al for the beste\r\n  That she him wroot, for sumwhat he biheld                            1325\r\n  On which, him thoughte, he mighte his herte reste,\r\n  Al covered she the wordes under sheld.\r\n  Thus to the more worthy part he held,\r\n  That, what for hope and Pandarus biheste,\r\n  His grete wo for-yede he at the leste.                               1330\r\n\r\n  191. But as we may alday our-selven see,\r\n  Through more wode or col, the more fyr;\r\n  Right so encrees of hope, of what it be,\r\n  Therwith ful ofte encreseth eek desyr;\r\n  Or, as an ook cometh of a litel spyr,                                1335\r\n  So through this lettre, which that she him sente,\r\n  Encresen gan desyr, of which he brente.\r\n\r\n  192. Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and night\r\n  This Troilus gan to desiren more\r\n  Than he dide erst, thurgh hope, and dide his might                   1340\r\n  To pressen on, as by Pandarus lore,\r\n  And wryten to hir of his sorwes sore\r\n  Fro day to day; he leet it not refreyde,\r\n  That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seyde;\r\n\r\n  193. And dide also his othere observaunces                           1345\r\n  That to a lovere longeth in this cas;\r\n  And, after that these dees turnede on chaunces,\r\n  So was he outher glad or seyde 'allas!'\r\n  And held after his gestes ay his pas;\r\n  And aftir swiche answeres as he hadde,                               1350\r\n  So were his dayes sory outher gladde.\r\n\r\n  194. But to Pandare alwey was his recours,\r\n  And pitously gan ay til him to pleyne,\r\n  And him bisoughte of rede and som socours;\r\n  And Pandarus, that sey his wode peyne,                               1355\r\n  Wex wel neigh deed for routhe, sooth to seyne,\r\n  And bisily with al his herte caste\r\n  Som of his wo to sleen, and that as faste;\r\n\r\n  195. And seyde, 'lord, and freend, and brother dere,\r\n  God woot that thy disese dooth me wo.                                1360\r\n  But woltow stinten al this woful chere,\r\n  And, by my trouthe, or it be dayes two,\r\n  And god to-forn, yet shal I shape it so,\r\n  That thou shalt come in-to a certayn place,\r\n  Ther-as thou mayst thy-self hir preye of grace.                      1365\r\n\r\n  196. And certainly, I noot if thou it wost,\r\n  But tho that been expert in love it seye,\r\n  It is oon of the thinges that furthereth most,\r\n  A man to have a leyser for to preye,\r\n  And siker place his wo for to biwreye;                               1370\r\n  For in good herte it moot som routhe impresse,\r\n  To here and see the giltles in distresse.\r\n\r\n  197.

Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certeyn,\r\n  And fedde hem wel with al that mighte lyke.                          1570\r\n  But ever-more, 'allas!' was his refreyn,\r\n  'My goode brother Troilus, the syke,\r\n  Lyth yet'--and therwith-al he gan to syke;\r\n  And after that, he peyned him to glade\r\n  Hem as he mighte, and chere good he made.                            1575\r\n\r\n  226. Compleyned eek Eleyne of his syknesse\r\n  So feithfully, that pitee was to here,\r\n  And every wight gan waxen for accesse\r\n  A leche anoon, and seyde, 'in this manere\r\n  Men curen folk; this charme I wol yow lere.'                         1580\r\n  But there sat oon, al list hir nought to teche,\r\n  That thoughte, best coude I yet been his leche.\r\n\r\n  227. After compleynt, him gonnen they to preyse,\r\n  As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne\r\n  To preyse a man, and up with prys him reyse                          1585\r\n  A thousand fold yet hyer than the sonne:--\r\n  'He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne.'\r\n  And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme,\r\n  He not for-gat hir preysing to conferme.\r\n\r\n  228. Herde al this thing Criseyde wel y-nough,                       1590\r\n  And every word gan for to notifye;\r\n  For which with sobre chere hir herte lough;\r\n  For who is that ne wolde hir glorifye,\r\n  To mowen swich a knight don live or dye?\r\n  But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle;                             1595\r\n  For for o fyn is al that ever I telle.\r\n\r\n  229. The tyme com, fro diner for to ryse,\r\n  And, as hem oughte, arisen everychoon,\r\n  And gonne a while of this and that devyse.\r\n  But Pandarus brak al this speche anoon,                              1600\r\n  And seyde to Deiphebus, 'wole ye goon,\r\n  If yourë wille be, as I yow preyde,\r\n  To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?'\r\n\r\n  230. Eleyne, which that by the hond hir held,\r\n  Took first the tale, and seyde, 'go we blyve;'                       1605\r\n  And goodly on Criseyde she biheld,\r\n  And seyde, 'Ioves lat him never thryve,\r\n  That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of lyve!\r\n  And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe,\r\n  If that I may, and alle folk be trewe.'                              1610\r\n\r\n  231. 'Tel thou thy neces cas,' quod Deiphebus\r\n  To Pandarus, 'for thou canst best it telle.'--\r\n  'My lordes and my ladyes, it stant thus;\r\n  What sholde I lenger,' quod he, 'do yow dwelle?'\r\n  He rong hem out a proces lyk a belle,                                1615\r\n  Up-on hir fo, that highte Poliphete,\r\n  So hëynous, that men mighte on it spete.\r\n\r\n  232. Answerde of this ech worse of hem than other,\r\n  And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien,\r\n  'An-honged be swich oon, were he my brother;                         1620\r\n  And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.'\r\n  What sholde I lenger in this tale tarien?\r\n  Pleynly, alle at ones, they hir highten,\r\n  To been hir helpe in al that ever they mighten.\r\n\r\n  233. Spak than Eleyne, and seyde, 'Pandarus,                         1625\r\n  Woot ought my lord, my brother, this matere,\r\n  I mene, Ector? or woot it Troilus?'\r\n  He seyde, 'ye, but wole ye now me here?\r\n  Me thinketh this, sith Troilus is here,\r\n  It were good, if that ye wolde assente,                              1630\r\n  She tolde hir-self him al this, er she wente.\r\n\r\n  234. For he wole have the more hir grief at herte,\r\n  By cause, lo, that she a lady is;\r\n  And, by your leve, I wol but right in sterte,\r\n  And do yow wite, and that anoon, y-wis,                              1635\r\n  If that he slepe, or wole ought here of this.'\r\n  And in he lepte, and seyde him in his ere,\r\n  'God have thy soule, y-brought have I thy bere!'\r\n\r\n  235. To smylen of this gan tho Troilus,\r\n  And Pandarus, with-oute rekeninge,                                   1640\r\n  Out wente anoon to Eleyne and Deiphebus,\r\n  And seyde hem, 'so there be no taryinge,\r\n  Ne more pres, he wol wel that ye bringe\r\n  Crisëyda, my lady, that is here;\r\n  And as he may enduren, he wole here.                                 1645\r\n\r\n  236. But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lyte,\r\n  And fewe folk may lightly make it warm;\r\n  Now loketh ye, (for I wol have no wyte,\r\n  To bringe in prees that mighte doon him harm\r\n  Or him disesen, for my bettre arm),                                  1650\r\n  Wher it be bet she byde til eft-sones;\r\n  Now loketh ye, that knowen what to doon is.\r\n\r\n  237. I sey for me, best is, as I can knowe,\r\n  That no wight in ne wente but ye tweye,\r\n  But it were I, for I can, in a throwe,                               1655\r\n  Reherce hir cas, unlyk that she can seye;\r\n  And after this, she may him ones preye\r\n  To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve;\r\n  This may not muchel of his ese him reve.\r\n\r\n  238. And eek, for she is straunge, he wol forbere                    1660\r\n  His ese, which that him thar nought for yow;\r\n  Eek other thing, that toucheth not to here,\r\n  He wol me telle, I woot it wel right now,\r\n  That secret is, and for the tounes prow.'\r\n  And they, that no-thing knewe of this entente,                       1665\r\n  With-oute more, to Troilus in they wente.\r\n\r\n  239. Eleyne in al hir goodly softe wyse,\r\n  Gan him saluwe, and womanly to pleye,\r\n  And seyde, 'ywis, ye moste alweyes aryse!\r\n  Now fayre brother, beth al hool, I preye!'                           1670\r\n  And gan hir arm right over his sholder leye,\r\n  And him with al hir wit to recomforte;\r\n  As she best coude, she gan him to disporte.\r\n\r\n  240. So after this quod she, 'we yow biseke,\r\n  My dere brother, Deiphebus, and I,                                   1675\r\n  For love of god, and so doth Pandare eke,\r\n  To been good lord and freend, right hertely,\r\n  Un-to Criseyde, which that certeinly\r\n  Receyveth wrong, as woot wel here Pandare,\r\n  That can hir cas wel bet than I declare.'                            1680\r\n\r\n  241. This Pandarus gan newe his tunge affyle,\r\n  And al hir cas reherce, and that anoon;\r\n  Whan it was seyd, sone after, in a whyle,\r\n  Quod Troilus, 'as sone as I may goon,\r\n  I wol right fayn with al my might ben oon,                           1685\r\n  Have god my trouthe, hir cause to sustene.'\r\n  'Good thrift have ye,' quod Eleyne the quene.\r\n\r\n  242. Quod Pandarus, 'and it your wille be,\r\n  That she may take hir leve, er that she go?'\r\n  'Or elles god for-bede,' tho quod he,                                1690\r\n  'If that she vouche sauf for to do so.'\r\n  And with that word quod Troilus, 'ye two,\r\n  Deiphebus, and my suster leef and dere,\r\n  To yow have I to speke of o matere,\r\n\r\n  243. To been avysed by your reed the bettre':--                      1695\r\n  And fond, as hap was, at his beddes heed,\r\n  The copie of a tretis and a lettre,\r\n  That Ector hadde him sent to axen reed,\r\n  If swich a man was worthy to ben deed,\r\n  Woot I nought who; but in a grisly wyse                              1700\r\n  He preyede hem anoon on it avyse.\r\n\r\n  244. Deiphebus gan this lettre to unfolde\r\n  In ernest greet; so dide Eleyne the quene;\r\n  And rominge outward, fast it gan biholde,\r\n  Downward a steyre, in-to an herber grene.                            1705\r\n  This ilke thing they redden hem bi-twene;\r\n  And largely, the mountaunce of an houre,\r\n  They gonne on it to reden and to poure.\r\n\r\n  245. Now lat hem rede, and turne we anoon\r\n  To Pandarus, that gan ful faste prye                                 1710\r\n  That al was wel, and out he gan to goon\r\n  In-to the grete chambre, and that in hye,\r\n  And seyde, 'god save al this companye!\r\n  Com, nece myn; my lady quene Eleyne\r\n  Abydeth yow, and eek my lordes tweyne.                               1715\r\n\r\n  246. Rys, take with yow your nece Antigone,\r\n  Or whom yow list, or no fors, hardily;\r\n  The lasse prees, the bet; com forth with me,\r\n  And loke that ye thonke humblely\r\n  Hem alle three, and, whan ye may goodly                              1720\r\n  Your tyme y-see, taketh of hem your leve,\r\n  Lest we to longe his restes him bireve.'\r\n\r\n  247. Al innocent of Pandarus entente,\r\n  Quod tho Criseyde, 'go we, uncle dere';\r\n  And arm in arm inward with him she wente,                            1725\r\n  Avysed wel hir wordes and hir chere;\r\n  And Pandarus, in ernestful manere,\r\n  Seyde, 'alle folk, for goddes love, I preye,\r\n  Stinteth right here, and softely yow pleye.\r\n\r\n  248. Aviseth yow what folk ben here with-inne,                       1730\r\n  And in what plyt oon is, god him amende!\r\n  And inward thus ful softely biginne;\r\n  Nece, I coniure and heighly yow defende,\r\n  On his half, which that sowle us alle sende,\r\n  And in the vertue of corounes tweyne,                                1735\r\n  Slee nought this man, that hath for yow this peyne!\r\n\r\n  249.

O tonge, allas! so often here-biforn\r\n  Hastow made many a lady bright of hewe\r\n  Seyd, \"welawey! the day that I was born!\"\r\n  And many a maydes sorwes for to newe;                                 305\r\n  And, for the more part, al is untrewe\r\n  That men of yelpe, and it were brought to preve;\r\n  Of kinde non avauntour is to leve.\r\n\r\n  45. Avauntour and a lyere, al is on;\r\n  As thus: I pose, a womman graunte me                                  310\r\n  Hir love, and seyth that other wol she non,\r\n  And I am sworn to holden it secree,\r\n  And after I go telle it two or three;\r\n  Y-wis, I am avauntour at the leste,\r\n  And lyere, for I breke my biheste.                                    315\r\n\r\n  46. Now loke thanne, if they be nought to blame,\r\n  Swich maner folk; what shal I clepe hem, what,\r\n  That hem avaunte of wommen, and by name,\r\n  That never yet bihighte hem this ne that,\r\n  Ne knewe hem more than myn olde hat?                                  320\r\n  No wonder is, so god me sende hele,\r\n  Though wommen drede with us men to dele.\r\n\r\n  47. I sey not this for no mistrust of yow,\r\n  Ne for no wys man, but for foles nyce,\r\n  And for the harm that in the world is now,                            325\r\n  As wel for foly ofte as for malyce;\r\n  For wel wot I, in wyse folk, that vyce\r\n  No womman drat, if she be wel avysed;\r\n  For wyse ben by foles harm chastysed.\r\n\r\n  48. But now to purpos; leve brother dere,                             330\r\n  Have al this thing that I have seyd in minde,\r\n  And keep thee clos, and be now of good chere,\r\n  For at thy day thou shalt me trewe finde.\r\n  I shal thy proces sette in swich a kinde,\r\n  And god to-forn, that it shall thee suffyse,                          335\r\n  For it shal been right as thou wolt devyse.\r\n\r\n  49. For wel I woot, thou menest wel, parde;\r\n  Therfore I dar this fully undertake.\r\n  Thou wost eek what thy lady graunted thee,\r\n  And day is set, the chartres up to make.                              340\r\n  Have now good night, I may no lenger wake;\r\n  And bid for me, sin thou art now in blisse,\r\n  That god me sende deeth or sone lisse.'\r\n\r\n  50. Who mighte telle half the Ioye or feste\r\n  Which that the sowle of Troilus tho felte,                            345\r\n  Heringe theffect of Pandarus biheste?\r\n  His olde wo, that made his herte swelte,\r\n  Gan tho for Ioye wasten and to-melte,\r\n  And al the richesse of his sykes sore\r\n  At ones fledde, he felte of hem no more.                              350\r\n\r\n  51. But right so as these holtes and these hayes,\r\n  That han in winter dede been and dreye,\r\n  Revesten hem in grene, whan that May is,\r\n  Whan every lusty lyketh best to pleye:\r\n  Right in that selve wyse, sooth to seye,                              355\r\n  Wex sodeynliche his herte ful of Ioye,\r\n  That gladder was ther never man in Troye.\r\n\r\n  52. And gan his look on Pandarus up caste\r\n  Ful sobrely, and frendly for to see,\r\n  And seyde, 'freend, in Aprille the laste,                             360\r\n  As wel thou wost, if it remembre thee,\r\n  How neigh the deeth for wo thou founde me;\r\n  And how thou didest al thy bisinesse\r\n  To knowe of me the cause of my distresse.\r\n\r\n  53. Thou wost how longe I it for-bar to seye                          365\r\n  To thee, that art the man that I best triste;\r\n  And peril was it noon to thee by-wreye,\r\n  That wiste I wel; but tel me, if thee liste,\r\n  Sith I so looth was that thy-self it wiste,\r\n  How dorste I mo tellen of this matere,                                370\r\n  That quake now, and no wight may us here?\r\n\r\n  54. But natheles, by that god I thee swere,\r\n  That, as him list, may al this world governe,\r\n  And, if I lye, Achilles with his spere\r\n  Myn herte cleve, al were my lyf eterne,                               375\r\n  As I am mortal, if I late or yerne\r\n  Wolde it biwreye, or dorste, or sholde conne,\r\n  For al the good that god made under sonne;\r\n\r\n  55. That rather deye I wolde, and determyne,\r\n  As thinketh me, now stokked in presoun,                               380\r\n  In wrecchednesse, in filthe, and in vermyne,\r\n  Caytif to cruel king Agamenoun;\r\n  And this, in alle the temples of this toun,\r\n  Upon the goddes alle, I wol thee swere,\r\n  To-morwe day, if that thee lyketh here.                               385\r\n\r\n  56. And that thou hast so muche y-doon for me,\r\n  That I ne may it never-more deserve,\r\n  This knowe I wel, al mighte I now for thee\r\n  A thousand tymes on a morwen sterve,\r\n  I can no more, but that I wol thee serve                              390\r\n  Right as thy sclave, whider-so thou wende,\r\n  For ever-more, un-to my lyves ende!\r\n\r\n  57. But here, with al myn herte, I thee biseche,\r\n  That never in me thou deme swich folye\r\n  As I shal seyn; me thoughte, by thy speche,                           395\r\n  That this, which thou me dost for companye,\r\n  I sholde wene it were a bauderye;\r\n  I am nought wood, al-if I lewed be;\r\n  It is not so, that wool I wel, pardee.\r\n\r\n  58. But he that goth, for gold or for richesse,                       400\r\n  On swich message, calle him what thee list;\r\n  And this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse,\r\n  Compassioun, and felawship, and trist;\r\n  Departe it so, for wyde-where is wist\r\n  How that there is dyversitee requered                                 405\r\n  Bitwixen thinges lyke, as I have lered.\r\n\r\n  59. And, that thou knowe I thenke nought ne wene\r\n  That this servyse a shame be or Iape,\r\n  I have my faire suster Polixene,\r\n  Cassandre, Eleyne, or any of the frape;                               410\r\n  Be she never so faire or wel y-shape,\r\n  Tel me, which thou wilt of everichone,\r\n  To han for thyn, and lat me thanne allone.\r\n\r\n  60. But sin that thou hast don me this servyse,\r\n  My lyf to save, and for noon hope of mede,                            415\r\n  So, for the love of god, this grete empryse\r\n  Parforme it out; for now is moste nede.\r\n  For high and low, with-outen any drede,\r\n  I wol alwey thyne hestes alle kepe;\r\n  Have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.'                         420\r\n\r\n  61. Thus held him ech with other wel apayed,\r\n  That al the world ne mighte it bet amende;\r\n  And, on the morwe, whan they were arayed,\r\n  Ech to his owene nedes gan entende.\r\n  But Troilus, though as the fyr he brende                              425\r\n  For sharp desyr of hope and of plesaunce,\r\n  He not for-gat his gode governaunce.\r\n\r\n  62. But in him-self with manhod gan restreyne\r\n  Ech rakel dede and ech unbrydled chere,\r\n  That alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne,                             430\r\n  Ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere,\r\n  What that he mente, as touching this matere.\r\n  From every wight as fer as is the cloude\r\n  He was, so wel dissimulen he coude.\r\n\r\n  63. And al the whyl which that I yow devyse,                          435\r\n  This was his lyf; with al his fulle might,\r\n  By day he was in Martes high servyse,\r\n  This is to seyn, in armes as a knight;\r\n  And for the more part, the longe night\r\n  He lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve                         440\r\n  His lady best, hir thank for to deserve.\r\n\r\n  64. Nil I nought swerë, al-though he lay softe,\r\n  That in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed,\r\n  Ne that he tornede on his pilwes ofte,\r\n  And wolde of that him missed han ben sesed;                           445\r\n  But in swich cas man is nought alwey plesed,\r\n  For ought I wot, no more than was he;\r\n  That can I deme of possibilitee.\r\n\r\n  65. But certeyn is, to purpos for to go,\r\n  That in this whyle, as writen is in geste,                            450\r\n  He say his lady som-tyme; and also\r\n  She with him spak, whan that she dorste or leste,\r\n  And by hir bothe avys, as was the beste,\r\n  Apoynteden ful warly in this nede,\r\n  So as they dorste, how they wolde procede.                            455\r\n\r\n  66. But it was spoken in so short a wyse,\r\n  In swich awayt alwey, and in swich fere,\r\n  Lest any wyght divynen or devyse\r\n  Wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere,\r\n  That al this world so leef to hem ne were                             460\r\n  As that Cupido wolde hem grace sende\r\n  To maken of hir speche aright an ende.\r\n\r\n  67. But thilke litel that they speke or wroughte,\r\n  His wyse goost took ay of al swich hede,\r\n  It semed hir, he wiste what she thoughte                              465\r\n  With-outen word, so that it was no nede\r\n  To bidde him ought to done, or ought for-bede;\r\n  For which she thoughte that love, al come it late,\r\n  Of alle Ioye hadde opned hir the yate.\r\n\r\n  68. And shortly of this proces for to pace,                           470\r\n  So wel his werk and wordes he bisette,\r\n  That he so ful stood in his lady grace,\r\n  That twenty thousand tymes, or she lette,\r\n  She thonked god she ever with him mette;\r\n  So coude he him governe in swich servyse,                             475\r\n  That al the world ne mighte it bet devyse.\r\n\r\n  69. For-why she fond him so discreet in al,\r\n  So secret, and of swich obëisaunce,\r\n  That wel she felte he was to hir a wal\r\n  Of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce;                          480\r\n  That, to ben in his gode governaunce,\r\n  So wys he was, she was no more afered,\r\n  I mene, as fer as oughte ben requered.\r\n\r\n  70. And Pandarus, to quike alwey the fyr,\r\n  Was ever y-lyke prest and diligent;                                   485\r\n  To ese his frend was set al his desyr.\r\n  He shof ay on, he to and fro was sent;\r\n  He lettres bar whan Troilus was absent.\r\n  That never man, as in his freendes nede,\r\n  Ne bar him bet than he, with-outen drede.                             490\r\n\r\n  71. But now, paraunter, som man wayten wolde\r\n  That every word, or sonde, or look, or chere\r\n  Of Troilus that I rehersen sholde,\r\n  In al this whyle, un-to his lady dere;\r\n  I trowe it were a long thing for to here;                             495\r\n  Or of what wight that stant in swich disioynte,\r\n  His wordes alle, or every look, to poynte.\r\n\r\n  72. For sothe, I have not herd it doon er this,\r\n  In storye noon, ne no man here, I wene;\r\n  And though I wolde I coude not, y-wis;                                500\r\n  For ther was som epistel hem bitwene,\r\n  That wolde, as seyth myn auctor, wel contene\r\n  Neigh half this book, of which him list not wryte;\r\n  How sholde I thanne a lyne of it endyte?\r\n\r\n  73. But to the grete effect: than sey I thus,                         505\r\n  That stonding in concord and in quiete\r\n  Thise ilke two, Criseyde and Troilus,\r\n  As I have told, and in this tyme swete,\r\n  Save only often mighte they not mete,\r\n  Ne layser have hir speches to fulfelle,                               510\r\n  That it befel right as I shal yow telle,\r\n\r\n  74. That Pandarus, that ever dide his might\r\n  Right for the fyn that I shal speke of here,\r\n  As for to bringe to his hous som night\r\n  His faire nece, and Troilus y-fere,                                   515\r\n  Wher-as at leyser al this heigh matere,\r\n  Touching hir love, were at the fulle up-bounde,\r\n  Hadde out of doute a tyme to it founde.\r\n\r\n  75. For he with greet deliberacioun\r\n  Hadde every thing that her-to mighte avayle                           520\r\n  Forn-cast, and put in execucioun,\r\n  And neither laft, for cost ne for travayle;\r\n  Come if hem lest, hem sholde no-thing fayle;\r\n  And for to been in ought espyed there,\r\n  That, wiste he wel, an inpossible were.                               525\r\n\r\n  76. Dredelees, it cleer was in the wind\r\n  Of every pye and every lette-game;\r\n  Now al is wel, for al the world is blind\r\n  In this matere, bothe fremed and tame.\r\n  This timber is al redy up to frame;                                   530\r\n  Us lakketh nought but that we witen wolde\r\n  A certein houre, in whiche she comen sholde.\r\n\r\n  77. And Troilus, that al this purveyaunce\r\n  Knew at the fulle, and waytede on it ay,\r\n  Hadde here-up-on eek made gret ordenaunce,                            535\r\n  And founde his cause, and ther-to his aray,\r\n  If that he were missed, night or day,\r\n  Ther-whyle he was aboute this servyse,\r\n  That he was goon to doon his sacrifyse,\r\n\r\n  78. And moste at swich a temple alone wake,                           540\r\n  Answered of Appollo for to be;\r\n  And first, to seen the holy laurer quake,\r\n  Er that Apollo spak out of the tree,\r\n  To telle him next whan Grekes sholden flee,\r\n  And forthy lette him no man, god forbede,                             545\r\n  But preye Apollo helpen in this nede.\r\n\r\n  79. Now is ther litel more for to done,\r\n  But Pandare up, and shortly for to seyne,\r\n  Right sone upon the chaunging of the mone,\r\n  Whan lightles is the world a night or tweyne,                         550\r\n  And that the welken shoop him for to reyne,\r\n  He streight a-morwe un-to his nece wente;\r\n  Ye han wel herd the fyn of his entente.\r\n\r\n  80. Whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye\r\n  As he was wont, and of him-self to Iape;                              555\r\n  And fynally, he swor and gan hir seye,\r\n  By this and that, she sholde him not escape,\r\n  Ne lengere doon him after hir to gape;\r\n  But certeynly she moste, by hir leve,\r\n  Come soupen in his hous with him at eve.                              560\r\n\r\n  81. At whiche she lough, and gan hir faste excuse,\r\n  And seyde, 'it rayneth; lo, how sholde I goon?'\r\n  'Lat be,' quod he, 'ne stond not thus to muse;\r\n  This moot be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.'\r\n  So at the laste her-of they felle at oon,                             565\r\n  Or elles, softe he swor hir in hir ere,\r\n  He nolde never come ther she were.\r\n\r\n  82. Sone after this, to him she gan to rowne,\r\n  And asked him if Troilus were there?\r\n  He swor hir, 'nay, for he was out of towne,'                          570\r\n  And seyde, 'nece, I pose that he were,\r\n  Yow thurfte never have the more fere.\r\n  For rather than men mighte him ther aspye,\r\n  Me were lever a thousand-fold to dye.'\r\n\r\n  83. Nought list myn auctor fully to declare                           575\r\n  What that she thoughte whan he seyde so,\r\n  That Troilus was out of town y-fare,\r\n  As if he seyde ther-of sooth or no;\r\n  But that, with-oute awayt, with him to go,\r\n  She graunted him, sith he hir that bisoughte,                         580\r\n  And, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte.\r\n\r\n  84. But nathelees, yet gan she him biseche,\r\n  Al-though with him to goon it was no fere,\r\n  For to be war of goosish peples speche,\r\n  That dremen thinges whiche that never were,                           585\r\n  And wel avyse him whom he broughte there;\r\n  And seyde him, 'eem, sin I mot on yow triste,\r\n  Loke al be wel, and do now as yow liste.'\r\n\r\n  85. He swor hir, 'yis, by stokkes and by stones,\r\n  And by the goddes that in hevene dwelle,                              590\r\n  Or elles were him lever, soule and bones,\r\n  With Pluto king as depe been in helle\r\n  As Tantalus!' What sholde I more telle?\r\n  Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve,\r\n  And she to souper com, whan it was eve,                               595\r\n\r\n  86. With a certayn of hir owene men,\r\n  And with hir faire nece Antigone,\r\n  And othere of hir wommen nyne or ten;\r\n  But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye,\r\n  But Troilus, that stood and mighte it see                             600\r\n  Thurgh-out a litel windowe in a stewe,\r\n  Ther he bishet, sin midnight, was in mewe,\r\n\r\n  87. Unwist of every wight but of Pandare?\r\n  But to the poynt; now whan she was y-come\r\n  With alle Ioye, and alle frendes fare,                                605\r\n  Hir eem anoon in armes hath hir nome,\r\n  And after to the souper, alle and some,\r\n  Whan tyme was, ful softe they hem sette;\r\n  God wot, ther was no deyntee for to fette.\r\n\r\n  88. And after souper gonnen they to ryse,                             610\r\n  At ese wel, with hertes fresshe and glade,\r\n  And wel was him that coude best devyse\r\n  To lyken hir, or that hir laughen made.\r\n  He song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of Wade.\r\n  But at the laste, as every thing hath ende,                           615\r\n  She took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende.\r\n\r\n  89. But O, Fortune, executrice of wierdes,\r\n  O influences of thise hevenes hye!\r\n  Soth is, that, under god, ye ben our hierdes,\r\n  Though to us bestes been the causes wrye.                             620\r\n  This mene I now, for she gan hoomward hye,\r\n  But execut was al bisyde hir leve,\r\n  At the goddes wil; for which she moste bleve.\r\n\r\n  90. The bente mone with hir hornes pale,\r\n  Saturne, and Iove, in Cancro ioyned were,                             625\r\n  That swich a rayn from hevene gan avale,\r\n  That every maner womman that was there\r\n  Hadde of that smoky reyn a verray fere;\r\n  At which Pandare tho lough, and seyde thenne,\r\n  'Now were it tyme a lady to go henne!                                 630\r\n\r\n  91. But goode nece, if I mighte ever plese\r\n  Yow any-thing, than prey I yow,' quod he,\r\n  'To doon myn herte as now so greet an ese\r\n  As for to dwelle here al this night with me,\r\n  For-why this is your owene hous, pardee.                              635\r\n  For, by my trouthe, I sey it nought a-game,\r\n  To wende as now, it were to me a shame.'\r\n\r\n  92. Criseyde, whiche that coude as muche good\r\n  As half a world, tok hede of his preyere;\r\n  And sin it ron, and al was on a flood,                                640\r\n  She thoughte, as good chep may I dwellen here,\r\n  And graunte it gladly with a freendes chere,\r\n  And have a thank, as grucche and thanne abyde;\r\n  For hoom to goon it may nought wel bityde.\r\n\r\n  93.

Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright\r\n  The newe Ioye, and al the feste agayn;\r\n  But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he might,\r\n  He wolde han hyed hir to bedde fayn,                                  655\r\n  And seyde, 'lord, this is an huge rayn!\r\n  This were a weder for to slepen inne;\r\n  And that I rede us sone to biginne.\r\n\r\n  95. And nece, woot ye wher I wol yow leye,\r\n  For that we shul not liggen fer asonder,                              660\r\n  And for ye neither shullen, dar I seye,\r\n  Heren noise of reynes nor of thondre?\r\n  By god, right in my lyte closet yonder.\r\n  And I wol in that outer hous allone\r\n  Be wardeyn of your wommen everichone.                                 665\r\n\r\n  96.

'Thanne, eem,' quod she, 'doth her-of as yow list;\r\n  But er he come I wil up first aryse;                                  940\r\n  And, for the love of god, sin al my trist\r\n  Is on yow two, and ye ben bothe wyse,\r\n  So wircheth now in so discreet a wyse,\r\n  That I honour may have, and he plesaunce;\r\n  For I am here al in your governaunce.'                                945\r\n\r\n  136. 'That is wel seyd,' quod he, 'my nece dere,\r\n  Ther good thrift on that wyse gentil herte!\r\n  But liggeth stille, and taketh him right here,\r\n  It nedeth not no ferther for him sterte;\r\n  And ech of yow ese otheres sorwes smerte,                             950\r\n  For love of god; and, Venus, I thee herie;\r\n  For sone hope I we shulle ben alle merie.'\r\n\r\n  137. This Troilus ful sone on knees him sette\r\n  Ful sobrely, right by hir beddes heed,\r\n  And in his beste wyse his lady grette;                                955\r\n  But lord, so she wex sodeynliche reed!\r\n  Ne, though men sholden smyten of hir heed,\r\n  She coude nought a word a-right out-bringe\r\n  So sodeynly, for his sodeyn cominge.\r\n\r\n  138. But Pandarus, that so wel coude fele                             960\r\n  In every thing, to pleye anoon bigan,\r\n  And seyde, 'nece, see how this lord can knele!\r\n  Now, for your trouthe, seeth this gentil man!'\r\n  And with that word he for a quisshen ran,\r\n  And seyde, 'kneleth now, whyl that yow leste,                         965\r\n  Ther god your hertes bringe sone at reste!'\r\n\r\n  139. Can I not seyn, for she bad him not ryse,\r\n  If sorwe it putte out of hir remembraunce,\r\n  Or elles if she toke it in the wyse\r\n  Of duëtee, as for his observaunce;                                    970\r\n  But wel finde I she dide him this plesaunce,\r\n  That she him kiste, al-though she syked sore;\r\n  And bad him sitte a-doun with-outen more.\r\n\r\n  140. Quod Pandarus, 'now wol ye wel biginne;\r\n  Now doth him sitte, gode nece dere,                                   975\r\n  Upon your beddes syde al there with-inne,\r\n  That ech of yow the bet may other here.'\r\n  And with that word he drow him to the fere,\r\n  And took a light, and fond his contenaunce\r\n  As for to loke up-on an old romaunce.                                 980\r\n\r\n  141. Criseyde, that was Troilus lady right,\r\n  And cleer stood on a ground of sikernesse,\r\n  Al thoughte she, hir servaunt and hir knight\r\n  Ne sholde of right non untrouthe in hir gesse,\r\n  Yet nathelees, considered his distresse,                              985\r\n  And that love is in cause of swich folye,\r\n  Thus to him spak she of his Ielousye:\r\n\r\n  142. 'Lo, herte myn, as wolde the excellence\r\n  Of love, ayeins the which that no man may,\r\n  Ne oughte eek goodly maken resistence                                 990\r\n  And eek bycause I felte wel and say\r\n  Your grete trouthe, and servyse every day;\r\n  And that your herte al myn was, sooth to seyne,\r\n  This droof me for to rewe up-on your peyne.\r\n\r\n  143. And your goodnesse have I founde alwey yit,                      995\r\n  Of whiche, my dere herte and al my knight,\r\n  I thonke it yow, as fer as I have wit,\r\n  Al can I nought as muche as it were right;\r\n  And I, emforth my conninge and my might,\r\n  Have and ay shal, how sore that me smerte,                           1000\r\n  Ben to yow trewe and hool, with al myn herte;\r\n\r\n  144. And dredelees, that shal be founde at preve.---\r\n  But, herte myn, what al this is to seyne\r\n  Shal wel be told, so that ye noght yow greve,\r\n  Though I to yow right on your-self compleyne.                        1005\r\n  For ther-with mene I fynally the peyne,\r\n  That halt your herte and myn in hevinesse,\r\n  Fully to sleen, and every wrong redresse.\r\n\r\n  145. My goode, myn, not I for-why ne how\r\n  That Ialousye, allas! that wikked wivere,                            1010\r\n  Thus causelees is cropen in-to yow;\r\n  The harm of which I wolde fayn delivere!\r\n  Allas! that he, al hool, or of him slivere,\r\n  Shuld have his refut in so digne a place,\r\n  Ther Iove him sone out of your herte arace!                          1015\r\n\r\n  146. But O, thou Iove, O auctor of nature,\r\n  Is this an honour to thy deitee,\r\n  That folk ungiltif suffren here iniure,\r\n  And who that giltif is, al quit goth he?\r\n  O were it leful for to pleyne on thee,                               1020\r\n  That undeserved suffrest Ialousye,\r\n  And that I wolde up-on thee pleyne and crye!\r\n\r\n  147. Eek al my wo is this, that folk now usen\r\n  To seyn right thus, \"ye, Ialousye is love!\"\r\n  And wolde a busshel venim al excusen,                                1025\r\n  For that o greyn of love is on it shove!\r\n  But that wot heighe god that sit above,\r\n  If it be lyker love, or hate, or grame;\r\n  And after that, it oughte bere his name.\r\n\r\n  148. But certeyn is, som maner Ialousye                              1030\r\n  Is excusable more than som, y-wis.\r\n  As whan cause is, and som swich fantasye\r\n  With pietee so wel repressed is,\r\n  That it unnethe dooth or seyth amis,\r\n  But goodly drinketh up al his distresse;                             1035\r\n  And that excuse I, for the gentilesse.\r\n\r\n  149. And som so ful of furie is and despyt,\r\n  That it sourmounteth his repressioun;\r\n  But herte myn, ye be not in that plyt,\r\n  That thanke I god, for whiche your passioun                          1040\r\n  I wol not calle it but illusioun,\r\n  Of habundaunce of love and bisy cure,\r\n  That dooth your herte this disese endure.\r\n\r\n  150. Of which I am right sory, but not wrooth;\r\n  But, for my devoir and your hertes reste,                            1045\r\n  Wher-so yow list, by ordal or by ooth,\r\n  By sort, or in what wyse so yow leste,\r\n  For love of god, lat preve it for the beste!\r\n  And if that I be giltif, do me deye,\r\n  Allas! what mighte I more doon or seye?'                             1050\r\n\r\n  151. With that a fewe brighte teres newe\r\n  Out of hir eyen fille, and thus she seyde,\r\n  'Now god, thou wost, in thought ne dede untrewe\r\n  To Troilus was never yet Criseyde.'\r\n  With that hir heed doun in the bed she leyde,                        1055\r\n  And with the shete it wreigh, and syghed sore,\r\n  And held hir pees; not o word spak she more.\r\n\r\n  152. But now help god to quenchen al this sorwe,\r\n  So hope I that he shal, for he best may;\r\n  For I have seyn, of a ful misty morwe                                1060\r\n  Folwen ful ofte a mery someres day;\r\n  And after winter folweth grene May.\r\n  Men seen alday, and reden eek in stories,\r\n  That after sharpe shoures been victories.\r\n\r\n  153. This Troilus, whan he hir wordes herde,                         1065\r\n  Have ye no care, him liste not to slepe;\r\n  For it thoughte him no strokes of a yerde\r\n  To here or seen Criseyde his lady wepe;\r\n  But wel he felte aboute his herte crepe,\r\n  For every teer which that Criseyde asterte,                          1070\r\n  The crampe of deeth, to streyne him by the herte.\r\n\r\n  154. And in his minde he gan the tyme acurse\r\n  That he cam therë, and that he was born;\r\n  For now is wikke y-turned in-to worse,\r\n  And al that labour he hath doon biforn,                              1075\r\n  He wende it lost, he thoughte he nas but lorn.\r\n  'O Pandarus,' thoughte he, 'allas! thy wyle\r\n  Serveth of nought, so weylawey the whyle!'\r\n\r\n  155. And therwithal he heng a-doun the heed,\r\n  And fil on knees, and sorwfully he sighte;                           1080\r\n  What mighte he seyn? he felte he nas but deed,\r\n  For wrooth was she that shulde his sorwes lighte.\r\n  But nathelees, whan that he speken mighte,\r\n  Than seyde he thus, 'god woot, that of this game,\r\n  Whan al is wist, than am I not to blame!'                            1085\r\n\r\n  156. Ther-with the sorwe so his herte shette,\r\n  That from his eyen fil ther not a tere,\r\n  And every spirit his vigour in-knette,\r\n  So they astoned and oppressed were.\r\n  The feling of his sorwe, or of his fere,                             1090\r\n  Or of ought elles, fled was out of towne;\r\n  And doun he fel al sodeynly a-swowne.\r\n\r\n  157. This was no litel sorwe for to see;\r\n  But al was hust, and Pandare up as faste,\r\n  'O nece, pees, or we be lost,' quod he,                              1095\r\n  Beth nought agast;' but certeyn, at the laste,\r\n  For this or that, he in-to bedde him caste,\r\n  And seyde, 'O theef, is this a mannes herte?'\r\n  And of he rente al to his bare sherte;\r\n\r\n  158. And seyde, 'nece, but ye helpe us now,                          1100\r\n  Allas, your owne Troilus is lorn!'\r\n  'Y-wis, so wolde I, and I wiste how,\r\n  Ful fayn,' quod she; 'allas! that I was born!'\r\n  'Ye, nece, wol ye pullen out the thorn\r\n  That stiketh in his herte?' quod Pandare;                            1105\r\n  'Sey \"al foryeve,\" and stint is al this fare!'\r\n\r\n  159. 'Ye, that to me,' quod she, 'ful lever were\r\n  Than al the good the sonne aboute gooth';\r\n  And therwith-al she swoor him in his ere,\r\n  'Y-wis, my dere herte, I am nought wrooth,                           1110\r\n  Have here my trouthe and many another ooth;\r\n  Now speek to me, for it am I, Cryseyde!'\r\n  But al for nought; yet mighte he not a-breyde.\r\n\r\n  160. Therwith his pous and pawmes of his hondes\r\n  They gan to frote, and wete his temples tweyne,                      1115\r\n  And, to deliveren him from bittre bondes,\r\n  She ofte him kiste; and, shortly for to seyne,\r\n  Him to revoken she dide al hir peyne.\r\n  And at the laste, he gan his breeth to drawe,\r\n  And of his swough sone after that adawe,                             1120\r\n\r\n  161. And gan bet minde and reson to him take,\r\n  But wonder sore he was abayst, y-wis.\r\n  And with a syk, whan he gan bet a-wake,\r\n  He seyde, 'O mercy, god, what thing is this?'\r\n  'Why do ye with your-selven thus amis?'                              1125\r\n  Quod tho Criseyde, 'is this a mannes game?\r\n  What, Troilus! wol ye do thus, for shame?'\r\n\r\n  162. And therwith-al hir arm over him she leyde,\r\n  And al foryaf, and ofte tyme him keste.\r\n  He thonked hir, and to hir spak, and seyde                           1130\r\n  As fil to purpos for his herte reste.\r\n  And she to that answerde him as hir leste;\r\n  And with hir goodly wordes him disporte\r\n  She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte.\r\n\r\n  163. Quod Pandarus, 'for ought I can espyen,                         1135\r\n  This light nor I ne serven here of nought;\r\n  Light is not good for syke folkes yën.\r\n  But for the love of god, sin ye be brought\r\n  In thus good plyt, lat now non hevy thought\r\n  Ben hanginge in the hertes of yow tweye:'                            1140\r\n  And bar the candele to the chimeneye.\r\n\r\n  164. Sone after this, though it no nede were,\r\n  Whan she swich othes as hir list devyse\r\n  Hadde of him take, hir thoughte tho no fere,\r\n  Ne cause eek non, to bidde him thennes ryse.                         1145\r\n  Yet lesse thing than othes may suffyse\r\n  In many a cas; for every wight, I gesse,\r\n  That loveth wel meneth but gentilesse.\r\n\r\n  165. But in effect she wolde wite anoon\r\n  Of what man, and eek where, and also why                             1150\r\n  He Ielous was, sin ther was cause noon;\r\n  And eek the signe, that he took it by,\r\n  She bad him that to telle hir bisily,\r\n  Or elles, certeyn, she bar him on honde,\r\n  That this was doon of malis, hir to fonde.                           1155\r\n\r\n  166. With-outen more, shortly for to seyne,\r\n  He moste obeye un-to his lady heste;\r\n  And for the lasse harm, he moste feyne.\r\n  He seyde hir, whan she was at swiche a feste\r\n  She mighte on him han loked at the leste;                            1160\r\n  Not I not what, al dere y-nough a risshe,\r\n  As he that nedes moste a cause fisshe.\r\n\r\n  167. And she answerde, 'swete, al were it so,\r\n  What harm was that, sin I non yvel mene?\r\n  For, by that god that boughte us bothe two,                          1165\r\n  In alle thinge is myn entente clene.\r\n  Swich arguments ne been not worth a bene;\r\n  Wol ye the childish Ialous contrefete?\r\n  Now were it worthy that ye were y-bete.'\r\n\r\n  168. Tho Troilus gan sorwfully to syke,                              1170\r\n  Lest she be wrooth, him thoughte his herte deyde;\r\n  And seyde, 'allas! upon my sorwes syke\r\n  Have mercy, swete herte myn, Cryseyde!\r\n  And if that, in tho wordes that I seyde,\r\n  Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace;                                1175\r\n  Do what yow list, I am al in your grace.'\r\n\r\n  169. And she answerde, 'of gilt misericorde!\r\n  That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this;\r\n  And ever-more on this night yow recorde,\r\n  And beth wel war ye do no more amis.'                                1180\r\n  'Nay, dere herte myn,' quod he, 'y-wis.'\r\n  'And now,' quod she, 'that I have do yow smerte,\r\n  Foryeve it me, myn owene swete herte.'\r\n\r\n  170. This Troilus, with blisse of that supprysed,\r\n  Put al in goddes hond, as he that mente                              1185\r\n  No-thing but wel; and, sodeynly avysed,\r\n  He hir in armes faste to him hente.\r\n  And Pandarus, with a ful good entente,\r\n  Leyde him to slepe, and seyde, 'if ye ben wyse,\r\n  Swowneth not now, lest more folk aryse.'                             1190\r\n\r\n  171. What mighte or may the sely larke seye,\r\n  Whan that the sparhauk hath it in his foot?\r\n  I can no more, but of thise ilke tweye,\r\n  To whom this tale sucre be or soot,\r\n  Though that I tarie a yeer, som-tyme I moot,                         1195\r\n  After myn auctor, tellen hir gladnesse,\r\n  As wel as I have told hir hevinesse.\r\n\r\n  172. Criseyde, which that felte hir thus y-take,\r\n  As writen clerkes in hir bokes olde,\r\n  Right as an aspes leef she gan to quake,                             1200\r\n  Whan she him felte hir in his armes folde.\r\n  But Troilus, al hool of cares colde,\r\n  Gan thanken tho the blisful goddes sevene;\r\n  Thus sondry peynes bringen folk to hevene.\r\n\r\n  173. This Troilus in armes gan hir streyne,                          1205\r\n  And seyde, 'O swete, as ever mote I goon,\r\n  Now be ye caught, now is ther but we tweyne;\r\n  Now yeldeth yow, for other boot is noon.'\r\n  To that Criseyde answerde thus anoon,\r\n  'Ne hadde I er now, my swete herte dere,                             1210\r\n  Ben yolde, y-wis, I were now not here!'\r\n\r\n  174. O! sooth is seyd, that heled for to be\r\n  As of a fevre or othere greet syknesse,\r\n  Men moste drinke, as men may often see,\r\n  Ful bittre drink; and for to han gladnesse,                          1215\r\n  Men drinken often peyne and greet distresse;\r\n  I mene it here, as for this aventure,\r\n  That thourgh a peyne hath founden al his cure.\r\n\r\n  175. And now swetnesse semeth more sweet,\r\n  That bitternesse assayed was biforn;                                 1220\r\n  For out of wo in blisse now they flete.\r\n  Non swich they felten, sith they were born;\r\n  Now is this bet, than bothe two be lorn!\r\n  For love of god, take every womman hede\r\n  To werken thus, if it comth to the nede.                             1225\r\n\r\n  176. Criseyde, al quit from every drede and tene,\r\n  As she that iuste cause hadde him to triste,\r\n  Made him swich feste, it Ioye was to sene,\r\n  Whan she his trouthe and clene entente wiste.\r\n  And as aboute a tree, with many a twiste,                            1230\r\n  Bitrent and wryth the sote wode-binde,\r\n  Gan eche of hem in armes other winde.\r\n\r\n  177. And as the newe abaysshed nightingale,\r\n  That stinteth first whan she biginneth singe,\r\n  Whan that she hereth any herde tale,                                 1235\r\n  Or in the hegges any wight steringe,\r\n  And after siker dooth hir voys out-ringe;\r\n  Right so Criseyde, whan hir drede stente,\r\n  Opned hir herte, and tolde him hir entente.\r\n\r\n  178.

Hir armes smale, hir streyghte bak and softe,\r\n  Hir sydes longe, fleshly, smothe, and whyte\r\n  He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad ful ofte\r\n  Hir snowish throte, hir brestes rounde and lyte;                     1250\r\n  Thus in this hevene he gan him to delyte,\r\n  And ther-with-al a thousand tyme hir kiste;\r\n  That, what to done, for Ioye unnethe he wiste.\r\n\r\n  180. Than seyde he thus, 'O, Love, O, Charitee,\r\n  Thy moder eek, Citherea the swete,                                   1255\r\n  After thy-self next heried be she,\r\n  Venus mene I, the wel-willy planete;\r\n  And next that, Imenëus, I thee grete;\r\n  For never man was to yow goddes holde\r\n  As I, which ye han brought fro cares colde.                          1260\r\n\r\n  181.

For myne wordes, here and every part,\r\n  I speke hem alle under correccioun\r\n  Of yow, that feling han in loves art,\r\n  And putte it al in your discrecioun\r\n  To encrese or maken diminucioun                                      1335\r\n  Of my langage, and that I yow bi-seche;\r\n  But now to purpos of my rather speche.\r\n\r\n  192. Thise ilke two, that ben in armes laft,\r\n  So looth to hem a-sonder goon it were,\r\n  That ech from other wende been biraft,                               1340\r\n  Or elles, lo, this was hir moste fere,\r\n  That al this thing but nyce dremes were;\r\n  For which ful ofte ech of hem seyde, 'O swete,\r\n  Clippe ich yow thus, or elles I it mete?'\r\n\r\n  193. And, lord! so he gan goodly on hir see,                         1345\r\n  That never his look ne bleynte from hir face,\r\n  And seyde, 'O dere herte, may it be\r\n  That it be sooth, that ye ben in this place?'\r\n  'Ye, herte myn, god thank I of his grace!'\r\n  Quod tho Criseyde, and therwith-al him kiste,                        1350\r\n  That where his spirit was, for Ioye he niste.\r\n\r\n  194. This Troilus ful ofte hir eyen two\r\n  Gan for to kisse, and seyde, 'O eyen clere,\r\n  It were ye that wroughte me swich wo,\r\n  Ye humble nettes of my lady dere!                                    1355\r\n  Though ther be mercy writen in your chere,\r\n  God wot, the text ful hard is, sooth, to finde,\r\n  How coude ye with-outen bond me binde?'\r\n\r\n  195.

Sone after this they speke of sondry thinges,\r\n  As fil to purpos of this aventure,\r\n  And pleyinge entrechaungeden hir ringes,\r\n  Of which I can nought tellen no scripture;\r\n  But wel I woot a broche, gold and asure,                             1370\r\n  In whiche a ruby set was lyk an herte,\r\n  Criseyde him yaf, and stak it on his sherte.\r\n\r\n  197. Lord! trowe ye, a coveitous, a wrecche,\r\n  That blameth love and holt of it despyt,\r\n  That, of tho pens that he can mokre and kecche,                      1375\r\n  Was ever yet y-yeve him swich delyt,\r\n  As is in love, in oo poynt, in som plyt?\r\n  Nay, doutelees, for also god me save,\r\n  So parfit Ioye may no nigard have!\r\n\r\n  198. They wol sey 'yis,' but lord! so that they lye,                 1380\r\n  Tho bisy wrecches, ful of wo and drede!\r\n  They callen love a woodnesse or folye,\r\n  But it shal falle hem as I shal yow rede;\r\n  They shul forgo the whyte and eke the rede,\r\n  And live in wo, ther god yeve hem mischaunce,                        1385\r\n  And every lover in his trouthe avaunce!\r\n\r\n  199. As wolde god, tho wrecches, that dispyse\r\n  Servyse of love, hadde eres al-so longe\r\n  As hadde Myda, ful of coveityse;\r\n  And ther-to dronken hadde as hoot and stronge                        1390\r\n  As Crassus dide for his affectis wronge,\r\n  To techen hem that they ben in the vyce,\r\n  And loveres nought, al-though they holde hem nyce!\r\n\r\n  200. Thise ilke two, of whom that I yow seye,\r\n  Whan that hir hertes wel assured were,                               1395\r\n  Tho gonne they to speken and to pleye,\r\n  And eek rehercen how, and whanne, and where,\r\n  They knewe hem first, and every wo and fere\r\n  That passed was; but al swich hevinesse,\r\n  I thanke it god, was tourned to gladnesse.                           1400\r\n\r\n  201. And ever-mo, whan that hem fel to speke\r\n  Of any thing of swich a tyme agoon,\r\n  With kissing al that tale sholde breke,\r\n  And fallen in a newe Ioye anoon,\r\n  And diden al hir might, sin they were oon,                           1405\r\n  For to recoveren blisse and been at ese,\r\n  And passed wo with Ioye countrepeyse.\r\n\r\n  202. Reson wil not that I speke of sleep,\r\n  For it accordeth nought to my matere;\r\n  God woot, they toke of that ful litel keep,                          1410\r\n  But lest this night, that was to hem so dere,\r\n  Ne sholde in veyn escape in no manere,\r\n  It was biset in Ioye and bisinesse\r\n  Of al that souneth in-to gentilnesse.\r\n\r\n  203.

'Myn hertes lyf, my trist and my plesaunce,\r\n  That I was born, allas! what me is wo,\r\n  That day of us mot make desseveraunce!\r\n  For tyme it is to ryse, and hennes go,                               1425\r\n  Or elles I am lost for evermo!\r\n  O night, allas! why niltow over us hove,\r\n  As longe as whanne Almena lay by Iove?\r\n\r\n  205.

This Troilus, that with tho wordes felte,\r\n  As thoughte him tho, for pietous distresse,\r\n  The blody teres from his herte melte,                                1445\r\n  As he that never yet swich hevinesse\r\n  Assayed hadde, out of so greet gladnesse,\r\n  Gan therwith-al Criseyde his lady dere\r\n  In armes streyne, and seyde in this manere:--\r\n\r\n  208. 'O cruel day, accusour of the Ioye                              1450\r\n  That night and love han stole and faste y-wryen,\r\n  A-cursed be thy coming in-to Troye,\r\n  For every bore hath oon of thy bright yën!\r\n  Envyous day, what list thee so to spyen?\r\n  What hastow lost, why sekestow this place,                           1455\r\n  Ther god thy lyght so quenche, for his grace?\r\n\r\n  209. Allas! what han thise loveres thee agilt,\r\n  Dispitous day? thyn be the pyne of helle!\r\n  For many a lovere hastow shent, and wilt;\r\n  Thy pouring in wol no-wher lete hem dwelle.                          1460\r\n  What proferestow thy light here for to selle?\r\n  Go selle it hem that smale seles graven,\r\n  We wol thee nought, us nedeth no day haven.'\r\n\r\n  210. And eek the sonne Tytan gan he chyde,\r\n  And seyde, 'O fool, wel may men thee dispyse,                        1465\r\n  That hast the Dawing al night by thy syde,\r\n  And suffrest hir so sone up fro thee ryse,\r\n  For to disesen loveres in this wyse.\r\n  What! hold your bed ther, thou, and eek thy Morwe!\r\n  I bidde god, so yeve yow bothe sorwe!'                               1470\r\n\r\n  211. Therwith ful sore he sighte, and thus he seyde,\r\n  'My lady right, and of my wele or wo\r\n  The welle and rote, O goodly myn, Criseyde,\r\n  And shal I ryse, allas! and shal I go?\r\n  Now fele I that myn herte moot a-two!                                1475\r\n  For how sholde I my lyf an houre save,\r\n  Sin that with yow is al the lyf I have?\r\n\r\n  212. What shal I doon, for certes, I not how,\r\n  Ne whanne, allas!

To that Cryseyde answerde right anoon,\r\n  And with a syk she seyde, 'O herte dere,\r\n  The game, y-wis, so ferforth now is goon,\r\n  That first shal Phebus falle fro his spere,                          1495\r\n  And every egle been the dowves fere,\r\n  And every roche out of his place sterte,\r\n  Er Troilus out of Criseydes herte!\r\n\r\n  215.

Agayns his wil, sin it mot nedes be,                            1520\r\n  This Troilus up roos, and faste him cledde,\r\n  And in his armes took his lady free\r\n  An hundred tyme, and on his wey him spedde,\r\n  And with swich wordes as his herte bledde,\r\n  He seyde, 'farewel, my dere herte swete,                             1525\r\n  Ther god us graunte sounde and sone to mete!'\r\n\r\n  219. To which no word for sorwe she answerde,\r\n  So sore gan his parting hir destreyne;\r\n  And Troilus un-to his palays ferde,\r\n  As woo bigon as she was, sooth to seyne;                             1530\r\n  So hard him wrong of sharp desyr the peyne\r\n  For to ben eft there he was in plesaunce,\r\n  That it may never out of his remembraunce.\r\n\r\n  220.

And in his thought gan up and doun to winde\r\n  Hir wordes alle, and every contenaunce,\r\n  And fermely impressen in his minde\r\n  The leste poynt that to him was plesaunce;\r\n  And verrayliche, of thilke remembraunce,                             1545\r\n  Desyr al newe him brende, and lust to brede\r\n  Gan more than erst, and yet took he non hede.\r\n\r\n  222.

Pandare, a-morwe which that comen was                           1555\r\n  Un-to his nece, and gan hir fayre grete,\r\n  Seyde, 'al this night so reyned it, allas!\r\n  That al my drede is that ye, nece swete,\r\n  Han litel layser had to slepe and mete;\r\n  Al night,' quod he, 'hath reyn so do me wake,                        1560\r\n  That som of us, I trowe, hir hedes ake.'\r\n\r\n  224. And ner he com, and seyde, 'how stont it now\r\n  This mery morwe, nece, how can ye fare?'\r\n  Criseyde answerde, 'never the bet for yow,\r\n  Fox that ye been, god yeve your herte care!                          1565\r\n  God helpe me so, ye caused al this fare,\r\n  Trow I,' quod she, 'for alle your wordes whyte;\r\n  O! who-so seeth yow knoweth yow ful lyte!'\r\n\r\n  225. With that she gan hir face for to wrye\r\n  With the shete, and wex for shame al reed;                           1570\r\n  And Pandarus gan under for to prye,\r\n  And seyde, 'nece, if that I shal ben deed,\r\n  Have here a swerd, and smyteth of myn heed.'\r\n  With that his arm al sodeynly he thriste\r\n  Under hir nekke, and at the laste hir kiste.                         1575\r\n\r\n  226. I passe al that which chargeth nought to seye,\r\n  What! God foryaf his deeth, and she al-so\r\n  Foryaf, and with hir uncle gan to pleye,\r\n  For other cause was ther noon than so.\r\n  But of this thing right to the effect to go,                         1580\r\n  Whan tyme was, hom til hir hous she wente,\r\n  And Pandarus hath fully his entente.\r\n\r\n  227. Now torne we ayein to Troilus,\r\n  That resteles ful longe a-bedde lay,\r\n  And prevely sente after Pandarus,                                    1585\r\n  To him to come in al the haste he may.\r\n  He com anoon, nought ones seyde he 'nay,'\r\n  And Troilus ful sobrely he grette,\r\n  And doun upon his beddes syde him sette.\r\n\r\n  228. This Troilus, with al the affeccioun                            1590\r\n  Of frendes love that herte may devyse,\r\n  To Pandarus on kneës fil adoun,\r\n  And er that he wolde of the place aryse,\r\n  He gan him thonken in his beste wyse;\r\n  A hondred sythe he gan the tyme blesse,                              1595\r\n  That he was born to bringe him fro distresse.\r\n\r\n  229. He seyde, 'O frend, of frendes the alderbeste\r\n  That ever was, the sothe for to telle,\r\n  Thou hast in hevene y-brought my soule at reste\r\n  Fro Flegiton, the fery flood of helle;                               1600\r\n  That, though I mighte a thousand tymes selle,\r\n  Upon a day, my lyf in thy servyse,\r\n  It mighte nought a mote in that suffyse.\r\n\r\n  230. The sonne, which that al the world may see,\r\n  Saw never yet, my lyf, that dar I leye,                              1605\r\n  So inly fair and goodly as is she,\r\n  Whos I am al, and shal, til that I deye;\r\n  And, that I thus am hires, dar I seye,\r\n  That thanked be the heighe worthinesse\r\n  Of love, and eek thy kinde bisinesse.                                1610\r\n\r\n  231. Thus hastow me no litel thing y-yive,\r\n  Fo which to thee obliged be for ay\r\n  My lyf, and why? for thorugh thyn help I live;\r\n  For elles deed hadde I be many a day.'\r\n  And with that word doun in his bed he lay,                           1615\r\n  And Pandarus ful sobrely him herde\r\n  Til al was seyd, and thanne he him answerde:\r\n\r\n  232. 'My dere frend, if I have doon for thee\r\n  In any cas, god wot, it is me leef;\r\n  And am as glad as man may of it be,                                  1620\r\n  God help me so; but tak now not a-greef\r\n  That I shal seyn, be war of this myscheef,\r\n  That, there-as thou now brought art in-to blisse,\r\n  That thou thy-self ne cause it nought to misse.\r\n\r\n  233. For of fortunes sharp adversitee                                1625\r\n  The worst kinde of infortune is this,\r\n  A man to have ben in prosperitee,\r\n  And it remembren, whan it passed is.\r\n  Thou art wys y-nough, for-thy do nought amis;\r\n  Be not to rakel, though thou sitte warme,                            1630\r\n  For if thou be, certeyn, it wol thee harme.\r\n\r\n  234. Thou art at ese, and holde thee wel ther-inne.\r\n  For also seur as reed is every fyr,\r\n  As greet a craft is kepe wel as winne;\r\n  Brydle alwey wel thy speche and thy desyr.                           1635\r\n  For worldly Ioye halt not but by a wyr;\r\n  That preveth wel, it brest alday so ofte;\r\n  For-thy nede is to werke with it softe.'\r\n\r\n  235. Quod Troilus, 'I hope, and god to-forn,\r\n  My dere frend, that I shal so me bere,                               1640\r\n  That in my gilt ther shal no thing be lorn,\r\n  Ne I nil not rakle as for to greven here;\r\n  It nedeth not this matere ofte tere;\r\n  For wistestow myn herte wel, Pandare,\r\n  God woot, of this thou woldest litel care.'                          1645\r\n\r\n  236. Tho gan he telle him of his glade night.\r\n  And wher-of first his herte dredde, and how,\r\n  And seyde, 'freend, as I am trewe knight,\r\n  And by that feyth I shal to god and yow,\r\n  I hadde it never half so hote as now;                                1650\r\n  And ay the more that desyr me byteth\r\n  To love hir best, the more it me delyteth.\r\n\r\n  237. I noot my-self not wisly what it is;\r\n  But now I fele a newe qualitee,\r\n  Ye, al another than I dide er this.'                                 1655\r\n  Pandare answerde, and seyde thus, that he\r\n  That ones may in hevene blisse be,\r\n  He feleth other weyes, dar I leye,\r\n  Than thilke tyme he first herde of it seye.\r\n\r\n  238. This is o word for al; this Troilus                             1660\r\n  Was never ful, to speke of this matere,\r\n  And for to preysen un-to Pandarus\r\n  The bountee of his righte lady dere,\r\n  And Pandarus to thanke and maken chere.\r\n  This tale ay was span-newe to biginne                                1665\r\n  Til that the night departed hem a-twinne.\r\n\r\n  239. Sone after this, for that fortune it wolde,\r\n  I-comen was the blisful tyme swete,\r\n  That Troilus was warned that he sholde,\r\n  Ther he was erst, Criseyde his lady mete;                            1670\r\n  For which he felte his herte in Ioye flete;\r\n  And feythfully gan alle the goddes herie;\r\n  And lat see now if that he can be merie.\r\n\r\n  240. And holden was the forme and al the wyse,\r\n  Of hir cominge, and eek of his also,                                 1675\r\n  As it was erst, which nedeth nought devyse.\r\n  But playnly to the effect right for to go,\r\n  In Ioye and seurte Pandarus hem two\r\n  A-bedde broughte, whan hem bothe leste,\r\n  And thus they ben in quiete and in reste.                            1680\r\n\r\n  241. Nought nedeth it to yow, sin they ben met,\r\n  To aske at me if that they blythe were;\r\n  For if it erst was wel, tho was it bet\r\n  A thousand-fold, this nedeth not enquere.\r\n  A-gon was every sorwe and every fere;                                1685\r\n  And bothe, y-wis, they hadde, and so they wende,\r\n  As muche Ioye as herte may comprende.\r\n\r\n  242. This is no litel thing of for to seye,\r\n  This passeth every wit for to devyse;\r\n  For eche of hem gan otheres lust obeye;                              1690\r\n  Felicitee, which that thise clerkes wyse\r\n  Commenden so, ne may not here suffyse.\r\n  This Ioye may not writen been with inke,\r\n  This passeth al that herte may bithinke.\r\n\r\n  243. But cruel day, so wel-awey the stounde!                         1695\r\n  Gan for to aproche, as they by signes knewe,\r\n  For whiche hem thoughte felen dethes wounde;\r\n  So wo was hem, that changen gan hir hewe,\r\n  And day they gonnen to dispyse al newe,\r\n  Calling it traytour, envyous, and worse,                             1700\r\n  And bitterly the dayes light they curse.\r\n\r\n  244. Quod Troilus, 'allas! now am I war\r\n  That Pirous and tho swifte stedes three,\r\n  Whiche that drawen forth the sonnes char,\r\n  Han goon som by-path in despyt of me;                                1705\r\n  That maketh it so sone day to be;\r\n  And, for the sonne him hasteth thus to ryse,\r\n  Ne shal I never doon him sacrifyse!'\r\n\r\n  245. But nedes day departe moste hem sone,\r\n  And whanne hir speche doon was and hir chere,                        1710\r\n  They twinne anoon as they were wont to done,\r\n  And setten tyme of meting eft y-fere;\r\n  And many a night they wroughte in this manere.\r\n  And thus Fortune a tyme ladde in Ioye\r\n  Criseyde, and eek this kinges sone of Troye.                         1715\r\n\r\n  246. In suffisaunce, in blisse, and in singinges,\r\n  This Troilus gan al his lyf to lede;\r\n  He spendeth, Iusteth, maketh festeyinges;\r\n  He yeveth frely ofte, and chaungeth wede,\r\n  And held aboute him alwey, out of drede,                             1720\r\n  A world of folk, as cam him wel of kinde,\r\n  The fressheste and the beste he coude fynde;\r\n\r\n  247. That swich a voys was of hym and a stevene\r\n  Thorugh-out the world, of honour and largesse,\r\n  That it up rong un-to the yate of hevene.                            1725\r\n  And, as in love, he was in swich gladnesse,\r\n  That in his herte he demede, as I gesse,\r\n  That there nis lovere in this world at ese\r\n  So wel as he, and thus gan love him plese.\r\n\r\n  248. The godlihede or beautee which that kinde                       1730\r\n  In any other lady hadde y-set\r\n  Can not the mountaunce of a knot unbinde,\r\n  A-boute his herte, of al Criseydes net.\r\n  He was so narwe y-masked and y-knet,\r\n  That it undon on any manere syde,                                    1735\r\n  That nil not been, for ought that may betyde.\r\n\r\n  249. And by the hond ful ofte he wolde take\r\n  This Pandarus, and in-to gardin lede,\r\n  And swich a feste and swich a proces make\r\n  Him of Criseyde, and of hir womanhede,                               1740\r\n  And of hir beautee, that, with-outen drede,\r\n  It was an hevene his wordes for to here;\r\n  And thanne he wolde singe in this manere.\r\n\r\n  250. 'Love, that of erthe and see hath governaunce,\r\n  Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye,                            1745\r\n  Love, that with an holsom alliaunce\r\n  Halt peples ioyned, as him list hem gye,\r\n  Love, that knetteth lawe of companye,\r\n  And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle,\r\n  Bind this acord, that I have told and telle;                         1750\r\n\r\n  251. That that the world with feyth, which that is stable,\r\n  Dyverseth so his stoundes concordinge,\r\n  That elements that been so discordable\r\n  Holden a bond perpetuely duringe,\r\n  That Phebus mote his rosy day forth bringe,                          1755\r\n  And that the mone hath lordship over the nightes,\r\n  Al this doth Love; ay heried be his mightes!\r\n\r\n  252. That that the see, that gredy is to flowen,\r\n  Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so\r\n  His flodes, that so fersly they ne growen                            1760\r\n  To drenchen erthe and al for ever-mo;\r\n  And if that Love ought lete his brydel go,\r\n  Al that now loveth a-sonder sholde lepe,\r\n  And lost were al, that Love halt now to-hepe.\r\n\r\n  253. So wolde god, that auctor is of kinde,                          1765\r\n  That, with his bond, Love of his vertu liste\r\n  To cerclen hertes alle, and faste binde,\r\n  That from his bond no wight the wey out wiste.\r\n  And hertes colde, hem wolde I that he twiste\r\n  To make hem love, and that hem leste ay rewe                         1770\r\n  On hertes sore, and kepe hem that ben trewe.'\r\n\r\n  254. In alle nedes, for the tounes werre,\r\n  He was, and ay the firste in armes dight;\r\n  And certeynly, but-if that bokes erre,\r\n  Save Ector, most y-drad of any wight;                                1775\r\n  And this encrees of hardinesse and might\r\n  Cam him of love, his ladies thank to winne,\r\n  That altered his spirit so with-inne.\r\n\r\n  255. In tyme of trewe, on haukinge wolde he ryde,\r\n  Or elles hunten boor, bere, or lyoun;                                1780\r\n  The smale bestes leet he gon bi-syde.\r\n  And whan that he com rydinge in-to toun,\r\n  Ful ofte his lady, from hir window doun,\r\n  As fresh as faucon comen out of muwe,\r\n  Ful redy was, him goodly to saluwe.                                  1785\r\n\r\n  256. And most of love and vertu was his speche,\r\n  And in despyt hadde alle wrecchednesse;\r\n  And doutelees, no nede was him biseche\r\n  To honouren hem that hadde worthinesse,\r\n  And esen hem that weren in distresse.                                1790\r\n  And glad was he if any wight wel ferde,\r\n  That lover was, whan he it wiste or herde.\r\n\r\n  257. For sooth to seyn, he lost held every wight\r\n  But-if he were in loves heigh servyse,\r\n  I mene folk that oughte it been of right.                            1795\r\n  And over al this, so wel coude he devyse\r\n  Of sentement, and in so unkouth wyse\r\n  Al his array, that every lover thoughte,\r\n  That al was wel, what-so he seyde or wroughte.\r\n\r\n  258. And though that he be come of blood royal,                      1800\r\n  Him liste of pryde at no wight for to chase;\r\n  Benigne he was to ech in general,\r\n  For which he gat him thank in every place.\r\n  Thus wolde Love, y-heried be his grace,\r\n  That Pryde, Envye, Ire, and Avaryce                                  1805\r\n  He gan to flee, and every other vyce.\r\n\r\n  259. Thou lady bright, the doughter to Dione,\r\n  Thy blinde and winged sone eek, daun Cupyde;\r\n  Ye sustren nyne eek, that by Elicone\r\n  In hil Parnaso listen for to abyde,                                  1810\r\n  That ye thus fer han deyned me to gyde,\r\n  I can no more, but sin that ye wol wende,\r\n  Ye heried been for ay, with-outen ende!\r\n\r\n  260. Thourgh yow have I seyd fully in my song\r\n  Theffect and Ioye of Troilus servyse,                                1815\r\n  Al be that ther was som disese among,\r\n  As to myn auctor listeth to devyse.\r\n  My thridde book now ende ich in this wyse;\r\n  And Troilus in luste and in quiete\r\n  Is with Criseyde, his owne herte swete.                              1820\r\n\r\nEXPLICIT LIBER TERCIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUBRIC; _from_ Cp. 1-56. _Lost in_ Cm. 3.

Ligginge in ost, as I have seyd er this,\r\n  The Grekes stronge, aboute Troye toun,                                 30\r\n  Bifel that, whan that Phebus shyning is\r\n  Up-on the brest of Hercules Lyoun,\r\n  That Ector, with ful many a bold baroun,\r\n  Caste on a day with Grekes for to fighte,\r\n  As he was wont to greve hem what he mighte.                            35\r\n\r\n  6. Not I how longe or short it was bitwene\r\n  This purpos and that day they fighte mente;\r\n  But on a day wel armed, bright and shene,\r\n  Ector, and many a worthy wight out wente,\r\n  With spere in hond and bigge bowes bente;                              40\r\n  And in the berd, with-oute lenger lette,\r\n  Hir fomen in the feld anoon hem mette.\r\n\r\n  7. The longe day, with speres sharpe y-grounde,\r\n  With arwes, dartes, swerdes, maces felle,\r\n  They fighte and bringen hors and man to grounde,                       45\r\n  And with hir axes out the braynes quelle.\r\n  But in the laste shour, sooth for to telle,\r\n  The folk of Troye hem-selven so misledden,\r\n  That with the worse at night homward they fledden.\r\n\r\n  8. At whiche day was taken Antenor,                                    50\r\n  Maugre Polydamas or Monesteo,\r\n  Santippe, Sarpedon, Polynestor,\r\n  Polyte, or eek the Troian daun Ripheo,\r\n  And othere lasse folk, as Phebuseo.\r\n  So that, for harm, that day the folk of Troye                          55\r\n  Dredden to lese a greet part of hir Ioye.\r\n\r\n  9. Of Pryamus was yeve, at Greek requeste,\r\n  A tyme of trewe, and tho they gonnen trete,\r\n  Hir prisoneres to chaungen, moste and leste,\r\n  And for the surplus yeven sommes grete.                                60\r\n  This thing anoon was couth in every strete,\r\n  Bothe in thassege, in toune, and every-where,\r\n  And with the firste it cam to Calkas ere.\r\n\r\n  10. Whan Calkas knew this tretis sholde holde,\r\n  In consistorie, among the Grekes, sone                                 65\r\n  He gan in thringe forth, with lordes olde,\r\n  And sette him there-as he was wont to done;\r\n  And with a chaunged face hem bad a bone,\r\n  For love of god, to don that reverence,\r\n  To stinte noyse, and yeve him audience.                                70\r\n\r\n  11. Thanne seyde he thus, 'lo! lordes myne, I was\r\n  Troian, as it is knowen out of drede;\r\n  And if that yow remembre, I am Calkas,\r\n  That alderfirst yaf comfort to your nede,\r\n  And tolde wel how that ye sholden spede.                               75\r\n  For dredelees, thorugh yow, shal, in a stounde,\r\n  Ben Troye y-brend, and beten doun to grounde.\r\n\r\n  12. And in what forme, or in what maner wyse\r\n  This town to shende, and al your lust to acheve,\r\n  Ye han er this wel herd it me devyse;                                  80\r\n  This knowe ye, my lordes, as I leve.\r\n  And for the Grekes weren me so leve,\r\n  I com my-self in my propre persone,\r\n  To teche in this how yow was best to done;\r\n\r\n  13. Havinge un-to my tresour ne my rente                               85\r\n  Right no resport, to respect of your ese.\r\n  Thus al my good I loste and to yow wente,\r\n  Wening in this you, lordes, for to plese.\r\n  But al that los ne doth me no disese.\r\n  I vouche-sauf, as wisly have I Ioye,                                   90\r\n  For you to lese al that I have in Troye,\r\n\r\n  14. Save of a doughter, that I lafte, allas!\r\n  Slepinge at hoom, whanne out of Troye I sterte.\r\n  O sterne, O cruel fader that I was!\r\n  How mighte I have in that so hard an herte?                            95\r\n  Allas! I ne hadde y-brought hir in hir sherte!\r\n  For sorwe of which I wol not live to morwe,\r\n  But-if ye lordes rewe up-on my sorwe.\r\n\r\n  15. For, by that cause I say no tyme er now\r\n  Hir to delivere, I holden have my pees;                               100\r\n  But now or never, if that it lyke yow,\r\n  I may hir have right sone, doutelees.\r\n  O help and grace! amonges al this prees,\r\n  Rewe on this olde caitif in destresse,\r\n  Sin I through yow have al this hevinesse!                             105\r\n\r\n  16. Ye have now caught and fetered in prisoun\r\n  Troians y-nowe; and if your willes be,\r\n  My child with oon may have redempcioun.\r\n  Now for the love of god and of bountee,\r\n  Oon of so fele, allas! so yeve him me.                                110\r\n  What nede were it this preyere for to werne,\r\n  Sin ye shul bothe han folk and toun as yerne?\r\n\r\n  17. On peril of my lyf, I shal not lye,\r\n  Appollo hath me told it feithfully;\r\n  I have eek founde it by astronomye,                                   115\r\n  By sort, and by augurie eek trewely,\r\n  And dar wel seye, the tyme is faste by,\r\n  That fyr and flaumbe on al the toun shal sprede;\r\n  And thus shal Troye turne in asshen dede.\r\n\r\n  18. For certeyn, Phebus and Neptunus bothe,                           120\r\n  That makeden the walles of the toun,\r\n  Ben with the folk of Troye alwey so wrothe,\r\n  That thei wol bringe it to confusioun,\r\n  Right in despyt of king Lameadoun.\r\n  By-cause he nolde payen hem hir hyre,                                 125\r\n  The toun of Troye shal ben set on-fyre.'\r\n\r\n  19. Telling his tale alwey, this olde greye,\r\n  Humble in speche, and in his lokinge eke,\r\n  The salte teres from his eyën tweye\r\n  Ful faste ronnen doun by eyther cheke.                                130\r\n  So longe he gan of socour hem by-seke\r\n  That, for to hele him of his sorwes sore,\r\n  They yave him Antenor, with-oute more.\r\n\r\n  20. But who was glad y-nough but Calkas tho?\r\n  And of this thing ful sone his nedes leyde                            135\r\n  On hem that sholden for the tretis go,\r\n  And hem for Antenor ful ofte preyde\r\n  To bringen hoom king Toas and Criseyde;\r\n  And whan Pryam his save-garde sente,\r\n  Thembassadours to Troye streyght they wente.                          140\r\n\r\n  21. The cause y-told of hir cominge, the olde\r\n  Pryam the king ful sone in general\r\n  Let here-upon his parlement to holde,\r\n  Of which the effect rehersen yow I shal.\r\n  Thembassadours ben answered for fynal,                                145\r\n  Theschaunge of prisoners and al this nede\r\n  Hem lyketh wel, and forth in they procede.\r\n\r\n  22. This Troilus was present in the place,\r\n  Whan axed was for Antenor Criseyde,\r\n  For which ful sone chaungen gan his face,                             150\r\n  As he that with tho wordes wel neigh deyde.\r\n  But nathelees, he no word to it seyde,\r\n  Lest men sholde his affeccioun espye;\r\n  With mannes herte he gan his sorwes drye.\r\n\r\n  23. And ful of anguish and of grisly drede                            155\r\n  Abood what lordes wolde un-to it seye;\r\n  And if they wolde graunte, as god forbede,\r\n  Theschaunge of hir, than thoughte he thinges tweye,\r\n  First, how to save hir honour, and what weye\r\n  He mighte best theschaunge of hir withstonde;                         160\r\n  Ful faste he caste how al this mighte stonde.\r\n\r\n  24. Love him made al prest to doon hir byde,\r\n  And rather dye than she sholde go;\r\n  But resoun seyde him, on that other syde,\r\n  'With-oute assent of hir ne do not so,                                165\r\n  Lest for thy werk she wolde be thy fo,\r\n  And seyn, that thorugh thy medling is y-blowe\r\n  Your bother love, there it was erst unknowe.'\r\n\r\n  25. For which he gan deliberen, for the beste,\r\n  That though the lordes wolde that she wente,                          170\r\n  He wolde late hem graunte what hem leste,\r\n  And telle his lady first what that they mente.\r\n  And whan that she had seyd him hir entente,\r\n  Ther-after wolde he werken also blyve,\r\n  Though al the world ayein it wolde stryve.                            175\r\n\r\n  26. Ector, which that wel the Grekes herde,\r\n  For Antenor how they wolde han Criseyde,\r\n  Gan it withstonde, and sobrely answerde:--\r\n  'Sires, she nis no prisoner,' he seyde;\r\n  'I noot on yow who that this charge leyde,                            180\r\n  But, on my part, ye may eft-sone him telle,\r\n  We usen here no wommen for to selle.'\r\n\r\n  27. The noyse of peple up-stirte thanne at ones,\r\n  As breme as blase of straw y-set on fyre;\r\n  For infortune it wolde, for the nones,                                185\r\n  They sholden hir confusioun desyre.\r\n  'Ector,' quod they, 'what goost may yow enspyre,\r\n  This womman thus to shilde and doon us lese\r\n  Daun Antenor?--a wrong wey now ye chese--\r\n\r\n  28. That is so wys, and eek so bold baroun,                           190\r\n  And we han nede of folk, as men may see;\r\n  He is eek oon, the grettest of this toun;\r\n  O Ector, lat tho fantasyës be!\r\n  O king Pryam,' quod they, 'thus seggen we,\r\n  That al our voys is to for-gon Criseyde;'                             195\r\n  And to deliveren Antenor they preyde.\r\n\r\n  29. O Iuvenal, lord! trewe is thy sentence,\r\n  That litel witen folk what is to yerne\r\n  That they ne finde in hir desyr offence;\r\n  For cloud of errour lat hem not descerne                              200\r\n  What best is; and lo, here ensample as yerne.\r\n  This folk desiren now deliveraunce\r\n  Of Antenor, that broughte hem to mischaunce!\r\n\r\n  30. For he was after traytour to the toun\r\n  Of Troye; allas! they quitte him out to rathe;                        205\r\n  O nyce world, lo, thy discrecioun!\r\n  Criseyde, which that never dide hem skathe,\r\n  Shal now no lenger in hir blisse bathe;\r\n  But Antenor, he shal com hoom to toune,\r\n  And she shal out; thus seyden here and howne.                         210\r\n\r\n  31. For which delibered was by parlement,\r\n  For Antenor to yelden up Criseyde,\r\n  And it pronounced by the president,\r\n  Al-theigh that Ector 'nay' ful ofte preyde.\r\n  And fynaly, what wight that it with-seyde,                            215\r\n  It was for nought, it moste been, and sholde;\r\n  For substaunce of the parlement it wolde.\r\n\r\n  32. Departed out of parlement echone,\r\n  This Troilus, with-oute wordes mo,\r\n  Un-to his chaumbre spedde him faste allone,                           220\r\n  But-if it were a man of his or two,\r\n  The whiche he bad out faste for to go,\r\n  By-cause he wolde slepen, as he seyde,\r\n  And hastely up-on his bed him leyde.\r\n\r\n  33. And as in winter leves been biraft,                               225\r\n  Eche after other, til the tree be bare,\r\n  So that ther nis but bark and braunche y-laft,\r\n  Lyth Troilus, biraft of ech wel-fare,\r\n  Y-bounden in the blake bark of care,\r\n  Disposed wood out of his wit to breyde,                               230\r\n  So sore him sat the chaunginge of Criseyde.\r\n\r\n  34. He rist him up, and every dore he shette\r\n  And windowe eek, and tho this sorweful man\r\n  Up-on his beddes syde a-doun him sette,\r\n  Ful lyk a deed image pale and wan;                                    235\r\n  And in his brest the heped wo bigan\r\n  Out-breste, and he to werken in this wyse\r\n  In his woodnesse, as I shal yow devyse.\r\n\r\n  35. Right as the wilde bole biginneth springe\r\n  Now here, now there, y-darted to the herte,                           240\r\n  And of his deeth roreth in compleyninge,\r\n  Right so gan he aboute the chaumbre sterte,\r\n  Smyting his brest ay with his festes smerte;\r\n  His heed to the wal, his body to the grounde\r\n  Ful ofte he swapte, him-selven to confounde.                          245\r\n\r\n  36. His eyen two, for pitee of his herte,\r\n  Out stremeden as swifte welles tweye;\r\n  The heighe sobbes of his sorwes smerte\r\n  His speche him rafte, unnethes mighte he seye,\r\n  'O deeth, allas! why niltow do me deye?                               250\r\n  A-cursed be the day which that nature\r\n  Shoop me to ben a lyves creature!'\r\n\r\n  37. But after, whan the furie and the rage\r\n  Which that his herte twiste and faste threste,\r\n  By lengthe of tyme somwhat gan asswage,                               255\r\n  Up-on his bed he leyde him doun to reste;\r\n  But tho bigonne his teres more out-breste,\r\n  That wonder is, the body may suffyse\r\n  To half this wo, which that I yow devyse.\r\n\r\n  38. Than seyde he thus, 'Fortune! allas the whyle!                    260\r\n  What have I doon, what have I thus a-gilt?\r\n  How mightestow for reuthe me bigyle?\r\n  Is ther no grace, and shal I thus be spilt?\r\n  Shal thus Criseyde awey, for that thou wilt?\r\n  Allas! how maystow in thyn herte finde                                265\r\n  To been to me thus cruel and unkinde?\r\n\r\n  39. Have I thee nought honoured al my lyve,\r\n  As thou wel wost, above the goddes alle?\r\n  Why wiltow me fro Ioye thus depryve?\r\n  O Troilus, what may men now thee calle                                270\r\n  But wrecche of wrecches, out of honour falle\r\n  In-to miserie, in which I wol biwayle\r\n  Criseyde, allas! til that the breeth me fayle?\r\n\r\n  40. Allas, Fortune! if that my lyf in Ioye\r\n  Displesed hadde un-to thy foule envye,                                275\r\n  Why ne haddestow my fader, king of Troye,\r\n  By-raft the lyf, or doon my bretheren dye,\r\n  Or slayn my-self, that thus compleyne and crye,\r\n  I, combre-world, that may of no-thing serve,\r\n  But ever dye, and never fully sterve?                                 280\r\n\r\n  41. If that Criseyde allone were me laft,\r\n  Nought roughte I whider thou woldest me stere;\r\n  And hir, allas! than hastow me biraft.\r\n  But ever-more, lo! this is thy manere,\r\n  To reve a wight that most is to him dere,                             285\r\n  To preve in that thy gerful violence.\r\n  Thus am I lost, ther helpeth no defence!\r\n\r\n  42. O verray lord of love, O god, allas!\r\n  That knowest best myn herte and al my thought,\r\n  What shal my sorwful lyf don in this cas                              290\r\n  If I for-go that I so dere have bought?\r\n  Sin ye Cryseyde and me han fully brought\r\n  In-to your grace, and bothe our hertes seled,\r\n  How may ye suffre, allas! it be repeled?\r\n\r\n  43. What I may doon, I shal, whyl I may dure                          295\r\n  On lyve in torment and in cruel peyne,\r\n  This infortune or this disaventure,\r\n  Allone as I was born, y-wis, compleyne;\r\n  Ne never wil I seen it shyne or reyne;\r\n  But ende I wil, as Edippe, in derknesse                               300\r\n  My sorwful lyf, and dyen in distresse.\r\n\r\n  44. O wery goost, that errest to and fro,\r\n  Why niltow fleen out of the wofulleste\r\n  Body, that ever mighte on grounde go?\r\n  O soule, lurkinge in this wo, unneste,                                305\r\n  Flee forth out of myn herte, and lat it breste,\r\n  And folwe alwey Criseyde, thy lady dere;\r\n  Thy righte place is now no lenger here!\r\n\r\n  45. O wofulle eyen two, sin your disport\r\n  Was al to seen Criseydes eyen brighte,                                310\r\n  What shal ye doon but, for my discomfort,\r\n  Stonden for nought, and wepen out your sighte?\r\n  Sin she is queynt, that wont was yow to lighte,\r\n  In veyn fro-this-forth have I eyen tweye\r\n  Y-formed, sin your vertue is a-weye.                                  315\r\n\r\n  46. O my Criseyde, O lady sovereyne\r\n  Of thilke woful soule that thus cryeth,\r\n  Who shal now yeven comfort to the peyne?\r\n  Allas, no wight; but when myn herte dyeth,\r\n  My spirit, which that so un-to yow hyeth,                             320\r\n  Receyve in gree, for that shal ay yow serve;\r\n  For-thy no fors is, though the body sterve.\r\n\r\n  47. O ye loveres, that heighe upon the wheel\r\n  Ben set of Fortune, in good aventure,\r\n  God leve that ye finde ay love of steel,                              325\r\n  And longe mot your lyf in Ioye endure!\r\n  But whan ye comen by my sepulture,\r\n  Remembreth that your felawe resteth there;\r\n  For I lovede eek, though I unworthy were.\r\n\r\n  48. O olde unholsom and mislyved man,                                 330\r\n  Calkas I mene, allas! what eyleth thee\r\n  To been a Greek, sin thou art born Troian?\r\n  O Calkas, which that wilt my bane be,\r\n  In cursed tyme was thou born for me!\r\n  As wolde blisful Iove, for his Ioye,                                  335\r\n  That I thee hadde, where I wolde, in Troye!'\r\n\r\n  49. A thousand sykes, hottere than the glede,\r\n  Out of his brest ech after other wente,\r\n  Medled with pleyntes newe, his wo to fede,\r\n  For which his woful teres never stente;                               340\r\n  And shortly, so his peynes him to-rente,\r\n  And wex so mat, that Ioye nor penaunce\r\n  He feleth noon, but lyth forth in a traunce.\r\n\r\n  50. Pandare, which that in the parlement\r\n  Hadde herd what every lord and burgeys seyde,                         345\r\n  And how ful graunted was, by oon assent,\r\n  For Antenor to yelden so Criseyde,\r\n  Gan wel neigh wood out of his wit to breyde,\r\n  So that, for wo, he niste what he mente;\r\n  But in a rees to Troilus he wente.                                    350\r\n\r\n  51. A certeyn knight, that for the tyme kepte\r\n  The chaumbre-dore, un-dide it him anoon;\r\n  And Pandare, that ful tendreliche wepte,\r\n  In-to the derke chaumbre, as stille as stoon,\r\n  Toward the bed gan softely to goon,                                   355\r\n  So confus, that he niste what to seye;\r\n  For verray wo his wit was neigh aweye.\r\n\r\n  52. And with his chere and loking al to-torn,\r\n  For sorwe of this, and with his armes folden,\r\n  He stood this woful Troilus biforn,                                   360\r\n  And on his pitous face he gan biholden;\r\n  But lord, so often gan his herte colden,\r\n  Seing his freend in wo, whos hevinesse\r\n  His herte slow, as thoughte him, for distresse.\r\n\r\n  53. This woful wight, this Troilus, that felte                        365\r\n  His freend Pandare y-comen him to see,\r\n  Gan as the snow ayein the sonne melte,\r\n  For which this sorwful Pandare, of pitee,\r\n  Gan for to wepe as tendreliche as he;\r\n  And specheles thus been thise ilke tweye,                             370\r\n  That neyther mighte o word for sorwe seye.\r\n\r\n  54. But at the laste this woful Troilus,\r\n  Ney deed for smert, gan bresten out to rore,\r\n  And with a sorwful noyse he seyde thus,\r\n  Among his sobbes and his sykes sore,                                  375\r\n  'Lo! Pandare, I am deed, with-outen more.\r\n  Hastow nought herd at parlement,' he seyde,\r\n  'For Antenor how lost is my Criseyde?'\r\n\r\n  55. This Pandarus, ful deed and pale of hewe,\r\n  Ful pitously answerde and seyde, 'yis!                                380\r\n  As wisly were it fals as it is trewe,\r\n  That I have herd, and wot al how it is.\r\n  O mercy, god, who wolde have trowed this?\r\n  Who wolde have wend that, in so litel a throwe,\r\n  Fortune our Ioye wolde han over-throwe?                               385\r\n\r\n  56. For in this world ther is no creature,\r\n  As to my doom, that ever saw ruyne\r\n  Straungere than this, thorugh cas or aventure.\r\n  But who may al eschewe or al devyne?\r\n  Swich is this world; for-thy I thus defyne,                           390\r\n  Ne trust no wight to finden in Fortune\r\n  Ay propretee; hir yeftes been comune.\r\n\r\n  57. But tel me this, why thou art now so mad\r\n  To sorwen thus? Why lystow in this wyse,\r\n  Sin thy desyr al holly hastow had,                                    395\r\n  So that, by right, it oughte y-now suffyse?\r\n  But I, that never felte in my servyse\r\n  A frendly chere or loking of an yë,\r\n  Lat me thus wepe and wayle, til I dye.\r\n\r\n  58. And over al this, as thou wel wost thy-selve,                     400\r\n  This town is ful of ladies al aboute;\r\n  And, to my doom, fairer than swiche twelve\r\n  As ever she was, shal I finde, in som route,\r\n  Ye, oon or two, with-outen any doute.\r\n  For-thy be glad, myn owene dere brother,                              405\r\n  If she be lost, we shul recovere another.\r\n\r\n  59. What, god for-bede alwey that ech plesaunce\r\n  In o thing were, and in non other wight!\r\n  If oon can singe, another can wel daunce;\r\n  If this be goodly, she is glad and light;                             410\r\n  And this is fayr, and that can good a-right.\r\n  Ech for his vertu holden is for dere,\r\n  Bothe heroner and faucon for rivere.\r\n\r\n  60. And eek, as writ Zanzis, that was ful wys,\r\n  \"The newe love out chaceth ofte the olde;\"                            415\r\n  And up-on newe cas lyth newe avys.\r\n  Thenk eek, thy-self to saven artow holde;\r\n  Swich fyr, by proces, shal of kinde colde.\r\n  For sin it is but casuel plesaunce,\r\n  Som cas shal putte it out of remembraunce.                            420\r\n\r\n  61. For al-so seur as day cometh after night,\r\n  The newe love, labour or other wo,\r\n  Or elles selde seinge of a wight,\r\n  Don olde affecciouns alle over-go.\r\n  And, for thy part, thou shalt have oon of tho                         425\r\n  To abrigge with thy bittre peynes smerte;\r\n  Absence of hir shal dryve hir out of herte.'\r\n\r\n  62. Thise wordes seyde he for the nones alle,\r\n  To helpe his freend, lest he for sorwe deyde.\r\n  For doutelees, to doon his wo to falle,                               430\r\n  He roughte not what unthrift that he seyde.\r\n  But Troilus, that neigh for sorwe deyde,\r\n  Tok litel hede of al that ever he mente;\r\n  Oon ere it herde, at the other out it wente:--\r\n\r\n  63. But at the laste answerde and seyde, 'freend,                     435\r\n  This lechecraft, or heled thus to be,\r\n  Were wel sitting, if that I were a feend,\r\n  To traysen hir that trewe is unto me!\r\n  I pray god, lat this consayl never y-thee;\r\n  But do me rather sterve anon-right here                               440\r\n  Er I thus do as thou me woldest lere.\r\n\r\n  64. She that I serve, y-wis, what so thou seye,\r\n  To whom myn herte enhabit is by right,\r\n  Shal han me holly hires til that I deye.\r\n  For, Pandarus, sin I have trouthe hir hight,                          445\r\n  I wol not been untrewe for no wight;\r\n  But as hir man I wol ay live and sterve,\r\n  And never other creature serve.\r\n\r\n  65. And ther thou seyst, thou shall as faire finde\r\n  As she, lat be, make no comparisoun                                   450\r\n  To creature y-formed here by kinde.\r\n  O leve Pandare, in conclusioun,\r\n  I wol not be of thyn opinioun,\r\n  Touching al this; for whiche I thee biseche,\r\n  So hold thy pees; thou sleest me with thy speche.                     455\r\n\r\n  66. Thow biddest me I sholde love an-other\r\n  Al freshly newe, and lat Criseyde go!\r\n  It lyth not in my power, leve brother.\r\n  And though I mighte, I wolde not do so.\r\n  But canstow pleyen raket, to and fro,                                 460\r\n  Netle in, dokke out, now this, now that, Pandare?\r\n  Now foule falle hir, for thy wo that care!\r\n\r\n  67. Thow farest eek by me, thou Pandarus,\r\n  As he, that whan a wight is wo bi-goon,\r\n  He cometh to him a pas, and seyth right thus,                         465\r\n  \"Thenk not on smert, and thou shalt fele noon.\"\r\n  Thou most me first transmuwen in a stoon,\r\n  And reve me my passiounes alle,\r\n  Er thou so lightly do my wo to falle.\r\n\r\n  68. The deeth may wel out of my brest departe                         470\r\n  The lyf, so longe may this sorwe myne;\r\n  But fro my soule shal Criseydes darte\r\n  Out never-mo; but doun with Proserpyne,\r\n  Whan I am deed, I wol go wone in pyne;\r\n  And ther I wol eternally compleyne                                    475\r\n  My wo, and how that twinned be we tweyne.\r\n\r\n  69. Thow hast here maad an argument, for fyn,\r\n  How that it sholde lasse peyne be\r\n  Criseyde to for-goon, for she was myn,\r\n  And live in ese and in felicitee.                                     480\r\n  Why gabbestow, that seydest thus to me\r\n  That \"him is wors that is fro wele y-throwe,\r\n  Than he hadde erst non of that wele y-knowe?\"\r\n\r\n  70. But tel me now, sin that thee thinketh so light\r\n  To chaungen so in love, ay to and fro,                                485\r\n  Why hastow not don bisily thy might\r\n  To chaungen hir that doth thee al thy wo?\r\n  Why niltow lete hir fro thyn herte go?\r\n  Why niltow love an-other lady swete,\r\n  That may thyn herte setten in quiete?                                 490\r\n\r\n  71. If thou hast had in love ay yet mischaunce,\r\n  And canst it not out of thyn herte dryve,\r\n  I, that livede in lust and in plesaunce\r\n  With hir as muche as creature on-lyve,\r\n  How sholde I that foryete, and that so blyve?                         495\r\n  O where hastow ben hid so longe in muwe,\r\n  That canst so wel and formely arguwe?\r\n\r\n  72. Nay, nay, god wot, nought worth is al thy reed,\r\n  For which, for what that ever may bifalle,\r\n  With-outen wordes mo, I wol be deed.                                  500\r\n  O deeth, that endere art of sorwes alle,\r\n  Com now, sin I so ofte after thee calle,\r\n  For sely is that deeth, soth for to seyne,\r\n  That, ofte y-cleped, cometh and endeth peyne.\r\n\r\n  73. Wel wot I, whyl my lyf was in quiete,                             505\r\n  Er thou me slowe, I wolde have yeven hyre;\r\n  But now thy cominge is to me so swete,\r\n  That in this world I no-thing so desyre.\r\n  O deeth, sin with this sorwe I am a-fyre,\r\n  Thou outher do me anoon in teres drenche,                             510\r\n  Or with thy colde strook myn hete quenche!\r\n\r\n  74. Sin that thou sleest so fele in sondry wyse\r\n  Ayens hir wil, unpreyed, day and night,\r\n  Do me, at my requeste, this servyse,\r\n  Delivere now the world, so dostow right,                              515\r\n  Of me, that am the wofulleste wight\r\n  That ever was; for tyme is that I sterve,\r\n  Sin in this world of right nought may I serve.'\r\n\r\n  75. This Troilus in teres gan distille,\r\n  As licour out of alambyk ful faste;                                   520\r\n  And Pandarus gan holde his tunge stille,\r\n  And to the ground his eyen doun he caste.\r\n  But nathelees, thus thoughte he at the laste,\r\n  'What, parde, rather than my felawe deye,\r\n  Yet shal I som-what more un-to him seye:'                             525\r\n\r\n  76. And seyde, 'freend, sin thou hast swich distresse,\r\n  And sin thee list myn arguments to blame,\r\n  Why nilt thy-selven helpen doon redresse,\r\n  And with thy manhod letten al this grame?\r\n  Go ravisshe hir ne canstow not for shame!                             530\r\n  And outher lat hir out of toune fare,\r\n  Or hold hir stille, and leve thy nyce fare.\r\n\r\n  77. Artow in Troye, and hast non hardiment\r\n  To take a womman which that loveth thee,\r\n  And wolde hir-selven been of thyn assent?                             535\r\n  Now is not this a nyce vanitee?\r\n  Rys up anoon, and lat this weping be,\r\n  And kyth thou art a man, for in this houre\r\n  I wil be deed, or she shal bleven oure.'\r\n\r\n  78. To this answerde him Troilus ful softe,                           540\r\n  And seyde, 'parde, leve brother dere,\r\n  Al this have I my-self yet thought ful ofte,\r\n  And more thing than thou devysest here.\r\n  But why this thing is laft, thou shalt wel here;\r\n  And whan thou me hast yeve an audience,                               545\r\n  Ther-after mayst thou telle al thy sentence.\r\n\r\n  79. First, sin thou wost this toun hath al this werre\r\n  For ravisshing of wommen so by might,\r\n  It sholde not be suffred me to erre,\r\n  As it stant now, ne doon so gret unright.                             550\r\n  I sholde han also blame of every wight,\r\n  My fadres graunt if that I so withstode,\r\n  Sin she is chaunged for the tounes goode.\r\n\r\n  80. I have eek thought, so it were hir assent,\r\n  To aske hir at my fader, of his grace;                                555\r\n  Than thenke I, this were hir accusement,\r\n  Sin wel I woot I may hir not purchace.\r\n  For sin my fader, in so heigh a place\r\n  As parlement, hath hir eschaunge enseled,\r\n  He nil for me his lettre be repeled.                                  560\r\n\r\n  81. Yet drede I most hir herte to pertourbe\r\n  With violence, if I do swich a game;\r\n  For if I wolde it openly distourbe,\r\n  It moste been disclaundre to hir name.\r\n  And me were lever deed than hir defame,                               565\r\n  As nolde god but-if I sholde have\r\n  Hir honour lever than my lyf to save!\r\n\r\n  82. Thus am I lost, for ought that I can see;\r\n  For certeyn is, sin that I am hir knight,\r\n  I moste hir honour levere han than me                                 570\r\n  In every cas, as lovere oughte of right.\r\n  Thus am I with desyr and reson twight;\r\n  Desyr for to distourben hir me redeth,\r\n  And reson nil not, so myn herte dredeth.'\r\n\r\n  83. Thus wepinge that he coude never cesse,                           575\r\n  He seyde, 'allas! how shal I, wrecche, fare?\r\n  For wel fele I alwey my love encresse,\r\n  And hope is lasse and lasse alwey, Pandare!\r\n  Encressen eek the causes of my care;\r\n  So wel-a-wey, why nil myn herte breste?                               580\r\n  For, as in love, ther is but litel reste.'\r\n\r\n  84. Pandare answerde, 'freend, thou mayst, for me,\r\n  Don as thee list; but hadde ich it so hote,\r\n  And thyn estat, she sholde go with me;\r\n  Though al this toun cryede on this thing by note,                     585\r\n  I nolde sette at al that noyse a grote.\r\n  For when men han wel cryed, than wol they roune;\r\n  A wonder last but nyne night never in toune.\r\n\r\n  85. Devyne not in reson ay so depe\r\n  Ne curteysly, but help thy-self anoon;                                590\r\n  Bet is that othere than thy-selven wepe,\r\n  And namely, sin ye two been al oon.\r\n  Rys up, for by myn heed, she shal not goon;\r\n  And rather be in blame a lyte y-founde\r\n  Than sterve here as a gnat, with-oute wounde.                         595\r\n\r\n  86. It is no shame un-to yow, ne no vyce\r\n  Hir to with-holden, that ye loveth most.\r\n  Paraunter, she mighte holden thee for nyce\r\n  To lete hir go thus to the Grekes ost.\r\n  Thenk eek Fortune, as wel thy-selven wost,                            600\r\n  Helpeth hardy man to his empryse,\r\n  And weyveth wrecches, for hir cowardyse.\r\n\r\n  87. And though thy lady wolde a litel hir greve,\r\n  Thou shalt thy pees ful wel here-after make,\r\n  But as for me, certayn, I can not leve                                605\r\n  That she wolde it as now for yvel take.\r\n  Why sholde than for ferd thyn herte quake?\r\n  Thenk eek how Paris hath, that is thy brother,\r\n  A love; and why shaltow not have another?\r\n\r\n  88. And Troilus, o thing I dar thee swere,                            610\r\n  That if Criseyde, whiche that is thy leef,\r\n  Now loveth thee as wel as thou dost here,\r\n  God helpe me so, she nil not take a-greef,\r\n  Though thou do bote a-noon in this mischeef.\r\n  And if she wilneth fro thee for to passe,                             615\r\n  Thanne is she fals; so love hir wel the lasse.\r\n\r\n  89. For-thy tak herte, and thenk, right as a knight,\r\n  Thourgh love is broken alday every lawe.\r\n  Kyth now sumwhat thy corage and thy might,\r\n  Have mercy on thy-self, for any awe.                                  620\r\n  Lat not this wrecched wo thin herte gnawe,\r\n  But manly set the world on sixe and sevene;\r\n  And, if thou deye a martir, go to hevene.\r\n\r\n  90. I wol my-self be with thee at this dede,\r\n  Though ich and al my kin, up-on a stounde,                            625\r\n  Shulle in a strete as dogges liggen dede,\r\n  Thourgh-girt with many a wyd and blody wounde.\r\n  In every cas I wol a freend be founde.\r\n  And if thee list here sterven as a wrecche,\r\n  A-dieu, the devel spede him that it recche!'                          630\r\n\r\n  91. This Troilus gan with tho wordes quiken,\r\n  And seyde, 'freend, graunt mercy, ich assente;\r\n  But certaynly thou mayst not me so priken,\r\n  Ne peyne noon ne may me so tormente,\r\n  That, for no cas, it is not myn entente,                              635\r\n  At shorte wordes, though I dyen sholde,\r\n  To ravisshe hir, but-if hir-self it wolde.'\r\n\r\n  92. 'Why, so mene I,' quod Pandarus, 'al this day.\r\n  But tel me than, hastow hir wel assayed,\r\n  That sorwest thus?' And he answerde, 'nay.'                           640\r\n  'Wher-of artow,' quod Pandare, 'than a-mayed,\r\n  That nost not that she wol ben yvel apayed\r\n  To ravisshe hir, sin thou hast not ben there,\r\n  But-if that Iove tolde it in thyn ere?\r\n\r\n  93. For-thy rys up, as nought ne were, anoon,                         645\r\n  And wash thy face, and to the king thou wende,\r\n  Or he may wondren whider thou art goon.\r\n  Thou most with wisdom him and othere blende;\r\n  Or, up-on cas, he may after thee sende\r\n  Er thou be war; and shortly, brother dere,                            650\r\n  Be glad, and lat me werke in this matere.\r\n\r\n  94. For I shal shape it so, that sikerly\r\n  Thou shalt this night som tyme, in som manere,\r\n  Com speke with thy lady prevely,\r\n  And by hir wordes eek, and by hir chere,                              655\r\n  Thou shalt ful sone aparceyve and wel here\r\n  Al hir entente, and in this cas the beste;\r\n  And fare now wel, for in this point I reste.'\r\n\r\n  95. The swifte Fame, whiche that false thinges\r\n  Egal reporteth lyk the thinges trewe,                                 660\r\n  Was thorugh-out Troye y-fled with preste winges\r\n  Fro man to man, and made this tale al newe,\r\n  How Calkas doughter, with hir brighte hewe,\r\n  At parlement, with-oute wordes more,\r\n  I-graunted was in chaunge of Antenore.                                665\r\n\r\n  96. The whiche tale anoon-right as Criseyde\r\n  Had herd, she which that of hir fader roughte,\r\n  As in this cas, right nought, ne whanne he deyde,\r\n  Ful bisily to Iuppiter bisoughte\r\n  Yeve him mischaunce that this tretis broughte.                        670\r\n  But shortly, lest thise tales sothe were,\r\n  She dorste at no wight asken it, for fere.\r\n\r\n  97. As she that hadde hir herte and al hir minde\r\n  On Troilus y-set so wonder faste,\r\n  That al this world ne mighte hir love unbinde,                        675\r\n  Ne Troilus out of hir herte caste;\r\n  She wol ben his, whyl that hir lyf may laste.\r\n  And thus she brenneth bothe in love and drede,\r\n  So that she niste what was best to rede.\r\n\r\n  98. But as men seen in toune, and al aboute,                          680\r\n  That wommen usen frendes to visyte,\r\n  So to Criseyde of wommen com a route\r\n  For pitous Ioye, and wenden hir delyte;\r\n  And with hir tales, dere y-nough a myte,\r\n  These wommen, whiche that in the cite dwelle,                         685\r\n  They sette hem doun, and seyde as I shal telle.\r\n\r\n  99. Quod first that oon, 'I am glad, trewely,\r\n  By-cause of yow, that shal your fader see.'\r\n  A-nother seyde, 'y-wis, so nam not I;\r\n  For al to litel hath she with us be.'                                 690\r\n  Quod tho the thridde, 'I hope, y-wis, that she\r\n  Shal bringen us the pees on every syde,\r\n  That, whan she gooth, almighty god hir gyde!'\r\n\r\n  100. Tho wordes and tho wommannisshe thinges,\r\n  She herde hem right as though she thennes were;                       695\r\n  For, god it wot, hir herte on other thing is,\r\n  Although the body sat among hem there.\r\n  Hir advertence is alwey elles-where;\r\n  For Troilus ful faste hir soule soughte;\r\n  With-outen word, alwey on him she thoughte.                           700\r\n\r\n  101. Thise wommen, that thus wenden hir to plese,\r\n  Aboute nought gonne alle hir tales spende;\r\n  Swich vanitee ne can don hir non ese,\r\n  As she that, al this mene whyle, brende\r\n  Of other passioun than that they wende,                               705\r\n  So that she felte almost hir herte deye\r\n  For wo, and wery of that companye.\r\n\r\n  102. For which no lenger mighte she restreyne\r\n  Hir teres, so they gonnen up to welle,\r\n  That yeven signes of the bitter peyne                                 710\r\n  In whiche hir spirit was, and moste dwelle;\r\n  Remembring hir, fro heven unto which helle\r\n  She fallen was, sith she forgoth the sighte\r\n  Of Troilus, and sorowfully she sighte.\r\n\r\n  103. And thilke foles sittinge hir aboute                             715\r\n  Wenden, that she wepte and syked sore\r\n  By-cause that she sholde out of that route\r\n  Departe, and never pleye with hem more.\r\n  And they that hadde y-knowen hir of yore\r\n  Seye hir so wepe, and thoughte it kindenesse,                         720\r\n  And eche of hem wepte eek for hir distresse;\r\n\r\n  104. And bisily they gonnen hir conforten\r\n  Of thing, god wot, on which she litel thoughte;\r\n  And with hir tales wenden hir disporten,\r\n  And to be glad they often hir bisoughte.                              725\r\n  But swich an ese ther-with they hir wroughte\r\n  Right as a man is esed for to fele,\r\n  For ache of heed, to clawen him on his hele!\r\n\r\n  105. But after al this nyce vanitee\r\n  They took hir leve, and hoom they wenten alle.                        730\r\n  Criseyde, ful of sorweful pitee,\r\n  In-to hir chaumbre up wente out of the halle,\r\n  And on hir bed she gan for deed to falle,\r\n  In purpos never thennes for to ryse;\r\n  And thus she wroughte, as I shal yow devyse.                          735\r\n\r\n  106. Hir ounded heer, that sonnish was of hewe,\r\n  She rente, and eek hir fingres longe and smale\r\n  She wrong ful ofte, and bad god on hir rewe,\r\n  And with the deeth to doon bote on hir bale.\r\n  Hir hewe, whylom bright, that tho was pale,                           740\r\n  Bar witnes of hir wo and hir constreynte;\r\n  And thus she spak, sobbinge, in hir compleynte:\r\n\r\n  107. 'Alas!' quod she, 'out of this regioun\r\n  I, woful wrecche and infortuned wight,\r\n  And born in corsed constellacioun,                                    745\r\n  Mot goon, and thus departen fro my knight;\r\n  Wo worth, allas! that ilke dayes light\r\n  On which I saw him first with eyen tweyne,\r\n  That causeth me, and I him, al this peyne!'\r\n\r\n  108. Therwith the teres from hir eyen two                             750\r\n  Doun fille, as shour in Aperill, ful swythe;\r\n  Hir whyte brest she bet, and for the wo\r\n  After the deeth she cryed a thousand sythe,\r\n  Sin he that wont hir wo was for to lythe,\r\n  She mot for-goon; for which disaventure                               755\r\n  She held hir-self a forlost creature.\r\n\r\n  109. She seyde, 'how shal he doon, and I also?\r\n  How sholde I live, if that I from him twinne?\r\n  O dere herte eek, that I love so,\r\n  Who shal that sorwe sleen that ye ben inne?                           760\r\n  O Calkas, fader, thyn be al this sinne!\r\n  O moder myn, that cleped were Argyve,\r\n  Wo worth that day that thou me bere on lyve!\r\n\r\n  110. To what fyn sholde I live and sorwen thus?\r\n  How sholde a fish with-oute water dure?                               765\r\n  What is Criseyde worth, from Troilus?\r\n  How sholde a plaunte or lyves creature\r\n  Live, with-oute his kinde noriture?\r\n  For which ful oft a by-word here I seye,\r\n  That, \"rotelees, mot grene sone deye.\"                                770\r\n\r\n  111. I shal don thus, sin neither swerd ne darte\r\n  Dar I non handle, for the crueltee,\r\n  That ilke day that I from yow departe,\r\n  If sorwe of that nil not my bane be,\r\n  Than shal no mete or drinke come in me                                775\r\n  Til I my soule out of my breste unshethe;\r\n  And thus my-selven wol I do to dethe.\r\n\r\n  112. And, Troilus, my clothes everichoon\r\n  Shul blake been, in tokeninge, herte swete,\r\n  That I am as out of this world agoon,                                 780\r\n  That wont was yow to setten in quiete;\r\n  And of myn ordre, ay til deeth me mete,\r\n  The observaunce ever, in your absence,\r\n  Shal sorwe been, compleynte, and abstinence.\r\n\r\n  113.

Thus herte myn, for Antenor, allas!\r\n  I sone shal be chaunged, as I wene.\r\n  But how shul ye don in this sorwful cas,\r\n  How shal your tendre herte this sustene?                              795\r\n  But herte myn, for-yet this sorwe and tene,\r\n  And me also; for, soothly for to seye,\r\n  So ye wel fare, I recche not to deye.'\r\n\r\n  115. How mighte it ever y-red ben or y-songe,\r\n  The pleynte that she made in hir distresse?                           800\r\n  I noot; but, as for me, my litel tonge,\r\n  If I discreven wolde hir hevinesse,\r\n  It sholde make hir sorwe seme lesse\r\n  Than that it was, and childishly deface\r\n  Hir heigh compleynte, and therfore I it pace.                         805\r\n\r\n  116. Pandare, which that sent from Troilus\r\n  Was to Criseyde, as ye han herd devyse,\r\n  That for the beste it was accorded thus,\r\n  And he ful glad to doon him that servyse,\r\n  Un-to Criseyde, in a ful secree wyse,                                 810\r\n  Ther-as she lay in torment and in rage,\r\n  Com hir to telle al hoolly his message.\r\n\r\n  117. And fond that she hir-selven gan to trete\r\n  Ful pitously; for with hir salte teres\r\n  Hir brest, hir face y-bathed was ful wete;                            815\r\n  The mighty tresses of hir sonnish heres,\r\n  Unbroyden, hangen al aboute hir eres;\r\n  Which yaf him verray signal of martyre\r\n  Of deeth, which that hir herte gan desyre.\r\n\r\n  118.

She was right swich to seen in hir visage\r\n  As is that wight that men on bere binde;\r\n  Hir face, lyk of Paradys the image,\r\n  Was al y-chaunged in another kinde.                                   865\r\n  The pleye, the laughtre men was wont to finde\r\n  In hir, and eek hir Ioyes everychone,\r\n  Ben fled, and thus lyth now Criseyde allone.\r\n\r\n  125. Aboute hir eyen two a purpre ring\r\n  Bi-trent, in sothfast tokninge of hir peyne,                          870\r\n  That to biholde it was a dedly thing,\r\n  For which Pandare mighte not restreyne\r\n  The teres from his eyen for to reyne.\r\n  But nathelees, as he best mighte, he seyde\r\n  From Troilus thise wordes to Criseyde.                                875\r\n\r\n  126. 'Lo, nece, I trowe ye han herd al how\r\n  The king, with othere lordes, for the beste,\r\n  Hath mad eschaunge of Antenor and yow,\r\n  That cause is of this sorwe and this unreste.\r\n  But how this cas doth Troilus moleste,                                880\r\n  That may non erthely mannes tonge seye;\r\n  For verray wo his wit is al aweye.\r\n\r\n  127. For which we han so sorwed, he and I,\r\n  That in-to litel bothe it hadde us slawe;\r\n  But thurgh my conseil this day, fynally,                              885\r\n  He somwhat is fro weping now with-drawe.\r\n  And semeth me that he desyreth fawe\r\n  With yow to been al night, for to devyse\r\n  Remede in this, if ther were any wyse.\r\n\r\n  128. This, short and pleyne, theffect of my message,                  890\r\n  As ferforth as my wit can comprehende.\r\n  For ye, that been of torment in swich rage,\r\n  May to no long prologe as now entende;\r\n  And her-upon ye may answere him sende.\r\n  And, for the love of god, my nece dere,                               895\r\n  So leef this wo er Troilus be here.'\r\n\r\n  129. 'Gret is my wo,' quod she, and sighte sore,\r\n  As she that feleth dedly sharp distresse;\r\n  'But yet to me his sorwe is muchel more,\r\n  That love him bet than he him-self, I gesse.                          900\r\n  Allas! for me hath he swich hevinesse?\r\n  Can he for me so pitously compleyne?\r\n  Y-wis, this sorwe doubleth al my peyne.\r\n\r\n  130. Grevous to me, god wot, is for to twinne,'\r\n  Quod she, 'but yet it hardere is to me                                905\r\n  To seen that sorwe which that he is inne;\r\n  For wel wot I, it wol my bane be;\r\n  And deye I wol in certayn,' tho quod she;\r\n  'But bidde him come, er deeth, that thus me threteth,\r\n  Dryve out that goost, which in myn herte beteth.'                     910\r\n\r\n  131. Thise wordes seyd, she on hir armes two\r\n  Fil gruf, and gan to wepe pitously.\r\n  Quod Pandarus, 'allas! why do ye so,\r\n  Syn wel ye wot the tyme is faste by,\r\n  That he shal come? Arys up hastely,                                   915\r\n  That he yow nat biwopen thus ne finde,\r\n  But ye wol han him wood out of his minde!\r\n\r\n  132. For wiste he that ye ferde in this manere,\r\n  He wolde him-selve slee; and if I wende\r\n  To han this fare, he sholde not come here                             920\r\n  For al the good that Pryam may despende.\r\n  For to what fyn he wolde anoon pretende,\r\n  That knowe I wel; and for-thy yet I seye,\r\n  So leef this sorwe, or platly he wol deye.\r\n\r\n  133. And shapeth yow his sorwe for to abregge,                        925\r\n  And nought encresse, leve nece swete;\r\n  Beth rather to him cause of flat than egge,\r\n  And with som wysdom ye his sorwes bete.\r\n  What helpeth it to wepen ful a strete,\r\n  Or though ye bothe in salte teres dreynte?                            930\r\n  Bet is a tyme of cure ay than of pleynte.\r\n\r\n  134. I mene thus; whan I him hider bringe,\r\n  Sin ye ben wyse, and bothe of oon assent,\r\n  So shapeth how distourbe your goinge,\r\n  Or come ayen, sone after ye be went.                                  935\r\n  Wommen ben wyse in short avysement;\r\n  And lat sen how your wit shal now avayle;\r\n  And what that I may helpe, it shal not fayle.'\r\n\r\n  135. 'Go,' quod Criseyde, 'and uncle, trewely,\r\n  I shal don al my might, me to restreyne                               940\r\n  From weping in his sight, and bisily,\r\n  Him for to glade, I shal don al my peyne,\r\n  And in myn herte seken every veyne;\r\n  If to this soor ther may be founden salve,\r\n  It shal not lakken, certain, on myn halve.'                           945\r\n\r\n  136. Goth Pandarus, and Troilus he soughte,\r\n  Til in a temple he fond him allone,\r\n  As he that of his lyf no lenger roughte;\r\n  But to the pitouse goddes everichone\r\n  Ful tendrely he preyde, and made his mone,                            950\r\n  To doon him sone out of this world to pace;\r\n  For wel he thoughte ther was non other grace.\r\n\r\n  137. And shortly, al the sothe for to seye,\r\n  He was so fallen in despeyr that day,\r\n  That outrely he shoop him for to deye.                                955\r\n  For right thus was his argument alwey:\r\n  He seyde, he nas but loren, waylawey!\r\n  'For al that comth, comth by necessitee;\r\n  Thus to be lorn, it is my destinee.\r\n\r\n  138. For certaynly, this wot I wel,' he seyde,                        960\r\n  That for-sight of divyne purveyaunce\r\n  Hath seyn alwey me to for-gon Criseyde,\r\n  Sin god seeth every thing, out of doutaunce,\r\n  And hem desponeth, thourgh his ordenaunce,\r\n  In hir merytes sothly for to be,                                      965\r\n  As they shul comen by predestinee.\r\n\r\n  139. But nathelees, allas! whom shal I leve?\r\n  For ther ben grete clerkes many oon,\r\n  That destinee thorugh argumentes preve;\r\n  And som men seyn that nedely ther is noon;                            970\r\n  But that free chois is yeven us everichoon.\r\n  O, welaway! so sleye arn clerkes olde,\r\n  That I not whos opinion I may holde.\r\n\r\n  140. For som men seyn, if god seth al biforn,\r\n  Ne god may not deceyved ben, pardee,                                  975\r\n  Than moot it fallen, though men hadde it sworn,\r\n  That purveyaunce hath seyn bifore to be.\r\n  Wherfor I seye, that from eterne if he\r\n  Hath wist biforn our thought eek as our dede,\r\n  We have no free chois, as these clerkes rede.                         980\r\n\r\n  141. For other thought nor other dede also\r\n  Might never be, but swich as purveyaunce,\r\n  Which may not ben deceyved never-mo,\r\n  Hath feled biforn, with-outen ignoraunce.\r\n  For if ther mighte been a variaunce                                   985\r\n  To wrythen out fro goddes purveyinge,\r\n  Ther nere no prescience of thing cominge;\r\n\r\n  142. But it were rather an opinioun\r\n  Uncerteyn, and no stedfast forseinge;\r\n  And certes, that were an abusioun,                                    990\r\n  That god shuld han no parfit cleer witinge\r\n  More than we men that han doutous weninge.\r\n  But swich an errour up-on god to gesse\r\n  Were fals and foul, and wikked corsednesse.\r\n\r\n  143. Eek this is an opinioun of somme                                 995\r\n  That han hir top ful heighe and smothe y-shore;\r\n  They seyn right thus, that thing is not to come\r\n  For that the prescience hath seyn bifore\r\n  That it shal come; but they seyn, that therfore\r\n  That it shal come, therfore the purveyaunce                          1000\r\n  Wot it biforn with-outen ignoraunce;\r\n\r\n  144. And in this manere this necessitee\r\n  Retorneth in his part contrarie agayn.\r\n  For needfully bihoveth it not to be\r\n  That thilke thinges fallen in certayn                                1005\r\n  That ben purveyed; but nedely, as they seyn,\r\n  Bihoveth it that thinges, whiche that falle,\r\n  That they in certayn ben purveyed alle.\r\n\r\n  145. I mene as though I laboured me in this,\r\n  To enqueren which thing cause of which thing be;                     1010\r\n  As whether that the prescience of god is\r\n  The certayn cause of the necessitee\r\n  Of thinges that to comen been, pardee;\r\n  Or if necessitee of thing cominge\r\n  Be cause certeyn of the purveyinge.                                  1015\r\n\r\n  146. But now ne enforce I me nat in shewinge\r\n  How the ordre of causes stant; but wel wot I,\r\n  That it bihoveth that the bifallinge\r\n  Of thinges wist biforen certeynly\r\n  Be necessarie, al seme it not ther-by                                1020\r\n  That prescience put falling necessaire\r\n  To thing to come, al falle it foule or faire.\r\n\r\n  147. For if ther sit a man yond on a see,\r\n  Than by necessitee bihoveth it\r\n  That, certes, thyn opinioun soth be,                                 1025\r\n  That wenest or coniectest that he sit;\r\n  And ferther-over now ayenward yit,\r\n  Lo, right so it is of the part contrarie,\r\n  As thus; (now herkne, for I wol not tarie):\r\n\r\n  148. I seye, that if the opinioun of thee                            1030\r\n  Be sooth, for that he sit, than seye I this,\r\n  That he mot sitten by necessitee;\r\n  And thus necessitee in either is.\r\n  For in him nede of sitting is, y-wis,\r\n  And in thee nede of sooth; and thus, forsothe,                       1035\r\n  Ther moot necessitee ben in yow bothe.\r\n\r\n  149. But thou mayst seyn, the man sit not therfore,\r\n  That thyn opinion of sitting soth is;\r\n  But rather, for the man sit ther bifore,\r\n  Therfore is thyn opinion sooth, y-wis.                               1040\r\n  And I seye, though the cause of sooth of this\r\n  Comth of his sitting, yet necessitee\r\n  Is entrechaunged, bothe in him and thee.\r\n\r\n  150. Thus on this same wyse, out of doutaunce,\r\n  I may wel maken, as it semeth me,                                    1045\r\n  My resoninge of goddes purveyaunce,\r\n  And of the thinges that to comen be;\r\n  By whiche reson men may wel y-see,\r\n  That thilke thinges that in erthe falle,\r\n  That by necessitee they comen alle.                                  1050\r\n\r\n  151. For al-though that, for thing shal come, y-wis,\r\n  Therfore is it purveyed, certaynly,\r\n  Nat that it comth for it purveyed is:\r\n  Yet nathelees, bihoveth it nedfully,\r\n  That thing to come be purveyed, trewely;                             1055\r\n  Or elles, thinges that purveyed be,\r\n  That they bityden by necessitee.\r\n\r\n  152. And this suffyseth right y-now, certeyn,\r\n  For to destroye our free chois every del.--\r\n  But now is this abusion to seyn,                                     1060\r\n  That fallinge of the thinges temporel\r\n  Is cause of goddes prescience eternel.\r\n  Now trewely, that is a fals sentence,\r\n  That thing to come sholde cause his prescience.\r\n\r\n  153. What mighte I wene, and I hadde swich a thought,                1065\r\n  But that god purveyth thing that is to come\r\n  For that it is to come, and elles nought?\r\n  So mighte I wene that thinges alle and some,\r\n  That whylom been bifalle and over-come,\r\n  Ben cause of thilke sovereyn purveyaunce,                            1070\r\n  That for-wot al with-outen ignoraunce.\r\n\r\n  154. And over al this, yet seye I more herto,\r\n  That right as whan I woot ther is a thing,\r\n  Y-wis, that thing mot nedefully be so;\r\n  Eek right so, whan I woot a thing coming,                            1075\r\n  So mot it come; and thus the bifalling\r\n  Of thinges that ben wist bifore the tyde,\r\n  They mowe not been eschewed on no syde.'\r\n\r\n  155. Than seyde he thus, 'almighty Iove in trone,\r\n  That wost of al this thing the soothfastnesse,                       1080\r\n  Rewe on my sorwe, or do me deye sone,\r\n  Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.'\r\n  And whyl he was in al this hevinesse,\r\n  Disputinge with him-self in this matere,\r\n  Com Pandare in, and seyde as ye may here.                            1085\r\n\r\n  156. 'O mighty god,' quod Pandarus, 'in trone,\r\n  Ey! who seigh ever a wys man faren so?\r\n  Why, Troilus, what thenkestow to done?\r\n  Hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo?\r\n  What, parde, yet is not Criseyde a-go!                               1090\r\n  Why lust thee so thy-self for-doon for drede,\r\n  That in thyn heed thyn eyen semen dede?\r\n\r\n  157. Hastow not lived many a yeer biforn\r\n  With-outen hir, and ferd ful wel at ese?\r\n  Artow for hir and for non other born?                                1095\r\n  Hath kinde thee wroughte al-only hir to plese?\r\n  Lat be, and thenk right thus in thy disese.\r\n  That, in the dees right as ther fallen chaunces,\r\n  Right so in love, ther come and goon plesaunces.\r\n\r\n  158. And yet this is a wonder most of alle,                          1100\r\n  Why thou thus sorwest, sin thou nost not yit,\r\n  Touching hir goinge, how that it shal falle,\r\n  Ne if she can hir-self distorben it.\r\n  Thou hast not yet assayed al hir wit.\r\n  A man may al by tyme his nekke bede                                  1105\r\n  Whan it shal of, and sorwen at the nede.\r\n\r\n  159. For-thy take hede of that that I shal seye;\r\n  I have with hir y-spoke and longe y-be,\r\n  So as accorded was bitwixe us tweye.\r\n  And ever-mo me thinketh thus, that she                               1110\r\n  Hath som-what in hir hertes prevetee,\r\n  Wher-with she can, if I shal right arede,\r\n  Distorbe al this, of which thou art in drede.\r\n\r\n  160. For which my counseil is, whan it is night,\r\n  Thou to hir go, and make of this an ende;                            1115\r\n  And blisful Iuno, thourgh hir grete mighte,\r\n  Shal, as I hope, hir grace un-to us sende.\r\n  Myn herte seyth, \"certeyn, she shal not wende;\"\r\n  And for-thy put thyn herte a whyle in reste;\r\n  And hold this purpos, for it is the beste.'                          1120\r\n\r\n  161. This Troilus answerde, and sighte sore,\r\n  'Thou seyst right wel, and I wil do right so;'\r\n  And what him liste, he seyde un-to it more.\r\n  And whan that it was tyme for to go,\r\n  Ful prevely him-self, with-outen mo,                                 1125\r\n  Un-to hir com, as he was wont to done;\r\n  And how they wroughte, I shal yow telle sone.\r\n\r\n  162. Soth is, that whan they gonne first to mete,\r\n  So gan the peyne hir hertes for to twiste,\r\n  That neither of hem other mighte grete,                              1130\r\n  But hem in armes toke and after kiste.\r\n  The lasse wofulle of hem bothe niste\r\n  Wher that he was, ne mighte o word out-bringe,\r\n  As I seyde erst, for wo and for sobbinge.\r\n\r\n  163. Tho woful teres that they leten falle                           1135\r\n  As bittre weren, out of teres kinde,\r\n  For peyne, as is ligne aloës or galle.\r\n  So bittre teres weep nought, as I finde,\r\n  The woful Myrra through the bark and rinde.\r\n  That in this world ther nis so hard an herte,                        1140\r\n  That nolde han rewed on hir peynes smerte.\r\n\r\n  164. But whan hir woful wery gostes tweyne\r\n  Retorned been ther-as hem oughte dwelle,\r\n  And that som-what to wayken gan the peyne\r\n  By lengthe of pleynte, and ebben gan the welle                       1145\r\n  Of hire teres, and the herte unswelle,\r\n  With broken voys, al hoors for-shright, Criseyde\r\n  To Troilus thise ilke wordes seyde:\r\n\r\n  165. 'O Iove, I deye, and mercy I beseche!\r\n  Help, Troilus!' and ther-with-al hir face                            1150\r\n  Upon his brest she leyde, and loste speche;\r\n  Hir woful spirit from his propre place,\r\n  Right with the word, alwey up poynt to pace.\r\n  And thus she lyth with hewes pale and grene,\r\n  That whylom fresh and fairest was to sene.                           1155\r\n\r\n  166. This Troilus, that on hir gan biholde,\r\n  Clepinge hir name, (and she lay as for deed,\r\n  With-oute answere, and felte hir limes colde,\r\n  Hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed),\r\n  This sorwful man can now noon other reed,                            1160\r\n  But ofte tyme hir colde mouth he kiste;\r\n  Wher him was wo, god and him-self it wiste!\r\n\r\n  167. He rist him up, and long streight he hir leyde;\r\n  For signe of lyf, for ought he can or may,\r\n  Can he noon finde in no-thing on Criseyde,                           1165\r\n  For which his song ful ofte is 'weylaway!'\r\n  But whan he saugh that specheles she lay,\r\n  With sorwful voys, and herte of blisse al bare,\r\n  He seyde how she was fro this world y-fare!\r\n\r\n  168. So after that he longe hadde hir compleyned,                    1170\r\n  His hondes wrong, and seyde that was to seye,\r\n  And with his teres salte hir brest bireyned,\r\n  He gan tho teris wypen of ful dreye,\r\n  And pitously gan for the soule preye,\r\n  And seyde, 'O lord, that set art in thy trone,                       1175\r\n  Rewe eek on me, for I shal folwe hir sone!'\r\n\r\n  169. She cold was and with-outen sentement,\r\n  For aught he woot, for breeth ne felte he noon;\r\n  And this was him a preignant argument\r\n  That she was forth out of this world agoon;                          1180\r\n  And whan he seigh ther was non other woon,\r\n  He gan hir limes dresse in swich manere\r\n  As men don hem that shul be leyd on bere.\r\n\r\n  170. And after this, with sterne and cruel herte,\r\n  His swerd a-noon out of his shethe he twighte,                       1185\r\n  Him-self to sleen, how sore that him smerte,\r\n  So that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte,\r\n  Ther-as the doom of Mynos wolde it dighte;\r\n  Sin love and cruel Fortune it ne wolde,\r\n  That in this world he lenger liven sholde.                           1190\r\n\r\n  171. Thanne seyde he thus, fulfild of heigh desdayn,\r\n  'O cruel Iove, and thou, Fortune adverse,\r\n  This al and som, that falsly have ye slayn\r\n  Criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse,\r\n  Fy on your might and werkes so diverse!                              1195\r\n  Thus cowardly ye shul me never winne;\r\n  Ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne.\r\n\r\n  172. For I this world, sin ye han slayn hir thus,\r\n  Wol lete, and folowe hir spirit lowe or hye;\r\n  Shal never lover seyn that Troilus                                   1200\r\n  Dar not, for fere, with his lady dye;\r\n  For certeyn, I wol bere hir companye.\r\n  But sin ye wol not suffre us liven here,\r\n  Yet suffreth that our soules ben y-fere.\r\n\r\n  173. And thou, citee, whiche that I leve in wo,                      1205\r\n  And thou, Pryam, and bretheren al y-fere,\r\n  And thou, my moder, farewel! for I go;\r\n  And Attropos, make redy thou my bere!\r\n  And thou, Criseyde, o swete herte dere,\r\n  Receyve now my spirit!' wolde he seye,                               1210\r\n  With swerd at herte, al redy for to deye.\r\n\r\n  174. But as god wolde, of swough ther-with she abreyde,\r\n  And gan to syke, and 'Troilus' she cryde;\r\n  And he answerde, 'lady myn Criseyde,\r\n  Live ye yet?' and leet his swerd doun glyde.                         1215\r\n  'Ye, herte myn, that thanked be Cupyde!'\r\n  Quod she, and ther-with-al she sore sighte;\r\n  And he bigan to glade hir as he mighte;\r\n\r\n  175. Took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte,\r\n  And hir to glade he dide al his entente;                             1220\r\n  For which hir goost, that flikered ay on-lofte,\r\n  In-to hir woful herte ayein it wente.\r\n  But at the laste, as that hir eyen glente\r\n  A-syde, anoon she gan his swerd aspye,\r\n  As it lay bare, and gan for fere crye,                               1225\r\n\r\n  176. And asked him, why he it hadde out-drawe?\r\n  And Troilus anoon the cause hir tolde,\r\n  And how himself ther-with he wolde have slawe.\r\n  For which Criseyde up-on him gan biholde,\r\n  And gan him in hir armes faste folde,                                1230\r\n  And seyde, 'O mercy, god, lo, which a dede!\r\n  Allas! how neigh we were bothe dede!\r\n\r\n  177. Thanne if I ne hadde spoken, as grace was,\r\n  Ye wolde han slayn your-self anoon?' quod she.\r\n  'Ye, douteless;' and she answerde, 'allas!                           1235\r\n  For, by that ilke lord that made me,\r\n  I nolde a forlong wey on-lyve han be,\r\n  After your deeth, to han be crowned quene\r\n  Of al the lond the sonne on shyneth shene.\r\n\r\n  178. But with this selve swerd, which that here is,                  1240\r\n  My-selve I wolde have slayn!'--quod she tho;\r\n  'But ho, for we han right y-now of this,\r\n  And late us ryse and streight to bedde go;\r\n  And therë lat vs speken of our wo.\r\n  For, by the morter which that I see brenne,                          1245\r\n  Knowe I ful wel that day is not fer henne.'\r\n\r\n  179. Whan they were in hir bedde, in armes folde,\r\n  Nought was it lyk tho nightes here-biforn;\r\n  For pitously ech other gan biholde,\r\n  As they that hadden al hir blisse y-lorn,                            1250\r\n  Biwaylinge ay the day that they were born.\r\n  Til at the last this sorwful wight Criseyde\r\n  To Troilus these ilke wordes seyde:--\r\n\r\n  180. 'Lo, herte myn, wel wot ye this,' quod she,\r\n  'That if a wight alwey his wo compleyne,                             1255\r\n  And seketh nought how holpen for to be,\r\n  It nis but folye and encrees of peyne;\r\n  And sin that here assembled be we tweyne\r\n  To finde bote of wo that we ben inne,\r\n  It were al tyme sone to biginne.                                     1260\r\n\r\n  181. I am a womman, as ful wel ye woot,\r\n  And as I am avysed sodeynly,\r\n  So wol I telle yow, whyl it is hoot.\r\n  Me thinketh thus, that neither ye nor I\r\n  Oughte half this wo to make skilfully.                               1265\r\n  For there is art y-now for to redresse\r\n  That yet is mis, and sleen this hevinesse.\r\n\r\n  182. Sooth is, the wo, the whiche that we ben inne,\r\n  For ought I woot, for no-thing elles is\r\n  But for the cause that we sholden twinne.                            1270\r\n  Considered al, ther nis no-more amis.\r\n  But what is thanne a remede un-to this,\r\n  But that we shape us sone for to mete?\r\n  This al and som, my dere herte swete.\r\n\r\n  183. Now that I shal wel bringen it aboute                           1275\r\n  To come ayein, sone after that I go,\r\n  Ther-of am I no maner thing in doute.\r\n  For dredeles, with-inne a wouke or two,\r\n  I shal ben here; and, that it may be so\r\n  By alle right, and in a wordes fewe,                                 1280\r\n  I shal yow wel an heep of weyes shewe.\r\n\r\n  184. For which I wol not make long sermoun,\r\n  For tyme y-lost may not recovered be;\r\n  But I wol gon to my conclusioun,\r\n  And to the beste, in ought that I can see.                           1285\r\n  And, for the love of god, for-yeve it me\r\n  If I speke ought ayein your hertes reste;\r\n  For trewely, I speke it for the beste;\r\n\r\n  185. Makinge alwey a protestacioun,\r\n  That now these wordes, whiche that I shal seye,                      1290\r\n  Nis but to shewe yow my mocioun,\r\n  To finde un-to our helpe the beste weye;\r\n  And taketh it non other wyse, I preye.\r\n  For in effect what-so ye me comaunde,\r\n  That wol I doon, for that is no demaunde.                            1295\r\n\r\n  186. Now herkeneth this, ye han wel understonde,\r\n  My goinge graunted is by parlement\r\n  So ferforth, that it may not be with-stonde\r\n  For al this world, as by my Iugement.\r\n  And sin ther helpeth noon avysement                                  1300\r\n  To letten it, lat it passe out of minde;\r\n  And lat us shape a bettre wey to finde.\r\n\r\n  187. The sothe is, that the twinninge of us tweyne\r\n  Wol us disese and cruelliche anoye.\r\n  But him bihoveth som-tyme han a peyne,                               1305\r\n  That serveth love, if that he wol have Ioye.\r\n  And sin I shal no ferthere out of Troye\r\n  Than I may ryde ayein on half a morwe,\r\n  It oughte lasse causen us to sorwe.\r\n\r\n  188. So as I shal not so ben hid in muwe,                            1310\r\n  That day by day, myn owene herte dere,\r\n  Sin wel ye woot that it is now a truwe,\r\n  Ye shul ful wel al myn estat y-here.\r\n  And er that truwe is doon, I shal ben here,\r\n  And thanne have ye bothe Antenor y-wonne                             1315\r\n  And me also; beth glad now, if ye conne;\r\n\r\n  189. And thenk right thus, \"Criseyde is now agoon,\r\n  But what! she shal come hastely ayeyn;\"\r\n  And whanne, allas? by god, lo, right anoon,\r\n  Er dayes ten, this dar I saufly seyn.                                1320\r\n  And thanne at erste shul we been so fayn,\r\n  So as we shulle to-gederes ever dwelle,\r\n  Thal al this world ne mighte our blisse telle.\r\n\r\n  190. I see that ofte, ther-as we ben now,\r\n  That for the beste, our conseil for to hyde,                         1325\r\n  Ye speke not with me, nor I with yow\r\n  In fourtenight; ne see yow go ne ryde.\r\n  May ye not ten dayes thanne abyde,\r\n  For myn honour, in swich an aventure?\r\n  Y-wis, ye mowen elles lite endure!                                   1330\r\n\r\n  191. Ye knowe eek how that al my kin is here,\r\n  But-if that onliche it my fader be;\r\n  And eek myn othere thinges alle y-fere,\r\n  And nameliche, my dere herte, ye,\r\n  Whom that I nolde leven for to see                                   1335\r\n  For al this world, as wyd as it hath space;\r\n  Or elles, see ich never Ioves face!\r\n\r\n  192. Why trowe ye my fader in this wyse\r\n  Coveiteth so to see me, but for drede\r\n  Lest in this toun that folkes me dispyse                             1340\r\n  By-cause of him, for his unhappy dede?\r\n  What woot my fader what lyf that I lede?\r\n  For if he wiste in Troye how wel I fare,\r\n  Us neded for my wending nought to care.\r\n\r\n  193. Ye seen that every day eek, more and more,                      1345\r\n  Men trete of pees; and it supposed is,\r\n  That men the quene Eleyne shal restore,\r\n  And Grekes us restore that is mis.\r\n  So though ther nere comfort noon but this,\r\n  That men purposen pees on every syde,                                1350\r\n  Ye may the bettre at ese of herte abyde.\r\n\r\n  194. For if that it be pees, myn herte dere,\r\n  The nature of the pees mot nedes dryve\r\n  That men moste entrecomunen y-fere,\r\n  And to and fro eek ryde and gon as blyve                             1355\r\n  Alday as thikke as been flen from an hyve;\r\n  And every wight han libertee to bleve\r\n  Wher-as him list the bet, with-outen leve.\r\n\r\n  195. And though so be that pees ther may be noon,\r\n  Yet hider, though ther never pees ne were,                           1360\r\n  I moste come; for whider sholde I goon,\r\n  Or how mischaunce sholde I dwelle there\r\n  Among tho men of armes ever in fere?\r\n  For which, as wisly god my soule rede,\r\n  I can not seen wher-of ye sholden drede.                             1365\r\n\r\n  196. Have here another wey, if it so be\r\n  That al this thing ne may yow not suffyse.\r\n  My fader, as ye knowen wel, pardee,\r\n  Is old, and elde is ful of coveityse.\r\n  And I right now have founden al the gyse,                            1370\r\n  With-oute net, wher-with I shal him hente;\r\n  And herkeneth how, if that ye wole assente.\r\n\r\n  197. Lo, Troilus, men seyn that hard it is\r\n  The wolf ful, and the wether hool to have;\r\n  This is to seyn, that men ful ofte, y-wis,                           1375\r\n  Mot spenden part, the remenaunt for to save.\r\n  For ay with gold men may the herte grave\r\n  Of him that set is up-on coveityse;\r\n  And how I mene, I shal it yow devyse.\r\n\r\n  198. The moeble which that I have in this toun                       1380\r\n  Un-to my fader shal I take, and seye,\r\n  That right for trust and for savacioun\r\n  It sent is from a freend of his or tweye,\r\n  The whiche freendes ferventliche him preye\r\n  To senden after more, and that in hye,                               1385\r\n  Whyl that this toun stant thus in Iupartye.\r\n\r\n  199. And that shal been an huge quantitee,\r\n  Thus shal I seyn, but, lest it folk aspyde,\r\n  This may be sent by no wight but by me;\r\n  I shal eek shewen him, if pees bityde,                               1390\r\n  What frendes that ich have on every syde\r\n  Toward the court, to doon the wrathe pace\r\n  Of Priamus, and doon him stonde in grace.\r\n\r\n  200. So, what for o thing and for other, swete,\r\n  I shal him so enchaunten with my sawes,                              1395\r\n  That right in hevene his sowle is, shal he mete!\r\n  For al Appollo, or his clerkes lawes,\r\n  Or calculinge avayleth nought three hawes;\r\n  Desyr of gold shal so his sowle blende,\r\n  That, as me lyst, I shal wel make an ende.                           1400\r\n\r\n  201. And if he wolde ought by his sort it preve\r\n  If that I lye, in certayn I shal fonde\r\n  Distorben him, and plukke him by the sleve,\r\n  Makinge his sort, and beren him on honde,\r\n  He hath not wel the goddes understonde.                              1405\r\n  For goddes speken in amphibologyes,\r\n  And, for a sooth, they tellen twenty lyes.\r\n\r\n  202. Eek drede fond first goddes, I suppose,\r\n  Thus shal I seyn, and that his cowarde herte\r\n  Made him amis the goddes text to glose,                              1410\r\n  Whan he for ferde out of his Delphos sterte.\r\n  And but I make him sone to converte,\r\n  And doon my reed with-inne a day or tweye,\r\n  I wol to yow oblige me to deye.'\r\n\r\n  203. And treweliche, as writen wel I finde,                          1415\r\n  That al this thing was seyd of good entente;\r\n  And that hir herte trewe was and kinde\r\n  Towardes him, and spak right as she mente,\r\n  And that she starf for wo neigh, whan she wente,\r\n  And was in purpos ever to be trewe;                                  1420\r\n  Thus writen they that of hir werkes knewe.\r\n\r\n  204. This Troilus, with herte and eres spradde,\r\n  Herde al this thing devysen to and fro;\r\n  And verraylich him semed that he hadde\r\n  The selve wit; but yet to lete hir go                                1425\r\n  His herte misforyaf him ever-mo.\r\n  But fynally, he gan his herte wreste\r\n  To trusten hir, and took it for the beste.\r\n\r\n  205. For which the grete furie of his penaunce\r\n  Was queynt with hope, and ther-with hem bitwene                      1430\r\n  Bigan for Ioye the amorouse daunce.\r\n  And as the briddes, whan the sonne is shene,\r\n  Delyten in hir song in leves grene,\r\n  Right so the wordes that they spake y-fere\r\n  Delyted hem, and made hir hertes clere.                              1435\r\n\r\n  206. But natheles, the wending of Criseyde,\r\n  For al this world, may nought out of his minde;\r\n  For which ful ofte he pitously hir preyde,\r\n  That of hir heste he might hir trewe finde.\r\n  And seyde hir, 'certes, if ye be unkinde,                            1440\r\n  And but ye come at day set in-to Troye,\r\n  Ne shal I never have hele, honour, ne Ioye.\r\n\r\n  207. For al-so sooth as sonne up-rist on morwe,\r\n  And, god! so wisly thou me, woful wrecche,\r\n  To reste bringe out of this cruel sorwe,                             1445\r\n  I wol my-selven slee if that ye drecche.\r\n  But of my deeth though litel be to recche,\r\n  Yet, er that ye me cause so to smerte,\r\n  Dwel rather here, myn owene swete herte!\r\n\r\n  208. For trewely, myn owene lady dere,                               1450\r\n  Tho sleightes yet that I have herd yow stere\r\n  Ful shaply been to failen alle y-fere.\r\n  For thus men seyn, \"that oon thenketh the bere,\r\n  But al another thenketh his ledere.\"\r\n  Your sire is wys, and seyd is, out of drede,                         1455\r\n  \"Men may the wyse at-renne, and not at-rede.\"\r\n\r\n  209. It is ful hard to halten unespyed\r\n  Bifore a crepul, for he can the craft;\r\n  Your fader is in sleighte as Argus yëd;\r\n  For al be that his moeble is him biraft,                             1460\r\n  His olde sleighte is yet so with him laft,\r\n  Ye shal not blende him for your womanhede,\r\n  Ne feyne a-right, and that is al my drede.\r\n\r\n  210. I noot if pees shal ever-mo bityde;\r\n  But, pees or no, for ernest ne for game,                             1465\r\n  I woot, sin Calkas on the Grekes syde\r\n  Hath ones been, and lost so foule his name,\r\n  He dar no more come here ayein for shame;\r\n  For which that weye, for ought I can espye,\r\n  To trusten on, nis but a fantasye.                                   1470\r\n\r\n  211. Ye shal eek seen, your fader shal yow glose\r\n  To been a wyf, and as he can wel preche,\r\n  He shal som Grek so preyse and wel alose,\r\n  That ravisshen he shal yow with his speche,\r\n  Or do yow doon by force as he shal teche.                            1475\r\n  And Troilus, of whom ye nil han routhe,\r\n  Shal causeles so sterven in his trouthe!\r\n\r\n  212. And over al this, your fader shal despyse\r\n  Us alle, and seyn this citee nis but lorn;\r\n  And that thassege never shal aryse,                                  1480\r\n  For-why the Grekes han it alle sworn\r\n  Til we be slayn, and doun our walles torn.\r\n  And thus he shal you with his wordes fere,\r\n  That ay drede I, that ye wol bleve there.\r\n\r\n  213. Ye shul eek seen so many a lusty knight                         1485\r\n  A-mong the Grekes, ful of worthinesse,\r\n  And eche of hem with herte, wit, and might\r\n  To plesen yow don al his besinesse,\r\n  That ye shul dullen of the rudenesse\r\n  Of us sely Troianes, but-if routhe                                   1490\r\n  Remorde yow, or vertue of your trouthe.\r\n\r\n  214. And this to me so grevous is to thinke,\r\n  That fro my brest it wol my soule rende;\r\n  Ne dredeles, in me ther may not sinke\r\n  A good opinioun, if that ye wende;                                   1495\r\n  For-why your faderes sleighte wol us shende.\r\n  And if ye goon, as I have told yow yore,\r\n  So thenk I nam but deed, with-oute more.\r\n\r\n  215. For which, with humble, trewe, and pitous herte,\r\n  A thousand tymes mercy I yow preye;                                  1500\r\n  So reweth on myn aspre peynes smerte,\r\n  And doth somwhat, as that I shal yow seye,\r\n  And lat us stele away bitwixe us tweye;\r\n  And thenk that folye is, whan man may chese,\r\n  For accident his substaunce ay to lese.                              1505\r\n\r\n  216. I mene this, that sin we mowe er day\r\n  Wel stele away, and been to-gider so,\r\n  What wit were it to putten in assay,\r\n  In cas ye sholden to your fader go,\r\n  If that ye mighte come ayein or no?                                  1510\r\n  Thus mene I, that it were a gret folye\r\n  To putte that sikernesse in Iupartye.\r\n\r\n  217. And vulgarly to speken of substaunce\r\n  Of tresour, may we bothe with us lede\r\n  Y-nough to live in honour and plesaunce,                             1515\r\n  Til in-to tyme that we shul ben dede;\r\n  And thus we may eschewen al this drede.\r\n  For everich other wey ye can recorde,\r\n  Myn herte, y-wis, may not ther-with acorde.\r\n\r\n  218. And hardily, ne dredeth no poverte,                             1520\r\n  For I have kin and freendes elles-where\r\n  That, though we comen in our bare sherte,\r\n  Us sholde neither lakke gold ne gere,\r\n  But been honoured whyl we dwelten there.\r\n  And go we anoon, for, as in myn entente,                             1525\r\n  This is the beste, if that ye wole assente.'\r\n\r\n  219. Criseyde, with a syk, right in this wyse\r\n  Answerde, 'y-wis, my dere herte trewe,\r\n  We may wel stele away, as ye devyse,\r\n  And finde swiche unthrifty weyes newe;                               1530\r\n  But afterward, ful sore it wol us rewe.\r\n  And help me god so at my moste nede\r\n  As causeles ye suffren al this drede!\r\n\r\n  220. For thilke day that I for cherisshinge\r\n  Or drede of fader, or of other wight,                                1535\r\n  Or for estat, delyt, or for weddinge\r\n  Be fals to yow, my Troilus, my knight,\r\n  Saturnes doughter, Iuno, thorugh hir might,\r\n  As wood as Athamante do me dwelle\r\n  Eternaly in Stix, the put of helle!                                  1540\r\n\r\n  221. And this on every god celestial\r\n  I swere it yow, and eek on eche goddesse,\r\n  On every Nymphe and deite infernal,\r\n  On Satiry and Fauny more and lesse,\r\n  That halve goddes been of wildernesse;                               1545\r\n  And Attropos my threed of lyf to-breste\r\n  If I be fals; now trowe me if thow leste!\r\n\r\n  222. And thou, Simoys, that as an arwe clere\r\n  Thorugh Troye rennest ay downward to the see,\r\n  Ber witnesse of this word that seyd is here,                         1550\r\n  That thilke day that ich untrewe be\r\n  To Troilus, myn owene herte free,\r\n  That thou retorne bakwarde to thy welle,\r\n  And I with body and soule sinke in helle!\r\n\r\n  223. But that ye speke, awey thus for to go                          1555\r\n  And leten alle your freendes, god for-bede,\r\n  For any womman, that ye sholden so,\r\n  And namely, sin Troye hath now swich nede\r\n  Of help; and eek of o thing taketh hede,\r\n  If this were wist, my lif laye in balaunce,                          1560\r\n  And your honour; god shilde us fro mischaunce!\r\n\r\n  224. And if so be that pees her-after take,\r\n  As alday happeth, after anger, game,\r\n  Why, lord! the sorwe and wo ye wolden make,\r\n  That ye ne dorste come ayein for shame!                              1565\r\n  And er that ye Iuparten so your name,\r\n  Beth nought to hasty in this hote fare;\r\n  For hasty man ne wanteth never care.\r\n\r\n  225. What trowe ye the peple eek al aboute\r\n  Wolde of it seye? It is ful light to arede.                          1570\r\n  They wolden seye, and swere it, out of doute,\r\n  That love ne droof yow nought to doon this dede,\r\n  But lust voluptuous and coward drede.\r\n  Thus were al lost, y-wis, myn herte dere,\r\n  Your honour, which that now shyneth so clere.                        1575\r\n\r\n  226. And also thenketh on myn honestee,\r\n  That floureth yet, how foule I sholde it shende,\r\n  And with what filthe it spotted sholde be,\r\n  If in this forme I sholde with yow wende.\r\n  Ne though I livede un-to the worldes ende,                           1580\r\n  My name sholde I never ayeinward winne;\r\n  Thus were I lost, and that were routhe and sinne.\r\n\r\n  227. And for-thy slee with reson al this hete;\r\n  Men seyn, \"the suffraunt overcometh,\" pardee;\r\n  Eek \"who-so wol han leef, he leef mot lete;\"                         1585\r\n  Thus maketh vertue of necessitee\r\n  By pacience, and thenk that lord is he\r\n  Of fortune ay, that nought wol of hir recche;\r\n  And she ne daunteth no wight but a wrecche.\r\n\r\n  228. And trusteth this, that certes, herte swete,                    1590\r\n  Er Phebus suster, Lucina the shene,\r\n  The Leoun passe out of this Ariete,\r\n  I wol ben here, with-outen any wene.\r\n  I mene, as helpe me Iuno, hevenes quene,\r\n  The tenthe day, but-if that deeth me assayle,                        1595\r\n  I wol yow seen, with-outen any fayle.'\r\n\r\n  229. 'And now, so this be sooth,' quod Troilus,\r\n  'I shal wel suffre un-to the tenthe day,\r\n  Sin that I see that nede it moot be thus.\r\n  But, for the love of god, if it be may,                              1600\r\n  So lat us stele prively away;\r\n  For ever in oon, as for to live in reste,\r\n  Myn herte seyth that it wol been the beste.'\r\n\r\n  230. 'O mercy, god, what lyf is this?' quod she;\r\n  'Allas, ye slee me thus for verray tene!                             1605\r\n  I see wel now that ye mistrusten me;\r\n  For by your wordes it is wel y-sene.\r\n  Now, for the love of Cynthia the shene,\r\n  Mistrust me not thus causeles, for routhe;\r\n  Sin to be trewe I have yow plight my trouthe.                        1610\r\n\r\n  231. And thenketh wel, that som tyme it is wit\r\n  To spende a tyme, a tyme for to winne;\r\n  Ne, pardee, lorn am I nought fro yow yit,\r\n  Though that we been a day or two a-twinne.\r\n  Dryf out the fantasyes yow with-inne;                                1615\r\n  And trusteth me, and leveth eek your sorwe,\r\n  Or here my trouthe, I wol not live til morwe.\r\n\r\n  232. For if ye wiste how sore it doth me smerte,\r\n  Ye wolde cesse of this; for god, thou wost,\r\n  The pure spirit wepeth in myn herte,                                 1620\r\n  To see yow wepen that I love most,\r\n  And that I moot gon to the Grekes ost.\r\n  Ye, nere it that I wiste remedye\r\n  To come ayein, right here I wolde dye!\r\n\r\n  233. But certes, I am not so nyce a wight                            1625\r\n  That I ne can imaginen a way\r\n  To come ayein that day that I have hight.\r\n  For who may holde thing that wol a-way?\r\n  My fader nought, for al his queynte pley.\r\n  And by my thrift, my wending out of Troye                            1630\r\n  Another day shal torne us alle to Ioye.\r\n\r\n  234. For-thy, with al myn herte I yow beseke,\r\n  If that yow list don ought for my preyere,\r\n  And for the love which that I love yow eke,\r\n  That er that I departe fro yow here,                                 1635\r\n  That of so good a comfort and a chere\r\n  I may you seen, that ye may bringe at reste\r\n  Myn herte, which that is at point to breste.\r\n\r\n  235. And over al this, I pray yow,' quod she tho,\r\n  'Myn owene hertes soothfast suffisaunce,                             1640\r\n  Sin I am thyn al hool, with-outen mo,\r\n  That whyl that I am absent, no plesaunce\r\n  Of othere do me fro your remembraunce.\r\n  For I am ever a-gast, for-why men rede,\r\n  That \"love is thing ay ful of bisy drede.\"                           1645\r\n\r\n  236. For in this world ther liveth lady noon,\r\n  If that ye were untrewe, as god defende!\r\n  That so bitraysed were or wo bigoon\r\n  As I, that alle trouthe in yow entende.\r\n  And douteles, if that ich other wende,                               1650\r\n  I nere but deed; and er ye cause finde,\r\n  For goddes love, so beth me not unkinde.'\r\n\r\n  237. To this answerde Troilus and seyde,\r\n  'Now god, to whom ther nis no cause y-wrye,\r\n  Me glade, as wis I never un-to Criseyde,                             1655\r\n  Sin thilke day I saw hir first with yë,\r\n  Was fals, ne never shal til that I dye.\r\n  At shorte wordes, wel ye may me leve;\r\n  I can no more, it shal be founde at preve.'\r\n\r\n  238. 'Graunt mercy, goode myn, y-wis,' quod she,                     1660\r\n  'And blisful Venus lat me never sterve\r\n  Er I may stonde of plesaunce in degree\r\n  To quyte him wel, that so wel can deserve;\r\n  And whyl that god my wit wol me conserve,\r\n  I shal so doon, so trewe I have yow founde,                          1665\r\n  That ay honour to me-ward shal rebounde.\r\n\r\n  239. For trusteth wel, that your estat royal\r\n  Ne veyn delyt, nor only worthinesse\r\n  Of yow in werre, or torney marcial,\r\n  Ne pompe, array, nobley, or eek richesse,                            1670\r\n  Ne made me to rewe on your distresse;\r\n  But moral vertue, grounded upon trouthe,\r\n  That was the cause I first hadde on yow routhe!\r\n\r\n  240. Eek gentil herte and manhod that ye hadde,\r\n  And that ye hadde, as me thoughte, in despyt                         1675\r\n  Every thing that souned in-to badde,\r\n  As rudenesse and poeplish appetyt;\r\n  And that your reson brydled your delyt,\r\n  This made, aboven every creature,\r\n  That I was your, and shal, whyl I may dure.                          1680\r\n\r\n  241. And this may lengthe of yeres not for-do,\r\n  Ne remuable fortune deface;\r\n  But Iuppiter, that of his might may do\r\n  The sorwful to be glad, so yeve us grace,\r\n  Er nightes ten, to meten in this place,                              1685\r\n  So that it may your herte and myn suffyse;\r\n  And fareth now wel, for tyme is that ye ryse.'\r\n\r\n  242. And after that they longe y-pleyned hadde,\r\n  And ofte y-kist and streite in armes folde,\r\n  The day gan ryse, and Troilus him cladde,                            1690\r\n  And rewfulliche his lady gan biholde,\r\n  As he that felte dethes cares colde.\r\n  And to hir grace he gan him recomaunde;\r\n  Wher him was wo, this holde I no demaunde.\r\n\r\n  243. For mannes heed imaginen ne can,                                1695\r\n  Ne entendement considere, ne tonge telle\r\n  The cruel peynes of this sorwful man,\r\n  That passen every torment doun in helle.\r\n  For whan he saugh that she ne mighte dwelle,\r\n  Which that his soule out of his herte rente,                         1700\r\n  With-outen more, out of the chaumbre he wente.\r\n\r\nExplicit Liber Quartus.\r\n\r\nTITLE. _Not in the_ MSS. // C. _has lost ll._  1-112. 4.

Aprochen gan the fatal destinee\r\n  That Ioves hath in disposicioun,\r\n  And to yow, angry Parcas, sustren three,\r\n  Committeth, to don execucioun;\r\n  For which Criseyde moste out of the toun,                               5\r\n  And Troilus shal dwelle forth in pyne\r\n  Til Lachesis his threed no lenger twyne.--\r\n\r\n  2. The golden-tressed. Phebus heighe on-lofte\r\n  Thryës hadde alle with his bemes shene\r\n  The snowes molte, and Zephirus as ofte                                 10\r\n  Y-brought ayein the tendre leves grene,\r\n  Sin that the sone of Ecuba the quene\r\n  Bigan to love hir first, for whom his sorwe\r\n  Was al, that she departe sholde a-morwe.\r\n\r\n  3. Ful redy was at pryme Dyomede,                                      15\r\n  Criseyde un-to the Grekes ost to lede,\r\n  For sorwe of which she felte hir herte blede,\r\n  As she that niste what was best to rede.\r\n  And trewely, as men in bokes rede,\r\n  Men wiste never womman han the care,                                   20\r\n  Ne was so looth out of a toun to fare.\r\n\r\n  4. This Troilus, with-outen reed or lore,\r\n  As man that hath his Ioyes eek forlore,\r\n  Was waytinge on his lady ever-more\r\n  As she that was the soothfast crop and more                            25\r\n  Of al his lust, or Ioyes here-tofore.\r\n  But Troilus, now farewel al thy Ioye,\r\n  For shaltow never seen hir eft in Troye!\r\n\r\n  5. Soth is, that whyl he bood in this manere,\r\n  He gan his wo ful manly for to hyde,                                   30\r\n  That wel unnethe it seen was in his chere;\r\n  But at the yate ther she sholde oute ryde\r\n  With certeyn folk, he hoved hir tabyde,\r\n  So wo bigoon, al wolde he nought him pleyne,\r\n  That on his hors unnethe he sat for peyne.                             35\r\n\r\n  6. For ire he quook, so gan his herte gnawe,\r\n  Whan Diomede on horse gan him dresse,\r\n  And seyde un-to him-self this ilke sawe,\r\n  'Allas,' quod he, 'thus foul a wrecchednesse\r\n  Why suffre ich it, why nil ich it redresse?                            40\r\n  Were it not bet at ones for to dye\r\n  Than ever-more in langour thus to drye?\r\n\r\n  7. Why nil I make at ones riche and pore\r\n  To have y-nough to done, er that she go?\r\n  Why nil I bringe al Troye upon a rore?                                 45\r\n  Why nil I sleen this Diomede also?\r\n  Why nil I rather with a man or two\r\n  Stele hir a-way? Why wol I this endure?\r\n  Why nil I helpen to myn owene cure?'\r\n\r\n  8. But why he nolde doon so fel a dede,                                50\r\n  That shal I seyn, and why him liste it spare:\r\n  He hadde in herte alwey a maner drede,\r\n  Lest that Criseyde, in rumour of this fare,\r\n  Sholde han ben slayn; lo, this was al his care.\r\n  And elles, certeyn, as I seyde yore,                                   55\r\n  He hadde it doon, with-outen wordes more.\r\n\r\n  9. Criseyde, whan she redy was to ryde,\r\n  Ful sorwfully she sighte, and seyde 'allas!'\r\n  But forth she moot, for ought that may bityde,\r\n  And forth she rit ful sorwfully a pas.                                 60\r\n  Ther nis non other remedie in this cas.\r\n  What wonder is though that hir sore smerte,\r\n  Whan she forgoth hir owene swete herte?\r\n\r\n  10. This Troilus, in wyse of curteisye,\r\n  With hauke on hond, and with an huge route                             65\r\n  Of knightes, rood and dide hir companye,\r\n  Passinge al the valey fer with-oute.\r\n  And ferther wolde han riden, out of doute,\r\n  Ful fayn, and wo was him to goon so sone;\r\n  But torne he moste, and it was eek to done.                            70\r\n\r\n  11. And right with that was Antenor y-come\r\n  Out of the Grekes ost, and every wight\r\n  Was of it glad, and seyde he was wel-come.\r\n  And Troilus, al nere his herte light,\r\n  He peyned him with al his fulle might                                  75\r\n  Him to with-holde of wepinge at the leste,\r\n  And Antenor he kiste, and made feste.\r\n\r\n  12. And ther-with-al he moste his leve take,\r\n  And caste his eye upon hir pitously,\r\n  And neer he rood, his cause for to make,                               80\r\n  To take hir by the honde al sobrely.\r\n  And lord! so she gan wepen tendrely!\r\n  And he ful softe and sleighly gan hir seye,\r\n  'Now hold your day, and dooth me not to deye.'\r\n\r\n  13. With that his courser torned he a-boute                            85\r\n  With face pale, and un-to Diomede\r\n  No word he spak, ne noon of al his route;\r\n  Of which the sone of Tydeus took hede,\r\n  As he that coude more than the crede\r\n  In swich a craft, and by the reyne hir hente;                          90\r\n  And Troilus to Troye homwarde he wente.\r\n\r\n  14. This Diomede, that ladde hir by the brydel,\r\n  Whan that he saw the folk of Troye aweye,\r\n  Thoughte, 'al my labour shal not been on ydel,\r\n  If that I may, for somwhat shal I seye.                                95\r\n  For at the worste it may yet shorte our weye.\r\n  I have herd seyd, eek tymes twyës twelve,\r\n  \"He is a fool that wol for-yete him-selve.\"'\r\n\r\n  15. But natheles this thoughte he wel ynough,\r\n  'That certaynly I am aboute nought                                    100\r\n  If that I speke of love, or make it tough;\r\n  For douteles, if she have in hir thought\r\n  Him that I gesse, he may not been y-brought\r\n  So sone awey; but I shal finde a mene,\r\n  That she not wite as yet shal what I mene.'                           105\r\n\r\n  16. This Diomede, as he that coude his good,\r\n  Whan this was doon, gan fallen forth in speche\r\n  Of this and that, and asked why she stood\r\n  In swich disese, and gan hir eek biseche,\r\n  That if that he encrese mighte or eche                                110\r\n  With any thing hir ese, that she sholde\r\n  Comaunde it him, and seyde he doon it wolde.\r\n\r\n  17. For trewely he swoor hir, as a knight,\r\n  That ther nas thing with whiche he mighte hir plese,\r\n  That he nolde doon his peyne and al his might                         115\r\n  To doon it, for to doon hir herte an ese.\r\n  And preyede hir, she wolde hir sorwe apese,\r\n  And seyde, 'y-wis, we Grekes con have Ioye\r\n  To honouren yow, as wel as folk of Troye.'\r\n\r\n  18. He seyde eek thus, 'I woot, yow thinketh straunge,                120\r\n  No wonder is, for it is to yow newe,\r\n  Thaqueintaunce of these Troianes to chaunge,\r\n  For folk of Grece, that ye never knewe.\r\n  But wolde never god but-if as trewe\r\n  A Greek ye shulde among us alle finde                                 125\r\n  As any Troian is, and eek as kinde.\r\n\r\n  19. And by the cause I swoor yow right, lo, now,\r\n  To been your freend, and helply, to my might,\r\n  And for that more acqueintaunce eek of yow\r\n  Have ich had than another straunger wight,                            130\r\n  So fro this forth I pray yow, day and night,\r\n  Comaundeth me, how sore that me smerte,\r\n  To doon al that may lyke un-to your herte;\r\n\r\n  20. And that ye me wolde as your brother trete,\r\n  And taketh not my frendship in despyt;                                135\r\n  And though your sorwes be for thinges grete,\r\n  Noot I not why, but out of more respyt,\r\n  Myn herte hath for to amende it greet delyt.\r\n  And if I may your harmes not redresse,\r\n  I am right sory for your hevinesse.                                   140\r\n\r\n  21. And though ye Troians with us Grekes wrothe\r\n  Han many a day be, alwey yet, pardee,\r\n  O god of love in sooth we serven bothe.\r\n  And, for the love of god, my lady free,\r\n  Whom so ye hate, as beth not wroth with me.                           145\r\n  For trewely, ther can no wight yow serve,\r\n  That half so looth your wraththe wolde deserve.\r\n\r\n  22. And nere it that we been so neigh the tente\r\n  Of Calkas, which that seen us bothe may,\r\n  I wolde of this yow telle al myn entente;                             150\r\n  But this enseled til another day.\r\n  Yeve me your hond, I am, and shal ben ay,\r\n  God help me so, whyl that my lyf may dure,\r\n  Your owene aboven every creature.\r\n\r\n  23. Thus seyde I never er now to womman born;                         155\r\n  For god myn herte as wisly glade so,\r\n  I lovede never womman here-biforn\r\n  As paramours ne never shal no mo.\r\n  And, for the love of god, beth not my fo;\r\n  Al can I not to yow, my lady dere,                                    160\r\n  Compleyne aright, for I am yet to lere.\r\n\r\n  24. And wondreth not, myn owene lady bright,\r\n  Though that I speke of love to you thus blyve;\r\n  For I have herd or this of many a wight,\r\n  Hath loved thing he never saugh his lyve.                             165\r\n  Eek I am not of power for to stryve\r\n  Ayens the god of love, but him obeye\r\n  I wol alwey, and mercy I yow preye.\r\n\r\n  25. Ther been so worthy knightes in this place,\r\n  And ye so fair, that everich of hem alle                              170\r\n  Wol peynen him to stonden in your grace.\r\n  But mighte me so fair a grace falle,\r\n  That ye me for your servaunt wolde calle,\r\n  So lowly ne so trewely you serve\r\n  Nil noon of hem, as I shal, til I sterve.'                            175\r\n\r\n  26. Criseide un-to that purpos lyte answerde,\r\n  As she that was with sorwe oppressed so\r\n  That, in effect, she nought his tales herde,\r\n  But here and there, now here a word or two.\r\n  Hir thoughte hir sorwful herte brast a-two.                           180\r\n  For whan she gan hir fader fer aspye,\r\n  Wel neigh doun of hir hors she gan to sye.\r\n\r\n  27. But natheles she thonked Diomede\r\n  Of al his travaile, and his goode chere,\r\n  And that him liste his friendship hir to bede;                        185\r\n  And she accepteth it in good manere,\r\n  And wolde do fayn that is him leef and dere;\r\n  And trusten him she wolde, and wel she mighte,\r\n  As seyde she, and from hir hors she alighte.\r\n\r\n  28. Hir fader hath hir in his armes nome,                             190\r\n  And tweynty tyme he kiste his doughter swete,\r\n  And seyde, 'O dere doughter myn, wel-come!'\r\n  She seyde eek, she was fayn with him to mete,\r\n  And stood forth mewet, mildë, and mansuete.\r\n  But here I leve hir with hir fader dwelle,                            195\r\n  And forth I wol of Troilus yow telle.\r\n\r\n  29. To Troye is come this woful Troilus,\r\n  In sorwe aboven alle sorwes smerte,\r\n  With felon look, and face dispitous.\r\n  Tho sodeinly doun from his hors he sterte,                            200\r\n  And thorugh his paleys, with a swollen herte,\r\n  To chambre he wente; of no-thing took he hede,\r\n  Ne noon to him dar speke a word for drede.\r\n\r\n  30. And there his sorwes that he spared hadde\r\n  He yaf an issue large, and 'deeth!' he cryde;                         205\r\n  And in his throwes frenetyk and madde\r\n  He cursed Iove, Appollo, and eek Cupyde,\r\n  He cursed Ceres, Bacus, and Cipryde,\r\n  His burthe, him-self, his fate, and eek nature,\r\n  And, save his lady, every creature.                                   210\r\n\r\n  31. To bedde he goth, and weyleth there and torneth\r\n  In furie, as dooth he, Ixion, in helle;\r\n  And in this wyse he neigh til day soiorneth.\r\n  But tho bigan his herte a lyte unswelle\r\n  Thorugh teres which that gonnen up to welle;                          215\r\n  And pitously he cryde up-on Criseyde,\r\n  And to him-self right thus he spak, and seyde:--\r\n\r\n  32. 'Wher is myn owene lady lief and dere,\r\n  Wher is hir whyte brest, wher is it, where?\r\n  Wher ben hir armes and hir eyen clere,                                220\r\n  That yesternight this tyme with me were?\r\n  Now may I wepe allone many a tere,\r\n  And graspe aboute I may, but in this place,\r\n  Save a pilowe, I finde nought tenbrace.\r\n\r\n  33. How shal I do? Whan shal she com ayeyn?                           225\r\n  I noot, allas! why leet ich hir to go?\r\n  As wolde god, ich hadde as tho be sleyn!\r\n  O herte myn, Criseyde, O swete fo!\r\n  O lady myn, that I love and no mo!\r\n  To whom for ever-mo myn herte I dowe;                                 230\r\n  See how I deye, ye nil me not rescowe!\r\n\r\n  34. Who seeth yow now, my righte lode-sterre?\r\n  Who sit right now or stant in your presence?\r\n  Who can conforten now your hertes werre?\r\n  Now I am gon, whom yeve ye audience?                                  235\r\n  Who speketh for me right now in myn absence?\r\n  Allas, no wight; and that is al my care;\r\n  For wel wot I, as yvel as I ye fare.\r\n\r\n  35. How shulde I thus ten dayes ful endure,\r\n  Whan I the firste night have al this tene?                            240\r\n  How shal she doon eek, sorwful creature?\r\n  For tendernesse, how shal she this sustene,\r\n  Swich wo for me? O pitous, pale, and grene\r\n  Shal been your fresshe wommanliche face\r\n  For langour, er ye torne un-to this place.'                           245\r\n\r\n  36. And whan he fil in any slomeringes,\r\n  Anoon biginne he sholde for to grone,\r\n  And dremen of the dredfulleste thinges\r\n  That mighte been; as, mete he were allone\r\n  In place horrible, makinge ay his mone,                               250\r\n  Or meten that he was amonges alle\r\n  His enemys, and in hir hondes falle.\r\n\r\n  37. And ther-with-al his body sholde sterte,\r\n  And with the stert al sodeinliche awake,\r\n  And swich a tremour fele aboute his herte,                            255\r\n  That of the feer his body sholde quake;\r\n  And there-with-al he sholde a noyse make,\r\n  And seme as though he sholde falle depe\r\n  From heighe a-lofte; and than he wolde wepe,\r\n\r\n  38. And rewen on him-self so pitously,                                260\r\n  That wonder was to here his fantasye.\r\n  Another tyme he sholde mightily\r\n  Conforte him-self, and seyn it was folye,\r\n  So causeles swich drede for to drye,\r\n  And eft biginne his aspre sorwes newe,                                265\r\n  That every man mighte on his sorwes rewe.\r\n\r\n  39.

On hevene yet the sterres were sene,\r\n  Al-though ful pale y-waxen was the mone;                              275\r\n  And whyten gan the orisonte shene\r\n  Al estward, as it woned is to done.\r\n  And Phebus with his rosy carte sone\r\n  Gan after that to dresse him up to fare,\r\n  Whan Troilus hath sent after Pandare.                                 280\r\n\r\n  41. This Pandare, that of al the day biforn\r\n  Ne mighte have comen Troilus to see,\r\n  Al-though he on his heed it hadde y-sworn,\r\n  For with the king Pryam alday was he,\r\n  So that it lay not in his libertee                                    285\r\n  No-wher to gon, but on the morwe he wente\r\n  To Troilus, whan that he for him sente.\r\n\r\n  42. For in his herte he coude wel devyne,\r\n  That Troilus al night for sorwe wook;\r\n  And that he wolde telle him of his pyne,                              290\r\n  This knew he wel y-nough, with-oute book.\r\n  For which to chaumbre streight the wey he took,\r\n  And Troilus tho sobreliche he grette,\r\n  And on the bed ful sone he gan him sette.\r\n\r\n  43. 'My Pandarus,' quod Troilus, 'the sorwe                           295\r\n  Which that I drye, I may not longe endure.\r\n  I trowe I shal not liven til to-morwe;\r\n  For whiche I wolde alwey, on aventure,\r\n  To thee devysen of my sepulture\r\n  The forme, and of my moeble thou dispone                              300\r\n  Right as thee semeth best is for to done.\r\n\r\n  44. But of the fyr and flaumbe funeral\r\n  In whiche my body brenne shal to glede,\r\n  And of the feste and pleyes palestral\r\n  At my vigile, I pray thee take good hede                              305\r\n  That al be wel; and offre Mars my stede,\r\n  My swerd, myn helm, and, leve brother dere,\r\n  My sheld to Pallas yef, that shyneth clere.\r\n\r\n  45.

Pandare answerde, and seyde, 'Troilus,\r\n  My dere freend, as I have told thee yore,\r\n  That it is folye for to sorwen thus,                                  325\r\n  And causeles, for whiche I can no-more.\r\n  But who-so wol not trowen reed ne lore,\r\n  I can not seen in him no remedye,\r\n  But lete him worthen with his fantasye.\r\n\r\n  48. But Troilus, I pray thee tel me now,                              330\r\n  If that thou trowe, er this, that any wight\r\n  Hath loved paramours as wel as thou?\r\n  Ye, god wot, and fro many a worthy knight\r\n  Hath his lady goon a fourtenight,\r\n  And he not yet made halvendel the fare.                               335\r\n  What nede is thee to maken al this care?\r\n\r\n  49.

Rys, lat us speke of lusty lyf in Troye\r\n  That we han lad, and forth the tyme dryve;\r\n  And eek of tyme cominge us reioye,                                    395\r\n  That bringen shal our blisse now so blyve;\r\n  And langour of these twyës dayes fyve\r\n  We shal ther-with so foryete or oppresse,\r\n  That wel unnethe it doon shal us duresse.\r\n\r\n  58.

Now rys, my dere brother Troilus;\r\n  For certes, it noon honour is to thee\r\n  To wepe, and in thy bed to iouken thus.\r\n  For trewely, of o thing trust to me,                                  410\r\n  If thou thus ligge a day, or two, or three,\r\n  The folk wol wene that thou, for cowardyse,\r\n  Thee feynest syk, and that thou darst not ryse.'\r\n\r\n  60. This Troilus answerde, 'O brother dere,\r\n  This knowen folk that han y-suffred peyne,                            415\r\n  That though he wepe and make sorwful chere,\r\n  That feleth harm and smert in every veyne,\r\n  No wonder is; and though I ever pleyne,\r\n  Or alwey wepe, I am no-thing to blame,\r\n  Sin I have lost the cause of al my game.                              420\r\n\r\n  61. But sin of fyne force I moot aryse,\r\n  I shal aryse, as sone as ever I may;\r\n  And god, to whom myn herte I sacrifyse,\r\n  So sende us hastely the tenthe day!\r\n  For was ther never fowl so fayn of May,                               425\r\n  As I shal been, whan that she cometh in Troye,\r\n  That cause is of my torment and my Ioye.\r\n\r\n  62. But whider is thy reed,' quod Troilus,\r\n  'That we may pleye us best in al this toun?'\r\n  'By god, my conseil is,' quod Pandarus,                               430\r\n  'To ryde and pleye us with king Sarpedoun.'\r\n  So longe of this they speken up and doun,\r\n  Til Troilus gan at the laste assente\r\n  To ryse, and forth to Sarpedoun they wente.\r\n\r\n  63. This Sarpedoun, as he that honourable                             435\r\n  Was ever his lyve, and ful of heigh prowesse,\r\n  With al that mighte y-served been on table,\r\n  That deyntee was, al coste it greet richesse,\r\n  He fedde hem day by day, that swich noblesse,\r\n  As seyden bothe the moste and eek the leste,                          440\r\n  Was never er that day wist at any feste.\r\n\r\n  64. Nor in this world ther is non instrument\r\n  Delicious, through wind, or touche, or corde,\r\n  As fer as any wight hath ever y-went,\r\n  That tonge telle or herte may recorde,                                445\r\n  That at that feste it nas wel herd acorde;\r\n  Ne of ladies eek so fayr a companye\r\n  On daunce, er tho, was never y-seyn with yë.\r\n\r\n  65. But what avayleth this to Troilus,\r\n  That for his sorwe no-thing of it roughte?                            450\r\n  For ever in oon his herte piëtous\r\n  Ful bisily Criseyde his lady soughte.\r\n  On hir was ever al that his herte thoughte.\r\n  Now this, now that, so faste imagininge,\r\n  That glade, y-wis, can him no festeyinge.                             455\r\n\r\n  66. These ladies eek that at this feste been,\r\n  Sin that he saw his lady was a-weye,\r\n  It was his sorwe upon hem for to seen,\r\n  Or for to here on instrumentz so pleye.\r\n  For she, that of his herte berth the keye,                            460\r\n  Was absent, lo, this was his fantasye,\r\n  That no wight sholde make melodye.\r\n\r\n  67. Nor ther nas houre in al the day or night,\r\n  Whan he was ther-as no wight mighte him here,\r\n  That he ne seyde, 'O lufsom lady bright,                              465\r\n  How have ye faren, sin that ye were here?\r\n  Wel-come, y-wis, myn owene lady dere.'\r\n  But welaway, al this nas but a mase;\r\n  Fortune his howve entended bet to glase.\r\n\r\n  68. The lettres eek, that she of olde tyme                            470\r\n  Hadde him y-sent, he wolde allone rede,\r\n  An hundred sythe, a-twixen noon and pryme;\r\n  Refiguringe hir shap, hir womanhede,\r\n  With-inne his herte, and every word and dede\r\n  That passed was, and thus he droof to an ende                         475\r\n  The ferthe day, and seyde, he wolde wende.\r\n\r\n  69. And seyde, 'leve brother Pandarus,\r\n  Intendestow that we shul herë bleve\r\n  Til Sarpedoun wol forth congeyen us?\r\n  Yet were it fairer that we toke our leve.                             480\r\n  For goddes love, lat us now sone at eve\r\n  Our leve take, and homward lat us torne;\r\n  For trewely, I nil not thus soiorne.'\r\n\r\n  70. Pandare answerde, 'be we comen hider\r\n  To fecchen fyr, and rennen hoom ayeyn?                                485\r\n  God helpe me so, I can not tellen whider\r\n  We mighten goon, if I shal soothly seyn,\r\n  Ther any wight is of us more fayn\r\n  Than Sarpedoun; and if we hennes hye\r\n  Thus sodeinly, I holde it vilanye,                                    490\r\n\r\n  71. Sin that we seyden that we wolde bleve\r\n  With him a wouke; and now, thus sodeinly,\r\n  The ferthe day to take of him our leve,\r\n  He wolde wondren on it, trewely!\r\n  Lat us holde forth our purpos fermely;                                495\r\n  And sin that ye bihighten him to byde,\r\n  Hold forward now, and after lat us ryde.'\r\n\r\n  72. Thus Pandarus, with alle peyne and wo,\r\n  Made him to dwelle; and at the woukes ende,\r\n  Of Sarpedoun they toke hir leve tho,                                  500\r\n  And on hir wey they spedden hem to wende.\r\n  Quod Troilus, 'now god me grace sende,\r\n  That I may finden, at myn hom-cominge,\r\n  Criseyde comen!' and ther-with gan he singe.\r\n\r\n  73. 'Ye, hasel-wode!' thoughte this Pandare,                          505\r\n  And to him-self ful softely he seyde,\r\n  'God woot, refreyden may this hote fare\r\n  Er Calkas sende Troilus Criseyde!'\r\n  But natheles, he Iaped thus, and seyde,\r\n  And swor, y-wis, his herte him wel bihighte,                          510\r\n  She wolde come as sone as ever she mighte.\r\n\r\n  74. Whan they un-to the paleys were y-comen\r\n  Of Troilus, they doun of hors alighte,\r\n  And to the chambre hir wey than han they nomen.\r\n  And in-to tyme that it gan to nighte,                                 515\r\n  They spaken of Crisëyde the brighte.\r\n  And after this, whan that hem bothe leste,\r\n  They spedde hem fro the soper un-to reste.\r\n\r\n  75. On morwe, as sone as day bigan to clere,\r\n  This Troilus gan of his sleep tabreyde,                               520\r\n  And to Pandare, his owene brother dere,\r\n  'For love of god,' ful pitously he seyde,\r\n  'As go we seen the paleys of Criseyde;\r\n  For sin we yet may have namore feste,\r\n  So lat us seen hir paleys at the leste.'                              525\r\n\r\n  76. And ther-with-al, his meyne for to blende,\r\n  A cause he fond in toune for to go,\r\n  And to Criseydes hous they gonnen wende.\r\n  But lord! this sely Troilus was wo!\r\n  Him thoughte his sorweful herte braste a-two.                         530\r\n  For whan he saugh hir dores sperred alle,\r\n  Wel neigh for sorwe a-doun he gan to falle.\r\n\r\n  77. Therwith whan he was war and gan biholde\r\n  How shet was every windowe of the place,\r\n  As frost, him thoughte, his herte gan to colde;                       535\r\n  For which with chaunged deedlich pale face,\r\n  With-outen word, he forth bigan to pace;\r\n  And, as god wolde, he gan so faste ryde,\r\n  That no wight of his contenaunce aspyde.\r\n\r\n  78. Than seyde he thus, 'O paleys desolat,                            540\r\n  O hous, of houses whylom best y-hight,\r\n  O paleys empty and disconsolat,\r\n  O thou lanterne, of which queynt is the light,\r\n  O paleys, whylom day, that now art night,\r\n  Wel oughtestow to falle, and I to dye,                                545\r\n  Sin she is went that wont was us to gye!\r\n\r\n  79.

Ther-with he caste on Pandarus his yë\r\n  With chaunged face, and pitous to biholde;                            555\r\n  And whan he mighte his tyme aright aspye,\r\n  Ay as he rood, to Pandarus he tolde\r\n  His newe sorwe, and eek his Ioyes olde,\r\n  So pitously and with so dede an hewe,\r\n  That every wight mighte on his sorwe rewe.                            560\r\n\r\n  81. Fro thennesforth he rydeth up and doun,\r\n  And every thing com him to remembraunce\r\n  As he rood forth by places of the toun\r\n  In whiche he whylom hadde al his plesaunce.\r\n  'Lo, yond saugh I myn owene lady daunce;                              565\r\n  And in that temple, with hir eyen clere,\r\n  Me caughte first my righte lady dere.\r\n\r\n  82.

Distreyne hir herte as faste to retorne\r\n  As thou dost myn to longen hir to see;\r\n  Than woot I wel, that she nil not soiorne.\r\n  Now, blisful lord, so cruel thou ne be\r\n  Un-to the blood of Troye, I preye thee,                               600\r\n  As Iuno was un-to the blood Thebane,\r\n  For which the folk of Thebes caughte hir bane.'\r\n\r\n  87. And after this he to the yates wente\r\n  Ther-as Criseyde out-rood a ful good paas,\r\n  And up and doun ther made he many a wente,                            605\r\n  And to him-self ful ofte he seyde 'allas!\r\n  From hennes rood my blisse and my solas!\r\n  As wolde blisful god now, for his Ioye,\r\n  I mighte hir seen ayein come in-to Troye.\r\n\r\n  88. And to the yonder hille I gan hir gyde,                           610\r\n  Allas! and there I took of hir my leve!\r\n  And yond I saugh hir to hir fader ryde,\r\n  For sorwe of which myn herte shal to-cleve.\r\n  And hider hoom I com whan it was eve;\r\n  And here I dwelle out-cast from alle Ioye,                            615\r\n  And shal, til I may seen hir eft in Troye.'\r\n\r\n  89. And of him-self imagined he ofte\r\n  To ben defet, and pale, and waxen lesse\r\n  Than he was wont, and that men seyde softe,\r\n  'What may it be? who can the sothe gesse                              620\r\n  Why Troilus hath al this hevinesse?'\r\n  And al this nas but his malencolye,\r\n  That he hadde of him-self swich fantasye.\r\n\r\n  90. Another tyme imaginen he wolde\r\n  That every wight that wente by the weye                               625\r\n  Had of him routhe, and that they seyen sholde,\r\n  'I am right sory Troilus wol deye.'\r\n  And thus he droof a day yet forth or tweye.\r\n  As ye have herd, swich lyf right gan he lede,\r\n  As he that stood bitwixen hope and drede.                             630\r\n\r\n  91. For which him lyked in his songes shewe\r\n  Thencheson of his wo, as he best mighte,\r\n  And make a song of wordes but a fewe,\r\n  Somwhat his woful herte for to lighte.\r\n  And whan he was from every mannes sighte,                             635\r\n  With softe voys he, of his lady dere,\r\n  That was absent, gan singe as ye may here.\r\n\r\n  92. 'O sterre, of which I lost have al the light,\r\n  With herte soor wel oughte I to bewayle,\r\n  That ever derk in torment, night by night,                            640\r\n  Toward my deeth with wind in stere I sayle;\r\n  For which the tenthe night if that I fayle\r\n  The gyding of thy bemes brighte an houre,\r\n  My ship and me Caribdis wol devoure.'\r\n\r\n  93. This song when he thus songen hadde, sone                         645\r\n  He fil ayein in-to his sykes olde;\r\n  And every night, as was his wone to done,\r\n  He stood the brighte mone to beholde,\r\n  And al his sorwe he to the mone tolde;\r\n  And seyde, 'y-wis, whan thou art horned newe,                         650\r\n  I shal be glad, if al the world be trewe!\r\n\r\n  94. I saugh thyn hornes olde eek by the morwe,\r\n  Whan hennes rood my righte lady dere,\r\n  That cause is of my torment and my sorwe;\r\n  For whiche, O brighte Lucina the clere,                               655\r\n  For love of god, ren faste aboute thy spere!\r\n  For whan thyn hornes newe ginne springe,\r\n  Than shal she come, that may my blisse bringe!'\r\n\r\n  95. The day is more, and lenger every night,\r\n  Than they be wont to be, him thoughte tho;                            660\r\n  And that the sonne wente his course unright\r\n  By lenger wey than it was wont to go;\r\n  And seyde, 'y-wis, me dredeth ever-mo,\r\n  The sonnes sone, Pheton, be on-lyve,\r\n  And that his fadres cart amis he dryve.'                              665\r\n\r\n  96. Upon the walles faste eek wolde he walke,\r\n  And on the Grekes ost he wolde see,\r\n  And to him-self right thus he wolde talke,\r\n  'Lo, yonder is myn owene lady free,\r\n  Or elles yonder, ther tho tentes be!                                  670\r\n  And thennes comth this eyr, that is so sote,\r\n  That in my soule I fele it doth me bote.\r\n\r\n  97. And hardely this wind, that more and more\r\n  Thus stoundemele encreseth in my face,\r\n  Is of my ladyes depe sykes sore.                                      675\r\n  I preve it thus, for in non othere place\r\n  Of al this toun, save onliche in this space,\r\n  Fele I no wind that souneth so lyk peyne;\r\n  It seyth, \"allas! why twinned be we tweyne?\"'\r\n\r\n  98. This longe tyme he dryveth forth right thus,                      680\r\n  Til fully passed was the nynthe night;\r\n  And ay bi-syde him was this Pandarus,\r\n  That bisily dide alle his fulle might\r\n  Him to comforte, and make his herte light;\r\n  Yevinge him hope alwey, the tenthe morwe                              685\r\n  That she shal come, and stinten al his sorwe.\r\n\r\n  99. Up-on that other syde eek was Criseyde,\r\n  With wommen fewe, among the Grekes stronge;\r\n  For which ful ofte a day 'allas!' she seyde,\r\n  'That I was born! Wel may myn herte longe                             690\r\n  After my deeth; for now live I to longe!\r\n  Allas! and I ne may it not amende;\r\n  For now is wors than ever yet I wende.\r\n\r\n  100. My fader nil for no-thing do me grace\r\n  To goon ayein, for nought I can him queme;                            695\r\n  And if so be that I my terme passe,\r\n  My Troilus shal in his herte deme\r\n  That I am fals, and so it may wel seme.\r\n  Thus shal I have unthank on every syde;\r\n  That I was born, so weylawey the tyde!                                700\r\n\r\n  101. And if that I me putte in Iupartye,\r\n  To stele awey by nighte, and it bifalle\r\n  That I be caught, I shal be holde a spye;\r\n  Or elles, lo, this drede I most of alle,\r\n  If in the hondes of som wrecche I falle,                              705\r\n  I am but lost, al be myn herte trewe;\r\n  Now mighty god, thou on my sorwe rewe!'\r\n\r\n  102. Ful pale y-waxen was hir brighte face,\r\n  Hir limes lene, as she that al the day\r\n  Stood whan she dorste, and loked on the place                         710\r\n  Ther she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde ay.\r\n  And al the night wepinge, allas! she lay.\r\n  And thus despeired, out of alle cure,\r\n  She ladde hir lyf, this woful creature.\r\n\r\n  103. Ful ofte a day she sighte eek for destresse,                     715\r\n  And in hir-self she wente ay portrayinge\r\n  Of Troilus the grete worthinesse,\r\n  And alle his goodly wordes recordinge\r\n  Sin first that day hir love bigan to springe.\r\n  And thus she sette hir woful herte a-fyre                             720\r\n  Thorugh remembraunce of that she gan desyre.\r\n\r\n  104. In al this world ther nis so cruel herte\r\n  That hir hadde herd compleynen in hir sorwe,\r\n  That nolde han wopen for hir peynes smerte,\r\n  So tendrely she weep, bothe eve and morwe.                            725\r\n  Hir nedede no teres for to borwe.\r\n  And this was yet the worste of al hir peyne,\r\n  Ther was no wight to whom she dorste hir pleyne.\r\n\r\n  105. Ful rewfully she loked up-on Troye,\r\n  Biheld the toures heighe and eek the halles;                          730\r\n  'Allas!' quod she, 'the plesaunce and the Ioye\r\n  The whiche that now al torned in-to galle is,\r\n  Have I had ofte with-inne yonder walles!\r\n  O Troilus, what dostow now,' she seyde;\r\n  'Lord! whether yet thou thenke up-on Criseyde?                        735\r\n\r\n  106. Allas! I ne hadde trowed on your lore,\r\n  And went with yow, as ye me radde er this!\r\n  Thanne hadde I now not syked half so sore.\r\n  Who mighte have seyd, that I had doon a-mis\r\n  To stele awey with swich on as he is?                                 740\r\n  But al to late cometh the letuarie,\r\n  Whan men the cors un-to the grave carie.\r\n\r\n  107. To late is now to speke of this matere;\r\n  Prudence, allas! oon of thyn eyen three\r\n  Me lakked alwey, er that I cam here;                                  745\r\n  On tyme y-passed, wel remembred me;\r\n  And present tyme eek coude I wel y-see.\r\n  But futur tyme, er I was in the snare,\r\n  Coude I not seen; that causeth now my care.\r\n\r\n  108. But natheles, bityde what bityde,                                750\r\n  I shal to-morwe at night, by est or weste,\r\n  Out of this ost stele on som maner syde,\r\n  And go with Troilus wher-as him leste.\r\n  This purpos wol I holde, and this is beste.\r\n  No fors of wikked tonges Ianglerye,                                   755\r\n  For ever on love han wrecches had envye.\r\n\r\n  109. For who-so wole of every word take hede,\r\n  Or rewlen him by every wightes wit,\r\n  Ne shal he never thryven, out of drede.\r\n  For that that som men blamen ever yit,                                760\r\n  Lo, other maner folk commenden it.\r\n  And as for me, for al swich variaunce,\r\n  Felicitee clepe I my suffisaunce.\r\n\r\n  110. For which, with-outen any wordes mo,\r\n  To Troye I wol, as for conclusioun.'                                  765\r\n  But god it wot, er fully monthes two,\r\n  She was ful fer fro that entencioun.\r\n  For bothe Troilus and Troye toun\r\n  Shal knotteles through-out hir herte slyde;\r\n  For she wol take a purpos for tabyde.                                 770\r\n\r\n  111. This Diomede, of whom yow telle I gan,\r\n  Goth now, with-inne him-self ay arguinge\r\n  With al the sleighte and al that ever he can,\r\n  How he may best, with shortest taryinge,\r\n  In-to his net Criseydes herte bringe.                                 775\r\n  To this entente he coude never fyne;\r\n  To fisshen hir, he leyde out hook and lyne.\r\n\r\n  112. But natheles, wel in his herte he thoughte,\r\n  That she nas nat with-oute a love in Troye.\r\n  For never, sithen he hir thennes broughte,                            780\r\n  Ne coude he seen her laughe or make Ioye.\r\n  He niste how best hir herte for tacoye.\r\n  'But for to assaye,' he seyde, 'it nought ne greveth;\r\n  For he that nought nassayeth, nought nacheveth.'\r\n\r\n  113. Yet seide he to him-self upon a night,                           785\r\n  'Now am I not a fool, that woot wel how\r\n  Hir wo for love is of another wight,\r\n  And here-up-on to goon assaye hir now?\r\n  I may wel wite, it nil not been my prow.\r\n  For wyse folk in bokes it expresse,                                   790\r\n  \"Men shal not wowe a wight in hevinesse.\"\r\n\r\n  114. But who-so mighte winnen swich a flour\r\n  From him, for whom she morneth night and day,\r\n  He mighte seyn, he were a conquerour.'\r\n  And right anoon, as he that bold was ay,                              795\r\n  Thoughte in his herte, 'happe, how happe may,\r\n  Al sholde I deye, I wole hir herte seche;\r\n  I shal no more lesen but my speche.'\r\n\r\n  115. This Diomede, as bokes us declare,\r\n  Was in his nedes prest and corageous;                                 800\r\n  With sterne voys and mighty limes square,\r\n  Hardy, testif, strong, and chevalrous\r\n  Of dedes, lyk his fader Tideus.\r\n  And som men seyn, he was of tunge large;\r\n  And heir he was of Calidoine and Arge.                                805\r\n\r\n  116. Criseyde mene was of hir stature,\r\n  Ther-to of shap, of face, and eek of chere,\r\n  Ther mighte been no fairer creature.\r\n  And ofte tyme this was hir manere,\r\n  To gon y-tressed with hir heres clere                                 810\r\n  Doun by hir coler at hir bak bihinde,\r\n  Which with a threde of gold she wolde binde.\r\n\r\n  117. And, save hir browes ioyneden y-fere,\r\n  Ther nas no lak, in ought I can espyen;\r\n  But for to speken of hir eyen clere,                                  815\r\n  Lo, trewely, they writen that hir syen,\r\n  That Paradys stood formed in hir yën.\r\n  And with hir riche beautee ever-more\r\n  Strof love in hir, ay which of hem was more.\r\n\r\n  118. She sobre was, eek simple, and wys with-al,                      820\r\n  The beste y-norisshed eek that mighte be,\r\n  And goodly of hir speche in general,\r\n  Charitable, estatliche, lusty, and free;\r\n  Ne never-mo ne lakkede hir pitee;\r\n  Tendre-herted, slydinge of corage;                                    825\r\n  But trewely, I can not telle hir age.\r\n\r\n  119. And Troilus wel waxen was in highte,\r\n  And complet formed by proporcioun\r\n  So wel, that kinde it not amenden mighte;\r\n  Yong, fresshe, strong, and hardy as lyoun;                            830\r\n  Trewe as steel in ech condicioun;\r\n  On of the beste enteched creature,\r\n  That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure.\r\n\r\n  120. And certainly in storie it is y-founde,\r\n  That Troilus was never un-to no wight,                                835\r\n  As in his tyme, in no degree secounde\r\n  In durring don that longeth to a knight.\r\n  Al mighte a geaunt passen him of might,\r\n  His herte ay with the firste and with the beste\r\n  Stod paregal, to durre don that him leste.                            840\r\n\r\n  121. But for to tellen forth of Diomede:--\r\n  It fil that after, on the tenthe day,\r\n  Sin that Criseyde out of the citee yede,\r\n  This Diomede, as fresshe as braunche in May,\r\n  Com to the tente ther-as Calkas lay,                                  845\r\n  And feyned him with Calkas han to done;\r\n  But what he mente, I shal yow telle sone.\r\n\r\n  122. Criseyde, at shorte wordes for to telle,\r\n  Welcomed him, and doun by hir him sette;\r\n  And he was ethe y-nough to maken dwelle.                              850\r\n  And after this, with-outen longe lette,\r\n  The spyces and the wyn men forth hem fette;\r\n  And forth they speke of this and that y-fere,\r\n  As freendes doon, of which som shal ye here.\r\n\r\n  123. He gan first fallen of the werre in speche                       855\r\n  Bitwixe hem and the folk of Troye toun;\r\n  And of thassege he gan hir eek byseche,\r\n  To telle him what was hir opinioun.\r\n  Fro that demaunde he so descendeth doun\r\n  To asken hir, if that hir straunge thoughte                           860\r\n  The Grekes gyse, and werkes that they wroughte?\r\n\r\n  124. And why hir fader tarieth so longe\r\n  To wedden hir un-to som worthy wight?\r\n  Criseyde, that was in hir peynes stronge\r\n  For love of Troilus, hir owene knight,                                865\r\n  As fer-forth as she conning hadde or might,\r\n  Answerde him tho; but, as of his entente,\r\n  It semed not she wiste what he mente.\r\n\r\n  125. But natheles, this ilke Diomede\r\n  Gan in him-self assure, and thus he seyde,                            870\r\n  'If ich aright have taken of yow hede,\r\n  Me thinketh thus, O lady myn, Criseyde,\r\n  That sin I first hond on your brydel leyde,\r\n  Whan ye out come of Troye by the morwe,\r\n  Ne coude I never seen yow but in sorwe.                               875\r\n\r\n  126. Can I not seyn what may the cause be\r\n  But-if for love of som Troyan it were,\r\n  The which right sore wolde athinken me\r\n  That ye, for any wight that dwelleth there,\r\n  Sholden spille a quarter of a tere,                                   880\r\n  Or pitously your-selven so bigyle;\r\n  For dredelees, it is nought worth the whyle.\r\n\r\n  127. The folk of Troye, as who seyth, alle and some\r\n  In preson been, as ye your-selven see;\r\n  For thennes shal not oon on-lyve come                                 885\r\n  For al the gold bitwixen sonne and see.\r\n  Trusteth wel, and understondeth me,\r\n  Ther shal not oon to mercy goon on-lyve,\r\n  Al were he lord of worldes twyës fyve!\r\n\r\n  128. Swich wreche on hem, for fecching of Eleyne,                     890\r\n  Ther shal be take, er that we hennes wende,\r\n  That Manes, which that goddes ben of peyne,\r\n  Shal been agast that Grekes wol hem shende.\r\n  And men shul drede, un-to the worldes ende,\r\n  From hennes-forth to ravisshe any quene,                              895\r\n  So cruel shal our wreche on hem be sene.\r\n\r\n  129. And but-if Calkas lede us with ambages,\r\n  That is to seyn, with double wordes slye,\r\n  Swich as men clepe a \"word with two visages,\"\r\n  Ye shul wel knowen that I nought ne lye,                              900\r\n  And al this thing right seen it with your yë,\r\n  And that anoon; ye nil not trowe how sone;\r\n  Now taketh heed, for it is for to done.\r\n\r\n  130. What wene ye your wyse fader wolde\r\n  Han yeven Antenor for yow anoon,                                      905\r\n  If he ne wiste that the citee sholde\r\n  Destroyed been? Why, nay, so mote I goon!\r\n  He knew ful wel ther shal not scapen oon\r\n  That Troyan is; and for the grete fere,\r\n  He dorste not, ye dwelte lenger there.                                910\r\n\r\n  131. What wole ye more, lufsom lady dere?\r\n  Lat Troye and Troyan fro your herte pace!\r\n  Dryf out that bittre hope, and make good chere,\r\n  And clepe ayein the beautee of your face,\r\n  That ye with salte teres so deface.                                   915\r\n  For Troye is brought in swich a Iupartye,\r\n  That, it to save, is now no remedye.\r\n\r\n  132. And thenketh wel, ye shal in Grekes finde,\r\n  A more parfit love, er it be night,\r\n  Than any Troyan is, and more kinde,                                   920\r\n  And bet to serven yow wol doon his might.\r\n  And if ye vouche sauf, my lady bright,\r\n  I wol ben he to serven yow my-selve,\r\n  Ye, lever than be lord of Greces twelve!'\r\n\r\n  133. And with that word he gan to waxen reed,                         925\r\n  And in his speche a litel wight he quook,\r\n  And caste a-syde a litel wight his heed,\r\n  And stinte a whyle; and afterward awook,\r\n  And sobreliche on hir he threw his look,\r\n  And seyde, 'I am, al be it yow no Ioye,                               930\r\n  As gentil man as any wight in Troye.\r\n\r\n  134. For if my fader Tydeus,' he seyde,\r\n  'Y-lived hadde, I hadde been, er this,\r\n  Of Calidoine and Arge a king, Criseyde!\r\n  And so hope I that I shal yet, y-wis.                                 935\r\n  But he was slayn, allas! the more harm is,\r\n  Unhappily at Thebes al to rathe,\r\n  Polymites and many a man to scathe.\r\n\r\n  135. But herte myn, sin that I am your man,\r\n  And been the ferste of whom I seche grace,                            940\r\n  To serven you as hertely as I can,\r\n  And ever shal, whyl I to live have space,\r\n  So, er that I departe out of this place,\r\n  Ye wol me graunte, that I may to-morwe,\r\n  At bettre leyser, telle yow my sorwe.'                                945\r\n\r\n  136. What shold I telle his wordes that he seyde?\r\n  He spak y-now, for o day at the meste;\r\n  It preveth wel, he spak so that Criseyde\r\n  Graunted, on the morwe, at his requeste,\r\n  For to speken with him at the leste,                                  950\r\n  So that he nolde speke of swich matere;\r\n  And thus to him she seyde, as ye may here:\r\n\r\n  137. As she that hadde hir herte on Troilus\r\n  So faste, that ther may it noon arace;\r\n  And straungely she spak, and seyde thus:                              955\r\n  'O Diomede, I love that ilke place\r\n  Ther I was born; and Ioves, for his grace,\r\n  Delivere it sone of al that doth it care!\r\n  God, for thy might, so leve it wel to fare!\r\n\r\n  138. That Grekes wolde hir wraththe on Troye wreke,                   960\r\n  If that they mighte, I knowe it wel, y-wis.\r\n  But it shal not bifallen as ye speke;\r\n  And god to-forn, and ferther over this,\r\n  I wot my fader wys and redy is;\r\n  And that he me hath bought, as ye me tolde,                           965\r\n  So dere, I am the more un-to him holde.\r\n\r\n  139. That Grekes been of heigh condicioun,\r\n  I woot eek wel; but certein, men shal finde\r\n  As worthy folk with-inne Troye toun,\r\n  As conning, and as parfit and as kinde,                               970\r\n  As been bitwixen Orcades and Inde.\r\n  And that ye coude wel your lady serve,\r\n  I trowe eek wel, hir thank for to deserve.\r\n\r\n  140. But as to speke of love, y-wis,' she seyde,\r\n  'I hadde a lord, to whom I wedded was,                                975\r\n  The whos myn herte al was, til that he deyde;\r\n  And other love, as helpe me now Pallas,\r\n  Ther in myn herte nis, ne never was.\r\n  And that ye been of noble and heigh kinrede,\r\n  I have wel herd it tellen, out of drede.                              980\r\n\r\n  141. And that doth me to han so gret a wonder,\r\n  That ye wol scornen any womman so.\r\n  Eek, god wot, love and I be fer a-sonder;\r\n  I am disposed bet, so mote I go,\r\n  Un-to my deeth, to pleyne and maken wo.                               985\r\n  What I shal after doon, I can not seye;\r\n  But trewely, as yet me list not pleye.\r\n\r\n  142. Myn herte is now in tribulacioun,\r\n  And ye in armes bisy, day by day.\r\n  Here-after, whan ye wonnen han the toun,                              990\r\n  Paraunter, thanne so it happen may,\r\n  That whan I see that I never er say,\r\n  Than wole I werke that I never wroughte!\r\n  This word to yow y-nough suffysen oughte.\r\n\r\n  143. To-morwe eek wol I speke with yow fayn,                          995\r\n  So that ye touchen nought of this matere.\r\n  And whan yow list, ye may come here ayeyn;\r\n  And, er ye gon, thus muche I seye yow here:\r\n  As helpe me Pallas with hir heres clere,\r\n  If that I sholde of any Greek han routhe,                            1000\r\n  It sholde be your-selven, by my trouthe!\r\n\r\n  144. I sey not therfore that I wol yow love,\r\n  Ne I sey not nay, but in conclusioun,\r\n  I mene wel, by god that sit above:'--\r\n  And ther-with-al she caste hir eyen doun,                            1005\r\n  And gan to syke, and seyde, 'O Troye toun,\r\n  Yet bidde I god, in quiete and in reste\r\n  I may yow seen, or do myn herte breste.'\r\n\r\n  145. But in effect, and shortly for to seye,\r\n  This Diomede al freshly newe ayeyn                                   1010\r\n  Gan pressen on, and faste hir mercy preye;\r\n  And after this, the sothe for to seyn,\r\n  Hir glove he took, of which he was ful fayn.\r\n  And fynally, whan it was waxen eve,\r\n  And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.                           1015\r\n\r\n  146. The brighte Venus folwede and ay taughte\r\n  The wey, ther brode Phebus doun alighte;\r\n  And Cynthea hir char-hors over-raughte\r\n  To whirle out of the Lyon, if she mighte;\r\n  And Signifer his candeles shewed brighte,                            1020\r\n  Whan that Criseyde un-to hir bedde wente\r\n  In-with hir fadres faire brighte tente.\r\n\r\n  147. Retorning in hir soule ay up and doun\r\n  The wordes of this sodein Diomede,\r\n  His greet estat, and peril of the toun,                              1025\r\n  And that she was allone and hadde nede\r\n  Of freendes help; and thus bigan to brede\r\n  The cause why, the sothe for to telle,\r\n  That she tok fully purpos for to dwelle.\r\n\r\n  148. The morwe com, and goostly for to speke,                        1030\r\n  This Diomede is come un-to Criseyde,\r\n  And shortly, lest that ye my tale breke,\r\n  So wel he for him-selve spak and seyde,\r\n  That alle hir sykes sore adoun he leyde.\r\n  And fynally, the sothe for to seyne,                                 1035\r\n  He refte hir of the grete of al hir peyne.\r\n\r\n  149. And after this the story telleth us,\r\n  That she him yaf the faire baye stede,\r\n  The which he ones wan of Troilus;\r\n  And eek a broche (and that was litel nede)                           1040\r\n  That Troilus was, she yaf this Diomede.\r\n  And eek, the bet from sorwe him to releve,\r\n  She made him were a pencel of hir sleve.\r\n\r\n  150. I finde eek in the stories elles-where,\r\n  Whan through the body hurt was Diomede                               1045\r\n  Of Troilus, tho weep she many a tere,\r\n  Whan that she saugh his wyde woundes blede;\r\n  And that she took to kepen him good hede,\r\n  And for to hele him of his sorwes smerte.\r\n  Men seyn, I not, that she yaf him hir herte.                         1050\r\n\r\n  151. But trewely, the story telleth us,\r\n  Ther made never womman more wo\r\n  Than she, whan that she falsed Troilus.\r\n  She seyde, 'allas! for now is clene a-go\r\n  My name of trouthe in love, for ever-mo!                             1055\r\n  For I have falsed oon, the gentileste\r\n  That ever was, and oon the worthieste!\r\n\r\n  152. Allas, of me, un-to the worldes ende,\r\n  Shal neither been y-writen nor y-songe\r\n  No good word, for thise bokes wol me shende.                         1060\r\n  O, rolled shal I been on many a tonge;\r\n  Through-out the world my belle shal be ronge;\r\n  And wommen most wol hate me of alle.\r\n  Allas, that swich a cas me sholde falle!\r\n\r\n  153. They wol seyn, in as muche as in me is,                         1065\r\n  I have hem don dishonour, weylawey!\r\n  Al be I not the firste that dide amis,\r\n  What helpeth that to do my blame awey?\r\n  But sin I see there is no bettre way,\r\n  And that to late is now for me to rewe,                              1070\r\n  To Diomede algate I wol be trewe.\r\n\r\n  154. But Troilus, sin I no better may,\r\n  And sin that thus departen ye and I,\r\n  Yet preye I god, so yeve yow right good day\r\n  As for the gentileste, trewely,                                      1075\r\n  That ever I say, to serven feithfully,\r\n  And best can ay his lady honour kepe:'--\r\n  And with that word she brast anon to wepe.\r\n\r\n  155. 'And certes, yow ne haten shal I never,\r\n  And freendes love, that shal ye han of me,                           1080\r\n  And my good word, al mighte I liven ever.\r\n  And, trewely, I wolde sory be\r\n  For to seen yow in adversitee.\r\n  And giltelees, I woot wel, I yow leve;\r\n  But al shal passe; and thus take I my leve.'                         1085\r\n\r\n  156. But trewely, how longe it was bitwene,\r\n  That she for-sook him for this Diomede,\r\n  Ther is non auctor telleth it, I wene.\r\n  Take every man now to his bokes hede;\r\n  He shal no terme finden, out of drede.                               1090\r\n  For though that he bigan to wowe hir sone,\r\n  Er he hir wan, yet was ther more to done.\r\n\r\n  157. Ne me ne list this sely womman chyde\r\n  Ferther than the story wol devyse.\r\n  Hir name, allas! is publisshed so wyde,                              1095\r\n  That for hir gilt it oughte y-now suffyse.\r\n  And if I mighte excuse hir any wyse,\r\n  For she so sory was for hir untrouthe,\r\n  Y-wis, I wolde excuse hir yet for routhe.\r\n\r\n  158. This Troilus, as I biforn have told,                            1100\r\n  Thus dryveth forth, as wel as he hath might.\r\n  But often was his herte hoot and cold,\r\n  And namely, that ilke nynthe night,\r\n  Which on the morwe she hadde him byhight\r\n  To come ayein: god wot, ful litel reste                              1105\r\n  Hadde he that night; no-thing to slepe him leste.\r\n\r\n  159. The laurer-crouned Phebus, with his hete,\r\n  Gan, in his course ay upward as he wente,\r\n  To warmen of the est see the wawes wete;\r\n  And Nisus doughter song with fresh entente,                          1110\r\n  Whan Troilus his Pandare after sente;\r\n  And on the walles of the toun they pleyde,\r\n  To loke if they can seen ought of Criseyde.\r\n\r\n  160. Til it was noon, they stoden for to see\r\n  Who that ther come; and every maner wight,                           1115\r\n  That cam fro fer, they seyden it was she,\r\n  Til that they coude knowen him a-right.\r\n  Now was his herte dul, now was it light;\r\n  And thus by-iaped stonden for to stare\r\n  Aboute nought, this Troilus and Pandare.                             1120\r\n\r\n  161. To Pandarus this Troilus tho seyde,\r\n  'For ought I wot, bi-for noon, sikerly,\r\n  In-to this toun ne comth nought here Criseyde.\r\n  She hath y-now to done, hardily,\r\n  To winnen from hir fader, so trowe I;                                1125\r\n  Hir olde fader wol yet make hir dyne\r\n  Er that she go; god yeve his herte pyne!'\r\n\r\n  162. Pandare answerde, 'it may wel be, certeyn;\r\n  And for-thy lat us dyne, I thee biseche;\r\n  And after noon than mayst thou come ayeyn.'                          1130\r\n  And hoom they go, with-oute more speche;\r\n  And comen ayein, but longe may they seche\r\n  Er that they finde that they after cape;\r\n  Fortune hem bothe thenketh for to Iape.\r\n\r\n  163. Quod Troilus, 'I see wel now, that she                          1135\r\n  Is taried with hir olde fader so,\r\n  That er she come, it wol neigh even be.\r\n  Com forth, I wol un-to the yate go.\r\n  Thise portours been unkonninge ever-mo;\r\n  And I wol doon hem holden up the yate                                1140\r\n  As nought ne were, al-though she come late.'\r\n\r\n  164. The day goth faste, and after that comth eve,\r\n  And yet com nought to Troilus Criseyde.\r\n  He loketh forth by hegge, by tree, by greve,\r\n  And fer his heed over the wal he leyde.                              1145\r\n  And at the laste he torned him, and seyde,\r\n  'By god, I woot hir mening now, Pandare!\r\n  Al-most, y-wis, al newe was my care.\r\n\r\n  165. Now douteles, this lady can hir good;\r\n  I woot, she meneth ryden prively.                                    1150\r\n  I comende hir wysdom, by myn hood!\r\n  She wol not maken peple nycely\r\n  Gaure on hir, whan she comth; but softely\r\n  By nighte in-to the toun she thenketh ryde.\r\n  And, dere brother, thenk not longe to abyde.                         1155\r\n\r\n  166. We han nought elles for to don, y-wis.\r\n  And Pandarus, now woltow trowen me?\r\n  Have here my trouthe, I see hir! yond she is.\r\n  Heve up thyn eyen, man! maystow not see?'\r\n  Pandare answerde, 'nay, so mote I thee!                              1160\r\n  Al wrong, by god; what seystow, man, wher art?\r\n  That I see yond nis but a fare-cart.'\r\n\r\n  167. 'Allas, thou seist right sooth,' quod Troilus;\r\n  'But hardely, it is not al for nought\r\n  That in myn herte I now reioyse thus.                                1165\r\n  It is ayein som good I have a thought.\r\n  Noot I not how, but sin that I was wrought,\r\n  Ne felte I swich a confort, dar I seye;\r\n  She comth to-night, my lyf, that dorste I leye!'\r\n\r\n  168. Pandare answerde, 'it may be wel, y-nough';                     1170\r\n  And held with him of al that ever he seyde;\r\n  But in his herte he thoughte, and softe lough,\r\n  And to him-self ful sobrely he seyde:\r\n  'From hasel-wode, ther Ioly Robin pleyde,\r\n  Shal come al that that thou abydest here;                            1175\r\n  Ye, fare-wel al the snow of ferne yere!'\r\n\r\n  169. The wardein of the yates gan to calle\r\n  The folk which that with-oute the yates were,\r\n  And bad hem dryven in hir bestes alle,\r\n  Or al the night they moste bleven there.                             1180\r\n  And fer with-in the night, with many a tere,\r\n  This Troilus gan hoomward for to ryde;\r\n  For wel he seeth it helpeth nought tabyde.\r\n\r\n  170. But natheles, he gladded him in this;\r\n  He thoughte he misacounted hadde his day,                            1185\r\n  And seyde, 'I understonde have al a-mis.\r\n  For thilke night I last Criseyde say,\r\n  She seyde, \"I shal ben here, if that I may,\r\n  Er that the mone, O dere herte swete!\r\n  The Lyon passe, out of this Ariete.\"                                 1190\r\n\r\n  171. For which she may yet holde al hir biheste.'\r\n  And on the morwe un-to the yate he wente,\r\n  And up and down, by west and eek by este,\r\n  Up-on the walles made he many a wente.\r\n  But al for nought; his hope alwey him blente;                        1195\r\n  For which at night, in sorwe and sykes sore\r\n  He wente him hoom, with-outen any more.\r\n\r\n  172. This hope al clene out of his herte fledde,\r\n  He nath wher-on now lenger for to honge;\r\n  But for the peyne him thoughte his herte bledde,                     1200\r\n  So were his throwes sharpe and wonder stronge.\r\n  For when he saugh that she abood so longe,\r\n  He niste what he iuggen of it mighte,\r\n  Sin she hath broken that she him bihighte.\r\n\r\n  173. The thridde, ferthe, fifte, sixte day                           1205\r\n  After tho dayes ten, of which I tolde,\r\n  Bitwixen hope and drede his herte lay,\r\n  Yet som-what trustinge on hir hestes olde.\r\n  But whan he saugh she nolde hir terme holde,\r\n  He can now seen non other remedye,                                   1210\r\n  But for to shape him sone for to dye.\r\n\r\n  174. Ther-with the wikked spirit, god us blesse,\r\n  Which that men clepeth wode Ialousye,\r\n  Gan in him crepe, in al this hevinesse;\r\n  For which, by-cause he wolde sone dye,                               1215\r\n  He ne eet ne dronk, for his malencolye,\r\n  And eek from every companye he fledde;\r\n  This was the lyf that al the tyme he ledde.\r\n\r\n  175.

Cassandre goth, and he with cruel herte\r\n  For-yat his wo, for angre of hir speche;                             1535\r\n  And from his bed al sodeinly he sterte,\r\n  As though al hool him hadde y-mad a leche.\r\n  And day by day he gan enquere and seche\r\n  A sooth of this, with al his fulle cure;\r\n  And thus he dryeth forth his aventure.                               1540\r\n\r\n  221. Fortune, whiche that permutacioun\r\n  Of thinges hath, as it is hir committed\r\n  Through purveyaunce and disposicioun\r\n  Of heighe Iove, as regnes shal ben flitted\r\n  Fro folk in folk, or whan they shal ben smitted,                     1545\r\n  Gan pulle awey the fetheres brighte of Troye\r\n  Fro day to day, til they ben bare of Ioye.\r\n\r\n  222. Among al this, the fyn of the parodie\r\n  Of Ector gan approchen wonder blyve;\r\n  The fate wolde his soule sholde unbodie,                             1550\r\n  And shapen hadde a mene it out to dryve;\r\n  Ayeins which fate him helpeth not to stryve;\r\n  But on a day to fighten gan he wende,\r\n  At which, allas! he caughte his lyves ende.\r\n\r\n  223. For which me thinketh every maner wight                         1555\r\n  That haunteth armes oughte to biwayle\r\n  The deeth of him that was so noble a knight;\r\n  For as he drough a king by thaventayle,\r\n  Unwar of this, Achilles through the mayle\r\n  And through the body gan him for to ryve;                            1560\r\n  And thus this worthy knight was brought of lyve.\r\n\r\n  224. For whom, as olde bokes tellen us,\r\n  Was mad swich wo, that tonge it may not telle;\r\n  And namely, the sorwe of Troilus,\r\n  That next him was of worthinesse welle.                              1565\r\n  And in this wo gan Troilus to dwelle,\r\n  That, what for sorwe, and love, and for unreste,\r\n  Ful ofte a day he bad his herte breste.\r\n\r\n  225. But natheles, though he gan him dispeyre,\r\n  And dradde ay that his lady was untrewe,                             1570\r\n  Yet ay on hir his herte gan repeyre.\r\n  And as these loveres doon, he soughte ay newe\r\n  To gete ayein Criseyde, bright of hewe.\r\n  And in his herte he wente hir excusinge,\r\n  That Calkas causede al hir taryinge.                                 1575\r\n\r\n  226. And ofte tyme he was in purpos grete\r\n  Him-selven lyk a pilgrim to disgyse,\r\n  To seen hir; but he may not contrefete\r\n  To been unknowen of folk that weren wyse,\r\n  Ne finde excuse aright that may suffyse,                             1580\r\n  If he among the Grekes knowen were;\r\n  For which he weep ful ofte many a tere.\r\n\r\n  227. To hir he wroot yet ofte tyme al newe\r\n  Ful pitously, he lefte it nought for slouthe,\r\n  Biseching hir that, sin that he was trewe,                           1585\r\n  She wolde come ayein and holde hir trouthe.\r\n  For which Criseyde up-on a day, for routhe,\r\n  I take it so, touchinge al this matere,\r\n  Wrot him ayein, and seyde as ye may here.\r\n\r\n  228.

But natheles, men seyn that, at the laste,\r\n  For any thing, men shal the sothe see;                               1640\r\n  And swich a cas bitidde, and that as faste,\r\n  That Troilus wel understood that she\r\n  Nas not so kinde as that hir oughte be.\r\n  And fynally, he woot now, out of doute,\r\n  That al is lost that he hath been aboute.                            1645\r\n\r\n  236. Stood on a day in his malencolye\r\n  This Troilus, and in suspecioun\r\n  Of hir for whom he wende for to dye.\r\n  And so bifel, that through-out Troye toun,\r\n  As was the gyse, y-bore was up and doun                              1650\r\n  A maner cote-armure, as seyth the storie,\r\n  Biforn Deiphebe, in signe of his victorie,\r\n\r\n  237. The whiche cote, as telleth Lollius,\r\n  Deiphebe it hadde y-rent from Diomede\r\n  The same day; and whan this Troilus                                  1655\r\n  It saugh, he gan to taken of it hede,\r\n  Avysing of the lengthe and of the brede,\r\n  And al the werk; but as he gan biholde,\r\n  Ful sodeinly his herte gan to colde,\r\n\r\n  238. As he that on the coler fond with-inne                          1660\r\n  A broche, that he Criseyde yaf that morwe\r\n  That she from Troye moste nedes twinne,\r\n  In remembraunce of him and of his sorwe;\r\n  And she him leyde ayein hir feyth to borwe\r\n  To kepe it ay; but now, ful wel he wiste,                            1665\r\n  His lady nas no lenger on to triste.\r\n\r\n  239. He gooth him hoom, and gan ful sone sende\r\n  For Pandarus; and al this newe chaunce,\r\n  And of this broche, he tolde him word and ende,\r\n  Compleyninge of hir hertes variaunce,                                1670\r\n  His longe love, his trouthe, and his penaunce;\r\n  And after deeth, with-outen wordes more,\r\n  Ful faste he cryde, his reste him to restore.\r\n\r\n  240. Than spak he thus, 'O lady myn Criseyde,\r\n  Wher is your feyth, and wher is your biheste?                        1675\r\n  Wher is your love, wher is your trouthe,' he seyde;\r\n  'Of Diomede have ye now al this feste!\r\n  Allas, I wolde have trowed at the leste,\r\n  That, sin ye nolde in trouthe to me stonde,\r\n  That ye thus nolde han holden me in honde!                           1680\r\n\r\n  241. Who shal now trowe on any othes mo?\r\n  Allas, I never wolde han wend, er this,\r\n  That ye, Criseyde, coude han chaunged so;\r\n  Ne, but I hadde a-gilt and doon amis,\r\n  So cruel wende I not your herte, y-wis,                              1685\r\n  To slee me thus; allas, your name of trouthe\r\n  Is now for-doon, and that is al my routhe.\r\n\r\n  242. Was ther non other broche yow liste lete\r\n  To feffe with your newe love,' quod he,\r\n  'But thilke broche that I, with teres wete,                          1690\r\n  Yow yaf, as for a remembraunce of me?\r\n  Non other cause, allas, ne hadde ye\r\n  But for despyt, and eek for that ye mente\r\n  Al-outrely to shewen your entente!\r\n\r\n  243.

Now god,' quod he, 'me sende yet the grace\r\n  That I may meten with this Diomede!\r\n  And trewely, if I have might and space,\r\n  Yet shal I make, I hope, his sydes blede.                            1705\r\n  O god,' quod he, 'that oughtest taken hede\r\n  To fortheren trouthe, and wronges to punyce,\r\n  Why niltow doon a vengeaunce on this vyce?\r\n\r\n  245. O Pandare, that in dremes for to triste\r\n  Me blamed hast, and wont art ofte up-breyde,                         1710\r\n  Now maystow see thy-selve, if that thee liste,\r\n  How trewe is now thy nece, bright Criseyde!\r\n  In sondry formes, god it woot,' he seyde,\r\n  'The goddes shewen bothe Ioye and tene\r\n  In slepe, and by my dreme it is now sene.                            1715\r\n\r\n  246. And certaynly, with-oute more speche,\r\n  From hennes-forth, as ferforth as I may,\r\n  Myn owene deeth in armes wol I seche;\r\n  I recche not how sone be the day!\r\n  But trewely, Criseyde, swete may,                                    1720\r\n  Whom I have ay with al my might y-served,\r\n  That ye thus doon, I have it nought deserved.'\r\n\r\n  247. This Pandarus, that alle these thinges herde,\r\n  And wiste wel he seyde a sooth of this,\r\n  He nought a word ayein to him answerde;                              1725\r\n  For sory of his frendes sorwe he is,\r\n  And shamed, for his nece hath doon a-mis;\r\n  And stant, astoned of these causes tweye,\r\n  As stille as stoon; a word ne coude he seye.\r\n\r\n  248. But at the laste thus he spak, and seyde,                       1730\r\n  'My brother dere, I may thee do no-more.\r\n  What shulde I seyn? I hate, y-wis, Criseyde!\r\n  And god wot, I wol hate hir evermore!\r\n  And that thou me bisoughtest doon of yore,\r\n  Havinge un-to myn honour ne my reste                                 1735\r\n  Right no reward, I dide al that thee leste.\r\n\r\n  249. If I dide ought that mighte lyken thee,\r\n  It is me leef; and of this treson now,\r\n  God woot, that it a sorwe is un-to me!\r\n  And dredelees, for hertes ese of yow,                                1740\r\n  Right fayn wolde I amende it, wiste I how.\r\n  And fro this world, almighty god I preye,\r\n  Delivere hir sone; I can no-more seye.'\r\n\r\n  250. Gret was the sorwe and pleynt of Troilus;\r\n  But forth hir cours fortune ay gan to holde.                         1745\r\n  Criseyde loveth the sone of Tydeus,\r\n  And Troilus mot wepe in cares colde.\r\n  Swich is this world; who-so it can biholde,\r\n  In eche estat is litel hertes reste;\r\n  God leve us for to take it for the beste!                            1750\r\n\r\n  251. In many cruel batayle, out of drede,\r\n  Of Troilus, this ilke noble knight,\r\n  As men may in these olde bokes rede,\r\n  Was sene his knighthod and his grete might.\r\n  And dredelees, his ire, day and night,                               1755\r\n  Ful cruelly the Grekes ay aboughte;\r\n  And alwey most this Diomede he soughte.\r\n\r\n  252. And ofte tyme, I finde that they mette\r\n  With blody strokes and with wordes grete,\r\n  Assayinge how hir speres weren whette;                               1760\r\n  And god it woot, with many a cruel hete\r\n  Gan Troilus upon his helm to-bete.\r\n  But natheles, fortune it nought ne wolde,\r\n  Of otheres hond that either deyen sholde.--\r\n\r\n  253. And if I hadde y-taken for to wryte                             1765\r\n  The armes of this ilke worthy man,\r\n  Than wolde I of his batailles endyte.\r\n  But for that I to wryte first bigan\r\n  Of his love, I have seyd as that I can.\r\n  His worthy dedes, who-so list hem here,                              1770\r\n  Reed Dares, he can telle hem alle y-fere.\r\n\r\n  254. Bisechinge every lady bright of hewe,\r\n  And every gentil womman, what she be,\r\n  That al be that Criseyde was untrewe,\r\n  That for that gilt she be not wrooth with me.                        1775\r\n  Ye may hir gilt in othere bokes see;\r\n  And gladlier I wol wryten, if yow leste,\r\n  Penelopeës trouthe and good Alceste.\r\n\r\n  255. Ne I sey not this al-only for these men,\r\n  But most for wommen that bitraysed be                                1780\r\n  Through false folk; god yeve hem sorwe, amen!\r\n  That with hir grete wit and subtiltee\r\n  Bitrayse yow! and this commeveth me\r\n  To speke, and in effect yow alle I preye,\r\n  Beth war of men, and herkeneth what I seye!--                        1785\r\n\r\n  256. Go, litel book, go litel myn tregedie,\r\n  Ther god thy maker yet, er that he dye,\r\n  So sende might to make in som comedie!\r\n  But litel book, no making thou nenvye,\r\n  But subgit be to alle poesye;                                        1790\r\n  And kis the steppes, wher-as thou seest pace\r\n  Virgile, Ovyde, Omer, Lucan, and Stace.\r\n\r\n  257. And for ther is so greet diversitee\r\n  In English and in wryting of our tonge,\r\n  So preye I god that noon miswryte thee,                              1795\r\n  Ne thee mismetre for defaute of tonge.\r\n  And red wher-so thou be, or elles songe,\r\n  That thou be understonde I god beseche!\r\n  But yet to purpos of my rather speche.--\r\n\r\n  258. The wraththe, as I began yow for to seye,                       1800\r\n  Of Troilus, the Grekes boughten dere;\r\n  For thousandes his hondes maden deye,\r\n  As he that was with-outen any pere,\r\n  Save Ector, in his tyme, as I can here.\r\n  But weylaway, save only goddes wille,                                1805\r\n  Dispitously him slough the fiers Achille.\r\n\r\n  259. And whan that he was slayn in this manere,\r\n  His lighte goost ful blisfully is went\r\n  Up to the holownesse of the seventh spere,\r\n  In convers letinge every element;                                    1810\r\n  And ther he saugh, with ful avysement,\r\n  The erratik sterres, herkeninge armonye\r\n  With sownes fulle of hevenish melodye.\r\n\r\n  260. And doun from thennes faste he gan avyse\r\n  This litel spot of erthe, that with the see                          1815\r\n  Enbraced is, and fully gan despyse\r\n  This wrecched world, and held al vanitee\r\n  To respect of the pleyn felicitee\r\n  That is in hevene above; and at the laste,\r\n  Ther he was slayn, his loking doun he caste;                         1820\r\n\r\n  261. And in him-self he lough right at the wo\r\n  Of hem that wepten for his deeth so faste;\r\n  And dampned al our werk that folweth so\r\n  The blinde lust, the which that may not laste,\r\n  And sholden al our herte on hevene caste.                            1825\r\n  And forth he wente, shortly for to telle,\r\n  Ther as Mercurie sorted him to dwelle.--\r\n\r\n  262. Swich fyn hath, lo, this Troilus for love,\r\n  Swich fyn hath al his grete worthinesse;\r\n  Swich fyn hath his estat real above,                                 1830\r\n  Swich fyn his lust, swich fyn hath his noblesse;\r\n  Swich fyn hath false worldes brotelnesse.\r\n  And thus bigan his lovinge of Criseyde,\r\n  As I have told, and in this wyse he deyde.\r\n\r\n  263.

Explicit Liber Troily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BOETHIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nMETRE 1. In order to elucidate the English text, I frequently quote the\r\noriginal Latin, usually from the text of T. Obbarius, Jena, 1843. See\r\nfurther in the Introduction.\r\n\r\n3. _rendinge_, Lat. 'lacerae'; rather rent, or tattered. The sense\r\n'rending' occurs in Ovid, Met. viii. 880.\r\n\r\n6. _that is to seyn._ The words in italics are not in the original, but\r\nwere added by Chaucer as explanatory. Throughout the treatise, I print all\r\nsuch passages in italics.\r\n\r\n8. _werdes_, 'weirds,' fate.\r\n\r\n 'Gloria felicis olim uiridisque iuuentae\r\n    Solantur maesti nunc mea fata senis.'\r\n\r\n12. _slake_, better _slakke_; cf. Cant. Ta. E. 1849. _empted_, 'effeto.'\r\nMS. C. has _emty_.\r\n\r\n13. _in yeres ... swete_: 'dulcibus annis.'\r\n\r\n14. _y-cleped_, invoked; 'uocata,' sc. 'mors.' Cf. Troilus, iv. 503.\r\n\r\n16. _naiteth_, refuseth; 'negat.' Icel. _neita_, to say nay.\r\n\r\n17. _lighte_, i.e. transitory; 'leuibus ... bonis.' The gloss 'sc.\r\ntemporels' (in A) gives the right sense. _sc._ = scilicet, namely; the form\r\n_temporels_ is the French plural.\r\n\r\n18, 19. _But now_:\r\n\r\n 'Nunc quia fallacem mutauit nubila uultum,\r\n    Protrahit ingratas impia uita moras.'\r\n\r\nThe translation _unagreable dwellinges_ is an unhappy one.\r\n\r\n22. _in stedefast degree_, in a secure position; 'stabili ... gradu.'\r\n\r\nWith regard to the last sentence, Mr. Stewart remarks, in his essay on\r\nBoethius, that Chaucer here 'actually reproduces the original Latin metre,'\r\ni.e. a hexameter and pentameter. The true M. E. pronunciation must, for\r\nthis purpose, be entirely neglected; which amounts to saying that Chaucer\r\nmust have been profoundly unconscious of any such intention.\r\n\r\nPROSE 1. 2. _and markede_: 'querimoniamque lacrimabilem stili officio\r\ndesignarem.' Hence _markede_ is 'wrote down'; and _pointel_ refers to the\r\n_stilus_. Cf. Som. Tale, D 1742. _with office_, by the use (of).\r\n\r\n6. _empted_, exhausted; 'inexhausti uigoris.' Of course the woman here\r\ndescribed is _Philosophia_.\r\n\r\n9. _doutous_; 'statura discretionis ambiguae.'\r\n\r\n12. _heef_, heaved; A. S. _h[=o]f_. In Layamon, _hof_, _haf_, _heaf_. I put\r\n_heef_ for _hef_, because the _e_ is long.\r\n\r\n13. _so that_: 'respicientiumque hominum frustrabatur intuitum.'\r\n\r\n14. _delye_ (so in both MSS.) = _deli-[=e]_, O. F. _deliè_ (see Cotgrave),\r\ndelicate, thin, slender, from Lat. _delicatus_, with the usual loss of _c_\r\nbetween two vowels and before the accented syllable; Lat. 'tenuissimis\r\nfilis.'\r\n\r\nAfter _crafte_ it would have been better to insert _and_; Lat.\r\n'indissolubili_que_ materiâ.' But some MSS., including C., omit _que_.\r\n\r\n18. _as it is wont_: 'ueluti fumosas imagines solet.'\r\n\r\n21. _a Grekissh P_; i.e. [PI]. _a Grekissh T_; i.e. [THETA], not [TAU]; the\r\nGreek [theta] being pronounced as _t_ in Latin. The reference is to [Greek:\r\nphilosophia praktikê kai theôrêtikê]; in Latin, Philosophia Actiua et\r\nContemplatiua; i. e. Practical (or Active) and Theoretical (or\r\nContemplative) Philosophy. This is the same distinction as that between the\r\n_Vita Actiua_ and _Vita Contemplatiua_, so common in medieval literature;\r\nsee note (3) to the Sec. Non. Tale, G 87; and note to P. Plowman, B. vi.\r\n251.\r\n\r\n26. _corven_, cut, cut away pieces from; Lat. 'sciderant.'\r\n\r\n33. _cruel_, i. e. stern; 'toruis.'\r\n\r\n34. _thise comune_: 'has scenicas meretriculas.'\r\n\r\n39. _no-thing fructefyinge_; 'infructuosis.' Hence we may perhaps prefer to\r\nread _no-thing fructuous_, as in Caxton and Thynne.\r\n\r\n41. _holden_: 'hominumque mentes assuefaciunt morbo, non liberant.'\r\n\r\n45. _for-why_, because (very common); seldom interrogative.\r\n\r\n47. _me_, from me; and, in fact, Caxton and Thynne read _from me_ or _fro\r\nme_. The forms _Eleaticis_, &c. are due to the Lat. text--'Eleaticis atque\r\nAcademicis studiis.' He should rather have said--'scoles of Elea and of the\r\nAcademie.' The _Eleatici philosophi_ were the followers of Zeno of Elea\r\n(Zeno Eleates, born about B. C. 488 at Elea (Velia) in Italy), and the\r\nfavourite disciple of Parmenides (who is expressly mentioned in Book iii.\r\npr. 12, l. 143). The Academic philosophers were followers of Plato.\r\n\r\n49. _mermaidenes_; Lat. 'Sirenes,' Sirens; cf. N. P. Tale, B 4461, and\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n_til it be at the laste_; a false translation. Rather _unto destruction_;\r\n'usque in exitium.' But, instead of _exitium_, MS. C. has _exitum_.\r\n\r\n55. _plounged_, drowned; 'mersa.' Cf. _dreint_, Met. 2, l. 1.\r\n\r\n59. _ner_, nearer; comparative, not positive; 'propius.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 2. 2. _mintinge_, intending; 'tendit ... ire.' Still in use in\r\nCambridgeshire.\r\n\r\n8. _sterres of the cold moon_: 'gelidae sidera lunae.' I suppose this means\r\nthe constellations seen by moonlight, but invisible in the day. The\r\nexpression _sidus lunae_, the moon's bright form, occurs in Pliny, Nat.\r\nHist. ii. 9. 6; but it is difficult to see how _sidera_ can have the same\r\nsense, as some commentators say.\r\n\r\n9. _recourses_, orbits; referring to the planets.\r\n\r\n_y-flit_, moved or whirled along by their different spheres; alluding to\r\nthe old Ptolemaic system of astronomy, which supposed that each planet was\r\nfastened to a revolving sphere, thus causing it to perform its orbit in a\r\ncertain time, varying in the case of each.\r\n\r\n_this man_: 'Comprensam [sc. stellam] in numeris uictor habebat.'\r\n\r\n16. _highteth_, adorns; 'ornet.' Prob. from the sb. _hight_, _hiht_ (A. S.\r\n_hyht_), joy, delight.\r\n\r\n17. _fleteth_, flows (i.e. abounds); 'grauidis influat uuis.'\r\n\r\n20. _empted_: 'Nunc iacet effeto lumine mentis.'\r\n\r\n22. _fool_, i.e. foolish, witless, senseless; 'stolidam.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 2. 6. _armures_, i.e. defensive armour; 'arma.'\r\n\r\n8. _in sikernesse_: 'inuicta te firmitate tuerentur.'\r\n\r\n14. _litargie_; better _letargye_, i.e. lethargy. Cf. Troil. i. 730.\r\n\r\n19. _yplyted_, pleated into a wrinkle; 'contracta in rugam ueste.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 3. 1. _discussed_, driven away; 'discussâ ... nocte.'\r\n\r\n4. _clustred_; 'glomerantur'; or 'covered with clouds,' as Chaucer says.\r\n\r\n5. _Chorus_, Corus, or Caurus, the north-west wind.\r\n\r\n6. _ploungy_, stormy, rainy; 'nimbosis ... imbribus.'\r\n\r\n8. _Borias_, Boreas, the north wind, from Thrace.\r\n\r\n9. _caves_; better _cave_, as in Caxton and Thynne; Lat. 'antro.' _beteth_;\r\n'uerberet'; hence Chaucer's gloss.\r\n\r\n11. _y-shaken_, 'uibratus'; i.e. tremulous, sparkling.\r\n\r\nPROSE 3. 2. _took_, drew in, received light; 'hausi caelum.'\r\n\r\n4. _beholde_, the present tense; 'respicio.'\r\n\r\n10. _norry_, pupil, lit. nourished one; 'alumne.'\r\n\r\n11. _parten the charge_, share the burden.\r\n\r\n15. _redoute my blame_, fear blame. _agrysen_, shudder.\r\n\r\n16. _quasi diceret non_, as if she would say no; as if she expected the\r\nanswer no. This remark is often inserted by Chaucer.\r\n\r\n19. _Plato_; B.C. 428-347. Before his time, Solon, Anaxagoras, and\r\nPythagoras all met with opposition. The fate of Socrates is well known.\r\n\r\n21. _The heritage_: 'Cuius hereditatem cum deinceps Epicureum uulgus ac\r\nStoicum, ceterique pro sua quisque parte raptum ire molirentur, meque\r\nreclamantem renitentemque uelut in partem praedae detraherent, uestem, quam\r\nmeis texueram manibus, disciderunt, abreptisque ab ea panniculis, totam me\r\nsibi cessisse credentes abiere.'\r\n\r\n38. _Anaxogore_, Anaxagoras, a Greek philosopher (B.C. 500-428); exiled\r\nfrom Athens (B.C. 450).\r\n\r\n39. _Zeno_; Zeno of Elea (see p. 420), born about B.C. 488, is said to have\r\nrisked his life to defend his country. His fate is doubtful.\r\n\r\n40. _Senecciens_, apparently meant for 'the followers of Seneca.' The\r\noriginal has: 'at Canios, at Senecas, at Soranos ... scire potuisti.'\r\n\r\n_Canios_, the Canii; i. e. men like Canius. The constancy and death of\r\nJulius Canius (or Canus) is related by Seneca, De Tranquillitate, cap. xiv.\r\nCf. Pr. iv. 131, and note, p. 424.\r\n\r\n41. _Sorans_, the Sorani; men like Soranus. Soranus is mentioned in\r\nTacitus, Annal. xvi. 23. Caxton and Thynne read _Soranos_, as in the Latin\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n42. _unsolempne_, uncelebrated; 'incelebris.'\r\n\r\n49. _it is to dispyse_, it (the host) is to be despised.\r\n\r\n53. _ententif_, busy about seizing useless baggage as spoil.\r\n\r\n_sarpulers_, sacks made of coarse canvas; in Caxton, _sarpleris_;\r\n'sarcinulas.' Cotgrave has: '_Serpillere_, a Sarpler, or Sarp-cloth, a\r\npiece of course canvas to pack up things in.' Cf. mod. F. _serpillière_.\r\n\r\n56. _palis_, also spelt _paleis_ (O. F. _palis_), lit. a palisading, or a\r\npiece of strong paling, a rampart, used to translate Lat. _uallum_. When\r\nspelt _paleis_, it must not be confused with _paleis_, a palace.\r\n\r\nMETRE 4. 3. _either fortune_, good fortune or bad.\r\n\r\n5. _hete_: 'Versum funditus excitantis aestum.' I suppose that _aestum_ is\r\nrather 'surge' than 'heat' here. See Met. vii. below, l. 3.\r\n\r\n6. _Vesevus_, 'Veseuus'; the same as Vesuvius; cf. Vergil, Georg. ii. 224.\r\n\r\n7. _wrytheth_, writhes out, throws forth wreaths of smoke. Here the old\r\nprinted editions by Caxton and Thynne, as well as MS. Ii. 1. 38, happily\r\nrestore the text; Lat. 'Torquet.'\r\n\r\n8. Caxton and Thynne have _thonder-leyte_, which is perhaps better. MS. Ii.\r\n1. 38 has _thonder leit_.\r\n\r\n13. _stable of his right_: 'stabilis, suique iuris.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 4. 2. _Artow lyk_. The original is partly in Greek. 'An [Greek: onos\r\nluras]?' Some MSS. have: 'Esne [Greek: onos pros luran]?' And MS. C. has:\r\n'Esne asinus ad liram?' In an edition of Boethius by Renatus Vallinus,\r\nprinted in 1656, I find the following note: 'Ut et omnes veteres scripsere,\r\nVarro in satyra quæ Testamentum inscribitur apud Agellium, lib. iii. cap.\r\nxvi: _Ii_ liberi, _si erunt_ [Greek: onoi luras], _exheredes sunto_. Suidas\r\nex Menandro, Lucianus, Martian. Capella, lib. viii., atque alii quos refert\r\nErasmus, in eo adagio. Imo et apud Varronem id nominis satyra extitit.' It\r\nhas clearly a proverbial reference to dullness of perception. Ch. quotes it\r\nagain in his Troilus, i. 731, where he so explains it.\r\n\r\n3. _why spillestow teres_, why do you waste tears; 'Quid lacrimis manas?'\r\nAfter these words occur, in the original, four Greek words which Chaucer\r\ndoes not translate, viz.: [Greek: Exauda, mê keuthe noô]: i. e. speak out,\r\ndo not hide them in your mind; quoted from Homer, Iliad i. 363.\r\n\r\nWith lines 3 and 4 compare Troilus, i. 857.\r\n\r\n7. _by him-self_, in itself; 'per se.' Alluding to 'sharpnesse,' i. e.\r\n'asperitas.'\r\n\r\n15. _enformedest_, didst conform; 'formares.'\r\n\r\n17. _ordre of hevene_; 'ad caelestis ordinis exemplar.' This refers to the\r\nwords of Plato just at the end of the 9th book of The Republic: [Greek: en\r\nouranô isôs paradeigma anakeitai.] Cf. also the last lines of Book II of\r\nthe present treatise.\r\n\r\n18. _confermedest_ (MS. A, _enfourmedist_), didst confirm; 'sanxisti.' The\r\nreading _conformedest_ evidently arose from confusion with _enformedest_\r\nabove, in l. 15.\r\n\r\n19. _mouth of Plato_; referring to Book V (473 D) of the Republic: [Greek:\r\nean mê, ê hoi philosophoi basileusôsin en tais polesin, ê hoi basilês te\r\nnyn legomenoi ki dynastai philosophêsôsi gnêsiôs te kai hikanôs, kai touto\r\neis tauton xympesê, dynamis te politikê kai philosophia; tôn de nyn\r\nporeuomenôn chôris eph' hekateron hai pollai physeis ex anankês\r\napokleisthôsin, ouk esti kakôn paula ... tais polesi; dokô de, oude tô\r\nanthrôpinô genei.]\r\n\r\n24. _the same Plato_; in the 6th Dialogue on the Republic.\r\n\r\n25. _cause_, reason; 'caussam.' _wyse_, i.e. '_for_ wise men.'\r\n\r\n27. _felonous tormentours citizenes_, citizens who are wicked and\r\noppressive; the substantives are in apposition.\r\n\r\n33. _knowinge with me_, my witnesses; 'mihi ... conscii.'\r\n\r\n36. _discordes ... preyeres_; 'inexorabilesque discordiae.'\r\n\r\n37. _for this libertee_, &c.; 'et quod conscientiae libertas habet.'\r\n\r\n41. _Conigaste_, Conigastus, or Cunigastus; mentioned in Cassiodorus,\r\nEpist. lib. viii. ep. 28. The facts here referred to are known only from\r\nthe present passage.\r\n\r\n_prospre fortunes_ translates 'fortunas' simply; it seems to mean 'success'\r\nor 'well-being.'\r\n\r\n43. _Trigwille_, Triguilla; 'regiae praepositum domus.'\r\n\r\n45. _auctoritee_; 'obiecta periculis auctoritate protexi.'\r\n\r\n52. _cariages_, taxes; 'uectigalibus.' See a similar use in the Pers. Tale,\r\nI 752, and note.\r\n\r\n59. _inplitable_, intricate: 'inexplicabilis.' _coempcioun_, an imposition\r\nso called; see Chaucer's explanation below, in l. 64. In Greek, [Greek:\r\nsynônê].\r\n\r\n61. _Campaigne_, Campania, in Italy, _provost_; 'praefectum praetorii.'\r\n\r\n64-67. See the footnote. I have here transposed this gloss, so as to make\r\nit _follow_, instead of _preceding_, the mention of _coempcioun_ in the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n68. _Paulin_, Decius Paulinus, consul in 498; mentioned in Cassiodorus,\r\nEpist. lib. i. epist. 23, lib. iii. epist. 29.\r\n\r\n69. _houndes_; 'Palatini canes.'\r\n\r\n73. _Albin_, perhaps Decius Albinus, to whom Theodoric addressed a letter\r\npreserved in Cassiodorus, lib. iv. ep. 30. See l. 156 below.\r\n\r\n75. _Ciprian_, Cyprian. We know something of him from two letters in\r\nCassiodorus, Epist. v. 40, 41. Theodoric esteemed him highly. See a\r\ndiscussion of his career in H. F. Stewart's Essay on Boethius, pp. 42-52.\r\n\r\n78. _to hem-ward_, i.e. for the benefit of the officers around me; 'mihi\r\n... nihil apud aulicos, quo magis essem tutior, reseruaui.'\r\n\r\n81. _Basilius_. Not much is known of him; see H. F. Stewart, as above, p.\r\n48.\r\n\r\n82. _compelled_, i.e. bribed to accuse me. _for nede of foreine moneye_:\r\n'alienae aeris necessitate.'\r\n\r\n84. _Opilion_, Opilio; the Opilio mentioned in Cassiodorus, lib. v. epist.\r\n41, and lib. viii. epist. 16, and brother of the Cyprian mentioned above,\r\nl. 75. His father's name was Opilio likewise.\r\n\r\n89. _aperceived_, made known. _the king_, i.e. Theodoric, king of Italy for\r\n33 years, A.D. 493-526. His reign was, on the whole, good and glorious, but\r\nhe committed the great crime of putting to death both Boethius and his aged\r\nfather-in-law Symmachus, for which he afterwards expressed his deep\r\nrepentance. See Gibbon's Roman Empire. The chief record of his reign is in\r\nthe collection of twelve books of public epistles composed in his name by\r\nCassiodorus. The seat of his government was Ravenna, as mentioned below.\r\n\r\n93. _lykned_; rather, _added_; Lat. 'posse _adstrui_ uidetur.'\r\n\r\n95-194. See a translation into modern English of the whole of this passage,\r\nin H. F. Stewart's Essay, pp. 37-41.\r\n\r\n101. _axestow in somme_, if you ask particularly; 'summam quaeris?'\r\n\r\n106, 107. _forsake_, deny. _have wold_, have willed, did wish.\r\n\r\n109. _and that I confesse_. Here Chaucer's version seems to be quite at\r\nfault. 'At uolui, nec unquam uelle desistam. Fatebimur? [MS. C. Et\r\nfatebimur.] Sed impediendi delatoris opera cessabit.'\r\n\r\n113. _by me_, with regard to me; 'de me.'\r\n\r\n117. _Socrates_; in Plato's Republic, Book VI: [Greek: tên apseudeian ...\r\nmisein, tên d' alêtheian stergein] (485 C).\r\n\r\n120. _preisen_, appraise, judge of: 'aestimandum.'\r\n\r\n131. _Canius_, better _Canus_, i.e. 'Julius Canus, whose philosophic death\r\nis described by Seneca, De Tranquillitate Animi, cap. xiv.'--Gibbon. He has\r\nalready been mentioned above, Prose iii. l. 40.\r\n\r\n132. _Germeynes sone_, the son of Germanicus. This Gaius Cæsar is better\r\nknown as Caligula, the emperor who succeeded Tiberius.\r\n\r\n143. _famileres_, friends, i.e. disciples, viz. Epicurus, in the De Ira\r\nDivina, cap. xiii (Stewart).\r\n\r\n154. _Verone_, Verona; next to Ravenna, the favourite residence of\r\nTheodoric.\r\n\r\n156. _his real maiestee_, high treason, lit. 'his royal majesty'; Lat.\r\n'maiestatis crimen.' The king was intent upon repressing all freedom of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n167. _submittede_, subdued: 'summitteret.'\r\n\r\n171. _present_, i.e. he would, even in such a case, have been allowed to\r\nappear in his defence, would have been called upon to confess his crime,\r\nand would have been condemned in a regular manner.\r\n\r\n173. _fyve hundred_, nearly 500 miles. Boethius was imprisoned in a tower\r\nat Pavia.\r\n\r\n176. _as who seith, nay_; i.e. it is said ironically. The senate well\r\ndeserve that no one should ever defend them as I did, and be convicted for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n181. _sacrilege_; glossed _sorcerie_: 'sacrilegio.' Sorcery or magic is\r\nintended. 'At the command of the barbarians, the occult science of a\r\nphilosopher was stigmatised with the names of sacrilege and\r\nmagic.'--Gibbon. See below, l. 196.\r\n\r\n186. _Pictagoras_, Pythagoras. The saying here attributed to him is given\r\nin the original in Greek--[Greek: hepou theô]. Some MSS. add the gloss, _i.\r\ndeo non diis seruiendum_. MS. C. has: _deo et non diis sacrificandum_.\r\n\r\n188. _I_, i. e. for me. A remarkable grammatical use.\r\n\r\n190. _right clene_: 'penetral innocens domus.'\r\n\r\n193. _thorugh_, i. e. for. Caxton and Thynne read _for_.\r\n\r\n195. _feith_: 'de te tanti criminis fidem capiunt.'\r\n\r\n198. _it suffiseth nat only ... but-yif_, this alone is insufficient ...\r\nunless thou also, &c. _of thy free wille_: 'ultro.'\r\n\r\n212. _good gessinge_, high esteem: 'existimatio bona.'\r\n\r\n215. _charge_, burden, load: 'sarcinam.'\r\n\r\n219. _by gessinge_, in men's esteem: 'existimatione.'\r\n\r\n223. _for drede_: 'nostri discriminis terrore.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 5. 1. _whele_, sphere: 'orbis.' Not only were there seven spheres\r\nallotted to the planets, but there was an eighth larger sphere, called the\r\nsphere of fixed stars, and a ninth 'sphere of first motion,' or _primum\r\nmobile_, which revolved round the earth once in 24 hours, according to the\r\nPtolemaic astronomy. This is here alluded to. God is supposed to sit in an\r\nimmoveable throne beyond it.\r\n\r\n3. _sweigh_, violent motion; the very word used in the same connexion in\r\nthe Man of Lawes Tale, B 296; see note to that passage.\r\n\r\n4. _ful hornes_, i. e. her horns filled up, as at full moon, when she meets\r\n'with alle the bemes' of the Sun, i. e. reflects them fully.\r\n\r\n7. _derke hornes_, horns faintly shining, as when the moon, a thin\r\ncrescent, is near the sun and nearly all obscured.\r\n\r\n 'The bente mone with hir hornes pale;' Troil. iii. 624.\r\n\r\n9. _cometh eft ayein hir used cours_, returns towards her accustomed\r\ncourse, i. e. appears again, as usual, as a morning-star, in due course. I\r\nthink the text is incorrect; for _cometh_ read _torneth_, i. e. turns. Lat.\r\ntext: 'Solitas iterum mutet habenas.' The planet Venus, towards one\r\napparent extremity of her orbit, follows the sun, as an evening-star; and\r\nagain, towards the other apparent extremity, precedes it as a morning-star.\r\nSo Cicero, De Nat. Deorum, ii. 20. 53: 'dicitur Lucifer, cum antegreditur\r\nsolem, cum subsequitur autem, Hesperus.'\r\n\r\n11. _restreinest_, shortenest; the sun's apparent course being shorter in\r\nwinter. Lat. 'stringis.'\r\n\r\n13. _swifte tydes_, short times; viz. of the summer nights.\r\n\r\n19. _Arcturus_, [alpha] Boötis, in the sign Libra; conspicuous in the\r\nnights of spring.\r\n\r\n20. _Sirius_, [alpha] Canis Maioris, or the Dog-star, in the sign of\r\nCancer; seen before sun-rise in the so-called dog-days, in July and August.\r\nIt was supposed that the near approach of Sirius to the Sun caused great\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n21. _his lawe_, i.e. '_its_ law'; and so again in _his propre_.\r\n\r\n28. _on._ Caxton and Thynne rightly read _on_.\r\n\r\n29. _derke derknesses_, obscure darkness: 'obscuris ... tenebris.' Not a\r\nhappy expression.\r\n\r\n31. _covered and kembd_: 'compta.' Cf. _kembde_ in Squi. Ta. F 560.\r\n\r\n37. _erthes_, lands; the pl. is used, to translate 'terras.'\r\n\r\n41. _bonde_, i.e. the chain of love; see Bk. ii. Met. 8. l. 15.\r\n\r\nPROSE 5. 1. _borken out_, barked out; 'delatraui.' MS. A. changes _borken_\r\ninto _broken_. The glossaries, &c., all seem to miss this excellent example\r\nof the strong pp. of _berken_. _Borken_ appears as a pt. t. pl. in the King\r\nof Tars, l. 400. The A.S. pp. _borcen_ appears in the A.S. Leechdoms, ed.\r\nCockayne, i. 170, l. 17.\r\n\r\n14. _oo ... king._ The original is in Greek--[Greek: heis koiranos estin,\r\nheis basileus]: quoted from Homer, Iliad, ii. 204, with the change from\r\n[Greek: estô] to [Greek: estin].\r\n\r\n18, 19. _thy citee_, i.e. the city of heaven; note the context.\r\n\r\n22. _palis_, paling, rampart; 'uallo.' Clearer than _paleis_, as in A,\r\nwhich might mean palace; but both spellings occur in French.\r\n\r\n25. _face_ (facies), the look of this prison.\r\n\r\n31. _in comune good_, for the common good: 'in commune bonum.'\r\n\r\n34. _thinges ... aposed_, accusations; 'delatorum.'\r\n\r\n45. _thy wode Muse_: 'Musae saeuientis'; cf. Met. 5 above, l. 22.\r\n\r\n51. _thilke passiouns_: 'ut quae in tumorem perturbationibus influentibus\r\ninduruerunt.'\r\n\r\n54. _by an esier touchinge_ refers to the preceding _mowen ... softe_:\r\n'tactu blandiore mollescant.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 6. This Metre refers to the necessity of doing everything in its\r\nproper season.\r\n\r\n2. 'When the sun is in Cancer'; i.e. in the month of June.\r\n\r\n4. _lat him gon_, let him go and eat acorns.\r\n\r\n6. _whan the feld_: 'Cùm saeuis Aquilonibus Stridens campus inhorruit.'\r\n_Chirkinge_, hoarse, rustling; alluding to the rustling of frozen grass in\r\na high wind.\r\n\r\n15. _And forthy_: 'Sic quod praecipiti uiâ Certum deserit ordinem, Laetos\r\nnon habet exitus.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 6. 10. _by fortunous fortune_: 'fortuitis casibus.' Not well\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n14. _the same ... thou_, thou didst sing the same thing. See Met. v. 22.\r\n\r\n17. _owh!_ an exclamation of astonishment: Lat. 'papae.'\r\n\r\n18. _why that thou_: 'cur in tam salubri sententiâ locatus aegrotes.'\r\n\r\n20. _I not ... what_: 'nescio, quid abesse coniecto.'\r\n\r\n22. _with whiche governailes_, by what sort of government.\r\n\r\n28. _the strengthe_, the strength of the gaping stockade discloses an\r\nopening: 'uelut hiante ualli robore.' The corruption of _chyning_ to\r\n_schynyng_ in MS. A. makes sad nonsense of the passage.\r\n\r\n42. _they may nat al_: 'sibique totum extirpare non possint.'\r\n\r\n55. _or elles the entree_: 'uel aditum reconciliandae sospitatis inueni.'\r\n\r\n56. _For-why, for_, Because, since. _for-thy_, therefore.\r\n\r\n64. _the auctor ... of hele_: 'sospitatis auctori.'\r\n\r\n65. _norisshinges_; perhaps better _norisshing_, as in Caxton and Thynne;\r\n'fomitem,' i. e. furtherance.\r\n\r\n71. _faster_, firmer, stronger: 'firmioribus.'\r\n\r\n76. _to maken thinne and wayk_: 'attenuare.'\r\n\r\n77. _meneliche_, moderate: 'mediocribus.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 7. 1. _yeten a-doun_, pour down; 'fundere.' Not _geten_, as in A.\r\n\r\n2. _trouble_, turbid; 'Turbidus Auster.'\r\n\r\n3. _medleth the hete_: 'Misceat aestum.' See above, Met. iv. l. 5.\r\n\r\n5. _clere as glas_; cf. Knight's Tale, A 1958.\r\n\r\n_withstande_: 'Mox resoluto Sordida caeno, Visibus obstat.'\r\n\r\n7. _royleth_, wanders; 'uagatur.' Not 'rolls.'\r\n\r\n11. _holden_, keep to; cf. 'Hold the hye wey'; Truth, l. 20. _weyve_:\r\n'Gaudia pelle, Pelle timorem; Spemque fugato.'\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nPROSE 1. 13. _to begyle_; copied in Troil. iv. 2, 3:--\r\n\r\n       '---- y-thonked be Fortune,\r\n  That semeth trewest whan she wol bigyle.'\r\n\r\n22. _myn entree_: 'de nostro adyto.' But Chaucer has translated 'adyto' as\r\nif it were 'aditu.' He translates _aditum_ by _entree_ in Bk. i. Pr. 6, l.\r\n55. _Adyto_ is 'sanctuary.'\r\n\r\n28. _Com_, i. e. let (it) come; imperative: 'Adsit igitur rhetoricae\r\nsuadela dulcedinis.'\r\n\r\n32. _moedes_, moods, strains; 'modos.' _prolaciouns_, utterances.\r\n\r\n35. Compare Chaucer's poem on Fortune; and see the long note at the\r\nbeginning of the Notes to that poem.\r\n\r\n45. _use hir maneres_; rather, make the best of her conduct: 'utere\r\nmoribus.' _agrysest_, shudderest at, dreadest.\r\n\r\n48. _She hath forsaken_: 'Reliquit enim te, quam non relicturam nemo umquam\r\npoterit esse securus.'\r\n\r\n51. The MSS. usually agree in this clause. Chaucer's gloss is due to an\r\nobscure note in MS. C., viz. 'vel quam non relictam, secundum alios\r\nlibros.' Other notes occur there, but do not help us.\r\n\r\n68. _floor_: 'intra fortunae aream.' We say 'area' or 'domain.'\r\n\r\n77. _amonges_, at various times, from time to time, now and then; see New\r\nE. Dict., s.v. _Among_, B. 2.\r\n\r\n83. _cesede_, would cease; copied in Troil. i. 848:--\r\n\r\n 'For if hir wheel stinte any-thing to torne,\r\n  Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 1. 3. _Eurype_, Euripus; a narrow channel, with a strong current;\r\nespecially that between Boeotia and Euboea. This use of the word is here\r\nseen to be far older in English than the quotation from Holland's Pliny in\r\nthe New E. Dict.\r\n\r\n8. _so hard_: 'Ultroque gemitus, dura quos fecit, ridet.'\r\n\r\n9. _laugheth_, laughs at; 'ridet.' It is impossible to accept the reading\r\n_lyssheth_ in C. There seems to be no such word. It probably arose from the\r\nattempt of the scribe to represent the guttural sound of _gh_, because we\r\nactually find him writing _neysshebour_ for _neighbour_ twice, viz. in Bk.\r\nii. Pr. 3. 24, and in Pr. 7. 57. This passage is imitated in Troil. iv. 7:\r\n'Than laugheth she and maketh him the mowe.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 2. 1. Compare Chaucer's 'Fortune'; l. 25, &c.\r\n\r\n4. _every-dayes_, daily: 'cottidianis querelis.'\r\n\r\n37. _I torne_: 'Rotam uolubili orbe uersamus.'\r\n\r\n39. _Worth up_, climb up: 'Ascende.' Cf. P. Plowman, B. vii. 91; Wars of\r\nAlexander, 2878, 2973.\r\n\r\n42. _Cresus_, Croesus; see note to Monk. Tale, B 3917.\r\n\r\n47. _Perciens_, Persians. But Chaucer is here wrong. The Lat. text has\r\n'Persi regis,' i. e. king Perseus. Perseus, or Perses III, was the last\r\nking of Macedonia, who was defeated by L. Æmilius Paulus in a decisive\r\nbattle fought near Pydna, in June, B.C. 168. 'When brought before Æmilius\r\n[here, Paulus], he is said to have degraded himself by the most abject\r\nsupplications; but he was treated with kindness by the Roman general;'\r\nSmith, Class. Dict. See Livy, xl. 57; xli. 53; xliv. 32; &c.; Plutarch,\r\nLife of Æmilius.\r\n\r\n51. _Tragedie._ Cf. the definition in the Monk. Prol. B 3163; and note to\r\nAnelida, 320.\r\n\r\n53. _in Greke._ These two words are not in the original, but the following\r\nquotation is given in Greek: [Greek: duo tous pithous, ton men hena kakôn,\r\nton de heteron kalôn]. Some MSS. add: 'duo dolia quidem malum alterum\r\nbonum.' From Homer, Iliad, xxiv. 527:\r\n\r\n  [Greek: doioi gar te pithoi katakeiatai en Dios oudei,]\r\n  [Greek: dôrôn, hoia didôsi, kakôn, heteros de eaôn.]\r\n\r\nCf. notes to Wyf of Bathes Prol. D 170, and to Leg. of Good Women, 195.\r\n\r\n54. _in the entree_: 'in Iouis limine': [Greek: en Dios oudei].\r\n\r\n61. _realme_: 'intra commune omnibus regnum locatus.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 2. 1. _hielde_, pour: 'Tantas fundat opes, nec retrahat manum Pleno\r\ncopia cornu.'\r\n\r\n8. _as fool-large_, like one that is foolishly lavish: 'Multi prodigus\r\nauri.'\r\n\r\n11. _other gapinges_: 'Alios pandit hiatus.' Some MSS. have _Altos_, but\r\nChaucer evidently read _Alios_, as in MS. C.\r\n\r\n13. _to any ... ende_; rather, 'within a prescribed boundary'; 'Certo fine\r\nretentent.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 3. 22. _princes._ These were, in particular, Festus and Symmachus.\r\nBoethius married Rusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus. Hence the allusion\r\nto his _fadres-in-lawe_ (socerorum) just below, in l. 26; where the right\r\nsense is _parents-in-law_. See Stewart's Essay, p. 24.\r\n\r\n23. _leef_: 'delectusque in affinitatem principum ciuitatis, quod\r\npretiosissimum propinquitatis genus est, priùs carus, quam proximus esse\r\ncoepisti.' Hence _the whiche thing_ really refers back to _affinitee_,\r\nwhich is hardly obvious in the E. version.\r\n\r\n40. _whan thou_: 'cùm in Circo duorum medius consulum circumfusae\r\nmultitudinis exspectationem triumphali largitione satiasti.'\r\n\r\n43. _gave thou wordes_: 'Dedisti ... uerba fortunae.'\r\n\r\n48. _privee_, a man of private station, not of noble rank: 'priuato.' The\r\nreference is to the election of his two sons as consuls in one day.\r\n\r\n55. _Art thou_: 'An tu in hanc uitae scenam nunc primum subitus hospesque\r\nuenisti.' Thus _shadwe or tabernacle_ is meant to translate _scenam_.\r\n\r\n60. _laste day_; quoted in Chaucer's 'Fortune,' l. 71; see note to the\r\nline.\r\n\r\n61. _and also_, i. e. even to such Fortune as abides and does _not_ desert\r\nthe man: 'fortunae ... etiam manentis.'\r\n\r\n62. _thar recche_; it is absolutely necessary to insert _thee_ after\r\n_thar_; i. e. And therefore, what, do you suppose, need you care? _yif\r\nthou_, i. e. whether thou.\r\n\r\nMETRE 3. 10. _the fairnesse_: 'Iam spinis abeat decus.'\r\n\r\n13. _over-whelveth_, turns over: 'Verso concitat aequore.' _whelveth_ is\r\nthe right form, as noted by Stratmann; it occurs in MS. Ii. 1. 38, and in\r\nthe black-letter editions. It occurs again in Palladius on Husbandry, i.\r\n161: 'For harme ... may ... perchaunce the _overwhelve_,' i.e. for perhaps\r\nharm may overthrow thee. And again, in the same, i. 781: '_overwhelve_ hit\r\nupsodowne,' i.e. turn it (the land) right over.\r\n\r\n16. _tomblinge_, fleeting, transitory; 'caducis.'\r\n\r\n18. _nis_, is; we must disregard the second negative.\r\n\r\nPROSE 4. 3. _ne be comen_, is not come; i.e. did not come. It refers to\r\npast time.\r\n\r\n5. _For in alle_: 'Nam in omni aduersitate fortunae infelicissimum genus\r\nest infortunii, fuisse felicem.' This famous sentence has been several\r\ntimes copied. See, e.g., Troil. iii. 1625-8; Dante, _Inferno_, v. 121-3;\r\nTennyson, _Locksley Hall_, 76.\r\n\r\n8. _But that thou_, i.e. 'but the fact that thou.' _abyest_, sufferest:\r\n'falsae opinionis supplicium luis.'\r\n\r\n12. _For al be it_: 'Nam si te hoc inane nomen fortuitae felicitatis\r\nmouet.'\r\n\r\n20. _Symacus_, Symmachus. There were several distinguished men of this\r\nfamily. Q. Aurelius Symmachus was a statesman and author in the latter half\r\nof the fourth century. The one here referred to is Q. Aurelius Memmius\r\nSymmachus, who had been consul under Odoacer in 485, and was involved in\r\nthe fate of Boethius, being put to death by Theodoric in 525, shortly after\r\nthe execution of Boethius in 524. He had two daughters, Rusticiana and\r\nGalla, of whom the former married Boethius. See Procopius, de Bello\r\nGothico, lib. i., and several Epistles in Cassiodorus, viz. lib. iv. epist.\r\n22, 37, 66.\r\n\r\n25. _thy wyf_; i. e. Rusticiana, daughter of Symmachus; for there is no\r\nproof that Boethius was twice married (Stewart, p. 24). She survived the\r\ncapture of Rome by the Goths under Totila, A.D. 546. 'The riches of\r\nRusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus and widow of Boethius, had been\r\ngenerously devoted to alleviate the calamities of famine. But the\r\nbarbarians were exasperated by the report, that she had prompted the people\r\nto overthrow the statue of the great Theodoric; and the life of that\r\nvenerable matron would have been sacrificed to his memory, if Totila had\r\nnot respected her birth, her virtues, and even the pious motive of her\r\nrevenge.'--Gibbon, Rom. Empire, ch. 43.\r\n\r\n31. _two sones_; the two spoken of just above (Pr. iii. l. 35), as being\r\nboth made consuls together. This was in 522.\r\n\r\n_conseilours_, i.e. of consular rank: 'consulares.'\r\n\r\n40. _thyne ancres_. Hence the line, 'Yit halt thyn ancre.' Fortune, l. 38.\r\n\r\n52. _thy delices_: 'delicias tuas.' The sense here intended is\r\n'effeminacy,' or 'unmanly weakness.'\r\n\r\n56. _ful anguissous_, very full of anxieties: 'Anxia enim res,' &c.\r\nRepeated in Troilus, iii. 816, q.v.\r\n\r\n68. _for alwey_, &c. Very obscure. Chaucer seems to mean--'for always, in\r\nevery man's case, there is, in something or other, that which (if he has\r\nnot experienced it) he does not understand; or else he dreads that which he\r\nhas already experienced.' The Latin is clearer: 'inest enim singulis, quod\r\ninexpertus ignoret, expertus exhorreat.'\r\n\r\n79. _nothing [is] wrecched_. The insertion of _is_ completes the sense:\r\n'adeo nihil _est_ miserum, nisi cùm putes.' Observe '_nis a wrecche_' in\r\nChaucer's own gloss (l. 81); and see l. 25 of 'Fortune.'\r\n\r\n83. _by the agreabletee_, by means of the equanimity: 'aequanimitate\r\ntolerantis.' Not having the word 'equanimity' at command, Chaucer\r\nparaphrases it by 'agreeabletee or egalitee,' i. e. accommodating or\r\nequable behaviour. Cf. l. 92.\r\n\r\n86. _The swetnesse_, &c. Cf. Troilus, iii. 813-5; and Man of Lawes Tale, B\r\n421-2, and note.\r\n\r\n89. _withholden_, retained: 'retineri non possit.' _that_, so that.\r\n\r\n107. _sheweth it wel_, it is plain: 'manifestum est.'\r\n\r\n110. _either he woot_, &c.; copied in Troilus, iii. 820-833.\r\n\r\n115. _lest he lese that ... it_, lest he lose that which. MS. A. _omits_\r\n'it'; but the phrase is idiomatic.\r\n\r\n119. _this is to seyn that men_, that is to say that, in such a case, men,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n120. _lost_, loss. This form of the sb. occurs elsewhere; as in Gower, i.\r\n147 (goth to _lost_); and in P. Plowman, C. vii. 275; &c. See Stratmann.\r\n\r\n131. _it ne maketh_, it does not make men miserable.\r\n\r\nMETRE 4. 7. _lause_, loose; Icel. _lauss_: 'solutae.' Usually _loos_, as in\r\nCant. Ta. A 4064, 4352.\r\n\r\n8. _forthy if thou_: 'Fugiens periculosam Sortem sedis amoenae, Humili\r\ndomum memento Certus figere saxo.' Chaucer's translation is hardly correct;\r\n_sortem_ and _sedis_ must be taken in close connection. 'Avoiding the\r\nperilous condition of a fair (and exposed) situation, take care to found\r\nthy house securely on a low-lying (and sheltered) rock.'\r\n\r\n12. _weleful_: 'Felix robore ualli Duces serenus aeuum.' _palis_, stockade,\r\nrampart; as before, Bk. i. Pr. 3. 56, Pr. 5. 22.\r\n\r\nPROSE 5. 10. _to hem that despenden it_; rather, by spending it; Lat.\r\n'effundendo.' So again, in l. 11, _to thilke folke that mokeren it_ answers\r\nto the Lat. gerund 'coaceruando.'\r\n\r\n11. _mokeren it_, hoard it. Perhaps related to O.F. _mucier_; see\r\n_Curmudgeon_ in my Etym. Dict. See _mokereres_, misers, below.\r\n\r\n15. _stenteth to ben had_, ceases to be possessed: 'desinit possideri.'\r\n\r\n16. _large_, lavish; 'largiendi usu desinit possideri.'\r\n\r\n18. _as of that_, as regards that hoard.\r\n\r\n19. _a voys al hool_, a voice not yet dispersed: 'uox ... tota.'\r\n\r\n32. _yif it wanteth_, if it lacks: 'carens animae motu atque membrorum\r\ncompage.'\r\n\r\n35. _of the laste_: 'postremae aliquid pulcritudinis.'  Perhaps it means\r\n'of the lowest kind of beauty.' Mr. Stewart, in his Essay, p. 225, reads\r\n_postremo_, for which I find _no_ authority. MS. C. has _postreme_.\r\n\r\n36. _through the distinccioun_: 'suique distinctione.'\r\n\r\n40. _Why sholde it nat_, &c. In some editions, this passage is not marked\r\nas being assigned to Boethius. In others, it is.\r\n\r\n85. _ostelments_, furniture, household goods: 'supellectilis.' O.F.\r\n_ostillement_, _oustillement_, furniture; cf. mod. F. _outil_, a word of\r\ndoubtful origin. Cf. l. 94.\r\n\r\n90. _subgit_; as if for 'suppositis'; but the Lat. text has 'sepositis,'\r\ni.e. separate, independent.\r\n\r\n92. _beest_, animal: 'diuinum merito rationis animal.'\r\n\r\n97. _of the lowest_, &c., 'by means of vilest things.'\r\n\r\n101. _yif that al_, &c., 'if all the good possessed is more valuable than\r\nthe thing possessing it.'\r\n\r\n105. _and certes_: 'quod quidem haud immerito cadit.'\r\n\r\n111. _it cometh_: 'it arises from some defect in them.'\r\n\r\n121. _Gabbe I of this_, do I lie concerning this?\r\n\r\n125. _weneth._ The texts have _and weneth_; but I suppress _and_ to make\r\nsense, and to make the translation agree with the Latin. 'Atqui diuitiae\r\npossidentibus persaepè nocuerunt, cùm pessimus quisque, eóque alieni magis\r\nauidus, quidquid usquam auri gemmarumque est, se solum qui habeat\r\ndignissimum putat.'\r\n\r\n128. _way-feringe_; MS. A, _way-faryng_. Both forms, _feringe_ and\r\n_faring(e)_ occur; see Stratmann. _Feringe_ = A. S. _f[=e]rende_, from the\r\nweak verb _f[=e]ran_, to go, travel; whilst _faringe_ = A. S. _farende_,\r\nfrom the strong verb _faran_, to go. _F[=e]ran_ (= _*f[=o]rian_) is\r\nderived, with vowel-mutation, from the stem _*f[=o]r_, appearing in\r\n_f[=o]r_, the pt. t. of _faran_.\r\n\r\n130. _singe_, &c. Doubtless from Juvenal, Sat. x. 22; see Wyf of Bathes\r\nTale, D 1191, and the note.\r\n\r\nMETRE 5. Largely imitated in Chaucer's poem called 'The Former Age,' which\r\nsee. See also the Notes to the same.\r\n\r\n5. _They ne coude_, they knew not how: 'Non Bacchica munera norant Liquido\r\nconfundere melle.'\r\n\r\n6. _piment_, usually spiced wine; here, wine mixed with honey. See Rom. of\r\nthe Rose, 6027, and the note. _clarree_, wine mixed with honey and spices,\r\nand then strained till it is clear; clarified wine. See Rom. of the Rose,\r\n5967, 6026; Former Age, 16; Kn. Tale, A 1471. Chaucer uses these two words\r\nhere in conjunction, for the simple reason that he was thinking of the\r\nparallel passage in the French Rom. de la Rose, which is imitated from the\r\npresent passage in Boethius. Ll. 8418-9 are:--\r\n\r\n 'Et de l'iaue simple bevoient\r\n  Sans querre _piment_ ne _claré_.'\r\n\r\n7. _ne they coude_: 'Nec lucida uellera Serum Tyrio miscere ueneno.' Hence\r\nthe _Seriens_ are the _Seres_, or Chinese; and _the venim of Tyrie_ should\r\nrather be _the venim of Tyre_, but Chaucer follows the adjectival form in\r\nthe original, both here and in Bk. iii. Met. 4, l. 2. _Venim_ is not the\r\nright word here; 'ueneno' merely means 'dye.' The reference is to the\r\n_murex_ or purple shell-fish. See Vergil, Aen. iv. 262: '_Tyrio_que ardebat\r\n_murice_ laena'; and Georg. ii. 465: '_alba_ nec Assyrio _fucatur lana\r\nueneno_.'\r\n\r\n13. _gest ne straungere_: 'hospes.' Cf. Former Age, 21.\r\n\r\n17. _armures_, defensive armour: 'arma.' The usual reading is _arua_, i. e.\r\nfields; but more than six MSS. have _arma_, and Chaucer's copy had the\r\nsame; as appears from MS. C.\r\n\r\n18. _For wherto_: 'for to what purpose, or what sort of madness of enemies\r\nwould first take up arms, when they saw but cruel wounds (as the result)\r\nand no rewards for the blood that was shed?'\r\n\r\n22. _But the anguissous_: 'Sed saeuior ignibus Aetnae Feruens amor ardet\r\nhabendi.'\r\n\r\n24. _Allas!_ &c. Cf. Former Age, 27-32. _the gobetes or the weightes of\r\ngold_: 'Auri ... pondera.'\r\n\r\n26. _He dalf_: 'Pretiosa pericula fodit.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 6. 8. _the imperie of consulers_, consular rank: 'consulare\r\nimperium.' The reference is to the creation of Decemviri; see Livy, iii.\r\n32.\r\n\r\n20. _so requerable_, in such request: 'expetibilis.'\r\n\r\n29. _into the ... body_: 'in secreta quaeque.'\r\n\r\n32. _the whiche I clepe_, by which I mean; so again below, l. 39.\r\n\r\n35. _a thought_, a mind; 'mentem firma sibi ratione cohaerentem.'\r\n\r\n36. _a free man_; Anaxarchus of Abdera, B.C. 323. The _tyraunt_ was\r\nNicocreon, king of Cyprus. See Valerius Maximus, iii. 3.\r\n\r\n44. _But what_: 'Quid autem est, quod in alium quisquam facere possit, quod\r\nsustinere ab alio ipse non possit?'\r\n\r\n47. _Busirides_, Busiris (gen. case, _Busiridis_), a king of Egypt, who\r\nsacrificed all strangers on his altars. But Hercules, coming to Egypt, slew\r\nhim and abolished the custom. See Vergil, Georg. iii. 5; Ovid, Tr. iii. 11.\r\n39. In the Monkes Tale, B 3293, Chaucer calls him _Busirus_.\r\n\r\n49. _Regulus_; M. Regulus, taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, B.C. 255.\r\nThe story of his embassy to Rome is well known.\r\n\r\n63. _may I._ It is necessary to insert _I_ (only found in the black-letter\r\neditions) to complete the sense. 'Quod quidem de cunctis fortunae muneribus\r\ndignius existimari potest.'\r\n\r\n71. _as of wil_, i.e. when it can: 'ultro.'\r\n\r\n80. _reproeved_, disproved: 'redarguuntur.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 6. 2. _Nero._ Cf. Monkes Tale, B 3653-84.\r\n\r\n4. _his brother_; Britannicus, poisoned by Nero; Tacitus, Annal. xiii. 16;\r\nSuetonius, Nero, 33.\r\n\r\n8. _domesman_, judge; see Monk. Ta. B 3680, and note.\r\n\r\n15. _septem triones_, properly, the seven chief stars in the Lesser Bear;\r\nalso sometimes used of the seven bright stars in the Greater Bear. The\r\nleading star in the Lesser Bear is the pole-star; and as that remains fixed\r\nin the north, the whole constellation came to signify the north. Hence, in\r\nthe Monk. Ta. B 3657, we are told that Nero ruled over 'Both Est and West,\r\nSouth and _Septemtrioun_'; see note to that line.\r\n\r\n18. _Nothus_, Notus, the south wind; see below. _scorkleth_, scorches; MS.\r\nA has _scorchith_. The Prompt. Parv. has: 'Scorkelyn, _ustulo_, _ustillo_';\r\nand 'Scorklyd, _ustillatus_.' As Mr. Bradley notes, it is a variant of\r\n_scorknen_ or _scorpnen_. The orig. Icel. verb is _skorpna_, to become\r\nshrivelled, allied to _skorpinn_, shrivelled. This is a pp. form as if from\r\n_*skerpa_, pt. t. _*skarp_; cf. _skera_, pt. t. _skar_, pp. _skorinn_. The\r\nadj. _skarpr_ means 'sharp,' whence the weak verb _skerpa_, to sharpen. The\r\nsense of the primitive verb _*skerpa_ was, doubtless, 'to cut'; and\r\n_scorklen_ is, lit., 'to cause to be cut about,' when used as a transitive\r\nverb; hence, 'to shrivel up,' from the appearance of plants 'cut' with\r\nfrost or parched with heat.\r\n\r\n21. _Allas!_\r\n\r\n 'Heu grauem sortem, quoties iniquus\r\n  Additur saeuo gladius ueneno!'\r\n\r\nMore correctly, 'lordshippe to venimous crueltee.' MS. C has 'gladius, i.\r\npotestas exercendi gladium'; and 'ueneno, i. venenose crudelitati.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 7. 3. _I have wel desired_: 'materiam gerendis rebus optauimus, quo\r\nne uirtus tacita consenesceret.'\r\n\r\n10. _drawen to governaunce_: 'allicere,' i. e. allure (simply).\r\n\r\n18. _a prikke_, a point; cf. Parl. of Foules, 57; Troil. v. 1815; Ho. Fame,\r\n907. From Ptolemy, Syntaxis, lib. i. cap. 6; cf. Macrobius, In Somnium\r\nScipionis, lib. ii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n23. _Tholomee_, Ptolemy; viz. in the beginning of book ii. of his Megale\r\nSyntaxis. See the same in Pliny, Nat. Hist. ii. 68.\r\n\r\n28. _wel unnethe_, scarcely, hardly at all: 'uix angustissima inhabitandi\r\nhominibus area relinquetur.'\r\n\r\n34. _And also sette_: 'Adde, quod hoc ipsum breuis habitaculi septum plures\r\nincolunt nationes.'\r\n\r\n38. _defaute ... marchaundise_; Lat. only: 'tum conmercii insolentia.'\r\n\r\n41. _Marcus Tullius_, i.e. Cicero, in his Somnium Scipionis, which\r\noriginally formed part of the sixth book of the De Republica. See cap. vi.\r\nof that work, and Note to Parl. Foules, 31.\r\n\r\n43. _Caucasus_; mentioned again in the Wyf of Bathes Tale, D 1140.\r\n\r\n45. _Parthes_, Parthians.\r\n\r\n59. _hath the wrecched_: 'scriptorum inops deleuit obliuio.'\r\n\r\n69. _ended_: 'definitum.' We now say 'finite.'\r\n\r\n73. _endeles_: 'interminabilem.' We now say 'infinite.'\r\n\r\n77. _were thought_, were considered in comparison with eternity.\r\n\r\n89. _This rather man_, this former man, the former.\r\n\r\n95. _seyde_: 'Iam tandem, inquit, intelligis me esse philosophum? Tum ille\r\nnimium mordaciter, Intellexeram, inquit, si tacuisses.' This story is\r\nalluded to in Piers Plowman; see my note to that poem, C. xiv. 226.\r\n\r\n108. _despyseth it_; cf. Troilus, v. 1821-7.\r\n\r\nMETRE 7. 1. _with overthrowing thought_: 'mente praecipiti.'\r\n\r\n3. _shewinge_, evident, open to the view: 'Latè patentes ... plagas.'\r\n\r\n7. _dedly_, mortal, perishable: 'mortali iugo.'\r\n\r\n8. _ferne_, distant: 'remotos.' This is important, as settling the sense of\r\n'ferne halwes' in the Prologue to the Tales, l. 14.\r\n\r\n13. _Fabricius_, the conqueror of Pyrrhus; censor in B.C. 275. _Brutus_,\r\nthe slayer of Cæsar.\r\n\r\n14. _Catoun_, Cato of Utica (B.C. 95-46).\r\n\r\n17. _Liggeth_, lie ye; 'Iacetis.' The imperative mood.\r\n\r\n20. _cruel_; Lat. 'sera,' which Chaucer has taken as 'seua.' 'Cum sera\r\nuobis rapiet hoc etiam dies.' _thanne is_: 'Iam uos secunda mors manet.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 8. 2. _untretable_, not to be treated with, intractable, inexorable:\r\n'inexorabile.'\r\n\r\n7. _unpleyten_, unplait, explain: 'explicare.'\r\n\r\n17. _windinge._ Read _windy_, i.e. unstable; Lat. 'uentosam.' Caxton's\r\nedition has _wyndy_, which proves the point. So also other old black-letter\r\neditions.\r\n\r\n23. _aspre_: 'haec aspera, haec horribilis fortuna.'\r\n\r\n26. _visages_, faces. See Notes to the poem on Fortune.\r\n\r\nMETRE 8. 1. It begins 'Quòd mundus stabile fide Concordes uariat uices;\r\nQuòd pugnantia semina Foedus perpetuum tenent.' The whole of this metre\r\nreappears in Troilus, iii. 1744-1764.\r\n\r\n6. _hath brought_, hath led in, introduced: 'duxerit.'\r\n\r\n_greedy to flowen_; the Lat. text merely has _auidum_; 'Ut fluctus auidum\r\nmare Certo fine coerceat.' The Lat. _fluctus_ answers to 'hise flodes.'\r\n\r\n7. _ende_, boundary: 'fine.'\r\n\r\n8. _termes or boundes_, borders: 'terminos.'\r\n\r\n10. _Love_: 'Et caelo imperitans amor.' On this passage is founded one in\r\nthe Knightes Tale, A 2991-3.\r\n\r\n11. _slakede_, were to relax. The last lines are:--\r\n\r\n 'Et quam nunc socia fide Pulcris motibus incitant,\r\n  Certent soluere machinam. Hic sancto populos quoque\r\n  Iunctos foedere continet: Hic et coniugii sacrum\r\n  Castis nectit amoribus: Hic fidis etiam sua\r\n  Dictat iura sodalibus. O felix hominum genus,\r\n  Si uestros animos amor, Quo caelum regitur, regat!'\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nPROSE 1. 3. _streighte_, pp., i.e. stretched; 'adrectis ... auribus.' The\r\nform _streight-e_ is plural.\r\n\r\n6. _so_, i.e. so much. Better 'how much'; Lat. _quantum_.\r\n\r\n8. _unparigal_, unequal; 'imparem.'\r\n\r\n11. _nat only that_, it is not only the case that. It would be clearer if\r\n_that_ were omitted.\r\n\r\n12. _agrisen_, filled with dread; pp., with short _i_, of _agrysen_. Cf.\r\n_agryseth_, Bk. i. Met. 6, l. 7.\r\n\r\n15. _ravisshedest_, didst greedily receive; 'rapiebas.'\r\n\r\n32. _for the cause of thee_, for thy sake; 'tui caussa.'\r\n\r\n33. _but I wol_, &c.; 'sed quae tibi caussa notior est, eam prius designare\r\nuerbis atque informare conabor.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 1. 2. _hook_, sickle; 'falce.'\r\n\r\n4. _Hony_; cf. Troilus, i. 638, iii. 1219.\r\n\r\n6. _Nothus_, Notus, the South wind. _ploungy_, stormy, rainy; 'imbriferos.'\r\n\r\n9. _bigin_, do thou begin; imperative; 'incipe.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 2. 2. _streite sete_, narrow (retired) seat; 'in angustam sedem.'\r\n\r\n3. _cures_, endeavours; 'omnis mortalium cura.'\r\n\r\n7. _over that_, beyond it; 'ulterius.'\r\n\r\n8. _sovereyn good_; 'omnium summum bonorum.'\r\n\r\n11. _out of ... good_; 'extrinsecus.'\r\n\r\n28. _mesuren_, &c.; 'Plurimi uerò boni fructum gaudio laetitiâque\r\nmetiuntur.'\r\n\r\n34. _is torned_; a bad translation of 'uersatur,' i.e. 'resides.'\r\n\r\n38. _merinesse_, enjoyment; 'iocunditatis.'\r\n\r\n50. _for which_, on which account; 'quare.'\r\n\r\n55. _Epicurus._ See Cant. Tales, Prol. 336-8, where this is quoted; and see\r\nMerch. Ta. E 2021; Troil. iii. 1691; 'Epicurus ... sibi summum bonum\r\nuoluptatem esse constituit.'\r\n\r\n57. _birefte awey._ But the Lat. text has precisely the opposite sense:\r\n'quod caetera omnia iocunditatem animo uideantur adferre.' For _adferre_\r\n[MS. C _afferre_], Chaucer has given us the sense of _auferre_.\r\n\r\n58. _studies_, i.e. endeavours; 'studia.' _corage_; 'animus.'\r\n\r\n59. _al be it_, &c.; 'et si caligante memoria.'\r\n\r\n60. _not_, knows not; 'uelut ebrius, domum quo tramite reuertatur,\r\nignorat.' See Cant. Tales, A 1262.\r\n\r\n67. _that ... it_: 'qui quod sit optimum, id etiam ... putant.'\r\n\r\n75. _forsake_, deny; 'sequestrari nequit.'\r\n\r\n77. _be anguissous_, i.e. 'be _neither_ full of anxiety.' The _neither_ is\r\nimplied in the following _ne_; 'non esse anxiam tristemque.' It is clearer\r\nif we supply _nat_, as in the text.\r\n\r\n83. _Than is it good_, then it is the _summum bonum_.\r\n\r\n86. _lovinge_, as if translating _diligendo_, which occurs in many MSS.;\r\nbut the better reading is 'deligendo,' i.e. selecting.\r\n\r\nMETRE 2. 1. _with slakke ... strenges_; 'fidibus lentis.'\r\n\r\n2. _enclineth and flitteth_; 'flectat.' _flitteth_ here means 'shifts.'\r\n\r\n3. _purveyable_, with provident care; 'prouida.'\r\n\r\n6. _of the contre of Pene_; 'Poeni leones'; lions of North Africa, supposed\r\nto be extremely ferocious.\r\n\r\n8. _sturdy_, cruel, hard; 'trucem ... magistrum.'\r\n\r\n13. _and hir mayster_: 'Primusque lacer dente cruento Domitor rabidas\r\nimbuit iras.'\r\n\r\n15. _Iangelinge_, garrulous; 'garrula.' This passage is imitated twice in\r\nthe Cant. Tales, F 607-617, H 163-174.\r\n\r\n17. _pleyinge bisinesse_; 'ludens cura.'\r\n\r\n19. _agreables_; this form of the pl. adj. is only used in the case of\r\nwords of French origin. Examples are not very common; cf. _reverents_\r\nbelow, Bk. iii. Met. 4, l. 6; and _delitables_, C. T. F 899.\r\n\r\n26. _by privee path_, by an unseen route; 'secreto tramite.' Alluding to\r\nthe apparent passage of the sun below the horizon and, as it were,\r\nunderneath the world. Cf. Troil. iii. 1705.\r\n\r\n27. _Alle thinges_: 'Repetunt proprios quaeque recursus.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 3. 1. _beestes_, animals; 'animalia.' Chaucer always uses _beest_ for\r\n'animal.'\r\n\r\n15. _fals beautee_, a false beauty; 'falsa ... beatitudinis species.' But\r\n'species' may simply mean 'semblance.'\r\n\r\n17. After _axe_, Caxton and Thynne insert _the_, i.e. thee; 'te ipsum.'\r\n\r\n24. _thee lakked_: 'uel aberat quod abesse non uelles, uel aderat quod\r\nadesse noluisses.' This sentence much impressed Chaucer. He again recurs to\r\nit in the Complaint to Pite, 99-104; Parl. Foules, 90, 91; and Complaint to\r\nhis Lady, 47-49. This fact helps to prove the genuineness of the last-named\r\npoem.\r\n\r\n36. _No._ Observe the use of _no_ after a sentence containing _nis nat_. If\r\nthere had been no negative in the preceding sentence, the form would have\r\nbeen _Nay_. Such is the usual rule.\r\n\r\n40, 41. _maken_, cause, bring it about. _bihighten_, promised.\r\n\r\n48. _foreyne ... pletinges_; 'forenses querimoniae.' But _forenses_ means\r\n'public.'\r\n\r\n69. _be fulfild ... and axe any thing_; rather paraphrastic; 'aliquid\r\nposcens opibus expletur.' _fulfild_ here means 'plentifully supplied,' not\r\n'completely satisfied,' whereas in the very next line it means 'completely\r\nsatisfied.'\r\n\r\n71. _I holde me stille, and telle nat_, I say nothing about; 'Taceo.' Seven\r\nE. words for one of Latin.\r\n\r\n74. _what may ... be_, why is it; 'quid est quod,' &c.\r\n\r\nMETRE 3. 1. After _river_, Caxton and Thynne insert _or a gutter_; Lat.\r\n'gurgite.'\r\n\r\n2. _yit sholde it never_. This gives quite a false turn to the translation,\r\nand misses the sense intended. I quote the whole Metre.\r\n\r\n 'Quamuis fluente diues auri gurgite\r\n    Non expleturas cogat auarus opes,\r\n  Oneretque baccis colla rubri litoris;\r\n    Ruraque centeno scindat opima boue:\r\n  Nec cura mordax deserit superstitem,\r\n    Defunctumque leues non comitantur opes.'\r\n\r\n3. _rede see_; lit. 'red shore.' However, the Red Sea is alluded to.\r\nChaucer's translation of _baccis_ by 'stones' is not happy; for 'pearls'\r\nare meant. Cf. Horace, Epod. viii. 14; Sat. ii. 3. 241. Pliny praises the\r\npearls from the Red Sea; Nat. Hist. lib. xii. c. 18.\r\n\r\nPROSE 4. 9. _postum_, short for _apostume_, i.e. imposthume. _boch_, botch,\r\npustule. Lat. _struma_. Catullus is the well-known poet, and the allusion\r\nis to his lines addressed to himself (Carm. 52):--\r\n\r\n 'Quid est, Catulle, quid moraris emori?\r\n  Sella in curuli struma Nonius sedet.'\r\n\r\n14. _Certes, thou_, &c. Rather involved. 'Tu quoque num tandem tot\r\npericulis adduci potuisti, ut cum Decorato gerere magistratum putares, cùm\r\nin eo mentem nequissimi scurrae delatorisque respiceres?' _With_ is used\r\nfor _by_: 'by so many perils' is intended. See Chaucer's gloss.\r\n\r\n16. _Decorat_, Decoratus. He seems to have been in high favour with king\r\nTheodoric, who wrote him a letter which is preserved in Cassiodorus, lib.\r\nv. 31. It is clear that Boethius thought very ill of him.\r\n\r\n32. _that he is despysed_, i.e. _because_ he is despised. The argument is,\r\nthat a wicked man seems the more wicked when he is despised by a very great\r\nnumber of people; and if he be of high rank, his rank makes him more\r\nconspicuous, and therefore the more generally contemned. The MSS. vary\r\nhere; perhaps the scribes did not see their way clearly. See the footnote.\r\n\r\n35. _and ... nat unpunisshed_; 'Verùm non impunè.'\r\n\r\n40. _comen by_, arise from; 'per has umbratiles dignitates non posse\r\ncontingere.' See Chaucer's Balade on Gentilesse, l. 5.\r\n\r\n42. _many maner_, a mistranslation: 'Si quis multiplici consulatu functus.'\r\n\r\n46. _to don his office_, to perform its function. Cf. Wyf of Bathes Tale, D\r\n1144.\r\n\r\n50. _that wenen_, i.e. (folk or people) who suppose.\r\n\r\n56. _provostrie_, i.e. the prætorship; 'praetura.'\r\n\r\n57. _rente_, income; 'et senatorii census grauis sarcina.'\r\n\r\n58. _the office_; this alludes to the _Praefectus annonae_, once an\r\nhonourable title. It was borne by Augustus, when emperor.\r\n\r\n64. _by the opinioun of usaunces_; 'opinione utentium.' Chaucer's phrase\r\nseems to mean 'by estimation of the mode in which it is used.' He should\r\nhave written 'by the opinioun of hem that usen it.'\r\n\r\n66. _of hir wille_, of their own accord (as it were); 'ultro.'\r\n\r\n68. _what is it_; 'quid est, quòd in se expetendae pulcritudinis habeant,\r\nnedum aliis praestent?'\r\n\r\nMETRE 4. Cf. Monkes Tale, B 3653-60.\r\n\r\n2. _Tirie_, Tyre; lit. 'Tyrian,' the adjectival form; 'Tyrio superbus\r\nostro.' So above, Bk. ii. Met. 5, l. 8.\r\n\r\n3. _throf he_, he flourished (lit. throve); 'uigebat.'\r\n\r\n6. _reverents_, the pl. form of the adj. See above, Bk. iii. Met. 2, l. 19.\r\n_unworshipful_, &c.; 'indecores curules.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 5. 1. _regnes_, kingdoms; _familiaritees_, friendships.\r\n\r\n2. _How elles_, why not? 'Quidni?' _whan_, whenever.\r\n\r\n4. _kinges ben chaunged._ This is the subject of Chaucer's Monkes Tale.\r\nExamples are certainly numerous. In the time of Boethius (470-524), they\r\nwere not wanting. Thus Basiliscus, emperor of the East, had a reign which\r\nGibbon describes as 'short and turbulent,' and perished miserably of hunger\r\nin 476; and Odoacer was killed by Theodoric in 493; see Gibbon's History.\r\n\r\n13. _upon thilke syde that_, on whichever side.\r\n\r\n14. _noun-power ... undernethe_; 'impotentia subintrat.' _nounpower_, lack\r\nof power, occurs in P. Plowman, C. xx. 292; see my note.\r\n\r\n17. _A tyraunt_; Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, in Sicily, who caused a\r\nsword to be hung by a slender thread over the head of his favourite\r\nDamocles, to teach him that riches could not make happy the man whose death\r\nwas imminent. See Cicero, Tuscul. v. 21. 6; Horace, Carm. iii. 1. 17;\r\nPersius, Sat. iii. 40. And see Ch. Kn. Tale, A 2029.\r\n\r\n27. _seriaunts_, serjeants (satellite), different from _servauntes_\r\n(seruientium) below. The difference is one of use only; for the form\r\n_seriaunt_, E. _serjeant_, represents the Lat. _seruientem_, whilst\r\n_servaunt_, E. _servant_, represents the O. F. pres. part. of the O. F.\r\nverb _servir_; which comes to much about the same thing.\r\n\r\n30. _what_, why; _what ... anything_ answers to Lat. 'quid.'\r\n\r\n33. _in hool_, &c., whether that power is unimpaired or lost; Lat.\r\n'incolumis ... lapsa.'\r\n\r\n34. _Nero_; see note to Monkes Tale, B 3685.\r\n\r\n35. _Antonius_, a mistake for _Antoninus_, as in the Lat. text. By\r\nAntoninus is meant the infamous emperor Caracalla, on whom Septimius\r\nSeverus had conferred the title of Antoninus. Papinianus was a celebrated\r\nRoman jurist, who was put to death at the command of Caracalla; see Gibbon,\r\nRoman Empire, ch. vi.\r\n\r\n39. _Senek_, Seneca; see Tacitus, Annal. xiv.\r\n\r\n41. _But whan_; 'Sed dum ruituros moles ipsa trahit, neuter, quod uoluit,\r\neffecit.' I.e. neither Papinian nor Seneca found it possible to forego\r\ntheir position.\r\n\r\n48. _Certes, swiche folk_; see Monkes Ta. B 3434-5.\r\n\r\n50. _pestilence_; see Merch. Ta. E. 1784, and 1793-4.\r\n\r\nMETRE 5. 1. For _corage_, Caxton and Thynne have _corages_, but this may be\r\nan alteration due to the Latin which they quote as a heading: 'Qui se uolet\r\nesse potentem, _Animos_,' &c.\r\n\r\n5. _Tyle_; 'ultima Thule.' Supposed to be Iceland, or one of the Shetland\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nPROSE 6. 3. _tragedies_; see note to Cant. Ta. B 3163.\r\n\r\n3, 4. _O glorie._ The original has: [Greek: ô doxa doxa myrioisi dê brotôn,\r\nouden gegôsi bioton ônkôsas megan]. See Euripides, Andromache, 319. For\r\nthis, MS. C. gives, as the Latin equivalent--'o gloria, gloria, in milibus\r\nhominum nichil aliud facta nisi auribus inflatio magna'; an interpretation\r\nwhich Chaucer here follows.\r\n\r\n24. _gentilesse._ See remarks (in the notes) on Chaucer's Balade of\r\nGentilesse.\r\n\r\nMETRE 6. 8. _For yif thou loke your_; the change from _thy_ to _your_ is\r\ndue to the Latin: 'Si promordia _uestra_ Auctoremque Deum _spectes_.'\r\n\r\n9. _forlived_, degenerate; 'degener.' In Prose 6 (above), l. 37, _outrayen\r\nor forliven_ translates 'degenerent.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 7. 1. _delices_; 'uoluptatibus.' The MSS. so confuse the words\r\n_delices_ and _delyts_ that it is hardly possible to say which is meant,\r\nexcept when the Lat. text has _deliciae_. Both E. words seem to correspond\r\nto _uoluptates_.\r\n\r\n12. _Iolitee_: intended to translate 'lasciuiam,' a reading of some MSS.;\r\nMS. C. has this reading, glossed 'voluptatem.' Most MSS. read _lacunam_,\r\ni.e. void, want. _were_, would be; 'foret.'\r\n\r\n14. _that children_: 'nescio quem filios inuenisse tortores.'\r\n\r\n15. _bytinge_; 'mordax.' _anguissous_: 'anxium.'\r\n\r\n16. _or_, ere; in fact, Caxton has _ere_, and Thynne, _er_.\r\n\r\n18. _Euripidis_; in the gen. case, as in the Lat. text. The reference is to\r\nEuripides, Andromache, 418: [Greek: pasi d' anthrôpois ar' ên psychê,\r\ntekn'; hostis d' aut' apeiros ôn psegei, hêsson men algei, dystychôn d'\r\neudaimonei].\r\n\r\nMETRE 7. 3. _he fleeth_: 'Fugit et nimis tenaci Ferit icta corda morsu.' As\r\nto the use of _flyes_ for 'bees,' see note to Parl. Foules, 353.\r\n\r\nPROSE 8. 1. _that thise weyes_: 'quin hae ad beatitudinem uiae deuiae\r\nquaedam sint.'\r\n\r\n8. _supplien_, supplicate, beg: 'danti supplicabis.'\r\n\r\n11. _awaytes_, snares: 'subiectorum insidiis obnoxius periculis\r\nsubiacebis.' _anoyously_; a mistranslation of 'obnoxius,'; see above.\r\n\r\n12. _destrat_, distracted: 'distractus.'\r\n\r\n16. _brotel_, brittle, frail: 'fragilissimae.'\r\n\r\n28. _of the somer-sesoun_: 'uernalium.' So elsewhere, _somer-sesoun_ really\r\nmeans the spring. Cf. P. Plowman, line 1.\r\n\r\n_Aristotle._ The reference is not known; but the belief was common. It is\r\nhighly probable that the fable about the lynx's sharp sight arose from a\r\nconfusion with the sharp sight of Lynceus; and it is Lynceus who is really\r\nmeant in the present passage; 'Lynceis oculis.' Cf. Horace, Sat. i. 2. 90:\r\n\r\n         --'ne corporis optima Lyncei\r\n  Contemplere oculis.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 8. 5. _ginnes_, snares: 'laqueos.'\r\n\r\n7. _Tyrene_; 'Tyrrhena ... uada'; see Vergil, Aen. i. 67.\r\n\r\n14. _echines_: 'uel asperis Praestent echinis litora.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 9. 10. _thorugh a litel clifte_: 'rimulâ.'\r\n\r\n14. _misledeth it and transporteth_: 'traducit.'\r\n\r\n16. _Wenest thou_: 'An tu arbitraris, quod nihilo indigeat, egere\r\npotentia?'\r\n\r\n38. _Consider_: 'Considera uero, ne, quod nihilo indigere, quod\r\npotentissimum, quod honore dignissimum esse concessum est, egere\r\nclaritudine, quam sibi praestare non possit, atque ob id aliqua ex parte\r\nuideatur abiectius.'\r\n\r\n53. _This is a consequence_: 'Consequitur.'\r\n\r\n69. _they ne geten hem_: 'nec portionem, quae nulla est, nec ipsam, quam\r\nminimè affectat, assequitur.'\r\n\r\n77. _that power forleteth_: 'ei, quem ualentia deserit, quem molestia\r\npungit, quem uilitas abicit, quem recondit obscuritas.' Hence _that_ means\r\n'whom,' and refers to the man.\r\n\r\n95. _that shal he not finde._ This is turned into the affirmative instead\r\nof the interrogative form: 'sed num in his eam reperiet, quae\r\ndemonstrauimus, id quod pollicentur, non posse conferre?'\r\n\r\n119. _norie_, pupil; Lat. 'alumne.'\r\n\r\n136. _that lyen_: 'quae autem beatitudinem mentiantur.'\r\n\r\n142. _in Timeo_; 'uti in Timaeo Platoni.' Here Chaucer keeps the words _in\r\nTimaeo_ without alteration, as if they formed the title of Plato's work.\r\nThe passage is: [Greek: all' ô Sôkrates, touto ge dê pantes hosoi kai kata\r\nbrachy sôphrosynês metechousin epi pasê hormê kai smikrou kai megalou\r\npragmatos theon aei pou kalousin] (27 C).\r\n\r\nMETRE 9. 3. _from sin that age hadde biginninge_, since the world began:\r\n'ab aeuo.'  _thou that dwellest_: cf. Kn. Tale, A 3004.\r\n\r\n5. _necesseden_, compelled, as by necessity: 'pepulerunt.'\r\n\r\n6. _floteringe matere_: 'materiae fluitantis'; see below, Pr. xi. 156.\r\n\r\n8. _beringe_, &c.; see Leg. of Good Women, 2229, and note.\r\n\r\n13. _Thou bindest_: 'Tu numeris elementa ligas.'\r\n\r\n14. _colde._ Alluding to the old doctrine of the four elements, with their\r\nqualities. Thus the nature of fire was thought to be _hot_ and _dry_, that\r\nof water _cold_ and _moist_, that of air _cold_ and _dry_, that of earth\r\n_hot_ and _moist_. Cf. Ovid, Met. i. 19:--\r\n\r\n 'Frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis,\r\n  Mollia cum duris, sine pondere habentia pondus.\r\n  Hanc Deus et melior litem Natura diremit ...\r\n  Dissociata locis concordi pace ligauit.'\r\n\r\nSometimes the four elements are represented as lying in four layers; the\r\nearth at the bottom, and above it the water, the air, and the fire, in due\r\norder. This arrangement is here alluded to. Cf. Kn. Ta. A 2992.\r\n\r\n18. _Thou knittest_, &c.\r\n\r\n 'Tu triplicis mediam naturae cuncta mouentem\r\n  Connectens animam per consona membra resoluis.\r\n  Quae cum secta duos motum glomerauit in orbes,\r\n  In semet reditura meat mentemque profundam\r\n  Circuit, et simili conuertit imagine caelum.\r\n  Tu caussis animas paribus uitasque minores\r\n  Prouehis, et leuibus sublimes curribus aptans\r\n  In caelum terramque seris, quas lege benigna\r\n  Ad te conuersas reduci facis igne reuerti.\r\n  Da pater angustam menti conscendere sedem,\r\n  Da fontem lustrare boni, da luce reperta\r\n  In te conspicuos animi defigere uisus.'\r\n\r\n24. _cartes_, vehicles; the bodies which contain the souls.\r\n\r\n34. _berer_: 'uector, dux, semita, terminus idem.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 10. 8. _for that veyn_, in order that vain, &c.\r\n\r\n11. _ne is_, exists. We should now drop the negative after 'deny.' _nis\r\nright as_, is precisely as.\r\n\r\n12. _is proeved_: 'id imminutione perfecti imperfectum esse perhibetur.'\r\n\r\n14. _in every thing general_: 'in quolibet genere.'\r\n\r\n21. _descendeth_: 'in haec extrema atque effeta dilabitur.' Cf. Kn. Ta.\r\n3003-10.\r\n\r\n31, 2. _that nothing nis bettre_, i.e. than whom nothing is better. So\r\nbelow (l. 70) we have--'that nothing nis more worth.'\r\n\r\n32. _nis good_, is good. The _ne_ is due to the preceding 'douted.'\r\n\r\n39. _for as moche_: 'ne in infinitum ratio procedat.'\r\n\r\n51. _this prince_; Caxton and Thynne have _the fader_; Lat. 'patrem.'\r\n\r\n62. _feigne_: 'fingat qui potest.'\r\n\r\n88. _thanne ne may_: 'quare neutrum poterit esse perfectum, cum alterutri\r\nalterum deest.' Thus we must read _may_ (sing.), not _mowen_ (pl.).\r\n\r\n98. _Upon thise thinges_, besides this: 'Super haec.'\r\n\r\n100. _porismes_: '[Greek: porismata]'; corollaries, or deductions from a\r\nforegoing demonstration.\r\n\r\n101. _as a corollarie_: 'ueluti corollarium.' _Corollary_ is derived from\r\n_corolla_, dimin. of _corona_, a garland. It meant money paid for a garland\r\nof flowers; hence, a gift, present, gratuity; and finally, an additional\r\ninference from a proposition. Chaucer gives the explanation _mede of\r\ncoroune_, i.e. gift of a garland.\r\n\r\n106. _they ben maked iust_: these four words must be added to make sense;\r\nit is plain that they were lost by the inadvertence of the scribes. Lat.\r\ntext: 'Sed uti iustitiae adeptione _iusti_, sapientiae sapientes fiunt, ita\r\ndiuinitatem adeptos, Deos fieri simili ratione necesse est.'\r\n\r\n165. _the soverein fyn_; Lat. text: 'ut summa, cardo, atque caussa.'\r\nChaucer seems to have taken _summa_ to be the superl. adjective; and _fyn_,\r\ni.e. end, is meant to represent _cardo_.\r\n\r\nMETRE 10. 8. _Tagus_; the well-known river flowing by Toledo and Lisbon,\r\nonce celebrated for its golden sands; see Ovid, Am. i. 15. 34; Met. ii.\r\n251, &c.\r\n\r\n10. _Hermus_, an auriferous river of Lydia, into which flowed the still\r\nmore celebrated Pactolus. 'Auro turbidus Hermus;' Verg. Georg. ii. 137.\r\n\r\n_rede brinke_: 'rutilante ripa.'\r\n\r\n_Indus_; now the Sind, in N. W. India.\r\n\r\n11. _that medleth_: 'candidis miscens uirides lapillos'; which Chaucer\r\nexplains as mingling _smaragdes_ (emeralds) with _margaretes_ (pearls); see\r\nfootnote on p. 80.\r\n\r\n17. _that eschueth_: 'Vitat obscuras animae ruinas.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 11. 3. _How mochel_; i.e. at what price will you appraise it: 'quanti\r\naestimabis.'\r\n\r\n24. _The thinges thanne_: 'Quae igitur, cùm discrepant, minimè bona sunt;\r\ncùm uero unum esse coeperint, bona fiunt: nonne haec ut bona sint, unitatis\r\nfieri adeptione contingit?'\r\n\r\n55. _non other_; i.e. no other conclusion: 'minimè aliud uidetur.'\r\n\r\n63. _travaileth him_, endeavours: 'tueri salutem laborat.'\r\n\r\n71. _thar thee nat doute_, thou needst not doubt.\r\n\r\n81. _What woltow_: 'Quid, quod omnes, uelut in terras ore demerso trahunt\r\nalimenta radicibus, ac per medullas robur corticemque diffundunt?'\r\n(_maryes_, marrows.)\r\n\r\n91. _renovelen and puplisshen hem_: 'propagentur.'\r\n\r\n92. _that they ne ben_, that they are; the superfluous _ne_ is due to the\r\n_ne_ preceding.\r\n\r\n110. _But fyr_: 'Ignis uero omnem refugit sectionem.'\r\n\r\n112. _wilful_: 'de uoluntariis animae cognoscentis motibus.'\r\n\r\n123. _som-tyme_: 'gignendi opus ... interdum coërcet uoluntas.'\r\n\r\n128. _And thus_: 'Adeò haec sui caritas.'\r\n\r\n142. _for yif that that oon_: 'hoc enim sublato, nec esse quidem cuiquam\r\npermanebit.'\r\n\r\n156. _floteren_, fluctuate, waver; 'fluitabunt'; see above, Met. ix. 6.\r\n\r\n161. _for thou hast_: 'ipsam enim mediae ueritatis notam mente fixisti.'\r\n\r\n163. _in that_, in that thing which: 'in hoc ... quod.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 11. 2. _mis-weyes_, by-paths: 'nullis ... deuiis.'\r\n\r\n_rollen and trenden_: 'reuoluat.' Chaucer here uses the causal verb\r\n_trenden_, to revolve, answering to an A.S. form _*trendan_, causal of a\r\nlost verb _*trindan_. The E. _trund-le_ is from the same strong verb (pp.\r\n_*getrunden_).\r\n\r\n 'Longosque in orbem cogat inflectens motus,\r\n  Animumque doceat quidquid extra molitur\r\n  Suis retrusum possidere thesauris.'\r\n\r\n7. Cf. Troilus, iv. 200.\r\n\r\n8. _lighten_, i.e. shine: 'Lucebit.'\r\n\r\n10. _Glosa._ This gloss is an alternative paraphrase of all that precedes,\r\nfrom the beginning of the Metre.\r\n\r\n32. _Plato_. From Plato's Phaedo, where Socrates says: [Greek: hoti hêmin\r\nhê mathêsis ouk allo ti ê anamnêsis tynchanei ousa] (72 E).\r\n\r\nPROSE 12. 18. _Wendest_, didst ween: 'Mundum, inquit, hunc â Deo regi\r\npaullo antè minimè dubitandum putabas.' Surely Chaucer has quite mistaken\r\nthe construction. He should rather have said: 'Thou wendest, quod she, a\r\nlitel her-biforn that men ne sholden nat doute,' &c.\r\n\r\n19. _nis governed_, is governed; the same construction as before. So also\r\n_but-yif there nere_ = unless there were (l. 25).\r\n\r\n28. _yif ther ne were_: 'nisi unus esset, qui quod nexuit contineret.'\r\n\r\n30. _bringe forth_, bring about, dispose, arrange: 'disponeret.'\r\n\r\n_so ordenee_: 'tam dispositos motus.'\r\n\r\n38. _that thou_: 'ut felicitatis compos, patriam sospes reuisas.'\r\n\r\n55. _a keye and a stere_: 'ueluti quidam clauus atque gubernaculum.' Here\r\nChaucer unluckily translates _clauus_ as if it were _clauis_.\r\n\r\n63. _ne sheweth_: 'non minùs ad contuendum patet'; i.e. is equally plain to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n67. _by the keye_: 'bonitatis clauo'; see note to l. 55.\r\n\r\n73. _It mot nedes be so_: 'Ita, inquam, necesse est; nec beatum regimen\r\nesse uideretur, si quidem detrectantium iugum foret, non obtemperantium\r\nsalus.' The translation has here gone wrong.\r\n\r\n87. _softely_, gently, pleasurably: 'suauiter.'\r\n\r\n91. _so at the laste_: 'ut tandem aliquando stultitiam magna _lacerantem_\r\nsui pudeat.' Another common reading is _latrantem_, but this was evidently\r\nnot the reading in Chaucer's copy; MS. C. has _lacerantem_.\r\n\r\n97. _the poetes._ See Ovid, Met. i. 151-162; Vergil, Georg. i. 277-283.\r\n\r\n116. _Scornest thou me_: 'Ludisne, inquam, me, inextricabilem labyrinthum\r\nrationibus texens, quae nunc quidem, qua egrediaris, introeas; nunc uerò\r\nqua introieris, egrediare; an mirabilem quemdam diuinae simplicitatis orbem\r\ncomplicas?'\r\n\r\n117. _the hous of Dedalus_; used to translate 'labyrinthum.' See Vergil,\r\nAen. vi. 24-30, v. 588. No doubt Boethius borrowed the word\r\n_inextricabilis_ from Aen. vi. 27.\r\n\r\n125. _for which_: 'ex quo neminem beatum fore, nisi qui pariter Deus esset,\r\nquasi munusculum dabas.' Here _munusculum_ refers to _corollarium_, which\r\nChaucer translates by 'a mede of coroune'; see above, Pr. x. 101.\r\n\r\n132. _by the governements_: 'bonitatis gubernaculis.'\r\n\r\n135. _by proeves in cercles and hoomlich knowen_: 'atque haec nullis\r\nextrinsecus sumptis, sed altero ex altero fidem trahente insitis\r\ndomesticisque probationibus.' Chaucer inserts _in cercles and_, by way of\r\nreference to arguments drawn from circles; but the chief argument of this\r\ncharacter really occurs later, viz. in Bk. iv. Pr. vi. 81.\r\n\r\n143. _Parmenides_, a Greek philosopher who, according to Plato, accompanied\r\nZeno to Athens, where he became acquainted with Socrates, who was then but\r\na young man. Plato, in his Sophistes, quotes the line of Parmenides which\r\nis here referred to: [Greek: pantothen eukyklou sphairas enalinkion onkô].\r\nThis the MSS. explain to mean: 'rerum orbem mobilem rotat, dum se immobilem\r\nipsa conseruat.' The Greek quotation is corruptly given in the MSS., but is\r\nrestored by consulting Plato's text (244 E); hence we do not know what\r\nreading Boethius adopted. It can hardly have been the one here given, which\r\nsignifies that God is 'like the mass of a sphere that is well-rounded on\r\nall sides.' Perhaps he took the idea of God's immobility from the next two\r\nverses:--\r\n\r\n  [Greek: messothen isopales pantê, to gar oute ti meizon]\r\n  [Greek: oute bebaioteron pelei.]\r\n\r\ni.e. 'equidistant from the centre in all directions; for there is nothing\r\ngreater (than Him), and nothing more immoveable.'\r\n\r\n152. _Plato._ From Plato's Timaeus, 29 B: [Greek: hôs ara tous logous\r\nhônper eisin exêgêtai, toutôn autôn kai syngeneis ontas]. Chaucer quotes\r\nthis saying twice; see Cant. Tales, A 741-2, H 207-210.\r\n\r\nMETRE 12. 3. _Orpheus._ This well-known story is well told in Vergil,\r\nGeorg. iv. 454-527; and in Ovid, Met. x. 1-85.\r\n\r\n_Trace_, Thrace; as in Cant. Ta. A 1972.\r\n\r\n4. _weeply_, tearful, sorrowful: 'flebilibus.'\r\n\r\n5. _moevable_ should precede _riveres_; 'Silvas currere, mobiles Amnes\r\nstare coegerat.' Chaucer took these two lines separately.\r\n\r\n12. _hevene goddes_, gods of heaven: 'superos.'\r\n\r\n 'Illic blanda sonantibus Chordis carmina temperans\r\n  Quicquid praecipuis deae Matris fontibus hauserat,\r\n  Quod luctus dabat impotens, Quod luctum geminans amor\r\n  Deflet Taenara commouens, Et dulci ueniam prece\r\n  Umbrarum dominos rogat.'\r\n\r\n16. _laved out_, drawn up (as from a well). The M. E. _laven_, to draw up\r\nwater, to pour out, is from the A. S. _lafian_, to pour; for which see\r\nCockayne's A. S. Leechdoms, ii. 124, ii. 74, iii. 48. It is further\r\nillustrated in my Etym. Dict., s. v. _Lavish_, its derivative. No doubt it\r\nwas frequently confused with F. _laver_, to wash; but it is an independent\r\nTeutonic word, allied to G. _laben_. In E. Friesic we find _lafen sük_ or\r\n_laven sük_, to refresh oneself. It is curious that it appears even in so\r\nlate an author as Dryden, who translates Lat. _egerit_ (Ovid, Met. xi. 488)\r\nby _laves_, i.e. bales out. And see _laven_ in Mätzner.\r\n\r\n16. _Calliope._ Orpheus was son of Oeagrus, king of Thrace, and of\r\nCalliope, chief of the Muses; cf. Ovid, Ibis, 484.\r\n\r\n17. _and he song._ This does not very well translate the Latin text; see\r\nnote to l. 12.\r\n\r\n21. _of relesinge_: 'ueniam'; i.e. for the release (of Eurydice).\r\n\r\n22. _Cerberus_, the three-headed dog; cf. Verg. Georg. iv. 483; Aen. vi.\r\n417; Ovid, Met. iv. 449.\r\n\r\n23. _Furies_; the Eumenides; cf. Verg. Georg. iv. 483; Ovid, Met. x. 46.\r\n\r\n26. _Ixion_, who was fastened to an ever-revolving wheel; see Georg. iv.\r\n484; iii. 38; Ovid, Met. iv. 460.\r\n\r\n_overthrowinge_, turning over: 'Non Ixionium caput Velox praecipitat rota.'\r\n\r\n27. _Tantalus_, tormented by perpetual thirst; Ovid, Met. x. 41; iv. 457.\r\n\r\n29. _Tityus_: 'Vultur dum satur est modis Non traxit Tityi iecur.' Cf.\r\nVerg. Aen. vi. 595-600; Ovid, Met. iv. 456. And see Troilus, i. 786-8.\r\n\r\n34. _But we wol_: 'Sed lex dona coërceat.'\r\n\r\n37. _But what_; quoted in Kn. Tale, A 1164.\r\n\r\n42. _and was deed_: 'occidit.' The common story does not involve the\r\nimmediate death of Orpheus.\r\n\r\n49. _loketh_, beholds: 'uidet inferos.' The story of Orpheus is excellently\r\ntold in King Alfred's translation of Boethius, cap. xxxv. §6.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nPROSE 1. 5. _forbrak_, broke off, interrupted: 'abrupi.'\r\n\r\n14. _so as_, seeing that, since: 'cùm.'\r\n\r\n25. _alle thinges may_, is omnipotent: 'potentis omnia.'\r\n\r\n27. _an enbasshinge ... ende_: 'infiniti stuporis.'\r\n\r\n30. _right ordenee_, well ordered: 'dispositissima domo.'\r\n\r\n32. _heried_, praised. This resembles the language of St. Paul; 2 Tim. ii.\r\n20.\r\n\r\n41. _cesen_, cause to cease: 'sopitis querelis.'\r\n\r\n45. _alle thinges_, all things being treated of: 'decursis omnibus.'\r\n\r\n47. _fetheres_, wings; 'pennas.' The A. S. pl. _fethera_ sometimes means\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n50. _sledes_, sleds, i. e. sledges: 'uehiculis.' The Vulgate version of 1\r\nChron. xx. 3 has: 'et fecit super eos tribulas, et _trahas_, et ferrata\r\ncarpenta transire.' Wycliffe translates _trahas_ by _sledis_ (later\r\nversion, _sleddis_).\r\n\r\nMETRE 1. 2-5. Quoted in Ho. Fame, 973-8.\r\n\r\n5. _fyr_, fire. In the old astronomy, the region of air was supposed to be\r\nsurrounded by a region of fire, which Boethius here says was caused by the\r\nswift motion of the ether: 'Quique agili motu calet aetheris Transcendit\r\nignis uerticem.' Beyond this region were the planetary spheres, viz. those\r\nof the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. This\r\nexplains the allusion to the passage of Thought (Imagination) through 'the\r\nhouses that bear the stars' (i. e. planets), in Latin _astriferas domos_,\r\nand so, past the sun, to the seventh sphere of Saturn. After this, Thought\r\nsoars to the eighth sphere, called the Sphere of the Fixed Stars (denoted\r\nbelow by 'the circle of the stars' or 'the firmament'); and after 'wending\r\non the back of it,' i. e. getting beyond it, reaches the _primum mobile_,\r\nwhere 'the lord of kings holds the sceptre of his might.'\r\n\r\n 'Donec in astriferas surgat domos,\r\n    Phoeboque coniungat uias,\r\n  Aut comitetur iter gelidi senis\r\n    Miles corusci sideris;\r\n  Vel quocunque micans nox pingitur,\r\n    Recurrat astri circulum,\r\n  Atque ubi iam exhausti fuerit satis,\r\n    Polum relinquit extimum,\r\n  Dorsaque uelocis premat aetheris\r\n    Compos uerendi luminis.'\r\n\r\n9. _Saturnus_, the planet Saturn; which Chaucer rightly gives as the sense\r\nof 'senis.'\r\n\r\n_and he y-maked_, i.e. and he (Thought) becomes a knight. I hesitate to\r\ninsert _is_ after _he_, because all the authorities omit it; in fact, the\r\nphrase _and he y-maked_ seems to be equivalent to 'he being made.' I do not\r\nunderstand what is meant by 'Miles corusci sideris,' unless it means that\r\nBoethius imagines Thought to become a companion of Mars, and thus to be\r\nmade a soldier, in the service of that bright planet.\r\n\r\n15. _images of sterres_, i.e. constellations, which were fancifully\r\nsupposed to represent various objects.\r\n\r\n18. _worshipful light._ MS. A has _dredefulle clerenesse_. Both are\r\ntranslations of 'uerendi luminis.'\r\n\r\n22. _swifte cart_: 'uolucrem currum.' _Cart_ is sometimes used for car or\r\nchariot.\r\n\r\n25. _but now_, &c. These words are supposed to be spoken by Boethius, when\r\nhe remembers all the truth. 'Haec dices, memini, patria est mihi.'\r\n\r\n26. _heer wol I fastne my degree_: 'hic sistam gradum.' The sense is\r\nrather, 'here will I [_or_, let me] fix my step,' or 'plant my foot'; i.e.\r\nremain. Cf. 'Siste gradum,' i. e. stop; Verg. Aen. vi. 465.\r\n\r\n27. _But yif_:\r\n\r\n 'Quod si terrarum placeat tibi\r\n    Noctem relictam uisere,\r\n  Quos miseri toruos populi timent\r\n    Cernes tyrannos exules.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 2. 1. _owh_, an exclamation; 'Papae.'\r\n\r\n13. _fey_, the faith, the certainty: 'fides.' _sentence_, opinion.\r\n\r\n31. _And in that_: 'Quod uero quisque potest.' _may_, can do.\r\n\r\n38. _lad_, led; _studies_, desires: 'quae diuersis studiis agitur.'\r\n\r\n71. _Yif that_: 'Etsi coniecto, inquam, quid uelis.'\r\n\r\n84. _knit forth_: 'Contexe, inquam, cetera.'\r\n\r\n93. _shewinge_, evident; _is open and shewinge_: 'patet.'\r\n\r\n97. _Iugement._ Evidently meant to translate _iudicium_. But Chaucer\r\nmisread his text, which has _indicium_. 'Idque, ut medici sperare solent,\r\nindicium est erectae iam resistentisque naturae.'\r\n\r\n103. _ledeth hem_, i. e. leads them to: 'qui ne ad hoc quidem peruenire\r\nqueunt, ad quod eos naturalis ducit, ac pene compellit, intentio.'\r\n\r\n104. _And what_: 'Et quid? si hoc tam magno ac pene inuicto praeeuntis\r\nnaturae desererentur auxilio?'\r\n\r\n112. _Ne shrewes_: 'Neque enim leuia aut ludicra praemia petunt, quae\r\nconsequi atque obtinere non possunt.'\r\n\r\n120. _laye_, might lie (subjunctive): 'quo nihil ulterius peruium iaceret\r\nincessui.'\r\n\r\n137. _for to ben_, even to exist. So below, _ben_ frequently means 'to\r\nexist,' as appears from the argument.\r\n\r\n151. _mowen_, have power to act: 'possunt.'\r\n\r\n161. _understonde_, mayest understand: 'ut intelligas.'\r\n\r\n187. _Plato_, viz. in the Gorgias and Alcibiades I, where many of the\r\narguments here used may be found.\r\n\r\nMETRE 2. The subject of this metre is from Plato, De Republica, x.\r\nChaucer's translation begins with the 7th line of the Latin.\r\n\r\n 'Quos uides sedere celsos Solii culmine reges,\r\n  Purpura claros nitente, Septos tristibus armis,\r\n  Ore toruo comminantes, Rabie cordis anhelos,\r\n  Detrahat si quis superbis Vani tegmina cultus,\r\n  Iam uidebit intus arctas Dominos ferre catenas.\r\n  Hinc enim libido uersat Auidis corda uenenis;\r\n  Hinc flagellat ira mentem Fluctus turbida tollens,\r\n  Moeror aut captos fatigat, Aut spes lubrica torquet.\r\n  Ergo, cum caput tot unum Cernas ferre tyrannos,\r\n  Non facit, quod optat, ipse Dominis pressus iniquis.'\r\n\r\n12. _tyrannyes._ This reading (in C ed.) gives the sense better than the\r\nreading _tyrauntis_ (in A); although the latter is quite literal.\r\n\r\nPROSE 3. 7. _stadie_, race-course: 'in stadio'; which Chaucer explains by\r\n'furlong.'\r\n\r\n10. _purposed_, equivalent to _proposed_; 'praemium commune propositum.'\r\n\r\n14. _For which thing_: 'quare probos mores sua praemia non relinquunt.'\r\n\r\n25, 26. _so as_, whereas. _for men_, because men.\r\n\r\n27. _part-les_, without his share of: 'praemii ... expertem.'\r\n\r\n35. _no day_: 'quod nullus deterat dies.'\r\n\r\n39. _undepartable_, inseparable: 'inseparabili poena.'\r\n\r\n49. _may it semen_: 'possuntne sibi supplicii expertes uideri, quos omnium\r\nmalorum extrema nequitia non afficit modò, verumetiam uehementer inficit?'\r\n\r\n70. _under_, beneath, below: 'infra hominis meritum.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 3. 1. _aryvede_, cause to arrive, drove: 'appulit.'\r\n\r\n_the sailes_: 'Vela Neritii ducis;' Chaucer inserts _Ulixes_, i. e.\r\nUlysses. The phrase is from Ovid: 'Dux quoque Neritius,' i. e. Ulysses;\r\nFasti, iv. 69. Neritos was a mountain of Ithaca, the island of Ulysses. MS.\r\nC. reads _Naricii_, which accounts for the form _Narice_.\r\n\r\n3. _Circes_, Circe, as in Ho. Fame, 1272; inserted by Chaucer.\r\n\r\n7. _that oon of hem_: 'Hunc apri facies tegit.'--'One of them, his face is\r\ncovered,' &c.\r\n\r\n9. _Marmorike_: 'Marmaricus leo.' This refers to the country of Barca, on\r\nthe N. African coast, to the W. of Egypt.\r\n\r\n13. _But al-be-it_: 'Sed licet uariis modis Numen Arcadis alitis Obsitum\r\nmiserans ducens Peste soluerit hospitis.' _Arcas ales_, the winged\r\nArcadian, i. e. Mercury, because born on the Arcadian mountain Cyllene.\r\n\r\n16. _algates_, at any rate; _by this_, already.\r\n\r\n19. _akornes of okes_; this is not tautology, for an _acorn_ was,\r\noriginally, any fruit of the field, as the etymology (from _acre_) shews.\r\n\r\n23. _over-light_, too light, too feeble: 'O leuem nimium manum, Nec\r\npotentia gramina, Membra quae ualeant licet, Corda uertere non ualent.'\r\n\r\n32. _for vyces_: 'Dira, quae penitus meant, Nec nocentia corpori Mentis\r\nuulnere saeuiunt.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 4. 2. _ne I ne see nat_: 'nec iniuria dici uideo uitiosos, tametsi\r\nhumani corporis speciem seruent, in belluas tamen animorum qualitate\r\nmutari.' Chaucer's 'as by right' should rather be 'as by wrong.' It means\r\n'I do not see that it is wrongly said.'\r\n\r\n4, 5. _But I nolde_, but I would rather that it were not so with regard to\r\nevil men: 'eis licere noluissem.'\r\n\r\n18. _to mowen don_, to be able to do: 'potuisse.'\r\n\r\n22. _three_, i. e. the triple misfortune of _wishing_ to do evil, of _being\r\nable_ to do it, and of _doing_ it.\r\n\r\n26. _thilke unselinesse_: 'hoc infortunio'; i. e. the ability to sin.\r\n\r\n28. _So shullen_: 'Carebunt, inquit, ocius, quàm uel tu forsitan uelis, uel\r\nilli sese existiment esse carituros.'\r\n\r\n30. _For ther_: 'Neque enim est aliquid in tam breuibus uitae metis ita\r\nserum, quod exspectare longum immortalis praesertim animus putet.'\r\n\r\n39. _by the outtereste_: 'eorum malitiam ... mors extrema finiret.'\r\n\r\n42. _ben perdurable_, i. e. to exist eternally: 'infinitam liquet esse\r\nmiseriam, quam constat esse aeternam.'\r\n\r\n51. _ther is not why_, there is no reason why.\r\n\r\n54. _but of the thinges_: 'sed ex his, quae sumpta sunt, aeque est\r\nnecessarium.'\r\n\r\n64. _but I understande_: 'sed alio quodam modo infeliciores esse improbos\r\narbitror impunitos, tametsi nulla ratio correctionis, nullus respectus\r\nhabeatur exempli.' Thus 'non ensaumple of lokinge' is wrong; it should\r\nrather be 'non lokinge of ensaumple,' i. e. no regard to the example thus\r\nset.\r\n\r\n90. _which defaute_: 'quam iniquitatis merito malum esse confessus es.'\r\nHence 'for the deserte of felonye' means 'when we consider what wickedness\r\ndeserves.'\r\n\r\n102. _to leten_, to leave: 'nullane animarum supplicia ... relinquis?'\r\n\r\n132. _briddes_, i. e. owls. See Parl. Foules, 599.\r\n\r\n142. _right as thou_: 'ueluti si uicibus sordidam humum caelumque\r\nrespicias, cunctis extra cessantibus, ipsa cernendi ratione nunc coeno nunc\r\nsideribus interesse uidearis.'\r\n\r\n153. Wrong. It should rather run: 'sholde we wene that _we_ were blinde?'\r\nLat. 'num uidentes eadem caecos putaremus?'\r\n\r\n193. _in al_, altogether: 'tota,' sc. opera defensorum.\r\n\r\n197, 8. _at any clifte_: 'aliqua rimula.'\r\n\r\n_sawen_, if they should perceive: 'uiderent.'\r\n\r\n200. _right for_: 'compensatione adipiscendae probitatis.' Hence _for to\r\ngeten hem_ means 'of obtaining for themselves.'\r\n\r\n205. _y-leten_, left: 'nullus prorsus odio locus relinquatur.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 4. 1. _What delyteth you_, Why does it delight you? 'Quid tantos\r\niuuat excitare motus?'\r\n\r\nLines 8-10 are put interrogatively in the Latin text.\r\n\r\n9. _and wilnen_: 'Alternisque uolunt perire telis.'\r\n\r\n10. _But the resoun_: 'Non est iusta satis saeuitiae ratio.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 5. 9. _y-shad_, shed, spread abroad: 'transfunditur.'\r\n\r\n20. _hepeth_: 'Nunc stuporem meum Deus rector exaggerat.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 5. The Latin text begins thus:--\r\n\r\n 'Si quis Arcturi sidera nescit\r\n  Propinqua summo cardine labi,\r\n  Cur legat tardus plaustra Boötes,\r\n  Mergatque seras aequore flammas,\r\n  Cum nimis celeres explicet ortus,\r\n  Legem stupebit aetheris alti.'\r\n\r\n1. _sterres of Arcture_, the stars of the constellation Arcturus. Arcturus\r\nwas (as here) another name for Boötes, though it properly meant the\r\nbrightest star in that constellation. It is at no great distance from the\r\nnorth pole, and so appears to revolve round it. The passage, which is\r\nsomewhat obscure, seems to refer to the manner of the rising and setting of\r\nBoötes; and the argument is, that a person ignorant of astronomy, must be\r\npuzzled to understand the laws that rule the motions of the sky.\r\n\r\n3. _the sterre_, the constellation. Chaucer uses _sterre_ in this sense in\r\nseveral passages; see Kn. Tale, A 2059, 2061, and the notes.\r\n\r\n8. _the fulle mone._ This alludes to an eclipse of the moon, as appears\r\nfrom below.\r\n\r\n9. _infect_: 'Infecta metis noctis opacae.'\r\n\r\n_confuse_, confounded, overcome; the light of the moon disappears in a full\r\neclipse, rendering the stars brighter.\r\n\r\n11. _The comune errour_: 'Commouet gentes publicus error.' The people who\r\ndo not understand an eclipse, are excited by it; they bring out basins, and\r\nbeat them with a loud din, to frighten away the spirit that is preying on\r\nthe moon. Chaucer calls them _Corybantes_, but these were the priests of\r\nCybele. Still, they celebrated her rites to the sound of noisy music; and\r\nhe may have been thinking of a passage in Ovid, Fasti, iv. 207-14. C. adds\r\na gloss: 'i. vulgaris error, quo putatur luna incantari.'\r\n\r\n12. _thikke strokes_, frequent strokes. The word resembles _thilke_ in C.,\r\nbecause _lk_ is not unfrequently written for _kk_ in the fifteenth century,\r\nto the confusion of some editors; see my paper on Ghost-words, in the\r\nPhilol. Soc. Trans. 1886, p. 370.\r\n\r\n18. _by quakinge flodes_: 'frementi ... fluctu.'\r\n\r\n23. _alle thinges_: 'Cuncta, quae rara prouehit aetas.'\r\n\r\n24. _troubly errour_: 'nubilus error.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 6. 9. _laven it_, to exhaust the subject: 'cui uix exhausti quidquam\r\nsatis sit.' As to _lave_, see note to Bk. iii. Met. 12-16.\r\n\r\n13. _Ydre_, Hydra; see note below to Met. 7. The form is due to _hydrae_\r\n(MS. _hydre_) in the Latin text.\r\n\r\n_Ne ther ... ende_: 'nec ullus fuerit modus.' _Manere_ is not the sense of\r\n_modus_ here; it rather means _ende_ or 'limit.'\r\n\r\n14. _but-yif_: 'nisi quis eas uiuacissimo mentis igne coërceat.'\r\n\r\n24, 5. _But althogh_: 'Quòd si te musici carminis oblectamenta delectant,\r\nhanc oportet paullisper differas uoluptatem, dum nexas sibi ordine contexo\r\nrationes.' This is said, because this 'Prose' is of unusual length. For\r\n_sibi_, another reading is _tibi_; hence Chaucer's 'weve _to thee_\r\nresouns.'\r\n\r\n30. _muable_, mutable, changeable: 'mutabilium naturarum.' Cf. Kn. Tale, A\r\n2994-3015.\r\n\r\n33. _in the tour_: 'Haec in suae simplicitatis arce composita, multiplicem\r\nrebus gerendis modum statuit.'\r\n\r\n48. _but destinee_: 'fatum uero singula digerit in motum, locis, formis, ac\r\ntemporibus distributa.'\r\n\r\n59. _and ledeth_: 'et quod simpliciter praesentarieque prospexit, per\r\ntemporales ordines ducit.' Cf. Troilus, i. 1065-9.\r\n\r\n67. _by some sowle_; glossed 'anima mundi.' This idea is from Plato, De\r\nLegibus, bk. x: [Greek: psychên dê dioikousan kai enoikousan en hapasi tois\r\npantê kinoumenois môn ou kai ton ouranon anankê dioikein phanai]; (896 D).\r\n\r\n68. _by the celestial_, &c.; alluding to the old astrology.\r\n\r\n81. _a same centre_; i.e. concentric circles, as on a target.\r\n\r\n87. _and yif ther be_: 'si quid uero illi se medio connectat et societ, in\r\nsimplicitatem cogitur, diffundique ac diffluere cessat.'\r\n\r\n93. _laus_, loose; from Icel. _lauss_. Also spelt _loos_, _los_. _it\r\naxeth_: 'quantò illum rerum cardinem uicinius petit.' Thus _it axeth_ is\r\ndue to 'petit,' i.e. seeks, tends to.\r\n\r\n97. _Thanne right swich_: 'Igitur uti est ad intellectum ratiocinatio; ad\r\nid quod est, id quod gignitur; ad aeternitatem tempus; ad puncti medium\r\ncirculus: ita est fati series mobilis ad prouidentiae stabilem\r\nsimplicitatem.'\r\n\r\n108. _whan they passen_: 'cùm ... proficiscantur.' Thus _whan_ should\r\nrather be _so as_, i.e. whereas, because.\r\n\r\n112. _unable to ben ybowed_: 'indeclinabilem caussarum ordinem promat.'\r\n\r\n114. _sholden fleten_: 'res ... temerè fluituras.'\r\n\r\n_For which it is_: 'Quo fit.'\r\n\r\n116. _natheles_: 'nihilominus tamen suus modus ad bonum dirigens cuncta\r\ndisponat.'\r\n\r\n121. _ne the ordre_: 'ne dum ordo de summi boni cardine proficiscens, a suo\r\nquoquam deflectat exordio.' MS. C. has 'deflectatur.'\r\n\r\n123. 'Quae uero, inquies, potest ulla iniquior esse confusio.' For\r\n'iniquior,' MS. C. has the extraordinary reading 'inquiescior,' which\r\nChaucer seems to have tried to translate.\r\n\r\n138. _Ne it ne is nat_: 'Non enim dissimile est miraculum nescienti.'\r\n\r\n145. _hele of corages_: 'animorum salus.'\r\n\r\n148. _lecher_, i.e. leech-er, healer: 'medicator mentium Deus.'\r\n\r\n151. _leneth hem_, gives them: 'quod conuenire nouit, accommodat.' Printed\r\n_leueth_ in Dr. Furnivall's print of MS. C., but _leneth_ in Morris's\r\nedition of MS. A. There is no doubt as to the right reading, because\r\n_accommodare_ and _lenen_ are both used in the sense 'to lend.'\r\n\r\n154. _for to constreine_: 'ut pauca ... perstringam,' i.e. 'to touch\r\nlightly on a few things.' Chaucer has taken it too literally, but his\r\nparaphrase is nearly right.\r\n\r\n157. _right kepinge_: 'aequi seruantissimum.'\r\n\r\n159. _my familer_: 'familiaris noster Lucanus.' Alluding to the famous\r\nline:--'Victrix caussa deis placuit, sed uicta Catoni'; Pharsalia, i. 128.\r\n\r\n168. _with-holden_, retain: 'retinere fortunam.'\r\n\r\n176. _by me_, by my means, by my help: 'Nam ut quidam me quoque\r\nexcellentior ait.' This looks like a slip on the part of Boethius himself,\r\nfor the supposed speaker is Philosophy herself. The philosopher here\r\nalluded to still remains unknown. MS. C. has 'me quidem'; and 'me' is\r\nglossed by 'philosophus per me.'\r\n\r\n177. _in Grek._ Some MSS. have: [Greek: andros hierou sôma dynameis\r\noikodomousi]. There are various readings, but Chaucer had before him only\r\nthe interpretation: 'Viri sacri corpus aedificauerunt uirtutes.' Such is\r\nthe reading in MS. C.\r\n\r\n179. _taken_, delivered, entrusted. 'Fit autem saepe, uti bonis summa rerum\r\ngerenda deferatur.'\r\n\r\n182. _remordeth_: 'remordet,' i.e. plagues, troubles.\r\n\r\n186. _And other folk_: 'Alii plus aequo metuunt, quod ferre possunt.'\r\n\r\n201. _of wikkede merite_: 'eos male meritos omnes existimant.'\r\n\r\n206. _serven to shrewes_: 'famulari saepe improbis.' _I trowe_: 'illud\r\netiam dispensari credo.'\r\n\r\n207, 8. _overthrowinge to yvel_: 'praeceps.'\r\n\r\n209. _egren him_: 'eum ... exacerbare possit.'\r\n\r\n219. _shal be cause_: 'ut exercitii bonis, et malis esset caussa\r\nsupplicii.' Hence _continuacion_ seems to mean 'endurance' or\r\n'continuance.'\r\n\r\n242. _sin that_: the original is in Greek, with (in MS. C.) the false\r\ngloss:--'fortissimus in mundo Deus omnia regit.' The Greek is--[Greek:\r\nArgaleon de me tauta theon hôs pant' agoreuein]. From Homer, Il. xii. 176,\r\nwith the change from [Greek: agoreusai] to [Greek: agoreuein].\r\n\r\n247. _with-holden_, to retain, keep, maintain; 'retinere.'\r\n\r\n253. _ben outrageous or haboundant_: 'abundare.' Hence _outrageous_ is\r\n'superfluous' or 'excessive.'\r\n\r\n257. _and whan_: 'quo refectus, firmior in ulteriora contendas.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 6. 1. 'Si uis celsi iura tonantis Pura sollers cernere mente, Adspice\r\nsummi culmina caeli'; &c.\r\n\r\n5. _cercle_: 'Non Sol ... Gelidum Phoebes impedit axem.'\r\n\r\n6. _Ne the sterre_: 'Nec quae summo uertice mundi Flectit rapidos Ursa\r\nmeatus, Numquam occiduo lota profundo, Cetera cernens sidera mergi, Cupit\r\nOceano tingere flammas.' Hence _deyen_ is to dye, to dip.\r\n\r\n10. _Hesperus_, the evening-star; _Lucifer_, the morning-star.\r\n\r\n13. _And thus_: 'Sic aeternos reficit cursus Alternus amor; sic astrigeris\r\nBellum discors exsulat oris. Haec concordia temperat aequis Elementa modis,\r\nut pugnantia Vicibus cedant humida siccis'; &c.\r\n\r\n20, 1. _in the firste somer-sesoun warminge_: 'uere tepenti.' This is not\r\nthe only place where _uer_ is translated _somer-sesoun_, a phrase used as\r\napplicable to May in P. Plowman, Prol. 1. Another name for 'spring' was\r\n_Lent_ or _Lenten_.\r\n\r\n24. _and thilke_: 'Eadem rapiens condit et aufert Obitu mergens orta\r\nsupremo.'\r\n\r\n29. _And tho_: 'Et quae motu concitat ire, Sistit retrahens, ac uaga\r\nfirmat.'\r\n\r\n31. _For yif_: 'Nam nisi rectos reuocans itus, Flexos iterum cogat in\r\norbes, Quae nunc stabilis continet ordo, Dissepta suo fonte fatiscant.'\r\n\r\n37. _This is_: 'Hic est cunctis communis amor Repetuntque boni fine teneri,\r\nQuia non aliter durare queunt, Nisi conuerso rursus amore Refluant caussae,\r\nquae dedit esse.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 7. 57. _ne also it_: 'ita uir sapiens molestè ferre non debet,\r\nquotiens in fortunae certamen adducitur.'\r\n\r\n60. _matere_, material, source.\r\n\r\n62. _vertu._ Boethius here derives _uirtus_ from _uires_: 'quod suis\r\n_uiribus_ nitens non superetur aduersis.'\r\n\r\n64. _Ne certes_: 'Neque enim uos in prouectu positi uirtutis, diffluere\r\ndeliciis, et emarcescere uoluptate uenistis; proelium cum omni fortuna\r\nnimis acre conseritis, ne uos aut tristis opprimat, aut iucunda corrumpat:\r\nfirmis medium uiribus occupate.'\r\n\r\n72. _in your hand_: 'In uestra enim situm est manu.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 7. 1. _wreker_, avenger; _Attrides_, Atrides, i.e. Agamemnon, son of\r\nAtreus. Chaucer derived the spelling _Agamenon_ from a gloss in MS. C.\r\nGower (C. A. ii. 344) has the same form.\r\n\r\n2. _recovered_: 'Fratris amissos thalamos piauit.'\r\n\r\n5. _Menelaus_, &c.; 'that was his brother Menelaus' wife.' The usual idiom;\r\nsee note to Squieres Tale, E 209.\r\n\r\n9. _doughter_, i.e. Iphigenia; Ovid, Met. xii. 27-38.\r\n\r\n13. _Itacus_: 'Fleuit amissos Ithacus sodales.' The well-known story of\r\nUlysses of Ithaca; from Homer, Od. ix.\r\n\r\n15. _empty_; as if translating 'inani.' But the right reading is _inmani_\r\n(or _immani_); i.e. 'vast.' MS. C. 'inmani,' glossed 'magno.'\r\n\r\n20. _Hercules._ See Monkes Tale, B 3285, and the notes. In the first note,\r\nthis passage from Boethius is given at length.\r\n\r\n21. _Centaures_, Centaurs; Hercules was present at the fight between the\r\nCentauri and Lapithae; Ovid, Met. xii. 541; ix. 191.\r\n\r\n22. _lyoun_, the Nemean lion; Ovid, Met. ix. 197, 235; Her. ix. 61.\r\n\r\n23. _Arpyes_, the Harpies; with reference to the destruction of the\r\nStymphalian birds, who ate human flesh; Met. ix. 187. The gloss in the\r\nfootnote--_in the palude of lyrne_ (in the marsh of Lerna) is a mistake; it\r\nshould refer to the Hydra mentioned below.\r\n\r\n25. _dragoun_, the dragon in the garden of the Hesperides; Met. ix. 190.\r\nThe 'golden metal' refers to the golden apples.\r\n\r\n26. _Cerberus_; Ovid, Met. ix. 185.\r\n\r\n27. _unmeke_, proud; see note to Monkes Tale, B 3293; and Ovid, Met. ix.\r\n194-6. Note that _hors_ (= horses) is plural.\r\n\r\n29. _Ydra_, Hydra; Ovid, Met. ix. 192.\r\n\r\n30. _Achelous_; see the story in Ovid, Met. ix. 1-97. Boethius imitates\r\nOvid, l. 97, viz. 'Et lacerum cornu mediis caput abdidit undis.'\r\n\r\n35. _Antheus_, Antaeus; Ovid, Met. ix. 184. For the story, see Lucan,\r\nPhars. iv. 590-660; Lucan refers to _Lybia_ as the place of combat; l. 582.\r\n\r\n36. _Cacus_; see the story in Ovid, Fasti, i. 543-86.\r\n\r\n39. _boor_, the boar of Erymanthus; Ovid, Her. ix. 87. For _scomes_ (lit.\r\nscums), Caxton and Thynne have _vomes_, for _fomes_ (foams).\r\n\r\n40. _the whiche_, 'which shoulders were fated to sustain (lit. thrust\r\nagainst) the high sphere of heaven.' Alluding to Hercules, when he took the\r\nplace of Atlas.\r\n\r\n45. _nake_, expose your unarmed backs (Lat. nudatis), like one who runs\r\naway. An unarmed man was usually said to be _naked_; as in Othello, v. 2.\r\n258; 2 Hen. VI. iii. 2. 234; &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nPROSE 1. 3. A mistranslation. 'Recta quidem exhortatio, tuaque prorsus\r\nauctoritate dignissima.'\r\n\r\n9. _assoilen to thee the._ I prefer this reading, adopted from Caxton's\r\nedition, because the others make no sense. The original reading was _to the\r\nthe_ (= _to thee the_), as in MS. Ii. 1. 38, whence, by dropping one _the_,\r\nthe reading _to the_ in C. and Ed. MS. A. alters it to _the to the_,\r\nabsurdly. The fact is, that _to thee_ belongs to the next clause. 'Festino,\r\ninquit, debitum promissionis absoluere, uiamque _tibi_,' &c.\r\n\r\n14. _to douten_, to be feared; 'uerendumque est.'\r\n\r\n28. _left, or dwellinge_, left, or remaining (_reliquus_). 'Quis enim ...\r\nlocus esse ullus temeritati reliquus potest?'\r\n\r\n31. _nothing_: 'nihil ex nihilo exsistere.' Referring to the old\r\nsaying:--'Ex nihilo nihil fit.'\r\n\r\n34. _prince and beginnere_ oddly represents Lat. 'principio.' _casten it_,\r\nlaid it down: 'quasi quoddam iecerint fundamentum.' I supply _it_.\r\n\r\n44. _Aristotulis_, Aristotle. The reference is to Aristotle's Physics, bk.\r\nii. ch. 5.\r\n\r\n47. _for grace_, for the sake of; 'gratia.'\r\n\r\n50. _Right as_, just as if. _by cause_, for the purpose.\r\n\r\n55. _ne dolve_, had not digged; subj. mood.\r\n\r\n57. _abregginge._ A mistranslation. 'Hae sunt igitur fortuiti caussae\r\ncompendii'; these then are the causes of this fortuitous acquisition.\r\n_Compendium_ also means 'an abbreviating,' which Chaucer here expresses by\r\n_abbregginge_, introducing at the same time the word 'hap,' to make some\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n66. _uneschuable_, inevitable; 'ineuitabili.'\r\n\r\nMETRE 1. 2. _Achemenie_: 'Rupis Achaemeniae scopulis,' in the crags of the\r\nAchæmenian rock or mountain. _Achaemenius_ signifies 'Persian,' from\r\nAchaemenes, the grandfather of Cyrus; but is here extended to mean\r\nArmenian. The sources of the Tigris and Euphrates are really different,\r\nthough both rise in the mountains of Armenia; they run for a long way at no\r\ngreat distance apart, and at last join.\r\n\r\n3. _fleinge bataile_, the flying troop; with reference to the well-known\r\nParthian habit, of shooting arrows at those who pursue them; see Vergil,\r\nGeorg. iii. 31.\r\n\r\n5. _yif they_, when they; meaning that they _do_ converge.\r\n\r\n9. _and the wateres_: 'Mixtaque fortuitos implicet unda modos: Quae tamen\r\nipsa uagos terrae decliuia cursus Gurgitis et lapsi defluus ordo regit.'\r\n\r\n14. _it suffereth_: 'Fors patitur frenos, ipsaque lege meat.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 2. 4, 5. _destinal_, fatal; 'fatalis.' _corages_, minds.\r\n\r\n10. _thinges ... fleen_, i.e. to be avoided: 'fugienda.'\r\n\r\n13. _is_, i.e. is in, resides in: 'quibus in ipsis inest ratio.'\r\n\r\n14. _ordeyne_, determine: 'constituo.'\r\n\r\n16. _sovereines_, the supreme divine substances. This is a good example of\r\nadjectives of French origin with a plural in _-es_.\r\n\r\n17, 18. _wil_: 'et incorrupta uoluntas.' _might_: 'potestas.'\r\n\r\n27. _talents_, affections: 'affectibus.'\r\n\r\n30. _caitifs_, captive: 'propriâ libertate captiuae.' Ll. 30-34 are\r\nrepeated in Troilus, iv. 963-6; q.v.\r\n\r\n34. _in Greek_: [Greek: pant' ephora kai pant' epakouei]. From Homer,\r\nIliad, iii. 277--[Greek: Êelios th', hos pant' ephoras kai pant'\r\nepakoueis]. Cf. Odys. xii. 323.\r\n\r\nMETRE 2. 1, 2. _with the_, &c.; 'Melliflui ... oris.' _cleer_, bright;\r\nalluding to the common phrase in Homer: [Greek: lampron phaos êelioio]; Il.\r\ni. 605, &c.\r\n\r\n8. _strok_: 'Uno mentis cernit in ictu.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 3. A large portion of this Prose, down to l. 71, is paraphrased in\r\nTroilus, iv. 967-1078; q.v.\r\n\r\n12. _libertee of arbitre_, freedom of will (arbitrii).\r\n\r\n19. _proeve_, approve of: 'Neque ... illam probo rationem.'\r\n\r\n30. _but ... ytravailed_: 'Quasi uero ... laboretur'; which means, rather,\r\n'as if the question were.'\r\n\r\n35. _But I ne_, &c. The translation is here quite wrong; and as in another\r\nplace, Chaucer seems to have read _nitamur_ as _uitamus_. The text has: 'At\r\nnos illud demonstrare nitamur.' The general sense is: 'But let me endeavour\r\nto shew, that, in whatever manner the order of causes be arranged, the\r\nhappening of things foreseen is necessary, although the foreknowledge does\r\nnot seem to impose on future things a necessity of their happening.'\r\n\r\n53. _For althogh that_; cf. Troil. iv. 1051-7, which is clearer.\r\n\r\n55. _therfore ne bityde they nat_, it is not on _that_ account that they\r\nhappen. Cf. 'Nat that it comth for it purveyed is'; Troil. iv. 1053.\r\n\r\n71. _at the laste_, finally: 'Postremò.'\r\n\r\n78. _that I ne wot it._ The _ne_ is superfluous, though in all the copies.\r\nThe sense is--'if I know a thing, it cannot be false (must be true) that I\r\nknow it.'\r\n\r\n80. _wanteth lesing_, is free from falsehood: 'mendacio careat.'\r\n\r\n90, 1. _egaly_, equally: 'aeque.' _indifferently_, impartially.\r\n\r\n94. _Iape-worthy,_ ridiculous: 'ridiculo.' From Horace, Sat. ii. 5. 59--'O\r\nLaërtiade, quicquid dicam, aut erit, aut non.'\r\n\r\n116. _sent_, for _sendeth_, sends: 'mittit.'\r\n\r\n117. _constreineth_: 'futuri cogit certa necessitas.'\r\n\r\n121. _discrecioun_, discernment: 'indiscreta confusio.'\r\n\r\n_And yit_, &c. To make sense, read _than whiche_ for _of the whiche_. The\r\nwhole clause, from _And yit_ down to _wikke_ is expanded from 'Quoque nihil\r\nsceleratius excogitari potest.'\r\n\r\n131. _sin that_: 'quando optanda omnia series indeflexa connectit?'\r\n\r\n141. _that nis nat ... or that_, that cannot be approached before. The\r\nLatin is: 'illique inaccessae luci, prius quoque quam impetrent, ipsa\r\nsupplicandi ratione coniungi.'\r\n\r\n142. _impetren_, ask for it; such is the reading of MS. Ii. 1. 38. A coined\r\nword, from the Lat. _impetrent_; see the last note.\r\n\r\n146. _linage of mankind_, the human race; to which _his_ (its) twice refers\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n147. _a litel her-biforn_; i.e. in Bk. iv. Met. 6. 34, where we find--'they\r\nsholden departen from hir welle, that is to seyn, from hir biginninge, and\r\nfaylen.' See p. 122.\r\n\r\nMETRE 3. 1. _What_, &c.: 'Quaenam discors foedera rerum Caussa resoluit?'\r\n\r\n2. _the coniunccioun_; but this gloss seems to be wrong, for the reference\r\nis rather (as Chaucer, following a sidenote in MS. C., says in l. 5) to\r\nforeknowledge and free will.\r\n\r\n3. _Whiche god_, i.e. what divinity: 'Quis tanta deus Veris statuit bella\r\nduobus?'\r\n\r\n7. _But ther nis._ The Lat. text is put interrogatively: 'An nulla est\r\ndiscordia ueris, Semperque sibi certa cohaerent?'\r\n\r\n10. _by fyr_: 'oppressi luminis igne.'\r\n\r\n12. _But wherefore_: 'Sed cur tanto flagrat amore Veri tectas reperire\r\nnotas?' It thus appears that _y-covered_, i.e. 'that are hidden,' refers to\r\n_thilke notes_, not to _sooth_; cf. l. 15. But the translation is not at\r\nall happy.\r\n\r\n16. _Wot it_: 'Scitne, quod appetit anxia nosse?'\r\n\r\n18. _seith thus_: 'Sed quis nota scire laborat? At si nescit, quid caeca\r\npetit? Quis enim quidquam nescius optet?'\r\n\r\n23. _or who_: 'Aut quis ualeat nescita sequi? Quoue inueniat, quisue\r\nrepertam Queat ignarus noscere formam?'\r\n\r\n26. _But whan_: not a statement, as here taken, but a question. 'An cùm\r\nmentem cerneret altam Pariter summam et singula norat?' The translation is\r\nquite incorrect, and the passage is difficult. The reference seems to be to\r\nthe supposition that the soul, apart from the body, sees both universals\r\nand particulars, but its power in the latter respect is impeded by the\r\nbody; ideas taken from Plato's Meno and Phædo.\r\n\r\n32, 33. _withholdeth_, retains: 'tenet.' _singularitees_, particulars:\r\n'singula.'\r\n\r\n34. _in neither nother_, put for _in ne either ne other_, i.e. not in one\r\nnor in the other; or, in modern English, 'he is neither in one position nor\r\nthe other': 'Neutro est habitu.' This curious phrase is made clearer by\r\ncomparing it with the commoner _either other_. Thus, in P. Plowman, B. v.\r\n148: '_either_ despiseth _other_'; in the same, B. v. 164: '_eyther_ hitte\r\n_other_'; and again, in B. xi. 173: 'that alle manere men .. Louen her\r\n_eyther other_'; and, in B. vii. 138: 'apposeden _either other_'; and\r\nlastly, in B. xvi. 207: '_either_ is _otheres_ Ioye.'\r\n\r\n36. _retreteth_, reconsiders: 'altè uisa _retractans_.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 4. 2. _Marcus Tullius_, i.e. Cicero; De Diuinatione, lib. ii. 60.\r\n\r\n8. _moeven to_: 'ad diuinae praescientiae simplicitatem non potest\r\nadmoueri.'\r\n\r\n15. _y-spended_, spent; but the right sense of the Latin is weighed or\r\nconsidered: 'si prius ea quibus moueris, _expendero_.'\r\n\r\n22. _from elles-where_: 'aliunde'; compare Chaucer's gloss.\r\n\r\n24. _unbityde_, not happen: 'non euenire non possunt.'\r\n\r\n27. _thou thyself._ The reference is to Bk. v. Pr. 3. l. 27, above--'ne it\r\nne bihoveth nat, nedes, that thinges bityden that ben purvyed.'\r\n\r\n28, 9. _what cause_: 'quid est, quod uoluntarii exitus rerum ad certum\r\ncogantur euentum?' _endes_, results: 'exitus;' and so again below.\r\n\r\n30. _by grace of position_, for the sake of a supposition, by way of\r\nsupposition: 'positionis gratia.' Cf. Chaucer's use of _pose_ for 'suppose'\r\nin the next line. The reading _possessioun_ (in both MSS.) is obviously\r\nwrong; it sounds as if taken down from dictation.\r\n\r\n31. _I pose_, I suppose, I put the case: 'statuamus nullam esse\r\npraescientiam.' The words 'per impossibile' are inserted by Chaucer, and\r\nmean, 'to take an impossible case.'\r\n\r\n56. _But, certes, right_; only, indeed, just as, &c. It is difficult to\r\ngive the right force intended; and, probably, Chaucer quite mistook the\r\nsense. 'Quasi uero nos ea, quae prouidentia futura esse praenoscit, non\r\nesse euentura credamus.'\r\n\r\n62. _in the torninge_: 'in quadrigis moderandis atque flectendis.'\r\n\r\n63. _And by_: 'atque ad hunc modum caetera.'\r\n\r\n100. _and for that this thing shal mowen shewen_, and in order that this\r\nmay appear (lit. may be able to appear). The whole clause merely\r\nmeans--'And to make this clearer by an easy example.' Lat. 'Nam ut hoc\r\nbreui liqueat exemplo.'\r\n\r\n101. _roundnesse_ is here in the objective case: 'eandem corporis\r\nrotunditatem aliter uisus aliter tactus agnoscit.'\r\n\r\n107. _And the man_: 'Ipsum quoque hominem.' _wit_, i.e. sense. The 'five\r\nwits' were the five senses.\r\n\r\n113. _spece_, species. _peces_, parts; _in the singuler peces_, i.e. in the\r\nparticular parts.\r\n\r\n114. _intelligence_, understanding; 'intelligentiae.'\r\n\r\n115. _universitee_, that which is universal: 'uniuersitatis ambitum.'\r\n\r\n133. _by a strok_: 'illo uno ictu mentis formaliter.'\r\n\r\n137. _diffinissheth_, defines the universality of her conception.\r\n\r\nMETRE 4. 1. _The Porche_; in Latin, _Porticus_; in Gk.

From Aristotle, On the Parts of Animals, Bk. iv. [Greek: Dio\r\npleionos genomenou tou barous kai tou sômatôdous, anankê rhepein ta sômata\r\npros tên gên] (chap. 10). As to the upright carriage of man, see the same\r\nchapter. Cf. Ovid, Met. i. 84, and see note to Chaucer's 'Truth,' l. 19.\r\n\r\n12. _light_, i.e. not bowed down: 'leuis recto stat corpore.'\r\n\r\n14. _axest_, seemest to seek: 'caelum ... petis.'\r\n\r\nPROSE 6. 21. _as Aristotle demed_; in De Caelo, lib. i.\r\n\r\n33. _present_: 'et sui compos praesens sibi semper assistere.'\r\n\r\n42. _Plato._ This notion is found in Proclus and Plotinus, and other\r\nfollowers of Plato; but Plato himself really expressed a contrary opinion,\r\nviz. that the world had a definite beginning. See his Timæus.\r\n\r\n48. _For this ilke_: 'Hunc enim uitae immobilis praesentarium statum\r\ninfinitus ille temporalium rerum motus imitatur; cumque eum effingere atque\r\naequare non possit, ex immobilitate deficit in motum, et ex simplicitate\r\npraesentiae decrescit in infinitam futuri ac praeteriti quantitatem;' &c.\r\n\r\n53. _disencreseth_; a clumsy form for _decreseth_: 'decrescit.'\r\n\r\n65. _therfor it_: 'infinitum temporis iter arripuit.'\r\n\r\n81. _it is science_: 'sed scientiam nunquam deficientis instantiae rectius\r\naestimabis.'\r\n\r\n82. _For which_: 'Unde non praeuidentia, sed prouidentia, potius dicitur.'\r\nThe footnote to l. 83 is wrong, as Dr. Furnivall's reprint of MS. C. is\r\nhere at fault. That MS. (like MS. Ii. 1. 38) has here the correct reading\r\n'p_re_uydence,' without any gloss at all. The gloss 'p_ro_uidentia' belongs\r\nto the word 'purviaunce.' Hence the reading 'previdence,' which I thought\r\nto be unsupported, is really supported by two good MSS.\r\n\r\n86. _Why axestow ... thanne_: 'Quid igitur postulas?'\r\n\r\n112. _he ne unwot_: 'quod idem exsistendi necessitate carere non nesciat.'\r\n\r\n116. _it ne may nat unbityde_: 'id non euenire non posse.'\r\n\r\n119. _but unnethe_: 'sed cui uix aliquis nisi diuini speculator\r\naccesserit.'\r\n\r\n150, 1. _in beinge_, in coming to pass: 'exsistendo.'\r\n\r\n_by the which_: 'qua prius quam fierent, etiam non euenire potuissent.' MS.\r\nC. has the contraction for 'que,' i.e. 'quae'; but Chaucer clearly adopted\r\nthe reading 'qua.' The usual reading is 'quia' or 'quae.'\r\n\r\n154. _so as they comen_, since they come: 'cum ... eueniant.'\r\n\r\n159. _the sonne arysinge._ See above, p. 148, l. 102: 'Right so,' &c.\r\n\r\n185. _And thilke_: 'illa quoque noscendi uices alternare uideatur?'\r\n\r\n191. _For the devyne_: 'Omne namque futurum diuinus praecurrit intuitus, et\r\nad praesentiam propriae cognitionis retorquet ac reuocat.' Hence _retorneth\r\nhem_ means 'makes them return.'\r\n\r\n193. _ne he ne_: 'nec alternat, ut existimas, nunc hoc, nunc illud\r\npraenoscendi uices; sed uno ictu mutationes tuas manens praeuenit atque\r\ncomplectitur.'\r\n\r\n199. _a litel her-biforn._ See above, Bk. v. Pr. 3, ll. 62-65; &c.\r\n\r\n207. _purposen_, propose, assign: 'proponunt.'\r\n\r\n208. _to the willinges_: 'solutis omni necessitate uoluntatibus.'\r\n\r\n211. _renneth ... with_, concurs with: 'concurrit.'\r\n\r\n214. _put_, set: 'positae.' _that ne mowen_: 'quae cum rectae sunt,\r\ninefficaces esse non possunt.'\r\n\r\n217. _areys thy corage_: 'animum subleuate.' _yilde_: 'humiles preces in\r\nexcelsa porrigite.'\r\n\r\n220. _sin that ye_: 'cum ante oculos agitis iudicis cuncta cernentis.' With\r\nthe word 'cernentis' the Lat. treatise ends.\r\n\r\nThe words--'To whom ... Amen' occur in the Cambridge MS. only; and, in all\r\nprobability, were merely added by the scribe. However, the Latin copy in\r\nthat MS. adds, after 'cernentis,' the following: 'Qui est dominus noster\r\nIesus Christus, cui sit honor et gloria in secula seculorum. AMEN.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO TROILUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nI must refer the student to Mr. Rossetti's work (Chaucer Soc. 1875) for a\r\ndetailed comparison of Chaucer's poem with the _Filostrato_ of Boccaccio.\r\nThe following table roughly indicates the portions of these works which are\r\nmore or less similar, down to the end of Book I. Similar tables are\r\nprefixed to the Notes on the other books. It often happens that a stanza in\r\nChaucer has a mere general resemblance to the corresponding one in\r\nBoccaccio. The lines in Chaucer not mentioned below are, in the main,\r\noriginal; e.g. 1-20, 31-56, &c.; and so are many others that cannot be here\r\nmore exactly specified.\r\n\r\n  CHAUCER: BOOK I.

'That was the son of King Priam of Troy.'\r\n\r\n5. _fro ye_, from you; observe the rime. The form _ye_ is not here the nom.\r\ncase, but the _unemphatic form_ of the acc. _you_; pronounced (y[*e]),\r\nwhere ([*e]) is the indefinite vowel, like the _a_ in _China_. So in Shak.\r\nTwo Gent. iv. 1. 3, 4, we have _about ye_ (unemphatic) in l. 3, and _you_\r\ntwice in l. 4.\r\n\r\n6. _Thesiphone_, Tisiphone, one of the Furies, invoked as being a 'goddess\r\nof torment.' Cf. '_furial_ pyne of helle,' Sq. Ta. F 448.\r\n\r\n13. _fere_, companion; viz. Tisiphone.\r\n\r\n16. 'Nor dare pray to Love,' &c.\r\n\r\n21. Cf. Boccaccio: 'Tuo sia l'onore, e mio si sia l'affanno,' Fil. I. st.\r\n5. And see ll. 1042, 3 below.\r\n\r\n57. Here begins the story; cf. Fil. I. st. 7. Bell remarks that 'a thousand\r\nshippes,' in l. 58, may have been suggested by 'mille carinae' in Verg. Æn.\r\nii. 198; cf. 'anni decem' in the same line, with l. 60.\r\n\r\n67. Read _éxpert_. _Calkas_ is Homer's Calchas, Il. i. 69. He was a Greek,\r\nbut Guido makes him a Trojan, putting him in the place of Homer's Chryses.\r\nSee the allit. Troy-book, 7886.\r\n\r\n70. _Delphicus_, of Delphi; cf. Ovid, Met. ii. 543.\r\n\r\n77. _Ye_, yea. _wolde who-so nolde_, whoever wished it or did not wish it.\r\nThis idiomatic phrase is thus expressed in the MSS. Bell's edition has\r\n_wold who so or nolde_, where the _e_ in _wolde_ is suppressed and the word\r\n_or_ inserted without authority. I hesitate, as an editor, to alter an\r\nidiomatic phrase. Cf. _will he, nill he_, in which there is no _or_.\r\n\r\n91. 'Deserve to be burnt, both skin and bones.'\r\n\r\n99. _Criseyde_; Boccaccio has _Griseida_, answering to Homer's [Greek:\r\nChrysêida], Il. i. 143. It was common, in the Middle Ages, to adopt the\r\naccusative form as the standard one, especially in proper names. Her father\r\nwas Chryses; see note to l. 67. But Benoît de Sainte-Maure calls her\r\n_Briseida_, and _Chryseis_ and _Briseis_ seem to have been confused. The\r\nallit. Troy-book has _Bresaide_; l. 8029.\r\n\r\n119. 'While it well pleases you'; _good_ is used adverbially. Ital. 'mentre\r\nt' aggrada.'\r\n\r\n125. 'And would have done so oftener, if,' &c.\r\n\r\n126. _and hoom_, and (went) home.\r\n\r\n132, 133. This is a curious statement, and Chaucer's object in making it is\r\nnot clear. Boccaccio says expressly that she had neither son nor daughter\r\n(st. 15); and Benoît (l. 12977) calls her 'la pucele.'\r\n\r\n136. _som day_, one day; used quite generally.\r\n\r\n138. 'And thus Fortune wheeled both of them up and down again.' Alluding to\r\nthe wheel of Fortune; see the Ballade on Fortune, l. 46, and note.\r\n\r\n145. _Troyane gestes_, Trojan history; cf. the title of Guido delle\r\nColonne's book, viz. 'Historia Troiana,' which Chaucer certainly consulted,\r\nas shewn by several incidents in the poem.\r\n\r\n146. _Omer_, Homer; whose account was considered untrustworthy by the\r\nmedieval writers; see Ho. Fame, 1477, and note. _Dares_, Dares Phrygius;\r\n_Dyte_, Dictys Cretensis; see notes to Ho. Fame, 1467, 1468. These three\r\nauthors really mean Guido delle Colonne, who professed to follow them.\r\n\r\n153. _Palladion_, the Palladium or sacred image of Pallas, on the keeping\r\nof which the safety of Troy depended. It was stolen from Troy by Diomede\r\nand Ulysses; see Æneid, ii. 166. But Chaucer doubtless read the long\r\naccount in Guido delle Colonne.\r\n\r\n171. Hence Henrysoun, in his Testament of Criseyde, st. 12, calls her 'the\r\nflower and A-per-se Of Troy and Greece.' Cf. 'She was a woman A-per-se,\r\nalon'; Romance of Partenay, 1148. Boccaccio's image is much finer; he says\r\nthat she surpassed other women as the rose does the violet. On the other\r\nhand, l. 175 is Chaucer's own.\r\n\r\n172. _makelees_, matchless, peerless; cf. A.S. _gemaca_.\r\n\r\n189. _lakken_, to blame; see P. Pl. B. v. 132.\r\n\r\n192. _bayten_, feed, feast (metaphorically); E. _bait_.\r\n\r\n205. _Ascaunces_, as if; in l. 292, the Ital. text has _Quasi dicesse_, as\r\nif she said. See Cant. Ta. D 1745, G 838. It is tautological, being formed\r\nfrom E. _as_ and the O.F. _quanses_, as if (Godefroy); so that the literal\r\nforce is 'as as if.'\r\n\r\n210. 'And nevertheless [or, still] he (Cupid) can pluck as proud a peacock\r\n(as was Troilus).' Cf. Prol. A 652.\r\n\r\n214-266. These lines are Chaucer's own.\r\n\r\n217. _falleth_, happens; _ne wenden_, would not expect. In Ray's Proverbs,\r\ned. 1737, p. 279, is a Scotch proverb--'All fails that fools thinks'\r\n(_sic_); which favours the alternative reading given in the footnote.\r\n\r\n218. _Bayard_, a name for a bay horse; see Can. Yem. Ta. G 1413.\r\n\r\n229. _wex a-fere_, became on fire. _Fere_ is a common Southern form, as a\r\nvariant of _fyre_, though _a-fyre_ occurs in Ho. Fame, 1858. The A.S. vowel\r\nis _[=y]_, the A.S. form being _f[=y]r_.\r\n\r\n239. 'Has proved (to be true), and still does so.'\r\n\r\n257. 'The stick that will bend and ply is better than one that breaks.'\r\nCompare the fable of the Oak and the Reed; see bk. ii. 1387.\r\n\r\n266. _ther-to refere_, revert thereto. Halliwell gives: '_Refeere_, to\r\nrevert; _Hoccleve_.' Chaucer here ends his own remarks, and goes back to\r\nthe _Filostrato_.\r\n\r\n292. _Ascaunces_, as if (she said); see note to l. 205.\r\n\r\n316. _awhaped_, amazed, stupefied; see Anelida, 215; Leg. of Good Women,\r\n132, 814, 2321; he was 'not utterly confounded,' but only dazed; cf. l.\r\n322.\r\n\r\n327. _borneth_, burnishes, polishes up; i.e. makes bright and cheerful. The\r\nrime shews that it is a variant spelling of _burneth_; cf. _burned_,\r\nburnished, Ho. Fame, 1387; Kn. Ta. A 1983.\r\n\r\nMS. Harl. 3943 has _vnournith_, an error for _anorneth_, adorns; with a\r\nlike sense.\r\n\r\n333. _Him tit_, to him betideth; _tit_ is for _tydeth_.\r\n\r\n336. _ordre_, sect, brotherhood; a jesting allusion to the religious\r\norders. So also _ruled_ = under a religious rule.\r\n\r\n337. _noun-certeyn_, uncertainty; cf. O.F. _noncerteit_, uncertainty\r\n(Godefroy); _nounpower_, want of power (P. Plowman); and F. _nonchalance_.\r\nAgain spelt _noun-certeyn_, Compl. Venus, 46.\r\n\r\n340. _lay_, law, ordinance; see Sq. Ta. F 18.\r\n\r\n344. 'But observe this--that which ye lovers often avoid, or else do with a\r\ngood intention, often will thy lady misconstrue it,' &c.\r\n\r\n363. _a temple_, i.e. in the temple.\r\n\r\n381. _First_ stands alone in the first foot. Cf. ll. 490, 603, 811.\r\n\r\n385. _Yelt_, short for _yeldeth_, yields.\r\n\r\n394. _writ_, writeth. _Lollius_; Chaucer's reason for the use of this name\r\nis not known. Perhaps we may agree with Dr. Latham, who suggested (in a\r\nletter to the _Athenæum_, Oct. 3, 1868, p. 433), that Chaucer misread this\r\nline in Horace (_Epist._ i. 2. 1), viz. 'Troiani belli scriptorem, maxime\r\n_Lolli_'; and thence derived the notion that Lollius wrote on the Trojan\r\nwar. This becomes the more likely if we suppose that he merely saw this\r\nline quoted apart from the context. Chaucer does not seem to have read\r\nHorace for himself. As a matter of fact, ll. 400-420 are translated from\r\nthe 88th sonnet of Petrarch. See note to Ho. of Fame, 1468. The following\r\nis the text of Petrarch's sonnet:\r\n\r\n 'S'amor non è, che dunque è quel ch' i'sento?\r\n      Ma s'egli è amor, per Dio, che cosa e quale?\r\n      Se buona, ond' è l'effetto aspro mortale?\r\n      Se ria, ond' è si dolce ogni tormento?\r\n  S'a mia voglia ardo, ond' è 'l pianto e'l lamento?\r\n      S'a mal mia grado, il lamentar che vale?\r\n      O viva morte, o dilettoso male,\r\n      Come puoi tanto in me s'io nol consento?\r\n  E s'io 'l consento, a gran torto mi doglio.\r\n      Fra si contrari venti, in frale barca\r\n      Mi trovo in alto mar, senza governo.\r\n  Sì lieve di saver, d'error sì carca\r\n      Ch' i' medesmo non so quel ch'io mi voglio,\r\n      E tremo a mezza state, ardendo il verno.'\r\n\r\nIn l. 401, _whiche_ means 'of what kind.'\r\n\r\n425. Ital. text--'Non so s'io dico a donna, ovvero a dea'; Fil. I. 38. Cf.\r\nÆneid, i. 327. Hence the line in Kn. Ta. A 1101.\r\n\r\n457. _That_; in modern E., we should use _But_, or else _said not_ for\r\n_seyde_.\r\n\r\n463. _Fled-de_ is here a plural form, the pp. being treated as an\r\nadjective. Cf. _sprad-de_, iv. 1422; _whet-te_, v. 1760.\r\n\r\n464. _savacioun_; Ital. 'salute.' Mr. Rossetti thinks that _salute_ here\r\nmeans 'well-being' or 'health'; and perhaps _savacioun_ is intended to mean\r\nthe same, the literal sense being 'safety.'\r\n\r\n465. _fownes_, fawns; see Book of the Duch. 429. It is here used,\r\nmetaphorically, to mean 'young desires' or 'fresh yearnings.' This image is\r\nnot in Boccaccio.\r\n\r\n470. I take the right reading to be _felle_, as in Cm. Ed., with the sense\r\n'destructive.' As it might also mean 'happened,' other MSS. turned it into\r\n_fille_, which makes a most awkward construction. The sense is: 'The sharp\r\ndestructive assaults of the proof of arms [i.e. which afforded proof of\r\nskill in fighting], which Hector and his other brothers performed, not once\r\nmade him move on _that_ account only'; i.e. when he exerted himself, it was\r\nnot for mere fighting's sake. Chaucer uses _fel_ elsewhere; the pl. _felle_\r\nis in Troil. iv. 44; and see Cant. Ta. D 2002, B 2019. For _preve_, proof,\r\nsee l. 690.\r\n\r\n473, 4. _riden_ and _abiden_ (with short _i_) rime with _diden_, and are\r\npast tenses plural. l. 474 is elliptical: 'found (to be) one of the best,\r\nand (one of those who) longest abode where peril was.'\r\n\r\n483. _the deeth_, i.e. the pestilence, the plague.\r\n\r\n488. _title_, a name; he said it was 'a fever.'\r\n\r\n517. _daunce_, i.e. company of dancers. Cf. Ho. Fame, 639, 640.\r\n\r\n530-2. 'For, by my hidden sorrow, (when it is) blased abroad, I shall be\r\nbefooled more, a thousand times, than the fool of whose folly men write\r\nrimes.' No particular reference seems to be intended by l. 532; the Ital.\r\ntext merely has 'più ch' altro,' more than any one.\r\n\r\n557. _attricioun_, attrition. 'An imperfect sorrow for sin, as if a\r\nbruising which does not amount to utter crushing (_contrition_); horror of\r\nsin through fear of punishment ... while _contrition_ has its motive in the\r\nlove of God;' New E. Dict.\r\n\r\n559. _ley on presse_, compress, diminish; cf. Prol. A 81.\r\n\r\n560. _holinesse_, the leanness befitting a holy state.\r\n\r\n626. 'That one, whom excess causes to fare very badly.'\r\n\r\n631-679. Largely original; but, for l. 635, see note to Bk. III. 329.\r\n\r\n638-644. There is a like passage in P. Pl. C. xxi. 209-217. Chaucer,\r\nhowever, here follows Le Roman de la Rose, 21819-40, q.v.\r\n\r\n648. _amayed_, dismayed; O.F. _esmaier_. So in Bk. IV. l. 641.\r\n\r\n654. _Oënone_ seems to have four syllables. MS. H. has _Oonone_; MS. Cm.\r\n_senome_ (over an erasure); MS. Harl. 3943, _Tynome_. Alluding to the\r\nletter of _Oenone_ to Paris in Ovid, Heroid. v.\r\n\r\n659-665. Not at all a literal translation, but it gives the general sense\r\nof Heroid. v. 149-152:\r\n\r\n 'Me miseram, quod amor non est medicabilis herbis!\r\n     Deficior prudens artis ab arte mea.\r\n   Ipse repertor opis uaccas pauisse Pheraeas\r\n     Fertur, et a nostro saucius igne fuit.'\r\n\r\n_Ipse repertor opis_ means Phoebus, who 'first fond art of medicyne;'\r\n_Pheraeas_, i.e. of Pherae, refers to Pherae in Thessaly, the residence of\r\nking Admetus. Admetus gained Alcestis for his wife by the assistance of\r\nApollo, who, according to some accounts, served Admetus out of attachment\r\nto him, or, according to other accounts, because he was condemned to serve\r\na mortal for a year. Chaucer seems to adopt a theory that Apollo loved\r\nAdmetus chiefly for his daughter's sake. The usual story about Apollo is\r\nhis love for Daphne.\r\n\r\n674. 'Even though I had to die by torture;' cf. Kn. Ta. A 1133.\r\n\r\n686. 'Until it pleases him to desist.'\r\n\r\n688. 'To mistrust every one, or to believe every one.'\r\n\r\n694. _The wyse_, Solomon; see Eccles. iv. 10.\r\n\r\n699. _Niobe_; 'lacrimas etiamnum marmora manant;' Ovid, Met. vi. 311.\r\n\r\n705. 'That eke out (increase) their sorrows,' &c.\r\n\r\n707. 'And care not to seek for themselves another cure.'\r\n\r\n708. A proverb; see note to Can. Yem. Ta. G 746.\r\n\r\n713. _harde grace_, misfortune; cf. Cant. Ta. G 665, 1189. Tyrwhitt quotes\r\nEuripides, Herc. Furens, 1250: [Greek: Gemô kakôn dê, kouket' esth' hopou\r\ntethê].\r\n\r\n730, 731. From Boethius, Bk. I. Pr. 2. l. 14, and Pr. 4. l. 2.\r\n\r\n739. 'On whose account he fared so.'\r\n\r\n740. Compare: 'He makes a rod for his own breech'; Hazlitt's Proverbs.\r\n\r\n745. 'For it (love) would sufficiently spring to light of itself.'\r\n\r\n747. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 7595-6.\r\n\r\n763. 'But they do not care to seek a remedy.'\r\n\r\n780. Pronounced _ben'cite_; see note to Cant. Ta. B 1170.\r\n\r\n786. _Ticius_, Tityos. MS. H2. wrongly has _Siciphus_. 'The fowl that\r\nhighte _voltor_, that eteth the stomak or the giser of Tityus, is so\r\nfulfild of his song that it nil eten ne tyren no more;' tr. of Boeth. Bk.\r\nIII. Met. 12. 28. The original has:\r\n\r\n 'Vultur, dum satur est modis,\r\n  Non traxit Tityi iecur.'\r\n\r\nSee also Verg. Æn. vi. 595; Ovid, Met. iv. 456.\r\n\r\n811. First foot deficient, as in ll. 603, 1051, 1069, &c. _winter_, years.\r\nPerhaps imitated from Le Rom. de la Rose, 21145-9.\r\n\r\n846, 847. See Boethius, Bk. ii. Pr. 3. 52-54.\r\n\r\n848. From Boethius, Lib. II. Pr. 1: 'si manere incipit, fors esse\r\ndesistit.' See p. 26 above, l. 83.\r\n\r\n887. 'And, to augment all this the more.'\r\n\r\n890-966. This is all Chaucer's own; so also 994-1008.\r\n\r\n916. _a blaunche fevere_, a fever that turns men white; said jocosely.\r\nLovers were supposed to be pale; Ovid, Art. Am. i. 729. Cotgrave is\r\nsomewhat more precise. He gives: '_Fievres blanches_, the agues wherewith\r\nmaidens that have the green sickness are troubled; hence, _Il a les fievres\r\nblanches_, either he is in love, or sick of wantonness.' In the Cuckoo and\r\nthe Nightingale, l. 41, we find: 'I am so shaken with _the feveres white_.'\r\n\r\n932. _beet_; beat thy breast (to shew thy repentance). Cf. P. Plowm. B. v.\r\n454.\r\n\r\n956. A proverb. 'The more haste, the worse speed (success).' Cf. Bk. iii.\r\n1567, and The Tale of Melibeus, B 2244.\r\n\r\n964. Dr. Köppel says--cf. Albertano of Brescia, Liber de Amore Dei, 45b:\r\n'Iam et Seneca dixit, Non conualescit planta, quae saepe transfertur.'\r\n\r\n969. 'A bon port estes arrivés'; Rom. de la Rose, 12964.\r\n\r\n977. Fil. ii. st. 27: 'Io credo certo, ch' ogni donna in voglia Viva\r\namorosa.'\r\n\r\n1000. _post_, pillar, support; as in Prol. A 214.\r\n\r\n1002. Cf. 'The greater the sinner, the greater the saint.'\r\n\r\n1011. Understand _he_. 'He became, as one may say, untormented of his wo.'\r\n\r\n1024. _cherl_, man. 'You are afraid the man will fall out of the moon!'\r\nAlluding to the old notion that the spots on the moon's surface represent a\r\nman with a bundle of sticks. See the curious poem on this subject in\r\nWright's Specimens of Lyric Poetry, p. 110; also printed in Ritson's\r\nAncient Songs, i. 68, and in Böddeker's Altenglische Dichtungen, p. 176,\r\nwhere a fear is expressed that the man may fall out of the moon. Cf. Temp.\r\nii. 2. 141; Mids. Nt. Dr. v. 1. 249; and see Alex. Neckam, ed. Wright, pp.\r\nxviii, 54.\r\n\r\n1026. 'Why, meddle with that which really concerns you,' i.e. mind your own\r\nbusiness. Some copies needlessly turn this into a question and insert _ne_\r\nbefore _hast_.\r\n\r\n1038. 'And am I to be thy surety?'\r\n\r\n1050. _Scan_: 'And yet m' athink'th ... m'asterte.' The sense is: 'And yet\r\nit repents me that this boast should escape me.'\r\n\r\n1051. Deficient in the first foot: 'Now | Pandáre.' So in l. 1069.\r\n\r\n1052. 'But thou, being wise, thou knowest,' &c. In this line, _thou_ seems\r\nto be emphatic throughout.\r\n\r\n1058. Read _désiróus_; as in Book ii. 1101, and Sq. Ta. F 23.\r\n\r\n1070. _Pandare_ is here trisyllabic; with unelided _-e_.\r\n\r\n1078. The same line occurs in the Clerk. Ta. E 413.\r\n\r\n1088. 'And is partly well eased of the aching of his wound, yet is none the\r\nmore healed; and, like an easy patient (i.e. a patient not in pain), awaits\r\n(lit. abides) the prescription of him that tries to cure him; and thus he\r\nperseveres in his destiny.' _Dryveth forth_ means 'goes on with,' or 'goes\r\nthrough with.' The reading _dryeth_, i.e. endures, is out of place here, as\r\nit implies suffering; whereas, at the present stage, Troilus is extremely\r\nhopeful.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nThe chief correspondences are shewn in the following table.\r\n\r\n  CHAUCER: BOOK II.         FILOSTRATO: BOOK II.\r\n\r\n  ll. 265-6, 274-308.       st. 35-37.\r\n  316-322.                  46.\r\n  391-419, 428-455.         43, 54, 47-56.\r\n  501-523, 540-1.           55-57, 61.\r\n  554-578.                  62-64.\r\n  584-588.                  43.\r\n  589-602.                  65, 66, 68.\r\n  645-665.                  82-88, 71-78.\r\n  733-5, 746-763.           69, 70.\r\n  768-784.                  73, 75-78.\r\n  937-8, 966-981.           79-81, 89.\r\n  995-1010.                 90, 91.\r\n  1044-1104.                93-98, 100-109.\r\n  1125-1232.                109-128.\r\n  1305-1351.                128-131.\r\n\r\nOther passages are mainly original; as, e.g. ll. 1352-1757 at the end, and\r\n1-264 at the beginning.\r\n\r\n1-3. These lines somewhat resemble Dante, Purgat. i. 1-3.\r\n\r\n 'Per correr miglior acqua alza le vele\r\n  Omai la navicella del mio ingegno,\r\n  Che lascia dietro a sè mar sì crudele;' &c.\r\n\r\n7. _calendes_, the introduction to the beginning; see bk. v. l. 1634. Thus\r\nthe 'kalends of January' precede that month, being the period from Dec. 14\r\nto Dec. 31.\r\n\r\n8. _Cleo_; so in most copies; H2. has _Clyo_; Clio, the muse of history.\r\n\r\n14. _Latin_ seems, in this case, to mean Italian, which was called _Latino\r\nvolgare_.\r\n\r\n21. 'A blind man cannot judge well of colours;' a proverb.\r\n\r\n22. Doubtless from Horace's Ars Poetica, 71-3; probably borrowed at\r\nsecond-hand.\r\n\r\n28. A proverb. In the Proverbs of Hendyng, l. 29, we have: 'Ase fele thede,\r\nase fele thewes,' i.e. so many peoples, so many customs. See l. 42 below.\r\nCf. Boethius, Bk. ii. Pr. 7. 49 (p. 47).\r\n\r\n36. _went_, for _wendeth_; i.e. goes; pres. tense.\r\n\r\n46. 'Yet all is told, or must be told.'\r\n\r\n48. _bitit_, for _bitydeth_; i.e. betides, happens.\r\n\r\n55. _Bole_, Bull, the sign Taurus. On the third of May, in Chaucer's time,\r\nthe sun would be in about the 20th degree of Taurus. The epithet _white_ is\r\nfrom Ovid, Met. ii. 852.\r\n\r\n63. _wente_, sb., a turn; i.e. he tossed about.\r\n\r\n64-68. _forshapen_, metamorphosed. Progne was changed into a swallow; Ovid,\r\nMet. vi. 668. Tereus carried off Progne's sister Philomela; see Leg. of\r\nGood Women (Philomela).\r\n\r\n74. 'And knew that the moon was in a good plight (position) for him to take\r\nhis journey.' That is, the moon's position was propitious; see note to Man\r\nof Lawes Tale, B 312.\r\n\r\n77. '_Janus_, god of (the) entry;' see Ovid, Fasti, i. 125.\r\n\r\n81. 'And found (that) she and two other ladies were sitting.' _Sete_ (A. S.\r\n_s[=æ]ton_) is the pt. t. pl., not the pp.\r\n\r\n84. The celebrated story of the Siege of Thebes, known to Chaucer through\r\nthe Thebais of Statius; see bk. v. 1484. And see l. 100.\r\n\r\n87. _Ey_, eh! a note of exclamation, of frequent occurrence in the present\r\npoem.\r\n\r\n103. _lettres rede_, i.e. the rubric describing the contents of the next\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n100-105. Oedipus unwittingly slew his father Laius; and the two sons of\r\nOedipus contended for Thebes. For _Amphiorax_, see note to bk. v. 1500, and\r\nto Anelida, 57.\r\n\r\n108. _bokes twelve_; the 12 Books of the Thebais. The death of Amphioraus\r\nis related at the end of Book vii.\r\n\r\n110. _barbe_, 'part of a woman's dress, still sometimes worn by nuns,\r\nconsisting of a piece of white plaited linen, passed over or under the\r\nchin, and reaching midway to the waist;' New E. Dict. She wore it because\r\nshe was a widow; see the quotations in the New E. Dict., esp. 'wearing of\r\n_barbes_ at funerals.' And see _Barbuta_ in Ducange.\r\n\r\n112. 'Let us perform some rite in honour of May;' see note to Kn. Ta. A\r\n1500.\r\n\r\n117. The right reading is necessarily _sete_, for A. S. _s[=æ]te_, 3 p. s.\r\npt. t. subj. of _sitten_; 'it would befit.' Cf. _seten_, they sat, 81,\r\n1192.\r\n\r\n134. 'And I am your surety,' i.e. you may depend upon me; see bk. i. 1038.\r\n\r\n151. _unkouth_, unknown, strange; hence, very; Sc. _unco'_.\r\n\r\n154. _wal_, wall, defence; _yerde_, rod, scourge, as in bk. i. 740.\r\n\r\n167. From Le Rom. de la Rose, 5684-6:--\r\n\r\n 'Lucan redit, qui moult fu sages,\r\n  C'onques _vertu et grant pooir_\r\n  Ne pot nus _ensemble veoir_.'\r\n\r\nCf. Lucan, Phar. i. 92.\r\n\r\n236. _Withoute_, excepting sweethearts; or, excepting by way of passionate\r\nlove. The latter is the usual sense in Chaucer.\r\n\r\n273. 'Therefore I will endeavour to humour her intelligence.'\r\n\r\n294. _so well bigoon_, so well bestead, so fortunate. Cf. Parl. Foules,\r\n171.\r\n\r\n318. _Which ... his_, whose; cf. _that ... his_, Kn. Ta. A 2710.\r\n\r\n328. 'Then you have fished to some purpose;' ironical. To _fish fair_ is to\r\ncatch many fish.\r\n\r\n329. _What mende ye_, what do you gain, though we both lose?\r\n\r\n344. Gems were supposed to have hidden virtues.\r\n\r\n387. _fele_, find out, investigate.\r\n\r\n391, 2. Cf. Ovid, Art. Amat. ii. 107: 'Ut ameris, amabilis esto.'\r\n\r\n393. In the same, 113, we find: 'Forma bonum fragile est,' &c.\r\n\r\n396. 'Go and love; for, when old, no one will have you.'\r\n\r\n398. 'I am warned too late, when it has past away, quoth Beauty.'\r\n\r\n400. The 'king's fool' got the hint from Ovid, Art. Amat. ii. 118: 'Iam\r\nuenient rugae,' &c.\r\n\r\n403. _crowes feet_, crow's feet; wrinkles at the corners of the eyes; from\r\nthe shape. So in Spenser, Shep. Kal. _December_, 136: 'And by myne eie the\r\ncrow his clawe doth write.'\r\n\r\n408. _breste a wepe_, burst out a-weeping.\r\n\r\n413. _Ret_, for _redeth_, advises; cf. P. Plowman C. iv. 410, and note.\r\n\r\n425. _Pallas_; perhaps invoked with reference to the Palladium of Troy; bk.\r\nI. l. 153. Moreover, Pallas was a virgin goddess.\r\n\r\n434. 'Of me no consideration need be taken.'\r\n\r\n477. 'Except that I will not give him encouragement;' see 1222.\r\n\r\n483. 'But when the cause ceases, the disease ceases.'\r\n\r\n507. _gon_, gone; 'not very long ago.'\r\n\r\n525. _mea culpa_, by my fault; words used in confession: see P. Plowman, B.\r\nv. 77, and note.\r\n\r\n527. _Ledest the fyn_, guidest the end; cf. Boeth. Bk. iv. Pr. 6. 149.\r\n\r\n537. _biwryen_, used in place of _biwreyen_, to bewray. The same rather\r\narbitrary form appears in Parl. Foules, 348.\r\n\r\n539. 'Because men cover them up,' &c.\r\n\r\n586. _were never_, never would be; _were_ is in the subjunctive mood.\r\n\r\n611. _Thascry_, for _The ascry_, the alarm. _Ascry_ occurs in Wyclif, Prov.\r\nvii. 6.\r\n\r\n615. _latis_, lattice. The reading _yates_, gates, is wrong, as shewn by l.\r\n617.\r\n\r\n618. Dardanus, ancestor of Priam. Cf. _Dardanidae_, i. e. Trojans, Verg.\r\nAen. i. 560, ii. 72, &c. Troy had six gates, according to Guido; the\r\nstrongest of these was _Dardanus_; see the allit. Destruction of Troy, ed.\r\nPanton and Donaldson, l. 1557, Lydgate, Siege of Troy, b. ii. c. 11, and\r\nShakespeare's Prologue to his Troilus.\r\n\r\n_ther open is the cheyne_, where the chain is open, or unfastened. Alluding\r\nto the chains sometimes drawn across a street, to block it against\r\nhorsemen. The sense is, 'he will come down _this_ street, because the\r\nothers are blocked.'\r\n\r\n621. _happy_, fortunate. It was a lucky day for him.\r\n\r\n627. _a pas_, at a foot-pace; see Prol. A 825, and l. 620 above.\r\n\r\n637. _an heven_, a beautiful sight; cf. Sq. Ta. F 558.\r\n\r\n639. _tissew_, lace, twisted band; from F. _tistre_, to weave.\r\n\r\n642. The shield was covered with horn, sinews or _nerf_, and skin or\r\n_rind_.\r\n\r\n651. 'Who has given me a love-potion?'\r\n\r\n656. _for pure ashamed_, for being completely ashamed, i.e. for very shame.\r\nA curious idiom.\r\n\r\n666. _envýous_, envious person; accented on _y_, as in l. 857.\r\n\r\n677. _Ma | de_; two syllables. The first foot is imperfect.\r\n\r\n681. The astrological term 'house' has two senses; it sometimes means a\r\nzodiacal sign, as when, e.g. Taurus is called the 'house' or mansion of\r\nVenus; and sometimes it has another sense, as, probably, in the present\r\npassage. See Chaucer's treatise on the Astrolabe, pt. ii. § 37, on 'the\r\nequations of houses.' In the latter case, the whole celestial sphere was\r\ndivided into twelve equal parts, called 'houses,' by great circles passing\r\nthrough the north and south points of the horizon. The first of these,\r\nreckoning upwards from the eastern horizon, was called the _first_ house,\r\nand the _seventh_ house, being opposite to it, was reckoned downwards from\r\nthe western horizon. The _first_ and _seventh_ houses were both considered\r\nvery fortunate; and it is here said that Venus was in her seventh house,\r\ni.e. was just below the western horizon at the moment when Criseyde first\r\nsaw him. The same planet was also 'well disposed,' i.e. in a favourable\r\nsign of the zodiac; and at the same time was 'pleased (or made propitious)\r\nby favourable aspects' of other planets, i.e. other planets were favourably\r\nsituated as regards their angular distances from Venus. Moreover, Venus was\r\nno foe to Troilus in his nativity, i.e. she was also favourably situated at\r\nthe moment of his birth.\r\n\r\n716. Imitated from Le Rom. de la Rose, 5765-9, q.v.\r\n\r\n746. 'I am one (who is) the fairest.' The _-e_ in _fairest-e_ is not\r\nelided; neither is the _-e_ in _wist-e_ in l. 745.\r\n\r\n750. I.e. 'I am my own mistress.'\r\n\r\n752. _lese_, pasture; 'I stand, unfastened, in a pleasant pasture.' From A.\r\nS. _l[=æ]su_. Cf. Ho. Fame, 1768. It does not mean 'leash,' as usually\r\nsaid; Chaucer's form of 'leash' is _lees_, as in Cant. Ta. G 19.\r\n\r\n754. _chekmat_, check-mate, as in chess; see Book Duch. 659. Bell sees a\r\npun in it; '_check_ to my _mate_,' i.e. wife; but it remains to be shewn\r\nthat the form _mate_ (wife) was known to Chaucer, who spells it _make_\r\n(Cant. Ta. E 2080).\r\n\r\n759. I.e. 'I am not a nun,' nor vowed to chastity.\r\n\r\n767, 769. _sprat_, for _spredeth_, spreads, pres. t.; _spradde_, pt. t. Cf.\r\nBoethius, Bk. i. Met. 3. 9-12.\r\n\r\n777. According to Bell, MS. Harl. 1239 also has _why_, i.e. wherefore, a\r\nreason why, cause.\r\n\r\n784. Cf. 'S'il fait folie, si la boive;' Rom. Rose, 12844.\r\n\r\n797. 'No one stumbles over it;' for it is too unsubstantial.\r\n\r\n802. 'Yet all things seem to them to be harmful, wherein folks please their\r\nfriends.'\r\n\r\n807. 'Nothing venture, nothing have.'\r\n\r\n830. _hertes lust_, heart's pleasure; _to rente_, by way of rent.\r\n\r\n831. _no wight_, to no one; dat. case.\r\n\r\n861. See Hazlitt's notes on the proverb--'Many talk of Robin Hood, that\r\nnever shot in his bow,' &c.\r\n\r\n866. 'Who cannot endure sorrow deserves no joy.'\r\n\r\n867. 'And therefore let him, who has a glass head, beware of stones cast in\r\nbattle.'\r\n\r\n882. _let_, short for _ledeth_, leads (Stratmann).\r\n\r\n884. The MSS. end the line with _syke_. It has been pointed out that _syke_\r\nis not a perfect rime to _endyte_, _whyte_, but only an assonance. It is\r\ndifficult to believe Chaucer guilty of this oversight; and hence I would\r\nsuggest, with all submission to the critics, that possibly Chaucer wrote\r\n_syte_. The M. E. _syte_ means to be anxious, and occurs in the Cursor\r\nMundi, 11675; where Joseph says to Mary:--'Bot I _site_ for an other thing\r\nThat we o water has nu wanting,' i.e. but I am anxious about another thing,\r\nthat we lack water. The sb. _site_, grief, occurs in the Midland dialect as\r\nwell as in Northumbrian; see _site_ in Stratmann. As the word is unusual,\r\nit would naturally be altered by the scribes to the familiar _syke_, to\r\nsigh, with a cognate meaning.\r\n\r\n920. 'And loude he song ageyn the sonne shene;' Kn. Ta. A 1509.\r\n\r\n959. 'Unless lack of pursuit is the cause (of failure),' &c.; cf. 1075.\r\n\r\n964. _hameled_, cut off, docked; cf. P. Pl. Crede, 300.\r\n\r\n1001. 'Your ill hap is not owing to me.'\r\n\r\n1017. Read _And úpon mé_, where _me_ is emphatic.\r\n\r\n1022. When people's ears glow, it is because they are being talked of;\r\naccording to folk-lore. See Brand's Popular Antiquities, ed. Ellis, iii.\r\n171.\r\n\r\n1026. 'Sed lateant uires, nec sis in fronte disertus;' Ovid, Art. Am. i.\r\n463.\r\n\r\n1027. 'Quascunque adspicies, lacrimae fecere lituras;' Ovid, Heroid. iii.\r\n3.\r\n\r\n1033. 'Or always harp one tune.'\r\n\r\n1041. 'Humano capiti,' &c.; Horace, Ars Poet. 1-5. _pyk_, a pike (fish), as\r\nin the Balade to Rosemounde, 17.\r\n\r\n1062. Accent _Mínervá_ on the first and third syllables.\r\n\r\n1075-7. _it made_, was the cause of it. _ley_, lied.\r\n\r\n1107. _hoppe_, dance. 'I always dance in the rear.'\r\n\r\n1108. _to-laugh_ (H2, _to lagh_, Cm. _to law_), laughed exceedingly. I know\r\nof no other example. A better form is _to-lough_; see l. 1163, and Pard.\r\nTa. C 476.\r\n\r\n1119. _spek-e_, might speak, should say; pt. t. subjunctive.\r\n\r\n1123. _sent_, i. e. _sendeth_, sends; the pt. t. is _sent-e_ or _send-e_.\r\n\r\n1177-8. _Avysed_, she took notice; pt. tense. So also _fond_, found, which\r\nBell takes to be a pp.; but the pp. is _founden_. _Coude good_, knew what\r\nwas becoming. So, in l. 1197, _Can he_ means 'has he skill.'\r\n\r\n1201, 1204. _sowe_, to sew the pieces of parchment together. Tyrwhitt\r\nremarks, s. v. _sowe_; 'It was usual, and indeed necessary, formerly to\r\n_sew_ letters, when they were written upon parchment; but the practice\r\ncontinued long after the invention of paper.' _plyte_, to fold it up.\r\n\r\n1229. 'A cushion, beaten with gold;' cf. Kn. Ta. A 979.\r\n\r\n1238. A proverb: 'slight impressions soon fade.'\r\n\r\n1249. Tyrwhitt, s. v. _somme_, boggles over this line, but it is quite\r\nright. Bell takes occasion to speak of the 'rugged lines' to be found in\r\nthis poem; which is true enough of his own peculiar text. In Beowulf, l.\r\n207, we have _fift[=e]na sum_, one of fifteen, where the cardinal number is\r\nused; and this is the usual idiom. But the ordinal number is used also. In\r\nSt. Juliana, p. 79, we read that 'te sea sencte him on his _thrituthe\r\nsum_,' the sea drowned him and 'thirtieth some' of his men, which I\r\nunderstand to mean 'and twenty-nine of his men,' the master being the\r\nthirtieth; but Mr. Cockayne and Mr. Bradley make it mean 'him and thirty\r\nothers.' So again, in Sir Tristrem, 817, we have: 'He busked and made him\r\nyare hi[s] _fiftend som_ of knight,' he made ready for himself his\r\n'fifteenth some' of knights, which I should explain to mean a band of\r\nfifteen knights, _himself included_, or, himself being the fifteenth.\r\n_Some_ in such phrases has a collective force. However, the examples in\r\nBosworth and Toller's A. S. Dict., s. v. _sum_, shew that this mode of\r\nexpression is also sometimes used _exclusively_ of the leader.\r\n\r\n1274. _on to pyke_, for her to pick upon, or pick at; i. e. for her to pull\r\nout; see l. 1273. See examples in Halliwell, s. v. _pike_, of 'to _pyke\r\nout_ thornes,' to pick out thorns.\r\n\r\n1276. Cf. 'to strike while the iron is hot;' see Melibeus, B 2226.\r\n\r\n1289. 'But therein he had much to heave at and to do.'\r\n\r\n1291. 'And why? for fear of shame.' Cm. has _for speche_, i. e. for fear of\r\ntalk or scandal.\r\n\r\n1315. _accesse_, attack, as of fever. See New E. Dict.\r\n\r\n1343. _refreyde_, grow cool; cf. Balade to Rosemounde, l. 21.\r\n\r\n1349. _after his gestes_, according to his deeds, or adventures.\r\n\r\n1390. _forbyse_, to give (thee) instances. Hardly a correct form; it should\r\nrather be _forbysne_, short for _forbysnen_, as the verb is formed from the\r\nsb. _forbysne_, A. S. _foreb[=y]sen_, an example, instance. The word was\r\nobsolescent.\r\n\r\n1398. _Deiphebus_ (= _Dé'ph[)e]bús)_ is always trisyllabic.\r\n\r\n1410. He means that he would do more for him than for any one, 'except for\r\nhim whom he loves most,' i. e. Troilus.\r\n\r\n1427. 'With spur and whip,' i. e. with all expedition.\r\n\r\n1495. _word and ende_, beginning and end; cf. iii. 702, v. 1669. The right\r\nphrase is _ord and ende_, where _ord_ is 'beginning;' but it would seem\r\nthat, by Chaucer's time, _word_ had been corruptly substituted for the\r\nobsolescent _ord_. See Monk. Ta. B 3911, and the note.\r\n\r\n1534. _triste_, station for a huntsman to shoot from. See _Tristre_ in\r\nStratmann.\r\n\r\n1554. _renne_, to run, like an excited madman.\r\n\r\n1564. 'Bon fait prolixite foïr;' Rom. de la Rose, 18498.\r\n\r\n1581. 'Although it does not please her to recommend (a remedy).'\r\n\r\n1594. _To mowen_, to have it in her power; A. S. _mugan_.\r\n\r\n1650. _for my bettre arm_, not even to save my right arm.\r\n\r\n1661. _him thar nought_, 'him needeth not,' he need not do.\r\n\r\n1735. An obscure allusion. 'Perhaps it means, in regard for the king and\r\nqueen, his parents;' Bell. My own guess is different. I think it quite\r\npossible that Chaucer is referring to the two 'crowns' or garlands, one of\r\nroses and one of lilies, about which so much is said in his early work\r\nentitled the _Lyf of Seint Cecile_, afterwards called the Second Nonnes\r\nTale (see G 270). Thus Pandarus, with his usual impudence, conjures\r\nCriseyde to pity Troilus by two solemn adjurations, viz. for the sake of\r\nHim who gave us all our souls, and by the virtue of the two heavenly crowns\r\nwhich an angel once brought _to a chaste couple_. He thus boldly insinuates\r\nthat the proposed meeting is of the most innocent character. This I take to\r\nbe the whole point of the allusion.\r\n\r\n1737. 'Fie on the devil!' I. e. despise detraction.\r\n\r\n1738. _com of_, come off; we _now_ say 'come on!' See ll. 1742, 1750.\r\n\r\n1751. 'But now (I appeal) to you.'\r\n\r\n1752. _cankedort_, a state of suspense, uncertainty, or anxiety; as appears\r\nfrom the context. The word occurs nowhere else. Only one MS. (H2) has the\r\nspelling _kankerdort_, usually adopted in modern editions; Thynne has\r\n_cankedorte_, but it needs no final _e_. The etymology is unknown nor do we\r\neven know how to divide it. There is a verb _kanka_, to shake, be unsteady,\r\n&c., in Swedish dialects (Rietz), and the Swed. _ort_ is a place, quarter;\r\nif there is any relationship, _kanked-ort_ might mean 'shaky place,' or\r\nticklish position. Another theory is that _canker_ relates to _canker_, a\r\ncancer, disease, and that _dort_ is related to Lowl. Sc. _dort_, sulkiness.\r\nBut this is assuming that the right spelling is _canker-dort_, a theory\r\nwhich the MSS. do not favour. Neither does the sense of 'ill-humour' seem\r\nvery suitable. As I am bound, in this difficult case, to suggest what I\r\ncan, I must add that it is also possible to suppose that _cankedort_ is of\r\nFrench origin, answering to an O. F. _quant que dort_, lit. 'whenever he is\r\nasleep (?),' or 'although he is asleep(?);' and hence (conceivably) meaning\r\n'in a sleepy state.' The phrase _quant que_, also spelt _kan ke_ (and in\r\nmany other ways) is illustrated by a column of examples in Godefroy's\r\nDictionary; but its usual sense is 'as well as,' or 'whatever'; thus _kan\r\nke poet_ = as well as he can. Or can we make it = _com ki dort_, like one\r\nwho sleeps?\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nThe following scheme gives a general idea of the relationship of this Book\r\nto the original.\r\n\r\n  CHAUCER: BOOK III.      FILOSTRATO: BOOK III.\r\n  ll. 1-38.               st. 74-79.\r\n  239-287.                5-10.\r\n  344-441.                11-20.\r\n  813-833.                [Boethius, II.

This is an exceptionally difficult passage, and some of the editions\r\nmake great nonsense of it, especially of ll. 15-21. It is, however,\r\nimitated from stanzas 74-79 of the Filostrato, Book III; where the\r\ninvocation is put into the mouth of Troilus.\r\n\r\nThe key to it is that it is an address to _Venus_, both the planet and the\r\ngoddess.\r\n\r\n2. The planet Venus was considered to be in 'the _third_ heaven.' The\r\n'heavens' or spheres were named, respectively, after the Moon, Mercury,\r\nVenus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the 'fixed stars;' beyond which was\r\nthe Primum Mobile, the earth being in the centre of all, and immoveable.\r\nSometimes the spheres of the seven planets were reckoned backwards from\r\nSaturn, Venus being then in the _fifth_ heaven; see Lenvoy a Scogan, 9, and\r\nthe note.\r\n\r\n3. 'O favourite of the Sun, O dear daughter of Jove!' Venus was considered\r\na fortunate planet. Perhaps it is best to quote the Italian text here:--\r\n\r\n 'O luce eterna, il cui lieto splendore                                 585\r\n  Fa bello il terzo ciel, dal qual ne piove\r\n  Piacer, vaghezza, pietade ed amore;\r\n  Del sole amica, e figliuola di Giove,\r\n  Benigna donna d'ogni gentil core,\r\n  Certa cagion del valor che mi muove                                   590\r\n  A' sospir dolci della mia salute,\r\n  Sempre lodata sia la tua virtute.\r\n\r\n  Il ciel, la terra, lo mare e l'inferno\r\n  Ciascuno in sè la tua potenzia sente,\r\n  O chiara luce; e s'io il ver discerno,                                595\r\n  Le piante, i semi, e l'erbe puramente,\r\n  Gli uccei, le fiere, i pesci con eterno\r\n  Vapor ti senton nel tempo piacente,\r\n  E gli uomini e gli dei, nè creatura\r\n  Senza di te nel mondo vale o dura.                                    600\r\n\r\n  Tu Giove prima agli alti affetti lieto,\r\n  Pe' qua' vivono e son tutte le cose,\r\n  Movesti, o bella dea; e mansueto\r\n  Sovente il rendi all' opere noiose\r\n  Di noi mortali; e il meritato fleto                                   605\r\n  In liete feste volgi e dilettose;\r\n  E in mille forme già quaggiù il mandasti,\r\n  Quand' ora d'una ed or d'altra il pregasti.\r\n\r\n11. _vapour_, influence; Ital. _Vapor_ (l. 598).\r\n\r\n15. The readings in this stanza are settled by the Ital. text. Thus, in ll.\r\n17, 19, 20, read _him_, not _hem_. _Comeveden_, didst move or instigate;\r\nagreeing with _ye_, for which Mod. E. uses _thou_. 'Thou didst first\r\ninstigate Jove to those glad effects (influences), through which all things\r\nlive and exist; and didst make him amorous of mortal things; and, at thy\r\npleasure, didst ever give him, in love, success or trouble; and, in a\r\nthousand forms, didst send him down to (gain) love on earth; and he caught\r\nthose whom it pleased you (he should catch).'\r\n\r\nIn l. 17 we find _Comeveden_ sometimes turned into _Comenden_, or even\r\n_Commodious_! The Italian text has _Movesti_ (l. 603).\r\n\r\n22. Venus was supposed to appease the angry planet Mars; see Compl. of\r\nMars, 36-42.\r\n\r\n27. 'According as a man wishes.'\r\n\r\n29. 'Tu in unità le case e li cittadi, Li regni, ... Tien.'\r\n\r\n31-34.\r\n\r\n 'Tu sola le nascosi qualitadi\r\n  Delle cose conosci, onde 'l costrutto\r\n  Vi metti tal, che fai maravigliare\r\n  Chi tua potenza non sa riguardare.'\r\n\r\nI. e. 'Thou only knowest the hidden qualities of things, whence thou\r\nformest such a construction, that thou makest to marvel any one who knows\r\nnot how to estimate thy power.' Chaucer seems to have used _construe_\r\nbecause suggested by _costrutto_, but he really uses it as answering to\r\n_sa_ (in the fourth line), and omits the words _'l costrutto vi metti tal_\r\naltogether. Hence ll. 33-35 mean: 'when they cannot explain how it may come\r\nto pass that _she_ loves _him_, or why _he_ loves _her_; (so as to shew)\r\nwhy _this_ fish, and not _that_ one, comes to the weir.'\r\n\r\n_Io_ (= _jo_), come to pass. This word is not in the dictionaries, and has\r\nbeen coolly altered into _go_ (!) in various editions. But it answers to O.\r\nF. _joer_ (F. _jouer_), to play, hence, to play a game, to make a move (as\r\nin a game); here, to come about, come to pass.\r\n\r\n35. _were_, weir, pool where fish are caught; see Parl. Foules, 138, and\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n36. 'You have imposed a law on folks in this universe;' Ital. 'Tu legge, o\r\ndea, poni all' universo.'\r\n\r\n44, 45. _Inhelde_, pour in. _Caliope_, Calliope, muse of epic poetry;\r\nsimilarly invoked by Dante, Purg. i. 9.\r\n\r\n87. 'Though he was not pert, nor made difficulties; nor was he too bold,\r\n(as if about) to sing a mass for a fool.' The last expression was probably\r\nproverbial; it seems to mean to speak without hesitation or a feeling of\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n115. _to watre wolde_, would turn to water; cf. Squi. Ta. F 496.\r\n\r\n120. '_I? what?_' i. e. 'I? what (am I to do)?' In l. 122, Pandarus repeats\r\nher words, mockingly: 'You say I? what? why, of course you should pity\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n136-138. 'And I (am) to have comfort, as it pleases you, (being at the same\r\ntime) under your correction, (so as to have what is) equal to my offence,\r\nas (for instance) death.' See Cant. Ta. B 1287.\r\n\r\n150. 'By the feast of Jupiter, who presides over nativities.' The reason\r\nfor the use of _natal_ is not obvious. Cf. 'Scit Genius, natale comes qui\r\ntemperat astrum;' Horat. Ep. ii. 2. 187.\r\n\r\n188. 'I seem to hear the town-bells ringing for this miracle, though no\r\nhand pulls the ropes.'\r\n\r\n193, 194. _and oon, And two_, 'both the one of you and the other.'\r\n\r\n198. _bere the belle_, take the former place, take precedence; like the\r\nbell-wether that heads the flock. See the New E. Dict.\r\n\r\n228. 'Straight as a line,' i. e. directly, at once.\r\n\r\n294. See Manc. Ta. H 333, and note.\r\n\r\n299. 'Thou understandest and knowest enough proverbs against the vice of\r\ngossiping, even if men spoke truth as often as they lie.'\r\n\r\n308. 'No boaster is to be believed, in the natural course of things.'\r\n\r\n328, 329. _drat_, dreadeth. Cf. 'Felix, quem faciunt aliena pericula\r\ncautum.' But Chaucer took it from Le Rom. de la Rose, 8041-2: 'Moult a\r\nbenéurée vie Cil qui par autrui se chastie.'\r\n\r\n340. 'And a day is appointed for making up the charters' (which will\r\nparticularise what she has granted you); metaphorical.\r\n\r\n349. _richesse_, abundance; not a happy word, but suggested by the Ital.\r\ntext: 'I sospir ch'egli aveva a gran dovizia;' Fil. iii. 11. _Dovizia_\r\n(Lat. _diuitiae_) is precisely 'richesse.' Bell has _rehetyng_, i. e.\r\ncomforting (from O. F. _rehaiter_, _reheiter_), which gives no sense; and\r\nexplains it by '_reheating_!'\r\n\r\n354. _lusty_, lusty person; cf. Cant. Ta. A 165, 208.\r\n\r\n377. 'Or durst (do so), or should know (how).'\r\n\r\n380. _stokked_, fastened in the stocks; cf. Acts xvi. 24.\r\n\r\n404. _Departe it so_, make this distinction.\r\n\r\n410. _frape_, company, troop. Marked by Tyrwhitt as not understood. Other\r\nexamples occur. 'With hem a god gret _frape_;' Adam Davy, &c., ed.\r\nFurnivall, p. 60, col. 1, text 3, l. 390; and see Allit. Morte Arthure, ed.\r\nBrock, 2163, 2804, 3548. Godefroy gives O. F. _frap_, a multitude, and\r\n_frapaille_, rabble.\r\n\r\n445. 'And wished to be seised of that which he lacked.'\r\n\r\n497. 'Or to enumerate all the looks and words of one that is in such\r\nuncertainty.'\r\n\r\n502. _as seith_; but it does not appear that Boccaccio says anything of the\r\nkind. The same remark applies to l. 575.\r\n\r\n510. _Fulfelle_ is a Kentish form, the _e_ answering to A. S. _y_. Similar\r\nforms occur in Gower. See note to Book Duch. 438.\r\n\r\n526. Scan: Dréd | elées | it cleer,' &c. The sense is: 'it was clear, in\r\nthe direction of the wind, from every magpie and every spoil-sport.' I. e.\r\nno one could detect them; they kept (like hunters) well to leeward, and\r\nthere were no magpies or telltale birds to windward, to give an alarm.\r\n\r\n529. Scan: In this matér-e, both-e frem'd. _fremed_, strange, wild.\r\n\r\n542. _holy_, i. e. sacred to Apollo. From Ovid, Met. i. 566: 'laurea ..\r\nuisa est agitasse cacumen.'\r\n\r\n545. 'And therefore let no one hinder him.'\r\n\r\n572. The readings all shew various corruptions of _thurfte_, which none of\r\nthe scribes understood; see _thurfen_, _tharf_, in Stratmann. This is not\r\nthe only place where _thurfte_ has been ousted from the text. Cf. _thar_\r\n(for _tharf_) in the Reves Ta. A 4320, &c. _Yow thurfte have_, you would\r\nneed (to) have. _Yow_ is the dat. case, governed by the impers. verb. The\r\nreading _yow durste_ turns _yow_ (an accusative) into an imaginary\r\nnominative; but the nom. form is _ye_, which the scribes did not venture to\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\n584. _goosish_, goose-like, silly. This delicious epithet was turned into\r\n_gofysshe_ by Thynne, and modern editions perpetuate the blunder. Tyrwhitt\r\nderived _gofish_ from F. _goffe_, a word which is much later than Chaucer,\r\nand was probably merely adapted from Ital. _goffo_, stupid. The Century\r\nDict. goes a step further, inserting a second _f_, and producing a form\r\n_goffish_, against all authority. Cf. Parl. Foules, 568, 586.\r\n\r\n601. _stewe_, small chamber, closet; cf. G. _Stube_.\r\n\r\n602. 'Where he was shut in, as in a coop.'\r\n\r\n609. 'There was no dainty to be fetched'; they were all there.\r\n\r\n614. _Wade_; this is the hero mentioned in the Merch. Tale, E 1424; see\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n617-620. Cf. Boethius, Bk. iv. Pr. 6. 60-68.\r\n\r\n622. 'Without her leave, at the will of the gods.'\r\n\r\n624. _bente_, i. e. curved, crescent; see l. 549. Cf. Boeth. Bk. I. Met. 5.\r\n6, 7.\r\n\r\n625. The Moon, Saturn, and Jupiter were all in conjunction in Cancer, which\r\nwas the mansion of the moon. We are to understand that this caused the\r\ngreat rain.\r\n\r\n640. _ron_, rained; so also in l. 677. The usual pt. t. is _reinede_, but\r\nwe also find _roon_, _ron_, as in P. Plowm. B. xiv. 66 (C. xvi. 270), and\r\nin Trevisa, tr. of Higden, ii. 239. The pt. t. of A. S. _rignan_,\r\n_r[=i]nan_, is usually _r[=i]nde_; but the strong pt. _r[=a]n_ occurs in\r\nthe Blickling Glosses.\r\n\r\n648. _a game_, in game; _a_ = _an_, _on_; Cm. has _on_.\r\n\r\n671. _The wyn anon_, the wine (shall come) at once; alluding to the wine\r\ndrunk just before going to bed. See Prol. A 819, 820.\r\n\r\n674. 'The _voidè_ being drunk, and the cross-curtain drawn immediately\r\nafterwards.' The best reading is _voyde_ or _voydee_. This seems to be here\r\nused as a name for the 'loving-cup' or 'grace-cup,' which was drunk after\r\nthe table had been cleared or _voided_. Properly, it was a slight dessert\r\nof 'spices' and wine; where _spices_ meant sweetmeats, dried fruits, &c.\r\nSee Notes and Queries, 2 S. xi. 508. The _traverse_ was a screen or curtain\r\ndrawn across the room; cf. Cant. Ta. E 1817; King's Quair, st. 90. See\r\nAdditional Note, p. 506.\r\n\r\n690. This refers to the attendants. They were no longer allowed to skip\r\nabout (run on errands) or to tramp about noisily, but were packed off to\r\nbed, with a malediction on those who stirred about. _Traunceth_, tramps\r\nabout, is used of a bull by Gower, C. A. ii. 72. In Beaumont and Fletcher,\r\nFair Maid of the Inn, v. 2, we find--'but, _traunce_ the world over, you\r\nshall never,' &c. For _traunce_, Thynne reads _praunce_, which has a\r\nsimilar sense. Morris explains _traunce_ here as a sb., which seems\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n695. _The olde daunce_, the old game; see Prol. A 476.\r\n\r\n696. _sey_, saw; perhaps read _seye_, subj., might perceive. If so, read\r\n_al_, i. e. every.\r\n\r\n702. 'Beginning and end;' see note to bk. II. 1495.\r\n\r\n711. I. e. or else upset everything; cf. the phrase, 'all the fat is in the\r\nfire.'\r\n\r\n716. Mars and Saturn both had an evil influence.\r\n\r\n717. _combust_, quenched, viz. by being too near the sun; see Astrolabe,\r\npt. ii. § 4. Venus and Mercury, when thus 'combust,' lost their influence.\r\n_let_, hindered.\r\n\r\n721. _Adoon_, Adonis; see Ovid, Met. x. 715.\r\n\r\n722. _Europe_, Europa; see Leg. of Good Women, 113, and note.\r\n\r\n725. _Cipris_, Venus; see Ho. Fame, 518.\r\n\r\n726. _Dane_, Daphne; see Kn. Ta. A 2062.\r\n\r\n729. _Mercúrie_, Mercury; _Herse_, daughter of Cecrops, beloved by Mercury.\r\nHer sister, Aglauros, had displeased Minerva (_Pallas_); whereupon Minerva\r\nmade Aglauros envious of Herse. Mercury turned Aglauros into stone because\r\nshe hindered his suit. See Ovid, Met. ii. 708-832.\r\n\r\n733. 'Fatal sisters;' i.e. the Fates, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. 'Which\r\nspun my destiny, before any cloth (infant's covering) was made for me.' See\r\nKn. Ta. A 1566; Leg. G. Wom. 2629.\r\n\r\n764. Let sleeping dogs lie; a proverb.\r\n\r\n773. 'To hold in hand' is to feed with false hopes, to delude by pretended\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n775. Lit. 'and make him a hood above a cap.' A _calle_ (caul) was a\r\nclose-fitting cap, a skull-cap. To put on a hood over this evidently means\r\nto cover up the eyes, to cajole, to hoodwink.\r\n\r\n791, 797. _shal_, owe to. _sholde love_, i.e. are reported to love.\r\n\r\n813-836. Founded on Boethius, lib. II. Pr. 4. 'Quàm multis amaritudinibus\r\nhumanae felicitatis dulcedo respersa est!... Anxia enim res est humanorum\r\nconditio bonorum, et quae uel numquam tota proueniat, uel numquam perpetua\r\nsubsistat.... Ad haec, quem caduca ista felicitas uehit, uel scit eam, uel\r\nnescit esse mutabilem. Si nescit, quaenam beata sors esse potest\r\nignorantiae caecitate? Si scit, metuat necesse est, ne amittat, quod amitti\r\npotest non dubitat; quare continuus timor non sinit esse felicem.... quonam\r\nmodo praesens uita facere beatos potest?' See the E. version, ll. 86, 56,\r\n109.\r\n\r\n839. 'Why hast thou made Troilus distrust me?'\r\n\r\n853, 854. 'Danger is drawn nearer by delay.' We say, 'Delays are\r\ndangerous.' Cf. Havelok, l. 1352. _abodes_, abidings, tarryings.\r\n\r\n855. _Néc'_, with elided _e_, forms the first foot. 'Every thing has its\r\ntime;' cf. Eccl. iii. 1.\r\n\r\n861. _farewel feldefare_, (and people will say) farewell, fieldfare! Cf.\r\nRom. Rose, 5510. In the Rom. Rose, it refers to false friends, who, when\r\nfortune frowns, say 'Go! farewell fieldfare,' i.e. Begone, we have done\r\nwith you. As fieldfares come here in the winter months, people are glad to\r\nsee them go, as a sign of approaching summer. In the present case, the\r\nsense appears to be that, when an opportunity is missed, the harm is done;\r\nand people will cry, 'farewell, fieldfare!' by way of derision. We might\r\nparaphrase the line by saying: 'the harm is done, and nobody cares.'\r\n\r\n885. _blewe_, blue; the colour of _constancy_.\r\n\r\n890. 'Hazle-bushes shake.' This is a truism known to every one, and no news\r\nat all; in like manner, your ring will tell him nothing, and is useless.\r\n\r\n901. _feffe him_, enfeoff him, bestow on him. _whyte_, fair.\r\n\r\n919. _at pryme face_, at the first glance; _primâ facie_.\r\n\r\n931. _At dulcarnon_, at a non-plus, in extreme perplexity. _Dulcarnon_, as\r\npointed out by Selden, in his Pref. to Drayton's Polyolbion, represents the\r\nPers. and Arab. _d[=u]'lkarnayn_, lit. two-horned; from Pers. _d[=u]_, two,\r\nand _karn_, horn. It was a common medieval epithet of Alexander the Great,\r\nwho was so called because he claimed descent from Jupiter Ammon, whose\r\nimage was provided with horns like a ram. Speght rightly says that\r\n_Dulcarnon_ was also a name for the 47th prop. of Euclid, Book I, but gives\r\na false reason and etymology. The real reason is plain enough, viz. that\r\nthe two smaller squares in the diagram stick up like two horns. And, as\r\nthis proposition is somewhat difficult for beginners, it here takes the\r\nsense of 'puzzle;' hence Criseyde was _at Dulcarnon_, because she was in\r\nperplexity. Speght refers to Alex. Neckam, De Naturis Rerum; see Wright's\r\nedition, p. 295.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. In l. 933, Pandarus explains that Dulcarnon is called\r\n'fleming of wrecches.' There is a slight error here: 'fleming of wrecches,'\r\ni.e. banishment of the miserable, is a translation of _Fuga miserorum_,\r\nwhich is written opposite this line in MS. Harl. 1239; and further, _Fuga\r\nmiserorum_ is a sort of Latin translation of _Eleëfuga_ or _Eleufuga_, from\r\n[Greek: eleos] pity, and [Greek: phygê], flight. The error lies in\r\nconfusing _Dulcarnon_, the 47th proposition, with _Eleufuga_, a name for\r\nthe 5th proposition; a confusion due to the fact that both propositions\r\nwere considered difficult. Roger Bacon, Opus Tertium, cap. 6, says: 'Quinta\r\npropositio geometricae Euclidis dicitur _Elefuga_, id est, _fuga\r\nmiserorum_.' Ducange, s. v. _Eleufuga_, quotes from Alanus, Anticlaudiani\r\nlib. iii. cap. 6--'Huius tirones curantis [_read_ cur artis] _Eleufuga_\r\nterret,' &c. The word also occurs in Richard of Bury's Philobiblon, cap.\r\nxiii, somewhat oddly translated by J.B. Inglis in 1832. 'How many scholars\r\nhas the Helleflight of Euclid repelled!'\r\n\r\nThis explanation, partly due to the Rev. W.G. Clark (joint-editor of the\r\nGlobe Shakespeare), was first given in the _Athenæum_, Sept. 23, 1871, p.\r\n393, in an article written by myself.\r\n\r\n934. _It_, i.e. _Dulcarnon_, or Euclid's proposition. 'It seems hard,\r\nbecause the wretched pupils will not learn it, owing to their very sloth or\r\nother wilful defects.'\r\n\r\n936. _This_ = _this is_; as elsewhere. _fecches_, vetches.\r\n\r\n947. Understand _be_; 'where (I hope) good thrift may be.' Cf. 966.\r\n\r\n978. _fere_, fire; as in Bk. i. 229. Usually _fyre_.\r\n\r\n979. _fond his contenaunce_, lit. found his demeanour, i.e. composed\r\nhimself as if to read.\r\n\r\n1010. _wivere_, viper; O. F. _wivre_ (F. _givre_), from Lat. _uipera_. The\r\nheraldic _wiver_ or _wyvern_ became a wondrous winged dragon, with two\r\nlegs; wholly unlike the original viper. See Thynne's Animadversions, &c.,\r\ned. Furnivall, p. 41.\r\n\r\n1013. 'Alas! that he, either entirely, or a slice of him.'\r\n\r\n1021. 'That sufferest undeserved jealousy (to exist).'\r\n\r\n1029. _after that_, accordingly; _his_, its.\r\n\r\n1035. See note to Bk. ii. 784.\r\n\r\n1046. _ordal_, ordeal, trial by ordeal, i.e. by fire or water. See Thynne's\r\nAnimadversions, ed. Furnivall, p. 66.\r\n\r\n1056. _wreigh_, covered; A. S. _wr[=a]h_; see _wr[=i]hen_ in Stratmann.\r\n\r\n1064. _shoures_, assaults. Bell actually substitutes _stouris_, as being\r\n'clearly the true reading.' But editors have no right to reject real words\r\nwhich they fail to understand. _Shour_ sometimes means a shower of arrows\r\nor darts, an assault, &c.; cf. A.S. _hildesc[=u]r_, a flight of missiles.\r\nIn fact, it recurs in this sense in Bk. iv. 47, where Bell again turns it\r\ninto _stoure_, against authority.\r\n\r\n1067. 'For it seemed to him not like (mere) strokes with a rod ... but he\r\nfelt the very cramp of death.'\r\n\r\n1106. _al forgeve_, all is forgiven. _stint_, stopped.\r\n\r\n1154. _bar him on honde_, assured him.\r\n\r\n1177. 'For a crime, there is mercy (to be had).'\r\n\r\n1194. _sucre be or soot_, may be like sugar or like soot, i.e. pleasant or\r\nthe reverse. We must read _soot_ (not _sote_, sweet, as in Bell) because it\r\nrimes with _moot_. Moreover, soot was once proverbially bitter. 'Bittrore\r\nthen the sote' occurs in Altenglische Dichtungen, ed. Boddeker, p. 121; and\r\nin Rutebuef's Vie Sainte Marie l'Egiptianne, ed. Jubinal, 280, we find\r\n'plus amer que suie;' cf. Rom. Rose, 10670: 'amer Plus que n'est suie.'\r\n\r\n1215. Cf. 'Bitter pills may have sweet effects;' Hazlitt's Proverbs.\r\n\r\n1231. _Bitrent_, for _bitrendeth_, winds round; cf. iv. 870. _wryth_, for\r\n_wrytheth_, writhes.\r\n\r\n1235. 'When she hears any shepherd speak.'\r\n\r\n1249. 'And often invoked good luck upon her snowy throat.'\r\n\r\n1257. _welwilly_, full of good will, propitious.\r\n\r\n1258. _Imeneus_, Hymenæus, Hymen; cf. Ovid, Her. xiv. 27.\r\n\r\n1261-4. Imitated from Dante, Parad. xxxiii. 14:--\r\n\r\n 'Che qual vuol grazie, e a te non ricorre,\r\n  Sua disianza vuol volar senz' ali.\r\n  La tua benignità non pur soccorre,' &c.\r\n\r\n1282. 'Mercy prevails over (lit. surpasses) justice.'\r\n\r\n1344. 'Or else do I dream it?'\r\n\r\n1357. _sooth_, for _sooth is_, i.e. it is true.\r\n\r\n1369. Bell takes _scripture_ to mean the mottos or posies on the rings.\r\nPerhaps this is right.\r\n\r\n1374. _holt_, holds; 'that holds it in despite.'\r\n\r\n1375. 'Of the money, that he can heap up and lay hold of.' For _mokren_,\r\ncf. Chaucer's Boethius, Bk. ii. Pr. 5. 11. _Pens_, pence, is a translation\r\nof Ital. _denari_, money, in the Filostrato, Book iii. st. 38.\r\n\r\n1384. _the whyte_, silver coins; _the rede_, gold coins.\r\n\r\n1389. _Myda_, Midas; see Wyf of Bathes Tale, D 951.\r\n\r\n1391. _Crassus_; wantonly altered to _Cresus_ in Bell's edition, on the\r\nground that the story is told of Croesus. But Chaucer knew better. M.\r\nCrassus, surnamed Dives (the Rich), was slain in battle against the\r\nParthians, B. C. 53. Orodes, king of Parthia, caused molten gold to be\r\npoured into the mouth of his dead enemy, saying, 'Sate thyself now with\r\nthat metal of which, in life, thou wast so greedy;' Cicero, Att. vi. 1. 14;\r\nFlorus, iii. 11. 4.\r\n\r\n1407. 'And to counterbalance with joy their former woe'.\r\n\r\n1415. The cock is called a common astrologer (i. e. astronomer), because he\r\nannounces to all the time of day; cf. Non. Pr. Ta. B 4043; Parl. Foules,\r\n350. Translated from 'vulgaris astrologus;' Alanus.\r\n\r\n1417, 9. _Lucifer_, the morning-star, the planet Venus. _Fortuna maior_,\r\nthe planet Jupiter. Mars and Saturn were supposed to have an _evil_\r\ninfluence; the Sun, Mercury, and Moon, had no great influence either way;\r\nwhilst Jupiter and Venus had a _good_ influence, and were therefore called,\r\nrespectively, _Fortuna maior_ and _Fortuna minor_. See G. Douglas, ed.\r\nSmall, ii. 288. The MSS. have _that anoon_, (it happened) that anon; but\r\nthis requires us to suppose so awkward an ellipsis that it is better to\r\nread _than_, answering to _whan_.\r\n\r\n1428. _Almena_, Alcmena; a note in MS. H. has: 'Almena mater Herculis.'\r\nAlcmena was the mother of Hercules by Jupiter. Jupiter lengthened the night\r\nbeyond its usual limit. Plautus has a play on the subject, called\r\n_Amphitruo_, as Jupiter personated Amphitryon.\r\n\r\n1437-9. _ther_, wherefore; 'wherefore (I pray that) God, creator of nature,\r\nmay bind thee so fast to our hemisphere,' &c. A similar construction occurs\r\nin l. 1456.\r\n\r\n1453. _bore_, aperture, chink; 'for every chink lets in one of thy bright\r\nrays.' See New E. Dict.\r\n\r\n1462. Engravers of small seals require a good light.\r\n\r\n1464. _Tytan_, Titan, frequently used as synonymous with the sun; as in\r\nOvid, Met. i. 10. Chaucer has confused him with _Tithonus_, the husband of\r\nAurora, whom he denotes by _dawing_ in l. 1466, and by _morwe_ in l. 1469.\r\n\r\n 'Iamque, fugatura Tithoni coniuge noctem,\r\n    Praeuius Aurorae Lucifer ortus erat.'\r\n                             Ovid, Heroid. xviii. 111.\r\n\r\n1490. Read _wer-e_, in two syllables. _these worldes tweyne_ seems to mean\r\n'two worlds such as this.'\r\n\r\n1495. This somewhat resembles Verg. Ecl. i. 60-4.\r\n\r\n1502. 'Even if I had to die by torture;' as in Bk. i. 674.\r\n\r\n1514. _mo_, others; see note to Cler. Ta. E 1039.\r\n\r\n1546. 'Desire burnt him afresh, and pleasure began to arise more than at\r\nfirst.' Cf. the parallel line in Leg. Good Wom. 1156: 'Of which ther gan to\r\nbreden swich a fyr.' Yet Bell rejects this reading as being 'not at all in\r\nChaucer's manner,' and prefers nonsense.\r\n\r\n1577. 'Christ forgave those who crucified him.'\r\n\r\n1600. Cf. Æneid. vi. 550:--\r\n\r\n 'Quae rapidus flammis ambit torrentibus amnis\r\n  Tartareus Phlegethon.'\r\n\r\n1625. From Boethius, lib. ii. Pr. 4: 'Sed hoc est, quod recolentem\r\nuehementius coquit. Nam in omni aduersitate fortunae infelicissimum genus\r\nest infortunii, fuisse felicem.' Cf. Dante, Inf. v. 121; Tennyson, Locksley\r\nHall--'That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.'\r\n\r\n1634. Cf. Rom. de la Rose, 8301-4; from Ovid, Art. Amat. ii. 13.\r\n\r\n1642. _Ne I_, read _N'I_. _rakle_, behave rashly; it is plainly a _verb_,\r\nformed from the adj. _rakel_. Morris inserts _ben_ after _rakel_, to the\r\nruin of the scansion. Cf. Norweg. _rakla_, to ramble, totter, be unsteady\r\n(Aasen); Swed. dial. _rakkla_, to rove (Rietz); Icel. _reka_, to drive.\r\n\r\n1649. _I shal_, I owe; A. S. _ic sceal_.\r\n\r\n1687. _comprende_, comprehend; F. _comprendre_. This is clearly the right\r\nform. In the Sq. Ta. F 223, though the MSS. have _comprehende_, it is\r\nobvious that _comprende_ is the real reading.\r\n\r\n1703. _Pirous_, i. e. Pyroeis, one of the four horses that drew the chariot\r\nof the sun. The other three were Eöus, Æthon, and Phlegon; see Ovid, Met.\r\nii. 153.\r\n\r\n1705. 'Have taken some short cut, to spite me.'\r\n\r\n1732. 'To the extent of a single knot.' It would not be necessary to\r\nexplain this, if it were not for Bell's explanation of _knot_ as 'gnat.'\r\n\r\n1734. _y-masked_, enmeshed; cf. A. S. _masc_, a mesh.\r\n\r\n1744-68. Paraphrased from Boethius, lib. ii. Met. 8; but note that the\r\nlines italicised are transposed, and represent ll. 1744-1750:\r\n\r\n 'Quòd mundus stabili fide Concordes uariat uices,\r\n  Quòd pugnantia semina Foedus perpetuum tenent,\r\n  Quòd Phoebus roseum diem Curru prouehit aureo,\r\n  Ut quas duxerit Hesperus Phoebe noctibus imperet,\r\n  Ut fluctus auidum mare Certo fine coërceat,\r\n  Ne terris liceat uagis Latos tendere terminos.\r\n  _Hanc rerum seriem ligat, Terras ac pelagus regens,\r\n  Et caelo imperitans Amor._ Hic si fraena remiserit,\r\n  Quidquid nunc amat inuicem, Bellum continuò geret:\r\n  Et quam nunc socia fide Pulcris motibus incitant,\r\n  Certent soluere machinam. Hic sancto populos quoque\r\n  Iunctos foedere continet: Hic et coniugii sacrum\r\n  Castis nectit amoribus: Hic fidis etiam sua\r\n  Dictat iura sodalibus. O felix hominum genus,\r\n  Si uestros animos Amor Quo caelum regitur, regat!'\r\n\r\n1764. _halt to-hepe_, holds together, preserves in concord. Bell and Morris\r\nhave the corrupt reading _to kepe_. _To hepe_, to a heap, became the adv.\r\n_to-hepe_, together. It occurs again in Ch. Astrolabe, Part I. § 14, and in\r\nBoethius, Bk. iv. Pr. 6. 182. Cf. 'gaderen tresor _to-hepe_,' Polit. Songs,\r\ned. Wright, p. 325; 'han brought it _to-hepe_,' P. Ploughman's Crede, l.\r\n727.\r\n\r\n1766. 'That Love, by means of his power, would be pleased,' &c.\r\n\r\n1779. _In tyme of trewe_, in time of truce; as in Boccaccio, Fil. iii. st.\r\n91. Bell wrongly has _Out of Troy_. Morris alters _trewe_ to _trewes_; but\r\nsee Bk. iv. l. 1312.\r\n\r\n1805. These are four of the seven deadly sins; see Pers. Tale.\r\n\r\n1807. _lady_, i. e. Venus, called _Dionaea_ as being daughter of Dione;\r\nÆneid. iii. 19. Cf. Homer, Il. v. 370.\r\n\r\n1809. The nine Muses. Helicon was a long way from Mount Parnassus; but see\r\nnotes to Anelida, 15, and Ho. Fame, 521.\r\n\r\n1817. 'As it pleases my author to relate.'\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nThe following scheme gives some notion of the relationship of the contents\r\nof this book to the Filostrato, but Chaucer constantly expands and adds to\r\nthe original, and not unfrequently transposes the order of the text.\r\n\r\n  TROILUS: BOOK IV.

In the Proem, ll. 1-3 correspond to Fil. iii. st. 94, ll. 1-3; and ll. 8\r\nand 10 to the same stanza, ll. 4 and 7. The rest is original.\r\n\r\n3. Cf. Boethius, lib. ii. Pr. 1: 'Intelligo ... illius [Fortunae] ... cum\r\nhis, quos eludere nititur, blandissimam familiaritatem.'\r\n\r\n5. _hent and blent_, for _hendeth and blendeth_, catches and blinds.\r\n\r\n6, 7. Cf. Boethius, lib. ii. Met. 2: 'Ultroque gemitus, dura quos fecit\r\n[Fortuna], ridet.' Whence, in Le Roman de la Rose, 8076-9, the passage\r\nwhich Chaucer here imitates; _the mowe_ = F. _la moe_.\r\n\r\n22. _Herines_ i. e. Furies; used as the pl. of _Erynis_ or _Erinnys_; see\r\nnote to Compl. to Pite, 92. Their names (see l. 24) were Megaera, Alecto,\r\nand Tisiphone. Bell's remark, that Chaucer found these names in Boccaccio,\r\ndoes not seem to be founded on fact. He more likely found them in Vergil,\r\nwho has _Erinnys_, Æn. ii. 336, 573; vii. 447, 570; _Alecto_, id. vii. 324,\r\n341, 405, 415, 445, 476; _Megæra_, id. xii. 846; _Tisiphone_, vi. 571, x.\r\n761. But I suppose that, even in Chaucer's time, MS. note-books existed,\r\ncontaining such information as the names of the Furies. Chaucer even knew\r\nthat some (as Æschylus) considered them to be the daughters of Night.\r\n\r\n25. _Quiryne_, Quirinus. Ovid, Fasti, ii. 476, tells us that Quirinus was\r\nRomulus; and just above, ii. 419, that Romulus and Remus were sons of Mars.\r\n\r\n29. _Ligginge ... The Grekes_, while the Greeks lay.\r\n\r\n32. _Hercules Lyoun_, Hercules' lion, the lion of Hercules; alluding to the\r\nlion's skin which Hercules wore. Valerius Flaccus, Argonauticon, lib. i.\r\n263, has 'Herculeo ... leoni;' and Chaucer seems to have read this author,\r\nor at any rate his first book; see Leg. of Good Women, l. 1457, and the\r\nnote. However, Chaucer shews his knowledge of the story clearly enough in\r\nhis tr. of Boethius, Bk. iv. Met. 7. The reference is, simply, to the sign\r\nLeo. The sun was in this sign during the latter part of July and the former\r\npart of August; but we are further told that he was in the 'breast' of Leo,\r\nand therefore near the very bright star Regulus, called in Arabic\r\n_Kalbalased_, or the Lion's Heart, which was situated almost on the zodiac,\r\nand (at that time) near the 20th degree of the sign. This gives the date as\r\nbeing the first week in August.\r\n\r\n41. _in the berd_, in the beard, i. e. face to face.\r\n\r\n47. _shour_, assault, attack; see note to Bk. iii. 1064.\r\n\r\n50-4. From Boccaccio. The right names are Antenor, Polydamas, Menestheus or\r\nMnestheus, Xanthippus, Sarpedon, Polymnestor, Polites, Riphaeus, all\r\nmentioned by Boccaccio, who probably took them from Guido delle Colonne.\r\nBut Boccaccio omits 'Phebuseo,' and I do not know who is meant. Several of\r\nthese names may be found in the allit. Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and\r\nDonaldson; as Antenor and his son Polydamas, at ll. 3947, 3954; Xanthippus,\r\nking of Phrygia, l. 6107; Sarpedon, prince of Lycia, l. 5448; and in\r\nLydgate's Siege of Troy, Bk. ii. capp. 16, 20. Polymestor, or Polymnestor,\r\nwas king of the Thracian Chersonese, and an ally of the Trojans. Polites\r\nwas a son of Priam (Æneid. ii. 526). Mnestheus is repeatedly mentioned in\r\nVergil (Æn. v. 116, &c.), and is also called Menestheus (id. x. 129); he is\r\na different person from Menestheus, king of Athens, who fought on the other\r\nside. For Riphaeus, see Verg. Aen. ii. 339. The Ital. forms are Antenorre,\r\nPolidamas, Monesteo, Santippo, Serpedon, Polinestorre, Polite, Rifeo.\r\nObserve that Monostéo, Riphéo, Phebuséo rime together, with an accent on\r\nthe penultimate.\r\n\r\n62. _thassege_, for _the assege_, the siege; Barbour has _assege_, siege,\r\nin his Bruce, xvii. 270, xx. 8; pl. _assegis_, xx. 12. MS. H. wrongly has\r\n_thessage_. See l. 1480 below.\r\n\r\n64. _Calkas_, Calchas; see Bk. i. 66, 71.\r\n\r\n79. _This town to shende_, i. e. (it will be best for you) to despoil this\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n86. _resport_, regard. This strange word is certified by its reappearance\r\nin l. 850, where it rimes to _discomfórt_. It is given in Roquefort, but\r\nonly in a technical sense. It was, doubtless, formed from O. F. _esport_,\r\ndeportment, demeanour, regard (Godefroy), by prefixing _re-_; and means\r\n'demeanour towards,' or (here) simply 'regard,' as also in l. 850. The\r\netymology is from Lat. _re-_, _ex_, and _portare_. Cf. F. _rapport_, from\r\n_re-_, _ad_, and _portare_.\r\n\r\n96. _in hir sherte_, in her smock only; i.e. without much rich clothing;\r\n'as she was.'\r\n\r\n99. 'For because I saw no opportunity.'\r\n\r\n112. _as yerne_, as briskly as possible, very soon; so in l. 201.\r\n\r\n120-4. Laomedon, father of Priam, founded Troy. Apollo and Poseidon\r\n(Neptune) had been condemned for a while to serve him for wages. But\r\nLaomedon refused them payment, and incurred their displeasure.\r\n\r\n133. Antenor had been taken prisoner by the Greeks; see Lydgate, Siege of\r\nTroye, Bk. iii. ch. 24. Lydgate's version is that Antenor was to be\r\nexchanged for Thoas, king of Calydon; and, at the request of Chalcas, it\r\nwas arranged that Antenor should be exchanged for both Thoas and Criseyde\r\n(see l. 138); to which Priam consented.\r\n\r\n_withoute more_, without further ado; cf. l. 376.\r\n\r\n143. _parlement_; here Boccaccio has _parlamento_, i.e. a parley. Chaucer\r\ngives it the English sense.\r\n\r\n168. 'The love of you both, where it was before unknown.'\r\n\r\n197. From Juvenal, Sat. x. ll. 2-4:--\r\n\r\n               'pauci dignoscere possunt\r\n  Vera bona atque illis multum diuersa, remota\r\n  Erroris nebula.'\r\n\r\nCf. Dryden's translation and Dr. Johnson's poem on the Vanity of Human\r\nWishes.\r\n\r\n198, 9. _what is to yerne_, what is desirable. _offence_, disappointment.\r\n\r\n203. _mischaunce_; because Antenor contrived the removal from Troy of the\r\nPalladium, on which the safety of the city depended. Cf. Lydgate, Siege of\r\nTroye, Bk. iv. ch. 34; or the account by Caxton, quoted in Specimens of\r\nEnglish from 1394-1579, ed. Skeat, p. 89.\r\n\r\n210. _here and howne._ The sense of this phrase is not known; but, judging\r\nby the context, it seems to mean--'thus said every one, such was the common\r\nrumour.' It has been explained as 'thus said _hare_ and _hound_,' i.e.\r\npeople of all sorts; but the M. E. form of _hare_ is _hare_ (A. S. _hara_),\r\nand the M. E. form of 'hound' never appears as _howne_, which, by the way,\r\nis evidently dissyllabic. In the absence of further evidence, guesswork is\r\nhardly profitable; but I should like to suggest that the phrase may mean\r\n'gentle and savage.' The M. E. _here_, gentle, occurs in Layamon, 25867;\r\nand in Amis and Amiloun, 16 (Stratmann); from A. S. _h[=e]ore_. _Houne_\r\nanswers, phonetically, to an A. S. _H[=u]na_, which may mean a Hun, a\r\nsavage; cf. Ger. _Hüne_.\r\n\r\n225. From Dante, Inf. iii. 112:--\r\n\r\n 'Come d'autunno si levan le foglie\r\n  L'una appresso dell' altra infin che 'l ramo\r\n  Rende alla terra tutte le sue spoglie.'\r\n\r\n239. This stanza follows Boccaccio closely; but Boccaccio, in his turn,\r\nhere imitates a passage in Dante, Inf. xii. 22:--\r\n\r\n 'Qual è quel toro che si slaccia in quella\r\n  C'ha ricevuto già 'l colpo mortale,\r\n  Che gir non sa, ma qua e là saltella.'\r\n\r\n251, 2. Almost repeated in the Clerk Ta. E 902, 3; see note to the latter\r\nline, and cf. Gower, Conf. Amant. ii. 14--'Right as a lives creature She\r\nsemeth,' &c.\r\n\r\n263. In MS. H., _thus_ is glossed by 'sine causa.'\r\n\r\n272. Accent _misérie_ on _e_; 'Nella miseria;' Inf. v. 123.\r\n\r\n279. _combre-world_, encumbrance of the world, a compound epithet. It is\r\nused by Hoccleve, in his lament for Chaucer, De Regim. Principum, st. 299.\r\n'A _cumber-world_, yet in the world am left;' Drayton, Pastorals, Ecl. ii.\r\n25.\r\n\r\n286. _gerful_, changeable; see note to Kn. Ta. A 1536.\r\n\r\n300. _Edippe_, Oedipus, king of Thebes, who put out his own eyes on finding\r\nthat he had slain his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta; Statius,\r\nTheb. i. 46.\r\n\r\n302. Rossetti thus translates Fil. iv. st. 34: 'O soul, wretched and\r\nastray, Why fliest thou not out of the most ill-fortuned body that lives? O\r\nsoul brought low, part from the body, and follow Chryseis.'\r\n\r\n305. _unneste_, glossed in H. by 'go out of thi nest;' correctly.\r\n\r\n318. Read _my_, not _the_ or _thy_; Rossetti thus translates Fil. iv. st.\r\n36: 'O my Chryseis, O sweet bliss of the sorrowing soul which calls on\r\nthee! Who will any more give comfort to _my_ pains?'\r\n\r\n330. _unholsom_; Boccaccio has _insano_, Fil. iv. st. 38. 'I think it\r\npretty clear that B. means _insane_ in our ordinary sense for that word;\r\nbut Chaucer's _unholsom_ is no doubt founded on B.'s epithet, and is highly\r\npicturesque.'--Rossetti.\r\n\r\n356, 7. Nearly repeated in Man of Lawes Ta. B 608, 9. See l. 882.\r\n\r\n381. 'As certainly do I wish it were false, as I know it is true.'\r\n\r\n392. _propretee_, his own indefeasible possession; see Boethius, Bk. ii.\r\nPr. 2. 9 (p. 27), 61 (p. 28).\r\n\r\n407. Pandarus took his morality from Ovid; cf. Amorum lib. ii. 4. 10-44:\r\n'Centum sunt causae, cur ego semper amem;' &c.\r\n\r\n413. _heroner_, a large falcon for herons; _faucon for rivere_, a goshawk\r\nfor waterfowl. See note to Sir Thopas, B 1927.\r\n\r\n414, 5. From Boccaccio, who does not, however, give the name of the author\r\nof the saying. The remark 'as Zanzis writeth' is Chaucer's own. It is quite\r\nclear that _Zanzis_ in this passage is the same as the _Zanzis_ in the\r\nPhysiciens Tale, C 16; and he is no other than Zeuxis the painter. I do not\r\nsuppose that Chaucer had any special reason for assigning to him the\r\nsaying, but his name was as useful as that of any one else, and the\r\nmedieval method of reference is frequently so casual and light-hearted that\r\nthere is nothing to wonder at. Besides, we are distinctly told (l. 428)\r\nthat Pandarus was speaking _for the nonce_, i.e. quite at random. The real\r\nauthor is Ovid: 'Successore nouo uincitur omnis amor;' Remed. Amor. 462.\r\n\r\n460. _pleyen raket_, play at rackets, knocking the ball forwards and\r\nbackwards; alluding to the rebound of the ball after striking the wall.\r\n\r\n461. _Netle in, dokke out_ means, as Chaucer says, first one thing and then\r\nanother. The words are taken from a charm for curing the sting of a nettle,\r\nrepeated whilst the patient rubs in the juice from a dock-leaf. The usual\r\nformula is simply, 'in dock, out nettle,' for which see Brockett's Glossary\r\nof North-Country Words, s. v. _dockon_ (dock); but Chaucer is doubtless\r\ncorrect. He refers to a fuller form of words, given in Notes and Queries,\r\n1st Ser. iii. 368:--\r\n\r\n 'Nettle in, dock out--Dock in, nettle out;\r\n  Nettle in, dock out--Dock rub nettle out.'\r\n\r\nAkermann's Glossary of Wiltshire Words gives a third formula, as follows:--\r\n\r\n 'Out 'ettle, in dock--Dock shall ha' a new smock;\r\n         'Ettle zhan't ha' narrun.'\r\n\r\ni.e. nettle shan't have ne'er one. See also N. and Q. 1st Ser. iii. 205,\r\n368; xi. 92; Athenæum, Sept. 12, 1846; Brand, Pop. Antiq. iii. 315.\r\n\r\nIn the Testament of Love, Bk. i., the present passage is quoted in the\r\nfollowing form: 'Ye wete wel, lady, eke (quod I) that _I haue not playde\r\nracket, nettyl in, docke out_, and with the wethercocke waued;' ed. 1550,\r\nfol. cccv. col. 2. This shews that the text is correct.\r\n\r\n462. 'Now ill luck befall her, that may care for thy wo.'\r\n\r\n481-3. _gabbestow_, liest thou. Ll. 482, 3 are a reproduction of Pandarus'\r\nown saying, in Bk. iii. 1625-8.\r\n\r\n493. Deficient in the first foot; read--'I | that liv'd' | &c.\r\n\r\n497. _formely_; Cm. _formaly_; for _formelly_, i.e. formally.\r\n\r\n503. From Boethius, Bk. i. Met. 1. 13, 14 (p. 1).\r\n\r\n506. Troilus speaks as if dead already. 'Well wot I, whilst I lived in\r\npeace, before thou (death) didst slay me, I would have given (thee) hire;'\r\ni.e. a bribe, not to attack me.\r\n\r\n520. _alambyk_, alembic; i.e. a retort, or vessel used in distilling; in\r\nCant. Ta. G 794, MS. E. has the pl. _alambikes_, and most other MSS. have\r\n_alembikes_. The word was afterwards split up into _a lembick_ or _a\r\nlimbeck_; see Macb. i. 7. 67. Chaucer took this from Le Rom. de la Rose,\r\n6406-7:--\r\n\r\n 'Je vois maintes fois que tu plores\r\n  Cum alambic sus alutel.'\r\n\r\n556. 'Then think I, this would injure her reputation.'\r\n\r\n583. 'But if I had so ardent a love, and had thy rank.'\r\n\r\n588. Cf. the phrase 'a nine days' wonder.' Lat. _nouendiale sacrum_; Livy,\r\ni. 31.\r\n\r\n600. 'Audentes Fortuna iuuat;' Æneid. x. 284; 'Fortes Fortuna adiuuat';\r\nTerence, Phormio, i. 4. 26.\r\n\r\n602. 'Unhardy is unsely;' Reves Ta. A 4210.\r\n\r\n603. For _litel_, MS. H. and Thynne have _lite_. It makes no difference,\r\neither to the sense or the scansion.\r\n\r\n607. _for ferd_, for fear (H2. _for drede_; Thynne, _for feare_). Properly\r\n_for ferde_, as in Ho. Fame, 950; but often shortened to _for ferd_.\r\n_Ferde_ or _ferd_ is tolerably common as a sb., but some scribes hardly\r\nunderstood it. Hence MSS. Cl. and H. have _of-fered_, i.e. greatly\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n618. Cf. Kn. Ta. A 1163-8; and the notes.\r\n\r\n622. 'Boldly stake the world on casts of the dice.' Cf. Cant. Tales, B 125,\r\nC 653, and the notes.\r\n\r\n627. Nearly repeated in Kn. Tale, A 1010.\r\n\r\n630. 'The devil help him that cares about it.'\r\n\r\n659-61. From Boccaccio, Fil. iv. st. 78; cf. Æneid. iv. 188.\r\n\r\n683. 'And expected to please her.' _For pitous Ioye_ represents 'pietosa\r\nallegrezza,' Fil. iv. st. 80.\r\n\r\n684. 'Dear enough at a mite;' cf. note to L. G. Wom. 741.\r\n\r\n692. _on every syde_; 'd'ogni partito;' Fil. iv. 81. I suppose it means,\r\nliterally, 'on every side;' Troy being subject to attacks at various\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n708-14. Certainly genuine; found also in Fil. iv. 84.\r\n\r\n716. Deficient in the first foot.\r\n\r\n735. Dr. Furnivall says that MSS. Cl., H., and others have here misplaced a\r\nstanza, meaning that ll. 750-6 should have come next, as shewn by\r\nBoccaccio's text. But only MS. Cm. has such an order, and it is quite\r\ncertain that the other MSS. are right. The order in Boccaccio's text\r\nfurnishes no real guide, as Chaucer often transposes such order; and it is\r\nodd that only this _one_ instance should have been noted. It is better to\r\nconsider the order in MS. Cm. as wrong, and to say that it transposes the\r\ntext by placing ll. 750-6 after l. 735, and gives a somewhat different\r\nversion of ll. 750-2.\r\n\r\n736. _ounded_, waved, wavy; see Ho. Fame, 1386, and note. Cf. 'Tear my\r\nbright hair,' &c.; Shak. Troilus, iv. 2. 112.\r\n\r\n750. Cf. note to l. 735. MS. Cm., which inserts this stanza after l. 735,\r\nbegins thus:--\r\n\r\n 'The salte teris from hyre ey[gh]yn tweyn\r\n  Out ran, as schour of Aprille ful swythe;\r\n  Hyre white brest sche bet, and for the peyne,' &c.\r\n\r\n762. This line, giving the name of Criseyde's mother, is not in Boccaccio\r\n(Fil. iv. stt. 89-93). I do not know where Chaucer found the form _Argyve_;\r\nin Statius, Theb. ii. 297, _Argia_ is the name of the wife of Polynices,\r\nand Ch. calls her _Argyve_; see Bk. v. l. 1509 below.\r\n\r\n769, 70. _by-word_, proverb: 'plants without a root soon die.'\r\n\r\n782. _ordre_, order. She will pass her life in mourning and abstinence, as\r\nif she had entered a religious order.\r\n\r\n790. _Elysos_, Elysium. It looks as if Chaucer was thinking of Vergil's\r\n'Elysios ... campos;' Georg. i. 38; for the story of Orpheus and Eurydice\r\noccurs in Georg. iv. 453-527. Cf. Ovid, Met. x. 1-85.\r\n\r\n829. _cause causinge_, the primary cause. '_Causa causans_, a primary or\r\noriginal cause; _causa causata_, a secondary or intermediate cause;' New E.\r\nDict., s. v. _Causa_.\r\n\r\n831. _Wher_, short for _whether_; as in Cant. Ta. B 3119, &c.\r\n\r\n836. 'Extrema gaudii luctus occupat;' Prov. xiv. 13. See note to Man of\r\nLawes Ta. B 421.\r\n\r\n842. The first foot is deficient: 'Peyn | e tor | ment,' &c.\r\n\r\n843. 'There is no misery that is not within my body.'\r\n\r\n850. _resport_, regard; see note to l. 86 above.\r\n\r\n865. Compare the similar lines in Kn. Ta. A 1400, 1.\r\n\r\n866. _men_, weakened form of _man_, takes a sing. verb.\r\n\r\n870. _Bi-trent_, winds round; see note to iii. 1231.\r\n\r\n884. _into litel_, within a little, very nearly.\r\n\r\n887. _fawe_, gladly; cf. Cant. Ta. D 220.\r\n\r\n907. _bane_, destruction; see Kn. Ta. A 1097, 1681.\r\n\r\n927. 'Be to him rather a cause of the _flat_ than of the _edge_,' i.e. of\r\nhealing rather than of harming. A curious allusion which is fully explained\r\nby reference to the Squieres Tale, F 156-165. See also note to the same, F\r\n238.\r\n\r\n947-1085. This passage is not in Boccaccio, but some of it is in Boethius;\r\nsee below.\r\n\r\n963-1078. A considerable portion of this passage is copied, more or less\r\nclosely, from Boethius, lib. v. Pr. 2 and Pr. 3. The correspondences are\r\nall pointed out below. Chaucer's own prose translation should be compared.\r\nFor example, the word _wrythen_ (l. 986) appears in that also (Bk. v. Pr.\r\n3. 15).\r\n\r\n963-6. 'Quae tamen ille, ab aeterno cuncta prospiciens, prouidentiae cernit\r\nintuitus, et suis quaeque meritis praedestinata disponit;' Boeth. v. Pr. 2\r\n(end).\r\n\r\n968. _grete clerkes_; such as Boethius, Saint Augustine, and bishop\r\nBradwardine; see Non. Pr. Ta. B 4431, 2.\r\n\r\n974-80. 'Nam si cuncta prospicit Deus, neque falli ullo modo potest,\r\neuenire necesse est, quod prouidentia futurum esse praeuiderit. Quare si ab\r\naeterno non facta hominum modo, sed etiam consilia uoluntatesque\r\npraenoscit, nulla erit arbitrii libertas;' Boeth. v. Pr. 3. 981-7\r\n(_continued_): 'neque enim uel factum aliud ullum, uel quaelibet existere\r\npoterit uoluntas, nisi quam nescia falli prouidentia diuina praesenserit.\r\nNam si res aliorsum, quam prouisae sunt, detorqueri ualent, non iam erit\r\nfuturi firma praescientia.' 988-994 (_continued_): 'sed opinio potius\r\nincerta: quod de Deo credere nefas iudico.'\r\n\r\n996. I.e. who have received the tonsure.\r\n\r\n997-1001. 'Aiunt enim, non ideo quid esse euenturum, quoniam id prouidentia\r\nfuturum esse prospexerit: sed è contrario potius, quoniam quid futurum est,\r\nid diuinam prouidentiam latere non posse;' Boeth. v. Pr. 3. 1002-1008\r\n(_continued_): 'eoque modo necessarium hoc in contrariam relabi partem.\r\nNeque enim necesse est contingere, quae prouidentur; sed necesse esse, quae\r\nfutura sunt, prouideri.' 1009-1015 (_continued_): 'Quasi uero, quae\r\ncuiusque rei caussa sit, praescientiane futurorum necessitatis, an\r\nfuturorum necessitas prouidentiae, laboretur.' 1016-1022 (_continued_): 'At\r\nnos illud demonstrare nitamur, quoquo modo sese habeat ordo caussarum,\r\nnecessarium esse euentum praescitarum rerum, etiam si praescientia futuris\r\nrebus eueniendi necessitatem non uideatur inferre.'\r\n\r\n(The negative in l. 1016 is remarkable, but Chaucer's prose rendering\r\npresents the same form. Surely he has taken _nitamur_ as if it were\r\n_uitamus_.)\r\n\r\n1023-9. (_continued_): 'Etenim si quispiam sedeat, opinionem quae eum\r\nsedere coniectat ueram esse necesse est: atque è conuerso rursus, (1030-6)\r\nsi de quopiam uera sit opinio, quoniam sedet, eum sedere necesse est. In\r\nutroque igitur necessitas inest: in hoc quidem sedendi, at uerò in altero\r\nueritatis.' 1037-1047 (_continued_): 'Sed non idcirco quisque sedet,\r\nquoniam uera est opinio; sed haec potius uera est, quoniam quempiam sedere\r\npraecessit. Ita cùm caussa ueritatis ex altera parte procedat, inest tamen\r\ncommunis in utraque necessitas. Similia de prouidentia futurisque rebus\r\nratiocinari patet.' 1051-78 (_continued_): 'Nam etiam si idcirco, quoniam\r\nfutura sunt, prouidentur; non uero ideo, quoniam prouidentur eueniunt:\r\nnihilo minus tamen à Deo uel uentura prouideri, uel prouisa euenire necesse\r\nest: quod ad perimendam arbitrii libertatem solùm satis est. Iam uero quam\r\npraeposterum est, ut aeternae praescientiae temporalium rerum euentus\r\ncaussa esse dicatur? Quid est autem aliud arbitrari, ideo Deum futura,\r\nquoniam sunt euentura, prouidere, quam putare quae olim acciderunt, caussam\r\nsummae illius esse prouidentiae? Ad haec, sicuti cum quid esse scio, id\r\nipsum esse necesse est: ita cum quid futurum noui, id ipsum futurum necesse\r\nest. Sic fit igitur, ut euentus praescitae rei nequeat euitari.'\r\n\r\n1094. _ferd_, fared; not the pp. of _faren_ (l. 1087), but of the weak verb\r\n_feren_ (A. S. _f[=e]ran_). The correct pp. of _faren_ is _faren_. See\r\nStratmann.\r\n\r\n1105. 'A man may offer his neck soon enough when it (i. e. his head) must\r\ncome off.'\r\n\r\n1136. 'Beyond the nature of tears.'\r\n\r\n1139. Myrrha, daughter of Cinyras, king of Cyprus, who was changed into a\r\nmyrrh-tree; Ovid, Met. x. 298. The tree wept tears of myrrh; id. x. 500.\r\n\r\n1146. _hir-e_ (MS. Cl. _here_), their, is here dissyllabic. _unswelle_,\r\ncease to swell, as in Bk. v. 214.\r\n\r\n1147. 'All hoarse, and exhausted with shrieking.' _forshright_ is the pp.\r\nof _forshriken_, to shriek excessively. Bell wrongly has _for shright_; but\r\n_shright_ is not a noun. The Ital. has 'con _rotta_ voce,' with broken\r\nvoice; Fil. iv. st. 116.\r\n\r\n1153. 'Being always on the point of departing.'\r\n\r\n1162. 'Whether it was sad for him.'\r\n\r\n1174. Cf. 'And _bisily_ gan,' &c.; Prol. A 301.\r\n\r\n1179. _preignant_ (F. _preignant_, _pregnant_, Cotgrave), catching hold of\r\ntightly, hence, forcible; pres. part. of _prendre_, to seize. Quite\r\ndistinct from _pregnant_ when representing Lat. _praegnans_.\r\n\r\n1181. _woon_, hope, resource. This answers to Early E. _w[=a]n_ (see\r\nStratmann), and is allied to Icel. _ván_, hope, expectation; cf. Icel.\r\n_væna_, to hope for, to ween. The word is monosyllabic, and the long _o_ is\r\n'open,' as shewn by its riming with _noon_, _goon_, from A. S. _n[=a]n_,\r\n_g[=a]n_. Bell quite fails to explain it, and Morris suggests 'remedy,'\r\nwithout assigning any reason. It is common in Rob. of Gloucester, with\r\nsimilar rimes, and does not mean 'custom' or 'habit' or 'manner,' as\r\nsuggested in Mr. Wright's Glossary, nor has it any connection with M. E.\r\n_wone_, custom, which was dissyllabic, and had a short vowel in the former\r\nsyllable; but it means, as here, 'hope' or 'resource.' For example: 'tho he\r\nne sey other _won_' = when he saw nothing else to be done; Rob. Glouc. ed.\r\nHearne, p. 12; ed. Wright, l. 275. 'And flowe in-to hor castles, vor hii\r\nnadde other _won_,' i. e. no other resource; id. p. 19, ed. Hearne, l. 442.\r\nThis is one of the rather numerous words in Chaucer that have not been\r\nrightly understood.\r\n\r\n1185. _twighte_, plucked; pt. t. of _twicchen_.\r\n\r\n1188. 'Where the doom of Minos would assign it a place.' Boccaccio here\r\nuses the word _inferno_ (Fil. iv. 120) to denote the place where Troilus'\r\nsoul would dwell; which Rossetti explains to mean simply Hades. Chaucer's\r\nmeaning is the same; he is referring to Æneid. vi. 431-3.\r\n\r\n1208. Atropos is the Fate who cuts the thread of life; see note to v. 7.\r\n\r\n1237. _a forlong wey_, two minutes and a half, to speak exactly; see note\r\nto C. T., A 3637.\r\n\r\n1241. Either _slayn_ is here expanded into _slayen_, or the pause after\r\nthis word does duty for a syllable, in the scansion.\r\n\r\n1242. _ho_, stop, cease; see Kn. Ta. A 1706.\r\n\r\n1244. _ther-e_ is here made into a dissyllable.\r\n\r\n1245. _morter_, mortar. The Century Dict. quotes from Dugdale's Hist. of\r\nSt. Paul's (ed. Ellis), p. 27: 'A _mortar_ was a wide bowl of iron or\r\nmetal; it rested upon a stand or branch, and was filled either with fine\r\noil or wax, which was kept burning by means of a broad wick [at funerals or\r\non tombs].' It was named from its similarity in shape to the _mortar_ in\r\nwhich things were pounded. I remember the word in common use; it came to\r\ndenote what is now called a _night-light_, and the word _night-light_ seems\r\nto have nearly displaced it. In this modern contrivance, the old 'mortar'\r\nis sometimes represented by a paper casing. The term was frequently\r\napplied, not merely to the saucer which held the grease, but to the light\r\nitself, which sometimes took the shape of a short candle. Cotgrave explains\r\nF. _mortier_ as 'a kind of small chamber-lamp.' Instead of _morter_, MS.\r\nCm. has _percher_, which meant a kind of wax candle placed upon a branch or\r\nbar called a _perche_ (perch).\r\n\r\n1295. 'About that (there) is no question.' Cf. l. 1694.\r\n\r\n1374. _wether_, sheep. I. e. it is advisable to give the wolf a limb of a\r\nsheep, in order to save the rest.\r\n\r\n1377. _grave_, incise, make an impression upon.\r\n\r\n1380. _moble_ (H., H2. _moeble_), movable property; cf. F. _meubles_.\r\n\r\n1404. 'Whilst he is making his divination; and I will make him believe.'\r\nLl. 1401-14 are due to a passage in Guido; see allit. Destruction of Troy,\r\n8101-40.\r\n\r\n1406. _amphibologyes_, ambiguities. A more correct form is _amphiboly_,\r\nfrom Gk. [Greek: amphibolia]; see New E. Dict. The ambiguous character of\r\nthe old oracular responses is well known.\r\n\r\n1411. 'When he started away from Delphi for fear.' Cf. l. 607.\r\n\r\n1422. See note to Book i. 463.\r\n\r\n1425. _the selve wit_, the same opinion.\r\n\r\n1435. _clere_, clear of woe, free, light. MS. H. has _chere_.\r\n\r\n1453. 'The bear has one opinion, and his leader another.'\r\n\r\n1456. Repeated in Kn. Ta. A 2449; see note.\r\n\r\n1459. 'With eyes like Argus;' i. e. seeing everywhere. Argus had a hundred\r\neyes; Ovid, Met. i. 625.\r\n\r\n1483. _fere_, frighten, terrify; as in Bk. ii. 124.\r\n\r\n1505. 'To lose the substance, for the sake of something accidentally\r\nrepresenting it;' as when the dog dropped the piece of meat, in his anxiety\r\nto get the shadow (or reflected image) of it. As to the famous words\r\n_substance_ and _accident_, see note to Pard. Ta. C 539.\r\n\r\n1525. _go we_, let us go; also written _gowe_, P. Plowm. B. Pr. 226.\r\n\r\n1538-40. Juno caused Athamas, the husband of Ino, to run mad. As Ovid tells\r\nthe story, Juno descended into hell, and crossed the Styx, in order to\r\npersuade the fury Tisiphone to haunt Athamas. Hence the mention of the Styx\r\nwas readily suggested. See Ovid, Met. iv. 416-561, esp. l. 434. Styx was\r\nnot, as Chaucer says, 'the pit of hell,' but a river that flowed through\r\nit.\r\n\r\n1544. _Satiry and Fauny_, Satyri and Fauni, Satyrs and Fauns. Chaucer was\r\nprobably thinking of Ovid, Met. vi. 392-4, where the _Fauni_, _Satyri_, and\r\n_Nymphae_ are described as 'ruricolae, siluarum numina.' For _halve\r\ngoddes_, we now say _demigods_.\r\n\r\n1548. _Simois_, a river of Troas; Æneid. i. 100.\r\n\r\n1560. _laye_, would lie; subj. The _e_ is elided.\r\n\r\n1562. _take_, take place, be made. Thynne has _be take_, but _be_ clogs the\r\nline, and is not in the MSS.\r\n\r\n1584. 'Vincit qui patitur;' see Frank. Ta. F 773.\r\n\r\n1585. 'He who will have what he wants must give up what he likes.' Such\r\nseems to be the sense intended. _Leef_ means 'dear.' One of Heywood's\r\nproverbs is--'Nought lay down, nought take up;' and very similar to this\r\nis--'Nothing venture, nothing have.' For the second _leef_, MS. H. has\r\n_lyfe_, a reading adopted by Bell and Morris. This takes all point out of\r\nthe saying, and does not seem applicable to the case. Ll. 1587 and 1588\r\nrepeat the saying in another form, and confirm the reading in the text. Cf.\r\nBoeth. Bk. ii. Pr. 4. 98.\r\n\r\n1591, 2. _Lucina_, i. e. Diana, or the moon; cf. Kn. Ta. A 2085. 'Before\r\nthe moon pass out of the sign of Aries beyond that of Leo.' In order to\r\nthis, the moon would have to pass wholly through Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,\r\nand Leo, thus traversing a distance represented by about 4 signs, or a\r\nthird part of the whole zodiac: this would take up about the third part of\r\n28 days, or more than 9 days. This brings us, as Criseyde says, to the 10th\r\nday (l. 1595). Such a method of counting is natural enough to those that\r\nwatch the moon's course; and lovers are generally credited with taking a\r\nspecial interest in that luminary; cf. l. 1608. In the sequel, a good deal\r\nturns upon this 'tenth day.' Cf. ll. 1320, 1328, 1685; V. 239, 642, 681,\r\n1103, 1206.\r\n\r\n1608. _Cynthia_, i. e. Diana, the moon; Ovid, Met. ii. 465.\r\n\r\n1612. 'To lose one opportunity, in order to gain another.'\r\n\r\n1620. _pure_, very; as in Kn. Ta. A 1279.\r\n\r\n1628. 'Who can hold a thing that tries to get away?'\r\n\r\n             'An eel and woman,\r\n  A learned poet says, unless by th' tail\r\n  And with thy teeth thou hold, will either fail.'\r\n               The Two Noble Kinsmen, A. iii. sc. 5. l. 49.\r\n\r\n1645. 'Res est solliciti plena timoris amor;' Ovid, Her. i. 12.\r\n\r\n1667-73. In Boccaccio, a stanza of a similar character is assigned to\r\nTroilus, not to Criseyde.\r\n\r\n1677. _poeplish_; Boccaccio (Fil. iv. st. 165) has _popolesco_, which\r\nRossetti translates by 'low-bred.' Florio's Ital. Dict. has: '_popolesco_,\r\npopular, of the common people.'\r\n\r\n1682. _fórtun-è_ is trisyllabic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch gives a general notion of the relation of this Book to\r\nthe Filostrato, though Chaucer often amplifies and transposes the material\r\nin a way that it would be tedious to particularise more minutely.\r\n\r\n  TROILUS: BOOK V.

[Dante, _Par._ xiv. 28-30.]\r\n\r\n3. _Parcas_, Fates; the accusative case, as usual.\r\n\r\n7. _Lachesis_, the Fate that apportions the thread of life; often\r\nrepresented with the spindle, though this is properly the attribute of\r\nClotho alone. Clotho spins, Lachesis apportions, and Atropos cuts, the\r\nthread of life. Atropos has been mentioned above; Bk. iv. 1208, 1546.\r\nStatius mentions all three in lib. iii. of his Thebaid; Clotho at l. 556,\r\nLachesis (Lachesim putri uacuantem saecula penso) at l. 642, and Atropos at\r\nl. 68.\r\n\r\n8. For _golden tressed_, MS. Harl. 3943 has _Auricomus tressed_ (!). Cf.\r\n'Sol auricomus, cingentibus Horis;' Valerius Flaccus, Argonaut. iv. 92.\r\n\r\n12, 13. _sone of Hecuba_, Troilus; _hir_, Criseyde.\r\n\r\n15-9. Note that ll. 15, 17 rime on _-éde_, with close _e_, but ll. 16, 18,\r\n19 rime on _-ède_, with open _e_. Cf. Anelida, 299-307.\r\n\r\n22-6. Lines 22, 24 rime on _-[=o]re_, with long close _o_; ll. 23, 25, 26\r\non _-[)o]re_, with (original) short open _o_.\r\n\r\n25. _crop_, shoot, upper part of a tree. _more_, root, still in use in\r\nHants; A. S. _more_, _moru_; see P. Plowman, B. xvi. 5, C. xviii. 21.\r\n\r\n53. 'Upon the report of such behaviour of his.'\r\n\r\n65. So in Boccaccio: 'Con un falcone in pugno;' Fil. v. st. 10.\r\n\r\n67. A mistranslation. Boccaccio's word is not _valle_, a valley, but\r\n_vallo_, a rampart. The first foot lacks a syllable.\r\n\r\n71. Antenor was the Trojan, captured by the Greeks, who was restored to\r\nTroy in exchange for Thoas and Criseyde.\r\n\r\n88. _sone of Tydeus_, i. e. Diomede, often called _Tydides_; as in Æneid.\r\ni. 97, 471, &c.\r\n\r\n89. To know one's creed is very elementary knowledge.\r\n\r\n90. _by the reyne hir hente_; Rossetti thinks Chaucer misunderstood _di\r\ncolei si piglia_ (Fil. v. 13), which might mean 'takes hold of her,' but\r\nreally means 'takes a fancy to her.'\r\n\r\n98. This resembles 'to take care of No. 1.'\r\n\r\n101. _make it tough_, raise a difficulty, viz. by disparaging Troilus.\r\n\r\n106. _coude his good_, knew what was good for him, knew what he was about.\r\nBell says--'understood good manners.'\r\n\r\n128. _helply_; we now say 'helpful,' i.e. serviceable. _to my might_, to\r\nthe best of my power.\r\n\r\n143. _O god of love_, one and the same god of love.\r\n\r\n151. _this_, contracted form of _this is_. _enseled_, sealed up.\r\n\r\n158. _As paramours_, as by way of love. Cf. l. 332.\r\n\r\n180. See below (l. 530), and Man of Lawes Ta. B 697. We can read either\r\n_brast_ (burst), or _braste_ (would burst).\r\n\r\n182. _sye_, to sink down; A. S. _s[=i]gan_; see _si[gh]en_ in Stratmann.\r\n\r\n194. _mewet_, mute; as in the Court of Love, 148. _Mewet_, _muwet_, or\r\n_muet_ is from the O. F. _muët_, orig. dissyllabic, and answering to a Low\r\nLat. diminutive type _*mutettum_. The E. word is now obsolete, being\r\ndisplaced by the simple form _mute_, borrowed directly from Lat. _mutus_,\r\nwhich in O. F. became _mu_. _Mute_ is common in Shakespeare. Lydgate has:\r\n'And also clos and _muët_ as a stone;' Siege of Thebes, pt. iii. § 8. In\r\nMerlin, ed. Wheatley, p. 172, we find 'stille and _mewet_ as though thei\r\nhadde be dombe.'\r\n\r\nThe _-e_ in _mild-e_ is not elided; the A. S. _milde_ is dissyllabic.\r\n\r\n208. _Cipryde_, i.e. Cypris, or Venus; see note to Parl. Foules, 277.\r\n\r\n212. The _-ie_ in _furie_ is rapidly slurred over. _Ixion_ is accented on\r\nthe _first_ syllable. Ixion was bound, in hell, to an ever-revolving wheel;\r\nGeorg. iii. 38; Æn. vi. 601.\r\n\r\n249. _as mete_, as (for instance) dream; see l. 251.\r\n\r\n283. 'Although he had sworn (to do so) on forfeit of his head.'\r\n\r\n304. _pálestrál_, i.e. games consisting of wrestling-matches and similar\r\ncontests; from Lat. _palaestra_; see Verg. Æn. iii. 280, 281; and G.\r\nDouglas, ed. Small, vol. iii. p. 52, l. 24. There is a description of such\r\ngames, held at a funeral, in Statius, Theb. vi., which is imitated by\r\nChaucer in the Knightes Tale; see note to A 2863. _Vigile_ (l. 305) is the\r\nsame as Chaucer's _liche-wake_; see note to A 2958.\r\n\r\n306. He means that his steed, sword, and helm are to be offered up to Mars,\r\nand his shield to Pallas, at his funeral; cf. Kn. Ta. A 2889-2894.\r\n\r\n319. _Ascaphilo_, a transposed form of Ascalaphus, whom Proserpine changed\r\ninto an owl; Ovid, Met. v. 539. So also _Adriane_ for Ariadne. Bell's note,\r\nthat the form of _Ascaphilo_ is Italian, and helps to prove that Chaucer\r\nhere follows Boccaccio is misleading; for Boccaccio does not mention\r\nAscalaphus.\r\n\r\n321. Mercury was supposed to convey men's souls to Hades. See l. 1827\r\nbelow, and note.\r\n\r\n332. _paramours_, passionately; an adverb, as usual; cf. l. 158.\r\n\r\n345. _By freendes might_, by constraint of their relatives.\r\n\r\n350. _hurt_, for _hurteth_, hurts; present tense.\r\n\r\n360. On dreams, cf. Non. Pr. Ta. B 4113-4129, 4280-4.\r\n\r\n365-8. From Le Rom. de la Rose, 18709-12, q. v.\r\n\r\n379. Lit. 'Well is it, concerning dreams, to these old wives;' i.e. these\r\nold women set a value on dreams.\r\n\r\n387. Boccaccio has: 'a te stesso perdona,' i.e. spare thyself; Chaucer\r\ntakes it literally--'forgive thyself.'\r\n\r\n403. Sarpedon had been taken prisoner by the Greeks (iv. 52). Neither\r\nBoccaccio nor Chaucer explains how he had got back to Troy. See l. 431.\r\n\r\n409. _iouken_, slumber; cf. P. Plowman, C. xix. 126. It was chiefly used as\r\na term in falconry, and applied to hawks. In the Boke of St. Albans, fol. a\r\n6, we are told that it is proper to say that 'your hauke _Ioukith_, and not\r\nslepith.' From O. F. _joquier_, _jouquier_; see Godefroy.\r\n\r\n421. _of fyne force_, by very necessity.\r\n\r\n451. I read 'piëtous,' as in MS. H., not 'pitous,' for the sake of the\r\nmetre, as in Bk. iii. 1444; cf. _pietee_, id. 1033. Perhaps Chaucer was\r\nthinking of the Ital. _pietoso_. We also find the spelling _pitevous_, for\r\nwhich form there is sufficient authority; see Wyclif, 2 Tim. iii. 12, Titus\r\nii. 12; Rob. of Glouc. ed. Wright, 5884 (footnote); cf. Mod. E. _piteous_.\r\nChaucer's usual word is _pitous_, as in Cant. Ta. B 449, 1059, C 298, &c.\r\n\r\n460. _For_, because; as frequently.\r\n\r\n469. 'Fortune intended to glaze his hood still better.' To 'glaze one's\r\nhood' was to furnish a man with a glass hood, a jocular phrase for to mock\r\nor expose to attack; because a glass hood would be no defence at all.\r\nChaucer himself admirably illustrates this saying in a passage which has\r\nalready occurred above; see Bk. ii. 867.\r\n\r\n478. _her-e_ is dissyllabic; as in Ho. Fame, 980, 1014, 1885, 1912, &c.\r\n\r\n479. _congeyen us_, bid us take leave, dismiss us.\r\n\r\n484. 'Did we come here to fetch light for a fire, and run home again?' A\r\nman who borrows a light must hurry back before it goes out.\r\n\r\n505. _Hasel-wode_, hazel-wood; an allusion to a popular saying, expressive\r\nof incredulity. See note to l. 1174 below. Not the same proverb as that in\r\nBk. iii. 890.\r\n\r\n541. 'O house, formerly called the best of houses.' Bell and Morris place\r\nthe comma after _houses_.\r\n\r\n552. As to kissing the door, see note to Rom. Rose, 2676.\r\n\r\n601. Referring, probably, to Statius, Theb. i. 12--'Quod saeuae Iunonis\r\nopus.' But this refers to the wrath of Juno against Athamas rather than\r\nagainst Thebes.\r\n\r\n642. 'Wherefore, if, on the tenth night, I fail (to have) the guiding of\r\nthy bright beams for a single hour,' &c.\r\n\r\n655. Here Thynne's reading, _Lucina_, is obviously correct; see Bk. iv.\r\n1591. By the common mistake of writing _t_ for _c_, it became Lutina, and\r\nwas then changed into _Latona_. But Latona was Lucina's _mother_.\r\n\r\n664. _Pheton_, Phaethon; alluding to Ovid, Met. ii. 34, 47, &c.\r\n\r\n744. Prudence is here represented with _three_ eyes, to behold present,\r\npast, and future; but Creseyde had but _two_ eyes, and failed to see what\r\nwas to come. Cf. 'rerum fato Prudentia maior;' Georg. i. 416.\r\n\r\n763. 'I call it felicity when I have what satisfies me;' cf. the parallel\r\npassage in Prol. A 338; and Boeth. Bk. iii. Pr. 2. 6-8.\r\n\r\n769. _knotteles_; 'like a thread in which there is no knot.'\r\n\r\n784. 'Nothing venture, nothing have.'\r\n\r\n805. In Lydgate's Siege of Troye, we are told that Diomede brought 80 ships\r\nwith him 'fro Calidonye and Arge;' Bk. ii. ch. 16, in the catalogue of the\r\nships. The English alliterative Romance omits this passage. _Arge_ is the\r\ntown of Argos, ruled over by Diomede; Homer, Il. ii. 559. _Calidoine_ is\r\nCalydon, in Ætolia, of which city Tydeus, father of Diomede, was king; see\r\nl. 934, and ll. 1513-5 below.\r\n\r\n806. This description seems to be mainly Chaucer's own. It occurs again,\r\nmuch amplified, in Lydgate's Siege of Troy, Bk. ii. ch. 15, where it\r\nprecedes the description of Priam. Boccaccio says that she had 'lucent eyes\r\nand an angelic face' (Fil. i. st. 28), with which cf. l. 816. He also\r\ndescribes her as 'Accorta, savia, onesta, e costumata,' which Rossetti\r\ntranslates by 'Discerning, wise, honourable, and high-bred' (Fil. i. 11);\r\ncf. ll. 820, 821.\r\n\r\n827. Troilus is described by Guido delle Colonne; see the translations, in\r\nthe alliterative Destruction of Troy, ed. Panton and Donaldson, l. 3922,\r\nand in Lydgate's Siege of Troye, Bk. ii. ch. 16.\r\n\r\n836. Troilus was second to Hector in prowess (Bk. ii. 158, 644), but not in\r\ncourage (Bk. i. 474).\r\n\r\n837. _durring don_, daring to do, courage; where _durring_ is a sb. formed\r\nfrom _durren_, to dare. So in l. 840, _to durre don_ is 'to dare to do.' It\r\nis quite a mistake to regard _durring don_ as a compound word, as is\r\nusually done by such as are ignorant of Middle English grammar. Spenser\r\nborrowed the phrase, but may have misunderstood it. In the Globe edition of\r\nSpenser, _derring-doe_ occurs _with a hyphen_, in Shep. Kal. _Oct._ l. 65,\r\nbut _as two words_, in F. Q. ii. 4. 42, vi. 5. 37. In F. Q. ii. 7. 10, we\r\nfind 'in _der-doing_ armes,' which I leave to be explained by the\r\nomniscient critic.\r\n\r\n852. See the parallel line, Squi. Ta. F 294; cf. Bk. iii. 674.\r\n\r\n883. _as who seyth_, so to speak.\r\n\r\n892. _Manes_, the departed spirits or shades of the dead. He means that\r\neven these will dread the Greeks. The idea that they are the 'gods of pain'\r\nis taken from Vergil, Æn. vi. 743; cf. Statius, Theb. viii. 84. Boccaccio\r\nmerely has 'tra' morti in inferno'; Fil. vi. st. 16.\r\n\r\n897. _ambages_, ambiguities; adapted from Boccaccio's 'ambage' (Fil. vi.\r\nst. 17), which Ch. has to explain.\r\n\r\n911-938. These lines are fairly close to the original.\r\n\r\n934. See note above, to l. 805. B. has: 'Di Calidonia e d' Argo;' Fil. vi.\r\nst. 24.\r\n\r\n937. Tydeus, father of Diomede, is one of the chief heroes in the Thebaid\r\nof Statius, which describes the struggle between Eteocles and Polynices\r\n(called _Polymites_ in l. 938) for the possession of Thebes. Tydeus and\r\nPolynices married sisters, the daughters of Adrastus, king of Argos; hence\r\ntheir alliance. For the death of Tydeus in battle, see the conclusion of\r\nBook viii of the Thebaid. See ll. 1480-1501 below.\r\n\r\n971. _Orcades_, the Orkney islands, very remote from Rome; Juvenal, Sat.\r\nii. 161. _Inde_, India, remote from Rome in the other direction; Vergil,\r\nÆn. vi. 794. Here the point of view is transferred from Rome to Troy.\r\n\r\n975. She was a widow; Bk. i. 97. In l. 977, she lies boldly.\r\n\r\n992. 'When I see what I have never seen yet (viz. Troy taken), perhaps I\r\nwill do what I have never yet done (i. e. think of a second husband).'\r\n\r\n1013. This incident is not in Boccaccio; but it occurs in Guido delle\r\nColonne, which Chaucer must therefore have consulted. The alliterative\r\nDestruction of Troy duly records the circumstance, ll. 8092-4:--\r\n\r\n 'A gloue of that gay gate he belyue,\r\n  Drogh hit full dernly the damsell fro;\r\n  None seond but hir-selfe, that suffert full well.'\r\n\r\n1016. I. e. Venus was seen as 'the evening-star.'\r\n\r\n1018, 9. _Cynthea_, i. e. the moon; Bk. iv. 1608. In Bk. iv. l. 1591,\r\nCriseyde had promised to return before the moon passed out of the sign Leo.\r\nThis was now on the point of happening; the moon was leaving Leo, to pass\r\ninto Virgo.\r\n\r\n1020. _Signifer_, the 'sign-bearer,' the zodiac. 'This forseide hevenish\r\nzodiak is cleped the cercle of the signes;' Astrolabe, pt. i. § 21. The\r\nzodiac extended, north and south, to the breadth of 6 degrees on both sides\r\nof the ecliptic line, thus forming a belt 12 degrees wide. This included\r\nnumerous bright stars, such as Regulus ([alpha] Leonis) and Spica Virginis\r\n([alpha] Virginis), here called 'candles.' Chaucer may have found the word\r\n_Signifer_ in Claudian, In Rufinum, i. 365.\r\n\r\n1039. _he wan_, he took in battle. Thynne reads _she_; but _he_ is right.\r\nDiomede got possession of Troilus' horse, and sent it to Criseyde;\r\nwhereupon she said that Diomede might keep it for himself. Note that\r\nChaucer refers us to 'the story' for this incident; by which he means the\r\n_Historia Troiana_ of Guido. But Guido only goes as far as to say that\r\nDiomed sent Troilus' horse to Criseyde; the rest is Chaucer's addition. See\r\nthe allit. Destruction of Troy, ll. 8296-8317; and Lydgate's Siege of\r\nTroye, Bk. iii. ch. 26, ed. 1557, fol. R 4, back. Cf. Shak. Troilus, v. 5.\r\n1: '_Dio._ Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse, Present the fair\r\nsteed to my lady Cressid.' The incidents of the 'broche' and 'pensel' are\r\nChaucer's own; see Bk. iii. 1370-2.\r\n\r\n1043. _pencel_, short for _penoncel_, a little pennon or banner; here it\r\nmeans that Diomede wore a sleeve of hers as a streamer on his helmet or\r\narm. This was a common custom; cf. Shak. Troil. v. 2. 69, 169. '_Pensell_,\r\na lytel baner;' Palsgrave; and see P. Plowm. C. xix. 189.\r\n\r\n1044. _the stories elles-wher_, i.e. in another part of Guido's _Historia_,\r\nviz. in Book xxv; see the allit. Destruct. of Troy, ll. 9942-9959, and\r\nLydgate's Siege of Troye, Bk. iv. ch. 30, ed. 1557, fol. U 4.\r\n\r\n1051. I cannot find this in Guido.\r\n\r\n1062. 'My bell shall be rung;' my story shall be told.\r\n\r\n1104. I.e. 'on the morrow of which.'\r\n\r\n1107. Cf. 'laurigero ... Phoebo'; Ovid, Art. Am. iii. 389.\r\n\r\n1110. 'Nisus' daughter,' i.e. Scylla, changed into the bird _ciris_, which\r\nsome explain as a lark; see Leg. Good Wom. 1908, and note; Ovid, Met. viii.\r\n9-151; Vergil, Georg. i. 404-9.\r\n\r\n1114. _noon_, noon, mid-day; the time for dinner (see l. 1129, and Cant.\r\nTa. E 1893). See my note to Piers Plowm. C. ix. 146.\r\n\r\n1133. _cape_, gape; see Miller's Tale, A 3444, 3841 (footnotes).\r\n\r\n1140, 1. _yate_, i.e. port-cullis. _As nought ne were_, as if there were no\r\nspecial reason for it. I.e. I will make them do it, without telling them\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\n1151. Deficient in the first foot; hardly a good line.\r\n\r\n1155. 'Think it not tedious to (have to) wait.'\r\n\r\n1162. _fare-cart_, cart for provisions; cf. our phrase 'to enjoy good\r\n_fare_.' It might mean 'travelling-car,' but that is inapplicable. B. has\r\nsimply 'carro;' Fil. vii. 8.\r\n\r\n1163-9. Cf. Romeo's speech in Rom. v. 1. 1-11.\r\n\r\n1174. 'The happiness which you expect will come out of the wood,' i.e. if\r\nit comes at all. A jocular form of expressing unlikelihood. There is\r\nevidently a reference to some popular song or saying; compare the Jeu de\r\nRobin in Toynbee's Specimens of Old French, p. 224. In the Rom. of the\r\nRose, 7455, we have an allusion to a 'ioly Robin,' who was a gay dancer and\r\na minstrel, and the exact opposite of a Jacobin friar. Shakespeare's clown\r\nin Twelfth Night (iv. 2. 78) sings of a 'jolly Robin' whose lady 'loves\r\nanother.' And Ophelia sang 'bonny sweet Robin is all my joy;' Haml. iv. 5.\r\n187.\r\n\r\n1176. Another proverbial saying, _ferne yere_, last year; see _fern, fürn_,\r\nin Stratmann, and cf. A. S. _fyrng[=e]arum fr[=o]d_, wise with the\r\nexperience of past years, Phoenix, 219. Last year's snow will not be seen\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n1190. He persuades himself that the moon is to pass well beyond the end of\r\nthe sign Leo; thus allowing another day.\r\n\r\n1222. _by potente_, with a stick, or staff with a spiked end and\r\ncrutch-like top; cf. Somp. Ta. D 1776. A _potent_, in heraldry, is a figure\r\nresembling the top of a crutch, consisting of a rectangle laid horizontally\r\nabove a small square. See Rom. of the Rose, 368.\r\n\r\n1274. 'Whereas I daily destroy myself by living.'\r\n\r\n1313. _rolleth_, revolves; see Pard. Ta. C 838; Somn. Ta. D 2217.\r\n\r\n1335. 'And for that which is defaced, ye may blame the tears.'\r\n\r\n1354. 'I sigh with sorrowful sighs.' MS. Cm. has _sikis I sike_.\r\n\r\n1368. 'I can only say that, being a receptacle for every sorrow, I was\r\nstill alive.' _cheste_, box; like that of Pandora.\r\n\r\n1372. 'Until I see the contents of your reply.'\r\n\r\n1431. 'Bottomless promises;' i. e. that held nothing.\r\n\r\n1433. See the parallel line, Kn. Ta. A 1838, and note.\r\n\r\n1450. _Sibille_, the Sibyl, the prophetess; not here a proper name, but an\r\nepithet of Cassandra. Cf. Æneid. vi. 98.\r\n\r\n1464. (Ll. 1457-1512 are not in Boccaccio.) The story of Meleager and the\r\nCalydonian boar-hunt is told at length in Ovid, Met. viii. 271, &c.; whence\r\nChaucer doubtless took it; cf. l. 1469 with Met. viii. 282. The 'mayde,' in\r\nl. 1473, was Atalanta.\r\n\r\n1480. Chaucer seems to be mistaken here. Tydeus, according to one account,\r\nwas Meleager's brother; and, according to another, his half-brother. He\r\ndoes not tell us to what 'olde bokes' he refers.\r\n\r\n1483. _moder_; his mother Althaea; see Ovid, Met. viii. 445.\r\n\r\nLATIN LINES: Argument of the 12 books of the Thebaid of Statius. These\r\nlines are placed, in the MSS., after l. 1498, interrupting the connection.\r\nI therefore insert them after l. 1484, which is certainly their proper\r\nplace. Ll. 1485-1510 give a loose rendering of them. I subjoin an epitome,\r\nin a more intelligible form; but suppress many details not mentioned in\r\nChaucer.\r\n\r\nBOOK I. Polynices and Tydeus meet, and become allies.\r\n\r\nII. Tydeus sets out on an embassy to Eteocles at Thebes, and escapes an\r\nambush by the way (ll. 1485-1491). He spares Mæon, one of his 50\r\nassailants, and sends him to Thebes with the news, whilst he himself\r\nreturns to Argos instead of proceeding to Thebes (1492-3).\r\n\r\nIII. Maeon (also called Haemonides, as being the son of Haemon, Bk. iii. l.\r\n42) returns to Thebes, and relates how Tydeus had slain 49 men out of 50.\r\nAt Argos, Amphiaraus, the augur, had concealed himself, hoping to delay the\r\nwar against Thebes, which he prophesied would be disastrous; but Capaneus\r\nforces him from his retirement, and war is resolved upon (1494).\r\n\r\nIV. The seven chiefs set out against Thebes. The army suffers from thirst,\r\nbut Hypsipyle, a Lemnian princess, appears, and shews them a river (1495).\r\n\r\nV. Hypsipyle relates the story of 'the furies of Lemnos,' i. e. of the\r\nLemnian women who killed all the men in the island except Thoas, her\r\nfather, whom she saved. (See Leg. of Good Women, 1467, and note.) While she\r\nis speaking, a snake, sent by Jupiter, kills her infant, named Archemorus.\r\nThe snake is killed by Capaneus (1497, 8).\r\n\r\nVI. Description of the obsequies of Archemorus, and of the funeral games\r\n(1499).\r\n\r\nVII. Description of the temple of Mars (see Knightes Tale). The allies\r\narrive before Thebes, and the city is attacked. Amphiaraus is swallowed up\r\nby an earthquake (1500).\r\n\r\nVIII. Tydeus is slain, after a great slaughter of his enemies (1501).\r\n\r\nIX. Hippomedon, after great deeds of valour, is drowned in the river. Death\r\nof Parthenopaeus (1502, 3).\r\n\r\nX. Capaneus is killed by lightning whilst scaling the walls of Thebes\r\n(1504, 5).\r\n\r\nXI. Single combat between Eteocles and Polynices; both are slain (1506-8).\r\n\r\nXII. Creon forbids the burial of the slain invaders. The wives of the six\r\nchieftains seek assistance from Theseus, king of Athens (see Knightes\r\nTale). Argia, wife of Polynices, finds and burns her husband's body.\r\nTheseus slays Creon, and the Thebans open their gates to him (1509-10).\r\n\r\n1485-1491. From the Thebaid, Bk. i (see above). _felawe_, comrade,\r\nbrother-in-law. _Polymites_, Polynices. _Ethyocles_, Eteocles.\r\n\r\n1492-8. From the same, Books ii-v. _Hemonides_, Haemonides, i. e. Maeon,\r\nson of Haemon. _asterte_, escaped. _fifty_; but he only slew 49, though\r\nattacked by 50. _sevene_; the seven chieftains, who went to besiege Thebes.\r\n_holy serpent_, the snake sent by Jupiter. _welle_, (apparently) the stream\r\nLangia, which refreshed the army (end of Bk. iv). _The furies_, the furious\r\nwomen of Lemnos, who killed all the males (but one) in the island.\r\n\r\n1499-1505. From the same, Bks. vi-x. _Archimoris_, Archemorus, infant son\r\nof Hypsipyle; honoured by funeral games. _Amphiorax_, Amphiaraus; see Bk.\r\nii. 105, and note to Anelida, 57. _Argeyes_, Argives, people of Argos.\r\n_Ypomedon_, Hippomedon; _Parthonope_, Parthenopaeus; see note to Anelida,\r\n58. _Cappaneus_, Capaneus; see note to Anelida, 59.\r\n\r\n1506-1512. From the same, Bks. xi, xii. _Argyve_, Argia, wife of Polynices;\r\ncf. Bk. iv. l. 762, above. _brent_, burnt; see Kn. Ta. A 990; but Statius\r\nsays that the Thebans opened their gates to Theseus, who entered in\r\ntriumph. I find nothing about any harm done to the city on this occasion.\r\n\r\n1514. But Tydeus was Meleager's brother; see note to l. 1480.\r\n\r\n1518. _leef_, leave it alone. Usually _leve_.\r\n\r\n1523. _seestow_, seest thou; a general observation, _not_ addressed to\r\nCassandra in particular, but to every one at large.\r\n\r\n1527. _Alceste_, Alcestis; see Leg. of Good Women, 432.\r\n\r\n1528. _but_, except, unless. Yet Bell misunderstands it.\r\n\r\n1530. _housbonde_; Admetus, king of Pherae, in Thessaly.\r\n\r\n1545. _smitted_, smutted, disgraced; cf. l. 1546.\r\n\r\n1548. _fyn of the paródie_, end of the period. Chaucer, not being a Greek\r\nscholar, has somewhat mistaken the form of the word; but, in MS. H.,\r\n_parodie_ is duly glossed by 'duracion,' shewing the sense intended. It is\r\nfrom the O. F. fem. sb. _perióde_, or _peryóde_, of which Littré gives an\r\nexample in the 14th century: '_Peryode_ est le temps et la mesure de la\r\n_duracion_ d'une chose;' Oresme, Thèse de Meunier. Chaucer, being more\r\nfamiliar with the prefix _per-_ than with the Greek [Greek: peri-], has\r\ndropped the _i_; and the confusion between _per-_ and _par-_ is extremely\r\ncommon, because both prefixes were denoted, in contracted writing, by the\r\nsame symbol. We may give up the old attempts at explaining the word\r\notherwise, as we know that the glosses are usually due to the author. 'The\r\nend of the period of Hector's life was nigh at hand.'\r\n\r\nLydgate uses the word in the same sense, having caught it up from the\r\npresent passage:--\r\n\r\n 'When the _paródye_ of this worthy knyght [Hector]\r\n  Aproche shall, without[e] wordes mo,\r\n  Into the fyelde playnly if he go.'\r\n           Siege of Troye, Bk. iii. ch. 27; ed. 1557, fol. R 6.\r\n\r\n 'And how that he [Ulysses] might[e] not escape\r\n  The _párodye_ that was for hym shape;\r\n  For Parchas haue his last[e] _terme_ set,' &c.\r\n                               Id., Bk. v. ch. 38; fol. Dd 3.\r\n\r\nObserve that _parodye_ is here equated to _terme_.\r\n\r\n1558. From Guido; according to whose account Hector, having taken a\r\nprisoner, was conveying him through the throng, when Achilles thrust him\r\nthrough with a spear in a cowardly manner, stealing up to him unperceived.\r\nSee allit. Dest. of Troy, ll. 8649-8660; Lydgate, Siege of Troy, Bk. iii.\r\nch. 27, fol. S 2, back; Shak. Troil. v. 6. 27, 8. 1.\r\n\r\n1634. _kalendes_, an introduction to the beginning; see note to Bk. ii. 7.\r\n\r\n1653. _Lollius_; this incident is in the Filostrato, viii. st. 8; I do not\r\nfind it in Guido.\r\n\r\n1669. _word and ende_, beginning and end; see note to Monk. Ta. B 3911; and\r\nnote to Bk. ii. 1495.\r\n\r\n1689. 'To present your new love with.'\r\n\r\n1760. See note to Book i. 463.\r\n\r\n1764. Here the story practically ends. Beyond this point, the lines taken\r\nfrom Boccaccio are less than twenty.\r\n\r\n1771. _Dares_, i. e. Guido, who professes to follow Dares; see note to Book\r\nDuch. 1070.\r\n\r\n1778. I. e. Chaucer was beginning to think of his Legend of Good Women.\r\n\r\n1786. Here begins the Envoy (interrupted by ll. 1800-1827). Compare the\r\nlast three lines of the Filostrato (ix. 8):--\r\n\r\n 'Or va'; ch' io prego Apollo che ti presti\r\n  Tanto di grazia ch' ascoltata sii,\r\n  E con lieta risposa a me t'invii.'\r\n\r\n1787. 'Whereas may God send power to him that wrote thee to take part in\r\ncomposing some \"comedy,\" before he die.'\r\n\r\n1789. 'Do not envy any (other) poetry, but be humble.'\r\n\r\n1791. Imitated from the concluding lines of the Thebaid, xii. 816:--\r\n\r\n           'nec tu diuinam Æneida tenta,\r\n  Sed longe sequere, et _uestigia semper adora_.'\r\n\r\nThe sense is--'And kiss their footsteps, wherever you see Vergil, &c. pass\r\nalong.' The reading _space_ is ridiculous; and, in l. 1792, the names\r\n_Virgíle_, &c., are accented on the second syllable. _Steppes_ means\r\n'foot-prints,' Lat. _uestigia_; see Leg. Good Women, 2209.\r\n\r\n1792. An important line. Chaucer, in this poem, has made use of Statius\r\n(see l. 1485), Ovid (in many places), Vergil (occasionally), and Homer (not\r\nat first hand). Lucan seems to be mentioned only out of respect; but see\r\nnote to Bk. ii. 167. He is mentioned again in Boethius, Bk. iv. Pr. 6. 159.\r\n\r\n1796. _mismetre_, scan wrongly. This shews that Chaucer was conscious of\r\nhis somewhat archaic style, and that there was a danger that some of the\r\nsyllables might be dropped.\r\n\r\n1797. _red_, read (by a single person), _songe_, read aloud, recited in an\r\nintoned voice.\r\n\r\n1802. _thousandes_ is to be taken in the literal sense. On one occasion,\r\naccording to Guido, Troilus slew a thousand men at once. See the allit.\r\nDestruction of Troy, 9878; Lydgate, Siege of Troy, fol. U 3, back, l. 7.\r\n\r\n1806. So in Guido; see allit. Destr. of Troy, 10302-11; Lydgate, Siege of\r\nTroye, Bk. iv. ch. 31. Cf. l. 1558, and the note.\r\n\r\n1807-1827. These three stanzas are from Boccaccio's _Teseide_, xi. 1-3,\r\nwhere, however, they refer to Arcita:--\r\n\r\n 'Finito Arcita colei nominando\r\n  La qual nel mondo più che altro amava,\r\n  L'anima lieve se ne gì volando\r\n  Vêr la concavità del cielo ottava:\r\n  Degli elementi i conuessi lasciando,\r\n  Quivi le stelle erratiche ammirava ...\r\n  Suoni ascoltando pieni di dolcezza.\r\n\r\n  Quindi si volse in giù a rimirare\r\n  Le cose abbandonate, e vide il poco\r\n  Globo terreno, a cui d'intorno il mare\r\n  Girava ...\r\n  Ed ogni cosa da nulla stimare\r\n  A respetto del ciel; e in fine al loco\r\n  Là dove aveva il corpo suo lasciato\r\n  Gli occhi fermò alquanto rivoltato.\r\n\r\n  E fece risa de' pianti dolenti\r\n  Della turba lernea; la vanitate\r\n  Forte dannando delle umane genti,\r\n  Le qua' da tenebrosa cechitate\r\n  Mattamente oscurate nelle menti\r\n  Seguon del Mondo la falsa beltate:\r\n  Lasciando il cielo, quindi se ne gio\r\n  Nel loco a cui Mercurio la sortio.'\r\n\r\n_holownesse_ translates 'concavità.' For _seventh_, B. has 'ottava,'\r\neighth. The seventh sphere is that of Saturn, from which he might be\r\nsupposed to observe the motion of Saturn and of all the inferior planets.\r\nBut surely _eighth_ is more correct; else there is no special sense in\r\n'holownesse.' The eighth sphere is that of the fixed stars; and by taking\r\nup a position on the _inner_ or _concave_ surface of this sphere, he would\r\nsee all the planetary spheres revolving within it. (The 'spheres' were\r\nsupposed to be concentric shells, like the coats of an onion.) The 'erratic\r\nstars,' or wandering stars, are the seven planets. As to the music of their\r\nspheres, see notes to Parl. Foules, ll. 59 and 61.\r\n\r\n1810. _in convers leting_, leaving behind, on the other side. When, for\r\nexample, he approached the sphere of Mars, it was _concave_ to him; after\r\npassing beyond it, it appeared _convex_. Some modern editions of the\r\nTeseide read _connessi_ (connected parts), but the right reading is\r\n_conuessi_ (convex surfaces), for which Chaucer substitutes _convers_. See\r\n_converse_ in the New E. Dictionary.\r\n\r\n1815. Cf. Parl. Foules, 57. Boccaccio had in mind Cicero's _Somnium\r\nScipionis_.\r\n\r\n1825. _sholden_, and we ought; _we_ is understood.\r\n\r\n1827. _sorted_, allotted; Ital. 'sortio.'\r\n\r\n1828-1837. Chiefly from Il Filostrato, viii. 28, 29.\r\n\r\n1838-1862. These lines are Chaucer's own, and assume a higher strain.\r\n\r\n1840. 'This lyf, my sone, is but a chery-feyre.'\r\n           Hoccleve, De Regim. Princ. ed. Wright, p. 47.\r\n\r\nSee four more similar comparisons in Halliwell's Dict., s. v.\r\n_Cherry-fair_.\r\n\r\n1856. _moral Gower._ This epithet of Gower has stuck to him ever since; he\r\nmoralises somewhat too much.\r\n\r\n1857. _Strode._ Concerning this personage, Leland discovered the following\r\nnote in an old catalogue of the worthies of Merton College, Oxford:\r\n'Radulphus Strode, nobilis poeta fuit et versificavit librum elegiacum\r\nvocatum Phantasma Radulphi.' In the introduction to his edition of 'Pearl,'\r\np. l., Mr. Gollancz says: 'This Ralph Strode is identical with the famous\r\nphilosopher of that name whose philosophical works hold an important place\r\nin the history of medieval logic. He was also famous in his time as a\r\ncontroversialist with Wiclif, and from Wiclif MSS., still unprinted, it is\r\npossible to gain some insight into Strode's religious views.' He was,\r\nperhaps, related to the philosopher N. Strode, who is mentioned at the end\r\nof pt. ii. § 40 of the Treatise on the Astrolabe as being the tutor, at\r\nOxford, of Chaucer's son Lewis.\r\n\r\n1863-5. From Dante, Paradiso, xiv. 28-30:--\r\n\r\n 'Quell' uno e due e tre che sempre vive,\r\n  E regna sempre in tre e due e uno,\r\n  Non circonscritto, e tutto circonscrive.'\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTE TO BOOK III. 674.\r\n\r\nAs the curious word _voidee_ has been suppressed in all previous editions,\r\nI add some more examples of it, for some of which I am indebted to Dr.\r\nMurray. It occurs, e.g., in the extremely interesting account of the death\r\nof James I of Scotland.\r\n\r\n'Within an owre the Kyng askid the _voidee_, and drank, the travers yn the\r\nchambure edraw [= _y-drawe_, drawn], and every man depairtid and went to\r\nrist': (1400) JN. SHIRLEY, Dethe of James Stewarde, Kyng of Scotys, p. 13,\r\ned. 1818.\r\n\r\nHence, no doubt, Mr. Rossetti, in his poem of The King's Tragedy, drew the\r\nline:--'Then he called for the _voidee_-cup.'\r\n\r\n'A _voidy_ of spices': (1548) Hall's Chron. 14 Hen. VIII.\r\n\r\n'A _voidee_ of spices': (1577-87) Holinshed's Chron. vol. iii. p. 849.\r\n\r\nIn A Collection of Ordinances and Regulations for the Royal Household,\r\nLondon, 1790, there are several examples of it.\r\n\r\n'The Archbishoppe to stand on the Kinges right hand, and the King to make\r\nhim a becke when hee shall take _spice and wine_. And when the _voide_ is\r\ndonne, then the King to goe into his chamber; and all other estates to goe\r\ninto their chambers, or where it shall please them,' &c.: p. 111; in\r\nArticles ordained by King Henry VII.\r\n\r\nAt p. 113, there are minute directions as to the _voidè_. The chamberlain\r\nand others fetch a towel, the cups, and the spice-plates; the king and the\r\nbishop take 'spice and wine,' and afterwards the lords and people are\r\nserved 'largely' with spice and wine also; after which the cups are\r\nremoved. At p. 36, we read: 'the bourde _avoyded_ [cleared] when wafyrs\r\ncome with ypocras, or with other swete wynes. The King never taketh a\r\n_voyd_ [read _voydè_] of comfites and other spices, but standing.' At p.\r\n121: 'as for the voide on twelfth day at night, the King and Queene ought\r\nto take it in the halle.' At the Coronation of Queen Anne Boleyn, there was\r\na voidè 'of spice-plates and wine'; English Garner, ed. Arber, ii. 50.\r\n\r\nThe _voidee_ was, in fact, a sort of dessert. The word _spices_ included\r\nmany things besides what it now implies. In the Ordinances above-mentioned,\r\nthere is a list of spices, at p. 103. It includes pepper, saffron, ginger,\r\ncloves, maces, cinnamon, nutmegs, dates, prunes, quinces, comfits, raisins,\r\ncurrants, figs, and even rice. In the North of England, even at the present\r\nday, it includes sweetmeats, gingerbread, cakes, and dried fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OXFORD EDITION\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nPIERS THE PLOWMAN\r\n\r\nIn two Volumes, demy 8vo, pp. civ + 1112, uniform with this\r\nEdition, price £1 11s. 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VISION OF WILLIAM\r\n\r\nCONCERNING\r\n\r\nPIERS THE PLOWMAN\r\n\r\n_IN THREE PARALLEL TEXTS_\r\n\r\nTOGETHER WITH\r\n\r\nRICHARD THE REDELESS\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM LANGLAND\r\n\r\n(ABOUT 1362-1399 A.D.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITED FROM NUMEROUS MANUSCRIPTS\r\n\r\n_WITH PREFACE, NOTES, AND A GLOSSARY_\r\n\r\nBY THE REV.\r\n\r\nWALTER W.

It is also tolerably obvious, that Chaucer selected Metre\r\n     5 of Book ii. of Boethius for poetical treatment in his 'Former Age,'\r\n     because Jean de Meun had selected for similar treatment the very same\r\n     passage; see Rom. de la Rose, ll. 8395-8406.\r\n\r\n[10] There is a copy of this in the British Museum, MS. Addit. 10341.\r\n\r\n[11] MS. Harl. 44 (Wülker); _not_ MS. Harl. 43, as in Warton, who has\r\n     confused this MS. with that next mentioned.\r\n\r\n[12] MS. Harl. 43 (Wülker); _not_ MS. Harl. 44, as in Warton.\r\n\r\n[13] There is a better copy than either of the above in MS. Royal 18 A.\r\n     xiii. The B. M. Catalogue of the Royal MSS., by Casley, erroneously\r\n     attributes this translation to Lydgate. And there is yet a fourth\r\n     copy, in MS. Sloane 554. The Royal MS. begins, more correctly:--'In\r\n     suffisaunce of cunnyng and of wyt.'\r\n\r\n[14] MS. i. 53.\r\n\r\n[15] MS. B. 5. There is yet another MS. in the library of Trinity College,\r\n     Oxford, no. 75; and others in the Bodleian Library (MS. Rawlinson\r\n     151), in the Cambridge University Library (Gg. iv. 18), and in the\r\n     Phillipps collection (as in note 5 below).\r\n\r\n[16] 'The Boke of Comfort, translated into Englesse tonge. Enprented in the\r\n     exempt Monastery of Tavestok in Denshyre, by me, Dan Thomas Rychard,\r\n     Monke; 1525. 4to.'--Lowndes.\r\n\r\n[17] The MS. is now in the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps; no. 1099.\r\n\r\n[18] He here implies that Chaucer's translation was by no means the only\r\n     one then in existence; a remarkable statement.\r\n\r\n[19] MS. inserts _full_, needlessly.\r\n\r\n[20] _Perhaps read_ In.\r\n\r\n[21] MS. neye.\r\n\r\n[22] MS. hy_m_self.\r\n\r\n[23] MS. theym self.\r\n\r\n[24] _Printed_ feldes _by_ Mr. Stewart.\r\n\r\n[25] Observe that this line is due to Chaucer's _gloss_, not to his text.\r\n\r\n[26] MS. Thisee (!).\r\n\r\n[27] MS. hem self.\r\n\r\n[28] _Printed_ thise _by_ Mr. Stewart.\r\n\r\n[29] MS. This (giving no sense).\r\n\r\n[30] Mr. Stewart _omits_ thus.\r\n\r\n[31] MS. parelous (!). This shews that Walton's text can be corrected by\r\n     Chaucer's.\r\n\r\n[32] Yet we must remember that 'The Former Age' only reproduces a _part_ of\r\n     this Metre; and that it also introduces a passage from Jerome, besides\r\n     reminiscences of Ovid and of Le Roman de la Rose; as shewn in the\r\n     notes.\r\n\r\n[33] Mr. Stewart adds another instance, from Bk. iii. met. 5. 5:--\r\n\r\n       And that the last ile in the see\r\n       That hight Tyle, be thral to thee.\r\n\r\n     I hope this was unintentional, for they are poor verses. It is higher\r\n     praise to say that, especially in the Metres, Chaucer's prose often\r\n     flows well, with a certain melody of its own. Mr. Stewart also gives\r\n     some instances in which he supposes that Chaucer 'actually reproduces\r\n     the original Latin metre;' but they are imperfect and unintended.\r\n\r\n[34] Mr. Stewart quotes this as: 'a long unagreable dwellynges;' but\r\n     'draweth a-long' is a fair translation of 'protrahit.'\r\n\r\n[35] 365 is the number of the line; see p. 164 below. I refer to Boethius\r\n     by the letter 'B.', meaning the text as printed in the present volume,\r\n     giving the _line_ of the text as well as the number of the Prose or\r\n     Metre, so that every passage can easily be found.\r\n\r\n[36] The prefixed asterisk marks a _doubtful_ or _wrong_ instance.\r\n\r\n[37] I omit the comparison of Bk. iii. ll. 8-14 with Boethius; for the\r\n     whole stanza is copied from the _Filostrato_, Bk. iii. st. 75. Also,\r\n     that of l. 373 with B. iii. met. 9. 1; for l. 373 is copied from the\r\n     _Filostrato_, Bk. iii. st. 15.\r\n\r\n[38] I omit mention of l. 2839 (compared with B. ii. met. 3. 14); for it is\r\n     taken from the _Teseide_, Bk. ix, 10, 11.\r\n\r\n[39] The three points are: (1) Avarice is insatiable, l. 2321, which\r\n     answers to 'finem quaerendi non inuenit,' quoted as from Seneca, but\r\n     really from Palladius; see Albertani Brixiensis Liber Consolationis,\r\n     ed. T. Sundby, p. 37: (2) Good and evil are two contraries, l. 2479;\r\n     compare the same, p. 96: (3) Fortune the nurse, l. 2635, translated\r\n     from 'fortuna usque nunc me fouit'; see the same, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[40] I have noted a few inaccuracies, chiefly due to confusion of _c_ and\r\n     _t_ (which are written alike), and to abbreviations. At p. 2, l. 13,\r\n     for 'p_ro_cede' read 'p_er_cede.' At p. 9, l. 28, for 'basilicis' read\r\n     'basilius.' At p. 11, l. 32, read 'auauntede.' At p. 12, l. 10, read\r\n     'c_on_uict'; &c. Cf. note to Bk. v. pr. 6. 82.\r\n\r\n[41] Here _recte_ is miswritten for _recta_, clearly because the scribe was\r\n     still thinking of the latter syllable of the preceding _sponte_. But\r\n     observe that Ch. has 'the rightes,' a translation of _recta_. This\r\n     proves at once that Chaucer did not use _this particular copy_ as his\r\n     original; and of course the peculiar mode in which it is written\r\n     precludes such a supposition. But I believe it to be copied from\r\n     Chaucer's copy, all the same.\r\n\r\n[42] This shews how entirely wrong an editor would be who should change the\r\n     forms into _Atrides_ and _Agamemnon_; unless, indeed, he were to give\r\n     due notice. For it destroys the evidence. Note also, that _Agamenon_\r\n     is the usual M. E. form. It appears as _Agamenoun_ in Troil. iii. 382.\r\n\r\n[43] Hence it is easy to see that when Chaucer's glosses agree, as they\r\n     sometimes do, with those in Notker's Old High German version or in any\r\n     other version, the agreement is due to the fact that both translators\r\n     had similar _Latin_ glosses before them.\r\n\r\n[44] My text has _thonder-light_, as in the MSS.; but _leyte_ or _leyt_ is\r\n     better; see note to the line (p. 422), and see above, p. xlii, l. 8.\r\n\r\n[45] There is a later edition by Peiper, said to be the best; but it is out\r\n     of print, and I failed to obtain a copy. But I have also collated the\r\n     Latin text in the Delphin edition, ed. Valpy, 1823, and the edition by\r\n     Renatus Vallinus, 1656; both of these contain useful notes.\r\n\r\n[46] Mr. Rossetti has a note, shewing that Prof. Morley's figures are\r\n     incorrect. He himself reckons _Troilus_ as containing 8246 lines,\r\n     because the number of stanzas in Book V. of Dr. Furnivall's print of\r\n     MS. Harl. 3943 is wrongly given as 268 instead of 267.\r\n\r\n[47] For a fuller comparison with this poem, see § 21 below; p. lxv.\r\n\r\n[48] Lydgate accepts Chaucer's view without question. He says--'And of this\r\n     syege wrote eke Lollius'; Siege of Troye, ed. 1555, fol. B 2, back.\r\n\r\n[49] Usually called Guido de Colonna, probably because he was supposed to\r\n     belong to a famous family named Colonna; but his name seems to have\r\n     been taken from the name of a place (see note 1 on p. lvi). My\r\n     quotations from Guido are from MS. Mm. 5. 14, in the Cambridge\r\n     University Library.\r\n\r\n[50] He refers to the story of Troy as existing 'in the Latyn and the\r\n     Frenshe'; Siege of Troye, fol. B 1, back; and explains 'the Latyn' as\r\n     'Guido.'\r\n\r\n[51] In an Italian work entitled 'Testi Inediti di Storia Trojana,' by E.\r\n     Gorra, Turin, 1887, a passage is quoted at p. 137, from Book XIII of\r\n     Guido, which says that Terranova, on the S. coast of Sicily, was also\r\n     called 'columpne Herculis,' and Gorra suggests that this was the place\r\n     whence Guido derived his name 'delle Colonne.' At any rate, Guido was\r\n     much interested in these 'columns'; see Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol.\r\n     M 4. I think _Tropæus_, from Gk. [Greek: tropaia], may refer to these\r\n     _columnæ_; or Guido may have been connected with _Tropea_, on the W.\r\n     coast of Calabria, less than fifty miles from Messina, where he was a\r\n     judge.\r\n\r\n[52] 'Homerus ... fingens multa que non fuerunt, et que fuerunt aliter\r\n     transformando'; Prologus. See the E. translation in the Gest\r\n     Hystoriale, or alliterative Troy-book, ll. 38-47; Lydgate, Siege of\r\n     Troye, fol. B 2.\r\n\r\n[53] See allit. Troy-book, ll. 60-79.\r\n\r\n[54] See allit. Troy-book, ll. 3922-34; Lydgate, Siege of Troye, fol. F 3,\r\n     back.\r\n\r\n[55] MS. penatos.\r\n\r\n[56] The mention of Escaphilo, i.e. Ascalaphus, in Book V. 319, was perhaps\r\n     suggested by the mention of Ascalaphus by Guido (after Dictys, i. 13,\r\n     Homer, Il. ii. 512) as being one of the Grecian leaders; see allit.\r\n     Troy-book, l. 4067.\r\n\r\n[57] I. e. glove; from Gk. [Greek: cheir], hand, and [Greek: thêkê], case.\r\n\r\n[58] Put for xenium ([Greek: xenion]), a gift, present.\r\n\r\n[59] Cf. 'And save hir browes ioyneden y-fere'; Troil. v. 813.\r\n\r\n[60] _Talke_ is not in the Glossary. As _lk_ is a common way of writing\r\n     _kk_ (as shewn in my paper on 'Ghost-words' for the Phil. Soc.), the\r\n     word is really _takke_, a variant of _take_; and the sense is 'let him\r\n     take.'\r\n\r\n[61] Lydgate began his Troy-book on Oct. 31, 1412, and finished it in 1420;\r\n     see this shewn in my letter to the _Academy_, May 7, 1892.\r\n\r\n[62] Hence it was not written by Sir Hugh Eglintoun, if he died either in\r\n     1376 or 1381; see Pref. to allit. Troy-book, pp. xvii, xxv.\r\n\r\n[63] MS. to disport; _but_ to _is needless_.\r\n\r\n[64] MS. I for; I _is needless_.\r\n\r\n[65] Two false rimes; _ye_ and _aweye_; _dispyt_ and _bright_ (correctly,\r\n     _bright e_).\r\n\r\n[66] Not _clene_, as in the St. John's MS. and in the Phillipps MS.; for\r\n     Chaucer never rimes _clene_ (with open _e_) with such words as\r\n     _grene_, _quene_ (with close _e_); see, on this point, the remarks on\r\n     my Rime-Index to Troilus, published for the Chaucer Society. MS. Harl.\r\n     2392 likewise has _sheene_, a word in which the long _e_ is of\r\n     'variable' quality.\r\n\r\n[67] Some guess that it means 'Tres gentil Chaucer.' But this seems to me\r\n     very improbable, if not stupid.",
