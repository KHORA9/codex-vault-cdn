In a few places I \r\nhave substituted the character forms available in the Big 5 \r\ncharacter set for rare or (what are now considered) \r\nnonstandard forms used by Legge. Characters not included in \r\nthe Big 5 character set in any form are described by their \r\nconstituent elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA note for the Unicode version\r\n\r\nThis Unicode version was made directly from the Big 5 original,\r\nand so the same note about substitute characters applies; no\r\nattempt has been made to undo the substitutions.

HSIO R.\r\n\r\n【第一章】\r\n【一節】子曰、 學而時習之、不亦說乎。【二節】有朋自遠方來、不亦樂\r\n乎。【三節】人不知而不慍、不亦君子乎。\r\n        CHAPTER I. 1. The Master said, 'Is it not pleasant to learn \r\nwith a constant perseverance and application?\r\n        2. 'Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant \r\nquarters?'\r\n        3. 'Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no \r\ndiscomposure though men may take no note of him?'\r\n\r\n【第二章】【一節】有子曰、其為人也孝弟、而好犯上者鮮矣、不好犯上、\r\n而好作亂者、未之有也。【二節】君子務本、本立、而道生、孝\r\n        CHAP. II. 1. The philosopher Yu said, 'They are few who, \r\nbeing filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their \r\nsuperiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend \r\nagainst their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.\r\n        2. 'The superior man bends his attention to what is \r\nradical.\r\n\r\n弟也者、其為仁之本與。\r\n【第三章】子曰、巧言令色、鮮矣仁。\r\n【第四章】曾子曰、吾日三省吾身、為人謀、而不忠乎、與朋友交、而不信\r\n乎、傳不習乎。\r\nThat being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. \r\nFilial piety and fraternal submission!-- are they not the root of \r\nall benevolent actions?'\r\n        CHAP. III. The Master said, 'Fine words and an \r\ninsinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.'\r\n        CHAP. IV. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I daily examine \r\nmyself on three points:-- whether, in transacting business for \r\nothers, I may have been not faithful;-- whether, in intercourse \r\nwith friends, I may have been not sincere;-- whether I may \r\nhave not mastered and practised the instructions of my \r\nteacher.'\r\n\r\n【第五章】子曰、道千乘之國、敬事而信、節用而愛人、使民以時。\r\n【第六章】子曰、弟子、入則孝、出則弟、謹而信、凡愛眾、而親仁、行有\r\n餘力、則以學文。\r\n【第七章】子夏曰、賢賢易色、事父母、能竭其力、事君、能致其身、\r\n        CHAP. V. The Master said, To rule a country of a thousand \r\nchariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and \r\nsincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the \r\nemployment of the people at the proper seasons.'\r\n        CHAP. VI. The Master said, 'A youth, when at home, \r\nshould be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should \r\nbe earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and \r\ncultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and \r\nopportunity, after the performance of these things, he should \r\nemploy them in polite studies.'\r\n        CHAP. VII. Tsze-hsia said, 'If a man withdraws his mind \r\nfrom the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love \r\nof the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his \r\nutmost strength;\r\n\r\n與朋友交、言而有信、雖曰未學、吾必謂之學矣。\r\n【第八章】【一節】子曰、君子不重、則不威、學則不固。【二節】主忠信。\r\n【三節】無友不如己者。【四節】過則勿憚改。\r\n【第九章】曾子曰、慎終追遠、民德歸厚矣。\r\nif, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his \r\nintercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-- although \r\nmen say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he \r\nhas.'\r\n        CHAP. VIII. 1. The Master said, 'If the scholar be not \r\ngrave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning \r\nwill not be solid.\r\n        2. 'Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.\r\n        3. 'Have no friends not equal to yourself.\r\n        4. 'When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.'\r\n        CHAP. IX. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Let there be a \r\ncareful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let \r\nthem be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of \r\nsacrifice;-- then the virtue of the people will resume its proper \r\nexcellence.' \r\n\r\n【第十章】【一節】子禽問於子貢曰、夫子至於是邦也、必聞其政、求之與、\r\n抑與之與。【二節】子貢曰、夫子溫､良､恭､儉､讓、以得之、夫子之求\r\n之也、其諸異乎人之求之與。\r\n【十一章】子曰、父在、觀其志、父沒、觀其行、三年無改於父之道、可謂\r\n孝矣。\r\nCHAP. X. 1. Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung, saying, 'When our \r\nmaster comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about \r\nits government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to \r\nhim?'\r\n        2. Tsze-kung said, 'Our master is benign, upright, \r\ncourteous, temperate, and complaisant, and thus he gets his \r\ninformation. The master's mode of asking information!-- is it \r\nnot different from that of other men?'\r\n        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'While a man's father is alive, \r\nlook at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his \r\nconduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of \r\nhis father, he may be called filial.'\r\n\r\n【十二章】【一節】有子曰、禮之用、和為貴、先王之道、斯為美；小大由\r\n之。【二節】有所不行、知和而和、不以禮節之、亦不可行也。\r\n【十三章】有子曰、信近於義、言可復也、恭近於禮、遠恥辱也、因不失其\r\n親、亦可宗也。\r\n【十四章】子曰、君子食無求\r\nCHAP. XII. 1. The philosopher Yu said, 'In practising the rules of \r\npropriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed \r\nby the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things \r\nsmall and great we follow them.\r\n        2. 'Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing \r\nhow such ease should be prized, manifests it, without \r\nregulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be \r\ndone.'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. The philosopher Yu said, 'When agreements \r\nare made according to what is right, what is spoken can be \r\nmade good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, \r\none keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon \r\nwhom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he \r\ncan make them his guides and masters.'\r\n        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'He who aims to be a man of \r\ncomplete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his \r\nappetite, nor\r\n\r\n飽、居無求安、敏於事、而慎於言、就有道、而正焉、可謂好學也已。\r\n【十五章】【一節】子貢曰貧、而無諂、富而無驕、何如。子曰、可也、未\r\n若貧而樂、富而好禮者也。【二節】子貢曰、詩云、如切如磋、如琢如磨、\r\n其斯之謂與。【三節】子曰、賜也、始可與言詩\r\nin his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is \r\nearnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he \r\nfrequents the company of men of principle that he may be \r\nrectified:-- such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.'\r\n        CHAP. XV. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'What do you pronounce \r\nconcerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich \r\nman who is not proud?' The Master replied, 'They will do; but \r\nthey are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, \r\nand to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.'\r\n        2. Tsze-kung replied, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"As \r\nyou cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.\"-- The \r\nmeaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just \r\nexpressed.'\r\n        3. The Master said, 'With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to \r\ntalk\r\n\r\n已矣、告諸往而知來者。\r\n【十六章】子曰、不患人之不己知、患不知人也。\r\nabout the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper \r\nsequence.'\r\n        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'I will not be afflicted at \r\nmen's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know \r\nmen.'\r\n\r\n\r\n為政第二\r\nBOOK II. WEI CHANG.\r\n\r\n【第一章】子曰、為政以德、譬如北辰、居其所、而眾星共之。\r\n        CHAP. I. The Master said, 'He who exercises government \r\nby means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar \r\nstar, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.'\r\n\r\n【第二章】子曰、詩三百、一言以蔽之、曰、思無邪。\r\n【第三章】【一節】子曰、道之以政、齊之以刑、民免而無恥。【二節】道\r\n之以德、齊之以禮、有恥且格。\r\n【第四章】【一節】子曰、吾十有五而志于學。【二節】三十而立。【三節】\r\n四十而不惑。【四節】五\r\n        CHAP. II. The Master said, 'In the Book of Poetry are \r\nthree hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be \r\nembraced in one sentence-- \"Having no depraved thoughts.\"'\r\n        CHAP. III. 1. The Master said, 'If the people be led by \r\nlaws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, \r\nthey will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of \r\nshame.\r\n        2. 'If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be \r\ngiven them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense \r\nof shame, and moreover will become good.'\r\n        CHAP. IV. 1. The Master said, 'At fifteen, I had my mind \r\nbent on learning.\r\n        2. 'At thirty, I stood firm.\r\n        3. 'At forty, I had no doubts.\r\n        4. 'At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.\r\n\r\n十而知天命。【五節】六十而耳順。【五節】七十而從心所欲、不踰矩。\r\n【第五章】【一節】孟懿子問孝、子曰、無違。【二節】樊遲御、子告之曰、\r\n孟孫問孝於我、我對曰、無違。【三節】樊遲曰、何謂也、子曰、生事之以\r\n禮、死葬之以禮、祭之以禮。\r\n        5. 'At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the \r\nreception of truth.\r\n        6. 'At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, \r\nwithout transgressing what was right.'\r\n        CHAP. V. 1. Mang I asked what filial piety was. The \r\nMaster said, 'It is not being disobedient.'\r\n        2. Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master \r\ntold him, saying, 'Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and \r\nI answered him,-- \"not being disobedient.\"'\r\n        3. Fan Ch'ih said, 'What did you mean?' The Master \r\nreplied, 'That parents, when alive, be served according to \r\npropriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to \r\npropriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to \r\npropriety.'\r\n\r\n【第六章】孟武伯問孝、子曰、父母唯其疾之憂。\r\n【第七章】子游問孝、子曰、今之孝者、是謂能養、至於犬馬、皆能有養、\r\n不敬、何以別乎。\r\n【第八章】子夏問孝、子曰、色難、有事、弟子服其勞、有酒食、先生饌、\r\n曾是以為孝乎。\r\n        CHAP. VI. Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The \r\nMaster said, 'Parents are anxious lest their children should be \r\nsick.'\r\n        CHAP. VII. Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The \r\nMaster said, 'The filial piety of now-a-days means the support \r\nof one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do \r\nsomething in the way of support;-- without reverence, what is \r\nthere to distinguish the one support given from the other?'\r\n        CHAP. VIII. Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The \r\nMaster said, 'The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when \r\ntheir elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the \r\ntoil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they \r\nset them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial \r\npiety?'\r\n\r\n【第九章】子曰、吾與回言終日、不違、如愚。退兒省其私、亦足以發、回\r\n也不愚。\r\n【第十章】【一節】子曰、視其所以。【二節】觀其所由。【三節】察其所\r\n安。【四節】人焉廋哉、人焉廋哉。\r\n【十一章】子曰、溫故而知新、可以為師矣。\r\n        CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'I have talked with Hui for a \r\nwhole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I \r\nsaid;-- as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have \r\nexamined his conduct when away from me, and found him able \r\nto illustrate my teachings. Hui!-- He is not stupid.'\r\n        CHAP. X. 1. The Master said, 'See what a man does.\r\n        2. 'Mark his motives.\r\n        3. 'Examine in what things he rests.\r\n        4. 'How can a man conceal his character?\r\n        5. How can a man conceal his character?'\r\n        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'If a man keeps cherishing his \r\nold knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may \r\nbe a teacher of others.'\r\n\r\n【十二章】子曰、君子不器。\r\n【十三章】子貢問君子、子曰、先行其言、而後從之。\r\n【十四章】子曰、君子周而不比、小人比而不周。\r\n【十五章】子曰、學而不思則罔、思而不學則殆。\r\n【十六章】子曰、攻乎異端、斯害也己。\r\n        CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'The accomplished scholar is \r\nnot a utensil.'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. Tsze-kung asked what constituted the \r\nsuperior man. The Master said, 'He acts before he speaks, and \r\nafterwards speaks according to his actions.'\r\n        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'The superior man is catholic \r\nand no partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.'\r\n        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Learning without thought is \r\nlabour lost; thought without learning is perilous.'\r\n        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'The study of strange \r\ndoctrines is injurious indeed!'\r\n\r\n【十七章】子曰、由、誨女知之乎、知之為知之、不知為不知、是知也。\r\n【十八章】【一節】子張學干祿。【一節】子曰、多聞闕疑、慎言其餘、則\r\n寡尤、多見闕殆、慎行其餘、則寡悔、言寡尤、行寡悔、祿在其中矣。\r\n        CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'Yu, shall I teach you what \r\nknowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know \r\nit; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not \r\nknow it;-- this is knowledge.'\r\n        CHAP. XVII. 1. Tsze-chang was learning with a view to \r\nofficial emolument.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'Hear much and put aside the points \r\nof which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the \r\nsame time of the others:-- then you will afford few occasions \r\nfor blame. See much and put aside the things which seem \r\nperilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying \r\nthe others into practice:-- then you will have few occasions for \r\nrepentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his \r\nwords, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in \r\nthe way to get emolument.'\r\n\r\n【十九章】哀公聞曰、何為則民服。孔子對曰、舉直錯諸枉、則民服、舉枉\r\n錯諸直、則民不服。\r\n【二十章】季康子問使民敬忠以勤、如之何。子曰、臨之以莊、則敬、孝慈、\r\n則忠、舉善而教不能、則勤。\r\n【廿一章】【一節】或謂孔子曰、子奚\r\n        CHAP. XIX. The Duke Ai asked, saying, 'What should be \r\ndone in order to secure the submission of the people?' \r\nConfucius replied, 'Advance the upright and set aside the \r\ncrooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and \r\nset aside the upright, then the people will not submit.'\r\n        CHAP. XX. Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to \r\nreverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to \r\nnerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, 'Let him preside \r\nover them with gravity;-- then they will reverence him. Let \r\nhim be filial and kind to all;-- then they will be faithful to him. \r\nLet him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-- then \r\nthey will eagerly seek to be virtuous.'\r\n        CHAP. XXI. 1. Some one addressed Confucius, saying, 'Sir, \r\nwhy are you not engaged in the government?'\r\n\r\n不為政。【二節】子曰、書云孝乎、惟孝友于兄弟、施於有政、是亦為政、\r\n奚其為為政。\r\n【廿二章】子曰、人而無信、不知其可也、大車無輗、小車無軏、其何以行\r\n之哉。\r\n【廿三章】【一節】子張問十世、可知也。【二節】子曰、殷因於夏禮、\r\n        2. The Master said, 'What does the Shu-ching say of filial \r\npiety?-- \"You are filial, you discharge your brotherly duties. \r\nThese qualities are displayed in government.\" This then also \r\nconstitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be \r\nTHAT-- making one be in the government?'\r\n        CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'I do not know how a man \r\nwithout truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be \r\nmade to go without the cross-bar for yoking the oxen to, or a \r\nsmall carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?'\r\n        CHAP. XXIII. 1. Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of \r\nten ages after could be known.\r\n        2. Confucius said, 'The Yin dynasty followed the \r\nregulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them \r\nmay be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations \r\nof Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. \r\nSome other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the \r\ndistance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.'\r\n\r\n所損益、可知也、周因於殷禮、所損益、可知也、其或繼周者、雖百世、可\r\n知也。\r\n【廿四章】【一節】子曰、非其鬼而祭之、諂也。【二節】見義不為、無勇\r\n也。\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. 1. The Master said, 'For a man to sacrifice to \r\na spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.\r\n        2. 'To see what is right and not to do it is want of \r\ncourage.'\r\n\r\n八佾第三\r\nBOOK III. PA YIH.\r\n\r\n【第一章】孔子謂季氏、八佾舞於庭、是可忍也、孰不可忍也。\r\n        CHAP. I. Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who \r\nhad eight rows of pantomimes in his area, 'If he can bear to do \r\nthis, what may he not bear to do?'\r\n\r\n【第二章】三家者、以雍徹。子曰、相維辟公、天子穆穆、奚取於三家之堂。\r\n【第三章】子曰、人而不仁、如禮何、人而不仁、如樂何。\r\n【第四章】【一節】林放問禮之本。【二節】子曰、大哉問。【三節】禮、\r\n與其奢也、寧\r\n        CHAP. II. The three families used the YUNG ode, while the \r\nvessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. \r\nThe Master said, '\"Assisting are the princes;-- the son of heaven \r\nlooks profound and grave:\"-- what application can these words \r\nhave in the hall of the three families?'\r\n        CHAP. III. The Master said, 'If a man be without the \r\nvirtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of \r\npropriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, \r\nwhat has he to do with music?'\r\n        CHAP. IV. 1. Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be \r\nattended to in ceremonies.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'A great question indeed!\r\n        3. 'In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than \r\nextravagant.\r\n\r\n儉、喪、與其易也、寧戚。\r\n【第五章】子曰、夷狄之有君、不如諸夏之亡也。\r\n【第六章】季氏旅於泰山。子謂冉有曰、女弗能救與。對曰、不能。子曰、\r\n嗚呼、曾謂泰山、不如林放乎。\r\nIn the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep \r\nsorrow than a minute attention to observances.'\r\n        CHAP. V. The Master said, 'The rude tribes of the east and \r\nnorth have their princes, and are not like the States of our \r\ngreat land which are without them.'\r\n        CHAP. VI. The chief of the Chi family was about to \r\nsacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, 'Can \r\nyou not save him from this?' He answered, 'I cannot.' Confucius \r\nsaid, 'Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so \r\ndiscerning as Lin Fang?'\r\n\r\n【第七章】子曰、君子無所爭、必也射乎、揖讓而升、下而飲、其爭也君子。\r\n【第八章】子夏問曰、巧笑倩兮、美目盼兮、素以為絢兮。何為也。【二節】\r\n子曰、繪事後素。【三節】曰、禮後乎。子曰、起予者商也、始可與言詩已\r\n矣。\r\n        CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'The student of virtue has no \r\ncontentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in \r\narchery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he \r\nascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In \r\nhis contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.'\r\n        CHAP. VIII. 1. Tsze-hsia asked, saying, 'What is the \r\nmeaning of the passage-- \"The pretty dimples of her artful \r\nsmile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain \r\nground for the colours?\"'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'The business of laying on the colours \r\nfollows (the preparation of) the plain ground.'\r\n        3. 'Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?' The Master \r\nsaid, 'It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can \r\nbegin to talk about the odes with him.'\r\n\r\n【第九章】子曰、夏禮吾能言之、杞不足徵也、殷禮吾能言之、宋不足徵也、\r\n文獻不足故也、足、則吾能徵之矣。\r\n【第十章】子曰、禘、自既灌而往者、吾不欲觀之矣。\r\n【十一章】或問禘之說。子曰、不知也、知其說者、之於天下也、其如示諸\r\n        CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'I could describe the \r\nceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently \r\nattest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin \r\ndynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. (They \r\ncannot do so) because of the insufficiency of their records and \r\nwise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in \r\nsupport of my words.'\r\n        CHAP. X.

'Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to \r\nvirtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be \r\ninsufficient.\r\n        3.

XVIII. The Master said, 'In serving his parents, a \r\nson may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that \r\nthey do not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased \r\ndegree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and \r\nshould they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur.'\r\n\r\n不違、勞而不怨。\r\n【十九章】子曰、父母在、不遠游、游必有方。\r\n【二十章】子曰、三年無改於父之道、可謂孝矣。\r\n【廿一章】子曰、父母之年、不可不知也、一則以喜、一則以懼。\r\n【廿二章】子曰、古者言之不出、恥躬之不逮也。\r\n【廿三章】子曰、以約、失之者鮮矣。\r\n        CHAP.

The Master said, 'The reason why the \r\nancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that \r\nthey feared lest their actions should not come up to them.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIII.

Some one said, 'Yung is truly virtuous, but he \r\nis not ready with his tongue.'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'What is the good of being ready with \r\nthe tongue? They who encounter men with smartnesses of \r\nspeech for the most part procure themselves hatred.

Now \r\nmy way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is \r\nfrom Yu that I have learned to make this change.'\r\n\r\n聽其言而觀其行、於予與改是。\r\n【第十章】子曰、吾未見剛者。或對曰、申棖。子曰、棖也慾、焉得剛。\r\n【十一章】子貢曰、我不欲人之加諸我也、吾亦欲無加諸人。子曰、賜也、\r\n非爾所及也。\r\n【十二章】子貢曰、夫子之文章、\r\n        CHAP.

On all these he frequently discoursed.\r\n\r\n【十八章】【一節】葉公問孔子於子路、子路不對。【二節】子曰、女奚不\r\n曰、其為人也、發憤忘食、樂以忘憂、不知老之將至云爾。\r\n【十九章】子曰、我非生而知之者、好古、敏以求之者也。\r\n【二十章】子不語、怪、力、亂、神。\r\n        CHAP. XVIII. 1. The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about \r\nConfucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'Why did you not say to him,-- He is \r\nsimply a man, who in his eager pursuit (of knowledge) forgets \r\nhis food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, \r\nand who does not perceive that old age is coming on?'\r\n        CHAP. XIX. The Master said, 'I am not one who was born \r\nin the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of \r\nantiquity, and earnest in seeking it there.'\r\n        CHAP. XX. The subjects on which the Master did not talk, \r\nwere-- extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and \r\nspiritual beings.\r\n\r\n【廿一章】子曰、三人行、必有我師焉、擇其善者而從之、其不善者而改之。\r\n【廿二章】子曰、天生德於予、桓魋其如予何。\r\n【廿三章】子曰、二三子、以我為隱乎、吾無隱乎爾、吾無行而不與二三子\r\n者、是丘也、\r\n【廿四章】子以四教、文、行、忠、信。\r\n        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'When I walk along with two \r\nothers, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their \r\ngood qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid \r\nthem.'\r\n        CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'Heaven produced the virtue \r\nthat is in me. Hwan T'ui-- what can he do to me?'\r\n        CHAP. XXIII. The Master said, 'Do you think, my disciples, \r\nthat I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. \r\nThere is nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my \r\ndisciples;-- that is my way.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. There were four things which the Master \r\ntaught,-- letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.\r\n\r\n【廿五章】【一節】子曰、聖人吾不得而見之矣、得見君子者、斯可矣。【二\r\n節】子曰、善人吾不得而見之矣、得見有恆者、斯可矣。【三節】亡而為有、\r\n虛而為盈、約而為泰、難乎有恆矣。\r\n【廿六章】子釣而不綱、弋不射宿。\r\n【廿七章】子曰、蓋有不知而作\r\n        CHAP. XXV. 1. The Master said, 'A sage it is not mine to \r\nsee; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would \r\nsatisfy me.'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'A good man it is not mine to see; \r\ncould I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy \r\nme.\r\n        3. 'Having not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet \r\naffecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at ease:-- \r\nit is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVI. The Master angled,-- but did not use a net. \r\nHe shot,-- but not at birds perching.\r\n        CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'There may be those who \r\nact without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and \r\nselecting what is good and following it; seeing much and \r\nkeeping it in memory:-- this is the second style of knowledge.'\r\n\r\n之者、我無是也。多聞、擇其善者而從之、多見而識之、知之次也。\r\n【廿八章】【一節】互鄉難與言、童子見、門人惑。【二節】子曰、與其進\r\n也、不與其退也、唯何甚、人潔己以進、與其潔也、不保其往也。\r\n子曰、仁遠乎哉、我欲仁、斯仁至矣。\r\n【三十章】【一節】陳司敗問昭公知禮乎。孔子曰、知禮。孔子退、揖巫馬\r\n期而進\r\n        CHAP. XXVIII. 1. It was difficult to talk (profitably and \r\nreputably) with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place \r\nhaving had an interview with the Master, the disciples \r\ndoubted.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'I admit people's approach to me \r\nwithout committing myself as to what they may do when they \r\nhave retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify \r\nhimself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without \r\nguaranteeing his past conduct.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIX. The Master said, 'Is virtue a thing remote? I \r\nwish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.'\r\n        CHAP. XXX. 1. The minister of crime of Ch'an asked \r\nwhether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, 'He \r\nknew propriety.'\r\n        2. Confucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-\r\nma Ch'i\r\n\r\n之、曰、吾聞君子不黨、君子亦黨乎、君取於吳為同姓、謂之吳孟子、君而\r\n知禮、孰不知禮。【三節】 巫馬期以告。子曰、丘也幸、苟有過、人必知\r\n之。\r\n【卅一章】子與人歌、而善、必使反之、而後和之。\r\n【卅二章】子曰、文、莫吾猶人\r\nto come forward, and said, 'I have heard that the superior man \r\nis not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The \r\nprince married a daughter of the house of Wu, of the same \r\nsurname with himself, and called her,-- \"The elder Tsze of Wu.\" \r\nIf the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?'\r\n        3. Wu-ma Ch'i reported these remarks, and the Master \r\nsaid, 'I am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure to \r\nknow them.'\r\n        CHAP. XXXI. When the Master was in company with a \r\nperson who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him \r\nrepeat the song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.\r\n        CHAP. XXXII. The Master said, 'In letters I am perhaps \r\nequal to other men, but the character of the superior man, \r\ncarrying out in his conduct what he professes, is what I have \r\nnot yet attained to.'\r\n\r\n也、躬行君子、則吾未之有得。\r\n【卅三章】子曰、若聖與仁、則吾豈敢、抑為之不厭、誨人不倦、則可謂云\r\n爾已矣。公西華曰、正唯弟子不能學也。\r\n【卅四章】子疾病。子路請禱。子曰、有諸。子路對曰、有之、誄曰、禱爾\r\n於上下神\r\n祗 。子曰、丘之禱久矣。\r\n        CHAP. XXXIII. The Master said, 'The sage and the man of \r\nperfect virtue;-- how dare I rank myself with them? It may \r\nsimply be said of me, that I strive to become such without \r\nsatiety, and teach others without weariness.' Kung-hsi Hwa \r\nsaid, 'This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.'\r\n        CHAP. XXXIV. The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked \r\nleave to pray for him. He said, 'May such a thing be done?' \r\nTsze-lu replied, 'It may. In the Eulogies it is said, \"Prayer has \r\nbeen made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower \r\nworlds.\"' The Master said, 'My praying has been for a long \r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n【卅五章】子曰、奢則不孫、儉則固、與其不孫也、寧固。\r\n【卅六章】子曰、君子坦蕩蕩、小人長戚戚。\r\n【卅七章】子溫而厲、威而不猛、恭而安。\r\n        CHAP. XXXV. The Master said, 'Extravagance leads to \r\ninsubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be \r\nmean than to be insubordinate.'\r\n        CHAP. XXXVI. The Master said, 'The superior man is \r\nsatisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of \r\ndistress.'\r\n        CHAP. XXXVII. The Master was mild, and yet dignified; \r\nmajestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.\r\n\r\n泰伯第八\r\nBOOK VIII. T'AI-PO.\r\n\r\n【第一章】子曰、太伯其可謂至德也已矣、三以天下讓、民無得而稱焉。\r\n        CHAP. I. The Master said, 'T'ai-po may be said to have \r\nreached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined \r\nthe kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could \r\nnot express their approbation of his conduct.'\r\n\r\n【第二章】【一節】子曰、恭而無禮則勞、慎而無禮則葸、勇而無禮則亂、\r\n直而無禮則絞。【二節】君子篤於親、則民興於仁、故舊不遺、則民不偷。\r\n【第三章】曾子有疾、召門弟子曰、啟予\r\n        CHAP. II. 1. The Master said, 'Respectfulness, without the \r\nrules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, \r\nwithout the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, \r\nwithout the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination; \r\nstraightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes \r\nrudeness.\r\n        2. 'When those who are in high stations perform well all \r\ntheir duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. \r\nWhen old friends are not neglected by them, the people are \r\npreserved from meanness.'\r\n        CHAP. III. The philosopher Tsang being ill, he called to \r\nhim the disciples of his school, and said, 'Uncover my feet, \r\nuncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"We should \r\nbe apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, \r\nas if treading on thin ice,\" and so have I been.

IV. 1. The philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang \r\nwent to ask how he was.\r\n        2. Tsang said to him, 'When a bird is about to die, its \r\nnotes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are \r\ngood.\r\n        3. 'There are three principles of conduct which the man of \r\nhigh rank should consider specially important:-- that in his \r\ndeportment and manner he keep from violence and \r\nheedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near \r\nto sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from \r\nlowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to \r\nthe sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.'\r\n\r\n【第五章】曾子曰、以能問於不能、以多問於寡、有若無、實若處、犯而不\r\n校、昔者吾友、嘗從事於斯矣。\r\n【第六章】曾子曰、可以託六尺之孤、可以寄百里之命、臨大節、而不可奪\r\n也、君子人與、君子人也。\r\n【第七章】【一節】曾子曰、士、不可以不弘毅、任重而道遠。【二節】仁\r\n以為己\r\n        CHAP. V. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Gifted with ability, \r\nand yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed \r\nof much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; \r\nhaving, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as \r\nempty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; \r\nformerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.'\r\n        CHAP. VI. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Suppose that there \r\nis an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a \r\nyoung orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority \r\nover a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however \r\ngreat can drive from his principles:-- is such a man a superior \r\nman? He is a superior man indeed.'\r\n        CHAP. VII. 1. The philosopher Tsang said, 'The officer \r\nmay not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. \r\nHis burden is heavy and his course is long.\r\n\r\n任、不亦重乎、死而後已、不亦遠乎。\r\n【第八章】【一節】子曰、興於詩。【二節】立於禮。【三節】成於樂。\r\n【第九章】子曰、民可使由之、不可使知之。\r\n【第十章】子曰、好勇疾貧、亂也、人而不仁、疾之已甚、亂也。\r\n        2. 'Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is \r\nhis to sustain;-- is it not heavy? Only with death does his \r\ncourse stop;-- is it not long?\r\n        CHAP. VIII. 1. The Master said, 'It is by the Odes that the \r\nmind is aroused.\r\n        2. 'It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is \r\nestablished.\r\n        3. 'It is from Music that the finish is received.'\r\n        CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'The people may be made to \r\nfollow a path of action, but they may not be made to \r\nunderstand it.'\r\n        CHAP. X. The Master said, 'The man who is fond of daring \r\nand is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to \r\ninsubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you \r\ncarry your dislike of him to an extreme.'\r\n\r\n子曰、如有周公之才之美、使驕且吝、其餘不足觀也已。\r\n【十二章】子曰、三年學、不至於穀、不易得也。\r\n【十三章】【一節】子曰、篤信好學、守死善道。【二節】危邦不入、亂邦\r\n不居、天下有道則見、無道則隱。【三節】邦有道、貧且賤焉、恥也、邦無\r\n道、富且貴焉、恥也。\r\n        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'Though a man have abilities \r\nas admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud \r\nand niggardly, those other things are really not worth being \r\nlooked at.'\r\n        CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'It is not easy to find a man \r\nwho has learned for three years without coming to be good.'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. 1.

'Such an one will not enter a tottering State, nor dwell \r\nin a disorganized one. When right principles of government \r\nprevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are \r\nprostrated, he will keep concealed.\r\n        3. 'When a country is well-governed, poverty and a mean \r\ncondition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill-\r\ngoverned, riches and honour are things to be ashamed of.'\r\n\r\n【十四章】子曰、不在其位、不謀其政。\r\n【十五章】子曰、師摯之始、關睢之亂、洋洋乎盈耳哉。\r\n【十六章】子曰、狂而不直、侗而不愿、悾悾而不信、吾不知之矣。\r\n【十七章】子曰、學如不及、猶恐失之。\r\n【十八章】子曰、巍巍乎、舜禹之\r\n        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'He who is not in any \r\nparticular office, has nothing to do with plans for the \r\nadministration of its duties.'\r\n        CHAP. XV.

XX. 1. Shun had five ministers, and the empire was \r\nwell-governed.\r\n        2. King Wu said, 'I have ten able ministers.'\r\n        3. Confucius said, 'Is not the saying that talents are \r\ndifficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu \r\nmet, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there \r\nwas a woman among them. The able ministers were no more \r\nthan nine men.\r\n\r\n有婦人焉、九人而已【四節】三分天下有其二、以服事殷、周之德、其可謂\r\n至德也已矣。\r\n【廿一章】子曰、禹吾無間然矣、菲飲食、而致孝乎鬼神、惡衣服、而致美\r\n乎黻冕、卑宮室、而盡力乎溝恤、禹吾無間然矣。\r\n        4. 'King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the \r\nempire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The \r\nvirtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the \r\nhighest point indeed.'\r\n        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'I can find no flaw in the \r\ncharacter of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but \r\ndisplayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His \r\nordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost \r\nelegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low mean \r\nhouse, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water-\r\nchannels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.'\r\n\r\n子罕第九\r\nBOOK IX.

His learning is extensive, and \r\nyet he does not render his name famous by any particular \r\nthing.'\r\n        2. The Master heard the observation, and said to his \r\ndisciples, 'What shall I practise? Shall I practise charioteering, \r\nor shall I practise archery? I will practise charioteering.'\r\n\r\n【第三章】【一節】子曰、麻冕、禮也、今也純、儉、吾從眾。【二節】拜\r\n下、禮也。今拜乎上、泰也、雖遠眾、吾從下。\r\n【第四章】子絕四、毋意、毋必、毋固、毋我。\r\n【第五章】【一節】子畏於匡。【二節】曰、文王既沒、文不在茲乎。【三\r\n節】天之將喪斯文也、後死者不得與於斯文也、\r\n        CHAP.

'The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the \r\nhall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That \r\nis arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose \r\nthe common practice.'\r\n        CHAP. IV. There were four things from which the Master \r\nwas entirely free.

'If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, \r\nthen I, a future mortal, should not have got such a relation to \r\nthat cause.

A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, 'May \r\nwe not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his \r\nability!'\r\n        2. Tsze-kung said, 'Certainly Heaven has endowed him \r\nunlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is \r\nvarious.'\r\n        3. The Master heard of the conversation and said, 'Does \r\nthe high officer know me? When I was young, my condition \r\nwas low, and therefore I acquired my ability in many things, \r\nbut they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such \r\nvariety of ability? He does not need variety of ability.'\r\n        4.

The Master said, 'The FANG bird does not \r\ncome; the river sends forth no map:-- it is all over with me!'\r\n        CHAP. IX. When the Master saw a person in a mourning \r\ndress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments \r\nof full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, \r\nthough they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and \r\nif he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily.\r\n\r\n【第十章】【一節】顏淵喟然歎曰、仰之彌高、鑽之彌堅、瞻之在前、忽焉\r\n在後夫子循循然善誘人、博我以文、約我以禮。【三節】欲罷不能、既竭吾\r\n才、如有所立卓爾、雖欲從之、末由也已。\r\n【十一章】【一節】子疾病、子路使門人為臣。【二節】病間曰、久矣哉、\r\n由之行詐也、無臣而為有\r\n        CHAP.

'The Master, by orderly method, skilfully leads men on. \r\nHe enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the \r\nrestraints of propriety.\r\n        3. 'When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I \r\ncannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems \r\nsomething to stand right up before me; but though I wish to \r\nfollow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.'\r\n        CHAP. XI. 1. The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the \r\ndisciples to act as ministers to him.\r\n        2. During a remission of his illness, he said, 'Long has the \r\nconduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers \r\nwhen I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I \r\nimpose upon Heaven?\r\n\r\n臣、吾誰欺、欺天乎。【三節】且予與其死於臣之手也、無寧死於二三子之\r\n手乎、且予縱不得大葬、予死於道路乎。\r\n【十二章】子貢曰、有美玉於斯、韞(du2 匚＋賣、與「櫝」同)而藏諸、求\r\n善賈而沽諸。子曰、沽之哉、沽之哉、我待賈者也。\r\n【十三章】【一節】子欲居九夷。【二節】或曰、陋、如之何。子曰、君子\r\n居之、何陋之有。\r\n【十四章】子曰、吾自衛反魯、然後樂\r\n        3. 'Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of \r\nministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, \r\nmy disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I \r\ndie upon the road?'\r\n        CHAP. XII. Tsze-kung said, 'There is a beautiful gem here. \r\nShould I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a \r\ngood price and sell it?' The Master said, 'Sell it! Sell it! But I \r\nwould wait for one to offer the price.'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. 1. The Master was wishing to go and live \r\namong the nine wild tribes of the east.\r\n        2. Some one said, 'They are rude. How can you do such a \r\nthing?' The Master said, 'If a superior man dwelt among them, \r\nwhat rudeness would there be?'\r\n        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'I returned from Wei to Lu, \r\nand then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal \r\nsongs and Praise songs all found their proper places.'\r\n\r\n正、雅頌各得其所。\r\n【十五章】子曰、出則事公卿、入則事父兄、喪事不敢不勉、不為酒困、何\r\n有於我哉。\r\n【十六章】子在川上曰、逝者如斯夫、不舍晝夜。\r\n【十七章】子曰、吾未見好德、如好色者也。\r\n【十八章】子曰、譬如為山、未成一簣、止、吾止也、譬如平地、雖\r\n        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Abroad, to serve the high \r\nministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder \r\nbrothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's \r\nself; and not to be overcome of wine:-- which one of these \r\nthings do I attain to?'\r\n        CHAP. XVI. The Master standing by a stream, said, 'It \r\npasses on just like this, not ceasing day or night!'\r\n        CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'I have not seen one who \r\nloves virtue as he loves beauty.'\r\n        CHAP. XVIII. The Master said, 'The prosecution of \r\nlearning may be compared to what may happen in raising a \r\nmound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the \r\nwork, and I stop, the\r\n\r\n覆一簣、進、吾往也。\r\n【十九章】子曰、語之而不惰者、其回也與。\r\n【二十章】子謂顏淵曰、惜乎、吾見其進也、未見其止也。\r\n【廿一章】子曰、苗而不秀者、有矣夫、秀而不實者、有矣夫。\r\n【廿二章】子曰、後生可畏、焉知來者之不如今也、四十五十而無聞焉、斯\r\n亦不足畏也已。\r\nstopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing \r\ndown the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful \r\nis thrown at a time, the advancing with it is my own going \r\nforward.'\r\n        CHAP. XIX. The Master said, 'Never flagging when I set \r\nforth anything to him;-- ah! that is Hui.'\r\n        CHAP. XX. The Master said of Yen Yuan, 'Alas! I saw his \r\nconstant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.'\r\n        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'There are cases in which the \r\nblade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are \r\ncases where it flowers, but no fruit is subsequently produced!'\r\n        CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'A youth is to be regarded \r\nwith respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal \r\nto our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not \r\nmade himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being \r\nregarded with respect.'\r\n\r\n【廿三章】子曰、法語之言、能無從乎、改之為貴、巽與之言、能無說乎、\r\n繹之為貴、說而不繹、從而不改、吾末如之何也已矣。\r\n【廿四章】子曰、主忠信、毋友不如己者、過則勿憚改。\r\n【廿五章】子曰、三軍可奪師也、匹夫不可奪志也。\r\n        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'Can men refuse to assent to \r\nthe words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct \r\nbecause of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be \r\npleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their \r\naim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, \r\nbut does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does \r\nnot reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. The Master said, 'Hold faithfulness and \r\nsincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to \r\nyourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.'\r\n        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'The commander of the \r\nforces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a \r\ncommon man cannot be taken from him.'\r\n\r\n【廿六章】【一節】子曰、衣敝縕袍、與衣孤貉者立、而不恥者、其由也與。\r\n【二節】不忮不求、何用不臧。【三節】子路終身誦之、子曰、是道也、何\r\n足以臧。\r\n【廿七章】子曰、歲寒、然後知松柏之後彫也。\r\n【廿八章】子曰、知者不惑、仁者不憂、勇者不懼。\r\n【廿九章】子曰、可與共學、未可與\r\n        CHAP. XXVI. 1. The Master said, 'Dressed himself in a \r\ntattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of \r\nmen dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-- ah! it is Yu who is \r\nequal to this!\r\n        2. '\"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-- what can he do \r\nbut what is good!\"'\r\n        3. Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the \r\node, when the Master said, 'Those things are by no means \r\nsufficient to constitute (perfect) excellence.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'When the year becomes \r\ncold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last \r\nto lose their leaves.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVIII. The Master said, 'The wise are free from \r\nperplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIX. The Master said, 'There are some with whom \r\nwe may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go \r\nalong\r\n\r\n適道、可與適道、未可與立、可與立、未可與權。\r\n【三十章】【一節】唐棣之華、偏其反而、豈不爾思、室是遠而。【二節】\r\n子曰、未之思也、未何遠之有。\r\nwith us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to \r\nprinciples, but we shall find them unable to get established in \r\nthose along with us. Or if we may get so established along with \r\nthem, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events \r\nalong with us.'\r\n        CHAP. XXX. 1. How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter \r\nand turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\r\n        2.

Confucius, in his village, looked simple and \r\nsincere, and as if he were not able to speak.\r\n        2. When he was in the prince's ancestorial temple, or in \r\nthe court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.\r\n        CHAP II. 1. When he was waiting at court, in speaking \r\nwith the great officers of the lower grade, he spake freely, but \r\nin a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the \r\nhigher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.\r\n        2. When the ruler was present, his manner displayed \r\nrespectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.\r\n\r\n【第三章】【一節】 君召使擯、色勃如也、足躩如也。【二節】揖所與立、\r\n左右手、衣前後、檐如也。【三節】趨進、翼如也。【四節】賓退、必復命\r\n曰、賓不顧矣。\r\n【第四章】【一節】入公門、鞠\r\n        CHAP. III. 1. When the prince called him to employ him \r\nin the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to \r\nchange, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.\r\n        2. He inclined himself to the other officers among whom \r\nhe stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position \r\nrequired, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind \r\nevenly adjusted.\r\n        3. He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a \r\nbird.\r\n        4. When the guest had retired, he would report to the \r\nprince, 'The visitor is not turning round any more.'\r\n        CHAP. IV. 1.

When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, \r\nhis countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under \r\nhim, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter \r\nthem.\r\n        4. He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe \r\nwith both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath \r\nalso, as if he dared not breathe.\r\n        5. When he came out from the audience, as soon as he \r\nhad descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and \r\nhad a satisfied look. When he had got to the bottom of the \r\nsteps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like \r\nwings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful \r\nuneasiness.\r\n        CHAP. V. 1. When he was carrying the scepter of his \r\nruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to \r\nbear its weight.

I would not walk on \r\nfoot to get a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear \r\nof the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on \r\nfoot.'\r\n        CHAP. VIII. When Yen Yuan died, the Master said, 'Alas! \r\nHeaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!'\r\n\r\n【第九章】【一節】顏淵死、子哭之慟、從者曰、子慟矣。【二節】曰、有\r\n慟乎。【三節】非夫人之為慟而誰為。\r\n【第十章】【一節】顏淵死、門人欲厚葬之。子曰、不可。【二節】門人厚\r\n葬之。【三節】子曰、回也、視予猶父也、予不得視猶子也、非我也、夫二\r\n三子也。\r\n【十一章】李路問事鬼神。子曰、未能事人、焉能事鬼。敢\r\n        CHAP. IX. 1. When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed \r\nhim exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \r\n'Master, your grief is excessive?'\r\n        2. 'Is it excessive?' said he.\r\n        3. 'If I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom \r\nshould I mourn?'\r\n        CHAP. X. 1. When Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to \r\ngive him a great funeral, and the Master said, 'You may not do \r\nso.'\r\n        2. The disciples did bury him in great style.\r\n        3. The Master said, 'Hui behaved towards me as his \r\nfather. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is \r\nnot mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.'\r\n        CHAP. XI. Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the \r\ndead. The Master said, 'While you are not able to serve men, \r\nhow can you serve their spirits?' Chi Lu added, 'I venture to \r\nask about\r\n\r\n問死。曰、未知生、焉知死。\r\n【十二章】【一節】閔子侍側、誾誾如也、子路行行如也、冉有、子貢、侃\r\n侃如也。子樂。【二節】若由也、不得其死然。\r\n【十三章】【一節】魯人為長府。【二節】閔子騫曰、仍舊貫、如之何、何\r\n必改作。【三節】子曰、夫人不言、言必有中。\r\ndeath?' He was answered, 'While you do not know life, how can \r\nyou know about death?'\r\n        CHAP. XII. 1. The disciple Min was standing by his side, \r\nlooking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; \r\nZan Yu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. \r\nThe Master was pleased.\r\n        2. He said, 'Yu, there!-- he will not die a natural death.'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. 1. Some parties in Lu were going to take \r\ndown and rebuild the Long Treasury.\r\n        2. Min Tsze-ch'ien said, 'Suppose it were to be repaired \r\nafter its old style;-- why must it be altered and made anew?'\r\n        3. The Master said, 'This man seldom speaks; when he \r\ndoes, he is sure to hit the point.'\r\n\r\n【十四章】【一節】子曰、由之瑟、奚為於丘之門。【二節】門人不敬子路。\r\n子曰、由也、升堂矣、未入於室也。\r\n【十五章】【一節】子貢問師與商也孰賢。子曰、師也過、商也不及。【二\r\n節】曰、然則師愈與。【三節】子曰、過猶不及。\r\n【十六章】【一節】李氏富於周公、而求也為之聚斂而附\r\n        CHAP. XIV. 1. The Master said, 'What has the lute of Yu to \r\ndo in my door?'\r\n        2. The other disciples began not to respect Tsze-lu. The \r\nMaster said, 'Yu has ascended to the hall, though he has not yet \r\npassed into the inner apartments.'\r\n        CHAP. XV. 1. Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or \r\nShang, was the superior. The Master said, 'Shih goes beyond the \r\ndue mean, and Shang does not come up to it.'\r\n        2. 'Then,' said Tsze-kung, 'the superiority is with Shih, I \r\nsuppose.'\r\n        3. The Master said, 'To go beyond is as wrong as to fall \r\nshort.'\r\n        CHAP. XVI. 1. The head of the Chi family was richer than \r\nthe duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch'iu collected his imposts \r\nfor him, and increased his wealth.\r\n\r\n益之。【二節】子曰、非吾徒也、小子、鳴鼓而攻之可也。\r\n【十七章】【一節】柴也愚。【二節】參也魯。【三節】師也辟。【四節】\r\n由也喭。\r\n【十八章】【一節】子曰、回也奇庶乎屢空。【二節】賜不受命、而貨殖焉、\r\n億則屢中。\r\n【十九章】子張問善人之\r\n        2.

Shih is specious.\r\n        4. Yu is coarse.\r\n        CHAP. XVIII. 1. The Master said, 'There is Hui! He has \r\nnearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.\r\n        2. 'Ts'ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of \r\nHeaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judgments \r\nare often correct.'\r\n        CHAP. XIX. Tsze-chang asked what were the \r\ncharacteristics of\r\n\r\n道。子曰、不踐(ji1、迂+亦、與跡同)、亦不入於室。\r\n【二十章】子曰、論篤是與、君子者乎、色莊者乎。\r\n【廿一章】子路問聞斯行諸。子曰、有父兄在、如之何其聞斯行之。冉有問\r\n聞斯行諸。子曰、聞斯行之。公西華曰、由也問聞斯行諸、子曰、有父兄在、\r\n求也\r\nthe GOOD man. The Master said, 'He does not tread in the \r\nfootsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the \r\nchamber of the sage.'\r\n        CHAP. XX. The Master said, 'If, because a man's discourse \r\nappears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he \r\nreally a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?'\r\n        CHAP. XXI. Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately \r\ncarry into practice what he heard. The Master said, 'There are \r\nyour father and elder brothers to be consulted;-- why should \r\nyou act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice \r\nwhat you hear?' Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should \r\nimmediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master \r\nanswered, 'Immediately carry into practice what you hear.' \r\nKung-hsi Hwa said, 'Yu asked whether he should carry \r\nimmediately into practice what he heard, and you said, \"There \r\nare your father and elder brothers to be consulted.\" Ch'iu asked \r\nwhether he should immediately carry into practice what he \r\nheard, and you said, \"Carry it immediately into practice.\" I, \r\nCh'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.' \r\nThe Master said, 'Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore,\r\n\r\n問聞斯行諸、子曰、聞斯行之、赤也感、敢問。子曰、求也退、故進之、由\r\n也兼人、故退之。\r\n【廿二章】子畏於匡、顏淵後、子曰、吾以女為死矣。曰、子在、回何敢死。\r\n【廿三章】【一節】李子然問仲由冉求、可謂大臣與。【二節】子曰、吾以\r\n子為異之問、曾由與求之問。【三節】所謂大臣者、以道事君、不可則止。\r\n【四節】今由\r\nI urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of \r\nenergy; therefore I kept him back.'\r\n        CHAP. XXII. The Master was put in fear in K'wang and \r\nYen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, 'I \r\nthought you had died.' Hui replied, 'While you were alive, how \r\nshould I presume to die?'\r\n        CHAP. XXIII. 1. Chi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and \r\nZan Ch'iu could be called great ministers.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'I thought you would ask about some \r\nextraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu and Ch'iu!\r\n        3. 'What is called a great minister, is one who serves his \r\nprince according to what is right, and when he finds he cannot \r\ndo so, retires.\r\n\r\n與求也、可謂具臣矣。【五節】曰、然則從之者與。【六節】子曰、弒父與\r\n君、亦不從也。\r\n【廿四章】【一節】子路使子羔為費宰。【二節】子曰、賊夫人之子。【三\r\n節】子路曰、有民人焉、有社稷焉、何必讀書、然後為學。【四節】子曰、\r\n是故惡夫佞者。\r\n【廿五章】【一節】子路、曾(上析、下日、與晰同)、冉有、公西華、侍坐。\r\n【二節】子曰、以吾一日\r\n        4.

The Master said, 'In an act of parricide or regicide, they \r\nwould not follow him.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. 1. Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor \r\nof Pi.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'You are injuring a man's son.'\r\n        3. Tsze-lu said, 'There are (there) common people and \r\nofficers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. \r\nWhy must one read books before he can be considered to have \r\nlearned?'\r\n        4. The Master said, 'It is on this account that I hate your \r\nglib-tongued people.'\r\n        CHAP. XXV. 1. Tsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kung-hsi \r\nHwa were sitting by the Master.\r\n        2. He said to them, 'Though I am a day or so older than \r\nyou, do not think of that.\r\n\r\n長乎爾、毋吾以也。【三節】居則曰、不吾知也、如或知爾、則何以哉。【四\r\n節】子路率爾而對曰、千乘之國、攝乎大國之閒、加之以師旅、因之以饑饉、\r\n由也為之、比及三年、可使有勇、且知方也。夫子哂之。【五節】求、爾何\r\n如。對曰、方六七十、如五六十、求也為之、比及三年、可使足民、如其禮\r\n樂、以\r\n        3. 'From day to day you are saying, \"We are not known.\" \r\nIf some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?'\r\n        4. Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, 'Suppose the case of \r\na State of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between \r\nother large States; let it be suffering from invading armies; and \r\nto this let there be added a famine in corn and in all \r\nvegetables:-- if I were intrusted with the government of it, in \r\nthree years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to \r\nrecognise the rules of righteous conduct.' The Master smiled at \r\nhim.\r\n        5. Turning to Yen Yu, he said, 'Ch'iu, what are your \r\nwishes?' Ch'iu replied, 'Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li \r\nsquare, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government \r\nof it;-- in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound \r\namong the people. As to teaching them the principles of \r\npropriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man \r\nto do that.'\r\n\r\n俟君子。【六節】赤、爾何如。對曰、非曰能之、願學焉、宗廟之事、如會\r\n同、端章甫、願為小相焉。【七節】點、爾何如。鼓瑟希鏗爾、舍瑟而作、\r\n對曰、異乎三子者之撰。子曰、何傷乎、赤各言其志也。曰、莫春者、春服\r\n既成、冠者五六人、童子六七人、浴乎沂、風乎舞雩、詠而歸。夫子喟然歎\r\n曰、吾與\r\n        6. 'What are your wishes, Ch'ih,' said the Master next to \r\nKung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, 'I do not say that my ability \r\nextends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the \r\nservices of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the \r\nprinces with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark \r\nsquare-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small \r\nassistant.'\r\n        7. Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, 'Tien, what are \r\nyour wishes?' Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while \r\nit was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and rose. 'My \r\nwishes,' he said, 'are different from the cherished purposes of \r\nthese three gentlemen.' 'What harm is there in that?' said the \r\nMaster; 'do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.' \r\nTien then said, 'In this, the last month of spring, with the dress \r\nof the season all complete, along with five or six young men \r\nwho have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would \r\nwash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and \r\nreturn home singing.' The Master heaved a sigh and said, 'I \r\ngive my approval to Tien.'\r\n\r\n點也。【八節】三子者出、曾(上析、下日、與晰同)後、曾(上析、下日、\r\n與晰同)曰、夫三子者之言何如。子曰、亦各言其志也已矣。【九節】曰、\r\n夫子何哂由也。【十節】曰、為國以禮、其言不讓、是故哂之。【十一節】\r\n唯求則非邦也與。安見方六七十、如五六十、而非邦也者。【十二節】唯赤\r\n則非邦也與。宗廟會同、非諸侯而何、赤也為之小、孰能為之大。\r\n        8. The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained \r\nbehind, and said, 'What do you think of the words of these \r\nthree friends?' The Master replied, 'They simply told each one \r\nhis wishes.'\r\n        9. Hsi pursued, 'Master, why did you smile at Yu?'\r\n        10. He was answered, 'The management of a State \r\ndemands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; \r\ntherefore I smiled at him.'\r\n        11. Hsi again said, 'But was it not a State which Ch'iu \r\nproposed for himself?' The reply was, 'Yes; did you ever see a \r\nterritory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which \r\nwas not a State?'\r\n        12. Once more, Hsi inquired, 'And was it not a State which \r\nCh'ih proposed for himself?' The Master again replied, 'Yes; who \r\nbut princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with \r\naudiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small \r\nassistant in these services, who could be a great one?\r\n\r\n顏淵第十二\r\nBOOK XII. YEN YUAN.\r\n\r\n【第一章】【一節】顏淵問仁。子曰、克己復禮為仁、一日克己復禮、天下\r\n歸仁焉、為仁由己、而由人乎哉。【二節】顏淵曰、請問其目。子曰、非禮\r\n勿視、非禮勿聽、非禮勿言、非禮勿動。顏淵曰、回雖不敏、請事斯語矣。\r\n        CHAP. I. 1. Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The \r\nMaster said, 'To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is \r\nperfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and \r\nreturn to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue \r\nto him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or \r\nis it from others?'\r\n        2. Yen Yuan said, 'I beg to ask the steps of that process.' \r\nThe Master replied, 'Look not at what is contrary to propriety; \r\nlisten not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is \r\ncontrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to \r\npropriety.' Yen Yuan then said, 'Though I am deficient in \r\nintelligence and vigour, I will make it my business to practise \r\nthis lesson.'\r\n\r\n【第二章】仲弓問仁。子曰、出門如見大賓、使民如承大祭、己所不欲、勿\r\n施於人、在邦無怨、在家無怨。仲弓曰、雍雖不敏、請事斯語矣。\r\n【第三章】【一節】司馬牛問仁。【二節】子曰、仁者其言\r\n        CHAP. II. Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The \r\nMaster said, 'It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one \r\nas if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as \r\nif you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as \r\nyou would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring \r\nagainst you in the country, and none in the family.' Chung-kung \r\nsaid, 'Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigour, I will \r\nmake it my business to practise this lesson.'\r\n        CHAP. III. 1. Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'The man of perfect virtue is cautious \r\nand slow in his speech.'\r\n\r\n也訒。【三節】曰、其言也訒、斯謂之仁矣乎。子曰、為之難、言之得無訒\r\n乎。\r\n【第四章】【一節】司馬牛問君子。子曰、君子不憂不懼。【二節】曰、不\r\n憂不懼、斯謂之君子矣乎。【三節】子曰、內省不疚、夫何憂何懼。\r\n【第五章】【一節】司馬牛憂曰、人皆有兄弟、我獨亡。【二節】子夏\r\n        3. 'Cautious and slow in his speech!' said Niu;-- 'is this \r\nwhat is meant by perfect virtue?' The Master said, 'When a \r\nman feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious \r\nand slow in speaking?'\r\n        CHAP. IV. 1. Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. \r\nThe Master said, 'The superior man has neither anxiety nor \r\nfear.'\r\n        2. 'Being without anxiety or fear!' said Nui;-- 'does this \r\nconstitute what we call the superior man?'\r\n        3. The Master said, 'When internal examination discovers \r\nnothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there \r\nto fear?'\r\n        CHAP. V. 1. Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, 'Other men \r\nall have their brothers, I only have not.'\r\n        2. Tsze-hsia said to him, 'There is the following saying \r\nwhich I have heard:--\r\n\r\n曰、商聞之矣。【三節】死生有命、富貴在天。【四節】君子敬而無失、與\r\n人恭而有禮、四海之內、皆兄弟也、君子何患乎無兄弟也。\r\n【第六章】子張問明。子曰、浸潤之譖、膚受之愬、不行焉、可謂明也已矣、\r\n浸潤之譖、膚受之愬、不行焉、可謂遠也已矣。\r\n        3.

'Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order \r\nhis own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and \r\nobservant of propriety:-- then all within the four seas will be \r\nhis brothers. What has the superior man to do with being \r\ndistressed because he has no brothers?'\r\n        CHAP. VI. Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. \r\nThe Master said, 'He with whom neither slander that gradually \r\nsoaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in \r\nthe flesh, are successful, may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, \r\nhe with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling \r\nstatements, are successful, may be called farseeing.'\r\n\r\n【第七章】【一節】子貢問政。子曰足食、足兵、民信之矣。【二節】子貢\r\n曰、必不得已而去、於斯三者何先。曰、去兵。子貢曰、必不得已而去、於\r\n斯二者何先。曰、去食、自古皆有死、民無信不立。\r\n【第八章】【一節】棘子成曰、君子質而已矣、何以文為。【二節】子\r\n        CHAP. VII. 1. Tsze-kung asked about government. The \r\nMaster said, 'The requisites of government are that there be \r\nsufficiency of food, sufficiency of military equipment, and the \r\nconfidence of the people in their ruler.'\r\n        2. Tsze-kung said, 'If it cannot be helped, and one of \r\nthese must be dispensed with, which of the three should be \r\nforegone first?' 'The military equipment,' said the Master.\r\n        3. Tsze-kung again asked, 'If it cannot be helped, and one \r\nof the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them \r\nshould be foregone?' The Master answered, 'Part with the food. \r\nFrom of old, death has been the lot of all men; but if the people \r\nhave no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.'\r\n        CHAP. VIII. 1. Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, 'In a superior man it \r\nis only the substantial qualities which are wanted;-- why \r\nshould we seek for ornamental accomplishments?'\r\n\r\n貢曰、惜乎夫子之說、君子也、駟不及舌。【三節】文猶質也、質猶文也、\r\n虎豹之(kuo4, 革+享、與鞹同)、猶犬羊之(kuo4, 革+享、與鞹同)。\r\n【第九章】【一節】哀公問於有若曰年饑、用不足、如之何。【二節】有若\r\n對曰、盍徹乎。【三節】曰、二、吾猶不足、如之何其徹也。【四節】對曰、\r\n百姓足、君孰與不足、百姓不足、君孰與足。\r\n        2.

Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. \r\nThe hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the \r\nhide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.'\r\n        CHAP. IX. 1. The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, 'The \r\nyear is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not \r\nsufficient;-- what is to be done?'\r\n        2. Yu Zo replied to him, 'Why not simply tithe the \r\npeople?'\r\n        3. 'With two tenths, said the duke, 'I find it not enough;-- \r\nhow could I do with that system of one tenth?'\r\n        4.

X. 1. Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to \r\nbe exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \r\n'Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be \r\nmoving continually to what is right;-- this is the way to exalt \r\none's virtue.\r\n        2. 'You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and \r\nwish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him \r\nto die. This is a case of delusion.\r\n        3. '\"It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you \r\ncome to make a difference.\"'\r\n        CHAP. XI. 1. The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius \r\nabout government.\r\n        2. Confucius replied, 'There is government, when the \r\nprince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father \r\nis father, and the son is son.'\r\n        3. 'Good!' said the duke; 'if, indeed; the prince be not \r\nprince, the minister not minister, the father not father, and the \r\nson not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?'\r\n\r\n【十二章】【一節】子曰、片言可以折獄者、其由也與。【二節】子路無宿\r\n諾。\r\n【十三章】子曰、聽訟、吾猶人也、必也、使無訟乎。\r\n【十四章】子張問政。子曰、居之無倦、行之以忠。\r\n【十五章】子曰、博學於文、約之以禮、亦可以弗畔矣夫。\r\n        CHAP.

The Master said, 'In hearing litigations, I am \r\nlike any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause \r\nthe people to have no litigations.'\r\n        CHAP. XIV. Tsze-chang asked about government. The \r\nMaster said, 'The art of governing is to keep its affairs before \r\nthe mind without weariness, and to practise them with \r\nundeviating consistency.'\r\n        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'By extensively studying all \r\nlearning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules \r\nof propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.'\r\n\r\n【十六章】子曰、君子成人之美、不成人之惡、小人反是。\r\n【十七章】李康子問政於孔子。孔子對曰、政者正也、子帥以正、孰敢不正。\r\n李康子患盜、問於孔子。孔子對曰、苟子之不欲、雖賞之不竊。\r\n【十九章】李康子問政於孔子、曰、如殺無道、以就有道、何如。\r\n        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'The superior man seeks to \r\nperfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to \r\nperfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of \r\nthis.'\r\n        CHAP. XVII. Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. \r\nConfucius replied, 'To govern means to rectify. If you lead on \r\nthe people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?'\r\n        CHAP. XVIII. Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of \r\nthieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with \r\nthem. Confucius said, 'If you, sir, were not covetous, although \r\nyou should reward them to do it, they would not steal.'\r\n        CHAP. XIX. Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, \r\nsaying, 'What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the \r\ngood of the principled?' Confucius replied, 'Sir, in carrying on \r\nyour government, why should you use killing at all? Let your \r\nevinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be \r\ngood.

The Master said, 'What is it you call being \r\ndistinguished?'\r\n        3. Tsze-chang replied, 'It is to be heard of through the \r\nState, to be heard of throughout his clan.'\r\n        4. The Master said, 'That is notoriety, not distinction.\r\n        5. 'Now the man of distinction is solid and \r\nstraightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's \r\nwords, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble \r\nhimself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the \r\ncountry; he will be distinguished in his clan.\r\n        6.

Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under \r\nthe trees about the rain altars, said, 'I venture to ask how to \r\nexalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover \r\ndelusions.'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'Truly a good question!\r\n        3. 'If doing what is to be done be made the first business, \r\nand success a secondary consideration;-- is not this the way to \r\nexalt virtue? To assail one's own wickedness and not assail that \r\nof others;-- is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a \r\nmorning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of \r\nhis parents;-- is not this a case of delusion?'\r\n        CHAP. XXII. 1. Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence.

The Master said, 'Employ the upright and put aside all \r\nthe crooked;-- in this way the crooked can be made to be \r\nupright.'\r\n        4. Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \r\n'A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and \r\nasked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and \r\nput aside all the crooked;-- in this way, the crooked will be \r\nmade to be upright.' What did he mean?'\r\n        5. Tsze-hsia said, 'Truly rich is his saying!\r\n        6. 'Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected \r\nfrom among all the people, and employed Kao-yao, on which all \r\nwho were devoid of virtue disappeared.

He requested further instruction, and was answered, \r\n'Be not weary (in these things).'\r\n        CHAP. II. 1. Chung-kung, being chief minister to the Head \r\nof the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said, \r\n'Employ\r\n\r\n宰、問政。子曰、先有司、赦小過、舉賢才。【二節】曰、焉知賢才而舉之。\r\n曰、舉爾所知、爾所不知、人其舍諸。\r\n【第三章】【一節】子路曰、衛君待子而為政、子將奚先。【二節】子曰、\r\n必也、正名乎。【三節】子路曰、有是哉、子之迂也、奚其正。【四節】子\r\n曰、野哉、由也、君子於其所不知、蓋闕如也。【五節】名不\r\nfirst the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, \r\nand raise to office men of virtue and talents.'\r\n        2. Chung-kung said, 'How shall I know the men of virtue \r\nand talent, so that I may raise them to office?' He was \r\nanswered, 'Raise to office those whom you know. As to those \r\nwhom you do not know, will others neglect them?'\r\n        CHAP. III. 1. Tsze-lu said, 'The ruler of Wei has been \r\nwaiting for you, in order with you to administer the \r\ngovernment. What will you consider the first thing to be done?'\r\n        2. The Master replied, 'What is necessary is to rectify \r\nnames.'\r\n        3. 'So, indeed!' said Tsze-lu. 'You are wide of the mark! \r\nWhy must there be such rectification?'\r\n        4. The Master said, 'How uncultivated you are, Yu! A \r\nsuperior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a \r\ncautious reserve.\r\n        5. 'If names be not correct, language is not in accordance \r\nwith\r\n\r\n正、則言不順、言不順、則事不成。【六節】事不成、則禮樂不興、禮樂不\r\n興、則刑罰不中、刑罰不中、則民無所措手足。【七節】故君子名之必可言\r\n也、言之必可行也、君子於其言、無所茍而已矣。\r\n【第四章】【一節】樊遲請學稼。子曰、吾不如老農。請學為圃。曰、\r\nthe truth of things.

'When affairs cannot be carried on to success, \r\nproprieties and music will not flourish. When proprieties and \r\nmusic do not flourish, punishments will not be properly \r\nawarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the \r\npeople do not know how to move hand or foot.\r\n        7. 'Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that \r\nthe names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that \r\nwhat he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the \r\nsuperior man requires, is just that in his words there may be \r\nnothing incorrect.'\r\n        CHAP. IV. 1. Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. \r\nThe Master said, 'I am not so good for that as an old \r\nhusbandman.'

Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, 'A small \r\nman, indeed, is Fan Hsu!\r\n        3. If a superior love propriety, the people will not dare \r\nnot to be reverent.

When the Master went to Wei, Zan Yu acted \r\nas driver of his carriage.\r\n        2. The Master observed, 'How numerous are the people!'\r\n        3. Yu said, 'Since they are thus numerous, what more \r\nshall be done for them?'

'And when they have been enriched, what more shall \r\nbe done?' The Master said, 'Teach them.'\r\n        CHAP. X. The Master said, 'If there were (any of the \r\nprinces) who would employ me, in the course of twelve \r\nmonths, I should have done something considerable. In three \r\nyears, the government would be perfected.'\r\n        CHAP. XI.

He replied, 'We had \r\ngovernment business.' The Master said, 'It must have been \r\nfamily affairs. If there had been government business, though I \r\nam not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.'\r\n        CHAP. XV. 1.

'There is a saying, however, which people have-- \"To \r\nbe a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.\"\r\n        3. 'If a ruler knows this,-- the difficulty of being a \r\nprince,-- may there not be expected from this one sentence the \r\nprosperity of his country?'\r\n        4. The duke then said, 'Is there a single sentence which \r\ncan ruin a country?' Confucius replied, 'Such an effect as that \r\ncannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the \r\nsaying which people have-- \"I have no pleasure in being a \r\nprince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what \r\nI say!\"\r\n        5. 'If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no \r\none oppose them?

The Duke of Sheh asked about government.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'Good government obtains, when those \r\nwho are near are made happy, and those who are far off are \r\nattracted.'\r\n\r\n者來。\r\n【十七章】子夏為莒父宰、問政。子曰、無欲速、無見小利。欲速則不達、\r\n見小利則大事不成。\r\n【十八章】【一節】葉公語孔子曰、吾黨有直躬者、其父攘羊、而子證之。\r\n【二節】孔子曰、吾黨之直者異於是、父為子隱、子為父隱、直在其中矣。\r\n        CHAP. XVII. Tsze-hsia, being governor of Chu-fu, asked \r\nabout government. The Master said, 'Do not be desirous to have \r\nthings done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to \r\nhave things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. \r\nLooking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being \r\naccomplished.'\r\n        CHAP. XVIII. 1. The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, \r\nsaying, 'Among us here there are those who may be styled \r\nupright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, \r\nthey will bear witness to the fact.'\r\n        2. Confucius said, 'Among us, in our part of the country, \r\nthose who are upright are different from this. The father \r\nconceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the \r\nmisconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.'\r\n\r\n【十九章】樊遲問仁。子曰、居處恭、執事敬、與人忠、雖之夷狄、不可棄\r\n也。\r\n【二十章】【一節】子貢問曰、何如斯可謂之士矣。子曰、行己有恥、使於\r\n四方、不辱君命、可謂士矣。【二節】曰、敢問其次。曰、宗族稱孝焉、鄉\r\n黨稱弟焉。【三節】曰、敢問其次。曰、言必信、行必果、硜硜然、小\r\n        CHAP. XIX. Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The \r\nMaster said, 'It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the \r\nmanagement of business, to be reverently attentive; in \r\nintercourse with others, to be strictly sincere. Though a man go \r\namong rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be \r\nneglected.'\r\n        CHAP. XX. 1. Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'What qualities \r\nmust a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The \r\nMaster said, 'He who in his conduct of himself maintains a \r\nsense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace \r\nhis prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.'\r\n        3. Tsze-kung pursued, 'I venture to ask who may be \r\nplaced in the next lower rank?' And he was told, 'He whom the \r\ncircle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow-\r\nvillagers and neighbours pronounce to be fraternal.'\r\n        3. Again the disciple asked, 'I venture to ask about the \r\nclass still next in order.' The Master said, 'They are determined \r\nto be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. \r\nThey are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the \r\nnext class.'\r\n\r\n人哉、抑亦可以為次矣。【四節】曰、今之從政者何如。子曰、噫、斗筲之\r\n人、何足算也。\r\n【廿一章】子曰、不得中行而與之、必也狂狷乎、狂者進取、狷者有所不為\r\n也。\r\n【廿二章】【一節】子曰、南人有言曰、人而無恆、不可以作巫醫、善夫。\r\n【二節】不恆其德、或承之\r\n        4. Tsze-kung finally inquired, 'Of what sort are those of \r\nthe present day, who engage in government?' The Master said \r\n'Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being \r\ntaken into account.'\r\n        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'Since I cannot get men \r\npursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my \r\ninstructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. \r\nThe ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-\r\ndecided will keep themselves from what is wrong.'\r\n        CHAP. XXII. 1. The Master said, 'The people of the south \r\nhave a saying-- \"A man without constancy cannot be either a \r\nwizard or a doctor.\" Good!\r\n        2. 'Inconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with \r\ndisgrace.'\r\n\r\n羞。【三節】子曰、不占而已矣。\r\n【廿三章】子曰、君子和而不同、小人同而不和。\r\n【廿四章】子貢問曰、鄉人皆好之、何如。子曰、未可也。鄉人皆惡之、何\r\n如。子曰、未可也。不如鄉人之善者好之、其不善者惡之。\r\n【廿五章】子曰、君子易事而難說也、說之不以道、不說也、及\r\n        3.

The Master said, 'The superior man is \r\naffable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not \r\naffable.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'What do you say \r\nof a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?' \r\nThe Master replied, 'We may not for that accord our approval \r\nof him.' 'And what do you say of him who is hated by all the \r\npeople of his neighborhood?' The Master said, 'We may not for \r\nthat conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these \r\ncases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad \r\nhate him.'\r\n        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'The superior man is easy to \r\nserve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any \r\nway which is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. \r\nBut in his\r\n\r\n其使人也、器之。小人難事而易說也、說之雖不以道、說也、及其使人也、\r\n求備焉。\r\n【廿六章】子曰、君子泰而不驕、小人驕而不泰。\r\n【廿七章】子曰、剛、毅、木、訥、近仁。\r\n【廿八章】子路問曰、何如斯可謂之士矣。子曰、切切、偲偲、怡怡如也、\r\n可謂士矣、朋友切切偲偲、兄弟怡怡。\r\nemployment of men, he uses them according to their capacity. \r\nThe mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you \r\ntry to please him, though it be in a way which is not accordant \r\nwith right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, \r\nhe wishes them to be equal to everything.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVI. The Master said, 'The superior man has a \r\ndignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without \r\na dignified ease.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'The firm, the enduring, \r\nthe simple, and the modest are near to virtue.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVIII. Tsze-lu asked, saying, 'What qualities must \r\na man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?' The Master \r\nsaid, 'He must be thus,-- earnest, urgent, and bland:-- among \r\nhis friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren, bland.'\r\n\r\n【廿九章】子曰、善人教民七年、亦可以即戎矣。\r\n【三十章】子曰、以不教民戰、是謂棄之。\r\n        CHAP.

The Master \r\nsaid, 'When good government prevails in a state, to be thinking \r\nonly of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be \r\nthinking, in the same way, only of salary;-- this is shameful.'\r\n\r\n【第二章】【一節】克、伐、怨、欲、不行焉、可以為仁矣。【二節】子曰、\r\n可以為難矣、仁則吾不知也。\r\n【第三章】子曰、士而懷居、不足以為士矣。\r\n【第四章】子曰、邦有道、危言危行、邦無道、危行言孫。\r\n【第五章】子曰、有德者、必有言、有言者、不必有德、仁者、必有勇、勇\r\n者、不必有仁。\r\n        CHAP. II. 1. 'When the love of superiority, boasting, \r\nresentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be \r\ndeemed perfect virtue.'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'This may be regarded as the \r\nachievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to \r\nbe deemed perfect virtue.'\r\n        CHAP. III. The Master said, 'The scholar who cherishes \r\nthe love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.'\r\n        CHAP. IV. The Master said, 'When good government \r\nprevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions \r\nthe same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be \r\nlofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.'\r\n        CHAP. V. The Master said, 'The virtuous will be sure to \r\nspeak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not \r\nalways be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but \r\nthose who are bold may not always be men of principle.'\r\n\r\n【第六章】南宮适問於孔子曰、羿善射、奡盪舟、俱不得其死然、禹稷躬稼、\r\n而有天下夫子不答。南宮适出。子曰、君子哉若人、尚德哉若人。\r\n【第七章】子曰、君子而不仁者有矣夫、未有小人而仁者也。\r\n        CHAP. VI. Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to \r\nConfucius, said, 'I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a \r\nboat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural \r\ndeath. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, \r\nand they became possessors of the kingdom.' The Master made \r\nno reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, 'A \r\nsuperior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is \r\nthis!'\r\n        CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'Superior men, and yet not \r\nalways virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has \r\nbeen a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.'\r\n\r\n【第八章】子曰、愛之、能勿勞乎、忠焉、能勿誨乎。\r\n【第九章】子曰、為命、裨諶草創之、世叔討論之、行人子羽修飾之、東里\r\n子產潤色之。\r\n【第十章】【一節】或問子產。子曰、惠人也。【二節】問子西。曰、彼哉\r\n彼哉。【三節】問管仲。曰、人也、奪伯氏駢邑三百、飯疏食、沒齒、\r\n        CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'Can there be love which \r\ndoes not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty \r\nwhich does not lead to the instruction of its object?'\r\n        CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'In preparing the \r\ngovernmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough \r\ndraught; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, \r\nthe manager of Foreign intercourse, then polished the style; \r\nand, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance \r\nand finish.'\r\n        CHAP. X. 1. Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master \r\nsaid, 'He was a kind man.'\r\n        2. He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, 'That man! \r\nThat man!'\r\n        3. He asked about Kwan Chung. 'For him,' said the Master, \r\n'the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from \r\nthe chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring \r\nword, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to \r\neat.'\r\n\r\n無怨言。\r\n【十一章】子曰、貧而無怨、難、富而無驕、易。\r\n【十二章】子曰、孟公綽、為趙魏老則優、不可以為滕薛大夫。\r\n【十三章】【一節】子路問成人。子曰、若臧武仲之知、公綽之不欲、卞莊\r\n子之勇、冉求之藝、文之以禮樂、亦可以為成人矣。【二節】曰、今之成人\r\n者、何必然、見\r\n        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'To be poor without \r\nmurmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.'\r\n        CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'Mang Kung-ch'o is more than \r\nfit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is \r\nnot fit to be great officer to either of the States Tang or Hsieh.'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. 1. Tsze-lu asked what constituted a \r\nCOMPLETE man. The Master said, 'Suppose a man with the \r\nknowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness \r\nof Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied \r\ntalents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the \r\nrules of propriety and music:-- such a one might be reckoned a \r\nCOMPLETE man.'\r\n        2. He then added, 'But what is the necessity for a \r\ncomplete man of the present day to have all these things? The \r\nman, who in the\r\n\r\n利思義、見危授命、久要不忘平生之言、亦可以為成人矣。\r\n【十四章】【一節】子問公叔文子於公明賈曰、信乎、夫子不言不笑、不取\r\n乎。【二節】公明賈對曰、以告者過也。夫子時然後言、人不厭其言、樂然\r\n後笑、人不厭其笑、義然後取、人不厭其取。子曰、其然、豈其然乎。\r\nview of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of \r\ndanger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget \r\nan old agreement however far back it extends:-- such a man \r\nmay be reckoned a COMPLETE man.'\r\n        CHAP. XIV. 1. The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about \r\nKung-shu Wan, saying, 'Is it true that your master speaks not, \r\nlaughs not, and takes not?'\r\n        2. Kung-ming Chia replied, 'This has arisen from the \r\nreporters going beyond the truth.-- My master speaks when it \r\nis the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his \r\nspeaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so \r\nmen do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is \r\nconsistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get \r\ntired of his taking.' The Master said, 'So! But is it so with him?'\r\n\r\n【十五章】子曰、臧武仲、以防求為後於魯、雖曰不要君、吾不信也。\r\n【十六章】子曰、晉文公譎而不正、齊桓公正而不譎。\r\n【十七章】【一節】子路曰、桓公殺公子糾、召忽死之、管仲不死、\r\n        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Tsang Wu-chung, keeping \r\npossession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a \r\nsuccessor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he \r\nwas not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.'\r\n        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'The duke Wan of Tsin was \r\ncrafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and \r\nnot crafty.'\r\n        CHAP. XVII. 1. Tsze-lu said, 'The Duke Hwan caused his \r\nbrother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died with his master, \r\nbut Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting \r\nin virtue?'\r\n\r\n曰、未仁乎。【二節】子曰、桓公九合諸侯、不以兵車、管仲之力也、如其\r\n仁、如其仁。\r\n【十八章】【一節】子貢曰、管仲非仁者與、桓公殺公子糾、不能死、又相\r\n之。【二節】子曰、管仲相桓公、霸諸侯、一匡天下、民到于今、受其賜、\r\n微管仲、吾其被髮左衽矣。【三節】豈若匹夫匹婦之為諒也、\r\n        2. The Master said, 'The Duke Hwan assembled all the \r\nprinces together, and that not with weapons of war and \r\nchariots:-- it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. \r\nWhose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like \r\nhis?'\r\n        CHAP. XVIII. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'Kwan Chung, I \r\napprehend, was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan \r\ncaused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able \r\nto die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'Kwan Chung acted as prime minister \r\nto the Duke Hwan, made him leader of all the princes, and \r\nunited and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present \r\nday, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for \r\nKwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and \r\nthe lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side.\r\n        3. 'Will you require from him the small fidelity of \r\ncommon\r\n\r\n自經於溝瀆、而莫之知也。\r\n【十九章】【一節】公叔文子之臣、大夫僎、與文子同升諸公。【二節】子\r\n聞之曰、可以為矣。\r\n【二十章】【一節】子言衛靈公之無道也、康子曰、夫如是、奚而不喪。【二\r\n節】孔子曰、仲叔圉治賓客、祝鮀治\r\nmen and common women, who would commit suicide in a \r\nstream or ditch, no one knowing anything about them?'\r\n        CHAP. XIX. 1. The great officer, Hsien, who had been \r\nfamily-minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince's \r\ncourt in company with Wan.\r\n        2. The Master, having heard of it, said, 'He deserved to be \r\nconsidered WAN (the accomplished).'\r\n        CHAP. XX. 1. The Master was speaking about the \r\nunprincipled course of the duke Ling of Wei, when Ch'i K'ang \r\nsaid, 'Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose \r\nhis State?'\r\n        2. Confucius said, 'The Chung-shu Yu has the \r\nsuperintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o, \r\nhas the management\r\n\r\n宗廟、王孫賈治軍旅、夫如是、奚其喪。\r\n【廿一章】子曰、其言之不怍、則為之也難。\r\n【廿二章】【一節】陳成子弒簡公。【二節】孔子沐浴而朝、告於哀公曰、\r\n陳恆弒其君、請討之。【三節】公曰、告夫三子。【四節】孔子曰、以吾從\r\n大夫之後、不敢不告也、君\r\nof his ancestral temple; and Wang-sun Chia has the direction of \r\nthe army and forces:-- with such officers as these, how should \r\nhe lose his State?'\r\n        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'He who speaks without \r\nmodesty will find it difficult to make his words good.'\r\n        CHAP. XXII. 1. Chan Ch'ang murdered the Duke Chien of \r\nCh'i.\r\n        2. Confucius bathed, went to court, and informed the \r\nduke Ai, saying, 'Chan Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that \r\nyou will undertake to punish him.'\r\n        3. The duke said, 'Inform the chiefs of the three families \r\nof it.'\r\n        4. Confucius retired, and said, 'Following in the rear of the \r\ngreat officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter, \r\nand my prince says, \"Inform the chiefs of the three families of \r\nit.\"'\r\n\r\n曰、告夫三子者。【四節】之三子告、不可、孔子曰、以吾從大夫之後、不\r\n敢不告也。\r\n【廿三章】子路問事君。子曰、勿欺也、而犯之。\r\n【廿四章】子曰、君子上達、小人下達。\r\n【廿五章】子曰、古之學者為己、今之學者為人。\r\n【廿六章】【一節】蘧伯玉使人於孔子。【二節】孔子與之坐、而問焉、曰、\r\n夫子何為。\r\n        5. He went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they \r\nwould not act. Confucius then said, 'Following in the rear of the \r\ngreat officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIII. Tsze-lu asked how a ruler should be served. \r\nThe Master said, 'Do not impose on him, and, moreover, \r\nwithstand him to his face.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. The Master said, 'The progress of the \r\nsuperior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is \r\ndownwards.'\r\n        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'In ancient times, men \r\nlearned with a view to their own improvement. Now-a-days, \r\nmen learn with a view to the approbation of others.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVI. 1. Chu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly \r\ninquiries to Confucius.\r\n        2. Confucius sat with him, and questioned him. 'What,' \r\nsaid he, 'is your master engaged in?' The messenger replied, \r\n'My master is\r\n\r\n對曰、夫子欲寡其過、而未能也、使者出、子曰、使乎、使乎。\r\n【廿七章】子曰、不在其位、不謀其政。\r\n【廿八章】曾子曰、君子思不出其位。\r\n【廿九章】子曰、君子恥其言而過其行。\r\n【三十章】【一節】子曰、君子道者三、我無能焉、仁者不憂、知者不惑、\r\n勇者不懼。【二節】子貢曰、夫子自道也。\r\nanxious to make his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.' \r\nHe then went out, and the Master said, 'A messenger indeed! A \r\nmessenger indeed!'\r\n        CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'He who is not in any \r\nparticular office, has nothing to do with plans for the \r\nadministration of its duties.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVIII. The philosopher Tsang said, 'The superior \r\nman, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIX. The Master said, 'The superior man is modest \r\nin his speech, but exceeds in his actions.'\r\n        CHAP. XXX. 1. The Master said, 'The way of the superior \r\nman is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free \r\nfrom anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is \r\nfree from fear.\r\n        2. Tsze-kung said, 'Master, that is what you yourself say.'\r\n\r\n【卅一章】子貢方人、子曰、賜也賢乎哉、夫我則不暇。\r\n【卅二章】子曰、不患人之不己知、患其不能也。\r\n【卅三章】子曰、不逆詐、不億不信、抑亦先覺者、是賢乎。\r\n【卅四章】【一節】微生畝謂孔子曰、丘何為是栖栖者與、無乃為佞乎。【二\r\n節】孔子曰、非敢為佞也、疾固也。\r\n        CHAP.

The Master said, 'I will not be concerned at \r\nmen's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of \r\nability.'\r\n        CHAP. XXXIII. The Master said, 'He who does not \r\nanticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his \r\nnot being believed, and yet apprehends these things readily \r\n(when they occur);-- is he not a man of superior worth?'\r\n        CHAP. XXXIV. 1. Wei-shang Mau said to Confucius, 'Ch'iu, \r\nhow is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an \r\ninsinuating talker?'\r\n        2. Confucius said, 'I do not dare to play the part of such a \r\ntalker, but I hate obstinacy.'\r\n\r\n【卅五章】子曰、驥、不稱其力、稱其德也。\r\n【卅六章】【一節】或曰、以德報怨、何如。【二節】子曰、何以報德。【三\r\n節】以直報怨、以德報德。\r\n【卅七章】【一節】子曰、莫我知也夫。【二節】子貢曰、何為其莫知子也。\r\n子曰、不怨天、不尤人、下學\r\n        CHAP.

I do not grumble against men. My studies lie low, and \r\nmy penetration rises high. But there is Heaven;-- that knows \r\nme!'\r\n        CHAP. XXXVIII. 1. The Kung-po Liao, having slandered \r\nTsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, \r\nsaying, 'Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po \r\nLiao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and \r\nexpose his corpse in the market and in the court.'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'If my principles are to advance, it is \r\nso ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. \r\nWhat can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is \r\nconcerned?'\r\n\r\n【卅九章】【一節】子曰、賢者辟世。【二節】其次辟地。【三節】其次辟\r\n色。【四節】其次辟言。\r\n【四十章】子曰、作者七人矣。\r\n【四一章】子路宿於石門、晨門曰、奚自。子路曰、自孔氏。曰、是知其不\r\n可而為之者與。\r\n【四二章】【一節】子擊磬於衛、有荷蕢、而過孔氏之門者、\r\n        CHAP.

Some retire because of contradictory language.'\r\n        CHAP. XL.  The Master said, 'Those who have done this \r\nare seven men.'\r\n        CHAP. XLI.

'It is he,-- is it not?'-- said the \r\nother, 'who knows the impracticable nature of the times and \r\nyet will be doing in them.'\r\n        CHAP. XLII. 1. The Master was playing, one day, on a \r\nmusical stone in Wei, when a man, carrying a straw basket, \r\npassed the door\r\n\r\n曰、有心哉、擊磬乎。【二節】既、而曰、鄙哉、硜硜乎、莫己知也、斯已\r\n而已矣、深則厲、淺則揭。【三節】子曰、果哉、末之難矣。\r\n【四三章】【一節】子張曰、書云、高宗諒陰三年不言、何謂也。【二節】\r\n子曰、何必高宗、古之人皆然、君薨、百官總己、以聽於冢宰、三年。\r\nof the house where Confucius was, and said, 'His heart is full \r\nwho so beats the musical stone.'\r\n        2. A little while after, he added, 'How contemptible is the \r\none-ideaed obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken \r\nno notice of, he has simply at once to give over his wish for \r\npublic employment. \"Deep water must be crossed with the \r\nclothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held \r\nup.\"'\r\n        3. The Master said, 'How determined is he in his purpose! \r\nBut this is not difficult!'\r\n        CHAP. XLIII. 1. Tsze-chang said, 'What is meant when the \r\nShu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial \r\nmourning, was for three years without speaking?'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'Why must Kao-tsung be referred to \r\nas an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the \r\nsovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, \r\ntaking instructions from the prime minister for three years.'\r\n\r\n【四四章】子曰、上好禮、則民易使也。\r\n【四五章】子路問君子、子曰、修己以敬。曰、如斯而已乎。曰、修己以安\r\n人、曰、如斯而已乎。曰、修己以安百姓。修己以安百姓、堯舜其猶病諸。\r\n【四六章】原壤夷俟、子曰、幼\r\n        CHAP.

Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior \r\nman. The Master said, 'The cultivation of himself in reverential \r\ncarefulness.' 'And is this all?' said Tsze-lu. 'He cultivates \r\nhimself so as to give rest to others,' was the reply. 'And is this \r\nall?' again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, 'He cultivates \r\nhimself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates himself \r\nso as to give rest to all the people:-- even Yao and Shun were \r\nstill solicitous about this.'\r\n        CHAP. XLVI. Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and\r\n\r\n而不孫弟、長而無述焉、老而不死、是為賊。以杖叩其脛。\r\n【四七章】【一節】闕黨童子將命、或問之曰、益者與。【二節】子曰、吾\r\n見其居於位也、見其與先生並行也、非求益者也、欲速成者也。\r\nso waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, 'In \r\nyouth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing \r\nworthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-- this is \r\nto be a pest.' With this he hit him on the shank with his staff.\r\n        CHAP. XLVI. 1. A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was \r\nemployed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and \r\nhis visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, 'I suppose he \r\nhas made great progress.'\r\n        2. The Master said, 'I observe that he is fond of occupying \r\nthe seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder \r\nto shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to \r\nmake progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.'\r\n\r\n衛靈公第十五\r\nBOOK XV.

The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about \r\ntactics. Confucius replied, 'I have heard all about sacrificial \r\nvessels, but I have not learned military matters.' On this, he \r\ntook his departure the next day.\r\n        2. When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, \r\nand his followers became so ill that they were unable to rise.\r\n        3. Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, 'Has the \r\nsuperior man likewise to endure in this way?' The Master said, \r\n'The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the \r\nmean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.'\r\n\r\n【第二章】【一節】子曰、賜也、女以予為多學而識之者與。【二節】對曰、\r\n然、非與。【三節】曰、非也、予一以貫之。\r\n【第三章】子曰、由、知德者鮮矣。\r\n【第四章】子曰、無為而治者、其舜也與、夫何為哉、恭己正南面而已矣。\r\n【第五章】【一節】子張問行。【二節】子曰、言忠信、行篤敬、雖蠻貊之\r\n邦、\r\n        CHAP. II. 1. The Master said, 'Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, \r\nthat I am one who learns many things and keeps them in \r\nmemory?'\r\n        2. Tsze-kung replied, 'Yes,-- but perhaps it is not so?'\r\n        3. 'No,' was the answer; 'I seek a unity all-pervading.'\r\n        CHAP. III.

Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct \r\nhimself, so as to be everywhere appreciated.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'Let his words be sincere and truthful, \r\nand his actions honourable and careful;-- such conduct may be \r\npractised among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If \r\nhis words be\r\n\r\n行矣、言不忠信、行不篤敬、雖州里、行乎哉。【三節】立、則見其參於前\r\n也、在輿、則見期倚於衡也、夫然後行。【四節】子張書諸紳。\r\n【第六章】【一節】子曰、直哉史魚、邦有道如矢、邦有道如矢。【二節】\r\n君子哉、蘧伯玉、邦有道、則仕、邦無道、則可卷而懷之。\r\nnot sincere and truthful and his actions not honourable and \r\ncareful, will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his \r\nneighborhood?\r\n        3. 'When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it \r\nwere, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them \r\nattached to the yoke.

The Master said, 'Truly straightforward was \r\nthe historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his \r\nState, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, \r\nhe was like an arrow.\r\n        2. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good \r\ngovernment prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. \r\nWhen bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, \r\nand keep them in his breast.'\r\n\r\n【第七章】子曰、可與言、而不與之言、失人、不可與言、而與之言、失言、\r\n知者不失人、亦不失言。\r\n【第八章】子曰、志士、仁人、無求生以害仁、有殺身以成仁。\r\n【第九章】子貢問為仁。子曰、工欲善其事、必先利其器、居是邦也、事其\r\n大夫之賢者、友其士之仁者。\r\n【第十章】【一節】顏淵問為邦。【二節】子曰、行夏之\r\n        CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'When a man may be spoken \r\nwith, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. \r\nWhen a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err \r\nin reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to \r\ntheir man nor to their words.'\r\n        CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'The determined scholar and \r\nthe man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of \r\ninjuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to \r\npreserve their virtue complete.'\r\n        CHAP. IX. Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. \r\nThe Master said, 'The mechanic, who wishes to do his work \r\nwell, must first sharpen his tools.

The Master said, 'If a man take no thought \r\nabout what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.'\r\n        CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'It is all over! I have not seen \r\none who loves virtue as he loves beauty.'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'Was not Tsang Wan like one \r\nwho had stolen his situation?

The Master said, 'When a man is not in the \r\nhabit of saying-- \"What shall I think of this? What shall I think \r\nof this?\" I can indeed do nothing with him!'\r\n        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'When a number of people \r\nare together, for a whole day, without their conversation \r\nturning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying \r\nout the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-- theirs is indeed a \r\nhard case.'\r\n        CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'The superior man in \r\neverything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs \r\nit according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in \r\nhumility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a \r\nsuperior man.'\r\n\r\n以成之、君子哉。\r\n【十八章】子曰、君子病無能焉、不病人之不己知也。\r\n【十九章】子曰、君子疾沒世、而名不稱焉。\r\n【二十章】子曰、君子求諸己、小人求諸人。\r\n【廿一章】子曰、君子矜而不爭、群而不黨。\r\n【廿二章】子曰、君子不以言舉人、不以\r\n        CHAP. XVIII.

What you do not \r\nwant done to yourself, do not do to others.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. 1. The Master said, 'In my dealings with \r\nmen, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, \r\nbeyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed in praise, \r\nthere must be ground for it in my examination of the \r\nindividual.\r\n        2. 'This people supplied the ground why the three \r\ndynasties pursued the path of straightforwardness.'\r\n        CHAP. XXV.

There is plowing;-- even in \r\nthat there is sometimes want. So with learning;-- emolument \r\nmay be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should \r\nnot get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon \r\nhim.'\r\n        CHAP. XXXII. 1. The Master said, 'When a man's \r\nknowledge is sufficient to attain, and his virtue is not sufficient \r\nto enable him to hold, whatever he may have gained, he will \r\nlose again.\r\n        2. 'When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has \r\nvirtue enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with dignity, the \r\npeople will not respect him.\r\n        3. 'When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has \r\nvirtue enough to hold fast; when he governs also with dignity, \r\nyet if he try to move the people contrary to the rules of \r\npropriety:-- full excellence is not reached.'\r\n\r\n【卅三章】子曰、君子不可小知、而可大受也、小人不可大受、而可小知也。\r\n【卅四章】子曰、民之於仁也、甚於水火、水火吾見蹈而死者矣、未見蹈仁\r\n而死者也。\r\n【卅五章】子曰、當仁、不讓於師。\r\n        CHAP. XXXIII. The Master said, 'The superior man cannot \r\nbe known in little matters; but he may be intrusted with great \r\nconcerns. The small man may not be intrusted with great \r\nconcerns, but he may be known in little matters.'\r\n        CHAP. XXXIV. The Master said, 'Virtue is more to man \r\nthan either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on \r\nwater and fire, but I have never seen a man die from treading \r\nthe course of virtue.'\r\n        CHAP. XXXV. The Master said, 'Let every man consider \r\nvirtue as what devolves on himself. He may not yield the \r\nperformance of it even to his teacher.'\r\n\r\n【卅六章】子曰、君子貞、而不諒。\r\n【卅七章】子曰、事君敬其事、而後其食。\r\n【卅八章】子曰、有教、無類。\r\n【卅九章】子曰、道不同、不相為謀。\r\n【四十章】子曰、辭、達而已矣。\r\n【四一章】【一節】師冕見、及階、子曰、階也。及席、子曰、席也。\r\n        CHAP.

The Music-master, Mien, having called upon \r\nhim, when they came to the steps, the Master said, 'Here are \r\nthe steps.' When they came to the mat for the guest to sit upon, \r\nhe\r\n\r\n皆坐、子告之曰、某在斯、某在斯。【二節】師冕出、子張問曰、與師言之\r\n道與。【三節】子曰、然、固相師之道也。\r\nsaid, 'Here is the mat.'

'Is it the rule to tell those things to the Music-\r\nmaster?' \r\n        3. The Master said, 'Yes. This is certainly the rule for \r\nthose who lead the blind.'\r\n\r\n李氏第十六\r\nBOOK XVI.

Confucius said, 'Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault \r\nhere?\r\n        4. 'Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king \r\nappointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern \r\nMang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; \r\nand its ruler is a minister in direct connexion with the \r\nsovereign:-- What has your chief to do with attacking it?'\r\n        5. Zan Yu said, 'Our master wishes the thing; neither of us \r\ntwo ministers wishes it.'\r\n        6. Confucius said, 'Ch'iu, there are the words of Chau \r\nZan,-- \"When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in \r\nthe ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he \r\nretires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, \r\nwho does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up \r\nwhen fallen?\"\r\n        7. 'And further, you speak wrongly.

Zan Yu said, 'But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and \r\nnear to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a \r\nsorrow to his descendants.'\r\n        9. Confucius said. 'Ch'iu, the superior man hates that \r\ndeclining to say-- \"I want such and such a thing,\" and framing \r\nexplanations for the conduct.\r\n        10. 'I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of \r\nfamilies are not troubled lest their people should be few, but \r\nare troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that \r\nthey are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled \r\nwith fears of a want of contented repose among the people in \r\ntheir several places. For when the people keep their several \r\nplaces, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there \r\nwill be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a \r\ncontented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.\r\n        11.

When \r\nbad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and \r\npunitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When \r\nthese things proceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will \r\nbe few in which they do not lose their power in ten \r\ngenerations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the \r\nprinces, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not \r\nlose their power in five generations.

The government \r\nhas been in the hands of the Great officers for four generations. \r\nOn this account, the descendants of the three Hwan are much \r\nreduced.'\r\n        CHAP. IV. Confucius said, 'There are three friendships \r\nwhich are advantageous, and three which are injurious. \r\nFriendship with the upright; friendship with the sincere; and \r\nfriendship with the man of much observation:-- these are \r\nadvantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; \r\nfriendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the \r\nglib-tongued:-- these are injurious.'\r\n        CHAP. V. Confucius said, 'There are three things men find \r\nenjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they \r\nfind enjoyment in which are injurious. To find enjoyment in the \r\ndiscriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find \r\nenjoyment in\r\n\r\n樂道人之善、樂多賢友、益矣。樂驕樂、樂佚遊、樂宴樂、損矣。\r\n【第六章】孔子曰、侍於君子有三愆、言未及之而言、謂之躁、言及之而不\r\n言、謂之隱、未見顏色而言、謂之瞽。\r\n【第七章】孔子曰、君子有三戒、少之時、血氣未定、戒之\r\nspeaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having \r\nmany worthy friends:-- these are advantageous. To find \r\nenjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in \r\nidleness and sauntering; to find enjoyment in the pleasures of \r\nfeasting:-- these are injurious.'\r\n        CHAP. VI. Confucius said, 'There are three errors to which \r\nthey who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station \r\nare liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to \r\nspeak;-- this is called rashness. They may not speak when it \r\ncomes to them to speak;-- this is called concealment. They may \r\nspeak without looking at the countenance of their superior;-- \r\nthis is called blindness.'\r\n        CHAP. VII. Confucius said, 'There are three things which \r\nthe superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical \r\npowers\r\n\r\n在色、及其壯也、血氣方剛、戒之在鬥、及其老也、血氣既衰、戒之在得。\r\n【第八章】【一節】孔子曰、君子有三畏、畏天命、畏大人、畏聖人之言。\r\n【二節】小人不知天命、而不畏也、狎大人、侮聖人之言。\r\n【第九章】孔子曰、生而知之者、上也、學而知之者、次也、\r\nare not yet settled, he guards against lust.

When he is old, and the animal powers are \r\ndecayed, he guards against covetousness.'\r\n        CHAP. VIII. 1. Confucius said, 'There are three things of \r\nwhich the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the \r\nordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands \r\nin awe of the words of sages.\r\n        2. 'The mean man does not know the ordinances of \r\nHeaven, and consequently does not stand in awe of them. He is \r\ndisrespectful to great men. He makes sport of the words of \r\nsages.'\r\n        CHAP. IX. Confucius said, 'Those who are born with the \r\npossession of knowledge are the highest class of men. Those \r\nwho learn, and so, readily, get possession of knowledge, are the \r\nnext.\r\n\r\n困而學之、又其次也、困而不學、民斯為下矣。\r\n【第十章】孔子曰、君子有九思、視思明、聽思聰、色思溫、貌思恭、言思\r\n忠、事思敬、疑思問、忿思難、見得思義。\r\n【十一章】【一節】孔子曰、見善如不及、見不善而探湯、吾見其人矣、吾\r\n聞其語矣。【二節】隱居\r\nThose who are dull and stupid, and yet compass the learning, \r\nare another class next to these. As to those who are dull and \r\nstupid and yet do not learn;-- they are the lowest of the \r\npeople.'\r\n        CHAP. X. Confucius said, 'The superior man has nine \r\nthings which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. \r\nIn regard to the use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In \r\nregard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear distinctly. In \r\nregard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be \r\nbenign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious that it should \r\nbe respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it \r\nshould be sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is \r\nanxious that it should be reverently careful. In regard to what \r\nhe doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is \r\nangry, he thinks of the difficulties (his anger may involve him \r\nin). When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness.'\r\n        CHAP. XI. 1. Confucius said, 'Contemplating good, and \r\npursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil, \r\nand shrinking from it, as they would from thrusting the hand \r\ninto boiling water:-- I have seen such men, as I have heard \r\nsuch words.\r\n        2.

XII. 1. The duke Ching of Ch'i had a thousand \r\nteams, each of four horses, but on the day of his death, the \r\npeople did not praise him for a single virtue.

'Is not that saying illustrated by this?'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. 1. Ch'an K'ang asked Po-yu, saying, 'Have you \r\nheard any lessons from your father different from what we \r\nhave all heard?'\r\n        2. Po-yu replied, 'No. He was standing alone once, when I \r\npassed below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, \"Have \r\nyou learned the Odes?\" On my replying \"Not yet,\" he added, \"If \r\nyou do not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse with.\" \r\nI retired and studied the Odes.\r\n\r\n鯉退而學詩。【三節】他日、又獨立、鯉趨而過庭、曰、學禮乎。對曰、未\r\n也。不學禮、無以立。鯉退而學禮。【四節】聞斯二者。【五節】陳亢退而\r\n喜曰、問一得三、聞詩、聞禮、又聞君子遠其子也。\r\n【十四章】邦君子之妻、君稱之曰夫人、夫人自稱小童、邦人稱之、曰君夫\r\n人、稱\r\n        3.

'I have heard only these two things from him.'\r\n        5. Ch'ang K'ang retired, and, quite delighted, said, 'I asked \r\none thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about the \r\nOdes. I have heard about the rules of Propriety. I have also \r\nheard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve \r\ntowards his son.'\r\n        CHAP. XIV.

Ho said to Confucius, 'Come, let me speak with you.' He \r\nthen asked, 'Can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in \r\nhis\r\n\r\n事而亟失時、可謂知乎。曰、不可。日月逝矣、歲不我與。孔子曰、諾、吾\r\n將仕矣。\r\n【第二章】子曰、性相近也、習相遠也。\r\n【第三章】子曰、唯上知與下愚不移。\r\nbosom, and leaves his country to confusion?'

Tsze-yu replied, 'Formerly, Master, I heard you say,-- \r\n\"When the man of high station is well instructed, he loves men; \r\nwhen the man of low station is well instructed, he is easily \r\nruled.\"'\r\n        4.

Tsze-chang asked Confucius about perfect \r\nvirtue. Confucius said, 'To be able to practise five things \r\neverywhere under heaven constitutes perfect virtue.' He \r\nbegged to ask what they were, and was told, 'Gravity, \r\ngenerosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you \r\nare grave, you will not be treated with disrespect. If you are \r\ngenerous, you will win all. If you are sincere, people will repose \r\ntrust in you. If you are earnest, you will accomplish much.

The Master said, 'Yes, I did use these words. But is it \r\nnot said, that, if a thing be really hard, it may be ground \r\nwithout being made thin?

The Master said, 'He who puts on an \r\nappearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like \r\none of the small, mean people;-- yea, is he not like the thief \r\nwho breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?'\r\n        CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'Your good, careful people of \r\nthe villages are the thieves of virtue.'\r\n        CHAP. XIV.

'While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is \r\nhow to get them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest \r\nthey should lose them.\r\n        3. 'When they are anxious lest such things should be lost, \r\nthere is nothing to which they will not proceed.'\r\n        CHAP. XVI. 1. The Master said, 'Anciently, men had three \r\nfailings, which now perhaps are not to be found.\r\n        2. 'The high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a \r\ndisregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the present \r\nday shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity \r\nshowed itself in grave reserve; the stern dignity of the present \r\nday shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness.

XVII. The Master said, 'Fine words and an \r\ninsinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue.'\r\n        CHAP. XVIII. The Master said, 'I hate the manner in \r\nwhich purple takes away the luster of vermilion. I hate the \r\nway in which the songs of Chang confound the music of the Ya. \r\nI hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms \r\nand families.'\r\n        CHAP. XIX. 1. The Master said, 'I would prefer not \r\nspeaking.'\r\n        2. Tsze-kung said, 'If you, Master, do not speak, what \r\nshall we, your disciples, have to record?'\r\n        3.

XX. Zu Pei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius \r\ndeclined, on the ground of being sick, to see him. When the \r\nbearer of this message went out at the door, (the Master) took \r\nhis lute and sang to it, in order that Pei might hear him.\r\n        CHAP. XXI. 1. Tsai Wo asked about the three years' \r\nmourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough.\r\n        2. 'If the superior man,' said he, 'abstains for three years \r\nfrom the observances of propriety, those observances will be \r\nquite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will \r\nbe ruined.\r\n        3. 'Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new \r\ngrain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go \r\nthrough all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a \r\ncomplete year, the mourning may stop.'\r\n        4. The Master said, 'If you were, after a year, to eat good \r\nrice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?' 'I \r\nshould,' replied Wo.\r\n\r\n於女安乎。曰、安。【五節】女安、則為之、夫君子之居喪、食旨不甘、聞\r\n樂不樂、居處不安、故不為也、今女安、則為之。【六節】宰我出。子曰、\r\n予之不仁也、子生三年、然後免於父母之懷、夫三年之喪、天下之通喪也、\r\n予也、有三年之愛於其父母乎。\r\n        5. The Master said, 'If you can feel at ease, do it. But a \r\nsuperior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not \r\nenjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure \r\nfrom music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if \r\nhe is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you \r\npropose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.'\r\n        6. Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, 'This \r\nshows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old \r\nthat it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three \r\nyears' mourning is universally observed throughout the \r\nempire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his parents?'\r\n\r\n【廿二章】子曰、飽食終日、無所用心、難矣哉、不有博弈者乎、為之猶賢\r\n乎已。\r\n【廿三章】子路曰、君子尚勇乎。子曰、君子義以為上、君子有勇而無義、\r\n為亂、小人有勇而無義、為盜。\r\n【廿四章】【一節】子貢曰、君子亦有惡乎。子曰、有惡、惡稱人之惡者、\r\n惡居下流而訕上\r\n        CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'Hard is it to deal with him, \r\nwho will stuff himself with food the whole day, without \r\napplying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters \r\nand chess players? To be one of these would still be better than \r\ndoing nothing at all.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIII. Tsze-lu said, 'Does the superior man esteem \r\nvalour?' The Master said, 'The superior man holds \r\nrighteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior \r\nsituation, having valour without righteousness, will be guilty of \r\ninsubordination; one of the lower people having valour without \r\nrighteousness, will commit robbery.'\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'Has the superior man his \r\nhatreds also?' The Master said, 'He has his hatreds. He hates \r\nthose who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who,\r\n\r\n者、惡勇而無禮者、惡果敢而窒者。【二節】曰、賜也亦有惡乎。惡徼以為\r\n知者、惡不孫以為勇者、惡訐以為直者。\r\n【廿五章】子曰、唯女子與小人、為難養也、近之則不孫、遠之則怨。\r\n【廿六章】子曰、年四十而見惡焉、其終也已。\r\nbeing in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those \r\nwho have valour merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He \r\nhates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same \r\ntime, of contracted understanding.'\r\n        2. The Master then inquired, 'Ts'ze, have you also your \r\nhatreds?' Tsze-kung replied, 'I hate those who pry out matters, \r\nand ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who \r\nare only not modest, and think that they are valourous. I hate \r\nthose who make known secrets, and think that they are \r\nstraightforward.'\r\n        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'Of all people, girls and \r\nservants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar \r\nwith them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve \r\ntowards them, they are discontented.'\r\n        CHAP. XXVI. The Master said, 'When a man at forty is the \r\nobject of dislike, he will always continue what he is.'\r\n\r\n微子第十八\r\nBOOK XVIII.

The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the \r\nmanner in which he should treat Confucius, said, 'I cannot treat \r\nhim as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a \r\nmanner between that accorded to the chief of the Chi, and that \r\ngiven to the chief of the Mang family.' He also said, 'I am old; I \r\ncannot use his doctrines.' Confucius took his departure.\r\n        CHAP. IV. The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of \r\nfemale musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days \r\nno court was held.

Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, \r\nbut Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with \r\nhim.\r\n        CHAP. VI. 1. Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the \r\nfield together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-\r\nlu to inquire for the ford.\r\n        2. Ch'ang-tsu said, 'Who is he that holds the reins in the \r\ncarriage there?' Tsze-lu told him, 'It is K'ung Ch'iu.' 'Is it not \r\nK'ung Ch'iu of Lu?' asked he. 'Yes,' was the reply, to which the \r\nother rejoined, 'He knows the ford.'\r\n        3. Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \r\n'Who\r\n\r\n溺。桀溺曰。子為誰。曰、為仲由。曰、是魯孔丘之徒與。對曰、然。曰、\r\n滔滔者、天下皆是也、而誰以易之、且而與其從辟人之士也、豈若從辟世之\r\n士哉。耰而不輟。【四節】子路行以告、夫子憮然曰、鳥獸不可與同群、吾\r\n非斯人之徒與而誰與、天下有道、丘不與易也。\r\nare you, sir?'

'I am,' replied \r\nhe, and then Chieh-ni said to him, 'Disorder, like a swelling \r\nflood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will \r\nchange its state for you? Than follow one who merely \r\nwithdraws from this one and that one, had you not better \r\nfollow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?' \r\nWith this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with \r\nhis work, without stopping.\r\n        4. Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the \r\nMaster observed with a sigh, 'It is impossible to associate with \r\nbirds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I \r\nassociate not with these people,-- with mankind,-- with whom \r\nshall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the \r\nempire, there would be no use for me to change its state.'\r\n\r\n【第七章】【一節】子路從而後、遇丈人、以杖荷蓧。子路問曰、子見夫子\r\n乎。丈人曰、四禮不勤、五穀不分、孰為夫子。植其杖而芸。【二節】子路\r\n拱而立。【三節】止子路宿、殺雞為黍而食之、見其二子焉。【四節】明日、\r\n子路行以告。子曰、隱者也、使子路反見之、至、則行矣。【五節】子路曰、\r\n不仕\r\n        CHAP. VII. 1. Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to \r\nfall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his \r\nshoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, \r\n'Have you seen my master, sir!' The old man replied, 'Your four \r\nlimbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five \r\nkinds of grain:-- who is your master?' With this, he planted his \r\nstaff in the ground, and proceeded to weed.\r\n        2. Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood \r\nbefore him.\r\n        3. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his \r\nhouse, killed a fowl, prepared millet, and feasted him. He also \r\nintroduced to him his two sons.\r\n        4. Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his \r\nadventure. The Master said, 'He is a recluse,' and sent Tsze-lu \r\nback to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old \r\nman was gone.\r\n        5. Tsze-lu then said to the family, 'Not to take office is not\r\n\r\n無義。長幼之節、不可廢也、君臣之義、如之何其廢之、欲潔其身、而亂大\r\n倫、君子之仕也、行其義也、道之不行、已知之矣。\r\n【第八章】【一節】逸民、伯夷、叔齊、虞仲、夷逸、朱張、柳下惠、少連。\r\n【二節】子曰、不降其志、不辱其身、伯夷叔齊與。【三節】謂柳下惠少連、\r\n降志辱身矣、言\r\nrighteous. If the relations between old and young may not be \r\nneglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be \r\nobserved between sovereign and minister? Wishing to \r\nmaintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to \r\ncome to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs \r\nthe righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right \r\nprinciples to make progress, he is aware of that.'\r\n        CHAP. VIII. 1. The men who have retired to privacy from \r\nthe world have been Po-i, Shu-ch'i, Yu-chung, I-yi, Chu-chang, \r\nHui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien.\r\n        2. The Master said, 'Refusing to surrender their wills, or \r\nto submit to any taint in their persons;-- such, I think, were \r\nPo-i and Shu-ch'i.\r\n        3. 'It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia, and of Shao-lien, that \r\nthey surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their \r\npersons,\r\n\r\n中倫、行中慮、其斯而已矣。【四節】謂虞仲夷逸、隱居放言、身中清、廢\r\n中權。【五節】我則異於是、無可無不可。\r\n【第九章】【一節】大師摯適齊。【二節】亞飯干適楚。三飯繚適蔡。四飯\r\n缺適秦。【三節】鼓方叔、\r\nbut their words corresponded with reason, and their actions \r\nwere such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be \r\nremarked in them.\r\n        4. 'It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they \r\nhid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their \r\nwords; but, in their persons, they succeeded in preserving their \r\npurity, and, in their retirement, they acted according to the \r\nexigency of the times.\r\n        5. 'I am different from all these. I have no course for \r\nwhich I am predetermined, and no course against which I am \r\npredetermined.'\r\n        CHAP. IX. 1. The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i.\r\n        2. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went \r\nto Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. \r\nChueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in.\r\n        3.

Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of \r\nthe musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea.\r\n        CHAP. X. The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of \r\nLu, saying, 'The virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. \r\nHe does not cause the great ministers to repine at his not \r\nemploying them. Without some great cause, he does not dismiss \r\nfrom their offices the members of old families. He does not \r\nseek in one man talents for every employment.'\r\n        CHAP. XI. To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, \r\nPo-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu, Shu-ya, Shu-hsia, Chi-sui, and \r\nChi-kwa.\r\n\r\n子張第十九\r\nBOOK XIX.

Tsze-chang said, 'The scholar, trained for public \r\nduty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. \r\nWhen the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of \r\nrighteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In \r\nmourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should \r\nfeel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed.'\r\n        CHAP. II. Tsze-chang said, 'When a man holds fast to \r\nvirtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes right \r\nprinciples, but without firm sincerity, what account can be \r\nmade of his existence or non-existence?'\r\n\r\n【第三章】子夏之門人問交於子張。子張曰、子夏云何。對曰、子夏曰、可\r\n者與之、其不可者拒之。子張曰、異乎吾所聞、君子尊賢而容眾、嘉善而矜\r\n不能、我之大賢與、於人何所不容、我之不賢與、人將拒我、如之何其拒人\r\n也。\r\n【第四章】子夏曰、雖小道、必有\r\n        CHAP. III. The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang \r\nabout the principles that should characterize mutual \r\nintercourse. Tsze-chang asked, 'What does Tsze-hsia say on the \r\nsubject?' They replied, 'Tsze-hsia says:-- \"Associate with those \r\nwho can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot \r\ndo so.\"' Tsze-chang observed, 'This is different from what I \r\nhave learned. The superior man honours the talented and \r\nvirtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the \r\nincompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue?-- \r\nwho is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I \r\ndevoid of talents and virtue?-- men will put me away from \r\nthem. What have we to do with the putting away of others?'\r\n        CHAP. IV. Tsze-hsia said, 'Even in inferior studies and \r\nemployments there is something worth being looked at; but if \r\nit be\r\n\r\n可觀者焉、致遠恐泥、是以君子不為也。\r\n【第五章】子夏曰、日知其所亡、月無忘其所能、可謂好學也已矣。\r\n【第六章】子夏曰、博學而篤志、切問而近思、仁在其中矣。\r\n【第七章】子夏曰、百工居肆、以成其事、君子學以致其道。\r\nattempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a \r\ndanger of their proving inapplicable. Therefore, the superior \r\nman does not practise them.'\r\n        CHAP. V. Tsze-hsia said, 'He, who from day to day \r\nrecognises what he has not yet, and from month to month does \r\nnot forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love \r\nto learn.'\r\n        CHAP. VI. Tsze-hsia said, 'There are learning extensively, \r\nand having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, \r\nand reflecting with self-application:-- virtue is in such a \r\ncourse.'\r\n        CHAP. VII. Tsze-hsia said, 'Mechanics have their shops to \r\ndwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man \r\nlearns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.'\r\n\r\n【第八章】子夏曰、小人之過也、必文。\r\n【第九章】子夏曰、君子有三變、望之儼然、即之也溫、聽其言也厲。\r\n【第十章】子夏曰、君子信而後勞其民、未信、則以為厲己也、信而後諫、\r\n未信、則以為謗己也。\r\n【十一章】子夏曰、大德不踰閑、\r\n        CHAP. VIII. Tsze-hsia said, 'The mean man is sure to gloss \r\nhis faults.'\r\n        CHAP. IX. Tsze-hsia said, 'The superior man undergoes \r\nthree changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; \r\nwhen approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his \r\nlanguage is firm and decided.'\r\n        CHAP. X. Tsze-hsia said, 'The superior man, having \r\nobtained their confidence, may then impose labours on his \r\npeople. If he have not gained their confidence, they will think \r\nthat he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence of \r\nhis prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not \r\ngained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying \r\nhim.'\r\n        CHAP. XI. Tsze-hsia said, 'When a person does not \r\ntransgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass \r\nand repass it in the small virtues.'\r\n\r\n小德出入可也。\r\n【十二章】【一節】子游曰、子夏之門人小子、當洒掃、應對、進退、則可\r\n矣、抑末也、本之則無、如之何。【二節】子夏聞之曰、噫、言游過矣、君\r\n子之道、孰先傳焉、孰後倦焉、譬諸草木、區以別矣、君子之道、焉可誣也、\r\n有始有卒者、其惟聖人乎。\r\n        CHAP. XII. 1. Tsze-yu said, 'The disciples and followers of \r\nTsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering \r\nand replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently \r\naccomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and \r\nthey are left ignorant of what is essential.-- How can they be \r\nacknowledged as sufficiently taught?'\r\n        2. Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, 'Alas! Yen Yu \r\nis wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, \r\nwhat departments are there which he considers of prime \r\nimportance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of \r\nsecondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But \r\nas in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their \r\nclasses, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a \r\nsuperior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not \r\nthe sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the \r\nconsummation of learning?'\r\n\r\n【十三章】子夏曰、仕而優則學、學而優則仕。\r\n【十四章】子游曰、喪致乎哀而止。\r\n【十五章】子游曰、吾友張也、為難能也、然而未仁。\r\n【十六章】曾子曰、堂堂乎張也、難與並為仁矣。\r\n【十七章】曾子曰、吾聞諸夫子、人未有自致者也、必也親喪乎。\r\n        CHAP. XIII. Tsze-hsia said, 'The officer, having discharged \r\nall his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, \r\nhaving completed his learning, should apply himself to be an \r\nofficer.'\r\n        CHAP. XIV. Tsze-hsia said, 'Mourning, having been carried \r\nto the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.'\r\n        CHAP. XV. Tsze-hsia said, 'My friend Chang can do things \r\nwhich are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.'\r\n        CHAP. XVI. The philosopher Tsang said, 'How imposing is \r\nthe manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practise \r\nvirtue.'\r\n        CHAP. XVII. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I heard this \r\nfrom our Master:-- \"Men may not have shown what is in them \r\nto the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on \r\noccasion of mourning for their parents.\"'\r\n\r\n【十八章】曾子曰、吾聞諸夫子、孟莊子之孝也、其他可能也、其不改父之\r\n臣、與父之政、是難能也。\r\n【十九章】孟氏使陽膚為士師、問於曾子。曾子曰、上失其道、民散、久矣、\r\n如得其情、則哀矜而勿喜。\r\n【二十章】子貢曰、紂之不善、不如是之甚也、是以君子\r\n        CHAP. XVIII. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I have heard \r\nthis from our Master:-- \"The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in \r\nother matters, was what other men are competent to, but, as \r\nseen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his \r\nfather's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.\"'\r\n        CHAP. XIX. The chief of the Mang family having \r\nappointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter \r\nconsulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, 'The rulers have \r\nfailed in their duties, and the people consequently have been \r\ndisorganised, for a long time. When you have found out the \r\ntruth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do \r\nnot feel joy at your own ability.'\r\n        CHAP. XX. Tsze-kung said, 'Chau's wickedness was not so \r\ngreat as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates \r\nto dwell\r\n\r\n惡居下流、天下之惡皆歸焉。\r\n【廿一章】子貢曰、君子之過也、如日月之食焉、過也、人皆見之、更也、\r\n人皆仰之。\r\n【廿二章】【一節】衛公孫朝問於子貢曰、仲尼焉學。【二節】子貢曰、文\r\n武之道、未墜於地、在人、賢者識其大者、不賢者識其小者、莫不有文武之\r\n道焉、夫子焉不學、而亦何常師之有、\r\nin a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will \r\nflow in upon him.'\r\n        CHAP. XXI. Tsze-kung said, 'The faults of the superior \r\nman are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his \r\nfaults, and all men see them; he changes again, and all men \r\nlook up to him.'\r\n        CHAP. XXII. 1. Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tsze-kung, \r\nsaying, 'From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?'\r\n        2. Tsze-kung replied, 'The doctrines of Wan and Wu have \r\nnot yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. \r\nMen of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of \r\nthem, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, \r\nremember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan \r\nand Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an \r\nopportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was \r\nthere for his having a regular master?'\r\n\r\n【廿三章】【一節】叔孫武叔語大夫於朝曰、子貢賢於仲尼。【二節】子服\r\n景伯以告子貢。子貢曰、譬之宮牆、賜之牆也、及肩、窺見室家之好。【三\r\n節】夫子之牆、數仞、不得其門而入、不見宗廟之美、百官之富。【四節】\r\n得其門者或寡矣、夫子之云、不亦宜乎。\r\n        CHAP. XXIII. 1. Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great \r\nofficers in the court, saying, 'Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.'\r\n        2. Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-\r\nkung, who said, 'Let me use the comparison of a house and its \r\nencompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One \r\nmay peep over it, and see whatever is valuable in the \r\napartments.\r\n        3. 'The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one \r\ndo not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral \r\ntemple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array.\r\n        4. 'But I may assume that they are few who find the door. \r\nWas not the observation of the chief only what might have \r\nbeen expected?'\r\n\r\n【廿四章】叔孫武叔毀仲尼。子貢曰、無以為也、仲尼不可毀也、他人之賢\r\n者、丘陵也、猶可踰也、仲尼、日月也、無得而踰焉、人雖欲自絕、其何傷\r\n於日月乎、多見其不知量也。\r\n【廿五章】【一節】陳子禽謂子貢曰、子為恭也、仲尼豈賢於子乎。【二節】\r\n子貢曰、君子一言以為知、一言以為不知、言不可不慎也。【三節】夫子之\r\n        CHAP. XXIV. Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of \r\nChung-ni, Tsze-kung said, 'It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni \r\ncannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are \r\nhillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is \r\nthe sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although \r\na man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm \r\ncan he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not \r\nknow his own capacity.\r\n        CHAP. XXV. 1. Ch'an Tsze-ch'in, addressing Tsze-kung, \r\nsaid, 'You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be \r\nsuperior to you?'\r\n        2. Tsze-kung said to him, 'For one word a man is often \r\ndeemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be \r\nfoolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say.\r\n        3.

'Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a State \r\nor the chief of a Family, we should find verified the description \r\nwhich has been given of a sage's rule:-- he would plant the \r\npeople, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead \r\nthem on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make \r\nthem happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his \r\ndominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would \r\nbe harmonious.

If there shall be distress and \r\nwant within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a \r\nperpetual end.'\r\n        2. Shun also used the same language in giving charge to \r\nYu.\r\n        3. T'ang said, 'I the child Li, presume to use a dark-\r\ncoloured victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most \r\ngreat and sovereign God, that the sinner I dare not pardon, and \r\nthy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity.

The people are throwing blame upon me, \r\nthe One man.'\r\n        6. He carefully attended to the weights and measures, \r\nexamined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, \r\nand the good government of the kingdom took its course.\r\n        7. He revived States that had been extinguished, restored \r\nfamilies whose line of succession had been broken, and called \r\nto office those who had retired into obscurity, so that \r\nthroughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned \r\ntowards him.\r\n        8. What he attached chief importance to, were the food of \r\nthe people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices.\r\n        9. By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made \r\nthe people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his \r\nachievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted.\r\n\r\n【第二章】【一節】子張問於孔子曰、何如、斯可以從政矣。子曰、尊五美、\r\n屏四惡、斯可以從政矣。子張曰、何謂五美。子曰、君子惠、而不費、勞、\r\n而不怨、欲、而不貪、泰、而不驕、威、而不猛。【二節】子張曰、何謂惠\r\n而不費。子曰、因民之所利而利之、\r\n        CHAP. II. 1. Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, 'In what \r\nway should a person in authority act in order that he may \r\nconduct government properly?' The Master replied, 'Let him \r\nhonour the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, \r\nthings;-- then may he conduct government properly.' Tsze-\r\nchang said, 'What are meant by the five excellent things?' The \r\nMaster said, 'When the person in authority is beneficent \r\nwithout great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people \r\nwithout their repining; when he pursues what he desires \r\nwithout being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease \r\nwithout being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.'\r\n        2. Tsze-chang said, 'What is meant by being beneficent \r\nwithout great expenditure?' The Master replied, 'When the \r\nperson in authority makes more beneficial to the people the \r\nthings from which\r\n\r\n斯不亦惠而不費乎、擇可勞而勞之、又誰怨、欲仁而得仁、又焉貪、君子無\r\n眾寡、無小大、無敢慢、斯不亦泰而不驕乎、君子正其衣冠、尊其瞻視、儼\r\n然人望而畏之、斯不亦威而不猛乎。【三節】子張曰、何謂四惡。子曰、不\r\n教而殺、謂之虐、不戒視成、謂之暴、慢令致期、謂之賊、猶\r\nthey naturally derive benefit;-- is not this being beneficent \r\nwithout great expenditure? When he chooses the labours which \r\nare proper, and makes them labour on them, who will repine? \r\nWhen his desires are set on benevolent government, and he \r\nsecures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he \r\nhas to do with many people or few, or with things great or \r\nsmall, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-- is not this \r\nto maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his \r\nclothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, \r\nthus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-- is not this to be \r\nmajestic without being fierce?'\r\n        3. Tsze-chang then asked, 'What are meant by the four \r\nbad things?' The Master said, 'To put the people to death \r\nwithout having instructed them;-- this is called cruelty. To \r\nrequire from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without \r\nhaving given them warning;-- this is called oppression. To issue \r\norders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time \r\ncomes, to insist on them with severity;-- this is called injury. \r\nAnd, generally, in the giving pay\r\n\r\n之與人也、出納之吝、謂之有司。\r\n【第三章】【一節】子曰、不知命、無以為君子也。【二節】不知禮、無以\r\n立也。【三節】不知言、無以知人也。\r\nor rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-- this is called \r\nacting the part of a mere official.'\r\n        CHAP III. 1. The Master said, 'Without recognising the \r\nordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man.\r\n        2. 'Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it \r\nis impossible for the character to be established.\r\n        3. 'Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to \r\nknow men.'",
