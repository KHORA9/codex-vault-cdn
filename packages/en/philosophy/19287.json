THE SUN OF TRUTH HATH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO peoples of the world! The Sun of Truth hath risen to illumine the whole\r\nearth, and to spiritualize the community of man. Laudable are the results\r\nand the fruits thereof, abundant the holy evidences deriving from this\r\ngrace. This is mercy unalloyed and purest bounty; it is light for the\r\nworld and all its peoples; it is harmony and fellowship, and love and\r\nsolidarity; indeed it is compassion and unity, and the end of foreignness;\r\nit is the being at one, in complete dignity and freedom, with all on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe Blessed Beauty saith: 'Ye are all the fruits of one tree, the leaves\r\nof one branch.' Thus hath He likened this world of being to a single tree,\r\nand all its peoples to the leaves thereof, and the blossoms and fruits. It\r\nis needful for the bough to blossom, and leaf and fruit to flourish, and\r\nupon the interconnection of all parts of the world-tree, dependeth the\r\nflourishing of leaf and blossom, and the sweetness of the fruit.\r\n\r\nFor this reason must all human beings powerfully sustain one another and\r\nseek for everlasting life; and for this reason must the lovers of God in\r\nthis contingent world become the mercies and the blessings sent forth by\r\nthat clement King of the seen and unseen realms. Let them purify their\r\nsight and behold all humankind as leaves and blossoms and fruits of the\r\ntree of being. Let them at all times concern themselves with doing a\r\nkindly thing for one of their fellows, offering to someone love,\r\nconsideration, thoughtful help. Let them see no one as their enemy, or as\r\nwishing them ill, but think of all humankind as their friends; regarding\r\nthe alien as an intimate, the stranger as a companion, staying free of\r\nprejudice, drawing no lines.\r\n\r\nIn this day, the one favoured at the Threshold of the Lord is he who\r\nhandeth round the cup of faithfulness; who bestoweth, even upon his\r\nenemies, the jewel of bounty, and lendeth, even to his fallen oppressor, a\r\nhelping hand; it is he who will, even to the fiercest of his foes, be a\r\nloving friend. These are the Teachings of the Blessed Beauty, these the\r\ncounsels of the Most Great Name.\r\n\r\nO ye dear friends! The world is at war and the human race is in travail\r\nand mortal combat. The dark night of hate hath taken over, and the light\r\nof good faith is blotted out. The peoples and kindreds of the earth have\r\nsharpened their claws, and are hurling themselves one against the other.\r\nIt is the very foundation of the human race that is being destroyed. It is\r\nthousands of households that are vagrant and dispossessed, and every year\r\nseeth thousands upon thousands of human beings weltering in their\r\nlife-blood on dusty battlefields. The tents of life and joy are down. The\r\ngenerals practise their generalship, boasting of the blood they shed,\r\ncompeting one with the next in inciting to violence. 'With this sword,'\r\nsaith one of them, 'I beheaded a people!' And another: 'I toppled a nation\r\nto the ground!' And yet another: 'I brought a government down!' On such\r\nthings do men pride themselves, in such do they glory!\r\nLove--righteousness--these are everywhere censured, while despised are\r\nharmony, and devotion to the truth.\r\n\r\nThe Faith of the Blessed Beauty is summoning mankind to safety and love,\r\nto amity and peace; it hath raised up its tabernacle on the heights of the\r\nearth, and directeth its call to all nations. Wherefore, O ye who are\r\nGod's lovers, know ye the value of this precious Faith, obey its\r\nteachings, walk in this road that is drawn straight, and show ye this way\r\nto the people. Lift up your voices and sing out the song of the Kingdom.\r\nSpread far and wide the precepts and counsels of the loving Lord, so that\r\nthis world will change into another world, and this darksome earth will be\r\nflooded with light, and the dead body of mankind will arise and live; so\r\nthat every soul will ask for immortality, through the holy breaths of God.\r\n\r\nSoon will your swiftly-passing days be over, and the fame and riches, the\r\ncomforts, the joys provided by this rubbish-heap, the world, will be gone\r\nwithout a trace. Summon ye, then, the people to God, and invite humanity\r\nto follow the example of the Company on high. Be ye loving fathers to the\r\norphan, and a refuge to the helpless, and a treasury for the poor, and a\r\ncure for the ailing. Be ye the helpers of every victim of oppression, the\r\npatrons of the disadvantaged. Think ye at all times of rendering some\r\nservice to every member of the human race. Pay ye no heed to aversion and\r\nrejection, to disdain, hostility, injustice: act ye in the opposite way.\r\nBe ye sincerely kind, not in appearance only. Let each one of God's loved\r\nones centre his attention on this: to be the Lord's mercy to man; to be\r\nthe Lord's grace. Let him do some good to every person whose path he\r\ncrosseth, and be of some benefit to him. Let him improve the character of\r\neach and all, and reorient the minds of men. In this way, the light of\r\ndivine guidance will shine forth, and the blessings of God will cradle all\r\nmankind: for love is light, no matter in what abode it dwelleth; and hate\r\nis darkness, no matter where it may make its nest. O friends of God! That\r\nthe hidden Mystery may stand revealed, and the secret essence of all\r\nthings may be disclosed, strive ye to banish that darkness for ever and\r\never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: O MY LORD! I HAVE DRAWN NIGH UNTO THEE, IN THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO my Lord! I have drawn nigh unto Thee, in the depths of this darksome\r\nnight, confiding in Thee with the tongue of my heart, trembling with joy\r\nat the sweet scents that blow from Thy realm, the All-Glorious, calling\r\nunto Thee, saying:\r\n\r\nO my Lord, no words do I find to glorify Thee; no way do I see for the\r\nbird of my mind to soar upward to Thy Kingdom of Holiness; for Thou, in\r\nThy very essence, art sanctified above those tributes, and in Thy very\r\nbeing art beyond the reach of those praises which are offered Thee by the\r\npeople that Thou hast created. In the sanctity of Thine own being hast\r\nThou ever been exalted above the understanding of the learned among the\r\nCompany on high, and forever wilt Thou remain enwrapped within the\r\nholiness of Thine own reality, unreached by the knowledge of those\r\ndwellers in Thine exalted Kingdom who glorify Thy Name.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! How can I glorify or describe Thee inaccessible as Thou\r\nart; immeasurably high and sanctified art Thou above every description and\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Have mercy then upon my helpless state, my poverty, my\r\nmisery, my abasement! Give me to drink from the generous cup of Thy grace\r\nand forgiveness, stir me with the sweet scents of Thy love, gladden my\r\nbosom with the light of Thy knowledge, purify my soul with the mysteries\r\nof Thy oneness, raise me to life with the gentle breeze that cometh from\r\nthe gardens of Thy mercy--till I sever myself from all else but Thee, and\r\nlay hold of the hem of Thy garment of grandeur, and consign to oblivion\r\nall that is not Thee, and be companioned by the sweet breathings that waft\r\nduring these Thy days, and attain unto faithfulness at Thy Threshold of\r\nHoliness, and arise to serve Thy Cause, and to be humble before Thy loved\r\nones, and, in the presence of Thy favoured ones, to be nothingness itself.\r\n\r\nVerily art Thou the Helper, the Sustainer, the Exalted, the Most Generous.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! I beg of Thee by the dawning of the light of Thy Beauty\r\nthat hath illumined all the earth, and by the glance of Thy divine\r\ncompassion's eye that considereth all things, and by the surging sea of\r\nThy bestowals in which all things are immersed, and by Thy streaming\r\nclouds of bounty raining down gifts upon the essences of all created\r\nthings, and by the splendours of Thy mercy that existed before ever the\r\nworld was--to help Thy chosen ones to be faithful, and assist Thy loved\r\nones to serve at Thine exalted Threshold, and cause them to gain the\r\nvictory through the battalions of Thy might that overpowereth all things,\r\nand reinforce them with a great fighting host from out of the Concourse on\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nO my Lord! They are weak souls standing at Thy door; they are paupers in\r\nThy courtyard, desperate for Thy grace, in dire need of Thy succour,\r\nturning their faces toward the kingdom of Thy oneness, yearning for the\r\nbounties of Thy bestowals. O my Lord! Flood Thou their minds with Thy holy\r\nlight; cleanse Thou their hearts with the grace of Thine assistance;\r\ngladden their bosoms with the fragrance of the joys that waft from Thy\r\nCompany above; make bright their eyes by beholding the signs and tokens of\r\nThy might; cause them to be the ensigns of purity, the banners of sanctity\r\nwaving high above all creatures on the summits of the earth; make Thou\r\ntheir words to move hearts which are even as solid rock. May they arise to\r\nserve Thee and dedicate themselves to the Kingdom of Thy divinity, and set\r\ntheir faces toward the realm of Thy Self-Subsistence, and spread far and\r\nwide Thy signs, and be illumined by Thy streaming lights, and unfold Thy\r\nhidden mysteries. May they guide Thy servants unto gentle waters and to\r\nthe fountain of Thy mercy that welleth and leapeth in the midmost heart of\r\nthe Heaven of Thy oneness. May they hoist the sail of detachment upon the\r\nArk of Salvation, and move over the seas of Thy knowledge; may they spread\r\nwide the pinions of unity and by their aid soar upward to the Kingdom of\r\nThy singleness to become servants whom the Supreme Concourse will applaud,\r\nwhose praises the dwellers in Thine all-glorious realm will utter; may\r\nthey hear the heralds of the invisible world as they raise their cry of\r\nthe Most Great Glad-Tidings; may they, in their longing to meet Thee,\r\ninvoke and pray unto Thee, intoning wondrous orisons at the dawn of\r\nlight--O my Lord Who disposest all things--shedding their tears at\r\nmorningtide and even, yearning to pass into the shadow of Thy mercy that\r\nendeth never.\r\n\r\nHelp them, O my Lord, under all conditions, support them at all times with\r\nThine angels of holiness, they who are Thine invisible hosts, Thy heavenly\r\nbattalions who bring down to defeat the massed armies of this nether\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nVerily art Thou the Mighty, the Powerful, the Strong, the\r\nAll-Encompassing, the One Who hath dominion over all that is.\r\n\r\nO holy Lord! O Lord of loving-kindness! We stray about Thy dwelling,\r\nlonging to behold Thy beauty, and loving all Thy ways. We are hapless,\r\nlowly, and of small account. We are paupers: show us mercy, give us\r\nbounty; look not upon our failings, hide Thou our endless sins. Whatever\r\nwe are, still are we Thine, and what we speak and hear is praise of Thee,\r\nand it is Thy face we seek, Thy path we follow. Thou art the Lord of\r\nloving-kindness, we are sinners and astray and far from home. Wherefore, O\r\nCloud of Mercy, grant us some drops of rain. O Flowering Bed of grace,\r\nsend forth a fragrant breeze. O Sea of all bestowals, roll towards us a\r\ngreat wave. O Sun of Bounty, send down a shaft of light. Grant us pity,\r\ngrant us grace. By Thy beauty, we come with no provision but our sins,\r\nwith no good deeds to tell of, only hopes. Unless Thy concealing veil doth\r\ncover us, and Thy protection shield and cradle us, what power have these\r\nhelpless souls to rise and serve Thee, what substance have these wretched\r\nones to make a brave display? Thou Who art the Mighty, the All-Powerful,\r\nhelp us, favour us; withered as we are, revive us with showers from Thy\r\nclouds of grace; lowly as we are, illumine us with bright rays from the\r\nDay-Star of Thy oneness. Cast Thou these thirsty fish into the ocean of\r\nThy mercy, guide Thou this lost caravan to the shelter of Thy singleness;\r\nto the wellspring of guidance lead Thou the ones who have wandered far\r\nastray, and grant to those who have missed the path a haven within the\r\nprecincts of Thy might. Lift Thou to these parched lips the bounteous and\r\nsoft-flowing waters of heaven, raise up these dead to everlasting life.\r\nGrant Thou to the blind eyes that will see. Make Thou the deaf to hear,\r\nthe dumb to speak. Set Thou the dispirited ablaze, make Thou the heedless\r\nmindful, warn Thou the proud, awaken those who sleep.\r\n\r\nThou art the Mighty, Thou art the Bestower, Thou art the Loving. Verily\r\nThou art the Beneficent, the Most Exalted.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God, ye helpers of this evanescent Servant! When the\r\nSun of Reality shed its endless bounties from the Dawning-Point of all\r\ndesires, and this world of being was lit with that sacred light from pole\r\nto pole, with such intensity did it cast down its rays that it blotted out\r\nthe Stygian dark forever, whereupon this earth of dust became the envy of\r\nthe spheres of heaven, and this lowly place took on the state and panoply\r\nof the supernal realm. The gentle breeze of holiness blew over it,\r\nscattering abroad sweet savours; the spring winds of heaven passed by it,\r\nand over it, from the Source of all bestowals, were wafted fruitful airs\r\nthat carried boundless grace. Then the bright dawn rose, and there came\r\ntidings of great joy. The divine springtime was here, pitching its tents\r\nin this contingent world, so that all creation leapt and danced. The\r\nwithered earth brought forth immortal blooms, the dead dust woke to\r\neverlasting life. Then came forth flowers of mystic learning, and,\r\nbespeaking the knowledge of God, fresh greenery from the ground. The\r\ncontingent world displayed God's bounteous gifts, the visible world\r\nreflecting the glories of realms that were hidden from sight. God's\r\nsummons was proclaimed, the table of the Eternal Covenant was readied, the\r\ncup of the Testament was passed from hand to hand, the universal\r\ninvitation was sent forth. Then some among the people were set afire with\r\nthe wine of heaven, and some were left without a share of this greatest of\r\nbestowals. The sight and insight of some were illumined by the light of\r\ngrace, and there were some who, hearing the anthems of unity, leapt for\r\njoy. There were birds that began to carol in the gardens of holiness,\r\nthere were nightingales in the branches of the rose tree of heaven that\r\nraised their plaintive cries. Then were decked and adorned both the\r\nKingdom on high and the earth below, and this world became the envy of\r\nhigh heaven. Yet alas, alas, the neglectful have stayed fast in their\r\nheedless sleep, and the foolish have spurned this most sacred of\r\nbestowals. The blind remain shrouded in their veils, the deaf have no\r\nshare in what hath come to pass, the dead have no hopes of attaining\r\nthereto, for even as He saith: 'They despair of the life to come, as the\r\ninfidels despair that the dwellers in the tombs will rise again.'(1)\r\n\r\nAs to you, O ye loved ones of God! Loose your tongues and offer Him\r\nthanks; praise ye and glorify the Beauty of the Adored One, for ye have\r\ndrunk from this purest of chalices, and ye are cheered and set aglow with\r\nthis wine. Ye have detected the sweet scents of holiness, ye have smelled\r\nthe musk of faithfulness from Joseph's raiment. Ye have fed on the\r\nhoney-dew of loyalty from the hands of Him Who is the one alone Beloved,\r\nye have feasted on immortal dishes at the bounteous banquet table of the\r\nLord. This plenty is a special favour bestowed by a loving God, these are\r\nblessings and rare gifts deriving from His grace. In the Gospel He saith:\r\n'For many are called, but few are chosen.'(2) That is, to many is it\r\noffered, but rare is the soul who is singled out to receive the great\r\nbestowal of guidance. 'Such is the bounty of God: to whom He will He\r\ngiveth it, and of immense bounty is God.'(3)\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! From the peoples of the world, against the Candle\r\nof the Covenant discordant winds do beat and blow. The Nightingale of\r\nfaithfulness is beset by renegades who are even as ravens of hate. The\r\nDove of God's remembrance is hard pressed by mindless birds of night, and\r\nthe Gazelle that dwelleth in the meadows of God's love is being hunted\r\ndown by ravening beasts. Deadly is the peril, tormenting the pain.\r\n\r\nThe beloved of the Lord must stand fixed as the mountains, firm as\r\nimpregnable walls. Unmoved must they remain by even the direst\r\nadversities, ungrieved by the worst of disasters. Let them cling to the\r\nhem of Almighty God, and put their faith in the Beauty of the Most High;\r\nlet them lean on the unfailing help that cometh from the Ancient Kingdom,\r\nand depend on the care and protection of the generous Lord. Let them at\r\nall times refresh and restore themselves with the dews of heavenly grace,\r\nand with the breaths of the Holy Spirit revive and renew themselves from\r\nmoment to moment. Let them rise up to serve their Lord, and do all in\r\ntheir power to scatter His breathings of holiness far and wide. Let them\r\nbe a mighty fortress to defend His Faith, an impregnable citadel for the\r\nhosts of the Ancient Beauty. Let them faithfully guard the edifice of the\r\nCause of God from every side; let them become the bright stars of His\r\nluminous skies. For the hordes of darkness are assailing this Cause from\r\nevery direction, and the peoples of the earth are intent on extinguishing\r\nthis evident Light. And since all the kindreds of the world are mounting\r\ntheir attack, how can our attention be diverted, even for a moment?\r\nAssuredly be cognizant of these things, be watchful, and guard the Cause\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nThe most vital duty, in this day, is to purify your characters, to correct\r\nyour manners, and improve your conduct. The beloved of the Merciful must\r\nshow forth such character and conduct among His creatures, that the\r\nfragrance of their holiness may be shed upon the whole world, and may\r\nquicken the dead, inasmuch as the purpose of the Manifestation of God and\r\nthe dawning of the limitless lights of the Invisible is to educate the\r\nsouls of men, and refine the character of every living man--so that blessed\r\nindividuals, who have freed themselves from the murk of the animal world,\r\nshall rise up with those qualities which are the adornings of the reality\r\nof man. The purpose is that earthlings should turn into the people of\r\nHeaven, and those who walk in darkness should come into the light, and\r\nthose who are excluded should join the inner circle of the Kingdom, and\r\nthose who are as nothing should become intimates of the everlasting Glory.\r\nIt is that the portionless should gain their share of the boundless sea,\r\nand the ignorant drink their fill from the living fount of knowledge; that\r\nthose who thirst for blood should forsake their savagery, and those who\r\nare barbed of claw should turn gentle and forbearing, and those who love\r\nwar should seek instead for true conciliation; it is that the brutal,\r\ntheir talons razor-sharp, should enjoy the benefits of lasting peace; that\r\nthe foul should learn that there is a realm of purity, and the tainted\r\nfind their way to the rivers of holiness.\r\n\r\nUnless these divine bestowals be revealed from the inner self of\r\nhumankind, the bounty of the Manifestation will prove barren, and the\r\ndazzling rays of the Sun of Truth will have no effect whatever.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O beloved of the Lord, strive ye with heart and soul to receive\r\na share of His holy attributes and take your portion of the bounties of\r\nHis sanctity--that ye may become the tokens of unity, the standards of\r\nsingleness, and seek out the meaning of oneness; that ye may, in this\r\ngarden of God, lift up your voices and sing the blissful anthems of the\r\nspirit. Become ye as the birds who offer Him their thanks, and in the\r\nblossoming bowers of life chant ye such melodies as will dazzle the minds\r\nof those who know. Raise ye a banner on the highest peaks of the world, a\r\nflag of God's favour to ripple and wave in the winds of His grace; plant\r\nye a tree in the field of life, amid the roses of this visible world, that\r\nwill yield a fruitage fresh and sweet.\r\n\r\nI swear by the true Teacher that if ye will act in accord with the\r\nadmonitions of God, as revealed in His luminous Tablets, this darksome\r\ndust will mirror forth the Kingdom of heaven, and this nether world the\r\nrealm of the All-Glorious.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of the Lord! Praise be to Him, the unseen, welling\r\nbounties of the Sun of Truth encompass you on every side, and from every\r\ndirection the portals of His mercy stand ajar. Now is the time to take\r\nadvantage of these bestowals, and benefit therefrom. Know ye the value of\r\nthis time, let not this chance escape you. Stay ye entirely clear of this\r\ndark world's concerns, and become ye known by the attributes of those\r\nessences that make their home in the Kingdom. Then shall ye see how\r\nintense is the glory of the heavenly Day-Star, and how blinding bright are\r\nthe tokens of bounty coming out of the invisible realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: O YE BELOVED OF GOD! O YE CHILDREN OF HIS KINGDOM! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of God! O ye children of His Kingdom! Verily, verily, the new\r\nheaven and the new earth are come. The holy City, new Jerusalem, hath come\r\ndown from on high in the form of a maid of heaven, veiled, beauteous, and\r\nunique, and prepared for reunion with her lovers on earth. The angelic\r\ncompany of the Celestial Concourse hath joined in a call that hath run\r\nthroughout the universe, all loudly and mightily acclaiming: 'This is the\r\nCity of God and His abode, wherein shall dwell the pure and holy among His\r\nservants. He shall live with them, for they are His people and He is their\r\nLord.'\r\n\r\nHe hath wiped away their tears, kindled their light, rejoiced their hearts\r\nand enraptured their souls. Death shall no more overtake them neither\r\nshall sorrow, weeping or tribulation afflict them. The Lord God Omnipotent\r\nhath been enthroned in His Kingdom and hath made all things new. This is\r\nthe truth and what truth can be greater than that announced by the\r\nRevelation of St. John the Divine?\r\n\r\nHe is Alpha and Omega. He is the One that will give unto him that is\r\nathirst of the fountain of the water of life and bestow upon the sick the\r\nremedy of true salvation. He whom such grace aideth is verily he that\r\nreceiveth the most glorious heritage from the Prophets of God and His holy\r\nones. The Lord will be his God, and he His dearly-beloved son.\r\n\r\nRejoice, then, O ye beloved of the Lord and His chosen ones, and ye the\r\nchildren of God and His people, raise your voices to laud and magnify the\r\nLord, the Most High; for His light hath beamed forth, His signs have\r\nappeared and the billows of His rising ocean have scattered on every shore\r\nmany a precious pearl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: PRAISE BE TO HIM WHO HATH MADE THE WORLD OF BEING, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise be to Him Who hath made the world of being, and hath fashioned all\r\nthat is, Him Who hath raised up the sincere to a station of honour(4) and\r\nhath made the invisible world to appear on the plane of the visible--yet\r\nstill, in their drunken stupor,(5) do men wander and stray.\r\n\r\nHe hath laid down the foundations of the lofty Citadel, He hath\r\ninaugurated the Cycle of Glory, He hath brought forth a new creation on\r\nthis day that is clearly Judgement Day--and still do the heedless stay fast\r\nin their drunken sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Bugle(6) hath sounded, the Trumpet(7) hath been blown, the Crier hath\r\nraised his call, and all upon the earth have swooned away--but still do the\r\ndead, in the tombs of their bodies, sleep on.\r\n\r\nAnd the second clarion(8) hath sounded, there hath followed the second\r\nblast after the first,(9) and the dread woe hath come, and every nursing\r\nmother hath forgot the infant at her breast(10)--yet still the people,\r\nconfused and distracted, heed it not.\r\n\r\nAnd the Resurrection hath dawned, and the Hour hath struck, and the Path\r\nhath been drawn straight, and the Balance hath been set up, and all upon\r\nthe earth have been gathered together(11)--but still the people see no sign\r\nof the way.\r\n\r\nThe light hath shone forth, and radiance floodeth Mount Sinai, and a\r\ngentle wind bloweth from over the gardens of the Ever-Forgiving Lord; the\r\nsweet breaths of the spirit are passing by, and those who lay buried in\r\nthe grave are rising up--and still do the heedless slumber on in their\r\ntombs.\r\n\r\nThe flames of hell have been made to blaze, and heaven hath been brought\r\nnigh; the celestial gardens are in flower, and fresh pools are brimming\r\nover, and paradise gleameth in beauty--but the unaware are still mired down\r\nin their empty dreams.\r\n\r\nThe veil hath fallen away, the curtain is lifted, the clouds have parted,\r\nthe Lord of Lords is in plain sight--yet all hath passed the sinners by.\r\n\r\nIt is He Who hath made for you the new creation,(12) and brought on the\r\nwoe(13) that surpasseth all others, and gathered the holy together in the\r\nrealm on high. Verily in this are signs for those who have eyes to see.\r\n\r\nAnd among His signs is the appearance of omens and joyous prophecies, of\r\nhints and clues, the spreading of many and various tidings, and the\r\nanticipations of the righteous, they who have now attained their goal.\r\n\r\nAnd among His signs are His splendours, rising above the horizon of\r\noneness, His lights streaming out from the dayspring of might, and the\r\nannouncement of the Most Great Glad-Tidings by His Herald, the One, the\r\nIncomparable. Verily in this is a brilliant proof for the company of those\r\nwho know.\r\n\r\nAmong His signs is His being manifest, being seen by all, standing as His\r\nown proof, and His presence among witnesses in every region, among peoples\r\nwho fell upon Him even as wolves, and compassed Him about from every side.\r\n\r\nAmong His signs is His withstanding powerful nations and all-conquering\r\nstates, and a host of enemies thirsting for His blood, intent at every\r\nmoment upon His ruin, wheresoever He might be. Verily this is a matter\r\ndeserving the scrutiny of those who ponder the signs and tokens of God.\r\n\r\nAnother of His signs is the marvel of His discourse, the eloquence of His\r\nutterance, the rapidity with which His Writings were revealed, His words\r\nof wisdom, His verses, His epistles, His communes, His unfolding of the\r\nQur'an, both the abstruse verses thereof and the clear. By thy very life!\r\nThis thing is plain as day to whoever will regard it with the eye of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nAgain among His signs is the dawning sun of His knowledge, and the rising\r\nmoon of His arts and skills, and His demonstrating perfection in all His\r\nways, as testified by the learned and accomplished of many nations.\r\n\r\nAnd again among His signs is the fact that His beauty stayed inviolate,\r\nand His human temple was protected as He revealed His splendours, despite\r\nthe massed attacks of all His foes, who came against Him in their\r\nthousands with their darting arrows, spears and swords. Herein is verily a\r\nwonder and a warning to any fair judge.\r\n\r\nAnd among His signs is His long-suffering, His tribulations and His woes,\r\nHis agony in His chains and fetters, and His calling out at every moment:\r\n'Come unto Me, come unto Me, ye righteous! Come unto Me, come unto Me, ye\r\nlovers of the good! Come unto Me, come unto Me, ye dawning points of\r\nlight!' Verily the gates of mystery are opened wide--but still do the\r\nwicked disport themselves with their vain cavillings!(14)\r\n\r\nYet another of His signs is the promulgation of His Book, His decisive\r\nHoly Text wherein He reproved the kings, and His dire warning to that\r\none(15) whose mighty rule was felt around the world--and whose great throne\r\nthen toppled down in a matter of brief days--this being a fact clearly\r\nestablished and widely known.\r\n\r\nAnd among His signs is the sublimity of His grandeur, His exalted state,\r\nHis towering glory, and the shining out of His beauty above the horizon of\r\nthe Prison: so that heads were bowed before Him and voices lowered, and\r\nhumble were the faces that turned His way. This is a proof never witnessed\r\nin the ages gone before.\r\n\r\nAgain among His signs are the extraordinary things He continually did, the\r\nmiracles He performed, the wonders appearing from Him without interruption\r\nlike the streaming down of His clouds--and the acknowledgement, even by\r\nunbelievers, of His powerful light. By His own life! This was clearly\r\nverified, it was demonstrated to those of every persuasion who came into\r\nthe presence of the living, the self-subsisting Lord.\r\n\r\nAnd yet another of His signs is the wide-spreading rays of the sun of His\r\nera, the rising moon of His times in the heaven of all the ages: His day,\r\nwhich standeth at the summit of all days, for its rank and power, its\r\nsciences and its arts, reaching far and wide, that have dazzled the world\r\nand astonished the minds of men.\r\n\r\nVerily is this a matter settled and established for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: THE WORLD'S GREAT LIGHT, ONCE RESPLENDENT UPON ALL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world's great Light, once resplendent upon all mankind, hath set, to\r\nshine everlastingly from the Abha Horizon, His Kingdom of fadeless glory,\r\nshedding splendour upon His loved ones from on high and breathing into\r\ntheir hearts and souls the breath of eternal life.\r\n\r\nPonder in your hearts that which He hath foretold in His Tablet of the\r\nDivine Vision that hath been spread throughout the world. Therein He\r\nsaith: 'Thereupon she wailed and exclaimed: \"May the world and all that is\r\ntherein be a ransom for Thy woes. O Sovereign of heaven and earth!\r\nWherefore hast Thou left Thyself in the hands of the dwellers of this\r\nprison-city of Akka? Hasten Thou to other dominions, to Thy retreats\r\nabove, whereon the eyes of the people of names have never fallen.\" We\r\nsmiled and spake not. Reflect upon these most exalted words, and\r\ncomprehend the purpose of this hidden and sacred mystery.'\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! Beware, beware lest ye hesitate and waver. Let\r\nnot fear fall upon you, neither be troubled nor dismayed. Take ye good\r\nheed lest this calamitous day slacken the flames of your ardour, and\r\nquench your tender hopes. Today is the day for steadfastness and\r\nconstancy. Blessed are they that stand firm and immovable as the rock and\r\nbrave the storm and stress of this tempestuous hour. They, verily, shall\r\nbe the recipients of God's grace; they, verily, shall receive His divine\r\nassistance, and shall be truly victorious. They shall shine amidst mankind\r\nwith a radiance which the dwellers of the Pavilion of Glory laud and\r\nmagnify. To them is proclaimed this celestial call, revealed in His Most\r\nHoly Book: 'Let not your hearts be perturbed, O people, when the glory of\r\nMy Presence is withdrawn, and the ocean of My utterance is stilled. In My\r\npresence amongst you there is a wisdom, and in My absence there is yet\r\nanother, inscrutable to all but God, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing.\r\nVerily, We behold you from Our realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever\r\nwill arise for the triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on\r\nhigh and a company of Our favoured angels.'\r\n\r\nThe Sun of Truth, that Most Great Light, hath set upon the horizon of the\r\nworld to rise with deathless splendour over the Realm of the Limitless. In\r\nHis Most Holy Book He calleth the firm and steadfast of His friends: 'Be\r\nnot dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the day-star of My beauty is\r\nset, and the heaven of My tabernacle is concealed from your eyes. Arise to\r\nfurther My Cause, and to exalt My Word amongst men.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: O YE PEOPLES OF THE KINGDOM! HOW MANY A SOUL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye peoples of the Kingdom! How many a soul expended all its span of life\r\nin worship, endured the mortification of the flesh, longed to gain an\r\nentry into the Kingdom, and yet failed, while ye, with neither toil nor\r\npain nor self-denial, have won the prize and entered in.\r\n\r\nIt is even as in the time of the Messiah, when the Pharisees and the pious\r\nwere left without a portion, while Peter, John and Andrew, given neither\r\nto pious worship nor ascetic practice, won the day. Wherefore, thank ye\r\nGod for setting upon your heads the crown of glory everlasting, for\r\ngranting unto you this immeasurable grace.\r\n\r\nThe time hath come when, as a thank-offering for this bestowal, ye should\r\ngrow in faith and constancy as day followeth day, and should draw ever\r\nnearer to the Lord, your God, becoming magnetized to such a degree, and so\r\naflame, that your holy melodies in praise of the Beloved will reach upward\r\nto the Company on high; and that each one of you, even as a nightingale in\r\nthis rose garden of God, will glorify the Lord of Hosts, and become the\r\nteacher of all who dwell on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: O YE SPIRITUAL FRIENDS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! A TRUSTED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye spiritual friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha! A trusted messenger hath arrived\r\nand hath, in the world of the spirit, delivered a message from God's loved\r\nones. This auspicious courier bringeth fragrances of great ardour and\r\nwafteth the life-giving breezes of the love of God. He maketh the heart to\r\ndance for joy and filleth up the soul with an ecstasy of love and rapture.\r\nSo intensely hath the glory of Divine Unity penetrated souls and hearts\r\nthat all are now bound one to another with heavenly ties, and all are even\r\nas a single heart, a single soul. Wherefore reflections of the spirit and\r\nimpressions of the Divine are now mirrored clear and sharp in the deep\r\nheart's core. I beg of God to strengthen these spiritual bonds as day\r\nfolloweth day, and make this mystic oneness to shine ever more brightly,\r\nuntil at last all shall be as troops marshalled together beneath the\r\nbanner of the Covenant within the sheltering shade of the Word of God;\r\nthat they may strive with all their might until universal fellowship,\r\nclose and warm, and unalloyed love, and spiritual relationships, will\r\nconnect all the hearts in the world. Then will all humankind, because of\r\nthis fresh and dazzling bounty, be gathered in a single homeland. Then\r\nwill conflict and dissension vanish from the face of the earth, then will\r\nmankind be cradled in love for the beauty of the All-Glorious. Discord\r\nwill change to accord, dissension to unison. The roots of malevolence will\r\nbe torn out, the basis of aggression destroyed. The bright rays of union\r\nwill obliterate the darkness of limitations, and the splendours of heaven\r\nwill make the human heart to be even as a mine veined richly with the love\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of the Lord! This is the hour when ye must associate with\r\nall the earth's peoples in extreme kindliness and love, and be to them the\r\nsigns and tokens of God's great mercy. Ye must become the very soul of the\r\nworld, the living spirit in the body of the children of men. In this\r\nwondrous Age, at this time when the Ancient Beauty, the Most Great Name,\r\nbearing unnumbered gifts, hath risen above the horizon of the world, the\r\nWord of God hath infused such awesome power into the inmost essence of\r\nhumankind that He hath stripped men's human qualities of all effect, and\r\nhath, with His all-conquering might, unified the peoples in a vast sea of\r\noneness.\r\n\r\nNow is the time for the lovers of God to raise high the banners of unity,\r\nto intone, in the assemblages of the world, the verses of friendship and\r\nlove and to demonstrate to all that the grace of God is one. Thus will the\r\ntabernacles of holiness be upraised on the summits of the earth, gathering\r\nall peoples into the protective shadow of the Word of Oneness. This great\r\nbounty will dawn over the world at the time when the lovers of God shall\r\narise to carry out His Teachings, and to scatter far and wide the fresh,\r\nsweet scents of universal love.\r\n\r\nIn every dispensation, there hath been the commandment of fellowship and\r\nlove, but it was a commandment limited to the community of those in mutual\r\nagreement, not to the dissident foe. In this wondrous age, however,\r\npraised be God, the commandments of God are not delimited, not restricted\r\nto any one group of people, rather have all the friends been commanded to\r\nshow forth fellowship and love, consideration and generosity and\r\nloving-kindness to every community on earth. Now must the lovers of God\r\narise to carry out these instructions of His: let them be kindly fathers\r\nto the children of the human race, and compassionate brothers to the\r\nyouth, and self-denying offspring to those bent with years. The meaning of\r\nthis is that ye must show forth tenderness and love to every human being,\r\neven to your enemies, and welcome them all with unalloyed friendship, good\r\ncheer, and loving-kindness. When ye meet with cruelty and persecution at\r\nanother's hands, keep faith with him; when malevolence is directed your\r\nway, respond with a friendly heart. To the spears and arrows rained upon\r\nyou, expose your breasts for a target mirror-bright; and in return for\r\ncurses, taunts and wounding words, show forth abounding love. Thus will\r\nall peoples witness the power of the Most Great Name, and every nation\r\nacknowledge the might of the Ancient Beauty, and see how He hath toppled\r\ndown the walls of discord, and how surely He hath guided all the peoples\r\nof the earth to oneness; how He hath lit man's world, and made this earth\r\nof dust to send forth streams of light.\r\n\r\nThese human creatures are even as children, they are brash and\r\nunconcerned. These children must be reared with infinite, loving care, and\r\ntenderly fostered in the embraces of mercy, so that they may taste the\r\nspiritual honey-sweetness of God's love; that they may become like unto\r\ncandles shedding their beams across this darksome world, and may clearly\r\nperceive what blazing crowns of glory the Most Great Name, the Ancient\r\nBeauty, hath set on the brows of His beloved, what bounties He hath\r\nbestowed on the hearts of those He holdeth dear, what a love He hath cast\r\ninto the breasts of humankind, and what treasures of friendship He hath\r\nmade to appear amongst all men.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Aid Thou Thy trusted servants to have loving and tender\r\nhearts. Help them to spread, amongst all the nations of the earth, the\r\nlight of guidance that cometh from the Company on high. Verily Thou art\r\nthe Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Subduing, the Ever-Giving.\r\nVerily Thou art the Generous, the Gentle, the Tender, the Most Bountiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: O YE BELOVED OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA AND YE HANDMAIDS OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of 'Abdu'l-Baha and ye handmaids of the Merciful! It is early\r\nmorning, and the reviving winds of the Abha Paradise are blowing over all\r\ncreation, but they can stir only the pure of heart, and only the pure\r\nsense can detect their fragrance. Only the perceiving eye beholdeth the\r\nrays of the sun; only the listening ear can hear the singing of the\r\nConcourse on high. Although the plentiful rains of spring, the bestowals\r\nof Heaven, pour down upon all things, they can only fructify good soil;\r\nthey love not brackish ground, where no results of all the bounty can be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nToday the soft and holy breathings of the Abha Realm are passing over\r\nevery land, but only the pure in heart draw nigh and derive a benefit\r\ntherefrom. It is the hope of this wronged soul that from the grace of the\r\nSelf-Subsistent One and by the manifest power of the Word of God, the\r\nheads of the unmindful may be cleared, that they may perceive these sweet\r\nsavours which blow from secret rosebeds of the spirit.\r\n\r\nO ye friends of God! True friends are even as skilled physicians, and the\r\nTeachings of God are as healing balm, a medicine for the conscience of\r\nman. They clear the head, so that a man can breathe them in and delight in\r\ntheir sweet fragrance. They waken those who sleep. They bring awareness to\r\nthe unheeding, and a portion to the outcast, and to the hopeless, hope.\r\n\r\nIf in this day a soul shall act according to the precepts and the counsels\r\nof God, he will serve as a divine physician to mankind, and like the trump\r\nof Israfil,(16) he will call the dead of this contingent world to life;\r\nfor the confirmations of the Abha Realm are never interrupted, and such a\r\nvirtuous soul hath, to befriend him, the unfailing help of the Company on\r\nhigh. Thus shall a sorry gnat become an eagle in the fulness of his\r\nstrength, and a feeble sparrow change to a royal falcon in the heights of\r\nancient glory.\r\n\r\nWherefore, look not on the degree of your capacity, ask not if you are\r\nworthy of the task: rest ye your hopes on the help and loving-kindness,\r\nthe favours and bestowals of Baha'u'llah--may my soul be offered up for His\r\nfriends! Urge on the steed of high endeavour over the field of sacrifice,\r\nand carry away from this wide arena the prize of divine grace.\r\n\r\nO ye handmaids of the merciful Lord! How many queens of this world laid\r\ndown their heads on a pillow of dust and disappeared. No fruit was left of\r\nthem, no trace, no sign, not even their names. For them, no more granting\r\nof bestowals; for them, no more living at all. Not so the handmaids who\r\nministered at the Threshold of God; these have shone forth like glittering\r\nstars in the skies of ancient glory, shedding their splendours across all\r\nthe reaches of time. These have fulfilled their dearest hopes in the Abha\r\nParadise; they have tasted the honey of reunion in the congregation of the\r\nLord. Such souls as these profited from their existence here on earth:\r\nthey plucked the fruit of life. As for the rest, 'There surely came upon\r\nthem a time when they were a thing not spoken of.'\r\n\r\nO ye lovers of this wronged one! Cleanse ye your eyes, so that ye behold\r\nno man as different from yourselves. See ye no strangers; rather see all\r\nmen as friends, for love and unity come hard when ye fix your gaze on\r\notherness. And in this new and wondrous age, the Holy Writings say that we\r\nmust be at one with every people; that we must see neither harshness nor\r\ninjustice, neither malevolence, nor hostility, nor hate, but rather turn\r\nour eyes toward the heaven of ancient glory. For each of the creatures is\r\na sign of God, and it was by the grace of the Lord and His power that each\r\ndid step into the world; therefore they are not strangers, but in the\r\nfamily; not aliens, but friends, and to be treated as such.\r\n\r\nWherefore must the loved ones of God associate in affectionate fellowship\r\nwith stranger and friend alike, showing forth to all the utmost\r\nloving-kindness, disregarding the degree of their capacity, never asking\r\nwhether they deserve to be loved. In every instance let the friends be\r\nconsiderate and infinitely kind. Let them never be defeated by the malice\r\nof the people, by their aggression and their hate, no matter how intense.\r\nIf others hurl their darts against you, offer them milk and honey in\r\nreturn; if they poison your lives, sweeten their souls; if they injure\r\nyou, teach them how to be comforted; if they inflict a wound upon you, be\r\na balm to their sores; if they sting you, hold to their lips a refreshing\r\ncup.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! These are Thy feeble servants; they are Thy loyal bondsmen\r\nand Thy handmaidens, who have bowed themselves down before Thine exalted\r\nUtterance and humbled themselves at Thy Threshold of light, and borne\r\nwitness to Thy oneness through which the Sun hath been made to shine in\r\nmidday splendour. They have listened to the summons Thou didst raise from\r\nout Thy hidden Realm, and with hearts quivering with love and rapture,\r\nthey have responded to Thy call.\r\n\r\nO Lord, shower upon them all the outpourings of Thy mercy, rain down upon\r\nthem all the waters of Thy grace. Make them to grow as beauteous plants in\r\nthe garden of heaven, and from the full and brimming clouds of Thy\r\nbestowals and out of the deep pools of Thine abounding grace make Thou\r\nthis garden to flower and keep it ever green and lustrous, ever fresh and\r\nshimmering and fair.\r\n\r\nThou art verily the Mighty, the Exalted, the Powerful, He Who alone, in\r\nthe heavens and on the earth, abideth unchanged. There is none other God\r\nsave Thee, the Lord of manifest tokens and signs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: O THOU WHOSE HEART OVERFLOWETH WITH LOVE FOR THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou whose heart overfloweth with love for the Lord! I address thee from\r\nthis consecrated spot, to gladden thy bosom with mine epistle to thee, for\r\nthis is such a letter as maketh the heart of him who believeth in God's\r\noneness to wing its flight toward the summits of bliss.\r\n\r\nThank thou God for having enabled thee to enter into His Kingdom of might.\r\nErelong will thy Lord's bounties descend upon thee, one following the\r\nother, and He will make of thee a sign for every seeker after truth.\r\n\r\nHold thou fast to the Covenant of thy Lord, and as the days go by,\r\nincrease thy store of love for His beloved ones. Bend thou with tenderness\r\nover the servitors of the All-Merciful, that thou mayest hoist the sail of\r\nlove upon the ark of peace that moveth across the seas of life. Let\r\nnothing grieve thee, and be thou angered at none. It behoveth thee to be\r\ncontent with the Will of God, and a true and loving and trusted friend to\r\nall the peoples of the earth, without any exceptions whatever. This is the\r\nquality of the sincere, the way of the saints, the emblem of those who\r\nbelieve in the unity of God, and the raiment of the people of Baha.\r\n\r\nThank thou and bless thou the Lord for He hath allowed thee to offer Him\r\nthe Right of God.(17) This is verily a special favour on His part, for\r\nthee; praise Him then for this commandment that is set forth in the\r\nScriptures of thy Lord, of Him that is the Ancient of Days.\r\n\r\nVerily is He the Loving, the Tender, the Ever-Bestowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: O THOU DEAR HANDMAID OF GOD! THY LETTER HATH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou dear handmaid of God! Thy letter hath been received and its\r\ncontents noted. Thou didst ask for a rule whereby to guide thy life.\r\n\r\nBelieve thou in God, and keep thine eyes fixed upon the exalted Kingdom;\r\nbe thou enamoured of the Abha Beauty; stand thou firm in the Covenant;\r\nyearn thou to ascend into the Heaven of the Universal Light. Be thou\r\nsevered from this world, and reborn through the sweet scents of holiness\r\nthat blow from the realm of the All-Highest. Be thou a summoner to love,\r\nand be thou kind to all the human race. Love thou the children of men and\r\nshare in their sorrows. Be thou of those who foster peace. Offer thy\r\nfriendship, be worthy of trust. Be thou a balm to every sore, be thou a\r\nmedicine for every ill. Bind thou the souls together. Recite thou the\r\nverses of guidance. Be engaged in the worship of thy Lord, and rise up to\r\nlead the people aright. Loose thy tongue and teach, and let thy face be\r\nbright with the fire of God's love. Rest thou not for a moment, seek thou\r\nto draw no easeful breath. Thus mayest thou become a sign and symbol of\r\nGod's love, and a banner of His grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: SERVICE TO THE FRIENDS IS SERVICE TO THE KINGDOM OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nService to the friends is service to the Kingdom of God, and consideration\r\nshown to the poor is one of the greatest teachings of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: KNOW THOU OF A CERTAINTY THAT LOVE IS THE SECRET OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow thou of a certainty that Love is the secret of God's holy\r\nDispensation, the manifestation of the All-Merciful, the fountain of\r\nspiritual outpourings. Love is heaven's kindly light, the Holy Spirit's\r\neternal breath that vivifieth the human soul. Love is the cause of God's\r\nrevelation unto man, the vital bond inherent, in accordance with the\r\ndivine creation, in the realities of things. Love is the one means that\r\nensureth true felicity both in this world and the next. Love is the light\r\nthat guideth in darkness, the living link that uniteth God with man, that\r\nassureth the progress of every illumined soul. Love is the most great law\r\nthat ruleth this mighty and heavenly cycle, the unique power that bindeth\r\ntogether the divers elements of this material world, the supreme magnetic\r\nforce that directeth the movements of the spheres in the celestial realms.\r\nLove revealeth with unfailing and limitless power the mysteries latent in\r\nthe universe. Love is the spirit of life unto the adorned body of mankind,\r\nthe establisher of true civilization in this mortal world, and the shedder\r\nof imperishable glory upon every high-aiming race and nation.\r\n\r\nWhatsoever people is graciously favoured therewith by God, its name shall\r\nsurely be magnified and extolled by the Concourse from on high, by the\r\ncompany of angels, and the denizens of the Abha Kingdom. And whatsoever\r\npeople turneth its heart away from this Divine Love--the revelation of the\r\nMerciful--shall err grievously, shall fall into despair, and be utterly\r\ndestroyed. That people shall be denied all refuge, shall become even as\r\nthe vilest creatures of the earth, victims of degradation and shame.\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! Strive to become the manifestations of the love\r\nof God, the lamps of divine guidance shining amongst the kindreds of the\r\nearth with the light of love and concord.\r\n\r\nAll hail to the revealers of this glorious light!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: O THOU DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM! THY LETTER DATED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou daughter of the Kingdom! Thy letter dated 5 December 1918 was\r\nreceived. It contained the good news that the friends of God and the\r\nmaidservants of the Merciful have gathered in summer at Green Acre, have\r\nbeen engaged day and night in the commemoration of God, have served the\r\noneness of the world of humanity, have shown love to all religions, have\r\nremained aloof from every religious prejudice and have been kind to all\r\npeople. The divine religions must be the cause of oneness among men, and\r\nthe means of unity and love; they must promulgate universal peace, free\r\nman from every prejudice, bestow joy and gladness, exercise kindness to\r\nall men and do away with every difference and distinction. Just as\r\nBaha'u'llah addressing the world of humanity saith: 'O people! Ye are the\r\nfruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.' At most it is this, that\r\nsome souls are ignorant, they must be educated; some are sick, they must\r\nbe healed; some are still of tender age, they must be helped to attain\r\nmaturity, and the utmost kindness must be shown to them. This is the\r\nconduct of the people of Baha.\r\n\r\nI hope that thy brothers and sisters will all become the well-wishers of\r\nthe world of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14: O YE TWO BLESSED SOULS! YOUR LETTERS WERE RECEIVED. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye two blessed souls! Your letters were received. They showed that ye\r\nhave investigated the truth and have been freed from imitations and\r\nsuperstitions, that ye observe with your own eyes and not with those of\r\nothers, hearken with your own ears and not with the ears of others, and\r\ndiscover mysteries with the help of your own consciences and not with\r\nthose of others. For the imitator saith that such a man hath seen, such a\r\nman hath heard, and such a conscience hath discovered; in other words he\r\ndependeth upon the sight, the hearing and the conscience of others and\r\nhath no will of his own.\r\n\r\nNow, praise be to God, ye have shown will-power and have turned to the Sun\r\nof Truth. The plain of your hearts hath been illumined by the lights of\r\nthe Lord of the Kingdom and ye have been led to the straight path, have\r\nmarched along the road that leadeth to the Kingdom, have entered the Abha\r\nParadise, and have secured a portion and share of the fruit of the Tree of\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nBlessed are ye and a goodly home awaiteth you. Upon you be greetings and\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15: O CAPTIVE OF THE LOVE OF GOD! THE LETTER WHICH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO captive of the love of God! The letter which thou didst write at the\r\ntime of thy departure hath been received. It brought me joy; and it is my\r\nhope that thine inner eye may be opened wide, so that unto thee the very\r\ncore of the divine mysteries may be disclosed.\r\n\r\nThou didst begin thy letter with a blessed phrase, saying: 'I am a\r\nChristian.' O would that all were truly Christian! It is easy to be a\r\nChristian on the tongue, but hard to be a true one. Today some five\r\nhundred million souls are Christian, but the real Christian is very rare:\r\nhe is that soul from whose comely face there shineth the splendour of\r\nChrist, and who showeth forth the perfections of the Kingdom; this is a\r\nmatter of great moment, for to be a Christian is to embody every\r\nexcellence there is. I hope that thou, too, shalt become a true Christian.\r\nPraise thou God that at last, through the divine teachings, thou hast\r\nobtained both sight and insight to the highest degree, and hast become\r\nfirmly rooted in certitude and faith. It is my hope that others as well\r\nwill achieve illumined eyes and hearing ears, and attain to everlasting\r\nlife: that these many rivers, each flowing along in diverse and separated\r\nbeds, will find their way back to the circumambient sea, and merge\r\ntogether and rise up in a single wave of surging oneness; that the unity\r\nof truth, through the power of God, will make these illusory differences\r\nto vanish away. This is the one essential: for if unity be gained, all\r\nother problems will disappear of themselves.\r\n\r\nO honoured lady! In accordance with the divine teachings in this glorious\r\ndispensation we should not belittle anyone and call him ignorant, saying:\r\n'You know not, but I know'. Rather, we should look upon others with\r\nrespect, and when attempting to explain and demonstrate, we should speak\r\nas if we are investigating the truth, saying: 'Here these things are\r\nbefore us. Let us investigate to determine where and in what form the\r\ntruth can be found.' The teacher should not consider himself as learned\r\nand others ignorant. Such a thought breedeth pride, and pride is not\r\nconducive to influence. The teacher should not see in himself any\r\nsuperiority; he should speak with the utmost kindliness, lowliness and\r\nhumility, for such speech exerteth influence and educateth the souls.\r\n\r\nO honoured lady! For a single purpose were the Prophets, each and all,\r\nsent down to earth; for this was Christ made manifest, for this did\r\nBaha'u'llah raise up the call of the Lord: that the world of man should\r\nbecome the world of God, this nether realm the Kingdom, this darkness\r\nlight, this satanic wickedness all the virtues of heaven--and unity,\r\nfellowship and love be won for the whole human race, that the organic\r\nunity should reappear and the bases of discord be destroyed and life\r\neverlasting and grace everlasting become the harvest of mankind.\r\n\r\nO honoured lady! Look about thee at the world: here unity, mutual\r\nattraction, gathering together, engender life, but disunity and inharmony\r\nspell death. When thou dost consider all phenomena, thou wilt see that\r\nevery created thing hath come into being through the mingling of many\r\nelements, and once this collectivity of elements is dissolved, and this\r\nharmony of components is dissevered, the life form is wiped out.\r\n\r\nO honoured lady! In cycles gone by, though harmony was established, yet,\r\nowing to the absence of means, the unity of all mankind could not have\r\nbeen achieved. Continents remained widely divided, nay even among the\r\npeoples of one and the same continent association and interchange of\r\nthought were wellnigh impossible. Consequently intercourse, understanding\r\nand unity amongst all the peoples and kindreds of the earth were\r\nunattainable. In this day, however, means of communication have\r\nmultiplied, and the five continents of the earth have virtually merged\r\ninto one. And for everyone it is now easy to travel to any land, to\r\nassociate and exchange views with its peoples, and to become familiar,\r\nthrough publications, with the conditions, the religious beliefs and the\r\nthoughts of all men. In like manner all the members of the human family,\r\nwhether peoples or governments, cities or villages, have become\r\nincreasingly interdependent. For none is self-sufficiency any longer\r\npossible, inasmuch as political ties unite all peoples and nations, and\r\nthe bonds of trade and industry, of agriculture and education, are being\r\nstrengthened every day. Hence the unity of all mankind can in this day be\r\nachieved. Verily this is none other but one of the wonders of this\r\nwondrous age, this glorious century. Of this past ages have been deprived,\r\nfor this century--the century of light--hath been endowed with unique and\r\nunprecedented glory, power and illumination. Hence the miraculous\r\nunfolding of a fresh marvel every day. Eventually it will be seen how\r\nbright its candles will burn in the assemblage of man.\r\n\r\nBehold how its light is now dawning upon the world's darkened horizon. The\r\nfirst candle is unity in the political realm, the early glimmerings of\r\nwhich can now be discerned. The second candle is unity of thought in world\r\nundertakings, the consummation of which will erelong be witnessed. The\r\nthird candle is unity in freedom which will surely come to pass. The\r\nfourth candle is unity in religion which is the corner-stone of the\r\nfoundation itself, and which, by the power of God, will be revealed in all\r\nits splendour. The fifth candle is the unity of nations--a unity which in\r\nthis century will be securely established, causing all the peoples of the\r\nworld to regard themselves as citizens of one common fatherland. The sixth\r\ncandle is unity of races, making of all that dwell on earth peoples and\r\nkindreds of one race. The seventh candle is unity of language, i.e., the\r\nchoice of a universal tongue in which all peoples will be instructed and\r\nconverse. Each and every one of these will inevitably come to pass,\r\ninasmuch as the power of the Kingdom of God will aid and assist in their\r\nrealization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16: O YE ILLUMINED LOVED ONES AND YE HANDMAIDS OF THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye illumined loved ones and ye handmaids of the Merciful! At a time when\r\nthe sombre night of ignorance, of neglect of the divine world, of being\r\nveiled from God, had overspread the earth, a bright morning dawned and a\r\nrising light lit up the eastern sky. Then rose the Sun of Truth and the\r\nsplendours of the Kingdom were shed over east and west. Those who had eyes\r\nto see rejoiced at the glad tidings and cried out: 'O blessed, blessed are\r\nwe!', and they witnessed the inner reality of all things, and uncovered\r\nthe mysteries of the Kingdom. Delivered then from their fancies and their\r\ndoubts, they beheld the light of truth, and so exhilarated did they become\r\nfrom draining the chalice of God's love, that they utterly forgot the\r\nworld and their own selves. Dancing for joy they hastened to the place of\r\ntheir own martyrdom and there, where men die for love, they flung away\r\ntheir heads and hearts.\r\n\r\nBut those with unseeing eyes were astonished at this tumult, and they\r\ncried, 'Where is the light?' and again, 'We see no light! We see no rising\r\nsun! Here is no truth. This is but fantasy and nothing more.' Bat-like\r\nthey fled into the underground dark, and there, to their way of thinking,\r\nthey found a measure of security and peace.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is but the beginning of the dawn, and the heat of the\r\nrising Orb of Truth is not yet at the fullness of its power. Once the sun\r\nhath mounted to high noon, its fires will burn so hot as to stir even the\r\ncreeping things beneath the earth; and although it is not for them to\r\nbehold the light, yet will they all be set in frenzied motion by the\r\nimpact of the heat.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O ye beloved of God, offer up thanks that ye have, in the day\r\nof the dawning, turned your faces unto the Light of the World and beheld\r\nits splendours. Ye have received a share of the light of truth, ye have\r\nenjoyed a portion of those blessings that endure forever; and therefore,\r\nas a returning of thanks for this bounty, rest ye not for a moment, sit ye\r\nnot silent, carry to men's ears the glad tidings of the Kingdom, spread\r\nfar and wide the Word of God.\r\n\r\nAct in accordance with the counsels of the Lord: that is, rise up in such\r\nwise, and with such qualities, as to endow the body of this world with a\r\nliving soul, and to bring this young child, humanity, to the stage of\r\nadulthood. So far as ye are able, ignite a candle of love in every\r\nmeeting, and with tenderness rejoice and cheer ye every heart. Care for\r\nthe stranger as for one of your own; show to alien souls the same loving\r\nkindness ye bestow upon your faithful friends. Should any come to blows\r\nwith you, seek to be friends with him; should any stab you to the heart,\r\nbe ye a healing salve unto his sores; should any taunt and mock at you,\r\nmeet him with love. Should any heap his blame upon you, praise ye him;\r\nshould he offer you a deadly poison, give him the choicest honey in\r\nexchange; and should he threaten your life, grant him a remedy that will\r\nheal him evermore. Should he be pain itself, be ye his medicine; should he\r\nbe thorns, be ye his roses and sweet herbs. Perchance such ways and words\r\nfrom you will make this darksome world turn bright at last; will make this\r\ndusty earth turn heavenly, this devilish prison place become a royal\r\npalace of the Lord--so that war and strife will pass and be no more, and\r\nlove and trust will pitch their tents on the summits of the world. Such is\r\nthe essence of God's admonitions; such in sum are the teachings for the\r\nDispensation of Baha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17: O YE WHO ARE THE CHOSEN ONES OF THE ABHA KINGDOM! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye who are the chosen ones of the Abha Kingdom! Praise ye the Lord of\r\nHosts for He, riding upon the clouds, hath come down to this world out of\r\nthe heaven of the invisible realm, so that East and West were lit by the\r\nglory of the Sun of Truth, and the call of the Kingdom was raised, and the\r\nheralds of the realm above, with melodies of the Concourse on high, sang\r\nout the glad tidings of the Coming. Then the whole world of being did\r\nquiver for joy, and still the people, even as the Messiah saith, slept on:\r\nfor the day of the Manifestation, when the Lord of Hosts descended, found\r\nthem wrapped in the slumber of unknowing. As He saith in the Gospel, My\r\ncoming is even as when the thief is in the house, and the goodman of the\r\nhouse watcheth not.\r\n\r\nFrom amongst all mankind hath He chosen you, and your eyes have been\r\nopened to the light of guidance and your ears attuned to the music of the\r\nCompany above; and blessed by abounding grace, your hearts and souls have\r\nbeen born into new life. Thank ye and praise ye God that the hand of\r\ninfinite bestowals hath set upon your heads this gem-studded crown, this\r\ncrown whose lustrous jewels will forever flash and sparkle down all the\r\nreaches of time.\r\n\r\nTo thank Him for this, make ye a mighty effort, and choose for yourselves\r\na noble goal. Through the power of faith, obey ye the teachings of God,\r\nand let all your actions conform to His laws. Read ye The Hidden Words,\r\nponder the inner meanings thereof, act in accord therewith. Read, with\r\nclose attention, the Tablets of Tarazat (Ornaments), Kalimat (Words of\r\nParadise), Tajalliyyat (Effulgences), I_sh_raqat (Splendours), and\r\nBi_sh_arat (Glad Tidings), and rise up as ye are bidden in the heavenly\r\nteachings. Thus may each one of you be even as a candle casting its light,\r\nthe centre of attraction wherever people come together; and from you, as\r\nfrom a bed of flowers, may sweet scents be shed.\r\n\r\nRaise ye a clamour like unto a roaring sea; like a prodigal cloud, rain\r\ndown the grace of heaven. Lift up your voices and sing out the songs of\r\nthe Abha Realm. Quench ye the fires of war, lift high the banners of\r\npeace, work for the oneness of humankind and remember that religion is the\r\nchannel of love unto all peoples. Be ye aware that the children of men are\r\nsheep of God and He their loving Shepherd, that He careth tenderly for all\r\nHis sheep and maketh them to feed in His own green pastures of grace and\r\ngiveth them to drink from the wellspring of life. Such is the way of the\r\nLord. Such are His bestowals. Such, from among His teachings, is His\r\nprecept of the oneness of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe portals of His blessings are opened wide and His signs are published\r\nabroad and the glory of truth is blazing forth; inexhaustible are the\r\nblessings. Know ye the value of this time. Strive ye with all your hearts,\r\nraise up your voices and shout, until this dark world be filled with\r\nlight, and this narrow place of shadows be widened out, and this dust heap\r\nof a fleeting moment be changed into a mirror for the eternal gardens of\r\nheaven, and this globe of earth receive its portion of celestial grace.\r\n\r\nThen will aggression crumble away, and all that maketh for disunity be\r\ndestroyed, and the structure of oneness be raised--that the Blessed Tree\r\nmay cast its shade over east and west, and the Tabernacle of the\r\nsingleness of man be set up on the high summits, and flags that betoken\r\nlove and fellowship flutter from their staffs around the world until the\r\nsea of truth lift high its waves, and earth bring forth the roses and\r\nsweet herbs of blessings without end, and become from pole to pole the\r\nAbha Paradise.\r\n\r\nThese are the counsels of 'Abdu'l-Baha. It is my hope that out of the\r\nbestowals of the Lord of Hosts ye will become the spiritual essence and\r\nthe very radiance of humankind, binding the hearts of all with bonds of\r\nlove; that through the power of the Word of God ye will bring to life the\r\ndead now buried in the graves of their sensual desires; that ye will, with\r\nthe rays of the Sun of Truth, restore the sight of those whose inner eye\r\nis blind; that ye will bring spiritual healing to the spiritually sick.\r\nThese things do I hope for, out of the bounties and the bestowals of the\r\nBeloved.\r\n\r\nAt all times do I speak of you and call you to mind. I pray unto the Lord,\r\nand with tears I implore Him to rain down all these blessings upon you,\r\nand gladden your hearts, and make blissful your souls, and grant you\r\nexceeding joy and heavenly delights....\r\n\r\nO Thou loving Provider! These souls have hearkened to the summons of the\r\nKingdom, and have gazed upon the glory of the Sun of Truth. They have\r\nrisen upward to the refreshing skies of love; they are enamoured of Thy\r\nnature, and they worship Thy beauty. Unto Thee have they turned\r\nthemselves, speaking together of Thee, seeking out Thy dwelling, and\r\nthirsting for the waterbrooks of Thy heavenly realm.\r\n\r\nThou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Ever-loving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18: O THOU POSSESSOR OF A SEEING HEART! ALTHOUGH, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou possessor of a seeing heart! Although, materially speaking, thou\r\nart deprived of physical sight, yet, praise be to God, spiritual insight\r\nis thine. Thy heart seeth and thy spirit heareth. Bodily sight is subject\r\nto a thousand maladies and assuredly will ultimately be lost. Thus no\r\nimportance should be attached to it. But the sight of the heart is\r\nillumined. It discerneth and discovereth the divine Kingdom. It is\r\neverlasting and eternal. Praise God, therefore, that the sight of thy\r\nheart is illumined, and the hearing of thy mind responsive.\r\n\r\nEach of the meetings ye have organized, wherein ye feel heavenly emotions\r\nand comprehend realities and significances, is like unto the firmament,\r\nand those souls are as resplendent stars shining with the light of\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\nHappy is the soul that seeketh, in this brilliant era, heavenly teachings,\r\nand blessed is the heart which is stirred and attracted by the love of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19: PRAISE BE TO HIM THROUGH WHOSE SPLENDOURS THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise be to Him through Whose splendours the earth and the heavens are\r\naglow, through Whose fragrant breathings the gardens of holiness that\r\nadorn the hearts of the chosen are trembling for joy, to Him Who hath shed\r\nHis light and brightened the face of the firmament. Verily there appeared\r\nluminous and sparkling stars, glittering, shining out, and casting forth\r\ntheir rays upon the supreme horizon. They derived their grace and\r\nbrilliance from the bounties of the Abha Realm, then, stars of guidance,\r\nthey poured down their lights upon this earth.\r\n\r\nPraise be to Him Who hath fashioned this new era, this age of majesty,\r\neven as an unfolding pageant where the realities of all things can be\r\nexposed to view. Now are clouds of bounty raining down and the gifts of\r\nthe loving Lord are clearly manifest; for both the seen and the unseen\r\nworlds have been illumined, and the Promised One hath come to earth and\r\nthe beauty of the Adored One hath shone forth.\r\n\r\nSalutations, blessings, and welcome to that Universal Reality, that\r\nPerfect Word, that Manifest Book, that Splendour which hath dawned in the\r\nhighest heaven, that Guide of all nations, that Light of the world--the\r\nbillowing ocean of Whose abounding grace hath flooded all creation, in\r\nsuch wise that the waves thereof have cast upon the sands of this visible\r\nworld their shining pearls. Now hath the Truth appeared, and falsehood\r\nfled away; now hath the day dawned and jubilation taken over, wherefore\r\nmen's souls are sanctified, their spirits purged, their hearts rejoiced,\r\ntheir minds purified, their secret thoughts made wholesome, their\r\nconsciences washed clean, their inmost selves made holy: for the Day of\r\nResurrection hath come to pass, and the bestowals of thy Lord, the\r\nForgiving, have encompassed all things. Salutations and praise be unto\r\nthose luminous, resplendent stars that are shedding down their rays from\r\nthe highest heaven, those celestial bodies of the girdling zodiac of the\r\nAbha Realm. May glory rest upon them.\r\n\r\nAnd now, O thou honoured man who hath hearkened unto the Great\r\nAnnouncement, rise up to serve the Cause of God with the resistless power\r\nof the Abha Kingdom and the breaths that blow from the spirit of the\r\nCompany on high. Grieve thou not over what the Pharisees, and the\r\npurveyors of false rumours among writers for the press, are saying of\r\nBaha. Call thou to mind the days of Christ, and the afflictions heaped\r\nupon Him by the people, and all the torments and tribulations inflicted\r\nupon His disciples. Since ye are lovers of the Abha Beauty, ye also must,\r\nfor His love's sake, incur the peoples' blame, and all that befell those\r\nof a former age must likewise befall you. Then will the faces of the\r\nchosen be alight with the splendours of the Kingdom of God, and will shine\r\ndown the ages, yea, down all the cycles of time, while the deniers shall\r\nremain in their manifest loss. It will be even as was said by the Lord\r\nChrist: they shall persecute you for My name's sake.\r\n\r\nRemind them of these words and say unto them: 'Verily did the Pharisees\r\nrise up against Messiah, despite the bright beauty of His face and all His\r\ncomeliness, and they cried out that He was not Messiah [Masih] but a\r\nmonster [Masi_kh_], because He had claimed to be Almighty God, the\r\nsovereign Lord of all, and told them, 'I am God's Son, and verily in the\r\ninmost being of His only Son, His mighty Ward, clearly revealed with all\r\nHis attributes, all His perfections, standeth the Father.' This, they\r\nsaid, was open blasphemy and slander against the Lord according to the\r\nclear and irrefutable texts of the Old Testament. Therefore they passed\r\nthe sentence upon Him, decreeing that His blood be shed, and they hanged\r\nHim on the cross, where He cried out, 'O My beloved Lord, how long wilt\r\nThou abandon Me to them? Lift Me up unto Thee, shelter Me close to Thee,\r\nmake Me a dwelling by Thy throne of glory. Verily art Thou the Answerer of\r\nprayers, and Thou art the Clement, the Merciful. O My Lord! Verily this\r\nworld with all its vastness can no longer contain Me, and I love this\r\ncross, out of love for Thy beauty, and yearning for Thy realm on high, and\r\nbecause of this fire, fanned by the gusts of Thy holiness, aflame within\r\nMy heart. Help me, O Lord, to ascend unto Thee, sustain Me that I may\r\nreach unto Thy sacred Threshold, O My loving Lord! Verily Thou art the\r\nMerciful, the Possessor of great bounty! Verily Thou art the Generous!\r\nVerily Thou art the Compassionate! Verily Thou art the All-Knowing! There\r\nis none other God save Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful!'\r\n\r\nNever would the Pharisees have been emboldened to calumniate Him and\r\ncharge Him with that grievous sin, but for their ignorance of the inner\r\ncore of mysteries and the fact that they paid no heed to His splendours\r\nand regarded not His proofs. Else would they have acknowledged His words,\r\nand borne witness to the verses He revealed, confessed the truth of His\r\nutterances, sought shelter under the protective shadow of His banner,\r\nlearned of His signs and tokens, and rejoiced in His blissful tidings.\r\n\r\nKnow thou that the Divine Essence, which is called the Invisible of the\r\nInvisibles, never to be described, beyond the reach of mind--is sanctified\r\nabove any mention, any definition or hint or allusion, any acclamation or\r\npraise. In the sense that It is that It is, the intellect can never grasp\r\nIt, and the soul seeking knowledge of It is but a wanderer in the desert,\r\nand far astray. 'No vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all vision: He\r\nis the Subtile, the All-Informed.'(18)\r\n\r\nWhen, however, thou dost contemplate the innermost essence of all things,\r\nand the individuality of each, thou wilt behold the signs of thy Lord's\r\nmercy in every created thing, and see the spreading rays of His Names and\r\nAttributes throughout all the realm of being, with evidences which none\r\nwill deny save the froward and the unaware. Then wilt thou observe that\r\nthe universe is a scroll that discloseth His hidden secrets, which are\r\npreserved in the well-guarded Tablet. And not an atom of all the atoms in\r\nexistence, not a creature from amongst the creatures but speaketh His\r\npraise and telleth of His attributes and names, revealeth the glory of His\r\nmight and guideth to His oneness and His mercy: and none will gainsay this\r\nwho hath ears to hear, eyes to see, and a mind that is sound.\r\n\r\nAnd whensoever thou dost gaze upon creation all entire, and dost observe\r\nthe very atoms thereof, thou wilt note that the rays of the Sun of Truth\r\nare shed upon all things and shining within them, and telling of that\r\nDay-Star's splendours, Its mysteries, and the spreading of Its lights.\r\nLook thou upon the trees, upon the blossoms and fruits, even upon the\r\nstones. Here too wilt thou behold the Sun's rays shed upon them, clearly\r\nvisible within them, and manifested by them.\r\n\r\nShouldst thou, however, turn thy gaze unto a Mirror, brilliant, stainless,\r\nand pure, wherein the divine Beauty is reflected, therein wilt thou find\r\nthe Sun shining with Its rays, Its heat, Its disc, Its fair form all\r\nentire. For each separate entity possesseth its allotted portion of the\r\nsolar light and telleth of the Sun, but that Universal Reality in all Its\r\nsplendour, that stainless Mirror Whose qualities are appropriate to the\r\nqualities of the Sun revealed within It--expresseth in their entirety the\r\nattributes of the Source of Glory. And that Universal Reality is Man, the\r\ndivine Being, the Essence that abideth forever. 'Say, Call upon God, or\r\ncall upon the All-Merciful; whichsoever ye call upon, most beauteous are\r\nHis Names.'(19)\r\n\r\nThis is the meaning of the Messiah's words, that the Father is in the\r\nSon.(20) Dost thou not see that should a stainless mirror proclaim,\r\n'Verily is the sun ashine within me, together with all its qualities,\r\ntokens and signs', such an utterance by such a mirror would be neither\r\ndeceptive nor false? No, by the One Who created It, shaped It, fashioned\r\nIt, and made It to be an entity conformable to the attributes of the glory\r\nwithin It! Praised be He Who created It! Praised be He Who fashioned It!\r\nPraised be He Who made It manifest!\r\n\r\nSuch were the words uttered by Christ. On account of these words they\r\ncavilled at and assailed Him when He said unto them, 'Verily the Son is in\r\nthe Father, and the Father is in the Son.'(21) Be thou informed of this,\r\nand learn thou the secrets of thy Lord. As for the deniers, they are\r\nveiled from God: they see not, they hear not, neither do they understand.\r\n'Leave them to entertain themselves with their cavillings.'(22) Abandon\r\nthem to their wanderings along river beds where no stream flows. Like\r\ngrazing beasts they cannot tell paste from pearl. Are they not shut away\r\nfrom the mysteries of thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful?\r\n\r\nFor thy part, rejoice at this best of all glad tidings, and rise up to\r\nexalt the Word of God and to spread abroad His sweet savours in all that\r\nvast and mighty land. Know thou of a certainty that thy Lord will come to\r\nthine aid with a company of the Concourse on high and hosts of the Abha\r\nKingdom. These will mount the attack, and will furiously assail the forces\r\nof the ignorant, the blind. Erelong wilt thou behold the flush of daybreak\r\nspreading from out the Most Exalted Realm, and the morn encompassing all\r\nregions. It will put the dark to flight, and the gloom of night will fade\r\nand pass, and the bright brow of the Faith shine forth, and the Day-Star\r\nrise and overspread the world. On that day will the faithful rejoice, and\r\nthe steadfast be blissful; then will the slanderers take themselves off,\r\nand the waverers be blotted out, even as deepest shadows fall away at the\r\nfirst light of the breaking dawn.\r\n\r\nGreetings be unto thee, and praise.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! This is Thy radiant servant, Thy spiritual thrall, who hath\r\ndrawn nigh unto Thee and approached Thy presence. He hath turned his face\r\nunto Thine, acknowledging Thy oneness, confessing Thy singleness, and he\r\nhath called out in Thy name among the nations, and led the people to the\r\nstreaming waters of Thy mercy, O Thou Most generous Lord! To those who\r\nasked He hath given to drink from the cup of guidance that brimmeth over\r\nwith the wine of Thy measureless grace.\r\n\r\nO Lord, assist him under all conditions, cause him to learn Thy\r\nwell-guarded mysteries, and shower down upon him Thy hidden pearls. Make\r\nof him a banner rippling from castle summits in the winds of Thy heavenly\r\naid, make of him a wellspring of crystal waters.\r\n\r\nO my forgiving Lord! Light up the hearts with the rays of a lamp that\r\nsheddeth abroad its beams, disclosing to those among Thy people whom Thou\r\nhast bounteously favoured, the realities of all things.\r\n\r\nVerily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the Protector, the Strong, the\r\nBeneficent! Verily, Thou art the Lord of all mercies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20: WHEN CHRIST APPEARED, TWENTY CENTURIES AGO, ALTHOUGH ...\r\n\r\n\r\n(23)When Christ appeared, twenty centuries ago, although the Jews were\r\neagerly awaiting His Coming, and prayed every day, with tears, saying: 'O\r\nGod, hasten the Revelation of the Messiah,' yet when the Sun of Truth\r\ndawned, they denied Him and rose against Him with the greatest enmity, and\r\neventually crucified that divine Spirit, the Word of God, and named Him\r\nBeelzebub, the evil one, as is recorded in the Gospel. The reason for this\r\nwas that they said: 'The Revelation of Christ, according to the clear text\r\nof the Torah, will be attested by certain signs, and so long as these\r\nsigns have not appeared, whoso layeth claim to be a Messiah is an\r\nimpostor. Among these signs is this, that the Messiah should come from an\r\nunknown place, yet we all know this man's house in Nazareth, and can any\r\ngood thing come out of Nazareth? The second sign is that He shall rule\r\nwith a rod of iron, that is, He must act with the sword, but this Messiah\r\nhas not even a wooden staff. Another of the conditions and signs is this:\r\nHe must sit upon the throne of David and establish David's sovereignty.\r\nNow, far from being enthroned, this man has not even a mat to sit on.\r\nAnother of the conditions is this: the promulgation of all the laws of the\r\nTorah; yet this man has abrogated these laws, and has even broken the\r\nsabbath day, although it is the clear text of the Torah that whosoever\r\nlayeth claim to prophethood and revealeth miracles and breaketh the\r\nsabbath day, must be put to death. Another of the signs is this, that in\r\nHis reign justice will be so advanced that righteousness and well-doing\r\nwill extend from the human even to the animal world--the snake and the\r\nmouse will share one hole, and the eagle and the partridge one nest, the\r\nlion and the gazelle shall dwell in one pasture, and the wolf and the kid\r\nshall drink from one fountain. Yet now, injustice and tyranny have waxed\r\nso great in His time that they have crucified Him! Another of the\r\nconditions is this, that in the days of the Messiah the Jews will prosper\r\nand triumph over all the peoples of the world, but now they are living in\r\nthe utmost abasement and servitude in the empire of the Romans. Then how\r\ncan this be the Messiah promised in the Torah?'\r\n\r\nIn this wise did they object to that Sun of Truth, although that Spirit of\r\nGod was indeed the One promised in the Torah. But as they did not\r\nunderstand the meaning of these signs, they crucified the Word of God. Now\r\nthe Baha'is hold that the recorded signs did come to pass in the\r\nManifestation of Christ, although not in the sense which the Jews\r\nunderstood, the description in the Torah being allegorical. For instance,\r\namong the signs is that of sovereignty. For Baha'is say that the\r\nsovereignty of Christ was a heavenly, divine, everlasting sovereignty, not\r\na Napoleonic sovereignty that vanisheth in a short time. For well nigh two\r\nthousand years this sovereignty of Christ hath been established, and until\r\nnow it endureth, and to all eternity that Holy Being will be exalted upon\r\nan everlasting throne.\r\n\r\nIn like manner all the other signs have been made manifest, but the Jews\r\ndid not understand. Although nearly twenty centuries have elapsed since\r\nChrist appeared with divine splendour, yet the Jews are still awaiting the\r\ncoming of the Messiah and regard themselves as true and Christ as false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21: O THOU DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGE, THOU SEEKER AFTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou distinguished personage, thou seeker after truth! Thy letter of 4\r\nApril 1921, hath been read with love.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the Divine Being hath been clearly established, on the\r\nbasis of logical proofs, but the reality of the Godhead is beyond the\r\ngrasp of the mind. When thou dost carefully consider this matter, thou\r\nwilt see that a lower plane can never comprehend a higher. The mineral\r\nkingdom, for example, which is lower, is precluded from comprehending the\r\nvegetable kingdom; for the mineral, any such understanding would be\r\nutterly impossible. In the same way, no matter how far the vegetable\r\nkingdom may develop, it will achieve no conception of the animal kingdom,\r\nand any such comprehension at its level would be unthinkable, for the\r\nanimal occupieth a plane higher than that of the vegetable: this tree\r\ncannot conceive of hearing and sight. And the animal kingdom, no matter\r\nhow far it may evolve, can never become aware of the reality of the\r\nintellect, which discovereth the inner essence of all things, and\r\ncomprehendeth those realities which cannot be seen; for the human plane as\r\ncompared with that of the animal is very high. And although these beings\r\nall co-exist in the contingent world, in each case the difference in their\r\nstations precludeth their grasp of the whole; for no lower degree can\r\nunderstand a higher, such comprehension being impossible.\r\n\r\nThe higher plane, however, understandeth the lower. The animal, for\r\ninstance, comprehendeth the mineral and vegetable, the human understandeth\r\nthe planes of the animal, vegetable and mineral. But the mineral cannot\r\npossibly understand the realms of man. And notwithstanding the fact that\r\nall these entities co-exist in the phenomenal world, even so, no lower\r\ndegree can ever comprehend a higher.\r\n\r\nThen how could it be possible for a contingent reality, that is, man, to\r\nunderstand the nature of that pre-existent Essence, the Divine Being? The\r\ndifference in station between man and the Divine Reality is thousands upon\r\nthousands of times greater than the difference between vegetable and\r\nanimal. And that which a human being would conjure up in his mind is but\r\nthe fanciful image of his human condition, it doth not encompass God's\r\nreality but rather is encompassed by it. That is, man graspeth his own\r\nillusory conceptions, but the Reality of Divinity can never be grasped:\r\nIt, Itself, encompasseth all created things, and all created things are in\r\nIts grasp. That Divinity which man doth imagine for himself existeth only\r\nin his mind, not in truth. Man, however, existeth both in his mind and in\r\ntruth; thus man is greater than that fanciful reality which he is able to\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nThe furthermost limits of this bird of clay are these: he can flutter\r\nalong for some short distance, into the endless vast; but he can never\r\nsoar upward to the Sun in the high heavens. We must, nevertheless, set\r\nforth reasoned or inspired proofs as to the existence of the Divine Being,\r\nthat is, proofs commensurate with the understanding of man.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that all created things are connected one to another by a\r\nlinkage complete and perfect, even, for example, as are the members of the\r\nhuman body. Note how all the members and component parts of the human body\r\nare connected one to another. In the same way, all the members of this\r\nendless universe are linked one to another. The foot and the step, for\r\nexample, are connected to the ear and the eye; the eye must look ahead\r\nbefore the step is taken. The ear must hear before the eye will carefully\r\nobserve. And whatever member of the human body is deficient, produceth a\r\ndeficiency in the other members. The brain is connected with the heart and\r\nstomach, the lungs are connected with all the members. So is it with the\r\nother members of the body.\r\n\r\nAnd each one of these members hath its own special function. The mind\r\nforce--whether we call it pre-existent or contingent--doth direct and\r\nco-ordinate all the members of the human body, seeing to it that each part\r\nor member duly performeth its own special function. If, however, there be\r\nsome interruption in the power of the mind, all the members will fail to\r\ncarry out their essential functions, deficiencies will appear in the body\r\nand the functioning of its members, and the power will prove ineffective.\r\n\r\nLikewise, look into this endless universe: a universal power inevitably\r\nexisteth, which encompasseth all, directing and regulating all the parts\r\nof this infinite creation; and were it not for this Director, this\r\nCo-ordinator, the universe would be flawed and deficient. It would be even\r\nas a madman; whereas ye can see that this endless creation carrieth out\r\nits functions in perfect order, every separate part of it performing its\r\nown task with complete reliability, nor is there any flaw to be found in\r\nall its workings. Thus it is clear that a Universal Power existeth,\r\ndirecting and regulating this infinite universe. Every rational mind can\r\ngrasp this fact.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, although all created things grow and develop, yet are they\r\nsubjected to influences from without. For instance, the sun giveth heat,\r\nthe rain nourisheth, the wind bringeth life, so that man can develop and\r\ngrow. Thus it is clear that the human body is under influences from the\r\noutside, and that without those influences man could not grow. And\r\nlikewise, those outside influences are subjected to other influences in\r\ntheir turn. For example, the growth and development of a human being is\r\ndependent upon the existence of water, and water is dependent upon the\r\nexistence of rain, and rain is dependent upon the existence of clouds, and\r\nclouds are dependent upon the existence of the sun, which causeth land and\r\nsea to produce vapour, the condensation of vapour forming the clouds. Thus\r\neach one of these entities exerteth its influence and is likewise\r\ninfluenced in its turn. Inescapably then, the process leadeth to One Who\r\ninfluenceth all, and yet is influenced by none, thus severing the chain.\r\nThe inner reality of that Being, however, is not known, although His\r\neffects are clear and evident.\r\n\r\nAnd further, all created beings are limited, and this very limitation of\r\nall beings proveth the reality of the Limitless; for the existence of a\r\nlimited being denoteth the existence of a Limitless One.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, there are many such proofs, establishing the existence of\r\nthat Universal Reality. And since that Reality is pre-existent, It is\r\nuntouched by the conditions that govern phenomena; for whatever entity is\r\nsubject to circumstances and the play of events is contingent, not\r\npre-existent. Know then: that divinity which other communions and peoples\r\nhave conjured up, falleth within the scope of their imagination, and not\r\nbeyond it, whereas the reality of the Godhead is beyond all conceiving.\r\n\r\nAs to the Holy Manifestations of God, They are the focal points where the\r\nsigns, tokens and perfections of that sacred, pre-existent Reality appear\r\nin all their splendour. They are an eternal grace, a heavenly glory, and\r\non Them dependeth the everlasting life of humankind. To illustrate: the\r\nSun of Truth dwelleth in a sky to which no soul hath any access, and which\r\nno mind can reach, and He is far beyond the comprehension of all\r\ncreatures. Yet the Holy Manifestations of God are even as a looking-glass,\r\nburnished and without stain, which gathereth streams of light out of that\r\nSun, and then scattereth the glory over the rest of creation. In that\r\npolished surface, the Sun with all Its majesty standeth clearly revealed.\r\nThus, should the mirrored Sun proclaim, 'I am the Sun!' this is but truth;\r\nand should It cry, 'I am not the Sun!' this is the truth as well. And\r\nalthough the Day-Star, with all Its glory, Its beauty, Its perfections, be\r\nclearly visible in that mirror without stain, still It hath not come down\r\nfrom Its own lofty station in the realms above, It hath not made Its way\r\ninto the mirror; rather doth It continue to abide, as It will forever, in\r\nthe supernal heights of Its own holiness.\r\n\r\nAnd further, all the earth's creatures require the bounty of the sun, for\r\ntheir very existence is dependent upon solar light and heat. Should they\r\nbe deprived of the sun, they would be wiped out. This is the being with\r\nGod, as referred to in the Holy Books: man must be with his Lord.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the essential reality of God is revealed in His\r\nperfections; and the sun, with its perfections, reflected in a mirror, is\r\na visible thing, an entity clearly expressing the bounty of God.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that thou wilt acquire a perceptive eye, a hearing ear, and\r\nthat the veils will be removed from thy sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22: O THOU WHO ART TURNING THY FACE TOWARDS GOD! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art turning thy face towards God! Close thine eyes to all\r\nthings else, and open them to the realm of the All-Glorious. Ask\r\nwhatsoever thou wishest of Him alone; seek whatsoever thou seekest from\r\nHim alone. With a look He granteth a hundred thousand hopes, with a glance\r\nHe healeth a hundred thousand incurable ills, with a nod He layeth balm on\r\nevery wound, with a glimpse He freeth the hearts from the shackles of\r\ngrief. He doeth as He doeth, and what recourse have we? He carrieth out\r\nHis Will, He ordaineth what He pleaseth. Then better for thee to bow down\r\nthy head in submission, and put thy trust in the All-Merciful Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23: O THOU WHO DOST SEARCH AFTER TRUTH! THY LETTER OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who dost search after truth! Thy letter of 13 December 1920 hath\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Adam until today, the religions of God have been made\r\nmanifest, one following the other, and each one of them fulfilled its due\r\nfunction, revived mankind, and provided education and enlightenment. They\r\nfreed the people from the darkness of the world of nature and ushered them\r\ninto the brightness of the Kingdom. As each succeeding Faith and Law\r\nbecame revealed it remained for some centuries a richly fruitful tree and\r\nto it was committed the happiness of humankind. However, as the centuries\r\nrolled by, it aged, it flourished no more and put forth no fruit,\r\nwherefore was it then made young again.\r\n\r\nThe religion of God is one religion, but it must ever be renewed. Moses,\r\nfor example, was sent forth to man and He established a Law, and the\r\nChildren of Israel, through that Mosaic Law, were delivered out of their\r\nignorance and came into the light; they were lifted up from their\r\nabjectness and attained to a glory that fadeth not. Still, as the long\r\nyears wore on, that radiance passed by, that splendour set, that bright\r\nday turned to night; and once that night grew triply dark, the star of the\r\nMessiah dawned, so that again a glory lit the world.\r\n\r\nOur meaning is this: the religion of God is one, and it is the educator of\r\nhumankind, but still, it needs must be made new. When thou dost plant a\r\ntree, its height increaseth day by day. It putteth forth blossoms and\r\nleaves and luscious fruits. But after a long time, it doth grow old,\r\nyielding no fruitage any more. Then doth the Husbandman of Truth take up\r\nthe seed from that same tree, and plant it in a pure soil; and lo, there\r\nstandeth the first tree, even as it was before.\r\n\r\nNote thou carefully that in this world of being, all things must ever be\r\nmade new. Look at the material world about thee, see how it hath now been\r\nrenewed. The thoughts have changed, the ways of life have been revised,\r\nthe sciences and arts show a new vigour, discoveries and inventions are\r\nnew, perceptions are new. How then could such a vital power as\r\nreligion--the guarantor of mankind's great advances, the very means of\r\nattaining everlasting life, the fosterer of infinite excellence, the light\r\nof both worlds--not be made new? This would be incompatible with the grace\r\nand loving-kindness of the Lord.\r\n\r\nReligion, moreover, is not a series of beliefs, a set of customs; religion\r\nis the teachings of the Lord God, teachings which constitute the very life\r\nof humankind, which urge high thoughts upon the mind, refine the\r\ncharacter, and lay the groundwork for man's everlasting honour.\r\n\r\nNote thou: could these fevers in the world of the mind, these fires of war\r\nand hate, of resentment and malice among the nations, this aggression of\r\npeoples against peoples, which have destroyed the tranquillity of the\r\nwhole world ever be made to abate, except through the living waters of the\r\nteachings of God? No, never!\r\n\r\nAnd this is clear: a power above and beyond the powers of nature must\r\nneeds be brought to bear, to change this black darkness into light, and\r\nthese hatreds and resentments, grudges and spites, these endless wrangles\r\nand wars, into fellowship and love amongst all the peoples of the earth.\r\nThis power is none other than the breathings of the Holy Spirit and the\r\nmighty inflow of the Word of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24: O SPIRITUAL YOUTH! PRAISE THOU GOD THAT THOU HAST ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO spiritual youth! Praise thou God that thou hast found thy way into the\r\nKingdom of Splendours, and hast rent asunder the veil of vain imaginings,\r\nand that the core of the inner mystery hath been made known unto thee.\r\n\r\nThis people, all of them, have pictured a god in the realm of the mind,\r\nand worship that image which they have made for themselves. And yet that\r\nimage is comprehended, the human mind being the comprehender thereof, and\r\ncertainly the comprehender is greater than that which lieth within its\r\ngrasp; for imagination is but the branch, while mind is the root; and\r\ncertainly the root is greater than the branch. Consider then, how all the\r\npeoples of the world are bowing the knee to a fancy of their own\r\ncontriving, how they have created a creator within their own minds, and\r\nthey call it the Fashioner of all that is--whereas in truth it is but an\r\nillusion. Thus are the people worshipping only an error of perception.\r\n\r\nBut that Essence of Essences, that Invisible of Invisibles, is sanctified\r\nabove all human speculation, and never to be overtaken by the mind of man.\r\nNever shall that immemorial Reality lodge within the compass of a\r\ncontingent being. His is another realm, and of that realm no understanding\r\ncan be won. No access can be gained thereto; all entry is forbidden there.\r\nThe utmost one can say is that Its existence can be proved, but the\r\nconditions of Its existence are unknown.\r\n\r\nThat such an Essence doth exist, the philosophers and learned doctors one\r\nand all have understood; but whenever they tried to learn something of Its\r\nbeing, they were left bewildered and dismayed, and at the end, despairing,\r\ntheir hopes in ruins, they went their way, out of this life. For to\r\ncomprehend the state and the inner mystery of that Essence of Essences,\r\nthat Most Secret of Secrets, one needs must have another power and other\r\nfaculties; and such a power, such faculties would be more than humankind\r\ncan bear, wherefore no word of Him can come to them.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, one be endowed with the senses of hearing, of taste, of\r\nsmell, of touch--but be deprived of the sense of sight, it will not be\r\npossible for one to gaze about; for sight cannot be realized through\r\nhearing or tasting, or the sense of smell or touch. In the same way, with\r\nthe faculties at man's disposal it is beyond the realm of possibility for\r\nhim to grasp that unseeable Reality, holy and sanctified above all the\r\nsceptics' doubts. For this, other faculties are required, other senses;\r\nshould such powers become available to him, then could a human being\r\nreceive some knowledge of that world; otherwise, never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25: O THOU HANDMAID OF GOD! IT IS RECORDED IN EASTERN ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou handmaid of God! It is recorded in eastern histories that Socrates\r\njourneyed to Palestine and Syria and there, from men learned in the things\r\nof God, acquired certain spiritual truths; that when he returned to\r\nGreece, he promulgated two beliefs: one, the unity of God, and the other,\r\nthe immortality of the soul after its separation from the body; that these\r\nconcepts, so foreign to their thought, raised a great commotion among the\r\nGreeks, until in the end they gave him poison and killed him.\r\n\r\nAnd this is authentic; for the Greeks believed in many gods, and Socrates\r\nestablished the fact that God is one, which obviously was in conflict with\r\nGreek beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe Founder of monotheism was Abraham; it is to Him that this concept can\r\nbe traced, and the belief was current among the Children of Israel, even\r\nin the days of Socrates.\r\n\r\nThe above, however, cannot be found in the Jewish histories; there are\r\nmany facts which are not included in Jewish history. Not all the events of\r\nthe life of Christ are set forth in the history of Josephus, a Jew,\r\nalthough it was he who wrote the history of the times of Christ. One may\r\nnot, therefore, refuse to believe in events of Christ's day on the grounds\r\nthat they are not to be found in the history of Josephus.\r\n\r\nEastern histories also state that Hippocrates sojourned for a long time in\r\nthe town of Tyre, and this is a city in Syria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26: O THOU WHO SEEKEST THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN! THY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who seekest the Kingdom of Heaven! Thy letter hath been received\r\nand its contents noted.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Manifestations of God possess two stations: one is the physical\r\nstation, and one the spiritual. In other words, one station is that of a\r\nhuman being, and one, of the Divine Reality. If the Manifestations are\r\nsubjected to tests, it is in Their human station only, not in the\r\nsplendour of Their Divine Reality.\r\n\r\nAnd further, these tests are such only from the viewpoint of mankind. That\r\nis, to outward seeming, the human condition of the Holy Manifestations is\r\nsubjected to tests, and when Their strength and endurance have by this\r\nmeans been revealed in the plenitude of power, other men receive\r\ninstruction therefrom, and are made aware of how great must be their own\r\nsteadfastness and endurance under tests and trials. For the Divine\r\nEducator must teach by word and also by deed, thus revealing to all the\r\nstraight pathway of truth.\r\n\r\nAs to my station, it is that of the servant of Baha; 'Abdu'l-Baha, the\r\nvisible expression of servitude to the Threshold of the Abha Beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27: IN CYCLES GONE BY, EACH ONE OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nIn cycles gone by, each one of the Manifestations of God hath had His own\r\nrank in the world of existence, and each hath represented a stage in the\r\ndevelopment of humanity. But the Manifestation of the Most Great Name--may\r\nmy life be a sacrifice for His loved ones--was an expression of the coming\r\nof age, the maturing of man's inmost reality in this world of being. For\r\nthe sun is the source and well-spring of light and heat, the focal point\r\nof splendours, and it compriseth all the perfections that are made\r\nmanifest by the other stars which have dawned upon the world. Make thou an\r\neffort that thou mayest take thy place under the sun and receive an\r\nabundant share of its dazzling light. In truth do I tell thee, once thou\r\nhast attained this station, thou shalt behold the saints bowing down their\r\nheads in all humility before Him. Haste thou to life before death cometh;\r\nhaste thou to the spring season before autumn draweth in; and before\r\nillness striketh, haste thou to healing--that thou mayest become a\r\nphysician of the spirit who, with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, healeth\r\nall manner of sickness in this famed and glorious age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28: O LEAF UPON THE TREE OF LIFE! THE TREE OF LIFE, OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO leaf upon the Tree of Life! The Tree of Life, of which mention is made\r\nin the Bible, is Baha'u'llah, and the daughters of the Kingdom are the\r\nleaves upon that blessed Tree. Then thank thou God that thou hast become\r\nrelated to that Tree, and that thou art flourishing, tender and fresh.\r\n\r\nThe gates of the Kingdom are opened wide, and every favoured soul is\r\nseated at the banquet table of the Lord, receiving his portion of that\r\nheavenly feast. Praised be God, thou too art present at this table, taking\r\nthy share of the bountiful food of heaven. Thou art serving the Kingdom,\r\nand art well acquainted with the sweet savours of the Abha Paradise.\r\n\r\nThen strive thou with all thy might to guide the people, and eat thou of\r\nthe bread that hath come down from heaven. For this is the meaning of\r\nChrist's words: 'I am the living bread which came down from heaven ... he\r\nthat eateth of this bread shall live forever.'(24)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29: O THOU WHO ART CAPTIVATED BY THE TRUTH AND ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art captivated by the truth and magnetized by the Heavenly\r\nKingdom! Thy long letter hath come and it brought great joy, as it clearly\r\nbetokened thy strenuous efforts and high purposes. Praised be God, thou\r\nwishest well to men, and yearnest after the Kingdom of Baha, and art\r\nlonging to see the human race press forward. It is my hope that because of\r\nthese high ideals, these noble intimations of the heart, and these tidings\r\nof heaven, thou shalt become so luminous that down all the ages the light\r\nof thy love for God will shed its glory.\r\n\r\nThou hast described thyself as a student in the school of spiritual\r\nprogress. Fortunate art thou! If these schools of progress lead to the\r\nuniversity of heaven, then branches of knowledge will be developed whereby\r\nhumanity will look upon the tablet of existence as a scroll endlessly\r\nunfolding; and all created things will be seen upon that scroll as letters\r\nand words. Then will the different planes of meaning be learned, and then\r\nwithin every atom of the universe will be witnessed the signs of the\r\noneness of God. Then will man hear the cry of the Lord of the Kingdom, and\r\nbehold the confirmations of the Holy Spirit coming to succour him. Then\r\nwill he feel such bliss, such ecstasy, that the wide world with its\r\nvastness will no longer contain him, and he will set out for the Kingdom\r\nof God, and hurry along to the realm of the spirit. For once a bird hath\r\ngrown its wings, it remaineth on the ground no more, but soareth upward\r\ninto high heaven--except for those birds that are tied by the leg, or those\r\nwhose wings are broken, or mired down.\r\n\r\nO thou seeker after truth! The world of the Kingdom is one world. The only\r\ndifference is that spring returneth over and over again, and setteth up a\r\ngreat new commotion throughout all created things. Then plain and hillside\r\ncome alive, and trees turn delicately green, and leaves, blossoms and\r\nfruits come forth in beauty, infinite and tender. Wherefore the\r\ndispensations of past ages are intimately connected with those that follow\r\nthem: indeed, they are one and the same, but as the world groweth, so doth\r\nthe light, so doth the downpour of heavenly grace, and then the Day-Star\r\nshineth out in noonday splendour.\r\n\r\nO thou seeker after the Kingdom! Every divine Manifestation is the very\r\nlife of the world, and the skilled physician of each ailing soul. The\r\nworld of man is sick, and that competent Physician knoweth the cure,\r\narising as He doth with teachings, counsels and admonishments that are the\r\nremedy for every pain, the healing balm to every wound. It is certain that\r\nthe wise physician can diagnose his patient's needs at any season, and\r\napply the cure. Wherefore, relate thou the Teachings of the Abha Beauty to\r\nthe urgent needs of this present day, and thou wilt see that they provide\r\nan instant remedy for the ailing body of the world. Indeed, they are the\r\nelixir that bringeth eternal health.\r\n\r\nThe treatment ordered by wise physicians of the past, and by those that\r\nfollow after, is not one and the same, rather doth it depend on what\r\naileth the patient; and although the remedy may change, the aim is always\r\nto bring the patient back to health. In the dispensations gone before, the\r\nfeeble body of the world could not withstand a rigorous or powerful cure.\r\nFor this reason did Christ say: 'I have yet many things to say unto you,\r\nmatters needing to be told, but ye cannot bear to hear them now. Howbeit\r\nwhen that Comforting Spirit, Whom the Father will send, shall come, He\r\nwill make plain unto you the truth.'(25)\r\n\r\nTherefore, in this age of splendours, teachings once limited to the few\r\nare made available to all, that the mercy of the Lord may embrace both\r\neast and west, that the oneness of the world of humanity may appear in its\r\nfull beauty, and that the dazzling rays of reality may flood the realm of\r\nthe mind with light.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the New Jerusalem denoteth a heavenly Law, that Law which\r\nis the guarantor of human happiness and the effulgence of the world of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel(26) was indeed the Herald of the Second Coming of Christ, and a\r\nSummoner to the pathway of the Kingdom. It is evident that the Letter is a\r\nmember of the Word, and this membership in the Word signifieth that the\r\nLetter is dependent for its value on the Word, that is, it deriveth its\r\ngrace from the Word; it has a spiritual kinship with the Word, and is\r\naccounted an integral part of the Word. The Apostles were even as Letters,\r\nand Christ was the essence of the Word Itself; and the meaning of the\r\nWord, which is grace everlasting, cast a splendour on those Letters.\r\nAgain, since the Letter is a member of the Word, it therefore, in its\r\ninner meaning, is consonant with the Word.\r\n\r\nIt is our hope that thou wilt in this day arise to promote that which\r\nEmmanuel foretold. Know thou for a certainty that thou wilt succeed in\r\nthis, for the confirmations of the Holy Spirit are continually descending,\r\nand the power of the Word will exert such an influence that the Letter\r\nshall become the mirror in which the splendid Sun--the Word Itself--will be\r\nreflected, and the grace and glory of the Word will illumine the whole\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAs for the heavenly Jerusalem that hath come to rest on the summits of the\r\nworld, and God's Holy of Holies, Whose banner is now lifted high, this\r\ncomprehendeth within itself all the perfections, all the knowledge of the\r\ndispensations gone before. Beyond this, it heraldeth the oneness of the\r\nchildren of men. It is the flag of universal peace, the spirit of eternal\r\nlife; it is the glory of the perfections of God, the circumambient grace\r\nof all existence, the ornament bedecking all created things, the source of\r\ninner quietude for all humankind.\r\n\r\nDirect thine attention to the holy Tablets; read thou the I_sh_raqat,\r\nTajalliyyat, the Words of Paradise, the Glad Tidings, the Tarazat, the\r\nMost Holy Book. Then wilt thou see that today these heavenly Teachings are\r\nthe remedy for a sick and suffering world, and a healing balm for the\r\nsores on the body of mankind. They are the spirit of life, the ark of\r\nsalvation, the magnet to draw down eternal glory, the dynamic power to\r\nmotivate the inner self of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30: EXISTENCE IS OF TWO KINDS: ONE IS THE EXISTENCE OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nExistence is of two kinds: one is the existence of God which is beyond the\r\ncomprehension of man. He, the invisible, the lofty and the\r\nincomprehensible, is preceded by no cause but rather is the Originator of\r\nthe cause of causes. He, the Ancient, hath had no beginning and is the\r\nall-independent. The second kind of existence is the human existence. It\r\nis a common existence, comprehensible to the human mind, is not ancient,\r\nis dependent and hath a cause to it. The mortal substance does not become\r\neternal and vice versa; the human kind does not become a Creator and vice\r\nversa. The transformation of the innate substance is impossible.\r\n\r\nIn the world of existence--that which is comprehensible--there are stages of\r\nmortality: the first stage is the mineral world, next is the vegetable\r\nworld. In the latter world the mineral doth exist but with a distinctive\r\nfeature which is the vegetable characteristic. Likewise in the animal\r\nworld, the mineral and vegetable characteristics are present and in\r\naddition the characteristics of the animal world are to be found, which\r\nare the faculties of hearing and of sight. In the human world the\r\ncharacteristics of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds are found and\r\nin addition that of the human kind, namely the intellectual\r\ncharacteristic, which discovereth the realities of things and\r\ncomprehendeth universal principles.\r\n\r\nMan, therefore, on the plane of the contingent world is the most perfect\r\nbeing. By man is meant the perfect individual, who is like unto a mirror\r\nin which the divine perfections are manifested and reflected. But the sun\r\ndoth not descend from the height of its sanctity to enter into the mirror,\r\nbut when the latter is purified and turned towards the Sun of Truth, the\r\nperfections of this Sun, consisting of light and heat, are reflected and\r\nmanifested in that mirror. These souls are the Divine Manifestations of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31: O THOU WHO ART DEAR, AND WISE! THY LETTER DATED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art dear, and wise! Thy letter dated 27 May 1906 hath been\r\nreceived and its contents are most pleasing and have brought great joy.\r\n\r\nThou didst ask whether this Cause, this new and living Cause, could take\r\nthe place of the dead religious rites and ceremonials of England; whether\r\nit would be possible, now that various groups have appeared, whose members\r\nare highly placed divines and theologians, far superior in their\r\nattainments to those of the past, for this new Cause so to impress the\r\nmembers of such groups as to gather them and the rest into its\r\nall-protecting shade.\r\n\r\nO thou dear friend! Know thou that the distinguished Individual of every\r\nage is endowed according to the perfections of His age. That Individual\r\nwho in past ages was set above His fellows was gifted according to the\r\nvirtues of His time. But in this age of splendours, this era of God, the\r\npre-eminent Personage, the luminous Orb, the chosen Individual will shine\r\nout with such perfections and such power as ultimately to dazzle the minds\r\nof every community and group. And since such a Personage is superior to\r\nall others in spiritual perfections and heavenly attainments, and is\r\nindeed the focal centre of divine blessings and the pivot of the circle of\r\nlight, He will encompass all others, and there is no doubt whatsoever that\r\nHe will shine out with such power as to gather every soul into His\r\nsheltering shade.\r\n\r\nWhen ye consider this matter with care, it will become apparent that this\r\nis according to a universal law, which one can find at work in all things:\r\nthe whole attracteth the part, and in the circle, the centre is the pivot\r\nof the compasses. Ponder thou upon the Spirit(27) : because He was the\r\nfocal centre of spiritual power, the wellspring of divine bounties,\r\nalthough at the beginning He gathered unto Himself only a very few souls,\r\nlater on He was able, because of that all-subduing power that He had, to\r\nunite within the sheltering Tabernacle of Christendom all the differing\r\nsects. Compare the present with the past, and see how great is the\r\ndifference; thus canst thou arrive at truth and certitude.\r\n\r\nThe differences among the religions of the world are due to the varying\r\ntypes of minds. So long as the powers of the mind are various, it is\r\ncertain that men's judgements and opinions will differ one from another.\r\nIf, however, one single, universal perceptive power be introduced--a power\r\nencompassing all the rest--those differing opinions will merge, and a\r\nspiritual harmony and oneness will become apparent. For example, when the\r\nChrist was made manifest, the minds of the various contemporary peoples,\r\ntheir views, their emotional attitudes, whether they were Romans, Greeks,\r\nSyrians, Israelites, or others, were at variance with one another. But\r\nonce His universal power was brought to bear, it gradually succeeded,\r\nafter the lapse of three hundred years, in gathering together all those\r\ndivergent minds under the protection, and within the governance, of one\r\ncentral Point, all sharing the same spiritual emotions in their hearts.\r\n\r\nTo use a metaphor, when an army is placed under various commanders, each\r\nwith his own strategy, they will obviously differ as to battle lines and\r\nmovements of the troops; but once the Supreme Commander, who is thoroughly\r\nversed in the arts of war, taketh over, those other plans will disappear,\r\nfor the supremely gifted general will bring the whole army under his\r\ncontrol. This is intended only as a metaphor, not an exact comparison. Now\r\nif you should say that each and every one of those other generals is\r\nhighly skilled in the military art, is thoroughly proficient and\r\nexperienced, and therefore will not subject himself to the rule of one\r\nindividual, no matter how indescribably great, your statement is\r\nuntenable, for the above situation is demonstrably what cometh to pass,\r\nand there is no doubt thereof whatever.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case with the holy Manifestations of God. Such in particular\r\nis the case with the divine reality of the Most Great Name, the Abha\r\nBeauty. When once He standeth revealed unto the assembled peoples of the\r\nworld and appeareth with such comeliness, such enchantments--alluring as a\r\nJoseph in the Egypt of the spirit--He enslaveth all the lovers on earth.\r\n\r\nAs to those souls who are born into this life as ethereal and radiant\r\nentities and yet, on account of their handicaps and trials, are deprived\r\nof great and real advantages, and leave the world without having lived to\r\nthe full--certainly this is a cause for grieving. This is the reason why\r\nthe universal Manifestations of God unveil Their countenances to man, and\r\nendure every calamity and sore affliction, and lay down Their lives as a\r\nransom; it is to make these very people, the ready ones, the ones who have\r\ncapacity, to become dawning points of light, and to bestow upon them the\r\nlife that fadeth never. This is the true sacrifice: the offering of\r\noneself, even as did Christ, as a ransom for the life of the world.\r\n\r\nAs to the influence of holy Beings and the continuance of Their grace to\r\nmankind after They have put away Their human form, this is, to Baha'is, an\r\nindisputable fact. Indeed, the flooding grace, the streaming splendours of\r\nthe holy Manifestations appear after Their ascension from this world. The\r\nexaltation of the Word, the revelation of the power of God, the conversion\r\nof God-fearing souls, the bestowal of everlasting life--it was following\r\nthe Messiah's martyrdom that all these were increased and intensified. In\r\nthe same way, ever since the ascension of the Blessed Beauty, the\r\nbestowals have been more abundant, the spreading light is brighter, the\r\ntokens of the Lord's might are more powerful, the influence of the Word is\r\nmuch stronger, and it will not be long before the motion, the heat, the\r\nbrilliance, the blessings of the Sun of His reality will encompass all the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nGrieve thou not over the slow advance of the Baha'i Cause in that land.\r\nThis is but the early dawn. Consider how, with the Cause of Christ, three\r\nhundred years had to go by, before its great influence was made manifest.\r\nToday, not sixty years from its birth, the light of this Faith hath been\r\nshed around the planet.\r\n\r\nRegarding the health society of which thou art a member, once it cometh\r\nunder the shelter of this Faith its influence shall increase a\r\nhundredfold.\r\n\r\nThou dost observe that love among the Baha'is is very great, and that love\r\nis the main thing. Just as love's power hath been developed to such a high\r\ndegree among the Baha'is, and is far greater than among the people of\r\nother religions, so is it with all else as well; for love is the ground of\r\nall things.\r\n\r\nRegarding the translation of the Books and Tablets of the Blessed Beauty,\r\nerelong will translations be made into every tongue, with power, clarity\r\nand grace. At such time as they are translated, conformably to the\r\noriginals, and with power and grace of style, the splendours of their\r\ninner meanings will be shed abroad, and will illumine the eyes of all\r\nmankind. Do thy very best to ensure that the translation is in conformity\r\nwith the original.\r\n\r\nThe Blessed Beauty proceeded to Haifa on many occasions. Thou beheldest\r\nHim there, but thou didst not know Him at that time. It is my hope that\r\nthou wilt attain unto the true meeting with Him, which is to behold Him\r\nwith the inner, not the outer eye.\r\n\r\nThe essence of Baha'u'llah's Teaching is all-embracing love, for love\r\nincludeth every excellence of humankind. It causeth every soul to go\r\nforward. It bestoweth on each one, for a heritage, immortal life. Erelong\r\nshalt thou bear witness that His celestial Teachings, the very glory of\r\nreality itself, shall light up the skies of the world.\r\n\r\nThe brief prayer which thou didst write at the close of thy letter was\r\nindeed original, touching and beautiful. Recite thou this prayer at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32: O YE HANDMAIDS OF THE LORD! IN THIS CENTURY--THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye handmaids of the Lord! In this century--the century of the Almighty\r\nLord--the Day-Star of the Realms above, the Light of Truth, shineth in its\r\nmeridian splendour and its rays illuminate all regions. For this is the\r\nage of the Ancient Beauty, the day of the revelation of the might and\r\npower of the Most Great Name--may my life be offered up as a sacrifice for\r\nHis loved ones.\r\n\r\nIn the ages to come, though the Cause of God may rise and grow a\r\nhundredfold and the shade of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha shelter all mankind,\r\nyet this present century shall stand unrivalled, for it hath witnessed the\r\nbreaking of that Morn and the rising of that Sun. This century is, verily,\r\nthe source of His Light and the dayspring of His Revelation. Future ages\r\nand generations shall behold the diffusion of its radiance and the\r\nmanifestations of its signs.\r\n\r\nWherefore, exert yourselves, haply ye may obtain your full share and\r\nportion of His bestowals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33: O SERVANT OF GOD! WE HAVE NOTED WHAT THOU DIDST ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO servant of God! We have noted what thou didst write to\r\nJinab-i-Ibn-'Abhar, and thy question regarding the verse: 'Whoso layeth\r\nclaim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the expiration of a full\r\nthousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor.'\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this is that any individual who, before the expiry of a\r\nfull thousand years--years known and clearly established by common usage\r\nand requiring no interpretation--should lay claim to a Revelation direct\r\nfrom God, even though he should reveal certain signs, that man is\r\nassuredly false and an impostor.\r\n\r\nThis is not a reference to the Universal Manifestation, for it is clearly\r\nset forth in the Holy Writings that centuries, nay thousands of years,\r\nmust pass on to completion, before a Manifestation like unto this\r\nManifestation shall appear again.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that after the completion of a full thousand\r\nyears, certain Holy Beings will be empowered to deliver a Revelation:\r\nthis, however, will not be through a Universal Manifestation. Wherefore\r\nevery day of the cycle of the Blessed Beauty is in reality equal to one\r\nyear, and every year of it is equal to a thousand years.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, the sun: its transit from one zodiacal sign to the\r\nnext occurreth within a short period of time, yet only after a long period\r\ndoth it attain the plenitude of its resplendency, its heat and glory, in\r\nthe sign of Leo. It must first complete one full revolution through the\r\nother constellations before it will enter the sign of Leo again, to blaze\r\nout in its full splendour. In its other stations, it revealeth not the\r\nfullness of its heat and light.\r\n\r\nThe substance is, that prior to the completion of a thousand years, no\r\nindividual may presume to breathe a word. All must consider themselves to\r\nbe of the order of subjects, submissive and obedient to the commandments\r\nof God and the laws of the House of Justice. Should any deviate by so much\r\nas a needle's point from the decrees of the Universal House of Justice, or\r\nfalter in his compliance therewith, then is he of the outcast and\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nAs to the cycle of the Blessed Beauty--the times of the Greatest Name--this\r\nis not limited to a thousand or two thousand years....\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that the period of a thousand years beginneth with the\r\nManifestation of the Blessed Beauty and every day thereof is a thousand\r\nyears, the intent is a reference to the cycle of the Blessed Beauty, which\r\nin this context will extend over many ages into the unborn reaches of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34: O THOU WHO ART SERVING THE WORLD OF HUMANITY! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art serving the world of humanity! Thy letter was received and\r\nfrom its contents we felt exceedingly glad. It was a decisive proof and a\r\nbrilliant evidence. It is appropriate and befitting that in this illumined\r\nage--the age of the progress of the world of humanity--we should be\r\nself-sacrificing and should serve the human race. Every universal cause is\r\ndivine and every particular one is temporal. The principles of the divine\r\nManifestations of God were, therefore, all-universal and all-inclusive.\r\n\r\nEvery imperfect soul is self-centred and thinketh only of his own good.\r\nBut as his thoughts expand a little he will begin to think of the welfare\r\nand comfort of his family. If his ideas still more widen, his concern will\r\nbe the felicity of his fellow citizens; and if still they widen, he will\r\nbe thinking of the glory of his land and of his race. But when ideas and\r\nviews reach the utmost degree of expansion and attain the stage of\r\nperfection, then will he be interested in the exaltation of humankind. He\r\nwill then be the well-wisher of all men and the seeker of the weal and\r\nprosperity of all lands. This is indicative of perfection.\r\n\r\nThus, the divine Manifestations of God had a universal and all-inclusive\r\nconception. They endeavoured for the sake of everyone's life and engaged\r\nin the service of universal education. The area of their aims was not\r\nlimited--nay, rather, it was wide and all-inclusive.\r\n\r\nTherefore, ye must also be thinking of everyone, so that mankind may be\r\neducated, character moderated and this world may turn into a Garden of\r\nEden.\r\n\r\nLove ye all religions and all races with a love that is true and sincere\r\nand show that love through deeds and not through the tongue; for the\r\nlatter hath no importance, as the majority of men are, in speech,\r\nwell-wishers, while action is the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35: O ARMY OF GOD! A LETTER SIGNED JOINTLY BY ALL OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO army of God! A letter signed jointly by all of you hath been received.\r\nIt was most eloquent and full of flavour, and reading it was a delight.\r\n\r\nYe had written of the fasting month. Fortunate are ye to have obeyed the\r\ncommandment of God, and kept this fast during the holy season. For this\r\nmaterial fast is an outer token of the spiritual fast; it is a symbol of\r\nself-restraint, the withholding of oneself from all appetites of the self,\r\ntaking on the characteristics of the spirit, being carried away by the\r\nbreathings of heaven and catching fire from the love of God.\r\n\r\nYour letter also betokened your unity and the closeness of your hearts. It\r\nis my hope that the west, through the boundless grace that God is pouring\r\ndown in this new era, will become the east, the dawning-point of the Sun\r\nof Truth, and western believers the daysprings of light, and manifestors\r\nof the signs of God; that they will be guarded from the doubts of the\r\nheedless and will stay firm and unmoveable in the Covenant and Testament;\r\nthat they will toil by day and by night until they awaken those who sleep,\r\nand make mindful those who are unaware, and bring in the outcast to be\r\nintimates of the inner circle, and bestow upon the destitute their portion\r\nof eternal grace. Let them be heralds of the Kingdom, and call out to the\r\ndenizens of this nether world, and summon them to enter the realm on high.\r\n\r\nO army of God! Today, in this world, every people is wandering astray in\r\nits own desert, moving here and there according to the dictates of its\r\nfancies and whims, pursuing its own particular caprice. Amongst all the\r\nteeming masses of the earth, only this community of the Most Great Name is\r\nfree and clear of human schemes and hath no selfish purpose to promote.\r\nAlone amongst them all, this people hath arisen with aims purified of\r\nself, following the Teachings of God, most eagerly toiling and striving\r\ntoward a single goal: to turn this nether dust into high heaven, to make\r\nof this world a mirror for the Kingdom, to change this world into a\r\ndifferent world, and cause all humankind to adopt the ways of\r\nrighteousness and a new manner of life.\r\n\r\nO army of God! Through the protection and help vouchsafed by the Blessed\r\nBeauty--may my life be a sacrifice to His loved ones--ye must conduct\r\nyourselves in such a manner that ye may stand out distinguished and\r\nbrilliant as the sun among other souls. Should any one of you enter a\r\ncity, he should become a centre of attraction by reason of his sincerity,\r\nhis faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, his truthfulness and\r\nloving-kindness towards all the peoples of the world, so that the people\r\nof that city may cry out and say: 'This man is unquestionably a Baha'i,\r\nfor his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, his morals, his nature, and\r\ndisposition reflect the attributes of the Baha'is.' Not until ye attain\r\nthis station can ye be said to have been faithful to the Covenant and\r\nTestament of God. For He hath, through irrefutable Texts, entered into a\r\nbinding Covenant with us all, requiring us to act in accordance with His\r\nsacred instructions and counsels.\r\n\r\nO army of God! The time hath come for the effects and perfections of the\r\nMost Great Name to be made manifest in this excellent age, so as to\r\nestablish, beyond any doubt, that this era is the era of Baha'u'llah, and\r\nthis age is distinguished above all other ages.\r\n\r\nO army of God! Whensoever ye behold a person whose entire attention is\r\ndirected toward the Cause of God; whose only aim is this, to make the Word\r\nof God to take effect; who, day and night, with pure intent, is rendering\r\nservice to the Cause; from whose behaviour not the slightest trace of\r\negotism or private motives is discerned--who, rather, wandereth distracted\r\nin the wilderness of the love of God, and drinketh only from the cup of\r\nthe knowledge of God, and is utterly engrossed in spreading the sweet\r\nsavours of God, and is enamoured of the holy verses of the Kingdom of\r\nGod--know ye for a certainty that this individual will be supported and\r\nreinforced by heaven; that like unto the morning star, he will forever\r\ngleam brightly out of the skies of eternal grace. But if he show the\r\nslightest taint of selfish desires and self love, his efforts will lead to\r\nnothing and he will be destroyed and left hopeless at the last.\r\n\r\nO army of God! Praise be to God, Baha'u'llah hath lifted the chains from\r\noff the necks of humankind, and hath set man free from all that trammelled\r\nhim, and told him: Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one\r\nbranch; be ye compassionate and kind to all the human race. Deal ye with\r\nstrangers the same as with friends, cherish ye others just as ye would\r\nyour own. See foes as friends; see demons as angels; give to the tyrant\r\nthe same great love ye show the loyal and true, and even as gazelles from\r\nthe scented cities of _Kh_ata and _Kh_utan(28) offer up sweet musk to the\r\nravening wolf. Be ye a refuge to the fearful; bring ye rest and peace to\r\nthe disturbed; make ye a provision for the destitute; be a treasury of\r\nriches for the poor; be a healing medicine for those who suffer pain; be\r\nye doctor and nurse to the ailing; promote ye friendship, and honour, and\r\nconciliation, and devotion to God, in this world of non-existence.\r\n\r\nO army of God! Make ye a mighty effort: perchance ye can flood this earth\r\nwith light, that this mud hut, the world, may become the Abha Paradise.\r\nThe dark hath taken over, and the brute traits prevail. This world of man\r\nis now an arena for wild beasts, a field where the ignorant, the heedless,\r\nseize their chance. The souls of men are ravening wolves and animals with\r\nblinded eyes, they are either deadly poison or useless weeds--all except\r\nfor a very few who indeed do nurture altruistic aims and plans for the\r\nwell-being of their fellow men: but ye must in this matter--that is, the\r\nserving of humankind--lay down your very lives, and as ye yield yourselves,\r\nrejoice.\r\n\r\nO army of God! The Exalted One, the Bab, gave up His life. The Blessed\r\nPerfection gave up a hundred lives at every breath. He bore calamities. He\r\nsuffered anguish. He was imprisoned. He was chained. He was made homeless\r\nand was banished to distant lands. Finally, then, He lived out His days in\r\nthe Most Great Prison. Likewise, a great multitude of the lovers of God\r\nwho followed this path have tasted the honey of martyrdom and they gave up\r\neverything--life, possessions, kindred--all they had. How many homes were\r\nreduced to rubble; how many dwellings were broken into and pillaged; how\r\nmany a noble building went to the ground; how many a palace was battered\r\ninto a tomb. And all this came about that humankind might be illumined,\r\nthat ignorance might yield to knowledge, that men of earth might become\r\nmen of heaven, that discord and dissension might be torn out by the roots,\r\nand the Kingdom of Peace become established over all the world. Strive ye\r\nnow that this bounty become manifest, and this best-beloved of all hopes\r\nbe realized in splendour throughout the community of man.\r\n\r\nO army of God! Beware lest ye harm any soul, or make any heart to sorrow;\r\nlest ye wound any man with your words, be he known to you or a stranger,\r\nbe he friend or foe. Pray ye for all; ask ye that all be blessed, all be\r\nforgiven. Beware, beware, lest any of you seek vengeance, even against one\r\nwho is thirsting for your blood. Beware, beware, lest ye offend the\r\nfeelings of another, even though he be an evil-doer, and he wish you ill.\r\nLook ye not upon the creatures, turn ye to their Creator. See ye not the\r\nnever-yielding people, see but the Lord of Hosts. Gaze ye not down upon\r\nthe dust, gaze upward at the shining sun, which hath caused every patch of\r\ndarksome earth to glow with light.\r\n\r\nO army of God! When calamity striketh, be ye patient and composed. However\r\nafflictive your sufferings may be, stay ye undisturbed, and with perfect\r\nconfidence in the abounding grace of God, brave ye the tempest of\r\ntribulations and fiery ordeals.\r\n\r\nLast year a number of the unfaithful, both from within and from without,\r\nboth known to us and strangers, took before the Sultan of Turkey\r\nslanderous charges against these homeless exiles, bringing against us\r\ngrave accusations with no basis in fact. The Government, conformably with\r\nprudence, determined to look into these charges, and dispatched a\r\nCommission of Investigation to this city. It is obvious what an\r\nopportunity this afforded our ill-wishers, and what a storm they\r\nunleashed, all this beyond description by tongue or pen. Only one who\r\nwitnessed it could know what a turmoil they created and what an earthquake\r\nof anguish was the result. And notwithstanding this, the response was to\r\ndepend utterly upon God, and to remain composed, confident,\r\nlong-suffering, undisturbed, to such a degree that a person knowing\r\nnothing of the situation would have thought us easy of heart and mind,\r\nperfectly happy, thriving and at peace.\r\n\r\nThen it came about that the accusers themselves, those who had made the\r\ndefamatory charges against us, joined with the members of the Commission\r\nto investigate the accusations, so that plaintiffs, witnesses and judge\r\nwere all one and the same, and the conclusion was foregone. Nevertheless,\r\nto be fair, it must be stated that up to now His Majesty the Sultan of\r\nTurkey hath paid no heed to these false charges, this defamation, these\r\nfables and traducements, and hath acted with justice....\r\n\r\nO Thou Provider! Thou hast breathed over the friends in the West the sweet\r\nfragrance of the Holy Spirit, and with the light of divine guidance Thou\r\nhast lit up the western sky. Thou hast made those who were once remote to\r\ndraw near unto Thyself; Thou hast turned strangers into loving friends;\r\nThou hast awakened those who slept; Thou hast made the heedless mindful.\r\n\r\nO Thou Provider! Assist Thou these noble friends to win Thy good pleasure,\r\nand make them well-wishers of stranger and friend alike. Bring them into\r\nthe world that abideth forever; grant them a portion of heavenly grace;\r\ncause them to be true Baha'is, sincerely of God; save them from outward\r\nsemblances, and establish them firmly in the truth. Make them signs and\r\ntokens of the Kingdom, luminous stars above the horizons of this nether\r\nlife. Make them to be a comfort and a solace to humankind and servants to\r\nthe peace of the world. Exhilarate them with the wine of Thy counsel, and\r\ngrant that all of them may tread the path of Thy commandments.\r\n\r\nO Thou Provider! The dearest wish of this servant of Thy Threshold is to\r\nbehold the friends of east and west in close embrace; to see all the\r\nmembers of human society gathered with love in a single great assemblage,\r\neven as individual drops of water collected in one mighty sea; to behold\r\nthem all as birds in one garden of roses, as pearls of one ocean, as\r\nleaves of one tree, as rays of one sun.\r\n\r\nThou art the Mighty, the Powerful, and Thou art the God of strength, the\r\nOmnipotent, the All-Seeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36: O YE TWO FAVOURED HANDMAIDS OF THE LORD! THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye two favoured handmaids of the Lord! The letter from Mother Beecher\r\nhath been received, and truly it spoke for you both, wherefore I address\r\nthe two of you together. This seemeth very good to me, for ye two pure\r\nbeings are even as a single precious gem, ye are two boughs branched from\r\na single tree; ye both adore the same Beloved, ye both are longing for the\r\nsame resplendent Sun.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that all the handmaids of God in that region will unite like\r\nunto the waves of one unending sea; for although blown about as the wind\r\nlisteth, these are separate in themselves, yet in truth are they all at\r\none with the boundless deep.\r\n\r\nHow good it is if the friends be as close as sheaves of light, if they\r\nstand together side by side in a firm unbroken line. For now have the rays\r\nof reality from the Sun of the world of existence, united in adoration all\r\nthe worshippers of this light; and these rays have, through infinite\r\ngrace, gathered all peoples together within this wide-spreading shelter;\r\ntherefore must all souls become as one soul, and all hearts as one heart.\r\nLet all be set free from the multiple identities that were born of passion\r\nand desire, and in the oneness of their love for God find a new way of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nO ye two handmaids of God! Now is the time for you to become as bounteous\r\ncups that are filled to overflowing, and even as the reviving gusts that\r\nblow from the Abha Paradise, to scatter the fragrance of musk across that\r\nland. Release yourselves from this world's life, and at every stage long\r\nye for non-existence; for when the ray returneth to the sun, it is wiped\r\nout, and when the drop cometh to the sea, it vanisheth, and when the true\r\nlover findeth his Beloved, he yieldeth up his soul.\r\n\r\nUntil a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of\r\nevery favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying\r\nto the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The\r\nmartyr's field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of\r\neternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self,\r\nand bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have\r\nreached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your\r\nshadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest\r\nsovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the\r\nlast but manifest perdition and great loss.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, the gate of boundless grace is opened wide, the heavenly\r\ntable is set, the servants of the Merciful and His handmaids are present\r\nat the feast. Strive ye to receive your share of this eternal food, so\r\nthat ye shall be loved and cherished in this world and the next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37: O YE DEAR FRIENDS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! A BLESSED LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye dear friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha! A blessed letter hath been received\r\nfrom you, telling of the election of a Spiritual Assembly. It hath\r\nrejoiced my heart to know that, God be praised, the friends in that area,\r\nwith absolute unity, fellowship and love, have held this new election and\r\nwere successful in voting for souls who are sanctified, are favoured at\r\nthe Holy Threshold and are well known amongst the friends to be staunch\r\nand firm in the Covenant.\r\n\r\nNow must those elected representatives arise to serve with spirituality\r\nand joy, with purity of intent, with strong attraction to the fragrances\r\nof the Almighty, and well supported by the Holy Spirit. Let them raise up\r\nthe banner of guidance, and as soldiers of the Company on high, let them\r\nexalt God's Word, spread abroad His sweet savours, educate the souls of\r\nmen, and promote the Most Great Peace.\r\n\r\nTruly, blessed souls have been elected. The moment I read their names, I\r\nfelt a thrill of spiritual joy to know that, praised be God, persons have\r\nbeen raised up in that country who are servants of the Kingdom, and ready\r\nto lay down their lives for Him Who hath neither likeness nor peer.\r\n\r\nO ye dear friends of mine! Light up this Assembly with the splendour of\r\nGod's love. Make it ring out with the joyous music of the hallowed\r\nspheres, make it thrive on those foods that are served at the Lord's\r\nSupper, at the heavenly banquet table of God. Come ye together in gladness\r\nunalloyed, and at the beginning of the meeting, recite ye this prayer:\r\n\r\nO Thou Lord of the Kingdom! Though our bodies be gathered here together,\r\nyet our spellbound hearts are carried away by Thy love, and yet are we\r\ntransported by the rays of Thy resplendent face. Weak though we be, we\r\nawait the revelations of Thy might and power. Poor though we be, with\r\nneither goods nor means, still take we riches from the treasures of Thy\r\nKingdom. Drops though we be, still do we draw from out Thy ocean deeps.\r\nMotes though we be, still do we gleam in the glory of Thy splendid Sun.\r\n\r\nO Thou our Provider! Send down Thine aid, that each one gathered here may\r\nbecome a lighted candle, each one a centre of attraction, each one a\r\nsummoner to Thy heavenly realms, till at last we make this nether world\r\nthe mirror image of Thy Paradise.\r\n\r\nO ye dear friends of mine! It is incumbent upon the assemblies of those\r\nregions to be connected one with another and to correspond with one\r\nanother, and also to communicate with the assemblies of the east, thus to\r\nbecome agencies for union throughout the world.\r\n\r\nO ye spiritual friends! Such must be your constancy that should the\r\nevil-wishers put every believer to death and only one remain, that one,\r\nsingly and alone, will withstand all the peoples of the earth, and will go\r\non scattering far and wide the sweet and holy fragrances of God.\r\nWherefore, should any fearsome news, any word of terrifying events, reach\r\nyou from the Holy Land, see to it that ye waver not, be ye not stricken by\r\ngrief, be ye not shaken. Rather, rise ye up instantly, with iron resolve,\r\nand serve ye the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nThis Servant of the Lord's Threshold hath been in peril at all times. He\r\nis in peril now. At no time have I had any hope of safety, and my dearest\r\nwish is this: to drink of the martyr's bounteous and brim-full cup, and\r\ndie on the field of sacrifice, delighting in that wine which is the most\r\nprecious of God's gifts. This is my highest hope, this my most vehement\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nWe hear that the Tablets of I_sh_raqat (Splendours), Tarazat (Ornaments),\r\nBi_sh_arat (Glad Tidings), Tajalliyyat (Effulgences), and Kalimat (Words\r\nof Paradise) have been translated and published in those regions. In these\r\nTablets will ye have a model of how to be and how to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38: O HANDMAID OF GOD, WHO TREMBLEST EVEN AS A FRESH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God, who tremblest even as a fresh and tender branch in the\r\nwinds of the love of God! I have read thy letter, which telleth of thine\r\nabundant love, thine intense devotion, and of thy being occupied with the\r\nremembrance of thy Lord.\r\n\r\nDepend thou upon God. Forsake thine own will and cling to His, set aside\r\nthine own desires and lay hold of His, that thou mayest become an example,\r\nholy, spiritual, and of the Kingdom, unto His handmaids.\r\n\r\nKnow thou, O handmaid, that in the sight of Baha, women are accounted the\r\nsame as men, and God hath created all humankind in His own image, and\r\nafter His own likeness. That is, men and women alike are the revealers of\r\nHis names and attributes, and from the spiritual viewpoint there is no\r\ndifference between them. Whosoever draweth nearer to God, that one is the\r\nmost favoured, whether man or woman. How many a handmaid, ardent and\r\ndevoted, hath, within the sheltering shade of Baha, proved superior to the\r\nmen, and surpassed the famous of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe House of Justice, however, according to the explicit text of the Law\r\nof God, is confined to men; this for a wisdom of the Lord God's, which\r\nwill erelong be made manifest as clearly as the sun at high noon.\r\n\r\nAs to you, O ye other handmaids who are enamoured of the heavenly\r\nfragrances, arrange ye holy gatherings, and found ye Spiritual Assemblies,\r\nfor these are the basis for spreading the sweet savours of God, exalting\r\nHis Word, uplifting the lamp of His grace, promulgating His religion and\r\npromoting His Teachings, and what bounty is there greater than this? These\r\nSpiritual Assemblies are aided by the Spirit of God. Their defender is\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha. Over them He spreadeth His wings. What bounty is there\r\ngreater than this? These Spiritual Assemblies are shining lamps and\r\nheavenly gardens, from which the fragrances of holiness are diffused over\r\nall regions, and the lights of knowledge are shed abroad over all created\r\nthings. From them the spirit of life streameth in every direction. They,\r\nindeed, are the potent sources of the progress of man, at all times and\r\nunder all conditions. What bounty is there greater than this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39: O HANDMAID OF GOD! THY LETTER HATH BEEN RECEIVED, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! Thy letter hath been received, bringing its news that\r\nan Assembly hath been established in that city.\r\n\r\nLook ye not upon the fewness of thy numbers, rather, seek ye out hearts\r\nthat are pure. One consecrated soul is preferable to a thousand other\r\nsouls. If a small number of people gather lovingly together, with absolute\r\npurity and sanctity, with their hearts free of the world, experiencing the\r\nemotions of the Kingdom and the powerful magnetic forces of the Divine,\r\nand being at one in their happy fellowship, that gathering will exert its\r\ninfluence over all the earth. The nature of that band of people, the words\r\nthey speak, the deeds they do, will unleash the bestowals of Heaven, and\r\nprovide a foretaste of eternal bliss. The hosts of the Company on high\r\nwill defend them, and the angels of the Abha Paradise, in continuous\r\nsuccession, will come down to their aid.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of 'angels' is the confirmations of God and His celestial\r\npowers. Likewise angels are blessed beings who have severed all ties with\r\nthis nether world, have been released from the chains of self and the\r\ndesires of the flesh, and anchored their hearts to the heavenly realms of\r\nthe Lord. These are of the Kingdom, heavenly; these are of God, spiritual;\r\nthese are revealers of God's abounding grace; these are dawning-points of\r\nHis spiritual bestowals.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! Praise be to Him, thy dear husband hath perceived the\r\nsweet scents that blow from the gardens of heaven. Now, as day followeth\r\nday, must thou, through the love of God, and thine own good actions, draw\r\nhim ever closer to the Faith.\r\n\r\nThose were indeed dire events in San Francisco.(29) Disasters of this kind\r\nshould serve to awaken the people, and diminish the love of their hearts\r\nfor this inconstant world. It is in this nether world that such tragic\r\nthings take place: this is the cup that yieldeth bitter wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40: O YE WHOM 'ABDU'L-BAHA LOVETH! I HAVE READ YOUR ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye whom 'Abdu'l-Baha loveth! I have read your reports with great joy;\r\nthey are of a nature to cheer and refresh the heart and gladden the soul.\r\nIf this Assembly, through the holy breathings of the All-Merciful and His\r\ndivine confirmations, endure and remain fixed and firm, it shall produce\r\nnotable results and it shall succeed in enterprises of great moment.\r\n\r\nThe Spiritual Assemblies to be established in this Age of God, this holy\r\ncentury, have, it is indisputable, had neither peer nor likeness in the\r\ncycles gone before. For those assemblages that wielded power were based on\r\nthe support of mighty leaders of men, while these Assemblies are based on\r\nthe support of the Beauty of Abha. The defenders and patrons of those\r\nother assemblages were either a prince, or a king, or a chief priest, or\r\nthe mass of the people. But these Spiritual Assemblies have for their\r\ndefender, their supporter, their helper, their inspirer, the omnipotent\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nLook ye not upon the present, fix your gaze upon the times to come. In the\r\nbeginning, how small is the seed, yet in the end it is a mighty tree. Look\r\nye not upon the seed, look ye upon the tree, and its blossoms, and its\r\nleaves and its fruits. Consider the days of Christ, when none but a small\r\nband followed Him; then observe what a mighty tree that seed became,\r\nbehold ye its fruitage. And now shall come to pass even greater things\r\nthan these, for this is the summons of the Lord of Hosts, this is the\r\ntrumpet-call of the living Lord, this is the anthem of world peace, this\r\nis the standard of righteousness and trust and understanding raised up\r\namong all the variegated peoples of the globe; this is the splendour of\r\nthe Sun of Truth, this is the holiness of the spirit of God Himself. This\r\nmost powerful of dispensations will encompass all the earth, and beneath\r\nits banner will all peoples gather and be sheltered together. Know then\r\nthe vital import of this tiny seed that the true Husbandman hath, with the\r\nhands of His mercy, sown in the ploughed fields of the Lord, and watered\r\nwith the rain of bestowals and bounties and is now nurturing in the heat\r\nand light of the Day-Star of Truth.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O ye loved ones of God, offer up thanks unto Him, since He hath\r\nmade you the object of such bounties, and the recipients of such gifts.\r\nBlessed are ye, glad tidings to you, for this abounding grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41: O THOU WHO ART STEADFAST IN THE COVENANT, AND ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art steadfast in the Covenant, and staunch! The letter which\r\nthou didst write ... hath been shown to me, and the opinions expressed\r\ntherein were most commendable. It is incumbent upon the Spiritual\r\nConsultative Assembly of New York to be in complete agreement with that of\r\nChicago, and for these two assemblies of consultation jointly to approve\r\nwhatever they consider suitable for publication and distribution.\r\nFollowing that, let them send one copy to Akka, so that it may also be\r\napproved from here, after which the material will be returned to be\r\npublished and circulated.\r\n\r\nThe question of co-ordinating and unifying the two Spiritual Assemblies,\r\nthat of Chicago and of New York, is of the utmost importance, and once a\r\nSpiritual Assembly is duly formed in Washington, these two Assemblies\r\nshould also establish ties of unity with that Assembly. To sum it up, it\r\nis the desire of the Lord God that the loved ones of God and the handmaids\r\nof the Merciful in the West should come closer together in harmony and\r\nunity as day followeth day, and until this is accomplished, the work will\r\nnever go forward. The Spiritual Assemblies are collectively the most\r\neffective of all instruments for establishing unity and harmony. This\r\nmatter is of the utmost importance; this is the magnet that draweth down\r\nthe confirmations of God. If once the beauty of the unity of the\r\nfriends--this Divine Beloved--be decked in the adornments of the Abha\r\nKingdom, it is certain that within a very short time those countries will\r\nbecome the Paradise of the All-Glorious, and that out of the west the\r\nsplendours of unity will cast their bright rays over all the earth.\r\n\r\nWe are striving with heart and soul, resting neither day nor night,\r\nseeking not a moment's ease, to make this world of man the mirror of the\r\nunity of God. Then how much more must the beloved of the Lord reflect that\r\nunity? And this cherished hope, this yearning wish of ours will be visibly\r\nfulfilled only on the day when the true friends of God arise to carry out\r\nthe Teachings of the Abha Beauty--may my life be a ransom for His lovers!\r\nOne amongst His Teachings is this, that love and good faith must so\r\ndominate the human heart that men will regard the stranger as a familiar\r\nfriend, the malefactor as one of their own, the alien even as a loved one,\r\nthe enemy as a companion dear and close. Who killeth them, him will they\r\ncall a bestower of life; who turneth away from them, him will they regard\r\nas turning towards them; who denieth their message, him will they consider\r\nas one acknowledging its truth. The meaning is that they must treat all\r\nhumankind even as they treat their sympathizers, their fellow-believers,\r\ntheir loved ones and familiar friends.\r\n\r\nShould such a torch light up the world community, ye will find that the\r\nwhole earth is sending forth a fragrance, that it hath become a\r\ndelightsome paradise, and the face of it the image of high heaven. Then\r\nwill the whole world be one native land, its diverse peoples one single\r\nkind, the nations of both east and west one household.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that such a day will come, that such a splendour will shine\r\nforth, that such a vision will be unveiled in its full beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42: O YE CO-WORKERS WHO ARE SUPPORTED BY ARMIES ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye co-workers who are supported by armies from the realm of the\r\nAll-Glorious! Blessed are ye, for ye have come together in the sheltering\r\nshade of the Word of God, and have found a refuge in the cave of His\r\nCovenant; ye have brought peace to your hearts by making your home in the\r\nAbha Paradise, and are lulled by the gentle winds that blow from their\r\nsource in His loving-kindness; ye have arisen to serve the Cause of God\r\nand to spread His religion far and wide, to promote His Word and to raise\r\nhigh the banners of holiness throughout all those regions.\r\n\r\nBy the life of Baha! Verily will the consummate power of the Divine\r\nReality breathe into you the bounties of the Holy Spirit, and aid you to\r\nperform an exploit whose like the eye of creation hath never looked upon.\r\n\r\nO ye League of the Covenant! Verily the Abha Beauty made a promise to the\r\nbeloved who are steadfast in the Covenant, that He would reinforce their\r\nstrivings with the strongest of supports, and succour them with His\r\ntriumphant might. Erelong shall ye see that your illumined assemblage hath\r\nleft conspicuous signs and tokens in the hearts and souls of men. Hold ye\r\nfast to the hem of God's garment, and direct all your efforts toward\r\nfurthering His Covenant, and burning ever more brightly with the fire of\r\nHis love, that your hearts may leap for joy in the breathings of servitude\r\nwhich well out from the breast of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Rally your hearts, make\r\nfirm your steps, trust in the everlasting bounties that will be shed upon\r\nyou, one following another from the Kingdom of Abha. Whensoever ye gather\r\nin that radiant assemblage, know ye that the splendours of Baha are\r\nshining over you. It behoveth you to seek agreement and to be united; it\r\nbehoveth you to be in close communion one with the other, at one both in\r\nbody and soul, till ye match the Pleiades or a string of lustrous pearls.\r\nThus will ye be solidly established; thus will your words prevail, your\r\nstar shine out, and your hearts be comforted....\r\n\r\nWhenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this prayer with a heart\r\nthrobbing with the love of God and a tongue purified from all but His\r\nremembrance, that the All-Powerful may graciously aid you to achieve\r\nsupreme victory:\r\n\r\nO God, my God! We are servants of Thine that have turned with devotion to\r\nThy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves from all besides Thee in this\r\nglorious Day. We have gathered in this Spiritual Assembly, united in our\r\nviews and thoughts, with our purposes harmonized to exalt Thy Word amidst\r\nmankind. O Lord, our God! Make us the signs of Thy Divine Guidance, the\r\nStandards of Thine exalted Faith amongst men, servants to Thy mighty\r\nCovenant, O Thou our Lord Most High, manifestations of Thy Divine Unity in\r\nThine Abha Kingdom, and resplendent stars shining upon all regions. Lord!\r\nAid us to become seas surging with the billows of Thy wondrous Grace,\r\nstreams flowing from Thine all-glorious Heights, goodly fruits upon the\r\nTree of Thy heavenly Cause, trees waving through the breezes of Thy Bounty\r\nin Thy celestial Vineyard. O God! Make our souls dependent upon the Verses\r\nof Thy Divine Unity, our hearts cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace,\r\nthat we may unite even as the waves of one sea and become merged together\r\nas the rays of Thine effulgent Light; that our thoughts, our views, our\r\nfeelings may become as one reality, manifesting the spirit of union\r\nthroughout the world. Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Bestower,\r\nthe Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43: THE PRIME REQUISITES FOR THEM THAT TAKE COUNSEL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of\r\nmotive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction\r\nto His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones,\r\npatience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted\r\nThreshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes,\r\nvictory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall be vouchsafed to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44: THE MEMBERS THEREOF MUST TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members thereof(30) must take counsel together in such wise that no\r\noccasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when\r\nevery member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth\r\nforth his argument. Should anyone oppose, he must on no account feel hurt\r\nfor not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed.\r\nThe shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing\r\nopinions. If after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously well and\r\ngood; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a\r\nmajority of voices must prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45: THE FIRST CONDITION IS ABSOLUTE LOVE AND HARMONY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of\r\nthe assembly. They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest\r\nin themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the\r\ndrops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the\r\ntrees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. Should harmony of thought\r\nand absolute unity be nonexistent, that gathering shall be dispersed and\r\nthat assembly be brought to naught. The second condition is that the\r\nmembers of the assembly should unitedly elect a chairman and lay down\r\nguide-lines and by-laws for their meetings and discussions. The chairman\r\nshould have charge of such rules and regulations and protect and enforce\r\nthem; the other members should be submissive, and refrain from conversing\r\non superfluous and extraneous matters. They must, when coming together,\r\nturn their faces to the Kingdom on high and ask aid from the Realm of\r\nGlory. They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity,\r\ncare and moderation to express their views. They must in every matter\r\nsearch out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for\r\nstubbornness and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to\r\ndiscord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. The honoured\r\nmembers must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no\r\nwise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must\r\nwith moderation set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion\r\narise a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to\r\nthe majority. It is again not permitted that any one of the honoured\r\nmembers object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any\r\ndecision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for\r\nsuch criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced. In short,\r\nwhatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with love and purity of\r\nmotive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement\r\nprevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness.... If this be so\r\nregarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it shall lead to\r\ncoolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One.... Should they\r\nendeavour to fulfil these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be\r\nvouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become the centre of the\r\nDivine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their\r\naid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of Spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46: O YE WHO ARE FIRM IN THE COVENANT! 'ABDU'L-BAHA ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye who are firm in the Covenant! 'Abdu'l-Baha is constantly engaged in\r\nideal communication with any Spiritual Assembly which is instituted\r\nthrough the divine bounty, and the members of which, in the utmost\r\ndevotion, turn to the divine Kingdom and are firm in the Covenant. To them\r\nhe is whole-heartedly attached and with them he is linked by everlasting\r\nties. Thus correspondence with that gathering is sincere, constant and\r\nuninterrupted.\r\n\r\nAt every instant, I beg for you assistance, bounty, and a fresh favour and\r\nblessing, so that the confirmations of Baha'u'llah may, like unto the sea,\r\nbe constantly surging, the lights of the Sun of Truth may shine upon you\r\nall and that ye may be confirmed in service, may become the manifestations\r\nof bounty and that each one of you may, at dawn, turn unto the Holy Land\r\nand may experience spiritual emotions with all intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47: O YE TRUE FRIENDS! YOUR LETTER HATH BEEN RECEIVED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye true friends! Your letter hath been received and it brought great\r\njoy. God be praised, ye had made ready an entertainment and established\r\nthe feast which is to be held every nineteen days. Whatsoever gathering is\r\narranged with the utmost love, and where those who attend are turning\r\ntheir faces toward the Kingdom of God, and where the discourse is of the\r\nTeachings of God, and the effect of which is to cause those present to\r\nadvance--that gathering is the Lord's, and that festive table hath come\r\ndown from heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that this feast will be given on one day out of every\r\nnineteen, for it bringeth you closer together; it is the very well-spring\r\nof unity and loving-kindness.\r\n\r\nYe observe to what a degree the world is in continual turmoil and\r\nconflict, and to what a pass its nations have now come. Perchance will the\r\nlovers of God succeed in upraising the banner of human unity, so that the\r\none-coloured tabernacle of the Kingdom of Heaven will cast its sheltering\r\nshadow over all the earth; that misunderstandings among the world's\r\npeoples will vanish away; that all nations will mingle one with another,\r\ndealing with one another even as the lover with his beloved.\r\n\r\nIt is your duty to be exceedingly kind to every human being, and to wish\r\nhim well; to work for the upliftment of society; to blow the breath of\r\nlife into the dead; to act in accordance with the instructions of\r\nBaha'u'llah and walk His path--until ye change the world of man into the\r\nworld of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48: O YE LOYAL SERVANTS OF THE ANCIENT BEAUTY! IN EVERY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye loyal servants of the Ancient Beauty! In every cycle and\r\ndispensation, the feast hath been favoured and loved, and the spreading of\r\na table for the lovers of God hath been considered a praiseworthy act.\r\nThis is especially the case today, in this dispensation beyond compare,\r\nthis most generous of ages, when it is highly acclaimed, for it is truly\r\naccounted among such gatherings as are held to worship and glorify God.\r\nHere the holy verses, the heavenly odes and laudations are intoned, and\r\nthe heart is quickened, and carried away from itself.\r\n\r\nThe primary intent is to kindle these stirrings of the spirit, but at the\r\nsame time it follows quite naturally that those present should partake of\r\nfood, so that the world of the body may mirror the spirit's world, and\r\nflesh take on the qualities of soul; and just as the spiritual delights\r\nare here in profusion, so too the material delights.\r\n\r\nHappy are ye, to be observing this rule, with all its mystic meanings,\r\nthus keeping the friends of God alert and heedful, and bringing them peace\r\nof mind, and joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49: THY LETTER HATH BEEN RECEIVED. THOU DIDST WRITE OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThy letter hath been received. Thou didst write of the Nineteen Day\r\nfestivity, and this rejoiced my heart. These gatherings cause the divine\r\ntable to descend from heaven, and draw down the confirmations of the\r\nAll-Merciful. My hope is that the breathings of the Holy Spirit will be\r\nwafted over them, and that each one present shall, in great assemblies,\r\nwith an eloquent tongue and a heart flooded with the love of God, set\r\nhimself to acclaiming the rise of the Sun of Truth, the dawn of the\r\nDay-Star that lighteth all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50: YOU HAVE ASKED AS TO THE FEAST IN EVERY BAHA'I ...\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have asked as to the feast in every Baha'i month. This feast is held\r\nto foster comradeship and love, to call God to mind and supplicate Him\r\nwith contrite hearts, and to encourage benevolent pursuits.\r\n\r\nThat is, the friends should there dwell upon God and glorify Him, read the\r\nprayers and holy verses, and treat one another with the utmost affection\r\nand love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51: AS TO THE NINETEEN DAY FEAST, IT REJOICETH MIND AND ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the Nineteen Day Feast, it rejoiceth mind and heart. If this feast\r\nbe held in the proper fashion, the friends will, once in nineteen days,\r\nfind themselves spiritually restored, and endued with a power that is not\r\nof this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52: O SERVANT OF THE ONE TRUE GOD! THE LORD BE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO servant of the One true God! The Lord be praised, the loved ones of God\r\nare found in every land, and are, one and all, neath the shadow of the\r\nTree of Life and under the protection of His good providence. His care and\r\nloving-kindness surge even as the eternal billows of the sea, and His\r\nblessings are continually showered from His eternal Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOurs should be the prayer that His blessings may be vouchsafed in still\r\ngreater abundance, and ours to hold fast to such means as shall ensure a\r\nfuller outpouring of His grace and a greater measure of His divine\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of these means is the spirit of true fellowship and\r\nloving communion amongst the friends. Remember the saying: 'Of all\r\npilgrimages the greatest is to relieve the sorrow-laden heart.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53: VERILY, 'ABDU'L-BAHA INHALETH THE FRAGRANCE OF THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerily, 'Abdu'l-Baha inhaleth the fragrance of the love of God from every\r\nmeeting place where the Word of God is uttered and proofs and arguments\r\nset forth that shed their rays across the world, and where they recount\r\nthe tribulations of 'Abdu'l-Baha at the evil hands of those who have\r\nviolated the Covenant of God.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of the Lord! Speak thou no word of politics; thy task\r\nconcerneth the life of the soul, for this verily leadeth to man's joy in\r\nthe world of God. Except to speak well of them, make thou no mention of\r\nthe earth's kings, and the worldly governments thereof. Rather, confine\r\nthine utterance to spreading the blissful tidings of the Kingdom of God,\r\nand demonstrating the influence of the Word of God, and the holiness of\r\nthe Cause of God. Tell thou of abiding joy and spiritual delights, and\r\ngodlike qualities, and of how the Sun of Truth hath risen above the\r\nearth's horizons: tell of the blowing of the spirit of life into the body\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54: YE HAVE WRITTEN AS TO THE MEETINGS OF THE FRIENDS, AND ...\r\n\r\n\r\nYe have written as to the meetings of the friends, and how filled they are\r\nwith peace and joy. Of course this is so; for wherever the spiritually\r\nminded are gathered together, there in His beauty reigneth Baha'u'llah.\r\nThus it is certain that such reunions will yield boundless happiness and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nToday it behoveth one and all to forgo the mention of all else, and to\r\ndisregard all things. Let their speaking, let their inner state be summed\r\nup thus: 'Keep all my words of prayer and praise confined to one refrain;\r\nmake all my life but servitude to Thee.' That is, let them concentrate all\r\ntheir thoughts, all their words, on teaching the Cause of God and\r\nspreading the Faith of God, and inspiring all to characterize themselves\r\nwith the characteristics of God; on loving mankind; on being pure and holy\r\nin all things, and spotless in their public and private life; on being\r\nupright and detached, and fervent, and afire. All is to be yielded up,\r\nsave only the remembrance of God; all is to be dispraised, except His\r\npraise. Today, to this melody of the Company on high, the world will leap\r\nand dance: 'Glory be to my Lord, the All-Glorious!' But know ye this: save\r\nfor this song of God, no song will stir the world, and save for this\r\nnightingale-cry of truth from the Garden of God, no melody will lure away\r\nthe heart. 'Whence cometh this Singer Who speaketh the Beloved's name?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55: IT BEFITTETH THE FRIENDS TO HOLD A GATHERING, A ...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt befitteth the friends to hold a gathering, a meeting, where they shall\r\nglorify God and fix their hearts upon Him, and read and recite the Holy\r\nWritings of the Blessed Beauty--may my soul be the ransom of His lovers!\r\nThe lights of the All-Glorious Realm, the rays of the Supreme Horizon,\r\nwill be cast upon such bright assemblages, for these are none other than\r\nthe Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kars, the Dawning-Points of God's Remembrance, which\r\nmust, at the direction of the Most Exalted Pen, be established in every\r\nhamlet and city... These spiritual gatherings must be held with the utmost\r\npurity and consecration, so that from the site itself, and its earth and\r\nthe air about it, one will inhale the fragrant breathings of the Holy\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56: WHENSOEVER A COMPANY OF PEOPLE SHALL GATHER IN A ...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhensoever a company of people shall gather in a meeting place, shall\r\nengage in glorifying God, and shall speak with one another of the\r\nmysteries of God, beyond any doubt the breathings of the Holy Spirit will\r\nblow gently over them, and each shall receive a share thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57: WE HEAR THAT THOU HAST IN MIND TO EMBELLISH THY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hear that thou hast in mind to embellish thy house from time to time\r\nwith a meeting of Baha'is, where some among them will engage in glorifying\r\nthe All-Glorious Lord... Know that shouldst thou bring this about, that\r\nhouse of earth will become a house of heaven, and that fabric of stone a\r\ncongress of the spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58: THOU HAST ASKED ABOUT PLACES OF WORSHIP AND THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThou hast asked about places of worship and the underlying reason\r\ntherefor. The wisdom in raising up such buildings is that at a given hour,\r\nthe people should know it is time to meet, and all should gather together,\r\nand, harmoniously attuned one to another, engage in prayer; with the\r\nresult that out of this coming together, unity and affection shall grow\r\nand flourish in the human heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59: 'ABDU'L-BAHA HATH LONG CHERISHED THE DESIRE THAT A ...\r\n\r\n\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha hath long cherished the desire that a Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar\r\nbe upraised in that region. Praised be God, thanks to the strenuous\r\nefforts of the friends, in recent days the joyful news of this hath been\r\nannounced. This service is highly acceptable at the Threshold of God, for\r\nthe Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar inspiriteth the lovers of God and delighteth\r\ntheir hearts, and causeth them to become steadfast and firm.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of the utmost significance. If the erection of the House\r\nof Worship in a public place would arouse the hostility of evil-doers,\r\nthen the meeting must, in every locality, be held in some hidden place.\r\nEven in every hamlet, a place must be set aside as the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, and even though it be underground.\r\n\r\nNow, praised be God, ye have succeeded in this. Engage ye in the\r\nremembrance of God at dawn; rise ye up to praise and glorify Him. Blessed\r\nare ye, and joy be yours, O ye the righteous, for having established the\r\nDawning-Point of the Praises of God. Verily I ask of the Lord that He make\r\nyou standards of salvation and banners of redemption, rippling high over\r\nthe valleys and hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60: ALTHOUGH TO OUTWARD SEEMING THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough to outward seeming the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is a material\r\nstructure, yet it hath a spiritual effect. It forgeth bonds of unity from\r\nheart to heart; it is a collective centre for men's souls. Every city in\r\nwhich, during the days of the Manifestation, a temple was raised up, hath\r\ncreated security and constancy and peace, for such buildings were given\r\nover to the perpetual glorification of God, and only in the remembrance of\r\nGod can the heart find rest. Gracious God! The edifice of the House of\r\nWorship hath a powerful influence on every phase of life. Experience hath,\r\nin the east, clearly shown this to be a fact. Even if, in some small\r\nvillage, a house was designated as the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, it produced\r\na marked effect; how much greater would be the impact of one especially\r\nraised up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61: O LORD, O THOU WHO DOST BLESS ALL THOSE WHO ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO Lord, O Thou Who dost bless all those who stand firm in the Covenant by\r\nenabling them, out of their love for the Light of the World, to expend\r\nwhat they have as an offering to the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the dayspring\r\nof Thy wide-spread rays and the proclaimer of Thine evidences, help Thou,\r\nboth in this world and the world to come, these righteous these upright\r\nand pious ones to draw ever nearer to Thy sacred Threshold, and make\r\nbright their faces with Thy dazzling splendours.\r\n\r\nVerily art Thou the Generous, the Ever-Bestowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62: O MY WELL-BELOVED DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO my well-beloved daughter of the Kingdom! The letter thou hadst written\r\nto Dr. Esslemont was forwarded by him to the Land of Desire [The Holy\r\nLand]. I read it all through with the greatest attention. On the one hand,\r\nI was deeply touched, for thou hadst sheared off those fair tresses of\r\nthine with the shears of detachment from this world and of self-sacrifice\r\nin the path of the Kingdom of God. And on the other, I was greatly\r\npleased, for that dearly-beloved daughter hath evinced so great a spirit\r\nof self-sacrifice as to offer up so precious a part of her body in the\r\npathway of the Cause of God. Hadst thou sought my opinion, I would in no\r\nwise have consented that thou shouldst shear off even a single thread of\r\nthy comely and wavy locks; nay, I myself would have contributed in thy\r\nname for the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar. This deed of thine is, however, an\r\neloquent testimony to thy noble spirit of self-sacrifice. Thou hast,\r\nverily, sacrificed thy life and great will be the spiritual results thou\r\nshalt obtain. Rest thou confident that day by day thou shalt progress and\r\nwax greater in firmness and in constancy. The bounties of Baha'u'llah\r\nshall compass thee about and the joyful tidings from on high shall time\r\nand again be imparted unto thee. And though it be thine hair that thou\r\nhast sacrificed, yet thou shalt be filled with the Spirit, and though it\r\nbe this perishable member of thy body which thou hast laid down in the\r\npath of God, yet thou shalt find the Divine Gift, shalt behold the\r\nCelestial Beauty, obtain imperishable glory and attain unto everlasting\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63: O YE BLESSED SOULS! THE LETTER YE HAD WRITTEN TO ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye blessed souls!(31) The letter ye had written to Rahmatu'llah hath\r\nbeen perused. Many and various were the joyful tidings it conveyed,\r\nnamely, that through the power of faith and constancy in the Covenant,\r\nnumerous gatherings have been convened, and the loved ones are everywhere\r\nastir and active.\r\n\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha's ardent desire hath ever been that the soil of that hallowed\r\nspot, which in the earliest days of the Cause hath been refreshed and made\r\nverdant with the spring showers of grace, may so bloom and blossom as to\r\nfill every heart with joy.\r\n\r\nPraised be the Lord, the Cause of God hath been proclaimed and promoted\r\nthroughout the East and the West in such wise that no mind had ever\r\nconceived that the sweet savours of the Lord would so rapidly perfume all\r\nregions. This, verily, is only through the consummate bounties of the\r\never-blessed Beauty, Whose grace and Whose triumphing power are time and\r\nagain abundantly received.\r\n\r\nOne of the wondrous events that has of late come to pass is this, that the\r\nedifice of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is being raised in the very heart of\r\nthe American continent, and numerous souls from the surrounding regions\r\nare contributing for the erection of this holy Temple. Among these is a\r\nhighly esteemed lady of the city of Manchester, who hath been moved to\r\noffer her share.\r\n\r\nHaving no portion of goods and earthly riches, she sheared off with her\r\nown hands the fine, long and precious tresses that adorned her head so\r\ngracefully, and offered them for sale, that the price thereof might\r\npromote the cause of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar.\r\n\r\nConsider ye, that though in the eyes of women nothing is more precious\r\nthan rich and flowing locks, yet notwithstanding this, that\r\nhighly-honoured lady hath evinced so rare and beautiful a spirit of\r\nself-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnd though this was uncalled for, and 'Abdu'l-Baha would not have\r\nconsented to such a deed, yet as it doth reveal so high and noble a spirit\r\nof devotion, He was deeply touched thereby. Precious though the hair be in\r\nthe sight of western women, nay, more precious than life itself, yet she\r\noffered it up as a sacrifice for the cause of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar!\r\n\r\nIt is related that once in the days of the Apostle of God(32) He signified\r\nHis desire that an army should advance in a certain direction, and leave\r\nwas granted unto the faithful to raise contributions for the holy war.\r\nAmong many was one man who gave a thousand camels, each laden with corn,\r\nanother who gave half his substance, and still another who offered all\r\nthat he had. But a woman stricken in years, whose sole possession was a\r\nhandful of dates, came to the Apostle and laid at His feet her humble\r\ncontribution. Thereupon the Prophet of God--may my life be offered up as a\r\nsacrifice unto Him--bade that this handful of dates be placed over and\r\nabove all the contributions that had been gathered, thus asserting the\r\nmerit and superiority thereof over all the rest. This was done because\r\nthat elderly woman had no other earthly possessions but these.\r\n\r\nAnd in like manner this esteemed lady had nothing else to contribute but\r\nher precious locks, and these she gloriously sacrificed in the cause of\r\nthe Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar.\r\n\r\nPonder and reflect how mighty and potent hath the Cause of God become! A\r\nwoman of the west hath given her hair for the glory of the\r\nMa_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar.\r\n\r\nNay, this is but a lesson unto them that perceive.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I am greatly pleased with the loved ones in Najaf-Abad for,\r\nfrom the very early dawn of the Cause unto this day they have one and all\r\nunder all conditions evinced a great spirit of self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nZaynu'l-Muqarrabin hath throughout his lifetime prayed with all the\r\nsincerity of his stainless soul on behalf of the believers in Najaf-Abad\r\nand implored for them the grace of God and His divine confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe Lord be praised that the prayers of this gracious soul have been\r\nanswered, for the effects thereof are everywhere manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64: THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR IS ONE OF THE MOST VITAL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is one of the most vital institutions in the\r\nworld, and it hath many subsidiary branches. Although it is a House of\r\nWorship, it is also connected with a hospital, a drug dispensary, a\r\ntraveller's hospice, a school for orphans, and a university for advanced\r\nstudies. Every Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is connected with these five things.\r\nMy hope is that the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar will now be established in\r\nAmerica, and that gradually the hospital, the school, the university, the\r\ndispensary and the hospice, all functioning according to the most\r\nefficient and orderly procedures, will follow. Make these matters known to\r\nthe beloved of the Lord, so that they will understand how very great is\r\nthe importance of this 'Dawning-Point of the Remembrance of God.' The\r\nTemple is not only a place for worship; rather, in every respect is it\r\ncomplete and whole.\r\n\r\nO thou dear handmaid of God! If only thou couldst know what a high station\r\nis destined for those souls who are severed from the world, are powerfully\r\nattracted to the Faith, and are teaching, under the sheltering shadow of\r\nBaha'u'llah! How thou wouldst rejoice, how thou wouldst, in exultation and\r\nrapture, spread thy wings and soar heavenward--for being a follower of such\r\na way, and a traveller toward such a Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs to the terminology I used in my letter, bidding thee to consecrate\r\nthyself to service in the Cause of God, the meaning of it is this: limit\r\nthy thoughts to teaching the Faith. Act by day and night according to the\r\nteachings and counsels and admonitions of Baha'u'llah. This doth not\r\npreclude marriage. Thou canst take unto thyself a husband and at the same\r\ntime serve the Cause of God; the one doth not preclude the other. Know\r\nthou the value of these days; let not this chance escape thee. Beg thou\r\nGod to make thee a lighted candle, so that thou mayest guide a great\r\nmultitude through this darksome world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65: O THOU FAVOURED HANDMAID OF THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou favoured handmaid of the heavenly Kingdom! Thy letter hath been\r\nreceived. It conveyeth high aspirations and noble goals, saying that thou\r\nhast in mind to make a journey to the Far East, and that thou art ready to\r\nendure extreme hardships, in order to guide the souls, and to spread far\r\nand wide the glad tidings of God's Kingdom. This purpose of thine\r\nbetokeneth that thou, dear handmaid of God, dost cherish the very noblest\r\nof all aims.\r\n\r\nWhen delivering the glad tidings, speak out and say: the Promised One of\r\nall the world's peoples hath now been made manifest. For each and every\r\npeople, and every religion, await a Promised One, and Baha'u'llah is that\r\nOne Who is awaited by all; and therefore the Cause of Baha'u'llah will\r\nbring about the oneness of mankind, and the tabernacle of unity will be\r\nupraised on the heights of the world, and the banners of the universality\r\nof all humankind will be unfurled on the peaks of the earth. When thou\r\ndost loose thy tongue to deliver this great good news, this will become\r\nthe means of teaching the people.\r\n\r\nThy projected journey, however, is to a very far-away land, and unless a\r\ngroup of persons be available, the glad tidings will not take much effect\r\nin that place. If ye think best, travel instead to Persia, and on the way\r\nback, go through Japan and China. This would appear to be much better, and\r\nfar more enjoyable. In any case, do whatever seemeth feasible, and it will\r\nbe approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66: O THOU WHO HAST SOUGHT ILLUMINATION FROM THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who hast sought illumination from the light of guidance! Praise\r\nthou God that He hath directed thee to the light of truth and hath invited\r\nthee to enter the Kingdom of Abha. Thy sight hath been illumined and thy\r\nheart hath been turned into a rose garden. I pray for thee that thou\r\nmayest ever grow in faith and assurance, shine like unto a torch in the\r\nassemblies and bestow upon them the light of guidance.\r\n\r\nWhenever an illumined assembly of the friends of God is gathered,\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha, although bodily absent, is yet present in spirit and in\r\nsoul. I am always a traveller to America and am assuredly associating with\r\nspiritual and illumined friends. Distance is annihilated and prevents not\r\nthe close and intimate association of two souls that are closely attached\r\nin heart even though they may be in two different countries. I am\r\ntherefore thy close companion, attuned and in harmony with thy soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67: O THOU LADY OF THE KINGDOM! THY LETTER SENT FROM ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou lady of the Kingdom! Thy letter sent from New York hath been\r\nreceived. Its contents imparted joy and gladness for they indicated that\r\nwith a firm resolve and a pure intention thou hast determined to travel to\r\nParis, that thou mayest in that silent city enkindle the fire of the love\r\nof God and in the midst of that darkness of nature shine like unto a\r\nresplendent candle. This journey is highly praiseworthy and suitable. When\r\nthou reachest Paris, thou must strive, no matter how small the number of\r\nthe friends may be, to institute the assembly of the Covenant and to\r\nvivify the souls through the power of the Covenant.\r\n\r\nParis is exceedingly dispirited and is in a state of torpor and so far it\r\nhath not burst into flames although the French nation is an active and\r\nlively one. But the world of nature hath fully stretched its pavilion over\r\nParis and hath done away with religious sentiments. But this power of the\r\nCovenant shall heat every freezing soul, shall bestow light upon\r\neverything that is dark and shall secure for the captive in the hand of\r\nnature the true freedom of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nArise thou at present in Paris with the power of the Kingdom, with a\r\ndivine confirmation, with a genuine zeal and ardour and with a flame of\r\nthe love of God. Roar like unto a lion and exhibit such ecstasy and love\r\namong these few souls that praise and glorification may continuously reach\r\nthee from the divine Kingdom and mighty confirmations may descend upon\r\nthee. Rest thou assured. If thou dost act accordingly and hoist the\r\nstandard of the Covenant, Paris shall burst into flame. Be constantly\r\nattached to and seek always the confirmations of Baha'u'llah for these\r\nturn the drop into a sea and convert the gnat into an eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n68: O YE WHO ARE FIRM IN THE COVENANT AND THE TESTAMENT! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye who are firm in the Covenant and the Testament! Your letter was\r\nreceived and your blessed names were one by one perused. The contents of\r\nthe letter were divine inspirations and manifest bounties because they\r\nwere indicative of the union of the friends and the harmony of all hearts.\r\n\r\nToday the most remarkable favour of God centereth around union and harmony\r\namong the friends; so that this unity and concord may be the cause of the\r\npromulgation of the oneness of the world of humanity, may emancipate the\r\nworld from this intense darkness of enmity and rancour, and that the Sun\r\nof Truth may shine in full and perfect effulgence.\r\n\r\nToday, all the peoples of the world are indulging in self-interest and\r\nexert the utmost effort and endeavour to promote their own material\r\ninterests. They are worshipping themselves and not the divine reality, nor\r\nthe world of mankind. They seek diligently their own benefit and not the\r\ncommon weal. This is because they are captives of the world of nature and\r\nunaware of the divine teachings, of the bounty of the Kingdom and of the\r\nSun of Truth. But ye, praise be to God, are at present especially favoured\r\nwith this bounty, have become of the chosen, have been informed of the\r\nheavenly instructions, have gained admittance into the Kingdom of God,\r\nhave become the recipients of unbounded blessings and have been baptized\r\nwith the Water of Life, with the fire of the love of God and with the Holy\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\nStrive, therefore, with heart and soul that ye become ignited candles in\r\nthe assemblage of the world, glittering stars on the horizon of Truth and\r\nmay become the cause of the propagation of the light of the Kingdom; in\r\norder that the world of humanity may be converted into a divine realm, the\r\nnether world may become the world on high, the love of God and the mercy\r\nof the Lord may raise their canopy upon the apex of the world, human souls\r\nmay become the waves of the ocean of truth, the world of humanity may grow\r\ninto one blessed tree, the verses of oneness may be chanted and the\r\nmelodies of sanctity may reach the Supreme Concourse.\r\n\r\nDay and night I entreat and supplicate to the Kingdom of God and beg for\r\nyou infinite assistance and confirmation. Do not take into consideration\r\nyour own aptitudes and capacities, but fix your gaze on the consummate\r\nbounty, the divine bestowal and the power of the Holy Spirit--the power\r\nthat converteth the drop into a sea and the star into a sun.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, the hosts of the Supreme Concourse secure the victory\r\nand the power of the Kingdom is ready to assist and to support. Should ye\r\nat every instant unloosen the tongue in thanksgiving and gratitude, ye\r\nwould not be able to discharge yourselves of the obligation of gratitude\r\nfor these bestowals.\r\n\r\nConsider: eminent personages whose fame hath spread all over the world\r\nshall, erelong, fade into utter nothingness as the result of their\r\ndeprivation of this heavenly bounty; no name and no fame shall they leave\r\nbehind, and of them no fruit and trace shall survive. But as the\r\neffulgences of the Sun of Truth have dawned forth upon you and ye have\r\nattained everlasting life, ye shall shine and sparkle forevermore from the\r\nhorizon of existence.\r\n\r\nPeter was a fisherman and Mary Magdalene a peasant, but as they were\r\nspecially favoured with the blessings of Christ, the horizon of their\r\nfaith became illumined, and down to the present day they are shining from\r\nthe horizon of everlasting glory. In this station, merit and capacity are\r\nnot to be considered; nay rather, the resplendent rays of the Sun of\r\nTruth, which have illumined these mirrors, must be taken into account.\r\n\r\nYe are inviting me to America. I am likewise longing to gaze upon those\r\nillumined faces and converse and associate with those true friends. But\r\nthe magnetic power which shall draw me to those shores is the union and\r\nharmony of the friends, their behaviour and conduct in accordance with the\r\nteachings of God and the firmness of all in the Covenant and the\r\nTestament.\r\n\r\nO Divine Providence! This assemblage is composed of Thy friends who are\r\nattracted to Thy beauty and are set ablaze by the fire of Thy love. Turn\r\nthese souls into heavenly angels, resuscitate them through the breath of\r\nThy Holy Spirit, grant them eloquent tongues and resolute hearts, bestow\r\nupon them heavenly power and merciful susceptibilities, cause them to\r\nbecome the promulgators of the oneness of mankind and the cause of love\r\nand concord in the world of humanity, so that the perilous darkness of\r\nignorant prejudice may vanish through the light of the Sun of Truth, this\r\ndreary world may become illumined, this material realm may absorb the rays\r\nof the world of spirit, these different colours may merge into one colour\r\nand the melody of praise may rise to the kingdom of Thy sanctity.\r\n\r\nVerily, Thou art the Omnipotent and the Almighty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69: THOU HAST WRITTEN CONCERNING ORGANIZATION. THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThou hast written concerning organization. The divine teachings and the\r\nadmonitions and exhortations of Baha'u'llah are manifestly evident. These\r\nconstitute the organization of the Kingdom and their enforcement is\r\nobligatory. The least deviation from them is absolute error.\r\n\r\nThou hast written concerning my travel to America. If thou couldst see how\r\nthe waves of constant occupation are surging thou wouldst have considered\r\nthat time for travel is absolutely lacking; in times of fixed residence\r\npartial rest is even impossible. God willing, I trust, through the bounty\r\nof Baha'u'llah, that as soon as means for the composure of mind and of\r\nheart are provided, I shall determine to journey and shall inform thee\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70: O THOU IGNITED CANDLE! THY LETTER WAS RECEIVED. ITS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou ignited candle! Thy letter was received. Its contents imparted\r\nspiritual gladness, for they were pervaded by spiritual sentiments and\r\nindicated the attraction of thy heart, attachment to the Kingdom of God\r\nand love for His divine teachings.\r\n\r\nVerily, thou showest a high endeavour, hast a pure and sanctified purpose,\r\nwishest naught save the good-pleasure of God, seekest nothing but the\r\nattainment of limitless bounties, and art engaged in the promulgation of\r\ndivine teachings and the explanation of abstruse metaphysical problems. It\r\nis my hope that, by the favour of Baha'u'llah, thou and thy respected wife\r\nmay daily increase in firmness and steadfastness, so that in that exalted\r\nland ye may become two upraised standards and two resplendent lights.\r\n\r\nExtensive travel in October, to the north, south, east and west,\r\naccompanied by that candle of the love of God, Mrs. Maxwell, would be\r\nhighly acceptable. My hope is that she may entirely recover; this beloved\r\nhandmaid of God is like a flame of fire and thinks day and night of\r\nnothing save service to God. For the present, travel throughout the\r\nnorthern states, and in the winter season hasten to the states in the\r\nsouth. Your service should consist of eloquent speeches delivered in\r\ngatherings wherein ye may promulgate the divine teachings. If possible,\r\nundertake at some time a voyage to the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nThe events which have transpired were all recorded fifty years ago in the\r\nTablets of Baha'u'llah--Tablets which have been printed, published and\r\nspread throughout the world. The teachings of Baha'u'llah are the light of\r\nthis age and the spirit of this century. Expound each of them at every\r\ngathering.\r\n\r\nThe first is investigation of truth,\r\nThe second, the oneness of mankind,\r\nThe third, universal peace,\r\nThe fourth, conformity between science and divine revelation,\r\nThe fifth, abandonment of racial, religious, worldly and political\r\nprejudices, prejudices which destroy the foundation of mankind.\r\nThe sixth is righteousness and justice,\r\nThe seventh, the betterment of morals and heavenly education,\r\nThe eighth, the equality of the two sexes,\r\nThe ninth, the diffusion of knowledge and education,\r\nThe tenth, economic questions,\r\n\r\nand so on and so forth. Strive that souls may attain unto the light of\r\nguidance and hold fast unto the hem of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nThe letter thou hast enclosed was perused. When man's soul is rarified and\r\ncleansed, spiritual links are established, and from these bonds sensations\r\nfelt by the heart are produced. The human heart resembleth a mirror. When\r\nthis is purified human hearts are attuned and reflect one another, and\r\nthus spiritual emotions are generated. This is like the world of dreams\r\nwhen man is detached from things which are tangible and experienceth those\r\nof the spirit. What amazing laws operate, and what remarkable discoveries\r\nare made! And it may even be that detailed communications are\r\nregistered...\r\n\r\nFinally, I hope that in Chicago the friends may become united and may\r\nillumine that city, for therein the dawn of the Cause appeared, and in\r\nthis lieth its preference over other cities. Therefore it must be held in\r\nrespect; perchance it may, God willing, be freed from all spiritual\r\nafflictions, and may attain unto perfect health and become a centre of the\r\nCovenant and Testament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n71: O THOU BELOVED MAIDSERVANT OF GOD! THY LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou beloved maidservant of God! Thy letter was received and its\r\ncontents revealed the fact that the friends, in perfect energy and\r\nvitality are engaged in the propagation of the heavenly teachings. This\r\nnews hath caused intense joy and gladness. For every era hath a spirit;\r\nthe spirit of this illumined era lieth in the teachings of Baha'u'llah.\r\nFor these lay the foundation of the oneness of the world of humanity and\r\npromulgate universal brotherhood. They are founded upon the unity of\r\nscience and religion and upon investigation of truth. They uphold the\r\nprinciple that religion must be the cause of amity, union and harmony\r\namong men. They establish the equality of both sexes and propound economic\r\nprinciples which are for the happiness of individuals. They diffuse\r\nuniversal education, that every soul may as much as possible have a share\r\nof knowledge. They abrogate and nullify religious, racial, political,\r\npatriotic and economic prejudices and the like. Those teachings that are\r\nscattered throughout the Epistles and Tablets are the cause of the\r\nillumination and the life of the world of humanity. Whoever promulgateth\r\nthem will verily be assisted by the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Republic, Dr. Wilson, is indeed serving the Kingdom\r\nof God for he is restless and strives day and night that the rights of all\r\nmen may be preserved safe and secure, that even small nations, like\r\ngreater ones, may dwell in peace and comfort, under the protection of\r\nRighteousness and Justice. This purpose is indeed a lofty one. I trust\r\nthat the incomparable Providence will assist and confirm such souls under\r\nall conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72: O THOU TRUE FRIEND! READ, IN THE SCHOOL OF GOD, THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou true friend! Read, in the school of God, the lessons of the spirit,\r\nand learn from love's Teacher the innermost truths. Seek out the secrets\r\nof Heaven, and tell of the overflowing grace and favour of God.\r\n\r\nAlthough to acquire the sciences and arts is the greatest glory of\r\nmankind, this is so only on condition that man's river flow into the\r\nmighty sea, and draw from God's ancient source His inspiration. When this\r\ncometh to pass, then every teacher is as a shoreless ocean, every pupil a\r\nprodigal fountain of knowledge. If, then, the pursuit of knowledge lead to\r\nthe beauty of Him Who is the Object of all Knowledge, how excellent that\r\ngoal; but if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man off from flooding\r\ngrace, for with learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth on\r\nerror and indifference to God.\r\n\r\nThe sciences of today are bridges to reality; if then they lead not to\r\nreality, naught remains but fruitless illusion. By the one true God! If\r\nlearning be not a means of access to Him, the Most Manifest, it is nothing\r\nbut evident loss.\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent upon thee to acquire the various branches of knowledge,\r\nand to turn thy face toward the beauty of the Manifest Beauty, that thou\r\nmayest be a sign of saving guidance amongst the peoples of the world, and\r\na focal centre of understanding in this sphere from which the wise and\r\ntheir wisdom are shut out, except for those who set foot in the Kingdom of\r\nlights and become informed of the veiled and hidden mystery, the\r\nwell-guarded secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73: O DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM! THY LETTER HATH COME ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO daughter of the Kingdom! Thy letter hath come and its contents make\r\nclear the fact that thou hast directed all thy thoughts toward acquiring\r\nlight from the realms of mystery. So long as the thoughts of an individual\r\nare scattered he will achieve no results, but if his thinking be\r\nconcentrated on a single point wonderful will be the fruits thereof.\r\n\r\nOne cannot obtain the full force of the sunlight when it is cast on a flat\r\nmirror, but once the sun shineth upon a concave mirror, or on a lens that\r\nis convex, all its heat will be concentrated on a single point, and that\r\none point will burn the hottest. Thus is it necessary to focus one's\r\nthinking on a single point so that it will become an effective force.\r\n\r\nThou didst wish to celebrate the Day of Ridvan with a feast, and to have\r\nthose present on that day engage in reciting Tablets with delight and joy,\r\nand thou didst request me to send thee a letter to be read on that day. My\r\nletter is this:\r\n\r\nO ye beloved, and ye handmaids of the Merciful! This is the day when the\r\nDay-Star of Truth rose over the horizon of life, and its glory spread, and\r\nits brightness shone out with such power that it clove the dense and\r\nhigh-piled clouds and mounted the skies of the world in all its splendour.\r\nHence do ye witness a new stirring throughout all created things.\r\n\r\nSee how, in this day, the scope of sciences and arts hath widened out, and\r\nwhat wondrous technical advances have been made, and to what a high degree\r\nthe mind's powers have increased, and what stupendous inventions have\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nThis age is indeed as a hundred other ages: should ye gather the yield of\r\na hundred ages, and set that against the accumulated product of our times,\r\nthe yield of this one era will prove greater than that of a hundred gone\r\nbefore. Take ye, for an example, the sum total of all the books that were\r\never written in ages past, and compare that with the books and treatises\r\nthat our era hath produced: these books, written in our day alone, far and\r\naway exceed the total number of volumes that have been written down the\r\nages. See how powerful is the influence exerted by the Day-Star of the\r\nworld upon the inner essence of all created things!\r\n\r\nBut alas, a thousand times alas! The eyes see it not, the ears are deaf,\r\nand the hearts and minds are oblivious of this supreme bestowal. Strive ye\r\nthen, with all your hearts and souls, to awaken those who slumber, to\r\ncause the blind to see, and the dead to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74: O BIRD THAT SINGETH SWEETLY OF THE ABHA BEAUTY! IN ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO bird that singeth sweetly of the Abha Beauty! In this new and wondrous\r\ndispensation the veils of superstition have been torn asunder and the\r\nprejudices of eastern peoples stand condemned. Among certain nations of\r\nthe East, music was considered reprehensible, but in this new age the\r\nManifest Light hath, in His holy Tablets, specifically proclaimed that\r\nmusic, sung or played, is spiritual food for soul and heart.\r\n\r\nThe musician's art is among those arts worthy of the highest praise, and\r\nit moveth the hearts of all who grieve. Wherefore, O thou _Sh_ahnaz,(33)\r\nplay and sing out the holy words of God with wondrous tones in the\r\ngatherings of the friends, that the listener may be freed from chains of\r\ncare and sorrow, and his soul may leap for joy and humble itself in prayer\r\nto the realm of Glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75: STRIVE WITH HEART AND SOUL IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT ...\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive with heart and soul in order to bring about union and harmony among\r\nthe white and the black and prove thereby the unity of the Baha'i world\r\nwherein distinction of colour findeth no place, but where hearts only are\r\nconsidered. Praise be to God, the hearts of the friends are united and\r\nlinked together, whether they be from the east or the west, from north or\r\nfrom south, whether they be German, French, Japanese, American, and\r\nwhether they pertain to the white, the black, the red, the yellow or the\r\nbrown race. Variations of colour, of land and of race are of no importance\r\nin the Baha'i Faith; on the contrary, Baha'i unity overcometh them all and\r\ndoeth away with all these fancies and imaginations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76: O THOU WHO HAST AN ILLUMINED HEART! THOU ART EVEN ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who hast an illumined heart! Thou art even as the pupil of the eye,\r\nthe very wellspring of the light, for God's love hath cast its rays upon\r\nthine inmost being and thou hast turned thy face toward the Kingdom of thy\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nIntense is the hatred, in America, between black and white, but my hope is\r\nthat the power of the Kingdom will bind these two in friendship, and serve\r\nthem as a healing balm.\r\n\r\nLet them look not upon a man's colour but upon his heart. If the heart be\r\nfilled with light, that man is nigh unto the threshold of his Lord; but if\r\nnot, that man is careless of his Lord, be he white or be he black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77: O THOU REVERED MAIDSERVANT OF GOD! THY LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou revered maidservant of God! Thy letter from Los Angeles was\r\nreceived. Thank divine Providence that thou hast been assisted in service\r\nand hast been the cause of the promulgation of the oneness of the world of\r\nhumanity, so that the darkness of differences among men may be dissipated,\r\nand the pavilion of the unity of nations may cast its shadow over all\r\nregions. Without such unity, rest and comfort, peace and universal\r\nreconciliation are unachievable. This illumined century needeth and\r\ncalleth for its fulfilment. In every century a particular and central\r\ntheme is, in accordance with the requirements of that century, confirmed\r\nby God. In this illumined age that which is confirmed is the oneness of\r\nthe world of humanity. Every soul who serveth this oneness will\r\nundoubtedly be assisted and confirmed.\r\n\r\nI hope that in the assemblies thou mayest sing praises with a sweet melody\r\nand thus become the cause of joy and gladness to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78: O THOU WHO ART PURE IN HEART, SANCTIFIED IN SPIRIT, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art pure in heart, sanctified in spirit, peerless in character,\r\nbeauteous in face! Thy photograph hath been received revealing thy\r\nphysical frame in the utmost grace and the best appearance. Thou art dark\r\nin countenance and bright in character. Thou art like unto the pupil of\r\nthe eye which is dark in colour, yet it is the fount of light and the\r\nrevealer of the contingent world.\r\n\r\nI have not forgotten nor will I forget thee. I beseech God that He may\r\ngraciously make thee the sign of His bounty amidst mankind, illumine thy\r\nface with the light of such blessings as are vouchsafed by the merciful\r\nLord, single thee out for His love in this age which is distinguished\r\namong all the past ages and centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n79: O RESPECTED PERSONAGE! I HAVE READ YOUR WORK, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO respected personage! I have read your work, The Gospel of Wealth,(34)\r\nand noted therein truly apposite and sound recommendations for easing the\r\nlot of humankind.\r\n\r\nTo state the matter briefly, the Teachings of Baha'u'llah advocate\r\nvoluntary sharing, and this is a greater thing than the equalization of\r\nwealth. For equalization must be imposed from without, while sharing is a\r\nmatter of free choice.\r\n\r\nMan reacheth perfection through good deeds, voluntarily performed, not\r\nthrough good deeds the doing of which was forced upon him. And sharing is\r\na personally chosen righteous act: that is, the rich should extend\r\nassistance to the poor, they should expend their substance for the poor,\r\nbut of their own free will, and not because the poor have gained this end\r\nby force. For the harvest of force is turmoil and the ruin of the social\r\norder. On the other hand voluntary sharing, the freely-chosen expending of\r\none's substance, leadeth to society's comfort and peace. It lighteth up\r\nthe world; it bestoweth honour upon humankind.\r\n\r\nI have seen the good effects of your own philanthropy in America, in\r\nvarious universities, peace gatherings, and associations for the promotion\r\nof learning, as I travelled from city to city. Wherefore do I pray on your\r\nbehalf that you shall ever be encompassed by the bounties and blessings of\r\nheaven, and shall perform many philanthropic deeds in East and West. Thus\r\nmay you gleam as a lighted taper in the Kingdom of God, may attain honour\r\nand everlasting life, and shine out as a bright star on the horizon of\r\neternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n80: O THOU WHO ART TURNING THY FACE TO GOD! THY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art turning thy face to God! Thy letter was received. From its\r\ncontents it became known that thy wish is to serve the poor. What wish\r\nbetter than this! Those souls who are of the Kingdom eagerly wish to be of\r\nservice to the poor, to sympathize with them, to show kindness to the\r\nmiserable and to make their lives fruitful. Happy art thou that thou hast\r\nsuch a wish.\r\n\r\nConvey on my behalf to thy two children the utmost kindness and love.\r\nTheir letters have been received but, as I have no time, separate letters\r\ncannot be written at present. Show them on my behalf the utmost kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n81: THOSE SOULS WHO DURING THE WAR HAVE SERVED THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThose souls who during the war have served the poor and have been in the\r\nRed Cross Mission work, their services are accepted at the Kingdom of God\r\nand are the cause of their everlasting life. Convey to them these glad\r\ntidings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n82: O THOU WHO ART FIRM IN THE COVENANT, THY LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art firm in the Covenant, thy letter was received. Thou hast\r\nexerted a great effort for that prisoner, perchance it may prove to be\r\nfruitful. Tell him, however: 'The denizens of the world are confined in\r\nthe prison of nature--a prison that is continuous and eternal. If thou art\r\nat present restrained within the limits of a temporary prison, be not\r\ngrieved at this; my hope is that thou mayest be emancipated from the\r\nprison of nature and may attain unto the court of everlasting life. Pray\r\nto God day and night and beg forgiveness and pardon. The omnipotence of\r\nGod shall solve every difficulty.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n83: CONVEY ON BEHALF OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA TO THY RESPECTED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nConvey on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Baha to thy respected wife my Abha greetings,\r\nand say: 'Kindness, training and education extended to prisoners is\r\nexceedingly important. Therefore as thou hast exerted an effort in this,\r\nhast awakened some of them, and hast been the cause of the turning of\r\ntheir faces to the divine Kingdom, this praiseworthy deed is highly\r\nacceptable. Assuredly persevere. Convey on my behalf to the two prisoners\r\nin San Quentin the utmost kindness, and tell them: 'That prison in the\r\nsight of wise souls is a school of training and development. Ye must\r\nstrive with heart and soul that ye may become renowned in character and\r\nknowledge.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n84: O THOU DEAR HANDMAID OF GOD! THY LETTER HATH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou dear handmaid of God! Thy letter hath been received, and its\r\ncontents were noted.\r\n\r\nMarriage, among the mass of the people, is a physical bond, and this union\r\ncan only be temporary, since it is foredoomed to a physical separation at\r\nthe close.\r\n\r\nAmong the people of Baha, however, marriage must be a union of the body\r\nand of the spirit as well, for here both husband and wife are aglow with\r\nthe same wine, both are enamoured of the same matchless Face, both live\r\nand move through the same spirit, both are illumined by the same glory.\r\nThis connection between them is a spiritual one, hence it is a bond that\r\nwill abide forever. Likewise do they enjoy strong and lasting ties in the\r\nphysical world as well, for if the marriage is based both on the spirit\r\nand the body, that union is a true one, hence it will endure. If, however,\r\nthe bond is physical and nothing more, it is sure to be only temporary,\r\nand must inexorably end in separation.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the people of Baha undertake to marry, the union must be\r\na true relationship, a spiritual coming together as well as a physical\r\none, so that throughout every phase of life, and in all the worlds of God,\r\ntheir union will endure; for this real oneness is a gleaming out of the\r\nlove of God.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when any souls grow to be true believers, they will\r\nattain a spiritual relationship with one another, and show forth a\r\ntenderness which is not of this world. They will, all of them, become\r\nelated from a draught of divine love, and that union of theirs, that\r\nconnection, will also abide forever. Souls, that is, who will consign\r\ntheir own selves to oblivion, strip from themselves the defects of\r\nhumankind, and unchain themselves from human bondage, will beyond any\r\ndoubt be illumined with the heavenly splendours of oneness, and will all\r\nattain unto real union in the world that dieth not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n85: AS FOR THE QUESTION REGARDING MARRIAGE UNDER THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the question regarding marriage under the Law of God: first thou\r\nmust choose one who is pleasing to thee, and then the matter is subject to\r\nthe consent of father and mother. Before thou makest thy choice, they have\r\nno right to interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n86: BAHA'I MARRIAGE IS THE COMMITMENT OF THE TWO ...\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'i marriage is the commitment of the two parties one to the other, and\r\ntheir mutual attachment of mind and heart. Each must, however, exercise\r\nthe utmost care to become thoroughly acquainted with the character of the\r\nother, that the binding covenant between them may be a tie that will\r\nendure forever. Their purpose must be this: to become loving companions\r\nand comrades and at one with each other for time and eternity....\r\n\r\nThe true marriage of Baha'is is this, that husband and wife should be\r\nunited both physically and spiritually, that they may ever improve the\r\nspiritual life of each other, and may enjoy everlasting unity throughout\r\nall the worlds of God. This is Baha'i marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n87: O THOU MEMENTO OF HIM WHO DIED FOR THE BLESSED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou memento of him who died for the Blessed Beauty! In recent days, the\r\njoyful news of thy marriage to that luminous leaf hath been received, and\r\nhath infinitely gladdened the hearts of the people of God. With all\r\nhumility, prayers of supplication have been offered at the Holy Threshold,\r\nthat this marriage may be a harbinger of joy to the friends, that it may\r\nbe a loving bond for all eternity, and yield everlasting benefits and\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nFrom separation doth every kind of hurt and harm proceed, but the union of\r\ncreated things doth ever yield most laudable results. From the pairing of\r\neven the smallest particles in the world of being are the grace and bounty\r\nof God made manifest; and the higher the degree, the more momentous is the\r\nunion. 'Glory be to Him Who hath created all the pairs, of such things as\r\nearth produceth, and out of men themselves, and of things beyond their\r\nken.'(35) And above all other unions is that between human beings,\r\nespecially when it cometh to pass in the love of God. Thus is the primal\r\noneness made to appear; thus is laid the foundation of love in the spirit.\r\nIt is certain that such a marriage as yours will cause the bestowals of\r\nGod to be revealed. Wherefore do we offer you felicitations and call down\r\nblessings upon you and beg of the Blessed Beauty, through His aid and\r\nfavour, to make that wedding feast a joy to all and adorn it with the\r\nharmony of Heaven.\r\n\r\nO my Lord, O my Lord! These two bright orbs are wedded in Thy love,\r\nconjoined in servitude to Thy Holy Threshold, united in ministering to Thy\r\nCause. Make Thou this marriage to be as threading lights of Thine\r\nabounding grace, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, and luminous rays of Thy\r\nbestowals, O Thou the Beneficent, the Ever-Giving, that there may branch\r\nout from this great tree boughs that will grow green and flourishing\r\nthrough the gifts that rain down from Thy clouds of grace.\r\n\r\nVerily Thou art the Generous, verily Thou art the Almighty, verily Thou\r\nart the Compassionate, the All-Merciful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n88: O YE MY TWO BELOVED CHILDREN! THE NEWS OF YOUR ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye my two beloved children! The news of your union, as soon as it\r\nreached me, imparted infinite joy and gratitude. Praise be to God, those\r\ntwo faithful birds have sought shelter in one nest. I beseech God that He\r\nmay enable them to raise an honoured family, for the importance of\r\nmarriage lieth in the bringing up of a richly blessed family, so that with\r\nentire gladness they may, even as candles, illuminate the world. For the\r\nenlightenment of the world dependeth upon the existence of man. If man did\r\nnot exist in this world, it would have been like a tree without fruit. My\r\nhope is that you both may become even as one tree, and may, through the\r\noutpourings of the cloud of loving-kindness, acquire freshness and charm,\r\nand may blossom and yield fruit, so that your line may eternally endure.\r\n\r\nUpon ye be the Glory of the Most Glorious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n89: O THOU WHO ART FIRM IN THE COVENANT! THE LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art firm in the Covenant! The letter thou hadst written on 2\r\nMay 1919 was received. Praise thou God that in tests thou art firm and\r\nsteadfast and art holding fast to the Abha Kingdom. Thou art not shaken by\r\nany affliction or disturbed by any calamity. Not until man is tried doth\r\nthe pure gold distinctly separate from the dross. Torment is the fire of\r\ntest wherein the pure gold shineth resplendently and the impurity is\r\nburned and blackened. At present thou art, praise be to God, firm and\r\nsteadfast in tests and trials and art not shaken by them.\r\n\r\nThy wife is not in harmony with thee, but praise be to God, the Blessed\r\nBeauty is pleased with thee and is conferring upon thee the utmost bounty\r\nand blessings. But still try to be patient with thy wife, perchance she\r\nmay be transformed and her heart may be illumined. The contribution thou\r\nhast made for teaching is highly acceptable and it shall be eternally\r\nmentioned in the divine Kingdom for it is the cause of the diffusion of\r\nfragrances and the exaltation of the Word of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n90: O GOD, MY GOD! THIS THY HANDMAID IS CALLING ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO God, my God! This Thy handmaid is calling upon Thee, trusting in Thee,\r\nturning her face unto Thee, imploring Thee to shed Thy heavenly bounties\r\nupon her, and to disclose unto her Thy spiritual mysteries, and to cast\r\nupon her the lights of Thy Godhead.\r\n\r\nO my Lord! Make the eyes of my husband to see. Rejoice Thou his heart with\r\nthe light of the knowledge of Thee, draw Thou his mind unto Thy luminous\r\nbeauty, cheer Thou his spirit by revealing unto him Thy manifest\r\nsplendours.\r\n\r\nO my Lord! Lift Thou the veil from before his sight. Rain down Thy\r\nplenteous bounties upon him, intoxicate him with the wine of love for\r\nThee, make him one of Thy angels whose feet walk upon this earth even as\r\ntheir souls are soaring through the high heavens. Cause him to become a\r\nbrilliant lamp, shining out with the light of Thy wisdom in the midst of\r\nThy people.\r\n\r\nVerily Thou art the Precious, the Ever-Bestowing, the Open of Hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n91: O THOU WHO HAST BOWED THYSELF DOWN IN PRAYER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who hast bowed thyself down in prayer before the Kingdom of God!\r\nBlessed art thou, for the beauty of the divine Countenance hath enraptured\r\nthy heart, and the light of inner wisdom hath filled it full, and within\r\nit shineth the brightness of the Kingdom. Know thou that God is with thee\r\nunder all conditions, and that He guardeth thee from the changes and\r\nchances of this world and hath made thee a handmaid in His mighty\r\nvineyard....\r\n\r\nAs to thy respected husband: it is incumbent upon thee to treat him with\r\ngreat kindness, to consider his wishes and be conciliatory with him at all\r\ntimes, till he seeth that because thou hast directed thyself toward the\r\nKingdom of God, thy tenderness for him and thy love for God have but\r\nincreased, as well as thy concern for his wishes under all conditions.\r\n\r\nI beg of the Almighty to keep thee firmly established in His love, and\r\never shedding abroad the sweet breaths of holiness in all those regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n92: O YE TWO BELIEVERS IN GOD! THE LORD, PEERLESS IS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye two believers in God! The Lord, peerless is He, hath made woman and\r\nman to abide with each other in the closest companionship, and to be even\r\nas a single soul. They are two helpmates, two intimate friends, who should\r\nbe concerned about the welfare of each other.\r\n\r\nIf they live thus, they will pass through this world with perfect\r\ncontentment, bliss, and peace of heart, and become the object of divine\r\ngrace and favour in the Kingdom of heaven. But if they do other than this,\r\nthey will live out their lives in great bitterness, longing at every\r\nmoment for death, and will be shamefaced in the heavenly realm.\r\n\r\nStrive, then, to abide, heart and soul, with each other as two doves in\r\nthe nest, for this is to be blessed in both worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n93: O THOU MAIDSERVANT OF GOD! EVERY WOMAN WHO ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou maidservant of God! Every woman who becometh the maidservant of God\r\noutshineth in glory the empresses of the world, for she is related to God,\r\nand her sovereignty is everlasting, whereas a handful of dust will\r\nobliterate the name and fame of those empresses. In other words, as soon\r\nas they go down to the grave they are reduced to naught. The maidservants\r\nof God's Kingdom, on the other hand, enjoy eternal sovereignty unaffected\r\nby the passing of ages and generations.\r\n\r\nConsider how many empresses have come and gone since the time of Christ.\r\nEach was the ruler of a country but now all trace and name of them is\r\nlost, while Mary Magdalene, who was only a peasant and a maidservant of\r\nGod, still shineth from the horizon of everlasting glory. Strive thou,\r\ntherefore, to remain the maidservant of God.\r\n\r\nThou hast praised the Convention. This Convention shall acquire great\r\nimportance in future, for it is serving the divine Kingdom and the world\r\nof mankind. It promulgateth universal peace and layeth the basis of the\r\noneness of mankind; it freeth the souls from religious, racial and worldly\r\nprejudices and gathereth them under the shade of the one-coloured pavilion\r\nof God. Praise thou God, therefore, that thou hast attended such a\r\nConvention and hast listened to the divine Teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n94: O HANDMAIDS OF THE BEAUTY OF ABHA! YOUR LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO handmaids of the beauty of Abha! Your letter hath come, and its perusal\r\nbrought great joy. Praised be God, the women believers have organized\r\nmeetings where they will learn how to teach the Faith, will spread the\r\nsweet savours of the Teachings and make plans for training the children.\r\n\r\nThis gathering must be completely spiritual. That is, the discussions must\r\nbe confined to marshalling clear and conclusive proofs that the Sun of\r\nTruth hath indeed arisen. And further, those present should concern\r\nthemselves with every means of training the girl children; with teaching\r\nthe various branches of knowledge, good behaviour, a proper way of life,\r\nthe cultivation of a good character, chastity and constancy, perseverance,\r\nstrength, determination, firmness of purpose; with household management,\r\nthe education of children, and whatever especially applieth to the needs\r\nof girls--to the end that these girls, reared in the stronghold of all\r\nperfections, and with the protection of a goodly character, will, when\r\nthey themselves become mothers, bring up their children from earliest\r\ninfancy to have a good character and conduct themselves well.\r\n\r\nLet them also study whatever will nurture the health of the body and its\r\nphysical soundness, and how to guard their children from disease.\r\n\r\nWhen matters are thus well arranged, every child will become a peerless\r\nplant in the gardens of the Abha Paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n95: O HANDMAIDS OF THE LORD! THE SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLAGE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO handmaids of the Lord! The spiritual assemblage that ye established in\r\nthat illumined city is most propitious. Ye have made great strides; ye\r\nhave surpassed the others, have arisen to serve the Holy Threshold, and\r\nhave won heavenly bestowals. Now with all spiritual zeal must ye gather in\r\nthat enlightened assemblage and recite the Holy Writings and engage in\r\nremembering the Lord. Set ye forth His arguments and proofs. Work ye for\r\nthe guidance of the women in that land, teach the young girls and the\r\nchildren, so that the mothers may educate their little ones from their\r\nearliest days, thoroughly train them, rear them to have a goodly character\r\nand good morals, guide them to all the virtues of humankind, prevent the\r\ndevelopment of any behaviour that would be worthy of blame, and foster\r\nthem in the embrace of Baha'i education. Thus shall these tender infants\r\nbe nurtured at the breast of the knowledge of God and His love. Thus shall\r\nthey grow and flourish, and be taught righteousness and the dignity of\r\nhumankind, resolution and the will to strive and to endure. Thus shall\r\nthey learn perseverance in all things, the will to advance, high\r\nmindedness and high resolve, chastity and purity of life. Thus shall they\r\nbe enabled to carry to a successful conclusion whatsoever they undertake.\r\n\r\nLet the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the education of\r\nchildren is of the first importance. Let them put forth every effort in\r\nthis regard, for when the bough is green and tender it will grow in\r\nwhatever way ye train it. Therefore is it incumbent upon the mothers to\r\nrear their little ones even as a gardener tendeth his young plants. Let\r\nthem strive by day and by night to establish within their children faith\r\nand certitude, the fear of God, the love of the Beloved of the worlds, and\r\nall good qualities and traits. Whensoever a mother seeth that her child\r\nhath done well, let her praise and applaud him and cheer his heart; and if\r\nthe slightest undesirable trait should manifest itself, let her counsel\r\nthe child and punish him, and use means based on reason, even a slight\r\nverbal chastisement should this be necessary. It is not, however,\r\npermissible to strike a child, or vilify him, for the child's character\r\nwill be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or verbal abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n96: O HANDMAIDS OF THE MERCIFUL! RENDER YE THANKS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO handmaids of the Merciful! Render ye thanks unto the Ancient Beauty that\r\nye have been raised up and gathered together in this mightiest of\r\ncenturies, this most illumined of ages. As befitting thanks for such a\r\nbounty, stand ye staunch and strong in the Covenant and, following the\r\nprecepts of God and the holy Law, suckle your children from their infancy\r\nwith the milk of a universal education, and rear them so that from their\r\nearliest days, within their inmost heart, their very nature, a way of life\r\nwill be firmly established that will conform to the divine Teachings in\r\nall things.\r\n\r\nFor mothers are the first educators, the first mentors; and truly it is\r\nthe mothers who determine the happiness, the future greatness, the\r\ncourteous ways and learning and judgement, the understanding and the faith\r\nof their little ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n97: THERE ARE CERTAIN PILLARS WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain pillars which have been established as the unshakeable\r\nsupports of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is learning and the\r\nuse of the mind, the expansion of consciousness, and insight into the\r\nrealities of the universe and the hidden mysteries of Almighty God.\r\n\r\nTo promote knowledge is thus an inescapable duty imposed on every one of\r\nthe friends of God. It is incumbent upon that Spiritual Assembly, that\r\nassemblage of God, to exert every effort to educate the children, so that\r\nfrom infancy they will be trained in Baha'i conduct and the ways of God,\r\nand will, even as young plants, thrive and flourish in the soft-flowing\r\nwaters that are the counsels and admonitions of the Blessed Beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n98: WERE THERE NO EDUCATOR, ALL SOULS WOULD REMAIN ...\r\n\r\n\r\nWere there no educator, all souls would remain savage, and were it not for\r\nthe teacher, the children would be ignorant creatures.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that, in this new cycle, education and training are\r\nrecorded in the Book of God as obligatory and not voluntary. That is, it\r\nis enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive with all\r\neffort to train the daughter and the son, to nurse them from the breast of\r\nknowledge and to rear them in the bosom of sciences and arts. Should they\r\nneglect this matter, they shall be held responsible and worthy of reproach\r\nin the presence of the stern Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n99: THOU DIDST WRITE AS TO THE CHILDREN: FROM THE VERY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThou didst write as to the children: from the very beginning, the children\r\nmust receive divine education and must continually be reminded to remember\r\ntheir God. Let the love of God pervade their inmost being, commingled with\r\ntheir mother's milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100: MY WISH IS THAT THESE CHILDREN SHOULD RECEIVE A ...\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wish is that these children should receive a Baha'i education, so that\r\nthey may progress both here and in the Kingdom, and rejoice thy heart.\r\n\r\nIn a time to come, morals will degenerate to an extreme degree. It is\r\nessential that children be reared in the Baha'i way, that they may find\r\nhappiness both in this world and the next. If not, they shall be beset by\r\nsorrows and troubles, for human happiness is founded upon spiritual\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n101: O YE WHO HAVE PEACE OF SOUL! AMONG THE DIVINE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye who have peace of soul! Among the divine Texts as set forth in the\r\nMost Holy Book and also in other Tablets is this: it is incumbent upon the\r\nfather and mother to train their children both in good conduct and the\r\nstudy of books; study, that is, to the degree required, so that no child,\r\nwhether girl or boy, will remain illiterate. Should the father fail in his\r\nduty he must be compelled to discharge his responsibility, and should he\r\nbe unable to comply, let the House of Justice take over the education of\r\nthe children; in no case is a child to be left without an education. This\r\nis one of the stringent and inescapable commandments to neglect which\r\nwould draw down the wrathful indignation of Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102: O TRUE COMPANIONS! ALL HUMANKIND ARE AS CHILDREN ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO true companions! All humankind are as children in a school, and the\r\nDawning-Points of Light, the Sources of divine revelation, are the\r\nteachers, wondrous and without peer. In the school of realities they\r\neducate these sons and daughters, according to teachings from God, and\r\nfoster them in the bosom of grace, so that they may develop along every\r\nline, show forth the excellent gifts and blessings of the Lord, and\r\ncombine human perfections; that they may advance in all aspects of human\r\nendeavour, whether outward or inward, hidden or visible, material or\r\nspiritual, until they make of this mortal world a widespread mirror, to\r\nreflect that other world which dieth not.\r\n\r\nO ye friends of God! Because, in this most momentous of ages, the Sun of\r\nTruth hath risen at the highest point of the spring equinox, and cast its\r\nrays on every clime, it shall kindle such tremulous excitement, it shall\r\nrelease such vibrations in the world of being, it shall stimulate such\r\ngrowth and development, it shall stream out with such a glory of light,\r\nand clouds of grace shall pour down such plentiful waters, and fields and\r\nplains shall teem with such a galaxy of sweet-smelling plants and blooms,\r\nthat this lowly earth will become the Abha Kingdom, and this nether world\r\nthe world above. Then will this fleck of dust be as the vast circle of the\r\nskies, this human place the palace-court of God, this spot of clay the\r\ndayspring of the endless favours of the Lord of Lords.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O loved ones of God! Make ye a mighty effort till you\r\nyourselves betoken this advancement and all these confirmations, and\r\nbecome focal centres of God's blessings, daysprings of the light of His\r\nunity, promoters of the gifts and graces of civilized life. Be ye in that\r\nland vanguards of the perfections of humankind; carry forward the various\r\nbranches of knowledge, be active and progressive in the field of\r\ninventions and the arts. Endeavour to rectify the conduct of men, and seek\r\nto excel the whole world in moral character. While the children are yet in\r\ntheir infancy feed them from the breast of heavenly grace, foster them in\r\nthe cradle of all excellence, rear them in the embrace of bounty. Give\r\nthem the advantage of every useful kind of knowledge. Let them share in\r\nevery new and rare and wondrous craft and art. Bring them up to work and\r\nstrive, and accustom them to hardship. Teach them to dedicate their lives\r\nto matters of great import, and inspire them to undertake studies that\r\nwill benefit mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n103: THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF CHILDREN IS AMONG ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe education and training of children is among the most meritorious acts\r\nof humankind and draweth down the grace and favour of the All-Merciful,\r\nfor education is the indispensable foundation of all human excellence and\r\nalloweth man to work his way to the heights of abiding glory. If a child\r\nbe trained from his infancy, he will, through the loving care of the Holy\r\nGardener, drink in the crystal waters of the spirit and of knowledge, like\r\na young tree amid the rilling brooks. And certainly he will gather to\r\nhimself the bright rays of the Sun of Truth, and through its light and\r\nheat will grow ever fresh and fair in the garden of life.\r\n\r\nTherefore must the mentor be a doctor as well: that is, he must, in\r\ninstructing the child, remedy its faults; must give him learning, and at\r\nthe same time rear him to have a spiritual nature. Let the teacher be a\r\ndoctor to the character of the child, thus will he heal the spiritual\r\nailments of the children of men.\r\n\r\nIf, in this momentous task, a mighty effort be exerted, the world of\r\nhumanity will shine out with other adornings, and shed the fairest light.\r\nThen will this darksome place grow luminous, and this abode of earth turn\r\ninto Heaven. The very demons will change to angels then, and wolves to\r\nshepherds of the flock, and the wild-dog pack to gazelles that pasture on\r\nthe plains of oneness, and ravening beasts to peaceful herds, and birds of\r\nprey, with talons sharp as knives, to songsters warbling their sweet\r\nnative notes.\r\n\r\nFor the inner reality of man is a demarcation line between the shadow and\r\nthe light, a place where the two seas meet;(36) it is the lowest point on\r\nthe arc of descent,(37) and therefore is it capable of gaining all the\r\ngrades above. With education it can achieve all excellence; devoid of\r\neducation it will stay on, at the lowest point of imperfection.\r\n\r\nEvery child is potentially the light of the world--and at the same time its\r\ndarkness; wherefore must the question of education be accounted as of\r\nprimary importance. From his infancy, the child must be nursed at the\r\nbreast of God's love, and nurtured in the embrace of His knowledge, that\r\nhe may radiate light, grow in spirituality, be filled with wisdom and\r\nlearning, and take on the characteristics of the angelic host.\r\n\r\nSince ye have been assigned to this holy task, ye must therefore exert\r\nevery effort to make that school famed in all respects throughout the\r\nworld; to make it the cause of exalting the Word of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n104: O LOVED ONES OF GOD AND HANDMAIDS OF THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO loved ones of God and handmaids of the Merciful! A large body of\r\nscholars is of the opinion that variations among minds and differing\r\ndegrees of perception are due to differences in education, training and\r\nculture. That is, they believe that minds are equal to begin with, but\r\nthat training and education will result in mental variations and differing\r\nlevels of intelligence, and that such variations are not an inherent\r\ncomponent of the individuality but are the result of education: that no\r\none hath any inborn superiority over another....\r\n\r\nThe Manifestations of God are likewise in agreement with the view that\r\neducation exerteth the strongest possible influence on humankind. They\r\naffirm, however, that differences in the level of intelligence are innate;\r\nand this fact is obvious, and not worth debating. For we see that children\r\nof the same age, the same country, the same race, indeed of the same\r\nfamily, and trained by the same individual, still are different as to the\r\ndegree of their comprehension and intelligence. One will make rapid\r\nprogress, one will receive instruction only gradually, one will remain at\r\nthe lowest stage of all. For no matter how much you may polish a shell, it\r\nwill not turn into a gleaming pearl, nor can you change a dull pebble into\r\na gem whose pure rays will light the world. Never, through training and\r\ncultivation, will the colocynth and the bitter tree(38) change into the\r\nTree of Blessedness.(39) That is to say, education cannot alter the inner\r\nessence of a man, but it doth exert tremendous influence, and with this\r\npower it can bring forth from the individual whatever perfections and\r\ncapacities are deposited within him. A grain of wheat, when cultivated by\r\nthe farmer, will yield a whole harvest, and a seed, through the gardener's\r\ncare, will grow into a great tree. Thanks to a teacher's loving efforts,\r\nthe children of the primary school may reach the highest levels of\r\nachievement; indeed, his benefactions may lift some child of small account\r\nto an exalted throne. Thus is it clearly demonstrated that by their\r\nessential nature, minds vary as to their capacity, while education also\r\nplayeth a great role and exerteth a powerful effect on their development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n105: AS TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT MATERIAL CIVILIZATION ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the difference between that material civilization now prevailing,\r\nand the divine civilization which will be one of the benefits to derive\r\nfrom the House of Justice, it is this: material civilization, through the\r\npower of punitive and retaliatory laws, restraineth the people from\r\ncriminal acts; and notwithstanding this, while laws to retaliate against\r\nand punish a man are continually proliferating, as ye can see, no laws\r\nexist to reward him. In all the cities of Europe and America, vast\r\nbuildings have been erected to serve as jails for the criminals.\r\n\r\nDivine civilization, however, so traineth every member of society that no\r\none, with the exception of a negligible few, will undertake to commit a\r\ncrime. There is thus a great difference between the prevention of crime\r\nthrough measures that are violent and retaliatory, and so training the\r\npeople, and enlightening them, and spiritualizing them, that without any\r\nfear of punishment or vengeance to come, they will shun all criminal acts.\r\nThey will, indeed, look upon the very commission of a crime as a great\r\ndisgrace and in itself the harshest of punishments. They will become\r\nenamoured of human perfections, and will consecrate their lives to\r\nwhatever will bring light to the world and will further those qualities\r\nwhich are acceptable at the Holy Threshold of God.\r\n\r\nSee then how wide is the difference between material civilization and\r\ndivine. With force and punishments, material civilization seeketh to\r\nrestrain the people from mischief, from inflicting harm on society and\r\ncommitting crimes. But in a divine civilization, the individual is so\r\nconditioned that with no fear of punishment, he shunneth the perpetration\r\nof crimes, seeth the crime itself as the severest of torments, and with\r\nalacrity and joy, setteth himself to acquiring the virtues of humankind,\r\nto furthering human progress, and to spreading light across the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n106: AMONG THE GREATEST OF ALL SERVICES THAT CAN POSSIBLY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the greatest of all services that can possibly be rendered by man to\r\nAlmighty God is the education and training of children, young plants of\r\nthe Abha Paradise, so that these children, fostered by grace in the way of\r\nsalvation, growing like pearls of divine bounty in the shell of education,\r\nwill one day bejewel the crown of abiding glory.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, very difficult to undertake this service, even harder to\r\nsucceed in it. I hope that thou wilt acquit thyself well in this most\r\nimportant of tasks, and successfully carry the day, and become an ensign\r\nof God's abounding grace; that these children, reared one and all in the\r\nholy Teachings, will develop natures like unto the sweet airs that blow\r\nacross the gardens of the All-Glorious, and will waft their fragrance\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n107: IT IS THE HOPE OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA THAT THOSE YOUTHFUL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the hope of 'Abdu'l-Baha that those youthful souls in the schoolroom\r\nof the deeper knowledge will be tended by one who traineth them to love.\r\nMay they all, throughout the reaches of the spirit, learn well of the\r\nhidden mysteries; so well that in the Kingdom of the All-Glorious, each\r\none of them, even as a nightingale endowed with speech, will cry out the\r\nsecrets of the Heavenly Realm, and like unto a longing lover pour forth\r\nhis sore need and utter want of the Beloved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n108: YE SHOULD CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF GOODLY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nYe should consider the question of goodly character as of the first\r\nimportance. It is incumbent upon every father and mother to counsel their\r\nchildren over a long period, and guide them unto those things which lead\r\nto everlasting honour.\r\n\r\nEncourage ye the school children, from their earliest years, to deliver\r\nspeeches of high quality, so that in their leisure time they will engage\r\nin giving cogent and effective talks, expressing themselves with clarity\r\nand eloquence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n109: O YE RECIPIENTS OF THE FAVOURS OF GOD! IN THIS NEW ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye recipients of the favours of God! In this new and wondrous Age, the\r\nunshakeable foundation is the teaching of sciences and arts. According to\r\nexplicit Holy Texts, every child must be taught crafts and arts, to the\r\ndegree that is needful. Wherefore, in every city and village, schools must\r\nbe established and every child in that city or village is to engage in\r\nstudy to the necessary degree.\r\n\r\nIt followeth that whatever soul shall offer his aid to bring this about\r\nwill assuredly be accepted at the heavenly Threshold, and extolled by the\r\nCompany on high.\r\n\r\nSince ye have striven hard toward this all-important end, it is my hope\r\nthat ye will reap your reward from the Lord of clear tokens and signs, and\r\nthat the glances of heavenly grace will turn your way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n110: AS TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE SCHOOLS: IF POSSIBLE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the organization of the schools: if possible the children should all\r\nwear the same kind of clothing, even if the fabric is varied. It is\r\npreferable that the fabric as well should be uniform; if, however, this is\r\nnot possible, there is no harm done. The more cleanly the pupils are, the\r\nbetter; they should be immaculate. The school must be located in a place\r\nwhere the air is delicate and pure. The children must be carefully trained\r\nto be most courteous and well-behaved. They must be constantly encouraged\r\nand made eager to gain all the summits of human accomplishment, so that\r\nfrom their earliest years they will be taught to have high aims, to\r\nconduct themselves well, to be chaste, pure, and undefiled, and will learn\r\nto be of powerful resolve and firm of purpose in all things. Let them not\r\njest and trifle, but earnestly advance unto their goals, so that in every\r\nsituation they will be found resolute and firm.\r\n\r\nTraining in morals and good conduct is far more important than book\r\nlearning. A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of good character,\r\nwell-behaved--even though he be ignorant--is preferable to a child that is\r\nrude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in all the\r\nsciences and arts. The reason for this is that the child who conducts\r\nhimself well, even though he be ignorant, is of benefit to others, while\r\nan ill-natured, ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful to others, even\r\nthough he be learned. If, however, the child be trained to be both learned\r\nand good, the result is light upon light.\r\n\r\nChildren are even as a branch that is fresh and green; they will grow up\r\nin whatever way ye train them. Take the utmost care to give them high\r\nideals and goals, so that once they come of age, they will cast their\r\nbeams like brilliant candles on the world, and will not be defiled by\r\nlusts and passions in the way of animals, heedless and unaware, but\r\ninstead will set their hearts on achieving everlasting honour and\r\nacquiring all the excellences of humankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n111: THE ROOT CAUSE OF WRONGDOING IS IGNORANCE, AND ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and we must therefore hold fast\r\nto the tools of perception and knowledge. Good character must be taught.\r\nLight must be spread afar, so that, in the school of humanity, all may\r\nacquire the heavenly characteristics of the spirit, and see for themselves\r\nbeyond any doubt that there is no fiercer hell, no more fiery abyss, than\r\nto possess a character that is evil and unsound; no more darksome pit nor\r\nloathsome torment than to show forth qualities which deserve to be\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nThe individual must be educated to such a high degree that he would rather\r\nhave his throat cut than tell a lie, and would think it easier to be\r\nslashed with a sword or pierced with a spear than to utter calumny or be\r\ncarried away by wrath.\r\n\r\nThus will be kindled the sense of human dignity and pride, to burn away\r\nthe reapings of lustful appetites. Then will each one of God's beloved\r\nshine out as a bright moon with qualities of the spirit, and the\r\nrelationship of each to the Sacred Threshold of his Lord will be not\r\nillusory but sound and real, will be as the very foundation of the\r\nbuilding, not some embellishment on its facade.\r\n\r\nIt followeth that the children's school must be a place of utmost\r\ndiscipline and order, that instruction must be thorough, and provision\r\nmust be made for the rectification and refinement of character; so that,\r\nin his earliest years, within the very essence of the child, the divine\r\nfoundation will be laid and the structure of holiness raised up.\r\n\r\nKnow that this matter of instruction, of character rectification and\r\nrefinement, of heartening and encouraging the child, is of the utmost\r\nimportance, for such are basic principles of God.\r\n\r\nThus, if God will, out of these spiritual schools illumined children will\r\narise, adorned with all the fairest virtues of humankind, and will shed\r\ntheir light not only across Persia, but around the world.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to teach the individual and refine his character\r\nonce puberty is passed. By then, as experience hath shown, even if every\r\neffort be exerted to modify some tendency of his, it all availeth nothing.\r\nHe may, perhaps, improve somewhat today; but let a few days pass and he\r\nforgetteth, and turneth backward to his habitual condition and accustomed\r\nways. Therefore it is in early childhood that a firm foundation must be\r\nlaid. While the branch is green and tender it can easily be made straight.\r\n\r\nOur meaning is that qualities of the spirit are the basic and divine\r\nfoundation, and adorn the true essence of man; and knowledge is the cause\r\nof human progress. The beloved of God must attach great importance to this\r\nmatter, and carry it forward with enthusiasm and zeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n112: IN THIS HOLY CAUSE THE QUESTION OF ORPHANS HATH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this holy Cause the question of orphans hath the utmost importance. The\r\ngreatest consideration must be shown towards orphans; they must be taught,\r\ntrained and educated. The Teachings of Baha'u'llah, especially, must by\r\nall means be given to them as far as is possible.\r\n\r\nI supplicate God that thou mayest become a kind parent to orphaned\r\nchildren, quickening them with the fragrances of the Holy Spirit, so that\r\nthey will attain the age of maturity as true servants of the world of\r\nhumanity and as bright candles in the assemblage of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n113: O HANDMAID OF GOD!... TO THE MOTHERS MUST BE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God!... To the mothers must be given the divine Teachings\r\nand effective counsel, and they must be encouraged and made eager to train\r\ntheir children, for the mother is the first educator of the child. It is\r\nshe who must, at the very beginning, suckle the newborn at the breast of\r\nGod's Faith and God's Law, that divine love may enter into him even with\r\nhis mother's milk, and be with him till his final breath.\r\n\r\nSo long as the mother faileth to train her children, and start them on a\r\nproper way of life, the training which they receive later on will not take\r\nits full effect. It is incumbent upon the Spiritual Assemblies to provide\r\nthe mothers with a well-planned programme for the education of children,\r\nshowing how, from infancy, the child must be watched over and taught.\r\nThese instructions must be given to every mother to serve her as a guide,\r\nso that each will train and nurture her children in accordance with the\r\nTeachings.\r\n\r\nThus will these young plants in the garden of God's love grow and flourish\r\nunder the warmth of the Sun of Truth, the gentle spring winds of Heaven,\r\nand their mother's guiding hand. Thus, in the Abha Paradise, will each\r\nbecome a tree, bearing his clustered fruit, and each one, in this new and\r\nwondrous season, out of the bounties of the spring, will become possessed\r\nof all beauty and grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n114: O YE LOVING MOTHERS, KNOW YE THAT IN GOD'S SIGHT, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye loving mothers, know ye that in God's sight, the best of all ways to\r\nworship Him is to educate the children and train them in all the\r\nperfections of humankind; and no nobler deed than this can be imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n115: O YE TWO WELL-LOVED HANDMAIDS OF GOD! WHATEVER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye two well-loved handmaids of God! Whatever a man's tongue speaketh,\r\nthat let him prove by his deeds. If he claimeth to be a believer, then let\r\nhim act in accordance with the precepts of the Abha Kingdom.\r\n\r\nPraised be God, ye two have demonstrated the truth of your words by your\r\ndeeds, and have won the confirmations of the Lord God. Every day at first\r\nlight, ye gather the Baha'i children together and teach them the communes\r\nand prayers. This is a most praiseworthy act, and bringeth joy to the\r\nchildren's hearts: that they should, at every morn, turn their faces\r\ntoward the Kingdom and make mention of the Lord and praise His Name, and\r\nin the sweetest of voices, chant and recite.\r\n\r\nThese children are even as young plants, and teaching them the prayers is\r\nas letting the rain pour down upon them, that they may wax tender and\r\nfresh, and the soft breezes of the love of God may blow over them, making\r\nthem to tremble with joy.\r\n\r\nBlessedness awaiteth you, and a fair haven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n116: O THOU DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM! THY LETTERS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou daughter of the Kingdom! Thy letters were received. Their contents\r\nindicated that thy mother hath ascended to the invisible realm and that\r\nthou hast been left alone. Thy wish is to serve thy father, who is dear to\r\nthee, and also to serve the Kingdom of God, and thou art perplexed as to\r\nwhich of the two thou shouldst do. Assuredly engage in service to thy\r\nfather, and as well, whenever thou findest time, diffuse the divine\r\nfragrances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n117: O DEAR ONE OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! BE THE SON OF THY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO dear one of 'Abdu'l-Baha! Be the son of thy father and be the fruit of\r\nthat tree. Be a son that hath been born of his soul and heart and not only\r\nof water and clay. A real son is such a one as hath branched from the\r\nspiritual part of man. I ask God that thou mayest be at all times\r\nconfirmed and strengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n118: O YE YOUNG BAHA'I CHILDREN, YE SEEKERS AFTER TRUE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye young Baha'i children, ye seekers after true understanding and\r\nknowledge! A human being is distinguished from an animal in a number of\r\nways. First of all, he is made in the image of God, in the likeness of the\r\nSupernal Light, even as the Torah saith, 'Let us make man in our image,\r\nafter our likeness.'(40) This divine image betokeneth all the qualities of\r\nperfection whose lights, emanating from the Sun of Truth, illumine the\r\nrealities of men. And among the greatest of these attributes of perfection\r\nare wisdom and knowledge. Ye must therefore put forth a mighty effort,\r\nstriving by night and day and resting not for a moment, to acquire an\r\nabundant share of all the sciences and arts, that the Divine Image, which\r\nshineth out from the Sun of Truth, may illumine the mirror of the hearts\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nIt is the longing desire of 'Abdu'l-Baha to see each one of you accounted\r\nas the foremost professor in the academies, and in the school of inner\r\nsignificances, each one becoming a leader in wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n119: IT IS INCUMBENT UPON BAHA'I CHILDREN TO SURPASS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent upon Baha'i children to surpass other children in the\r\nacquisition of sciences and arts, for they have been cradled in the grace\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nWhatever other children learn in a year, let Baha'i children learn in a\r\nmonth. The heart of 'Abdu'l-Baha longeth, in its love, to find that Baha'i\r\nyoung people, each and all, are known throughout the world for their\r\nintellectual attainments. There is no question but that they will exert\r\nall their efforts, their energies, their sense of pride, to acquire the\r\nsciences and arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n120: O MY DEAR CHILDREN! YOUR LETTER WAS RECEIVED. A ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO my dear children! Your letter was received. A degree of joy was attained\r\nthat is beyond words or writing that, praise be to God, the power of the\r\nKingdom of God hath trained such children who, from their early childhood,\r\neagerly wish to acquire Baha'i education that they may, from the period of\r\ntheir childhood, engage in service to the world of humanity.\r\n\r\nMy highest wish and desire is that ye who are my children may be educated\r\naccording to the teachings of Baha'u'llah and may receive a Baha'i\r\ntraining; that ye may each become a lighted candle in the world of\r\nhumanity, may be devoted to the service of all mankind, may give up your\r\nrest and comfort, so that ye may become the cause of the tranquillity of\r\nthe world of creation.\r\n\r\nSuch is my hope for you and I trust that ye may become the cause of my joy\r\nand gladness in the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n121: O THOU WHOSE YEARS ARE FEW, YET WHOSE MENTAL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou whose years are few, yet whose mental gifts are many! How many a\r\nchild, though young in years, is yet mature and sound in judgement! How\r\nmany an aged person is ignorant and confused! For growth and development\r\ndepend on one's powers of intellect and reason, not on one's age or length\r\nof days.\r\n\r\nAlthough still in the season of childhood, yet hast thou recognized thy\r\nLord, while myriads of women are oblivious of Him and are shut away from\r\nHis heavenly Kingdom and deprived of His bestowals. Render thou thanks\r\nunto thy Lord for this wondrous gift.\r\n\r\nI beg of God to heal thy mother, who is honoured in the Kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n122: AS TO THY QUESTION REGARDING THE EDUCATION OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to thy question regarding the education of children: it behoveth thee\r\nto nurture them at the breast of the love of God, and urge them onward to\r\nthe things of the spirit, that they may turn their faces unto God; that\r\ntheir ways may conform to the rules of good conduct and their character be\r\nsecond to none; that they make their own all the graces and praiseworthy\r\nqualities of humankind; acquire a sound knowledge of the various branches\r\nof learning, so that from the very beginning of life they may become\r\nspiritual beings, dwellers in the Kingdom, enamoured of the sweet breaths\r\nof holiness, and may receive an education religious, spiritual, and of the\r\nHeavenly Realm. Verily will I call upon God to grant them a happy outcome\r\nin this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n123: O THOU WHO GAZEST UPON THE KINGDOM OF GOD! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who gazest upon the Kingdom of God! Thy letter was received and we\r\nnote that thou art engaged in teaching the children of the believers, that\r\nthese tender little ones have been learning The Hidden Words and the\r\nprayers and what it meaneth to be a Baha'i.\r\n\r\nThe instruction of these children is even as the work of a loving gardener\r\nwho tendeth his young plants in the flowering fields of the All-Glorious.\r\nThere is no doubt that it will yield the desired results; especially is\r\nthis true of instruction as to Baha'i obligations and Baha'i conduct, for\r\nthe little children must needs be made aware in their very heart and soul\r\nthat \"Baha'i\" is not just a name but a truth. Every child must be trained\r\nin the things of the spirit, so that he may embody all the virtues and\r\nbecome a source of glory to the Cause of God. Otherwise, the mere word\r\n\"Baha'i\", if it yield no fruit, will come to nothing.\r\n\r\nStrive then to the best of thine ability to let these children know that a\r\nBaha'i is one who embodieth all the perfections, that he must shine out\r\nlike a lighted taper--not be darkness upon darkness and yet bear the name\r\n\"Baha'i\".\r\n\r\nName thou this school the Baha'i Sunday School.(41)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n124: THE SUNDAY SCHOOL FOR THE CHILDREN IN WHICH THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sunday school for the children in which the Tablets and Teachings of\r\nBaha'u'llah are read, and the Word of God is recited for the children is\r\nindeed a blessed thing. Thou must certainly continue this organized\r\nactivity without cessation, and attach importance to it, so that day by\r\nday it may grow and be quickened with the breaths of the Holy Spirit. If\r\nthis activity is well organized, rest thou assured that it will yield\r\ngreat results. Firmness and steadfastness, however, are necessary,\r\notherwise it will continue for some time, but later be gradually\r\nforgotten. Perseverance is an essential condition. In every project\r\nfirmness and steadfastness will undoubtedly lead to good results;\r\notherwise it will exist for some days, and then be discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n125: THE CHANGING OF TEACHERS SHOULD BE NEITHER TOO ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changing of teachers should be neither too frequent nor too much\r\ndelayed; moderation is preferable. Holding your meetings when it is the\r\ntime of prayer in other churches is not advisable; it would lead to\r\nalienation, since the Baha'i children who have their own Sunday school\r\nwould be deprived of it if they tried to attend other Sunday schools.\r\nMoreover, the admission of children of non-Baha'i parents to the school\r\nfor Baha'i children is permissible. And if, in this school, an outline of\r\nthe fundamental principles underlying all religions be set forth for the\r\ninformation of the children, it can do no harm.\r\n\r\nAs the children are few in number, it is not possible to have different\r\nclasses and naturally only one is necessary. Concerning the last question\r\nregarding differences among children, act as ye deem advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n126: THY LETTER WAS RECEIVED. PRAISE BE TO GOD IT ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThy letter was received. Praise be to God it imparted the good news of thy\r\nhealth and safety and indicated that thou art ready to enter an\r\nagricultural school. This is highly suitable. Strive as much as possible\r\nto become proficient in the science of agriculture, for in accordance with\r\nthe divine teachings the acquisition of sciences and the perfection of\r\narts are considered acts of worship. If a man engageth with all his power\r\nin the acquisition of a science or in the perfection of an art, it is as\r\nif he has been worshipping God in churches and temples. Thus as thou\r\nenterest a school of agriculture and strivest in the acquisition of that\r\nscience thou art day and night engaged in acts of worship--acts that are\r\naccepted at the threshold of the Almighty. What bounty greater than this\r\nthat science should be considered as an act of worship and art as service\r\nto the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n127: O THOU SERVANT OF THE ONE TRUE GOD! IN THIS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou servant of the One true God! In this universal dispensation man's\r\nwondrous craftsmanship is reckoned as worship of the Resplendent Beauty.\r\nConsider what a bounty and blessing it is that craftsmanship is regarded\r\nas worship. In former times, it was believed that such skills were\r\ntantamount to ignorance, if not a misfortune, hindering man from drawing\r\nnigh unto God. Now consider how His infinite bestowals and abundant\r\nfavours have changed hell-fire into blissful paradise, and a heap of dark\r\ndust into a luminous garden.\r\n\r\nIt behoveth the craftsmen of the world at each moment to offer a thousand\r\ntokens of gratitude at the Sacred Threshold, and to exert their highest\r\nendeavour and diligently pursue their professions so that their efforts\r\nmay produce that which will manifest the greatest beauty and perfection\r\nbefore the eyes of all men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n128: THY LETTER WAS RECEIVED. I HOPE THAT THOU MAYEST ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThy letter was received. I hope that thou mayest be protected and assisted\r\nunder the providence of the True One, be occupied always in mentioning the\r\nLord and display effort to complete thy profession. Thou must endeavour\r\ngreatly so that thou mayest become unique in thy profession and famous in\r\nthose parts, because attaining perfection in one's profession in this\r\nmerciful period is considered to be worship of God. And whilst thou art\r\noccupied with thy profession, thou canst remember the True One.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n129: O FRIENDS OF THE PURE AND OMNIPOTENT GOD! TO ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO Friends of the Pure and Omnipotent God! To be pure and holy in all\r\nthings is an attribute of the consecrated soul and a necessary\r\ncharacteristic of the unenslaved mind. The best of perfections is\r\nimmaculacy and the freeing of oneself from every defect. Once the\r\nindividual is, in every respect, cleansed and purified, then will he\r\nbecome a focal centre reflecting the Manifest Light.\r\n\r\nFirst in a human being's way of life must be purity, then freshness,\r\ncleanliness, and independence of spirit. First must the stream bed be\r\ncleansed, then may the sweet river waters be led into it. Chaste eyes\r\nenjoy the beatific vision of the Lord and know what this encounter\r\nmeaneth; a pure sense inhaleth the fragrances that blow from the rose\r\ngardens of His grace; a burnished heart will mirror forth the comely face\r\nof truth.\r\n\r\nThis is why, in Holy Scriptures, the counsels of heaven are likened to\r\nwater, even as the Qur'an saith: 'And pure water send We down from\r\nHeaven,'(42) and the Gospel: 'Except a man be baptized of water and of the\r\nspirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.'(43) Thus is it clear\r\nthat the Teachings which come from God are heavenly outpourings of grace;\r\nthey are rain-showers of divine mercy, and they cleanse the human heart.\r\n\r\nMy meaning is this, that in every aspect of life, purity and holiness,\r\ncleanliness and refinement, exalt the human condition and further the\r\ndevelopment of man's inner reality. Even in the physical realm,\r\ncleanliness will conduce to spirituality, as the Holy Writings clearly\r\nstate. And although bodily cleanliness is a physical thing, it hath,\r\nnevertheless, a powerful influence on the life of the spirit. It is even\r\nas a voice wondrously sweet, or a melody played: although sounds are but\r\nvibrations in the air which affect the ear's auditory nerve, and these\r\nvibrations are but chance phenomena carried along through the air, even\r\nso, see how they move the heart. A wondrous melody is wings for the\r\nspirit, and maketh the soul to tremble for joy. The purport is that\r\nphysical cleanliness doth also exert its effect upon the human soul.\r\n\r\nObserve how pleasing is cleanliness in the sight of God, and how\r\nspecifically it is emphasized in the Holy Books of the Prophets; for the\r\nScriptures forbid the eating or the use of any unclean thing. Some of\r\nthese prohibitions were absolute, and binding upon all, and whoso\r\ntransgressed the given law was abhorred of God and anathematized by the\r\nbelievers. Such, for example, were things categorically forbidden, the\r\nperpetration of which was accounted a most grievous sin, among them\r\nactions so loathsome that it is shameful even to speak their name.\r\n\r\nBut there are other forbidden things which do not cause immediate harm,\r\nand the injurious effects of which are only gradually produced: such acts\r\nare also repugnant to the Lord, and blameworthy in His sight, and\r\nrepellent. The absolute unlawfulness of these, however, hath not been\r\nexpressly set forth in the Text, but their avoidance is necessary to\r\npurity, cleanliness, the preservation of health, and freedom from\r\naddiction.\r\n\r\nAmong these latter is smoking tobacco, which is dirty, smelly,\r\noffensive--an evil habit, and one the harmfulness of which gradually\r\nbecometh apparent to all. Every qualified physician hath ruled--and this\r\nhath also been proven by tests--that one of the components of tobacco is a\r\ndeadly poison, and that the smoker is vulnerable to many and various\r\ndiseases. This is why smoking hath been plainly set forth as repugnant\r\nfrom the standpoint of hygiene.\r\n\r\nThe Bab, at the outset of His mission, explicitly prohibited tobacco, and\r\nthe friends one and all abandoned its use. But since those were times when\r\ndissimulation was permitted, and every individual who abstained from\r\nsmoking was exposed to harassment, abuse and even death--the friends, in\r\norder not to advertise their beliefs, would smoke. Later on, the Book of\r\nAqdas was revealed, and since smoking tobacco was not specifically\r\nforbidden there, the believers did not give it up. The Blessed Beauty,\r\nhowever, always expressed repugnance for it, and although, in the early\r\ndays, there were reasons why He would smoke a little tobacco, in time He\r\ncompletely renounced it, and those sanctified souls who followed Him in\r\nall things also abandoned its use.\r\n\r\nMy meaning is that in the sight of God, smoking tobacco is deprecated,\r\nabhorrent, filthy in the extreme; and, albeit by degrees, highly injurious\r\nto health. It is also a waste of money and time, and maketh the user a\r\nprey to a noxious addiction. To those who stand firm in the Covenant, this\r\nhabit is therefore censured both by reason and experience, and renouncing\r\nit will bring relief and peace of mind to all men. Furthermore, this will\r\nmake it possible to have a fresh mouth and unstained fingers, and hair\r\nthat is free of a foul and repellent smell. On receipt of this missive,\r\nthe friends will surely, by whatever means and even over a period of time,\r\nforsake this pernicious habit. Such is my hope.\r\n\r\nAs to opium, it is foul and accursed. God protect us from the punishment\r\nHe inflicteth on the user. According to the explicit Text of the Most Holy\r\nBook, it is forbidden, and its use is utterly condemned. Reason showeth\r\nthat smoking opium is a kind of insanity, and experience attesteth that\r\nthe user is completely cut off from the human kingdom. May God protect all\r\nagainst the perpetration of an act so hideous as this, an act which layeth\r\nin ruins the very foundation of what it is to be human, and which causeth\r\nthe user to be dispossessed for ever and ever. For opium fasteneth on the\r\nsoul, so that the user's conscience dieth, his mind is blotted away, his\r\nperceptions are eroded. It turneth the living into the dead. It quencheth\r\nthe natural heat. No greater harm can be conceived than that which opium\r\ninflicteth. Fortunate are they who never even speak the name of it; then\r\nthink how wretched is the user.\r\n\r\nO ye lovers of God! In this, the cycle of Almighty God, violence and\r\nforce, constraint and oppression, are one and all condemned. It is,\r\nhowever, mandatory that the use of opium be prevented by any means\r\nwhatsoever, that perchance the human race may be delivered from this most\r\npowerful of plagues. And otherwise, woe and misery to whoso falleth short\r\nof his duty to his Lord.(44)\r\n\r\nO Divine Providence! Bestow Thou in all things purity and cleanliness upon\r\nthe people of Baha. Grant that they be freed from all defilement, and\r\nreleased from all addictions. Save them from committing any repugnant act,\r\nunbind them from the chains of every evil habit, that they may live pure\r\nand free, wholesome and cleanly, worthy to serve at Thy Sacred Threshold\r\nand fit to be related to their Lord. Deliver them from intoxicating drinks\r\nand tobacco, save them, rescue them, from this opium that bringeth on\r\nmadness, suffer them to enjoy the sweet savours of holiness, that they may\r\ndrink deep of the mystic cup of heavenly love and know the rapture of\r\nbeing drawn ever closer unto the Realm of the All-Glorious. For it is even\r\nas Thou hast said: 'All that thou hast in thy cellar will not appease the\r\nthirst of my love--bring me, O cup-bearer, of the wine of the spirit a cup\r\nfull as the sea!'\r\n\r\nO ye, God's loved ones! Experience hath shown how greatly the renouncing\r\nof smoking, of intoxicating drink, and of opium, conduceth to health and\r\nvigour, to the expansion and keenness of the mind and to bodily strength.\r\nThere is today a people(45) who strictly avoid tobacco, intoxicating\r\nliquor and opium. This people is far and away superior to the others, for\r\nstrength and physical courage, for health, beauty and comeliness. A single\r\none of their men can stand up to ten men of another tribe. This hath\r\nproved true of the entire people: that is, member for member, each\r\nindividual of this community is in every respect superior to the\r\nindividuals of other communities.\r\n\r\nMake ye then a mighty effort, that the purity and sanctity which, above\r\nall else, are cherished by 'Abdu'l-Baha, shall distinguish the people of\r\nBaha; that in every kind of excellence the people of God shall surpass all\r\nother human beings; that both outwardly and inwardly they shall prove\r\nsuperior to the rest; that for purity, immaculacy, refinement, and the\r\npreservation of health, they shall be leaders in the vanguard of those who\r\nknow. And that by their freedom from enslavement, their knowledge, their\r\nself-control, they shall be first among the pure, the free and the wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n130: O THOU DISTINGUISHED PHYSICIAN!... PRAISE BE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou distinguished physician!... Praise be to God that thou hast two\r\npowers: one to undertake physical healing and the other spiritual healing.\r\nMatters related to man's spirit have a great effect on his bodily\r\ncondition. For instance, thou shouldst impart gladness to thy patient,\r\ngive him comfort and joy, and bring him to ecstasy and exultation. How\r\noften hath it occurred that this hath caused early recovery. Therefore,\r\ntreat thou the sick with both powers. Spiritual feelings have a surprising\r\neffect on healing nervous ailments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n131: WHEN GIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT TURN TO THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen giving medical treatment turn to the Blessed Beauty, then follow the\r\ndictates of thy heart. Remedy the sick by means of heavenly joy and\r\nspiritual exultation, cure the sorely afflicted by imparting to them\r\nblissful glad tidings and heal the wounded through His resplendent\r\nbestowals. When at the bedside of a patient, cheer and gladden his heart\r\nand enrapture his spirit through celestial power. Indeed, such a heavenly\r\nbreath quickeneth every mouldering bone and reviveth the spirit of every\r\nsick and ailing one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n132: ALTHOUGH ILL HEALTH IS ONE OF THE UNAVOIDABLE CONDITIONS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough ill health is one of the unavoidable conditions of man, truly it\r\nis hard to bear. The bounty of good health is the greatest of all gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n133: THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF HEALING SICKNESS, MATERIAL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of healing sickness, material means and spiritual\r\nmeans. The first is by the treatment of physicians; the second consisteth\r\nin prayers offered by the spiritual ones to God and in turning to Him.\r\nBoth means should be used and practised.\r\n\r\nIllnesses which occur by reason of physical causes should be treated by\r\ndoctors with medical remedies; those which are due to spiritual causes\r\ndisappear through spiritual means. Thus an illness caused by affliction,\r\nfear, nervous impressions, will be healed more effectively by spiritual\r\nrather than by physical treatment. Hence, both kinds of treatment should\r\nbe followed; they are not contradictory. Therefore thou shouldst also\r\naccept physical remedies inasmuch as these too have come from the mercy\r\nand favour of God, Who hath revealed and made manifest medical science so\r\nthat His servants may profit from this kind of treatment also. Thou\r\nshouldst give equal attention to spiritual treatments, for they produce\r\nmarvellous effects.\r\n\r\nNow, if thou wishest to know the true remedy which will heal man from all\r\nsickness and will give him the health of the divine kingdom, know that it\r\nis the precepts and teachings of God. Focus thine attention upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n134: O THOU WHO ART ATTRACTED TO THE FRAGRANT BREATHINGS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art attracted to the fragrant breathings of God! I have read\r\nthy letter addressed to Mrs. Lua Getsinger. Thou hast indeed examined with\r\ngreat care the reasons for the incursion of disease into the human body.\r\nIt is certainly the case that sins are a potent cause of physical\r\nailments. If humankind were free from the defilements of sin and\r\nwaywardness, and lived according to a natural, inborn equilibrium, without\r\nfollowing wherever their passions led, it is undeniable that diseases\r\nwould no longer take the ascendant, nor diversify with such intensity.\r\n\r\nBut man hath perversely continued to serve his lustful appetites, and he\r\nwould not content himself with simple foods. Rather, he prepared for\r\nhimself food that was compounded of many ingredients, of substances\r\ndiffering one from the other. With this, and with the perpetrating of vile\r\nand ignoble acts, his attention was engrossed, and he abandoned the\r\ntemperance and moderation of a natural way of life. The result was the\r\nengendering of diseases both violent and diverse.\r\n\r\nFor the animal, as to its body, is made up of the same constituent\r\nelements as man. Since, however, the animal contenteth itself with simple\r\nfoods and striveth not to indulge its importunate urges to any great\r\ndegree, and committeth no sins, its ailments relative to man's are few. We\r\nsee clearly, therefore, how powerful are sin and contumacy as pathogenic\r\nfactors. And once engendered these diseases become compounded, multiply,\r\nand are transmitted to others. Such are the spiritual, inner causes of\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nThe outer, physical causal factor in disease, however, is a disturbance in\r\nthe balance, the proportionate equilibrium of all those elements of which\r\nthe human body is composed. To illustrate: the body of man is a compound\r\nof many constituent substances, each component being present in a\r\nprescribed amount, contributing to the essential equilibrium of the whole.\r\nSo long as these constituents remain in their due proportion, according to\r\nthe natural balance of the whole--that is, no component suffereth a change\r\nin its natural proportionate degree and balance, no component being either\r\naugmented or decreased--there will be no physical cause for the incursion\r\nof disease.\r\n\r\nFor example, the starch component must be present to a given amount, and\r\nthe sugar to a given amount. So long as each remaineth in its natural\r\nproportion to the whole, there will be no cause for the onset of disease.\r\nWhen, however, these constituents vary as to their natural and due\r\namounts--that is, when they are augmented or diminished--it is certain that\r\nthis will provide for the inroads of disease.\r\n\r\nThis question requireth the most careful investigation. The Bab hath said\r\nthat the people of Baha must develop the science of medicine to such a\r\nhigh degree that they will heal illnesses by means of foods. The basic\r\nreason for this is that if, in some component substance of the human body,\r\nan imbalance should occur, altering its correct, relative proportion to\r\nthe whole, this fact will inevitably result in the onset of disease. If,\r\nfor example, the starch component should be unduly augmented, or the sugar\r\ncomponent decreased, an illness will take control. It is the function of a\r\nskilled physician to determine which constituent of his patient's body\r\nhath suffered diminution, which hath been augmented. Once he hath\r\ndiscovered this, he must prescribe a food containing the diminished\r\nelement in considerable amounts, to re-establish the body's essential\r\nequilibrium. The patient, once his constitution is again in balance, will\r\nbe rid of his disease.\r\n\r\nThe proof of this is that while other animals have never studied medical\r\nscience, nor carried on researches into diseases or medicines, treatments\r\nor cures--even so, when one of them falleth a prey to sickness, nature\r\nleadeth it, in fields or desert places, to the very plant which, once\r\neaten, will rid the animal of its disease. The explanation is that if, as\r\nan example, the sugar component in the animal's body hath decreased,\r\naccording to a natural law the animal hankereth after a herb that is rich\r\nin sugar. Then, by a natural urge, which is the appetite, among a thousand\r\ndifferent varieties of plants across the field, the animal will discover\r\nand consume that herb which containeth a sugar component in large amounts.\r\nThus the essential balance of the substances composing its body is\r\nre-established, and the animal is rid of its disease.\r\n\r\nThis question requireth the most careful investigation. When\r\nhighly-skilled physicians shall fully examine this matter, thoroughly and\r\nperseveringly, it will be clearly seen that the incursion of disease is\r\ndue to a disturbance in the relative amounts of the body's component\r\nsubstances, and that treatment consisteth in adjusting these relative\r\namounts, and that this can be apprehended and made possible by means of\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that in this wonderful new age the development of medical\r\nscience will lead to the doctors' healing their patients with foods. For\r\nthe sense of sight, the sense of hearing, of taste, of smell, of touch--all\r\nthese are discriminative faculties, their purpose being to separate the\r\nbeneficial from whatever causeth harm. Now, is it possible that man's\r\nsense of smell, the sense that differentiates odours, should find some\r\nodour repugnant, and that odour be beneficial to the human body? Absurd!\r\nImpossible! In the same way, could the human body, through the faculty of\r\nsight--the differentiator among things visible--benefit from gazing upon a\r\nrevolting mass of excrement? Never! Again, if the sense of taste, likewise\r\na faculty that selecteth and rejecteth, be offended by something, that\r\nthing is certainly not beneficial; and if, at the outset, it may yield\r\nsome advantage, in the long run its harmfulness will be established.\r\n\r\nAnd likewise, when the constitution is in a state of equilibrium, there is\r\nno doubt that whatever is relished will be beneficial to health. Observe\r\nhow an animal will graze in a field where there are a hundred thousand\r\nkinds of herbs and grasses, and how, with its sense of smell, it snuffeth\r\nup the odours of the plants, and tasteth them with its sense of taste;\r\nthen it consumeth whatever herb is pleasurable to these senses, and\r\nbenefiteth therefrom. Were it not for this power of selectivity, the\r\nanimals would all be dead in a single day; for there are a great many\r\npoisonous plants, and animals know nothing of the pharmacopoeia. And yet,\r\nobserve what a reliable set of scales they have, by means of which to\r\ndifferentiate the good from the injurious. Whatever constituent of their\r\nbody hath decreased, they can rehabilitate by seeking out and consuming\r\nsome plant that hath an abundant store of that diminished element; and\r\nthus the equilibrium of their bodily components is re-established, and\r\nthey are rid of their disease.\r\n\r\nAt whatever time highly-skilled physicians shall have developed the\r\nhealing of illnesses by means of foods, and shall make provision for\r\nsimple foods, and shall prohibit humankind from living as slaves to their\r\nlustful appetites, it is certain that the incidence of chronic and\r\ndiversified illnesses will abate, and the general health of all mankind\r\nwill be much improved. This is destined to come about. In the same way, in\r\nthe character, the conduct and the manners of men, universal modifications\r\nwill be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n135: ACCORDING TO THE EXPLICIT DECREE OF BAHA'U'LLAH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the explicit decree of Baha'u'llah one must not turn aside\r\nfrom the advice of a competent doctor. It is imperative to consult one\r\neven if the patient himself be a well-known and eminent physician. In\r\nshort, the point is that you should maintain your health by consulting a\r\nhighly-skilled physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n136: IT IS INCUMBENT UPON EVERYONE TO SEEK MEDICAL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent upon everyone to seek medical treatment and to follow the\r\ndoctor's instructions, for this is in compliance with the divine\r\nordinance, but, in reality, He Who giveth healing is God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n137: O THOU WHO ART VOICING THE PRAISES OF THY LORD! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art voicing the praises of thy Lord! I have read thy letter,\r\nwherein thou didst express astonishment at some of the laws of God, such\r\nas that concerning the hunting of innocent animals, creatures who are\r\nguilty of no wrong.\r\n\r\nBe thou not surprised at this. Reflect upon the inner realities of the\r\nuniverse, the secret wisdoms involved, the enigmas, the\r\ninter-relationships, the rules that govern all. For every part of the\r\nuniverse is connected with every other part by ties that are very powerful\r\nand admit of no imbalance, nor any slackening whatever. In the physical\r\nrealm of creation, all things are eaters and eaten: the plant drinketh in\r\nthe mineral, the animal doth crop and swallow down the plant, man doth\r\nfeed upon the animal, and the mineral devoureth the body of man. Physical\r\nbodies are transferred past one barrier after another, from one life to\r\nanother, and all things are subject to transformation and change, save\r\nonly the essence of existence itself--since it is constant and immutable,\r\nand upon it is founded the life of every species and kind, of every\r\ncontingent reality throughout the whole of creation.\r\n\r\nWhensoever thou dost examine, through a microscope, the water man\r\ndrinketh, the air he doth breathe, thou wilt see that with every breath of\r\nair, man taketh in an abundance of animal life, and with every draught of\r\nwater, he also swalloweth down a great variety of animals. How could it\r\never be possible to put a stop to this process? For all creatures are\r\neaters and eaten, and the very fabric of life is reared upon this fact.\r\nWere it not so, the ties that interlace all created things within the\r\nuniverse would be unravelled.\r\n\r\nAnd further, whensoever a thing is destroyed, and decayeth, and is cut off\r\nfrom life, it is promoted into a world that is greater than the world it\r\nknew before. It leaveth, for example, the life of the mineral and goeth\r\nforward into the life of the plant; then it departeth out of the vegetable\r\nlife and ascendeth into that of the animal, following which it forsaketh\r\nthe life of the animal and riseth into the realm of human life, and this\r\nis out of the grace of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\r\n\r\nI beg of God that He will assist thee to comprehend the mysteries that lie\r\nat the heart of creation, and will draw away the veil from before thine\r\neyes and thy sister's, that the well-guarded secret may be disclosed unto\r\nthee, and the hidden mystery be revealed as clear as the sun at noonday;\r\nthat He will aid thy sister and thy husband to enter the Kingdom of God,\r\nand will heal thee of every ill, whether physical or spiritual, that\r\nassaileth one in this life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n138: O YE BELOVED OF THE LORD! THE KINGDOM OF GOD ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! The Kingdom of God is founded upon equity and\r\njustice, and also upon mercy, compassion, and kindness to every living\r\nsoul. Strive ye then with all your heart to treat compassionately all\r\nhumankind--except for those who have some selfish, private motive, or some\r\ndisease of the soul. Kindness cannot be shown the tyrant, the deceiver, or\r\nthe thief, because, far from awakening them to the error of their ways, it\r\nmaketh them to continue in their perversity as before. No matter how much\r\nkindliness ye may expend upon the liar, he will but lie the more, for he\r\nbelieveth you to be deceived, while ye understand him but too well, and\r\nonly remain silent out of your extreme compassion.\r\n\r\nBriefly, it is not only their fellow human beings that the beloved of God\r\nmust treat with mercy and compassion, rather must they show forth the\r\nutmost loving-kindness to every living creature. For in all physical\r\nrespects, and where the animal spirit is concerned, the selfsame feelings\r\nare shared by animal and man. Man hath not grasped this truth, however,\r\nand he believeth that physical sensations are confined to human beings,\r\nwherefore is he unjust to the animals, and cruel.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in truth, what difference is there when it cometh to physical\r\nsensations? The feelings are one and the same, whether ye inflict pain on\r\nman or on beast. There is no difference here whatever. And indeed ye do\r\nworse to harm an animal, for man hath a language, he can lodge a\r\ncomplaint, he can cry out and moan; if injured he can have recourse to the\r\nauthorities and these will protect him from his aggressor. But the hapless\r\nbeast is mute, able neither to express its hurt nor take its case to the\r\nauthorities. If a man inflict a thousand ills upon a beast, it can neither\r\nward him off with speech nor hale him into court. Therefore is it\r\nessential that ye show forth the utmost consideration to the animal, and\r\nthat ye be even kinder to him than to your fellow man.\r\n\r\nTrain your children from their earliest days to be infinitely tender and\r\nloving to animals. If an animal be sick, let the children try to heal it,\r\nif it be hungry, let them feed it, if thirsty, let them quench its thirst,\r\nif weary, let them see that it rests.\r\n\r\nMost human beings are sinners, but the beasts are innocent. Surely those\r\nwithout sin should receive the most kindness and love--all except animals\r\nwhich are harmful, such as bloodthirsty wolves, such as poisonous snakes,\r\nand similar pernicious creatures, the reason being that kindness to these\r\nis an injustice to human beings and to other animals as well. If, for\r\nexample, ye be tender-hearted toward a wolf, this is but tyranny to a\r\nsheep, for a wolf will destroy a whole flock of sheep. A rabid dog, if\r\ngiven the chance, can kill a thousand animals and men. Therefore,\r\ncompassion shown to wild and ravening beasts is cruelty to the peaceful\r\nones--and so the harmful must be dealt with. But to blessed animals the\r\nutmost kindness must be shown, the more the better. Tenderness and\r\nloving-kindness are basic principles of God's heavenly Kingdom. Ye should\r\nmost carefully bear this matter in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n139: O THOU HANDMAID OF GOD! THE HEAVENLY GLAD ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou handmaid of God! The heavenly glad tidings must be delivered with\r\nthe utmost dignity and magnanimity. And until a soul ariseth with\r\nqualities which are essential for the bearer of these tidings, his words\r\nwill take no effect.\r\n\r\nO bondswoman of God! The human spirit possesseth wondrous powers, but it\r\nshould be reinforced by the Holy Spirit. What thou hearest other than this\r\nis pure imagination. If, however, it be assisted by the bounty of the Holy\r\nSpirit, then will its strength be a thing to marvel at. Then will that\r\nhuman spirit uncover realities, and unravel mysteries. Turn thy heart\r\nfully to the Holy Spirit, and invite others to do the same; then shall ye\r\nwitness wonderful results.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! The stars in the sky do not exert any spiritual\r\ninfluence on this world of dust; but all the members and parts of the\r\nuniverse are very strongly linked together in that limitless space, and\r\nthis connection produceth a reciprocity of material effects. Outside the\r\nbounty of the Holy Spirit, whatsoever thou hearest as to the effect of\r\ntrances, or the mediums' trumpets, conveying the singing voices of the\r\ndead, is imagination pure and simple. As to the bounty of the Holy Spirit,\r\nhowever, relate whatsoever thou wilt--it cannot be overstated; believe,\r\ntherefore, whatsoever thou hearest of this. But the persons referred to,\r\nthe trumpet-people, are entirely shut out from this bounty and receive no\r\nportion thereof; their way is an illusion.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! Prayers are granted through the universal\r\nManifestations of God. Nevertheless, where the wish is to obtain material\r\nthings, even where the heedless are concerned, if they supplicate, humbly\r\nimploring God's help--even their prayer hath an effect.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! Although the reality of Divinity is sanctified and\r\nboundless, the aims and needs of the creatures are restricted. God's grace\r\nis like the rain that cometh down from heaven: the water is not bounded by\r\nthe limitations of form, yet on whatever place it poureth down, it taketh\r\non limitations--dimensions, appearance, shape--according to the\r\ncharacteristics of that place. In a square pool, the water, previously\r\nunconfined, becometh a square; in a six-sided pool it becometh a hexagon,\r\nin an eight-sided pool an octagon, and so forth. The rain itself hath no\r\ngeometry, no limits, no form, but it taketh on one form or another,\r\naccording to the restrictions of its vessel. In the same way, the Holy\r\nEssence of the Lord God is boundless, immeasurable, but His graces and\r\nsplendours become finite in the creatures, because of their limitations,\r\nwherefore the prayers of given persons will receive favourable answers in\r\ncertain cases.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! It is with the Lord Christ even as with Adam. Did the\r\nfirst human being who came into existence on this earth have a father or\r\nmother? It is certain that he had neither. But Christ lacked only a\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! The prayers which were revealed to ask for healing\r\napply both to physical and spiritual healing. Recite them, then, to heal\r\nboth the soul and the body. If healing is right for the patient, it will\r\ncertainly be granted; but for some ailing persons, healing would only be\r\nthe cause of other ills, and therefore wisdom doth not permit an\r\naffirmative answer to the prayer.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! The power of the Holy Spirit healeth both physical and\r\nspiritual ailments.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God! It is recorded in the Torah: And I will give you the\r\nvalley of Achor for a door of hope. This valley of Achor is the city of\r\nAkka, and whoso hath interpreted this otherwise is of those who know not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n140: THOU DIDST ASK AS TO THE TRANSFIGURATION OF JESUS, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThou didst ask as to the transfiguration of Jesus, with Moses and Elias\r\nand the Heavenly Father on Mount Tabor, as referred to in the Bible. This\r\noccurrence was perceived by the disciples with their inner eye, wherefore\r\nit was a secret hidden away, and was a spiritual discovery of theirs.\r\nOtherwise, if the intent be that they witnessed physical forms, that is,\r\nwitnessed that transfiguration with their outward eyes, then there were\r\nmany others at hand on that plain and mountain, and why did they fail to\r\nbehold it? And why did the Lord charge them that they should tell no man?\r\nIt is clear that this was a spiritual vision and a scene of the Kingdom.\r\nWherefore did the Messiah bid them to keep this hidden, 'till the Son of\r\nMan were risen from the dead,'(46)--that is, until the Cause of God should\r\nbe exalted, and the Word of God prevail, and the reality of Christ rise\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n141: O THOU YEARNING FLAME, THOU WHO ART AFIRE WITH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou yearning flame, thou who art afire with the love of God! I have\r\nread thy letter, and its contents, well-expressed and eloquent, delighted\r\nmy heart, showing as they did thy deep sincerity in the Cause of God, thy\r\npersevering steps along the pathway of His Kingdom, and thy staunchness in\r\nHis Faith--for of all great things, this is the greatest in His sight.\r\n\r\nHow many a soul hath turned itself unto the Lord and entered into the\r\nprotective shadow of His Word, and become famed throughout the world--for\r\nexample, Judas Iscariot. And then, when the tests grew harsh and the\r\nviolence thereof intensified, their feet slipped on the pathway and they\r\nturned backward from the Faith after having acknowledged its truth, and\r\nthey denied it, and fell away from harmony and love into mischief and\r\nhate. Thus became visible the power of tests, which maketh mighty pillars\r\nto tremble and shake.\r\n\r\nJudas Iscariot was the greatest of the disciples, and he summoned the\r\npeople to Christ. Then it seemed to him that Jesus was showing increasing\r\nregard to the Apostle Peter, and when Jesus said, 'Thou art Peter, and\r\nupon this rock I will build My church,' these words addressed to Peter,\r\nand this singling out of Peter for special honour, had a marked effect on\r\nthe Apostle, and kindled envy within the heart of Judas. For this reason\r\nhe who had once drawn nigh did turn aside, and he who had believed in the\r\nFaith denied it, and his love changed to hate, until he became a cause of\r\nthe crucifixion of that glorious Lord, that manifest Splendour. Such is\r\nthe outcome of envy, the chief reason why men turn aside from the Straight\r\nPath. So hath it occurred, and will occur, in this great Cause. But it\r\ndoth not matter, for it engendereth loyalty in the rest, and maketh souls\r\nto arise who waver not, who are fixed and unshakeable as the mountains in\r\ntheir love for the Manifest Light.\r\n\r\nConvey thou unto the handmaids of the Merciful the message that when a\r\ntest turneth violent they must stand unmoved, and faithful to their love\r\nfor Baha. In winter come the storms, and the great winds blow, but then\r\nwill follow spring in all its beauty, adorning hill and plain with\r\nperfumed plants and red anemones, fair to see. Then will the birds trill\r\nout upon the branches their songs of joy, and sermonize in lilting tones\r\nfrom the pulpits of the trees. Erelong shall ye bear witness that the\r\nlights are streaming forth, the banners of the realm above are waving, the\r\nsweet scents of the All-Merciful are wafted abroad, the hosts of the\r\nKingdom are marching down, the angels of heaven are rushing forward, and\r\nthe Holy Spirit is breathing upon all those regions. On that day thou\r\nshalt behold the waverers, men and women alike, frustrated of their hopes\r\nand in manifest loss. This is decreed by the Lord, the Revealer of Verses.\r\n\r\nAs to thee, blessed art thou, for thou art steadfast in the Cause of God,\r\nfirm in His Covenant. I beg of Him to bestow upon thee a spiritual soul,\r\nand the life of the Kingdom, and to make thee a leaf verdant and\r\nflourishing on the Tree of Life, that thou mayest serve the handmaids of\r\nthe Merciful with spirituality and good cheer.\r\n\r\nThy generous Lord will assist thee to labour in His vineyard and will\r\ncause thee to be the means of spreading the spirit of unity among His\r\nhandmaids. He will make thine inner eye to see with the light of\r\nknowledge, He will forgive thy sins and transform them into goodly deeds.\r\nVerily He is the Forgiving, the Compassionate, the Lord of immeasurable\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n142: O THOU DEAR HANDMAID OF GOD! PRAISE THOU GOD, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou dear handmaid of God! Praise thou God, because thou art favoured at\r\nHis Holy Threshold, and cherished in the Kingdom of His might. Thou art\r\nthe head of an assembly which is the very imprint of the Company on high,\r\nthe mirror-image of the all-glorious realm. Strive thou with heart and\r\nsoul, in prayerful humility and self-effacement, to uphold the Law of God\r\nand spread His sweet savours abroad. Endeavour thou to become the true\r\npresident of the assemblies of spiritual souls, and a companion to the\r\nangels in the realm of the All-Merciful.\r\n\r\nThou didst ask as to the tenth to the seventeenth verses of the\r\ntwenty-first chapter of Saint John the Divine's Revelation. Know thou that\r\naccording to mathematical principles, the firmament of this earth's\r\nbrilliant day-star hath been divided among twelve constellations, which\r\nthey call the twelve zodiacal signs. In the same way, the Sun of Truth\r\nshineth out from and sheddeth its bounties through twelve stations of\r\nholiness, and by these heavenly signs are meant those stainless and\r\nunsullied personages who are the very well-springs of sanctity, and the\r\ndawning-points proclaiming the oneness of God.\r\n\r\nConsider how in the days of the Interlocutor (Moses), there were twelve\r\nholy beings who were leaders of the twelve tribes; and likewise in the\r\ndispensation of the Spirit (Christ), note that there were twelve Apostles\r\ngathered within the sheltering shade of that supernal Light, and from\r\nthose splendid dawning-points the Sun of Truth shone forth even as the sun\r\nin the sky. Again, in the days of Muhammad, observe that there were twelve\r\ndawning-points of holiness, the manifestors of God's confirming help. Such\r\nis the way of it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly did Saint John the Divine tell of twelve gates in his vision,\r\nand twelve foundations. By 'that great city, the holy Jerusalem,\r\ndescending out of heaven from God' is meant the holy Law of God, and this\r\nis set forth in many Tablets and still to be read in the Scriptures of the\r\nProphets of the past: for instance, that Jerusalem was seen going out into\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the passage is that this heavenly Jerusalem hath twelve\r\ngates, through which the blessed enter into the City of God. These gates\r\nare souls who are as guiding stars, as portals of knowledge and grace; and\r\nwithin these gates there stand twelve angels. By 'angel' is meant the\r\npower of the confirmations of God--that the candle of God's confirming\r\npower shineth out from the lamp-niche of those souls--meaning that every\r\none of those beings will be granted the most vehement confirming support.\r\n\r\nThese twelve gates surround the entire world, that is they are a shelter\r\nfor all creatures. And further, these twelve gates are the foundation of\r\nthe City of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and on each one of these\r\nfoundations is written the name of one of the Apostles of Christ. That is\r\nto say, each one maketh manifest the perfections, the joyous message, and\r\nthe excellency of that holy Being.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the Scripture saith: 'And he that talked with me had a rod made\r\nout of gold, that is, a measure, wherewith he measured the city and the\r\ngates thereof and the towers thereof.' The meaning is that certain\r\npersonages guided the people with a staff grown out of the earth, and\r\nshepherded them with a rod, like unto the rod of Moses. Others trained and\r\nshepherded the people with a rod of iron, as in the dispensation of\r\nMuhammad. And in this present cycle, because it is the mightiest of\r\nDispensations, that rod grown out of the vegetable kingdom and that rod of\r\niron will be transformed into a rod of purest gold, taken from out the\r\nendless treasure houses in the Kingdom of the Lord. By this rod will the\r\npeople be trained.\r\n\r\nNote well the difference: at one time the Teachings of God were as a\r\nstaff, and by this means the Holy Scriptures were spread abroad, the Law\r\nof God was promulgated and His Faith established. Then followed a time\r\nwhen the staff of the true Shepherd was as iron. And today, in this new\r\nand splendid age, the rod is even as pure gold. How wide is the difference\r\nhere! Know, then, how much ground hath been gained by the Law of God and\r\nHis Teachings in this dispensation, how they have reached such heights\r\nthat they far transcend the dispensations gone before: truly this rod is\r\npurest gold, while those of other days were of iron and wood.\r\n\r\nThis is a brief answer that hath been written for thee, because there was\r\nno time for more. It is certain that thou wilt forgive me. The handmaids\r\nof God must rise to such a station that they will, by themselves and\r\nunaided, comprehend these inner meanings, and be able to expound at full\r\nlength every single word; a station where, out of the truth of their\r\ninmost hearts, a spring of wisdom will well up, and jet forth even as a\r\nfountain that leapeth from its own original source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143: O THOU WHO HAST DRAWN NIGH UNTO THE SPIRIT OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who hast drawn nigh unto the spirit of Christ in the Kingdom of\r\nGod! Verily the body is composed of physical elements, and every composite\r\nmust needs be decomposed. The spirit, however, is a single essence, fine\r\nand delicate, incorporeal, everlasting, and of God. For this reason whoso\r\nlooketh for Christ in His physical body hath looked in vain, and will be\r\nshut away from Him as by a veil. But whoso yearneth to find Him in the\r\nspirit will grow from day to day in joy and desire and burning love, in\r\ncloseness to Him, and in beholding Him clear and plain. In this new and\r\nwondrous day, it behoveth thee to seek after the spirit of Christ.\r\n\r\nVerily the heaven into which the Messiah rose up was not this unending\r\nsky, rather was His heaven the Kingdom of His beneficent Lord. Even as He\r\nHimself hath said, 'I came down from heaven,'(47) and again, 'The Son of\r\nMan is in heaven.'(48) Hence it is clear that His heaven is beyond all\r\ndirectional points; it encircleth all existence, and is raised up for\r\nthose who worship God. Beg and implore thy Lord to lift thee up into that\r\nheaven, and give thee to eat of its food, in this age of majesty and\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nKnow thou that the people, even unto this day, have failed to unravel the\r\nhidden secrets of the Book. They imagine that Christ was excluded from His\r\nheaven in the days when He walked the earth, that He fell from the heights\r\nof His sublimity, and afterwards mounted to those upper reaches of the\r\nsky, to the heaven which doth not exist at all, for it is but space. And\r\nthey are waiting for Him to come down from there again, riding upon a\r\ncloud, and they imagine that there are clouds in that infinite space and\r\nthat He will ride thereon and by that means He will descend. Whereas the\r\ntruth is that a cloud is but vapour that riseth out of the earth, and it\r\ndoth not come down from heaven. Rather, the cloud referred to in the\r\nGospel is the human body, so called because the body is as a veil to man,\r\nwhich, even as a cloud, preventeth him from beholding the Sun of Truth\r\nthat shineth from the horizon of Christ.\r\n\r\nI beg of God to open before thine eyes the gates of discoveries and\r\nperceptions, that thou mayest become informed of His mysteries in this\r\nmost manifest of days.\r\n\r\nI am most eager to meet thee, but the times are not propitious. God\r\nwilling, we shall let thee know of a better time, when thou canst come\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n144: O LOVER OF HUMANKIND! THY LETTER HATH BEEN ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO lover of humankind! Thy letter hath been received, and it telleth, God\r\nbe praised, of thy health and well-being. It appeareth, from thine answer\r\nto a previous letter, that feelings of affection were being established\r\nbetween thyself and the friends.\r\n\r\nOne must see in every human being only that which is worthy of praise.\r\nWhen this is done, one can be a friend to the whole human race. If,\r\nhowever, we look at people from the standpoint of their faults, then being\r\na friend to them is a formidable task.\r\n\r\nIt happened one day in the time of Christ--may the life of the world be a\r\nsacrifice unto Him--that He passed by the dead body of a dog, a carcass\r\nreeking, hideous, the limbs rotting away. One of those present said: 'How\r\nfoul its stench!' And another said: 'How sickening! How loathsome!' To be\r\nbrief, each one of them had something to add to the list.\r\n\r\nBut then Christ Himself spoke, and He told them: 'Look at that dog's\r\nteeth! How gleaming white!'\r\n\r\nThe Messiah's sin-covering gaze did not for a moment dwell upon the\r\nrepulsiveness of that carrion. The one element of that dead dog's carcass\r\nwhich was not abomination was the teeth: and Jesus looked upon their\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\nThus is it incumbent upon us, when we direct our gaze toward other people,\r\nto see where they excel, not where they fail.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, thy goal is to promote the well-being of humankind and\r\nto help the souls to overcome their faults. This good intention will\r\nproduce laudable results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n145: THOU DIDST WRITE AS TO THE QUESTION OF SPIRITUAL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThou didst write as to the question of spiritual discoveries. The spirit\r\nof man is a circumambient power that encompasseth the realities of all\r\nthings. Whatsoever thou dost see about thee--wondrous products of human\r\nworkmanship, inventions, discoveries and like evidences--each one of these\r\nwas once a secret hidden away in the realm of the unknown. The human\r\nspirit laid that secret bare, and drew it forth from the unseen into the\r\nvisible world. There is, for example, the power of steam, and photography\r\nand the phonograph, and wireless telegraphy, and advances in mathematics:\r\neach and every one of these was once a mystery, a closely guarded secret,\r\nyet the human spirit unravelled these secrets and brought them out of the\r\ninvisible into the light of day. Thus is it clear that the human spirit is\r\nan all-encompassing power that exerteth its dominion over the inner\r\nessences of all created things, uncovering the well kept mysteries of the\r\nphenomenal world.\r\n\r\nThe divine spirit, however, doth unveil divine realities and universal\r\nmysteries that lie within the spiritual world. It is my hope that thou\r\nwilt attain unto this divine spirit, so that thou mayest uncover the\r\nsecrets of the other world, as well as the mysteries of the world below.\r\n\r\nThou didst ask as to chapter 14, verse 30 of the Gospel of John, where the\r\nLord Christ saith, 'Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the\r\nPrince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.' The Prince of this\r\nworld is the Blessed Beauty; and 'hath nothing in Me' signifieth: after Me\r\nall will draw grace from Me, but He is independent of Me, and will draw no\r\ngrace from Me. That is, He is rich beyond any grace of Mine.\r\n\r\nAs to thy question regarding discoveries made by the soul after it hath\r\nput off its human form: certainly, that world is a world of perceptions\r\nand discoveries, for the interposed veil will be lifted away and the human\r\nspirit will gaze upon souls that are above, below, and on a par with\r\nitself. It is similar to the condition of a human being in the womb, where\r\nhis eyes are veiled, and all things are hidden away from him. Once he is\r\nborn out of the uterine world and entereth this life, he findeth it, with\r\nrelation to that of the womb, to be a place of perceptions and\r\ndiscoveries, and he observeth all things through his outer eye. In the\r\nsame way, once he hath departed this life, he will behold, in that world\r\nwhatsoever was hidden from him here: but there he will look upon and\r\ncomprehend all things with his inner eye. There will he gaze on his\r\nfellows and his peers, and those in the ranks above him, and those below.\r\nAs for what is meant by the equality of souls in the all-highest realm, it\r\nis this: the souls of the believers, at the time when they first become\r\nmanifest in the world of the body, are equal, and each is sanctified and\r\npure. In this world, however, they will begin to differ one from another,\r\nsome achieving the highest station, some a middle one, others remaining at\r\nthe lowest stage of being. Their equal status is at the beginning of their\r\nexistence; the differentiation followeth their passing away.\r\n\r\nThou didst write as to Seir. Seir is a locality near Nazareth in Galilee.\r\n\r\nAs to the statement of Job, chapter 19, verses 25-27, 'I know that my\r\nRedeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the\r\nearth,' the meaning here is: I shall not be abased, I have a Sustainer and\r\na Guardian, and my Helper, my Defender will in the end be made manifest.\r\nAnd although now my flesh be weak and clothed with worms, yet shall I be\r\nhealed, and with these mine own eyes, that is, mine inner sight, I shall\r\nbehold Him. This did Job say after they had reproached him, and he himself\r\nhad lamented the harms that his tribulations had wreaked upon him. And\r\neven when, from the terrible inroads of the sickness, his body was covered\r\nwith worms, he sought to tell those about him that still he would be fully\r\nhealed, and that in his very body, with his very eyes, he would gaze on\r\nhis Redeemer.\r\n\r\nAs to the woman in the Revelation of Saint John, chapter 12, who fled into\r\nthe wilderness, and the great wonder appearing in the heavens--that woman\r\nclothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet: what is meant by the\r\nwoman is the Law of God. For according to the terminology of the Holy\r\nBooks, this reference is to the Law, the woman being its symbol here. And\r\nthe two luminaries, the sun and the moon, are the two thrones, the Turkish\r\nand the Persian, these two being under the rule of the Law of God. The sun\r\nis the symbol of the Persian Empire, and the moon, that is, the crescent,\r\nof the Turkish. The twelve-fold crown is the twelve Imams, who, even as\r\nthe Apostles, supported the Faith of God. The newborn Child is the Beauty\r\nof the Adored One,(49) come forth out of the Law of God. He then saith\r\nthat the woman fled into the wilderness, that is, the Law of God was\r\ncarried out of Palestine to the desert of Hijaz, where it remained 1260\r\nyears--that is, until the advent of the promised Child. And as is well\r\nknown, in the Holy Books, every day is accounted as one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n146: O THOU HANDMAID AFIRE WITH THE LOVE OF GOD! I ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou handmaid afire with the love of God! I have considered thine\r\nexcellent letter, and thanked God for thy safe arrival in that great city.\r\nI beg of Him, through His unfailing aid, to cause this return of thine to\r\nexert a powerful effect. Such a thing can only come about if thou dost\r\ndivest thyself of all attachment to this world, and dost put on the\r\nvesture of holiness; if thou dost limit all thy thoughts and all thy words\r\nto the remembrance of God and His praise; to spreading His sweet savours\r\nabroad, and performing righteous acts; and if thou dost devote thyself to\r\nawakening the heedless and restoring sight to the blind, hearing to the\r\ndeaf, speech to the mute, and through the power of the spirit, giving life\r\nto the dead.\r\n\r\nFor even as Christ said of them in the Gospel, the people are blind, they\r\nare deaf, they are dumb; and He said: 'I will heal them.'\r\n\r\nBe thou kind and compassionate to thine enfeebled mother, and speak to her\r\nof the Kingdom, that her heart may rejoice.\r\n\r\nGive thou my greetings to Miss Ford. Convey to her the glad tidings that\r\nthese are the days of the Kingdom of God. Say unto her: Blessed art thou\r\nfor thy noble aims, blessed art thou for thy goodly deeds, blessed art\r\nthou for thy spiritual nature. Verily do I love thee on account of these\r\nthine aims and qualities and deeds. Tell her further: Remember the\r\nMessiah, and His days on earth, and His abasement, and His tribulations,\r\nand how the people paid Him no mind. Remember how the Jews would hold Him\r\nup to ridicule, and mock at Him, and address Him with: 'Peace be upon\r\nthee, King of the Jews! Peace be upon thee, King of Kings!' How they would\r\nsay that He was mad, and would ask how the Cause of that crucified One\r\ncould ever spread out to the easts of the world and the wests thereof.\r\nNone followed Him then, save only a few souls who were fishermen,\r\ncarpenters, and other plain folk. Alas, alas, for such delusions!\r\n\r\nAnd see what happened then: how their mighty banners were reversed, and in\r\ntheir place His most exalted standard lifted up; how all the bright stars\r\nin that heaven of honour and pride did set; how they sank in the west of\r\nall that vanisheth--while His brilliant Orb still shineth down out of skies\r\nof undying glory, as the centuries and the ages roll by. Be ye then\r\nadmonished, ye that have eyes to see! Erelong shall ye behold even greater\r\nthings than this.\r\n\r\nKnow thou that all the powers combined have not the power to establish\r\nuniversal peace, nor to withstand the overmastering dominion, at every\r\ntime and season, of these endless wars. Erelong, however, shall the power\r\nof heaven, the dominion of the Holy Spirit, hoist on the high summits the\r\nbanners of love and peace, and there above the castles of majesty and\r\nmight shall those banners wave in the rushing winds that blow out of the\r\ntender mercy of God.\r\n\r\nConvey thou my greetings to Mrs. Florence, and tell her: The diverse\r\ncongregations have given up the ground of their belief, and adopted\r\ndoctrines that are of no account in the sight of God. They are even as the\r\nPharisees who both prayed and fasted, and then did sentence Jesus Christ\r\nto death. By the life of God! This thing is passing strange!\r\n\r\nAs to thee, O handmaid of God, softly recite thou this commune to thy\r\nLord, and say unto Him:\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Fill up for me the cup of detachment from all things, and\r\nin the assembly of Thy splendours and bestowals, rejoice me with the wine\r\nof loving Thee. Free me from the assaults of passion and desire, break off\r\nfrom me the shackles of this nether world, draw me with rapture unto Thy\r\nsupernal realm, and refresh me amongst the handmaids with the breathings\r\nof Thy holiness.\r\n\r\nO Lord, brighten Thou my face with the lights of Thy bestowals, light Thou\r\nmine eyes with beholding the signs of Thine all-subduing might; delight my\r\nheart with the glory of Thy knowledge that encompasseth all things,\r\ngladden Thou my soul with Thy soul-reviving tidings of great joy, O Thou\r\nKing of this world and the Kingdom above, O Thou Lord of dominion and\r\nmight, that I may spread abroad Thy signs and tokens, and proclaim Thy\r\nCause, and promote Thy Teachings, and serve Thy Law, and exalt Thy Word.\r\n\r\nThou art verily the Powerful, the Ever-Giving, the Able, the Omnipotent.\r\n\r\nAs to the fundamentals of teaching the Faith: know thou that delivering\r\nthe Message can be accomplished only through goodly deeds and spiritual\r\nattributes, an utterance that is crystal clear and the happiness reflected\r\nfrom the face of that one who is expounding the Teachings. It is essential\r\nthat the deeds of the teacher should attest the truth of his words. Such\r\nis the state of whoso doth spread abroad the sweet savours of God and the\r\nquality of him who is sincere in his faith.\r\n\r\nOnce the Lord hath enabled thee to attain this condition, be thou assured\r\nthat He will inspire thee with words of truth, and will cause thee to\r\nspeak through the breathings of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: REFLECT UPON THE PAST EVENTS OF THE TIME OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nReflect upon the past events of the time of Christ, and the present events\r\nshall become clear and manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n148: O YE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE KINGDOM! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom! Thankful, the birds of the spirit\r\nseek only to fly in the high heavens and to sing out their songs with\r\nwondrous art. But the pitiable earthworms love only to tunnel into the\r\nground, and what a mighty struggle they make to get themselves down into\r\nits depths! Even so are the sons of earth. Their highest aim is to augment\r\ntheir means of continuing on, in this vanishing world, this death in life;\r\nand this despite the fact that they are bound hand and foot by a thousand\r\ncares and sorrows, and never safe from danger, not even for the twinkling\r\nof an eye; never at any time secure, even from sudden death. Wherefore,\r\nafter a brief span, are they utterly effaced, and no sign remaineth to\r\ntell of them, and no word of them is ever heard again.\r\n\r\nThen let you engage in the praise of Baha'u'llah, for it is through His\r\ngrace and succour that ye have become sons and daughters of the Kingdom;\r\nit is thanks to Him that ye are now songsters in the meadows of truth, and\r\nhave soared upward to the heights of the glory that abideth forever. Ye\r\nhave found your place in the world that dieth not; the breaths of the Holy\r\nSpirit have blown upon you; ye have taken on another life, ye have gained\r\naccess to the Threshold of God.\r\n\r\nWherefore, with great gladness, establish ye spiritual assemblies, and\r\nengage ye in uttering the praise and glorification of the Lord, and\r\ncalling Him Holy and Most Great. Lift up to the realm of the All-Glorious\r\nyour suppliant cries for help, and voice ye at every moment a myriad\r\nthanks for having won this abounding favour and exceeding grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n149: O THOU WHO HAST EYES TO SEE! THAT WHICH THOU ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who hast eyes to see! That which thou didst witness is the very\r\ntruth, and it pertaineth to the realm of vision.\r\n\r\nThe perfume is intimately commingled and blended with the bud, and once\r\nthe bud hath opened the sweet scent of it is spread abroad. The herb is\r\nnot without its fruit, although it seemeth so, for in this garden of God\r\nevery plant exerteth its own influence and hath its own properties, and\r\nevery plant can even match the laughing, hundred-petalled rose in\r\nrejoicing the sense with its fragrance. Be thou assured of this. Although\r\nthe pages of a book know nothing of the words and the meanings traced upon\r\nthem, even so, because of their connection with these words, friends pass\r\nthem reverently from hand to hand. This connection, furthermore, is purest\r\nbounty.\r\n\r\nWhen the human soul soareth out of this transient heap of dust and riseth\r\ninto the world of God, then veils will fall away, and verities will come\r\nto light, and all things unknown before will be made clear, and hidden\r\ntruths be understood.\r\n\r\nConsider how a being, in the world of the womb, was deaf of ear and blind\r\nof eye, and mute of tongue; how he was bereft of any perceptions at all.\r\nBut once, out of that world of darkness, he passed into this world of\r\nlight, then his eye saw, his ear heard, his tongue spoke. In the same way,\r\nonce he hath hastened away from this mortal place into the Kingdom of God,\r\nthen he will be born in the spirit; then the eye of his perception will\r\nopen, the ear of his soul will hearken, and all the truths of which he was\r\nignorant before will be made plain and clear.\r\n\r\nAn observant traveller passing along a way will certainly recall his\r\ndiscoveries to mind, unless some accident befall him and efface the\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n150: O THOU HANDMAID AFLAME WITH THE FIRE OF GOD'S ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou handmaid aflame with the fire of God's love! Grieve thou not over\r\nthe troubles and hardships of this nether world, nor be thou glad in times\r\nof ease and comfort, for both shall pass away. This present life is even\r\nas a swelling wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows. Could ever a\r\ndistorted image on the desert serve as refreshing waters? No, by the Lord\r\nof Lords! Never can reality and the mere semblance of reality be one, and\r\nwide is the difference between fancy and fact, between truth and the\r\nphantom thereof.\r\n\r\nKnow thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is\r\nonly its shadow stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its\r\nexistence is only a fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected\r\nin water, and seeming as pictures to the eye.\r\n\r\nRely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and call Him continually to mind.\r\nHe verily turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace, and toil into\r\nutter peace. He verily hath dominion over all things.\r\n\r\nIf thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of\r\nwhatsoever cometh to pass. Nay rather, under all conditions thank thou thy\r\nloving Lord, and yield up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He\r\npleaseth. This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n151: O THOU BELIEVER IN THE ONENESS OF GOD! KNOW ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou believer in the oneness of God! Know thou that nothing profiteth a\r\nsoul save the love of the All-Merciful, nothing lighteth up a heart save\r\nthe splendour that shineth from the realm of the Lord.\r\n\r\nForsake thou every other concern, let oblivion overtake the memory of all\r\nelse. Confine thy thoughts to whatever will lift up the human soul to the\r\nParadise of heavenly grace, and make every bird of the Kingdom wing its\r\nway unto the Supreme Horizon, the central point of everlasting honour in\r\nthis contingent world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n152: AS TO THE QUESTION REGARDING THE SOUL OF A MURDERER, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the question regarding the soul of a murderer, and what his\r\npunishment would be, the answer given was that the murderer must expiate\r\nhis crime: that is, if they put the murderer to death, his death is his\r\natonement for his crime, and following the death, God in His justice will\r\nimpose no second penalty upon him, for divine justice would not allow\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n153: O THOU HANDMAID OF GOD! IN THIS DAY, TO THANK ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou handmaid of God! In this day, to thank God for His bounties\r\nconsisteth in possessing a radiant heart, and a soul open to the\r\npromptings of the spirit. This is the essence of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nAs for offering thanks by speaking out or writing, although this is indeed\r\nacceptable, yet when compared with that other thanksgiving, it is only a\r\nsemblance and unreal; for the essential thing is these intimations of the\r\nspirit, these emanations from the deep recess of the heart. It is my hope\r\nthat thou wilt be favoured therewith.\r\n\r\nRegarding one's lack of capacity and one's undeserving on the Day of\r\nResurrection, this does not cause one to be shut out from gifts and\r\nbounties; for this is not the Day of Justice but the Day of Grace, while\r\njustice is allotting to each whatever is his due. Then look thou not at\r\nthe degree of thy capacity, look thou at the boundless favour of\r\nBaha'u'llah; all-encompassing is His bounty, and consummate His grace.\r\n\r\nI ask of God that with His assistance and strong support thou mayest teach\r\nthe inner meanings of the Torah with eloquence, understanding, vigour and\r\nskill. Turn thy face toward the Kingdom of God, ask for the bestowals of\r\nthe Holy Spirit, speak, and the confirmations of the Spirit will come.\r\n\r\nAs for that mighty solar orb which thou didst behold in thy dream, that\r\nwas the Promised One, and its spreading rays were His bounties, and the\r\ntranslucent surface of the mass of water signifieth hearts that are\r\nundefiled and pure, while the surging waves denote the great excitement of\r\nthose hearts and the fact that they were shaken and deeply moved, that is,\r\nthe waves are the stirrings of the spirit and holy intimations of the\r\nsoul. Praise thou God that in the world of the dream thou hast witnessed\r\nsuch disclosures.\r\n\r\nWith reference to what is meant by an individual becoming entirely\r\nforgetful of self: the intent is that he should rise up and sacrifice\r\nhimself in the true sense, that is, he should obliterate the promptings of\r\nthe human condition, and rid himself of such characteristics as are worthy\r\nof blame and constitute the gloomy darkness of this life on earth--not that\r\nhe should allow his physical health to deteriorate and his body to become\r\ninfirm.\r\n\r\nI do earnestly and humbly supplicate at the Holy Threshold that heavenly\r\nblessings and divine forgiveness will encompass thy dear mother, as well\r\nas thy loving sisters and relatives. Especially do I pray on behalf of thy\r\nbetrothed, who hath suddenly hastened away from this world into the next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n154: O THOU SON OF THE KINGDOM! THY MOST AGREEABLE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou son of the Kingdom! Thy most agreeable letters, with their pleasing\r\nstyle, ever gladden our hearts. When the song is of the Kingdom, it\r\nrejoiceth the soul.\r\n\r\nPraise thou God that thou hast travelled to that country(50) for the\r\npurpose of raising up His Word and spreading abroad the holy fragrance of\r\nHis Kingdom, and that thou art serving as a gardener in the gardens of\r\nheaven. Erelong shall thine efforts be crowned with success.\r\n\r\nO thou son of the Kingdom! All things are beneficial if joined with the\r\nlove of God; and without His love all things are harmful, and act as a\r\nveil between man and the Lord of the Kingdom. When His love is there,\r\nevery bitterness turneth sweet, and every bounty rendereth a wholesome\r\npleasure. For example, a melody, sweet to the ear, bringeth the very\r\nspirit of life to a heart in love with God, yet staineth with lust a soul\r\nengrossed in sensual desires. And every branch of learning, conjoined with\r\nthe love of God, is approved and worthy of praise; but bereft of His love,\r\nlearning is barren--indeed, it bringeth on madness. Every kind of\r\nknowledge, every science, is as a tree: if the fruit of it be the love of\r\nGod, then is it a blessed tree, but if not, that tree is but dried-up\r\nwood, and shall only feed the fire.\r\n\r\nO thou loyal servant of God and thou spiritual healer of man! Whensoever\r\nthou dost attend a patient, turn thy face toward the Lord of the heavenly\r\nKingdom, ask the Holy Spirit to come to thine aid, then heal thou the\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n155: O THOU FLAME OF GOD'S LOVE! WHAT THOU HAST ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou flame of God's love! What thou hast written hath brought great joy,\r\nfor thy letter was as a garden from which roses of inner meanings spread\r\nabroad the sweet exhalations of the love of God. In the same way, my\r\nanswers will serve as rainshowers and dew, to bestow on those spiritual\r\nplants that have blossomed in the garden of thy heart more freshness and\r\ndelicate beauty than words can tell.\r\n\r\nThou didst write of afflictive tests that have assailed thee. To the loyal\r\nsoul, a test is but God's grace and favour; for the valiant doth joyously\r\npress forward to furious battle on the field of anguish, when the coward,\r\nwhimpering with fright, will tremble and shake. So too, the proficient\r\nstudent, who hath with great competence mastered his subjects and\r\ncommitted them to memory, will happily exhibit his skills before his\r\nexaminers on the day of his tests. So too will solid gold wondrously gleam\r\nand shine out in the assayer's fire.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that tests and trials are, for sanctified souls, but\r\nGod's bounty and grace, while to the weak, they are a calamity, unexpected\r\nand sudden.\r\n\r\nThese tests, even as thou didst write, do but cleanse the spotting of self\r\nfrom off the mirror of the heart, till the Sun of Truth can cast its rays\r\nthereon; for there is no veil more obstructive than the self, and however\r\ntenuous that veil may be, at the last it will completely shut a person\r\nout, and deprive him of his portion of eternal grace.\r\n\r\nO thou enraptured handmaid of the Lord! When the believers, men and women,\r\npass in thought before my eyes, I feel myself warmed at the fire of God's\r\nlove, and I pray that the Almighty will succour those holy souls with His\r\ninvisible hosts. Praised be the Lord that the prophecies of all His\r\nManifestations have now been clearly fulfilled, in this greatest of all\r\ndays, this holy and blessed age.\r\n\r\nO thou enraptured handmaid of God! Nearness is verily of the soul, not of\r\nthe body; and the help that is sought, and the help that cometh, is not\r\nmaterial but of the spirit; nevertheless it is my hope that thou wilt\r\nattain to nearness in every sense. The bounties of God will verily\r\nencompass a sanctified soul even as the sun's light doth the moon and\r\nstars: be thou assured of this.\r\n\r\nWaft thou to each one of the believers, men and women alike, fragrant\r\nbreaths of holiness on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Inspire them all and urge\r\nthem on to shed abroad the sweet savours of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n156: O THOU SERVANT OF THE HOLY THRESHOLD! WE HAVE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou servant of the Holy Threshold! We have read what flowed out from\r\nthy pen in thy love for God, and found the contents of thy letter most\r\npleasing. My hope is that through the bounty of God, the breaths of the\r\nAll-Merciful will at all times refresh and renew thee.\r\n\r\nThou didst write of reincarnation. A belief in reincarnation goeth far\r\nback into the ancient history of almost all peoples, and was held even by\r\nthe philosophers of Greece, the Roman sages, the ancient Egyptians, and\r\nthe great Assyrians. Nevertheless such superstitions and sayings are but\r\nabsurdities in the sight of God.\r\n\r\nThe major argument of the reincarnationists was this, that according to\r\nthe justice of God, each must receive his due: whenever a man is afflicted\r\nwith some calamity, for example, this is because of some wrong he hath\r\ncommitted. But take a child that is still in its mother's womb, the embryo\r\nbut newly formed, and that child is blind, deaf, lame, defective--what sin\r\nhath such a child committed, to deserve its afflictions? They answer that,\r\nalthough to outward seeming the child, still in the womb, is guilty of no\r\nsin--nevertheless he perpetrated some wrong when in his previous form, and\r\nthus he came to deserve his punishment.\r\n\r\nThese individuals, however, have overlooked the following point. If\r\ncreation went forward according to only one rule, how could the\r\nall-encompassing Power make Itself felt? How could the Almighty be the One\r\nWho 'doeth as He pleaseth and ordaineth as He willeth'?(51)\r\n\r\nBriefly, a return is indeed referred to in the Holy Scriptures, but by\r\nthis is meant the return of the qualities, conditions, effects,\r\nperfections, and inner realities of the lights which recur in every\r\ndispensation. The reference is not to specific, individual souls and\r\nidentities.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, for instance, that this lamplight is last night's come\r\nback again, or that last year's rose hath returned to the garden this\r\nyear. Here the reference is not to the individual reality, the fixed\r\nidentity, the specialized being of that other rose, rather doth it mean\r\nthat the qualities, the distinctive characteristics of that other light,\r\nthat other flower, are present now, in these. Those perfections, that is,\r\nthose graces and gifts of a former springtime are back again this year. We\r\nsay, for example, that this fruit is the same as last year's; but we are\r\nthinking only of the delicacy, bloom and freshness, and the sweet taste of\r\nit; for it is obvious that that impregnable centre of reality, that\r\nspecific identity, can never return.\r\n\r\nWhat peace, what ease and comfort did the Holy Ones of God ever discover\r\nduring Their sojourn in this nether world, that They should continually\r\nseek to come back and live this life again? Doth not a single turn at this\r\nanguish, these afflictions, these calamities, these body blows, these dire\r\nstraits, suffice, that They should wish for repeated visits to the life of\r\nthis world? This cup was not so sweet that one would care to drink of it a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nTherefore do the lovers of the Abha Beauty wish for no other recompense\r\nbut to reach that station where they may gaze upon Him in the Realm of\r\nGlory, and they walk no other path save over desert sands of longing for\r\nthose exalted heights. They seek that ease and solace which will abide\r\nforever, and those bestowals that are sanctified beyond the understanding\r\nof the worldly mind.\r\n\r\nWhen thou lookest about thee with a perceptive eye, thou wilt note that on\r\nthis dusty earth all humankind are suffering. Here no man is at rest as a\r\nreward for what he hath performed in former lives; nor is there anyone so\r\nblissful as seemingly to pluck the fruit of bygone anguish. And if a human\r\nlife, with its spiritual being, were limited to this earthly span, then\r\nwhat would be the harvest of creation? Indeed, what would be the effects\r\nand the outcomes of Divinity Itself? Were such a notion true, then all\r\ncreated things, all contingent realities, and this whole world of\r\nbeing--all would be meaningless. God forbid that one should hold to such a\r\nfiction and gross error.\r\n\r\nFor just as the effects and the fruitage of the uterine life are not to be\r\nfound in that dark and narrow place, and only when the child is\r\ntransferred to this wide earth do the benefits and uses of growth and\r\ndevelopment in that previous world become revealed--so likewise reward and\r\npunishment, heaven and hell, requital and retribution for actions done in\r\nthis present life, will stand revealed in that other world beyond. And\r\njust as, if human life in the womb were limited to that uterine world,\r\nexistence there would be nonsensical, irrelevant--so too if the life of\r\nthis world, the deeds here done and their fruitage, did not come forth in\r\nthe world beyond, the whole process would be irrational and foolish.\r\n\r\nKnow then that the Lord God possesseth invisible realms which the human\r\nintellect can never hope to fathom nor the mind of man conceive. When once\r\nthou hast cleansed the channel of thy spiritual sense from the pollution\r\nof this worldly life, then wilt thou breathe in the sweet scents of\r\nholiness that blow from the blissful bowers of that heavenly land.\r\n\r\nThe Glory rest upon thee, and upon whosoever turneth toward and gazeth on\r\nthe Kingdom of the All-Glorious, which the Lord hath sanctified beyond the\r\nunderstanding of those who are neglectful of Him, and hath hid from the\r\neyes of those who show Him pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n157: O YE WHO ARE STRONGLY ATTRACTED! O YE WHO ARE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye who are strongly attracted! O ye who are mindful! O ye who are\r\nadvancing unto the Kingdom of God! Verily with all my heart and soul and\r\nwith all lowliness do I supplicate the Lord God to make of you ensigns of\r\nguidance, banners of righteousness, well-springs of understanding and\r\nknowledge, that through you He may lead the seekers unto the straight path\r\nand guide them to the broad way of truth in this mightiest of ages.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! Know ye that the world is even as a mirage rising\r\nover the sands, that the thirsty mistaketh for water. The wine of this\r\nworld is but a vapour in the desert, its pity and compassion but toil and\r\ntrouble, the repose it proffereth only weariness and sorrow. Abandon it to\r\nthose who belong to it, and turn your faces unto the Kingdom of your Lord\r\nthe All-Merciful, that His grace and bounty may cast their dawning\r\nsplendours over you, and a heavenly table may be sent down for you, and\r\nyour Lord may bless you, and shower His riches upon you to gladden your\r\nbosoms and fill your hearts with bliss, to attract your minds, and cleanse\r\nyour souls, and console your eyes.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! Is there any giver save God? He singleth out for\r\nHis mercy whomsoever He willeth. Erelong will He open before you the gates\r\nof His knowledge and fill up your hearts with His love. He will cheer your\r\nsouls with the gentle winds of His holiness and make bright your faces\r\nwith the splendours of His lights, and exalt the memory of you amongst all\r\npeoples. Your Lord is verily the Compassionate, the Merciful.\r\n\r\nHe will come to your aid with invisible hosts, and support you with armies\r\nof inspiration from the Concourse above; He will send unto you sweet\r\nperfumes from the highest Paradise, and waft over you the pure breathings\r\nthat blow from the rose gardens of the Company on high. He will breathe\r\ninto your hearts the spirit of life, cause you to enter the Ark of\r\nsalvation, and reveal unto you His clear tokens and signs. Verily is this\r\nabounding grace. Verily is this the victory that none can deny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n158: GRIEVE THOU NOT OVER THE ASCENSION OF MY BELOVED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nGrieve thou not over the ascension of my beloved Breakwell, for he hath\r\nrisen unto a rose garden of splendours within the Abha Paradise, sheltered\r\nby the mercy of his mighty Lord, and he is crying at the top of his voice:\r\n'O that my people could know how graciously my Lord hath forgiven me, and\r\nmade me to be of those who have attained His Presence!'(52)\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nWhere now is thy fair face? Where is thy fluent tongue? Where thy clear\r\nbrow? Where thy bright comeliness?\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nWhere is thy fire, blazing with God's love? Where is thy rapture at His\r\nholy breaths? Where are thy praises, lifted unto Him? Where is thy rising\r\nup to serve His Cause?\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nWhere are thy beauteous eyes? Thy smiling lips? The princely cheek? The\r\ngraceful form?\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nThou hast quit this earthly world and risen upward to the Kingdom, thou\r\nhast reached unto the grace of the invisible realm, and offered thyself at\r\nthe threshold of its Lord.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nThou hast left the lamp that was thy body here, the glass that was thy\r\nhuman form, thy earthy elements, thy way of life below.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nThou hast lit a flame within the lamp of the Company on high, thou hast\r\nset foot in the Abha Paradise, thou hast found a shelter in the shadow of\r\nthe Blessed Tree, thou hast attained His meeting in the haven of Heaven.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nThou art now a bird of Heaven, thou hast quit thine earthly nest, and\r\nsoared away to a garden of holiness in the kingdom of thy Lord. Thou hast\r\nrisen to a station filled with light.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nThy song is even as birdsong now, thou pourest forth verses as to the\r\nmercy of thy Lord; of Him Who forgiveth ever, thou wert a thankful\r\nservant, wherefore hast thou entered into exceeding bliss.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nThy Lord hath verily singled thee out for His love, and hath led thee into\r\nHis precincts of holiness, and made thee to enter the garden of those who\r\nare His close companions, and hath blessed thee with beholding His beauty.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nThou hast won eternal life, and the bounty that faileth never, and a life\r\nto please thee well, and plenteous grace.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nThou art become a star in the supernal sky, and a lamp amid the angels of\r\nhigh Heaven; a living spirit in the most exalted Kingdom, throned in\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nI ask of God to draw thee ever closer, hold thee ever faster; to rejoice\r\nthy heart with nearness to His presence, to fill thee with light and still\r\nmore light, to grant thee still more beauty, and to bestow upon thee power\r\nand great glory.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\nAt all times do I call thee to mind. I shall never forget thee. I pray for\r\nthee by day, by night; I see thee plain before me, as if in open day.\r\n\r\nO Breakwell, O my dear one!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n159: AS TO THY QUESTION, DOTH EVERY SOUL WITHOUT ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to thy question, doth every soul without exception achieve life\r\neverlasting? Know thou that immortality belongeth to those souls in whom\r\nhath been breathed the spirit of life from God. All save these are\r\nlifeless--they are the dead, even as Christ hath explained in the Gospel\r\ntext. He whose eyes the Lord hath opened will see the souls of men in the\r\nstations they will occupy after their release from the body. He will find\r\nthe living ones thriving within the precincts of their Lord, and the dead\r\nsunk down in the lowest abyss of perdition.\r\n\r\nKnow thou that every soul is fashioned after the nature of God, each being\r\npure and holy at his birth. Afterwards, however, the individuals will vary\r\naccording to what they acquire of virtues or vices in this world. Although\r\nall existent beings are in their very nature created in ranks or degrees,\r\nfor capacities are various, nevertheless every individual is born holy and\r\npure, and only thereafter may he become defiled.\r\n\r\nAnd further, although the degrees of being are various, yet all are good.\r\nObserve the human body, its limbs, its members, the eye, the ear, the\r\norgans of smell, of taste, the hands, the fingernails. Notwithstanding the\r\ndifferences among all these parts, each one within the limitations of its\r\nown being participateth in a coherent whole. If one of them faileth it\r\nmust be healed, and should no remedy avail, that part must be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n160: O THOU SINCERE AND LOYAL HANDMAID OF THE LORD! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou sincere and loyal handmaid of the Lord! I have read thy letter.\r\nThou art truly attached to the Kingdom and devoted to the All-Glorious\r\nHorizon. I beg of God in His bounty to make thee to burn ever more\r\nbrightly in the fire of His love, as each day passeth by.\r\n\r\nThou wert, it appeareth, in doubt as to whether to write, or to teach the\r\nFaith. Teaching the Faith is essential, and for the present teaching is\r\npreferable for thee. Whensoever thou dost find an opportunity, loose thy\r\ntongue and guide the human race.\r\n\r\nThou didst ask as to acquiring knowledge: read thou the Books and Tablets\r\nof God, and the articles written to demonstrate the truth of this Faith.\r\nIncluded among them are the Iqan, which hath been translated into English,\r\nthe works of Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, and those of some others among the\r\nbelievers. In the days to come a great number of holy Tablets and other\r\nsacred writings will be translated, and thou shouldst read these as well.\r\nLikewise, ask thou of God that the magnet of His love should draw unto\r\nthee the knowledge of Him. Once a soul becometh holy in all things,\r\npurified, sanctified, the gates of the knowledge of God will open wide\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\nThou hast written of the dear handmaid of God, Mrs. Goodall. That soul\r\nenraptured of God is truly serving the Faith at all times, and doing\r\nwhatever she can to scatter abroad the heavenly splendours. If she\r\ncontinue in this same way, very great results will follow in a time to\r\ncome. The main thing is to remain staunch and firmly rooted, and persevere\r\nto the end. It is my hope that through the high endeavours of the\r\nhandmaids of the Lord, those foothills and that ocean(53) shore will grow\r\nso bright with the love of God as to cast their beams to the ends of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThou didst ask whether, at the advent of the Kingdom of God, every soul\r\nwas saved. The Sun of Truth hath shone forth in splendour over all the\r\nworld, and its luminous rising is man's salvation and his eternal life--but\r\nonly he is of the saved who hath opened wide the eye of his discernment\r\nand beheld that glory.\r\n\r\nLikewise didst thou ask whether, in this Baha'i Dispensation, the\r\nspiritual will ultimately prevail. It is certain that spirituality will\r\ndefeat materialism, that the heavenly will subdue the human, and that\r\nthrough divine education the masses of mankind generally will take great\r\nsteps forward in all degrees of life--except for those who are blind and\r\ndeaf and mute and dead. How can such as they understand the light? Though\r\nthe sun's rays illumine every darkest corner of the globe, still the blind\r\ncan have no share in the glory, and though the rain of heavenly mercy come\r\ndown in torrents over all the earth, no shrub or flower will bloom from a\r\nbarren land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n161: O THOU WHO SEEKEST THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who seekest the Kingdom of heaven! This world is even as the body\r\nof man, and the Kingdom of God is as the spirit of life. See how dark and\r\nnarrow is the physical world of man's body, and what a prey it is to\r\ndiseases and ills. On the other hand, how fresh and bright is the realm of\r\nthe human spirit. Judge thou from this metaphor how the world of the\r\nKingdom hath shone down, and how its laws have been made to work in this\r\nnether realm. Although the spirit is hidden from view, still its\r\ncommandments shine out like rays of light upon the world of the human\r\nbody. In the same way, although the Kingdom of heaven is hidden from the\r\nsight of this unwitting people, still, to him who seeth with the inner\r\neye, it is plain as day.\r\n\r\nWherefore dwell thou ever in the Kingdom, and be thou oblivious of this\r\nworld below. Be thou so wholly absorbed in the emanations of the spirit\r\nthat nothing in the world of man will distract thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n162: O YE DEAR FRIENDS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! AT ALL TIMES ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye dear friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha! At all times do I await your good news,\r\nlonging as I do to hear that ye are making progress from day to day, and\r\nare becoming ever more illumined by the light of guidance.\r\n\r\nThe blessings of Baha'u'llah are a shoreless sea, and even life\r\neverlasting is only a dewdrop therefrom. The waves of that sea are\r\ncontinually lapping against the hearts of the friends, and from those\r\nwaves there come intimations of the spirit and ardent pulsings of the\r\nsoul, until the heart giveth way, and willing or not, turneth humbly in\r\nprayer unto the Kingdom of the Lord. Wherefore do all ye can to disengage\r\nyour inner selves, that ye may at every moment reflect new splendours from\r\nthe Sun of Truth.\r\n\r\nYe live, all of you, within the heart of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and with every\r\nbreath do I turn my face toward the Threshold of Oneness and call down\r\nblessings upon you, each and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n163: O YE TWO SEEKERS AFTER TRUTH! YOUR LETTER WAS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye two seekers after truth! Your letter was received and its contents\r\nnoted. As for the letters ye had previously sent, not all were received,\r\nwhile some reached here at a time when the cruelty of the oppressors had\r\nso intensified that it was not possible to send a reply. Now this present\r\nletter is here, and we are able to answer it, and I have therefore set\r\nabout writing, in spite of much pressing business, so that ye will know\r\nthat ye are loved amongst us, and also accepted in the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nYour questions, however, can be answered only briefly, since there is no\r\ntime for a detailed reply. The answer to the first question: the souls of\r\nthe children of the Kingdom, after their separation from the body, ascend\r\nunto the realm of everlasting life. But if ye ask as to the place, know ye\r\nthat the world of existence is a single world, although its stations are\r\nvarious and distinct. For example, the mineral life occupieth its own\r\nplane, but a mineral entity is without any awareness at all of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, and indeed, with its inner tongue denieth that there is\r\nany such kingdom. In the same way, a vegetable entity knoweth nothing of\r\nthe animal world, remaining completely heedless and ignorant thereof, for\r\nthe stage of the animal is higher than that of the vegetable, and the\r\nvegetable is veiled from the animal world and inwardly denieth the\r\nexistence of that world--all this while animal, vegetable and mineral dwell\r\ntogether in the one world. In the same way the animal remaineth totally\r\nunaware of that power of the human mind which graspeth universal ideas and\r\nlayeth bare the secrets of creation--so that a man who liveth in the east\r\ncan make plans and arrangements for the west; can unravel mysteries;\r\nalthough located on the continent of Europe can discover America; although\r\nsited on the earth can lay hold of the inner realities of the stars of\r\nheaven. Of this power of discovery which belongeth to the human mind, this\r\npower which can grasp abstract and universal ideas, the animal remaineth\r\ntotally ignorant, and indeed denieth its existence.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the denizens of this earth are completely unaware of the\r\nworld of the Kingdom and deny the existence thereof. They ask, for\r\nexample: 'Where is the Kingdom? Where is the Lord of the Kingdom?' These\r\npeople are even as the mineral and the vegetable, who know nothing\r\nwhatever of the animal and the human realm; they see it not; they find it\r\nnot. Yet the mineral and vegetable, the animal and man, are all living\r\nhere together in this world of existence.\r\n\r\nAs to the second question: the tests and trials of God take place in this\r\nworld, not in the world of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the third question is this, that in the other world the\r\nhuman reality doth not assume a physical form, rather doth it take on a\r\nheavenly form, made up of elements of that heavenly realm.\r\n\r\nAnd the answer to the fourth question: the centre of the Sun of Truth is\r\nin the supernal world--the Kingdom of God. Those souls who are pure and\r\nunsullied, upon the dissolution of their elemental frames, hasten away to\r\nthe world of God, and that world is within this world. The people of this\r\nworld, however, are unaware of that world, and are even as the mineral and\r\nthe vegetable that know nothing of the world of the animal and the world\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the fifth question is this: Baha'u'llah hath raised up the\r\ntabernacle of the oneness of mankind. Whoso seeketh shelter under this\r\nroof will certainly come forth from other dwellings.\r\n\r\nAnd to the sixth question: if on some point or other a difference ariseth\r\namong two conflicting groups, let them refer to the Centre of the Covenant\r\nfor a solution to the problem.\r\n\r\nAnd the seventh question: Baha'u'llah hath been made manifest to all\r\nmankind and He hath invited all to the table of God, the banquet of Divine\r\nbounty. Today, however, most of those who sit at that table are the poor,\r\nand this is why Christ hath said blessed are the poor, for riches do\r\nprevent the rich from entering the Kingdom; and again, He saith, 'It is\r\neasier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man\r\nto enter into the Kingdom of God.'(54) If, however, the wealth of this\r\nworld, and worldly glory and repute, do not block his entry therein, that\r\nrich man will be favoured at the Holy Threshold and accepted by the Lord\r\nof the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn brief, Baha'u'llah hath become manifest to educate all the peoples of\r\nthe world. He is the Universal Educator, whether of the rich or the poor,\r\nwhether of black or white, or of peoples from east or west, or north or\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nAmong those who visit Akka, some have made great forward strides.\r\nLightless candles, they were set alight; withered, they began to bloom;\r\ndead, they were recalled to life and went home with tidings of great joy.\r\nBut others, in truth, have simply passed through; they have only taken a\r\ntour.\r\n\r\nO ye twain who are strongly attracted to the Kingdom, thank ye God that ye\r\nhave made your home a Baha'i centre and a gathering place for the friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n164: O YE TWO FAITHFUL AND ASSURED SOULS! THE LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye two faithful and assured souls! The letter was received. Praise be to\r\nGod, it imparted good tidings. California is ready for the promulgation of\r\nthe Teachings of God. My hope is that ye may strive with heart and soul\r\nthat the sweet scent may perfume the nostrils....\r\n\r\nConvey on my behalf to Mrs. Chase respectful greetings and say: 'Mr. Chase\r\nis a twinkling star above the horizon of Truth, but at present it is still\r\nbehind the clouds; soon these shall be dispersed and the radiance of that\r\nstar shall illumine the state of California. Appreciate thou this bounty\r\nthat thou hast been his wife and companion in life.'\r\n\r\nEvery year on the anniversary of the ascension(55) of that blessed soul\r\nthe friends must visit his tomb on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Baha and in the\r\nutmost lowliness and humility should with all respect lay on his grave\r\nwreaths of flowers and spend all the day in quiet prayer, while turning\r\ntheir faces toward the Kingdom of Signs and mentioning and praising the\r\nattributes of that illustrious person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n165: O MY GOD! O MY GOD! VERILY THY SERVANT, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO my God! O my God! Verily Thy servant, humble before the majesty of Thy\r\ndivine supremacy, lowly at the door of Thy oneness, hath believed in Thee\r\nand in Thy verses, hath testified to Thy word, hath been enkindled with\r\nthe fire of Thy love, hath been immersed in the depths of the ocean of Thy\r\nknowledge, hath been attracted by Thy breezes, hath relied upon Thee, hath\r\nturned his face to Thee, hath offered his supplications to Thee, and hath\r\nbeen assured of Thy pardon and forgiveness. He hath abandoned this mortal\r\nlife and hath flown to the kingdom of immortality, yearning for the favour\r\nof meeting Thee.\r\n\r\nO Lord, glorify his station, shelter him under the pavilion of Thy supreme\r\nmercy, cause him to enter Thy glorious paradise, and perpetuate his\r\nexistence in Thine exalted rose garden, that he may plunge into the sea of\r\nlight in the world of mysteries.\r\n\r\nVerily, Thou art the Generous, the Powerful, the Forgiver and the\r\nBestower.\r\n\r\nO thou assured soul, thou maidservant of God...! Be not grieved at the\r\ndeath of thy respected husband. He hath, verily, attained the meeting of\r\nhis Lord at the seat of Truth in the presence of the potent King. Do not\r\nsuppose that thou hast lost him. The veil shall be lifted and thou shalt\r\nbehold his face illumined in the Supreme Concourse. Just as God, the\r\nExalted, hath said, 'Him will we surely quicken to a happy life.' Supreme\r\nimportance should be attached, therefore, not to this first creation but\r\nrather to the future life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n166: O SERVANT OF BAHA! BE SELF-SACRIFICING IN THE PATH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO servant of Baha! Be self-sacrificing in the path of God, and wing thy\r\nflight unto the heavens of the love of the Abha Beauty, for any movement\r\nanimated by love moveth from the periphery to the centre, from space to\r\nthe Day-Star of the universe. Perchance thou deemest this to be difficult,\r\nbut I tell thee that such cannot be the case, for when the motivating and\r\nguiding power is the divine force of magnetism it is possible, by its aid,\r\nto traverse time and space easily and swiftly. Glory be upon the people of\r\nBaha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n167: THOU HADST ASKED ABOUT FATE, PREDESTINATION AND ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThou hadst asked about fate, predestination and will. Fate and\r\npredestination consist in the necessary and indispensable relationships\r\nwhich exist in the realities of things. These relationships have been\r\nplaced in the realities of existent beings through the power of creation\r\nand every incident is a consequence of the necessary relationship. For\r\nexample, God hath created a relation between the sun and the terrestrial\r\nglobe that the rays of the sun should shine and the soil should yield.\r\nThese relationships constitute predestination, and the manifestation\r\nthereof in the plane of existence is fate. Will is that active force which\r\ncontrolleth these relationships and these incidents. Such is the epitome\r\nof the explanation of fate and predestination. I have no time for a\r\ndetailed explanation. Ponder over this; the reality of fate,\r\npredestination and will shall be made manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n168: O THOU LADY OF THE KINGDOM! PRAISE THOU GOD ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou lady of the Kingdom! Praise thou God that in this age, the age of\r\nthe dispensation of Baha'u'llah, thou hast been awakened, hast been made\r\naware of the Manifestation of the Lord of Hosts. All the people of the\r\nworld are buried in the graves of nature, or are slumbering, heedless and\r\nunaware. Just as Christ saith: 'I may come when you are not aware. The\r\ncoming of the Son of Man is like the coming of a thief into a house, the\r\nowner of which is utterly unaware.'\r\n\r\nIn brief, my hope is that from the bounties of Baha'u'llah, thou mayest\r\ndaily advance in the Kingdom, that thou mayest become a heavenly angel,\r\nconfirmed by the breaths of the Holy Spirit, and mayest erect a structure\r\nthat shall eternally remain firm and unshakeable....\r\n\r\nThese days are very precious; grasp the present opportunity and ignite a\r\ncandle that shall never be extinguished, and which shall pour out its\r\nlight eternally illuminating the world of mankind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n169: O YE TWO PATIENT SOULS! YOUR LETTER WAS RECEIVED. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye two patient souls! Your letter was received. The death of that\r\nbeloved youth and his separation from you have caused the utmost sorrow\r\nand grief; for he winged his flight in the flower of his age and the bloom\r\nof his youth to the heavenly nest. But he hath been freed from this\r\nsorrow-stricken shelter and hath turned his face toward the everlasting\r\nnest of the Kingdom, and, being delivered from a dark and narrow world,\r\nhath hastened to the sanctified realm of light; therein lieth the\r\nconsolation of our hearts.\r\n\r\nThe inscrutable divine wisdom underlieth such heart-rending occurrences.\r\nIt is as if a kind gardener transferreth a fresh and tender shrub from a\r\nconfined place to a wide open area. This transfer is not the cause of the\r\nwithering, the lessening or the destruction of that shrub; nay, on the\r\ncontrary, it maketh it to grow and thrive, acquire freshness and delicacy,\r\nbecome green and bear fruit. This hidden secret is well known to the\r\ngardener, but those souls who are unaware of this bounty suppose that the\r\ngardener, in his anger and wrath, hath uprooted the shrub. Yet to those\r\nwho are aware, this concealed fact is manifest, and this predestined\r\ndecree is considered a bounty. Do not feel grieved or disconsolate,\r\ntherefore, at the ascension of that bird of faithfulness; nay, under all\r\ncircumstances pray for that youth, supplicating for him forgiveness and\r\nthe elevation of his station.\r\n\r\nI hope that ye will attain the utmost patience, composure and resignation,\r\nand I entreat and implore at the Threshold of Oneness, begging for\r\nforgiveness and pardon. My hope from the infinite bounties of God is that\r\nHe may shelter this dove of the garden of faith, and cause him to abide on\r\nthe branch of the Supreme Concourse, that he may sing in the best of\r\nmelodies the praise and glorification of the Lord of Names and Attributes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n170: O THOU SEEKER OF THE KINGDOM! THY LETTER WAS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou seeker of the Kingdom! Thy letter was received. Thou hast written\r\nof the severe calamity that hath befallen thee--the death of thy respected\r\nhusband. That honourable man hath been so subjected to the stress and\r\nstrain of this world that his greatest wish was for deliverance from it.\r\nSuch is this mortal abode: a storehouse of afflictions and suffering. It\r\nis ignorance that binds man to it, for no comfort can be secured by any\r\nsoul in this world, from monarch down to the most humble commoner. If once\r\nthis life should offer a man a sweet cup, a hundred bitter ones will\r\nfollow; such is the condition of this world. The wise man, therefore, doth\r\nnot attach himself to this mortal life and doth not depend upon it; at\r\nsome moments, even, he eagerly wisheth for death that he may thereby be\r\nfreed from these sorrows and afflictions. Thus it is seen that some, under\r\nextreme pressure of anguish, have committed suicide.\r\n\r\nAs to thy husband, rest assured. He will be immersed in the ocean of\r\npardon and forgiveness and will become the recipient of bounty and favour.\r\nStrive thine utmost to give his child a Baha'i training so that when he\r\nattaineth maturity he may be merciful, illumined and heavenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n171: O THOU BELOVED MAIDSERVANT OF GOD, ALTHOUGH ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou beloved maidservant of God, although the loss of a son is indeed\r\nheart-breaking and beyond the limits of human endurance, yet one who\r\nknoweth and understandeth is assured that the son hath not been lost but,\r\nrather, hath stepped from this world into another, and she will find him\r\nin the divine realm. That reunion shall be for eternity, while in this\r\nworld separation is inevitable and bringeth with it a burning grief.\r\n\r\nPraise be unto God that thou hast faith, art turning thy face toward the\r\neverlasting Kingdom and believest in the existence of a heavenly world.\r\nTherefore be thou not disconsolate, do not languish, do not sigh, neither\r\nwail nor weep; for agitation and mourning deeply affect his soul in the\r\ndivine realm.\r\n\r\nThat beloved child addresseth thee from the hidden world: 'O thou kind\r\nMother, thank divine Providence that I have been freed from a small and\r\ngloomy cage and, like the birds of the meadows, have soared to the divine\r\nworld--a world which is spacious, illumined, and ever gay and jubilant.\r\nTherefore, lament not, O Mother, and be not grieved; I am not of the lost,\r\nnor have I been obliterated and destroyed. I have shaken off the mortal\r\nform and have raised my banner in this spiritual world. Following this\r\nseparation is everlasting companionship. Thou shalt find me in the heaven\r\nof the Lord, immersed in an ocean of light.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n172: PRAISE BE TO GOD, THY HEART IS ENGAGED IN THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, thy heart is engaged in the commemoration of God, thy\r\nsoul is gladdened by the glad tidings of God and thou art absorbed in\r\nprayer. The state of prayer is the best of conditions, for man is then\r\nassociating with God. Prayer verily bestoweth life, particularly when\r\noffered in private and at times, such as midnight, when freed from daily\r\ncares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n173: THOSE SOULS THAT, IN THIS DAY, ENTER THE DIVINE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThose souls that, in this day, enter the divine kingdom and attain\r\neverlasting life, although materially dwelling on earth, yet in reality\r\nsoar in the realm of heaven. Their bodies may linger on earth but their\r\nspirits travel in the immensity of space. For as thoughts widen and become\r\nillumined, they acquire the power of flight and transport man to the\r\nkingdom of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n174: O YE SPIRITUAL FRIENDS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! THE LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye spiritual friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha! The letter ye had written hath\r\nbeen noted; its contents were most pleasing and bespoke your firmness and\r\nsteadfastness in the Cause of God.\r\n\r\nThat Assembly resteth in the sheltering shade of the Lord of all bounties,\r\nand it is my hope that, as beseemeth that body, it will be favoured and\r\ninvigorated by the breathings of the Holy Spirit, and that day by day ye\r\nwill love God in ever greater measure, and become more tightly bound to\r\nthe Beauty that abideth forever, to Him Who is the Light of the world. For\r\nlove of God and spiritual attraction do cleanse and purify the human heart\r\nand dress and adorn it with the spotless garment of holiness; and once the\r\nheart is entirely attached to the Lord, and bound over to the Blessed\r\nPerfection, then will the grace of God be revealed.\r\n\r\nThis love is not of the body but completely of the soul. And those souls\r\nwhose inner being is lit by the love of God are even as spreading rays of\r\nlight, and they shine out like stars of holiness in a pure and crystalline\r\nsky. For true love, real love, is the love for God, and this is sanctified\r\nbeyond the notions and imaginings of men.\r\n\r\nLet God's beloved, each and every one, be the essence of purity, the very\r\nlife of holiness, so that in every country they may become famed for their\r\nsanctity, independence of spirit, and meekness. Let them be cheered by\r\ndraughts from the eternal cup of love for God, and make merry as they\r\ndrink from the wine-vaults of Heaven. Let them behold the Blessed Beauty,\r\nand feel the flame and rapture of that meeting, and be struck dumb with\r\nawe and wonder. This is the station of the sincere; this is the way of the\r\nloyal; this is the brightness that shineth on the faces of those nigh unto\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nWherefore must the friends of God, with utter sanctity, with one accord,\r\nrise up in the spirit, in unity with one another, to such a degree that\r\nthey will become even as one being and one soul. On such a plane as this,\r\nphysical bodies play no part, rather doth the spirit take over and rule;\r\nand when its power encompasseth all then is spiritual union achieved.\r\nStrive ye by day and night to cultivate your unity to the fullest degree.\r\nLet your thoughts dwell on your own spiritual development, and close your\r\neyes to the deficiencies of other souls. Act ye in such wise, showing\r\nforth pure and goodly deeds, and modesty and humility, that ye will cause\r\nothers to be awakened.\r\n\r\nNever is it the wish of 'Abdu'l-Baha to see any being hurt, nor will He\r\nmake anyone to grieve; for man can receive no greater gift than this, that\r\nhe rejoice another's heart. I beg of God that ye will be bringers of joy,\r\neven as are the angels in Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n175: MORTAL CHARM SHALL FADE AWAY, ROSES SHALL GIVE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nMortal charm shall fade away, roses shall give way to thorns, and beauty\r\nand youth shall live their day and be no more. But that which eternally\r\nendureth is the Beauty of the True One, for its splendour perisheth not\r\nand its glory lasteth for ever; its charm is all-powerful and its\r\nattraction infinite. Well is it then with that countenance that reflecteth\r\nthe splendour of the Light of the Beloved One! The Lord be praised, thou\r\nhast been illumined with this Light, hast acquired the pearl of true\r\nknowledge, and hast spoken the Word of Truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n176: O THOU WHO ART ATTRACTED TO THE KINGDOM OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art attracted to the Kingdom of God! Every soul seeketh an\r\nobject and cherisheth a desire, and day and night striveth to attain his\r\naim. One craveth riches, another thirsteth for glory and still another\r\nyearneth for fame, for art, for prosperity and the like. Yet finally all\r\nare doomed to loss and disappointment. One and all they leave behind them\r\nall that is theirs and empty-handed hasten to the realm beyond, and all\r\ntheir labours shall be in vain. To dust they shall all return, denuded,\r\ndepressed, disheartened and in utter despair.\r\n\r\nBut, praised be the Lord, thou art engaged in that which secureth for thee\r\na gain that shall eternally endure; and that is naught but thine\r\nattraction to the Kingdom of God, thy faith, and thy knowledge, the\r\nenlightenment of thine heart, and thine earnest endeavour to promote the\r\nDivine Teachings.\r\n\r\nVerily this gift is imperishable and this wealth is a treasure from on\r\nhigh!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n177: O LIVING FLAME OF HEAVENLY LOVE! THINE HEART ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO living flame of heavenly love! Thine heart hath been so fired with the\r\nlove of God that from ten thousand leagues afar its warmth and radiance\r\nmay be felt and seen. The fire lit by mortal hand imparteth light and\r\nwarmth to but a little space, whereas that sacred flame which the Hand of\r\nGod hath kindled, though burning in the east, will set aflame the west and\r\ngive warmth to both the north and the south; nay, it shall rise from this\r\nworld to glow with the hottest flame in the realms on high, flooding with\r\nlight the Kingdom of eternal glory.\r\n\r\nHappy art thou to have obtained so heavenly a gift. Blessed art thou to be\r\nfavoured with His divine bestowals.\r\n\r\nThe glory of God rest upon thee and upon them that hold fast unto the sure\r\nhandle of His Will and holy Covenant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n178: O MAIDSERVANT OF GOD! THY LETTER DATED 9 ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO maidservant of God! Thy letter dated 9 December 1918 was received. Its\r\ncontents were noted. Never lose thy trust in God. Be thou ever hopeful,\r\nfor the bounties of God never cease to flow upon man. If viewed from one\r\nperspective they seem to decrease, but from another they are full and\r\ncomplete. Man is under all conditions immersed in a sea of God's\r\nblessings. Therefore, be thou not hopeless under any circumstances, but\r\nrather be firm in thy hope.\r\n\r\nAttendance at the gatherings of the friends is specifically to keep them\r\nalert, vigilant, loving and attracted to the divine Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf thou hast a full and eager desire to travel to Phillsburg, Montana,\r\nthou art permitted, perchance thou mayest be able to ignite a candle amid\r\nthat group of miners and may make them awake and vigilant so that they may\r\nturn to God and may acquire a share from the Bounty of the divine Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n179: STRIVE AS MUCH AS YE CAN TO TURN WHOLLY TOWARD ...\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive as much as ye can to turn wholly toward the Kingdom, that ye may\r\nacquire innate courage and ideal power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n180: I HOPE THAT IN THIS NETHER WORLD THOU SHALT ATTAIN ...\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope that in this nether world thou shalt attain unto heavenly light,\r\nthou wilt free the souls from the gloom of nature, which is the animal\r\nkingdom, and cause them to reach lofty stations in the human kingdom.\r\nToday all people are immersed in the world of nature. That is why thou\r\ndost see jealousy, greed, the struggle for survival, deception, hypocrisy,\r\ntyranny, oppression, disputes, strife, bloodshed, looting and pillaging,\r\nwhich all emanate from the world of nature. Few are those who have been\r\nfreed from this darkness, who have ascended from the world of nature to\r\nthe world of man, who have followed the divine Teachings, have served the\r\nworld of humanity, are resplendent, merciful, illumined and like unto a\r\nrose garden. Strive thine utmost to become godlike, characterized with His\r\nattributes, illumined and merciful, that thou mayest be freed from every\r\nbond and become attached at heart to the Kingdom of the incomparable Lord.\r\nThis is Baha'i bounty, and this is heavenly light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n181: REGARDING THE STATEMENT IN THE HIDDEN WORDS, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the statement in The Hidden Words, that man must renounce his\r\nown self, the meaning is that he must renounce his inordinate desires, his\r\nselfish purposes and the promptings of his human self, and seek out the\r\nholy breathings of the spirit, and follow the yearnings of his higher\r\nself, and immerse himself in the sea of sacrifice, with his heart fixed\r\nupon the beauty of the All-Glorious.\r\n\r\nAs for the reference in The Hidden Words regarding the Covenant entered\r\ninto on Mount Paran, this signifieth that in the sight of God the past,\r\nthe present and the future are all one and the same--whereas, relative to\r\nman, the past is gone and forgotten, the present is fleeting, and the\r\nfuture is within the realm of hope. And it is a basic principle of the Law\r\nof God that in every Prophetic Mission, He entereth into a Covenant with\r\nall believers--a Covenant that endureth until the end of that Mission,\r\nuntil the promised day when the Personage stipulated at the outset of the\r\nMission is made manifest. Consider Moses, He Who conversed with God.\r\nVerily, upon Mount Sinai, Moses entered into a Covenant regarding the\r\nMessiah, with all those souls who would live in the day of the Messiah.\r\nAnd those souls, although they appeared many centuries after Moses, were\r\nnevertheless--so far as the Covenant, which is outside time, was\r\nconcerned--present there with Moses. The Jews, however, were heedless of\r\nthis and remembered it not, and thus they suffered a great and clear loss.\r\n\r\nAs to the reference in the Arabic Hidden Words that the human being must\r\nbecome detached from self, here too the meaning is that he should not seek\r\nout anything whatever for his own self in this swiftly-passing life, but\r\nthat he should cut the self away, that is, he should yield up the self and\r\nall its concerns on the field of martyrdom, at the time of the coming of\r\nthe Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n182: O YE WHO ARE HOLDING FAST UNTO THE COVENANT AND ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye who are holding fast unto the Covenant and Testament! This day, from\r\nthe realms of the All-Glorious, from the Kingdom of Holiness where\r\nhosannas of glorification and praise rise up, the Company on high direct\r\ntheir gaze upon you. Whensoever their gaze lighteth upon gatherings of\r\nthose who are steadfast in the Covenant and Testament, then do they utter\r\ntheir cry, 'Glad tidings! Glad tidings!' Then, exulting, do they lift up\r\ntheir voices, and shout, 'O ye spiritual communion! O ye gathering of God!\r\nBlessed are ye! Glad tidings be unto you! Bright be your faces, and be ye\r\nof good cheer, for ye cling to the Covenant of the Beloved of all the\r\nworlds, ye are on fire with the wine of His Testament. Ye have plighted\r\nyour troth to the Ancient of Days, ye have drunk deep from the chalice of\r\nloyalty. Ye have guarded and defended the Cause of God; ye have not been a\r\ncause of dividing up His Word; ye have not brought His Faith low, but have\r\nstriven to glorify His Holy Name; ye have not allowed the Blessed Cause to\r\nbe exposed to the derision of the people. Ye have not permitted the\r\nDesignated Station to be humbled, nor been willing to see the Centre of\r\nAuthority discredited or exposed to mockery and persecution. Ye have\r\nstriven to keep the Word whole and one. Ye have passed through the portals\r\nof mercy. Ye have not let the Blessed Beauty slip from your minds, to fade\r\nunremembered.'\r\n\r\nThe Glory rest upon you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n183: O THOU DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM! THY LETTER WAS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou daughter of the Kingdom! Thy letter was received. It was like the\r\nmelody of the divine nightingale, whose song delighteth the hearts. This\r\nis because its contents indicated faith, assurance and firmness in the\r\nCovenant and the Testament. Today the dynamic power of the world of\r\nexistence is the power of the Covenant which like unto an artery pulsateth\r\nin the body of the contingent world and protecteth Baha'i unity.\r\n\r\nThe Baha'is are commanded to establish the oneness of mankind; if they\r\ncannot unite around one point how will they be able to bring about the\r\nunity of mankind?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Blessed Beauty in entering into this Covenant and\r\nTestament was to gather all existent beings around one point so that the\r\nthoughtless souls, who in every cycle and generation have been the cause\r\nof dissension, may not undermine the Cause. He hath, therefore, commanded\r\nthat whatever emanateth from the Centre of the Covenant is right and is\r\nunder His protection and favour, while all else is error.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, thou art firm in the Covenant and the Testament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n184: O YE BLESSED SOULS! ALTHOUGH YE ARE UNDERGOING ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye blessed souls! Although ye are undergoing crucial tests in view of\r\nthe repeated and assiduous attempts of some people to shake the faith of\r\nthe friends in Los Angeles, yet ye are under the guarding eye of the\r\nbounty of Baha'u'llah and are assisted by legions of angels.\r\n\r\nWalk, therefore, with a sure step and engage with the utmost assurance and\r\nconfidence in the promulgation of the divine fragrances, the glorification\r\nof the Word of God and firmness in the Covenant. Rest ye assured that if a\r\nsoul ariseth in the utmost perseverance and raiseth the Call of the\r\nKingdom and resolutely promulgateth the Covenant, be he an insignificant\r\nant he shall be enabled to drive away the formidable elephant from the\r\narena, and if he be a feeble moth he shall cut to pieces the plumage of\r\nthe rapacious vulture.\r\n\r\nEndeavour, therefore, that ye may scatter and disperse the army of doubt\r\nand of error with the power of the holy utterances. This is my exhortation\r\nand this is my counsel. Do not quarrel with anybody, and shun every form\r\nof dispute. Utter the Word of God. If he accepteth it the desired purpose\r\nis attained, and if he turneth away leave him to himself and trust to God.\r\n\r\nSuch is the attribute of those who are firm in the Covenant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n185: O YE FRIENDS AND MAIDSERVANTS OF THE MERCIFUL! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye friends and maidservants of the Merciful! From the Spiritual Assembly\r\nof Los Angeles a letter hath been received. It was indicative of the fact\r\nthat the blessed souls in California, like unto an immovable mountain, are\r\nwithstanding the gale of violation, have, like unto blessed trees, been\r\nplanted in the soil of the Covenant and are most firm and steadfast. The\r\nhope is entertained, therefore, that through the blessings of the Sun of\r\nTruth they may daily increase in their firmness and steadfastness. The\r\ntests of every dispensation are in direct proportion to the greatness of\r\nthe Cause, and as heretofore such a manifest Covenant, written by the\r\nSupreme Pen, hath not been entered upon, the tests are proportionately\r\nmore severe. These trials cause the feeble souls to waver while those who\r\nare firm are not affected. These agitations of the violators are no more\r\nthan the foam of the ocean, which is one of its inseparable features; but\r\nthe ocean of the Covenant shall surge and shall cast ashore the bodies of\r\nthe dead, for it cannot retain them. Thus it is seen that the ocean of the\r\nCovenant hath surged and surged until it hath thrown out the dead\r\nbodies--souls that are deprived of the Spirit of God and are lost in\r\npassion and self and are seeking leadership. This foam of the ocean shall\r\nnot endure and shall soon disperse and vanish, while the ocean of the\r\nCovenant shall eternally surge and roar....\r\n\r\nFrom the early days of creation down to the present time, throughout all\r\nthe divine dispensations, such a firm and explicit Covenant hath not been\r\nentered upon. In view of this fact is it possible for this foam to remain\r\non the surface of the ocean of the Covenant? No, by God! The violators are\r\ntrampling upon their own dignity, are uprooting their own foundations and\r\nare proud at being upheld by flatterers who exert a great effort to shake\r\nthe faith of feeble souls. But this action of theirs is of no consequence;\r\nit is a mirage and not water, foam and not the sea, mist and not a cloud,\r\nillusion and not reality. All this ye shall soon see.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, ye are firm and steadfast; be ye thankful that like unto\r\nblessed trees ye are firmly planted in the soil of the Covenant. It is\r\nsure that every firm one will grow, will yield new fruits and will\r\nincrease daily in freshness and grace. Reflect upon all the writings of\r\nBaha'u'llah, whether epistles or prayers, and ye shall surely come across\r\na thousand passages wherein Baha'u'llah prays: 'O God! Bring to naught the\r\nviolators of the Covenant and defeat the oppressors of the Testament.' 'He\r\nwho denieth the Covenant and the Testament is rejected by God, and he who\r\nremaineth firm and steadfast therein is favoured at the Threshold of\r\nOneness.' Such sayings and prayers abound, refer to them and ye shall\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nNever be depressed. The more ye are stirred by violation, the more deepen\r\nye in firmness and steadfastness, and be assured that the divine hosts\r\nshall conquer, for they are assured of the victory of the Abha Kingdom.\r\nThroughout all regions the standard of firmness and steadfastness is\r\nupraised and the flag of violation is debased, for only a few weak souls\r\nhave been led away by the flattery and the specious arguments of the\r\nviolators who are outwardly with the greatest care exhibiting firmness but\r\ninwardly are engaged in agitating souls. Only a few who are the leaders of\r\nthose who stir and agitate are outwardly known as violators while the\r\nrest, through subtle means, deceive the souls, for outwardly they assert\r\ntheir firmness and steadfastness in the Covenant but when they come across\r\nresponsive ears they secretly sow the seeds of suspicion. The case of all\r\nof them resembleth the violation of the Covenant by Judas Iscariot and his\r\nfollowers. Consider: hath any result or trace remained after them? Not\r\neven a name hath been left by his followers and although a number of Jews\r\nsided with him it was as if he had no followers at all. This Judas\r\nIscariot who was the leader of the apostles betrayed Christ for thirty\r\npieces of silver. Take heed, O ye people of perception!\r\n\r\nAt this time these insignificant violators will surely betray the Centre\r\nof the Covenant for the large sum which by every subtle means they have\r\nbegged. It is now thirty years since Baha'u'llah ascended, and in that\r\ntime these violators have striven with might and main. What have they\r\nachieved? Under all conditions those who have remained firm in the\r\nCovenant have conquered, while the violators have met defeat,\r\ndisappointment and dejection. After the ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha, no\r\ntrace of them shall remain. These souls are ignorant of what will happen\r\nand are proud of their own fancies.\r\n\r\nIn short, O ye friends of God and maidservants of the Merciful! The hand\r\nof divine bounty hath placed upon your heads a jewelled crown, the\r\nprecious gems of which shall shine eternally over all regions. Appreciate\r\nthis bounty, loose your tongues in praise and thanksgiving, and engage in\r\nthe promulgation of the divine teachings, for this is the spirit of life\r\nand the means of salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n186: O THOU WHO ART FIRM IN THE COVENANT! THREE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art firm in the Covenant! Three consecutive letters have been\r\nreceived from thee. From their contents it became known that in Cleveland\r\nthe hearts are afflicted by the murky breaths of the Covenant-breakers and\r\nharmony hath decreased among the friends. Gracious God! A hundred times it\r\nhath been foretold that the violators are lying in ambush and by every\r\nmeans desire to cause dissension among the friends so that this dissension\r\nmay end in violation of the Covenant. How is it that, notwithstanding this\r\nwarning, the friends have neglected this explicit statement?\r\n\r\nThe point at issue is clear, direct and of utmost brevity. Either\r\nBaha'u'llah was wise, omniscient and aware of what would ensue, or was\r\nignorant and in error. He entered, by His supreme pen, into such a firm\r\nCovenant and Testament with all the Baha'is, first with the A_gh_san, the\r\nAfnan and His kindred, and commanded them to obey and turn toward Him. By\r\nHis supreme pen He hath explicitly declared that the object of the\r\nfollowing verse of the Kitab-i-Aqdas is the Most Great Branch:\r\n\r\n'When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is\r\nended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath\r\nbranched from this Ancient Root.' Its meaning briefly is this: that after\r\nMy ascension it is incumbent upon the A_gh_san, the Afnan and the kindred,\r\nand all the friends of God, to turn their faces to Him Who hath branched\r\nfrom the Ancient Root.\r\n\r\nHe also plainly saith in the Kitab-i-Aqdas: 'O ye people of the world!\r\nWhen the Mystic Dove will have winged its flight from its Sanctuary of\r\nPraise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye\r\nwhatsoever ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from\r\nthis mighty Stock.' Addressing all the people of the world He saith: When\r\nthe Mystic Dove flieth away from the orchard of praise to the Most Supreme\r\nand Invisible Station--that is, when the Blessed Beauty turneth away from\r\nthe contingent world towards the invisible realm--refer whatever ye do not\r\nunderstand in the Book to Him Who hath branched from the Ancient Root.\r\nThat is, whatever He saith is the very truth.\r\n\r\nAnd in the Book of the Covenant He explicitly saith that the object of\r\nthis verse 'Who hath branched from this Ancient Root' is the Most Mighty\r\nBranch. And He commandeth all the A_gh_san, the Afnan, the kindred and the\r\nBaha'is to turn toward Him. Now, either one must say that the Blessed\r\nBeauty hath made a mistake, or He must be obeyed. 'Abdu'l-Baha hath no\r\ncommand for the people to obey save the diffusion of the fragrances of\r\nGod, the exaltation of His Word, the promulgation of the oneness of the\r\nworld of humanity, the establishment of universal peace, and other of the\r\ncommands of God. These are divine commands and have nothing to do with\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha. Whoever wisheth may accept them, and anyone who rejecteth\r\nthem may do as he pleaseth.\r\n\r\nNow some of the mischief-makers, with many stratagems, are seeking\r\nleadership, and in order to reach this position they instil doubts among\r\nthe friends that they may cause differences, and that these differences\r\nmay result in their drawing a party to themselves. But the friends of God\r\nmust be awake and must know that the scattering of these doubts hath as\r\nits motive personal desires and the achievement of leadership.\r\n\r\nDo not disrupt Baha'i unity, and know that this unity cannot be maintained\r\nsave through faith in the Covenant of God.\r\n\r\nThou hast the desire to travel that thou mayest spread the fragrances of\r\nGod. This is highly suitable. Assuredly divine confirmations will assist\r\nthee and the power of the Covenant and Testament will secure for thee\r\ntriumph and victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n187: O THOU WHO ART FIRM IN THE COVENANT! THY LETTER ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art firm in the Covenant! Thy letter was received. Thou hast\r\nexpressed satisfaction with the Convention, that this gathering hath been\r\nthe means of the elevation of the Cause of God and the demonstration of\r\nthe power of His Word. The greatness of the Cause will clear away these\r\ndifferences and may be compared to health in the body of man which, when\r\nestablished, cureth all disease and weakness. Our hope is that no trace of\r\nopposition may remain; but some of the friends in America are restless in\r\ntheir fresh ambitions and strive and seek under the ground and in the air\r\nto discover anything that breedeth dissension.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, all such doors are closed in the Cause of Baha'u'llah\r\nfor a special authoritative Centre hath been appointed--a Centre that\r\nsolveth all difficulties and wardeth off all differences. The Universal\r\nHouse of Justice, likewise, wardeth off all differences and whatever it\r\nprescribeth must be accepted and he who transgresseth is rejected. But\r\nthis Universal House of Justice which is the Legislature hath not yet been\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nThus it is seen that no means for dissension hath been left, but carnal\r\ndesires are the cause of difference as it is the case with the violators.\r\nThese do not doubt the validity of the Covenant but selfish motives have\r\ndragged them to this condition. It is not that they do not know what they\r\ndo--they are perfectly aware and still they exhibit opposition.\r\n\r\nIn short, the ocean of the Covenant is tumultuous and wide. It casteth\r\nashore the foam of violation and thus rest ye assured. Be engaged in the\r\nfurtherance of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar and prepare the means for the\r\ndiffusion of the divine fragrances. Be not engaged in anything but this,\r\nfor otherwise thou shalt dissipate thine attention and the work will not\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n188: O YE THE CHERISHED LOVED ONES OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye the cherished loved ones of 'Abdu'l-Baha! It is a long time now since\r\nmy inward ear hath heard any sweet melodies out of certain regions, or my\r\nheart been gladdened; and this despite the fact that ye are ever present\r\nin my thoughts and standing clearly visible before my sight. Filled to\r\noverflowing is the goblet of my heart with the wine of the love I bear\r\nyou, and my yearning to set eyes upon you streameth like the spirit\r\nthrough my arteries and veins. From this it is clear how great is my\r\naffliction. At this time and throughout this tempest of calamities now\r\ntossing its waves to high heaven, cruel and incessant darts are being\r\nhurled against me from every point of the compass, and at every moment,\r\nhere in the Holy Land, terrifying news is received, and every day bringeth\r\nits quota of horror. The Centre of Sedition had imagined that it needed\r\nbut his arrogant rebellion to bring down the Covenant and Testament in\r\nruins; it needed but this, so he thought, to turn the righteous away from\r\nthe Holy Will. Wherefore he sent out far and wide his leaflets of doubt,\r\ndevising many a secret scheme. Now he would cry out that God's edifice had\r\nbeen subverted and His divine commands annulled, and that accordingly, the\r\nCovenant and Testament was abolished. Again he would set himself to\r\nsighing and groaning that he was being held a prisoner and was kept hungry\r\nand thirsty day and night. Another day he would raise an uproar, saying\r\nthat the oneness of God had been denied, since another Manifestation had\r\nbeen proclaimed, prior to the expiration of a thousand years.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw that his calumnies had no effect, he gradually formed a plan\r\nto incite a disturbance. He began stirring up mischief, and went knocking\r\nat every door. He started making false accusations to the officials of the\r\nGovernment. He approached some of the foreigners, made himself their\r\nintimate, and together with them prepared a document and presented it to\r\nthe Seat of the Sultanate, bringing consternation to the authorities.\r\nAmong the many slanderous charges was this, that this hapless one had\r\nraised up a standard of revolt, a flag bearing the words Ya Baha'u'l-Abha;\r\nthat I had paraded this throughout the countryside, to every city, town\r\nand village, and even among the desert tribes, and had summoned all the\r\ninhabitants to unite under this flag.\r\n\r\nO my Lord, verily I seek refuge with Thee from the very thought of such an\r\nact, which is contrary to all the commandments of Baha'u'llah, and which\r\nwould indeed be a mighty wrong that none but a grievous sinner would ever\r\nperpetrate. For Thou hast made it incumbent upon us to obey the rulers and\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nAnother of his slanders was that the Shrine on Mount Carmel was a fortress\r\nthat I had built strong and impregnable--this when the building under\r\nconstruction compriseth six rooms--and that I had named it Medina the\r\nResplendent, while I had named the Holy Tomb(56) Mecca the Glorified. Yet\r\nanother of his calumnies was that I had established an independent\r\nsovereignty, and that--God forbid! God forbid! God forbid!--I had summoned\r\nall the believers to join me in this massive wrongdoing. How dire, O my\r\nLord, is his slander!\r\n\r\nYet again, he claimeth that since the Holy Shrine hath become a point\r\nvisited by pilgrims from all over the world, great damage will accrue to\r\nthis Government and people. He, the Centre of Sedition, averreth that he\r\nhimself hath had no hand in all these matters, that he is a Sunni of the\r\nSunnites and a devoted follower of Abu-Bakr and Umar, and regardeth\r\nBaha'u'llah as only a pious man and a mystic; all these things, he saith,\r\nwere set afoot by this wronged one.\r\n\r\nTo be brief, a Commission of Investigation was appointed by the Sultan,\r\nmay the glory of his reign endure. The Commission journeyed hither and\r\nimmediately upon arrival betook themselves to the house of one of the\r\naccusers. They then summoned the group who, working with my brother, had\r\nprepared the accusatory document and asked them whether it was true. The\r\ngroup explained the contents of the document, stated that everything they\r\nhad reported therein was nothing but the truth, and added further\r\naccusations. Thus they functioned at one and the same time as plaintiffs,\r\nwitnesses, and judge.\r\n\r\nThe Commission hath now returned to the seat of the Caliphate, and reports\r\nof a most frightful nature are coming in daily from that city. However,\r\npraised be God, 'Abdu'l-Baha remaineth composed and unperturbed. To none\r\ndo I bear ill will because of this defamation. I have made all my affairs\r\nconditioned upon His irresistible Will and I am waiting, indeed in perfect\r\nhappiness, to offer my life and prepared for whatever dire affliction may\r\nbe in store. Praise be to God, the loving believers also accept and remain\r\nsubmissive to God's Will, content with it, radiantly acquiescent, offering\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nThe Centre of Sedition hath imagined that once the blood of this wronged\r\none is spilled out, once I have been cast away on the wide desert sands or\r\ndrowned in the Mediterranean Sea--nameless, gone without trace, with none\r\nto tell of me--then would he at last have a field where he could urge his\r\nsteed ahead, and with his mallet of lies and doubts, hit hard at the polo\r\nball of his ambitions, and carry off the prize.\r\n\r\nFar from it! For even if the sweet musk-scent of faithfulness should pass,\r\nand leave no trace behind, who would be drawn by the stench of perfidy?\r\nAnd even if some gazelle of heaven were to be ripped apart by dogs and\r\nwolves, who would go running to seek out a ravening wolf? Even should the\r\nday of the Mystic Nightingale draw to its close, who would ever lend his\r\near to the raven's croak, or the cawing of the crow? What an empty\r\nsupposition is his! What a foolish presumption! 'Their works are like the\r\nvapour in a desert which the thirsty dreameth to be water, until when he\r\ncometh unto it, he findeth nothing.'(57)\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! Be ye firm of foot, and fixed of heart, and\r\nthrough the power of the Blessed Beauty's help, stand ye committed to your\r\npurpose. Serve ye the Cause of God. Face ye all nations of the world with\r\nthe constancy and the endurance of the people of Baha, that all men may be\r\nastounded and ask how this could be, that your hearts are as well-springs\r\nof confidence and faith, and as mines so rich in the love of God. Be ye\r\nso, that ye shall neither fail nor falter on account of these tragedies in\r\nthe Holy Land; let not these dread events make you despondent. And if all\r\nthe believers be put to the sword, and only one be left, let that one cry\r\nout in the name of the Lord and tell the joyous tidings; let that one rise\r\nup and confront all the peoples of the earth.\r\n\r\nGaze ye not upon the dire happenings at this Illumined Spot. The Holy Land\r\nis in danger at all times, and here, the tide of calamities is ever at the\r\nflood; for this upraised call hath now been heard around the world, and\r\nthe fame of it hath gone forth to the ends of the earth. It is because of\r\nthis that foes, both from within and from without, have turned themselves\r\nwith subtlety and craft to spreading slander. It is clear that such a\r\nplace as this would be exposed to danger, for there is no defender here,\r\nnone to arise and take our side in the face of calumny: here are only a\r\nfew souls that are homeless, hapless, held captive in this stronghold. No\r\nchampion have they; there is none to succour them, none to ward off the\r\narrows of lies, the darts of defamation that are hurled against them: none\r\nexcept God.\r\n\r\nIt behoveth you to ponder on all those well-beloved ones who hastened to\r\nthe holy field of sacrifice, those precious souls who offered up their\r\nlives. Bear ye in mind what streams of sacred blood were poured away, how\r\nmany a righteous heart was commingled with its gore, how many a breast was\r\nthe target of tyranny's spear, how many a chaste body was ripped to\r\nshreds. How then could it be right for us even to think of saving\r\nourselves! To curry favour with stranger or kin, and make a show of\r\ncompromise! Should we not, rather, take the pathway of the righteous, and\r\nfollow in the footsteps of those great ones gone before?\r\n\r\nThese few brief days shall pass away, this present life shall vanish from\r\nour sight; the roses of this world shall be fresh and fair no more, the\r\ngarden of this earth's triumphs and delights shall droop and fade. The\r\nspring season of life shall turn into the autumn of death, the bright joy\r\nof palace halls give way to moonless dark within the tomb. And therefore\r\nis none of this worth loving at all, and to this the wise will not anchor\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nHe who hath knowledge and power will rather seek out the glory of heaven,\r\nand spiritual distinction, and the life that dieth not. And such a one\r\nlongeth to approach the sacred Threshold of God; for in the tavern of this\r\nswiftly-passing world the man of God will not lie drunken, nor will he\r\neven for a moment take his ease, nor stain himself with any fondness for\r\nthis earthly life.\r\n\r\nNay rather, the friends are stars in the high heavens of guidance,\r\ncelestial bodies in the skies of divine grace, who with all their powers\r\nput the dark to flight. They break down the foundations of malevolence and\r\nhate. They cherish but one desire for the world and all its peoples:\r\nwell-being and peace. By them, the ramparts of warfare and aggression are\r\nbattered down. They have truthfulness and honest dealing and friendship\r\nfor their goal, and kindness even toward a vicious foe; until at last they\r\nchange this prison of treachery, the world, into a mansion of utmost\r\ntrust, and turn this gaol-house of hatred and malevolence and spite, into\r\nGod's Paradise.\r\n\r\nO ye loving friends! Strive ye with heart and soul to make this world the\r\nmirror-image of the Kingdom, that this nether world may teem with the\r\nblessings of the world of God, that the voices of the Company on high may\r\nbe raised in acclamation, and signs and tokens of the bounties and\r\nbestowals of Baha'u'llah may encompass all the earth.\r\n\r\nJinab-i-'Amin hath expressed the greatest admiration for you honoured men\r\nand enlightened women, naming and commending you each by each, telling at\r\nlength of the firmness and constancy ye all have shown, saying that, God\r\nbe praised, in all Persia the men and women are standing together,\r\nstraight, strong, unmoveable--a mighty edifice solidly raised up; and that\r\nye are engaged with love and joy in spreading abroad the sweet savours of\r\nthe Lord.\r\n\r\nThese were tidings of great joy, especially as they have reached me in\r\nthese days of extreme peril. For the dearest wish of this wronged one is\r\nthat the friends be spiritual of heart and illumined of mind, and once\r\nthis grace is granted me, calamity, however afflictive, is but bounty\r\npouring down upon me, like copious rain.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Thou seest me plunged in an ocean of anguish, held fast to\r\nthe fires of tyranny, and weeping in the darkness of the night. Sleepless\r\nI toss and turn upon my bed, mine eyes straining to behold the morning\r\nlight of faithfulness and trust. I agonize even as a fish, its inward\r\nparts afire as it leapeth about in terror upon the sand, yet I ever look\r\nfor Thy bestowals to appear from every side.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Make thou the believers in other lands to partake of Thine\r\nabounding grace, deliver Thou, by Thine unfailing help and bounty, whoso\r\namong Thy loved ones in the farthermost climes sigheth over the bitter\r\ncruelty of his foe. O Lord, they are the captives of Thy love, the\r\nprisoners taken by Thy troops. They are the birds that fly in the heavens\r\nof Thy guidance, the whales that swim in the ocean of Thy bestowals, the\r\nstars that sparkle on the horizon of Thy gifts. They are the defenders of\r\nthe fortress of Thy law. They are the banners of Thy remembrance amongst\r\nmen. They are the deep wells of Thy divine compassion, the fountains of\r\nThy favours, the well-springs of Thy grace.\r\n\r\nKeep them ever in safety beneath Thine all-protecting eye. Assist them to\r\nexalt Thy Word; make Thou their hearts to be constant in Thy love;\r\nstrengthen Thou their backs that they may serve Thee well; in servitude,\r\nstrengthen Thou their powers.\r\n\r\nSpread Thou through them Thy sweet savours far and wide; expound through\r\nthem Thy Holy Writ; make known through them Thine Utterance; fulfil\r\nthrough them Thy Words; through them pour out Thy mercy.\r\n\r\nThou art verily the Mighty, the Powerful. Thou art verily the Clement, the\r\nCompassionate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n189: TODAY, EVERY WISE, VIGILANT AND FORESIGHTED PERSON ...\r\n\r\n\r\nToday, every wise, vigilant and foresighted person is awakened, and to him\r\nare unveiled the mysteries of the future which show that nothing save the\r\npower of the Covenant is able to stir and move the heart of humanity, just\r\nas the New and Old Testaments propounded throughout all regions the Cause\r\nof Christ and were the pulsating power in the body of the human world. A\r\ntree that hath a root shall bear fruit, while the tree that hath none, no\r\nmatter how high and hardy it may be, will eventually wither, perish and\r\nbecome but a log fit for the fire.\r\n\r\nThe Covenant of God is like unto a vast and fathomless ocean. A billow\r\nshall rise and surge therefrom and shall cast ashore all accumulated foam.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God that the highest wish entertained by heedful souls is the\r\nexaltation of the Word of God and the propagation of divine fragrances.\r\nThis is, verily, the secure and firm foundation.\r\n\r\nNow, like unto the morn, the light of the Sun of Truth hath been shed\r\nabroad. Effort must be made that slumbering souls may be awakened, the\r\nheedless become vigilant, and that the divine teachings, which constitute\r\nthe spirit of this age, may reach the ears of the people of the world, may\r\nbe propagated in the press and set forth with brilliance and eloquence in\r\nthe assemblages of men.\r\n\r\nOne's conduct must be like the conduct of Paul, and one's faith similar to\r\nthat of Peter. This musk-scented breeze shall perfume the nostrils of the\r\npeople of the world, and this spirit shall resuscitate the dead.\r\n\r\nThe offensive odour of violation hath temporarily arrested the onward\r\nmovement of the Cause, for otherwise the divine teachings, like unto the\r\nrays of the sun, would immediately spread and permeate all regions.\r\n\r\nThou intendest to print and publish the addresses of 'Abdu'l-Baha which\r\nthou hast compiled. This is indeed very advisable. This service shall\r\ncause thee to acquire an effulgent face in the Abha Kingdom, and shall\r\nmake thee the object of the praise and gratitude of the friends in the\r\nEast as well as in the West. But it is to be undertaken with the utmost\r\ncare, so that the exact text may be reproduced and will exclude all\r\ndeviations and corruptions committed by former translators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n190: THOU SEEST ME, O MY GOD, BOWED DOWN IN LOWLINESS, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThou seest me, O my God, bowed down in lowliness, humbling myself before\r\nThy commandments, submitting to Thy sovereignty, trembling at the might of\r\nThy dominion, fleeing from Thy wrath, entreating Thy grace, relying upon\r\nThy forgiveness, shaking with awe at Thy fury. I implore Thee with a\r\nthrobbing heart, with streaming tears and a yearning soul, and in complete\r\ndetachment from all things, to make Thy lovers as rays of light across Thy\r\nrealms, and to aid Thy chosen servants to exalt Thy Word, that their faces\r\nmay turn beauteous and bright with splendour, that their hearts may be\r\nfilled with mysteries, and that every soul may lay down its burden of sin.\r\nGuard them then from the aggressor, from him who hath become a shameless\r\nand blasphemous doer of wrong.\r\n\r\nVerily Thy lovers thirst, O my Lord; lead them to the wellspring of bounty\r\nand grace. Verily, they hunger; send down unto them Thy heavenly table.\r\nVerily, they are naked; robe them in the garments of learning and\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nHeroes are they, O my Lord, lead them to the field of battle. Guides are\r\nthey, make them to speak out with arguments and proofs. Ministering\r\nservants are they, cause them to pass round the cup that brimmeth with the\r\nwine of certitude. O my God, make them to be songsters that carol in fair\r\ngardens, make them lions that couch in the thickets, whales that plunge in\r\nthe vasty deep.\r\n\r\nVerily Thou art He of abounding grace. There is none other God save Thee,\r\nthe Mighty, the Powerful, the Ever-Bestowing.\r\n\r\nO ye my spiritual friends! For some time now the pressures have been\r\nsevere, the restrictions as shackles of iron. This hapless wronged one was\r\nleft single and alone, for all the ways were barred. Friends were\r\nforbidden access to me, the trusted were shut away, the foe compassed me\r\nabout, the evil watchers were fierce and bold. At every instant, fresh\r\naffliction. At every breath, new anguish. Both kin and stranger on the\r\nattack; indeed, one-time lovers, faithless and unpitying, were worse than\r\nfoes as they rose up to harass me. None was there to defend 'Abdu'l-Baha,\r\nno helper, no protector, no ally, no champion. I was drowning in a\r\nshoreless sea, and ever beating upon my ears were the raven-croaking\r\nvoices of the disloyal.\r\n\r\nAt every daybreak, triple darkness. At eventide, stone-hearted tyranny.\r\nAnd never a moment's peace, and never any balm for the spear's red wounds.\r\nFrom moment to moment, word would come of my exile to the Fezzan sands;\r\nfrom hour to hour, I was to be cast into the endless sea. Now they would\r\nsay that these homeless wanderers were ruined at last; again that the\r\ncross would soon be put to use. This wasted frame of mine was to be made\r\nthe target for bullet or arrow; or again, this failing body was to be cut\r\nto ribbons by the sword.\r\n\r\nOur alien acquaintances could not contain themselves for joy, and our\r\ntreacherous friends exulted. 'Praise be to God,' one would exclaim, 'Here\r\nis our dream come true.' And another, 'God be thanked, our spear-head\r\nfound the heart.'\r\n\r\nAffliction beat upon this captive like the heavy rains of spring, and the\r\nvictories of the malevolent swept down in a relentless flood, and still\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha remained happy and serene, and relied on the grace of the\r\nAll-Merciful. That pain, that anguish, was a paradise of all delights;\r\nthose chains were the necklace of a king on a throne in heaven. Content\r\nwith God's will, utterly resigned, my heart surrendered to whatever fate\r\nhad in store, I was happy. For a boon companion, I had great joy.\r\n\r\nFinally a time came when the friends turned inconsolable, and abandoned\r\nall hope. It was then the morning dawned, and flooded all with unending\r\nlight. The towering clouds were scattered, the dismal shadows fled. In\r\nthat instant the fetters fell away, the chains were lifted off the neck of\r\nthis homeless one and hung round the neck of the foe. Those dire straits\r\nwere changed to ease, and on the horizon of God's bounties the sun of hope\r\nrose up. All this was out of God's grace and His bestowals.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, from one point of view, this wanderer was saddened and\r\ndespondent. For what pain, in the time to come, could I seek comfort? At\r\nthe news of what granted wish could I rejoice? There was no more tyranny,\r\nno more affliction, no tragical events, no tribulations. My only joy in\r\nthis swiftly-passing world was to tread the stony path of God and to\r\nendure hard tests and all material griefs. For otherwise, this earthly\r\nlife would prove barren and vain, and better would be death. The tree of\r\nbeing would produce no fruit; the sown field of this existence would yield\r\nno harvest. Thus it is my hope that once again some circumstance will make\r\nmy cup of anguish to brim over, and that beauteous Love, that Slayer of\r\nsouls, will dazzle the beholders again. Then will this heart be blissful,\r\nthis soul be blessed.\r\n\r\nO Divine Providence! Lift to Thy lovers' lips a cup brimful of anguish. To\r\nthe yearners on Thy pathway, make sweetness but a sting, and poison\r\nhoney-sweet. Set Thou our heads for ornaments on the points of spears.\r\nMake Thou our hearts the targets for pitiless arrows and darts. Raise Thou\r\nthis withered soul to life on the martyr's field, make Thou his faded\r\nheart to drink the draught of tyranny, and thus grow fresh and fair once\r\nmore. Make him to be drunk with the wine of Thine Eternal Covenant, make\r\nhim a reveller holding high his cup. Help him to fling away his life;\r\ngrant that for Thy sake, he be offered up.\r\n\r\nThou art the Mighty, the Powerful. Thou art the Knower, the Seer, the\r\nHearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n191: O THOU WHO HAST BEEN SORE AFFLICTED ON THE PATHWAY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who hast been sore afflicted on the pathway of the Covenant!\r\nAnguish and torment, when suffered on the pathway of the Lord, Him of\r\nmanifest signs, is only favour and grace; affliction is but mercy, and\r\ngrief a gift from God. Poison is sugar on the tongue, and wrath is\r\nkindness, nourishing the soul.\r\n\r\nThen praise thou Him, the loving Provider, for having ordained this dire\r\naffliction, which is but bounty unalloyed.\r\n\r\nIf I, like Abraham, through flames must go,\r\nOr yet like John(58) a bloodstained road must run;\r\nIf, Joseph-like, Thou'd cast me in a well,\r\nOr shut me up within a prison cell--\r\nOr make me e'en as poor as Mary's Son--\r\nI will not go from Thee,\r\nBut ever stand\r\nMy soul and body bowed to Thy command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n192: TODAY, THE LORD OF HOSTS IS THE DEFENDER OF THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nToday, the Lord of Hosts is the defender of the Covenant, the forces of\r\nthe Kingdom protect it, heavenly souls tender their services, and heavenly\r\nangels promulgate and spread it broadcast. If it is considered with\r\ninsight, it will be seen that all the forces of the universe, in the last\r\nanalysis serve the Covenant. In the future it shall be made evident and\r\nmanifest. In view of this fact, what can these weak and feeble souls\r\nachieve? Hardy plants that are destitute of roots and are deprived of the\r\noutpourings of the cloud of mercy will not last. What then may be expected\r\nfrom feeble weeds?...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n193: IT IS DAYBREAK, AND FROM THE RISING-POINT OF THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is daybreak, and from the rising-point of the invisible realms of God,\r\nthe light of unity is dawning; and streaming and beating down from the\r\nhidden world of the Kingdom of oneness there cometh a flood of abounding\r\ngrace. Glad tidings of the Kingdom are sounding from every side, and\r\nwafting in from every direction are the first morning signs of the\r\nexalting of God's Word and the upraising of His Cause. The word of unity\r\nis spreading, the verses of oneness are being sung, the sea of God's\r\nbestowals is tossing high its waves, and in plunging cataracts His\r\nblessings are pouring down.\r\n\r\nThe confirmations of Him Who is the Ever-Forgiving have wrapped every\r\nclime in light, the armies of the Company on high are rushing forward to\r\ndo battle at the side of the friends of the Lord and carry the day, the\r\nfame of the Ancient Beauty--may my life be offered up for His loved\r\nones--resoundeth from pole to pole and word of the Holy Cause hath spread\r\nto east and west.\r\n\r\nAll these things bring joy to the heart, and yet 'Abdu'l-Baha is sunk deep\r\nin an ocean of grief, and pain and anguish have so affected my limbs and\r\nmembers that utter weakness hath overtaken my whole body. Note ye that\r\nwhen, singly and alone, with none to second me, I upraised the call of God\r\naround the world, the peoples thereof rose up to oppose, to dispute, to\r\ndeny. On one side, it is clear how the religionists of the past have\r\nmounted their attack at all points; again, there cometh word of the lying\r\nmockers and the extreme limits to which they are going to pull out the\r\nDivine Tree by the roots. What malicious and slanderous charges they bring\r\nagainst the Ancient Beauty, what pamphlets filled with wicked and depraved\r\nallegations they are busily writing and spreading against the Most Great\r\nName! And now, in deepest secrecy, they are straining every nerve to deal\r\nthis Faith a fearsome blow.\r\n\r\nAgain have the prideful devised all manner of plots and schemes to\r\ncompletely disable the Cause of God and to erase the name of 'Abdu'l-Baha\r\nfrom the Book of Life.\r\n\r\nAnd now, added to all these tribulations, these miseries, these enemy\r\nattacks, there hath arisen a dust cloud of ill will amongst the believers\r\nthemselves. This in spite of the fact that the Cause of the Ancient Beauty\r\nis the very essence of love, the very channel of oneness, existing only\r\nthat all may become the waves of one sea, and bright stars of the same\r\nendless sky, and pearls within the shell of singleness, and gleaming\r\njewels quarried from the mines of unity; that they may become servants one\r\nto another, adore one another, bless one another, praise one another; that\r\neach one may loose his tongue and extol the rest without exception, each\r\none voice his gratitude to all the rest; that all should lift up their\r\neyes to the horizon of glory, and remember that they are linked to the\r\nHoly Threshold; that they should see nothing but good in one another, hear\r\nnothing but praise of one another, and speak no word of one another save\r\nonly to praise.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed certain ones who tread this way of righteousness, and God\r\nbe thanked, these are strengthened and supported by heavenly power in\r\nevery land. But others have not arisen as they ought to this gloried and\r\nexalted station, and this doth lay upon the heart of 'Abdu'l-Baha a heavy\r\nburden of grief, of inconceivable grief. For no tempest more perilous than\r\nthis could ever assail the Cause of God, nor could anything else so\r\ndiminish the influence of His Word.\r\n\r\nIt behoveth all the beloved of God to become as one, to gather together\r\nunder the protection of a single flag, to stand for a uniform body of\r\nopinion, to follow one and the same pathway, to hold fast to a single\r\nresolve. Let them forget their divergent theories and put aside their\r\nconflicting views since, God be praised, our purpose is one, our goal is\r\none. We are the servants of one Threshold, we all draw our nourishment\r\nfrom the same one Source, we all are gathered in the shade of the same\r\nhigh Tabernacle, we all are sheltered under the one celestial Tree.\r\n\r\nO beloved of the Lord! If any soul speak ill of an absent one, the only\r\nresult will clearly be this: he will dampen the zeal of the friends and\r\ntend to make them indifferent. For backbiting is divisive, it is the\r\nleading cause among the friends of a disposition to withdraw. If any\r\nindividual should speak ill of one who is absent, it is incumbent on his\r\nhearers, in a spiritual and friendly manner, to stop him, and say in\r\neffect: would this detraction serve any useful purpose? Would it please\r\nthe Blessed Beauty, contribute to the lasting honour of the friends,\r\npromote the holy Faith, support the Covenant, or be of any possible\r\nbenefit to any soul? No, never! On the contrary, it would make the dust to\r\nsettle so thickly on the heart that the ears would hear no more, and the\r\neyes would no longer behold the light of truth.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a person setteth about speaking well of another, opening his\r\nlips to praise another, he will touch an answering chord in his hearers\r\nand they will be stirred up by the breathings of God. Their hearts and\r\nsouls will rejoice to know that, God be thanked, here is a soul in the\r\nFaith who is a focus of human perfections, a very embodiment of the\r\nbounties of the Lord, one whose tongue is eloquent, and whose face\r\nshineth, in whatever gathering he may be, one who hath victory upon his\r\nbrow, and who is a being sustained by the sweet savours of God.\r\n\r\nNow which is the better way? I swear this by the beauty of the Lord:\r\nwhensoever I hear good of the friends, my heart filleth up with joy; but\r\nwhensoever I find even a hint that they are on bad terms one with another,\r\nI am overwhelmed by grief. Such is the condition of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Then\r\njudge from this where your duty lieth.\r\n\r\nGod be praised, wherever we turn, the Ancient Beauty hath opened wide the\r\ngates of grace, and hath in unmistakable words announced glad tidings of\r\nvictory through the Lord's sustaining help. Through love hath He carried\r\noff the hearts of the believers, and He hath entrusted their triumph to\r\nthe armies of the Concourse on high.\r\n\r\nNow amidst all the peoples of the world must the beloved arise, with a\r\nheart even as the day-star, a strong inward urge, a shining brow, a\r\nmusk-scented breath, a tongue speaking ever of God, an exposition\r\ncrystal-clear, a high resolve, a power born of heaven, a spiritual\r\ncharacter, a confirmation nothing short of the divine. Let them one and\r\nall become as a splendour on the horizon of heaven, and in the skies of\r\nthe world a dazzling star. Let them be fruitful trees in the celestial\r\nbowers, sweet-scented blooms in the divine gardens; let them be verses of\r\nperfection on the page of the universe, words of oneness in the Book of\r\nLife. This is the first age, and the early beginnings of the dispensation\r\nof the Most Great Light, wherefore, within this century, virtues must be\r\nacquired, goodly qualities must be perfected within this span of time. In\r\nthese very days the Abha Paradise must pitch its pavilions on the plains\r\nof the world. The lights of reality must now be revealed, and the secrets\r\nof God's bestowals must now be made known, and now must the olden grace\r\nshine forth and this world change into the pleasure-ground of heaven, the\r\ngarden of God. And out of pure hearts, and through heavenly bounties, all\r\nthe perfections, qualities and attributes of the divine must now be made\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\nAt all times doth 'Abdu'l-Baha supplicate and with tears entreat the\r\nAlmighty at the sacred Threshold, and crieth out:\r\n\r\nO Thou kind Lord! We are servants of Thy Threshold, taking shelter at Thy\r\nholy Door. We seek no refuge save only this strong pillar, turn nowhere\r\nfor a haven but unto Thy safekeeping. Protect us, bless us, support us,\r\nmake us such that we shall love but Thy good pleasure, utter only Thy\r\npraise, follow only the pathway of truth, that we may become rich enough\r\nto dispense with all save Thee, and receive our gifts from the sea of Thy\r\nbeneficence, that we may ever strive to exalt Thy Cause and to spread Thy\r\nsweet savours far and wide, that we may become oblivious of self and\r\noccupied only with Thee, and disown all else and be caught up in Thee.\r\n\r\nO Thou Provider, O Thou Forgiver! Grant us Thy grace and loving-kindness,\r\nThy gifts and Thy bestowals, and sustain us, that we may attain our goal.\r\nThou art the Powerful, the Able, the Knower, the Seer; and verily Thou art\r\nthe Generous, and verily Thou art the All-Merciful, and verily Thou art\r\nthe Ever-Forgiving, He to Whom repentance is due, He Who forgiveth even\r\nthe most grievous of sins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n194: O YE THE SINCERE LOVED ONES OF THE ABHA BEAUTY! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye the sincere loved ones of the Abha Beauty! In these days the Cause of\r\nGod, the world over, is fast growing in power and, day by day, is\r\nspreading further and further to the utmost bounds of the earth. Its\r\nenemies, therefore, from all the kindreds and peoples of the world, are\r\ngrowing aggressive, malevolent, envious and bitterly hostile. It is\r\nincumbent upon the loved ones of God to exercise the greatest care and\r\nprudence in all things, whether great or small, to take counsel together\r\nand unitedly resist the onslaught of the stirrers up of strife and the\r\nmovers of mischief. They must endeavour to consort in a friendly spirit\r\nwith everyone, must follow moderation in their conduct, must have respect\r\nand consideration one for another and show loving-kindness and tender\r\nregard to all the peoples of the world. They must be patient and\r\nlong-suffering, that they may grow to become the divine magnets of the\r\nAbha Kingdom and acquire the dynamic power of the hosts of the realm on\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nThe fleeting hours of man's life on earth pass swiftly by and the little\r\nthat still remaineth shall come to an end, but that which endureth and\r\nlasteth for evermore is the fruit that man reapeth from his servitude at\r\nthe Divine Threshold. Behold the truth of this saying, how abundant and\r\nglorious are the proofs thereof in the world of being!\r\n\r\nThe glory of glories rest upon the people of Baha!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n195: O THOU EXALTED BOUGH OF THE DIVINE LOTE-TREE! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou exalted bough of the divine Lote-Tree! ...When thou art disdained\r\nand rejected by the wicked doers be not cast down; and at the power and\r\nstiffneckedness of the presumptuous be neither vexed nor sick at heart;\r\nfor such is the way of heedless souls, from time out of mind. 'O the\r\nmisery of men! No Messenger cometh unto them but they laugh Him to\r\nscorn!'(59)\r\n\r\nIndeed, the attacks and the obstructiveness of the ignorant but cause the\r\nWord of God to be exalted, and spread His signs and tokens far and wide.\r\nWere it not for this opposition by the disdainful, this obduracy of the\r\nslanderers, this shouting from the pulpits, this crying and wailing of\r\ngreat and small alike, these accusations of unbelief levelled by the\r\nignorant, this uproar from the foolish--how could news of the advent of the\r\nPrimal Point and the bright dawning of the Day-Star of Baha ever have\r\nreached to east and west? How else could the planet have been rocked from\r\npole to pole? How else could Persia have become the focal point of\r\nscattering splendours, and Asia Minor the radiating heart of the beauty of\r\nthe Lord? However else could the flame of the Manifestation have spread\r\ninto the south? By what means could the cries of God have been heard in\r\nthe far north? How else could His summons have been heard in the\r\ncontinents of America and of Africa the dark? How else could the cock-crow\r\nof Heaven have penetrated those ears? How else could the sweet parrots of\r\nIndia have come upon this sugar, or nightingales have lifted up their\r\nwarblings out of the land of 'Iraq? What else could set the east and west\r\nto dancing, how else could this Consecrated Spot become the throne of the\r\nBeauty of God? How else could Sinai behold this burning brightness, how\r\ncould the Advent's flame adorn that mount? How else could the Holy Land be\r\nmade the footstool of God's beauty, and the holy vale of Towa(60) become\r\nthe site of excellence and grace, the sacred spot where Moses put off His\r\nshoes? How could the breaths of heaven be carried across the Vale of\r\nHoliness, how could the sweet-scented, airy streams that blow out of the\r\nAbha gardens ever be perceived by those that dwell on the Verdant Isle?\r\nHow else could the pledges of the Prophets, the joyous tidings of the holy\r\nSeers of old, the stirring promises given unto this Sacred Place by the\r\nManifestations of God, ever have been fulfilled?\r\n\r\nHow else could the Tree of Anisa have been planted here, the flag of the\r\nTestament be flown, the intoxicating cup of the Covenant be lifted to\r\nthese lips? All these blessings and bestowals, the very means of\r\nproclaiming the Faith, have come about through the scorn of the ignorant,\r\nthe opposition of the foolish, the stubbornness of the dull-witted, the\r\nviolence of the aggressor. Had it not been for these things, the news of\r\nthe Bab's advent would not, to this day, have reached even into lands hard\r\nby. Wherefore we should never grieve over the blindness of the unwitting,\r\nthe attacks of the foolish, the hostility of the low and base, the\r\nheedlessness of the divines, the charges of infidelity brought against us\r\nby the empty of mind. Such too was their way in ages past, nor would it be\r\nthus if they were of those who know; but they are benighted, and they come\r\nnot close to understanding what is told them.(61)\r\n\r\nWherefore doth it befit thyself, an offshoot of the Holy Tree of God,\r\nbranched out from that mighty Trunk--and it behoveth ourselves as well--so\r\nto burn, through the sustaining grace of the Ancient Beauty--may my life be\r\noffered up for His Most Holy Shrine--with this kindled flame out of heaven,\r\nthat we will light the fire of God's love from pole to pole. Let us take\r\nfor our example the great and sacred Tree of the exalted Bab--may my life\r\nbe offered up for Him. Like Him let us bare our breasts to the shafts of\r\nagony, like Him make our hearts to be targets for the spears decreed by\r\nGod. Let us, like candles, burn away; as moths, let us scorch our wings;\r\nas the field larks, vent our plaintive cries; as the nightingales, burst\r\nforth in lamentations.\r\n\r\nEven as the clouds let us shed down tears, and as the lightning flashes\r\nlet us laugh at our coursings through east and west. By day, by night, let\r\nus think but of spreading the sweet savours of God. Let us not keep on\r\nforever with our fancies and illusions, with our analysing and\r\ninterpreting and circulating of complex dubieties. Let us put aside all\r\nthoughts of self; let us close our eyes to all on earth, let us neither\r\nmake known our sufferings nor complain of our wrongs. Rather let us become\r\noblivious of our own selves, and drinking down the wine of heavenly grace,\r\nlet us cry out our joy, and lose ourselves in the beauty of the\r\nAll-Glorious.\r\n\r\nO thou Afnan of the divine Lote-Tree! We must strive, each one of us, to\r\nbecome as fecund boughs and to yield an ever sweeter and more wholesome\r\nfruit, that the branch may prove itself to be a continuation of the root,\r\nand the part be in harmony with the whole. It is my hope that out of the\r\nbounty of the Greatest Name and the loving-kindness of the Primal\r\nPoint--may my soul be offered up for Them both--we shall become the means of\r\nexalting the Word of God around the world; that we may ever render\r\nservices unto the Source of our Cause and spread over all the canopy of\r\nthe true and holy zeal of the Lord. That from over the fields of grace, we\r\nmay make zephyrs to blow, bringing to man the sweet scents that come from\r\nthe gardens of God. That we may make of this world the Abha Paradise, and\r\nchange this nether place into the Kingdom of Heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is true that every one of God's servants, and in particular those who\r\nare on fire with the Faith, have been allotted this task of servitude to\r\nAlmighty God; still, the duty imposed upon us is greater than that which\r\nhath been laid upon the rest. To Him do we look for grace and favour and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nAll praise and thanksgiving be unto the Blessed Beauty, for calling into\r\naction the armies of His Abha Kingdom, and sending forth to us His\r\nnever-interrupted aid, dependable as the rising stars. In every region of\r\nthe earth hath He supported this single, lonely servant, at every moment\r\nhath He made known to me the signs and tokens of His love. He hath cast\r\ninto a stupor all those who are clinging to their vain illusions, and made\r\nthem infamous in the sight of high and low. He hath caused those who run\r\nafter their fads and fancies to become objects of general reproach, and\r\nhath exposed the arrogant to public view; He hath made those of the\r\nfriends who proved infirm of faith to serve as a warning to every\r\nbeholder, and hath caused the leaders of those who waver to love but\r\nthemselves and sink down in self-conceit. Meanwhile, by the power of His\r\nmight, He hath made this broken-winged bird to rise up before all who\r\ndwell on earth. He hath shattered the serried ranks of the rebellious, and\r\nhath given the victory to the hosts of salvation, and breathed into the\r\nhearts of those who stand firm in the Covenant and Testament the breath of\r\neverlasting life.\r\n\r\nConvey thou the greetings of Abha to each one of the Afnan, branched from\r\nthe Holy Tree. The glory rest upon thee and upon all the Afnan who remain\r\nfaithful and true to the Covenant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n196: O THOU WHO ART STEADFAST IN THE COVENANT! THY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art steadfast in the Covenant! Thy letter of 9 September 1909\r\nhath been received. Be thou neither grieved nor despondent over what hath\r\ncome to pass. This trouble overtook thee as thou didst walk the path of\r\nGod, wherefore it should bring thee joy. We addressed the friends in\r\nwriting ere this, and made a verbal statement as well, to the effect that\r\nthe friends in the West will unquestionably have their share of the\r\ncalamities befalling the friends in the East. It is inevitable that,\r\nwalking the pathway of Baha'u'llah, they too will become targets for\r\npersecution by the oppressors.\r\n\r\nConsider how at the beginning of the Christian era the Apostles were\r\nafflicted, and what torments they endured in the pathway of Christ. Every\r\nday of their lives they were targets for the Pharisees' darts of mockery,\r\nvilification and abuse. They bore great hardship; they saw prison; and\r\nmost of them carried to their lips the sweet cup of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nNow ye, as well, must certainly become my partners to some slight degree,\r\nand accept your share of tests and sorrows. But these episodes shall pass\r\naway, while that abiding glory and eternal life shall remain unchanged\r\nforever. Moreover, these afflictions shall be the cause of great\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nI ask of God that thou, His husbandman, shalt plough the hard and stony\r\nground, and water it, and scatter seeds therein--for this will show how\r\nskilful is the farmer, while any man can sow and till where the ground is\r\nsoft, and clear of brambles and thorns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n197: O THOU SERVANT OF GOD! DO NOT GRIEVE AT THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou servant of God! Do not grieve at the afflictions and calamities\r\nthat have befallen thee. All calamities and afflictions have been created\r\nfor man so that he may spurn this mortal world--a world to which he is much\r\nattached. When he experienceth severe trials and hardships, then his\r\nnature will recoil and he will desire the eternal realm--a realm which is\r\nsanctified from all afflictions and calamities. Such is the case with the\r\nman who is wise. He shall never drink from a cup which is at the end\r\ndistasteful, but, on the contrary, he will seek the cup of pure and limpid\r\nwater. He will not taste of the honey that is mixed with poison.\r\n\r\nPraise thou God, that thou hast been tried and hast experienced such a\r\ntest. Be patient and grateful. Turn thy face to the divine Kingdom and\r\nstrive that thou mayest acquire merciful characteristics, mayest become\r\nillumined and acquire the attributes of the Kingdom and of the Lord.\r\nEndeavour to become indifferent to the pleasures of this world and to its\r\ncomfort, to remain firm and steadfast in the Covenant and to promulgate\r\nthe Cause of God.\r\n\r\nThis is the cause of the exaltation of man, the cause of his glory and of\r\nhis salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n198: O THOU WHO ART ENAMOURED OF THE BREATHS OF GOD! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art enamoured of the breaths of God! I have read thy letter,\r\nwhich cried out with thy love for God and thine irresistible attraction to\r\nHis Beauty, and its wondrous theme did cheer my heart.\r\n\r\nThe intent of what I wrote to thee in my previous letter was this, that\r\nwhen exalting the Word of God, there are trials to be met with, and\r\ncalamities; and that in loving Him, at every moment there are hardships,\r\ntorments, afflictions.\r\n\r\nIt behoveth the individual first to value these ordeals, willingly accept\r\nthem, and eagerly welcome them; only then should he proceed with teaching\r\nthe Faith and exalting the Word of God.\r\n\r\nIn such a state, no matter what may befall him in his love for\r\nGod--harassment, reproach, vilification, curses, beatings, imprisonment,\r\ndeath--he will never be cast down, and his passion for the Divine Beauty\r\nwill but gain in strength. This was what I meant.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, woe and misery to the soul that seeketh after comforts, riches,\r\nand earthly delights while neglecting to call God to mind! Because\r\ncalamities encountered in God's pathway are, to 'Abdu'l-Baha, but favour\r\nand grace, and in one of His Tablets the all-glorious Beauty hath\r\ndeclared: 'I never passed a tree but Mine heart addressed it saying: \"O\r\nwould that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon\r\nthee!\"' These were the words of the Most Great Name. This is His path.\r\nThis is the way to His Realm of Might.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n199: O YE SINCERE ONES, YE LONGING ONES, YE WHO ARE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye sincere ones, ye longing ones, ye who are drawn as if magnetized, ye\r\nwho have risen up to serve the Cause of God, to exalt His Word and scatter\r\nHis sweet savours far and wide! I have read your excellent letter,\r\nbeautiful as to style, eloquent as to words, profound as to meaning, and I\r\npraised God and thanked Him for having come to your aid and enabled you to\r\nserve Him in His widespreading vineyard.\r\n\r\nErelong shall your faces be bright with the radiance of your supplications\r\nand your worship of God, your prayers unto Him, and your humility and\r\nselflessness in the presence of the friends. He will make of your\r\nassemblage a magnet that will draw unto you the bright rays of divine\r\nconfirmations that shine out from His kingdom of glory.\r\n\r\nIt is incumbent upon you to ponder in your hearts and meditate upon His\r\nwords, and humbly to call upon Him, and to put away self in His heavenly\r\nCause. These are the things that will make of you signs of guidance unto\r\nall mankind, and brilliant stars shining down from the all-highest\r\nhorizon, and towering trees in the Abha Paradise.\r\n\r\nKnow ye that 'Abdu'l-Baha dwelleth in continual delight. To have been\r\nlodged in this faraway prison is for me exceeding joy. By the life of\r\nBaha! This prison is my supernal paradise; it is my cherished goal, the\r\ncomfort of my bosom, the bliss of my heart; it is my refuge, my shelter,\r\nmy asylum, my safe haven, and within it do I exult amid the hosts of\r\nheaven and the Company on high.\r\n\r\nRejoice in my bondage, O ye friends of God, for it soweth the seeds of\r\nfreedom; rejoice at my imprisonment, for it is the well-spring of\r\nsalvation; be ye glad on account of my travail, for it leadeth to eternal\r\nease. By the Lord God! I would not exchange this prison for the throne of\r\nthe whole world, nor give up this confinement for pleasures and pastimes\r\nin all the fair gardens on earth. My hope is that out of the Lord's\r\nabundant grace, His munificence and loving-kindness, I may, in His\r\npathway, be hanged against the sky, that my heart may become the target\r\nfor a thousand bullets, or that I may be cast into the depths of the sea,\r\nor be left to perish on desert sands. This is what I long for most; this\r\nis my supreme desire; it refresheth my soul, it is balm for my breast, it\r\nis the very solace of mine eyes.\r\n\r\nAs for you, O ye lovers of God, make firm your steps in His Cause, with\r\nsuch resolve that ye shall not be shaken though the direst of calamities\r\nassail the world. By nothing, under no conditions, be ye perturbed. Be ye\r\nanchored fast as the high mountains, be stars that dawn over the horizon\r\nof life, be bright lamps in the gatherings of unity, be souls humble and\r\nlowly in the presence of the friends, be innocent in heart. Be ye symbols\r\nof guidance and lights of godliness, severed from the world, clinging to\r\nthe handhold that is sure and strong, spreading abroad the spirit of life,\r\nriding the Ark of salvation. Be ye daysprings of generosity,\r\ndawning-points of the mysteries of existence, sites where inspiration\r\nalighteth, rising-places of splendours, souls that are sustained by the\r\nHoly Spirit, enamoured of the Lord, detached from all save Him, holy above\r\nthe characteristics of humankind, clothed in the attributes of the angels\r\nof heaven, that ye may win for yourselves the highest bestowal of all, in\r\nthis new time, this wondrous age.\r\n\r\nBy the life of Baha! Only he who is severed from the world shall achieve\r\nthis ultimate grace, he who is a captive of divine love, empty of passion\r\nand self, from every aspect true unto his God, humble, lowly,\r\nsupplicating, in tears, submissive in the presence of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n200: O MY SPIRITUAL LOVED ONES! AT A TIME WHEN AN ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO my spiritual loved ones! At a time when an ocean of trials and\r\ntribulations was surging up and flinging its waves to the heavens, when\r\nmultitudes were assailing us and the tyrannical were inflicting upon us\r\ncrushing wrongs--at such a time a band of individuals, intent on defaming\r\nus, allied themselves with our unkind brother, brought out a treatise that\r\nwas filled with slanderous charges, and levelled accusations and calumnies\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\nIn this way they alarmed and confused the government authorities, and it\r\nis obvious what the condition of this captive then became, in this\r\ndilapidated fortress, and what terrible harm and mischief was done, far\r\nworse than words can tell. In spite of everything, this homeless prisoner\r\nremained inwardly tranquil and secure, trusting in the peerless Lord,\r\nyearning for whatever afflictions might have to be encountered in the\r\npathway of God's love. For bolts of hate are, in our sight, but a gift of\r\npearls from Him, and mortal poison but a healing draught.\r\n\r\nSuch was our state when a letter came to us from the American friends.(62)\r\nThey had covenanted together, so they wrote, to remain at one in all\r\nthings, and the signatories one and all had pledged themselves to make\r\nsacrifices in the pathway of the love of God, thus to achieve eternal\r\nlife. At the very moment when this letter was read, together with the\r\nsignatures at its close, 'Abdu'l-Baha experienced a joy so vehement that\r\nno pen can describe it, and thanked God that friends have been raised up\r\nin that country who will live together in perfect harmony, in the best of\r\nfellowship, in full agreement, closely knit, united in their efforts.\r\n\r\nThe more this compact is reinforced, the happier and the better shall all\r\nthings be, for it will draw unto itself the confirmations of God. If the\r\nlovers of the Lord are hoping for grace to win as their friends the\r\nCompany on high, they must do all they can to strengthen this compact, for\r\nsuch an alliance for brotherhood and unity is even as watering the Tree of\r\nLife: it is life everlasting.\r\n\r\nO ye lovers of God! Make firm your steps; fulfil your pledge to one\r\nanother; go forth in harmony to scatter abroad the sweet savours of God's\r\nlove, and to establish His Teachings, until ye breathe a soul into the\r\ndead body of this world, and bring true healing in the physical and\r\nspiritual realms to everyone who aileth.\r\n\r\nO ye lovers of God! The world is even as a human being who is diseased and\r\nimpotent, whose eyes can see no longer, whose ears have gone deaf, all of\r\nwhose powers are corroded and used up. Wherefore must the friends of God\r\nbe competent physicians who, following the holy Teachings, will nurse this\r\npatient back to health. Perhaps, God willing, the world will mend, and\r\nbecome permanently whole, and its exhausted faculties will be restored,\r\nand its person will take on such vigour, freshness and verdancy that it\r\nwill shine out with comeliness and grace.\r\n\r\nThe first remedy of all is to guide the people aright, so that they will\r\nturn themselves unto God, and listen to His counsellings, and go forth\r\nwith hearing ears and seeing eyes. Once this speedily effective draught is\r\ngiven them, then, in accordance with the Teachings, they must be led to\r\nacquire the characteristics and the behaviour of the Concourse on high,\r\nand encouraged to seek out all the bounties of the Abha Realm. They must\r\ncleanse their hearts from even the slightest trace of hatred and spite,\r\nand they must set about being truthful and honest, conciliatory and loving\r\nto all humankind--so that East and West will, even as two lovers, hold each\r\nother close; that hatred and hostility will perish from the earth, and\r\nuniversal peace be firmly rooted in their place.\r\n\r\nO ye lovers of God! Be kind to all peoples; care for every person; do all\r\nye can to purify the hearts and minds of men; strive ye to gladden every\r\nsoul. To every meadow be a shower of grace, to every tree the water of\r\nlife; be as sweet musk to the sense of humankind, and to the ailing be a\r\nfresh, restoring breeze. Be pleasing waters to all those who thirst, a\r\ncareful guide to all who have lost their way; be father and mother to the\r\norphan, be loving sons and daughters to the old, be an abundant treasure\r\nto the poor. Think ye of love and good fellowship as the delights of\r\nheaven, think ye of hostility and hatred as the torments of hell.\r\n\r\nIndulge not your bodies with rest, but work with all your souls, and with\r\nall your hearts cry out and beg of God to grant you His succour and grace.\r\nThus may ye make this world the Abha Paradise, and this globe of earth the\r\nparade ground of the realm on high. If only ye exert the effort, it is\r\ncertain that these splendours will shine out, these clouds of mercy will\r\nshed down their rain, these life-giving winds will rise and blow, this\r\nsweet-smelling musk will be scattered far and wide.\r\n\r\nO ye lovers of God! Do not dwell on what is coming to pass in this holy\r\nplace, and be ye in no wise alarmed. Whatsoever may happen is for the\r\nbest, because affliction is but the essence of bounty, and sorrow and toil\r\nare mercy unalloyed, and anguish is peace of mind, and to make a sacrifice\r\nis to receive a gift, and whatsoever may come to pass hath issued from\r\nGod's grace.\r\n\r\nSee ye, therefore, to your own tasks: guide ye the people and educate them\r\nin the ways of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Deliver to mankind this joyous message from\r\nthe Abha Realm. Rest not, by day or night; seek ye no moment's peace.\r\nStrive ye with all your might to bring to men's ears these happy tidings.\r\nIn your love for God and your attachment to 'Abdu'l-Baha, accept ye every\r\ntribulation, every sorrow. Endure the aggressor's taunts, put up with the\r\nenemy's reproaches. Follow in the footsteps of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and in the\r\npathway of the Abha Beauty, long at every moment to give up your lives.\r\nShine out like the day-star, be unresting as the sea; even as the clouds\r\nof heaven, shed ye life upon field and hill, and like unto April winds,\r\nblow freshness through those human trees, and bring them to their\r\nblossoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n201: O THOU WHO ART CARRIED AWAY BY THE LOVE OF GOD! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art carried away by the love of God! The Sun of Truth hath\r\nrisen above the horizon of this world and cast down its beams of guidance.\r\nEternal grace is never interrupted, and a fruit of that everlasting grace\r\nis universal peace. Rest thou assured that in this era of the spirit, the\r\nKingdom of Peace will raise up its tabernacle on the summits of the world,\r\nand the commandments of the Prince of Peace will so dominate the arteries\r\nand nerves of every people as to draw into His sheltering shade all the\r\nnations on earth. From springs of love and truth and unity will the true\r\nShepherd give His sheep to drink.\r\n\r\nO handmaid of God, peace must first be established among individuals,\r\nuntil it leadeth in the end to peace among nations. Wherefore, O ye\r\nBaha'is, strive ye with all your might to create, through the power of the\r\nWord of God, genuine love, spiritual communion and durable bonds among\r\nindividuals. This is your task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n202: O YE LOVERS OF TRUTH, YE SERVANTS OF HUMANKIND! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye lovers of truth, ye servants of humankind! Out of the flowering of\r\nyour thoughts and hopes, fragrant emanations have come my way, wherefore\r\nan inner sense of obligation compelleth me to pen these words.\r\n\r\nYe observe how the world is divided against itself, how many a land is red\r\nwith blood and its very dust is caked with human gore. The fires of\r\nconflict have blazed so high that never in early times, not in the Middle\r\nAges, not in recent centuries hath there ever been such a hideous war, a\r\nwar that is even as millstones, taking for grain the skulls of men. Nay,\r\neven worse, for flourishing countries have been reduced to rubble, cities\r\nhave been levelled with the ground, and many a once prosperous village\r\nhath been turned into ruin. Fathers have lost their sons, and sons their\r\nfathers. Mothers have wept away their hearts over dead children. Children\r\nhave been orphaned, women left to wander, vagrants without a home. From\r\nevery aspect, humankind hath sunken low. Loud are the piercing cries of\r\nfatherless children; loud the mothers' anguished voices, reaching to the\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nAnd the breeding-ground of all these tragedies is prejudice: prejudice of\r\nrace and nation, of religion, of political opinion; and the root cause of\r\nprejudice is blind imitation of the past--imitation in religion, in racial\r\nattitudes, in national bias, in politics. So long as this aping of the\r\npast persisteth, just so long will the foundations of the social order be\r\nblown to the four winds, just so long will humanity be continually exposed\r\nto direst peril.\r\n\r\nNow, in such an illumined age as ours, when realities previously unknown\r\nto man have been laid bare, and the secrets of created things have been\r\ndisclosed, and the Morn of Truth hath broken and lit up the world--is it\r\nadmissible that men should be waging a frightful war that is bringing\r\nhumanity down to ruin? No, by the Lord God!\r\n\r\nChrist Jesus summoned all mankind to amity and peace. Unto Peter He said:\r\n'Put up thy sword into the sheath.'(63) Such was the bidding and counsel\r\nof the Lord Christ; and yet today the Christians one and all have drawn\r\ntheir swords from out the scabbard. How wide is the discrepancy between\r\nsuch acts and the clear Gospel text!\r\n\r\nSixty years ago Baha'u'llah rose up, even as the Day-Star, over Persia. He\r\ndeclared that the skies of the world were dark, that this darkness boded\r\nevil, and that terrible wars would come. From the prison at Akka, He\r\naddressed the German Emperor in the clearest of terms, telling him that a\r\ngreat war was on the way and that his city of Berlin would break forth in\r\nlamentation and wailing. Likewise did He write to the Turkish sovereign,\r\nalthough He was that Sultan's victim and a captive in his prison--that is,\r\nHe was being held prisoner in the Fortress at Akka--and clearly stated that\r\nConstantinople would be overtaken by a sudden and radical change, so great\r\nthat the women and children of that city would mourn and cry aloud. In\r\nbrief, He addressed such words to all the monarchs and the presidents, and\r\neverything came to pass, exactly as He had foretold.\r\n\r\nThere have issued, from His mighty Pen, various teachings for the\r\nprevention of war, and these have been scattered far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe first is the independent investigation of truth; for blind imitation\r\nof the past will stunt the mind. But once every soul inquireth into truth,\r\nsociety will be freed from the darkness of continually repeating the past.\r\n\r\nHis second principle is the oneness of mankind: that all men are the sheep\r\nof God, and God is their loving Shepherd, caring most tenderly for all\r\nwithout favouring one or another. 'No difference canst thou see in the\r\ncreation of the God of mercy';(64) all are His servants, all implore His\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nHis third teaching is that religion is a mighty stronghold, but that it\r\nmust engender love, not malevolence and hate. Should it lead to malice,\r\nspite, and hate, it is of no value at all. For religion is a remedy, and\r\nif the remedy bring on disease, then put it aside. Again, as to religious,\r\nracial, national and political bias: all these prejudices strike at the\r\nvery root of human life; one and all they beget bloodshed, and the\r\nruination of the world. So long as these prejudices survive, there will be\r\ncontinuous and fearsome wars.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this condition there must be universal peace. To bring this\r\nabout, a Supreme Tribunal must be established, representative of all\r\ngovernments and peoples; questions both national and international must be\r\nreferred thereto, and all must carry out the decrees of this Tribunal.\r\nShould any government or people disobey, let the whole world arise against\r\nthat government or people.\r\n\r\nYet another of the teachings of Baha'u'llah is the equality of men and\r\nwomen and their equal sharing in all rights. And there are many similar\r\nprinciples. It hath now become evident that these teachings are the very\r\nlife and soul of the world.\r\n\r\nYe who are servants of the human race, strive ye with all your heart to\r\ndeliver mankind out of this darkness and these prejudices that belong to\r\nthe human condition and the world of nature, so that humanity may find its\r\nway into the light of the world of God.\r\n\r\nPraise be to Him, ye are acquainted with the various laws, institutions\r\nand principles of the world; today nothing short of these divine teachings\r\ncan assure peace and tranquillity to mankind. But for these teachings,\r\nthis darkness shall never vanish, these chronic diseases shall never be\r\nhealed; nay, they shall grow fiercer from day to day. The Balkans will\r\nremain discontented. Its restlessness will increase. The vanquished Powers\r\nwill continue to agitate. They will resort to every measure that may\r\nrekindle the flame of war. Movements, newly-born and world-wide in their\r\nrange, will exert their utmost effort for the advancement of their\r\ndesigns. The Movement of the Left will acquire great importance. Its\r\ninfluence will spread.\r\n\r\nStrive ye, therefore, with the help of God, with illumined minds and\r\nhearts and a strength born of heaven, to become a bestowal from God to\r\nman, and to call into being for all humankind, comfort and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n203: O THOU WHO ART ENAMOURED OF THE COVENANT! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art enamoured of the Covenant! The Blessed Beauty hath promised\r\nthis servant that souls would be raised up who would be the very\r\nembodiments of guidance, and banners of the Concourse on high, torches of\r\nGod's oneness, and stars of His pure truth, shining in the heavens where\r\nGod reigneth alone. They would give sight to the blind, and would make the\r\ndeaf to hear; they would raise the dead to life. They would confront all\r\nthe peoples of the earth, pleading their Cause with proofs of the Lord of\r\nthe seven spheres.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that in His bounty He will soon raise up these souls, that\r\nHis Cause may be exalted. The lodestone which will attract this grace is\r\nstaunchness in the Covenant. Render thou thanks unto God that thou art\r\nfirmest of the firm.\r\n\r\nO my God, aid Thou Thy servant to raise up the Word, and to refute what is\r\nvain and false, to establish the truth, to spread the sacred verses\r\nabroad, reveal the splendours, and make the morning's light to dawn in the\r\nhearts of the righteous.\r\n\r\nThou art verily the Generous, the Forgiving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n204: O PHOENIX OF THAT IMMORTAL FLAME KINDLED IN THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO phoenix of that immortal flame kindled in the sacred Tree!\r\nBaha'u'llah--may my life, my soul, my spirit be offered up as a sacrifice\r\nunto His lowly servants--hath, during His last days on earth, given the\r\nmost emphatic promise that, through the outpourings of the grace of God\r\nand the aid and assistance vouchsafed from His Kingdom on high, souls will\r\narise and holy beings appear who, as stars, would adorn the firmament of\r\ndivine guidance; illumine the dayspring of loving-kindness and bounty;\r\nmanifest the signs of the unity of God; shine with the light of sanctity\r\nand purity; receive their full measure of divine inspiration; raise high\r\nthe sacred torch of faith; stand firm as the rock and immoveable as the\r\nmountain; and grow to become luminaries in the heavens of His Revelation,\r\nmighty channels of His grace, means for the bestowal of God's bountiful\r\ncare, heralds calling forth the name of the One true God, and establishers\r\nof the world's supreme foundation.\r\n\r\nThese shall labour ceaselessly, by day and by night, shall heed neither\r\ntrials nor woe, shall suffer no respite in their efforts, shall seek no\r\nrepose, shall disregard all ease and comfort, and, detached and unsullied,\r\nshall consecrate every fleeting moment of their lives to the diffusion of\r\nthe divine fragrance and the exaltation of God's holy Word. Their faces\r\nwill radiate heavenly gladness, and their hearts be filled with joy. Their\r\nsouls will be inspired, and their foundation stand secure. They shall\r\nscatter in the world, and travel throughout all regions. They shall raise\r\ntheir voices in every assembly, and adorn and revive every gathering. They\r\nshall speak in every tongue, and interpret every hidden meaning. They\r\nshall reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom, and manifest unto everyone the\r\nsigns of God. They shall burn brightly even as a candle in the heart of\r\nevery assembly, and beam forth as a star upon every horizon. The gentle\r\nbreezes wafted from the garden of their hearts shall perfume and revive\r\nthe souls of men, and the revelations of their minds, even as showers,\r\nwill reinvigorate the peoples and nations of the world.\r\n\r\nI am waiting, eagerly waiting for these holy ones to appear; and yet, how\r\nlong will they delay their coming? My prayer and ardent supplication, at\r\neventide and at dawn, is that these shining stars may soon shed their\r\nradiance upon the world, that their sacred countenances may be unveiled to\r\nmortal eyes, that the hosts of divine assistance may achieve their\r\nvictory, and the billows of grace, rising from His oceans above, may flow\r\nupon all mankind. Pray ye also and supplicate unto Him that through the\r\nbountiful aid of the Ancient Beauty these souls may be unveiled to the\r\neyes of the world.\r\n\r\nThe glory of God rest upon thee, and upon him whose face is illumined with\r\nthat everlasting light that shineth from His Kingdom of Glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n205: O YE RESPECTED SOULS! FROM THE CONTINUAL IMITATION ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye respected souls! From the continual imitation of ancient and worn-out\r\nways, the world had grown dark as darksome night. The fundamentals of the\r\ndivine Teachings had passed from memory; their pith and heart had been\r\ntotally forgotten, and the people were holding on to husks. The nations\r\nhad, like tattered garments long outworn, fallen into a pitiful condition.\r\n\r\nOut of this pitch blackness there dawned the morning splendour of the\r\nTeachings of Baha'u'llah. He hath dressed the world with a garment new and\r\nfair, and that new garment is the principles which have come down from\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nNow the new age is here and creation is reborn. Humanity hath taken on new\r\nlife. The autumn hath gone by, and the reviving spring is here. All things\r\nare now made new. Arts and industries have been reborn, there are new\r\ndiscoveries in science, and there are new inventions; even the details of\r\nhuman affairs, such as dress and personal effects--even weapons--all these\r\nhave likewise been renewed. The laws and procedures of every government\r\nhave been revised. Renewal is the order of the day.\r\n\r\nAnd all this newness hath its source in the fresh outpourings of wondrous\r\ngrace and favour from the Lord of the Kingdom, which have renewed the\r\nworld. The people, therefore, must be set completely free from their old\r\npatterns of thought, that all their attention may be focused upon these\r\nnew principles, for these are the light of this time and the very spirit\r\nof this age.\r\n\r\nUnless these Teachings are effectively spread among the people, until the\r\nold ways, the old concepts, are gone and forgotten, this world of being\r\nwill find no peace, nor will it reflect the perfections of the Heavenly\r\nKingdom. Strive ye with all your hearts to make the heedless conscious, to\r\nwaken those who sleep, to bring knowledge to the ignorant, to make the\r\nblind to see, the deaf to hear, and restore the dead to life.\r\n\r\nIt behoveth you to show forth such power, such endurance, as to astonish\r\nall beholders. The confirmations of the Kingdom are with you. Upon you be\r\nthe glory of the All-Glorious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n206: PRAISE BE TO HIM WHO HATH RENT THE DARK ASUNDER, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise be to Him Who hath rent the dark asunder, hath blotted out the\r\nnight, hath drawn aside the coverings and torn away the veils; Whose light\r\nthereupon shone out, Whose signs and tokens were spread abroad, and His\r\nmysteries laid bare. Then did His clouds part and loaded down the earth\r\nwith His bounties and bestowals, and made all things sweet with rain, and\r\ncaused the fresh greenery of knowledge and the hyacinths of certitude to\r\nspring forth and to shake and tremble for joy, till the whole world was\r\nscented with the fragrance of His holiness.\r\n\r\nSalutations and praise, blessings and glory be upon those divine\r\nrealities, those sacred windflowers that have come forth out of this\r\nsupreme bestowal, this flooding grace that hath roared like a clashing sea\r\nof gifts and bounties, tossing its waves to the high heavens.\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for kindling the fire of divine love in\r\nthe Holy Tree on the summit of the loftiest mount: that Tree which is\r\n'neither of the east nor of the west,'(65) that fire which blazed out till\r\nthe flame of it soared upward to the Concourse on high, and from it those\r\nrealities caught the light of guidance, and cried out: 'Verily have we\r\nperceived a fire on the slope of Mount Sinai.'(66)\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Increase Thou this fire, as day followeth day, till the\r\nblast of it setteth in motion all the earth. O Thou, my Lord! Kindle the\r\nlight of Thy love in every heart, breathe into men's souls the spirit of\r\nThy knowledge, gladden their breasts with the verses of Thy oneness. Call\r\nThou to life those who dwell in their tombs, warn Thou the prideful, make\r\nhappiness world-wide, send down Thy crystal waters, and in the assemblage\r\nof manifest splendours, pass round that cup which is 'tempered at the\r\ncamphor fountain.'(67)\r\n\r\nVerily art Thou the Giving, the Forgiving, the Ever-Bestowing. Verily art\r\nThou the Merciful, the Compassionate.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! The wine-cup of Heaven overfloweth, the banquet of\r\nGod's Covenant is bright with festive lights, the dawn of all bestowals is\r\nbreaking, the gentle winds of grace are blowing, and out of the invisible\r\nworld come good tidings of bounties and gifts. In flower-spangled meadows\r\nhath the divine springtime pitched its tents, and the spiritual are\r\ninhaling sweet scents from the Sheba of the spirit, carried their way by\r\nthe east wind. Now doth the mystic nightingale carol its odes, and buds of\r\ninner meaning are bursting into blossoms delicate and fair. The field\r\nlarks are become the festival's musicians, and lifting wondrous voices\r\nthey cry and sing to the melodies of the Company on high, 'Blessed are ye!\r\nGlad Tidings! Glad Tidings!' And they urge on the revellers of the Abha\r\nParadise to drink their fill, and they eloquently hold forth upon the\r\ncelestial tree, and utter their sacred cries. All this, that withered\r\nsouls who tread the desert of the heedless, and faded ones lost in the\r\nsands of unconcern, may come to throbbing life again, and present\r\nthemselves at the feasts and revels of the Lord God.\r\n\r\nPraise be to Him! The renown of His Cause hath reached to east and west,\r\nand word of the power of the Abha Beauty hath quickened north and south.\r\nThat cry from the American continent is a choir of holiness, that shout\r\nfrom far and near that riseth even to the Company on high is 'Ya\r\nBaha'u'l-Abha!' Now is the east lit up with a glory, and the west\r\nrose-sweet, and all the earth is fragrant with ambergris, and the winds\r\nthat blow over the Holy Shrine are laden with musk. Erelong shall ye see\r\nthat even the darkest lands are bright, and the continents of Europe and\r\nAfrica have turned into gardens of flowers, and forests of blossoming\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nBut since the dawning of this Day-Star was in Persia, and since from that\r\norient the sun shone upon the west, it is our fondest hope that the flames\r\nof love's fire should blaze ever more vehemently in that land, and that\r\nthere the splendour of this Holy Faith should grow ever more intense. May\r\nthe tumult of God's Cause so shake that land to its foundations, may the\r\nspiritual force of His Word so manifest itself, as to make Iran the core\r\nand focus of well-being and peace. May rectitude and conciliation, and\r\nlove and trust, issuing forth from Iran, bring immortality to all on\r\nearth. May she raise on the highest summits the banner of public order, of\r\npurest spirituality, of universal peace.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! In this, the Baha'i dispensation, God's Cause is\r\nspirit unalloyed. His Cause belongeth not to the material world. It cometh\r\nneither for strife nor war, nor for acts of mischief or of shame; it is\r\nneither for quarrelling with other Faiths, nor for conflicts with the\r\nnations. Its only army is the love of God, its only joy the clear wine of\r\nHis knowledge, its only battle the expounding of the Truth; its one\r\ncrusade is against the insistent self, the evil promptings of the human\r\nheart. Its victory is to submit and yield, and to be selfless is its\r\neverlasting glory. In brief, it is spirit upon spirit:\r\n\r\nUnless ye must,\r\n\r\nBruise not the serpent in the dust,\r\n\r\nHow much less wound a man.\r\n\r\nAnd if ye can,\r\n\r\nNo ant should ye alarm,\r\n\r\nMuch less a brother harm.\r\n\r\nLet all your striving be for this, to become the source of life and\r\nimmortality, and peace and comfort and joy, to every human soul, whether\r\none known to you or a stranger, one opposed to you or on your side. Look\r\nye not upon the purity or impurity of his nature: look ye upon the\r\nall-embracing mercy of the Lord, the light of Whose grace hath embosomed\r\nthe whole earth and all who dwell thereon, and in the plenitude of Whose\r\nbounty are immersed both the wise and the ignorant. Stranger and friend\r\nalike are seated at the table of His favour. Even as the believer, the\r\ndenier who turneth away from God doth at the same time cup his hands and\r\ndrink from the sea of His bestowals.\r\n\r\nIt behoveth the loved ones of the Lord to be the signs and tokens of His\r\nuniversal mercy and the embodiments of His own excelling grace. Like the\r\nsun, let them cast their rays upon garden and rubbish heap alike, and even\r\nas clouds in spring, let them shed down their rain upon flower and thorn.\r\nLet them seek but love and faithfulness, let them not follow the ways of\r\nunkindness, let their talk be confined to the secrets of friendship and of\r\npeace. Such are the attributes of the righteous, such is the\r\ndistinguishing mark of those who serve His Threshold.\r\n\r\nThe Abha Beauty endured the most afflictive of calamities. He bore\r\ncountless agonies and ills. He enjoyed not a moment's peace, drew not an\r\neaseful breath. He wandered, homeless, over desert sands and mountain\r\nslopes; He was shut in a fortress, and a prison cell. But to Him, His\r\npauper's mat of straw was an eternal throne of glory, and His heavy chains\r\na sovereign's carcanet. By day, by night, He lived under a whirring sword,\r\nand He was ready from moment to moment for death on the cross. He bore all\r\nthis that He might purify the world, and deck it out with the tender\r\nmercies of the Lord God; that He might set it at rest; that conflict and\r\naggression might be put to flight, the lance and the keen blade be\r\nexchanged for loving fellowship, malevolence and war turn into safety and\r\ngentleness and love, that battlefields of hate and wrath should become\r\ngardens of delight, and places where once the blood-drenched armies\r\nclashed, be fragrant pleasure grounds; that warfare should be seen as\r\nshame, and the resort to arms, even as a loathsome sickness, be shunned by\r\nevery people; that universal peace raise its pavilions on the loftiest\r\nmounts, and war be made to perish forever from the earth.\r\n\r\nWherefore must the loved ones of God, laboriously, with the waters of\r\ntheir striving, tend and nourish and foster this tree of hope. In\r\nwhatsoever land they dwell, let them with a whole heart befriend and be\r\ncompanions to those who are either close to them, or far removed. Let\r\nthem, with qualities like unto those of heaven, promote the institutions\r\nand the religion of God. Let them never lose heart, never be despondent,\r\nnever feel afflicted. The more antagonism they meet, the more let them\r\nshow their own good faith; the more torments and calamities they have to\r\nface, the more generously let them pass round the bounteous cup. Such is\r\nthe spirit which will become the life of the world, such is the spreading\r\nlight at its heart: and he who may be and do other than this is not worthy\r\nto serve at the Holy Threshold of the Lord.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! The Sun of Truth is shining down from invisible\r\nskies; know ye the value of these days. Lift up your heads, and grow ye\r\ncypress-tall in these swift-running streams. Take ye joy in the beauty of\r\nthe narcissus of Najd, for night will fall and it will be no more....\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! Praise be to Him, the bright banner of the\r\nCovenant is flying higher every day, while the flag of perfidy hath been\r\nreversed, and hangeth at half-mast. The benighted attackers have been\r\nshaken to their core; they are now as ruined sepulchres, and even as blind\r\ncreatures that dwell beneath the earth they creep and crawl about a corner\r\nof the tomb, and out of that hole, from time to time, like unto savage\r\nbeasts, do they jibber and howl. Glory be to God! How can the darkness\r\nhope to overcome the light, how can a magician's cords hold fast 'a\r\nserpent plain for all to see'? 'Then lo! It swallowed up their lying\r\nwonders.'(68) Alas for them! They have deluded themselves with a fable,\r\nand to indulge their appetites they have done away with their own selves.\r\nThey gave up everlasting glory in exchange for human pride, and they\r\nsacrificed greatness in both worlds to the demands of the insistent self.\r\nThis is that of which We have forewarned you. Erelong shall ye behold the\r\nfoolish in manifest loss.\r\n\r\nO my Lord and my Hope! Help Thou Thy loved ones to be steadfast in Thy\r\nmighty Covenant, to remain faithful to Thy manifest Cause, and to carry\r\nout the commandments Thou didst set down for them in Thy Book of\r\nSplendours; that they may become banners of guidance and lamps of the\r\nCompany above, wellsprings of Thine infinite wisdom, and stars that lead\r\naright, as they shine down from the supernal sky.\r\n\r\nVerily art Thou the Invincible, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n207: O YE WHO HAVE TURNED YOUR FACES TOWARD THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye who have turned your faces toward the Exalted Beauty! By night, by\r\nday, at morningtide and sunset, when darkness draweth on, and at early\r\nlight I remember, and ever have remembered, in the realms of my mind and\r\nheart, the loved ones of the Lord. I beg of Him to bestow His\r\nconfirmations upon those loved ones, dwellers in that pure and holy land,\r\nand to grant them successful outcomes in all things: that in their\r\ncharacter, their behaviour, their words, their way of life, in all they\r\nare and do, He will make them to achieve distinction among men; that He\r\nwill gather them into the world community, their hearts filled with\r\necstasy and fervour and yearning love, with knowledge and certitude, with\r\nsteadfastness and unity, their faces beauteous and bright.\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! This day is the day of union, the day of the\r\ningathering of all mankind. 'Verily God loveth those who, as though they\r\nwere a solid wall, do battle for His Cause in serried lines!'(69) Note\r\nthat He saith 'in serried lines'--meaning crowded and pressed together, one\r\nlocked to the next, each supporting his fellows. To do battle, as stated\r\nin the sacred verse, doth not, in this greatest of all dispensations, mean\r\nto go forth with sword and spear, with lance and piercing arrow--but rather\r\nweaponed with pure intent, with righteous motives, with counsels helpful\r\nand effective, with godly attributes, with deeds pleasing to the Almighty,\r\nwith the qualities of heaven. It signifieth education for all mankind,\r\nguidance for all men, the spreading far and wide of the sweet savours of\r\nthe spirit, the promulgation of God's proofs, the setting forth of\r\narguments conclusive and divine, the doing of charitable deeds.\r\n\r\nWhensoever holy souls, drawing on the powers of heaven, shall arise with\r\nsuch qualities of the spirit, and march in unison, rank on rank, every one\r\nof those souls will be even as one thousand, and the surging waves of that\r\nmighty ocean will be even as the battalions of the Concourse on high. What\r\na blessing that will be--when all shall come together, even as once\r\nseparate torrents, rivers and streams, running brooks and single drops,\r\nwhen collected together in one place will form a mighty sea. And to such a\r\ndegree will the inherent unity of all prevail, that the traditions, rules,\r\ncustoms and distinctions in the fanciful life of these populations will be\r\neffaced and vanish away like isolated drops, once the great sea of oneness\r\ndoth leap and surge and roll.\r\n\r\nI swear by the Ancient Beauty, that at such a time overwhelming grace will\r\nso encircle all, and the sea of grandeur will so overflow its shores, that\r\nthe narrowest strip of water will grow wide as an endless sea, and every\r\nmerest drop will be even as the shoreless deep.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! Struggle and strive to reach that high station,\r\nand to make a splendour so to shine across these realms of earth that the\r\nrays of it will be reflected back from a dawning-point on the horizon of\r\neternity. This is the very foundation of the Cause of God. This is the\r\nvery pith of the Law of God. This is the mighty structure raised up by the\r\nManifestations of God. This is why the orb of God's world dawneth. This is\r\nwhy the Lord establisheth Himself on the throne of His human body.\r\n\r\nO ye loved ones of God! See how the Exalted One(70)--may the souls of all\r\non earth be a ransom for Him--for this high purpose made His blessed heart\r\nthe target for affliction's spears; and because the real intent of the\r\nAncient Beauty--for Him may the souls of the Concourse on high be offered\r\nup--was to win this same supernal goal, the Exalted One bared His holy\r\nbreast for a target to a myriad bullets fired by the people of malice and\r\nhate, and with utter meekness died the martyr's death. On the dust of this\r\npathway the holy blood of thousands upon thousands of sacred souls gushed\r\nout, and many a time the blessed body of a loyal lover of God was hanged\r\nto the gallows tree.\r\n\r\nThe Abha Beauty Himself--may the spirit of all existence be offered up for\r\nHis loved ones--bore all manner of ordeals, and willingly accepted for\r\nHimself intense afflictions. No torment was there left that His sacred\r\nform was not subjected to, no suffering that did not descend upon Him. How\r\nmany a night, when He was chained, did He go sleepless because of the\r\nweight of His iron collar; how many a day the burning pain of the stocks\r\nand fetters gave Him no moment's peace. From Niyavaran to Tihran they made\r\nHim run--He, that embodied spirit, He Who had been accustomed to repose\r\nagainst cushions of ornamented silk--chained, shoeless, His head bared; and\r\ndown under the earth, in the thick darkness of that narrow dungeon, they\r\nshut Him up with murderers, rebels and thieves. Ever and again they\r\nassailed Him with a new torment, and all were certain that from one moment\r\nto the next He would suffer a martyr's death. After some time they\r\nbanished Him from His native land, and sent Him to countries alien and far\r\naway. During many a year in 'Iraq, no moment passed but the arrow of a new\r\nanguish struck His holy heart; with every breath a sword came down upon\r\nthat sacred body, and He could hope for no moment of security and rest.\r\nFrom every side His enemies mounted their attack with unrelenting hate;\r\nand singly and alone He withstood them all. After all these tribulations,\r\nthese body blows, they flung Him out of 'Iraq in the continent of Asia, to\r\nthe continent of Europe, and in that place of bitter exile, of wretched\r\nhardships, to the wrongs that were heaped upon Him by the people of the\r\nQur'an were now added the virulent persecutions, the powerful attacks, the\r\nplottings, the slanders, the continual hostilities, the hate and malice,\r\nof the people of the Bayan. My pen is powerless to tell it all; but ye\r\nhave surely been informed of it. Then, after twenty-four years in this,\r\nthe Most Great Prison, in agony and sore affliction, His days drew to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, the Ancient Beauty was ever, during His sojourn in this\r\ntransitory world, either a captive bound with chains, or living under a\r\nsword, or subjected to extreme suffering and torment, or held in the Most\r\nGreat Prison. Because of His physical weakness, brought on by His\r\nafflictions, His blessed body was worn away to a breath; it was light as a\r\ncobweb from long grieving. And His reason for shouldering this heavy load\r\nand enduring all this anguish, which was even as an ocean that hurleth its\r\nwaves to high heaven--His reason for putting on the heavy iron chains and\r\nfor becoming the very embodiment of utter resignation and meekness, was to\r\nlead every soul on earth to concord, to fellow-feeling, to oneness; to\r\nmake known amongst all peoples the sign of the singleness of God, so that\r\nat last the primal oneness deposited at the heart of all created things\r\nwould bear its destined fruit, and the splendour of 'No difference canst\r\nthou see in the creation of the God of Mercy,'(71) would cast abroad its\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nNow is the time, O ye beloved of the Lord, for ardent endeavour. Struggle\r\nye, and strive. And since the Ancient Beauty was exposed by day and night\r\non the field of martyrdom, let us in our turn labour hard, and hear and\r\nponder the counsels of God; let us fling away our lives, and renounce our\r\nbrief and numbered days. Let us turn our eyes away from empty fantasies of\r\nthis world's divergent forms, and serve instead this pre-eminent purpose,\r\nthis grand design. Let us not, because of our own imaginings, cut down\r\nthis tree that the hand of heavenly grace hath planted; let us not, with\r\nthe dark clouds of our illusions, our selfish interests, blot out the\r\nglory that streameth from the Abha Realm. Let us not be as barriers that\r\nwall out the rolling ocean of Almighty God. Let us not prevent the pure,\r\nsweet scents from the garden of the All-Glorious Beauty from blowing far\r\nand wide. Let us not, on this day of reunion, shut out the vernal downpour\r\nof blessings from on high. Let us not consent that the splendours of the\r\nSun of Truth should ever fade and disappear. These are the admonitions of\r\nGod, as set forth in His Holy Books, His Scriptures, His Tablets that tell\r\nout His counsellings to the sincere.\r\n\r\nThe glory rest upon you, and God's mercy, and God's blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n208: O YE SERVANTS OF THE SACRED THRESHOLD! THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye servants of the Sacred Threshold! The triumphant hosts of the\r\nCelestial Concourse, arrayed and marshalled in the Realms above, stand\r\nready and expectant to assist and assure victory to that valiant horseman\r\nwho with confidence spurs on his charger into the arena of service. Well\r\nis it with that fearless warrior, who armed with the power of true\r\nKnowledge, hastens unto the field, disperses the armies of ignorance, and\r\nscatters the hosts of error, who holds aloft the Standard of Divine\r\nGuidance, and sounds the Clarion of Victory. By the righteousness of the\r\nLord! He hath achieved a glorious triumph and obtained the true victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n209: O YE SERVANTS OF THE BLESSED BEAUTY!... IT IS CLEAR ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye servants of the Blessed Beauty!... It is clear that in this day,\r\nconfirmations from the unseen world are encompassing all those who deliver\r\nthe divine Message. Should the work of teaching lapse, these confirmations\r\nwould be entirely cut off, since it is impossible for the loved ones of\r\nGod to receive assistance unless they teach.\r\n\r\nUnder all conditions, the teaching must be carried forward, but with\r\nwisdom. If the work cannot proceed openly, then let them teach in private,\r\nand thus engender spirituality and fellowship among the children of men.\r\nIf, for example, each and every one of the believers would become a true\r\nfriend to one of the unheeding, and, conducting himself with absolute\r\nrectitude, associate with this soul, treat him with the utmost kindness,\r\nhimself exemplify the divine instructions he hath received, the good\r\nqualities and behaviour patterns, and at all times act in accord with the\r\nadmonitions of God--it is certain that little by little he will succeed in\r\nawakening that previously heedless individual, and in changing his\r\nignorance to knowledge of the truth.\r\n\r\nSouls are inclined toward estrangement. Steps should first be taken to do\r\naway with this estrangement, for only then will the Word take effect. If a\r\nbeliever showeth kindness to one of the neglectful, and, with great love,\r\ngradually leadeth him to an understanding of the validity of the Holy\r\nCause, so that he may come to know the fundamentals of God's Faith and the\r\nimplications thereof--such a one will certainly be transformed, excepting\r\nonly those seldom-encountered individuals who are even as ashes, whose\r\nhearts are 'hard as rocks, or harder still.'(72)\r\n\r\nIf every one of the friends should strive in this way to guide one soul\r\naright, the number of believers will double every year; and this can be\r\naccomplished with prudence and wisdom, and no harm whatever would result\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the teachers must travel about, and if spreading the Message\r\nopenly should cause a disturbance, then instead, let them stimulate and\r\ntrain the believers, inspire them, delight them, rejoice their hearts,\r\nrevive and refresh them with the sweet savours of holiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n210: O YE ROSES IN THE GARDEN OF GOD'S LOVE! O YE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye roses in the garden of God's love! O ye bright lamps in the\r\nassemblage of His knowledge! May the soft breathings of God pass over you,\r\nmay the Glory of God illumine the horizon of your hearts. Ye are the waves\r\nof the deep sea of knowledge, ye are the massed armies on the plains of\r\ncertitude, ye are the stars in the skies of God's compassion, ye are the\r\nstones that put the people of perdition to flight, ye are clouds of divine\r\npity over the gardens of life, ye are the abundant grace of God's oneness\r\nthat is shed upon the essences of all created things.\r\n\r\nOn the outspread tablet of this world, ye are the verses of His\r\nsingleness; and atop lofty palace towers, ye are the banners of the Lord.\r\nIn His bowers are ye the blossoms and sweet-smelling herbs, in the rose\r\ngarden of the spirit the nightingales that utter plaintive cries. Ye are\r\nthe birds that soar upward into the firmament of knowledge, the royal\r\nfalcons on the wrist of God.\r\n\r\nWhy then are ye quenched, why silent, why leaden and dull? Ye must shine\r\nforth like the lightning, and raise up a clamouring like unto the great\r\nsea. Like a candle must ye shed your light, and even as the soft breezes\r\nof God must ye blow across the world. Even as sweet breaths from heavenly\r\nbowers, as musk-laden winds from the gardens of the Lord, must ye perfume\r\nthe air for the people of knowledge, and even as the splendours shed by\r\nthe true Sun, must ye illumine the hearts of humankind. For ye are the\r\nlife-laden winds, ye are the jessamine-scents from the gardens of the\r\nsaved. Bring then life to the dead, and awaken those who slumber. In the\r\ndarkness of the world be ye radiant flames; in the sands of perdition, be\r\nye well-springs of the water of life, be ye guidance from the Lord God.\r\nNow is the time to serve, now is the time to be on fire. Know ye the value\r\nof this chance, this favourable juncture that is limitless grace, ere it\r\nslip from your hands.\r\n\r\nSoon will our handful of days, our vanishing life, be gone, and we shall\r\npass, empty-handed, into the hollow that is dug for those who speak no\r\nmore; wherefore must we bind our hearts to the manifest Beauty, and cling\r\nto the lifeline that faileth never. We must gird ourselves for service,\r\nkindle love's flame, and burn away in its heat. We must loose our tongues\r\ntill we set the wide world's heart afire, and with bright rays of guidance\r\nblot out the armies of the night, and then, for His sake, on the field of\r\nsacrifice, fling down our lives.\r\n\r\nThus let us scatter over every people the treasured gems of the\r\nrecognition of God, and with the decisive blade of the tongue, and the\r\nsure arrows of knowledge, let us defeat the hosts of self and passion, and\r\nhasten onward to the site of martyrdom, to the place where we die for the\r\nLord. And then, with flying flags, and to the beat of drums, let us pass\r\ninto the realm of the All-Glorious, and join the Company on high.\r\n\r\nWell is it with the doers of great deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n211: WHEN THE FRIENDS DO NOT ENDEAVOUR TO SPREAD THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the friends do not endeavour to spread the message, they fail to\r\nremember God befittingly, and will not witness the tokens of assistance\r\nand confirmation from the Abha Kingdom nor comprehend the divine\r\nmysteries. However, when the tongue of the teacher is engaged in teaching,\r\nhe will naturally himself be stimulated, will become a magnet attracting\r\nthe divine aid and bounty of the Kingdom, and will be like unto the bird\r\nat the hour of dawn, which itself becometh exhilarated by its own singing,\r\nits warbling and its melody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n212: IT IS AT SUCH TIMES THAT THE FRIENDS OF GOD AVAIL ...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is at such times that the friends of God avail themselves of the\r\noccasion, seize the opportunity, rush forth and win the prize. If their\r\ntask is to be confined to good conduct and advice, nothing will be\r\naccomplished. They must speak out, expound the proofs, set forth clear\r\narguments, draw irrefutable conclusions establishing the truth of the\r\nmanifestation of the Sun of Reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n213: THE TEACHING WORK SHOULD UNDER ALL CONDITIONS BE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teaching work should under all conditions be actively pursued by the\r\nbelievers because divine confirmations are dependent upon it. Should a\r\nBaha'i refrain from being fully, vigorously and wholeheartedly involved in\r\nthe teaching work he will undoubtedly be deprived of the blessings of the\r\nAbha Kingdom. Even so, this activity should be tempered with wisdom--not\r\nthat wisdom which requireth one to be silent and forgetful of such an\r\nobligation, but rather that which requireth one to display divine\r\ntolerance, love, kindness, patience, a goodly character, and holy deeds.\r\nIn brief, encourage the friends individually to teach the Cause of God and\r\ndraw their attention to this meaning of wisdom mentioned in the Writings,\r\nwhich is itself the essence of teaching the Faith--but all this to be done\r\nwith the greatest tolerance, so that heavenly assistance and divine\r\nconfirmation may aid the friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n214: FOLLOW THOU THE WAY OF THY LORD, AND SAY NOT ...\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow thou the way of thy Lord, and say not that which the ears cannot\r\nbear to hear, for such speech is like luscious food given to small\r\nchildren. However palatable, rare and rich the food may be, it cannot be\r\nassimilated by the digestive organs of a suckling child. Therefore unto\r\nevery one who hath a right, let his settled measure be given.\r\n\r\n'Not everything that a man knoweth can be disclosed, nor can everything\r\nthat he can disclose be regarded as timely, nor can every timely utterance\r\nbe considered as suited to the capacity of those who hear it.' Such is the\r\nconsummate wisdom to be observed in thy pursuits. Be not oblivious\r\nthereof, if thou wishest to be a man of action under all conditions. First\r\ndiagnose the disease and identify the malady, then prescribe the remedy,\r\nfor such is the perfect method of the skilful physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n215: MY HOPE FROM THE GRACE OF THE ONE TRUE LORD ...\r\n\r\n\r\nMy hope from the grace of the One true Lord is that thou wilt be enabled\r\nto spread the fragrances of God among the tribes. This is extremely\r\nimportant....\r\n\r\nIf thou succeedest in rendering this service thou shalt excel and be the\r\nleader in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n216: REST ASSURED THAT THE BREATHINGS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT ...\r\n\r\n\r\nRest assured that the breathings of the Holy Spirit will loosen thy\r\ntongue. Speak, therefore; speak out with great courage at every meeting.\r\nWhen thou art about to begin thine address, turn first to Baha'u'llah, and\r\nask for the confirmations of the Holy Spirit, then open thy lips and say\r\nwhatever is suggested to thy heart; this, however, with the utmost\r\ncourage, dignity and conviction. It is my hope that from day to day your\r\ngatherings will grow and flourish, and that those who are seeking after\r\ntruth will hearken therein to reasoned arguments and conclusive proofs. I\r\nam with you heart and soul at every meeting; be sure of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n217: THE TEACHER, WHEN TEACHING, MUST BE HIMSELF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teacher, when teaching, must be himself fully enkindled, so that his\r\nutterance, like unto a flame of fire, may exert influence and consume the\r\nveil of self and passion. He must also be utterly humble and lowly so that\r\nothers may be edified, and be totally self-effaced and evanescent so that\r\nhe may teach with the melody of the Concourse on high--otherwise his\r\nteaching will have no effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n218: O YE CLOSE AND DEAR FRIENDS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye close and dear friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha!\r\n\r\nIn the Orient scatter perfumes,\r\nAnd shed splendours on the West.\r\nCarry light unto the Bulgar,\r\nAnd the Slav with life invest.\r\n\r\nOne year after the ascension of Baha'u'llah, there came this verse from\r\nthe lips of the Centre of the Covenant. The Covenant-breakers found it\r\nstrange indeed, and they treated it with scorn. Yet, praised be God, its\r\neffects are now manifest, its power revealed, its import clear; for by\r\nGod's grace, today both East and West are trembling for joy, and now, from\r\nsweet waftings of holiness, the whole earth is scented with musk.\r\n\r\nThe Blessed Beauty, in unmistakable language, hath made this promise in\r\nHis Book: 'We behold you from Our realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever\r\nwill arise for the triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on\r\nhigh and a company of Our favoured angels.'(73)\r\n\r\nGod be thanked, that promised aid hath been vouchsafed, as is plain for\r\nall to see, and it shineth forth as clear as the sun in the heavens.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O ye friends of God, redouble your efforts, strain every nerve,\r\ntill ye triumph in your servitude to the Ancient Beauty, the Manifest\r\nLight, and become the cause of spreading far and wide the rays of the\r\nDay-Star of Truth. Breathe ye into the world's worn and wasted body the\r\nfresh breath of life, and in the furrows of every region sow ye holy seed.\r\nRise up to champion this Cause; open your lips and teach. In the meeting\r\nplace of life be ye a guiding candle; in the skies of this world be\r\ndazzling stars; in the gardens of unity be birds of the spirit, singing of\r\ninner truths and mysteries.\r\n\r\nExpend your every breath of life in this great Cause and dedicate all your\r\ndays to the service of Baha, so that in the end, safe from loss and\r\ndeprivation, ye will inherit the heaped-up treasures of the realms above.\r\nFor the days of a man are full of peril and he cannot rely on so much as a\r\nmoment more of life; and still the people, who are even as a wavering\r\nmirage of illusions, tell themselves that in the end they shall reach the\r\nheights. Alas for them! The men of bygone times hugged these same fancies\r\nto their breasts, until a wave flicked over them and they returned to\r\ndust, and they found themselves excluded and bereft--all save those souls\r\nwho had freed themselves from self and had flung away their lives in the\r\npathway of God. Their bright star shone out in the skies of ancient glory,\r\nand the handed-down memories of all the ages are the proof of what I say.\r\n\r\nWherefore, rest ye neither day nor night and seek no ease. Tell ye the\r\nsecrets of servitude, follow the pathway of service, till ye attain the\r\npromised succour that cometh from the realms of God.\r\n\r\nO friends! Black clouds have shrouded all this earth, and the darkness of\r\nhatred and malice, of cruelty and aggression and defilement is spreading\r\nfar and wide. The people, one and all, live out their lives in a heedless\r\nstupor and the chief virtues of man are held to be his rapacity and his\r\nthirst for blood. Out of all the mass of humankind God hath chosen the\r\nfriends, and He hath favoured them with His guidance and boundless grace.\r\nHis purpose is this, that we, all of us, should strive with our whole\r\nhearts to offer ourselves up, guide others to His path, and train the\r\nsouls of men--until these frenzied beasts change to gazelles in the meadows\r\nof oneness, and these wolves to lambs of God, and these brutish creatures\r\nto angelic hosts; till the fires of hatred are quenched, and the flame\r\ncoming out of the sheltered vale of the Holy Shrine doth shed its\r\nsplendours; till the foul odour of the tyrant's dunghill is blown away,\r\nand yieldeth to the pure, sweet scents that stream from the rosebeds of\r\nfaith and trust. On that day will the weak of intellect draw on the bounty\r\nof the divine, Universal Mind, and they whose life is but abomination will\r\nseek out these cleansing, holy breaths.\r\n\r\nBut there needs must be souls who will manifest such bestowals, there\r\nneeds must be husbandmen to till these fields, gardeners for these\r\ngardens, there needs must be fish to swim in this sea, stars to gleam in\r\nthese heavens. These ailing ones must be tended by spiritual physicians,\r\nthese who are the lost need gentle guides--so that from such souls the\r\nbereft may receive their portion, and the deprived obtain their share, and\r\nthe poor discover in such as they unmeasured wealth, and the seekers hear\r\nfrom them unanswerable proofs.\r\n\r\nO my Lord, my Defender, my Help in peril! Lowly do I entreat Thee, ailing\r\ndo I come unto Thee to be healed, humbly do I cry out to Thee with my\r\ntongue, my soul, my spirit:\r\n\r\nO God, my God! The gloom of night hath shrouded every region, and all the\r\nearth is shut away behind thick clouds. The peoples of the world are sunk\r\nin the black depths of vain illusions, while their tyrants wallow in\r\ncruelty and hate. I see nothing but the glare of searing fires that blaze\r\nupward from the nethermost abyss, I hear nothing save the thunderous roar\r\nthat belloweth out from thousands upon thousands of fiery weapons of\r\nassault, while every land is crying aloud in its secret tongue: 'My riches\r\navail me nothing, and my sovereignty hath perished!'\r\n\r\nO my Lord, the lamps of guidance have gone out. The flames of passion are\r\nmounting high, and malevolence is ever gaining on the world. Malice and\r\nhate have overspread the face of the whole earth, and I find no souls\r\nexcept Thine own oppressed small band who are raising up this cry:\r\n\r\nMake haste to love! Make haste to trust! Make haste to give! To guidance\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nCome ye for harmony! To behold the Star of Day! Come here for kindliness,\r\nfor ease! Come here for amity and peace!\r\n\r\nCome and cast down your weapons of wrath, till unity is won! Come and in\r\nthe Lord's true path each one help each one.\r\n\r\nVerily with exceeding joy, with heart and soul, do these oppressed of\r\nThine offer themselves up for all mankind in every land. Thou seest them,\r\nO my Lord, weeping over the tears Thy people shed, mourning the grief of\r\nThy children, condoling with humankind, suffering because of the\r\ncalamities that beset all the denizens of the earth.\r\n\r\nO my Lord, wing them with victory that they may soar upward to salvation,\r\nstrengthen their loins in service to Thy people, and their backs in\r\nservitude to Thy Threshold of Holiness.\r\n\r\nVerily Thou art the Generous, verily Thou art the Merciful! There is none\r\nother God save Thee, the Clement, the Pitiful, the Ancient of Days!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n219: O YE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE KINGDOM! YOUR ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom! Your letter, which was surely\r\ninspired of heaven, hath been received. Its contents were most pleasing,\r\nits sentiments arising out of luminous hearts.\r\n\r\nThe believers in London are indeed steadfast and true, they are resolute,\r\nthey are constant in service; when put to the test, they do not falter,\r\nnor doth their fire abate with the passage of time; rather, they are\r\nBaha'is. They are of heaven, they are filled with light, they are of God.\r\nWithout any doubt they will become the cause of raising high the Word of\r\nGod, and advancing the oneness of the world of man; of promoting the\r\nteachings of God, and spreading far and near the equality of every member\r\nof the human race.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to approach the Kingdom of Heaven, but hard to stand firm and\r\nstaunch within it, for the tests are rigorous, and heavy to bear. But the\r\nEnglish remain steadfast under all conditions, neither at the first sign\r\nof trouble do their footsteps slip. They are not changeable, playing fast\r\nand loose with some project and soon giving it up. They do not, for some\r\ntrivial reason, fail in enthusiasm and zeal, their interest gone. No, in\r\nall they do, they are stable, rock-solid and staunch.\r\n\r\nAlthough ye dwell in western lands, still, praise be to God, ye did hear\r\nHis call from out the east and, even as Moses, did warm your hands at the\r\nfire kindled in the Asian Tree. Ye did find the true path, were lit like\r\nunto lamps, and have come into the Kingdom of God. And now have ye arisen,\r\nout of gratitude for these blessings, and ye are asking God's help for all\r\nthe peoples of the earth, that their eyes as well may behold the\r\nsplendours of the Abha Realm, and their hearts, even as mirrors, reflect\r\nthe bright rays of the Sun of Truth.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that the breaths of the Holy Spirit will so be breathed into\r\nyour hearts that your tongues will disclose the mysteries, and set forth\r\nand expound the inner meanings of the Holy Books; that the friends will\r\nbecome physicians, and will, through the potent medicine of the heavenly\r\nTeachings, heal the long-standing diseases that afflict the body of this\r\nworld; that they will make the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dead to\r\ncome alive; that they will awaken those who are sound asleep.\r\n\r\nRest ye assured that the confirmations of the Holy Spirit will descend\r\nupon you, and that the armies of the Abha Kingdom will grant you the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n220: THE LORD OF ALL MANKIND HATH FASHIONED THIS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord of all mankind hath fashioned this human realm to be a Garden of\r\nEden, an earthly paradise. If, as it must, it findeth the way to harmony\r\nand peace, to love and mutual trust, it will become a true abode of bliss,\r\na place of manifold blessings and unending delights. Therein shall be\r\nrevealed the excellence of humankind, therein shall the rays of the Sun of\r\nTruth shine forth on every hand.\r\n\r\nRemember how Adam and the others once dwelt together in Eden. No sooner,\r\nhowever, did a quarrel break out between Adam and Satan than they were,\r\none and all, banished from the Garden, and this was meant as a warning to\r\nthe human race, a means of telling humankind that dissension--even with the\r\nDevil--is the way to bitter loss. This is why, in our illumined age, God\r\nteacheth that conflicts and disputes are not allowable, not even with\r\nSatan himself.\r\n\r\nGracious God! Even with such a lesson before him, how heedless is man!\r\nStill do we see his world at war from pole to pole. There is war among the\r\nreligions; war among the nations; war among the peoples; war among the\r\nrulers. What a welcome change would it be, if only these black clouds\r\nwould lift from off the skies of the world, so that the light of reality\r\ncould be shed abroad! If only the darksome dust of this continual fighting\r\nand killing could settle forever, and the sweet winds of God's\r\nloving-kindness could blow from out the well-spring of peace. Then would\r\nthis world become another world, and the earth would shine with the light\r\nof her Lord.\r\n\r\nIf there is any hope, it is solely in the bounties of God: that His\r\nstrengthening grace will come, and the struggling and contending will\r\ncease, and the acid bite of blood-dripping steel will be turned into the\r\nhoney-dew of friendship and probity and trust. How sweet would that day be\r\nin the mouth, how fragrant as musk the scent thereof.\r\n\r\nGod grant that the new year will bring a promise of the new peace. May He\r\nenable this distinguished assemblage to conclude a fair treaty and\r\nestablish a just covenant, that you may be blessed forever, across the\r\nunborn reaches of time.\r\n\r\n[Addressed to the readers of The Christian Commonwealth, 1 January 1913]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n221: O YE WHO ARE STEADFAST IN THE COVENANT! THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye who are steadfast in the Covenant! The pilgrim hath made mention of\r\neach one of you, and hath asked for a separate letter addressed to each,\r\nbut this wanderer in the wilderness of God's love is withheld from\r\ncorrespondence by a thousand preoccupations and concerns; and since out of\r\nthe easts and the wests of the earth there poureth a mounting flood of\r\nletters upon him, it would be impossible to send a separate letter to each\r\none, wherefore this one letter is addressed to each of you, that it may,\r\nas sealed wine, rejoice your souls and warm your hearts.\r\n\r\nO ye steadfast loved ones! The grace of God is beating down upon mankind,\r\neven as the rains in spring, and the rays of the manifest Light have made\r\nthis earth to be the envy of heaven. But alas, the blind are deprived of\r\nthis bounty, the heedless are closed off from it, the withered despair of\r\nit, the faded are dying away--so that even as flooding waters, this endless\r\nstream of grace passeth back into its primal source in a hidden sea. Only\r\na few receive this grace and take their share of it. Wherefore, let us put\r\nour hopes in whatever the strong arm of the Beloved can bring about.\r\n\r\nWe trust that in a time to come the slumberers will waken, and the\r\nheedless will be made aware, and the excluded will become initiates in the\r\nmysteries. Now must the friends work on with heart and soul and put forth\r\na mighty effort, until the ramparts of dissension are toppled down and the\r\nglories of the oneness of humanity lead all to unity.\r\n\r\nToday the one overriding need is unity and harmony among the beloved of\r\nthe Lord, for they should have among them but one heart and soul and\r\nshould, so far as in them lieth, unitedly withstand the hostility of all\r\nthe peoples of the world; they must bring to an end the benighted\r\nprejudices of all nations and religions and must make known to every\r\nmember of the human race that all are the leaves of one branch, the fruits\r\nof one bough.\r\n\r\nUntil such time, however, as the friends establish perfect unity among\r\nthemselves, how can they summon others to harmony and peace?\r\n\r\nThat soul which hath itself not come alive,\r\n\r\nCan it then hope another to revive? Reflect ye as to other than human\r\nforms of life and be ye\r\n\r\nadmonished thereby: those clouds that drift apart cannot produce the\r\nbounty of the rain, and are soon lost; a flock of sheep, once scattered,\r\nfalleth prey to the wolf, and birds that fly alone will be caught fast in\r\nthe claws of the hawk. What greater demonstration could there be that\r\nunity leadeth to flourishing life, while dissension and withdrawing from\r\nthe others, will lead only to misery; for these are the sure ways to\r\nbitter disappointment and ruin.\r\n\r\nThe holy Manifestations of God were sent down to make visible the oneness\r\nof humanity. For this did They endure unnumbered ills and tribulations,\r\nthat a community from amongst mankind's divergent peoples could gather\r\nwithin the shadow of the Word of God and live as one, and could, with\r\ndelight and grace, demonstrate on earth the unity of humankind. Therefore\r\nmust the desire of the friends be this, to bring together and unify all\r\npeoples, that all may receive a generous drink of this pure wine from this\r\ncup that is 'tempered at the camphor fountain.'(74) Let them make the\r\ndiffering populations to be as one and induce the hostile and murderous\r\nkindreds of the earth to love one another instead. Let them loose from\r\ntheir shackles the captives of sensual desires and cause the excluded to\r\nbecome intimates of the mysteries. Let them give to the bereft a share of\r\nthe blessings of these days; let them guide the portionless to\r\ninexhaustible treasure. This grace can come about through words and ways\r\nand deeds that are of the Unseen Kingdom but, lacking such, it can never\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe confirmations of God are the surety for these blessings; the sacred\r\nbounty of God bestoweth these great gifts. The friends of God are\r\nsupported by the Kingdom on high and they win their victories through the\r\nmassed armies of the most great guidance. Thus for them every difficulty\r\nwill be made smooth, every problem will most easily be solved.\r\n\r\nNote ye how easily, where unity existeth in a given family, the affairs of\r\nthat family are conducted; what progress the members of that family make,\r\nhow they prosper in the world. Their concerns are in order, they enjoy\r\ncomfort and tranquillity, they are secure, their position is assured, they\r\ncome to be envied by all. Such a family but addeth to its stature and its\r\nlasting honour, as day succeedeth day. And if we widen out the sphere of\r\nunity a little to include the inhabitants of a village who seek to be\r\nloving and united, who associate with and are kind to one another, what\r\ngreat advances they will be seen to make, how secure and protected they\r\nwill be. Then let us widen out the sphere a little more, let us take the\r\ninhabitants of a city, all of them together: if they establish the\r\nstrongest bonds of unity among themselves, how far they will progress,\r\neven in a brief period and what power they will exert. And if the sphere\r\nof unity be still further widened out, that is, if the inhabitants of a\r\nwhole country develop peaceable hearts, and if with all their hearts and\r\nsouls they yearn to cooperate with one another and to live in unity, and\r\nif they become kind and loving to one another, that country will achieve\r\nundying joy and lasting glory. Peace will it have, and plenty, and vast\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nNote then: if every clan, tribe, community, every nation, country,\r\nterritory on earth should come together under the single-hued pavilion of\r\nthe oneness of mankind, and by the dazzling rays of the Sun of Truth\r\nshould proclaim the universality of man; if they should cause all nations\r\nand all creeds to open wide their arms to one another, establish a World\r\nCouncil, and proceed to bind the members of society one to another by\r\nstrong mutual ties, what would happen then? There is no doubt whatsoever\r\nthat the divine Beloved, in all His endearing beauty, and with Him a\r\nmassive host of heavenly confirmations and human blessings and bestowals,\r\nwould appear in His full glory before the assemblage of the world.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O ye beloved of the Lord, bestir yourselves, do all in your\r\npower to be as one, to live in peace, each with the others: for ye are all\r\nthe drops from but one ocean, the foliage of one tree, the pearls from a\r\nsingle shell, the flowers and sweet herbs from the same one garden. And\r\nachieving that, strive ye to unite the hearts of those who follow other\r\nfaiths.\r\n\r\nFor one another must ye give up even life itself. To every human being\r\nmust ye be infinitely kind. Call none a stranger; think none to be your\r\nfoe. Be ye as if all men were your close kin and honoured friends. Walk ye\r\nin such wise that this fleeting world will change into a splendour and\r\nthis dismal heap of dust become a palace of delights. Such is the counsel\r\nof 'Abdu'l-Baha, this hapless servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n222: O YE HOMELESS AND WANDERERS IN THE PATH OF GOD! ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye homeless and wanderers in the Path of God! Prosperity, contentment,\r\nand freedom, however much desired and conducive to the gladness of the\r\nhuman heart, can in no wise compare with the trials of homelessness and\r\nadversity in the pathway of God; for such exile and banishment are blessed\r\nby the divine favour, and are surely followed by the mercy of Providence.\r\nThe joy of tranquillity in one's home, and the sweetness of freedom from\r\nall cares shall pass away, whilst the blessing of homelessness shall\r\nendure forever, and its far-reaching results shall be made manifest.\r\n\r\nAbraham's migration from His native land caused the bountiful gifts of the\r\nAll-Glorious to be made manifest, and the setting of Canaan's brightest\r\nstar unfolded to the eyes the radiance of Joseph. The flight of Moses, the\r\nProphet of Sinai, revealed the Flame of the Lord's burning Fire, and the\r\nrise of Jesus breathed the breaths of the Holy Spirit into the world. The\r\ndeparture of Muhammad, the Beloved of God, from the city of His birth was\r\nthe cause of the exaltation of God's Holy Word, and the banishment of the\r\nSacred Beauty led to the diffusion of the light of His divine Revelation\r\nthroughout all regions.\r\n\r\nTake ye good heed, O people of insight!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n223: O YE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE KINGDOM! YOUR ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom! Your letter was received. From its\r\ncontents it was known that, praise be to God, your hearts are in the\r\nutmost purity and your souls rejoice in the glad tidings of God. The mass\r\nof the people are occupied with self and worldly desire, are immersed in\r\nthe ocean of the nether world and are captives of the world of nature,\r\nsave those souls who have been freed from the chains and fetters of the\r\nmaterial world and, like unto swift-flying birds, are soaring in this\r\nunbounded realm. They are awake and vigilant, they shun the obscurity of\r\nthe world of nature, their highest wish centereth on the eradication from\r\namong men of the struggle for existence, the shining forth of the\r\nspirituality and the love of the realm on high, the exercise of utmost\r\nkindness among peoples, the realization of an intimate and close\r\nconnection between religions and the practice of the ideal of\r\nself-sacrifice. Then will the world of humanity be transformed into the\r\nKingdom of God.\r\n\r\nO ye friends, exert ye an effort! Every expenditure is in need of an\r\nincome. This day, in the world of humanity, men are all the time\r\nexpending, for war is nothing but the consumption of men and of wealth. At\r\nleast engage ye in a deed of profit to the world of humanity that ye may\r\npartially compensate for that loss. Perchance, through the divine\r\nconfirmations, ye may be assisted in promulgating amity and concord among\r\nmen, in substituting love for enmity, in causing universal peace to result\r\nfrom universal war and in converting loss and rancour into profit and\r\nlove. This wish will be realized through the power of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n224: O THOU SERVANT OF GOD! THY LETTER WAS RECEIVED. ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou servant of God! Thy letter was received. Its contents were lofty\r\nand sublime, and its aim high and far-reaching. The world of humanity is\r\nin need of great improvement, for it is a material jungle wherein trees\r\nwithout fruit flourish and useless weeds abound. If at all there is a tree\r\nthat beareth fruit it is overshadowed by the fruitless ones, and if a\r\nflower groweth in this jungle it is hidden and concealed. The world of\r\nmankind is in need of expert gardeners who may convert these forests into\r\ndelectable rose gardens, may substitute for these barren trees ones that\r\nyield fruit, and may replace these useless weeds with roses and fragrant\r\nherbs. Thus active souls and vigilant people rest neither by day nor by\r\nnight; they strive to be closely linked to the divine Kingdom and thereby\r\nbecome the manifestations of infinite bounty and ideal gardeners for these\r\nforests. Thus the world of humanity will be wholly transformed and the\r\nmerciful bounties become manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n225: O YE CONCOURSE OF THE KINGDOM OF ABHA! TWO ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye concourse of the Kingdom of Abha! Two calls to success and prosperity\r\nare being raised from the heights of the happiness of mankind, awakening\r\nthe slumbering, granting sight to the blind, causing the heedless to\r\nbecome mindful, bestowing hearing upon the deaf, unloosing the tongue of\r\nthe mute and resuscitating the dead.\r\n\r\nThe one is the call of civilization, of the progress of the material\r\nworld. This pertaineth to the world of phenomena, promoteth the principles\r\nof material achievement, and is the trainer for the physical\r\naccomplishments of mankind. It compriseth the laws, regulations, arts and\r\nsciences through which the world of humanity hath developed; laws and\r\nregulations which are the outcome of lofty ideals and the result of sound\r\nminds, and which have stepped forth into the arena of existence through\r\nthe efforts of the wise and cultured in past and subsequent ages. The\r\npropagator and executive power of this call is just government.\r\n\r\nThe other is the soul-stirring call of God, Whose spiritual teachings are\r\nsafeguards of the everlasting glory, the eternal happiness and\r\nillumination of the world of humanity, and cause attributes of mercy to be\r\nrevealed in the human world and the life beyond.\r\n\r\nThis second call is founded upon the instructions and exhortations of the\r\nLord and the admonitions and altruistic emotions belonging to the realm of\r\nmorality which, like unto a brilliant light, brighten and illumine the\r\nlamp of the realities of mankind. Its penetrative power is the Word of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nHowever, until material achievements, physical accomplishments and human\r\nvirtues are reinforced by spiritual perfections, luminous qualities and\r\ncharacteristics of mercy, no fruit or result shall issue therefrom, nor\r\nwill the happiness of the world of humanity, which is the ultimate aim, be\r\nattained. For although, on the one hand, material achievements and the\r\ndevelopment of the physical world produce prosperity, which exquisitely\r\nmanifests its intended aims, on the other hand dangers, severe calamities\r\nand violent afflictions are imminent.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when thou lookest at the orderly pattern of kingdoms, cities\r\nand villages, with the attractiveness of their adornments, the freshness\r\nof their natural resources, the refinement of their appliances, the ease\r\nof their means of travel, the extent of knowledge available about the\r\nworld of nature, the great inventions, the colossal enterprises, the noble\r\ndiscoveries and scientific researches, thou wouldst conclude that\r\ncivilization conduceth to the happiness and the progress of the human\r\nworld. Yet shouldst thou turn thine eye to the discovery of destructive\r\nand infernal machines, to the development of forces of demolition and the\r\ninvention of fiery implements, which uproot the tree of life, it would\r\nbecome evident and manifest unto thee that civilization is conjoined with\r\nbarbarism. Progress and barbarism go hand in hand, unless material\r\ncivilization be confirmed by Divine Guidance, by the revelations of the\r\nAll-Merciful and by godly virtues, and be reinforced by spiritual conduct,\r\nby the ideals of the Kingdom and by the outpourings of the Realm of Might.\r\n\r\nConsider now, that the most advanced and civilized countries of the world\r\nhave been turned into arsenals of explosives, that the continents of the\r\nglobe have been transformed into huge camps and battlefields, that the\r\npeoples of the world have formed themselves into armed nations, and that\r\nthe governments of the world are vying with each other as to who will\r\nfirst step into the field of carnage and bloodshed, thus subjecting\r\nmankind to the utmost degree of affliction.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this civilization and material progress should be combined with\r\nthe Most Great Guidance so that this nether world may become the scene of\r\nthe appearance of the bestowals of the Kingdom, and physical achievements\r\nmay be conjoined with the effulgences of the Merciful. This in order that\r\nthe beauty and perfection of the world of man may be unveiled and be\r\nmanifested before all in the utmost grace and splendour. Thus everlasting\r\nglory and happiness shall be revealed.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, throughout succeeding centuries and ages the call of\r\ncivilization hath been raised, the world of humanity hath been advancing\r\nand progressing day by day, various countries have been developing by\r\nleaps and bounds, and material improvements have increased, until the\r\nworld of existence obtained universal capacity to receive the spiritual\r\nteachings and to hearken to the Divine Call. The suckling babe passeth\r\nthrough various physical stages, growing and developing at every stage,\r\nuntil its body reacheth the age of maturity. Having arrived at this stage\r\nit acquireth the capacity to manifest spiritual and intellectual\r\nperfections. The lights of comprehension, intelligence and knowledge\r\nbecome perceptible in it and the powers of its soul unfold. Similarly, in\r\nthe contingent world, the human species hath undergone progressive\r\nphysical changes and, by a slow process, hath scaled the ladder of\r\ncivilization, realizing in itself the wonders, excellencies and gifts of\r\nhumanity in their most glorious form, until it gained the capacity to\r\nexpress the splendours of spiritual perfections and divine ideals and\r\nbecame capable of hearkening to the call of God. Then at last the call of\r\nthe Kingdom was raised, the spiritual virtues and perfections were\r\nrevealed, the Sun of Reality dawned, and the teachings of the Most Great\r\nPeace, of the oneness of the world of humanity and of the universality of\r\nmen, were promoted. We hope that the effulgence of these rays shall become\r\nmore and more intense, and the ideal virtues more resplendent, so that the\r\ngoal of this universal human process will be attained and the love of God\r\nwill appear in the utmost grace and beauty and bedazzle all hearts.\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of God! Know ye, verily, that the happiness of mankind lieth\r\nin the unity and the harmony of the human race, and that spiritual and\r\nmaterial developments are conditioned upon love and amity among all men.\r\nConsider ye the living creatures, namely those which move upon the earth\r\nand those which fly, those which graze and those which devour. Among the\r\nbeasts of prey each kind liveth apart from other species of its genus,\r\nobserving complete antagonism and hostility; and whenever they meet they\r\nimmediately fight and draw blood, gnashing their teeth and baring their\r\nclaws. This is the way in which ferocious beasts and bloodthirsty wolves\r\nbehave, carnivorous animals that live by themselves and fight for their\r\nlives. But the docile, good-natured and gentle animals, whether they\r\nbelong to the flying or grazing species, associate with one another in\r\ncomplete affinity, united in their flocks, and living their lives with\r\nenjoyment, happiness and contentment. Such are the birds that are\r\nsatisfied with and grateful for a few grains; they live in complete\r\ngladness, and break into rich and melodious song while soaring over\r\nmeadows, plains, hills and mountains. Similarly those animals which graze,\r\nlike the sheep, the antelope and the gazelle, consort in the greatest\r\namity, intimacy and unity while living in their plains and prairies in a\r\ncondition of complete contentment. But dogs, wolves, tigers, hyenas and\r\nthose other beasts of prey, are alienated from each other as they hunt and\r\nroam about alone. The creatures of the fields and birds of the air do not\r\neven shun or molest one another when they come upon their mutual grazing\r\nand resting grounds but accept each other with friendliness, unlike the\r\ndevouring beasts who immediately tear each other apart when one intrudes\r\nupon the other's cave or lair; yea, even if one merely passeth by the\r\nabode of another the latter at once rusheth out to attack and if possible\r\nkill the former.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it hath been made clear and manifest that in the animal kingdom\r\nalso love and affinity are the fruits of a gentle disposition, a pure\r\nnature and praiseworthy character, while discord and isolation are\r\ncharacteristic of the fierce beasts of the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Almighty hath not created in man the claws and teeth of ferocious\r\nanimals, nay rather hath the human form been fashioned and set with the\r\nmost comely attributes and adorned with the most perfect virtues. The\r\nhonour of this creation and the worthiness of this garment therefore\r\nrequire man to have love and affinity for his own kind, nay rather, to act\r\ntowards all living creatures with justice and equity.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, consider how the cause of the welfare, happiness, joy and\r\ncomfort of humankind are amity and union, whereas dissension and discord\r\nare most conducive to hardship, humiliation, agitation and failure.\r\n\r\nBut a thousand times alas, that man is negligent and unaware of these\r\nfacts, and daily doth he strut abroad with the characteristics of a wild\r\nbeast. Lo! At one moment he turneth into a ferocious tiger; at the next he\r\nbecometh a creeping, venomous viper! But the sublime achievements of man\r\nreside in those qualities and attributes that exclusively pertain to the\r\nangels of the Supreme Concourse. Therefore, when praiseworthy qualities\r\nand high morals emanate from man, he becometh a heavenly being, an angel\r\nof the Kingdom, a divine reality and a celestial effulgence. On the other\r\nhand, when he engageth in warfare, quarrelling and bloodshed, he becometh\r\nviler than the most fierce of savage creatures, for if a bloodthirsty wolf\r\ndevoureth a lamb in a single night, man slaughtereth a hundred thousand in\r\nthe field of battle, strewing the ground with their corpses and kneading\r\nthe earth with their blood.\r\n\r\nIn short, man is endowed with two natures: one tendeth towards moral\r\nsublimity and intellectual perfection, while the other turneth to bestial\r\ndegradation and carnal imperfections. If ye travel the countries of the\r\nglobe ye shall observe on one side the remains of ruin and destruction,\r\nwhile on the other ye shall see the signs of civilization and development.\r\nSuch desolation and ruin are the result of war, strife and quarrelling,\r\nwhile all development and progress are fruits of the lights of virtue,\r\nco-operation and concord.\r\n\r\nIf one were to travel through the deserts of Central Asia he would observe\r\nhow many cities, once great and prosperous like Paris and London, are now\r\ndemolished and razed to the ground. From the Caspian Sea to the River Oxus\r\nthere stretch wild and desolate plains, deserts, wildernesses and valleys.\r\nFor two days and two nights the Russian railway traverseth the ruined\r\ncities and uninhabited villages of that wasteland. Formerly that plain\r\nbore the fruit of the finest civilizations of the past. Tokens of\r\ndevelopment and refinement were apparent all around, arts and sciences\r\nwere well protected and promoted, professions and industries flourished,\r\ncommerce and agriculture had reached a high stage of efficiency, and the\r\nfoundations of government and statesmanship were laid on a strong and\r\nsolid basis. Today that vast stretch of land hath become mostly the\r\nshelter and asylum of Turkoman tribes, and an arena for the ferocious\r\ndisplay of wild beasts. The ancient cities of that plain, such as Gurgan,\r\nNissa, Abivard and _Sh_ahristan, famous throughout the world for their\r\narts, sciences, culture, industry, and well known for their wealth,\r\ngreatness, prosperity and distinction, have given way to a wilderness\r\nwherein no voice is heard save the roaring of wild beasts and where\r\nbloodthirsty wolves roam at will. This destruction and desolation was\r\nbrought about by war and strife, dissension and discord between the\r\nPersians and the Turks, who differed in their religion and customs. So\r\nrigid was the spirit of religious prejudice that the faithless leaders\r\nsanctioned the shedding of innocent blood, the ruin of property and the\r\ndesecration of family honour. This is to cite only one illustration.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when thou traversest the regions of the world, thou shalt\r\nconclude that all progress is the result of association and co-operation,\r\nwhile ruin is the outcome of animosity and hatred. Notwithstanding this,\r\nthe world of humanity doth not take warning, nor doth it awake from the\r\nslumber of heedlessness. Man is still causing differences, quarrels and\r\nstrife in order to marshal the cohorts of war and, with his legions, rush\r\ninto the field of bloodshed and slaughter.\r\n\r\nThen again, consider the phenomenon of composition and decomposition, of\r\nexistence and non-existence. Every created thing in the contingent world\r\nis made up of many and varied atoms, and its existence is dependent on the\r\ncomposition of these. In other words, through the divine creative power a\r\nconjunction of simple elements taketh place so that from this composition\r\na distinct organism is produced. The existence of all things is based upon\r\nthis principle. But when the order is deranged, decomposition is produced\r\nand disintegration setteth in, then that thing ceaseth to exist. That is,\r\nthe annihilation of all things is caused by decomposition and\r\ndisintegration. Therefore attraction and composition between the various\r\nelements is the means of life, and discord, decomposition and division\r\nproduce death. Thus the cohesive and attractive forces in all things lead\r\nto the appearance of fruitful results and effects, while estrangement and\r\nalienation of things lead to disturbance and annihilation. Through\r\naffinity and attraction all living things like plants, animals and men\r\ncome into existence, while division and discord bring about decomposition\r\nand destruction.\r\n\r\nConsequently, that which is conducive to association and attraction and\r\nunity among the sons of men is the means of the life of the world of\r\nhumanity, and whatever causeth division, repulsion and remoteness leadeth\r\nto the death of humankind.\r\n\r\nAnd if, as thou passest by fields and plantations, thou observest that the\r\nplants, flowers and sweet-smelling herbs are growing luxuriantly together,\r\nforming a pattern of unity, this is an evidence of the fact that that\r\nplantation and garden is flourishing under the care of a skilful gardener.\r\nBut when thou seest it in a state of disorder and irregularity thou\r\ninferrest that it hath lacked the training of an efficient farmer and thus\r\nhath produced weeds and tares.\r\n\r\nIt therefore becometh manifest that amity and cohesion are indicative of\r\nthe training of the Real Educator, and dispersion and separation a proof\r\nof savagery and deprivation of divine education.\r\n\r\nA critic may object, saying that peoples, races, tribes and communities of\r\nthe world are of different and varied customs, habits, tastes, character,\r\ninclinations and ideas, that opinions and thoughts are contrary to one\r\nanother, and how, therefore, is it possible for real unity to be revealed\r\nand perfect accord among human souls to exist?\r\n\r\nIn answer we say that differences are of two kinds. One is the cause of\r\nannihilation and is like the antipathy existing among warring nations and\r\nconflicting tribes who seek each other's destruction, uprooting one\r\nanother's families, depriving one another of rest and comfort and\r\nunleashing carnage. The other kind which is a token of diversity is the\r\nessence of perfection and the cause of the appearance of the bestowals of\r\nthe Most Glorious Lord.\r\n\r\nConsider the flowers of a garden: though differing in kind, colour, form\r\nand shape, yet, inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters of one\r\nspring, revived by the breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one\r\nsun, this diversity increaseth their charm, and addeth unto their beauty.\r\nThus when that unifying force, the penetrating influence of the Word of\r\nGod, taketh effect, the difference of customs, manners, habits, ideas,\r\nopinions and dispositions embellisheth the world of humanity. This\r\ndiversity, this difference is like the naturally created dissimilarity and\r\nvariety of the limbs and organs of the human body, for each one\r\ncontributeth to the beauty, efficiency and perfection of the whole. When\r\nthese different limbs and organs come under the influence of man's\r\nsovereign soul, and the soul's power pervadeth the limbs and members,\r\nveins and arteries of the body, then difference reinforceth harmony,\r\ndiversity strengtheneth love, and multiplicity is the greatest factor for\r\nco-ordination.\r\n\r\nHow unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and plants, the leaves and\r\nblossoms, the fruits, the branches and the trees of that garden were all\r\nof the same shape and colour! Diversity of hues, form and shape, enricheth\r\nand adorneth the garden, and heighteneth the effect thereof. In like\r\nmanner, when divers shades of thought, temperament and character, are\r\nbrought together under the power and influence of one central agency, the\r\nbeauty and glory of human perfection will be revealed and made manifest.\r\nNaught but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth and\r\ntranscendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing the\r\ndivergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas, and convictions of the children of\r\nmen. Verily, it is the penetrating power in all things, the mover of souls\r\nand the binder and regulator in the world of humanity.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God, today the splendour of the Word of God hath illumined\r\nevery horizon, and from all sects, races, tribes, nations, and communities\r\nsouls have come together in the light of the Word, assembled, united and\r\nagreed in perfect harmony. Oh! What a great number of meetings are held\r\nadorned with souls from various races and diverse sects! Anyone attending\r\nthese will be struck with amazement, and might suppose that these souls\r\nare all of one land, one nationality, one community, one thought, one\r\nbelief and one opinion; whereas, in fact, one is an American, the other an\r\nAfrican, one cometh from Asia and another from Europe, one is a native of\r\nIndia, another is from Turkestan, one is an Arab, another a Tajik, another\r\na Persian and yet another a Greek. Notwithstanding such diversity they\r\nassociate in perfect harmony and unity, love and freedom; they have one\r\nvoice, one thought and one purpose. Verily, this is from the penetrative\r\npower of the Word of God! If all the forces of the universe were to\r\ncombine they would not be able thus to gather a single assemblage so\r\nimbued with the sentiments of love, affection, attraction and enkindlement\r\nas to unite the members of different races and to raise up from the heart\r\nof the world a voice that shall dispel war and strife, uproot dissension\r\nand disputation, usher in the era of universal peace and establish unity\r\nand concord amongst men.\r\n\r\nCan any power withstand the penetrative influence of the Word of God? Nay,\r\nby God! The proof is clear and the evidence is complete! If anyone looketh\r\nwith the eyes of justice he shall be struck with wonder and amazement and\r\nwill testify that all the peoples, sects and races of the world should be\r\nglad, content and grateful for the teachings and admonitions of\r\nBaha'u'llah. For these divine injunctions tame every ferocious beast,\r\ntransform the creeping insect into a soaring bird, cause human souls to\r\nbecome angels of the Kingdom, and make the human world a focus for the\r\nqualities of mercy.\r\n\r\nFurthermore each and every one is required to show obedience, submission\r\nand loyalty towards his own government. Today no state in the world is in\r\na condition of peace or tranquillity, for security and trust have vanished\r\nfrom among the people. Both the governed and the governors are alike in\r\ndanger. The only group of people which today submitteth peacefully and\r\nloyally to the laws and ordinances of government and dealeth honestly and\r\nfrankly with the people, is none other than this wronged community. For\r\nwhile all sects and races in Persia and Turkestan are absorbed in\r\npromoting their own interests and only obey their governments either with\r\nthe hope of reward or from fear of punishment, the Baha'is are the\r\nwell-wishers of the government, obedient to its laws and bearing love\r\ntowards all peoples.\r\n\r\nSuch obedience and submission is made incumbent and obligatory upon all by\r\nthe clear Text of the Abha Beauty. Therefore the believers, in obedience\r\nto the command of the True One, show the utmost sincerity and goodwill\r\ntowards all nations; and should any soul act contrary to the laws of the\r\ngovernment he would consider himself responsible before God, deserving\r\ndivine wrath and chastisement for his sin and wrongdoing. It is\r\nastonishing that, in spite of this, some of the officials of the\r\ngovernment consider the Baha'is to be ill-wishers while they regard the\r\nmembers of other communities as their well-wishers. Gracious God!\r\nRecently, when there was general revolution and agitation in Tihran and in\r\nother provinces of Persia, it was proven that not a single Baha'i had\r\ntaken part nor intervened in these affairs. For this reason they were\r\nreproached by the ignorant because they had obeyed the command of the\r\nBlessed Perfection and refrained absolutely from interference in political\r\nmatters. They were not associated with any party, but busied themselves\r\nwith their own affairs and professions and discharged their own duties.\r\n\r\nAll the friends of God bear witness to the fact that 'Abdu'l-Baha is, from\r\nevery standpoint, the well-wisher of all governments and nations, and\r\nprayeth sincerely for their progress and advancement, especially for the\r\ntwo great states of the east, for these two countries are the native land\r\nand the place of exile of Baha'u'llah. In all epistles and writings he\r\nhath commended and praised these two governments and hath supplicated\r\ndivine confirmations for them from the Threshold of the One true God. The\r\nAbha Beauty--may my life be a sacrifice for His loved ones--hath offered\r\nprayers on behalf of Their Imperial Majesties. Gracious God! How strange\r\nthat, notwithstanding these conclusive proofs, every day some event\r\ntranspireth and difficulties arise. But we, and the friends of God, should\r\non no account slacken our efforts to be loyal, sincere and men of good\r\nwill. We should at all times manifest our truthfulness and sincerity, nay\r\nrather, we must be constant in our faithfulness and trustworthiness, and\r\noccupy ourselves in offering prayers for the good of all.\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of God, these are days for steadfastness, for firmness and\r\nperseverance in the Cause of God. Ye must not focus your attention upon\r\nthe person of 'Abdu'l-Baha, for erelong he will bid you farewell. Rather\r\nmust ye fix your gaze upon the Word of God. If the Word of God is being\r\npromoted, rejoice and be happy and thankful, though 'Abdu'l-Baha himself\r\nbe threatened by the sword or burdened by the weight of chains and\r\nfetters. For the Holy Temple of the Cause of God is important, not the\r\nphysical body of 'Abdu'l-Baha. The friends of God must arise with such\r\nsteadfastness that if, at any moment, a hundred souls like 'Abdu'l-Baha\r\nbecome the target for the arrows of affliction, they will not shift or\r\nwaver in their resolve, their determination, their enkindlement, their\r\ndevotion and service in the Cause of God. 'Abdu'l-Baha is himself a\r\nservant at the Threshold of the Blessed Beauty and a manifestation of pure\r\nand utter servitude at the Threshold of the Almighty. He hath no other\r\nstation or title, no other rank or power. This is my ultimate Purpose, my\r\neternal Paradise, my holiest Temple and my Sadratu'l-Muntaha. With the\r\nAbha Blessed Beauty and the Exalted One, His Herald--may my life be a\r\nsacrifice for Them both--hath ended the appearance of God's independent and\r\nuniversal Manifestation. And for a thousand years all shall be illumined\r\nby His lights and be sustained by the ocean of His favours.\r\n\r\nO ye lovers of God! This, verily, is my last wish and my admonition unto\r\nyou. Blessed, therefore, is he who is aided by God to follow that which is\r\ninscribed upon this scroll whose words are sanctified from the symbols\r\ncurrent amongst men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n226: O THOU SERVANT OF GOD! THY LETTER WAS RECEIVED, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou servant of God! Thy letter was received, and was the cause of\r\ngladness. Thou hast expressed thine ardent wish that I should attend the\r\nPeace Congress. I do not present myself at such political conferences, for\r\nthe establishment of peace is unachievable save through the power of the\r\nWord of God. When a conference is convened, representative of all nations\r\nand working under the influence of the Word of God, then universal peace\r\nwill be established but otherwise it is impossible.\r\n\r\nAt present it is certain that temporary peace is established but it is not\r\nlasting. All governments and nations have become tired of war, of the\r\ndifficulties of travel, of huge expenditures, of the loss of life, of the\r\naffliction of women, of the great number of orphans, and they are driven\r\nby force to peace. But this peace is not permanent, it is temporary.\r\n\r\nWe hope that the power of the Word of God will establish a peace that\r\nshall eternally remain effective and secure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n227: O YE ESTEEMED ONES WHO ARE PIONEERS AMONG THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\n(75) O ye esteemed ones who are pioneers among the well-wishers of the\r\nworld of humanity!\r\n\r\nThe letters which ye sent during the war were not received, but a letter\r\ndated February 11th, 1916, has just come to hand, and immediately an\r\nanswer is being written. Your intention deserves a thousand praises,\r\nbecause you are serving the world of humanity, and this is conducive to\r\nthe happiness and welfare of all. This recent war has proved to the world\r\nand the people that war is destruction while universal peace is\r\nconstruction; war is death while peace is life; war is rapacity and\r\nbloodthirstiness while peace is beneficence and humaneness; war is an\r\nappurtenance of the world of nature while peace is of the foundation of\r\nthe religion of God; war is darkness upon darkness while peace is heavenly\r\nlight; war is the destroyer of the edifice of mankind while peace is the\r\neverlasting life of the world of humanity; war is like a devouring wolf\r\nwhile peace is like the angels of heaven; war is the struggle for\r\nexistence while peace is mutual aid and co-operation among the peoples of\r\nthe world and the cause of the good-pleasure of the True One in the\r\nheavenly realm.\r\n\r\nThere is not one soul whose conscience does not testify that in this day\r\nthere is no more important matter in the world than that of universal\r\npeace. Every just one bears witness to this and adores that esteemed\r\nAssembly because its aim is that this darkness may be changed into light,\r\nthis bloodthirstiness into kindness, this torment into bliss, this\r\nhardship into ease and this enmity and hatred into fellowship and love.\r\nTherefore, the effort of those esteemed souls is worthy of praise and\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\nBut the wise souls who are aware of the essential relationships emanating\r\nfrom the realities of things consider that one single matter cannot, by\r\nitself, influence the human reality as it ought and should, for until the\r\nminds of men become united, no important matter can be accomplished. At\r\npresent universal peace is a matter of great importance, but unity of\r\nconscience is essential, so that the foundation of this matter may become\r\nsecure, its establishment firm and its edifice strong.\r\n\r\nTherefore Baha'u'llah, fifty years ago, expounded this question of\r\nuniversal peace at a time when He was confined in the fortress of Akka and\r\nwas wronged and imprisoned. He wrote about this important matter of\r\nuniversal peace to all the great sovereigns of the world, and established\r\nit among His friends in the orient. The horizon of the east was in utter\r\ndarkness, nations displayed the utmost hatred and enmity towards each\r\nother, religions thirsted for each other's blood, and it was darkness upon\r\ndarkness. At such a time Baha'u'llah shone forth like the sun from the\r\nhorizon of the east and illumined Persia with the lights of these\r\nteachings.\r\n\r\nAmong His teachings was the declaration of universal peace. People of\r\ndifferent nations, religions and sects who followed Him came together to\r\nsuch an extent that remarkable gatherings were instituted consisting of\r\nthe various nations and religions of the east. Every soul who entered\r\nthese gatherings saw but one nation, one teaching, one pathway, one order,\r\nfor the teachings of Baha'u'llah were not limited to the establishment of\r\nuniversal peace. They embraced many teachings which supplemented and\r\nsupported that of universal peace.\r\n\r\nAmong these teachings was the independent investigation of reality so that\r\nthe world of humanity may be saved from the darkness of imitation and\r\nattain to the truth; may tear off and cast away this ragged and outgrown\r\ngarment of a thousand years ago and may put on the robe woven in the\r\nutmost purity and holiness in the loom of reality. As reality is one and\r\ncannot admit of multiplicity, therefore different opinions must ultimately\r\nbecome fused into one.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is the oneness of the world of\r\nhumanity; that all human beings are the sheep of God and He is the kind\r\nShepherd. This Shepherd is kind to all the sheep, because He created them\r\nall, trained them, provided for them and protected them. There is no doubt\r\nthat the Shepherd is kind to all the sheep and should there be among these\r\nsheep ignorant ones, they must be educated; if there be children, they\r\nmust be trained until they reach maturity; if there be sick ones, they\r\nmust be cured. There must be no hatred and enmity, for as by a kind\r\nphysician these ignorant, sick ones should be treated.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that religion must be the cause\r\nof fellowship and love. If it becomes the cause of estrangement then it is\r\nnot needed, for religion is like a remedy; if it aggravates the disease\r\nthen it becomes unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that religion must be in\r\nconformity with science and reason, so that it may influence the hearts of\r\nmen. The foundation must be solid and must not consist of imitations.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that religious, racial,\r\npolitical, economic and patriotic prejudices destroy the edifice of\r\nhumanity. As long as these prejudices prevail, the world of humanity will\r\nnot have rest. For a period of 6,000 years history informs us about the\r\nworld of humanity. During these 6,000 years the world of humanity has not\r\nbeen free from war, strife, murder and bloodthirstiness. In every period\r\nwar has been waged in one country or another and that war was due to\r\neither religious prejudice, racial prejudice, political prejudice or\r\npatriotic prejudice. It has therefore been ascertained and proved that all\r\nprejudices are destructive of the human edifice. As long as these\r\nprejudices persist, the struggle for existence must remain dominant, and\r\nbloodthirstiness and rapacity continue. Therefore, even as was the case in\r\nthe past, the world of humanity cannot be saved from the darkness of\r\nnature and cannot attain illumination except through the abandonment of\r\nprejudices and the acquisition of the morals of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf this prejudice and enmity are on account of religion consider that\r\nreligion should be the cause of fellowship, otherwise it is fruitless. And\r\nif this prejudice be the prejudice of nationality consider that all\r\nmankind are of one nation; all have sprung from the tree of Adam, and Adam\r\nis the root of the tree. That tree is one and all these nations are like\r\nbranches, while the individuals of humanity are like leaves, blossoms and\r\nfruits thereof. Then the establishment of various nations and the\r\nconsequent shedding of blood and destruction of the edifice of humanity\r\nresult from human ignorance and selfish motives.\r\n\r\nAs to the patriotic prejudice, this is also due to absolute ignorance, for\r\nthe surface of the earth is one native land. Every one can live in any\r\nspot on the terrestrial globe. Therefore all the world is man's\r\nbirthplace. These boundaries and outlets have been devised by man. In the\r\ncreation, such boundaries and outlets were not assigned. Europe is one\r\ncontinent, Asia is one continent, Africa is one continent, Australia is\r\none continent, but some of the souls, from personal motives and selfish\r\ninterests, have divided each one of these continents and considered a\r\ncertain part as their own country. God has set up no frontier between\r\nFrance and Germany; they are continuous. Yea, in the first centuries,\r\nselfish souls, for the promotion of their own interests, have assigned\r\nboundaries and outlets and have, day by day, attached more importance to\r\nthese, until this led to intense enmity, bloodshed and rapacity in\r\nsubsequent centuries. In the same way this will continue indefinitely, and\r\nif this conception of patriotism remains limited within a certain circle,\r\nit will be the primary cause of the world's destruction. No wise and just\r\nperson will acknowledge these imaginary distinctions. Every limited area\r\nwhich we call our native country we regard as our motherland, whereas the\r\nterrestrial globe is the motherland of all, and not any restricted area.\r\nIn short, for a few days we live on this earth and eventually we are\r\nburied in it, it is our eternal tomb. Is it worth while that we should\r\nengage in bloodshed and tear one another to pieces for this eternal tomb?\r\nNay, far from it, neither is God pleased with such conduct nor would any\r\nsane man approve of it.\r\n\r\nConsider! The blessed animals engage in no patriotic quarrels. They are in\r\nthe utmost fellowship with one another and live together in harmony. For\r\nexample, if a dove from the east and a dove from the west, a dove from the\r\nnorth and a dove from the south chance to arrive, at the same time, in one\r\nspot, they immediately associate in harmony. So is it with all the blessed\r\nanimals and birds. But the ferocious animals, as soon as they meet, attack\r\nand fight with each other, tear each other to pieces and it is impossible\r\nfor them to live peaceably together in one spot. They are all unsociable\r\nand fierce, savage and combative fighters.\r\n\r\nRegarding the economic prejudice, it is apparent that whenever the ties\r\nbetween nations become strengthened and the exchange of commodities\r\naccelerated, and any economic principle is established in one country, it\r\nwill ultimately affect the other countries and universal benefits will\r\nresult. Then why this prejudice?\r\n\r\nAs to the political prejudice, the policy of God must be followed and it\r\nis indisputable that the policy of God is greater than human policy. We\r\nmust follow the Divine policy and that applies alike to all individuals.\r\nHe treats all individuals alike: no distinction is made, and that is the\r\nfoundation of the Divine Religions.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is the origination of one language\r\nthat may be spread universally among the people. This teaching was\r\nrevealed from the pen of Baha'u'llah in order that this universal language\r\nmay eliminate misunderstandings from among mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is the equality of women and men.\r\nThe world of humanity has two wings--one is women and the other men. Not\r\nuntil both wings are equally developed can the bird fly. Should one wing\r\nremain weak, flight is impossible. Not until the world of women becomes\r\nequal to the world of men in the acquisition of virtues and perfections,\r\ncan success and prosperity be attained as they ought to be.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is voluntary sharing of one's\r\nproperty with others among mankind. This voluntary sharing is greater than\r\nequality, and consists in this, that man should not prefer himself to\r\nothers, but rather should sacrifice his life and property for others. But\r\nthis should not be introduced by coercion so that it becomes a law and man\r\nis compelled to follow it. Nay, rather, man should voluntarily and of his\r\nown choice sacrifice his property and life for others, and spend willingly\r\nfor the poor, just as is done in Persia among the Baha'is.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is man's freedom, that through the\r\nideal Power he should be free and emancipated from the captivity of the\r\nworld of nature; for as long as man is captive to nature he is a ferocious\r\nanimal, as the struggle for existence is one of the exigencies of the\r\nworld of nature. This matter of the struggle for existence is the\r\nfountain-head of all calamities and is the supreme affliction.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that religion is a mighty\r\nbulwark. If the edifice of religion shakes and totters, commotion and\r\nchaos will ensue and the order of things will be utterly upset, for in the\r\nworld of mankind there are two safeguards that protect man from\r\nwrongdoing. One is the law which punishes the criminal; but the law\r\nprevents only the manifest crime and not the concealed sin; whereas the\r\nideal safeguard, namely, the religion of God, prevents both the manifest\r\nand the concealed crime, trains man, educates morals, compels the adoption\r\nof virtues and is the all-inclusive power which guarantees the felicity of\r\nthe world of mankind. But by religion is meant that which is ascertained\r\nby investigation and not that which is based on mere imitation, the\r\nfoundations of Divine Religions and not human imitations.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is that although material\r\ncivilization is one of the means for the progress of the world of mankind,\r\nyet until it becomes combined with Divine civilization, the desired\r\nresult, which is the felicity of mankind, will not be attained. Consider!\r\nThese battleships that reduce a city to ruins within the space of an hour\r\nare the result of material civilization; likewise the Krupp guns, the\r\nMauser rifles, dynamite, submarines, torpedo boats, armed aircraft and\r\nbombers--all these weapons of war are the malignant fruits of material\r\ncivilization. Had material civilization been combined with Divine\r\ncivilization, these fiery weapons would never have been invented. Nay,\r\nrather, human energy would have been wholly devoted to useful inventions\r\nand would have been concentrated on praiseworthy discoveries. Material\r\ncivilization is like a lamp-glass. Divine civilization is the lamp itself\r\nand the glass without the light is dark. Material civilization is like the\r\nbody. No matter how infinitely graceful, elegant and beautiful it may be,\r\nit is dead. Divine civilization is like the spirit, and the body gets its\r\nlife from the spirit, otherwise it becomes a corpse. It has thus been made\r\nevident that the world of mankind is in need of the breaths of the Holy\r\nSpirit. Without the spirit the world of mankind is lifeless, and without\r\nthis light the world of mankind is in utter darkness. For the world of\r\nnature is an animal world. Until man is born again from the world of\r\nnature, that is to say, becomes detached from the world of nature, he is\r\nessentially an animal, and it is the teachings of God which convert this\r\nanimal into a human soul.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is the promotion of education.\r\nEvery child must be instructed in sciences as much as is necessary. If the\r\nparents are able to provide the expenses of this education, it is well,\r\notherwise the community must provide the means for the teaching of that\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nAnd among the teachings of Baha'u'llah are justice and right. Until these\r\nare realized on the plane of existence, all things shall be in disorder\r\nand remain imperfect. The world of mankind is a world of oppression and\r\ncruelty, and a realm of aggression and error.\r\n\r\nIn fine, such teachings are numerous. These manifold principles, which\r\nconstitute the greatest basis for the felicity of mankind and are of the\r\nbounties of the Merciful, must be added to the matter of universal peace\r\nand combined with it, so that results may accrue. Otherwise the\r\nrealization of universal peace by itself in the world of mankind is\r\ndifficult. As the teachings of Baha'u'llah are combined with universal\r\npeace, they are like a table provided with every kind of fresh and\r\ndelicious food. Every soul can find, at that table of infinite bounty,\r\nthat which he desires. If the question is restricted to universal peace\r\nalone, the remarkable results which are expected and desired will not be\r\nattained. The scope of universal peace must be such that all the\r\ncommunities and religions may find their highest wish realized in it. The\r\nteachings of Baha'u'llah are such that all the communities of the world,\r\nwhether religious, political or ethical, ancient or modern, find in them\r\nthe expression of their highest wish.\r\n\r\nFor example, the people of religions find, in the teachings of\r\nBaha'u'llah, the establishment of Universal Religion--a religion that\r\nperfectly conforms with present conditions, which in reality effects the\r\nimmediate cure of the incurable disease, which relieves every pain, and\r\nbestows the infallible antidote for every deadly poison. For if we wish to\r\narrange and organize the world of mankind in accordance with the present\r\nreligious imitations and thereby to establish the felicity of the world of\r\nmankind, it is impossible and impracticable--for example, the enforcement\r\nof the laws of the Torah and also of the other religions in accordance\r\nwith present imitations. But the essential basis of all the Divine\r\nReligions which pertains to the virtues of the world of mankind and is the\r\nfoundation of the welfare of the world of man, is found in the teachings\r\nof Baha'u'llah in the most perfect presentation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with regard to the peoples who clamour for freedom: the\r\nmoderate freedom which guarantees the welfare of the world of mankind and\r\nmaintains and preserves the universal relationships, is found in its\r\nfullest power and extension in the teachings of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nSo with regard to political parties: that which is the greatest policy\r\ndirecting the world of mankind, nay, rather, the Divine policy, is found\r\nin the teachings of Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\nLikewise with regard to the party of 'equality' which seeks the solution\r\nof the economic problems: until now all proposed solutions have proved\r\nimpracticable except the economic proposals in the teachings of\r\nBaha'u'llah which are practicable and cause no distress to society.\r\n\r\nSo with the other parties: when ye look deeply into this matter, ye will\r\ndiscover that the highest aims of those parties are found in the teachings\r\nof Baha'u'llah. These teachings constitute the all-inclusive power among\r\nall men and are practicable. But there are some teachings of the past,\r\nsuch as those of the Torah, which cannot be carried out at the present\r\nday. It is the same with the other religions and the tenets of the various\r\nsects and the different parties.\r\n\r\nFor example, the question of universal peace, about which Baha'u'llah says\r\nthat the Supreme Tribunal must be established: although the League of\r\nNations has been brought into existence, yet it is incapable of\r\nestablishing universal peace. But the Supreme Tribunal which Baha'u'llah\r\nhas described will fulfil this sacred task with the utmost might and\r\npower. And His plan is this: that the national assemblies of each country\r\nand nation--that is to say parliaments--should elect two or three persons\r\nwho are the choicest men of that nation, and are well informed concerning\r\ninternational laws and the relations between governments and aware of the\r\nessential needs of the world of humanity in this day. The number of these\r\nrepresentatives should be in proportion to the number of inhabitants of\r\nthat country. The election of these souls who are chosen by the national\r\nassembly, that is, the parliament, must be confirmed by the upper house,\r\nthe congress and the cabinet and also by the president or monarch so these\r\npersons may be the elected ones of all the nation and the government. From\r\namong these people the members of the Supreme Tribunal will be elected,\r\nand all mankind will thus have a share therein, for every one of these\r\ndelegates is fully representative of his nation. When the Supreme Tribunal\r\ngives a ruling on any international question, either unanimously or by\r\nmajority rule, there will no longer be any pretext for the plaintiff or\r\nground of objection for the defendant. In case any of the governments or\r\nnations, in the execution of the irrefutable decision of the Supreme\r\nTribunal, be negligent or dilatory, the rest of the nations will rise up\r\nagainst it, because all the governments and nations of the world are the\r\nsupporters of this Supreme Tribunal. Consider what a firm foundation this\r\nis! But by a limited and restricted League the purpose will not be\r\nrealized as it ought and should. This is the truth about the situation,\r\nwhich has been stated....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n228: O SERVANT OF THE THRESHOLD OF BAHA'U'LLAH! THY ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO Servant of the Threshold of Baha'u'llah! Thy letter dated 14 June 1920\r\nhath been received. A letter from some of the members of the Peace\r\nCommittee hath also been received and an answer hath been written to them.\r\nDeliver it to them.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this meeting is not what it is reputed to be and is\r\nunable to order and arrange affairs in the manner which is befitting and\r\nnecessary. However that may be, the matter in which they are engaged is\r\nnevertheless of the greatest importance. The meeting at The Hague should\r\nhave such power and influence that its word will have an effect on the\r\ngovernments and nations. Point out to the revered members gathered there\r\nthat the Hague Conference held before the war had as its President the\r\nEmperor of Russia, and its members were men of the greatest eminence.\r\nNevertheless this did not prevent such a terrible war. Now how will it be?\r\nFor in the future another war, fiercer than the last, will assuredly break\r\nout; verily, of this there is no doubt whatever. What can the Hague\r\nmeeting do?\r\n\r\nBut the fundamental principles laid down by Baha'u'llah are day by day\r\nspreading. Deliver the answer to their letter and express the greatest\r\nlove and kindness, and leave them to their own affairs. In any case they\r\nought to be pleased with you, and subject to their approval you may print\r\nand distribute that detailed epistle of mine which hath already been\r\ntranslated into English.\r\n\r\nAs to the Esperantists, associate with them. Whenever you find one with\r\ncapacity, convey to him the fragrances of Life. In all the meetings\r\nconverse about the teachings of Baha'u'llah, because this will be\r\neffective today in the western countries. And if they ask regarding your\r\nbelief in Baha'u'llah, you should reply that we consider Him as the\r\nforemost Teacher and Educator of the world in this age, and make clear,\r\nexplaining in detail, that these teachings regarding universal peace and\r\nother subjects were revealed by the pen of Baha'u'llah fifty years ago and\r\nhave already been published in Persia and India and spread abroad\r\nthroughout the whole world. In the beginning all were incredulous about\r\nthe idea of universal peace, considering it an impossibility. Further,\r\nspeak of the greatness of Baha'u'llah, of the events that took place in\r\nPersia and Turkey, of the astonishing influence that He exerted, of the\r\ncontents of the Epistles which He addressed to all the sovereigns, and of\r\ntheir fulfilment. Also speak of the spread of the Baha'i Cause. Associate\r\nwith the Committee of Universal Peace at The Hague as much as possible,\r\nshowing them every courtesy.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the Esperantists are receptive and thou art familiar\r\nwith and expert in their language. Communicate also with the Esperantists\r\nof Germany and other places. The literature which thou circulatest should\r\ndeal only with the teachings. The dissemination of other literature is at\r\npresent not advisable. My hope is that the divine confirmations may\r\ncontinually assist thee....\r\n\r\nGrieve not over the apathy and coldness of the Hague meeting. Put thy\r\ntrust in God. Our hope is that among the people the Esperanto language may\r\nhereafter have a powerful effect. Thou hast now sown the seed. Assuredly\r\nit will grow. Its growth dependeth upon God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n229: O SINCERE SERVANT OF THE TRUE ONE! I HEAR THOU ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO sincere servant of the True One! I hear thou art grieved and distressed\r\nat the happenings of the world and the vicissitudes of fortune. Wherefore\r\nthis fear and sorrow? The true lovers of the Abha Beauty, and they that\r\nhave quaffed the Cup of the Covenant fear no calamity, nor feel depressed\r\nin the hour of trial. They regard the fire of adversity as their garden of\r\ndelight, and the depth of the sea the expanse of heaven.\r\n\r\nThou who art neath the shelter of God, and under the shadow of the Tree of\r\nHis Covenant, why sorrow and repine? Rest thou assured and feel confident.\r\nObserve the written commandments of thy Lord with joy and peace, with\r\nearnestness and sincerity; and be thou the well-wisher of thy country and\r\nthy government. His grace shall assist thee at all times, His blessings\r\nshall be bestowed upon thee, and thy heart's desire shall be realized.\r\n\r\nBy the Ancient Beauty!--may my life be a sacrifice for His loved ones--Were\r\nthe friends to realize what a glorious sovereignty the Lord hath destined\r\nfor them in His Kingdom, surely they would be filled with ecstasy, would\r\nbehold themselves crowned with immortal glory and carried away with\r\ntransports of delight. Erelong it shall be made manifest how brilliantly\r\nthe light of His bountiful care and mercy hath shone upon His loved ones,\r\nand what a turbulent ocean hath been stirred in their hearts! Then will\r\nthey clamour and exclaim: Happy are we; let all the world rejoice!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n230: O RESPECTED PERSONAGE! THY SECOND LETTER DATED ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO respected personage! Thy second letter dated 19 December 1918 was\r\nreceived. It was the cause of great joy and gladness, for it showed thy\r\nfirmness and steadfastness in the Covenant and Testament and thy yearning\r\nto raise the call of the Kingdom of God. Today the call of the Kingdom is\r\nthe magnetic power which draweth to itself the world of mankind, for\r\ncapacity in men is great. Divine teachings constitute the spirit of this\r\nage, nay rather the sun of this age. Every soul must endeavour that the\r\nveils that cover men's eyes may be torn asunder and that instantly the sun\r\nmay be seen and that heart and sight may be illumined thereby.\r\n\r\nNow, through the aid and bounty of God, this power of guidance and this\r\nmerciful bestowal are found in thee. Arise, therefore, in the utmost Power\r\nthat thou mayest bestow spirit upon mouldering bones, give sight to the\r\nblind, balm and freshness to the depressed, and liveliness and grace to\r\nthe dispirited. Every lamp will eventually be extinguished save the lamp\r\nof the Kingdom, which increaseth day by day in splendour. Every call shall\r\nultimately weaken except the call to the Kingdom of God, which day unto\r\nday is raised. Every path shall finally be twisted except the road of the\r\nKingdom, which straighteneth day by day. Undoubtedly heavenly melody is\r\nnot to be measured with an earthly one, and artificial lights are not to\r\nbe compared with the heavenly Sun. Hence one must exert endeavour in\r\nwhatever is lasting and permanent so that one may more and more be\r\nillumined, strengthened and revived....\r\n\r\nI pray and supplicate the Divine Kingdom that thy father, mother and\r\nbrother may, through the light of guidance, enter the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n231: O THOU BLOSSOM ON THE TREE OF LIFE! HAPPY ART ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou blossom on the Tree of Life! Happy art thou to have girded thy\r\nloins in service; to have risen with all thy power in the promulgation of\r\nthe divine teachings, to have convened gatherings and to have striven for\r\nthe exaltation of the Word of God.\r\n\r\nIn this mortal world every important matter hath an end; and every\r\nremarkable achievement a termination; none having permanent existence. For\r\ninstance, consider how the important achievements of the ancient world\r\nhave been totally exterminated and not a trace remaineth therefrom save\r\nthe great Cause of the Kingdom of God, which hath no beginning and will\r\nhave no end. At most, it is only renewed. At the beginning of each renewal\r\nit commandeth no attention in the sight of the people, but when once\r\ndefinitely established, it will daily advance and in its daily exaltation\r\nwill reach the supreme heavens.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider the day of Christ, which was the day of the renewal\r\nof the Kingdom of God. The people of the world attached no importance to\r\nit and did not realize its significance to such an extent that the\r\nsepulchre of Christ remained lost and unknown for three hundred years,\r\nuntil the maidservant of God, Helen, the mother of Constantine arrived and\r\ndiscovered the sacred spot.\r\n\r\nMy purpose in all this is to show how unobservant are the people of the\r\nworld and how ignorant, and on the day of the establishment of the\r\nKingdom, they remain heedless and negligent.\r\n\r\nErelong the power of the Kingdom will encompass all the world and then\r\nthey will be awakened and will cry and lament over those who were\r\noppressed and martyred, and will sigh and moan. Such is the nature of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n232: AS TO PRESIDENT WILSON, THE FOURTEEN PRINCIPLES ...\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to President Wilson, the fourteen principles which he hath enunciated\r\nare mostly found in the teachings of Baha'u'llah and I therefore hope that\r\nhe will be confirmed and assisted. Now is the dawn of universal peace; my\r\nhope is that its morn will fully break, converting the gloom of war, of\r\nstrife and of wrangling among men into the light of union, of harmony and\r\nof affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n233: O YE FAITHFUL FRIENDS, O YE SINCERE SERVANTS OF ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO ye faithful friends, O ye sincere servants of Baha'u'llah! Now, in the\r\nmidwatches of the night, when eyes are closed in slumber and all have laid\r\ntheir heads upon the couch of rest and deep sleep, 'Abdu'l-Baha is wakeful\r\nwithin the precincts of the Hallowed Shrine and, in the ardour of his\r\ninvocation uttereth this, his prayer:\r\n\r\nO Thou kind and loving Providence! The east is astir and the west surgeth\r\neven as the eternal billows of the sea. The gentle breezes of holiness are\r\ndiffused and, from the Unseen Kingdom, the rays of the Orb of Truth shine\r\nforth resplendent. The anthems of divine unity are being chanted and the\r\nensigns of celestial might are waving. The angelic Voice is raised and,\r\neven as the roaring of the leviathan, soundeth the call to selflessness\r\nand evanescence. The triumphal cry Ya Baha'u'l-Abha resoundeth on every\r\nside, and the call Ya 'Aliyyu'l-A'la ringeth throughout all regions. No\r\nstir is there in the world save that of the Glory of the One Ravisher of\r\nHearts, and no tumult is there save the surging of the love of Him, the\r\nIncomparable, the Well-Beloved.\r\n\r\nThe beloved of the Lord, with their musk-scented breath, burn like bright\r\ncandles in every clime, and the friends of the All-Merciful, even as\r\nunfolding flowers, can be found in all regions. Not for a moment do they\r\nrest; they breathe not but in remembrance of Thee, and crave naught but to\r\nserve Thy Cause. In the meadows of truth they are as sweet-singing\r\nnightingales, and in the flower-garden of guidance they are even as\r\nbrightly-coloured blossoms. With mystic flowers they adorn the walks of\r\nthe Garden of Reality; as swaying cypresses they line the riverbanks of\r\nthe Divine Will. Above the horizon of being they shine as radiant stars;\r\nin the firmament of the world they gleam as resplendent orbs.\r\nManifestations of celestial grace are they, and daysprings of the light of\r\ndivine assistance.\r\n\r\nGrant, O Thou Loving Lord, that all may stand firm and steadfast, shining\r\nwith everlasting splendour, so that, at every breath, gentle breezes may\r\nblow from the bowers of Thy loving-kindness, that from the ocean of Thy\r\ngrace a mist may rise, that the kindly showers of Thy love may bestow\r\nfreshness, and the zephyr waft its perfume from the rose garden of divine\r\nunity.\r\n\r\nVouchsafe, O Best Beloved of the World, a ray from Thy Splendour. O\r\nWell-Beloved of mankind, shed upon us the light of Thy Countenance.\r\n\r\nO God Omnipotent, do Thou shield us and be our refuge and, O Lord of\r\nBeing, show forth Thy might and Thy dominion.\r\n\r\nO Thou loving Lord, the movers of sedition are in some regions astir and\r\nactive, and by night and day are inflicting a grievous wrong.\r\n\r\nEven as wolves, tyrants are lying in wait, and the wronged, innocent flock\r\nhath neither help nor succour. Hounds are on the trail of the gazelles of\r\nthe fields of divine unity, and the pheasant in the mountains of heavenly\r\nguidance is pursued by the ravens of envy.\r\n\r\nO Thou divine Providence, preserve and protect us! O Thou Who art our\r\nShield, save us and defend us! Keep us beneath Thy Shelter, and by Thy\r\nHelp save us from all ills. Thou art, indeed, the True Protector, the\r\nUnseen Guardian, the Celestial Preserver, and the Heavenly Loving Lord.\r\n\r\nO ye beloved of the Lord! On one side the standard of the One True God is\r\nunfurled and the Voice of the Kingdom raised. The Cause of God is\r\nspreading, and manifest in splendour are the wonders from on high. The\r\neast is illumined and the west perfumed; fragrant with ambergris is the\r\nnorth, and musk-scented the south.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the faithless wax in hate and rancour, ceaselessly\r\nstirring up grievous sedition and mischief. No day goeth by but someone\r\nraiseth the standard of revolt and spurreth his charger into the arena of\r\ndiscord. No hour passeth but the vile adder bareth its fangs and\r\nscattereth its deadly venom.\r\n\r\nThe beloved of the Lord are wrapped in utter sincerity and devotion,\r\nunmindful of this rancour and malice. Smooth and insidious are these\r\nsnakes, these whisperers of evil, artful in their craft and guile. Be ye\r\non your guard and ever wakeful! Quick-witted and keen of intellect are the\r\nfaithful, and firm and steadfast are the assured. Act ye with all\r\ncircumspection!\r\n\r\n'Fear ye the sagacity of the faithful, for he seeth with the divine\r\nlight!'\r\n\r\nBeware lest any soul privily cause disruption or stir up strife. In the\r\nImpregnable Stronghold be ye brave warriors, and for the Mighty Mansion a\r\nvaliant host. Exercise the utmost care, and day and night be on your\r\nguard, that thereby the tyrant may inflict no harm.\r\n\r\nStudy the Tablet of the Holy Mariner that ye may know the truth and\r\nconsider that the Blessed Beauty hath fully foretold future events. Let\r\nthem who perceive take warning. Verily in this is a bounty for the\r\nsincere!\r\n\r\nEven as dust upon the Sacred Threshold, in utter humility and lowliness,\r\n'Abdu'l-Baha is engaged in the promulgation of His signs in the daytime\r\nand in the night season. Whensoever he findeth time he prayeth ardently,\r\nand beseecheth Him tearfully and fervently, saying:\r\n\r\nO Thou divine Providence, pitiful are we, grant us Thy succour; homeless\r\nwanderers, give us Thy shelter; scattered, do Thou unite us; astray,\r\ngather us to Thy fold; bereft, do Thou bestow upon us a share and portion;\r\nathirst, lead us to the well-spring of Life; frail, strengthen us that we\r\nmay arise to help Thy Cause and offer ourselves as a living sacrifice in\r\nthe pathway of guidance.\r\n\r\nThe faithless, however, by day and night, openly and privily do their\r\nutmost to shake the foundations of the Cause, to root out the Blessed\r\nTree, to deprive this servant of service, to kindle secret sedition and\r\nstrife and to annihilate 'Abdu'l-Baha. Outwardly they appear as sheep, yet\r\ninwardly they are naught but ravening wolves. Sweet in words, they are but\r\nat heart a deadly poison.\r\n\r\nO ye beloved ones, guard the Cause of God! Let no sweetness of tongue\r\nbeguile you--nay, rather consider the motive of every soul, and ponder the\r\nthought he cherisheth. Be ye straightway mindful and on your guard. Avoid\r\nhim, yet be not aggressive! Refrain from censure and from slander, and\r\nleave him in the Hand of God. Upon you rest the Glory of Glories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n234: O THOU WHO ART ENRAPTURED BY THE SWEET BREATHINGS ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou who art enraptured by the sweet breathings of the Lord! I have\r\nnoted the contents of thine eloquent letter, and have learned that thou\r\nsheddest tears and thy heart is afire from grieving over the imprisonment\r\nof 'Abdu'l-Baha.\r\n\r\nO thou handmaid of God! This prison is sweeter to me and more to be\r\ndesired than a garden of flowers; to me, this bondage is better than the\r\nfreedom to go my way, and I find this narrow place more spacious than wide\r\nand open plains. Do not grieve over me. And should my Lord decree that I\r\nbe blessed with sweet martyrdom's cup, this would but mean receiving what\r\nI long for most.\r\n\r\nFear not if this Branch be severed from this material world and cast aside\r\nits leaves; nay, the leaves thereof shall flourish, for this Branch will\r\ngrow after it is cut off from this world below, it shall reach the\r\nloftiest pinnacles of glory, and it shall bear such fruits as will perfume\r\nthe world with their fragrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n235: O GOD, MY GOD! ILLUMINE THE BROWS OF THY TRUE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Illumine the brows of Thy true lovers and support them with\r\nangelic hosts of certain triumph. Set firm their feet on Thy straight\r\npath, and out of Thine ancient bounty open before them the portals of Thy\r\nblessings; for they are expending on Thy pathway what Thou hast bestowed\r\nupon them, safeguarding Thy Faith, putting their trust in their\r\nremembrance of Thee, offering up their hearts for love of Thee, and\r\nwithholding not what they possess in adoration for Thy Beauty and in their\r\nsearch for ways to please Thee.\r\n\r\nO my Lord! Ordain for them a plenteous share, a destined recompense and\r\nsure reward.\r\n\r\nVerily, Thou art the Sustainer, the Helper, the Generous, the Bountiful,\r\nthe Ever-Bestowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n236: O THOU, MY GOD, WHO GUIDEST THE SEEKER TO THE ...\r\n\r\n\r\nO Thou, my God, Who guidest the seeker to the pathway that leadeth aright,\r\nWho deliverest the lost and blinded soul out of the wastes of perdition,\r\nThou Who bestowest upon the sincere great bounties and favours, Who\r\nguardest the frightened within Thine impregnable refuge, Who answerest,\r\nfrom Thine all-highest horizon, the cry of those who cry out unto Thee.\r\nPraised be Thou, O my Lord! Thou hast guided the distracted out of the\r\ndeath of unbelief, and hast brought those who draw nigh unto Thee to the\r\njourney's goal, and hast rejoiced the assured among Thy servants by\r\ngranting them their most cherished desires, and hast, from Thy Kingdom of\r\nbeauty, opened before the faces of those who yearn after Thee the gates of\r\nreunion, and hast rescued them from the fires of deprivation and loss--so\r\nthat they hastened unto Thee and gained Thy presence, and arrived at Thy\r\nwelcoming door, and received of gifts an abundant share.\r\n\r\nO my Lord, they thirsted, Thou didst lift to their parched lips the waters\r\nof reunion. O Tender One, Bestowing One, Thou didst calm their pain with\r\nthe balm of Thy bounty and grace, and didst heal their ailments with the\r\nsovereign medicine of Thy compassion. O Lord, make firm their feet on Thy\r\nstraight path, make wide for them the needle's eye, and cause them,\r\ndressed in royal robes, to walk in glory for ever and ever.\r\n\r\nVerily art Thou the Generous, the Ever-Giving, the Precious, the Most\r\nBountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the\r\nExalted, the Victorious.\r\n\r\nO my spiritual loved ones! Praise be to God, ye have thrust the veils\r\naside and recognized the compassionate Beloved, and have hastened away\r\nfrom this abode to the placeless realm. Ye have pitched your tents in the\r\nworld of God, and to glorify Him, the Self-Subsistent, ye have raised\r\nsweet voices and sung songs that pierced the heart. Well done! A thousand\r\ntimes well done! For ye have beheld the Light made manifest, and in your\r\nreborn beings ye have raised the cry, 'Blessed be the Lord, the best of\r\nall creators!' Ye were but babes in the womb, then were ye sucklings, and\r\nfrom a precious breast ye drew the milk of knowledge, then came ye to your\r\nfull growth, and won salvation. Now is the time for service, and for\r\nservitude unto the Lord. Release yourselves from all distracting thoughts,\r\ndeliver the Message with an eloquent tongue, adorn your assemblages with\r\npraise of the Beloved, till bounty shall descend in overwhelming floods\r\nand dress the world in fresh greenery and blossoms. This streaming bounty\r\nis even the counsels, admonitions, instructions, and injunctions of\r\nAlmighty God.\r\n\r\nO ye my loved ones! The world is wrapped in the thick darkness of open\r\nrevolt and swept by a whirlwind of hate. It is the fires of malevolence\r\nthat have cast up their flames to the clouds of heaven, it is a\r\nblood-drenched flood that rolleth across the plains and down the hills,\r\nand no one on the face of the earth can find any peace. Therefore must the\r\nfriends of God engender that tenderness which cometh from Heaven, and\r\nbestow love in the spirit upon all humankind. With every soul must they\r\ndeal according to the Divine counsellings and admonitions; to all must\r\nthey show forth kindness and good faith; to all must they wish well. They\r\nmust sacrifice themselves for their friends, and wish good fortune to\r\ntheir foes. They must comfort the ill-natured, and treat their oppressors\r\nwith loving-kindness. They must be as refreshing water to the thirsty, and\r\nto the sick, a swift remedy, a healing balm to those in pain and a solace\r\nto every burdened heart. They must be a guiding light to those who have\r\ngone astray, a sure leader for the lost. They must be seeing eyes to the\r\nblind, hearing ears to the deaf, and to the dead eternal life, and to the\r\ndespondent joy forever.\r\n\r\nLet them willingly subject themselves to every just king, and to every\r\ngenerous ruler be good citizens. Let them obey the government and not\r\nmeddle in political affairs, but devote themselves to the betterment of\r\ncharacter and behaviour, and fix their gaze upon the Light of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n237: WHOSO RECITETH THIS PRAYER WITH LOWLINESS AND ...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoso reciteth this prayer with lowliness and fervour will bring gladness\r\nand joy to the heart of this Servant; it will be even as meeting Him face\r\nto face.\r\n\r\nHe is the All-Glorious!\r\n\r\nO God, my God! Lowly and tearful, I raise my suppliant hands to Thee and\r\ncover my face in the dust of that Threshold of Thine, exalted above the\r\nknowledge of the learned, and the praise of all that glorify Thee.\r\nGraciously look upon Thy servant, humble and lowly at Thy door, with the\r\nglances of the eye of Thy mercy, and immerse him in the Ocean of Thine\r\neternal grace.\r\n\r\nLord! He is a poor and lowly servant of Thine, enthralled and imploring\r\nThee, captive in Thy hand, praying fervently to Thee, trusting in Thee, in\r\ntears before Thy face, calling to Thee and beseeching Thee, saying:\r\n\r\nO Lord, my God! Give me Thy grace to serve Thy loved ones, strengthen me\r\nin my servitude to Thee, illumine my brow with the light of adoration in\r\nThy court of holiness, and of prayer to Thy Kingdom of grandeur. Help me\r\nto be selfless at the heavenly entrance of Thy gate, and aid me to be\r\ndetached from all things within Thy holy precincts. Lord! Give me to drink\r\nfrom the chalice of selflessness; with its robe clothe me, and in its\r\nocean immerse me. Make me as dust in the pathway of Thy loved ones, and\r\ngrant that I may offer up my soul for the earth ennobled by the footsteps\r\nof Thy chosen ones in Thy path, O Lord of Glory in the Highest.\r\n\r\nWith this prayer doth Thy servant call Thee, at dawntide and in the\r\nnight-season. Fulfil his heart's desire, O Lord! Illumine his heart,\r\ngladden his bosom, kindle his light, that he may serve Thy Cause and Thy\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nThou art the Bestower, the Pitiful, the Most Bountiful, the Gracious, the\r\nMerciful, the Compassionate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 Qur'an 60:13.\r\n\r\n    2 Matthew 22:14.\r\n\r\n    3 Qur'an 57:21.\r\n\r\n    4 Qur'an 17:81.\r\n\r\n    5 Qur'an 15:72.\r\n\r\n    6 Qur'an 39:68; Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 133.\r\n\r\n    7 Qur'an 74:8.\r\n\r\n    8 Qur'an 39:68.\r\n\r\n    9 Qur'an 79:6.\r\n\r\n   10 Qur'an 22:2.\r\n\r\n   11 Qur'an 34:39.\r\n\r\n   12 Qur'an 29:19.\r\n\r\n   13 Qur'an 79:34.\r\n\r\n   14 Qur'an 6:91; 52:12.\r\n\r\n   15 Napoleon III\r\n\r\n   16 Believed to be the angel appointed to sound the trumpet on the Day\r\n      of Resurrection to raise the dead at the bidding of the Lord.\r\n\r\n   17 Huququ'llah\r\n\r\n   18 Qur'an 6:103.\r\n\r\n   19 Qur'an 17:110.\r\n\r\n   20 John 14:11.\r\n\r\n   21 John 14:10.\r\n\r\n   22 Qur'an 6:91.\r\n\r\n   23 Written especially for Dr. Esslemont's immortal work Baha'u'llah and\r\n      the New Era.\r\n\r\n   24 John 6:51, 58.\r\n\r\n   25 cf.
