Showing that the system of the universe\r\n          originates in the Self, and that the continuation\r\n          of the life of all individuals\r\n          depends on strengthening the Self                      16\r\n\r\n     II. Showing that the life of the Self comes\r\n          from forming desires and bringing them\r\n          to birth                                               23\r\n\r\n    III.

A tale of which the moral is that negation\r\n          of the Self is a doctrine invented by the\r\n          subject races of mankind in order that by\r\n          this means they may sap and weaken the\r\n          character of their rulers                              48\r\n\r\n    VII. To the effect that Plato, whose thought\r\n          has deeply influenced the mysticism and\r\n          literature of Islam, followed the sheep’s\r\n          doctrine, and that we must be on our\r\n          guard against his theories                             56\r\n\r\n   VIII.

I read it\r\nsoon afterwards and thought so highly of it that I wrote to Iqbal,\r\nwhom I had the pleasure of meeting at Cambridge some fifteen years\r\nago, asking leave to prepare an English translation. My proposal was\r\ncordially accepted, but in the meantime I found other work to do,\r\nwhich caused the translation to be laid aside until last year. Before\r\nsubmitting it to the reader, a few remarks are necessary concerning the\r\npoem and its author.[1]\r\n\r\nIqbal is an Indian Moslem. During his stay in the West he studied\r\nmodern philosophy, in which subject he holds degrees from the\r\nUniversities of Cambridge and Munich. His dissertation on the\r\ndevelopment of metaphysics in Persia--an illuminating sketch--appeared\r\nas a book in 1908. Since then he has developed a philosophy of his\r\nown, on which I am able to give some extremely interesting notes\r\ncommunicated by himself. Of this, however, the _Asrár-i Khudí_ gives\r\nno systematic account, though it puts his ideas in a popular and\r\nattractive form. While the Hindu philosophers, in explaining the\r\ndoctrine of the unity of being, addressed themselves to the head,\r\nIqbal, like the Persian poets who teach the same doctrine, takes a\r\nmore dangerous course and aims at the heart. He is no mean poet, and\r\nhis verse can rouse or persuade even if his logic fail to convince.\r\nHis message is not for the Mohammedans of India alone, but for Moslems\r\neverywhere: accordingly he writes in Persian instead of Hindustani--a\r\nhappy choice, for amongst educated Moslems there are many familiar\r\nwith Persian literature, while the Persian language is singularly well\r\nadapted to express philosophical ideas in a style at once elevated and\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\nIqbal comes forward as an apostle, if not to his own age, then to\r\nposterity--\r\n\r\n  “I have no need of the ear of To-day,\r\n  I am the voice of the poet of To-morrow”--\r\n\r\nand after Persian fashion he invokes the Saki to fill his cup with wine\r\nand pour moonbeams into the dark night of his thought,\r\n\r\n  “That I may lead home the wanderer,\r\n  And imbue the idle looker-on with restless impatience,\r\n  And advance hotly on a new quest,\r\n  And become known as the champion of a new spirit.”\r\n\r\nLet us begin at the end. What is the far-off goal on which his eyes are\r\nfixed? The answer to that question will discover his true character,\r\nand we shall be less likely to stumble on the way if we see whither we\r\nare going. Iqbal has drunk deep of European literature, his philosophy\r\nowes much to Nietzsche and Bergson, and his poetry often reminds us of\r\nShelley; yet he thinks and feels as a Moslem, and just for this reason\r\nhis influence may be great. He is a religious enthusiast, inspired by\r\nthe vision of a New Mecca, a world-wide, theocratic, Utopian state\r\nin which all Moslems, no longer divided by the barriers of race and\r\ncountry, shall be one. He will have nothing to do with nationalism\r\nand imperialism. These, he says, “rob us of Paradise”: they make us\r\nstrangers to each other, destroy feelings of brotherhood, and sow the\r\nbitter seed of war. He dreams of a world ruled by religion, not by\r\npolitics, and condemns Machiavelli, that “worshipper of false gods,”\r\nwho has blinded so many. It must be observed that when he speaks of\r\nreligion he always means Islam. Non-Moslems are simply unbelievers,\r\nand (in theory, at any rate) the _Jihád_ is justifiable, provided that\r\nit is waged “for God’s sake alone.” A free and independent Moslem\r\nfraternity, having the Ka´ba as its centre and knit together by love\r\nof Allah and devotion to the Prophet--such is Iqbal’s ideal. In the\r\n_Asrár-i Khudí_ and the _Rumúz-i Békhudí_ he preaches it with a burning\r\nsincerity which we cannot but admire, and at the same time points out\r\nhow it may be attained. The former poem deals with the life of the\r\nindividual Moslem, the latter with the life of the Islamic community.\r\n\r\nThe cry “Back to the Koran! Back to Mohammed!” has been heard before,\r\nand the responses have hitherto been somewhat discouraging. But on\r\nthis occasion it is allied with the revolutionary force of Western\r\nphilosophy, which Iqbal hopes and believes will vitalise the movement\r\nand ensure its triumph. He sees that Hindu intellectualism and Islamic\r\npantheism have destroyed the capacity for action, based on scientific\r\nobservation and interpretation of phenomena, which distinguishes the\r\nWestern peoples “and especially the English.” Now, this capacity\r\ndepends ultimately on the conviction that _khudí_ (selfhood,\r\nindividuality, personality) is real and is not merely an illusion of\r\nthe mind. Iqbal, therefore, throws himself with all his might against\r\nidealistic philosophers and pseudo-mystical poets, the authors, in his\r\nopinion, of the decay prevailing in Islam, and argues that only by\r\nself-affirmation, self-expression, and self-development can the Moslems\r\nonce more become strong and free. He appeals from the alluring raptures\r\nof Hafiz to the moral fervour of Jalálu´ddín Rúmí, from an Islam sunk\r\nin Platonic contemplation to the fresh and vigorous monotheism which\r\ninspired Mohammed and brought Islam into existence.[2] Here, perhaps,\r\nI should guard against a possible misunderstanding. Iqbal’s philosophy\r\nis religious, but he does not treat philosophy as the handmaid\r\nof religion. Holding that the full development of the individual\r\npresupposes a society, he finds the ideal society in what he considers\r\nto be the Prophet’s conception of Islam. Every Moslem, in striving to\r\nmake himself a more perfect individual, is helping to establish the\r\nIslamic kingdom of God upon earth.[3]\r\n\r\nThe _Asrár-i Khudí_ is composed in the metre and modelled on the\r\nstyle of the famous _Masnaví_. In the prologue Iqbal relates how\r\nJalálu´ddín Rúmí, who is to him almost what Virgil was to Dante,\r\nappeared in a vision and bade him arise and sing. Much as he dislikes\r\nthe type of Súfism exhibited by Hafiz, he pays homage to the pure\r\nand profound genius of Jalálu´ddín, though he rejects the doctrine\r\nof self-abandonment taught by the great Persian mystic and does not\r\naccompany him in his pantheistic flights.\r\n\r\nTo European readers the _Asrár-i Khudí_ presents certain obscurities\r\nwhich no translation can entirely remove. These lie partly in the\r\nform and would not be felt, as a rule, by any one conversant with\r\nPersian poetry. Often, however, the ideas themselves, being associated\r\nwith peculiarly Oriental ways of thinking, are hard for our minds\r\nto follow. I am not sure that I have always grasped the meaning or\r\nrendered it correctly; but I hope that such errors are few, thanks to\r\nthe assistance so kindly given me by my friend Muhammad Shafi, now\r\nProfessor of Arabic at Lahore, with whom I read the poem and discussed\r\nmany points of difficulty. Other questions of a more fundamental\r\ncharacter have been solved for me by the author himself. At my request\r\nhe drew up a statement of his philosophical views on the problems\r\ntouched and suggested in the book. I will give it in his own words as\r\nnearly as possible, it is not, of course, a complete statement, and was\r\nwritten, as he says, “in a great hurry,” but apart from its power and\r\noriginality it elucidates the poetical argument far better than any\r\nexplanation that could have been offered by me.\r\n\r\n\r\n“1. THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF THE _ASRÁR-I KHUDÍ_\r\n\r\n“‘That experience should take place in finite centres and should wear\r\nthe form of finite this-ness is in the end inexplicable.’ These are the\r\nwords of Prof. Bradley. But starting with these inexplicable centres\r\nof experience, he ends in a unity which he calls Absolute and in which\r\nthe finite centres lose their finiteness and distinctness. According to\r\nhim, therefore, the finite centre is only an appearance. The test of\r\nreality, in his opinion, is all-inclusiveness; and since all finiteness\r\nis ‘infected with relativity,’ it follows that the latter is a mere\r\nillusion. To my mind, this inexplicable finite centre of experience is\r\nthe fundamental fact of the universe. All life is individual; there is\r\nno such thing as universal life. God himself is an individual: He is\r\nthe most unique individual.[4] The universe, as Dr. McTaggart says, is\r\nan association of individuals; but we must add that the orderliness\r\nand adjustment which we find in this association is not eternally\r\nachieved and complete in itself. It is the result of instinctive or\r\nconscious effort. We are gradually travelling from chaos to cosmos and\r\nare helpers in this achievement. Nor are the members of the association\r\nfixed; new members are ever coming to birth to co-operate in the great\r\ntask. Thus the universe is not a completed act: it is still in the\r\ncourse of formation. There can be no complete truth about the universe,\r\nfor the universe has not yet become ‘whole.’ The process of creation\r\nis still going on, and man too takes his share in it, inasmuch as he\r\nhelps to bring order into at least a portion of the chaos. The Koran\r\nindicates the possibility of other creators than God.[5]\r\n\r\n“Obviously, this view of man and the universe is opposed to that of\r\nthe English Neo-Hegelians as well as to all forms of pantheistic\r\nSúfism which regard absorption in a universal life or soul as the\r\nfinal aim and salvation of man.[6] The moral and religious ideal of\r\nman is not self-negation but self-affirmation, and he attains to this\r\nideal by becoming more and more individual, more and more unique. The\r\nProphet said, ‘_Takhallaqú bi-akhláq Allah_,’ ‘Create in yourselves\r\nthe attributes of God.’ Thus man becomes unique by becoming more\r\nand more like the most unique Individual. What then is life? It is\r\nindividual: its highest form, so far, is the Ego (_Khudí_) in which the\r\nindividual becomes a self-contained exclusive centre. Physically as\r\nwell as spiritually man is a self-contained centre, but he is not yet\r\na complete individual. The greater his distance from God, the less his\r\nindividuality. He who comes nearest to God is the completest person.\r\nNot that he is finally absorbed in God. On the contrary, he absorbs\r\nGod into himself.[7] The true person not only absorbs the world of\r\nmatter; by mastering it he absorbs God Himself into his Ego. Life is a\r\nforward assimilative movement. It removes all obstructions in its march\r\nby assimilating them. Its essence is the continual creation of desires\r\nand ideals, and for the purpose of its preservation and expansion it\r\nhas invented or developed out of itself certain instruments, _e.g._\r\nsenses, intellect, etc., which help it to assimilate obstructions.[8]\r\nThe greatest obstacle in the way of life is matter, Nature; yet Nature\r\nis not evil, since it enables the inner powers of life to unfold\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“The Ego attains to freedom by the removal of all obstructions in\r\nits way. It is partly free, partly determined,[9] and reaches fuller\r\nfreedom by approaching the Individual who is most free--God. In one\r\nword, life is an endeavour for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n“2. THE EGO AND CONTINUATION OF PERSONALITY\r\n\r\n“In man the centre of life becomes an Ego or Person. Personality is a\r\nstate of tension and can continue only if that state is maintained.\r\nIf the state of tension is not maintained, relaxation will ensue.\r\nSince personality, or the state of tension, is the most valuable\r\nachievement of man, he should see that he does not revert to a state of\r\nrelaxation. That which tends to maintain the state of tension tends to\r\nmake us immortal. Thus the idea of personality gives us a standard of\r\nvalue: it settles the problem of good and evil. That which fortifies\r\npersonality is good, that which weakens it is bad. Art,[10] religion,\r\nand ethics[11] must be judged from the standpoint of personality. My\r\ncriticism of Plato[12] is directed against those philosophical systems\r\nwhich hold up death rather than life as their ideal--systems which\r\nignore the greatest obstruction to life, namely, matter, and teach us\r\nto run away from it instead of absorbing it.\r\n\r\n“As in connexion with the question of the freedom of the Ego we have to\r\nface the problem of matter, similarly in connexion with its immortality\r\nwe have to face the problem of time.[13] Bergson has taught us that\r\ntime is not an infinite line (in the spatial sense of the word ‘line’)\r\nthrough which we must pass whether we wish it or not. This idea of\r\ntime is adulterated. Pure time has no length. Personal immortality is\r\nan aspiration: you can have it if you make an effort to achieve it.\r\nIt depends on our adopting in this life modes of thought and activity\r\nwhich tend to maintain the state of tension. Buddhism, Persian Súfism,\r\nand allied forms of ethics will not serve our purpose. But they are\r\nnot wholly useless, because after periods of great activity we need\r\nopiates, narcotics, for some time. These forms of thought and action\r\nare like nights in the days of life. Thus, if our activity is directed\r\ntowards the maintenance of a state of tension, the shock of death\r\nis not likely to affect it. After death there may be an interval of\r\nrelaxation, as the Koran speaks of a _barzakh_, or intermediate state,\r\nwhich lasts until the Day of Resurrection.[14] Only those Egos will\r\nsurvive this state of relaxation who have taken good care during the\r\npresent life. Although life abhors repetition in its evolution, yet on\r\nBergson’s principles the resurrection of the body too, as Wildon Carr\r\nsays, is quite possible. By breaking up time into moments we spatialise\r\nit and then find difficulty in getting over it. The true nature of\r\ntime is reached when we look into our deeper self.[15] Real time is\r\nlife itself, which can preserve itself by maintaining that particular\r\nstate of tension (personality) which it has so far achieved. We are\r\nsubject to time so long as we look upon time as something spatial.\r\nSpatialised time is a fetter which life has forged for itself in order\r\nto assimilate the present environment. In reality we are timeless, and\r\nit is possible to realise our timelessness even in this life. This\r\nrevelation, however, can be momentary only.\r\n\r\n\r\n“3. THE EDUCATION OF THE EGO\r\n\r\n“The Ego is fortified by love (_’ishq_).[16] This word is used in a\r\nvery wide sense and means the desire to assimilate, to absorb. Its\r\nhighest form is the creation of values and ideals and the endeavour to\r\nrealise them. Love individualises the lover as well as the beloved.\r\nThe effort to realise the most unique individuality individualises the\r\nseeker and implies the individuality of the sought, for nothing else\r\nwould satisfy the nature of the seeker. As love fortifies the Ego,\r\nasking (_su´ál_) weakens it.[17] All that is achieved without personal\r\neffort comes under _su´ál_. The son of a rich man who inherits his\r\nfather’s wealth is an ‘asker’ (beggar); so is every one who thinks\r\nthe thoughts of others. Thus, in order to fortify the Ego we should\r\ncultivate love, _i.e._ the power of assimilative action, and avoid all\r\nforms of ‘asking,’ _i.e._ inaction. The lesson of assimilative action\r\nis given by the life of the Prophet, at least to a Mohammedan.\r\n\r\n“In another part of the poem[18] I have hinted at the general\r\nprinciples of Moslem ethics and have tried to reveal their meaning in\r\nconnexion with the idea of personality. The Ego in its movement towards\r\nuniqueness has to pass through three stages:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Obedience to the Law.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Self-control, which is the highest form of self-consciousness\r\n        or Ego-hood.[19]\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Divine vicegerency.[20]\r\n\r\n“This (divine vicegerency, _niyábat-i iláhí_) is the third and last\r\nstage of human development on earth. The _ná´ib_ (vicegerent) is\r\nthe vicegerent of God on earth. He is the completest Ego, the goal\r\nof humanity,[21] the acme of life both in mind and body; in him the\r\ndiscord of our mental life becomes a harmony. The highest power is\r\nunited in him with the highest knowledge. In his life, thought and\r\naction, instinct and reason, become one. He is the last fruit of the\r\ntree of humanity, and all the trials of a painful evolution are\r\njustified because he is to come at the end. He is the real ruler\r\nof mankind; his kingdom is the kingdom of God on earth. Out of the\r\nrichness of his nature he lavishes the wealth of life on others, and\r\nbrings them nearer and nearer to himself. The more we advance in\r\nevolution, the nearer we get to him. In approaching him we are raising\r\nourselves in the scale of life. The development of humanity both in\r\nmind and body is a condition precedent to his birth. For the present\r\nhe is a mere ideal; but the evolution of humanity is tending towards\r\nthe production of an ideal race of more or less unique individuals who\r\nwill become his fitting parents. Thus the Kingdom of God on earth means\r\nthe democracy of more or less unique individuals, presided over by the\r\nmost unique individual possible on this earth. Nietzsche had a glimpse\r\nof this ideal race, but his atheism and aristocratic prejudices marred\r\nhis whole conception.”[22]\r\n\r\nEvery one, I suppose, will acknowledge that the substance of the\r\n_Asrár-i Khudí_ is striking enough to command attention. In the poem,\r\nnaturally, this philosophy presents itself under a different aspect.\r\nIts audacity of thought and phrase is less apparent, its logical\r\nbrilliancy dissolves in the glow of feeling and imagination, and it\r\nwins the heart before taking possession of the mind. The artistic\r\nquality of the poem is remarkable when we consider that its language\r\nis not the author’s own. I have done my best to preserve as much of\r\nthis as a literal prose translation would allow. Many passages of\r\nthe original are poetry of the kind that, once read, is not easily\r\nforgotten, _e.g._ the description of the Ideal Man as a deliverer for\r\nwhom the world is waiting, and the noble invocation which brings the\r\nbook to an end. Like Jalálu´ddín Rúmí, Iqbal is fond of introducing\r\nfables and apologues to relieve the argument and illustrate his meaning\r\nwith more force and point than would be possible otherwise.\r\n\r\nOn its first appearance the _Asrár-i Khudí_ took by storm the younger\r\ngeneration of Indian Moslems. “Iqbal,” wrote one of them, “has come\r\namongst us as a Messiah and has stirred the dead with life.” It remains\r\nto be seen in what direction the awakened ones will march. Will they\r\nbe satisfied with a glorious but distant vision of the City of God, or\r\nwill they adapt the new doctrine to other ends than those which its\r\nauthor has in view? Notwithstanding that he explicitly denounces the\r\nidea of nationalism, his admirers are already protesting that he does\r\nnot mean what he says.\r\n\r\nHow far the influence of his work may ultimately go I will not attempt\r\nto prophesy. It has been said of him that “he is a man of his age and\r\na man in advance of his age; he is also a man in disagreement with\r\nhis age.” We cannot regard his ideas as typical of any section of his\r\nco-religionists. They involve a radical change in the Moslem mind, and\r\ntheir real importance is not to be measured by the fact that such a\r\nchange is unlikely to occur within a calculable time.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The present translation follows the text of the second edition.\r\n\r\n[2] His criticism of Hafiz called forth angry protests from Súfí\r\ncircles in which Hafiz is venerated as a master-hierophant. Iqbal made\r\nno recantation, but since the passage had served its purpose and was\r\noffensive to many, he cancelled it in the second edition of the poem.\r\nIt is omitted in my translation.\r\n\r\n[3] The principles of Islam, regarded as the ideal society, are set\r\nforth in the author’s second poem, the _Rumúz-i Békhudí_ or “Mysteries\r\nof Selflessness.” He explains the title by pointing out that the\r\nindividual who loses himself in the community reflects both the past\r\nand the future as in a mirror, so that he transcends mortality and\r\nenters into the life of Islam, which is infinite and everlasting. Among\r\nthe topics discussed are the origin of society, the divine guidance of\r\nman through the prophets, the formation of collective life-centres, and\r\nthe value of History as a factor in maintaining the sense of personal\r\nidentity in a people.\r\n\r\n[4] This view was held by the orthodox Imám Ahmad ibn Hanbal in its\r\nextreme (anthropomorphic) form.\r\n\r\n[5] Kor. ch. 23, v. 14: “Blessed is God, the best of those who create.”\r\n\r\n[6] Cf. his note on “Islam and Mysticism” (_The New Era_, 1916, p. 250).\r\n\r\n[7] Here Iqbal adds: “Mauláná Rúmí has very beautifully expressed this\r\nidea. The Prophet, when a little boy, was once lost in the desert. His\r\nnurse Halíma was almost beside herself with grief, but while roaming\r\nthe desert in search of the boy she heard a voice saying:\r\n\r\n  ‘Do not grieve, he will not be lost to thee;\r\n  Nay, the whole world will be lost in him.’\r\n\r\nThe true individual cannot be lost in the world; it is the world that\r\nis lost in him. I go a step further and say, prefixing a new half-verse\r\nto a hemistich of Rúmí (Transl. l. 1325):\r\n\r\n  In his will that which God wills becomes lost:\r\n  ‘How shall a man believe this saying?’”\r\n\r\n[8] Transl. l. 289 foll.\r\n\r\n[9] According to the Tradition, “The true Faith is between\r\npredestination and freewill.”\r\n\r\n[10] Transl. l. 673 foll. In a note on “Our Prophet’s criticism of\r\ncontemporary Arabian poetry” (_The New Era_, 1916, p. 251) Iqbal\r\nwrites: “The ultimate end of all human activity is Life--glorious,\r\npowerful, exuberant. All human art must be subordinated to this final\r\npurpose, and the value of everything must be determined in reference to\r\nits life-yielding capacity. The highest art is that which awakens our\r\ndormant will-force and nerves us to face the trials of life manfully.\r\nAll that brings drowsiness and makes us shut our eyes to Reality\r\naround, on the mastery of which alone Life depends, is a message of\r\ndecay and death. There should be no opium-eating in Art. The dogma of\r\nArt for the sake of Art is a clever invention of decadence to cheat us\r\nout of life and power.”\r\n\r\n[11] _Ibid._ l. 537 foll.\r\n\r\n[12] _Ibid._ l. 631 foll.\r\n\r\n[13] _Ibid._ l. 1531 foll.\r\n\r\n[14] Kor. ch. 23, v. 102.\r\n\r\n[15] Transl. l. 1549 foll.\r\n\r\n[16] _Ibid._ l. 323 foll.\r\n\r\n[17] _Ibid._ l. 435 foll.\r\n\r\n[18] _Ibid._ l. 815 foll.\r\n\r\n[19] _Ibid._ l. 849 foll.\r\n\r\n[20] _Ibid._ l. 893 foll.\r\n\r\n[21] Man already possesses the germ of vicegerency, as God says in the\r\nKoran (ch. 2, v. 28): “Lo, I will appoint a _khalifa_ (vicegerent) on\r\nthe earth.” Cf. Transl. l. 434.\r\n\r\n[22] Writing of “Muslim Democracy” in _The New Era_, 1916, p. 251,\r\nIqbal says: “The Democracy of Europe--overshadowed by socialistic\r\nagitation and anarchical fear--originated mainly in the economic\r\nregeneration of European societies. Nietzsche, however, abhors this\r\n‘rule of the herd’ and, hopeless of the plebeian, he bases all higher\r\nculture on the cultivation and growth of an Aristocracy of Supermen.\r\nBut is the plebeian so absolutely hopeless? The Democracy of Islam\r\ndid not grow out of the extension of economic opportunity; it is a\r\nspiritual principle based on the assumption that every human being is a\r\ncentre of latent power, the possibilities of which can be developed by\r\ncultivating a certain type of character. Out of the plebeian material\r\nIslam has formed men of the noblest type of life and power. Is not,\r\nthen, the Democracy of early Islam an experimental refutation of the\r\nideas of Nietzsche?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the world-illuming sun rushed upon Night like a brigand,\r\n  My weeping bedewed the face of the rose.\r\n  My tears washed away sleep from the eye of the narcissus,\r\n  My passion wakened the grass and made it grow.\r\n  The Gardener taught me to sing with power,                         5\r\n  He sowed a verse and reaped a sword.\r\n  In the soil he planted only the seed of my tears\r\n  And wove my lament with the garden, as warp and woof.\r\n  Tho’ I am but a mote, the radiant sun is mine:\r\n  Within my bosom are a hundred dawns.                              10\r\n  My dust is brighter than Jamshíd’s cup,[23]\r\n  It knows things that are yet unborn in the world.\r\n  My thought hunted down and slung from the saddle a deer\r\n  That has not yet leaped forth from the covert of\r\n      non-existence.\r\n  Fair is my garden ere yet the leaves are green:                   15\r\n  Full-blown roses are hidden in the skirt of my garment.\r\n  I struck dumb the musicians where they were gathered\r\n      together,\r\n  I smote the heartstrings of all that heard me,\r\n  Because the lute of my genius hath a rare melody:\r\n  Even to comrades my song is strange.                              20\r\n  I am born in the world as a new sun,\r\n  I have not learned the ways and fashions of the sky:\r\n  Not yet have the stars fled before my splendour,\r\n  Not yet is my quicksilver astir;\r\n  Untouched is the sea by my dancing rays,                          25\r\n  Untouched are the mountains by my crimson hue.\r\n  The eye of existence is not familiar with me;\r\n  I rise trembling, afraid to show myself.\r\n  From the East my dawn arrived and routed Night,\r\n  A fresh dew settled on the rose of the world.                     30\r\n  I am waiting for the votaries that rise at dawn:\r\n  Oh, happy they who shall worship my fire!\r\n  I have no need of the ear of To-day,\r\n  I am the voice of the poet of To-morrow.\r\n  My own age does not understand my deep meanings,                  35\r\n  My Joseph is not for this market.\r\n  I despair of my old companions,\r\n  My Sinai burns for sake of the Moses who is coming.\r\n  Their sea is silent, like dew,\r\n  But my dew is storm-ridden, like the ocean.                       40\r\n  My song is of another world than theirs:\r\n  This bell calls other travellers to take the road.\r\n  How many a poet after his death\r\n  Opened our eyes when his own were closed,\r\n  And journeyed forth again from nothingness                        45\r\n  When roses blossomed o’er the earth of his grave!\r\n  Albeit caravans have passed through this desert,\r\n  They passed, as a camel steps, with little sound.\r\n  But I am a lover: loud crying is my faith:\r\n  The clamour of Judgement Day is one of my minions.                50\r\n  My song exceeds the range of the chord,\r\n  Yet I do not fear that my lute will break.\r\n  ‘Twere better for the waterdrop not to know my torrent,\r\n  Whose fury should rather madden the sea.\r\n  No river will contain my Omán:[24]                                55\r\n  My flood requires whole seas to hold it.\r\n  Unless the bud expand into a bed of roses,\r\n  It is unworthy of my spring-cloud’s bounty.\r\n  Lightnings slumber within my soul,\r\n  I sweep over mountain and plain.                                  60\r\n  Wrestle with my sea, if thou art a plain;\r\n  Receive my lightning, if thou art a Sinai.\r\n  The Fountain of Life hath been given me to drink,\r\n  I have been made an adept of the mystery of Life.\r\n  The speck of dust was vitalised by my burning song:               65\r\n  It unfolded wings and became a firefly.\r\n  No one hath told the secret which I will tell\r\n  Or threaded a pearl of thought like mine.\r\n  Come, if thou would’st know the secret of everlasting life!\r\n  Come, if thou would’st win both earth and heaven!                 70\r\n  The old Guru of the Sky taught me this lore,\r\n  I cannot hide it from my comrades.\r\n\r\n  O Saki! arise and pour wine into the cup,\r\n  Clear the vexation of Time from my heart!\r\n  The sparkling liquor that flows from Zemzem--[25]                 75\r\n  Were it a beggar, a king would pay homage to it.\r\n  It makes thought more sober and wise,\r\n  It makes the keen eye keener,\r\n  It gives to a straw the weight of a mountain,\r\n  And to foxes the strength of lions.                               80\r\n  It causes dust to soar to the Pleiades\r\n  And a drop of water swell to the breadth of the sea.\r\n  It turns silence into the din of Judgement Day,\r\n  It makes the foot of the partridge red with blood of the\r\n      hawk.\r\n  Arise and pour pure wine into my cup,                             85\r\n  Pour moonbeams into the dark night of my thought,\r\n  That I may lead home the wanderer\r\n  And imbue the idle looker-on with restless impatience;\r\n  And advance hotly on a new quest\r\n  And become known as the champion of a new spirit;                 90\r\n  And be to people of insight as the pupil to the eye,\r\n  And sink into the ear of the world, like a voice;\r\n  And exalt the worth of Poesy\r\n  And sprinkle the dry herbs with my tears.\r\n  Inspired by the genius of the Master of Rúm,[26]                  95\r\n  I rehearse the sealed book of secret lore.\r\n  His soul is the source of the flames,\r\n  I am but as the spark that gleams for a moment.\r\n  His burning candle consumed me, the moth;\r\n  His wine overwhelmed my goblet.                                  100\r\n  The Master of Rúm transmuted my earth to gold\r\n  And clothed my barren dust with beauty.\r\n  The grain of sand set forth from the desert,\r\n  That it might win the radiance of the sun.\r\n  I am a wave and I will come to rest in his sea,                  105\r\n  That I may make the glistening pearl mine own.\r\n  I who am drunken with the wine of his song\r\n  Will draw life from the breath of his words.\r\n\r\n  ‘Twas night: my heart would fain lament,\r\n  The silence was filled with my cries to God.                     110\r\n  I was complaining of the sorrows of the world\r\n  And bewailing the emptiness of my cup.\r\n  At last mine eye could endure no more,\r\n  Broken with fatigue it went to sleep.\r\n  There appeared the Master, formed in the mould of Truth,         115\r\n  Who wrote the Koran of Persia.[27]\r\n  He said, “O frenzied lover,\r\n  Take a draught of love’s pure wine.\r\n  Strike the chords of thine heart and rouse a tumultuous\r\n      strain,\r\n  Dash thine head against the cupping-glass and thine eye\r\n      against the lancet!

strengthened by Love._[36]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The luminous point whose name is the Self\r\n  Is the life-spark beneath our dust.\r\n  By Love it is made more lasting,                                 325\r\n  More living, more burning, more glowing.\r\n  From Love proceeds the radiance of its being\r\n  And the development of its unknown possibilities.\r\n  Its nature gathers fire from Love,\r\n  Love instructs it to illumine the world.                         330\r\n  Love fears neither sword nor dagger,\r\n  Love is not born of water and air and earth.\r\n  Love makes peace and war in the world,\r\n  The Fountain of Life is Love’s flashing sword.\r\n  The hardest rocks are shivered by Love’s glance:                 335\r\n  Love of God at last becomes wholly God.\r\n  Learn thou to love, and seek to be loved:\r\n  Seek an eye like Noah’s, a heart like Job’s!\r\n  Transmute thy handful of earth into gold,\r\n  Kiss the threshold of a Perfect Man![37]                         340\r\n  Like Rúmí, light thy candle\r\n  And burn Rúm in the fire of Tabríz![38]\r\n  There is a beloved hidden within thine heart:\r\n  I will show him to thee, if thou hast eyes to see.\r\n  His lovers are fairer than the fair,                             345\r\n  Sweeter and comelier and more beloved.\r\n  By love of him the heart is made strong\r\n  And earth rubs shoulders with the Pleiades.\r\n  The soil of Najd was quickened by his grace\r\n  And fell into a rapture and rose to the skies.[39]               350\r\n  In the Moslem’s heart is the home of Mohammed,\r\n  All our glory is from the name of Mohammed.\r\n  Sinai is but an eddy of the dust of his house,\r\n  The sanctuary of the Ka’ba is his dwelling-place.\r\n  Eternity is less than a moment of his time,                      355\r\n  Eternity receives increase from his essence.\r\n  He slept on a mat of rushes,\r\n  But the crown of Chosroes was under his people’s feet.\r\n  He chose the nightly solitude of Mount Hirá,\r\n  And he founded a state and laws and government.                  360\r\n  He passed many a night with sleepless eyes\r\n  In order that the Moslems might sleep on the throne of\r\n      Persia.\r\n  In the hour of battle, iron was melted by his sword;\r\n  In the hour of prayer, tears fell like rain from his eye.\r\n  When he was called to aid, his sword answered “Amen”             365\r\n  And extirpated the race of kings.\r\n  He instituted new laws in the world,\r\n  He brought the empires of antiquity to an end.\r\n  With the key of religion he opened the door of this world:\r\n  The womb of the world never bore his like.                       370\r\n  In his sight high and low were one,\r\n  He sat with his slave at one table.\r\n  The daughter of the chieftain of Tai was taken prisoner in\r\n      battle[40]\r\n  And brought into that exalted presence;\r\n  Her feet in chains, unveiled,                                    375\r\n  And her neck bowed with shame.\r\n  When the Prophet saw that the poor girl had no veil,\r\n  He covered her face with his own veil.\r\n  We are more naked than that lady of Tai,\r\n  We are unveiled before the nations of the world.                 380\r\n  In him is our trust on the Day of Judgement,\r\n  And in this world too he is our protector.\r\n  Both his favour and his wrath are entirely a mercy:\r\n  That is a mercy to his friends and this to his foes.\r\n  He opened the gates of mercy to his enemies,                     385\r\n  He gave to Mecca the message, “No blame shall be laid upon\r\n      you.”\r\n  We who know not the bonds of country\r\n  Resemble sight, which is one though it be the light of two\r\n      eyes.\r\n  We belong to the Hijáz and China and Persia,\r\n  Yet we are the dew of one smiling dawn.                          390\r\n  We are all under the spell of the eye of the cupbearer from\r\n      Mecca,\r\n  We are united as wine and cup.\r\n  He burnt clean away distinctions of lineage,\r\n  His fire consumed this trash and rubble.\r\n  We are like a rose with many petals but with one perfume:        395\r\n  He is the soul of this society, and he is one.\r\n  We were the secret concealed in his heart:\r\n  He spake out fearlessly, and we were revealed.\r\n  The song of love for him fills my silent reed,\r\n  A hundred notes throb in my bosom.                               400\r\n  How shall I tell what devotion he inspires?\r\n  A block of dry wood wept at parting from him.[41]\r\n  The Moslem’s being is where he manifests his glory:\r\n  Many a Sinai springs from the dust on his path.\r\n  My image was created by his mirror,                              405\r\n  My dawn rises from the sun of his breast.\r\n  My repose is a perpetual fever,\r\n  My evening hotter than the morning of Judgement Day:[42]\r\n  He is the April cloud and I his garden,\r\n  My vine is bedewed with his rain.                                410\r\n  I sowed mine eye in the field of Love\r\n  And reaped a harvest of delight.\r\n  “The soil of Medina is sweeter than both worlds:\r\n  Oh, happy the town where dwells the Beloved!”[43]\r\n  I am lost in admiration of the style of Mullá Jámí:              415\r\n  His verse and prose are a remedy for my immaturity.\r\n  He has written poetry overflowing with beautiful ideas\r\n  And has threaded pearls in praise of the Master--\r\n  “Mohammed is the preface to the book of the universe:\r\n  All the world are slaves and he is the Master.”                  420\r\n  From the wine of Love spring many qualities:\r\n  Amongst the attributes of Love is blind devotion.\r\n  The saint of Bistám, who in devotion was unique,\r\n  Abstained from eating a water-melon.[44]\r\n  Be a lover constant in devotion to thy beloved,                  425\r\n  That thou mayst cast thy noose and capture God.\r\n  Sojourn for a while on the Hirá of the heart,[45]\r\n  Abandon self and flee to God.\r\n  Strengthened by God, return to thy self\r\n  And break the heads of the Lát and Uzzá of sensuality.[46]       430\r\n  By the might of Love evoke an army,\r\n  Reveal thyself on the Fárán of Love,[47]\r\n  That the Lord of the Ka’ba may show thee favour\r\n  And interpret to thee the text, “Lo, I will appoint a\r\n      vicegerent on the earth.”[48]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] For the sense which Iqbal attaches to

is a doctrine\r\ninvented by the subject races of mankind in order that by this means\r\nthey may sap and weaken the character of their rulers._\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hast thou heard that in the time of old\r\n  The sheep dwelling in a certain pasture\r\n  So increased and multiplied\r\n  That they feared no enemy?                                       540\r\n  At last, from the malice of Fate,\r\n  Their breasts were smitten by a shaft of calamity.\r\n  The tigers sprang forth from the jungle\r\n  And rushed upon the sheepfold.\r\n  Conquest and dominion are signs of strength,                     545\r\n  Victory is the manifestation of strength.\r\n  Those fierce tigers beat the drum of sovereignty,\r\n  They deprived the sheep of freedom.\r\n  Forasmuch as tigers must have their prey,\r\n  That meadow was crimsoned with the blood of the sheep.           550\r\n  One of the sheep which was clever and acute,\r\n  Old in years, cunning as a weather-beaten wolf,\r\n  Being grieved at the fate of his fellows\r\n  And sorely vexed by the violence of the tigers,\r\n  Made complaint of the course of Destiny                          555\r\n  And sought by craft to restore his fortunes.\r\n  The weak man, in order to preserve himself,\r\n  Seeks devices from skilled intelligence.\r\n  In slavery, for the sake of repelling harm,\r\n  The power of scheming becomes quickened,                         560\r\n  And when the madness of revenge gains hold,\r\n  The mind of the slave meditates rebellion.\r\n  “Ours is a hard knot,” said this sheep to himself,\r\n  “The ocean of our griefs hath no shore.\r\n  By force we sheep cannot escape from the tiger:                  565\r\n  Our legs are silver, his paws are steel.\r\n  ‘Tis not possible, however much one exhorts and counsels,\r\n  To create in a sheep the disposition of a wolf.\r\n  But to make the furious tiger a sheep--that is possible;\r\n  To make him unmindful of his nature--that is possible.”          570\r\n  He became as a prophet inspired,\r\n  And began to preach to the bloodthirsty tigers.\r\n  He cried out, “O ye insolent liars,\r\n  Who wot not of a day of ill luck that shall continue for\r\n      ever![54]\r\n  I am possessed of spiritual power,                               575\r\n  I am an apostle sent by God for the tigers.\r\n  I come as a light for the eye that is dark,\r\n  I come to establish laws and give commandments.\r\n  Repent of your blameworthy deeds!\r\n  O plotters of evil, bethink yourselves of good!                  580\r\n  Whoso is violent and strong is miserable:\r\n  Life’s solidity depends on self-denial.\r\n  The spirit of the righteous is fed by fodder:\r\n  The vegetarian is pleasing unto God.\r\n  The sharpness of your teeth brings disgrace upon you             585\r\n  And makes the eye of your perception blind.\r\n  Paradise is for the weak alone,\r\n  Strength is but a means to perdition.\r\n  It is wicked to seek greatness and glory,\r\n  Penury is sweeter than princedom.                                590\r\n  Lightning does not threaten the corn-seed:\r\n  If the seed become a stack, it is unwise.\r\n  If you are sensible, you will be a mote of sand, not a\r\n      Sahara,\r\n  So that you may enjoy the sunbeams.\r\n  O thou that delightest in the slaughter of sheep,                595\r\n  Slay thy self, and thou wilt have honour!\r\n  Life is rendered unstable\r\n  By violence, oppression, revenge, and exercise of power.\r\n  Though trodden underfoot, the grass grows up time after time\r\n  And washes the sleep of death from its eye again and again.      600\r\n  Forget thy self, if thou art wise!\r\n  If thou dost not forget thy self, thou art mad.\r\n  Close thine eyes, close thine ears, close thy lips,[55]\r\n  That thy thought may reach the lofty sky!\r\n  This pasturage of the world is naught, naught:                   605\r\n  O fool, do not torment thyself for a phantom!”\r\n  The tiger-tribe was exhausted by hard struggles,\r\n  They had set their hearts on enjoyment of luxury.\r\n  This soporific advice pleased them,\r\n  In their stupidity they swallowed the charm of the sheep.        610\r\n  He that used to make sheep his prey\r\n  Now embraced a sheep’s religion.\r\n  The tigers took kindly to a diet of fodder:\r\n  At length their tigerish nature was broken.\r\n  The fodder blunted their teeth                                   615\r\n  And put out the awful flashings of their eyes.\r\n  By degrees courage ebbed from their breasts,\r\n  The sheen departed from the mirror.\r\n  That frenzy of uttermost exertion remained not,\r\n  That craving after action dwelt in their hearts no more.         620\r\n  They lost the power of ruling and the resolution to be\r\n      independent,\r\n  They lost reputation, prestige, and fortune.\r\n  Their paws that were as iron became strengthless;\r\n  Their souls died and their bodies became tombs.\r\n  Bodily strength diminished while spiritual fear increased:       625\r\n  Spiritual fear robbed them of courage.\r\n  Lack of courage produced a hundred diseases--\r\n  Poverty, pusillanimity, lowmindedness.\r\n  The wakeful tiger was lulled to slumber by the sheep’s charm:\r\n  He called his decline Moral Culture.                             630\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] These expressions are borrowed from the Koran.\r\n\r\n[55] Quoted

must be on our guard against his theories._[56]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Plato, the prime ascetic and sage,\r\n  Was one of that ancient flock of sheep.\r\n  His Pegasus went astray in the darkness of philosophy\r\n  And galloped over the mountains of Being.\r\n  He was so fascinated by the Ideal                                635\r\n  That he made head, eye, and ear of no account.\r\n  “To die,” said he, “is the secret of Life:\r\n  The candle is glorified by being put out.”\r\n  He dominates our thinking,\r\n  His cup sends us to sleep and takes the world away from us.      640\r\n  He is a sheep in man’s clothing,\r\n  The soul of the Súfí bows to his authority.\r\n  He soared with his intellect to the highest heaven,\r\n  He called the world of phenomena a myth.\r\n  ‘Twas his work to dissolve the structure of Life                 645\r\n  And cut the bough of Life’s fair tree asunder.\r\n  The thought of Plato regarded loss as profit,\r\n  His philosophy declared that being is not-being.\r\n  His nature drowsed and created a dream,\r\n  His mind’s eye created a mirage.                                 650\r\n  Since he was without any taste for action,\r\n  His soul was enraptured by the non-existent.\r\n  He disbelieved in the material universe\r\n  And became the creator of invisible Ideas.\r\n  Sweet is the world of phenomena to the living spirit,            655\r\n  Dear is the world of Ideas to the dead spirit:\r\n  Its gazelles have no grace of movement,\r\n  Its partridges are denied the pleasure of walking daintily.\r\n  Its dewdrops are unable to quiver,\r\n  Its birds have no breath in their breasts,                       660\r\n  Its seed does not desire to grow,\r\n  Its moths do not know how to flutter.\r\n  Our philosopher had no remedy but flight:\r\n  He could not endure the noise of this world.\r\n  He set his heart on the glow of a quenched flame                 665\r\n  And depicted a world steeped in opium.\r\n  He spread his wings towards the sky\r\n  And never came down to his nest again.\r\n  His phantasy is sunk in the jar of heaven:\r\n  I know not whether it is the dregs or the bricks. [57]           670\r\n  The peoples were poisoned by his intoxication:\r\n  He slumbered and took no delight in deeds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] The direct influence of Platonism on Moslem thought has been\r\ncomparatively slight. When the Moslems began to study Greek philosophy,\r\nthey turned to Aristotle. The genuine writings of Aristotle, however,\r\nwere not accessible to them. They studied translations of books passing\r\nunder his name, which were the work of Neoplatonists, so that what\r\nthey believed to be Aristotelian doctrine was in fact the philosophy\r\nof Plotinus, Proclus, and the later Neoplatonic school. Indirectly,\r\ntherefore, Plato has profoundly influenced the intellectual and\r\nspiritual development of Islam and may be called, if not the father of\r\nMohammedan mysticism, at any rate its presiding genius.\r\n\r\n[57] _I.e._ it is worthless in either case.

               675\r\n  So that Life leaps to its feet and marches briskly on.\r\n  Life is occupied with conquest alone,\r\n  And the one charm for conquest is desire.\r\n  Life is the hunter and desire the snare,\r\n  Desire is Love’s message to Beauty.                              680\r\n  Wherefore doth desire swell continuously\r\n  The bass and treble of Life’s song?\r\n  Whatsoever is good and fair and beautiful\r\n  Is our guide in the wilderness of seeking.\r\n  Its image becomes impressed on thine heart,                      685\r\n  It creates desires in thine heart.\r\n  Beauty is the creator of desire’s springtide,\r\n  Desire is nourished by the display of Beauty.\r\n  ‘Tis in the poet’s breast that Beauty unveils,\r\n  ‘Tis from his Sinai that Beauty’s beams arise.

brightened the cheek of the rose.\r\n  ‘Tis his passion burns in the heart of the moth,                 695\r\n  ‘Tis he that lends glowing hues to love-tales.\r\n  Sea and land are hidden within his water and clay,[58]\r\n  A hundred new worlds are concealed in his heart.\r\n  Ere tulips blossomed in his brain\r\n  There was heard no note of joy or grief.                         700\r\n  His music breathes o’er us a wonderful enchantment,\r\n  His pen draws a mountain with a single hair.\r\n  His thoughts dwell with the moon and the stars,\r\n  He creates beauty in that which is ugly and

tears.\r\n  Heavily we go, like raw novices,\r\n  Stumbling on the way to the goal.\r\n  His nightingale hath played a tune\r\n  And laid a plot to beguile us, 710\r\n  That he may lead us into Life’s Paradise,\r\n  And that Life’s bow may become a full circle.\r\n  Caravans march at the sound of his bell\r\n  And follow the voice of his pipe;\r\n  But when his zephyr blows in our gardens,                        715\r\n  We stay loitering amongst tulips and roses.\r\n  His witchery makes Life develop itself\r\n  And become self-questioning and impatient.\r\n  He invites the whole world to his table;\r\n  He lavishes his fire as though it were cheap as air.             720\r\n  Woe to a people that resigns itself to death,\r\n  And whose poet turns away from the joy of living!\r\n  His mirror shows beauty as ugliness,\r\n  His honey leaves a hundred stings in the heart.\r\n  His kiss robs the rose of freshness,                             725\r\n  He takes away from the nightingale’s heart the joy of flying.\r\n  Thy sinews are relaxed by his opium,\r\n  Thou payest for his song with thy life.\r\n  He bereaves the cypress of delight in its beauty,\r\n  His cold breath makes a pheasant of the male falcon.             730\r\n  He is a fish, and from the breast upward a man,\r\n  Like the Sirens in the ocean.\r\n  With his song he enchants the pilot\r\n  And casts the ship to the bottom of the sea.\r\n  His melodies steal firmness from thine heart,                    735\r\n  His magic persuades thee that death is life.\r\n  He takes from thy soul the desire of existence,\r\n  He extracts from thy mine the blushing ruby.\r\n  He dresses gain in the garb of loss,\r\n  He makes everything praiseworthy blameful.                       740\r\n  He plunges thee in a sea of thought,\r\n  He makes thee a stranger to action.\r\n  He is sick, and by his words our sickness is increased:\r\n  The more his cup goes round, the more sick are they that\r\n      quaff it.\r\n  There are no lightning-rains in his April,                       745\r\n  His garden is a mirage of colour and perfume.\r\n  His beauty hath no dealings with Truth,\r\n  There are none but flawed pearls in his sea.\r\n  Slumber he deemed sweeter than waking:\r\n  Our fire was quenched by his breath.                             750\r\n  By the chant of his nightingale the heart was poisoned:\r\n  Under his heap of roses lurked a snake.\r\n  Beware of his decanter and cup!\r\n  Beware of his sparkling wine!\r\n  O thou whom his wine hath laid low                               755\r\n  And who look’st to his glass for thy rising dawn,\r\n  O thou whose heart hath been chilled by his melodies,\r\n  Thou hast drunk deadly poison through the ear!\r\n  Thy way of life

miserable base-born underling\r\n  Without worth or hope or object,\r\n  Whose lamentations have sucked the marrow from thy soul\r\n  And driven off gentle sleep from thy neighbours’ eyes.\r\n  Alas for a love whose fire is extinct,                           785\r\n  A love that was born in the Holy Place and died in the\r\n      house of idols!\r\n  Oh, if thou hast the coin of poesy in thy

legend, discovered the Fountain of Life in\r\nthe Land of Darkness.\r\n\r\n[60] In this passage the author assails the Persian and Urdu poetry so\r\nmuch in favour with his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[61] Arabic odes usually begin with a prelude in which the poet makes\r\nmention of his beloved; and her name is often Salmá. Here “the Salmá of\r\nAraby” refers to the Koran and the ideals for which it stands.\r\n\r\n[62] It is related that an ignorant Kurd came to some students and\r\nbesought them to instruct him in the mysteries of Súfism. They told him\r\nthat he must fasten a rope to the roof of his house, then tie the loose\r\nend to his feet and suspend himself, head downwards; and that he must\r\nremain in this posture as long as possible, reciting continually some\r\nwords of gibberish which they taught him. The poor man did not perceive\r\nthat he was being mocked. He followed their instructions and passed\r\nthe whole night repeating the words given him. God rewarded his faith\r\nand sincerity by granting him illumination, so that he became a saint\r\nand could discourse learnedly on the most abstruse matters of mystical\r\ntheology. Afterwards he used to say, “In the evening I was a Kurd, but\r\nthe next morning I was an Arab.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n_Showing that the education of the Self has three stages: Obedience,\r\nSelf-control, and Divine Vicegerency._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OBEDIENCE\r\n\r\n  Service and toil are traits of the camel,                        815\r\n  Patience and perseverance are ways of the camel.\r\n  Noiselessly he steps along the sandy track,\r\n  He is the ship of those who voyage in the desert.\r\n  Every thicket knows the print of his foot:\r\n  He eats seldom, sleeps little, and is inured to toil.            820\r\n  He carries rider, baggage, and litter;\r\n  He trots on and on to the journey’s end,\r\n  Rejoicing in his speed,\r\n  More patient in travel than his rider.\r\n  Thou, too, do not refuse the burden of Duty:                     825\r\n  So wilt thou enjoy the best dwelling-place, which is with\r\n      God.\r\n  Endeavour to obey, O heedless one!\r\n  Liberty is the fruit of compulsion.\r\n  By obedience the man of no worth is made worthy;\r\n  By disobedience his fire is turned to ashes.                     830\r\n  Whoso would master the sun and stars,\r\n  Let him make himself a prisoner of Law!\r\n  The wind is enthralled by the fragrant rose;\r\n  The perfume is confined in the navel of the musk-deer.\r\n  The star moves towards its goal                                  835\r\n  With head bowed in surrender to a law.\r\n  The grass springs up in obedience to the law of growth:\r\n  When it abandons that, it is trodden underfoot.\r\n  To burn unceasingly is the law of the tulip,\r\n  And so the blood leaps in its veins.                             840\r\n  Drops of water become a sea by the law of union,\r\n  And grains of sand become a Sahara.\r\n  Since Law makes everything strong within,\r\n  Why dost thou neglect this source of strength?\r\n  O thou that art emancipated from the old Custom,[63]             845\r\n  Adorn thy feet once more with the same fine silver chain!\r\n  Do not complain of the hardness of the Law,\r\n  Do not transgress the statutes of Mohammed!\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SELF-CONTROL\r\n\r\n  Thy soul cares only for itself, like the camel:\r\n  It is self-conceited, self-governed, and self-willed.            850\r\n  Be a man, get its halter into thine hand,\r\n  That thou mayst become a pearl albeit thou art a potter’s\r\n      vessel.\r\n  He that does not command himself\r\n  Becomes a receiver of commands from others.\r\n  When they moulded thee of clay,                                  855\r\n  Love and fear were mingled in thy making:\r\n  Fear of this world and of the world to come, fear of death,\r\n  Fear of all the pains of earth and heaven;\r\n  Love of riches and power, love of country,\r\n  Love of self and kindred and wife.                               860\r\n  The mixing of clay with water nourishes the body,[64]\r\n  But he that is drowned in sin dies an evil death.\r\n  So long as thou hold’st the staff of “There is no God but\r\n      He,”[65]\r\n  Thou wilt break every spell of fear.\r\n  One to whom God is as the soul in his body,                      865\r\n  His neck is not bowed before vanity.\r\n  Fear finds no way into his bosom,\r\n  His heart is afraid of none but Allah.\r\n  Whoso dwells in the Moslem Faith\r\n  Is free from the bonds of wife and child.                        870\r\n  He withdraws his gaze from all except God\r\n  And lays the knife to the throat of his son.[66]\r\n  Though single, he is like a host in onset:\r\n  Life is cheaper in his eyes than wind.\r\n  The profession of Faith is the shell, but prayer is the\r\n      pearl:                                                       875\r\n  The Moslem’s heart deems prayer a lesser pilgrimage.[67]\r\n  In the Moslem’s hand prayer is like a dagger\r\n  Killing sin and frowardness and wrong.\r\n  Fasting makes an assault upon hunger and thirst\r\n  And breaches the citadel of sensuality.                          880\r\n  The pilgrimage enlightens the minds of the Faithful:\r\n  It teaches separation from one’s home and destroys\r\n      attachment to one’s native land;\r\n  It is an act of devotion in which all feel themselves to be\r\n      one,\r\n  It binds together the leaves of the book of religion.\r\n  Almsgiving causes love of riches to pass away                    885\r\n  And makes equality familiar;\r\n  It fortifies the heart with righteousness,[68]\r\n  It increases wealth and diminishes fondness for wealth.\r\n  All this is a means of strengthening thee:\r\n  Thou art impregnable, if thy Islam be strong.                    890\r\n  Draw might from the litany “O Almighty One!”\r\n  That thou mayst ride the camel of thy body.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. DIVINE VICEGERENCY[70]\r\n\r\n  If thou canst rule thy camel, thou wilt rule the world\r\n  And wear on thine head the crown of Solomon.\r\n  Thou wilt be the glory of the world whilst the world lasts,      895\r\n  And thou wilt reign in the kingdom incorruptible.\r\n  ‘Tis sweet to be God’s vicegerent in the world\r\n  And exercise sway over the elements.\r\n  God’s vicegerent is as the soul of the universe,\r\n  His being is the shadow of the Greatest Name.                    900\r\n  He knows the mysteries of part and whole,\r\n  He executes the command of Allah in the world.\r\n  When he pitches his tent in the wide world,\r\n  He rolls up this ancient carpet.[71]\r\n  His genius abounds with life and desires to manifest itself:     905\r\n  He will bring another world into existence.\r\n  A hundred worlds like this world of parts and wholes\r\n  Spring up, like roses, from the seed of his imagination.\r\n  He makes every raw nature ripe,\r\n  He puts the idols out of the sanctuary.                          910\r\n  Heart-strings give forth music at his touch,\r\n  He wakes and sleeps for God alone.\r\n  He teaches age the melody of youth\r\n  And endows everything with the radiance of youth.\r\n  To the human race he brings both a glad message and a\r\n      warning,                                                     915\r\n  He comes both as a soldier and as a marshal and prince.\r\n  He is the final cause of “God taught Adam the names of all\r\n      things,”[72]\r\n  He is the inmost sense of “Glory to Him that transported His\r\n      servant by night.”[73]\r\n  His white hand is strengthened by the staff,[74]\r\n  His knowledge is twinned with the power of a perfect man.        920\r\n  When that bold cavalier seizes the reins,\r\n  The steed of Time gallops faster.\r\n  His awful mien makes the Red Sea dry,\r\n  He leads Israel out of Egypt.\r\n  At his cry, “Arise,” the dead spirits                            925\r\n  Rise in their bodily tomb, like pines in the field.\r\n  His person is an atonement for all the world,\r\n  By his grandeur the world is saved.[75]\r\n  His protecting shadow makes the mote familiar with the sun,\r\n  His rich substance makes precious all that exists.               930\r\n  He bestows life by miraculous works,\r\n  He founds a new system to work by.\r\n  Splendid visions rise from the print of his foot,\r\n  Many a Moses is entranced by his Sinai.\r\n  He gives a new explanation of Life,                              935\r\n  A new interpretation of this dream.\r\n  His hidden being is Life’s mystery,\r\n  The unheard music of Life’s harp.\r\n  Nature travails in blood for generations\r\n  To compose the harmony of his personality.                       940\r\n  When our handful of earth has reached the zenith,\r\n  That champion will come forth from this dust!\r\n  There sleeps amidst the ashes of To-day\r\n  The flame of a world-consuming morrow.\r\n  Our bud enfolds a garden of roses,                               945\r\n  Our eyes are bright with to-morrow’s dawn.\r\n  Appear, O rider of Destiny!\r\n  Appear, O light of the dark realm of Change!\r\n  Illumine the scene of existence,\r\n  Dwell in the blackness of our eyes!                              950\r\n  Silence the noise of the nations,\r\n  Imparadise our ears with thy music!\r\n  Arise and tune the harp of brotherhood,\r\n  Give us back the cup of the wine of love!\r\n  Bring once more days of peace to the world,                      955\r\n  Give a message of peace to them that seek battle!\r\n  Mankind are the cornfield and thou the harvest,\r\n  Thou art the goal of Life’s caravan.\r\n  The leaves are scattered by Autumn’s fury:\r\n  Oh, do thou pass over our gardens as the Spring!                 960\r\n  Receive from our downcast brows\r\n  The homage of little children and of young men and old!\r\n  When thou art there, we will lift up our heads,\r\n  Content to suffer the burning fire of this world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] The religious law of Islam.\r\n\r\n[64] _I.e._ water is an indispensable element in the life of the body.\r\n\r\n[65] The first article of the Mohammedan creed.\r\n\r\n[66] Like Abraham when he was about to sacrifice Isaac or (as Moslems\r\ngenerally believe) Ishmael.\r\n\r\n[67] The lesser pilgrimage (_’umra_) is not obligatory like the greater\r\npilgrimage (_hajj_).\r\n\r\n[68] The original quotes part of a verse in the Koran (ch. 3, v. 86),\r\nwhere it is said, “Ye shall never attain unto righteousness until ye\r\ngive in alms of that which ye love.”\r\n\r\n[69] _I.e._ overcome the lusts of the flesh.\r\n\r\n[70] Here Iqbal interprets in his own way the Súfí doctrine of the\r\n_Insán al-kámil_ or Perfect Man, which teaches that every man is\r\npotentially a microcosm, and that when he has become spiritually\r\nperfect, all the Divine attributes are displayed by him, so that as\r\nsaint or prophet he is the God-man, the representative and vicegerent\r\nof God on earth.\r\n\r\n[71] _I.e._ his appearance marks the end of an epoch.\r\n\r\n[72] Koran, ch. 2, v. 29.

Tulips, rather, that warn one not to smell them--\r\n  Like paper roses, a mirage of perfume.\r\n  Since this garden ceased to enthral me,                         1475\r\n  I have nested on the Paradisal tree.\r\n  Modern knowledge is the greatest blind--\r\n  Idol-worshipping, idol-selling, idol-making!\r\n  Shackled in the prison of phenomena,\r\n  It has not overleaped the limits of the sensible.               1480\r\n  It has fallen down in crossing the bridge of Life,\r\n  It has laid the knife to its own throat.\r\n  Having fire, it is yet cold as the tulip;\r\n  Having flame, it is yet cold as hail.\r\n  Its nature remains untouched by the glow of Love,               1485\r\n  It is ever engaged in a joyless search.\r\n  Love is the Plato that heals the sicknesses of the mind:[101]\r\n  The mind’s melancholy is cured by its lancet.\r\n  The whole world bows in adoration to Love,\r\n  Love is the Mahmúd that conquers the Somnath of\r\n      intellect.[102]                                             1490\r\n  Modern science lacks this old wine in its cup,\r\n  Its nights are not loud with passionate prayer.\r\n  Thou hast misprized thine own cypress\r\n  And deemed tall the cypress of others.\r\n  Like the reed, thou hast emptied thyself of Self                1495\r\n  And given thine heart to the music of others.\r\n  O thou that begg’st morsels from another’s table,\r\n  Wilt thou seek thine own kind in another’s shop?\r\n  The Moslem’s feast is burned up by the lamps of strangers,\r\n  His mosque is consumed by the Christian monastery.              1500\r\n  When the deer fled from the sacred territory of Mecca,\r\n  The hunter’s arrow pierced her side.[103]\r\n  The leaves of the rose are scattered, like its scent:\r\n  O thou that hast fled from thy Self, come back to it!\r\n  O trustee of the wisdom of the Koran,                           1505\r\n  Find thy lost unity again!\r\n  We, who keep the gate of the citadel of Islam,\r\n  Have become unbelievers by neglecting the watchword of Islam.\r\n  The ancient Saki’s bowl is shattered,\r\n  The wine-party of the Hijáz is broken up.                       1510\r\n  The Ka`ba is filled with our idols,\r\n  Infidelity mocks at our Islam.\r\n  Our Sheikh hath gambled Islam away for love of idols\r\n  And made a rosary of the _zunnár_.[104]\r\n  Our spiritual directors owe their rank to their white hairs     1515\r\n  And are the laughing-stock of children in the street;\r\n  Their hearts bear no impress of the Faith\r\n  But house the idols of sensuality.\r\n  Every long-haired fellow wears the garb of a dervish--\r\n  Alas for these traffickers in religion!                         1520\r\n  Day and night they are travelling about with disciples,\r\n  And ignoring their religious duties.\r\n  Their eyes are without light, like the narcissus,\r\n  Their breasts devoid of spiritual wealth.\r\n  Preachers and Súfís, all worship worldliness alike;             1525\r\n  The prestige of the pure religion is ruined.\r\n  Our preacher fixed his eyes on the pagoda\r\n  And the mufti of the Faith sold his decision.\r\n  After this, O friends, what are we to do?\r\n  Our guide turns his face towards the wine-house.                1530\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] This appears to be a pseudonym assumed by the author.\r\n\r\n[97] Jalálu’ddín Rúmí.\r\n\r\n[98] Bábá Kamáluddín Jundí.

CLARK, LIMITED, _Edinburgh_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nObsolete, archaic, inconsistent and unusual spellings have been\r\nmaintained from the original text. The only changes to the text were:\r\n\r\n- In footnote 38, “Jalálu’ddín Rúmí” was originally “Jalálu’ddin Rúmí.”\r\n\r\n- The line number on line 995 was missing.\r\n\r\n- On line 1300, “Pleiades” was originally “Pleiads.”\r\n\r\n- On line 1428, “Jalálu’ddín Rúmí” was originally “Jaláluddín Rúmí.”\r\n\r\n- In footnote 97, “Jalálu’ddín Rúmí” was originally “Jaláluddín Rúmí.”\r\n\r\n- In footnote 98, “Jalálu’ddín Rúmí” was originally “Jaláluddín Rúmí.”\r\n\r\nI also changed internal cross-references from notes and pages to line\r\nnumber (or section of the Introduction) and footnote number.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76 gives the meaning of the name Murtazá as “he whom with\r\nGod is pleased.” This translation is awkward, so awkward that it\r\nappears to me likely that it is wrong, _i.e._ “with whom” rather\r\nthan “whom with.” However I checked other sources, and the meaning\r\nas stated is correct, although “he who is pleased with God,” or “he\r\nwho is content with God,” or “he for whom God is sufficient” might be\r\neasier to read.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90 includes a word in Greek. When the original book has text\r\nin another alphabet, I include both the text in the other alphabet\r\nand a transliteration, because some reading platforms are not able to\r\ndisplay the other alphabet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98 refers to another book by the translator: _Selected Poems\r\nfrom the Diváni Shamsi Tabríz_. This is the title as published,\r\nalthough elsewhere in this work the author is referred to as Shams-i\r\nTabríz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Secrets of the Self, by Muhammad Iqbal",
