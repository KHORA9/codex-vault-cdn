S. Macran, Hegel's Doctrine of Formal Logic, Oxford, 1912. Hegel's argument in this portion of his �Logic� depends throughout upon confusing the �is� of predication, as in �Socrates is mortal,� with the �is� of identity, as in �Socrates is the philosopher who drank the hemlock.� Owing to this confusion, he thinks that �Socrates� and �mortal� must be identical. Seeing that they are different, he does not infer, as others would, that there is a mistake somewhere, but that they exhibit �identity in difference.� Again, Socrates is particular, �mortal� is universal. Therefore, he says, since Socrates is mortal, it follows that the particular is the universal�taking the �is� to be throughout expressive of identity. But to say �the particular is the universal� is self-contradictory. Again Hegel does not suspect a mistake but proceeds to synthesise particular and universal in the individual, or concrete universal. This is an example of how, for want of care at the start, vast and imposing systems of philosophy are built upon stupid and trivial confusions, which, but for the almost incredible fact that they are unintentional, one would be tempted to characterise as puns.\r\n[13] Cf. Couturat, La Logique de Leibniz, pp. 361, 386.\r\n[14] It was often recognised that there was some difference between them, but it was not recognised that the difference is fundamental, and of very great importance.\r\n[15] Encyclop�dia of the Philosophical Sciences, vol. i. p. 97.\r\n[16] This perhaps requires modification in order to include such facts as beliefs and wishes, since such facts apparently contain propositions as components. Such facts, though not strictly atomic, must be supposed included if the statement in the text is to be true.\r\n[17] The assumptions made concerning time-relations in the above are as follows:�\r\n[18] The above paradox is essentially the same as Zeno's argument of the stadium which will be considered in our next lecture.\r\n[19] See next lecture.\r\n[20] Monist, July 1912, pp. 337�341.\r\n[21] �Le continu math�matique,� Revue de M�taphysique et de Morale, vol. i. p. 29.\r\n[22] In what concerns the early Greek philosophers, my knowledge is largely derived from Burnet's valuable work, Early Greek Philosophy (2nd ed., London, 1908). I have also been greatly assisted by Mr D. S. Robertson of Trinity College, who has supplied the deficiencies of my knowledge of Greek, and brought important references to my notice.\r\n[23] Cf. Aristotle, Metaphysics, M. 6, 1080b, 18 sqq., and 1083b, 8 sqq.\r\n[24] There is some reason to think that the Pythagoreans distinguished between discrete and continuous quantity. G. J. Allman, in his Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid, says (p. 23): �The Pythagoreans made a fourfold division of mathematical science, attributing one of its parts to the how many, t? p?s??, and the other to the how much, t? p??????; and they assigned to each of these parts a twofold division. For they said that discrete quantity, or the how many, either subsists by itself or must be considered with relation to some other; but that continued quantity, or the how much, is either stable or in motion. Hence they affirmed that arithmetic contemplates that discrete quantity which subsists by itself, but music that which is related to another; and that geometry considers continued quantity so far as it is immovable; but astronomy (t?? sfa??????) contemplates continued quantity so far as it is of a self-motive nature. (Proclus, ed. Friedlein, p. 35. As to the distinction between t? p??????, continuous, and t? p?s??, discrete quantity, see Iambl., in Nicomachi Geraseni Arithmeticam introductionem, ed. Tennulius, p. 148.)� Cf. p. 48.\r\n[25] Referred to by Burnet, op. cit., p. 120.\r\n[26] iv., 6. 213b, 22; H. Ritter and L. Preller, Historia Philosophi� Gr�c�, 8th ed., Gotha, 1898, p. 75 (this work will be referred to in future as �R. P.�).\r\n[27] The Pythagorean proof is roughly as follows. If possible, let the ratio of the diagonal to the side of a square be m/n, where m and n are whole numbers having no common factor. Then we must have m2 = 2n2. Now the square of an odd number is odd, but m2, being equal to 2n2, is even. Hence m must be even. But the square of an even number divides by 4, therefore n2, which is half of m2, must be even. Therefore n must be even. But, since m is even, and m and n have no common factor, n must be odd. Thus n must be both odd and even, which is impossible; and therefore the diagonal and the side cannot have a rational ratio.\r\n[28] In regard to Zeno and the Pythagoreans, I have derived much valuable information and criticism from Mr P.

For there are two senses in which the term �infinite� is applied both to length and to time, and in fact to all continuous things, either in regard to divisibility, or in regard to the ends. Now it is not possible to touch things infinite in regard to number in a finite time, but it is possible to touch things infinite in regard to divisibility: for time itself also is infinite in this sense. So that in fact we go through an infinite, [space] in an infinite [time] and not in a finite [time], and we touch infinite things with infinite things, not with finite things.� Philoponus, a sixth-century commentator (R.P. 136A, Exc.

Vit.), gives the following illustration: �For if a thing were moved the space of a cubit in one hour, since in every space there are an infinite number of points, the thing moved must needs touch all the points of the space: it will then go through an infinite collection in a finite time, which is impossible.�\r\n[42] Cf.

W. Russell\r\nFellow Of Trinity College, Cambridge\r\n1897\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\tINTRODUCTION.\r\n\tOUR PROBLEM DEFINED BY ITS RELATIONS TO LOGIC, PSYCHOLOGY AND MATHEMATICS.\r\n\t\tPAGE\r\n1. \tThe problem first received a modern form through Kant, who connected the � priori with the subjective \t1\r\n2. \tA mental state is subjective, for Psychology, when its immediate cause does not lie in the outer world \t2\r\n3. \tA piece of knowledge is � priori, for Epistemology, when without it knowledge would be impossible \t2\r\n4. \tThe subjective and the � priori belong respectively to Psychology and to Epistemology. The latter alone will be investigated in this essay \t3\r\n5. \tMy test of the � priori will be purely logical: what knowledge is necessary for experience? \t3\r\n6. \tBut since the necessary is hypothetical, we must include, in the � priori, the ground of necessity \t4\r\n7. \tThis may be the essential postulate of our science, or the element, in the subject-matter, which is necessary to experience; \t4\r\n8. \tWhich, however, are both at bottom the same ground \t5\r\n9. \tForecast of the work \t5\r\n\r\n\tCHAPTER I.\r\n\tA SHORT HISTORY OF METAGEOMETRY.\r\n10. \tMetageometry began by rejecting the axiom of parallels \t7\r\n11. \tIts history may be divided into three periods: the synthetic, the metrical and the projective \t7\r\n12. \tThe first period was inaugurated by Gauss, \t10\r\n[viii] 13. \tWhose suggestions were developed independently by Lobatchewsky \t10\r\n14. \tAnd Bolyai \t11\r\n15. \tThe purpose of all three was to show that the axiom of parallels could not be deduced from the others, since its denial did not lead to contradictions \t12\r\n16. \tThe second period had a more philosophical aim, and was inspired chiefly by Gauss and Herbart \t13\r\n17. \tThe first work of this period, that of Riemann, invented two new conceptions: \t14\r\n18. \tThe first, that of a manifold, is a class-conception, containing space as a species, \t14\r\n19. \tAnd defined as such that its determinations form a collection of magnitudes \t15\r\n20. \tThe second, the measure of curvature of a manifold, grew out of curvature in curves and surfaces \t16\r\n21. \tBy means of Gauss's analytical formula for the curvature of surfaces, \t19\r\n22. \tWhich enables us to define a constant measure of curvature of a three-dimensional space without reference to a fourth dimension \t20\r\n23. \tThe main result of Riemann's mathematical work was to show that, if magnitudes are independent of place, the measure of curvature of space must be constant \t21\r\n24. \tHelmholtz, who was more of a philosopher than a mathematician, \t22\r\n25. \tGave a new but incorrect formulation of the essential axioms, \t23\r\n26. \tAnd deduced the quadratic formula for the infinitesimal arc, which Riemann had assumed \t24\r\n27. \tBeltrami gave Lobatchewsky's planimetry a Euclidean interpretation, \t25\r\n28. \tWhich is analogous to Cayley's theory of distance; \t26\r\n29. \tAnd dealt with n-dimensional spaces of constant negative curvature \t27\r\n30. \tThe third period abandons the metrical methods of the second, and extrudes the notion of spatial quantity \t27\r\n31. \tCayley reduced metrical properties to projective properties, relative to a certain conic or quadric, the Absolute; \t28\r\n32. \tAnd Klein showed that the Euclidean or non-Euclidean systems result, according to the nature of the Absolute; \t29\r\n33. \tHence Euclidean space appeared to give rise to all the kinds of Geometry, and the question, which is true, appeared reduced to one of convention \t30\r\n34. \tBut this view is due to a confusion as to the nature of the coordinates employed \t30\r\n[ix] 35. \tProjective coordinates have been regarded as dependent on distance, and thus really metrical \t31\r\n36. \tBut this is not the case, since anharmonic ratio can be projectively defined \t32\r\n37. \tProjective coordinates, being purely descriptive, can give no information as to metrical properties, and the reduction of metrical to projective properties is purely technical \t33\r\n38. \tThe true connection of Cayley's measure of distance with non-Euclidean Geometry is that suggested by Beltrami's Saggio, and worked out by Sir R. Ball, \t36\r\n39. \tWhich provides a Euclidean equivalent for every non-Euclidean proposition, and so removes the possibility of contradictions in Metageometry \t38\r\n40. \tKlein's elliptic Geometry has not been proved to have a corresponding variety of space \t39\r\n41. \tThe geometrical use of imaginaries, of which Cayley demanded a philosophical discussion, \t41\r\n42. \tHas a merely technical validity, \t42\r\n43. \tAnd is capable of giving geometrical results only when it begins and ends with real points and figures \t45\r\n44. \tWe have now seen that projective Geometry is logically prior to metrical Geometry, but cannot supersede it \t46\r\n45. \tSophus Lie has applied projective methods to Helmholtz's formulation of the axioms, and has shown the axiom of Monodromy to be superfluous \t46\r\n46. \tMetageometry has gradually grown independent of philosophy, but has grown continually more interesting to philosophy \t50\r\n47. \tMetrical Geometry has three indispensable axioms, \t50\r\n48. \tWhich we shall find to be not results, but conditions, of measurement, \t51\r\n49. \tAnd which are nearly equivalent to the three axioms of projective Geometry \t52\r\n50. \tBoth sets of axioms are necessitated, not by facts, but by logic \t52\r\n\r\n\tCHAPTER II.\r\n\tCRITICAL ACCOUNT OF SOME PREVIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL THEORIES OF GEOMETRY.\r\n51. \tA criticism of representative modern theories need not begin before Kant \t54\r\n52. \tKant's doctrine must be taken, in an argument about Geometry, on its purely logical side \t55\r\n[x] 53. \tKant contends that since Geometry is apodeictic, space must be � priori and subjective, while since space is � priori and subjective, Geometry must be apodeictic \t55\r\n54. \tMetageometry has upset the first line of argument, not the second \t56\r\n55. \tThe second may be attacked by criticizing either the distinction of synthetic and analytic judgments, or the first two arguments of the metaphysical deduction of space \t57\r\n56. \tModern Logic regards every judgment as both synthetic and analytic, \t57\r\n57. \tBut leaves the � priori, as that which is presupposed in the possibility of experience \t59\r\n58. \tKant's first two arguments as to space suffice to prove some form of externality, but not necessarily Euclidean space, a necessary condition of experience \t60\r\n59. \tAmong the successors of Kant, Herbart alone advanced the theory of Geometry, by influencing Riemann \t62\r\n60. \tRiemann regarded space as a particular kind of manifold, i.e. wholly quantitatively \t63\r\n61. \tHe therefore unduly neglected the qualitative adjectives of space \t64\r\n62. \tHis philosophy rests on a vicious disjunction \t65\r\n63. \tHis definition of a manifold is obscure, \t66\r\n64. \tAnd his definition of measurement applies only to space \t67\r\n65. \tThough mathematically invaluable, his view of space as a manifold is philosophically misleading \t69\r\n66. \tHelmholtz attacked Kant both on the mathematical and on the psychological side; \t70\r\n67. \tBut his criterion of apriority is changeable and often invalid; \t71\r\n68. \tHis proof that non-Euclidean spaces are imaginable is inconclusive; \t72\r\n69. \tAnd his assertion of the dependence of measurement on rigid bodies, which may be taken in three senses, \t74\r\n70. \tIs wholly false if it means that the axiom of Congruence actually asserts the existence of rigid bodies, \t75\r\n71. \tIs untrue if it means that the necessary reference of geometrical propositions to matter renders pure Geometry empirical, \t76\r\n72. \tAnd is inadequate to his conclusion if it means, what is true, that actual measurement involves approximately rigid bodies \t78\r\n73. \tGeometry deals with an abstract matter, whose physical properties are disregarded; and Physics must presuppose Geometry \t80\r\n74. \tErdmann accepted the conclusions of Riemann and Helmholtz, \t81\r\n[xi] 75. \tAnd regarded the axioms as necessarily successive steps in classifying space as a species of manifold \t82\r\n76. \tHis deduction involves four fallacious assumptions, namely: \t82\r\n77. \tThat conceptions must be abstracted from a series of instances; \t83\r\n78. \tThat all definition is classification; \t83\r\n79. \tThat conceptions of magnitude can be applied to space as a whole; \t84\r\n80. \tAnd that if conceptions of magnitude could be so applied, all the adjectives of space would result from their application \t86\r\n81. \tErdmann regards Geometry alone as incapable of deciding on the truth of the axiom of Congruence, \t86\r\n82. \tWhich he affirms to be empirically proved by Mechanics. \t88\r\n83. \tThe variety and inadequacy of Erdmann's tests of apriority \t89\r\n84. \tInvalidate his final conclusions on the theory of Geometry \t90\r\n85. \tLotze has discussed two questions in the theory of Geometry: \t93\r\n86. \t(1) He regards the possibility of non-Euclidean spaces as suggested by the subjectivity of space, \t93\r\n87. \tAnd rejects it owing to a mathematical misunderstanding, \t96\r\n88. \tHaving missed the most important sense of their possibility, \t96\r\n89. \tWhich is that they fulfil the logical conditions to which any form of externality must conform \t97\r\n90. \t(2) He attacks the mathematical procedure of Metageometry \t98\r\n91. \tThe attack begins with a question-begging definition of parallels \t99\r\n92. \tLotze maintains that all apparent departures from Euclid could be physically explained, a view which really makes Euclid empirical \t99\r\n93. \tHis criticism of Helmholtz's analogies rests wholly on mathematical mistakes \t101\r\n94. \tHis proof that space must have three dimensions rests on neglect of different orders of infinity \t104\r\n95. \tHe attacks non-Euclidean spaces on the mistaken ground that they are not homogeneous \t107\r\n96. \tLotze's objections fall under four heads \t108\r\n97. \tTwo other semi-philosophical objections may be urged, \t109\r\n98. \tOne of which, the absence of similarity, has been made the basis of attack by Delbouf, \t110\r\n99. \tBut does not form a valid ground of objection \t111\r\n100. \tRecent French speculation on the foundations of Geometry has suggested few new views \t112\r\n101. \tAll homogeneous spaces are � priori possible, and the decision between them is empirical \t114\r\n [xii]\r\n\tCHAPTER III.\r\n\tSection A. the axioms of projective geometry.\r\n102. \tProjective Geometry does not deal with magnitude, and applies to all spaces alike \t117\r\n103. \tIt will be found wholly � priori \t117\r\n104. \tIts axioms have not yet been formulated philosophically \t118\r\n105. \tCoordinates, in projective Geometry, are not spatial magnitudes, but convenient names for points \t118\r\n106. \tThe possibility of distinguishing various points is an axiom \t119\r\n107. \tThe qualitative relations between points, dealt with by projective Geometry, are presupposed by the quantitative treatment \t119\r\n108. \tThe only qualitative relation between two points is the straight line, and all straight lines are qualitatively similar \t120\r\n109. \tHence follows, by extension, the principle of projective transformation \t121\r\n110. \tBy which figures qualitatively indistinguishable from a given figure are obtained \t122\r\n111. \tAnharmonic ratio may and must be descriptively defined \t122\r\n112. \tThe quadrilateral construction is essential to the projective definition of points, \t123\r\n113. \tAnd can be projectively defined, \t124\r\n114. \tBy the general principle of projective transformation \t126\r\n115. \tThe principle of duality is the mathematical form of a philosophical circle, \t127\r\n116. \tWhich is an inevitable consequence of the relativity of space, and makes any definition of the point contradictory \t128\r\n117. \tWe define the point as that which is spatial, but contains no space, whence other definitions follow \t128\r\n118. \tWhat is meant by qualitative equivalence in Geometry? \t129\r\n119. \tTwo pairs of points on one straight line, or two pairs of straight lines through one point, are qualitatively equivalent \t129\r\n120. \tThis explains why four collinear points are needed, to give an intrinsic relation by which the fourth can be descriptively defined when the first three are given \t130\r\n121. \tAny two projectively related figures are qualitatively equivalent, i.e. differ in no non-quantitative conceptual property \t131\r\n122. \tThree axioms are used by projective Geometry, \t132\r\n[xiii] 123. \tAnd are required for qualitative spatial comparison, \t132\r\n124. \tWhich involves the homogeneity, relativity and passivity of space \t133\r\n125. \tThe conception of a form of externality, \t134\r\n126. \tBeing a creature of the intellect, can be dealt with by pure mathematics \t134\r\n127. \tThe resulting doctrine of extension will be, for the moment, hypothetical \t135\r\n128. \tBut is rendered assertorical by the necessity, for experience, of some form of externality \t136\r\n129. \tAny such form must be relational \t136\r\n130. \tAnd homogeneous \t137\r\n131. \tAnd the relations constituting it must appear infinitely divisible \t137\r\n132. \tIt must have a finite integral number of dimensions, \t139\r\n133. \tOwing to its passivity and homogeneity \t140\r\n134. \tAnd to the systematic unity of the world \t140\r\n135. \tA one-dimensional form alone would not suffice for experience \t141\r\n136. \tSince its elements would be immovably fixed in a series \t142\r\n137. \tTwo positions have a relation independent of other positions, \t143\r\n138. \tSince positions are wholly defined by mutually independent relations \t143\r\n139. \tHence projective Geometry is wholly � priori, \t146\r\n140. \tThough metrical Geometry contains an empirical element \t146\r\n\tSection B. the axioms of metrical geometry.\r\n141. \tMetrical Geometry is distinct from projective, but has the same fundamental postulate \t147\r\n142. \tIt introduces the new idea of motion, and has three � priori axioms \t148\r\n\tI. The Axiom of Free Mobility.\r\n143. \tMeasurement requires a criterion of spatial equality \t149\r\n144. \tWhich is given by superposition, and involves the axiom of Free Mobility \t150\r\n145. \tThe denial of this axiom involves an action of empty space on things \t151\r\n146. \tThere is a mathematically possible alternative to the axiom, \t152\r\n147. \tWhich, however, is logically and philosophically untenable \t153\r\n148. \tThough Free Mobility is � priori, actual measurement is empirical \t154\r\n[xiv] 149. \tSome objections remain to be answered, concerning� \t154\r\n150. \t(1) The comparison of volumes and of Kant's symmetrical objects \t154\r\n151. \t(2) The measurement of time, where congruence is impossible \t156\r\n152. \t(3) The immediate perception of spatial magnitude; and \t157\r\n153. \t(4) The Geometry of non-congruent surfaces \t158\r\n154. \tFree Mobility includes Helmholtz's Monodromy \t159\r\n155. \tFree Mobility involves the relativity of space \t159\r\n156. \tFrom which, reciprocally, it can be deduced \t160\r\n157. \tOur axiom is therefore � priori in a double sense \t160\r\n\tII. The Axiom of Dimensions.\r\n158. \tSpace must have a finite integral number of dimensions \t161\r\n159. \tBut the restriction to three is empirical \t162\r\n160. \tThe general axiom follows from the relativity of position \t162\r\n161. \tThe limitation to three dimensions, unlike most empirical knowledge, is accurate and certain \t163\r\n\tIII. The Axiom of Distance.\r\n162. \tThe axiom of distance corresponds, here, to that of the straight line in projective Geometry \t164\r\n163. \tThe possibility of spatial measurement involves a magnitude uniquely determined by two points, \t164\r\n164. \tSince two points must have some relation, and the passivity of space proves this to be independent of external reference \t165\r\n165. \tThere can be only one such relation \t166\r\n166. \tThis must be measured by a curve joining the two points, \t166\r\n167. \tAnd the curve must be uniquely determined by the two points \t167\r\n168. \tSpherical Geometry contains an exception to this axiom, \t168\r\n169. \tWhich, however, is not quite equivalent to Euclid's \t168\r\n170. \tThe exception is due to the fact that two points, in spherical space, may have an external relation unaltered by motion, \t169\r\n171. \tWhich, however, being a relation of linear magnitude, presupposes the possibility of linear magnitude \t170\r\n172. \tA relation between two points must be a line joining them \t170\r\n173. \tConversely, the existence of a unique line between two points can be deduced from the nature of a form of externality, \t171\r\n174. \tAnd necessarily leads to distance, when quantity is applied to it \t172\r\n[xv] 175. \tHence the axiom of distance, also, is � priori in a double sense \t172\r\n176. \tNo metrical coordinate system can be set up without the straight line \t174\r\n177. \tNo axioms besides the above three are necessary to metrical Geometry \t175\r\n178. \tBut these three are necessary to the direct measurement of any continuum \t176\r\n179. \tTwo philosophical questions remain for a final chapter \t177\r\n\r\n\tCHAPTER IV.\r\n\tPHILOSOPHICAL CONSEQUENCES.\r\n180. \tWhat is the relation to experience of a form of externality in general? \t178\r\n181. \tThis form is the class-conception, containing every possible intuition of externality; and some such intuition is necessary to experience \t178\r\n182. \tWhat relation does this view bear to Kant's? \t179\r\n183. \tIt is less psychological, since it does not discuss whether space is given in sensation, \t180\r\n184. \tAnd maintains that not only space, but any form of externality which renders experience possible, must be given in sense-perception \t181\r\n185. \tExternality should mean, not externality to the Self, but the mutual externality of presented things \t181\r\n186. \tWould this be unknowable without a given form of externality? \t182\r\n187. \tBradley has proved that space and time preclude the existence of mere particulars, \t182\r\n188. \tAnd that knowledge requires the This to be neither simple nor self-subsistent \t183\r\n189. \tTo prove that experience requires a form of externality, I assume that all knowledge requires the recognition of identity in difference \t184\r\n190. \tSuch recognition involves time \t184\r\n191. \tAnd some other form giving simultaneous diversity \t185\r\n192. \tThe above argument has not deduced sense-perception from the categories, but has shown the former, unless it contains a certain element, to be unintelligible to the latter \t186\r\n193. \tHow to account for the realization of this element, is a question for metaphysics \t187\r\n[xvi] 194. \tWhat are we to do with the contradictions in space? \t188\r\n195. \tThree contradictions will be discussed in what follows \t188\r\n196. \t(1) The antinomy of the Point proves the relativity of space, \t189\r\n197. \tAnd shows that Geometry must have some reference to matter, \t190\r\n198. \tBy which means it is made to refer to spatial order, not to empty space \t191\r\n199. \tThe causal properties of matter are irrelevant to Geometry, which must regard it as composed of unextended atoms, by which points are replaced \t191\r\n200. \t(2) The circle in defining straight lines and planes is overcome by the same reference to matter \t192\r\n201. \t(3) The antinomy that space is relational and yet more than relational, \t193\r\n202. \tSeems to depend on the confusion of empty space with spatial order \t193\r\n203. \tKant regarded empty space as the subject-matter of Geometry, \t194\r\n204. \tBut the arguments of the Aesthetic are inconclusive on this point, \t195\r\n205. \tAnd are upset by the mathematical antinomies, which prove that spatial order should be the subject-matter of Geometry \t196\r\n206. \tThe apparent thinghood of space is a psychological illusion, due to the fact that spatial relations are immediately given \t196\r\n207. \tThe apparent divisibility of spatial relations is either an illusion, arising out of empty space, or the expression of the possibility of quantitatively different spatial relations \t197\r\n208. \tExternality is not a relation, but an aspect of relations. Spatial order, owing to its reference to matter, is a real relation \t198\r\n209. \tConclusion \t199\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY MEN FIGHT\r\nA METHOD OF ABOLISHING THE INTERNATIONAL DUEL\r\nBy Bertrand Russell\r\nCONTENTS\r\nCHAPTER \tPAGE\r\nI \tThe Principle of Growth \t3\r\nII \tThe State \t42\r\nIII \tWar as an Institution \t79\r\nIV \tProperty \t117\r\nV \tEducation \t153\r\nVI \tMarriage and the Population Question \t182\r\nVII \tReligion and the Churches \t215\r\nVIII \tWhat We Can Do \t245",
