For instance, the nature of fire is to burn; it burns without\r\nwill or intelligence. The nature of water is fluidity; it flows without\r\nwill or intelligence. The nature of the sun is radiance; it shines without\r\nwill or intelligence. The nature of vapor is to ascend; it ascends without\r\nwill or intelligence. Thus it is clear that the natural movements of all\r\nthings are compelled; there are no voluntary movements except those of\r\nanimals and, above all, those of man. Man is able to resist and to oppose\r\nNature because he discovers the constitution of things, and through this\r\nhe commands the forces of Nature; all the inventions he has made are due\r\nto his discovery of the constitution of things. For example, he invented\r\nthe telegraph, which is the means of communication between the East and\r\nthe West. It is evident, then, that man rules over Nature.\r\n\r\nNow, when you behold in existence such organizations, arrangements and\r\nlaws, can you say that all these are the effect of Nature, though Nature\r\nhas neither intelligence nor perception? If not, it becomes evident that\r\nthis Nature, which has neither perception nor intelligence, is in the\r\ngrasp of Almighty God, Who is the Ruler of the world of Nature; whatever\r\nHe wishes, He causes Nature to manifest.\r\n\r\nOne of the things which has appeared in the world of existence, and which\r\nis one of the requirements of Nature, is human life. Considered from this\r\npoint of view man is the branch; nature is the root. Then can the will and\r\nthe intelligence, and the perfections which exist in the branch, be absent\r\nin the root?\r\n\r\nIt is said that Nature in its own essence is in the grasp of the power of\r\nGod, Who is the Eternal Almighty One: He holds Nature within accurate\r\nregulations and laws, and rules over it.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: PROOFS AND EVIDENCES OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the proofs and demonstrations of the existence of God is the fact\r\nthat man did not create himself: nay, his creator and designer is another\r\nthan himself.\r\n\r\nIt is certain and indisputable that the creator of man is not like man\r\nbecause a powerless creature cannot create another being. The maker, the\r\ncreator, has to possess all perfections in order that he may create.\r\n\r\nCan the creation be perfect and the creator imperfect? Can a picture be a\r\nmasterpiece and the painter imperfect in his art? For it is his art and\r\nhis creation. Moreover, the picture cannot be like the painter; otherwise,\r\nthe painting would have created itself. However perfect the picture may\r\nbe, in comparison with the painter it is in the utmost degree of\r\nimperfection.\r\n\r\nThe contingent world is the source of imperfections: God is the origin of\r\nperfections. The imperfections of the contingent world are in themselves a\r\nproof of the perfections of God.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you look at man, you see that he is weak. This very\r\nweakness of the creature is a proof of the power of the Eternal Almighty\r\nOne, because, if there were no power, weakness could not be imagined. Then\r\nthe weakness of the creature is a proof of the power of God; for if there\r\nwere no power, there could be no weakness; so from this weakness it\r\nbecomes evident that there is power in the world. Again, in the contingent\r\nworld there is poverty; then necessarily wealth exists, since poverty is\r\napparent in the world. In the contingent world there is ignorance;\r\nnecessarily knowledge exists, because ignorance is found; for if there\r\nwere no knowledge, neither would there be ignorance. Ignorance is the\r\nnonexistence of knowledge, and if there were no existence, nonexistence\r\ncould not be realized.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the whole contingent world is subjected to a law and\r\nrule which it can never disobey; even man is forced to submit to death, to\r\nsleep and to other conditions--that is to say, man in certain particulars\r\nis governed, and necessarily this state of being governed implies the\r\nexistence of a governor. Because a characteristic of contingent beings is\r\ndependency, and this dependency is an essential necessity, therefore,\r\nthere must be an independent being whose independence is essential.\r\n\r\nIn the same way it is understood from the man who is sick that there must\r\nbe one who is in health; for if there were no health, his sickness could\r\nnot be proved.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it becomes evident that there is an Eternal Almighty One, Who\r\nis the possessor of all perfections, because unless He possessed all\r\nperfections He would be like His creation.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world of existence it is the same; the smallest created\r\nthing proves that there is a creator. For instance, this piece of bread\r\nproves that it has a maker.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God! the least change produced in the form of the smallest\r\nthing proves the existence of a creator: then can this great universe,\r\nwhich is endless, be self-created and come into existence from the action\r\nof matter and the elements? How self-evidently wrong is such a\r\nsupposition!\r\n\r\nThese obvious arguments are adduced for weak souls; but if the inner\r\nperception be open, a hundred thousand clear proofs become visible. Thus,\r\nwhen man feels the indwelling spirit, he is in no need of arguments for\r\nits existence; but for those who are deprived of the bounty of the spirit,\r\nit is necessary to establish external arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: THE NEED OF AN EDUCATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we consider existence, we see that the mineral, vegetable, animal and\r\nhuman worlds are all in need of an educator.\r\n\r\nIf the earth is not cultivated, it becomes a jungle where useless weeds\r\ngrow; but if a cultivator comes and tills the ground, it produces crops\r\nwhich nourish living creatures. It is evident, therefore, that the soil\r\nneeds the cultivation of the farmer. Consider the trees: if they remain\r\nwithout a cultivator, they will be fruitless, and without fruit they are\r\nuseless; but if they receive the care of a gardener, these same barren\r\ntrees become fruitful, and through cultivation, fertilization and\r\nengrafting the trees which had bitter fruits yield sweet fruits. These are\r\nrational proofs; in this age the peoples of the world need the arguments\r\nof reason.\r\n\r\nThe same is true with respect to animals: notice that when the animal is\r\ntrained it becomes domestic, and also that man, if he is left without\r\neducation, becomes bestial, and, moreover, if left under the rule of\r\nnature, becomes lower than an animal, whereas if he is educated he becomes\r\nan angel. For the greater number of animals do not devour their own kind,\r\nbut men, in the Sudan, in the central regions of Africa, kill and eat each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nNow reflect that it is education that brings the East and the West under\r\nthe authority of man; it is education that produces wonderful industries;\r\nit is education that spreads great sciences and arts; it is education that\r\nmakes manifest new discoveries and institutions. If there were no\r\neducator, there would be no such things as comforts, civilization or\r\nhumanity. If a man be left alone in a wilderness where he sees none of his\r\nown kind, he will undoubtedly become a mere brute; it is then clear that\r\nan educator is needed.\r\n\r\nBut education is of three kinds: material, human and spiritual. Material\r\neducation is concerned with the progress and development of the body,\r\nthrough gaining its sustenance, its material comfort and ease. This\r\neducation is common to animals and man.\r\n\r\nHuman education signifies civilization and progress--that is to say,\r\ngovernment, administration, charitable works, trades, arts and\r\nhandicrafts, sciences, great inventions and discoveries and elaborate\r\ninstitutions, which are the activities essential to man as distinguished\r\nfrom the animal.\r\n\r\nDivine education is that of the Kingdom of God: it consists in acquiring\r\ndivine perfections, and this is true education; for in this state man\r\nbecomes the focus of divine blessings, the manifestation of the words,\r\n\"Let Us make man in Our image, and after Our likeness.\"(2) This is the\r\ngoal of the world of humanity.\r\n\r\nNow we need an educator who will be at the same time a material, human and\r\nspiritual educator, and whose authority will be effective in all\r\nconditions. So if anyone should say, \"I possess perfect comprehension and\r\nintelligence, and I have no need of such an educator,\" he would be denying\r\nthat which is clear and evident, as though a child should say, \"I have no\r\nneed of education; I will act according to my reason and intelligence, and\r\nso I shall attain the perfections of existence\"; or as though the blind\r\nshould say, \"I am in no need of sight, because many other blind people\r\nexist without difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nThen it is plain and evident that man needs an educator, and this educator\r\nmust be unquestionably and indubitably perfect in all respects and\r\ndistinguished above all men. Otherwise, if he should be like the rest of\r\nhumanity, he could not be their educator, more particularly because he\r\nmust be at the same time their material and human as well as their\r\nspiritual educator--that is to say, he must teach men to organize and carry\r\nout physical matters, and to form a social order in order to establish\r\ncooperation and mutual aid in living so that material affairs may be\r\norganized and regulated for any circumstances that may occur. In the same\r\nway he must establish human education--that is to say, he must educate\r\nintelligence and thought in such a way that they may attain complete\r\ndevelopment, so that knowledge and science may increase, and the reality\r\nof things, the mysteries of beings and the properties of existence may be\r\ndiscovered; that, day by day, instructions, inventions and institutions\r\nmay be improved; and from things perceptible to the senses conclusions as\r\nto intellectual things may be deduced.\r\n\r\nHe must also impart spiritual education, so that intelligence and\r\ncomprehension may penetrate the metaphysical world, and may receive\r\nbenefit from the sanctifying breeze of the Holy Spirit, and may enter into\r\nrelationship with the Supreme Concourse. He must so educate the human\r\nreality that it may become the center of the divine appearance, to such a\r\ndegree that the attributes and the names of God shall be resplendent in\r\nthe mirror of the reality of man, and the holy verse \"We will make man in\r\nOur image and likeness\" shall be realized.(3)\r\n\r\nIt is clear that human power is not able to fill such a great office, and\r\nthat reason alone could not undertake the responsibility of so great a\r\nmission. How can one solitary person without help and without support lay\r\nthe foundations of such a noble construction? He must depend on the help\r\nof the spiritual and divine power to be able to undertake this mission.\r\nOne Holy Soul gives life to the world of humanity, changes the aspect of\r\nthe terrestrial globe, causes intelligence to progress, vivifies souls,\r\nlays the basis of a new life, establishes new foundations, organizes the\r\nworld, brings nations and religions under the shadow of one standard,\r\ndelivers man from the world of imperfections and vices, and inspires him\r\nwith the desire and need of natural and acquired perfections. Certainly\r\nnothing short of a divine power could accomplish so great a work. We ought\r\nto consider this with justice, for this is the office of justice.\r\n\r\nA Cause which all the governments and peoples of the world, with all their\r\npowers and armies, cannot promulgate and spread, one Holy Soul can promote\r\nwithout help or support! Can this be done by human power? No, in the name\r\nof God! For example, Christ, alone and solitary, upraised the standard of\r\npeace and righteousness, a work which all the victorious governments with\r\nall their hosts are unable to accomplish. Consider what was the fate of so\r\nmany and diverse empires and peoples: the Roman Empire, France, Germany,\r\nRussia, England, etc.; all were gathered together under the same tent--that\r\nis to say, the appearance of Christ brought about a union among these\r\ndiverse nations, some of whom, under the influence of Christianity, became\r\nso united that they sacrificed their lives and property for one another.\r\nAfter the time of Constantine, who was the protagonist of Christianity,\r\ndivisions broke out among them. The point is this, that Christ united\r\nthese nations but after a while governments became the cause of discord.\r\nWhat I mean is that Christ sustained a Cause that all the kings of the\r\nearth could not establish! He united the various religions and modified\r\nancient customs. Consider what great differences existed between Romans,\r\nGreeks, Syrians, Egyptians, Phoenicians, Israelites and other peoples of\r\nEurope. Christ removed these differences and became the cause of love\r\nbetween these communities. Although after some time governments destroyed\r\nthis union, the work of Christ was accomplished.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Universal Educator must be at the same time a physical,\r\nhuman and spiritual educator; and He must possess a supernatural power, so\r\nthat He may hold the position of a divine teacher. If He does not show\r\nforth such a holy power, He will not be able to educate, for if He be\r\nimperfect, how can He give a perfect education? If He be ignorant, how can\r\nHe make others wise? If He be unjust, how can He make others just? If He\r\nbe earthly, how can He make others heavenly?\r\n\r\nNow we must consider justly: did these Divine Manifestations Who have\r\nappeared possess all these qualifications or not?(4) If They had not these\r\nqualifications and these perfections, They were not real Educators.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it must be our task to prove to the thoughtful by reasonable\r\narguments the prophethood of Moses, of Christ and of the other Divine\r\nManifestations. And the proofs and evidences which we give are not based\r\non traditional but on rational arguments.\r\n\r\nIt has now been proved by rational arguments that the world of existence\r\nis in the utmost need of an educator, and that its education must be\r\nachieved by divine power. There is no doubt that this holy power is\r\nrevelation, and that the world must be educated through this power which\r\nis above human power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: ABRAHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of those Who possessed this power and was assisted by it was Abraham.\r\nAnd the proof of it was that He was born in Mesopotamia, and of a family\r\nwho were ignorant of the Oneness of God. He opposed His own nation and\r\npeople, and even His own family, by rejecting all their gods. Alone and\r\nwithout help He resisted a powerful tribe, a task which is neither simple\r\nnor easy. It is as if in this day someone were to go to a Christian people\r\nwho are attached to the Bible, and deny Christ; or in the Papal Court--God\r\nforbid!--if such a one were in the most powerful manner to blaspheme\r\nagainst Christ and oppose the people.\r\n\r\nThese people believed not in one God but in many gods, to whom they\r\nascribed miracles; therefore, they all arose against Him, and no one\r\nsupported Him except Lot, His brother's son, and one or two other people\r\nof no importance. At last, reduced to the utmost distress by the\r\nopposition of His enemies, He was obliged to leave His native land. In\r\nreality they banished Him in order that He might be crushed and destroyed,\r\nand that no trace of Him might be left.\r\n\r\nAbraham then came into the region of the Holy Land. His enemies considered\r\nthat His exile would lead to His destruction and ruin, as it seemed\r\nimpossible that a man banished from His native land, deprived of His\r\nrights and oppressed on all sides--even though He were a king--could escape\r\nextermination. But Abraham stood fast and showed forth extraordinary\r\nfirmness--and God made this exile to be to His eternal honor--until He\r\nestablished the Unity of God in the midst of a polytheistic generation.\r\nThis exile became the cause of the progress of the descendants of Abraham,\r\nand the Holy Land was given to them. As a result the teachings of Abraham\r\nwere spread abroad, a Jacob appeared among His posterity, and a Joseph who\r\nbecame ruler in Egypt. In consequence of His exile a Moses and a being\r\nlike Christ were manifested from His posterity, and Hagar was found from\r\nwhom Ishmael was born, one of whose descendants was Muhammad. In\r\nconsequence of His exile the Bab appeared from His posterity,(5) and the\r\nProphets of Israel were numbered among the descendants of Abraham. And so\r\nit will continue for ever and ever. Finally, in consequence of His exile\r\nthe whole of Europe and most of Asia came under the protecting shadow of\r\nthe God of Israel. See what a power it is that enabled a Man Who was a\r\nfugitive from His country to found such a family, to establish such a\r\nfaith, and to promulgate such teachings. Can anyone say that all this\r\noccurred accidentally? We must be just: was this Man an Educator or not?\r\n\r\nSince the exile of Abraham from Ur to Aleppo in Syria produced this\r\nresult, we must consider what will be the effect of the exile of\r\nBaha'u'llah in His several removes from Tihran to Ba_gh_dad, from thence\r\nto Constantinople, to Rumelia and to the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nSee what a perfect Educator Abraham was!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: MOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nMoses was for a long time a shepherd in the wilderness. Regarded\r\noutwardly, He was a Man brought up in a tyrannical household, and was\r\nknown among men as One Who had committed a murder and become a shepherd.\r\nBy the government and the people of Pharaoh He was much hated and\r\ndetested.\r\n\r\nIt was such a Man as this that freed a great nation from the chains of\r\ncaptivity, made them contented, brought them out from Egypt, and led them\r\nto the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nThis people from the depths of degradation were lifted up to the height of\r\nglory. They were captive; they became free. They were the most ignorant of\r\npeoples; they became the most wise. As the result of the institutions that\r\nMoses gave them, they attained a position which entitled them to honor\r\namong all nations, and their fame spread to all lands, to such a degree\r\nindeed that among surrounding nations if one wished to praise a man one\r\nsaid, \"Surely he is an Israelite.\" Moses established laws and ordinances;\r\nthese gave life to the people of Israel, and led them to the highest\r\npossible degree of civilization at that period.\r\n\r\nTo such a development did they attain that the philosophers of Greece\r\nwould come and acquire knowledge from the learned men of Israel. Such an\r\none was Socrates, who visited Syria, and took from the children of Israel\r\nthe teachings of the Unity of God and of the immortality of the soul.\r\nAfter his return to Greece, he promulgated these teachings. Later the\r\npeople of Greece rose in opposition to him, accused him of impiety,\r\narraigned him before the Areopagus, and condemned him to death by poison.\r\n\r\nNow, how could a Man Who was a stammerer, Who had been brought up in the\r\nhouse of Pharaoh, Who was known among men as a murderer, Who through fear\r\nhad for a long time remained in concealment, and Who had become a\r\nshepherd, establish so great a Cause, when the wisest philosophers on\r\nearth have not displayed one thousandth part of this influence? This is\r\nindeed a prodigy.\r\n\r\nA Man Who had a stammering tongue, Who could not even converse correctly,\r\nsucceeded in sustaining this great Cause! If He had not been assisted by\r\ndivine power, He would never have been able to carry out this great work.\r\nThese facts are undeniable. Materialist philosophers, Greek thinkers, the\r\ngreat men of Rome became famous in the world, each one of them having\r\nspecialized in one branch of learning only. Thus Galen and Hippocrates\r\nbecame celebrated in medicine, Aristotle in logic and reasoning, and Plato\r\nin ethics and theology. How is it that a shepherd could acquire all of\r\nthis knowledge? It is beyond doubt that He must have been assisted by an\r\nomnipotent power.\r\n\r\nConsider also what trials and difficulties arise for people. To prevent an\r\nact of cruelty, Moses struck down an Egyptian and afterward became known\r\namong men as a murderer, more notably because the man He had killed was of\r\nthe ruling nation. Then He fled, and it was after that that He was raised\r\nto the rank of a Prophet!\r\n\r\nIn spite of His evil repute, how wonderfully He was guided by a\r\nsupernatural power in establishing His great institutions and laws!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: CHRIST\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterward Christ came, saying, \"I am born of the Holy Spirit.\" Though it\r\nis now easy for the Christians to believe this assertion, at that time it\r\nwas very difficult. According to the text of the Gospel the Pharisees\r\nsaid, \"Is not this the son of Joseph of Nazareth Whom we know? How can He\r\nsay, therefore, I came down from heaven?\"(6)\r\n\r\nBriefly, this Man, Who, apparently, and in the eyes of all, was lowly,\r\narose with such great power that He abolished a religion that had lasted\r\nfifteen hundred years, at a time when the slightest deviation from it\r\nexposed the offender to danger or to death. Moreover, in the days of\r\nChrist the morals of the whole world and the condition of the Israelites\r\nhad become completely confused and corrupted, and Israel had fallen into a\r\nstate of the utmost degradation, misery and bondage. At one time they had\r\nbeen taken captive by the Chaldeans and Persians; at another time they\r\nwere reduced to slavery to the Assyrians; then they became the subjects\r\nand vassals of the Greeks; and finally they were ruled over and despised\r\nby the Romans.\r\n\r\nThis young Man, Christ, by the help of a supernatural power, abrogated the\r\nancient Mosaic Law, reformed the general morals, and once again laid the\r\nfoundation of eternal glory for the Israelites. Moreover, He brought to\r\nhumanity the glad tidings of universal peace, and spread abroad teachings\r\nwhich were not for Israel alone but were for the general happiness of the\r\nwhole human race.\r\n\r\nThose who first strove to do away with Him were the Israelites, His own\r\nkindred. To all outward appearances they overcame Him and brought Him into\r\ndirest distress. At last they crowned Him with the crown of thorns and\r\ncrucified Him. But Christ, while apparently in the deepest misery and\r\naffliction, proclaimed, \"This Sun will be resplendent, this Light will\r\nshine, My grace will surround the world, and all My enemies will be\r\nbrought low.\" And as He said, so it was; for all the kings of the earth\r\nhave not been able to withstand Him. Nay, all their standards have been\r\noverthrown, while the banner of that Oppressed One has been raised to the\r\nzenith.\r\n\r\nBut this is opposed to all the rules of human reason. Then it becomes\r\nclear and evident that this Glorious Being was a true Educator of the\r\nworld of humanity, and that He was helped and confirmed by divine power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: MUHAMMAD\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we come to Muhammad. Americans and Europeans have heard a number of\r\nstories about the Prophet which they have thought to be true, although the\r\nnarrators were either ignorant or antagonistic: most of them were clergy;\r\nothers were ignorant Muslims who repeated unfounded traditions about\r\nMuhammad which they ignorantly believed to be to His praise.\r\n\r\nThus some benighted Muslims made His polygamy the pivot of their praises\r\nand held it to be a wonder, regarding it as a miracle; and European\r\nhistorians, for the most part, rely on the tales of these ignorant people.\r\n\r\nFor example, a foolish man said to a clergyman that the true proof of\r\ngreatness is bravery and the shedding of blood, and that in one day on the\r\nfield of battle a follower of Muhammad had cut off the heads of one\r\nhundred men! This misled the clergyman to infer that killing is considered\r\nthe way to prove one's faith to Muhammad, while this is merely imaginary.\r\nThe military expeditions of Muhammad, on the contrary, were always\r\ndefensive actions: a proof of this is that during thirteen years, in\r\nMecca, He and His followers endured the most violent persecutions. At this\r\nperiod they were the target for the arrows of hatred: some of His\r\ncompanions were killed and their property confiscated; others fled to\r\nforeign lands. Muhammad Himself, after the most extreme persecutions by\r\nthe Quray_sh_ites, who finally resolved to kill Him, fled to Medina in the\r\nmiddle of the night. Yet even then His enemies did not cease their\r\npersecutions, but pursued Him to Medina, and His disciples even to\r\nAbyssinia.\r\n\r\nThese Arab tribes were in the lowest depths of savagery and barbarism, and\r\nin comparison with them the savages of Africa and wild Indians of America\r\nwere as advanced as a Plato. The savages of America do not bury their\r\nchildren alive as these Arabs did their daughters, glorying in it as being\r\nan honorable thing to do.(7) Thus many of the men would threaten their\r\nwives, saying, \"If a daughter is born to you, I will kill you.\" Even down\r\nto the present time the Arabs dread having daughters. Further, a man was\r\npermitted to take a thousand women, and most husbands had more than ten\r\nwives in their household. When these tribes made war, the one which was\r\nvictorious would take the women and children of the vanquished tribe\r\ncaptive and treat them as slaves.\r\n\r\nWhen a man who had ten wives died, the sons of these women rushed at each\r\nother's mothers; and if one of the sons threw his mantle over the head of\r\nhis father's wife and cried out, \"This woman is my lawful property,\" at\r\nonce the unfortunate woman became his prisoner and slave. He could do\r\nwhatever he wished with her. He could kill her, imprison her in a well, or\r\nbeat, curse and torture her until death released her. According to the\r\nArab habits and customs, he was her master. It is evident that malignity,\r\njealousy, hatred and enmity must have existed between the wives and\r\nchildren of a household, and it is, therefore, needless to enlarge upon\r\nthe subject. Again, consider what was the condition and life of these\r\noppressed women! Moreover, the means by which these Arab tribes lived\r\nconsisted in pillage and robbery, so that they were perpetually engaged in\r\nfighting and war, killing one another, plundering and devastating each\r\nother's property, and capturing women and children, whom they would sell\r\nto strangers. How often it happened that the daughters and sons of a\r\nprince, who spent their day in comfort and luxury, found themselves, when\r\nnight fell, reduced to shame, poverty and captivity. Yesterday they were\r\nprinces, today they are captives; yesterday they were great ladies, today\r\nthey are slaves.\r\n\r\nMuhammad received the Divine Revelation among these tribes, and after\r\nenduring thirteen years of persecution from them, He fled.(8) But this\r\npeople did not cease to oppress; they united to exterminate Him and all\r\nHis followers. It was under such circumstances that Muhammad was forced to\r\ntake up arms. This is the truth: we are not bigoted and do not wish to\r\ndefend Him, but we are just, and we say what is just. Look at it with\r\njustice. If Christ Himself had been placed in such circumstances among\r\nsuch tyrannical and barbarous tribes, and if for thirteen years He with\r\nHis disciples had endured all these trials with patience, culminating in\r\nflight from His native land--if in spite of this these lawless tribes\r\ncontinued to pursue Him, to slaughter the men, to pillage their property,\r\nand to capture their women and children--what would have been Christ's\r\nconduct with regard to them? If this oppression had fallen only upon\r\nHimself, He would have forgiven them, and such an act of forgiveness would\r\nhave been most praiseworthy; but if He had seen that these cruel and\r\nbloodthirsty murderers wished to kill, to pillage and to injure all these\r\noppressed ones, and to take captive the women and children, it is certain\r\nthat He would have protected them and would have resisted the tyrants.\r\nWhat objection, then, can be taken to Muhammad's action? Is it this, that\r\nHe did not, with His followers, and their women and children, submit to\r\nthese savage tribes? To free these tribes from their bloodthirstiness was\r\nthe greatest kindness, and to coerce and restrain them was a true mercy.\r\nThey were like a man holding in his hand a cup of poison, which, when\r\nabout to drink, a friend breaks and thus saves him. If Christ had been\r\nplaced in similar circumstances, it is certain that with a conquering\r\npower He would have delivered the men, women and children from the claws\r\nof these bloodthirsty wolves.\r\n\r\nMuhammad never fought against the Christians; on the contrary, He treated\r\nthem kindly and gave them perfect freedom. A community of Christian people\r\nlived at Najran and were under His care and protection. Muhammad said, \"If\r\nanyone infringes their rights, I Myself will be his enemy, and in the\r\npresence of God I will bring a charge against him.\" In the edicts which He\r\npromulgated it is clearly stated that the lives, properties and honor of\r\nthe Christians and Jews are under the protection of God; and that if a\r\nMuhammadan married a Christian woman, the husband must not prevent her\r\nfrom going to church, nor oblige her to veil herself; and that if she\r\ndied, he must place her remains in the care of the Christian clergy.\r\nShould the Christians desire to build a church, Islam ought to help them.\r\nIn case of war between Islam and her enemies, the Christians should be\r\nexempted from the obligation of fighting, unless they desired of their own\r\nfree will to do so in defense of Islam, because they were under its\r\nprotection. But as a compensation for this immunity, they should pay\r\nyearly a small sum of money. In short, there are seven detailed edicts on\r\nthese subjects, some copies of which are still extant at Jerusalem. This\r\nis an established fact and is not dependent on my affirmation. The edict\r\nof the second Caliph(9) still exists in the custody of the orthodox\r\nPatriarch of Jerusalem, and of this there is no doubt.(10)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after a certain time, and through the transgression of both\r\nthe Muhammadans and the Christians, hatred and enmity arose between them.\r\nBeyond this fact, all the narrations of the Muslims, Christians and others\r\nare simply fabrications, which have their origin in fanaticism, or\r\nignorance, or emanate from intense hostility.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Muslims say that Muhammad cleft the moon, and that it\r\nfell on the mountain of Mecca: they think that the moon is a small body\r\nwhich Muhammad divided into two parts and threw one part on this mountain,\r\nand the other part on another mountain.\r\n\r\nSuch stories are pure fanaticism. Also the traditions which the clergy\r\nquote, and the incidents with which they find fault, are all exaggerated,\r\nif not entirely without foundation.\r\n\r\nBriefly, Muhammad appeared in the desert of Hijaz in the Arabian\r\nPeninsula, which was a desolate, sterile wilderness, sandy and\r\nuninhabited. Some parts, like Mecca and Medina, are extremely hot; the\r\npeople are nomads with the manners and customs of the dwellers in the\r\ndesert, and are entirely destitute of education and science. Muhammad\r\nHimself was illiterate, and the Qur'an was originally written upon the\r\nbladebones of sheep, or on palm leaves. These details indicate the\r\ncondition of the people to whom Muhammad was sent. The first question\r\nwhich He put to them was, \"Why do you not accept the Pentateuch and the\r\nGospel, and why do you not believe in Christ and in Moses?\" This saying\r\npresented difficulties to them, and they argued, \"Our forefathers did not\r\nbelieve in the Pentateuch and the Gospel; tell us, why was this?\" He\r\nanswered, \"They were misled; you ought to reject those who do not believe\r\nin the Pentateuch and the Gospel, even though they are your fathers and\r\nyour ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a country, and amidst such barbarous tribes, an illiterate Man\r\nproduced a book in which, in a perfect and eloquent style, He explained\r\nthe divine attributes and perfections, the prophethood of the Messengers\r\nof God, the divine laws, and some scientific facts.\r\n\r\nThus, you know that before the observations of modern times--that is to\r\nsay, during the first centuries and down to the fifteenth century of the\r\nChristian era--all the mathematicians of the world agreed that the earth\r\nwas the center of the universe, and that the sun moved. The famous\r\nastronomer who was the protagonist of the new theory discovered the\r\nmovement of the earth and the immobility of the sun.(11) Until his time\r\nall the astronomers and philosophers of the world followed the Ptolemaic\r\nsystem, and whoever said anything against it was considered ignorant.\r\nThough Pythagoras, and Plato during the latter part of his life, adopted\r\nthe theory that the annual movement of the sun around the zodiac does not\r\nproceed from the sun, but rather from the movement of the earth around the\r\nsun, this theory had been entirely forgotten, and the Ptolemaic system was\r\naccepted by all mathematicians. But there are some verses revealed in the\r\nQur'an contrary to the theory of the Ptolemaic system. One of them is \"The\r\nsun moves in a fixed place,\" which shows the fixity of the sun, and its\r\nmovement around an axis.(12) Again, in another verse, \"And each star moves\r\nin its own heaven.\"(13) Thus is explained the movement of the sun, of the\r\nmoon, of the earth, and of other bodies. When the Qur'an appeared, all the\r\nmathematicians ridiculed these statements and attributed the theory to\r\nignorance. Even the doctors of Islam, when they saw that these verses were\r\ncontrary to the accepted Ptolemaic system, were obliged to explain them\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the fifteenth century of the Christian era, nearly\r\nnine hundred years after Muhammad, that a famous astronomer made new\r\nobservations and important discoveries by the aid of the telescope, which\r\nhe had invented.(14) The rotation of the earth, the fixity of the sun, and\r\nalso its movement around an axis, were discovered. It became evident that\r\nthe verses of the Qur'an agreed with existing facts, and that the\r\nPtolemaic system was imaginary.\r\n\r\nIn short, many Oriental peoples have been reared for thirteen centuries\r\nunder the shadow of the religion of Muhammad. During the Middle Ages,\r\nwhile Europe was in the lowest depths of barbarism, the Arab peoples were\r\nsuperior to the other nations of the earth in learning, in the arts,\r\nmathematics, civilization, government and other sciences. The Enlightener\r\nand Educator of these Arab tribes, and the Founder of the civilization and\r\nperfections of humanity among these different races, was an illiterate\r\nMan, Muhammad. Was this illustrious Man a thorough Educator or not? A just\r\njudgment is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: THE BAB\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the Bab--may my soul be His sacrifice!--at a youthful age, that is to\r\nsay, when He had reached the twenty-fifth year of His blessed life, He\r\nstood forth to proclaim His Cause.(15) It was universally admitted by the\r\n_Sh_i'is that He had never studied in any school and had not acquired\r\nknowledge from any teacher; all the people of _Sh_iraz bear witness to\r\nthis. Nevertheless, He suddenly appeared before the people, endowed with\r\nthe most complete erudition. Although He was but a merchant, He confounded\r\nall the 'ulama of Persia.(16) All alone, in a way which is beyond\r\nimagination, He upheld the Cause among the Persians, who are renowned for\r\ntheir religious fanaticism. This illustrious Soul arose with such power\r\nthat He shook the supports of the religion, of the morals, the conditions,\r\nthe habits and the customs of Persia, and instituted new rules, new laws\r\nand a new religion. Though the great personages of the State, nearly all\r\nthe clergy, and the public men arose to destroy and annihilate Him, He\r\nalone withstood them and moved the whole of Persia.\r\n\r\nMany 'ulama and public men, as well as other people, joyfully sacrificed\r\ntheir lives in His Cause, and hastened to the plain of martyrdom.\r\n\r\nThe government, the nation, the doctors of divinity and the great\r\npersonages desired to extinguish His light, but they could not do so. At\r\nlast His moon arose, His star shone forth, His foundations became firmly\r\nestablished, and His dawning-place became brilliant. He imparted divine\r\neducation to an unenlightened multitude and produced marvelous results on\r\nthe thoughts, morals, customs and conditions of the Persians. He announced\r\nthe glad tidings of the manifestation of the Sun of Baha to His followers\r\nand prepared them to believe.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of such wonderful signs and great results; the effects\r\nproduced upon the minds of the people, and upon the prevailing ideas; the\r\nestablishment of the foundations of progress; and the organization of the\r\nprinciples of success and prosperity by a young merchant, constitute the\r\ngreatest proof that He was a perfect Educator. A just person will never\r\nhesitate to believe this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: BAHA'U'LLAH\r\n\r\n\r\nBaha'u'llah(17) appeared at a time when the Persian Empire was immersed in\r\nprofound obscurantism and ignorance and lost in the blindest fanaticism.\r\n\r\nIn the European histories, no doubt, you have read detailed accounts of\r\nthe morals, customs and ideas of the Persians during the last centuries.\r\nIt is useless to repeat them. Briefly, we will say that Persia had fallen\r\nso low that to all foreign travelers it was a matter of regret that this\r\ncountry, which in former times had been so glorious and highly civilized,\r\nhad now become so decayed, ruined and upset, and that its population had\r\nlost its dignity.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Baha'u'llah appeared. His father was one of the\r\nviziers, not one of the 'ulama. As all the people of Persia know, He had\r\nnever studied in any school, nor had He associated with the 'ulama or the\r\nmen of learning. The early part of His life was passed in the greatest\r\nhappiness. His companions and associates were Persians of the highest\r\nrank, but not learned men.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Bab became manifested, Baha'u'llah said, \"This great Man is\r\nthe Lord of the righteous, and faith in Him is incumbent upon all.\" And He\r\narose to assist the Bab and gave many proofs and positive evidences of His\r\ntruth, in spite of the fact that the 'ulama of the state religion had\r\nconstrained the Persian government to oppose and resist Him and had\r\nfurther issued decrees ordering the massacre, pillage, persecution and\r\nexpulsion of His followers. In all the provinces they began to kill, to\r\nburn, to pillage the converts and even to assault the women and children.\r\nRegardless of this, Baha'u'llah arose to proclaim the word of the Bab with\r\nthe greatest firmness and energy. Not for one moment was He in\r\nconcealment; He mixed openly with His enemies. He was occupied in showing\r\nforth evidences and proofs and was recognized as the Herald of the Word of\r\nGod. In many changes and chances He endured the greatest misfortunes, and\r\nat every moment He ran the risk of being martyred.\r\n\r\nHe was put into chains and confined in an underground prison. His vast\r\nproperty and inheritance were pillaged and confiscated. He was exiled four\r\ntimes from land to land and found rest only in the \"Greatest Prison.\"(18)\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this He never ceased for one instant His proclamation of\r\nthe greatness of the Cause of God. He manifested such virtue, knowledge\r\nand perfections that He became a wonder to all the people of Persia. So\r\nmuch so that in Tihran, Ba_gh_dad, Constantinople, Rumelia, and even in\r\nAkka, every one of the learned and scientific men who entered His\r\npresence, whether friend or enemy, never failed to receive the most\r\nsufficient and convincing answer to whatever question was propounded. All\r\nfrequently acknowledged that He was alone and unique in all perfections.\r\n\r\nIt often happened that in Ba_gh_dad certain Muhammadan 'ulama, Jewish\r\nrabbis and Christians met together with some European scholars, in a\r\nblessed reunion: each one had some question to propose, and although they\r\nwere possessed of varying degrees of culture, they each heard a sufficient\r\nand convincing reply, and retired satisfied. Even the Persian 'ulama who\r\nwere at Karbila and Najaf chose a wise man whom they sent on a mission to\r\nHim; his name was Mulla Hasan 'Amu. He came into the Holy Presence, and\r\nproposed a number of questions on behalf of the 'ulama, to which\r\nBaha'u'llah replied. Then Hasan 'Amu said, \"The 'ulama recognize without\r\nhesitation and confess the knowledge and virtue of Baha'u'llah, and they\r\nare unanimously convinced that in all learning he has no peer or equal;\r\nand it is also evident that he has never studied or acquired this\r\nlearning; but still the 'ulama say, 'We are not contented with this; we do\r\nnot acknowledge the reality of his mission by virtue of his wisdom and\r\nrighteousness. Therefore, we ask him to show us a miracle in order to\r\nsatisfy and tranquilize our hearts.'\"\r\n\r\nBaha'u'llah replied, \"Although you have no right to ask this, for God\r\nshould test His creatures, and they should not test God, still I allow and\r\naccept this request. But the Cause of God is not a theatrical display that\r\nis presented every hour, of which some new diversion may be asked for\r\nevery day. If it were thus, the Cause of God would become mere child's\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n\"The 'ulamas must, therefore, assemble, and, with one accord, choose one\r\nmiracle, and write that, after the performance of this miracle they will\r\nno longer entertain doubts about Me, and that all will acknowledge and\r\nconfess the truth of My Cause. Let them seal this paper, and bring it to\r\nMe. This must be the accepted criterion: if the miracle is performed, no\r\ndoubt will remain for them; and if not, We shall be convicted of\r\nimposture.\" The learned man, Hasan 'Amu, rose and replied, \"There is no\r\nmore to be said\"; he then kissed the knee of the Blessed One although he\r\nwas not a believer, and went. He gathered the 'ulama and gave them the\r\nsacred message. They consulted together and said, \"This man is an\r\nenchanter; perhaps he will perform an enchantment, and then we shall have\r\nnothing more to say.\" Acting on this belief, they did not dare to push the\r\nmatter further.(19)\r\n\r\nThis man, Hasan 'Amu, mentioned this fact at many meetings. After leaving\r\nKarbila he went to Kirman_sh_ah and Tihran and spread a detailed account\r\nof it everywhere, laying emphasis on the fear and the withdrawal of the\r\n'ulama.\r\n\r\nBriefly, all His adversaries in the Orient acknowledged His greatness,\r\ngrandeur, knowledge and virtue; and though they were His enemies, they\r\nalways spoke of Him as \"the renowned Baha'u'llah.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time when this great Light suddenly arose upon the horizon of\r\nPersia, all the people, the ministers, the 'ulama and men of other classes\r\nrose against Him, pursuing Him with the greatest animosity, and\r\nproclaiming \"that this man wishes to suppress and destroy the religion,\r\nthe law, the nation and the empire.\" The same was said of Christ. But\r\nBaha'u'llah alone and without support resisted them all, without ever\r\nshowing the least weakness. At last they said, \"As long as this man is in\r\nPersia, there will be no peace and tranquillity; we must banish him, so\r\nthat Persia may return to a state of quietude.\"\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to use violence toward Him to oblige Him to ask for\r\npermission to leave Persia, thinking that by this means the light of His\r\ntruth would be extinguished, but the result was quite the contrary. The\r\nCause became magnified, and its flame more intense. At first it spread\r\nthroughout Persia only, but the exile of Baha'u'llah caused the diffusion\r\nof the Cause throughout other countries. Afterward His enemies said,\r\n\"'Iraq-i-'Arab(20) is not far enough from Persia; we must send him to a\r\nmore distant kingdom.\" This is why the Persian government determined to\r\nsend Baha'u'llah from 'Iraq to Constantinople. Again the event proved that\r\nthe Cause was not in the least weakened. Once more they said,\r\n\"Constantinople is a place of passage and of sojourn for various races and\r\npeoples; among them are many Persians.\" For this reason the Persians had\r\nHim further exiled to Rumelia; but, when there, the flame became more\r\npowerful, and the Cause more exalted. At last the Persians said, \"Not one\r\nof these places is safe from his influence; we must send him to some place\r\nwhere he will be reduced to powerlessness, and where his family and\r\nfollowers will have to submit to the direst afflictions.\" So they chose\r\nthe prison of Akka, which is reserved especially for murderers, thieves\r\nand highway robbers, and in truth they classed Him with such people. But\r\nthe power of God became manifested: His word was promulgated, and the\r\ngreatness of Baha'u'llah then became evident, for it was from this prison\r\nand under such humiliating circumstances that He caused Persia to advance\r\nfrom one state into another state. He overcame all His enemies and proved\r\nto them that they could not resist the Cause. His holy teachings\r\npenetrated all regions, and His Cause was established.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in all parts of Persia His enemies arose against Him with the\r\ngreatest hatred, imprisoning, killing and beating His converts, and\r\nburning and razing to the ground thousands of dwellings, striving by every\r\nmeans to exterminate and crush the Cause. In spite of all this, from the\r\nprison of murderers, highway robbers and thieves, it became exalted. His\r\nteachings were spread abroad, and His exhortations affected many of those\r\nwho had been the most full of hatred, and made them firm believers. Even\r\nthe Persian government itself became awakened and regretted that which had\r\narisen through the fault of the 'ulama.\r\n\r\nWhen Baha'u'llah came to this prison in the Holy Land, the wise men\r\nrealized that the glad tidings which God gave through the tongue of the\r\nProphets two or three thousand years before were again manifested, and\r\nthat God was faithful to His promise; for to some of the Prophets He had\r\nrevealed and given the good news that \"the Lord of Hosts should be\r\nmanifested in the Holy Land.\" All these promises were fulfilled; and it is\r\ndifficult to understand how Baha'u'llah could have been obliged to leave\r\nPersia, and to pitch His tent in this Holy Land, but for the persecution\r\nof His enemies, His banishment and exile. His enemies intended that His\r\nimprisonment should completely destroy and annihilate the blessed Cause,\r\nbut this prison was in reality of the greatest assistance and became the\r\nmeans of its development. The divine renown of Baha'u'llah reached the\r\nEast and the West, and the rays of the Sun of Truth illuminated all the\r\nworld. Praise be to God! though He was a prisoner, His tent was raised on\r\nMount Carmel, and He moved abroad with the greatest majesty. Every person,\r\nfriend or stranger, who came into His presence used to say, \"This is a\r\nprince, not a captive.\"\r\n\r\nUpon His arrival in prison(21) He addressed an epistle to Napoleon,(22)\r\nwhich He sent through the French ambassador. The gist of it was, \"Ask what\r\nis Our crime, and why We are confined in this prison and this dungeon.\"\r\nNapoleon made no reply. Then a second epistle was issued, which is\r\ncontained in the Suriy-i-Haykal.(23) The epitome of it is: \"Oh Napoleon,\r\nas thou hast not listened to My proclamation, and as thou hast not\r\nanswered it, thy dominion will before long be taken away from thee, and\r\nthou wilt be utterly destroyed.\" This epistle was sent to Napoleon by\r\npost, through the care of Cesar Ketaphakou,(24) as was known to all the\r\ncompanions of His exile. The text of this warning reached the whole of\r\nPersia, for it was at that time that the Kitab-i-Haykal was spread in\r\nPersia, and this epistle was among the contents of this book. This\r\nhappened in A.D. 1869, and as this Suriy-i-Haykal was circulated in Persia\r\nand India and was in the hands of all believers, they were waiting to see\r\nwhat would come to pass. Not long after, in A.D. 1870, the war between\r\nGermany and France broke out; and though no one at that time expected the\r\nvictory of Germany, Napoleon was defeated and dishonored; he surrendered\r\nto his enemies, and his glory was changed into deep abasement.\r\n\r\nTablets(25) were also sent to other kings, and among them was the letter\r\nto H. M. Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah. In that epistle Baha'u'llah said, \"Have Me\r\nsummoned, gather the 'ulama, and ask for proofs and arguments, so that the\r\ntruth and falsehood may become known.\" H. M. Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah sent the\r\nblessed epistle to the 'ulama and proposed to them that they should\r\nundertake this mission, but they dared not do so. Then he asked seven of\r\nthe most celebrated among them to write an answer to the challenge. After\r\nsome time they returned the blessed letter, saying, \"This man is the\r\nopposer of religion and the enemy of the _Sh_ah.\" His majesty the _Sh_ah\r\nof Persia was much vexed, and said, \"This is a question for proofs and\r\narguments, and of truth or falsehood: what has it to do with enmity to the\r\ngovernment? Alas! how much we respected these 'ulama, who cannot even\r\nreply to this epistle.\"\r\n\r\nBriefly, all that was recorded in the Tablets to the Kings is being\r\nfulfilled: if from the year A.D. 1870 we compare the events that have\r\noccurred, we will find everything that has happened has appeared as\r\npredicted; only a few remain which will afterward become manifested.\r\n\r\nSo also foreign peoples, and other sects who were not believers,\r\nattributed many wonderful things to Baha'u'llah. Some believed that He was\r\na saint,(26) and some even wrote treatises about Him. One of them, Siyyid\r\nDavudi, a Sunnite savant of Ba_gh_dad, wrote a short treatise in which he\r\nrelated certain supernatural acts of Baha'u'llah. Even now, in all parts\r\nof the East, there are some people who, though they do not believe in His\r\nmanifestation, nevertheless believe Him to be a saint and relate miracles\r\nattributed to Him.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, both His antagonists and His partisans, as well as all those\r\nwho were received in the sacred spot, acknowledged and bore witness to the\r\ngreatness of Baha'u'llah. Though they did not believe in Him, still they\r\nacknowledged His grandeur, and as soon as they entered the sacred spot,\r\nthe presence of Baha'u'llah produced such an effect on most of them that\r\nthey could not utter a word. How many times it happened that one of His\r\nmost bitter enemies would resolve within himself, \"I will say such and\r\nsuch things when I reach His presence, and I will dispute and argue thus\r\nwith Him,\" but when he entered the Holy Presence, he would become amazed\r\nand confounded, and remain speechless.\r\n\r\nBaha'u'llah had never studied Arabic; He had not had a tutor or teacher,\r\nnor had He entered a school. Nevertheless, the eloquence and elegance of\r\nHis blessed expositions in Arabic, as well as His Arabic writings, caused\r\nastonishment and stupefaction to the most accomplished Arabic scholars,\r\nand all recognized and declared that He was incomparable and unequaled.\r\n\r\nIf we carefully examine the text of the Torah, we see that the Divine\r\nManifestation never said to those who denied Him, \"Whatever miracle you\r\ndesire, I am ready to perform, and I will submit to whatever test you\r\npropose.\" But in the Epistle to the _Sh_ah, Baha'u'llah said clearly,\r\n\"Gather the 'ulama, and summon Me, that the evidences and proofs may be\r\nestablished.\"(27)\r\n\r\nFor fifty years Baha'u'llah faced His enemies like a mountain: all wished\r\nto annihilate Him and sought His destruction. A thousand times they\r\nplanned to crucify and destroy Him, and during these fifty years He was in\r\nconstant danger.\r\n\r\nIn this day Persia is in such a state of decadence and ruin that all\r\nintelligent men, whether Persians or foreigners, who realize the true\r\nstate of affairs, recognize that its progress, its civilization and its\r\nreconstruction depend upon the promulgation of the teachings and the\r\ndevelopment of the principles of this great Personage.\r\n\r\nChrist, in His blessed day, in reality only educated eleven men: the\r\ngreatest of them was Peter, who, nevertheless, when he was tested, thrice\r\ndenied Christ. In spite of this, the Cause of Christ subsequently\r\npermeated the world. At the present day Baha'u'llah has educated thousands\r\nof souls who, while under the menace of the sword, raised to the highest\r\nheaven the cry of \"Ya Baha'u'l-Abha\";(28) and in the fire of tests, their\r\nfaces became illuminated like gold. Then reflect what will take place in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must be just and acknowledge what an Educator this Glorious\r\nBeing was, what marvelous signs were manifested by Him, and what power and\r\nmight have been realized in the world through Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: TRADITIONAL PROOFS EXEMPLIFIED FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL\r\n\r\n\r\nToday, at table, let us speak for a little of proofs. If you had come to\r\nthis blessed place in the days of the manifestation of the evident\r\nLight,(29) if you had attained to the court of His presence, and had\r\nwitnessed His luminous beauty, you would have understood that His\r\nteachings and perfection were not in need of further evidence.\r\n\r\nOnly through the honor of entering His presence, many souls became\r\nconfirmed believers; they had no need of other proofs. Even those people\r\nwho rejected and hated Him bitterly, when they had met Him, would testify\r\nto the grandeur of Baha'u'llah, saying, \"This is a magnificent man, but\r\nwhat a pity that he makes such a claim! Otherwise, all that he says is\r\nacceptable.\"\r\n\r\nBut now, as that Light of Reality has set, all are in need of proofs; so\r\nwe have undertaken to demonstrate rational proofs of the truth of His\r\nclaim. We will cite another which alone is sufficient for all who are\r\njust, and which no one can deny. It is that this illustrious Being\r\nuplifted His Cause in the \"Greatest Prison\";(30) from this Prison His\r\nlight was shed abroad, His fame conquered the world, and the proclamation\r\nof His glory reached the East and West. Until our time no such thing has\r\never occurred.\r\n\r\nIf there be justice, this will be acknowledged; but there are some people\r\nwho, even if all the proofs in the world be adduced before them, still\r\nwill not judge justly!\r\n\r\nThus nations and states with all their strength could not resist Him.\r\nVerily, single and alone, imprisoned and oppressed, He accomplished\r\nwhatever He desired.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to mention the miracles of Baha'u'llah, for it may perhaps\r\nbe said that these are traditions, liable both to truth and to error, like\r\nthe accounts of the miracles of Christ in the Gospel, which come to us\r\nfrom the apostles, and not from anyone else, and are denied by the Jews.\r\nThough if I wish to mention the supernatural acts of Baha'u'llah, they are\r\nnumerous; they are acknowledged in the Orient, and even by some\r\nnon-Baha'is. But these narratives are not decisive proofs and evidences to\r\nall; the hearer might perhaps say that this account may not be in\r\naccordance with what occurred, for it is known that other sects recount\r\nmiracles performed by their founders. For instance, the followers of\r\nBrahmanism relate miracles. From what evidence may we know that those are\r\nfalse and that these are true? If these are fables, the others also are\r\nfables; if these are generally accepted, so also the others are generally\r\naccepted. Consequently, these accounts are not satisfactory proofs. Yes,\r\nmiracles are proofs for the eyewitness only, and even he may regard them\r\nnot as a miracle but as an enchantment. Extraordinary feats have also been\r\nrelated of some conjurors.\r\n\r\nBriefly, my meaning is that many wonderful things were done by\r\nBaha'u'llah, but we do not recount them, as they do not constitute proofs\r\nand evidences for all the peoples of the earth, and they are not decisive\r\nproofs even for those who see them: they may think that they are merely\r\nenchantments.\r\n\r\nAlso, most of the miracles of the Prophets which are mentioned have an\r\ninner significance. For instance, in the Gospel it is written that at the\r\nmartyrdom of Christ darkness prevailed, and the earth quaked, and the veil\r\nof the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the dead\r\ncame forth from their graves. If these events had happened, they would\r\nindeed have been awesome, and would certainly have been recorded in the\r\nhistory of the times. They would have become the cause of much troublings\r\nof heart. Either the soldiers would have taken down Christ from the cross,\r\nor they would have fled. These events are not related in any history;\r\ntherefore, it is evident they ought not to be taken literally, but as\r\nhaving an inner significance.(31)\r\n\r\nOur purpose is not to deny such miracles; our only meaning is that they do\r\nnot constitute decisive proofs, and that they have an inner significance.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, today, at table, we will refer to the explanation of the\r\ntraditional proofs which are in the Holy Books. Until now, all that we\r\nhave spoken of are rational proofs.\r\n\r\nThe state in which one should be to seriously search for the truth is the\r\ncondition of the thirsty, burning soul desiring the water of life, of the\r\nfish struggling to reach the sea, of the sufferer seeking for the true\r\ndoctor to obtain the divine cure, of the lost caravan endeavoring to find\r\nthe right road, of the lost and wandering ship striving to reach the shore\r\nof salvation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the seeker must be endowed with certain qualities. First of\r\nall, he must be just and severed from all else save God; his heart must be\r\nentirely turned to the supreme horizon; he must be free from the bondage\r\nof self and passion, for all these are obstacles. Furthermore, he must be\r\nable to endure all hardships. He must be absolutely pure and sanctified,\r\nand free from the love or the hatred of the inhabitants of the world. Why?\r\nbecause the fact of his love for any person or thing might prevent him\r\nfrom recognizing the truth in another, and, in the same way, hatred for\r\nanything might be a hindrance in discerning truth. This is the condition\r\nof seeking, and the seeker must have these qualities and attributes. Until\r\nhe reaches this condition, it is not possible for him to attain to the Sun\r\nof Reality.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to our subject.\r\n\r\nAll the peoples of the world are awaiting two Manifestations, Who must be\r\ncontemporaneous; all wait for the fulfillment of this promise. In the\r\nBible the Jews have the promise of the Lord of Hosts and the Messiah; in\r\nthe Gospel the return of Christ and Elijah is promised.\r\n\r\nIn the religion of Muhammad there is the promise of the Mihdi and the\r\nMessiah, and it is the same with the Zoroastrian and the other religions,\r\nbut if we relate these matters in detail, it would take too long. The\r\nessential fact is that all are promised two Manifestations, Who will come,\r\none following on the other. It has been prophesied that in the time of\r\nthese two Manifestations the earth will be transformed, the world of\r\nexistence will be renewed, and beings will be clothed in new garments.\r\nJustice and truth will encompass the world; enmity and hatred will\r\ndisappear; all causes of division among peoples, races and nations will\r\nvanish; and the cause of union, harmony and concord will appear. The\r\nnegligent will awake, the blind will see, the deaf will hear, the dumb\r\nwill speak, the sick will be cured, the dead will arise. War will give\r\nplace to peace, enmity will be conquered by love, the causes of dispute\r\nand wrangling will be entirely removed, and true felicity will be\r\nattained. The world will become the mirror of the Heavenly Kingdom;\r\nhumanity will be the Throne of Divinity. All nations will become one; all\r\nreligions will be unified; all individual men will become of one family\r\nand of one kindred. All the regions of the earth will become one; the\r\nsuperstitions caused by races, countries, individuals, languages and\r\npolitics will disappear; and all men will attain to life eternal, under\r\nthe shadow of the Lord of Hosts.\r\n\r\nNow we must prove from the Holy Books that these two Manifestations have\r\ncome, and we must divine the meaning of the words of the Prophets, for we\r\nwish for proofs drawn from the Holy Books.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, at table, we put forth rational proofs establishing the\r\ntruth of these two Manifestations.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: in the Book of Daniel, from the rebuilding of Jerusalem to\r\nthe martyrdom of Christ, seventy weeks are appointed; for by the martyrdom\r\nof Christ the sacrifice is accomplished and the altar destroyed.(32) This\r\nis a prophecy of the manifestation of Christ. These seventy weeks begin\r\nwith the restoration and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, concerning which\r\nfour edicts were issued by three kings.\r\n\r\nThe first was issued by Cyrus in the year 536 B.C.; this is recorded in\r\nthe first chapter of the Book of Ezra. The second edict, with reference to\r\nthe rebuilding of Jerusalem, is that of Darius of Persia in the year 519\r\nB.C.; this is recorded in the sixth chapter of Ezra. The third is that of\r\nArtaxerxes in the seventh year of his reign--that is, in 457 B.C.; this is\r\nrecorded in the seventh chapter of Ezra. The fourth is that of Artaxerxes\r\nin the year 444 B.C.; this is recorded in the second chapter of Nehemiah.\r\n\r\nBut Daniel refers especially to the third edict which was issued in the\r\nyear 457 B.C. Seventy weeks make four hundred and ninety days. Each day,\r\naccording to the text of the Holy Book, is a year. For in the Bible it is\r\nsaid: \"The day of the Lord is one year.\"(33) Therefore, four hundred and\r\nninety days are four hundred and ninety years. The third edict of\r\nArtaxerxes was issued four hundred and fifty-seven years before the birth\r\nof Christ, and Christ when He was martyred and ascended was thirty-three\r\nyears of age. When you add thirty-three to four hundred and fifty-seven,\r\nthe result is four hundred and ninety, which is the time announced by\r\nDaniel for the manifestation of Christ.\r\n\r\nBut in the twenty-fifth verse of the ninth chapter of the Book of Daniel\r\nthis is expressed in another manner, as seven weeks and sixty-two weeks;\r\nand apparently this differs from the first saying. Many have remained\r\nperplexed at these differences, trying to reconcile these two statements.\r\nHow can seventy weeks be right in one place, and sixty-two weeks and seven\r\nweeks in another? These two sayings do not accord.\r\n\r\nBut Daniel mentions two dates. One of these dates begins with the command\r\nof Artaxerxes to Ezra to rebuild Jerusalem: this is the seventy weeks\r\nwhich came to an end with the ascension of Christ, when by His martyrdom\r\nthe sacrifice and oblation ceased.\r\n\r\nThe second period, which is found in the twenty-sixth verse, means that\r\nafter the termination of the rebuilding of Jerusalem until the ascension\r\nof Christ, there will be sixty-two weeks: the seven weeks are the duration\r\nof the rebuilding of Jerusalem, which took forty-nine years. When you add\r\nthese seven weeks to the sixty-two weeks, it makes sixty-nine weeks, and\r\nin the last week (69-70) the ascension of Christ took place. These seventy\r\nweeks are thus completed, and there is no contradiction.\r\n\r\nNow that the manifestation of Christ has been proved by the prophecies of\r\nDaniel, let us prove the manifestations of Baha'u'llah and of the Bab. Up\r\nto the present we have only mentioned rational proofs; now we shall speak\r\nof traditional proofs.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth chapter of the Book of Daniel, verse thirteen, it is said:\r\n\"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain\r\nsaint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily\r\nsacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary\r\nand the host to be trodden under foot?\" Then he answered (v. 14): \"Unto\r\ntwo thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be\r\ncleansed\"; (v. 17) \"But he said unto me ... at the time of the end shall\r\nbe the vision.\" That is to say, how long will this misfortune, this ruin,\r\nthis abasement and degradation last? meaning, when will be the dawn of the\r\nManifestation? Then he answered, \"Two thousand and three hundred days;\r\nthen shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\" Briefly, the purport of this\r\npassage is that he appoints two thousand three hundred years, for in the\r\ntext of the Bible each day is a year. Then from the date of the issuing of\r\nthe edict of Artaxerxes to rebuild Jerusalem until the day of the birth of\r\nChrist there are 456 years, and from the birth of Christ until the day of\r\nthe manifestation of the Bab there are 1844 years. When you add 456 years\r\nto this number it makes 2300 years. That is to say, the fulfillment of the\r\nvision of Daniel took place in the year A.D. 1844, and this is the year of\r\nthe Bab's manifestation according to the actual text of the Book of\r\nDaniel. Consider how clearly he determines the year of manifestation;\r\nthere could be no clearer prophecy for a manifestation than this.\r\n\r\nIn Matthew, chapter 24, verse 3, Christ clearly says that what Daniel\r\nmeant by this prophecy was the date of the manifestation, and this is the\r\nverse: \"As He sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto Him\r\nprivately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be\r\nthe sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?\" One of the\r\nexplanations He gave them in reply was this (v. 15): \"When ye therefore\r\nshall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet,\r\nstand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand).\" In this\r\nanswer He referred them to the eighth chapter of the Book of Daniel,\r\nsaying that everyone who reads it will understand that it is this time\r\nthat is spoken of. Consider how clearly the manifestation of the Bab is\r\nspoken of in the Old Testament and in the Gospel.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, let us now explain the date of the manifestation of\r\nBaha'u'llah from the Bible. The date of Baha'u'llah is calculated\r\naccording to lunar years from the mission and the Hejira of Muhammad; for\r\nin the religion of Muhammad the lunar year is in use, as also it is the\r\nlunar year which is employed concerning all commands of worship.\r\n\r\nIn Daniel, chapter 12, verse 6, it is said: \"And one said to the man\r\nclothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall\r\nit be to the end of these wonders? And I heard the man clothed in linen,\r\nwhich was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and\r\nhis left hand unto heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever that it\r\nshall be for a time, times, and a half; and that when He shall have\r\naccomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things\r\nshall be finished.\"(34)\r\n\r\nAs I have already explained the signification of one day, it is not\r\nnecessary to explain it further; but we will say briefly that each day of\r\nthe Father counts as a year, and in each year there are twelve months.\r\nThus three years and a half make forty-two months, and forty-two months\r\nare twelve hundred and sixty days. The Bab, the precursor of Baha'u'llah,\r\nappeared in the year 1260 from the Hejira of Muhammad, by the reckoning of\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\nAfterward, in verse 11, it is said: \"And from the time that the daily\r\nsacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolation\r\nbe set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Blessed\r\nis he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and\r\nthirty days.\"(35)\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this lunar reckoning is from the day of the proclamation\r\nof the prophethood of Muhammad in the country of Hijaz; and that was three\r\nyears after His mission, because in the beginning the prophethood of\r\nMuhammad was kept secret, and no one knew it save _Kh_adijah and Ibn\r\nNawfal.(36) After three years it was announced. And Baha'u'llah, in the\r\nyear 1290 from the proclamation of the mission of Muhammad, caused His\r\nmanifestation to be known.(37)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: COMMENTARY ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the eleventh chapter of the Revelation of St. John it\r\nis said:\r\n\r\n\"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood,\r\nsaying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that\r\nworship therein.\r\n\r\n\"But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not;\r\nfor it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread\r\nunder foot forty and two months.\"\r\n\r\nThis reed is a Perfect Man Who is likened to a reed, and the manner of its\r\nlikeness is this: when the interior of a reed is empty and free from all\r\nmatter, it will produce beautiful melodies; and as the sound and melodies\r\ndo not come from the reed, but from the flute player who blows upon it, so\r\nthe sanctified heart of that blessed Being is free and emptied from all\r\nsave God, pure and exempt from the attachments of all human conditions,\r\nand is the companion of the Divine Spirit. Whatever He utters is not from\r\nHimself, but from the real flute player, and it is a divine inspiration.\r\nThat is why He is likened to a reed; and that reed is like a rod--that is\r\nto say, it is the helper of every impotent one, and the support of human\r\nbeings. It is the rod of the Divine Shepherd by which He guards His flock\r\nand leads them about the pastures of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThen it is said: \"The angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of\r\nGod, and the altar, and them that worship therein\"--that is to say, compare\r\nand measure: measuring is the discovery of proportion. Thus the angel\r\nsaid: compare the temple of God and the altar and them that are praying\r\ntherein--that is to say, investigate what is their true condition and\r\ndiscover in what degree and state they are, and what conditions,\r\nperfections, behavior and attributes they possess; and make yourself\r\ncognizant of the mysteries of those holy souls who dwell in the Holy of\r\nHolies in purity and sanctity.\r\n\r\n\"But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not;\r\nfor it is given unto the Gentiles.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the seventh century after Christ, when Jerusalem was\r\nconquered, the Holy of Holies was outwardly preserved--that is to say, the\r\nhouse which Solomon built; but outside the Holy of Holies the outer court\r\nwas taken and given to the Gentiles. \"And the holy city shall they tread\r\nunder foot forty and two months\"--that is to say, the Gentiles shall govern\r\nand control Jerusalem forty and two months, signifying twelve hundred and\r\nsixty days; and as each day signifies a year, by this reckoning it becomes\r\ntwelve hundred and sixty years, which is the duration of the cycle of the\r\nQur'an. For in the texts of the Holy Book, each day is a year; as it is\r\nsaid in the fourth chapter of Ezekiel, verse 6: \"Thou shalt bear the\r\niniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day\r\nfor a year.\"\r\n\r\nThis prophesies the duration of the Dispensation of Islam when Jerusalem\r\nwas trodden under foot, which means that it lost its glory--but the Holy of\r\nHolies was preserved, guarded and respected--until the year 1260. This\r\ntwelve hundred and sixty years is a prophecy of the manifestation of the\r\nBab, the \"Gate\" of Baha'u'llah, which took place in the year 1260 of the\r\nHejira of Muhammad, and as the period of twelve hundred and sixty years\r\nhas expired, Jerusalem, the Holy City, is now beginning to become\r\nprosperous, populous and flourishing. Anyone who saw Jerusalem sixty years\r\nago, and who sees it now, will recognize how populous and flourishing it\r\nhas become, and how it is again honored.\r\n\r\nThis is the outward meaning of these verses of the Revelation of St. John;\r\nbut they have another explanation and a symbolic sense, which is as\r\nfollows: the Law of God is divided into two parts. One is the fundamental\r\nbasis which comprises all spiritual things--that is to say, it refers to\r\nthe spiritual virtues and divine qualities; this does not change nor\r\nalter: it is the Holy of Holies, which is the essence of the Law of Adam,\r\nNoah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, the Bab, and Baha'u'llah, and\r\nwhich lasts and is established in all the prophetic cycles. It will never\r\nbe abrogated, for it is spiritual and not material truth; it is faith,\r\nknowledge, certitude, justice, piety, righteousness, trustworthiness, love\r\nof God, benevolence, purity, detachment, humility, meekness, patience and\r\nconstancy. It shows mercy to the poor, defends the oppressed, gives to the\r\nwretched and uplifts the fallen.\r\n\r\nThese divine qualities, these eternal commandments, will never be\r\nabolished; nay, they will last and remain established for ever and ever.\r\nThese virtues of humanity will be renewed in each of the different cycles;\r\nfor at the end of every cycle the spiritual Law of God--that is to say, the\r\nhuman virtues--disappears, and only the form subsists.\r\n\r\nThus among the Jews, at the end of the cycle of Moses, which coincides\r\nwith the Christian manifestation, the Law of God disappeared, only a form\r\nwithout spirit remaining. The Holy of Holies departed from among them, but\r\nthe outer court of Jerusalem--which is the expression used for the form of\r\nthe religion--fell into the hands of the Gentiles. In the same way, the\r\nfundamental principles of the religion of Christ, which are the greatest\r\nvirtues of humanity, have disappeared; and its form has remained in the\r\nhands of the clergy and the priests. Likewise, the foundation of the\r\nreligion of Muhammad has disappeared, but its form remains in the hands of\r\nthe official 'ulama.\r\n\r\nThese foundations of the Religion of God, which are spiritual and which\r\nare the virtues of humanity, cannot be abrogated; they are irremovable and\r\neternal, and are renewed in the cycle of every Prophet.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the Religion of God, which refers to the material\r\nworld, and which comprises fasting, prayer, forms of worship, marriage and\r\ndivorce, the abolition of slavery, legal processes, transactions,\r\nindemnities for murder, violence, theft and injuries--this part of the Law\r\nof God, which refers to material things, is modified and altered in each\r\nprophetic cycle in accordance with the necessities of the times.\r\n\r\nBriefly, what is meant by the term Holy of Holies is that spiritual Law\r\nwhich will never be modified, altered or abrogated; and the Holy City\r\nmeans the material Law which may be abrogated; and this material Law,\r\nwhich is described as the Holy City, was to be trodden under foot for\r\ntwelve hundred and sixty years.\r\n\r\n\"And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a\r\nthousand two hundred and three-score days, clothed in sackcloth.\"(38)\r\nThese two witnesses are Muhammad the Messenger of God, and 'Ali, son of\r\nAbu Talib.\r\n\r\nIn the Qur'an it is said that God addressed Muhammad, the Messenger of\r\nGod, saying: \"We made You a Witness, a Herald of good news, and a\r\nWarner\"--that is to say, We have established Thee as the witness, the giver\r\nof good tidings, and as One bringing the wrath of God.(39) The meaning of\r\n\"a witness\" is one by whose testimony things may be verified. The commands\r\nof these two witnesses were to be performed for twelve hundred and sixty\r\ndays, each day signifying a year. Now, Muhammad was the root, and 'Ali the\r\nbranch, like Moses and Joshua. It is said they \"are clothed in sackcloth,\"\r\nmeaning that they, apparently, were to be clothed in old raiment, not in\r\nnew raiment; in other words, in the beginning they would possess no\r\nsplendor in the eyes of the people, nor would their Cause appear new; for\r\nMuhammad's spiritual Law corresponds to that of Christ in the Gospel, and\r\nmost of His laws relating to material things correspond to those of the\r\nPentateuch. This is the meaning of the old raiment.\r\n\r\nThen it is said: \"These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks\r\nstanding before the God of the earth.\"(40) These two souls are likened to\r\nolive trees because at that time all lamps were lighted by olive oil. The\r\nmeaning is two persons from whom that spirit of the wisdom of God, which\r\nis the cause of the illumination of the world, appears. These lights of\r\nGod were to radiate and shine; therefore, they are likened to two\r\ncandlesticks: the candlestick is the abode of the light, and from it the\r\nlight shines forth. In the same way the light of guidance would shine and\r\nradiate from these illumined souls.\r\n\r\nThen it is said: \"They are standing before God,\" meaning that they are\r\nstanding in the service of God, and educating the creatures of God, such\r\nas the barbarous nomad Arab tribes of the Arabian peninsula, whom they\r\neducated in such a way that in those days they reached the highest degree\r\nof civilization, and their fame and renown became worldwide.\r\n\r\n\"And if any man would hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and\r\ndevoureth their enemies.\"(41) That is to say, that no one would be able to\r\nwithstand them, that if a person wished to belittle their teachings and\r\ntheir law, he would be surrounded and exterminated by this same law which\r\nproceedeth out of their mouth; and everyone who attempted to injure, to\r\nantagonize and to hate them would be destroyed by a command which would\r\ncome out of their mouth. And thus it happened: all their enemies were\r\nvanquished, put to flight and annihilated. In this most evident way God\r\nassisted them.\r\n\r\nAfterward it is said: \"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not\r\nin the days of their prophecy,\"(42) meaning that in that cycle they would\r\nbe like kings. The law and teachings of Muhammad, and the explanations and\r\ncommentaries of 'Ali, are a heavenly bounty; if they wish to give this\r\nbounty, they have power to do so. If they do not wish it, the rain will\r\nnot fall: in this connection rain stands for bounty.\r\n\r\nThen it is said: \"They have power over water to turn it to blood,\"(43)\r\nmeaning that the prophethood of Muhammad was the same as that of Moses,\r\nand that the power of 'Ali was the same as that of Joshua: if they wished,\r\nthey could turn the water of the Nile into blood, so far as the Egyptians\r\nand those who denied them were concerned--that is to say, that that which\r\nwas the cause of their life, through their ignorance and pride, became the\r\ncause of their death. So the kingdom, wealth and power of Pharaoh and his\r\npeople, which were the causes of the life of the nation, became, through\r\ntheir opposition, denial and pride, the cause of death, destruction,\r\ndispersion, degradation and poverty. Hence these two witnesses have power\r\nto destroy the nations.\r\n\r\nThen it is said: \"And smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they\r\nwill,\"(44) meaning that they also would have the power and the material\r\nforce necessary to educate the wicked and those who are oppressors and\r\ntyrants, for to these two witnesses God granted both outward and inward\r\npower, that they might educate and correct the ferocious, bloodthirsty,\r\ntyrannical nomad Arabs, who were like beasts of prey.\r\n\r\n\"And when they shall have finished their testimony\"(45) means when they\r\nshould have performed that which they are commanded, and should have\r\ndelivered the divine message, promoting the Law of God and propagating the\r\nheavenly teachings, to the intent that the signs of spiritual life might\r\nbe manifest in souls, and the light of the virtues of the world of\r\nhumanity might shine forth, until complete development should be brought\r\nabout among the nomad tribes.\r\n\r\n\"The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall war against\r\nthem, and shall overcome them, and kill them\":(46) this beast means the\r\nUmayyads who attacked them from the pit of error, and who rose against the\r\nreligion of Muhammad and against the reality of 'Ali--in other words, the\r\nlove of God.\r\n\r\nIt is said, \"The beast made war against these two witnesses\"(47)--that is\r\nto say, a spiritual war, meaning that the beast would act in entire\r\nopposition to the teachings, customs and institutions of these two\r\nwitnesses, to such an extent that the virtues and perfections which were\r\ndiffused by the power of those two witnesses among the peoples and tribes\r\nwould be entirely dispelled, and the animal nature and carnal desires\r\nwould conquer. Therefore, this beast making war against them would gain\r\nthe victory--meaning that the darkness of error coming from this beast was\r\nto have ascendency over the horizons of the world, and kill those two\r\nwitnesses--in other words, that it would destroy the spiritual life which\r\nthey spread abroad in the midst of the nation, and entirely remove the\r\ndivine laws and teachings, treading under foot the Religion of God.\r\nNothing would thereafter remain but a lifeless body without spirit.\r\n\r\n\"And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which\r\nspiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was\r\ncrucified.\"(48) \"Their bodies\" means the Religion of God, and \"the street\"\r\nmeans in public view. The meaning of \"Sodom and Egypt,\" the place \"where\r\nalso our Lord was crucified,\" is this region of Syria, and especially\r\nJerusalem, where the Umayyads then had their dominions; and it was here\r\nthat the Religion of God and the divine teachings first disappeared, and a\r\nbody without spirit remained. \"Their bodies\" represents the Religion of\r\nGod, which remained like a dead body without spirit.\r\n\r\n\"And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see\r\ntheir dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead\r\nbodies to be put in graves.\"(49)\r\n\r\nAs it was before explained, in the terminology of the Holy Books three\r\ndays and a half signify three years and a half, and three years and a half\r\nare forty and two months, and forty and two months twelve hundred and\r\nsixty days; and as each day by the text of the Holy Book signifies one\r\nyear, the meaning is that for twelve hundred and sixty years, which is the\r\ncycle of the Qur'an, the nations, tribes and peoples would look at their\r\nbodies--that is to say, that they would make a spectacle of the Religion of\r\nGod: though they would not act in accordance with it, still, they would\r\nnot suffer their bodies--meaning the Religion of God--to be put in the\r\ngrave. That is to say, that in appearance they would cling to the Religion\r\nof God and not allow it to completely disappear from their midst, nor the\r\nbody of it to be entirely destroyed and annihilated. Nay, in reality they\r\nwould leave it, while outwardly preserving its name and remembrance.\r\n\r\nThose \"kindreds, people and nations\" signify those who are gathered under\r\nthe shadow of the Qur'an, not permitting the Cause and Law of God to be,\r\nin outward appearance, entirely destroyed and annihilated--for there are\r\nprayer and fasting among them--but the fundamental principles of the\r\nReligion of God, which are morals and conduct, with the knowledge of\r\ndivine mysteries, have disappeared; the light of the virtues of the world\r\nof humanity, which is the result of the love and knowledge of God, is\r\nextinguished; and the darkness of tyranny, oppression, satanic passions\r\nand desires has become victorious. The body of the Law of God, like a\r\ncorpse, has been exposed to public view for twelve hundred and sixty days,\r\neach day being counted as a year, and this period is the cycle of\r\nMuhammad.\r\n\r\nThe people forfeited all that these two persons had established, which was\r\nthe foundation of the Law of God, and destroyed the virtues of the world\r\nof humanity, which are the divine gifts and the spirit of this religion,\r\nto such a degree that truthfulness, justice, love, union, purity,\r\nsanctity, detachment and all the divine qualities departed from among\r\nthem. In the religion only prayers and fasting persisted; this condition\r\nlasted for twelve hundred and sixty years, which is the duration of the\r\ncycle of the Furqan.(50) It was as if these two persons were dead, and\r\ntheir bodies were remaining without spirit.\r\n\r\n\"And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make\r\nmerry, and shall send gifts to one another, because these two prophets\r\ntormented them that dwelt on the earth.\"(51) \"Those who dwelt upon the\r\nearth\" means the other nations and races, such as the peoples of Europe\r\nand distant Asia, who, when they saw that the character of Islam was\r\nentirely changed, the Law of God forsaken--that virtues, zeal and honor had\r\ndeparted from among them, and that their qualities were changed--became\r\nhappy, and rejoiced that corruption of morals had infected the people of\r\nIslam, and that they would in consequence be overcome by other nations. So\r\nthis thing has come to pass. Witness this people which had attained the\r\nsummit of power, how degraded and downtrodden it is now.\r\n\r\nThe other nations \"shall send gifts to one another,\" meaning that they\r\nshould help each other, for \"these two prophets tormented them that dwelt\r\nupon the earth\"--that is, they overcame the other nations and peoples of\r\nthe world and conquered them.\r\n\r\n\"And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into\r\nthem, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that\r\nsaw them.\"(52) Three days and a half, as we before explained, is twelve\r\nhundred and sixty years. Those two persons whose bodies were lying\r\nspiritless are the teachings and the law that Muhammad established and\r\n'Ali promoted, from which, however, the reality had departed and only the\r\nform remained. The spirit came again into them means that those\r\nfoundations and teachings were again established. In other words, the\r\nspirituality of the Religion of God had been changed into materiality, and\r\nvirtues into vices; the love of God had been changed into hatred,\r\nenlightenment into darkness, divine qualities into satanic ones, justice\r\ninto tyranny, mercy into enmity, sincerity into hypocrisy, guidance into\r\nerror, and purity into sensuality. Then after three days and a half, which\r\nby the terminology of the Holy Books is twelve hundred and sixty years,\r\nthese divine teachings, heavenly virtues, perfections and spiritual\r\nbounties were again renewed by the appearance of the Bab and the devotion\r\nof Jinab-i-Quddus.(53)\r\n\r\nThe holy breezes were diffused, the light of truth shone forth, the season\r\nof the life-giving spring came, and the morn of guidance dawned. These two\r\nlifeless bodies again became living, and these two great ones--one the\r\nFounder and the other the promoter--arose and were like two candlesticks,\r\nfor they illumined the world with the light of truth.\r\n\r\n\"And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up\r\nhither. And they ascended up to heaven,\"(54) meaning that from the\r\ninvisible heaven they heard the voice of God, saying: You have performed\r\nall that was proper and fitting in delivering the teachings and glad\r\ntidings; you have given My message to the people and raised the call of\r\nGod, and have accomplished your duty. Now, like Christ, you must sacrifice\r\nyour life for the Well-Beloved, and be martyrs. And that Sun of Reality,\r\nand that Moon of Guidance,(55) both, like Christ, set on the horizon of\r\nthe greatest martyrdom and ascended to the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n\"And their enemies beheld them,\"(56) meaning that many of their enemies,\r\nafter witnessing their martyrdom, realized the sublimity of their station\r\nand the exaltation of their virtue, and testified to their greatness and\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n\"And the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the\r\ncity fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand.\"(57)\r\n\r\nThis earthquake occurred in _Sh_iraz after the martyrdom of the Bab. The\r\ncity was in a turmoil, and many people were destroyed. Great agitation\r\nalso took place through diseases, cholera, dearth, scarcity, famine and\r\nafflictions, the like of which had never been known.\r\n\r\n\"And the remnant was affrighted and gave glory to the God of heaven.\"(58)\r\n\r\nWhen the earthquake took place in Fars, all the remnant lamented and cried\r\nday and night, and were occupied in glorifying and praying to God. They\r\nwere so troubled and affrighted that they had no sleep nor rest at night.\r\n\r\n\"The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.\"(59)\r\nThe first woe is the appearance of the Prophet, Muhammad, the son of\r\n'Abdu'llah--peace be upon Him! The second woe is that of the Bab--to Him be\r\nglory and praise! The third woe is the great day of the manifestation of\r\nthe Lord of Hosts and the radiance of the Beauty of the Promised One. The\r\nexplanation of this subject, woe, is mentioned in the thirtieth chapter of\r\nEzekiel, where it is said: \"The word of the Lord came again unto me,\r\nsaying, Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Howl ye,\r\nWoe worth the day! For the day is near, even the day of the Lord is\r\nnear.\"(60)\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is certain that the day of woe is the day of the Lord; for\r\nin that day woe is for the neglectful, woe is for the sinners, woe is for\r\nthe ignorant. That is why it is said, \"The second woe is past; behold the\r\nthird woe cometh quickly!\" This third woe is the day of the manifestation\r\nof Baha'u'llah, the day of God; and it is near to the day of the\r\nappearance of the Bab.\r\n\r\n\"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven,\r\nsaying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord,\r\nand of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever.\"(61)\r\n\r\nThe seventh angel is a man qualified with heavenly attributes, who will\r\narise with heavenly qualities and character. Voices will be raised, so\r\nthat the appearance of the Divine Manifestation will be proclaimed and\r\ndiffused. In the day of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts, and at the\r\nepoch of the divine cycle of the Omnipotent which is promised and\r\nmentioned in all the books and writings of the Prophets--in that day of\r\nGod, the Spiritual and Divine Kingdom will be established, and the world\r\nwill be renewed; a new spirit will be breathed into the body of creation;\r\nthe season of the divine spring will come; the clouds of mercy will rain;\r\nthe sun of reality will shine; the life-giving breeze will blow; the world\r\nof humanity will wear a new garment; the surface of the earth will be a\r\nsublime paradise; mankind will be educated; wars, disputes, quarrels and\r\nmalignity will disappear; and truthfulness, righteousness, peace and the\r\nworship of God will appear; union, love and brotherhood will surround the\r\nworld; and God will rule for evermore--meaning that the Spiritual and\r\nEverlasting Kingdom will be established. Such is the day of God. For all\r\nthe days which have come and gone were the days of Abraham, Moses and\r\nChrist, or of the other Prophets; but this day is the day of God, for the\r\nSun of Reality will arise in it with the utmost warmth and splendor.\r\n\r\n\"And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell\r\nupon their faces, and worshipped God.\r\n\r\n\"Saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, Which art, and wast,\r\nand art to come; because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power, and hast\r\nreigned.\"(62) In each cycle the guardians and holy souls have been twelve.\r\nSo Jacob had twelve sons; in the time of Moses there were twelve heads or\r\nchiefs of the tribes; in the time of Christ there were twelve Apostles;\r\nand in the time of Muhammad there were twelve Imams. But in this glorious\r\nmanifestation there are twenty-four, double the number of all the others,\r\nfor the greatness of this manifestation requires it. These holy souls are\r\nin the presence of God seated on their own thrones, meaning that they\r\nreign eternally.\r\n\r\nThese twenty-four great persons, though they are seated on the thrones of\r\neverlasting rule, yet are worshipers of the appearance of the universal\r\nManifestation, and they are humble and submissive, saying, \"We give thanks\r\nto Thee, O Lord God Almighty, Which art, and wast, and art to come,\r\nbecause Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power and hast reigned\"--that is\r\nto say, Thou wilt issue all Thy teachings, Thou wilt gather all the people\r\nof the earth under Thy shadow, and Thou wilt bring all men under the\r\nshadow of one tent. Although it is the Eternal Kingdom of God, and He\r\nalways had, and has, a Kingdom, the Kingdom here means the manifestation\r\nof Himself;(63) and He will issue all the laws and teachings which are the\r\nspirit of the world of humanity and everlasting life. And that universal\r\nManifestation will subdue the world by spiritual power, not by war and\r\ncombat; He will do it with peace and tranquillity, not by the sword and\r\narms; He will establish this Heavenly Kingdom by true love, and not by the\r\npower of war. He will promote these divine teachings by kindness and\r\nrighteousness, and not by weapons and harshness. He will so educate the\r\nnations and people that, notwithstanding their various conditions, their\r\ndifferent customs and characters, and their diverse religions and races,\r\nthey will, as it is said in the Bible, like the wolf and the lamb, the\r\nleopard, the kid, the sucking child and the serpent, become comrades,\r\nfriends and companions. The contentions of races, the differences of\r\nreligions, and the barriers between nations will be completely removed,\r\nand all will attain perfect union and reconciliation under the shadow of\r\nthe Blessed Tree.\r\n\r\n\"And the nations were angry,\" for Thy teachings opposed the passions of\r\nthe other peoples; \"and Thy wrath is come\"(64)--that is to say, all will be\r\nafflicted by evident loss; because they do not follow Thy precepts,\r\ncounsels and teachings, they will be deprived of Thy everlasting bounty,\r\nand veiled from the light of the Sun of Reality.\r\n\r\n\"And the time of the dead, that they should be judged\" means that the time\r\nhas come that the dead(65)--that is to say, those who are deprived of the\r\nspirit of the love of God and have not a share of the sanctified eternal\r\nlife--will be judged with justice, meaning they will arise to receive that\r\nwhich they deserve. He will make the reality of their secrets evident,\r\nshowing what a low degree they occupy in the world of existence, and that\r\nin reality they are under the rule of death.\r\n\r\n\"That Thou shouldst give reward unto Thy servants the prophets, and the\r\nsaints, and them that fear Thy name, small and great\"(66)--that is to say,\r\nHe will distinguish the righteous by endless bounty, making them shine on\r\nthe horizon of eternal honor, like the stars of heaven. He will assist\r\nthem by endowing them with behavior and actions which are the light of the\r\nworld of humanity, the cause of guidance, and the means of everlasting\r\nlife in the Divine Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"And shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth\"(67) means that He will\r\nentirely deprive the neglectful; for the blindness of the blind will be\r\nmanifest, and the vision of the seers will be evident; the ignorance and\r\nwant of knowledge of the people of error will be recognized, and the\r\nknowledge and wisdom of the people under guidance will be apparent;\r\nconsequently, the destroyers will be destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"And the temple of God was opened in heaven\"(68) means that the divine\r\nJerusalem is found, and the Holy of Holies has become visible. The Holy of\r\nHolies, according to the terminology of the people of wisdom, is the\r\nessence of the Divine Law, and the heavenly and true teachings of the\r\nLord, which have not been changed in the cycle of any Prophet, as it was\r\nbefore explained. The sanctuary of Jerusalem is likened to the reality of\r\nthe Law of God, which is the Holy of Holies; and all the laws,\r\nconventions, rites and material regulations are the city of Jerusalem--this\r\nis why it is called the heavenly Jerusalem. Briefly, as in this cycle the\r\nSun of Reality will make the light of God shine with the utmost splendor,\r\ntherefore, the essence of the teachings of God will be realized in the\r\nworld of existence, and the darkness of ignorance and want of knowledge\r\nwill be dispelled. The world will become a new world, and enlightenment\r\nwill prevail. So the Holy of Holies will appear.\r\n\r\n\"And the temple of God was opened in heaven\"(69) means also that by the\r\ndiffusion of the divine teachings, the appearance of these heavenly\r\nmysteries, and the rising of the Sun of Reality, the doors of success and\r\nprosperity will be opened in all directions, and the signs of goodness and\r\nheavenly benedictions will be made plain.\r\n\r\n\"And there was seen in His temple the ark of His Testament\"(70)--that is to\r\nsay, the Book of His Testament will appear in His Jerusalem, the Epistle\r\nof the Covenant(71) will be established, and the meaning of the Testament\r\nand of the Covenant will become evident. The renown of God will overspread\r\nthe East and West, and the proclamation of the Cause of God will fill the\r\nworld. The violators of the Covenant will be degraded and dispersed, and\r\nthe faithful cherished and glorified, for they cling to the Book of the\r\nTestament and are firm and steadfast in the Covenant.\r\n\r\n\"And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an\r\nearthquake, and great hail,\"(72) meaning that after the appearance of the\r\nBook of the Testament there will be a great storm, and the lightnings of\r\nthe anger and the wrath of God will flash, the noise of the thunder of the\r\nviolation of the Covenant will resound, the earthquake of doubts will take\r\nplace, the hail of torments will beat upon the violators of the Covenant,\r\nand even those who profess belief will fall into trials and temptations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: COMMENTARY ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF ISAIAH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Isaiah, chapter 11, verses 1 to 10, it is said: \"And there shall come\r\nforth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his\r\nroots: And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of\r\nwisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of\r\nknowledge and of the fear of the Lord; And shall make him of quick\r\nunderstanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the\r\nsight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: But with\r\nrighteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the\r\nmeek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,\r\nand with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And\r\nrighteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the\r\ngirdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the\r\nleopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and\r\nthe fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and\r\nthe bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the\r\nlion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the\r\nhole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the\r\ncockatrice' den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain:\r\nfor the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters\r\ncover the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThis rod out of the stem of Jesse might be correctly applied to Christ,\r\nfor Joseph was of the descendants of Jesse, the father of David; but as\r\nChrist found existence through the Spirit of God, He called Himself the\r\nSon of God. If He had not done so, this description would refer to Him.\r\nBesides this, the events which he indicated as coming to pass in the days\r\nof that rod, if interpreted symbolically, were in part fulfilled in the\r\nday of Christ, but not all; and if not interpreted, then decidedly none of\r\nthese signs happened. For example, the leopard and the lamb, the lion and\r\nthe calf, the child and the asp, are metaphors and symbols for various\r\nnations, peoples, antagonistic sects and hostile races, who are as\r\nopposite and inimical as the wolf and lamb. We say that by the breath of\r\nthe spirit of Christ they found concord and harmony, they were vivified,\r\nand they associated together.\r\n\r\nBut \"they shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain: for the\r\nearth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the\r\nsea.\" These conditions did not prevail in the time of the manifestation of\r\nChrist; for until today various and antagonistic nations exist in the\r\nworld: very few acknowledge the God of Israel, and the greater number are\r\nwithout the knowledge of God. In the same way, universal peace did not\r\ncome into existence in the time of Christ--that is to say, between the\r\nantagonistic and hostile nations there was neither peace nor concord,\r\ndisputes and disagreements did not cease, and reconciliation and sincerity\r\ndid not appear. So, even at this day, among the Christian sects and\r\nnations themselves, enmity, hatred and the most violent hostility are met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nBut these verses apply word for word to Baha'u'llah. Likewise in this\r\nmarvelous cycle the earth will be transformed, and the world of humanity\r\narrayed in tranquillity and beauty. Disputes, quarrels and murders will be\r\nreplaced by peace, truth and concord; among the nations, peoples, races\r\nand countries, love and amity will appear. Cooperation and union will be\r\nestablished, and finally war will be entirely suppressed. When the laws of\r\nthe Most Holy Book are enforced, contentions and disputes will find a\r\nfinal sentence of absolute justice before a general tribunal of the\r\nnations and kingdoms, and the difficulties that appear will be solved. The\r\nfive continents of the world will form but one, the numerous nations will\r\nbecome one, the surface of the earth will become one land, and mankind\r\nwill be a single community. The relations between the countries--the\r\nmingling, union and friendship of the peoples and communities--will reach\r\nto such a degree that the human race will be like one family and kindred.\r\nThe light of heavenly love will shine, and the darkness of enmity and\r\nhatred will be dispelled from the world. Universal peace will raise its\r\ntent in the center of the earth, and the blessed Tree of Life will grow\r\nand spread to such an extent that it will overshadow the East and the\r\nWest. Strong and weak, rich and poor, antagonistic sects and hostile\r\nnations--which are like the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and kid, the\r\nlion and the calf--will act toward each other with the most complete love,\r\nfriendship, justice and equity. The world will be filled with science,\r\nwith the knowledge of the reality of the mysteries of beings, and with the\r\nknowledge of God.\r\n\r\nNow consider, in this great century which is the cycle of Baha'u'llah,\r\nwhat progress science and knowledge have made, how many secrets of\r\nexistence have been discovered, how many great inventions have been\r\nbrought to light and are day by day multiplying in number. Before long,\r\nmaterial science and learning, as well as the knowledge of God, will make\r\nsuch progress and will show forth such wonders that the beholders will be\r\namazed. Then the mystery of this verse in Isaiah, \"For the earth shall be\r\nfull of the knowledge of the Lord,\" will be completely evident.\r\n\r\nReflect also that in the short time since Baha'u'llah has appeared, people\r\nfrom all countries, nations and races have entered under the shadow of\r\nthis Cause. Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Buddhists, Hindus and Persians\r\nall associate together with the greatest friendship and love, as if indeed\r\nthese people had been related and connected together, they and theirs, for\r\na thousand years; for they are like father and child, mother and daughter,\r\nsister and brother. This is one of the meanings of the companionship of\r\nthe wolf and the lamb, the leopard and the kid, and the lion and the calf.\r\n\r\nOne of the great events which is to occur in the Day of the manifestation\r\nof that Incomparable Branch (Baha'u'llah) is the hoisting of the Standard\r\nof God among all nations. By this is meant that all nations and kindreds\r\nwill be gathered together under the shadow of this Divine Banner, which is\r\nno other than the Lordly Branch itself, and will become a single nation.\r\nReligious and sectarian antagonism, the hostility of races and peoples,\r\nand differences among nations, will be eliminated. All men will adhere to\r\none religion, will have one common faith, will be blended into one race,\r\nand become a single people. All will dwell in one common fatherland, which\r\nis the planet itself. Universal peace and concord will be realized between\r\nall the nations, and that Incomparable Branch will gather together all\r\nIsrael, signifying that in this cycle Israel will be gathered in the Holy\r\nLand, and that the Jewish people who are scattered to the East and West,\r\nSouth and North, will be assembled together.\r\n\r\nNow see: these events did not take place in the Christian cycle, for the\r\nnations did not come under the One Standard which is the Divine Branch.\r\nBut in this cycle of the Lord of Hosts all the nations and peoples will\r\nenter under the shadow of this Flag. In the same way, Israel, scattered\r\nall over the world, was not reassembled in the Holy Land in the Christian\r\ncycle; but in the beginning of the cycle of Baha'u'llah this divine\r\npromise, as is clearly stated in all the Books of the Prophets, has begun\r\nto be manifest. You can see that from all the parts of the world tribes of\r\nJews are coming to the Holy Land; they live in villages and lands which\r\nthey make their own, and day by day they are increasing to such an extent\r\nthat all Palestine will become their home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: COMMENTARY ON THE TWELFTH CHAPTER OF THE REVELATION OF ST. JOHN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have before explained that what is most frequently meant by the Holy\r\nCity, the Jerusalem of God, which is mentioned in the Holy Book, is the\r\nLaw of God. It is compared sometimes to a bride, and sometimes to\r\nJerusalem, and again to the new heaven and earth. So in chapter 21, verses\r\n1, 2 and 3 of the Revelation of St. John, it is said: \"And I saw a new\r\nheaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were\r\npassed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new\r\nJerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned\r\nfor her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold,\r\nthe tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they\r\nshall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nNotice how clear and evident it is that the first heaven and earth signify\r\nthe former Law. For it is said that the first heaven and earth have passed\r\naway and there is no more sea--that is to say, that the earth is the place\r\nof judgment, and on this earth of judgment there is no sea, meaning that\r\nthe teachings and the Law of God will entirely spread over the earth, and\r\nall men will enter the Cause of God, and the earth will be completely\r\ninhabited by believers; therefore, there will be no more sea, for the\r\ndwelling place and abode of man is the dry land. In other words, at that\r\nepoch the field of that Law will become the pleasure-ground of man. Such\r\nearth is solid; the feet do not slip upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Law of God is also described as the Holy City, the New Jerusalem. It\r\nis evident that the New Jerusalem which descends from heaven is not a city\r\nof stone, mortar, bricks, earth and wood. It is the Law of God which\r\ndescends from heaven and is called new, for it is clear that the Jerusalem\r\nwhich is of stone and earth does not descend from heaven, and that it is\r\nnot renewed; but that which is renewed is the Law of God.\r\n\r\nThe Law of God is also compared to an adorned bride who appears with most\r\nbeautiful ornaments, as it has been said in chapter 21 of the Revelation\r\nof St. John: \"And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down\r\nfrom God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\"(73)\r\nAnd in chapter 12, verse 1, it is said: \"And there appeared a great wonder\r\nin heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and\r\nupon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" This woman is that bride, the Law\r\nof God that descended upon Muhammad. The sun with which she was clothed,\r\nand the moon which was under her feet, are the two nations which are under\r\nthe shadow of that Law, the Persian and Ottoman kingdoms; for the emblem\r\nof Persia is the sun, and that of the Ottoman Empire is the crescent moon.\r\nThus the sun and moon are the emblems of two kingdoms which are under the\r\npower of the Law of God. Afterward it is said: \"upon her head is a crown\r\nof twelve stars.\" These twelve stars are the twelve Imams, who were the\r\npromoters of the Law of Muhammad and the educators of the people, shining\r\nlike stars in the heaven of guidance.\r\n\r\nThen it is said in the second verse: \"and she being with child cried,\"\r\nmeaning that this Law fell into the greatest difficulties and endured\r\ngreat troubles and afflictions until a perfect offspring was produced--that\r\nis, the coming Manifestation, the Promised One, Who is the perfect\r\noffspring, and Who was reared in the bosom of this Law, which is as its\r\nmother. The child Who is referred to is the Bab, the Primal Point, Who was\r\nin truth born from the Law of Muhammad--that is to say, the Holy Reality,\r\nWho is the child and outcome of the Law of God, His mother, and Who is\r\npromised by that religion, finds a reality in the kingdom of that Law; but\r\nbecause of the despotism of the dragon the child was carried up to God.\r\nAfter twelve hundred and sixty days the dragon was destroyed, and the\r\nchild of the Law of God, the Promised One, became manifest.\r\n\r\nVerses 3 and 4. \"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; and behold a\r\ngreat red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon\r\nhis heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and\r\ndid cast them to the earth.\"(74) These signs are an allusion to the\r\ndynasty of the Umayyads who dominated the Muhammadan religion. Seven heads\r\nand seven crowns mean seven countries and dominions over which the\r\nUmayyads had power: they were the Roman dominion around Damascus; and the\r\nPersian, Arabian and Egyptian dominions, together with the dominion of\r\nAfrica--that is to say, Tunis, Morocco and Algeria; the dominion of\r\nAndalusia, which is now Spain; and the dominion of the Turks of\r\nTransoxania. The Umayyads had power over these countries. The ten horns\r\nmean the names of the Umayyad rulers--that is, without repetition, there\r\nwere ten names of rulers, meaning ten names of commanders and chiefs--the\r\nfirst is Abu Sufyan and the last Marvan--but several of them bear the same\r\nname. So there are two Muaviya, three Yazid, two Valid, and two Marvan;\r\nbut if the names were counted without repetition there would be ten. The\r\nUmayyads, of whom the first was Abu Sufyan, Amir of Mecca and chief of the\r\ndynasty of the Umayyads, and the last was Marvan, destroyed the third part\r\nof the holy and saintly people of the lineage of Muhammad who were like\r\nthe stars of heaven.\r\n\r\nVerse 4. \"And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be\r\ndelivered, for to devour the child as soon as it was born.\"(75) As we have\r\nbefore explained, this woman is the Law of God. The dragon was standing\r\nnear the woman to devour her child, and this child was the promised\r\nManifestation, the offspring of the Law of Muhammad. The Umayyads were\r\nalways waiting to get possession of the Promised One, Who was to come from\r\nthe line of Muhammad, to destroy and annihilate Him; for they much feared\r\nthe appearance of the promised Manifestation, and they sought to kill any\r\nof Muhammad's descendants who might be highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nVerse 5. \"And she brought forth a man child, Who was to rule all nations\r\nwith a rod of iron.\" This great son is the promised Manifestation Who was\r\nborn of the Law of God and reared in the bosom of the divine teachings.\r\nThe iron rod is a symbol of power and might--it is not a sword--and means\r\nthat with divine power and might He will shepherd all the nations of the\r\nearth. This son is the Bab.\r\n\r\nVerse 5. \"And her child was caught up unto God, and to His throne.\" This\r\nis a prophecy of the Bab, Who ascended to the heavenly realm, to the\r\nThrone of God, and to the center of His Kingdom. Consider how all this\r\ncorresponds to what happened.\r\n\r\nVerse 6. \"And the woman fled into the wilderness\"--that is to say, the Law\r\nof God fled to the wilderness, meaning the vast desert of Hijaz, and the\r\nArabian Peninsula.\r\n\r\nVerse 6. \"Where she had a place prepared of God.\"(76) The Arabian\r\nPeninsula became the abode and dwelling place, and the center of the Law\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nVerse 6. \"That they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and\r\nthreescore days.\" In the terminology of the Holy Book these twelve hundred\r\nand sixty days mean the twelve hundred and sixty years that the Law of God\r\nwas set up in the wilderness of Arabia, the great desert: from it the\r\nPromised One has come. After twelve hundred and sixty years that Law will\r\nhave no more influence, for the fruit of that tree will have appeared, and\r\nthe result will have been produced.\r\n\r\nConsider how the prophecies correspond to one another. In the Apocalypse,\r\nthe appearance of the Promised One is appointed after forty-two months,\r\nand Daniel expresses it as three times and a half, which is also forty-two\r\nmonths, which are twelve hundred and sixty days. In another passage of\r\nJohn's Revelation it is clearly spoken of as twelve hundred and sixty\r\ndays, and in the Holy Book it is said that each day signifies one year.\r\nNothing could be clearer than this agreement of the prophecies with one\r\nanother. The Bab appeared in the year 1260 of the Hejira of Muhammad,\r\nwhich is the beginning of the universal era-reckoning of all Islam. There\r\nare no clearer proofs than this in the Holy Books for any Manifestation.\r\nFor him who is just, the agreement of the times indicated by the tongues\r\nof the Great Ones is the most conclusive proof. There is no other possible\r\nexplanation of these prophecies. Blessed are the just souls who seek the\r\ntruth. But failing justice, the people attack, dispute and openly deny the\r\nevidence, like the Pharisees who, at the manifestation of Christ, denied\r\nwith the greatest obstinacy the explanations of Christ and of His\r\ndisciples. They obscured Christ's Cause before the ignorant people,\r\nsaying, \"These prophecies are not of Jesus, but of the Promised One Who\r\nshall come later, according to the conditions mentioned in the Bible.\"\r\nSome of these conditions were that He must have a kingdom, be seated on\r\nthe throne of David, enforce the Law of the Bible, and manifest such\r\njustice that the wolf and the lamb shall gather at the same spring.\r\n\r\nAnd thus they prevented the people from knowing Christ.\r\n\r\nNote.--In these last conversations 'Abdu'l-Baha wishes to reconcile in a\r\nnew interpretation the apocalyptic prophecies of the Jews, the Christians\r\nand the Muslims, rather than to show their supernatural character. On the\r\npowers of the Prophets, cf. \"The Knowledge of the Divine Manifestations,\"\r\np. 157; and \"Visions and Communication with Spirits,\" p. 251.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14: SPIRITUAL PROOFS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this material world time has cycles; places change through alternating\r\nseasons, and for souls there are progress, retrogression and education.\r\n\r\nAt one time it is the season of spring; at another it is the season of\r\nautumn; and again it is the season of summer or the season of winter.\r\n\r\nIn the spring there are the clouds which send down the precious rain, the\r\nmusk-scented breezes and life-giving zephyrs; the air is perfectly\r\ntemperate, the rain falls, the sun shines, the fecundating wind wafts the\r\nclouds, the world is renewed, and the breath of life appears in plants, in\r\nanimals and in men. Earthly beings pass from one condition to another. All\r\nthings are clothed in new garments, and the black earth is covered with\r\nherbage; mountains and plains are adorned with verdure; trees bear leaves\r\nand blossoms; gardens bring forth flowers and fragrant herbs. The world\r\nbecomes another world, and it attains to a life-giving spirit. The earth\r\nwas a lifeless body; it finds a new spirit, and produces endless beauty,\r\ngrace and freshness. Thus the spring is the cause of new life and infuses\r\na new spirit.\r\n\r\nAfterward comes the summer, when the heat increases, and growth and\r\ndevelopment attain their greatest power. The energy of life in the\r\nvegetable kingdom reaches to the degree of perfection, the fruit appears,\r\nand the time of harvest ripens; a seed has become a sheaf, and the food is\r\nstored for winter. Afterward comes tumultuous autumn when unwholesome and\r\nsterile winds blow; it is the season of sickness, when all things are\r\nwithered, and the balmy air is vitiated. The breezes of spring are changed\r\nto autumn winds; the fertile green trees have become withered and bare;\r\nflowers and fragrant herbs fade away; the beautiful garden becomes a\r\ndustheap. Following this comes the season of winter, with cold and\r\ntempests. It snows, rains, hails, storms, thunders and lightens, freezes\r\nand congeals; all plants die, and animals languish and are wretched.\r\n\r\nWhen this state is reached, again a new life-giving spring returns, and\r\nthe cycle is renewed. The season of spring with its hosts of freshness and\r\nbeauty spreads its tent on the plains and mountains with great pomp and\r\nmagnificence. A second time the form of the creatures is renewed, and the\r\ncreation of beings begins afresh; bodies grow and develop, the plains and\r\nwildernesses become green and fertile, trees bring forth blossoms, and the\r\nspring of last year returns in the utmost fullness and glory. Such is, and\r\nsuch ought to be, the cycle and succession of existence. Such is the cycle\r\nand revolution of the material world.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with the spiritual cycles of the Prophets--that is to say,\r\nthe day of the appearance of the Holy Manifestations is the spiritual\r\nspringtime; it is the divine splendor; it is the heavenly bounty, the\r\nbreeze of life, the rising of the Sun of Reality. Spirits are quickened;\r\nhearts are refreshed and invigorated; souls become good; existence is set\r\nin motion; human realities are gladdened, and grow and develop in good\r\nqualities and perfections. General progress is achieved and revival takes\r\nplace, for it is the day of resurrection, the time of excitement and\r\nferment, and the season of bliss, of joy and of intense rapture.\r\n\r\nAfterward the life-giving spring ends in fruitful summer. The word of God\r\nis exalted, the Law of God is promulgated; all things reach perfection.\r\nThe heavenly table is spread, the holy breezes perfume the East and the\r\nWest, the teachings of God conquer the world, men become educated,\r\npraiseworthy results are produced, universal progress appears in the world\r\nof humanity, and the divine bounties surround all things. The Sun of\r\nReality rises from the horizon of the Kingdom with the greatest power and\r\nheat. When it reaches the meridian, it will begin to decline and descend,\r\nand the spiritual summer will be followed by autumn, when growth and\r\ndevelopment are arrested. Breezes change into blighting winds, and the\r\nunwholesome season dissipates the beauty and freshness of the gardens,\r\nplains and bowers--that is to say, attraction and goodwill do not remain,\r\ndivine qualities are changed, the radiance of hearts is dimmed, the\r\nspirituality of souls is altered, virtues are replaced by vices, and\r\nholiness and purity disappear. Only the name of the Religion of God\r\nremains, and the exoteric forms of the divine teachings. The foundations\r\nof the Religion of God are destroyed and annihilated, and nothing but\r\nforms and customs exist. Divisions appear, firmness is changed into\r\ninstability, and spirits become dead; hearts languish, souls become inert,\r\nand winter arrives--that is to say, the coldness of ignorance envelops the\r\nworld, and the darkness of human error prevails. After this come\r\nindifference, disobedience, inconsiderateness, indolence, baseness, animal\r\ninstincts and the coldness and insensibility of stones. It is like the\r\nseason of winter when the terrestrial globe, deprived of the effect of the\r\nheat of the sun, becomes desolate and dreary. When the world of\r\nintelligence and thought has reached to this state, there remain only\r\ncontinual death and perpetual nonexistence.\r\n\r\nWhen the season of winter has had its effect, again the spiritual\r\nspringtime returns, and a new cycle appears. Spiritual breezes blow, the\r\nluminous dawn gleams, the divine clouds give rain, the rays of the Sun of\r\nReality shine forth, the contingent world attains unto a new life and is\r\nclad in a wonderful garment. All the signs and the gifts of the past\r\nspringtime reappear, with perhaps even greater splendor in this new\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual cycles of the Sun of Reality are like the cycles of the\r\nmaterial sun: they are always revolving and being renewed. The Sun of\r\nReality, like the material sun, has numerous rising and dawning places:\r\none day it rises from the zodiacal sign of Cancer, another day from the\r\nsign of Libra or Aquarius; another time it is from the sign of Aries that\r\nit diffuses its rays. But the sun is one sun and one reality; the people\r\nof knowledge are lovers of the sun, and are not fascinated by the places\r\nof its rising and dawning. The people of perception are the seekers of the\r\ntruth, and not of the places of its appearance, nor of its dawning points;\r\ntherefore, they will adore the Sun from whatever point in the zodiac it\r\nmay appear, and they will seek the Reality in every Sanctified Soul Who\r\nmanifests it. Such people always attain to the truth and are not veiled\r\nfrom the Sun of the Divine World. So the lover of the sun and the seeker\r\nof the light will always turn toward the sun, whether it shines from the\r\nsign of Aries or gives its bounty from the sign of Cancer, or radiates\r\nfrom Gemini; but the ignorant and uninstructed are lovers of the signs of\r\nthe zodiac, and enamored and fascinated by the rising-places, and not by\r\nthe sun. When it was in the sign of Cancer, they turned toward it, though\r\nafterward the sun changed to the sign of Libra; as they were lovers of the\r\nsign, they turned toward it and attached themselves to it, and were\r\ndeprived of the influences of the sun merely because it had changed its\r\nplace. For example, once the Sun of Reality poured forth its rays from the\r\nsign of Abraham, and then it dawned from the sign of Moses and illuminated\r\nthe horizon. Afterward it rose with the greatest power and brilliancy from\r\nthe sign of Christ. Those who were the seekers of Reality worshiped that\r\nReality wherever they saw it, but those who were attached to Abraham were\r\ndeprived of its influences when it shone upon Sinai and illuminated the\r\nreality of Moses. Those who held fast to Moses, when the Sun of Reality\r\nshone from Christ with the utmost radiance and lordly splendor, were also\r\nveiled; and so forth.\r\n\r\nTherefore, man must be the seeker after the Reality, and he will find that\r\nReality in each of the Sanctified Souls. He must be fascinated and\r\nenraptured, and attracted to the divine bounty; he must be like the\r\nbutterfly who is the lover of the light from whatever lamp it may shine,\r\nand like the nightingale who is the lover of the rose in whatever garden\r\nit may grow.\r\n\r\nIf the sun were to rise in the West, it would still be the sun; one must\r\nnot withdraw from it on account of its rising-place, nor consider the West\r\nto be always the place of sunset. In the same way, one must look for the\r\nheavenly bounties and seek for the Divine Aurora. In every place where it\r\nappears, one must become its distracted lover. Consider that if the Jews\r\nhad not kept turning to the horizon of Moses, and had only regarded the\r\nSun of Reality, without any doubt they would have recognized the Sun in\r\nthe dawning-place of the reality of Christ, in the greatest divine\r\nsplendor. But, alas! a thousand times alas! attaching themselves to the\r\noutward words of Moses, they were deprived of the divine bounties and the\r\nlordly splendors!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15: TRUE WEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe honor and exaltation of every existing being depends upon causes and\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe excellency, the adornment and the perfection of the earth is to be\r\nverdant and fertile through the bounty of the clouds of springtime. Plants\r\ngrow; flowers and fragrant herbs spring up; fruit-bearing trees become\r\nfull of blossoms and bring forth fresh and new fruit. Gardens become\r\nbeautiful, and meadows adorned; mountains and plains are clad in a green\r\nrobe, and gardens, fields, villages and cities are decorated. This is the\r\nprosperity of the mineral world.\r\n\r\nThe height of exaltation and the perfection of the vegetable world is that\r\na tree should grow on the bank of a stream of fresh water, that a gentle\r\nbreeze should blow on it, that the warmth of the sun should shine on it,\r\nthat a gardener should attend to its cultivation, and that day by day it\r\nshould develop and yield fruit. But its real prosperity is to progress\r\ninto the animal and human world, and replace that which has been exhausted\r\nin the bodies of animals and men.\r\n\r\nThe exaltation of the animal world is to possess perfect members, organs\r\nand powers, and to have all its needs supplied. This is its chief glory,\r\nits honor and exaltation. So the supreme happiness of an animal is to have\r\npossession of a green and fertile meadow, perfectly pure flowing water,\r\nand a lovely, verdant forest. If these things are provided for it, no\r\ngreater prosperity can be imagined. For example, if a bird builds its nest\r\nin a green and fruitful forest, in a beautiful high place, upon a strong\r\ntree, and at the top of a lofty branch, and if it finds all it needs of\r\nseeds and water, this is its perfect prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut real prosperity for the animal consists in passing from the animal\r\nworld to the human world, like the microscopic beings that, through the\r\nwater and air, enter into man and are assimilated, and replace that which\r\nhas been consumed in his body. This is the great honor and prosperity for\r\nthe animal world; no greater honor can be conceived for it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is evident and clear that this wealth, this comfort and this\r\nmaterial abundance form the complete prosperity of minerals, vegetables\r\nand animals. No riches, wealth, comfort or ease of the material world is\r\nequal to the wealth of a bird; all the areas of these plains and mountains\r\nare its dwelling, and all the seeds and harvests are its food and wealth,\r\nand all the lands, villages, meadows, pastures, forests and wildernesses\r\nare its possessions. Now, which is the richer, this bird, or the most\r\nwealthy man? for no matter how many seeds it may take or bestow, its\r\nwealth does not decrease.\r\n\r\nThen it is clear that the honor and exaltation of man must be something\r\nmore than material riches. Material comforts are only a branch, but the\r\nroot of the exaltation of man is the good attributes and virtues which are\r\nthe adornments of his reality. These are the divine appearances, the\r\nheavenly bounties, the sublime emotions, the love and knowledge of God;\r\nuniversal wisdom, intellectual perception, scientific discoveries,\r\njustice, equity, truthfulness, benevolence, natural courage and innate\r\nfortitude; the respect for rights and the keeping of agreements and\r\ncovenants; rectitude in all circumstances; serving the truth under all\r\nconditions; the sacrifice of one's life for the good of all people;\r\nkindness and esteem for all nations; obedience to the teachings of God;\r\nservice in the Divine Kingdom; the guidance of the people, and the\r\neducation of the nations and races. This is the prosperity of the human\r\nworld! This is the exaltation of man in the world! This is eternal life\r\nand heavenly honor!\r\n\r\nThese virtues do not appear from the reality of man except through the\r\npower of God and the divine teachings, for they need supernatural power\r\nfor their manifestation. It may be that in the world of nature a trace of\r\nthese perfections may appear, but they are unstable and ephemeral; they\r\nare like the rays of the sun upon the wall.\r\n\r\nAs the compassionate God has placed such a wonderful crown upon the head\r\nof man, man should strive that its brilliant jewels may become visible in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO: SOME CHRISTIAN SUBJECTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16: OUTWARD FORMS AND SYMBOLS MUST BE USED TO CONVEY INTELLECTUAL\r\nCONCEPTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA subject that is essential(77) for the comprehension of the questions\r\nthat we have mentioned, and of others of which we are about to speak, so\r\nthat the essence of the problems may be understood, is this: that human\r\nknowledge is of two kinds. One is the knowledge of things perceptible to\r\nthe senses--that is to say, things which the eye, or ear, or smell, or\r\ntaste, or touch can perceive, which are called objective or sensible. So\r\nthe sun, because it can be seen, is said to be objective; and in the same\r\nway sounds are sensible because the ear hears them; perfumes are sensible\r\nbecause they can be inhaled and the sense of smell perceives them; foods\r\nare sensible because the palate perceives their sweetness, sourness or\r\nsaltness; heat and cold are sensible because the feelings perceive them.\r\nThese are said to be sensible realities.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of human knowledge is intellectual--that is to say, it is a\r\nreality of the intellect; it has no outward form and no place and is not\r\nperceptible to the senses. For example, the power of intellect is not\r\nsensible; none of the inner qualities of man is a sensible thing; on the\r\ncontrary, they are intellectual realities. So love is a mental reality and\r\nnot sensible; for this reality the ear does not hear, the eye does not\r\nsee, the smell does not perceive, the taste does not discern, the touch\r\ndoes not feel. Even ethereal matter, the forces of which are said in\r\nphysics to be heat, light, electricity and magnetism, is an intellectual\r\nreality, and is not sensible. In the same way, nature, also, in its\r\nessence is an intellectual reality and is not sensible; the human spirit\r\nis an intellectual, not sensible reality. In explaining these intellectual\r\nrealities, one is obliged to express them by sensible figures because in\r\nexterior existence there is nothing that is not material. Therefore, to\r\nexplain the reality of the spirit--its condition, its station--one is\r\nobliged to give explanations under the forms of sensible things because in\r\nthe external world all that exists is sensible. For example, grief and\r\nhappiness are intellectual things; when you wish to express those\r\nspiritual qualities you say: \"My heart is oppressed; my heart is dilated,\"\r\nthough the heart of man is neither oppressed nor dilated. This is an\r\nintellectual or spiritual state, to explain which you are obliged to have\r\nrecourse to sensible figures. Another example: you say, \"such an\r\nindividual made great progress,\" though he is remaining in the same place;\r\nor again, \"such a one's position was exalted,\" although, like everyone\r\nelse, he walks upon the earth. This exaltation and this progress are\r\nspiritual states and intellectual realities, but to explain them you are\r\nobliged to have recourse to sensible figures because in the exterior world\r\nthere is nothing that is not sensible.\r\n\r\nSo the symbol of knowledge is light, and of ignorance, darkness; but\r\nreflect, is knowledge sensible light, or ignorance sensible darkness? No,\r\nthey are merely symbols. These are only intellectual states, but when you\r\ndesire to express them outwardly, you call knowledge light, and ignorance\r\ndarkness. You say: \"My heart was gloomy, and it became enlightened.\" Now,\r\nthat light of knowledge, and that darkness of ignorance, are intellectual\r\nrealities, not sensible ones; but when we seek for explanations in the\r\nexternal world, we are obliged to give them a sensible form.\r\n\r\nThen it is evident that the dove which descended upon Christ was not a\r\nmaterial dove, but it was a spiritual state, which, that it might be\r\ncomprehensible, was expressed by a sensible figure. Thus in the Old\r\nTestament it is said that God appeared as a pillar of fire: this does not\r\nsignify the material form; it is an intellectual reality which is\r\nexpressed by a sensible image.\r\n\r\nChrist says, \"The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father.\" Was\r\nChrist within God, or God within Christ? No, in the name of God! On the\r\ncontrary, this is an intellectual state which is expressed in a sensible\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nWe come to the explanation of the words of Baha'u'llah when He says: \"O\r\nking! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the\r\nbreezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the\r\nknowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One\r\nWho is Almighty and All-Knowing.\"(78) This is the state of manifestation:\r\nit is not sensible; it is an intellectual reality, exempt and freed from\r\ntime, from past, present and future; it is an explanation, a simile, a\r\nmetaphor and is not to be accepted literally; it is not a state that can\r\nbe comprehended by man. Sleeping and waking is passing from one state to\r\nanother. Sleeping is the condition of repose, and wakefulness is the\r\ncondition of movement. Sleeping is the state of silence; wakefulness is\r\nthe state of speech. Sleeping is the state of mystery; wakefulness is the\r\nstate of manifestation.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is a Persian and Arabic expression to say that the earth\r\nwas asleep, and the spring came, and it awoke; or the earth was dead, and\r\nthe spring came, and it revived. These expressions are metaphors,\r\nallegories, mystic explanations in the world of signification.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the Holy Manifestations have ever been, and ever will be,\r\nLuminous Realities; no change or variation takes place in Their essence.\r\nBefore declaring Their manifestation, They are silent and quiet like a\r\nsleeper, and after Their manifestation, They speak and are illuminated,\r\nlike one who is awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17: THE BIRTH OF CHRIST\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--How was Christ born of the Holy Spirit?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--In regard to this question, theologians and materialists disagree.\r\nThe theologians believe that Christ was born of the Holy Spirit, but the\r\nmaterialists think this is impossible and inadmissible, and that without\r\ndoubt He had a human father.\r\n\r\nIn the Qur'an it is said: \"And We sent Our Spirit unto her, and He\r\nappeared unto her in the shape of a perfect man,\"(79) meaning that the\r\nHoly Spirit took the likeness of the human form, as an image is produced\r\nin a mirror, and he addressed Mary.\r\n\r\nThe materialists believe that there must be marriage, and say that a\r\nliving body cannot be created from a lifeless body, and without male and\r\nfemale there cannot be fecundation. And they think that not only with man,\r\nbut also with animals and plants, it is impossible. For this union of the\r\nmale and female exists in all living beings and plants. This pairing of\r\nthings is even shown forth in the Qur'an: \"Glory be to Him Who has created\r\nall the pairs: of such things as the earth produceth, and of themselves;\r\nand of things which they know not\"(80)--that is to say, men, animals and\r\nplants are all in pairs--\"and of everything have We created two kinds\"--that\r\nis to say, We have created all the beings through pairing.\r\n\r\nBriefly, they say a man without a human father cannot be imagined. In\r\nanswer, the theologians say: \"This thing is not impossible and\r\nunachievable, but it has not been seen; and there is a great difference\r\nbetween a thing which is impossible and one which is unknown. For example,\r\nin former times the telegraph, which causes the East and the West to\r\ncommunicate, was unknown but not impossible; photography and phonography\r\nwere unknown but not impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe materialists insist upon this belief, and the theologians reply: \"Is\r\nthis globe eternal or phenomenal?\" The materialists answer that, according\r\nto science and important discoveries, it is established that it is\r\nphenomenal; in the beginning it was a flaming globe, and gradually it\r\nbecame temperate; a crust was formed around it, and upon this crust plants\r\ncame into existence, then animals, and finally man.\r\n\r\nThe theologians say: \"Then from your statement it has become evident and\r\nclear that mankind is phenomenal upon the globe, and not eternal. Then\r\nsurely the first man had neither father nor mother, for the existence of\r\nman is phenomenal. Is not the creation of man without father and mother,\r\neven though gradually, more difficult than if he had simply come into\r\nexistence without a father? As you admit that the first man came into\r\nexistence without father or mother--whether it be gradually or at\r\nonce--there can remain no doubt that a man without a human father is also\r\npossible and admissible; you cannot consider this impossible; otherwise,\r\nyou are illogical. For example, if you say that this lamp has once been\r\nlighted without wick and oil, and then say that it is impossible to light\r\nit without the wick, this is illogical.\" Christ had a mother; the first\r\nman, as the materialists believe, had neither father nor mother.(81)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18: THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS DUE TO HIS PERFECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA great man is a great man, whether born of a human father or not. If\r\nbeing without a father is a virtue, Adam is greater and more excellent\r\nthan all the Prophets and Messengers, for He had neither father nor\r\nmother. That which causes honor and greatness is the splendor and bounty\r\nof the divine perfections. The sun is born from substance and form, which\r\ncan be compared to father and mother, and it is absolute perfection; but\r\nthe darkness has neither substance nor form, neither father nor mother,\r\nand it is absolute imperfection. The substance of Adam's physical life was\r\nearth, but the substance of Abraham was pure sperm; it is certain that the\r\npure and chaste sperm is superior to earth.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the first chapter of the Gospel of John, verses 12 and 13,\r\nit is said: \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become\r\nthe sons of God, even to them that believed on His name:\r\n\r\n\"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the\r\nwill of man, but of God.\"(82)\r\n\r\nFrom these verses it is obvious that the being of a disciple also is not\r\ncreated by physical power, but by the spiritual reality. The honor and\r\ngreatness of Christ is not due to the fact that He did not have a human\r\nfather, but to His perfections, bounties and divine glory. If the\r\ngreatness of Christ is His being fatherless, then Adam is greater than\r\nChrist, for He had neither father nor mother. It is said in the Old\r\nTestament, \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and\r\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living\r\nsoul.\"(83) Observe that it is said that Adam came into existence from the\r\nSpirit of life. Moreover, the expression which John uses in regard to the\r\ndisciples proves that they also are from the Heavenly Father. Hence it is\r\nevident that the holy reality, meaning the real existence of every great\r\nman, comes from God and owes its being to the breath of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe purport is that, if to be without a father is the greatest human\r\nglory, then Adam is greater than all, for He had neither father nor\r\nmother. Is it better for a man to be created from a living substance or\r\nfrom earth? Certainly it is better if he be created from a living\r\nsubstance. But Christ was born and came into existence from the Holy\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: the splendor and honor of the holy souls and the Divine\r\nManifestations come from Their heavenly perfections, bounties and glory,\r\nand from nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19: THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--It is said in the Gospel of St. Matthew, chapter 3, verses 13,\r\n14, 15: \"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be\r\nbaptized of him. But John forbade Him, saying, I have need to be baptized\r\nof Thee, and comest Thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer\r\nit to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then\r\nhe suffered Him.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the wisdom of this: since Christ possessed all essential\r\nperfection, why did He need baptism?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The principle of baptism is purification by repentance. John\r\nadmonished and exhorted the people, and caused them to repent; then he\r\nbaptized them. Therefore, it is apparent that this baptism is a symbol of\r\nrepentance from all sin: its meaning is expressed in these words: \"O God!\r\nas my body has become purified and cleansed from physical impurities, in\r\nthe same way purify and sanctify my spirit from the impurities of the\r\nworld of nature, which are not worthy of the Threshold of Thy Unity!\"\r\nRepentance is the return from disobedience to obedience. Man, after\r\nremoteness and deprivation from God, repents and undergoes purification:\r\nand this is a symbol signifying \"O God! make my heart good and pure, freed\r\nand sanctified from all save Thy love.\"\r\n\r\nAs Christ desired that this institution of John should be used at that\r\ntime by all, He Himself conformed to it in order to awaken the people and\r\nto complete the law of the former religion. Although the ablution of\r\nrepentance was the institution of John, it was in reality formerly\r\npracticed in the religion of God.\r\n\r\nChrist was not in need of baptism; but as at that time it was an\r\nacceptable and praiseworthy action, and a sign of the glad tidings of the\r\nKingdom, therefore, He confirmed it. However, afterward He said the true\r\nbaptism is not with material water, but it must be with spirit and with\r\nwater. In this case water does not signify material water, for elsewhere\r\nit is explicitly said baptism is with spirit and with fire, from which it\r\nis clear that the reference is not to material fire and material water,\r\nfor baptism with fire is impossible.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the spirit is the bounty of God, the water is knowledge and\r\nlife, and the fire is the love of God. For material water does not purify\r\nthe heart of man; no, it cleanses his body. But the heavenly water and\r\nspirit, which are knowledge and life, make the human heart good and pure;\r\nthe heart which receives a portion of the bounty of the Spirit becomes\r\nsanctified, good and pure--that is to say, the reality of man becomes\r\npurified and sanctified from the impurities of the world of nature. These\r\nnatural impurities are evil qualities: anger, lust, worldliness, pride,\r\nlying, hypocrisy, fraud, self-love, etc.\r\n\r\nMan cannot free himself from the rage of the carnal passions except by the\r\nhelp of the Holy Spirit. That is why He says baptism with the spirit, with\r\nwater and with fire is necessary, and that it is essential--that is to say,\r\nthe spirit of divine bounty, the water of knowledge and life, and the fire\r\nof the love of God. Man must be baptized with this spirit, this water and\r\nthis fire so as to become filled with the eternal bounty. Otherwise, what\r\nis the use of baptizing with material water? No, this baptism with water\r\nwas a symbol of repentance, and of seeking forgiveness of sins.\r\n\r\nBut in the cycle of Baha'u'llah there is no longer need of this symbol;\r\nfor its reality, which is to be baptized with the spirit and love of God,\r\nis understood and established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20: THE NECESSITY OF BAPTISM\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Is the ablution of baptism useful and necessary, or is it\r\nuseless and unnecessary? In the first case, if it is useful, why was it\r\nabrogated? And in the second case, if it is useless, why did John practice\r\nit?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The change in conditions, alterations and transformations are\r\nnecessities of the essence of beings, and essential necessities cannot be\r\nseparated from the reality of things. So it is absolutely impossible to\r\nseparate heat from fire, humidity from water, or light from the sun, for\r\nthey are essential necessities. As the change and alteration of conditions\r\nare necessities for beings, so laws also are changed and altered in\r\naccordance with the changes and alterations of the times. For example, in\r\nthe time of Moses, His Law was conformed and adapted to the conditions of\r\nthe time; but in the days of Christ these conditions had changed and\r\naltered to such an extent that the Mosaic Law was no longer suited and\r\nadapted to the needs of mankind; and it was, therefore, abrogated. Thus it\r\nwas that Christ broke the Sabbath and forbade divorce. After Christ four\r\ndisciples, among whom were Peter and Paul, permitted the use of animal\r\nfood forbidden by the Bible, except the eating of those animals which had\r\nbeen strangled, or which were sacrificed to idols, and of blood.(84) They\r\nalso forbade fornication. They maintained these four commandments.\r\nAfterward, Paul permitted even the eating of strangled animals, those\r\nsacrificed to idols, and blood, and only maintained the prohibition of\r\nfornication. So in chapter 14, verse 14 of his Epistle to the Romans, Paul\r\nwrites: \"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing\r\nunclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to\r\nhim it is unclean.\"\r\n\r\nAlso in the Epistle of Paul to Titus, chapter 1, verse 15: \"Unto the pure\r\nall things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is\r\nnothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.\"\r\n\r\nNow this change, these alterations and this abrogation are due to the\r\nimpossibility of comparing the time of Christ with that of Moses. The\r\nconditions and requirements in the later period were entirely changed and\r\naltered. The former laws were, therefore, abrogated.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the world may be compared to that of a man, and the\r\nProphets and Messengers of God to skillful doctors. The human being cannot\r\nremain in one condition: different maladies occur which have each a\r\nspecial remedy. The skillful physician does not give the same medicine to\r\ncure each disease and each malady, but he changes remedies and medicines\r\naccording to the different necessities of the diseases and constitutions.\r\nOne person may have a severe illness caused by fever, and the skilled\r\ndoctor will give him cooling remedies; and when at some other time the\r\ncondition of this person has changed, and fever is replaced by chills,\r\nwithout doubt the skilled doctor will discard cooling medicine and permit\r\nthe use of heating drugs. This change and alteration is required by the\r\ncondition of the patient and is an evident proof of the skill of the\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nConsider, could the Law of the Old Testament be enforced at this epoch and\r\ntime? No, in the name of God! it would be impossible and impracticable;\r\ntherefore, most certainly God abrogated the laws of the Old Testament at\r\nthe time of Christ. Reflect, also, that baptism in the days of John the\r\nBaptist was used to awaken and admonish the people to repent from all sin,\r\nand to watch for the appearance of the Kingdom of Christ. But at present\r\nin Asia, the Catholics and the Orthodox Church plunge newly born children\r\ninto water mixed with olive oil, and many of them become ill from the\r\nshock; at the time of baptism they struggle and become agitated. In other\r\nplaces, the clergy sprinkle the water of baptism on the forehead. But\r\nneither from the first form nor from the second do the children derive any\r\nspiritual benefit. Then what result is obtained from this form? Other\r\npeoples are amazed and wonder why the infant is plunged into the water,\r\nsince this is neither the cause of the spiritual awakening of the child,\r\nnor of its faith or conversion, but it is only a custom which is followed.\r\nIn the time of John the Baptist it was not so; no, at first John used to\r\nexhort the people, and to guide them to repentance from sin, and to fill\r\nthem with the desire to await the manifestation of Christ. Whoever\r\nreceived the ablution of baptism, and repented of sins in absolute\r\nhumility and meekness, would also purify and cleanse his body from outward\r\nimpurities. With perfect yearning, night and day, he would constantly wait\r\nfor the manifestation of Christ, and the entrance to the Kingdom of the\r\nSpirit of God.(85)\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: our meaning is that the change and modification of\r\nconditions, and the altered requirements of different centuries and times,\r\nare the cause of the abrogation of laws. For a time comes when these laws\r\nare no longer suitably adapted to conditions. Consider how very different\r\nare the requirements of the first centuries, of the Middle Ages, and of\r\nmodern times. Is it possible that the laws of the first centuries could be\r\nenforced at present? It is evident that it would be impossible and\r\nimpracticable. In the same manner, after the lapse of a few centuries, the\r\nrequirements of the present time will not be the same as those of the\r\nfuture, and certainly there will be change and alteration. In Europe the\r\nlaws are unceasingly altered and modified; in bygone years, how many laws\r\nexisted in the organizations and systems of Europe, which are now\r\nabrogated! These changes and alterations are due to the variation and\r\nmutation of thought, conditions and customs. If it were not so, the\r\nprosperity of the world of humanity would be wrecked.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is in the Pentateuch a law that if anyone break the\r\nSabbath, he shall be put to death. Moreover, there are ten sentences of\r\ndeath in the Pentateuch. Would it be possible to keep these laws in our\r\ntime? It is clear that it would be absolutely impossible. Consequently,\r\nthere are changes and modifications in the laws, and these are a\r\nsufficient proof of the supreme wisdom of God.\r\n\r\nThis subject needs deep thought. Then the cause of these changes will be\r\nevident and apparent.\r\n\r\nBlessed are those who reflect!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21: THE SYMBOLISM OF THE BREAD AND THE WINE\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--The Christ said: \"I am the living bread which came down from\r\nheaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die.\"(86) What is the meaning\r\nof this utterance?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--This bread signifies the heavenly food and divine perfections. So,\r\n\"If any man eateth of this bread\" means if any man acquires heavenly\r\nbounty, receives the divine light, or partakes of Christ's perfections, he\r\nthereby gains everlasting life. The blood also signifies the spirit of\r\nlife and the divine perfections, the lordly splendor and eternal bounty.\r\nFor all the members of the body gain vital substance from the circulation\r\nof the blood.\r\n\r\nIn the Gospel of St. John, chapter 6, verse 26, it is written: \"Ye seek\r\nMe, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves,\r\nand were filled.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the bread of which the disciples ate and were filled\r\nwas the heavenly bounty; for in verse 33 of the same chapter it is said:\r\n\"For the bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life\r\nunto the world.\" It is clear that the body of Christ did not descend from\r\nheaven, but it came from the womb of Mary; and that which descended from\r\nthe heaven of God was the spirit of Christ. As the Jews thought that\r\nChrist spoke of His body, they made objections, for it is said in the 42nd\r\nverse of the same chapter: \"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of\r\nJoseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I\r\ncame down from heaven?\"\r\n\r\nReflect how clear it is that what Christ meant by the heavenly bread was\r\nHis spirit, His bounties, His perfections and His teachings; for it is\r\nsaid in the 63rd verse: \"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh\r\nprofiteth nothing.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is evident that the spirit of Christ is a heavenly grace\r\nwhich descends from heaven; whosoever receives light from that spirit in\r\nabundance--that is to say, the heavenly teachings--finds everlasting life.\r\nThat is why it is said in the 35th verse: \"And Jesus said unto them, I am\r\nthe bread of life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that\r\nbelieveth on Me shall never thirst.\"\r\n\r\nNotice that \"coming to Him\" He expresses as eating, and \"belief in Him\" as\r\ndrinking. Then it is evident and established that the celestial food is\r\nthe divine bounties, the spiritual splendors, the heavenly teachings, the\r\nuniversal meaning of Christ. To eat is to draw near to Him, and to drink\r\nis to believe in Him. For Christ had an elemental body and a celestial\r\nform. The elemental body was crucified, but the heavenly form is living\r\nand eternal, and the cause of everlasting life; the first was the human\r\nnature, and the second is the divine nature. It is thought by some that\r\nthe Eucharist is the reality of Christ, and that the Divinity and the Holy\r\nSpirit descend into and exist in it. Now when once the Eucharist is taken,\r\nafter a few moments it is simply disintegrated and entirely transformed.\r\nTherefore, how can such a thought be conceived? God forbid! certainly it\r\nis an absolute fantasy.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: through the manifestation of Christ, the divine teachings,\r\nwhich are an eternal bounty, were spread abroad, the light of guidance\r\nshone forth, and the spirit of life was conferred on man. Whoever found\r\nguidance became living; whoever remained lost was seized by enduring\r\ndeath. This bread which came down from heaven was the divine body of\r\nChrist, His spiritual elements, which the disciples ate, and through which\r\nthey gained eternal life.\r\n\r\nThe disciples had taken many meals from the hand of Christ; why was the\r\nlast supper distinguished from the others? It is evident that the heavenly\r\nbread did not signify this material bread, but rather the divine\r\nnourishment of the spiritual body of Christ, the divine graces and\r\nheavenly perfections of which His disciples partook, and with which they\r\nbecame filled.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, reflect that when Christ blessed the bread and gave it to\r\nHis disciples, saying, \"This is My body,\"(87) and gave grace to them, He\r\nwas with them in person, in presence, and form. He was not transformed\r\ninto bread and wine; if He had been turned into bread and wine, He could\r\nnot have remained with the disciples in body, in person and in presence.\r\n\r\nThen it is clear that the bread and wine were symbols which signified: I\r\nhave given you My bounties and perfections, and when you have received\r\nthis bounty, you have gained eternal life and have partaken of your share\r\nand your portion of the heavenly nourishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22: MIRACLES\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--It is recorded that miracles were performed by Christ. Are the\r\nreports of these miracles really to be accepted literally, or have they\r\nanother meaning? It has been proved by exact science that the essence of\r\nthings does not change, and that all beings are under one universal law\r\nand organization from which they cannot deviate; and, therefore, that\r\nwhich is contrary to universal law is impossible.\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The Holy Manifestations are the sources of miracles and the\r\noriginators of wonderful signs. For Them, any difficult and impracticable\r\nthing is possible and easy. For through a supernatural power wonders\r\nappear from Them; and by this power, which is beyond nature, They\r\ninfluence the world of nature. From all the Manifestations marvelous\r\nthings have appeared.\r\n\r\nBut in the Holy Books an especial terminology is employed, and for the\r\nManifestations these miracles and wonderful signs have no importance. They\r\ndo not even wish to mention them. For if we consider miracles a great\r\nproof, they are still only proofs and arguments for those who are present\r\nwhen they are performed, and not for those who are absent.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we relate to a seeker, a stranger to Moses and Christ,\r\nmarvelous signs, he will deny them and will say: \"Wonderful signs are also\r\ncontinually related of false gods by the testimony of many people, and\r\nthey are affirmed in the Books. The Brahmans have written a book about\r\nwonderful prodigies from Brahma.\" He will also say: \"How can we know that\r\nthe Jews and the Christians speak the truth, and that the Brahmans tell a\r\nlie? For both are generally admitted traditions, which are collected in\r\nbooks, and may be supposed to be true or false.\" The same may be said of\r\nother religions: if one is true, all are true; if one is accepted, all\r\nmust be accepted. Therefore, miracles are not a proof. For if they are\r\nproofs for those who are present, they fail as proofs to those who are\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nBut in the day of the Manifestation the people with insight see that all\r\nthe conditions of the Manifestation are miracles, for They are superior to\r\nall others, and this alone is an absolute miracle. Recollect that Christ,\r\nsolitary and alone, without a helper or protector, without armies and\r\nlegions, and under the greatest oppression, uplifted the standard of God\r\nbefore all the people of the world, and withstood them, and finally\r\nconquered all, although outwardly He was crucified. Now this is a\r\nveritable miracle which can never be denied. There is no need of any other\r\nproof of the truth of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe outward miracles have no importance for the people of Reality. If a\r\nblind man receives sight, for example, he will finally again become\r\nsightless, for he will die and be deprived of all his senses and powers.\r\nTherefore, causing the blind man to see is comparatively of little\r\nimportance, for this faculty of sight will at last disappear. If the body\r\nof a dead person be resuscitated, of what use is it since the body will\r\ndie again? But it is important to give perception and eternal life--that\r\nis, the spiritual and divine life. For this physical life is not immortal,\r\nand its existence is equivalent to nonexistence. So it is that Christ said\r\nto one of His disciples: \"Let the dead bury their dead;\" for \"That which\r\nis born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is\r\nspirit.\"(88)\r\n\r\nObserve: those who in appearance were physically alive, Christ considered\r\ndead; for life is the eternal life, and existence is the real existence.\r\nWherever in the Holy Books they speak of raising the dead, the meaning is\r\nthat the dead were blessed by eternal life; where it is said that the\r\nblind received sight, the signification is that he obtained the true\r\nperception; where it is said a deaf man received hearing, the meaning is\r\nthat he acquired spiritual and heavenly hearing. This is ascertained from\r\nthe text of the Gospel where Christ said: \"These are like those of whom\r\nIsaiah said, They have eyes and see not, they have ears and hear not; and\r\nI healed them.\"(89)\r\n\r\nThe meaning is not that the Manifestations are unable to perform miracles,\r\nfor They have all power. But for Them inner sight, spiritual healing and\r\neternal life are the valuable and important things. Consequently, whenever\r\nit is recorded in the Holy Books that such a one was blind and recovered\r\nhis sight, the meaning is that he was inwardly blind, and that he obtained\r\nspiritual vision, or that he was ignorant and became wise, or that he was\r\nnegligent and became heedful, or that he was worldly and became heavenly.\r\n\r\nAs this inner sight, hearing, life and healing are eternal, they are of\r\nimportance. What, comparatively, is the importance, the value and the\r\nworth of this animal life with its powers? In a few days it will cease\r\nlike fleeting thoughts. For example, if one relights an extinguished lamp,\r\nit will again become extinguished; but the light of the sun is always\r\nluminous. This is of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23: THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the meaning of Christ's resurrection after three days?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The resurrections of the Divine Manifestations are not of the\r\nbody. All Their states, Their conditions, Their acts, the things They have\r\nestablished, Their teachings, Their expressions, Their parables and Their\r\ninstructions have a spiritual and divine signification, and have no\r\nconnection with material things. For example, there is the subject of\r\nChrist's coming from heaven: it is clearly stated in many places in the\r\nGospel that the Son of man came from heaven, He is in heaven, and He will\r\ngo to heaven. So in chapter 6, verse 38, of the Gospel of John it is\r\nwritten: \"For I came down from heaven\"; and also in verse 42 we find: \"And\r\nthey said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother\r\nwe know? How is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?\" Also in\r\nJohn, chapter 3, verse 13: \"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He\r\nthat came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nObserve that it is said, \"The Son of man is in heaven,\" while at that time\r\nChrist was on earth. Notice also that it is said that Christ came from\r\nheaven, though He came from the womb of Mary, and His body was born of\r\nMary. It is clear, then, that when it is said that the Son of man is come\r\nfrom heaven, this has not an outward but an inward signification; it is a\r\nspiritual, not a material, fact. The meaning is that though, apparently,\r\nChrist was born from the womb of Mary, in reality He came from heaven,\r\nfrom the center of the Sun of Reality, from the Divine World, and the\r\nSpiritual Kingdom. And as it has become evident that Christ came from the\r\nspiritual heaven of the Divine Kingdom, therefore, His disappearance under\r\nthe earth for three days has an inner signification and is not an outward\r\nfact. In the same way, His resurrection from the interior of the earth is\r\nalso symbolical; it is a spiritual and divine fact, and not material; and\r\nlikewise His ascension to heaven is a spiritual and not material\r\nascension.\r\n\r\nBeside these explanations, it has been established and proved by science\r\nthat the visible heaven is a limitless area, void and empty, where\r\ninnumerable stars and planets revolve.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we say that the meaning of Christ's resurrection is as follows:\r\nthe disciples were troubled and agitated after the martyrdom of Christ.\r\nThe Reality of Christ, which signifies His teachings, His bounties, His\r\nperfections and His spiritual power, was hidden and concealed for two or\r\nthree days after His martyrdom, and was not resplendent and manifest. No,\r\nrather it was lost, for the believers were few in number and were troubled\r\nand agitated. The Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body; and when after\r\nthree days the disciples became assured and steadfast, and began to serve\r\nthe Cause of Christ, and resolved to spread the divine teachings, putting\r\nHis counsels into practice, and arising to serve Him, the Reality of\r\nChrist became resplendent and His bounty appeared; His religion found\r\nlife; His teachings and His admonitions became evident and visible. In\r\nother words, the Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body until the life\r\nand the bounty of the Holy Spirit surrounded it.\r\n\r\nSuch is the meaning of the resurrection of Christ, and this was a true\r\nresurrection. But as the clergy have neither understood the meaning of the\r\nGospels nor comprehended the symbols, therefore, it has been said that\r\nreligion is in contradiction to science, and science in opposition to\r\nreligion, as, for example, this subject of the ascension of Christ with an\r\nelemental body to the visible heaven is contrary to the science of\r\nmathematics. But when the truth of this subject becomes clear, and the\r\nsymbol is explained, science in no way contradicts it; but, on the\r\ncontrary, science and the intelligence affirm it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24: THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT UPON THE APOSTLES\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the manner, and what is the meaning, of the descent of\r\nthe Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, as described in the Gospel?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The descent of the Holy Spirit is not like the entrance of air\r\ninto man; it is an expression and a simile, rather than an exact or a\r\nliteral image. No, rather it is like the entrance of the image of the sun\r\ninto the mirror--that is to say, its splendor becomes apparent in it.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Christ the disciples were troubled, and their ideas and\r\nthoughts were discordant and contradictory; later they became firm and\r\nunited, and at the feast of Pentecost they gathered together and detached\r\nthemselves from the things of this world. Disregarding themselves, they\r\nrenounced their comfort and worldly happiness, sacrificing their body and\r\nsoul to the Beloved, abandoning their houses, and becoming wanderers and\r\nhomeless, even forgetting their own existence. Then they received the help\r\nof God, and the power of the Holy Spirit became manifested; the\r\nspirituality of Christ triumphed, and the love of God reigned. They were\r\ngiven help at that time and dispersed in different directions, teaching\r\nthe Cause of God, and giving forth proofs and evidences.\r\n\r\nSo the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles means their attraction\r\nby the Christ Spirit, whereby they acquired stability and firmness.\r\nThrough the spirit of the love of God they gained a new life, and they saw\r\nChrist living, helping and protecting them. They were like drops, and they\r\nbecame seas; they were like feeble insects, and they became majestic\r\neagles; they were weak and became powerful. They were like mirrors facing\r\nthe sun; verily, some of the light became manifest in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25: THE HOLY SPIRIT\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the Holy Spirit?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The Holy Spirit is the Bounty of God and the luminous rays which\r\nemanate from the Manifestations; for the focus of the rays of the Sun of\r\nReality was Christ, and from this glorious focus, which is the Reality of\r\nChrist, the Bounty of God reflected upon the other mirrors which were the\r\nreality of the Apostles. The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles\r\nsignifies that the glorious divine bounties reflected and appeared in\r\ntheir reality. Moreover, entrance and exit, descent and ascent, are\r\ncharacteristics of bodies and not of spirits--that is to say, sensible\r\nrealities enter and come forth, but intellectual subtleties and mental\r\nrealities, such as intelligence, love, knowledge, imagination and thought,\r\ndo not enter, nor come forth, nor descend, but rather they have direct\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nFor example, knowledge, which is a state attained to by the intelligence,\r\nis an intellectual condition; and entering and coming out of the mind are\r\nimaginary conditions; but the mind is connected with the acquisition of\r\nknowledge, like images reflected in a mirror.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as it is evident and clear that the intellectual realities do\r\nnot enter and descend, and it is absolutely impossible that the Holy\r\nSpirit should ascend and descend, enter, come out or penetrate, it can\r\nonly be that the Holy Spirit appears in splendor, as the sun appears in\r\nthe mirror.\r\n\r\nIn some passages in the Holy Books the Spirit is spoken of, signifying a\r\ncertain person, as it is currently said in speech and conversation that\r\nsuch a person is an embodied spirit, or he is a personification of mercy\r\nand generosity. In this case, it is the light we look at, and not the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nIn the Gospel of John, in speaking of the Promised One Who was to come\r\nafter Christ, it is said in chapter 16, verses 12, 13: \"I have yet many\r\nthings to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the\r\nSpirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall\r\nnot speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak.\"\r\n\r\nNow consider carefully that from these words, \"for He shall not speak of\r\nHimself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak,\" it is clear\r\nthat the Spirit of truth is embodied in a Man Who has individuality, Who\r\nhas ears to hear and a tongue to speak. In the same way the name \"Spirit\r\nof God\" is used in relation to Christ, as you speak of a light, meaning\r\nboth the light and the lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26: THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST AND THE DAY OF JUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said in the Holy Books that Christ will come again, and that His\r\ncoming depends upon the fulfillment of certain signs: when He comes, it\r\nwill be with these signs. For example, \"The sun will be darkened, and the\r\nmoon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven....\r\nAnd then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall\r\nall the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man\r\ncoming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.\"(90)\r\nBaha'u'llah has explained these verses in the Kitab-i-Iqan.(91) There is\r\nno need of repetition; refer to it, and you will understand these sayings.\r\n\r\nBut I have something further to say upon this subject. At His first coming\r\nChrist also came from heaven, as it is explicitly stated in the Gospel.\r\nChrist Himself says: \"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that\r\ncame down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\"(92)\r\n\r\nIt is clear to all that Christ came from heaven, although apparently He\r\ncame from the womb of Mary. At the first coming He came from heaven,\r\nthough apparently from the womb; in the same way, also, at His second\r\ncoming He will come from heaven, though apparently from the womb. The\r\nconditions that are indicated in the Gospel for the second coming of\r\nChrist are the same as those that were mentioned for the first coming, as\r\nwe said before.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Isaiah announces that the Messiah will conquer the East and\r\nthe West, and all nations of the world will come under His shadow, that\r\nHis Kingdom will be established, that He will come from an unknown place,\r\nthat the sinners will be judged, and that justice will prevail to such a\r\ndegree that the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and the kid, the sucking\r\nchild and the asp, shall all gather at one spring, and in one meadow, and\r\none dwelling.(93) The first coming was also under these conditions, though\r\noutwardly none of them came to pass. Therefore, the Jews rejected Christ,\r\nand, God forbid! called the Messiah masi_kh_,(94) considered Him to be the\r\ndestroyer of the edifice of God, regarded Him as the breaker of the\r\nSabbath and the Law, and sentenced Him to death. Nevertheless, each one of\r\nthese conditions had a signification that the Jews did not understand;\r\ntherefore, they were debarred from perceiving the truth of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe second coming of Christ also will be in like manner: the signs and\r\nconditions which have been spoken of all have meanings, and are not to be\r\ntaken literally. Among other things it is said that the stars will fall\r\nupon the earth. The stars are endless and innumerable, and modern\r\nmathematicians have established and proved scientifically that the globe\r\nof the sun is estimated to be about one million and a half times greater\r\nthan the earth, and each of the fixed stars to be a thousand times larger\r\nthan the sun. If these stars were to fall upon the surface of the earth,\r\nhow could they find place there? It would be as though a thousand million\r\nof Himalaya mountains were to fall upon a grain of mustard seed. According\r\nto reason and science this thing is quite impossible. What is even more\r\nstrange is that Christ said: \"Perhaps I shall come when you are yet\r\nasleep, for the coming of the Son of man is like the coming of a\r\nthief.\"(95) Perhaps the thief will be in the house, and the owner will not\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\nIt is clear and evident that these signs have symbolic signification, and\r\nthat they are not literal. They are fully explained in the Kitab-i-Iqan.\r\nRefer to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27: THE TRINITY\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the meaning of the Trinity, of the Three Persons in One?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The Divine Reality, which is purified and sanctified from the\r\nunderstanding of human beings and which can never be imagined by the\r\npeople of wisdom and of intelligence, is exempt from all conception. That\r\nLordly Reality admits of no division; for division and multiplicity are\r\nproperties of creatures which are contingent existences, and not accidents\r\nwhich happen to the self-existent.\r\n\r\nThe Divine Reality is sanctified from singleness, then how much more from\r\nplurality. The descent of that Lordly Reality into conditions and degrees\r\nwould be equivalent to imperfection and contrary to perfection, and is,\r\ntherefore, absolutely impossible. It perpetually has been, and is, in the\r\nexaltation of holiness and sanctity. All that is mentioned of the\r\nManifestations and Dawning-places of God signifies the divine reflection,\r\nand not a descent into the conditions of existence.(96)\r\n\r\nGod is pure perfection, and creatures are but imperfections. For God to\r\ndescend into the conditions of existence would be the greatest of\r\nimperfections; on the contrary, His manifestation, His appearance, His\r\nrising are like the reflection of the sun in a clear, pure, polished\r\nmirror. All the creatures are evident signs of God, like the earthly\r\nbeings upon all of which the rays of the sun shine. But upon the plains,\r\nthe mountains, the trees and fruits, only a portion of the light shines,\r\nthrough which they become visible, and are reared, and attain to the\r\nobject of their existence, while the Perfect Man(97) is in the condition\r\nof a clear mirror in which the Sun of Reality becomes visible and manifest\r\nwith all its qualities and perfections. So the Reality of Christ was a\r\nclear and polished mirror of the greatest purity and fineness. The Sun of\r\nReality, the Essence of Divinity, reflected itself in this mirror and\r\nmanifested its light and heat in it; but from the exaltation of its\r\nholiness, and the heaven of its sanctity, the Sun did not descend to dwell\r\nand abide in the mirror. No, it continues to subsist in its exaltation and\r\nsublimity, while appearing and becoming manifest in the mirror in beauty\r\nand perfection.\r\n\r\nNow if we say that we have seen the Sun in two mirrors--one the Christ and\r\none the Holy Spirit--that is to say, that we have seen three Suns, one in\r\nheaven and the two others on the earth, we speak truly. And if we say that\r\nthere is one Sun, and it is pure singleness, and has no partner and equal,\r\nwe again speak truly.\r\n\r\nThe epitome of the discourse is that the Reality of Christ was a clear\r\nmirror, and the Sun of Reality--that is to say, the Essence of Oneness,\r\nwith its infinite perfections and attributes--became visible in the mirror.\r\nThe meaning is not that the Sun, which is the Essence of the Divinity,\r\nbecame divided and multiplied--for the Sun is one--but it appeared in the\r\nmirror. This is why Christ said, \"The Father is in the Son,\" meaning that\r\nthe Sun is visible and manifest in this mirror.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Spirit is the Bounty of God which becomes visible and evident in\r\nthe Reality of Christ. The Sonship station is the heart of Christ, and the\r\nHoly Spirit is the station of the spirit of Christ. Hence it has become\r\ncertain and proved that the Essence of Divinity is absolutely unique and\r\nhas no equal, no likeness, no equivalent.\r\n\r\nThis is the signification of the Three Persons of the Trinity. If it were\r\notherwise, the foundations of the Religion of God would rest upon an\r\nillogical proposition which the mind could never conceive, and how can the\r\nmind be forced to believe a thing which it cannot conceive? A thing cannot\r\nbe grasped by the intelligence except when it is clothed in an\r\nintelligible form; otherwise, it is but an effort of the imagination.\r\n\r\nIt has now become clear, from this explanation, what is the meaning of the\r\nThree Persons of the Trinity. The Oneness of God is also proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28: EXPLANATION OF VERSE FIVE, CHAPTER SEVENTEEN, OF THE GOSPEL OF ST.\r\nJOHN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self, with the glory\r\nwhich I had with Thee before the world was.\"(98)\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of priorities: one is essential and is not preceded by\r\na cause, but its existence is in itself, as, for example, the sun has\r\nlight in itself, for its shining is not dependent on the light of other\r\nstars. This is called an essential light. But the light of the moon is\r\nreceived from the sun, for the moon is dependent on the sun for its light;\r\ntherefore, the sun, with regard to light, is the cause, and the moon\r\nbecomes the effect. The former is the ancient, the precedent, the\r\nantecedent, while the latter is the preceded and the last.\r\n\r\nThe second sort of preexistence is the preexistence of time, and that has\r\nno beginning. The Word of God is sanctified from time.(99) The past, the\r\npresent, the future, all, in relation to God, are equal. Yesterday, today,\r\ntomorrow do not exist in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the same way there is a priority with regard to glory--that is to say,\r\nthe most glorious precedes the glorious. Therefore, the Reality of Christ,\r\nWho is the Word of God, with regard to essence, attributes and glory,\r\ncertainly precedes the creatures. Before appearing in the human form, the\r\nWord of God was in the utmost sanctity and glory, existing in perfect\r\nbeauty and splendor in the height of its magnificence. When through the\r\nwisdom of God the Most High it shone from the heights of glory in the\r\nworld of the body, the Word of God, through this body, became oppressed,\r\nso that it fell into the hands of the Jews, and became the captive of the\r\ntyrannical and ignorant, and at last was crucified. That is why He\r\naddressed God, saying: \"Free Me from the bonds of the world of the body,\r\nand liberate Me from this cage, so that I may ascend to the heights of\r\nhonor and glory, and attain unto the former grandeur and might which\r\nexisted before the bodily world, that I may rejoice in the eternal world\r\nand may ascend to the original abode, the placeless world, the invisible\r\nkingdom.\"\r\n\r\nIt is thus that you see even in the kingdom of this world--that is to say,\r\nin the realm of souls and countries--that the glory and the grandeur of\r\nChrist appeared in this earth after His ascension. When in the world of\r\nthe body He was subject to the contempt and jeers of the weakest nation of\r\nthe world, the Jews, who thought it fitting to set a crown of thorns upon\r\nHis sacred head. But after His ascension the bejeweled crowns of all the\r\nkings were humbled and bowed before the crown of thorns.\r\n\r\nBehold the glory that the Word of God attained even in this world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29: EXPLANATION OF VERSE TWENTY-TWO, CHAPTER FIFTEEN, OF THE FIRST EPISTLE\r\nOF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--In verse 22 of chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians it is written: \"For\r\nas in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" What is\r\nthe meaning of these words?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Know that there are two natures in man: the physical nature and\r\nthe spiritual nature. The physical nature is inherited from Adam, and the\r\nspiritual nature is inherited from the Reality of the Word of God, which\r\nis the spirituality of Christ. The physical nature is born of Adam, but\r\nthe spiritual nature is born from the bounty of the Holy Spirit. The first\r\nis the source of all imperfection; the second is the source of all\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe Christ sacrificed Himself so that men might be freed from the\r\nimperfections of the physical nature and might become possessed of the\r\nvirtues of the spiritual nature. This spiritual nature, which came into\r\nexistence through the bounty of the Divine Reality, is the union of all\r\nperfections and appears through the breath of the Holy Spirit. It is the\r\ndivine perfections; it is light, spirituality, guidance, exaltation, high\r\naspiration, justice, love, grace, kindness to all, philanthropy, the\r\nessence of life. It is the reflection of the splendor of the Sun of\r\nReality.\r\n\r\nThe Christ is the central point of the Holy Spirit: He is born of the Holy\r\nSpirit; He is raised up by the Holy Spirit; He is the descendant of the\r\nHoly Spirit--that is to say, that the Reality of Christ does not descend\r\nfrom Adam; no, it is born of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, this verse in\r\nCorinthians, \"As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made\r\nalive,\" means, according to this terminology, that Adam(100) is the father\r\nof man--that is to say, He is the cause of the physical life of mankind;\r\nHis was the physical fatherhood. He is a living soul, but He is not the\r\ngiver of spiritual life, whereas Christ is the cause of the spiritual life\r\nof man, and with regard to the spirit, His was the spiritual fatherhood.\r\nAdam is a living soul; Christ is a quickening spirit.\r\n\r\nThis physical world of man is subject to the power of the lusts, and sin\r\nis the consequence of this power of the lusts, for it is not subject to\r\nthe laws of justice and holiness. The body of man is a captive of nature;\r\nit will act in accordance with whatever nature orders. It is, therefore,\r\ncertain that sins such as anger, jealousy, dispute, covetousness, avarice,\r\nignorance, prejudice, hatred, pride and tyranny exist in the physical\r\nworld. All these brutal qualities exist in the nature of man. A man who\r\nhas not had a spiritual education is a brute. Like the savages of Africa,\r\nwhose actions, habits and morals are purely sensual, they act according to\r\nthe demands of nature to such a degree that they rend and eat one another.\r\nThus it is evident that the physical world of man is a world of sin. In\r\nthis physical world man is not distinguished from the animal.\r\n\r\nAll sin comes from the demands of nature, and these demands, which arise\r\nfrom the physical qualities, are not sins with respect to the animals,\r\nwhile for man they are sin. The animal is the source of imperfections,\r\nsuch as anger, sensuality, jealousy, avarice, cruelty, pride: all these\r\ndefects are found in animals but do not constitute sins. But in man they\r\nare sins.\r\n\r\nAdam is the cause of man's physical life; but the Reality of Christ--that\r\nis to say, the Word of God--is the cause of spiritual life. It is \"a\r\nquickening spirit,\" meaning that all the imperfections which come from the\r\nrequirements of the physical life of man are transformed into human\r\nperfections by the teachings and education of that spirit. Therefore,\r\nChrist was a quickening spirit, and the cause of life in all mankind.\r\n\r\nAdam was the cause of physical life, and as the physical world of man is\r\nthe world of imperfections, and imperfections are the equivalent of death,\r\nPaul compared the physical imperfections to death.\r\n\r\nBut the mass of the Christians believe that, as Adam ate of the forbidden\r\ntree, He sinned in that He disobeyed, and that the disastrous consequences\r\nof this disobedience have been transmitted as a heritage and have remained\r\namong His descendants. Hence Adam became the cause of the death of\r\nhumanity. This explanation is unreasonable and evidently wrong, for it\r\nmeans that all men, even the Prophets and the Messengers of God, without\r\ncommitting any sin or fault, but simply because they are the posterity of\r\nAdam, have become without reason guilty sinners, and until the day of the\r\nsacrifice of Christ were held captive in hell in painful torment. This is\r\nfar from the justice of God. If Adam was a sinner, what is the sin of\r\nAbraham? What is the fault of Isaac, or of Joseph? Of what is Moses\r\nguilty?\r\n\r\nBut Christ, Who is the Word of God, sacrificed Himself. This has two\r\nmeanings, an apparent and an esoteric meaning. The outward meaning is\r\nthis: Christ's intention was to represent and promote a Cause which was to\r\neducate the human world, to quicken the children of Adam, and to enlighten\r\nall mankind; and since to represent such a great Cause--a Cause which was\r\nantagonistic to all the people of the world and all the nations and\r\nkingdoms--meant that He would be killed and crucified, so Christ in\r\nproclaiming His mission sacrificed His life. He regarded the cross as a\r\nthrone, the wound as a balm, the poison as honey and sugar. He arose to\r\nteach and educate men, and so He sacrificed Himself to give the spirit of\r\nlife. He perished in body so as to quicken others by the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe second meaning of sacrifice is this: Christ was like a seed, and this\r\nseed sacrificed its own form so that the tree might grow and develop.\r\nAlthough the form of the seed was destroyed, its reality became apparent\r\nin perfect majesty and beauty in the form of a tree.\r\n\r\nThe position of Christ was that of absolute perfection; He made His divine\r\nperfections shine like the sun upon all believing souls, and the bounties\r\nof the light shone and radiated in the reality of men. This is why He\r\nsays: \"I am the bread which descended from heaven; whosoever shall eat of\r\nthis bread will not die\"(101)--that is to say, that whosoever shall partake\r\nof this divine food will attain unto eternal life: that is, every one who\r\npartakes of this bounty and receives these perfections will find eternal\r\nlife, will obtain preexistent favors, will be freed from the darkness of\r\nerror, and will be illuminated by the light of His guidance.\r\n\r\nThe form of the seed was sacrificed for the tree, but its perfections,\r\nbecause of this sacrifice, became evident and apparent--the tree, the\r\nbranches, the leaves and the blossoms being concealed in the seed. When\r\nthe form of the seed was sacrificed, its perfections appeared in the\r\nperfect form of leaves, blossoms and fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30: ADAM AND EVE\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the truth of the story of Adam, and His eating of the\r\nfruit of the tree?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--In the Bible it is written that God put Adam in the garden of\r\nEden, to cultivate and take care of it, and said to Him: \"Eat of every\r\ntree of the garden except the tree of good and evil, for if You eat of\r\nthat, You will die.\"(102) Then it is said that God caused Adam to sleep,\r\nand He took one of His ribs and created woman in order that she might be\r\nHis companion. After that it is said the serpent induced the woman to eat\r\nof the tree, saying: \"God has forbidden you to eat of the tree in order\r\nthat your eyes may not be opened, and that you may not know good from\r\nevil.\"(103) Then Eve ate from the tree and gave unto Adam, Who also ate;\r\ntheir eyes were opened, they found themselves naked, and they hid their\r\nbodies with leaves. In consequence of this act they received the\r\nreproaches of God. God said to Adam: \"Hast Thou eaten of the forbidden\r\ntree?\" Adam answered: \"Eve tempted Me, and I did eat.\" God then reproved\r\nEve; Eve said: \"The serpent tempted me, and I did eat.\" For this the\r\nserpent was cursed, and enmity was put between the serpent and Eve, and\r\nbetween their descendants. And God said: \"The man is become like unto Us,\r\nknowing good and evil, and perhaps He will eat of the tree of life and\r\nlive forever.\" So God guarded the tree of life.(104)\r\n\r\nIf we take this story in its apparent meaning, according to the\r\ninterpretation of the masses, it is indeed extraordinary. The intelligence\r\ncannot accept it, affirm it, or imagine it; for such arrangements, such\r\ndetails, such speeches and reproaches are far from being those of an\r\nintelligent man, how much less of the Divinity--that Divinity Who has\r\norganized this infinite universe in the most perfect form, and its\r\ninnumerable inhabitants with absolute system, strength and perfection.\r\n\r\nWe must reflect a little: if the literal meaning of this story were\r\nattributed to a wise man, certainly all would logically deny that this\r\narrangement, this invention, could have emanated from an intelligent\r\nbeing. Therefore, this story of Adam and Eve who ate from the tree, and\r\ntheir expulsion from Paradise, must be thought of simply as a symbol. It\r\ncontains divine mysteries and universal meanings, and it is capable of\r\nmarvelous explanations. Only those who are initiated into mysteries, and\r\nthose who are near the Court of the All-Powerful, are aware of these\r\nsecrets. Hence these verses of the Bible have numerous meanings.\r\n\r\nWe will explain one of them, and we will say: Adam signifies the heavenly\r\nspirit of Adam, and Eve His human soul. For in some passages in the Holy\r\nBooks where women are mentioned, they represent the soul of man. The tree\r\nof good and evil signifies the human world; for the spiritual and divine\r\nworld is purely good and absolutely luminous, but in the human world light\r\nand darkness, good and evil, exist as opposite conditions.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the serpent is attachment to the human world. This\r\nattachment of the spirit to the human world led the soul and spirit of\r\nAdam from the world of freedom to the world of bondage and caused Him to\r\nturn from the Kingdom of Unity to the human world. When the soul and\r\nspirit of Adam entered the human world, He came out from the paradise of\r\nfreedom and fell into the world of bondage. From the height of purity and\r\nabsolute goodness, He entered into the world of good and evil.\r\n\r\nThe tree of life is the highest degree of the world of existence: the\r\nposition of the Word of God, and the supreme Manifestation. Therefore,\r\nthat position has been preserved; and, at the appearance of the most noble\r\nsupreme Manifestation, it became apparent and clear. For the position of\r\nAdam, with regard to the appearance and manifestation of the divine\r\nperfections, was in the embryonic condition; the position of Christ was\r\nthe condition of maturity and the age of reason; and the rising of the\r\nGreatest Luminary(105) was the condition of the perfection of the essence\r\nand of the qualities. This is why in the supreme Paradise the tree of life\r\nis the expression for the center of absolutely pure sanctity--that is to\r\nsay, of the divine supreme Manifestation. From the days of Adam until the\r\ndays of Christ, They spoke little of eternal life and the heavenly\r\nuniversal perfections. This tree of life was the position of the Reality\r\nof Christ; through His manifestation it was planted and adorned with\r\neverlasting fruits.\r\n\r\nNow consider how far this meaning conforms to the reality. For the spirit\r\nand the soul of Adam, when they were attached to the human world, passed\r\nfrom the world of freedom into the world of bondage, and His descendants\r\ncontinued in bondage. This attachment of the soul and spirit to the human\r\nworld, which is sin, was inherited by the descendants of Adam, and is the\r\nserpent which is always in the midst of, and at enmity with, the spirits\r\nand the descendants of Adam. That enmity continues and endures. For\r\nattachment to the world has become the cause of the bondage of spirits,\r\nand this bondage is identical with sin, which has been transmitted from\r\nAdam to His posterity. It is because of this attachment that men have been\r\ndeprived of essential spirituality and exalted position.\r\n\r\nWhen the sanctified breezes of Christ and the holy light of the Greatest\r\nLuminary(106) were spread abroad, the human realities--that is to say,\r\nthose who turned toward the Word of God and received the profusion of His\r\nbounties--were saved from this attachment and sin, obtained everlasting\r\nlife, were delivered from the chains of bondage, and attained to the world\r\nof liberty. They were freed from the vices of the human world, and were\r\nblessed by the virtues of the Kingdom. This is the meaning of the words of\r\nChrist, \"I gave My blood for the life of the world\"(107)--that is to say, I\r\nhave chosen all these troubles, these sufferings, calamities, and even the\r\ngreatest martyrdom, to attain this object, the remission of sins (that is,\r\nthe detachment of spirits from the human world, and their attraction to\r\nthe divine world) in order that souls may arise who will be the very\r\nessence of the guidance of mankind, and the manifestations of the\r\nperfections of the Supreme Kingdom.\r\n\r\nObserve that if, according to the suppositions of the People of the\r\nBook,(108) the meaning were taken in its exoteric sense, it would be\r\nabsolute injustice and complete predestination. If Adam sinned by going\r\nnear the forbidden tree, what was the sin of the glorious Abraham, and\r\nwhat was the error of Moses the Interlocutor? What was the crime of Noah\r\nthe Prophet? What was the transgression of Joseph the Truthful? What was\r\nthe iniquity of the Prophets of God, and what was the trespass of John the\r\nChaste? Would the justice of God have allowed these enlightened\r\nManifestations, on account of the sin of Adam, to find torment in hell\r\nuntil Christ came and by the sacrifice of Himself saved them from\r\nexcruciating tortures? Such an idea is beyond every law and rule and\r\ncannot be accepted by any intelligent person.\r\n\r\nNo; it means what has already been said: Adam is the spirit of Adam, and\r\nEve is His soul; the tree is the human world, and the serpent is that\r\nattachment to this world which constitutes sin, and which has infected the\r\ndescendants of Adam. Christ by His holy breezes saved men from this\r\nattachment and freed them from this sin. The sin in Adam is relative to\r\nHis position. Although from this attachment there proceed results,\r\nnevertheless, attachment to the earthly world, in relation to attachment\r\nto the spiritual world, is considered as a sin. The good deeds of the\r\nrighteous are the sins of the Near Ones. This is established. So bodily\r\npower is not only defective in relation to spiritual power; it is weakness\r\nin comparison. In the same way, physical life, in comparison with eternal\r\nlife in the Kingdom, is considered as death. So Christ called the physical\r\nlife death, and said: \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"(109) Though those\r\nsouls possessed physical life, yet in His eyes that life was death.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the meanings of the biblical story of Adam. Reflect until\r\nyou discover the others.\r\n\r\nSalutations be upon you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31: EXPLANATION OF BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--\"Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall\r\nbe forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not\r\nbe forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of\r\nman, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy\r\nGhost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the\r\nworld to come.\"--(Matt. 12:31-32)\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The holy realities of the Manifestations of God have two spiritual\r\npositions. One is the place of manifestation, which can be compared to the\r\nposition of the globe of the sun, and the other is the resplendency of the\r\nmanifestation, which is like its light and radiance; these are the\r\nperfections of God--in other words, the Holy Spirit. For the Holy Spirit is\r\nthe divine bounties and lordly perfections, and these divine perfections\r\nare as the rays and heat of the sun. The brilliant rays of the sun\r\nconstitute its being, and without them it would not be the sun. If the\r\nmanifestation and the reflection of the divine perfections were not in\r\nChrist, Jesus would not be the Messiah. He is a Manifestation because He\r\nreflects in Himself the divine perfections. The Prophets of God are\r\nmanifestations for the lordly perfections--that is, the Holy Spirit is\r\napparent in Them.\r\n\r\nIf a soul remains far from the manifestation, he may yet be awakened; for\r\nhe did not recognize the manifestation of the divine perfections. But if\r\nhe loathe the divine perfections themselves--in other words, the Holy\r\nSpirit--it is evident that he is like a bat which hates the light.\r\n\r\nThis detestation of the light has no remedy and cannot be forgiven--that is\r\nto say, it is impossible for him to come near unto God. This lamp is a\r\nlamp because of its light; without the light it would not be a lamp. Now\r\nif a soul has an aversion for the light of the lamp, he is, as it were,\r\nblind, and cannot comprehend the light; and blindness is the cause of\r\neverlasting banishment from God.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the souls receive grace from the bounty of the Holy\r\nSpirit which appears in the Manifestations of God, and not from the\r\npersonality of the Manifestation. Therefore, if a soul does not receive\r\ngrace from the bounties of the Holy Spirit, he remains deprived of the\r\ndivine gift, and the banishment itself puts the soul beyond the reach of\r\npardon.\r\n\r\nThis is why many people who were the enemies of the Manifestations, and\r\nwho did not recognize Them, when once they had known Them became Their\r\nfriends. So enmity toward the Manifestation did not become the cause of\r\nperpetual banishment, for they who indulged in it were the enemies of the\r\nlight-holders, not knowing that They were the shining lights of God. They\r\nwere not the enemies of the light, and when once they understood that the\r\nlight-holder was the place of manifestation of the light, they became\r\nsincere friends of it.\r\n\r\nThe meaning is this: to remain far from the light-holder does not entail\r\neverlasting banishment, for one may become awakened and vigilant; but\r\nenmity toward the light is the cause of everlasting banishment, and for\r\nthis there is no remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32: EXPLANATION OF THE VERSE \"FOR MANY ARE CALLED BUT FEW ARE CHOSEN\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--In the Gospel Christ said: \"Many are called, but few are\r\nchosen,\"(110) and in the Qur'an it is written: \"He will confer particular\r\nmercy on whom He pleaseth.\" What is the wisdom of this?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Know that the order and the perfection of the whole universe\r\nrequire that existence should appear in numberless forms. For existing\r\nbeings could not be embodied in only one degree, one station, one kind,\r\none species and one class; undoubtedly, the difference of degrees and\r\ndistinction of forms, and the variety of genus and species, are\r\nnecessary--that is to say, the degree of mineral, vegetable, animal\r\nsubstances, and of man, are inevitable; for the world could not be\r\narranged, adorned, organized and perfected with man alone. In the same\r\nway, with only animals, only plants or only minerals, this world could not\r\nshow forth beautiful scenery, exact organization and exquisite adornment.\r\nWithout doubt it is because of the varieties of degrees, stations, species\r\nand classes that existence becomes resplendent with utmost perfection.\r\n\r\nFor example, if this tree were entirely fruit, the vegetable perfections\r\ncould not be attained; for leaves, blossoms and fruits are all necessary\r\nso that the tree may be adorned with utmost beauty and perfection.\r\n\r\nIn the same way consider the body of man. It must be composed of different\r\norgans, parts and members. Human beauty and perfection require the\r\nexistence of the ear, the eye, the brain and even that of the nails and\r\nhair; if man were all brain, eyes or ears, it would be equivalent to\r\nimperfection. So the absence of hair, eyelashes, teeth and nails would be\r\nan absolute defect, though in comparison with the eye they are without\r\nfeeling, and in this resemble the mineral and plant; but their absence in\r\nthe body of man is necessarily faulty and displeasing.\r\n\r\nAs the degrees of existence are different and various, some beings are\r\nhigher in the scale than others. Therefore, it is by the will and wish of\r\nGod that some creatures are chosen for the highest degree, as man, and\r\nsome others are placed in the middle degree, as the vegetable, and some\r\nare left in the lowest degree, like the mineral.\r\n\r\nIt is from the bounty of God that man is selected for the highest degree;\r\nand the differences which exist between men in regard to spiritual\r\nprogress and heavenly perfections are also due to the choice of the\r\nCompassionate One. For faith, which is life eternal, is the sign of\r\nbounty, and not the result of justice. The flame of the fire of love, in\r\nthis world of earth and water, comes through the power of attraction and\r\nnot by effort and striving. Nevertheless, by effort and perseverance,\r\nknowledge, science and other perfections can be acquired; but only the\r\nlight of the Divine Beauty can transport and move the spirits through the\r\nforce of attraction. Therefore, it is said: \"Many are called, but few are\r\nchosen.\"(111)\r\n\r\nBut the material beings are not despised, judged and held responsible for\r\ntheir own degree and station. For example, mineral, vegetable and animal\r\nin their various degrees are acceptable; but if in their own degree they\r\nremain imperfect, they are blamable, the degree itself being purely\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nThe differences among mankind are of two sorts: one is a difference of\r\nstation, and this difference is not blameworthy. The other is a difference\r\nof faith and assurance; the loss of these is blameworthy, for then the\r\nsoul is overwhelmed by his desires and passions, which deprive him of\r\nthese blessings and prevent him from feeling the power of attraction of\r\nthe love of God. Though that man is praiseworthy and acceptable in his\r\nstation, yet as he is deprived of the perfections of that degree, he will\r\nbecome a source of imperfections, for which he is held responsible.(112)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33: THE \"RETURN\" SPOKEN OF BY THE PROPHETS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Will you explain the subject of Return?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Baha'u'llah has explained this question fully and clearly in the\r\nIqan.(113) Read it, and the truth of this subject will become apparent.\r\nBut since you have asked about it, I will explain it briefly. We will\r\nbegin to elucidate it from the Gospel, for there it is plainly said that\r\nwhen John, the son of Zacharias, appeared and gave to men the glad tidings\r\nof the Kingdom of God, they asked him, \"Who art thou? Art thou the\r\npromised Messiah?\" He replied, \"I am not the Messiah.\" Then they asked\r\nhim, \"Art thou Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.\"(114) These words prove and\r\nshow that John, the son of Zacharias, was not the promised Elias. But on\r\nthe day of the transfiguration on Mount Tabor Christ said plainly that\r\nJohn, the son of Zacharias, was the promised Elias.\r\n\r\nIn chapter 9, verses 11-13, of the Gospel of Mark, it is said: \"And they\r\nasked Him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come? And He\r\nanswered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all\r\nthings; and how it is written of the Son of man, that He must suffer many\r\nthings, and be set at nought. But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed\r\ncome, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\nIn chapter 17, verse 13, of Matthew, it is said: \"Then the disciples\r\nunderstood that He spake unto them of John the Baptist.\"\r\n\r\nThey asked John the Baptist, \"Are you Elias?\" He answered, \"No, I am not,\"\r\nalthough it is said in the Gospel that John was the promised Elias, and\r\nChrist also said so clearly.(115) Then if John was Elias, why did he say,\r\n\"I am not\"? And if he was not Elias, why did Christ say that he was?\r\n\r\nThe explanation is this: not the personality, but the reality of the\r\nperfections, is meant--that is to say, the same perfections that were in\r\nElias existed in John the Baptist and were exactly realized in him.\r\nTherefore, John the Baptist was the promised Elias. In this case not the\r\nessence,(116) but the qualities, are regarded. For example, there was a\r\nflower last year, and this year there is also a flower; I say the flower\r\nof last year has returned. Now, I do not mean that same flower in its\r\nexact individuality has come back; but as this flower has the same\r\nqualities as that of last year--as it has the same perfume, delicacy, color\r\nand form--I say the flower of last year has returned, and this flower is\r\nthe former flower. When spring comes, we say last year's spring has come\r\nback because all that was found in last year's spring exists in this\r\nspring. That is why Christ said, \"You will see all that happened in the\r\ndays of the former Prophets.\"\r\n\r\nWe will give another illustration. The seed of last year is sown, branches\r\nand leaves grow forth, blossoms and fruits appear, and all has again\r\nreturned to seed. When this second seed is planted, a tree will grow from\r\nit, and once more those branches, leaves, blossoms and fruits will return,\r\nand that tree will appear in perfection. As the beginning was a seed and\r\nthe end is a seed, we say that the seed has returned. When we look at the\r\nsubstance of the tree, it is another substance, but when we look at the\r\nblossoms, leaves and fruits, the same fragrance, delicacy and taste are\r\nproduced. Therefore, the perfection of the tree has returned a second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, if we regard the return of the individual, it is another\r\nindividual; but if we regard the qualities and perfections, the same have\r\nreturned. Therefore, when Christ said, \"This is Elias,\" He meant: this\r\nperson is a manifestation of the bounty, the perfections, the character,\r\nthe qualities and the virtues of Elias. John the Baptist said, \"I am not\r\nElias.\" Christ considered the qualities, the perfections, the character\r\nand the virtues of both, and John regarded his substance and\r\nindividuality. It is like this lamp: it was here last night, and tonight\r\nit is also lighted, and tomorrow night it will also shine. We say that the\r\nlamp of this night is the same light as that of last night, and that it\r\nhas returned. It refers to the light, and not to the oil, the wick or the\r\nholder.\r\n\r\nThis subject is fully and clearly explained in the Kitab-i-Iqan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34: PETER'S CONFESSION OF FAITH\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--In the Gospel of St. Matthew it is said: \"Thou art Peter, and\r\nupon this rock I will build My church.\"(117) What is the meaning of this\r\nverse?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--This utterance of Christ is a confirmation of the statement of\r\nPeter, when Christ asked: Whom do you believe Me to be? and Peter\r\nanswered: I believe that \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Then Christ\r\nsaid to him: \"Thou art Peter\"(118)--for Cephas in Aramaic means rock--\"and\r\nupon this rock I will build My church.\" For the others in answer to Christ\r\nsaid that He was Elias, and some said John the Baptist, and some others\r\nJeremias or one of the Prophets.(119)\r\n\r\nChrist wished by suggestion, or an allusion, to confirm the words of\r\nPeter; so on account of the suitability of his name, Peter, He said: \"and\r\nupon this rock I will build My church,\" meaning, thy belief that Christ is\r\nthe Son of the living God will be the foundation of the Religion of God,\r\nand upon this belief the foundation of the church of God--which is the Law\r\nof God--shall be established.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the tomb of Peter in Rome is doubtful; it is not\r\nauthenticated. Some say it is in Antioch.\r\n\r\nMoreover, let us compare the lives of some of the Popes with the religion\r\nof Christ. Christ, hungry and without shelter, ate herbs in the\r\nwilderness, and was unwilling to hurt the feelings of anyone. The Pope\r\nsits in a carriage covered with gold and passes his time in the utmost\r\nsplendor, amidst such pleasures and luxuries, such riches and adoration,\r\nas kings have never had.\r\n\r\nChrist hurt no one, but some of the Popes killed innocent people: refer to\r\nhistory. How much blood the Popes have shed merely to retain temporal\r\npower! For mere differences of opinion they arrested, imprisoned and slew\r\nthousands of the servants of the world of humanity and learned men who had\r\ndiscovered the secrets of nature. To what a degree they opposed the truth!\r\n\r\nReflect upon the instructions of Christ, and investigate the habits and\r\ncustoms of the Popes. Consider: is there any resemblance between the\r\ninstructions of Christ and the manner of government of the Popes? We do\r\nnot like to criticize, but the history of the Vatican is very\r\nextraordinary. The purport of our argument is this, that the instructions\r\nof Christ are one thing, and the manner of the Papal government is quite\r\nanother; they do not agree. See how many Protestants have been killed by\r\nthe order of the Popes, how many tyrannies and oppressions have been\r\ncountenanced, and how many punishments and tortures have been inflicted!\r\nCan any of the sweet fragrances of Christ be detected in these actions?\r\nNo! in the name of God! These people did not obey Christ, while Saint\r\nBarbara, whose picture is before us, did obey Christ, and followed in His\r\nfootsteps, and put His commands into practice. Among the Popes there are\r\nalso some blessed souls who followed in the footsteps of Christ,\r\nparticularly in the first centuries of the Christian era when temporal\r\nthings were lacking and the tests of God were severe. But when they came\r\ninto possession of governmental power, and worldly honor and prosperity\r\nwere gained, the Papal government entirely forgot Christ and was occupied\r\nwith temporal power, grandeur, comfort and luxuries. It killed people,\r\nopposed the diffusion of learning, tormented the men of science,\r\nobstructed the light of knowledge, and gave the order to slay and to\r\npillage. Thousands of souls, men of science and learning, and sinless\r\nones, perished in the prisons of Rome. With all these proceedings and\r\nactions, how can the Vicarship of Christ be believed in?\r\n\r\nThe Papal See has constantly opposed knowledge; even in Europe it is\r\nadmitted that religion is the opponent of science, and that science is the\r\ndestroyer of the foundations of religion. While the religion of God is the\r\npromoter of truth, the founder of science and knowledge, it is full of\r\ngoodwill for learned men; it is the civilizer of mankind, the discoverer\r\nof the secrets of nature, and the enlightener of the horizons of the\r\nworld. Consequently, how can it be said to oppose knowledge? God forbid!\r\nNay, for God, knowledge is the most glorious gift of man and the most\r\nnoble of human perfections. To oppose knowledge is ignorant, and he who\r\ndetests knowledge and science is not a man, but rather an animal without\r\nintelligence. For knowledge is light, life, felicity, perfection, beauty\r\nand the means of approaching the Threshold of Unity. It is the honor and\r\nglory of the world of humanity, and the greatest bounty of God. Knowledge\r\nis identical with guidance, and ignorance is real error.\r\n\r\nHappy are those who spend their days in gaining knowledge, in discovering\r\nthe secrets of nature, and in penetrating the subtleties of pure truth!\r\nWoe to those who are contented with ignorance, whose hearts are gladdened\r\nby thoughtless imitation, who have fallen into the lowest depths of\r\nignorance and foolishness, and who have wasted their lives!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35: PREDESTINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--If God has knowledge of an action which will be performed by\r\nsomeone, and it has been written on the Tablet of Fate, is it possible to\r\nresist it?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The foreknowledge of a thing is not the cause of its realization;\r\nfor the essential knowledge of God surrounds, in the same way, the\r\nrealities of things, before as well as after their existence, and it does\r\nnot become the cause of their existence. It is a perfection of God. But\r\nthat which was prophesied by the inspiration of God through the tongues of\r\nthe Prophets, concerning the appearance of the Promised One of the Bible,\r\nwas not the cause of the manifestation of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe hidden secrets of the future were revealed to the Prophets, and They\r\nthus became acquainted with the future events which They announced. This\r\nknowledge and these prophecies were not the cause of the occurrences. For\r\nexample, tonight everyone knows that after seven hours the sun will rise,\r\nbut this general foreknowledge does not cause the rising and appearance of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the knowledge of God in the realm of contingency does not\r\nproduce the forms of the things. On the contrary, it is purified from the\r\npast, present and future. It is identical with the reality of the things;\r\nit is not the cause of their occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the record and the mention of a thing in the Book does\r\nnot become the cause of its existence. The Prophets, through the divine\r\ninspiration, knew what would come to pass. For instance, through the\r\ndivine inspiration They knew that Christ would be martyred, and They\r\nannounced it. Now, was Their knowledge and information the cause of the\r\nmartyrdom of Christ? No; this knowledge is a perfection of the Prophets\r\nand did not cause the martyrdom.\r\n\r\nThe mathematicians by astronomical calculations know that at a certain\r\ntime an eclipse of the moon or the sun will occur. Surely this discovery\r\ndoes not cause the eclipse to take place. This is, of course, only an\r\nanalogy and not an exact image.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE: ON THE POWERS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36: THE FIVE ASPECTS OF SPIRIT\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow that, speaking generally, there are five divisions of the spirit.\r\nFirst the vegetable spirit: this is a power which results from the\r\ncombination of elements and the mingling of substances by the decree of\r\nthe Supreme God, and from the influence, the effect and connection of\r\nother existences. When these substances and elements are separated from\r\neach other, the power of growth also ceases to exist. So, to use another\r\nfigure, electricity results from the combination of elements, and when\r\nthese elements are separated, the electric force is dispersed and lost.\r\nSuch is the vegetable spirit.\r\n\r\nAfter this is the animal spirit, which also results from the mingling and\r\ncombination of elements. But this combination is more complete, and\r\nthrough the decree of the Almighty Lord a perfect mingling is obtained,\r\nand the animal spirit--in other words, the power of the senses--is produced.\r\nIt will perceive the reality of things from that which is seen and\r\nvisible, audible, edible, tangible, and that which can be smelled. After\r\nthe dissociation and decomposition of the combined elements this spirit\r\nalso will naturally disappear. It is like this lamp which you see: when\r\nthe oil and wick and fire are brought together, light is the result; but\r\nwhen the oil is finished and the wick consumed, the light will also vanish\r\nand be lost.\r\n\r\nThe human spirit may be likened to the bounty of the sun shining on a\r\nmirror. The body of man, which is composed from the elements, is combined\r\nand mingled in the most perfect form; it is the most solid construction,\r\nthe noblest combination, the most perfect existence. It grows and develops\r\nthrough the animal spirit. This perfected body can be compared to a\r\nmirror, and the human spirit to the sun. Nevertheless, if the mirror\r\nbreaks, the bounty of the sun continues; and if the mirror is destroyed or\r\nceases to exist, no harm will happen to the bounty of the sun, which is\r\neverlasting. This spirit has the power of discovery; it encompasses all\r\nthings. All these wonderful signs, these scientific discoveries, great\r\nenterprises and important historical events which you know are due to it.\r\nFrom the realm of the invisible and hidden, through spiritual power, it\r\nbrought them to the plane of the visible. So man is upon the earth, yet he\r\nmakes discoveries in the heavens. From known realities--that is to say,\r\nfrom the things which are known and visible--he discovers unknown things.\r\nFor example, man is in this hemisphere; but, like Columbus, through the\r\npower of his reason he discovers another hemisphere--that is, America--which\r\nwas until then unknown. His body is heavy, but through the help of\r\nvehicles which he invents, he is able to fly. He is slow of movement, but\r\nby vehicles which he invents he travels to the East and West with extreme\r\nrapidity. Briefly, this power embraces all things.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of man has two aspects: one divine, one satanic--that is to\r\nsay, it is capable of the utmost perfection, or it is capable of the\r\nutmost imperfection. If it acquires virtues, it is the most noble of the\r\nexisting beings; and if it acquires vices, it becomes the most degraded\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe fourth degree of spirit is the heavenly spirit; it is the spirit of\r\nfaith and the bounty of God; it comes from the breath of the Holy Spirit,\r\nand by the divine power it becomes the cause of eternal life. It is the\r\npower which makes the earthly man heavenly, and the imperfect man perfect.\r\nIt makes the impure to be pure, the silent eloquent; it purifies and\r\nsanctifies those made captive by carnal desires; it makes the ignorant\r\nwise.\r\n\r\nThe fifth spirit is the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit is the mediator\r\nbetween God and His creatures. It is like a mirror facing the sun. As the\r\npure mirror receives light from the sun and transmits this bounty to\r\nothers, so the Holy Spirit is the mediator of the Holy Light from the Sun\r\nof Reality, which it gives to the sanctified realities. It is adorned with\r\nall the divine perfections. Every time it appears, the world is renewed,\r\nand a new cycle is founded. The body of the world of humanity puts on a\r\nnew garment. It can be compared to the spring; whenever it comes, the\r\nworld passes from one condition to another. Through the advent of the\r\nseason of spring the black earth and the fields and wildernesses will\r\nbecome verdant and blooming, and all sorts of flowers and sweet-scented\r\nherbs will grow; the trees will have new life, and new fruits will appear,\r\nand a new cycle is founded. The appearance of the Holy Spirit is like\r\nthis. Whenever it appears, it renews the world of humanity and gives a new\r\nspirit to the human realities: it arrays the world of existence in a\r\npraiseworthy garment, dispels the darkness of ignorance, and causes the\r\nradiation of the light of perfections. Christ with this power has renewed\r\nthis cycle; the heavenly spring with the utmost freshness and sweetness\r\nspread its tent in the world of humanity, and the life-giving breeze\r\nperfumed the nostrils of the enlightened ones.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the appearance of Baha'u'llah was like a new springtime\r\nwhich appeared with holy breezes, with the hosts of everlasting life, and\r\nwith heavenly power. It established the Throne of the Divine Kingdom in\r\nthe center of the world and, by the power of the Holy Spirit, revived\r\nsouls and established a new cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37: THE DIVINITY CAN ONLY BE COMPREHENDED THROUGH THE DIVINE\r\nMANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What connection has the Reality of Divinity with the Lordly\r\nRising-places and the Divine Dawning-points?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Know that the Reality of Divinity or the substance of the Essence\r\nof Oneness is pure sanctity and absolute holiness--that is to say, it is\r\nsanctified and exempt from all praise. The whole of the supreme attributes\r\nof the degrees of existence, in reference to this plane, are only\r\nimaginations. It is invisible, incomprehensible, inaccessible, a pure\r\nessence which cannot be described, for the Divine Essence surrounds all\r\nthings. Verily, that which surrounds is greater than the surrounded, and\r\nthe surrounded cannot contain that by which it is surrounded, nor\r\ncomprehend its reality. However far mind may progress, though it may reach\r\nto the final degree of comprehension, the limit of understanding, it\r\nbeholds the divine signs and attributes in the world of creation and not\r\nin the world of God. For the essence and the attributes of the Lord of\r\nUnity are in the heights of sanctity, and for the minds and understandings\r\nthere is no way to approach that position. \"The way is closed, and seeking\r\nis forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the human understanding is a quality of the existence\r\nof man, and that man is a sign of God: how can the quality of the sign\r\nsurround the creator of the sign?--that is to say, how can the\r\nunderstanding, which is a quality of the existence of man, comprehend God?\r\nTherefore, the Reality of the Divinity is hidden from all comprehension,\r\nand concealed from the minds of all men. It is absolutely impossible to\r\nascend to that plane. We see that everything which is lower is powerless\r\nto comprehend the reality of that which is higher. So the stone, the\r\nearth, the tree, however much they may evolve, cannot comprehend the\r\nreality of man and cannot imagine the powers of sight, of hearing, and of\r\nthe other senses, although they are all alike created. Therefore, how can\r\nman, the created, understand the reality of the pure Essence of the\r\nCreator? This plane is unapproachable by the understanding; no explanation\r\nis sufficient for its comprehension, and there is no power to indicate it.\r\nWhat has an atom of dust to do with the pure world, and what relation is\r\nthere between the limited mind and the infinite world? Minds are powerless\r\nto comprehend God, and the souls become bewildered in explaining Him. \"The\r\neyes see Him not, but He seeth the eyes. He is the Omniscient, the\r\nKnower.\"(120)\r\n\r\nConsequently, with reference to this plane of existence, every statement\r\nand elucidation is defective, all praise and all description are unworthy,\r\nevery conception is vain, and every meditation is futile. But for this\r\nEssence of the essences, this Truth of truths, this Mystery of mysteries,\r\nthere are reflections, auroras, appearances and resplendencies in the\r\nworld of existence. The dawning-place of these splendors, the place of\r\nthese reflections, and the appearance of these manifestations are the Holy\r\nDawning-places, the Universal Realities and the Divine Beings, Who are the\r\ntrue mirrors of the sanctified Essence of God. All the perfections, the\r\nbounties, the splendors which come from God are visible and evident in the\r\nReality of the Holy Manifestations, like the sun which is resplendent in a\r\nclear polished mirror with all its perfections and bounties. If it be said\r\nthat the mirrors are the manifestations of the sun and the dawning-places\r\nof the rising star, this does not mean that the sun has descended from the\r\nheight of its sanctity and become incorporated in the mirror, nor that the\r\nUnlimited Reality is limited to this place of appearance. God forbid! This\r\nis the belief of the adherents of anthropomorphism. No; all the praises,\r\nthe descriptions and exaltations refer to the Holy Manifestations--that is\r\nto say, all the descriptions, the qualities, the names and the attributes\r\nwhich we mention return to the Divine Manifestations; but as no one has\r\nattained to the reality of the Essence of Divinity, so no one is able to\r\ndescribe, explain, praise or glorify it. Therefore, all that the human\r\nreality knows, discovers and understands of the names, the attributes and\r\nthe perfections of God refer to these Holy Manifestations. There is no\r\naccess to anything else: \"the way is closed, and seeking is forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we speak of the names and attributes of the Divine Reality,\r\nand we praise Him by attributing to Him sight, hearing, power, life and\r\nknowledge. We affirm these names and attributes, not to prove the\r\nperfections of God, but to deny that He is capable of imperfections. When\r\nwe look at the existing world, we see that ignorance is imperfection and\r\nknowledge is perfection; therefore, we say that the sanctified Essence of\r\nGod is wisdom. Weakness is imperfection, and power is perfection;\r\nconsequently, we say that the sanctified Essence of God is the acme of\r\npower. It is not that we can comprehend His knowledge, His sight, His\r\npower and life, for it is beyond our comprehension; for the essential\r\nnames and attributes of God are identical with His Essence, and His\r\nEssence is above all comprehension. If the attributes are not identical\r\nwith the Essence, there must also be a multiplicity of preexistences, and\r\ndifferences between the attributes and the Essence must also exist; and as\r\nPreexistence is necessary, therefore, the sequence of preexistences would\r\nbecome infinite. This is an evident error.\r\n\r\nAccordingly all these attributes, names, praises and eulogies apply to the\r\nPlaces of Manifestation; and all that we imagine and suppose beside them\r\nis mere imagination, for we have no means of comprehending that which is\r\ninvisible and inaccessible. This is why it is said: \"All that you have\r\ndistinguished through the illusion of your imagination in your subtle\r\nmental images is but a creation like unto yourself, and returns to\r\nyou.\"(121) It is clear that if we wish to imagine the Reality of Divinity,\r\nthis imagination is the surrounded, and we are the surrounding one; and it\r\nis sure that the one who surrounds is greater than the surrounded. From\r\nthis it is certain and evident that if we imagine a Divine Reality outside\r\nof the Holy Manifestations, it is pure imagination, for there is no way to\r\napproach the Reality of Divinity which is not cut off to us, and all that\r\nwe imagine is mere supposition.\r\n\r\nTherefore, reflect that different peoples of the world are revolving\r\naround imaginations and are worshipers of the idols of thoughts and\r\nconjectures. They are not aware of this; they consider their imaginations\r\nto be the Reality which is withdrawn from all comprehension and purified\r\nfrom all descriptions. They regard themselves as the people of Unity, and\r\nthe others as worshipers of idols; but idols at least have a mineral\r\nexistence, while the idols of thoughts and the imaginations of man are but\r\nfancies; they have not even mineral existence. \"Take heed ye who are\r\nendued with discernment.\"(122)\r\n\r\nKnow that the attributes of perfection, the splendor of the divine\r\nbounties, and the lights of inspiration are visible and evident in all the\r\nHoly Manifestations; but the glorious Word of God, Christ, and the\r\nGreatest Name, Baha'u'llah, are manifestations and evidences which are\r\nbeyond imagination, for They possess all the perfections of the former\r\nManifestations; and more than that, They possess some perfections which\r\nmake the other Manifestations dependent upon Them. So all the Prophets of\r\nIsrael were centers of inspiration; Christ also was a receiver of\r\ninspiration, but what a difference between the inspiration of the Word of\r\nGod and the revelations of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Elijah!\r\n\r\nReflect that light is the expression of the vibrations of the etheric\r\nmatter: the nerves of the eye are affected by these vibrations, and sight\r\nis produced. The light of the lamp exists through the vibration of the\r\netheric matter; so also does that of the sun, but what a difference\r\nbetween the light of the sun and that of the stars or the lamp!\r\n\r\nThe spirit of man appears and is manifest in the embryonic condition, and\r\nalso in that of childhood and of maturity, and it is resplendent and\r\nevident in the condition of perfection. The spirit is one, but in the\r\nembryonic condition the power of sight and of hearing is lacking. In the\r\nstate of maturity and perfection it appears in the utmost splendor and\r\nbrilliance. In the same way the seed in the beginning becomes leaves and\r\nis the place where the vegetable spirit appears; in the condition of fruit\r\nit manifests the same spirit--that is to say, the power of growth appears\r\nin the utmost perfection; but what a difference between the condition of\r\nthe leaves and that of the fruit! For from the fruit a hundred thousand\r\nleaves appear, though they all grow and develop through the same vegetable\r\nspirit. Notice the difference between the virtues and perfections of\r\nChrist, the splendors and brilliance of Baha'u'llah, and the virtues of\r\nthe Prophets of Israel, such as Ezekiel or Samuel. All were the\r\nmanifestations of inspiration, but between them there is an infinite\r\ndifference. Salutations!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38: THE THREE STATIONS OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow that the Holy Manifestations, though They have the degrees of endless\r\nperfections, yet, speaking generally, have only three stations. The first\r\nstation is the physical; the second station is the human, which is that of\r\nthe rational soul; the third is that of the divine appearance and the\r\nheavenly splendor.\r\n\r\nThe physical station is phenomenal; it is composed of elements, and\r\nnecessarily everything that is composed is subject to decomposition. It is\r\nnot possible that a composition should not be disintegrated.\r\n\r\nThe second is the station of the rational soul, which is the human\r\nreality. This also is phenomenal, and the Holy Manifestations share it\r\nwith all mankind.\r\n\r\nKnow that, although the human soul has existed on the earth for prolonged\r\ntimes and ages, yet it is phenomenal. As it is a divine sign, when once it\r\nhas come into existence, it is eternal. The spirit of man has a beginning,\r\nbut it has no end; it continues eternally. In the same way the species\r\nexisting on this earth are phenomenal, for it is established that there\r\nwas a time when these species did not exist on the surface of the earth.\r\nMoreover, the earth has not always existed, but the world of existence has\r\nalways been, for the universe is not limited to this terrestrial globe.\r\nThe meaning of this is that, although human souls are phenomenal, they are\r\nnevertheless immortal, everlasting and perpetual; for the world of things\r\nis the world of imperfection in comparison with that of man, and the world\r\nof man is the world of perfection in comparison with that of things. When\r\nimperfections reach the station of perfection, they become eternal.(123)\r\nThis is an example of which you must comprehend the meaning.\r\n\r\nThe third station is that of the divine appearance and heavenly splendor:\r\nit is the Word of God, the Eternal Bounty, the Holy Spirit. It has neither\r\nbeginning nor end, for these things are related to the world of\r\ncontingencies and not to the divine world. For God the end is the same\r\nthing as the beginning. So the reckoning of days, weeks, months and years,\r\nof yesterday and today, is connected with the terrestrial globe; but in\r\nthe sun there is no such thing--there is neither yesterday, today nor\r\ntomorrow, neither months nor years: all are equal. In the same way the\r\nWord of God is purified from all these conditions and is exempt from the\r\nboundaries, the laws and the limits of the world of contingency.\r\nTherefore, the reality of prophethood, which is the Word of God and the\r\nperfect state of manifestation, did not have any beginning and will not\r\nhave any end; its rising is different from all others and is like that of\r\nthe sun. For example, its dawning in the sign of Christ was with the\r\nutmost splendor and radiance, and this is eternal and everlasting. See how\r\nmany conquering kings there have been, how many statesmen and princes,\r\npowerful organizers, all of whom have disappeared, whereas the breezes of\r\nChrist are still blowing; His light is still shining; His melody is still\r\nresounding; His standard is still waving; His armies are still fighting;\r\nHis heavenly voice is still sweetly melodious; His clouds are still\r\nshowering gems; His lightning is still flashing; His reflection is still\r\nclear and brilliant; His splendor is still radiating and luminous; and it\r\nis the same with those souls who are under His protection and are shining\r\nwith His light.\r\n\r\nThen it is evident that the Manifestations possess three conditions: the\r\nphysical condition, the condition of the rational soul, and the condition\r\nof the divine appearance and heavenly splendor. The physical condition\r\nwill certainly become decomposed, but the condition of the rational soul,\r\nthough it has a beginning, has no end: nay, it is endowed with everlasting\r\nlife. But the Holy Reality, of which Christ says, \"The Father is in the\r\nSon,\"(124) has neither beginning nor end. When beginning is spoken of, it\r\nsignifies the state of manifesting; and, symbolically, the condition of\r\nsilence is compared to sleep. For example, a man is sleeping--when he\r\nbegins to speak, he is awake--but it is always the same individual, whether\r\nhe be asleep or awake; no difference has occurred in his station, his\r\nelevation, his glory, his reality or his nature. The state of silence is\r\ncompared to sleep, and that of manifestation to wakefulness. A man\r\nsleeping or waking is the same man; sleep is one state, and wakefulness is\r\nanother. The time of silence is compared to sleep, and manifestation and\r\nguidance are compared to wakefulness.\r\n\r\nIn the Gospel it is said, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was\r\nwith God.\"(125) Then it is evident and clear that Christ did not reach to\r\nthe station of Messiahship and its perfections at the time of baptism,\r\nwhen the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the likeness of a dove. Nay,\r\nthe Word of God from all eternity has always been, and will be, in the\r\nexaltation of sanctification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39: THE HUMAN CONDITION AND THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF THE DIVINE\r\nMANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe said that the Manifestations have three planes. First, the physical\r\nreality, which depends upon the body; second, the individual reality, that\r\nis to say, the rational soul; third, the divine appearance, which is the\r\ndivine perfections, the cause of the life of existence, of the education\r\nof souls, of the guidance of people, and of the enlightenment of the\r\ncontingent world.\r\n\r\nThe physical state is the human state which perishes because it is\r\ncomposed of elements, and all that is composed of elements will\r\nnecessarily be decomposed and dispersed.\r\n\r\nBut the individual reality of the Manifestations of God is a holy reality,\r\nand for that reason it is sanctified and, in that which concerns its\r\nnature and quality, is distinguished from all other things. It is like the\r\nsun, which by its essential nature produces light and cannot be compared\r\nto the moon, just as the particles that compose the globe of the sun\r\ncannot be compared with those which compose the moon. The particles and\r\norganization of the former produce rays, but the particles of which the\r\nmoon is composed do not produce rays but need to borrow light. So other\r\nhuman realities are those souls who, like the moon, take light from the\r\nsun; but that Holy Reality is luminous in Himself.\r\n\r\nThe third plane of that Being(126) is the Divine Bounty, the splendor of\r\nthe Preexistent Beauty, and the radiance of the light of the Almighty. The\r\nindividual realities of the Divine Manifestations have no separation from\r\nthe Bounty of God and the Lordly Splendor. In the same way, the orb of the\r\nsun has no separation from the light. Therefore, it may be said that the\r\nascension of the Holy Manifestation is simply the leaving of this\r\nelemental form. For example, if a lamp illumines this niche, and if its\r\nlight ceases to illuminate it because the niche is destroyed, the bounty\r\nof the lamp is not cut off. Briefly, in the Holy Manifestations the\r\nPreexistent Bounty is like the light, the individuality is represented by\r\nthe glass globe, and the human body is like the niche: if the niche is\r\ndestroyed, the lamp continues to burn. The Divine Manifestations are so\r\nmany different mirrors because They have a special individuality, but that\r\nwhich is reflected in the mirrors is one sun. It is clear that the reality\r\nof Christ is different from that of Moses.\r\n\r\nVerily, from the beginning that Holy Reality(127) is conscious of the\r\nsecret of existence, and from the age of childhood signs of greatness\r\nappear and are visible in Him. Therefore, how can it be that with all\r\nthese bounties and perfections He should have no consciousness?\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that the Holy Manifestations have three planes. The\r\nphysical condition, the individual reality, and the center of the\r\nappearance of perfection: it is like the sun, its heat and its light.\r\nOther individuals have the physical plane, the plane of the rational\r\nsoul--the spirit and mind.(128) So the saying, \"I was asleep, and the\r\ndivine breezes passed over Me, and I awoke,\" is like Christ's saying, \"The\r\nbody is sad, and the spirit is happy,\" or again, \"I am afflicted,\" or \"I\r\nam at ease,\" or \"I am troubled\"--these refer to the physical condition and\r\nhave no reference to the individual reality nor to the manifestation of\r\nthe Divine Reality. Thus consider what thousands of vicissitudes can\r\nhappen to the body of man, but the spirit is not affected by them; it may\r\neven be that some members of the body are entirely crippled, but the\r\nessence of the mind remains and is everlasting. A thousand accidents may\r\nhappen to a garment, but for the wearer of it there is no danger. These\r\nwords which Baha'u'llah said, \"I was asleep, and the breeze passed over\r\nMe, and awakened Me,\" refer to the body.\r\n\r\nIn the world of God there is no past, no future and no present; all are\r\none. So when Christ said, \"In the beginning was the Word\"(129)--that means\r\nit was, is and shall be; for in the world of God there is no time. Time\r\nhas sway over creatures but not over God. For example, in the prayer He\r\nsays, \"Hallowed be Thy name\"; the meaning is that Thy name was, is and\r\nshall be hallowed.(130) Morning, noon and evening are related to this\r\nearth, but in the sun there is neither morning, noon nor evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40: THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--One of the powers possessed by the Divine Manifestations is\r\nknowledge. To what extent is it limited?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Knowledge is of two kinds. One is subjective and the other\r\nobjective knowledge--that is to say, an intuitive knowledge and a knowledge\r\nderived from perception.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of things which men universally have is gained by reflection\r\nor by evidence--that is to say, either by the power of the mind the\r\nconception of an object is formed, or from beholding an object the form is\r\nproduced in the mirror of the heart. The circle of this knowledge is very\r\nlimited because it depends upon effort and attainment.\r\n\r\nBut the second sort of knowledge, which is the knowledge of being, is\r\nintuitive; it is like the cognizance and consciousness that man has of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nFor example, the mind and the spirit of man are cognizant of the\r\nconditions and states of the members and component parts of the body, and\r\nare aware of all the physical sensations; in the same way, they are aware\r\nof their power, of their feelings, and of their spiritual conditions. This\r\nis the knowledge of being which man realizes and perceives, for the spirit\r\nsurrounds the body and is aware of its sensations and powers. This\r\nknowledge is not the outcome of effort and study. It is an existing thing;\r\nit is an absolute gift.\r\n\r\nSince the Sanctified Realities, the supreme Manifestations of God,\r\nsurround the essence and qualities of the creatures, transcend and contain\r\nexisting realities and understand all things, therefore, Their knowledge\r\nis divine knowledge, and not acquired--that is to say, it is a holy bounty;\r\nit is a divine revelation.\r\n\r\nWe will mention an example expressly for the purpose of comprehending this\r\nsubject. The most noble being on the earth is man. He embraces the animal,\r\nvegetable and mineral kingdoms--that is to say, these conditions are\r\ncontained in him to such an extent that he is the possessor of these\r\nconditions and states; he is aware of their mysteries and of the secrets\r\nof their existence. This is simply an example and not an analogy. Briefly,\r\nthe supreme Manifestations of God are aware of the reality of the\r\nmysteries of beings. Therefore, They establish laws which are suitable and\r\nadapted to the state of the world of man, for religion is the essential\r\nconnection which proceeds from the realities of things. The\r\nManifestation--that is, the Holy Lawgiver--unless He is aware of the\r\nrealities of beings, will not comprehend the essential connection which\r\nproceeds from the realities of things, and He will certainly not be able\r\nto establish a religion conformable to the facts and suited to the\r\nconditions. The Prophets of God, the supreme Manifestations, are like\r\nskilled physicians, and the contingent world is like the body of man: the\r\ndivine laws are the remedy and treatment. Consequently, the doctor must be\r\naware of, and know, all the members and parts, as well as the constitution\r\nand state of the patient, so that he can prescribe a medicine which will\r\nbe beneficial against the violent poison of the disease. In reality the\r\ndoctor deduces from the disease itself the treatment which is suited to\r\nthe patient, for he diagnoses the malady, and afterward prescribes the\r\nremedy for the illness. Until the malady be discovered, how can the remedy\r\nand treatment be prescribed? The doctor then must have a thorough\r\nknowledge of the constitution, members, organs and state of the patient,\r\nand be acquainted with all diseases and all remedies, in order to\r\nprescribe a fitting medicine.\r\n\r\nReligion, then, is the necessary connection which emanates from the\r\nreality of things; and as the supreme Manifestations of God are aware of\r\nthe mysteries of beings, therefore, They understand this essential\r\nconnection, and by this knowledge establish the Law of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41: THE UNIVERSAL CYCLES\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the real explanation of the cycles which occur in the\r\nworld of existence?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Each one of the luminous bodies in this limitless firmament has a\r\ncycle of revolution which is of a different duration, and every one\r\nrevolves in its own orbit, and again begins a new cycle. So the earth,\r\nevery three hundred and sixty-five days, five hours, forty-eight minutes\r\nand a fraction, completes a revolution; and then it begins a new\r\ncycle--that is to say, the first cycle is again renewed. In the same way,\r\nfor the whole universe, whether for the heavens or for men, there are\r\ncycles of great events, of important facts and occurrences. When a cycle\r\nis ended, a new cycle begins; and the old one, on account of the great\r\nevents which take place, is completely forgotten, and not a trace or\r\nrecord of it will remain. As you see, we have no records of twenty\r\nthousand years ago, although we have before proved by argument that life\r\non this earth is very ancient. It is not one hundred thousand, or two\r\nhundred thousand, or one million or two million years old; it is very\r\nancient, and the ancient records and traces are entirely obliterated.\r\n\r\nEach of the Divine Manifestations has likewise a cycle, and during the\r\ncycle His laws and commandments prevail and are performed. When His cycle\r\nis completed by the appearance of a new Manifestation, a new cycle begins.\r\nIn this way cycles begin, end and are renewed, until a universal cycle is\r\ncompleted in the world, when important events and great occurrences will\r\ntake place which entirely efface every trace and every record of the past;\r\nthen a new universal cycle begins in the world, for this universe has no\r\nbeginning. We have before stated proofs and evidences concerning this\r\nsubject; there is no need of repetition.\r\n\r\nBriefly, we say a universal cycle in the world of existence signifies a\r\nlong duration of time, and innumerable and incalculable periods and\r\nepochs. In such a cycle the Manifestations appear with splendor in the\r\nrealm of the visible until a great and supreme Manifestation makes the\r\nworld the center of His radiance. His appearance causes the world to\r\nattain to maturity, and the extension of His cycle is very great.\r\nAfterward, other Manifestations will arise under His shadow, Who according\r\nto the needs of the time will renew certain commandments relating to\r\nmaterial questions and affairs, while remaining under His shadow.\r\n\r\nWe are in the cycle which began with Adam, and its supreme Manifestation\r\nis Baha'u'llah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42: THE POWER AND INFLUENCE OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the degree of the power and the perfections of the\r\nThrones of Reality, the Manifestations of God, and what is the limit of\r\nTheir influence?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Consider the world of existence--that is to say, the world of\r\nmaterial things. The solar system is dark and obscure, and in it the sun\r\nis the center of light, and all the planets of the system revolve around\r\nits might and are partakers of its bounty. The sun is the cause of life\r\nand illumination, and the means of the growth and development of all the\r\nbeings of the solar system; for without the bounty of the sun no living\r\nbeing could exist: all would be dark and destroyed. Therefore, it is\r\nevident and clear that the sun is the center of light and the cause of the\r\nlife of the beings of the solar system.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the Holy Manifestations of God are the centers of the\r\nlight of reality, of the source of mysteries, and of the bounties of love.\r\nThey are resplendent in the world of hearts and thoughts, and shower\r\neternal graces upon the world of spirits; They give spiritual life and are\r\nshining with the light of realities and meanings. The enlightenment of the\r\nworld of thought comes from these centers of light and sources of\r\nmysteries. Without the bounty of the splendor and the instructions of\r\nthese Holy Beings the world of souls and thoughts would be opaque\r\ndarkness. Without the irrefutable teachings of those sources of mysteries\r\nthe human world would become the pasture of animal appetites and\r\nqualities, the existence of everything would be unreal, and there would be\r\nno true life. That is why it is said in the Gospel: \"In the beginning was\r\nthe Word,\" meaning that it became the cause of all life.(131)\r\n\r\nNow consider the influence of the sun upon the earthly beings, what signs\r\nand results become evident and clear from its nearness and remoteness,\r\nfrom its rising or its setting. At one time it is autumn, at another time\r\nspring; or again it is summer or winter. When the sun passes the line of\r\nthe equator, the life-giving spring will become manifest in splendor, and\r\nwhen it is in the summer solstice, the fruits will attain to the acme of\r\nperfection, grains and plants will yield their produce, and earthly beings\r\nwill attain their most complete development and growth.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, when the Holy Manifestation of God, Who is the sun of the\r\nworld of His creation, shines upon the worlds of spirits, of thoughts and\r\nof hearts, then the spiritual spring and new life appear, the power of the\r\nwonderful springtime becomes visible, and marvelous benefits are apparent.\r\nAs you have observed, at the time of the appearance of each Manifestation\r\nof God extraordinary progress has occurred in the world of minds, thoughts\r\nand spirits. For example, in this divine age see what development has been\r\nattained in the world of minds and thoughts, and it is now only the\r\nbeginning of its dawn. Before long you will see that new bounties and\r\ndivine teachings will illuminate this dark world and will transform these\r\nsad regions into the paradise of Eden.\r\n\r\nIf we were to explain the signs and bounties of each of the Holy\r\nManifestations, it would take too long. Think and reflect upon it\r\nyourself, and then you will attain to the truth of this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43: THE TWO CLASSES OF PROPHETS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--How many kinds of Prophets are there?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Universally, the Prophets are of two kinds. One are the\r\nindependent Prophets Who are followed; the other kind are not independent\r\nand are themselves followers.\r\n\r\nThe independent Prophets are the lawgivers and the founders of a new\r\ncycle. Through Their appearance the world puts on a new garment, the\r\nfoundations of religion are established, and a new book is revealed.\r\nWithout an intermediary They receive bounty from the Reality of the\r\nDivinity, and Their illumination is an essential illumination. They are\r\nlike the sun which is luminous in itself: the light is its essential\r\nnecessity; it does not receive light from any other star. These\r\nDawning-places of the morn of Unity are the sources of bounty and the\r\nmirrors of the Essence of Reality.\r\n\r\nThe other Prophets are followers and promoters, for they are branches and\r\nnot independent; they receive the bounty of the independent Prophets, and\r\nthey profit by the light of the Guidance of the universal Prophets. They\r\nare like the moon, which is not luminous and radiant in itself, but\r\nreceives its light from the sun.\r\n\r\nThe Manifestations of universal Prophethood Who appeared independently\r\nare, for example, Abraham, Moses, Christ, Muhammad, the Bab and\r\nBaha'u'llah. But the others who are followers and promoters are like\r\nSolomon, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. For the independent Prophets\r\nare founders; They establish a new religion and make new creatures of men;\r\nThey change the general morals, promote new customs and rules, renew the\r\ncycle and the Law. Their appearance is like the season of spring, which\r\narrays all earthly beings in a new garment, and gives them a new life.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second sort of Prophets who are followers, these also\r\npromote the Law of God, make known the Religion of God, and proclaim His\r\nword. Of themselves they have no power and might, except what they receive\r\nfrom the independent Prophets.\r\n\r\nQuestion.--To which category do Buddha and Confucius belong?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Buddha also established a new religion, and Confucius renewed\r\nmorals and ancient virtues, but their institutions have been entirely\r\ndestroyed. The beliefs and rites of the Buddhists and Confucianists have\r\nnot continued in accordance with their fundamental teachings. The founder\r\nof Buddhism was a wonderful soul. He established the Oneness of God, but\r\nlater the original principles of His doctrines gradually disappeared, and\r\nignorant customs and ceremonials arose and increased until they finally\r\nended in the worship of statues and images.\r\n\r\nNow, consider: Christ frequently repeated that the Ten Commandments in the\r\nPentateuch were to be followed, and He insisted that they should be\r\nmaintained. Among the Ten Commandments is one which says: \"Do not worship\r\nany picture or image.\"(132) At present in some of the Christian churches\r\nmany pictures and images exist. It is, therefore, clear and evident that\r\nthe Religion of God does not maintain its original principles among the\r\npeople, but that it has gradually changed and altered until it has been\r\nentirely destroyed and annihilated. Because of this the manifestation is\r\nrenewed, and a new religion established. But if religions did not change\r\nand alter, there would be no need of renewal.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the tree was in all its beauty, and full of blossoms and\r\nfruits, but at last it became old and entirely fruitless, and it withered\r\nand decayed. This is why the True Gardener plants again an incomparable\r\nyoung tree of the same kind and species, which grows and develops day by\r\nday, and spreads a wide shadow in the divine garden, and yields admirable\r\nfruit. So it is with religions; through the passing of time they change\r\nfrom their original foundation, the truth of the Religion of God entirely\r\ndeparts, and the spirit of it does not stay; heresies appear, and it\r\nbecomes a body without a soul. That is why it is renewed.\r\n\r\nThe meaning is that the Buddhists and Confucianists now worship images and\r\nstatues. They are entirely heedless of the Oneness of God and believe in\r\nimaginary gods like the ancient Greeks. But in the beginning it was not\r\nso; there were different principles and other ordinances.\r\n\r\nAgain, consider how much the principles of the religion of Christ have\r\nbeen forgotten, and how many heresies have appeared. For example, Christ\r\nforbade revenge and transgression; furthermore, He commanded benevolence\r\nand mercy in return for injury and evil. Now reflect: among the Christian\r\nnations themselves how many sanguinary wars have taken place, and how much\r\noppression, cruelty, rapacity and bloodthirstiness have occurred! Many of\r\nthese wars were carried on by command of the Popes. It is then clear and\r\nevident that in the passage of time religions become entirely changed and\r\naltered. Therefore, they are renewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44: EXPLANATION OF THE REBUKES ADDRESSED BY GOD TO THE PROPHETS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--In the Holy Books there are some addresses of reproach and\r\nrebuke directed to the Prophets. Who is addressed, and for whom is the\r\nrebuke?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--All the divine discourses containing reproof, though apparently\r\naddressed to the Prophets, in reality are directed to the people, through\r\na wisdom which is absolute mercy, in order that the people may not be\r\ndiscouraged and disheartened. They, therefore, appear to be addressed to\r\nthe Prophets; but though outwardly for the Prophets, they are in truth for\r\nthe people and not for the Prophets.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the powerful and independent king represents his country: that\r\nwhich he says is the word of all, and every agreement that he makes is the\r\nagreement of all, for the wishes and desires of all his subjects are\r\nincluded in his wishes and desires. In the same way, every Prophet is the\r\nexpression of the whole of the people. So the promise and speech of God\r\naddressed to Him is addressed to all. Generally the speech of reproach and\r\nrebuke is rather too severe for the people and would be heartbreaking to\r\nthem. So the Perfect Wisdom makes use of this form of address, as is\r\nclearly shown in the Bible itself, as, for example, when the children of\r\nIsrael rebelled and said to Moses: \"We cannot fight with the Amalekites,\r\nfor they are powerful, mighty and courageous.\" God then rebuked Moses and\r\nAaron, though Moses was in complete obedience and not in rebellion. Surely\r\nsuch a great Man, Who is the mediator of the Divine Bounty and the\r\ndeliverer of the Law, must necessarily obey the commands of God. These\r\nHoly Souls are like the leaves of a tree which are put in motion by the\r\nblowing of the wind, and not by Their own desire; for They are attracted\r\nby the breeze of the love of God, and Their will is absolutely submissive.\r\nTheir word is the word of God; Their commandment is the commandment of\r\nGod; Their prohibition is the prohibition of God. They are like the glass\r\nglobe which receives light from the lamp. Although the light appears to\r\nemanate from the glass, in reality it is shining from the lamp. In the\r\nsame way for the Prophets of God, the centers of manifestation, Their\r\nmovement and repose come from divine inspiration, not from human passions.\r\nIf it were not so, how could the Prophet be worthy of trust, and how could\r\nHe be the Messenger of God, delivering the commands and the prohibitions\r\nof God? All the defects that are mentioned in the Holy Books with\r\nreference to the Manifestations refer to questions of this kind.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God that you have come here and have met the servants of God!\r\nHave you perceived in them anything except the fragrance of the pleasure\r\nof God? Indeed, no. You have seen with your own eyes that day and night\r\nthey endeavor and strive, and that they have no aim except the exaltation\r\nof the word of God, the education of men, the improvement of the masses,\r\nspiritual progress, the promulgation of universal peace, goodwill to all\r\nmankind, and kindness toward all nations. Sacrificing themselves for the\r\ngood of humanity, they are detached from material advantages, and labor to\r\ngive virtues to mankind.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to our subject. For example, in the Old Testament it is\r\nsaid in the Book of Isaiah, chapter 48, verse 12: \"Hearken unto Me, O\r\nJacob and Israel, My called; I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.\"\r\nIt is evident that it does not mean Jacob who was Israel, but the people\r\nof Israel. Also in the Book of Isaiah, chapter 43, verse 1, it is said:\r\n\"But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and He that\r\nformed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called\r\nthee by thy name; thou art Mine.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in Numbers, chapter 20, verse 23: \"And the Lord spake unto\r\nMoses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,\r\nAaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the\r\nland which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled\r\nagainst My word at the water of Meribah\";(133) and in verse 13: \"This is\r\nthe water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the Lord,\r\nand He was sanctified in them.\"\r\n\r\nObserve: the people of Israel rebelled, but apparently the reproach was\r\nfor Moses and Aaron. As it is said in the Book of Deuteronomy, chapter 3,\r\nverse 26: \"But the Lord was wroth with Me for your sakes, and would not\r\nhear Me: and the Lord said unto Me, Let it suffice Thee; speak no more\r\nunto Me of this matter.\"\r\n\r\nNow this discourse and reproach really refer to the children of Israel,\r\nwho, for having rebelled against the command of God, were held captive a\r\nlong time in the arid desert, on the other side of Jordan, until the time\r\nof Joshua--upon him be salutations. This address and reproach appeared to\r\nbe for Moses and Aaron, but in reality they were for the people of Israel.\r\n\r\nIn the same way in the Qur'an it is said to Muhammad: \"We have granted\r\nThee a manifest victory, so that God may forgive Thee Thy preceding and\r\nsubsequent sin.\"(134) This address, although apparently directed to\r\nMuhammad, was in reality for all the people. This mode of address, as\r\nbefore said, was used by the perfect wisdom of God, so that the hearts of\r\nthe people might not be troubled, anxious and tormented.\r\n\r\nHow often the Prophets of God and His supreme Manifestations in Their\r\nprayers confess Their sins and faults! This is only to teach other men, to\r\nencourage and incite them to humility and meekness, and to induce them to\r\nconfess their sins and faults. For these Holy Souls are pure from every\r\nsin and sanctified from faults. In the Gospel it is said that a man came\r\nto Christ and called Him \"Good Master.\" Christ answered, \"Why callest thou\r\nMe good? there is none good but One, that is, God.\"(135) This did not\r\nmean--God forbid!--that Christ was a sinner; but the intention was to teach\r\nsubmission, humility, meekness and modesty to the man to whom He spoke.\r\nThese Holy Beings are lights, and light does not unite itself with\r\ndarkness. They are life, and life and death are not confounded. They are\r\nfor guidance, and guidance and error cannot be together. They are the\r\nessence of obedience, and obedience cannot exist with rebellion.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the addresses in the form of reproach which are in the Holy\r\nBooks, though apparently directed to the Prophets--that is to say, to the\r\nManifestations of God--in reality are intended for the people. This will\r\nbecome evident and clear to you when you have diligently examined the Holy\r\nBooks.\r\n\r\nSalutations be upon you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45: EXPLANATION OF THE VERSE OF THE KITAB-I-AQDAS, \"THERE IS NO PARTNER\r\nFOR HIM WHO IS THE DAYSPRING OF REVELATION IN HIS MOST GREAT\r\nINFALLIBILITY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said in the holy verse: \"There is no partner for Him Who is the\r\nDayspring of Revelation(136) in His Most Great Infallibility. He is, in\r\ntruth, the exponent of 'God doeth whatsoever He willeth' in the kingdom of\r\ncreation. Indeed the Almighty hath exclusively reserved this station for\r\nHimself and to none is given a share in this sublime and highly exalted\r\ndistinction.\"(137)\r\n\r\nKnow that infallibility is of two kinds: essential infallibility and\r\nacquired infallibility. In like manner there is essential knowledge and\r\nacquired knowledge; and so it is with other names and attributes.\r\nEssential infallibility is peculiar to the supreme Manifestation, for it\r\nis His essential requirement, and an essential requirement cannot be\r\nseparated from the thing itself. The rays are the essential necessity of\r\nthe sun and are inseparable from it. Knowledge is an essential necessity\r\nof God and is inseparable from Him. Power is an essential necessity of God\r\nand is inseparable from Him. If it could be separated from Him, He would\r\nnot be God. If the rays could be separated from the sun, it would not be\r\nthe sun. Therefore, if one imagines separation of the Most Great\r\nInfallibility from the supreme Manifestation, He would not be the supreme\r\nManifestation, and He would lack the essential perfections.\r\n\r\nBut acquired infallibility is not a natural necessity; on the contrary, it\r\nis a ray of the bounty of infallibility which shines from the Sun of\r\nReality upon hearts, and grants a share and portion of itself to souls.\r\nAlthough these souls have not essential infallibility, still they are\r\nunder the protection of God--that is to say, God preserves them from error.\r\nThus many of the holy beings who were not dawning-points of the Most Great\r\nInfallibility, were yet kept and preserved from error under the shadow of\r\nthe protection and guardianship of God, for they were the mediators of\r\ngrace between God and men. If God did not protect them from error, their\r\nerror would cause believing souls to fall into error, and thus the\r\nfoundation of the Religion of God would be overturned, which would not be\r\nfitting nor worthy of God.\r\n\r\nTo epitomize: essential infallibility belongs especially to the supreme\r\nManifestations, and acquired infallibility is granted to every holy soul.\r\nFor instance, the Universal House of Justice,(138) if it be established\r\nunder the necessary conditions--with members elected from all the\r\npeople--that House of Justice will be under the protection and the unerring\r\nguidance of God. If that House of Justice shall decide unanimously, or by\r\na majority, upon any question not mentioned in the Book, that decision and\r\ncommand will be guarded from mistake. Now the members of the House of\r\nJustice have not, individually, essential infallibility; but the body of\r\nthe House of Justice is under the protection and unerring guidance of God:\r\nthis is called conferred infallibility.\r\n\r\nBriefly, it is said that the \"Dayspring of Revelation\" is the\r\nmanifestation of these words, \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\"; this\r\ncondition is peculiar to that Holy Being, and others have no share of this\r\nessential perfection. That is to say, that as the supreme Manifestations\r\ncertainly possess essential infallibility, therefore whatever emanates\r\nfrom Them is identical with the truth, and conformable to reality. They\r\nare not under the shadow of the former laws. Whatever They say is the word\r\nof God, and whatever They perform is an upright action. No believer has\r\nany right to criticize; his condition must be one of absolute submission,\r\nfor the Manifestation arises with perfect wisdom--so that whatever the\r\nsupreme Manifestation says and does is absolute wisdom, and is in\r\naccordance with reality.\r\n\r\nIf some people do not understand the hidden secret of one of His commands\r\nand actions, they ought not to oppose it, for the supreme Manifestation\r\ndoes what He wishes. How often it has occurred, when an act has been\r\nperformed by a wise, perfect, intelligent man, that others incapable of\r\ncomprehending its wisdom have objected to it and been amazed that this\r\nwise man could say or do such a thing. This opposition comes from their\r\nignorance, and the wisdom of the sage is pure and exempt from error. In\r\nthe same way, the skilled doctor in treating the patient does what he\r\nwishes, and the patient has no right to object; whatever the doctor says\r\nand does is right; all ought to consider him the manifestation of these\r\nwords, \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth, and commandeth whatever He\r\ndesireth.\" It is certain that the doctor will use some medicine contrary\r\nto the ideas of other people; now opposition is not permitted to those who\r\nhave not the advantage of science and the medical art. No, in the name of\r\nGod! on the contrary, all ought to be submissive and to perform whatever\r\nthe skilled doctor says. Therefore, the skilled doctor does what he\r\nwishes, and the patients have no share in this right. The skill of the\r\ndoctor must be first ascertained; but when the skill of the doctor is once\r\nestablished, he does what he wishes.\r\n\r\nSo also, when the head of the army is unrivaled in the art of war, in what\r\nhe says and commands he does what he wishes. When the captain of a ship is\r\nproficient in the art of navigation, in whatever he says and commands he\r\ndoes what he wishes. And as the real educator is the Perfect Man, in\r\nwhatever He says and commands He does what He wishes.\r\n\r\nIn short, the meaning of \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\" is that if the\r\nManifestation says something, or gives a command, or performs an action,\r\nand believers do not understand its wisdom, they still ought not to oppose\r\nit by a single thought, seeking to know why He spoke so, or why He did\r\nsuch a thing. The other souls who are under the shadow of the supreme\r\nManifestations are submissive to the commandments of the Law of God, and\r\nare not to deviate as much as a hairsbreadth from it; they must conform\r\ntheir acts and words to the Law of God. If they do deviate from it, they\r\nwill be held responsible and reproved in the presence of God. It is\r\ncertain that they have no share in the permission \"He doeth whatsoever He\r\nwilleth,\" for this condition is peculiar to the supreme Manifestations.\r\n\r\nSo Christ--may my spirit be sacrificed to Him!--was the manifestation of\r\nthese words, \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth,\" but the disciples were not\r\npartakers of this condition; for as they were under the shadow of Christ,\r\nthey could not deviate from His command and will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR: ON THE ORIGIN, POWERS AND CONDITIONS OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46: MODIFICATION OF SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the question of the modification of species and of\r\norganic development--that is to say, to the point of inquiring whether\r\nman's descent is from the animal.\r\n\r\nThis theory has found credence in the minds of some European philosophers,\r\nand it is now very difficult to make its falseness understood, but in the\r\nfuture it will become evident and clear, and the European philosophers\r\nwill themselves realize its untruth. For, verily, it is an evident error.\r\nWhen man looks at the beings with a penetrating regard, and attentively\r\nexamines the condition of existences, and when he sees the state, the\r\norganization and the perfection of the world, he will be convinced that in\r\nthe possible world there is nothing more wonderful than that which already\r\nexists. For all existing beings, terrestrial and celestial, as well as\r\nthis limitless space and all that is in it, have been created and\r\norganized, composed, arranged and perfected as they ought to be; the\r\nuniverse has no imperfection, so that if all beings became pure\r\nintelligence and reflected for ever and ever, it is impossible that they\r\ncould imagine anything better than that which exists.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the creation in the past had not been adorned with utmost\r\nperfection, then existence would have been imperfect and meaningless, and\r\nin this case creation would have been incomplete. This question needs to\r\nbe considered with the greatest attention and thought. For example,\r\nimagine that the contingent world resembles in a general way the body of\r\nman. If this composition, organization, perfection, beauty and\r\ncompleteness which now exist in the human body were different, it would be\r\nabsolute imperfection. Now, if we imagine a time when man belonged to the\r\nanimal world, or when he was merely an animal, we shall find that\r\nexistence would have been imperfect--that is to say, there would have been\r\nno man, and this chief member, which in the body of the world is like the\r\nbrain and mind in man, would have been missing. The world would then have\r\nbeen quite imperfect. It is thus proved that if there had been a time when\r\nman was in the animal kingdom, the perfection of existence would have been\r\ndestroyed; for man is the greatest member of this world, and if the body\r\nwas without this chief member, surely it would be imperfect. We consider\r\nman as the greatest member because, among the creatures, he is the sum of\r\nall existing perfections. When we speak of man, we mean the perfect one,\r\nthe foremost individual in the world, who is the sum of spiritual and\r\napparent perfections, and who is like the sun among the beings. Then\r\nimagine that at one time the sun did not exist, but that it was a planet;\r\nsurely at such a time the relations of existence would be disordered. How\r\ncan such a thing be imagined? To a man who examines the world of existence\r\nwhat we have said is sufficient.\r\n\r\nThere is another more subtle proof: all these endless beings which inhabit\r\nthe world, whether man, animal, vegetable, mineral--whatever they may\r\nbe--are surely, each one of them, composed of elements. There is no doubt\r\nthat this perfection which is in all beings is caused by the creation of\r\nGod from the composing elements, by their appropriate mingling and\r\nproportionate quantities, the mode of their composition, and the influence\r\nof other beings. For all beings are connected together like a chain; and\r\nreciprocal help, assistance and interaction belonging to the properties of\r\nthings are the causes of the existence, development and growth of created\r\nbeings. It is confirmed through evidences and proofs that every being\r\nuniversally acts upon other beings, either absolutely or through\r\nassociation. Finally, the perfection of each individual being--that is to\r\nsay, the perfection which you now see in man or apart from him, with\r\nregard to their atoms, members or powers--is due to the composition of the\r\nelements, to their measure, to their balance, to the mode of their\r\ncombination, and to mutual influence. When all these are gathered\r\ntogether, then man exists.\r\n\r\nAs the perfection of man is entirely due to the composition of the atoms\r\nof the elements, to their measure, to the method of their combination, and\r\nto the mutual influence and action of the different beings--then, since man\r\nwas produced ten or a hundred thousand years ago from these earthly\r\nelements with the same measure and balance, the same method of combination\r\nand mingling, and the same influence of the other beings, exactly the same\r\nman existed then as now. This is evident and not worth debating. A\r\nthousand million years hence, if these elements of man are gathered\r\ntogether and arranged in this special proportion, and if the elements are\r\ncombined according to the same method, and if they are affected by the\r\nsame influence of other beings, exactly the same man will exist. For\r\nexample, if after a hundred thousand years there is oil, fire, a wick, a\r\nlamp and the lighter of the lamp--briefly, if there are all the necessaries\r\nwhich now exist, exactly the same lamp will be obtained.\r\n\r\nThese are conclusive and evident facts. But the arguments which these\r\nEuropean philosophers have used raise doubtful proofs and are not\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47: THE UNIVERSE IS WITHOUT BEGINNING; THE ORIGIN OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow that it is one of the most abstruse spiritual truths that the world\r\nof existence--that is to say, this endless universe--has no beginning.\r\n\r\nWe have already explained that the names and attributes of the Divinity\r\nthemselves require the existence of beings. Although this subject has been\r\nexplained in detail, we will speak of it again briefly. Know that an\r\neducator without pupils cannot be imagined; a monarch without subjects\r\ncould not exist; a master without scholars cannot be appointed; a creator\r\nwithout a creature is impossible; a provider without those provided for\r\ncannot be conceived; for all the divine names and attributes demand the\r\nexistence of beings. If we could imagine a time when no beings existed,\r\nthis imagination would be the denial of the Divinity of God. Moreover,\r\nabsolute nonexistence cannot become existence. If the beings were\r\nabsolutely nonexistent, existence would not have come into being.\r\nTherefore, as the Essence of Unity (that is, the existence of God) is\r\neverlasting and eternal--that is to say, it has neither beginning nor\r\nend--it is certain that this world of existence, this endless universe, has\r\nneither beginning nor end. Yes, it may be that one of the parts of the\r\nuniverse, one of the globes, for example, may come into existence, or may\r\nbe disintegrated, but the other endless globes are still existing; the\r\nuniverse would not be disordered nor destroyed. On the contrary, existence\r\nis eternal and perpetual. As each globe has a beginning, necessarily it\r\nhas an end because every composition, collective or particular, must of\r\nnecessity be decomposed. The only difference is that some are quickly\r\ndecomposed, and others more slowly, but it is impossible that a composed\r\nthing should not eventually be decomposed.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, that we should know what each of the important\r\nexistences was in the beginning--for there is no doubt that in the\r\nbeginning the origin was one: the origin of all numbers is one and not\r\ntwo. Then it is evident that in the beginning matter was one, and that one\r\nmatter appeared in different aspects in each element. Thus various forms\r\nwere produced, and these various aspects as they were produced became\r\npermanent, and each element was specialized. But this permanence was not\r\ndefinite, and did not attain realization and perfect existence until after\r\na very long time. Then these elements became composed, and organized and\r\ncombined in infinite forms; or rather from the composition and combination\r\nof these elements innumerable beings appeared.\r\n\r\nThis composition and arrangement, through the wisdom of God and His\r\npreexistent might, were produced from one natural organization, which was\r\ncomposed and combined with the greatest strength, conformable to wisdom,\r\nand according to a universal law. From this it is evident that it is the\r\ncreation of God, and is not a fortuitous composition and arrangement. This\r\nis why from every natural composition a being can come into existence, but\r\nfrom an accidental composition no being can come into existence. For\r\nexample, if a man of his own mind and intelligence collects some elements\r\nand combines them, a living being will not be brought into existence since\r\nthe system is unnatural. This is the answer to the implied question that,\r\nsince beings are made by the composition and the combination of elements,\r\nwhy is it not possible for us to gather elements and mingle them together,\r\nand so create a living being. This is a false supposition, for the origin\r\nof this composition is from God; it is God Who makes the combination, and\r\nas it is done according to the natural system, from each composition one\r\nbeing is produced, and an existence is realized. A composition made by man\r\nproduces nothing because man cannot create.\r\n\r\nBriefly, we have said that from the composition and combination of\r\nelements, from their decomposition, from their measure, and from the\r\neffect of other beings upon them, resulted forms, endless realities and\r\ninnumerable beings. But it is clear that this terrestrial globe in its\r\npresent form did not come into existence all at once, but that this\r\nuniversal existence gradually passed through different phases until it\r\nbecame adorned with its present perfection. Universal beings resemble and\r\ncan be compared to particular beings, for both are subjected to one\r\nnatural system, one universal law and divine organization. So you will\r\nfind the smallest atoms in the universal system are similar to the\r\ngreatest beings of the universe. It is clear that they come into existence\r\nfrom one laboratory of might under one natural system and one universal\r\nlaw; therefore, they may be compared to one another. Thus the embryo of\r\nman in the womb of the mother gradually grows and develops, and appears in\r\ndifferent forms and conditions, until in the degree of perfect beauty it\r\nreaches maturity and appears in a perfect form with the utmost grace. And\r\nin the same way, the seed of this flower which you see was in the\r\nbeginning an insignificant thing, and very small; and it grew and\r\ndeveloped in the womb of the earth and, after appearing in various forms,\r\ncame forth in this condition with perfect freshness and grace. In the same\r\nmanner, it is evident that this terrestrial globe, having once found\r\nexistence, grew and developed in the matrix of the universe, and came\r\nforth in different forms and conditions, until gradually it attained this\r\npresent perfection, and became adorned with innumerable beings, and\r\nappeared as a finished organization.\r\n\r\nThen it is clear that original matter, which is in the embryonic state,\r\nand the mingled and composed elements which were its earliest forms,\r\ngradually grew and developed during many ages and cycles, passing from one\r\nshape and form to another, until they appeared in this perfection, this\r\nsystem, this organization and this establishment, through the supreme\r\nwisdom of God.\r\n\r\nLet us return to our subject that man, in the beginning of his existence\r\nand in the womb of the earth, like the embryo in the womb of the mother,\r\ngradually grew and developed, and passed from one form to another, from\r\none shape to another, until he appeared with this beauty and perfection,\r\nthis force and this power. It is certain that in the beginning he had not\r\nthis loveliness and grace and elegance, and that he only by degrees\r\nattained this shape, this form, this beauty and this grace. There is no\r\ndoubt that the human embryo did not at once appear in this form; neither\r\ndid it then become the manifestation of the words \"Blessed, therefore, be\r\nGod, the most excellent of Makers.\"(139) Gradually it passed through\r\nvarious conditions and different shapes, until it attained this form and\r\nbeauty, this perfection, grace and loveliness. Thus it is evident and\r\nconfirmed that the development and growth of man on this earth, until he\r\nreached his present perfection, resembled the growth and development of\r\nthe embryo in the womb of the mother: by degrees it passed from condition\r\nto condition, from form to form, from one shape to another, for this is\r\naccording to the requirement of the universal system and Divine Law.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the embryo passes through different states and traverses\r\nnumerous degrees, until it reaches the form in which it manifests the\r\nwords \"Praise be to God, the best of Creators,\" and until the signs of\r\nreason and maturity appear. And in the same way, man's existence on this\r\nearth, from the beginning until it reaches this state, form and condition,\r\nnecessarily lasts a long time, and goes through many degrees until it\r\nreaches this condition. But from the beginning of man's existence he is a\r\ndistinct species. In the same way, the embryo of man in the womb of the\r\nmother was at first in a strange form; then this body passes from shape to\r\nshape, from state to state, from form to form, until it appears in utmost\r\nbeauty and perfection. But even when in the womb of the mother and in this\r\nstrange form, entirely different from his present form and figure, he is\r\nthe embryo of the superior species, and not of the animal; his species and\r\nessence undergo no change. Now, admitting that the traces of organs which\r\nhave disappeared actually exist, this is not a proof of the impermanence\r\nand the nonoriginality of the species. At the most it proves that the\r\nform, and fashion, and the organs of man have progressed. Man was always a\r\ndistinct species, a man, not an animal. So, if the embryo of man in the\r\nwomb of the mother passes from one form to another so that the second form\r\nin no way resembles the first, is this a proof that the species has\r\nchanged? that it was at first an animal, and that its organs progressed\r\nand developed until it became a man? No, indeed! How puerile and unfounded\r\nis this idea and this thought! For the proof of the originality of the\r\nhuman species, and of the permanency of the nature of man, is clear and\r\nevident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48: THE DIFFERENCE EXISTING BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready we have talked once or twice on the subject of the spirit, but our\r\nwords have not been written down.\r\n\r\nKnow that people belong to two categories--that is to say, they constitute\r\ntwo parties. One party deny the spirit and say that man also is a species\r\nof animal; for they say: Do we not see that animals and men share the same\r\npowers and senses? These simple, single elements which fill space are\r\nendlessly combined, and from each of these combinations one of the beings\r\nis produced. Among these beings is the possessor of spirit,(140) of the\r\npowers and of the senses. The more perfect the combination, the nobler is\r\nthe being. The combination of the elements in the body of man is more\r\nperfect than the composition of any other being; it is mingled in absolute\r\nequilibrium; therefore, it is more noble and more perfect. \"It is not,\"\r\nthey say, \"that he has a special power and spirit which the other animals\r\nlack: animals possess sensitive bodies, but man in some powers has more\r\nsensation, although, in what concerns the outer senses, such as hearing,\r\nsight, taste, smell, touch and even in some interior powers like memory,\r\nthe animal is more richly endowed than man.\" \"The animal, too,\" they say,\r\n\"has intelligence and perception.\" All that they concede is that man's\r\nintelligence is greater.\r\n\r\nThis is what the philosophers of the present state; this is their saying,\r\nthis is their supposition, and thus their imagination decrees. So with\r\npowerful arguments and proofs they make the descent of man go back to the\r\nanimal, and say that there was once a time when man was an animal, that\r\nthen the species changed and progressed little by little until it reached\r\nthe present status of man.\r\n\r\nBut the theologians say: No, this is not so. Though man has powers and\r\nouter senses in common with the animal, yet an extraordinary power exists\r\nin him of which the animal is bereft. The sciences, arts, inventions,\r\ntrades and discoveries of realities are the results of this spiritual\r\npower. This is a power which encompasses all things, comprehends their\r\nrealities, discovers all the hidden mysteries of beings, and through this\r\nknowledge controls them. It even perceives things which do not exist\r\noutwardly--that is to say, intellectual realities which are not sensible,\r\nand which have no outward existence because they are invisible; so it\r\ncomprehends the mind, the spirit, the qualities, the characters, the love\r\nand sorrow of man, which are intellectual realities. Moreover, these\r\nexisting sciences, arts, laws and endless inventions of man at one time\r\nwere invisible, mysterious and hidden secrets; it is only the\r\nall-encompassing human power which has discovered and brought them out\r\nfrom the plane of the invisible to the plane of the visible. So\r\ntelegraphy, photography, phonography and all such inventions and wonderful\r\narts were at one time hidden mysteries. The human reality discovered and\r\nbrought them out from the plane of the invisible to the plane of the\r\nvisible. There was even a time when the qualities of this iron which you\r\nsee--indeed of all the minerals--were hidden mysteries; men discovered this\r\nmineral, and wrought it in this industrial form. It is the same with all\r\nthe other discoveries and inventions of man, which are innumerable.\r\n\r\nThis we cannot deny. If we say that these are effects of powers which\r\nanimals also have, and of the powers of the bodily senses, we see clearly\r\nand evidently that the animals are, in regard to these powers, superior to\r\nman. For example, the sight of animals is much more keen than the sight of\r\nman; so also is their power of smell and taste. Briefly, in the powers\r\nwhich animals and men have in common, the animal is often the more\r\npowerful. For example, let us take the power of memory. If you carry a\r\npigeon from here to a distant country, and there set it free, it will\r\nreturn, for it remembers the way. Take a dog from here to the center of\r\nAsia, set him free, and he will come back here and never once lose the\r\nroad. So it is with the other powers such as hearing, sight, smell, taste\r\nand touch.\r\n\r\nThus it is clear that if there were not in man a power different from any\r\nof those of the animals, the latter would be superior to man in inventions\r\nand the comprehension of realities. Therefore, it is evident that man has\r\na gift which the animal does not possess. Now, the animal perceives\r\nsensible things but does not perceive intellectual realities. For example,\r\nthat which is within the range of its vision the animal sees, but that\r\nwhich is beyond the range of sight it is not possible for it to perceive,\r\nand it cannot imagine it. So it is not possible for the animal to\r\nunderstand that the earth has the form of a globe. But man from known\r\nthings proves unknown things and discovers unknown truths. For example,\r\nman sees the curve of the horizon, and from this he infers the roundness\r\nof the earth. The Pole Star at Akka, for instance, is at 33--that is to\r\nsay, it is 33 above the horizon. When a man goes toward the North Pole,\r\nthe Pole Star rises one degree above the horizon for each degree of\r\ndistance that he travels--that is to say, the altitude of the Pole Star\r\nwill be 34, then 40, then 50, then 60, then 70. If he reaches the North\r\nPole the altitude of the Pole Star will be 90 or have attained the\r\nzenith--that is to say, will be directly overhead. This Pole Star and its\r\nascension are sensible things. The further one goes toward the Pole, the\r\nhigher the Pole Star rises; from these two known truths an unknown thing\r\nhas been discovered--that is, that the horizon is curved, meaning that the\r\nhorizon of each degree of the earth is a different horizon from that of\r\nanother degree. Man perceives this and proves from it an invisible thing\r\nwhich is the roundness of the earth. This it is impossible for the animal\r\nto perceive. In the same way, it cannot understand that the sun is the\r\ncenter and that the earth revolves around it. The animal is the captive of\r\nthe senses and bound by them; all that is beyond the senses, the things\r\nthat they do not control, the animal can never understand, although in the\r\nouter senses it is greater than man. Hence it is proved and verified that\r\nin man there is a power of discovery by which he is distinguished from the\r\nanimals, and this is the spirit of man.\r\n\r\nPraise be to God! man is always turned toward the heights, and his\r\naspiration is lofty; he always desires to reach a greater world than the\r\nworld in which he is, and to mount to a higher sphere than that in which\r\nhe is. The love of exaltation is one of the characteristics of man. I am\r\nastonished that certain philosophers of America and Europe are content to\r\ngradually approach the animal world and so to go backward; for the\r\ntendency of existence must be toward exaltation. Nevertheless, if you said\r\nto one of them, \"You are an animal,\" he would be extremely hurt and angry.\r\n\r\nWhat a difference between the human world and the world of the animal,\r\nbetween the elevation of man and the abasement of the animal, between the\r\nperfections of man and the ignorance of the animal, between the light of\r\nman and the darkness of the animal, between the glory of man and the\r\ndegradation of the animal! An Arab child of ten years can manage two or\r\nthree hundred camels in the desert, and with his voice can lead them\r\nforward or turn them back. A weak Hindu can so control a huge elephant\r\nthat the elephant becomes the most obedient of servants. All things are\r\nsubdued by the hand of man; he can resist nature while all other creatures\r\nare captives of nature: none can depart from her requirements. Man alone\r\ncan resist nature. Nature attracts bodies to the center of the earth; man\r\nthrough mechanical means goes far from it and soars in the air. Nature\r\nprevents man from crossing the seas; man builds a ship, and he travels and\r\nvoyages across the great ocean, and so on; the subject is endless. For\r\nexample, man drives engines over the mountains and through the\r\nwildernesses, and gathers in one spot the news of the events of the East\r\nand West. All this is contrary to nature. The sea with its grandeur cannot\r\ndeviate by an atom from the laws of nature; the sun in all its\r\nmagnificence cannot deviate as much as a needle's point from the laws of\r\nnature, and can never comprehend the conditions, the state, the qualities,\r\nthe movements and the nature of man.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the power in this small body of man which encompasses all\r\nthis? What is this ruling power by which he subdues all things?\r\n\r\nOne more point remains. Modern philosophers say: \"We have never seen the\r\nspirit in man, and in spite of our researches into the secrets of the\r\nhuman body, we do not perceive a spiritual power. How can we imagine a\r\npower which is not sensible?\" The theologians reply: \"The spirit of the\r\nanimal also is not sensible, and through its bodily powers it cannot be\r\nperceived. By what do you prove the existence of the spirit of the animal?\r\nThere is no doubt that from its effects you prove that in the animal there\r\nis a power which is not in the plant, and this is the power of the\r\nsenses--that is to say, sight, hearing and also other powers; from these\r\nyou infer that there is an animal spirit. In the same way, from the proofs\r\nand signs we have mentioned, we argue that there is a human spirit. Since\r\nin the animal there are signs which are not in the plant, you say this\r\npower of sensation is a property of the animal spirit; you also see in man\r\nsigns, powers and perfections which do not exist in the animal; therefore,\r\nyou infer that there is a power in him which the animal is without.\"\r\n\r\nIf we wish to deny everything that is not sensible, then we must deny the\r\nrealities which unquestionably exist. For example, ethereal matter is not\r\nsensible, though it has an undoubted existence. The power of attraction is\r\nnot sensible, though it certainly exists. From what do we affirm these\r\nexistences? From their signs. Thus this light is the vibration of that\r\nethereal matter, and from this vibration we infer the existence of ether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49: THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What do you say with regard to the theories held by some\r\nEuropean philosophers on the growth and development of beings?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--This subject was spoken of the other day, but we will speak of it\r\nagain. Briefly, this question will be decided by determining whether\r\nspecies are original or not--that is to say, has the species of man been\r\nestablished from its origin, or was it afterward derived from the animals?\r\n\r\nCertain European philosophers agree that the species grows and develops,\r\nand that even change and alteration are also possible. One of the proofs\r\nthat they give for this theory is that through the attentive study and\r\nverification of the science of geology it has become clear that the\r\nexistence of the vegetable preceded that of the animal, and that of the\r\nanimal preceded that of man. They admit that both the vegetable and the\r\nanimal species have changed, for in some of the strata of the earth they\r\nhave discovered plants which existed in the past and are now extinct; they\r\nhave progressed, grown in strength, their form and appearance have\r\nchanged, and so the species have altered. In the same way, in the strata\r\nof the earth there are some species of animals which have changed and are\r\ntransformed. One of these animals is the serpent. There are indications\r\nthat the serpent once had feet, but through the lapse of time those\r\nmembers have disappeared. In the same way, in the vertebral column of man\r\nthere is an indication which amounts to a proof that, like other animals,\r\nhe once had a tail. At one time that member was useful, but when man\r\ndeveloped, it was no longer of use; and, therefore, it gradually\r\ndisappeared. As the serpent took refuge under the ground and became a\r\ncreeping animal, it was no longer in need of feet, so they disappeared;\r\nbut their traces survive. The principal argument is this: that the\r\nexistence of traces of members proves that they once existed, and as now\r\nthey are no longer of service, they have gradually disappeared. Therefore,\r\nwhile the perfect and necessary members have remained, those which are\r\nunnecessary have gradually disappeared by the modification of the species,\r\nbut the traces of them continue.\r\n\r\nThe first answer to this argument is the fact that the animal having\r\npreceded man is not a proof of the evolution, change and alteration of the\r\nspecies, nor that man was raised from the animal world to the human world.\r\nFor while the individual appearance of these different beings is certain,\r\nit is possible that man came into existence after the animal. So when we\r\nexamine the vegetable kingdom, we see that the fruits of the different\r\ntrees do not arrive at maturity at one time; on the contrary, some come\r\nfirst and others afterward. This priority does not prove that the later\r\nfruit of one tree was produced from the earlier fruit of another tree.\r\n\r\nSecond, these slight signs and traces of members have perhaps a great\r\nreason of which the mind is not yet cognizant. How many things exist of\r\nwhich we do not yet know the reason! So the science of physiology--that is\r\nto say, the knowledge of the composition of the members--records that the\r\nreason and cause of the difference in the colors of animals, and of the\r\nhair of men, of the redness of the lips, and of the variety of the colors\r\nof birds, is still unknown; it is secret and hidden. But it is known that\r\nthe pupil of the eye is black so as to attract the rays of the sun, for if\r\nit were another color--that is, uniformly white--it would not attract the\r\nrays of the sun. Therefore, as the reason of the things we have mentioned\r\nis unknown, it is possible that the reason and the wisdom of these traces\r\nof members, whether they be in the animal or man, are equally unknown.\r\nCertainly there is a reason, even though it is not known.\r\n\r\nThird, let us suppose that there was a time when some animals, or even\r\nman, possessed some members which have now disappeared; this is not a\r\nsufficient proof of the change and evolution of the species. For man, from\r\nthe beginning of the embryonic period till he reaches the degree of\r\nmaturity, goes through different forms and appearances. His aspect, his\r\nform, his appearance and color change; he passes from one form to another,\r\nand from one appearance to another. Nevertheless, from the beginning of\r\nthe embryonic period he is of the species of man--that is to say, an embryo\r\nof a man and not of an animal; but this is not at first apparent, but\r\nlater it becomes visible and evident. For example, let us suppose that man\r\nonce resembled the animal, and that now he has progressed and changed.\r\nSupposing this to be true, it is still not a proof of the change of\r\nspecies. No, as before mentioned, it is merely like the change and\r\nalteration of the embryo of man until it reaches the degree of reason and\r\nperfection. We will state it more clearly. Let us suppose that there was a\r\ntime when man walked on his hands and feet, or had a tail; this change and\r\nalteration is like that of the fetus in the womb of the mother. Although\r\nit changes in all ways, and grows and develops until it reaches the\r\nperfect form, from the beginning it is a special species. We also see in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom that the original species of the genus do not change\r\nand alter, but the form, color and bulk will change and alter, or even\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: as man in the womb of the mother passes from form to\r\nform, from shape to shape, changes and develops, and is still the human\r\nspecies from the beginning of the embryonic period--in the same way man,\r\nfrom the beginning of his existence in the matrix of the world, is also a\r\ndistinct species--that is, man--and has gradually evolved from one form to\r\nanother. Therefore, this change of appearance, this evolution of members,\r\nthis development and growth, even though we admit the reality of growth\r\nand progress,(141) does not prevent the species from being original. Man\r\nfrom the beginning was in this perfect form and composition, and possessed\r\ncapacity and aptitude for acquiring material and spiritual perfections,\r\nand was the manifestation of these words, \"We will make man in Our image\r\nand likeness.\"(142) He has only become more pleasing, more beautiful and\r\nmore graceful. Civilization has brought him out of his wild state, just as\r\nthe wild fruits which are cultivated by a gardener become finer, sweeter\r\nand acquire more freshness and delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe gardeners of the world of humanity are the Prophets of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50: SPIRITUAL PROOFS OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proofs which we have adduced relative to the origin of the human\r\nspecies were logical proofs. Now we will give the spiritual proofs, which\r\nare essential. For, as we have proved Divinity by logical arguments, and\r\nhave also proved logically that man exists from his origin and foundation\r\nas man, and that his species has existed from all eternity, now we will\r\nestablish spiritual proofs that human existence--that is, the species of\r\nman--is a necessary existence, and that without man the perfections of\r\nDivinity would not appear. But these are spiritual proofs, not logical\r\nproofs.\r\n\r\nWe have many times demonstrated and established that man is the noblest of\r\nbeings, the sum of all perfections, and that all beings and all existences\r\nare the centers from which the glory of God is reflected--that is to say,\r\nthe signs of the Divinity of God are apparent in the realities of things\r\nand of creatures. Just as the terrestrial globe is the place where the\r\nrays of the sun are reflected--as its light, its heat and its influence are\r\napparent and visible in all the atoms of the earth--so, in the same way,\r\nthe atoms of beings, in this infinite space, proclaim and prove one of the\r\ndivine perfections. Nothing is deprived of this benefit; either it is a\r\nsign of the mercy of God, or it is a sign of His power, His greatness, His\r\njustice, His nurturing providence; or it is a sign of the generosity of\r\nGod, His vision, His hearing, His knowledge, His grace and so on.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt each being is the center of the shining forth of the glory\r\nof God--that is to say, the perfections of God appear from it and are\r\nresplendent in it. It is like the sun, which is resplendent in the desert,\r\nupon the sea, in the trees, in the fruits and blossoms, and in all earthly\r\nthings. The world, indeed each existing being, proclaims to us one of the\r\nnames of God, but the reality of man is the collective reality, the\r\ngeneral reality, and is the center where the glory of all the perfections\r\nof God shine forth--that is to say, for each name, each attribute, each\r\nperfection which we affirm of God there exists a sign in man. If it were\r\notherwise, man could not imagine these perfections and could not\r\nunderstand them. So we say that God is the seer, and the eye is the sign\r\nof His vision; if this sight were not in man, how could we imagine the\r\nvision of God? For the blind (that is, one born blind) cannot imagine\r\nsight; and the deaf (that is, one deaf from birth) cannot imagine hearing;\r\nand the dead cannot realize life. Consequently, the Divinity of God, which\r\nis the sum of all perfections, reflects itself in the reality of man--that\r\nis to say, the Essence of Oneness is the gathering of all perfections, and\r\nfrom this unity He casts a reflection upon the human reality. Man, then,\r\nis the perfect mirror facing the Sun of Truth and is the center of\r\nradiation: the Sun of Truth shines in this mirror. The reflection of the\r\ndivine perfections appears in the reality of man, so he is the\r\nrepresentative of God, the messenger of God. If man did not exist, the\r\nuniverse would be without result, for the object of existence is the\r\nappearance of the perfections of God.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it cannot be said there was a time when man was not. All that\r\nwe can say is that this terrestrial globe at one time did not exist, and\r\nat its beginning man did not appear upon it. But from the beginning which\r\nhas no beginning, to the end which has no end, a Perfect Manifestation\r\nalways exists. This Man of Whom we speak is not every man; we mean the\r\nPerfect Man. For the noblest part of the tree is the fruit, which is the\r\nreason of its existence. If the tree had no fruit, it would have no\r\nmeaning. Therefore, it cannot be imagined that the worlds of existence,\r\nwhether the stars or this earth, were once inhabited by the donkey, cow,\r\nmouse and cat, and that they were without man! This supposition is false\r\nand meaningless. The word of God is clear as the sun. This is a spiritual\r\nproof, but one which we cannot at the beginning put forth for the benefit\r\nof the materialists. First we must speak of the logical proofs, afterward\r\nthe spiritual proofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51: THE SPIRIT AND MIND OF MAN HAVE EXISTED FROM THE BEGINNING\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Does man in the beginning possess mind and spirit, or are they\r\nan outcome of his evolution?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The beginning of the existence of man on the terrestrial globe\r\nresembles his formation in the womb of the mother. The embryo in the womb\r\nof the mother gradually grows and develops until birth, after which it\r\ncontinues to grow and develop until it reaches the age of discretion and\r\nmaturity. Though in infancy the signs of the mind and spirit appear in\r\nman, they do not reach the degree of perfection; they are imperfect. Only\r\nwhen man attains maturity do the mind and the spirit appear and become\r\nevident in utmost perfection.\r\n\r\nSo also the formation of man in the matrix of the world was in the\r\nbeginning like the embryo; then gradually he made progress in perfectness,\r\nand grew and developed until he reached the state of maturity, when the\r\nmind and spirit became visible in the greatest power. In the beginning of\r\nhis formation the mind and spirit also existed, but they were hidden;\r\nlater they were manifested. In the womb of the world mind and spirit also\r\nexisted in the embryo, but they were concealed; afterward they appeared.\r\nSo it is that in the seed the tree exists, but it is hidden and concealed;\r\nwhen it develops and grows, the complete tree appears. In the same way the\r\ngrowth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal\r\ndivine organization and the natural system. The seed does not at once\r\nbecome a tree; the embryo does not at once become a man; the mineral does\r\nnot suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and\r\nattain the limit of perfection.\r\n\r\nAll beings, whether large or small, were created perfect and complete from\r\nthe first, but their perfections appear in them by degrees. The\r\norganization of God is one; the evolution of existence is one; the divine\r\nsystem is one. Whether they be small or great beings, all are subject to\r\none law and system. Each seed has in it from the first all the vegetable\r\nperfections. For example, in the seed all the vegetable perfections exist\r\nfrom the beginning, but not visibly; afterward little by little they\r\nappear. So it is first the shoot which appears from the seed, then the\r\nbranches, leaves, blossoms and fruits; but from the beginning of its\r\nexistence all these things are in the seed, potentially, though not\r\napparently.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the embryo possesses from the first all perfections, such\r\nas the spirit, the mind, the sight, the smell, the taste--in one word, all\r\nthe powers--but they are not visible and become so only by degrees.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the terrestrial globe from the beginning was created with all\r\nits elements, substances, minerals, atoms and organisms; but these only\r\nappeared by degrees: first the mineral, then the plant, afterward the\r\nanimal, and finally man. But from the first these kinds and species\r\nexisted, but were undeveloped in the terrestrial globe, and then appeared\r\nonly gradually. For the supreme organization of God, and the universal\r\nnatural system, surround all beings, and all are subject to this rule.\r\nWhen you consider this universal system, you see that there is not one of\r\nthe beings which at its coming into existence has reached the limit of\r\nperfection. No, they gradually grow and develop, and then attain the\r\ndegree of perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52: THE APPEARING OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BODY\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the wisdom of the spirit's appearing in the body?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The wisdom of the appearance of the spirit in the body is this:\r\nthe human spirit is a Divine Trust, and it must traverse all conditions,\r\nfor its passage and movement through the conditions of existence will be\r\nthe means of its acquiring perfections. So when a man travels and passes\r\nthrough different regions and numerous countries with system and method,\r\nit is certainly a means of his acquiring perfection, for he will see\r\nplaces, scenes and countries, from which he will discover the conditions\r\nand states of other nations. He will thus become acquainted with the\r\ngeography of countries and their wonders and arts; he will familiarize\r\nhimself with the habits, customs and usages of peoples; he will see the\r\ncivilization and progress of the epoch; he will become aware of the policy\r\nof governments and the power and capacity of each country. It is the same\r\nwhen the human spirit passes through the conditions of existence: it will\r\nbecome the possessor of each degree and station. Even in the condition of\r\nthe body it will surely acquire perfections.\r\n\r\nBesides this, it is necessary that the signs of the perfection of the\r\nspirit should be apparent in this world, so that the world of creation may\r\nbring forth endless results, and this body may receive life and manifest\r\nthe divine bounties. So, for example, the rays of the sun must shine upon\r\nthe earth, and the solar heat develop the earthly beings; if the rays and\r\nheat of the sun did not shine upon the earth, the earth would be\r\nuninhabited, without meaning; and its development would be retarded. In\r\nthe same way, if the perfections of the spirit did not appear in this\r\nworld, this world would be unenlightened and absolutely brutal. By the\r\nappearance of the spirit in the physical form, this world is enlightened.\r\nAs the spirit of man is the cause of the life of the body, so the world is\r\nin the condition of the body, and man is in the condition of the spirit.\r\nIf there were no man, the perfections of the spirit would not appear, and\r\nthe light of the mind would not be resplendent in this world. This world\r\nwould be like a body without a soul.\r\n\r\nThis world is also in the condition of a fruit tree, and man is like the\r\nfruit; without fruit the tree would be useless.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these members, these elements, this composition, which are found\r\nin the organism of man, are an attraction and magnet for the spirit; it is\r\ncertain that the spirit will appear in it. So a mirror which is clear will\r\ncertainly attract the rays of the sun. It will become luminous, and\r\nwonderful images will appear in it--that is to say, when these existing\r\nelements are gathered together according to the natural order, and with\r\nperfect strength, they become a magnet for the spirit, and the spirit will\r\nbecome manifest in them with all its perfections.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions it cannot be said, \"What is the necessity for the\r\nrays of the sun to descend upon the mirror?\"--for the connection which\r\nexists between the reality of things, whether they be spiritual or\r\nmaterial, requires that when the mirror is clear and faces the sun, the\r\nlight of the sun must become apparent in it. In the same way, when the\r\nelements are arranged and combined in the most glorious system,\r\norganization and manner, the human spirit will appear and be manifest in\r\nthem. This is the decree of the Powerful, the Wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53: THE RELATION BETWEEN GOD AND THE CREATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the nature of the connection between God and the\r\ncreature--that is to say, between the Independent, the Most High, and the\r\nother beings?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The connection between God and the creatures is that of the\r\ncreator to the creation; it is like the connection between the sun and the\r\ndark bodies of contingent beings, and is the connection between the maker\r\nand the things that he has made. The sun in its own essence is independent\r\nof the bodies which it lights, for its light is in itself and is free and\r\nindependent of the terrestrial globe; so the earth is under the influence\r\nof the sun and receives its light, whereas the sun and its rays are\r\nentirely independent of the earth. But if there were no sun, the earth and\r\nall earthly beings could not exist.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of the creatures upon God is a dependence of emanation--that\r\nis to say, creatures emanate from God; they do not manifest Him.(143) The\r\nrelation is that of emanation and not that of manifestation. The light of\r\nthe sun emanates from the sun; it does not manifest it. The appearance\r\nthrough emanation is like the appearance of the rays from the luminary of\r\nthe horizons of the world--that is to say, the holy essence of the Sun of\r\nTruth is not divided and does not descend to the condition of the\r\ncreatures. In the same way, the globe of the sun does not become divided\r\nand does not descend to the earth. No, the rays of the sun, which are its\r\nbounty, emanate from it and illumine the dark bodies.\r\n\r\nBut the appearance through manifestation is the manifestation of the\r\nbranches, leaves, blossoms and fruit from the seed; for the seed in its\r\nown essence becomes branches and fruits, and its reality enters into the\r\nbranches, the leaves and fruits. This appearance through manifestation\r\nwould be for God, the Most High, simple imperfection; and this is quite\r\nimpossible, for the implication would be that the Absolute Preexistent is\r\nqualified with phenomenal attributes. But if this were so, pure\r\nindependence would become mere poverty, and true existence would become\r\nnonexistence, and this is impossible.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all creatures emanate from God--that is to say, it is by God\r\nthat all things are realized, and by Him that all beings have attained to\r\nexistence. The first thing which emanated from God is that universal\r\nreality, which the ancient philosophers termed the \"First Mind,\" and which\r\nthe people of Baha call the \"First Will.\" This emanation, in that which\r\nconcerns its action in the world of God, is not limited by time or place;\r\nit is without beginning or end--beginning and end in relation to God are\r\none. The preexistence of God is the preexistence of essence, and also\r\npreexistence of time, and the phenomenality of contingency is essential\r\nand not temporal, as we have already explained one day at table.(144)\r\n\r\nThough the \"First Mind\" is without beginning, it does not become a sharer\r\nin the preexistence of God, for the existence of the universal reality in\r\nrelation to the existence of God is nothingness, and it has not the power\r\nto become an associate of God and like unto Him in preexistence. This\r\nsubject has been before explained.\r\n\r\nThe existence of living things signifies composition, and their death,\r\ndecomposition. But universal matter and the elements do not become\r\nabsolutely annihilated and destroyed. No, their nonexistence is simply\r\ntransformation. For instance, when man is annihilated, he becomes dust;\r\nbut he does not become absolutely nonexistent. He still exists in the\r\nshape of dust, but transformation has taken place, and this composition is\r\naccidentally decomposed. The annihilation of the other beings is the same,\r\nfor existence does not become absolute nonexistence, and absolute\r\nnonexistence does not become existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54: ON THE PROCEEDING OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT FROM GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--In the Bible it is said that God breathed the spirit into the\r\nbody of man. What is the meaning of this verse?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Know that proceeding is of two kinds: the proceeding and\r\nappearance through emanation, and the proceeding and appearance through\r\nmanifestation. The proceeding through emanation is like the coming forth\r\nof the action from the actor, of the writing from the writer. Now the\r\nwriting emanates from the writer, and the discourse emanates from the\r\nspeaker, and in the same way the human spirit emanates from God. It is not\r\nthat it manifests God--that is to say, no part has been detached from the\r\nDivine Reality to enter the body of man. No, as the discourse emanates\r\nfrom the speaker, the spirit appears in the body of man.\r\n\r\nBut the proceeding through manifestation is the manifestation of the\r\nreality of a thing in other forms, like the coming forth of this tree from\r\nthe seed of the tree, or the coming forth of the flower from the seed of\r\nthe flower, for it is the seed itself which appears in the form of the\r\nbranches, leaves and flowers. This is called the proceeding through\r\nmanifestation. The spirits of men, with reference to God, have dependence\r\nthrough emanation, just as the discourse proceeds from the speaker and the\r\nwriting from the writer--that is to say, the speaker himself does not\r\nbecome the discourse, nor does the writer himself become the writing; no,\r\nrather they have the proceeding of emanation. The speaker has perfect\r\nability and power, and the discourse emanates from him, as the action does\r\nfrom the actor. The Real Speaker, the Essence of Unity, has always been in\r\none condition, which neither changes nor alters, has neither\r\ntransformation nor vicissitude. He is the Eternal, the Immortal.\r\nTherefore, the proceeding of the human spirits from God is through\r\nemanation. When it is said in the Bible that God breathed His spirit into\r\nman, this spirit is that which, like the discourse, emanates from the Real\r\nSpeaker, taking effect in the reality of man.\r\n\r\nBut the proceeding through manifestation (if by this is meant the divine\r\nappearance, and not division into parts), we have said, is the proceeding\r\nand the appearance of the Holy Spirit and the Word, which is from God. As\r\nit is said in the Gospel of John, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the\r\nWord was with God\";(145) then the Holy Spirit and the Word are the\r\nappearance of God. The Spirit and the Word mean the divine perfections\r\nthat appeared in the Reality of Christ, and these perfections were with\r\nGod; so the sun manifests all its glory in the mirror. For the Word does\r\nnot signify the body of Christ, no, but the divine perfections manifested\r\nin Him. For Christ was like a clear mirror which was facing the Sun of\r\nReality; and the perfections of the Sun of Reality--that is to say, its\r\nlight and heat--were visible and apparent in this mirror. If we look into\r\nthe mirror, we see the sun, and we say, \"It is the sun.\" Therefore, the\r\nWord and the Holy Spirit, which signify the perfections of God, are the\r\ndivine appearance. This is the meaning of the verse in the Gospel which\r\nsays: \"The Word was with God, and the Word was God\";(146) for the divine\r\nperfections are not different from the Essence of Oneness. The perfections\r\nof Christ are called the Word because all the beings are in the condition\r\nof letters, and one letter has not a complete meaning, while the\r\nperfections of Christ have the power of the word because a complete\r\nmeaning can be inferred from a word. As the Reality of Christ was the\r\nmanifestation of the divine perfections, therefore, it was like the word.\r\nWhy? because He is the sum of perfect meanings. This is why He is called\r\nthe Word.\r\n\r\nAnd know that the proceeding of the Word and the Holy Spirit from God,\r\nwhich is the proceeding and appearance of manifestation, must not be\r\nunderstood to mean that the Reality of Divinity had been divided into\r\nparts, or multiplied, or that it had descended from the exaltation of\r\nholiness and purity. God forbid! If a pure, fine mirror faces the sun, the\r\nlight and heat, the form and the image of the sun will be resplendent in\r\nit with such manifestation that if a beholder says of the sun, which is\r\nbrilliant and visible in the mirror, \"This is the sun,\" it is true.\r\nNevertheless, the mirror is the mirror, and the sun is the sun. The One\r\nSun, even if it appears in numerous mirrors, is one. This state is neither\r\nabiding nor entering, neither commingling nor descending; for entering,\r\nabiding, descending, issuing forth and commingling are the necessities and\r\ncharacteristics of bodies, not of spirits; then how much less do they\r\nbelong to the sanctified and pure Reality of God. God is exempt from all\r\nthat is not in accordance with His purity and His exalted and sublime\r\nsanctity.\r\n\r\nThe Sun of Reality, as we have said, has always been in one condition; it\r\nhas no change, no alteration, no transformation and no vicissitude. It is\r\neternal and everlasting. But the Holy Reality of the Word of God is in the\r\ncondition of the pure, fine and shining mirror; the heat, the light, the\r\nimage and likeness--that is to say, the perfections of the Sun of\r\nReality--appear in it. That is why Christ says in the Gospel, \"The Father\r\nis in the Son\"--that is to say, the Sun of Reality appears in the\r\nmirror.(147) Praise be to the One Who shone upon this Holy Reality, Who is\r\nsanctified among the beings!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55: SOUL, SPIRIT AND MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the difference between the mind, spirit and soul?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--It has been before explained that spirit is universally divided\r\ninto five categories: the vegetable spirit, the animal spirit, the human\r\nspirit, the spirit of faith, and the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable spirit is the power of growth which is brought about in the\r\nseed through the influence of other existences.\r\n\r\nThe animal spirit is the power of all the senses, which is realized from\r\nthe composition and mingling of elements; when this composition\r\ndecomposes, the power also perishes and becomes annihilated. It may be\r\nlikened to this lamp: when the oil, wick and fire are combined, it is\r\nlighted; and when this combination is dissolved--that is to say, when the\r\ncombined parts are separated from one another--the lamp also is\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nThe human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal is the rational\r\nsoul, and these two names--the human spirit and the rational soul--designate\r\none thing. This spirit, which in the terminology of the philosophers is\r\nthe rational soul, embraces all beings, and as far as human ability\r\npermits discovers the realities of things and becomes cognizant of their\r\npeculiarities and effects, and of the qualities and properties of beings.\r\nBut the human spirit, unless assisted by the spirit of faith, does not\r\nbecome acquainted with the divine secrets and the heavenly realities. It\r\nis like a mirror which, although clear, polished and brilliant, is still\r\nin need of light. Until a ray of the sun reflects upon it, it cannot\r\ndiscover the heavenly secrets.\r\n\r\nBut the mind is the power of the human spirit. Spirit is the lamp; mind is\r\nthe light which shines from the lamp. Spirit is the tree, and the mind is\r\nthe fruit. Mind is the perfection of the spirit and is its essential\r\nquality, as the sun's rays are the essential necessity of the sun.\r\n\r\nThis explanation, though short, is complete; therefore, reflect upon it,\r\nand if God wills, you may become acquainted with the details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56: THE PHYSICAL POWERS AND THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn man five outer powers exist, which are the agents of perception--that is\r\nto say, through these five powers man perceives material beings. These are\r\nsight, which perceives visible forms; hearing, which perceives audible\r\nsounds; smell, which perceives odors; taste, which perceives foods; and\r\nfeeling, which is in all parts of the body and perceives tangible things.\r\nThese five powers perceive outward existences.\r\n\r\nMan has also spiritual powers: imagination, which conceives things;\r\nthought, which reflects upon realities; comprehension, which comprehends\r\nrealities; memory, which retains whatever man imagines, thinks and\r\ncomprehends. The intermediary between the five outward powers and the\r\ninward powers is the sense which they possess in common--that is to say,\r\nthe sense which acts between the outer and inner powers, conveys to the\r\ninward powers whatever the outer powers discern. It is termed the common\r\nfaculty, because it communicates between the outward and inward powers and\r\nthus is common to the outward and inward powers.\r\n\r\nFor instance, sight is one of the outer powers; it sees and perceives this\r\nflower, and conveys this perception to the inner power--the common\r\nfaculty--which transmits this perception to the power of imagination, which\r\nin its turn conceives and forms this image and transmits it to the power\r\nof thought; the power of thought reflects and, having grasped the reality,\r\nconveys it to the power of comprehension; the comprehension, when it has\r\ncomprehended it, delivers the image of the object perceived to the memory,\r\nand the memory keeps it in its repository.\r\n\r\nThe outward powers are five: the power of sight, of hearing, of taste, of\r\nsmell and of feeling.\r\n\r\nThe inner powers are also five: the common faculty, and the powers of\r\nimagination, thought, comprehension and memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57: THE CAUSES OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE CHARACTERS OF MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--How many kinds of character has man, and what is the cause of\r\nthe differences and varieties in men?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--He has the innate character, the inherited character, and the\r\nacquired character which is gained by education.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the innate character, although the divine creation is\r\npurely good, yet the varieties of natural qualities in man come from the\r\ndifference of degree; all are excellent, but they are more or less so,\r\naccording to the degree. So all mankind possess intelligence and\r\ncapacities, but the intelligence, the capacity and the worthiness of men\r\ndiffer. This is evident.\r\n\r\nFor example, take a number of children of one family, of one place, of one\r\nschool, instructed by one teacher, reared on the same food, in the same\r\nclimate, with the same clothing, and studying the same lessons--it is\r\ncertain that among these children some will be clever in the sciences,\r\nsome will be of average ability, and some dull. Hence it is clear that in\r\nthe original nature there exists a difference of degree and varieties of\r\nworthiness and capacity. This difference does not imply good or evil but\r\nis simply a difference of degree. One has the highest degree, another the\r\nmedium degree, and another the lowest degree. So man exists; the animal,\r\nthe plant and the mineral exist also--but the degrees of these four\r\nexistences vary. What a difference between the existence of man and of the\r\nanimal! Yet both are existences. It is evident that in existence there are\r\ndifferences of degrees.\r\n\r\nThe variety of inherited qualities comes from strength and weakness of\r\nconstitution--that is to say, when the two parents are weak, the children\r\nwill be weak; if they are strong, the children will be robust. In the same\r\nway, purity of blood has a great effect; for the pure germ is like the\r\nsuperior stock which exists in plants and animals. For example, you see\r\nthat children born from a weak and feeble father and mother will naturally\r\nhave a feeble constitution and weak nerves; they will be afflicted and\r\nwill have neither patience, nor endurance, nor resolution, nor\r\nperseverance, and will be hasty; for the children inherit the weakness and\r\ndebility of their parents.\r\n\r\nBesides this, an especial blessing is conferred on some families and some\r\ngenerations. Thus it is an especial blessing that from among the\r\ndescendants of Abraham should have come all the Prophets of the children\r\nof Israel. This is a blessing that God has granted to this descent: to\r\nMoses from His father and mother, to Christ from His mother's line; also\r\nto Muhammad and the Bab, and to all the Prophets and the Holy\r\nManifestations of Israel. The Blessed Beauty(148) is also a lineal\r\ndescendant of Abraham, for Abraham had other sons besides Ishmael and\r\nIsaac who in those days migrated to the lands of Persia and Afghanistan,\r\nand the Blessed Beauty is one of their descendants.\r\n\r\nHence it is evident that inherited character also exists, and to such a\r\ndegree that if the characters are not in conformity with their origin,\r\nalthough they belong physically to that lineage, spiritually they are not\r\nconsidered members of the family, like Canaan,(149) who is not reckoned as\r\nbeing of the race of Noah.\r\n\r\nBut the difference of the qualities with regard to culture is very great,\r\nfor education has great influence. Through education the ignorant become\r\nlearned; the cowardly become valiant. Through cultivation the crooked\r\nbranch becomes straight; the acid, bitter fruit of the mountains and woods\r\nbecomes sweet and delicious; and the five-petaled flower becomes hundred\r\npetaled. Through education savage nations become civilized, and even the\r\nanimals become domesticated. Education must be considered as most\r\nimportant, for as diseases in the world of bodies are extremely\r\ncontagious, so, in the same way, qualities of spirit and heart are\r\nextremely contagious. Education has a universal influence, and the\r\ndifferences caused by it are very great.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone will say that, since the capacity and worthiness of men\r\ndiffer, therefore, the difference of capacity certainly causes the\r\ndifference of characters.(150)\r\n\r\nBut this is not so, for capacity is of two kinds: natural capacity and\r\nacquired capacity. The first, which is the creation of God, is purely\r\ngood--in the creation of God there is no evil; but the acquired capacity\r\nhas become the cause of the appearance of evil. For example, God has\r\ncreated all men in such a manner and has given them such a constitution\r\nand such capacities that they are benefited by sugar and honey and harmed\r\nand destroyed by poison. This nature and constitution is innate, and God\r\nhas given it equally to all mankind. But man begins little by little to\r\naccustom himself to poison by taking a small quantity each day, and\r\ngradually increasing it, until he reaches such a point that he cannot live\r\nwithout a gram of opium every day. The natural capacities are thus\r\ncompletely perverted. Observe how much the natural capacity and\r\nconstitution can be changed, until by different habits and training they\r\nbecome entirely perverted. One does not criticize vicious people because\r\nof their innate capacities and nature, but rather for their acquired\r\ncapacities and nature.\r\n\r\nIn creation there is no evil; all is good. Certain qualities and natures\r\ninnate in some men and apparently blameworthy are not so in reality. For\r\nexample, from the beginning of his life you can see in a nursing child the\r\nsigns of greed, of anger and of temper. Then, it may be said, good and\r\nevil are innate in the reality of man, and this is contrary to the pure\r\ngoodness of nature and creation. The answer to this is that greed, which\r\nis to ask for something more, is a praiseworthy quality provided that it\r\nis used suitably. So if a man is greedy to acquire science and knowledge,\r\nor to become compassionate, generous and just, it is most praiseworthy. If\r\nhe exercises his anger and wrath against the bloodthirsty tyrants who are\r\nlike ferocious beasts, it is very praiseworthy; but if he does not use\r\nthese qualities in a right way, they are blameworthy.\r\n\r\nThen it is evident that in creation and nature evil does not exist at all;\r\nbut when the natural qualities of man are used in an unlawful way, they\r\nare blameworthy. So if a rich and generous person gives a sum of money to\r\na poor man for his own necessities, and if the poor man spends that sum of\r\nmoney on unlawful things, that will be blameworthy. It is the same with\r\nall the natural qualities of man, which constitute the capital of life; if\r\nthey be used and displayed in an unlawful way, they become blameworthy.\r\nTherefore, it is clear that creation is purely good. Consider that the\r\nworst of qualities and most odious of attributes, which is the foundation\r\nof all evil, is lying. No worse or more blameworthy quality than this can\r\nbe imagined to exist; it is the destroyer of all human perfections and the\r\ncause of innumerable vices. There is no worse characteristic than this; it\r\nis the foundation of all evils. Notwithstanding all this, if a doctor\r\nconsoles a sick man by saying, \"Thank God you are better, and there is\r\nhope of your recovery,\" though these words are contrary to the truth, yet\r\nthey may become the consolation of the patient and the turning point of\r\nthe illness. This is not blameworthy.\r\n\r\nThis question is now clearly elucidated. Salutations!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58: THE DEGREE OF KNOWLEDGE POSSESSED BY MAN AND THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Of what degree is the perception of the human world, and what\r\nare its limitations?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Know that perception varies. The lowest degree of perception is\r\nthat of the animals--that is to say, the natural feeling which appears\r\nthrough the powers of the senses, and which is called sensation. In this,\r\nmen and animals are sharers; moreover, some animals with regard to the\r\nsenses are more powerful than man. But in humanity, perception differs and\r\nvaries in accordance with the different conditions of man.\r\n\r\nThe first condition of perception in the world of nature is the perception\r\nof the rational soul. In this perception and in this power all men are\r\nsharers, whether they be neglectful or vigilant, believers or deniers.\r\nThis human rational soul is God's creation; it encompasses and excels\r\nother creatures; as it is more noble and distinguished, it encompasses\r\nthings. The power of the rational soul can discover the realities of\r\nthings, comprehend the peculiarities of beings, and penetrate the\r\nmysteries of existence. All sciences, knowledge, arts, wonders,\r\ninstitutions, discoveries and enterprises come from the exercised\r\nintelligence of the rational soul. There was a time when they were\r\nunknown, preserved mysteries and hidden secrets; the rational soul\r\ngradually discovered them and brought them out from the plane of the\r\ninvisible and the hidden into the realm of the visible. This is the\r\ngreatest power of perception in the world of nature, which in its highest\r\nflight and soaring comprehends the realities, the properties and the\r\neffects of the contingent beings.\r\n\r\nBut the universal divine mind, which is beyond nature, is the bounty of\r\nthe Preexistent Power. This universal mind is divine; it embraces existing\r\nrealities, and it receives the light of the mysteries of God. It is a\r\nconscious power, not a power of investigation and of research. The\r\nintellectual power of the world of nature is a power of investigation, and\r\nby its researches it discovers the realities of beings and the properties\r\nof existences; but the heavenly intellectual power, which is beyond\r\nnature, embraces things and is cognizant of things, knows them,\r\nunderstands them, is aware of mysteries, realities and divine\r\nsignifications, and is the discoverer of the concealed verities of the\r\nKingdom. This divine intellectual power is the special attribute of the\r\nHoly Manifestations and the Dawning-places of prophethood; a ray of this\r\nlight falls upon the mirrors of the hearts of the righteous, and a portion\r\nand a share of this power comes to them through the Holy Manifestations.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Manifestations have three conditions: one, the physical\r\ncondition; one, that of the rational soul; and one, that of the\r\nmanifestation of perfection and of the lordly splendor. The body\r\ncomprehends things according to the degree of its ability in the physical\r\nworld; therefore, in certain cases it shows physical weakness. For\r\nexample: \"I was sleeping and unconscious; the breeze of God passed over Me\r\nand awoke Me, and commanded Me to proclaim the Word\"; or when Christ in\r\nHis thirtieth year was baptized, and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him;\r\nbefore this the Holy Spirit did not manifest itself in Him. All these\r\nthings refer to the bodily condition of the Manifestations; but Their\r\nheavenly condition embraces all things, knows all mysteries, discovers all\r\nsigns, and rules over all things; before as well as after Their mission,\r\nit is the same. That is why Christ has said: \"I am Alpha and Omega, the\r\nfirst and the last\"(151)--that is to say, there has never been and never\r\nshall be any change and alteration in Me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59: MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--To what extent can the understanding of man comprehend God?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--This subject requires ample time, and to explain it thus at table\r\nis not easy; nevertheless, we will speak of it briefly.\r\n\r\nKnow that there are two kinds of knowledge: the knowledge of the essence\r\nof a thing and the knowledge of its qualities. The essence of a thing is\r\nknown through its qualities; otherwise, it is unknown and hidden.\r\n\r\nAs our knowledge of things, even of created and limited things, is\r\nknowledge of their qualities and not of their essence, how is it possible\r\nto comprehend in its essence the Divine Reality, which is unlimited? For\r\nthe inner essence of anything is not comprehended, but only its qualities.\r\nFor example, the inner essence of the sun is unknown, but is understood by\r\nits qualities, which are heat and light. The inner essence of man is\r\nunknown and not evident, but by its qualities it is characterized and\r\nknown. Thus everything is known by its qualities and not by its essence.\r\nAlthough the mind encompasses all things, and the outward beings are\r\ncomprehended by it, nevertheless these beings with regard to their essence\r\nare unknown; they are only known with regard to their qualities.\r\n\r\nThen how can the eternal everlasting Lord, Who is held sanctified from\r\ncomprehension and conception, be known by His essence? That is to say, as\r\nthings can only be known by their qualities and not by their essence, it\r\nis certain that the Divine Reality is unknown with regard to its essence\r\nand is known with regard to its attributes. Besides, how can the\r\nphenomenal reality embrace the Preexistent Reality? For comprehension is\r\nthe result of encompassing--embracing must be, so that comprehension may\r\nbe--and the Essence of Unity surrounds all and is not surrounded.\r\n\r\nAlso the difference of conditions in the world of beings is an obstacle to\r\ncomprehension. For example, this mineral belongs to the mineral kingdom;\r\nhowever far it may rise, it can never comprehend the power of growth. The\r\nplants, the trees, whatever progress they may make, cannot conceive of the\r\npower of sight or the powers of the other senses; and the animal cannot\r\nimagine the condition of man--that is to say, his spiritual powers.\r\nDifference of condition is an obstacle to knowledge; the inferior degree\r\ncannot comprehend the superior degree. How then can the phenomenal reality\r\ncomprehend the Preexistent Reality? Knowing God, therefore, means the\r\ncomprehension and the knowledge of His attributes, and not of His Reality.\r\nThis knowledge of the attributes is also proportioned to the capacity and\r\npower of man; it is not absolute. Philosophy consists in comprehending the\r\nreality of things as they exist, according to the capacity and the power\r\nof man. For the phenomenal reality can comprehend the Preexistent\r\nattributes only to the extent of the human capacity. The mystery of\r\nDivinity is sanctified and purified from the comprehension of the beings,\r\nfor all that comes to the imagination is that which man understands, and\r\nthe power of the understanding of man does not embrace the Reality of the\r\nDivine Essence. All that man is able to understand are the attributes of\r\nDivinity, the radiance of which appears and is visible in the world and\r\nwithin men's souls.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the world and within men's souls, we see wonderful signs\r\nof the divine perfections, which are clear and apparent; for the reality\r\nof things proves the Universal Reality. The Reality of Divinity may be\r\ncompared to the sun, which from the height of its magnificence shines upon\r\nall the horizons; and each horizon, and each soul, receives a share of its\r\nradiance. If this light and these rays did not exist, beings would not\r\nexist; all beings express something and partake of some ray and portion of\r\nthis light. The splendors of the perfections, bounties and attributes of\r\nGod shine forth and radiate from the reality of the Perfect Man--that is to\r\nsay, the Unique One, the supreme Manifestation of God. Other beings\r\nreceive only one ray, but the supreme Manifestation is the mirror for this\r\nSun, which appears and becomes manifest in it, with all its perfections,\r\nattributes, signs and wonders.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the Reality of the Divinity is impossible and\r\nunattainable, but the knowledge of the Manifestations of God is the\r\nknowledge of God, for the bounties, splendors and divine attributes are\r\napparent in Them. Therefore, if man attains to the knowledge of the\r\nManifestations of God, he will attain to the knowledge of God; and if he\r\nbe neglectful of the knowledge of the Holy Manifestations, he will be\r\nbereft of the knowledge of God. It is then ascertained and proved that the\r\nHoly Manifestations are the center of the bounty, signs and perfections of\r\nGod. Blessed are those who receive the light of the divine bounties from\r\nthe enlightened Dawning-points!\r\n\r\nWe hope that the Friends of God, like an attractive force, will draw these\r\nbounties from the source itself, and that they will arise with such\r\nillumination and signs that they will be evident proofs of the Sun of\r\nReality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60: THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SPIRIT (1)\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving shown that the spirit of man exists,(152) we must prove its\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\nThe immortality of the spirit is mentioned in the Holy Books; it is the\r\nfundamental basis of the divine religions. Now punishments and rewards are\r\nsaid to be of two kinds: first, the rewards and punishments of this life;\r\nsecond, those of the other world. But the paradise and hell of existence\r\nare found in all the worlds of God, whether in this world or in the\r\nspiritual heavenly worlds. Gaining these rewards is the gaining of eternal\r\nlife. That is why Christ said, \"Act in such a way that you may find\r\neternal life, and that you may be born of water and the spirit, so that\r\nyou may enter into the Kingdom.\"(153)\r\n\r\nThe rewards of this life are the virtues and perfections which adorn the\r\nreality of man. For example, he was dark and becomes luminous; he was\r\nignorant and becomes wise; he was neglectful and becomes vigilant; he was\r\nasleep and becomes awakened; he was dead and becomes living; he was blind\r\nand becomes a seer; he was deaf and becomes a hearer; he was earthly and\r\nbecomes heavenly; he was material and becomes spiritual. Through these\r\nrewards he gains spiritual birth and becomes a new creature. He becomes\r\nthe manifestation of the verse in the Gospel where it is said of the\r\ndisciples that they \"were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the\r\nflesh, nor of the will of man, but of God\"(154)--that is to say, they were\r\ndelivered from the animal characteristics and qualities which are the\r\ncharacteristics of human nature, and they became qualified with the divine\r\ncharacteristics, which are the bounty of God. This is the meaning of the\r\nsecond birth. For such people there is no greater torture than being\r\nveiled from God, and no more severe punishment than sensual vices, dark\r\nqualities, lowness of nature, engrossment in carnal desires. When they are\r\ndelivered through the light of faith from the darkness of these vices, and\r\nbecome illuminated with the radiance of the sun of reality, and ennobled\r\nwith all the virtues, they esteem this the greatest reward, and they know\r\nit to be the true paradise. In the same way they consider that the\r\nspiritual punishment--that is to say, the torture and punishment of\r\nexistence--is to be subjected to the world of nature; to be veiled from\r\nGod; to be brutal and ignorant; to fall into carnal lusts; to be absorbed\r\nin animal frailties; to be characterized with dark qualities, such as\r\nfalsehood, tyranny, cruelty, attachment to the affairs of the world, and\r\nbeing immersed in satanic ideas. For them, these are the greatest\r\npunishments and tortures.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rewards of the other world are the eternal life which is\r\nclearly mentioned in all the Holy Books, the divine perfections, the\r\neternal bounties and everlasting felicity. The rewards of the other world\r\nare the perfections and the peace obtained in the spiritual worlds after\r\nleaving this world, while the rewards of this life are the real luminous\r\nperfections which are realized in this world, and which are the cause of\r\neternal life, for they are the very progress of existence. It is like the\r\nman who passes from the embryonic world to the state of maturity and\r\nbecomes the manifestation of these words: \"Blessed, therefore, be God, the\r\nmost excellent of Makers.\"(155) The rewards of the other world are peace,\r\nthe spiritual graces, the various spiritual gifts in the Kingdom of God,\r\nthe gaining of the desires of the heart and the soul, and the meeting of\r\nGod in the world of eternity. In the same way the punishments of the other\r\nworld--that is to say, the torments of the other world--consist in being\r\ndeprived of the special divine blessings and the absolute bounties, and\r\nfalling into the lowest degrees of existence. He who is deprived of these\r\ndivine favors, although he continues after death, is considered as dead by\r\nthe people of truth.\r\n\r\nThe logical proof of the immortality of the spirit is this, that no sign\r\ncan come from a nonexisting thing--that is to say, it is impossible that\r\nfrom absolute nonexistence signs should appear--for the signs are the\r\nconsequence of an existence, and the consequence depends upon the\r\nexistence of the principle. So from a nonexisting sun no light can\r\nradiate; from a nonexisting sea no waves appear; from a nonexisting cloud\r\nno rain falls; a nonexisting tree yields no fruit; a nonexisting man\r\nneither manifests nor produces anything. Therefore, as long as signs of\r\nexistence appear, they are a proof that the possessor of the sign is\r\nexistent.\r\n\r\nConsider that today the Kingdom of Christ exists. From a nonexisting king\r\nhow could such a great kingdom be manifested? How, from a nonexisting sea,\r\ncan the waves mount so high? From a nonexisting garden, how can such\r\nfragrant breezes be wafted? Reflect that no effect, no trace, no influence\r\nremains of any being after its members are dispersed and its elements are\r\ndecomposed, whether it be a mineral, a vegetable or an animal. There is\r\nonly the human reality and the spirit of man which, after the\r\ndisintegration of the members, dispersing of the particles, and the\r\ndestruction of the composition, persists and continues to act and to have\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThis question is extremely subtle: consider it attentively. This is a\r\nrational proof which we are giving, so that the wise may weigh it in the\r\nbalance of reason and justice. But if the human spirit will rejoice and be\r\nattracted to the Kingdom of God, if the inner sight becomes opened, and\r\nthe spiritual hearing strengthened, and the spiritual feelings\r\npredominant, he will see the immortality of the spirit as clearly as he\r\nsees the sun, and the glad tidings and signs of God will encompass him.\r\n\r\nTomorrow we will give other proofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61: THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SPIRIT (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday we were occupied in discussing the immortality of the spirit.\r\nKnow that the power and the comprehension of the human spirit are of two\r\nkinds--that is to say, they perceive and act in two different modes. One\r\nway is through instruments and organs: thus with this eye it sees; with\r\nthis ear it hears; with this tongue it talks. Such is the action of the\r\nspirit, and the perception of the reality of man, by means of organs--that\r\nis to say, that the spirit is the seer, through the eyes; the spirit is\r\nthe hearer, through the ear; the spirit is the speaker, through the\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThe other manifestation of the powers and actions of the spirit is without\r\ninstruments and organs. For example, in the state of sleep without eyes it\r\nsees; without an ear it hears; without a tongue it speaks; without feet it\r\nruns. Briefly, these actions are beyond the means of instruments and\r\norgans. How often it happens that it sees a dream in the world of sleep,\r\nand its signification becomes apparent two years afterward in\r\ncorresponding events. In the same way, how many times it happens that a\r\nquestion which one cannot solve in the world of wakefulness is solved in\r\nthe world of dreams. In wakefulness the eye sees only for a short\r\ndistance, but in dreams he who is in the East sees the West. Awake he sees\r\nthe present; in sleep he sees the future. In wakefulness, by means of\r\nrapid transit, at the most he can travel only twenty farsakhs(156) an\r\nhour; in sleep, in the twinkling of an eye, he traverses the East and\r\nWest. For the spirit travels in two different ways: without means, which\r\nis spiritual traveling; and with means, which is material traveling: as\r\nbirds which fly, and those which are carried.\r\n\r\nIn the time of sleep this body is as though dead; it does not see nor\r\nhear; it does not feel; it has no consciousness, no perception--that is to\r\nsay, the powers of man have become inactive, but the spirit lives and\r\nsubsists. Nay, its penetration is increased, its flight is higher, and its\r\nintelligence is greater. To consider that after the death of the body the\r\nspirit perishes is like imagining that a bird in a cage will be destroyed\r\nif the cage is broken, though the bird has nothing to fear from the\r\ndestruction of the cage. Our body is like the cage, and the spirit is like\r\nthe bird. We see that without the cage this bird flies in the world of\r\nsleep; therefore, if the cage becomes broken, the bird will continue and\r\nexist. Its feelings will be even more powerful, its perceptions greater,\r\nand its happiness increased. In truth, from hell it reaches a paradise of\r\ndelights because for the thankful birds there is no paradise greater than\r\nfreedom from the cage. That is why with utmost joy and happiness the\r\nmartyrs hasten to the plain of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn wakefulness the eye of man sees at the utmost as far as one hour of\r\ndistance(157) because through the instrumentality of the body the power of\r\nthe spirit is thus determined; but with the inner sight and the mental eye\r\nit sees America, and it can perceive that which is there, and discover the\r\nconditions of things and organize affairs. If, then, the spirit were the\r\nsame as the body, it would be necessary that the power of the inner sight\r\nshould also be in the same proportion. Therefore, it is evident that this\r\nspirit is different from the body, and that the bird is different from the\r\ncage, and that the power and penetration of the spirit is stronger without\r\nthe intermediary of the body. Now, if the instrument is abandoned, the\r\npossessor of the instrument continues to act. For example, if the pen is\r\nabandoned or broken, the writer remains living and present; if a house is\r\nruined, the owner is alive and existing. This is one of the logical\r\nevidences for the immortality of the soul.\r\n\r\nThere is another: this body becomes weak or heavy or sick, or it finds\r\nhealth; it becomes tired or rested; sometimes the hand or leg is\r\namputated, or its physical power is crippled; it becomes blind or deaf or\r\ndumb; its limbs may become paralyzed; briefly, the body may have all the\r\nimperfections. Nevertheless, the spirit in its original state, in its own\r\nspiritual perception, will be eternal and perpetual; it neither finds any\r\nimperfection, nor will it become crippled. But when the body is wholly\r\nsubjected to disease and misfortune, it is deprived of the bounty of the\r\nspirit, like a mirror which, when it becomes broken or dirty or dusty,\r\ncannot reflect the rays of the sun nor any longer show its bounties.\r\n\r\nWe have already explained that the spirit of man is not in the body\r\nbecause it is freed and sanctified from entrance and exit, which are\r\nbodily conditions. The connection of the spirit with the body is like that\r\nof the sun with the mirror. Briefly, the human spirit is in one condition.\r\nIt neither becomes ill from the diseases of the body nor cured by its\r\nhealth; it does not become sick, nor weak, nor miserable, nor poor, nor\r\nlight, nor small--that is to say, it will not be injured because of the\r\ninfirmities of the body, and no effect will be visible even if the body\r\nbecomes weak, or if the hands and feet and tongue be cut off, or if it\r\nloses the power of hearing or sight. Therefore, it is evident and certain\r\nthat the spirit is different from the body, and that its duration is\r\nindependent of that of the body; on the contrary, the spirit with the\r\nutmost greatness rules in the world of the body; and its power and\r\ninfluence, like the bounty of the sun in the mirror, are apparent and\r\nvisible. But when the mirror becomes dusty or breaks, it will cease to\r\nreflect the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62: PERFECTIONS ARE WITHOUT LIMIT\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow that the conditions of existence are limited to the conditions of\r\nservitude, of prophethood and of Deity, but the divine and the contingent\r\nperfections are unlimited. When you reflect deeply, you discover that also\r\noutwardly the perfections of existence are also unlimited, for you cannot\r\nfind a being so perfect that you cannot imagine a superior one. For\r\nexample, you cannot see a ruby in the mineral kingdom, a rose in the\r\nvegetable kingdom, or a nightingale in the animal kingdom, without\r\nimagining that there might be better specimens. As the divine bounties are\r\nendless, so human perfections are endless. If it were possible to reach a\r\nlimit of perfection, then one of the realities of the beings might reach\r\nthe condition of being independent of God, and the contingent might attain\r\nto the condition of the absolute. But for every being there is a point\r\nwhich it cannot overpass--that is to say, he who is in the condition of\r\nservitude, however far he may progress in gaining limitless perfections,\r\nwill never reach the condition of Deity. It is the same with the other\r\nbeings. A mineral, however far it may progress in the mineral kingdom,\r\ncannot gain the vegetable power. Also in a flower, however far it may\r\nprogress in the vegetable kingdom, no power of the senses will appear. So\r\nthis silver mineral cannot gain hearing or sight; it can only improve in\r\nits own condition and become a perfect mineral, but it cannot acquire the\r\npower of growth, or the power of sensation, or attain to life; it can only\r\nprogress in its own condition.\r\n\r\nFor example, Peter cannot become Christ. All that he can do is, in the\r\ncondition of servitude, to attain endless perfections; for every existing\r\nreality is capable of making progress. As the spirit of man after putting\r\noff this material form has an everlasting life, certainly any existing\r\nbeing is capable of making progress; therefore, it is permitted to ask for\r\nadvancement, forgiveness, mercy, beneficence and blessings for a man after\r\nhis death because existence is capable of progression. That is why in the\r\nprayers of Baha'u'llah forgiveness and remission of sins are asked for\r\nthose who have died. Moreover, as people in this world are in need of God,\r\nthey will also need Him in the other world. The creatures are always in\r\nneed, and God is absolutely independent, whether in this world or in the\r\nworld to come.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the other world is nearness to God. Consequently, it is\r\ncertain that those who are near the Divine Court are allowed to intercede,\r\nand this intercession is approved by God. But intercession in the other\r\nworld is not like intercession in this world. It is another thing, another\r\nreality, which cannot be expressed in words.\r\n\r\nIf a wealthy man at the time of his death bequeaths a gift to the poor and\r\nmiserable, and gives a part of his wealth to be spent for them, perhaps\r\nthis action may be the cause of his pardon and forgiveness, and of his\r\nprogress in the Divine Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAlso a father and mother endure the greatest troubles and hardships for\r\ntheir children; and often when the children have reached the age of\r\nmaturity, the parents pass on to the other world. Rarely does it happen\r\nthat a father and mother in this world see the reward of the care and\r\ntrouble they have undergone for their children. Therefore, children, in\r\nreturn for this care and trouble, must show forth charity and beneficence,\r\nand must implore pardon and forgiveness for their parents. So you ought,\r\nin return for the love and kindness shown you by your father, to give to\r\nthe poor for his sake, with greatest submission and humility implore\r\npardon and remission of sins, and ask for the supreme mercy.\r\n\r\nIt is even possible that the condition of those who have died in sin and\r\nunbelief may become changed--that is to say, they may become the object of\r\npardon through the bounty of God, not through His justice--for bounty is\r\ngiving without desert, and justice is giving what is deserved. As we have\r\npower to pray for these souls here, so likewise we shall possess the same\r\npower in the other world, which is the Kingdom of God. Are not all the\r\npeople in that world the creatures of God? Therefore, in that world also\r\nthey can make progress. As here they can receive light by their\r\nsupplications, there also they can plead for forgiveness and receive light\r\nthrough entreaties and supplications. Thus as souls in this world, through\r\nthe help of the supplications, the entreaties and the prayers of the holy\r\nones, can acquire development, so is it the same after death. Through\r\ntheir own prayers and supplications they can also progress, more\r\nespecially when they are the object of the intercession of the Holy\r\nManifestations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63: THE PROGRESS OF MAN IN THE OTHER WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow that nothing which exists remains in a state of repose--that is to\r\nsay, all things are in motion. Everything is either growing or declining;\r\nall things are either coming from nonexistence into being, or going from\r\nexistence into nonexistence. So this flower, this hyacinth, during a\r\ncertain period of time was coming from the world of nonexistence into\r\nbeing, and now it is going from being into nonexistence. This state of\r\nmotion is said to be essential--that is, natural; it cannot be separated\r\nfrom beings because it is their essential requirement, as it is the\r\nessential requirement of fire to burn.\r\n\r\nThus it is established that this movement is necessary to existence, which\r\nis either growing or declining. Now, as the spirit continues to exist\r\nafter death, it necessarily progresses or declines; and in the other world\r\nto cease to progress is the same as to decline; but it never leaves its\r\nown condition, in which it continues to develop. For example, the reality\r\nof the spirit of Peter, however far it may progress, will not reach to the\r\ncondition of the Reality of Christ; it progresses only in its own\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nLook at this mineral. However far it may evolve, it only evolves in its\r\nown condition; you cannot bring the crystal to a state where it can attain\r\nto sight. This is impossible. So the moon which is in the heavens, however\r\nfar it might evolve, could never become a luminous sun, but in its own\r\ncondition it has apogee and perigee. However far the disciples might\r\nprogress, they could never become Christ. It is true that coal could\r\nbecome a diamond, but both are in the mineral condition, and their\r\ncomponent elements are the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64: THE STATE OF MAN AND HIS PROGRESS AFTER DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we consider beings with the seeing eye, we observe that they are\r\nlimited to three sorts--that is to say, as a whole they are either mineral,\r\nvegetable or animal, each of these three classes containing species. Man\r\nis the highest species because he is the possessor of the perfections of\r\nall the classes--that is, he has a body which grows and which feels. As\r\nwell as having the perfections of the mineral, of the vegetable and of the\r\nanimal, he also possesses an especial excellence which the other beings\r\nare without--that is, the intellectual perfections. Therefore, man is the\r\nmost noble of beings.\r\n\r\nMan is in the highest degree of materiality, and at the beginning of\r\nspirituality--that is to say, he is the end of imperfection and the\r\nbeginning of perfection. He is at the last degree of darkness, and at the\r\nbeginning of light; that is why it has been said that the condition of man\r\nis the end of the night and the beginning of day, meaning that he is the\r\nsum of all the degrees of imperfection, and that he possesses the degrees\r\nof perfection. He has the animal side as well as the angelic side, and the\r\naim of an educator is to so train human souls that their angelic aspect\r\nmay overcome their animal side. Then if the divine power in man, which is\r\nhis essential perfection, overcomes the satanic power, which is absolute\r\nimperfection, he becomes the most excellent among the creatures; but if\r\nthe satanic power overcomes the divine power, he becomes the lowest of the\r\ncreatures. That is why he is the end of imperfection and the beginning of\r\nperfection. Not in any other of the species in the world of existence is\r\nthere such a difference, contrast, contradiction and opposition as in the\r\nspecies of man. Thus the reflection of the Divine Light was in man, as in\r\nChrist, and see how loved and honored He is! At the same time we see man\r\nworshiping a stone, a clod of earth or a tree. How vile he is, in that his\r\nobject of worship should be the lowest existence--that is, a stone or clay,\r\nwithout spirit; a mountain, a forest or a tree. What shame is greater for\r\nman than to worship the lowest existences? In the same way, knowledge is a\r\nquality of man, and so is ignorance; truthfulness is a quality of man; so\r\nis falsehood; trustworthiness and treachery, justice and injustice, are\r\nqualities of man, and so forth. Briefly, all the perfections and virtues,\r\nand all the vices, are qualities of man.\r\n\r\nConsider equally the differences between individual men. The Christ was in\r\nthe form of man, and Caiaphas was in the form of man; Moses and Pharaoh,\r\nAbel and Cain, Baha'u'llah and Yahya,(158) were men.\r\n\r\nMan is said to be the greatest representative of God, and he is the Book\r\nof Creation because all the mysteries of beings exist in him. If he comes\r\nunder the shadow of the True Educator and is rightly trained, he becomes\r\nthe essence of essences, the light of lights, the spirit of spirits; he\r\nbecomes the center of the divine appearances, the source of spiritual\r\nqualities, the rising-place of heavenly lights, and the receptacle of\r\ndivine inspirations. If he is deprived of this education, he becomes the\r\nmanifestation of satanic qualities, the sum of animal vices, and the\r\nsource of all dark conditions.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the mission of the Prophets is to educate men, so that this\r\npiece of coal may become a diamond, and this fruitless tree may be\r\nengrafted and yield the sweetest, most delicious fruits. When man reaches\r\nthe noblest state in the world of humanity, then he can make further\r\nprogress in the conditions of perfection, but not in state; for such\r\nstates are limited, but the divine perfections are endless.\r\n\r\nBoth before and after putting off this material form, there is progress in\r\nperfection but not in state. So beings are consummated in perfect man.\r\nThere is no other being higher than a perfect man. But man when he has\r\nreached this state can still make progress in perfections but not in state\r\nbecause there is no state higher than that of a perfect man to which he\r\ncan transfer himself. He only progresses in the state of humanity, for the\r\nhuman perfections are infinite. Thus, however learned a man may be, we can\r\nimagine one more learned.\r\n\r\nHence, as the perfections of humanity are endless, man can also make\r\nprogress in perfections after leaving this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65: EXPLANATION OF A VERSE IN THE KITAB-I-AQDAS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--It is said in the Kitab-i-Aqdas \"...whoso is deprived thereof,\r\nhath gone astray, though he be the author of every righteous deed.\" What\r\nis the meaning of this verse?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--This blessed verse means that the foundation of success and\r\nsalvation is the knowledge of God, and that the results of the knowledge\r\nof God are the good actions which are the fruits of faith.\r\n\r\nIf man has not this knowledge, he will be separated from God, and when\r\nthis separation exists, good actions have not complete effect. This verse\r\ndoes not mean that the souls separated from God are equal, whether they\r\nperform good or bad actions. It signifies only that the foundation is to\r\nknow God, and the good actions result from this knowledge. Nevertheless,\r\nit is certain that between the good, the sinners and the wicked who are\r\nveiled from God there is a difference. For the veiled one who has good\r\nprinciples and character deserves the pardon of God, while he who is a\r\nsinner, and has bad qualities and character, is deprived of the bounties\r\nand blessings of God. Herein lies the difference.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the blessed verse means that good actions alone, without the\r\nknowledge of God, cannot be the cause of eternal salvation, everlasting\r\nsuccess, and prosperity, and entrance into the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66: THE EXISTENCE OF THE RATIONAL SOUL AFTER THE DEATH OF THE BODY\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--After the body is put aside and the spirit has obtained freedom,\r\nin what way will the rational soul exist? Let us suppose that the souls\r\nwho are assisted by the bounty of the Holy Spirit attain to true existence\r\nand eternal life. But what becomes of the rational souls--that is to say,\r\nthe veiled spirits?(159)\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Some think that the body is the substance and exists by itself,\r\nand that the spirit is accidental and depends upon the substance of the\r\nbody, although, on the contrary, the rational soul is the substance, and\r\nthe body depends upon it. If the accident--that is to say, the body--be\r\ndestroyed, the substance, the spirit, remains.\r\n\r\nSecond, the rational soul, meaning the human spirit, does not descend into\r\nthe body--that is to say, it does not enter it, for descent and entrance\r\nare characteristics of bodies, and the rational soul is exempt from this.\r\nThe spirit never entered this body, so in quitting it, it will not be in\r\nneed of an abiding-place: no, the spirit is connected with the body, as\r\nthis light is with this mirror. When the mirror is clear and perfect, the\r\nlight of the lamp will be apparent in it, and when the mirror becomes\r\ncovered with dust or breaks, the light will disappear.\r\n\r\nThe rational soul--that is to say, the human spirit--has neither entered\r\nthis body nor existed through it; so after the disintegration of the\r\ncomposition of the body, how should it be in need of a substance through\r\nwhich it may exist? On the contrary, the rational soul is the substance\r\nthrough which the body exists. The personality of the rational soul is\r\nfrom its beginning; it is not due to the instrumentality of the body, but\r\nthe state and the personality of the rational soul may be strengthened in\r\nthis world; it will make progress and will attain to the degrees of\r\nperfection, or it will remain in the lowest abyss of ignorance, veiled and\r\ndeprived from beholding the signs of God.\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Through what means will the spirit of man--that is to say, the\r\nrational soul--after departing from this mortal world, make progress?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The progress of man's spirit in the divine world, after the\r\nseverance of its connection with the body of dust, is through the bounty\r\nand grace of the Lord alone, or through the intercession and the sincere\r\nprayers of other human souls, or through the charities and important good\r\nworks which are performed in its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMMORTALITY OF CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the condition of children who die before attaining the\r\nage of discretion or before the appointed time of birth?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--These infants are under the shadow of the favor of God; and as\r\nthey have not committed any sin and are not soiled with the impurities of\r\nthe world of nature, they are the centers of the manifestation of bounty,\r\nand the Eye of Compassion will be turned upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67: ETERNAL LIFE AND ENTRANCE INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nYou question about eternal life and the entrance into the Kingdom. The\r\nouter expression used for the Kingdom is heaven; but this is a comparison\r\nand similitude, not a reality or fact, for the Kingdom is not a material\r\nplace; it is sanctified from time and place. It is a spiritual world, a\r\ndivine world, and the center of the Sovereignty of God; it is freed from\r\nbody and that which is corporeal, and it is purified and sanctified from\r\nthe imaginations of the human world. To be limited to place is a property\r\nof bodies and not of spirits. Place and time surround the body, not the\r\nmind and spirit. Observe that the body of man is confined to a small\r\nplace; it covers only two spans of earth. But the spirit and mind of man\r\ntravel to all countries and regions--even through the limitless space of\r\nthe heavens--surround all that exists, and make discoveries in the exalted\r\nspheres and infinite distances. This is because the spirit has no place;\r\nit is placeless; and for the spirit the earth and the heaven are as one\r\nsince it makes discoveries in both. But the body is limited to a place and\r\ndoes not know that which is beyond it.\r\n\r\nFor life is of two kinds: that of the body and that of the spirit. The\r\nlife of the body is material life, but the life of the spirit expresses\r\nthe existence of the Kingdom, which consists in receiving the Spirit of\r\nGod and becoming vivified by the breath of the Holy Spirit. Although the\r\nmaterial life has existence, it is pure nonexistence and absolute death\r\nfor the holy saints. So man exists, and this stone also exists, but what a\r\ndifference between the existence of man and that of the stone! Though the\r\nstone exists, in relation to the existence of man it is nonexistent.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of eternal life is the gift of the Holy Spirit, as the flower\r\nreceives the gift of the season, the air, and the breezes of spring.\r\nConsider: this flower had life in the beginning like the life of the\r\nmineral; but by the coming of the season of spring, of the bounty of the\r\nclouds of the springtime, and of the heat of the glowing sun, it attained\r\nto another life of the utmost freshness, delicacy and fragrance. The first\r\nlife of the flower, in comparison to the second life, is death.\r\n\r\nThe meaning is that the life of the Kingdom is the life of the spirit, the\r\neternal life, and that it is purified from place, like the spirit of man\r\nwhich has no place. For if you examine the human body, you will not find a\r\nspecial spot or locality for the spirit, for it has never had a place; it\r\nis immaterial. It has a connection with the body like that of the sun with\r\nthis mirror. The sun is not within the mirror, but it has a connection\r\nwith the mirror.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the world of the Kingdom is sanctified from everything\r\nthat can be perceived by the eye or by the other senses--hearing, smell,\r\ntaste or touch. The mind which is in man, the existence of which is\r\nrecognized--where is it in him? If you examine the body with the eye, the\r\near or the other senses, you will not find it; nevertheless, it exists.\r\nTherefore, the mind has no place, but it is connected with the brain. The\r\nKingdom is also like this. In the same way love has no place, but it is\r\nconnected with the heart; so the Kingdom has no place, but is connected\r\nwith man.\r\n\r\nEntrance into the Kingdom is through the love of God, through detachment,\r\nthrough holiness and chastity, through truthfulness, purity,\r\nsteadfastness, faithfulness and the sacrifice of life.\r\n\r\nThese explanations show that man is immortal and lives eternally. For\r\nthose who believe in God, who have love of God, and faith, life is\r\nexcellent--that is, it is eternal; but to those souls who are veiled from\r\nGod, although they have life, it is dark, and in comparison with the life\r\nof believers it is nonexistence.\r\n\r\nFor example, the eye and the nail are living; but the life of the nail in\r\nrelation to the life of the eye is nonexistent. This stone and this man\r\nboth exist; but the stone in relation to the existence of man is\r\nnonexistent; it has no being; for when man dies, and his body is destroyed\r\nand annihilated, it becomes like stone and earth. Therefore, it is clear\r\nthat although the mineral exists, in relation to man it is nonexistent.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the souls who are veiled from God, although they exist in\r\nthis world and in the world after death, are, in comparison with the holy\r\nexistence of the children of the Kingdom of God, nonexisting and separated\r\nfrom God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n68: FATE\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Is the predestination which is mentioned in the Holy Books a\r\ndecreed thing? If so, is not the effort to avoid it useless?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Fate is of two kinds: one is decreed, and the other is conditional\r\nor impending. The decreed fate is that which cannot change or be altered,\r\nand conditional fate is that which may occur. So, for this lamp, the\r\ndecreed fate is that the oil burns and will be consumed; therefore, its\r\neventual extinction is a decree which it is impossible to alter or to\r\nchange because it is a decreed fate. In the same way, in the body of man a\r\npower of life has been created, and as soon as it is destroyed and ended,\r\nthe body will certainly be decomposed, so when the oil in this lamp is\r\nburnt and finished, the lamp will undoubtedly become extinguished.\r\n\r\nBut conditional fate may be likened to this: while there is still oil, a\r\nviolent wind blows on the lamp, which extinguishes it. This is a\r\nconditional fate. It is wise to avoid it, to protect oneself from it, to\r\nbe cautious and circumspect. But the decreed fate, which is like the\r\nfinishing of the oil in the lamp, cannot be altered, changed nor delayed.\r\nIt must happen; it is inevitable that the lamp will become extinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69: THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Have the stars of the heavens any influence upon the human soul,\r\nor have they not?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Some of the celestial stars have a clear and apparent material\r\neffect upon the terrestrial globe and the earthly beings, which needs no\r\nexplanation. Consider the sun, which through the aid and the providence of\r\nGod develops the earth and all earthly beings. Without the light and heat\r\nof the sun, all the earthly creatures would be entirely nonexistent.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the spiritual influence of stars, though this influence of\r\nstars in the human world may appear strange, still, if you reflect deeply\r\nupon this subject, you will not be so much surprised at it. My meaning is\r\nnot, however, that the decrees which the astrologers of former times\r\ninferred from the movements of the stars corresponded to occurrences; for\r\nthe decrees of those former astrologers were forms of imagination which\r\nwere originated by Egyptian, Assyrian and Chaldean priests; nay, rather,\r\nthey were due to the fancies of Hindus, to the myths of the Greeks, Romans\r\nand other star worshipers. But I mean that this limitless universe is like\r\nthe human body, all the members of which are connected and linked with one\r\nanother with the greatest strength. How much the organs, the members and\r\nthe parts of the body of man are intermingled and connected for mutual aid\r\nand help, and how much they influence one another! In the same way, the\r\nparts of this infinite universe have their members and elements connected\r\nwith one another, and influence one another spiritually and materially.\r\n\r\nFor example, the eye sees, and all the body is affected; the ear hears,\r\nand all the members of the body are moved. Of this there is no doubt; and\r\nthe universe is like a living person. Moreover, the connection which\r\nexists between the members of beings must necessarily have an effect and\r\nimpression, whether it be material or spiritual.\r\n\r\nFor those who deny spiritual influence upon material things we mention\r\nthis brief example: wonderful sounds and tones, melodies and charming\r\nvoices, are accidents which affect the air--for sound is the term for\r\nvibrations of the air--and by these vibrations the nerves of the tympanum\r\nof the ear are affected, and hearing results. Now reflect that the\r\nvibration of the air, which is an accident of no importance, attracts and\r\nexhilarates the spirit of man and has great effect upon him: it makes him\r\nweep or laugh; perhaps it will influence him to such a degree that he will\r\nthrow himself into danger. Therefore, see the connection which exists\r\nbetween the spirit of man and the atmospheric vibration, so that the\r\nmovement of the air becomes the cause of transporting him from one state\r\nto another, and of entirely overpowering him; it will deprive him of\r\npatience and tranquillity. Consider how strange this is, for nothing comes\r\nforth from the singer which enters into the listener; nevertheless, a\r\ngreat spiritual effect is produced. Therefore, surely so great a\r\nconnection between beings must have spiritual effect and influence.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that the members and parts of man affect and\r\ninfluence one another. For example, the eye sees; the heart is affected.\r\nThe ear hears; and the spirit is influenced. The heart is at rest; the\r\nthoughts become serene, and for all the members of man's body a pleasant\r\ncondition is realized. What a connection and what an agreement is this!\r\nSince this connection, this spiritual effect and this influence, exists\r\nbetween the members of the body of man, who is only one of many finite\r\nbeings, certainly between these universal and infinite beings there will\r\nalso be a spiritual and material connection. Although by existing rules\r\nand actual science these connections cannot be discovered, nevertheless,\r\ntheir existence between all beings is certain and absolute.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: the beings, whether great or small, are connected with one\r\nanother by the perfect wisdom of God, and affect and influence one\r\nanother. If it were not so, in the universal system and the general\r\narrangement of existence, there would be disorder and imperfection. But as\r\nbeings are connected one with another with the greatest strength, they are\r\nin order in their places and perfect.\r\n\r\nThis subject is worthy of examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70: FREE WILL\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Is man a free agent in all his actions, or is he compelled and\r\nconstrained?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--This question is one of the most important and abstruse of divine\r\nproblems. If God wills, another day, at the beginning of dinner, we will\r\nundertake the explanation of this subject in detail; now we will explain\r\nit briefly, in a few words, as follows. Some things are subject to the\r\nfree will of man, such as justice, equity, tyranny and injustice, in other\r\nwords, good and evil actions; it is evident and clear that these actions\r\nare, for the most part, left to the will of man. But there are certain\r\nthings to which man is forced and compelled, such as sleep, death,\r\nsickness, decline of power, injuries and misfortunes; these are not\r\nsubject to the will of man, and he is not responsible for them, for he is\r\ncompelled to endure them. But in the choice of good and bad actions he is\r\nfree, and he commits them according to his own will.\r\n\r\nFor example, if he wishes, he can pass his time in praising God, or he can\r\nbe occupied with other thoughts. He can be an enkindled light through the\r\nfire of the love of God, and a philanthropist loving the world, or he can\r\nbe a hater of mankind, and engrossed with material things. He can be just\r\nor cruel. These actions and these deeds are subject to the control of the\r\nwill of man himself; consequently, he is responsible for them.\r\n\r\nNow another question arises. Man is absolutely helpless and dependent,\r\nsince might and power belong especially to God. Both exaltation and\r\nhumiliation depend upon the good pleasure and the will of the Most High.\r\n\r\nIt is said in the New Testament that God is like a potter who makes \"one\r\nvessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour.\"(160) Now the dishonored\r\nvessel has no right to find fault with the potter saying, \"Why did you not\r\nmake me a precious cup, which is passed from hand to hand?\" The meaning of\r\nthis verse is that the states of beings are different. That which is in\r\nthe lowest state of existence, like the mineral, has no right to complain,\r\nsaying, \"O God, why have You not given me the vegetable perfections?\" In\r\nthe same way, the plant has no right to complain that it has been deprived\r\nof the perfections of the animal world. Also it is not befitting for the\r\nanimal to complain of the want of the human perfections. No, all these\r\nthings are perfect in their own degree, and they must strive after the\r\nperfections of their own degree. The inferior beings, as we have said,\r\nhave neither the right to, nor the fitness for, the states of the superior\r\nperfections. No, their progress must be in their own state.\r\n\r\nAlso the inaction or the movement of man depend upon the assistance of\r\nGod. If he is not aided, he is not able to do either good or evil. But\r\nwhen the help of existence comes from the Generous Lord, he is able to do\r\nboth good and evil; but if the help is cut off, he remains absolutely\r\nhelpless. This is why in the Holy Books they speak of the help and\r\nassistance of God. So this condition is like that of a ship which is moved\r\nby the power of the wind or steam; if this power ceases, the ship cannot\r\nmove at all. Nevertheless, the rudder of the ship turns it to either side,\r\nand the power of the steam moves it in the desired direction. If it is\r\ndirected to the east, it goes to the east; or if it is directed to the\r\nwest, it goes to the west. This motion does not come from the ship; no, it\r\ncomes from the wind or the steam.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, in all the action or inaction of man, he receives power\r\nfrom the help of God; but the choice of good or evil belongs to the man\r\nhimself. So if a king should appoint someone to be the governor of a city,\r\nand should grant him the power of authority, and should show him the paths\r\nof justice and injustice according to the laws--if then this governor\r\nshould commit injustice, although he should act by the authority and power\r\nof the king, the latter would be absolved from injustice. But if he should\r\nact with justice, he would do it also through the authority of the king,\r\nwho would be pleased and satisfied.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, though the choice of good and evil belongs to man, under\r\nall circumstances he is dependent upon the sustaining help of life, which\r\ncomes from the Omnipotent. The Kingdom of God is very great, and all are\r\ncaptives in the grasp of His Power. The servant cannot do anything by his\r\nown will; God is powerful, omnipotent, and the Helper of all beings.\r\n\r\nThis question has become clearly explained. Salutations!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n71: VISIONS AND COMMUNICATION WITH SPIRITS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Some people believe that they achieve spiritual discoveries--that\r\nis to say, that they converse with spirits. What kind of communion is\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Spiritual discoveries are of two kinds: one kind is of the\r\nimagination and is only the assertion of a few people; the other kind\r\nresembles inspiration, and this is real--such are the revelations of\r\nIsaiah, of Jeremiah and of St. John, which are real.\r\n\r\nReflect that man's power of thought consists of two kinds. One kind is\r\ntrue, when it agrees with a determined truth. Such conceptions find\r\nrealization in the exterior world; such are accurate opinions, correct\r\ntheories, scientific discoveries and inventions.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of conceptions is made up of vain thoughts and useless\r\nideas which yield neither fruit nor result, and which have no reality. No,\r\nthey surge like the waves of the sea of imaginations, and they pass away\r\nlike idle dreams.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, there are two sorts of spiritual discoveries. One is the\r\nrevelations of the Prophets, and the spiritual discoveries of the elect.\r\nThe visions of the Prophets are not dreams; no, they are spiritual\r\ndiscoveries and have reality. They say, for example, \"I saw a person in a\r\ncertain form, and I said such a thing, and he gave such an answer.\" This\r\nvision is in the world of wakefulness, and not in that of sleep. Nay, it\r\nis a spiritual discovery which is expressed as if it were the appearance\r\nof a vision.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of spiritual discoveries is made up of pure imaginations,\r\nbut these imaginations become embodied in such a way that many\r\nsimple-hearted people believe that they have a reality. That which proves\r\nit clearly is that from this controlling of spirits no result or fruit has\r\never been produced. No, they are but narratives and stories.\r\n\r\nKnow that the reality of man embraces the realities of things, and\r\ndiscovers the verities, properties and secrets of things. So all these\r\narts, wonders, sciences and knowledge have been discovered by the human\r\nreality. At one time these sciences, knowledge, wonders and arts were\r\nhidden and concealed secrets; then gradually the human reality discovered\r\nthem and brought them from the realm of the invisible to the plane of the\r\nvisible. Therefore, it is evident that the reality of man embraces things.\r\nThus it is in Europe and discovers America; it is on the earth, and it\r\nmakes discoveries in the heavens. It is the revealer of the secrets of\r\nthings, and it is the knower of the realities of that which exists. These\r\ndiscoveries corresponding to the reality are similar to revelation, which\r\nis spiritual comprehension, divine inspiration and the association of\r\nhuman spirits. For instance, the Prophet says, \"I saw, I said, I heard\r\nsuch a thing.\" It is, therefore, evident that the spirit has great\r\nperception without the intermediary of any of the five senses, such as the\r\neyes or ears. Among spiritual souls there are spiritual understandings,\r\ndiscoveries, a communion which is purified from imagination and fancy, an\r\nassociation which is sanctified from time and place. So it is written in\r\nthe Gospel that, on Mount Tabor, Moses and Elias came to Christ, and it is\r\nevident that this was not a material meeting. It was a spiritual condition\r\nwhich is expressed as a physical meeting.\r\n\r\nThe other sort of converse, presence and communications of spirits is but\r\nimagination and fancy, which only appears to have reality.\r\n\r\nThe mind and the thought of man sometimes discover truths, and from this\r\nthought and discovery signs and results are produced. This thought has a\r\nfoundation. But many things come to the mind of man which are like the\r\nwaves of the sea of imaginations; they have no fruit, and no result comes\r\nfrom them. In the same way, man sees in the world of sleep a vision which\r\nbecomes exactly realized; at another time, he sees a dream which has\r\nabsolutely no result.\r\n\r\nWhat we mean is that this state, which we call the converse and\r\ncommunications of spirits, is of two kinds: one is simply imaginary, and\r\nthe other is like the visions which are mentioned in the Holy Book, such\r\nas the revelations of St. John and Isaiah and the meeting of Christ with\r\nMoses and Elias. These are real, and produce wonderful effects in the\r\nminds and thoughts of men, and cause their hearts to be attracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72: HEALING BY SPIRITUAL MEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Some people heal the sick by spiritual means--that is to say,\r\nwithout medicine. How is this?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Know that there are four kinds of curing and healing without\r\nmedicine. Two are due to material causes, and two to spiritual causes.\r\n\r\nOf the two kinds of material healing, one is due to the fact that in man\r\nboth health and sickness are contagious. The contagion of disease is\r\nviolent and rapid, while that of health is extremely weak and slow. If two\r\nbodies are brought into contact with each other, it is certain that\r\nmicrobic particles will pass from one to the other. In the same way that\r\ndisease is transferred from one body to another with rapid and strong\r\ncontagion, it may be that the strong health of a healthy man will\r\nalleviate a very slight malady in a sick person. That is to say, the\r\ncontagion of disease is violent and has a rapid effect, while that of\r\nhealth is very slow and has a small effect, and it is only in very slight\r\ndiseases that it has even this small effect. The strong power of a healthy\r\nbody can overcome a slight weakness of a sick body, and health results.\r\nThis is one kind of healing.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of healing without medicine is through the magnetic force\r\nwhich acts from one body on another and becomes the cause of cure. This\r\nforce also has only a slight effect. Sometimes one can benefit a sick\r\nperson by placing one's hand upon his head or upon his heart. Why? Because\r\nof the effect of the magnetism, and of the mental impression made upon the\r\nsick person, which causes the disease to vanish. But this effect is also\r\nvery slight and weak.\r\n\r\nOf the two other kinds of healing which are spiritual--that is to say,\r\nwhere the means of cure is a spiritual power--one results from the entire\r\nconcentration of the mind of a strong person upon a sick person, when the\r\nlatter expects with all his concentrated faith that a cure will be\r\neffected from the spiritual power of the strong person, to such an extent\r\nthat there will be a cordial connection between the strong person and the\r\ninvalid. The strong person makes every effort to cure the sick patient,\r\nand the sick patient is then sure of receiving a cure. From the effect of\r\nthese mental impressions an excitement of the nerves is produced, and this\r\nimpression and this excitement of the nerves will become the cause of the\r\nrecovery of the sick person. So when a sick person has a strong desire and\r\nintense hope for something and hears suddenly the tidings of its\r\nrealization, a nervous excitement is produced which will make the malady\r\nentirely disappear. In the same way, if a cause of terror suddenly occurs,\r\nperhaps an excitement may be produced in the nerves of a strong person\r\nwhich will immediately cause a malady. The cause of the sickness will be\r\nno material thing, for that person has not eaten anything, and nothing\r\nharmful has touched him; the excitement of the nerves is then the only\r\ncause of the illness. In the same way the sudden realization of a chief\r\ndesire will give such joy that the nerves will be excited by it, and this\r\nexcitement may produce health.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the complete and perfect connection between the spiritual\r\ndoctor and the sick person--that is, a connection of such a kind that the\r\nspiritual doctor entirely concentrates himself, and all the attention of\r\nthe sick person is given to the spiritual doctor from whom he expects to\r\nrealize health--causes an excitement of the nerves, and health is produced.\r\nBut all this has effect only to a certain extent, and that not always. For\r\nif someone is afflicted with a very violent disease, or is wounded, these\r\nmeans will not remove the disease nor close and heal the wound--that is to\r\nsay, these means have no power in severe maladies, unless the constitution\r\nhelps, because a strong constitution often overcomes disease. This is the\r\nthird kind of healing.\r\n\r\nBut the fourth kind of healing is produced through the power of the Holy\r\nSpirit. This does not depend on contact, nor on sight, nor upon presence;\r\nit is not dependent upon any condition. Whether the disease be light or\r\nsevere, whether there be a contact of bodies or not, whether a personal\r\nconnection be established between the sick person and the healer or not,\r\nthis healing takes place through the power of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73: HEALING BY MATERIAL MEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday at table we spoke of curative treatment and spiritual healing,\r\nwhich consists in treating maladies through the spiritual powers.\r\n\r\nNow let us speak of material healing. The science of medicine is still in\r\na condition of infancy; it has not reached maturity. But when it has\r\nreached this point, cures will be performed by things which are not\r\nrepulsive to the smell and taste of man--that is to say, by aliments,\r\nfruits and vegetables which are agreeable to the taste and have an\r\nagreeable smell. For the provoking cause of disease--that is to say, the\r\ncause of the entrance of disease into the human body--is either a physical\r\none or is the effect of excitement of the nerves.\r\n\r\nBut the principal causes of disease are physical, for the human body is\r\ncomposed of numerous elements, but in the measure of an especial\r\nequilibrium. As long as this equilibrium is maintained, man is preserved\r\nfrom disease; but if this essential balance, which is the pivot of the\r\nconstitution, is disturbed, the constitution is disordered, and disease\r\nwill supervene.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there is a decrease in one of the constituent ingredients of\r\nthe body of man, and in another there is an increase; so the proportion of\r\nthe equilibrium is disturbed, and disease occurs. For example, one\r\ningredient must be one thousand grams in weight, and another five grams,\r\nin order that the equilibrium be maintained. The part which is one\r\nthousand grams diminishes to seven hundred grams, and that which is five\r\ngrams augments until the measure of the equilibrium is disturbed; then\r\ndisease occurs. When by remedies and treatments the equilibrium is\r\nreestablished, the disease is banished. So if the sugar constituent\r\nincreases, the health is impaired; and when the doctor forbids sweet and\r\nstarchy foods, the sugar constituent diminishes, the equilibrium is\r\nreestablished, and the disease is driven off. Now the readjustment of\r\nthese constituents of the human body is obtained by two means--either by\r\nmedicines or by aliments; and when the constitution has recovered its\r\nequilibrium, disease is banished. All the elements that are combined in\r\nman exist also in vegetables; therefore, if one of the constituents which\r\ncompose the body of man diminishes, and he partakes of foods in which\r\nthere is much of that diminished constituent, then the equilibrium will be\r\nestablished, and a cure will be obtained. So long as the aim is the\r\nreadjustment of the constituents of the body, it can be effected either by\r\nmedicine or by food.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the diseases which overtake man also overtake the animal,\r\nbut the animal is not cured by drugs. In the mountains, as in the\r\nwilderness, the animal's physician is the power of taste and smell. The\r\nsick animal smells the plants that grow in the wilderness; he eats those\r\nthat are sweet and fragrant to his smell and taste, and is cured. The\r\ncause of his healing is this. When the sugar ingredient has become\r\ndiminished in his constitution, he begins to long for sweet things;\r\ntherefore, he eats an herb with a sweet taste, for nature urges and guides\r\nhim; its smell and taste please him, and he eats it. The sugar ingredient\r\nin his nature will be increased, and health will be restored.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, evident that it is possible to cure by foods, aliments\r\nand fruits; but as today the science of medicine is imperfect, this fact\r\nis not yet fully grasped. When the science of medicine reaches perfection,\r\ntreatment will be given by foods, aliments, fragrant fruits and\r\nvegetables, and by various waters, hot and cold in temperature.\r\n\r\nThis discourse is brief; but, if God wills, at another time, when the\r\noccasion is suitable, this question will be more fully explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIVE: MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74: THE NONEXISTENCE OF EVIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true explanation of this subject is very difficult. Know that beings\r\nare of two kinds: material and spiritual, those perceptible to the senses\r\nand those intellectual.\r\n\r\nThings which are sensible are those which are perceived by the five\r\nexterior senses; thus those outward existences which the eyes see are\r\ncalled sensible. Intellectual things are those which have no outward\r\nexistence but are conceptions of the mind. For example, mind itself is an\r\nintellectual thing which has no outward existence. All man's\r\ncharacteristics and qualities form an intellectual existence and are not\r\nsensible.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the intellectual realities, such as all the qualities and\r\nadmirable perfections of man, are purely good, and exist. Evil is simply\r\ntheir nonexistence. So ignorance is the want of knowledge; error is the\r\nwant of guidance; forgetfulness is the want of memory; stupidity is the\r\nwant of good sense. All these things have no real existence.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the sensible realities are absolutely good, and evil is\r\ndue to their nonexistence--that is to say, blindness is the want of sight,\r\ndeafness is the want of hearing, poverty is the want of wealth, illness is\r\nthe want of health, death is the want of life, and weakness is the want of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nNevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind--that is, scorpions and serpents\r\nare poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a\r\nscorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man;\r\nbut in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their\r\nweapon, and by their sting they defend themselves. But as the elements of\r\ntheir poison do not agree with our elements--that is to say, as there is\r\nantagonism between these different elements, therefore, this antagonism is\r\nevil; but in reality as regards themselves they are good.\r\n\r\nThe epitome of this discourse is that it is possible that one thing in\r\nrelation to another may be evil, and at the same time within the limits of\r\nits proper being it may not be evil. Then it is proved that there is no\r\nevil in existence; all that God created He created good. This evil is\r\nnothingness; so death is the absence of life. When man no longer receives\r\nlife, he dies. Darkness is the absence of light: when there is no light,\r\nthere is darkness. Light is an existing thing, but darkness is\r\nnonexistent. Wealth is an existing thing, but poverty is nonexisting.\r\n\r\nThen it is evident that all evils return to nonexistence. Good exists;\r\nevil is nonexistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75: TWO KINDS OF TORMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow that there are two kinds of torment: subtile and gross. For example,\r\nignorance itself is a torment, but it is a subtile torment; indifference\r\nto God is itself a torment; so also are falsehood, cruelty and treachery.\r\nAll the imperfections are torments, but they are subtile torments.\r\nCertainly for an intelligent man death is better than sin, and a cut\r\ntongue is better than lying or calumny.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of torment is gross--such as penalties, imprisonment,\r\nbeating, expulsion and banishment. But for the people of God separation\r\nfrom God is the greatest torment of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76: THE JUSTICE AND MERCY OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow that to do justice is to give to everyone according to his deserts.\r\nFor example, when a workman labors from morning until evening, justice\r\nrequires that he shall be paid his wages; but when he has done no work and\r\ntaken no trouble, he is given a gift: this is bounty. If you give alms and\r\ngifts to a poor man although he has taken no trouble for you, nor done\r\nanything to deserve it, this is bounty. So Christ besought forgiveness for\r\nhis murderers: this is called bounty.\r\n\r\nNow the question of the good or evil of things is determined by reason or\r\nby law. Some believe that it is determined by law; such are the Jews, who,\r\nbelieving all the commandments of the Pentateuch to be absolutely\r\nobligatory, regard them as matters of law, not of reason. Thus they say\r\nthat one of the commandments of the Pentateuch is that it is unlawful to\r\npartake of meat and butter together because it is taref, and taref in\r\nHebrew means unclean, as kosher means clean. This, they say, is a question\r\nof law and not of reason.\r\n\r\nBut the theologians think that the good and evil of things depend upon\r\nboth reason and law. The chief foundation of the prohibition of murder,\r\ntheft, treachery, falsehood, hypocrisy and cruelty, is reason. Every\r\nintelligent man comprehends that murder, theft, treachery, falsehood,\r\nhypocrisy and cruelty are evil and reprehensible; for if you prick a man\r\nwith a thorn, he will cry out, complain and groan; so it is evident that\r\nhe will understand that murder according to reason is evil and\r\nreprehensible. If he commits a murder, he will be responsible, whether the\r\nrenown of the Prophet has reached him or not; for it is reason that\r\nformulates the reprehensible character of the action. When a man commits\r\nthis bad action, he will surely be responsible.\r\n\r\nBut in a place where the commands of a Prophet are not known, and where\r\nthe people do not act in conformity with the divine instructions, such as\r\nthe command of Christ to return good for evil, but act according to the\r\ndesires of nature--that is, if they torment those who torment them--from the\r\npoint of view of religion they are excused because the divine command has\r\nnot been delivered to them. Though they do not deserve mercy and\r\nbeneficence, nevertheless, God treats them with mercy and forgives them.\r\n\r\nNow vengeance, according to reason, is also blameworthy, because through\r\nvengeance no good result is gained by the avenger. So if a man strikes\r\nanother, and he who is struck takes revenge by returning the blow, what\r\nadvantage will he gain? Will this be a balm for his wound or a remedy for\r\nhis pain? No, God forbid! In truth the two actions are the same: both are\r\ninjuries; the only difference is that one occurred first, and the other\r\nafterward. Therefore, if he who is struck forgives, nay, if he acts in a\r\nmanner contrary to that which has been used toward him, this is laudable.\r\nThe law of the community will punish the aggressor but will not take\r\nrevenge. This punishment has for its end to warn, to protect and to oppose\r\ncruelty and transgression so that other men may not be tyrannical.\r\n\r\nBut if he who has been struck pardons and forgives, he shows the greatest\r\nmercy. This is worthy of admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77: THE RIGHT METHOD OF TREATING CRIMINALS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Should a criminal be punished, or forgiven and his crime\r\noverlooked?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--There are two sorts of retributory punishments. One is vengeance,\r\nthe other, chastisement. Man has not the right to take vengeance, but the\r\ncommunity has the right to punish the criminal; and this punishment is\r\nintended to warn and to prevent so that no other person will dare to\r\ncommit a like crime. This punishment is for the protection of man's\r\nrights, but it is not vengeance; vengeance appeases the anger of the heart\r\nby opposing one evil to another. This is not allowable, for man has not\r\nthe right to take vengeance. But if criminals were entirely forgiven, the\r\norder of the world would be upset. So punishment is one of the essential\r\nnecessities for the safety of communities, but he who is oppressed by a\r\ntransgressor has not the right to take vengeance. On the contrary, he\r\nshould forgive and pardon, for this is worthy of the world of man.\r\n\r\nThe communities must punish the oppressor, the murderer, the malefactor,\r\nso as to warn and restrain others from committing like crimes. But the\r\nmost essential thing is that the people must be educated in such a way\r\nthat no crimes will be committed; for it is possible to educate the masses\r\nso effectively that they will avoid and shrink from perpetrating crimes,\r\nso that the crime itself will appear to them as the greatest chastisement,\r\nthe utmost condemnation and torment. Therefore, no crimes which require\r\npunishment will be committed.\r\n\r\nWe must speak of things that are possible of performance in this world.\r\nThere are many theories and high ideas on this subject, but they are not\r\npracticable; consequently, we must speak of things that are feasible.\r\n\r\nFor example, if someone oppresses, injures and wrongs another, and the\r\nwronged man retaliates, this is vengeance and is censurable. If the son of\r\n'Amr kills the son of Zayd, Zayd has not the right to kill the son of\r\n'Amr; if he does so, this is vengeance. If 'Amr dishonors Zayd, the latter\r\nhas not the right to dishonor 'Amr; if he does so, this is vengeance, and\r\nit is very reprehensible. No, rather he must return good for evil, and not\r\nonly forgive, but also, if possible, be of service to his oppressor. This\r\nconduct is worthy of man: for what advantage does he gain by vengeance?\r\nThe two actions are equivalent; if one action is reprehensible, both are\r\nreprehensible. The only difference is that one was committed first, the\r\nother later.\r\n\r\nBut the community has the right of defense and of self-protection;\r\nmoreover, the community has no hatred nor animosity for the murderer: it\r\nimprisons or punishes him merely for the protection and security of\r\nothers. It is not for the purpose of taking vengeance upon the murderer,\r\nbut for the purpose of inflicting a punishment by which the community will\r\nbe protected. If the community and the inheritors of the murdered one were\r\nto forgive and return good for evil, the cruel would be continually\r\nill-treating others, and assassinations would continually occur. Vicious\r\npeople, like wolves, would destroy the sheep of God. The community has no\r\nill-will and rancor in the infliction of punishment, and it does not\r\ndesire to appease the anger of the heart; its purpose is by punishment to\r\nprotect others so that no atrocious actions may be committed.\r\n\r\nThus when Christ said: \"Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek,\r\nturn to him the left one also,\"(161) it was for the purpose of teaching\r\nmen not to take personal revenge. He did not mean that, if a wolf should\r\nfall upon a flock of sheep and wish to destroy it, the wolf should be\r\nencouraged to do so. No, if Christ had known that a wolf had entered the\r\nfold and was about to destroy the sheep, most certainly He would have\r\nprevented it.\r\n\r\nAs forgiveness is one of the attributes of the Merciful One, so also\r\njustice is one of the attributes of the Lord. The tent of existence is\r\nupheld upon the pillar of justice and not upon forgiveness. The\r\ncontinuance of mankind depends upon justice and not upon forgiveness. So\r\nif, at present, the law of pardon were practiced in all countries, in a\r\nshort time the world would be disordered, and the foundations of human\r\nlife would crumble. For example, if the governments of Europe had not\r\nwithstood the notorious Attila, he would not have left a single living\r\nman.\r\n\r\nSome people are like bloodthirsty wolves: if they see no punishment\r\nforthcoming, they will kill men merely for pleasure and diversion. One of\r\nthe tyrants of Persia killed his tutor merely for the sake of making\r\nmerry, for mere fun and sport. The famous Mutavakkil, the Abbasid, having\r\nsummoned his ministers, councillors and functionaries to his presence, let\r\nloose a box full of scorpions in the assembly and forbade anyone to move.\r\nWhen the scorpions stung those present, he burst forth into boisterous\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: the constitution of the communities depends upon justice,\r\nnot upon forgiveness. Then what Christ meant by forgiveness and pardon is\r\nnot that, when nations attack you, burn your homes, plunder your goods,\r\nassault your wives, children and relatives, and violate your honor, you\r\nshould be submissive in the presence of these tyrannical foes and allow\r\nthem to perform all their cruelties and oppressions. No, the words of\r\nChrist refer to the conduct of two individuals toward each other: if one\r\nperson assaults another, the injured one should forgive him. But the\r\ncommunities must protect the rights of man. So if someone assaults,\r\ninjures, oppresses and wounds me, I will offer no resistance, and I will\r\nforgive him. But if a person wishes to assault Siyyid Man_sh_adi,(162)\r\ncertainly I will prevent him. Although for the malefactor noninterference\r\nis apparently a kindness, it would be an oppression to Man_sh_adi. If at\r\nthis moment a wild Arab were to enter this place with a drawn sword,\r\nwishing to assault, wound and kill you, most assuredly I would prevent\r\nhim. If I abandoned you to the Arab, that would not be justice but\r\ninjustice. But if he injure me personally, I would forgive him.\r\n\r\nOne thing remains to be said: it is that the communities are day and night\r\noccupied in making penal laws, and in preparing and organizing instruments\r\nand means of punishment. They build prisons, make chains and fetters,\r\narrange places of exile and banishment, and different kinds of hardships\r\nand tortures, and think by these means to discipline criminals, whereas,\r\nin reality, they are causing destruction of morals and perversion of\r\ncharacters. The community, on the contrary, ought day and night to strive\r\nand endeavor with the utmost zeal and effort to accomplish the education\r\nof men, to cause them day by day to progress and to increase in science\r\nand knowledge, to acquire virtues, to gain good morals and to avoid vices,\r\nso that crimes may not occur. At the present time the contrary prevails;\r\nthe community is always thinking of enforcing the penal laws, and of\r\npreparing means of punishment, instruments of death and chastisement,\r\nplaces for imprisonment and banishment; and they expect crimes to be\r\ncommitted. This has a demoralizing effect.\r\n\r\nBut if the community would endeavor to educate the masses, day by day\r\nknowledge and sciences would increase, the understanding would be\r\nbroadened, the sensibilities developed, customs would become good, and\r\nmorals normal; in one word, in all these classes of perfections there\r\nwould be progress, and there would be fewer crimes.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained that among civilized peoples crime is less\r\nfrequent than among uncivilized--that is to say, among those who have\r\nacquired the true civilization, which is divine civilization--the\r\ncivilization of those who unite all the spiritual and material\r\nperfections. As ignorance is the cause of crimes, the more knowledge and\r\nscience increases, the more crimes will diminish. Consider how often\r\nmurder occurs among the barbarians of Africa; they even kill one another\r\nin order to eat each other's flesh and blood! Why do not such savageries\r\noccur in Switzerland? The reason is evident: it is because education and\r\nvirtues prevent them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the communities must think of preventing crimes, rather than of\r\nrigorously punishing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78: STRIKES\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have questioned me about strikes. This question is and will be for a\r\nlong time the subject of great difficulties. Strikes are due to two\r\ncauses. One is the extreme greed and rapacity of the manufacturers and\r\nindustrialists; the other, the excesses, the avidity and intransigence of\r\nthe workmen and artisans. It is, therefore, necessary to remedy these two\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nBut the principal cause of these difficulties lies in the laws of the\r\npresent civilization; for they lead to a small number of individuals\r\naccumulating incomparable fortunes, beyond their needs, while the greater\r\nnumber remain destitute, stripped and in the greatest misery. This is\r\ncontrary to justice, to humanity, to equity; it is the height of iniquity,\r\nthe opposite to what causes divine satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis contrast is peculiar to the world of man: with other creatures--that\r\nis to say, with nearly all animals--there is a kind of justice and\r\nequality. Thus equality exists in a shepherd's flock and in a herd of deer\r\nin the country. Likewise, among the birds of the prairie, of the plain, of\r\nthe hills or of the orchard, and among every kind of animal some kind of\r\nequality prevails. With them such a difference in the means of existence\r\nis not to be found; so they live in the most complete peace and joy.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise with the human species, which persists in the\r\ngreatest error, and in absolute iniquity. Consider an individual who has\r\namassed treasures by colonizing a country for his profit: he has obtained\r\nan incomparable fortune and has secured profits and incomes which flow\r\nlike a river, while a hundred thousand unfortunate people, weak and\r\npowerless, are in need of a mouthful of bread. There is neither equality\r\nnor benevolence. So you see that general peace and joy are destroyed, and\r\nthe welfare of humanity is negated to such an extent as to make fruitless\r\nthe lives of many. For fortune, honors, commerce, industry are in the\r\nhands of some industrialists, while other people are submitted to quite a\r\nseries of difficulties and to limitless troubles: they have neither\r\nadvantages, nor profits, nor comforts, nor peace.\r\n\r\nThen rules and laws should be established to regulate the excessive\r\nfortunes of certain private individuals and meet the needs of millions of\r\nthe poor masses; thus a certain moderation would be obtained. However,\r\nabsolute equality is just as impossible, for absolute equality in\r\nfortunes, honors, commerce, agriculture, industry would end in\r\ndisorderliness, in chaos, in disorganization of the means of existence,\r\nand in universal disappointment: the order of the community would be quite\r\ndestroyed. Thus difficulties will also arise when unjustified equality is\r\nimposed. It is, therefore, preferable for moderation to be established by\r\nmeans of laws and regulations to hinder the constitution of the excessive\r\nfortunes of certain individuals, and to protect the essential needs of the\r\nmasses. For instance, the manufacturers and the industrialists heap up a\r\ntreasure each day, and the poor artisans do not gain their daily\r\nsustenance: that is the height of iniquity, and no just man can accept it.\r\nTherefore, laws and regulations should be established which would permit\r\nthe workmen to receive from the factory owner their wages and a share in\r\nthe fourth or the fifth part of the profits, according to the capacity of\r\nthe factory; or in some other way the body of workmen and the\r\nmanufacturers should share equitably the profits and advantages. Indeed,\r\nthe capital and management come from the owner of the factory, and the\r\nwork and labor, from the body of the workmen. Either the workmen should\r\nreceive wages which assure them an adequate support and, when they cease\r\nwork, becoming feeble or helpless, they should have sufficient benefits\r\nfrom the income of the industry; or the wages should be high enough to\r\nsatisfy the workmen with the amount they receive so that they may\r\nthemselves be able to put a little aside for days of want and\r\nhelplessness.\r\n\r\nWhen matters will be thus fixed, the owner of the factory will no longer\r\nput aside daily a treasure which he has absolutely no need of (for, if the\r\nfortune is disproportionate, the capitalist succumbs under a formidable\r\nburden and gets into the greatest difficulties and troubles; the\r\nadministration of an excessive fortune is very difficult and exhausts\r\nman's natural strength). And the workmen and artisans will no longer be in\r\nthe greatest misery and want; they will no longer be submitted to the\r\nworst privations at the end of their life.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, clear and evident that the repartition of excessive fortunes\r\namong a small number of individuals, while the masses are in need, is an\r\niniquity and an injustice. In the same way, absolute equality would be an\r\nobstacle to life, to welfare, to order and to the peace of humanity. In\r\nsuch a question moderation is preferable. It lies in the capitalists'\r\nbeing moderate in the acquisition of their profits, and in their having a\r\nconsideration for the welfare of the poor and needy--that is to say, that\r\nthe workmen and artisans receive a fixed and established daily wage--and\r\nhave a share in the general profits of the factory.\r\n\r\nIt would be well, with regard to the common rights of manufacturers,\r\nworkmen and artisans, that laws be established, giving moderate profits to\r\nmanufacturers, and to workmen the necessary means of existence and\r\nsecurity for the future. Thus when they become feeble and cease working,\r\nget old and helpless, or leave behind children under age, they and their\r\nchildren will not be annihilated by excess of poverty. And it is from the\r\nincome of the factory itself, to which they have a right, that they will\r\nderive a share, however small, toward their livelihood.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the workmen should no longer make excessive claims and\r\nrevolt, nor demand beyond their rights; they should no longer go out on\r\nstrike; they should be obedient and submissive and not ask for exorbitant\r\nwages. But the mutual and reasonable rights of both associated parties\r\nwill be legally fixed and established according to custom by just and\r\nimpartial laws. In case one of the two parties should transgress, the\r\ncourt of justice should condemn the transgressor, and the executive branch\r\nshould enforce the verdict; thus order will be reestablished, and the\r\ndifficulties, settled. The interference of courts of justice and of the\r\ngovernment in difficulties pending between manufacturers and workmen is\r\nlegal, for the reason that current affairs between workmen and\r\nmanufacturers cannot be compared with ordinary affairs between private\r\npersons, which do not concern the public, and with which the government\r\nshould not occupy itself. In reality, although they appear to be private\r\nmatters, these difficulties between the two parties produce a detriment to\r\nthe public; for commerce, industry, agriculture and the general affairs of\r\nthe country are all intimately linked together. If one of these suffers an\r\nabuse, the detriment affects the mass. Thus the difficulties between\r\nworkmen and manufacturers become a cause of general detriment.\r\n\r\nThe court of justice and the government have, therefore, the right of\r\ninterference. When a difficulty occurs between two individuals with\r\nreference to private rights, it is necessary for a third to settle the\r\nquestion. This is the part of the government. Then the problem of\r\nstrikes--which cause troubles in the country and are often connected with\r\nthe excessive vexations of the workmen, as well as with the rapacity of\r\nmanufacturers--how could it remain neglected?\r\n\r\nGood God! Is it possible that, seeing one of his fellow-creatures\r\nstarving, destitute of everything, a man can rest and live comfortably in\r\nhis luxurious mansion? He who meets another in the greatest misery, can he\r\nenjoy his fortune? That is why, in the Religion of God, it is prescribed\r\nand established that wealthy men each year give over a certain part of\r\ntheir fortune for the maintenance of the poor and unfortunate. That is the\r\nfoundation of the Religion of God and is binding upon all.\r\n\r\nAnd as man in this way is not forced nor obliged by the government, but is\r\nby the natural tendency of his good heart voluntarily and radiantly\r\nshowing benevolence toward the poor, such a deed is much praised, approved\r\nand pleasing.\r\n\r\nSuch is the meaning of the good works in the Divine Books and Tablets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n79: THE REALITY OF THE EXTERIOR WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain sophists think that existence is an illusion, that each being is\r\nan absolute illusion which has no existence--in other words, that the\r\nexistence of beings is like a mirage, or like the reflection of an image\r\nin water or in a mirror, which is only an appearance having in itself no\r\nprinciple, foundation or reality.\r\n\r\nThis theory is erroneous; for though the existence of beings in relation\r\nto the existence of God is an illusion, nevertheless, in the condition of\r\nbeing it has a real and certain existence. It is futile to deny this. For\r\nexample, the existence of the mineral in comparison with that of man is\r\nnonexistence, for when man is apparently annihilated, his body becomes\r\nmineral; but the mineral has existence in the mineral world. Therefore, it\r\nis evident that earth, in relation to the existence of man, is\r\nnonexistent, and its existence is illusory; but in relation to the mineral\r\nit exists.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the existence of beings in comparison with the\r\nexistence of God is but illusion and nothingness; it is an appearance,\r\nlike the image reflected in a mirror. But though an image which is seen in\r\na mirror is an illusion, the source and the reality of that illusory image\r\nis the person reflected, whose face appears in the mirror. Briefly, the\r\nreflection in relation to the person reflected is an illusion.\r\n\r\nThen it is evident that although beings in relation to the existence of\r\nGod have no existence, but are like the mirage or the reflections in the\r\nmirror, yet in their own degree they exist.\r\n\r\nThat is why those who were heedless and denied God were said by Christ to\r\nbe dead, although they were apparently living; in relation to the people\r\nof faith they were dead, blind, deaf and dumb. This is what Christ meant\r\nwhen He said, \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"(163)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n80: REAL PREEXISTENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--How many kinds of preexistence and of phenomena are there?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Some sages and philosophers believe that there are two kinds of\r\npreexistence: essential preexistence and preexistence of time. Phenomena\r\nare also of two kinds, essential phenomena and that of time.\r\n\r\nEssential preexistence is an existence which is not preceded by a cause,\r\nbut essential phenomena are preceded by causes. Preexistence of time is\r\nwithout beginning, but the phenomena of time have beginnings and endings;\r\nfor the existence of everything depends upon four causes--the efficient\r\ncause, the matter, the form and the final cause. For example, this chair\r\nhas a maker who is a carpenter, a substance which is wood, a form which is\r\nthat of a chair, and a purpose which is that it is to be used as a seat.\r\nTherefore, this chair is essentially phenomenal, for it is preceded by a\r\ncause, and its existence depends upon causes. This is called the essential\r\nand really phenomenal.\r\n\r\nNow this world of existence in relation to its maker is a real phenomenon.\r\nAs the body is sustained by the spirit, it is in relation to the spirit an\r\nessential phenomenon. The spirit is independent of the body, and in\r\nrelation to it the spirit is an essential preexistence. Though the rays\r\nare always inseparable from the sun, nevertheless, the sun is preexistent\r\nand the rays are phenomenal, for the existence of the rays depends upon\r\nthat of the sun. But the existence of the sun does not depend upon that of\r\nthe rays, for the sun is the giver and the rays are the gift.\r\n\r\nThe second proposition is that existence and nonexistence are both\r\nrelative. If it be said that such a thing came into existence from\r\nnonexistence, this does not refer to absolute nonexistence, but means that\r\nits former condition in relation to its actual condition was nothingness.\r\nFor absolute nothingness cannot find existence, as it has not the capacity\r\nof existence. Man, like the mineral, is existing; but the existence of the\r\nmineral in relation to that of man is nothingness, for when the body of\r\nman is annihilated it becomes dust and mineral. But when dust progresses\r\ninto the human world, and this dead body becomes living, man becomes\r\nexisting. Though the dust--that is to say, the mineral--has existence in its\r\nown condition, in relation to man it is nothingness. Both exist, but the\r\nexistence of dust and mineral, in relation to man, is nonexistence and\r\nnothingness; for when man becomes nonexistent, he returns to dust and\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\nTherefore, though the world of contingency exists, in relation to the\r\nexistence of God it is nonexistent and nothingness. Man and dust both\r\nexist, but how great the difference between the existence of the mineral\r\nand that of man! The one in relation to the other is nonexistence. In the\r\nsame way, the existence of creation in relation to the existence of God is\r\nnonexistence. Thus it is evident and clear that although the beings exist,\r\nin relation to God and to the Word of God they are nonexistent. This is\r\nthe beginning and the end of the Word of God, Who says: \"I am Alpha and\r\nOmega\"; for He is the beginning and the end of Bounty. The Creator always\r\nhad a creation; the rays have always shone and gleamed from the reality of\r\nthe sun, for without the rays the sun would be opaque darkness. The names\r\nand attributes of God require the existence of beings, and the Eternal\r\nBounty does not cease. If it were to, it would be contrary to the\r\nperfections of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n81: REINCARNATION\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--What is the truth of the question of reincarnation, which is\r\nbelieved by some people?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--The object of what we are about to say is to explain the\r\nreality--not to deride the beliefs of other people; it is only to explain\r\nthe facts; that is all. We do not oppose anyone's ideas, nor do we approve\r\nof criticism.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that those who believe in reincarnation are of two classes:\r\none class does not believe in the spiritual punishments and rewards of the\r\nother world, and they suppose that man by reincarnation and return to this\r\nworld gains rewards and recompenses; they consider heaven and hell to be\r\nrestricted to this world and do not speak of the existence of the other\r\nworld. Among these there are two further divisions. One division thinks\r\nthat man sometimes returns to this world in the form of an animal in order\r\nto undergo severe punishment and that, after enduring this painful\r\ntorment, he will be released from the animal world and will come again\r\ninto the human world; this is called transmigration. The other division\r\nthinks that from the human world one again returns to the human world, and\r\nthat by this return rewards and punishments for a former life are\r\nobtained; this is called reincarnation. Neither of these classes speak of\r\nany other world besides this one.\r\n\r\nThe second sort of believers in reincarnation affirm the existence of the\r\nother world, and they consider reincarnation the means of becoming\r\nperfect--that is, they think that man, by going from and coming again to\r\nthis world, will gradually acquire perfections, until he reaches the\r\ninmost perfection. In other words, that men are composed of matter and\r\nforce: matter in the beginning--that is to say, in the first cycle--is\r\nimperfect, but on coming repeatedly to this world it progresses and\r\nacquires refinement and delicacy, until it becomes like a polished mirror;\r\nand force, which is no other than spirit, is realized in it with all the\r\nperfections.\r\n\r\nThis is the presentation of the subject by those who believe in\r\nreincarnation and transmigration. We have condensed it; if we entered into\r\nthe details, it would take much time. This summary is sufficient. No\r\nlogical arguments and proofs of this question are brought forward; they\r\nare only suppositions and inferences from conjectures, and not conclusive\r\narguments. Proofs must be asked for from the believers in reincarnation,\r\nand not conjectures, suppositions and imaginations.\r\n\r\nBut you have asked for arguments of the impossibility of reincarnation.\r\nThis is what we must now explain. The first argument for its impossibility\r\nis that the outward is the expression of the inward; the earth is the\r\nmirror of the Kingdom; the material world corresponds to the spiritual\r\nworld. Now observe that in the sensible world appearances are not\r\nrepeated, for no being in any respect is identical with, nor the same as,\r\nanother being. The sign of singleness is visible and apparent in all\r\nthings. If all the granaries of the world were full of grain, you would\r\nnot find two grains absolutely alike, the same and identical without any\r\ndistinction. It is certain that there will be differences and distinctions\r\nbetween them. As the proof of uniqueness exists in all things, and the\r\nOneness and Unity of God is apparent in the reality of all things, the\r\nrepetition of the same appearance is absolutely impossible. Therefore,\r\nreincarnation, which is the repeated appearance of the same spirit with\r\nits former essence and condition in this same world of appearance, is\r\nimpossible and unrealizable. As the repetition of the same appearance is\r\nimpossible and interdicted for each of the material beings, so for\r\nspiritual beings also, a return to the same condition, whether in the arc\r\nof descent or in the arc of ascent, is interdicted and impossible, for the\r\nmaterial corresponds to the spiritual.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the return of material beings with regard to species is\r\nevident; so the trees which during former years brought forth leaves,\r\nblossoms and fruits in the coming years will bring forth exactly the same\r\nleaves, blossoms and fruits. This is called the repetition of species. If\r\nanyone makes an objection saying that the leaf, the blossom and the fruit\r\nhave been decomposed, and have descended from the vegetable world to the\r\nmineral world, and again have come back from the mineral world to the\r\nvegetable world, and, therefore, there has been a repetition--the answer is\r\nthat the blossom, the leaf and the fruit of last year were decomposed, and\r\nthese combined elements were disintegrated and were dispersed in space,\r\nand that the particles of the leaf and fruit of last year, after\r\ndecomposition, have not again become combined, and have not returned. On\r\nthe contrary, by the composition of new elements, the species has\r\nreturned. It is the same with the human body, which after decomposition\r\nbecomes disintegrated, and the elements which composed it are dispersed.\r\nIf, in like manner, this body should again return from the mineral or\r\nvegetable world, it would not have exactly the same composition of\r\nelements as the former man. Those elements have been decomposed and\r\ndispersed; they are dissipated in this vast space. Afterward, other\r\nparticles of elements have been combined, and a second body has been\r\nformed; it may be that one of the particles of the former individual has\r\nentered into the composition of the succeeding individual, but these\r\nparticles have not been conserved and kept, exactly and completely,\r\nwithout addition or diminution, so that they may be combined again, and\r\nfrom that composition and mingling another individual may come into\r\nexistence. So it cannot be proved that this body with all its particles\r\nhas returned; that the former man has become the latter; and that,\r\nconsequently, there has been repetition; that the spirit also, like the\r\nbody, has returned; and that after death its essence has come back to this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIf we say that this reincarnation is for acquiring perfections so that\r\nmatter may become refined and delicate, and that the light of the spirit\r\nmay be manifest in it with the greatest perfection, this also is mere\r\nimagination. For, even supposing we believe in this argument, still change\r\nof nature is impossible through renewal and return. The essence of\r\nimperfection, by returning, does not become the reality of perfection;\r\ncomplete darkness, by returning, does not become the source of light; the\r\nessence of weakness is not transformed into power and might by returning,\r\nand an earthly nature does not become a heavenly reality. The tree of\r\nZaqqum,(164) no matter how frequently it may come back, will not bring\r\nforth sweet fruit, and the good tree, no matter how often it may return,\r\nwill not bear a bitter fruit. Therefore, it is evident that returning and\r\ncoming back to the material world does not become the cause of perfection.\r\nThis theory has no proofs nor evidences; it is simply an idea. No, in\r\nreality the cause of acquiring perfections is the bounty of God.\r\n\r\nThe Theosophists believe that man on the arc of ascent(165) will return\r\nmany times until he reaches the Supreme Center; in that condition matter\r\nbecomes a clear mirror, the light of the spirit will shine upon it with\r\nits full power, and essential perfection will be acquired. Now, this is an\r\nestablished and deep theological proposition, that the material worlds are\r\nterminated at the end of the arc of descent, and that the condition of man\r\nis at the end of the arc of descent, and at the beginning of the arc of\r\nascent, which is opposite to the Supreme Center. Also, from the beginning\r\nto the end of the arc of ascent, there are numerous spiritual degrees. The\r\narc of descent is called beginning,(166) and that of ascent is called\r\nprogress.(167) The arc of descent ends in materialities, and the arc of\r\nascent ends in spiritualities. The point of the compass in describing a\r\ncircle makes no retrograde motion, for this would be contrary to the\r\nnatural movement and the divine order; otherwise, the symmetry of the\r\ncircle would be spoiled.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this material world has not such value or such excellence that\r\nman, after having escaped from this cage, will desire a second time to\r\nfall into this snare. No, through the Eternal Bounty the worth and true\r\nability of man becomes apparent and visible by traversing the degrees of\r\nexistence, and not by returning. When the shell is once opened, it will be\r\napparent and evident whether it contains a pearl or worthless matter. When\r\nonce the plant has grown it will bring forth either thorns or flowers;\r\nthere is no need for it to grow up again. Besides, advancing and moving in\r\nthe worlds in a direct order according to the natural law is the cause of\r\nexistence, and a movement contrary to the system and law of nature is the\r\ncause of nonexistence. The return of the soul after death is contrary to\r\nthe natural movement, and opposed to the divine system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, by returning, it is absolutely impossible to obtain existence;\r\nit is as if man, after being freed from the womb, should return to it a\r\nsecond time. Consider what a puerile imagination this is which is implied\r\nby the belief in reincarnation and transmigration. Believers in it\r\nconsider the body as a vessel in which the spirit is contained, as water\r\nis contained in a cup; this water has been taken from one cup and poured\r\ninto another. This is child's play. They do not realize that the spirit is\r\nan incorporeal being, and does not enter and come forth, but is only\r\nconnected with the body as the sun is with the mirror. If it were thus,\r\nand the spirit by returning to this material world could pass through the\r\ndegrees and attain to essential perfection, it would be better if God\r\nprolonged the life of the spirit in the material world until it had\r\nacquired perfections and graces; it then would not be necessary for it to\r\ntaste of the cup of death, or to acquire a second life.\r\n\r\nThe idea that existence is restricted to this perishable world, and the\r\ndenial of the existence of divine worlds, originally proceeded from the\r\nimaginations of certain believers in reincarnation; but the divine worlds\r\nare infinite. If the divine worlds culminated in this material world,\r\ncreation would be futile: nay, existence would be pure child's play. The\r\nresult of these endless beings, which is the noble existence of man, would\r\ncome and go for a few days in this perishable dwelling, and after\r\nreceiving punishments and rewards, at last all would become perfect. The\r\ndivine creation and the infinite existing beings would be perfected and\r\ncompleted, and then the Divinity of the Lord, and the names and qualities\r\nof God, on behalf of these spiritual beings, would, as regards their\r\neffect, result in laziness and inaction! \"Glory to thy Lord, the Lord Who\r\nis sanctified from all their descriptions.\"(168)\r\n\r\nSuch were the limited minds of the former philosophers, like Ptolemy and\r\nthe others who believed and imagined that the world, life and existence\r\nwere restricted to this terrestrial globe, and that this boundless space\r\nwas confined within the nine spheres of heaven, and that all were empty\r\nand void. Consider how greatly their thoughts were limited and how weak\r\ntheir minds. Those who believe in reincarnation think that the spiritual\r\nworlds are restricted to the worlds of human imagination. Moreover, some\r\nof them, like the Druzes and the Nusayris, think that existence is\r\nrestricted to this physical world. What an ignorant supposition! For in\r\nthis universe of God, which appears in the most complete perfection,\r\nbeauty and grandeur, the luminous stars of the material universe are\r\ninnumerable! Then we must reflect how limitless and infinite are the\r\nspiritual worlds, which are the essential foundation. \"Take heed ye who\r\nare endued with discernment.\"(169)\r\n\r\nBut let us return to our subject. In the Divine Scriptures and Holy Books\r\n\"return\" is spoken of, but the ignorant have not understood the meaning,\r\nand those who believed in reincarnation have made conjectures on the\r\nsubject. For what the divine Prophets meant by \"return\" is not the return\r\nof the essence, but that of the qualities; it is not the return of the\r\nManifestation, but that of the perfections. In the Gospel it says that\r\nJohn, the son of Zacharias, is Elias. These words do not mean the return\r\nof the rational soul and personality of Elias in the body of John, but\r\nrather that the perfections and qualities of Elias were manifested and\r\nappeared in John.\r\n\r\nA lamp shone in this room last night, and when tonight another lamp\r\nshines, we say the light of last night is again shining. Water flows from\r\na fountain; then it ceases; and when it begins to flow a second time, we\r\nsay this water is the same water flowing again; or we say this light is\r\nidentical with the former light. It is the same with the spring of last\r\nyear, when blossoms, flowers and sweet-scented herbs bloomed, and\r\ndelicious fruits were brought forth; next year we say that those delicious\r\nfruits have come back, and those blossoms, flowers and blooms have\r\nreturned and come again. This does not mean that exactly the same\r\nparticles composing the flowers of last year have, after decomposition,\r\nbeen again combined and have then come back and returned. On the contrary,\r\nthe meaning is that the delicacy, freshness, delicious perfume and\r\nwonderful color of the flowers of last year are visible and apparent in\r\nexactly the same manner in the flowers of this year. Briefly, this\r\nexpression refers only to the resemblance and likeness which exist between\r\nthe former and latter flowers. The \"return\" which is mentioned in the\r\nDivine Scriptures is this: it is fully explained by the Supreme Pen(170)\r\nin the Kitab-i-Iqan. Refer to it, so that you may be informed of the truth\r\nof the divine mysteries.\r\n\r\nUpon you be greetings and praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n82: PANTHEISM\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--How do the Theosophists and the Sufis understand the question of\r\npantheism?(171) What does it mean, and how nearly does it approximate to\r\nthe truth?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Know that the subject of pantheism is ancient. It is a belief not\r\nrestricted to the Theosophists and the Sufis; on the contrary, some of the\r\nsages of Greece believed in it, like Aristotle, who said, \"The simple\r\ntruth is all things, but it is not any one of them.\" In this case,\r\n\"simple\" is the opposite of \"composed\"; it is the isolated Reality, which\r\nis purified and sanctified from composition and division, and which\r\nresolves Itself into innumerable forms. Therefore, Real Existence is all\r\nthings, but It is not one of the things.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the believers in pantheism think that Real Existence can be\r\ncompared to the sea, and that beings are like the waves of the sea. These\r\nwaves, which signify the beings, are innumerable forms of that Real\r\nExistence; therefore, the Holy Reality is the Sea of Preexistence,(172)\r\nand the innumerable forms of the creatures are the waves which appear.\r\n\r\nLikewise, they compare this theory to real unity and the infinitude of\r\nnumbers; the real unity reflects itself in the degrees of infinite\r\nnumbers, for numbers are the repetition of the real unity. So the number\r\ntwo is the repetition of one, and it is the same with the other numbers.\r\n\r\nOne of their proofs is this: all beings are things known of God; and\r\nknowledge without things known does not exist, for knowledge is related to\r\nthat which exists, and not to nothingness. Pure nonexistence can have no\r\nspecification or individualization in the degrees of knowledge. Therefore,\r\nthe realities of beings, which are the things known of God the Most High,\r\nhave the existence which knowledge has,(173) since they have the form of\r\nthe Divine Knowledge, and they are preexistent, as the Divine Knowledge is\r\npreexistent. As knowledge is preexistent, the things known are equally so,\r\nand the individualizations and the specifications of beings, which are the\r\npreexistent knowledges of the Essence of Unity, are the Divine Knowledge\r\nitself. For the realities of the Essence of Unity, knowledge, and the\r\nthings known, have an absolute unity which is real and established.\r\nOtherwise, the Essence of Unity would become the place of multiple\r\nphenomena, and the multiplicity of preexistences(174) would become\r\nnecessary, which is absurd.\r\n\r\nSo it is proved that the things known constitute knowledge itself, and\r\nknowledge the Essence itself--that is to say, that the Knower, the\r\nknowledge and the things known are one single reality. And if one imagines\r\nanything outside of this, it necessitates coming back to the multiplicity\r\nof preexistences and to enchainment;(175) and preexistences end by\r\nbecoming innumerable. As the individualization and the specification of\r\nbeings in the knowledge of God were the Essence of Unity itself, and as\r\nthere was not any difference between them, there was but one veritable\r\nUnity, and all the things known were diffused and included in the reality\r\nof the one Essence--that is to say, that, according to the mode of\r\nsimplicity and of unity, they constitute the knowledge of God the Most\r\nHigh, and the Essence of the Reality. When God manifested His glory, these\r\nindividualizations and these specifications of beings which had a virtual\r\nexistence--that is to say, which were a form of the Divine Knowledge--found\r\ntheir existence substantiated in the external world; and this Real\r\nExistence resolved Itself into infinite forms. Such is the foundation of\r\ntheir argument.\r\n\r\nThe Theosophists and the Sufis are divided into two branches: one,\r\ncomprising the mass, who, simply in the spirit of imitation, believe\r\npantheism without comprehending the meaning of their renowned savants; for\r\nthe mass of the Sufis believe that the signification of Being is general\r\nexistence, taken substantively, which is comprehended by the reason and\r\nthe intelligence--that is to say, that man comprehends it. Instead of that,\r\nthis general existence is one of the accidents which penetrate the reality\r\nof beings, and the qualities of beings are the essence. This accidental\r\nexistence, which is dependent on beings, is like other properties of\r\nthings which depend on them. It is an accident among accidents, and\r\ncertainly that which is the essence is superior to that which is the\r\naccident. For the essence is the origin, and the accident is the\r\nconsequence; the essence is dependent on itself, and the accident is\r\ndependent on something else--that is to say, it needs an essence upon which\r\nto depend. In this case, God would be the consequence of the creature. He\r\nwould have need of it, and it would be independent of Him.\r\n\r\nFor example, each time that the isolated elements combine conformably to\r\nthe divine universal system, one being among beings comes into the world.\r\nThat is to say, that when certain elements combine, a vegetable existence\r\nis produced; when others combine, it is an animal; again others combine,\r\nand they produce different creatures. In this case, the existence of\r\nthings is the consequence of their reality: how could it be that this\r\nexistence, which is an accident among accidents, and necessitates another\r\nessence upon which it depends, should be the Preexistent Essence, the\r\nAuthor of all things?\r\n\r\nBut the initiated savants of the Theosophists and Sufis, who have studied\r\nthis question, think there are two categories of existence. One is general\r\nexistence, which is understood by the human intelligence; this is a\r\nphenomenon, an accident among accidents, and the reality of the things is\r\nthe essence. But pantheism does not apply to this general and imaginary\r\nexistence, but only to the Veritable Existence, freed and sanctified from\r\nall other interpretation; through It all things exist, and It is the Unity\r\nthrough which all things have come into the world, such as matter, energy\r\nand this general existence which is comprehended by the human mind. Such\r\nis the truth of this question according to the Theosophists and the Sufis.\r\n\r\nBriefly, with regard to this theory that all things exist by the Unity,\r\nall are agreed--that is to say, the philosophers and the Prophets. But\r\nthere is a difference between them. The Prophets say, The Knowledge of God\r\nhas no need of the existence of beings, but the knowledge of the creature\r\nneeds the existence of things known; if the Knowledge of God had need of\r\nany other thing, then it would be the knowledge of the creature, and not\r\nthat of God. For the Preexistent is different from the phenomenal, and the\r\nphenomenal is opposed to the Preexistent; that which we attribute to the\r\ncreature--that is, the necessities of the contingent beings--we deny for\r\nGod; for purification, or sanctification from imperfections, is one of His\r\nnecessary properties. So in the phenomenal we see ignorance; in the\r\nPreexistent we recognize knowledge. In the phenomenal we see weakness; in\r\nthe Preexistent we recognize power. In the phenomenal we see poverty; in\r\nthe Preexistent we recognize wealth. So the phenomenal is the source of\r\nimperfections, and the Preexistent is the sum of perfections. The\r\nphenomenal knowledge has need of things known; the Preexistent Knowledge\r\nis independent of their existence. So the preexistence of the\r\nspecification and of the individualization of beings which are the things\r\nknown of God the Most High does not exist; and these divine and perfect\r\nattributes are not so understood by the intelligence that we can decide if\r\nthe Divine Knowledge has need of things known or not.\r\n\r\nBriefly, this is the principal argument of the Sufis; and if we wished to\r\nmention all their proofs and explain their answers, it would take a very\r\nlong time. This is their decisive proof and their plain argument--at least,\r\nof the savants of the Sufis and the Theosophists.\r\n\r\nBut the question of the Real Existence by which all things exist--that is\r\nto say, the reality of the Essence of Unity through which all creatures\r\nhave come into the world--is admitted by everyone. The difference resides\r\nin that which the Sufis say, \"The reality of the things is the\r\nmanifestation of the Real Unity.\" But the Prophets say, \"it emanates from\r\nthe Real Unity\"; and great is the difference between manifestation and\r\nemanation. The appearance in manifestation means that a single thing\r\nappears in infinite forms. For example, the seed, which is a single thing\r\npossessing the vegetative perfections, which it manifests in infinite\r\nforms, resolving itself into branches, leaves, flowers and fruits: this is\r\ncalled appearance in manifestation; whereas in the appearance through\r\nemanation this Real Unity remains and continues in the exaltation of Its\r\nsanctity, but the existence of creatures emanates from It and is not\r\nmanifested by It. It can be compared to the sun from which emanates the\r\nlight which pours forth on all the creatures; but the sun remains in the\r\nexaltation of its sanctity. It does not descend, and it does not resolve\r\nitself into luminous forms; it does not appear in the substance of things\r\nthrough the specification and the individualization of things; the\r\nPreexistent does not become the phenomenal; independent wealth does not\r\nbecome enchained poverty; pure perfection does not become absolute\r\nimperfection.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: the Sufis admit God and the creature, and say that God\r\nresolves Himself into the infinite forms of the creatures, and manifests\r\nlike the sea, which appears in the infinite forms of the waves. These\r\nphenomenal and imperfect waves are the same thing as the Preexistent Sea,\r\nwhich is the sum of all the divine perfections. The Prophets, on the\r\ncontrary, believe that there is the world of God, the world of the\r\nKingdom, and the world of Creation: three things. The first emanation from\r\nGod is the bounty of the Kingdom, which emanates and is reflected in the\r\nreality of the creatures, like the light which emanates from the sun and\r\nis resplendent in creatures; and this bounty, which is the light, is\r\nreflected in infinite forms in the reality of all things, and specifies\r\nand individualizes itself according to the capacity, the worthiness and\r\nthe intrinsic value of things. But the affirmation of the Sufis requires\r\nthat the Independent Wealth should descend to the degree of poverty, that\r\nthe Preexistent should confine itself to phenomenal forms, and that Pure\r\nPower should be restricted to the state of weakness, according to the\r\nlimitations of contingent beings. And this is an evident error. Observe\r\nthat the reality of man, who is the most noble of creatures, does not\r\ndescend to the reality of the animal, that the essence of the animal,\r\nwhich is endowed with the powers of sensation, does not abase itself to\r\nthe degree of the vegetable, and that the reality of the vegetable, which\r\nis the power of growth, does not descend to the reality of the mineral.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the superior reality does not descend nor abase itself to\r\ninferior states; then how could it be that the Universal Reality of God,\r\nwhich is freed from all descriptions and qualifications, notwithstanding\r\nIts absolute sanctity and purity, should resolve Itself into the forms of\r\nthe realities of the creatures, which are the source of imperfections?\r\nThis is a pure imagination which one cannot conceive.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, this Holy Essence is the sum of the divine perfections;\r\nand all creatures are favored by the bounty of resplendency through\r\nemanation, and receive the lights, the perfection and the beauty of Its\r\nKingdom, in the same way that all earthly creatures obtain the bounty of\r\nthe light of the rays of the sun, but the sun does not descend and does\r\nnot abase itself to the favored realities of earthly beings.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, and considering the lateness of the hour, there is no time\r\nto explain further.\r\n\r\nSalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n83: THE FOUR METHODS OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are only four accepted methods of comprehension--that is to say, the\r\nrealities of things are understood by these four methods.\r\n\r\nThe first method is by the senses--that is to say, all that the eye, the\r\near, the taste, the smell, the touch perceive is understood by this\r\nmethod. Today this method is considered the most perfect by all the\r\nEuropean philosophers: they say that the principal method of gaining\r\nknowledge is through the senses; they consider it supreme, although it is\r\nimperfect, for it commits errors. For example, the greatest of the senses\r\nis the power of sight. The sight sees the mirage as water, and it sees\r\nimages reflected in mirrors as real and existent; large bodies which are\r\ndistant appear to be small, and a whirling point appears as a circle. The\r\nsight believes the earth to be motionless and sees the sun in motion, and\r\nin many similar cases it makes mistakes. Therefore, we cannot trust it.\r\n\r\nThe second is the method of reason, which was that of the ancient\r\nphilosophers, the pillars of wisdom; this is the method of the\r\nunderstanding. They proved things by reason and held firmly to logical\r\nproofs; all their arguments are arguments of reason. Notwithstanding this,\r\nthey differed greatly, and their opinions were contradictory. They even\r\nchanged their views--that is to say, during twenty years they would prove\r\nthe existence of a thing by logical arguments, and afterward they would\r\ndeny it by logical arguments--so much so that Plato at first logically\r\nproved the immobility of the earth and the movement of the sun; later by\r\nlogical arguments he proved that the sun was the stationary center, and\r\nthat the earth was moving. Afterward the Ptolemaic theory was spread\r\nabroad, and the idea of Plato was entirely forgotten, until at last a new\r\nobserver again called it to life. Thus all the mathematicians disagreed,\r\nalthough they relied upon arguments of reason. In the same way, by logical\r\narguments, they would prove a problem at a certain time, then afterward by\r\narguments of the same nature they would deny it. So one of the\r\nphilosophers would firmly uphold a theory for a time with strong arguments\r\nand proofs to support it, which afterward he would retract and contradict\r\nby arguments of reason. Therefore, it is evident that the method of reason\r\nis not perfect, for the differences of the ancient philosophers, the want\r\nof stability and the variations of their opinions, prove this. For if it\r\nwere perfect, all ought to be united in their ideas and agreed in their\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nThe third method of understanding is by tradition--that is, through the\r\ntext of the Holy Scriptures--for people say, \"In the Old and New\r\nTestaments, God spoke thus.\" This method equally is not perfect, because\r\nthe traditions are understood by the reason. As the reason itself is\r\nliable to err, how can it be said that in interpreting the meaning of the\r\ntraditions it will not err, for it is possible for it to make mistakes,\r\nand certainty cannot be attained. This is the method of the religious\r\nleaders; whatever they understand and comprehend from the text of the\r\nbooks is that which their reason understands from the text, and not\r\nnecessarily the real truth; for the reason is like a balance, and the\r\nmeanings contained in the text of the Holy Books are like the thing which\r\nis weighed. If the balance is untrue, how can the weight be ascertained?\r\n\r\nKnow then: that which is in the hands of people, that which they believe,\r\nis liable to error. For, in proving or disproving a thing, if a proof is\r\nbrought forward which is taken from the evidence of our senses, this\r\nmethod, as has become evident, is not perfect; if the proofs are\r\nintellectual, the same is true; or if they are traditional, such proofs\r\nalso are not perfect. Therefore, there is no standard in the hands of\r\npeople upon which we can rely.\r\n\r\nBut the bounty of the Holy Spirit gives the true method of comprehension\r\nwhich is infallible and indubitable. This is through the help of the Holy\r\nSpirit which comes to man, and this is the condition in which certainty\r\ncan alone be attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n84: THE NECESSITY OF FOLLOWING THE TEACHINGS OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Those who are blessed with good actions and universal\r\nbenevolence, who have praiseworthy characteristics, who act with love and\r\nkindness toward all creatures, who care for the poor, and who strive to\r\nestablish universal peace--what need have they of the divine teachings, of\r\nwhich they think indeed that they are independent? What is the condition\r\nof these people?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Know that such actions, such efforts and such words are\r\npraiseworthy and approved, and are the glory of humanity. But these\r\nactions alone are not sufficient; they are a body of the greatest\r\nloveliness, but without spirit. No, that which is the cause of everlasting\r\nlife, eternal honor, universal enlightenment, real salvation and\r\nprosperity is, first of all, the knowledge of God. It is known that the\r\nknowledge of God is beyond all knowledge, and it is the greatest glory of\r\nthe human world. For in the existing knowledge of the reality of things\r\nthere is material advantage, and through it outward civilization\r\nprogresses; but the knowledge of God is the cause of spiritual progress\r\nand attraction, and through it the perception of truth, the exaltation of\r\nhumanity, divine civilization, rightness of morals and illumination are\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nSecond, comes the love of God, the light of which shines in the lamp of\r\nthe hearts of those who know God; its brilliant rays illuminate the\r\nhorizon and give to man the life of the Kingdom. In truth, the fruit of\r\nhuman existence is the love of God, for this love is the spirit of life,\r\nand the eternal bounty. If the love of God did not exist, the contingent\r\nworld would be in darkness; if the love of God did not exist, the hearts\r\nof men would be dead, and deprived of the sensations of existence; if the\r\nlove of God did not exist, spiritual union would be lost; if the love of\r\nGod did not exist, the light of unity would not illuminate humanity; if\r\nthe love of God did not exist, the East and West, like two lovers, would\r\nnot embrace each other; if the love of God did not exist, division and\r\ndisunion would not be changed into fraternity; if the love of God did not\r\nexist, indifference would not end in affection; if the love of God did not\r\nexist, the stranger would not become the friend. The love of the human\r\nworld has shone forth from the love of God and has appeared by the bounty\r\nand grace of God.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the reality of mankind is diverse, that opinions are\r\nvarious and sentiments different; and this difference of opinions, of\r\nthoughts, of intelligence, of sentiments among the human species arises\r\nfrom essential necessity; for the differences in the degrees of existence\r\nof creatures is one of the necessities of existence, which unfolds itself\r\nin infinite forms. Therefore, we have need of a general power which may\r\ndominate the sentiments, the opinions and the thoughts of all, thanks to\r\nwhich these divisions may no longer have effect, and all individuals may\r\nbe brought under the influence of the unity of the world of humanity. It\r\nis clear and evident that this greatest power in the human world is the\r\nlove of God. It brings the different peoples under the shadow of the tent\r\nof affection; it gives to the antagonistic and hostile nations and\r\nfamilies the greatest love and union.\r\n\r\nSee, after the time of Christ, through the power of the love of God, how\r\nmany nations, races, families and tribes came under the shadow of the Word\r\nof God. The divisions and differences of a thousand years were entirely\r\ndestroyed and annihilated. The thoughts of race and of fatherland\r\ncompletely disappeared. The union of souls and of existences took place;\r\nall became true spiritual Christians.\r\n\r\nThe third virtue of humanity is the goodwill which is the basis of good\r\nactions. Certain philosophers have considered intention superior to\r\naction, for the goodwill is absolute light; it is purified and sanctified\r\nfrom the impurities of selfishness, of enmity, of deception. Now it may be\r\nthat a man performs an action which in appearance is righteous, but which\r\nis dictated by covetousness. For example, a butcher rears a sheep and\r\nprotects it; but this righteous action of the butcher is dictated by\r\ndesire to derive profit, and the result of this care is the slaughter of\r\nthe poor sheep. How many righteous actions are dictated by covetousness!\r\nBut the goodwill is sanctified from such impurities.\r\n\r\nBriefly, if to the knowledge of God is joined the love of God, and\r\nattraction, ecstasy and goodwill, a righteous action is then perfect and\r\ncomplete. Otherwise, though a good action is praiseworthy, yet if it is\r\nnot sustained by the knowledge of God, the love of God, and a sincere\r\nintention, it is imperfect. For example, the being of man must unite all\r\nperfections to be perfect. Sight is extremely precious and appreciated,\r\nbut it must be aided by hearing; the hearing is much appreciated, but it\r\nmust be aided by the power of speech; the faculty of speech is very\r\nacceptable, but it must be aided by the power of reason, and so forth. The\r\nsame is true of the other powers, organs and members of man; when all\r\nthese powers, these senses, these organs, these members exist together, he\r\nis perfect.\r\n\r\nNow, today, we meet with people in the world who, in truth, desire the\r\nuniversal good, and who according to their power occupy themselves in\r\nprotecting the oppressed and in aiding the poor: they are enthusiastic for\r\npeace and the universal well-being. Although from this point of view they\r\nmay be perfect, if they are deprived of the knowledge and love of God,\r\nthey are imperfect.\r\n\r\nGalen, the physician, in his book in which he comments on the treatise of\r\nPlato on the art of government,(176) says that the fundamental principles\r\nof religion have a great influence upon a perfect civilization because\r\n\"the multitude cannot understand the connection of explanatory words; so\r\nit has need of symbolical words announcing the rewards and punishments of\r\nthe other world; and that which proves the truth of this affirmation,\" he\r\nsays, \"is that today we see a people called Christians who believe in\r\nrewards and punishments; and this sect show forth beautiful actions like\r\nthose which a true philosopher performs. So we all see clearly that they\r\ndo not fear death, that they expect and desire nothing from the multitude\r\nbut justice and equity, and they are considered as true philosophers.\"\r\n\r\nNow observe what was the degree of the sincerity, the zeal, the spiritual\r\nfeeling, the obligation of friendship, and the good actions of a believer\r\nin Christ, so that Galen, the philosophical physician, although he was not\r\nof the Christian religion, should yet bear witness to the good morals and\r\nthe perfections of these people, to the point of saying that they were\r\ntrue philosophers. These virtues, these morals, were obtained not only\r\nthrough good actions, for if virtue were only a matter of obtaining and\r\ngiving forth good, as this lamp is lighted and illuminates the\r\nhouse--without doubt this illumination is a benefit--then why do we not\r\npraise the lamp? The sun causes all the beings of the earth to increase,\r\nand by its heat and light gives growth and development: is there a greater\r\nbenefit than that? Nevertheless, as this good does not come from goodwill\r\nand from the love and knowledge of God, it is imperfect.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the contrary, a man gives to another a cup of water, the latter\r\nis grateful and thanks him. A man, without reflecting, will say, \"This sun\r\nwhich gives light to the world, this supreme bounty which is apparent in\r\nit, must be adored and praised. Why should we not be grateful and thankful\r\nto the sun for its bounty, when we praise a man who performs a simple act\r\nof kindness?\" But if we look for the truth, we see that this insignificant\r\nkindness of the man is due to conscious feelings which exist; therefore,\r\nit is worthy of praise, whereas the light and heat of the sun are not due\r\nto the feelings and consciousness; therefore, they are not worthy of\r\neulogy or of praise and do not deserve gratitude or thanks.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when a person performs a good action, although it is\r\npraiseworthy, if it is not caused by the love and knowledge of God, it is\r\nimperfect. Moreover, if you reflect justly, you will see that these good\r\nactions of other men who do not know God are also fundamentally caused by\r\nthe teachings of God--that is to say, that the former Prophets led men to\r\nperform these actions, explained their beauty to them, and declared their\r\nsplendid effects; then these teachings were diffused among men and reached\r\nthem successively, one after the other, and turned their hearts toward\r\nthese perfections. When men saw that these actions were considered\r\nbeautiful, and became the cause of joy and happiness for mankind, they\r\nconformed to them.\r\n\r\nWherefore these actions also come from the teachings of God. But justice\r\nis needed to see this, and not controversy and discussion. Praise be to\r\nGod, you have been to Persia, and you have seen how the Persians, through\r\nthe holy breezes of Baha'u'llah, have become benevolent toward humanity.\r\nFormerly, if they met anyone of another race, they tormented him and were\r\nfilled with the utmost enmity, hatred and malevolence; they went so far as\r\nto throw dirt at him. They burned the Gospel and the Old Testament, and if\r\ntheir hands were polluted by touching these books, they washed them. Today\r\nthe greater number of them recite and chant, as is suitable, the contents\r\nof these two Books in their reunions and assemblies, and they expound\r\ntheir esoteric teaching. They show hospitality to their enemies. They\r\ntreat the bloodthirsty wolves with gentleness, like gazelles in the plains\r\nof the love of God. You have seen their customs and habits, and you have\r\nheard of the manners of former Persians. This transformation of morals,\r\nthis improvement of conduct and of words, are they possible otherwise than\r\nthrough the love of God? No, in the name of God. If, by the help of\r\nscience and knowledge, we wished to introduce these morals and customs,\r\ntruly it would take a thousand years, and then they would not be spread\r\nthroughout the masses.\r\n\r\nToday, thanks to the love of God, they are arrived at with the greatest\r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nBe admonished, O possessors of intelligence!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 On the idea of God, cf. \"The Divinity Can Only Be Comprehended\r\n      through the Divine Manifestations,\" p. 146; and \"Man's Knowledge of\r\n      God,\" p. 220.\r\n\r\n      The reader will there see that the Baha'i Faith has not an\r\n      anthropomorphic conception of God, and that if it employs a\r\n      customary terminology, it is careful to explain its symbolic\r\n      meaning.\r\n\r\n    2 Cf.
