The eleven Studies are the\r\nwork of eight different hands, all, with the exception of the editor,\r\nhaving at some period held Fellowships in this University, Dr. Heidel in\r\nGreek, the others in Philosophy. Their names and present pursuits are\r\nindicated in the Table of Contents. The editor has occasionally, though\r\nrarely, added a footnote or phrase which might serve to connect one\r\nStudy more closely with another. The pages in the discussion of\r\nHypothesis, on Mill and Whewell, are by him. With these exceptions, each\r\nwriter is individually and completely responsible for his own Study.\r\n\r\nThe various Studies present, the editor believes, about the relative\r\namount of agreement and disagreement that is natural in view of the\r\nconditions of their origin. The various writers have been in contact\r\nwith one another in Seminars and lecture courses in pursuit of the same\r\ntopics, and have had to do with shaping one another's views. There are\r\nseveral others, not represented in this volume, who have also\r\nparticipated in the evolution of the point of view herein set forth, and\r\nto whom the writers acknowledge their indebtedness. The disagreements\r\nproceed from the diversity of interests with which the different writers\r\napproach the logical topic; and from the fact that the point of view in\r\nquestion is still (happily) developing and showing no signs of becoming\r\na closed system.\r\n\r\nIf the Studies themselves do not give a fair notion of the nature and\r\ndegree of the harmony in the different writers' methods, a preface is\r\nnot likely to succeed in so doing. A few words may be in place, however,\r\nabout a matter repeatedly touched upon, but nowhere consecutively\r\nelaborated--the more ultimate philosophical bearing of what is set\r\nforth. All agree, the editor takes the liberty of saying, that judgment\r\nis the central function of knowing, and hence affords the central\r\nproblem of logic; that since the act of knowing is intimately and\r\nindissolubly connected with the like yet diverse functions of affection,\r\nappreciation, and practice, it only distorts results reached to treat\r\nknowing as a self-inclosed and self-explanatory whole--hence the\r\nintimate connections of logical theory with functional psychology; that\r\nsince knowledge appears as a function within experience, and yet passes\r\njudgment upon both the processes and contents of other functions, its\r\nwork and aim must be distinctively reconstructive or transformatory;\r\nthat since Reality must be defined in terms of experience, judgment\r\nappears accordingly as the medium through which the consciously effected\r\nevolution of Reality goes on; that there is no reasonable standard of\r\ntruth (or of success of the knowing function) in general, except upon\r\nthe postulate that Reality is thus dynamic or self-evolving, and, in\r\nparticular, except through reference to the specific offices which\r\nknowing is called upon to perform in readjusting and expanding the means\r\nand ends of life. And all agree that this conception gives the only\r\npromising basis upon which the working methods of science, and the\r\nproper demands of the moral life, may co-operate. All this, doubtless,\r\ndoes not take us very far on the road to detailed conclusions, but it is\r\nbetter, perhaps, to get started in the right direction than to be so\r\ndefinite as to erect a dead-wall in the way of farther movement of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIn general, the obligations in logical matters of the writers are\r\nroughly commensurate with the direction of their criticisms. Upon the\r\nwhole, most is due to those whose views are most sharply opposed. To\r\nMill, Lotze, Bosanquet, and Bradley the writers then owe special\r\nindebtedness. The editor acknowledges personal indebtedness to his\r\npresent colleagues, particularly to Mr. George H. Mead, in the Faculty\r\nof Philosophy, and to a former colleague, Dr. Alfred H. Lloyd, of the\r\nUniversity of Michigan. For both inspiration and the forging of the\r\ntools with which the writers have worked there is a pre-eminent\r\nobligation on the part of all of us to William James, of Harvard\r\nUniversity, who, we hope, will accept this acknowledgment and this book\r\nas unworthy tokens of a regard and an admiration that are coequal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.

No one doubts that the thinking of everyday practical life\r\nand of science is of this reflective type. We think about; we reflect\r\nover. If we ask what it is which is primary and radical to thought; if\r\nwe ask what is the final objective for the sake of which thought\r\nintervenes; if we ask in what sense we are to understand thought as a\r\nderived procedure, we are plunging ourselves into the very heart of the\r\nlogical problem: the relation of thought to its empirical antecedents\r\nand to its consequent, truth, and the relation of truth to reality.\r\n\r\nYet from the naïve point of view no difficulty attaches to these\r\nquestions. The antecedents of thought are our universe of life and love;\r\nof appreciation and struggle. We think about anything and everything:\r\nsnow on the ground; the alternating clanks and thuds that rise from\r\nbelow; the relation of the Monroe Doctrine to the embroglio in\r\nVenezuela; the relation of art to industry; the poetic quality of a\r\npainting by Botticelli; the battle of Marathon; the economic\r\ninterpretation of history; the proper definition of cause; the best\r\nmethod of reducing expenses; whether and how to renew the ties of a\r\nbroken friendship; the interpretation of an equation in hydrodynamics;\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThrough the madness of this miscellaneous citation there appears so much\r\nof method: anything--event, act, value, ideal, person, or place--may be\r\nan object of thought. Reflection busies itself alike with physical\r\nnature, the record of social achievement, and the endeavors of social\r\naspiration. It is with reference to _such_ affairs that thought is\r\nderivative; it is with reference to them that it intervenes or mediates.\r\nTaking some part of the universe of action, of affection, of social\r\nconstruction, under its special charge, and having busied itself\r\ntherewith sufficiently to meet the special difficulty presented, thought\r\nreleases that topic and enters upon further more direct experience.\r\n\r\nSticking for a moment to this naïve standpoint, we recognize a certain\r\nrhythm of direct practice and derived theory; of primary construction\r\nand of secondary criticism; of living appreciation and of abstract\r\ndescription; of active endeavor and of pale reflection. We find that\r\nevery more direct primary attitude passes upon occasion into its\r\nsecondary deliberative and discursive counterpart. We find that when the\r\nlatter has done its work it passes away and passes on. From the naïve\r\nstandpoint such rhythm is taken as a matter of course. There is no\r\nattempt to state either the nature of the occasion which demands the\r\nthinking attitude, nor to formulate a theory of the standard by which is\r\njudged its success. No general theory is propounded as to the exact\r\nrelationship between thinking and what antecedes and succeeds it. Much\r\nless do we ask how empirical circumstances can generate rationality of\r\nthought; nor how it is possible for reflection to lay claim to power of\r\ndetermining truth and thereby of constructing further reality.\r\n\r\nIf we were to ask the thinking of naïve life to present, with a minimum\r\nof theoretical elaboration, its conception of its own practice, we\r\nshould get an answer running not unlike this: Thinking is a kind of\r\nactivity which we perform at specific need, just as at other need we\r\nengage in other sorts of activity: as converse with a friend; draw a\r\nplan for a house; take a walk; eat a dinner; purchase a suit of\r\nclothes; etc., etc. In general, its material is anything in the wide\r\nuniverse which seems to be relevant to this need--anything which may\r\nserve as a resource in defining the difficulty or in suggesting modes of\r\ndealing effectively with it. The measure of its success, the standard of\r\nits validity, is precisely the degree in which the thinking actually\r\ndisposes of the difficulty and allows us to proceed with more direct\r\nmodes of experiencing, that are forthwith possessed of more assured and\r\ndeepened value.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire why the naïve attitude does not go on to elaborate these\r\nimplications of its own practice into a systematic theory, the answer,\r\non its own basis, is obvious. Thought arises in response to its own\r\noccasion. And this occasion is so exacting that there is time, as there\r\nis need, only to do the thinking which is needed in that occasion--not\r\nto reflect upon the thinking itself. Reflection follows so naturally\r\nupon its appropriate cue, its issue is so obvious, so practical, the\r\nentire relationship is so organic, that once grant the position that\r\nthought arises in reaction to specific demand, and there is not the\r\nparticular type of thinking called logical theory because there is not\r\nthe practical demand for reflection of that sort. Our attention is taken\r\nup with particular questions and specific answers. What we have to\r\nreckon with is not the problem of, How can I think _überhaupt_? but, How\r\nshall I think right _here and now_? Not what is the test of thought at\r\nlarge, but what validates and confirms _this_ thought?\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this view, it follows that a generic account of our\r\nthinking behavior, the generic account termed logical theory, arises at\r\nhistoric periods in which the situation has lost the organic character\r\nabove described. The general theory of reflection, as over against its\r\nconcrete exercise, appears when occasions for reflection are so\r\noverwhelming and so mutually conflicting that specific adequate\r\nresponse in thought is blocked. Again, it shows itself when practical\r\naffairs are so multifarious, complicated, and remote from control that\r\nthinking is held off from successful passage into them.\r\n\r\nAnyhow (sticking to the naïve standpoint), it is true that the stimulus\r\nto that particular form of reflective thinking termed logical theory is\r\nfound when circumstances require the act of thinking and nevertheless\r\nimpede clear and coherent thinking in detail; or when they occasion\r\nthought and then prevent the results of thinking from exercising\r\ndirective influence upon the immediate concerns of life. Under these\r\nconditions we get such questions as the following: What is the relation\r\nof rational thought to crude or unreflective experience? What is the\r\nrelation of thought to reality? What is the barrier which prevents\r\nreason from complete penetration into the world of truth? What is it\r\nthat makes us live alternately in a concrete world of experience in\r\nwhich thought as such finds not satisfaction, and in a world of ordered\r\nthought which is yet only abstract and ideal?\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention here to pursue the line of historical inquiry\r\nthus suggested. Indeed, the point would not be mentioned did it not\r\nserve to fix attention upon the nature of the logical problem.\r\n\r\nIt is in dealing with this latter type of questions that logical theory\r\nhas taken a turn which separates it widely from the theoretical\r\nimplications of practical deliberation and of scientific research. The\r\ntwo latter, however much they differ from each other in detail, agree in\r\na fundamental principle. They both assume that every reflective problem\r\nand operation arises with reference to some _specific_ situation, and\r\nhas to subserve a _specific_ purpose dependent upon its own occasion.\r\nThey assume and observe distinct limits--limits from which and to which.\r\nThere is the limit of origin in the needs of the particular situation\r\nwhich evokes reflection. There is the limit of terminus in successful\r\ndealing with the particular problem presented--or in retiring, baffled,\r\nto take up some other question. The query that at once faces us\r\nregarding the nature of logical theory is whether reflection upon\r\nreflection shall recognize these limits, endeavoring to formulate them\r\nmore exactly and to define their relationships to each other more\r\nadequately; or shall it abolish limits, do away with the matter of\r\nspecific conditions and specific aims of thought, and discuss thought\r\nand its relation to empirical antecedents and rational consequents\r\n(truth) at large?\r\n\r\nAt first blush, it might seem as if the very nature of logical theory as\r\ngeneralization of the reflective process must of necessity disregard the\r\nmatter of particular conditions and particular results as irrelevant.\r\nHow, the implication runs, could reflection become generalized save by\r\nelimination of details as irrelevant? Such a conception in fixing the\r\ncentral problem of logic fixes once for all its future career and\r\nmaterial. The essential business of logic is henceforth to discuss the\r\nrelation of thought as such to reality as such. It may, indeed, involve\r\nmuch psychological material, particularly in the discussion of the\r\nprocesses which antecede thinking and which call it out. It may involve\r\nmuch discussion of the concrete methods of investigation and\r\nverification employed in the various sciences. It may busily concern\r\nitself with the differentiation of various types and forms of\r\nthought--different modes of conceiving, various conformations of\r\njudgment, various types of inferential reasoning. But it concerns itself\r\nwith any and all of these three fields, not on their own account or as\r\nultimate, but as subsidiary to the main problem: the relation of thought\r\nas such, or at large, to reality as such, or at large. Some of the\r\ndetailed considerations referred to may throw light upon the terms under\r\nwhich thought transacts its business with reality; upon, say, certain\r\npeculiar limitations it has to submit to as best it may. Other\r\nconsiderations throw light upon the ways in which thought gets at\r\nreality. Still other considerations throw light upon the forms which\r\nthought assumes in attacking and apprehending reality. But in the end\r\nall this is incidental. In the end the one problem holds: How do the\r\nspecifications of thought as such hold good of reality as such? In fine,\r\nlogic is supposed to grow out of the epistemological inquiry and to lead\r\nup to its solution.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view various aspects of logical theory are well\r\nstated by an author whom later on we shall consider in some detail.\r\nLotze[1] refers to \"universal forms and principles of thought which hold\r\ngood everywhere both in judging of reality and in weighing possibility,\r\n_irrespective of any difference in the objects_.\" This defines the\r\nbusiness of _pure_ logic. This is clearly the question of thought as\r\nsuch--of thought at large or in general. Then we have the question \"of\r\nhow far the most complete structure of thought ... can claim to be an\r\nadequate account of that which we seem compelled to assume as the object\r\nand occasion of our ideas.\" This is clearly the question of the relation\r\nof thought at large to reality at large. It is epistemology. Then comes\r\n\"applied logic,\" having to do with the actual employment of concrete\r\nforms of thought with reference to investigation of specific topics and\r\nsubjects. This \"applied\" logic would, if the standpoint of practical\r\ndeliberation and of scientific research were adopted, be the sole\r\ngenuine logic. But the existence of thought _in itself_ having been\r\nagreed upon, we have in this \"applied\" logic only an incidental inquiry\r\nof how the particular resistances and oppositions which \"pure\" thought\r\nmeets from particular matters may best be discounted. It is concerned\r\nwith methods of investigation which obviate defects in the relationship\r\nof thought at large to reality at large, as these present themselves\r\nunder the limitations of human experience. It deals merely with\r\nhindrances, and with devices for overcoming them; it is directed by\r\nconsiderations of utility. When we reflect that this field includes the\r\nentire procedure of practical deliberation and of concrete scientific\r\nresearch, we begin to realize something of the significance of the\r\ntheory of logic which regards the limitations of specific origination\r\nand specific outcome as irrelevant to its main problem, which assumes an\r\nactivity of thought \"pure\" or \"in itself,\" that is, \"irrespective of any\r\ndifference in its objects.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggests, by contrast, the opposite mode of stating the problem of\r\nlogical theory. Generalization of the nature of the reflective process\r\ncertainly involves elimination of much of the specific material and\r\ncontents of the thought-situations of daily life and of critical\r\nscience. Quite compatible with this, however, is the notion that it\r\nseizes upon _certain_ specific conditions and factors, and aims to bring\r\nthem to clear consciousness--not to abolish them. While eliminating the\r\nparticular material of particular practical and scientific pursuits,\r\n(1) it may strive to hit upon the common denominator in the various\r\nsituations which are antecedent or primary to thought and which evoke\r\nit; (2) it may attempt to show how typical features in the specific\r\nantecedents of thought call out to diverse typical modes of\r\nthought-reaction; (3) it may attempt to state the nature of the specific\r\nconsequences in which thought fulfils its career.\r\n\r\n(1) It does not eliminate dependence upon specific occasions as\r\nprovocative of thought; but endeavors to define _what_ in the various\r\nsituations constitutes them thought-provoking. The specific occasion is\r\nnot eliminated, but insisted upon and brought into the foreground.\r\nConsequently psychological considerations are not subsidiary incidents,\r\nbut of essential importance so far as they enable us to trace the\r\ngeneration of the thought-situation. (2) So from this point of view the\r\nvarious types and modes of conceiving, judging, and inference are\r\ntreated, not as qualifications of thought per se or at large, but of\r\nthought engaged in its specific, most economic, effective response to\r\nits own particular occasion; they are adaptations for control of\r\nstimuli. The distinctions and classifications that have been accumulated\r\nin \"formal\" logic are relevant data; but they demand interpretation from\r\nthe standpoint of use as organs of adjustment to material antecedents\r\nand stimuli. (3) Finally the question of validity, or ultimate objective\r\nof thought, is relevant; but is such as a matter of the specific issue\r\nof the specific career of a thought-function. All the typical\r\ninvestigatory and verificatory procedures of the various sciences are\r\ninherently concerned as indicating the ways in which thought actually\r\nbrings itself to its own successful fulfilment in dealing with various\r\ntypes of problems.\r\n\r\nWhile the epistemological type of logic may, as we have seen, leave\r\n(under the name of applied logic), a subsidiary place open for the\r\ninstrumental type, the type which deals with thinking as a specific\r\nprocedure relative to a specific antecedent occasion and to a subsequent\r\nspecific fulfilment, is not able to reciprocate the favor. From its\r\npoint of view, an attempt to discuss the antecedents, data, forms, and\r\nobjective of thought, apart from reference to particular position\r\noccupied, and particular part played in the growth of experience is to\r\nreach results which are not so much either true or false as they are\r\nradically meaningless--because they are considered apart from limits.\r\nIts results are not only abstractions (for all theorizing ends in\r\nabstractions), but abstractions without possible reference or bearing.\r\nFrom this point of view, the taking of something, whether that something\r\nbe thinking activity, its empirical condition, or its objective goal,\r\napart from the limits of a historic or developing situation, is the\r\nessence of _metaphysical_ procedure--in the sense of metaphysics which\r\nmakes a gulf between it and science.\r\n\r\nAs the reader has doubtless anticipated, it is the object of this\r\nchapter to present the problem and industry of reflective thought from\r\nthis latter point of view. I recur again to the standpoint of naïve\r\nexperience, using the term in a sense wide enough to cover both\r\npractical procedure and concrete scientific research. I resume by saying\r\nthat this point of view knows no fixed distinction between the empirical\r\nvalues of unreflective life and the most abstract process of rational\r\nthought. It knows no fixed gulf between the highest flight of theory and\r\ncontrol of the details of practical construction and behavior. It\r\npasses, according to the occasion and opportunity of the moment, from\r\nthe attitude of loving and struggling and doing to that of thinking and\r\nthe reverse. Its contents or material shift their values back and forth\r\nfrom technological or utilitarian to æsthetic, ethic, or affectional. It\r\nutilizes data of perception or of discursive ideation as need calls,\r\njust as an inventor now utilizes heat, now mechanical strain, now\r\nelectricity, according to the demands set by his aim. From this point of\r\nview, more definite logical import is attached to our earlier statements\r\n(p. 2) regarding the possibility of taking anything in the universe of\r\nexperience as subject-matter of thought. Anything from past experience\r\nmay be taken which appears to be an element in either the statement or\r\nthe solution of the present problem. Thus we understand the coexistence\r\nwithout contradiction of an indeterminate possible field and a limited\r\nactual field. The undefined set of means becomes specific through\r\nreference to an end.\r\n\r\nIn all this, there is no difference of kind between the methods of\r\nscience and those of the plain man. The difference is the greater\r\ncontrol in science of the statement of the problem, and of the\r\nselection and use of relevant material, both sensible or ideational. The\r\ntwo are related to each other just as the hit-or-miss, trial-and-error\r\ninventions of uncivilized man stand to the deliberate and consecutively\r\npersistent efforts of a modern inventor to produce a certain complicated\r\ndevice for doing a comprehensive piece of work. Neither the plain man\r\nnor the scientific inquirer is aware, as he engages in his reflective\r\nactivity, of any transition from one sphere of existence to another. He\r\nknows no two fixed worlds--reality on one side and mere subjective ideas\r\non the other; he is aware of no gulf to cross. He assumes uninterrupted,\r\nfree, and fluid passage from ordinary experience to abstract thinking,\r\nfrom thought to fact, from things to theories and back again.\r\nObservation passes into development of hypothesis; deductive methods\r\npass to use in description of the particular; inference passes into\r\naction with no sense of difficulty save those found in the particular\r\ntask in question. The fundamental assumption is _continuity_ in and of\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that fact is confused with idea, or observed datum\r\nwith voluntary hypothesis, theory with doing, any more than a traveler\r\nconfuses land and water when he journeys from one to the other. It\r\nsimply means that each is placed and used with reference to service\r\nrendered the other, and with reference to future use of the other.\r\n\r\nOnly the epistemological spectator is aware of the fact that the\r\neveryday man and the scientific man in this free and easy intercourse\r\nare rashly assuming the right to glide over a cleft in the very\r\nstructure of reality. This fact raises a query not favorable to the\r\nepistemologist. Why is it that the scientific man, who is constantly\r\nplying his venturous traffic of exchange of facts for ideas, of theories\r\nfor laws, of real things for hypotheses, should be so wholly unaware of\r\nthe radical and generic (as distinct from specific) difficulty of the\r\nundertakings in which he is engaged? We thus come afresh to our inquiry:\r\nDoes not the epistemological logician unwittingly transfer the specific\r\ndifficulty which always faces the scientific man--the difficulty in\r\ndetail of correct and adequate translation back and forth of _this_ set\r\nof facts and _this_ group of ideas--into a totally different problem of\r\nthe wholesale relation of thought at large with reality in general? If\r\nsuch be the case, it is clear that the very way in which the\r\nepistemological type of logic states the problem of thinking, in\r\nrelation both to empirical antecedents and to objective truth, makes\r\nthat problem insoluble. Working terms, terms which as working are\r\nflexible and historic, relative, are transformed into absolute, fixed,\r\nand predetermined forms of being.\r\n\r\nWe come a little closer to the problem when we recognize that every\r\nscientific inquiry passes historically through at least four stages.\r\n(_a_) The first of these stages is, if I may be allowed the bull, that\r\nin which scientific inquiry does not take place at all, because no\r\nproblem or difficulty in the quality of the experience has presented\r\nitself to provoke reflection. We have only to cast our eye back from the\r\nexisting status of any science, or back from the status of any\r\nparticular topic in any science, to discover a time when no reflective\r\nor critical thinking busied itself with the matter--when the facts and\r\nrelations were taken for granted and thus were lost and absorbed in the\r\nvalue which accrued from the experience. (_b_) After the dawning of the\r\nproblem, there comes a period of occupation with relatively crude and\r\nunorganized facts--the hunting for, locating, and collecting of raw\r\nmaterial. This is the empiric stage, which no existing science, however\r\nproud in its attained rationality, can disavow as its own progenitor.\r\n(_c_) Then there is also a speculative stage: a period of guessing, of\r\nmaking hypotheses, of framing ideas which later on are labeled and\r\ncondemned as only ideas. There is a period of distinction and\r\nclassification-making which later on is regarded as only\r\nmentally-gymnastic in character. And no science, however proud in its\r\npresent security of experimental assurance, can disavow a scholastic\r\nancestor. (_d_) Finally, there comes a period of fruitful interaction\r\nbetween the mere ideas and the mere facts: a period when observation is\r\ndetermined by experimental conditions depending upon the use of certain\r\nguiding conceptions; when reflection is directed and checked at every\r\npoint by the use of experimental data, and by the necessity of finding\r\nsuch form for itself as will enable it to serve as premise in a\r\ndeduction leading to evolution of new meanings, and ultimately to\r\nexperimental inquiry, which brings to light new facts. In the emerging\r\nof a more orderly and significant region of fact, and of a more coherent\r\nand self-luminous system of meaning, we have the natural limit of\r\nevolution of the logic of a given science.\r\n\r\nBut consider what has happened in this historic record. Unanalyzed\r\nexperience has broken up into distinctions of facts and ideas; the\r\nfactual side has been developed by indefinite and almost miscellaneous\r\ndescriptions and cumulative listings; the conceptual side has been\r\ndeveloped by unchecked and speculative elaboration of definitions,\r\nclassifications, etc. There has been a relegation of accepted meanings\r\nto the limbo of mere ideas; there has been a passage of some of the\r\naccepted facts into the region of mere hypothesis and opinion.\r\nConversely, there has been a continued issuing of ideas from the region\r\nof hypotheses and theories into that of facts, of accepted objective and\r\nmeaningful contents. Out of a world of only _seeming_ facts, and of only\r\n_doubtful_ ideas, there emerges a universe continually growing in\r\ndefiniteness, order, and luminosity.\r\n\r\nThis progress, verified in every record of science, is an absolute\r\nmonstrosity from the standpoint of the epistemology which assumes a\r\nthought in general, on one side, and a reality in general, on the other.\r\nThe reason that it does not present itself as such a monster and miracle\r\nto those actually concerned with it is because there is a certain\r\n_homogeneity_ or _continuity_ of reference and of use which controls all\r\ndiversities in both the modes of existence specified and the grades of\r\nvalue assigned. The distinction of thought and fact is treated in the\r\ngrowth of a science, or of any particular scientific problem, as an\r\n_induced_ and _intentional_ practical division of labor; as relative\r\nassignments of position with reference to performance of a task; as\r\ndeliberate distribution of forces at command for their more economic\r\nuse. The interaction of bald fact and hypothetical idea into the outcome\r\nof a single world of scientific apprehension and comprehension is but\r\nthe successful achieving of the aim on account of which the distinctions\r\nin question were instituted.\r\n\r\nThus we come back to the problem of logical theory. To take the\r\ndistinctions of thought and fact, etc., as ontological, as inherently\r\nfixed in the make-up of the structure of being, is to treat the actual\r\ndevelopment of scientific inquiry and scientific control as a mere\r\nsubsidiary topic ultimately of only utilitarian worth. It is also to\r\nstate the terms upon which thought and being transact business in a way\r\nso totally alien to the use made of these distinctions in concrete\r\nexperience as to create a problem which can be discussed only in terms\r\nof itself--not in terms of the conduct of life--metaphysics again in the\r\nbad sense of that term. As against this, the problem of a logic which\r\naligns itself with the origin and employ of reflective thought in\r\neveryday life and in critical science, is to follow the natural history\r\nof thinking as a life-process having its own generating antecedents and\r\nstimuli, its own states and career, and its own specific objective or\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nThis point of view makes it possible for logical theory to come to terms\r\nwith psychology.[2] When logic is considered as having to do with the\r\nwholesale activity of thought per se, the question of the historic\r\nprocess by which this or that particular thought came to be, of how its\r\nobject happens to present itself as sensation, or perception, or\r\nconception, is quite irrelevant. These things are mere temporal\r\naccidents. The psychologist (not lifting his gaze from the realm of the\r\nchangeable) may find in them matters of interest. His whole industry is\r\njust with natural history--to trace series of psychical events as they\r\nmutually excite and inhibit one another. But the logician, we are told,\r\nhas a deeper problem and an outlook of more unbounded horizon. He deals\r\nwith the question of the eternal nature of thought and its eternal\r\nvalidity in relation to an eternal reality. He is concerned, not with\r\ngenesis, but with value, not with a historic cycle, but with absolute\r\ndistinctions and relations.\r\n\r\nStill the query haunts us: Is this so in truth? Or has the logician of a\r\ncertain type arbitrarily made it thus by taking his terms apart from\r\nreference to the specific occasions in which they arise and situations\r\nin which they function? If the latter, then the very denial of historic\r\nrelationship and of the significance of historic method, is indicative\r\nonly of the unreal character of his own abstraction. It means in effect\r\nthat the affairs under consideration have been isolated from the\r\nconditions in which alone they have determinable meaning and assignable\r\nworth. It is astonishing that, in the face of the advance of the\r\nevolutionary method in natural science, any logician can persist in the\r\nassertion of a rigid difference between the problem of origin and of\r\nnature; between genesis and analysis; between history and validity. Such\r\nassertion simply reiterates as final a distinction which grew up and\r\nhad meaning in pre-evolutionary science. It asserts against the most\r\nmarked advance which scientific method has yet made a survival of a\r\ncrude period of logical scientific procedure. We have no choice save\r\neither to conceive of thinking as a response to a specific stimulus, or\r\nelse to regard it as something \"in itself,\" having just in and of itself\r\ncertain traits, elements, and laws. If we give up the last view, we must\r\ntake the former.\r\n\r\nThe entire significance of the evolutionary method in biology and social\r\nhistory is that every distinct organ, structure, or formation, every\r\ngrouping of cells or elements, has to be treated as an instrument of\r\nadjustment or adaptation to a particular environing situation. Its\r\nmeaning, its character, its value, is known when, and only when, it is\r\nconsidered as an arrangement for meeting the conditions involved in some\r\nspecific situation. This analysis of value is carried out in detail by\r\ntracing successive stages of development--by endeavoring to locate the\r\nparticular situation in which each structure has its origin, and by\r\ntracing the successive modifications through which, in response to\r\nchanging media, it has reached its present conformation.[3] To persist\r\nin condemning natural history from the standpoint of what natural\r\nhistory meant before it identified itself with an evolutionary process\r\nis not so much to exclude the natural-history standpoint from\r\nphilosophic consideration as it is to evince ignorance of what it\r\nsignifies.\r\n\r\nPsychology as the natural history of the various attitudes and\r\nstructures through which experiencing passes, as an account of the\r\nconditions under which this or that state emerges, and of the way in\r\nwhich it influences, by stimulation or inhibition, production of other\r\nstates or conformations of consciousness, is indispensable to logical\r\nevaluation, the moment we treat logical theory as an account of\r\nthinking as a mode of adaptation to its own generating conditions, and\r\njudge its validity by reference to its efficiency in meeting its\r\nproblems. The historical point of view describes the sequence; the\r\nnormative follows the sequence to its conclusion, and then turns back\r\nand judges each historical step by viewing it in reference to its own\r\noutcome.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the course of changing experience we keep our balance as we move from\r\nsituations of an affectional quality to those which are practical or\r\nappreciative or reflective, because we bear constantly in mind the\r\ncontext in which any particular distinction presents itself. As we\r\nsubmit each characteristic function and situation of experience to our\r\ngaze, we find it has a dual aspect. Wherever there is striving there are\r\nobstacles; wherever there is affection there are persons who are\r\nattached; wherever there is doing there is accomplishment; wherever\r\nthere is appreciation there is value; wherever there is thinking there\r\nis material-in-question. We keep our footing as we move from one\r\nattitude to another, from one characteristic quality to another, because\r\nwe know the position occupied in the whole growth by the particular\r\nfunction in which we are engaged, and the position within the function\r\nof the particular element that engages us.\r\n\r\nThe distinction _between_ each attitude and function and its predecessor\r\nand successor is serial, dynamic, operative. The distinctions _within_\r\nany given operation or function are structural, contemporaneous, and\r\ndistributive. Thinking follows, we will say, striving, and doing follows\r\nthinking. Each in the fulfilment of its own function inevitably calls\r\nout its successor. But coincident, simultaneous, and correspondent\r\n_within_ doing, is the distinction of doer and of deed; _within_ the\r\nfunction of thought, of thinking and material thought upon; within the\r\nfunction of striving, of obstacle of aim, of means and end. We keep our\r\npaths straight because we do not confuse the sequential, efficient, and\r\nfunctional relationship of types of experience with the contemporaneous,\r\ncorrelative, and structural distinctions of elements within a given\r\nfunction. In the seeming maze of endless confusion and unlimited\r\nshiftings, we find our way by the means of the stimulations and checks\r\noccurring within the process we are actually engaged with. We do not\r\ncontrast or confuse a condition or state which is an element in the\r\nformation of one operation with the status or element which is one of\r\nthe distributive terms of another function. If we do, we have at once an\r\ninsoluble, because meaningless, problem upon our hands.\r\n\r\nNow the epistemological logician deliberately shuts himself off from\r\nthose cues and checks upon which the plain man instinctively relies, and\r\nwhich the scientific man deliberately searches for and adopts as\r\nconstituting his technique. Consequently he is likely to set the sort of\r\nobject or material which has place and significance only in one of the\r\nserial functional situations of experience, over against the active\r\nattitude which describes part of the structural constitution of another\r\nsituation; or with equal lack of justification to assimilate terms\r\ncharacteristic of different stages to one another. He sets the agent, as\r\nhe is found in the intimacy of love or appreciation, over against the\r\nexternality of the fact, as that is defined within the reflective\r\nprocess. He takes the material which thought selects as its own basis\r\nfor further procedure to be identical with the significant content which\r\nit secures for itself in the successful pursuit of its aim; and this in\r\nturn he regards as the material which was presented at the outset, and\r\nwhose peculiarities were the express means of awakening thought. He\r\nidentifies the final deposit of the thought-function with its own\r\ngenerating antecedent, and then disposes of the resulting surd by\r\nreference to some metaphysical consideration, which remains when logical\r\ninquiry, when science (as interpreted by him), has done its work. He\r\ndoes this, not because he prefers confusion to order, or error to truth,\r\nbut simply because, when the chain of historic sequence is cut, the\r\nvessel of thought is afloat to veer upon a sea without soundings or\r\nmoorings. There are but two alternatives: either there is an object \"in\r\nitself\" of thought \"in itself,\" or else there are a series of values\r\nwhich vary with the varying functions to which they belong. If the\r\nlatter, the only way these values can be defined is by discriminating\r\nthe functions to which they belong. It is only conditions relative to a\r\nspecific period or epoch of development in a cycle of experience\r\nwhich-enables one to tell what to do next, or to estimate the value and\r\nmeaning of what is already done. And the epistemological logician, in\r\nchoosing to take his question as one of thought which has its own form\r\njust as \"thought,\" apart from the limits of the special work it has to\r\ndo, has deprived himself of these supports and stays.\r\n\r\nThe problem of logic has a more general and a more specific phase. In\r\nits generic form, it deals with this question: How does one type of\r\nfunctional situation and attitude in experience pass out of and into\r\nanother; for example, the technological or utilitarian into the\r\næsthetic, the æsthetic into the religious, the religious into the\r\nscientific, and this into the socio-ethical and so on? The more specific\r\nquestion is: How does the particular functional situation termed the\r\nreflective behave? How shall we describe it? What in detail are its\r\ndiverse contemporaneous distinctions, or divisions of labor, its\r\ncorrespondent _statuses_; in what specific ways do these operate with\r\nreference to each other so as to effect the specific aim which is\r\nproposed by the needs of the affair?\r\n\r\nThis chapter may be brought to conclusion by reference to the more\r\nalternate value of the logic of experience, of logic taken in its wider\r\nsense; that is, as an account of the sequence of the various typical\r\nfunctions or situations of experience in their determining relations to\r\none another. Philosophy, defined as such a logic, makes no pretense to\r\nbe an account of a closed and finished universe. Its business is not to\r\nsecure or guarantee any particular reality or value. _Per contra_, it\r\ngets the significance of a method. The right relationship and adjustment\r\nof the various typical phases of experience to one another is a problem\r\nfelt in every department of life. Intellectual rectification and control\r\nof these adjustments cannot fail to reflect itself in an added clearness\r\nand security on the practical side. It may be that general logic can not\r\nbecome an instrument in the immediate direction of the activities of\r\nscience or art or industry; but it is of value in criticising and in\r\norganizing the tools of immediate research in these lines. It also has\r\ndirect significance in the valuation for social or life-purposes of\r\nresults achieved in particular branches. Much of the immediate business\r\nof life is badly done because we do not know in relation to its\r\ncongeners the organic genesis and outcome of the work that occupies us.\r\nThe manner and degree of appropriation of the values achieved in various\r\ndepartments of social interest and vocation are partial and faulty\r\nbecause we are not clear as to the due rights and responsibilities of\r\none function of experience in reference to others.\r\n\r\nThe value of research for social progress; the bearing of psychology\r\nupon educational procedure; the mutual relations of fine and industrial\r\nart; the question of the extent and nature of specialization in science\r\nin comparison with the claims of applied science; the adjustment of\r\nreligious aspirations to scientific statements; the justification of a\r\nrefined culture for a few in face of economic insufficiency for the\r\nmass--such are a few of the many social questions whose _final_ answer\r\ndepends upon the possession and use of a general logic of experience as\r\na method of inquiry and interpretation. I do not say that headway cannot\r\nbe made in such questions apart from the method indicated: a logic of\r\ngenetic experience. But unless we have a critical and assured view of\r\nthe juncture in which and with reference to which a given attitude or\r\ninterest arises, unless we know the service it is thereby called upon to\r\nperform and hence the organs or methods by which it best functions in\r\nthat service, our progress is impeded and irregular. We take a part for\r\na whole, a means for an end, or attack wholesale some other interest\r\nbecause it interferes with the deified sway of the one we have selected\r\nas ultimate. A clear and comprehensive consensus of social conviction,\r\nand a consequent concentrated and economical direction of effort, are\r\nassured only as there is some way of locating the position and rôle of\r\neach typical interest and occupation in experience. The domain of\r\nopinion is one of conflict; its rule is arbitrary and costly. Only\r\nintellectual method affords a substitute for opinion. The general logic\r\nof experience can alone do for the region of social values and aims what\r\nthe natural sciences after centuries of struggle are doing for activity\r\nin the physical realm.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that systems of philosophy which have attempted to\r\nstate the nature either of thought and of reality at large, apart from\r\nlimits of particular crises in the growth of experience, have been\r\nworthless--though it does mean that their industry has been somewhat\r\nmisapplied. The unfolding of metaphysical theory has made large\r\ncontributions to positive evaluations of the typical situations and\r\nrelationships of experience--even when its conscious intention has been\r\nquite otherwise. Every system of philosophy is itself a mode of\r\nreflection; consequently (if our main contention be true), it too has\r\nbeen evoked out of specific social antecedents, and has had its use as\r\na response to them. It has effected something in modifying the situation\r\nwithin which it found its origin. It may not have solved the problem\r\nwhich it consciously put itself; in many cases we may freely admit that\r\nthe question put has afterward been found to be so wrongly put as to be\r\ninsoluble. Yet exactly the same thing is true, in precisely the same\r\nsense, in the history of science. For this reason, if for no other, it\r\nis impossible for the scientific man to cast the first stone at the\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nThe progress of science in any branch continually brings with it a\r\nrealization that problems in their previous form of statement are\r\ninsoluble because put in terms of unreal conditions; because the real\r\nconditions have been mixed up with mental artifacts or misconstructions.\r\nEvery science is continually learning that its supposed solutions are\r\nonly apparent, because the \"solution\" solves, not the actual problem,\r\nbut one which has been made up. But the very putting of the question,\r\nthe very giving of the wrong answer, induces modification of existing\r\nintellectual habits, standpoints, and aims. Wrestling with the problem,\r\nthere is evolution of new forms of technique to control its treatment,\r\nthere is search for new facts, institution of new types of\r\nexperimentation; there is gain in the methodic control of experience.\r\nAnd all this is progress. It is only the worn-out cynic, the devitalized\r\nsensualist, and the fanatical dogmatist who interpret the continuous\r\nchange of science as proving that, since each successive statement is\r\nwrong, the whole record is error and folly; and that the present truth\r\nis only the error not yet found out. Such draw the moral of caring\r\nnaught for all these things, or of flying to some external authority\r\nwhich will deliver once for all the fixed and unchangeable truth. But\r\nhistoric philosophy even in its aberrant forms has proved a factor in\r\nthe valuation of experience; it has brought problems to light, it has\r\nprovoked intellectual conflicts without which values are only nominal;\r\neven through its would-be absolutistic isolations, it has secured\r\nrecognition of mutual dependencies and reciprocal reinforcements. Yet if\r\nit can define its work more clearly, it can concentrate its energy upon\r\nits own characteristic problem: the genesis and functioning in\r\nexperience of various typical interests and occupations with reference\r\nto one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT AND ITS SUBJECT-MATTER: THE ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS AND CUES OF\r\nTHE THOUGHT-FUNCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have discriminated logic in its wider sense, concerned with the\r\nsequence of characteristic functions and attitudes in experience, from\r\nlogic in its stricter meaning, concerned in particular with description\r\nand interpretation of the function of reflective thought. We must avoid\r\nyielding to the temptation of identifying logic with either of these to\r\nthe exclusion of the other; or of supposing that it is possible to\r\nisolate one finally from the other. The more detailed treatment of the\r\norgans and methods of reflection cannot be carried on with security save\r\nas we have a correct idea of the historic position of reflection in the\r\nevolving of experience. Yet it is impossible to determine this larger\r\nplacing, save as we have a defined and analytic, as distinct from a\r\nmerely vague and gross, view of what we mean by reflection--what is its\r\nactual constitution. It is necessary to work back and forth between the\r\nlarger and the narrower fields, transforming every increment upon one\r\nside into a method of work upon the other, and thereby testing it. The\r\napparent confusion of existing logical theory, its uncertainty as to its\r\nown bounds and limits, its tendency to oscillate from larger questions\r\nof the inherent worth of judgment and validity of inference over to\r\ndetails of scientific technique, and to translation of distinctions of\r\nformal logic into terms of an investigatory or verificatory process, are\r\nindications of the need of this double movement.\r\n\r\nIn the next three chapters it is proposed to take up some of the\r\nconsiderations that lie on the borderland between the larger and the\r\nnarrower conceptions of logical theory. I shall discuss the _locus_ of\r\nthe function of thought, so far as such _locus_ enables us to select and\r\ncharacterize some of the most fundamental distinctions, or divisions of\r\nlabor, within the reflective process. In taking up the problem of the\r\nsubject-matter of thought, I shall try to make clear that it assumes\r\nthree quite distinct forms according to the epochal moment reached in\r\ntransformation of experience; and that continual confusion and\r\ninconsistency are introduced when these respective meanings are not\r\nidentified and described according to their respective geneses and\r\nplaces. I shall attempt to show that we must consider subject-matter\r\nfrom the standpoint, first, of the _antecedents_ or conditions that\r\nevoke thought; second, of the _datum_ or _immediate material_ presented\r\nto thought; and, third, of the _proper content_ of thought. Of these\r\nthree distinctions the first, that of antecedent and stimulus, clearly\r\nrefers to the situation that is immediately prior to the\r\nthought-function as such. The second, that of datum or immediately given\r\nmatter, refers to a distinction which is made within the thought-process\r\nas a part of and for the sake of its own _modus operandi_. It is a\r\nstatus in the scheme of thinking. The third, that of content or object,\r\nrefers to the progress actually made in any thought-function; the\r\nmaterial which is organized into the thought-situation, so far as this\r\nhas fulfilled its purpose. It goes without saying that these are to be\r\ndiscriminated as stages of a life-process in the natural history of\r\nexperience, not as ready-made or ontological; it is contended that, save\r\nas they are differentiated in connection with well-defined historical\r\nstages, they are either lumped off as equivalents, or else treated as\r\nabsolute divisions--or as each by turns, according to the exigencies of\r\nthe particular argument. In fact, this chapter will get at the matter of\r\npreliminary conditions of thought indirectly rather than directly, by\r\nindicating the contradictory positions into which one of the most\r\nvigorous and acute of modern logicians, Lotze, has been forced through\r\nfailing to define logical distinctions in terms of the history of\r\nreadjustment of experience, and therefore endeavoring to interpret\r\ncertain notions as absolute instead of as periodic and methodological.\r\n\r\nBefore passing directly to the exposition and criticism of Lotze, it\r\nwill be well, however, to take the matter in a somewhat freer way. We\r\ncannot approach logical inquiry in a wholly direct and uncompromised\r\nmanner. Of necessity we bring to it certain distinctions--distinctions\r\npartly the outcome of concrete experience; partly due to the logical\r\ntheory which has got embodied in ordinary language and in current\r\nintellectual habits; partly results of deliberate scientific and\r\nphilosophic inquiry. These more or less ready-made results are\r\nresources; they are the only weapons with which we can attack the new\r\nproblem. Yet they are full of unexamined assumptions; they commit us to\r\nall sorts of logically predetermined conclusions. In one sense our study\r\nof the new subject-matter, let us say logical theory, is in truth only a\r\nreview, a re-testing and criticising of the intellectual standpoints and\r\nmethods which we bring with us to the study.\r\n\r\nEveryone comes with certain distinctions already made between the\r\nsubjective and the objective, between the physical and the psychical,\r\nbetween the intellectual and the factual. (1) We have learned to regard\r\nthe region of emotional disturbance, of uncertainty and aspiration, as\r\nbelonging somehow peculiarly to ourselves; we have learned to set over\r\nagainst this a world of observation and of valid thought as something\r\nunaffected by our moods, hopes, fears, and opinions. (2) We have also\r\ncome to distinguish between what is immediately present in our\r\nexperience and the past and the future; we contrast the realms of memory\r\nand anticipation of sense-perception; the given with the ideal. (3) We\r\nare confirmed in a habit of distinguishing between what we call actual\r\nfact and our mental attitude toward that fact--the attitude of surmise\r\nor wonder or reflective investigation. While one of the aims of logical\r\ntheory is precisely to make us critically conscious of the significance\r\nand bearing of these various distinctions, to change them from\r\nready-made assumptions into controlled constructs, our mental habits are\r\nso set that they tend to have their own way with us; and we read into\r\nlogical theory conceptions that were formed before we had even dreamed\r\nof the logical undertaking which after all has for its business to\r\nassign to the terms in question their proper meaning.\r\n\r\nWe find in Lotze an unusually explicit inventory of these various\r\npreliminary distinctions; and an unusually serious effort to deal with\r\nthe problems which arise from introducing them into the structure of\r\nlogical theory. (1) He expressly separates the matter of logical worth\r\nfrom that of psychological genesis. He consequently abstracts the\r\nsubject-matter of logic as such wholly from the question of historic\r\n_locus_ and _situs_. (2) He agrees with common-sense in holding that\r\nlogical thought is reflective and thus presupposes a given material. He\r\noccupies himself with the nature of the antecedent conditions. (3) He\r\nwrestles with the problem of how a material formed prior to thought and\r\nirrespective of it can yet afford it stuff upon which to exercise\r\nitself. (4) He expressly raises the question of how thought working\r\nindependently and from without upon a foreign material can shape the\r\nlatter into results which are valid--that is, objective.\r\n\r\nIf his discussion is successful; if Lotze can provide the intermediaries\r\nwhich span the gulf between an independent thought-material and an\r\nindependent thought-activity; if he can show that the question of the\r\norigin of thought-material and of thought-activity is irrelevant to the\r\nquestion of its worth, we shall have to surrender the position already\r\ntaken. But if we find that Lotze's elaborations only elaborate the same\r\nfundamental difficulty, presenting it now in this light and now in that,\r\nbut never effecting more than presenting the problem as if it were its\r\nown solution, we shall be confirmed in our idea of the need of\r\nconsidering logical questions from a different point of view. If we find\r\nthat, whatever his formal treatment, he always, as matter of fact, falls\r\nback upon some organized situation or function as the source of both the\r\nspecific thought-material and the specific thought-activity in\r\ncorrespondence with each other, we shall have in so far an elucidation\r\nand even a corroboration of our theory.\r\n\r\n1. We begin with the question of the material antecedents of\r\nthought--antecedents which condition reflection, and which call it out\r\nas reaction or response, by giving it its cue. Lotze differs from many\r\nlogicians of the same type in affording us an explicit account of these\r\nantecedents. The ultimate material antecedents of thought are found in\r\nimpressions, which are due to external objects as stimuli. Taken in\r\nthemselves, these impressions are mere psychical states or events. They\r\nexist in us side by side, or one after the other, according as the\r\nobjects which excite them operate simultaneously or successively. The\r\noccurrence of these various psychical states is not, however, entirely\r\ndependent upon the presence of the exciting thing. After a state has\r\nonce been excited, it gets the power of reawakening other states which\r\nhave accompanied it or followed it. The associative mechanism of revival\r\nplays a part. If we had a complete knowledge of both the stimulating\r\nobject and its effects, and of the details of the associative mechanism,\r\nwe should be able from given data to predict the whole course of any\r\ngiven train or current of ideas (for the impressions as conjoined\r\nsimultaneously or successively become ideas and a current of ideas).\r\n\r\nTaken in itself, a sensation or impression is nothing but a \"state of\r\nour consciousness, a mood of ourselves.\" Any given current of ideas is a\r\nnecessary sequence of existences (just as necessary as any succession of\r\nmaterial events), happening in some particular sensitive soul or\r\norganism. \"Just because, under their respective conditions, every such\r\nseries of ideas hangs together by the same necessity and law as every\r\nother, there would be no ground for making any such distinction of value\r\nas that between truth and untruth, thus placing one group in opposition\r\nto all the others.\"[5]\r\n\r\n2. Thus far, as the last quotation clearly indicates, there is no\r\nquestion of reflective thought, and hence no question of logical theory.\r\nBut further examination reveals a peculiar property of the current of\r\nideas. Some ideas are merely coincident, while others may be termed\r\ncoherent. That is to say, the exciting causes of some of our\r\nsimultaneous and successive ideas really belong together; while in other\r\ncases they simply happen to act at the same time, without there being a\r\nreal connection between them. By the associative mechanism, however,\r\nboth the coherent and the merely coincident combinations recur. The\r\nfirst type of recurrence supplies positive material for knowledge; the\r\nsecond gives occasion for error.\r\n\r\n3. It is a peculiar mixture of the coincident and the coherent which\r\nsets the peculiar problem of reflective thought. The business of thought\r\nis to recover and confirm the coherent, the really connected, adding to\r\nits reinstatement an accessory justifying notion of the real ground of\r\ncoherence, while it eliminates the coincident as such. While the mere\r\ncurrent of ideas is something which just happens within us, the process\r\nof elimination and of confirmation by means of statement of real ground\r\nand basis of connection is an activity which mind as such exercises. It\r\nis this distinction which marks off thought as activity from any\r\npsychical event and from the associative mechanism as receptive\r\nhappenings. One is concerned with mere _de facto_ coexistences and\r\nsequences; the other with the _worth_ of these combinations.[6]\r\n\r\nConsideration of the peculiar work of thought in going over, sorting\r\nout, and determining various ideas according to a standard of value will\r\noccupy us in our next chapter. Here we are concerned with the material\r\nantecedents of thought as they are described by Lotze. At first glance,\r\nhe seems to propound a satisfactory theory. He avoids the extravagancies\r\nof transcendental logic, which assumes that all the matter of experience\r\nis determined from the very start by rational thought; and he also\r\navoids the pitfall of purely empirical logic, which makes no distinction\r\nbetween the mere occurrence and association of ideas and the real worth\r\nand validity of the various conjunctions thus produced. He allows\r\nunreflective experience, defined in terms of sensations and their\r\ncombinations, to provide material conditions for thinking, while he\r\nreserves for thought a distinctive work and dignity of its own.\r\nSense-experience furnishes the antecedents; thought has to introduce and\r\ndevelop systematic connection--rationality.\r\n\r\nA further analysis of Lotze's treatment may, however, lead us to believe\r\nthat his statement is riddled through and through with inconsistencies\r\nand self-contradictions; that, indeed, any one part of it can be\r\nmaintained only by the denial of some other portion.\r\n\r\n1. The impression is the ultimate antecedent in its purest or crudest\r\nform (according to the angle from which one views it). It is that which\r\nhas never felt, for good or for bad, the influence of thought. Combined\r\ninto ideas, these impressions stimulate or arouse the activities of\r\nthought, which are forthwith directed upon them. As the recipient of the\r\nactivity which they have excited and brought to bear upon themselves,\r\nthey furnish also the material content of thought--its actual stuff. As\r\nLotze says over and over again: \"It is the relations themselves already\r\nsubsisting between impressions, when we become conscious of them, by\r\nwhich the action of thought which is never anything but reaction, is\r\nattracted; and this action consists merely in interpreting relations\r\nwhich we find existing between our passive impressions into aspects of\r\nthe matter of impressions.\"[7] And again:[8] \"Thought can make no\r\ndifference where it finds none already in the matter of the\r\nimpressions.\" And again:[9] \"The possibility and the success of\r\nthought's procedure depends upon this original constitution and\r\norganization of the whole world of ideas, a constitution which, though\r\nnot necessary in thought, is all the more necessary to make thinking\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe impressions and ideas play a versatile rôle; they now assume the\r\npart of ultimate antecedents and provocative conditions; of crude\r\nmaterial; and somehow, when arranged, of content for thought. This very\r\nversatility awakens suspicion.\r\n\r\nWhile the impression is merely subjective and a bare state of our own\r\nconsciousness, yet it is determined, both as to its existence and as to\r\nits relation to other similar existences, by external objects as\r\nstimuli, if not as causes. It is also determined by a psychical\r\nmechanism so thoroughly objective or regular in its workings as to give\r\nthe same necessary character to the current of ideas that is possessed\r\nby any physical sequence. Thus that which is \"nothing but a state of our\r\nconsciousness\" turns out straightway to be a specifically determined\r\nobjective fact in a system of facts.\r\n\r\nThat this absolute transformation is a contradiction is no clearer than\r\nthat just such a contradiction is indispensable to Lotze. If the\r\nimpressions were nothing but states of consciousness, moods of\r\nourselves, bare psychical existences, it is sure enough that we should\r\nnever even know them to be such, to say nothing of conserving them as\r\nadequate conditions and material for thought. It is only by treating\r\nthem as real facts in a real world, and only by carrying over into them,\r\nin some assumed and unexplained way, the capacity of representing the\r\ncosmic facts which arouse them, that impressions or ideas come in any\r\nsense within the scope of thought. But if the antecedents are really\r\nimpressions-in-their-objective-setting, then Lotze's whole way of\r\ndistinguishing thought-worth from _mere_ existence or event without\r\nobjective significance must be radically modified.\r\n\r\nThe implication that impressions have actually a matter or quality or\r\nmeaning of their own becomes explicit when we refer to Lotze's theory\r\nthat the immediate antecedent of thought is found in the _matter_ of\r\nideas. When thought is said to \"take cognizance of _relations_ which its\r\nown activity does not originate, but which have been prepared for it by\r\nthe unconscious mechanism of the psychic states,\"[10] the attribution of\r\nobjective content, of reference and meaning to ideas, is unambiguous.\r\nThe idea forms a most convenient half-way house for Lotze. On one hand,\r\nas absolutely prior to thought, as material antecedent condition, it is\r\nmerely psychical, a bald subjective event. But as subject-matter for\r\nthought, as antecedent which affords stuff for thought's exercise, it is\r\n_meaning_, characteristic quality of content.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have been told that the impression is a mere receptive\r\nirritation without participation of mental activity, we are not\r\nsurprised, in view of this capacity of ideas, to learn that the mind\r\nactually has a determining share in both the reception of stimuli and in\r\ntheir further associative combinations. The subject always enters into\r\nthe presentation of any mental object, even the sensational, to say\r\nnothing of the perceptional and the imaged. The perception of a given\r\nstate of things is possible only on the assumption that \"the perceiving\r\nsubject is at once enabled and compelled by its own nature to combine\r\nthe excitations which reach it from objects into those forms which it is\r\nto perceive in the objects, and which it supposes itself simply to\r\n_receive_ from them.\"[11]\r\n\r\nIt is only by continual transition from impression and ideas as mental\r\nstates and events to ideas as cognitive (or logical) _objects or\r\ncontents_, that Lotze bridges the gulf from bare exciting antecedent to\r\nconcrete material conditions of thought. This contradiction, again, is\r\nnecessary to Lotze's standpoint. To set out frankly with \"meanings\" as\r\nantecedents would demand reconsideration of the whole view-point, which\r\nsupposes that the difference between the logical and its antecedent is a\r\nmatter of the difference between _worth_ and mere _existence_ or\r\n_occurrence_. It would indicate that since meaning or value is already\r\nthere, the task of thought must be that of the transformation or\r\n_reconstruction of worth_ through an intermediary process of valuation.\r\nOn the other hand, to stick by the standpoint of _mere_ existence is not\r\nto get anything which can be called even antecedent of thought.\r\n\r\n2. Why is there a task of transformation? Consideration of the material\r\nin its function of evoking thought, giving it its cue, will serve to\r\ncomplete the picture of the contradiction and of the real facts. It is\r\nthe conflict between ideas as merely coincident and ideas as coherent\r\nthat constitutes the need which provokes the response of thought. Here\r\nLotze vibrates (_a_) between considering coincidence and coherence as\r\nboth affairs of existence of psychical events; (_b_) considering\r\ncoincidence as purely psychical and coherence as at least quasi-logical,\r\nand (_c_) the inherent logic which makes them both determinations within\r\nthe sphere of reflective thought. In strict accordance with his own\r\npremises, coincidence and coherence both ought to be mere peculiarities\r\nof the current of ideas as events within ourselves. But so taken the\r\ndistinction becomes absolutely meaningless. Events do not cohere; at the\r\nmost certain sets of them happen more or less frequently than other\r\nsets; the only intelligible difference is one of repetition of\r\ncoincidence. And even this attributes to an event the supernatural trait\r\nof reappearing after it has disappeared. Even coincidence has to be\r\ndefined in terms of relation of the _objects_ which are supposed to\r\nexcite the psychical events that happen together.\r\n\r\nAs recent psychological discussion has made clear enough, it is the\r\nmatter, meaning, or content, of ideas that is associated, not the ideas\r\nas states or existences. Take such an idea as sun-revolving-about-earth.\r\nWe may say it means the conjunction of various sense-impressions, but it\r\nis conjunction, or mutual reference, of _attributes_ that we have in\r\nmind in the assertion. It is absolutely certain that our psychical image\r\nof the sun is not psychically engaged in revolving about our psychical\r\nimage of the earth. It would be amusing if such were the case; theaters\r\nand all dramatic representations would be at a discount. In truth,\r\nsun-revolving-about-earth is a single meaning or idea; it is a unified\r\nsubject-matter within which certain distinctions of reference appear. It\r\nis concerned with what we intend when we think earth and sun, and think\r\nthem in their relation to each other. It is really a specification or\r\ndirection of how to think when we have occasion to think a certain\r\nsubject-matter. To treat the origin of this mutual reference as if it\r\nwere simply a case of conjunction of ideas produced by conditions of\r\noriginal psycho-physical irritation and association is a profound case\r\nof the psychological fallacy. We may, indeed, analyze an experience and\r\nfind that it had its origin in certain conditions of the sensitive\r\norganism, in certain peculiarities of perception and of association,\r\nand hence conclude that the belief involved in it was not justified\r\nby the facts themselves. But the significance of the belief in\r\nsun-revolving-about-earth as an item of the experience of those who\r\nmeant it, consisted precisely in the fact that it was taken not as a\r\nmere association of feelings, but as a definite portion of the whole\r\nstructure of objective experience, guaranteed by other parts of the\r\nfabric, and lending its support and giving its tone to them. It was to\r\nthem part of the experience-frame of things--of the real universe.\r\n\r\nPut the other way, if such an instance meant a mere conjunction of\r\npsychical states, there would be in it absolutely nothing to evoke\r\nthought. Each idea as event, as Lotze himself points out (Vol. I, p. 2),\r\nmay be regarded as adequately and necessarily determined to the place it\r\noccupies. There is absolutely no question on the side of events of mere\r\ncoincidence _versus_ genuine connection. As event, it is there and it\r\nbelongs there. We cannot treat something as at once bare fact of\r\nexistence and as problematic subject-matter of logical inquiry. To take\r\nthe reflective point of view is to consider the matter in a totally new\r\nlight; as Lotze says, it is to raise the question of rightful claims to\r\na position or relation.\r\n\r\nThe point becomes clearer when we contrast coincidence with connection.\r\nTo consider coincidence as simply psychical, and coherence as at least\r\nquasi-logical, is to put the two on such different bases that no\r\nquestion of contrasting them can arise. The coincidence which precedes a\r\nvalid or grounded coherence (the conjunction which as coexistence of\r\nobjects and sequence of acts is perfectly adequate) never is, as\r\nantecedent, the coincidence which is set over against coherence. The\r\nside-by-sideness of books on my bookshelf, the succession of noises that\r\nrise through my window, do not as such trouble me logically. They do not\r\nappear as errors or even as problems. One coexistence is just as good as\r\nany other until some new point of view, or new end, presents itself. If\r\nit is a question of the convenience of arrangement of books, then the\r\nvalue of their present collocation becomes a problem. Then I may\r\ncontrast their present bare conjunction with a scheme of possible\r\ncoherence. If I regard the sequence of noises as a case of articulate\r\nspeech, their order becomes important--it is a problem to be determined.\r\nThe inquiry whether a given combination means only apparent or real\r\nconnection, shows that reflective inquiry is already going on. Does this\r\nphase of the moon really mean rain, or does it just happen that the\r\nrain-storm comes when the moon has reached this phase? To ask such\r\nquestions shows that a certain portion of the universe of experience is\r\nsubjected to critical analysis for purposes of definitive restatement.\r\nThe tendency to regard one combination as bare conjunction or mere\r\ncoincidence is absolutely a _part_ of the movement of mind in its search\r\nfor the real connection.\r\n\r\nIf coexistence as such is to be set over against coherence as such, as\r\nthe non-logical against the logical, then, since our whole spatial\r\nuniverse is one of collocation, and since thought in this universe can\r\nnever get farther than substituting one collocation for another, the\r\nwhole realm of space-experience is condemned off-hand and in perpetuity\r\nto anti-rationality. But, in truth, coincidence as over against\r\ncoherence, conjunction as over against connection, is just _suspected_\r\ncoherence, one which is under the fire of active inquiry. The\r\ndistinction is one which arises only within the grasp of the logical or\r\nreflective function.\r\n\r\n3. This brings us explicitly to the fact that there is no such thing as\r\neither coincidence or coherence in terms of the elements or meanings\r\ncontained in any couple or pair of ideas taken by itself. It is only\r\nwhen they are co-factors in a situation or function which includes more\r\nthan either the \"coincident\" or the \"coherent\" and more than the\r\narithmetical sum of the two, that thought's activity can be evoked.\r\nLotze is continually in this dilemma: Thought either shapes its own\r\nmaterial or else just accepts it. In the first case (since Lotze cannot\r\nrid himself of the presumption that thought must have a fixed ready-made\r\nantecedent) its activity can only alter this stuff and thus lead the\r\nmind farther away from reality. But if thought just accepts its\r\nmaterial, how can there be any distinctive aim or activity of thought at\r\nall? As we have seen, Lotze endeavors to escape this dilemma by\r\nsupposing that, while thought receives its material, it yet checks it\r\nup: it eliminates certain portions of it and reinstates others, plus the\r\nstamp and seal of its own validity.\r\n\r\nLotze objects most strenuously to the notion that thought awaits its\r\nsubject-matter with certain ready-made modes of apprehension. This\r\nnotion would raise the insoluble question of how thought contrives to\r\nbring the matter of each impression under that particular form which is\r\nappropriate to it (Vol. I, p. 24). But he has not really avoided the\r\ndifficulty. How does thought know which of the combinations are merely\r\ncoincident and which are merely coherent? How does it know which to\r\neliminate as irrelevant and which to confirm as grounded? Either this\r\nevaluation is an imposition of its own, or else gets its cue and clue\r\nfrom the subject-matter. Now, if the coincident and the coherent taken\r\nin and of themselves are competent to give this direction, they are\r\nalready practically labeled. The further work of thought is one of\r\nsupererogation. It has at most barely to note and seal the material\r\ncombinations that are already there. Such a view clearly renders\r\nthought's work as unnecessary in form as it is futile in force.\r\n\r\nBut there is no alternative in this dilemma except to recognize that an\r\nentire situation of experience, within which are both that afterward\r\nfound to be mere coincidence and that found to be real connection,\r\nactually provokes thought. It is only as an experience previously\r\naccepted comes up in its wholeness against another one equally integral;\r\nand only as some larger experience dawns which requires each as a part\r\nof itself and yet within which the required factors show themselves\r\nmutually incompatible, that thought arises. It is not bare coincidence,\r\nor bare connection, or bare addition of one to the other, that excites\r\nthought. It is a situation which is organized or constituted as a whole,\r\nand which yet is falling to pieces in its parts--a situation which is in\r\nconflict within itself--that arouses the search to find what really goes\r\ntogether and a correspondent effort to shut out what only seemingly\r\nbelongs together. And real coherence means precisely capacity to exist\r\nwithin the comprehending whole. It is a case of the psychologist's\r\nfallacy to read back into the preliminary situation those distinctions\r\nof mere conjunction of material and of valid relationship which get\r\nexistence, to say nothing of fixation, only within the thought-process.\r\n\r\nWe must not leave this phase of the discussion, however, until it is\r\nquite clear that our objection is not to Lotze's position that\r\nreflective thought arises from an antecedent which is not reflectional\r\nin character; nor yet to his idea that this antecedent has a certain\r\nstructure and content of its own setting the peculiar problem which\r\nevokes thought and gives the cue to its specific activities. On the\r\ncontrary, it is this latter point upon which we would insist; and, by\r\ninsisting, point out, negatively, that this view is absolutely\r\ninconsistent with Lotze's theory that psychical impressions and ideas\r\nare the true antecedents of thought; and, positively, that it is the\r\n_situation as a whole_, and not any one isolated part of it, or\r\ndistinction within it, that calls forth and directs thinking. We must\r\nbeware the fallacy of assuming that some one element in the prior\r\nsituation in isolation or detachment induces the thought which in\r\nreality comes forth only from the whole disturbed situation. On the\r\nnegative side, characterizations of impression and idea (whether as\r\nmental contents or as psychical existences) are distinctions which arise\r\nonly within reflection upon the situation which is the genuine\r\nantecedent of thought; while the distinction of psychical existences\r\nfrom external existences arises only within a highly elaborate technical\r\nreflection--that of the psychologist as such.[12] Positively, it is the\r\nwhole dynamic experience with its qualitative and pervasive identity of\r\nvalue, and its inner distraction, its elements at odds with each other,\r\nin tension against each other, contending each for its proper placing\r\nand relationship, that generates the thought-situation.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view, at this period of development, the distinctions\r\nof objective and subjective have a characteristic meaning. The\r\nantecedent, to repeat, is a situation in which the various factors are\r\nactively incompatible with each other, and which yet in and through the\r\nstriving tend to a re-formation of the whole and to a restatement of the\r\nparts. This situation as such is clearly objective. It is there; it is\r\nthere as a whole; the various parts are there; and their active\r\nincompatibility with one another is there. Nothing is conveyed at this\r\npoint by asserting that any particular part of the situation is illusory\r\nor subjective, or mere appearance; or that any other is truly real. It\r\nis the further work of _thought_ to exclude some of the contending\r\nfactors from membership in experience, and thus to relegate them to the\r\nsphere of the merely subjective. But just at this epoch the experience\r\nexists as one of vital and active confusion and conflict. The conflict\r\nis not only objective in a _de facto_ sense (that is, really existent),\r\nbut is objective in a logical sense as well; it is just this conflict\r\nwhich effects the transition into the thought-situation--this, in turn,\r\nbeing only a constant movement toward a defined equilibrium. The\r\nconflict has objective logical value because it is the antecedent\r\ncondition and cue of thought.\r\n\r\nEvery reflective attitude and function, whether of naïve life,\r\ndeliberate invention, or controlled scientific research, has risen\r\nthrough the medium of some such total objective situation. The abstract\r\nlogician may tell us that sensations or impressions, or associated\r\nideas, or bare physical things, or conventional symbols, are antecedent\r\nconditions. But such statements cannot be verified by reference to a\r\nsingle instance of thought in connection with actual practice or actual\r\nscientific research. Of course, by extreme mediation symbols may become\r\nconditions of evoking thought. They get to be objects in an active\r\nexperience. But they are stimuli only in case their manipulation to form\r\na new whole occasions resistance, and thus reciprocal tension. Symbols\r\nand their definitions develop to a point where dealing with them becomes\r\nitself an experience, having its own identity; just as the handling of\r\ncommercial commodities, or arrangement of parts of an invention, is an\r\nindividual experience. There is always as antecedent to thought an\r\nexperience of some subject-matter of the physical or social world, or\r\norganized intellectual world, whose parts are actively at war with each\r\nother--so much so that they threaten to disrupt the entire experience,\r\nwhich accordingly for its own maintenance requires deliberate\r\nre-definition and re-relation of its tensional parts. This is the\r\nreconstructive process termed thinking: the reconstructive situation,\r\nwith its parts in tension and in such movement toward each other as\r\ntends to a unified experience, is the thought-situation.\r\n\r\nThis at once suggests the subjective phase. The situation, the\r\nexperience as such, is objective. There is an experience of the confused\r\nand conflicting tendencies. But just _what in particular_ is objective,\r\njust _what_ form the situation shall take as an organized harmonious\r\nwhole, is unknown; that is the problem. It is the uncertainty as to the\r\n_what_ of the experience together with the certainty _that_ there is\r\nsuch an experience, that evokes the thought-function. Viewed from this\r\nstandpoint of uncertainty, the situation as a whole is subjective. No\r\nparticular content or reference can be asserted off-hand. Definite\r\nassertion is expressly reserved--it is to be the outcome of the\r\nprocedure of reflective inquiry now undertaken. This holding off of\r\ncontents from definitely asserted position, this viewing them as\r\ncandidates for reform, is what we mean at this stage of the natural\r\nhistory of thought by the subjective.\r\n\r\nWe have followed Lotze through his tortuous course of inconsistencies.\r\nIt is better, perhaps, to run the risk of vain repetition, than that of\r\nleaving the impression that these are _mere_ self-contradictions. It is\r\nan idle task to expose contradictions save we realize them in relation\r\nto the fundamental assumption which breeds them. Lotze is bound to\r\ndifferentiate thought from its antecedents. He is intent to do this,\r\nhowever, through a preconception that marks off the thought-situation\r\nradically from its predecessor, through a difference that is complete,\r\nfixed, and absolute, or at large. It is a total contrast of thought as\r\nsuch to something else as such that he requires, not a contrast within\r\nexperience of one phase of a process, one period of a rhythm, from\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThis complete and rigid difference Lotze finds in the difference between\r\nan experience which is _mere existence_ or occurrence, and one which has\r\nto do with worth, truth, right relationship. Now things, objects, have\r\nalready, implicitly at least, determinations of worth, of truth,\r\nreality, etc. The same is true of deeds, affections, etc., etc. Only\r\nstates of feelings, bare impressions, etc., seem to fulfil the\r\nprerequisite of being given as existence, and yet without qualification\r\nas to worth, etc. Then the current of ideas offers itself, a ready-made\r\nstream of events, of existences, which can be characterized as wholly\r\ninnocent of reflective determination, and as the natural predecessor of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nBut this stream of existences is no sooner there than its total\r\nincapacity to officiate as material condition and cue of thought\r\nappears. It is about as relevant as are changes that may be happening on\r\nthe other side of the moon. So, one by one, the whole series of\r\ndeterminations of value or worth already traced are introduced _into_\r\nthe very make-up, the inner structure, of what was to be _mere_\r\nexistence: viz., (1) value as determined by things of whose spatial and\r\ntemporal relations the things are somehow _representative_; (2) hence,\r\nvalue in the shape of _meaning_--the idea as significant, possessed of\r\nquality, and not a mere event; (3) distinguished values of coincidence\r\nand coherence within the stream. All these kinds of value are explicitly\r\nasserted, as we have seen; underlying and running through them all is\r\nthe recognition of the supreme value of a situation which is organized\r\nas a whole, yet conflicting in its inner constitution.\r\n\r\nThese contradictions all arise in the attempt to put thought's work, as\r\nconcerned with value or validity over against experience as a mere\r\nantecedent happening, or occurrence. Since this contrast arises because\r\nof the deeper attempt to consider thought as an independent somewhat in\r\ngeneral which yet, in _our_ experience, is specifically dependent, the\r\nsole radical avoiding of the contradictions can be found in the endeavor\r\nto characterize thought as a specific mode of valuation in the evolution\r\nof significant experience, having its own specific occasion or demand,\r\nand its own specific place.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the organization and value that the antecedent conditions\r\nof the thought-function possess is too large a question here to enter\r\nupon in detail. Lotze himself suggests the answer. He speaks of the\r\ncurrent of ideas, just as a current, supplying us with the \"mass of\r\nwell-grounded information which _regulates_ daily life\" (Vol. I, p. 4).\r\nIt gives rise to \"_useful combinations_,\" \"_correct expectations_,\"\r\n\"_seasonable reactions_\" (Vol. I, p. 7). He speaks of it, indeed, as if\r\nit were just the ordinary world of naïve experience, the so-called\r\nempirical world, as distinct from the world as critically revised and\r\nrationalized in scientific and philosophic inquiry. The contradiction\r\nbetween this interpretation and that of a mere stream of psychical\r\nimpressions is only another instance of the difficulty already\r\ndiscussed. But the phraseology suggests the type of value possessed by\r\nit. The unreflective world is a world of practical values; of ends and\r\nmeans, of their effective adaptations; of control and regulation of\r\nconduct in view of results. Even the most purely utilitarian of values\r\nare nevertheless values; not _mere_ existences. But the world of\r\nuncritical experience is saved from reduction to just material uses and\r\nworths; for it is a world of social aims and means, involving at every\r\nturn the values of affection and attachment, of competition and\r\nco-operation. It has incorporate also in its own being the surprise of\r\næsthetic values--the sudden joy of light, the gracious wonder of tone\r\nand form.\r\n\r\nI do not mean that this holds in gross of the unreflective world of\r\nexperience over against the critical thought-situation--such a contrast\r\nimplies the very wholesale, at large, consideration of thought which I\r\nam striving to avoid. Doubtless many and many an act of thought has\r\nintervened in effecting the organization of our commonest\r\npractical-affectional-æsthetic region of values. I only mean to indicate\r\nthat thought does take place in such a world; not _after_ a world of\r\nbare existences lacking value-specifications; and that the more\r\nsystematic reflection we call organized science, may, in some fair\r\nsense, be said to come _after_, but to come after affectional, artistic,\r\nand technological interests which have found realization and expression\r\nin building up a world of values.\r\n\r\nHaving entered so far upon a suggestion which cannot be followed out, I\r\nventure one other digression. The notion that value or significance as\r\ndistinct from mere existentiality is the product of thought or reason,\r\nand that the source of Lotze's contradictions lies in the effort to find\r\n_any_ situation prior or antecedent to thought, is a familiar one--it is\r\neven possible that my criticisms of Lotze have been interpreted by some\r\nreaders in this sense.[13] This is the position frequently called\r\nneo-Hegelian (though, I think, with questionable accuracy), and has been\r\ndeveloped by many writers in criticising Kant. This position and that\r\ntaken in this chapter do indeed agree in certain general regards. They\r\nare at one in denial of the factuality and the possibility of\r\ndeveloping fruitful reflection out of antecedent bare existence or mere\r\nevents. They unite in denying that there is or can be any such thing as\r\nmere existence--phenomenon unqualified as respects meaning, whether such\r\nphenomenon be psychic or cosmic. They agree that reflective thought\r\ngrows organically out of an experience which is already organized, and\r\nthat it functions within such an organism. But they part company when a\r\nfundamental question is raised: Is all organized meaning the work of\r\nthought? Does it therefore follow that the organization out of which\r\nreflective thought grows is the work of thought of some other type--of\r\nPure Thought, Creative or Constitutive Thought, Intuitive Reason, etc.?\r\nI shall indicate briefly the reasons for divergence at this point.\r\n\r\nTo cover all the practical-social-æsthetic values involved, the term\r\n\"thought\" has to be so stretched that the situation might as well be\r\ncalled by any other name that describes a typical value of experience.\r\nMore specifically, when the difference is minimized between the\r\norganized and arranged scheme of values out of which reflective inquiry\r\nproceeds, and reflective inquiry itself (and there can be no other\r\nreason for insisting that the antecedent of reflective thought is itself\r\nsomehow thought), exactly the same type of problem recurs that presents\r\nitself when the distinction is exaggerated into one between bare\r\nunvalued existences and rational coherent meanings.\r\n\r\nFor the more one insists that the antecedent situation is constituted by\r\nthought, the more one has to wonder why another type of thought is\r\nrequired; what need arouses it, and how it is possible for it to improve\r\nupon the work of previous constitutive thought. This difficulty at once\r\nforces us from a logic of experience as it is concretely experienced\r\ninto a metaphysic of a purely hypothetical experience. Constitutive\r\nthought precedes _our_ conscious thought-operations; hence it must be\r\nthe working of some absolute universal thought which, unconsciously to\r\nour reflection, builds up an organized world. But this recourse only\r\ndeepens the difficulty. How does it happen that the absolute\r\nconstitutive and intuitive Thought does such a poor and bungling job\r\nthat it requires a finite discursive activity to patch up its products?\r\nHere more metaphysic is called for: The Absolute Reason is now supposed\r\nto work under limiting conditions of finitude, of a sensitive and\r\ntemporal organism. The antecedents of reflective thought are not,\r\ntherefore, determinations of thought pure and undefiled, but of what\r\nthought can do when it stoops to assume the yoke of change and of\r\nfeeling. I pass by the metaphysical problem left unsolved by this flight\r\ninto metaphysic: Why and how should a perfect, absolute, complete,\r\nfinished thought find it necessary to submit to alien, disturbing, and\r\ncorrupting conditions in order, in the end, to recover through\r\nreflective thought in a partial, piecemeal, wholly inadequate way what\r\nit possessed at the outset in a much more satisfactory way?\r\n\r\nI confine myself to the logical difficulty. How can thought relate\r\nitself to the fragmentary sensations, impressions, feelings, which, in\r\ntheir contrast with and disparity from the workings of constitutive\r\nthought, mark it off from the latter; and which in their connection with\r\nits products give the cue to reflective thinking? _Here we have again\r\nexactly the problem with which Lotze has been wrestling_: we have the\r\nsame insoluble question of the reference of thought-activity to a wholly\r\nindeterminate unrationalized, independent, prior existence. The absolute\r\nrationalist who takes up the problem at this point will find himself\r\nforced into the same continuous seesaw, the same scheme of alternate\r\nrude robbery and gratuitous gift, that Lotze engaged in. The simple fact\r\nis that here _is_ just where Lotze himself began; he saw that previous\r\ntranscendental logicians had left untouched the specific question of\r\nrelation of _our_ supposedly finite, reflective thought to its own\r\nantecedents, and he set out to make good the defect. If reflective\r\nthought is required because constitutive thought works under externally\r\nlimiting conditions of sense, then we have some elements which are,\r\nafter all, mere existences, events, etc. Or, if they have organization\r\nfrom some other source, and induce reflective thought not as bare\r\nimpressions, etc., but through their place in some whole, then we have\r\nadmitted the possibility of organic unity in experience, apart from\r\nReason, and the ground for assuming Pure Constitutive Thought is\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe contradiction appears equally when viewed from the side of\r\nthought-activity and its characteristic forms. All our knowledge, after\r\nall, of thought as constitutive is gained by consideration of the\r\noperations of reflective thought. The perfect system of thought is so\r\nperfect that it is a luminous, harmonious whole, without definite parts\r\nor distinctions--or, if there are such, it is only reflection that\r\nbrings them out. The categories and methods of constitutive thought\r\nitself must therefore be characterized in terms of the _modus operandi_\r\nof reflective thought. Yet the latter takes place just because of the\r\npeculiar problem of the peculiar conditions under which it arises. Its\r\nwork is progressive, reformatory, reconstructive, synthetic, in the\r\nterminology made familiar by Kant. We are not only _not_ justified,\r\naccordingly, in transferring its determinations over to constitutive\r\nthought, but we are absolutely prohibited from attempting any such\r\ntransfer. To identify logical processes, states, devices, results that\r\nare conditioned upon the primary fact of resistance to thought as\r\nconstitutive with the structure of such thought is as complete an\r\ninstance of the fallacy of recourse from one genus to another as could\r\nwell be found. Constitutive and reflective thought are, first, defined\r\nin terms of their dissimilarity and even opposition, and then without\r\nmore ado the forms of the description of the latter are carried over\r\nbodily to the former![14]\r\n\r\nThis is not meant for a merely controversial criticism. It is meant to\r\npoint positively toward the fundamental thesis of these chapters: All\r\nthe distinctions of the thought-function, of conception as over against\r\nsense-perception, of judgment in its various modes and forms, of\r\ninference in its vast diversity of operation--all these distinctions\r\ncome within the thought-situation as growing out of a characteristic\r\nantecedent typical formation of experience; and have for their purpose\r\nthe solution of the peculiar problem with respect to which the\r\nthought-function is generated or evolved: the restoration of a\r\ndeliberately integrated experience from the inherent conflict into which\r\nit has fallen.\r\n\r\nThe failure of transcendental logic has the same origin as the failure\r\nof the empiristic (whether taken pure or in the mixed form in which\r\nLotze presents it). It makes absolute and fixed certain distinctions of\r\nexistence and meaning, and of one kind of meaning and another kind,\r\nwhich are wholly historic and relative in their origin and their\r\nsignificance. It views thought as attempting to represent or state\r\nreality once for all, instead of trying to determine some phases or\r\ncontents of it with reference to their more effective and significant\r\nreciprocal employ--instead of as reconstructive. The rock against which\r\nevery such logic splits is that either reality already has the statement\r\nwhich thought is endeavoring to give it, or else it has not. In the\r\nformer case, thought is futilely reiterative; in the latter, it is\r\nfalsificatory.\r\n\r\nThe significance of Lotze for critical purposes is that his peculiar\r\neffort to combine a transcendental view of thought (_i. e._, of Thought\r\nas active in forms of its own, pure in and of themselves) with certain\r\nobvious facts of the dependence of our thought upon specific empirical\r\nantecedents, brings to light fundamental defects in both the empiristic\r\nand the transcendental logics. We discover a common failure in both: the\r\nfailure to view logical terms and distinctions with respect to their\r\nnecessary function in the redintegration of experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT AND ITS SUBJECT-MATTER: THE DATUM OF THINKING\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a second epochal stage in the evolution of the\r\nthought-situation, a crisis which forces upon us the problem of the\r\ndistinction and mutual reference of the datum or presentation, and the\r\nideas or \"thoughts.\" It will economize and perhaps clarify discussion if\r\nwe start from the relatively positive and constructive result just\r\nreached, and review Lotze's treatment from that point of regard.\r\n\r\nWe have reached the point of conflict in the matters or contents of an\r\nexperience. It is _in_ this conflict and because of it that the matters\r\nor contents, or significant quales, stand out as such. As long as the\r\nsun revolves about earth without tension or question, this \"content,\" or\r\nfact, is not in any way abstracted _as_ content or object. Its very\r\ndistinction as content from the form or mode of experience as such is\r\nthe result of post-reflection. The same conflict makes other experiences\r\nassume conscious objectification; they, too, cease to be ways of living,\r\nand become distinct objects of observation and consideration. The\r\nmovements of planets, eclipses, etc., are cases in point.[15] The\r\nmaintenance of a unified experience has become a problem, an end. It is\r\nno longer secure. But this involves such restatement of the conflicting\r\nelements as will enable them to take a place somewhere in the new\r\nexperience; they must be disposed of somehow, and they can be disposed\r\nof finally only as they are provided for. That is, they cannot be\r\nsimply denied or excluded or eliminated; they must be taken into the\r\nfold of the new experience; such introduction, on the other hand,\r\nclearly demands more or less modification or transformation on their\r\npart. The thought-situation is the conscious maintenance of the unity of\r\nexperience, with a critical consideration of the claims of the various\r\nconflicting contents to a place within itself, and a deliberate final\r\nassignment of position.\r\n\r\nThe conflicting situation inevitably polarizes or dichotomizes itself.\r\nThere is somewhat which is untouched in the contention of incompatibles.\r\nThere is something which remains secure, unquestioned. On the other\r\nhand, there are elements which are rendered doubtful and precarious.\r\nThis gives the framework of the general distribution of the field into\r\n\"facts,\" the given, the presented, the Datum; and ideas, the ideal, the\r\nconceived, the Thought. For there is always something unquestioned in\r\nany problematic situation at any stage of its process,[16] even if it be\r\nonly the fact of conflict or tension. For this is never _mere_ tension\r\nat large. It is thoroughly qualified, or characteristically toned and\r\ncolored, by the particular elements which are in strife. Hence it is\r\n_this_ conflict, unique and irreplaceable. That it comes now means\r\nprecisely that it has never come before; that it is now passed in review\r\nand some sort of a settlement reached, means that just _this_ conflict\r\nwill never recur. In a word, the conflict as such is immediately\r\nexpressed, or felt, as of just this and no other sort, and this\r\nimmediately apprehended quality is an irreducible datum. _It_ is fact,\r\neven if all else be _doubtful_. As it is subjected to examination, it\r\nloses vagueness and assumes more definite form.\r\n\r\nOnly in very extreme cases, however, does the assured, unquestioned\r\nelement reduce to as low terms as we have here imagined. Certain things\r\ncome to stand forth as facts, no matter what else may be doubted. There\r\nare certain _apparent_ diurnal changes of the sun; there is a certain\r\nannual course or track. There are certain nocturnal changes in the\r\nplanets, and certain seasonal rhythmic paths. The significance of these\r\nmay be doubted: Do they _mean_ real change in the sun or in the earth?\r\nBut change, and change of a certain definite and numerically determinate\r\ncharacter is there. It is clear that such out-standing facts\r\n(ex-istences) constitute the data, the given or presented, of the\r\nthought-function.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this is only one correspondent, or status, in the\r\ntotal situation. With the consciousness of _this_ as certain, as given\r\nto be reckoned with, goes the consciousness of uncertainty as to _what\r\nit means_--of how it is to be understood or interpreted. The facts _qua_\r\npresentation or existences are sure; _qua_ meaning (position and\r\nrelationship in an experience yet to be secured) they are doubtful.\r\nYet doubt does not preclude memory or anticipation. Indeed, it is\r\npossible only through them. The memory of past experience makes\r\nsun-revolving-about-earth an object of attentive regard. The\r\nrecollection of certain other experiences suggests the idea of\r\nearth-rotating-daily-on-axis and revolving-annually-about-sun. These\r\ncontents are as much present as is the observation of change, but as\r\nrespects worth, they are only possibilities. Accordingly, they are\r\ncategorized or disposed of as just ideas, meanings, thoughts, ways of\r\nconceiving, comprehending, interpreting facts.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence of reference here is as obvious as correlation of\r\nexistence. In the logical process, the datum is not just real existence,\r\nand the idea mere psychical unreality. Both are modes of existence--one\r\nof _given_ existence, the other of _mental_ existence. And if the\r\nmental existence is in such cases regarded, from the standpoint of the\r\nunified experience aimed at, as having only _possible_ value, the datum\r\nalso is regarded, from the value standpoint, as incomplete and\r\nunassured. The very existence of the idea or meaning as separate _is_\r\nthe partial, broken up, and hence objectively unreal (from the validity\r\nstandpoint) character of the datum. Or, as we commonly put it, while the\r\nideas are impressions, suggestions, guesses, theories, estimates, etc.,\r\nthe facts are crude, raw, unorganized, brute. They lack relationship,\r\nthat is, assured place in the universe; they are deficient as to\r\ncontinuity. Mere change of apparent position of sun, which is absolutely\r\nunquestioned as datum, is a sheer abstraction from the standpoint either\r\nof the organized experience left behind, or of the reorganized\r\nexperience which is the end--the objective. It is impossible as a\r\npersistent object in experience or reality. In other words, datum and\r\nideatum are divisions of labor, co-operative instrumentalities, for\r\neconomical dealing with the problem of the maintenance of the integrity\r\nof experience.\r\n\r\nOnce more, and briefly, both datum and ideatum may (and positively,\r\nveritably, do) break up, each for itself, into physical and psychical.\r\nIn so far as the conviction gains ground that the earth revolves about\r\nthe sun, the old fact is broken up into a new cosmic existence, and a\r\nnew psychological condition--the recognition of a mental process in\r\nvirtue of which movements of smaller bodies in relation to very remote\r\nlarger bodies are interpreted in a reverse sense. We do not just\r\neliminate as false the source of error in the old content. We\r\nreinterpret it as valid in its own place, viz., a case of the psychology\r\nof apperception, although invalid as a matter of cosmic structure. In\r\nother words, with increasing accuracy of determination of the given,\r\nthere comes a distinction, for methodological purposes, between the\r\n_quality_ or matter of the sense-experience and its _form_--the\r\nsense-perceiving, as itself a psychological fact, having its own place\r\nand laws or relations. Moreover, the old experience, that of\r\nsun-revolving, abides. But it is regarded as belonging to \"me\"--to this\r\nexperiencing individual, rather than to the cosmic world. It is\r\n_psychic_.\r\n\r\nHere, then, _within_ the growth of the thought-situation and as a part\r\nof the process of determining _specific_ truth under _specific_\r\nconditions, we get for the first time the clue to that distinction with\r\nwhich, as ready-made and prior to all thinking, Lotze started out,\r\nnamely, the separation of the matter of impression from impression as\r\npsychical event. The separation which, taken at large, engenders an\r\ninsoluble problem, appears within a particular reflective inquiry, as an\r\ninevitable differentiation of a scheme of values.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of thing occurs on the side of thought, or meaning. The\r\nmeaning or idea which is growing in acceptance, which is gaining ground\r\nas meaning-of-datum, gets logical or intellectual or objective force;\r\nthat which is losing standing, which is increasingly doubtful, gets\r\nqualified as just a notion, a fancy, a pre-judice, mis-conception--or\r\nfinally just an error, a mental slip.\r\n\r\nEvaluated as fanciful in validity it becomes mere image--subjective;[17]\r\nand finally a psychical existence. It is not eliminated, but receives a\r\nnew reference or meaning. Thus the distinction between subjectivity and\r\nobjectivity is not one between meaning as such and datum as such. It is\r\na specification that emerges, correspondently, in _both_ datum and\r\nideatum, as affairs of the direction of logical movement. That which is\r\nleft behind in the evolution of accepted meaning is characterized as\r\nreal, but only in a psychical sense; that which is moved toward is\r\nregarded as real in an objective, cosmic sense.[18]\r\n\r\nThe implication of the psychic and the logical within both the given\r\npresentation and the thought about it, appears in the continual shift to\r\nwhich logicians of Lotze's type are put. When the psychical is regarded\r\nas existence over against meaning as just ideal, reality seems to reside\r\nin the psychical; it is _there_ anyhow, and meaning is just a curious\r\nattachment--curious because as _mere meaning_ it is non-existent as\r\nevent or state--and there seems to be nothing by which it can be even\r\ntied to the psychical state as its bearer or representative. But when\r\nthe emphasis falls on thought as _content_, as significance, then the\r\npsychic event, the idea as image[19] (as distinct from idea as meaning)\r\nappears as an accidental but necessary evil, the unfortunate irrelevant\r\nmedium through which _our_ thinking has to go on.[20]\r\n\r\n1. _The data of thought._--When we turn to Lotze, we find that he makes\r\na clear distinction between the presented material of thought, its\r\ndatum, and the typical characteristic modes of thinking in virtue of\r\nwhich the datum gets organization or system. It is interesting to note\r\nalso that he states the datum in terms different from those in which the\r\nantecedents of thought are defined. From the point of view of the\r\nmaterial upon which ideas exercise themselves, it is not coincidence,\r\ncollocation, or succession that counts; but gradation of degrees in a\r\nscale. It is not things in spatial or temporal grouping that are\r\nemphasized, but qualities as mutually distinguished, yet classed--as\r\ndifferences of a common somewhat. There is no inherent inconceivability\r\nin the idea that every impression should be as incomparably different\r\nfrom every other as sweet is from warm. But by a remarkable circumstance\r\nsuch is not the case. We have series, and networks of series. We have\r\ndiversity of a common--diverse colors, sounds, smells, tastes, etc. In\r\nother words, the datum is sense-qualities which, fortunately for\r\nthought, are given arranged, as shades, degrees, variations, or\r\nqualities of somewhat that is identical.[21]\r\n\r\nAll this is given, presented, to our ideational activities. Even the\r\nuniversal, the common-color which runs through the various qualities of\r\nblue, green, white, etc., is not a product of thought, but something\r\nwhich thought finds already in existence. It conditions comparison and\r\nreciprocal distinction. Particularly all mathematical determinations,\r\nwhether of counting (number), degree (more or less), and quantity\r\n(greatness and smallness), come back to this peculiarity of the datum of\r\nthought. Here Lotze dwells at considerable length upon the fact that the\r\nvery possibility, as well as the success, of thought is due to this\r\npeculiar universalization or _prima facie_ ordering with which its\r\nmaterial is given to it. Such pre-established fitness in the meeting of\r\ntwo things that have nothing to do with each other is certainly cause\r\nenough for wonder and congratulation.\r\n\r\nIt should not be difficult to see why Lotze uses different categories in\r\ndescribing the given material of thought from those employed in\r\ndescribing its antecedent conditions, even though, according to him, the\r\ntwo are absolutely the same.[22] He has different _functions_ in mind.\r\nIn one case, the material must be characterized as evoking, as\r\nincentive, as stimulus--from this point of view the peculiar combination\r\nof coincidence and coherence is emphasized. But in the other case the\r\nmaterial must be characterized as affording stuff, actual\r\nsubject-matter. Data are not only what is given _to_ thought, but they\r\nare also the food, the raw material, _of_ thought. They must be\r\ndescribed as, on the one hand, wholly outside of thought. This clearly\r\nputs them into the region of sense-perception. They are matter of\r\n_sensation_ given free from all inferring, judging, relating influence.\r\nSensation is just what is _not_ called up in memory or in anticipated\r\nprojection--it is the immediate, the irreducible. On the other hand,\r\nsensory-_matter_ is qualitative, and quales are made up on a common\r\nbasis. They are degrees or grades of a common quality. Thus they have a\r\ncertain ready-made setting of mutual distinction and reference which is\r\nalready almost, if not quite, the effect of comparing, of relating, and\r\nthese are the express traits of thinking.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to interpret this miraculous gift of grace in the light of\r\nwhat has been said. The data are in truth precisely that which is\r\nselected and set aside _as_ present, as immediate. Thus they are _given_\r\nto _further_ thought. But the selection has occurred in view of the need\r\nfor thought; it is a listing of the capital in the way of the\r\nundisturbed, the undiscussed, which thought can count upon in this\r\nparticular problem. Hence it is not strange that it has a peculiar\r\nfitness of adaptation for thought's further work. Having been selected\r\nwith precisely that end in view, the wonder would be if it were not so\r\nfitted. A man may coin counterfeit money for use upon others, but hardly\r\nwith the intent of passing it off upon himself.\r\n\r\nOur only difficulty here is that the mind flies away from the logical\r\ninterpretation of sense-datum to a ready-made notion of it brought over\r\nfrom abstract psychological inquiry. The belief in sensory quales as\r\nsomehow forced upon us, and forced upon us at large, and thus\r\nconditioning thought wholly _ab extra_, instead of determining it as\r\ninstrumentalities or elements in its own scheme, is too fixed. Such\r\nqualities _are_ forced upon us, but _not_ at large. The sensory data of\r\nexperience, as distinct from the psychologists' constructs, always come\r\n_in a context_; they always appear as variations in a continuum of\r\nvalues. Even the thunder which breaks in upon me (to take the extreme of\r\napparent discontinuity and irrelevancy) disturbs me because it is taken\r\nas a part of the same space-world as that in which my chair and room and\r\nhouse are located; and it is taken as an influence which interrupts and\r\ndisturbs, _because_ it is part of my common world of causes and effects.\r\nThe solution of continuity is itself practical or teleological, and thus\r\npresupposes and affects continuity of purpose, occupations, and means in\r\na life-process. It is not metaphysics, it is biology which enforces the\r\nidea that actual sensation is not only determined as an event in a world\r\nof events,[23] but is an occurrence occurring at a certain period in the\r\nevolution of experience, marking a certain point in its cycle, and,\r\nconsequently--having always its own conscious context and bearings--is a\r\ncharacteristic function of reconstruction in experience.[24]\r\n\r\n2. _Forms of thinking data._--As sensory datum is material set for the\r\nwork of thought, so the ideational forms with which thought does its\r\nwork are apt and prompt to meet the needs of the material. The\r\n\"accessory\"[25] notion of ground of coherence turns out, in truth, not\r\nto be a formal, or external, addition to the data, but a requalification\r\nof them. Thought is accessory as accomplice, not as addendum. \"Thought\"\r\nis to eliminate mere coincidence, and to assert grounded coherence.\r\nLotze makes it absolutely clear that he does not at bottom conceive of\r\n\"thought\" as an activity \"in itself\" imposing a form of coherence; but\r\nthat the organizing work of \"thought\" is only the progressive\r\nrealization of an inherent unity, or system, in the material experience.\r\nThe specific modes in which thought brings its \"accessory\" power to\r\nbear--names, conception, judgment, and inference--are successive stages\r\nin the adequate organization of the matter which comes to us first as\r\ndatum; they are successive stages of the effort to overcome the\r\noriginal defects of the datum. Conception starts from the given\r\nuniversal (the common element) of sense. Yet (and this is the\r\nsignificant point) it does not simply abstract this common element, and\r\nconsciously generalize it as over against its own differences. Such a\r\n\"universal\" is _not_ coherence, just because it does not _include_ and\r\ndominate the temporal and local heterogeneity. The _true_ concept (see\r\nVol. I, p. 38) is a system of attributes, held together on the basis of\r\nsome ground, or determining, dominating principle--a ground which so\r\ncontrols all its own instances as to make them into an inwardly\r\nconnected whole, and so specifies its own limits as to be exclusive of\r\nall else. If we abstract color as the common element of various colors,\r\nthe result is not a scientific idea or concept. Discovery of a process\r\nof light-waves whose various rates constitute the various colors of the\r\nspectrum gives the concept. And when we get such a concept, the former\r\nmere temporal abruptness of color experiences gives way to organic parts\r\nof a color system. The logical product--the concept, in other words--is\r\nnot a formal seal or stamp; it is a thoroughgoing transformation of data\r\nin a given sense.\r\n\r\nThe form or mode of thought which marks the continued transformation of\r\nthe data and the idea in reference to each other is judgment. Judgment\r\nmakes explicit the assumption of a principle which determines connection\r\nwithin an individualized whole. It definitely states red as _this_ case\r\nor instance of the law or process of color, and thus overcomes further\r\nthe defect in _subject-matter_ or data still left by conception.[26] Now\r\njudgment logically terminates in disjunction. It gives a universal\r\nwhich may determine any one of a number of alternative defined\r\nparticulars, but which is arbitrary as to _what_ one is selected.\r\nSystematic _inference_ brings to light the material conditions under\r\nwhich the law, or dominating universal, applies to this, rather than\r\nthat alternative particular, and so completes the ideal organization of\r\nthe subject-matter. If this act were complete, we should finally have\r\npresent to us a whole on which we should know the determining and\r\neffective or authorizing elements, and the order of development or\r\nhierarchy of dependence, in which others follow from them.[27]\r\n\r\nIn this account by Lotze of the operations of the forms of thought,\r\nthere is clearly put before us the picture of a continuous correlative\r\ndetermination of datum on one side and of idea or meaning on the other,\r\ntill experience is again integral, data thoroughly defined and\r\ncorrected, and ideas completely incarnate as the relevant meaning of\r\nsubject-matter. That we have here in outline a description of what\r\nactually occurs there can be no doubt. But there is as little doubt that\r\nit is thoroughly inconsistent with Lotze's supposition that the material\r\nor data of thought is precisely the same as the antecedents of thought;\r\nor that ideas, conceptions, are purely mental somewhats brought to bear,\r\nas the sole essential characteristics of thought, extraneously upon a\r\nmaterial provided ready-made. It means but one thing: The maintenance of\r\nunity and wholeness in experience through conflicting contents occurs by\r\nmeans of a strictly correspondent setting apart of fact to be accurately\r\ndescribed and properly related, and meaning to be adequately construed\r\nand properly referred. The datum is given _in_ the thought-situation,\r\nand _to_ further qualification of ideas or meanings. But even in this\r\naspect it presents a problem. To find out _what is_ given is an inquiry\r\nwhich taxes reflection to the uttermost. Every important advance in\r\nscientific method means better agencies, more skilled technique for\r\nsimply detaching and describing what is barely there, or given. To be\r\nable to find out what can safely be taken as _there_, as given in any\r\nparticular inquiry, and hence be taken as material for orderly and\r\nverifiable thinking, for fruitful hypothesis-making, for entertaining of\r\nexplanatory and interpretative ideas, is one phase of the effort of\r\nsystematic scientific inquiry. It marks its inductive phase. To take\r\nwhat is given _in_ the thought-situation, for the sake of accomplishing\r\nthe aim of thought (along with a correlative discrimination of ideas or\r\nmeanings), as if it were given absolutely, or apart from a particular\r\nhistoric situs and context, is the fallacy of empiricism as a logical\r\ntheory. To regard the thought-forms of conception, judgment, and\r\ninference as qualifications of \"pure thought, apart from any difference\r\nin objects,\" instead of as successive dispositions in the progressive\r\norganization of the material (or objects) is the fallacy of rationalism.\r\nLotze attempts to combine the two, thinking thereby to correct each by\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nLotze recognizes the futility of thought if the sense-data are final, if\r\nthey alone are real, the truly existent, self-justificatory and valid.\r\nHe sees that, if the empiricist were right in his assumption as to the\r\nreal worth of the given data, thinking would be a ridiculous pretender,\r\neither toilfully and poorly doing over again what needs no doing, or\r\nmaking a wilful departure from truth. He realizes that thought really is\r\nevoked because it is needed, and that it has a work to do which is not\r\nmerely formal, but which effects a modification of the subject-matter of\r\nexperience. Consequently he assumes a thought-in-itself, with certain\r\nforms and modes of action of its own, a realm of meaning possessed of a\r\ndirective and normative worth of its own--the root-fallacy of\r\nrationalism. His attempted compromise between the two turns out to be\r\nbased on the assumption of the indefensible ideas of both--the notion of\r\nan independent matter of thought, on one side, and of an independent\r\nworth or value of thought-forms, on the other.\r\n\r\nThis pointing out of inconsistencies becomes stale and unprofitable save\r\nas we bring them back into connection with their root-origin--the\r\nerection of distinctions that are genetic and historic, and working or\r\ninstrumental divisions of labor, into rigid and ready-made differences\r\nof structural reality. Lotze clearly recognizes that thought's nature is\r\ndependent upon its aim, its aim upon its problem, and this upon the\r\nsituation in which it finds its incentive and excuse. Its work is cut\r\nout for it. It does not what it would, but what it must. As Lotze puts\r\nit, \"Logic has to do with thought, not as it would be under\r\nhypothetical conditions, but as it is\" (Vol. I, p. 33), and this\r\nstatement is made in explicit combination with statements to the effect\r\nthat the peculiarity of the material of thought conditions its activity.\r\nSimilarly he says in a passage already referred to: \"The possibility and\r\nthe success of thought's production in general depends upon this\r\noriginal constitution and organization of the whole world of ideas, a\r\nconstitution which, though not necessary in thought, is all the more\r\nnecessary to make thought possible.\"[28]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the essential nature of conception, judgment, and\r\ninference is dependent upon peculiarities of the propounded material,\r\nthey being forms dependent for their significance upon the stage of\r\norganization in which they begin.\r\n\r\nFrom this only one conclusion is suggested. If thought's nature is\r\ndependent upon its actual conditions and circumstances, the primary\r\nlogical problem is to study thought-in-its-conditioning; it is to detect\r\nthe crisis within which thought and its subject-matter present\r\nthemselves in their mutual distinction and cross-reference. But Lotze is\r\nso thoroughly committed to a ready-made antecedent of some sort, that\r\nthis genetic consideration is of no account to him. The historic method\r\nis a mere matter of psychology, and has no logical worth (Vol. I, p. 2).\r\nWe must presuppose a psychological mechanism and psychological material,\r\nbut logic is concerned not with origin or history, but with authority,\r\nworth, value (Vol. I, p. 10). Again: \"Logic is not concerned with the\r\nmanner in which the elements utilized by thought come into existence,\r\nbut their value _after_ they have somehow come into existence, for the\r\ncarrying out of intellectual operations\" (Vol. I, p. 34). And finally:\r\n\"I have maintained throughout my work that logic cannot derive any\r\nserious advantage from a discussion of _the conditions under which\r\nthought as a psychological process comes about_. The significance of\r\nlogical forms ... is to be found in the utterances of thought, the laws\r\nwhich it imposes, after or during the act of thinking, not in the\r\nconditions which lie back of and which produce thought.\"[29]\r\n\r\nLotze, in truth, represents a halting-stage in the evolution of logical\r\ntheory. He is too far along to be contented with the reiteration of the\r\npurely formal distinctions of a merely formal thought-by-itself. He\r\nrecognizes that thought as formal is the form of some matter, and has\r\nits worth only as organizing that matter to meet the ideal demands of\r\nreason; and that \"reason\" is in truth only an ideal systematization of\r\nthe matter or content. Consequently he has to open the door to admit\r\n\"psychical processes\" which furnish this material. Having let in the\r\nmaterial, he is bound to shut the door again in the face of the\r\nprocesses from which the material proceeded--to dismiss them as\r\nimpertinent intruders. If thought gets its data in such a surreptitious\r\nmanner, there is no occasion for wonder that the legitimacy of its\r\ndealings with the material remains an open question. Logical theory,\r\nlike every branch of the philosophic disciplines, waits upon a surrender\r\nof the obstinate conviction that, while the work and aim of thought is\r\nconditioned by the material supplied to it, yet the _worth_ of its\r\nperformances is something to be passed upon in complete abstraction from\r\nconditions of origin and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT AND ITS SUBJECT-MATTER: THE CONTENT AND OBJECT OF THOUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing discussion, particularly in the last chapter, we were\r\nled repeatedly to recognize that thought has its own content. At times\r\nLotze gives way to the tendency to define thought entirely in terms of\r\nmodes and forms of activity which are exercised by it upon a strictly\r\nforeign material. But two motives continually push him in the other\r\ndirection. (1) Thought has a distinctive work to do, one which involves\r\na qualitative transformation of (at least) the _relationships_ of the\r\npresented matter; as fast as it accomplishes this work, the\r\nsubject-matter becomes somehow thought's own. As we have just seen, the\r\ndata are progressively organized to meet thought's ideal of a complete\r\nwhole, with its members interconnected according to a determining\r\nprinciple. Such progressive organization throws backward doubt upon the\r\nassumption of the original total irrelevancy of the data and\r\nthought-form to each other. (2) A like motive operates from the side of\r\nthe subject-matter. As merely foreign and external, it is too\r\nheterogeneous to lend itself to thought's exercise and influence. The\r\nidea, as we saw in the first chapter, is the convenient medium through\r\nwhich Lotze passes from the purely heterogeneous psychical impression or\r\nevent, which is totally irrelevant to thought's purpose and working,\r\nover to a state of affairs which can reward thought. Idea as meaning\r\nforms the bridge from the brute factuality of the psychical impression\r\nover to the coherent value of thought's own content.\r\n\r\nWe have, in this chapter, to consider the question of the idea or\r\ncontent of thought from two points of view: first, the _possibility_ of\r\nsuch a content--its consistency with Lotze's fundamental premises;\r\nsecondly, its _objective_ character--its validity and test.\r\n\r\nI. The question of the possibility of a specific content of thought is\r\nthe question of the nature of the idea as meaning. Meaning is the\r\ncharacteristic content of thought as such. We have thus far left\r\nunquestioned Lotze's continual assumption of meaning as a sort of\r\nthought-unit; the building-stone of thought's construction. In his\r\ntreatment of meaning, Lotze's contradictions regarding the antecedents,\r\ndata, and content of thought reach their full conclusion. He expressly\r\nmakes meaning to be the product of thought's activity and also the\r\nunreflective material out of which thought's operations grow.\r\n\r\nThis contradiction has been worked out in accurate and complete detail\r\nby Professor Jones.[30] He summarizes it as follows (p. 99): \"No other\r\nway was left to him [Lotze] excepting this of first attributing all to\r\nsense and afterwards attributing all to thought, and, finally of\r\nattributing it to thought only because it was already in its material.\r\nThis _seesaw_ is essential to his theory; the elements of knowledge as\r\nhe describes them can subsist only by the alternate robbery of each\r\nother.\" We have already seen how strenuously Lotze insists upon the fact\r\nthat the given subject-matter of thought is to be regarded wholly as the\r\nwork of a physical mechanism, \"without any action of thought.\"[31] But\r\nLotze also states that if the products of the psychical mechanism \"are\r\nto admit of combination in the definite form of a _thought_, they each\r\nrequire some previous shaping to make them into logical building-stones\r\nand to convert them from _impressions_ into _ideas_. Nothing is really\r\nmore familiar to us than this first operation of thought; the only\r\nreason why we usually overlook it is that in the language which we\r\ninherit, it is already carried out, and it seems, therefore, to belong\r\nto the self-evident presuppositions of thought, _not to its own specific\r\nwork_.\"[32] And again (Vol. I, p. 23) judgments \"can consist of nothing\r\nbut combinations of ideas which are no longer mere impressions: every\r\nsuch idea must have undergone at least the simple formation mentioned\r\nabove.\" Such ideas are, Lotze goes on to urge, already rudimentary\r\nconcepts--that is to say, logical determinations.\r\n\r\nThe obviousness of the logical contradiction of attributing to a\r\npreliminary specific work of thought exactly the condition of affairs\r\nwhich is elsewhere explicitly attributed to a psychical mechanism prior\r\nto any thought-activity, should not blind us to its meaning and relative\r\nnecessity. The impression, it will be recalled, is a mere state of our\r\nown consciousness--a mood of ourselves. As such it has simply _de facto_\r\nrelations as an event to other similar events. But reflective thought is\r\nconcerned with the relationship of a content or matter to other\r\ncontents. Hence the impression must have a matter before it can come at\r\nall within the sphere of thought's exercise. How shall it secure this?\r\nWhy, by a preliminary activity of thought which objectifies the\r\nimpression. Blue as a mere sensuous irritation or feeling is given a\r\nquality, the meaning \"blue\"--blueness; the sense-impression is\r\nobjectified; it is presented \"no longer as a condition which we undergo,\r\nbut as a something which has its being and its meaning in itself, and\r\nwhich continues to be what it is, and to mean what it means whether we\r\nare conscious of it or not. It is easy to see here the _necessary\r\nbeginning of that activity which we above appropriated to thought as\r\nsuch_: it has not yet got so far as converting coexistence into\r\ncoherence. It has first to perform the previous task of investing each\r\nsingle impression with an independent validity, without which the later\r\nopposition of their real coherence to mere coexistence could not be made\r\nin any intelligible sense.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThis objectification, which converts a sensitive state into a sensible\r\nmatter to which the sensitive state is referred, also gives this matter\r\n\"position,\" a certain typical character. It is not objectified in a\r\nmerely general way, but is given a specific sort of objectivity. Of\r\nthese kinds of objectivity there are three mentioned: that of a\r\nsubstantive content; that of an attached dependent content; that of an\r\nactive relationship connecting the various contents with each other. In\r\nshort, we have the types of meaning embodied in language in the form of\r\nnouns, adjectives, and verbs. It is through this preliminary formative\r\nactivity of thought that reflective or _logical_ thought has presented\r\nto it a world of meanings ranged in an order of relative independence\r\nand dependence, and ranged as elements in a complex of meanings whose\r\nvarious constituent parts mutually influence each other's meanings.[34]\r\n\r\nAs usual, Lotze mediates the contradiction between material constituted\r\n_by_ thought and the same material just presented _to_ thought, by a\r\nfurther position so disparate to each that, taken in connection with\r\neach in a pair, and by turns, it seems to bridge the gulf. After\r\ndescribing the prior constitutive work of thought as above, he goes on\r\nto discuss a _second_ phase of thought which is intermediary between\r\nthis and the third phase, viz., reflective thought proper. This second\r\nactivity is that of arranging experienced quales in series and groups,\r\nthus ascribing a sort of universal or common somewhat to various\r\ninstances (as already described; see p. 55). On one hand, it is clearly\r\nstated that this second phase of thought's activity is in reality the\r\n_same_ as the first phase: since all objectification involves positing,\r\nsince positing involves distinction of one matter from others, and since\r\nthis involves placing it in a series or group in which each is\r\nmeasurably marked off, as to the degree and nature of its diversity,\r\nfrom every other. We are told that we are only considering \"a really\r\ninseparable operation\" of thought from two different sides: first, as to\r\nthe effect which objectifying thought has upon the matter as set over\r\nagainst the feeling _subject_, secondly, the effect which this\r\nobjectification has upon the matter in relation to _other matters_.[35]\r\nAfterward, however, these two operations are declared to be radically\r\ndifferent in type and nature. The first is determinant and formative; it\r\ngives ideas \"the shape without which the logical spirit could not accept\r\nthem.\" In a way it dictates \"its own laws to its object-matter.\"[36] The\r\nsecond activity of thought is rather passive and receptive. It simply\r\nrecognizes what is already there. \"Thought can make no difference where\r\nit finds none already in the matter of impressions.\"[37] \"The first\r\nuniversal, as we saw, can only be experienced in immediate sensation. It\r\nis no product of thought, but something that thought finds already in\r\nexistence.\"[38]\r\n\r\nThe obviousness of this further contradiction is paralleled only by its\r\ninevitableness. Thought is in the air, is arbitrary and wild in dealing\r\nwith meanings, unless it gets its start and cue from actual experience.\r\nHence the necessity of insisting upon thought's activity as just\r\nrecognizing the contents already given. But, on the other hand, prior to\r\nthe work of thought there is to Lotze no content or meaning. It requires\r\na work of thought to detach anything from the flux of sense-irritations\r\nand invest it with a meaning of its own. This dilemma is inevitable to\r\nany writer who declines to consider as correlative the nature of\r\nthought-activity and thought-content from the standpoint of their\r\ngenerating conditions in the movement of experience. Viewed from such a\r\nstandpoint the principle of solution is clear enough. As we have already\r\nseen (p. 53), the internal dissension of an experience leads to\r\ndetaching certain values previously absorptively integrated into the\r\nconcrete experience as part of its own qualitative coloring; and to\r\nrelegating them, for the time being, (pending integration into further\r\nimmediate values of a reconstituted experience) into a world of bare\r\nmeanings, a sphere qualified as ideal throughout. These meanings then\r\nbecome the tools of thought in interpreting the data, just as the\r\nsense-qualities which define the presented situation are the immediate\r\nobject to thought. The two _as mutually referred_ are content. That is,\r\nthe datum and the thought-mode or idea as connected are the object of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nTo reach this unification is thought's objective or goal. Exactly the\r\nsame value is idea, as either tool or content, according as it is taken\r\nas instrumental or as accomplishment. Every successive cross-section of\r\nthe thought-situation presents what may be taken for granted as the\r\noutcome of previous thinking, and consequently as the determinant of\r\nfurther reflective procedure. Taken as defining the point reached in the\r\nthought-function and serving as constituent unit of further thought, it\r\nis content. Lotze's instinct is sure in identifying and setting over\r\nagainst each other the material given to thought and the content which\r\nis thought's own \"building-stone.\" His contradictions arise simply from\r\nthe fact that his absolute, non-historic method does not permit him to\r\ninterpret this joint identity and distinction in a working, and hence\r\nrelative, sense.\r\n\r\nII. The question of how the possibility of meanings, or\r\nthought-contents, is to be understood merges imperceptibly into the\r\nquestion of the real objectivity or validity of such contents. The\r\ndifficulty for Lotze is the now familiar one: So far as his logic\r\ncompels him to insist that these meanings are the possession and product\r\nof thought (since thought is an independent activity), the ideas are\r\nmerely ideas; there is no test of objectivity beyond the thoroughly\r\nunsatisfactory and formal one of their own mutual consistency. In\r\nreaction from this Lotze is thrown back upon the idea of these contents\r\nas the original matter given in the impressions themselves. Here there\r\nseems to be an objective or external test by which the reality of\r\nthought's operations may be tried; a given idea is verified or found\r\nfalse according to its measure of correspondence with the matter of\r\nexperience as such. But now we are no better off. The original\r\nindependence and heterogeneity of impressions and of thought is so great\r\nthat there is no way to compare the results of the latter with the\r\nformer. We cannot compare or contrast distinctions of worth with bare\r\ndifferences of factual existence (Vol. I, p. 2). The standard or test of\r\nobjectivity is so thoroughly external that by original definition it is\r\nwholly outside the realm of thought. How can thought compare its own\r\ncontents with that which is wholly outside itself?\r\n\r\nOr again, the given material of experience apart from thought is\r\nprecisely the relatively chaotic and unorganized; it even reduces itself\r\nto a mere sequence of psychical events. What rational meaning is there\r\nin directing us to compare the highest results of scientific inquiry\r\nwith the bare sequence of our own states of feeling; or even with the\r\noriginal data whose fragmentary and uncertain character was the exact\r\nmotive for entering upon scientific inquiry? How can the former in any\r\nsense give a check or test of the value of the latter? This is\r\nprofessedly to test the validity of a system of meanings by comparison\r\nwith that whose defects and errors call forth the construction of the\r\nsystem of meanings by which to rectify and replace themselves. Our\r\nsubsequent inquiry simply consists in tracing some of the phases of the\r\ncharacteristic seesaw from one to the other of the two horns of the now\r\nfamiliar dilemma: either thought is separate from the matter of\r\nexperience, and then its validity is wholly its own private business; or\r\nelse the objective results of thought are already in the antecedent\r\nmaterial, and then thought is either unnecessary, or else has no way of\r\nchecking its own performances.\r\n\r\n1. Lotze assumes, as we have seen, a certain independent validity in\r\neach meaning or qualified content, taken in and of itself. \"Blue\" has a\r\ncertain validity, or meaning, in and of itself; it is an object for\r\nconsciousness as such. After the original sense-irritation through which\r\nit was mediated has entirely disappeared, it persists as a valid idea,\r\nas a meaning. Moreover, it is an object or content of thought for others\r\nas well. Thus it has a double mark of validity: in the comparison of one\r\npart of my own experience with another, and in the comparison of my\r\nexperience as a whole with that of others. Here we have a sort of\r\nvalidity which does not raise at all the question of _metaphysical_\r\nreality (Vol. I, pp. 14, 15). Lotze thus seems to have escaped from the\r\nnecessity of employing as check or test for the validity of ideas any\r\nreference to a real outside the sphere of thought itself. Such terms as\r\n\"conjunction,\" \"franchise,\" \"constitution,\" \"algebraic zero,\" etc.,\r\netc., claim to possess objective validity. Yet none of these professes\r\nto refer to a reality beyond thought. Generalizing this point of view,\r\nvalidity or objectivity of meaning means simply that which is \"identical\r\nfor all consciousness\" (Vol. I, p. 3); \"it is quite indifferent whether\r\ncertain parts of the world of thought indicate something which has\r\nbeside an independent reality outside of thinking minds, or whether all\r\nthat it contains exists only in the thoughts of those who think it, but\r\nwith equal validity for them all\" (Vol. I, p. 16).\r\n\r\nSo far it seems clear sailing. Difficulties, however, show themselves,\r\nthe moment we inquire what is meant by a self-identical content for all\r\nthought. Is this to be taken in a static or in a dynamic way? That is to\r\nsay: Does it express the fact that a given content or meaning is _de\r\nfacto_ presented to the consciousness of all alike? Does this coequal\r\npresence guarantee an objectivity? Or does validity attach to a given\r\nmeaning or content in so far as it directs and controls the further\r\nexercise of thinking, and thus the formation of further _new_ contents\r\nof consciousness?\r\n\r\nThe former interpretation is alone consistent with Lotze's notion that\r\nthe independent idea as such is invested with a certain validity or\r\nobjectivity. It alone is consistent with his assertion that concepts\r\nprecede judgments. It alone, that is to say, is consistent with the\r\nnotion that reflective thinking has a sphere of ideas or meanings\r\nsupplied to it at the outset. But it is impossible to entertain this\r\nbelief. The stimulus which, according to Lotze, goads thought on from\r\nideas or concepts to judgments and inferences, is in truth simply the\r\nlack of validity, of objectivity in its original independent meanings or\r\ncontents. A meaning as independent is precisely that which is not\r\ninvested with validity, but which is a mere idea, a \"notion,\" a fancy,\r\nat best a surmise which may turn out to be valid (and of course this\r\nindicates possible reference); a standpoint to have its value determined\r\nby its further active use. \"Blue\" as a mere detached floating meaning,\r\nan idea at large, would not gain in validity simply by being entertained\r\ncontinuously in a given consciousness; or by being made at one and the\r\nsame time the persistent object of attentive regard by all human\r\nconsciousnesses. If this were all that were required, the chimera, the\r\ncentaur, or any other subjective construction, could easily gain\r\nvalidity. \"Christian Science\" has made just this notion the basis of its\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact is that in such illustrations as \"blue,\" \"franchise,\"\r\n\"conjunction,\" Lotze instinctively takes cases which are not mere\r\nindependent and detached meanings, but which involve reference to a\r\nregion of cosmic experience, or to a region of mutually determining\r\nsocial activities. The conception that reference to a _social_ activity\r\ndoes not involve the same sort of reference of thought beyond itself\r\nthat is involved in physical matters, and hence may be taken quite\r\ninnocent and free of the metaphysical problem of reference to reality\r\nbeyond meaning, is one of the strangest that has ever found lodgment in\r\nhuman thinking. Either both physical and social reference or neither, is\r\nmetaphysical; if neither, then it is because the meaning functions, as\r\nit originates, in a specific situation which carries with it its own\r\ntests (see p. 17). Lotze's conception is made possible only by\r\nunconsciously substituting the idea of object as content of thought for\r\na large number of persons (or a _de facto_ somewhat for every\r\nconsciousness), for the genuine definition of object as a determinant in\r\na scheme of experience. The former is consistent with Lotze's conception\r\nof thought, but wholly indeterminate as to validity or intent. The\r\nlatter is the test used experimentally in all concrete thinking, but\r\ninvolves a radical transformation of all Lotze's assumptions. A given\r\nidea of the conjunction of the franchise, or of blue, is valid, not\r\nbecause everybody happens to entertain it, but because it expresses the\r\nfactor of control or direction in a given movement of experience. The\r\ntest of validity of idea[39] is its functional or instrumental use in\r\neffecting the transition from a relatively conflicting experience to a\r\nrelatively integrated one. If Lotze's view were correct, \"blue\" valid\r\nonce would be valid always--even when red or green were actually called\r\nfor to fulfil specific conditions. This is to say validity always refers\r\nto rightfulness or adequacy of performance in an asserting of\r\nconnection--not to the meaning as detached and contemplated.\r\n\r\nIf we refer again to the fact that the genuine antecedent of thought is\r\na situation which is tensional as regards its existing status, or\r\ndisorganized in its structural elements, yet organized as emerging out\r\nof the unified experience of the past and as striving as a whole, or\r\nequally in all its phases, to reinstate an experience harmonized in\r\nmake-up, we can easily understand how certain contents may be detached\r\nand held apart as meanings or references, actual or possible (according\r\nas they are viewed with reference to the past or to the future). We can\r\nunderstand how such detached contents may be of use in effecting a\r\nreview of the entire experience, and as affording standpoints and\r\nmethods of a reconstruction which will maintain the integrity of\r\nexperience. We can understand how validity of meaning is measured by\r\nreference to something which is not mere meaning; by reference to\r\nsomething which lies beyond the idea as such--viz., the reconstitution\r\nof an experience into which thought enters as mediator. That paradox of\r\nordinary experience and of scientific inquiry by which objectivity is\r\ngiven alike to matter of perception and to conceived relations--to\r\nfacts and to laws--affords no peculiar difficulty, because we see that\r\nthe test of objectivity is everywhere the same: anything is objective in\r\nso far as, through the medium of conflict, it controls the movement of\r\nexperience in its reconstructive transition from one unified form to\r\nanother. There is not first an object, whether of sense-perception or of\r\nconception, which afterward somehow exercises this controlling\r\ninfluence; but the objective is such in virtue of the exercise of\r\nfunction of control. It may only control the act of inquiry; it may only\r\nset on foot doubt, but this is direction of subsequent experience, and,\r\nin so far, is a token of objectivity.\r\n\r\nSo much for the thought-content or meaning as having a validity of its\r\nown. It does not have it as isolated or given or static; it has it in\r\nits dynamic reference, its use in determining further movement of\r\nexperience. In other words, the \"meaning\" or idea as such, having been\r\nselected and made-up with reference to performing a certain office in\r\nthe evolution of a unified experience, can be tested in no other way\r\nthan by discovering whether it does what it was intended to do and what\r\nit purports to do.[40]\r\n\r\n2. Lotze has to wrestle with this question of validity in a further\r\naspect: What constitutes the objectivity of thinking as a total\r\nattitude, activity, or function? According to his own statement, the\r\nmeanings or valid ideas are after all only building-stones for logical\r\nthought. Validity is thus not a question of them in their independent\r\nexistences, but of their mutual reference to each other. Thinking is the\r\nprocess of instituting these mutual references; of building up the\r\nvarious scattered and independent building-stones into the coherent\r\nsystem of thought. What is the validity of the various forms of thinking\r\nwhich find expression in the various types of judgment and in the\r\nvarious forms of inference? Categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive\r\njudgment; inference by induction, by analogy, by mathematical equation;\r\nclassification, theory of explanation--all these are processes of\r\nreflection by which mutual connection in an individualized whole is\r\ngiven to the fragmentary meanings or ideas with which thought as it sets\r\nout is supplied. What shall we say of the validity of such processes?\r\n\r\nOn one point Lotze is quite clear. These various logical acts do not\r\nreally enter into the constitution of the valid world. The logical forms\r\nas such are maintained _only_ in the process of thinking. The world of\r\nvalid truth does not undergo a series of contortions and evolutions,\r\nparalleling in any way the successive steps and missteps, the succession\r\nof tentative trials, withdrawals, and retracings, which mark the course\r\nof our own thinking.[41]\r\n\r\nLotze is explicit upon the point that it is only the thought-content in\r\nwhich the process of thinking issues that has objective validity; the\r\nact of thinking is \"purely and simply an inner movement of our own\r\nminds, made necessary to us by reason of the constitution of our nature\r\nand of our place in the world\" (Vol. II, p. 279).\r\n\r\nHere the problem of validity presents itself as the problem of the\r\nrelation of the act of thinking to its own product. In his solution\r\nLotze uses two metaphors: one derived from building operations, the\r\nother from traveling. The construction of a building requires of\r\nnecessity certain tools and extraneous constructions, stagings,\r\nscaffoldings, etc., which are necessary to effect the final\r\nconstruction, but yet which do not enter into the building as such. The\r\nactivity has an instrumental, though not a constitutive, value as\r\nregards its product. Similarly, in order to get a view from the top of a\r\nmountain--this view being the objective--the traveler has to go through\r\npreliminary movements along devious courses. These again are antecedent\r\nprerequisites, but do not constitute a portion of the attained view.\r\n\r\nThe problem of thought as activity, as distinct from thought as content,\r\nopens up altogether too large a question to receive complete\r\nconsideration at this point. Fortunately, however, the previous\r\ndiscussion enables us to narrow the point which is in issue just here.\r\nIt is once more the question whether the activity of thought is to be\r\nregarded as an independent function supervening entirely from without\r\nupon antecedents, and directed from without upon data; or whether it\r\nmarks merely a phase of the transformation which the course of\r\nexperience (whether practical, or artistic, or socially affectional or\r\nwhatever) undergoes in entering into a tensional status where the\r\nmaintenance of its harmony of content is problematic and hence an aim.\r\nIf it be the latter, a thoroughly intelligent sense can be given to the\r\nproposition that the activity of thinking is instrumental, and that its\r\nworth is found, not in its own successive states as such, but in the\r\nresult in which it comes to conclusion. But the conception of thinking\r\nas an independent activity somehow occurring after an independent\r\nantecedent, playing upon an independent subject-matter, and finally\r\neffecting an independent result, presents us with just one miracle the\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI do not question the strictly instrumental character of thinking. The\r\nproblem lies not here, but in the interpretation of the nature of the\r\norgan and instrument. The difficulty with Lotze's position is that it\r\nforces us into the assumption of a means and an end which are simply and\r\nonly external to each other, and yet necessarily dependent upon each\r\nother--a position which, whenever found, is so thoroughly\r\nself-contradictory as to necessitate critical reconsideration of the\r\npremises which lead to it. Lotze vibrates between the notion of thought\r\nas a tool in the external sense, a mere scaffolding to a finished\r\nbuilding in which it has no part nor lot, and the notion of thought as\r\nan immanent tool, as a scaffolding which is an integral part of the very\r\noperation of building, and set up for the sake of the building-activity\r\nwhich is carried on effectively only with and through a scaffolding.\r\nOnly in the former case can the scaffolding be considered as a _mere_\r\ntool. In the latter case the external scaffolding is not itself the\r\ninstrumentality; the actual tool is the _action_ of erecting the\r\nbuilding, and this action involves the scaffolding as a constituent part\r\nof itself. The work of erecting is not set over against the completed\r\nbuilding as mere means to an end; it _is_ the end taken in process or\r\nhistorically, longitudinally viewed. The scaffolding, moreover, is not\r\nan external means to the process of erecting, but an organic member of\r\nit. It is no mere accident of language that \"building\" has a double\r\nsense--meaning at once the process and the finished product. The outcome\r\nof thought is the thinking activity carried on to its own completion;\r\nthe activity, on the other hand, _is_ the outcome taken anywhere short\r\nof its own realization, and thereby still going on.\r\n\r\nThe only consideration which prevents easy and immediate acceptance of\r\nthis view is the notion of thinking as something purely formal. It is\r\nstrange that the empiricist does not see that his insistence upon a\r\nmatter extraneously given to thought only strengthens the hands of the\r\nrationalist with his claim of thinking as an independent activity,\r\nseparate from the actual make-up of the affairs of experience. Thinking\r\nas a merely formal activity exercised upon certain sensations or images\r\nor objects sets forth an absolutely meaningless proposition. The\r\npsychological identification of thinking with the process of association\r\nis much nearer the truth. It is, indeed, on the way to the truth. We\r\nneed only to recognize that association is of contents or matters or\r\nmeanings, not of ideas as bare existences or events; and that the type\r\nof association we call thinking differs from the associations of casual\r\nfancy and revery in an element of control by reference to an end which\r\ndetermines the fitness and thus the selection of the associates, to\r\napprehend how completely thinking is a reconstructive movement of actual\r\ncontents of experience in relation to each other, and for the sake of a\r\nredintegration of a conflicting experience.\r\n\r\nThere is no miracle in the fact that tool and material are adapted to\r\neach other in the process of reaching a valid conclusion. Were they\r\nexternal in origin to each other and to the result, the whole affair\r\nwould, indeed, present an insoluble problem--so insoluble that, if this\r\nwere the true condition of affairs, we never should even know that there\r\nwas a problem. But, in truth, both material and tool have been secured\r\nand determined with reference to economy and efficiency in effecting the\r\nend desired--the maintenance of a harmonious experience. The builder has\r\ndiscovered that his building means building tools, and also building\r\nmaterial. Each has been slowly evolved with reference to its fit employ\r\nin the entire function; and this evolution has been checked at every\r\npoint by reference to its own correspondent. The carpenter has not\r\nthought at large on his building and then constructed tools at large,\r\nbut has thought of his building in terms of the material which enters\r\ninto it, and through that medium has come to the consideration of the\r\ntools which are helpful. Life proposes to maintain at all hazards the\r\nunity of its own process. Experience insists on being itself, on\r\nsecuring integrity even through and by means of conflict.\r\n\r\nThis is not a formal question, but one of the placing and relations of\r\nthe matters or values actually entering into experience. And this in\r\nturn determines the taking up of just those mental attitudes, and the\r\nemploying of just those intellectual operations, which most effectively\r\nhandle and organize the material. Thinking is adaptation _to_ an end\r\n_through_ the adjustment of particular objective contents.\r\n\r\nThe thinker, like the carpenter, is at once stimulated and checked in\r\nevery stage of his procedure by the particular situation which confronts\r\nhim. A person is at the stage of wanting a new house: well then, his\r\nmaterials are available resources, the price of labor, the cost of\r\nbuilding, the state and needs of his family, profession, etc.; his tools\r\nare paper and pencil and compass, or possibly the bank as a credit\r\ninstrumentality, etc. Again, the work is beginning. The foundations are\r\nlaid. This in turn determines its own specific materials and tools.\r\nAgain, the building is almost ready for occupancy. The concrete process\r\nis that of taking away the scaffolding, clearing up the grounds,\r\nfurnishing and decorating rooms, etc. This specific operation again\r\ndetermines its own fit or relevant materials and tools. It defines the\r\ntime and mode and manner of beginning and ceasing to use them. Logical\r\ntheory will get along as well as does reflective practice, when it\r\nsticks close by and observes the directions and checks inherent in each\r\nsuccessive phase of the evolution of the cycle of experiencing. The\r\nproblem in general of validity of the thinking process as distinct from\r\nthe validity of this or that process arises only when thinking is\r\nisolated from its historic position and its material context.\r\n\r\n3. But Lotze is not yet done with the problem of validity, even from his\r\nown standpoint. The ground shifts again under his feet. It is no longer\r\na question of the validity of the idea or meaning with which thought is\r\nsupposed to set out; it is no longer a question of the validity of the\r\nprocess of thinking in reference to its own product; it is the question\r\nof the validity of the product. Supposing, after all, that the final\r\nmeaning, or logical idea, is thoroughly coherent and organized;\r\nsupposing it is an object for all consciousness as such. Once more\r\narises the question: What is the validity of even the most coherent and\r\ncomplete idea?--a question which rises and will not down. We may\r\nreconstruct our notion of the chimera until it ceases to be an\r\nindependent idea and becomes a part of the system of Greek mythology.\r\nHas it gained in validity in ceasing to be an independent myth, in\r\nbecoming an element in systematized myth? Myth it was and myth it\r\nremains. Mythology does not get validity by growing bigger. How do we\r\nknow the same is not the case with the ideas which are the product of\r\nour most deliberate and extended scientific inquiry? The reference again\r\nto the content as the self-identical object of all consciousness proves\r\nnothing; the matter of a hallucination does not gain worth in proportion\r\nto its social contagiousness. Or the reference proves that we have not\r\nas yet reached any conclusion, but are entertaining a hypothesis--since\r\nsocial validity is not a matter of mere common content, but of securing\r\nparticipation in a commonly adjudged social experience through action\r\ndirected thereto and directed by consensus of judgment.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lotze, the final product is, after all, still thought. Now,\r\nLotze is committed once for all to the notion that thought, in any form,\r\nis directed by and at an outside reality. The ghost haunts him to the\r\nlast. How, after all, does even the ideally perfect valid thought apply\r\nor refer to reality? Its genuine subject is still beyond itself. At the\r\nlast Lotze can dispose of this question only by regarding it as a\r\nmetaphysical, not a logical, problem (Vol. II, pp. 281, 282). In other\r\nwords, _logically_ speaking, we are at the end just exactly where we\r\nwere at the beginning--in the sphere of ideas, and of ideas only, plus a\r\nconsciousness of the necessity of referring these ideas to a reality\r\nwhich is beyond them, which is utterly inaccessible to them, which is\r\nout of reach of any influence which they may exercise, and which\r\ntranscends any possible comparison with their results. \"It is vain,\"\r\nsays Lotze, \"to shrink from acknowledging the circle here involved ...\r\nall we know of the external world depends upon the ideas of it which are\r\nwithin us\" (Vol. II, p. 185). \"It is then this varied world of ideas\r\nwithin us which forms the sole material directly given to us\" (Vol. II,\r\np. 186). As it is the only material given to us, so it is the only\r\nmaterial with which thought can end. To talk about knowing the external\r\nworld through ideas which are merely within us is to talk of an inherent\r\nself-contradiction. There is no common ground in which the external\r\nworld and our ideas can meet. In other words, the original implication\r\nof a separation between an independent thought-material and an\r\nindependent thought-function and purpose lands us inevitably in the\r\nmetaphysics of subjective idealism, plus a belief in an unknown reality\r\nbeyond, which unknowable is yet taken as the ultimate test of the value\r\nof our ideas as just subjective. The subjectivity of the psychical\r\nevent infects at the last the meaning or ideal object. Because it has\r\nbeen taken to be something \"in itself,\" thought is also something \"in\r\nitself,\" and at the end, after all our maneuvering we are where we\r\nbegan:--with two separate disparates, one of meaning, but no existence,\r\nthe other of existence, but no meaning.\r\n\r\nThe other aspect of Lotze's contradiction which completes the circle is\r\nclear when we refer to his original propositions, and recall that at the\r\noutset he was compelled to regard the origination and conjunctions of\r\nthe impressions, the elements of ideas, as themselves the effects\r\nexercised by a world of things already in existence (see p. 31). He sets\r\nup an independent world of thought, and yet has to confess that both at\r\nits origin and termination it points with absolute necessity to a world\r\nbeyond itself. Only the stubborn refusal to take this initial and\r\nterminal reference of thought beyond itself as having a historic\r\nmeaning, indicating a particular place of generation and a particular\r\npoint of fulfilment in the drama of evolving experience, compels Lotze\r\nto give such bifold objective reference a purely metaphysical turn.\r\n\r\nWhen Lotze goes on to say (Vol. II, p. 191) that the measure of truth of\r\nparticular parts of experience is found in asking whether, when judged\r\nby thought, they are in harmony with other parts of experience; when he\r\ngoes on to say that there is no sense in trying to compare the entire\r\nworld of ideas with a reality which is non-existent, excepting as it\r\nitself should become an idea, Lotze lands where he might better have\r\nfrankly commenced.[43] He saves himself from utter skepticism only by\r\nclaiming that the explicit assumption of skepticism, the need of\r\nagreement of a ready-made idea as such, with an extraneous independent\r\nmaterial as such, is meaningless. He defines correctly the work of\r\nthought as consisting in harmonizing the various portions of experience\r\nwith each other: a definition which has meaning only in connection with\r\nthe fact that experience is continually integrating itself into a\r\nwholeness of coherent meaning deepened in significance by passing\r\nthrough an inner distraction in which by means of conflict certain\r\ncontents are rendered partial and hence objectively conscious. In this\r\ncase the test of thought is the harmony or unity of experience actually\r\neffected. In that sense the test of reality is beyond thought, as\r\nthought, just as at the other limit thought originates out of a\r\nsituation which is not reflectional in character. Interpret this before\r\nand beyond in a historic sense, as an affair of the place occupied and\r\nrôle played by thinking as a function in experience in relation to other\r\nfunctions, and the intermediate and instrumental character of thought,\r\nits dependence upon unreflective antecedents for its existence, and upon\r\na consequent experience for its test of final validity, becomes\r\nsignificant and necessary. Taken at large, it plunges us in the depths\r\nof a hopelessly complicated and self-revolving metaphysic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nA CRITICAL STUDY OF BOSANQUET'S THEORY OF JUDGMENT[44]\r\n\r\n\r\nBosanquet's theory of the judgment, in common with all such theories of\r\nthe judgment, necessarily involves the metaphysical problem of the\r\nnature of reality and of the relation of thought to reality. That the\r\njudgment is the function by which knowledge is attained is a proposition\r\nwhich would meet with universal acceptance. But knowledge is itself a\r\nrelation of some sort between thought and reality. The view which any\r\nlogician adopts as to the nature of the knowledge-process is accordingly\r\nconditioned by his metaphysical presuppositions as to the nature of\r\nreality. It is equally true that the theory of the judgment developed\r\nfrom any metaphysical standpoint serves as a test of the validity of\r\nthat standpoint. We shall attempt in the present paper to show how\r\nBosanquet's theory of the judgment develops from his view of the nature\r\nof reality, and to inquire whether the theory succeeds in giving such an\r\naccount of the knowledge-process as to corroborate the presupposition\r\nunderlying it.\r\n\r\nBosanquet defines judgment as \"the intellectual function which defines\r\nreality by significant ideas and in so doing affirms the reality of\r\nthose ideas\" (p. 104).[45] The form of the definition suggests the\r\nnature of his fundamental problem. There is, on the one hand, a world\r\nof reality which must be regarded as having existence outside of and\r\nindependently of the thoughts or ideas we are now applying to it; and\r\nthere is, on the other hand, a world of ideas whose value is measured by\r\nthe possibility of applying them to reality, of qualifying reality by\r\nthem. The judgment is the function which makes the connection between\r\nthese two worlds. If judgment merely brought one set of ideas into\r\nrelation with another set, then it could never give us anything more\r\nthan purely hypothetical knowledge whose application to the real world\r\nwould remain forever problematic. It would mean that knowledge is\r\nimpossible, a result which seems to be contradicted by the existence of\r\nknowledge. The logician must, therefore, as Bosanquet tells us, regard\r\nit as an essential of the act of judgment that it always refers to a\r\nreality which goes beyond and is independent of the act itself (p. 104).\r\nHis central problem thus becomes that of understanding what the nature\r\nof reality is which permits of being defined by ideas, and what the\r\nnature of an idea is that it can ever be affirmed to be real. How does\r\nthe real world get representation in experience, and what is the\r\nguarantee that the representation, when obtained, is correct?\r\n\r\nThe defining of the problem suggests the view of the nature of reality\r\nout of which Bosanquet's theory of the judgment grows. The real world is\r\nto him a world which has its existence quite independently of the\r\nprocess by which it is known. The real world is there to be known, and\r\nis in no wise modified by the knowledge which we obtain of it. The work\r\nof thought is to build up a world of ideas which shall represent, or\r\ncorrespond to, the world of reality. The more complete and perfect the\r\ncorrespondence, the greater our store of knowledge.\r\n\r\nTranslated into terms of the judgment, this representational view means\r\nthat the subject of the judgment must always be reality, while the\r\npredicate is an idea. But when we examine the content of any universal\r\njudgment, or even of an ordinary judgment of perception, the subject\r\nwhich appears in the judgment is evidently not reality at all, if by\r\nreality we mean something which is in no sense constituted by the\r\nthought-process. When I say, \"The tree is green,\" the subject, tree,\r\ncannot be regarded as a bit of reality which is given ready-made to the\r\nthought-process. The ability to perceive a tree, to distinguish it from\r\nother objects and single it out for the application of an idea,\r\nevidently implies a long series of previous judgments. The content\r\n\"tree\" is itself ideal. As Bosanquet forcibly states it: \"If a sensation\r\nor elementary perception is in consciousness (and if not we have nothing\r\nto do with it in logic), it already bears the form of thinking\" (p. 33).\r\nHow, then, can it serve as the subject of a judgment? Bosanquet's\r\nsolution of the problem is to say that the real subject of a judgment is\r\nnot the grammatical subject which appears in a proposition, but reality\r\nitself. In the more complex forms of judgment the reference to reality\r\nis disguised by the introduction of explicit ideas to designate the\r\nportion of reality to which reference is made (pp. 78, 79). In the\r\nsimplest type of judgment known, however, the qualitative judgment of\r\nperception, the reference to reality appears within the judgment itself.\r\nThe relations of thought to reality and of the elements of the judgment\r\nto one another can, accordingly, most readily be seen in the\r\nconsideration of this rudimentary form of judgment in which the various\r\nparts lie bare before us.\r\n\r\nBosanquet describes it as follows:\r\n\r\n    If I say, pointing to a particular house, \"That is my home,\" it is\r\n    clear that in this act of judgment the reference conveyed by the\r\n    demonstrative is indispensable. The significant idea \"my home\" is\r\n    affirmed, not of any other general significant idea in my mind,\r\n    but of something which is rendered unique by being present to me\r\n    in perception. In making the judgment, \"That is my home,\" I extend\r\n    the present sense-perception of a house in a certain landscape by\r\n    attaching to it the ideal content or meaning of \"home;\" and\r\n    moreover, in doing this, I pronounce the ideal content to be, so\r\n    to speak, of one and the same tissue with what I have before me in\r\n    my actual perception. That is to say, I affirm the meaning of the\r\n    idea, or the idea considered as a meaning, to be a real quality of\r\n    that which I perceive in my perception.\r\n\r\n    The same account holds good of every perceptive judgment; when I\r\n    see a white substance on a plate and judge that \"it is bread\" I\r\n    affirm the reference, or general meaning which constitutes the\r\n    symbolic idea \"bread\" in my mind, to be a real quality of the spot\r\n    or point in present perception which I attempt to designate by the\r\n    demonstrative \"this.\" The act defines the given but indefinite\r\n    real by affirmation of a quality, and affirms reality of the\r\n    definite quality by attaching it to the previously undefined real.\r\n    Reality is given for me _in_ present sensuous perception, and _in_\r\n    the immediate feeling of my own sentient existence that goes with\r\n    it. (Pp. 76, 77.)\r\n\r\nAgain, he says that the general features of the judgment of perception\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n    There is a presence of a something in contact with our sensitive\r\n    self, which, as being so in contact, has the character of reality;\r\n    and there is the qualification of this reality by the reference to\r\n    it of some meaning _such as can_ be symbolized by a name (p. 77).\r\n\r\nOur point of contact with reality, the place where reality gets into the\r\nthought-process, is, according to this view, to be found in the\r\nsimplest, most indefinite type of judgment of perception. We meet with\r\nreality in the mere undefined \"this\" of primitive experience. But each\r\nsuch elementary judgment about an undefined \"this\" is an isolated bit of\r\nexperience. Each \"this\" could give us only a detached bit of reality at\r\nbest, and the further problem now confronts us of how we ever succeed in\r\npiecing our detached bits of reality together to form a real world.\r\nBosanquet's explanation is, in his words, this:\r\n\r\n    The real world, as a definite organized system, is _for me_ an\r\n    extension of this present sensation and self-feeling by means of\r\n    judgment, and it is the essence of judgment to effect and sustain\r\n    such an extension (p. 77).\r\n\r\nAgain he says:\r\n\r\n    The subject in every judgment of Perception is some given spot or\r\n    point in sensuous contact with the percipient self. But, as all\r\n    reality is continuous, the subject is not _merely_ this given spot\r\n    or point. It is impossible to confine the real world within this\r\n    or that presentation. Every definition or qualification of a point\r\n    in present perception is affirmed of the real world which is\r\n    continuous with present perception. The ultimate subject of the\r\n    perceptive judgment is the real world as a whole, and it is of\r\n    this that, in judging, we affirm the qualities or characteristics.\r\n    (P. 78.)\r\n\r\nThe problem is the same as that with which Bradley struggles in his\r\ntreatment of the subject of the judgment, and the solution is also the\r\nsame. Bradley's treatment of the point is perhaps somewhat more\r\nexplicit. Like Bosanquet, he starts with the proposition that the\r\nsubject of the judgment must be reality itself and not an idea, because,\r\nif it were the latter, judgment could never give us anything but a union\r\nof ideas, and a union of ideas remains forever universal and\r\nhypothetical. It can never acquire the uniqueness, the singularity,\r\nwhich is necessary to make it refer to the real. Uniqueness can be found\r\nonly in our contact with the real. But just where does our contact with\r\nthe real occur? Bradley recognizes the fact that it cannot be the\r\n_content_--even in the case of a simple sensation--which gives us\r\nreality. The content of a sensation is a thing which is in my\r\nconsciousness, and which has the form which it presents because it is in\r\nmy consciousness. Reality is precisely something which is not itself\r\nsensation, and cannot be in my consciousness. If I say, \"This is white,\"\r\nthe \"this\" has a content which is a sensation of whiteness. But the\r\nsensation of whiteness is not reality. The experience brings with it an\r\nassurance of reality, not because its content is the real, but because\r\nit is \"my direct encounter in sensible presentation with the real\r\nworld.\"[46] To make the matter clearer, Bradley draws a distinction\r\nbetween the _this_ and the _thisness_. In every experience, however\r\nsimple, there is a content--a \"thisness\"--which is not itself unique.\r\nConsidered merely as content, it is applicable to an indefinite number\r\nof existences; in other words, it is an idea. But there is also in every\r\nexperience a \"this\" which is unique, but which is not a content. It is a\r\nmere sign of existence which gives the experience uniqueness, but\r\nnothing else. The \"thisness\" falls on the side of the content, and the\r\n\"this\" on the side of existence. It is exactly the distinction which\r\nBosanquet has in mind in the passages quoted in which he tells us that\r\n\"reality is given for me _in_ present sensuous perception, and _in_ the\r\nimmediate feeling of my own sentient existence which goes with it;\" and\r\nagain when he says: \"There is a presence of a something in contact with\r\nour sensitive self, which, as being so in contact, has the character of\r\nreality.\" The same point is made somewhat more explicitly in his\r\nintroduction when he says that the individual's present perception is\r\nnot, indeed, reality as such, but is his present point of contact with\r\nreality as such (p. 3).\r\n\r\nBut has this distinction between the content of an experience and its\r\nexistence solved the problem of how we _know_ reality? When Bosanquet\r\ntalks of knowing reality, he means possessing ideas which are an\r\naccurate reproduction of reality. It is still far from clear how,\r\naccording to his own account, we could ever have any assurance that our\r\nideas do represent reality accurately, if we can nowhere find a point\r\nat which the content of an experience can be held to give us reality.\r\nThe case is still worse when we go beyond the problem of how any\r\nparticular bit of reality can be known, and ask ourselves how reality as\r\na whole can be known. The explanation offered by both Bradley and\r\nBosanquet is that by means of judgment we extend the bit of reality of\r\nwhose existence we get a glimpse through a peep-hole in the curtain of\r\nsensuous perception, and thus build up the organized system of reality.\r\nIn a passage previously quoted, Bosanquet tells us that all reality is\r\ncontinuous, and therefore the real subject of a judgment cannot be the\r\nmere spot or point which is given in sensuous perception, but must be\r\nthe real world as a whole. But how does he know that reality is\r\ncontinuous, and that the real world is an organized system? Our only\r\nknowledge of reality comes through judgment, and judgment brings us into\r\ncontact with reality only at isolated points. When he tells us that\r\nreality is a continuous whole, he does so on the basis of a metaphysical\r\npresupposition which is not justifiable by his theory of the judgment.\r\nThe only statement about reality which could be maintained on the basis\r\nof his theory is that some sort of a reality exists, but the theory\r\nfurnishes equal justification for the assurance that this reality is of\r\nsuch a nature that we can never know anything more about it than the\r\nbare fact of its existence. Moreover, the bare fact of the existence of\r\nreality comes to us merely in the form of a feeling of our own sentient\r\nexistence which goes with sense-perception. But the mere assurance that\r\nsomewhere behind the curtain of sensuous perception reality exists (even\r\nif this could go unchallenged), accompanied by the certainty that we can\r\nnever by any possibility know anything more about it, is practically\r\nequivalent to the denial of the possibility of knowledge.[47]\r\n\r\nAlthough the denial of the possibility of knowledge seems to be the\r\nlogical outcome of the premises, it is not the conclusion reached by\r\nBosanquet. At the outset of his treatise, Bosanquet propounds the\r\nfundamental question we have been considering in these words: \"How does\r\nthe analysis of knowledge as a systematic function, or system of\r\nfunctions, explain that relationship in which truth appears to consist,\r\nbetween the human intelligence on the one hand, and fact or reality on\r\nthe other?\" His answer is: \"To this difficulty there is only one reply.\r\nIf the object-matter of reality lay genuinely outside the system of\r\nthought, not only our analysis, but thought itself, would be unable to\r\nlay hold of reality.\" (Pp. 2, 3.) The statement is an explicit\r\nrecognition of the impossibility of bridging the chasm between a reality\r\noutside the content of knowledge and a known real world. It brings\r\nbefore us the dilemma contained in Bosanquet's treatment of the subject\r\nof the judgment. On the one hand the subject of the judgment must be\r\noutside the realm of my thoughts. If it were not, judgment would merely\r\nestablish a relation between my ideas and would give me no knowledge of\r\nthe real world. On the other hand, the subject of the judgment must be\r\nwithin the realm of my thoughts. If it were not, I could never assert\r\nanything of it; could never judge, or know it. The stress he lays on the\r\nfirst horn of the dilemma has been shown. It remains to show his\r\nrecognition of the second horn, and to find out whether or not he\r\ndiscovers any real reconciliation between the two.\r\n\r\nBosanquet sums up the section of the introduction on knowledge and its\r\ncontent, truth, with the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n    The real world for every individual is thus emphatically _his_\r\n    world; an extension and determination of his present perception,\r\n    which perception is to him not indeed reality as such, but his\r\n    point of contact with reality as such. Thus in the enquiry which\r\n    will have to be undertaken as to the logical subject of the\r\n    judgment, we shall find that the subject, however it may shift,\r\n    contract, and expand, is always in the last resort some greater or\r\n    smaller element of this determinate reality, which the individual\r\n    has constructed by identifying significant ideas with that world\r\n    of which he has assurance through his own perceptive experience.\r\n    In analyzing common judgment it is ultimately one to say that _I\r\n    judge_ and that _the real world for me, my real world, extends\r\n    itself_, or maintains its organized extension. This is the\r\n    ultimate connection by which the distinction of subject and\r\n    predication is involved in the act of affirmation or enunciation\r\n    which is the differentia of judgment. (Pp. 3, 4).\r\n\r\nHere the subject of the judgment appears as an element of a reality\r\n_which the individual has constructed_ by identifying significant ideas\r\nwith that world of which he has assurance through his own perceptive\r\nexperience. But the very point with reference to the subject of the\r\njudgment previously emphasized is that it is not and cannot be something\r\nwhich the individual has constructed. The subject of the judgment must\r\nbe reality, and reality does not consist of ideas, even if it be\r\ndetermined by them. It does not mend matters to explain that the\r\nindividual has constructed his real world by identifying significant\r\nideas with that world of which he has assurance through his own\r\nperceptive experiences, because, as we have seen, \"the individual's\r\nperceptive experiences\" either turn out to be merely similar mental\r\nconstructions made at a prior time, so that nothing is gained by\r\nattaching to them, or else they mean once more the mere shock of contact\r\nwhich is supposed to give assurance that some sort of reality exists,\r\nbut which gives no assurance of what it is. That and what, this and\r\nthisness still remain detached. When he talks of _the real world for any\r\nindividual_ we are left entirely in the dark as to what the relation\r\nbetween _the real world as it is for any individual_ and _the real\r\nworld as it is for itself_ may be, or how the individual is to gain any\r\nassurance that _the real world as it is for him_ represents _the real\r\nworld as it is for itself_.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt at a reconciliation of these opposing views leaves us no\r\nbetter satisfied. The passage is as follows:\r\n\r\n    The real world, as a definite organized system, is _for me_ an\r\n    extension of this present sensation and self-feeling by means of\r\n    judgment, and it is the essence of judgment to effect and sustain\r\n    such an extension. It makes no essential difference whether the\r\n    ideas whose content is pronounced to be an attribute of reality\r\n    appear to fall within what is given in perception, or not. We\r\n    shall find hereafter that it is vain to attempt to lay down\r\n    boundaries between the given and its extension. The moment we try\r\n    to do this we are on the wrong track. The given and its extension\r\n    differ not absolutely but relatively; they are continuous with\r\n    each other, and the metaphor by which we speak of an extension\r\n    conceals from us that the so-called \"given\" is no less artificial\r\n    than that by which it is extended. It is the character and quality\r\n    of being directly in contact with sense-perception, not any fixed\r\n    datum of content, that forms the constantly shifting center of the\r\n    individual's real world, and spreads from that center over every\r\n    extension which the system of reality receives from judgment. (P.\r\n    77.)\r\n\r\nIn this passage by the \"given\" he evidently means the content of sensory\r\nexperience, the thisness, the what. It is, as he says, of the same stuff\r\nas that by which it is extended. Both the given and that by which it is\r\nextended are artificial in the sense of not being _real_ according to\r\nBosanquet's interpretation of reality; they are ideas. But if all this\r\nis admitted, what becomes of the possibility of knowledge? Bosanquet\r\nundertakes to rescue it by assuring us again that it is the character\r\nand quality of being directly in contact with sense-perception, not any\r\nfixed datum of content, that forms the center of the individual's real\r\nworld and gives the stamp of reality to his otherwise ideal extension of\r\nthis center. Here again we find ourselves with no evidence that the\r\n_content_ of our knowledge bears any relation to reality. We have merely\r\nthe feeling of vividness attached to sensory experience which seems to\r\nbring us the certainty that there is some sort of a reality behind it,\r\nbut this is not to give assurance that our ideal content even belongs\r\nrightfully to that against which we have bumped, much less of _how_ it\r\nbelongs--and only this deserves the title \"knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on \"Quality and Comparison,\" in which he takes up the\r\nmore detailed treatment of the simplest types of judgment of perception,\r\nhe comes back to the same contradiction, and again attempts to explain\r\nhow both horns of his dilemma must be true. The passage is this:\r\n\r\n    The Reality to which we ascribe the predicate is undoubtedly\r\n    self-existent; it is not _merely_ in my mind or in my act of\r\n    judgment; if it were, the judgment would only be a game with my\r\n    ideas. It is well to make this clear in the case before us, for in\r\n    the later forms of the judgment it will be much disguised. Still\r\n    the reality which attracts my concentrated attention is also\r\n    within my act of judgment; it is not even the whole reality\r\n    present to my perception; still less of course the whole\r\n    self-existent Reality which I dimly presuppose. The immediate\r\n    subject of the judgment is a mere aspect, too indefinite to be\r\n    described by explicit ideas except in as far as the qualitative\r\n    predication imposes a first specification upon it. _This_ Reality\r\n    _is_ in my judgment; it is the point at which the actual world\r\n    impinges upon my consciousness as real, and it is only by judging\r\n    with reference to this point that I can refer the ideal content\r\n    before my mind to the whole of reality which I at once believe to\r\n    exist, and am attempting to construct. The Subject is both in and\r\n    out of the Judgment, as Reality is both in and out of my\r\n    consciousness. (Pp. 113, 114.)\r\n\r\nThe conclusion he reaches is a mere restatement of the difficulty. The\r\nproblem he is trying to solve is how the subject _can_ be both in and\r\nout of the judgment, and how the subject without is related to the\r\nsubject within. The mere assertion that it is so does not help us to\r\nunderstand it. His procedure seems like taking advantage of two\r\nmeanings of sense-perception, its conscious quality and its brute abrupt\r\nimmediacy, and then utilizing this ambiguity to solve a problem which\r\ngrows out of the conception of judgment as a reference of idea to\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nTurning from his treatment of the world of fact to his discussion of the\r\nworld of idea, from the subject to the predicate, as it appears in his\r\ntheory of the judgment we find again a paradox which must be recognized\r\nand cannot be obviated. An idea is essentially a meaning. It is not a\r\nparticular existence whose essence is uniqueness as is the case with the\r\nsubject of the judgment, but is a meaning whose importance is that it\r\nmay apply to an indefinite number of unique existences. Its\r\ncharacteristic is universality. And yet an idea regarded as a psychical\r\nexistence, an idea as a content in my mind, is just as particular and\r\nunique as any other existence. How, then, does it obtain its\r\ncharacteristic of universality? Bosanquet's answer is that it must be\r\nuniversal by means of a reference to something other than itself. Its\r\nmeaning resides, not in its existence as a psychical image, but in its\r\nreference to something beyond itself. Now, any idea that is affirmed is\r\nreferred to reality, but do ideas exist which are not being affirmed? If\r\nso, their reference cannot be to reality. Bosanquet discusses the\r\nquestion in the second section of his introduction as follows:\r\n\r\n    It is not easy to deny that there is a world of ideas or of\r\n    meanings, which simply consists in that identical reference of\r\n    symbols by which mutual understanding between rational beings is\r\n    made possible. A _mere_ suggestion, a _mere_ question, a _mere_\r\n    negation, seem all of them to imply that we sometimes _entertain_\r\n    ideas without affirming them of reality, and therefore without\r\n    affirming their reference to be a reference to something real or\r\n    their meaning to be fact. We may be puzzled indeed to say what an\r\n    idea can mean, or to what it can refer, if it does not mean or\r\n    refer to something real--to some element in the fabric\r\n    continuously sustained by the judgment which is our consciousness.\r\n    On the other hand, it would be shirking a difficulty to neglect\r\n    the consideration that an idea, while denied of reality, may\r\n    nevertheless, or even must, possess an identical and so\r\n    intelligible reference--a symbolic value--for the rational beings\r\n    who deny it. A reference, it may be argued, must be a reference to\r\n    something. But it seems as if in this case the something were the\r\n    fact of reference itself, the rational convention between\r\n    intelligent beings, or rather the world which has existence,\r\n    whether for one rational being or for many, merely as contained in\r\n    and sustained by such intellectual reference.\r\n\r\n    I only adduce these considerations in order to explain that\r\n    transitional conception of an objective world or world of\r\n    meanings, distinct from the real world or world of facts, with\r\n    which it is impossible wholly to dispense in an account of thought\r\n    starting from the individual subject. The paradox is that the real\r\n    world or world of fact thus seems for us to fall within and be\r\n    included in the objective world or world of meanings, as if all\r\n    that is fact were meaning, but not every meaning were fact. This\r\n    results in the contradiction that something is objective, which is\r\n    not real. (Pp. 4, 5.)\r\n\r\nIn the seventh section of the introduction Bosanquet explains his\r\nmeaning further by what the reader is privileged to regard as a flight\r\nof the imagination--a mere simile--which he thinks may, nevertheless,\r\nmake the matter clearer.\r\n\r\n    We might try to think that the world, _as known to each of us_, is\r\n    constructed and sustained by his individual consciousness; and\r\n    that every other individual also frames for himself, and sustains\r\n    by the action of his intelligence, the world in which he in\r\n    particular lives and moves. Of course such a construction is to be\r\n    taken as a reconstruction, a construction by way of knowledge\r\n    only; but for our present purpose this is indifferent. Thus we\r\n    might think of the ideas and objects of our private world rather\r\n    as corresponding to than as from the beginning identical with\r\n    those which our fellow-men are occupied in constructing each\r\n    within his own sphere of consciousness. And the same would be true\r\n    even of the objects and contents within our own world, in as far\r\n    as an act or effort would be required to maintain them, of the\r\n    same kind with that which was originally required to construct\r\n    them.... Thus the paradox of reference would become clearer. We\r\n    should understand that we refer to a correspondence by means of a\r\n    content. We should soften down the contradiction of saying that a\r\n    name to meet which we have and can get nothing but an idea,\r\n    nevertheless does not stand for that idea but for something else.\r\n    We should be able to say that the name stands for those elements\r\n    in the idea which correspond in all our separate worlds, and in\r\n    our own world of yesterday and of today, considered as so\r\n    corresponding. (Pp. 45, 46.)\r\n\r\nAccording to this view, the idea obtains the universality which\r\nconstitutes it an idea by a sort of process of elimination. It is like a\r\ncomposite photograph. It selects only the common elements in a large\r\nnumber of particular existences, and thus succeeds in representing, or\r\nreferring to, all the particular existences which have gone to make it\r\nup. But when we come to consider the bearing which this view of\r\nuniversality, or generalized significance, has on our estimate of the\r\nknowledge-process, we feel that it has not solved the problem for us. In\r\nthe first place, the idea _in its existence_ is just as particular when\r\nregarded as made up of the common elements of many ideas as is any of\r\nthe ideas whose elements are taken. A composite photograph is just as\r\nmuch a single photograph as any one of the photographs which are taken\r\nto compose it. The chasm between the particularity of the psychical\r\nimage and the universality of its meaning is not bridged by regarding\r\nthe content of the image as made up by eliminating unlike elements in a\r\nnumber of images. The stuff with which thought has to work is still\r\nnothing more than a particular psychical image, and the problem of what\r\ngives it its logical value as a general significance is still unsolved.\r\nNor does it seem possible to find anything in the _existence_ of the\r\nimage which could account for its reference to something outside of\r\nitself. The _fact_ of reference itself becomes an ultimate mystery.[48]\r\n\r\nBut even waiving this difficulty, the judgment must still\r\nappear truncated, if it really totally disregard a part of its\r\ncontent--_i. e._, the particular existence of the image as part of the\r\njudging consciousness. The theory holds that the particular existence of\r\nthe image has no logical value. It is only its meaning, or general\r\nreference, which has logical value. But the image _qua_ image is just as\r\nreal as that to which it is supposed to refer. If the judgment really\r\ndoes ignore its existence, then it ignores a portion of the reality it\r\nattempts to represent, and stands self-confessed as a failure.[49] At\r\nstill another point, ideas, as Bosanquet represents them, prove to be\r\nunsatisfactory tools to use in the work of building up reality. In\r\nBosanquet's words: \"The meaning tyrannizes over the psychical image in\r\nanother respect. Besides crushing out of sight its particular and\r\nexclusive existence, it also crushes out part of its content\" (p. 74).\r\nThe idea, as we use it, is not, as to content, a complete or accurate\r\nrepresentation of anything real. To take Bosanquet's illustration:\r\n\r\n    Some one speaks to me of the Ægean sea, which I have never seen.\r\n    He tells me that it is a deep blue sea under a cloudless sky,\r\n    studded with rocky islands. The meanings of these words are a\r\n    problem set to my thought. I have to meet him in the world of\r\n    objective references, which as intelligent beings we have in\r\n    common. How I do this is my own affair, and the precise images at\r\n    my command will vary from day to day, and from minute to minute.\r\n    It sounds simple to say that I combine my recollections of sea and\r\n    sky at Torbay with those of the island-studded waters of Orkney\r\n    or the Hebrides. Even so, there is much to adjust and to neglect;\r\n    the red cliffs of Torbay, and the cloudy skies of the north. But\r\n    then again, my recollections are already themselves symbolic\r\n    ideas; the reference to Torbay or the Hebrides is itself a problem\r\n    set to thought, and puts me upon the selection of index-elements\r\n    in fugitive images that are never twice the same. I have _first_\r\n    to symbolize the color of Torbay, using for the purpose any blue\r\n    that I can call to mind, and fixing, correcting, subtracting from,\r\n    the color so recalled, till I reduce it to a mere index quality;\r\n    and _then_ I have to deal in the same way with the meaning or\r\n    significant idea so obtained, clipping and adjusting the qualities\r\n    of Torbay till it seems to serve as a symbol of the Ægean. (Pp.\r\n    74, 75.)\r\n\r\nAnd by the time all this is performed what sort of a representation of\r\nreality is the idea? Evidently a very poor and meager and fragmentary\r\none.\r\n\r\nIt is so poor and fragmentary, that it cannot itself be that which is\r\naffirmed of reality. It must be some other fuller existence to be found\r\nin the world of meanings which is affirmed. And yet how the meager\r\ncontent of the idea succeeds in referring to the world of meanings, and\r\nacting as the instrument for referring a meaning to reality, is not at\r\nall clear. It seems impossible to explain reference intelligibly by the\r\nconcept of a _correspondence_ of contents.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difficulty in the interpretation of the predicate is the\r\nsame one that we encountered in the interpretation of the subject. If\r\nthe predicate is to be affirmed of reality (and if it be not, it has no\r\nlogical value), then it must, when affirmed, be in some sense an\r\naccurate representation of reality. But the predicate is an idea, and,\r\nmoreover, an idea which is, both in its existence and in its meaning\r\npalpably the outcome of transformations wrought upon given sensory\r\ncontents by the individual consciousness. Since the one point of contact\r\nwith reality is in sensory experience, the more simple sensory\r\nexperiences are reacted upon and worked over, the farther they recede\r\nfrom reality. The idea seems, therefore, in its very essence, a thing\r\nwhich never can be affirmed of reality. As image it is itself a reality,\r\nbut not affirmed; as meaning it is that reality (the image) manipulated\r\nfor individual ends. Why suppose that by distorting reality we get it in\r\nshape to affirm _of_ reality? Moreover, the farther an idea is removed\r\nfrom immediate sensory experience--in other words, the more abstract it\r\nbecomes--the less is the possibility of affirming it of reality. The\r\nfinal outcome of this point of view, if we adhere rigorously to its\r\nlogic is that the more thinking we do, the less we know about the real\r\nworld. Bosanquet avoids this conclusion by a pure act of faith. If\r\nknowledge is to be rescued, we must believe that the work done by\r\nconsciousness upon the bits of reality given in sensory experience\r\nreally does succeed in building up a knowledge of reality for us. As\r\nBosanquet puts it: \"The presentation of Reality, qualified by an ideal\r\ncontent, is one aspect of Subject and Predication; and my individual\r\npercipient consciousness determining itself by a symbolic idea is the\r\nother. That the latter is identified with the former follows from the\r\nclaim of conscious thought that its nature is to know.\"[50] (P. 83.)\r\n\r\nTo sum up the situation, Bosanquet starts out with the assumption that\r\nby knowledge we must mean knowledge of a world entirely independent of\r\nour ideas. If we fail to make this assumption, knowledge becomes merely\r\na relation between ideas. But its whole importance seems to us to rest\r\non the conviction that it does give us knowledge of a world which is\r\nwhat it is quite independently of our ideas about it, and cannot in any\r\nsense be modified by what we think about it. What knowledge does is to\r\ngive us a copy or representation of the real world, whose value depends\r\non the accuracy of the representation. And yet when we examine any\r\nindividual knowing consciousness, the subject which appears within the\r\njudgment is never some portion of the world which exists outside of the\r\nknowing consciousness, but always some portion of the world which exists\r\nwithin the knowing consciousness, and which is constituted by the\r\nknowledge process. The predicate which is affirmed of reality is\r\nconstantly found to derive its meaning, its generalized significance,\r\nnot from its correspondence with, or reference to, the real world\r\noutside of the knowing consciousness, but from reference to a world of\r\nmeanings, which consists in a sort of convention among rational\r\nbeings--a world whose existence is distinctly within the knowing\r\nconsciousness and not outside of it.[51] Between the real world, as\r\nBosanquet conceives it, and the world of knowledge, we find inserted on\r\nthe side of the subject, the world _as known to each of us_, and on the\r\nside of the predicate, the _objective world of meanings_. Neither of\r\nthese is the real world. Both of them are ideal, _i. e._, are\r\nconstructions of the individual consciousness. We nowhere find any\r\nsatisfactory explanation of how these ideal worlds are related to the\r\nreal world. There is merely the assertion that we must believe that they\r\nrepresent the real world in order that we may believe that knowledge\r\nexists. But the fact remains that whenever we try to analyze and explain\r\nany particular judgment, what we find ourselves dealing with is always\r\nthe world as it exists to us as subject, and the objective world of\r\nmeanings as predicate. If we stop here, then knowledge turns out to be\r\njust what Bosanquet asserted at the outset that it was _not, i. e._, a\r\nrelation between ideas. When we demand a justification for going farther\r\nthan this, we find none except the claim of conscious thought that its\r\nnature is to know--a claim whose justice we have no possible means of\r\ntesting, and which would not, even if admitted, be of the slightest\r\nvalue in deciding which _particular_ judgment is true and which false.\r\n\r\nBosanquet's development of his subject has proved to be throughout the\r\nnecessary logical outcome of the presuppositions with reference to\r\nreality from which he starts. The fundamental difficulty of erecting a\r\ntheory of the knowledge-process upon such a basis is recognized by him\r\nat the start in a passage already quoted: \"If the object-matter of\r\nreality lay genuinely outside the system of thought, not only our\r\nanalysis, but thought itself, would be unable to lay hold of reality\"\r\n(p. 2). But, in spite of this assertion, his fundamental conception of\r\nreality remains that of a system which does lie outside the\r\nthought-process. His theory is an attempt to reconcile the essentially\r\nirreconcilable views that reality is outside of the thought-process, and\r\nthat it is inside of the thought-process, and he succeeds only by\r\ncalling upon our faith that so it is.\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as it seems to him to be, that we are compelled to adhere\r\nto both of these views of reality, then surely there is no other\r\noutcome. It means, however, that we finally resign all hope of _knowing_\r\nreality. We may _have faith_ in its existence, but we have no way of\r\ndeciding what particular judgment has reality in it as it should have\r\nit, and what as it should not. All stand (and fall) on the same basis.\r\nBut does not Bosanquet himself point out a pathway which, if followed\r\nfarther, would reach a more satisfactory view of the realm of knowledge?\r\nHe has shown us that the only sort of reality _we know_, or can know, is\r\nthe reality which appears within our judgment-process--the reality as\r\nknown to us. Would it not be possible to drop the presupposed reality\r\noutside of the judgment-process (with which judgment is endeavoring to\r\nmake connections) and content ourselves with the sort of reality which\r\nappears within the judgment-process? In other words, may there not be a\r\nsatisfactory view of reality which frankly recognizes its organic\r\nrelation to the knowledge-process, without at the same time destroying\r\nits value as reality? Is it possible to admit that reality is in a sense\r\nconstituted in the judgment without making it at the same time the\r\nfigment of the individual imagination--\"a game with ideas\"?\r\n\r\nLet us assume for the moment that the real difficulty with Mr.\r\nBosanquet's conception, the error that keeps him traveling in his\r\nhopeless circles, is the notion that truth is a matter of reference of\r\nideas as such to reality as such, leading us to oscillate between the\r\nalternatives that either all ideas have such reference, and so are true,\r\nconstitute knowledge; or else none have such reference, and so are\r\nfalse; or else are mere ideas to which neither truth nor falsity can be\r\nattributed. Let us ask if truth is not rather some _specific_ relation\r\nwithin experience, something which characterizes one idea rather than\r\nanother, so that our problem is not how an idea can refer to a reality\r\nbeyond itself, but what are the marks by which we discriminate a true\r\nreference from a false one. Then let us ask for the criterion used in\r\ndaily life and in science by which to test reality.\r\n\r\nIf we ask the philosophically unsophisticated individual why he believes\r\nthat his house still exists when he is away from it and has no immediate\r\nevidence of the fact, he will tell you it is because he has found that\r\nhe can go back to it time and again and see it and walk into it. It\r\nnever fails him when he acts upon the assumption that it is there. He\r\nwould never tell you that he believed in its existence when he was not\r\nexperiencing it because his mental picture of his house stood for and\r\nrepresented accurately an object in the real world which was\r\nnevertheless of a different order of existence from his mental picture.\r\nWhen you ask the physicist why he believes that the laws of motion are\r\ntrue, he will tell you that it is because he finds that bodies always\r\ndo behave according to them. He can predict just what a body will do\r\nunder given circumstances. He is never disappointed however long he\r\ntakes it for granted that the laws of motion are true and that bodies\r\nbehave according to them. The only thing that could make him question\r\ntheir truth would be to find some body which did not prove to behave in\r\naccordance with them. The criterion is the same in both cases. It is the\r\npractical criterion of what as a matter of fact will work. That which\r\ncan safely be taken for granted as a basis for further action is\r\nregarded as real and true. It remains real so long, and only so long, as\r\nit continues to fulfil this condition. As soon as it ceases to do so, it\r\nceases to be regarded as real. When a man finds that he can no longer\r\nobtain the accustomed experience of seeing and entering his house, he\r\nceases to regard it as real. It has burned down, or been pulled down.\r\nWhen a physicist finds that a body does not, as a matter of fact, behave\r\nas a given law leads him to expect it would behave, he ceases to regard\r\nthe law as _true_.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the naïve view of the criterion of reality and the\r\none we have just been discussing may be brought out by considering how\r\nwe should have to interpret from each standpoint the constant succession\r\nof facts in the history of science which have ceased to be facts. For\r\nillustration take the former fact that the earth is flat. It ceased to\r\nbe a fact, says the theory we have been reviewing, because further\r\nthought-constructions of the real world convinced us that there is no\r\nreality which the idea \"flat-world\" represents. The idea \"round-world\"\r\nalone reproduces reality. It ceased to be a fact, says the naïve view,\r\nbecause it ceased to be a safe guide for action. Men found they could\r\nsail around the world. Correspondence in one case is pictorial, and its\r\nexistence or non-existence can, as we have seen, never be ascertained.\r\nIn the other, correspondence is response, adjustment, the co-meeting of\r\nspecific conditions in further constituting of experience.\r\n\r\nIn actual life, therefore, the criterion of reality which we use is a\r\npractical one. The test of reality does not consist in ascertaining the\r\nrelationship between an idea and an _x_ which is not idea, but in\r\nascertaining what experience can be taken for granted as a safe basis\r\nfor securing other experiences. The evident advantage of the latter\r\nview, leaving aside for the moment the question of its adequacy in other\r\nrespects, is that it avoids the fundamental skepticism at once suggested\r\nby the former. How can we ever be sure that the fact which we have\r\ndiscovered will stand the test of further thought-constructions? Perhaps\r\nit comes no nearer to reality than the discarded one. Obviously we never\r\n_can_ be sure that any particular content of thought represents reality\r\nso accurately and perfectly that it will never be subject to revision.\r\nIf, however, the test of reality is the _adequacy_ of a given content of\r\nconsciousness as a stimulus to action, as a mode of control, we have an\r\napplicable standard. A given content of consciousness is real--is a\r\nfact--so long as the act resulting from it is adequate in adaptation to\r\nother contents. It ceases to be real as soon as the act it stimulates\r\nproves to be inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe view which places the ultimate test of facts, not in any\r\nrelationship of contents or existences, but in the practical outcome of\r\nthought, is the one which seems to follow necessarily from a\r\nthoroughgoing conception of the judgment as a function--an act. Our\r\nfundamental biological conception of the activities of living organisms\r\nis that acts exist for the sake of their results. Acts are always\r\nstimulated by some definite set of conditions, and their value is always\r\ntested by the adequacy with which they meet this set of conditions. The\r\njudgment is no exception to the rule. It is always an act stimulated by\r\nsome set of conditions which needs readjusting. Its outcome is a\r\nreadjustment whose value is and can be tested only by its adequacy. It\r\nis accordingly entirely in line with our reigning biological conceptions\r\nto expect to find the ultimate criterion of truth and reality in the\r\npractical outcome of thought, and to seek for an understanding of the\r\nnature of the \"real\" and of the \"ideal\" within the total activity of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty besets us at the outset of such an investigation--that of\r\nbeing sure that we have a genuine judgment under examination. A large\r\nportion of the so-called judgments considered by logicians, even by\r\nthose who emphasize the truth that a judgment is an _act_, are really\r\nnot judgments at all, but contents of thought which are the outcome of\r\njudgments--what might be called dead judgments, instead of live\r\njudgments. When we analyze a real act of judgment, as it occurs in a\r\nliving process of thought, we find given elements which are always\r\npresent. There is always a certain situation which demands a reaction.\r\nThe situation is always in part determined and taken for granted, and in\r\npart questioned. It is determined in so far as it is a definite\r\nsituation of some sort; it is undetermined in so far as it furnishes an\r\ninadequate basis for further action and therefore comes to consciousness\r\nas a problem. For example, take one of the judgments Bosanquet uses.\r\n\"This is bread.\" We have first to inquire when such a judgment actually\r\noccurs in the living process of thought. A man does not make such a\r\njudgment in the course of his thinking unless there is some instigation\r\nto do so. Perhaps he is in doubt as to whether the white object he\r\nperceives is bread or cake. He wants some bread, but does not want cake.\r\nA closer inspection convinces him that it is bread, and the finished\r\njudgment is formulated in the proposition: \"This is bread.\" What is the\r\ntest of the reality of the bread, and the truth of the judgment?\r\nEvidently the act based on it. He eats the bread. If it tastes like\r\nbread and affects him like bread, then the bread was real and the\r\njudgment true. If, on the other hand, it does not taste like bread, or\r\nif it makes him violently ill, then the \"bread\" was not real and the\r\njudgment was false. In either case, the \"this\"--the experience to be\r\ninterpreted--is unquestioned. The man does not question the fact that he\r\nhas a perception of a white object. So much is taken for granted and is\r\nunquestioned within that judgment. But there is another part of the\r\nexperience which is questioned, and which remains tentative up to the\r\nconclusion of the act of judgment; that is the doubt as to whether the\r\nperceived white object is bread or something else. Every live judgment,\r\nevery judgment as it normally occurs in the vital process of thought,\r\nmust have these phases. It is only when a judgment is taken out of its\r\ncontext and reduced to a mere memorandum of past judgments that it fails\r\nto reveal such parts. The man may, of course, go farther back. He may\r\nwonder whether this is really white or not. But he falls back then on\r\nsomething else which he takes unquestioningly--a \"this\" experience of\r\nsome sort or other.\r\n\r\nSo far we have considered the practical criterion of reality merely as\r\nthe one which is actually operative in everyday life, and as the one\r\nsuggested by our biological theory of the functions of living organisms.\r\nIt also offers a suggestion for the modified view of the nature of\r\nreality for which we are in search. Our previous discussion brought out\r\nincidentally a contradiction in the traditional theory of the nature of\r\nreality which it will be worth while to consider further. In dealing\r\nwith the subject of the judgment, reality seemed to be made synonymous\r\nwith fact. In this sense fact, or the real, was set off against the\r\nideal. Knowledge was viewed as the correspondence between real and\r\nideal. When we came to deal with the ideal itself--with the predicate\r\nof the judgment--there appeared in it an element of fact or reality\r\nwhich proved a serious stumbling-block for the theory. As image in my\r\nmind, the idea is just as real as the so-called facts; but this sort of\r\nreality according to the theory in question is neither the reality about\r\nwhich we are judging nor a real quality of it. Both Bradley and\r\nBosanquet are forced to admit that the judgment ignores it, and is in so\r\nfar by nature inadequate to its appointed task of knowing reality.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion which the situation offers for a new theory is that the\r\nview of reality has been too narrow. Reality must evidently be a broad\r\nenough term to cover both fact and idea. If so, the reality must be\r\nnothing more nor less than the total process of experience with its\r\ncontinual opposition of fact and idea, and their continual resolution\r\nthrough activity. That which previous theory has been calling the real\r\nis not the total reality, but merely one aspect of it. The problem of\r\nrelation of fact and idea is thus the problem of the relation of one\r\nform of reality to another, and so a determinate soluble one, not a\r\n_merely_ metaphysical or general one. Granting this, does it still\r\nremain true that reality in the narrower sense, reality as fact, can be\r\nregarded as a different order of existence from the ideal, and set over\r\nagainst the thought-process? Evidently not. Fact and idea become merely\r\ntwo aspects of a total reality. The way in which fact and idea are\r\ndistinguished has already been suggested by the practical and biological\r\ncriterion of fact, or reality in the narrower sense. From this point of\r\nview, fact is not a different order of existence from idea, but is\r\nmerely a part of the total process of experience which functions in a\r\ngiven way. It is merely that part of experience which is taken as given,\r\nand which serves as a stimulus to action. Thus the essential nature of\r\nfact, or reality in the popular sense, falls not at all on the side of\r\nits content, but on the side of its function. Similarly the ideal is\r\nmerely that part of the total experience which is taken as tentative.\r\nThere is no problem as to how either of them is related to reality. In\r\nthis relationship they _are_ reality. That which previous theories had\r\nbeen calling the whole of reality now appears as merely one aspect of\r\nit--the fact aspect--artificially isolated from the rest.\r\n\r\nWhen we translate this view of the nature of reality into terms of a\r\ntheory of the judgment, we find that we can agree with Bosanquet in his\r\ndefinition of a judgment. It is an act, and an act which refers an ideal\r\ncontent to reality. The judgment must be an act, because it is\r\nessentially an adaptation--a reaction toward a given situation. The\r\nsubject of the judgment is that part of the content of experience which\r\nrepresents the situation to be reacted to. It is that which is taken for\r\ngranted as given in each case. Now this is, as we have seen, reality--in\r\nthe narrower sense of that term. What Bosanquet has been calling reality\r\nnow appears merely as the subject of the judgment taken out of its\r\nnormal function and considered as an isolated thing. It is an artificial\r\nabstraction. It is accordingly true, as Bosanquet insists, that the\r\nsubject of the judgment must always be reality--both in his sense of the\r\nterm and in ours. This reality is not real, however, by virtue of its\r\nindependence from the judgment, but by virtue of its function within the\r\njudgment. His fundamental problem with reference to the subject of the\r\njudgment is disposed of from this point of view. The subject is wholly\r\nwithin the judgment, not in any sense outside of it; but it is at the\r\nsame time true that the subject of the judgment is reality. The fact\r\nthat the subjects of all judgments--even those of the most elementary\r\ntype--bear evident marks of the work done by thought upon them, ceases\r\nto be a problem. The subject is essentially a thing constituted by the\r\ndoubt-inquiry process, and functioning within it. The necessity for an\r\nintermediate _real world as it is to me_ between the real world and the\r\nknowing process disappears, because the _real world as it is to me_ is\r\nthe only real world of which the judgment can take account. There is no\r\nlonger any divorce between the content of the subject and its existence.\r\nReality in his sense of the term--reality as fact--does not fall on the\r\nside of _existence_ in distinction from content, but on the side of\r\n_function_ in distinction from content.\r\n\r\nThe predicate of the judgment is that part of the total experience which\r\nis taken as doubtful, or tentative. As we have seen, every act of\r\nadaptation involves a definite situation to be reacted to (subject) and\r\nan indefinite or tentative material with which to react (predicate). We\r\nhave pointed out that a situation which demands a judgment never appears\r\nin consciousness as mere questioned or questionable situation.[52] There\r\nis always present, as soon as the doubt arises, some sort of tentative\r\nsolution. This is the predicate or idea. Just as the fact, or real in\r\nthe narrower sense, is that which is taken as given in the situation, so\r\nthe ideal is that which is taken as tentative. Its ideality does not\r\nconsist in its reference to another order of existence, the objective\r\nworld of meanings, but in its function within the judgment, the estimate\r\nof the whole situation as leading up to the adequate act. Just as we no\r\nlonger have any need for the mediation of the _real world as known to\r\nme_ between subject and reality, so we no longer need _the objective\r\nworld of meanings_ to bridge the chasm between the predicate and\r\nreality. The difficulty of understanding how ideas can be used to build\r\nup facts disappears when we regard fact and idea, not as different\r\norders of existence, but as contents marking different phases of a total\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nIdeas, as Bosanquet represented them, proved to be extremely\r\nunsatisfactory tools to use in building up a knowledge of reality. In\r\nthe first place, their value as instruments of thought depends upon\r\ntheir universality. We have already reviewed Bosanquet's difficulties in\r\nattempting to explain the universality of ideas. The universality of an\r\nidea cannot reside in its mere existence as image. Its existence is\r\npurely particular. Its universality must reside in its reference to\r\nsomething outside of itself. But no explanation of how the particular\r\nexistence--image--could refer to another and fuller content of a\r\ndifferent order of existence could be discovered. The fact of reference\r\nremained an ultimate mystery. From the new point of view the image gains\r\nits universality through its organizing function. It represents an\r\norganized habit which may be brought to bear upon the present situation,\r\nand which serves, by directing action, to organize and unify experience\r\nas a whole. It is only as function that the concept of reference can be\r\nmade intelligible.\r\n\r\nOf course, considered as content, the idea is just as particular from\r\nthis point of view as from any other. We still have to discuss the\r\nquestion as to whether or not the particularity of the idea has a\r\nlogical value. The fact that it had none in Bosanquet's theory sets a\r\nlimit to the validity of thought. But if the real test of the validity\r\nof a judgment is the act in which it issues, then the existential aspect\r\nof the idea must have logical value. The existential aspect of the idea\r\nis the \"my\" side of it. It is as my personal experience that it exists.\r\nBut it is only as my idea that it has any impulsive power, or can issue\r\nin action. Far from being ignored, therefore, the existential aspect is\r\nessential to the logical, the determinative, value of an idea.\r\n\r\nIdeas, according to the representational theory of knowledge, proved to\r\nbe a poor medium for knowing reality in still another respect. They are\r\nin their very nature contents that have been reduced from the fulness\r\nof experience to mere index-signs. Even though their reference to a\r\nfuller content in the objective world of meanings presented no problem,\r\nstill this objective world of meanings is far removed from reality. And\r\nyet, in order to know, we must be able to affirm ideas of reality. On\r\nthe functional theory of ideas, their value does not rest at all upon\r\ntheir representational nature. They are not taken either in their\r\nexistence or in their meaning as representations of any other content.\r\nThey are taken as contents which mark a given function, and their value\r\nis determined entirely by the adequacy of the function of which they are\r\nthe conscious expression. Their content may be as meager as you please.\r\nIt may have been obtained by a long process of reducing and transforming\r\nsensory experience, but if it serve to enable its possessor to meet the\r\nsituation which called it up with the appropriate act, then it has truth\r\nand value in the fullest sense. The reduction of the idea to a mere\r\nindex-sign presents no problem when we realize that it is the tool of a\r\ngiven function, not the sign for a different and fuller content. The\r\nidea thus becomes a commendable economy in the thought-process, rather\r\nthan a reprehensible departure from reality.\r\n\r\nWe have already upon general considerations criticised the point of view\r\nwhich holds that ideality consists in reference to another content. In\r\narguing that this reference cannot be primarily to reality itself, but\r\nrather to an intermediate world of meanings, Bosanquet cites the\r\nquestion and the negative judgment. In the question ideas are not\r\naffirmed of reality, and in negation they are definitely denied of\r\nreality, hence their reference cannot be to reality. It must therefore\r\nbe to an objective world of meanings. It may be worth while to point out\r\nin passing that, from the functional point of view, the part played by\r\nideas in the question and in negative judgment is the same that it is in\r\naffirmation.\r\n\r\nWe have brought out the fact that all judgment arises in a doubt. The\r\nearliest stage of judgment is accordingly a question. Whether the\r\nprocess stops at that point, or is carried on to an affirmation or\r\nnegation, depends upon the particular conditions. The ideas which appear\r\nin questions present no other problem than those of affirmation. They\r\nare ideas, not by virtue of their reference to another content in the\r\nworld of meanings, but by virtue of their function, _i. e._, that of\r\nconstituting that part of the total experience which is taken as\r\ndoubtful, and hence as in process.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this point clear with reference to negative judgments,\r\nit will be necessary to consider the relation of negative and positive\r\njudgments somewhat more in detail. All judgment is in its earliest\r\nstages a question, but a question is never _mere_ question. There are\r\nalways present some suggestions of an answer, which make the process\r\nreally a disjunctive judgment. A question might be defined as a\r\ndisjunctive judgment in which one member of the disjunction is expressed\r\nand the others implied. If the process goes on to take the form of\r\naffirmation or negation, one of the suggested answers is selected. To\r\nfollow out the illustration of the bread used above, the judgment arises\r\nin a doubt as to the nature of the white object perceived, but the doubt\r\nnever takes the form of a blank question. It at once suggests certain\r\npossible solutions drawn from the mass of organized experience at the\r\ncommand of the person judging. At this stage the judgment is\r\ndisjunctive. In the illustration it would probably take the form: \"This\r\nis either bread or cake.\" The further course of the judgment rejects the\r\ncake alternative, and selects the bread, and the final outcome of the\r\njudgment is formulated in the proposition: \"This is bread.\" But how did\r\nit happen that it did not take the form: \"This is not cake\"? That\r\nproposition is also involved in the outcome, and implied in the judgment\r\nmade. The answer is that the form taken by the final outcome depends\r\nentirely on the direction of interest of the person making the judgment.\r\nIf his interest happened to lie in obtaining bread, then the outcome\r\nwould naturally take the form: \"This is bread,\" and his act would\r\nconsist in eating it. If he happened to want cake, the natural form\r\nwould be, \"This is not cake,\" and his act would consist in refraining\r\nfrom eating. In other words, the question as to whether a judgment turns\r\nout to be negative or positive is a question of whether the stress of\r\ninterest happens to fall on the selected or on the rejected portions of\r\nthe original disjunction. Every determination of a subject through a\r\npredicate includes both. The selection of one or the other according to\r\ninterest affects the final formulation of the process, but does not\r\nchange the relations of its various phases. An idea in a negative\r\njudgment is just what it is in a positive judgment. In neither case is\r\nit constituted an idea by reference to some other content.\r\n\r\nSo far we have outlined Bosanquet's theory of the judgment; have noted\r\nthe apparently insoluble problems inherent in his system, and have\r\nsketched a radically different theory which offered a possible solution\r\nfor his difficulties. It now remains to develop the implications of the\r\nnew theory further by comparing its application to some of the more\r\nimportant problems of logic with that of Bosanquet. In closing we shall\r\nhave to inquire to what extent the new theory of the judgment with its\r\nmetaphysical implications has proved more satisfactory than that of\r\nBosanquet.\r\n\r\nThe special problems to be considered are (1) the relation of judgment\r\nto inference; (2) the parts of the judgment and their relationship; (3)\r\nthe time element in the judgment; and (4) the way in which one judgment\r\ncan be separated from another.\r\n\r\n1. The discussion of the relation between judgment and inference comes\r\nup incidentally in Bosanquet's treatment of the distinction between a\r\njudgment and a proposition (p. 79). The proposition, he says, is merely\r\nthe enunciative sentence which represents the act of thought called\r\njudgment. With this distinction we should agree. In his discussion of\r\nthe point, however, he criticises Hegel's doctrine that a judgment is\r\ndistinguished from a proposition in that a judgment maintains itself\r\nagainst a doubt, while a proposition is a mere temporal affirmation, not\r\nimplying the presence of a doubt. The ground of his criticism is that\r\njudgment must be regarded as operative before the existence of a\r\nconscious doubt, and that, while it is true, as Hegel suggests, that\r\njudgment and inference begin together, they both begin farther back than\r\nthe point at which conscious doubt arises. Doubt marks the point at\r\nwhich inference becomes conscious of its ground. Now, it is undoubted\r\nthat inferences in which the ground is implicit exist at an earlier\r\nstage of experience than those in which it is explicit. The former we\r\nusually call simple apprehension, and the latter judgment. What\r\nBosanquet wishes to do is to make the term \"judgment\" cover both the\r\nimplicit and the explicit activities. The question at once arises\r\nwhether such a use of terms is accurate. There is certainly a wide\r\ndifference between an inference which is conscious of its ground, and\r\none which is not. It is conceivably a distinction of philosophic\r\nimportance. To slur the difference by applying one name to both\r\naccomplishes nothing. It will be remembered that the presence of a\r\nconscious doubt is the criterion of judgment adopted in the standpoint\r\nfrom which we have been criticising Bosanquet's theory. We should\r\naccordingly make the term \"inference\" a wider one than the term\r\n\"judgment.\" A judgment is an inference which is conscious of its ground.\r\nSince fact and idea have been represented as constituted in and through\r\njudgment, the question which at once suggests itself is: What, from such\r\na standpoint, is the criterion of fact and idea in the stage of\r\nexperience previous to the appearance of judgment? The answer is that\r\nthe question involves the psychological fallacy. There is no such\r\ndistinction as fact and idea in experience previous to the appearance of\r\njudgment. The distinction between fact and idea arises only at the\r\nhigher level of experience at which inference becomes conscious of its\r\ngrounds. To ask what they were previous to that is to ask _what_ they\r\nwere before they _were_--a question which, of course, cannot be\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nOur reason for not adopting Hegel's distinction between a judgment and a\r\nproposition would accordingly not be the same as Bosanquet's. The\r\nquestion has already been touched upon in the distinction between dead\r\nand live judgments. What Hegel calls a proposition is really nothing but\r\na dead judgment. His illustration of a temporal affirmation is the\r\nsentence: \"A carriage is passing the house.\" That sentence would be a\r\njudgment, he says, only in case there were some doubt as to whether or\r\nnot a carriage was passing. But the question to be answered first is:\r\nWhen would such a \"statement\" occur in the course of our experience? It\r\nis impossible to conceive of any circumstances in which it would\r\nnaturally occur, unless there were some doubt to be solved either of our\r\nown or of another. Perhaps one is expecting a friend, and does not know\r\nat first whether it is a carriage or a cart which is passing. Perhaps\r\nsome one has been startled, and asks: \"What is this noise?\" What Hegel\r\nwishes to call a proposition is, accordingly, nothing but a judgment\r\ntaken out of its setting.\r\n\r\n2. In dealing with the traditional three parts of the judgment--subject,\r\npredicate, and copula--Bosanquet disposes of the copula at once, by\r\ndividing the judgment into subject and predication. But the two terms\r\n\"subject\" and \"predication\" are not co-ordinate. Subject, as he uses it,\r\nis a static term indicating a _content_. Predication is a dynamic term\r\nindicating the act of predicating. It implies something which is\r\npredicated of something else, _i. e._, two contents and the act of\r\nbringing them into relation. Now, if what we understand by the copula is\r\nthe _act_ of predicating abstracted from the content which is predicated\r\nof another content, then it does not dispose of the copula as a separate\r\nfactor in judgment to include thing predicated and act of predicating\r\nunder the single term \"predication.\" The term \"predication\" might just\r\nas reasonably be made to absorb the subject as well, and would then\r\nappear--as it really is--synonymous with the term \"judgment.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bosanquet's difficulties with the parts of the judgment are not\r\ndisposed of even by the reduction to subject and predication. He goes on\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n    It is plain that the judgment, however complex, is a single idea.\r\n    The relations within it are not relations between ideas, but are\r\n    themselves a part of the idea which is predicated. In other words,\r\n    the subject must be outside the judgment in order that the content\r\n    of the judgment may be predicated of it. If not, we fall back into\r\n    \"my idea of the earth goes round my idea of the sun,\" and this, as\r\n    we have seen, is never the meaning of \"The earth goes round the\r\n    sun.\" What we want is, \"The real world has in it as a fact what I\r\n    mean by earth-going-round-sun.\" (P. 81.)\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out the difficulties into which Bosanquet's\r\npresupposition as to the nature of reality plunges him. This is but\r\nanother technical statement of the same problem. If the subject is\r\nreally outside of judgment, then the entire _content_ of the judgment\r\nmust fall on the side of predicate, or idea. In the paragraphs that\r\nfollow, Bosanquet brings out the point that the judgment must\r\nnevertheless contain the distinction of subject and predicate, since it\r\nis impossible to affirm without introducing a distinction into the\r\n_content_ of the affirmation. Yet he considers this distinction to be\r\n_merely_ a difference within an identity. It serves to mark off the\r\ngrammatical subject and predicate, but cannot be the essential\r\ndistinction of subject and predicate. His solution of the puzzle is\r\nreally the one for which we have been contending, _i. e._, that \"the\r\nreal world is primarily and emphatically my world,\" but he still cannot\r\nbe satisfied with that kind of a real world as ultimate. Behind the\r\nsubject which presents my world he postulates a real world which is not\r\nmy world, but which my world represents. It is the relation between this\r\nreal world and the total content of a judgment which he considers the\r\nessential relation of judgment. This leaves him--as we have pointed\r\nout--as far as ever from a theory of the relation of thought to reality,\r\nand, moreover, with no criterion for the distinction of subject and\r\npredicate within the judgment. To say that it is a difference within an\r\nidentity does not explain how, on a mere basis of content, such a\r\ndifference is distinguished within an identity or how it assumes the\r\nimportance it actually has. He vibrates between taking the whole\r\nintellectual content as predicate, the reality to be represented as\r\nsubject (in which case the copula would be the \"contact of\r\nsense-perception\") and a distinction appearing without reasonable ground\r\nor bearing _within_ the intellectual content. When subject and predicate\r\nare regarded as the contents in which phases of a function appear, this\r\ndifficulty no longer exists.\r\n\r\n3. In discussing the time relations within judgment (p. 85) Bosanquet\r\nfirst disposes of the view which holds that the subject is prior to the\r\npredicate in time, and is distinguished from the predicate by its\r\npriority. He emphasizes the fact that no content of consciousness can\r\nhave the significance of a subject, except with reference to something\r\nalready referred to it as predicate. But while it cannot be true that\r\nthe parts of the judgment fall outside of one another in time, it is yet\r\nevident that in one sense at least the judgment is in time. To make this\r\nclear, Bosanquet draws a provisional distinction between the process of\r\narriving at a judgment and the completed judgment. The process of\r\narriving at a judgment is a process of passing from a subject with an\r\nindefinite provisional predicate--a sort of disjunctive judgment--to a\r\nsubject with a defined predicate. This process is evidently in time, but\r\nit is as evidently not a transition from subject to predicate. It is, as\r\nhe says, a modification, _pari passu_, of both subject and predicate.\r\nThe same distinction, he thinks, must hold of the judgment when\r\ncompleted. But this throws us into a dilemma with reference to the\r\ntime-factor in judgment. Time either is or is not an essential factor in\r\njudgment. If it is not essential, then how explain the evident fact that\r\nthe judgment as an intellectual process does have duration? If it is\r\nessential, then how explain the fact that its parts do not fall outside\r\none another in time? Bosanquet evidently regards the former problem as\r\nthe easier of the two. His solution is that, while the judgment is an\r\nintellectual process in time, still this is a purely external aspect.\r\nThe essential relation between subject and predicate is not in time,\r\nsince they are coexistent; therefore time is not an essential element in\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe first point at which we take issue with this treatment of time in\r\nrelation to judgment is in the distinction between the process of\r\narriving at the judgment and the completed judgment. Bosanquet himself\r\ndefines judgment as an intellectual act by which an ideal content is\r\nreferred to reality. Now, at what point does this act begin? Certainly\r\nat the point where an ideal content is first applying to reality, and\r\nthis, as he points out, is at the beginning of the process which he\r\ndescribes as the process of arriving at a judgment. It is nothing to the\r\npoint that at this stage the predicate is tentative, while later it\r\nbecomes defined. His process of arriving at the judgment is exactly the\r\nprocess we have been describing as the early stages of any and every\r\njudgment. When he talks about the judgment as completed, he has\r\napparently shifted from the dynamic view of judgment implied in his\r\ndefinition to a static view. All he could mean by a completed\r\njudgment--in distinction to the total activity of arriving at a\r\njudgment--is the new content of which we find ourselves possessed when\r\nthe total process of predication is complete. But this content is not a\r\njudgment at all. It is a new construction of reality which may serve\r\neither as subject or as predicate in future judgments.\r\n\r\nNow, if we regard the judgment as the total activity by which an ideal\r\ncontent is referred to reality, then must we not regard time as an\r\nessential element? Bosanquet answers this question in the negative,\r\nbecause he believes that if time is an essential element, then the parts\r\nof the judgment must necessarily fall outside one another in time. But\r\nis this necessary? If the essence of judgment is the very modification,\r\n_pari passu_, of subject and predicate, then time must be an essential\r\nelement in it, but it is not at all necessary that its elements should\r\nfall outside of one another in time. In other words, the dilemma which\r\nBosanquet points out on p. 87 is not a genuine one. There is no\r\ndifficulty involved in admitting that the judgment is a transition in\r\ntime, and still holding that its _parts_ do not fall outside _one\r\nanother_ in time. His own solution of the problem--_i. e._, that,\r\nalthough judgment is an intellectual process in time, still time is not\r\nan essential feature of it, because subject and predicate are coexistent\r\nand judgment is a relation between them--involves a desertion of his\r\ndynamic view of judgment. He defines judgment, not as a relation between\r\nsubject and predicate, but as an intellectual _act_.[53]\r\n\r\n4. The discussion of the time-element in judgment leads up to the next\r\npuzzle--that as to the way in which one judgment can be marked off from\r\nanother in the total activity of thought. Bosanquet has pointed out that\r\nsubject and predicate are both of them present at every stage of the\r\njudging process, and are undergoing progressive modification. If,\r\ntherefore, we take a cross-section of the process at any point, we find\r\nboth subject and predicate present; but a cross-section at one point\r\nwould not reveal quite the same subject and predicate as the\r\ncross-section at another point. He comes to the conclusion that judgment\r\nbreaks up into judgments as rhomboidal spar into rhomboids (p. 88). It\r\nis, accordingly, quite arbitrary to mark out any limits for a single\r\njudgment. The illustration he gives of the point is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Take such an every-day judgment of mixed perception and inference\r\n    as, \"He is coming down stairs and going into the street.\" It is\r\n    the merest chance whether I break up the process thus, into two\r\n    judgments as united by a mere conjunction, or, knowing the man's\r\n    habits, say, when I hear him half way down stairs, \"He is going\r\n    out.\" In the latter case I summarize a more various set of\r\n    observations and inferences in a single judgment; but the judgment\r\n    is as truly single as each of the two which were before separated\r\n    by a conjunction; for each of them was also a summary of a set of\r\n    perceptions, which might, had I chosen, have been subdivided into\r\n    distinct propositions expressing separate judgments; _e. g._, \"He\r\n    has opened his door, and is going toward the staircase, and is\r\n    half way down, and is in the passage,\" etc. If I simply say, \"He\r\n    is going out,\" I am not a whit the less conscious that I judge all\r\n    these different relations, but I then include them all in a single\r\n    systematic content \"going out.\" (P. 89.)\r\n\r\nBut is it a question of merest chance which of these various\r\npossibilities is actualized? Is Bosanquet really looking--as he\r\nthinks--at the actual life of thought, or is he considering, not what as\r\na matter of fact does take place under a concrete set of circumstances,\r\nbut what might take place under slightly differing sets of\r\ncircumstances? If it is true that judgment is a crisis developing\r\nthrough adequate interaction of stimulus and response into a definite\r\nsituation, beginning with doubt and ending with a solution of the doubt,\r\nthen it is not true that its limits are purely arbitrary. It begins with\r\nthe appearance of the problem and its tentative solutions, and ends with\r\nthe solution of a final response. It does, of course, depend upon\r\nmomentary interest, but this does not make its limits arbitrary, for the\r\ninterest is inherent, not external. In the case of Bosanquet's\r\nillustration, the question of whether one judgment or half a dozen is\r\nmade is not a question of merest chance. It depends upon where the\r\ninterest of the person making the judgment is centered--in other words,\r\nupon what is the particular doubt to be solved. If the real doubt is as\r\nto whether the man will stay in his room or go out, then when he is\r\nheard leaving his room the solution comes in the form: \"He is going\r\nout.\" But if the doubt is as to whether he will stay in his room, go\r\nout, or go into some other room, then the succession of judgments\r\noccurs, each of which solves a problem. \"He has opened his door\"--then\r\nhe is not going to stay in his room; \"He is going toward the\r\nstaircase\"--then he is not going into a room in the opposite direction,\r\netc. It is impossible to conceive of such a series of judgments as\r\nactually being made, unless each one represents a problematic situation\r\nand its determination. The only time that a man would, as a matter of\r\nfact, choose to break up the judgment, \"He is going out,\" into such a\r\nseries, would be the time when each member of the series had its own\r\nspecial interest as representing a specific uncertain aim or problem.\r\nNor is it altogether true that in making the judgment, \"He is going\r\nout,\" one is not a whit the less conscious that he judges all these\r\ndifferent relations. He judges only such relations as are necessary to\r\nthe solution of the problem in hand. If hearing the man open his door is\r\na sufficient basis for the solution, then that is the only one which\r\nconsciously enters into the formation of the judgment.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted to bring out in the preceding pages what seem to be\r\nthe contradictions and insoluble problems involved in Bosanquet's theory\r\nof the judgment, and to exhibit them as the logical outcome of his\r\nmetaphysical presuppositions. We have also tried to develop another\r\ntheory of the judgment involving a different view of the nature of\r\nreality, and to show that the new theory is able to avoid the\r\ndifficulties inherent in Bosanquet's system. The change in view-point\r\nbriefly is this: Instead of regarding the real world as self-existent,\r\nindependently of the judgments we make about it, we viewed it as the\r\ntotality of experience which is assured, _i. e._, determined as to\r\ncertainty or specific availability, through the instrumentality of\r\njudgment. We thus avoided the essentially insoluble problem of how a\r\nreal world whose content is self-existent quite outside of knowledge can\r\never be correctly represented by ideas. The difficulty in understanding\r\nthe relation of the subject and the predicate of judgment to reality\r\ndisappears when we cease to regard reality as self-existent outside of\r\nknowledge. Subject and predicate become instrumentalities in the process\r\nof building up reality. Thought no longer seems to carry us farther and\r\nfarther from reality as ideas become abstract and recede from the\r\nimmediate sensory experience in which contact with the real occurs. On\r\nthe contrary, thought carries us constantly toward reality. Finally, we\r\navoid the fundamental skepticism about the possibility of knowledge\r\nwhich, from the other standpoint, is forced upon us by the long\r\nsuccession of facts which have faded into the realm of false opinions,\r\nand the lack of any guarantee that our present so-called knowledge of\r\nreality shall not meet the same fate. From that point of view, reality\r\nseems to be not only unknown, but unknowable.\r\n\r\nThe criticism sure to be passed upon the alternative view developed is\r\nthat the solution of Bosanquet's problems which it affords is not a real\r\nsolution, but rather the abandonment of an attempt at a solution. It\r\nrepresents reality as a thing which is itself in process of development.\r\nIt would force us to admit that the reality of a hundred years ago, or\r\neven of yesterday, was not in content the reality of today. A growing,\r\ndeveloping reality is, it will be said, an imperfect reality, while we\r\nmust conceive of reality as complete and perfect in itself. The only\r\nanswer which can be made is to insist again that we have no right to\r\nassume that reality is such an already completed existence, unless such\r\nan assumption enables us to understand experience and organize it into a\r\nconsistent whole. The attempt of this paper has been to show that such a\r\nconception of reality really makes it inherently impossible to give an\r\nintelligible account of experience as a whole, while the view which\r\nregards reality as developing in and through judgment does enable us to\r\nbuild up a consistent and understandable view of the world. This\r\nsuggests that the \"perfect\" may not after all be that which is finished\r\nand ended, but that whose reality is so abundant and vital as to issue\r\nin continuous self-modification. The Reality that evolves and moves may\r\nbe more perfect, less finite, than that which has exhausted itself.\r\nMoreover, only the view that Reality is developmental in quality, and\r\nthat the instrument of its development is judgment involving the\r\npsychical in its determination of subject and predicate gives the\r\npsychical as such any significant place in knowledge or in reality.\r\nAccording to the view of knowledge as representation of an eternal\r\ncontent, the psychical is a mere logical surd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTYPICAL STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF JUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nLogic aims at investigating the general function of knowing. But\r\nknowing, it is commonly asserted, is constituted as judgment.\r\nFurthermore, there is reason to believe that judgment undergoes\r\nwell-marked changes in its development. Consequently, an understanding\r\nof the judgment-function and of its epochs in development is of prime\r\nimportance. In carrying through the investigation we shall endeavor,\r\nfirst, to state and to defend a certain presupposition with reference to\r\nthe character of the judgment-function; second, to exhibit the\r\napplication of this presupposition in the typical stages of judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nJudgment is essentially _instrumental_. This is the presupposition which\r\nwe must explain and make good. And we shall accomplish this by way of an\r\nanalysis of judgment as meaning.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that what we call knowledge is concerned with the\r\ndiscrimination of valid meaning. To know is to appreciate the _meaning_\r\nof things and the meaning _of things_ is the same with valid meaning.\r\nJudging determines knowledge, and in the same act develops meaning. To\r\nput it otherwise, knowledge is a matter of _content_; _content_ is\r\n_meaning_, and we have knowledge when we have meaning satisfactorily\r\ndetermined. It is evident, therefore, that if we would understand the\r\njudging-function, we must first make clear to ourselves the nature and\r\nrôle of _meaning_.\r\n\r\nMeaning is universally embodied in _ideas_. To know, to understand the\r\nmeaning, to get ideas, are the same. Now, in ideas two factors may be\r\ndistinguished. First, every idea has as its base an image or emphasized\r\nportion of experience. In some forms of ideation we are more immediately\r\naware of the presence of images than in others, but no idea--even the\r\nmost abstract--can exist apart from an ultimate base. Second, every idea\r\nis equally a function of _reference_ and _control_. As _reference_, the\r\nidea projects in the mind's view an anticipation of experiences and of\r\nthe conditions upon which these experiences depend for their\r\nrealization; as _control_, ideas are agencies in turning anticipations\r\ninto realizations.[54]\r\n\r\nTo be more specific on both points: Since the days of Galton it has been\r\nalmost a commonplace in psychology that ideas are embodied in forms of\r\nimagery which vary for and in different individuals. It has been\r\nmaintained, it is true, that in abstract forms of thought, imagery\r\ndisappears. This objection is met in two ways. For one, words--the\r\nvehicle of many abstract ideas--involve imagery of a most pronounced\r\ntype: for another, every idea, when examined closely, discloses an\r\nimage, no matter how much for the time being this has been driven into\r\nobscurity by the characteristics of reference and control. Furthermore,\r\nwhen we examine the anticipatory aspect of ideas, the presence of\r\nimagery both with reference to outcome and to conditions is so evident\r\nthat its presence will scarcely be denied.\r\n\r\nThe second point may be illustrated in several ways. In everyday life\r\nanticipation and realization are inseparable from the nature and use of\r\nideas. \"Hat\" means anticipation of protection to the head and the\r\ntendency toward setting in motion the conditions appropriate to the\r\nrealization of this anticipation. The same factors are evident in the\r\nboy's definition of a knife as \"something to whittle with.\" Again it is\r\nmaintained that intelligence is an essential factor in human\r\nself-consciousness. By this is meant that human beings are universally\r\naware in some degree of what they are about. And this awareness consists\r\nin understanding the meaning of their actions, of forecasting the\r\noutcome of various kinds of activity, of apprehending beforehand the\r\nconditions connected with determinate results. Within this sphere we\r\nspeak of certain men as being pre-eminently intelligent, meaning that\r\nfor such men outcomes are previewed and connected with their appropriate\r\nconditions far beyond the range of ordinary foresight. Finally,\r\nscientific intelligence is essentially of this kind. It aims at\r\nunderstanding the varying types of process which operate in nature and\r\nthus at possessing itself of information with reference to results to be\r\nexpected under determinate conditions. For example, the knowledge\r\nacquired in his researches by Louis Pasteur enabled him to predict the\r\nlife or death of animals inoculated with charbon virus according as they\r\nhad or had not been vaccinated previously. His information, in other\r\nwords, became an instrument for the control and eradication of the\r\ndisease. And what is true of this case is true of all science. To the\r\nscientist ideas are \"working hypotheses\" and have their value only as\r\nthey enable him to predict, and to control. And while it is true that\r\nthe scientist usually overlooks the so-called _practical_ value of his\r\ndiscoveries, it is none the less true that in due time the inventor\r\nfollows the investigator. The investigator is content to construct and\r\nshow the truth of his idea. The inventor assumes the truth of the\r\ninvestigator's work and carries his idea as a constructive principle\r\ninto the complications of life. To both men \"knowledge is power,\"\r\nalthough the \"power\" may be realized in connection with different\r\ninterests. But if this be true, ideas can no longer be regarded as\r\ncopies in individual experience of some pre-existing reality. They are\r\nrather instruments for transforming and directing experience, by way of\r\nconstructing anticipations and the conditions appropriate to their\r\nrealization. Herein also consists their truth or falsity. The true idea\r\nis reliable, carrying us from anticipation to realization; the false\r\nidea is unreliable, and fails in bringing the promised result.\r\n\r\nNow, in the development of instruments generally, we may distinguish a\r\nrule-of-thumb or more or less unreflective stage of construction, and\r\none entirely reflective. As to use there is the distinction of inexpert\r\nand expert control. This leads us to expect that in the thought-function\r\nalso certain typical stages of construction and of control may be found.\r\nTo the investigation of this point we shall next direct attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn its development from crude to expert forms judgment exhibits three\r\ntypical stages--_the impersonal_, _the reflective_, and _the intuitive_.\r\nThese we shall consider in order of development. But first it is to be\r\nnoticed that these stages of judgment are not to be regarded as hard and\r\nfast distinctions of the kind that no indications of the higher are to\r\nbe found in the lower types, but rather as working distinctions within a\r\nprocess of continuous development.\r\n\r\n1. _The impersonal judgment._--Ever since the days of the Greek\r\ngrammarians the impersonal judgment has been considered an anomaly in\r\nlogic. And the reason is not far to seek. From the time of Aristotle it\r\nhas been customary to maintain that judgments, when analyzed, disclose a\r\nsubject and a predicate. Logically considered, these appear to be\r\nentirely correlative, for, as Erdmann puts it,[55] \"an event without a\r\nsubstrate, a quality without a subject, is altogether unpresentable.\"\r\nBut there is in all languages a class of judgments, such as, \"It rains,\"\r\n\"It snows,\" \"Fire!\" in which no directly asserted subject is\r\ndiscoverable. To these the name impersonal and subjectless has been\r\ngiven. Here then is the difficulty. If we admit that the impersonal\r\nexpression involves predication, we must, in all consistency, search for\r\na subject, while at the same time the subject refuses to disclose\r\nitself. In ancient days the orthodox logician confined his search to\r\nlanguage and to the spoken or written proposition. The unorthodox critic\r\nmaintained, in opposition to this, that a subject was provided only by\r\nwarping and twisting the natural sense of the impersonal expression. And\r\nthus the matter stood until the development of modern comparative\r\nphilology. It was then demonstrated beyond the possibility of doubt that\r\nthe \"it\" (or its equivalent) of the impersonal is a purely contentless\r\nform word. Language provides no subject whatsoever. So strong, however,\r\nis the hold of tradition that the search has been renewed. Attention has\r\nbeen turned upon the mental processes involved, and this time with more\r\napparent result. Although there has been no general agreement with\r\nreference to the subject, a classification of the different views may\r\nstill be made. (_a_) The subject is universal and undetermined; (_b_) it\r\nis individual and more or less determined; (_c_) between these extremes\r\nlies almost every intermediate degree conceivable.\r\n\r\nUeberweg maintains that the subject of the impersonal is the actual\r\ntotality of present experience. When we ask, \"What rains?\" we must\r\nunderstand a reference to our general environment, in which no special\r\nelement is singled out. Sigwart, on the other hand, maintains that the\r\nsubject can be construed only as the actual sense-impression. This\r\ndiversity of opinion might seem to indicate that, were it not for the\r\nconstraining power of theory, a subject would scarcely be thought of\r\nfor the impersonal. Still it must be admitted that when we examine the\r\nimpersonal expression closely we can discover a sense-impression,\r\nwhether definite or indefinite, combined with an idea. This would seem\r\nto give the case to the orthodox logician, for he will at once claim the\r\nsense-impression as the subject and the idea as the predicate of the\r\njudgment. But we must have a care. Predication is usually held to\r\nconsist in a _reference_ of predicate _to_ subject. The factors of the\r\njudgment are, as it were, held apart. In the impersonal no such thing as\r\nthis can be discovered. The meaning is so close a unity that impression\r\nand idea are entirely fused. We may analyze the expression and find them\r\nthere, but by so doing we destroy the immediacy which is an essential\r\ncharacteristic of the impersonal. In other words, the impersonal does\r\nnot analyze itself. It is entirely unconscious of its make-up. And yet\r\nit is definite and applies itself with precision: If I am in a\r\nlecture-hall and hear the fire-alarm, the thought \"Fire!\" which enters\r\nmy mind leads to an immediate change in my conduct. I arise, move\r\nquietly out, and prepare for duty. If, on the other hand, I open the\r\nstreet door and the rain strikes my face, I ejaculate \"Raining!\" turn,\r\nreach for my umbrella, and pass out protected. In both cases I act\r\n_knowingly_ and with _meaning_, but I do not analyze the movement either\r\nof thought or of action. A correlate to the unreflective impersonal\r\njudgment is found in early custom. Custom embodies social ideas and is\r\nan instrument for the determination and control of action. Individuals\r\nmoved by custom know what they are about and act with precision\r\naccording as custom may demand. But it is notorious that custom is\r\ndirect and unreflective. It represents social instruments of control\r\nwhich have grown up without method and which represent the slow\r\naccretion of rule-of-thumb activities through many ages. So in the\r\nimpersonal judgment we have a type of intellectual instrument which has\r\nbeen brought to a high degree of precision in use, but which still\r\nretains the simplicity and certainty of an unquestioned instrument of\r\naction. For this reason, whatever complexity of elements the impersonal\r\nmay present to a reflective view, it does not contain to itself.\r\nConsequently it may be best to say that to the impersonal there is\r\nneither subject, predicate, nor reference of the one to the other. These\r\nare distinctions which arise only when the instrument of action has been\r\nquestioned and the mind turns back upon the meaning which it has\r\nunhesitatingly used, analyzing, investigating, constructing, laying bare\r\nthe method and function of its tools. Thus arises a new and distinctive\r\ntype of judgment, viz., the reflective.\r\n\r\n2. _The reflective judgment._--By the reflective judgment is to be\r\nunderstood that form of meaning whose structure and function have become\r\na problem to itself. The days of naïve trust and spontaneous action have\r\ngone by. Inquiry, criticism, aloofness, stay the tendency to immediate\r\naction. Meaning has grown worldly wise and demands that each situation\r\nshall explain itself and that the general principles and concrete\r\napplications of its own instruments shall be made manifest. Hence in the\r\nvarious forms of reflective thought we find the progressive steps in\r\nwhich meaning comes to full consciousness of its function in experience.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrative judgment (the simplest of the reflective type) carries\r\ndoubt, criticism, construction, and assertion written on the face of it.\r\nFor example, in the expression, \"That is hot,\" we do not find the\r\ndirectness and immediacy of response characteristic of the simpler\r\nimpersonal \"hot.\" Instead, we note a clash of tendencies, a suspension\r\nof the proposed action, a demand for and a carrying out of a\r\nreconsideration of the course of action, the emergence of a new meaning,\r\nand the consequent redirection of activities. An iron lies upon the\r\nhearth; I stretch out my hand to return it to its place; I stop\r\nsuddenly, having become conscious of signs of warmth; the thought arises\r\nin my mind, \"That is hot;\" I experiment and find my judgment correct; I\r\nsearch for a cloth, and thus protected carry out my first intention.\r\nAgain, a hunter notes a movement in the thicket, quickly raises his gun,\r\nand is about to fire. Something in the movement of the object arrests\r\nhim. He stops, thinking, \"That is a man, perhaps.\" What has caught the\r\neye has arrested his action, has become a demand, and not until the\r\nsituation has become clear can the hunter determine what to do. In other\r\nwords, he must reflectively assure himself what the object is before he\r\ncan satisfy himself as to how he should act. Subject and predicate have\r\narisen and have consciously played their parts in the passage from doubt\r\nto decision.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading \"individual judgments\" are classed such expressions\r\nas, \"That ship is a man-o'-war,\" \"Russia opposes the policy of the open\r\ndoor in China.\" In both these cases it is evident that an advance in\r\ndefiniteness of conception and of complexity of meaning has been made,\r\nwhile at the same time we recognize that the instrumental\r\ncharacteristics of the thought-movement remain the same. In considering\r\nthe subject of the judgment we note that the stimulus presents itself\r\npartly as a determinate factor and partly as a problem--an insistent\r\ndemand. The expression, \"That ship is a man-o'-war,\" might be written,\r\n\"That is a ship and of the kind man-o'-war,\" and it thus constitutes\r\nwhat Sigwart calls a \"double synthesis.\" As used in actual judgment,\r\nhowever, the two are held together and constitute the statement of a\r\nsingle stimulus of which a certain portion is evident and a certain\r\nportion is in doubt. The working out of the difficulty is given in the\r\npredicate \"is a man-o'-war,\" in which we at once detect the instrumental\r\ncharacteristics fundamental to all judgment. To illustrate: At the\r\nclose of the battle of Santiago, in the Spanish-American war, smoke\r\nappeared upon the horizon revealing the presence of a strange ship.\r\nInstantly attention was directed to it, and it became a problem for\r\naction--a demand for instrumental information. Soon it was identified as\r\na man-o'-war, and the American ships were cleared for action. Closer\r\napproach raised a further question with reference to its nationality.\r\nAfter some debate this also was resolved, and hostile demonstrations\r\nwere abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe universal judgment is sometimes said to exhibit two distinct forms.\r\nInvestigation, however, has proved this statement to be incorrect.\r\nInstances taken in themselves and apart from their character are of no\r\nlogical significance. Advance is made by weighing instances and not by\r\ncounting them. In short, the true universal is the hypothetical\r\njudgment, and the reason for this may be readily shown. The hypothetical\r\njudgment is essentially double-ended. On the one hand, it is a statement\r\nof the problem of action in terms of the conditions which will turn the\r\nproblem into a solution. On the other hand, it is an assertion that once\r\nthe conditions of action have been determined the result desired may be\r\nattained. Here we note that the judgment has come to clear consciousness\r\nof itself and of the part which it plays in experience. It has now\r\nobtained an insight into the criterion of its legitimate employment,\r\n_i. e._, of its truth and falsity. And this insight makes the\r\njustification of its claim almost self-evident. For, inasmuch as the\r\nhypothetical judgment says, \"If such and such conditions be realized,\r\nsuch and such a result will be obtained,\" the test of the claim is made\r\nby putting the conditions into effect and watching whether the promised\r\nexperience is given. And further, since it has been found that the\r\njudgment formulated as a hypothesis actually accomplishes what it\r\npromises, we must admit that the hypothetical judgment is also\r\ncategorical. These two factors cannot be separated from each other. It\r\nis true that the hypothetical judgment reduces every valid meaning to\r\nthe form, \"_If_ certain conditions be realized,\" but it as plainly and\r\npositively asserts, \"such and such results _will_ be obtained.\" When we\r\ngrasp the absolute correlativity of the hypothetical and categorical\r\naspects of judgment, we realize at once the essentially instrumental\r\ncharacter of judgment, when it comes to consciousness of its structure\r\nand function. It arises in the self-conscious realization of a problem.\r\nThis it reflects upon and sizes up. When the difficulty has been\r\napprehended, the judgment emerges as the consciousness of the conditions\r\nwhich will attain the desired end of action freed and unimpeded. This\r\nmay be illustrated by reference to the work of Pasteur cited above. His\r\ninvestigations began in a problem set for him by agricultural conditions\r\nin France. A certain disease had made the profitable rearing of sheep\r\nand cattle almost an impossibility. After long and careful examination\r\nhe discovered the beneficial effects of vaccination. To him the\r\nconditions which governed the presence of the disease became apparent,\r\nand this knowledge furnished him with an instrument by means of which\r\none difficulty was removed from the path of the stock-raiser. In this\r\nillustration we have an epitome of the work accomplished everywhere by\r\nthe scientist. It is his task to develop and to reduce to exact terms\r\ninstruments of control for the varied activities of life. In its parts\r\nand as a whole each instrument is intelligently constructed and tested\r\nso that its make-up and function are exactly known. Because of this,\r\nreasoned belief now takes the place of unreflective trust as that was\r\nexperienced in the impersonal stage of judgment. What at first hand\r\nmight appear to be a loss was in reality a gain; the breakdown of the\r\nimpersonal was the first step in the development of an instrument of\r\naction conscious of its reason for being, its methods and conditions of\r\naction. These latter constitute the distinctive subject and predicate of\r\nthe reflective judgment.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the connection between the hypothetical character of\r\nthis form of judgment and its universality. And this perhaps will now be\r\nquite apparent. The reflective judgment lays bare an objective\r\nconnection between the conditions and outcomes of actions. It proves its\r\npoint by actually constructing the event. Such being the case,\r\nuniversality is no more than a statement of identical results being\r\npredictable wherever like conditions are realized. If it be true that\r\n\"man is mortal,\" then it is an identical statement to insist that,\r\n\"Wherever we find men there we shall also find mortality.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this point brings us naturally to the treatment of the disjunctive\r\njudgment: \"A is either B or C or D.\" In the disjunctive judgment the\r\ndemand is not for the construction of a reliable instrument of action,\r\nbut for the resolution of a doubt as to which instrument is precisely\r\nfitted to the circumstances. In fact, the disjunctive judgment involves\r\nthe identification of the practical problem. When we say of a man, \"He\r\nis either very simple or very deep,\" we have no doubt as to our proper\r\ncourse of action in either case. If he is simple, then we shall do so\r\nand so; if he is deep, then another course of action follows. We can lay\r\nout alternative courses beforehand, but the point of difficulty lies\r\nhere: \"But just which is he?\" In short, the disjunctive judgment is the\r\ndemand for and the attempt at a precise diagnosis of a concrete problem.\r\nTo illustrate: A patient afflicted with aphasia is brought to a\r\nphysician. The fact that the trouble is aphasia may be quite evident.\r\nBut what precisely is the form and seat of the aphasia? To the mind of\r\nthe educated physician the problem will take on the disjunctive form:\r\n\"This is either subcortical or cortical aphasia. If subcortical,\r\nintelligence will not be impaired; if cortical, the sensor and motor\r\ntracts will be in good condition.\" Appropriate tests are made and the\r\nsubcortical possibilities are shut out. The disjunction disappears and\r\nthe judgment emerges: \"This is a case of cortical aphasia.\" But now a\r\nnew disjunction arises. It is either the sensory or motor form of\r\ncortical aphasia, and, whichever one of these, it is again one of\r\nseveral possibilities. As the alternatives arise, the means for\r\ndiscriminating them arise also; determinate symptoms are observed, and\r\nin due time the physician arrives at the final conclusion: \"This is\r\nsensory cortical aphasia of the visual type.\" Having determined this,\r\nhis method of action is assured, and he proceeds to the appropriate\r\noperation. Thus, finally, we are brought to a form of judgment aware not\r\nonly of its motive, method, and justification, but also to one aware of\r\nits specific application to individual cases. Thus it would seem as\r\nthough judgment had returned upon itself and had completed the\r\ndetermination of its sphere of action. And in one sense this is true. In\r\nthe disjunctive judgment, as inclusive of the motives of the\r\nhypothetical and categorical forms, the reflective judgment would appear\r\nto have come to its limit of development. One thing, however, remains to\r\nbe considered, viz., the development from crude to expert uses of\r\nintellectual instruments.\r\n\r\n3. _The intuitive judgment._--As stated above, the intuitive type of\r\njudgment depends upon efficiency in the use of judgment. In this regard\r\nthere is a great similarity between the impersonal and the intuitive\r\njudgments. Both are immediate and precise. But there is a radical and\r\nessential difference. The impersonal judgment knows nothing of the\r\nstrict analysis, insight, and constructive power of the reflective\r\njudgment. The intuitive judgment, on the other hand, includes the\r\nresults of reflection and brings them to their highest power.\r\nParadoxically put, in the intuitive judgment there is so much reflection\r\nthat there is no need for it at all. To the intuitive judgment there is\r\nno hesitation, no aloofness. Action is direct, but entirely\r\nself-conscious. That such a type of judgment as the intuitive exists\r\nthere can be no doubt. There is all the difference in the world between\r\nthe quality of consciousness of a mere layman and that of an expert, no\r\nmatter what the line. The layman must size up a situation. It is a\r\nprocess whose parts are successive, whether much or little difficulty be\r\nexperienced. For the expert situations are taken in at a glance, parts\r\nand whole are simultaneous and immediate. Yet the meaning is entirely\r\nexact. The expert judgment is self-conscious to the last degree. While\r\nother individuals are thinking out what to do, the expert has it, sees\r\nthe advantage, adjusts, and moves. Demand and solution jump together.\r\nHow otherwise can we explain, for example, the action of an expert\r\nball-player? Witness his rapid reactions, his instantaneous adjustments.\r\nMistakes of opponents which would never be noticed by the average player\r\nare recognized and seized upon. On the instant the new opening is seen,\r\nthe adjustment is evident, the movement made. Illustrations to the same\r\neffect could be drawn from other modes of life, _e. g._, music, the\r\nmilitary life, etc. That intuitive judgments are not more common is a\r\nproof in itself of their distinctive character and value. Only in so far\r\nas we become experts in our special fields of experience and have\r\nreduced our instruments of action to precise control, can we expect the\r\npresence of intuitive judgments. They remain, therefore, as the final\r\noutcome of the judgment-function made perfect in its technique and use.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we shall make a brief summary of our investigation and a\r\ncriticism of certain current theories of judgment.\r\n\r\nJudgment is essentially instrumental. Its function is to construct,\r\njustify, and refine experience into exact instruments for the direction\r\nand control of future experience through action. It exhibits itself\r\nfirst in the form of instruments developed unsystematically in response\r\nto the hard necessities of life. In a higher stage of development the\r\ninstrumental process itself is taken into account, and systematically\r\ndeveloped until in the methodical procedure of science the general\r\nprinciples of knowledge are laid bare and efficient instruments of\r\naction constructed. Finally, constant, intelligent use results in\r\ncomplete control, so that within certain spheres doubt and hesitancy\r\nwould seem to disappear as to the character of the tools used, and\r\nremain only as a moment in determining their wisest or most appropriate\r\nemploy.\r\n\r\nThe criticism indicated is based upon the instrumental character of\r\njudgment and is directed against all theories which contend that\r\nknowledge is a \"copying\" or \"reproducing\" of reality. In whatever form\r\nthis \"copy\" theory be stated, the question inevitably arises how we can\r\ncompare our ideas with reality and thus know their truth. On this\r\ntheory, what we possess is ever the copy; the reality is beyond. In\r\nother words, such a theory logically carried out leads to the breakdown\r\nof knowledge. Only a theory which contains and constructs its criterion\r\nwithin its own specific movement can verify its constructions. Such a\r\ntheory is the instrumental. Judgment constructs a situation in\r\nconsciousness. The values assigned in this situation have a determining\r\ninfluence upon values further appreciated. The construction arrived at\r\nconcerns future weal and woe. Thus gradually a sense of truth and\r\nfalsity attaches to the construing of situations. One sees that he\r\n_must_ look beyond _this_ situation, because the way he estimates _this_\r\nsituation is fraught with meaning beyond itself. Hence the critically\r\nreflective judgment in which hesitancy and doubt direct themselves at\r\nthe attitude, elements, and tools involved in defining and identifying\r\nthe situation, instead of at the situation itself _in toto_. Instead of\r\ndeveloping a complex of experience through assigning qualities and\r\nmeanings to the _situation_ as such, some one of the quales is selected,\r\nto have _its_ significance determined. It becomes, _pro tempore_, the\r\nsituation judged. Or the same thing takes place as regards some \"idea\"\r\nor value hitherto immediately fastened upon and employed. In either case\r\nwe get the reflective judgment, the judgment of pure relationship as\r\ndistinct from the constructive judgment. But the judgment of relation,\r\nemploying the copula to refer a specified predicate to a specified\r\nobject, is after all only for the sake of controlling some immediate\r\njudgment of constructive experience. It realizes itself in forming the\r\nconfident habit of prompt and precise mental adjustment to\r\nindividualized situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF HYPOTHESIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the various discussions of the hypothesis which have appeared in\r\nworks on inductive logic and in writings on scientific method, its\r\nstructure and function have received considerable attention, while its\r\norigin has been comparatively neglected. The hypothesis has generally\r\nbeen treated as that part of scientific procedure which marks the stage\r\nwhere a definite plan or method is proposed for dealing with new or\r\nunexplained facts. It is regarded as an invention for the purpose of\r\nexplaining the given, as a definite conjecture which is to be tested by\r\nan appeal to experience to see whether deductions made in accordance\r\nwith it will be found true in fact. The function of the hypothesis is to\r\nunify, to furnish a method of dealing with things, and its structure\r\nmust be suitable to this end. It must be so formed that it will be\r\nlikely to prove valid, and writers have formulated various rules to be\r\nfollowed in the formation of hypotheses. These rules state the main\r\nrequirements of a good hypothesis, and are intended to aid in a general\r\nway by pointing out certain limits within which it must fall.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the origin of the hypothesis, writers have usually\r\ncontented themselves with pointing out the kind of situations in which\r\nhypotheses are likely to appear. But after this has been done, after\r\nfavorable external conditions have been given, the rest must be left to\r\n\"genius,\" for hypotheses arise as \"happy guesses,\" for which no rule or\r\nlaw can be given. In fact, the genius differs from the ordinary plodding\r\nmortal in just this ability to form fruitful hypotheses in the midst of\r\nthe same facts which to other less gifted individuals remain only so\r\nmany disconnected experiences.\r\n\r\nThis unequal stress which has been laid on the structure and function of\r\nthe hypothesis in comparison with its origin may be attributed to three\r\nreasons: (1) The facts, or data, which constitute the working material\r\nof hypotheses are regarded as given to all alike, and all alike are more\r\nor less interested in systematizing and unifying experience. The purpose\r\nof the hypothesis and the opportunity for forming it are thus\r\npractically the same for all, and hence certain definite rules can be\r\nlaid down which will apply to all cases where hypotheses are to be\r\nemployed. (2) But beyond this there seems to be no clue that can be\r\nformulated. There is apparently a more or less open acceptance of the\r\nfinal answer of the boy Zerah Colburn, who, when pressed to give an\r\nexplanation of his method of instantaneous calculation, exclaimed in\r\ndespair: \"God put it into my head, and I can't put it into yours.\"[56]\r\n(3) And, furthermore, there is very often a strong tendency to disregard\r\ninvestigation into the origin of that which is taken as given, for,\r\nsince it is already present, its origin, whatever it may have been, can\r\nhave nothing to do with what it is now. The facts, the data, are _here_,\r\nand must be dealt with as they _are_. Their past, their history or\r\ndevelopment, is entirely irrelevant. So, even if we could trace the\r\nhypothesis farther back on the psychological side, the investigation\r\nwould be useless, for the rules to which a good hypothesis must conform\r\nwould remain the same.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it can be shown that Zerah Colburn's ultimate explanation\r\nis needed in logic as little as Laplace asserted a similar one to be\r\nrequired in his celestial mechanics, it may at least be possible to\r\ndefer it to some extent by means of a further psychological inquiry. It\r\nwill be found that psychological inquiry into the origin of the\r\nhypothesis is not irrelevant in respect to an understanding of its\r\nstructure and function; for origin and function cannot be understood\r\napart from each other, and, since structure must be adapted to function,\r\nit cannot be independent of origin. In fact, origin, structure, and\r\nfunction are organically connected, and each loses its meaning when\r\nabsolutely separated from each other. It will be found, moreover, that\r\nthe data which are commonly taken as the given material are not\r\nsomething to which the hypothesis is subsequently applied, but that,\r\ninstead of this external relation between data and hypothesis, the\r\nhypothesis exercises a directive function in determining what are the\r\ndata. In a word, the main object of this discussion will be to contend\r\nagainst making a merely convenient and special way of regarding the\r\nhypothesis a full and adequate one. Though we speak of facts and of\r\nhypotheses that may be applied to them, it must not be forgotten that\r\nthere are no facts which remain the same whatever hypothesis be applied\r\nto them; and that there are no hypotheses which are hypotheses at all\r\nexcept in reference to their function in dealing with our subject-matter\r\nin such a way as to facilitate its factual apprehension. Data are\r\nselected in order to be determined, and hypotheses are the ways in which\r\nthis determination is carried on. If, as we shall attempt to show, the\r\nrelation between data and hypothesis is not external, but strictly\r\ncorrelative, it is evident that this fact must be taken into account in\r\nquestions concerning deduction and induction, analytic and synthetic\r\njudgments, and the criterion of truth. Its bearing must be recognized in\r\nthe investigation of metaphysical problems as well, for reality cannot\r\nbe independent of the knowing process. In a word, the purpose of this\r\ndiscussion of the hypothesis is to determine its nature a little more\r\nprecisely through an investigation of its rather obscure origin, and to\r\ncall attention to certain features of its function which have not\r\ngenerally been accorded their due significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n_The hypothesis as predicate._--It is generally admitted that the\r\nfunction of the hypothesis is to provide a way of dealing with the data\r\nor subject-matter which we need to organize. In this use of the\r\nhypothesis it appears in the rôle of predicate in a judgment of which\r\nthe data, or facts, to be construed constitute the subject.\r\n\r\nIn his attempts to reduce the movements of the planets about the sun to\r\nsome general formula, Kepler finally hit upon the law since known as\r\nKepler's law, viz., that the squares of the periodic times of the\r\nseveral planets are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances\r\nfrom the sun. This law was first tentatively advanced as a hypothesis.\r\nKepler was not certain of its truth till it had proved its claim to\r\nacceptance. Neither did Newton have at first any great degree of\r\nassurance in regard to his law of gravitation, and was ready to give it\r\nup when he failed in his first attempt to test it by observation of the\r\nmoon. And the same thing may be said about the caution of Darwin and\r\nother investigators in regard to accepting hypotheses. The only reason\r\nfor their extreme care in not accepting at once their tentative\r\nformulations or suggestions was the fear that some other explanation\r\nmight be the correct one. This rejection of other possibilities is the\r\nnegative side of the matter. We become confident that our hypothesis is\r\nthe right one as we lose confidence in other possible explanations; and\r\nit might be added, without falling into a circle, that we lose\r\nconfidence in the other possibilities as we become more convinced of our\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt appears that such may be the relation of the positive and negative\r\nsides in case of such elaborate hypotheses as those of Kepler and\r\nNewton; but is it true where our hypotheses are more simple? It is not\r\neasy to understand why the fact that the hypothesis is more simple, and\r\nthe time required for its formulation and test a good deal shorter,\r\nshould materially change the state of affairs. The question remains:\r\nWhy, if there is no opposition, should there be any uncertainty? In all\r\ninstances, then, the hypothesis appears as one among other possible\r\npredicates which may be applied to our data taken as subject-matter of a\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n_The predicate as hypothesis._--Suppose, then, the hypothesis is a\r\npredicate; is the predicate necessarily a hypothesis? This is the next\r\nquestion we are called upon to answer, and, since the predicate cannot\r\nvery well be taken aside from the judgment, our question involves the\r\nnature of the judgment.\r\n\r\nWhile it will not be necessary to give a very complete account of the\r\nvarious definitions of the judgment that might be adduced, still the\r\nmention of a few of the more prominent ones may serve to indicate that\r\nsomething further is needed. In definitions of the judgment sometimes\r\nthe subjective side is emphasized, sometimes the objective side, and in\r\nother instances there are attempts to combine the two. For instance,\r\nLotze regards the judgment as the idea of a unity or relation between\r\ntwo concepts, with the further implication that this connection holds\r\ntrue of the object referred to. J. S. Mill says that every proposition\r\neither affirms or denies existence, coexistence, sequence, causation, or\r\nresemblance. Trendelenburg regards the judgment as a form of thought\r\nwhich corresponds to the real connection of things, while Ueberweg\r\nstates the case a little differently, and says that the essence of\r\njudgment consists in recognizing the objective validity of a subjective\r\nconnection of ideas. Royce points to a process of imitation and holds\r\nthat in the judgment we try to portray by means of the ideas that enter\r\ninto it. Ideas are imitative in their nature. Sigwart's view of the\r\njudgment is that in it we say something about something. With him the\r\njudgment is a synthetic process, while Wundt considers its nature\r\nanalytic and holds that, instead of uniting, or combining, concepts into\r\na whole, it separates them out of a total idea or presentation. Instead\r\nof blending parts into a whole, it separates the whole into its\r\nconstituent parts. Bradley and Bosanquet both hold that in the judgment\r\nan ideal content comes into relation with reality. Bradley says that in\r\nevery judgment reality is qualified by an idea, which is symbolic. The\r\nideal content is recognized as such, and is referred to a reality beyond\r\nthe act. This is the essence of judgment. Bosanquet seems to perceive a\r\ncloser relation between idea and reality, for although he says that\r\njudgment is the \"intellectual function which defines reality by\r\nsignificant ideas,\" he also tells us that \"the subject is both in and\r\nout of the judgment, as Reality is both in and out of my consciousness.\"\r\n\r\nIn all these definitions of judgment the predicate appears as ideal. An\r\nideal content is predicated of something, whether we regard this\r\nsomething as an idea or as reality beyond, or as reality partly within\r\nand partly without the act of judging; and it is ideal whether we\r\nconsider it as one of the three parts into which judgments are usually\r\ndivided, or whether we say, with Bosanquet and Bradley, that subject,\r\npredicate, and copula all taken together form a single ideal content,\r\nwhich is somehow applied to reality. Moreover, we not only judge about\r\nreality, but it seems to be quite immaterial to reality whether we judge\r\nconcerning it or not.\r\n\r\nMany of our judgments prove false. Not only do we err in our judgments,\r\nbut we often hesitate in making them for fear of being wrong; we feel\r\nthere are other possibilities, and our predication becomes tentative.\r\nHere we have something very like the hypothesis, for our ideal content\r\nshows itself to be a tentative attempt in the presence of alternatives\r\nto qualify and systematize reality. It appears, then, on the basis of\r\nthe views of the judgment that have been mentioned, that not only do we\r\nfind the hypothesis taking its place as the predicate of a judgment, but\r\nthe predicate is itself essentially of the nature of a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn the views of the judgment so far brought out, reality, with which it\r\nis generally admitted that the judgment attempts to deal in some way,\r\nappears to lie outside the act of judging. Now, everyone would say that\r\nwe make some advance in judging, and that we have a better grasp of\r\nthings after than before. But how is this possible if reality lies\r\nwithout or beyond our act of judging? Is the reality we now have the\r\nsame that we had to begin with? If so, then we have made no advance as\r\nfar as the real itself is concerned. If merely our conception of it has\r\nchanged, then it is not clear why we may not be even worse off than\r\nbefore. If reality does lie beyond our judgment, then how, in the nature\r\nof the case, can we ever know whether we have approached it or have gone\r\nstill farther away? To make any claim of approximation implies that we\r\ndo reach reality in some measure, at least, and, if so, it is difficult\r\nto understand how it lies beyond, and is independent of, the act of\r\njudging.\r\n\r\n_Further analysis of judgment._--It remains to be seen whether a further\r\ninvestigation of the judgment will still show the predicate to be a\r\nhypothesis. It is evident that in some cases the judgment appears at the\r\nend of a more or less pronounced reflective process, during which other\r\npossible judgments have suggested themselves, but have been rejected.\r\nThe history of scientific discovery is filled with cases which\r\nillustrate the nature of the process by which a new theory is developed.\r\nFor instance, in Darwin's _Formation of Vegetable Mould through the\r\nAction of Earth Worms_, we find the record of successive steps in the\r\ndevelopment of his hypothesis. Darwin suspected from his observations\r\nthat vegetable mold was due to some agency which was not yet determined.\r\nHe reasoned that if vegetable mold is the result of the life-habits of\r\nearthworms, _i. e._, if earth is brought up by them from beneath the\r\nsurface and afterward spread out by wind and rain, then small objects\r\nlying on the surface of the ground would tend to disappear gradually\r\nbelow the surface. Facts seemed to support his theory, for layers of red\r\nsand, pieces of chalk, and stones were found to have disappeared below\r\nthe surface in a greater or less degree. A common explanation had been\r\nthat heavy objects tend to sink in soft soil through their own weight,\r\nbut the earthworm hypothesis led to a more careful examination of the\r\ndata. It was found that the weight of the object and the softness of the\r\nground made no marked difference, for sand and light objects sank, and\r\nthe ground was not always soft. In general, it was shown that where\r\nearthworms were found vegetable mold was also present, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nIn this investigation of Darwin's the conflicting explanations of\r\nsinking stones appear within the main question of the formation of\r\nvegetable mold by earthworms. The facts that disagreed with the old\r\ntheory about sinking stones were approached through this new one. But\r\nthe theories had something in common, viz., the disappearance of the\r\nstones or other objects: they differed in their further determination of\r\nthis disappearance. In this case it may seem as if the facts which were\r\nopposed to the current theory of sinking stones were seen to be\r\ndiscrepant only after the earthworm hypothesis had been advanced; the\r\nconflict between the new facts and the old theory appears to have\r\narisen through the influence of the new theory.\r\n\r\nThere are cases, however, where the facts seem clearly to contradict the\r\nold theory and thus give rise to a new one. For example, we find in\r\nDarwin's introduction to his _Origin of Species_ the following: \"In\r\nconsidering the origin of species it is quite conceivable that a\r\nnaturalist reflecting on the mental affinities of organic beings, on\r\ntheir embryological relations, their geographical distribution,\r\ngeological succession, and other such facts, might come to the\r\nconclusion that species had not been independently created but had\r\ndescended, like varieties, from other species.\" It would seem from this\r\nstatement that certain data were found for which the older theory of\r\nindependent creation did not offer an adequate explanation. And yet the\r\nnaturalist would hardly \"reflect\" on all these topics in a comparative\r\nway unless some other mode of interpretation were already dawning upon\r\nhim, which led him to review the accepted reflections or views.\r\n\r\nAs a more simple illustration, we may cite the common experience of a\r\nperson who is uncertain concerning the identity of an approaching\r\nobject, say, another person. At first he may not be sure it is a person\r\nat all. He then sees that it is someone, and as the person approaches he\r\nis inclined to believe him to be an acquaintance. As the supposed\r\nacquaintance continues to approach, the observer may distinguish certain\r\nfeatures that cause him to doubt, and then relinquish his supposition\r\nthat it is an acquaintance. Or, he may conclude at once that the\r\napproaching person is another individual he knows, and the transition\r\nmay be so readily made from one to the other that it would be difficult\r\nto determine whether the discordant features are discordant before the\r\nnew supposition arises, or whether they are not recognized as\r\nconflicting till this second person is in mind. Or, again, the\r\nidentification of the new individual and the discovery of the features\r\nthat are in conflict with the first supposition may appear to go on\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nNow, marked lines of likeness appear between this relatively simple\r\njudgment and the far more involved ones of scientific research. In the\r\nmore extended scientific process we find data contradicting an old\r\ntheory and a new hypothesis arising to account for them. The hypothesis\r\nis tested, and along with its verification we have the rejection, or\r\nrather the modification, of the old theory. Similarly, in case of the\r\napproaching stranger all these features are present, though in less\r\npronounced degree. In scientific investigation there is an interval of\r\ntesting by means of more careful consideration of the data and even\r\nactual experimentation. Before an explanation is accepted subject to\r\ntest, a number of others may have been suggested and rejected. They may\r\nnot have received even explicit recognition. In case of the\r\nidentification of the stranger this feature is also present. Between two\r\nfairly definite attempts to identify the mind does not remain a mere\r\nblank or stationary, but other possible identifications may be suggested\r\nwhich do not have sufficient plausibility to command serious attention;\r\nthey are only comparatively brief suggestions or tendencies.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that in all these instances the first supposition was\r\nnot _entirely_ abandoned, but was modified and more exactly determined.\r\n(Why it could not be wholly false and the new one wholly new, will be\r\nconsidered later in connection with discussion of the persistence and\r\nre-formation of habit.) There was such a modification of the old theory\r\nas would meet the requirements of the new data, and the new explanations\r\nthus contained both old and new features.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the predicate of the scientific judgment is a\r\nhypothesis which is consciously applied to certain data. If the\r\nsimilarity between the scientific judgment and the more immediate and\r\nsimple judgment is to be maintained, it is clear that the predicate of\r\nthe simple judgment must be of like nature. The structure of the two\r\nvarieties of judgment differs only in the degree of explicitness which\r\nthe hypothesis acquires. That is, the predicate of a judgment, as such,\r\nis ideal; it is meaning, significant quality. If conditions are such as\r\nto make the one judging hesitant or doubtful the mind wavers; the\r\npredicate is not applied at once to the determination or qualification\r\nof data, and hence comes to more distinct consciousness on its own\r\naccount. From being \"ideal,\" it becomes _an_ idea. Yet its sole purpose\r\nand value remains in its possible use to interpret data. Let the idea\r\nremain detached, and let the query whether it be a true predicate\r\n(_i. e_., really fit to be employed in determining the present data)\r\nbecome more critical, and the idea becomes clearly a hypothesis.[57] In\r\nother words, the hypothesis is just the predicate-function of judgment\r\ndefinitely apprehended and regarded with reference to its nature and\r\nadequacy.\r\n\r\n_Psychological analysis of judgment._--This hypothetical nature of the\r\npredicate will be even more apparent after a further psychological\r\nanalysis, which, while applying more directly to the simpler and more\r\nimmediate judgments, may be extended to the more involved ones as well.\r\n\r\nIn psychological terms, we may say, in explanation of the judging\r\nprocess, that some stimulus to action has failed to function properly as\r\na stimulus, and that the activity which was going on has thus been\r\ninterrupted. Response in the accustomed way has failed. In such a case\r\nthere arises a division in experience into sensation content as subject\r\nand ideal content as predicate. In other words, an activity has been\r\ngoing on in accordance with established habits, but upon failure of the\r\naccustomed stimulus to be longer an adequate stimulus this particular\r\nactivity ceases, and is resumed in an integral form only when a new\r\nhabit is set up to which the new or altered stimulus is adequate. It is\r\nin this process of reconstruction that subject and predicate appear.\r\nSensory quality marks the point of stress, or seeming arrest, while the\r\nideal or imaged aspect defines the continuing activity as projected, and\r\nhence that with which start is to be made in coping with the obstacle.\r\nIt serves as standpoint of regard and mode of indicated behavior. The\r\nsensation stands for the interrupted habit, while the image stands for\r\nthe new habit, that is, the new way of dealing with the\r\nsubject-matter.[58]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the purpose of the judgment is to obtain an\r\nadequate stimulus in that, when stimulus and response are adjusted to\r\neach other, activity will be resumed. But if this reconstruction and\r\nresponse were to follow at once, would there be any clearly defined act\r\nof judging at all? In such a case there would be no judgment, properly\r\nspeaking, and no occasion for it. There would be simply a ready\r\ntransition from one line of activity to another; we should have changed\r\nour method of reaction easily and readily to meet the new requirements.\r\nOn the one hand, our subject-matter would not have become a clearly\r\nrecognized datum with which we must deal; on the other hand, there would\r\nbe no ideal method of construing it.[59] Activity would have changed\r\nwithout interruption, and neither subject nor predicate would have\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nIn order that judgment may take place there must be interruption and\r\nsuspense. Under what conditions, then, is this suspense and uncertainty\r\npossible? Our reply must be that we hesitate because of more or less\r\nsharply defined alternatives; we are not sure which predicate, which\r\nmethod of reaction, is the right one. The clearness with which these\r\nalternatives come to mind depends upon the degree of explicitness of the\r\njudgment, or, more exactly, the explicitness of the judgment depends\r\nupon the sharpness of these alternatives. Alternatives may be carefully\r\nweighed one against the other, as in deliberative judgments; or they may\r\nbe scarcely recognized as alternatives, as in the case in the greater\r\nportion of our more simple judgments of daily conduct.\r\n\r\n_The predicate is essentially hypothetical._--If we review in a brief\r\nrésumé the types of judgment we have considered, we find in the explicit\r\nscientific judgment a fairly well-defined subject-matter which we seek\r\nfurther to determine. Different suggestions present themselves with\r\nvarying degrees of plausibility. Some are passed by as soon as they\r\narise. Others gain a temporary recognition. Some are explicitly tested\r\nwith resulting acceptance or rejection. The acceptance of any one\r\nexplanation involves the rejection of some other explanation. During the\r\nprocess of verification or test the newly advanced supposition is\r\nrecognized to be more or less doubtful. Besides the hypothesis which is\r\ntentatively applied there is recognized the possibility of others. In\r\nthe disjunctive judgment these possible reactions are thought to be\r\nlimited to certain clearly defined alternatives, while in the less\r\nexplicit judgments they are not so clearly brought out. Throughout the\r\nvarious forms of judgment, from the most complex and deliberate down to\r\nthe most simple and immediate, we found that a process could be traced\r\nwhich was like in kind and varied only in degree. And, finally, in the\r\nmost immediate judgments where some of these features seem to disappear,\r\nthe same account not only appears to be the most reasonable one, but\r\nthere is the additional consideration, from the psychological side, that\r\nwere not the judgment of this doubtful, tentative character, it would be\r\ndifficult to understand how there could be judgment as distinct from a\r\nreflex. It appears, then, that throughout, the predicate is essentially\r\nof the nature of a hypothesis for dealing with the subject-matter. And,\r\nhowever simple and immediate, or however involved and prolonged, the\r\njudgment may be, it is to be regarded as essentially a process of\r\nreconstruction which aims at the resumption of an interrupted\r\nexperience; and when experience has become itself a consciously\r\nintellectual affair, at the restoration of a unified objective\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_Criticism of certain views concerning the hypothesis._--The explanation\r\nwe have given of the hypothesis will enable us to criticise the\r\ntreatment it has received from the empirical and the rationalistic\r\nschools. We shall endeavor to point out that these schools have, in\r\nspite of their opposed views, an assumption in common--something given\r\nin a fixed, or non-instrumental way; and that consequently the\r\nhypothesis is either impossible or else futile.\r\n\r\nBacon is commonly recognized as a leader in the reactionary inductive\r\nmovement, which arose with the decline of scholasticism, and will serve\r\nas a good example of the extreme empirical position. In place of\r\nauthority and the deductive method, Bacon advocated a return to nature\r\nand induction from data given through observation. The new method which\r\nhe advanced has both a positive and a negative side. Before any\r\npositive steps can be taken, the mind must be cleared of the various\r\nfalse opinions and prejudices that have been acquired. This preliminary\r\ntask of freeing the mind from \"phantoms,\" or \"eidola,\" which Bacon\r\nlikened to the cleansing of the threshing-floor, having been\r\naccomplished, nature should be carefully interrogated. There must be no\r\nhasty generalization, for the true method \"collects axioms from sense\r\nand particulars, ascending continuously and by degrees, so that in the\r\nend it arrives at the most general axioms.\" These axioms of Bacon's are\r\ngeneralizations based on observation, and are to be applied deductively,\r\nbut the distinguishing feature of Bacon's induction is its carefully\r\ngraduated steps. Others, too, had proceeded with caution (for instance\r\nGalileo), but Bacon laid more stress than they on the subordination of\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Bacon left very little room for hypotheses, and this\r\nis in keeping with his aversion to anticipation of nature by means of\r\n\"phantoms\" of any sort; he even said explicitly that \"our method of\r\ndiscovery in science is of such a nature that there is not much left to\r\nacuteness and strength of genius, but all degrees of genius and\r\nintellect are brought nearly to the same level.\"[60] Bacon gave no\r\nexplanation of the function of the hypothesis; in his opinion it had no\r\nlawful place in scientific procedure and must be banished as a\r\ndisturbing element. Instead of the reciprocal relation between\r\nhypothesis and data, in which hypothesis is not only tested in\r\nexperience, but at the same time controls in a measure the very\r\nexperience which tests it, Bacon would have a gradual extraction of\r\ngeneral laws from nature through direct observation. He is so afraid of\r\nthe distorting influence of conception that he will have nothing to do\r\nwith conception upon any terms. So fearful is he of the influence of\r\npre-judgment, of prejudice, that he will have no judging which depends\r\nupon ideas, since the idea involves anticipation of the fact.\r\nParticulars are somehow to arrange and classify themselves, and to\r\nrecord or register, in a mind free from conception, certain\r\ngeneralizations. Ideas are to be registered derivatives of the given\r\nparticulars. This view is the essence of empiricism as a logical theory.\r\nIf the views regarding the logic of thought before set forth are\r\ncorrect, it goes without saying that such empiricism is condemned to\r\nself-contradiction. It endeavors to construct judgment in terms of its\r\nsubject alone; and the subject, as we have seen, is always a\r\nco-respondent to a predicate--an idea or mental attitude or tendency of\r\nintellectual determination. Thus the subject of judgment can be\r\ndetermined only with reference to a corresponding determination of the\r\npredicate. Subject and predicate, fact and idea, are contemporaneous,\r\nnot serial in their relations (see pp. 110-12).\r\n\r\nLess technically the failure of Bacon's denial of the worth of\r\nhypothesis--which is in such exact accord with empiricism in\r\nlogic--shows itself in his attitude toward experimentation and toward\r\nobservation. Bacon's neglect of experimentation is not an accidental\r\noversight, but is bound up with his view regarding the worthlessness of\r\nconception or anticipation. To experiment means to set out from an idea\r\nas well as from facts, and to try to construe, or even to discover,\r\nfacts in accordance with the idea. Experimentation not only anticipates,\r\nbut strives to make good an anticipation. Of course, this struggle is\r\nchecked at every point by success or failure, and thus the hypothesis is\r\ncontinuously undergoing in varying ratios both confirmation and\r\ntransformation. But this is not to make the hypothesis secondary to the\r\nfact. It is simply to remain true to the proposition that the\r\ndistinction and the relationship of the two is a thoroughly\r\ncontemporaneous one. But it is impossible to draw any fixed line between\r\nexperimentation and scientific observations. To insist upon the need of\r\nsystematic observation and collection of particulars is to set up a\r\nprinciple which is as distinct from the casual accumulation of\r\nimpressions as it is from nebulous speculation. If there is to be\r\nobservation of a directed sort, it must be with reference to some\r\nproblem, some doubt, and this, as we have seen, is a stimulus which\r\nthrows the mind into a certain attitude of response. Controlled\r\nobservation is inquiry, it is search; consequently it must be search for\r\nsomething. Nature cannot answer interrogations excepting as such\r\ninterrogations are put; and the putting of a question involves\r\nanticipation. The observer does not inquire about anything or look for\r\nanything excepting as he is after something. This search implies at once\r\nthe incompleteness of the particular given facts, and the\r\npossibility--that is ideal--of their completion.\r\n\r\nIt was not long until the development of natural science compelled a\r\nbetter understanding of its actual procedure than Bacon possessed.\r\nEmpiricism changed to experimentalism. With experimentalism inevitably\r\ncame the recognition of hypotheses in observing, collecting, and\r\ncomparing facts. It is clear, for instance, that Newton's fruitful\r\ninvestigations are not conducted in accordance with the Baconian notion.\r\nIt is quite clear that his celebrated four rules for philosophizing[61]\r\nare in truth statements of certain principles which are to be observed\r\nin forming hypotheses. They imply that scientific technique had advanced\r\nto a point where hypotheses were such regular and indispensable factors\r\nthat certain uniform conditions might be laid down for their use. The\r\nfourth rule in particular is a statement of the relative validity of\r\nhypothesis as such until there is ground for entertaining a contrary\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of logical theory in England is conditioned upon\r\nits attempt to combine into one system the theories of empiristic logic\r\nwith recognition of the procedure of experimental science. This attempt\r\nfinds its culmination in the logic of John Stuart Mill. Of his interest\r\nin and fidelity to the actual procedure of experimental science, as he\r\nsaw it, there can be no doubt. Of his good faith in concluding his\r\n_Introduction_ with the words following there can be no doubt: \"I can\r\nconscientiously affirm that no one proposition laid down in this work\r\nhas been adopted for the sake of establishing, or with any reference for\r\nits fitness in being employed in establishing, preconceived opinions in\r\nany department of knowledge or of inquiry on which the speculative world\r\nis still undecided.\" Yet Mill was equally attached to the belief that\r\nultimate reality, as it is for the human mind, is given in sensations,\r\nindependent of ideas; and that all valid ideas are combinations and\r\nconvenient ways of using such given material. Mill's very sincerity made\r\nit impossible that this belief should not determine, at every point, his\r\ntreatment of the thinking process and of its various instrumentalities.\r\n\r\nIn Book III, chap. 14, Mill discusses the logic of explanation, and in\r\ndiscussing this topic naturally finds it necessary to consider the\r\nmatter of the proper use of scientific hypotheses. This is conducted\r\nfrom the standpoint of their use as that is reflected in the technique\r\nof scientific discovery. In Book IV, chap. 2, he discusses \"Abstraction\r\nor the Formation of Conceptions\"--a topic which obviously involves the\r\nforming of hypotheses. In this chapter, his consideration is conducted\r\nin terms, not of scientific procedure, but of general philosophical\r\ntheory, and this point of view is emphasized by the fact that he is\r\nopposing a certain view of Dr. Whewell.\r\n\r\nThe contradiction between the statements in the two chapters will serve\r\nto bring out the two points already made, viz., the correspondent\r\ncharacter of datum and hypothesis, and the origin of the latter in a\r\nproblematic situation and its consequent use as an instrument of\r\nunification and solution. Mill first points out that hypotheses are\r\ninvented to enable the deductive method to be applied earlier to\r\nphenomena; that it does this by suppressing the first of the three\r\nsteps, induction, ratiocination, and verification. He states that:\r\n\r\n    The process of tracing regularity in any complicated, and at first\r\n    sight confused, set of appearances is necessarily tentative; we\r\n    begin by making any supposition, even a false one, to see what\r\n    consequences will follow from it; and by observing how these\r\n    differ from the real phenomena, we learn what corrections to make\r\n    in our assumption.... _Neither induction nor deduction would\r\n    enable us to understand even the simplest phenomena_, if we did\r\n    not often commence by anticipating the results; by making a\r\n    provisional supposition, at first essentially conjectural, as to\r\n    some of the very notions which constitute the final object of the\r\n    inquiry.[62]\r\n\r\nIf in addition we recognize that, according to Mill, our direct\r\nexperience of nature always presents us with a complicated and confused\r\nset of appearances, we shall be in no doubt as to the importance of\r\nideas as anticipations of a possible experience not yet had. Thus he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    The order of nature, as perceived at a first glance, presents at\r\n    every instant a chaos followed by another chaos. We must decompose\r\n    each chaos into single facts. We must learn to see in the chaotic\r\n    antecedent a multitude of distinct antecedents, in the chaotic\r\n    consequent a multitude of distinct consequents.[63]\r\n\r\nIn the next section of the same chapter he goes on to state that, having\r\ndiscriminated the various antecedents and consequents, we then \"are to\r\ninquire which is connected with which.\" This requires a still further\r\nresolution of the complex and of the confused. To effect this we must\r\nvary the circumstances; we must modify the experience as given with\r\nreference to accomplishing our purpose. To accomplish this purpose we\r\nhave recourse either to observation or to experiment: \"We may either\r\n_find_ an instance in nature _suited to our purposes_, or, by an\r\nartificial arrangement of circumstances, _make_ one\" (the italics in\r\n\"suited to our purpose\" are mine; the others are Mill's). He then goes\r\non to say that there is no real logical distinction between observation\r\nand experimentation. The four methods of experimental inquiry are\r\nexpressly discussed by Mill in terms of their worth in singling out and\r\nconnecting the antecedents and consequents which actually belong\r\ntogether, from the chaos and confusion of direct experience.\r\n\r\nWe have only to take these statements in their logical connection with\r\neach other (and this connection runs through the entire treatment by\r\nMill of scientific inquiry), to recognize the absolute necessity of\r\nhypothesis to undertaking any directed inquiry or scientific operation.\r\nConsequently we are not surprised at finding him saying that \"the\r\nfunction of hypotheses is one which must be reckoned absolutely\r\nindispensable in science;\" and again that \"the hypothesis by suggesting\r\nobservations and experiments puts us on the road to independent\r\nevidence.\"[64]\r\n\r\nSince Mill's virtual retraction, from the theoretical point of view, of\r\nwhat is here said from the standpoint of scientific procedure, regarding\r\nthe necessity of ideas is an accompaniment of his criticism of Whewell,\r\nit will put the discussion in better perspective if we turn first to\r\nWhewell's views.[65] The latter began by stating a distinction which\r\neasily might have been developed into a theory of the relation of fact\r\nand idea which is in line with that advanced in this chapter, and indeed\r\nin this volume as a whole. He questions (chap. 2) the fixity of the\r\ndistinction between theory and practice. He points out that what we term\r\nfacts are in effect simply accepted inferences; and that what we call\r\ntheories are describable as facts, in proportion as they become\r\nthoroughly established. A true theory is a fact. \"All the great theories\r\nwhich have successively been established in the world are now thought of\r\nas facts.\" \"The most recondite theories when firmly established are\r\naccepted as facts; the simplest facts seem to involve something of the\r\nnature of theory.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that the distinction is a historic one, depending upon\r\nthe state of knowledge at the time, and upon the attitude of the\r\nindividual. What is theory for one epoch, or for one inquirer in a given\r\nepoch, is fact for some other epoch, or even for some other more\r\nadvanced inquirer in the same epoch. It is theory when the element of\r\ninference involved in judging any fact is consciously brought out; it is\r\nfact when the conditions are such that we have never been led to\r\nquestion the inference involved, or else, having questioned it, have so\r\nthoroughly examined into the inferential process that there is no need\r\nof holding it further before the mind, and it relapses into\r\nunconsciousness again. \"If this greater or less consciousness of our own\r\ninternal act be all that distinguishes fact from theory, we must allow\r\nthat the distinction is still untenable\" (untenable, that is to say, as\r\na fixed separation). Again, \"fact and theory have no essential\r\ndifference except in the degree of their _certainty and familiarity_.\r\nTheory, when it becomes firmly established and steadily lodged in the\r\nmind becomes fact.\" (P. 45; italics mine.) And, of course, it is equally\r\ntrue that as fast as facts are suspected or doubted, certain aspects of\r\nthem are transferred into the class of theories and even of mere\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nI say this conception might have been developed in a way entirely\r\ncongruous with the position of this chapter. This would have happened if\r\nthe final distinction between fact and idea had been formulated upon the\r\nbasis simply of the points, \"relative certainty and familiarity.\" From\r\nthis point of view the distinction between fact and idea is one purely\r\nrelative to the doubt-inquiry function. It has to do with the evolution\r\nof an experience as regards its conscious surety. It has its origin in\r\nproblematic situations. Whatever appears to us as a problem appears as\r\ncontrasted with a possible solution. Whatever objects of thought refer\r\nparticularly to the problematic side are theories, ideas, hypotheses;\r\nwhatever relates to the solution side is surety, unquestioned\r\nfamiliarity, fact. This point of view makes the distinctions entirely\r\nrelative to the exigencies of the process of reflective transformation\r\nof experience.\r\n\r\nWhewell, however, had no sooner started in this train of thought than he\r\nturns his back upon it. In chap. 3 he transforms what he had proclaimed\r\nto be a relative, historic, and working distinction into a fixed and\r\nabsolute one. He distinguishes between sensations and ideas, not upon a\r\ngenetic basis with reference to establishing the conditions of further\r\noperation; but with reference to a fundamentally fixed line of\r\ndemarkation between what is passively _given_ to the mind and the\r\n_activity_ put forth by the mind. Thus he reinstates in its most\r\ngeneralized and fixed, and therefore most vicious, form the separation\r\nwhich he has just rejected. Sensations are a brute unchangeable element\r\nof fact which exists and persists independent of ideas; an idea is a\r\nmode of mental operation which occurs and recurs in an independent\r\nindividuality of its own. If he had carried out the line of thought with\r\nwhich he began, sensation as fact would have been that residuum of\r\nfamiliarity and certainty which cannot be eliminated, however much else\r\nof an experience is dissolved in the inner conflict. Idea as hypothesis\r\nor theory would have been the corresponding element in experience which\r\nis necessary to redintegrate this residuum into a coherent and\r\nsignificant experience.\r\n\r\nBut since Whewell did not follow out his own line of thought, choosing\r\nrather to fall back on the Kantian antithesis of sense and thought, he\r\nhad no sooner separated his fact and idea, his given datum and his\r\nmental relation, than he is compelled to get them together again. The\r\nidea becomes \"a general relation which is imposed upon perception by an\r\nact of the mind, and which is different from anything which our senses\r\ndirectly offer to us\" (p. 26). Such conceptions are necessary to connect\r\nthe facts which we learn from our senses into truths. \"The ideal\r\nconception which the mind itself supplies is superinduced upon the facts\r\nas they are originally presented to observation. Before the inductive\r\ntruth is detected, the facts are there, but they are many and\r\nunconnected. The conception which the discoverer applies to them gives\r\nthem connection and unity.\" (P. 42.) All induction, according to\r\nWhewell, thus depends upon superinduction--imposition upon sensory data\r\nof certain ideas or general relations existing independently in the\r\nmind.[66]\r\n\r\nWe do not need to present again the objections already offered to this\r\nview: the impossibility of any orderly stimulation of ideas by facts,\r\nand the impossibility of any check in the imposition of idea upon fact.\r\n\"Facts\" and conception are so thoroughly separate and independent that\r\nany sensory datum is indifferently and equally related to any\r\nconceivable idea. There is no basis for \"superinducing\" one idea or\r\nhypothesis, rather than any other, upon any particular set of data.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter already referred to upon abstraction, or the formation of\r\nconceptions, Mill seizes upon this difficulty. Yet he and Whewell have\r\none point in common: they both agree in the existence of a certain\r\nsubject-matter which is given for logical purposes quite outside of the\r\nlogical process itself. Mill agrees with Whewell in postulating a raw\r\nmaterial of pure sensational data. In criticising Whewell's theory of\r\nsuperinduction of idea upon fact, he is therefore led to the opposite\r\nassertion of the complete dependence of ideas as such upon the given\r\nfacts as such--in other words, he is led to a reiteration of the\r\nfundamental Baconian empiricism; and thus to a virtual retraction of\r\nwhat he had asserted regarding the necessity of ideas to fruitful\r\nscientific inquiry, whether in the way of observation or\r\nexperimentation. The following quotation gives a fair notion of the\r\nextent of Mill's retraction:\r\n\r\n    The conceptions then which we employ for the colligation and\r\n    methodization of facts, do not develop themselves from within,\r\n    _but are impressed upon the mind from without_; they are never\r\n    obtained otherwise than by way of comparison and abstraction, and,\r\n    in the most important and most numerous cases, are evolved by\r\n    abstraction _from the very phenomena which it is their office to\r\n    colligate_.[67]\r\n\r\nEven here Mill's sense for the positive side of scientific inquiry\r\nsuffices to reveal to him that the \"facts\" are somehow inadequate and\r\ndefective, and are in need of assistance from ideas--and yet the ideas\r\nwhich are to help out the facts are to be the impress of the unsure\r\nfacts! The contradiction comes out very clearly when Mill says: \"The\r\nreally difficult cases are those in which the conception destined to\r\ncreate light and order out of darkness and confusion has to be sought\r\nfor among the very phenomena which it afterward serves to arrange.\"[68]\r\n\r\nOf course, there is a sense in which Mill's view is very much nearer the\r\ntruth than is Whewell's. Mill at least sees that \"idea\" must be relevant\r\nto the facts or data which it is to arrange, which are to have \"light\r\nand order\" introduced into them by means of the idea. He sees clearly\r\nenough that this is impossible save as the idea develops _within_ the\r\nsame experience in which the \"dark and confused\" facts are presented. He\r\ngoes on to show correctly enough how conflicting data lead the mind to a\r\n\"confused feeling of an analogy\" between the data of the confused\r\nexperience and of some other experience which is orderly (or already\r\ncolligated and methodized); and how this vague feeling, through\r\nprocesses of further exploration and comparison of experiences, gets a\r\nclearer and more adequate form until we finally accept it. He shows how\r\nin this process we continually judge of the worth of the idea which is\r\nin process of formation, by reference to its appropriateness to _our\r\npurpose_. He goes so far as to say: \"The question of appropriateness is\r\nrelative to the _particular object we have in view_.\"[69] He sums up his\r\ndiscussion by stating: \"We cannot frame good general conceptions\r\nbeforehand. That the conception we have obtained is the one we want can\r\nonly be known when we have _done the work for the sake of which we\r\nwanted it_.\"[70]\r\n\r\nThis all describes the actual state of the case, but it is consistent\r\nonly with a logical theory which makes the distinction between fact and\r\nhypothesis instrumental in the transformation of experience from a\r\nconfused into an organized form; not with Mill's notion that sensations\r\nare somehow finally and completely given as ultimate facts, and that\r\nideas are mere re-registrations of such facts. It is perfectly just to\r\nsay that the hypothesis is impressed upon the mind (in the sense that\r\nany notion which occurs to the mind is impressed) _in the course_ of an\r\nexperience. It is well enough, if one define what he means, to say that\r\nthe hypothesis is impressed (that is to say, occurs or is suggested)\r\nthrough the medium of given facts, or even of sensations. But it is\r\nequally true that the _facts_ are presented and that _sensations_ occur\r\nwithin the course of an experience which is larger than the bare facts,\r\nbecause involving the conflicts among them and the corresponding\r\nintention to treat them in some fashion which will secure a unified\r\nexperience. Facts get power to suggest ideas to the mind--to\r\n\"impress\"--only through their position in an entire experience which is\r\nin process of disintegration and of reconstruction--their \"fringe\" or\r\nfeeling of tendency is quite as factual as they are. The fact that \"the\r\nconception we have obtained is the one we want can be known only when we\r\nhave done the work for the sake of which we wanted it,\" is enough to\r\nshow that it is not bare facts, but facts in relation to want and\r\npurpose and purpose in relation to facts, which originate the\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to follow the history of discussion of the\r\nhypothesis since the time of Whewell and of Mill, particularly in the\r\nwritings of Jevons, Venn, and Bosanquet. This history would refine the\r\nterms of our discussion by introducing more complex distinctions and\r\nrelations. But it would be found, I think, only to refine, not to\r\nintroduce any fundamentally new principles. In each case, we find the\r\nwriter struggling with the necessity of distinguishing between fact and\r\nidea; of giving the fact a certain primacy with respect to testing of\r\nidea and of giving the idea a primacy with respect to the significance\r\nand orderliness of the fact; and of holding throughout to a relationship\r\nof idea with fact so intimate that the idea develops only by being\r\n\"compared\" with facts (that is, used in construing them), and facts get\r\nto be known only as they are \"connected\" through the idea--and we find\r\nthat what is a maze of paradoxes and inconsistencies from an absolute,\r\nfrom a non-historic standpoint, is a matter of course the moment\r\nit is looked at from the standpoint of experience engaged in\r\nself-transformation of meaning through conflict and reconstitution.\r\n\r\nBut we can only note one or two points. Jevons's \"infinite ballot-box\"\r\nof nature which is absolutely neutral as to any particular conception or\r\nidea, and which accordingly requires as its correlate the formation of\r\nevery possible hypothesis (all standing in themselves upon the same\r\nlevel of probability) is an interesting example of the logical\r\nconsequences of feeling the need of both fact and hypothesis for\r\nscientific procedure and yet regarding them as somehow arising\r\nindependently of each other. It is an attempt to combine extreme\r\nempiricism and extreme rationalism. The process of forming hypotheses\r\nand of deducing their rational consequences goes on at random, because\r\nthe disconnectedness of facts as given is so ultimate that the facts\r\nsuggest one hypothesis no more readily than another. Mathematics, in its\r\ntwo forms of measurements as applied to the facts, and of calculation as\r\napplied in deduction, furnishes Jevons the bridge by which he finally\r\ncovers the gulf which he has first himself created. Venn's theory\r\nrequires little or no restatement to bring it into line with the\r\nposition taken in the text. He holds to the origin of hypothesis in the\r\noriginal practical needs of mankind, and to its gradual development into\r\npresent scientific form.[71] He states expressly:\r\n\r\n    The _distinction between what is known and what is not known is\r\n    essential to Logic_, and peculiarly characteristic of it in a\r\n    degree not to be found in any other science. Inference is the\r\n    process of passing from one to the other; from facts which we had\r\n    accepted as premises, to those which we have not yet accepted,\r\n    _but are in the act of doing so by the very process in question_.\r\n    No scrutiny of the facts themselves, regarded as objective, can\r\n    ever detect these characteristics of their greater or less\r\n    familiarity to our minds. We must introduce also the subjective\r\n    element if we wish to give any adequate explanation of them.[72]\r\n\r\nVenn, however, does not attempt a thoroughgoing statement of logical\r\ndistinctions, relations, and operations, as parts \"of the act of passing\r\nfrom the unknown to the known.\" He recognizes the relation of reflection\r\nto a historic process, which we have here termed \"reconstruction,\" and\r\nthe origin and worth of hypothesis as a tool in the movement, but does\r\nnot carry his analysis to a systematic form.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n_Origin of the hypothesis._--In our analysis of the process of judgment,\r\nwe attempted to show that the predicate arises in case of failure of\r\nsome line of activity going on in terms of an established habit. When\r\nthe old habit is checked through failure to deal with new conditions\r\n(_i. e._, when the situation is such as to stimulate two habits with\r\ndistinct aims) the problem is to find a new method of response--that is,\r\nto co-ordinate the conflicting tendencies by building up a single aim\r\nwhich will function the existing situation. As we saw that, in case of\r\njudgment, habit when checked became ideal, an idea, so the new habit is\r\nfirst formalized as an ideal type of reaction and is the hypothesis by\r\nwhich we attempt to construe new data. In our inquiry as to how this\r\nformulation is effected, _i. e._, how the hypothesis is developed, it\r\nwill be convenient to take some of the currently accepted statements as\r\nto their origin, and show how these statements stand in reference to the\r\nanalysis proposed.\r\n\r\n_Enumerative induction and allied processes._--It is pointed out by\r\nWelton[73] that the various ways in which hypotheses are suggested may\r\nbe reduced to three classes, viz., enumerative induction, conversion of\r\npropositions, and analogy. Under the head of \"enumeration\" he reminds us\r\nthat \"every observed regularity of connection between phenomena suggests\r\na question as to whether it is universal.\" There are numerous instances\r\nof this in mathematics. For example, it is noticed that 1+3=2^2,\r\n1+3+5=3^2, 1+3+5+7=4^2, etc.; and one is led to ask whether there is any\r\ngeneral principle involved, so that the sum of the first _n_ odd numbers\r\nwill be _n_^2, where _n_ is any number, however great. In this early\r\nform of inductive inference there are two divergent tendencies. One is\r\nthe tendency to complete enumeration. This _tendency_ is clearly\r\nideal--it transcends the facts as given. To look for all the cases is\r\nthus itself an experimental inquiry, based upon a hypothesis which it\r\nendeavors to test. But in most cases enumeration can be only incomplete,\r\nand we are able to reach nothing better than probability. Hence the\r\nother tendency in the direction of an analysis of content in search for\r\na principle of connection in the elements in any _one_ case. For if a\r\ncharacteristic belonging to a number of individuals suggests a class\r\nwhere it belongs to all individuals, it must be that it is found in\r\nevery individual as such. The hypothesis of complete class involves a\r\nhypothesis as to the character of each individual in the class. Thus a\r\nhypothesis as to extension transforms itself into one as to intension.\r\n\r\nBut it is analogy which Welton considers \"the chief source from which\r\nnew hypotheses are drawn.\" In the second tendency mentioned under\r\nenumerative induction, that is, the tendency to analysis of content or\r\nintension, we are naturally led to analogy, for in our search for the\r\ncharacteristic feature which determines classification among the\r\nconcrete particulars our first step will be an inference by analogy. In\r\nanalogy attention is turned from the number of observed instances to\r\ntheir character, and, because particulars have some feature in common,\r\nthey are supposed to be the same in still other respects. While the best\r\nwe can reach in analogy is probability, the arguments may be such as to\r\nresult in a high degree of certainty. The form of the argument is\r\nvaluable in so far as we are able to distinguish between essential and\r\nnonessential characteristics on which to base our analogy. What is\r\nessential and what nonessential depends upon the particular end we have\r\nin view.\r\n\r\nIn addition to enumerative induction, which Welton has mentioned, it is\r\nto be noted that there are a number of other processes which are very\r\nsimilar to it in that a number of particulars appear to furnish a basis\r\nfor a general principle or method. Such instances are common in\r\ninduction, in instruction, and in methods of proof.\r\n\r\nIf one is to be instructed in some new kind of labor, he is supposed to\r\nacquire a grasp of the method after having been shown in a few instances\r\nhow this particular work is to be done; and, if he performs the\r\nmanipulations himself, so much the better. It is not asked why the\r\nexperience of a few cases should be of any assistance, for it seems\r\nself-evident that an experienced man, a man who has acquired the skill,\r\nor knack, of doing things, should deal better with all other cases of\r\nsimilar nature.\r\n\r\nThere is something very similar in inductive proofs, as they are called.\r\nThe inductive proof is common in algebra. Suppose we are concerned in\r\nproving the law of expansion of the binomial theorem. We show by actual\r\ncalculation that, if the law holds good for the _n_th power, it is true\r\nfor the _n_+first power. That is, if it holds for any power, it holds\r\nfor the next also. But we can easily show that it does hold for, say,\r\nthe second power. Then it must be true for the third, and hence for the\r\nfourth, and so on. Whether this law, though discovered by inductive\r\nprocesses, depends on deduction for the conclusiveness of its proof, as\r\nJevons holds;[74] whether, as Erdmann[75] contends, the proof is\r\nthoroughly deductive; or whether Wundt[76] is right in maintaining that\r\nit is based on an exact analogy, while the fundamental axioms of\r\nmathematics are inductive, it is clear that in such proofs a few\r\ninstances are employed to give the learner a start in the right\r\ndirection. Something suggests itself, and is found true in this case, in\r\nthe next, and again in the next, and so on. It may be questioned whether\r\nthere is usually a very clear notion of what is involved in the \"so on.\"\r\nTo many it appears to mark the point where, after having been taken a\r\nfew steps, the learner is carried on by the acquired momentum somewhat\r\nafter the fashion of one of Newton's laws of motion. Whether the few\r\nsuccessive steps are an integral part of the proof or merely serve as\r\nillustration, they are very generally resorted to. In fact, they are\r\noften employed where there is no attempt to introduce a general term\r\nsuch as _n_, or _k_, or _l_, but the few individual instances are deemed\r\nquite sufficient. Such, for instance, is the custom in arithmetical\r\nprocesses. We call attention to these facts in order to show that\r\nsuccessive cases are utilized in the course of explanation as an aid in\r\nestablishing the generality of a law.\r\n\r\nIn geometry we find a class of proofs in which the successive steps seem\r\nto have great significance. A common proof of the area of the circle\r\nwill serve as a fair example. A regular polygon is circumscribed about\r\nthe circle. Then as the number of its sides are increased its area will\r\napproach that of the circle, as its perimeter approaches the\r\ncircumference of the circle. The area of the circle is thus inferred to\r\nbe [pi]_R_^2, since the area of the polygon is always (1/2)_R_×\r\nperimeter, and in case of the circle the circumference = 2[pi]_R_.\r\nHere again we get under such headway by means of the polygon that we\r\narrive at the circle with but little difficulty. Had we attempted the\r\ntransition at once, say, from a circumscribed square, we should\r\ndoubtless have experienced some uncertainty and might have recoiled from\r\nwhat would seem a rash attempt; but as the number of the sides of our\r\npolygon approach infinity--that mysterious realm where many paradoxical\r\nthings become possible--the transition becomes so easy that our polygon\r\nis often said to have truly become a circle.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, some statements of the infinitesimal calculus rest on the\r\nassumption that slight degrees of difference may be neglected. Though\r\nthe more modern theory of limits has largely displaced this attitude in\r\ncalculus and has also changed the method of proof in such geometrical\r\nproblems as the area of the circle, the underlying motive seems to have\r\nbeen to make transitions easy, and thus to make possible a continued\r\napplication of some particular method or way of dealing with things.\r\n\r\nBut granted that this is all true, what has it to do with the origin of\r\nthe hypothesis? It seems likely that the hypothesis may be suggested by\r\na few successive instances; but are these to be classed with the\r\nsuccessive steps in proof to which we have referred? In the first place,\r\nwe attempt to prove our hypothesis because we are not sure it is true;\r\nwe are not satisfied that there are no other tenable hypotheses. But if\r\nwe do test it, is not such test enough? It depends upon how thorough a\r\ngrasp we have of the situation; but, in general, each test case adds to\r\nits probability. The value of tests lies in the fact that they\r\nstrengthen and tend to confirm our hypothesis by checking the force of\r\nalternatives. One instance is not sufficient because there are other\r\npossible incipient hypotheses, or more properly tendencies, and the\r\nenumeration serves to bring one of these tendencies into prominence in\r\nthat it diminishes other vague and perhaps subconscious tendencies and\r\nstrengthens the one which suddenly appears as the mysterious product of\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThe question might arise why the mere repetition of conflicting\r\ntendencies would lead to a predominance of one of them. Why would they\r\nnot all remain in conflict and continue to check any positive result? It\r\nis probably because there never is any absolute equilibrium. The\r\nsuccessive instances tend to intensify and bring into prominence some\r\ntendency which is already taking a lead, so to speak. And it may be said\r\nfurther in this connection that only as seen from the outside, only as a\r\nmechanical view is taken, does there appear to be an excluding of\r\ndefinitely made out alternatives.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the part played by analogy in the origin of\r\nhypotheses, Welton points out that a mere number of instances do not\r\ntake us very far, and that there must be some \"_specification_ of the\r\ninstances as well as numbering of them,\" and goes on to show that the\r\nargument by enumerative induction passes readily into one from analogy,\r\nas soon as attention is turned from the number of the observed instances\r\nto their character. It is not necessary, however, to pass to analogy\r\nthrough enumerative induction. \"When the instances presented to\r\nobservation offer immediately the characteristic marks on which we base\r\nthe inference to the connection of S and P, we can proceed at once to an\r\ninference from analogy, without any preliminary enumeration of the\r\ninstances.\"[77]\r\n\r\nWelton, and logicians generally, regard analogy as an inference on the\r\nbasis of partial identity. Because of certain common features we are led\r\nto infer a still greater likeness.\r\n\r\nBoth enumerative induction and analogy are explicable in terms of habit.\r\nWe saw in our examination of enumerative induction that a form of\r\nreaction gains strength through a series of successful applications.\r\nAnalogy marks the presence of an identical element together with the\r\ntendency to extend this \"partial identity\" (as it is commonly called)\r\nstill farther. In other words, in analogy it is suggested that a type of\r\nreaction which is the same in certain respects may be made similar in a\r\ngreater degree. In enumerative induction we lay stress on the number of\r\ninstances in which the habit is applied. In analogy we emphasize the\r\ncontent side and take note of the partial identity. In fact, the\r\nrelation between enumerative induction and analogy is of the same sort\r\nas that existing between association by contiguity and association by\r\nsimilarity. In association by contiguity we think of the things\r\nassociated as merely standing in certain temporal or spatial relations,\r\nand disregard the fact that they were elements in a larger experience.\r\nIn case of association by similarity we regard the like feature in the\r\nthings associated as a basis for further correction.\r\n\r\nIn conversion of propositions we try to reverse the direction of the\r\nreaction, so to speak, and thereby to free the habit, to get a mode of\r\nresponse so generalized as to act with a minimum cue. For instance, we\r\ncan deal with A in a way called B, or, in other words, in the same way\r\nthat we did with other things called B. If we say, \"Man is an animal,\"\r\nthen to a certain extent the term \"animal\" signifies the way in which we\r\nregard \"man.\" But the question arises whether we can regard all animals\r\nas we do man. Evidently not, for the reaction which is fitting in case\r\nof animals would be only partially applicable to man. With the animals\r\nthat are also men we have the beginning of a habit which, if unchecked,\r\nwould lead to a similar reaction toward all animals, _i. e._, we would\r\nsay: \"All animals are men.\" Man may be said to be the richer concept, in\r\nthat only a part of the reaction which determines an object to be a man\r\nis required to designate it as an animal. On the other hand, if we start\r\nwith animal, then (except in case of the animals which are men) there is\r\nlacking the subject-matter which would permit the fuller concept to be\r\napplied. By supplying the conditions under which animal=man we get a\r\nreversible habit. The equation of technical science has just this\r\ncharacter. It represents the maximum freeing or abstraction of a\r\npredicate _qua_ predicate, and thereby multiplies the possible\r\napplications of it to subjects of future judgments, and lessens the\r\namount of shearing away of irrelevancies and of re-adaptation necessary\r\nwhen so used in any particular case.\r\n\r\n_Formation and test of the hypothesis._--The formation of the hypothesis\r\nis commonly regarded as essentially different from the process of\r\ntesting, which it subsequently undergoes. We are said to observe facts,\r\ninvent hypotheses, and _then_ test them. The hypothesis is not required\r\nfor our preliminary observations; and some writers, regarding the\r\nhypothesis as a formulation which requires a difficult and elaborate\r\ntest, decline to admit as hypotheses those more simple suppositions,\r\nwhich are readily confirmed or rejected. A very good illustration of\r\nthis point of view is met with in Wundt's discussion of the hypothesis,\r\nby an examination of which we hope to show that such distinctions are\r\nrather artificial than real.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter of science, says Wundt,[78] is constituted by that\r\nwhich is actually given and that which is actually to be expected. The\r\nwhole content is not limited to this, however, for these facts must be\r\nsupplemented by certain presuppositions, which are not given in a\r\nfactual sense. Such presuppositions are called hypotheses and are\r\njustified by our fundamental demand for unity. However valuable the\r\nhypothesis may be when rightly used, there is constant danger of\r\nillegitimately extending it by additions that spring from mere\r\ninclinations of fancy. Furthermore, the hypothesis in this proper\r\nscientific sense must be carefully distinguished from the various\r\ninaccurate uses, which are prevalent. For instance, hypotheses must not\r\nbe confused with expectations of fact. As cases in point Wundt mentions\r\nGalileo's suppositions that small vibrations of the pendulum are\r\nisochronous, and that the space traversed by a falling body is\r\nproportional to the square of the time it has been falling. It is true\r\nthat such anticipations play an important part in science, but so long\r\nas they relate to the facts themselves or to their connections, and can\r\nbe confirmed or rejected any moment through observation, they should not\r\nbe classed with those added presuppositions which are used to\r\nco-ordinate facts. Hence not all suppositions are hypotheses. On the\r\nother hand, not every hypothesis can be actually experienced. For\r\nexample, one employs in physics the hypothesis of electric fluid, but\r\ndoes not expect actually to meet with it. In many cases, however, the\r\nhypothesis becomes proved as an experienced fact. Such was the course of\r\nthe Copernican theory, which was at first only a hypothesis, but was\r\ntransformed into fact through the evidence afforded by subsequent\r\nastronomical observation.\r\n\r\nWundt defines a theory as a hypothesis taken together with the facts for\r\nwhose elucidation it was invented. In thus establishing a connection\r\nbetween the facts which the hypothesis merely suggested, the theory\r\nfurnishes at the same time partly the foundation (_Begründung_) and\r\npartly the confirmation (_Bestätigung_) of the hypothesis.[79] These\r\naspects, Wundt insists, must be sharply distinguished. Every hypothesis\r\nmust have its _Begründung_, but there can be _Bestätigung_ only in so\r\nfar as the hypothesis contains elements which are accessible to actual\r\nprocesses of verification. In most cases verification is attainable in\r\nonly certain elements of the hypothesis. For example, Newton was obliged\r\nto limit himself to one instance in the verification of his theory of\r\ngravitation, viz., the movements of the moon. The other heavenly bodies\r\nafforded nothing better than a foundation in that the supposition that\r\ngravity decreases as the square of the distance increases enabled him to\r\ndeduce the movements of the planets. The main object of his theory,\r\nhowever, lay in the deduction of these movements and not in the proof of\r\nuniversal gravity. With the Darwinian theory, on the contrary, the main\r\ninterest is in seeking its verification through examination of actual\r\ncases of development. Thus, while the Newtonian and the greater part of\r\nthe other physical theories lead to a deduction of the facts from the\r\nhypotheses, which can be verified only in individual instances, the\r\nDarwinian theory is concerned in evolving as far as possible the\r\nhypothesis out of the facts.\r\n\r\nLet us look more closely at Wundt's position. We will ask, first,\r\nwhether the distinction between hypotheses and expectations is as\r\npronounced as he maintains; and, second, whether the relation between\r\n_Begründung_ and _Bestätigung_ may not be closer than Wundt would have\r\nus believe.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the hypothesis Wundt mentions the Copernican hypothesis,\r\nNewton's hypothesis of gravitation, and the predictions of the\r\nastronomers which led to the discovery of Neptune. As examples of mere\r\nexpectations we are referred to Galileo's experiments with falling\r\nbodies and pendulums. In case of Newton's hypothesis there was the\r\nassumption of a general law, which was verified after much labor and\r\ndelay. The heliocentric hypothesis of Copernicus, which was invented for\r\nthe purpose of bringing system and unity into the movements of the\r\nplanets, has also been fairly well substantiated. In the discovery of\r\nNeptune we have, apparently, not the proof of a general law or the\r\ndiscovery of further peculiarities of previously known data, but rather\r\nthe discovery of a new object or agent by means of its observed effects.\r\nIn each of these instances we admit that the hypothesis was not readily\r\nsuggested or easily and directly tested.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to Galileo's pendulum and falling bodies, it is clear first\r\nof all that he did not have in mind the discovery of some object, as was\r\nthe case in the discovery of Neptune. Did he, then, either contribute to\r\nthe proof of a general law or discover further characteristics of things\r\nalready known in a more general way? Wundt tells us that Galileo only\r\ndetermined a little more exactly what he already knew, and that he did\r\nthis with but little labor or delay.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the real difference between hypothesis and expectation?\r\nIf we compare Galileo's determination of the law of falling bodies with\r\nNewton's test of his hypothesis of gravitation, we see that both\r\nexpectation and hypothesis were founded on observation and took the form\r\nof mathematical formulæ. Each tended to confirm the general law\r\nexpressed in its formula, though there was, of course, much difference\r\nin the time and labor required. If we compare the Copernican hypothesis\r\nwith Galileo's supposition concerning the pendulum, we find again that\r\nthey agree in regard to general purpose and method, and differ in the\r\ndifficulty of verification. If the experiment with the pendulum only\r\nsubstituted exactness for inexactness, did the Copernican theory do\r\nanything different in _kind_? It is true that the more exact statement\r\nof the swing of the pendulum was expressed in quantitative form, but\r\nquantitative statement is no criterion of either the presence or the\r\nabsence of the hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAgain, we may compare the pendulum with Kepler's laws. What was Kepler's\r\nhypothesis, that the square of the periodic times of the several planets\r\nare proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the sun,\r\nexcept a more exact formulation of facts which were already known in a\r\nmore general way? Wundt's position seems to be this: whenever a\r\nsupposition or suggestion can be tested readily, it should not be\r\nclassed as a hypothesis. This would make the distinction one of degree\r\nrather than kind, and it does not appear how much labor we must expend,\r\nor how long our supposition must evade our efforts to test it, before it\r\ncan win the title of hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we have seen that Wundt draws a sharp line between\r\n_Begründung_ and _Bestätigung_. It is doubtless true that every\r\nhypothesis requires a certain justification, for unless other facts can\r\nbe found which agree with deductions made in accordance with it, its\r\nonly support would be the data from which it is drawn. Such support as\r\nthis would be obtained through a process too clearly circular to be\r\nseriously entertained. The distinction which Wundt draws between\r\n_Begründung_ and _Bestätigung_ is evidently due to the presence of the\r\nexperimental element in the latter. For descriptive purposes this\r\ndistinction is useful, but is misleading if it is understood to mean\r\nthat there is mere experience in one case and mere inference in the\r\nother. The difference is rather due to the relative parts played by\r\ninference and by accepted experience in each. In _Begründung_ the\r\ninferential feature is the more prominent, while in _Bestätigung_ the\r\nmain emphasis is on the experiential aspect. It must not be supposed,\r\nhowever, that either of these aspects can be wholly absent. It is\r\ndifficult to understand how any hypothesis can be entertained at all\r\nunless it meets in some measure the demand with reference to which it\r\nwas invented, viz., a unification of conflicts in experience. And, _in\r\nso far_, it is confirmed. The motive which casts doubt upon its adequacy\r\nis the same that leads to its re-forming as a hypothesis, as a mental\r\nconcept.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in Wundt's position are thus due to a failure to take\r\naccount of the reconstructive nature of the judgment. The predicate,\r\nsupposition, or hypothesis, whatever we may choose to call it, is formed\r\nbecause of the check of a former habit. The judgment is an ideal\r\napplication of a new habit, and its test is the attempt to act in\r\naccordance with this ideal reconstruction. It must not be thought,\r\nhowever, that our supposition is first fully developed and then tried\r\nand accepted or rejected without modification. On the contrary, its\r\ngrowth is the result of successive minor tests and corresponding minor\r\nmodifications in its form. Formation and test are merely convenient\r\ndistinctions in a larger process in which forming, testing, and\r\n_re_-forming go on together. The activity of experimental verification\r\nis not only a testing, a confirming or weakening of the validity of a\r\nhypothesis, but it is equally well an evolution of the _meaning_ of the\r\nhypothesis through bringing it into closer relations with specific data\r\nnot previously included in defining its import. _Per contra_, a purely\r\nreflective and deductive consideration which develops the idea as\r\nhypothesis, _in so far_ as it introduces the determinateness of\r\npreviously accepted facts within the scope, comprehension, or intension\r\nof the idea, is in so far forth, a verification.\r\n\r\nIf the view which we have maintained is correct, the hypothesis is not\r\nto be limited to those elaborate formulations of the scientist which he\r\nseeks to confirm by crucial tests. The hypothesis of the investigator\r\ndiffers from the comparatively rough conjecture of the plain man only in\r\nits greater precision. Indeed, as we have attempted to show, the\r\nhypothesis is not a method which we may employ or not as we choose; on\r\nthe contrary, as predicate of the judgment it is present in a more or\r\nless explicit form if we judge at all. Whether the time and labor\r\nrequired for its confirmation or rejection is a matter of a lifetime or\r\na moment, its nature remains the same. Its function is identical with\r\nthat of the predicate. In short, the hypothesis is the predicate so\r\nbrought to consciousness and defined that those features which are not\r\nnoticed in the ordinary judgment are brought into prominence. We then\r\nrecognize the hypothesis to be what in fact the predicate always is,\r\nviz., a method of organization and control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIMAGE AND IDEA IN LOGIC\r\n\r\n\r\nThe logic of sense-impressions and of ideas as copies of\r\nsense-impressions has had its day. It engaged in a conflict with\r\ndogmatism, and scored a decisive victory. It overthrew the dynasty of\r\nprescribed formulæ and innate ideas, of ideas derived ready-made from\r\ncustom and social usage, ancient enough to be lost in the remote\r\nobscurity of divine sources; and enthroned in their place ideas derived\r\nfrom, and representative of, the sense-experiences of a very real and\r\npresent world. It marked a reaction from dogma back to the original\r\nmeaning of dogma, back to the seeming, the appearance, of things. So\r\nthoroughly did Bacon and Hobbes, Locke and Hume, to mention only these\r\nfour, do their work, that many of the problems growing out of the\r\nconflict itself, to say nothing of the scholastic traditions that were\r\ncombated, have come to have merely a historical rather than a logical\r\ninterest. Logic no longer concerns itself very eagerly with the content\r\nor sensuous qualities of ideas, with their derivation from\r\nsense-impressions, or with questions as to the relation of copy to\r\noriginal, of representative to that which is presented. It is concerned\r\nrather with the constructive operations of thought, with meaning,\r\nreference to reality, inference--with intellectual processes. Perhaps in\r\nno respect is this shifting of logical standpoint indicated more clearly\r\nthan in the unregretful way with which the old logical interest in the\r\nsense-qualities of ideas is now made over to psychology. States of\r\nconsciousness as such, we are told, are the proper study of psychology;\r\nwhereas logic concerns itself with the relation of thought to its\r\nobject. True, these states of consciousness include thought-states, as\r\nwell as sense-impressions; ideas and concepts, as well as feelings and\r\nfancies; and the business of psychology is to observe, compare and\r\nclassify, describe and chronicle, these states and whatever else is\r\ncarried along in the stream of consciousness. But logic is concerned,\r\nnot with these states of consciousness _per se_, least of all with the\r\nflotsam and jetsam of the stream, but with its reference to reality; not\r\nwith the true, but with truth; not even with what consciousness does,\r\nbut with how consciousness is to outdo itself, transcend itself, in a\r\nrational and universal whole. Even an empirical logic has to arrange\r\nsomehow the way to get from one sense-impression to another.\r\n\r\nIn drawing this distinction between logic and psychology--a distinction\r\nwhich virtually amounts to a separation--two things are overlooked:\r\nfirst, that the distinction itself is a logical distinction, and may\r\nproperly constitute a problem falling under the province of logical\r\ninquiry and theory; and, second, that the rather arbitrary and official\r\nsetting apart of psychology to look after the task of studying states of\r\nconsciousness does not carry with it the guarantee that psychology will\r\nconfine itself exclusively to that task. This last point in particular\r\nmust be my excuse for discussing the question of image and idea from the\r\npsychological rather than from the logical standpoint. The logic of\r\nideas derived from sense-impressions has had its day. But even the very\r\nleavings of the past may have been gathered up and reconstructed by\r\npsychology in such a way as to anticipate some of the newer developments\r\nof logical theory and meet some of its difficulties. One can hardly hope\r\nto justify in advance a discussion based on such a sheer possibility.\r\nLet us begin, rather, by noting down from the standpoint of logic some\r\nof the distinctions between image and idea, and the estimate of the\r\nlogical function and value of mental imagery, and see in what direction\r\nthey take us and whether they suggest a resort to an analysis from the\r\nstandpoint of psychology.\r\n\r\nProceeding from the standpoint of logic to inquire into the logical\r\nfunction of mental imagery and into the distinction between image and\r\nidea, we shall come upon two opposed but characteristic answers. If the\r\ninquiry be directed to a member of the empirical school of logic, he\r\nwould be bound to answer in the affirmative, so far as the question\r\nregarding the function of mental imagery is concerned. He would be\r\nlikely to say, if he were loyal to the traditions of his school, that\r\nmental imagery is the counterpart of sense-perception, and is thus the\r\nrepresentative of the data with which empirical logic is concerned.\r\nMental imagery, he would continue, is a representative in a literal\r\nsense, a copy, a reflection, of what comes to us through the avenues of\r\nsensation. True, it is not the perfect twin of sense-experience; else we\r\ncould not tell them apart; indeed, there are times when the copy becomes\r\nso much like the original that we are deceived by it, as in dreams or in\r\nhallucinations. Ordinarily, however, we are able to distinguish one from\r\nthe other. Two criteria are usually present; (1) imagery is fainter,\r\nmore fleeting, than the corresponding sense-experience; and (2), save in\r\nthe case of accurate memory-images, it is subject to a more or less\r\narbitrary rearrangement of its parts, as when, for example, we make over\r\nthe images of scenes we have actually experienced, to furnish forth the\r\nsetting of some remote historical event.\r\n\r\nBarring, or controlling and rectifying, its tendencies toward both\r\narbitrary and constructive variations from the original, mental imagery\r\nis on the same level as sense-experience, and serves the same logical\r\npurpose. That is to say, it contributes to the data which constitute the\r\nfoundations of empirical logic. It furnishes materials for the\r\noperations of observing, comparing, abstracting and generalizing.\r\nMental imagery helps to piece out the fragments that may be presented to\r\nsense-experience. It supplies the entire anatomy when only a single\r\nbone, say, is actually given. Yet, however useful as a servant of truth,\r\nit has to be carefully watched, lest its spontaneous tendency to vary\r\nthe actual order and coexistence of data lead the investigator astray.\r\nThe copy it presents is, after all, a temporary makeshift, until it can\r\nbe shown to correspond point for point to the now absent reality. Mental\r\nimagery furnishes one with an illustrated edition of the book of nature,\r\nbut the illustrations await the confirmation of comparison with the\r\noriginals.\r\n\r\nMental imagery functions logically when it extends the area of data\r\nbeyond the range of the immediate sense-perceptions of any given time,\r\nand thus makes possible a more comprehensive application of the\r\nempirical methods of observation, comparison, abstraction, and\r\ngeneralization. It functions logically when it acts as a feeder of\r\nlogical machinery, though it is not indispensable to this machinery and\r\ndoes not modify its principles. The logical mill could grind up in the\r\nsame way the pure grain of sense-perceptions, unmixed with mental\r\nimages, but it would have to grind more slowly for lack of material. In\r\nother words, empirical logic could carry on its operations of observing,\r\ncomparing, abstracting, and generalizing, solely on the basis of objects\r\nor data present to the senses, and with no extension of this basis in\r\nterms of imagery, or copies of objects not immediately present; but it\r\nwould take more time for it to apply and carry through its operations.\r\nThe logical machinery is the same in each case. The materials fed and\r\nthe product issuing are the same in each case. Imagery simply fulfils\r\nthe function of providing a more copious grist.\r\n\r\nThe empiricist's answer to our question regarding the logical function\r\nof mental imagery leaves that function in an uncertain and parlous\r\nstate. Imagery lacks the security of sense-perception on the one hand,\r\nand it has no part in the operation of thought on the other. It is a\r\nsort of hod-carrier, whose function it is to convey the raw materials of\r\nsense-perception to a more exalted position where someone else does all\r\nthe work. I suppose this could be called a functional interpretation of\r\na logical element. The question, then, would be whether an element so\r\nfunctioning is in any sense logical. As an element lying outside of the\r\nthought-process it owes no responsibility to logic; it is not amenable\r\nto its regulations. Thought simply finds it expedient to operate with an\r\nagent over which it has no intrinsic control. The case might be allowed\r\nto rest here. Yet were this extra-logical element of imagery to abandon\r\nthought, all conscious thinking as opposed to sense-perception would\r\ncease. A false alarm, perhaps. Imagery may be so constituted that it is\r\ninseparably subordinated to thought and can never abandon it. Thought\r\nmay simply exude imagery. But imagery somehow has to represent\r\nsense-perception, also. It can hardly be a secretion of thought and a\r\ncopy of sense-perceptions at one and the same time, unless the\r\nempiricist is willing to turn absolute idealist! Before taking such a\r\ndesperate plunge as this, it might be desirable to see whether there is\r\nany other recourse.\r\n\r\nThere is another and a very different answer to the question regarding\r\nthe logical function of mental imagery. To distinguish this answer from\r\nthat of the associationist or empiricist, I will call it the answer of\r\nthe conceptualist. I am not at all positive that this label would stick\r\neven to those to whom it might be applied with considerable\r\njustification. The terms \"rationalistic\" and \"transcendental\" might be\r\npreferred in opposition to the term \"empirical.\" And we have the term\r\n\"apperceptionist\" in opposition to the term \"associationist.\" If the\r\nterm \"conceptualist\" is admissible, it should be brought down to date,\r\nperhaps, by making it \"neo-conceptualist.\" The present difficulties\r\nregarding terminology would be eased considerably if we only had a\r\nconvenient set of derivatives made from the word \"meaning.\" Since we\r\nhave not, I will use derivatives made from the word \"concept\" to denote\r\nviews opposite to those held by the empirical school.\r\n\r\nThe conceptualist could be depended upon to answer our question in the\r\nnegative. Logical functions begin where the image leaves off. They begin\r\nwith the _idea_, with meaning. The conceptualist distinguishes sharply\r\nbetween the image as a psychical existence and the idea, or concept, as\r\nlogical meaning. On the one hand, you have the \"image,\" not only as a\r\nmere psychical existence, but a mocking existence at that, fleeting,\r\ninconstant, shifting, never perhaps twice alike; yet, mind you, an\r\n_existence_, a _fact_--that must be admitted. On the other hand, you\r\nhave the \"idea,\" with \"a fixed content or logical meaning,\"[80] which is\r\nreferred by an act of judgment to a reality beyond the act.[81]\r\n\r\nThe \"idea,\" the logical meaning, begins where the \"image\" leaves off.\r\nDoes this mean that the \"idea\" is wholly independent of the \"image\"? Yes\r\nand no. The \"idea\" is independent of that which is ordinarily regarded\r\nas the special characteristic of an \"image,\" namely, its quality, its\r\nsense-content. That is to say, the \"idea\" is independent of any\r\nparticular \"image,\" any special embodiment of sense-content. Any image\r\nwill do. As Mr. Bosanquet remarks in comparing the psychical images that\r\npass through our minds to a store of signal flags:\r\n\r\n    Not only is it indifferent whether your signal flag of today is\r\n    the same bit of cloth that you hoisted yesterday, but also, no one\r\n    knows or cares whether it is clean or dirty, thick or thin, frayed\r\n    or smooth, as long as it is distinctly legible as an element of\r\n    the signal code. Part of its content, of its attributes and\r\n    relations, is a fixed index which carries a distinct reference;\r\n    all the rest is nothing to us, and, except in a moment of idle\r\n    curiosity, we are unaware that it exists.[82]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the \"idea\" could not operate as an idea, could not be\r\nin consciousness, save as it involves some imagery, however old, dirty,\r\nthin, and frayed. Take the statement, \"The angles of a triangle are\r\nequal to two right angles.\" If the statement means anything to a given\r\nindividual, if it conveys an idea, it must necessarily involve some form\r\nof imagery, some qualitative or conscious content. But so far as the\r\n_meaning_ is concerned, it is a matter of complete indifference as to\r\n_what_ qualities are involved. These qualities may be in terms of\r\nvisual, auditory, tactual, kinæsthetic, or verbal imagery. The\r\nindividual may visualize a blackboard drawing of a triangle with its\r\nsides produced, or he may imagine himself to be generating a triangle\r\nwhile revolving through an angle of 180°. Any imagery anyone pleases may\r\nbe employed, so long as there goes with it somehow the _idea_ of the\r\nrelation of equality between the angles of a triangle and two right\r\nangles. But the conceptualist does not stop here. The act of judgment\r\ncomes in to affirm that the \"idea\" is no mere idea, but is a quality of\r\nthe real. \"The act [of judgment] attaches the floating adjective [the\r\nidea, the logical meaning] to the nature of the world, and, at the same\r\ntime, tells one it was there already.\"[83] The \"idea,\" the logical\r\nmeaning, begins where the \"image\" leaves off. Yet, somehow, the \"idea\"\r\ncould not begin, unless there were an \"image\" to leave off.\r\n\r\nAn \"image\" is not an \"idea,\" says the conceptualist. An \"idea\" is not an\r\n\"image.\" (1) An \"image\" is not an \"idea,\" because an \"image\" is a\r\nparticular, individual fragment of consciousness. It is so bound up\r\nwith its own existence that it cannot reach out to the existence of an\r\n\"idea,\" or to anything beyond itself. Chemically speaking, it is an\r\n_avalent_ atom of consciousness, if such a thing is thinkable. Mr.\r\nBosanquet raises the question:\r\n\r\n    Are there at all ideas which are not symbolic?... The answer is\r\n    that _(a)_ in judgment itself the idea can be distinguished _qua_\r\n    particular in time or psychical fact, and _so far_ is not\r\n    symbolic; and _(b)_ in all those human experiences from which we\r\n    draw our conjectures as to the animal intelligence, when in\r\n    languor or in ignorance image succeeds image without conscious\r\n    judgment, we feel what it is to have ideas as facts and not as\r\n    symbols.[84]\r\n\r\n(2) An \"idea\" is not an \"image,\" because an idea _is_ meaning, which\r\nconsists in a part of the content of the image, cut off, and considered\r\napart from the _existence_ of the content or sign itself.[85] This\r\nmeaning, this fragment of psychical existence, lays down all claim to\r\nexistence on its own account, that it may refer through an act of\r\njudgment to a reality beyond itself and beyond the act also. An \"image\"\r\nis not an \"idea\" and an \"idea\" is not an \"image,\" because an \"image\"\r\nexists only as a quality, a sense-content, whereas an \"idea\" exists only\r\nas a relation, a reference to reality beyond. \"On the one hand,\" to\r\nrecall Bradley's antinomy, \"no possible idea [as a psychical image] can\r\nbe that which it means.... On the other hand, no idea [as logical\r\nsignification] is anything but just what it means.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a significant point of agreement between the conceptualist and\r\nthe empiricist. Both regard imagery as on the level with\r\nsense-perception. For the empiricist, as we have seen, the fact that\r\nimagery may be compelled to serve as a yoke-fellow of sense-experience\r\nconstitutes its logical value. For the conceptualist, however, the\r\nassociation of imagery with sense-experience is of no logical\r\nconsequence whatsoever, save as it may help to intensify the distinction\r\nbetween imagery and meaning. To quote again from Bradley:\r\n\r\n    For logical purposes the psychological distinction of idea and\r\n    sensation may be said to be irrelevant, while the distinction of\r\n    idea and fact is vital. The image, or psychological idea, is for\r\n    logic nothing but a sensible reality. It is on a level with the\r\n    mere sensations of the senses. For both are facts and neither are\r\n    meanings. Neither are cut from a mutilated presentation and fixed\r\n    as a connection. Neither are indifferent to their place in the\r\n    stream of psychical events, their time and their relations to the\r\n    presented congeries. Neither are adjectives to be referred from\r\n    their existence, to live on strange soils, under other skies, and\r\n    through changing seasons. The lives of both are so entangled with\r\n    their environment, so one with their setting of sensuous\r\n    particulars, that their character is destroyed if but one thread\r\n    is broken.[86]\r\n\r\nThis point of agreement between conceptualism and empiricism, this\r\nplacing of imagery and sense-experience on a common level, serves to\r\nbring into relief fundamental differences between the two schools of\r\nthought; fundamental, because they have to do with the nature of reality\r\nitself. The conceptualist in his zealous endeavor to distinguish between\r\nimagery and logical meaning has come perilously near driving imagery\r\ninto the arms of reality. It is the opportunity of empiricism to make\r\nthem one. How can conceptualism prevent the union? Has it not disarmed\r\nitself? The act of judgment, which includes within itself logical\r\nmeaning as predicate, refers to a reality beyond the act. Both imagery\r\nand reality, then, lie outside of the act of judgment! What alliance, or\r\n_mésalliance_, may they not form, one with the other?\r\n\r\nThe difficulties we have noted thus far in the discussion are due to a\r\nlarge extent, I believe, to incomplete psychological analysis of\r\nlogical machinery. The empiricist has not carried the psychology of\r\nlogic as far as the conceptualist, although the latter might be the\r\nloudest to disclaim the honor. I will not try to prove this statement,\r\nbut simply give it as a reason why, in the interest of brevity, I shall\r\npass with little comment over the psychological shortcomings and\r\ncontributions of empirical logic, and devote what space remains to the\r\npsychology implicitly worked out by conceptual logic, and to its\r\npossible development, with special reference, of course, to the problem\r\nof the logical function of imagery.\r\n\r\nThe logical distinction, which practically amounts to a separation\r\nbetween imagery and meaning, is the counterpart of the psychological\r\ndistinction between stimulus and response, between the two poles of\r\nsensori-motor activity, where the stimulus is defined in consciousness\r\nin the form of imagery, in the form of sense-qualities centrally\r\nexcited, and where the response is directed and controlled _via_ this\r\nimagery, so as to function in bringing some end, project, purpose, or\r\nideal, nearer to realization, some problem nearer to solution.\r\n\r\nPsychologically, there is no break between image and response, between\r\nthought and action. The stimulus is a condition of action, in both\r\nsenses of the ambiguity of the word \"condition.\" (1) It _is_ action; it\r\nis a state or condition of action. (2) It is also an initiation of\r\naction. _If_ the appropriate stimulus, then the desired action. The\r\nresponse to an image is the meaning of the image. Or, the response to\r\nany stimulus _via_ an image--mediated, controlled or directed by an\r\nimage--is the meaning of that image. The less imagery involved in any\r\nresponse, the greater the presumption in favor of the belief that the\r\nresponse is either an instinctive impulse or else has become a habit of\r\nmind, an adequate idea. The reduction and loss of sense-content which an\r\nimage may undergo--the wearing away of an image, it is sometimes\r\ncalled--is not a sign that this sense-content has no logical function;\r\nbut rather that it has fulfilled a logical function so well that it has\r\nmade part of itself useless. The husk, to recall one of Mr. Bradley's\r\ncomparisons, that useless husk, tends to fall away, to lapse from\r\nconsciousness, after it has served the purpose of helping to bring the\r\nkernel of truth to fruition.\r\n\r\nThis raises again the original question as to whether the sense-content,\r\nthe quality, the existential quality, of an image has a logical\r\nfunction. I will ask first whether it has a function from the standpoint\r\nof psychology. We will agree with the empiricist that the content of an\r\nimage is representative, that it is a return, a revival, of a\r\nsense-content previously experienced through the activity of\r\nsense-organs stimulated from the periphery. What is the function, then,\r\nof the representative image? Sensation, quality, as we have implied\r\nabove, is the stimulus come to consciousness. To explain how a stimulus\r\ncan \"come\" to consciousness is a problem I will not attempt to go into\r\nhere. I assume as a fact that there are times when we know what we are\r\nabout; when we are conscious of the stimuli, or conditions of action,\r\nwhich are tending in this direction or in that, and when through this\r\nconsciousness we exercise a controlling influence over action by\r\nselecting and reinforcing certain stimuli and suppressing or inhibiting\r\nothers. It is true that we do not always realize to how great an extent\r\nour actions are controlled by stimuli which do not come to\r\nconsciousness, by reflexes, instincts, and habits which do not rise\r\nabove the threshold of imagery. And when this vast complex of hidden\r\nmachinery is partly revealed to us, it may either cause the beholder to\r\ntake a materialistic, mechanical, or fatalistic view of existence, to\r\nsay that we are the victims of our own machinery, or else it may induce\r\nthe other extreme of more or less mystic pronouncements regarding the\r\nprovince of the subconscious, of the subliminal self; thus out of\r\npartial views, out of half-truths, metaphysical problems arise and arm\r\nfor mutual conflict. Nevertheless, there is a presumption, amounting in\r\nmost minds to a conviction, that we do at times consciously control some\r\nof our actions. And it is only making this conviction a little more\r\nexplicit to say that we consciously control our actions through becoming\r\naware of the stimuli, or conditions of action, and through selecting and\r\nreinforcing them.\r\n\r\nIs it begging the question to speak of consciousness as exercising a\r\nselective function with reference to stimuli? From the standpoint of\r\npsychology, I cannot see that it is. No characteristic of consciousness\r\nhas been more clearly made out, both reflectively and experimentally,\r\nthan its selective function, than its ability to pick out and intensify\r\nwithin certain limits the stimuli or conditions of action.\r\n\r\nThe representational image is a stimulus come to consciousness in the\r\nsame way that a sensation is a stimulus come to consciousness. It is\r\nboth a direct and an indirect stimulus. The terms \"direct\" and\r\n\"indirect\" are used as relative solely to the demands of the particular\r\nsituation out of which they arise. By direct stimulus I mean a stimulus\r\nwhich initiates with almost no appreciable delay the response or\r\nattitude appropriate to the demands of a given situation, bridging the\r\ndifficulties, removing the obstacles, or solving the problem with the\r\nminimum of conscious reflection. As an image becomes more and more of a\r\nworking symbol, an idea, it tends to become simply a direct stimulus.\r\n\r\nBy an \"indirect stimulus\" is meant a stimulus initiating a response\r\nwhich, if not inhibited, would be irrelevant to the situation, yet which\r\nmay represent stimuli which are not found in the immediate field of\r\nsense-perception, and which are essential to the carrying on of the\r\nactivity. The situation is a problematic one. Acquired habits or mental\r\nadjustments break down at some point or fail to operate smoothly, either\r\nowing to the absence of customary stimuli or to the presence of new and\r\nuntried conditions of action. Part of the stress of meeting such a\r\nsituation as this falls on the side of discovering appropriate stimuli\r\nand part on the side of developing out of habits already acquired new\r\nmethods of response.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation as this, imagery may function on the side of\r\n_stimulus_ when, taking its cue from the stimuli which are actually\r\npresent, and which grow out of the strain and friction, it represents\r\nthe missing conditions of action sufficiently to direct a search for\r\nthem. It projects a map, so to speak, in which the fragmentary\r\nconditions immediately present to sense-perception may find their\r\nbearings, or in which in some way the missing members may be discovered.\r\nA familiar instance of this would be the experience one sometimes has in\r\ntrying to recall the forgotten name of an acquaintance. The images of\r\nscenes associated with the acquaintance, of various letters and sounds\r\nof words associated with his name, which may be called to mind, do not\r\nfunction so much as direct stimuli as they do as intermediate or\r\nindirect stimuli. It is a case of casting about for the image that will\r\nfunction as a direct stimulus in bringing an acquired but temporarily\r\nlost adjustment into play.\r\n\r\nImage functions on the side of _response_, on the side of developing new\r\nhabits, new forms of adjustment, in so far as the conditions of action\r\nwhich it represents, or projects, are not the actual conditions of\r\naction, either because they are so inaccessible as to demand development\r\nof new habits for purposes of attaining them, or else because, though\r\nactually present, they stimulate relatively uncontrolled æsthetic or\r\nemotional responses, whose very expression, however, may be translated\r\ninto a demand for more adequate, intelligent, controlled habits or\r\nadjustments. The conscious projection of the unattained, even of the\r\nunattainable, not only marks a certain degree of attainment, but is the\r\ninitiation of further development. Here we see again that a stimulus is\r\na condition of action in both senses of the ambiguity of the word\r\n\"condition.\" It is both a state or condition of activity, and an\r\ninitiation or condition of further activity.\r\n\r\nAs an indirect stimulus growing out of a problematic situation imagery\r\nnecessarily brings in more or less irrelevant material. If I may be\r\npermitted the paradox, imagery would not be relevant if it did not bring\r\nin the irrelevant. The novelty of the situation makes it impossible to\r\nsay in advance what will be relevant. Hence the demand for range and\r\nplay of imagery. It is only the successful adjustment finally hit upon\r\nand worked out that is the test of the relevancy of the imagery which\r\nanticipated it. Even this test may be unfair, since it is likely to\r\ndiscount the value of imagery which is now ruled out, but which may have\r\nbeen indispensable in turning up the proper cues in the course of the\r\nprocess of reflection and experiment.\r\n\r\nTo restate the point in regard to the psychological function of imagery.\r\nImagery functions in representing control as ideal, not as fact. It\r\nrepresents a possible process of reconstructing adjustments and habits;\r\nit is not an actual and complete readjustment. It arises normally in a\r\nstress, in the presence of fresh demands and new problems. It looks\r\nforward in every possible direction, because it is important and\r\ndifficult to foresee consequences. But suppose the new adjustment to be\r\nmade with reasonable success--reasonable, note. Suppose the ideal to be\r\nrealized. With practice the adjustment becomes less problematic, more\r\nunder control--that is, it comes to require less conscious attention to\r\nbring it about. The image loses some of its sensuous content. It becomes\r\nworn away, more remote, until at last it becomes respectably vague and\r\nabstract enough to be classed as a concept. Imagery is the stimulus of\r\nthe reconstructive process between habit and habit, concept and concept,\r\nidea and idea.\r\n\r\nWe now return to the original question regarding the logical function of\r\nimagery. There is only one condition, I believe, on which we can accept\r\nthe assumption of both empiricist and conceptualist that imagery is on\r\nthe same level with sense-perception, and that is the assumption that\r\nmeaning, logical meaning, is on the same level with habit, habit naming\r\nthe more obvious, overt forms of response to stimuli, logical meaning\r\nnaming the more internal forms of response or reference. Psychical\r\nresponse and logical reference thus become equivalent terms.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that imagery may exercise two functions with reference to\r\nhabit, as direct and as indirect stimulus; so also with reference to\r\nlogical meaning, imagery may be the stimulus to a direct reference of\r\nthe idea to reality, or it may present, or mirror, conditions with\r\nregard to which some new meaning is to be worked out. The quality, the\r\nsense-content, of imagery may _per se_ suffice directly to arouse a\r\nhabitual attitude, to call forth an immediate reference to reality. It\r\nmay cause one to \"tumble\" to what is taking place, to \"catch on,\" to\r\napprehend (pardon these expressions for the sake of their description of\r\nthe motor aspect of meaning), as when we say, for example: \"It came over\r\nme like a flash what I was to do, and I did it.\" Our more abstract and\r\ncomplicated forms of judgment and reasoning, in which the imagery\r\ninvolved is reduced to the minimum of conscious, qualitative content,\r\nare of the same order, though at the other extreme, so far as immediate\r\novert expression is concerned. We are working along lines of habitual\r\nactivity so familiar that we can work almost in the dark. We need no\r\nelaborate imagery. Guided only by the waving of a signal flag or by the\r\nshifting gleam of a semaphore, we thread our way swiftly through the\r\nmaze of tracks worn smooth by use and habit. But suppose a new line of\r\nhabit is to be constructed. No signal flags or semaphores will suffice.\r\nA detailed survey of the proposed route must be had, and here is where\r\nimagery with a rich and varied yet flexible sensuous content, growing\r\nout of previous surveys, may function in projecting and anticipating the\r\nnew set of conditions, and thus become the stimulus of a new line of\r\nhabit, of a new and more far-reaching meaning. As this new line of\r\nhabit, of meaning, gets into working order with the rest of the system,\r\nimagery tends normally to decline again to the rôle of signal flags and\r\nsemaphores.\r\n\r\nThe distinction in logical theory between \"image\" and \"idea\" which we\r\nhave been considering is only a half-truth from the point of view of\r\npsychology. It virtually limits the \"idea\" to a fixed, unalterable\r\nreference of a fragment of a desiccated image to a reality beyond. It\r\nindifferently loses the play and richness of imagery to the floating\r\nremnants of sense-content, or to an external reality. It limits itself\r\nto an examination of a final stage in thinking, a stage in which the\r\nimage acts as a direct stimulus, a stage in which the sense-content of\r\nthe image has little or no function _per se_, because this content now\r\ninitiates directly a habitual adjustment, a worked-out and established\r\nadaptation of means to end. It overlooks the process of conscious\r\nreflection which logically precedes every such adjustment not purely\r\ninstinctive or accidental, a process in which imagery as\r\nrepresentational functions indirectly in bringing the resources of past\r\nexperience, the fund of acquired habits, to bear upon the fragmentary\r\nand problematic elements of sense-experience actually present, thus\r\nmaintaining the flow and continuity of experience. It fails to recognize\r\nthat in the inseparable association of meaning with quality, of \"idea\"\r\nwith \"image,\" there goes the possibility of working out and applying\r\nnew meanings from old, of developing deeper meanings, of testing and\r\naffirming more inclusive and universal meaning.\r\n\r\nWe are confronted with this alternative. Either the image has a logical\r\nfunction in virtue of its sense-content, or else the image functions\r\nlogically merely as a symbol, the sense-content of which is a matter of\r\ncomplete logical indifference. According to the empiricist, the former\r\nis the case, according to the conceptualist, the latter. The empiricist\r\nwould say that he needs the image to piece out the data upon which\r\nlogical processes operate. Having met this need, the image is retired\r\nfrom active service. For the empiricist the processes of thought,\r\nobserving, comparing, generalizing, etc., are as independent of the data\r\nthey use as, for the conceptualist, logical meaning, reference, and\r\n\"idea\" are independent of the sense-content of the \"image.\" In reality\r\nhe agrees with the conceptualist in excluding the sense-content of the\r\nimage from the processes of thought, and hence from the domain of logic.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of psychological theory the conceptualist is an\r\nimprovement over the empiricist. He has gone a step farther in the\r\nanalysis of thought-processes by showing that they are bound up with\r\nsome kind of imagery, however irrelevant, inconsequential, and worn down\r\nthe sense-quality of that imagery may be. His statement of ideas as\r\nreferences to reality lends itself readily, as we have seen, to the\r\nunitary conception in psychology of ideo-motor, or sensori-motor,\r\nactivity. But is this where logical theory is to stop, while psychology\r\nas a study of \"states of consciousness\" takes up the unfinished tale and\r\ncarries it forward? It seems hardly possible, unless logic is willing to\r\ngive over its task of thinking about thinking.\r\n\r\nReduce the image to a mere symbol. Let its sense-quality be a matter of\r\ncomplete indifference. What have you, then, but an elementary and\r\nprimitive type of reflex action? It is of no particular consequence even\r\nfrom what sense-organ it appears to proceed, or whether it appears to be\r\nperipherally or centrally excited. It is simply a case of feel and act;\r\ntouch and go. Is this thinking? It may be regarded as either the germ or\r\nthe finality of thinking, but what most of us are inclined to believe is\r\nthe true subject-matter of logic is not to be limited to a simple\r\nreflex, or even to a chain of reflexes. It is something more complex,\r\neven if nothing more than an intricate tangle of chains of reflexes.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of the process called thinking does not reside alone in\r\nthe instinctive or habitual reflexes involved. The more instinctive and\r\nhabitual any adjustment may be, the less is it a matter of thought, as\r\neveryone knows, although its biological complexity is none the less\r\npatent to one who looks at it from the outside. The complexity of the\r\nthinking process resides in consciousness also; it resides in the\r\nimagery, the stimuli, the mere symbols, if you like, that have \"come\" to\r\nconsciousness. As soon as the complexity begins to be _felt_, as soon as\r\nany discrimination whatsoever begins to be introduced or appreciated, at\r\nthat instant the sense-content, the quale, of imagery begins to have a\r\nlogical function. Conscious discrimination, however vague and\r\nevanescent, and the logical function of the quale of imagery are born\r\ntogether, unless one chooses to regard the more obvious and deliberate\r\nforms of conscious discrimination as more characteristic of a logical\r\nprocess. It is only as the sense-contents of various images are\r\ndiscriminated and compared that anything like thinking can be conceived\r\nto go on. The particular sense-content of an image, instead of being a\r\nmatter of logical indifference, is the condition, the possibility, of\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nThe conceptualist has contributed to the data of descriptive psychology\r\nby calling attention, by implication at least, to the remote and\r\nreduced character of the imagery which may characterize thinking. But it\r\nby no means follows that the more remote and reduced the sense-content\r\nof an image becomes, the less important is that sense-content for\r\nthinking, the less demand for discrimination. On the contrary, the\r\nsense-content that remains may be of supreme logical importance. It may\r\nbe the quintessence of meaning. It may be the conscious factor which,\r\nwhen discriminated from another almost equally sublimated conscious\r\nfactor, may determine a whole course of action. The delicacy and\r\nrapidity with which these reduced forms of imagery as they hover about\r\nthe margin of consciousness or flit across its focus are discriminated\r\nand caught, are points in the technique of that long art of\r\nthinking, begun in early childhood. The fact that questionnaire\r\ninvestigations--like that of Galton's, for example--have in many\r\ninstances failed to discover in the minds of scientists and advanced\r\nthinkers a rich and varied furniture of imagery does not argue the\r\npoverty of imagery in such minds; it argues, rather, a highly developed\r\ntechnique, a species of virtuosity, with reference to the sense-content\r\nof the types of imagery actually in use.\r\n\r\nTo push a step farther the alternative we have already stated in a\r\npreliminary way: Either the \"idea,\" or \"logical meaning,\" lies outside\r\nof the process of thinking, as a mere impulse or reflex; or else, in\r\nvirtue of the sense-content of its \"image,\" it enters into that\r\nconscious process of discrimination, comparison, and selection, of light\r\nand shade, of doubt and inquiry, which constitutes the evolution of a\r\njudgment, which makes the life-history of a movement of thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE LOGIC OF THE PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY[87]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this study to show that the Pre-Socratics\r\npossessed a system of logic which is now for the first time brought to\r\nthe notice of the modern world. Indeed, there is nothing to indicate\r\nthat they had reflected on mental processes in such a way as to call for\r\nan organized body of canons regulating the forms of concepts and\r\nconclusions. Aristotle attributed the discovery of the art of dialectic\r\nto Zeno the Eleatic, and we shall see in the sequel that there was much\r\nto justify the opinion. But logic, in the technical sense, is\r\ninconceivable without concepts, and from the days of Aristotle it has\r\nbeen universally believed that proper definitions owe their origin to\r\nSocrates. A few crude attempts at definition, if such they may be\r\nrightly called, are referred to Empedocles and Democritus. But in so far\r\nas they were conceived in the spirit of science, they essayed to define\r\nthings materially by giving, so to speak, the chemical formula for their\r\nproduction. Significant as this very fact is, it shows that even the\r\nrudiments of the canons of thought were not the subjects of reflection.\r\n\r\nIn his _Organon_ Aristotle makes it evident that the demand for a\r\nregulative art of scientific discourse was created by the eristic\r\nlogic-chopping of those who were most deeply influenced by the Eleatic\r\nphilosophy. Indeed, the case is quite parallel to the rise of the art of\r\nrhetoric. Aristotle regarded Empedocles as the originator of that art,\r\nas he referred the beginnings of dialectic to Zeno. But the formulation\r\nof both arts in well-rounded systems came much later. As men conducted\r\nlawsuits before the days of Tisias and Corax, so also were the essential\r\nprinciples of logic operative and effective in practice before Aristotle\r\ngave them their abstract formulation.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true, therefore, that the Pre-Socratics had no formal logic,\r\nit is equally true, and far more significant, that they either received\r\nfrom their predecessors or themselves developed the conceptions and the\r\npresuppositions on which the Aristotelian logic is founded. One of the\r\nobjects of this study is to institute a search for some of these basic\r\nconceptions of Greek thought, almost all of which existed before the\r\ndays of Socrates, and to consider their origin as well as their logical\r\nsignificance. The other aim here kept in view is to trace the course of\r\nthought in which the logical principles, latent in all attempts to\r\nconstruct and verify theories, came into play.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, no doubt, to discover a body of thought which does not\r\nground itself upon presuppositions. They are the warp into which the\r\nwoof of the system, itself too often consisting of frayed ends of other\r\nfabrics, is woven with the delight of a supposed creator. Rarely is the\r\nthinker so conscious of his own mental processes that he is aware of\r\nwhat he takes for granted. Ordinarily this retirement to an interior\r\nline takes place only when one has been driven back from the advanced\r\nposition which could no longer be maintained. Emerson has somewhere\r\nsaid: \"The foregoing generations beheld God and Nature face to face; we\r\nthrough their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to\r\nthe universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight\r\nand not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us and not the\r\nhistory of theirs?\" The difficulty lies precisely in our faith in\r\nimmediate insight and revelation, which are themselves only short-cuts\r\nof induction, psychological short circuits, conducted by media we have\r\ndisregarded. Only a fundamentally critical philosophy pushes its doubt\r\nto the limit of demanding the credentials of those conceptions which\r\nhave come to be regarded as axiomatic.\r\n\r\nThe need of going back of Aristotle in our quest for the truth is well\r\nshown by his attitude toward the first principles of the several\r\nsciences. To him they are immediately given--[Greek: amesoi\r\nprotaseis]--and hence are ultimate _a priori_. The historical\r\nsignificance of this fact is already apparent. It means that in his day\r\nthese first principles, which sum up the outcome of previous inductive\r\nmovements of thought, were regarded as so conclusively established that\r\nthe steps by which they had been inferred were allowed to lapse from\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nNo account of the history of thought can hope to satisfy the demands of\r\nreason that does not _explain_ the origin of the convictions thus\r\nembodied in principles. The only acceptable explanation would be in\r\nterms of will and interest. To give such an account would, however,\r\nrequire the knowledge of secular pursuits and ambitions no longer\r\nobtainable. It might be fruitful of results if we could discover even\r\nthe theoretical interests of the age before Thales; but we know that in\r\nmodern times the direction of interest characteristic of the purely\r\npractical pursuits manifests its reformative influences in speculation a\r\ncentury or more after it has begun to shape the course of common life.\r\nHence we might misinterpret the historical data if they were obtainable.\r\nBut general considerations, which we need not now rehearse, as well as\r\nindications contained in the later history of thought, hereinafter\r\nsketched, point to the primacy of the practical as yielding the\r\ndirection of interest that determines the course it shall take.\r\n\r\nIt was said above that the principles of science are the result of an\r\ninductive movement, and that the inductive movement is directed by an\r\ninterest. Hence the principles are contained in, or rather are the\r\nexpress definition of, the interest that gave them birth. In other\r\nwords, there is implied in all induction a process of deduction. Every\r\nstream of thought embraces not only the main current, but also an eddy,\r\nwhich here and there re-enters it. And this is one way of explaining the\r\nphenomenon which has long engaged the thought of philosophers, namely,\r\nthe fact of successful anticipations of the discoveries of science or,\r\nmore generally still, the possibility of synthetic judgments _a priori_.\r\nThe solution of the problem is ultimately contained in its\r\nstatement.[88]\r\n\r\nTo arrive at a stage of mentality not based on assumptions one would\r\nhave, no doubt, to go back to its beginnings. Greek thought, even in the\r\ntime of Thales, was well furnished with them. We cannot pause to\r\ncatalogue them, but it may further our project if we consider a few of\r\nthe more important. The precondition of thought as of life is that\r\nnature be uniform, or ultimately that the world be rational. This is not\r\neven, as it becomes later, a conscious demand; it is the primary ethical\r\npostulate which expresses itself in the confidence that it is so. Viewed\r\nfrom a certain angle it may be called the principle of sufficient\r\nreason. Closely associated with it is the universal belief of the early\r\nphilosophers of Greece that everything that comes into being is bound up\r\ninseparably with that which has been before; more precisely, that there\r\nis no absolute, but only relative, Becoming. Corollaries of this axiom\r\nsoon appeared in the postulates of the conservation of matter or mass,\r\nand the conservation of energy, or more properly for the ancients, of\r\nmotion. Logically these principles appear to signify that the subject,\r\nwhile under definition, shall remain just what it is; and that, in the\r\nsystem constituted of subject, predicate, and copula, the terms shall\r\n\"stay put\" while the adjustment of verification is in progress. It is a\r\nmatter of course that the constants in the great problem should become\r\npermanent landmarks.\r\n\r\nOther corollaries derive from this same principle of uniformity. Seeing\r\nthat all that comes to be in some sense already is, there appears the\r\npostulate of the unity of the world; and this unity manifests itself not\r\nonly in the integrity and homogeneity of the world-ground, but also in\r\nthe more ideal conception of a universal law to which all special modes\r\nof procedure in nature are ancillary. In these we recognize the\r\ninsistent demand for the organization of predicate and copula. Side by\r\nside with these formulæ stands the other, which requires an ordered\r\nprocess of becoming and a graduated scale of existences, such as can\r\nmediate between the extremes of polarity. Such series meet us on every\r\nhand in early Greek thought. The process of rarefaction and condensation\r\nin Anaximenes, the [Greek: hodos anô katô] of Heraclitus, the regular\r\nsuccession of the four Empedoclean elements in almost all later\r\nsystems--these and other examples spontaneously occur to the mind. The\r\nsignificance of this conception, as the representative of an effective\r\ncopula, will presently be seen. More subtle, perhaps, than any of these\r\nprinciples, though not allowed to go so long unchallenged, is the\r\nassumption of a [Greek: physis], that is, the assumption that all nature\r\nis instinct with life. The logical interpretation of this postulate\r\nwould seem to be that the concrete system of things--subject, predicate,\r\ncopula--constitutes a totality complete in itself and needing no jog\r\nfrom without.\r\n\r\nIn this survey of the preconceptions of the early Greek philosophers I\r\nhave employed the terms of the judgment without apology. The\r\njustification for this course must come ultimately, as for any\r\nassumption, from the success of its application to the facts. But if\r\n\"logic\" merely formulates in a schematic way that which in life is the\r\nmanipulation of concrete experience, with a view to attaining practical\r\nends, then its forms must apply here as well as anywhere. Logical\r\nterminology may therefore be assumed to be welcome to this field where\r\njudgments are formed, induction is made from certain facts to defined\r\nconceptions, and deductions are derived from principles or premises\r\nassumed. Speaking then in these terms we may say that the Pre-Socratics\r\nhad three logical problems set for them: First, there was a demand for a\r\npredicate, or, in other words, for a theory of the world. Secondly,\r\nthere was the need of ascertaining just what should be regarded as the\r\nsubject, or, otherwise stated, just what it was that required\r\nexplanation. Thirdly, there arose the necessity of discovering ways and\r\nmeans by which the theory could be predicated of the world and by which,\r\nin turn, the hypothesis erected could be made to account for the\r\nconcrete experience of life: in terms of logic this problem is that of\r\nmaintaining an efficient copula. It is not assumed that the sequence\r\nthus stated was historically observed without crossing and overlapping;\r\nbut a survey of the history of the period will show that, in a general\r\nway, the logical requirements asserted themselves in this order.\r\n\r\n1. Greek philosophy began its career with induction. We have already\r\nstated that the preconceptions with which it approached its task were\r\nthe result of previous inductions, and indeed the epic and theogonic\r\npoetry of the Greeks abounds in thoughts indicative of the consciousness\r\nof all of these problems. Thus Homer is familiar with the notion that\r\nall things proceed from water,[89] and that, when the human body decays,\r\nit resolves itself into earth and water.[90] Other opinions might be\r\nenumerated, but they would add nothing to the purpose. When men began,\r\nin the spirit of philosophy, to theorize about the world, they assumed\r\nthat it--the subject--was sufficiently known. Its existence was taken\r\nfor granted, and that which engaged their attention was the problem of\r\nits meaning. What predicate--so we may formulate their question--should\r\nbe given to the subject? It is noticeable that their induction was quite\r\nperfunctory. But such is always the case until there are rival theories\r\ncompeting for acceptance, and even then the impulse to gather up\r\nevidence derived from a wide field and assured by resort to experiment\r\ncomes rather with the desire to test a hypothesis than to form it. It is\r\nthe effort to _verify_ that brings out details and also the negative\r\ninstances. Hence we are not to blame Thales for rashness in making his\r\ngeneralization that all is Water. We do not know what indications led to\r\nthis conclusion. Aristotle ventured a guess, but the motives assumed for\r\nThales agree too well with those which weighed with Hippo to admit of\r\nready acceptance.\r\n\r\nAnaximander, feeling the need of deduction as a sequel to induction,\r\nfound his predicate in the Infinite. We cannot now delay to inquire just\r\nwhat he meant by the term; but it is not unlikely that its very\r\nvagueness recommended it to a man of genius who caught enthusiastically\r\nat the skirts of knowledge. Anaximenes, having pushed verification\r\nsomewhat farther and eliciting some negative instances, rejected water\r\nand the Infinite and inferred that all was air. His [Greek: archê] must\r\nhave the quality of infinity, but, a copula having been found in the\r\nprocess of rarefaction and condensation, it must occupy a determinate\r\nplace in the series of typical forms of existence. The logical\r\nsignificance of this thought will engage our attention later.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it may be well to note that thus far only _one_ predicate has\r\nbeen offered by each philosopher. This is doubtless due to the\r\npreconception of the unity and homogeneity of the world, of which we\r\nhave already made mention. Although at the beginning its significance\r\nwas little realized, the conception was destined to play a prominent\r\npart in Greek thought. It may be regarded from different points of view\r\nnot necessarily antagonistic. One may say, as indeed has oftentimes been\r\nsaid, that it was due to ignorance. Men did not know the complexity of\r\nthe world, and hence declared its substance to be simple. Again, it may\r\nbe affirmed that the assumption was merely the naïve reflex of the\r\nethical postulate that we shall unify our experience and organize it for\r\nthe realization of our ideals. While increased knowledge has multiplied\r\nthe so-called chemical elements, physics knows nothing of their\r\ndifferences, and chemistry itself demands their reduction.\r\n\r\nThe extension and enlarged scope of homogeneity came in two ways: First,\r\nit presented itself by way of abstraction from the particular predicates\r\nthat may be given to things. This was due to the operation of the\r\nfundamental assumption that the world must be intelligible. Thus, even\r\nin Anaximander, the world-ground takes no account of the diversity of\r\nthings except in the negative way of providing that the contrariety of\r\nexperience shall arise from it. We are therefore referred for our\r\npredicate to a somewhat behind concrete experience. The Pythagoreans fix\r\nupon a single aspect of things as the essential, and find the meaning of\r\nthe world in mathematical relations. The Eleatics press the conception\r\nof homogeneity until it is reduced to identity. Identity means the\r\nabsence of difference; hence, spatially considered, it requires the\r\nnegation of a void and the indivisibility of the world; viewed\r\ntemporally, it precludes the succession of different states and hence\r\nthe possibility of change.\r\n\r\nWe thus reach the acute stage of the problem of the One and the Many.\r\nThe One is here the predicate, the subject is the Many. The solution of\r\nthe difficulty is the task of the copula, and we shall recur to the\r\ntheme in due time. It may be well, however, at this point to draw\r\nattention to the fact that the One is not always identical with the\r\npredicate, nor the Many with the subject. In the rhythmic movement of\r\nerecting and verifying hypotheses the interest shifts and what was but\r\nnow the predicate, by taking the place of the premises, comes to be\r\nregarded as the given from which the particular is to be derived or\r\ndeduced. There is thus likewise a shift in the positions of existence\r\nand meaning. The subject, or the world, was first assumed as the given\r\nmeans with which to construct the predicate, its meaning; once the\r\nhypothesis has been erected, the direction of interest shifts back to\r\nthe beginning, and in the process of verification or deduction the\r\nquondam predicate, now the premises, becomes the given, and the task set\r\nfor thought is the derivation of fact. For the moment, or until the\r\nreturn to the world is accomplished, the One is the only real, the\r\nManifold remains mere appearance.\r\n\r\nThe second form in which the sense of the homogeneity of the world\r\nembodies itself is not, like the first, static, but is altogether\r\ndynamic. That which makes the whole world kin is neither the presence\r\nnor the absence of a quality, but a principle. The law thus revealed is,\r\ntherefore, not a matter of the predicate, but is the copula itself.\r\nHence we must defer a fuller consideration of it for the present.\r\n\r\n2. As has already been said, the inductive movement implies the\r\ndeductive, and not only as something preceding or accompanying it, but\r\nas its inner meaning and ultimate purpose. So too it was with the\r\nearliest Greek thinkers. Their object in setting up a predicate was the\r\nderivation of the subject from it. In other words their ambition was to\r\ndiscover the [Greek: archê] from which the genesis of the world\r\nproceeds. But deduction is really a much more serious task than would\r\nat first appear to one who is familiar with the Aristotelian machinery\r\nof premises and middle terms. The business of deduction is to reveal the\r\nsubject, and ordinarily the subject quite vanishes from view. Induction\r\nis rapid, but deduction lags far behind. It may require but a momentary\r\nflash of \"insight\" on the part of the physical philosopher to discover a\r\nprinciple; if it is really significant, inventors will be engaged for\r\ncenturies in deducing from it applications to the needs of life by means\r\nof contrivances. Thus after ages we come to know more of the subject,\r\nwhich is thereby enriched. The contrivances are the representatives of\r\nthe copula in practical affairs; in quasi-theoretical spheres they are\r\nthe apparatus for experimentation. It has just been remarked that by the\r\napplication of the principles to life it is enriched; in other words, it\r\nreceives new meaning, and new meaning signifies a new predicate. Theory\r\nis at times painfully aware of the multitude of new predicates proposed;\r\nrarely does it realize that there has been created a new heaven and a\r\nnew earth. Without the latter, the former would be absurd.\r\n\r\nMen take very much for granted and regard almost every achievement as a\r\nmatter of course. Hence they do not become aware of their changed\r\nposition except as it reflects itself in new schemes and in a larger\r\noutlook. The subject receives only a summary glance to discover what new\r\npredicate shall be evolved. Hence, while there is in Greek philosophy a\r\nstrongly marked deductive movement, the theoretical results to the\r\nsubject are insignificant. Thales seems, indeed, to have had no means to\r\noffer for the derivation of the world, but he evidently had no doubt\r\nthat it was possible. With him and with others the assumption, however\r\nvaguely understood, seems to have been that the subject, like the\r\npredicate, was simple. Thus the essential unity of the world, considered\r\nas existence no less than as meaning, is a foregone conclusion. The\r\nsense of a division in the subject seems to arise with Empedocles when,\r\nreaping the harvest of the Eleatic definition of substance, he parted\r\nthe world, as subject and as predicate, into four elements.\r\n\r\nWe may, perhaps, pause a moment to consider the significance of the\r\nassumption of four elements which plays so large a part in subsequent\r\nphilosophies. There is no need of enlarging on the importance of the\r\nassociation of multiple elements with the postulate that nothing is\r\nabsolutely created and nothing absolutely passes away. These are indeed\r\nthe pillars that support chemical science, and they further imply the\r\nexistence of qualities of different rank; but that implication, as we\r\nshall see, lay even in the process of rarefaction and condensation\r\nintroduced by Anaximenes. The four elements concern us here chiefly as\r\ntestifying to the fact that certain practical interests had summed up\r\nthe essential characteristics of nature in forms sufficiently\r\nsignificant to have maintained themselves even to our day. In regard to\r\nfire, air, and water this is not greatly to be wondered at; it is a\r\nsomewhat different case with earth. If metallurgy and other pursuits\r\nwhich deal with that which is roughly classed as earth had been highly\r\nenough developed to have reacted upon the popular mind, this element\r\ncould not possibly have been assumed to be so homogeneous. The\r\nconception clearly reflects the predominantly agricultural interest of\r\nthe Greeks in their relation to the earth. This further illustrates the\r\nslow progress which deduction makes in the reconstitution of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt is different, however, with Anaxagoras and the Atomists. Apparently\r\nthe movement begun by Empedocles soon ran its extreme course. Instead of\r\nfour elements there is now an infinite number of substances, each\r\ndifferentiated from the other. The meaning of this wide swing of the\r\npendulum is not altogether clear; but it is evident from the system of\r\nAnaxagoras that the metals, for example, possessed a significance which\r\nthey can not have had for Empedocles.\r\n\r\nThe opposite swing of the pendulum is seen in the later course of the\r\nEleatics. Given a predicate as fixed and unified as they assumed, the\r\nsubject cannot possibly be conceived in terms of it and hence it is\r\ndenied outright. In the dialectic of Zeno and Melissus, dealing with the\r\nproblems of the One and the Many, there is much that suggests the\r\nsolution offered by the Atomists; but it is probably impossible now to\r\nascertain whether these passages criticise a doctrine already propounded\r\nor pointed the way for successors. While the Eleatics asserted the sole\r\nreality of the One, Anaxagoras and the Atomists postulated a\r\nmultiplicity without essential unity. But the human mind seems to be\r\nincapable of resting in that decision; it demands that the world shall\r\nhave not meanings, but a meaning. This demand calls not only for a\r\nunified predicate, but also for an effective copula.\r\n\r\n3. We have already remarked that the steps by which the predicate was\r\ninferred are for the most part unknown. Certain suggestions are\r\ncontained in the reports of Aristotle, but it is safe to say that they\r\nare generally guesses well or ill founded. The summary inductive\r\nmediation has left few traces; and the process of verification, in the\r\ncourse of which hypotheses were rejected and modified, can be followed\r\nonly here and there in the records. Almost our only source of\r\ninformation is the dialectic of systems. Fortunately for our present\r\npurpose we do not need to know the precise form which a question assumed\r\nto the minds of the several philosophers; the efforts which they made to\r\nmeet the imperious demands of logic here speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no scheme for the mediation of the predicate back to\r\nthe subject. Indeed there seems not to have existed in the mind of\r\nThales a sense of its need. Anaximander raised the question, but the\r\nprocess of segregation or separation ([Greek: ekkrinesthai]) which he\r\npropounded was so vaguely conceived that it has created more problems\r\nthan it solved. Anaximenes first proposed a scheme that has borne\r\nfruits. He said that things are produced from air by rarefaction and\r\ncondensation. This process offers not only a principle of difference,\r\nbut also a regulative conception, the evaluation of which engaged the\r\nthought of almost all the later Pre-Socratics. It implies that extension\r\nand mass constitute the essential characters of substance, and, fully\r\napprehended, contains in germ the whole materialistic philosophy from\r\nParmenides at one extreme to Democritus and Anaxagoras at the other. The\r\ndifficulties inherent in the view were unknown to Anaximenes; for,\r\nhaving a unitary predicate, he assumed also a homogeneous subject.\r\n\r\nThe logical position of Heraclitus is similar to that of Anaximenes. He\r\nlikewise posits a simple predicate and further signalizes its functional\r\ncharacter by naming it Fire. Without venturing upon debatable ground we\r\nmay say that it was the restless activity of the element that caused him\r\nto single it out as best expressing the meaning of things. Its rhythmic\r\nlibration typified to him the principle of change in existence and of\r\nexistence in change. It is the \"ever-living\" copula, devouring subject\r\nand predicate alike and re-creating them functionally as co-ordinate\r\nexpressions of itself. That which alone _is_, the abiding, is not the\r\nphysical composition of a thing, but the law of reciprocity by which it\r\nmaintains a balance. This he calls variously by the names of Harmony,\r\nLogos, Necessity, Justice. In this system of functional co-ordinates\r\nnothing escapes the accounting on 'Change;[91] all things are in\r\ncontinuous flux, only the nodes of the rhythm remaining constant. It is\r\nnot surprising therefore that Heraclitus has been the subject of so much\r\nspeculation and comment in modern times; for the functional character of\r\nall distinctions in his system marks the affinity of his doctrines for\r\nthose of modern psychology and logic.[92]\r\n\r\nThe Pythagoreans, having by abstraction obtained a predicate,\r\nacknowledged the existence of the subject, but did not feel the need of\r\na copula in the theoretical sphere, except as it concerned the inner\r\nrelation of the predicate. To them the world was number, but number\r\nitself was pluralistic, or let us rather say dualistic. The odd and the\r\neven, the generic constituents of number, had somehow to be brought\r\ntogether. The bond was found in Unity, or, again, in Harmony. When they\r\ninquired how numbers constituted the world, their answer was in general\r\nonly a nugatory exercise of an unbridled fancy.[93] Such and such a\r\nnumber was Justice, such another, Man. It was only in the wholly\r\npractical sphere of experiment that they reached a conclusion worth\r\nrecording. Its significance they themselves did not perceive. Here, by\r\nthe application of mathematical measurements to sounds, they discovered\r\nhow to produce tones of a given pitch, and thus successfully\r\ndemonstrated the efficiency of their copula.\r\n\r\nThe Eleatics followed the same general course of abstraction; but with\r\nthem the sense of the unity of the world effaced its rich diversity.\r\nXenophanes does not appear to have pressed the conception so far as to\r\ndeny all change within the world. Parmenides, however, bated no jot of\r\nthe legitimate consequences of his logical position, interpreting, as he\r\ndid, the predicate, originally conceived as meaning, in terms of\r\nexistence. That which is simply _is_. Thus there is left only a one-time\r\npredicate, now converted into a subject of which only itself, as a brute\r\nfact, can be predicated. Stated logically, Parmenides is capable only of\r\nuttering identical propositions: A=A. The fallacious character of the\r\nreport of the senses and the impossibility of Becoming followed as a\r\nmatter of course. Where the logical copula is a mere sign of equation\r\nthere can be neither induction nor deduction. We are caught in a\r\ntheoretical _cul-de-sac_.\r\n\r\nWe are not now concerned to know in what light the demand for a treatise\r\non the world of Opinion may have appeared to Parmenides himself. The\r\navenues by which men reach conclusions which are capable of\r\nsimplification and syllogistic statement are too various to admit of\r\nplausible conjecture in the absence of specific evidence. But it is\r\nclear that his resort to the expedient reflected a consciousness of the\r\nstate of deadlock. In that part of his philosophical poem he dealt with\r\nmany questions of detail in a rather more practical spirit. Following\r\nthe lead of Heraclitus and the Pythagoreans he was more successful here\r\nthan in the field of metaphysics. Thus we see once more that the wounds\r\nof theory are healed by practice. But, as usual, even though the\r\nmetaphysician does receive the answer to his doubts by falling into a\r\nseverely practical pit and extricating himself by steps which he\r\nfashions with his hands, his mental habit is not thereby reconstructed.\r\nThe fixed predicate of the Eleatics was bequeathed to the\r\nPlatonic-Aristotelian formal logic, and induction and deduction remained\r\nfor centuries in theory a race between the hedgehog and the hare.[94]\r\nThe true significance of the destructive criticism brought to bear by\r\nZeno and Melissus on the concepts of unity, plurality, continuity,\r\nextension, time, and motion is simply this: that when by a shift of the\r\nattention a predicate becomes subject or meaning fossilizes as\r\nexistence, the terms of the logical process lose their functional\r\nreference and grow to be unmeaning and self-contradictory.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the Atomists\r\nsought to solve the problem of the One and the Many, of the subject and\r\nthe predicate, by shattering the unitary predicate and thus leaving the\r\nfield to plurality in both spheres. But obviously they were merely\r\npostponing the real question. Thought, as well as action, demands a\r\nunity somewhere. Hence the absorbing task of these philosophers is to\r\ndisclose or contrive such a bond of unity. The form which their quest\r\nassumed was the search for a basis for physical interaction.[95]\r\n\r\nEmpedocles clearly believed that he was solving the difficulty in one\r\nform when he instituted the rhythmic libration between unity under the\r\nsway of Love and multiplicity under the domination of Hate. But even he\r\nwas not satisfied with that. While Love brought all the elements\r\ntogether into a sphere and thus produced a unity, it was a unity\r\nconstituted of a mixture of elements possessing inalienable characters\r\nnot only different but actually antagonistic. On the other hand, Hate\r\ndid indeed separate the confused particles, but it effected a sort of\r\nunity in that, by segregating the particles of the several elements from\r\nthe others, it brought like and like together. In so far Aristotle was\r\nclearly right in attributing to Love the power to separate as well as to\r\nunite. Moreover, it would seem that there never was a moment in which\r\nboth agencies were not conceived to be operative, to however small an\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nEmpedocles asserted, however, that a world could arise only in the\r\nintervals between the extremes of victory in the contest between Love\r\nand Hate, when, so to speak, the battle was drawn and there was a\r\ngeneral _mêlée_ of the combatants. It may be questioned, perhaps,\r\nwhether he distinctly stated that in our world everything possessed its\r\nportion of each of the elements; but so indispensable did he consider\r\nthis _mixture_ that its function of providing a physical unity is\r\nunmistakable. A further evidence of his insistent demand for unity--the\r\ncopula--is found in his doctrine that only like can act on like; and the\r\nscheme of pores and effluvia which he contrived bears eloquent testimony\r\nto the earnest consideration he gave to this matter. For he conceived\r\nthat all interaction took place by means of them.\r\n\r\nEmpedocles, then, may be said to have annulled the decree of divorce he\r\nhad issued for the elements at the beginning. But the solution here too\r\nis found, not in the theoretical, but in the practical, sphere; for he\r\nnever retracts his assertion that the elements are distinct and\r\nantagonistic. But even so his problem is defined rather than solved; for\r\nafter the elements have been brought within microscopic distance of each\r\nother in the mixture, since like can act only on like, the narrow space\r\nthat separates them is still an impassable gulf.[96]\r\n\r\nAnaxagoras endowed his infinitely numerous substances with the same\r\ncharacters of fixity and contrariety that mark the four elements of\r\nEmpedocles. For him, therefore, the difficulty of securing unity and\r\nco-operation in an effective copula is, if that be possible, further\r\naggravated. His grasp of the problem, if we may judge from the\r\nrelatively small body of documentary evidence, was not so sure as that\r\nof Empedocles, though he employed in general the same means for its\r\nsolution. He too postulates a mixture of all substances, more\r\nconsciously and definitely indeed than his predecessor. Believing that\r\nonly like can act on like,[97] he is led to assume not only an infinite\r\nmultiplicity of substances, but also their complete mixture, so that\r\neverything, however small, contains a portion of every other. Food, for\r\nexample, however seeming-simple, nourishes the most diverse tissues of\r\nthe body. Thus we discover in the universal mixture of substances the\r\nbasis for co-operation and interaction.\r\n\r\nAnaxagoras, therefore, like Empedocles, feels the need of bridging the\r\nchasm which he has assumed to exist between his distinct substances.\r\nTheir failure is alike great, and is due to the presuppositions they\r\ninherited from the Eleatic conception of a severe homogeneity which\r\nimplies an absolute difference from everything else. The embarrassment\r\nof Anaxagoras increases with the introduction of the [Greek: Nous]. This\r\nagency was conceived with a view to explaining the formation of the\r\nworld; that is, with a view to mediating between the myriad substances\r\nin their essential aloofness and effecting the harmonious concord of\r\nconcrete things. While, even on the basis of a universal mixture, the\r\nfunction of the [Greek: Nous] was foredoomed to failure, its task was\r\nmade more difficult still by the definition given to its nature.\r\nAccording to Anaxagoras it was the sole exception to the composite\r\ncharacter of things; it is absolutely pure and simple in nature.[98] By\r\nits definition, then, it is prevented from accomplishing the work it was\r\ncontrived to do; and hence we cannot be surprised at the lamentations\r\nraised by Plato and Aristotle about the failure of Anaxagoras to employ\r\nthe agency he had introduced. To be sure, the [Greek: Nous] is no more\r\na _deus ex machina_ than were the ideas of Plato or the God of\r\nAristotle. They all labored under the same restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe Atomists followed with the same recognition of the Many, in the\r\ninfinitely various kinds of atoms; but it was tempered by the assumption\r\nof an essential homogeneity. One atom is distinguished from another by\r\ncharacteristics due to its spatial relations. Mass and weight are\r\nproportional to size. Aristotle reports that, though things and atoms\r\nhave differences, it is not in virtue of their differences, but in\r\nvirtue of their essential identity, that they interact.[99] There is\r\nthus introduced a distinction which runs nearly, but not quite, parallel\r\nto that between primary and secondary qualities.[100] Primary qualities\r\nare those of size, shape, and perhaps[101] position; all others are\r\nsecondary. On the other hand, that which is common to all atoms is their\r\ncorporeity, which does indeed define itself with reference to the\r\nprimary (spatial) qualities, but not alike in all. The atoms of which\r\nthe world is constituted are alike in essential nature, but they differ\r\nmost widely in position.\r\n\r\nIt is the void that breaks up the unity of the world--atomizes it, if we\r\nmay use the expression. It is the basis of all discontinuity. Atoms and\r\nvoid are thus polar extremes reciprocally exclusive. The atoms in their\r\nutter isolation in space are incapable of producing a world. In order to\r\nbridge the chasm between atom and atom, recourse is had to motion\r\neternal, omnipresent, and necessary. This it is that annihilates\r\ndistances. In the course of their motion atoms collide, and in their\r\nimpact one upon the other the Atomists find the precise mode of\r\nco-operation by which the world is formed.[102] To this agency are due\r\nwhat Lucretius happily called \"generating motions.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem, however, so insistently pursued the philosophers of this\r\ntime that the Atomists did not content themselves with this solution,\r\nsatisfactory as modern science has pretended to consider it. They\r\nfollowed the lead of Empedocles and Anaxagoras in postulating a\r\nwidespread, if not absolutely universal, _mixture_. Having on principle\r\nexcluded \"essential\" differences among the atoms, the impossibility of\r\nfinally distinguishing essential and non-essential had its revenge.\r\nImportant as the device of mixture was to Empedocles and Anaxagoras,\r\njust so unmeaning ought it to have been in the Atomic philosophy,\r\nprovided that the hypothesis could accomplish what was claimed for it.\r\nIt is not necessary to reassert that the assumption of \"individua,\"\r\nutterly alienated one from the other by a void, rendered the problem of\r\nthe copula insoluble for the Atomists.\r\n\r\nDiogenes of Apollonia is commonly treated contemptuously as a mere\r\nreactionary who harked back to Anaximenes and had no significance of his\r\nown. The best that can be said of such an attitude is that it regards\r\nphilosophical theories as accidental utterances of individuals,\r\nnaturally well or ill endowed, who happen to express conclusions with\r\nwhich men in after times agree or disagree. A philosophical tenet is an\r\natom, set somewhere in a vacuum, utterly out of relation to everything\r\nelse. But it is impossible to see how, on this theory, any system of\r\nthought should possess any significance for anybody, or how there should\r\nbe any progress even, or retardation.\r\n\r\nViewed entirely from without, the doctrine of Diogenes would seem to be\r\nsubstantially a recrudescence of that of Anaximenes. Air is once more\r\nthe element or [Greek: archê] out of which all proceeds and into which\r\nall returns. Again the process of transformation is seen in rarefaction\r\nand condensation; and the attributes of substance are those which were\r\ncommon to the early hylozoists. But there is present a keen sense of a\r\nproblem unknown to Anaximenes. What the early philosopher asserted in\r\nthe innocence of the youth of thought, the later physiologist reiterates\r\nwith emphasis because he believes that the words are words of life.\r\n\r\nThe motive for recurring to the earlier system is supplied by the\r\nimperious demand for a copula which had so much distressed Empedocles,\r\nAnaxagoras, and the Atomists. And here we are not left to conjecture,\r\nbut are able to refer to the _ipsissima verba_ of our philosopher. After\r\na brief prologue, in which he stated that one's starting-point must be\r\nbeyond dispute, he immediately[103] turned to his theme in these\r\nwords:[104] \"In my opinion, to put the whole matter in a nutshell, all\r\nthings are derived by alteration from the same substance, and indeed all\r\nare one and the same. And this is altogether evident. For if the things\r\nthat now exist in the world--earth and water and air and fire and\r\nwhatsoever else appears to exist in this world--if, I say, any one of\r\nthese were different from the other, different that is to say in its\r\nproper peculiar nature, and did not rather, being one and the same,\r\nchange and alter in many ways, then in no-wise would things be able to\r\nmix with one another, nor would help or harm come to one from the other,\r\nnor would any plant spring from the earth, nor any other living thing\r\ncome into being, if things were not so constituted as to be one and the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nThese words contain a singularly interesting expression of the need of\r\nrestoring the integrity of the process which had been lost in the effort\r\nto solve the problem of the One and the Many without abandoning the\r\npoint of view won by the Eleatics. Aristotle and Theophrastus paraphrase\r\nand sum up the passage above quoted by saying[105] that interaction is\r\nimpossible except on the assumption that all the world is one and the\r\nsame. Hence it is manifest, as was said above, that the return of\r\nDiogenes to the monistic system of Anaximenes had for its conscious\r\nmotive the avoidance of the dualism that had sprung up in the interval\r\nand had rendered futile the multiplied efforts to secure an effective\r\ncopula.\r\n\r\nWe should note, however, that in the attempt thus made to undo the work\r\nof several generations Diogenes retained the principle which had wrought\r\nthe mischief. We have before remarked that the germ of the Atomic\r\nphilosophy was contained in the process of rarefaction and condensation.\r\nHence, in accepting it along with the remainder of Anaximenes's theory,\r\nthe fatal assumption was reinstated. It is the story of human systems in\r\nepitome. The superstructure is overthrown, and with the débris a new\r\nedifice is built upon the old foundations.\r\n\r\nIn the entire course of philosophical thought from Thales onward the\r\nsuggestion of an opposition between the subject and the predicate had\r\nappeared. It has often been said that it was expressed by the search for\r\na [Greek: physis], or a _true nature_, in contrast with the world as\r\npractically accepted. There is a certain truth in this view; for the\r\neffort to attain a predicate which does not merely repeat the subject\r\ndoes imply that there is an opposition. But the efforts made to return\r\nfrom the predicate to the subject, in a deductive movement, shows that\r\nthe difference was not believed to be absolute. This is true, however,\r\nonly of those fields of speculation that lie next to the highways of\r\npractical life, which lead equally in both directions, or, let us\r\nrather say, which unite while they mark separation. In the sphere of\r\nabstract ideas the sense of embarrassment was deep and constantly\r\ngrowing deeper. The reconstruction, accomplished on lower levels, did\r\nnot attain unto those heights. Men doubted conclusions, but did not\r\nthink to demand the credentials of their common presuppositions.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the later philosophers whom we have mentioned there\r\nwalked men whom we are wont to call the Sophists. They were the\r\njournalists and pamphleteers of those days, men who, without dealing\r\nprofoundly with any special problem, familiarized themselves with the\r\ngeneralizations of workers in special fields and combined these ideas\r\nfor the entertainment of the public. They were neither philosophers nor\r\nphysicists, but, like some men whom we might cite from our own times,\r\nendeavored to popularize the teachings of both. Naturally they seized\r\nupon the most sweeping generalizations and the preconceptions which\r\ndisclosed themselves in manifold forms. Just as naturally they had no\r\neyes with which to detect the significance of the besetting problems at\r\nwhich, in matters more concrete, the masters were toiling. Hence the\r\ncontradictions, revealed in the analysis we have just given of the\r\nphilosophy of the age, stood out in utter nakedness.\r\n\r\nThe result was inevitable. The inability to discover a unitary\r\npredicate, more still, the failure to attain a working copula, led\r\ndirectly to the denial of the possibility of predication. There was no\r\ntruth. Granted that it existed, it could not be known. Even if known, it\r\ncould not be communicated. In these incisive words of Gorgias the\r\nconclusion of the ineffectual effort to establish a logic of science is\r\nclearly stated. But the statement is happily only the half-truth, which\r\nis almost a complete falsehood. It takes no account of the indications,\r\neverywhere present, of a needed reconstruction. Least of all does it\r\ncatch the meaning of such a demand.\r\n\r\nThe Sophists did not, however, merely repeat in abstract from the\r\nteachings of the philosophers. It matters not whether they originated\r\nthe movement or not; at all events they were pioneers in the field of\r\nmoral philosophy. Here it was that they chiefly drew the inferences from\r\nthe distinction between [Greek: physei] and [Greek: nomô]. Nothing could\r\nhave been more effective in disengaging the firmly rooted moral\r\npre-possessions and rendering them amenable to philosophy. Just here, at\r\nlast, we catch a hint of the significance of the logical process. In a\r\nstriking passage in Plato's _Protagoras_,[106] which one is fain to\r\nregard as an essentially true reproduction of a discourse by that great\r\nman, Justice and Reverence are accorded true validity. On inquiring to\r\nwhat characteristic this honorable distinction is due, we find that it\r\ndoes not reside in themselves; it is due to _the assumption that a state\r\nmust exist_.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in a word, is the upshot of the logical movement. Logical\r\npredicates are essentially hypothetical, deriving their validity from\r\nthe interest that moves men to affirm them. When they lose this\r\nhypothetical character, as terms within a volitional system, and set up\r\nas entities at large, they cease to function and forfeit their right to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nVALUATION AS A LOGICAL PROCESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this discussion is to supply the main outlines of a\r\ntheory of value based upon analysis of the valuation-process from the\r\nlogical point of view. The general principle which we shall seek to\r\nestablish is that judgments of value, whether passed upon things or upon\r\nmodes of conduct, are essentially objective in import, and that they are\r\nreached through a process of valuation which is essentially of the same\r\nlogical character as the judgment-process whereby conclusions of\r\nphysical fact are established--in a word, that the valuation-process,\r\nissuing in the finished judgment of value expressive of the judging\r\nperson's definitive attitude toward the thing in question, is\r\nconstructive of an order of reality in the same sense as, in current\r\ntheories of knowledge, is the judgment of sense-perception and science.\r\nOur method of procedure to this end will be that of assuming, and\r\nadhering to as consistently as possible, the standpoint of the\r\nindividual in the process of deliberating upon an ethical or economic\r\nproblem (for, as we shall hold, all values properly so called are either\r\nethical or economic), and of ascertaining, as accurately as may be, the\r\nmeaning of the deliberative or evaluating process and of the various\r\nfactors in it as these are presented in the individual's apprehension.\r\nIt is in this sense that our procedure will be logical rather than\r\npsychological. We shall be concerned to determine the _meaning_ of the\r\nobject of valuation as object, of the standard of value as standard, and\r\nof the valued object as valued, in terms of the individual's own\r\napprehension of these, rather than to ascertain the nature and\r\nconditions of his apprehensions of these considered as psychical\r\nevents. Our attention will throughout be directed to these factors or\r\nphases of the valuation-process in their functional aspect of\r\ndeterminants of the valuing agent's practical attitude, and never,\r\nexcepting for purposes of incidental illustration and in a very general\r\nand tentative way, as events in consciousness mediated by more\r\n\"elementary\" psychical processes. The results which we shall gain by\r\nadhering to this method will enable us to see not merely that our\r\njudgments of value are in function and meaning objective, but also that\r\nour judgments of sense-perception and science are, as such, capable of\r\nsatisfactory interpretation only as being incidental to the attainment\r\nand progressive reconstruction of judgments of value.\r\n\r\nThe first three main divisions will be given over to establishing the\r\nobjectivity of content and function of judgments of value. The fourth\r\ndivision will present a detailed analysis of the two types of judgment\r\nof value, the ethical and economic, defining them and relating them to\r\neach other, and correlating them in the manner just suggested with\r\njudgment of the physical type. After considering, in the fifth part,\r\ncertain general objections to the positions thus stated, we shall\r\nproceed in the sixth and concluding division to define the function of\r\nthe consciousness of value in the economy of life.[107]\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe system of judgments which defines what one calls the objective order\r\nof things is inevitably unique for each particular individual. No two\r\nmen can view the world from the standpoint of the same theoretical and\r\npractical interests, nor can any two proceed in the work of gaining for\r\nthemselves knowledge of the world with precisely equal degrees of skill\r\nand accuracy. Each must be prompted and guided, in the construction of\r\nhis knowledge of single things and of the system in which they have\r\ntheir being, by his own particular interests and aims; and even when one\r\nperson in a measure shares in the interests and aims of another, the\r\nrate and manner of procedure will not be the same for both, nor will the\r\nknowledge gained be for both equally systematic in arrangement or in\r\ninterrelation of its parts. Each man lives in a world of his own--a\r\nworld, indeed, identical in certain fundamental respects with the worlds\r\nwhich his fellow-men have constructed for themselves, but one\r\nnevertheless necessarily unique through and through because each man is\r\na unique individual. There is, doubtless, a \"social currency\" of objects\r\nwhich implies a certain identity of meaning in objects as experienced by\r\ndifferent individuals. The existence of society presupposes, and its\r\nevolution in turn develops and extends, a system of generally accepted\r\nobjects and relations. Nevertheless, the \"socially current object\" is,\r\nas such, an abstraction just as the uniform social individual is\r\nlikewise an abstraction. The only concrete object ever actually known or\r\nin any wise experienced by any person is the object as constructed by\r\nthat person in accordance with his own aims and purposes, and in which\r\nthere is, therefore, a large and important share of meaning which is\r\nsignificant to no one else.\r\n\r\nIt is needless in this discussion to dwell at length upon the general\r\nprinciple of recent \"functional\" psychology, that practical ends are the\r\ncontrolling factors in the acquisition of our knowledge of objective\r\nthings. We shall take for granted the truth of the general proposition\r\nthat cognition, in whatever sphere of science or of practical life, is\r\nessentially teleological in the sense of being incidental always, more\r\nor less directly, to the attainment of ends. Cognition, as the\r\napperceptive or attentive process, is essentially the process of\r\nscrutinizing a situation (whether theoretical or practical) with a view\r\nto determining the availability for one's intended purpose of such\r\nobjects and conditions as the situation may present. The objects and\r\nconditions thus determined will be made use of or ignored, counted upon\r\nas advantageous or guarded against as unfavorable--in a word, responded\r\nto--in ways suggested by their character as ascertained through\r\nreference to the interest in question. In this sense, then, objective\r\nthings as known by individual persons are essentially complex stimuli\r\nwhose proper function and reason for being it is to elicit useful\r\nresponses in the way of conduct--responses conducive to the realization\r\nof ends.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view, then, the difference between one person's\r\nknowledge of a particular object and another's signifies (1) a\r\ndifference between these persons' original purposes in setting out to\r\ngain knowledge of the object, and (2) consequently a difference between\r\ntheir present ways of acting with reference to the object. The bare\r\nobject as socially current is, at best, for each individual simply a\r\nground upon which subsequent construction may be made; and the\r\nsubsequent construction which each individual is prompted by his\r\ncircumstances and is able to work out in judgment first makes the\r\nobject, for this individual, real and for his purposes complete.\r\n\r\nNow, it is our primary intention to show that objects are, in cases of a\r\ncertain important class, not yet ready to serve the person who knows\r\nthem in their proper character of stimuli, when they have been, even\r\nexhaustively, defined in merely physical terms. It is very often not\r\nenough that the dimensions of an object and its physical properties,\r\neven the more recondite ones as well as those more commonly\r\nunderstood--it is often not enough for the purposes of an agent that\r\nthese characters should make up the whole sum of his knowledge of the\r\nobject in question. A measure of knowledge in terms of physical\r\ncategories is often only a beginning--the result of a preliminary stage\r\nof the entire process of teleological determination, which must be\r\ncarried through before the object of attention can be satisfactorily\r\nknown. In the present study of the logic of valuation we shall be\r\noccupied exclusively with the discussion of cases of this kind. In our\r\njudgments of sense-perception and physical science we have presented to\r\nus material objects in their physical aspect. When these latter are\r\ninadequate to suggest or warrant overt conduct, our knowledge of them\r\nmust be supplemented and reconstructed in ways presently to be\r\nspecified. It is in the outcome of judgment-processes in which this work\r\nof supplementing and reconstructing is carried through that the\r\nconsciousness of value, in the proper sense, arises, and these\r\nprocesses, then, are those which we shall here consider under the name\r\nof \"processes of valuation.\" They will therefore best be approached\r\nthrough specification of the ways in which our physical judgments may be\r\ninadequate.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, assume, as has been indicated, that the process of\r\nacquiring knowledge--that is to say, the process of judgment or\r\nattention--is in every case of its occurrence incidental to the\r\nattainment of an end. We must make this assumption without attempting\r\nformally to justify it--though in the course of our discussion it will\r\nbe abundantly illustrated. Let us, in accordance with this view, think\r\nof the typical judgment-process as proceeding, in the main, as follows:\r\nFirst of all must come a sense of need or deficiency, which may, on\r\noccasion, be preceded by a more or less violent and sudden shock to the\r\nsenses, forcibly turning one's attention to the need of immediate\r\naction. By degrees this sense of need will grow more definite and come\r\nto express itself in a more or less \"clear and distinct\" image of an\r\nend, toward which end the agent is drawn by desire and to which he looks\r\nwith much or little of emotion. The emergence of the end into\r\nconsciousness immediately makes possible and occasions definite analysis\r\nof the situation in which the end must be worked out. Salient features\r\nof the situation forthwith are noticed--whether useful things or\r\nfavoring conditions, or, on the other hand, the absence of any such.\r\nThus predicates and then subjects for many subsidiary judgments in the\r\ncomprehensive judgment-process emerge together in action and interaction\r\nupon each other. The predicates, developed out of the general end toward\r\nwhich the agent strives, afford successive points of view for\r\nfresh analyses of the situation. The logical subjects thus\r\ndiscovered--_objects_ of attention and knowledge--require, on\r\nthe other hand, as they are scrutinized and judged, modification and\r\nre-examination of the end. The end grows clearer and fuller of detail\r\nas the predicates or implied (\"constituent\") ideas which are developed\r\nout of it are distinguished from each other and used in making one's\r\ninventory of the objective situation. Conversely, the situation loses\r\nits first aspect of confusion and takes on more and more the aspect of\r\nan orderly assemblage of objects and conditions, useful, indifferent,\r\nand adverse, by means of which the end may in greater or less measure be\r\nattained or must, in however greatly modified a form, be defeated. Now,\r\nin this development of the judgment-process, it must be observed, the\r\nend must be more or less clearly and consistently conceived throughout\r\nas an _activity_, if the objective means of action which have been\r\ndetermined in the process are not to be, at the last, separate and\r\nunrelated data still requiring co-ordination. If the end has been so\r\nconceived, the means will inevitably be known as members of a mechanical\r\n_system_, since the predicates by which they have been determined have\r\nat every point involved this factor of amenability to co-ordination.\r\nThe judgment-process, if properly conducted and brought to a conclusion,\r\nmust issue at the end in the functional unity of a finished plan of\r\nconduct with a perfected mechanical co-ordination of the available\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nWe have now to see that much more may be involved in such a process as\r\nthis than has been explicitly stated in our brief analysis. For the end\r\nitself may be a matter of deliberation, just as must be the physical\r\nmeans of accomplishing it; and, again, the means may call for scrutiny\r\nand determination from other points of view than the physical and\r\nmechanical. The final action taken at the end may express the outcome of\r\ndeliberate ethical and economic judgment as well as of judgments in the\r\nsphere of sense-perception and physical science. Let us consider, for\r\nexample, that one's end is the construction of a house upon a certain\r\nplot of ground. This end expresses the felt need of a more comfortable\r\nor more reputable abode, and has so much of general presumption in its\r\nfavor. There may, however, be many reasons for hesitation. The cost in\r\ntime or money or materials on hand may tax one's resources and\r\ninjuriously curtail one's activities along other lines. And there may be\r\nethical reasons why the plan should not be carried out. The house may\r\nshut off a pleasing prospect from the view of the entire neighborhood\r\nand serve no better end than the gratification of its owner's selfish\r\nvanity. It will cost a sum of money which might be used in paying just,\r\nthough outlawed, debts.\r\n\r\nNow, from the standpoint of such problems as these the fullest possible\r\npreliminary knowledge of the physical and mechanical fitness of our\r\nmeans must still be very abstract and general. It would be of use in any\r\nundertaking like the one we have supposed, but it is not sufficient in\r\nso far as the problem is one's own problem, concrete, particular, and\r\nso unique. One may, of course, proceed to the stage of physical\r\njudgment without having settled the ethical problems which may have\r\npresented themselves at the outset. The end may be entertained\r\ntentatively as a hypothesis until certain mechanical problems have been\r\ndealt with. But manifestly this is only postponement of the issue. The\r\nagent is still quite unprepared, even after the means have been so far\r\ndetermined, to take the first step in the execution of the plan; indeed,\r\nhis uncertainty is probably only the more harassing than before.\r\nMoreover, the economic problems in the case are now more sharply\r\ndefined, and these for the time being still further darken counsel.\r\nManifestly the need for deliberation is at this point quite as urgent as\r\nthe need for physical determination can ever be, and the need is\r\nevidenced in the same way by the actual arrest and postponement of overt\r\nconduct. The agent, despite his physical knowledge, is not yet free to\r\nembrace the end and, having done so, use thereto the means at his\r\ndisposal. It is plainly impossible to use the physical means until one\r\nknows in terms of Substance and Attribute or Cause and Effect, or\r\nwhatever other physical categories one may please, what manner of\r\nbehavior may be expected of them. So likewise is it as truly impossible,\r\nfor one intellectually and morally capable of appreciating problems of a\r\nmore advanced and complex sort, to exploit the physical properties thus\r\ndiscovered until ethical determination of the end and economic\r\ndetermination of the means have been completed.[108]\r\n\r\nThere are, then, we conclude, cases in which physical determination of\r\nthe means is by itself not a sufficient preparation for conduct--in\r\nwhich there are ethical and economic problems which delay the\r\napplication of the physical means to the end to which they may be\r\nphysically adapted. Indeed, so much as this may well appear as\r\nsufficiently obvious without extended illustration. Everyone knows that\r\nit is nearly always necessary, in undertaking any work in which material\r\nthings are used as means, to count the cost; and everyone knows likewise\r\nthat not every end that is in any way attractive and within one's reach\r\nmay without more ado be taken as an object of settled desire and effort.\r\nIt is indeed needless to elaborate these commonplaces in the sense in\r\nwhich they are commonly understood. However, such is not our present\r\npurpose. Our purpose is the more specific one of showing that the\r\nmeaning of Objectivity must be widened so as to include (1) the\r\n\"universe\" of ends in their ethical aspect and (2) the economic aspect\r\nof the means of action, as well as (3) the physical aspect to which the\r\ncharacter of Objectivity is commonly restricted. We shall maintain that\r\nthese are parts or phases of a complete conception of Reality, and that\r\nof them, consequently, Objectivity must be predicated for every\r\nessential reason connoted by such characterization of the world of\r\nthings \"external\" to the senses. It has been with this conclusion in\r\nmind, then, that we have sought to emphasize the frequent serious\r\ninadequacy, for practical purposes, of the merely physical determination\r\nof the means in one's environment.\r\n\r\nThe principle thus suggested would imply that the ethical and economic\r\nstages in the one inclusive process of reflective attention should be\r\nregarded as involving, when they occur, the same logical function of\r\njudgment as is operative in the sphere of sense-perception and the\r\nsciences generally. Ethical and economic factors must on occasion be\r\npresent at the final choice and shaping of one's course of conduct,\r\nalong with the physical determinations of environing means and\r\nconditions which one has made in sense-perception. There is, then, it\r\nwould appear, at least a fair presumption, though not indeed an _a\r\npriori_ certainty, that these ethical and economic factors or conditions\r\nhave, like the physical, taken form in a _judgment-process_ which will\r\nadmit of profitable analysis in accordance with whatever general theory\r\nof judgment one may hold as valid elsewhere in the field of knowledge.\r\nThis presumption we shall seek to verify. Now, our interest in thus\r\ndetermining, first of all, the logical character of these processes will\r\nreadily be understood from this, that, in the present view, these are\r\nthe processes, and the only ones in our experience, which are properly\r\nto be regarded as processes of Valuation. We shall hold that Valuation,\r\nand so all consciousness of Value, properly so called, must be either\r\nethical or economic; that the only conscious processes in which Values\r\ncan come to definition are these processes of ethical and economic\r\njudgment. The present theory of Value is, then, essentially a logical\r\none, in the sense of holding that Values are determined in and by a\r\nlogical--that is, a judgmental--valuation-process and in its details is\r\nclosely dependent upon the general conception of judgment of which the\r\noutlines have been sketched above. Accordingly, the exposition must\r\nproceed in the following general order: Assuming the conception of\r\njudgment which has been presented (which our discussion will in several\r\nways further illustrate and so tend to confirm), we shall seek to show\r\nthat the determinations made in ethical and economic judgment are in the\r\nproper sense objective. This will involve, first of all, a statement of\r\nthe conditions under which the ethical and economic judgments\r\nrespectively arise--which statement will serve to distinguish the two\r\ntypes of judgment from each other. We shall then proceed to the special\r\nanalysis of the ethical and economic forms from the standpoint of our\r\ngeneral theory of judgment, thereby establishing in detail the\r\njudgmental character of these parts of the reflective process. This\r\nanalysis will serve to introduce our interpretation of the consciousness\r\nof Value as a factor in the conduct and economy of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLet us then define the problem of the objective reference of the\r\nvaluational judgments by stating, as distinctly as may be, the\r\nconditions by which ethical and economic deliberation, respectively, are\r\nprompted. A study of these conditions will make it easier to see in what\r\nway the judgments reached in dealing with them can be objective.\r\n\r\nWhen will an end, presenting itself in consciousness in the manner\r\nindicated in our brief analysis of the judgment-process, become the\r\ncenter of attention, thereby checking the advance, through investigation\r\nof the possible means, to final overt action? This is the general\r\nstatement of the problem of the typical ethical situation. Manifestly\r\nthere will be no ethical deliberation if the imaged end at once turns\r\nthe attention toward the environment of possible means, instead of first\r\nof all itself becoming the object instead of the director of attention;\r\nthere will be no suspension of progress toward final action, excepting\r\nsuch as may later come through difficulty in the discovery and\r\nco-ordination of the means. However, there are cases in which the\r\nemergence of the end forthwith is followed by a check to the reflective\r\nprocess, and the agent shrinks from the end presented in imagination as\r\nbeing, let us say, one forbidden by authority or one repugnant to his\r\nown established standards. The end may in such a case disappear at once;\r\nvery often it will insistently remain. On this latter supposition, the\r\nsimplest possibility will be the development of a mere mechanical\r\ntension, a \"pull and haul\" between the end, or properly the impulses\r\nwhich it represents, and the agent's habit of suppressing impulses of\r\nthe class to which the present one is, perhaps intuitively, recognized\r\nas belonging. The case is the common one of \"temptation\" on the one side\r\nand \"principle\" or \"conscience\" on the other, and so long as the two\r\nforces remain thus in hard-and-fast opposition to each other there can\r\nbe no ethical deliberation or judgment in a proper sense. The standard\r\nor habit may gain the day by sheer mechanical excess of power, or the\r\nnew impulse, the temptation, may prevail because its onset can break\r\ndown the mechanical resistance.\r\n\r\nOut of such a situation as this, however, genuine ethical deliberation\r\nmay arise on condition that standard and \"temptation\" can lose something\r\nof their abstractness and their hard-and-fast opposition, and develop\r\ninto terms of concrete meaning. The agent may come to see that the end\r\nis in some definite way of really vital interest and too important to be\r\nput aside without consideration. He may, of course, in this fall into\r\ngross self-sophistication, like the drunkard in the classical instance\r\nwho takes another glass to test his self-control and thereby gain\r\nassurance, or he may act with wisdom and with full sincerity, like\r\nDorothea Casaubon when she renounced the impossible task imposed by her\r\ndeparted husband. In the moral life one can ask or hope for complete\r\nexemption from the risk of self-deception with as little reason as in\r\nscientific research. But however this may be, our present interest is in\r\nthe method, not in particular results of ethical reflection. Whether\r\nproperly so in a particular case or not, the imaged end may come to\r\nseem at least plausibly defensible on grounds of principle which serve\r\nto sanction certain other modes of conduct to which a place is given in\r\nthe accepted scheme of life; or the end may simply press for a\r\nrelatively independent recognition on the very general ground that its\r\nemergence represents an enlargement and new development of the\r\npersonality.[109] The end may thus cease to stand in the character of\r\nblind self-assertive impulse, and press its claim as a positive means of\r\nfuture moral growth, as bringing freedom from repressive and enfeebling\r\nrestraints and as tending to the reinforcement of other already valued\r\nmodes of conduct. On the other hand, the standard will cease to stand as\r\nmere resistance and negation, and may discover something of its hidden\r\nmeaning as a product of long experience and slow growth, and as perhaps\r\na vital part of the organization of one's present life, not to be\r\ntouched without grave risk.\r\n\r\nNow, on whichever side the development may first commence, a like\r\ndevelopment must soon follow on the other, and it is the action and\r\nreaction of standard and prospective or problematic end upon each other\r\nthat constitutes the process of ethical deliberation or judgment. Just\r\nas in the typical judgment-process, as sketched above, so also here\r\npredicate and subject _develop each other_, when once they have given\r\nover their first antagonism and come to the attitude of reasoning\r\ntogether. The predicate explains itself that the subject or new end may\r\nbe searchingly and fairly tested; and under this scrutiny the subject\r\ndevelops its full meaning as a course of conduct, thereby prompting\r\nfurther analysis and reinterpretation of the standard. But this is not\r\nthe place for detailed analysis of the process;[110] here we are\r\nconcerned only to define the type of situation, and this we may now do\r\nin the following terms: The indispensable condition of ethical judgment\r\nis the presence in the agent's mind of at least two rival interesting\r\nends or systems of such ends. In the foregoing, the subject of the\r\njudgment is the new end that has arisen; the predicate or \"standard\" is\r\nthe symbol for the old ends or values which in the tension of the\r\njudgment-process must be brought to more or less explicit\r\nenumeration--and, we must add, reconstruction also. Indeed, it is\r\nimportant, even at this stage of our discussion, to observe that\r\nPredicate and Standard are not equivalent in meaning. The predicate, or\r\npredicative side, of judgment is the imagery of control in the process,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, develops with the subject side; while the term\r\n\"Standard\" connotes the rigid fixity which belongs to the inhibiting\r\nconcept or ideal in the stage before the judgment-process proper can\r\nbegin. The ethical judgment-process is, in a word, just the process of\r\nreconstructing standards--as in its other and corresponding aspect it is\r\nthe process of interpreting new ends. Those who oppose measures of\r\nsocial reform or new modes of conduct or belief on alleged grounds of\r\n\"immorality\" instinctively feel in doing so that the change may make its\r\nway more easily against a resistance that will candidly explain itself;\r\nand, on the other side of the social judgment-process, the more\r\nfanatical know how to turn to good advantage for their propaganda the\r\nbitterness or contempt of those who represent the established order. On\r\nboth sides there are those who trust more in mechanical \"pull and haul\"\r\nthan in the intrinsic merits of their cause.\r\n\r\nThus it is by encountering some rival end or entire system of ends, as\r\nsymbolized by an ideal, that a new end emerging out of impulse comes to\r\nstand for an agent, as the center of a problem of conduct, and so to\r\noccupy the center of attention. And it thereby becomes an Object, as we\r\nshall hold, which must be more fully defined in order that it may be\r\n_valued_, and accordingly be held to warrant a determinate attitude\r\ntoward itself on the agent's part. We have now to define in the same\r\ngeneral terms the typical economic situation.\r\n\r\nIn economic theory as in common thought it is not the contemplated act\r\nof applying certain means to the attainment of an end regarded as\r\ndesirable that functions as the logical subject of valuation. The thing\r\nor object valued in the economic situation is one's present wealth,\r\nwhether material or immaterial, one's services or labor--whatever one\r\ngives in exchange or otherwise sets apart for the attainment of a\r\ndesired end or, proximately, to secure possession of the necessary and\r\nsufficient means to the attainment of a desired end. The object of\r\nattention in the valuing process is here not itself an end of action. In\r\nthis respect the economic type of judgment is like the physical, for in\r\nboth the object to be valued is a certain means which one is seeking to\r\nadapt to some more or less definitely imaged purpose; or a condition of\r\nwhich one wishes, likewise for some special purpose, to take advantage.\r\nThe ultimate goal of all judgment is the determination of a course of\r\nconduct looking toward an end, and our present problem may accordingly\r\nbe stated in the following terms: Under what circumstances in the\r\njudgment-process does it become necessary to the definition and\r\nattainment of an end as yet vague and indeterminate that the requisite\r\nmeans, as in part already physically determined, should be further\r\nscrutinized in attention and determined from the economic point of view?\r\nOr, in a word: What is the \"jurisdiction\" of the economic point of view?\r\n\r\nFor ordinary judgements of sense-perception the presence in\r\nconsciousness of a single unquestioned end is the adequate occasion, as\r\nour analysis (assuming its validity) has shown. For ethical judgment we\r\nhave seen that the presence of conflicting ends is necessary; and we\r\nshall now hold that this condition is necessary, though not, without a\r\ncertain qualification, adequate, for the economic type as well. If an\r\nimaged end can hold its place in consciousness without a rival, and the\r\nphysical means of attaining it have been found and co-ordinated, then\r\nthe use or consumption of the means must inevitably follow, without\r\neither ethical or economic judgement; for, to paraphrase the saying of\r\nProfessor James, nothing but an end can displace or inhibit effort\r\ntoward another end. The economic situation differs, then, from the\r\nethical in this, that the end or system of ends entering into\r\ncompetition with the one for the time being of chief and primary\r\ninterest has been brought to consciousness through reference to those\r\n\"physical\" means which already have been determined as necessary to this\r\nlatter end. The conflict of ends in the economic situation, that is to\r\nsay, is not due to a direct and intrinsic incompatibility between them.\r\nWhere there manifestly is such incompatibility, judgment will be of the\r\nethical type--as when building the house involves the foreclosure of a\r\nmortgage, and so, in working an injury to the holder of the site, may do\r\nviolence to one's ideal of friendship or of more special obligation; or\r\nwhen an impulse to intemperate self-indulgence is met by one's ideal of\r\nsocial usefulness. In cases such as these one clearly sees, or can on\r\nreflection come to see, in what way an evil result to personal character\r\nwill follow upon the imminent misdeed, and in what way suppression of\r\nthe momentary impulse will conserve the entire approved and established\r\nway of life. Very often, however, the conflicting ends are related in no\r\nsuch mutually exclusive way. Each may be in itself permissible and\r\ncompatible with the other, and, so far as any possible ethical\r\ndiscrimination can determine, there is no ground for choice between\r\nthem. Thus it is only through the fact that both ends are dependent\r\nupon a limited supply of means that one would, for example, ever bring\r\ntogether and deliberately oppose in judgment the purpose of making\r\nadditions to his library and the necessity of providing a store of fuel\r\nfor the winter. Both ends in such a case are in themselves indeed\r\npermissible in a general way, but they may very well not both of them be\r\neconomically possible, and hence, for the person in question and in the\r\npresence of the economic conditions which confront him, not, in the last\r\nanalysis, both ethically possible. When there is a conflict between two\r\nends that stand in close organic relation in the sense explained above,\r\nthe problem is an ethical one; when the conflict is, in the sense\r\nexplained, one of competition between ends ethically permissible--not at\r\nvariance, either one, that is, with other ends _directly_--for the whole\r\nor for a share of one's supply of means, the problem is of the economic\r\ntype.[111]\r\n\r\nThere are three typical cases in which economic judgment or valuation of\r\nthe means is necessary, and the enumeration of these will make clear the\r\nrelation between the ethical and the economic types of judgment: (1)\r\nFirst may be mentioned the case in which ethical deliberation has\r\napparently reached its end in the formation of a plan of action which,\r\nso far as one can see, on ethical grounds is unobjectionable. A definite\r\n\"temptation\" may have been overcome, or out of a more complex situation\r\na satisfactory ethical compromise or readjustment may have been\r\ndeveloped with much difficulty. Now, there are very often cases in which\r\nsuch a course of action still may not be entered on without further\r\nhesitation; for, if the plan be one requiring for its working out the\r\nuse of material means, the fact of an existing limitation of one's\r\nsupply of means must bring hitherto unthought of ends into conflict with\r\nit. There are doubtless many situations in which one's moral choice may\r\nbe carried into practice without consideration of ways and means, as\r\nwhen one forgives an injury or holds his instinctive nature under\r\ndiscipline in the effort to attain an ascetic or a genuinely social\r\nideal of character. But more often than the moral rigorist cares to see,\r\nquestions of an economic nature must be raised after the ethical\r\n\"evidence is all in\"--questions which are probably more trying to a\r\nsensitive moral nature than those more dramatic situations in which the\r\nreal perils of self-sophistication are vastly less, and the simpler,\r\nsharper definition of the issue makes possible a less difficult, though\r\na more decisive and edifying, victory. (2) In the second place are those\r\ncases in which the end that has emerged is without conspicuous moral\r\nquality, because, although it may represent some worthy impulse, it has\r\nnot been obliged to make its way to acceptance against the resistance of\r\ndesires less worthy than itself. This is the ideal case of economic\r\ntheory in which \"moral distinctions are irrelevant,\" and the economic\r\nman is free, according to the myth, to perform his hedonistic\r\ncalculations without thought of moral scruple. The end ethically\r\nacceptable in itself, like the enriching of one's library, must, when\r\nthe means are limited, divert a portion of the means from other uses,\r\nand will thus, _through reference to the indispensable means_, engage in\r\nconflict with other ends quite remotely, if in the agent's knowledge at\r\nall, related with itself. (3) Finally we reach the limit of apparent\r\nfreedom from ethical considerations in the operations of business\r\ninstitutions, and perhaps especially in those of large business\r\ncorporations. Apart from the routine operations of a business which\r\ninvolve no present exercise of the valuing judgment, there are\r\nconstantly in such institutions new projects which must be considered,\r\nand which commonly must involve revaluation of the means. In this\r\nrevaluation the principle of greatest revenue is supposed to be the sole\r\ncriterion, regardless of other personal or social points of view from\r\nwhich confessedly the measure might be considered. But such a\r\nsupposition, however true to the facts of current business practice it\r\nmay be, we must hold to be an abstraction when viewed from the\r\nstandpoint of the social life at large, and hence no real exception to\r\nour general principle. The economic and the ethical situations differ,\r\nas types, only in the closeness of relation between the ends that are in\r\nconflict and in the manner in which the ends are first brought into\r\nconflict--not in respect of the intrinsic nature of the ends which are\r\ninvolved in them.[112] It is this difference which, as we shall see,\r\nexplains why ethical valuation must be of ends, and economic valuation,\r\non the other hand, of means.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to see _in what way_ valuation of the means of action can\r\nserve to resolve a difficulty of the type which has thus been designated\r\nas Economic. The question must be deferred until a more detailed\r\nanalysis of the economic judgment-process can be undertaken. It is\r\nenough for our present purpose to note that the subject of valuation in\r\nthis process _is_ the means, and to see that under the typical\r\nconditions which have been described some further determination of the\r\nmeans than the merely physical one of their factual availability for the\r\ncompeting ends is needed.[113] Physically and mechanically the means are\r\navailable for each one of the ends or groups of ends in question; the\r\npressing problem is to determine for which one of the ends, if any, or\r\nto what compromise or readjustment of certain of the ends or all of\r\nthem, the means at hand are in an economic sense most properly\r\navailable.[114]\r\n\r\nFrom this preliminary discussion of the ethical and economic situations\r\nwe must now pass to discuss the objectivity of the judgments by which\r\nthe agent meets the difficulties which such situations as these present.\r\nWe shall seek to show that these judgments are constructive of an\r\nobjective order of reality. It will be necessary in the first place to\r\ndetermine the psychological conditions of the more commonly recognized\r\nexperience of Objectivity in the restricted sphere of sense-perception.\r\nThere might otherwise remain a certain antecedent presumption against\r\nthe thesis which we wish to establish even after the direct argument had\r\nbeen presented.[115]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCommon-sense and natural science certainly tend to identify the\r\nobjectively real with the existent in space and time. The physical\r\nuniverse is held to be palpably real in a way in which nothing not\r\npresented in sensuous terms can be. To most minds doubtless it is\r\ndifficult to understand why Plato should have ascribed to the Ideas a\r\nhigher degree of reality than that possessed by the particular objects\r\nof sense-perception, and still more difficult to understand his\r\nascription of real existence to such Ideas as those of Beauty, Justice,\r\nand the Good. There is a certain apparent stability in a universe\r\npresented in \"immediate\" sense-perception--a universe with which we are\r\nin constant bodily intercourse--that seems not to belong to a mere\r\norder of relations which, if known in any sense, is not known to us\r\nthrough the senses. Moreover, knowledge of the physical world is felt to\r\npossess a higher degree of certainty than does any knowledge we can have\r\nof supposed economic or moral truth, or of economic or moral standards.\r\nOf such knowledge one is disposed to say, as Mr. Spencer does of\r\nmetaphysics, that at the best it presupposes a long and elaborate\r\ninferential process which, as long, is likely to be faulty; whereas\r\nphysical truth is immediate or else, when inference is involved in it,\r\neasy to be tested by appeal to immediate facts. Physical reality is a\r\nreality that can be seen and handled and felt as offering resistance,\r\nand this is evidence of objectivity of a sort not to be found in other\r\nspheres of knowledge for which the like claim is made.\r\n\r\nThe force of these impressions (and it would not be difficult to find\r\nstronger statements in the history of scientific and ethical nominalism)\r\ndiminishes if one tries to determine in what consists that objectivity\r\nwhich they uncritically assume as given in sense-perception. For one\r\nmust recognize that not all our possible modes of sense-experience are\r\nequally concerned in the presentation of this perceived objective world.\r\nCertain sensory \"quales\" are immediately referred to outward objects as\r\nbelonging to them. Certain others are, in a way, \"inward,\" either not\r\nmore definitely localized at all or merely localized in the sense-organ\r\nwhich mediates them. Now, the reason for this difference cannot lie in\r\nthe content of the various sense-qualities abstractly taken. A visual\r\nsensation, apart from the setting in which it occurs in common\r\nexperience, can be no more objective in its reference--indeed, can have\r\nno more reference of any kind--than the least definite and instructive\r\norganic sensation. For the degree of distinctness with which one\r\ndiscriminates sense-qualities depends upon the number and importance of\r\nthe interpretative associations which it is important from time to time\r\nto \"connect\" with them; or, conversely, the sense-qualities are not\r\n_self_-discriminating in virtue of an intrinsic objective reference or\r\nmeaning which each possesses and which drives it apart from all the\r\nrest. Indeed, an intrinsic meaning, if a sensation could possess one,\r\nwould not only be superfluous in the development of knowledge, but, as\r\nlikely to be mistaken for the acquired or functional meaning, even\r\nseriously confusing.[116]\r\n\r\nNow, it must be granted that, if the \"simple idea of sensation\" is\r\nwithout objective reference, no association with it of similarly\r\nabstract sensations can supply the lack. A \"movement\" sensation, or a\r\ntactual, having in itself no such meaning, cannot merely by being\r\n\"associated\" with a similarly meaningless visual sensation endow this\r\nlatter with reference to an object. Objective reference is, in fact, not\r\na sensuous thing; it is not a conscious \"element,\" nor does it arise\r\nfrom any combination or fusion of such. It is neither _in_ the\r\nassociation of ideas as a constituent member, nor does it belong to the\r\nassociation considered as a sequence of psychical states. Instead, in\r\nour present view, it belongs to or arises out of the activity through\r\nwhich and with reference to which associations are first of all\r\nestablished. It is an aspect or kind of reference or category under\r\nwhich any sense-quality or datum is apperceived when it is held apart\r\nfrom the stream of consciousness in order that it may receive new\r\nmeaning as a stimulus; and a sensation functioning in such a \"state of\r\nconsciousness\"[117] is a psychical phenomenon very different from the\r\nconscious element of \"analytical\" psychology. The extent to which it is\r\ntrue that the objective world of sense-perception is pre-eminently\r\nvisual and tactual is then merely an evidence of the extent to which the\r\nexigencies of the life-process have required finer sense-discrimination\r\nfor the sake of more refined reaction within these spheres as compared\r\nwith others. Our conclusion, then, must be that the consciousness of\r\nobjectivity is not as such sensuous, even as given in our perception of\r\nthe material world. The world, as viewed from the standpoint of a\r\nparticular, practical emergency, is an objective world, not in virtue of\r\nits having a \"sensuous\" or a \"material\" aspect as something existent\r\n_per se_, but because it is a world of stimuli in course of definition\r\nfor the guidance of activity.[118]\r\n\r\nIt will be well to give further positive exposition of the meaning of\r\nthe view thus stated. To return once more to our fundamental\r\npsychological conception, knowledge is essentially relevant to the\r\nsolution of particular problems of more or less urgency and of various\r\nkinds and figures in the solution of such problems as the assemblage of\r\nconsciously recognized symbols or stimuli by which various actions are\r\nsuggested. The object as known is therefore not the same as the object\r\nas apprehended in other possible modes of being conscious of it. The\r\nworkman who is actually using his tool in shaping his material, or the\r\nwarrior who is actually using his weapon in the thick of combat, is, if\r\nconscious of these objects at all (and doubtless he may be conscious of\r\nthem at such times), not conscious of them _as objects_--as the one\r\nmight be, for example, in adjusting the tool for a particular kind of\r\nuse, and the other in giving a keen edge to his blade. Under these\r\nlatter circumstances the tool or weapon is an _object_, and its observed\r\ncondition, viewed in the light of a purpose of using the object in a\r\ncertain way, is regarded as properly suggesting certain changes or\r\nimprovements. And likewise will the tool or the weapon have an objective\r\ncharacter in the agent's apprehension in the moment of identifying and\r\nselecting it from among a number of others, or even in the act of\r\nreaching for it, especially if it is inconveniently placed. But in the\r\nact of freely using one's objective means the category of the objective\r\nplays no part in consciousness, because at such times there is no\r\njudgment respecting the means--because there is no sufficient occasion\r\nfor the isolation of certain conscious elements from the rest of the\r\nstream of conscious experience to be defined as stimuli to certain\r\nneeded responses. Such isolation will not normally take place so long as\r\nthe reactions suggested by the conscious contents involved in the\r\nexperience are fully adequate to the situation. Objects are not normally\r\nheld apart as such from the stream of consciousness in which they are\r\npresented and recognized as possessing qualities warranting certain\r\nmodes of conduct, excepting as it has become necessary to the attainment\r\nof the agent's purposes to modify or reconstruct his activity.[119]\r\n\r\nAre things, then, apprehended as objective in virtue of the agent's\r\nattitude toward them, or is the agent's attitude in a typical case\r\ngrounded upon an antecedent determination of the objectivity of the\r\nthings in question? We must answer, in the first place, that there can\r\nbe no such antecedent determination. We may, it is true, speak of\r\nbelieving, on the evidence of sight or touch, that a certain object is\r\nreally present before us. But neither sight nor touch possesses in\r\nitself, as a particular sense-quality, any objective meaning. If touch\r\nis _par excellence_ the sense of the objective and the appeal to touch\r\nthe test of objectivity, this can only be because touch is the sense\r\nmost closely and intimately connected in our experience with action.\r\nAfter any interval of hesitation and judgment, action begins with\r\ncontact with and manipulation of the physical means which have been\r\nunder investigation. Not only is touch the proximate stimulus and guide\r\nto manipulation, but all relevant knowledge which has been gained in any\r\njudgment-process, through the other senses, and especially through\r\nsight, must ultimately be reducible to terms of touch or other contact\r\nsense. The alleged tactual evidence of objectivity is, then, rather a\r\nconfirmation than a difficulty for our present view. In short, we must\r\ndismiss as impossible the hypothesis that there can be a consciousness\r\nof objectivity which is not dependent upon and an expression of primary\r\nantecedent tendencies toward motor response to the presented stimulus.\r\nIt is our attitude toward the prospective stimulus that mediates the\r\nconsciousness of an object standing over against us.\r\n\r\nSo far, indeed, is it from being true that objectivity is a matter for\r\nspecial determination antecedently to action that by common testimony\r\nthe conviction of objectivity comes to us quite irresistibly. The object\r\nforces itself upon us, as we say, and \"whether we will or no\" we must\r\nrecognize its presence there before us and its independence of any\r\nchoice of ours or of our knowledge. In the cautious manipulation of an\r\ninstrument, in the laborious shaping of some refractory material, in the\r\nperformance of any delicate or difficult task, one's sense of the\r\nobjectivity of the thing with which one works is as obtrusive as remorse\r\nor grief, and as little to be shaken off. We shall revert to this\r\nsuggested analogy at a later stage in our discussion.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to define more precisely the nature of the\r\nconditions in which the sense of objectivity emerges, and this will\r\nbring us to the point at which the objective import of our economic and\r\nethical judgments can profitably be discussed. We have said that the\r\nworld of the physical is objective, not in virtue of the sensuous terms\r\nin which it is presented, but because it is a world of stimuli for the\r\nguidance of human conduct. Under what circumstances, then, are we\r\nconscious of stimuli in their capacity of guides or incentives or\r\ngrounds of conduct? And the answer must be that stimuli are interpreted\r\nas such, and so take on the character of objectivity, when their precise\r\ncharacter as stimuli is still in doubt, and they must therefore receive\r\nfurther definition.\r\n\r\nFor example, a man pursued by a wild beast must find some means of\r\nescape or defense, and, seeing a tree which he may climb or a stone\r\nwhich he may hurl, will inspect these as well as may be with reference\r\nto their fitness for the intended purpose. It is at just such moments as\r\nthese, then, that physical things become things for knowledge and take\r\non their stubbornly objective character--that is to say, when they are\r\nessentially problematic. Now, in order that any physical thing may be\r\nthus problematic and so possess objective character for knowledge, it\r\nmust (1) be in part understood, and so prompt certain more or less\r\nindiscriminate responses; and (2) be in part as yet not understood--in\r\nsuch wise that, while there are certain indefinite or unmeasured\r\ntendencies on the agent's part to respond to the object--climb the tree\r\nor hurl the stone--there is also a certain failure of complete unity in\r\nthe co-ordination of these activities, a certain contradiction between\r\ndifferent suggestions of conduct which different observed qualities of\r\nthe tree or stone may give, and so hesitation and arrest of final\r\naction. The pursued man views the tree suspiciously before trusting\r\nhimself to its doubtful strength, or weighs well the stone and tests its\r\nrough edges before pausing to throw it. Thus, to state the matter\r\nnegatively, there are two possible situations in which the sense of\r\nobjectivity, if it emerge into consciousness at all, cannot long\r\ncontinue. An object---as, for example, some strange shrub or\r\nflower--which, in the case we are supposing, may attract the pursued\r\nwayfarer's notice, may awaken no responses relevant to the emergency in\r\nwhich the agent finds himself; and it will therefore forthwith lapse\r\nfrom consciousness. Or, on the other hand, the object, as the tree or\r\nstone, may rightly or wrongly seem to the agent so completely\r\nsatisfactory, or, rather, in effect may _be_ so, as instantly to prompt\r\nthe action which otherwise would come, if at all, only after a period of\r\nmore or less prolonged attention. In neither of these cases, then, is\r\nthere a problematic object. In the one the thing in question is wholly\r\napart from any present interest, and therefore lapses. In the other case\r\nthe thing seen is comprehended on the instant with reference to its\r\ngeneral use and merges immediately into the main stream of the agent's\r\nconsciousness without having been an object of express attention. In\r\nneither case, therefore, is there hesitation with reference to the\r\nthing in question--any conflict between inconsiderate positive responses\r\nprompted by certain features of the object and inhibitions due to\r\nrecognition of its shortcomings. In a word, in neither case is there any\r\njudgment or possibility of judgment, and hence no sense of objectivity.\r\nWe can have consciousness of an object, in the strict sense of the term,\r\nonly when some part or general aspect of the total situation confronting\r\nan agent excites or seems to warrant responses which must be held in\r\ncheck for further determination. In terms of consciousness, an object is\r\nalways an object of attention--that is, an object which is under process\r\nof development and reconstruction with reference to an end.\r\n\r\nAn inhibited impulse to react in a more or less definite way to a\r\nstimulus is, then, the adequate condition of the emergence in\r\nconsciousness of the sense of objectivity. So long as an activity is\r\nproceeding without check or interruption, and no conflict develops\r\nbetween motor responses prompted by different parts or aspects of the\r\nsituation, the agent's consciousness will not present the distinction of\r\nObjective and Subjective. The mode of being conscious which accompanies\r\nfree and harmonious activity of this sort may be exemplified by such\r\nexperiences as æsthetic appreciation, sensuous enjoyment, acquiescent\r\nabsorption in pleasurable emotion, or even intellectual processes of the\r\nmechanical sort, such as easy computation or the solution of simple\r\nalgebraic problems--processes in which no more serious difficulty is\r\nencountered than suffices to stimulate a moderate degree of interest.\r\nIf, however, reverting to the illustration, our present need for a stone\r\ncalls for some property which the stone we have seized appears to lack,\r\nconsciousness must pass over into the reflective or attentive phase. The\r\nstone will now figure as an _object_ possessing certain qualities which\r\nrender it in a general way relevant to the emergency before us. A\r\nneeded quality is missing, and this defect must hold in check all the\r\nimminent responses until discovery of the missing quality can set them\r\nfree. In a word, the stone as known to us has assumed the station of\r\nsubject in a judgment-process, and our effort is, if possible, to assign\r\nto it a new predicate relevant to our present situation. Psychologically\r\nspeaking, the stone is an object, a stimulus to which we are endeavoring\r\nto find warrant for responding in some new or reconstructed way.\r\n\r\nIn this process we must assume, then, first of all, an interest on the\r\nagent's part in the situation as a whole, which in the first place, in\r\nterms of the illustration, makes the pursued one note the tree or\r\nstone--which might otherwise have escaped his notice as completely as\r\nany passing cloud or falling leaf--and suggests what particular\r\nqualities or adaptabilities should be looked for in it. Given this\r\ninterest in \"making something\" out of the total situation as explaining\r\nthe recognition of the stone and the impulse to seize and hurl it, we\r\nfind the sense of the stone's objectivity emerging just in the arrest of\r\nthe undiscriminating impulse. The stone must have a certain meaning as a\r\nstimulus first of all, but it must be a meaning not yet quite defined\r\nand certain of acceptance. The stone will be an _object_ only if, and so\r\nlong as, the undiscriminating impulses suggested by these elements of\r\nmeaning are held in check in order that they may be ordered,\r\nsupplemented, or made more definite. It is, then, the essence of the\r\npresent contention that physical things are _objective_ in our\r\nexperience in virtue of their recognized inadequacy as means or\r\nincentives of action--an inadequacy which, in turn, is felt as such in\r\nso far as we are seeking to use them as means or grounds of conduct, or\r\nto avail ourselves of them as conditions, in coping with the general\r\nsituation from which our attention has abstracted them.\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis of the conditions of the consciousness of objectivity\r\nwe must now proceed to inquire whether in the typical ethical and\r\neconomic situations, as they have been described, essentially these same\r\nconditions are present.\r\n\r\nIn the ethical situation, according to our statement, the subject of the\r\njudgment (the object of attention) is the new end which has just been\r\npresented in imagination, and we have now to see that the agent's\r\nattitude toward this end is for our present purpose essentially the same\r\nas toward a physical object which is under scrutiny. For just as the\r\nphysical object is such for consciousness because it is partly relevant\r\n(whether in the way of furthering or of hindering) to the agent's\r\npurpose, but as yet partly not understood from this point of view, so\r\nthe imaged end may likewise be ambiguous. The agent's moral purpose may\r\nbe the (very likely mythical) primitive one of which we read in\r\n\"associational\" discussions of the moral consciousness--that of avoiding\r\npunishment. It may be that of \"imitative,\" sympathetic obedience to\r\nauthority--a sentiment whose fundamental importance for ethical\r\npsychology has long remained without due recognition.[120] It may be\r\nloyalty to an ideal of conscience, or yet again a purpose of enlargement\r\nand development of personality. But on either supposition the\r\ncompatibility of the end with the prevailing standard or principle of\r\ndecision may be a matter of doubt and so call for judgment. The problem\r\nwill, of course, be a problem in the full logical sense as involving\r\njudgment of the type described in our discussion of the ethical\r\nsituation only when the attitudes of obedience to authority and to fixed\r\nideals have been outgrown; but, on the other hand, as might be shown, it\r\nis just the inevitable increasing use of judgment with reference to\r\nthese formulations of the moral life which gradually undermines them\r\nand, by a kind of \"internal dialectic\" of the moral consciousness,\r\nbrings the agent to recognition as well as to more perfect practice of a\r\nlogical or deliberative method.\r\n\r\nThe end, then, is, in the typical ethical situation, an _object_ which\r\none must determine by analysis and reconstruction as a means or\r\ncondition of moral \"integrity\" and progress. It is, accordingly, in the\r\nsecond place, an object upon whose determination a definite activity of\r\nthe agent is regarded by him as depending. Just as in the physical\r\njudgment-process the object is set off over against the self and\r\nregarded as a given thing which, when once completely defined, will\r\nprompt certain movements of the body, so here the contemplated act is an\r\nobject which, when fully defined in all its relevant psychological and\r\nsociological bearings, will prompt a definite act of rejection or\r\nacceptance by the self. Now, it might be shown, as we believe, that the\r\ncomplete psychological and sociological definition of the course of\r\nconduct _is_ in truth the full explanation of the choice; there is no\r\n_separate_ reaction of the moral self to which the course of conduct is,\r\nas defined, an external stimulus. So also in the sphere of physical\r\njudgment complete definition passes over into action--or the\r\nappreciative mode of consciousness which accompanies action--without\r\nbreach of continuity. But within the judgment-process in all its forms\r\nthere is in the agent's apprehension this characteristic feature of\r\napparent separation between the subject as an objective thing presently\r\nto be known and used or responded to, and the predicate as a response\r\nyet to be perfected in details, but at the right time, when one has\r\nproper warrant, to be set free. It is not our purpose here to speak of\r\nmetaphysical interpretations or misinterpretations of this functional\r\ndistinction; but only to argue from the presence of the distinction in\r\nthe ethical type of judgment as in the physical as genuine an\r\nobjectivity for the ethical type as can be ascribed to the other. The\r\nethical judgment is objective in the sense that in it an object--an\r\nimaged mode of conduct taken as such--is presented for development to a\r\ndegree of adequacy at which one can accept it or reject it as a mode of\r\nconduct. The ethical predicates Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, each pair\r\nrepresenting a particular standpoint, as we shall later see, signify\r\nthis accepting or rejecting movement of the self, this \"act of will,\" of\r\nwhich, as an act in due time to be performed, the agent is more or less\r\nacutely conscious in the course of moral judgment.\r\n\r\nIn the economic situation also, as above described, there is present the\r\nrequisite condition of the consciousness of objectivity. Here, as in the\r\nethical situation, an object is presented which one must redetermine,\r\nand toward which one must presently act in a way likewise to be\r\ndetermined in detail in judgment. We shall defer until a later stage\r\ndiscussion of the reason why this subject of the economic judgment is\r\nthe _means_ in the activity that is in progress. We are not yet ready to\r\nshow that the means _must_ be the center of attention under the\r\nconditions which have been specified. Here we need only note the fact of\r\ncommon experience that economic judgment does center upon the means, and\r\nshow that in this fact is given the objective status of the means in the\r\njudgment-process; for the economic problem is essentially that of\r\nwithdrawing a portion, a \"marginal increment,\" of the means from some\r\nuse or set of uses to which they are at present set apart, and applying\r\nit to the new end that has come to seem, on ethical grounds at least,\r\ndesirable; and we may regard this diversion as the essentially economic\r\nact which, in the agent's apprehension during judgment, is contingent\r\nupon the determination of the means. The object as economic is\r\naccordingly the means, or a marginal portion of the means, which is to\r\nbe thus diverted (or, so to speak, exposed to the likelihood of such\r\ndiversion), and its determination must be of such a nature as to show\r\nthe economic urgency, or at least the permissibility, of this diversion.\r\nInto this determination, manifestly, the results of much auxiliary\r\ninquiry into physical properties of the means must enter--such\r\nproperties, for example, as have to do with its technological fitness\r\nfor its present use as compared with possible substitutes, and its\r\nadaptability for the new use proposed. Taking the word in the broad\r\nsense of _object of thought_, it is always an object in space and time\r\nto which the economic judgment assigns an economic value; and it is true\r\nhere (just the same is true, _mutatis mutandis_, of the psychological\r\nand sociological determinations necessary to the fixation of ethical\r\nvalue) that the _economically motivated_ physical determination of the\r\nobjective means from the standpoint of the emergency in hand is the full\r\n\"causal\" explanation of the economic act. It must, however, be carefully\r\nobserved that this physical determination is in the typical case\r\naltogether incidental, from the agent's standpoint, to the assignment of\r\nan economic character or value to the means--a value which will at the\r\nclose of the judgment come to conscious recognition. As we shall see,\r\nthe process is directed throughout by reference to economic principles\r\nand standards, and what shall be an adequate determination in the case\r\ndepends upon the precision with which these are formulated and the\r\nstrenuousness with which they are applied. In a word, the economic\r\njudgment assigns to the physical object, as known at the outset, a new\r\nnon-physical character. Throughout the judgment-process this character\r\nis gaining in distinctness, and at the end it is accepted as the Value\r\nof the means, as warrant for the diversion of them to the new use which\r\nhas been decided on.[121]\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider whether in the actual ethical and economic\r\nexperience of men there is any direct evidence confirming the\r\nconclusions which our logical analysis of the respective situations\r\nwould appear to require. Can any phases of the total experience of\r\nworking out a satisfactory course of conduct in these typical\r\nemergencies be appealed to as actually showing at least some tacit\r\nrecognition that these types of judgment present each one an order of\r\nreality or an aspect of the one reality?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, one must recognize that in the agent's own\r\napprehension a judgment of value has something more than a purely\r\nsubjective meaning. It is never offered, by one who has taken the\r\ntrouble to work it out more or less laboriously and then to express it\r\nin terms which are certainly objective, as a mere announcement of _de\r\nfacto_ determination or a registration of arbitrary whim and caprice.\r\nOne no more means to announce a groundless choice or a choice based upon\r\npleasure felt in contemplation of the imaged end than in his judgments\r\nconcerning the physical universe he means to affirm coexistences and\r\nsequences, agreements and disagreements, of \"ideas\" as psychical\r\nhappenings. That there is an ethical or economic truth to which one can\r\nappeal in doubtful cases is, indeed, the tacit assumption in all\r\ncriticism of another's deliberate conduct; the contrary assumption, that\r\ncriticism is merely the opposition of one's own private prejudice or\r\ndesire to the equally private prejudice or desire of another, would\r\nrender all criticism and mutual discussion of ethical problems\r\nmeaningless and futile in the plain man's apprehension as in the\r\nphilosopher's. For the plain man has a spontaneous confidence in his\r\nknowledge of the material world which makes him look askance at any\r\nalleged analysis of his sense-perceptions and scientific judgments into\r\n\"associations of ideas,\" and the same confidence, or something very like\r\nit, attaches to judgments of these other types. It may perhaps be\r\neasier (though the concession is a very doubtful one) to destroy a naïve\r\nconfidence in the objectivity of moral truth than a like confidence in\r\nscientific knowledge, but it must be remembered that the plain man's\r\nsense of the urgency, at least of ethical problems, if not of economic,\r\nis commonly less acute than for the physical. In the plain man's\r\nexperience serious moral problems are infrequent--problems of the true\r\ntype, that is, which cannot be disposed of as mere cases of temptation;\r\none must have attained a considerable capacity for sympathy and a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of social relations before either the recognition\r\nof such problems or proper understanding of their significance is\r\npossible. Moral and economic crises are not vividly presented in\r\nsensuous imagery excepting in minds of developed intelligence,\r\nexperience, and imaginative power; and the judgments reached in coping\r\nwith them do not, as a rule, obviously call for nicely measured,\r\ncalculated, and adjusted bodily movements. The immediate act of\r\nexecuting an important economic judgment may be a very commonplace\r\nperformance, like the dictation of a letter, and an ethical decision\r\nmay, however great its importance for future overt conduct, be expressed\r\nby no immediate visible movements of the body. But this possible\r\ndifference of impressiveness between physical and other types of\r\njudgments is from our present standpoint unessential; and indeed, after\r\nall, it cannot be denied that there are persons whose sense of moral\r\nobligation is quite as distinct and influential, and even sensuously\r\nvivid, as their conviction of the real existence of an external world.\r\nTo the average man it certainly is clear that, as Dr. Martineau\r\ndeclares, \"it is an inversion of moral truth to say ... that honour is\r\nhigher than appetite _because_ we feel it so; we feel it so because it\r\n_is_ so. This '_is_' we know to be not contingent on our apprehension,\r\nnot to arise from our constitution of faculty, but to be a reality\r\nirrespective of us in adaptation to which our nature is constituted, and\r\nfor the recognition of which the faculty is given.\"[122] And the\r\nimpressiveness, to most minds, of likening the sublimity of the moral\r\nlaw to the visible splendor of the starry heavens would seem to suggest\r\nthat the apprehension of moral truth is a mode of consciousness, in form\r\nat least, so far akin to sense-perception as to be capable of\r\nillustration and even reinforcement from that type of experience.\r\n\r\nAt this point we must revert to a suggestion which presented itself\r\nabove in another connection, but which at the time could not be further\r\ndeveloped. This was, in a word, that there is often a feeling of\r\n_obtrusiveness_ in our appreciation of the objectivity of the things\r\nbefore us in ordinary sense-perception (or physical judgment) which is\r\nnot unlike the felt insistence of remorse and grief.[123] This feeling\r\nis so conspicuous a feature of the state of consciousness in physical\r\njudgment as frequently to serve the plain man as his last and\r\nirrefragable evidence of the metaphysical independence of the material\r\nworld, and it is indeed a feature whose explanation does throw much\r\nlight upon the meaning of the consciousness of objectivity as a factor\r\nwithin experience. Now, there is another common feeling--or, as we do\r\nnot scruple to call it, another emotion--which is perhaps quite as often\r\nappealed to in this way; though, as we believe, never in quite the same\r\nconnection in any argument in which the two experiences are called upon\r\nto do service to the same end. Material objects, we are told, are\r\n_reliable_ and _stable_ as distinguished from the fleeting illusive\r\nimages of a dream--they have a \"solidity\" in virtue of which one can\r\n\"depend upon them,\" are \"hard and fast\" remaining faithfully where one\r\ndeposits them for future use or, if they change and disappear, doing so\r\nin accordance with fixed laws which make the changes calculable in\r\nadvance. The material realm is the realm of \"solid fact\" in which one\r\ncan work with assurance that causes will infallibly produce their right\r\nand proper effects, and to which one willingly returns from the\r\ndream-world in which his adversary, the \"idealist,\" would hold him\r\nspellbound. We propose now briefly to consider these two modes of\r\napprehension of external physical reality in the light of the general\r\nanalysis of judgment given above--from which it will appear that they\r\nare, psychologically, emotional expressions of what have been set forth\r\nas the essential features of the judgment-situation, whether in its\r\nphysical, ethical, or economic forms. From this we shall argue that\r\nthere should actually be in the ethical and economic spheres similar, or\r\nessentially identical, \"emotions of reality,\" and we shall then proceed\r\nto verify the hypothesis by pointing to those ethical and economic\r\nexperiences which answer the description.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the center of attention or subject in the\r\njudgment-process is as such problematic--in the sense that there are\r\ncertain of its observed and recognized attributes which make it in some\r\nsense relevant and useful to the purpose in hand, while yet other of its\r\nattributes (or absences of certain attributes) suggest conflicting\r\nactivities. The object which one sees is certainly a stone and of\r\nconvenient size for hurling at the pursuing animal. The situation has\r\nbeen analyzed and found to demand a missile, and this demand has led to\r\nsearch for and recognition of a stone. The stone, however, may be of a\r\ncolor suggesting a soft and crumbling texture, or its form may appear\r\nfrom a distance to be such as to make it practically certain to miss the\r\nmark, however carefully it may be aimed and thrown. Until these points\r\nof difficulty have been ascertained, the stone is wanting still in\r\ncertain essential determinations. So far as it has been certainly\r\ndetermined, it prompts to the response directly suggested by one's\r\ngeneral end of defense and escape, but there are these other indications\r\nwhich hold this response in check and which, if verified, will cause the\r\nstone to be let lie unused. Now, we have, in this situation of conflict\r\nor tension between opposed incitements given by the various\r\ndiscriminated characters of the object, the explanation of the aspect of\r\nobtrusiveness, of arbitrary resistance to and independence of one's\r\nwill, which for the time being seems the unmistakable mark or\r\ncoefficient of the thing's objectivity. For it is not the object as a\r\nwhole that is obtrusive; indeed, clearly, there could be no\r\nobtrusiveness on the part of an \"object as a whole,\" and in such a case\r\nthere could also be no judgment. The obtrusion in the case before us is\r\nnot a sense of the energy of a recalcitrant metaphysical object put\r\nforth upon a coerced and helpless human will, but simply a conscious\r\ninterpretation of the inhibition of certain of the agent's motor\r\ntendencies by certain others prompted by the object's \"suspicious\" and\r\nas yet undetermined appearances or possible attributes. The object as\r\namenable to use--those of its qualities which taken by themselves are\r\nunquestionable and clearly conducive to the agent's purpose--needs no\r\nattention for the moment, let us say. The attention is rather upon the\r\ndubious and to all appearance unfavorable qualities, and these for the\r\ntime being make up the sum and content of the agent's knowledge of the\r\nobject. On the other hand, the agent as an active self is identified\r\nwith the end and with those modes of response to the object which\r\npromise to contribute directly to its realization. It is in this\r\ndirection that his interest is set and he strains with all his powers of\r\nmind to move, and it is upon the self as identified with, and for the\r\ntime being expressed in, the \"effort of the agent's will\" that the\r\nobject as resistant, refusing to be misconstrued, obtrudes. One _must_\r\nsee the object and _must_ acknowledge its apparent, or in the end its\r\nascertained, unfitness. One is \"coerced.\" The situation is one of\r\nconflict, and it is out of the conflict that the essentially emotional\r\nexperience of \"resistance\" emerges.[124] The more special emotions of\r\nimpatience, anger, or discouragement may in a given case not be present\r\nor may be suppressed, but the emotion of objectivity will still\r\nremain.[125]\r\n\r\nOn the same general principles the other of our two coefficients of\r\nreality may be explained. Let us assume that the stone in our\r\nillustration has at last been cleared of all ambiguity in its\r\nsuggestion, having been taken as a missile, and that the man in flight\r\nnow holds it ready awaiting the most favorable moment for hurling it at\r\nhis pursuer. It will hardly be maintained that under these conditions\r\nthe coefficient of the stone's reality as an object consists in its\r\nobtrusiveness, in its resistance to or coercion of the self. The stone\r\nis now regarded as a fixed and determinate feature of the situation--a\r\ncondition which can be counted on, whatever else may fail. Over against\r\nother still uncertain aspects of the situation (which are now in _their_\r\nturn real because resistant, coercive, and obtrusive) stands the stone\r\nas a reassuring fact upon and about which the agent can build up the\r\nwhole plan of conduct which may, if all goes well, bring him safely out\r\nof his predicament. The stone has, so to speak, passed over to the \"end\"\r\nside of the situation, and although it may have to be rejected for some\r\nother means of defense, as the definition of the situation proceeds and\r\nthe plan of action accordingly changes (as in some degree it probably\r\nmust), nevertheless for the time being the imaged activities as stimulus\r\nto which the stone is now accepted are a fixed part of the plan and\r\nguide in further judgment of the means still undefined. The agent can\r\nhardly recur to the stone, when, after attending for a time to the\r\nbewildering perplexities of the situation, he pauses once more to take\r\nan inventory of his certain resources, without something of an emotional\r\nthrill of assurance and encouragement. In this emotional appreciation of\r\nthe \"solidity\" and \"dependability\" of the object the second of our\r\ncoefficients of reality consists. This might be termed the Recognition,\r\nthe other the Perception, coefficient. Classifying them as emotions,\r\nbecause both are phenomena of tension in activity, we should group the\r\nPerception coefficient with emotions of the Contraction type, like grief\r\nand anger, and the Recognition coefficient with the Expansion emotions,\r\nlike joy and triumph.\r\n\r\nNow, in the foregoing interpretation no reference has been made to any\r\nconditions peculiar to the physical type of judgment-situation. The\r\nground of explanation has been the feature of arrest of activity for the\r\nsake of reconstruction, and this, if our analyses have been correct, is\r\nthe essence of the ethical and economic situations as well as of the\r\nphysical. Can there then be found in these two spheres experiences of\r\nthe same nature and emerging under the same general conditions as our\r\nPerception and Recognition coefficients of reality? If so, then our case\r\nfor the objective significance and value of ethical and economic\r\njudgment is in so far strengthened. (1) In the first place, then, the\r\nobject in its economic character is problematic, assuming a desire on\r\nthe agent's part to apply it, as means, to some new or freshly\r\ninteresting end, because it has already been, and accordingly now is,\r\nset apart for other uses and cannot thoughtlessly be withdrawn from\r\nthem. Extended illustration is not needed to remind one that these\r\nestablished and hitherto unquestioned uses will haunt the economic\r\nconscience as obtrusively and inhibit the desired course of economic\r\nconduct with as much energy of resistance as in the other case will any\r\nof the contrary promptings of a physical object. Moreover, the\r\nRecognition coefficient may as easily be identified in this connection.\r\nIf one's scruples gain the day, in such a case one has at least a sense\r\nof comforting assurance in the conservatism of his choice and its\r\naccordance with the facts, however unreconciled in another way one may\r\nbe to the deprivation that has thus seemed to be necessary. If, however,\r\nthe new end in a measure makes good its case and the modes of\r\nexpenditure which the \"scruples\" represented have been readjusted in\r\naccordance with it, then the means, no less than before the new\r\ninterpretation had been placed upon them, will enjoy the status of\r\nReality in the economic sense. They will be real now, however, not in\r\nthe obtrusive way, as presenting aspects which inhibit the leading\r\ntendency in the judgment-process, but, instead, as means having a fixed\r\nand certain character in one's economic life, which, after the\r\nhesitation and doubt just now superseded, one may safely count upon and\r\nwill do well to keep in view henceforth. (2) In the second place, mere\r\nmention of the corresponding ethical experiences must suffice, since\r\nonly extended illustration from literature and life would be fully\r\nadequate: on the one hand, the \"still small voice\" of Conscience or the\r\nauthoritativeness of Duty, \"stern daughter of the voice of God;\" and, on\r\nthe other, the restful assurance with which, from the vantage-ground of\r\na satisfying decision, one may look back in wonder at the possibility of\r\nso serious a temptation or in rejoicing over the new-won freedom from a\r\nburdensome and repressive prejudice.\r\n\r\nThis must for the present serve as positive exposition of our view as\r\nto the objective significance of the valuational types of judgment.\r\nThere are certain essential points which have as yet not been touched\r\nupon, and there are certain objections to the general view the\r\nconsideration of which will serve further to explain it; but the\r\ndiscussion of these various matters will more conveniently follow the\r\nspecial analysis of the valuational judgments, to which we shall now\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the last analysis the ultimate motive of all reflective thought is\r\nthe progressive determination of the ends of conduct. Physical judgment,\r\nor, in psychological terms, reflective attention to objects in the\r\nphysical world, is at every turn directed and controlled by reference to\r\na gradually developing purpose, so that the process may also be\r\ndescribed as one of bringing to fulness of definition an at first\r\nvaguely conceived purpose through ascertainment and determination of the\r\nmeans at hand. The problematic situation in which reflection takes its\r\nrise inevitably develops in this two-sided way into consciousness of a\r\ndefinite end on the one side, and of the means or conditions of\r\nattaining it on the other.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that there _may_ be involved in any finally\r\nsatisfactory determination of a situation an explicit reflection upon\r\nand definition of the controlling end which is present and gives point\r\nand direction to the physical determination. But very often such is not\r\nthe case. When a child sees a bright object at a distance and makes\r\ntoward it, availing himself more or less skilfully of such assistance as\r\nintervening articles of furniture may afford, there is of course no\r\nconsciousness on his part of any definite purpose as such, and this is\r\nto say that the child does not subject his conduct to criticism from the\r\nstandpoint of the value or its ends. There is simply strong desire for\r\nthe distant red ball, controlling all the child's movements for the\r\ntime being and prompting a more or less critical inspection of the\r\nintervening territory with reference to the easiest way of crossing it.\r\nThe purpose is implicitly accepted, not explicitly determined, as a\r\npreliminary to physical determination of the situation. If one may speak\r\nof a development of the purpose in such a case as this, one must say\r\nthat the development into details comes through judgment of the\r\nenvironing conditions. To change the illustration in order not to commit\r\nourselves to the ascription of too developed a faculty of judgment to\r\nthe child, this is true likewise of any process of reflective attention\r\nin the mind of an adult in which a general purpose is accepted at the\r\noutset and is carried through to execution without reflection upon its\r\nethical or economic character as a purpose. The specific purpose as\r\nexecuted is certainly not the same as the general purpose with which the\r\nreflective process took its rise. It is filled out with details, or may\r\nperhaps even be quite different in its general outlines. There has\r\nnecessarily been development and perhaps even transformation, but our\r\ncontention is that all this has been effected in and through a process\r\nof judgment in which the conditions of action, and not the purpose\r\nitself, have been the immediate objects of determination. Upon these the\r\nattention has been centered, though of course the attention was directed\r\nto them by the purpose. To state the case in logical terms, it has been\r\nonly through selection and determination of the means and conditions of\r\naction from the standpoint of predicates suggested by the general\r\npurpose accepted at the outset that this purpose itself had been\r\nrendered definite and practical and possible of execution. Probably such\r\ncases are seldom to be found in the adult experience. As a rule, the\r\ncourse of physical or technological judgment will almost always bring to\r\nlight implications involved in the accepted purpose which must\r\ninevitably raise ethical and economic questions; and the resolution of\r\nthese latter will in turn afford new points of view for further physical\r\ndetermination of the situation. In such processes the logical points of\r\nthe problem of ethical and economic valuation come clearly into view.\r\n\r\nIn our earlier account of the matter it was more convenient to use\r\nlanguage which implied that ethical and economic judgment must be\r\npreceded by implicit or explicit acceptance of a definite situation\r\npresented in sense-perception, and that these evaluating judgments could\r\nbe carried through to their goal only upon the basis of such an\r\ninventory of fixed conditions. Thus the ultimate ethical quality of the\r\ngeneral purpose of building a house would seem to depend upon the\r\nprecise form which this purpose comes to assume after the actual\r\npresence and the quality of the means of building have been ascertained\r\nand the economic bearings of the proposed expenditure have been\r\nconsidered. Surely it is a waste of effort to debate with oneself upon\r\nthe ethical rightness of a project which is physically impossible or\r\nelse out of the question from the economic point of view. We are,\r\nhowever, now in a position to see that this way of looking at the matter\r\nis both inaccurate and self-contradictory. In the actual development of\r\nour purposes there is no such orderly and inflexible arrangement of\r\nstages; and if it is a waste of effort to deliberate upon a purpose that\r\nis physically impossible, it may, with still greater force, be argued\r\nthat we cannot find, and judge the fitness of, the necessary physical\r\nmeans until we know what, precisely, it is that we wish to do. The truth\r\nis that there is constant interplay and interaction between the various\r\nphases of the inclusive judgment-process, or rather, more than this,\r\nthat there is a complete and thoroughgoing mutual implication. It is\r\nindeed true that our ethical purposes cannot take form in a vacuum apart\r\nfrom consideration of their physical and economic possibility, but it\r\nis also true that our physical and economic problems are ultimately\r\nmeaningless and impossible, whether of statement or of solution, except\r\nas they are interpreted as arising in the course of ethical conflict.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, to do, in the present division, with situations in which,\r\nwhether at the outset or from time to time during the course of the\r\nreflective process, there is explicit conflict between ends of conduct.\r\nThese situations are the special province of the judgment of valuation.\r\nOur line of argument may be briefly indicated in advance as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The judgment of valuation, whether expressed in terms of the\r\nindividual experience or in terms of social evolution, is essentially\r\nthe process of the explicit and deliberate resolution of conflict\r\nbetween ends. As an incidental, though nearly always indispensable, step\r\nto the final resolution of such conflict, physical judgment, or, in\r\ngeneral, the judgment of fact or existence, plays its part, this part\r\nbeing to define the situation in terms of the means necessary for the\r\nexecution of the end that is gradually taking form. The two modes of\r\njudgment mutually incite and control each other, and neither could\r\ncontinue to any useful purpose without this incitement and control of\r\nthe other. Both modes of judgment are objective in content and\r\nsignificance. At the end of the reflective process and immediately upon\r\nthe verge of execution of the end or purpose which has taken form the\r\nresult may be stated or apprehended in either of two ways: (1) directly,\r\nin terms of the end, and (2) indirectly, in terms of the ordered system\r\nof existent means which have been discovered, determined, and arranged.\r\nIf such final survey of the result be taken by way of preparation for\r\naction, or for whatever reason, the end will be apprehended as\r\npossessing ethical value and the means, under conditions later to be\r\nspecified, as possessing economic value.\r\n\r\n2. What then is the nature and source of this apprehension of end or\r\nmeans as valuable? The consciousness of end or means as valuable is an\r\nemotional consciousness expressive of the agent's practical attitude as\r\ndetermined in the just completed judgment of ethical or economic\r\nvaluation and arising in consequence of the inhibition placed upon the\r\nactivities which constitute the attitude by the effort of apprehending\r\nor imaging the valued object. Ethical and economic value are thus\r\nstrictly correlative; psychologically they are emotional incidents of\r\napprehending in the two respective ways just indicated the same total\r\nresult of the inclusive complex judgment-process. Finally, as the moment\r\nof action comes on, the consciousness of the ethically valued end lapses\r\nfirst; then the consciousness of economic value is lost in a purely\r\n\"physical,\" _i. e._, technological, consciousness of the means and their\r\nproperties and interrelations in the ordered system which has been\r\narranged; and this finally merges into the immediate and\r\nundifferentiated consciousness of activity as use of the means becomes\r\nsure and unhesitating.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that the ends which oppose each other in an ethical\r\nsituation (that is, a situation for the time being seen in an ethical\r\naspect) are related, and the ends in an economic situation are not, we\r\nby no means wish to imply that in the one case we have in this fact of\r\nrelatedness a satisfactory solution at hand which is wanting in the\r\nother. To feel, for example, that there is a direct and inherent\r\nrelationship between a cherished purpose of self-culture and an ideal of\r\nsocial service which seems now to require the abandonment of the purpose\r\ndoes not mean that one yet knows just _how_ the two ends should be\r\nrelated in his life henceforth; and again, to say that one can see no\r\ninherent relation between a desire for books and pictures and the need\r\nof food, excepting in so far as both ends depend for their realization\r\nupon a limited supply of means, is not to say that the issue of the\r\nconflict is not of ethical significance. Such a view as we here reject\r\nwould amount to a denial of the possibility of genuinely problematic\r\nethical situations[126] and would accord with the opinion that economic\r\njudgment as such lies apart from the sphere of ethics and is at most\r\nsubject only to occasional revision and control in the light of ethical\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nBy the relatedness of the ends in a situation we mean the fact, more or\r\nless explicitly recognized by the agent, that the new, and as yet\r\nundefined, purpose which has arisen belongs in the same system with the\r\nend, or group of ends, which the standard inhibiting immediate action\r\nrepresents. The standard inhibits action in obedience to the impulse\r\nthat has come to consciousness, and the image of the new end is, on its\r\npart, definite and impressive enough to inhibit action in obedience to\r\nthe standard. The relatedness of the two factors is shown in a practical\r\nway by the fact that, in the first instance at least, they are tacitly\r\nexpected to work out their own adjustment. By the process already\r\ndescribed in outline, subject and predicate begin to develop and thereby\r\nto approach each other, and a provisional or partial solution of the\r\nproblem may thus be reached without resort to any other method than that\r\nof direct comparison and adjustment of the ends involved on either side.\r\nThe standard which has been called in question has enough of congruence\r\nwith the new imaged purpose to admit of at least some progress toward a\r\nsolution through this method.\r\n\r\nWe can best come to an understanding of this recognition of the\r\nrelatedness of the ends in ethical valuation by pausing to examine\r\nsomewhat carefully into the conditions involved in the acceptance or\r\nreflective acknowledgment of a defined end of conduct as being one's\r\nown. Any new end in coming to consciousness encounters some more or\r\nless firmly established habit represented in consciousness by a sign or\r\nsymbolic image of some sort, the habit being itself the outcome of past\r\njudgment-process. Our present problem is the significance of the agent's\r\nrecognition of a relatedness between his new impulsive end and the end\r\nwhich represents the habit, and we shall best approach its solution by\r\nconsidering the various factors and conditions involved in the agent's\r\nconscious recognition of the established end as being such.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any determinate end there is inevitably implied a number of groups of\r\nfactual judgments in which are presented the objective conditions under\r\nwhich execution of the end or purpose must take place. There is in the\r\nfirst place a general view of environing conditions, physical and\r\nsocial, presented in a group of judgments (1) descriptive of the means\r\nat hand, of the topography of the region in which the purpose is to be\r\ncarried out, of climatic conditions, and the like, and (2) descriptive\r\nof the habits of thought and feeling of the people with whom one is to\r\ndeal, their prejudices, their tastes, and their institutions. The\r\nproject decided on may, let us say, be an individual or a national\r\nenterprise, whether philanthropic or commercial, which is to be launched\r\nin a distant country peopled by partly civilized races. In addition to\r\nthese groups of judgments upon the physical and sociological conditions\r\nunder which the work must proceed, there will also be a more or less\r\nadequate and impartial knowledge of one's own physical and mental\r\nfitness for the enterprise, since the work as projected may promise to\r\ntax one's physical powers severely and to require, for its successful\r\nconduct, large measure of industry, devotion, patience, and wisdom.\r\nIndeed any determinate purpose whatever inevitably implies a more or\r\nless varied and comprehensive inventory of conditions. Further\r\nillustration is not necessary for our present purpose. We may say that\r\nin a general way the conditions relevant to a practical purpose will\r\ngroup themselves naturally under four heads of classification, as\r\nphysical, sociological, physiological, and psychological. All four\r\nclasses are objective, though the last two embrace conditions peculiar\r\nto the agent as an individual over against the environment to which for\r\npurposes of his present activity he stands in a sense opposed.\r\n\r\nNow our present interest is not so much in the enumeration and\r\nclassification of possible relevant conditions in a typical situation as\r\nin the significance of these relevant conditions in the agent's\r\napprehension of them. Perhaps this significance cannot better be\r\ndescribed than by saying that essentially and impressively the\r\nconditions are apprehended as, taken together, _warranting_ the purpose\r\nthat has been determined. We appeal, in support of this account of the\r\nmatter, to an impartial introspection of the way in which the means and\r\nconditions of action stand related to the formed purpose in the moment\r\nof survey of a situation. The various details presented in the survey of\r\na situation are apprehended, not as bare facts such as one might find\r\nset down in a scientist's notebook, but as warranting--as closely,\r\nuniquely, and vitally relevant to--the action that is about to be taken.\r\nThis, as we believe, is a fair account of the situation in even the\r\ncommoner and simpler emergencies that confront the ordinary man. Quite\r\nconspicuously is it true of cases in which the purpose is a purely\r\ntechnological one that has been worked out with considerable difficulty\r\nand is therefore not executed until after a somewhat careful survey of\r\nconditions has been taken. It is often true likewise in cases of express\r\nethical judgment; if the ethical phases of the reflective process have\r\nnot been excessively long and difficult, our definite sense of the\r\nethical value of the act we are about to do lapses quite easily, and the\r\nfactual aspects and features of the situation as given in one or more of\r\nthe four classes which we have distinguished take on an access of\r\nsignificance in their character of warranting, confirming, or even\r\ncompelling the act determined upon. Of our ordinary sense-perception in\r\nthe moments of its actual functioning no less than of conscience in its\r\naspect of a moral perceptive faculty are the words of Bishop Butler\r\nsensibly true that \"to preside and govern, from the very economy and\r\nconstitution of man, belongs to it.\"[127] I Even in cases of more\r\nserious moral difficulty this sanctioning aspect of the means and\r\nconditions of action is not overshadowed. If the situation is one in\r\nwhich by reason of their complexity these play a conspicuous rôle and\r\nmust be surveyed, by way of preparation on the agents' part, for\r\nperformance of the act, they inevitably assume, for the agent, their\r\nproper functional character. In general, the conditions presented in the\r\nsystem of factual judgments have a certain \"rightful authority\" which\r\nthey seem to lend to the purpose or end with reference to which they\r\nwere worked out to their present degree of factual detail. The\r\nconditions can thus seem to sanction the end because conditions and end\r\nhave been worked out together. Gradual development on the one side\r\nprompts analytical inquiry upon the other and is in turn directed and\r\nadvanced by the results of this inquiry. In the end the result may be\r\nread off either in terms of end or in terms of conditions and\r\nmeans.[128] The two readings must be in accord and the agent's\r\napprehension of the conditions as warrant for the end is expression in\r\nconsciousness of this \"agreement.\"[129]\r\n\r\nNow in this mode of apprehension of factual conditions there is a highly\r\nimportant logical implication--an implication which inevitably comes\r\nmore and more clearly into view with the continued exercise of judgment,\r\neven though the agent's habit of interest in the scrutiny of perplexing\r\nsituations may still remain, by reason of the want of trained capacity\r\nfor a broader view, limited in its range quite strictly to the physical\r\nsphere. This implication is, we shall declare at once, that of an\r\nendeavoring, striving, active principle or self which can be helped or\r\nhindered in its unfolding by particular purposes and sets of\r\ncorresponding conditions--can lose or gain, through devotion to\r\nparticular purposes, in the breadth, fulness, and energy of its life.\r\nThe agent's apprehension of and reference to this active principle of\r\ncourse varies in all degrees of explicitness, according to\r\ncircumstances, from the vague awareness that is present in a simple case\r\nof physical judgment to the clear recognition and endeavor at definition\r\nthat are characteristic of serious ethical crises.\r\n\r\nThat the situation should develop and bring to light this factor is what\r\nshould be expected on general grounds of logic--for to say that a set of\r\nconditions warrants or sanctions or confirms a given purpose implies\r\nthat our purposes can stand in need of warrant, and this would seem to\r\nbe impossible apart from reference to a process whose maintenance and\r\ndevelopment in and through our purposes are assumed as being as a matter\r\nof course desirable. It is of the essence of our contention that the\r\napprehension of the conditions of action as _warranting the end_ is a\r\nprimordial and necessary feature of the situation--indeed, its\r\nconstitutive feature. If our concern were with the psychological\r\ndevelopment of self-consciousness as a phase of reflective experience,\r\nwe should endeavor to show that this development is mediated in the\r\nfirst instance by the \"subjective\" phenomena of feeling, emotion, and\r\ndesire which find their place _in the course_ of the judgment-process.\r\nWe should then hold that, with the _conclusion_ of the judgment-process\r\nand the accompanying sense of the known conditions as reassuring and\r\nconfirmatory of the end, comes the earliest possibility of a\r\ndiscriminative recognition of the self as having been all along a\r\nnecessary factor in the process. We should hold that outside of the\r\n_process_ of reflective attention there can be no psychical or\r\n\"elementary\" _beginnings_ of self-consciousness, and then that, except\r\nas a development out of the experience to which we have referred as\r\nmarking the _conclusion_ of the attentive process, there can be no\r\nrecognized specific and in any degree definable consciousness of self.\r\nAll this, however, lies rather beside our present purpose. We wish\r\nsimply to insist that it is out of the apprehension of conditions as\r\nreassuring and confirmatory, out of this \"primordial germ,\" that the\r\nagent's definite recognition of himself as a center of development and\r\nexpenditure of energy takes its rise. Here are the beginnings of the\r\npossibility of self-conscious ethical and economic valuation.\r\n\r\nThis apprehension of the means as _warranting_ is, we have held, a fact\r\neven when the means surveyed are wholly of the physical sort, and we\r\nhave thereby implied that consciousness of the self as \"energetic\" may\r\ntake its rise in situations of this type or during the physical stage in\r\nthe development of a more complex total situation. It would be an\r\ninteresting speculation to consider to what extent and in what way the\r\ndevelopment of the sciences of sociology and physiology may have been\r\nessentially facilitated by the emergence of this form of\r\nself-consciousness. But however the case may stand with these sciences\r\nor with the rise of real interest in them in the mind of a given\r\nindividual, interest in the objective psychological conditions of a\r\ncontemplated act is certainly very closely dependent upon interest in\r\nthat subjective self which one has learned to know through the past\r\nexercise of judgment in definition and contemplation of conditions of\r\nthe three other kinds. The more diversified and complex the array of\r\nphysical and social conditions with reference to which one is to act,\r\nthe more important becomes not simply a clearly articulated knowledge of\r\nthese, but also a knowledge of oneself. The self that is warranted in\r\nits purpose by the surveyed conditions must hold itself in a steady and\r\nconsistent attitude during the performance on pain of \"falling short of\r\nits opportunity\" and thereby rendering nugatory the reflective process\r\nin which the purpose was worked out. Experience abundantly shows how\r\neasily the assurance that comes with the survey of conditions may come\r\nto grief, though there may have been on the side of the conditions, so\r\nfar as defined, no visible change; and in so far as self-consciousness\r\nhas already emerged as a distinguishable factor in such situations,\r\nfailures of the sort we here refer to are the more easily identified and\r\ninterpreted. Some sudden impulse may have broken in upon the execution\r\nof the chosen purpose; there may have been an unexpected shift of\r\ninterest away from that general phase of life which the purpose\r\nrepresented; or in any one of a number of other ways may have come about\r\na wavering and a slackening in the resolution which marked the\r\ncommencement of action. The \"energetic\" self forthwith (if we may so\r\nexpress it) recognizes that the sanction which the conditions so far as\r\nthen known gave to its purpose was a misleading because an incomplete\r\none, and it proceeds to develop within itself a new range of objective\r\nfact in which may be worked out the explanation, and thereby a method of\r\ncontrol, of these new disturbing phenomena. The qualities of patience\r\nunder disappointment, courage in encountering resistance, steadiness and\r\nself-control in sustained and difficult effort--these qualities and\r\nothers of like nature come to be discriminated from each other by\r\nintrospective analysis and may be as accurately measured, and in general\r\nas objectively studied, as any of the conditions to a saving knowledge\r\nand respect of which one may already have attained, and these newly\r\ndetermined psychological conditions will henceforth play the same part\r\nin affording sanction to one's purposes as do the rest. An ordered\r\nsystem of psychological categories or points of view comes to be\r\ndeveloped, and an accurate statement of conditions of personal\r\ndisposition and capacity relevant to each emergency as it arises will\r\nhereafter be worked out--over against and in tension with one's\r\ngradually forming purposes in like manner as are statements of all the\r\nother relevant objective aspects of the situation.[130]\r\n\r\nIn the \"energetic\" self, we shall now seek to show, we have the common\r\nand essential principle of both ethical and economic valuation which\r\nmarks these off from other and subordinate types of judgment. Let us\r\ndetermine as definitely as possible the nature and function of this\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the chosen purpose as one favorable or otherwise to\r\nthe self, and so the recognition of the self as capable of furtherance\r\nor retardation by its chosen purposes, is not always a feature of the\r\nstate of mind which may ensue upon completed judgment. In the commoner\r\nsituations of the everyday life of normal persons, as practically always\r\nin the lives of persons of relatively undeveloped reflective powers, it\r\nis quite wanting as a separate distinguished phase of the experience. In\r\nsuch cases it is present, if present at all, merely as the vaguely felt\r\nimplicit meaning of the recognition that the known conditions sanction\r\nand confirm the purpose. Such situations yield easily to attack and\r\nthreaten none of those dangers, none of those possible occasions for\r\nregret or remorse, of which complex situations make the person of\r\ndeveloped reflective capacity and long experience so keenly\r\napprehensive. They are disposed of with comparatively little of\r\nconscious reconstruction on either the subject or the predicate side,\r\nand when a conclusion has been reached the agent's recognition of the\r\nconditions carries with it the comfortable though too often delusive\r\nassurance of the complete and perfect eligibility of the purpose. If the\r\nquestion of eligibility is raised at all, the answer is given on the\r\ntacit principle that \"whatever purpose is, is right.\" To the \"plain\r\nman,\" and to all of us on certain sides of our lives, every purpose for\r\nwhich the requisite means and factual conditions are found to be at hand\r\nis, just as our purpose, therefore right.\r\n\r\nThe same experience of failure and disappointment which proves our\r\npurpose to have been, from the standpoint of enlargement and enrichment\r\nof the self, a mistaken one brings a clearer consciousness of the logic\r\nimplicit in our first confident belief in the purpose, and at the same\r\ntime emphasizes the need of making this logic explicit. The purpose, as\r\nwarranted to us by the conditions and assembled means that lay before\r\nus, was our own, and _as our own_ was implicitly a purpose of\r\nfurtherance of the self. The disappointment that has come brings this\r\nimplication more clearly into view, and likewise the need of methodical\r\nprocedure, not as before in the determination of _conditions_, but in\r\nthe determination of purposes as such; for the essence of the situation\r\nis that the _execution_ of the purpose has brought to light some\r\nunforeseen consequence now recognized as having been all the while in\r\nthe nature of things involved in the purpose. This consequence or group\r\nof consequences consists (in general terms) in the abatement or arrest\r\nof desirable modes of activity which find their motivation elsewhere in\r\nthe agent's system of accepted ends, and it is registered in\r\nconsciousness in that sense of restriction or repression from without\r\nwhich is a notable phase of all emotional experience, particularly in\r\nits early stages. The consequences are as undesirable as they are\r\nunexpected, and the reaction against them, at first emotional, presently\r\npasses over into the form of a reflective interpretation of the\r\nsituation to the effect that the self has suffered a loss by reason of\r\nits thoughtless haste in identifying itself with so unsafe a\r\npurpose.[131]\r\n\r\nIt is the essential logical function of the consciousness of self to\r\nstimulate the valuation processes which take their rise in the stage of\r\nreflective thought thus attained. The consciousness of self is a\r\npeculiarly baffling theme for discussion from whatever point of view,\r\nbecause one finds its meaning shifting constantly between the two\r\nextremes of a subjectivity to which \"all objects of all thought\" are\r\nexternal and an objective thing or system of energies which is known\r\njust as other things are--known in a sense by itself, to be sure, but\r\n_known_ nevertheless, and thought of as an object standing in possible\r\nrelations to other objects. Now, it is of the subjective self that we\r\nare speaking when we say that its essential function is the stimulation\r\nor incitement of the valuation processes, but manifestly in order to\r\nserve thus it must nevertheless be presented in some sort of sensuous\r\nimagery. The subjective self may, in fact, be thought of in many\r\nways--presented in many different sorts of imagery--but in all its forms\r\nit must be distinguished carefully from that objective self which, as\r\ndescribed in psychology, is the assemblage of conditions under which the\r\nsubjective or \"energetic\" self works out its purposes. It may be the\r\npale, attenuated double of the body, or a personal being standing in\r\nneed of deliverance from sin, or an atom of soul-substance, or, in our\r\npresent terminology, a center of developing and unfolding energy. The\r\nsignificant fact is that, however different in content and in motive\r\nthese various presentations of the subjective self may be, they are, one\r\nand all, as presentations and as in so far objective, stimuli to some\r\ndefinite response. The savage warrior deposits his double in a tree or\r\nstone for safety while he goes into battle; the self that is to be saved\r\nfrom sin is a self that prompts certain acceptable acts in satisfaction\r\nof the quasi-legal obligations that the fact of sin has laid upon the\r\nagent. The presented self, whatever the form it may assume as\r\npresentation, has its function, and this function is in general that of\r\nstimulus to the conservation and increase, in some sense, of the self\r\nthat is not presented, but for whom the presentation is. Now our own\r\npresent description of the self as \"energetic,\" as a center or source of\r\ndeveloping and unfolding energy is in its way a presentation. It\r\nconsists of sensuous imagery and suggests a mechanical process, or the\r\ngrowth of a plant perhaps, which if properly safeguarded will go on\r\nsatisfactorily--a process which one must not allow to be perturbed or\r\nhindered by external resistance or internal friction or to run down. To\r\nmany persons doubtless such an account would seem arbitrary and\r\nfantastic in the extreme, but no great importance need be attached to\r\nits details. The kind and number and sensuous vividness of the details\r\nin which this essential content of presentation may be clothed must of\r\ncourse depend, for each person, upon his psychical idiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as the habit of reflection upon purposes comes to be more\r\nfirmly fixed, and the procedure of valuation to be consciously\r\nmethodical and orderly, the sensuous content of the presented self must\r\ngrow constantly more and more attenuated until it has declined into a\r\nmere unexpressed principle or maxim or tacit presumption, prescribing\r\nthe free and impartial application of the method of valuation to\r\nparticular practical emergencies as these arise. For a self, consisting\r\nof presented content of whatever sort, which one seeks to further\r\nthrough attentive deliberation upon concrete purposes, must, just in so\r\nfar as it has _content_, determine the outcome of ethical judgment in\r\ndefinite ways. Thus the soul that must be saved from sin (if this be the\r\ncontent of the presented self) is one that has transgressed the law in\r\ncertain ways and the right relations that should subsist between\r\ncreature and Creator, and has thereby incurred a more or less\r\ntechnically definable guilt. This guilt can only be removed and the self\r\nrehabilitated in its normal relations to the law by an appropriate\r\nresponse to the situation--by a choice on the agent's part, first, of a\r\ncertain technical procedure of repentance, and then of a settled purpose\r\nof living as the law prescribes.[132] So also our own image of the self\r\nas \"energetic\" after the manner of a growing organism may well seem, if\r\ntaken too seriously as to its presentational details, to foster a bias\r\nin favor of over-conservative adherence to the established and the\r\naccredited as such.[133]\r\n\r\nThe argument of the last few paragraphs may be restated in the\r\nfollowing way in terms of the evolution of the individual's moral\r\nattitude or technique of self-control:\r\n\r\n1. In the stage of moral evolution in which custom and authority are the\r\ncontrolling principles of conduct, moral judgment in the proper sense of\r\nself-conscious, critical, and reconstructive valuation of purposes is\r\nwanting. Such judgment as finds here a place is at best of the merely\r\ncasuistical type, looking to a determination of particular cases as\r\nfalling within the scope of fixed and definite concepts. There is no\r\nself-consciousness except such as may be mediated by the sentiment of\r\nwilling obedience. It is, at this stage, not the _particular sort_ of\r\nconduct which the law prescribes that in the agent's apprehension\r\nenlarges and develops the self; so far as any thought of enlargement and\r\ndevelopment of the self plays a part in influencing conduct, these\r\neffects are such as, in the agent's trusting faith, will come from an\r\nentire and willing acceptance of the law as such. \"If any man will do\r\nHis will, he shall know of the doctrine.\" Moreover, the stage of custom\r\nand authority goes along with, in social evolution, either very simple\r\nsocial conditions or else conditions which, though very complex, are\r\nstable, so that in either case the conditions of conduct are in general\r\nin harmony with the conduct which custom and authority prescribe. The\r\nlaw, therefore, can be absolute and takes no account of possible\r\ninability to obey. The divine justice punishes infraction of the law\r\nsimply as objective infraction; not as sin, in proportion to the\r\nsinner's responsibility.\r\n\r\n2. But inevitably custom and authority come to be inadequate. As social\r\nconditions change, custom becomes antiquated and authority blunders,\r\nwavers, contradicts itself in the endeavor to prescribe suitable modes\r\nof individual conduct. Obedience no longer is the way to light. The self\r\nbecomes self-conscious through feeling more and more the repression and\r\nthe misdirection of its energies that obedience now involves. This is\r\nthe stage of subjective morality or conscience; and the rise of\r\nconscience, the attitude of appeal to conscience, means the beginning of\r\nendeavor at _methodical solution_ of those new problematic situations in\r\nthe attempt to deal with which authority as such has palpably collapsed.\r\nWe say, however, that conscience is the _beginning_ of this endeavor;\r\nfor conscience is, in fact, an ambiguous and essentially transitional\r\nphenomenon. On the one hand conscience is the inner nature of a man\r\nspeaking within him, and so the self furthers its own growth in\r\nlistening to this expression of itself. In this aspect conscience is\r\nmethodological. But on the other hand conscience _speaks_, and,\r\nspeaking, must say something determinate, however general this something\r\nmay be. In this aspect conscience is a _résumé_ of the _generic_ values\r\nrealized under the system of custom and authority, but to the present\r\ncontinued attainment of which the _particular prescriptions_ of custom\r\nand authority are no longer adequate guides. Conscience is thus at once\r\nan inward prompting to the application of logical method to the case in\r\nhand and a body of general or specific rules under some one of which the\r\ncase can be subsumed. In ethical theory we accordingly find no unanimity\r\nas to the nature of conscience. At the one extreme it is the voice of\r\nGod speaking in us or through us, in detailed and specific terms--and\r\nso, virtually, custom and authority in disguise. At the other it is an\r\nempty abstract intuition that the right is binding upon us--and, so,\r\nsimply the hypostasis of demand for a logical procedure. The history of\r\nethics presents us with all possible intermediate conceptions in which\r\nthese extreme motives are more or less skilfully interwoven or combined\r\nin varying proportions. The truth is that conscience is essentially a\r\ntransitional conception, and so necessarily looks before and after. In\r\none of its aspects it is a self which has come to miss (and therefore to\r\nimage for itself) the values and, it may be, a certain dawning sense of\r\nvitality and growth which obedience to authority once afforded.[134] In\r\nits other aspect it is a self that is looking forward in a self-reliant\r\nway to the determination on its own account of its purposes and values.\r\nAnd finally, as for the environing world of means and conditions,\r\nclearly this is not necessarily harmonious with and amenable to\r\nconscience; indeed, in the nature of things it can be only partially so.\r\nThe morality of conscience is, therefore, either mystical, a morality\r\nthat seeks to escape the world in the very moment of its affirmation\r\nthat the world is unreal (because worthless), or else it takes refuge in\r\na virtual distinction between \"absolute\" and \"relative\" morality (to\r\nborrow a terminology from a system in which properly it should have no\r\nplace), perhaps setting up as an intermediary between heaven and earth a\r\nmachinery of special dispensation.[135]\r\n\r\n3. Conscience professes in general, that is, to be autonomous, and the\r\nprofession is, strictly speaking, a contradiction in terms. Moreover,\r\napart from considerations of the logic of the situation, theories of\r\nconscience have, as a matter of fact, always lent themselves kindly to\r\ntheological purposes just as the theory of self-realization in its\r\nclassic modern statement rests upon a metaphysical doctrine of the\r\nAbsolute.[136] Inevitably the movement concealed within this essentially\r\nunstable conception must have its legitimate outcome (1) in a clearing\r\nof the presented self of its fixed elements of content, thus setting it\r\nfree in its character of a non-presentational principle of valuation,\r\nand (2) a setting apart of these elements of content from the principle\r\nof valuation as standards for reference and consultation rather than as\r\nlaw to be obeyed.\r\n\r\nWe have thus correlated our account of the logic whereby the \"energetic\"\r\nself comes to explicit recognition as stimulus to the valuation-process\r\nwith the three main stages in the moral evolution of the individual and\r\nthe race. We were brought to this first-mentioned part of our discussion\r\nby our endeavor to find out the factors involved in the first acceptance\r\nof a conscious purpose (or, indifferently, the subsequent recognition of\r\nit as a standard)--an endeavor prompted by the need of distinguishing,\r\nwith a view to their special analysis, the two types of\r\nvaluation-process. We now return to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following illustration will serve our present undertaking: A lawyer\r\nor man of business is struck by the great need of honest men in public\r\noffice, or has had his attention in some impressive way called to the\r\nfact of great inequality in the present distribution of wealth, and to\r\nthe diverse evils resulting therefrom. These facts hold his attention,\r\nperhaps against his will, and at last suggest the thought of his making\r\nsome personal endeavor toward improvement of conditions, political or\r\nsocial, as the case may be. On the other hand, however, the man has\r\nbefore him the promise of a successful or even brilliant career in his\r\nchosen occupation, and is already in the enjoyment of a substantial\r\nincome, which is rapidly increasing. Moreover, he has a family growing\r\nup about him, and he is not simply strongly interested in the early\r\ntraining and development of his children, and desirous of having himself\r\nsome share in conducting it, but he sees that the suitable higher\r\neducation of his children will in a few years make heavy demands upon\r\nhis pecuniary means. Here, then, we have a situation the analysis of\r\nwhich will enable us to distinguish and define the provinces of ethical\r\nand economic judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that we have here a conflict between ends. On the one\r\nside is the thought of public service in some important office or, let\r\nus say, the thought of bettering society in a more fundamental way by\r\njoining the propaganda of some proposed social reform. This end rests\r\nupon certain social impulses in the man's nature and appeals to him as\r\nstrongly, we may fairly assume, as would any purpose of immediate\r\nself-interest or self-indulgence, so that it stands before him and urges\r\nhim with an insistent pertinacity that at first even puts him on his\r\nguard against it as a temptation. Over against this concrete end or\r\nsubject of moral valuation stand other ends comprehended or symbolized\r\nin the ideals of regular and steady industry, of material provision for\r\nfamily, of paternal duty toward children, of scholarly achievement as\r\nlawyer or judge, and the like--ideals which are indeed practical and\r\npersonal, but which, as they now function, are general or universal in\r\ncharacter, are lacking in the concreteness and emotional quality which\r\nbelong to the new purpose which has just come to imagination and has\r\nbrought these ideals into action on the predicate side. Will this life\r\nof social agitation really be quite \"respectable,\" and befitting the\r\ncharacter of a sober and industrious man? Will it enable me to support\r\nand educate my family? Will it permit me to devote sufficient attention\r\nto their present care and training? And will it not so warp my nature,\r\nso narrow and concentrate my interests, as in a measure to disqualify me\r\nfor the right exercise of paternal authority over them in years to come?\r\nMoreover, will not a life of agitation, of constant intercourse with\r\nminds and natures in many ways inferior to my own and those of my\r\npresent professional associates, lower my intellectual and moral\r\nstandards, and so make of me in the end a less useful member of society\r\nthan I am at present? These and other questions like them present the\r\nissue in its earlier aspect. Presently, however, the tentative purpose\r\nputs in its defense, appealing to yet other recognized ideals or\r\nstandards of self-sacrifice, benevolence, or social justice as witnesses\r\nin its favor. The conflict thus takes on the subject-predicate form, as\r\nhas already been explained. On the one hand we have the undefined but\r\nstrongly insistent concrete purpose; on the other hand we have a number\r\nof symbolic concepts or universals standing for accepted and accredited\r\nhabitual modes of conduct. The problem is that of working the two sides\r\nof the situation together into a unified and harmonious plan of conduct\r\nwhich shall be at once concrete and particular, as a plan chosen by way\r\nof solution of a given present emergency, and universal, as having due\r\nregard for past modes of conduct, and as itself worthy of consideration\r\nin coping with future emergencies.\r\n\r\nNow, how shall we discriminate the ethical and the economic aspects of\r\nthe situation which we have described? We shall most satisfactorily do\r\nthis through a consideration of the various sorts of conditions and\r\nmeans of which account must be taken in working the situation through to\r\na solution, or (to express it more accurately) the various sorts of\r\nconditions and means which need to be defined over against the purpose\r\nas the purpose gradually develops into detailed form.\r\n\r\nWe may say, first of all, that there are _psychological_ conditions\r\nwhich must be taken into consideration in the case before us. Our thesis\r\nis that in so far as a situation gives rise to the determination of\r\npsychological conditions and is advanced along the way toward final\r\nsolution through determination of these, the situation is an ethical\r\none. In other words, we hold that the ends at issue in the situation are\r\n\"related\" in so far as they depend upon the same set of psychological\r\nconditions. In so far as these statements are not true of the situation\r\nthere must be a resort to economic judgment.\r\n\r\nBy the general questions suggested above as presenting themselves to\r\nthe agent we have indicated in what way the course of action taken must\r\nhave regard to certain psychological considerations. Entering upon the\r\nnew way of life will inevitably lessen the agent's interest in his\r\npresent professional pursuits and so make difficult, and in the end even\r\nirksome, any attempt at continuing in them either as a partial means of\r\nlivelihood or as a recreation. The new work will be absorbing--as indeed\r\nit must be if it is to be worth while. In the same way the man must\r\nrecognize that his nature is not one of the rare ones so richly endowed\r\nin capacity for sympathy that constant familiarity with general\r\nconditions of misery and suffering does not dull their fineness of\r\nsensibility to the special concerns and interests of particular\r\nindividuals. If he takes his suffering fellow-men at large for his\r\nchildren, his own children will probably suffer just in so far the loss\r\nof a father's special sympathy and understanding care. And likewise he\r\nmust be drawn away and isolated from his friends, for it will be hard\r\nfor him, he must foresee, to hold free and intimate converse with men\r\nwhose ways of thinking lie apart from his own controlling interest and\r\nfor whose insensibility to the things that move him so profoundly he\r\nmust come more and more to feel a certain impatience if not contempt.\r\nNot to enlarge upon these possibilities and others of like nature, we\r\nmust see that reflection upon the situation must presently bring to\r\nconsciousness these various consequences of the kind of action which is\r\nproposed and a recognition that the ground of relation between them and\r\nthe action proposed lies in certain qualities and limitations of his own\r\nnature. These latter are for him the general psychological conditions of\r\naction, his \"empirical self,\" the general nature of which he has\r\ndoubtless already come to be familiar with in many former situations\r\nperhaps wholly different in superficial aspect from from the present\r\none.\r\n\r\nNow, just in so far as there is this relation of mutual exclusiveness\r\nbetween the end proposed and certain of the standard ends or modes of\r\nconduct which are involved, judgment will be by the direct or ethical\r\nmethod of adjustment presently to be described. Let us assume\r\naccordingly that a tentative solution of the problem has been reached to\r\nthe effect that a portion of the lawyer's time shall be given to his\r\nprofession and to his family life, and that the remainder shall be given\r\nto a moderate participation in the social propaganda. Over against this\r\ntentative ethical solution, as its warrant in the sense explained above,\r\nwill stand in the survey of the situation that may now be taken a\r\ncertain fairly definite disposition or _Anlage_ of the capacities and\r\nfunctions of the empirical self.[137] Now on the basis of the ethical\r\nsolution thus reached there will be further study of the situation,\r\nperhaps as a result of failure in the attempt to carry the solution into\r\npractice, but more probably as a further preparation for overt action.\r\nForthwith it develops that the compromise proposed will be impossible.\r\nParticipation in the social agitation will excite hostility on the part\r\nof the classes from which possible clients would come and will cause\r\ndistrust and a suspicion of inattention to details of business among the\r\nlawyer's present clientage. There are, in a word, a whole assemblage of\r\n\"external\" sociological conditions (and we need not stop to speak of\r\nphysical conditions which co-operate with these and contribute to their\r\neffect) which effectually veto the plan proposed. In general these\r\nexternal conditions are such as to deprive the agent of the means of\r\nliving in the manner which the ethical determination of the end\r\nproposes. In the present case, unless some other more feasible\r\ncompromise can be devised, either the one extreme or the other must be\r\nchosen--either continuance in the profession and the corresponding\r\ngeneral scheme of life or the social propaganda and reliance upon such\r\nscant and precarious income as it may incidentally afford.\r\n\r\nWe can now define the economic aspect of a situation in terms of our\r\npresent illustration. The end which the lawyer had in view in a vague\r\nand tentative way was, as we saw, defined with reference to his ethical\r\nstandards--that is to say, a certain measure of participation in the new\r\nwork was determined as satisfactory at once to his ideals of devotion to\r\nthe cause of social justice and to his sense of obligation to himself\r\nand to his family. In this sense, logically speaking, a subject was\r\ndefined to which a system of predicates, comprehended perhaps under the\r\ngeneral predicate of right or good, applies. Now, however, it appears,\r\nfrom the inspection of the material and social environment, that the\r\nexecution of this purpose, perfectly in accord though it may be with the\r\nspiritual capacities and powers of the agent, is possible only on pain\r\nof certain other consequences, certain other sacrifices, which have not\r\nhitherto been considered. That a half-hearted interest in his profession\r\nwould still not prevent his earning a moderate income from it was never\r\nquestioned in the ethical \"first approximation\" to a final decision, but\r\nnow the issue is fairly presented, and, as we must see, in a very\r\ndifficult and distressing way; for the essence of the situation is that\r\nthe ends now in conflict, that of earning a living and caring for his\r\nfamily and that of laboring for the social good, are not intrinsically\r\n(that is, from the standpoint of the empirical self) incompatible. On\r\nthe contrary, these two ends are psychologically quite compatible, as\r\nthe outcome of the ethical judgment shows; only the \"external\"\r\nconditions oppose them to each other. The difficulty of the case lies,\r\nthen, just in the fact that the conflicting ends, both standing, as they\r\ndo, for strong personal interests of the self, nevertheless cannot be\r\nbrought to an adjustment by the direct method of an apportionment\r\nbetween them of the \"spiritual resources\" or \"energies\" of the self.\r\nInstead, the case is one calling for an apportionment of the external\r\nmeans, and so, proximately, not for immediate determination of the final\r\nend, but for economic determination of the means.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the task of describing, so far as this may be possible,\r\nthe judgment or valuation-processes which correspond to the types of\r\nsituation thus distinguished. We are able now to see that these must be\r\nconstructive processes, in the sense that in and through them courses of\r\nconduct adapted to unique situations are shaped by the concourse of\r\nestablished standards with a new end which has arisen and put in its\r\nclaim for recognition. We can see, moreover, that these\r\nvaluation-processes effect a construction of a different order from that\r\ngiven in factual judgment. Factual judgment determines external objects\r\nas means or conditions of action from standpoints suggested by the\r\nanalysis and development of ends. Judgments of valuation determine\r\nconcrete purposes from standpoints given in recognized general purposes\r\nof the self--purposes which are general in virtue of their having been\r\ntaken by abstraction from concrete cases, in which they have received\r\nparticular formulation as purposes, and set apart as typical modes of\r\nconduct in general serviceable to the \"energetic\" self.[138] Logically\r\nfactual judgment is at all times subordinate to valuational; when\r\nvaluational judgment has become consciously deliberate, this logical\r\nsubordination becomes explicit and factual judgment appears in its true\r\ncharacter. Its essential function is that of presenting the conditions\r\nwhich sanction and stimulate our ethically and economically determined\r\npurposes.[139] Finally, in the construction of purposes and\r\nreconstruction of standards in valuation the ideal of the expansion and\r\ndevelopment of the \"energetic\" self controls--not as a \"presented\" or\r\ncontentual self prescribing particular modes of conduct, but as a\r\nprinciple prescribing the greatest possible openness to suggestion and\r\nan impartial application of the method of valuation to the case in hand.\r\nAs we have said, in whatever sensuous image we figure the \"energetic\"\r\nself, its essential character lies in its function of stimulating\r\nmethodical valuation. In place of the two-faced and ambiguous\r\n\"presented\" self, which is characteristic of the stage of conscience, we\r\nnow have in the stage of valuation the \"energetic\" self on the one hand\r\nand standards on the other.[140]\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the actual procedure of valuation, and first the\r\nethical form as above defined. Bearing in mind that we are not concerned\r\nwith cases of obedience to authority or deference to conscience, let us\r\ntake a case of genuine moral conflict such as we were considering some\r\ntime since. Suppose that one has the impulse to indulge in some form of\r\namusement which he has been in the habit of considering frivolous or\r\nabsolutely wrong. The end, as soon as imaged, or rather as the condition\r\nof its being imaged, encounters past habits of conduct symbolized by\r\nstandards--standards which may be presented under a variety of forms, a\r\nmaxim learned in early childhood, the ideal of a Stoic sage or Christian\r\nsaint, the example of some friend, or a precept put in abstract terms,\r\nbut which, however presented, are essentially symbolic of established\r\nhabits of thought or action.[141] Solution of such a problem proceeds,\r\nin general, along two closely interwoven lines: (1) collation and\r\ncomparison of cases recognized as conforming to the standard, with a\r\nview to determining the standard type of conduct in a less ambiguous\r\nway, and (2) definition of the relations between this type of conduct\r\nand other recognized types in the catalogue of virtues.\r\n\r\nNow, these two movements are in fact inseparable, for, without reference\r\nto the entire system of virtues of which the one now asserting itself is\r\na member, the comparison of cases with a view to definition of the\r\nvirtue would be blind and hopeless of any outcome. The agent in the case\r\nbefore us desires to be temperate in amusement and to make profitable\r\nuse of leisure time, but after all he may wonder whether these ideals\r\nreally require the austerities of certain mediæval saints or the Stoic\r\n_ataraxy_. The saint's feats of spiritual athletics may have served a\r\nuseful purpose, in ruder times, as evidence of human power to lead a\r\nvirtuous and thoughtful life, but can such self-denial now be required\r\nof the moral man? It is apparent, in short, that the superficially\r\nconceived ideal must be analyzed. We must consider the \"spirit\" of our\r\nsaint or hero, not the letter of his conduct, as we say, and in\r\ninterpreting it make due allowance for the conditions of the time in\r\nwhich he lived and the grade of general intelligence of those he sought\r\nto edify. Whether our standard is a person or a parable or an abstractly\r\nformulated precept, the logic of the situation is the same in every case\r\nof judgment. The analysis of a standard cannot proceed without the\r\n\"synthesis\" or co-ordination of the type of conduct thereby defined with\r\nother distinguishable recognized types of conduct into a comprehensive\r\nideal of life as a whole. In the last resort the implicit relations of\r\nall the virtues will be made explicit in the process of defining\r\naccurately any one of them.\r\n\r\nIn the last resort, then, the predicate of the ethical judgment is the\r\nwhole system of the recognized habits of the agent, and each\r\njudgment-process is in its outcome a readjustment of the system to\r\naccommodate the new habit that has been seeking admission. Both the old\r\nhabits and the new impulse have been modified in the process just as the\r\nintension of a class term and the particular \"subsumed\" under the class\r\nare reciprocally modified in the ordinary judgment of sense-perception.\r\nWe are once more able to see that the process of ethical judgment or\r\nvaluation is not a process of subsumption or classification, of\r\n_ascertaining_ the value of particular modes of conduct, but on the\r\ncontrary a process of determining or _assigning_ value. Each judgment\r\nprocess means a new and more or less thoroughgoing redetermination of\r\nthe self and hence a fixation of the ethical value of the conduct whose\r\nemergence as a purpose gave rise to the process. The moral experience is\r\nnot essentially and in its typical emergencies a _recognition_ of values\r\nwith a view to shaping one's course accordingly, but rather a\r\ndetermining or a _fixation_ of values which shall serve for the time\r\nbeing, but be subject at all times to re-appraisal.\r\n\r\nIf the present discussion were primarily intended as a contribution to\r\ngeneral ethical theory, it would be a part of our purpose to show in\r\ndetail that any formulation of an ethical ideal in contentual \"material\"\r\nterms must always be inadequate for practical purposes and hence\r\ntheoretically indefensible. This, as we believe, could be shown true of\r\nthe popularly current ideal of self-realization as well as of hedonism\r\nin its various forms and the older systems of conscience or the moral\r\nsense. These all are essentially fixed ideals admitting of more or less\r\ncomplete specification in point of content and regarded as tests or\r\ncanons by appeal to which the moral quality of any concrete act can be\r\ndeductively ascertained. They are the ethical analogues of such\r\nmetaphysical principles as the Cartesian God or the Substance of\r\nSpinoza, and the logic implied in regarding them as adequate standards\r\nfor the valuation of conduct is the logic whereby the Rationalist\r\nsought to deduce from concepts the world of particular things. The\r\npresent desideratum in ethical theory would appear to be, not further\r\nattempts at definition of a moral ideal of any sort, but the development\r\nof a logical method for the valuation of ideals and ends in which the\r\nresults of more modern researches in the theory of knowledge should be\r\nmade use of--in which the concept of self should play the part, not of\r\nthe concept of Substance in a rationalistic metaphysics,[142] but of\r\nsuch a principle as that of the conservation of energy, for example, in\r\nscientific inference.[143]\r\n\r\nWe have, then, in each readjustment of the activities of the self a\r\nreconstruction in knowledge of ethical reality--a reconstruction which\r\nat the same time involves the assignment of a definite value to the new\r\nmode of conduct which has been worked out in the readjustment. We\r\nconclude, then, that the ethical experience is one of continuous\r\nconstruction and reconstruction of an order of objective reality, within\r\nwhich the world of sense-perception is comprised as the world of more or\r\nless refractory means to the attainment of ethical purposes. In this\r\nprocess of construction of ethical reality current moral standards play\r\nthe same part as concepts already defined--that is to say, the agent's\r\npresent habits--do in the typical judgment of sense-perception. They\r\nplay the part of symbols suggestive of recognized and heretofore\r\nhabitual modes of action with reference to conduct of the type of the\r\nparticular instance that is under consideration, serving thus to bring\r\nto bear upon the subject of the judgment sooner or later the entire\r\nmoral self. The outcome is a new self, and so for the future a new\r\nstandard, in which the past self as represented by the former standard\r\nand the new impulse have been brought to mutual adjustment. Our position\r\nis that this adjustment is essentially experimental and that in it the\r\n_general principle_ of the unity and expansion of the self must be\r\npresupposed, as in inductive inference general principles of teleology,\r\nof the conservation of energy, and of organic interconnection of parts\r\nin living things are presupposed. The unity and increase of the self is\r\nnot a test or canon, but a principle of moral experimentation.[144]\r\n\r\nFinally, we must note one further parallel between ethical judgment and\r\nthe judgment of sense-perception and science. However the man of science\r\nmay, as a nominalist, regard the laws of nature as mere observed\r\nuniformities of fact and particulars as the true realities, these same\r\nlaws will nevertheless on occasion have a distinctly objective character\r\nin his actual apprehension of them. The stubbornness with which a\r\ncertain material may refuse to lend itself to a desired purpose will\r\ncommonly be reinforced, as a matter of apprehension, by one's\r\nrecognition of the \"scientific necessity\" of the phenomenon. As offering\r\nresistance the thing itself, as we have seen, becomes objective; so also\r\ndoes the law of which this case may be recognized as only a particular\r\nexample--and the other type of objectivity experience we need not here\r\ndo more than mention as likewise possible in one's apprehension of the\r\nlaw as well as of the \"facts\" of nature. Both types of objectivity\r\nattach to the moral law as well. The standard that restrains is one\r\n\"above\" us or \"beyond\" us. Even Kant, as the similitude of the starry\r\nheavens would suggest, was not incapable of a faint \"emotion of the\r\nheteronomous,\" and authority in one form or another is a moral force\r\nwhose objective validity as moral, both in its inhibiting and in its\r\nsanctioning aspects, human nature is prone to acknowledge. The\r\napprehension of objectivity is everywhere, as we have held, emotional.\r\nOne type of situation in which the moral law takes on this character is\r\nfound in the interposition of the law to check a forward tendency; the\r\nother is found in the instant of transition from doubt to the new\r\nadjustment that has been reached. In the one case the law is\r\n\"inexorable\" in its demands. In the other case there are two\r\npossibilities: If the adjustment has been essentially a rejection of the\r\nnew \"temptation,\" the law which one obeys is one no longer inexorable,\r\nbut sustaining, as a rock of salvation. If the adjustment is a\r\ndistinctly new attitude, the sense of the objectivity of the principle\r\nembodied in it will commonly be less strong, if not for the time being\r\nalmost wholly wanting; but in the moment of overt action it will in some\r\ndegree wear the character of a firm truth upon which one has taken his\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nThis general view of the logical constitution of the moral experience\r\nmay suggest a comparison with the fundamental doctrine of the British\r\nIntellectualist school. The Intellectualist writers were very largely\r\nguided in their expositions by the desire of refuting on the one hand\r\nHobbes and on the other Shaftesbury and Hutcheson. Against Hobbes they\r\nwished to establish the obligatory character of the moral law entirely\r\napart from sanction or enactment by political authority. Against the\r\nSentimentalists they wished to vindicate its objectivity and permanence.\r\nThis twofold purpose they accomplished by holding that the morality of\r\nconduct lies in its conformity to the \"objective nature of things,\" the\r\nknowledge of which, in its moral aspects, is logically deducible from\r\ncertain moral axioms, self-evident like those of mathematics. Now this\r\nmathematical analogy is the key to the whole position of the\r\nIntellectualist writers. By so conceiving the nature of knowledge these\r\nmen seriously weakened their strong general position. Mathematics is\r\njust that species of knowledge which is most remote from and apparently\r\nindependent of any reference to conduct, and the Intellectualists, by\r\nchoosing it as their ideal, were thereby rendered incapable of\r\nexplaining the obligatoriness of the moral law. An adequate psychology\r\nof knowledge would have obviated this difficulty in their system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occasion for economic judgment is given, as we have seen, in a\r\nconflict between ends not incompatible, in view of any ascertainable\r\nconditions of the agent's nature as an empirical self, but inhibitory of\r\neach other in view of what we have described as conditions external to\r\nthe agent. Thus the lawyer in our illustration found his plan of\r\ncompromise thwarted by the existence of such sociological conditions as\r\nwould make the practice of his profession, in the manner intended,\r\nimpossible, and so cut off his income. Similarly the peasant in a\r\nEuropean country finds that (for reasons which, more probably, he does\r\nnot understand) he can no longer earn a living in the accustomed way,\r\nand emigrates to a country in which his capital and his physical\r\nenergies may be more profitably employed. So also in the everyday lives\r\nof all of us ends and interests quite disparate, so far as any relation\r\nto each other through our psychical capacities is concerned, stand very\r\nfrequently in opposition, nevertheless, and calling for adjustment. We\r\nmust make a choice between amusement or intellectual pursuits or the\r\nmeans of æsthetic culture, on the one hand, and the common necessaries\r\nof life on the other, and the difficulty of the situation lies just in\r\nabsence of any sort of \"spiritual affinity\" between these ends. There is\r\nno necessary ratio between the satisfaction of the common needs of life\r\nand the cultivation of the higher faculties--no ratio for which the\r\nindividual can ever find a sanction in the constitution of his empirical\r\nself through the direct method of ethical valuation. The common needs\r\nmust have their measure of recognition, but no attempted ethical\r\nvaluation of them can ever come to a result convincingly warranted to\r\nthe \"energetic\" self by psychological conditions. The economic situation\r\nas such is in this sense (that is, from the standpoint of any recognized\r\nethical standards) unintelligible. It is this ethical unintelligibility\r\nthat often lends a genuine element of tragedy to situations which press\r\nurgently and in which the ends at issue are of great ethical moment. It\r\nis no small matter to the emigrant, for example, that he must cut the\r\nvery roots by which he has grown to the sort of man he finds himself to\r\nbe. His whole nature protests against this violence, and questions its\r\nnecessity, though the necessity is unmistakable and it would be quite\r\nimpossible for him not to act accordingly. Nevertheless, tragic as such\r\na conflict may well be, it does not differ in any logically essential\r\nway, does not differ in its degree of strictly logical difficulty, from\r\nthe ethically much less serious economic problems of our everyday life.\r\n\r\nNow, we have already defined the economic act for which economic\r\njudgment is preparatory as being, in general terms, the diversion of\r\ncertain means from a present use to which they have been devoted to a\r\nnew use which has come to seem in a general way desirable.[145] Thus, in\r\nthe cases just mentioned, the lawyer contemplates the virtual purchase\r\nof his new career by the income which his profession might in years to\r\ncome afford him, the emigrant seeks a better market for his labor, and\r\nthe pleasure-seeker and the ambitious student and the buyer of a\r\ncommodity in the market propose to themselves, each one, the diversion\r\nfrom some hitherto intended use of a sum of money. Manifestly it is\r\nimmaterial from our logical point of view whether the means in question\r\nwhich one proposes to apply in some new way are in the nature of\r\nphysical and mental strength, or materials and implements of manufacture\r\nready to be used, or means of purchase of some sort wherewith the\r\ndesired service or commodity may be obtained at once. The economic\r\nproblem, to state it technically, is the problem of the _reapplicability\r\nof the means_, interpreting the category of means quite broadly.\r\n\r\nIn a word, then, the method of procedure adapted to the economic type of\r\nsituation is that of valuation of the means, not that of direct\r\nvaluation of the ends. This method is one of valuation since, like the\r\nethical method, it is determinative of a purpose, but it accomplishes\r\nthis result in its own distinctive way. The problem of our present\r\nanalysis will accordingly be how this method of valuation of the means\r\nis able to help toward an adjustment of disparate or unrelated ends\r\nwhich the ethical method is inadequate to effect.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that a vague purpose of foreign travel, for example, has\r\npresented itself in imagination, and that the preliminary stage of\r\nethical judgment has been passed through, with the result that the\r\npurpose, in a more definite form than it could have at first, is now\r\nready for economic consideration. In the first place the cost of the\r\njourney must be determined, and this step, in terms of our present point\r\nof view, is simply a methodological device whereby certain ends which\r\nthe standards involved in the stage of ethical judgment could not\r\nsuggest or could not effectually take into co-operation with themselves\r\nin their determination of the end are brought into play. Ascertaining\r\nthe means suggests these disparate ends, these established modes of use\r\nof the means, with the result that the agent's \"forward tendency\" is\r\nchecked. Shall the necessary sums be spent in foreign travel or shall\r\nthey be spent in the present ways--in providing various physical\r\nnecessities and comforts, or for various forms of amusement, or in\r\nincreasing investments in business enterprises? These modes of use do\r\nnot admit of ethical comparison with the plan of foreign travel, and the\r\nagent's interest must therefore now be centered on the means.\r\n\r\nIt is in this check to the agent's forward tendency that the logical\r\nstatus of the means is evinced. As merely so much money the means could\r\nonly serve to further the execution of the purpose that is forming,\r\nsince under the circumstances it could only prompt immediate\r\nexpenditure. Like the subject in factual judgment, the means in economic\r\njudgment have their problematic aspect which as effectually hinders the\r\ndesired use of them as could any palpable physical defect. This\r\nproblematic aspect consists in the fact of the present established mode\r\nof use which the now-forming purpose threatens to disturb, and it is the\r\nagent's interest in this mode of use that turns his attention to the\r\nvaluation of the means.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be pointed out that in the economic life we find\r\nsituations exactly corresponding to those of \"conscience and temptation\"\r\nand mechanical \"pull and haul\" which were discriminated in the ethical\r\nsphere and marked off from judgment properly so called. Indeed it seems\r\nreasonable to think, on general grounds of introspection, that these\r\nmethods of decision (if they deserve the name) are, relatively speaking,\r\nmore frequently relied upon in the economic than in the moral life. The\r\neconomic method of true judgment is roundabout and more complex and more\r\ndifficult than ethical, and involves a more express recourse to those\r\nabstract conceptions which for the most part are only implicitly\r\ninvolved in valuation of the other type. The economic type of valuation,\r\nin fact, differs from the ethical, not in an absolute or essential way,\r\nbut rather in the explicitness with which it brings to light and lays\r\nbare the vital elements in valuation as such. In general, then, the\r\neconomic process would seem necessarily to embrace three stages, which\r\nwill first of all be enumerated and then very briefly explained and\r\ndiscussed. These are: (1) a preliminary consideration of the means\r\nnecessary to attain the end--which must be vague and tentative, of\r\ncourse, for the reason that the end as imagined is so, as compared with\r\nthe fulness of detail which must belong to it before it can be finally\r\naccepted; (2) a consideration of the means, as thus provisionally taken,\r\nin the light of their present devotion to other purposes, this present\r\ndevotion of them being the outcome, in some degree at least, of past\r\nvaluation; (3) final definition of the means with reference to the\r\nproposed use through an adjustment effected between this and the factors\r\ninvolved in the past valuation.\r\n\r\n1. In the first stage as throughout, it must be carefully noted, the\r\nmeans are under consideration not primarily in their physical aspect,\r\nbut simply as _subject to a possible redisposition_. Thus it is not\r\nmoney as lawful currency receivable at the steamship office for an ocean\r\npassage, nor tools and materials and labor-power technically suitable\r\nfor the production of a desired object, that is the subject of the\r\neconomic judgment. The problem of redisposition would of course not be\r\nraised were the means not technically adaptable to the purpose, nor on\r\nthe other hand can the means in the course of economic judgment, as a\r\nrule, escape some measure of further (factual) inquiry into their\r\ntechnical properties; but the standpoints are nevertheless distinct.\r\nAgain, it must be noted that the means in this first stage will be only\r\nroughly measured. The length of one's stay abroad, the size of the\r\nhouse one wishes to build, the purpose whatever it may be, is still\r\nundefined--these are in fact the very matters which the process must\r\ndetermine--and in the first instance it is \"money in general\" or \"a\r\nlarge sum of money\" with reference to which we raise the economic\r\nproblem. The category of quantity is in fact essentially an economic\r\none; it is essentially a standpoint for determining the means of action\r\nin such a way as to facilitate their economic valuation. The reader\r\nfamiliar with the writings of the Austrian school of economists will\r\neasily recall how uniformly in their discussions of the principle of\r\nmarginal utility these writers assume outright in the first place the\r\ndivision of the stock of goods into definite units, and then raise the\r\nquestion of how the value of a unit is measured. The stock contains\r\nalready a hundred bushels of wheat or ten loaves of bread--apparently as\r\na matter of metaphysical necessity--whereas in fact the essential\r\neconomic problem is this very one of how \"wheat at large\" comes to be\r\nput in sacks of a certain size and \"bread in general\" to be baked in\r\ntwelve-ounce loaves. The subdivision of the stock and the valuation of\r\nthe unit are not successive stages, but inseparably correlative phases\r\nof the valuation-process as a whole. The outcome may be stated either\r\nway, in accordance with one's interest in the situation.\r\n\r\n2. But the unmeasured means as redisposable in an as yet undetermined\r\nway bring to consciousness established measured uses to which the means\r\nhave been heretofore assigned in definite amounts. In this way the\r\nprocess of determining a definite quantum as redisposable (which is to\r\nsay, of attaining to a definite acceptable plan of conduct) can begin.\r\nHow, then, does this fact of past assignment to uses still recognized as\r\ndesirable figure in the situation? In the first place the past\r\nassignment may have been (1) an outcome of past economic valuation, (2)\r\nan unhesitating or non-economic act executive of an ethical decision,\r\nor (3) an act of more or less conscious obedience to \"conscience\" or\r\n\"authority.\" In either case it now stands as a course of conduct which\r\nat the time was, in the way explained above, _sanctioned_ to the\r\nagent, to the \"energetic\" self, by the means and conditions recognized\r\nas bearing upon it. In this sense, then, we have, in this recognition\r\nof the past adjustment and of the economic character which the\r\nmeans now have in virtue of it, what we may term a judgment of\r\n\"energy-equivalence\" between the means and their established uses. For\r\nto the agent it was the essential meaning of the sense of sanction felt\r\nwhen the means were assigned to these uses that the \"energetic\" self\r\nwould on the whole be furthered thereby--and this in view of all the\r\nsacrifices that this use would entail, or in view of the sacrifices\r\nrequired for the production of the means, if the case were one in which\r\nthe means were not at hand and could only be secured by a more or less\r\nextended production process.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration we have been considering, it will be observed, there\r\nis an extensive schedule of present uses which the new project calls in\r\nquestion and from which the means must be diverted. This is in fact the\r\ncommoner case. A new use of money will affect, as a rule, not simply a\r\nsingle present mode of expenditure, but will very probably involve a\r\nreadjustment throughout the whole schedule of expenditure which our\r\nseparate past valuations of money have in effect co-operated in\r\nestablishing. So likewise if we wish to use part of a store of building\r\nmaterials or of food, or of any other subdivisible commodity, we\r\nencounter an ordered system of consumption rather than a single\r\npredetermined use which we have not yet enjoyed. Where this is the case\r\nthe whole process of valuation is greatly facilitated, but this is not\r\nessential. The means in cases of true economic valuation may be capable\r\nof but a single use, like a railroad ticket or a perishable piece of\r\nfruit, or of a virtually endless series of uses, like a painting or a\r\nliterary masterpiece. Whether the means figure as representing but a\r\nsingle use or stand for the conservation of an extensive system, their\r\neconomic significance is the same. They are the \"energy-equivalent\" of\r\nthis use or system of uses considered as an act or system of acts of\r\nconsumption in furtherance of the self. Their past assignment meant then\r\nand means now simply this, that the \"energetic\" self would thereby gain\r\nmore than it would lose through the inevitable sacrifices. This is the\r\neconomic significance of the means in virtue of which they are now\r\nproblematic to the extent of checking, for a time at least, forward\r\ntendency toward the desired end.[146]\r\n\r\n3. The judgment of energy-equivalence, then, defines the inhibiting\r\neconomic aspect of the means, and moreover defines it for the means as\r\nsubdivided and set apart for a schedule of uses if this was the form of\r\nthe past adjustments to which reference is made. The problem of the\r\nthird stage of the process is that of \"bringing subject and predicate\r\ntogether,\" as we have elsewhere expressed it--that is, of determining,\r\nin the light of the economic character of the means as just ascertained,\r\nwhat measure of satisfaction, if any, may be accorded to the new and as\r\nyet undefined desire. The new disposition of the means, if one is to be\r\nmade, must bring to the \"energetic\" self a degree of furtherance and\r\ndevelopment which shall be sensibly as great as would come from the\r\nestablished method of consumption. The means, as economic, are means to\r\nthe conservation of the old adjustment, and any new disposal of them or\r\nof any portion of them for a full or partial execution of the new\r\npurpose must make out at least as good a case. It must appear that the\r\nnew disposition is not only physically possible, but also economically\r\nnecessary in the light of the same principle of expansion of the self as\r\nsanctioned the disposition now in force. It must make the self in some\r\nway more efficient--whether more strong and symmetrical in body, more\r\nskilled in work, more clear of brain, or more efficient in whatever\r\nother concrete way may be desired.\r\n\r\nPsychologically the sanction of any course of action which is taken as\r\nevidence of conformity to the general rule thus inadequately stated is\r\nthe more or less strong sense of \"relaxation\" of attentive strain which\r\ncomes with the shift of attention, in the final survey, from means to\r\nend. We may accordingly, for the sake of greater definiteness, restate\r\nin the following terms the process which has just been sketched: The\r\nends in conflict at the outset are ends which do not sensibly bear upon\r\neach other through their dependence upon a common fund of psychical\r\ncapacities or energies. They are related in the agent's experience\r\nsolely through their dependence upon a common stock of physical means,\r\nand they do not therefore admit of adjustment through the ethical type\r\nof process. The economic process consists essentially of a revival in\r\nimagination of the experiences accompanying the former disposition of\r\nthe means and a re-enforcement by these of the means in their adherence\r\nto that former and still recognized disposition. If an adapted form of\r\nthe new end can be imagined which will mediate a like experience of\r\nrelaxation when the attention shifts from the means, thus emotionally\r\nre-enforced in their economic status, to the end as thus conceived, the\r\nmeans will be recognized as economically redisposable. Thus the method\r\nof valuation of the means makes possible, through appeal to the\r\nsensibly invariable experience of relaxation or assurance in the outcome\r\nof judgment, a co-ordination of disparate ends which the ethical method\r\nof direct adjustment could not effect.[147]\r\n\r\nThe economic process thus presents on analysis the same factors as does\r\nthe ethical. On the subject side we have the means--which as economic\r\nare problematic as to their reapplicability. On the predicate side we\r\nhave the suggested mode of reapplication in tension against conservative\r\nideals of application to established purposes. Just as it may be held\r\nthat the general ethical predicate is that of Right or Good--that is,\r\ndeserving of adoption into the system of one's ends--so the economic\r\npredicate applied to the means as these come in the end to be defined is\r\nthe general concept Reappliable. And in general the distinction of the\r\ntypes is not an ultimate one, for the more deliberately and rigorously\r\nthe method of economic valuation is pursued--in such a case, for\r\nexample, as that of the prospective emigrant--the stronger will be the\r\nagent's sense of a genuinely ethical sanction as belonging to the\r\ndecision which is in the end worked out. The more certain and sincere,\r\ntherefore, will be the agent's judgment that the means must be\r\nreapplied, for on the sense of sanction of which we speak rests the\r\nexplicit judgment that the purpose formed is expansive of the self.\r\n\r\nFrom the analysis thus presented it must appear, therefore, that the\r\neconomic type of judgment is in our sense a constructive process. Its\r\nfunction is to determine a particular commodity or portion of a stock of\r\nsome commodity in its economic character as _disposable_, and in\r\nperforming this function it presents a definite reality in the economic\r\norder. Moreover, in thus defining the particular, recourse is had to\r\nmore or less distinctively namable economic standards which are in the\r\nlast resort symbols representing established habits of consumption in\r\nthe light of which the means, _prima facie_, seem not to be available\r\nfor any other purposes. These economic standards, like ethical standards\r\nand the class concepts of science and our ordinary perceptual\r\nexperience, are, with all due respect to nominalism, constitutive of a\r\nreal world--a world which is real because it lends form and significance\r\nto our knowledge of particulars as stimuli to conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now before us sufficient reason for our thesis that the\r\nvaluation-process in both its forms is constructive of an order of\r\nreality, and we have sufficiently explained the relation which the\r\neconomic order bears to the inclusive and logically prior order of\r\nethical objects and relations. We are now in a position to see that in\r\nbeing thus constructive of reality (taking the conception in its proper\r\nfunctional meaning) they are at the same time constructive of the self,\r\nsince the reality which they construct is in its functional aspect the\r\nassemblage of means and conditions, of stimuli, in short, for the\r\ndevelopment and expansion of the self. We shall bring this main division\r\nof our study to a close with a series of remarks in explanation and\r\nillustration of this view.\r\n\r\nLet us consider once more the factors present in the agent's final\r\nsurvey of the situation after the completion of the judgment-process and\r\non the verge of action. These factors are, as we have seen, (1)\r\nrecognition of conditions sanctioning the purpose formed, (2)\r\nrecognition of the purpose as, in view of this sanction, warranted to\r\nthe \"energetic\" self as an eligible method of expansion and development,\r\nand (3) recognition of the \"energetic\" self, conversely, as in\r\npossession, in virtue of the favorable conditions given in factual\r\njudgment, of this new method of furtherance. These three factors are\r\nmanifestly not so much factors co-operating in the situation as\r\ninseparable aspects of it distinguishable from each other and admitting\r\nof discriminative emphasis in accordance with the degree of reflective\r\npower which the individual may possess or choose to exercise. Strictly\r\nspeaking these three aspects are present in every conscious recognition\r\nof a purpose as one's own and as presently to be carried into effect,\r\nbut they are not always present in equal conspicuousness, and never with\r\nequal logical importance for the individual. In fact this enumeration of\r\naspects coincides with our enumeration of the three stages in the\r\nevolution of the individual's conscious moral attitude toward new\r\npurposes given in impulse--in the third of which the last named of these\r\naspects comes to the fore with the others in logical or functional\r\nsubordination to it.\r\n\r\nNow it will be apparent on grounds of logic, as on the evidence of\r\nsimple introspection, that in this third type of attitude--in the\r\nattitude of true valuation, that is to say--the energetic self cannot be\r\nidentified with the chosen purpose. The purpose is a determinate\r\nspecified act to be performed subject to recognized conditions, and with\r\nthe use of the co-ordinated means; the self, on the other hand, is a\r\nprocess to which this particular purpose is, indeed, from the standpoint\r\nof the self's conservation and increase, indispensable, but which is\r\nnevertheless apart from the purpose in the sense that without the\r\npurpose it would still be a self, though perhaps a narrower and less\r\ndeveloped one. Our standpoint here as elsewhere, the reader must\r\nremember, is the logical. It is the standpoint of the agent's own\r\ninterpretation of his experience of judgment during the judgment-process\r\nand at its close, and not the standpoint of the psychological mediation\r\nof this experience as a series of occurrences. Thus we are here far from\r\nwishing to deny the general proposition that a man's purposes are an\r\nexpression of his nature, as the psychologist might describe it, or the\r\nproposition that a man's conduct and his character are one and the same\r\nthing viewed from different points of view. We wish merely to insist\r\nupon the fact that these psychological propositions are not a true\r\naccount of the agent's own experience of himself and of his purposes\r\n_while these latter are in the making or are on the verge of execution_.\r\nThere is indeed no conflict between this \"inside view\" of the\r\njudgment-process and of the final survey and the psychological\r\npropositions just mentioned. The identity of conduct and character means\r\nnot simply that as the man is so does he act, but quite as much, and in\r\na more important way, that as he acts so is he and so does he become. It\r\nis, then, the essence of the agent's own view of the situation that his\r\ncharacter is in the making and that the purpose is the method to be\r\ntaken. To the agent the self is not, indeed, independent of the purpose,\r\nfor plainly it is recognized that upon just this purpose the self is, in\r\nthe sense explained, in a vital way dependent. Nevertheless the self is\r\nin the agent's apprehension essentially beyond the purpose, and larger\r\nthan the purpose, and even, we may say, metaphysically apart from it.\r\nNow the conclusion which we wish to draw from this examination of the\r\nagent's attitude in judgment is that no formulation of an ideal self can\r\never be adequate to his purposes, not simply because any such\r\nformulation must, as Green allows, inevitably be incomplete and\r\ninconsistent, but because the self as a process is in the agent's own\r\napprehension of it inherently incapable of formulation. Any formulation\r\nthat might be attempted must be in terms of particular purposes (since\r\nin a modern ethical theory the self must be a \"concrete\" and not an\r\nabstract universal), and it is easy to see that any such would be, to\r\nthe agent in the attitude of true ethical judgment, worse than useless.\r\nIt could as contentual and concrete only be a composite of existing\r\nstandards, more or less coherently put together, offered to the agent as\r\na substitute for the new standard which he is trying to work out. If\r\nthere were not need of a new standard there would be no\r\njudgment-process; the agent must be, to say the least, embarrassed, even\r\nif the unwitting imposture does not deceive him, when such a composite,\r\nuseful and indeed indispensable in its proper place as a standard of\r\nreference and a source of suggestion, is urged upon him as suitable for\r\na purpose which in the very nature of the case it is logically incapable\r\nof serving.[148]\r\n\r\nTo the agent, then, the \"energetic\" self can never be represented as an\r\nideal--can never be expressed in terms of purpose--since it is in its\r\nvery nature logically incongruous with any possible particular purpose\r\nor generalization of such purposes. It is commonly imaged by the agent\r\nin some manner of sensuous terms, but it is imaged, in so far as the\r\ncase is one of judgment in a proper sense, for use as a stimulus to the\r\nmethodical process of valuation--not as a standard, which if really\r\nadequate would make valuation unnecessary. The agent's consciousness of\r\nhimself as \"energetic\" cannot be an ideal; it comes to consciousness\r\nonly through the endeavor, first to follow, and then, in a later stage\r\nof moral development, to use ideals, and has for its function, as a\r\npresentation, the incitement of the process of methodical use of\r\nstandards in the control of the agent's impulsive ends. It is not an\r\nanticipatory vision of the final goal of life, but the agent's coming to\r\nconsciousness of the general impulse and movement of the life that is.\r\n\r\nIt is an inevitable consequence of acceptance of a contentual view of\r\nthe \"energetic\" self as one's ideal that reflective morality should tend\r\nto degenerate into an introspective conscientiousness constantly in\r\nunstable equilibrium between a pharisaical selfishness on the one hand\r\nand a morally scarcely more dangerous hypocrisy on the other. There is\r\ncertainly much justice in the stinging characterization of \"Neo-Hegelian\r\nEgoism\" which Mr. Taylor somewhere in his unsearchable book applies to\r\nthe currently prevailing conventionalized type of idealistic ethics. If\r\nthe self of the valuation-process is an ultimate goal of effort, then\r\nthere must certainly be an irreconcilable contrast to the disadvantage\r\nof the latter between the plain man's objective desire for right\r\nconduct, as such, and for the welfare of his fellow-beings, and the\r\nmoralist's anxious questionings of the rectitude of the motives by which\r\nhis conformity to the fixed moral standard are prompted.[149] Into the\r\nvalue and significance of the attitude of conscientious examination of\r\none's moral motives we are not here concerned to inquire, but need only\r\ninsist, in accordance with our present view, that its value must be\r\ndistinctly subordinate and incidental to the general course and outcome\r\nof the valuation-process. In the valuation-process, consciousness of\r\nself is not an object of solicitude, but simply, we repeat, a pure\r\npresentation of stimulus, having for its office the incitement, and if\r\nneed be the reincitement, of the attitude of deference to the\r\nsuggestions of old standards and openness to the petitions of new\r\nimpulse, and of methodically bringing these to bear upon each other.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of such a process, of course, cannot be predicted--and for\r\nthe same reasons as make unpredictable the scientist's factual\r\nhypothesis. Just as the scientist's data are incomplete and ill-assorted\r\nand unorganized, for the reason that they have, of necessity, been\r\ncollected, and must at the outset be interpreted, in the light of\r\npresent concepts, whose inadequacy the very existence of the problem at\r\nissue demonstrates, so the final moral purpose that shall be developed\r\nis not to be deduced from any possible inventory of the situation as it\r\nstands. The process in both cases is one of reconstruction, and the test\r\nof the validity of the reconstruction must in both cases be of the same\r\nessentially practical character. In both cases the process is\r\nconstructive of reality, in the functional signification of the term. In\r\nboth, the judgment process is constructive also of the self, in the\r\nsense that upon the determination of the agent's future attitude the\r\ncumulative outcome of his past attitudes is methodically brought to\r\nbear.[150]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nJudgments of value are, then, objective in their import in the same\r\nsense as are the factual judgments in which the conditions of action are\r\npresented. The ideal problematic situation is, in the last resort,\r\nethical, in the sense of requiring for its solution determination of the\r\nnew end that has arisen with reference to existing standards. In\r\nstructure and in function the judgment in which the outcome of this\r\nprocess is presented is knowledge, and objective in the only valid\r\nacceptation of the term.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, it may be urged, is it not the essential mark of the\r\nobjective that it should be accessible to all men, and not in the nature\r\nof the case valid for only a single individual? At best the objectivity\r\nof content which has been made out for the judgment of value is purely\r\nfunctional, and not such as can be verified by appeal to the consensus\r\nof other persons. The agent's _assurance_ of the reality of the economic\r\nor ethical subject-matter which he is endeavoring to determine, and his\r\nsense of the objectivity of the results which he reaches, need not be\r\ndenied. These may well enough be illusions of personal prejudice or\r\npassion, or even normal illusions of the reflective faculty, like that\r\nof interpreting the secondary qualities of bodies as objective in the\r\nsame sense as are the \"bulk, figure, extension, number, and motion of\r\ntheir solid parts.\"[151] Any man can see the physical object to which I\r\npoint, and verify with his own eyes the qualities which I ascribe to it,\r\nbut no man can either understand or verify my judgment that the purpose\r\nI have formed is in accord with rational ideals of industry and\r\nself-denial, or that this portion of my winter's fuel may be given to a\r\nneighbor who has none.\r\n\r\nBut this line of objection proves too much, for, made consistent with\r\nitself, it really amounts to a denial that the very judgment of\r\nsense-perception, to which it appeals so confidently as a criterion, has\r\nobjective import. The first division of this study was intended to show\r\nthat every object in the experience of each individual is for the\r\nindividual a unique construction of his own, determined in form and in\r\ndetails by individual interests and purposes, and therefore different\r\nfrom that object in the experience of any other individual which in\r\nsocial intercourse passes current as the same. The real object is for me\r\nthe object which functions in my experience, presenting problematic\r\naspects for solution, and lending itself more or less serviceably to my\r\npurposes; and this object is, we hold, not the object as socially\r\ncurrent, but the complete object which, as complete in its determination\r\nwith reference to my unique purposes, cannot possibly have social\r\ncurrency. The objection as stated cuts away the very ground on which it\r\nrests, since the shortcoming which it finds in the judgment of ethical\r\nor economic value is present in the particular judgment of\r\nsense-perception also. The object about which I can assure myself by an\r\nimmediate appeal to other persons is the object in its bare \"conceptual\"\r\naspects--the object as a dictionary might define it, the commodity as it\r\nmight be described in a trade catalogue, or the ethical act as defined\r\nby the criminal code or in the treatise of a moral philosopher. It is an\r\nobject consisting of a central core or fixed deposit of meaning, which\r\nrenders it significant in a certain general way to a number of persons,\r\nor even to all men, but which is not yet adequately known by me from the\r\nstandpoint of my present forming purpose. In virtue of these conceptual\r\ncharacters it is adaptable to my purpose, which is as yet general and\r\nindeterminate; but in the nature of the case it cannot yet be known to\r\nme as applicable to my prospective concrete purpose, as this shall come\r\nto be through judgment.\r\n\r\nThus, if the test of objectivity of import is to be that the judgment\r\nshall present an object or a fact which, as presented, is socially\r\ncurrent among men and not shut away in the individual intelligence\r\napart from the possibility of social verification, then the apparent\r\nnominalism of the objection we are considering turns out to be the\r\nuttermost extreme of realism. Such a test amounts to a virtual\r\naffirmation that the sole objective reality is the conceptual, and that\r\nthe \"accidents\" of one's particular object of sense-perception are the\r\narbitrary play of private preference or fancy. At this point, however,\r\nthe objection may shift its ground and take refuge in some such position\r\nas the following: The real object is indeed the object which the\r\nindividual knows in relation to his particular purpose, and it is indeed\r\nimpossible that the individual's judgment should be limited in its\r\ncontent to coincidence with the conceptual elements of meaning which are\r\nsocially current. The building-stone which one has judged precisely fit\r\nfor a special purpose, the specimen which the mineralogist or the\r\nbotanist examines under his microscope, the tool whose peculiarity of\r\nworking one has learned to make allowance for in use--these all are, of\r\ncourse, highly individual objects, possessing for the person in question\r\nan indefinite number of objective aspects of which no other person can\r\npossibly be conscious at the time. And, more than this, even though the\r\nindividual may, in his scrutiny of the object, have discovered no\r\nconspicuous new qualities in it which were not present in the socially\r\ncurrent meaning, the object will still possess an individuality making\r\nit genuinely unique merely through its co-ordination with other objects\r\nin the mechanical process of working out the purpose in hand. It is at\r\nleast an object standing here at just this time, a tool cutting this\r\nparticular piece of stone and striking at this instant with this\r\nparticular ringing sound, and these perhaps wholly nonessential facts\r\nwill nevertheless serve to individualize the object (if one chances to\r\nthink of them) in the sense of making it such a one as no other person\r\nknows. All this may be granted, the objection may allow, and yet the\r\nvital point remains; for this is not what it was intended, even in the\r\nfirst place, to deny. The vital point at issue is not whether the object\r\nwhich I know _is_ known as I know it by any other person, but whether,\r\nin the nature of things, it is one that _can_ be so known.\r\n\r\nHerein, then, lies the difference between judgments of fact and\r\njudgments of value. The mineralogist can train his pupil to see\r\nprecisely what he himself sees; and so likewise in any case of\r\nsense-perception, the object, however recondite may be the qualities or\r\nfeatures which one may see in it, _can_ nevertheless be seen by any\r\nother person in precisely the same way on the single, more often not\r\ninsuperably difficult, condition that the discoverer shall point these\r\nout or otherwise prepare the other for seeing them. But with the ton of\r\ncoal which one may judge economically disposable for a charitable\r\npurpose the case stands differently, since it is not in its visible or\r\nother physical aspects that the ton of coal is here the subject of the\r\njudgment. It is as having been set apart _by oneself exclusively_ for\r\nother uses that the ton of coal now functions as an object and now\r\npossesses the character which the economic judgment has given it; and\r\nthe case stands similarly with a contemplated act, of telling the truth\r\nin a trying situation. The valuation placed upon the commodity or upon\r\nthe moral act depends essentially upon psychological conditions of\r\ntemperament, disposition, mood, or whim into which it would be\r\nimpossible for another person to enter, and these depend upon conditions\r\nof past training and native endowment which can never occur or be\r\ncombined in future in precisely the same way for any other individual.\r\nIn short, the physical object is _describable_ and _can_ be made\r\nsocially current, though doubtless with more or less of difficulty, if\r\nother persons will attend to it and learn to see it as I see it; but the\r\nvalue of an economic object or a moral act depends upon my desires and\r\nfeelings, and therefore must remain a matter of my private appreciation.\r\n\r\nIn answering this amended form of the objection it is entirely\r\nunnecessary to discuss the issue of fact which it has raised as to\r\nwhether or not complete description of a physical object or event is a\r\npractical or theoretical possibility. It need only be pointed out that\r\nat best such complete description can only be successful in its purpose\r\non condition that the individual upon whom the experiment is tried be\r\nwilling to attend and have the requisite \"apperceptive background.\" The\r\naccuracy with which another person's knowledge shall copy the knowledge\r\nwhich I endeavor to impart to him must manifestly depend upon these two\r\nleading conditions, not to mention also the measure of my own\r\npedagogical and literary skill. Any consideration of such a purely\r\npsychological problem as is here suggested would be entirely out of\r\nplace in a discussion the purpose of which is not that of analyzing the\r\nprocess of judgment, but that of interpreting its meaning aspects. Let\r\nus grant the entire psychological possibility of making socially current\r\nin the manner here suggested the most highly individual and concrete\r\ncognition of an object one may please, and let us grant, moreover, that\r\nthis possibility has been actually realized. This concurrent testimony\r\nof the witness will doubtless confirm one's impression of the accuracy\r\nof the process of observation and inference whereby the knowledge which\r\nhas been imparted was first gained, but we must deny that it can do more\r\nthan this. For indeed, apart from some independent self-reliant\r\nconviction of the objective validity of the knowledge in question, how\r\nshould another's assent be taken as _confirmation_ and not rather as\r\nevidence of one's own mere skill in suggestion and of the other's\r\nsusceptibility thereto? We must deny that even in the improved form the\r\ncriterion of social currency is a valid one. In a word, the social\r\ncurrency of knowledge to the extent to which it can exist requires as\r\nits condition, and is evidence of, the equal social currency of certain\r\ninterests, purposes, or points of view for predication; and if it be\r\npossible to make socially current an item of concrete knowledge, with\r\nall its concrete fulness of detail, then _a fortiori_ it must be\r\npossible to make socially current the concrete individual purpose with\r\nreference to which this item of knowledge first of all took form.\r\nWhether such a thing be psychologically possible at all the reader may\r\ndecide; but if it be possible in the sphere of knowledge of fact, then\r\nit must be possible in the sphere of valuation. In short, judgment in\r\neither field, in definition of a certain object or commodity or moral\r\nact as, for the agent, an objective fact possessing certain characters,\r\ninvolves the tacit assumption of social verifiability as a matter of\r\ncourse; but it does not rest upon this assumption, nor is this\r\nassumption the essence of its meaning. To say that my judgment is\r\nsocially verifiable, that my concrete object of perception or of\r\nvaluation would be seen as I see it by any person in precisely my place,\r\nis merely a tautological way of formally announcing that _I have made\r\nthe judgment_ and have now a definite object which to me has a certain\r\ndefinite functional meaning.\r\n\r\nThus, instead of drawing a distinction between the realms of fact and\r\nvalue, as between what is or can be common to all intelligent beings and\r\nwhat must be unique for each individual one, we must hold that the two\r\nrealms are coextensive. The socially current object answers to a certain\r\ngeneral type of conscious purpose or interest active in the individual\r\nand so to a general habit of valuation, and the concrete object to a\r\nspecial determination of this type of purpose with reference to others\r\nin the recognized working system of life. The agent's final attitude, on\r\nthe conclusion of the judgment-process, may be expressed in either sort\r\nof judgment--in a judgment of the value of commodity or moral purpose,\r\nor in a judgment of concrete fact setting forth the \"external\"\r\nconditions which warrant the purpose to the \"energetic\" self. Throughout\r\nthe judgment-process there is a correlation between the movement whereby\r\nthe socially current object develops into the adapted means and that\r\nwhereby the socially current type of conduct develops into the defined\r\nand valued purpose.[152]\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, a second general objection presents itself.\r\nHowever individual the content of my knowledge of physical fact may be,\r\nand however irrelevant, from the logical point of view, to my confidence\r\nin its objective validity may be the possibility of sharing it with\r\nother persons, nevertheless it refers to an object which is in some\r\nsense permanent, and therein differs from my valuations. In economic\r\nvaluation I reach a definition of a certain commodity and am confirmed\r\nin it by all the conditions that enter into my final survey of the\r\nsituation. But my desire for the new sort of consumption may fail, and\r\nso expose my valuation to easy attack from any new desire that may\r\narise; or my supply of the commodity in question may be suddenly\r\nincreased or diminished, and my valuation of the unit quantity thereby\r\nchanged. Likewise my ethical valuation may have to be reversed (as Mr.\r\nTaylor has insisted) by reason of a change of disposition or particular\r\ndesire which makes impossible, except in obedience to some other and\r\ninclusive valuation, further adherence to it. And these changes take\r\nplace without any accompanying sense of their doing violence to\r\nobjective fact or, on the other hand, any judgment of their being in\r\nthe nature of corrections of previous errors in valuation, and so more\r\nclosely in accordance with the truth. Moreover, a new valuation, taking\r\nthe place of an old, does not supplement its predecessor as one set of\r\njudgments about a physical object may supplement another, made from a\r\ndifferent point of view, but does literally take its place, and this\r\nwithout necessarily condemning it as having been erroneous.\r\n\r\nThis general objection rests upon a number of fairly obvious\r\nmisconceptions, and its strength is apparent only. In the first place,\r\nthe question of the objectivity of any type of judgment must in the end,\r\nas we have seen, reduce itself to a question of the judgment's import to\r\nthe agent. However the agent's valuations may shift from time to time,\r\neach several one will be sanctioned to the agent by the changed\r\nconditions exhibited in the inventory which the agent takes at the close\r\nof judgment which has formed it. The conditions have changed, and the\r\nvaluation of the earlier purpose has likewise changed; but the new\r\npurpose is sanctioned by the new conditions, and the test of the\r\npresumed validity of the new valuation can only be in the manner already\r\ndiscussed[153] the test of actual execution of the purpose. In the\r\nchange, as the agent interprets the situation, there is no violation of\r\nthe former purpose nor a nearer approach to truth. Each valuation is\r\ntrue for the situation to which it corresponds. We are obviously not\r\nhere considering the case of error. An error in valuation is evidenced\r\nto the agent, not by the need of a new valuation answering to changed\r\nconditions, but by the failure of a given valuation to make good its\r\npromise, although to all appearance conditions have remained unchanged.\r\nIf the conditions have changed, then the purpose and the conditions\r\n_must_ be redetermined, if the expansion of the \"energetic\" self is to\r\ncontinue; but the former valuation does not thereby become untrue.\r\n\r\nThese brief remarks should suffice by way of answer, but it will serve\r\nadvantageously to illustrate our general position if we pursue the\r\nobjection somewhat farther. The physical object is, nevertheless,\r\n_permanent_, it will be said, and this surely distinguishes it from the\r\nobject (now freely acknowledged as such) of the value-judgment. To one\r\nman gold may be soluble in _aqua regia_ and to another worth so many\r\npence an ounce, but different and individual as are these judgments and\r\nthe standpoints they respectively imply, the gold is _one_, impartially\r\nadmitting at the same time of both characterizations. On the other hand,\r\none cannot judge an act good and bad at once. The purpose of deception\r\nthat may be good is one controlled and shaped by ideals quite different\r\nfrom those which permit deception of the evil sort--is, in truth, taken\r\nas a total act, altogether different from the purpose of deception which\r\none condemns, and not, like the \"parcel of matter\" in the two judgments\r\nabout gold, the subject of both valuations.\r\n\r\nA brief consideration of the meaning of this \"parcel of matter\" will\r\neasily expose the weakness of the plea. In the last analysis the \"parcel\r\nof matter\" must for the agent reduce itself, let us say, to certain\r\ncontrollable energies centering about certain closely contiguous points\r\nin space and capable, in their exercise, of setting free or checking\r\nother energies in the system of nature. Thus, put in _aqua regia_ the\r\ngold will dissolve, but in the atmosphere it retains its brilliant\r\ncolor, and in the photographer's solution its energies have still a\r\ndifferent mode of manifestation. And thus it would appear that the\r\nvarious predicates which are applied to \"gold\" imply, each one, a unique\r\nset of conditions. Gold is soluble in _aqua regia_, but not if it is to\r\nretain its yellow luster; which predicate is to be true of it depends\r\nupon the conditions under which the energies \"resident in the gold\" are\r\nto be set free, just as the moral character of an act depends upon the\r\nsocial conditions obtaining at the time of its performance--that is,\r\nupon the ideals with reference to which it has been shaped in judgment.\r\nHow can one maintain that in a literal and concrete physical sense gold\r\nin process of solution is the \"same\" as gold entering into chemical\r\ncombination? Surely the energy conditions which constitute the \"gold\" in\r\nthe two processes are not the same--and can one nowadays hope to find\r\nsameness in unchangeable atoms?[154]\r\n\r\nIn a word, the permanent substance or \"real essence\" that admits of\r\nvarious mutually supplementary determinations corresponding to diverse\r\npoints of view is, strictly speaking, a convenient abstraction, and not\r\nan existent fact in time--and we shall maintain that the same species of\r\nabstraction has its proper place, and in fact occurs, in the sphere of\r\nmoral judgment. The type of moral conduct that in every actual case of\r\nits occurrence in the moral order is determined in some unique and\r\nspecial way by relation to other standards is precisely analogous to the\r\n\"substance\" that is now dissolved in _aqua regia_ and now made to pass\r\nin the form of current coin, but cannot be treated in both ways at once.\r\nBoth are abstractions. The \"gold\" is a name for the general possibility\r\nof attaining any one of a certain set of particular ends by\r\nappropriately co-ordinating certain energies, resident elsewhere in the\r\nphysical system, with those at present stored in this particular \"parcel\r\nof matter;\" the result to be attained depends not alone upon the \"parcel\r\nof matter,\" but also upon the particular energies brought to bear upon\r\nit from without. Now let us take a type of conduct which is sometimes\r\njudged good and sometimes bad. Deception, for example, is such a\r\ntype--and as a type it simply stands for the general possibility of\r\nfurtherance or detriment to the \"energetic\" self according as it is\r\ndetermined in the concrete instance by ideals of social well-being or by\r\nconsiderations of immediate personal advantage.\r\n\r\nFor the type-form of conduct--when considered, not as a type of mere\r\nphysical performance, but as conduct in the technical sense of a\r\npossible purpose of the self--is, in the sense we have explained, a\r\nsymbol for the general possibility of access or dissipation of spiritual\r\nenergy--energy which must be set free by the bringing to bear of other\r\nenergies upon it, and which furthers or works counter to the enlargement\r\nand development of the self according to the mode of its co-ordination\r\nwith other energies which the self has already turned to its\r\npurposes.[155] But actual conduct is concrete always and never typical;\r\nand so likewise, we have sought to show, actual \"substance,\" the\r\nobjective thing referred to in the factual judgment, is always concrete\r\nand never an essence. It is not a fixed thing admitting of a\r\nsimultaneous variety of conflicting determinations and practical uses,\r\nbut absolutely unique and already determined to its unique character by\r\nthe whole assemblage of physical conditions which affect it at the time\r\nand which it in turn reacts upon. In the moral as in the physical sphere\r\nthe fundamental category would, on our present account, appear to be\r\nthat of energy. The particular physical object given in judgment is a\r\nconcrete realization, in the form of a particular means or instrument,\r\nof that general possibility of attaining ends which the concept of a\r\nfixed fund of energy, interpreted as a logical postulate or principle of\r\ninference, expresses. The particular moral or economic act is a\r\nparticular way in which the energy of the self may be increased or\r\ndiminished. In both spheres the reality presented in the finished\r\njudgment is objective as being a stimulus to the setting free of the\r\nenergies for which it stands. Once more, then, our answer to the\r\nobjection we have been considering must be that the object as the\r\npermanent substrate is merely an abstract symbol standing for the\r\nindeterminate means in general set over against the self. Corresponding\r\nto it we have, on the other side, the concept of the \"energetic\"\r\nself--the self that is purposive in general, expansive somehow or other.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe function of completed factual judgment in the development of\r\nexperience is, we have held, that of warranting to the agent the\r\ncompleted purpose which his judgment of value expresses. This view calls\r\nfor some further comment and illustration in closing the present\r\ndivision. In the first place the statement implies that the conditions\r\nwhich factual judgment presents in the \"final survey\" as sanctioning the\r\npurpose have not _determined_ the purpose, since prior to the\r\ndetermination of the purpose the conditions were not, and could not be,\r\nso presented. The question, therefore, naturally arises whether our\r\nmeaning is that in the formation of our purposes in valuation the\r\nrecognition of existing conditions plays no part. Our answer can be\r\nindicated only in the barest outline as follows:\r\n\r\nThe agent must, of course, in an economic judgment-process, recognize\r\nand take account of such facts as the technical adaptability of the\r\nmeans he is proposing to use to the new purpose that is forming, as also\r\nof environing conditions which may affect the success which he may meet\r\nwith in applying them. He must consider also his own physical strength\r\nand qualities of mind with a view to this same technical problem. And\r\nsimilarly in ethical valuation, as we have seen, the psychology of the\r\n\"empirical ego\" must play its part. But the conditions thus recognized\r\nare, as we might seek to show more in detail, explainable as the outcome\r\nof past factual judgment-processes, and on the occasion of their\r\noriginal definition in the form in which they now are known played the\r\nsanctioning part of which we have so often spoken. They therefore\r\ncorrespond to the agent's accepted practical ideals, so that the control\r\nwhich his past experience exercises over his present conduct may be\r\nstated equally well in either sort of terms--in terms of his prevailing\r\nrecognized standards, or in terms of his present knowledge of the\r\nconditions which his new purpose must respect. Thus, in general, the\r\nconcept of a physical order conditioning the conduct of all men and\r\npresented in a definite body of socially current knowledge is the\r\nlogical correlate of the moral law conceived as a categorical imperative\r\nprescribing certain types of conduct.\r\n\r\nThus the error of regarding the agent's conduct in a present emergency\r\nas an outcome of existing determining conditions is logically identical\r\nwith the corresponding error of the ethical theory of self-realization.\r\nThe latter holds the logical possibility of a determinate descriptive\r\nideal (already realized in the unchanging Absolute Self) which is\r\nadequate to the solution of all possible ethical problems. The former\r\nholds that all conduct must be subject to the determining force of\r\nexternal conditions which, if not at present completely known, are at\r\nleast in theory knowable. The physical universe in its original nebulous\r\nstate contained the \"promise and potency\" of all that has been in the\r\nway of human conduct and of all that is to be. Into the fixed mechanical\r\nsystem no new energy can enter and from it none of the original fund of\r\nenergy can be lost. This mechanical theory of conduct is the essential\r\nbasis of the hedonistic theory of ethics; and it would not be difficult\r\nto show that Green's criticism of this latter and his own affirmative\r\ntheory of the moral ideal (as also the current conventional criticism of\r\nhedonism in the same tenor by the school of Green) are in a logical\r\nsense identical with it. For the assumption that conduct is determined\r\nby existing objective conditions is precisely the logical correlate of\r\nthe concept of a contentual and \"realizable\" ideal moral self.[156]\r\n\r\nWe may now interpret, in the light of our general view of the function\r\nof factual judgment, the concept of the \"empirical self\" referred to in\r\nour discussion of the various types of sanctioning condition which may\r\nenter into the \"final survey.\" The \"empirical self\" of psychological\r\nscience is a construction gradually put together by psychologist or\r\nintrospective layman as an interpretation of the way in which accepted\r\nconcrete modes of conduct, in the determination of which standards have\r\nbeen operative, have worked out in practice to the furtherance or\r\nimpoverishment of the \"energetic\" self. We have seen that the ambiguous\r\npresented self which functions in the moral attitude of obedience to\r\nauthority or to conscience gives place in the attitude of conscious\r\nvaluation to apprehension of the \"energetic\" self, on the one hand, and\r\ndescriptive concepts of particular types of conduct, on the other. The\r\n\"empirical self\" at the same time makes its appearance as a constantly\r\nexpanding inventory of the \"spiritual resources\" which the \"energetic\"\r\nself has at its disposal. These are the functions of the soul which a\r\nfunctional psychology shows us in operation--powers of attention,\r\nstrength of memory, fertility in associative recall, and the like--and\r\nthese are the resources wherewith the \"energetic\" self may execute, and\r\nso exploit to its own furtherance, the purposes which, in particular\r\nemergencies, new end and recognized standards may work out in\r\nco-operation.[157]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages we have consistently used the expressions\r\n\"ethical and economic judgment\" and \"judgment of valuation\" as\r\nsynonymous. This may have seemed to the reader something very like a\r\nbegging of the question from the outset, as taking for granted that very\r\njudgmental character of our valuational experience which it was the\r\nprofessed object of our discussion to establish. We are thus called upon\r\nvery briefly to consider, first of all, the relations which subsist\r\nbetween the consciousness of value and the process which we have\r\ndescribed as that of valuation. This will enable us, in the second\r\nplace, to determine the logical function which belongs to the\r\nconsciousness of value in the general economy of life. The consciousness\r\nof value is a perfectly definite and distinctive psychical fact mediated\r\nby a doubtless highly complex set of psychical or ultimately\r\nphysiological conditions. As such it admits of descriptive analysis, and\r\nin a complete theory of value such descriptive analysis should certainly\r\nfind a place. It would doubtless throw much light upon the origin of\r\nvaluation as a process, and of valuing as an attitude, and admirably\r\nillustrate the view of the function of the consciousness of value to\r\nwhich a logical study of valuation as a process seems to lead us. This\r\nproblem in analysis belongs, however, to psychology, and therefore lies\r\napart from our present purpose; nor is it necessary to the establishment\r\nof our present view to undertake it. It is necessary for our purpose\r\nonly to suggest, for purposes of identification, a brief description of\r\nthe value-consciousness, and to indicate its place in the process of\r\nreflective thought.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of value may best be described, by way of first\r\napproximation, in the language of the Austrian economists as a sense of\r\nthe \"importance\" to oneself of a commodity or defined moral purpose. It\r\nbelongs to the agent's attitude of survey or recapitulation which ensues\r\nupon the completion of the judgment-process and is mediated by attention\r\nto the ethical or economic object in its newly defined character of\r\nspecific conduciveness to the well-being of the self. The commodity, in\r\nvirtue of its ascertained physical properties, is adapted to certain\r\nmodes of use or consumption which, through valuation of the commodity,\r\nhave come to be accepted as desirable. The moral act likewise has been\r\napproved by virtue of its having certain definite sociological\r\ntendencies, or being conducive to the welfare and happiness of a friend.\r\nThus commodity or moral act, as the case may be, has a determinate\r\ncomplexity of meaning which has been judged as, in one sense, expansive\r\nof the self, and the value-consciousness we may identify as that sense\r\nof the valued object's importance which is mediated by recognition of it\r\nas the bearer of this complexity of concrete meaning. The meaning is, as\r\nwe may say, \"condensed\" or \"compacted\" into the object as given in\r\nsense-perception, and because the meaning stands for expansion of the\r\nself, the object in taking it up into itself receives the character of\r\nimportance as a valued object.\r\n\r\nThe sense of importance thus is expressive of an attitude upon the\r\nagent's part. The concrete meanings which make up the content of the\r\nobject's importance would inevitably, if left to themselves, prompt\r\novert action. The commodity would forthwith be applied to its new use or\r\nthe moral act would be performed. The self would, as we may express it,\r\npossess itself of the spiritual energies resident in the chosen purpose.\r\nThe attitude of survey, however, inhibits this action of the self and\r\nthe sense of importance is the resulting emotional apprehension of the\r\nvalue of the object hereby brought to recognition. Now, it should be\r\ncarefully observed that the particular concrete emotions appropriate to\r\nthe details of the valued purpose are not what we here intend. The\r\npurpose may spring from some impulse of self-interest, hatred,\r\npatriotism, or love, and the psychical material of its presentation\r\nduring the agent's survey will be the varied complex of qualitative\r\nemotion that comes from inhibition of the detailed activities which make\r\nup the purpose as a whole. So also the apprehension of the physical\r\nobject of economic valuation is largely, if not altogether, emotional in\r\nits psychical constitution. Psychologically these emotions are the\r\npurpose--they are the \"stuff\" of which the purpose as a psychical fact\r\noccurring in time is made. But we must bear in mind that it is not the\r\npurpose as a psychical fact that is the object of the agent's\r\nvaluing--any more than is the tool with which one cuts perceived as a\r\nmolecular mass or as an aggregation of centers of ether-stress. As a\r\ncognized object of value the purpose is, in our schematic terminology, a\r\nsource of energy for the increase of the self, and thus the\r\nconsciousness of value is the perfectly specific emotion arising from\r\nrestraint put upon the self in its movement of appropriation of this\r\nenergy. In contrast with the concrete emotions which are the substance\r\nof the purpose as presented, the consciousness of value may be called a\r\n\"formal\" emotion or the emotion of a typical reflective attitude.\r\n\r\nThe valuing attitude we may then describe as that of \"resolution\" on the\r\npart of the self to adhere to the finished purpose which it now surveys,\r\nwith a view to exploitation of the purpose. The connection between the\r\nvaluation-process and the consciousness of value may be stated thus: The\r\nvaluation-process works out (and necessarily in cognitive, objective\r\nterms) the purpose which is valued in the agent's survey. But this\r\ndevelopment of the purpose is at the same time determination of the\r\n\"energetic\" self to acceptance of the purpose that shall be worked out.\r\nThus the valuation-process is the source of the consciousness of value\r\nin the twofold way (1) of defining the object valued, and (2) of\r\ndetermining the self to the attitude of resolution to adhere to it and\r\nexploit it.[158] The consciousness of value is the apprehension of an\r\nobject in its complete functional character as a factor in experience.\r\n\r\nThe function of the consciousness of value must now be very briefly\r\nconsidered. The phenomenon is a striking one, and apparently, as the\r\neconomists especially have insisted, of much practical importance in the\r\nconduct of life.[159] And yet on our account of the phenomenon, as it\r\nmay appear, the problem of assigning to it a function must be, to say\r\nthe least, difficult. For the consciousness of value is, we have held,\r\nemotional, and, on the conception of emotion in general which we have\r\ntaken for granted throughout our present discussion, this mode of being\r\nconscious is merely a reflex of a state of tension in activity. As such\r\nit merely reports in consciousness a process of motor co-ordination\r\nalready going on and in the nature of the case can contribute nothing to\r\nthe outcome.\r\n\r\nNow if it were in a direct way as immediately felt emotion that the\r\nconsciousness of value must be functional if functional at all, then the\r\nproblem might well be given up; but it would be a serious blunder to\r\nconceive the problem in this strictly psychological way. A logical\r\nstatement of the problem would raise a different issue--not the question\r\nof whether emotion as emotion can in any sense be functional in\r\nexperience, but whether the consciousness of value and emotion in\r\ngeneral may not receive reflective interpretation and thereby, becoming\r\nobjective, play a part as a factor in subsequent valuation-processes.\r\nIndeed, the psychological statement of the problem misses the entire\r\npoint at issue and leads directly to the wholly irrelevant general\r\nproblem of whether any mode of consciousness whatever can, _as\r\nconsciousness_, put forth energy and be a factor in controlling conduct.\r\nThe present problem is properly a logical one. What is the agent's\r\napprehension of the matter? In his subsequent reflective processes of\r\nvaluation does the consciousness of value, which was a feature of the\r\nsurvey on a past occasion, receive recognition in any way and so play a\r\npart? This is simply a question of fact and clearly, as a question\r\nrelating to the logical content of the agent's reflective process, has\r\nno connection with or interest in the problem of a possible dynamic\r\nefficacy of consciousness as such. The question properly is logical, not\r\npsychological or metaphysical.\r\n\r\nThus stated, then, the problem seems to admit of answer--and along the\r\nline already suggested in our account of economic valuation.[160]\r\nRecognition of the fact that the consciousness of value was experienced\r\nin the survey of a certain purpose on an earlier occasion confirms this\r\npurpose, holding the means, in an economic situation, to their appointed\r\nuse and strengthening adherence to the standard in the ethical case.\r\nThis recognition serves as stimulus to a reproduction, in memory, of the\r\ncognitive details of the earlier survey, and so in the ideal case to a\r\nmore or less complete and recognizably adequate reinstatement of the\r\nearlier valuing attitude, and so to a reinstatement of the consciousness\r\nof value itself. The result is a strengthening of the established\r\nvaluation, a more efficacious control of the new end claiming\r\nrecognition, and an assured measure of continuity of ethical development\r\nfrom the old valuation to the new. The function thus assigned to the\r\nconsciousness of value finds abundant illustration elsewhere in the\r\nfield of emotion. The stated festivals of antiquity commemorative of\r\nregularly recurrent phases of agricultural and pastoral life, as also\r\nthe festivals in observance of signal events in the private and\r\npolitical life of the individual, would appear to find, more or less\r\ndistinctly, here their explanation. These festivals must have been\r\nprompted by a more or less conscious recognition of the social value\r\ninherent in the important functions making up the life of the community,\r\nand of the individual citizen as a member of the community and as an\r\nindividual. They secured the end of a sustained and enhanced interest in\r\nthese normal functions by effecting, through a symbolic reproduction of\r\nthese, an intensified and glorified experience of the emotional meaning\r\nnormally and inherently belonging to them.[161] In the same way the\r\nrites of the religious cults of Greece, not to mention kindred phenomena\r\nso abundantly to be found in lower civilizations as well as in our own,\r\nserved to fortify the individual in a certain consistent and salutary\r\ncourse of institutional and private life.[162]\r\n\r\nIt has been taken for granted throughout that there are but two forms of\r\nvaluation-process, the ethical and the economic. The reason for this\r\nlimitation may already be sufficiently apparent, but it will further\r\nillustrate our general conception of the valuation-process briefly to\r\nindicate it in detail. What shall be said, for example, of the common\r\nuse of the term \"value\" in such expressions as the \"value of life,\" the\r\n\"emotional value\" of an object or a moral act, the \"natural value\" of a\r\ntype of impulsive activity? In these uses of the word the reference is\r\napparently to one's own incommunicable inner experience of living, of\r\nperception of the object, or of the impulse, which cannot be suggested\r\nto any other person who has not himself had the experience. My pleasure,\r\nmy color-sensation in its affective aspect, my emotion, are inner and\r\nsubjective, and I distinguish them by such expressions as the above from\r\nthe visible, tangible object to which I ascribe them as constituting its\r\nimmediate or natural value to me. This broader use of the term \"value\"\r\nhas not found recognition in the foregoing pages, and it requires here a\r\nword of comment. So long as these phases of the experience of the object\r\nare not recognized as separable in thought from the object viewed as an\r\nexternal condition or means, they would apparently be better\r\ncharacterized in some other way. If, however, they are so recognized,\r\nand are thereby taken as determinative of the agent's practical attitude\r\ntoward the thing, we have merely our typical situation of ethical\r\nvaluation of some implied purpose as conducive to the self and economic\r\nvaluation of the means as requisites for execution of the purpose. Our\r\ngeneral criterion for the propriety of terming any mode of consciousness\r\nthe _value_ of an object must be that it shall perform a logical\r\nfunction and not simply be referred to in its aspect of psychical fact.\r\nThe feeling or emotion, or whatever the mode of consciousness in\r\nquestion may be, must play the recognized part, in the agent's survey of\r\nthe situation, of prompting and supporting a definite practical attitude\r\nwith reference to the object. If, in short, the experience in question\r\nenters in any way into a conscious purpose of the agent, it may properly\r\nbe termed a value.[163]\r\n\r\nÆsthetic value also has not been recognized, and for the opposite\r\nreason. The sense of beauty would appear to be a correlate of relatively\r\nperfect attained adjustment between the agent and his natural\r\nenvironment or the conditions suggested more or less impressively by the\r\nwork of art. There must, indeed, be present in the æsthetic experience\r\nan element of unsatisfied curiosity sufficient to stimulate an interest\r\nin the changing or diverse aspects of the beautiful object, but this\r\nmust not be sufficient to prompt reflective judgment of the details\r\npresented. On the whole, the æsthetic experience would appear to be\r\nessentially post-judgmental and appreciative. It comes on the particular\r\noccasion, not as the result of a judgment-process of the valuational\r\ntype, but as an immediate appreciation. As an immediate appreciation it\r\nhas no logical function and on our principles must be denied the name of\r\nvalue. Our standpoint must be that of the experiencing individual. The\r\næsthetic experience as a type may well be a development out of the\r\nartistic and so find its ultimate explanation in the psychology of\r\nman's primitive technological occupations in the ordinary course of\r\nlife. It is, as we have said, of the post-judgmental type, and so may\r\nvery probably be but the cumulative outcome of closer and closer\r\napproximations along certain lines to a perfected adjustment with the\r\nconditions of life. It may thus have its origin in past processes of the\r\nreflective valuational type. Nevertheless, viewed in the light of its\r\nactual present character and status in experience, the æsthetic must be\r\nexcluded from the sphere of values.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the realms of fact and value are both real, but that of value is\r\nlogically prior and so the \"more real.\" The realm of fact is that of\r\nconditions warranting the purposes of the self; as a separate order,\r\ncomplete and absolute in itself, it is an abstraction that has forgotten\r\nthe reason for which it was made. Reality in the logical sense is that\r\nwhich furthers the development of the self. The purpose that falls short\r\nof its promise in this regard is unreal--not, indeed, in the\r\npsychological sense that it never existed in imagination, but in the\r\nlogical sense that it is no longer valued. Within the inclusive realm of\r\nreality the realm of fact is that of the means which serve the concrete\r\npurposes which the self accepts. The completed purpose, however, is not\r\n_means_, since still behind and beyond it there can be no other concrete\r\nvalued purpose which it can serve. Nor is it an ultimate _end_, since in\r\nits character of accepted and valued end the self adheres _to_ it, and\r\nit therefore cannot express the _whole_ purpose of the self to whose\r\nunspecifiable fulness and increase of activity it is but a temporary\r\nprobational contributor. It is rather in the nature of a formula or\r\nmethod of behavior to which the self ascribes reality by recognizing and\r\naccepting it as its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nSOME LOGICAL ASPECTS OF PURPOSE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever and wherever it was discovered that the content of experience\r\nas given in immediate perception could be reconstructed through ideas,\r\nthen and there began to emerge such questions as these: What is the\r\nsignificance of this reconstructive power? What is the relation between\r\nit and the immediate experience? What is the relative value of each in\r\nexperience as a whole? What is their relation to truth and error? If\r\nthinking leads to truth, and thought must yet get its material from\r\nperception, how then shall the product of thought escape infection from\r\nthe material? On the other hand, if truth is to be found in the\r\nimmediate experience, can it here be preserved from the blighting\r\neffects of thought? For so insistent and pervasive is this activity of\r\nthought that it appears to penetrate into the sanctum of perception\r\nitself. Turning to a third possibility, if it should be found that truth\r\nand error are concerned with both--that they are products of the\r\ncombined activity of perception and reflection--then just what does each\r\ndo? And what in their operations marks the difference between truth and\r\nerror? Or still again, if truth and error cannot be found in the\r\noperations of perception and reflection as such, then they must be\r\nlocated in the relation of these processes to something else. If so,\r\nwhat is this something else? Out of such questions as these is logic\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nThere may be those who will object to some of these questions as\r\n\"logical\" problems--those who would limit logic to a description of the\r\nforms and processes of reconstruction, relegating the question of the\r\ncriterion of truth and error to \"epistemology.\" This objection we must\r\nhere dismiss summarily by saying that, by whatever name it is called, a\r\ntreatment of the forms and processes of thought must deal with the\r\ncriterion of truth and error, since these different \"forms\" are just\r\nthose which thought assumes in attempting to reach truth under different\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nCertainly in the beginning the Greeks regarded their newly discovered\r\npower of thought as anything but formal. Indeed, it soon became so\r\n\"substantial\" that it was regarded as simply a new world of fact, of\r\nexistence alongside of, or rather above, the world of perception. But\r\nSocrates hailed ideas as deliverers from the contradictions and\r\nparadoxes into which experience interpreted in terms of immediate\r\nsense-perception had fallen. In the concept Socrates found a solution\r\nfor the then pressing problems of social life. The Socratic universal is\r\nnot a mere empty form which thought imposes upon the world. It is\r\nsomething which thought creates in order that a life of social\r\ninteraction and reciprocity may go on. This need not mean that the\r\nGreeks were reflectively conscious of this, but that this was the way\r\nthe concept was actually used and developed by Socrates.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to formulate the relation between this new world of ideas\r\nand immediate sense-experience, Plato constructed his scheme of\r\nsubstantiation and participation. The Platonic doctrine of\r\nsubstantiation and participation is an expression of the conviction that\r\nanything so valuable as Socrates had shown ideas to be could not be\r\nmerely formal or unreal. Up to the discovery of these ideas reality lay\r\nin the \"substances\" of perception. Hence in order to have that reality\r\nto which their worth, their value in life, entitled them, the ideas must\r\nbe substantiated.\r\n\r\nThis introduction of the newly discovered ideas into the world of\r\nsubstances and reality wrought, of course, a change in the conception\r\nof the latter--a change which has well-nigh dominated the entire\r\nphilosophic development ever since. Let us recall that the aim of\r\nSocrates was to find something that would prevent society from going to\r\npieces under the influence of the disintegrating conception of\r\nexperience as a mere flux of given immediate content. Now, in the\r\nconcepts Socrates discovered the basis for just this much-needed\r\nwholeness and stability. Moreover, the fact that unity and stability\r\nwere the actual social needs of the hour led not only to the concepts\r\nwhich furnished them being conceived as substantial and real, but to\r\ntheir being regarded as a higher type of reality, as \"more real\" than\r\nthe given, immediate experiences of perception. They were higher and\r\nmore real because, just then, they answered the pressing social need.\r\n\r\nThe ideas supplied this unity because they furnished ends, purposes, to\r\nthe given material of perception. The given is now given for something;\r\nfor something more, too, than mere contemplation. Socrates also showed,\r\nby the most acute analysis, that the content of these ends, these\r\npurposes, was social through and through.\r\n\r\nFrom the ethical standpoint this teleological character of the idea is\r\nclearly recognized. But as \"real,\" the ideas must be stated in the\r\nmetaphysical terms of substance and attribute. Here the social need is\r\nabstracted from and lost to sight. The fundamental attributes of the\r\nideas are now a metaphysical unity and stability. Hence unity and\r\nstability, wholeness and completeness, are the very essence of reality,\r\nwhile multiplicity and change constitute the nature of appearance. Thus\r\ndoes Plato's reality become, as Windelband says, \"an immaterial\r\neleaticism which seeks true being in the ideas without troubling itself\r\nabout the world of generation and occurrence which it leaves to\r\nperception and opinion.\"[164]\r\n\r\nNow it is the momentum of this conception of reality as a stable and\r\ncomplete system of absolute ideas, the development of which we have just\r\nroughly sketched, that is so important historically. Why this conception\r\nof reality, which apparently grew out of a particular historical\r\nsituation, should have dominated philosophic theory for over two\r\nthousand years appears at first somewhat puzzling. Those who still hold\r\nand defend it will of course say that this survival is evidence of its\r\nvalidity. But, after all, our human world may be yet very young. It may\r\nbe that \"a thousand years are but as yesterday.\" At any rate philosophy\r\nhas never been in a hurry to reconstruct conceptions which served their\r\nday and generation with such distinction as did the Platonic conception\r\nof reality. And this is true to the evolutionary instinct that\r\nexperience has only its own products as material for further\r\nconstruction. On the other hand, the principle of evolution with equal\r\nforce demands that only as _material_, not as final forms of experience,\r\nshall these products continue. It may be that philosophy has not yet\r\ntaken the conception of evolution quite seriously. At all events it is\r\ncertain that long after it has been found that, instead of being eternal\r\nand complete, the concept undergoes change, that it has simply the\r\nstability and wholeness demanded by a particular and concrete situation;\r\nafter it has been discovered, in other words, that the stability and\r\nwholeness, instead of attaching to the content of an idea, are simply\r\nthe functions of any content used as a purpose--after all this has been\r\naccepted in psychology, the conception of truth and reality which arose\r\nunder an entirely different conception of the nature of thought still\r\nsurvives.\r\n\r\nThis change in the conception of the character of the ideas, with no\r\ncorresponding change in the conception of reality, marks the divorce of\r\nthought and reality and the rise of the epistemological problem. Let us\r\nrecall that in Plato the relation between the higher and ultimate\r\nreality, as constituted by the complete and \"Eternal Ideas,\" and the\r\nlower reality of perception, is that of archetype and ectype.\r\nPerceptions attempt to imitate and copy the ideas. Now, when the ideas\r\nare found to be changing, and when further the interpenetration of\r\nperception and conception is discovered, reality as fixed and complete\r\nmust be located elsewhere. And just as in the old system it was the\r\nbusiness of perception to imitate the \"Eternal Ideas,\" so here it is\r\nstill assumed that thought is to imitate the reality wherever now it is\r\nto be located. And as regards the matter of location, the old conception\r\nis not abandoned. The elder Plato is mighty yet. Reality must still be a\r\ncompleted system of fixed and eternal \"things in themselves,\"\r\n\"relations,\" or \"noumena\" of some sort which _our_ ideas, now\r\nconstituted by both perception and conceptional processes, are still to\r\n\"imitate,\" \"copy,\" \"reflect,\" \"represent,\" or at least \"symbolize\" in\r\nsome fashion.\r\n\r\nFrom this point on, then, thought has two functions: one, to help\r\nexperience meet and reorganize into itself the results of its own past\r\nactivity; the other, to reflect or represent in some sense the absolute\r\nsystem of reality. For a very long time the latter has continued to\r\nconstitute the logical problem, the former being relegated to the realm\r\nof psychology.\r\n\r\nBut this discovery of the reconstructive function of the idea and its\r\nassignment to the jurisdiction of psychology did not leave logic where\r\nit was before, nor did it lighten its task. Logic could not shut its\r\neyes to this \"psychological\" character of the idea.[165] Indeed, logic\r\nhad to take the idea as psychology described it, then do the best it\r\ncould with it for its purpose.\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment of logic by this reconstructive character of the idea\r\neven Aristotle discovered to some extent in the relation of the Platonic\r\nperceptions to the eternal ideas. He found great difficulty in getting a\r\nflowing stream of consciousness to imitate or even symbolize an\r\neternally fixed and completed reality. And since we have discovered, in\r\naddition, that the idea is so palpably a reconstructive activity, the\r\ndifficulties have not diminished.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation it could only be a question of time until solutions\r\nof the problem should be sought by attempting to bring together these\r\ntwo functions of the idea. Perhaps after all the representation of\r\nobjects in an absolute system is involved in the reconstruction of our\r\nexperience. Or perhaps what appears as reconstructions of our\r\nexperience--as desiring, struggling, deliberating, choosing, willing, as\r\nsorrows and joys, failures and triumphs--are but the machinery by which\r\nthe absolute system is represented. At any rate, these two functions\r\nsurely cannot be regarded as belonging to the idea as color and form\r\nbelong to a stone. We should never be satisfied with such a brute\r\ndualism as this.\r\n\r\nWithout any further historical sketch of attempts at this synthesis, I\r\ndesire to pass at once to a consideration of what I am sure everyone\r\nwill agree must stand as one of the most brilliant and in every way\r\nnotable efforts in this direction--Mr. Royce's Aberdeen lectures on \"The\r\nWorld and the Individual.\" It is the purpose here to examine that part\r\nof these lectures, and it is the heart of the whole matter, in which the\r\nkey to the solution of the problem of the relation between ideas and\r\nreality is sought precisely in the purposive character of the idea. This\r\nwill be found especially in the \"Introduction\" and in the chapter on\r\n\"Internal and External Meaning of Ideas.\"[166]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE PURPOSIVE CHARACTER OF IDEAS\r\n\r\nWith his unerring sense for fundamentals, Mr. Royce begins by telling us\r\nthat the first thing called for by the problem of the relation of ideas\r\nto reality is a discussion of the nature of ideas. Here Mr. Royce says\r\nhe shall \"be guided by certain psychological analyses of the mere\r\ncontents of our consciousness, which have become prominent in recent\r\ndiscussion.\"[167]\r\n\r\n    Your intelligent ideas of things never consist of mere imagery of\r\n    the thing, but always involve a consciousness of how you propose\r\n    to act toward the thing of which you have ideas.... Complex\r\n    scientific ideas viewed as to their conscious significance are, as\r\n    Professor Stout has well said, plans of action, ways of\r\n    constructing the object of your scientific consciousness.... By\r\n    the word idea, then, as we shall use it, when, after having\r\n    criticised opposing theory, we come to state in these lectures our\r\n    own thesis, I shall mean in the end any state of consciousness,\r\n    whether simple or complex, which when present is then and there\r\n    viewed as at least a partial expression, or embodiment of a single\r\n    conscious purpose.... In brief, an idea in my present definition\r\n    may, and in fact always does, if you please, appear to be\r\n    representative of a fact existent beyond itself. But the _primary_\r\n    character which makes it an idea is _not its representative\r\n    character_, is not its vicarious assumption of the responsibility\r\n    of standing for a being beyond itself, but is its inner character\r\n    as _relatively fulfilling the purpose_, that is as presenting the\r\n    partial fulfilment of the purpose which is in the consciousness of\r\n    the moment wherein the idea takes place.[168]... Now this purpose,\r\n    just in so far as it gets a present conscious embodiment in the\r\n    contents, and in the form of the complex state called the idea,\r\n    constitutes what I shall hereafter call the internal meaning of\r\n    the idea.[169]... But ideas often seem to have a meaning; yes, as\r\n    one must add, finite ideas always undertake or appear to have a\r\n    meaning that is not exhausted by this conscious internal meaning\r\n    presented and relatively fulfilled at the moment when the idea is\r\n    there for our finite view. The melody sung, the artists' idea, the\r\n    thought of your absent friend, a thought on which you love to\r\n    dwell, all these not merely have their obvious internal meaning\r\n    as meeting a conscious purpose by their very presence, but also\r\n    they at least appear to have that other sort of meaning, that\r\n    reference beyond themselves to objects, that cognitive relation to\r\n    outer facts, that attempted correspondence with outer facts, which\r\n    many accounts of our ideas regard as their primary inexplicable\r\n    and ultimate character. I call this second, and for me still\r\n    problematic, and derived aspect of the nature of ideas, their\r\n    apparently external meaning.[170]\r\n\r\nFrom all this it is quite evident that Mr. Royce accepts and welcomes\r\nthe results of the work of modern psychology on the nature of the idea.\r\nThe difficulty will come in making the connection between these accepted\r\nresults and the Platonic conception of ultimate reality as stated in the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    To be means simply to express, to embody the complete internal\r\n    meaning of _a certain absolute system of ideas_. A system,\r\n    moreover, which is genuinely implied in the true internal meaning\r\n    or purpose of every finite idea, however fragmentary.[171]\r\n\r\nIt may be well to note here in passing that, notwithstanding the avowed\r\nsubordination here of the representative to the reconstructive character\r\nof the ideas, the former becomes very important in the chapter on the\r\nrelation of internal to external meaning, where the problem of truth and\r\nerror is considered.\r\n\r\nIn this account of the two meanings of the idea, which I have tried to\r\nstate as nearly as possible in the author's own words, there appear some\r\nconceptions of idea, of purpose, and of their relation to each other,\r\nthat play an important part in the further treatment and in determining\r\nthe final outcome. In the description of the internal meaning there\r\nappear to be two quite different conceptions of the relation of idea to\r\npurpose. One regards the idea as itself constituting the purpose or plan\r\nof action; the other describes the idea as \"the partial fulfilment\" of\r\nthe purpose. (1) \"Complex scientific ideas, viewed as to their\r\nconscious significance, are, as Professor Stout has well said, _plans of\r\naction_.\" (2) \"You sing to yourself a melody; you are then and there\r\nconscious that the melody, as you hear yourself singing it, _partially\r\nfulfils_ and embodies a purpose.\"[172] When we come to the problem of\r\nthe relation between the internal and external meaning, we shall find\r\nthat the idea as internal meaning comes into a third relation to\r\npurpose, viz., that of _having_ the further purpose to agree or\r\ncorrespond to the external meaning. \"Is the correspondence reached\r\nbetween idea and object the precise correspondence that the idea itself\r\nintended? If it is, the idea is true.... Thus it is not mere agreement,\r\nbut intended agreement, that constitutes truth.\"[173] Thus the idea is\r\n(1) the purpose, (2) the partial fulfilment of the purpose, and (3) has\r\na further purpose--to correspond to an object in the \"absolute system of\r\nideas.\"\r\n\r\nThe first statement of the internal meaning as constituting the plan or\r\npurpose is, I take it, the conception of the internal meaning as an\r\nideal construction which gives a working form, a definition to the\r\n\"indefinite sort of restlessness\" and blind feeling of dissatisfaction\r\nout of which the need of and demand for thought arises.[174] This\r\naccords with the scientific conception of the idea as a working\r\nhypothesis. If this interpretation of idea were steadily followed\r\nthroughout, it is difficult to see how it could fail to lead to a\r\nconception of reality quite different from that described as \"a certain\r\nabsolute system of ideas.\"\r\n\r\nThe second definition of internal meaning is the one in which it is\r\nstated as the \"partial expression,\" \"embodiment,\" and \"fulfilment\" of a\r\nsingle conscious purpose, and in which subsequently and consequently the\r\nidea is identified with \"any conscious act,\" for example, singing. The\r\nfirst part of the statement appears to say that the idea of a melody is\r\nin \"partial fulfilment\" of the idea regarded as the purpose to sing the\r\nmelody. But, as the first statement of internal meaning implies, how can\r\none have a purpose to sing the melody except in and through the idea? It\r\nis precisely the construction of an idea that transforms the vague\r\n\"indefinite restlessness\" and dissatisfaction into a purpose. The idea\r\nis the defining, the sharpening of the blind activity of mere sensation,\r\nmere want, into a plan of action.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Royce meets this difficulty at once by the statement that\r\nthe term \"idea\" here not only covers the activity involved in forming\r\nthe idea, _e. g._, the idea of singing, but includes the action of\r\nsinging, which fulfils this purpose. \"In the same sense _any conscious\r\nact_ at the moment when you perform it not merely expresses, but is, in\r\nmy present sense, an idea.\"[175]\r\n\r\nBut this sort of an adjustment between the idea as the purpose and as\r\nthe fulfilment of the purpose raises a new question. What here becomes\r\nof the distinction between immediate and mediating experience? Surely\r\nthere is a pretty discernible difference between experience as a\r\npurposive idea and the experience which fulfils this purpose. To call\r\nthem both \"ideas\" is at least confusing, and indeed it appears that it\r\nis just this confusion that obscures the fundamental difficulty in\r\ndealing, later on, with the problem of truth and error. To be sure, the\r\nvery formation of the idea as the purpose, the \"plan of action,\" is the\r\nbeginning of the relief from the \"indefinite restlessness.\" On the other\r\nhand, it defines and sharpens the dissatisfaction. When this vague\r\nunrest takes the form of a purpose to attain food or shelter, or to sing\r\nin tune, it is of course the first step toward solution. But this very\r\ndefinition of the dissatisfaction intensifies it. The idea as purpose,\r\nthen, instead of being the fulfilment, appears to be the plan, the\r\nmethod of fulfilment. The fulfilling experience is the further\r\nexperience to which the idea points and leads.\r\n\r\nTo follow a little farther this relation between the purposive and\r\nfulfilling aspects of experience, it is of course apparent that the idea\r\nas the purpose, the \"plan of action,\" must as a function go over into\r\nthe fulfilling experience. My purpose to sing the melody must remain, in\r\nso far as the action is a conscious one, until the melody is sung. I say\r\n\"as a function,\" for the specific content of this purpose is\r\ncontinuously changing. The purpose is certainly not the same in content\r\nafter half the melody has been sung as it is at the beginning. This\r\nmeans that the purpose is being progressively fulfilled; and as part of\r\nthe purpose is fulfilled each moment, so a part of the original content\r\nof the idea drops out; and when the fulfilling process of this\r\nparticular purpose is complete, or is suspended--for, in Mr. Royce's\r\nview, it never is complete in human experience--that purpose then gives\r\nway to some other, perhaps one growing out of it, but still one regarded\r\nas another. A purpose realized, fulfilled, cannot persist as a purpose.\r\nWe may desire to repeat the experience in memory; _i. e._, instead of\r\nsinging aloud, simply, as Mr. Royce says, \"silently recall and listen to\r\nits imagined presence.\" But here we must remember that the memory\r\nexperience, as such, is not an idea in the logical sense at all. It is\r\nan immediate experience that is fulfilling the idea of the song which\r\nconstitutes the purpose to recall it, just as truly as the singing aloud\r\nfulfils the idea of singing aloud. Shouting, whistling, or \"listening in\r\nmemory to the silent notes\" may all be equally immediate, fulfilling\r\nexperiences. Doubtless the idea as purpose involves memory, as Mr. Royce\r\nsays.[176] But it is a memory used as a purpose, and it is just this use\r\nof the memory material as a purpose that makes it a logical idea. In\r\nits content the purposive idea is just as immediate and as mechanical as\r\nany other part of experience. \"Psychology explains the presence and the\r\npartial present efficacy of this purpose by the laws of motor processes,\r\nof habit, or of what is often called association.\"[177] Here \"idea,\"\r\nhowever, simply means, as Mr. Royce takes it in his second statement,\r\nconscious content of any sort. But this is not the meaning of \"idea\" in\r\nthe logical sense. The logical idea is a conscious content used as an\r\norganizer, as \"a plan of action,\" to get other contents. If, for\r\nexample, in the course of writing a paper one wishes to recall an\r\nabstract distinction, as the distinction dawns in consciousness, it is\r\nnot an idea in the logical sense. It is just as truly an immediate\r\nfulfilling experience as is a good golf stroke. So in the\r\nmathematician's most abstruse processes, which Mr. Royce so admirably\r\nportrays, the results for which he watches \"as empirically as the\r\nastronomer alone with his star\" are not ideas in the logical sense; they\r\nare immediate, fulfilling experiences.[178] The distinction between the\r\nidea as the mediating experience--that is, the logical idea--and the\r\nimmediate fulfilling experience is therefore not one of content, but of\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThere is a sense, however, in which the idea as a purpose can be taken\r\nas the partial fulfilment of another purpose; in the sense that any\r\npurpose is the outgrowth of activity involving previous purposes. This\r\nbecomes evident when we inquire into the \"indefinite restlessness\" and\r\ndissatisfaction out of which the idea as purpose springs.\r\nDissatisfaction presupposes some activity already going on in attempted\r\nfulfilment of some previous purpose. If one is dissatisfied with his\r\nsinging, or with not singing, it is because one has already purposed to\r\nparticipate in the performance of a company of people which now he finds\r\nsinging a certain melody, or one has rashly contracted to entertain a\r\nstrenuous infant who is vociferously demanding his favorite ditty. This\r\nis only saying that any given dissatisfaction and the purpose to which\r\nit gives rise grow out of activity involving previous purposing. But\r\nthis does not do away with the distinction between the idea as a purpose\r\nand the immediate fulfilling experience.\r\n\r\nIf the discussion appears at this point to be growing somewhat captious,\r\nlet us pass to a consideration of the relation between internal and\r\nexternal meanings, where the problem of truth and error appears, and\r\nwhere the vital import of these distinctions becomes more obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PURPOSE AND THE JUDGMENT\r\n\r\nMr. Royce begins with the traditional definition of truth, which he then\r\nproceeds to reinterpret:\r\n\r\n    Truth is very frequently defined in terms of external meaning as\r\n    _that about which we judge_.... In the second place, truth has\r\n    been defined as the _correspondence between our ideas and their\r\n    objects_[179].... When we undertake to express the objective\r\n    validity of any truth, we use judgment. These judgments, if\r\n    subjectively regarded, that is, if viewed merely as processes of\r\n    our own present thinking, whose objects are external to\r\n    themselves, involve in all their more complex forms, combinations\r\n    of ideas, devices whereby we weave already present ideas into more\r\n    manifold structure, thereby enriching our internal meaning; but\r\n    the act of judgment has always its other, its objective aspect.\r\n    The ideas when we judge are also to possess external meaning....\r\n    It is true, as Mr. Bradley has well said, that the intended\r\n    subject of every judgment is reality itself. The ideas that we\r\n    combine when we judge about external meanings are to have value\r\n    for us as truth only in so far as they not only possess internal\r\n    meaning, but also imitate, by their structure, what is at once\r\n    other than themselves, and, in significance, something above\r\n    themselves. That, at least, is the natural view of our\r\n    consciousness, just in so far as, in judging, we conceive our\r\n    thought as essentially other than its external object, and as\r\n    destined merely to correspond thereto. Now we have by this time\r\n    come to feel how hard it is to define the Reality to which our\r\n    ideas are thus to conform, and about which our judgments are said\r\n    to be made, so long as we thus sunder external and internal\r\n    meanings.[180]\r\n\r\n_The universal judgment._--The problem is, then, to discover just the\r\nnature and ground of this relation between the internal and external\r\nmeaning, between the idea and its object. This relation is established\r\nin the act of judgment. Taking first _the universal judgment_, we find\r\nhere that the internal meaning has at best only a negative relation to\r\nthe external meaning.\r\n\r\n    To say that all A is B is in fact merely to assert that the real\r\n    world contains no objects that are A, but that fail to be of the\r\n    class B. To say that no A is B is to assert that the real world\r\n    contains no objects that are at once A and B.[181]\r\n\r\nThe universal judgments then \"tell us indirectly what is in the realm of\r\nexternal meaning; but only by first telling us what is not.\"[182]\r\n\r\nHowever, these universal judgments have after all a positive value in\r\nthe realm of internal meaning; that is, as mere thought.\r\n\r\n    This negative character of the universal judgments holds true of\r\n    them, as we have just said, just in so far as you sunder the\r\n    external and internal meaning, and just in so far as you view the\r\n    real as the beyond, and as the merely beyond. If you turn your\r\n    attention once more to the realm of ideas, viewed as internal\r\n    meaning, you see, indeed, that they are constantly becoming\r\n    enriched in their inner life by all this process. To know by inner\r\n    demonstration that 2+2=4 and that this is necessarily so, is not\r\n    yet to know that the external world, taken merely as the Beyond,\r\n    contains any true or finally valid variety of objects at all, any\r\n    two or four objects that can be counted.... On the other hand, so\r\n    far as your internal meaning goes, to have experienced within that\r\n    which makes you call this judgment necessary, is indeed to have\r\n    observed a character about your own ideas which rightly seems to\r\n    you very positive.[183]\r\n\r\nThis passage deserves especial attention. In the light of Kant, and in\r\nview of Mr. Royce's general definition of the judgment as the reference\r\nof internal to external meanings, one is puzzled to find that for the\r\nmathematician the positive value of the judgment \"two and two are four\"\r\nis confined to the realm of internal meaning. To be sure, Mr. Royce says\r\nthat this limitation of the positive value of the universal judgment to\r\nthe world of internal meaning occurs only when the external and internal\r\nmeaning are sundered. But the point is: Does the mathematician or anyone\r\nelse ever so sunder as to regard the judgment \"two and two are four\" as\r\nof positive value only as internal meaning? Indeed, in another\r\nconnection Mr. Royce himself shows most clearly that mathematical\r\nresults are as objective and as empirical as the astronomer's star.[184]\r\nNor would it appear competent for anyone to say here: \"Of course, they\r\nare not internal meanings _after_ we come to see, through the kind\r\noffices of the epistemologist, that the internal meanings are valid of\r\nthe external world.\" We are insisting that they are never taken by the\r\nmathematician and scientists at first as merely internal meaning whose\r\nexternal meaning is then to be established. Surely the mathematical\r\njudgment, or any other, does not require an epistemological midwife to\r\neffect the passage from internal to external meaning. The external\r\nmeaning is there all the while in the form of the diagrams and motor\r\ntensions and images with which the mathematician works. The difficulty\r\nhere again seems to be that the distinction above discussed between the\r\nidea in the logical sense, as purpose, and the immediate fulfilling\r\nexperience is lost sight of. The relation between two and four is not\r\nfirst discovered as a merely internal meaning. It is discovered in the\r\nprocess of fulfilling some purpose involving the working out of this\r\nrelation. So the sum of the angles of a triangle is not discovered as a\r\nmere internal meaning whose external meaning is then to be found. It is\r\nfound _in working with_ the triangle. It is discovered _in_ the\r\ntriangle. And, once more, it matters not if the triangle here is a mere\r\nmemory image. In relation to the purpose, to the logical idea, it is as\r\ntruly external and objective as pine sticks or chalk marks. The streams\r\nof motor, etc., images that flow spontaneously under the stimulus of the\r\npurpose are just as immediate fulfilling experiences as the manipulation\r\nof sticks or chalk lines.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in keeping the universal judgment, as a judgment, in\r\nterms of merely internal meaning may be seen from the following:\r\n\r\n    As to these two types of judgments, the universal and the\r\n    particular, they both, as we have seen, make use of experience.\r\n    The universal judgments arise in the realm where experience and\r\n    idea have already fused into one whole; and this is precisely the\r\n    realm of internal meanings. Here one constructs and observes the\r\n    consequences of one's construction. But the construction is at\r\n    once an experience _of fact and an idea_.... Upon the basis of\r\n    such ideal constructions one makes universal judgments. These in a\r\n    fashion still to us, at this stage, mysterious, undertake to be\r\n    valid of that other world--the world of external meaning.[185]\r\n\r\nOne is somewhat puzzled to know just what is meant by the fusion \"of\r\nexperience and idea.\" We must infer that it means the fusion of some\r\naspect of experience which can be set over against idea, and this has\r\nalways meant the external meaning, and this interpretation seems\r\nfurther warranted by the statement immediately following which describes\r\nthe fusion as one \"of _fact_ and idea.\" The situation then seems to be\r\nthis: An internal and an external meaning, a fact and an idea, \"fuse\r\ninto one whole\" and thus constitute that which is yet \"precisely the\r\nrealm of internal meanings,\" which aims to be valid of still another\r\nworld of external meanings. And this waives the question of how\r\nexperience fused into one whole can be an internal meaning, since as\r\nsuch it must be in opposition and reference to an external meaning; or\r\nconversely, how experience can be at once fact _and_ idea and still be\r\n\"fused into one whole.\"\r\n\r\nNor does the difficulty disappear when we turn to the aspects of\r\nuniversality and necessity. What is the significance and basis of\r\nuniversality and necessity as confined merely to the realm of internal\r\nmeaning?\r\n\r\n    So far as your internal meaning goes, _to have experienced within\r\n    that which makes you call this judgment necessary_ is, indeed, to\r\n    have observed a character about your own ideas which rightly seems\r\n    to you very positive.[186]\r\n\r\nBut what is it that we \"experience within\" which makes us call this\r\njudgment necessary? In the discussion of the relation of the universal\r\njudgment to the disjunctive judgment, through which the former is shown\r\nto get even its negative force, there is an interesting statement:\r\n\r\n    One who inquires into a matter upon which he believes himself able\r\n    to decide in universal terms, _e. g._, in mathematics, has present\r\n    to his mind, at the outset, questions such as admit of alternative\r\n    answers. \"A,\" he declares, \"in case it exists at all, is either B\r\n    or C.\" Further research shows universally, perhaps, that No A is\r\n    B.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence is the statement referred to. What is meant by\r\n\"further research shows universally, perhaps, that No A is B\"? What kind\r\nof \"research,\" internal or external, can show this? In short, there\r\nappears to be as much difficulty with universality and necessity in the\r\nrealm of internal meaning as in the reference of internal to external\r\nmeaning.[187]\r\n\r\nInstead, however, of discussing this point, Mr. Royce pursues the\r\nproblem of the relation of the external and internal meaning, and finds\r\nthat regarded as sundered there is no basis so far for even the negative\r\nuniversality and necessity in the reference of the internal meaning to\r\nthe external.\r\n\r\n    For at this point arises the ancient question, How can you know at\r\n    all that your judgment is universally valid, even in this ideal\r\n    and negative way, about that external realm of validity, in so far\r\n    as it is external, and is merely your Other,--the Beyond? Must you\r\n    not just dogmatically say that that world must agree with your\r\n    negations? This judgment is indeed positive. But how do you prove\r\n    it? The only answer has to be in terms which already suggest how\r\n    vain is the very sundering in question. If you can predetermine,\r\n    even if but thus negatively, what cannot exist in the object, the\r\n    object then cannot be merely foreign to you. It must be somewhat\r\n    predetermined by your Meaning.[188]\r\n\r\nBut in the universal judgment this determination, as referred to the\r\nexternal meaning, is only negative.\r\n\r\n_The particular judgment._--It is then through the particular judgment\r\nthat the universal judgment is to get any positive value in its\r\nreference to the external meaning.\r\n\r\n    As has been repeatedly pointed out in the discussions on recent\r\n    Logic, the particular judgments--whose form is Some A is B, or\r\n    Some A is not B--are the typical judgments that positively assert\r\n    Being in the object viewed as external. This fact constitutes\r\n    their essential contrast with the universal judgments. They\r\n    undertake to cross the chasm that is said to sunder internal and\r\n    external meanings; and the means by which they do so is always\r\n    what is called \"external experience.\"\r\n\r\nIt is now high time to ask why the internal meaning seeks this external\r\nmeaning. Why does it seek an object? Why does it want to cross the\r\nchasm? In other words, what is the significance of the demand for the\r\nparticular judgment? In the introduction we have been told, as a matter\r\nof description, that the internal meanings do seek the external meaning,\r\nbut why do they? We have also been told that universal judgments\r\n\"develop and enrich the realm of internal meaning.\" Why, then, should\r\nthere be a demand for the external meaning, for a further object? The\r\nanswer is:\r\n\r\n    We have our internal meanings. We develop them in inner\r\n    experience. There they get presented as something of universal\r\n    value, _but always in fragments_. They, therefore, so far\r\n    dissatisfy. We conceive of the Other wherein these meanings shall\r\n    get some sort of final fulfilment.[189]\r\n\r\nIt is, then, the incomplete and fragmentary character of the internal\r\nmeaning that demands the particular judgment. The particular judgment is\r\nto further complete and determine the incomplete and indeterminate\r\ninternal meaning. And yet no sooner is this particular judgment made\r\nthan we are told that \"it is a form at once positive, and very\r\nunsatisfactorily indeterminate.\" Again:[190]\r\n\r\n    The judgments of experience, the particular judgments, express a\r\n    positive but still imperfect determination of internal meaning\r\n    through external experience. The limit or goal of this process\r\n    would be an individual judgment wherein the will expressed its own\r\n    final determination.[191]\r\n\r\nApparently, then, the particular judgment to which the internal meaning\r\nappeals for completion and determination only succeeds in increasing the\r\nfragmentary and indeterminate character.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to another \"previous question.\" Just what are we to\r\nunderstand by this \"fragmentary\" and \"indeterminate\" character of the\r\ninternal meaning? In what sense, with reference to what, is it\r\nincomplete and fragmentary? Later we shall be told that it is with\r\nreference to \"its own final and completely individual expression.\" This\r\nis to be reached in the individual judgment. And if we ask what is meant\r\nby this final, complete, and individual expression--which, by the way,\r\nno human being can experience--we read, wondering all the while how it\r\ncan be known, that it is simply \"the expression that seeks no other,\"\r\nthat \"is satisfied,\" that \"is conclusive of the search for\r\nperfection.\"[192] Waiving for the present questions concerning the basis\r\nof this satisfaction and perfection, all this leaves unanswered our\r\nquery concerning the other end of the matter, viz., the meaning and\r\ncriterion of the fragmentary and indeterminate character of these\r\ninternal meanings.\r\n\r\nIf we here return to the first definition of internal meaning of the\r\nidea as a purpose in the sense of \"a plan of action,\" such as \"singing\r\nin tune,\" or getting the properties of a geometrical figure, it does not\r\nseem difficult to find a basis and meaning for this fragmentary and\r\nindeterminate character. First we may note in a general way that it is\r\nof the very essence of a plan or purpose to lead on to a fulfilling\r\nexperience such as singing in tune, or reaching a mathematical equation.\r\nBut here this fulfilling experience to which the plan points is not a\r\nmere working out of detail inside the plan itself, although, indeed,\r\nthis does take place. If this were all the fulfilling experience meant,\r\nit is difficult to see how we should escape subjective idealism.[193] We\r\nstart with a relatively indeterminate idea and end with a more\r\ndeterminate _idea_, though, indeed, there is yet no criterion for this\r\nincreased determination. To be sure, the idea as a plan of action, as\r\nhas already been stated, does undergo change and does become, if you\r\nplease, more definite and complete as a plan; but this does not\r\nconstitute its fulfilment. Its fulfilment surely is to be found in the\r\nimmediate experiences of singing, etc., to which the idea points and\r\nleads.\r\n\r\nThe fragmentary and incomplete character of the internal meaning as a\r\nplan of action does not, then, after all, so much describe the plan\r\nitself as it does the general condition of experience out of which the\r\nidea arises. Experience takes on the form of a plan, of an idea,\r\nprecisely because it has fallen apart, has become \"fragmentary.\" It is\r\njust the business of the internal meaning, as Mr. Royce so well shows,\r\nto form a plan, an ideal, an hypothetical synthesis that shall stimulate\r\nan activity, which shall satisfactorily heal the breach. \"Fragmentary\"\r\nis a quality, then, that belongs, not to the idea in itself considered,\r\nbut to the general condition of experience, of which the idea as a plan\r\nis an expression.\r\n\r\nIf, now, the fragmentary character of the internal meaning is determined\r\nsimply with relation to the fulfilling experiences, such as singing in\r\ntune, adjustments of geometrical figures, etc., to which it points and\r\nleads, it seems as if the completion of the internal meaning must be\r\ndefined in the same terms. And this would appear to open a pretty\r\nstraight path to the redefinition of truth and error.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE CRITERION OF TRUTH AND ERROR\r\n\r\nAt the outset, truth was defined as the \"correspondence\" or \"agreement\"\r\nof an idea with its object. But we have seen that correspondence or\r\nagreement with an object means the completion and determination of the\r\nidea itself, and since the idea is here a specific \"plan of action,\" it\r\nwould seem that the \"true\" idea would be the one that can complete\r\nitself by stimulating a satisfying activity. The false idea would be\r\none that cannot complete itself in a satisfying activity, such as\r\nsinging in tune, constructing a mathematical equation, etc., and just\r\nthis solution is very clearly expounded by our author. In the case of\r\nmathematical inquiry,\r\n\r\n    In just so far as we _pause satisfied_ we observe that there \"is\r\n    no other\" mathematical fact to be sought _in the direction of the\r\n    particular inquiry in hand_. Satisfaction of purpose by means of\r\n    _presented fact_ and such determinate satisfaction as sends us to\r\n    no other experience for further light and fulfillment, precisely\r\n    this outcome is itself the Other that is sought when we begin our\r\n    inquiry.[194]\r\n\r\nSo \"when other facts of experience are sought,\" if I watch for stars or\r\nfor a chemical precipitate, or for a turn in the stock market, or in the\r\nsickness of a friend, my ideas are true when they are satisfied with\r\n\"the presented facts.\" Again,\r\n\r\n    It follows that the finally determinate form of the object of any\r\n    finite idea is that form which the idea itself would assume\r\n    whenever it became individuated, or in other words, became a\r\n    completely determined idea, an idea or will fulfilled by a wholly\r\n    adequate empirical content, for which no other content need be\r\n    substituted or from the point of view of the satisfied idea, could\r\n    be substituted.[195]\r\n\r\nIn such passages as these it seems clear that the test of the truth of\r\nan idea is its power to bring us to the point where we \"pause\r\nsatisfied,\" where \"no other content need be substituted,\" etc. Nor in\r\nsuch passages does there seem to be any doubt of reaching satisfaction\r\nin particular cases. Here, it appears, we _may_ sing in tune, we _may_\r\nget the desired precipitate, and possibly even interpret the stock\r\nmarket correctly. Of course, the discord, the hunger, the loss, will\r\ncome again; but so will new ideas, new truths. \"Man thinks in order to\r\nget control of his world and thereby of himself.\"[196] Then the control\r\nactually gained must measure the value, the truth of his thought. Do you\r\nwish to sing in tune, \"then your musical ideas are false if they lead\r\nyou to strike what are then called false notes.\"[197]\r\n\r\nIt should also be noticed that here this desired determination does not\r\nconsist in a further determination of the mere idea as such. It is found\r\nin \"the presented fact,\" in the immediate activity of singing, of\r\ngetting precipitates, etc. As has already been pointed out, it is only\r\nby using the term \"idea\" for both the purpose and the fulfilling act of\r\nsinging that this \"pause of satisfaction\" can be ascribed to the further\r\ndetermination of the idea. As such, as also before remarked, the sort of\r\ndetermination that the idea here gets means its termination, its\r\ndisappearance in the immediate experiences of singing, etc., to which it\r\nleads. The \"indefinite restlessness\" of hunger and cold would scarcely\r\nbe satisfied by getting more determinate and specific _ideas_ only of\r\nfood and shelter. The satisfaction comes when the ideas are \"realized,\"\r\nwhen the \"plans\" are swallowed up in fulfilment.\r\n\r\nBut in all this nothing has been said about \"the certain absolute system\r\nof ideas,\" nor does there appear to be here any demand for it. To be\r\nsure, in the passages just considered, experience has been found to\r\nbecome \"fragmentary,\" but it has also been found capable of healing, of\r\nwholing itself, not of course into any \"final whole,\" but into the unity\r\nof \"satisfaction\" as regards \"the particular inquiry in hand.\" There is\r\nof course failure as well, but this also is not final. It means simply\r\nthat we must look farther for the \"pause of satisfaction,\" that we must\r\nconstruct another idea, another \"plan of action.\"\r\n\r\nBut, after having shown that the idea as a plan of action may lead to\r\nsatisfaction in the particular case, and that its success or failure so\r\nto do is one measure of its truth or falsity, we are now suddenly\r\naroused to the fact that after all thought does not lead us to the\r\ncompleted \"absolute system of ideas,\" to a final stage of eternal\r\nunbroken satisfaction.\r\n\r\n    But never in our human process of experience do we reach that\r\n    determination. It is for us the object of love and of hope, of\r\n    desire and of will, of faith and of work, but never of present\r\n    finding.[198]\r\n\r\nIf at this point one asks: Whence this absolute system of ideas? Why\r\nhave we to reckon with it at all? there appears to be little that is\r\nsatisfying. Indeed, it seems difficult to get rid of the impression that\r\nthis \"certain absolute system of ideas\" is on our hands as a\r\nphilosophical heirloom from the time of Plato, so hallowed by time and\r\nso established by centuries of acceptance that we have ceased to ask for\r\nits credentials. To ground it in the \"essentially fragmentary character\r\nof human experience\" appears to be a _petitio_, for experience does not\r\nappear \"essentially fragmentary\" in this sense until after the absolute\r\nsystem has been posited.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings to notice that at this point both the fragmentary and\r\nunitary characters of experience take on new meaning. So far this\r\nfragmentary character has been defined with reference to \"the particular\r\ninquiry in hand.\" Now, since the distinction between absolute and human\r\nexperience has emerged, the fragmentary character becomes an absolute\r\nquality of the latter in contrast with the former. So, _mutatis\r\nmutandis_, of unity. Up to this point unity, wholeness, has been\r\npossible within human experience in the case of particular problems,\r\nsuch as singing in tune, etc. But with the appearance of the absolute\r\nsystem of ideas, wholeness is now the exclusive quality of the latter,\r\nas incompleteness is of human experience, though of course the _working_\r\nunity, the unity resulting in \"pauses of satisfaction,\" must still\r\nremain in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe problem now is to somehow work the absolute system of ideas into\r\nconnection with the conception of the idea as a purpose, as a concrete\r\nplan of action. Here is where the third conception of the relation\r\nbetween idea and purpose, described at the beginning, comes into\r\nplay--the conception in which the idea, instead of being the purpose, or\r\nthe fulfilment of a purpose, _has_ the purpose to correspond with, or\r\nrepresent \"its own final and completely individual expression,\"\r\ncontained in the absolute system. From the previous standpoint the\r\nidea's \"own final and completely individual expression\" has been found\r\nin the fulfilling experiences of singing in tune, getting mathematical\r\nequations, chemical precipitates, etc. Here this complete individual\r\nexperience can never be found in finite, human experience, but must be\r\nsought in the absolute system--and this can be only \"the object of love\r\nand hope, of desire and will, never of present finding.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many previous protestations that the purposive\r\nfunction of the idea is its \"primary\" and \"most essential\" character, we\r\nare here forced to fall back upon correspondence--representation as the\r\nprimary, the essential, and indeed, it appears at times, as the sole\r\nfunction. For in the attempt to bring these two functions together the\r\npurposive function is swallowed up in the representative. The idea still\r\nis, or has a purpose, a \"plan of action,\" but this purpose, this plan,\r\nis now nothing but to represent and correspond with its own final and\r\ncompleted form in the absolute system. By this simple _coup_ is the\r\npurposive function of the idea reduced at once to the representative.\r\nNor is it pertinent to urge at this point that every purpose involves\r\nrepresentation, that the plan must be some sort of an image or scheme\r\nwhich symbolizes and stimulates the thing to be done. This no one would\r\nquestion, but now the sole \"thing to be done\" apparently is to perfect\r\nthis representation of the complete and individual form in the absolute\r\nsystem.[199]\r\n\r\nOnce more, an array of passages could be marshaled from almost every\r\npage refuting any such interpretation as this, but they would be\r\npassages expounding the part played by the idea in such concrete\r\nexperiences as singing, measuring, etc., not in representing an absolute\r\nsystem of ideas. Even as regards the latter one might urge that, by\r\ninsisting on the active character of the idea, we could after all regard\r\nthis absolute system as a life of will after the fashion of our own,\r\nwere it not at once described as \"the complete embodiment,\" \"the final\r\nfulfilment,\" of finite ideas. A life consisting of mere fulfilment seems\r\na baffling paradox. And its timeless character only adds to the\r\ndifficulty. Moreover, if we regard the system as constituted by such\r\nconcrete activities as measuring and singing, etc., while we have saved\r\nwill, we shall now have to fallback upon our first conception of truth\r\nas found in the idea which unifies the fragmentary condition of\r\nexperience as related to specific problems, not fragmentary as related\r\nto an absolute system.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the final and crucial point of the discussion, the\r\npart which purpose plays in the determination of _truth_ and _error_\r\nfrom the standpoint of \"the absolute system of ideas.\" When is this\r\npurpose of the idea to correspond with its absolute, final, and\r\ncompleted form fulfilled, or partially fulfilled? And here at the very\r\noutset is a difficulty. We have read repeatedly that the idea is itself\r\n\"the partial fulfilment of a purpose.\" It is now to seek an object which\r\nshall increase this degree of fulfilment, but still this fulfilment\r\nshall be incomplete. And when we come to consider error, it too will be\r\nfound to consist in a partial fulfilment. So it appears that there are\r\nthree stages of \"partial fulfilment\" to be discriminated, one belonging\r\nto the idea itself, another to finite truth, and still another to error.\r\n\r\nReturning to the problem, from this point on we find the two\r\nstandpoints, that of the specific situation and that of the absolute\r\nsystem, so closely interwoven and entangled that they are followed with\r\ngreat difficulty. We have already seen that the idea seeks\r\ncorrespondence with its object, because it is \"fragmentary,\"\r\n\"incomplete,\" \"indetermined.\" And there we found that this indeterminate\r\nand fragmentary character belonged to the idea as a purpose, a plan of\r\nseeking relief from some sort of \"restlessness\" and \"dissatisfaction,\"\r\nsuch as singing out of tune, etc. Here it is the incompleteness of an\r\nimperfect representation of its object in the absolute system that is\r\nthe _motif_, and how it is to effect an improvement in its imperfect\r\ncondition is now the problem. Here again the appeal is to purpose.\r\nWhatever may constitute the absolute system, one thing is assured:\r\nnothing in it can be an object except as the finite idea \"intends it,\"\r\npurposes it, to be its object. Again must we ask: On what basis is this\r\nobject in the absolute system selected at all? In general the answer is:\r\nOn the basis of a need of \"further determination;\" but when we further\r\nanalyze this, we find it means on the basis of a specific want or need,\r\nsuch as food, shelter, measuring, singing, etc. The basis of the\r\nselection, then, is entirely on the side of the concrete, finite\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nHere, too, we might ask: Whence the confidence that there will be found\r\nsomething in the absolute system that will fulfil the purpose generated\r\non the side of the finite? Must we not here fall back on something like\r\na pre-established harmony? To this our author would say: \"Yea, verily.\r\nThe fact that the absolute system responds to the finite needs does\r\nprecisely show that the finite and the absolute cannot be sundered.\" But\r\nwhen we try to state _how_ the purpose generated on the side of the\r\nfinite can be met by the absolute system, the account again seems to run\r\nso much in terms of the finite experience that to call it a system of\r\n\"final,\" \"completed,\" and \"fulfilled\" ideas does not seem accurate. We\r\nmust note here, too, the shifting in the sense of \"purpose.\" The idea\r\nselects its object on the basis of the material needed to relieve the\r\nunrest and dissatisfaction of singing out of tune, etc. But now it is to\r\nbe satisfied by increasing the extent of its representation of its\r\nobject in the absolute system.\r\n\r\nAnd now, finally, what shall mark the attainment of this purpose of the\r\nidea to correspond and represent \"its own completed form\"? When is the\r\ncorrespondence and representation true? Simply at the point where \"we\r\npause satisfied,\" where \"no other content need be substituted, or from\r\nthe point of view of the satisfied idea could be substituted.\" That is\r\nall; there is no other answer. There are other statements, but they all\r\ncome to the same thing. For instance:\r\n\r\n    It is true--this instant's idea--if, in its own measure, and on\r\n    its own plan, it corresponds, even in its vagueness, to its own\r\n    final and completely individual expression.[200]\r\n\r\nBut the moment we ask what this \"final and individual expression\" is,\r\nand what is meant by \"in its own measure,\" and \"on its own plan,\" we\r\nare thrown back at once upon the preceding statement. The next sentence\r\nfollowing the passage just quoted does indeed define this \"individual\r\nexpression.\" \"Its expression would be the very life of fulfilment of\r\npurpose which this present idea already fragmentarily begins, as it\r\nwere, to express.\" But how can we know that the expression is\r\n\"fragmentary\" unless we have some experience of wholeness?\r\n\r\nAnd here perhaps is the place to say, what has been implied all along,\r\nthat this absolutely \"fragmentary\" character of human experience is an\r\nabstraction of the relatively disintegrated condition into which\r\nexperience temporarily falls, which abstraction is then reinstated as a\r\nfixed quality, overlooking the fact that experience becomes fragmentary\r\nonly that it may again become whole. The absolute system, the final\r\nfulfilment, is in the same case. It too is but the hypostatized\r\nabstraction of the function of becoming whole, of wholing and\r\nfulfilling, which manifests itself in the \"pauses of satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" Mr. Royce would say, \"the wholeness of the particular instance is\r\nafter all not a true and perfect wholeness, because we can always think\r\nof the fulfilling experience as possibly different, as having a possibly\r\ndifferent embodiment.\" But this implies also a different purpose.\r\nMoreover, it abstracts the purpose from the specific conditions under\r\nwhich the purpose develops. Thus in singing in tune one doubtless could\r\neasily imagine himself singing another tune, on another occasion, in\r\nanother key, in a clear tenor instead of a cracked bass, etc. But if on\r\n_this_ occasion, in _this_ song, and with _this_ cracked bass voice one,\r\naccepting all these conditions, does, with malice aforethought, purpose\r\nto strike the tune, and happily succeeds, why, for that purpose formed\r\nunder the known and accepted conditions, is not the accomplishment final\r\nand absolute? Nor is the case any different, so far as I can see, in\r\nmathematical experience. To quote again:\r\n\r\n    You think of numbers, and accordingly count one, two, three. Your\r\n    idea of these numbers is abstract, a mere generality. Why? Because\r\n    there could be other cases of counting, and other numbers counted\r\n    than the present counting process shows you, and why so? Because\r\n    your purpose in counting is not wholly fulfilled by the numbers\r\n    now counted.[201]\r\n\r\nI confess I cannot see here in what respect the purpose is not\r\nfulfilled. Doubtless there could be \"other cases of counting,\" and\r\n\"other numbers,\" but these may not be included in my present purpose,\r\nwhich is simply to count here and now. In this passage the purpose is\r\nnot very fully defined. One's counting is usually for something, if for\r\nnothing more than merely to illustrate the process. In this latter case\r\none's purpose would be completely fulfilled by just the numbers used\r\nwhen he should \"pause satisfied\" with the illustration. Or, if I wish to\r\nshow the properties of numbers, then the discovery that there can always\r\nbe more of them fulfils my purpose, since this endless progression is\r\none of the properties. Or yet again, if one should suddenly become\r\nenamored of the process of counting, and forthwith should purpose to\r\ndevote the rest of his days to it, it would still be fortunate that\r\nthere were always other numbers to be counted. In other words, the idea\r\nas a purpose is formed with reference to, and out of, specific\r\nconditions. In the last analysis the problem always is: What is to be\r\ndone here and now with the actual material at hand, under the present\r\nconditions? As the purpose is determined by these specific conditions,\r\nso is the fulfilment. To say that the fulfilment might be different is\r\nvirtually to say that the purpose might have been different, or indeed\r\nthat the universe might have been different.\r\n\r\nThis necessity of falling back upon the character of the idea as a\r\npurpose in the sense of the specific \"plan of action\" comes into still\r\nbolder relief in the consideration of error from the standpoint of \"the\r\nabsolute system of ideas.\" As already mentioned, the initial and\r\npersistent problem here is to distinguish at all between truth and error\r\nin our experience from this standpoint. All our efforts at representing\r\nthe absolute system must fall short. What can we mean, then, by calling\r\nsome of our ideas true and others false? The definition of error is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    An error is an error about a specific object, only in case the\r\n    purpose, imperfectly defined by the vague idea at the instant when\r\n    the error is made, is better defined, is in fact, better fulfilled\r\n    by an object whose determinate character in some wise, although\r\n    never absolutely, opposes the fragmentary efforts first made to\r\n    define them.[202]\r\n\r\nBut in relation to the absolute system the later part of this statement\r\nholds of all our ideas. There always is the absolute object which would\r\n\"better define\" and \"better fulfil\" our purposes. Hence it is only in\r\nreference to the \"specific\" instances of singing, measuring, etc., that\r\na basis for the distinction can be found. Here our plan is not true so\r\nlong as its mission of relieving the specific unrest and\r\ndissatisfaction, the specific discord or hunger, is unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe only criterion, then, which we have been able to find for the\r\nfulfilment of the purpose, for the truth of the idea as representing an\r\nobject in the absolute system, is the sense of wholeness, the \"pause of\r\nsatisfaction,\" which we experience in realizing such specific purposes\r\nas \"singing in tune.\" And if it be said again: \"Precisely so; this only\r\nshows how intimate is the relation between our experience and the\r\nabsolute system of ideas;\" then must it also be said once more, either\r\nthat the absolute system can be nothing more than an abstraction of the\r\nelement of wholeness or wholing in our experience, or that thus far the\r\nrelation appears to rest upon sheer assumption.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be insisted, as suggested at the outset of this\r\ndiscussion, that the idea can well have two purposes: one to help\r\nconstitute and solve the specific problems of daily life; the other to\r\nrepresent the absolute system. Very well, we must then make out a case\r\nfor the latter. If the purposes are to be different, the purpose to\r\nrepresent the Absolute should have a criterion of its own. This we have\r\nnot been able to find. On the contrary, whenever pushed to the point of\r\nstating a criterion for the representation of the absolute system, we\r\nhave had to appeal, in every case, to the fulfilment of a specific\r\nfinite purpose. And even if this purpose to represent the absolute\r\nsystem had some apparent standard of its own, we should not be content\r\nto leave the matter so. We should scarcely be satisfied to observe as a\r\nmere matter of fact that the idea has a reconstructive function, and\r\n_also_ a representative function. Such a brute dualism would be\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nIn the end, the outcome of the endeavor to establish a connection\r\nbetween the relation of the idea to human experience and its relation to\r\nthe absolute system does not appear satisfying. The idea is left either\r\nwith two independent purposes--one to reconstruct finite experience, the\r\nother to represent and symbolize the absolute system--or one of these\r\npurposes is merged in the other. When the attempt is made from the\r\nstandpoint of the absolute system, the reconstructive purpose is\r\nswallowed up in the representative. When, on the other hand, the need\r\nfor a basis of distinction between truth and error \"here on this bank\r\nand shoal of time\" is felt, the representative disappears in the\r\nreconstructive function. Nowhere are we able to discover a true\r\nunification. To be sure, we have been told again and again that the\r\nrepresentation of the absolute object, if only we could accomplish it,\r\nwould be \"the final fulfilment,\" \"completion,\" and \"realization\" of the\r\nhuman, finite purpose. But besides a confessed impotency at the very\r\nstart, this involves, as we have seen, either a sudden transformation of\r\nthe specific purpose of singing in tune, etc., into that of representing\r\nthe absolute system, or a sheer assumption that the representation of\r\nthe absolute object does somehow help in the realization of the specific\r\nfinite purpose. Nowhere is there any account of _how_ this help would be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nAnd this suggests that if the analysis of the idea as purpose, given at\r\nthe outset of Mr. Royce's lecture, had been developed further, if the\r\nconditions and origin of purpose had been examined, it is difficult to\r\nsee how this discrepancy could have escaped disclosure. Mr. Royce starts\r\nhis account by simply accepting from psychology a general description of\r\nthe purposive character of the idea. Even in the more detailed passages\r\non purpose we have nothing but descriptions of purpose after it is\r\nformed. Nothing is said of the origin of this purposiveness. The\r\npurposive character of experience is of course very manifest, but what\r\nis the significance of this purposing in experience as a whole? What is\r\nthe source and the material of the purposes?\r\n\r\nIt is this uncritical acceptance of the purposive quality of the idea\r\nthat obscures the irrelevancy of its relation to the absolute system. If\r\nthe idea must merely be or have a purpose, then it may as well be that\r\nof representing the absolute system as any other. Of course, there are\r\ntroublesome questions as to how our finite ideas ever got such a\r\npurpose; but, after all, if it is simply a matter of having any sort of\r\na purpose, representing the absolute system may answer as well as\r\nanything. But when now we come to deal with the problem of fulfilment,\r\nwith the question of truth and error, we have to reckon with this\r\nneglect of the source of this purposiveness.\r\n\r\nIt is this unanalyzed ground of the purpose that makes the matter of\r\nfulfilment so ambiguous. Such an analysis, we believe, would have shown\r\nthat the conditions out of which the idea as a purpose arises determine\r\nalso the sort of fulfilment possible. There are, indeed, one or two very\r\ngeneral, but very significant, statements in this direction, if they\r\nwere only followed up. For instance:\r\n\r\n    In doing what we often call \"making up our minds\" we pass from a\r\n    vague to a definite state of will and of resolution. In such cases\r\n    we begin with perhaps a very indefinite sort of restlessness which\r\n    arouses the question: \"What is it that I want, what do I desire,\r\n    what is my real purpose?\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, what does this restlessness mean? What is the matter?\r\nWhat is to be done?\r\n\r\nPurpose is born, then, out of restlessness and dissatisfaction. But\r\nwhence comes this restlessness and dissatisfaction? Surely we cannot at\r\nthis point charge it to a discrepancy between our finite idea and the\r\nabsolute object, since it is just this restlessness that is giving birth\r\nto the purposive idea. One thing, at any rate, appears pretty certain:\r\nthis \"indefinite restlessness\" presupposes some sort of activity already\r\ngoing on. The restlessness is not generated in a vacuum. But why should\r\nthis activity get into a condition to be described as \"indefinite\r\nrestlessness\" and dissatisfaction?\r\n\r\nRepugnant as it will be to many to have psycho-physical, to say nothing\r\nof biological, doctrines introduced into a logical discussion, I confess\r\nthat, at this point facing the issue squarely, I see no other way. And\r\nit appears to me that just at this point it is the fear of\r\nphenomenalistic giants that has kept logic wandering so many years in\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, in this action already going on is responsible for this\r\nrestlessness? First let us note that \"indefinite restlessness\" and\r\n\"dissatisfaction\" are terms descriptive of what Mr. James calls \"the\r\nfirst thing in the way of consciousness.\" This assumes consciousness as\r\na factor in activity. So that our question now becomes: What is the\r\nsignificance of this factor of restless, dissatisfied consciousness in\r\nactivity? Now, there appears no way of getting at the part which\r\nconsciousness plays different from that of discovering the function of\r\nanything else. And this way is simply that of observing, as best we may,\r\nthe conditions under which consciousness operates, and what it does.\r\nHere the biologist and psychologist with one voice inform us that this\r\nindefinite restlessness which marks the point of the operation of\r\nconsciousness arises where, in a co-ordinated system of activities,\r\nthere develop out of the continuation of the activity itself new\r\nconditions calling for a readjustment and reconstruction of the\r\nactivity, if it is to go on. Consciousness then appears to be the\r\nfunction which makes possible the reorganization of the results of a\r\nprocess back into the process itself, thus constituting and preserving\r\nthe continuity of activity. So interpreted, consciousness appears to be\r\nan essential element in the conception of a self-sustaining activity.\r\nThis \"indefinite restlessness,\" in which consciousness begins, marks,\r\nthen, the operation of the function of reconstruction without which\r\nactivity would utterly break down.\r\n\r\nPrecisely because, then, the idea \"as a plan\" is projected and\r\nconstructed in response to this restlessness must its fulfilment be\r\nrelevant to it. It is when the idea as a purpose, a plan, born out of\r\nthis matrix of restlessness, begins to aspire to the absolute system,\r\nand attempts to ignore or repudiate its lowly antecedents, that the\r\ndifficulties concerning fulfilment begin. They are the difficulties that\r\nbeset every ambition which aspires to things foreign to its inherited\r\npowers and equipment.\r\n\r\nA detailed account at this point of the construction and fulfilment of\r\nthe idea as \"a plan of action\" would contain a consecutive\r\nreinterpretation of Mr. Royce's principal rubrics. Such an account the\r\nlimits of this paper forbid. We shall have to be content with pointing\r\nout in a general way a few instances by way of illustration.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is in this matrix of indefinite restlessness out\r\nof which the idea is born that the \"fragmentary character of\r\nexperience,\" of which Mr. Royce is so keenly conscious, appears. But,\r\nonce more, this fragmentary character is discernible only by contrast\r\nwith the wholeness on both sides of the fragments; the wholeness that\r\nprecedes the restlessness, and the new \"pause of satisfaction\" toward\r\nwhich it points. Nor must we forget that the habit matrix, out of the\r\ndisintegration of which the restlessness is immediately born, does not\r\nexist as some metaphysical ultimate out of which thought as such has\r\nevolved. Back of it is some previous purpose in whose service habit was\r\nenlisted. On the other hand, this disintegration means that the old\r\npurpose, the old plan, must be reconstructed; that it, along with the\r\ndisintegrated habit, becomes the material for a new plan, a new wholing\r\nof experience.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the construction of this new plan of action does\r\ninvolve \"re-presentation.\" The first step in the transition from the\r\ncondition of \"indefinite restlessness\" toward a \"plan\" is the diagnosis,\r\nthe definition of the restlessness. This involves the re-presentation in\r\nconsciousness of the activities, out of which the restlessness has\r\narisen. This re-presentation is also the beginning of the\r\nreconstruction. The diagnosis of the singing activity as being \"out of\r\ntune\" is the negative side of beginning to sing in tune. It is now a\r\ncommonplace of psychology that all representation is reconstruction. And\r\nthis is where Mr. Royce's emphasis of the symbolic, the algebraic, as\r\nagainst the copy type of representation, has its application. All we\r\nwant here is some sort of an image--visual, auditory, motor, it matters\r\nnot--that shall serve to focus attention upon the singing activities\r\nuntil they are reconstructed sufficiently to bring us to the \"pause of\r\nsatisfaction.\"[203] But nowhere in all this is there any reference to\r\nthe idea's object in the absolute system. Nor does there appear to be\r\nany call or place for such reference. The representation here is a part\r\nof the very process of forming the plan of further reconstruction out of\r\nthe materials of the specific situation. Representation is not the\r\nplan's own end and aim. This is to stimulate a new set of activities\r\nthat shall lead out of the present state of unrest and dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt is also true, as already mentioned, that in the process of fulfilling\r\nthe plan, of realizing the idea, further determination and specification\r\nis produced in the plan itself. The idea as a plan is certainly not\r\nformed all at once. Nor does it reach and maintain a fixed content. No\r\npurpose is ever realized in its original content. But this does not mean\r\nthat its realization is, therefore, \"partial,\" \"incomplete,\" or\r\n\"fragmentary.\" It is a part of its business to change. The purpose is\r\nnot there for its own sake. The purpose is there as a _means_ to the\r\nreorganization and reconstruction of experience. It exists, as Mr. Royce\r\nsays, as an instrument, \"as a tool\" for \"introducing control into\r\nexperience.\" And as, in the process of use, a tool always undergoes\r\nmodification, so here, as an instrument for reconstructing habit, the\r\nplan, too, undergoes reconstruction. Indeed, as regards its content, it\r\nis itself, as Mr. Royce says, as much a habit, as much \"the product of\r\nassociation,\" as any part of experience. The purposing function, the\r\npurposing activity, remains; its content is constantly shifting.\r\n\r\nHere, too, is where \"the submission of the idea to the object\" takes\r\nplace. Only, here, it is not a submission to an object already\r\nconstituted as it is in Mr. Royce's conception of the absolute system.\r\nThe idea as an hypothetical plan of action, as a trial construction,\r\nmust be tested by the activities it is attempting to reconstruct. That\r\nis to say, at this point the question is: Does the plan apply to the\r\nactivities actually involved in the unrest? Has it diagnosed the case\r\nproperly, and is it therefore one in and through which these activities\r\ncan operate and come to unity again? The \"submission\" here is the\r\nsubmission of the purpose, the end, to the material out of which it is\r\nformed, and with which it must work. But again this material to which\r\nthe idea submits itself is anything but finally fixed and \"complete\" in\r\nform. On the contrary, as we have seen, it is just the fragmentary and\r\nincomplete condition of this material that calls for the idea. Yet the\r\nidea as a plan must be true to its mission, and to this material, and in\r\nthis sense must submit itself to whatever modifications and\r\nreconstruction the material \"dictates\" as necessary in order that it may\r\nfunction in and through the plan.[204]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand--and this is the point to which Mr. Royce gives most\r\nemphasis--it is equally apparent that \"the idea must determine its\r\nobject.\" On this all philosophy, from Plato down, which approaches\r\nreality \"from the side of ideas\" is at stake. And this does not appear\r\nimpossible if, again, the object is not already and eternally fixed and\r\ncomplete. If the object is one constructed out of the very mass of habit\r\nmaterial which the idea is reconstructing, and if \"determination\" means\r\nnot copying, but construction, then, indeed, must the idea \"determine\r\nits object.\" Just for that does it have its being. That is its sole\r\nmission. Here the determination of the object by the idea is not a mere\r\nabstract postulate; it is not based upon a general consideration of the\r\ndisastrous consequences to our logical and ethical assumptions, if it\r\nwere not so determined. Here not only the general necessity for it, but\r\nthe _modus operandi_ of this determination, is apparent. But, at the\r\nrisk of tedious iteration, must it again be said that for the\r\ndetermination of the completed and perfected object in the absolute\r\nsystem not only is there nowhere any _modus_ to be found, but, even if\r\nthere were, it is difficult to see what it would have to do with the\r\nkind of determination demanded by such a specific sort of unrest as\r\n\"singing out of tune,\" etc. The process of submission is thus a\r\nreciprocal one. Neither in the object nor in the idea is there a fixed\r\nscheme or order _to_ which the other must submit and conform. And this\r\nis simply the logical commonplace that submission cannot be a one-sided\r\naffair, that determination must be reciprocal.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to what might as well have been our introductory as our\r\nconcluding observation. It has just been said that the determination of\r\nthe object by the idea is a vital matter in any philosophy which\r\napproaches reality \"from the side of ideas.\" Such a way of approach must\r\nassert \"the primacy of the world of ideas over the world as a\r\nfact.\"[205] Mr. Royce thus further states the case:\r\n\r\n    I am one of those who hold that when you ask what is an idea, and\r\n    how can ideas stand in any true relation to reality, you attack\r\n    the world knot in the way that promises most for the untying of\r\n    its meshes. This way is of course very ancient. It is the way of\r\n    Plato.... It is in a different sense the way of Kant. If you view\r\n    philosophy in this fashion, you subordinate the study of the world\r\n    as fact to a reflection upon the world as idea. Begin by accepting\r\n    upon faith and tradition the mere brute reality of the world as\r\n    fact, and there you are sunk deep in an ocean of mystery.... The\r\n    world of fact surprises you with all sorts of strange\r\n    contrasts.... It baffles you with caprices like a charming and yet\r\n    hopelessly wayward child, or like a bad fairy. The world of fact\r\n    daily announces itself to you as a defiant mystery.[206]\r\n\r\nHere we have concisely stated at the outset of the lectures the position\r\nwhich we have seen to be fraught with so many difficulties: the\r\nposition, namely, which accepts to start with the opposition of the\r\nworld as idea and the world as fact, as something given, instead of\r\nsomething to be accounted for; and which assumes that this opposition\r\nstands in the way of reaching reality, whereas it possibly may be of the\r\nvery essence of reality. To be sure, the above statement of this\r\nopposition between the world as fact and as idea is but the expository\r\nstarting-point. And it is true that the rest of the argument is occupied\r\nin the attempt to close this breach. But, as we have seen, except where\r\nthe idea is expounded as a specific purpose, arising out of a specific\r\nexperience of unrest, such as singing out of tune, etc.--except in this\r\ncase, the breach is taken as found and the attempt to heal it is made by\r\nworking forward from the opposition as given instead of back to its\r\nsource. This opposition, of course, has its forward goal, but the\r\ndifficulty is to find it without an exploration of its source. It is\r\nback in that matrix out of which the opposition has arisen that the line\r\nof direction to the goal is to be found.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in starting from this opposition of fact and idea as given,\r\nthe only method of quelling it seems to be either that of reducing one\r\nside to terms of the other, or of appealing to some new, and therefore\r\nexternal unifying, agency. But if the factors in the opposition are\r\nfound, not one in submission _to_ the other, nor having the \"primacy\"\r\n_over_ the other, but as co-ordinate and mutually determining functions,\r\ndeveloped from a common matrix and co-operating in the work of\r\nreconstructing experience, some of the difficulties involved in the\r\nalternative methods just mentioned appear to drop out.[207]\r\n\r\nThe point may be clearer if we recur to the passage and ask just what is\r\nmeant by \"the defiantly mysterious,\" \"baffling,\" and \"capricious\"\r\ncharacter of the world as fact--as \"brute reality.\" First, if by the\r\nworld as \"fact;\" as \"brute reality,\" we mean experience so brute that it\r\nis not yet \"lighted up with ideas,\" it is difficult to see how it could\r\nbe mysterious or capricious, since mystery and caprice appear only when\r\nexperience ceases to be taken merely as it comes and an inquiry for\r\nconnections and meanings has begun. That is to say, there can be neither\r\nmystery nor caprice except in relation to some sort of order. And order\r\nis always a matter of ideas. But it is sufficient to submit Mr. Royce's\r\nown statement on this point:\r\n\r\n    We all of us from moment to moment have experience. This\r\n    experience comes to us in part as brute fact; light and shade,\r\n    sound and silence, pain and grief and joy.... These given facts\r\n    flow by; and were they all, our world would be too much of a blind\r\n    problem for us even to be puzzled by its meaningless\r\n    presence.[208]\r\n\r\nIf next we take the world of fact as in contrast and co-ordinate with\r\nthe world of ideas, mystery and caprice here, certainly, are not all on\r\nthe side of the fact. Here, again, must they be functions of the\r\nrelation between fact and idea. We have seen that without thought there\r\nis neither mystery nor caprice. The idea then cannot take part in the\r\nproduction of mystery and caprice, and forthwith deny its parenthood. Of\r\ncourse, mystery and caprice are not the final fruits of this co-ordinate\r\nopposition of fact and idea. They are but the _first_ fruits--the\r\nrelatively unorganized embryonic mass which through the further\r\nactivities of the parent functions shall develop into the symmetry of\r\ntruth and law.\r\n\r\nThere appears then no ultimate \"primacy\" of either idea or fact over the\r\nother.

Doubtless the distinction of some experiences as belonging to me,\r\nas mine in a peculiarly intimate way, from others as chiefly concerning\r\nother persons, or as having to do with things, is an early one. But this\r\nis a distinction of _concern_, of value. The distinction referred to\r\nabove is that of making an _object_, or presentation, out of this felt\r\ntype of value, and thereby breaking it up into distinct \"events,\" etc.,\r\nwith their own laws of inner connection. This is the work of\r\npsychological analysis. Upon the whole matter of the psychical I am glad\r\nto refer to PROFESSOR GEORGE H. MEAD'S article entitled \"The Definition\r\nof the Psychical,\" Vol. III, Part II, of _The Decennial Publications of\r\nthe University of Chicago_.\r\n\r\n[13] We have a most acute and valuable criticism of Lotze from this\r\npoint of view in PROFESSOR HENRY JONES, _Philosophy of Lotze_, 1895. My\r\nspecific criticisms agree in the main with his, and I am glad to\r\nacknowledge my indebtedness. But I cannot agree in the belief that the\r\nbusiness of thought is to qualify reality as such; its occupation\r\nappears to me to be determining the reconstruction of some aspect or\r\nportion of reality, and to fall within the course of reality itself;\r\nbeing, indeed, the characteristic medium of its activity. And I cannot\r\nagree that reality as such, with increasing fulness of knowledge,\r\npresents itself as a thought-system, though, as just indicated, I have\r\nno doubt that reality appears as thought-specifications or values, just\r\nas it does as affectional and æsthetic and the rest of them.\r\n\r\n[14] Bradley's criticisms of rationalistic idealism should have made the\r\nforce of this point reasonably familiar.\r\n\r\n[15] The common statement that primitive man projects his own volitions,\r\nemotions, etc., into objects is but a back-handed way of expressing the\r\ntruth that \"objects,\" etc., have only gradually emerged from their\r\nlife-matrix. Looking back, it is almost impossible to avoid the fallacy\r\nof supposing that somehow such objects were there first and were\r\nafterward emotionally appreciated.\r\n\r\n[16] Of course, this very element may be the precarious, the ideal, and\r\npossibly fanciful of some other situation. But it is to change the\r\nhistoric into the absolute to conclude that therefore everything is\r\nuncertain, all at once, or as such. This gives metaphysical skepticism\r\nas distinct from the working skepticism which is an inherent factor in\r\nall reflection and scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\n[17] But this is a slow progress within reflection. Plato, who was\r\ninfluential in bringing this general distinction to consciousness, still\r\nthought and wrote as if \"image\" were itself a queer sort of objective\r\nexistence; it was only gradually that it was disposed of as psychical,\r\nor a phase of immediate experience.\r\n\r\n[18] Of course, this means that what is excluded and so left behind in\r\nthe problem of determination of _this_ objective content is regarded as\r\npsychical. With reference to other problems and aims this same psychic\r\nexistence is initial, not survival. Released from its prior absorption\r\nin some unanalyzed experience it gains standing and momentum on its own\r\naccount; _e. g._, the \"personal equation\" represents what is eliminated\r\nfrom a given astronomic time-determination as being purely subjective,\r\nor \"source-of-error.\" But it is initiatory in reference to new modes of\r\ntechnique, re-readings of previous data--new considerations in\r\npsychology, even new socio-ethical judgments. Moreover, it remains a\r\nfact, and even a worthful fact, as a part of one's own \"inner\"\r\nexperience, as an immediate _psychical reality_. That is to say, there\r\nis a region of _personal_ experience (mainly emotive or affectional)\r\nalready recognized as a sphere of value. The \"source of error\" is\r\ndisposed of by making it a _fact_ of this region. The recognition of\r\nfalsity does not _originate_ the psychic (p. 38, note).\r\n\r\n[19] Of course, this is a further reflective distinction. The plain man\r\nand the student do not determine the extraneous, irrelevant, and\r\nmisleading matter as image in a _psychological_ sense, but only as\r\n_fanciful_ or fantastic. Only to the psychologist and for _his_ purpose\r\ndoes it break up into image and meaning.\r\n\r\n[20] Bradley, more than any other writer, has seized upon this double\r\nantithesis, and used it first to condemn the logical as such, and then\r\nturned it around as the impartial condemnation of the psychical also.\r\nSee _Appearance and Reality_. In chap. 15 he metes out condemnation to\r\n\"thought\" because it can never take in the psychical existence or\r\nreality which is present; in chap. 19, he passes similar judgment upon\r\nthe \"psychical\" because it is brutally fragmentary. Other\r\nepistemological logicians have wrestled--or writhed--with this problem,\r\nbut I believe Bradley's position is impregnable--from the standpoint of\r\nready-made differences. When the antithesis is treated as part and lot\r\nof the process of defining the truth of a particular subject-matter, and\r\nthus as historic and relative, the case is quite otherwise.\r\n\r\n[21] Vol. I, pp. 28-34.\r\n\r\n[22] It is interesting to see how explicitly Lotze is compelled finally\r\nto differentiate two aspects in the antecedents of thoughts, one of\r\nwhich is necessary in order that there may be anything to call out\r\nthought (a lack, or problem); the other in order that when thought is\r\nevoked it may find data at hand--that is, material in shape to receive\r\nand respond to its exercise. \"The manifold matter of ideas is brought\r\nbefore us, not only in the _systematic order of its qualitative\r\nrelationships_, but in the rich _variety of local and temporal\r\ncombinations_.... The _combinations of heterogeneous ideas_ ... forms\r\nthe _problems_, in connection with which the efforts of thought to\r\nreduce coexistence to coherence will _subsequently_ be made. The\r\n_homogeneous or similar_ ideas, on the other hand, give occasion to\r\nseparate, to connect, and to count their repetitions.\" (Vol. I, pp. 33,\r\n34; italics mine.) Without the heterogeneous variety of the local and\r\ntemporal juxtapositions there would be nothing to excite thought.\r\nWithout the systematic arrangement of quality there would be nothing to\r\nmeet thought and reward it for its efforts. The homogeneity of\r\nqualitative relationships, _in the pre-thought material_, gives the\r\ntools or instruments by which thought is enabled successfully to tackle\r\nthe heterogeneity of collocations and conjunctions also found in the\r\nsame material! One would suppose that when Lotze reached this point he\r\nmight have been led to suspect that in this remarkable adjustment of\r\nthought-stimuli, thought-material, and thought-tools to one another, he\r\nmust after all be dealing, not with something prior to the\r\nthought-function, but with the necessary elements in and of the\r\nthought-situation.\r\n\r\n[23] _Supra_, p. 30.\r\n\r\n[24] For the identity of sensory experience with the point of greatest\r\nstrain and stress in conflicting or tensional experience, see \"The\r\nReflex Arc Concept in Psychology,\" _Psychological Review_, Vol. III, p.\r\n57.\r\n\r\n[25] For the \"accessory\" character of thought, see LOTZE, Vol. I, pp. 7,\r\n25-7, 61, etc.\r\n\r\n[26] BOSANQUET, _Logic_ (Vol. I, pp. 30-34), and Jones (_Philosophy of\r\nLotze_, 1895, chap. 4) have called attention to a curious inconsistency\r\nin Lotzes's treatment of judgment. On one hand, the statement is as\r\ngiven above. Judgment grows out of conception in making explicit the\r\ndetermining relation of universal to its own particular, implied in\r\nconception. But, on the other hand, judgment grows not out of conception\r\nat all, but out of the question of determining connection in change.\r\nLotze's nominal reason for this latter view is that the conceptual world\r\nis purely static; since the actual world is one of change, we need to\r\npass upon what really goes together (is causal) in the change as\r\ndistinct from such as are merely coincident. But, as Jones clearly\r\nshows, it is also connected with the fact that, while Lotze nominally\r\nasserts that judgment grows out of conception, he treats conception as\r\nthe result of judgment since the first view makes judgment a mere\r\nexplication of the content of an idea, and hence merely expository or\r\nanalytic (in the Kantian sense) and so of more than doubtful\r\napplicability to reality. The affair is too large to discuss here, and I\r\nwill content myself with referring to the oscillation between\r\nconflicting contents, and gradation of sensory qualities already\r\ndiscussed (p. 56, note). It is judgment which grows out of the former,\r\nbecause judgment is the whole situation as such; conception is referable\r\nto the latter because it _is_ one abstraction within the whole (the\r\nsolution of possible meanings of the data) just as the datum is another.\r\nIn truth, since the sensory datum is not absolute, but comes in a\r\nhistorical context, the qualities apprehended as constituting the datum\r\nsimply define the locus of conflict in the entire situation. They are\r\nattributives of the contents-in-tension of the colliding things, not\r\ncalm untroubled ultimates. On pp. 33 and 34 of Vol. I, Lotze recognizes\r\n(as we have just seen) that, as matter of fact, it is both sensory\r\nqualities in their systematic grading, or quantitative determinations\r\n(see Vol. I, p. 43, for the recognition of the necessary place of the\r\nquantitative in the true concept), _and_ the \"rich variety of local and\r\ntemporal combinations,\" that provoke thought and supply it with\r\nmaterial. But, as usual, he treats this simply as a historical accident,\r\nnot as furnishing the key to the whole matter. In fine, while the\r\nheterogeneous collocations and successions constitute the problematic\r\nelement that stimulates thought, quantitative determination of the\r\nsensory quality furnishes one of the two chief means through which\r\nthought deals with the problem. It is a reduction of the original\r\ncolliding contents to a form in which the effort at redintegration gets\r\nmaximum efficiency. The concept, as ideal meaning, is of course the\r\nother partner to the transaction. It is getting the various possible\r\nmeanings-of-the-data into such shape as to make them most useful in\r\nconstruing the data. The bearing of this upon the subject and predicate\r\nof judgment cannot be discussed here.\r\n\r\n[27] See Vol. I, pp. 38, 59, 61, 105, 129, 197, for Lotze's treatment of\r\nthese distinctions.\r\n\r\n[28] Vol. I, p. 36; see also Vol. II, pp. 290, 291.\r\n\r\n[29] Vol. II, p. 246; the same is reiterated in Vol. II, p. 250, where\r\nthe question of origin is referred to as a corruption in logic. Certain\r\npsychical acts are necessary as \"conditions and occasions\" of logical\r\noperations, but the \"deep gulf between psychical mechanism and thought\r\nremains unfilled.\"\r\n\r\n[30] _Philosophy of Lotze_, chap. 3, \"Thought and the Preliminary\r\nProcess of Experience.\"\r\n\r\n[31] Vol. I, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[32] Vol. I, p. 13; last italics mine.\r\n\r\n[33] Vol. I, p. 14; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[34] See Vol. I, pp. 16-20. On p. 22 this work is declared to be not\r\nonly the first, but the most indispensable of all thought's operations.\r\n\r\n[35] Vol. I, p. 26.\r\n\r\n[36] Vol. I, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[37] Vol. I, p. 36; see the strong statements already quoted, p. 30.\r\nWhat if this canon were applied in the first act of thought referred to\r\nabove: the original objectification which transforms the mere state into\r\nan abiding quality or meaning? Suppose, that is, it were said that the\r\nfirst objectifying act cannot make a substantial (or attached) quale out\r\nof a mere state of feeling; it must _find_ the distinction it makes\r\nthere already! It is clear we should at once get a _regressus ad\r\ninfinitum_. We here find Lotze face to face with this fundamental\r\ndilemma: thought either arbitrarily forces in its own distinctions, or\r\nelse just repeats what is already there--is either falsifying or futile.\r\nThis same contradiction, so far as it affects the impression, has\r\nalready been discussed. See p. 31.\r\n\r\n[38] Vol. I, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[39] As we have already seen, the concept, the meaning as such, is\r\nalways a factor or status in a reflective situation; it is always a\r\npredicate of judgment, in use in interpreting and developing the logical\r\nsubject, or datum of perception. See Study VII, on the Hypothesis.\r\n\r\n[40] ROYCE, in his _World and Individual_, Vol. I, chaps. 6 and 7, has\r\ncriticised the conception of meaning as valid, but in a way which\r\nimplies that there is a difference between validity and reality, in the\r\nsense that the meaning or content of the valid idea becomes real only\r\nwhen it is experienced in direct feeling. The above implies, of course,\r\na difference between validity and reality, but finds the test of\r\nvalidity in exercise of the function of direction or control to which\r\nthe idea makes pretension or claim. The same point of view would\r\nprofoundly modify Royce's interpretation of what he terms \"inner\" and\r\n\"outer\" meaning. See MOORE, _The University of Chicago Decennial\r\nPublications_, Vol. III, on \"Existence, Meaning, and Reality.\"\r\n\r\n[41] Vol. II, pp. 257, 265 and in general Book III, chap. 4. It is\r\nsignificant that thought itself, appearing as an act of thinking over\r\nagainst its own content, is here treated as psychical. Even this\r\nexplicit placing of thinking in the psychical sphere, along with\r\nsensations and the associative mechanism, does not, however, lead Lotze\r\nto reconsider his statement that the psychological problem is totally\r\nirrelevant and even corrupting as regards the logical. Consequently, as\r\nwe see in the text, it only gives him one more difficulty to wrestle\r\nwith: how a process which is _ex officio_ purely psychical and\r\nsubjective can yet yield results which are valid, in a logical, to say\r\nnothing of an ontological, sense.\r\n\r\n[42] Professor James's satisfaction in the\r\ncontemplation of bare pluralism, of disconnection, of radical\r\nhaving-nothing-to-do-with-one-another, is a case in point. The\r\nsatisfaction points to an æsthetic attitude in which the brute diversity\r\nbecomes itself one interesting object; and thus unity asserts itself in\r\nits own denial. When discords are hard and stubborn, and intellectual\r\nand practical unification are far to seek, nothing is commoner than the\r\ndevice of securing the needed unity by recourse to an emotion which\r\nfeeds on the very brute variety. Religion and art and romantic affection\r\nare full of examples.\r\n\r\n[43] Lotze even goes so far in this connection as to say that the\r\nantithesis between our ideas and the objects to which they are directed\r\nis itself a part of the world of ideas (Vol. II, p. 192). Barring the\r\nphrase \"world of _ideas_\" (as against world of continuous experiencing)\r\nhe need only have commenced at this point to have traveled straight and\r\narrived somewhere. But it is absolutely impossible to hold both this\r\nview and that of the original independent existence of something given\r\nto and in thought and an independent existence of a thought-activity,\r\nthought-forms, and thought-contents.\r\n\r\n[44] The criticism of Bosanquet's theory of the judgment offered in this\r\npaper is from the standpoint of the theory of the judgment developed by\r\nProfessor John Dewey, in his lectures on \"The Theory of Logic.\" While\r\nthe chief interest of the paper, as the title implies, is critical, it\r\nhas been necessary to devote a portion of it to the exposition of the\r\npoint of view from which the criticism is made.--H. B. T.\r\n\r\n[45] The references throughout this paper are to the pages of Vol. I of\r\nBERNARD BOSANQUET, _Logic or the Morphology of Knowledge_, Oxford, 1888.\r\n\r\n[46] F. H. BRADLEY, _Principles of Logic_, p. 64.\r\n\r\n[47] The difficulty, of course, is not a merely formal one, much less a\r\nverbal one. Instinctively we grant to Bosanquet his statement that\r\nreality is a continuous whole; we feel it almost captious to question\r\nhis right to it. But why? Because the _content of judgment_ is\r\ncontinuous; judgment is always engaged with the determination of a\r\nrelated totality. But if all content is ideal, and judgment is just the\r\napplication of this content to reality in virtue of an isolated contact,\r\nsurely it begs the entire question to say that reality apart from the\r\ncontent applied is continuous, and then to use this assertion to justify\r\nthe objective validity of the judgment--its element of permanent truth.\r\n\r\n[48] There is good reason for believing that Mr. Bosanquet escapes, in\r\nhis own mind, the difficulty by the term \"correspondence.\" \"The name\r\nstands for these elements in the idea which _correspond_ in the separate\r\nworlds;\" we may even be accused of injustice in confusing this\r\ncorrespondence with bare identity of existence. But if one idea\r\ncorresponds to another in the sense of referring to it, what is this but\r\nthe fact to be explained--how an existence can refer beyond itself?\r\n\r\n[49] This conclusion is clearly recognized by BRADLEY, _Appearance and\r\nReality_, chap. 4.\r\n\r\n[50] It would be suggestive to inquire in what sense conscious thought\r\nclaims to know. Is it a general claim which thought _qua_ thought puts\r\nforth, or is it the claim of the content of some particular thought? The\r\nformer, of course, is a mere pious aspiration having no reference to\r\nspecific validity or truth; the latter is precisely the problem under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[51] Bosanquet would seem to have followed Lotze in this insertion of a\r\nworld of \"meanings\" intermediate between the individual idea as such and\r\nthe real object as such. See the criticism already passed, pp. 93-5.\r\n\r\n[52] Or, the situation as questioned is itself a fact, and a perfectly\r\ndeterminate (though not determined) one. See pp. 38, 50.\r\n\r\n[53] Of course, the distinction between the process of arriving as\r\ntemporal, and the essential relation of subject and predicate as\r\neternal, harks back to the notion of judgment as the process by which\r\n\"we\" reproduce, or make real for ourselves, a reality already real\r\nwithin itself. And it involves just the same difficulties. The relation\r\nof subject and predicate--this simultaneous distinction and mutual\r\nreference--has meaning only in an act of adjustment, of attempt to\r\ncontrol, within which we distribute our conditions. When the act is\r\ncompleted, the relation of subject and predicate, as subject and\r\npredicate, quite disappears. An eternal relation of the two is\r\nmeaningless; we might as well talk of an eternal reaching for the same\r\ndistant object by the same hand. In such conceptions, we have only\r\ngrasped a momentary phase of a situation, isolated it, and set it up as\r\nan entity. Significant results would be reached by considering the\r\n\"synthetic\" character (in the Kantian sense) of judgment from this point\r\nof view. All modern logicians agree that judgment must be ampliative,\r\nmust extend knowledge; that a \"trifling proposition\" is no judgment at\r\nall. What does this mean save that judgment is developmental,\r\ntransitive, in effect and purport? And yet these same writers conceive\r\nof Reality as a _finished system of content in a complete and\r\nunchangeable single Judgment_! It is impossible to evade the\r\ncontradiction save by recognizing that since it is the business of\r\njudgment to transform, its test (or Truth) is successful performance of\r\nthe particular transformation it has set itself, and that transformation\r\nis temporal.\r\n\r\n[54] It is worth considering whether this may not be the reality of\r\nRoyce's distinction between outer and inner meaning. An anticipation of\r\nexperience is the working prerequisite of the control which will realize\r\nthe idea, _i. e._, the experience anticipated. One is no more \"inner\" or\r\n\"outer\" than the other.\r\n\r\n[55] _Logik_, p. 304.\r\n\r\n[56] DE MORGAN, _Budget of Paradoxes_, pp. 55, 56; quoted by WELTON,\r\n_Logic_, Vol. II, p. 60.\r\n\r\n[57] Advanced grammarians treat this matter in a way which should be\r\ninstructive to logicians. The hypothesis, says SWEET (§ 295 of _A New\r\nEnglish Grammar, Logical and Historical_, Oxford, 1892), suggests an\r\naffirmation or negation \"as objects of thought.\" \"In fact, we often say\r\n_supposing_ (that is, 'thinking') _it is true_, instead of _if it is\r\ntrue_.\" In a word, the hypothetical judgment as such puts explicitly\r\nbefore us the content of thought, of the predicate or hypothesis; and in\r\nso far is a moment in judgment rather than adequate judgment itself.\r\n\r\n[58] This carries with it, of course, the notion that \"sensation\" and\r\n\"image\" are not distinct psychical existences in themselves, but are\r\ndistinguished logical forces.\r\n\r\n[59] Concerning the strict correlativity of subject and predicate, data\r\nand hypothesis, see p. 34.\r\n\r\n[60] _Novum Organum_, Vol. I, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[61] Newton's \"Rules for Philosophizing\" (_Principia_, Book III) are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nRule I. \"No more causes of natural things are to be admitted than such\r\nas are both true, and sufficient to explain the phenomena of those\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\nRule II. \"Natural effects of the same kind are to be referred as far as\r\npossible to the same causes.\"\r\n\r\nRule III. \"Those qualities of bodies that can neither be increased nor\r\ndiminished in intensity, and which are found to belong to all bodies\r\nwithin reach of our experiments are to be regarded as qualities of all\r\nbodies whatever.\"\r\n\r\nRule IV. \"In experimental philosophy propositions collected by induction\r\nfrom phenomena are to be regarded either as accurately true or very\r\nnearly true notwithstanding any contrary hypothesis, till other\r\nphenomena occur, by which they are made more accurate or are rendered\r\nsubject to exceptions.\"\r\n\r\n[62] Book III, chap. 2, sec. 5; italics mine.

While quite\r\nindependent in treatment, the two papers supplement each other.\r\n\r\n[88] The best special illustration of this truth with which I am\r\nacquainted is presented for the science of chemistry in an article by F.\r\nWALD, \"Die Genesis der stöchiometrischen Grundgesetze,\" in _Zeitschrift\r\nfür physikalische Chemie_, Vol. XVIII (1895), pp. 337 ff.\r\n\r\n[89] [Greek: Xi] 201, 246.\r\n\r\n[90] H 99.\r\n\r\n[91] In allusion to fr. 90 (DIELS). DIELS finds in fr. 108 (fr. 18,\r\nBYWATER), [Greek: oti sophon esti pantôn kechôrismenon] the thought that\r\nGod is the Absolute, comparing the [Greek: Nous] of Anaxagoras and the\r\n[Greek: chôristê idea] of Plato and the [Greek: ousia chôristê] of\r\nAristotle. He assumes that [Greek: sophon]=[Greek: logos] and concedes\r\ngreat significance to the fragment. But this interpretation is utterly\r\nincompatible with everything else that we know of Heraclitus, and should\r\nbe admitted only if it were the only one admissible. ZELLER discusses\r\nthe fragment at length, Vol. I, p. 629, 1. If Diels's interpretation be\r\naccepted, the exposition above given of Heraclitus's logical position\r\nmust be abandoned.\r\n\r\n[92] It has been, and in some quarters is still, the fashion to say that\r\nHeraclitus is the originator of the doctrine of relativity; but Zeller\r\nis quite right in denying the charge. No doubt his teachings lent\r\nthemselves readily to such a development, but he did not so express\r\nhimself. According to him the _contrarieties coexist in the process_.\r\n\r\n[93] _Cf._ RITTER-PRELLER, § 65_c_.\r\n\r\n[94] This, in a word, is the burden of my study of _The Necessary and\r\nthe Contingent in the Aristotelian System_.\r\n\r\n[95] I have in preparation a study of the problem of physical\r\ninteraction in Pre-Socratic philosophy which deals with this question in\r\nall its phases.\r\n\r\n[96] This statement is, of course, figurative, since Empedocles denied\r\nthe existence of a void.\r\n\r\n[97] I cannot now undertake a defense of this statement, which runs\r\ncounter to certain ancient reports, but must reserve a full discussion\r\nfor my account of physical interaction.\r\n\r\n[98] The motive for making this assumption was clearly the desire to\r\nmake of the [Greek: Nous] the prime mover in the world while exempting\r\nit from reaction on the part of the world, which would have been\r\nunavoidable if its nature had contained parts of other things. It is the\r\nsame problem of \"touching without being touched in return\" that led\r\nAristotle to a similar definition of God and of the rational soul. The\r\nsame difficulty besets the absolutely \"simple\" soul of Plato's _Phaedo_\r\nand the causality of the Ideas.\r\n\r\n[99] ARISTOTLE, _De Generatione et Corruptione_, 323^b 10 f.\r\n\r\n[100] We have seen that this distinction was latent in Anaximenes's\r\nprocess of rarefaction and condensation. For other matters see CHAIGNET,\r\n_Histoire de la Psychologie_, Vol. I, p. 114, whose account, however,\r\nneeds to be corrected in some particulars.\r\n\r\n[101] I say \"perhaps\" because ancient reports differ as to the precise\r\nrelation of position and arrangement to the distinction between\r\nqualities, primary and secondary.\r\n\r\n[102] This is only another instance of what MR. VENN (_Empirical Logic_,\r\np. 56) has wittily alluded to as \"screwing up the cause and the effect\r\ninto close juxtaposition.\"\r\n\r\n[103] Simplicius says [Greek: euthys meta to prooimion]; see DIELS, _Die\r\nFragmente der Vorsokratiker_ (Berlin, 1903), p. 347, l. 18.\r\n\r\n[104] Fr. 2, DIELS.\r\n\r\n[105] See DIELS, _Fragmente der Vorsokratiker_, p. 343, l. 2; p. 344, l.\r\n27.\r\n\r\n[106] 320 C f.\r\n\r\n[107] Considerations of space as well as circumstances attending the\r\nimmediate preparation of this discussion for the press have precluded\r\nany but the most general and casual reference to the recent literature\r\nof the subject. Much of this literature only imperfectly distinguishes\r\nthe logical and psychological points of view, so that critical reference\r\nto it, unaccompanied by detailed restatement and analysis of the\r\npositions criticised, would be useless.\r\n\r\n[108] In order to avoid complicating the problems, we have here employed\r\nthe common notion that the physical world, physical object, and property\r\nmay be taken for granted as possible adequate contents of judgment, and\r\nthat the problem is only as to the objectivity of economic and ethical\r\ncontents. Of course we may, in the end, come to believe that the\r\n\"physical\" object is itself an economic construct, in the large sense of\r\n\"economic;\" that is, an instrument of an effective or successful\r\nexperience. Thus in terms of the illustration used above, in the\r\nattitude of entertaining in a general way the plan of building a house\r\n_of some sort or other_, one may have before him various building\r\nmaterials the ascertained qualities of which are, it may be, socially\r\nrecognized as in a general way fitting them for such a use. There is\r\ndoubtless so much of real foundation for the common notion here referred\r\nto. But along with the _definition_ of the plan in ethical and economic\r\njudgment, along with the determination actually to build a house, and a\r\nhouse of a certain specific kind, must go _further_ determination of the\r\nmeans in their physical aspects, a determination which all the while\r\nreacts into the process of determination of the end. See below, p. 246,\r\nnote 3.\r\n\r\n[109] In the moral life, as elsewhere, the distinction of deduction and\r\ninduction is one of degree. There is but one _type_ or _method_ of\r\ninference, though some inferences may approach more closely than do\r\nothers the limit of pure \"subsumption.\"\r\n\r\n[110] See III below.\r\n\r\n[111] It is no part of the present view that the ends which enter into\r\neconomic conflict are incapable of becoming organic and intrinsically\r\ninterrelated members of the provisional system of life. On the contrary,\r\nthe very essence of our contention is that adjustment established\r\nbetween two such conflicting ends in economic judgment is in itself\r\nethical and a member of the provisional system of the individual's ends\r\nof life, and will stand as such, subject to modification through changes\r\nelsewhere in the system, so long as the economic conditions in view of\r\nwhich it was determined remained unchanged. The \"mutual exclusiveness\"\r\nof the ends in ethical deliberation is simply the correlate of a\r\nrelative fixity in certain of the conditions of life. A man's command\r\nover the means of obtaining such things as books and fuel varies much\r\nand often suddenly in a society like ours from time to time; but, on the\r\nother hand, his physical condition, his intelligence, his powers of\r\nsympathy, and his spiritual capacity for social service commonly do not.\r\nHence there can be and is a certain more or less definite and permanent\r\ncomprehensive scheme of conduct morally obligatory upon him so far as\r\nthe exercise of these latter faculties is concerned, but so far as his\r\nconduct depends upon the variable conditions mentioned, it cannot be\r\nprescribed in general terms, nor will any provisional ideal of moral\r\nselfhood admit any such prescriptions as integral elements into itself.\r\nThe moral self is an ideal construct based upon these fixed conditions\r\nof life--conditions so fixed that the spiritual furtherance or\r\ndeterioration likely to result from certain modes of conduct involving\r\nand affecting them can be estimated directly and with relative ease by\r\nthe \"ethical\" method of judgment. Implied in such a construct is, of\r\ncourse, a reference to certain relatively permanent social and also\r\nphysical conditions. In so far as society and physical nature, and for\r\nthat matter the individual's own nature, are _variable_, these are the\r\nsubjects of \"scientific\" or \"factual\" judgments incidental to the\r\ndetermination of problems by the \"economic\" method--problems, that is,\r\nfor which no _general_ answer, through reference to a more or less\r\ndefinite and stable working concept of the self, can be given. Thus our\r\nknowledge of the physical universe is largely, if not chiefly,\r\nincidental to and conditioned by our economic experience. Again, our\r\neconomic judgments are in every case determinative of the self in\r\nsituations in which, as presented by (perhaps even momentarily) variable\r\nconditions, physical, social, or personal, the ethical method is\r\ninapplicable. In a socialistic state, in which economic conditions might\r\nbe more stable than in our present one, many problems in consumption\r\nwhich now are economic in one sense would be ethical because admitting\r\nof solution by reference to the type of self presupposed in the\r\nestablished state program of production and distribution. Even now it is\r\nnot easy to specify an economic situation the solution of which is\r\nabsolutely indifferent ethically. There is a possibility of intemperance\r\neven in so \"æsthetic\" an indulgence as Turkish rugs.\r\n\r\n[112] Accordingly there can be no distinction of ends, some as ethical,\r\nothers as economic, but from an ethical standpoint indifferent, and yet\r\nothers as amenable neither to ethical nor to economic judgment. The type\r\nof situation and the corresponding mode of judgment employed determines\r\nwhether an end shall be for the time being ethical, economic, or of\r\nneither sort conspicuously.\r\n\r\n[113] The right of Prudence to rank among the virtues cannot, on our\r\npresent view, be questioned. Economic judgment, though it must be\r\nvaluation of means, is essentially choice of ends--and, as would appear,\r\nchoice of a sort peculiarly difficult by reason of the usually slight\r\nintrinsic relation between the ends involved and also by reason of the\r\nabsence of effective points of view for comparison. Culture, as Emerson\r\nremarks, \"sees prudence not to be a several faculty, but a name for\r\nwisdom and virtue conversing with the body and its wants.\" And again,\r\n\"The spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the god of sots and\r\ncowards, and is the subject of all comedy.... [The true prudence] takes\r\nthe laws of the world whereby man's being is conditioned, as they are,\r\nand keeps these laws that it may enjoy their proper good\" (Essay on\r\n_Prudence_).\r\n\r\n[114] Here again we purposely use inaccurate language. Strictly, the\r\nends here spoken of as competing are such, we must say, only because\r\nthey are as yet in a measure indeterminate, wanting in \"clearness,\" and\r\nare not yet understood in their true economic character; likewise the\r\nmeans are wanting in that final shade or degree of physical and\r\nmechanical determinateness which they are presently to possess as means\r\nto a finally determinate economic end. Thus economic judgment, by which\r\nis to be understood determination of an end of action by the economic\r\nmethod and in accordance with economic principles, involves in general\r\nphysical re-determination of the means. The means which at the outset of\r\nthe present economic judgment-process appear as physically available\r\nindifferently for either of the tentative ends under consideration are\r\nonly in a general way the same means for knowledge as they will be when\r\nthe economic problem has been solved. They are, so far as now\r\ndeterminate, the outcome of former physical judgment-processes\r\nincidental to the definition of economic ends in former situations like\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n[115] In our discussion of this preliminary question there is no attempt\r\nto furnish what might be called an _analysis_ of the consciousness of\r\nobjectivity. This has been undertaken by various psychologists in recent\r\nwell-known contributions to the subject. For our purpose it is necessary\r\nonly to specify the intellectual and practical attitude out of which the\r\nconsciousness of objectivity arises; not the sensory \"elements\" or\r\nfactors involved in its production as an experience.\r\n\r\n[116] So, on the other hand, our vague organic sensations are possibly\r\nmore instructive as they are, _for their own purpose_, than they would\r\nbe if more sharply discriminated and complexly referred.\r\n\r\nFor convenience we here meet the view under consideration with its own\r\nterminology; we by no means wish to be understood as indorsing this\r\nterminology as psychologically correct. The sense-quality of which we\r\nread in \"structural psychology\" is, we hold, not a structural unit at\r\nall, but in fact a highly abstract development out of that unorganized\r\nwhole of sensory experience in which reflective attention begins. There\r\nis, for example, no such thing as the simple unanalyzable sense-quality\r\n\"red\" in consciousness until judgment has proceeded far enough to have\r\nconstructed a definite and measured experience which may be symbolized\r\nas \"object-before-me-possessing-the-attribute-red.\" In place of the\r\noriginal sensory total-experience we now have a more or less developed\r\nperceptual (_i. e._, judgmental) total-experience. It is an instance of\r\nthe \"psychological fallacy\" to interpret what are really elements of\r\n_meaning_ in a perceived object constructed in judgment (for this is the\r\ntrue nature of the \"simple idea of sensation\" or \"sense-element\") as so\r\nmany bits of psychical material which were isolated from each other at\r\nthe outset, and have been externally joined together in their present\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n[117] The phrase is Külpe's and is used in his sense of consciousness\r\ntaken as a whole, as, for example, attentive, apperceptive, volitional,\r\nrather than in the sense made familiar by Spencer and others.\r\n\r\n[118] The foregoing discussion is in many ways similar to Brentano's\r\nupon the same subject. In discussing his first class of modes of\r\nconsciousness, the _Vorstellungen_, he says: \"We find no contrasts\r\nbetween presentations excepting those of the objects to which the\r\npresentations refer. Only in so far as warm and cold, light and dark, a\r\nhigh note and a low, form contrasts can we speak of the corresponding\r\npresentations as contrasted; and, in general, there is in any other\r\nsense than this no contrast within the entire range of these conscious\r\nprocesses\" (_Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkte_, Bd. I, p. 29).\r\nThis may stand as against any attempt to find contrast between abstract\r\nsense-qualities taken apart from their objective reference. What is,\r\nhowever, the ground of distinction between the presented objects?\r\nApparently this must be answered in the last resort as above. In this\r\nsense we should need finally to interpret \"sensuous\" and \"material\" in\r\nterms of objectivity as above defined, rather than the reverse. They are\r\ncases in or specifications of the determination of adequate stimuli.\r\n\r\n[119] In this connection reference may be made to the well-known\r\ndisturbing effect of the forced introduction of attention to details\r\ninto established sensori-motor co-ordinations, such as \"typewriting,\"\r\nplaying upon the piano, and the like.\r\n\r\n[120] _Cf._ PROFESSOR BALDWIN'S _Social and Ethical Interpretations_,\r\nand PROFESSOR MCGILVARY'S recent paper on \"Moral Obligation,\"\r\n_Philosophical Review_, Vol. XI, especially pp. 349 f.\r\n\r\n[121] Manifestly, as indicated just above, this accepted value of the\r\nobject implies fuller physical knowledge of the object than was\r\npossessed at the outset of the economic judgment. See above, p. 234,\r\nnote; p. 246, note 3; and p. 271, below.\r\n\r\n[122] _Types of Ethical Theory_, Vol. II, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[123] See p. 253 above.\r\n\r\n[124] It is not so much the case that the object, on the one side,\r\nexcites in the agent's consciousness, on the other, the \"sensations of\r\nresistance\" which have played such a part in recent controversy on the\r\nsubject, as that (1) the object in certain of its promptings is\r\n\"resisting\" certain other of its promptings, or that (2) certain\r\n\"positive\" activities of the agent are being inhibited by certain\r\n\"negative\" activities, thereby giving rise to the \"emotion of\r\nresistance.\" That \"positive\" and \"negative\" are here used in a\r\nteleological way will be apparent. It is surely misleading to speak of\r\n\"_sensations_ of resistance\" even in deprecatory quotation marks, except\r\nas \"sensation\" is used in its everyday meaning, viz., experience of\r\nstrongly sensory quality.\r\n\r\n[125] The general theory of emotion which is here presupposed, and\r\nindeed is fundamental to the entire discussion, may be found in\r\nPROFESSOR DEWEY'S papers on \"The Theory of Emotion,\" _Psychological\r\nReview_, Vol. I, p. 553; Vol. II, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[126] Such is, in fact, the teaching of the various forms of ethical\r\nintuitionism, and we find it not merely implied, but explicitly\r\naffirmed, in a work in many respects so remote from intuitionism in its\r\nstandpoint as GREEN'S _Prolegomena to Ethics_. See pp. 178-81, and\r\nespecially pp. 355-9.\r\n\r\n[127] Sermon II.\r\n\r\n[128] Not to imply of course that psychologically or logically the\r\ndistinction of conditions and means is other than a convenient\r\nsuperficial one.\r\n\r\n[129] Manifestly we have here been approaching from a new direction the\r\n\"Recognition coefficient\" of reality described above. See p. 266.\r\n\r\n[130] This, if it were intended as an account of the genesis of\r\npsychology as a science and of the psychological interest on the part of\r\nthe individual, would doubtless be most inadequate. We have, for one\r\nthing, made no mention of the part which error and resulting practical\r\nfailure play in stimulating an interest in the _judgmental_ processes of\r\nobservation and the like, and in technique of the control of these.\r\nHere, as well as in the processes of _execution_ of our purposes, must\r\nbe found many of the roots of psychology as a science. Moreover, no\r\nexplanation has been offered above for the appropriation by the\r\n\"energetic\" self of these phenomena of interruption and retardation of\r\nits energy as being, in fact, its own, or within itself. The problem\r\nwould appear to be psychological, and so without our province, and we\r\ngladly pass it by.\r\n\r\n[131] We can, of course, undertake no minute analysis of the\r\npsychological mechanism or concatenation of the process here sketched in\r\nbarest outline. Our present purpose is wholly that of description.\r\nSlight as our account of the process of transition is, we give it space\r\nonly because it seems necessary to do so in order to make intelligible\r\nthe accounts yet to be given of the conscious valuation processes for\r\nwhich the movement here described prepares the way.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that we assume above that the purpose is _successful\r\nas planned_ and _by succeeding_ brings about the undesirable results.\r\nFailure in execution of the purpose as such could only, in the manner\r\nalready outlined, prompt a more adequate investigation of the _factual\r\nconditions_.\r\n\r\n[132] The case is not essentially altered in logical character if for\r\nthe Levitical law be substituted the general principles of the new\r\ndispensation read off details by an authoritative church or by \"private\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\n[133] A remark may be added here by way of caution. The presented self,\r\nwe have said, attenuates to a mere maxim or tacit presumption in favor\r\nof a certain type of logical procedure in dealing with the situation. It\r\nmust be remembered that the presented self, like all other presentation,\r\nis and comes to be for the sake of its function in experience, and so is\r\npractical from the start. The process sketched above is therefore not\r\nfrom bare presented content as such to a methodological presumption,\r\nwhich, as methodological and not contentual, is qualitatively different\r\nfrom what preceded it.\r\n\r\n[134] _Recognized_ authority is, of course, not the same thing by any\r\nmeans as authority unrecognized because absolutely dominant.\r\n\r\n[135] We may be pardoned for supplying from the history of ethics no\r\nillustrations of this slight sketch.\r\n\r\n[136] In fact, as suggested above, the _Prolegomena to Ethics_ is in\r\nmany respects essentially intuitional in spirit, though its intuitionism\r\nis of a modern discreetly attenuated sort.\r\n\r\n[137] This would appear to be the logical value of functional psychology\r\nas a science of mental process.\r\n\r\n[138] We have already given a slight sketch of the historical process\r\nhere characterized in the barest logical terms.\r\n\r\n[139] Further consideration of the problem of factual judgment must be\r\ndeferred to Part V.\r\n\r\n[140] The relation of the empirical self to the \"energetic\" and to\r\nstandards will come in for statement in Part V in the connection just\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n[141] It might be possible to construct a \"logic\" of these various types\r\nof working moral standard in such a way as to show that in each type\r\nthere is implied the one next higher morphologically, and ultimately the\r\nhighest--that is, some sort of concept of the \"energetic\" self.\r\n\r\n[142] It matters not at all whether, in ethics or metaphysics, our\r\nuniversal be abstract or on the other hand \"concrete,\" like Green's\r\nconception of the self, or a \"Hegelian\" Absolute. Its logical use in the\r\ndetermination of particulars must be essentially the same in either\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[143] In this connection reference may be made to MR. TAYLOR'S recent\r\nwork, _The Problem of Conduct_. Mr. Taylor reduces the moral life to\r\nterms of an ultimate conflict between the ideals of egoism and social\r\njustice, holding that the conflict is in theory irreconcilable. With\r\nthis negative attitude toward current standards in ethical theory one\r\nmay well be in accord without accepting Mr. Taylor's further contention\r\nthat a theory of ethics is therefore impossible. Because the \"ethics of\r\nsubsumption\" is demonstrably futile it by no means follows that a method\r\nof ethics cannot be developed along the lines of modern scientific logic\r\nwhich shall be as valid as the procedure of the investigator in the\r\nsciences. Mr. Taylor's _logic_ is virtually the same as that of the\r\nethical theories which he criticises; because an ethical _ideal_ is\r\nimpossible, a theory of ethics is impossible also. One is reminded of\r\nMR. BRADLEY'S criticism of knowledge in the closing chapters of the\r\n_Logic_ as an interesting parallel.\r\n\r\n[144] MR. BOSANQUET'S discussion of the place of the principle of\r\nteleology in analogical inference will be found suggestive in this\r\nconnection (_Logic_, Vol. II, chap. iii).\r\n\r\n[145] See above, p. 243 and p. 259 _ad fin._\r\n\r\n[146] We use the expression \"energy-_equivalent_\" because the \"excess\"\r\ngained by the self through the past adjustment is not of importance at\r\njust this point. The essential significance of the means now is not that\r\nthey \"cost\" less than they promised to bring in in energy, but that\r\n_because they required sacrifice the self will now lose unless they are\r\nallowed to fulfil the promise_. They are the logical equivalent of the\r\nestablished modes of consumption from the standpoint of conservation of\r\nthe energies of the self, not the mathematical equivalent.\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable, if there were space, to present a brief account\r\nof the psychological basis of the concepts of energy and\r\nenergy-equivalence which here come into play, but this must be omitted.\r\n\r\n[147] Putting it negatively, the renunciation of the new end involves a\r\n\"greater\" sacrifice than all the sacrifices which adherence to the\r\npresent system of consumption can compensate.\r\n\r\n[148] Green, as is well known, allows that any formulation of the ideal\r\nself must be incomplete, but holds that it is not for this reason\r\nuseless. But this is to assume that development in the ideal is never to\r\nbe radically reconstructive, that the ideal is to expand and fill out\r\nalong established and unchangeable lines of growth so that all increase\r\nshall be in the nature of accretion. The self as a system is fixed and\r\nall individual moral growth is in the nature of approximation to this\r\nabsolute ideal. This would appear to be essentially identical in a\r\nlogical sense with Mr. Spencer's hypothesis of social evolution as a\r\nprocess of gradual approach to a condition of perfect adaptation of\r\nsociety and the individual to each other in an environment to which\r\nsociety is perfectly adapted--a condition in which \"perfectly evolved\"\r\nindividuals shall live in a state of blessedness in conformity to the\r\nrequirements of \"absolute ethics.\" For a criticism of this latter type\r\nof view see MR. TAYLOR'S above-mentioned work (chap. v, _passim_).\r\n\r\n[149] For GREEN'S cautious defense of conscientiousness as a moral\r\nattitude see the _Prolegomena to Ethics_, Book IV, chap. i; and for a\r\nstatement of the present point of view as bearing upon Green's\r\ndifficulty, see DEWEY, _The Study of Ethics: A Syllabus_, p. 37 _ad\r\nfin._, and _Philosophical Review_, Vol. II, pp. 661, 662.\r\n\r\n[150] Along the line thus inadequately suggested might be found an\r\nanswer to certain criticisms of the attempt to dispense with a\r\nmetaphysical idea of the self. Such criticisms usually urge that without\r\nreference to a metaphysical ideal no meaning attaches to such\r\nconceptions as \"adjustment,\" \"expansion,\" \"furtherance,\" and the like as\r\npredicated of the moral acts of an agent in their effect upon the\r\n\"energetic\" self. Anything that one may do, it is said, is expansive of\r\nthe self, if it be something new, except as we judge it by a\r\nmetaphysical ideal of a rightly expanded self. For an excellent\r\nstatement of this general line of criticism see STRATTON, \"A\r\nPsychological Test of Virtue,\" _International Journal of Ethics_, Vol.\r\nXI, p. 200.\r\n\r\n[151] The polemic of certain recent writers (as, for example, EHRENFELS\r\nin his _System der Werttheorie_) against the objectivity of judgments of\r\nvalue appears to rest upon an uncritical acceptance of the time-honored\r\ndistinction between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" qualities as equivalent to\r\nthe logical distinction of subjective and objective. Thus EHRENFELS\r\nconfutes \"das Vorurteil von der objectiven Bedeutung des Wertbegriffes\"\r\nby explaining it as due to a misleading usage of speech expressive of\r\n\"an impulse, deep-rooted in the human understanding, to objectify its\r\npresentations\" and then goes on to say \"We do not desire things because\r\nwe recognize the presence in them of a mysterious impalpable essence of\r\nValue but we ascribe value to them because we desire them.\" (_Op. cit._,\r\nBd. I, p. 2.) This may serve to illustrate the easy possibility of\r\nconfusing the logical and psychological points of view, as likewise does\r\nEHRENFELS's formal definition of value. (Bd. I., p. 65.)\r\n\r\n[152] The essential dependence of factual judgment upon the rise of\r\neconomic and ethical conflict is implied in the widely current doctrine\r\nof the teleological character of knowledge. It is indeed nowadays\r\nsomething like a commonplace to say in one sense or another that\r\nknowledge is relative to ends, but it is not always recognized by those\r\nwho hold this view that an end never appears as such in consciousness\r\nalone. The end that guides in the construction of factual knowledge is\r\nan end in ethical or economic conflict with some other likewise\r\nindeterminate end in the manner above discussed.\r\n\r\n[153] See above, pp. 282, 283.\r\n\r\n[154] _Cf._ SCHILLER, _Riddles of the Sphinx_, chap. vii, §§ 10-14.\r\n\r\n[155] It would appear that the principle of the conservation of energy\r\nis valid only in the physical sphere; but the logical significance of\r\nthis limitation cannot be here discussed.\r\n\r\n[156] That the assumption mentioned is the essential basis of the twin\r\ntheories of associationism in psychology and hedonism in ethics is shown\r\nby DR. WARNER FITE in his article, \"The Associational Conception of\r\nExperience,\" _Philosophical Review_, Vol. IX, pp. 283 ff. _Cf._ MR.\r\nBRADLEY's remarks on the logic of hedonism in his _Principles of Logic_,\r\npp. 244-9.\r\n\r\n[157] The \"energetic\" self is apparently MR. BRADLEY'S fourth \"meaning\r\nof self,\" the self as monad--\"something moving parallel with the life of\r\na man, or, rather, something not moving, but literally _standing_ in\r\nrelation to his successive variety\" (_Appearance and Reality_ [1st ed.]\r\np. 86, in chap. ix, \"The Meanings of the Self\"). Mr. Bradley's\r\ndifficulty appears to come from his desiring a psychological content for\r\nwhat is essentially a logical conception--a confusion (if we may be\r\npermitted the remark) which runs through the entire chapter to which we\r\nrefer and is responsible for the undeniable and hopeless incoherency of\r\nthe various meanings of the self, as Mr. Bradley therein expounds them.\r\n\"If the monad stands aloof,\" says Mr. Bradley, \"either with no character\r\nat all or a private character apart, then it may be a fine thing in\r\nitself, but it is a mere mockery to call it the self of a man\" (p. 87).\r\nSurely this is to misconstrue and then find fault with that very\r\ncharacter of essential _logical_ apartness from any possibility of\r\ndetermination in point of descriptive psychological content which\r\nconstitutes the whole value of the \"energetic\" self as a logical\r\nconception stimulative of the valuation-process and so inevitably of\r\nfactual judgment. See pp. 258, 259, above. The reader may find for\r\nhimself in Mr. Bradley's enumeration of meanings our concept of the\r\nempirical self. But surely the \"energetic\" and empirical selves would\r\nappear on our showing to have no necessary conflict with each other.\r\n\r\n[158] In the first of these inseparable aspects valuation is\r\ndeterminative of Rightness and Wrongness; in the second it presents the\r\nobject as Good or Bad. See p. 259, above.\r\n\r\n[159] See, for example, WIESER, _Natural Value_ (Eng. trans.), p. 17.\r\n\r\n[160] See pp. 307-12 above.\r\n\r\n[161] The illustration, as also the general principle which it here is\r\nused to illustrate, was suggested some years since by Professor G. H.\r\nMead in a lecture course on the \"History of Psychology,\" which the\r\nwriter had the advantage of attending.\r\n\r\n[162] The conservative function of valuation may be further illustrated\r\nby reference to the well-known principle of marginal utility of which we\r\nhave already made mention (p. 307 above), and which has played so great\r\na part in modern economic theory. The value of the unit quantity of a\r\nstock of any commodity is, according to this principle, measured by the\r\nleast important single use in the schedule of uses to which the stock as\r\na whole is to be applied. Manifestly, then, adherence to this valuation\r\nplaced upon the unit quantity is in so far conservative of the whole\r\nschedule and the marginal value is a \"short-hand\" symbol expressive of\r\nthe value of the whole complex purpose presented in the schedule.\r\nMoreover, the increase of marginal value concurrently with diminution of\r\nthe stock through consumption, loss, or reapplication is not indicative\r\nso much of a change of purpose as of determination to adhere to so much\r\nof the original program of consumption as may still be possible of\r\nattainment with the depleted supply of the commodity.\r\n\r\n[163] Thus except on this condition we should deny the propriety of\r\nspeaking of the value of a friend or of a memento or sacred relic. The\r\npurpose of accurate definition of the function of such objects as these\r\nin the attainment of one's ends is foreign to the proper attitude of\r\nloving, prizing, or venerating them. We may ethically value the _act_ of\r\nsacrifice for a friend or of solicitous care of the memento, but the\r\nobject of our sacrifice or solicitude has simply the direct or immediate\r\n\"qualitative\" emotional character appropriate to the kinds of activity\r\nto which it is the adequate stimulus.\r\n\r\n[164] _History of Philosophy_ (TUFT's translation), p. 117.\r\n\r\n[165] _Cf._ PROFESSOR J. R. ANGELL's article, \"Relations of Structural\r\nand Functional Psychology to Philosophy,\" _Decennial Publications of the\r\nUniversity of Chicago_, Vol. III, pp. 10-12; also _Philosophical\r\nReview_, Vol. XII, No. 3. _Cf._ also MR. SCHILLER's essay on \"Axioms as\r\nPostulates\" in _Personal Idealism_.\r\n\r\n[166] From this point on this paper is an expansion of some paragraphs,\r\npp. 11-13, in an article on \"Existence, Meaning, and Reality,\" printed\r\nfrom Vol. III of the First Series of the _Decennial Publications of the\r\nUniversity of Chicago_.\r\n\r\n[167] P. 22.\r\n\r\n[168] Pp. 22, 23; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[169] P. 25.\r\n\r\n[170] P. 26.\r\n\r\n[171] p. 36; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[172] Pp. 22, 23; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[173] P. 307.\r\n\r\n[174] P. 327.\r\n\r\n[175] P. 23; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[176] _Cf._ p. 34; also p. 22.\r\n\r\n[177] P. 35.\r\n\r\n[178] This warns us that in the phrase, \"a plan of action,\" the term\r\n\"action\" must be more inclusive than it is in much current discussion.\r\nIt must not be limited to gymnastic performance. It must apply to any\r\nsort of activity planned for, and which, when it arrives, fulfils the\r\nplan. This, I take it, is the import of the paragraph at the top of p. 7\r\nof PROFESSOR JAMES's _Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results_.\r\n\r\n[179] P. 270.\r\n\r\n[180] Pp. 270, 271.\r\n\r\n[181] P. 276.\r\n\r\n[182] P. 277.\r\n\r\n[183] Pp. 280, 281.\r\n\r\n[184] See p. 256.\r\n\r\n[185] P. 289; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[186] P. 281; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[187] It is worth noting in passing that here the universal appears to\r\nbe located in finite experience, while the ground of the particular is\r\nin the absolute.\r\n\r\n[188] P. 282.\r\n\r\n[189] P. 284; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[190] P. 283.\r\n\r\n[191] P. 332.\r\n\r\n[192] P. 339.\r\n\r\n[193] This ghost of subjectivism haunts the entire part of the essay in\r\nwhich the final fulfilment of finite ideas is found in \"a certain\r\nabsolute system of ideas.\"\r\n\r\n[194] P. 330; italics mine.\r\n\r\n[195] P. 337.\r\n\r\n[196] P. 286.\r\n\r\n[197] P. 307.\r\n\r\n[198] P. 297.\r\n\r\n[199] This reduction of the purposive to the representative function\r\ncarries with it an interesting implication concerning the whole\r\ncharacter and relationship of thought and will. From beginning to end,\r\non almost every page, Mr. Royce insists upon the idea as an expression\r\nof will. At the outset we read: \"When we try to define the idea in\r\nitself, as a conscious fact, our best means is to lay stress upon the\r\nsort of will or active meaning which any idea involves for the mind that\r\nforms the idea\" (p. 22). Again: \"The idea is a will seeking its own\r\ndetermination. It is nothing else\" (p. 332)--and so on throughout the\r\nlectures. And we have already seen how consistently this is worked out\r\nin the analysis of concrete acts, such as singing, etc. But now, as\r\nrelated to the absolute system, the will, as embodied in the idea, is to\r\nfind its final determination in approximating the certain absolute\r\nsystem of ideas. This would seem to make will but little more than the\r\nmere form of representation itself. The idea is a will, but in its\r\nrelation to truth its will is \"to correspond even in its vagueness to\r\nits own final and completely individual expression.\"\r\n\r\n[200] P. 339.\r\n\r\n[201] P. 338.\r\n\r\n[202] P. 335.\r\n\r\n[203] _Cf._ MR.
