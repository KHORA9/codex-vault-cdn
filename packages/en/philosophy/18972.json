Thou Torment of every Heart! Thou Intellectual\r\nLight! I do not kiss the Dust of thy Feet; because thou seldom art\r\nseen out of the Seraglio, and when thou art, thou walkest only on\r\nthe Carpets of _Iran_, or on Beds of Roses.\r\n\r\nI here present you with a Translation of the Work of an ancient\r\n_Sage_, who having the Happiness of living free from all Avocations,\r\nthought proper, by Way of Amusement, to write the History of\r\n_Zadig_; a Performance, that comprehends in it more Instruction\r\nthan, 'tis possible, you may at first be aware of. I beg you would\r\nindulge me so far as to read it over, and then pass your impartial\r\nJudgment upon it: For notwithstanding you are in the Bloom of your\r\nLife; tho' ev'ry Pleasure courts you; tho' you are Nature's Darling,\r\nand have internal Qualities in proportion to your Beauty; tho' the\r\nWorld resounds your Praises from Morning till Night, and consequently\r\nyou must have a just Title to a superior Degree of Understanding\r\nthan the rest of your Sex; Yet your Wit is no ways flashy; Your\r\nTaste is refin'd, and I have had the Honour to hear you talk more\r\nlearnedly than the wisest _Dervise_, with his venerable Beard, and\r\npointed Bonnet: You are discreet, and yet not mistrustful; you are\r\neasy, but not weak; you are beneficent with Discretion; you love\r\nyour Friends, and create yourself no Enemies. Your most sprightly\r\nFlights borrow no Graces from Detraction; you never speak a\r\nmisbecoming Word, nor do an ill-natur'd Action, tho' 'tis always in\r\nyour Power. In a Word, your Soul is as spotless as your Person. You\r\nhave, moreover, a little Fund of Philosophy, which gives me just\r\nGrounds to hope that you'll relish this Historical Performance\r\nbetter than any other Lady of your Quality would do.\r\n\r\nIt was originally compos'd in the _Chaldean_ Language, to which both\r\nyou and my self are perfect Strangers. It was translated, however,\r\ninto _Arabic_, for the Amusement of the celebrated Sultan OULOUG-BEG.\r\nIt first appear'd in Public, when the _Arabian_ and _Persian_ Tales\r\nof One Thousand and One Nights, and One Thousand and One Days, were\r\nmost in Vogue: OULOUG chose rather to entertain himself with the\r\nAdventures of _Zadig_. The Sultanas indeed were more fond of the\r\nformer. How can you, said the judicious OULOUG, be so partial, as to\r\nprefer a Set of Tales, that are no ways interesting or instructive,\r\nto a Work, that has a Variety of Beauties to recommend it? Oh!\r\nreplied the Sultanas, the less Sense there is in them, the more they\r\nare in Taste; and the less their Merit, the greater their\r\nCommendation.\r\n\r\nI flatter my self, thou Patroness of Wisdom, that thou wilt not copy\r\nafter those thoughtless Sultanas, but give into the Sentiments of\r\nOULOUG. I am in hopes likewise, when you are tir'd with the\r\nConversation of such as make those senseless Romances abovemention'd\r\ntheir favourite Amusements, you will vouchsafe to listen for one\r\nMinute or two, to the Dictates of solid Sense. Had you been\r\n_Thalestris_ in the Days of _Scander_, the Son of _Philip_; had you\r\nbeen the Queen of _Sheba_, in the Reign of _Solomon_, those Kings\r\nwould have been proud to have taken a Tour to visit you.\r\n\r\nMay the Celestial Virtues grant, that your Pleasures may meet with\r\nno Interruption; your Charms know no Decay; and may your Felicity be\r\neverlasting!\r\n\r\n_SADI._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nApprobation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI, Who have subscrib'd my Name hereto, ambitious of being thought a\r\nMan of Wit and Learning, have perus'd this MANUSCRIPT, which I find,\r\nto my great Mortification, amusing, moral, philosophical, and fit to\r\nbe read, even by those who have an utter Aversion to Romances; for\r\nwhich Reason, I have depretiated it, as it deserves, and have in\r\ndirect Terms told the CADI-LESQUIER, that 'tis a most detestable\r\nPerformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

I.\r\n\r\n_The Blind_ EYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Reign of King _Moabdar_, there was a young Man, a Native of\r\n_Babylon_, by name _Zadig_; who was not only endowed by Nature with\r\nan uncommon Genius, but born of illustrious Parents, who bestowed on\r\nhim an Education no ways inferior to his Birth. Tho' rich and young,\r\nhe knew how to give a Check to his Passions; he was no ways\r\nself-conceited; he didn't always act up to the strictest Rules of\r\nReason himself, and knew how to look on the Foibles of others, with\r\nan Eye of Indulgence. Every one was surpriz'd to find, that\r\nnotwithstanding he had such a Fund of Wit, he never insulted; nay,\r\nnever so much as rallied any of his Companions, for that Tittle\r\nTattle, which was so vague and empty, so noisy and confus'd; for\r\nthose rash Reflections, those illiterate Conclusions, and those\r\ninsipid Jokes; and, in short, for that Flow of unmeaning Words,\r\nwhich was call'd polite Conversation in _Babylon_. He had learned\r\nfrom the first Book of _Zoroaster_, that Self-love is like a Bladder\r\nfull blown, which when once prick'd, discharges a kind of petty\r\nTempest. _Zadig_, in particular, never boasted of his Contempt of\r\nthe Fair Sex, or of his Facility to make Conquests amongst them. He\r\nwas of a generous Spirit; insomuch, that he was not afraid of\r\nobliging even an ungrateful Man; strictly adhering to that wise\r\nMaxim of _Zoroaster_. _When you are eating, throw an Offal to the\r\nDogs that are under the Table, lest they should be tempted to bite\r\nyou._ He was as wise as he could well be wish'd; since he was fond\r\nof no Company, but such as were distinguish'd for Men of Sense. As\r\nhe was well-grounded, in all the Sciences of the antient\r\n_Chaldeans_, he was no Stranger to those Principles of Natural\r\nPhilosophy, which were then known: And understood as much of\r\nMetaphysics as any one in all Ages after him; that is to say, he\r\nknew little or nothing of the Matter. He was firmly convinc'd, that\r\nthe Year consisted of 365 Days and an half, tho' directly repugnant\r\nto the new Philosophy of the Age he liv'd in; and that the Sun was\r\nsituated in the Center of the Earth; And when the Chief Magi told\r\nhim, with an imperious Air, that he maintain'd erroneous Principles;\r\nand that it was an Indignity offered to the Government under which\r\nhe liv'd, to imagine the Sun should roll round its own Axis, and\r\nthat the Year consisted of twelve Months, he knew how to sit still\r\nand quiet, without shewing the least Tokens of Resentment or\r\nContempt.\r\n\r\nAs _Zadig_ was immensely rich, and had consequently Friends without\r\nNumber; and as he was a Gentleman of a robust Constitution, and\r\nremarkably handsome; as he was endowed with a plentiful Share of\r\nready and inoffensive Wit: And, in a Word, as his Heart was\r\nperfectly sincere and open, he imagin'd himself, in some Measure,\r\nqualified to be perfectly happy. For which Purpose he determin'd to\r\nmarry a gay young Lady (one _Semira_ by name) whose Beauty, Birth\r\nand Fortune, render'd her the most desirable Person in all\r\n_Babylon_. He had a sincere Affection for her, grounded on Honour,\r\nand _Semira_ conceiv'd as tender a Passion for him. They were just\r\nupon the critical Minute of a mutual Conjunction in the Bands of\r\nMatrimony, when, as they were walking Hand in Hand together towards\r\none of the Gates of _Babylon_, under the Shade of a Row of\r\nPalm-trees, that grew on the Banks of the River _Euphrates_, they\r\nwere beset by a Band of Ruffians, arm'd with Sabres, Bows and\r\nArrows. They were the Guards, it seems, of young _Orcan_ (Nephew of\r\na certain Minister of State) whom the Parasites, kept by his Uncle,\r\nhad buoy'd up with a Permission to do, with Impunity, whatever he\r\nthought proper. This young Rival, tho' he had none of those internal\r\nQualities to boast of that _Zadig_ had, yet he imagin'd himself a\r\nMan of more Power; and for that Reason, was perfectly outrageous to\r\nsee the other preferr'd before him. This Fit of Jealousy, the Result\r\nof mere Vanity, prompted him to think that he was deeply in Love\r\nwith the fair _Semira_; and fir'd with that amorous Notion, he was\r\ndetermin'd to take her away from _Zadig_, by Dint of Arms. The\r\nRavishers rush'd rudely upon her, and in the Transport of their\r\nRage, drew the Blood of a Beauty, the Sight of whose Charms would\r\nhave soften'd the very Tigers of Mount _Imaues_. The injur'd Lady\r\nrent the very Heavens with her Exclamations. Where's my dear\r\nHusband, she cried? They have torn me from the Arms of the only Man\r\nwhom I adore. She never reflected on the Danger to which she was\r\nexpos'd; her sole Concern was for her beloved _Zadig_. At the same\r\nTime, he defended her, like a Lover, and a Man of Integrity and\r\nCourage. With the Assistance only of two domestic Servants, he put\r\nthose Sons of Violence to Flight, and conducted _Semira_, bloody as\r\nshe was, and in fainting Fits, to her own House. No sooner was she\r\ncome to her self, but she fix'd her lovely Eyes on her Dear\r\nDeliverer. O _Zadig_, said she, I love thee as affectionately, as if\r\nI were actually thy Bride: I love thee, as the Man, to whom I owe my\r\nLife, and what is dearer to me, the Preservation of my Honour. No\r\nHeart sure could be more deeply smitten than that of _Semira_. Never\r\ndid the Lips of the fairest Creature living utter softer Sounds;\r\nnever did the most enamoured Lady breathe such tender Sentiments of\r\nLove and Gratitude for his signal Service; never, in short, did the\r\nmost affectionate Bride express such Transports of Joy for the\r\nfondest Husband. Her Wounds, however, were but very superficial, and\r\nshe was soon recover'd. _Zadig_ receiv'd a Wound that was much more\r\ndangerous: An unlucky Arrow had graz'd one of his Eyes, and the\r\nOrifice was deep. _Semira_ was incessant in her Prayers to the Gods\r\nthat they might restore her _Zadig_. Her Eyes were Night and Day\r\noverwhelm'd with Tears. She waited with Impatience for the happy\r\nMoment, when those of _Zadig_ might dart their Fires upon her; but\r\nalas! the wounded Eye grew so inflam'd and swell'd, that she was\r\nterrified to the last Degree. She sent as far as _Memphis_ for\r\n_Hermes_, the celebrated Physician there, who instantly attended his\r\nnew Patient with a numerous Retinue. Upon his first Visit, he\r\nperemptorily declared that _Zadig_ would lose his Eye; and foretold\r\nnot only the Day, but the very Hour when that woful Disaster would\r\nbefal him. Had it been, said that Great Man, his right Eye, I could\r\nhave administred an infallible Specific; but as it is, his\r\nMisfortune is beyond the Art of Man to cure. Tho' all _Babylon_\r\npitied the hard Case of _Zadig_, they equally stood astonish'd at\r\nthe profound Penetration of _Hermes_. Two Days after the Imposthume\r\nbroke, without any Application, and _Zadig_ soon after was perfectly\r\nrecover'd. _Hermes_ thereupon wrote a very long and elaborate\r\nTreatise, to prove that his Wound ought not to have been heal'd.\r\n_Zadig_, however, never thought it worth his while to peruse his\r\nlearned Lucubrations; but, as soon as ever he could get abroad,\r\ndetermin'd to pay the Lady a Visit, who had testified such uncommon\r\nConcern for his Welfare, and for whose Sake alone he wish'd for the\r\nRestoration of his Sight. _Semira_ he found had been out of Town for\r\nthree Days; but was inform'd, by the bye, that his intended Spouse,\r\nhaving conceived an implacable Aversion to a one-ey'd Man, was that\r\nvery Night to be married to _Orcan_. At this unexpected ill News,\r\npoor _Zadig_ was perfectly thunder-struck: He laid his Disappointment\r\nso far to Heart, that in a short Time he was become a mere Skeleton,\r\nand was sick almost to death for some Months afterwards. At last,\r\nhowever, by Dint of Reflection, he got the better of his Distemper;\r\nand the Acuteness of the Pain he underwent, in some Measure,\r\ncontributed towards his Consolation.\r\n\r\nSince I have met with such an unexpected Repulse, said he, from a\r\ncapricious Court-Lady, I am determin'd to marry some substantial\r\nCitizen's Daughter. He pitch'd accordingly upon _Azora_, a young\r\nGentlewoman extremely well-bred, an excellent Oeconomist, and one,\r\nwhose Parents were very rich.\r\n\r\nTheir Nuptials accordingly were soon after solemniz'd, and for a\r\nwhole Month successively, no two Turtles were ever more fond of each\r\nother. In Process of Time, however, he perceiv'd she was a little\r\nCoquettish, and too much inclin'd to think, that the handsomest\r\nyoung Fellows were always the most virtuous and the greatest Wits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_The_ NOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Day _Azora_, as she was just return'd home from taking a short\r\nCountry airing, threw herself into a violent Passion, and swell'd\r\nwith Invectives. What, in God's Name, my Dear, said _Zadig_, has\r\nthus ruffled your Temper? What can be the Meaning of all these warm\r\nExclamations? Alas! said she, you would have been disgusted as much\r\nas I am, had you been an Eye-witness of that Scene of Female\r\nFalshood, as I was Yesterday. I went, you must know, to visit the\r\ndisconsolate Widow _Cosrou_, who has been these two Days erecting a\r\nMonument to the Memory of her young deceased Husband, near the Brook\r\nthat runs on one side of her Meadow. She made the most solemn Vow,\r\nin the Height of her Affliction, never to stir from that Tomb, as\r\nlong as ever that Rivulet took its usual Course.--Well! and wherein,\r\npray, said _Zadig_, is the good Woman so much to blame? Is it not an\r\nincontestable Mark of her superior Merit and Conjugal-Affection?\r\nBut, _Zadig_, said _Azora_, was you to know how her Thoughts were\r\nemploy'd when I made my Visit, you'd never forget or forgive her.\r\nPray, my dearest _Azora_, what then was she about? Why, the\r\nCreature, said _Azora_, was studying, to be sure, to find out Ways\r\nand Means to turn the Current of the River.\r\n\r\n_Azora_, in short, harangu'd so long, and, was so big with her\r\nInvectives against the young Widow, that her too affected, vain Shew\r\nof Virtue, gave _Zadig_ a secret Disgust.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ had an intimate Friend, one _Cador_ by Name, whose Spouse\r\nwas perfectly honest, and had in reality a greater Regard for him,\r\nthan all Mankind besides: This Friend _Zadig_ made his Confident,\r\nand bound him to keep a Project of his entirely a Secret, by a\r\nPromise of some valuable Token of his Respect. _Azora_ had been\r\nvisiting a Female Companion for two Days together in the Country,\r\nand on the third was returning home: No sooner, however, was she in\r\nSight of the House, but the Servants ran to meet her with Tears in\r\ntheir Eyes, and told her, that their Master dy'd suddenly the Night\r\nbefore; that they durstn't carry her the doleful Tidings, but were\r\ngoing to bury _Zadig_ in the Sepulchre of his Ancestors, at the\r\nBottom of the Garden. She burst into a Flood of Tears; tore her\r\nHair; and vow'd to die by his Side. As soon as it was dark, young\r\n_Cador_ came, and begg'd the Favour of being introduc'd to the\r\nWidow. He was so, and they wept together very cordially. Next Day\r\nthe Storm was somewhat abated, and they din'd together; _Cador_\r\ninform'd her, that his Friend had left him the much greater Part of\r\nhis Effects, and gave her to understand, that he should think\r\nhimself the happiest Creature in the World, if she would condescend\r\nto be his Partner in that Demise. The Widow wept, sobb'd, and began\r\nto melt. More Time was spent in Supper than at Dinner. They\r\ndiscoursed together with a little more Freedom. _Azora_ was lavish\r\nof her Encomiums on _Zadig_; but then, 'twas true, she said, he had\r\nsome secret Infirmities to which _Cador_ was a Stranger. In the\r\nMidst of their Midnight Entertainment, _Cador_ all on a sudden\r\ncomplain'd that he was taken with a most violent pleuretic Fit, and\r\nwas ready to swoon away. Our Lady being extremely concern'd, and\r\nover-officious, flew to her Closet of Cordials, and brought down\r\nevery Thing she could think of that might be of Service on this\r\nemergent Occasion. She was extremely sorry that the famous _Hermes_\r\nwas gone from _Babylon_, and condescended to lay her warm Hand upon\r\nthe Part affected, in which he felt such an agonizing Pain. Pray\r\nSir, said she, in a soft, languishing Tone, are you subject to this\r\ntormenting Malady? Sometimes, Madam, said _Cador_, so strong, that\r\nthey bring me almost to Death's Door; and there is but one Thing can\r\ninfallibly cure me; and that is, the Application of a dead Man's\r\nNose to the part affected. An odd Remedy truly, said _Azora_. Not\r\nstranger, Madam, said he, than the Great *_Arnon's_ infallible\r\nApoplectic Necklaces.\r\n\r\n    * There was at this Time in _Babylon_, a famous Doctor,\r\n      nam'd _Arnon_, who both cur'd Apoplectic Fits, and\r\n      prevented them from affecting his Patients, as was\r\n      frequently advertiz'd in the Gazettes, by a little\r\n      never-failing Purse that he hung round their Necks.\r\n\r\nThis Assurance of Success, together with _Cador's_ personal Merit,\r\ndetermin'd _Azora_ in his Favour. After all, said she, when my\r\nHusband shall be about to cross the Bridge _Tchimavar_, from this\r\nWorld of Yesterday, to the other, of To-morrow, will the Angel\r\n_Asrael_, think you, make any Scruple about his Passage, should his\r\nNose prove something shorter in the next Life than 'twas in this?\r\nShe would venture, however, and taking up a sharp Razor, repair'd to\r\nher Husband's Tomb; water'd it first with her Tears, and then\r\nintended to perform the innocent Operation, as he lay extended\r\nbreathless, as she thought, in his Coffin. _Zadig_ mounted in a\r\nMoment; secur'd his Nose with one Hand, and the Incision-Knife with\r\nthe other. Madam, said he, never more exclaim against the Widow\r\n_Cosrou_. The Scheme for cutting my Nose off was much closer laid\r\nthan hers of throwing the River into a new Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_The_ DOG _and the_ HORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ found, by Experience, that the first thirty Days of\r\nMatrimony (as 'tis written in the Book of _Zend_) is Honey-Moon; but\r\nthe second is all Wormwood. He was oblig'd, in short, as _Azora_\r\ngrew such a Termagant, to sue out a Bill of Divorce, and to seek his\r\nConsolation for the future, in the Study of Nature. Who is happier,\r\nsaid he, than the Philosopher, who peruses with Understanding that\r\nspacious Book, which the supreme Being has laid open before his\r\nEyes? The Truths he discovers there, are of infinite Service to him.\r\nHe thereby cultivates and improves his Mind. He lives in Peace and\r\nTranquility all his Days; he is afraid of Nobody, and he has no\r\ntender, indulgent Wife to shorten his Nose for him.\r\n\r\nWrapped up in these Contemplations, he retir'd to a little Country\r\nHouse on the Banks of the _Euphrates_; there he never spent his Time\r\nin calculating how many Inches of Water run thro' the Arch of a\r\nBridge in a second of Time, or in enquiring if a Cube Line of Rain\r\nfalls more in the _Mouse-Month_, than in that of the _Ram_. He\r\nform'd no Projects for making Silk Gloves and Stockings out of\r\nSpiders Webbs, nor of China-Ware out of broken Glass-Bottles; but he\r\npry'd into the Nature and Properties of Animals and Plants, and\r\nsoon, by his strict and repeated Enquiries, he was capable of\r\ndiscerning a Thousand Variations in visible Objects, that others,\r\nless curious, imagin'd were all alike.\r\n\r\nOne Day, as he was taking a solitary Walk by the Side of a Thicket,\r\nhe espy'd one of the Queen's Eunuchs, with several of his\r\nAttendants, coming towards him, hunting about, in deep Concern, both\r\nhere and there, like Persons almost in Despair, and seeking, with\r\nImpatience, for something lost of the utmost Importance. Young Man,\r\nsaid the Queen's chief Eunuch, have not you seen, pray, her\r\nMajesty's Dog? _Zadig_ very cooly replied, you mean her Bitch, I\r\npresume. You say very right Sir, said the Eunuch, 'tis a\r\nSpaniel-Bitch indeed.--And very small said _Zadig_: She has had\r\nPuppies too lately; she's a little lame with her left Fore-foot, and\r\nhas long Ears. By your exact Description, Sir, you must doubtless\r\nhave seen her, said the Eunuch, almost out of Breath. But I have not\r\nSir, notwithstanding, neither did I know, but by you, that the Queen\r\never had such a favourite Bitch.\r\n\r\nJust at this critical Juncture, so various are the Turns of\r\nFortune's Wheel! the best Palfrey in all the King's Stable had broke\r\nloose from the Groom, and got upon the Plains of _Babylon_. The Head\r\nHuntsman with all his inferior Officers, were in Pursuit after him,\r\nwith as much Concern, as the Eunuch about the Bitch. The Head\r\nHuntsman address'd himself to _Zadig_, and ask'd him, whether he\r\nhadn't seen the King's Palfrey run by him. No Horse, said _Zadig_,\r\never gallop'd smoother; he is about five Foot high, his Hoofs are\r\nvery small; his Tail is about three Foot six Inches long; the studs\r\nof his Bit are of pure Gold, about 23 Carats; and his Shoes are of\r\nSilver, about Eleven penny Weight a-piece. What Course did he take,\r\npray, Sir? Whereabouts is he, said the Huntsman? I never sat Eyes on\r\nhim, reply'd _Zadig_, not I, neither did I ever hear before now,\r\nthat his Majesty had such a Palfrey.\r\n\r\nThe Head Huntsman, as well as the Head Eunuch, upon his answering\r\ntheir Interrogatories so very exactly, not doubting in the least,\r\nbut that _Zadig_ had clandestinely convey'd both the Bitch and the\r\nHorse away, secur'd him, and carried him before the grand Desterham,\r\nwho condemn'd him to the _Knout_, and to be confin'd for Life in\r\nsome remote and lonely Part of _Siberia_. No sooner had the Sentence\r\nbeen pronounc'd, but the Horse and Bitch were both found. The Judges\r\nwere in some Perplexity in this odd Affair, and yet thought it\r\nabsolutely necessary, as the Man was innocent, to recal their\r\nDecree. However, they laid a Fine upon him of Four Hundred Ounces of\r\nGold, for his false Declaration of his not having seen, what\r\ndoubtless he did: And the Fine was order'd to be deposited in Court\r\naccordingly: On the Payment whereof, he was permitted to bring his\r\nCause on to a Hearing before the grand Desterham.\r\n\r\nOn the Day appointed for that Purpose he open'd the Cause himself,\r\nin Terms to this or the like Effect.\r\n\r\nYe bright Stars of Justice, ye profound Abyss of universal\r\nKnowledge, ye Mirrors of Equity, who have in you the Solidity of\r\nLead, the Hardness of Steel, the Lustre of a Diamond, and the\r\nResemblance of the purest Gold! Since ye have condescended so far,\r\nas to admit of my Address to this August Assembly, I here, in the\r\nmost solemn Manner, swear to you by _Orosmades_, that I never saw\r\nthe Queen's illustrious Bitch, nor the sacred Palfrey of the King of\r\nKings. I'll be ingenuous, however, and declare the Truth, and\r\nnothing but the Truth. As I was walking by the Thicket's Side, where\r\nI met with her Majesty's most venerable chief Eunuch, and the King's\r\nmost illustrious chief Huntsman, I perceiv'd upon the Sand the\r\nFootsteps of an Animal, and I easily inferr'd that it must be a\r\nlittle one. The several small, tho' long Ridges of Land between the\r\nFootsteps of the Creature, gave me just Grounds to imagine it was a\r\nBitch whose Teats hung down; and for that Reason, I concluded she\r\nhad but lately pupp'd. As I observ'd likewise some other Traces, in\r\nsome Degree different, which seem'd to have graz'd all the Way upon\r\nthe Surface of the Sand, on the Side of the fore-Feet, I knew well\r\nenough she must have had long Ears. And forasmuch as I discern'd;\r\nwith some Degree of Curiosity, that the Sand was every where less\r\nhollow'd by one Foot in particular, than by the other three, I\r\nconceiv'd that the Bitch of our most august Queen was somewhat\r\nlamish, if I may presume to say so.\r\n\r\nAs to the Palfrey of the King of Kings, give me leave to inform you,\r\nthat as I was walking down the Lane by the Thicket-side, I took\r\nparticular Notice of the Prints made upon the Sand by a Horse's\r\nShoes; and found that their Distances were in exact Proportion; from\r\nthat Observation, I concluded the Palfrey gallop'd well. In the next\r\nPlace, the Dust of some Trees in a narrow Lane, which was but seven\r\nFoot broad, was here and there swept off, both on the Right and on\r\nthe Left, about three Feet and six Inches from the Middle of the\r\nRoad. For which Reason I pronounc'd the Tail of the Palfrey to be\r\nthree Foot and a half long, with which he had whisk'd off the Dust\r\non both Sides as he ran along. Again, I perceiv'd under the Trees,\r\nwhich form'd a Kind of Bower of five Feet high, some Leaves that had\r\nbeen lately fallen on the Ground, and I was sensible the Horse must\r\nhave shook them off; from whence I conjectur'd he was five Foot\r\nhigh. As to the Bits of his Bridle, I knew they must be of Gold, and\r\nof the Value I mention'd; for he had rubb'd the Studs upon a certain\r\nStone, which I knew to be a Touch-stone, by an Experiment that I had\r\nmade of it. To conclude, by the Prints which his Shoes had left of\r\nsome Flint-Stones of another Nature, I concluded his Shoes were\r\nSilver, and of eleven penny Weight Fineness, as I before mention'd.\r\n\r\nThe whole Bench of Judges stood astonish'd at the Profundity of\r\n_Zadig's_ nice Discernment. The News was soon carried to the King\r\nand the Queen. _Zadig_ was not only the whole Subject of the Court's\r\nConversation; but his Name was mention'd with the utmost Veneration\r\nin the King's Chambers, and his Privy-Council. And notwithstanding\r\nseveral of their Magi declar'd he ought to be burnt for a Sorcerer;\r\nyet the King thought proper, that the Fine he had deposited in\r\nCourt, should be peremptorily restor'd. The Clerk of the Court, the\r\nTipstaffs, and other petty Officers, waited on him in their proper\r\nHabit, in order to refund the four Hundred Ounces of Gold, pursuant\r\nto the King's express Order; modestly reserving only three Hundred\r\nand ninety Ounces, part thereof, to defray the Fees of the Court.\r\nAnd the Domesticks swarm'd about him likewise, in Hopes of some\r\nsmall Consideration.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_, upon winding up of the Bottom, was fully convinc'd, that it\r\nwas very dangerous to be over-wise; and was determin'd to set a\r\nWatch before the Door of his Lips for the future.\r\n\r\nAn Opportunity soon offer'd for the Trial of his Resolution. A\r\nPrisoner of State had just made his Escape, and pass'd under the\r\nWindow of _Zadig's_ House. _Zadig_ was examin'd thereupon, but was\r\nabsolutely dumb. However, as it was plainly prov'd upon him, that he\r\ndid look out of the Window at the same Time, he was sentenc'd to pay\r\nfive Hundred Ounces of Gold for that Misdemeanor; and moreover, was\r\noblig'd to thank the Court for their Indulgence; a Compliment which\r\nthe Magistrates of _Babylon_ expect to be paid them. Good God! said\r\nhe, to himself, have I not substantial Reason to complain, that my\r\nimpropitious Stars should direct me to walk by a Wood's-Side, where\r\nthe Queen's Bitch and the King's Palfrey should happen to pass by?\r\nHow dangerous is it to pop one's Head out of one's Window? And, in a\r\nWord, how difficult is it for a Man to be happy on this Side the\r\nGrave?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n_The_ ENVIOUS MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs _Zadig_ had met with such a Series of Misfortunes, he was\r\ndetermin'd to ease the Weight of them by the Study of Philosophy,\r\nand the Conversation of select Friends. He was still possess'd of a\r\nlittle pretty Box in the Out-parts of _Babylon_, which was furnish'd\r\nin a good Taste; where every Artist was welcome, and wherein he\r\nenjoy'd all the rational Pleasures that a virtuous Man could well\r\nwish for. In the Morning, his Library was always open for the Use of\r\nthe Learned; at Night his Table was fill'd with the most agreeable\r\nCompanions; but he was soon sensible, by Experience, how dangerous\r\nit was to keep learned Men Company. A warm Dispute arose about a\r\ncertain Law of _Zoroaster_; which prohibited the Eating of Griffins:\r\nBut to what Purpose said some of the Company, was that Prohibition,\r\nsince there is no such Animal in Nature? Some again insisted that\r\nthere must; for otherwise _Zoroaster_ could never have been so weak\r\nas to give his Pupils such a Caution. _Zadig_, in order to\r\ncompromize the Matter, said; Gentlemen, If there are such Creatures\r\nin Being, let us never touch them; and if there are not, we are well\r\nassur'd we can't touch them; so in either Case we shall comply with\r\nthe Commandment.\r\n\r\nA learned Man at the upper End of the Table, who had compos'd\r\nthirteen Volumes, expatiating on every Property of the Griffin, took\r\nthis Affair in a very serious Light, which would greatly have\r\nembarrass'd _Zadig_, but for the Credit of a Magus, who was Brother\r\nto his Friend _Cador_. From that Day forward, _Zadig_ ever\r\ndistinguish'd and preferr'd good, before learned Company: He\r\nassociated with the most conversible Men, and the most amiable\r\nLadies in all _Babylon_; he made elegant Entertainments, which were\r\nfrequently preceded by a Concert of Musick, and enliven'd by the\r\nmost facetious Conversation, in which, as he had felt the Smart of\r\nit, he had laid aside all Thoughts of shewing his Wit, which is not\r\nonly the surest Proof that a Man has none, but the most infallible\r\nMeans to spoil all good Company.\r\n\r\nNeither the Choice of his Friends, nor that of his Dishes, was the\r\nResult of Pride or Ostentation. He took Delight in appearing to be,\r\nwhat he actually was, and not in seeming to be what he was not; and\r\nby that Means, got a greater real Character than he actually aim'd\r\nat.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposite to his House liv'd _Arimazes_, one puff'd up with\r\nPride, who not meeting with Success in the World, sought his Revenge\r\nin railing against all Mankind. Rich as he was, it was almost more\r\nthan he could accomplish, to procure ev'n any Parasites about him.\r\nTho' the rattling of the Chariots which stopp'd at _Zadig's_ Door\r\nwas a perfect Nuisance to him; yet the good Character which every\r\nBody gave him was still a higher Provocation. He would sometimes\r\nintrude himself upon _Zadig_, and set down at his Table without any\r\nInvitation; when there, he would most certainly interrupt the Mirth\r\nof the Company, as Harpies, they say, infect the very Carrion that\r\nthey eat.\r\n\r\n_Arimazes_ took it in his Head one Day to invite a young Lady to an\r\nEntertainment; but she, instead of accepting of his Offer, spent the\r\nEvening at _Zadig's_. Another Time, as _Zadig_ and he were chatting\r\ntogether at Court, a Minister of State came up to them, and invited\r\n_Zadig_ to Supper, but took no Notice of _Arimazes_. The most\r\nimplacable Aversions have frequently no better Foundations. This\r\nGentleman, who was call'd the _envious Man_, would have taken away\r\nthe Life of _Zadig_ if he could because most People distinguish'd\r\nhim by the Title of the _Happy Man_. \"An Opportunity of doing\r\nMischief, says _Zoroaster_, offers itself a hundred Times a Day; but\r\nthat of doing a Friend a good Office but once a Year.\"\r\n\r\n_Arimazes_ went one Day to _Zadig's_ House, when he was walking in\r\nhis Garden with two Friends, and a young Lady, to whom he said\r\nAbundance of fine Things, with no other Design but the innocent\r\nPleasure of saying them. Their Conversation turn'd on a War that the\r\nKing had happily put an End to, between him and his Vassal, the\r\nPrince of _Hyrcania_. _Zadig_ having signaliz'd himself in that\r\nshort War, commended his Majesty very highly, but was more lavish of\r\nhis Compliments on the Lady. He took out his Pocket Book, and wrote\r\nfour extempore Verses on that Occasion, and gave them the Lady to\r\nread. The Gentlemen then present begg'd to be oblig'd with a Sight\r\nof them, as well as the Lady, But either thro' Modesty, or rather a\r\nself-Consciousness that he hadn't happily succeeded, he gave them a\r\nflat Denial. He was sensible, that a sudden poetic Flight must prove\r\ninsipid to every one but the Person in whose Favour it is written,\r\nwhereupon he snapt the Table in two whereon the Lines were wrote,\r\nand threw both Pieces into a Rose-bush, where they were hunted for,\r\nbut to no Purpose. Soon after it happened to rain, and all the\r\nCompany flew into the House, but _Arimazes_. Notwithstanding the\r\nShower, he continued in the Garden, and never quitted it, till he\r\nhad found one Moiety of the Tablet, which was unfortunately broke in\r\nsuch a Manner, that even the half Lines were good sense, and good\r\nMetre, tho' very short. But what was still more remarkably\r\nunfortunate, they appear'd at first View, to be a severe satyr upon\r\nthe King: The Words were these:\r\n\r\n                                        _To flagrant Crimes\r\n                                             His Crown he owes;\r\n                                         To peaceful Times\r\n                                             The worst of Foes._\r\n\r\nThis was the first Moment that ever _Arimazes_ was happy. He had it\r\nnow in his Power to ruin the most virtuous and innocent of Men. Big\r\nwith his execrable Joy, he flew to his Majesty with this virulent\r\nSatyr of _Zadig's_ under his own Hand. Not only _Zadig_, but his two\r\nFriends and the Lady were immediately close confin'd. His Cause was\r\nsoon over; for the Judges turn'd a deaf Ear to what he had to say.\r\nWhen Sentence of Condemnation was pass'd upon him, _Arimazes_, still\r\nspiteful, was heard to say, as he went out of Court, with an Air of\r\nContempt, that _Zadig's_ Lines were Treason indeed, but nothing\r\nmore. Tho' _Zadig_ didn't value himself on Account of his Genius for\r\nPoetry; yet he was almost distracted to find himself condemn'd for\r\nthe worst of Traitors, and his two Friends and the Lady lock'd up in\r\na Dungeon for a Crime, of which he was no ways guilty. He wasn't\r\npermitted to speak one Word for himself. His Pocket-Book was\r\nsufficient Evidence against him. So strict were the Laws of\r\n_Babylon_! He was carried to the Place of Execution, through a Croud\r\nof Spectators, who durstn't condole with him, and who flock'd about\r\nhim, to observe whether his Countenance chang'd, or whether he died\r\nwith a good Grace. His Relations were the only real Mourners; for\r\nthere was no Estate in Reversion for them; three Parts of his\r\nEffects were confiscated for the King's Use, and the fourth was\r\ndevoted, as a Reward, to the use of the Informer.\r\n\r\nJust at the Time that he was preparing himself for Death, the King's\r\nParrot flew from her Balcony, into _Zadig's_ Garden, and alighted on\r\na Rose-bush. A Peach, that had been blown down, and drove by the\r\nWind from an adjacent Tree, just under the Bush, was glew'd, as it\r\nwere, to the other Moiety of the Tablet. Away flew the Parrot with\r\nher Booty, and return'd to the King's Lap. The Monarch, being\r\nsomewhat curious, read the Words on the broken Tablet, which had no\r\nMeaning in them as he could perceive, but seem'd to be the broken\r\nParts of a Tetrastick. He was a great Admirer of Poetry; and the odd\r\nAdventure of his Parrot, put him upon Reflection. The Queen who\r\nrecollected full well the Lines that were wrote on the Fragment of\r\n_Zadig's_ Tablet, order'd that Part of it to be produc'd: Both the\r\nbroken Pieces being put together, they answered exactly the\r\nIndentures; and then the Verses which _Zadig_ had written, in a\r\nFlight of Loyalty, ran thus,\r\n\r\n    _Tyrants are prone to flagrant Crimes;\r\n       To Clemency his Crown he owes;\r\n     To Concord and to peaceful Times,\r\n       Love only is the worst of Foes._\r\n\r\nUpon this the King order'd _Zadig_ to be instantly brought before\r\nhim; and his two Friends and the Lady to be that Moment discharg'd.\r\n_Zadig_, as he stood before the King and Queen, fix'd his Eyes upon\r\nthe Ground, and begg'd their Majesty's Pardon for his little\r\nworthless, poetical Attempt. He spoke, however, with such a becoming\r\nGrace, and with so much Modesty and good Sense, that the King and\r\nthe Queen, ordered him to be brought before them once again. He was\r\nbrought accordingly, and he pleas'd them still more and more. In\r\nshort, they gave him all the immense Estate of _Arimazes_, who had\r\nso unjustly accus'd him; but _Zadig_ generously return'd the wicked\r\nInformer the Whole to a Farthing. The envious Man, however, was no\r\nways affected, but with the Restoration of his Effects. _Zadig_\r\nevery Day grew more and more in Favour at Court. He was made a Party\r\nin all the King's Pleasures, and nothing was done in the\r\nPrivy-Council without him. The Queen, from that very Hour, shew'd\r\nhim so much Respect, and spoke to him in such soft and endearing\r\nTerms, that in Process of Time, it prov'd of fatal Consequence to\r\nherself, her Royal Consort, to _Zadig_, and the whole Kingdom.\r\n_Zadig_ now began to think it was not so difficult a Thing to be\r\nhappy as at first he imagin'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_The_ Force _of_ Generosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Time now drew near for the Celebration of a grand Festival,\r\nwhich was kept but once in five Years. 'Twas a constant Custom in\r\n_Babylon_ at the Expiration of the Term above-mention'd, to\r\ndistinguish that Citizen from all the Rest, in the most solemn\r\nManner, who had done the most generous Action; and the Grandees and\r\nMagi always sat as Judges. The _Satrap_ inform'd them of every\r\npraise-worthy Deed that occurr'd within his District. All were put\r\nto the Vote, and the King himself pronounc'd the Definitive\r\nSentence. People of all Ranks and Degrees came from the remotest\r\nPart of the Kingdom to be present at this Solemnity. The Victor,\r\nwhoever he was, receiv'd from the King's own Hand a golden Cup,\r\nenrich'd with precious Stones, and upon the Delivery, the King made\r\nuse of the following Salutation. _Receive this Reward of your\r\nGenerosity, and may the Gods grant me Thousands of such valuable\r\nSubjects!_\r\n\r\nUpon this memorable Day, the King appear'd in all the Pomp\r\nimaginable on his Throne of State, surrounded by his Grandees, the\r\nMagi, and the Deputies, from all the surrounding Nations, of every\r\nProvince that attended these public Sports, where Honour was to be\r\nacquir'd, not by the Velocity of the best Race-Horse, or by bodily\r\nStrength, but by intrinsic Merit. The principal _Satrap_ proclaim'd,\r\nwith an audible Voice, such Actions as would entitle the Victor to\r\nthe inestimable Prize; but never mention'd one Word of _Zadig's_\r\nGreatness of Soul, in returning his invidious Neighbour all his\r\nEstate, notwithstanding he would have taken away his Life: That was\r\nbut a Trifle, and not worth speaking of.\r\n\r\nThe first that was set up for the Prize, was a Judge, that had\r\noccasion'd a Citizen to lose a very considerable Cause, through some\r\nMistake, for which he was no ways responsible, and made him\r\nRestitution out of his private Purse.\r\n\r\nThe next Candidate was a Youth, that tho' violently in Love with one\r\nthat he intended shortly to make his Spouse, yet resign'd her to his\r\nFriend, who was just expiring at her Feet; and moreover, gave her a\r\nPortion at the same Time.\r\n\r\nAfter this appear'd a Soldier, who, in the _Hyrcanian_ War, had done\r\na much more glorious Action than the Lover. A Gang of _Hyrcanians_\r\nhaving taken his Mistress from him, he fought them bravely, and\r\nrescued her out of their Hands: Soon after, he was inform'd, that\r\nanother Band of the same Party had hurried away his Mother to a\r\nPlace not far distant; he left his Mistress, all drown'd in Tears,\r\nand ran to his Mother's Assistance: After that Skirmish was over, he\r\nreturned to his Sweet-heart, and found her just expiring. He would\r\nfain have plung'd a Dagger into his Heart that Moment; but his\r\nMother remonstrated to him, that, should he die, she should be\r\nentirely helpless, and upon that Account only he had Courage to live\r\na little longer.\r\n\r\nThe Judges seem'd very much inclin'd to give their Votes for the\r\nSoldier; but the King prevented them, by saying, that the Soldier's\r\nAction was praise-worthy enough, and so were those of the rest, but\r\nnone of them give me any Surprize. What _Zadig_ did Yesterday\r\nperfectly struck me with Astonishment. I'll mention another\r\nInstance. I had some few Days ago, as a Testimony of my Resentment,\r\nbanish'd my Prime-Minister, and Favourite _Coreb_ from the Court. I\r\ncomplain'd of his Conduct in the warmest Terms; and all my\r\nSycophants about me, told me that I was too merciful; and loaded him\r\nwith the sharpest Invectives. I ask'd _Zadig_ what his Opinion was\r\nof _Coreb_; and he dar'd to give him the best of Characters. I must\r\nconfess, I have read in our publick Records, indeed, of Instances\r\nwhere Restitution have been generally made, for Injuries committed\r\nby Mistake; where a Mistress has been resign'd; and where a Mother\r\nhas been preferr'd to a Mistress; but I never read of a Courtier,\r\nthat would speak to the Advantage of a Minister in Disgrace, and\r\nagainst whom the Sovereign was highly incens'd. I'll give 20,000\r\nPieces of Gold to every Candidate that has been this Day proclaim'd,\r\nbut I'll give the Cup to no one but _Zadig_.\r\n\r\nSire, said _Zadig_, 'tis your Majesty alone, that deserves the Cup;\r\n'tis you alone who have done an Action of Generosity, never heard of\r\nbefore; since you, who are King of Kings, wasn't exasperated against\r\nyour Slave, when he contradicted you in the Heat of your Passion.\r\nEvery Body gaz'd with Eyes of Admiration on the King and _Zadig_.\r\nThe Judge, who had generously made Restitution for his Error; the\r\nLover, who had married his Mistress to his Friend; the Soldier, who\r\nhad preferr'd the Welfare of his Mother to that of his Mistress;\r\nreceived the promis'd Donation from the Monarch, and saw their Names\r\nregister'd in the Book of _Fame_: But _Zadig_ had the Cup. The King\r\ngot the universal Character of a good Prince, which he did not long\r\npreserve. This joyful Day was solemniz'd with Festivals beyond the\r\nTime by Law establish'd. Tragedies were acted there that drew Tears\r\nfrom the Spectators; and Comedies that made them laugh; Entertainments,\r\nthat the _Babylonians_ were perfect Strangers to: The Commemoration\r\nof it is still preserv'd in _Asia_. Now, said _Zadig_, I am happy at\r\nlast; but he was grosly mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP VI.\r\n\r\n_The_ JUDGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung as _Zadig_ was, he was constituted chief Judge of all the\r\nTribunals throughout the Empire. He fill'd the Place, like one, whom\r\nthe Gods had endow'd with the strictest Justice, and the most solid\r\nWisdom. It was to him, the Nations round about were indebted for\r\nthat generous Maxim; _that 'tis much more Prudence to acquit two\r\nPersons, tho' actually guilty, than to pass Sentence of Condemnation\r\nin one that is virtuous and innocent_. It was his firm Opinion, that\r\nthe Laws were intended to be a Praise to those who did well, as much\r\nas to be a Terror to Evildoers. It was his peculiar Talent to render\r\nTruth as obvious as possible: Whereas most Men study to render it\r\nintricate and obscure. On the very first Day of his Entrance into\r\nhis High Office, he exerted this peculiar Talent. A rich Merchant,\r\nand a Native of _Babylon_, died in the _Indies_. He had made his\r\nWill, and appointed his two Sons Joint-Heirs of his Estate, as soon\r\nas they had settled their Sister, and married her with their mutual\r\nApprobation. Moreover, he left a specific Legacy of 30,000 Pieces of\r\nGold to that Son, who should, after his Decease, be prov'd to love\r\nhim best. The Eldest erected to his Memory a very costly Monument:\r\nThe Youngest appropriated a considerable Part of his Bequest to the\r\nAugmentation of his Sister's Fortune: Every one, without Hesitation,\r\ngave the Preference to the Elder, allowing the Younger to have the\r\ngreatest Affection for his Sister. The Legacy therefore was\r\ndoubtless due to the Eldest.\r\n\r\nTheir Cause came before _Zadig_, and he examin'd them apart. To the\r\nformer, said _Zadig_, Your Father, Sir, is not dead, as is reported,\r\nbut being happily recover'd, is on his Return to _Babylon_. God be\r\npraised, said the young Man! but I hope the Expence I have been at\r\nin raising this superb Monument will be consider'd. After this,\r\n_Zadig_ repeated the same Story to the Younger. God be praised, said\r\nhe! I will immediately restore all that he has left me; but I hope\r\nmy Father will not recal the little Present I have made my Sister.\r\nYou have nothing to restore, Sir; you shall have the Legacy of the\r\nthirty thousand Pieces; for 'tis you that have the greatest\r\nVeneration for your deceased Father.\r\n\r\nA young Lady that was very rich, had entred into a Marriage-Contract\r\nwith two _Magis_; and having receiv'd Instructions from both Parties\r\nfor some Months, she prov'd with Child. They were both ready and\r\nwilling to marry her. But, said she, he shall be my Husband, that\r\nhas put me into a Capacity of serving my Country, by adding one to\r\nit. 'Tis I, Madam, that have answered that valuable End, said one;\r\nbut the other insisted 'twas his Operation. Well! said she, since\r\nthis is a Moot-point, I'll acknowledge him for the Father of the\r\nChild, that will give him the most liberal Education. In a short\r\nTime after, my Lady was brought to Bed of a hopeful Boy. Each of\r\nthem insisted on being Tutor, and the Cause was brought before\r\n_Zadig_. The two Magi were order'd to appear in Court. Pray Sir,\r\nsaid _Zadig_ to the first, what Method of Instruction do you propose\r\nto pursue for the Improvement of your young Pupil? He shall first be\r\ngrounded, said this learned Pedagogue, in the Eight Parts of Speech;\r\nthen I'll teach him Logic, Astrology, Magick, the wide Difference\r\nbetween the Terms Substance and Accident, Abstract and Concrete,\r\n_&c. &c._ As for my Part, Sir, I shall take another Course, said the\r\nsecond; I'll do my utmost to make him an honest Man, and acceptable\r\nto his Friends. Upon this, _Zadig_ said, you, Sir, shall marry the\r\nMother, let who will be the Father.\r\n\r\nThere came daily Complaints to Court against the _Itimadoulet_ of\r\n_Media_, whose Name was _Irax_. He was a Person of Quality, who was\r\npossess'd of a very considerable Estate, notwithstanding he had\r\nsquander'd away a great Part of it, by indulging himself in all\r\nManner of expensive Pleasures. It was but seldom that an Inferior\r\nwas suffer'd to speak to him; but not a Soul durst contradict him:\r\nNo Peacock was more gay; no Turtle more amorous; and no Tortoise\r\nmore indolent and inactive. He made false Glory and false Pleasures\r\nhis sole Pursuit.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_, undertaking to cure him, sent him forthwith, as by express\r\nOrder from the King, a Musick-Master with twelve Voices, and 24\r\nViolins, as his Attendants; a Head Steward, with six Men Cooks, and\r\n4 Chamberlains, who were never to be out of his Sight. The King\r\nissued out his Writ for the punctual Observance of his Royal Will;\r\nand thus the Affair proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe first Morning, as soon as the voluptuous _Irax_ had open'd his\r\nEyes, his Musick-Master, with the Voices and Violins, entred his\r\nApartment. They sang a Cantata, that lasted two Hours and three\r\nMinutes. Every three Minutes the Chorus, or Burthen of the Song, was\r\nto this Effect.\r\n\r\n    _Tisn't in Words to speak your Praise;\r\n      What mighty Honours are your Due!\r\n     To worth like yours we Altars raise,\r\n      No Monarch's happier, Sir, than you._\r\n\r\nAfter the Cantata was over, the Chamberlain address'd him in a\r\nformal Harangue for three Quarters of an Hour without ceasing;\r\nwherein he took Occasion to extol every Virtue to which he was a\r\nperfect Stranger; when the Oration was over, he was conducted to\r\nDinner, where the Musicians were all in waiting, and play'd, as soon\r\nas he was seated at his Table. Dinner lasted three Hours before he\r\ncondescended to speak a Word. When he did; you say Right, Sir, said\r\nthe chief Chamberlain; scarce had he utter'd four Words more, but\r\nRight, Sir, said the second. The other two Chamberlain's Time was\r\ntaken up in laughing with Admiration at _Irax's_ Smart Repartees, or\r\nat least such as he ought to have made. After the Cloth was taken\r\naway, the adulating Chorus was repeated.\r\n\r\nThis first Day _Irax_ was all in Raptures; he imagin'd, that this\r\nHonour done him by the King of Kings, was the sole Result of his\r\nexalted Merit. The second wasn't altogether so agreeable; The third\r\nprov'd somewhat troublesome; the fourth insupportable; the fifth was\r\ntormenting; and at last, he was perfectly outrageous at the\r\ncontinual Peal in his Ears of No Monarch's happier Sir, than you,\r\nYou say right, _&c._ and at being daily harangu'd at the same Hour.\r\nWhereupon he wrote to Court, and begg'd of his Majesty to recal his\r\nChamberlain, his Musick-Master, and all his Retinue, his Head\r\nSteward and his Cooks, and promis'd, in the most submissive Manner,\r\nto be less vain, and more industrious for the future. Tho' he didn't\r\nrequire so much Adulations, nor such grand Entertainments, he was\r\nmuch more happy; for, as _Sadder_ has it, _One continued Scene of\r\nPleasure, is no Pleasure at all_.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ every Day gave incontestable Proofs of his wondrous\r\nPenetration, and the Goodness of his Heart; he was ador'd by the\r\nPeople, and was the Darling of the King. The little Difficulties\r\nthat he met with in the first Stage of his Life, serv'd only to\r\naugment his present Felicity. Every Night, however, he had some\r\nunlucky Dream or another, that gave him some Disturbance. One while,\r\nhe imagin'd himself extended on a Bed of wither'd Plants, amongst\r\nwhich there were some that were sharp pointed, and made him very\r\nrestless and uneasy; another Time, he fancied himself repos'd on a\r\nBed of Roses, out of which rush'd a Serpent, that stung him to the\r\nHeart with his envenom'd Tongue. Alas! said he, waking, I was one\r\nwhile upon a Bed of hard and nauseous Plants, and just this Moment\r\nrepos'd on a Bed of Roses. But then the Serpent.--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_The Force of_ JEALOUSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Misfortunes that attended _Zadig_ proceeded, in a great Measure,\r\nfrom his Preferment; but more from his intrinsic Merit. Every Day he\r\nhad familiar Converse with the King, his Royal Master, and his\r\naugust Consort, _Astarte_. And the Pleasure arising from thence was\r\ngreatly enhanc'd from an innate Ambition of pleasing, which, in\r\nregard to Wit, is the same, as Dress is to Beauty. His Youth, and\r\ngraceful Deportment, had a greater Influence on _Astarte_, than she\r\nwas at first aware of. Tho' her Affection for him daily encreas'd;\r\nyet she was perfectly innocent. _Astarte_ would say, without the\r\nleast Reserve or Apprehension of Fear, that she was extreamly\r\npleas'd with the Company of one, who was, not only a Favourite of\r\nher Husband, but the Darling of the whole Empire. She was\r\ncontinually speaking in his Commendation before the King: He was the\r\nSubject of her whole Discourse amongst her Ladies of Honour, who\r\nwere as lavish of their Praises as herself. Such repeated\r\nDiscourses, however innocent, made a deeper Impression on her Heart,\r\nthan she at that Time apprehended. She would every now and then send\r\n_Zadig_ some little Present or another; which he construed as the\r\nResult of a greater Value for him than she intended. She said no\r\nmore of him, as she thought, than a Queen might innocently do, who\r\nwas perfectly assur'd of his Attachment to her Husband; sometimes,\r\nindeed, she would express her self with an Air of Tenderness and\r\nAffection.\r\n\r\n_Astarte_ was much handsomer than either his Mistress _Semira_, who\r\nhad such a natural Antipathy to a one-eyed Lord, or _Azora_, his\r\nlate loving Spouse, that would innocently have cut his Nose off. The\r\nFreedoms which _Astarte_ took, her tender Expressions, at which she\r\nbegan to blush, the Glances of her Eye, which she would turn away,\r\nif perceiv'd, and which she fix'd upon his, kindled in the Heart of\r\n_Zadig_ a Fire, which struck him with Amazement. He did all he could\r\nto smother it; he call'd up all the Philosophy he was Master of to\r\nhis Aid; but all in vain, for no Consolation arose from those\r\nReflections.\r\n\r\nDuty, Gratitude, and an injur'd Monarch, presented themselves before\r\nhis Eyes, as avenging Deities: He bravely struggled; he triumph'd\r\nindeed; but this Conquest over his Passions, which he was oblig'd to\r\ncheck every Moment, cost him many a deep Sigh and Tear. He durst not\r\ntalk with the Queen any more, with that Freedom which was too\r\nengaging on both Sides; his Eyes were obnubilated; his Discourse was\r\nforc'd and unconnected; he turn'd his Eyes another Way; and when,\r\nagainst his Inclination, they met with those of the Queen, he found,\r\nthat tho' drown'd in Tears, they darted Flames of Fire: They seem'd\r\nin Silence to intimate, that they were afraid of being in love with\r\neach other; and that both burn'd with a Fire which both condemn'd.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ flew from her Presence, like one beside himself, and in\r\nDespair; his Heart was over-charg'd with a Burthen, too great for\r\nhim to bear: In the Heat of his Conflicts, he disclos'd the Secrets\r\nof his Heart to his trusty Friend _Cador_, as one, who, having long\r\ngroan'd under the Weight of an inexpressible Anguish of Mind, at\r\nonce makes known the Cause of his Torments by the Groans, as it\r\nwere, extorted from him, and by the Drops of a cold Sweat, that\r\ntrickled down his Cheeks.\r\n\r\n_Cador_ said to him; 'tis now some considerable Time since, I have\r\ndiscover'd that secret Passion which you have foster'd in your\r\nBosom, and yet endeavour'd to conceal even from your self. The\r\nPassions carry along with them such strong Impressions, that they\r\ncannot be conceal'd. Tell me ingenuously _Zadig_; and be your own\r\nAccuser, whether or no, since I have made this Discovery, the King\r\nhas not shewn some visible Marks of his Resentment. He has no other\r\nFoible, but that of being the most jealous Mortal breathing. You\r\ntake more Pains to check the Violence of your Passion, than the\r\nQueen herself does; because you are a Philosopher; because, in\r\nshort, you are _Zadig_; _Astarte_ is but a weak Woman; and tho' her\r\nEyes speak too visibly, and with too much Imprudence; yet she does\r\nnot think her self blame-worthy. Being conscious of her Innocence,\r\nto her own Misfortune, as well as yours, she is too unguarded. I\r\ntremble for her; because I am sensible her Conscience acquits her.\r\nWere you both agreed, you might conceal your Regard for each other\r\nfrom all the World: A rising Passion, that is smother'd, breaks out\r\ninto a Flame; Love, when once gratified, knows how to conceal itself\r\nwith Art. _Zadig_ shudder'd at the Proposition of ungratefully\r\nviolating the Bed of his Royal Benefactor; and never was there a\r\nmore loyal Subject to a Prince, tho' guilty of an involuntary Crime.\r\nThe Queen, however, repeated the Name of _Zadig_ so often, and her\r\nCheeks glow'd with such a red, when ever she utter'd it; she was one\r\nwhile so transported, and at another, so dejected, when the\r\nDiscourse turn'd upon him in the King's Presence; she was in such a\r\nReverie, so confus'd and stupid, when he went out of the Presence,\r\nthat her Deportment made the King extremely uneasy. He was convinc'd\r\nof every Thing he saw, and form'd in his Mind an Idea of a thousand\r\nThings he did not see. He observ'd, particularly, that _Astarte's_\r\nSandals were blue; so _Zadig's_ were blue likewise; that as the\r\nQueen wore yellow Ribbands, _Zadig's_ Turbet was of the same Colour:\r\nThese were shocking Circumstances for a Monarch of his Cast of Mind\r\nto reflect on! To a Mind, in short, so distemper'd as his was,\r\nSuspicions were converted into real Facts.\r\n\r\nAll Court Slaves, and Sycophants, are so many Spies on Kings and\r\nQueens: They soon discover'd that _Astarte_ was fond, and _Moabdar_\r\njealous. _Arimazius_, his envious Foe, who was as incorrigible as\r\never; for Flints will never soften; and Creatures, that are by\r\nNature venemous, forever retain their Poison. _Arimazius_, I say,\r\nwrote an anonymous Letter to _Moabdar_, the infamous Recourse of\r\nsordid Spirits, who are the Objects of universal Contempt; but in\r\nthis Case, an Affair of the last Importance; because this Letter\r\ntallied with the baneful Suggestions that Monarch had conceiv'd. In\r\nshort, his Thoughts were now wholly bent upon Revenge. He determin'd\r\nto poison _Astarte_ on a certain Night, and to have _Zadig_\r\nstrangled by Break of Day. Orders for that Purpose were expressly\r\ngiven to a merciless, inhuman Eunuch, the ready Executioner of his\r\nVengeance. At that critical Conjuncture, there happen'd to be a\r\nDwarf, who was dumb, but not deaf, in the King's Apartment. Nobody\r\nregarded him: He was an Eye and Ear-witness of all that pass'd, and\r\nyet no more suspected than any irrational Domestic Animal. This\r\nlittle Dwarf had conceiv'd a peculiar Regard for _Astarte_ and\r\n_Zadig_: He heard, with equal Horror and Surprize, the King's Orders\r\nto destroy them both. But how to prevent those Orders from being put\r\ninto Execution, as the Time was so short, was all his Concern. He\r\ncould not write, 'tis true, but he had luckily learnt to draw, and\r\ntake a Likeness. He spent a good Part of the Night in delineating\r\nwith Crayons, on a Piece of Paper, the imminent Danger that thus\r\nattended the Queen. In one Corner, he represented the King highly\r\nincens'd, and giving his cruel Eunuch the fatal Orders; in another,\r\na Bowl and a Cord upon a Table; in the Center was the Queen,\r\nexpiring in the Arms of her Maids of Honour, with _Zadig_ strangled,\r\nand laid dead at her Feet. In the Horizon was the rising Sun, to\r\ndenote, that this execrable Scene was to be exhibited by Break of\r\nDay. No sooner was his Design finish'd, but he ran with it to one of\r\n_Astarte's_ Female Favourites, then in waiting, call'd her up, and\r\ngave her to understand, that she must carry the Draught to _Astarte_\r\nthat very Moment.\r\n\r\nIn the mean Time, the Queen's Attendants, tho' it was Dead of Night,\r\nknock'd at the Door of _Zadig's_ Apartment, wak'd him, and deliver'd\r\ninto his Hands a Billet from the Queen. At first he could not well\r\ntell whether he was only in a Dream or not, but soon read the\r\nLetter, with a trembling Hand, and a heavy Heart: Words can't\r\nexpress his Surprise, and the Agonies of Despair which he was in\r\nupon his perusal of the Contents. _Fly_, said she, _Dear_ Zadig,\r\n_this very Moment; for your Life's in the utmost Danger: Fly, Dear_\r\nZadig, _I conjure you, in the Name of that fatal Passion, with which\r\nI have long struggled, and which I now venture to discover, as I\r\nam to make Atonement for it, in a few Moments, by the Loss of my\r\nLife. Tho' I am conscious to myself of my Innocence, I find I am to\r\nfeel the Weight of my Husband's Resentment, and die the Death of a\r\nTraitor._\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ was scarce able to speak. He order'd his Friend _Cador_ to\r\nbe instantly call'd, and gave him the Letter the Moment he came,\r\nwithout opening his Lips. _Cador_ press'd him to regard the\r\nContents, and to make the best of his Way to _Memphis_. If you\r\npresume, said he, to have an Interview with her Majesty first, you\r\ninevitably hasten her Execution; or if you wait upon the King, the\r\nfatal Consequence will be the same: I'll prevent her unhappy Fate,\r\nif possible; you follow but your own: I'll give it out, that you are\r\ngone to the _Indies_: I'll wait on you as soon as the Hurricane is\r\nblown over, and I'll let you know all that occurs material in\r\n_Babylon_.\r\n\r\n_Cador_, that Instant, order'd two of the fleetest Dromedaries that\r\ncould be got, to be in readiness at a private Back-Door belonging to\r\nthe Court; he help'd _Zadig_ to mount his Beast, tho' ready to drop\r\ninto the Earth. He had but one trusty Servant to attend him, and\r\n_Cador_, overwhelm'd with Grief, soon lost Sight of his dearly\r\nbeloved Friend.\r\n\r\nThis illustrious Fugitive soon reach'd the Summit of a little Hill,\r\nthat afforded him a fair Prospect of the whole City of _Babylon_:\r\nBut turning his Eyes back towards the Queen's Palace, he fainted\r\naway; and when he had recover'd his Senses, he drown'd his Eyes in a\r\nFlood of Tears, and with Impatience wish'd for Death. To conclude,\r\nafter he had reflected, with Horror, on the deplorable Fate of the\r\nmost amiable Creature in the Universe, and of the most meritorious\r\nQueen that ever liv'd; he for a Moment commanded his Passion, and\r\nwith a Sigh, made the following Exclamations: What is this mortal\r\nLife! O Virtue, Virtue, of what Service hast thou been to me! Two\r\nyoung Ladies, a Mistress, and a Wife, have prov'd false to me; a\r\nthird, who is perfectly innocent, and ten thousand Times handsomer\r\nthan either of them, has suffer'd Death, 'tis probable, before this,\r\non my Account! All the Acts of Benevolence which I have shewn, have\r\nbeen the Foundation of my Sorrows, and I have been only rais'd to\r\nthe highest Spoke of Fortune's Wheel, for no other Purpose than to\r\nbe tumbled down with the greater Force. Had I been as abandon'd as\r\nsome Miscreants are, I had like them been happy. His Head thus\r\noverwhelm'd with these melancholy Reflections, his Eyes thus sunk in\r\nhis Head, and his meagre Cheeks all pale and languid; and, in a\r\nWord, his very Soul thus plung'd in the Abyss of deep Despair, he\r\npursu'd his Journey towards _Egypt_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_The Thrash'd_ WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ steer'd his Course by the Stars that shone over his Head.\r\nThe Constellation of Orion, and the radiant Dog-star directed him\r\ntowards the Pole of Canope. He reflected with Admiration on those\r\nimmense Globes of Light, which appear'd to the naked Eye no more\r\nthan little twinkling Lights; whereas the Earth he was then\r\ntraversing, which, in Reality, is no more than an imperceptible\r\nPoint in Nature, seem'd, according to the selfish Idea we generally\r\nentertain of it, something very immense, and very magnificent. He\r\nthen reflected on the whole Race of Mankind, and look'd upon them,\r\nas they are in Fact, a Parcel of Insects, or Reptiles, devouring one\r\nanother on a small Atom of Clay. This just Idea of them greatly\r\nalleviated his Misfortunes, recollecting the Nothingness, if we may\r\nbe allow'd the Expression, of his own Being, and even of _Babylon_\r\nitself. His capacious Soul now soar'd into Infinity, and he\r\ncontemplated, with the same Freedom, as if she was disencumber'd\r\nfrom her earthly Partner, on the immutable Order of the Universe.\r\nBut as soon as she cower'd her Wings, and resumed her native Seat,\r\nhe began to consider that _Astarte_ might possibly have lost her\r\nLife for his Sake; upon which, his Thoughts of the Universe vanish'd\r\nall at once, and no other Objects appear'd before his distemper'd\r\nEyes, but his _Astarte_ giving up the Ghost, and himself overwhelm'd\r\nwith a Sea of Troubles: As he gave himself up to this Flux and\r\nReflux of sublime Philosophy and Anxiety of Mind, he was insensibly\r\narriv'd on the Frontiers of _Egypt_: And his trusty Attendant had,\r\nunknown to him, stept into the first Village, and sought out for a\r\nproper Apartment for his Master and himself. _Zadig_ in the mean\r\nTime made the best of his Way to the adjacent Gardens; where he saw,\r\nnot far distant from the High-way, a young Lady, all drown'd in\r\nTears, calling upon Heaven and Earth for Succour in her Distress,\r\nand a Man, fir'd with Rage and Resentment, in pursuit after her. He\r\nhad now just overtaken her, and she fell prostrate at his Feet\r\nimploring his Forgiveness. He loaded her with a thousand Reproaches;\r\nnor did he spare to chastise her in the most outrageous Manner. By\r\nthe _Egyptian's_ cruel Deportment towards her, he concluded that the\r\nMan was a jealous Husband, and that the Lady was an Inconstant, and\r\nhad defil'd his Bed: But when he reflected, that the Woman was a\r\nperfect Beauty, and to his thinking something like the unfortunate\r\n_Astarte_, he perceiv'd his Heart yearn with Compassion towards the\r\nLady, and swell with Indignation against her Tyrant. For Heaven's\r\nsake, Sir, assist me, said she, to _Zadig_, sobbing as if her Heart\r\nwould break, Oh! deliver me out of the Hands of this _Barbarian_:\r\nSave, Sir, O save my Life. Upon these her shocking Outcries, _Zadig_\r\nthrew himself between the injur'd Lady and the inexorable Brute. And\r\nas he had some smattering of the _Egyptian_ Tongue, he expostulated\r\nwith him in his own Dialect, and said: Dear Sir, if you are endow'd\r\nwith the least Spark of Humanity, let me conjure you to have some\r\nPity and Remorse for so beautiful a Creature; have some Regard, Sir,\r\nto the Weakness of her Sex. How can you treat a Lady, who is one of\r\nNature's Master-pieces, in such a rude and outrageous Manner, one\r\nwho lies weeping at your Feet for Forgiveness, and one who has no\r\nother Recourse than her Tears for her Defence? Oh! Oh! said the\r\njealous-pated Fellow in a Fury to _Zadig_, What! You are one of her\r\nGallants, I suppose. I'll be reveng'd of thee, thou Villain, this\r\nMoment. No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth, but he quits hold\r\nof the Lady, in whose Hair he had twisted his Fingers before, takes\r\nup his Lance in a Fury, and endeavours to the utmost of his Pow'r to\r\nplunge it in the Stranger's Heart: _Zadig_, however, being cool,\r\nwarded the intended Blow with Ease. He laid fast hold of his Lance\r\ntowards the Point. One strove to recover it, and the other to snatch\r\nit away by Force. They broke it between them. Whereupon the\r\n_Egyptian_ drew his Sword. _Zadig_ drew his: They fought: The former\r\nmade a hundred rash Passes one after another, which the latter\r\nparried with the utmost Dexterity. The Lady sat herself upon a\r\nGrass-plat, adjusting her Head-dress, and looking on the Combatants.\r\nThe _Egyptian_ was too strong for _Zadig_, but _Zadig_ was more\r\nnimble and active. The latter fought as a Man whose Hand was guided\r\nby his Head; the former as a Mad-man who dealt about his Blows at\r\nrandom. _Zadig_ took the Advantage, made a Plunge at him, and\r\ndisarm'd him. And forasmuch as he found that the _Egyptian_ was\r\nhotter than ever, and endeavour'd all he could to throw him down by\r\nDint of Strength, _Zadig_ laid fast hold of him, flew upon him, and\r\ntripp'd up his Heels: After that, holding the Point of his Sword to\r\nhis Breast, like a Man of Honour, gave him his Life. The _Egyptian_,\r\nfir'd with Rage, and having no Command of his Passion, drew his\r\nDagger, and wounded _Zadig_ like a Coward, whilst the Victor\r\ngenerously forgave him. Upon that unexpected Action, _Zadig_, being\r\nincens'd to the last Degree, plung'd his Sword deep into his Bosom.\r\nThe _Egyptian_ fetch'd a hideous Groan, and died upon the Spot.\r\n_Zadig_ then approach'd the Lady, and with a kind of Concern, in the\r\nsoftest Terms told her, that he was oblig'd to kill her Insulter,\r\ntho' against his Inclinations. I have aveng'd your Cause, and\r\ndeliver'd you out of the merciless Hands of the most outrageous Man\r\nI ever saw. Now, Madam, let me know your farther Will and Pleasure\r\nwith me. You shall die, you Villain! You have murder'd my Love. Oh!\r\nI could tear your Heart out. Indeed, Madam, said _Zadig_, you had\r\none of the most hot-headed, oddest Lovers I ever saw. He beat you\r\nmost unmercifully, and would have taken away my Life because you\r\ncall'd me in to your Assistance. Would to God he was but alive to\r\nbeat me again, said she, blubbering and roaring; I deserv'd to be\r\nbeat. I gave him too just Occasion to be jealous of me. Would to God\r\nthat he had beat me, and you had died in his Stead! _Zadig_ more\r\nastonish'd, and more exasperated than ever he was in all his Life,\r\nsaid to her: Really, Madam, you put on such extravagant Airs, that\r\nyou tempt me, pretty as you are, to thresh you most cordially in my\r\nTurn; but I scorn to concern my self any more about you. Upon this,\r\nhe remounted his Dromedary, and made the best of his Way towards the\r\nVillage: But before he had got near a hundred Yards, he return'd\r\nupon an Out-cry that was made by four Couriers from _Babylon_. They\r\nrode full Speed. One of them, spying the young Widow, cried out.\r\nThere she is, That's she. She answers in every Respect to the\r\nDescription we had of her. They never took the least Notice of her\r\ndead Gallant, but secur'd her directly. Oh! Sir, cried she to\r\n_Zadig_, again and again, dear Sir, most generous Stranger, once\r\nmore deliver me from a Pack of Villains. I most humbly beg your\r\nPardon for my late Conduct and unjust Complaint of you. Do but stand\r\nmy Friend, at this critical Conjuncture, and I'll be your most\r\nobedient Vassal till Death. _Zadig_ had now no Inclination to fight\r\nfor one so undeserving any more. Find some other to be your Fool\r\nnow, Madam; you shan't impose upon me a second Time. I'll assure\r\nyou, Madam, I know better Things. Besides he was wounded; and bled\r\nso fast that he wanted Assistance himself: And 'tis very probable,\r\nthat the Sight of the _Babylonian_ Couriers, who were dispatch'd\r\nfrom King _Moabdar_, might discompose him very much. He made all the\r\nHaste he could towards the Village, not being able to conceive what\r\nshould be the real Cause of the young Lady's being secur'd by those\r\n_Babylonish_ Officers, and as much at a Loss, at the same Time, what\r\nto think of such a Termagant and a Coquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n_The_ CAPTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner was _Zadig_ arriv'd at the _Egyptian_ Village\r\nbefore-mention'd, but he found himself surrounded by a Croud. The\r\nPeople one and all cried out! See! See! there's the Man that ran\r\naway with the beauteous Lady _Missouf_, and murder'd _Cletofis_.\r\nGentlemen, said he, God forbid that I should ever entertain a\r\nThought of running away with the Lady you speak of: She is too much\r\nof a Coquet: And as to _Cletofis_, I did not murder him, but kill'd\r\nhim in my own Defence. He endeavour'd all he could to take my Life\r\naway, because I entreated him to take some Pity and Compassion on\r\nthe beauteous _Missouf_, whom he beat most unmercifully. I am a\r\nStranger, who am fled hither for Shelter, and 'tis highly\r\nimprobable, that upon my first Entrance into a Country, where I came\r\nfor Safety and Protection, I should be guilty of two such enormous\r\nCrimes, as that of running away with another Man's Partner, and that\r\nof clandestinely murdering him on her Account.\r\n\r\nThe _Egyptians_ at that Time were just and humane. The Populace, tis\r\ntrue, hurried _Zadig_ to the Town-Goal; but they took care in the\r\nfirst Place to stop the Bleeding of his Wounds, and afterwards\r\nexamin'd the suppos'd Delinquents apart, in order to discover, if\r\npossible, the real Truth. They acquitted _Zadig_ of the Charge of\r\nwilful and premeditated Murder; but as he had taken a Subject's Life\r\naway, tho' in his own Defence, he was sentenc'd to be a Slave, as\r\nthe Law directed. His two Beasts were sold in open Market, for the\r\nService of the Hamlet; What Money he had was distributed amongst the\r\nInhabitants; and he and his Attendant were expos'd in the\r\nMarket-place to public Sale. An _Arabian_ Merchant, _Setoc_ by Name,\r\npurchas'd them both; but as the Valet, or Attendant, was a robust\r\nMan, and better cut out for hard Labour than the Master, he fetch'd\r\nthe most Money. There was no Comparison to be made between them.\r\n_Zadig_ therefore was a Slave subordinate to his Valet; they secur'd\r\nthem both, however, by a Chain upon their Legs; and so link'd they\r\naccompanied their Master home. _Zadig_, as they were on the Road,\r\ncomforted his Fellow-Slave, and exhorted him to bear his Misfortunes\r\nwith Patience: But, according to Custom, he made several Reflections\r\non the Vicissitudes of human Life. I am now sensible, said he, that\r\nmy impropitious Fortune has some malignant Influence over thine;\r\nevery Occurrence of my Life hitherto has prov'd strangely odd and\r\nunaccountable. In the first Place, I was sentenc'd to die at\r\n_Babylon_, for writing a short Panegyrick on the King, my Master. In\r\nthe next, I narrowly escap'd being strangled, for the Queen his\r\nRoyal Consort's speaking a little too much in my Favour; and here I\r\nam a joint-Slave with thy self; because a turbulent Fellow of a\r\nGallant would beat his Lady. However, Comrade, let us march on\r\nboldly; let not our Courage be cast down; all this may possibly have\r\na happier Issue than we expect. 'Tis absolutely necessary that these\r\n_Arabian_ Merchants should have Slaves, and why should not you and\r\nI, as we are but Men, be Slaves as Thousands of others are? This\r\nMaster of ours may not prove inexorable. He must treat his Slaves\r\nwith some Thought and Consideration, if he expects them to do his\r\nWork. This was his Discourse to his Comrade; but his Mind was more\r\nattentive to the Misfortunes of the Queen of _Babylon_.\r\n\r\nTwo Days afterwards _Setoc_ set out with his two Slaves and his\r\nCamels, for _Arabia Deserta_. His Tribe liv'd near the Desert of\r\n_Horeb_. The Way was long and tedious. _Setoc_, during the Journey,\r\npaid a much greater Regard to _Zadig's_ Valet, than to himself;\r\nbecause the former was the most able to load the Camels; and\r\ntherefore what little Distinctions were made, they were in his\r\nFavour. It so happen'd that one of the Camels died upon the Road:\r\nThe Load which the Beast carried was immediately divided, and thrown\r\nupon the Shoulders of the two Slaves; _Zadig_ had his Share.\r\n_Setoc_, couldn't forbear laughing to see his two Slaves crouching\r\nunder their Burthen. _Zadig_ took the Liberty to explain the Reason\r\nthereof; and convinc'd him of the Laws of the Equilibrium. The\r\nMerchant was a little startled at his philosophical Discourse, and\r\nlook'd upon him with a more favourable Eye than at first. _Zadig_,\r\nperceiving he had rais'd his Curiosity, redoubled it, by instructing\r\nhim in several material Points, which were in some Measure,\r\nadvantageous to him in his Way of Business: Such as, the specific\r\nWeight of Metals, and other Commodities of various Kinds, of an\r\nequal Bulk; the Properties of several useful Animals, and the best\r\nWays and Means to make Such as were wild, tame by Degrees, and fit\r\nfor Service: In short, _Zadig_ was look'd upon by his Master, as a\r\nperfect Oracle. _Setoc_ now thought the Master the much better Man\r\nof the two. He us'd him courteously, and had no Room to repent of\r\nhis Indulgence towards him.\r\n\r\nBeing got to their Journey's End, the first Step that _Setoc_ took\r\nwas to claim a Debt of five hundred Ounces of Silver of a _Jew_, who\r\nhad borrow'd it in the Presence of two Witnesses; but both of them\r\nwere dead; and as the _Jew_ was conscious he couldn't be cast for\r\nWant of Evidence, appropriated the Merchant's Money to his own Use,\r\nand thank'd God that it lay in his Power for once to bite an\r\n_Arabian_ with Impunity. _Setoc_ discover'd to _Zadig_ the unhappy\r\nSituation of his Case, as he was now become his Confident. Where was\r\nit, pray, said _Zadig_, that you lent this large Sum to that\r\nungrateful Infidel? Upon a large Stone, said the Merchant, at the\r\nFoot of Mount _Horeb_. What sort of a Man is your Debtor, said\r\n_Zadig_? Oh! he is as errand a Rogue as ever breath'd, reply'd\r\n_Setoc_. That I take for granted; but, says _Zadig_, is he a lively,\r\nactive Man, or is he a dull heavy-headed Fellow? He is one of the\r\nworst of Pay-masters in the World, but the merriest, most sprightly\r\nFellow I ever met with. Very well! said _Zadig_, let me be one of\r\nyour Council when your Cause comes to be heard. In short, he\r\nsummon'd the _Jew_ to attend the Court; where, when the Judge was\r\nsat, _Zadig_ open'd the Cause: Thou impartial Judge of this Court of\r\nEquity, I am come here, in behalf of my Master, to demand of the\r\nDefendant five hundred Ounces of Silver, which he refuses to pay,\r\nand would fain traverse the Debt. Have you, Friend, your Witnesses\r\nready to prove the Loan, said the Judge? No, they are dead; but\r\nthere is a large Stone still subsisting, on which the Money was\r\ndeposited; and if your Excellence, will be pleas'd to order the\r\nStone to be brought in Court, I don't doubt but the Evidence it will\r\ngive, will be Proof sufficient of the Fact. I hope your Excellence\r\nwill order, that the _Jew_ and myself shall be oblig'd to attend the\r\nCourt, till the Stone comes, and I'll dispatch a special Messenger\r\nto fetch it, at my Master's Expence. Your Request is very\r\nreasonable, said the Judge. Do as you propose; and so call'd another\r\nCause.\r\n\r\nWhen the Court was ready to break up, Well! said the Judge to\r\n_Zadig_, is your Stone come yet? The _Jew_, with a Sneer, replied,\r\nyour Excellence may wait here till this Time To-morrow, before the\r\nStone will appear in Court; for 'tis above six Mile off, and it will\r\nrequire fifteen Men to remove it from its Place. 'Tis well! replied\r\n_Zadig_. I told your Excellence that the Stone would be a very\r\nmaterial Evidence. Since the Defendant can point out the Place where\r\nthe Stone lies, he tacitly confesses, that it was upon that Stone\r\nthe Money was deposited. The _Jew_ thus unexpectedly confuted, was\r\nsoon oblig'd to acknowledge the Debt. The Judge order'd that the\r\n_Jew_ should be tied fast to the Stone, without Victuals or Drink,\r\ntill he should advance the five hundred Ounces of Silver, which were\r\nsoon paid accordingly, and the _Jew_ releas'd. The Slave _Zadig_,\r\nand this remarkable Stone-Witness, were in great Repute all over\r\n_Arabia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n_The_ FUNERAL PILE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Setoc_, transported with his good Success, of a Slave made _Zadig_\r\nhis Favourite Companion and Confident; he found him as necessary in\r\nthe Conduct of his Affairs, as the King of _Babylon_ had before done\r\nin the Administration of his Government; and lucky it was for\r\n_Zadig_ that _Setoc_ had no Wife.\r\n\r\nHe discover'd, that his Master was in his Temper benevolent,\r\nstrictly honest, and a Man of good natural Parts. _Zadig_ was very\r\nmuch concern'd, that One of so much Sense should pay divine\r\nAdoration to a whole Host of created, tho' Celestial Beings, that is\r\nto say, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, according to the antient Custom of\r\nthe _Arabians_. He talk'd, at first, to his Master, with great\r\nPrecaution on so important a Topick. But at last told him, in direct\r\nTerms, that they were created Bodies, as others, tho' of less\r\nLustre, and that there was no more Adoration due to them, than to a\r\nStock or a Stone. But, said _Setoc_, they are eternal Beings to whom\r\nwe are indebted for all the Blessings we enjoy; they animate Nature;\r\nthey regulate the Seasons; they are, in a Word, at such an infinite\r\nDistance from us, that it would be downright impious not to adore\r\nthem. You are more indebted, said _Zadig_, to the Waters of the Red\r\nSea, which transport so many valuable Commodities into the _Indies_.\r\nWhy, pray, may not they be deem'd as antient as the Stars? And if\r\nyou are so fond of paying your Adoration on Account of their vast\r\nDistance; why don't you adore the Land of the _Gangarides_, which\r\nlies in the utmost Extremities of the Earth. No, said _Setoc_, there\r\nis something so surprisingly more brilliant in the Stars than what\r\nyou speak of; that a Man must adore them whether he will or not.\r\n\r\nAt the Close of the Evening, _Zadig_ planted a long Range of Candles\r\nin the Front of his Tent, where _Setoc_ and he were to sup that\r\nNight: And as soon as he perceiv'd his Patron to be at the Door, he\r\nfell prostrate on his Knees before the Wax-Lights. O ye everlasting,\r\never-shining Luminaries, be always propitious to your Votary, said\r\n_Zadig_. Having repeated these Words so loud as _Setoc_ might hear\r\nthem, he sat down to Table, without taking the least Notice of\r\n_Setoc_. What! said _Setoc_, somewhat startled at his Conduct, art\r\nthou at thy Prayers before Supper? I act just as inconsistently,\r\nSir, as you do; I worship these Candles; without reflecting on their\r\nMakers, or yourself, who are my most beneficent Patron.\r\n\r\n_Setoc_ took the Hint, and was conscious of the Reproof that was\r\nconceal'd so genteely under a Vail. The superior Wisdom of his Slave\r\nenlightned his Mind; and from that Hour he was less lavish than ever\r\nhe had been, of his Incense to those created Beings, and for the\r\nfuture, paid his Adoration to the eternal God who made them.\r\n\r\nAt that Time there was a most hideous Custom in high Repute all over\r\n_Arabia_, which came originally from _Scythia_; but having met with\r\nthe Sanction of the bigotted Brachmans, threatn'd to spread its\r\nInfection all over the _East_. When a married Man happen'd to die,\r\nif his dearly beloved Widow ever expected to be esteem'd a Saint,\r\nshe must throw herself headlong upon her Husband's Funeral-Pile.\r\nThis was look'd upon as a solemn Festival, and was call'd the\r\nWidow's Sacrifice. That Tribe which could boast of the greatest\r\nNumber of burnt-Widows, was look'd upon as the most meritorious. An\r\n_Arabian_, who was of the Tribe of _Setoc_, happen'd just at that\r\nJuncture, to be dead, and his Widow (_Almona_ by Name) who was a\r\nnoted Devotee, publish'd the Day, nay, the Hour, that she propos'd\r\nto throw herself (according to Custom) on her deceased Husband's\r\nFuneral Pile, and be attended by a Concert of Drums and Trumpets.\r\n_Zadig_ remonstrated to _Setoc_, what a shocking Custom this was,\r\nand how directly repugnant to human Nature; by permitting young\r\nWidows, almost every Day, to become wilful Self-Murderers; when they\r\nmight be of Service to their Country, either by the Addition of new\r\nSubjects, or by the Education of such as demanded their Maternal\r\nIndulgence. And, by arguing seriously with _Setoc_ for some Time, he\r\nforc'd from him at last, an ingenuous Confession, that the barbarous\r\nCustom then subsisting, ought, if possible, to be abolish'd. 'Tis\r\nnow, replied _Setoc_, above a thousand Years since the Widows of\r\n_Arabia_ have been indulg'd with this Privilege of dying with their\r\nHusbands; and how shall any one dare to abrogate a Law that has been\r\nestablish'd Time out of Mind? Is there any Thing more inviolable\r\nthan even an antient Error? But, replied _Zadig_, Reason is of more\r\nantient Date than the Custom you plead for. Do you communicate these\r\nSentiments to the Sovereigns of your Tribes, and in the mean while\r\nI'll go, and sound the Widow's Inclinations.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he paid her a Visit, and having insinuated himself into\r\nher Favour, by a few Compliments on her Beauty, after urging what a\r\npity it was, that a young Widow, Mistress of so many Charms, should\r\nmake away with herself for no other reason but to mingle her Ashes\r\nwith a Husband that was dead; he, notwithstanding, applauded her for\r\nher heroic Constancy and Courage. I perceive, Madam, said he, you\r\nwas excessively fond of your deceased Spouse. Not I truly, reply'd\r\nthe young _Arabian_ Devotee. He was a Brute, infected with a\r\ngroundless Jealousy of my Virtue; and, in short, a perfect Tyrant.\r\nBut, notwithstanding all this, I am determin'd to comply with our\r\nCustom. Surely then, Madam, there's a Sort of secret Pleasure in\r\nbeing burnt alive. Alas! with a Sigh, cried _Almona_, 'tis a Shock\r\nindeed to Nature; but must be complied with for all that. I am a\r\nprofess'd Devotee, and should I shew the least Reluctance, my\r\nReputation would be lost for ever; all the World would laugh at me,\r\nshould I not burn myself on this Occasion: _Zadig_ having forc'd her\r\ningenuously to confess, that she parted with her Life more out of\r\nRegard to what the World would say of her, and out of Pride and\r\nOstentation, than any real Love for the deceas'd, he talk'd to her\r\nfor some considerable Time so rationally, and us'd so many\r\nprevailing Arguments with her to justify her due Regard for the Life\r\nwhich she was going to throw away, that she began to wave the\r\nThought, and entertain a secret Affection for her friendly Monitor.\r\nPray, Madam, tell me, said _Zadig_, how would you dispose of\r\nyourself, upon the Supposition, that you could shake off this vain\r\nand barbarous Notion? Why, said Dame, with an amorous Glance, I\r\nthink verily I should accept of yourself for a second Bed-fellow.\r\n\r\nThe Memory of _Astarte_ had made too strong an Impression on his\r\nMind, to close with this warm Declaration: He took his leave,\r\nhowever, that Moment, and waited on the Chiefs. He communicated to\r\nthem the Substance of their private Conversation, and prevailed with\r\nthem to make it a Law for the future, that no Widow should be\r\nallow'd to fall a Victim to a deceased Husband, till after she had\r\nadmitted some young Man to converse with her in private for a whole\r\nHour together. The Law was pass'd accordingly, and not one Widow in\r\nall _Arabia_, from that Day to this, ever observ'd the Custom. 'Twas\r\nto _Zadig_ alone that the _Arabian_ Dames were indebted for the\r\nAbolition, in one Hour, of a Custom so very inhuman, that had been\r\npractis'd for such a Number of Ages. _Zadig_, therefore, with the\r\nstrictest Justice, was look'd upon by all the Fair Sex in _Arabia_,\r\nas their most bountiful Benefactor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n_The Evening's Entertainment._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Setoc_, who would never stir out without his Bosom-Friend (in whom\r\nalone, as he thought, all Wisdom center'd) resolv'd to take him with\r\nhim to _Balzora_ Fair, whither the richest Merchants round the whole\r\nhabitable Globe, us'd annually to resort. _Zadig_ was delighted to\r\nsee such a Concourse of substantial Tradesmen from all Countries,\r\nassembled together in one Place. It appear'd to him, as if the whole\r\nUniverse was but one large Family, and all happily met together at\r\n_Balzora_. On the second Day of the Fair, he sat down to Table with\r\nan _Egyptian_, an _Indian_, that liv'd on the Banks of the River\r\n_Ganges_, an Inhabitant of _Cathay_, a _Grecian_, a _Celt_, and\r\nseveral other Foreigners, who by their frequent Voyages towards the\r\n_Arabian_ Gulf, were so far conversant with the _Arabic_ Language,\r\nas to be able to discourse freely, and be mutually understood. The\r\n_Egyptian_ began to fly into a Passion; what a scandalous Place is\r\nthis _Balzora_, said he, where they refuse to lend me a thousand\r\nOunces of Gold, upon the best Security that can possibly be offer'd.\r\nPray, said _Setoc_, what may the Commodity be that you would deposit\r\nas a Pledge for the Sum you mention. Why, the Corpse of my deceased\r\nAunt, said he, who was one of the finest Women in all _Egypt_. She\r\nwas my constant Companion; but unhappily died upon the Road. I have\r\ntaken so much Care, that no Mummy whatever can equal it: And was I\r\nin my own Country, I could be furnish'd with what Sum soever I\r\npleas'd, were I dispos'd to mortgage it. 'Tis a strange Thing that\r\nNobody here will advance so small a Sum upon so valuable a\r\nCommodity. No sooner had he express'd his Resentment, but he was\r\ngoing to cut up a fine boil'd Pullet, in order to make a Meal on't,\r\nwhen an _Indian_ laid hold of his Hand, and with deep Concern, cried\r\nout, For God's Sake what are you about? Why, said the _Egyptian_, I\r\ndesign to make a Wing of this Fowl one Part of my Supper. Pray, good\r\nSir, consider what you are doing, said the _Indian_. 'Tis very\r\npossible, that the Soul of the deceas'd Lady may have taken its\r\nResidence in that Fowl. And you wouldn't surely run the Risque of\r\neating up your Aunt? To boil a Fowl is, doubtless, a most shameful\r\nOutrage  done  to Nature. Pshaw! What a Pother you make about the\r\nboiling of a Fowl, and flying in the Face of Nature, replied the\r\n_Egyptian_ in a Pet; tho' we _Egyptians_ pay divine Adoration to the\r\nOx; yet we can make a hearty Meal of a Piece of roast Beef for all\r\nthat. Is it possible, Sir, that your Country-men should act so\r\nabsurdly, as to pay an Ox the Tribute of divine Worship, said the\r\n_Indian_? Absurd as you think it, said the other, the Ox has been\r\nthe principal Object of Adoration all over _Egypt_, for these\r\nhundred and thirty five thousand Years, and the most abandon'd\r\n_Egyptian_ has never been as yet so impious as to gain-say it. Ay,\r\nSir, an hundred thirty five thousand Years, say you, surely you must\r\nbe out a little in your Calculation. 'Tis but about fourscore\r\nthousand Years, since _India_ was first inhabited. Sure I am, we are\r\na more antient People than you are, and our _Brama_ prohibited the\r\neating of Beef long before your Nation ever erected an Altar in\r\nHonour of the Ox, or ever put one upon a Spit. What a Racket you\r\nmake about your _Brama_! Is he able to stand the least in\r\nCompetition with our _Apis_, said the _Egyptian_? Let us hear, pray,\r\nwhat mighty Feats have been done by your boasted _Brama_? Why,\r\nreplied the _Bramin_, he first taught his Votaries to write and\r\nread; and 'tis to him alone, all the World is indebted for the\r\nInvention of the noble Game of Chess. You are quite out, Sir, in\r\nyour Notion, said a _Chaldean_, who sat within Hearing: All these\r\ninvaluable Blessings were deriv'd from the Fish _Oannes_; and 'tis\r\nthat alone to which the Tribute of divine Adoration is justly due.\r\nAll the World will tell you, that 'twas a divine Being whose Tail\r\nwas pure Gold, whose Head resembled that of a Man, tho' indeed the\r\nFeatures were much more beautiful; and that he condescended to visit\r\nthe Earth three Hours every Day, for the Instruction of Mankind. He\r\nhad a numerous Issue, as is very well known, and all of them were\r\npowerful Monarchs. I have a Picture of it at Home, to which, as in\r\nDuty I ought, I Say my Prayers at Night before I go to Bed, and\r\nevery Morning that I rise. There is no Harm, Sir, as I can conceive,\r\nin partaking of a Piece of roast Beef; but, doubtless, 'tis a mortal\r\nSin, a Crime of the blackest Dye, to touch a Piece of Fish. Besides,\r\nyou cannot justly boast of so illustrious an Origin, and you are\r\nboth of you mere Moderns, in Comparison to us _Chaldeans_, You\r\n_Egyptians_ lay claim to no more than 135,000 Years, and you\r\n_Indians_, but of 80,000. Whereas we have Almanacks that are dated\r\n4000 Centuries backwards. Take my Word for it; I speak nothing but\r\nTruth; renounce your Errors, and I'll make each of you a Present of\r\na fine Portrait of our _Oannes_.\r\n\r\nA Native of _Cambalu_, entring into the Debate, said, I have a very\r\ngreat Veneration, not only for the _Egyptians_, _Chaldeans_,\r\n_Greeks_, and _Celtae_; but for _Brama_, _Apis_, and the _Oannes_,\r\nbut in my humble Opinion, the *_Li_, or as 'tis by some call'd,\r\nthe *_Tien_, is an Object more deserving of divine Adoration than\r\nany Ox, or Fish, how much soever you may boast of their respective\r\nPerfections. All I shall say, in regard to my native Country, 'tis\r\nof much greater Extent, than all _Egypt_, _Chaldea_, and the\r\n_Indies_ put together. I shall lay no Stress on the Antiquity of my\r\nCountry; for I imagine 'tis of much greater Importance to be the\r\nhappiest People, than the most antient under the Sun. However, since\r\nyou were talking of the Almanacks, I must beg the Liberty to tell\r\nyou, that ours are look'd upon to be the best all over _Asia_; and\r\nthat we had several very correct ones before the Art of Arithmetick\r\nwas ever heard of in _Chaldea_.\r\n\r\n    * _The_ Chinese _Term_, Li, _signifies, properly\r\n      speaking, natural Light, or Reason; and_ Tien, _the\r\n      Heavens, or the supreme Being._\r\n\r\nYou are all of you a Parcel of illiterate, ignorant Bigots, cry'd a\r\n_Grecian_: 'Tis plain, you know nothing of the Chaos, and that the\r\nWorld, as it now stands, is owing wholly to _Matter_ and _Form_. The\r\n_Greek_ ran on for a considerable Time; but was at last interrupted\r\nby a _Celt_, who having drank deep, during the whole Time of this\r\nDebate, thought himself ten Times wiser than any of his Antagonists;\r\nand wrapping out a great Oath, insisted, that all their Gods were\r\nnothing, if set in Competition with the _Teutath_ or the Misletoe on\r\nthe Oak. As for my part, said he, I carry some of it always in my\r\nPocket: As to my Ancestors, they were _Scythians_, and the only Men\r\nworth talking of in the whole World: 'Tis true, indeed, they would\r\nnow and then make a Meal of their Country-men, but that ought not to\r\nbe urg'd as any Objection to his Country; and, in short, if any one\r\nof you, or all of you, shall dare to say any thing disrespectful of\r\n_Teutath_, I'll defend its Cause to the last Drop of my Blood. The\r\nQuarrel grew warmer and warmer, and _Setoc_ expected that the Table\r\nwould be overset, and that Blood-shed would ensue. _Zadig_, who\r\nhadn't once open'd his Lips during the whole Controversy, at last\r\nrose up, and address'd himself to the _Celt_, in the first Place, as\r\nbeing the most noisy and outrageous. Sir, said he, Your Notions in\r\nthis Affair are very just: Good Sir, oblige me with a Bit of your\r\nMisletoe. Then turning about, he expatiated on the Eloquence of the\r\n_Grecian_, and in a Word, soften'd in the most artful Manner all the\r\ncontending Parties. He said but little indeed to the _Cathayian_;\r\nbecause he was more cool, and sedate than any of the others. To\r\nconclude, he address'd them all in general Terms, to this or the\r\nlike Effect: My dear Friends, You have been contesting all this\r\nwhile about an important Topick, in which 'tis evident, you are all\r\nunanimously agreed. Agreed, quotha! they all cried, in an angry\r\nTone, How so, pray? Why said he to the hot, testy _Celt_, is it not\r\ntrue, that you do not in effect adore this Misletoe, but that Being\r\nwho created that Misletoe and the Oak, to which it is so closely\r\nunited? Doubtless, Sir, reply'd the _Celt_. And you, Sir, said he,\r\nto the _Egyptian_, You revere, thro' your venerable _Apis_, the\r\ngreat Author of every Ox's Being. We do so, said the _Egyptian_. The\r\nmighty _Oannes_, tho' the Sovereign of the Sea, continued he, must\r\ngive Precedence to that Power, who made both the Sea, and every Fish\r\nthat dwells therein. We allow it, said the _Chaldean_. The _Indian_,\r\nadds he, and the _Cathayan_, acknowledge one supreme Being, or first\r\nCause, as well as you. As to what that profound worthy Gentleman the\r\n_Grecian_ has advanc'd, is, I must own, a little above my weak\r\nComprehension, but I am fully persuaded, that he will allow there is\r\na supreme Being on whom his favourite Matter and Form are entirely\r\ndependent. The _Grecian_, who was look'd upon as a Sage amongst\r\nthem, said, with Abundance of Gravity, that _Zadig_, had made a very\r\njust Construction of his Meaning. Now, Gentlemen, I appeal to you\r\nall, said _Zadig_, whether you are not unanimous to a Man, in the\r\nDebate upon the Carpet, and whether there are any just Grounds for\r\nthe least Divisions or Animosities amongst you. The whole Company,\r\ncool at once, caress'd him; and _Setoc_, after he had sold off all\r\nhis Goods and Merchandize at a round Price, took his Friend _Zadig_\r\nHome with him to the Land of _Horeb_. _Zadig_, upon his first\r\nArrival was inform'd, that a Prosecution had been carried on against\r\nhim during his Absence, and that the Sentence pronounc'd against him\r\nwas, that he should be burnt alive before a slow Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n_The_ RENDEZVOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst _Zadig_ attended his Friend _Setoc_ to _Balzora_, the Priests\r\nof the Stars were determin'd to punish him. As all the costly\r\nJewels, and other valuable Decorations, in which every young Widow\r\nthat sacrificed her self on her Husband's Funeral-pile, were their\r\ncustomary Fees, 'tis no great Wonder, indeed, that they were\r\ninclin'd to burn poor _Zadig_, for playing them such a scurvy Trick.\r\n_Zadig_ therefore, was accus'd of holding heretical and damnable\r\nTenets, in regard to the Celestial Host: They depos'd, and swore\r\npoint-blank, that he had been heard to aver, that the Stars never\r\nsat in the Sea. This horrid blasphemous Declaration thunder-struck\r\nall the Judges, and they were ready to rend their Mantles at the\r\nSound of such an impious Assertion; and they would have made\r\n_Zadig_, had he been a Man of Substance, paid very severely for his\r\nheretical Notions. But in the Height of their Pity and Compassion\r\nfor even such an Infidel, they would lay no Fine upon him; but\r\ncontent themselves with seeing him roasted alive before a slow Fire.\r\n_Setoc_, tho' without Hopes of Success, us'd all the Interest he had\r\nto save his bosom Friend from so shocking a Death; but they turn'd a\r\ndeaf Ear to all his Remonstrances, and oblig'd him to hold his\r\nTongue. The young Widow _Almona_, who by this Time was not only\r\nreconcil'd to living a little longer, but had some Taste for the\r\nPleasures of Life, and knew that she was entirely indebted to\r\n_Zadig_ for it, resolv'd, if possible, to free her Benefactor from\r\nbeing burnt, as he had before convinc'd her of the Folly of it in\r\nher Case. She ponder'd upon this weighty Affair very seriously; but\r\nsaid nothing to any one whomsoever. _Zadig_ was to be executed the\r\nnext Day; and she had only a few Hours left to carry her Project\r\ninto Execution. Now the Reader shall hear with how much Benevolence\r\nand Discretion this amiable Widow behav'd on this emergent Occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the first Place, she made use of the most costly Perfumes; and\r\ndrest herself to the utmost Advantage to render her Charms as\r\nconspicuous as possible; And thus gaily attir'd, demanded a private\r\nAudience of the High Priest of the Stars. Upon her first Admittance\r\ninto his august and venerable Presence, she address'd herself in the\r\nfollowing Terms. O thou first-born and well-beloved Son of the Great\r\nBear, Brother of the Bull, and first Cousin to the Dog, (these you\r\nmust know were the Pontiff's high Titles) I come to confess myself\r\nbefore you: My Conscience is my Accuser, and I am terribly afraid I\r\nhave been guilty of a mortal Sin, by declining the stated Custom of\r\nburning my self on my Husband's Funeral-pile? What could tempt me,\r\nin short, to a Prolongation of my Life, I can't imagine, I, who am\r\ngrown a perfect Skeleton, all wrinkled and deform'd. She paus'd, and\r\npulling off, with a negligent but artful Air, her long silk Gloves;\r\nShe display'd a soft, plump, naked Arm, and white as Snow: You see,\r\nSir, said she, that all my Charms are blasted. Blasted, Madam, said\r\nthe luscious Pontiff; No! Your Charms are still resistless: His\r\nEyes, and his Mouth, with which he kiss'd her Hand, confirm'd their\r\nPower: Such an Arm, Madam, by the Great _Orasmades_, I never saw\r\nbefore. Alas! said the Widow, with a modest Blush; my Arm Sir, 'tis\r\nprobable, may have the Advantage of any hidden Part; but see, good\r\nFather, what a Neck is here; as yellow as Saffron, an Object not\r\nworth regarding. Then she display'd such a snowy, panting Bosom,\r\nthat Nature could not mend it. A Rose-Bud on an Ivory Apple, would,\r\nif set in Competition with her spotless Whiteness, make no better\r\nAppearance than common Madder upon a Shrub; and the whitest Wool,\r\njust out of the Laver, were she but by, would seem but of a\r\nlight-brown Hue.\r\n\r\nHer Neck, her large black, sparkling Eyes, that languishingly\r\nroll'd, and seem'd as 'twere, on Fire; her lovely Cheeks, glowing\r\nwith White and Red, her Nose, that was not unlike the Tower of Mount\r\n_Lebanon_, her Lips, which were like two Borders of Coral, inclosing\r\ntwo Rows of the best Pearls in the _Arabian_ Sea; such a\r\nCombination, I say, of Charms, made the old Pontiff judge she was\r\nscarce twenty Years of Age; and in a kind of Flutter, to make her a\r\nDeclaration of his tender Regard for her. _Almona_, perceiving him\r\nenamour'd, begg'd his Interest in Favour of _Zadig_. Alas! my dear\r\nCharmer, my Interest alone, when you request the Favour, would be\r\nbut a poor Compliment; I'll take care his Acquittance shall be\r\nsigned by three more of my Brother Priests. Do you sign first,\r\nhowever, said _Almona_. With all my Soul, said the amorous Pontiff,\r\nprovided----you'll be kind, my dearest. You do me too much Honour,\r\nsaid _Almona_; but should you give your self the Trouble to pay me a\r\nVisit after Sunset, and as soon as the Star _Sheat_ twinkles on the\r\nHorizon, you shall find me, most venerable Father, repos'd upon a\r\nrosy-colour'd silver Sopha, where you shall use your Pleasure with\r\nyour humble Servant. With that she made him a low Courtesy; took up\r\n_Zadig's_ general Release as soon as duely sign'd, and left the old\r\nDoatard all over Love, tho' somewhat diffident of his own Abilities.\r\nThe Residue of the Day he spent in his Bagnio; he drank large\r\nenlivening Draughts of a Water distill'd from the Cinnamon of\r\n_Ceilan_, and the costly Spices of _Tidor_ and _Ternate_, and waited\r\nwith the utmost Impatience for the up-rising of the brilliant\r\n_Sheat_.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time _Almona_ went to the second Pontiff. He assur'd her\r\nthat the Sun, Moon, and all the starry Host of Heav'n, were but\r\nlanguid Fires to her bright Eyes. He put the Question to her, in\r\nshort, at once, and agreed to sign upon her Compliance. She suffer'd\r\nherself to be over-persuaded, and made an Assignation to meet him at\r\na certain Place, as soon as the Star _Algenib_ should make its\r\nAppearance. From him she repair'd to the third and fourth Pontiff,\r\ntaking care, wherever she went, to see _Zadig's_ Acquittance duely\r\nsign'd, and made fresh Appointments at the Rising of Star after\r\nStar.\r\n\r\nWhen she had carried her Point thus far, she sent a proper Message\r\nto the Judges of the Court, who had condemn'd _Zadig_, requesting\r\nthat they would come to her House, that she might advise with them\r\nupon an Affair of the last Importance. They waited on her\r\naccordingly; she produc'd _Zadig's_ Discharge duly sign'd by four\r\nseveral Hands, and told them the Definitive Treaty between all the\r\ncontracting Parties. Each of the pontifical Gallants observ'd their\r\nSummons to a Moment. Each was startled at the Sight of his Rival;\r\nbut perfectly thunderstruck to see the Judges, before whom the Widow\r\nhad laid open her Case. _Zadig_ procur'd an absolute Pardon, and\r\n_Setoc_ was so charm'd with the artful Address of _Almona_, that he\r\nmarried her the next Day. _Zadig_ went afterwards to throw himself\r\nat the Feet of his fair Benefactress. _Setoc_ and he took their\r\nLeave of each other with Tears in their Eyes, and vowing that an\r\neternal mutual Friendship should be preserv'd between them; and, in\r\nshort, should Fortune at any Time afterwards prove more propitious\r\nthan could well be expected to either Party; the other should\r\npartake of an equal Share of his Success.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ steer'd his Course towards _Syria_; forever pondering on the\r\nhard Fate of the justly-admir'd _Astarte_, and reflecting on his own\r\nStars that so obstinately darted down their malignant Rays, and\r\ncontinu'd daily to torment him. What, said he! to pay four hundred\r\nOunces of Gold for only seeing a Bitch pass by me; to be condemn'd\r\nto be beheaded for four witless Verses in Praise of the King; to be\r\nstrangled to Death, because a Queen was pleas'd to look upon me; to\r\nbe made a Prisoner, and sold as a Slave for saving a young Lady from\r\nbeing sorely abus'd by a Brute rather than a Man; and to be upon the\r\nBrink of being roasted alive, for no other Offence than saving for\r\nthe future all the Widows in _Arabia_ from becoming idle\r\nBurnt-Offerings, and mingling their Ashes with those of their\r\ndeceased worthless Husbands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ FREE-BOOTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zadig_, arriving at the Frontiers which separate _Arabia Petraea_\r\nfrom _Syria_, and passing by a very strong Castle, several arm'd\r\n_Arabians_ rush'd out upon him, and surrounding him, cried out:\r\nWhatever you have belonging to you is our Property, but as for your\r\nPerson, that is entirely at our Sovereign's Disposal. _Zadig_,\r\ninstead of making any Reply, drew his Sword, and as his Attendant\r\nwas a very couragious Fellow, he drew likewise. Those who laid hold\r\non them, first fell a Sacrifice to their Fury: Their Numbers\r\nredoubled: Yet still, Both dauntless, determin'd to conquer or to\r\ndie. When two Men defend themselves against a whole Gang, the\r\nContest, doubtless, cannot last long. The Master of the Castle, one\r\n_Arbogad_ by Name, having been an Eye-Witness from his Window, of\r\nthe Intrepidity and surprising Exploits of _Zadig_, took a Fancy to\r\nhim. He ran down therefore in Haste, and giving Orders himself to\r\nhis Vassals to desist, deliver'd the two Travellers out of their\r\nHands. Whatever Goods or Chattels, said he, come upon my\r\nTerritories, are my Effects; and whatever I find likewise that is\r\nvaluable upon the Premises of others, is my free Booty; but, as you\r\nappear, Sir, to me to be a Gentleman of uncommon Courage, you shall\r\nprove an Exception to my general Rule. Upon this, he invited _Zadig_\r\ninto his magnificent Mansion, giving his inferior Officers strict\r\nOrders to use him with all due Respect; and at Night _Arbogad_ was\r\ndesirous of supping with _Zadig_. The Lord of the Mansion was one of\r\nthose _Arabians_, that are call'd _Free-booters_; but a Man who now\r\nand then did good Actions amongst a Thousand bad ones. He plunder'd\r\nwithout Mercy; but was liberal in his Benefactions. When in Action,\r\nintrepid; but in Traffick, easy enough; a perfect _Epicure_ in his\r\nEating and Drinking, an absolute _Debauchee_, but very frank and\r\nopen. _Zadig_ pleas'd him extremely; his Conversation being very\r\nlively, prolong'd their Repast: At last, _Arbogad_ said to him; I\r\nwould advise you, Sir, to enlist yourself in my Troop; you cannot\r\npossibly do a better Thing: My Profession is none of the worst; and\r\nin Time, you may become perhaps as great a Man as myself. May I\r\npresume, Sir, to ask you one Question; how long may you have\r\nfollow'd this honourable Calling? From my Youth upwards, replied his\r\nHost, I was only a _Valet_ at first to an _Arabian_, who indeed was\r\ncourteous enough; but Servitude was a State of Life I could not\r\nbrook. It made me stark-mad to see, in a wide World, which ought to\r\nbe divided fairly between Mankind, that Fate had reserv'd for me so\r\nscanty a Portion. I communicated my Grievance to an old Sage\r\n_Arabian_. Son, said he, never despair; once upon a Time, there was\r\na Grain of Sand, that bemoan'd itself, as being nothing more than a\r\nworthless _Atom_ of the Deserts. At the Expiration, however, of a\r\nfew Years, it became that inestimable Diamond, which at this very\r\nHour, is the richest, and most admir'd Ornament of the _Indian_\r\nCrown. The old Man's Discourse fir'd me with some Ambition; I was\r\nconscious to myself that I was at that Time the _Atom_ he mention'd,\r\nbut was determin'd, if possible, to become the _Diamond_. At my\r\nfirst setting out, I stole two Horses; then I got into a Gang; where\r\nwe play'd at small Game, and stopp'd the small Caravans; thus I\r\ngradually lessen'd the wide Disproportion, which there was at first\r\nbetween me and the rest of Mankind: I enjoy'd not only my full Share\r\nof the good Things of this Life, but enjoy'd them with Usury. I was\r\nlook'd upon as a Man of Consequence, and I procur'd this Castle by\r\nmy military Atchievements. The _Satrap_ of _Syria_ had Thoughts of\r\ndispossessing me; but I was then too rich to be any Ways afraid of\r\nhim; I gave the _Satrap_ a certain Sum of Money, upon Condition that\r\nI kept quiet Possession of my Castle. And, moreover, I aggrandiz'd\r\nmy Domains; for he constituted me, at the same Time, Treasurer of\r\nthe Imports that _Arabia Petraea_ paid to the King of Kings. I\r\nexecuted my Trust, in every Respect, as I ought, in the Capacity of\r\na Collector; but I never did, nor never intended to balance my\r\nAccounts.\r\n\r\nThe grand _Desterham_ of _Babylon_ sent hither, in the Name of the\r\nKing _Moabdar_, a petty _Satrap_, with a Commission to strangle me.\r\nHe and his Attendants arriv'd here with his Royal Warrant. I was\r\nappriz'd of the whole Affair, and, accordingly, order'd his whole\r\nRetinue, consisting of four inferior Officers, to be strangled\r\nbefore his Face, after the same Manner as was intended for my\r\nExecution. After this, I ask'd him what he thought the Commission\r\nwith which he was entrusted, might reasonably be valued at; he\r\nanswer'd, that he presum'd his Premium (had he succeeded) might have\r\namounted to about three Hundred Pieces of Gold. I made him sensible,\r\nthat it would be for his Interest to be a commission'd Officer under\r\nme; I made him accordingly Deputy _Free-booter_. He is at this very\r\nDay not only the best Officer, but the richest I have in all my\r\nCourt. If my Word may be credited, I'll raise your Fortune as I have\r\ndone his. Never was Trade brisker in our Way; for _Moabdar_, is\r\nknock'd on the Head, and all _Babylon_ in the utmost Confusion.\r\n_Moabdar_ kill'd, said you! cry'd _Zadig_, and pray, Sir, what is\r\nbecome of his Royal Consort, _Astarte_? I know nothing at all of\r\nthat Affair, replied _Arbogad_, all that I have to say, is, that\r\n_Moabdar_ became a perfect Madman, and had his Brains beat out; that\r\nall the People in _Babylon_ are cutting one another's Throats, and\r\nthat the whole Empire is laid waste; that there is still an\r\nOpportunity for making several bold Pushes; and let me tell you,\r\nSir, I have done my Part, and made the most on't. But the Queen,\r\nSir, said _Zadig_; pray favour me so far, as to inform me, if you\r\nknow any Thing of the Queen. I have heard great Talk, said he, of a\r\ncertain Prince of _Hyrcania_; 'tis very possible, she may have\r\nlisted herself amongst his Concubines, if she had the good Fortune\r\nto escape the Resentment of those popular Tumults; but my Head, Sir,\r\nis better turn'd for the Highway than for News; I have taken several\r\nLadies Prisoners in the Course of my Excursions; I keep none of them\r\nfor my Part; and as to such as are handsomer than ordinary, I make\r\nthe best Market I can of them, without enquiring who they are. Their\r\nQuality or Titles will fetch no Price at all; a Queen, if she be\r\nhomely, is worth nothing. 'Tis probable, Sir, I have dispos'd of the\r\nLady myself; and 'tis possible, likewise, she may be dead; 'tis no\r\nConcern of mine; and to my thinking, it should be an Affair of no\r\nManner of Importance to you. After this Declaration, he drank so\r\nhard, and confounded his Ideas in such a Manner, that _Zadig_ was\r\nnot one whit the wiser. Upon which he was struck dumb, confounded,\r\nand stood as motionless as a Statue. _Arbogad_, in the mean while,\r\nswill'd down whole Bumpers, told a Hundred merry Tales, and swore a\r\nthousand Times over, that he was the happiest Creature upon God's\r\nEarth; persuading _Zadig_ to be as merry, and thoughtless as\r\nhimself. At last, being gradually overcome by the Fumes of his\r\nLiquor, he fell fast asleep. _Zadig_ spent the Remainder of the\r\nNight in deep Contemplation, and in all the Uneasiness of Mind\r\nimaginable. What, said he, the King first became crazy, and then was\r\nmurder'd. I think I have just Grounds for Complaint. The whole\r\nEmpire is in Confusion, and torn to Pieces, and this Free-booter is\r\nas happy as a King. O Fortune! O Fate! a Highwayman as happy as a\r\nMonarch! and the most amiable Creature that Nature ever fram'd has\r\nsuffer'd perhaps, an ignominious Death, or perhaps, is in a State of\r\nLife a thousand Times worse than Death itself! O _Astarte! Astarte!_\r\nWhat art thou become?\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was Break of Day he went out, and ask'd every one he\r\nsaw if they knew any Thing of her: But the whole Gang were too\r\nintent upon other Matters, to return him any Answer. By Virtue of\r\ntheir Night's Excursions, they had brought in some fresh Booty, and\r\nwere busy in dividing the Spoil. All the Favour he could procure, in\r\ntheir Hurry and Tumult, was, to go away without the least\r\nExamination. He took the Advantage of their Remissness, and mov'd\r\noff the Premises, but more overwhelm'd with Grief and deep\r\nReflection than ever.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_, in his March, was very restless and uneasy. His Thoughts\r\nwere forever rolling on the unfortunate _Astarte_, the King of\r\n_Babylon_, his Bosom-Friend _Cador_, the happy _Free-booter_,\r\n_Arbogad_, the fair _Coquet_, that was taken Prisoner on the\r\nConfines of _Egypt_, by the _Babylonish_ Courier; in a Word, on the\r\nvarious Scenes of Misfortunes and Disappointments, which he had\r\nsuccessively met with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\n_The_ FISHERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen _Zadig_ had travelled some few Leagues from _Arbogad's_ Castle,\r\nhe found himself arriv'd at the Banks of a little River; incessantly\r\ndeploring, as he went along, his unhappy Fate, and looking upon\r\nhimself as the very Picture of ill Luck. He perceiv'd at a little\r\nDistance a Fisherman, reclin'd on a verdant Bank by the River-side,\r\ntrembling, scarce able to hold his Net in his Hand, (which he seem'd\r\nbut little to regard) and with uplift Eyes, imploring Heaven's\r\nAssistance. I am, doubtless, said the poor Fisherman, the most\r\nunhappy Wretch that ever liv'd! No Merchant in all _Babylon_, it is\r\nvery well known, was ever so noted for selling Cream-Cheeses as\r\nmyself; and yet I am ruin'd to all Intents and Purposes. No Man of\r\nmy Profession ever had a handsomer, more compleat Housewife, than my\r\nDame was; but I have been treacherously depriv'd of her. I had still\r\nleft a poor, pitiful Cottage, but that I saw plunder'd and\r\ndestroy'd. I am cubb'd up here in a Cell; I have nothing to depend\r\nupon but my Fishery, and not one single Fish have I caught. Thou\r\nunfortunate Net! I'll never throw thee into the Water more: Much\r\nsooner will I throw myself in. No sooner were the Words out of his\r\nMouth, but he started up, and ran to the River-side, like one that\r\nwas resolutely bent to plunge in, and get rid of a miserable Life at\r\nonce. Is it possible, said _Zadig_? Is there then the Man in Being\r\nmore wretched than myself? His Benevolence, and good Will to save\r\nthe poor Man's Life, was as quick as the Reflection he had just\r\nmade! He ran to his Assistance; he laid hold of him; and ask'd him,\r\nwith an Air of Pity and Concern, the Cause of his rash Intention.\r\n'Tis an old saying, that a Person is less unhappy when he sees\r\nhimself not singular in Misfortune. But if we will credit\r\n_Zoroaster_, this is not from a Principle of Malignity, but the\r\nEffect of a fatal Necessity. He was attracted, as it were, to any\r\nPerson in Distress, as being One in the same unhappy Circumstances.\r\nThe Transport of a happy Man, would be a Kind of Insult; but two\r\nPersons in bad Circumstances, are like two weak Shrubs, which, by\r\npropping up each other, are fenc'd against a Storm. Why are you thus\r\ncast down, said _Zadig_ to the Fisherman? Never sink Man, under the\r\nWeight of your Burden. I can't help it, said the poor Fisherman; I\r\nhave not the least Prospect of Redress. I was once, Sir, the tip-top\r\nMan of the whole Village of _Derlbach_, near _Babylon_, where I\r\nliv'd, and with the Help of my Wife, made the best Cream-Cheeses\r\nthat were ever eaten in the _Persian_ Empire. Her Majesty, the Queen\r\n_Astarte_, and the famous Prime-Minister _Zadig_ were very fond of\r\nthem. I serv'd the Court with about six Hundred of them, I went the\r\nother Day in Hopes of being paid; but before I had well got into the\r\nSuburbs of _Babylon_, I was inform'd, that not only the Queen, but\r\n_Zadig_ too had privately left the Court: Whereupon I ran directly\r\nto _Zadig's_ House, tho' I never sat Eye on the Man in all my Life.\r\nThere I found the Court-Marshals of the grand _Desterham_,\r\nplundering, by Virtue of his Majesty's Mandate, all his Effects, in\r\nthe most loyal Manner. From thence I made the best of my Way to the\r\nQueen's Kitchin; where, applying my self to the Steward of her\r\nHousehold, and his inferior Officers; one of them told me she was\r\ndead; another, that she was confin'd in Prison; a third, indeed,\r\nsaid that she had made her Escape by Flight; all in general,\r\nhowever, assur'd me for my Comfort, that my Cheeses would never be\r\npaid for. From thence I went, with my Wife in my Hand, to Lord\r\n_Orcan's_; who was another of my Court-Customers; of whom we begg'd\r\nfor Shelter and Protection: The Favour, I confess, was readily\r\ngranted to my Wife; but as for my own Part, I was absolutely\r\nrejected. She was fairer, Sir, than the fairest Cheese I ever sold;\r\nfrom whence I date all my Misfortunes; and the red that adorn'd her\r\nblushing Cheeks was ten Times more lively than any _Tyrian_ Scarlet.\r\nAnd between you and I, Sir, that was the main Cause of my Wife's\r\nReception, and my Disgrace. Whereupon I wrote a doleful Letter to my\r\nWife, in all the Agonies of one in the deepest Despair: 'Tis very\r\nwell, said she, to the Messenger; I have some little Knowledge of\r\nthe Man; I have heard say no one sells better Cream-Cheeses than he\r\ndoes; desire him, next Time he comes, to bring a small Parcel with\r\nhim, and let him know, I'll take care he shall be punctually paid.\r\n\r\nIn the Height of my Misfortunes, I determin'd to seek Redress in a\r\nCourt of Equity: I had but six Ounces of Gold left: Two whereof went\r\nfor a Fee to my Counsellor; two to my Lawyer, who took my Cause in\r\nHand, and the other two to the Judge's Clerk. Notwithstanding what I\r\nhad done, my Cause was not so much as commenc'd; and I had already\r\ndisburs'd more Money than all my Cheeses and my Wife with them were\r\nworth. I return'd therefore to my Native Habitation, with a full\r\nResolution to sell it for the Ransom of my Wife.\r\n\r\nMy little Cot, with the Appurtenances, were worth about threescore\r\nOunces of Gold: But as the Purchasers found I was necessitous, and\r\ndrove to my last Shifts; the first whom I apply'd to, offer'd me\r\nthirty Ounces; the second, twenty; and the third, but ten: Just as I\r\nhad come to Terms of Accommodation with one of them, the Prince of\r\n_Hyrcania_ came to _Babylon_, and swept all before him. My little\r\nCottage, with all its Furniture, was first plunder'd of all that was\r\nvaluable, and at last reduc'd to Ashes.\r\n\r\nHaving thus lost my Money, my Wife, and my House, I withdrew to this\r\nDesart, where you see me. I have since endeavour'd to get my Bread\r\nby Fishing; but the Fish, as well as all Mankind, desert me. I\r\nscarce catch one in a Day; I am half starv'd; and had it not been\r\nfor your unexpected Benevolence and Generosity, I had been at the\r\nBottom of the River before this.\r\n\r\nThis long Detail of Particulars, however, was not deliver'd without\r\nseveral Interruptions; for, said _Zadig_, with Abundance of Warmth\r\nand Confusion, Have you never heard, Sir, of what is become of the\r\nQueen _Astarte_? No Sir, not I, said the disconsolate Fisherman; but\r\nthis I know, to my Sorrow, that neither the Queen, nor _Zadig_, ever\r\npaid me the least Consideration in the World for my Cream Cheeses;\r\nthat my dear Spouse is taken from me; and that I am drove to the\r\nvery Brink of Despair. I am verily persuaded, said _Zadig_, that you\r\nwill not lose all your Money. I have heard much talk of that same\r\n_Zadig_; they say he is very honest, and that if ever he returns to\r\n_Babylon_, as 'tis to be hop'd he will, he'll discharge his Debts\r\nwith Interest, like a Man of Honour. But, as for your Wife, who\r\nappears to me, to be no better than a Wag-tail, never take the\r\nTrouble, if you'll take my Advice, to hunt after her any more. Be\r\nrul'd, and make the best of your Way to _Babylon_. I shall be there\r\nbefore you, as I shall ride, and you will be on Foot. Make your\r\nApplications to the illustrious _Cador_; tell him you met his Friend\r\nupon the Road; and stay there still I come. Observe my Orders, and\r\n'tis very probable it may turn out to your Advantage.\r\n\r\nO puissant _Orosmades_, continu'd he, you have made me, 'tis true,\r\nan Instrument of Comfort to this poor Man; but what Friend will you\r\nraise for me, to alleviate my Sorrows? Having utter'd this short\r\nExpostulation, he gave the distrest Fisherman one full Moiety of all\r\nthe Money he brought with him out of _Arabia_. The Fisherman,\r\nthunder-struck, and transported with Joy at so unexpected a\r\nBenefaction, kiss'd the Feet of _Cador's_ Friend, and cried out,\r\nsure you are a Messenger of Heaven, sent down to be my Saviour!\r\n\r\nIn the mean Time, _Zadig_ every now and then ask'd him Questions,\r\nand wept as he ask'd them. What! Sir, said the Fisherman, can you,\r\nwho are so bountiful a Benefactor, be in Distress yourself? Alas!\r\nsaid he, Friend, I am a hundred Times more unhappy than thou art.\r\nBut pray, Sir, said the good Man, how can it possibly be, that he,\r\nwho is so lavish of his Favours, should be overwhelm'd with greater\r\nMisfortunes than the Man he so generously relieves? Your greatest\r\nUneasiness, said he, arose from the Narrowness of your Circumstances;\r\nbut mine proceeds from an internal, and much deeper Cause. Pray, Sir,\r\nsaid the Fisherman, has _Orcan_ robb'd you of your Wife? This\r\nInterrogatory put _Zadig_ in a Moment upon a Retrospection of all his\r\npast Adventures. He recollected the whole Series of his Misfortunes;\r\ncommencing from that of the Eunuch and the Huntsman, to his Arrival\r\nat the Free-booter's Castle. Alas! said he, to the Fisherman,\r\n_Orcan_, 'tis true, deserves severely to be punish'd: But for the\r\nGenerality, we find, such worthless Barbarians are the Favourites of\r\nFortune. Be that, however, as it will, go as I bade you, to my Friend\r\n_Cador_, and wait there till I come. They took their Leave; the\r\nFisherman blessing his propitious Stars, and _Zadig_ cursing, every\r\nStep he went, the Hour he was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\n_The_ BASILISK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs _Zadig_ was traversing a verdant Meadow, he perceiv'd several\r\nyoung Female _Syrians_, intent on searching for something very\r\ncurious, that lay conceal'd, as they imagin'd, in the Grass. He took\r\nthe Freedom to approach one of them, and ask her, in the most\r\ncourteous Manner, if he might have the Honour to assist her in her\r\nResearches. Have a care, said she. What we are hunting after, Sir,\r\nis an Animal, that will not suffer itself to be touch'd by a Man.\r\n'Tis somewhat surprizing, said _Zadig_. May I be so bold, pray, as\r\nto ask you what you are in Pursuit after, that shuns the Touch of\r\nany Thing but the Hands of the Fair Sex. 'Tis, Sir, said she, the\r\n_Basilisk_: A _Basilisk_, Madam, said he! And pray, if you will be\r\nso good as to inform me, with what View, are you searching after a\r\nCreature so very difficult to be met with? 'Tis, Sir, said she, for\r\nour Lord and Master _Ogul_, whose Castle, you see, situate on the\r\nRiver-side, at the Bottom of the Meadow. We are all his Vassals.\r\n_Ogul_, you must know, is in a very bad State of Health, and his\r\nfirst Physician has order'd him, as a Specific, to eat a _Basilisk_,\r\nboil'd in Rose water: And as that Animal is very hard to be catch'd,\r\nand will suffer nothing to approach it, but one of our Sex, our\r\ndying Sovereign _Ogul_ has promis'd to honour her, that shall be so\r\nhappy as to catch it for him, so far as to make her his Consort. The\r\nCase, being thus circumstantiated, Sir, I hope you will not\r\ninterrupt me any longer, lest my Rivals here in the Field should\r\nhappen to circumvent me.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ withdrew, and left the _Syrian_ Ladies in Quest of their\r\nimaginary Booty, in order to pursue his intended Journey. But as he\r\ncame to the Banks of a Rivulet, at the remotest part of the Meadow,\r\nhe perceiv'd another young Lady, reclin'd on the Grass, and entirely\r\ndisengag'd. Her Stature seem'd majestic, but her Face was cover'd\r\nwith a Vail; and her Eyes were fixt, as one at her Looking-glass, on\r\nthe River. Every now and then a Sigh burst out, as if her Heart were\r\nbreaking. In her Hand she held a little Wand or Rod, with which she\r\nwas tracing out some Characters on the dry Sand, that lay between\r\nthe flow'ry Bank she sat on, and the purling Current. _Zadig's_\r\nCuriosity induc'd him, unperceiv'd, to observe her Operations at\r\nsome Distance. But approaching nearer, and perceiving very\r\ndistinctly the first Character to be an _Z_. the next an _A_. and\r\nthe third a _D_. he started; but when he saw the additional Capitals\r\nof _I_ and _G_. his Astonishment was too great for Words to express.\r\nHe stood for some Time perfectly thunder-struck, and as motionless\r\nas a Statue; At last, in a soft, faultring Tone, he broke Silence: O\r\ngenerous Lady, said he, forgive a Stranger, one overwhelm'd with\r\nSorrows like yourself, if he asks you, by what amazing Accident he\r\nfinds the Name of _Zadig_ delineated by so angelick a Hand. Thus\r\nunexpectedly interrupted, and at the Sound of those Words, she\r\nturn'd her Head; and with a trembling Hand, lifting up her Vail, she\r\nespy'd _Zadig_ himself. Upon which, she shriek'd; and as her Heart\r\nwas flutter'd between the two Extreams of Transport and Surprize,\r\nshe fainted away, and gently dropp'd into his Arms. 'Twas, it seems\r\n_Astarte_ her self; 'twas the Queen of _Babylon_; 'twas the very\r\n_Goddess_ whom _Zadig_ ador'd; 'twas, in short, the very identical\r\nLady, whose hard Fate he had so long deplor'd; and for whose sake he\r\nhad felt so many agonizing Pains. For a few Minutes he stood\r\nspeechless, and depriv'd, as it were, of all his senses, whilst his\r\nEyes were fixt on his _Astarte_, who began to revive; and cast a\r\nwishful Glance at him, attended with some Confusion. O ye immortal\r\nPowers, cried he, who preside over the Destiny of us frail Mortals!\r\nYe have restor'd me my _Astarte_; but alas! at what a Conjuncture,\r\nin what a Place, and in what a State and Condition do I view her? He\r\nthrew himself prostrate on the Ground, and kiss'd the Dust of her\r\nFeet. The Queen of _Babylon_ rais'd him up, and oblig'd him to sit\r\nby her on the flow'ry Bank whereon she was repos'd. Every now and\r\nthen she wip'd her Eyes, as the Tears trickl'd down afresh her\r\nlovely Cheeks. Twenty times she endeavour'd to renew her Discourse;\r\nbut was interrupted by her Sighs; she ask'd him over and over to\r\nrelate to her the Hardships he had ran thro' since their parting,\r\nand by what Chance he came to traverse that solitary Meadow; but\r\nprevented him at the same Time from returning any Answer, by\r\nrepeating Question upon Question. At last, she gave him a particular\r\nDetail of her own Misfortunes, and again requested to know his. Both\r\nof them, in short, having, in some Measure, appeas'd the Tumult of\r\ntheir Souls; _Zadig_, in a few Words, inform'd her of the Motives\r\nthat brought him thither.\r\n\r\nBut tell me, O unfortunate, tho' ever-venerable Queen, how I came to\r\nfind you out, reclining on this verdant Bank, dress'd in this\r\nservile Habit, accompanied by other Female Slaves, who, I find, have\r\nbeen all Day long in Quest after a _Basilisk_, which, as I\r\nunderstand, is by Order of a celebrated Physician, to be dissolv'd\r\nin Rose-water, as a specific Medicine for his dying Patient.\r\n\r\nWhilst they busy in their fruitless Search, said the beauteous\r\n_Astarte_, I'll tell you the whole Series of Sorrows which I have\r\nundergone since last we parted; and since Heav'n has thus\r\nunexpectedly blest my Eyes once more with the Sight of my dear\r\n_Zadig_, I'll no longer exclaim against my impropitious Stars.\r\n\r\nYou are not insensible, that the jealous King my Spouse, was\r\ndisgusted to find you the most amiable of all Mortals, and that for\r\nno other Reason he determin'd to strangle you, and poison me. You\r\nknow very well too, that indulgent Heav'n inspir'd, as it were, my\r\nlittle Dwarf, with artful Means to give me timely Notice of the rash\r\nResolutions of the King, my cruel Husband.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the faithful _Cador_ oblig'd you to obey my Orders, and\r\nto fly the Court, but he ventur'd to enter my Apartment in the Dead\r\nof Night thro' a private Door. He snatch'd me up, and convey'd me\r\ndirectly into the Temple of _Orosmades_, where the holy _Magus_, who\r\nwas his Brother, lock'd me up in that august and awful Statue, that\r\nstands erect upon the Pavement of the Temple, and _Colossus_-like,\r\ntouches the lofty Ceiling with his Head. There I lay conceal'd, or\r\nrather buried for some Time; tho' taken all imaginable Care of, and\r\nfurnish'd with all the Necessaries of Life by that venerable, and\r\nloyal Priest. In the mean Time, his Apothecary enter'd at Break of\r\nDay into my Apartment, with a Potion in his Hand, compos'd of Opium,\r\nblack Hellebore, Aconite, and other Ingredients still more baneful.\r\nWhilst this mercenary Officer of the King's Vengeance was thus\r\nemploy'd, another as inhuman as himself, went to your Lodgings with\r\nthe silken Cord. Both, however, were disappointed, as both of us\r\nwere fled. _Cador_, very officious, flew to the King, in order the\r\nmore artfully to blind him; and in a feign'd Passion, rail'd at us\r\nboth, and charg'd us both as perfidious Traitors. As for that\r\nVillain _Zadig_, said he, he has taken his Flight towards _India_;\r\nand your false, ungrateful Consort, Sire, said he, is fled to\r\n_Memphis_. The Guards were order'd that Moment to pursue us both.\r\n\r\nThe Couriers, who flew after me, knew nothing of me. I had never\r\nexpos'd my Face unveil'd to any one but your self, and that too in\r\nthe Presence, and by the express Order of my Royal Master. As they\r\nhad no other Marks to distinguish me from others but my Stature, as\r\nit had been describ'd, a young Lady, just of my Size, but in all\r\nProbability much more handsome, presented herself to their View, on\r\nthe Frontiers of _Egypt_. She was found alone, and in a very\r\ndisconsolate Condition. This Lady must, doubtless, said they to\r\nthemselves, be the Queen of _Babylon_: And without listning to her\r\nComplaints, convey'd her instantly to my Husband _Moabdar_. Their\r\ngross Blunder at first incens'd his Majesty to the last Degree; but\r\nafter he had view'd the Lady with an attentive Eye, he found she was\r\nextremely pretty, and was soon pacify'd. Her Name was _Missouf_. I\r\nhave been since inform'd, that her Name in the _Egyptian_ Language\r\nsignifies the _Fair Coquet_. And in Effect, she was so: She had as\r\nmuch Art, however, as Caprice. For she pleas'd the King of Kings: In\r\nshort, she had such an Ascendancy over him, that he didn't scruple\r\nin publick to own her as his Wife. When she had secur'd him thus far\r\nin her Toils, she never conceal'd her Power, but play'd the Part of\r\na perfect Humourist. She indulg'd herself in every Whim that came in\r\nher Head, without Fear of being brow-beat. In the first Place, She\r\ninsisted that the Chief Magus, who was old and gouty, should dance a\r\nSaraband before her; and upon his modest Refusal to comply with so\r\npreposterous a Request, she persecuted him without Mercy: Nothing\r\nwould serve her Turn, in the next Place, but his Majesty's grand\r\nMaster of the Horse must make her a Minc'd-pye. The Gentleman took\r\nthe Liberty to let her know, that he was no profess'd Cook; a Tart,\r\nhowever, he must make for her, and she got him turn'd out of his\r\nPlace for being so monstrously careless, as to burn one _Corner_ of\r\nthe Crust. Whereupon she gave his Post to her favourite Dwarf, and\r\nmade her Fop of a Page the Keeper of his Majesty's great Seal, and\r\nConfidence. Thus she reign'd arbitrary, and was the Female Tyrant of\r\n_Babylon_. All the World deplor'd the Loss of me their former Queen.\r\nThe King, who never acted the Part of a Tyrant, till the Moment he\r\nwould have imprison'd me, and strangled you, seem'd to have drown'd\r\nall his good Qualities in his Dotage on that capricious Enchantress.\r\nHe came to the Temple on the solemn Festival of the sacred Fire. I\r\nsaw him prostrate on the Pavement before the Statue, wherein I was\r\nenclos'd, imploring the Gods to show'r down their choicest Blessings\r\non his beauteous _Missouf_. I, with an audible and distinct, but\r\nhollow Tone, address'd my self thus, like an Oracle, to the King of\r\nKings. _The Gods reject the Vows of a Monarch, that acts the Tyrant\r\no'er his Subjects; One, who could think of murdering an innocent\r\nWife; and admit of a worthless Beauty to supply her Place._\r\n_Moabdar_ was so startled at this unexpected Answer from the God he\r\nador'd, that he was just at the Point of Distraction. The Oracle\r\nthat I had deliver'd, and the tyrannical Proceedings of his new\r\nSpouse _Missouf_, were enough to deprive him of his Senses. In\r\nshort, in a few Days he became a perfect Mad-man. Her Caprice, which\r\nseem'd a Judgement from above, portended a sudden Revolution. His\r\nSubjects accordingly revolted, and were instantly up in Arms.\r\n_Babylon_, that had so long indulg'd herself in Indolence and Ease,\r\nbecame the Seat, or Theatre of a bloody Civil War. Whereupon I was\r\ntaken from my magnificent Prison, the Bowels of his God, and set up\r\nat the Head of a very powerful Party. Your Friend _Cador_ flew to\r\n_Memphis_ in hopes to find you there, and bring you back to\r\n_Babylon_. The Prince of _Hyrcania_, hearing of these intestine\r\nBroils, return'd with a powerful Army, in order to form a third\r\nParty, among the _Babylonians_. He attack'd the King, who fled with\r\nhis fair, but fickle _Egyptian_ before him. _Moabdar_, however, was\r\nso closely pursu'd, that he dy'd of the Wounds he receiv'd in his\r\nRetreat. _Missouf_ became the fair Victim of the Conqueror. As for\r\nmy own Part, I had the Misfortune to be over-power'd likewise, and\r\ntaken Prisoner by an _Hyrcanian Party_, who brought me into the\r\nPresence of the young Prince, at the very Juncture when _Missouf_\r\nstood before him. You'll smile, doubtless, when I tell you the\r\nPrince look'd upon me as the most amiable Captive of the two; but\r\nthen, I presume you will be sorry to hear, that my hard Fate doom'd\r\nme to be a Vassal in his Seraglio. He told me, in direct Terms, that\r\nas soon as he had put an happy Issue to one Military Expedition,\r\nwhich would not, he flatter'd himself, be long unexecuted, he would\r\nhonour me with a Visit. Judge the dreadful Apprehensions I was\r\nunder, upon his making such a peremptory Declaration. My Obligations\r\nto _Moabdar_ were all cancell'd, and I was free to be the Bride of\r\n_Zadig_; but instead of that, I fell into the Toils of a\r\n_Barbarian_. I answer'd him with all the Resentment becoming one of\r\nmy high Character and unspotted Virtue. I had always heard say, that\r\nHeav'n bestow'd on Persons of my Rank, such a peculiar Mark of\r\nMajesty and Grandeur, that with a bare Word, or the Glance of an\r\nangry Eye, they could bring down, and abase the Pride of those\r\naudacious Creatures that durst to thwart their Inclinations. I\r\ntalk'd as big as a Queen; but I was treated like the most servile\r\nDomestic. The saucy _Hyrcanian_, without so much as vouchsafing me\r\none Single Word, turn'd to his black Eunuch, and told him that I was\r\nvery impertinent; but yet he could not help thinking I was very\r\npretty. He gave him therefore particular Orders to take care of me,\r\nand put me under the same Regimen, with respect to my Diet, as one\r\nof his Favourites, in order that I might recover my Colour, which\r\nwas somewhat too languid; in a Word, that I might become worthy in a\r\nlittle Time of his Royal Favours, and be duely qualified to receive\r\nhim, when he should honour me so far as to fix the Day. I told him,\r\nI would die first: He replied, with a Sneer, that young Ladies, like\r\nme, seldom kill'd themselves, and that they were made for Enjoyment;\r\nand then turn'd upon his Heel, with as careless an Air, as a Man\r\nwould part with his Paroquet, when he had shut her up close in her\r\ngilded Cage. What a shocking State was I in for the first Queen of\r\nthe Universe! Nay, I'll say more, for a Heart that was wholly\r\ndevoted to her _Zadig_!\r\n\r\nAt these endearing Words, _Zadig_ threw himself at her Feet, and\r\nbath'd them with his Tears. _Astarte_ immediately rais'd him in the\r\nmost courteous and engaging Manner, and thus continu'd her\r\nNarration.--I too plainly perceiv'd, that I was subject to the\r\nTyranny of a _Barbarian_, and the Rival of a Coquet, that was a\r\nSlave like myself. She related to me all her past Adventures in\r\n_Egypt_. From the Description she gave of her Gallant, the Time and\r\nPlace, the Dromedary he was mounted on, and from every other minute\r\nCircumstance, I imagin'd it was your self that play'd the Hero in\r\nher Favour. As I made no Doubt but that you resided somewhere in\r\n_Memphis_, I determin'd to go thither my self, but in Disguise.\r\nBeauteous _Missouf_, said I, you are of a much sprightlier\r\nDisposition than I am; you will be able to amuse the gay young\r\nPrince of _Hyrcania_ a thousand Times better than I shall. Find out\r\nsome Way therefore for my Escape; by which you will be sole Lady\r\nRegent. You will oblige me to the last Degree, by your friendly\r\nAssistance, and at the same Time get rid of a Rival. _Missouf_,\r\n(cajol'd with the Hint) came into my Measures directly. She took\r\ncare to send me packing forthwith, with no other Attendant than an\r\nold _Egyptian_ Slave.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I reach'd the Borders of _Arabia_, but a notorious\r\nFree-booter, (one _Arbogad_ by Name) pick'd me up, as I was\r\nstrolling along, and sold me to some Merchants, who convey'd me to\r\nyonder Castle, the magnificent Residence of the Emir _Ogul_. He\r\npurchas'd me at all Adventures, without enquiring what, or who I\r\nwas. He is a perfect Debauchee; his sole Delight lies in good\r\nEating, Wine, and Women; and is one, who imagines, that the Almighty\r\nsent him into the World for no other Purpose but to gratify his\r\nunruly Appetites. He is excessively fat, and puffs and blows every\r\nMoment, like one half choak'd. When he has gorg'd himself so\r\nunmercifully that he is ready to burst, his chief Physician can\r\npersuade him to take any Thing for his Relief; tho' he laughs at\r\nhim, and despises his Advice when he's well and sober. He has\r\nintimated to him, that at present his Life's in Danger, and nothing\r\nwill restore him but a _Basilisk_, boil'd in Rose-Water. Whereupon\r\nthe grand _Ogul_ has promis'd his last Favours to that Slave,\r\nwhoever she be, that shall be so fortunate as to catch a _Basilisk_,\r\nfor him, since it seems they are so seldom to be met with. You see I\r\nhave others to struggle for the Honour propos'd, and I never had a\r\nless Inclination to find out this _Basilisk_ than at present, since\r\nI have once more met with my dearest _Zadig_.\r\n\r\nAfter this Declaration, _Astarte_ and _Zadig_ renew'd with Warmth\r\nthe virtuous Affection which they had long conceiv'd for each other;\r\nand reciprocally utter'd all the tenderest Expressions that Love in\r\nDistress could possibly devise. And the _Genii_, who preside over\r\nall the soft Passions, wafted their mutual Vows of eternal Constancy\r\nand Truth to the Sphere of _Venus_.\r\n\r\nThe whole Train of Slaves, after a long fruitless Search, attended\r\non _Ogul_, to inform him that all their strictest Search was\r\nfruitless. _Zadig_ desired that he might have the Honour to be\r\nintroduc'd into his Presence. Accordingly he was, and his Address\r\nwas to this or the like Effect. May immortal Health descend from\r\nHeaven to preserve a Life, Sir, so precious as yours is. I am a\r\nPhysician by Profession. I flew to your Palace, on the first News of\r\nthe dangerous Situation you were in, and have brought a _Basilisk_\r\nwith me, distill'd in Rose-Water. I can have no Hopes of the Honour\r\nof your Bed, in Case I succeed in my Application: All the Favour I\r\nrequest, is, the Release of one of your _Babylonish_ Slaves, who has\r\nbeen in your Highness's Retinue for some Time. And I am willing to\r\nbe your Bond-slave in her Stead, if I fail of restoring the most\r\nillustrious and magnificent _Ogul_ to his pristine State of Health.\r\n\r\nThe Proposition was readily embrac'd. _Astarte_ was instantly\r\ndischarg'd, and set out for _Babylon_, with a proper Attendant,\r\naccording to _Zadig's_ Direction; assuring her that she should hear\r\nevery Day, by a special Courier, of his Proceedings with his new\r\nPatient. The Farewel which they took of each other, was very\r\naffectionate and tender, expressive of the strongest Obligations to\r\neach other. The Moments of Meeting, and those of Parting, are (as it\r\nis written in the sacred Book of _Zend_) the two most remarkable\r\n_Epochas_ of a Lover's Life. _Zadig's_ repeated Protestations of\r\nAffection for the Queen were perfectly sincere, and the pure\r\nDictates of his Heart; and the Queen's Love for _Zadig_ had made a\r\ndeeper Impression on hers, than she thought proper to discover.\r\n\r\nIn the mean Time, _Zadig_, again addressing himself to _Ogul_, said;\r\nmy _Basilisk_, Sir, as others are, is not to be drest or eaten; but\r\nall its Virtues must penetrate your whole Fabrick, thro' your Pores;\r\nI have inclos'd my never-failing _Sudorific_ in a Bladder,\r\nfull-blown and carefully cover'd with the softest Leather. You must\r\nkick this Bladder, Sir, once a Day about your Hall for a whole Hour\r\ntogether, with all the Vigour and Activity you possibly can. This\r\nMedicine must be repeated every Morning, and I'll attend the\r\nOperation: Upon your due Observance of the Regimen I shall put you\r\nunder, I doubt not, but with the Blessing of Heav'n on my honest\r\nEndeavours, I shall give you ample Demonstration of my being an\r\nAdept in Physick. _Ogul_, upon making the first Experiment, was\r\nready to expire for want of Breath, and thought he should die with\r\nthe Fatigue. The second Day did not prove altogether so irksome, and\r\nhe slept much better at Night than he had done before. In short, our\r\nDoctor in about eight Days Time, perform'd an absolute Cure. His\r\nPatient was as brisk, active and gay, as One in the Bloom of his\r\nYouth.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, said _Zadig_, I'll be ingenuous with you, and disclose to\r\nyou the important Secret. You have play'd at Foot-ball these eight\r\nDays successively; and you have liv'd all that Time, within the\r\nBounds of Sobriety and Moderation. Know, Sir, that there is no such\r\nAnimal in Nature as a _Basilisk_; that Health is to be secur'd by\r\nTemperance and Exercise; and that the Art of making Health\r\nconsistent with Luxury, is altogether as impracticable, and an Art,\r\nin all Respects, as idle and chimerical, as those of the\r\nPhilosopher's Stone, judicial Astrology, or any other Reveries of\r\nthe like airy and fantastic Nature.\r\n\r\n_Ogul's_ Head-Physician, apprehensive that this unexpected Cure,\r\nthus wrought by a Stranger, through such an Anti-medicinal\r\nPreparation, might possibly not only render himself the Object of\r\nContempt in the Eye of his great Master, but cast a Kind of Slur in\r\ngeneral on his whole Fraternity, conven'd a Set of petty Doctors and\r\nApothecaries, who were his Vassals, and entirely devoted to his\r\nInterest, to find out some sure Ways and Means to cut off in private\r\nhis dreadful Rival; but whilst their wicked Plot was hatching,\r\n_Zadig_ receiv'd a Courier from the Queen _Astarte_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\n_The_ TOURNAMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen was receiv'd at _Babylon_ with all the Transports of Joy\r\nthat could possibly be express'd for the safe Return of so\r\nillustrious and so beautiful a Personage, that had run thro' such a\r\nlong Series of Misfortunes. _Babylon_ at that Time seem'd to be\r\nperfectly serene and quiet. As for the young Prince of _Hyrcania_,\r\nhe was slain in Battle. The _Babylonians_, who were the Victors,\r\ndeclar'd that _Astarte_ should marry that Candidate for the Crown,\r\nwho should gain it by a fair and impartial Election. They were\r\ndetermin'd, that the most valuable Post of Honour in the World,\r\nnamely, that of being the Royal Consort of _Astarte_, and the\r\nSovereign of _Babylon_, should be the Result of Merit only; and not\r\nbe procur'd by any Party-Factions or Court-Intrigues. A solemn Oath\r\nwas voluntarily taken by all Parties, that he who should distinguish\r\nhimself by his superior Valour and Wisdom, should unanimously be\r\nacknowledg'd the Sovereign-Elect.\r\n\r\nA spacious _List_, or _Circus_, was pitched upon, surrounded with\r\ncommodious Seats, erected in an Amphitheatrical Manner, and richly\r\nembellish'd some few Leagues from the City. Thither the Combatants,\r\nor Champions were to repair, compleatly accoutred. Each of them had\r\na distinct Apartment to himself behind the _Lists_, where no Soul\r\ncould either see them, or know who they were. They were to enter the\r\n_Lists_ four several Times. Those who were so happy as to conquer\r\nfour Competitors, were afterwards to engage each other in single\r\nCombat; in order that he who should remain Master of the Field\r\nshould be proclaim'd the happy Victor.\r\n\r\nFour Days afterwards, they were to meet again, accoutred as before,\r\nand to explain all such _AEnigmas_, or _Riddles_, as the _Magi_\r\nshould think proper to propose. If their Queries should prove too\r\nintricate and perplext for them to resolve, they were to have\r\nRecourse to the _Lists_ again, and after that, to fresh _AEnigmas_,\r\nbefore they could be entitled to the Election: So that the\r\n_Tournaments_ were to be continu'd till One of the Candidates should\r\nbe twice a Victor, and shine as conspicuous, with respect to his\r\ninternal Qualities, as to his Dexterity and Address in heroic\r\nAtchievements. The Queen, in the mean Time, was to be narrowly\r\nwatch'd, and allow'd only to be a Spectator of both their\r\nAmusements, at some considerable Distance; and moreover, to be\r\ncover'd with a Vail: Nor was she indulg'd so far as to speak one\r\nsingle Word to any Candidate whomsoever, in order to prevent the\r\nleast Jealousy or Suspicion either of Partiality or Injustice.\r\n\r\n_Astarte_ took care, by the Courier, to inform her Lover of all the\r\nPreliminary Articles abovemention'd, not doubting but that he would\r\nexert both his Courage and Understanding for her Sake, beyond any of\r\nthe other Competitors.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ accordingly set out for _Babylon_, and besought the Goddess\r\n_Venus_, not only to fortify his Courage, but to illuminate his Mind\r\nwith Wisdom on this important Occasion.\r\n\r\nThe Night before these martial Atchievements were to commence,\r\n_Zadig_ arrived upon the Banks of the _Euphrates_. He inscrib'd his\r\nDevice amongst the List of Combatants; concealing, at the same Time,\r\nboth his Person and Name, as the Laws of the Election required; and\r\naccordingly, withdrew to the Apartment that was provided for him,\r\naccording to his Lot.\r\n\r\n_Cador_, who was just return'd to _Babylon_, having hunted all\r\n_Egypt_ over to no Purpose, in Hopes to find his Friend _Zadig_,\r\nbrought a compleat set of Armour into his Lodge, by express Orders\r\nfrom the Queen: She sent him likewise One of the finest Horses in\r\nall _Persia_. _Zadig_ knew that these Presents could come from\r\nNo-body but his dear _Astarte_, which redoubled his Vigour and his\r\nHopes.\r\n\r\nThe next Morning the Queen being seated under a Canopy of State,\r\nenrich'd with precious Stones; and the Amphitheatres being crowded\r\nwith Gentlemen and Ladies of all Ranks and Conditions from\r\n_Babylon_; the Competitors made their personal Appearance in the\r\n_Circus_: Each of them went up to the grand _Magus_, and laid down\r\nhis particular _Device_ at his Feet. The _Devices_ were drawn by\r\nLot: That of _Zadig_ was the last. The first that advanc'd was a\r\nGrandee, one _Itabod_ by Name, immensely rich, indeed, and very\r\nhaughty; but no ways couragious; exceedingly awkward, and a Man of\r\nno acquir'd Parts. The Sycophants that hover'd round about him\r\nflatter'd him, that a Man of his Merit couldn't fail of being King:\r\nHe imperiously replied, One of my Merit must be King: Whereupon he\r\nwas arm'd _Cap-a-pee_. His Armour was made of pure Gold, enamell'd\r\nwith Green. The Housings of his Saddle were green, and his Lance\r\nembellish'd with green Ribbands. Every One was sensible, at first\r\nSight, by _Itobad's_ Manner of managing his Horse, that he was not\r\nthe Man whom Heav'n had pitch'd upon to sway the _Babylonish_\r\nScepter. The first Combatant that tilted with him, threw him out of\r\nthe Saddle; the second flung him quite over the Crupper, and laid\r\nhim sprawling on the Ground, with his Heels quiv'ring in the Air.\r\n_Itobad_, 'tis true, remounted, but with so ill a Grace, that an\r\nuniversal Laugh went round the Amphitheatre. The third, disdaining\r\nto use his Lance, made only a Feint at him: Then catch'd hold of his\r\nRight Leg, and whirling him round, threw him flat upon the Sand. The\r\nEsquires, who were the Attendants, ran to his Assistance, and with a\r\nSneer remounted him. The fourth Combatant catch'd hold of his Left\r\nLeg, and unhors'd him again. He was convey'd thro' the hissing\r\nMultitude to his Lodge, where, according to the Law in that Case\r\nprovided, he was to pass the Night. And as he hobbled along, said\r\nhe, to the Esquires, what a sad Misfortune is this to One of my\r\nBirth and Character!\r\n\r\nThe other Champions play'd their Parts much better; and all came off\r\nwith Credit. Some conquer'd two of their Antagonists, and others\r\nwere so far successful as to get the better of three. None of them,\r\nhowever, except Prince _Hottam_, vanquish'd four. _Zadig_, at last,\r\nenter'd the Lists, and dismounted all his four Opponents, one after\r\nthe other, with the utmost Ease, and with such an Air and Grace, as\r\ngain'd him universal Applause. As the Case stood thus, _Zadig_ and\r\n_Hottam_ were to close the Day's Entertainment in a single Combat.\r\nThe Armour of the latter was of a blue Colour mixt with Gold, and\r\nthe Housings of his Saddle were of the same. Those of the former\r\nwhite as Snow. The Multitude were divided in their Wishes. The\r\nKnight in blue was the Favourite of some of the Ladies; and others\r\nagain were Admirers of the Cavalier in white. The Queen, whose Heart\r\nwas in a perfect Palpitation, put up her secret Prayers to _Venus_\r\nto assist her darling Hero.\r\n\r\nThe two Champions making their Passes and their Volta's, with the\r\nutmost Dexterity and Address, and keeping firm in their Saddles,\r\ngave each other such Rebuffs with their Lances, that all the\r\nSpectators (the Queen only excepted) wish'd for two Kings of\r\n_Babylon_. At last, their Horses being tired, and both their Lances\r\nbroke, _Zadig_ made use of the following Stratagem, which his\r\nAntagonist wasn't any ways appriz'd of. He got artfully behind him,\r\nand shooting with a Spring on his Horses Buttocks, grasp'd him\r\nclose, threw him headlong on the Sand, then jump'd into his Seat,\r\nand wheel'd round Prince _Hottam_, while he lay sprawling on the\r\nGround. All the Spectators in general, with loud Acclamations, cried\r\nout, Victory! Victory! in favour of the Champion in white. _Hottam_,\r\nincens'd to the last Degree, got up, and drew his Sword. _Zadig_\r\nsprang from his Horse with his Sabre in his Hand. Now, behold the\r\ntwo Chieftains upon their Legs, commencing a new Trial of Skill!\r\nwhere they seem'd to get the better of each other alternately; for\r\nboth were strong, and both were active. The Feathers of their\r\nHelmets, the Studs of their Bracelets, their Coats of Mail, flew\r\nabout in Pieces, thro' the dry Blows which they a thousand Times\r\nrepeated. They struck at each other sometimes with the Edge of their\r\nSwords, at other Times they push'd, as Occasion offer'd: Now on the\r\nRight, then on the Left; now on the Head, then at the Breast; they\r\nretreated; they advanc'd; they kept at a Distance; they clos'd\r\nagain; they grasp'd each other, turning and twisting like two\r\nSerpents, and engag'd each other as fiercely as two _Libyan_ Lions\r\nfighting for their Prey: Their Swords struck Fire almost at every\r\nBlow. At last, _Zadig_, in order to recover his Breath, for a Moment\r\nor two stood still, and afterwards, making a Feint at the Prince,\r\nthrew him on his Back, and disarm'd him. _Hottam_, thereupon, cried\r\nout, O thou Knight of the white Armour! 'Tis you only are destin'd\r\nto be the King of _Babylon_. The Queen was perfectly transported.\r\nThe two Champions were reconducted to their separate Lodges, as the\r\nothers had been before them, in Conformity to the Laws prescrib'd.\r\nSeveral Mutes were order'd to wait on the Champions, and carry them\r\nsome proper Refreshment. We'll leave the Reader to judge whether the\r\nQueen's Dwarf was not appointed to wait on _Zadig_ on this happy\r\nOccasion. After Supper the Mutes withdrew, and left the Combatants\r\nto rest their wearied Limbs till the next Morning; at which Time the\r\nVictor was to produce his _Device_, before the _Grand Magus_, in\r\norder to confer Notes, and discover the Hero whoever he might be.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ slept very sound, notwithstanding his amorous Regard for the\r\nQueen, being perfectly fatigu'd. _Itabod_, who lay in the Lodge\r\ncontiguous to his, could not once close his Eyes for Vexation. He\r\ngot up therefore in the Dead of the Night, stole imperceptibly into\r\n_Zadig's_ Apartment, took his white Armour and Device away with him,\r\nand substituted his green One in its Place.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Day began to dawn, he repair'd, with a seemingly\r\nundaunted Courage, to the _Grand Magus_, to inform him, that he was\r\nthe mighty Hero, the happy Victor. Without the least Hesitation, he\r\ngain'd his Point, and was proclaim'd Victor before _Zadig_ was\r\nawake. _Astarte_, astonish'd at this unexpected Disappointment,\r\nreturn'd with a Heart overwhelm'd with Despair, to the Court of\r\n_Babylon_. Almost all the Spectators were mov'd off from the\r\nAmphitheatre before _Zadig_ wak'd: He hunted for his Arms; but could\r\nfind nothing but those in green. He was oblig'd, tho' sorely against\r\nhis Will, to put it on, having nothing else in his Lodge to appear\r\nin: Confounded, and big with Resentment, he drest himself, and made\r\nhis personal Appearance in that despicable Equipage. The Populace\r\nthat were left behind in the _Circus_, hiss'd him every Step he\r\ntook, they made a Ring about him, and treated him with all the Marks\r\nof Ignominy and Contempt. The most cowardly Wretch breathing was\r\nnever sure so sweated, or hunted down as poor _Zadig_! He grew quite\r\nout of Patience at last, and cut his Way thro' the insulting Mob,\r\nwith his Rival's Sabre; but he did not know what Measures to pursue,\r\nor how to rectify so gross a Mistake. It was not in his Power to\r\nhave a Sight of the Queen; he could never recover the white Armour\r\nagain which She had sent him; That was the Compromise, or the\r\nEngagement, to which the Combatants had all unanimously agreed:\r\nThus, as he was on the one Hand, plung'd in an Abyss of Sorrow; so\r\non the other, he was almost drove distracted with Vexation and\r\nResentment. He withdrew therefore, in a solitary Mood, to the Banks\r\nof the _Euphrates_, now fully persuaded, that his impropitious Star\r\nhad shed its most baleful Influence on him, and that his Misfortunes\r\nwere irretrievable, revolving in his Mind, all his Disappointments\r\nfrom his first Adventure with the Court-Coquet, who had entertain'd\r\nan utter Aversion to a blind Eye, down to his late Loss of his white\r\nArmour. See! said he, the fatal Consequence of being a Sluggard! Had\r\nI been more vigilant, I had been King of _Babylon_; but what is\r\nmore, I had been happy in the Embraces of my dearest _Astarte_. All\r\nthe Knowledge of Books or Mankind; all the personal Valour that I\r\ncan boast of, has only prov'd an Aggravation of my Sorrows. He\r\ncarried the Point so far at last, as to murmur at the unequal\r\nDispensations of Divine Providence; and was tempted to believe, that\r\nall Occurrences were govern'd by a malignant Destiny, which never\r\nfail'd to oppress the Virtuous, and always crown'd the Actions of\r\nsuch Villains as the green Knight, with uncommon Success. In one of\r\nhis frantick Fits, he put on the green Armour, that had created him\r\nsuch a World of Disgrace. A Merchant happening to pass by, he sold\r\nit to him for a Trifle, and took in Exchange nothing more than a\r\nMantle, and a Cap. In this Disguise, he took a solitary Walk along\r\nthe Banks of the _Euphrates_, every Minute reflecting in his Mind on\r\nthe partial Proceedings of Providence, which never ceas'd to torment\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\n_The_ HERMIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs _Zadig_ was travelling along, he met with a Hermit, whose grey\r\nand venerable Beard descended to his Girdle. He had in his Hand a\r\nlittle Book, on which his Eyes were fix'd. _Zadig_ threw himself in\r\nhis Way, and made him a profound Bow. The Hermit return'd the\r\nCompliment with such an Air of Majesty and Benevolence, that\r\n_Zadig's_ Curiosity prompted him to converse with so agreeable a\r\nStranger. Pray, Sir, said he, what may be the Contents of the\r\nTreatise you are reading with such Attention. 'Tis call'd, said the\r\nHermit, the _Book of Fate_; will you please to look at it. He put\r\nthe Book into the Hands of _Zadig_, who, tho' he was a perfect\r\nMaster of several Languages, couldn't decypher one single Character.\r\nThis rais'd his Curiosity still higher. You seem dejected, said the\r\ngood Father to him. Alas! I have Cause enough, said _Zadig_. If\r\nyou'll permit me to accompany you, said the old Hermit, perhaps I\r\nmay be of some Service to you. I have sometimes instill'd Sentiments\r\nof Consolation into the Minds of the Afflicted. _Zadig_ had a secret\r\nRegard for the Air of the old Man, for his Beard, and his Book. He\r\nfound, by conversing with him, that he was the most learned Person\r\nhe had ever met with. The Hermit harangu'd on Destiny, Justice,\r\nMorality, the sovereign Good, the Frailty of Nature; on Virtue and\r\nVice, in such a lively Manner, and in such a Flow of Words, that\r\n_Zadig_ was attach'd to him by an invincible Charm. He begg'd\r\nearnestly that he would favour him with his Company to _Babylon_.\r\nThat Favour I was going to ask my self, said the old Man. Swear to\r\nme by _Orosmades_, that you won't leave me, for some Days at least,\r\nlet me do what I please. _Zadig_ took the Oath requir'd, and both\r\npursu'd their Journey.\r\n\r\nThe two Travellers arriv'd that Evening at a superb Castle. The\r\nHermit begg'd for an hospitable Reception of himself and his young\r\nComrade. The Porter, whom any One might have taken for some Grandee,\r\nlet them in, but with a kind of Coldness and Contempt. However, he\r\nconducted them to the Head-Steward, who went with them thro' every\r\nrich Apartment of his Master's House. They were seated at Supper\r\nafterwards at the lower End, indeed, of the Table, and where they\r\nwere taken little or no Notice of by the Host; but they were serv'd\r\nwith as much Delicacy and Profusion, as any of the other Guests.\r\nWhen they arose from Table, they wash'd their Hands in a Golden\r\nBason set with Emeralds, and other costly Stones. When 'twas Time to\r\ngo to Rest, they were conducted into a Bed-chamber richly furnish'd;\r\nand the next Morning two Pieces of Gold were presented to him for\r\ntheir mutual Service, by a Valet in waiting; and then they were\r\ndismiss'd.\r\n\r\nThe Proprietor of this Castle, said _Zadig_, as they were upon the\r\nRoad, seems to me to be a very hospitable Gentleman; tho' somewhat\r\ntoo haughty indeed, and too imperious: The Words were no sooner out\r\nof his Mouth, but he perceiv'd that the Pocket of his Comrade's\r\nGarment, tho' very large, was swell'd, and greatly extended: He soon\r\nsaw what was the Cause, and that he had clandestinely brought off\r\nthe Golden Laver. He durst not immediately take Notice of the Fact;\r\nbut was ready to sink at the very Thoughts on't. About Noon, the\r\nHermit rapp'd at a petty Cottage with his Staff, the beggarly\r\nResidence of an old, rich Miser. He desir'd that he and his\r\nCompanion might refresh themselves there for a few Hours. An old,\r\nshabby Domestick let them in indeed, but with visible Reluctance,\r\nand carried them into the Stable, where all their Fare was a few\r\nmusty Olives, and a Draught or two of sower small Beer. The Hermit\r\nseem'd as content with his Repast, as he was the Night before. At\r\nlast, rising off from his Seat, he paid his Compliments to the old\r\nValet (who had as watchful an Eye over them all the Time, as if they\r\nhad been a Brace of Thieves, and intimated every now and then that\r\nhe fear'd they would be benighted) and gave him the two Pieces of\r\nGold, he had but just receiv'd that Morning, as a Token of his\r\nGratitude for his courteous Entertainment. He added moreover, I\r\nwould willingly speak one Word with your Master before I go. The\r\nValet, thunder-struck at his unexpected Gratuity, comply'd with his\r\nRequest: Most hospitable Sir, said the Hermit, I couldn't go away\r\nwithout returning you my grateful Acknowledgments for the friendly\r\nReception we have met with this Afternoon. Be pleas'd to accept this\r\nGolden Bason as a small Token of my Gratitude and Esteem. The Miser\r\nstarted, and was ready to fall down backwards at the Sight of so\r\nvaluable a Present. The Hermit gave him no Time to recover out of\r\nhis Surprise, but march'd off that Moment with his young Comrade.\r\nFather, said _Zadig_, What is all this that I have seen? You seem to\r\nme to act in a quite different Manner from the Generality of\r\nMankind. You plunder One, who entertain'd you with all the Pomp and\r\nProfusion in the World, to enrich a covetous, sordid Wretch, who\r\ntreated you in the most unworthy Manner. Son, said the old Man, that\r\nGrandee, who receives Visits of Strangers, with no other View than\r\nto gratify his Pride, and to raise their Astonishment at the\r\nFurniture of his Palace, will henceforward learn to be wiser; and\r\nthe Miser to be more liberal for the Time to come. Don't be\r\nsurpris'd, but follow me. _Zadig_ was at a stand at present; and\r\ncouldn't well determine whether his Companion was a Man of greater\r\nWisdom than ordinary, or a Mad-man. But the Hermit assum'd such an\r\nAscendency over him, exclusive of the Oath he had taken, that he\r\ncouldn't tell how to leave him. At Night they came to a House very\r\ncommodiously built, but neat and plain; where nothing was wanting,\r\nand yet nothing profuse. The Master was a Philosopher, that had\r\nretir'd from the busy World, in order to live in Peace, and form his\r\nMind to Virtue. He was pleas'd to build this little Box for the\r\nReception of Strangers, in a handsome Manner, but without\r\nOstentation. He came in Person to meet them at the Door, and for a\r\nTime, advis'd them to sit down and rest themselves in a commodious\r\nApartment. After some Respite, he invited them to a frugal, yet\r\nelegant Repast; during which, he talk'd very intelligently about the\r\nlate Revolutions in _Babylon_. He seem'd entirely to be in the\r\nQueen's Interest, and heartily wish'd that _Zadig_ had entred the\r\nLists for the regal Prize: But _Babylon_, said he, don't deserve a\r\nKing of so much Merit. A modest Blush appear'd in _Zadig's_ Face at\r\nthis unexpected Compliment, which innocently aggravated his\r\nMisfortunes. It was agreed, on all Hands, that the Affairs of this\r\nWorld took sometimes a quite different Turn from what the wisest\r\nPatriots would wish them. The Hermit replied, the Ways of Providence\r\nare often very intricate and obscure, and Men were much to blame for\r\ncasting Reflections on the Conduct of the Whole, upon the bare\r\nInspection of the minutest Part.\r\n\r\nThe next Topick they entred upon was the Passions. Alas! said\r\n_Zadig_, how fatal in their Consequences! However, said the Hermit,\r\nthey are the Winds that swell the Sail of the Vessel. Sometimes,\r\n'tis true, they overset it; but there is no such Thing as sailing\r\nwithout them. Phlegm, indeed, makes Men peevish and sick; but then\r\nthere is no living without it. Tho' every Thing here below is\r\ndangerous, yet All are necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the next Place, their Discourse turn'd on sensual Pleasures; and\r\nthe Hermit demonstrated, that they were the Gifts of Heaven; for,\r\nsaid he, Man cannot bestow either Sensations or Ideas on himself; he\r\nreceives them all; his Pain and Pleasure, as well as his Being,\r\nproceed from a superior Cause.\r\n\r\n_Zadig_ stood astonish'd, to think how a Man that had committed such\r\nvile Actions, could argue so well on such Moral Topicks. At the\r\nproper Hour, after an Entertainment, not only instructive, but ev'ry\r\nway agreeable, their Host conducted them to their Bed-chamber,\r\nthanking Heaven for directing two such polite and virtuous Strangers\r\nto his House. He offer'd them at the same Time some Silver, to\r\ndefray their Expences on the Road; but with such an Air of Respect\r\nand Benevolence, that 'twas impossible to give the least Disgust.\r\nThe Hermit, however, refus'd it, and took his leave, as he propos'd\r\nto set forward for _Babylon_ by Break of Day. Their Parting was very\r\naffectionate and friendly; _Zadig_, in particular, express'd a more\r\nthan common Regard for a Man of so amiable a Behaviour. When the\r\nHermit and he were alone, and preparing for Bed, they talk'd long in\r\nPraise of their new Host. As soon as Day-light appear'd, the old\r\nHermit wak'd his young Comrade. 'Tis Time to be gone, said he; but\r\nas all the House are fast asleep, I'll leave a Token behind me of my\r\nRespect and Affection for the Master of it. No sooner were the Words\r\nout of his Mouth, but he struck a Light, kindled a Torch, and set\r\nthe Building in a Flame: _Zadig_, in the utmost Confusion, shriek'd\r\nout, and would, if possible, have prevented him from being guilty of\r\nsuch a monstrous Act of Ingratitude. The Hermit dragg'd him away, by\r\na superior Force. The House was soon in a Blaze: When they had got\r\nat a convenient Distance, the Hermit, with an amazing Sedateness,\r\nturn'd back and survey'd the destructive Flames. Behold, said he,\r\nour fortunate Friend! In the Ruins, he will find an immense\r\nTreasure, that will enable him, from henceforth, to exert his\r\nBeneficence, and render his Virtues more and more conspicuous.\r\n_Zadig_, tho' astonish'd to the last Degree, attended him to their\r\nlast Stage, which was to the Cottage of a very virtuous and\r\nwell-dispos'd Widow, who had a Nephew of about fourteen Years of\r\nAge. He was a hopeful Youth, and the Darling of her Heart. She\r\nentertain'd her two Guests with the best Provisions her little House\r\nafforded. In the Morning she order'd her Nephew to attend them to an\r\nadjacent Bridge, which, having been broken down some few Days\r\nbefore, render'd the Passage dangerous to Strangers.\r\n\r\nThe Lad, being very attentive to wait on them, went formost. When\r\nthey were got upon the Bridge; come hither, my pretty Boy, said the\r\nHermit, I must give your Aunt some small Token of my Respect for her\r\nlast Night's Favours. Upon that, he twisted his Fingers in the Hair\r\nof his Head, and threw him, very calmly, into the River. Down went\r\nthe little Lad; he came up once again to the Surface of the Water;\r\nbut was soon lost in the rapid Stream. O thou Monster! thou worst of\r\nVillains, cry'd _Zadig_! Didn't you promise, said the Hermit, to\r\nview my Conduct with Patience? Know then, that had that Boy liv'd\r\nbut one Year longer, he would have murder'd his Foster-Mother. Who\r\ntold you so, you barbarous Wretch, said _Zadig_? And when did you\r\nread that inhuman Event in your _Black-Book_ of _Fate_? Who gave you\r\nPermission pray, to drown so innocent a Youth, that had never\r\ndisoblig'd you?\r\n\r\nNo sooner had our young _Babylonian_ ceas'd his severe Reflections,\r\nbut he perceiv'd that the old Hermit's long Beard grew shorter and\r\nshorter; that the Furrows in his Face began to fill up, and that his\r\nCheeks glow'd with a Rose-coloured Red, as if he had been in the\r\nBloom of Fifteen. His Mantle was vanish'd at once; and on his\r\nShoulders, which were before cover'd, appear'd four angelic Wings,\r\neach refulgent as the Sun. O thou Messenger of Heaven! O thou\r\nangelic Form! cry'd _Zadig_, and fell prostrate at his Feet; thou\r\nart descended from the Empireum, I find, to instruct such a poor\r\nfrail Mortal as I am, how to submit to the Mysteries of Fate.\r\nMankind in general, said the Angel _Jesrad_, judge of the Whole, by\r\nonly viewing the hither Link of the Chain. Thou, of all the human\r\nRace, wast the only Man that deserv'd to have thy Mind enlighten'd.\r\n_Zadig_, begg'd Leave to speak. I am somewhat diffident of myself,\r\n'tis true; but may I presume, Sir, to beg the Solution of one\r\nScruple? Would it not have been better to have chastiz'd the Lad,\r\nand by that Means reform'd him, than to have cut him off thus\r\nunprepar'd in a Moment. _Jesrad_, replied, had he been virtuous, and\r\nhad he liv'd, 'twas his _Fate_ not only to be murder'd himself, but\r\nhis Wife, whom he would afterwards have married, and the little\r\nInfant, that was to have been the Pledge of their mutual Affection.\r\nIs it necessary then, venerable Guide, that there should be\r\nWickedness and Misfortunes in the World, and that those Misfortunes\r\nshould fall with Weight on the Heads of the Righteous? The Wicked,\r\nreplied _Jesrad_, are always unhappy. Misfortunes are intended only\r\nas a Touch-stone, to try a small Number of the Just, who are thinly\r\nscatter'd about this terrestrial Globe: Besides, there is no Evil\r\nunder the Sun, but some Good proceeds from it: But, said _Zadig_,\r\nSuppose the World was all Goodness, and there was no such Thing in\r\nNature as Evil. Then, that World of yours, said _Jesrad_, would be\r\nanother World; the Chain of Events would be another Wisdom; and that\r\nother Order, which would be perfect, must of Necessity be the\r\neverlasting Residence of the supreme Being, whom no Evil can\r\napproach. That great and first Cause has created an infinite Number\r\nof Worlds, and no two of them alike. This vast Variety is an\r\nAttribute of his Omnipotence. There are not two Leaves on the Trees\r\nthroughout the Universe, nor any two Globes of Light amongst the\r\nMyriad of Stars that deck the infinite Expanse of Heaven, which are\r\nperfectly alike. And whatever you see on that small Atom of Earth,\r\nwhereof you are a Native, must exist in the Place, and at the Time\r\nappointed, according to the immutable Decrees of him who comprehends\r\nthe Whole. Mankind imagine, that the Lad, whom I plung'd into the\r\nRiver, was drown'd by _Chance_; and that our generous Benefactor's\r\nHouse was reduc'd to Ashes by the same _Chance_; but know, there is\r\nno such Thing as _Chance_, all Misfortunes are intended, either as\r\nsevere Trials, Judgments, or Rewards; and are the Result of\r\nForeknowledge. You remember, Sir, the poor Fisherman in Despair,\r\nthat thought himself the most unhappy Mortal breathing. The great\r\n_Orasmades_, sent you to amend his Situation. Frail Mortal! Cease to\r\ncontend with what you ought to adore. But, said _Zadig_--whilst the\r\nSound of the Word But dwelt upon his Tongue, the Angel took his\r\nFlight towards the tenth Sphere. _Zadig_ sunk down upon his Knees,\r\nand acknowledg'd an over-ruling Providence with all the Marks of the\r\nprofoundest Submission. The Angel, as he was soaring towards the\r\nClouds, cried out in distinct Accents; Make thy Way towards\r\n_Babylon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ AENIGMAS, or RIDDLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zadig_, as one beside himself, and perfectly thunder-struck, beat\r\nhis March at random. He entred, however, into the City of _Babylon_,\r\non that very Day, when those Combatants who had been before engag'd\r\nin the List or Circus, were already assembled in the spacious\r\nOuter-Court of the Palace, in order to solve the AEnigmas, and give\r\nthe wisest Answers they could to such Questions, as the _Grand\r\nMagus_ should propose. All the Parties concern'd were present,\r\nexcept the Knight of the Green Armour. No sooner had _Zadig_ made\r\nhis Appearance in the City, but the Populace flock'd round about\r\nhim: No Eye was satisfied with gazing at him: All in general were\r\nlavish of their Praises, and in their Hearts wish'd him their\r\nSovereign, except the envious Man, who as he pass'd by, fetch'd a\r\ndeep Sigh, and turn'd his Head aside. The Populace with loud\r\nAcclamations attended him to the Palace-Gate. The Queen, who had\r\nheard of his Arrival, was in the utmost Agony, between Hope and\r\nDespair. Her Vexation had almost brought her to Death's Door; she\r\ncouldn't conceive why _Zadig_ should appear without his\r\nAccoutrements, nor imagine which Way _Itobad_ could procure the\r\nsnow-white Armour. At the Sight of _Zadig_ a confus'd Murmur ran\r\nthro' the whole Place. Every Eye was surpriz'd, tho' charm'd at the\r\nsame Time to see him again: But then none were to be admitted into\r\nthe Assembly-Room except the Knights.\r\n\r\nI have fought as successfully as any one of them all, said _Zadig_,\r\ntho' another appears clad in my Armour; but in the mean Time, before\r\nI can possibly prove my Assertion, I insist upon being admitted into\r\nCourt, in order to give my Solutions to such AEnigmas as shall be\r\npropos'd. 'Twas put to the Vote. As the Reputation of his being a\r\nMan of the strictest Honour and Veracity was so strongly imprinted\r\non their Minds, the Motion of his Admittance was carried in the\r\nAffirmative, without the least Opposition.\r\n\r\nThe first Question the _Grand Magus_ propos'd was this: What is the\r\nlongest and yet the shortest Thing in the World; the most swift and\r\nthe most slow; the most divisible, and the most extended; the least\r\nvalu'd, and the most regretted; And without which nothing can\r\npossibly be done: Which, in a Word, devours every Thing how minute\r\nsoever, and yet gives Life and Spirit to every Object or Being,\r\nhowever Great?\r\n\r\n_Itobad_ had the Honour to answer first. His reply was, that a Man\r\nof his Merit had something else to think on, than idle Riddles;\r\n'twas enough for him, that he was acknowledg'd the Hero of the\r\nCircus. One said, the Solution of the AEnigma propos'd was _Fortune_;\r\nothers said the _Earth_; and others again the _Light_: But _Zadig_\r\npronounced it to be _Time_. Nothing, said he, can be longer, since\r\n'tis the Measure of Eternity; Nothing is shorter, since there is\r\nTime always wanting to accomplish what we aim at. Nothing passes so\r\nslowly as Time to him who is in Expectation; and nothing so swift as\r\nTime to him who is in the perfect Enjoyment of his Wishes. It's\r\nExtent is to Infinity, in the Whole; and divisible to Infinity in\r\npart. All Men neglect it in the Passage; and all regret the Loss of\r\nit when 'tis past. Nothing can possibly be done without it; it\r\nburies in Oblivion whatever is unworthy of being transmitted down to\r\nPosterity; and it renders all illustrious Actions immortal. The\r\nAssembly agreed unanimously that _Zadig_ was in the Right.\r\n\r\nThe next Question that was started, was, What is the Thing we\r\nreceive, without being ever thankful for it; which we enjoy, without\r\nknowing how we came by it; which we give away to others, without\r\nknowing where 'tis to be found; and which we lose, without being any\r\nways conscious of our Misfortune?\r\n\r\nEach pass'd his Verdict. _Zadig_ was the only Person that concluded\r\nit was LIFE. He solv'd every AEnigma propos'd, with equal Facility.\r\n_Itobad_, when he heard the Explications, always said that nothing\r\nin the World was more easy, than to solve such obvious Questions;\r\nand that he could interpret a thousand of them without the least\r\nHesitation, were he inclin'd to trouble his Head about such Trifles.\r\nOther Questions were propos'd in regard to Justice, the sovereign\r\nGood, and the Art of Government. _Zadig's_ Answers still carried the\r\ngreatest Weight. What Pity 'tis, said some who were present, that\r\none of so comprehensive a Genius, should make such a scurvy\r\nCavalier?\r\n\r\nMost illustrious Grandees, said _Zadig_, I was the Person that had\r\nthe Honour of being Victor at your Circus; the white Armour, most\r\npuissant Lords, was mine. That awkward Warrior there, Lord _Itobad_,\r\ndress'd himself in it whilst I was asleep. He imagin'd, it is plain,\r\nthat it would do him more Honour than his own Green one. Unaccoutred\r\nas I am, I am ready, before this august Assembly, to give them\r\nincontestable Proof of my superior Skill; to engage with the Usurper\r\nof the White Armour with my Sword only in my Mantle and Bonnet; and\r\nto testify that I only was the happy Victor of the justly admired\r\n_Hottam_.\r\n\r\n_Itobad_ accepted of the Challenge with all the Assurance of Success\r\nimaginable. He did not doubt, but being properly accoutred with his\r\nHelmet, his Cuirass, and his Bracelets, he should be able to hue\r\ndown an Antagonist, in his Mantle and Cap, and nothing to skreen him\r\nfrom his Resentment, but a single Sabre. _Zadig_ drew his Sword, and\r\nsaluted the Queen with it, who view'd him with Transport mix'd with\r\nFear. _Itobad_ drew his, but paid his Compliments to Nobody. He\r\napproach'd _Zadig_, as one, whom he imagin'd incapable of making any\r\nconsiderable Resistance. He concluded, 'twas in his Power to cut\r\n_Zadig_ into Atoms. _Zadig_, however, knew how to parry the Blow, by\r\ndexterously receiving it upon his _Fort_ (as the Swords-men call it)\r\nby which Means _Itobad's_ Sword was snapt in two. With that _Zadig_\r\nin an Instant clos'd his Adversary, and by his superior Strength, as\r\nwell as Skill, laid him sprawling on his Back. Then holding the\r\nPoint of his Sword to the opening of his Cuirass, Submit to be\r\nstripp'd of your borrow'd Plumes, or you are a dead Man this Moment.\r\n_Itobad_, always surpriz'd, that any Disappointment should attend a\r\nMan of such exalted Merit as himself, very tamely permitted _Zadig_\r\nto disrobe him by Degrees of his pompous Helmet, his superb Cuirass,\r\nhis rich Bracelets, his brilliant Cuisses, or Armour for his Thighs,\r\nand other Martial Accoutrements. When _Zadig_ had equipp'd himself\r\n_Cap-a-pee_, in his now recover'd Armour, he flew to _Astarte_, and\r\nthrew himself prostrate at her Feet. _Cador_ prov'd, without any\r\ngreat Difficulty, that the White Armour was _Zadig's_ Property. He\r\nwas thereupon acknowledg'd King of _Babylon_, by the unanimous\r\nContent of the Whole Court; but more particularly with the\r\nApprobation of _Astarte_, who after such a long Series of\r\nMisfortunes, now tasted the Sweets of seeing her darling _Zadig_\r\nthought worthy, in the Opinion of the whole World, to be the Partner\r\nof her royal Bed. _Itobad_ withdrew, and contented himself with\r\nbeing call'd _my Lord_ within the narrow Compass of his own\r\nDomesticks. _Zadig_, in short, was elected King, and was as happy as\r\nany Mortal could be.\r\n\r\nNow he began to reflect on what the Angel _Jesrad_ had said to him:\r\nNay, he reflected so far back as the Story of the _Arabian_ Atom of\r\nDust metamorphosed into a Diamond. The Queen and He ador'd the\r\nDivine Providence. _Zadig_ permitted _Missouf_, the Fair Coquet, to\r\nmake her Conquests where she could. He sent Couriers to bring the\r\nFree-booter _Arbogad_ to Court, and gave him an Honourable Military\r\nPost in his Army, with a farther Promise of Promotion to the highest\r\nDignity; but upon this express Condition, that he would act for the\r\nfuture as a Soldier of Honour; but assur'd him at the same Time,\r\nthat he'd make a publick Example of him, if he follow'd his\r\nProfession of Free-booting for the future.\r\n\r\n_Setoc_ was sent for from the lonely Desarts of _Arabia_, together\r\nwith the fair _Almonza_, his new Bride, to preside over the\r\ncommercial Affairs of _Babylon_. _Cador_ was advanc'd to a Post near\r\nhimself, and was his Favourite Minister at Court, as the just Reward\r\nof his past Services. He was, in short, the King's real Friend; and\r\n_Zadig_ was the only Monarch in the Universe that could boast of\r\nsuch an Attendant. The Dwarf, tho' dumb, was not wholly forgotten.\r\nThe Fisherman was put into the Possession of a very handsome House;\r\nand _Orcan_ was sentenc'd, not only to pay him a very considerable\r\nSum for the Injustice done him in detaining his Wife; but to resign\r\nher likewise to the proper Owner: The Fisherman, however, grown wise\r\nby Experience, soften'd the Rigour of the Sentence, and took the\r\nMoney only in full of all Accounts.\r\n\r\nHe didn't leave so much as _Semira_ wholly disconsolate, tho' she\r\nhad such an Aversion to a blind Eye; nor _Azora_ comfortless,\r\nnotwithstanding her affectionate Intention to shorten his Nose; for\r\nhe sooth'd their Sorrows by very munificent Presents. The envious\r\nInformer indeed, died with Shame and Vexation. The Empire was\r\nglorious abroad, and in the full Enjoyment of Tranquility, Peace and\r\nPlenty, at home: This, in short, was the true golden Age. The whole\r\nCountry was sway'd by Love and Justice. Every one blest _Zadig_; and\r\n_Zadig_ blest Heav'n for his unexpected Success.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FINIS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n    Spelling and punctuation are as found (for example,\r\n    _Itabod/Itobad_ was left as printed), with one exception:\r\n    the original reads \"purcha'd\" in \"An _Arabian_ Merchant,\r\n    _Setoc_ by Name, purchas'd them both;\"\r\n\r\n    Hyphenated words are closed up if all other examples are\r\n    closed, otherwise not. If there is a mix of broken and not,\r\n    then it was left with a hyphen.\r\n\r\n    Italic possessives were changed for clarity (for example,\r\n    _Zadig's_ not _Zadig_'s).",
