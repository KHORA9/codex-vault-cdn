His name was K'ung Ch'iu, and his style (corresponding to\r\nour Christian name) was Chung-ni. His countrymen speak of him as K'ung\r\nFu-tzu, the Master, or philosopher K'ung. This expression was altered\r\ninto Confucius by the Jesuit missionaries who first carried his fame\r\nto Europe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: According to the great historian Ssu-ma Ch'ien. Other\r\nauthorities say, 552 and 551 B.C.]\r\n\r\nSince the golden days of the Emperors Yao and Shun, the legendary\r\nfounders of the Chinese Empire, nearly two thousand years had passed.\r\nShun chose as his successor Yü, who had been his chief minister, a man\r\nwhose devotion to duty was such that when engaged in draining the\r\nempire of the great flood--a task that took eight years to\r\naccomplish--he never entered his home till the work was done, although\r\nin the course of his labours he had thrice to pass his door. He\r\nfounded the Hsia dynasty, which lasted till 1766 B.C. The last emperor\r\nof this line, a vile tyrant, was overthrown by T'ang, who became the\r\nfirst ruler of the house of Shang, or Yin. This dynasty again\r\ndegenerated in course of time and came to an end in Chou, or Chou Hsin\r\n(1154-22 B.C.), a monster of lust, extravagance, and cruelty. The\r\nempire was only held together by the strength and wisdom of the Duke\r\nof Chou, or King Wen, to give him his popular title, one of the\r\ngreatest men in Chinese history. He controlled two-thirds of the\r\nempire; but, believing that the people were not yet ready for a\r\nchange, he refrained from dethroning the emperor. In his day 'the\r\nhusbandman paid one in nine; the pay of the officers was hereditary;\r\nmen were questioned at barriers and at markets, but there were no\r\ntolls; fishgarths were not preserved; the children of criminals were\r\nsackless. The old and wifeless--the widower; the old and\r\nhusbandless--the widow; the old and childless--the lone one; the young\r\nand fatherless--the orphan; these four are the people most in need\r\nbelow heaven, and they have no one to whom to cry, so when King Wen\r\nreigned his love went out first to them' (Mencius, Book II, chapter\r\n5). After his death, his son, King Wu, decided that the nation was\r\nripe for change. He overcame Chou Hsin by force of arms, and, placing\r\nhimself on the throne, became the founder of the Chou dynasty.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Confucius the Chou dynasty still filled the throne. But\r\nit had long since become effete, and all power had passed into the\r\nhands of the great vassals. The condition of China was much like that\r\nof Germany in the worst days of the Holy Roman Empire. The emperor was\r\npowerless, the various vassal states were independent in all but name,\r\nand often at war one with the other. These states again were\r\ndisintegrated, and their rulers impotent against encroaching\r\nfeudatories. In Confucius' native state, Lu, the duke was a mere\r\nshadow. The younger branches of his house had usurped all power. Three\r\nin number, they were called the Three Clans. The most important of the\r\nthree was the Chi, or Chi-sun clan, whose chiefs Chi Huan and Chi\r\nK'ang are often mentioned by Confucius. But the power of the Chi, too,\r\nwas ill-secured. The minister Yang Huo overawed his master, and once\r\neven threw him into prison. Nor was the condition of the other states\r\nof the empire better than that of Lu. Confucius thought it worse.\r\n\r\nInto this turbulent world Confucius was born. Though his father was\r\nonly a poor military officer, he could trace his descent from the\r\nimperial house of Yin. Confucius married at nineteen, and is known to\r\nhave had one son and one daughter. Shortly after his marriage he\r\nentered the service of the state as keeper of the granary. A year\r\nlater he was put in charge of the public fields. In 527 B.C. his\r\nmother died, and, in obedience to Chinese custom, he had to retire\r\nfrom public life. When the years of mourning were over, he did not\r\nagain take office, but devoted himself instead to study and teaching.\r\nAs the years rolled by his fame grew, and a band of pupils gathered\r\nround him. In 517 B.C. the anarchy in Lu reached such a pitch that\r\nConfucius moved to the neighbouring land of Ch'i. Here he had several\r\ninterviews with the reigning duke, but met with little encouragement\r\n(xviii. 3). So he soon returned to his native country, and resumed for\r\nfifteen years his work as student and teacher.\r\n\r\nDuring these fifteen years the power of the duke sank lower and lower,\r\nand the Chi was menaced by his minister Yang Huo. In times so dark,\r\nmen that loved quiet sought in the world of thought an escape from the\r\ngloom around them, whilst others that were less resigned turned over\r\nin their minds the causes of the realm's decay. Lao-tzu, the founder\r\nof the mystic Taoist philosophy, taught that in inaction alone peace\r\ncan be found; Mo-tzu proclaimed the doctrine of universal love: that\r\nwe should love all men as we love self, love the parents of others as\r\nwe love our own parents. Upright men were driven or fled from the\r\nworld. Confucius often met them in his wanderings, and was reproved\r\nfor not doing as they did. But his practical mind told him that\r\ninaction could not help the world, and that to find a remedy for the\r\nnation's ills, their cause must first be learned. This could only be\r\ndone by historical study. He therefore devoted himself to the study of\r\npast times, edited in later life the _Book of History_, and compiled\r\nthe work called _Spring and Autumn_, a history of his native state\r\nfrom 722 to 481 B.C. To bring again the golden days of Yao and Shun a\r\nreturn must be made to the principles of Wen and Wu, the kings that\r\nhad rebuilt the empire after tyranny and selfishness had laid it low.\r\nOf impracticable ideals and renunciation of the world no good could\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAt last in 501 B.C. Yang Huo was forced to flee from Lu, and prospects\r\nbrightened. A year later Confucius was appointed governor of a town.\r\nSo great was his success as governor that before long he was promoted\r\nto be Superintendent of Works, and then to be Chief Criminal Judge. He\r\nwon great influence with his master, and did much to lighten the\r\ngeneral misery. He so strengthened the power of the duke that\r\nneighbouring states grew jealous. To sow dissension between duke and\r\nminister the men of Ch'i sent the duke a gift of singing girls. Such\r\njoy they gave him that for three days no court was held. On this\r\nConfucius left the land, 497 B.C.\r\n\r\nFor the next thirteen years Confucius wandered from land to land,\r\nfollowed by his disciples, seeking in vain for a ruler that was\r\nwilling to employ him, and whom he was willing to serve. At times he\r\nwas exposed to danger, at other times to want. But as a rule he was\r\ntreated with consideration, although his teachings were ignored. Yet\r\nthirteen years of homeless wandering, of hopes deferred and\r\nfrustrated, must have been hard to bear. When he left office Confucius\r\nwas already fifty-three years old, and his life so far seemed a\r\nfailure. The sense of his wasted powers may well have tempted him now\r\nand again to take office under an unworthy ruler; but knowing that no\r\ngood could come of it he refrained, and probably he never seriously\r\nthought of doing so.\r\n\r\nIn 483 B.C., when Confucius was sixty-six years old, through the\r\ninfluence of his disciple Jan Yu, who was in the service of the Chi,\r\nthe Master was invited to return to his native land. Here he remained\r\ntill his death in 479 B.C. He had many interviews with the reigning\r\nduke and the head of the Chi clan, but gained no influence over either\r\nof them. So he turned once more to his favourite studies; edited the\r\n_Book of Poetry_--perhaps the most interesting collection of ancient\r\nsongs extant--and wrote _Spring and Autumn_. His closing years were\r\ndarkened by the loss of those dearest to him. First his son died, then\r\nYen Yüan, the disciple whom he loved best. At his death the Master was\r\novercome by grief, and he left none behind him that loved learning.\r\nLastly Tzu-lu, the frank and bold, was killed in battle. A little\r\nlater, in his seventy-first year, Confucius himself passed away, 479\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nThis book of the Master's Sayings is believed by the Chinese to have\r\nbeen written by the disciples of Confucius. But there is nothing to\r\nprove this, and some passages in the book point the other way. Book\r\nviii speaks of the death of Tseng-tzu, who did not die till 437 B.C.,\r\nforty-two years after the Master. The chief authority for the text as\r\nit stands to-day is a manuscript found in the house of Confucius in\r\n150 B.C., hidden there, in all likelihood, between the years 213 and\r\n211 B.C., when the reigning emperor was seeking to destroy every copy\r\nof the classics. We find no earlier reference to the book under its\r\npresent name. But Mencius (372-289 B.C.) quotes seven passages from\r\nit, in language all but identical with the present text, as the words\r\nof Confucius. No man ever talked the language of these sayings. Such\r\npith and smoothness is only reached by a long process of rounding and\r\npolishing. We shall probably come no nearer to the truth than Legge's\r\nconclusion that the book was put together by the pupils of the\r\ndisciples of Confucius, from the words and notebooks of their masters,\r\nabout the year 400 B.C.\r\n\r\nLEONARD A.

Further details\r\nabout the men and places mentioned in the text will be found in the\r\nIndex.\r\n\r\nDates I have taken from Legge, Hirth and other standard authors.\r\n\r\nIn Chinese names, consonants are generally pronounced as in English,\r\nvowels as in Italian.\r\n\r\n_E_, when not joined with _i_, is pronounced nearly as German _ö_, or\r\nmuch as _u_ in English l_u_ck.\r\n\r\n_ao_ rhymes approximately with h_ow_\r\n_ei_   \"          \"        \"   th_ey_\r\n_ou_   \"          \"        \"   th_ough_\r\n_uo_   \"          \"        \"   p_oo_r,\r\n\r\nthe _u_ being equivalent to _w_.\r\n\r\n_Chih_ and _Shih_ rhyme approximately with _her_. _Tzu_ is pronounced\r\nmuch as _sir_ in the vulgar _yessir_, but with a hissing sound\r\nprefixed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Master said, To learn and then do, is not that a pleasure? When\r\nfriends come from afar do we not rejoice? To live unknown and not\r\nfret, is not that to be a gentleman?\r\n\r\n2. Yu-tzu[2] said. Few men that are good sons and good brothers are\r\nfond of withstanding those over them. A man that is not fond of\r\nwithstanding those over him and is yet fond of broils is nowhere\r\nfound. A gentleman heeds the roots. When the root has taken, the Way\r\nis born. And to be a good son and a good brother, is not that the root\r\nof love?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, Smooth words and fawning looks are seldom found\r\nwith love.\r\n\r\n4. Tseng-tzu[3] said, Thrice daily I ask myself: In dealing for\r\nothers, have I been unfaithful? Have I been untrue to friends? Do I\r\npractise what I preach?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n5. The Master said, To guide a land of a thousand chariots, honour\r\nbusiness and be true; spend little and love men; time thy calls on the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n6. The Master said, The young should be dutiful at home, modest\r\nabroad, careful and true, overflowing in kindness for all, but in\r\nbrotherhood with love. And if they have strength to spare they should\r\nspend it on the arts.\r\n\r\n7. Tzu-hsia[3] said, If a man eschews beauty and honours worth, if he\r\nserves his father and mother with all his strength, if he is ready to\r\ngive his life for his lord, and keeps faith with his friends, though\r\nothers may say he has no learning, I must call him learned.\r\n\r\n8. The Master said, A gentleman will not be looked up to unless he is\r\nstaid, nor will his learning be sound. Put faithfulness and truth\r\nfirst; have no friends unlike thyself; be not ashamed to mend thy\r\nfaults.\r\n\r\n9. Tseng-tzu[4] said, Heed the dead, follow up the past, and the soul\r\nof the people will again grow great.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n10. Tzu-ch'in[5] said to Tzu-kung,[6] When he comes to a country the\r\nMaster always hears how it is governed; does he ask, or is it told\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: A disciple.]\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, The Master gets it by his warmth and honesty, by\r\npoliteness, modesty and yielding. The way the Master asks is unlike\r\nother men's asking.\r\n\r\n11. The Master said, Whilst thy father lives look for his purpose;\r\nwhen he is gone, look how he walked. To change nothing in thy father's\r\nways for three years may be called pious.\r\n\r\n12, Yu-tzu[7] said, To behave with ease is the best part of courtesy.\r\nThis was the beauty of the old kings' ways; this they followed in\r\nsmall and great. But knowing this, it will not do to give way to ease,\r\nunchecked by courtesy. This too is wrong.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n13. Yu-tzu said, If pledges are close to right, word can be kept. If\r\nattentions are close to courtesy, shame will be kept far. If we do not\r\nchoose our leaders wrong, we may worship them too.\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, A gentleman that does not seek to eat his fill,\r\nnor look for ease in his home, who is earnest at work and careful of\r\nspeech, who walks with those that keep the Way, and is guided by them,\r\nmay be said to love learning.\r\n\r\n15. Tzu-kung[8] said, Poor, but no flatterer; rich, but not proud: how\r\nwould that be?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: A disciple.]\r\n\r\nIt would do, said the Master; but better still were poor but merry;\r\nrich, but loving courtesy.\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, When the poem says:\r\n\r\n    If ye cut, if ye file,\r\n      If ye polish and grind,\r\n\r\nis that what is meant?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Now I can begin to talk of poetry to Tz'u. Tell him\r\nwhat is gone, and he knows what shall come.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, Not to be known is no sorrow. My sorrow is not\r\nknowing men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Master said, He that rules by mind is like the north star,\r\nsteady in his seat, whilst the stars all bend to him.\r\n\r\n2. The Master said, The three hundred poems are summed up in the one\r\nline, Think no evil.\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, Guide the people by law, aline them by punishment;\r\nthey may shun crime, but they will want shame. Guide them by mind,\r\naline them by courtesy; they will learn shame and grow good.\r\n\r\n4. The Master said, At fifteen, I had the will to learn; at thirty, I\r\ncould stand; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I understood the\r\nheavenly Bidding; at sixty, my ears were opened[9]; at seventy, I\r\ncould do as my heart lusted without trespassing from the square.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Lit._, obedient.]\r\n\r\n5. Meng Yi asked the duty of a son.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Not to transgress.\r\n\r\nAs Fan Chi'ih[10] was driving him, the Master said, Meng-sun[11] asked\r\nme the duty of a son; I answered, Not to transgress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Meng Yi.]\r\n\r\nWhat did ye mean? said Fan Chi'ih.\r\n\r\nTo serve our father and mother with courtesy whilst they live; to bury\r\nthem with courtesy when they die, and to worship them with courtesy.\r\n\r\n6. Meng Wu asked the duty of a son.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, He should not grieve his father and mother by\r\nanything but illness.\r\n\r\n7. Tzu-yu[12] asked the duty of a son.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: A disciple.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, He that can feed his parents is now called a good\r\nson. But both dogs and horses are fed, and unless we honour our\r\nparents, what is the difference?\r\n\r\n8. Tzu-hsia[13] asked the duty of a son.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: A disciple.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Our manner is the hard part. For the young to be a\r\nstay in toil and leave the wine and food to their elders, is this to\r\nfulfil their duty?\r\n\r\n9. The Master said, If I talk all day to Hui,[14] like a dullard, he\r\nnever differs from me. But when he is gone, if I watch him when alone,\r\nhe can carry out what I taught. No, Hui is no dullard!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The disciple Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n10. The Master said, See what he does; watch what moves him; search\r\nwhat pleases him: can the man lie hidden? Can the man lie hidden?\r\n\r\n11. The Master said, To keep old knowledge warm and get new makes the\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n12. The Master said, A gentleman is not a vessel.\r\n\r\n13. Tzu-kung[15] asked, What is a gentleman?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: A disciple.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, He puts words into deeds first, and follows these up\r\nwith words.\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, A gentleman is broad and fair; the small man\r\ntakes sides and is narrow.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, Learning without thought is naught; thought\r\nwithout learning is dangerous.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, To fight strange doctrines does harm.\r\n\r\n17. The Master said, Yu,[16] shall I teach thee what is wisdom? To\r\nknow what we know, and know what we do not know, is wisdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The disciple Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n18. Tsu-chang[17] learned with an eye to pay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: A disciple.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Hear much, leave all that is doubtful alone, speak\r\nwarily of everything else, and few will be offended. See much, leave\r\nall that is dangerous alone, deal warily with everything else, and\r\nthou wilt have little to rue. If thy words seldom give offence, and\r\nthy deeds leave little to rue, pay will follow.\r\n\r\n19. Duke Ai[18] asked, What should I do to win the people?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Of Lu.]\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, Lift up the straight, put away the crooked; and\r\nthe people will be won. Lift up the crooked, put away the straight;\r\nand the people will not be won.\r\n\r\n20. Chi K'ang[19] asked how to make the people lowly, faithful and\r\npainstaking.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The head of the Chi clan.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Meet them with dignity, they will be lowly; be a good\r\nson and merciful, they will be faithful; lift up the good and teach\r\nthe unskilled, and they will take pains.\r\n\r\n21. One said to Confucius, Why do ye not govern, Sir?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, What does the Book[20] say of a good son? 'To be a\r\ngood son and a friend to thy brothers is to show how to govern.'\r\nThis, too, is to govern. Must one be in office to govern?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The Book of History.]\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, A man without truth, I know not what good he is!\r\nA cart without a crosspole, a carriage without a yoke, how can they be\r\nmoved?\r\n\r\n23. Tzu-chang[21] asked whether we can know what is to be ten\r\ngenerations hence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: A disciple.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, The Yin[22] took over the manners of the Hsia; the\r\nharm and the good that they did them can be known. The Chou took over\r\nthe manners of the Yin; the harm and the good that they did them can\r\nbe known. And we may know what shall be, even an hundred generations\r\nhence, whoever follows Chou.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Up to the time of Confucius, China had been ruled by\r\nthree lines of kings. First the T'ang, next the Yin or Shang, then the\r\nChou.]\r\n\r\n24. The Master said, To worship the ghosts of men not akin to us is\r\nfawning. To see the right and not do it is want of courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Of the Chi having eight rows of dancers[23] in his courtyard,\r\nConfucius said, If this is to be borne, what is not to be borne?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: An Imperial prerogative.]\r\n\r\n2. When the sacrifice was ended, the Three Clans had the Yung hymn\r\nsung.\r\n\r\nThe Master said,\r\n\r\n    Princes and dukes assist.\r\n    Solemn is the Son of heaven;\r\n\r\nwhat meaning has this in the courtyard of the Three Clans?\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, A man without love, what is courtesy to him? A man\r\nwithout love, what is music to him?\r\n\r\n4. Lin Fang asked what good form is at root.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, A big question! At high-tides, thrift is better than\r\nwaste; at burials, grief is worth more than nicety.\r\n\r\n5. The Master said, Every wild tribe has its lord, whereas the lands\r\nof Hsia[24] have none!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: China.]\r\n\r\n6. The Chi sacrificed to Mount T'ai.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: A prerogative of the Duke of Lu.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said to Jan Yu,[26] Canst thou not stop this?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: A disciple in the service of the Chi.]\r\n\r\nHe answered, I cannot.\r\n\r\nAlas! said the Master; dost thou think Mount T'ai less wise than Lin\r\nFang?\r\n\r\n7. The Master said, A gentleman never strives with others. Or must he,\r\nperhaps, in shooting? But then, as he bows and makes way in going up\r\nor steps down to drink,[27] his strife is that of a gentleman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The loser had to drink a cup of wine.]\r\n\r\n8. Tzu-hsia asked, What is the meaning of:\r\n\r\n    Her cunning smiles,\r\n    Her dimples light,\r\n    Her lovely eyes,\r\n    So clear and bright,\r\n    All unadorned,\r\n    The background white.\r\n\r\nColouring, said the Master, is second to the plain ground.\r\n\r\nThen good form is second, said Tzu-hsia.\r\n\r\nShang,[28] said the Master, thou hast hit my meaning! Now I can talk\r\nof poetry to thee.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Tzu-hsia.]\r\n\r\n9. The Master said, I can speak of the manners of Hsia; but as proof\r\nof them Chi[29] is not enough. I can speak of the manners of Yin; but\r\nas proof of them Sung is not enough. This is due to their dearth of\r\nbooks and great men. If there were enough of these, I could use them\r\nas proofs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Chi was the homeland of the House of Hsia, Sung that of\r\nthe House of Yin.]\r\n\r\n10. The Master said, After the drink offering at the Great Sacrifice,\r\nI have no wish to see more.\r\n\r\n11. One asked the meaning of the Great Sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, I do not know. He that knew the meaning would\r\noverlook all below heaven as I do this--and he pointed to his palm.\r\n\r\n12. He worshipped as if those whom he worshipped were before him; he\r\nworshipped the spirits as if they were before him.\r\n\r\nThe Master said: For me, to take no part in the sacrifice is the same\r\nas not sacrificing.\r\n\r\n13. Wang-sun Chia[30] said, What is the meaning of, It is better to\r\ncourt the hearth-god than the god of the home?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Wang-sun Chia was minister of Wei, and had more\r\ninfluence than his master. The hearth-god ranks below the god of the\r\nhome (the Roman _lares_), but since he sees all that goes on in the\r\nhouse, and ascends to heaven at the end of the year to report what has\r\nhappened, it is well to be on good terms with him.]\r\n\r\nNot so, said the Master. A sin against Heaven leaves no room for\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, Chou[31] looks back on two lines of kings. How\r\nrich, how rich it is in art! I follow Chou.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: The royal house of Chou, which was then ruling China.]\r\n\r\n15. On going into the Great Temple the Master asked about everything.\r\n\r\nOne said, Who says that the Tsou man's son knows the rites? On going\r\ninto the Great Temple he asked about everything.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this, the Master said, Such is the rite.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, In shooting, the arrow need not go right through\r\nthe target, for men are not the same in strength. This was the old\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n17. Tzu-kung wished to do away with the sheep offering at the new\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Thou lovest the sheep, Tz'u: I love the rite.\r\n\r\n18. The Master said: Serve the king with all courtesy, men call it\r\nfawning.\r\n\r\n19. Duke Ting asked how a lord should treat his lieges, and how lieges\r\nshould serve their lord.\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, The lord should treat his lieges with courtesy;\r\nlieges should serve their lord faithfully.\r\n\r\n20. The Master said, The poem _The Osprey_ is glad, but not wanton; it\r\nis sad, but not morbid.\r\n\r\n21. Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the earth-altars.\r\n\r\nTsai Wo answered, The Emperors of the house of Hsia grew firs round\r\nthem; the men of Yin grew cypress; the men of Chou grew chestnut,\r\nwhich was to say, Let the people tremble.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Tremble_ and _chestnut_ have the same sound in\r\nChinese.]\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, the Master said, I do not speak of what is ended,\r\nchide what is settled, or find fault with what is past.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: In old times men had been sacrificed at the\r\nearth-altars, and Tsai Wo's answer might seem to approve the\r\npractice.]\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, How shallow was Kuan Chung!\r\n\r\nBut, said one, was not Kuan Chung thrifty?\r\n\r\nThe Kuan, said the Master, owned San Kuei, and no one of his household\r\nheld two posts: was that thrift?\r\n\r\nAt least Kuan Chung knew good form.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Kings screen their gates with trees; the Kuan, too,\r\nhad trees to screen his gate. When two kings are carousing, they have\r\na stand for the turned-down cups; the Kuan had a turned-down\r\ncup-stand, too! If the Kuan knew good form, who does not know good\r\nform?[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Kuan Chung (+ 645 B.C.), a famous man in his day, was\r\nchief minister to the Duke of Ch'i, whom he raised to such wealth and\r\npower that he became the leading prince of the empire. His chief merit\r\nlay in taming the barbarous frontier tribes. The rest of his work was\r\nbuilt upon sand and died with him.]\r\n\r\n23. The Master said to the Great Master[35] of Lu, We can learn how to\r\nplay music; at first each part in unison; then a swell of harmony,\r\neach part distinct, rolling on to the finish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Of music.]\r\n\r\n24. The warden of Yi asked to see Confucius, saying, No gentleman has\r\never come here whom I have failed to see.\r\n\r\nThe followers took him in.\r\n\r\nOn leaving he said, My two-three boys, why lament your fall? The Way\r\nhas long been lost below heaven! Now Heaven shall make the Master into\r\na warning bell.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said of the music of Shao, It is thoroughly beautiful,\r\nand thoroughly good, too. Of the music of Wu, he said, It is\r\nthoroughly beautiful, but not thoroughly good.\r\n\r\n26. The Master said, Rank without beauty; ceremony without reverence;\r\nmourning without grief, why should I cast them a glance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Master said, Love makes a spot beautiful: who chooses not to\r\ndwell in love, has he got wisdom?\r\n\r\n2. The Master said, Loveless men cannot bear need long, they cannot\r\nbear fortune long. Loving men find peace in love, the wise find profit\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, Love alone can love others, or hate others.\r\n\r\n4. The Master said, A will set on love is free from evil.\r\n\r\n5. The Master said, Wealth and honours are what men desire; but do not\r\ngo from the Way, to keep them. Lowliness and want are hated by men;\r\nbut do not go from the Way, to escape them.\r\n\r\nShorn of love, is a gentleman worthy of the name? Not for one moment\r\nmay a gentleman sin against love; he must not do so in flurry and\r\nhaste, nor do so in utter overthrow.\r\n\r\n6. The Master said, I have seen no one that loves love and hates\r\nuncharity. He that loves love will set nothing higher. The hater of\r\nuncharity is so given to love that no uncharity can enter into his\r\nlife. If a man were to give his strength to love for one day, I have\r\nseen no one whose strength would fail him. There may be such men, but\r\nI have not seen one.\r\n\r\n7. The Master said, A man and his faults are of a piece. By watching\r\nhis faults we learn whether love be his.\r\n\r\n8. The Master said, To learn the Way at daybreak and die at eve were\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n9. The Master said, A knight[36] in quest of the Way, who is ashamed\r\nof bad clothes and bad food, it is idle talking to.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _Shih:_ a gentleman entitled to bear arms, not a knight\r\nin armour.]\r\n\r\n10. The Master said, A gentleman has no likes or dislikes below\r\nheaven. He follows right.\r\n\r\n11. The Master said, The gentleman cherishes mind, the small man\r\ncherishes dirt. Gentlemen trust in the law, the small man trusts in\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n12. The Master said, The chase of gain is rich in hate.\r\n\r\n13. The Master said, What is it to sway a kingdom by courteous\r\nyielding? If we cannot sway a kingdom by courteous yielding, what is\r\nour courtesy worth?\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, Care not for want of place; care for thy\r\nreadiness to fill one. Care not for being unknown, but seek to be\r\nworthy of note.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, One line, Shen,[37] runs through my Way.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: The disciple Tseng-tzu.]\r\n\r\nYes, said Tseng-tzu.\r\n\r\nAfter the Master had left, the disciples asked what was meant.\r\n\r\nTseng-tzu said, The Master's Way is no more than faithfulness and\r\nfellow-feeling.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, The gentleman is learned in right; the small man\r\nis learned in gain.\r\n\r\n17. The Master said, At sight of worth, think to grow like it; at\r\nsight of baseness, search thyself within.\r\n\r\n18. The Master said, A father or a mother may be gently chidden. If\r\nthou seest they have no will to follow thee, be the more lowly, but do\r\nnot give way; nor murmur at the trouble they give thee.\r\n\r\n19. The Master said, Whilst thy father and mother are living, do not\r\nwander afar. If thou must travel, hold a set course.\r\n\r\n20. The Master said, He that changes nothing in his father's ways for\r\nthree years may be called pious.\r\n\r\n21. The Master said, A father and mother's years must be borne in\r\nmind; with gladness on the one hand and fear on the other.\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, The men of old were loth to speak, for not to\r\nlive up to their words would have shamed them.\r\n\r\n23. The Master said, We shall seldom get lost if we hold to main\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n24. The Master said, A gentleman wishes to be slow to speak and quick\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said, A great soul is never friendless: he has always\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n26. Tzu-yu said, Nagging at kings brings disgrace, nagging at friends\r\nestrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Of Kung-yeh Ch'ang the Master said, A girl might be wedded to him.\r\nThough he has been in fetters that was not his crime.\r\n\r\nHe gave him his daughter to wed.\r\n\r\nOf Nan Jung the Master said, When the land keeps the Way he will not\r\nbe neglected; and if the land loses the Way he will escape punishment\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nHe gave him his brother's daughter to wed.\r\n\r\n2. Of Tzu-chien[38] the Master said, What a gentleman he is! But if\r\nthere were no gentlemen in Lu, where could he have picked it up?\r\n\r\n3. Tzu-kung asked, And what of me?\r\n\r\nThou art a vessel, said the Master.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of vessel?\r\n\r\nA rich temple vessel.\r\n\r\n4. One said, Yung[39] has love, but he is not glib.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: A disciple born in Lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: The disciple Chung-kung.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, What is the good of being glib? Fighting men with\r\ntongue-craft mostly makes men hate you. Whether love be his I do not\r\nknow, but what is the good of being glib?\r\n\r\n5. The Master moved Ch'i-tiao K'ai to take office.\r\n\r\nHe answered, For this I want confidence.\r\n\r\nThe Master was pleased.\r\n\r\n6. The Master said, Forsaken is the Way! I must take ship and stem\r\nthe seas; and Yu[40] shall go with me.\r\n\r\nWhen Tzu-lu heard this he was glad.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Yu loves daring more than I do, but he is at a loss\r\nhow to take things.\r\n\r\n7. Meng Wu asked whether Tzu-lu had love.\r\n\r\nI do not know, said the Master.\r\n\r\nHe asked again.\r\n\r\nA land of a thousand chariots might give Yu charge of its levies; but\r\nwhether love be his I do not know.\r\n\r\nAnd how about Ch'iu?[41]\r\n\r\nA town of a thousand households, a clan of an hundred chariots might\r\nmake Ch'iu governor; but whether love be his I do not know.\r\n\r\nAnd how about Ch'ih?[42]\r\n\r\nStanding in the court, girt with his sash, Ch'ih might entertain the\r\nguests; but whether love be his I do not know.\r\n\r\n8. The Master said to Tzu-kung, Which is the better man, thou or\r\nHui[43]?\r\n\r\nHe answered, How dare I look as high as Hui? When Hui hears one thing,\r\nhe understands ten; when I hear one thing I understand two.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Thou art not his like. Neither art thou his like, nor\r\nam I.\r\n\r\n9. Tsai Yü[44] slept in the daytime.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The disciple Jan Yu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: The disciple Kung-hsi Hua.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: The disciple Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: The disciple Tsai Wo.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Rotten wood cannot be carved, nor are dung walls\r\nplastered. Why chide with Yü?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, When I first met men I listened to their words and\r\ntook their deeds on trust. When I meet them now, I listen to their\r\nwords and watch their deeds. I righted this on Yü.\r\n\r\n10. The Master said, I have met no firm man.\r\n\r\nOne answered, Shen Ch'ang.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Ch'ang is passionate; how can he be firm?\r\n\r\n11. Tzu-kung said, What I do not wish done to me, I likewise wish not\r\nto do to others.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, That is still beyond thee, Tz'u.\r\n\r\n12. Tzu-kung said, To hear the Master on his art and precepts is\r\ngranted us; but to hear him on man's nature and the Way of Heaven is\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n13. Until Tzu-lu could do what he had heard, his only fear was to hear\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n14. Tzu-kung asked, Why was K'ung-wen called cultured?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, He was quick and loved learning; he was not ashamed\r\nto ask those beneath him: that is why he was called cultured.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, Of the ways of a gentleman Tzu-ch'an had four.\r\nHis life was modest; he honoured those that he served. He was kind in\r\nfeeding the people, and he was just in his calls upon them.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, Yen P'ing was a good friend. The longer he knew\r\nyou, the more attentive he grew.\r\n\r\n17. The Master said, Tsang Wen lodged his tortoise with hills on the\r\npillars and reeds on the uprights: was this his wisdom?\r\n\r\n18. Tzu-chang said, The chief minister, Tzu-wen, was thrice made\r\nminister without showing gladness, thrice he left office with unmoved\r\nlooks. He always told the new ministers how the old ones had governed:\r\nhow was that?\r\n\r\nHe was faithful, said the Master.\r\n\r\nBut was it love?\r\n\r\nI do not know, said the Master: how should this amount to love?\r\n\r\nWhen Ts'ui murdered the lord of Ch'i, Ch'en Wen threw up ten teams of\r\nhorses and left the land. On coming to another kingdom he said, 'Like\r\nmy lord Ts'ui,' and left it. On coming to a second kingdom he said\r\nagain, 'Like my lord Ts'ui,' and left it: how was that?\r\n\r\nHe was clean, said the Master.\r\n\r\nBut was it love?\r\n\r\nI do not know, said the Master: how should this amount to love?\r\n\r\n19. Chi Wen thought thrice before acting.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this the Master said, Twice is enough.\r\n\r\n20. The Master said, Whilst the land kept the Way Ning Wu showed\r\nwisdom; when his land lost the Way he grew simple. His wisdom we may\r\ncome up to; such simplicity is beyond us.[45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Ning Wu was minister of the Duke of Wei in the middle of\r\nthe seventh century B.C. The duke was driven from his throne and\r\ndeserted by the wise and prudent; but Ning Wu, in his simplicity,\r\nstuck to his master and finally effected his restoration.]\r\n\r\n21. When he was in Ch'en the Master said, Home, I must go home!\r\nZealous, or rash, or finished scholars, my young sons at home do not\r\nknow what pruning they still need!\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, Because Po-yi and Shu-ch'i never remembered old\r\nwickedness they made few enemies.[46]\r\n\r\n23. The Master said, Who can call Wei-sheng Kao straight? A man begged\r\nhim for vinegar: he begged it of a neighbour, and gave it.\r\n\r\n24. The Master said, Smooth words, fawning looks, and overdone\r\nhumility, Tso Ch'iu-ming thought shameful, and so do I. He thought it\r\nshameful to hide ill-will and ape friendship, and so do I.\r\n\r\n25. As Yen Yüan and Chi-lu[47] were sitting with him, the Master said,\r\nWhy not each of you tell me thy wishes?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Po-yi and Shu-ch'i were sons of the King of Ku-chu.\r\nTheir father left the throne to the younger of the two; but he would\r\nnot supplant the elder, nor would the elder go against his father's\r\nwishes. So they both retired into obscurity. When King Wu overthrew\r\nthe tyrant Chou (1122 B.C.), they starved to death, rather than live\r\nunder a new dynasty. Of Po-yi Mencius tells us (Book X, chapter 1):\r\n'His eyes would not look on an evil face, his ears would not listen to\r\nan evil sound. He served none but his own lord, he ruled none but his\r\nown people. He came in when there was order, and withdrew when tumults\r\ncame. Where lawless rule showed, or lawless people stayed, he could\r\nnot bear to dwell. To be together with country folk he thought like\r\nsitting in court dress and court cap on dust and ashes. In Chou's time\r\nhe dwelt by the North Sea shore, waiting for all below heaven to grow\r\nclean. So, hearing the ways of Po-yi, the fool grows honest, and the\r\nweakling's purpose stands.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\nTzu-lu said, I should like carriages and horses, and clothes of light\r\nfur to share with my friends, and, if they spoiled them, not to get\r\nangry.\r\n\r\nYen Yüan said, I should like to make no boast of talent or show or\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu said, We should like to hear your wishes, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To give the old folk peace, to be true to friends,\r\nand to have a heart for the young.\r\n\r\n26. The Master said, It is finished! I have met no one that can see\r\nhis own faults and arraign himself within.\r\n\r\n27. The Master said, In a hamlet of ten houses there must be men that\r\nare as faithful and true men as I, but they do not love learning as I\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Master said, Yung[48] might fill the seat of a prince.\r\n\r\nAnd might Tzu-sang Po-tzu? asked Chung-kung.\r\n\r\nYes, said the Master; but he is slack.\r\n\r\nTo be stern to himself, said Chung-kung, and slack in his claims on\r\nthe people, might do; but to be slack himself and slack with others\r\nmust surely be too slack.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, What Yung says is true.\r\n\r\n2. Duke Ai asked which disciples loved learning.\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, Yen Hui[49] loved learning. He did not carry over\r\nanger; he made no mistake twice. Alas! his mission was short, he died.\r\nNow that he is gone, I hear of no one that loves learning.\r\n\r\n3. When Tzu-hua[50] was sent to Ch'i, the disciple Jan asked for grain\r\nfor his mother.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Give her six pecks.\r\n\r\nHe asked for more.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Give her sixteen.\r\n\r\nJan gave her eight hundred.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, On his way to Ch'i, Ch'ih[51] was drawn by sleek\r\nhorses and clad in light furs. I have heard that gentlemen help the\r\nneedy, not that they swell riches.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: The disciple Chung-kung.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The disciple Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: The disciple Kung-hsi Hua, or Kung-hsi Ch'ih.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Kung-hei Ch'ih.]\r\n\r\nWhen Yüan Ssu was made governor he was given nine hundred measures of\r\ngrain, which he refused.\r\n\r\nNot so, said the Master: why not take it and give it to thy neighbours\r\nand countryfolk?\r\n\r\n4. The Master said of Chung-kung, If the calf of a brindled cow be red\r\nand horned, though men be shy to offer him, will the hills and streams\r\nreject him?\r\n\r\n5. The Master said, For three months together Hui's[52] heart never\r\nsinned against love. The others may hold out for a day, or a month,\r\nbut no more.\r\n\r\n6. Chi K'ang[53] asked whether Chung-yu[3] was fit to govern.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Yu[54] is firm; what would governing be to him?\r\n\r\nAnd is Tz'u[55] fit to govern?\r\n\r\nTz'u is thorough; what would governing be to him?\r\n\r\nAnd is Ch'iu[56] fit to govern?\r\n\r\nCh'in is clever; what would governing be to him?\r\n\r\n7. The Chi sent to make Min Tzu-ch'ien[6] governor of Pi.\r\n\r\nMin Tzu-ch'ien said, Make some good excuse for me. If he sends again I\r\nmust be across the Wen.\r\n\r\n8. When Po-niu[57] was ill the Master asked after him. Grasping his\r\nhand through the window, he said, He is going. It is the Bidding; but\r\nwhy this man of such an illness? Why this man of such an illness?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The head of the Chi clan after Chi Huan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: The disciple Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: The disciple Tzu-kung.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: The disciple Jan Yu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n9. The Master said. What a man was Hui![58] A bowl of rice, a gourd of\r\nwater, in a low alley; man cannot bear such misery! Yet Hui never fell\r\nfrom mirth. What a man he was!\r\n\r\n10. Jan Ch'iu[59] said, It is not that I take no pleasure in the\r\nMaster's Way: I want strength.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Jan Yu.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, He that wants strength faints midway; but thou\r\ndrawest a line.\r\n\r\n11. The Master said to Tzu-hsia, Study to be a gentleman, not as the\r\nsmall man studies.\r\n\r\n12. When Tzu-yu was governor of Wu-ch'eng, the Master said, Hast thou\r\ngotten any men?\r\n\r\nHe answered, I have Tan-t'ai Mieh-ming. He will not take a short cut\r\nwhen walking, and he has never come to my house except on business.\r\n\r\n13. The Master said, Meng Chih-fan never brags. He was covering the\r\nrear in a rout; but on coming to the gate he whipped his horse and\r\ncried, Not courage kept me behind; my horse won't go!\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, Unless we are glib as the reader T'o and fair as\r\nChao of Sung, escape is hard in the times that be!\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, Who can go out except by the door? Why is it no\r\none keeps to the Way?\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, Matter outweighing art begets roughness; art\r\noutweighing matter begets pedantry. Matter and art well blent make a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n17. The Master said, Man is born straight. If he grows crooked and\r\nyet lives, he is lucky to escape.\r\n\r\n18. The Master said, He that knows is below him that loves, and he\r\nthat loves below him that delights therein.\r\n\r\n19. The Master said, To men above the common we can talk of higher\r\nthings; to men below the common we must not talk of higher things.\r\n\r\n20. Fan Ch'ih[60] asked, What is wisdom?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To foster right among the people; to honour ghosts\r\nand spirits, and yet keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\r\n\r\nHe asked, What is love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To rank the effort above the prize may be called\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n21. The Master said, Wisdom delights in water; love delights in hills.\r\nWisdom is stirring; love is quiet. Wisdom is merry; love grows old.\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, By one revolution Ch'i might grow to be Lu; by\r\none revolution Lu might reach the Way.\r\n\r\n23. The Master said, A drinking horn that is no horn! What a horn!\r\nWhat a drinking horn!\r\n\r\n24. Tsai Wo[61] said, If a man of love were told that a man is in a\r\nwell, would he go in after him?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: A disciple.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Why should he? A gentleman might be got to the well,\r\nbut not trapped into it, He may be cheated, but not fooled.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said, By breadth of reading and the ties of courtesy,\r\na gentleman is kept, too, from false paths.\r\n\r\n26. The Master saw Nan-tzu.[62] Tzu-lu was displeased.\r\n\r\nThe Master took an oath, saying, If I have done wrong, may Heaven\r\nforsake me, may Heaven forsake me!\r\n\r\n27. The Master said, The highest minds cleave to the Centre, the\r\nCommon. They have long been rare among the people.\r\n\r\n28. Tzu-kung said, To treat the people with bounty and help the many,\r\nhow were that? Could it be called love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, What has this to do with love? Must it not be\r\nholiness? Yao and Shun[63] still yearned for this. Seeking a foothold\r\nfor self, love finds a foothold for others; seeking light for itself,\r\nit enlightens others too. To learn from the near at hand may be called\r\nthe clue to love.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: The dissolute wife of Duke Ling of Wei.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Two emperors of the golden age.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Master said, A teller and not a maker, one that trusts and\r\nloves the past; I might liken myself to our old P'eng.[64]\r\n\r\n2. The Master said, To think things over in silence, to learn and be\r\nalways hungry, to teach and never weary; is any of these mine?\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, Not making the most of my mind, want of\r\nthoroughness in learning, failure to do the right when told it, lack\r\nof strength to overcome faults; these are my sorrows.\r\n\r\n4. In his free moments the Master was easy and cheerful.\r\n\r\n5. The Master said, How deep is my decay! It is long since I saw the\r\nDuke of Chou[65] in a dream.\r\n\r\n6. The Master said, Keep thy will on the Way, lean on mind, rest in\r\nlove, move in art.\r\n\r\n7. The Master said, From the man that paid in dried meat upwards, I\r\nhave withheld teaching from no one.\r\n\r\n8. The Master said, Only to those fumbling do I open, only for those\r\nstammering do I find the word.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: We should be glad to know more of old P'eng, but nothing\r\nis known of him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Died 1105 B.C. He was the younger brother of King Wu,\r\nthe founder of the Chou dynasty, as great in peace as the King in war.\r\nHe was so bent on carrying out the old principles of government that\r\n'if anything did not tally with them, he looked up and thought, till\r\nday passed into night, and if by luck he found the answer he sat and\r\nwaited for the dawn' (Mencius, Book VIII, chapter 20).]\r\n\r\nIf I lift one corner and the other three are left unturned, I say no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n9. When eating beside a mourner the Master never ate his fill. On days\r\nwhen he had been wailing, he did not sing.\r\n\r\n10. The Master said to Yen Yüan, To go forward when in office and lie\r\nquiet when not; only I and thou can do that.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu said, If ye had to lead three armies, Sir, whom would ye have\r\nwith you?\r\n\r\nNo man, said the Master, that would face a tiger bare-fisted, or\r\nplunge into a river and die without a qualm; but one, indeed, who,\r\nfearing what may come, lays his plans well and carries them through.\r\n\r\n11. The Master said, If shouldering a whip were a sure road to riches\r\nI should turn carter; but since there is no sure road, I tread the\r\npath I love.\r\n\r\n12. The Master gave heed to abstinence, war and sickness.\r\n\r\n13. When he was in Ch'i, for three months after hearing the Shao\r\nplayed, the Master knew not the taste of flesh.\r\n\r\nI did not suppose, he said, that music could reach such heights.\r\n\r\n14. Jan Yu said, Is the Master for the lord of Wei?[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The grandson of Duke Ling, the husband of Nan-tzu. His\r\nfather had been driven from the country for plotting to kill Nan-tzu.\r\nWhen Duke Ling died, he was succeeded by his grandson, who opposed by\r\nforce his father's attempts to seize the throne.]\r\n\r\nI shall ask him, said Tzu-kung.\r\n\r\nHe went in, and said, What kind of men were Po-yi[67] and Shu-ch'i?\r\n\r\nWorthy men of yore, said the Master.\r\n\r\nDid they rue the past?\r\n\r\nThey sought love and found it; what had they to rue?\r\n\r\nTzu-kung went out, and said, The Master is not for him.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, Eating coarse rice and drinking water, with bent\r\narm for pillow, we may be merry; but ill-gotten wealth and honours are\r\nto me a wandering cloud.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, Given a few more years, making fifty for learning\r\nthe Yi,[68] I might be freed from gross faults.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: See Book V, § 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: An abstruse, ancient classic, usually called the Book of\r\nChanges.]\r\n\r\n17. The Master liked to talk of poetry, history, and the upkeep of\r\ncourtesy. Of all these he liked to talk.\r\n\r\n18. The Duke of She asked Tzu-lu about Confucius.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu did not answer.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Why didst thou not say, He is a man that forgets to\r\neat in his eagerness, whose sorrows are forgotten in gladness, who\r\nknows not that age draws near?\r\n\r\n19. The Master said, I was not born to wisdom: I loved the past, and\r\nsought it earnestly there.\r\n\r\n20. The Master never talked of goblins, strength, disorder, or\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n21. The Master said, Walking three together I am sure of teachers. I\r\npick out the good and follow it; I see the bad and shun it.\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, Heaven begat the mind in me; what can Huan\r\nT'ui[69] do to me?\r\n\r\n23. The Master said, My two-three boys, do ye think I hide things? I\r\nhide nothing from you. I am a man that keeps none of his doings from\r\nhis two-three boys.\r\n\r\n24. The Master taught four things: art, conduct, faithfulness and\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said, A holy man I shall not live to see; enough could\r\nI find a gentleman! A good man I shall not live to see; enough could I\r\nfind a steadfast one! But when nothing poses as something, cloud as\r\nsubstance and want as riches, it is hard indeed to be steadfast!\r\n\r\n26. The Master angled, but he did not fish with a net; he shot, but\r\nnot at birds sitting.\r\n\r\n27. The Master said, There may be men that do things without knowing\r\nwhy. I do not. To hear much, pick out the good and follow it; to see\r\nmuch and think it over; this comes next to wisdom.\r\n\r\n28. To talk to the Hu village was hard. When a lad was seen by the\r\nMaster, the disciples doubted.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, I allow his coming, not what he does later. Why be so\r\nharsh? If a man cleans himself to come in, I admit his cleanness, but\r\ndo not warrant his past.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: In 495 B.C., during Confucius's wanderings, Huan T'ui\r\nsent a band of men to kill him; but why he did so is not known.]\r\n\r\n29. The Master said, Is love so far a thing? I long for love, and lo!\r\nlove is come.\r\n\r\n30. A judge of Ch'en asked whether Duke Chao[70] knew good form.\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, He knew good form.\r\n\r\nAfter Confucius had left, the judge beckoned Wu-ma Ch'i[71] to him,\r\nand said, I had heard that gentlemen are of no party, but do they,\r\ntoo, take sides? This lord married a Wu, whose name was the same as\r\nhis, and called her Miss Tzu of Wu: if he knew good form, who does not\r\nknow good form?\r\n\r\nWhen Wu-ma Ch'i told the Master this he said, How lucky I am! If I go\r\nwrong, men are sure to know it!\r\n\r\n31. When anyone sang to the Master, and sang well, he made him sing it\r\nagain and joined in.\r\n\r\n32. The Master said, I have no more reading than others; to live as a\r\ngentleman is not yet mine.\r\n\r\n33. The Master said, How dare I lay claim to holiness or love? A man\r\nof endless craving, who never tires of teaching, I might be called,\r\nbut that is all.\r\n\r\nThat is just what we disciples cannot learn, said Kung-hsi Hua.\r\n\r\n34. When the Master was very ill, Tzu-lu asked leave to pray.\r\n\r\nIs it done? said the Master.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Duke Chao of Lu (+ 510 B.C.) was the duke that first\r\nemployed Confucius. It is against Chinese custom for a man to marry a\r\ngirl whose surname is the same as his.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: A disciple of Confucius.]\r\n\r\nIt is, answered Tzu-lu. The Memorials say, Pray to the spirits above\r\nand to the Earth below.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Long-lasting has my prayer been.\r\n\r\n35. The Master said, Waste makes men unruly, thrift makes them mean;\r\nbut they are better mean than unruly.\r\n\r\n36. The Master said, A gentleman is calm and spacious; the small man\r\nis always fretting.\r\n\r\n37. The Master's manner was warm yet dignified. He was stern, but not\r\nfierce; humble, yet easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Master said, T'ai-po[72] may be said to have carried nobility\r\nfurthest. Thrice he refused all below heaven. Men were at a loss how\r\nto praise him.\r\n\r\n2. The Master said, Without good form attentions grow into fussiness,\r\nheed becomes fearfulness, daring becomes unruliness, frankness becomes\r\nrudeness. When gentlemen are true to kinsfolk, love will thrive among\r\nthe people; if they do not forsake old friends, the people will not\r\nsteal.\r\n\r\n3. When Tseng-tzu lay sick he called his disciples and said, Uncover\r\nmy feet, uncover my arms. The poem says,\r\n\r\n    As if a deep gulf\r\n      Were yawning below,\r\n    As crossing thin ice,\r\n      Take heed how ye go.\r\n\r\nMy little children, I have known how to keep myself unhurt until now\r\nand hereafter.[73]\r\n\r\n4. When Tseng-tzu was sick Meng Ching[74] came to ask after him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: T'ai-po was the eldest son of the King of Chou. The\r\nfather wished his third son to succeed him, so that the throne might\r\npass later to his grandson, afterwards known as King Wen. To enable\r\nthis plan to be carried out T'ai-po and his second brother went into\r\nexile.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: The Chinese say: 'The body is born whole by the mother;\r\nit should be returned whole by the son.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Chief of the Meng clan, minister of Lu.]\r\n\r\nTseng-tzu said, When a bird is dying his notes are sad; when man is\r\ndying his words are good. Three branches of the Way are dear to a\r\ngentleman: To banish from his bearing violence and disdain; to sort\r\nhis face to the truth, and to banish from his speech what is low or\r\nunseemly. The ritual of chalice and platter[75] has servitors to see\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n5. Tseng-tzu said, When we can, to ask those that cannot; when we are\r\nmore, to ask those that are less; having, to seem wanting; real, to\r\nseem shadow; when gainsaid, never answering back; I had a friend[76]\r\nonce that could do thus.\r\n\r\n6. Tseng-tzu said, A man to whom an orphan, a few feet high, or the\r\nfate of an hundred towns, may be entrusted, and whom no crisis can\r\ncorrupt, is he not a gentleman, a gentleman indeed?\r\n\r\n7. Tseng-tzu said, The knight had need be strong and bold; for his\r\nburden is heavy, the way is far. His burden is love, is it not a heavy\r\none? No halt before death, is that not far?\r\n\r\n8. The Master said, Poetry rouses us, we stand upon courtesy, music is\r\nour crown.\r\n\r\n9. The Master said, The people may be made to follow, we cannot make\r\nthem understand.\r\n\r\n10. The Master said, Love of daring and hatred of poverty lead to\r\ncrime; a man without love, if he is sorely harassed, turns to crime.\r\n\r\n11. The Master said, All the comely gifts of the Duke of Chou,[77]\r\ncoupled with pride and meanness, would not be worth a glance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: For sacrifice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Probably Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: See Book VII, § 5.]\r\n\r\n12. The Master said, A man to whom three years of learning have borne\r\nno fruit would be hard to find.\r\n\r\n13. The Master said, A man of simple faith, who loves learning, who\r\nguards and betters his way unto death, will not enter a tottering\r\nkingdom, nor stay in a lawless land. When all below heaven follows the\r\nWay, he is seen; when it loses the Way, he is unseen. While his land\r\nkeeps the Way, he is ashamed to be poor and lowly; but when his land\r\nhas lost the Way, wealth and honours shame him.\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, When out of place, discuss not policy.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, In the first days of the music-master Chih how\r\nthe hubbub[78] of the Kuan-chü rose sea beyond sea! How it filled the\r\near!\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, Of men that are zealous, but not straight; dull,\r\nbut not simple; helpless, but not truthful, I will know nothing.\r\n\r\n17. The Master said, Learn as though the time were short, like one\r\nthat fears to lose.\r\n\r\n18. The Master said, How wonderful were Shun[2] and Yü[2]! To have all\r\nbelow heaven was nothing to them!\r\n\r\n19. The Master said, How great a lord was Yao[79]! Wonderful! Heaven\r\nalone is great; Yao alone was patterned on it. Vast, boundless! Men's\r\nwords failed them. The wonder of the work done by him! The flame of\r\nhis art and precepts!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: The last part of the music, when all the instruments\r\nwere played together.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: See Introduction.]\r\n\r\n20. Shun had five ministers, and there was order below heaven.\r\n\r\nKing Wu[80] said, I have ten uncommon ministers.\r\n\r\nConfucius said, 'The dearth of talent,' is not that the truth? When\r\nYü[81] followed T'ang[82] the times were rich in talent; yet there\r\nwere but nine men in all, and one woman. In greatness of soul we may\r\nsay that Chou[83] was highest: he had two-thirds of all below heaven\r\nand bent it to the service of Yin.\r\n\r\n21. The Master said, I see no flaw in Yü. He ate and drank little, yet\r\nhe was lavish in piety to the ghosts and spirits. His clothes were\r\nbad, but in his cap and gown he was fair indeed. His palace buildings\r\nwere poor, yet he gave his whole strength to dykes and ditches. No\r\nkind of flaw can I see in Yü.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: See Introduction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Shun.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Yao.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: King Wen, Duke of Chou.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Master seldom spake of gain, or love, or the Bidding.\r\n\r\n2. A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, The great Confucius, with\r\nhis vast learning, has made no name in anything.\r\n\r\nWhen the Master heard this, he said to his disciples, What shall I\r\ntake up? Shall I take up driving, or shall I take up shooting? I shall\r\ntake up driving.\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, A linen cap is good form; now silk is worn. It is\r\ncheap, so I follow the many. To bow below is good form; now it is done\r\nabove. This is arrogance, so, breaking with the many, I still bow\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n4. From four things the Master was quite free: by-ends and 'must' and\r\n'shall' and 'I.'\r\n\r\n5. When he was afraid in K'uang,[84] the Master said, Since the death\r\nof King Wen, is not the seat of culture here? If Heaven had meant to\r\ndestroy our culture, a later mortal would have had no part in it.\r\nUntil Heaven condemns our culture, what can the men of K'uang do to\r\nme?\r\n\r\n6. A high minister said to Tzu-kung, The Master must be a holy man, he\r\ncan do so many things!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: During the Master's wanderings. K'uang is said to have\r\nbeen a small state near Lu which had been oppressed by Yang Huo.\r\nConfucius resembled him, and the men of K'uang set upon him, mistaking\r\nhim for their enemy. The commentators say that the Master was not\r\nafraid, only 'roused to a sense of danger.' I cannot find that the\r\ntext says so.]\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, Heaven has, indeed, given him so much that he is almost\r\nholy, and he can do many things, too.\r\n\r\nWhen the Master heard this, he said, Does the minister know me?\r\nBecause I was poor when young, I can do many paltry things. But does\r\ndoing many things make a gentleman? No, not doing many does.\r\n\r\nLao said, The Master would say, As I had no post I learned the crafts.\r\n\r\n7. The Master said, Have I in truth wisdom? I have no wisdom. But when\r\na common fellow emptily asks me anything, I tap it on this side and\r\nthat, and sift it to the bottom.\r\n\r\n8. The Master said, The phoenix comes not, the River gives forth no\r\nsign: all is over with me!\r\n\r\n9. When the Master saw folk clad in mourning, or in cap and gown, or a\r\nblind man, he always rose--even for the young,--or, if he was passing\r\nthem, he quickened his step.\r\n\r\n10. Yen Yüan heaved a sigh, and said, As I look up it grows higher,\r\ndeeper as I dig! I catch sight of it ahead, and on a sudden it is\r\nbehind me! The Master leads men on, deftly bit by bit. He widens me\r\nwith culture, he binds me with courtesy. If I wished to stop I could\r\nnot until my strength were spent. What seems the mark stands near; but\r\nthough I long to reach it, I find no way.\r\n\r\n11. When the Master was very ill, Tzu-lu made the disciples act as\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nDuring a better spell the Master said, Yu has long been feigning.\r\nThis show of ministers, when I have no ministers, whom will it take\r\nin? Will Heaven be taken in? And is it not better to die in the arms\r\nof my two-three boys than to die in the arms of ministers? And, if I\r\nmiss a big burial, shall I die by the roadside?\r\n\r\n12. Tzu-kung said, If I had here a fair piece of jade, should I hide\r\nit away in a case, or seek a good price and sell it?\r\n\r\nSell it, sell it! said the Master. I tarry for my price.\r\n\r\n13. The Master wished to dwell among the nine tribes.[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: In the east of Shantung.]\r\n\r\nOne said, They are low; how could ye?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Wherever a gentleman lives, will there be anything\r\nlow?\r\n\r\n14. The Master said. After I came back from Wei to Lu the music was\r\nset straight and each song found its place.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, To serve dukes and ministers abroad and father\r\nand brothers at home; in matters of mourning not to dare to be slack;\r\nand to be no thrall to wine: to which of these have I won?\r\n\r\n16. As he stood by a stream, the Master said, Hasting away like this,\r\nday and night, without stop!\r\n\r\n17. The Master said, I have seen no one that loves mind as he loves\r\nlooks.\r\n\r\n18. The Master said, In making a mound, if I stop when one more basket\r\nwould finish it, I stop. When flattening ground, if, after\r\noverturning one basket, I go on, I go ahead.\r\n\r\n19. The Master said, Never listless when spoken to, such was Hui.[86]\r\n\r\n20. Speaking of Yen Yüan, the Master said, The pity of it! I saw him\r\ngo on, but I never saw him stop!\r\n\r\n21. The Master said, Some sprouts do not blossom, some blossoms bear\r\nno fruit!\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, Awe is due to youth. May not to-morrow be bright\r\nas to-day? To men of forty or fifty, who are still unknown, no awe is\r\ndue.\r\n\r\n23. The Master said, Who would not give ear to a downright word? But\r\nto mend is better. Who would not be pleased by a guiding word? But to\r\nthink it out is better. With such as are pleased but do not think out,\r\nor who listen but do not mend, I can do nothing.\r\n\r\n24. The Master said, Put faithfulness and truth first; have no friends\r\nunlike thyself; be not ashamed to mend thy faults.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said, Three armies may be robbed of their leader, no\r\nwretch can be robbed of his will.\r\n\r\n26. The Master said, Yu[87] is the man to stand, clad in a worn-out\r\nquilted gown, unashamed, amid robes of fox and badger!\r\n\r\n    Without hatred or greed,\r\n    What but good does he do?\r\n\r\nBut when Tzu-lu was everlastingly humming these words, the Master\r\nsaid, This is the way towards it, but how much short of goodness\r\nitself!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n27. The Master said, Erst the cold days show how fir and cypress are\r\nlast to fade.\r\n\r\n28. The Master said, Wisdom has no doubts; love does not fret; the\r\nbold have no fears.\r\n\r\n29. The Master said, With some we can learn together, but we cannot go\r\ntheir way; we can go the same way with others, though our standpoint\r\nis not the same; and with some, though our standpoint is the same our\r\nweights and scales are not.\r\n\r\n30.\r\n\r\n    The blossoms of the plum tree\r\n      Are dancing in play;\r\n    My thoughts are with thee,\r\n      In thy home far away.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Her thoughts were not with him, or how could he be\r\nfar away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Among his own country folk Confucius wore a homely look, like one\r\nthat has no word to say.\r\n\r\nIn the ancestral temple and at court his speech was full, but\r\ncautious.\r\n\r\n2. At court he talked frankly to men of low rank, winningly to men of\r\nhigh rank. When the king was there, he looked intent and solemn.\r\n\r\n3. When the king bade him receive guests, his face seemed to change\r\nand his legs to bend. He bowed left and right to those beside him,\r\nstraightened his robes in front and behind, and swept forward, with\r\narms spread like wings. When the guest had left, he brought back word,\r\nsaying, The guest is no longer looking.\r\n\r\n4. As he went in at the palace gate he stooped, as though it were too\r\nlow for him. He did not stand in the middle of the gate, or step on\r\nthe threshold.\r\n\r\nWhen he passed the throne, his face seemed to change and his legs to\r\nbend: he spake with bated breath. As he went up the hall to audience,\r\nhe lifted his robes, bowed his back, and masked his breathing till it\r\nseemed to stop. As he came down, he relaxed his face below the first\r\nstep and looked pleased. From the foot of the steps he swept forward\r\nwith arms spread like wings; and when he was back in his seat, he\r\nlooked intent as before.\r\n\r\n5. When he carried the sceptre, his back bent, as under too heavy a\r\nburden; he lifted it no higher than in bowing and no lower than in\r\nmaking a gift. His face changed, as it will with fear, and he dragged\r\nhis feet, as though they were fettered.\r\n\r\nWhen he offered his present his manner was formal; but at the private\r\naudience he was cheerful.\r\n\r\n6. The gentleman was never decked in violet or mauve; even at home he\r\nwould not wear red or purple.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather he wore an unlined linen gown, but always over other\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nWith lamb-skin he wore black, with fawn, white, and with fox-skin,\r\nyellow. At home he wore a long fur gown, with the right sleeve short.\r\n\r\nHis nightgown was always half as long again as his body.\r\n\r\nIn the house he wore thick fur, of fox or badger.\r\n\r\nWhen he was not in mourning there was nothing missing from his girdle.\r\n\r\nExcept for sacrificial dress, he was sparing of stuff.\r\n\r\nHe did not wear lamb's fur, or a black cap, on a mourning visit.\r\n\r\nAt the new moon he always put on court dress and went to court.\r\n\r\n7. On his days of abstinence he always wore linen clothes of a pale\r\ncolour; and he changed his food and moved from his wonted seat.\r\n\r\n8. He did not dislike well-cleaned rice or hash chopped small. He did\r\nnot eat sour or mouldy rice, bad fish, or tainted flesh. He did not\r\neat anything that had a bad colour or that smelt bad, or food that\r\nwas badly cooked or out of season. Food that was badly cut or served\r\nwith the wrong sauce he did not eat. However much flesh there might\r\nbe, it could not conquer his taste for rice. To wine alone he set no\r\nlimit, but he did not drink enough to muddle him. He did not drink\r\nbought wine, or eat ready-dried market meat. He never went without\r\nginger at a meal. He did not eat much.\r\n\r\nAfter a sacrifice at the palace he did not keep the flesh over-night.\r\nHe never kept sacrificial flesh more than three days. If it had been\r\nkept longer it was not eaten.\r\n\r\nHe did not talk at meals, nor speak when he was in bed.\r\n\r\nEven at a meal of coarse rice, or herb broth, or gourds, he made his\r\noffering with all reverence.\r\n\r\n9. If his mat was not straight, he would not sit down.\r\n\r\n10. When the villagers were drinking wine, as those that walked with a\r\nstaff left, he left too.\r\n\r\nAt the village exorcisms he put on court dress and stood on the east\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n11. When sending a man with enquiries to another land, he bowed twice\r\nto him and saw him out.\r\n\r\nWhen K'ang gave him some drugs, he bowed, accepted them, and said, I\r\nhave never taken them; I dare not taste them.\r\n\r\n12. On coming back from court after his stables had been burnt, the\r\nMaster said, Is anyone hurt? He did not ask about the horses.\r\n\r\n13. When the king sent him cooked meat, he put his mat straight, and\r\ntasted it first; when he sent him raw flesh, he had it cooked, and\r\noffered it to the spirits; when he sent him a live beast, he kept it\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nWhen he ate in attendance on the king, the king made the offering, he\r\ntasted things first.\r\n\r\nWhen he was sick and the king came to see him, he lay with his head to\r\nthe east, with his court dress over him and his girdle across it.\r\n\r\nWhen he was called by the king's bidding, he walked, without waiting\r\nfor his carriage.\r\n\r\n14. On going into the Great Temple he asked about everything.\r\n\r\n15. When a friend died, who had no home to go to, he said, It is for\r\nme to bury him.\r\n\r\nWhen friends sent him anything, even a carriage and horses, he never\r\nbowed, unless the gift was sacrificial flesh.\r\n\r\n16. He did not sleep like a corpse. At home he unbent.\r\n\r\nEven if he knew him well, his face changed when he saw a mourner. Even\r\nwhen he was in undress, if he saw anyone in full dress, or a blind\r\nman, he looked grave.\r\n\r\nTo men in deep mourning and to the census-bearers he bowed over the\r\ncross-bar.\r\n\r\nBefore choice meats he rose with changed look. At sharp thunder, or a\r\nfierce wind, his look changed.\r\n\r\n17. When mounting his carriage he stood straight and grasped the cord.\r\nWhen he was in it, he did not look round, or speak fast, or point.\r\n\r\n18. Seeing a man's face, she rose, flew round and settled. The Master\r\nsaid, Hen pheasant on the ridge, it is the season, it is the season.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu went towards her: she sniffed thrice and rose.[88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: This passage cannot belong here. It is corrupt and\r\nunintelligible.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XI\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Master said, Savages! the men that first went into courtesy and\r\nmusic! Gentlemen! those that went into them later! My use is to follow\r\nthe first lead in both.\r\n\r\n2. The Master said, Not one of my followers in Ch'en or Ts'ai comes\r\nany more to my door! Yen Yüan, Min Tzu-ch'ien, Jan Po-niu and\r\nChung-kung were men of noble life; Tsai Wo and Tzu-kung were the\r\ntalkers; Jan Yu and Chi-lu were statesmen; Tzu-yu and Tzu-hsia, men of\r\narts and learning.\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, I get no help from Hui.[89] No word I say but\r\ndelights him!\r\n\r\n4. The Master said, How good a son is Min Tzu-ch'ien! No one finds\r\nfault with anything that his father, or his mother, or his brethren\r\nsay of him.\r\n\r\n5. Nan Jung would thrice repeat _The Sceptre White_.[90] Confucius\r\ngave him his brother's daughter for wife.\r\n\r\n6. Chi K'ang asked which disciples loved learning. Confucius answered,\r\nThere was Yen Hui[91] loved learning. Alas! his mission was short, he\r\ndied. Now there is no one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: The verse runs--\r\n\r\n    A flaw can be ground\r\n      From a sceptre white;\r\n    A slip of the tongue\r\n      No man can right.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n7. When Yen Yüan died, Yen Lu[92] asked for the Master's carriage to\r\nfurnish an outer coffin.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Brains or no brains, each of us speaks of his son.\r\nWhen Li[93] died he had an inner but not an outer coffin: I would not\r\ngo on foot to furnish an outer coffin. As I follow in the wake of the\r\nministers I cannot go on foot.\r\n\r\n8. When Yen Yüan died the Master said, Woe is me! Heaven has undone\r\nme! Heaven has undone me!\r\n\r\n9. When Yen Yüan died the Master gave way to grief.\r\n\r\nHis followers said, Sir, ye are giving way.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Am I giving way? If I did not give way for this man,\r\nfor whom should I give way to grief?\r\n\r\n10. When Yen Yüan died the disciples wished to bury him in pomp.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, This must not be.\r\n\r\nThe disciples buried him in pomp.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Hui treated me as his father. I have failed to treat\r\nhim as a son. No, not I; but ye, my two-three boys.\r\n\r\n11. Chi-lu[94] asked what is due to the ghosts of the dead?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, When we cannot do our duty to the living, how can we\r\ndo it to the dead?\r\n\r\nHe dared to ask about death.\r\n\r\nWe know not life, said the Master, how can we know death?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: The father of Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: The Master's son.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n12. Seeing the disciple Min standing at his side with winning looks,\r\nTzu-lu with warlike front, Jan Yu and Tzu-kung frank and free, the\r\nMaster's heart was glad.\r\n\r\nA man like Yu,[95] he said, dies before his day.\r\n\r\n13. The men of Lu were building the Long Treasury.\r\n\r\nMin Tzu-ch'ien said, Would not the old one do? Why must it be rebuilt?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, That man does not talk, but when he speaks he hits\r\nthe mark.\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, What has the lute of Yu[96] to do, twanging at my\r\ndoor?\r\n\r\nBut when the disciples looked down on Tzu-lu, the Master said, Yu has\r\ncome up into hall, but he has not yet entered the inner rooms.\r\n\r\n15. Tzu-kung asked, Which is the better, Shih[97] or Shang[98]?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Shih goes too far, Shang not far enough.\r\n\r\nThen is Shih the better? said Tzu-kung.\r\n\r\nToo far, said the Master, is no nearer than not far enough.\r\n\r\n16. The Chi was richer than the Duke of Chou; yet Ch'iu[99] became his\r\ntax-gatherer and made him still richer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Tzu-lu. This prophecy came true. Tzu-lu and Tzu-kao were\r\nofficers of Wei when troubles arose. Tzu-lu hastened to the help of\r\nhis master. He met Tzu-kao withdrawing from the danger, and was\r\nadvised to do the same. But Tzu-lu would not desert the man whose pay\r\nhe drew. He plunged into the fight and was killed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: The disciple Tzu-chang.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: The disciple Tzu-hsia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: The disciple Jan Yu.]\r\n\r\nHe is no disciple of mine, said the Master. My little children, ye may\r\nbeat your drums and make war on him.\r\n\r\n17. Ch'ai[100] is simple, Shen[101] is dull, Shih[102] is smooth,\r\nYu[103] is coarse.\r\n\r\n18. The Master said, Hui[104] is almost faultless, and he is often\r\nempty. Tz'u[105] will not bow to the Bidding, and he heaps up riches;\r\nbut his views are often sound.\r\n\r\n19. Tzu-chang asked, What is the way of a good man?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, He does not tread the beaten track; and yet he does\r\nnot enter the inner rooms.\r\n\r\n20. The Master said, Commend a man for plain speaking: he may prove a\r\ngentleman, or else but seeming honest.\r\n\r\n21. Tzu-lu said, Shall I do all I am taught?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Whilst thy father and elder brothers live, how canst\r\nthou do all thou art taught?\r\n\r\nJan Yu asked, Shall I do all I am taught?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Do all thou art taught.\r\n\r\nKung-hsi Hua said, Yu[106] asked, Shall I do all I am taught? and ye\r\nsaid, Sir, Whilst thy father and elder brothers live. Ch'iu[107]\r\nasked, Shall I do all I am taught? and ye said, Sir, Do all thou art\r\ntaught. I am in doubt, and dare to ask you, Sir.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: The disciple Kao Ch'ai]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: The disciple Tseng-tzu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: The disciple Tzu-chang.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: The disciple Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: The disciple Yen Yüan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: The disciple Tzu-kung.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Jan Yu.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Ch'iu is bashful, so I egged him on; Yu is twice a\r\nman, so I held him back.\r\n\r\n22. When the Master was in fear in K'uang, Yen Yüan fell behind.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, I held thee for dead.\r\n\r\nHe answered, Whilst my Master lives how should I dare to die?\r\n\r\n23. Chi Tzu-jan[108] asked whether Chung Yu[2] or Jan Ch'iu[3] could\r\nbe called a great minister.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, I thought ye would ask me a riddle, Sir, and ye ask\r\nabout Yu[109] and Ch'iu.[110] He that holds to the Way in serving his\r\nlord and leaves when he cannot do so, we call a great minister. Now Yu\r\nand Ch'iu I should call tools.\r\n\r\nWho are just followers then?\r\n\r\nNor would they follow, said the Master, if told to kill their lord or\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n24. Tzu-lu made Tzu-kao governor of Pi.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Thou art undoing a man's son.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu said, What with the people and the spirits of earth and corn,\r\nmust a man read books to become learned?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, This is why I hate a glib tongue.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said to Tzu-lu, Tseng Hsi,[111] Jan Yu and Kung-hsi Hua\r\nas they sat beside him, I may be a day older than you, but forget\r\nthat. Ye are wont to say, I am unknown. Well, if ye were known, what\r\nwould ye do?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: The younger brother of Chi Huan, the head of the Chi\r\nclan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Tzu-lu. He and Jan Yu had taken office under the Chi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Jan Yu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: A disciple: the father of Tseng-tzu.]\r\n\r\nTzu-lu answered lightly. Give me a land of a thousand chariots,\r\ncrushed between great neighbours, overrun by soldiers and searched by\r\nfamine, and within three years I could put courage into it and high\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe Master smiled.\r\n\r\nWhat wouldst thou do, Ch'iu[112]? he said.\r\n\r\nHe answered, Give me a land of sixty or seventy, or fifty or sixty\r\nsquare miles, and within three years I could give the people plenty.\r\nAs for courtesy and music, they would wait the coming of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nAnd what wouldst thou do, Ch'ih[113]?\r\n\r\nHe answered, I do not speak of what I can do, but of what I should\r\nlike to learn. At services in the Ancestral Temple, or at the Grand\r\nAudience, I should like to fill a small part.\r\n\r\nAnd what wouldst thou do, Tien[114]?\r\n\r\nTien stopped playing, pushed his still sounding lute aside, rose and\r\nanswered, My choice would be unlike those of the other three.\r\n\r\nWhat harm in that? said the Master. Each but spake his mind.\r\n\r\nIn the last days of spring, all clad for the springtime, with five or\r\nsix young men and six or seven lads, I would bathe in the Yi, be\r\nfanned by the wind in the Rain God's glade, and go back home singing.\r\n\r\nThe Master said with a sigh, I side with Tien.\r\n\r\nTseng Hsi stayed after the other three had left, and said, What did ye\r\nthink, Sir, of what the three disciples said?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Jan Yu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Kung-hsi Hua.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Tseng Hsi.]\r\n\r\nEach but spake his mind, said the Master.\r\n\r\nWhy did ye smile at Yu,[115] Sir?\r\n\r\nLands are swayed by courtesy, but what he said was not modest. That\r\nwas why I smiled. Yet did not Ch'iu speak of a state? Where would\r\nsixty or seventy, or fifty or sixty, square miles be found that are\r\nnot a state? And did not Ch'ih too speak of a state? Who but great\r\nvassals are there in the Ancestral Temple, or at the Grand Audience?\r\nBut if Ch'ih were to take a small part, who could fill a big one?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XII\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Yen Yüan asked, What is love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Love is to conquer self and turn to courtesy. If we\r\ncould conquer self and turn to courtesy for one day, all below heaven\r\nwould turn to love. Does love flow from within, or does it flow from\r\nothers?\r\n\r\nYen Yüan said, May I ask what are its signs?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To be always courteous of eye and courteous of ear;\r\nto be always courteous in word and courteous in deed.\r\n\r\nYen Yüan said, Though I am not clever, I hope to live by these words.\r\n\r\n2. Chung-kung asked, What is love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Without the door to behave as though a great guest\r\nwere come; to treat the people as though we tendered the great\r\nsacrifice; not to do unto others what we would not they should do unto\r\nus; to breed no wrongs in the state and breed no wrongs in the home.\r\n\r\nChung-kung said, Though I am not clever, I hope to live by these\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n3. Ssu-ma Niu[116] asked, What is love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Love is slow to speak.\r\n\r\nTo be slow to speak! Can that be called love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Can that which is hard to do be lightly spoken?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n4. Ssu-ma Niu asked, What is a gentleman?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, A gentleman knows neither sorrow nor fear.\r\n\r\nNo sorrow and no fear! Can that be called a gentleman?\r\n\r\nThe Master said. He searches his heart: it is blameless; so why should\r\nhe sorrow, what should he fear?\r\n\r\n5. Ssu-ma Niu cried sadly, All men have brothers, I alone have none!\r\n\r\nTzu-hsia said, I have heard that life and death are allotted, that\r\nwealth and honours are in Heaven's hand. A gentleman is careful and\r\ndoes not trip; he is humble towards others and courteous. All within\r\nthe four seas are brethren; how can a gentleman lament that he has\r\nnone?\r\n\r\n6. Tzu-chang asked, What is insight?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Not to be moved by lap and wash of slander, or by\r\nplaints that pierce to the quick, may be called insight. Yea, whom lap\r\nand wash of slander, or plaints that pierce to the quick cannot move\r\nmay be called far-sighted.\r\n\r\n7. Tzu-kung asked, What is kingcraft?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Food enough, troops enough, and the trust of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, If it had to be done, which could best be spared of the\r\nthree?\r\n\r\nTroops, said the Master.\r\n\r\nAnd if we had to, which could better be spared of the other two?\r\n\r\nFood, said the Master. From of old all men die, but without trust a\r\npeople cannot stand.\r\n\r\n8. Chi Tzu-ch'eng[117] said, It is the stuff alone that makes a\r\ngentleman; what can art do for him?\r\n\r\nAlas! my lord, said Tzu-kung, how ye speak of a gentleman! No team\r\novertakes the tongue! The art is no less than the stuff, the stuff is\r\nno less than the art. Without the fur, a tiger or a leopard's hide is\r\nno better than the hide of a dog or a goat.\r\n\r\n9. Duke Ai said to Yu Jo,[118] In this year of dearth I have not\r\nenough for my wants; what should be done?\r\n\r\nYe might tithe the people, answered Yu Jo.\r\n\r\nA fifth is not enough, said the Duke, how could I do with a tenth?\r\n\r\nWhen all his folk have enough, answered Yu Jo, shall the lord alone\r\nnot have enough? When none of his folk have enough, shall the lord\r\nalone have enough?\r\n\r\n10. Tzu-chang asked how to raise the mind and scatter delusions.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Put faithfulness and truth first, and follow the\r\nright; the mind will be raised. We wish life to what we love and death\r\nto what we hate. To wish it both life and death is a delusion.\r\n\r\n    Whether prompted by wealth, or not,\r\n    Yet ye made a distinction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Minister of Wei.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: A disciple of Confucius.]\r\n\r\n11. Ching,[119] Duke of Ch'i, asked Confucius, What is kingcraft?\r\n\r\nConfucius answered. For the lord to be lord and the liege, liege, the\r\nfather to be father and the son, son.\r\n\r\nTrue indeed! said the Duke. If the lord were no lord and the liege no\r\nliege, the father no father and the son no son, though the grain were\r\nthere, could I get anything to eat?\r\n\r\n12. The Master said, To stint a quarrel with half a word Yu[120] is\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu never slept over a promise.\r\n\r\n13. The Master said, At hearing lawsuits I am no better than others.\r\nWhat is needed is to stop lawsuits.\r\n\r\n14. Tzu-chang asked, What is kingcraft?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To be tireless of thought and faithful in doing.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, Breadth of reading and the ties of courtesy will\r\nkeep us, too, from false paths.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, A gentleman shapes the good in man, he does not\r\nshape the bad in him. The small man does the contrary.\r\n\r\n17. Chi K'ang[121] asked Confucius how to rule.\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, To rule is to set straight. If ye give a straight\r\nlead, Sir, who will dare not go straight?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Confucius was in Ch'i in 517 B.C. The duke was\r\nover-shadowed by his ministers and thought of setting aside his eldest\r\nson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: On the death of Chi Huan, his brother Chi K'ang set\r\naside Chi Huan's small son and made himself head of the clan.]\r\n\r\n18. Chi K'ang being troubled by robbers asked Confucius about it.\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, If ye did not wish it, Sir, though ye rewarded him\r\nno man would steal.\r\n\r\n19. Chi K'ang, speaking of kingcraft to Confucius, said, To help those\r\nthat follow the Way, should we kill the men that will not?\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, Sir, what need has a ruler to kill? If ye wished\r\nfor goodness, Sir, the people would be good. The gentleman's mind is\r\nthe wind, and grass are the minds of small men: as the wind blows, so\r\nmust the grass bend.\r\n\r\n20. Tzu-chang asked, What must a knight be, for him to be called\r\neminent?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, What dost thou mean by eminence?\r\n\r\nTzu-chang answered, To be famous in the state and famous in his home.\r\n\r\nThat is fame, not eminence, said the Master. The eminent man is plain\r\nand straight, and loves right. He weighs words and scans looks; he\r\ntakes pains to come down to men. And he shall be eminent in the state\r\nand eminent in his house. The famous man wears a mask of love, but his\r\ndeeds belie it. Self-confident and free from doubts, fame will be his\r\nin the state and fame be his in his home.\r\n\r\n21. Whilst walking with the Master in the Rain God's glade Fan Ch'ih\r\nsaid to him, May I ask how to raise the mind, amend evil and scatter\r\nerrors?\r\n\r\nWell asked! said the Master. Rank thy work above success, will not\r\nthe mind be raised? Fight the bad in thee, not the bad in other men,\r\nwill not evil be mended? One angry morning to forget both self and\r\nkin, is that no error?\r\n\r\n22. Fan Ch'ih asked, What is love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To love men.\r\n\r\nHe asked, What is wisdom?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To know men.\r\n\r\nFan Ch'ih did not understand.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Lift up the straight, put by the crooked, and crooked\r\nmen will grow straight.\r\n\r\nFan Ch'ih withdrew, and seeing Tzu-hsia, said to him, The Master saw\r\nme and I asked him what wisdom is. He answered, Lift up the straight,\r\nput by the crooked, and crooked men will grow straight. What did he\r\nmean?\r\n\r\nHow rich a saying! said Tzu-hsia. When Shun[122] had all below heaven\r\nhe chose Kao-yao from the many, lifted him up, and the men without\r\nlove fled. When T'ang[123] had all below heaven, he chose Yi-yin[124]\r\nfrom the many, lifted him up, and the men without love fled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: An emperor of the golden age.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: The founder of the Shang, or Yin, dynasty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: T'ang's chief minister. Yi-yin said, Whomsoever I\r\nserve, is he not my lord? Whomsoever I rule, are they not my people?\r\nHe came in when there was order, and came in too when there were\r\ntumults. He said, When Heaven begat the people, the man that first\r\nunderstood was sent to waken those slow to understand, and the man\r\nthat first woke was sent to waken those slow to wake. I am he that\r\nwoke first among Heaven's people. With the help of the Way, I shall\r\nwake the people! For man or wife, of all the people below heaven, to\r\nhave missed the blessings of Yao and Shun was the same, he thought, as\r\nif he himself had pushed him into the ditch. The burden he shouldered\r\nwas the weight of all below heaven. (Mencius, Book X, chapter 1.)]\r\n\r\n23. Tzu-kung asked about friends.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Talk faithfully to them, and guide them well. If this\r\nis no good, stop. Do not bring shame upon thee.\r\n\r\n24. Tseng-tzu said, A gentleman gathers friends by culture, and stays\r\nlove with friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Tzu-lu asked how to rule.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Go before; work hard.\r\n\r\nWhen asked to say more, he said, Never flag.\r\n\r\n2. When he was steward of the Chi, Chung-kung asked how to rule.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Let officers act first; overlook small faults, lift\r\nup brains and worth.\r\n\r\nChung-kung said, How shall I get to know brains and worth to lift them\r\nup?\r\n\r\nLift up those thou dost know, said the Master; and those thou dost not\r\nknow, will other men pass by?\r\n\r\n3. Tzu-lu said, The lord of Wei[125] waits for you, Sir, to govern.\r\nHow shall ye begin?\r\n\r\nSurely, said the Master, by putting names right.\r\n\r\nIndeed, said Tzu-lu, that is far-fetched, Sir. Why put them right?\r\n\r\nWhat a savage Yu[126] is! said the Master. A gentleman is tongue-tied\r\nwhen he does not understand. If names are not right, words do not fit.\r\nIf words do not fit, affairs go wrong. If affairs go wrong, neither\r\ncourtesy nor music thrive. If courtesy and music do not thrive, law\r\nand justice fail. And if law and justice fail them, the people can\r\nmove neither hand nor foot. So a gentleman must be ready to put names\r\ninto speech and words into deed. A gentleman is nowise careless of his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: See note to Book VII, § 14. Tzu-lu was his officer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n4. Fan Ch'ih asked to be taught husbandry.\r\n\r\nThe Master said. An old husbandman knows more than I do.\r\n\r\nHe asked to be taught gardening.\r\n\r\nThe Master said. An old gardener knows more than I do.\r\n\r\nAfter Fan Ch'ih had gone, the Master said, How small a man! If those\r\nabove love courtesy, no one will dare to slight them; if they love\r\nright, no one will dare to disobey; if they love truth, no one will\r\ndare to hide the heart. Then, from the four corners of the earth, folk\r\nwill gather with their children on their backs; and what need will\r\nthere be for husbandry?\r\n\r\n5. The Master said, Though a man have conned three hundred poems, if\r\nhe stands helpless when put to govern, if he cannot answer for himself\r\nwhen he is sent to the four corners of the earth, many as they are,\r\nwhat have they done for him?\r\n\r\n6. The Master said, The man of upright life is obeyed before he\r\nspeaks; commands even go unheeded when the life is crooked.\r\n\r\n7. The Master said, The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\r\n\r\n8. Speaking of Ching, of the ducal house of Wei, the Master said, He\r\nwas wise in his private life. When he had begun to save, he said, This\r\nseems enough. When he grew better off, he said, This seems plenty.\r\nWhen he had grown rich, he said. This seems splendour.\r\n\r\n9. When Jan Yu was driving him to Wei, the Master said. What numbers!\r\n\r\nJan Yu said, Since numbers are here, what next is needed?\r\n\r\nWealth, said the Master.\r\n\r\nAnd what comes next after wealth?\r\n\r\nTeaching, said the Master.\r\n\r\n10. The Master said, If I were employed for a twelve-month, much could\r\nbe done. In three years all would be ended.\r\n\r\n11. The Master said, If good men were to govern a land for an hundred\r\nyears, cruelty would be conquered and putting to death done away with.\r\nHow true are these words!\r\n\r\n12. The Master said, Even if a king were to govern, a lifetime would\r\npass before love dawned!\r\n\r\n13. The Master said, What is governing to a man that can rule himself?\r\nIf he cannot rule himself, how shall he rule others?\r\n\r\n14. As the disciple Jan[127] came back from court, the Master said to\r\nhim. Why so late?\r\n\r\nI had business of state, he answered.\r\n\r\nHousehold business, said the Master. If it had been business of state,\r\nthough I am out of office, I should have heard of it.\r\n\r\n15. Duke Ting asked, Is there any one saying that can bless a kingdom?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Jan Yu. He was in the service of the Chi, not of the\r\nDuke of Lu.]\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, That is more than words can do. But men have a\r\nsaying, To be lord is hard and to be minister is not easy. And if one\r\nknew how hard it is to be lord, might not this one saying almost bless\r\na kingdom?\r\n\r\nAnd is there any one saying that can wreck a kingdom?\r\n\r\nThat is more than words can do, Confucius answered. But men have a\r\nsaying, My only delight in being lord is that no one withstands what I\r\nsay. Now if what he says is good, and no one withstands him, is not\r\nthat good too? But if it is not good, and no one withstands him, might\r\nnot this one saying almost wreck a kingdom?\r\n\r\n16. The Duke of She asked, What is kingcraft?\r\n\r\nThe Master answered, For those near us to be happy and those far off\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n17. When he was governor of Chü-fu, Tzu-hsia asked how to rule.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Be not eager for haste; look not for small gains.\r\nNothing done in haste is thorough, and looking for small gains big\r\nthings are left undone.\r\n\r\n18. The Duke of She told Confucius, Among the upright men of my clan\r\nif the father steals a sheep his son bears witness.\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, Our clan's uprightness is unlike that. The father\r\nscreens his son and the son screens his father. There is uprightness\r\nin this.\r\n\r\n19. Fan Ch'ih asked, What is love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To be humble at home, earnest at work, and faithful\r\nto all. Even among wild tribes none of this must be dropped.\r\n\r\n20. Tzu-kung asked, What is it that we call knighthood?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To be called a knight, a man must be shamefast in all\r\nthat he does, if he is sent to the four corners of the earth he must\r\nnot disgrace his lord's commands.\r\n\r\nMay I ask who would come next?\r\n\r\nHe that his clansmen call a good son and his neighbours call modest.\r\n\r\nAnd who would come next?\r\n\r\nA man that clings to his word and sticks to his course, a flinty\r\nlittle fellow, would perhaps come next.\r\n\r\nAnd how are the crown servants of to-day?\r\n\r\nWhat! The weights and measures men! said the Master. Are they worth\r\nreckoning?\r\n\r\n21. The Master said, As I cannot get men of the middle way I have to\r\nfall back on zealous and austere men. Zealous men push ahead and take\r\nthings up, and there are things that austere men will not do.\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, 'Unless he is\r\nstable a man will make neither a wizard nor a leech.' This is true.\r\n'His instability of mind may disgrace him.'\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Neglect of the omens, that is all.\r\n\r\n23. The Master said, Gentlemen unite, but are not the same. Small men\r\nare all the same, but each for himself.\r\n\r\n24. Tzu-kung said, If the whole countryside loved a man, how would\r\nthat be?\r\n\r\nIt would not do, said the Master.\r\n\r\nAnd how would it be, if the whole countryside hated him?\r\n\r\nIt would not do, said the Master. It would be better if all the good\r\nmen of the countryside loved him and all the bad men hated him.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said, A gentleman is easy to serve and hard to please.\r\nIf we go from the Way to please him, he is not pleased; but his\r\ncommands are measured to the man. A small man is hard to serve and\r\neasy to please. Though we go from the Way to please him, he is\r\npleased; but he expects everything of his men.\r\n\r\n26. The Master said, A gentleman is high-minded, not proud; the small\r\nman is proud, but not high-minded.\r\n\r\n27. The Master said, Strength and courage, simplicity and modesty are\r\nakin to love.\r\n\r\n28. Tzu-lu asked, When can a man be called a knight?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To be earnest, encouraging and kind may be called\r\nknighthood: earnest and encouraging with his friends, and kind to his\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\n29. The Master said, If a good man taught the people for seven years,\r\nthey would be fit to bear arms too.\r\n\r\n30. The Master said, To take untaught men to war is called throwing\r\nthem away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Hsien[128] asked, What is shame?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To draw pay when the land keeps the Way and to draw\r\npay when it has lost the Way, is shame.\r\n\r\n2. To eschew strife and bragging, spite and greed, would that be love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, That may be hard to do; but I do not know that it is\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, A knight that is fond of ease does not amount to a\r\nknight.\r\n\r\n4. The Master said, Whilst the land keeps the Way, be fearless of\r\nspeech and fearless in deed; when the land has lost the Way, be\r\nfearless in deed but soft of speech.\r\n\r\n5. The Master said, A man of mind can always talk, but talkers are not\r\nalways men of mind. Love is always bold, though boldness is found\r\nwithout love.\r\n\r\n6. Nan-kung Kuo said to Confucius, Yi[129] shot well, Ao pushed a boat\r\nover land: each died before his time. Yü and Chi toiled at their\r\ncrops, and had all below heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Master did not answer. But when Nan-kung Kuo had gone, he said,\r\nWhat a gentleman he is! How he honours mind!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: The disciple Yüan Ssu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Yi was killed by his best pupil, who said to himself,\r\nIn all the world no one but Yi shoots better than I do. So he killed\r\nhim.]\r\n\r\n7. The Master said, Alas! there have been gentlemen without love! But\r\nthere has never been a small man that was not wanting in love.\r\n\r\n8. The Master said, Can he love thee that never tasks thee? Can he be\r\nfaithful that never chides?\r\n\r\n9. The Master said, The decrees were drafted by P'i Shen, criticised\r\nby Shih-shu, polished by the Foreign Minister Tzu-yü, and given the\r\nfinal touches by Tzu-ch'an of Tung-li.\r\n\r\n10. When he was asked what he thought of Tzu-ch'an, the Master said, A\r\nkind-hearted man.\r\n\r\nAsked what he thought of Tzu-hsi, the Master said, Of him! What I\r\nthink of him!\r\n\r\nAsked what he thought of Kuan Chung,[130] the Master said, He was the\r\nman that drove the Po from the town of Pien with its three hundred\r\nhouseholds to end his days on coarse rice, without his muttering a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: See note to Book III, § 22.]\r\n\r\n11. The Master said, Not to grumble at being poor is hard, not to be\r\nproud of wealth is easy.\r\n\r\n12. The Master said, Meng Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be steward of\r\nChao or Wei, but he could not be minister of T'eng or Hsieh.\r\n\r\n13. Tzu-lu asked what would make a full-grown man.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, The wisdom of Tsang Wu-chung, Kung-ch'o's lack of\r\ngreed, Chuang of Pien's boldness and the skill of Jan Ch'iu, graced by\r\ncourtesy and music, might make a full-grown man.\r\n\r\nBut now, he said, who asks the like of a full-grown man? He that in\r\nsight of gain thinks of right, who when danger looms stakes his life,\r\nwho, though the bond be old, does not forget what he has been saying\r\nall his life, might make a full-grown man.\r\n\r\n14. Speaking of Kung-shu Wen, the Master said to Kung-ming Chia, Is it\r\ntrue that thy master does not speak, nor laugh, nor take a gift?\r\n\r\nKung-ming Chia answered, That is saying too much. My master only\r\nspeaks when the time comes, so no one tires of his speaking; he only\r\nlaughs when he is merry, so no one tires of his laughter; he only\r\ntakes when it is right to take, so no one tires of his taking.\r\n\r\nIt may be so, said the Master; but is it?\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, When he held Fang and asked Lu to appoint an\r\nheir, though Tsang Wu-chung said he was not forcing his lord, I do not\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, Duke Wen of Chin was deep, but dishonest; Duke\r\nHuan of Ch'i was honest, but shallow.\r\n\r\n17. Tzu-lu said, When Duke Huan slew the young duke Chiu, and Shao Hu\r\ndied with him, but Kuan Chung did not, was not this want of love?[131]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Chiu and Huan were brothers, sons of the Duke of Ch'i.\r\nWhen their father died, their uncle seized the throne. To preserve the\r\nrightful heir, Shao Hu and Kuan Chung fled with Chiu to Lu, whilst\r\nHuan escaped to another state. Later on the usurper was murdered, and\r\nHuan returned to Ch'i and secured the throne. He then required the\r\nDuke of Lu to kill his brother and deliver up to him Shao Hu and Kuan\r\nChung. This was done. But on the way to Ch'i Shao Hu killed himself.\r\nKuan Chung, on the other hand, took service under Duke Huan, became\r\nhis chief minister, and raised the state to greatness. (See note to\r\nBook III, § 22.)]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Duke Huan gathered the great vassals round him, not\r\nby chariots of war, but through the might of Kuan Chung. What can love\r\ndo more? What can love do more?\r\n\r\n18. Tzu-kung said, When Duke Huan slew the young duke Chiu, and Kuan\r\nChung could not face death and even became his minister, surely he\r\nshowed want of love?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, By Kuan Chung helping Duke Huan to put down the great\r\nvassals and make all below heaven one, men have fared the better from\r\nthat day to this. But for Kuan Chung our hair would hang down our\r\nbacks and our coats would button to the left; or should he, like the\r\nbumpkin and his lass, their troth to keep, have drowned in a ditch,\r\nunknown to anyone?\r\n\r\n19. The minister Hsien, who had been steward to Kung-shu Wen, went to\r\naudience of the Duke together with Wen.\r\n\r\nWhen the Master heard of it, he said, He is rightly called Wen\r\n(well-bred).\r\n\r\n20. The Master spake of Ling Duke of Wei's contempt for the Way.\r\n\r\nK'ang[132] said, If this be so, how does he escape ruin?\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, With Chung-shu Yü in charge of the guests, the\r\nreader T'o in charge of the Ancestral Temple, and Wang-sun Chia in\r\ncharge of the troops, how should he come to ruin?\r\n\r\n21. The Master said, When words are unblushing, they are hard to make\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Chi K'ang.]\r\n\r\n22. Ch'en Ch'eng murdered Duke Chien.[133]\r\n\r\nConfucius bathed, and went to court and told Duke Ai, saying, Ch'en\r\nHeng has murdered his lord: pray, punish him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke said, Tell the three chiefs.\r\n\r\nConfucius said, As I follow in the wake of the ministers, I dared not\r\nleave this untold; but the lord says, Tell the three chiefs.\r\n\r\nHe told the three chiefs. It did no good.\r\n\r\nConfucius said, As I follow in the wake of the ministers, I dared not\r\nleave this untold.\r\n\r\n23. Tzu-lu asked how to serve a lord.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Never cheat him; stand up to him.\r\n\r\n24. The Master said, A gentleman's life leads upwards; the small man's\r\nlife leads down.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said, The men of old learned for their own sake; to-day\r\nmen learn for show.\r\n\r\n26. Ch'ü Po-yü sent a man to Confucius.\r\n\r\nAs they sat together, Confucius asked him, What does your master do?\r\n\r\nHe answered, My master wishes to make his faults fewer, but cannot.\r\n\r\nWhen the messenger had left, the Master said, A messenger, a messenger\r\nindeed!\r\n\r\n27. The Master said, When not in office discuss not policy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: 481 B.C., two years before the death of Confucius, who\r\nwas not at the time in office. Chien was Duke of Ch'i, a state\r\nbordering on Lu. The three chiefs were the heads of the three great\r\nclans that were all-powerful in Lu.]\r\n\r\n28. Tseng-tzu said, Even in his thoughts, a gentleman does not outstep\r\nhis place.\r\n\r\n29. The Master said, A gentleman is shamefast of speech: his deeds go\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n30. The Master said, In the way of the gentleman there are three\r\nthings that I cannot achieve. Love is never troubled; wisdom has no\r\ndoubts; courage is without fear.\r\n\r\nThat is what ye say, Sir, said Tzu-kung.\r\n\r\n31. Tzu-kung would liken this man to that.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, What talents Tz'u has! Now I have no time for this.\r\n\r\n32. The Master said, Sorrow not at being unknown; sorrow for thine own\r\nshortcomings.\r\n\r\n33. The Master said, Not to expect to be cheated, nor to look for\r\nfalsehood, and yet to see them coming, shows worth in a man.\r\n\r\n34. Wei-sheng Mou said to Confucius, How dost thou still find roosts\r\nto roost on, Ch'iu, unless by wagging a glib tongue?\r\n\r\nConfucius answered, I dare not wag a glib tongue; but I hate\r\nstubbornness.\r\n\r\n35. The Master said, A steed is not praised for his strength, but\r\npraised for his mettle.\r\n\r\n36. One said, To mete out good for evil, how were that?\r\n\r\nAnd how would ye meet good? said the Master. Meet evil with justice;\r\nmeet good with good.\r\n\r\n37. The Master said, Alas! no man knows me! Tzu-kung said, Why do ye\r\nsay, Sir, that no man knows you?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Never murmuring against Heaven, nor finding fault\r\nwith men; learning from the lowest, cleaving the heights. I am known\r\nbut to one, but to Heaven.\r\n\r\n38. Liao, the duke's uncle, spake ill of Tzu-lu to Chi-sun.[134]\r\n\r\nTzu-fu Ching-po told this to Confucius, saying, My master's mind is\r\nsurely being led astray by the duke's uncle, but I have still the\r\nstrength to expose his body in the market-place.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, If the Way is to be kept, that is the Bidding, and if\r\nthe Way is to be lost, this is the Bidding. What can the duke's uncle\r\ndo against the Bidding?\r\n\r\n39. The Master said, Men of worth flee the world; the next best flee\r\nthe land. Then come those that go at a look, then those that go at\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n40. The Master said, Seven men did so.\r\n\r\n41. Tzu-lu spent a night at Shih-men.\r\n\r\nThe gate-keeper asked him, Whence comest thou?\r\n\r\nFrom Confucius, answered Tzu-lu.\r\n\r\nThe man that knows it is no good and yet must still be doing? said the\r\ngate-keeper.\r\n\r\n42. When the Master was chiming his sounding stones in Wei, a\r\nbasket-bearer said, as he passed the door, The heart is full that\r\nchimes those stones! But then he said, For shame! What a tinkling\r\nsound! If no one knows thee, have done!\r\n\r\n    Wade the deep places,\r\n    Lift thy robe through the shallows!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: The head of the Chi clan, in whose service Tzu-lu\r\nwas.]\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Where there's a will, that is nowise hard.\r\n\r\n43. Tzu-chang said, What does the Book mean by saying that\r\nKao-tsung[135] in his mourning shed did not speak for three years?\r\n\r\nWhy pick out Kao-tsung? said the Master. The men of old were all thus.\r\nFor three years after their lord had died, the hundred officers did\r\neach his duty and hearkened to the chief minister.\r\n\r\n44. The Master said, When those above love courtesy, the people are\r\neasy to lead.\r\n\r\n45. Tzu-lu asked, What makes a gentleman?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To be bent on becoming better.\r\n\r\nIs that all? said Tzu-lu.\r\n\r\nBy becoming better to bring peace to men.\r\n\r\nAnd is that all?\r\n\r\nBy becoming better to bring peace to all men, said the Master. Even\r\nYao and Shun were still struggling to become better, and so bring\r\npeace to all men.\r\n\r\n46. Yüan Jang awaited the Master squatting.\r\n\r\nUnruly when young, unmentioned as man, undying when old, spells\r\ngood-for-nothing! said the Master, and he hit him on the leg with his\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n47. When a lad from the village of Ch'üeh was made messenger, someone\r\nasked, saying, Is it because he is doing well?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, I have seen him sitting in a man's seat, and seen him\r\nwalking abreast of his elders. He does not try to do well: he wishes\r\nto be quickly grown up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: An emperor of the Yin dynasty.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XV\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Ling, Duke of Wei, asked Confucius about the line of battle.\r\n\r\nConfucius answered. Of the ritual of dish and platter[136] I have\r\nheard somewhat: I have not learnt warfare.\r\n\r\nHe left the next day.\r\n\r\nIn Ch'en grain ran out. His followers were too ill to rise. Tzu-lu\r\nshowed that he was put out.\r\n\r\nHas a gentleman to face want too? he said.\r\n\r\nGentlemen have indeed to face want, said the Master. The small man,\r\nwhen he is in want, runs to excess.\r\n\r\n2. The Master said, Tz'u,[137] dost thou not take me for a man that\r\nhas learnt much and thought it over?\r\n\r\nYes, he answered: is it not so?\r\n\r\nNo, said the Master. I string all into one.\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, Yu,[138] how few men know great-heartedness!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: For sacrifice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Tzu-kung.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Tzu-lu: probably said to him on the occasion mentioned\r\nin § I.]\r\n\r\n4. The Master said, To rule doing nothing, was what Shun did. For what\r\nis there to do? Self-respect and to set the face to rule, is all.\r\n\r\n5. Tzu-chang asked how to get on.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Be faithful and true of word, plain and lowly in thy\r\nwalk; thou wilt get on even in tribal lands. If thy words be not\r\nfaithful and true, thy walk not plain and lowly, wilt thou get on\r\neven in thine own town? Standing, see these words ranged before thee;\r\ndriving, see them written upon the yoke. Then thou wilt get on.\r\n\r\nTzu-chang wrote them on his girdle.\r\n\r\n6. The Master said, Straight indeed was the historian Yü! Like an\r\narrow whilst the land kept the Way; and like an arrow when it lost the\r\nWay! What a gentleman was Ch'ü Po-yü! Whilst the land kept the Way he\r\ntook office, and when the land had lost the Way he rolled himself up\r\nin thought.\r\n\r\n7. The Master said, Not to speak to him that has ears to hear is to\r\nspill the man. To speak to a man without ears to hear is to spill thy\r\nwords. Wisdom spills neither man nor words.\r\n\r\n8. The Master said, A high will, or a loving heart, will not seek life\r\nat cost of love. To fulfil love they will kill the body.\r\n\r\n9. Tzu-kung asked how to attain to love.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, A workman bent on good work must first sharpen his\r\ntools. In the land that is thy home, serve those that are worthy among\r\nthe great and make friends with loving knights.\r\n\r\n10. Yen Yüan asked how to rule a kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Follow the Hsia seasons, drive in the chariot of Yin,\r\nwear the head-dress of Chou, take for music the Shao and its dance.\r\nBanish the strains of Cheng and flee men that are glib; for the\r\nstrains of Cheng are wanton and glib speakers are dangerous.\r\n\r\n11. The Master said. Without thought for far off things, there shall\r\nbe trouble near at hand.\r\n\r\n12. The Master said, All is ended! I have seen no one that loves mind\r\nas he loves looks!\r\n\r\n13. The Master said, Did not Tsang Wen filch his post? He knew the\r\nworth of Liu-hsia Hui,[139] and did not stand by him.\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, By asking much of self and little of other men\r\nill feeling is banished.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, Unless a man say, Would this do? Would that do? I\r\ncan do nothing for him.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, When all day long there is no talk of right, and\r\nlittle wiles find favour, the company is in hard case.\r\n\r\n17. The Master said, Right is the stuff of which a gentleman is made.\r\nDone with courtesy, spoken with humility, rounded with truth, right\r\nmakes a gentleman.\r\n\r\n18. The Master said, His shortcomings trouble a gentleman; to be\r\nunknown does not trouble him.\r\n\r\n19. The Master said, A gentleman fears that his name shall be no more\r\nheard when life is done.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Another of these _seigneurs du temps jadis_ that is\r\nmore to us than a dim shadow, for he still lives in the pages of\r\nMencius, who tells us that, He was not ashamed of a foul lord, and did\r\nnot refuse a small post. On coming in he did not hide his worth, but\r\nheld his own way. Neglected and idle, he did not grumble; straitened\r\nand poor, he did not mope. When brought together with country folk he\r\nwas quite at his ease and could not bear to leave them. Thou art thou,\r\nhe said, and I am I: standing beside me with thy coat off, or thy body\r\nnaked, how canst thou defile me? (Book X, chapter 1). He stopped if a\r\nhand was raised to stop him, for he did not care whether he went or no\r\n(Book III, chapter 9).]\r\n\r\n20. The Master said, A gentleman asks of himself, the small man asks\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n21. The Master said, A gentleman is firm, not quarrelsome; a friend,\r\nnot a partisan.\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, A gentleman does not raise a man for his words,\r\nnor spurn the speech for the man.\r\n\r\n23. Tzu-kung said, Is there one word by which we may walk till life\r\nends?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Fellow-feeling, perhaps. Do not do unto others what\r\nthou wouldst not have done to thee.\r\n\r\n24. The Master said, Of the men that I meet, whom do I cry down, whom\r\ndo I overpraise? Or, if I overpraise them, it is after testing them.\r\nIt was owing to this people that the three lines of kings went the\r\nstraight way.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said, I have still known historians that would leave a\r\ngap in their text, and men that would lend a horse to another to ride.\r\nNow it is so no more.\r\n\r\n26. The Master said, Cunning words confound the mind; petty impatience\r\nconfounds great projects.\r\n\r\n27. The Master said, The hatred of the many must be looked into; the\r\nlove of the many must be looked into.\r\n\r\n28. The Master said, The man can exalt the Way: it is not the Way that\r\nexalts the man.\r\n\r\n29. The Master said, The fault is to cleave to a fault.\r\n\r\n30. The Master said, I have spent whole days without food and whole\r\nnights without sleep, thinking, and gained nothing by it. Learning is\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n31. The Master said, A gentleman thinks of the Way; he does not think\r\nof food. Sow, and famine may follow; learn, and pay may come; but a\r\ngentleman grieves for the Way; to be poor does not grieve him.\r\n\r\n32. The Master said, What wisdom has got will be lost again, unless\r\nlove hold it fast. Wisdom to get and love to hold fast, without\r\ndignity of bearing, will not be honoured among men. Wisdom to get,\r\nlove to hold fast and dignity of bearing, without courteous ways are\r\nnot enough.\r\n\r\n33. The Master said, A gentleman has no small knowledge, but he can\r\ncarry out big things: the small man can carry out nothing big, but he\r\nmay be knowing in small things.\r\n\r\n34. The Master said, Love is more to the people than fire and water. I\r\nhave seen men come to their death by fire and water: I have seen no\r\nman that love brought to his death.\r\n\r\n35. The Master said, When love is at stake yield not to an army.\r\n\r\n36. The Master said, A gentleman is consistent, not changeless.\r\n\r\n37. The Master said, A servant of the king honours his work, and puts\r\nfood after it.\r\n\r\n38. The Master said, Learning knows no rank.\r\n\r\n39. The Master said, Mingle not in projects with a man whose way is\r\nnot thine.\r\n\r\n40. The Master said, The whole end of speech is to be understood.\r\n\r\n41. When he saw the music-master Mien, the Master said, as they came\r\nto the steps, Here are the steps. On coming to the mat, he said, Here\r\nis the mat. When all were seated, the Master told him, He and he are\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAfter the music-master had gone, Tzu-chang said, Is this the way to\r\nspeak to a music-master?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Surely it is the way to help a music-master.[140]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: The man being blind, as so many musicians are in the\r\nEast.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Chi was about to make war on Chuan-yü.[141]\r\n\r\nWhen Confucius saw Jan Yu and Chi-lu,[142] they said to him, The Chi\r\nis going to deal with Chuan-yü.\r\n\r\nConfucius said, After all, Ch'iu,[143] art thou not in the wrong? The\r\nkings of old made Chuan-yü lord of Tung Meng.[144] Moreover, as\r\nChuan-yü is inside our borders it is the liege of the spirits of earth\r\nand corn of our land; so how can ye make war upon it?\r\n\r\nJan Yu said, Our master wishes it. Tzu-lu and I, his two ministers, do\r\nnot, either of us, wish it.\r\n\r\nConfucius said, Ch'iu, Chou Jen used to say, 'He that can put forth\r\nhis strength takes his place in the line; he that cannot stands back.'\r\nWho would take to help him a man that is no stay in danger and no\r\nsupport in falling? Moreover, what thou sayest is wrong. If a tiger or\r\na buffalo escapes from his pen, if tortoiseshell or jade is broken in\r\nits case, who is to blame?\r\n\r\nJan Yu said, But Chuan-yü is now strong, and it is near to Pi[145]; if\r\nit is not taken now, in days to come it will bring sorrow on our sons\r\nand grandsons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: A small feudatory state of Lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Tzu-lu. He and Jan Yu were in the service of the Chi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Jan Yu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: A mountain in Chuan-yü. Since the Emperor had given the\r\nruler of Chuan-yü the right to sacrifice to its mountains, that state\r\nhad some measure of independence, though it was feudatory to Lu, and\r\nwithin its borders.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: A town belonging to the Chi.]\r\n\r\nCh'iu, said Confucius, instead of saying 'I want it,' a gentleman\r\nhates to plead that he needs must. I have heard that fewness of men\r\ndoes not vex a king or a chief, but unlikeness of lot vexes him.\r\nPoverty does not vex him, but want of peace vexes him. For if wealth\r\nwere even, no one would be poor. In harmony is number; peace prevents\r\na fall. Thus, if far off tribes will not submit, bring them in by\r\nencouraging mind and art, and when they come in give them peace. But\r\nnow, when far off tribes will not submit, ye two, helpers of your\r\nlord, cannot bring them in. The kingdom is split and falling, and ye\r\ncannot save it. Yet inside our land ye plot to move spear and shield!\r\nThe sorrows of Chi's grandsons will not rise in Chuan-yü, I fear: they\r\nwill rise within the palace wall.\r\n\r\n2. Confucius said, When the Way is kept below heaven, courtesy, music\r\nand punitive wars flow from the Son of heaven. When the Way is lost\r\nbelow heaven, courtesy, music and punitive wars flow from the great\r\nvassals. When they flow from the great vassals they will rarely last\r\nfor ten generations. When they flow from the great ministers they will\r\nrarely last for five generations. When underlings sway the country's\r\nfate they will rarely last for three generations. When the Way is kept\r\nbelow heaven power does not lie with the great ministers. When the Way\r\nis kept below heaven common folk do not argue.\r\n\r\n3. Confucius said, For five generations its income has passed from the\r\nducal house;[146] for four generations power has lain with the great\r\nministers: and humbled, therefore, are the sons and grandsons of the\r\nthree Huan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Of Lu.]\r\n\r\n4. Confucius said, There are three friends that help us, and three\r\nthat do us harm. The friends that help us are a straight friend, an\r\noutspoken friend, and a friend that has heard much. The friends that\r\nharm us are plausible friends, friends that like to flatter, and\r\nfriends with a glib tongue.\r\n\r\n5. Confucius said, There are three delights that do good, and three\r\nthat do us harm. Those that do good are delight in dissecting good\r\nform and music, delight in speaking of the good in men, and delight in\r\nhaving many worthy friends. Those that do harm are proud delights,\r\ndelight in idle roving, and delight in the joys of the feast.\r\n\r\n6. Confucius said. Men that wait upon lords fall into three mistakes.\r\nTo speak before the time has come is rashness. Not to speak when the\r\ntime has come is secrecy. To speak heedless of looks is blindness.\r\n\r\n7. Confucius said, A gentleman has three things to guard against.\r\n\r\nIn the days of thy youth, ere thy strength is steady, beware of lust.\r\nWhen manhood is reached, in the fulness of strength, beware of strife.\r\nIn old age, when thy strength is broken, beware of greed.\r\n\r\n8. Confucius said, A gentleman holds three things in awe. He is in\r\nawe of the Bidding of Heaven; he is in awe of great men; and he is\r\nawed by the words of the holy.\r\n\r\nThe small man knows not the Bidding of Heaven, and holds it not in\r\nawe. He is saucy towards the great; he makes game of holy men's words.\r\n\r\n9. Confucius said, The best men are born wise. Next come those that\r\ngrow wise by learning; then those that learn from toil. Those that do\r\nnot learn from toil are the lowest of the people.\r\n\r\n10. Confucius said, A gentleman has nine aims. To see clearly; to\r\nunderstand what he hears; to be warm in manner, dignified in bearing,\r\nfaithful of speech, keen at work; to ask when in doubt; in anger to\r\nthink of difficulties; and in sight of gain to think of right.\r\n\r\n11. Confucius said, In sight of good to be filled with longing; to\r\nlook on evil as scalding to the touch: I have seen such men, I have\r\nheard such words.\r\n\r\nTo live apart and search thy will; to achieve thy Way, by doing right:\r\nI have heard these words, but I have seen no such men.\r\n\r\n12. Ching, Duke of Ch'i, had a thousand teams of horses; but the\r\npeople, on his death day, found no good in him to praise. Po-yi[147]\r\nand Shu-ch'i[148] starved at the foot of Shou-yang, and to this day\r\nthe people still praise them.\r\n\r\nIs not this the clue to that?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: See note to Book V, § 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: See note to Book V, § 22.]\r\n\r\n13. Ch'en K'ang[149] asked Po-yü,[150] Apart from us, have ye heard\r\nanything, Sir?\r\n\r\nHe answered, No: once as my father stood alone and I sped across the\r\nhall, he said to me, Art thou learning poetry? I answered, No. He that\r\ndoes not learn poetry, he said, has no hold on words. I withdrew and\r\nlearned poetry.\r\n\r\nAnother day, when he again stood alone and I sped across the hall, he\r\nsaid to me, Art thou learning courtesy? I answered, No. He that does\r\nnot learn courtesy, he said, has no foothold. I withdrew and learned\r\ncourtesy. These two things I have heard.\r\n\r\nCh'en K'ang withdrew, and cried gladly, I asked one thing, and I get\r\nthree! I hear of poetry; I hear of courtesy; and I hear too that a\r\ngentleman stands aloof from his son.\r\n\r\n14. A king speaks of his wife as 'my wife.' She calls herself\r\n'handmaid.' Her subjects speak of her as 'our lord's wife,' but when\r\nthey speak to foreigners, they say 'our little queen.' Foreigners\r\nspeak of her, too, as 'the lord's wife.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: The disciple Tzu-ch'in.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: The son of Confucius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Yang Huo[151] wished to see Confucius. Confucius did not go to see\r\nhim. He sent Confucius a sucking pig. Confucius chose a time when he\r\nwas out, and went to thank him. They met on the road.\r\n\r\nHe said to Confucius, Come, let us speak together. To cherish a gem,\r\nand undo the kingdom, can that be called love?\r\n\r\nIt cannot, said Confucius.\r\n\r\nTo love office, and miss the hour again and again, can that be called\r\nwisdom?\r\n\r\nIt cannot, said Confucius.\r\n\r\nThe days and months go by; the years do not wait for us.\r\n\r\nTrue, said Confucius; I must take office.\r\n\r\n2. The Master said, Men are near to each other by nature; the lives\r\nthey lead sunder them.\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, Only the wisest and stupidest of men never change.\r\n\r\n4. As the Master came to Wu-ch'eng[152] he heard sounds of lute and\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nWhy use an ox-knife to kill a fowl? said the Master, with a pleased\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nTzu-yu answered, Master, once I heard you say, A gentleman that has\r\nlearnt the Way loves men; small folk that have learnt the Way are easy\r\nto rule.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: The all-powerful, unscrupulous minister of the Chi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: A very small town, of which the disciple Tzu-yu was\r\ngovernor.]\r\n\r\nMy two-three boys, said the Master, what Yen[153] says is true. I\r\nspake before in play.\r\n\r\n5. Kung-shan Fu-jao[154] held Pi in rebellion. He called the Master,\r\nwho wished to go.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu said in displeasure. This cannot be! why must ye go to\r\nKung-shan?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, He calls me, and would that be all? Could I not make\r\nan Eastern Chou[155] of him that uses me?\r\n\r\n6. Tzu-chang asked Confucius what is love.\r\n\r\nConfucius said, Love is to mete out five things to all below heaven.\r\n\r\nMay I ask what they are?\r\n\r\nModesty and bounty, said Confucius, truth, earnestness and kindness.\r\nModesty escapes insult: bounty wins the many; truth gains men's trust;\r\nearnestness brings success; and kindness is enough to make men work.\r\n\r\n7. Pi Hsi called the Master, who wished to go.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu said, Master, I heard you say once, To men whose own life is\r\nevil, no gentleman will go. Pi Hsi holds Chung-mou in rebellion; how\r\ncould ye go to him, Sir?\r\n\r\nYes, I said so, answered the Master. But is not a thing called hard\r\nthat cannot be ground thin; white, if steeping will not turn it black?\r\nAnd am I a gourd? Can I hang without eating?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: Tzu-yu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: Steward of the Chi, and a confederate of Yang Huo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: A kingdom in the east to match Chou in the west, the\r\nhome of Kings Wen and Wu.]\r\n\r\n8. The Master said, Hast thou heard the six words, Yu,[156] and the\r\nsix they sink into?\r\n\r\nHe answered. No.\r\n\r\nSit down, and I shall tell thee. The thirst for love, without love of\r\nlearning, sinks into simpleness. Love of knowledge, without love of\r\nlearning, sinks into vanity. Love of truth, without love of learning,\r\nsinks into cruelty. Love of straightness, without love of learning,\r\nsinks into rudeness. Love of daring, without love of learning, sinks\r\ninto turbulence. Love of strength, without love of learning, sinks\r\ninto oddity.\r\n\r\n9. The Master said, My little children, why do ye not learn poetry?\r\nPoetry would ripen you; teach you insight, friendliness and\r\nforbearance; show you how to serve your father at home; and teach your\r\nlord abroad; and it would teach you the names of many birds and\r\nbeasts, plants and trees.\r\n\r\n10. The Master said to Po-yü,[157] Hast thou done the Chou-nan and\r\nShao-nan?[158] He that has not done the Chou-nan and Shao-nan is like\r\na man standing with his face to the wall.\r\n\r\n11. The Master said, 'Courtesy, courtesy,' is the cry; but are jade\r\nand silk the whole of courtesy? 'Music, music,' is the cry; but are\r\nbells and drums the whole of music?\r\n\r\n12. The Master said, Fierce looks and weakness within are like the\r\nsmall man, like the thief that breaks through or clambers over a wall.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: Tzu-lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: His son.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: The first two books of _The Book of Poetry_.]\r\n\r\n13. The Master said, The plain townsman is the bane of mind.\r\n\r\n14. The Master said, To tell unto the dust all that we hear upon the\r\nway is to lay waste the mind.\r\n\r\n15. The Master said, How can we serve the king with a low fellow, who\r\nis itching to get what he wants and trembling to lose what he has?\r\nThis trembling to lose what he has may lead him anywhere.\r\n\r\n16. The Master said, Men of old had three failings, which have,\r\nperhaps, died out to-day. Ambitious men of old were not nice; now they\r\nare unprincipled. Stern men of old were hard; now they are\r\nquarrelsome. Ignorant men of old were straight; now they are false.\r\nThat is all.\r\n\r\n17. The Master said, Smooth words and fawning looks are seldom found\r\nwith love.\r\n\r\n18. The Master said, I hate the ousting of scarlet by purple. I hate\r\nthe strains of Cheng, confounders of sweet music. I hate a sharp\r\ntongue, the ruin of kingdom and home.\r\n\r\n19. The Master said, I wish no word were spoken!\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, Sir, if ye said no word, what could your little\r\nchildren write?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, What are the words of Heaven? The four seasons pass,\r\nthe hundred things bear life. What are the words of Heaven?\r\n\r\n20. Ju Pei wished to see Confucius. Confucius pleaded sickness; but,\r\nas the messenger left his door, he took a lute and sang, so the\r\nmessenger should hear.\r\n\r\n21. Tsai Wo[159] asked about mourning for three years. He thought that\r\none was enough.\r\n\r\nIf for three years gentlemen forsake courtesy, courtesy must suffer.\r\nIf for three years they forsake music, music must decay. The old grain\r\npasses, the new grain sprouts, the round of woods for the fire-drill\r\nis ended in one year.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Feeding on rice, clad in brocade, couldst thou be at\r\nrest?\r\n\r\nI could, he answered.\r\n\r\nThen do what gives thee rest. But a gentleman, when he is mourning,\r\nhas no taste for sweets and no ear for music; he cannot rest in his\r\nhome. So he gives these up. Now, they give thee rest; then keep them.\r\n\r\nAfter Tsai Wo had gone, the Master said, Yü's[160] want of love! At\r\nthe age of three a child first leaves the arms of his father and\r\nmother, and mourning lasts for three years everywhere below heaven.\r\nBut did Yü have for three years the love of his father and mother?\r\n\r\n22. The Master said, It is hard indeed when a man eats his fill all\r\nday, and has nothing to task the mind! Could he not play at chequers?\r\nEven that were better.\r\n\r\n23. Tzu-lu said, Do gentlemen honour daring?\r\n\r\nThey put right higher, said the Master. With daring and no sense of\r\nright gentlemen turn rebels and small men turn robbers.\r\n\r\n24. Tzu-kung said, Do gentlemen hate too?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: A disciple.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Tsai Wo.]\r\n\r\nThey do, said the Master. They hate the sounding of evil deeds; they\r\nhate men of low estate that slander those over them; they hate daring\r\nwithout courtesy; they hate men that are stout and fearless, but\r\nblind.\r\n\r\nAnd Tz'u,[161] he said, dost thou hate too?\r\n\r\nI hate those that take spying for wisdom, who take want of manners for\r\ncourage, and take tale-telling for honesty.\r\n\r\n25. The Master said, Only maids and serving-lads are hard to train. If\r\nwe draw near to them, they get unruly; if we hold them off, they grow\r\nspiteful.\r\n\r\n26. The Master said, When a man of forty is hated, he will be so to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: Tzu-kung.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The lord of Wei[162] left, the lord of Chi[163] was made a slave,\r\nPi-kan[164] spake out, and died.\r\n\r\nConfucius said, Three of the Yin had love.\r\n\r\n2. Whilst Liu-hsia Hui[165] was Chief Knight[166] he was dismissed\r\nthrice.\r\n\r\nMen said. Is it not yet time to leave. Sir?\r\n\r\nHe answered, If I serve men the straight way, where can I go without\r\nbeing dismissed thrice? If I am to serve men the crooked way, why\r\nshould I leave the land of my father and mother?\r\n\r\n3. Speaking of how to treat Confucius, Ching, Duke of Ch'i, said, I\r\ncannot treat him as I do the Chi. I put him between Chi and Meng.\r\n\r\nI am old, he said; I cannot use him.\r\n\r\nConfucius left.\r\n\r\n4. The men of Ch'i[167] sent a gift of music girls. Chi Huan accepted\r\nthem, and for three days no court was held.\r\n\r\nConfucius left.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: Kinsmen of the tyrant Chou Hsin, who brought the house\r\nof Yin to an end.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: Kinsmen of the tyrant Chou Hsin, who brought the house\r\nof Yin to an end.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: Kinsmen of the tyrant Chou Hsin, who brought the house\r\nof Yin to an end.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: See note to Book XV, § 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: Or Criminal Judge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: To Lu, 497 B.C. The turning-point in Confucius's\r\ncareer. He left office and his native land, and wandered abroad for\r\ntwelve long years.]\r\n\r\n5. Chieh-yü, the mad-head of Ch'u, as he passed Confucius, sang,\r\n\r\n    Phoenix, bright phoenix,\r\n      Thy glory is ended!\r\n    Think of to-morrow;\r\n      The past can't be mended.\r\n    Up and away!\r\n    The Court is today\r\n      With danger attended.\r\n\r\nConfucius alighted, for he wished to speak with him: but he hurried\r\naway, and he could not speak with him.\r\n\r\n6. Ch'ang-chü and Chieh-ni were working in the fields. As Confucius\r\npassed them, he sent Tzu-lu to ask for the ford.\r\n\r\nCh'ang-chü said, Who is that holding the reins?\r\n\r\nHe is K'ung Ch'iu, said Tzu-lu.\r\n\r\nIs he K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?\r\n\r\nYes, said Tzu-lu.\r\n\r\nHe knows the ford, said Ch'ang-chü.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu asked Chieh-ni.\r\n\r\nWho are ye, Sir? he answered.\r\n\r\nI am Chung Yu.\r\n\r\nThe disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?\r\n\r\nYes, he answered.\r\n\r\nAll below heaven is seething and boiling, said Chieh-ni, who can\r\nchange it? How much better would it be to follow a knight that flees\r\nthe world than to follow a knight that flees persons!\r\n\r\nAnd he went on hoeing without stop.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu went and told the Master, whose face fell.\r\n\r\nCan I herd with birds and beasts? he said. Whom but these men can I\r\ntake as fellows? And if the Way were kept by all below heaven, I\r\nshould not need to change them.\r\n\r\n7. Tzu-lu, who was following behind, met an old man carrying a basket\r\non his staff.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu asked him, Have ye seen the Master, Sir?\r\n\r\nThe old man answered, Thy four limbs are idle, thou canst not sort the\r\nfive seeds: who is thy Master?\r\n\r\nAnd he planted his staff, and weeded.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu stood and bowed.\r\n\r\nHe kept Tzu-lu for the night, killed a fowl, made millet, gave them\r\nhim to eat, and presented his two sons.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu left the next day, and told the Master.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, He is in hiding.\r\n\r\nHe sent Tzu-lu back to see him; but when he arrived he had gone.\r\n\r\nTzu-lu said, Not to take office is not right. If the ties of old and\r\nyoung cannot be thrown off, how can he throw off the liege's duty to\r\nhis lord? He wishes to keep his life clean, but he is unsettling the\r\nbonds between men. To discharge that duty a gentleman takes office,\r\nthough he knows beforehand that the Way will not be kept.\r\n\r\n8. Po-yi, Shu-ch'i, Yü-chung, Yi-yi, Chu-chang, Liu-hsia Hui and\r\nShao-lien were men that hid from the world.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, Po-yi[168] and Shu-ch'i[169] did not bend the will or\r\nshame the body.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: See note to Book V, § 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: See note to Book V, § 22.]\r\n\r\nWe must say that Liu-hsia Hui[170] and Shao-lien bent the will and\r\nshamed the body. Their words hit man's duty, their deeds hit our\r\nhopes. This we can say and no more.\r\n\r\nWe may say that Yü-chung and Yi-yi lived hidden, but were free of\r\nspeech. Their lives were clean, their retreat was well weighed.\r\n\r\nBut I am unlike all of them: there is nothing I must, or must not, do.\r\n\r\n9. Chih, the Great Music-master, went to Ch'i; Kan, the conductor at\r\nthe second meal, went to Ch'u; Liao, the conductor at the third meal,\r\nwent to Ts'ai; Chüeh, the conductor at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in.\r\nThe drum master Fang-shu crossed the River; the tambourine master Wu\r\ncrossed the Han; Yang the second bandmaster and Hsiang, who played the\r\nsounding stones, crossed the sea.\r\n\r\n10. The Duke of Chou[171] said to the Duke of Lu,[172] A gentleman\r\ndoes not forsake kinsmen, nor offend his great lieges by not using\r\nthem. He will not cast off an old friend unless he have big cause; he\r\ndoes not ask everything of anyone.\r\n\r\n11. Chou had eight knights: Po-ta and Po-kuo, Chung-tu and Chung-hu,\r\nShu-yeh and Shu-hsia, Chi-sui and Chi-kua.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: See note to Book XV, § 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: See note to Book VII, § 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: His son.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Tzu-chang said, The knight that stakes his life when he sees\r\ndanger, who in sight of gain thinks of right, and whose thoughts are\r\nreverent at worship, and sad when he is in mourning, will do.\r\n\r\n2. Tzu-hsia said, Goodness, clutched too narrowly; a belief in the Way\r\nwhich is not honest; can they be said to be, or said not to be?\r\n\r\n3. The disciples of Tzu-hsia asked Tzu-chang whom we should choose as\r\nour companions.\r\n\r\nTzu-chang said. What does Tzu-hsia say?\r\n\r\nThey answered, Tzu-hsia says, If the men be well for thee, go with\r\nthem; if they be not well, push them off.\r\n\r\nTzu-chang said. This is not the same as what I had heard. A gentleman\r\nhonours worth and bears with the many. He applauds goodness and pities\r\nweakness. If I were a man of great worth, what could I not bear with\r\nin others? If I am without worth, men will push me off: why should I\r\npush other men off?\r\n\r\n4. Tzu-hsia said, Though there must be things worth seeing along small\r\nways, a gentleman does not follow them, for fear of being left at last\r\nin the mire.\r\n\r\n5. Tzu-hsia said, He that each day remembers his failings and each\r\nmonth forgets nothing won may be said to love learning indeed!\r\n\r\n6. Tzu-hsia said, By wide learning and singleness of will, by keen\r\nquestions and home thinking we reach love.\r\n\r\n7. Tzu-hsia said, To master the hundred trades, apprentices work in a\r\nshop; by learning, a gentleman finds his way.\r\n\r\n8. Tzu-hsia said, The small man must always gloss his faults.\r\n\r\n9. Tzu-hsia said, A gentleman changes thrice. Looking up to him he\r\nseems stern; as we draw near, he warms; but his speech, when we hear\r\nit, is sharp.\r\n\r\n10. Tzu-hsia said, Until they trust him, a gentleman lays no burdens\r\non his people. If they do not trust him, they will think it cruel.\r\nUntil they trust him, he does not chide them. Unless they trust him,\r\nit will seem fault-finding.\r\n\r\n11. Tzu-hsia said, If we keep within the bounds of honour, we can step\r\nto and fro through propriety.\r\n\r\n12. Tzu-yu said, The disciples, the little sons of Tzu-hsia, can\r\nsprinkle and sweep, attend and answer, come in and go out; but what\r\ncan come of twigs without roots?\r\n\r\nWhen Tzu-hsia heard this, he said, Yen Yu[173] is wrong. If we teach\r\none thing in the way of a gentleman first, shall we tire before\r\nreaching the next? Thus plants and trees differ in size. Should the\r\nway of a gentleman bewilder him? To learn it, first and last, none but\r\nthe holy are fit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Tzu-yu.]\r\n\r\n13. Tzu-hsia said, A servant of the crown should give his spare\r\nstrength to learning. With his spare strength a scholar should serve\r\nthe crown.\r\n\r\n14. Tzu-yu said, Mourning should stretch to grief, and stop there.\r\n\r\n15. Tzu-yu said, Our friend Chang[174] can do hard things, but love is\r\nnot yet his.\r\n\r\n16. Tseng-tzu said, Chang is so spacious, so lordly, that at his side\r\nit is hard to do what love bids.\r\n\r\n17. Tseng-tzu said, I have heard the Master say, Man never shows what\r\nis in him unless it be in mourning those dear to him.\r\n\r\n18. Tseng-tzu said, I have heard the Master say, In all else we may be\r\nas good a son as Meng Chuang, but in not changing his father's\r\nministers, or his father's rule, he is hard to match.\r\n\r\n19. The Meng[175] made Yang Fu[176] Chief Knight,[177] who spake to\r\nTseng-tzu about it.\r\n\r\nTseng-tzu said, Those above have lost their way, the people have long\r\nbeen astray. When thou dost get at the truth, be moved to pity, not\r\npuffed with joy.\r\n\r\n20. Tzu-kung said, Chou[178] was not so very wicked! Thus a gentleman\r\nhates to live in a hollow, down into which runs all that is foul below\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n21. Tzu-kung said, A gentleman's faults are like the eating of sun or\r\nmoon.[179] All men see them, and when he mends all men look up to him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Tzu-chang.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: The chief of the Meng clan, powerful in Lu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: A disciple of Tseng-tzu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: Or criminal judge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: The tyrant that ended the Yin dynasty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: An eclipse.]\r\n\r\n22. Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tzu-kung, From whom did Chung-ni[180]\r\nlearn?\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, The Way of Wen and Wu[181] has not fallen into ruin. It\r\nlives in men: the big in big men, the small in small men. In none of\r\nthem is the Way of Wen and Wu missing. How should the Master not learn\r\nit? What need had he for a set teacher?\r\n\r\n23. In talk with the great men of the court Shu-sun Wu-shu[182] said,\r\nTzu-kung is worthier than Chung-ni.\r\n\r\nTzu-fu Ching-po told this to Tzu-kung.\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, This is like the palace wall. My wall reaches to the\r\nshoulder: peeping over you see the good home within. The Master's wall\r\nis several fathoms high: no one can see the beauty of the Ancestral\r\nTemple and the wealth of its hundred officers, unless he gets in by\r\nthe gate. And if only a few men find the gate, may not my lord have\r\nspoken the truth?\r\n\r\n24. Shu-sun Wu-shu cried down Chung-ni.\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, It is labour lost. Chung-ni cannot be cried down. The\r\ngreatness of other men is a hummock, over which we can still leap.\r\nChung-ni is the sun or moon, which no one can overleap. Though the man\r\nwere willing to kill himself, how could he hurt the sun or moon? That\r\nhe does not know his own measure would only be seen the better!\r\n\r\n25. Ch'en Tzu-ch'in[183] said to Tzu-kung, Ye humble yourself, Sir. In\r\nwhat is Chung-ni your better?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: Confucius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: See Introduction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Head of the Meng clan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: A disciple of Tzu-kung.]\r\n\r\nTzu-kung said, By one word a gentleman shows wisdom, by one word want\r\nof wisdom. Words must not be lightly spoken. No one can come up to the\r\nMaster, as heaven is not to be climbed by steps. If the Master had\r\npower in a kingdom, or a clan, the saying would come true, 'What he\r\nsets up stands; he shows the way and men go it, he brings peace and\r\nthey come, he stirs them and they are at one. Honoured in life, he is\r\nmourned when dead!' Who can come up to him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XX[184]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Yao said, Hail to thee, Shun! The count that Heaven is telling\r\nfalls on thee. Keep true hold of the centre. If there be stress or\r\nwant within the four seas, the gift of Heaven will pass for ever.\r\n\r\nShun laid the same commands on Yü.\r\n\r\n_T'ang_ said, I, Thy little child Li, dare to offer this black steer,\r\nand dare to proclaim before Thee, Almighty Lord, that I dare not\r\nforgive sin, nor keep down Thy ministers. Search them, O Lord, in\r\nThine heart. If Our life be sinful, visit it not upon the ten thousand\r\nhomesteads. If the ten thousand homesteads sin, the sin is on Our\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nChou bestowed great gifts, and good men grew rich.\r\n\r\n'Loving hearts are better than near kinsmen. All the people blame no\r\none but me.'[185]\r\n\r\nHe saw to weights and measures, revised the laws, and brought back\r\nbroken officers. Order reigned everywhere. He revived ruined kingdoms\r\nand restored fiefs that had fallen in. All hearts below heaven turned\r\nto him. The people's food, burials and worship weighed most with him.\r\nHis bounty gained the many, his truth won the people's trust, his\r\nearnestness brought success, his justice made men glad.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: This chapter shows the principles on which China was\r\ngoverned in old times. Yao and Shun were the legendary founders of the\r\nChinese Empire, Yü, T'ang, and Chou were the first emperors of the\r\nhouses of Hsia, Shang and Chou, which had ruled China up till the time\r\nof Confucius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: Said by King Wu (Chou). The people blamed him for not\r\ndethroning at once the tyrant Chou Hsin.]\r\n\r\n2. Tzu-chang asked Confucius, How should men be governed?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To govern men we must honour five fair things and\r\nspurn four evil things.\r\n\r\nTzu-chang said, What are the five fair things?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, A gentleman is kind, but not wasteful; he burdens,\r\nbut he does not embitter; he is covetous, but not greedy; high-minded,\r\nbut not proud; stern, but not fierce.\r\n\r\nTzu-chang said, What is meant by kindness without waste?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To further what furthers the people, is not that\r\nkindness without waste? If burdens be sorted to strength, who will\r\ngrumble? To covet love and get love, is that greed? Few or many, small\r\nor great, all is one to a gentleman: he dares not slight any man. Is\r\nnot this to be high-minded, but not proud? A gentleman straightens his\r\nrobe and cap, and settles his look. He is severe, and men look up to\r\nhim with awe. Is not this to be stern, but not fierce?\r\n\r\nTzu-chang said, What are the four evil things?\r\n\r\nThe Master said, To leave untaught and then kill is cruelty; not to\r\ngive warning and to expect things to be done is tyranny; to give\r\ncareless orders and be strict when the day comes is robbery; to be\r\nstingy in rewarding men is littleness.\r\n\r\n3. The Master said, He that does not know the Bidding cannot be a\r\ngentleman. Not to know good form is to have no foothold. Not to know\r\nwords is to know nothing of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Index has been reprinted with few changes from the first edition,\r\nwhilst the book itself has been revised.
