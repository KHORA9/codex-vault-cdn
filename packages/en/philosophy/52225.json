ANTHONY\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nGUSTAVE FLAUBERT\r\n\r\nTranslated by Lafcadio Hearn\r\n\r\nIllustrations by Odilon Redon\r\n\r\n(Added especially for this PG e-book.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alice Harriman Company\r\nNew York and Seattle\r\n1910\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at some period between 1875 and 1876 that Lafcadio Hearn--still\r\na \"cub\" reporter on a daily paper in Cincinnati--began his translation\r\nof Flaubert's \"Temptation of St. Anthony.\" The definitive edition of\r\nthe work, over which the author had laboured for thirty years, had\r\nappeared in 1874.\r\n\r\nHearn was, in his early youth, singularly indifferent to the work of\r\nthe Englishmen of the Victorian period. Though he knew the English\r\nmasterpieces of that epoch, their large, unacademic freedom of manner\r\nawakened no echoes in his spirit. His instinctive taste was for the\r\nexquisite in style: for \"that peculiar kneading, heightening, and\r\nrecasting\" which Matthew Arnold thought necessary for perfection.\r\nNeither did the matter, more than the manner of the Victorians appeal\r\nto him. The circumstances of his life had at so many points set him\r\nout of touch with his fellows that the affectionate mockery of\r\nThackeray's pictures of English society were alien to his interest.\r\nThe laughing heartiness of Dickens' studies of the man in the street\r\nhardly touched him. Browning's poignant analyses of souls were too\r\nrudely robust of manner to move him. Before essaying journalism Hearn\r\nhad served for a while as an assistant in the Public Library, and\r\nthere he had found and fallen under the spell, of the great Frenchman\r\nof the Romantic School of the '30's--that period of rich flowering of\r\nthe Gallic genius. Gautier's tales of ancient weirdnesses fired his\r\nimagination. The penetrating subtleties of his verse woke in the boy\r\nthe felicitous emotions which the virtuoso knows in handling cameos\r\nand enamellings by hands which have long been dust. So, also, Hugo's\r\nrevivals of the passions and terrors of the mediæval world stirred the\r\nyoung librarian's eager interest. But most of all his spirit leapt\r\nto meet the tremendous drama of the \"Temptation.\" He comprehended at\r\nonce its large significance, its great import, and in his enthusiastic\r\nrecognition of its value and meaning he set at once about giving it a\r\nlanguage understood of the people of his own tongue.\r\n\r\nTunison tells of the little shy, shabby, half-blind boy--the long\r\ndull day of police reporting done--labouring at his desk into the\r\nsmall hours, with the flickering gas jet whistling overhead, and his\r\nmyopic eyes bent close to the papers which he covered with beautiful,\r\nalmost microscopic characters--escaping thus from the crass, raw world\r\nabout him to delicately and painstakingly turn into English stories\r\nof Cleopatra's cruel, fantastic Egyptian Night's Entertainment.\r\nWithdrawing himself to transliterate tales of pallid beautiful vampires\r\ndraining the veins of ardent boys: of lovely faded ghosts of great\r\nladies descending from shadowy tapestries to coquette with romantic\r\ndreamers; or to find an English voice for the tragedy of the soul of\r\nthe Alexandrian cenobite.\r\n\r\nIt was in such dreams and labours that he found refuge from the\r\nenvironment that was so antipathetic to his tastes, and in his\r\nimmersion in the works of these virtuosos of words, in his passionate\r\nsearch for equivalents of the subtle nuances of their phrases, he\r\ndeveloped his own style. A style full of intricate assonances, of a\r\ntexture close woven and iridescent.\r\n\r\n\"One of Cleopatra's Night's\"--a translation of some of Gautier's tales\r\nof glamour--was issued in 1882, but at \"The Temptation of St. Anthony\"\r\nthe publishers altogether balked. The manuscript could not achieve even\r\nso much as a reading. America had in the '70's just begun to emerge\r\nfrom that state of provincial propriety in which we were accused of\r\nclothing even our piano legs in pantelettes. The very name of the work\r\nwas sufficient to start modest shivers down the spine of all well\r\nregulated purveyors of books. It was largely due to the painters'\r\nconceptions of the nature of the hermit's trials that the story of\r\nSaint Anthony's spiritual struggle aroused instinctive terrors in all\r\ntruly modest natures. The painters--who so dearly love to display their\r\nskill in drawing legs and busts--had been wont to push the poor old\r\nsaint into the obscure of the background, and fill all the foreground\r\nwith ladies of obviously the very lightest character, in garments\r\nstill lighter, if possible. What had reputable American citizens to do\r\nwith such as these jades? More especially such jades as seen through\r\na French imagination! That Flaubert had brushed aside the gross and\r\njejune conceptions of the painters the publishers would not even take\r\nthe pains to learn.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing now to recall the nervous, timid proprieties of those\r\ndays. At the time Hearn failed to see the laughable side of it. He was\r\nthen too young and earnest, too passionate and too melancholy to have a\r\nsense of its humours.\r\n\r\nHe had brought his unfinished manuscript from Cincinnati to New\r\nOrleans, and had continued to work upon it in strange lodgings in\r\ngaunt, old half-ruined Creole houses; at the tables of odd little\r\nFrench cafés, or among the queer dishes in obscure Spanish and Chinese\r\nrestaurants. He had snatched minutes for it amidst the reading and\r\nclipping of exchanges in a newspaper office; had toiled drippingly\r\nover it in the liquifying heats of tropic nights; had arisen from the\r\n\"inexpungable langours\" of yellow fever to complete its last astounding\r\npages.\r\n\r\nI can remember applauding, with ardent youthful sympathy, his tirades\r\nagainst the stultifying influence of blind puritanism upon American\r\nliterature. I recall his scornful mocking at the inconsistency which\r\ncomplacently accepted the vulgar seduction, and the theatrical Brocken\r\nrevels of Faust, while shrinking piously from Flaubert's grim story of\r\nthe soul of man struggling to answer the riddle of the universe. He\r\nhad however an almost equal contempt for the author's countrymen, who\r\nreceived with eager interest and pleasure the deliberate analysis--in\r\n_Madame Bovary_--of a woman's degradation and ruin, while they yawned\r\nover the amazing history of humanity's tremendous spiritual adventures.\r\nHearn's own sensitiveness shrank in pain from the cold insight which\r\nuncovered layer by layer the brutal squalour of a woman's moral\r\ndisintegration. But he was moved and astounded by the revelation, in\r\nSt. Anthony, of the tragedy and pathos of man's long search for some\r\nbody of belief or philosophy by which he could explain to himself\r\nthe strange great phenomena of life and death, and the inscrutable\r\ncruelties of Nature. The young translator was filled with a sort of\r\nastonished despair at his inability to make others see the book as\r\nhe did--not realizing, in his youthful impatience, that the average\r\nmind clings to the concrete, and is puzzled and terrified by outlines\r\nof thought too large for its range of vision; that the commonplace\r\nintelligence cannot \"see the wood for the trees,\" and becomes confused\r\nand over-weighted when confronted with the huge outlines of so great a\r\npicture as that drawn by Flaubert in his masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThere were many points of resemblance between Lafcadio Hearn and the\r\ngrandson of the French veterinary. A resemblance rather in certain\r\nqualities of the spirit than in social conditions and physical\r\nendowments. Flaubert, born in 1821, was the son of a surgeon. His\r\nfather was long connected with the Hôtel Dieu of Rouen, in which the\r\nboy was born, and in which he lived until his eighteenth year, when he\r\nwent to Paris to study law. One of the friends of his early Parisian\r\ndays describes him as \"a young Greek. Tall, supple, and as graceful as\r\nan athlete. He was charming, _mais un peu farouche._ Quite unconscious\r\nof his physical and mental gifts; very careless of the impression he\r\nproduced, and entirely indifferent to formalities. His dress consisted\r\nof a red flannel shirt, trousers of heavy blue cloth, and a scarf of\r\nthe same colour drawn tight about his slender waist. His hat was worn\r\n'any how' and often he abandoned it altogether. When I spoke to him of\r\nfame or influence.... he seemed superbly indifferent. He had no desire\r\nfor glory or gain.... What was lacking in his nature was an interest in\r\n_les choses extérieures, choses utiles._\" ...\r\n\r\nOne who saw him in 1879 found the young Greek athlete--now close upon\r\nsixty, and having in the interval created some of the great classics\r\nof French literature--\"a huge man, a tremendous old man. His long,\r\nstraggling gray hair was brushed back. His red face was that of a\r\nsoldier, or a sheik--divided by drooping white moustaches. A trumpet\r\nwas his voice, and he gesticulated freely ... the colour of his eyes a\r\nbit of faded blue sky.\"\r\n\r\nThe study of the law did not hold Flaubert long. It was one of those\r\n_choses extérieures, choses utiles_ to which he was so profoundly\r\nindifferent. Paris bored him. He longed for Rouen, and for his little\r\nstudent chamber. There he had lain upon his bed whole days at a time;\r\napparently as lazy as a lizard; smoking, dreaming; pondering the large,\r\ninchoate, formless dreams of youth.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 his father died, and in the following year he lost his sister\r\nCaroline, whom he had passionately loved, and for whom he grieved\r\nall his life. He rejoined his mother, and they established themselves\r\nat Croisset, near Rouen, upon a small inherited property. It was an\r\nagreeable house, pleasantly situated in sight of the Seine. Flaubert\r\nnourished with pleasure a local legend that Pascal had once inhabited\r\nthe old Croisset homestead, and that the Abbé Prevost had written\r\n_Manon Lescaut_ within its walls. Near the house--now gone--he built\r\nfor himself a pavilion to serve as a study, and in this he spent the\r\ngreater portion of the following thirty-four years in passionate,\r\nunremitting labour.\r\n\r\nHe made a voyage to Corsica in his youth; one to Brittany, with Maxime\r\ndu Camp, in 1846; and spent some months in Egypt, Palestine, Turkey,\r\nand Greece in 1849. This Oriental experience gave him the most intense\r\npleasure, and was the germ of _Salammbo_, and of the _Temptation of St.\r\nAnthony._ He never repeated it, though he constantly talked of doing\r\nso. He nursed a persistent, but unrealized dream of going as far as\r\nCeylon, whose ancient name, Taprobana, he was never weary of repeating;\r\nutterance of its melifluous syllables becoming a positive _tic_\r\nwith him. Despite these yearnings he remained at home. Despite his\r\nfull-blooded physique he would take no more exercise than his terrace\r\nafforded, or an occasional swim in the Seine. He smoked incessantly,\r\nand for months at a stretch worked fifteen hours out of the twenty-four\r\nat his desk. Three hundred volumes might be annotated for a page of\r\nfacts. He would write twenty pages, and reduce these by exquisite\r\nconcisions, by fastidious rejections to three; would search for hours\r\nfor the one word that perfectly conveyed the colour of his thought, and\r\nwould--as in the case of the _Temptation_--wait fifteen years for a\r\nsense of satisfaction with a manuscript before allowing it to see the\r\nlight. To Maxime du Camp, who urged him to hasten the completion of his\r\nbook in order to take advantage of a favourable opportunity, he wrote\r\nangrily:\r\n\r\n\"Tu me parais avoir à mon endroit un tic ou vice rédhibitoire. Il\r\nne m'embête pas; n'aie aucune crainte; mon parti est pris là-dessus\r\ndepuis long temps. Je te dirai seulement que tous ces mots; _se\r\ndépêcher, c'est le moment, place prise, se poser, ..._ sont pour moi un\r\nvocabulaire vide de sens....\"\r\n\r\nIn one of his letters he says that on occasion he worked violently for\r\neight hours to achieve one page. He endeavoured never to repeat a word\r\nin that page, and tried to force every phrase to respond to a rhythmic\r\nlaw. Guy do Maupassant, his nephew and pupil, says that to ensure this\r\nrhythm Flaubert \"prenait sa feuille de papier, relevait à la hauteur du\r\nregard et, s'appuyant sur un coude, déclaimait, d'une voix mordant et\r\nhaute. Il écoutait la rythme de sa prose, s'arrêtait comme pour saisir\r\nune sonorité fuyant, combinait les tons, éloignait les assonances,\r\ndisposait les virgules avec conscience, commes les haltes d'un long\r\nchemin.\" ...\r\n\r\nFlaubert said himself, \"une phrase est viable quand elle correspond\r\nà toutes les nécessités de respiration. Je sais qu'elle est bonne\r\nlorsqu'elle peut être lu tout haut.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Irving used to say of himself that it was necessary he should\r\nwork harder than other actors because nature had dowered him with\r\nflexibility of neither voice nor feature, and Faguet says that Flaubert\r\nwas forced to this excessive toil and incessant watchfulness because\r\nhe did not write well naturally. Nevertheless Flaubert's work did not\r\nsmell of the lamp. Whatever shape his ideas may have worn at birth\r\nwhen full grown they moved with large classic grace and freedom,\r\nsimple, sincere, and beautiful in form. François Coppée calls him \"the\r\nBeethoven of French prose.\"\r\n\r\nSo conscientious a workman, so laborious and self-sacrificing an artist\r\nhad a natural attraction for Lafcadio Hearn, who even in boyhood began\r\nto feel his vocation as \"a literary monk.\" The whole tendency of his\r\ntastes prepared him to understand the true importance of Flaubert's\r\nmasterpiece, fitted him especially of all living writers to turn that\r\nmasterpiece into its true English equivalent. The two men had much in\r\ncommon. Both were proud and timid. Both had a fundamental indifference\r\nto _choses extérieures, choses utiles._ Both were realists of the soul.\r\nActions interested each but slightly; the emotions from which actions\r\nsprung very much. To both stupidity was even more antipathetic than\r\nwickedness, because each realized that nearly all cruelty and vice have\r\ntheir germ in ignorance and stupidity rather than in innate rascality.\r\nFlaubert declared, with a sort of rage, that \"la bêtise entre dans\r\nmes pores.\" He might too have been speaking for Hearn when he said\r\nthat the grotesque, the strange, and the monstrous had for him an\r\ninexplicable charm. \"It corresponds,\" he says, \"to the intimate needs\r\nof my nature--it does not cause me to laugh, but to dream long dreams.\"\r\nHearn, however, mixed with this triste interest a quality that Flaubert\r\nseemed almost wholly to lack--a great tenderness for all things humble,\r\nfeeble, ugly and helpless. Both from childhood were curious of poignant\r\nsensations, of the sad, the mysterious and the exotic. And for both the\r\ntropics had an irresistible fascination. Flaubert says, in one of his\r\nletters:\r\n\r\n\"I carry with me the melancholy of the barbaric races, with their\r\ninstincts of migration, and their innate distaste of life, which forced\r\nthem to quit their homes in order to escape from themselves. They loved\r\nthe sun, all those barbarians who came to die in Italy; they had a\r\nfrenzied aspiration toward the light, toward the blue skies, toward an\r\nardent existence.... Think that perhaps I will never see China, will\r\nnever be rocked to sleep by the cadenced footsteps of camels ... will\r\nnever see the shine of a tiger's eyes in the forest.... You can treat\r\nall this as little worthy of pity, but I suffer so much when I think of\r\nit ... as of something lamentable and irremediable.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the nostalgia for the strange, for the unaccustomed, that all\r\nborn wanderers know. Fate arranges it for many of them that their lives\r\nshall be uneventful, passed in dull, provincial narrowness; but behind\r\nthese bars the clipped wings of their spirit are always flutteringly\r\nspread for flight. They know not what they seek, what desire drives\r\nthem, but a sense of \"the great adventure\" unachieved keeps them\r\nrestless until they die. It is such as these, these _voyageurs\r\nempassionés_, when condemned by fortune to a static existence--who find\r\ntheir outlet in mental wanderings amid the unusual, the grotesque,\r\nand the monstrous. Hearn and Flaubert both were at heart nomads,\r\nseekers of the unaccustomed; stretching toward immensities of space\r\nand time, toward the ghostly, the hidden, the unrealized. Like that\r\nwild fantastic _Chimera_ of the \"Temptation\" each such soul declares\r\n\"_je cherche des parfums nouveaux, des fleurs plus large, des plaisirs\r\ninéprouvés._\"\r\n\r\nFlaubert was but twenty-six when the first suggestion of his\r\nmasterpiece came to him. For _La Tentation de St. Antoine_, it is\r\ncoming to be understood, is his masterpiece; is one of the greatest\r\nliterary achievements of the French mind. _Madame Bovary_ is more\r\nwidely famous and popular, but Flaubert himself always deeply resented\r\nthis preference, and was always astonished at the comparative\r\nindifference of the world to the \"Temptation.\" He, too, found it\r\ndifficult to realize how hardly the average mind is awakened to an\r\ninterest in the incorporeal; how surely cosmic generalizations escape\r\nthe grasp of the commonplace intelligence.\r\n\r\nWagner waited a lifetime before the world was dragged reluctantly and\r\nresentfully up to a point from which it could discern the superiority\r\nof the tremendous finale of the Götterdämmerung to the Christmas-card\r\nchorus of angels chanting \"_Âme chaste et pure_\" to the beatified\r\nMarguerite. The whole prodigious structure of Wagner's dramatic and\r\nmusical thought might have remained a mere adumbration in the soul of\r\none German had chance not set a mad genius upon the throne of Bavaria.\r\nThe bourgeoisie would--lacking this royal bullying--have continued to\r\nprefer Goethe and Gounod. Flaubert's great work unfortunately failed of\r\nsuch patronage.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1845 that an old picture by Breughel, seen at Genoa, first\r\ninspired Flaubert to attempt the story of St. Anthony. He sought\r\nout an engraving of this conception of Peter the Younger (surnamed\r\n\"Hell-Breughel\" for his fondness for such subjects), hung it on his\r\nwalls at Croisset, and after three years of brooding upon it began,\r\nMay 24, 1848, _La Tentation de St. Antoine._ In twelve months he had\r\nfinished the first draught of the work, which bulked to 540 pages. It\r\nwas laid aside for \"Bovary,\" and a second version of the \"Temptation\"\r\nwas completed in 1856, but this time the manuscript had been reduced\r\nto 193 pages, and the \"blazing phrases, the jewelled words, the\r\nturbulence, the comedy, the mysticism\" of the first version had been\r\nsuperseded by a larger, more dramatic conception. In 1872 he made still\r\na new draught, and by this time it had shrunk to 136 pages. He even\r\nthen eliminated three chapters, and finally gave to the world in 1874\r\n\"this wonderful coloured panorama of philosophy, this Gulliver-like\r\ntravelling amid the master ideas of the antique and early Christian\r\nworlds.\"\r\n\r\nFaguet says, \"In its primitive and legendary state the temptation\r\nof St. Anthony was nothing more than the story of a recluse tempted\r\nby the Devil through the flesh, by all the artifices at the Devil's\r\ndisposal. In the definite thought of Flaubert the temptation of St.\r\nAnthony has become man's soul tempted by all the illusions of human\r\nthought and imagination. St. Anthony to the eyes of the first naive\r\nhagiologists is a second Adam, seduced by woman, who was inspired by\r\nSatan. St. Anthony conceived by Flaubert is a more thoughtful Faust; a\r\nFaust incapable of irony, not a Faust who could play with illusions and\r\nwith himself--secretly persuaded that he could withdraw when he chose\r\nto give himself the trouble to do so--rather a Faust who approached,\r\naccosted, caressed all possible forms of universal illusions.\"\r\n\r\nFlaubert's studies for the \"Temptation\" were tremendous. For nearly\r\nthirty years he touched and retouched, altered, enlarged, condensed.\r\nHe kneaded into its substance the knowledge, incessantly sought, of\r\nall religions and philosophies; of all the forms man's speculations\r\nhad taken in his endless endeavours to explain to himself Life and\r\nFate; humanity's untiring, passionate effort to find the meaning of its\r\nmysterious origin and purpose, and final destiny. How terrible, how\r\nnaive, how fantastic, bloody, grovelling, and outrageous were most of\r\nthe solutions accepted, the gigantic panorama of the book startlingly\r\nsets forth. What gory agonies, what mystic exaltations, what dark\r\ncruelties, frenzied abandons, and inhuman self denials have marked\r\nthose puzzled gropings for light and truth are revealed as by lightning\r\nflashes in the crowding scenes of the epic. For the Temptation of St.\r\nAnthony is an epic. Not a drama of man's actions, as all previous\r\nepics have been, but a drama of the soul. All its movement is in the\r\nadventure and conflict of the spirit. St. Anthony remains always in\r\nthe one place, almost as moveless as a mirror. His vision--clarified\r\nof the sensual and the actual by his fastings and macerations--becomes\r\nlike the surface of an unruffled lake. A lake reflecting the aberrant\r\nforms of thoughts that, like clouds, drift between man and the infinite\r\ndepths of knowledge. Clouds of illusion forever changing, melting,\r\nfusing; assuming forms grotesque, monstrous, intolerable; until at\r\nlast the writhing mists of speculation and ignorance are drunk up\r\nby the widening light of wisdom and the fogs and phantasms vanish,\r\nleaving his consciousness aware, in poignant ecstasy, of the cloudless\r\ndeeps of truth. The temptation of the flesh is but a passing episode.\r\nAn eidolon of Sheba's queen offers him luxury, wealth, voluptuous\r\nbeauty, power, dainty delights of eye and palate in vain. Man has never\r\nfound his most dangerous seductions in the appetites. More lamentable\r\ndisintegration has grown from his attempts to pierce beyond the\r\nbody's veil. The parched and tortured saint is whirled by vertiginous\r\nvisions through cycles of man's straining efforts to know why, whence,\r\nwhither. He assists at the rites of Mithira, the prostrations of\r\nserpent-and-devil-worshippers, worshippers of fire, of light, of the\r\nGreeks' deified forces of nature; of the northern enthronement of brute\r\nforce and war. He is swept by the soothing breath of Quietism, plunges\r\ninto every heresy and philosophy, sees the orgies, the flagellations,\r\nthe self mutilations, the battles and furies of sects, each convinced\r\nthat it has found the answer at last to the Great Question, and\r\nendeavouring to constrain the rest of humanity to accept the answer.\r\nHe meets the Sphinx--embodied interrogation--and the Chimera--the\r\nsimulacrum of the fantasies of the imagination--dashing madly about the\r\nstolid querist.\r\n\r\nLucifer--spirit of doubt of all dogmatic solutions--mounts with Anthony\r\ninto illimitable space. They rise beyond these struggles and furies\r\ninto the cold uttermost of the universe; among innumerable worlds;\r\nworlds yet vaguely forming in the womb of time, newly come to birth,\r\nlustily grown to maturity; worlds dying, decaying, crumbling again into\r\natomic dust. Overcome by the intolerable Vast, Anthony sinks once more\r\nto his cell, and Lucifer, who has shown him the macrocosm, opens to\r\nhim the equal immensity of the microcosm. Makes him see the swarming\r\nlife that permeates the seas, the earth and atmosphere, the incredible\r\nnumerousness of the invisible lives that people every drop of water,\r\nevery grain of sand, every breath of air. The unity of life dawns upon\r\nhim, and his heart, withered by dubiety, melts into joyousness and\r\npeace. As the day dawns in gold he beholds the face of Christ.\r\n\r\nFlaubert's Lucifer has no relation to the jejune Devil of\r\nman's early conception of material evil, nor does he resemble\r\nGoethe's Mephistopheles; embodiment of the Eighteenth Century's\r\nspirit of sneering disbeliefs and negation. He is rather our own\r\ntempter--Science. He is the spirit of Knowledge: Nature itself calling\r\nus to look into the immensities and read just our dogmas by this new\r\nand terrible widening of our mental and moral horizons. This last\r\nexperience of the Saint reproduces the spiritual experiences of the\r\nmodern man; cast loose from his ancient moorings, and yet finding at\r\nlast in his new knowledge a truer conception of the brotherhood of all\r\nlife in all its forms, and seeing still, in the growing light, the\r\nbenignant eyes of God.\r\n\r\nIt is not remarkable that Flaubert resented the banality, the dull\r\ngrossness of the reception of his work, or that Hearn shared his\r\namazement and bitterness. Even yet the world wakes but slowly to the\r\ntrue character of this masterpiece; this epic wrought with so great\r\na care and patience, so instinct with genius, dealing perhaps more\r\nprofoundly than any other mind has ever done with the Great Adventure\r\nof humanity's eternal search for Truth.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH BISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARGUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAILTY\r\n\r\n\r\nSunset in the desert. Enfeebled by prolonged fasting, the hermit\r\nfinds himself unable to concentrate his mind upon holy things. His\r\nthoughts wonder; memories of youth evoke regrets that his relaxed will\r\ncan no longer find strength to suppress,--and, remembrance begetting\r\nremembrance, his fancy leads him upon dangerous ground. He dreams of\r\nhis flight from home,--of Ammonaria, his sister's playmate,--of his\r\nmisery in the waste,--his visit to Alexandria with the blind monk\r\nDidymus,--the unholy sights of the luxurious city.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily he yields to the nervous dissatisfaction growing upon\r\nhim. He laments his solitude, his joylessness, his poverty, the\r\nobscurity of his life; grace departs from him; hope burns low within\r\nhis heart. Suddenly revolting against his weakness, he seeks refuge\r\nfrom distraction in the study of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nVain effort! An invisible hand turns the leaves, placing perilous\r\ntexts before his eyes. He dreams of the Maccabees slaughtering\r\ntheir enemies, and desires that he might do likewise with the\r\nArians of Alexandria;--he becomes inspired with admiration of King\r\nNebuchadnezzar;--he meditates voluptuously upon the visit of Sheba's\r\nqueen of Solomon;--discovers a text in the Acts of the Apostles\r\nantagonistic to principles of monkish ascetism,--indulges in reveries\r\nregarding the riches of Biblical kings and holy men. The Tempter comes\r\nto tempt him with evil hallucinations for which the Saint's momentary\r\nfrailty has paved the way; and with the Evil One come also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN DEADLY SINS\r\n\r\n\r\nPhantom gold is piled up to excite Covetousness; shadowy banquets\r\nappear to evoke Gluttony. The scene shifts to aid the temptations of\r\nAnger and of Pride....\r\n\r\nAnthony finds himself in Alexandria, at the head of a wild army of\r\nmonks slaughtering the heretics and the pagans, without mercy for\r\nage or sex. In fantastic obedience to the course of his fancy while\r\nreading the Scriptures a while before, and like an invisible echo of\r\nhis evil thoughts, the scene changes again. Alexandria is transformed\r\ninto Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAnthony finds himself the honoured of the Emperor. He beholds the\r\nvast circus in all its splendour, the ocean of faces, the tumult of\r\nexcitement. Simultaneously he beholds his enemies degraded to the\r\ncondition of slaves, toiling in the stables of Constantine. He feels\r\njoy in the degradation of the Fathers of Nicæa. Then all is transformed.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer the splendour of Constantinople he beholds under the\r\nluminosity of a Greek day; but the prodigious palace of Nebuchadnezzar\r\nby night. He beholds the orgies, the luxuries, the abominations;--and\r\nthe spirit of Pride enters triumphantly into him as the spirit of\r\nNebuchadnezzar....\r\n\r\nAwaking as from a dream, he finds himself again before his hermitage.\r\nA vast caravan approaches, halts; and the Queen of Sheba descends to\r\ntempt the Saint with the deadliest of all temptations. Her beauty is\r\nenhanced by oriental splendour of adornment; her converse is a song of\r\nwithcraft. The Saint remains firm.... The Seven Deadly Sins depart\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HERESIARCHS\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now the tempter assumes a subtler form. Under the guise of a former\r\ndisciple of Anthony,--Hilarion,--the demon, while pretending to seek\r\ninstruction, endeavours to poison the mind of Anthony with hatred of\r\nthe fathers of the church. He repeats all the scandals amassed by\r\necclesiastical intriguers, all the calumnies created by malice;--he\r\ncites texts only to foment doubt, and quotes the evangels only to\r\nmake confusion. Under the pretext of obtaining mental enlightenment\r\nfrom the wisest of men, he induces Anthony to enter with him into\r\na spectral basilica, wherein are assembled all the Heresiarchs of\r\nthe third century. The hermit is confounded by the multitude of\r\ntenets,--horrified by the blasphemies and abominations of Elkes,\r\nCorpocrates, Valentinus, Manes, Cerdo,--disgusted by the perversions of\r\nthe Paternians, Marcosians, Montanists, Serptians,--bewildered by the\r\napocryphal Gospels of Eve and of Judas, of the Lord, and of Thomas.\r\n\r\nAnd Hilarion grows taller.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARTYRS\r\n\r\nAnthony finds himself in the dungeons of a vast amphitheatre, among\r\nChristians condemned to the wild beasts. By this hallucination the\r\ntempter would prove to the Saint that martyrdom is not always suffered\r\nfor purest motives. Anthony finds the martyrs possessed by bigotry and\r\ninsincerity. He sees many compelled to die against their will; many\r\nwho would forswear their faith could it avail them aught. He beholds\r\nheretics die for their heterodoxy more nobly than orthodox believers.\r\n\r\nAnd he finds himself transported to the tombs of the martyrs. He\r\nwitnesses the meetings of Christian women at the sepulchres. He beholds\r\nthe touching ceremonies of prayer, change into orgies,--lamentations\r\ngive place to amorous dalliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGICIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the Tempter seeks to shake Anthony's faith in the excellence\r\nand evidence of miracles. He assumes the form of a Hindoo Brahmin,\r\nterminating a life of wondrous holiness by self-cremation;--he appears\r\nas Simon Magus and Helen of Tyre,--as Appollonius of Tyans, greatest of\r\nall thaumaturgists, who claims superiority to Christ. All the marvels\r\nrelated by Philostratus are embodied in the converse of Apollonius and\r\nDamis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GODS\r\n\r\n\r\nHilarion reappears taller than ever, growing more gigantic in\r\nproportion to the increasing weakness of the Saint. Standing beside\r\nAnthony he evokes all the deities of the antique world. They defile\r\nbefore him in a marvellous panorama:--Gods of Egypt and India, Chaldea\r\nand Hellas, Babylon and Ultima Thule,--monstrous and multiform, phallic\r\nand ithyphallic, fantastic or obscene. Some intoxicate by their beauty;\r\nothers appall by their foulness. The Buddha recounts the story of his\r\nwondrous life; Venus displays the rounded daintiness of her nudity;\r\nIsis utters awful soliloquy. Lastly the phantom of Jehovah appears, as\r\nthe shadow of a god passing away forever.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the stature of Hilarion towers to the stars; he assumes the\r\nlikeness and luminosity of Lucifer; he announces himself as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Anthony is lifted upon mighty wings and borne away beyond the\r\nworld, above the solar system, above the starry arch of the Milky Way.\r\nAll future discoveries of Astronomy are revealed to him. He is tempted\r\nby the revelation of innumerable worlds,--by the refutation of all\r\nhis previous ideas of the nature of the Universe,--by the enigmas of\r\ninfinity,--by all the marvels that conflict with faith. Even in the\r\nnight of immensity the demon renews the temptation of reason: Anthony\r\nwavers upon the verge of pantheism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUST AND DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony abandoned by the spirit of Science comes to himself in the\r\ndesert. Then the Tempter returns under a two-fold aspect: as the\r\nSpirit of Lust and the Spirit of Destruction. The latter urges him to\r\nsuicide,--the former to indulgence of sense. They inspire him with\r\nstrong fancies of palingenesis, of the illusion of death, of the\r\ncontinuity of life. The pantheistic temptation intensified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONSTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony in reveries meditates upon the monstrous symbols painted upon\r\nthe walls of certain ancient temples. Could he know their meaning\r\nhe might learn also something of the secret lien between Matter and\r\nThought. Forthwith a phantasmagoria of monsters commence to pass before\r\nhis eyes:--the Sphinx and the Chimera, the Blemmyes and Astomi, the\r\nCynocephali and all creatures of mythologie creation. He beholds the\r\nfabulous beings of Oriental imagining,--the abnormities described\r\nby Pliny and Herodotus, the fantasticalities to be later adopted by\r\nheraldry,--the grotesqueries of future medieval illumination made\r\nanimate;--the goblinries and foulnesses of superstitious fancy,--the\r\nWitches' Sabbath of abominations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHOSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe multitude of monsters melts away; the land changes into an Ocean;\r\nthe creatures of the briny abysses appear. And the waters in turn\r\nalso change; seaweeds are transformed to herbs, forests of coral\r\ngive place to forests of trees, polypous life changes to vegetation.\r\nMetals crystallize; frosts effloresce; plants become living things,\r\ninanimate matter takes animate form, monads vibrate, the pantheism of\r\nnature makes itself manifest. Anthony feels a delirious desire to unite\r\nhimself with the Spirit of Universal Being....\r\n\r\nThe vision vanishes. The sun arises. The face of Christ is revealed.\r\nThe temptation has passed; Anthony kneels in prayer.\r\n\r\nL. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY\r\n\r\n\r\n_It is in the Thebaid at the summit of a mountain, upon a platform,\r\nrounded off into the form of a demilune, and enclosed by huge stones._\r\n\r\n_The Hermit's cabin appears in the background. It is built of mud and\r\nreeds, it is flat-roofed and doorless. A pitcher and a loaf of black\r\nbread can be distinguished within also, in the middle of the apartment\r\na large book resting on a wooden STELA; while here and there, fragments\r\nof basketwork, two or three mats, a basket, and a knife lie upon the\r\nground._\r\n\r\n_Some ten paces from the hut, there is a long cross planted in the\r\nsoil; and, at the other end of the platform, an aged and twisted\r\npalm tree leans over the abyss; for the sides of the mountain are\r\nperpendicular, and the Nile appears to form a lake at the foot of the\r\ncliff._\r\n\r\n_The view to right and left is broken by the barrier of rocks. But\r\non the desert-side, like a vast succession of sandy beaches, immense\r\nundulations of an ashen-blonde color extend one behind the other,\r\nrising higher as they recede; and far in the distance, beyond the\r\nsands, the Libyan chain forms a chalk-colored wall, lightly shaded by\r\nviolet mists. On the opposite side the sun is sinking. In the north the\r\nsky is of a pearl-gray tint, while at the zenith purple clouds disposed\r\nlike the tufts of a gigantic mane, lengthen themselves against the blue\r\nvault. These streaks of flame take darker tones; the azure spots turn\r\nto a nacreous pallor; the shrubs, the pebbles, the earth, all now seem\r\nhard as bronze; and throughout space there floats a golden dust so fine\r\nas to become confounded with the vibrations of the light._\r\n\r\n_Saint Anthony, who has a long beard, long hair, and wears a tunic of\r\ngoatskin, is seated on the ground cross-legged, and is occupied in\r\nweaving mats. As soon as the sun disappears, he utters a deep sigh,\r\nand, gazing upon the horizon, exclaims_:--\r\n\r\n\"Another day! another day gone! Nevertheless formerly I used not to\r\nbe so wretched. Before the end of the night I commenced my orisons;\r\nthen I descended to the river to get water, and remounted the rugged\r\npathway with the skin upon my shoulder, singing hymns on the way. Then\r\nI would amuse myself by arranging everything in my hut. I would make my\r\ntools; I tried to make all my mats exactly equal in size, and all my\r\nbaskets light; for then my least actions seemed to me duties in nowise\r\ndifficult or painful of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\"Then at regular hours I ceased working; and when I prayed with my arms\r\nextended, I felt as though a fountain of mercy were pouring from the\r\nheight of heaven into my heart. That fountain is now dried up. Why?\"\r\n\r\n(_He walks up and down slowly, within the circuit of the rocks._)\r\n\r\n\"All blamed me when I left the house. My mother sank to the ground,\r\ndying; my sister from afar off made signs to me to return; and the\r\nother--wept, Ammonaria, the child whom I used to meet every evening\r\nat the cistern, when she took the oxen to drink. She ran after me. Her\r\nfoot rings glittered in the dust; and her tunic, open at the hips,\r\nfluttered loosely in the wind. The aged anchorite who was leading me\r\naway called her vile names. Our two camels galloped forward without\r\nrespite; and I have seen none of my people since that day.\r\n\r\n\"At first, I selected for my dwelling place, the tomb of a Pharaoh. But\r\nan enchantment circulates through all those subterranean palaces, where\r\nthe darkness seems to have been thickened by the ancient smoke of the\r\naromatics. From the depths of Sarcophagi, I heard doleful voices arise,\r\nand call my name; or else, I suddenly beheld the abominable things\r\npainted upon the walls live and move; and I fled away to the shore\r\nof the Red Sea, and took refuge in a ruined citadel. There my only\r\ncompanions were the scorpions dragging themselves among the stones, and\r\nthe eagles continually wheeling above my head, in the blue of heaven.\r\nAt night I was torn by claws, bitten by beaks; soft wings brushed\r\nagainst me; and frightful demons, shrieking in my ears, flung me upon\r\nthe ground. Once I was even rescued by the people of a caravan going\r\nto Alexandria; and they took me away with them.\r\n\r\n\"Then I sought to obtain instruction from the good old man Didymus.\r\nAlthough blind, none equalled him in the knowledge of the Scriptures.\r\nWhen the lesson was finished, he used to ask me to give him my arm\r\nto lean upon, that we might walk together. Then I would conduct him\r\nto the Paneum, whence may be seen the Pharos and the open sea. Then\r\nwe would return by way of the post, elbowing men of all nations,\r\neven Cimmerians clad in the skins of bears and Gymnosophists of the\r\nGanges anointed with cow-dung. But there was always some fighting in\r\nthe streets--either on account of the Jews refusing to pay taxes, or\r\nof seditious people who wished to drive the Romans from the city.\r\nMoreover, the city is full of heretics--followers of Manes; Valentinus,\r\nBasilides, Arius--all seeking to engross my attention in order to argue\r\nwith me and to convince me.\r\n\r\n\"Their discourses often come back to my memory. Vainly do I seek to\r\nbanish them from my mind. They trouble me!\r\n\r\n\"I took refuge at Colzin, and there lived a life of such penance that\r\nI ceased to fear God. A few men, desirous of becoming anchorites,\r\ngathered about me. I imposed a practical rule of life upon them,\r\nhating, as I did, the extravagance of Gnosus and the assertions of the\r\nphilosophers. Messages were sent to me from all parts, and men came\r\nfrom afar off to visit me.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the people were torturing the confessors; and the thirst of\r\nmartyrdom drew me to Alexandria. The persecution had ceased three days\r\nbefore I arrived there!\r\n\r\n\"While returning thence, I was stopped by a great crowd assembled\r\nbefore the temple of Serapis. They told me it was a last example which\r\nthe Governor had resolved to make. In the centre of the portico, under\r\nthe sunlight, a naked woman was fettered to a column, and two soldiers\r\nwere flogging her with thongs; at every blow her whole body writhed.\r\nShe turned round, her mouth open; and over the heads of the crowd,\r\nthrough the long hair half hiding her face, I thought that I could\r\nrecognize Ammonaria....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ... through the long hair half hiding her face,\r\nI thought that I could recognize Ammonaria]\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless ... this one was taller ... and beautiful ...\r\nprodigiously beautiful!\"\r\n\r\n(_He passes his hands over his forehead._)\r\n\r\n\"No! no! I must not think of it!\r\n\r\n\"Another time Athanasius summoned me to assist him against the Arians.\r\nThe contest was limited to invectives and laughter. But since that\r\ntime he has been calumniated, dispossessed of his see, obliged to fly\r\nfor safety elsewhere. Where is he now? I do not know! The people give\r\nthemselves very little trouble to bring me news. All my disciples have\r\nabandoned me--Hilarion like the rest.\r\n\r\n\"He was perhaps fifteen years of age when he first came to me and his\r\nintelligence was so remarkable that he asked me questions incessantly.\r\nThen he used to listen to me with a pensive air, and whatever I needed\r\nhe brought it to me without a murmur--nimbler than a kid, merry enough\r\nto make even the patriarchs laugh. He was a son to me.\"\r\n\r\n(_The sky is red; the earth completely black. Long drifts of sand\r\nfollow the course of the gusts of wind, rising like great shrouds and\r\nfalling again. Suddenly against a bright space in the sky a flock of\r\nbirds pass, forming a triangular battalion, gleaming like one sheet of\r\nmetal, of which the edges alone seem to quiver._\r\n\r\n_Anthony watches them._)\r\n\r\n\"Ah, how I should like to follow them.\r\n\r\n\"How often also have I enviously gazed upon those long vessels,\r\nwhose sails resemble wings--and above all when they were bearing\r\nfar away those I had received at my hermitage! What pleasant hours\r\nwe passed!--what out-pourings of feeling! No one ever interested me\r\nmore than Ammon: he told me of his voyage to Rome, of the Catacombs,\r\nthe Coliseum, the piety of illustrious women, and a thousand other\r\nthings!--and it grieved me to part with him! Wherefore my obstinacy\r\nin continuing to live such a life as this? I would have done well to\r\nremain with the monks of Nitria, inasmuch as they supplicated me to\r\ndo so. They have cells apart, and nevertheless communicate with each\r\nother. On Sundays a trumpet summons them to assemble at the church,\r\nwhere one may see three scourges hanging up, which serve to punish\r\ndelinquents, robbers, and intruders; for their discipline is severe.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless they are not without some enjoyments. The faithful bring\r\nthem eggs, fruits, and even instruments with which they can extract\r\nthorns from their feet. There are vineyards about Prisperi; those\r\ndwelling at Pabena have a raft on which they may journey when they go\r\nto seek provisions.\r\n\r\n\"But I might have served my brethren better as a simple priest. As a\r\npriest one may aid the poor, administer the sacraments, and exercise\r\nauthority over families.\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, all laics are not necessarily damned, and it only\r\ndepended upon my own choice to become--for example--a grammarian, a\r\nphilosopher. I would then have had in my chamber a sphere of reeds,\r\nand tablets always ready at hand, young men around me, and a wreath of\r\nlaurel suspended above my door, as a sign.\r\n\r\n\"But there is too much pride in triumphs such as those. A soldier's\r\nlife would have been preferable. I was robust and bold: bold enough to\r\nfasten the cables of the military machines--to traverse dark forests,\r\nor to enter, armed and helmeted, into smoking cities.... Neither was\r\nthere anything to have prevented me from purchasing with my money the\r\nposition of publican at the toll-office of some bridge; and travellers\r\nwould have taught me many strange things, and told me strange stories,\r\nthe while showing me many curious objects packed up among their\r\nbaggage....\r\n\r\n\"The merchants of Alexandria sail upon the river Canopus on holidays,\r\nand drink wine in the chalices of lotus-flowers, to a music of\r\ntambourines which makes the taverns along the shore tremble! Beyond,\r\ntrees, made cone-shaped by pruning, protect the quiet farms against\r\nthe wind of the south. The roof of the lofty house leans upon thin\r\ncolonettes placed as closely together as the laths of a lattice;\r\nand through their interspaces the master, reclining upon his long\r\ncouch, beholds his plains stretching about him--the hunter among the\r\nwheat-fields--the winepress where the vintage is being converted into\r\nwine, the oxen treading out the wheat. His children play upon the floor\r\naround him; his wife bends down to kiss him.\"\r\n\r\n(_Against the grey dimness of the twilight, here and there appear\r\npointed muzzles, with straight, pointed ears and bright eyes. Anthony\r\nadvances toward them. There is a sound of gravel crumbling down; the\r\nanimals take flight. It was a troop of jackals._\r\n\r\n_One still remains, rising upon his hinder legs, with his body half\r\narched and head raised in an attitude full of defiance._)\r\n\r\n\"How pretty he is! I would like to stroke his back gently!\"\r\n\r\n(_Anthony whistles to coax him to approach. The jackal disappears._)\r\n\r\n\"Ah! he is off to join the others. What solitude! what weariness!\"\r\n(_Laughing bitterly._)\r\n\r\n\"A happy life this indeed!--bending palm-branches in the fire to make\r\nshepherds' crooks, fashioning baskets, stitching mats together--and\r\nthen exchanging these things with the Nomads for bread which breaks\r\none's teeth! Ah! woe, woe is me! will this never end? Surely death were\r\npreferable! I can endure it no more! Enough! enough!\"\r\n\r\n(_He stamps his foot upon the ground, and rushes frantically to and fro\r\namong the rocks; then pauses, out of breath, bursts into tears, and\r\nlies down upon the ground, on his side._\r\n\r\n_The night is calm; multitudes of stars are palpitating; only the\r\ncrackling noise made by the tarantulas is audible._\r\n\r\n_The two arms of the cross make a shadow upon the sand; Anthony, who is\r\nweeping, observes it._)\r\n\r\n\"Am I, then, so weak, O my God! Courage, let me rise from here!\"\r\n\r\n(_He enters his hut, turns over a pile of cinders, finds a live ember,\r\nlights his torch and fixes it upon the wooden desk, so as to throw a\r\nlight upon the great book._)\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I take the Acts of the Apostles?--yes!--no matter where!\"\r\n\r\n_'And he saw the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it\r\nwere a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven to\r\nthe earth--wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts, and creeping\r\nthings of the earth and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to\r\nhim: Arise, Peter! Kill and eat!'_[1]\r\n\r\n\"Then the Lord desired that his apostle should eat of all things?...\r\nwhile I....\"\r\n\r\n(_Anthony remains thoughtful, his chin resting against his breast. The\r\nrustling of the pages, agitated by the wind, causes him to lift his\r\nhead again; and he reads_:)\r\n\r\n_'So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies with the sword,\r\nand killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to\r\nthem...._[2]\r\n\r\n\"Then, comes the number of people slain by them--seventy-five thousand.\r\nThey had suffered so much! Moreover, their enemies were the enemies of\r\nthe true God. And how they must have delighted in avenging themselves\r\nthus by the massacre of idolaters! Doubtless the city must have been\r\ncrammed with the dead! There must have been corpses at the thresholds\r\nof the garden gates, upon the stairways, in all the chambers, and piled\r\nup so high that the doors could no longer move upon their hinges!...\r\nBut lo! here I am permitting my mind to dwell upon ideas of murder and\r\nof blood!...\"\r\n\r\n(_He opens the book at another place._)\r\n\r\n_'Then King Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped\r\nDaniel...._'[3]\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that was just! The _Most High_ exalts his prophets above Kings;\r\nyet that monarch spent his life in banqueting, perpetually drunk with\r\npleasure and pride. But God, to punish him, changed him into a beast!\r\nHe walked upon four feet!\"\r\n\r\n(_Anthony begins to laugh; and in extending his arms, involuntarily\r\ndisarranges the leaves of the book with the tips of his fingers. His\r\neyes fell upon this phrase_:--)\r\n\r\n_'And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming, and he showed them the house\r\nof his aromatical spices, and the gold and the silver, and divers\r\nprecious odours and ointments, and the house of his vessels, and all\r\nthat he had in his treasures....'_[4]\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine that spectacle; they must have beheld precious stones,\r\ndiamonds and darics heaped up to the very roof. One who possesses so\r\nvast an accumulation of wealth is no longer like other men. While\r\nhandling his riches he knows that he controls the total result of\r\ninnumerable human efforts--as it were the life of nations drained by\r\nhim and stored up, which he can pour forth at will. It is a commendable\r\nprecaution on the part of Kings. Even the _Wisest_ of all did not\r\nneglect it. His navy brought him elephants' teeth and apes.... Where is\r\nthat passage?\"\r\n\r\n(_He turns the leaves over rapidly._)\r\n\r\n\"Ah! here it is:\"\r\n\r\n_'And the Queen of Saba, having heard of the fame of Solomon in the\r\nname of the Lord, came to try him with hard questions.'_[5]\r\n\r\n\"How did she hope to tempt him? The _Devil_ indeed sought to tempt\r\nJesus! But Jesus triumphed because he was God; and Solomon, perhaps,\r\nowing this knowledge of magic! It is sublime--that science! For the\r\nworld--as a philosopher once explained it to me, forms a whole, of\r\nwhich all parts mutually influence one another, like the organs of one\r\nbody. It is science which enables us to know the natural loves and\r\nnatural repulsions of all things, and to play upon them?... Therefore,\r\nit is really possible to modify what appears to be the immutable order\r\nof the universe?\"\r\n\r\n(_Then the two shadows formed behind him by the arms of the cross,\r\nsuddenly lengthen and project themselves before him. They assume the\r\nform of two great horns. Anthony cries out_:--)\r\n\r\n\"Help me! O my God!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saint Anthony: Help me, O my God!]\r\n\r\n(_The shadows shrink back to their former place._)\r\n\r\n\"Ah!... it was an illusion ... nothing more. It is needless for me to\r\ntorment my mind further! I can do nothing!--absolutely nothing.\"\r\n\r\n(_He sits down and folds his arms._)\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless ... it seems to me that I felt the approach of.... But\r\nwhy should _He_ come? Besides, do I not know all his artifices? I\r\nrepulsed the monstrous anchorite who laughingly offered me little\r\nloaves of warm, fresh bread, the centaur who sought to carry me away\r\nupon his croup, and that black child who appeared to me in the midst of\r\nthe sands, who was very beautiful, and who told me that he was called\r\nthe Spirit of Lust!\"\r\n\r\n(_Anthony rises and walks rapidly up and down, first to the right, then\r\nto the left._)\r\n\r\n\"It was by my order that this multitude of holy retreats was\r\nconstructed--full of monks all wearing sackcloth of camel's hair\r\nbeneath their garments of goatskin, and numerous enough to form an\r\narmy. I have cured the sick from afar off; I have cast out demons;\r\nI have passed the river in the midst of crocodiles; the Emperor\r\nConstantine wrote me throe letters; Balacius, who had spat upon mine,\r\nwas torn to pieces by his own horses; when I reappeared the people of\r\nAlexandria fought for the pleasure of seeing me, and Athanasius himself\r\nescorted me on the way back. But what works have I not accomplished\r\nLo! for these thirty years and more I have been dwelling and groaning\r\nunceasingly in the desert! Like Eusebius, I have carried thirty-eight\r\npounds of bronze upon my loins; like Macarius, I have exposed my body\r\nto the stings of insects; like Pacomus, I have passed fifty-three\r\nnights without closing my eyes; and those who are decapitated, tortured\r\nwith red hot pincers, or burned alive, are perhaps less meritorious\r\nthan I, seeing that my whole life is but one prolonged martyrdom.\"\r\n(_Anthony slackens his pace._)\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly there is no human being in a condition of such unutterable\r\nmisery! Charitable hearts are becoming scarcer. I no longer receive\r\naught from any one. My mantle is worn out. I have no sandals--I have\r\nnot even a porringer!--for I have distributed all I possessed to the\r\npoor and to my family, without retaining so much as one obolus. Yet\r\nsurely I ought to have a little money to obtain the tools indispensable\r\nto my work? Oh, not much! a very small sum.... I would be very saving\r\nof it....\r\n\r\n\"The fathers of Nicæa, clad in purple robes, sat like magi, upon\r\nthrones ranged along the walls; and they were entertained at a great\r\nbanquet and overwhelmed with honours, especially Paphnutius, because he\r\nis one-eyed and lame, since the persecution of Diocletian! The Emperor\r\nkissed his blind eye several times; what foolishness! Besides, there\r\nwere such infamous men members of that Council! A bishop of Scythia,\r\nTheophilus! another of Persia, John! a keeper of beasts, Spiridion!\r\nAlexander was too old. Athanasius ought to have shown more gentleness\r\ntowards the Arians, so as to have obtained concessions from them.\r\n\r\n\"Yet would they have made any? They would not hear me! The one who\r\nspoke against me--a tall young man with a curly beard--uttered the\r\nmost captious objections to my argument; and while I was seeking words\r\nto express my views they all stared at me with their wicked faces,\r\nand barked like hyenas. Ah! why cannot I have them all exiled by the\r\nEmperor! or rather have them beaten, crushed, and see them suffer! I\r\nsuffer enough myself.\"\r\n\r\n(_He leans against his cabin in a fainting condition._)\r\n\r\n\"It is because I have fasted too long; my strength is leaving me. If I\r\ncould eat--only once more--a piece of meat.\" (_He half closes his eyes\r\nwith languor._)\r\n\r\n\"Ah! some red flesh--a bunch of grapes to bite into ... curdled milk\r\nthat trembles on a plate!...\r\n\r\n\"But what has come upon me? What is the matter with me? I feel my heart\r\nenlarging like the sea, when it swells before the storm. An unspeakable\r\nfeebleness weighs down upon me, and the warm air seems to waft me\r\nthe perfume of a woman's hair. No woman has approached this place;\r\nnevertheless?--\"\r\n\r\n(_He gazes toward the little pathway between the rocks._)\r\n\r\n\"That is the path by which they come, rocked in their litters by the\r\nblack arms of the eunuchs. They descend and joining their hands,\r\nheavy with rings, kneel down before me. They relate to me all their\r\ntroubles. The desire of human pleasure tortures them; they would\r\ngladly die; they have seen in their dreams God calling to them ... and\r\nall the while the hems of their robes fall upon my feet. I repel them\r\nfrom me. 'Ah! no!' they cry, 'not yet! What shall I do?' They gladly\r\naccept any penitence I impose on them. They ask for the hardest of all;\r\nthey beg to share mine and to live with me.\r\n\r\n\"It is now a long time since I have seen any of them! Perhaps some of\r\nthem will come! why not? If I could only hear again, all of a sudden,\r\nthe tinkling of mule-bells among the mountains. It seems to me....\"\r\n\r\n(_Anthony clambers upon a rock at the entrance of the pathway, and\r\nleans over, darting his eyes into the darkness._)\r\n\r\n\"Yes! over there, far off I see a mass moving, like a band of\r\ntravellers seeking the way. _She_ is there!... They are making a\r\nmistake.\" (_Calling._)\r\n\r\n\"This way! Come! Come!\"\r\n\r\n(_Echo repeats: Come! Come! he lets his arms fall, stupefied._)\r\n\r\n\"What shame for me! Alas! poor Anthony.\"\r\n\r\n(_And all of a sudden he hears a whisper:--\"Poor Anthony\"!_)\r\n\r\n\"Who is there? Speak!\"\r\n\r\n(_The wind passing through the intervals between the rocks, makes\r\nmodulations; and in those confused sonorities he distinguishes Voices,\r\nas though the air itself were speaking.

At the edge of the\r\ncliff, the old palm tree with its tuft of yellow leaves, changes into\r\nthe torso of a woman leaning over the abyss, her long hair waving in\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nAnthony turns toward his cabin; and the stool supporting the great book\r\nwhose pages are covered with black letters, seems to him changed into a\r\nbush all covered with nightingales._)\r\n\r\n\"It must be the torch which is making this strange play of light....\r\nLet us put it out!\"\r\n\r\n(_He extinguishes it; the obscurity becomes deeper, the darkness\r\nprofound._\r\n\r\n_And suddenly in the air above there appear and disappear\r\nsuccessively--first, a stretch of water; then the figure of a\r\nprostitute; the corner of a temple, a soldier; a chariot with two white\r\nhorses, prancing._\r\n\r\n_These images appear suddenly, as in flashes--outlined against the\r\nbackground of the night, like scarlet paintings executed upon ebony._\r\n\r\n_Their motion accelerates. They defile by with vertiginous rapidity.\r\nSometimes again, they pause and gradually pale and melt away; or else\r\nfloat off out of sight, to be immediately succeeded by others._\r\n\r\n_Anthony closes his eyelids._\r\n\r\n_They multiply, surround him, besiege him. An unspeakable fear takes\r\npossession of him; and he feels nothing more of living sensation, save\r\na burning contraction of the epigastrium. In spite of the tumult in\r\nhis brain, he is aware of an enormous silence which separates him from\r\nthe world. He tries to speak;--impossible! He feels as though all the\r\nbands of his life were breaking and dissolving;--and, no longer able to\r\nresist, Anthony falls prostrate upon his mat._)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Acts X: 11-13--T.\r\n\r\n[2] Esther IX: 5--T.\r\n\r\n[3] Daniel II: 46.--T.\r\n\r\n[4] Kings XX: 13 (Vulg.).--T.\r\n\r\n[5] III Kings X: I (Vulg.).--T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Then a great shadow, subtler than any natural shadow, and festooned\r\nby other shadows along its edges, defines itself upon the ground._\r\n\r\n_It is the Devil, leaning upon the roof of the hut, and bearing beneath\r\nhis wings--like some gigantic bat suckling its little ones--the Seven\r\nDeadly Sins, whose grimacing heads are dimly distinguishable._\r\n\r\n_With eyes still closed, Anthony yields to the pleasure of inaction;\r\nand stretches his limbs upon the mat._\r\n\r\n_It seems to him quite soft, and yet softer--so that it becomes as if\r\npadded; it rises up; it becomes a bed. The bed becomes a shallop; water\r\nlaps against its sides._\r\n\r\n_To right and left rise two long tongues of land, overlooking low\r\ncultivated plains, with a sycamore tree here and there. In the distance\r\nthere is a tinkling of bells, a sound of drums and of singers. It is a\r\nparty going to Canopus to sleep upon the temple of Serapis, in order\r\nto have dreams. Anthony knows this; and impelled by the wind, his boat\r\nglides along between the banks. Papyrus-leaves and the red flowers of\r\nthe nymphæa, larger than the body of a man, bend over him. He is lying\r\nat the bottom of the boat; one oar at the stem, drags in the water.\r\nFrom time to time, a lukewarm wind blows; and the slender reeds rub one\r\nagainst the other, and rustle. Then the sobbing of the wavelets becomes\r\nindistinct. A heavy drowsiness falls upon him. He dreams that he is a\r\nSolitary of Egypt._\r\n\r\n_Then he awakes with a start._)\r\n\r\n\"Did I dream? It was all so vivid that I can scarcely believe I was\r\ndreaming! My tongue burns. I am thirsty.\"\r\n\r\n(_He enters the cabin, and gropes at random in the dark._)\r\n\r\n\"The ground is wet; can it have been raining? What can this mean! My\r\npitcher is broken into atoms! But the goatskin?\" (_He finds it._)\r\n\r\n\"Empty!--completely empty! In order to get down to the river, I should\r\nhave to walk for at least three hours; and the night is so dark that I\r\ncould not see my way.\r\n\r\n\"There is a gnawing in my entrails. Where is the bread!\"\r\n\r\n(_After long searching, he picks up a crust not so large as an egg._)\r\n\r\n\"What? Have the jackals taken it? Ah! malediction!\"\r\n\r\n(_And he flings the bread upon the ground with fury._\r\n\r\n_No sooner has the action occurred than a table makes its appearance,\r\ncovered with all things that are good to eat._\r\n\r\n_The byssus cloth, striated like the bandelets of the sphinx, produces\r\nof itself luminous undulations. Upon it are enormous quarters of red\r\nmeats; huge fish; birds cooked in their plumage, and quadrupeds in\r\ntheir skins; fruits with colors and tints almost human in appearance;\r\nwhile fragments of cooling ice, and flagons of violet crystal reflect\r\neach other's glittering. Anthony notices in the middle of the table\r\na boar smoking at every pore--with legs doubled up under its belly,\r\nand eyes half closed--and the idea of being able to eat so formidable\r\nan animal greatly delights him. Then many things appear which he has\r\nnever seen before--black hashes, jellies, the color of gold, ragouts in\r\nwhich mushrooms float like nenuphars upon ponds, dishes of whipt cream\r\nlight as clouds._\r\n\r\n_And the aroma of all this comes to him together with the salt smell of\r\nthe ocean, the coolness of mountains, the great perfumes of the woods.\r\nHe dilates his nostrils to their fullest extent; his mouth waters; he\r\nthinks to himself that he has enough before him for a year, for ten\r\nyears, for his whole life!_\r\n\r\n_As he gazes with widely-opened eyes at all these viands, others\r\nappear; they accumulate, forming a pyramid crumbling at all its angles.\r\nThe wines begin to flow over--the fish palpitate--the blood seethes in\r\nthe dishes--the pulp of the fruit protrudes like amorous lips--and the\r\ntable rises as high as his breast, up to his very chin at last--now\r\nbearing only one plate and a single loaf of bread, placed exactly in\r\nfront of him._\r\n\r\n_He extends his hand to seize the loaf. Other loaves immediately\r\npresent themselves to his grasp._)\r\n\r\n\"For me!... all these! But ...\" (_Anthony suddenly draws back._)\r\n\r\n\"Instead of one which was there, lo! there are many! It must be a\r\nmiracle, then, the same as our Lord wrought!\r\n\r\n\"Yet for what purpose?... Ah! all the rest of these things are equally\r\nincomprehensible!

But how well I delivered myself from\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n(_He lifts his head, and at the same time stumbles over some sonorous\r\nobject._)\r\n\r\n\"Why! what can that be?\" (_Anthony stoops down._)\r\n\r\n\"How! a cup! Some traveller must have lost it here. There is nothing\r\nextraordinary....\"\r\n\r\n(_He wets his finger, and rubs._)\r\n\r\n\"It glitters!--metal! Still, I cannot see very clearly....\"\r\n\r\n(_He lights his torch, and examines the cup._)\r\n\r\n\"It is silver, ornamented with ovules about the rim, with a medal at\r\nthe bottom of it.\"\r\n\r\n(_He detaches the medal with his nail!_)\r\n\r\n\"It is a piece of money worth about seven or eight drachmas--not more!\r\nIt matters not! even with that I could easily buy myself a sheepskin.\"\r\n\r\n(_A sudden flash of the torch lights up the cup._)\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! gold? Yes, all gold, solid gold!\"\r\n\r\n(_A still larger piece of money appears at the bottom. Under it he\r\nperceives several others._)\r\n\r\n\"Why, this is a sum ... large enough to purchase three oxen ... and a\r\nlittle field!\"\r\n\r\n(_The cup is now filled with pieces of gold._)\r\n\r\n\"What! what!... a hundred slaves, soldiers, a host ... enough to\r\nbuy....\"\r\n\r\n(_The granulations of the rim, detaching themselves form a necklace of\r\npearls._)\r\n\r\n\"With such a marvel of jewelry as that, one could win even the wife of\r\nthe Emperor!\"\r\n\r\n(_By a sudden jerk, Anthony makes the necklace slip down over his\r\nwrist. He holds the cup in his left hand, and with his right lifts\r\nup the torch so as to throw the light upon it. As water streams\r\noverflowing from the basin of a fountain, so diamonds, carbuncles, and\r\nsapphires, all mingled with broad pieces of gold bearing the effigies\r\nof Kings, overflow from the cup in never ceasing streams, to form a\r\nglittering hillock upon the sand._)\r\n\r\n\"What! how! Staters, cycles, dariacs, aryandics; Alexander, Demetrius,\r\nthe Ptolemies, Cæsar!--yet not one of them all possessed so much!\r\nNothing is now impossible! no more suffering for me! how these\r\ngleams dazzle my eyes! Ah! my heart overflows! how delightful it is!\r\nyes--yes!--more yet! never could there be enough! Vainly I might\r\ncontinually fling it into the sea, there would always be plenty\r\nremaining for me. Why should I lose any of it? I will keep all, and say\r\nnothing to any one about it; I will have a chamber hollowed out for me\r\nin the rock, and lined with plates of bronze, and I will come here from\r\ntime to time to feel the gold sinking down under the weight of my heel;\r\nI will plunge my arms into it as into sacks of grain! I will rub my\r\nface with it, I will lie down upon it!\"\r\n\r\n(_He flings down the torch in order to embrace the glittering heap, and\r\nfalls flat upon the ground._\r\n\r\n_He rises to his feet. The place is wholly empty._)\r\n\r\n\"What have I done!\r\n\r\n\"Had I died during those moments, I should have gone to hell--to\r\nirrevocable damnation.\"\r\n\r\n(_He trembles in every limb._)\r\n\r\n\"Am I, then, accursed? Ah! no; it is my own fault! I allow myself\r\nto be caught in every snare! No man could be more imbecile, more\r\ninfamous! I should like to beat myself, or rather to tear myself out\r\nof my own body! I have restrained myself too long. I feel the want of\r\nvengeance--the necessity of striking, of killing!--as though I had a\r\npack of wild beasts within me! Would that I could hew my way with an\r\naxe, through the midst of a multitude.... Ah, a poniard!...\"\r\n\r\n(_He perceives his knife, and rushes to seize it. The knife slips from\r\nhis hand; and Anthony remains leaning against the wall of his hut, with\r\nwide-open mouth, motionless, cataleptic._\r\n\r\n_Everything about him has disappeared._\r\n\r\n_He thinks himself at Alexandria, upon the Paneum--an artificial\r\nmountain in the centre of the city, encircled by a winding stairway._\r\n\r\n_Before him lies Lake Mareolis; on his right hand is the sea, on his\r\nleft the country; and immediately beneath him a vast confusion of\r\nflat roofs, traversed from north to south and from east to west by\r\ntwo streets which intercross, and which offer throughout their entire\r\nlength the spectacle of files of porticoes with Corinthian columns. The\r\nhouses overhanging this double colonnade have windows of stained glass.\r\nSome of them support exteriorly enormous wooden cages, into which the\r\nfresh air rushes from without._\r\n\r\n_Monuments of various architecture tower up in close proximity.\r\nEgyptian pylons dominate Greek temples. Obelisks appear like lances\r\nabove battlements of red brick. In the middle of public squares there\r\nare figures of Hermes with pointed ears, and of Anubis with the head of\r\na dog. Anthony can distinguish the mosaic pavements of the courtyards,\r\nand tapestries suspended from the beams of ceilings._\r\n\r\n_He beholds at one glance, the two ports (the Great Port and the\r\nEunostus), both round as circuses, and separated by a mole connecting\r\nAlexandria with the craggy island upon which the Pharos-tower\r\nrises--quadrangular, five hundred cubits high, nine storied, having at\r\nits summit a smoking heap of black coals._\r\n\r\n_Small interior ports open into the larger ones. The mole terminates at\r\neach end in a bridge supported upon marble columns planted in the sea.\r\nSailing vessels pass beneath it, while heavy lighters overladen with\r\nmerchandise, thalamegii[1] inlaid with ivory, gondolas covered with\r\nawnings, triremes, biremes, and all sorts of vessels are moving to and\r\nfro, or lie moored at the wharves._\r\n\r\n_About the Great Port extends an unbroken array of royal construction:\r\nthe palace of the Ptolomies, the Museum, the Posidium, the Cæsareum,\r\nthe Timonium where Mark Anthony sought refuge, the Soma which contains\r\nthe tomb of Alexander; while at the other extremity of the city, beyond\r\nthe Eunostus, the great glass factories, perfume factories, and papyrus\r\nfactories may be perceived in a suburban quarter._\r\n\r\n_Strolling peddlers, porters, ass-drivers run and jostle together.\r\nHere and there one observes some priest of Isis wearing a panther skin\r\non his shoulders, a Roman soldier with his bronze helmet, and many\r\nnegroes. At the thresholds of the shops women pause, artisans ply their\r\ntrades; and the grinding noise of chariot wheels puts to flight the\r\nbirds that devour the detritus of the butcher-shops and the morsels of\r\nfish left upon the ground._\r\n\r\n_The general outline of the streets seems like a black network flung\r\nupon the white uniformity of the houses. The markets stocked with\r\nherbs make green bouquets in the midst of it; the drying-yards of the\r\ndyers, blotches of color; the golden ornaments of the temple-pediments,\r\nluminous points--all comprised within the oval enclosure of the grey\r\nramparts, under the vault of the blue heaven, beside the motionless\r\nsea._\r\n\r\n_But suddenly the movement of the crowd ceases; all turn their\r\neyes toward the west, whence enormous whirlwinds of dust are seen\r\napproaching._\r\n\r\n_It is the coming of the monks of the Thebaid, all clad in goatskins,\r\narmed with cudgels, roaring a canticle of battle and of faith with the\r\nrefrain_:\r\n\r\n\"Where are they? Where are they?\"\r\n\r\n_Anthony understands that they are coming to kill the Arians._\r\n\r\n_The streets are suddenly emptied--only flying feet are visible._\r\n\r\n_The Solitaries are now in the city. Their formidable cudgels, studded\r\nwith nails, whirl in the air like suns of steel. The crash of things\r\nbroken in the houses is heard. There are intervals of silence. Then\r\ngreat screams arise._\r\n\r\n_From one end of the street to the other there is a continual eddy of\r\nterrified people._\r\n\r\n_Many grasp pikes. Sometimes two bands meet, rush into one; and this\r\nmass of men slips upon the pavement--fighting, disjointing, knocking\r\ndown. But the men with the long hair always reappear._\r\n\r\n_Threads of smoke begin to escape from the corners of edifices! folding\r\ndoors burst open. Portions of walls crumble down. Architraves fall._\r\n\r\n_Anthony finds all his enemies again, one after the other. He even\r\nrecognizes some whom he had altogether forgotten; before killing them\r\nhe outrages them. He disembowels--he severs throats--he fells as in\r\na slaughter house--he hales old men by the beard, crushes children,\r\nsmites the wounded. And vengeance is taken upon luxury, those who\r\ndo not know how to read tear up hooks; others smash and deface the\r\nstatues, paintings, furniture, caskets,--a thousand dainty things\r\nthe use of which they do not know, and which simply for that reason\r\nexasperates them. At intervals they pause, out of breath, in the work\r\nof destruction; then they recommence._\r\n\r\n_The inhabitants moan in the courtyards where they have sought refuge.\r\nThe women raise their tearful eyes and lift their naked arms to heaven.\r\nIn hope of moving the Solitaries they embrace their knees; the men cast\r\nthem off and fling them down, and the blood gushes to the ceilings,\r\nfalls back upon the walls like sheets of rain, streams from the trunks\r\nof decapitated corpses, fills the aqueducts, forms huge red pools upon\r\nthe ground._\r\n\r\n_Anthony is up to his knees in it. He wades in it; he sucks up the\r\nblood-spray on his lips; he is thrilled with joy as he feels it upon\r\nhis limbs, under his hair-tunic which is soaked through with it._\r\n\r\n_Night comes. The immense uproar dies away._\r\n\r\n_The Solitaries have disappeared._\r\n\r\n_Suddenly, upon the outer galleries corresponding to each of the nine\r\nstories of the Pharos, Anthony observes thick black lines forming, like\r\nlines of crows perching. He hurries thither; and soon finds himself at\r\nthe summit._\r\n\r\n_A huge mirror of brass turned toward the open sea, reflects the forms\r\nof the vessels in the offing._\r\n\r\n_Anthony amuses himself by watching them; and while he watches, their\r\nnumber increases._\r\n\r\n_They are grouped together within a gulf which has the form of a\r\ncrescent. Upon a promontory in the background, towers a new city of\r\nRoman architecture, with cupolas of stone, conical roofs, gleams of\r\npink and blue marbles, and a profusion of brazen ornamentation applied\r\nto the volutes of the capitals, to the angles of the cornices, to the\r\nsummits of the edifices. A cypress-wood overhangs the city. The line of\r\nthe sea is greener, the air colder. The mountains lining the horizon\r\nare capped with snow._\r\n\r\n_Anthony is trying to find his way, when a man approaches him, and\r\nsays_:\r\n\r\n\"Come! they are waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\n_He traverses a forum, enters a great court, stoops beneath a low\r\ndoor; and he arrives before the facade of the palace, decorated\r\nwith a group in wax, representing Constantine overcoming a dragon.\r\nThere is a porphyry basin, from the centre of which rises a golden\r\nconch-shell full of nuts. His guide tells him that he may take some of\r\nthem. He does so. Then he is lost, as it were, in a long succession of\r\napartments._\r\n\r\n_There are mosaics upon the walls representing generals presenting\r\nthe Emperor with conquered cities, which they hold out upon the\r\npalms of their hands. And there are columns of basalt everywhere,\r\ntrellis-work in silver filigree, ivory chairs, tapestries embroidered\r\nwith pearls. The light falls from the vaults above; Anthony still\r\nproceeds. Warm exhalations circulate about him; occasionally he hears\r\nthe discreet clapping sound of sandals upon the pavement. Posted in\r\nthe anti-chambers are guards, who resemble automata, holding wands of\r\nvermillion upon their shoulders._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: And there are columns of basalt everywhere,... The\r\nlight falls from the vaults above]\r\n\r\n_At last he finds himself in a great hall, with hyacinth-colored\r\ncurtains at the further end. They part, and display the Emperor seated\r\non a throne, clad in a violet tunic, and wearing red shoes striped with\r\nbands of black._\r\n\r\n_A diadem of pearls surround his head; his locks are arranged\r\nsymmetrically in rouleaux. He has a straight nose, drooping eyelids,\r\na heavy and cunning physiognomy. At the four corners of the dais\r\nstretched above his head are placed four golden doves; and at the foot\r\nof the throne are two lions in enamel crouching. The doves begin to\r\nsing, the lions to roar. The Emperor rolls his eyes; Anthony advances;\r\nand forthwith, without preamble, they commence to converse about\r\nrecent events. In the cities of Antioch, Ephesus, and Alexandria,\r\nthe temples have been sacked, and the statues of the gods converted\r\ninto pots and cooking utensils; the Emperor laughs heartily about it.\r\nAnthony reproaches him with his tolerance toward the Novations. But the\r\nEmperor becomes vexed. Novations, Arians or Meletians--he is sick of\r\nthem all! Nevertheless, he admires the episcopate; for inasmuch as the\r\nChristians maintain bishops, who depend for their position upon five or\r\nsix important personages, it is only necessary to gain over the latter,\r\nin order to have all the rest on one's side. Therefore he did not fail\r\nto furnish them with large sums. But he detests the Fathers of the\r\nCouncil of Nicæa._\r\n\r\n\"Let us go and see them!\"\r\n\r\n_Anthony follows him._\r\n\r\n_And they find themselves on a terrace, upon the same floor._\r\n\r\n_It overlooks a hippodrome thronged with people, and surmounted by\r\nporticoes where other spectators are walking to and fro. From the\r\ncentre of the race-course rises a narrow platform of hewn stone,\r\nsupporting a little temple of Mercury, the statue of Constantine, and\r\nthree serpents of brass twisted into a column; there are three huge\r\nwooden eggs at one end, and at the other a group of seven dolphins with\r\ntheir tails in the air._\r\n\r\n_Behind the imperial pavilion sit the Prefects of the Chambers, the\r\nCounts of the Domestics, and the Patricians--in ranks rising by tiers\r\nto the first story of a church whose windows are thronged with women.\r\nOn the right is the tribune of the Blue Faction; on the left, that of\r\nthe Green; below, a picket of soldiers is stationed; and on a level\r\nwith the arena is a row of Corinthian arches, forming the entrances to\r\nthe stables._\r\n\r\n_The races are about to commence; the horses are drawn up in line.\r\nLofty plumes, fastened between their ears, bend to the wind like\r\nsaplings; and with every restive bound, they shake their chariots\r\nviolently, which are shell-shaped, and conducted by charioteers clad\r\nin a sort of multi-colored cuirass, having sleeves tight at the wrist\r\nand wide in the arms; their legs are bare; their beards, faces and\r\nforeheads are shaven after the manner of the Huns._\r\n\r\n_Anthony is at first deafened by the billowy sound of voices. From\r\nthe summit of the hippodrome to its lowest tiers, he sees only faces\r\npainted with rouge, garments checkered and variegated with many colors,\r\nflashing jewelry; and the sand of the arena, all white, gleams like a\r\nmirror._\r\n\r\n_The Emperor entertains him. He confides to him many matters of high\r\nimportance, many secrets; he confesses the assassination of his son\r\nCriopus, and even asks Anthony for advice regarding his health._\r\n\r\n_Meanwhile Anthony notices some slaves in the rear portion of the\r\nstables below. They are the Fathers of Nicæa, ragged and abject. The\r\nmartyr Paphnutius is brushing the mane of one horse; Theophilus is\r\nwashing the legs of another; John is painting the hoofs of a third;\r\nAlexander is collecting dung in a basket._\r\n\r\n_Anthony passes through the midst of them. They range themselves on\r\neither side respectfully; they beseech his intercession; they kiss his\r\nhands. The whole assemblage of spectators hoots at them; and he enjoys\r\nthe spectacle with immeasurable pleasure. Lo! he is now one of the\r\ngrandees of the Court--the Emperor's confidant--the prime minister!\r\nConstantine places his own diadem upon his brows. Anthony allows it to\r\nremain upon his head, thinking this honor quite natural._\r\n\r\n_And suddenly in the midst of the darkness a vast hall appears,\r\nilluminated by golden candelabra._\r\n\r\n_Candles so lofty that they are half lost in the darkness, stretch away\r\nin huge files beyond the lines of banquet-tables, which seem to extend\r\nto the horizon, where through a luminous haze loom superpositions of\r\nstairways, suites of arcades, colossi, towers, and beyond all a vague\r\nborder of palace walls, above which rise the crests of cedars, making\r\nyet blacker masses of blackness against the darkness._\r\n\r\n_The guests, crowned with violet wreaths, recline upon very low couches\r\nand are leaning upon their elbows. Along the whole length of this\r\ndouble line of couches, wine is being poured out from amphoræ, and at\r\nthe further end, all alone, coiffed with the tiara and blazing with\r\ncarbuncles, King Nebuchadnezzar eats and drinks._\r\n\r\n_On his right and left, two bands of priests in pointed caps are\r\nswinging censers. On the pavement below crawl the captive kings whose\r\nhands and feet have been cut off; from time to time he flings them\r\nbones to gnaw. Further off sit his brothers, with bandages across their\r\neyes, being all blind._\r\n\r\n_From the depths of the ergastula arise moans of ceaseless pain. Sweet\r\nslow sounds of a hydraulic organ alternate with choruses of song; and\r\none feels that all about the palace without extends an immeasurable\r\ncity--an ocean of human life whose waves break against the walls. The\r\nslaves run hither and thither carrying dishes. Women walk between the\r\nranks of guests, offering drinks to all; the baskets groan under their\r\nburthen of loaves; and a dromedary, laden with perforated water-skins:\r\npasses and repasses through the hall, sprinkling and cooling the\r\npavement with vervain._\r\n\r\n_Lion tamers are leading tamed lions about. Dancing girls--their\r\nhair confined in nets--balance themselves and turn upon their hands,\r\nemitting fire through their nostrils; negro boatmen are juggling; naked\r\nchildren pelt each other with pellets of snow, which burst against the\r\nbright silverware. There is an awful clamor as of a tempest; and a huge\r\ncloud hangs over the banquet--so numerous are the meats and breaths.\r\nSometimes a flake of fire torn from the great flambeaux by the wind,\r\ntraverses the night like a shooting star._\r\n\r\n_The king wipes the perfumes from his face with his arm. He eats from\r\nthe sacred vessels--then breaks them; and secretly reckons up the\r\nnumber of his fleets, his armies, and his subjects. By and by, for a\r\nnew caprice, he will burn his palace with all its guests. He dreams of\r\nrebuilding the tower of Babel, and dethroning God._\r\n\r\n_Anthony, from afar off, reads all these thoughts upon his brow. They\r\npenetrate his own brain, and he becomes Nebuchadnezzar. Immediately he\r\nis cloyed with orgiastic excesses, sated with fury of extermination;\r\nand a great desire comes upon him to wallow in vileness. For the\r\ndegradation of that which terrifies men is an outrage inflicted upon\r\ntheir minds--it affords yet one more way to stupefy them; and as\r\nnothing is viler than a brute, Anthony goes upon the table on all\r\nfours, and bellows like a bull._\r\n\r\n_He feels a sudden pain in his hand--a pebble has accidentally wounded\r\nhim--and he finds himself once more in front of his cabin._\r\n\r\n_The circle of the rocks is empty. The stars are glowing in the sky.\r\nAll is hushed._)\r\n\r\n\"Again have I allowed myself to be deceived! Why these things? They\r\ncome from the rebellion of the flesh. Ah! wretch!\"\r\n\r\n(_He rushes into his cabin, and seizes a bunch of thongs, with metallic\r\nhooks attached to their ends, strips himself to the waist and, lifting\r\nhis eyes to heaven exclaims_:)\r\n\r\n\"Accept my penance, O my God: disdain it not for its feebleness. Render\r\nit sharp, prolonged, excessive! It is time, indeed!--to the work!\"\r\n\r\n(_He gives himself a vigorous lash--and shrieks._)\r\n\r\n\"No! no!--without mercy it must be.\"\r\n\r\n(_He recommences._)\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh! oh! each lash tears my skin, rends my limbs! It burns me\r\nhorribly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay!--it is not so very terrible after all!--one becomes accustomed to\r\nit. It even seems to me....\"\r\n\r\n(_Anthony pauses._)\r\n\r\n\"Continue, coward! continue! Good! good!--upon the arms, on the back,\r\non the breast, on the belly--everywhere! Hiss, ye thongs! bite me!\r\ntear me! I would that my blood could spurt to the stars!--let my bones\r\ncrack!--let my tendons be laid bare! O for pincers, racks, and melted\r\nlead! The martyrs have endured far worse; have they not, Ammonaria?\"\r\n\r\n(_The shadow of the Devil's horns reappears._)\r\n\r\n\"I might have been bound to the column opposite to thine,--face to\r\nface--under thy eyes--answering thy shrieks by my sighs; and our pangs\r\nmight have been interblended, our souls intermingled.\"\r\n\r\n(_He lashes himself with fury._)\r\n\r\n\"What! what! again. Take that!--But how strange a titillation thrills\r\nme! What punishment! what pleasure! I feel as though receiving\r\ninvisible kisses; the very marrow of my bones seems to melt. I die....\"\r\n\r\n_And he sees before him three cavaliers, mounted upon onagers, clad in\r\nrobes of green--each holding a lily in his hand, and all resembling\r\neach other in feature._\r\n\r\n_Anthony turns round, and beholds three other cavaliers exactly\r\nsimilar, riding upon similar onagers, and preserving the same attitude._\r\n\r\n_He draws back. Then all the onagers advance one pace at the same time,\r\nand rub their noses against him, trying to bite his garment. Voices\r\nshout_:--\r\n\r\n\"Here! here! this way!\"\r\n\r\n_And between the clefts of the mountain, appear standards,--camels'\r\nheads with halters of red silk--mules laden with baggage, and women\r\ncovered with yellow veils, bestriding piebald horses._\r\n\r\n_The panting beasts lie down; the slaves rush to the bales and\r\npackages, motley-striped carpets are unrolled; precious glimmering\r\nthings are laid upon the ground._\r\n\r\n_A white elephant, caparisoned with a golden net, trots forward,\r\nshaking the tuft of ostrich plumes attached to his head-band._\r\n\r\n_Upon his back, perched on cushions of blue wool, with her legs\r\ncrossed, her eyes half closed, her comely head sleepily nodding, is a\r\nwoman so splendidly clad that she radiates light about her. The crowd\r\nfalls prostrate; the elephant bends his knees; and_\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN OF SHEBA\r\n\r\n_letting herself glide down from his shoulder upon the carpets spread\r\nto receive her, approaches Saint Anthony._\r\n\r\n_Her robe of gold brocade, regularly divided by furbelows of pearls,\r\nof jet, and of sapphires, sheaths her figure closely with its\r\ntight-fitting bodice, set off by colored designs representing the\r\ntwelve signs of the Zodiac. She wears very high pattens--one of which\r\nis black, and sprinkled with silver stars, with a moon crescent; the\r\nother, which is white, is sprinkled with a spray of gold, with a golden\r\nsun in the middle._\r\n\r\n_Her wide sleeves, decorated with emeralds and bird-plumes, leave\r\nexposed her little round bare arms, clasped at the wrist by ebony\r\nbracelets; and her hands, loaded with precious rings, are terminated by\r\nnails so sharply pointed that the ends of her fingers seem almost like\r\nneedles._\r\n\r\n_A chain of dead gold, passing under her chin, is caught up on either\r\nside of her face, and spirally coiled about her coiffure, whence,\r\nredescending, it grazes her shoulders and is attached upon her bosom\r\nto a diamond scorpion, which protrudes a jewelled tongue between her\r\nbreasts. Two immense blond pearls depend heavily from her ears. The\r\nborders of her eyelids are painted black. There is a natural brown spot\r\nupon her left cheek; and she opens her mouth in breathing, as if her\r\ncorset inconvenienced her._\r\n\r\n_She shakes, as she approaches, a green parasol with an ivory handle,\r\nand silver-gilt bells attached to its rim; twelve little woolly-haired\r\nnegro-boys support the long train of her robe, whereof an ape holds the\r\nextremity, which it raises up from time to time. She exclaims_:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! handsome hermit! handsome hermit!--my heart swoons!\r\n\r\n\"By dint of stamping upon the ground with impatience, callosities have\r\nformed upon my heel, and I have broken one of my nails. I sent out\r\nshepherds, who remained upon the mountain tops, shading their eyes with\r\ntheir hands--and hunters who shouted thy name in all the forests--and\r\nspies who travelled along the highways, asking every passer-by:\r\n\r\n\"'Hast thou seen him?'\r\n\r\n\"By night I wept, with my face turned to the wall. And at last my tears\r\nmade two little holes in the mosaic, like two pools of water among the\r\nrocks;--for I love thee!--oh! how I love thee!\"\r\n\r\n(_She takes him by the beard._)\r\n\r\n\"Laugh now, handsome hermit! laugh! I am very joyous, very gay: thou\r\nshalt soon see! I play the lyre; I dance like a bee; and I know a host\r\nof merry tales to tell, each more diverting than the other.\r\n\r\n\"Thou canst not even imagine how mighty a journey we have made. See!\r\nthe onagers upon which the green couriers rode are dead with fatigue!\"\r\n\r\n(_The onagers are lying motionless upon the ground._)\r\n\r\n\"For three long moons they never ceased to gallop on with the same\r\nequal pace, holdings flints between their teeth to cut the wind, their\r\ntails ever streaming out behind them, their sinews perpetually strained\r\nto the uttermost, always galloping, galloping. Never can others be\r\nfound like them. They were bequeathed me by my paternal grand-father,\r\nthe Emperor Saharil, son of Iakhschab, son of Iaarab, son of Kastan.\r\nAh! if they were still alive, we should harness them to a litter that\r\nthey might bear us back speedily to the palace! But ... what ails\r\nthee?--of what art thou dreaming?\"\r\n\r\n(_She stares at him, examines him closely._)\r\n\r\n\"Ah, when thou shalt be my husband, I will robe thee, I will perfume\r\nthee, I will depilate thee.\"\r\n\r\n(_Anthony remains motionless, more rigid than a stake, more pallid\r\nthan a corpse._)\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast a sad look--is it because of leaving thy hermitage? Yet I\r\nhave left everything for thee--even King Solomon, who, nevertheless,\r\npossesses much wisdom, twenty thousand chariots of war, and a beautiful\r\nbeard. I have brought thee my wedding gifts. Choose!\"\r\n\r\n(_She walks to and fro among the ranks of slaves and the piles of\r\nprecious goods._)\r\n\r\n\"Here is Genezareth balm, incense from Cape Gardefui, labdanum,\r\ncinnamon, and silphium--good to mingle with sauces. In that bale are\r\nAssyrian embroideries, ivory from the Ganges, purple from Elissa;\r\nand that box of snow contains a skin of chalybon, the wine, which\r\nis reserved for the Kings of Assyria, and which is drunk from the\r\nhorn of a unicorn. Here are necklaces, brooches, nets for the hair,\r\nparasols, gold powder from Baasa, cassiteria from Tartessus, blue wood\r\nfrom Pandio, white furs from Issidonia, carbuncles from the Island\r\nPalæsimondus, and toothpicks made of the bristles of the tachas--that\r\nlost animal which is found under the earth. These cushions come from\r\nEmath, and these mantle-fringes from Palmyra. On this Babylonian carpet\r\nthere is.... But come hither! come! come!\"\r\n\r\n(_She pulls Saint Anthony by the sleeve. He resists. She continues_:)\r\n\r\n\"This thin tissue which crackles under the finger with a sound as of\r\nsparks, is the famous yellow cloth which the merchants of Bactria bring\r\nus. I will have robes made of it for thee, which thou shalt wear in the\r\nhouse. Unfasten the hooks of that sycamore box, and hand me also the\r\nlittle ivory casket tied to my elephant's shoulder.\"\r\n\r\n(_They take something round out of a box--something covered with a\r\ncloth--and also bring a little ivory casket covered with carving._)\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou desire the buckler of Dgian-ben-Dgian, who built the\r\npyramids?--behold it!--It is formed of seven dragon-skins laid one over\r\nthe other, tanned in the bile of parricides, and fastened together by\r\nadamantine screws. Upon one side are represented all the wars that have\r\ntaken place since the invention of weapons; and upon the other, all the\r\nwars that will take place until the end of the world. The lightning\r\nitself rebounds from it like a ball of cork. I am going to place it\r\nupon thy arm; and thou wilt carry it during the chase.\r\n\r\n\"But if thou didst only know what I have in this little box of mine!\r\nTurn it over and over again! try to open it! No one could ever succeed\r\nin doing that. Kiss me! and I will tell thee how to open it.\"\r\n\r\n(_She takes Saint Anthony by both cheeks. He pushes her away at arms'\r\nlength._)\r\n\r\n\"It was one night that King Solomon lost his head. At last we concluded\r\na bargain.

I have treasures\r\nconcealed in winding galleries where one would lose one's way, as\r\nin a forest. I have summer-palaces constructed in trellis-work of\r\nreeds, and winter-palaces all built of black marble. In the midst of\r\nlakes vast as seas, I have islands round as pieces of silver, and all\r\ncovered with mother-of-pearl,--islands whose shores make music to\r\nthe lapping of tepid waves upon the sand. The slaves of my kitchens\r\ncatch birds in my aviaries, and fish in my fishponds. I have engravers\r\ncontinually seated at their benches to hollow out my likeness in hard\r\njewel-stones, and panting molders forever casting statues of me, and\r\nperfumers incessantly mingling the sap of rare plants with vinegar,\r\nor preparing cosmetic pastes. I have female dressmakers cutting out\r\npatterns in richest material, goldsmiths cutting and mounting jewels of\r\nprice, and careful painters pouring upon my palace wainscoting boiling\r\nresins, which they subsequently cool with fans. I have enough female\r\nattendants to form a harem, eunuchs enough to make an army. I have\r\narmies likewise; I have nations! In the vestibule of my palace I keep a\r\nguard of dwarfs--all bearing ivory trumpets at their backs.\" (_Anthony\r\nsighs._)\r\n\r\n\"I have teams of trained gazelles; I have elephant quadrigæ; I have\r\nhundreds of pairs of camels, and mares whose manes are so long that\r\ntheir hoofs become entangled therein when they gallop, and herds of\r\ncattle with horns so broad that when they go forth to graze the woods\r\nhave to be hewn down before them. I have giraffes wandering in my\r\ngardens; they stretch their heads over the edge of my roof, when I take\r\nthe air after dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Seated in a shell drawn over the waters by dolphins, I travel\r\nthrough the grottoes, listening lo the dropping of the water from the\r\nstalactites. I go down to the land of diamonds, where my friends the\r\nmagicians allow me to choose the finest: then I reascend to earth and\r\nreturn to my home.\"\r\n\r\n(_She utters a sharp whistle; and a great bird, descending from the\r\nsky, alights upon her hair, from which it makes the blue powder fall._\r\n\r\n_Its orange-colored plumage seems formed of metallic scales. Its little\r\nhead, crested with a silver tuft, has a human face._\r\n\r\n_It has four wings, the feet of a vulture, and an immense peacock's\r\ntail which it spreads open like a fan._\r\n\r\n_It seizes the Queen's parasol in its beak, reels a moment ere\r\nobtaining its balance; then it erects all its plumes, and remains\r\nmotionless._)\r\n\r\n\"Thanks! my beautiful Simorg-Anka!--thou didst tell me where the loving\r\none was hiding!

I have a pavilion\r\non a promontory in the middle of an isthmus dividing two oceans.

From its height I watch my fleets\r\ncome in, and my nations toiling up the mountain-slopes with burthens\r\nupon their shoulders.

The possession of the least part\r\nof me will fill thee with a joy more vehement than the conquest of an\r\nEmpire could give thee! Approach thy lips: there is a sweetness in my\r\nkisses as of a fruit dissolving within thy heart. Ah! how thou wilt\r\nlose thyself beneath my long hair, inhale the perfume of my bosom,\r\nmadden thyself with the beauty of my limbs: and thus, consumed by the\r\nfire of my eyes, clasped within my arms as in a whirlwind....\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ... there is a sweetness in my kisses as of a fruit\r\ndissolving within thy heart]\r\n\r\n(_Anthony makes the sign of the cross._)\r\n\r\n\"Thou disdainest me! farewell!\"\r\n\r\n(_She departs, weeping; then, suddenly turning round_:--)\r\n\r\n\"Art quite sure?--so beautiful a woman....\"\r\n\r\n(_She laughs, and the ape that bears her train, lifts it up._)\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt regret it, my comely hermit! thou wilt yet weep! thou wilt\r\nagain feel weary of thy life; but I care not a whit!

Therefore, for our salvation we must communicate with our\r\nbrethren--otherwise the Church, the assembly of the faithful, would\r\nbe a meaningless word--and we must listen to all reasoning, despising\r\nnothing, nor any person. The magician Balaam, the poet Aeschylus,\r\nand the Sybil of Cumæ--all foretold the Saviour. Dionysius, the\r\nAlexandrian, received from heaven the command to read all books.

We must believe the Scriptures!\"\r\n\r\nHILARION. \"Saint Paul, Origen, and many others did not understand\r\nthe Scriptures in a literal sense: yet if Holy Writ be explained by\r\nallegories it becomes the portion of a small number, and the evidence\r\nof the truth disappears.

The benches disappear under a host of\r\nspectators--knights, senators, soldiers, plebeians, vestals, and\r\ncourtesans--in woollen hoods, in silken maniples, in fallow-colored\r\ntunics; together with aigrettes of precious stones, plumes of feathers,\r\nthe fasces of lictors; and all this swarming multitude deafens and\r\nstupefies Anthony with its shoutings, its tumultuous fury, as of an\r\nenormous boiling vat. In the middle of the arena, a vase of incense\r\nsmokes upon an altar._\r\n\r\n_Anthony thus knows that the people with him are Christians condemned\r\nto be thrown to the wild beasts.

They will remain until it is all over._\r\n\r\n_Anthony notices among these consolers, a certain bald-headed man,\r\nin a black tunic: Anthony has seen that face somewhere before. The\r\nconsoler discourses to them concerning the nothingness of this world,\r\nand the felicity of the Elect.

From each branch of the colossal tree descend\r\nother branches which may bury themselves in the soil; and the aspect of\r\nall these horizontal and perpendicular lines, indefinitely multiplied,\r\nwould closely resemble a monstrous timber-work, were it not that they\r\nhave small figs[7] growing upon them here and there, and a blackish\r\nfoliage, like that of the sycamore._\r\n\r\n_He perceives in the forkings of their branches, hanging bunches of\r\nyellow flowers, violet flowers also, and ferns that resemble the plumes\r\nof splendid birds._\r\n\r\n_Under the lowest branches the horns of a bubalus gleam at intervals,\r\nand the bright eyes of antelopes are visible; there are hosts of\r\nparrots; there are butterflies flittering hither and thither; lizards\r\nlazily drag themselves up or down; flies buzz and hum; and in the midst\r\nof the silence, a sound is audible as of the palpitation of a deep and\r\nmighty life._\r\n\r\n_Seated upon a sort of pyre at the entrance of the wood is a strange\r\nbeing--a man--besmeared with cow-dung, completely naked, more withered\r\nthan a mummy; his articulations form knots at the termination of bones\r\nthat resemble sticks. He has bunches of shells suspended from his ears;\r\nhis face is very long, and his nose like a vulture's beak. His left arm\r\nremains motionlessly erect in air, anchylosed, rigid as a stake; and he\r\nhas been seated here so long that birds have made themselves a nest in\r\nhis long hair._\r\n\r\n_At the four corners of his wooden pyre flame four fires. The sun is\r\ndirectly in front of him. He gazes steadily at it with widely-opened\r\neyes; and, then without looking at Anthony, asks him_:--)\r\n\r\n\"Brahmin from the shores of the Nile, what hast thou to say regarding\r\nthese things?\"\r\n\r\n(_Flames suddenly burst out on all sides of him, through the intervals\r\nbetween the logs of the pyre; and_--)\r\n\r\nTHE GYMNOSOPHIST (_continues_).\r\n\r\n\"Lo! I have buried myself in solitude, like the rhinoceros. I dwelt in\r\nthe tree behind me.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I have buried myself in solitude, like the\r\nrhinoceros. I dwelt in the tree behind me.]\r\n\r\n(_The vast fig-tree, indeed, shows in one of its groves, a natural\r\nexcavation about the size of a man._)\r\n\r\n\"And I nourished me with flowers and fruits, observing the precepts so\r\nrigidly that not even a dog ever beheld me eat.\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as existence originates from corruption, corruption from\r\ndesire, desire from sensation, sensation from contact, I have ever\r\navoided all action, all contact, and perpetually--motionless as the\r\nstela of a tomb, exhaling my breath from my two nostrils, fixing my\r\neyes upon my nose, and contemplating the ether in my mind, the world in\r\nmy members, the moon in my heart--I dreamed of the essence of the great\r\nSoul whence continually escape the principles of life, even as sparks\r\nescape from fire.\r\n\r\n\"Thus at last I found the supreme Soul in all beings, and all beings\r\nin the supreme Soul; and I have been able to make mine own soul all my\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n\"I receive knowledge directly from heaven, like the bird Tchataka, who\r\nquenches his thirst from falling rain only.\r\n\r\n\"Even by so much as things are known to me, things no longer exist.\r\n\r\n\"For me now there is no more hope, no more anguish, there is neither\r\nhappiness nor virtue, nor day nor night, nor Thou nor I--absolutely\r\nnothing!\r\n\r\n\"My awful austerities have made me superior to the Powers. A single\r\ncontraction of my thought would suffice to kill a hundred sons of\r\nkings, to dethrone gods, to overturn the world.\"\r\n\r\n(_He utters all these things in a monotonous voice._\r\n\r\n_The surrounding leaves shrivel up. Fleeing rats rush over the ground._\r\n\r\n_He slowly turns his eyes downward toward the rising flames, and then\r\ncontinues_:--)\r\n\r\n\"I have loathed Form, I have loathed Perception, I have loathed even\r\nKnowledge itself, for the thought does not survive the transitory fact\r\nwhich caused it; and mind, like all else, is only an illusion.\r\n\r\n\"All that is engendered will perish; all that is dead must live again;\r\nthe beings that have even now disappeared shall sojourn again in wombs\r\nas yet unformed, and shall again return to earth to serve in woe other\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\n\"But inasmuch as I have rolled through the revolution of an indefinite\r\nmultitude of existences, under the envelopes of gods, of men, and of\r\nanimals, I renounce further wanderings; I will endure this weariness\r\nno more! I abandon the filthy hostelry of this body of mine, built\r\nwith flesh, reddened with blood, covered with a hideous skin, full of\r\nuncleanliness; and, for my recompense, I go at last to slumber in the\r\ndeepest deeps of the Absolute--in Annihilation.\"\r\n\r\n(_The flames rise to his chest, then envelope him. His head rises\r\nthrough them as through a hole in the wall.

He was here a moment ago. I saw him!\r\n\r\n\"What! No; it is impossible; I must have been mistaken!\r\n\r\n\"Yet why?... Perhaps my cabin, these stones, this sand, have no real\r\nexistence. I am becoming mad! Let me be calm! Where was I? What was it\r\nthat happened?\r\n\r\n\"Ah! the gymnosophist!... Such a death is frequent among the sages of\r\nIndia. Kalanos burned himself before Alexander; another did likewise\r\nin the time of Augustus. What hatred of life men must have to do thus!\r\nUnless, indeed, they are impelled by pride alone?... Yet in any event\r\nthey have the intrepidity of martyrs.... As for the latter, I can now\r\nwell believe what has been told me regarding the debauchery they cause.\r\n\r\n\"And before that? Yes: I remember now! the host of the Heresiarchs!\r\nWhat outcries! What eyes! Yet why so much rebellion of the flesh, so\r\nmuch dissoluteness, so many aberrations of the intellect.\r\n\r\n\"They claim, nevertheless, to seek God through all those ways! What\r\nright have I to curse them--I, who stumble so often in mine own path?\r\nI was perhaps about to learn more of them at the moment when they\r\ndisappeared. Too rapid was the whirl; I had no time to answer. Now I\r\nfeel as though there were more space, more light in my understanding. I\r\nam calm. I even feel myself able to.... What is this?

Gallop!\"\r\n\r\n(_Anthony watches him depart._\r\n\r\n_And as he gazes he beholds all the birds that nourish themselves\r\nwith wind: the Gouith, the Ahuti, the Alphalim, the Iukneth, of the\r\nmountains of Kaf, the homai of the Arabs--which are the souls of\r\nmurdered men. He hears the parrots that utter human speech; and the\r\ngreat Pelasgian palmipeds that sob like children or chuckle like old\r\nwomen._\r\n\r\n_A saline air strikes his nostrils. Now a vast beach stretches before\r\nhim._\r\n\r\n_In the distance jets of water arise, spouted by whales; and from the\r\nvery end of the horizon come_)--\r\n\r\nTHE BEASTS OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n(_round as wineskins, flat as blades, denticulated like saws, dragging\r\nthemselves over the sand as they approach_):\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The beasts of the sea round as wineskins ...]\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt accompany us to our immensities, whither as yet no one has\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\n\"Divers peoples inhabit the countries of the Ocean. Some dwell in the\r\nsojourn of tempests; others swim freely amid the transparency of chill\r\nwaves;--or, like oxen, graze upon the coral plains, or suck in through\r\ntheir trunks the reflux of the tides,--or bear upon their shoulders the\r\nvast weight of the sources of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Divers peoples inhabit the countries of the Ocean.]\r\n\r\n(_Phosphorences gleam in the moustaches of the seals, shift in the\r\nscales of fish. Echini whirl like wheels; ammonites uncoil like cables;\r\noysters make their shell hinges squeak; polypi unfold their tentacles;\r\nmedusæ quiver like balls of crystal suspended; sponges float hither and\r\nthither, anemones ejaculate water; wrack and sea-mosses have grown all\r\nabout._\r\n\r\n_And all sorts of plants extend themselves into branches, twist\r\nthemselves into screws, lengthen into points, round themselves out like\r\nfans.

(See\r\nBook II, chap. I, § 25.) Flaubert speaks of the Sphinx in the masculine\r\nlike Philemon. (See also Signor Carlo Fea's note upon the paragraph in\r\nWinkelmann, old French edition. An II, R.

The translator relegated\r\nthese to an addenda, which the publishers have omitted as being\r\nunnecessary.

Page 105 of original; page 108 translation. The realistic\r\nphraseology of the original passage is rather brutal.

Curious text of Crepitus, on page 228, pages 241-3 of original:\r\n\r\nCREPITUS\r\n\r\n(----se fait entendre):\r\n\r\n_Moi aussi l'on m'honora jadis. On me faisait des libations. Je fus un\r\nDieu!_\r\n\r\n_L'Athénien me saluait comme un presage de fortune, tandis que le\r\nRomain dévot me maudissait les poings levés et que le pontife d'Egypte,\r\ns'abstinant des fèves, tremblait à ma voix et pâlissait à mon odeur._\r\n\r\n_Quand le vinaigre militaire coulait sur les barbes non rasées, qu'on\r\nse régalait de glands, de pois, et d'oignons crus, et que le bouc en\r\nmorceau cuissait dans le beurre rance des pasteurs, sans souci du\r\nvoisin, personne alors ne se gênait. Les nourritures solides faisaient\r\ndigestions retentissantes. Au soleil de la campagne les hommes se\r\nsoulageaient avec lenteur._\r\n\r\n_Ainsi, je passais sans scandale, comme les autres besoins de la vie,\r\ncomme Mena, tourment des vierges, et la douce Rumina qui protège le\r\nsein de la nourrice, gonflé, des veines bleuâtres. J'étais joyeux. Je\r\nfaisais rire. Et se dilatant d'aise à cause de moi, le convive exhalait\r\ntoute sa gaieté par les ouvertures de son corps._\r\n\r\n_J'ai eu mes jours d'orgeuil. Le bon Aristophane me promena sur la\r\nscène, et l'empereur Claudius Drusus[1] me fit asseoir à sa table. Dans\r\nles laticlaves des patriciens j'ai circulé majestueusement! Les vases\r\nd'or, comme des tympanons, resonnaient sous moi; et, quand plein de\r\nmurènes, de truffles, et de pâtés, l'intestin du maître se dégageait\r\navec fracas, l'univers attentif apprenait que César avait diné!_\r\n\r\n_Mais à présent, je suis confiné dans la populace_[2] _et l'on se\r\nrécrie, même à mon nom!_\r\n\r\n_Et Crepitus s'éloigne, en poussant un gémissement...._\r\n\r\nE. For descriptions of the Martichoras and other monsters, appearing\r\npage 287 in the original and 263 in the translation, see also Rabelais'\r\nPantagruel, Book V, Chap. XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Needless to refer to the comedies of Aristophanes, with which\r\nEnglish readers have been familiarized through the Bohn translations.\r\nThe reference to Claudius ius Drusus seems based upon the following\r\nlines in Suetonius: \"_Dicitur etiam meditatus edictum, quo veniam daret\r\nflatum crepitumque ventris in convivio emittendi: cum periclitatum\r\nquemdam prae pudore ex continentia reperisset._\" (_Suetonius-Tiberius\r\nClaudius Drusus_: 32.)\r\n\r\n[2] The so-called divinities, _Deus Crepitus, Dea Pertunda, Deus\r\nStercutius, Dea Rumina_ (or _Rumilia_), _Dea Mena_, concerning whose\r\ncurious attributes the reader may consult English or French classical\r\nencyclopedists, were doubtless regarded by the intelligent classes\r\nof antiquity much as certain religious superstitions are regarded by\r\neducated moderns. It is true that they furnished grotesque themes\r\nto artists; but many existing superstitions regarding elves and\r\ngoblins have inspired modern sculptors, painters and designers.\r\nCertainly, seriously worshipped as deities, Priapus might seem equally\r\ncontemptible as a divinity; but his worship, degenerate as it became\r\nin later years, was primitively symbolical. The obscene image merely\r\ntypified the procreative Spirit of Nature. The eccentric gods and\r\ngoddesses above referred to had no such excuse for being. As previously\r\nobserved, however, Flaubert artistically represents these divinities\r\nnot as they were really considered in the antique world, but rather as\r\nthey would have appeared to the eyes of zealous Christians in the third\r\ncentury--infamous and loathsome.--Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nThis translation of the \"Tentation\" by Lafcadio Hearn, still regarded\r\nby many as the best up until now in English, still misses some small\r\nfragments (of a couple of words) not deemed fit for the Anglo-Saxon\r\ntemperament of that time. There is a contemporary version (2002) of\r\nthis translation available, with introduction by Michel Foucault and\r\nthe inclusion of some missing expressions.
