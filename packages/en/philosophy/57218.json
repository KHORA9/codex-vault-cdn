Its first part, ‘I am an Hebrew’, covers the more important\r\naspects of the life and consciousness of the Jew. The second, ‘The\r\nPeople of the Book’, deals with Israel’s religious contribution to\r\nmankind, and touches upon some epochal events in Israel’s story. In\r\nthe third, ‘The Testimony of the Nations’, will be found some striking\r\ntributes to Jews and Judaism from non-Jewish sources. The fourth part,\r\n‘The Voice of Prayer’, surveys the Sacred Occasions of the Jewish Year,\r\nand takes note of their echoes in the Liturgy. The fifth and concluding\r\npart, ‘The Voice of Wisdom’, is, in the main, a collection of the deep\r\nsayings of the Jewish sages on the ultimate problems of Life and the\r\nHereafter.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus from which this Jewish anthology gradually developed was\r\nproduced three years ago for the use of Jewish sailors and soldiers.\r\nTo many of them, I have been assured, it came as a re-discovery of the\r\nimperishable wealth of Israel’s heritage; while to the non-Jew into\r\nwhose hands it fell it was a striking revelation of Jewish ideals and\r\nteachings. I can pray for no better result for this enlarged Library\r\nEdition.\r\n\r\nGrateful acknowledgement is due to the authors, translators, and\r\npublishers, for their courteous permission to reprint selections\r\nfrom their works; to Dayan H.

Alone among the nations,\r\nIsrael has shared in all great movements since mankind became conscious\r\nof their destinies. If there is no Divine purpose in the long travail\r\nof Israel, it is vain to seek for any such purpose in man’s life. In\r\nthe reflected light of that purpose each Jew should lead his life with\r\nan added dignity.\r\n\r\n                                                  JOSEPH JACOBS, 1897.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEVERY Hebrew should look upon his Faith as a temple extending over\r\nevery land to prove the immutability of God and the unity of His\r\npurposes. He should regard himself as one of the pillars which support\r\nthat temple from falling to the ground; and add, however insignificant\r\nin itself, to the strength, the durability, and the beauty of the whole.\r\n\r\n                                                  GRACE AGUILAR, 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            I AM AN HEBREW\r\n\r\nI WILL continue to hold my banner aloft. I find myself born――ay,\r\nborn――into a people and a religion. The preservation of my people must\r\nbe for a purpose, for God does nothing without a purpose. His reasons\r\nare unfathomable to me, but on my own reason I place little dependence;\r\ntest it where I will it fails me. The simple, the ultimate in every\r\ndirection is sealed to me. It is as difficult to understand matter\r\nas mind. The courses of the planets are no harder to explain than the\r\ngrowth of a blade of grass. Therefore am I willing to remain a link\r\nin the great chain. What has been preserved for four thousand years\r\nwas not saved that I should overthrow it. My people have survived\r\nthe prehistoric paganism, the Babylonian polytheism, the aesthetic\r\nHellenism, the sagacious Romanism, at once the blandishments and\r\npersecutions of the Church; and it will survive the modern dilettantism\r\nand the current materialism, holding aloft the traditional Jewish\r\nideals inflexibly until the world shall become capable of recognizing\r\ntheir worth.\r\n\r\n                                                    CYRUS ADLER, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE GOOD FIGHT\r\n\r\nIF thou hadst lived in the dread days of martyrdom, and the peoples had\r\nfallen on thee to force thee to apostatize from thy faith, thou wouldst\r\nsurely, as did so many, have given thy life in its defence. Well then,\r\nfight now the fight laid on thee in the better days, the fight with\r\nevil desire; fight and conquer, and seek for allies in this warfare\r\nof your soul, seek them in the fear of God and the study of the Law.\r\nForget not that God recompenses according to the measure wherewith ye\r\nwithstand the evil in your heart.

Thou\r\nhast need of Him, but He needs thee not. Put no trust in thy mere\r\ncorporeal well-being here below. Many a one has lain down to sleep at\r\nnightfall, but at morn has not risen again. Fear the Lord, the God of\r\nthy fathers; fail never at eventide to pronounce the great word wherein\r\nIsrael is wont to proclaim that He is, and that He is One, and One only;\r\nat dawn fail never to read the appointed prayer. See that thou guard\r\nwell thy soul’s holiness; let the thought of thy heart be saintly, and\r\nprofane not thy soul with words of impurity.\r\n\r\nVisit the sick and suffering man, and let thy countenance be cheerful\r\nwhen he sees it, but not so that thou oppress the helpless one with\r\ngaiety. Comfort those that are in grief; let piety where thou seest it\r\naffect thee even to tears; and then it may be that thou wilt be spared\r\nthe grief of weeping over the death of thy children.\r\n\r\nRespect the poor man by gifts whose hand he knows not of; be not deaf\r\nto his beseechings, deal not hard words out to him, and give him of thy\r\nrichest food when he sits at meat with thee.\r\n\r\nFrom a wicked neighbour, see that thou keep aloof, and spend not much\r\nof thy time among the people who speak ill of their brother-man; be not\r\nas the fly that is always seeking sick and wounded places; and tell not\r\nof the faults and failings of those about thee.\r\n\r\nTake no one to wife unworthy to be thy life’s partner, and keep thy\r\nsons close to the study of Divine things. Dare not to rejoice when\r\nthine enemy comes to the ground; but give him food when he hungers.\r\nBe on thy guard lest thou give pain ever to the widow and the orphan;\r\nand beware lest thou ever set thyself up to be both witness and judge\r\nagainst an other.\r\n\r\nNever enter thy house with abrupt and startling step, and bear not\r\nthyself so that those who dwell under thy roof shall dread when in thy\r\npresence. Purge thy soul of angry passion, that inheritance of fools;\r\nlove wise men, and strive to know more and more of the works and the\r\nways of the Creator.\r\n\r\n                                              ELIEZER BEN ISAAC, 1050.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nBE not ready to quarrel; avoid oaths and passionate adjurations,\r\nexcess of laughter and outbursts of wrath; they disturb and confound\r\nthe reason of man. Avoid all dealings wherein there is a lie; utter not\r\nthe name of God superfluously, or in places dirty or defiled.\r\n\r\nCut from under thee all mere human supports, and make not gold the\r\nforemost longing of thy life; for that is the first step to idolatry.\r\nRather give money than words; and as to ill words, see that thou place\r\nthem in the scale of understanding before they leave thy lips.\r\n\r\nWhat has been uttered in thy presence, even though not told as secret,\r\nlet it not pass from thee to others. And if one tell thee a tale, say\r\nnot to him that thou hast heard it all before. Do not fix thine eyes\r\ntoo much on one who is far above thee in wealth, but on those who are\r\nbehind thee in worldly fortune.\r\n\r\nPut no one to open shame; misuse not thy power against any one; who can\r\ntell whether thou wilt not some day be powerless thyself?\r\n\r\nDo not struggle vaingloriously for the small triumph of showing thyself\r\nin the right and a wise man in the wrong; thou art not one whit the\r\nwiser therefor. Be not angry or unkind to any one for trifles, lest\r\nthou make thyself enemies unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nDo not refuse things out of mere obstinacy to thy fellow-citizens,\r\nrather put thy will below their wishes. Avoid, as much as may be, bad\r\nmen, men of persistent angry feelings, fools; thou canst get nothing\r\nfrom their company but shame. Be the first to extend courteous greeting\r\nto every one, whatever be his faith; provoke not to wrath one of\r\nanother belief than thine.\r\n\r\n                                              ASHER BEN YECHIEL, 1300.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN THE OLD GHETTO\r\n\r\nIN the narrow lanes and by-ways of the old Jewish quarter of many a\r\nEuropean town there grew up that beautiful Jewish home-life which,\r\nthough its story is seldom recorded, is more important than the outer\r\nevents and misfortunes that historians have made note of. And as we\r\nlook upon the unsightly houses, the wretched exterior seems to float\r\naway and the home-scenes of joy and love and religious constancy shine\r\nbrilliantly forth――perpetual lamps――and explain how, in spite of woe\r\nand misery such as have fallen to the lot of no other people, the Jews\r\nhave found strength to live and hope on.\r\n\r\n                                                   D.

It was\r\nrather the ensuing demoralization of home life. This is proved――it\r\ncannot be repeated too often――by the Jews; for they suffered more\r\nseverely and more cruelly by wars than any other nation; but, among\r\nthem, the inmost living germ of morality――strict discipline and family\r\ndevotion――was at all times preserved. This wonderful and mysterious\r\npreservation of the Jewish people is due to the Jewish woman. This\r\nis her glory, not alone in the history of her own people, but in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\n                                                           M.

She is the inspirer of a pure, chaste,\r\nfamily life whose hallowing influences are incalculable; she is the\r\ncentre of all spiritual endeavours, the confidante and fosterer of\r\nevery undertaking. To her the Talmudic sentence applies: ‘It is woman\r\nalone through whom God’s blessings are vouchsafed to a house’.\r\n\r\n                                                HENRIETTA SZOLD, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          YIDDISH CRADLE SONG\r\n\r\n          O!

Life is so much the poorer for being shorn of the halo of high\r\nspiritual aspiration. Instead of a fixed and lofty ideal of life and\r\nconduct, based on the highest conception of Divine Perfection of which\r\nthe human mind is capable, there prevails a limited and _fluctuating_\r\nideal, subject to the chance influences of surroundings and associates,\r\nand coloured by the social grade and worldly interests of each\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n                                                 JULIA M.

In the Synagogue we meet as Jews, there in prayer,\r\nin aspiration, in confession of faith, to carry on the stream of\r\nspiritual effort which has flowed unbroken through the ages ever since\r\nIsrael became conscious of himself. Therefore the prayers will not\r\nmerely voice private needs and modern ideas, but will chiefly speak\r\nof Israel. And so they will largely be in Hebrew, Israel’s historic\r\nlanguage. You may get rid of Hebrew, but with it you will get rid\r\nof the Synagogue too, of the Synagogue as a living organism, as the\r\nwell-spring of Jewish feeling and the inspiration of Jewish life. Nor\r\nis this all. The claim of Hebrew, though bound up with the interests of\r\npublic worship, yet transcends them. It will meet you whenever you open\r\nyour Jewish history, whenever you open your Bible. As long as we remain\r\nJews and call the Bible our own, the Tongue in which it is written must\r\nbe inestimably sacred to us.\r\n\r\n                                                  MORRIS JOSEPH, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE HEBREW LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nTHE Hebrew language is the great depository of all that is best in\r\nthe soul-life of the Congregation of Israel. Without it we will become\r\nsevered from the great Tree which is life unto those that cling to it.\r\nHellenistic Judaism[2] is the only one known to history which dared to\r\nmake this experiment of dispensing with the Sacred Language. The result\r\nwas death. It withered away and terminated in total and wholesale\r\napostasy from Judaism. Let us not deceive ourselves. There is no future\r\nin this country for a Judaism that resists either the English or the\r\nHebrew language.\r\n\r\n                                                   S.

Have we a right to throw the key\r\ninto the ocean of oblivion? More than that: when we have ceased to be\r\nefficient guardians of our treasures, of what use are we in the world?\r\nI fear that in the case of such flagrant dereliction of duty, the\r\ntwentieth century will have in store for us not a Ghetto, but a grave.\r\n\r\n                                                HENRIETTA SZOLD, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WHAT IS CULTURE?\r\n\r\nNOT what a man has――knowledge, skill, or goods of life――determines\r\nhis culture, but what a man _is_: culture is not so much mastery of\r\nthings as mastery of self. And only that nation can be called cultured\r\nwhich adds to or, at least, broadens and deepens the spiritual assets\r\nof mankind; which introduces some distinctive note into the soul-life\r\nof the world; which teaches humanity a new angle of vision towards the\r\nInfinite; and by its living and, if need be, by its dying, vindicates\r\nthe eternal values of life――conscience, honour, liberty.\r\n\r\nJudged by this test, some of the littlest of peoples――Judea, Greece,\r\nElizabethan England――stand foremost among cultured nations, champions\r\nof the sacred heritage of man. Judged by this test, many a poor Jew,\r\nthough he be devoid of the graces, amenities, and comforts of life, is\r\nyet possessed of culture. An ancient language, a classical language, a\r\nholy language, is as familiar to him as his mother-tongue; saturated is\r\nhe with the sublimest of literatures, which hallows his life and endows\r\nhim with high faith and invincible courage.\r\n\r\nSympathetic appreciation of this indomitable type, this harmonious\r\nalbeit rugged personality, might well be taken as a touchstone of a\r\nman’s mentality, culture, and humanity.\r\n\r\n                                                    J.

He mentions the profession\r\nfor which he is preparing himself, and through which he will obtain a\r\nlucrative office or a comfortable position in life.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely different with those who expended their time and powers\r\non the study of the Talmud. They wished to derive no profit from their\r\nstudies; not to use them, as a Mishna teacher says, ‘as a spade to dig\r\nwherewith nor as a crown wherewith to aggrandise oneself’. ‘Say not’,\r\nexclaims the Talmud, ‘I will study the Torah in order that people may\r\ncall me Sage or Master, but study from pure love to God, to cleave more\r\nclosely unto Him through the knowledge and understanding of His word.’\r\nDay and night did they bury themselves in the study of subjects that\r\nhad nothing to do with social life or with gain; often they became\r\nengrossed in the investigation of laws of sacrifices and purification,\r\nalthough these had long since grown obsolete. They desired nothing\r\nbut knowledge, understanding, illumination. Where is there another\r\npeople on earth among whom studies which aimed only at truth and the\r\ndevelopment of the spiritual life were cultivated with such pure,\r\ndevoted, and selfless love as in Israel?\r\n\r\n                                                    A.

Teach me the\r\nway of Thy statutes, that I may obey them, and faithfully carry out Thy\r\nordinances. Dispose my heart to love Thee and to fear Thy holy name,\r\nand grant me Thy support and the strength necessary to avoid the\r\nworldly dangers which encompass the path lying before me. Save me from\r\ntemptation, so that I may with fortitude observe Thy holy Law and those\r\nprecepts on which human happiness and eternal life depend. Thus I will\r\nevery day of my life trustfully and gladly proclaim: ‘Hear, O Israel,\r\nthe Lord is our God, the Lord is one!’\r\n\r\n                                                 BENJAMIN ARTOM, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ON THE THRESHOLD OF MANHOOD\r\n\r\n      MY son, keep the commandment of thy father,\r\n      And forsake not the teaching of thy mother.\r\n      Bind them continually upon thy heart,\r\n      Tie them about thy neck.\r\n      When thou walkest, it shall lead thee;\r\n      When thou liest down, it shall watch over thee;\r\n      And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.\r\n      For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light,\r\n      And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:\r\n      To keep thee from the evil woman.\r\n\r\n                                              PROVERBS 6. 20‒4.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRABBI Hanina[5], son of Dosa, said: ‘He in whom the fear of sin comes\r\nbefore wisdom, his wisdom shall endure; but he in whom wisdom comes\r\nbefore the fear of sin, his wisdom will not endure.’\r\n\r\nRabbi Eleazar[6], son of Azaryah, said: ‘He whose wisdom exceeds\r\nhis works, to what is he like?

The perfection of the body is a necessary antecedent to\r\nthe perfection of the soul, for health is the key to the inner chamber.\r\nMeasure thy words, for by multiplying words thou increasest error. If\r\nthou find in the Law or the Prophets or the Sages a hard saying which\r\nthou canst not understand, stand fast by thy faith and attribute the\r\nfault to thine own want of intelligence. Place it in a corner of your\r\nheart for future consideration, but despise not thy religion because\r\nthou art unable to understand one difficult matter.\r\n\r\nLove truth and uprightness――the ornaments of the soul――and cleave\r\nunto them; prosperity so obtained is built on a sure rock. Keep firmly\r\nto thy word; let not a legal contract or witnesses be more binding\r\nthan thine verbal promise whether in public or in private. Disdain\r\nreservations and subterfuges, evasions and sharp practices. Woe to him\r\nwho builds his house upon them. Abhor inactivity and indolence, the\r\ncauses of destruction of body, of penury, of self-contempt――the ladders\r\nof Satan and his satellites.\r\n\r\nDefile not your souls by quarrelsomeness and petulance. I have seen\r\nthe white become black, the low brought still lower, families driven\r\ninto exile, princes deposed from their high estate, great cities laid\r\nin ruins, assemblies dispersed, the pious humiliated, the honourable\r\nheld lightly and despised, all on account of quarrelsomeness. Glory in\r\nforbearance, for in that is true strength and victory.\r\n\r\n                                                     MOSES MAIMONIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WHAT MAKES A MAN A JEW?\r\n\r\nJUDAISM is something more than a badge, something more than a\r\nbirth-mark; it is a life. To be born a Jew does not declare any of\r\nus to be of the elect; it only designates us for enrolment among the\r\nelect. God signs the covenant, but we have to seal it――to seal it by a\r\nlife of service. ‘What makes a man a Jew?’ is a question that is often\r\nasked. The answer is, two things: membership of the Jewish brotherhood,\r\nand loyal fulfilment of the obligations which that membership imposes.\r\nTo be of the Jewish race but to trample upon Jewish duty is to be\r\nfaithless to Israel.\r\n\r\n                                                  MORRIS JOSEPH, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ‘I BELIEVE’\r\n\r\nI BELIEVE in God, the One and Holy, the Creator and Sustainer of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI believe that man possesses a Divine power wherewith he may subdue\r\nhis evil impulses and passions, strive to come nearer and nearer the\r\nperfection of God, and commune with Him in prayer.\r\n\r\nI believe that select individuals are, from time to time, called by God\r\nas prophets and charged with the mission of declaring His will unto men.\r\n\r\nI believe that man is subject to God’s law and responsible to the\r\nSearcher of the human heart and the Righteous Judge for all his\r\nthoughts and deeds.\r\n\r\nI believe that he who confesses his sins and turns from his evil\r\nways and truly repents is lovingly forgiven by his Father in Heaven.\r\n\r\nI believe that the pious who obey God’s law and do His will with a\r\nperfect heart, and those who truly repent, share, as immortal souls,\r\nin the everlasting life of God.\r\n\r\nI believe that Israel was chosen by God as His anointed servant to\r\nproclaim unto the families of mankind His truth; and, though despised\r\nand rejected by men, to continue as His witness until there come in\r\nthrough him the Kingdom of Peace and moral perfection, and the fullness\r\nof the knowledge of God, the true Community of the Children of the\r\nliving God.\r\n\r\n                                                 M.

MARGOLIS, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      JUDAISM A POSITIVE RELIGION\r\n\r\nSATISFYING the needs of anybody and everybody, of every moment and\r\nevery fleeting season, is not the highest ideal which Judaism set\r\nbefore itself. Altogether I venture to think that the now fashionable\r\ntest of determining the worth of a religion by its capability to supply\r\nthe various demands of the great market of believers has something\r\nlow and mercenary about it. True religion is not a jack-of-all-trades,\r\nmeaning Monotheism to the philosopher, Pluralism to the crowd, some\r\nmysterious Nothing to the agnostic, Pantheism to the poet, and Service\r\nof Man to the hero-worshipper. Its mission is just as much to teach\r\nthe world that there _are_ false gods and false ideals as to bring it\r\nnearer to the true one. Abraham, the friend of God, who was destined\r\nto become the first winner of souls, began his career, according to\r\nthe legend, with breaking idols, and it is his particular glory to have\r\nbeen in opposition to the whole world. Judaism means to convert the\r\nworld, not to convert itself. It will not die in order _not_ to live.\r\nIt disdains a victory by defeating itself, in giving up its essential\r\ndoctrines, its most sacred symbols, its most precious traditions, and\r\nits most vital teaching. It has confidence in the world; it hopes and\r\nprays and waits patiently for the Great Day when the world will be ripe\r\nfor its acceptance.\r\n\r\n                                                   S.

This rite symbolizes the mission of Israel to the world:\r\nWith the Law of God folded in his arms and its words engraved upon his\r\nheart, he has gone up and down the earth proclaiming his belief in the\r\nOne Supreme Being――a Being whose spirit fills all time and all space,\r\na Being never embodied, but made manifest to man in the glory of the\r\ncreation and in His all-wise behests, which teach mercy, love, and\r\njustice....\r\n\r\n                                                  HERMANN ADLER, 1895.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA CLEAR and concise definition of Judaism[7] is very difficult to\r\ngive, for the reason that it is not a religion pure and simple based\r\nupon accepted creeds, but is one inseparably connected with the Jewish\r\nnation as the depositary and guardian of the truths held by it for\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nFar from having become 1,900 years ago a stagnant religion, Judaism\r\nhas ever remained ‘a river of God full of living waters’, which, while\r\nrunning within the river-bed of a single nation, has continued to feed\r\nanew the great streams of human civilization.\r\n\r\n                                                      K.

The duty to proselytize springs clearly from the\r\nidea that outside a certain belief there is no salvation. I, as a Jew,\r\nam not bound to accept that dogma, because, according to the teachings\r\nof the Rabbis, _the righteous of all nations shall have part in the\r\nrewards of the future world_. Your motive, therefore, is foreign to me;\r\nnay, as a Jew, I am not allowed publicly to attack any religion which\r\nis sound in its moral teachings.\r\n\r\n                                          MOSES MENDELSSOHN, 1770.\r\n                                      _To a non-Jewish correspondent._\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI AM the creature of God, and so is my fellow-man; my calling is in\r\nthe town, and his in the fields; I go early to my work, and he to his;\r\nhe does not boast of his labour nor I of mine, and if thou wouldst say,\r\n‘I accomplish great things and he little things’, we have learnt that\r\n_whether a man accomplish great things or small, his reward is the same\r\nif only his heart be set upon Heaven_.\r\n\r\n                                                               TALMUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OUR HERITAGE\r\n\r\nOUR laws have been such as have always inspired admiration and\r\nimitation in all other men.\r\n\r\nNay, farther, multitudes of mankind have had a great inclination of\r\na long time to follow our religious observances; for there is not\r\nany city of the Grecians, nor any of the barbarians, nor any nation\r\nwhatsoever, whither our custom of resting on the seventh day hath not\r\ncome, and by which our fasts and lighting up lamps, and many of our\r\nprohibitions as to our food, are not observed;[8] they also endeavour\r\nto imitate our mutual concord with one another, and the charitable\r\ndistribution of our goods, and our diligence in our trades, and our\r\nfortitude in undergoing distresses on account of our laws. And what\r\nis here matter of the greatest admiration, our Law hath no bait of\r\npleasure to allure men to it, but it prevails by its own force; and as\r\nGod himself pervades all the world, so hath our Law passed through all\r\nthe world also.\r\n\r\nAs to the laws themselves more words are unnecessary, for they are\r\nvisible in their own nature, and appear to teach not impiety, but the\r\ntruest piety in the world. They are enemies to injustice; they banish\r\nidleness and luxurious living; and they instruct men to be content with\r\nwhat they have, and to be laborious in their calling. They forbid men\r\nto make war from a desire of getting more, but make men courageous in\r\ndefending the laws. On which account I am so bold as to say that we are\r\nbecome the teachers of other men in the greatest number of things, and\r\nthose of the most excellent nature only; for what is more excellent\r\nthan inviolable piety? What is more just than submission to laws, and\r\nmore advantageous than mutual love and concord? And this so far that\r\nwe are to be neither divided by calamities, nor to become injurious and\r\nseditious in prosperity; but to contemn death when we are in war, and\r\nin peace to apply ourselves to our handicrafts, or to our tillage of\r\nthe ground; while we in all things and in all ways are satisfied that\r\nGod is the Judge and Governor of our actions.\r\n\r\n                                           FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS, 1st cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OUR FATHERS\r\n\r\n        LET us now praise famous men,\r\n        Our fathers in their generations.\r\n        The Lord manifested in them great glory,\r\n        Even His mighty power from the beginning.\r\n        Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms,\r\n        And were men renowned for their power,\r\n        Giving counsel by their understanding,\r\n        Such as have brought tidings in prophecies:\r\n        Leaders of the people by their counsels,\r\n        And by their understanding men of learning for the people;\r\n        Wise were their words in their instruction:\r\n        Such as sought out musical tunes,\r\n        And set forth verses in writing:\r\n        Rich men furnished with ability,\r\n        Living peaceably in their habitations:\r\n        All these were honoured in their generations,\r\n        And were a glory in their days.\r\n        There be of them, that have left a name behind them,\r\n        To declare their praises.\r\n        And some there be, which have no memorial;\r\n        Who are perished as though they had not been,\r\n        And are become as though they had not been born,\r\n        And their children after them.\r\n        But these were men of mercy,\r\n        Whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten.\r\n        With their seed shall remain continually a good inheritance;\r\n        Their children are within the covenants.\r\n        Their seed standeth fast,\r\n        And their children for their sakes.\r\n        Their seed shall remain for ever,\r\n        And their glory shall not be blotted out.\r\n        Their bodies are buried in peace,\r\n        And their name liveth for evermore.\r\n        Peoples will declare their wisdom,\r\n        And the congregation telleth out their praise.\r\n\r\n                                      ECCLESIASTICUS 44. 1‒15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE OBLIGATIONS OF HEREDITY\r\n\r\nJEWISH history admonishes the Jews: ‘_Noblesse oblige_’.

Now the world inverts the distribution. Our\r\nvirtues it credits to us, to our individual brilliancy, diligence,\r\ncourage. Whereas the crimes, vices, and failings of any single Jew, no\r\nmatter how estranged from his people or his people’s faith he may be,\r\nit puts down to his Jewishness, and fathers them upon the entire Jewish\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIs it not a matter of sacred honour, as far as in us lies to counteract\r\nthe world’s injustice to our people by rendering, when the opportunity\r\nis ours, some repayment for all we owe to Israel?\r\n\r\n                                                    J. H. HERTZ, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ZEDAKAH[9]――CHARITY\r\n\r\n                            TUR, II, § 247\r\n\r\nTHE dispensing of charity according to one’s means is a positive\r\nprecept, which demands greater care and diligence in its fulfilment\r\nthan all the other positive precepts of the Law. For its neglect may\r\npossibly lead to the taking of life, inasmuch as the denial of timely\r\naid may compass the death of the poor man who needs our immediate help.\r\n\r\nWhoso closes his eyes to this duty and hardens his heart to his needy\r\nbrother is called a worthless man, and is regarded as an idolater. But\r\nwhosoever is careful in the fulfilment of this duty attests himself\r\nas belonging to the seed of Abraham, whom the Lord hath blessed: ‘For\r\nI have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his\r\nhousehold after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do\r\n_Zedakah_ and justice’ (Genesis 18. 19).\r\n\r\nCharity is the main foundation of Israel’s pre-eminence, and the basis\r\nof the Law of Truth. As the prophet says unto Zion: ‘By _Zedakah_ shalt\r\nthou be established’ (Isaiah 54. 14). Its practice will alone bring\r\nabout Israel’s redemption: ‘Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and\r\nthey that return of her with _Zedakah_’ (Isaiah 1. 27). Charity is\r\ngreater than all sacrifices, says Rabbi Eleazar; even as it is written,\r\n‘To do _Zedakah_ and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than\r\nsacrifice’ (Proverbs 21. 3).\r\n\r\nWhoso pities the poor shall himself receive compassion from the Holy\r\nOne, blessed be He. Let man further reflect that as there is a wheel of\r\nfortune revolving in this world, perchance some day either he himself,\r\nor his son, or his son’s son, may be brought down to the same lowly\r\nstate. Nor let it enter his mind to say: ‘How can I give to the poor\r\nand thus lessen my possessions?’ For man must know that he is not the\r\nmaster of what he has, but only the guardian, to carry out the will of\r\nHim who entrusted these things to his keeping.\r\n\r\nWhosoever withholds alms from the needy thereby withdraws himself from\r\nthe lustre of the Shechinah and the light of the Law.\r\n\r\nLet man therefore be exceedingly diligent in the right bestowal of\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n                                                JACOB BEN ASHER, 1320.\r\n                                                (_Trans.

Sympathy and compassion are emotions that\r\nhave their proper place and use, but even these noble feelings must be\r\nsilenced in the presence of Justice. In this Scriptural command there\r\nis a height of conception, a sublimity of moral view, which compels the\r\nreverence of all.\r\n\r\n                                                      A.

They were not satisfied with feeding the poor. Their\r\ngreat ideal was not to allow a man to be poor, not to allow him to\r\ncome down into the depths of poverty. They say, ‘Try to prevent it by\r\nteaching him a trade. Try all methods before you permit him to become\r\nan object of charity, which must degrade him, tender as your dealings\r\nwith him may be.’\r\n\r\n                                                   S.

He has a rooted\r\nnotion that he is the best, the only judge, of what is good for you\r\nto do for him. And the fact is that these self-confident recipients of\r\nyour generosity really are often your betters in many qualifications.\r\nLarge-mindedness is needed here. We must respect old habits; we must\r\nfathom the deep moral springs of life. We must beware that our brothers\r\ndo not divest themselves of their best, and assume our worst.\r\n\r\n                                                    I.

The sacred scroll of the Law is\r\nenshrined at their left, and behind them we see ponderous old tomes,\r\ntight fitted into the alcove of a vault-like chamber, with quaint\r\ncurves and angles. Is not this some souvenir from the brush of an old\r\nmaster? No, it is a group of inmates of the ‘Old People’s Rest’ at\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes one most about the inmates is the refinement and\r\nintellectuality of their features. It is a workhouse where aged\r\nfailures in the struggle for existence are permitted to pass away\r\nin peace. Not here will we meet with degraded types of the European\r\ninebriate or jailbird. They are all representative of one very\r\nfascinating aspect of Judaism which it is the fashion to doubt or decry.\r\nIt is not only in India that the Yogi, or contemplative Sage, is to be\r\nmet with, who, having fulfilled his whole duty as a man, retires from\r\nactive life to meditate on the here and the hereafter. We have our\r\nJewish Yogis even outside the dazzling effulgence which emanates from\r\nthe Zohar. They work not, neither do they spin, but the world is better\r\nfor their being in it, even if not of it. It is refreshing to think\r\nthat not everybody is in a hurry, not everybody busy money-making or\r\nmoney-spending, and that a few there are who are survivals of more\r\ntranquil ages.\r\n\r\n                                                    E.

Moses,\r\nour Teacher, always bore his share in the troubles of the congregation,\r\nas it is written, ‘They took a stone and put it under him’ (Exodus 17.\r\n12). Could they not have given him a chair or a cushion? But then he\r\nsaid, ‘Since the Israelites are in trouble, lo, I will bear my part\r\nwith them, for he who bears his portion of the burden will live to\r\nenjoy the hour of consolation’. Woe to one who thinks, ‘Ah, well, I\r\nwill neglect my duty. Who can know whether I bear my part or not?’\r\nEven the stones of the house, ay, the limbs of the trees shall testify\r\nagainst him, as it is written, ‘For the stones will cry from the wall,\r\nand the limbs of the trees will testify’.\r\n\r\n                                                               TALMUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                II[10]\r\n\r\n‘IT is high time’, wrote Leopold Zunz, in the days when the\r\nemancipation of the Jews in Europe was being constantly postponed, or\r\nwas being dealt with in a huckstering and grudging spirit, ‘It is high\r\ntime that instead of having rights and liberties doled out to them,\r\nthey should obtain Right and Liberty.’ It was well said: ‘Right and\r\nLiberty’ are one and indivisible, and belong to all men as such. Well,\r\n‘Right and Liberty’ are ours, if any people on the face of the earth\r\ncan be said to possess them. Surely we owe something to the land and\r\nthe people where and among whom our lines are fallen, and of which\r\nwe are an integral part. We owe it to them to take our share of the\r\nnational burdens and in the national life, to seek our prosperity in\r\ntheirs, to respect the law and its representatives, from the humblest\r\nofficer of justice to the Sovereign upon the throne.\r\n\r\n                                                  SIMEON SINGER, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE DUTY OF SELF-RESPECT\r\n\r\nNOTHING is more dangerous for a nation or for an individual than\r\nto plead guilty to imaginary sins. Where the sin is real――by honest\r\nendeavour the sinner can purify himself. But when a man has been\r\npersuaded to suspect himself unjustly――what _can_ he do? Our greatest\r\nneed is emancipation from self-contempt, from this idea that we are\r\nreally worse than all the world. Otherwise we may in course of time\r\nbecome in reality what we now imagine ourselves to be.\r\n\r\n                                                    ACHAD HA’AM, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ANTI-SEMITISM\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nJEWISH misery has two forms, the material and the moral. In Eastern\r\nEurope, in those regions which shelter the vast majority of our race,\r\nwe see a painful fight for the maintenance of a bare existence. In\r\nWestern Europe, the Jew has bread; but man does not live on bread alone.\r\nHis misery is moral. It exists in the constant wounding of self-respect\r\nand honour.\r\n\r\n                                                     MAX NORDAU, 1897.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI REMEMBER when I used to come home from the Cheder[11], bleeding and\r\ncrying from the wounds inflicted upon me by the Christian boys, my\r\nfather used to say, ‘My child, we are in Golus (exile), and we must\r\nsubmit to God’s will’. And he made me understand that this is only\r\na passing stage in history, as we Jews belong to Eternity, when God\r\nwill comfort His people. Thus the pain was only physical; but my\r\nreal suffering began later in life, when I emigrated from Roumania to\r\nso-called civilized countries, and found there what I might call the\r\nHigher Anti-Semitism, which burns the soul though it leaves the body\r\nunhurt.\r\n\r\n                                                   S.

He forgets, however, that the\r\nanti-Semitic accusations are valueless, because they are not based on\r\na criticism of real facts, but are merely due to the psychological law\r\naccording to which children, savages, and malevolent fools make persons\r\nand things against which they have an aversion responsible for their\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\nPretexts change, but the hatred remains. The Jews are not hated because\r\nthey have evil qualities; evil qualities are sought for in them because\r\nthey are hated.\r\n\r\n                                                           MAX NORDAU.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMY grandmother, the beautiful daughter of a family who had suffered\r\nmuch from persecution, had imbibed that dislike for her race which\r\nthe vain are too apt to adopt when they find they are born to public\r\ncontempt. The indignant feeling that should be reserved for the\r\npersecutor, in the mortification of their disturbed sensibility,\r\nis too often visited on the victim; and the cause of annoyance is\r\nrecognized not in the ignorant malevolence of the powerful, but in the\r\nconscientious conviction of the innocent sufferer.\r\n\r\n                                              BENJAMIN DISRAELI, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nANTI-SEMITES accuse the Jewish people of an incapacity for forgiveness\r\nand love.

One of the\r\nmasterpieces of eloquence bequeathed to us by classic antiquity is the\r\nfuneral oration delivered by Pericles on those who had fallen in the\r\nPeloponnesian War. He dilates upon the sources of Athens’ greatness.\r\nHe portrays in glowing colours how justice is there equally meted out\r\nto all citizens, from the highest to the lowest, how all are under the\r\naegis of freedom, and all equally inspired by obedience to law. And he\r\ncontinues: ‘Such a country well deserves that her children should die\r\nfor her!’ The members of the House of Israel have always faithfully\r\nserved the country of their birth or their adoption. But surely England\r\ndeserves that we, her Jewish children, should gladly live and die for\r\nher: since here, as in no other country, the teachings of Holy Writ are\r\nvenerated and obeyed.

And here it is still able, by the loftiness\r\nof its ethical truth and by the purity of its principles, to give\r\nintellectual and moral stamina to a never-ending future humanity.\r\n\r\n                                                   M.

In anticipation of\r\nit, the children of men were bidden to write the story of man on tables\r\nof clay, as such tables would not only escape destruction, but would\r\nbecome the more enduring. We to-day are the eyewitnesses of such a\r\nfire-deluge dreamt of by the ancients. Let us not, however, fear that\r\ncivilization and religion will perish from the earth. Quite other\r\nwill be its far-reaching results for mankind. Right and humanity will\r\nemerge stronger than ever from this world-conflagration. Before this\r\nwar we saw that the laws of God and man were written as it were on\r\nmere tables of clay, breakable and effaceable at will. This very\r\nworld-conflagration, however, will yet render the Law of Nations\r\nindestructible and for ever unassailable by insolence or power.

RASKIN, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE SECRET OF ISRAEL’S IMMORTALITY[14]\r\n\r\nWHAT has prevented this constantly migrating people, this veritable\r\nWandering Jew, from degenerating into brutalized vagabonds, into\r\nvagrant hordes of gipsies? The answer is at hand. In its journey\r\nthrough the desert of life, for eighteen centuries, the Jewish people\r\ncarried along the Ark of the Covenant, which breathed into its heart\r\nideal aspirations, and even illumined the badge of disgrace affixed\r\nto its garment with an apostolic glory. The proscribed, outlawed,\r\nuniversally persecuted Jew felt a sublime, noble pride in being\r\nsingled out to perpetuate and to suffer for a religion which reflects\r\neternity, by which the nations of the earth were gradually educated\r\nto a knowledge of God and morality, and from which is to spring the\r\nsalvation and redemption of the world.\r\n\r\nSuch a people, which disdains its present but has the eye steadily\r\nfixed on its future, which lives as it were on hope, is on that very\r\naccount eternal, like hope.\r\n\r\n                                                      H. GRAETZ, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE BOOK OF BOOKS\r\n\r\nTHE Bible, what a book! Large and wide as the world, based on\r\nthe abysses of creation, and towering aloft into the blue secrets\r\nof heaven. Sunrise and sunset, promise and fulfilment, birth and\r\ndeath――the whole drama of humanity――are contained in this one book. It\r\nis the Book of Books. The Jews may readily be consoled at the loss of\r\nJerusalem, and the Temple, and the Ark of the Covenant, and all the\r\ncrown jewels of King Solomon. Such forfeiture is as naught when weighed\r\nagainst the Bible, the imperishable treasure that they have saved. If I\r\ndo not err, it was Mahomet who named the Jews the ‘People of the Book’,\r\na name which in Eastern countries has remained theirs to the present\r\nday, and is deeply significant. That one book is to the Jews their\r\ncountry. Within the well-fenced boundaries of that book they live and\r\nhave their being; they enjoy their inalienable citizenship, are strong\r\nto admiration; thence none can dislodge them. Absorbed in the perusal\r\nof their sacred book they little heeded the changes that were wrought\r\nin the real world around them. Nations rose and vanished, States\r\nflourished and decayed, revolutions raged throughout the earth――but\r\nthey, the Jews, sat poring over this book, unconscious of the wild\r\nchase of time that rushed on above their heads.\r\n\r\n                                                       H.

Its vision of\r\nlife moulds states and societies. Its Psalms are more popular in every\r\ncountry than the poems of the nation’s own poets.

We have stormed heaven to snatch down\r\nthis heavenly gift, as the Paitan[16] puts it. We threw ourselves into\r\nthe breach, and covered it with our bodies against every attack. We\r\nallowed ourselves to be slain in hundreds and thousands rather than\r\nbecome unfaithful to it, and we bore witness to its truth, and watched\r\nover its purity, in the face of a hostile world. The Bible is our sole\r\n_raison d’être_; and it is just this which the Higher Anti-Semitism,\r\nboth within and without our ranks, is seeking to destroy, denying all\r\nour claims for the past and leaving us without hope for the future.\r\nThis intellectual persecution can only be fought with intellectual\r\nweapons, and unless we make an effort to recover our Bible we are\r\nirrevocably lost from both worlds.\r\n\r\n                                                   S.

It was feared\r\nthat the translation, being incorrect, might become the source of\r\nerror instead of being the fountain of divine truths. The fear felt\r\nand expressed about two thousand years ago has been fully justified by\r\nthe history of the several versions that have since been undertaken,\r\nand by the large number of false doctrines, supposed to be founded on\r\nthe authority of Holy Writ, whilst really originating in mistakes made\r\nby translators.\r\n\r\n                                                 M.

It\r\ncorrects many faults, amends many mistranslations of the so-called King\r\nJames’s Version, without impairing the antique charm of the English\r\nBible, without putting out of tune the music so dear to our ears. Yet\r\neven that great work, compiled by the most eminent scholars and learned\r\ntheologians in the land, is disfigured by errors due to dogmatic\r\npreconceptions.\r\n\r\n                                                  HERMANN ADLER, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nTHE present translation[17] has a character of its own. It aims to\r\ncombine the spirit of Jewish tradition with the results of biblical\r\nscholarship, ancient, mediaeval, and modern. It gives to the Jewish\r\nworld a translation of the Scriptures done by men imbued with the\r\nJewish consciousness, while the non-Jewish world, it is hoped, will\r\nwelcome a translation that presents many passages from the Jewish\r\ntraditional point of view.\r\n\r\nThe Jew cannot afford to have his own Bible translation prepared for\r\nhim by others. He cannot have it as a gift, even as he cannot borrow\r\nhis soul from others. If a new country and a new language metamorphose\r\nhim into a new man, the duty of this new man is to prepare a new garb\r\nand a new method of expression for what is most sacred and most dear\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n                                      _From_ TRANSLATORS’ PREFACE,\r\n                                  _Jewish Version of the Bible, 1916._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nSCRIPTURE must be interpreted according to its plain, natural sense,\r\neach word according to the context.

Israel’s\r\npre-eminence is not derived from Moses, it is Moses whose pre-eminence\r\nis due to Israel. The Divine love went out towards the multitude of the\r\nchildren of the Patriarchs, the Congregation of Jacob. Moses was merely\r\nthe divinely chosen instrument through whom God’s Blessing was to be\r\nassured unto them. We are called not the people of Moses, but the\r\npeople of God.\r\n\r\n                                                 YEHUDAH HALEVI, 1141.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE Greeks were not all artists, but the Greek nation was alone capable\r\nof producing a Phidias or a Praxiteles. The same was the case with\r\nJudaism. It is certain that not all Jews were prophets; the exclamation,\r\n‘Would that all the people of the Lord were prophets!’ was a pious\r\nwish. Nevertheless, Israel is the people of Revelation. It must have\r\nhad a native endowment that could produce, that could rear, such men.\r\nNor does Judaism claim to be the work of single individuals; it does\r\nnot speak of the God of Moses, nor of the God of the Prophets, but of\r\nthe God of Israel. The fact that the greatest prophet left his work\r\nunfinished contains a profound truth. _No man knoweth of his sepulchre\r\nunto this day._ Thereon our ancient teachers remark: ‘His grave should\r\nnot serve as a place of pilgrimage whither men go to do honour to _one\r\nman_, and thus raise him above the level of man’.\r\n\r\n                                                      A. GEIGER, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD AND ISRAEL IS HIS PROPHET[18]\r\n\r\n    WHEN one thinks how this earliest of\r\ntheistic creeds has persisted through the ages, by what wonderful\r\nconstructive statecraft it has built up a race of which the lowest unit\r\nis no atom in a ‘submerged tenth’, but an equal member of a great\r\nhistoric brotherhood, a scion of the oldest of surviving civilizations,\r\na student of sacred books, a lover of home and peace; when one\r\nremembers how he has agonized――the great misunderstood of history――how\r\nhis ‘pestilent heresy’ has been chastised and rebuked by Popes and\r\nCrusaders, Inquisitors and Missionaries, how he has remained sublimely\r\nprotestant, imperturbable amid marvellous cathedrals and all the\r\nsplendid shows of Christendom, and how despite all and after all he is\r\nliving to see the world turning slowly back to his vision of life; then\r\none seems to see the ‘finger of God’, the hand of the Master-Artist,\r\nbehind the comedy-tragedy of existence, to believe that Israel is\r\nveritably a nation with a mission, that there is no God but God and\r\nIsrael is His prophet.\r\n\r\n                                                      ISRAEL ZANGWILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MOSES[19]\r\n\r\nHOW small Sinai appears when Moses stands upon it! This mountain is\r\nonly the pedestal for the feet of the man whose head reaches up to\r\nthe heavens, where he speaks with God.... Formerly I could not pardon\r\nthe legislator of the Jews his hatred against the plastic arts. I\r\ndid not see that, notwithstanding his hostility to art, Moses was a\r\ngreat artist, and possessed the true artistic spirit. But this spirit\r\nwas directed by him, as by his Egyptian compatriots, to colossal and\r\nindestructible undertakings. He built human pyramids, carved human\r\nobelisks; he took a poor shepherd family and created a nation from\r\nit――a great, eternal, holy people; a people of God, destined to outlive\r\nthe centuries, and to serve as a pattern to all other nations, even as\r\na prototype to the whole of mankind. He created Israel.\r\n\r\nAs of the master-builder, so of his work――the Hebrew people――I did not\r\nspeak with sufficient reverence. I see now that the Greeks were only\r\nhandsome youths, whilst the Jews were always men――powerful, indomitable\r\nmen――who have fought and suffered on every battlefield of human thought.\r\n\r\n                                                       H.

It had but a\r\nprecarious hold on a few crags and highlands between the desert and\r\nthe deep sea, yet its thinkers and sages with eagle vision took into\r\ntheir thought the destinies of all humanity, and rang out in clarion\r\nvoice a message of hope to the downtrodden of all races. Claiming\r\nfor themselves and their people the duty and obligations of a true\r\naristocracy, they held forth to the peoples ideals of a true democracy\r\nfounded on right and justice. Their voices have never ceased to re-echo\r\naround the world, and the greatest things that have been done to raise\r\nmen’s lot have been always in the spirit, often in the name, of the\r\nHebrew prophets.\r\n\r\n                                                  JOSEPH JACOBS, 1919.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE mere foretelling of future events is the lowest stage of prophecy,\r\nand in the eyes of the great Prophets of Israel it was of quite\r\nsecondary importance. Their aim was to fathom the secrets of holiness;\r\nand their striving, by means of admonition and moral suasion, to guide\r\nthe peoples in the paths which lead mankind to spiritual and political\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\n                                            SHEMTOB IBN SHEMTOB, 1489.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nIT was part of the spirit of Prophecy to be dumb-founded at human\r\nferocity as at something against nature and reason. In the presence\r\nof the iniquities of the world, the heart of the Prophets bled as\r\nthough from a wound of the Divine Spirit, and their cry of indignation\r\nre-echoed the wrath of the Deity. Greece and Rome had their rich and\r\npoor, just as Israel had in the days of Jeroboam II, and the various\r\nclasses continued to slaughter one another for centuries; but no voice\r\nof justice and pity arose from the fierce tumult. Therefore the words\r\nof the Prophets have more vitality at the present time, and answer\r\nbetter to the needs of modern souls, than all the classic masterpieces\r\nof antiquity.\r\n\r\n                                              JAMES DARMESTETER, 1891.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN Hebrew prophecy we have no crumbling monument of perishable stone,\r\nthe silent witness of a past that is dead and gone, but the quickening\r\nbreath of the spirit itself. In the ardent souls of the Prophets\r\nthe thought of Deity was centred as in a burning-glass――a fire that\r\nconsumed them, a shining light for men. Theirs was the abiding sense\r\nof an eternal Will and Purpose underlying human transient schemes, an\r\neternal Presence, transfusing all of life as with a hidden flame; so\r\nthat love of country, love of right, love of man, were not alone human\r\nthings, but also divine, because they were embraced and focussed in a\r\nsingle living unity――the love of God.\r\n\r\n                                              JOSEPHINE LAZARUS, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TALMUD[21]\r\n\r\nTHE Talmud is the work which embodies the civil and canonical law of\r\nthe Jewish people, forming a kind of supplement to the Pentateuch――a\r\nsupplement such as took 1,000 years of a nation’s life to produce. It\r\nis not merely a dull treatise, but it appeals to the imagination and\r\nthe feelings, and to all that is noblest and purest. Between the rugged\r\nboulders of the law which bestrew the path of the Talmud there grow\r\nthe blue flowers of romance――parable, tale, gnome, saga; its elements\r\nare taken from heaven and earth, but chiefly and most lovingly from\r\nthe human heart and from Scripture, for every verse and every word in\r\nthis latter became, as it were, a golden nail upon which it hung its\r\ngorgeous tapestries.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental law of all human and social economy in the Talmud was\r\nthe absolute equality of men. It was pointed out that man was created\r\nalone――lest one should say to another, ‘I am of the better or earlier\r\nstock’. In a discussion that arose among the Masters as to which was\r\nthe most important passage in the whole Bible, one pointed to the verse\r\n‘And thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself’. The other contradicted\r\nhim and pointed to the words ‘This is the book of the generations of\r\nman’ (Gen. 5. 1)――not black, not white, not great, not small, but _man_.\r\n\r\n‘The law given on Mount Sinai’, the Masters said, ‘though emphatically\r\naddressed to one people, belongs to all humanity. It was not given in\r\nany king’s land, not in any city or inhabited spot――it was given on\r\nGod’s own highway, in the desert――not in the darkness and stillness\r\nof night, but in plain day, amid thunder and lightning. And why was it\r\ngiven on Sinai? Because it is the lowliest of mountains――to show that\r\nGod’s spirit rests only upon them that are meek and lowly in their\r\nhearts.’\r\n\r\nThe Talmud taught that religion was not a thing of creed or dogma or\r\nfaith merely, but of active goodness. Scripture said, ‘Ye shall walk in\r\nthe ways of the Lord’. ‘But the Lord is a consuming fire; how can men\r\nwalk in His ways?’ ‘By being’, the rabbis answered, ‘as He is――merciful,\r\nloving, long-suffering. Mark how on the first page of the Pentateuch\r\nGod clothed the naked――Adam; and on the last he buried the dead――Moses.\r\nHe heals the sick, frees the captives, does good to His enemies, and is\r\nmerciful both to the living and to the dead.’\r\n\r\nThe most transcendental love of the rabbis was lavished on children.\r\nAll the verses of Scripture that spoke of flowers and gardens were\r\napplied to children and schools. The highest and most exalted title\r\nwhich they bestowed in their poetical flights upon God Himself was that\r\nof ‘Pedagogue of Man’. Indeed, the relationship of man to God they\r\ncould not express more pregnantly than by the most familiar words which\r\noccur from one end of the Talmud to the other, ‘Our Father in Heaven’.\r\n\r\nI have been able to bring before you what proves, as it were, but\r\na drop in the vast ocean of Talmud――that strange, wild, weird ocean,\r\nwith its leviathans, and its wrecks of golden argosies, and with its\r\nforlorn bells that send up their dreamy sounds ever and anon, while the\r\nfisherman bends upon his oar, and starts and listens, and perchance the\r\ntears may come into his eyes.\r\n\r\n                                                EMANUEL DEUTSCH, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JEWISH LITERATURE\r\n\r\nRABBINISM was a sequel to the Bible, and if, like all sequels, it\r\nwas unequal to its original, it nevertheless shared its greatness.\r\nThe works of all Jews up to the modern period were the sequel to this\r\nsequel. Through them all may be detected the unifying principle that\r\nliterature in its truest sense includes life itself; that intellect\r\nis the handmaid to conscience; and that the best books are those which\r\nbest teach men how to live. This underlying unity gave more harmony\r\nto Jewish literature than is possessed by many literatures more\r\ndistinctively national. The maxim ‘Righteousness delivers from death’\r\napplies to books as well as to men. A literature whose consistent theme\r\nis Righteousness, is immortal.\r\n\r\n                                                    I. ABRAHAMS, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE WORK OF THE RABBIS[22]\r\n\r\nJUDAISM and the Bible are by no means identical; the Bible is only\r\none constituent part of Judaism, though the most fundamental one. Who\r\ntaught the average Jew to understand his Judaism, to love his religion\r\nand his God? Without the zeal of the Rabbis, the Bible would never have\r\nbecome the guide of every Jew. They translated it into the vernacular\r\nfor the people, and expounded it to the masses. They taught them not\r\nto despair under the tortures of the present, but to look forward to\r\nthe future. At the same time they developed the spirit of the Bible\r\nand never lost sight of the lofty teachings of the Prophets. It is\r\nthe immortal merit of the unknown Rabbis of the centuries immediately\r\nbefore and after the common era that they found and applied the proper\r\n‘fences’ for the preservation of Judaism, and that they succeeded in\r\nrescuing real morality and pure monotheism for the ages that were to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n                                                     A.

Line upon line is still being added, and _finis_\r\nwill never be written on the page of Jewish history till the Light\r\nwhich shineth more and more unto the Perfect Day shall fall upon\r\nit, and illumine the whole beautiful world. Each Jew and each Jewess\r\nis making his or her mark, or his or her stain, upon the wonderful\r\nunfinished history of the Jews, the history which Herder called the\r\ngreatest poem of all time. _‘Ye are my witnesses’, saith the Lord._\r\nLoyal and steadfast witnesses is it, or self-seeking and suborned ones?\r\nA witness of some sort every Jew born is bound to be. He must fulfil\r\nhis mission, and through good report and through evil report, and\r\nthough it be only writ in water, he must add his item of evidence to\r\nthe record that all who run may read.\r\n\r\n                                                    LADY MAGNUS, 1886.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE story of this little sect――the most remarkable survival of the\r\nfittest known to humanity――in no way corresponds with its numbers; it\r\nis not a tale of majorities. It is a story that begins very near the\r\nbeginning of history, and shows little sign of drawing to a conclusion.\r\nIt is a story that has chapters in every country on earth, that has\r\nborne the impress of every period. All men and all ages pass through it\r\nin unending procession.\r\n\r\n                                                ISRAEL ZANGWILL, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE MEANING OF JEWISH HISTORY\r\n\r\nMAN is made man by history. It is history that causes the men\r\nof historic nations to be more civilized than the savage. The Jew\r\nrecognizes that he is made what he is by the history of his fathers,\r\nand feels he is losing his better self so far as he loses his hold on\r\nhis past history.\r\n\r\n                                                  JOSEPH JACOBS, 1889.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nISRAEL is the heart of mankind.\r\n\r\n                                                       YEHUDAH HALEVI.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE high-road of Jewish history leads to wide outlooks. That which is\r\ngreat and lasting in Jewish history is the spiritual wealth accumulated\r\nthrough the ages; the description of the fierce battles fought between\r\nthe powers of darkness and light, of freedom and persecution, of\r\nknowledge and ignorance. Our great men are the heroes of the school\r\nand the sages of the synagogue, not the knights of the sanguinary\r\nbattlefield. No widow was left to mourn through our victory, no mother\r\nfor her lost son, no orphan for the lost father.\r\n\r\n                                                      M. GASTER, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE HALLOWING OF JEWISH HISTORY\r\n\r\nTHE first part of Jewish history, the Biblical part, is a source\r\nfrom which, for many centuries, millions of human beings belonging to\r\nthe most diverse denominations have derived instruction, solace, and\r\ninspiration. Its heroes have long ago become types, incarnations, of\r\ngreat ideas. The events it relates serve as living ethical formulas.\r\nBut a time will come――perhaps it is not very far off――when the second\r\nhalf of Jewish history, the record of the two thousand years of the\r\nJewish people’s life after the Biblical period, will be accorded the\r\nsame treatment. The thousand years’ martyrdom of the Jewish people,\r\nits unbroken pilgrimage, its tragic fate, its teachers of religion,\r\nits martyrs, philosophers, champions――this whole epic will in days to\r\ncome sink deep into the memory of men. It will speak to the heart and\r\nconscience of men, not merely to their curious mind. It will secure\r\nrespect for the silvery hair of the Jewish people, a people of thinkers\r\nand sufferers. It is our firm conviction that the time is approaching\r\nin which the second half of Jewish history will be to the noblest part\r\nof _thinking_ humanity what its first half has long been to _believing_\r\nhumanity, a source of sublime moral truths.\r\n\r\n                                                   S.

It was as if all the powers of earth had\r\nconspired――and they did so conspire――to exterminate the Jewish people,\r\nor at least to transform it into a brutalized horde. History dare not\r\npass over in silence these scenes of wellnigh unutterable misery. It\r\nis her duty to give a true and vivid account of them; to evoke due\r\nadmiration for the superhuman endurance of this suffering people,\r\nand to testify that Israel, like his ancestor in the days of old, has\r\nstriven with gods and with men, and has prevailed.\r\n\r\n                                                            H. GRAETZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       UNDER THE ROMAN EMPERORS\r\n\r\nTHERE had now a tumult arisen in Alexandria between the Jewish\r\ninhabitants and the Greeks, and three ambassadors were chosen out of\r\neach party that were at variance who came to Caius (Caligula). Now,\r\none of the Greek ambassadors was Apion, who uttered many blasphemies\r\nagainst the Jews; and among other things he said that while all who\r\nwere subject to the Roman Empire built altars and temples to Caesar,\r\nand in other regards universally received him as they received the\r\ngods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonourable thing for them to\r\nerect statues in honour of him, as well as to swear by his name.\r\n\r\nHereupon Caligula, taking it very heinously that he should be thus\r\ndespised by the Jews alone, gave orders to make an invasion of Judea\r\nwith a great body of troops, and, if they were obstinate, to conquer\r\nthem by war, and then to erect the statues. Accordingly Petronius,\r\nthe Governor of Syria, got together as great a number of auxiliaries\r\nas he possibly could, and took with him two legions of the Roman army.\r\nBut there came many ten thousands of the Jews to Petronius, to offer\r\ntheir petitions to him, that he would not compel them to transgress\r\nand violate the law of their forefathers. ‘If’, said they, ‘thou art\r\nentirely resolved to bring this statue, and erect it, do thou first\r\nkill us, and then do what thou hast resolved on; for, while we are\r\nalive, we cannot permit such things as are forbidden us to be done by\r\nthe authority of our Legislator.’\r\n\r\nPetronius then hasted to Tiberias; and many thousands of the Jews met\r\nPetronius again, when he was come to Tiberias. Then Petronius said to\r\nthem: ‘Will you then make war with Caesar without considering his great\r\npreparations for war and your own weakness?’ They replied: ‘We will not\r\nby any means make war with him, but still we will die before we see our\r\nlaws transgressed’. So they threw themselves down upon their faces, and\r\nstretched out their throats, and said they were ready to be slain. Thus\r\nthey continued in their resolution, and proposed to themselves to die\r\nwillingly rather than to see the dedication of the statue[23].\r\n\r\n                                           FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS, 1st cent.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the world-wide Roman Empire it was the Jews alone who refused the\r\nerection of statues and the paying of divine honours to Caligula, and\r\n_thereby saved the honour of the human race_ when all the other peoples\r\nslavishly obeyed the decree of the Imperial madman.\r\n\r\n                                                      J. FUERST, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN MEDIAEVAL ROME\r\n\r\nIN the whole history of heroism there is nothing finer than the example\r\nof the Jews of the Roman Ghetto, a handful of men who for 1,500 years\r\nand longer remained true to their own ideals――unmoved and undazzled by\r\nthe triumphant world-power of the dominant faith; and undaunted\r\n\r\n            By the torture prolonged from age to age,\r\n            By the infamy, Israel’s heritage,\r\n            By the Ghetto’s plague, by the garb’s disgrace,\r\n            By the badge of shame, by the felon’s place,\r\n            By the branding tool, by the bloody whip,\r\n            And the summons to Christian fellowship.\r\n\r\nHelpless victims of all the horrors enumerated in these burning lines\r\nof Robert Browning, these Jews were yet _free men_. Not a trace of what\r\na modern Jewish thinker――Achad Ha’am――has called ‘spiritual slavery’\r\nwas theirs.

The monk\r\nRudolph who shamefully persecuted Israel, arose against the people of\r\nGod, in order, like Haman of old, to destroy, to slay, and to cause\r\nto perish. He travelled throughout Germany to bestow the cross of the\r\ncrusaders upon all who consented to set out for Jerusalem to fight\r\nagainst the Moslems. In every place where he came he aroused the\r\npeople, crying, ‘Avenge ye first the vengeance of our God on His\r\nenemies who are here before us, and then we will go forward’. When the\r\nJews heard this, their courage failed them by reason of the rage of\r\ntheir oppressor who sought their destruction. They cried to God, saying:\r\n‘Alas, O Lord God! Behold fifty years, like the period of a jubilee,\r\nhave not yet elapsed since we shed our blood like water to sanctify Thy\r\nholy, great, and revered Name, on the day of the great slaughter. Wilt\r\nThou indeed forsake us for ever and extend Thy wrath against us unto\r\nall generations? Shall misery follow misery?’\r\n\r\nThe Lord heard our supplications, and turned unto us, and had pity\r\nupon us, according to His abundant loving-kindness. He sent one of\r\ntheir greatest and respected teachers, the abbot Bernard, from the town\r\nClairvaux in France, after this evil monk. And he also preached to his\r\npeople according to their custom, crying ‘It is good that you are ready\r\nto go forth against the Moslems; but whosoever uses violence against\r\nthe Jews commits a deadly sin’.\r\n\r\nAll honoured this monk as one of their saints, neither has it ever been\r\nsaid that he received a bribe for his good service to us. Many desisted\r\nfrom any further murderous attacks against us. We gladly gave our\r\npossessions as a ransom for our lives. Whatever was asked of us, silver\r\nor gold, we withheld not.\r\n\r\nIf our Creator in His great compassion had not sent us this abbot,\r\nthere would have been none in Israel that would have escaped or\r\nremained alive. Blessed be He who saves and delivers. Praised be His\r\nName.\r\n\r\n                                                EPHRAIM OF BONN, 1180.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JEWISH SUFFERING\r\n\r\n                BREAK forth in lamentation,\r\n                    My agonizing song,\r\n                That like a lava-torrent\r\n                    Has boiled within me long.\r\n\r\n                My song shall thrill each hearer,\r\n                    And none so deaf but hears,\r\n                For the burden of my ditty\r\n                    Is the pain of a thousand years.\r\n\r\n                It melts both gentle and simple,\r\n                    Even hearts of stone are riven――\r\n                Sets women and flowers weeping;\r\n                    They weep, the stars of heaven.\r\n\r\n                And all these tears are flowing\r\n                    By channels still and wide,\r\n                Homeward they are all flowing\r\n                    To meet in Jordan’s tide.\r\n\r\n                                      H. HEINE, 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE JEWS OF YORK (1190)\r\n\r\nWHEN Richard I ascended the throne, the Jews, to conciliate the Royal\r\nprotection, brought their tributes. Many had hastened from remote\r\nparts of England, and, appearing at Westminster, the Court and the\r\nmob imagined that they had leagued to bewitch His Majesty. A rumour\r\nspread rapidly through the city that in honour of the festival the Jews\r\nwere to be massacred. The populace, at once eager of Royalty and riot,\r\npillaged and burnt their houses and murdered the devoted Jews.\r\n\r\nThe people of York soon gathered to imitate the people of London. The\r\nalarmed Jews hastened to Jocenus, the most opulent of the Jews, who\r\nconducted them to the Governor of York Castle, and prevailed on him to\r\nafford them an asylum for their persons and effects.\r\n\r\nThe castle had sufficient strength for their defence; but a suspicion\r\narising that the Governor, who often went out, intended to betray them,\r\nthey one day refused him entrance. He complained to the sheriff of the\r\ncounty; and the chiefs of the violent party, who stood deeply indebted\r\nto the Jews, uniting with him, orders were issued to attack the castle.\r\nThe cruel multitude, united with the soldiery, felt such a desire\r\nof slaughtering those they intended to despoil, that the sheriff,\r\nrepenting of the order, revoked it; but in vain: fanaticism and robbery\r\nonce set loose will satiate their appetency for blood and plunder. The\r\nattacks continued, till at length the Jews perceived they could hold\r\nout no longer, and a council was called to consider what remained to be\r\ndone in the extremity of danger.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jewish council was assembled, the Haham[25] rose, and\r\naddressed them in this manner: ‘Men of Israel! the God of our ancestors\r\nis omniscient, and there is no one who can say, Why doest Thou this?\r\nThis day He commands us to die for His Law; for that Law which we have\r\ncherished from the first hour it was given, which we have preserved\r\npure throughout our captivity in all nations; and for which, because\r\nof the many consolations it has given us and the eternal hope it\r\ncommunicates, can we do less than die? Death is before our eyes; and\r\nwe have only to choose an honourable and easy one. If we fall into the\r\nhands of our enemies, which you know we cannot escape, our death will\r\nbe ignominious and cruel. It is therefore my advice that we elude their\r\ntortures; that we ourselves should be our own executioners; and that we\r\nvoluntarily surrender our lives to our Creator. God seems to call for\r\nus, but let us not be unworthy of that call.’ Having said this, the old\r\nman sat down and wept.\r\n\r\nThe assembly was divided in its opinions. Again the Rabbin rose, and\r\nspoke these few words in a firm and decisive tone. ‘My children! since\r\nwe are not unanimous in our opinions, let those who do not approve of\r\nmy advice depart from this assembly!’ Some departed, but the greater\r\nnumber attached themselves to their venerable priest. They now employed\r\nthemselves in consuming their valuables by fire; and every man, fearful\r\nof trusting to the timid and irresolute hand of the women, first\r\ndestroyed his wife and children, and then himself. Jocenus and the\r\nRabbin alone remained. Their life was protracted to the last, that\r\nthey might see everything performed according to their orders. Jocenus,\r\nbeing the chief Jew, was distinguished by the last mark of human\r\nrespect in receiving his death from the consecrated hand of the aged\r\nRabbin, who immediately after performed the melancholy duty on himself.\r\n\r\nAll this was transacted in the depth of the night. In the morning the\r\nwalls of the castle were seen wrapt in flames, and only a few miserable\r\nand pusillanimous beings, unworthy of the sword, were viewed on the\r\nbattlements pointing to their extinct brethren. When they opened the\r\ngates of the castle, these men verified the prediction of their late\r\nRabbin; for the multitude, bursting through the solitary courts, found\r\nthemselves defrauded of their hopes, and in a moment avenged themselves\r\non the feeble wretches who knew not to die with honour.\r\n\r\n                                                ISAAC D’ISRAELI, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE EXPULSION FROM SPAIN, 1492\r\n\r\n          LOOK, they move!

The townsman spits at their garments, the shepherd quits his flock,\r\nthe peasant his plough, to pelt with curses and stones; the villager\r\nsets on their trail his yelping cur.\r\n\r\n10.

Nina Salaman._)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SHYLOCK\r\n\r\nSHYLOCK is ‘the Jew that Shakespeare drew’. He is not the Jew of real\r\nlife, even in the Middle Ages, stained as their story is with the hot\r\ntears――nay, the very heart’s blood――of the martyred race. The mediaeval\r\nJew did not take vengeance on his cruel foes. Nay, more than this:\r\nwith a sublime magnanimity he could actually preach and practise widest\r\nbenevolence towards his oppressors. Throughout the Middle Ages, when\r\nJews were daily plundered and tortured, and done to death ‘for the\r\nglory of God’, not a word was breathed against the morality of the\r\nvictims. They suffered because they were heretics, because they would\r\nnot juggle with their conscience and profess a belief that did not live\r\nin their souls. But Jewish ethics soared to still nobler heights. The\r\nJew preserved his integrity in spite of his suffering; but more than\r\nthis, he forgave――ay, even blessed――its authors. The Jews hunted out\r\nof Spain in 1492 were in turn cruelly expelled from Portugal. Some\r\ntook refuge on the African coast. Eighty years later the descendants of\r\nthe men who had committed or allowed these enormities were defeated in\r\nAfrica, whither they had been led by their king, Dom Sebastian. Those\r\nwho were not slain were offered as slaves at Fez to the descendants of\r\nthe Jewish exiles from Portugal. ‘The humbled Portuguese nobles’, the\r\nhistorian narrates, ‘were comforted when their purchasers proved to be\r\nJews, for they knew that they had humane hearts.’\r\n\r\n                                                  MORRIS JOSEPH, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ON THE EVE OF THE RE-SETTLEMENT IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nTHE Lord, blessed for ever, by His prophet Jeremiah (chap. 29. 7)\r\ngives it in command to the captive Israelites that were dispersed\r\namong the heathens, that they should continually pray for and endeavour\r\nthe peace, welfare, and prosperity of the city wherein they dwelt and\r\nthe inhabitants thereof. This the Jews have always done, and continue\r\nto this day in all their synagogues, with a particular blessing of\r\nthe prince or magistrate under whose protection they live. And this\r\nthe Right Honourable my Lord St. John can testify, who, when he was\r\nambassador to the Lords the States of the United Provinces, was pleased\r\nto honour our synagogue at Amsterdam with his presence, where our\r\nnation entertained him with music and all expressions of joy and\r\ngladness, and also pronounced a blessing, not only upon His Honour then\r\npresent, but upon the whole Commonwealth of England, for that they were\r\na people in league and amity, and because we conceived some hopes that\r\nthey would manifest towards us what we ever bare towards them, viz. all\r\nlove and affection.\r\n\r\n                                            MANASSEH BEN ISRAEL, 1656.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JEWISH EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nTHE whole question of emancipation, as it concerns only our external\r\ncondition, is in Judaism but of secondary interest. Sooner or later\r\nthe nations will decide the question between right and wrong, between\r\nhumanity and inhumanity; and the first awakening of a higher calling\r\nthan the mere lust for possession and enjoyment, the first expression\r\nof a nobler recognition of God as the only Lord and Father, and of\r\nthe earth as a Holy Land assigned by Him to all men for the fulfilment\r\nof their human calling――will find its expression everywhere in the\r\nemancipation of all who are oppressed, including the Jews. We have a\r\nhigher object to attain, and this is entirely in our own hands――the\r\nennobling of ourselves, the realization of Judaism by Jews.\r\n\r\n                                          SAMSON RAPHAEL HIRSCH, 1836.\r\n                                            (_Trans.

Britain’s mild sovereignty\r\nrespects the personality of the ethnic groups found within the borders\r\nof its world-wide dominion; nay, it fosters the linguistic heritage,\r\nthe national individuality even, of Irishman and Welshman, of French\r\nCanadian and Afrikander Boer, and encourages them all to develop along\r\ntheir own lines. Any one, therefore, who deems that patriotism exacts\r\nfrom him the purposeless sacrifice of his religious tradition and\r\nhistoric memory――that man is an alien in spirit to the Anglo-Saxon\r\ngenius, and is unworthy of his British citizenship.\r\n\r\n                                                    J.

The story of\r\nthe Russian Jew is the story of the coal. Under a surface marred by\r\noppression and persecution he has accumulated immense stores of energy,\r\nin which we may find an unlimited supply of light and heat for our\r\nminds and our hearts. All we need is to discover the process, long\r\nknown in the case of coal, of transforming latent strength into living\r\npower.\r\n\r\n                                                 I.

Six million speakers are\r\nsufficient to give historic dignity to any language! One great writer\r\nalone is enough to make it holy and immortal. Take Norwegian. It is the\r\nlanguage of only two million people. But it has become immortal through\r\nthe great literary achievements of Ibsen. And even though Yiddish\r\ncannot boast of so great a writer as Ibsen, it has reason to be proud\r\nof numerous smaller men――poets, romancers, satirists, dramatists.\r\n\r\nThe main point is that Yiddish incorporates the essence of a life which\r\nis distinctive and unlike any other. There is nothing of holiness in\r\nany of the outer expressions of life. The one and only thing holy is\r\nthe _human soul_, which is the source and fount of all human effort.\r\n\r\n                                                ISRAEL ZANGWILL, 1906.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE is probably no other language in existence on which so much\r\nopprobrium has been heaped as on Yiddish. Such a bias can be explained\r\nonly as a manifestation of a general prejudice against everything\r\nJewish.\r\n\r\n                                                     LEO WIENER, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        RUSSO-JEWISH EDUCATION\r\n\r\nAMONG the Jews of Poland and Russia there was no learned estate, not\r\nbecause there were no scholars, but because the people itself was a\r\nnation of students. The ideal type for the Russian Jew was the _Lamdan_,\r\nthe scholar. The highest ambition of the Russian Jew was that his sons,\r\nand if he had only daughters, that his sons-in-law should be _Lomdim_;\r\nand the greatest achievement of a man’s life was his ability to provide\r\nsufficiently for them, so that, relieved from economic cares, they\r\nmight devote themselves unrestrictedly to Jewish learning. To be sure,\r\nthis learning was one-sided. Yet it was both wide and deep, for it\r\nembraced the almost boundless domain of religious Hebrew literature,\r\nand involved the knowledge of one of the most complicated systems of\r\nlaw. The knowledge of the Hebrew prayers and the Five Books of Moses\r\nwould not have been sufficient to save the Russian Jew from the most\r\nterrible opprobrium――that of being an _Am-Haaretz_, an ignoramus.\r\nThe ability to understand a Talmudic text, which demands years of\r\npreparation, was the minimum requirement for one who wanted to be of\r\nany consequence in the community.\r\n\r\n                                                 I. FRIEDLANDER, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PASSOVER IN OLD RUSSIA[33]\r\n\r\nTHE Passover season, when we celebrated our deliverance from the land\r\nof Egypt, and felt so glad and thankful as if it had only just happened,\r\nwas the time our Gentile neighbours chose to remind us that Russia was\r\nanother Egypt. It was not so bad within the Pale; but in Russian cities,\r\nand even more in the country districts, where Jewish families lived\r\nscattered by special permission of the police, who were always changing\r\ntheir minds about letting them stay, the Gentiles made the Passover\r\na time of horror for the Jews. Somebody would start up that lie about\r\nmurdering Christian children, and the stupid peasants would get mad\r\nabout it, and fill themselves with vodka, and set out to kill the Jews.\r\nThey attacked them with knives and clubs, and scythes and axes, killed\r\nthem or tortured them, and burned their houses. This was called a\r\n‘pogrom’. Jews who escaped the pogroms came with wounds on them, and\r\nhorrible, horrible stories of little babies torn limb from limb before\r\ntheir mother’s eyes. Only to hear these things made one sob and sob and\r\nchoke with pain. People who saw such things never smiled any more, no\r\nmatter how long they lived; and sometimes their hair turned white in a\r\nday, and some people became insane on the spot.\r\n\r\n                                                     MARY ANTIN, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE POGROM\r\n                             OCTOBER, 1905\r\n\r\nIT had already lasted two days. But as nobody dined, nobody exchanged\r\ngreetings, and nobody thought of winding up the clock for the night\r\n(for people slept dressed, anywhere, on lofts, in sheds, or in empty\r\nrailway carriages), all notion of time had disappeared. People only\r\nheard the incessant jingling of broken glass-panes. At this terrible\r\nsound, the arms stiffened and the eyes became distended with fright.\r\n\r\nSome distant houses were burning. Along the red-tinted street with the\r\nred pavement, there ran by a red man, whilst another red man stretched\r\nhis arm, and from the tips of his fingers there broke forth quickly a\r\nsharp, snapping, cracking sound――and the running man dropped down.\r\n\r\nA strange, sharp cry, ‘They are shoo-ooting!’ passed along the street.\r\n\r\nInvisible and inexorable demons made their appearance. Houses and\r\nnurseries were broken in. Old men had their arms fractured; women’s\r\nwhite bosoms were trampled upon by heavy, dirty heels. Many were\r\nperishing by torture; others were burnt alive.\r\n\r\nTwo persons were hiding in a dark cellar; an old man with his son, a\r\nschoolboy. The old man went up and opened the outer door again, to make\r\nthe place look deserted by the owners. A merchant had run in. He wept,\r\nnot from fear but from feeling himself in security.\r\n\r\n‘I have a son like you’, he said, tearfully.\r\n\r\nHe then breathed heavily and nervously, and added reflectively, ‘Like\r\nyou, my boy, yes!’\r\n\r\nThe master of the house caught the merchant by his elbow, pulled him\r\nclose to himself, and whispered into his ear:\r\n\r\n‘Hush! They might hear us!’\r\n\r\nThere they stood, expectant. Now and then, a rustling; an even,\r\nsleepless breathing could be heard. The brain cannot familiarize itself\r\nwith these sounds in the darkness and silence. Perhaps they were asleep,\r\nnone could tell.\r\n\r\nAt night――it must have been late at night――another two stole in quietly.\r\n\r\n‘Is it you?’ asked one of them, without seeing anybody, and the sudden\r\nsound of his voice seemed to light up the darkness for a moment.\r\n\r\n‘Yes’, answered the schoolboy. ‘It’s all right!’\r\n\r\n‘Hush! They might hear you’, said the owner of the cellar, catching\r\neach of them by the arm and pulling them down.\r\n\r\nThe new-comers placed themselves by the wall, while one of them was\r\nrubbing his forehead with his hand.\r\n\r\n‘What is the matter?’ asked the schoolboy in a whisper.\r\n\r\n‘It is blood.’\r\n\r\nThen they grew silent. The injured man applied a handkerchief to\r\nhis wound, and became quiet. There followed again a thick silence,\r\nuntroubled by time. Again a sleepless breathing!\r\n\r\nOn the top, underneath the ceiling, a very faint whiteness appeared.\r\nThe schoolboy was asleep, but the other four raised their heads and\r\nlooked up. They looked long, for about half an hour, so that their\r\nmuscles were aching through the protracted craning of their necks. At\r\nlast it became clear that it was a tiny little window through which\r\ndawn peeped in.\r\n\r\nThen hasty, frightened steps were heard, and there appeared a tall,\r\ncoatless man, followed by a woman with a baby in her arms. The dawn was\r\nadvancing, and one could read the expression of wild fear that stamped\r\nitself upon their faces.\r\n\r\n‘This way! This way!’ whispered the man.\r\n\r\n‘They are running after us, they are looking out for us’, said\r\nthe woman. Her shoes were put on her bare feet, and her young body\r\ndisplayed strange, white, malignant spots, reminding one of a corpse.\r\n\r\n‘They won’t find us; but, for God’s sake, be quiet!’\r\n\r\n‘They are close by in the courtyard. Oh! be quiet, be quiet....’\r\n\r\nThe wounded man got hold of the merchant and the owner by the hand,\r\nwhile the merchant seized the man who had no coat. There they stood,\r\nforming a live chain, looking on at the mother with her baby.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden there broke out a strange though familiar sound, so\r\nclose and doomful. What doom it foreboded they felt at once, but their\r\nbrains were loath to believe it.\r\n\r\nThe sound was repeated. It was the cry of the infant. The merchant made\r\na kindly face and said: ‘Baby is crying....’\r\n\r\n‘Lull him, my dear’, said he, rushing to the mother. ‘You will cause\r\nthe death of us all.’\r\n\r\nEverybody’s chest and throat gasped with faintness. The mother marched\r\nup and down the cellar lulling and coaxing.\r\n\r\n‘You must not cry; sleep, my golden one ... It is I, your mother ... my\r\nheart....’\r\n\r\nBut the child cried on obstinately, wildly. There must have been\r\nsomething in the mother’s face that was not calculated to produce a\r\ntranquilizing effect.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in this warm and strange underground atmosphere, the woman’s\r\nbrain wrenched out a wild, mad, idea. It seemed to her that she had\r\nread it in the eyes, in the suffering silence of these unknown people.\r\nAnd these unhappy, frightened men understood that she was thinking of\r\nthem. They understood it by the unutterably mournful tenderness with\r\nwhich she chanted, while drinking in the infant’s eyes with her own.\r\n\r\n‘He will soon fall asleep. I know. It is always like that; he cries for\r\na moment, then he falls asleep at once. He is a very quiet boy.’ She\r\naddressed the tall man with a painful, insinuating smile. From outside\r\nthere broke in a distant noise. Then came a thud, and a crack, shaking\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n‘They are searching’, whispered the schoolboy.\r\n\r\nBut the infant went on crying hopelessly.\r\n\r\n‘He will undo us all’, blurted out the tall man.\r\n\r\n‘I shall not give him away ... no, never!’ ejaculated the distracted\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n‘O God’, whispered the merchant, and covered his face with his hands.\r\nHis hair was unkempt after a sleepless night. The tall man stared at\r\nthe infant with fixed, protruding eyes....\r\n\r\n‘I don’t know you’, the woman uttered, low and crossly, on catching\r\nthat fixed look. ‘Who are you? What do you want of me?’\r\n\r\nShe rushed to the other men, but everybody drew back from her with fear.\r\nThe infant was crying on, piercing the brain with its shouting.\r\n\r\n‘Give it to me’, said the merchant, his right eyebrow trembling.\r\n‘Children like me.’\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden it grew dark in the cellar; somebody had approached\r\nthe little window and was listening. At this shadow, breaking in so\r\nsuddenly, they all grew quiet. They felt that it was coming, it was\r\nnear, and that not another second must be lost.\r\n\r\nThe mother turned round. She stood up on her toes, and with high,\r\nuplifted arms she handed over her child to the merchant. It seemed to\r\nher that by this gesture she was committing a terrible crime ... that\r\nhissing voices were cursing her, rejecting her from heaven for ever and\r\never....\r\n\r\nStrange to say, finding itself in the thick, clumsy, but loving hands\r\nof the merchant, the child grew silent.\r\n\r\nBut the mother interpreted this silence differently. In sight of\r\neverybody the woman grew grey in a single moment, as if they had\r\npoured some acid over her hair. And as soon as the child’s cry died\r\naway, there resounded another cry, more awful, more shattering and\r\nheart-rending.\r\n\r\nThe mother rose up on her toes; and grey, terrible, like the goddess of\r\njustice herself, she howled in a desperate, inhuman voice that brought\r\ndestruction with it.... Nobody had expected that sudden madness. The\r\nschoolboy fell in a swoon.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfterwards, the newspapers reported details of the killing of six men\r\nand an infant by the mob; for none had dared to touch the mad old woman\r\nof twenty-six.\r\n\r\n                                                    OSSIP DYMOV, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          UNDER THE ROMANOFFS\r\n\r\nTHE plaything of a heartless bureaucracy, the natural prey of all the\r\nsavage elements of society, loaded with fetters in one place, and in\r\nanother driven out like some wild beast, the Russian Jew finds that\r\nfor him, at least, life is composed of little else than bitterness,\r\nsuffering, and degradation.\r\n\r\nFor magnitude and gloom the tragical situation has no parallel in\r\nhistory.

It was what was done to unprotected Jewish children who fell\r\ninto the hands of priests or nuns. They might baptize me. That would\r\nbe worse than death by torture. Every Jewish child had that feeling.\r\nThere were stories by the dozen of Jewish boys who were kidnapped by\r\nthe Czar’s agents and brought up in Gentile families till they were old\r\nenough to enter the army, where they served until forty years of age;\r\nand all those years the priests tried, by bribes and daily tortures,\r\nto force them to accept baptism, but in vain. This was the time of\r\nNicholas I.\r\n\r\nSome of these ‘soldiers of Nicholas’, as they were called, were taken\r\nas little boys of seven or eight――snatched from their mothers’ laps.\r\nThey were carried to distant villages, where their friends could never\r\ntrace them, and turned over to some dirty, brutal peasant, who used\r\nthem like slaves, and kept them with the pigs. No two were ever left\r\ntogether; and they were given false names, so that they were entirely\r\ncut off from their own world. And then the lonely child was turned over\r\nto the priests, and he was flogged and starved and terrified――a little\r\nhelpless boy who cried for his mother; but still he refused to be\r\nbaptized. The priests promised him good things to eat, fine clothes,\r\nand freedom from labour; but the boy turned away, and said his prayers\r\nsecretly――the Hebrew prayers.\r\n\r\nAs he grew older, severer tortures were invented for him; still he\r\nrefused baptism. By this time he had forgotten his mother’s face, and\r\nof his prayers perhaps only the ‘Shema’ remained in his memory; but he\r\nwas a Jew, and nothing would make him change. After he entered the army,\r\nhe was bribed with promises of promotions and honours. He remained a\r\nprivate, and endured the cruellest discipline. When he was discharged,\r\nat the age of forty, he was a broken man, without a home, without a\r\nclue to his origin, and he spent the rest of his life wandering among\r\nJewish settlements, searching for his family, hiding the scars of\r\ntorture under his rags, begging his way from door to door.\r\n\r\nThere were men in our town whose faces made you old in a minute. They\r\nhad served Nicholas I, and come back, unbaptized.\r\n\r\n                                                     MARY ANTIN, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BONTZYE SHWEIG[35]\r\n                         (BONTZYE THE SILENT)\r\n\r\nDOWN here, in this world, Silent Bontzye’s death made no impression at\r\nall. Ask any one you like who Bontzye was, how he lived, and what he\r\ndied of; whether of heart failure, or whether his strength gave out, or\r\nwhether his back broke under a heavy load, and they won’t know. Perhaps,\r\nafter all, he died of hunger.\r\n\r\nBontzye lived quietly and died quietly. He passed through our world\r\nlike a shadow. He lived like a little dun-coloured grain of sand on\r\nthe sea-shore, among millions of his kind; and when the wind lifted him\r\nand blew him over to the other side of the sea, nobody noticed it. When\r\nhe was alive, the mud in the street preserved no impression of his feet;\r\nafter his death the wind overturned the little board on his grave. The\r\ngrave-digger’s wife found it a long way off from the spot, and boiled a\r\npotful of potatoes over it. Three days after that, the grave-digger had\r\nforgotten where he had laid him.\r\n\r\nA shadow! His likeness remained photographed in nobody’s brain, in\r\nnobody’s heart; not a trace of him remained.\r\n\r\n‘No kith, no kin!’ He lived and died alone.\r\n\r\nHad the world been less busy, some one might have remarked that\r\nBontzye (also a human being) went about with two extinguished eyes and\r\nfearfully hollow cheeks; that even when he had no load on his shoulders\r\nhis head drooped earthward as though, while yet alive, he were looking\r\nfor his grave. When they carried Bontzye into the hospital, his corner\r\nin the underground lodging was soon filled――there were ten of his like\r\nwaiting for it, and they put it up for auction among themselves. When\r\nthey carried him from the hospital bed to the dead-house, there were\r\ntwenty poor sick persons waiting for the bed. When he had been taken\r\nout of the dead-house, they brought in twenty bodies from under a\r\nbuilding that had fallen in. Who knows how long he will rest in his\r\ngrave? Who knows how many are waiting for the little plot of ground?\r\n\r\nA quiet birth, a quiet life, a quiet death, and a quieter burial.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nBut it was not so in the Other World. There Bontzye’s death made a\r\ngreat impression.\r\n\r\nThe blast of the great Messianic Shofar sounded through all the seven\r\nheavens; Bontzye Shweig has left the earth! The largest angels with the\r\nbroadest wings flew about and told one another; Bontzye Shweig is to\r\ntake his seat in the Heavenly Academy! In Paradise there was a noise\r\nand a joyful tumult: Bontzye Shweig! Just fancy! Bontzye Shweig!\r\n\r\nLittle child-angels with sparkling eyes, gold thread-work wings, and\r\nsilver slippers, ran delightedly to meet him. The rustle of the wings,\r\nthe clatter of the little slippers, and the merry laughter of the fresh,\r\nrosy mouths, filled all the heavens and reached to the Throne of Glory.\r\nAbraham our father stood in the gate, his right hand stretched out with\r\na hearty greeting, and a sweet smile lit up his old face.\r\n\r\nWhat are they wheeling through heaven? Two angels are pushing a golden\r\narm-chair into Paradise for Bontzye Shweig.\r\n\r\nWhat flashed so brightly? They were carrying past a gold crown set with\r\nprecious stones all for Bontzye Shweig.\r\n\r\n‘Before the decision of the Heavenly Court has been given?’ ask\r\nthe saints, not quite without jealousy. ‘Oh’, reply the angels, ‘that\r\nwill be a mere formality. Even the prosecutor won’t say a word against\r\nBontzye Shweig. The case will not last five minutes.’ Just consider!\r\nBontzye Shweig!\r\n\r\nAll this time, Bontzye, just as in the other world, was too frightened\r\nto speak. He is sure it is all a dream, or else simply a mistake. He\r\ndared not raise his eyes, lest the dream should vanish, lest he should\r\nwake up in some cave full of snakes and lizards. He was afraid to speak,\r\nafraid to move, lest he should be recognized and flung into the pit.\r\nHe trembles and does not hear the angels’ compliments, does not see how\r\nthey dance round him, makes no answer to the greeting of Abraham our\r\nfather, and when he is led into the presence of the Heavenly Court he\r\ndoes not even wish it ‘Good morning!’ He is beside himself with terror.\r\n‘Who knows what rich man, what rabbi, what saint, they take me for?\r\nHe will come――and that will be the end of me!’ His terror is such, he\r\nnever even hears the president call out: ‘The case of Bontzye Shweig!’\r\nadding, as he hands the deeds to the advocate, ‘Read, but make haste!’\r\n\r\nThe whole hall goes round and round in Bontzye’s eyes; there is a\r\nrushing in his ears. And through the rushing he hears more and more\r\nclearly the voice of the advocate, speaking sweetly as a violin.\r\n\r\n‘His name’, he hears, ‘fitted him like the dress made for a slender\r\nfigure by the hand of an artist-tailor.’\r\n\r\n‘What is he talking about?’ wondered Bontzye, and he heard an impatient\r\nvoice break in with: ‘No similes, please!’\r\n\r\n‘He never’, continued the advocate, ‘was heard to complain of either\r\nGod or man; there was never a flash of hatred in his eye; he never\r\nlifted it with a claim on heaven.’\r\n\r\nStill Bontzye does not understand, and once again the hard voice\r\ninterrupts: ‘No rhetoric, please!’\r\n\r\n‘Job gave way――this one was more unfortunate.’\r\n\r\n‘Facts, dry facts.’\r\n\r\n‘He kept silent’, the advocate went on, ‘even when his mother died and\r\nhe was given a stepmother at thirteen years old――a serpent, a vixen.’\r\n\r\n‘Can they mean me after all?’ thought Bontzye.\r\n\r\n‘No insinuations against a third party’, said the president, angrily.\r\n\r\n‘She grudged him every mouthful――stale, mouldy bread, tendons instead\r\nof meat――and she drank coffee with cream.’\r\n\r\n‘Keep to the subject’, ordered the president.\r\n\r\n‘She grudged him everything but her finger-nails, and his black\r\nand blue body showed through the holes in his torn and fusty clothes.\r\nWinter time, in the hardest frost, he had to chop wood for her,\r\nbarefoot in the yard; and his hands were too young and too weak, the\r\nlogs too thick, the hatchet too blunt. But he kept silent, even to his\r\nfather.’\r\n\r\n‘To that drunkard?’ laughs the accuser, and Bontzye feels cold in every\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\n‘And always alone’, he continued; ‘no playmates, no school, nor\r\nteaching of any kind――never a whole garment――never a free moment.’\r\n\r\n‘Facts, please!’ reminded the president.\r\n\r\n‘He kept silent even later, when his father seized him by the hair\r\nin a fit of drunkenness and flung him out into the street on a snowy\r\nwinter’s night. He quietly picked himself up out of the snow and ran\r\nwhither his feet carried him. He kept silent all the way to the great\r\ntown――however hungry he might be, he only begged with his eyes. Bathed\r\nin a cold sweat, crushed under heavy loads, his empty stomach convulsed\r\nwith hunger――he kept silent. Bespattered with mud, spat at, driven with\r\nhis load off the pavement and into the road among the cabs, carts, and\r\ntramways, looking death in the eyes every moment. He never calculated\r\nthe difference between other people’s lot and his own――he kept silent.\r\nAnd he never insisted loudly on his pay; he stood in the doorway like\r\na beggar, with a dog-like pleading in his eyes――‘Come again later!’ and\r\nhe went like a shadow to come again later, and beg for his wage more\r\nhumbly than before. He kept silent even when they cheated him of part,\r\nor threw in a false coin.\r\n\r\n‘He took everything in silence.’\r\n\r\n‘They mean me after all’, thought Bontzye.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n‘Once’, continued the advocate, after a sip of water, ‘a change came\r\ninto his life: there came flying along a carriage on rubber tires,\r\ndrawn by two runaway horses. The driver already lay some distance off\r\non the pavement with a cracked skull, the terrified horses foamed at\r\nthe mouth, sparks shot from their hoofs, their eyes shone like fiery\r\nlamps on a winter’s night――and in the carriage, more dead than alive,\r\nsat a man.\r\n\r\n‘And Bontzye stopped the horses. And the man he had saved was a\r\ncharitable Jew who was not ungrateful. He put the dead man’s whip into\r\nBontzye’s hands, and Bontzye became a coachman. More than that, he was\r\nprovided with a wife. And Bontzye kept silent!’\r\n\r\n‘Me, they mean me!’ Bontzye assured himself again, and yet had not the\r\ncourage to give a glance at the Heavenly Court.\r\n\r\nHe listens to the advocate further:\r\n\r\n‘He kept silent also when his protector became bankrupt and did not pay\r\nhim his wages. He kept silent when his wife ran away from him.’\r\n\r\n‘Me, they mean me!’ Now he is sure of it.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\n‘He kept silent even’, began the angelic advocate once more in a still\r\nsofter and sadder voice, ‘when the same philanthropist paid all his\r\ncreditors their due but him――and even when (riding once again in a\r\ncarriage with rubber tires and fiery horses) he knocked Bontzye down\r\nand drove over him. He kept silent even in the hospital, where one may\r\ncry out. He kept silent when the doctor would not come to his bedside\r\nwithout being paid fifteen kopeks, and when the attendant demanded\r\nanother five――for changing his linen.\r\n\r\n‘He kept silent in the death struggle――silent in death.\r\n\r\n‘Not a word against God; not a word against men!\r\n\r\n‘Dixi!’\r\n\r\nOnce more Bontzye trembled all over. He knew that after the advocate\r\ncomes the prosecutor. Who knows what he will say? Bontzye himself\r\nremembered nothing of his life. Even in the other world he forgot every\r\nmoment what had happened in the one before. The advocate had recalled\r\neverything to his mind. Who knows what the prosecutor will not remind\r\nhim of?\r\n\r\n‘Gentlemen’, begins the prosecutor, in a voice biting and acid as\r\nvinegar――but he breaks off.\r\n\r\n‘Gentlemen’, he begins again, but his voice is milder, and a second\r\ntime he breaks off.\r\n\r\nThen from out the same throat comes in a voice that is almost gentle:\r\n‘Gentlemen! He was silent! I will be silent too!’\r\n\r\nThere is a hush――and there sounds in front a new, soft, trembling voice:\r\n‘Bontzye, my child!’ It speaks like a harp. ‘My dear child, Bontzye!’\r\n\r\nAnd Bontzye’s heart melts within him. Now he would lift up his eyes,\r\nbut they are blinded with tears; he never felt such sweet emotion\r\nbefore. ‘My child! Bontzye!’――no one, since his mother died, had spoken\r\nto him with such words in such a voice.\r\n\r\n‘My child’, continues the presiding judge, ‘you have suffered and kept\r\nsilent; there is no whole limb, no whole bone in your body without a\r\nscar, without a wound, not a fibre of your soul that has not bled――and\r\nyou kept silent. There they did not understand. Perhaps you yourself\r\ndid not know that you might have cried out, and that at your cry\r\nthe walls of Jericho would have shaken and fallen. You yourself knew\r\nnothing of your hidden power.\r\n\r\n‘In the other world your silence was not understood, but that is the\r\nWorld of Delusion; in the World of Truth you will receive your reward.\r\nThe Heavenly Court will not judge you; the Heavenly Court will not pass\r\nsentence on you; they will not apportion you a reward. Take what you\r\nwill! Everything is yours.’\r\n\r\nBontzye looks up for the first time. He is dazzled; everything shines\r\nand flashes and streams with light.\r\n\r\n‘_Taki_――really?’ he asks, shyly.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, really!’ answers the presiding judge, with decision; ‘really,\r\nI tell you, everything is yours; everything in heaven belongs to you.\r\nBecause all that shines and sparkles is only the reflection of your\r\nhidden goodness, a reflection of your soul. You only take of what is\r\nyours.’\r\n\r\n‘_Taki?_’ asks Bontzye again, this time in a firmer voice.\r\n\r\n‘_Taki!_ taki! taki!’ they answer from all sides.\r\n\r\n‘Well, if it is so’, Bontzye smiles, ‘I would like to have every day,\r\nfor breakfast, a hot roll with fresh butter.’\r\n\r\nThe Court and the angels looked down, a little ashamed; the prosecutor\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n                                                J.

It is this kind\r\nof assimilation, with the terrible consequences indicated, that I dread\r\nmost――even more than pogroms.\r\n\r\nIt _is_ a tragedy to see a great, ancient people, distinguished for\r\nits loyalty to its religion, and its devotion to its sacred Law, losing\r\nthousands every day by the mere process of attrition. It _is_ a tragedy\r\nto see a language held sacred by all the world, in which Holy Writ was\r\ncomposed, which served as the depository of Israel’s greatest and best\r\nthoughts, doomed to oblivion. It _is_ a tragedy to see the descendants\r\nof those who revealed religion to the world, and who developed the\r\ngreatest religious literature in existence, so little familiar with\r\nreal Jewish thought that they have no other interpretation to offer\r\nof Israel’s Scriptures, Israel’s religion, and Israel’s ideals and\r\naspirations and hopes, than those suggested by their natural opponents,\r\nslavishly following their opinions, copying their phrases, and\r\nrepeating their catchwords. I am not accusing anybody. I am only\r\nstating facts. We are helpless spectators of the Jewish soul wasting\r\naway before our very eyes.\r\n\r\nNow, the rebirth of Israel’s national consciousness and the revival\r\nof Judaism are inseparable. When Israel found itself, it found its\r\nGod. When Israel lost itself, or began to work at its self-effacement,\r\nit was sure to deny its God. The selection of Israel, the\r\nindestructibility of God’s covenant with Israel, the immortality of\r\nIsrael as a nation, and the final restoration of Israel to Palestine,\r\nwhere the nation will live a holy life, on holy ground, with all the\r\nwide-reaching consequences of the conversion of humanity, and the\r\nestablishment of the Kingdom of God on earth――all these are the common\r\nideals and the common ideas that permeate the whole of Jewish\r\nliterature extending over nearly four thousand years.\r\n\r\n                                                   S.

But this was a mere passing\r\nphase, a temporary loss of consciousness. The prophetic spirit cannot\r\nbe crushed, except for a time. It comes to life again, and masters\r\nthe Prophet in his own despite. So, too, the prophetic People regained\r\nconsciousness in its own despite. The Spirit that called Moses\r\nthousands of years ago and sent him on his mission, against his own\r\nwill, now calls again the generation of to-day, saying, ‘_And that\r\nwhich cometh into your mind shall not be at all; in that ye say, We\r\nwill be as the nations ... As I live, saith the Lord God, surely with\r\na mighty hand ... will I be king over you._’\r\n\r\n                                                  ACHAD HA’AM, 1904.\r\n                                                (_Trans. Leon Simon._)\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE VALLEY OF DRY BONES\r\n\r\nTHE hand of the Lord was upon me, and the Lord carried me out in a\r\nspirit, and set me down in the midst of the valley, and it was full of\r\nbones; and He caused me to pass by them round about, and, behold, there\r\nwere very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. And\r\nHe said unto me: ‘Son of man, can these bones live?’ And I answered:\r\n‘O Lord God, Thou knowest’. Then he said unto me: ‘Prophesy over these\r\nbones, and say unto them: O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord:\r\nThus saith the Lord God unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath\r\nto enter into you, and ye shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you,\r\nand will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put\r\nbreath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.’\r\nSo I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was\r\na noise, and behold a commotion, and the bones came together, bone to\r\nits bone. And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh\r\ncame up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.\r\nThen said He unto me: ‘Prophesy unto the breath, prophesy, son of man,\r\nand say to the breath: Thus saith the Lord God: Come from the four\r\nwinds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.’ So\r\nI prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and\r\nthey lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great host. Then\r\nHe said unto me: ‘Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel;\r\nbehold, they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost: we are\r\nclean cut off. Therefore prophesy, and say unto them: Thus saith the\r\nLord God: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up\r\nout of your graves, O My people; and I will bring you into the Land of\r\nIsrael. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your\r\ngraves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O My people. And\r\nI will put My spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you\r\nin your own land; and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and\r\nperformed it, saith the Lord.’\r\n\r\n                                                     EZEKIEL 37. 1‒14.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PALESTINE\r\n\r\nTHE very name Palestine stirs within us the most elevated sentiments.\r\nThere is no country, no matter how important in itself, to which\r\nsuch sublime memories attach themselves. From our earliest youth,\r\nour imagination, nourished on the sacred traditions of the Hebrew\r\nScriptures, loves to transport itself to those heights where of old\r\npious souls heard in each echo the voice of God, where each stone is a\r\nsymbol of divine revelation, each ruin a monument of divine anger. The\r\nfollowers of three religions turn with veneration towards these ruins\r\nof 2,000 years. All find consolation in that land, some by its memories,\r\nothers by its hopes. Even sceptics are ready to render historic justice\r\nto the great events of which it was the theatre: thus the description\r\nof this land and its story have a palpitating interest for all.\r\n\r\n                                                        S.

The resurrection of the Jewish nation on its\r\nown soil will reopen its sacred fountains of creative energy. Remember\r\nthe days of old. After the proclamation issued by Cyrus, the mass\r\nof the Jewish people still remained in Babylon. All told only 42,000\r\nmen, women, and children took advantage of the king’s proclamation\r\nand followed Ezra back to Zion, the land of their fathers. But compare\r\nthe contribution to civilization made by these men with that of their\r\nbrethren who remained in the Dispersion. The handful of ‘Zionists’ and\r\ntheir descendants, because living on their own soil, changed the entire\r\nfuture of mankind. They edited and collected the Prophets, wrote some\r\nof the fairest portions of the Scriptures, formed the canon of the\r\nBible, and gave the world its monotheistic religions. As in the days\r\nof Cyrus, the overwhelming majority of Jews of to-day will continue\r\nto live where they now are, praying and working in absolute loyalty\r\nfor the land of their birth or adoption, and ever beholding their peace\r\nin its welfare. Only a remnant shall return. But it is the national\r\nrejuvenation of that remnant that will open a new chapter in the annals\r\nof the human spirit.\r\n\r\n                                                    J. H.

Why? Israel alone had the\r\nTorah, and it is that which endowed him with deathlessness. And Israel\r\nwill remain deathless――as long as Israel continues to cling to the\r\nTorah. Without the Torah, Israel’s story will also lose itself in the\r\nsands of the desert, _even on its own soil_.\r\n\r\nThe New Judea must be the spiritual descendant of old Judea, and the\r\nmission of Judea, new or old, is first of all to be Judea.\r\n\r\n                                                    J.

It is\r\nIsrael that has brought us the message that God is our Father. It is\r\nIsrael who, in bringing us the divine law, has laid the foundation of\r\nliberty. It is Israel who had the first free institutions the world\r\never saw. It is Israel who has brought us our Bible, our prophets,\r\nour apostles. When sometimes our own unchristian prejudices flame out\r\nagainst the Jewish people, let us remember that all that we have and\r\nall that we are we owe, under God, to what Judaism has given us.\r\n\r\n                                                         LYMAN ABBOTT.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAT a time when the deepest night of inhumanity covered the rest of\r\nmankind, the religion of Israel breathed forth a spirit of love and\r\nbrotherhood which must fill even the stranger, if he be only willing\r\nto see, with reverence and admiration. Israel has given the world true\r\nhumanitarianism, just as it has given the world the true God.\r\n\r\n                                                  C. H. CORNILL, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ISRAEL AND HIS REVELATION\r\n\r\nTHE religion of the Bible is well said to be _revealed_, because the\r\ngreat natural truth, that ‘righteousness tendeth to life’, is seized\r\nand exhibited there with such incomparable force and efficacy. All, or\r\nvery nearly all, the nations of mankind have recognized the importance\r\nof conduct, and have attributed to it a natural obligation. They,\r\nhowever, looked at conduct, not as something full of happiness and joy,\r\nbut as something one could not manage to do without. But ‘Zion heard\r\nof it and rejoiced, and the daughters of Judah were _glad_, because of\r\nthy judgements, O Eternal!’ Happiness is our being’s end and aim, and\r\nno one has ever come near Israel in feeling, and in making others feel,\r\nthat to righteousness belongs happiness! As long as the world lasts,\r\nall who want to make progress in righteousness will come to Israel for\r\ninspiration, as to the people who have had the sense for righteousness\r\nmost glowing and strongest.\r\n\r\nThis does truly constitute for Israel a most extra-ordinary distinction.\r\n‘God hath given commandment to bless, and He hath blessed, and we\r\ncannot reverse it; He hath not seen iniquity in Jacob, and He hath not\r\nseen perverseness in Israel; the Eternal, his God, is with him.’\r\n\r\n                                                 MATTHEW ARNOLD, 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ISRAEL, GREECE, AND ROME[38]\r\n\r\nFOR a philosophic mind there are not more than three histories of real\r\ninterest in the past of humanity: Greek history, the history of Israel,\r\nand Roman history.\r\n\r\nGreece has an exceptional past. Our science, our arts, our\r\nliterature, our philosophy, our political code, our maritime law,\r\nare of Greek origin. The framework of human culture created by Greece\r\nis susceptible of indefinite enlargement. Greece had only one thing\r\nwanting in the circle of her moral and intellectual activity, but this\r\nwas an important void; she despised the humble and did not feel the\r\nneed of a just God. Her philosophers, while dreaming of the immortality\r\nof the soul, were tolerant towards the iniquities of this world. Her\r\nreligions were merely elegant municipal playthings.\r\n\r\n... Israel’s sages burned with anger over the abuses of the world.\r\nThe prophets were fanatics in the cause of social justice, and loudly\r\nproclaimed that if the world was not just, or capable of becoming so,\r\nit had better be destroyed――a view which, if utterly wrong, led to\r\ndeeds of heroism and brought about a grand awakening of the forces of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nOne other great humanizing force had to be created――a force powerful\r\nenough to beat down the obstacles which local patriotism offered to\r\nthe idealistic propaganda of Greece and Judea. Rome fulfilled this\r\nextraordinary function. Force is not a pleasant thing to contemplate,\r\nand the recollections of Rome will never have the powerful attraction\r\nof the affairs of Greece and of Israel; but Roman history is none the\r\nless part and parcel of these histories, which are the pivot of all the\r\nrest, and which we may call providential.\r\n\r\n                                                   ERNEST RENAN, 1887.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNONE of the resplendent names in history――Egypt, Athens, Rome――can\r\ncompare in eternal grandeur with Jerusalem. For Israel has given to\r\nmankind the category of holiness. Israel alone has known the thirst\r\nfor social justice, and that inner saintliness which is the source of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n                                                 CHARLES WAGNER, 1918.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMONG the theocratic nations of the ancient East, the Hebrews seem to\r\nus as sober men in a world of intoxicated beings. Antiquity, however,\r\nheld _them_ to be the dreamers among waking folk.\r\n\r\n                                                       H. LOTZE, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WHAT IS A JEW?\r\n\r\nWHAT is a Jew? This question is not at all so odd as it seems. Let us\r\nsee what kind of peculiar creature the Jew is, which all the rulers and\r\nall nations have together and separately abused and molested, oppressed\r\nand persecuted, trampled and butchered, burned and hanged――and in spite\r\nof all this is yet alive! What is a Jew, who has never allowed himself\r\nto be led astray by all the earthly possessions which his oppressors\r\nand persecutors constantly offered him in order that he should change\r\nhis faith and forsake his own Jewish religion?\r\n\r\n_The Jew is that sacred being who has brought down from heaven the\r\neverlasting fire, and has illumined with it the entire world. He is the\r\nreligious source, spring, and fountain out of which all the rest of the\r\npeoples have drawn their beliefs and their religions._\r\n\r\n_The Jew is the pioneer of liberty._ Even in those olden days, when\r\nthe people were divided into but two distinct classes, slaves and\r\nmasters――even so long ago had the law of Moses prohibited the practice\r\nof keeping a person in bondage for more than six years.\r\n\r\n_The Jew is the pioneer of civilization._ Ignorance was condemned\r\nin olden Palestine more even than it is to-day in civilized Europe.\r\nMoreover, in those wild and barbarous days, when neither life nor the\r\ndeath of any one counted for anything at all, Rabbi Akiba[39] did not\r\nrefrain from expressing himself openly against capital punishment,\r\na practice which is recognized to-day as a highly civilized way of\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n_The Jew is the emblem of civil and religious toleration._ ‘Love the\r\nstranger and the sojourner’, Moses commands, ‘because you have been\r\nstrangers in the land of Egypt.’ And this was said in those remote\r\nand savage times when the principal ambition of the races and nations\r\nconsisted in crushing and enslaving one another. As concerns religious\r\ntoleration, the Jewish faith is not only far from the missionary spirit\r\nof converting people of other denominations, but on the contrary the\r\nTalmud commands the Rabbis to inform and explain to every one who\r\nwillingly comes to accept the Jewish religion, all the difficulties\r\ninvolved in its acceptance, and to point out to the would-be proselyte\r\nthat the righteous of all nations have a share in immortality. Of such\r\na lofty and ideal religious toleration not even the moralists of our\r\npresent day can boast.\r\n\r\n_The Jew is the emblem of eternity._ He whom neither slaughter nor\r\ntorture of thousands of years could destroy, he whom neither fire nor\r\nsword nor inquisition was able to wipe off from the face of the earth,\r\nhe who was the first to produce the oracles of God, he who has been for\r\nso long the guardian of prophecy, and who transmitted it to the rest of\r\nthe world――such a nation cannot be destroyed. The Jew is everlasting as\r\nis eternity itself.\r\n\r\n                                                          LEO TOLSTOY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE BOOK OF THE AGES[40]\r\n\r\nTHE Bible is the book of the ancient world, the book of the Middle Ages,\r\nand the book of modern times.

Against this gorgeous background we see mankind\r\nstrutting, playing their little part on the stage of history. We see\r\nthem taken from the dust and returning to the dust. We see the rise and\r\nfall of empires, we see great cities, now the hive of busy industry,\r\nnow silent and desolate――a den of wild beasts.

The Bible has been the Magna Charta of the\r\npoor and of the oppressed; down to modern times no State has had a\r\nconstitution in which the interests of the people are so largely taken\r\ninto account, in which the duties so much more than the privileges of\r\nrulers are insisted upon, as that drawn up for Israel in Deuteronomy\r\nand in Leviticus; nowhere is the fundamental truth that the welfare of\r\nthe State, in the long run, depends on the uprightness of the citizen\r\nso strongly laid down.... The Bible is the most democratic book in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n                                                   T. H.

The letters of its books are not to be many, but\r\nthey are to be letters of fire. A language of this sort is not destined\r\nto say much, but what it does is beaten out upon an anvil. It is to\r\npour floods of anger and utter cries of rage against the abuses of the\r\nworld, calling the four winds of heaven to the assault of the citadels\r\nof evil. Like the jubilee horn of the sanctuary it will be put to\r\nno profane use; but it will sound the notes of the holy war against\r\ninjustice and the call of the great assemblies; it will have accents\r\nof rejoicing, and accents of terror; it will become the trumpet of\r\njudgement.\r\n\r\n                                                   ERNEST RENAN, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            REBECCA’S HYMN\r\n\r\n            WHEN Israel, of the Lord beloved,\r\n                Out from the land of bondage came,\r\n            Her fathers’ God before her moved,\r\n                An awful guide in smoke and flame.\r\n            By day, along the astonished lands,\r\n                The cloudy pillar glided slow;\r\n            By night, Arabia’s crimsoned sands\r\n                Returned the fiery column’s glow.\r\n\r\n            There rose the choral hymn of praise,\r\n                And trump and timbrel answered keen,\r\n            And Zion’s daughters poured their lays,\r\n                With priest’s and warrior’s voice between.\r\n            No portents now our foes amaze,\r\n                Forsaken Israel wanders lone;\r\n            Our fathers would not know Thy ways,\r\n                And Thou hast left them to their own.\r\n\r\n            But present still, though now unseen!\r\n                When brightly shines the prosperous day.\r\n            Be thoughts of Thee a cloudy screen\r\n                To temper the deceitful ray.\r\n            And oh, when stoops on Judah’s path\r\n                In shade and storm the frequent night,\r\n            Be Thou, long-suffering, slow to wrath,\r\n                A burning and a shining light!\r\n\r\n            Our harps we left by Babel’s streams,\r\n                The tyrant’s jest, the Gentile’s scorn;\r\n            No censer round our altar beams,\r\n                And mute are timbrel, harp, and horn.\r\n            But Thou hast said, ‘The blood of goat,\r\n                The flesh of rams, I will not prize;\r\n            A contrite heart, a humble thought,\r\n                Are Mine accepted sacrifice’.\r\n\r\n                                    SIR WALTER SCOTT, 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MOSES[43]\r\n\r\nTO lead into freedom a people long crushed by tyranny; to discipline\r\nand order such a mighty host; to harden them into fighting men, before\r\nwhom warlike tribes quailed and walled cities went down; to repress\r\ndiscontent and jealousy and mutiny; to combat reactions and reversions;\r\nto turn the quick, fierce flame of enthusiasm to the service of a\r\nsteady purpose, require some towering character――a character blending\r\nin highest expression the qualities of politician, patriot, philosopher,\r\nand statesman――the union of the wisdom of the Egyptians with the\r\nunselfish devotion of the meekest of men.\r\n\r\nThe striking differences between Egyptian and Hebrew polity are not of\r\nform, but of essence. The tendency of the one is to subordination and\r\noppression; of the other, to individual freedom. Strangest of recorded\r\nbirth! From the strongest and most splendid despotism of antiquity\r\ncomes the freest republic. From between the paws of the rock-hewn\r\nSphinx rises the genius of human liberty, and the trumpets of the\r\nExodus throb with the defiant proclamation of the rights of man.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew commonwealth was based upon the individual――a commonwealth\r\nwhose ideal it was that every man should sit under his own vine and\r\nfig-tree, with none to vex him or make him afraid; a commonwealth in\r\nwhich none should be condemned to ceaseless toil; in which, for even\r\nthe bond slave there should be hope; in which, for even the beast of\r\nburden there should be rest. It is not the protection of property,\r\nbut the protection of humanity, that is the aim of the Mosaic code.\r\nIts Sabbath day and Sabbath year secure, even to the lowliest, rest\r\nand leisure. With the blast of the jubilee trumpets the slave goes\r\nfree, and a re-division of the land secures again to the poorest his\r\nfair share in the bounty of the common Creator. The reaper must leave\r\nsomething for the gleaner; even the ox cannot be muzzled as he treadeth\r\nout the corn. Everywhere, in everything, the dominant idea is that of\r\nour homely phrase――‘Live and let live.’\r\n\r\nThat there is one day in the week that the working man may call his\r\nown, one day in the week on which the hammer is silent and the loom\r\nstands idle, is due, through Christianity, to Judaism――to the code\r\npromulgated in the Sinaitic wilderness. And who that considers the\r\nwaste of productive forces can doubt that modern society would be not\r\nmerely happier, but richer, had we received as well as the Sabbath\r\nday the grand idea of the Sabbath year, or, adapting its spirit to our\r\nchanged conditions, secured in another way an equivalent reduction of\r\nworking hours.\r\n\r\nIt is in these characteristics of the Mosaic institutions that, as\r\nin the fragments of a Colossus, we may read the greatness of the mind\r\nwhose impress they bear――of a mind in advance of its surroundings, in\r\nadvance of its age; of one of those star souls that dwindle not with\r\ndistance, but, glowing with the radiance of essential truth, hold their\r\nlight while institutions and languages and creeds change and pass.\r\n\r\nLeader and servant of men! Law-giver and benefactor! Toiler towards\r\nthe Promised Land seen only by the eye of faith! Type of the high\r\nsouls who in every age have given to earth its heroes and its martyrs,\r\nwhose deeds are the precious possession of the race, whose memories are\r\nits sacred heritage! With whom among the founders of Empire shall we\r\ncompare him?\r\n\r\nTo dispute about the inspiration of such a man were to dispute about\r\nwords. From the depths of the Unseen such characters must draw their\r\nstrength; from fountains that flow only from the pure in heart must\r\ncome their wisdom. Of something more real than matter; of something\r\nhigher than the stars; of a light that will endure when suns are dead\r\nand dark; of a purpose of which the physical universe is but a passing\r\nphrase, such lives tell.\r\n\r\n                                                   HENRY GEORGE, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BURIAL OF MOSES\r\n\r\n              BY Nebo’s lonely mountain,\r\n                  On this side Jordan’s wave,\r\n              In a vale in the land of Moab,\r\n                  There lies a lonely grave.\r\n              But no man built that sepulchre,\r\n                  And no man saw it e’er;\r\n              For the angels of God upturned the sod\r\n                  And laid the dead man there.\r\n\r\n              That was the grandest funeral\r\n                  That ever passed on earth;\r\n              Yet no man heard the trampling,\r\n                  Or saw the train go forth:\r\n              Noiselessly as the daylight\r\n                  Comes when the night is done,\r\n              And the crimson streak on ocean’s cheek\r\n                  Grows into the great sun.\r\n\r\n              Perchance the bald old eagle\r\n                  On grey Beth-peor’s height\r\n              Out of his rocky eyrie\r\n                  Looked on the wondrous sight;\r\n              Perchance the lion stalking\r\n                  Still shuns that hallowed spot;\r\n              For beast and bird have seen and heard\r\n                  That which man knoweth not.\r\n\r\n              This was the bravest warrior\r\n                  That ever buckled sword;\r\n              This the most gifted poet\r\n                  That ever breathed a word;\r\n              And never earth’s philosopher\r\n                  Traced with his golden pen\r\n              On the deathless page truths half so sage\r\n                  As he wrote down for men.\r\n\r\n                                        C.

Every great fact throughout its entire course,\r\nright down to modern times, has left its impress on the Synagogue\r\nliturgy. Jewish poetry is the mirror of Jewish national life, and\r\npoetic utterance a divine instinct of the Jewish mind. For to the\r\nHebrew, poetry was both prayer and praise, and alike in mercy and\r\naffliction the poet’s words became for the Hebrew the medium of direct\r\ncommunion with the Divine. Adoration can rise no higher than we find it\r\nin the Psalter.\r\n\r\n                                                    JOHN E.

So, indeed, it seems to\r\nhave remained through all the centuries――the one body of poetry which\r\nhas gone on, apart from the change of races and languages, speaking\r\nwith a voice of power to the hearts of men.\r\n\r\n                                                    ERNEST RHYS, 1895.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE Psalms resound, and will continue to resound, as long as there\r\nshall be men created in the image of God, in whose hearts the sacred\r\nfire of religion shines and glows; for they are religion itself put\r\ninto speech.\r\n\r\n                                                  C.

The midnight breeze, as it rippled over the strings, made such\r\nmusic that the poet king was constrained to rise from his bed, and till\r\nthe dawn flushed the eastern skies he wedded words to the strains. The\r\npoetry of that tradition is condensed in the saying that the Book of\r\nPsalms contains the whole music of the heart of man, swept by the hand\r\nof his Maker. In it are gathered the lyrical burst of his tenderness,\r\nthe moan of his penitence, the pathos of his sorrow, the triumph of his\r\nvictory, the despair of his defeat, the firmness of his confidence, the\r\nrapture of his assured hope.\r\n\r\nThe Psalms express in exquisite words the kinship which every\r\nthoughtful human heart craves to find with a supreme, unchanging,\r\nloving God, who will be to him a protector, guardian, and friend. They\r\ntranslate into speech the spiritual passion of the loftiest genius;\r\nthey also utter, with the beauty born of truth and simplicity, the\r\ninarticulate and humble longings of the unlettered peasant. They alone\r\nhave known no limitations to a particular age, country, or form of\r\nfaith. In the Psalms the vast hosts of suffering humanity have found\r\nthe deepest expression of their hopes and fears.\r\n\r\n                                                 R. E.

In modern times\r\nwe hardly like to acknowledge the full force of their words, lest they\r\nshould prove subversive to society. And so we explain them away or\r\nspiritualize them, and convert what is figurative into what is literal,\r\nand what is literal into what is figurative. And still, after all our\r\ninterpretation or misinterpretation, whether due to a false theology or\r\nan imperfect knowledge of the original language, the force of the words\r\nremains, and a light of heavenly truth and love streams from them even\r\nnow more than 2,500 years after they were first uttered.\r\n\r\n                                                      BENJAMIN JOWETT.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nONE lesson, and only one, history may be said to repeat with\r\ndistinctness, that the world is built somehow on moral foundations;\r\nthat in the long run it is well with the good; in the long run it is\r\nill with the wicked.

FROUDE, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BOOK OF JONAH.\r\n\r\nAN involuntary smile passes over one’s features at the mention of the\r\nname of Jonah. For the popular conception sees nothing in this book but\r\na silly tale exciting us to derision. I have read the Book of Jonah at\r\nleast a hundred times, and I will publicly avow that I cannot even now\r\ntake up this marvellous book, nay, nor even speak of it, without the\r\ntears rising to my eyes and my heart beating higher. This apparently\r\ntrivial book is one of the deepest and grandest that was ever written,\r\nand I should like to say to every one who approaches it, ‘Take off thy\r\nshoes, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground’.\r\n\r\nJonah receives from God the command to go to Nineveh to proclaim the\r\njudgement, but he rose to flee from the presence of the Lord by ship\r\nunto Tarshish in the far west. From the very beginning of the narrative,\r\nthe genuine and loyal devotion of the heathen seamen is placed in\r\nintentional and exceedingly powerful contrast to the behaviour of the\r\nprophet――they are the sincere believers: he is the only heathen on\r\nboard. After Jonah has been saved from storm and sea by the fish, he\r\nagain receives the command to go to Nineveh. He obeys; and, wonderful\r\nto relate, scarcely has the strange preacher traversed the third part\r\nof the city crying out his warning, than the whole of Nineveh proclaim\r\na fast and put on sackcloth. The people of Nineveh believed the words\r\nof the preacher and humiliated themselves before God; therefore, the\r\nground and motive of the Divine judgement ceased to exist: ‘God\r\nrepented of the evil that He thought to do them, and He did it not’.\r\nNow comes the fourth chapter, on account of which the whole book was\r\nwritten, and which cannot be replaced by paraphrase.\r\n\r\n‘But it’ [i.e. God’s determining not to destroy Nineveh because of its\r\nsincere repentance] ‘displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.\r\nAnd he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not\r\nthis my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to\r\nflee unto Tarshish: for I knew that Thou art a gracious God, and full\r\nof compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and repentest\r\nThee of the evil. Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech Thee, my life\r\nfrom me; for it is better for me to die than to live. And the Lord said,\r\nDoest thou well to be angry? Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat\r\non the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under\r\nit in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. And\r\nthe Lord God prepared a gourd and made it to come up over Jonah, that\r\nit might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his evil case.\r\nSo Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the gourd. But God prepared\r\na worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that\r\nit withered. And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared\r\na sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he\r\nfainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is\r\nbetter for me to die than to live. And God said to Jonah, Doest thou\r\nwell to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry even\r\nunto death. And the Lord said, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the\r\nwhich thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in\r\na night and perished in a night; and should not I have pity on Nineveh,\r\nthat great city; wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that\r\ncannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also\r\nmuch cattle’?\r\n\r\nWith this question the book closes. More simply, as something quite\r\nself-evident, and therefore more sublimely and touchingly, the truth\r\nwas never spoken in the Hebrew Scriptures that God, as Creator of the\r\nwhole earth, must also be the God and Father of the entire world, in\r\nwhose loving, kind, and fatherly heart all men are equal, before whom\r\nthere is no difference of nation and creed, but only men, whom He has\r\ncreated in His own image.[45]\r\n\r\n                                                  C.

WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE TALMUD[47]\r\n\r\nTHE Talmud, which was as a second life to the men of the Ghetto,\r\nwas not only a book of philosophy or devotion, it was a reservoir\r\nof national life; it was the faithful mirror of the civilization of\r\nBabylon and Judea, and, at the same time, a magical phantasmagoria of\r\nall the wild dreams, the fables, the legends, the scraps of science\r\nmore or less exact, the reveries, the audacious theories discovered by\r\nthe Wandering Jew in his endless travels. Every generation of Judaism\r\nhad accumulated its facts and fancies there. Even the Bible itself did\r\nnot come so close to the daily life of the Ghetto as the Talmud and the\r\nMishna. The Bible was a thing eternal, apart, unchanging. The Talmud\r\nwas a daily companion, living, breathing, contemporary, with a hundred\r\nremedies for a hundred needs. A nation persecuted, lives through its\r\ntime of stress rather by its commentaries than by its Scriptures.\r\nIn the Ghetto the Talmud was a door into the ideal always open. When\r\nthe Christians burned the Jews they did no enduring harm to Judaism,\r\nfor martyrdom purifies and strengthens every cause. But when they\r\nsequestrated every copy of the Talmud that fraud or force could\r\ndiscover, and burned the spiritual bread of a devoted people upon\r\nthe public square, they committed an irreparable injury; for, by\r\nwithdrawing its ideal, they debased the population of the Ghetto.\r\n\r\n                                            A. MARY F. ROBINSON, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE HUMANITY OF JEWISH WISDOM\r\n\r\nIN my early youth I read――I have forgotten where――the words of the\r\nancient Jewish sage――Hillel, if I remember rightly: ‘If thou art not\r\nfor thyself, who will be for thee? But if thou art for thyself alone,\r\nwherefore art thou’?[48]\r\n\r\nThe inner meaning of these words impressed me with its profound wisdom,\r\nand I interpreted them for myself in this manner: I must actively take\r\ncare of myself, that my life should be better, and I must not impose\r\nthe care of myself on other people’s shoulders; but if I am going to\r\ntake care of myself alone, of nothing but my own personal life, it will\r\nbe useless, ugly, meaningless. This thought ate its way deep into my\r\nsoul, and I say now with conviction: Hillel’s wisdom served as a strong\r\nstaff on my road, which was neither even nor easy.\r\n\r\nI believe that Jewish wisdom is more all-human and universal than\r\nany other; and this not only because of its immemorial age, not\r\nonly because it is the firstborn, but also because of the powerful\r\nhumaneness that saturates it, because of its high estimate of man.\r\n\r\n                                                    MAXIM GORKY, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PHARISEES[49]\r\n\r\nOF all the strange ironies of history, perhaps the strangest is that\r\n‘Pharisee’ is current as a term of reproach among the theological\r\ndescendants of that sect of Nazarenes who, without the martyr spirit\r\nof those primitive Puritans, would never have come into existence.\r\n\r\n                                                         T.

The Pharisees consistently strove to bring\r\nlife more and more under the dominion of religious observance. By\r\ncarefully formed habits, by the ceremonial of religious observances,\r\nreligious ideas and sanctions could be impressed upon the people’s mind\r\nand heart. But the outward was subordinated to the inward.\r\n\r\n                                                CANON G. H.

For there has seldom been\r\nfor Christians the opportunity to know what Pharisaism really meant,\r\nand perhaps still more seldom the desire to use that opportunity.\r\nIs then the Christian religion so weak that it must be advocated by\r\nblackening the character of its oldest rival?\r\n\r\n                                             R. TRAVERS HERFORD, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE JEWISH PRAYER BOOK\r\n\r\nWHEN we come to view the half-dozen or so great Liturgies of the world\r\npurely as religious documents, and to weigh their value as devotional\r\nclassics, the incomparable superiority of the Jewish convincingly\r\nappears. The Jewish Liturgy occupies its pages with the One Eternal\r\nLord; holds ever true, confident, and direct speech with Him; exhausts\r\nthe resources of language in songs of praise, in utterances of loving\r\ngratitude, in rejoicing at His nearness, in natural outpourings of\r\ngrief for sin; never so much as a dream of intercessors or of hidings\r\nfrom His blessed punishments; and, withal, such a sweet sense of the\r\ndivine accessibility every moment to each sinful, suffering child of\r\nearth. Where shall one find a hymn of universal faith like the Adon\r\nOlam, of mystical beauty like the Hymn of Glory[50]; or services so\r\nsolemn, touching, and tender as those appointed for Yom Kippur? Compare\r\nthe misery, gloom, and introspection surrounding other requiem and\r\nfuneral services, with the chastened, dignified sobriety of the Hebrew\r\nprayer for the dying,[51] and the healthy, cheerful manliness of the\r\nMourner’s Kaddish.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is most refreshing silence in regard to life-conditions\r\nafter death. Neither is there any spiteful condemnation of the\r\nfollowers of other faiths; the Jew is singularly free from narrow\r\nintolerance.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Jew has cause to thank God, and the fathers before him,\r\nfor the noblest Liturgy the annals of faith can show.\r\n\r\n                                                   G. E. BIDDLE, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          IN A SYNAGOGUE[52]\r\n\r\nDERONDA gave himself up to that strongest effect of chanted liturgies\r\nwhich is independent of detailed verbal meaning. The most powerful\r\nmovement of feeling with a liturgy is the prayer which seeks for\r\nnothing special, but is a yearning to escape from the limitations\r\nof our own weakness and an invocation of all Good to enter and abide\r\nwith us; or else a self-oblivious lifting up of gladness, a ‘Gloria in\r\nexcelsis’ that such Good exists; both the yearning and the exultation\r\ngathering their utmost force from the sense of communion in a form\r\nwhich has expressed them both for long generations of struggling\r\nfellow-men. The Hebrew liturgy, like others, has its transitions of\r\nlitany, lyric proclamation, dry statement, and blessing; but this\r\nevening all were one for Deronda; the chant of the Chazan’s or Reader’s\r\ngrand wide-ranging voice with its passage from monotony to sudden\r\ncries, the outburst of sweet boys’ voices from the little choir, the\r\ndevotional swaying of men’s bodies backwards and forwards, the very\r\ncommonness of the building and shabbiness of the scene where a national\r\nfaith, which had penetrated the thinking of half the world, had moulded\r\nthe splendid forms of that world’s religion, was finding a remote,\r\nobscure echo――all were blent for him as one expression of a binding\r\nhistory, tragic and yet glorious.\r\n\r\n                                                   GEORGE ELIOT, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE TORCH OF JEWISH LEARNING[53]\r\n\r\nLEARNING was for two thousand years the sole claim to distinction\r\nrecognized by Israel. ‘The scholar’, says the Talmud, ‘takes precedence\r\nover the king.’ Israel remained faithful to this precept throughout\r\nall her humiliations. Whenever, in Christian or Moslem lands, a hostile\r\nhand closed her schools, the rabbis crossed the seas to reopen their\r\nacademies in a distant country. Like the legendary Wandering Jew,\r\nthe flickering torch of Jewish scholarship thus passed from East to\r\nWest, from North to South, changing every two or three hundred years\r\nfrom one country to another. Whenever a royal edict commanded them to\r\nleave, within three months, the country in which their fathers had been\r\nburied and their sons had been born, the treasure which the Jews were\r\nmost anxious to carry away with them was their books. Among all the\r\n_autos-da-fé_ which the daughter of Zion has had to witness, none has\r\ncost her such bitter tears as those flames which, during the Middle\r\nAges, greedily consumed the scrolls of the Talmud.\r\n\r\n                                              A. LEROY BEAULIEU, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DURING THE CRUSADES[54]\r\n\r\nIN the little town Tiberias, on the shore of the Lake of Gennesaret,\r\nsat the old Jew Eleazar, with his family, prepared to celebrate the\r\nPassover. It was the fourteenth day of the month Nisan of the year 1089.\r\n\r\nAfter the head of the family had washed his hands, he blessed the gifts\r\nof God, drank some wine, took some of the bitter herbs, and ate and\r\ngave to the others. After that, the second cup of wine was served, and\r\nthe youngest son of the house asked, according to the sacred custom,\r\n‘What is the meaning of this feast?’\r\n\r\nThe father answered: ‘The Lord brought us with a strong hand out of\r\nthe Egyptian bondage’. Thereafter a blessing was pronounced on the\r\nunleavened bread, and they sat down to eat. The old Eleazar spoke of\r\npast times, and contrasted them with the present: ‘Man born of woman\r\nlives but a short time, and is full of trouble; he cometh up like a\r\nflower, and is cut down; he fleeth hence like a shadow, and continueth\r\nnot. A stranger and a sojourner is he upon earth, and therefore he\r\nshould be always ready for his journey as we are, this holy evening.’\r\n\r\nThe eldest son, Jacob, who had come home in the evening after a journey,\r\nseemed to wish to say something, but did not venture to do so till the\r\nfourth and last cup was drunk.\r\n\r\n‘Now, Jacob’, said Eleazar, ‘you want to talk. You come from a journey,\r\nthough somewhat late, and have something new to tell us. Hush! I hear\r\nsteps in the garden!’\r\n\r\nAll hurried to the window, for they lived in troublous times; but, as\r\nno one was to be seen outside, they sat down again at the table.\r\n\r\n‘Speak, Jacob’, Eleazar said again.\r\n\r\n‘I come from Antioch, where the Crusaders are besieged by Kerboga, the\r\nEmir Mosul. Famine has raged among them, and of three hundred thousand\r\nGoyim, only twenty thousand remain.’\r\n\r\n‘What had they to do here?’\r\n\r\n‘Now, on the roads, they are talking of a new battle which the Goyim\r\nhave won, and they believe that the Crusaders will march straight on\r\nJerusalem.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, they won’t come here.’\r\n\r\n‘They won’t find the way, unless there are traitors.’\r\n\r\n‘The Christians are misguided, and their doctrine is folly. They\r\nbelieve the Messiah has come, although the world is like a hell, and\r\nmen resemble devils! And it ever gets worse....’\r\n\r\nThen the door was flung open, and on the threshold appeared a little\r\nman, emaciated as a skeleton, with burning eyes――Peter the Hermit.\r\nHe was clothed in rags, carried a cross in his hands, and bore a red\r\ncross-shaped sign on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n‘Are you Christians?’ he asked.\r\n\r\n‘No’, answered Eleazar, ‘we are of Israel.’\r\n\r\n‘Out with you!――down to the lake and be baptized, or you will die the\r\ndeath!’\r\n\r\nThen Eleazar turned to the Hermit, and cried, ‘No! I and my house will\r\nserve the Lord, as we have done this holy evening according to the law\r\nof our fathers. We suffer for our sins, that is true, but you, godless,\r\ncursed man, pride not yourself on your power, for you have not yet\r\nescaped the judgement of Almighty God.’\r\n\r\nThe Hermit had gone out to his followers. Those within the house closed\r\nthe window-shutters and the door.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry without: ‘Fire the house!’\r\n\r\n‘Let us bless God, and die!’ said Eleazar, and none of them hesitated.\r\nEleazar spoke: ‘I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He will stand\r\nat the latter day upon the earth. And when I am free from my flesh, I\r\nshall see God. Him shall I see and not another, and for that my soul\r\nand my heart cry out.’\r\n\r\nThe mother had taken the youngest son in her arms, as though she wished\r\nto protect him against the fire which now seized on the wall.\r\n\r\nThen Eleazar began the Song of the Three Children[55] in the fire, and\r\nwhen they came to the words,\r\n\r\n                 ‘O thank the Lord, for He is good,\r\n                  And His mercy endureth for ever’,\r\n\r\ntheir voices were choked, and they ended their days like the Maccabees.\r\n\r\n                                              AUGUST STRINDBERG, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE EXPULSION FROM SPAIN AND PORTUGAL, 1492‒1497[56]\r\n\r\nTHE persecution of the Jewish race dates from the very earliest period\r\nin which Christianity obtained the direction of the civil powers; and\r\nthe hatred of the Jews was for many centuries a faithful index of the\r\npiety of the Christians.\r\n\r\nInsulted, plundered, hated, and despised by all Christian nations,\r\nbanished from England by Edward I, and from France by Charles VI,\r\nthey found in the Spanish Moors rulers who were probably not without\r\na special sympathy for a race whose pure monotheism formed a marked\r\ncontrast to the scarcely disguised polytheism of the Spanish Catholics;\r\nand Jewish learning and Jewish genius contributed very largely to\r\nthat bright but transient civilization which radiated from Toledo\r\nand Cordova, and exercised so salutary an influence upon the belief\r\nof Europe. But when, in an ill-omened hour, the Cross supplanted the\r\nCrescent on the heights of the Alhambra, this solitary refuge was\r\ndestroyed, the last gleam of tolerance vanished from Spain, and the\r\nexpulsion of the Jews was determined.\r\n\r\nThis edict was immediately due to the exertions of Torquemada; but\r\nits ultimate cause is to be found in that steadily increasing popular\r\nfanaticism which made it impossible for the two races to exist together.\r\nIn 1390, about a hundred years before the conquest of Granada, the\r\nCatholics of Seville being excited by the eloquence of a great preacher,\r\nnamed Hernando Martinez, had attacked the Jews’ quarter, and murdered\r\n4,000 Jews, Martinez himself presiding over the massacre. About a year\r\nlater, and partly through the influence of the same eminent divine,\r\nsimilar scenes took place at Valentia, Cordova, Burgos, Toledo, and\r\nBarcelona ... and more than once during the fifteenth century. At\r\nlast the Moorish war, which had always been regarded as a crusade, was\r\ndrawing to a close, the religious fervour of the Spanish rose to the\r\nhighest point, and the Inquisition was established as its expression.\r\nNumbers of converted Jews were massacred; others, who had been baptized\r\nduring past explosions of popular fury, fled to the Moors, in order to\r\npractise their rites, and at last, after a desperate resistance, were\r\ncaptured and burnt alive. The clergy exerted all their energies to\r\nproduce the expulsion of the entire race, and to effect this object all\r\nthe old calumnies were revived, and two or three miracles invented.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that history relates very few measures that\r\nproduced so vast an amount of calamity. In three short months, all\r\nunconverted Jews were obliged, under pain of death, to abandon the\r\nSpanish soil. Multitudes, falling into the hands of the pirates, who\r\nswarmed around the coast, were plundered of all they possessed and\r\nreduced to slavery; multitudes died of famine or of plague, or were\r\nmurdered or tortured with horrible cruelty by the African savages.\r\nAbout 80,000 took refuge in Portugal, relying on the promise of the\r\nking. Spanish priests lashed the Portuguese into fury, and the king\r\nwas persuaded to issue an edict which threw even that of Isabella into\r\nthe shade. All the adult Jews were banished from Portugal; but first\r\nof all their children below the age of fourteen were taken from them\r\nto be educated as Christians. Then, indeed, the cup of bitterness was\r\nfilled to the brim. The serene fortitude with which the exiled people\r\nhad borne so many and such grievous calamities gave way, and was\r\nreplaced by the wildest paroxysms of despair. When at last, childless\r\nand broken-hearted, they sought to leave the land, they found that\r\nthe ships had been purposely detained, and the allotted time, having\r\nexpired, they were reduced to slavery and baptized by force. A great\r\npeal of rejoicing filled the Peninsula, and proclaimed that the triumph\r\nof the Spanish priests was complete.\r\n\r\nCertainly the heroism of the defenders of every other creed fades into\r\ninsignificance before this martyr people, who for thirteen centuries\r\nconfronted all the evils that the fiercest fanaticism could devise,\r\nenduring obloquy and spoliation and the violation of the dearest ties,\r\nand the infliction of the most hideous sufferings, rather than abandon\r\ntheir faith.\r\n\r\nPersecution came to the Jewish nation in its most horrible forms, yet\r\nsurrounded by every circumstance of petty annoyance that could destroy\r\nits grandeur, and it continued for centuries their abiding portion. But\r\nabove all this the genius of that wonderful people rose supreme. While\r\nthose around them were grovelling in the darkness of besotted ignorance;\r\nwhile juggling miracles and lying relics were the themes on which\r\nalmost all Europe was expatiating; while the intellect of Christendom,\r\nenthralled by countless superstitions, had sunk into a deadly torpor,\r\nin which all love of inquiry and all search for truth were abandoned,\r\nthe Jews were still pursuing the path of knowledge, amassing learning,\r\nand stimulating progress with the same unflinching constancy that they\r\nmanifested in their faith. They were the most skilful physicians, the\r\nablest financiers, and among the most profound philosophers.\r\n\r\n                                                 W. E. H. LECKY, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A PROTEST AGAINST THE AUTO-DA-FÉ\r\n                     OF SEPTEMBER 20, 1761, LISBON\r\n\r\nWHAT was their crime? Only that they were born. They were born\r\nIsraelites, they celebrated Pesach; that is the only reason that the\r\nPortuguese burnt them. Would you believe that while the flames were\r\nconsuming these innocent victims, the inquisitors and the other savages\r\nwere chanting _our_ prayers? These pitiless monsters were invoking\r\nthe God of mercy and kindness, the God of pardon, while committing\r\nthe most atrocious and barbarous crime, while acting in a way which\r\ndemons in their rage would not use against their brother demons.\r\nYour madness goes so far as to say that we are scattered because our\r\nfathers condemned to death him whom you worship. O ye pious tigers,\r\nye fanatical panthers, who despise your sect so much that you have no\r\nbetter way of supporting it than by executioners, cannot you see that\r\nit was only the Romans who condemned him? We had not, at that time, the\r\nright to inflict death; we were governed by Quirinus, Varus, Pilate.\r\nNo crucifixion was practised among us. Not a trace of that form of\r\npunishment is to be found. Cease, therefore, to punish a whole nation\r\nfor an event for which it cannot be responsible. Would it be just to\r\ngo and burn the Pope and all the Monsignori at Rome to-day because the\r\nfirst Romans ravished the Sabines and pillaged the Samnites?\r\n\r\nO God, who hast created us all, who desirest not the misfortune of Thy\r\ncreatures, God, Father of all, God of mercy, accomplish Thou that there\r\nbe no longer on this globe, on this least of all the worlds, either\r\nfanatics or persecutors. Amen.\r\n\r\n                                               F. M. A.

England became the\r\npeople of a book, and that book was the Bible. It was read in churches,\r\nand it was read at home, and everywhere its words, as they fell on\r\nears which custom had not deadened to their force and beauty, kindled\r\na startling enthusiasm. As a mere literary monument, the English\r\nVersion of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English tongue,\r\nwhile its perpetual use made it from the instant of its appearance the\r\nstandard of our language. But far greater than its effect on literature\r\nwas the effect of the Bible on the character of the people at large.\r\nElizabeth might silence or tune the pulpits, but it was impossible\r\nfor her to silence or tune the great preachers of justice, and mercy,\r\nand truth, who spoke from the Book which the Lord again opened to the\r\npeople. The effect of the Bible in this way was simply amazing. The\r\nwhole temper of the nation was changed. A new conception of life and\r\nof man superseded the old. A new moral and religious impulse spread\r\nthrough every class.\r\n\r\n                                                    J. R. GREEN, 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FOR THE EMANCIPATION OF THE JEWS\r\n\r\nIN the infancy of civilization, when our island was as savage as\r\nNew Guinea, when letters and arts were still unknown to Athens, when\r\nscarcely a thatched hut stood on what was afterwards the site of Rome,\r\nthis contemned people had their fenced cities and cedar palaces, their\r\nsplendid Temple, their fleets of merchant ships, their schools of\r\nsacred learning, their great statesmen and soldiers, their natural\r\nphilosophers, their historians, and their poets. What nation ever\r\ncontended more manfully against overwhelming odds for its independence\r\nand religion? What nation ever, in its last agonies, gave such signal\r\nproofs of what may be accomplished by a brave despair? And if, in the\r\ncourse of many centuries, the oppressed descendants of warriors and\r\nsages have degenerated from the qualities of their fathers ... shall\r\nwe consider this as a matter of reproach to them? Shall we not rather\r\nconsider it as matter of shame and remorse to ourselves? Let us do\r\njustice to them. Let us open to them the door of the House of Commons.\r\nLet us open to them every career in which ability and energy can be\r\ndisplayed. Till we have done this, let us not presume to say that\r\nthere is no genius among the countrymen of Isaiah, no heroism among\r\nthe descendants of the Maccabees.\r\n\r\n                                                  LORD MACAULAY, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         IGNORANCE OF JUDAISM\r\n\r\nHE had been roused to the consciousness of knowing hardly anything\r\nabout modern Judaism or the inner Jewish history. The Chosen People\r\nhave been commonly treated as a people chosen for the sake of somebody\r\nelse, and their thinking as something (no matter exactly what) that\r\nought to have been entirely otherwise; and Deronda, like his neighbours,\r\nhad regarded Judaism as a sort of eccentric fossilized form which an\r\naccomplished man might dispense with studying, and leave to specialists.\r\nBut there had flashed on him the hitherto neglected reality that\r\nJudaism was something still throbbing in human lives, still making for\r\nthem the only conceivable vesture of the world.\r\n\r\n                                                 GEORGE ELIOT, 1876,\r\n                                                _in ‘Daniel Deronda’_.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n              MOCK on, mock on, Voltaire, Rousseau!\r\n                  Mock on, mock on! ’tis all in vain:\r\n              You throw the sand against the wind,\r\n                  And the wind blows it back again.\r\n\r\n              And every sand becomes a gem\r\n                  Reflected in the beams divine;\r\n              Blown back, they blind the mocking eye,\r\n                  But still in Israel’s paths they shine.\r\n\r\n                                            WILLIAM BLAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THEY ARE OUR ELDERS\r\n\r\nNEXT to the selection that has been in operation for centuries, it is,\r\nin my opinion, the antiquity and the continuity of their civilization\r\nthat throws some light upon the Jews as well as upon the place they\r\noccupy in our midst. They were here before us; they are our elders.\r\nTheir children were taught to read from the scrolls of the Torah before\r\nour Latin alphabet had reached its final form, long before Cyrillus\r\nand Methodius had given writing to the Slavs, and before the Runic\r\ncharacters were known to the Germans of the North. As compared with the\r\nJews, we are young, we are new-comers; in the matter of civilization\r\nthey are far ahead of us. It was in vain that we locked them up for\r\nseveral hundred years behind the walls of the Ghetto. No sooner were\r\ntheir prison gates unbarred than they easily caught up with us, even\r\non those paths which we had opened up without their aid.\r\n\r\n                                              A.

These Hebrews in their graves,\r\n          Close by the street of this fair seaport town,\r\n      Silent beside the never-silent waves,\r\n          At rest in all this moving up and down.\r\n\r\n      How came they here? What burst of Christian hate,\r\n          What persecution, merciless and blind,\r\n      Drove o’er the sea――that desert desolate――\r\n          These Ishmaels and Hagars of mankind?\r\n\r\n      Pride and humiliation hand in hand\r\n          Walked with them through the world where’er they went;\r\n      Trampled and beaten were they as the sand,\r\n          And yet unshaken as the continent.\r\n\r\n      For in the background figures vague and vast\r\n          Of patriarchs and prophets rose sublime,\r\n      And all the great traditions of the Past\r\n          They saw reflected in the coming time.\r\n\r\n      And thus forever with reverted look\r\n          The mystic volume of the world they read,\r\n      Spelling it backward, like a Hebrew book,\r\n          Till life became a Legend of the Dead.\r\n\r\n                                         H. W. LONGFELLOW, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE JEW AS A CITIZEN\r\n\r\nI AM glad to be able to say that while the Jews of the United States\r\nhave remained loyal to their faith and their race traditions, they\r\nare engaged in generous rivalry with their fellow-citizens of other\r\ndenominations in advancing the interests of our common country. This\r\nis true, not only of the descendants of the early settlers and those\r\nof American birth, but of a great and constantly increasing proportion\r\nof those who have come to our shores within the last twenty-five\r\nyears as refugees reduced to the direst straits of penury and misery.\r\nIn a few years, men and women hitherto utterly unaccustomed to any\r\nof the privileges of citizenship have moved mightily upward toward\r\nthe standard of loyal, self-respecting American citizenship; of that\r\ncitizenship which not merely insists upon its rights, but also eagerly\r\nrecognizes its duty to do its full share in the material, social, and\r\nmoral advancement of the nation.\r\n\r\n                                            THEODORE ROOSEVELT,\r\n                                     _on the 250th anniversary of the\r\n                                       Settlement of the Jews in the\r\n                                      United States, November, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IN THE EAST END OF LONDON\r\n\r\nSOME years ago, when I was living in Europe, I went for six months to\r\nreside in the very poorest part of the East End of London, when I made\r\nfriends with a poor Jewish woman. She took me into the tiny one-roomed\r\ntenement where she and her husband and their children lived on the few\r\nshillings a week they earned by their joint labour. Though it had all\r\nthe misery and confinement which extreme poverty means in a great city,\r\nI had yet often a curious feeling that it was a _home_. With however\r\nmuch difficulty, a few pence would be saved to celebrate, if it were\r\nbut in a pitiful little way, the festivals of their people; though it\r\nwere by starving themselves, the parents would lay by something for\r\nthe education of their children or to procure them some little extra\r\ncomfort. And the conclusion was forced on me that, taking the very\r\npoorest class of Jew and comparing him with an exactly analogous class\r\nof non-Jews earning the same wages and living in the same locality, the\r\nlife of the Jew was, on the whole, more mentally healthful, more human,\r\nand had in it an element of hope that was often wanting in that of\r\nothers. I felt that these people needed but a little space, a little\r\nchance, to develop into some far higher form. The material was there.\r\n\r\nTherefore I would welcome the exiled Russian Jew to South Africa, not\r\nmerely with pity, but with a feeling of pride that any member of that\r\ngreat, much-suffering people, to whom the world owes so great a debt,\r\nshould find a refuge and a home among us.\r\n\r\n                                                OLIVE SCHREINER, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE RUSSIAN AGONY[59]\r\n                           I. THE BEGINNINGS\r\n\r\nIN 1563 Ivan the Terrible conquered Polotzk, and for the first time\r\nthe Russian Government was confronted by the fact of the existence of\r\nthe Jewish nationality. The Czar’s advisers were somewhat perplexed,\r\nand asked him what to do with these newly acquired subjects. Ivan the\r\nTerrible answered unhesitatingly: ‘Baptize them or drown them in the\r\nriver’. They were drowned.\r\n\r\n                                                    P. MILYUKOV, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   II. IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY[60]\r\n\r\nFEW facts in the nineteenth century have been so well calculated to\r\ndisenchant the believers in perpetual progress with their creed as the\r\nanti-Semite movement, which in a few years has swept like an angry wave\r\nover the greater part of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe recent movement for proscribing, under pretence of preventing\r\ncruelty to animals, the mode of killing animals for food which is\r\nenjoined in the Jewish ritual, is certainly at least as much due to\r\ndislike to the Jews as to consideration for cattle. It appears to have\r\narisen among the German anti-Semites, especially in Saxony....\r\n\r\nThe Russian persecution stands in some degree apart from the other\r\nforms of the anti-Semite movement, both on account of its unparalleled\r\nmagnitude and ferocity, and also because it is the direct act of a\r\nGovernment deliberately, systematically, remorselessly seeking to\r\nreduce to utter misery millions of its own subjects.\r\n\r\nAn evil chance had placed upon the throne an absolute ruler who\r\ncombined with much private virtue and very limited faculties all the\r\ngenuine fanaticism of the great persecutors of the past, and who found\r\na new Torquemada at his side. He reigned over an administration which\r\nis among the most despotic, and probably, without exception, the most\r\ncorrupt and the most cruel in Europe.\r\n\r\n                                                 W. E. H. LECKY, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     III. IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\r\n\r\nTO lock people like wild beasts in a cage, to surround them with\r\ndisgraceful laws, as in an immense circus, for the sole revolting\r\npurpose to let loose the murderous mob upon them whenever practicable\r\nfor St. Petersburg――terrible, terrible!\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism is a mad passion, akin to the lowest perversities of\r\ndiseased human nature. It is the will to hate.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Hadrian was an honest anti-Semite. One day, the Talmud\r\nrecords, on his journey in the East, a Jew passed the Imperial train\r\nand saluted the Emperor. He was beside himself with rage. ‘You, a Jew,\r\ndare to greet the Emperor! You shall pay for this with your life.’\r\nIn the course of the same day another Jew passed him, and, warned\r\nby example, he did not greet Hadrian. ‘You, a Jew, dare to pass the\r\nEmperor without a greeting!’ he angrily exclaimed. ‘You have forfeited\r\nyour life.’ To his astonished courtiers he replied: ‘I hate the Jews.\r\nWhatever they do, I find intolerable. I therefore make use of any\r\npretext to destroy them.’\r\n\r\nSo are all anti-Semites.\r\n\r\n                                                    LEO TOLSTOY, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             IV. THE MORAL\r\n\r\nTHE study of the history of Europe during the past centuries teaches\r\nus one uniform lesson: _That the nations which have received and in any\r\nway dealt fairly and mercifully with the Jew have prospered; and that\r\nthe nations that have tortured and oppressed him have written out their\r\nown curse_.\r\n\r\n                                                OLIVE SCHREINER, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE BLOOD LIBEL\r\n                         BRITISH PROTEST, 1912\r\n\r\nWE desire to associate ourselves with the protests signed in Russia,\r\nFrance, and Germany by leading Christian Theologians, Men of Letters,\r\nScientists, Politicians, and others against the attempt made in the\r\nCity of Kieff to revive the hideous charge of Ritual Murder――known as\r\nthe ‘Blood Accusation’――against Judaism and the Jewish People.\r\n\r\nThe question is one of humanity, civilization, and truth. The ‘blood\r\naccusation’ is a relic of the days of witchcraft and ‘black magic’,\r\na cruel and utterly baseless libel on Judaism, an insult to Western\r\nculture, and a dishonour to the Churches in whose name it has been\r\nfalsely formulated by ignorant fanatics. Religious minorities other\r\nthan the Jews, such as the early Christians, the Quakers, and Christian\r\nMissionaries in China, have been victimized by it. It has been\r\ndenounced by the best men of all ages and creeds. The Popes, the\r\nfounders of the Reformation, the Khalif of Islam, statesmen of every\r\ncountry, together with all the great seats of learning in Europe, have\r\npublicly repudiated it.\r\n\r\n_Signed by_:――\r\n\r\n  _The_ ARCHBISHOPS _of_ CANTERBURY, YORK, ARMAGH; _the_ CARDINAL\r\n      ARCHBISHOP _of_ WESTMINSTER, _and the_ HEADS _of all other_\r\n      CHRISTIAN DENOMINATIONS.\r\n\r\n  _The_ BISHOPS _of_ LONDON, OXFORD, WORCESTER, WINCHESTER, BIRMINGHAM,\r\n      GLOUCESTER, LIVERPOOL, MANCHESTER, _&c._; _the_ DEANS _of_\r\n      WESTMINSTER, CANTERBURY, NORWICH, RIPON, _&c._\r\n\r\n  _The_ DUKES _of_ NORFOLK _and_ NORTHUMBERLAND, _and the_ EARLS _of_\r\n      ROSEBERY, SELBORNE, _and_ CROMER; LORDS MILNER _and_ RAYLEIGH;\r\n      A.

Jerusalem was indeed once a great city, and the Temple\r\nmagnifical; but the Jews themselves were greater than either; hence,\r\nwhile the two former have been given over to spoliation, the latter\r\nhave been wonderfully, miraculously preserved. The annals of the world\r\ndo not contain anything so remarkable in human experience, so greatly\r\nsurpassing human power and human prescience. Exiled and dispersed,\r\nreviled and persecuted, oppressed and suffering, often denied the\r\ncommonest rights of humanity, and still more often made the victim\r\nof ruthless fanaticism and bigoted prejudice, the Jews are divinely\r\npreserved for a purpose worthy of a God!\r\n\r\n                                                 ST.

They say, when God had finished the world, He asked\r\none of the angels if aught were wanting on land or on sea, in air or\r\nin heaven. The angel answered that all was perfect; one thing only he\r\ndesired――speech, to praise God’s works, or recount them, which would be\r\ntheir praise. And the Father approved the angel’s words, and not long\r\nafterwards appeared the race, gifted with the muses and with song. This\r\nis the ancient story, and in consonance with its spirit I say: ‘It is\r\nGod’s peculiar work to benefit, and His creatures’ work to give Him\r\nthanks’.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILO JUDAEUS, 1st cent.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHERE are halls in the heavens above that open but to the voice of song.\r\n\r\n                                                                ZOHAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ON MORNING SERVICE\r\n\r\nLET man strengthen himself like a lion and arise in the early morn to\r\nrender service to his Creator; as David said, ‘I will awake the dawn’\r\n(Psalm 57. 9).\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY: _Strengthen himself._――The root-idea of such strengthening\r\nis to prepare himself to resist temptations and evil desires which\r\nduring this day may assail him: as it is said, ‘Who is strong? He that\r\nsubdues his passions.’ _Like a lion._――As a lion is the most fearless\r\nof animals, so shall he likewise, in the performance of his duties,\r\nfear nothing, but rely firmly on his God.\r\n\r\nGLOSS: ‘I have set the Lord always before me’ (Psalm 16. 8): This is\r\na leading principle in Religion, and in the upward strivings of the\r\nrighteous who walk ever in the presence of God. For a man’s mode of\r\nlife, his demeanour and his deeds, his speech and his movements, when\r\nalone in the house or in the intimate circle of his family and friends,\r\nare unlike those which he would exhibit when in the presence of a\r\ngreat king. And how much more considered will his demeanour be, if\r\nhe reflect that there stands over him the King of kings, the Holy One,\r\nblessed be He, whose glory fills the whole earth, watching his conduct\r\nand surveying his deeds; even as it is written: ‘Can any hide himself\r\nin secret places that I shall not see him?’ saith the Lord (Jeremiah\r\n23. 24). Such contemplation must perforce imbue him with a true sense\r\nof reverence and humility, prompted by a feeling of unworthiness,\r\nbefore the Holy Name; and he will be heedless of whoever may mock at\r\nhim because of his devotions.\r\n\r\n                                               SHULCHAN ARUCH, 1, § 1.\r\n                                               (_Trans.

Between the eternal past and the eternal\r\nfuture comes the world of time. This is purely Jewish dogmatics.\r\nAristotle held that the world was eternal; Judaism, that it was\r\ncreated. It is God alone who is eternal. Further, Judaism conceives of\r\nGod as Something apart from, outside of, His world. He transcends man\r\nand the universe. Yet God is also immanent; He dwells within the human\r\nsoul as well as within the world. God is not one with man, but akin to\r\nman; He is high above the world, yet nigh unto them that call upon Him.\r\nThe God who exists for ever is proclaimed King when men acknowledge\r\nHis Kingship and show Him the allegiance of worship and obedience.\r\nThe God who stands high above creation is the One into whose hand man\r\ncommits himself without fear. The Majestic King is also the Redeemer.\r\nThe transcendent God is a Refuge in man’s distress. He does not merely\r\nraise a banner, He is the Banner; He does not only hold out the cup of\r\nsalvation, He is the consummate Cup.\r\n\r\n                                                    I.

Slowly and by degrees Science is being brought to recognize\r\nin the universe the existence of One Power, which is of no beginning\r\nand no end; which has existed before all things were formed, and will\r\nremain in its integrity when all is gone; the Source and Origin of all,\r\nin Itself beyond any conception or image that man can form and set up\r\nbefore his eye or mind; whereas all things perceivable as matter and\r\nforce are subjected to his inquiry and designs. This sum total of the\r\nscientific discoveries of all lands and times is an approach of the\r\nworld’s thought to our Adon Olam, the sublime chant, by means of which\r\nthe Jew has wrought and will further work the most momentous changes in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n                                                 W.

The first prayer of innocent child-lips, the last confession\r\nof the dying, the Shema has been the watchword and the rallying-cry\r\nof a hundred generations in Israel. By it were they welded into one\r\nBrotherhood to do the will of their Father who is in heaven. The\r\nreading of the Shema has――in rabbinic phrase――clothed Israel with\r\ninvincible lion-strength, and endowed him with the double-edged sword\r\nof the spirit against the unutterable terrors of his long night of\r\nexile.\r\n\r\n                                                    J.

Heathenism degraded\r\nman by making him kneel before brutes and the works of his hand:\r\nJudaism declared man to be made in the image of God, the crown and\r\nculmination of God’s creation, the appointed ruler of the earth. In\r\nhim, as the end of Creation, the earthly and the divine are singularly\r\nblended.\r\n\r\nJudaism rejects the idea of an inherent impurity in the flesh or in\r\nmatter as opposed to the spirit. Nor does Judaism accept the doctrine\r\nof Original Sin. In the words of the daily morning prayer, ‘The soul\r\nthat Thou hast given me is pure, Thou hast created it, Thou hast\r\nfashioned it, and Thou hast breathed it into me, and Thou preservest\r\nit within me, and at the appointed time Thou wilt take it from me to\r\nreturn it within me in the future’.\r\n\r\n                                                 K.

That\r\nman is best able to advance on the road to moral perfection who starts\r\nwith the accumulated spiritual heritage of righteous ancestors.\r\n\r\n                                                        S. LEVY, 1905.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE old Jewish doctrine of the ‘merit of the fathers’ has a\r\ncounterpart――the idea that the righteousness of the living child\r\nfavourably affects the fate of the dead father. This might be called\r\nthe doctrine of the ‘merit of the children’. In this way the living\r\nand the dead hold converse. The real message of the dead is――their\r\nvirtue. The real response of the living is again――their virtue. Thus\r\nis a bridge built over the chasm of the tomb. Thus do the hearts of\r\nfathers and children beat in eternal unison.\r\n\r\n                                                    I. ABRAHAMS, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE KADDISH\r\n\r\nITS origin is mysterious; angels are said to have brought it down\r\nfrom heaven and taught it to men. About this prayer the tenderest\r\nthreads of filial feeling and human recollection are entwined; for\r\nit is the prayer of the orphans! When the father or the mother dies,\r\nthe surviving sons are to recite it twice daily, morning and evening,\r\nthroughout the year of mourning, and then also on each recurring\r\nanniversary of the death――on the _Yahrzeit_.\r\n\r\nIt possesses wonderful power. Truly, if there is any bond strong and\r\nindissoluble enough to chain heaven to earth, it is this prayer. It\r\nkeeps the living together, and forms the bridge to the mysterious realm\r\nof the dead. One might almost say that this prayer is the watchman\r\nand the guardian of the people by whom alone it is uttered; therein\r\nlies the warrant of its continuance. Can a people disappear and be\r\nannihilated so long as a child remembers its parents? It may sound\r\nstrange: in the midst of the wildest dissipation has this prayer\r\nrecalled to his better self many a dissolute character, so that he has\r\nbethought himself and for a time at least purified himself by honouring\r\nthe memory of his parents.\r\n\r\nBecause this prayer is a resurrection in the spirit of the perishable\r\nin man, because it does not acknowledge death, because it permits\r\nthe blossom which, withered, has fallen from the tree of mankind to\r\nflower and develop again in the human heart, therefore it possesses\r\nsanctifying power. To know that when thou diest, the earth falling on\r\nthy head will not cover thee entirely; to know that there remain behind,\r\nthose who, wherever they may be on this wide earth, whether they may\r\nbe poor or rich, will send this prayer after thee; to know that thou\r\nleavest them no house, no estate, no field by which they must remember\r\nthee, and that yet they will cherish thy memory as their dearest\r\ninheritance――what more satisfying knowledge canst thou ever hope for?\r\nAnd such is the knowledge bequeathed to us all by the Kaddish.\r\n\r\n                                                           L.

And the particular institution in which it is embodied most\r\ncharacteristically is that of the Sabbath. I do not know how it has\r\ncome about that a ‘Judaic Sabbath’ means a day of austere gloom. As\r\na matter of fact, it is the one bright spot in the Jewish life. All\r\nis joy and good-humour in the Jewish home on the Friday night, when\r\nSabbath ‘comes in’. I would attribute a good deal of the difference\r\nbetween the Jewish and the Christian Sabbath to the seemingly\r\nmechanical difference that the former begins and ends at an hour when\r\nits advent or exit can be solemnized by ceremonial. It is, indeed, to\r\nthe Sabbath primarily, and the other home ceremonials which embody the\r\nHebraic conception of the Holiness of the Home, that we can trace the\r\nremarkable persistence of the Jewish race through the ages.\r\n\r\n                                                  JOSEPH JACOBS, 1889.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE patriarchal feeling still lingers about his hearth.

Ah! With what a\r\ndelirious impatience did Pharaoh’s slaves await the midnight hour that\r\nwas to be at once the knell of Egypt’s tyranny and the joy-note that\r\nannounced their own freedom! God Himself had singled it out as the time\r\nfor fulfilling His ancient promise――singled it out, as the Rabbins tell\r\nus in hyperbolical language, from the days of creation itself. Too long\r\nhad unrighteousness flourished. Too long had God seemed to slumber in\r\nHis Heaven; but now He was to show that the cry of the oppressed had\r\nnever failed to reach Him, for accumulated wrongs were to be redressed\r\nby a complete and unparalleled deliverance. It was for so signal a\r\nvindication of the Divine justice that this night was reserved. It\r\nwas as though the Supreme had set His finger upon this night, in the\r\nalmanac of Heaven, and declared: This shall witness the long-deferred\r\ntriumph of Right over Might; this shall tell for all time that I am\r\nthe Lord, that I reign, and that righteousness and justice are the\r\nfoundation of My throne, the principles on which I govern My world.\r\nThis night shall show to all coming generations that it is only the\r\nfool who says in his heart ‘There is no God’; that the earthly despot\r\nwho pursues his career of cruelty, thinking that he has only his\r\nvictims’ tears to reckon with, is deluding himself to his own ruin.\r\n\r\nAnd is this truth not worth treasuring in these latter days? Often\r\ndoes God seem to hide Himself, to have deserted earth and shut Himself\r\nup in Heaven. It is the souls of the meek and the faithful from which\r\nhumanity’s tears are distilled, from which the painful chorus of\r\na world’s lament goes up, and seemingly up in vain. But the lesson\r\ntaught to Pharaoh and to Israel on that awful, that joyous night of\r\ndeliverance, is still a living lesson; not one jot of its force is\r\nabated. God neither slumbers nor sleeps. He watches ever. Not one sigh\r\npasses unrecorded in the Heavenly Volume.\r\n\r\n                                                  MORRIS JOSEPH, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PASSOVER AND FREEDOM\r\n\r\nPASSOVER is the Festival of Spring. Its human appeal, therefore,\r\nis as old as humanity, and as perennial as Spring. But it is as an\r\nhistorical festival,――Israel’s birthday――as the annual commemoration of\r\nan event which has changed the destinies of mankind, that it proclaims\r\nthe man-redeeming truth, God is the God of Freedom. Even as in Egypt\r\nHe espoused the cause of brick-making helots against the mighty royal\r\noppressor, He for ever judgeth the world in righteousness, and the\r\npeoples with equity. There is an overruling Providence that exalts\r\nrighteousness and freedom and humbles the Dominion of iniquity and\r\noppression.

For\r\nis there a Jewish community anywhere, however safely domiciled, which\r\nhas relinquished the Torah for even one generation and has survived\r\nthat separation? The Jewish masses, though dispersed to the four winds\r\nof the world and mostly destitute of mere shelter――_because tenacious\r\nof their creed_, endure, true to themselves and to their past.\r\n\r\nThe Torah, therefore, is a fountain of life. In it is protection\r\ngreater than in fortresses. Those who forsake the Torah, bringing it\r\ninto disrepute and weakening the hold it has on us, are working at the\r\ndestruction of the brotherhood that cradled and sheltered their fathers\r\nand forefathers through all the vicissitudes of the bygone ages, to\r\nwhom they owe their own life and presence on earth.\r\n\r\n                                                 W. M. HAFFKINE, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RELIGION AND MORALITY\r\n\r\n‘I AM the Lord thy God’――the pronouncement that forms the\r\nintroduction to the Decalogue――is rightly regarded as the indispensable\r\nbasis for all the Commandments, upon whose conscientious fulfilment the\r\nwell-being of humanity depends. The identification of moral laws with\r\nreligious precepts, which has been so fully accomplished for the first\r\ntime in the Law of Moses, gives to the Bible its exceptional importance\r\nas a regulator of the conduct of men and of nations. Those who are\r\nconvinced that by wronging their fellow-men, or transgressing any of\r\nthe established laws, they violate a command that comes from God, and\r\ndefy the will of their Maker as expressed in His law, are much less\r\nliable to wrongdoing than those who create their own ethical theories\r\nand set up their own standards of right and wrong, relying upon their\r\nconscience and sense of honour as infallible guides. To some it seems\r\na kind of humiliation if a super-human authority is pointed to as\r\nthe indispensable guide of human conduct. But man ought never to\r\nhave assumed such pride as to feel humiliated by the idea of his\r\nimperfection and his need of guidance and restraint. History does not\r\njustify this pride.\r\n\r\n                                                  SALIS DAICHES, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SYMBOLS AND CEREMONIES\r\n\r\nYOU have heard that in Egypt the waters of the Nile overflowing\r\nits banks, take the place of rain; and that these fructifying waters\r\nare led by various channels into the remote fields to irrigate them.\r\nNow, the Nile with its precious floods would be of no benefit to\r\nthe fields without these channels. Thus it is with the Torah and the\r\n_Mitzvoth_.[66] The Torah is the mighty stream of spirituality flowing\r\nsince ancient times through Israel. It would have caused no useful\r\nfruits to grow, and would have produced no spiritual progress, no moral\r\nadvancement, had the Mitzvah not been there to lead its divine floods\r\ninto the houses, the hearts, and the minds of the individual members\r\nof the people, by connecting practical life in all its variety and its\r\nactivities with the spiritual truths of religion.\r\n\r\nIt is the greatest mistake, based on an entire misunderstanding of\r\nhuman nature, to assume that men are capable of living in a world of\r\nideas only, and can dispense with symbols that should embody these\r\nideas and give them tangibility and visible form. Only the Mitzvah is\r\nthe ladder connecting heaven and earth. The Tefillin, containing among\r\nothers the commandment: ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all\r\nthine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might’, are laid on\r\nthe head, the seat of thought, and on the arm, the instrument of action,\r\nopposite to the heart, the seat of feeling; thus teaching that all our\r\nthoughts, feelings, and actions must conform to the will of God. This\r\nMitzvah, performed daily, has contributed more effectively to preserve\r\nand to further the morality of our people than have all the learned\r\nbooks on ethics written by our religious philosophers.\r\n\r\n                                                        M. JUNG, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CUSTOM IN RELIGION\r\n\r\nRELIGION, they say, is only custom. I might agree with this if the\r\n‘only’ were left out. Customs are the flowers of civilization. You can\r\ntell a man’s education, yea, even much of his character, by his habits.\r\nMorality, ethics, are words derived from roots denoting that which is\r\nacknowledged and adopted by the people as right and proper. Manners\r\nand usages are the silent compact, the unwritten law which preserve the\r\nproprieties of civilized society.\r\n\r\nReligion will not come to our aid the moment we call for her; she\r\nmust be loved and cherished at all times if she is to prove our true\r\nfriend in need. Much of the present indifference of our young people is\r\ndirectly traceable to the absence of all religious observances in their\r\nhomes. Piety is the fruit of religious customs.\r\n\r\n                                                    G. GOTTHEIL, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ‘IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TIMES’\r\n\r\nWAS Judaism ever ‘in accordance with the times’? Did Judaism ever\r\ncorrespond with the views of dominant contemporaries? Was it ever\r\nconvenient to be a Jew or a Jewess?\r\n\r\nWas the Judaism of our ancestors in accordance with the times, when\r\ncompelled by the Egyptians to bend their necks during centuries under\r\nthe yoke of slavery and to suffer their babes to be buried in the waves\r\nof the Nile? Was the Judaism of the Maccabees in accordance with their\r\ntimes, when they resisted to the utmost the introduction of Grecian\r\nmanners prevailing in their days? When the Temple at Jerusalem was\r\ndestroyed by the Romans and the sons of Judah were slaughtered, sold\r\nin slave markets, cast before wild beasts or scattered through every\r\ncountry then known; when Worldly Wisdom would have taught, ‘Now it is\r\ncertainly impossible for us to remain Jews’――did not the Hillels[67]\r\nand the son of Zakkai[68] teach yet more earnestly the holiness of\r\nour laws and our customs, and so order and regulate things that not a\r\nfibre might be lost from the ancestral sanctuary? Was that Judaism in\r\naccordance with the times, for which, during the centuries following\r\nthe Dispersion, our fathers suffered in all lands, through all the\r\nvarious periods, the most degrading oppression, the most biting\r\ncontempt, and a thousand-fold death and persecution?\r\n\r\nAnd yet _we_ would make it the aim and scope of Judaism to be always\r\n‘in accordance with the times’!\r\n\r\n                                          SAMSON RAPHAEL HIRSCH, 1854.\r\n                                            (_Trans.

From the foot of Sinai there is wafted to us the voice\r\ndeclaring with the most perfect childlike faith, ‘_All that the Lord\r\nhath spoken we will do and we will hear_’. It is not surprising that a\r\npeople who, in their infancy, could give utterance to an expression of\r\ntrust so childlike, yet so sublime, should produce a prophet who summed\r\nup the whole of Israel’s law in the words, ‘_The just shall live by his\r\nfaith_’.\r\n\r\n                                                  SIMEON SINGER, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               צִיּוֹן הֲלֹא תִשְׁאֲלִי\r\n\r\n                              ODE TO ZION\r\n\r\n                       (HYMN FOR THE FAST OF AB)\r\n\r\n      ART thou not, Zion, fain\r\n      To send forth greetings from thy sacred rock\r\n      Unto thy captive train,\r\n      Who greet thee as the remnants of thy flock?\r\n      Take Thou on every side,\r\n      East, west and south and north, their greetings multiplied.\r\n      Sadly he greets thee still,\r\n      The prisoner of hope who, day and night,\r\n      Sheds ceaseless tears, like dew on Hermon’s hill.\r\n      Would that they fell upon thy mountain’s height!\r\n\r\n      Harsh is my voice when I bewail thy woes,\r\n      But when in fancy’s dreams\r\n      I see thy freedom, forth its cadence flows,\r\n      Sweet as the harps that hung by Babel’s streams.\r\n      The glory of the Lord will ever be\r\n      Thy sole and perfect light;\r\n      No need hast thou then, to illumine thee\r\n      Of sun by day, or moon and stars by night.\r\n      I would that, where God’s spirit was of yore\r\n      Poured out unto thy holy ones, I might\r\n      There too my soul outpour.\r\n\r\n      Oh, who will lead me on\r\n      To seek the spots where, in far distant years,\r\n      The angels in their glory dawned upon\r\n      Thy messengers and seers!\r\n      Oh, who will give me wings\r\n      That I may fly away,\r\n      And there, at rest from all my wanderings,\r\n      The ruins of my heart among thy ruins lay?\r\n      I’ll bend my face unto thy soil, and hold\r\n      Thy stones as special gold.\r\n      And when in Hebron I have stood beside\r\n      My fathers’ tombs, then will I pass in turn\r\n      Thy plains and forest wide,\r\n      Until I stand on Gilead and discern\r\n      Mount Hor and Mount Abarim, ’neath whose crest\r\n      Thy luminaries twain, thy guides and beacons rest.\r\n\r\n      Thy air is life unto my soul, thy grains\r\n      Of dust are myrrh, thy streams with honey flow\r\n      Naked and barefoot to thy ruined fanes\r\n      How gladly would I go!\r\n      To where the ark was treasured, and in dim\r\n      Recesses dwelt the holy cherubim.\r\n\r\n      Perfect in beauty, Zion, how in thee\r\n      Do love and grace unite!\r\n      The souls of thy companions tenderly\r\n      Turn unto thee; thy joy was their delight,\r\n      And weeping they lament thy ruin now.\r\n      In distant exile, for thy sacred height\r\n      They long, and towards thy gates in prayer they bow.\r\n      Shinar and Pathros! come they near to thee?\r\n      Naught are they by thy light and right divine.\r\n      To what can be compared the majesty\r\n      Of thy anointed line?\r\n      To what the singers, seers, and Levites thine?\r\n      The rule of idols fails and is cast down;\r\n      Thy power eternal is, from age to age thy crown.\r\n\r\n      The Lord desires thee for His dwelling-place\r\n      Eternally, and bless’d\r\n      Is he whom God has chosen for the grace\r\n      Within thy courts to rest.\r\n      Happy is he that watches, drawing near,\r\n      Until he sees thy glorious lights arise,\r\n      And over whom thy dawn breaks full and clear,\r\n      Set in the Orient skies.\r\n      But happiest he, who, with exultant eyes,\r\n      The bliss of thy redeemed ones shall behold,\r\n      And see thy youth renewed as in the days of old.\r\n\r\n                                           YEHUDAH HALEVI, 1145.\r\n                                          (_Trans.

With its 4,000 years’ history it is\r\ncoeval with the Jew, and is as unique among cities as is Israel among\r\nthe nations. Like the Jew, this Holy City of Israel――the spiritual\r\ncapital of humanity that has for ages been the magnetic pole of the\r\nlove and reverence of mankind――is deathless; fire and sword and all\r\nthe engines of destruction have been hurled against it in vain. A score\r\nof conquerors have held it as their choicest prize; and more than a\r\ndozen times has it been utterly destroyed. The Assyrians burnt it and\r\ndeported its population; the Romans slew a million of its inhabitants,\r\nrazed it to the ground, passed the ploughshare over it, and strewed its\r\nfurrows with salt; Hadrian banished its very name from the lips of men,\r\nchanged it to ‘Aelia Capitolina’, and prohibited any Jew from entering\r\nits precincts on pain of death. Persians and Arabs, Barbarians and\r\nCrusaders and Turks, took it and retook it, ravaged it and burnt it;\r\nand yet, marvellous to relate, it ever rises from its ashes to renewed\r\nlife and glory. And now, on the very day that 2,080 years ago Judah\r\nMaccabee rescued it from the heathens, the Holy City has passed into\r\nBritish occupation! What a privilege it is to have lived to see such\r\na world-historic event! A new future, with undreamt-of possibilities,\r\nopens before this eternal city of the eternal people. But in the\r\nfuture, as in the past, it will proclaim the prophetic teaching of\r\nthe Maccabean festival: ‘_Not by might, nor by power, but by My spirit,\r\nsaith the Lord of Hosts_’.\r\n\r\n                                   J.

Let our endeavours\r\nto see ourselves as we really are, our sorrow for our shortcomings, the\r\nunrest of our unshriven soul, prepare us for the final act of atonement.\r\nThe Day of Atonement shall lead us, with hearts bowed in submission, to\r\nthe Divine throne; and God will lovingly lift us up, absolved, forgiven,\r\nfilled with the spirit of faith and loving obedience.

And who, I ask you, is going\r\nto argue with a _Litvack_?\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the Rebbe?\r\n\r\n‘I don’t know, and I don’t care’, says he, shrugging his shoulders, and\r\nall the while (what it is to be a Lithuanian!) determined to find out!\r\n\r\nThe very same evening, soon after prayers, the Lithuanian steals into\r\nthe Rebbe’s room, lays himself down under the Rebbe’s bed, and lies low.\r\nHe intends to stay there all night, to find out where the Rebbe goes,\r\nand what he does at Sliches-time.\r\n\r\nDay has not broken when he hears the call to prayer. The Rebbe has been\r\nawake some time. The Lithuanian has heard him sighing and groaning for\r\na whole hour. Whoever has heard the groaning of the Nemirover Rebbe\r\nknows what sorrow for All-Israel, what distress of mind, found voice in\r\nevery groan.\r\n\r\nAfter that the Lithuanian hears the people rise and leave the house.\r\nOnce more it is quiet and dark, only a very little moonlight comes in\r\nthrough the shutter. He confessed afterwards, did the Lithuanian, that\r\nwhen he found himself alone with the Rebbe, terror took hold of him.\r\nBut a Lithuanian is dogged. He quivers and quakes like a fish, but he\r\ndoes not budge.\r\n\r\nAt last the Rebbe (long life to him!) rises in his turn. He goes to\r\nthe wardrobe, and takes out a packet which proves to be the dress of\r\na peasant: linen trousers, high boots, a pelisse, a wide felt hat, and\r\na long and broad leather belt studded with brass nails. The Rebbe puts\r\nthem on.\r\n\r\nOut of the pockets of the pelisse dangles the end of a thick cord, a\r\npeasant’s cord.\r\n\r\nOn his way out, the Rebbe steps aside into the kitchen, stoops, takes a\r\nhatchet from under the bed, puts it into his belt, and leaves the house.\r\nThe Lithuanian trembles, but he persists.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nA fearful Solemn Day hush broods over the dark streets, broken not\r\ninfrequently by a cry of supplication from some little Minyan, or the\r\nmoan of some sick person behind a window. The Rebbe keeps to the street\r\nside, and walks in the shadow of the houses. He glides from one to the\r\nother, the Lithuanian after him. And the Lithuanian hears the sound of\r\nhis own heart-beats mingle with the heavy footfall of the Rebbe; but he\r\nfollows on, and together they emerge from the town.\r\n\r\nBehind the town stands a little wood. The Rebbe (long life to him!)\r\nenters it. He walks on thirty or forty paces, and then he stops beside\r\na small tree. And the Lithuanian, with amazement, sees the Rebbe take\r\nhis hatchet and strike the tree. He sees the Rebbe strike blow after\r\nblow, he hears the tree creak and snap. And the little tree falls, and\r\nthe Rebbe splits it up into logs, and the logs into splinters. Then he\r\nmakes a bundle, binds it round with the cord, throws it on his shoulder,\r\nreplaces the hatchet in his belt, leaves the wood, and goes back into\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nIn one of the back streets he stops beside a poor, tumble-down little\r\nhouse, and taps at the window.\r\n\r\n‘Who is there?’ cries a frightened voice within.\r\n\r\nThe Lithuanian knows it to be the voice of a Jewess, a sick Jewess.\r\n\r\n‘I’, answers the Rebbe, in the peasant tongue.\r\n\r\n‘Who is I?’ inquires the voice, further.\r\n\r\nAnd the Rebbe answers again in the Little-Russian speech:\r\n\r\n‘Vassil.’\r\n\r\n‘Which Vassil? And what do you want, Vassil?’\r\n\r\n‘I have wood to sell’, says the sham peasant, ‘very cheap, for next to\r\nnothing.’ And without further ado he goes in. The Lithuanian steals in\r\nbehind him, and sees, in the grey light of dawn, a poor room with poor,\r\nbroken furniture. In the bed lies a sick Jewess huddled up in rags, who\r\nsays bitterly:\r\n\r\n‘Wood to sell――and where am I, a poor widow, to get money to buy it?’\r\n\r\n‘I will give you a six-groschen worth on credit.’\r\n\r\n‘And how am I ever to repay you?’ groans the poor woman.\r\n\r\n‘Foolish creature!’ the Rebbe upbraids her. ‘See here: you are a poor\r\nsick Jewess, and I am willing to trust you with the little bundle of\r\nwood; I believe that in time you will repay me. And you, you have such\r\na great, mighty God, and you do not trust Him! Not even to the amount\r\nof a miserable six groschen for a bundle of wood!’\r\n\r\n‘And who is to light the stove?’ groans the widow. ‘Do I look like\r\ngetting up to do it, and my son away at work?’\r\n\r\n‘I will also light the stove for you’, said the Rebbe. And the Rebbe,\r\nwhile he laid the wood in the stove, repeated, groaning, the first part\r\nof the Sliches. Then, when the stove was alight and the wood crackled\r\ncheerily, he repeated, more gaily, the second part of the Sliches. He\r\nrepeated the third part when the fire had burnt itself out, and he shut\r\nthe stove doors.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe Lithuanian, who saw all this, remained with the Rebbe as one of his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nAnd, later, when any one told how the Rebbe early every morning at\r\nSliches-time raised himself and flew up into heaven, the Lithuanian,\r\ninstead of laughing, added quietly:\r\n\r\n‘If not higher.’\r\n\r\n                                                   J.

Sin is not an evil power whose chains the children of\r\nflesh must helplessly drag towards a weary tomb. We can always shake\r\noff its yoke; and what is more, we need never assume its yoke. An\r\nancient fable tells us of distant oceans with mountainous rocks of\r\nmagnet of such terrific power that wreck and ruin befell any ship\r\nventuring near them. Instantly the iron nails would fly out of the\r\nship, bolts and fastenings would be torn away by that magnetic force;\r\nthe vessel would become nothing more than so many planks of wood, and\r\nall on board fall a prey to the hungry waters. Sins there are that,\r\nlikewise, unhinge all our stays of character, rob us of the restraints\r\nof past habits and education, and leave us helpless playthings on the\r\nbillows of temptation and passion. Yet a man is the pilot of his life’s\r\nbarque, and can at all times steer it so as never to come near those\r\nmountains of destruction and death.\r\n\r\nAnd, secondly, there is an atonement for man’s sins. We may repair\r\nthe ravages of sin, rebuild the shifting foundations of character,\r\nand join again the sundered strands of our spiritual fabric. We spurn\r\nthe old pagan fatalism which declares that there is no forgiveness for\r\nsin. Nature provides some escape from physical disease; shall the soul,\r\ninjured by temptation’s fire, scarred by sin, not be able to recover\r\nits pristine strength and beauty? No matter how harsh nature and man\r\nmay seem, the God of Eternal Right holds a deep pity that can atone and\r\nsave, bury not only sin, but its grave and graveyard with it!\r\n\r\nAs clear as a bell resounds the third and greatest teaching of Yom\r\nKippur: man himself must prepare himself for atonement, and no priest\r\nor mediator can prepare or work atonement for him. Virtue is victory\r\nby the individual himself over temptation that assails him. The battle\r\ncannot be fought nor the victory won by another. The human soul,\r\nwandering on the devious labyrinthine paths of sin, must itself essay\r\nto forsake the Way of Sorrow and proceed on the Way of Salvation.\r\nThis is the most splendid, the most momentous fact in human life: that\r\nthough man cannot always even half control his destiny, God has given\r\nthe reins of man’s conduct altogether into his hands.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the Synagogue has ever looked upon this day of prayer,\r\nfasting, and humiliation as a _festival_. A generation or two ago\r\nour forefathers stood robed in white in the Synagogue, during the\r\nentire Atonement Day. Originally these white garments were not worn\r\nas reminders of the grave; they were an outward sign of the festal\r\ncharacter of this Day, appointed for life’s spiritual renewal. ‘When\r\nmen are summoned before an earthly ruler’, says the Jerusalem Talmud,\r\n‘to defend themselves against some charge, they appear downcast and\r\ndressed in black like mourners. Israel appears before God on the\r\nAtonement Day attired in white as if going to a feast, because he is\r\nconfident that as soon as he returns penitently to his Maker, He will\r\nnot condemn, but will abundantly pardon.’\r\n\r\n                                                    J.

In some communities of the Middle Ages there were\r\npersons who, by their conduct, had placed themselves outside the\r\npale of Judaism; cowardly apostates, for example, who sold their\r\nsouls; informers, who spread broadcast false accusations against their\r\nbrethren; insubordinates, outcasts, criminals. Throughout the year\r\nthese never sought spiritual fellowship with their brethren. On Yom\r\nKippur, however, they would steal into some corner of the synagogue\r\nand join the worshippers in prayer. The Rabbis thereupon instituted\r\nthis solemn declaration, in order to proclaim in most unmistakable\r\nterms that, no matter what is a man’s mode of life――slanderer, apostate,\r\noutcast――he is still a brother. ‘_We_ have transgressed, _we_ have\r\ndealt treacherously, _we_ have robbed,’ do we pray. We associate\r\nourselves with the most forlorn souls that sin in darkness, because we\r\nrecognize that society――we ourselves――are largely responsible for their\r\nactions. Many a time has our evil example misled others, and become a\r\nstumbling-block in the way of the blind. And all our Yom Kippur vows\r\nto rise to a higher life are useless, unless we endeavour to raise\r\nothers who have fallen. A traveller was crossing mountain heights of\r\nuntrodden snow alone. He struggled bravely against the sense of sleep\r\nwhich weighed down his eyelids, but it was fast stealing over him, and\r\nhe knew that if he fell asleep death would inevitably follow. At this\r\ncrisis his foot struck against a heap lying across his path. Stooping\r\ndown, he found it to be a human body half buried in the snow.

In general, let me impress this\r\nprinciple upon thy mind: the essence of our whole law is contained in\r\nthese three things――reverence, love, joy. They are the way to bring us\r\nnear to God. Thy contrition on the day of fasting is in no wise more\r\npleasing to Him than thy joy on the sabbath or the festival, if so be\r\nthat thy delight comes from a devout and full heart. Just as prayer\r\nrequires reflection and devotion, so does joy in God’s commandments and\r\nthe study of His revelation. Thou must rejoice in the love of Him who\r\ngave the Law, being persuaded that the giving thereof was an act of His\r\nlove towards thee.\r\n\r\n                                                 YEHUDAH HALEVI, 1141.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PALMS AND MYRTLES\r\n\r\n              THY praise, O Lord, will I proclaim\r\n              In hymns unto Thy glorious name.\r\n              O Thou Redeemer, Lord and King,\r\n              Redemption to Thy faithful bring!\r\n              Before Thine altar they rejoice\r\n              With branch of palm and myrtle-stem;\r\n              To Thee they raise the prayerful voice――\r\n              Have mercy, save and prosper them.\r\n\r\n              They overflow with prayer and praise\r\n              To Him who knows the future days.\r\n              Have mercy Thou, and hear the prayer\r\n              Of those who palms and myrtles bear.\r\n              Thee day and night they sanctify\r\n              And in perpetual song adore;\r\n              Like to the heavenly host, they cry,\r\n              ‘Blessed art Thou for evermore’.\r\n\r\n                                ELEAZAR KALIR, 8th cent.\r\n                                (_Trans.

He realizes the fact that\r\nIsrael was once a people who lived by tilling the soil, and that the\r\ncommercial character which so largely distinguishes his people in these\r\ntimes is not, as is commonly thought, inborn, but is the result of the\r\nunkindly conditions in which they have been compelled to live. It is\r\ngood for us and the world at large to remember that the history of our\r\nrace has its idyllic side.\r\n\r\n                                                  MORRIS JOSEPH, 1903.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE vineyards of Israel have ceased to exist, but the eternal Law\r\nenjoins the children of Israel still to celebrate the vintage.

It is so delightful to pity\r\nourselves, to yield to the ‘luxury of woe’, and sing a plaintive song\r\nof self-commiseration in a minor key. But the next step is to give your\r\nsoul to the devil. Judaism is not more emphatic against the latter than\r\nthe former, and I am sure that there are few wickeder thoughts than\r\nthis: that God made me with a despondent, melancholy heart. Shammai\r\nsaid: ‘Always be cheerful’. R. Ishmael said: ‘Ever be joyful’. This\r\nRabbi Ishmael died a martyr’s death in the second century of this\r\nera. Do you think that when he suffered he repined and said: ‘If I had\r\nknown how my life was to end I would have wept my days away instead of\r\njoyously doing my duty’? Serve the Lord with gladness, and the gladness\r\nwill leave its after-glow of resignation, contentment, and peace.\r\n\r\n                                                    I.

And he sent\r\nletters unto Jerusalem and the cities of Judah that they should profane\r\nthe sabbaths and feasts, pollute the sanctuary, and build altars and\r\ntemples and shrines for idols; and whosoever shall not do according\r\nto the word of the king, he shall die. And he appointed overseers over\r\nall the people, and he commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice, city\r\nby city. And they did evil things in the land; and they made Israel to\r\nhide themselves in every place of refuge which they had. And they rent\r\nin pieces the Books of the Law which they found, and set them on fire.\r\nAnd wheresoever was found with any a Book of the Covenant, and if any\r\nconsented to the Law, the king’s sentence delivered him to death.\r\n\r\nAnd in those days rose up Mattathias, a priest from Jerusalem; and\r\nhe dwelt at Modin. And he had five sons, John, Simon, Judas (who was\r\ncalled Maccabaeus), Eleazar, Jonathan. And he saw the blasphemies that\r\nwere committed in Judah and in Jerusalem, and Mattathias and his sons\r\nrent their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned exceedingly.\r\n\r\nAnd the king’s officers, that were enforcing the apostasy, came into\r\nthe city Modin. And many of Israel came unto them, and Mattathias\r\nand his sons were gathered together. And the king’s officers spake to\r\nMattathias, saying, ‘Thou art a ruler and an honourable and great man\r\nin this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren; now therefore\r\ncome thou first and do the commandment of the king, as all nations have\r\ndone, and the men of Judah, and they that remain in Jerusalem; so shalt\r\nthou and thy house be in the number of the king’s Friends, and thou and\r\nthy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.’\r\nAnd Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice, ‘_Though all the\r\nnations that are under the king’s dominion obey him, and fall away\r\nevery one from the religion of their fathers, yet will I and my sons\r\nand my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers_.’ And Mattathias\r\ncried out in the city with a loud voice, saying, ‘Whosoever is zealous\r\nfor the Law, and maintaineth the Covenant, let him follow me.’\r\n\r\nThen were gathered together unto them every one that offered himself\r\nwillingly for the Law. And all they that fled from the evils were\r\nadded to them, and became a stay unto them. And they mustered a host,\r\nand pulled down the altars; and they pursued after the sons of pride,\r\nneither suffered they the sinner to triumph.\r\n\r\n                                                  _Selection from_\r\n                                              1 MACCABEES 1. 41‒2. 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FEAST OF LIGHTS\r\n\r\n        KINDLE the taper like the steadfast star,\r\n          Ablaze on evening’s forehead o’er the earth,\r\n        And add each night a lustre till afar\r\n          An eightfold splendour shine above thy hearth.\r\n        Clash, Israel, the cymbals, touch the lyre,\r\n          Blow the brass trumpet and the harsh-tongued horn;\r\n        Chant psalms of victory till the heart takes fire,\r\n          The Maccabean spirit leap new-born.\r\n\r\n                                                EMMA LAZARUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MENORAH\r\n\r\nDEEP in his soul he began to feel the need of being a Jew.

But there was no change for the better;\r\nand every blow, even though not aimed directly at him, struck him with\r\nfresh pain, till little by little his soul became one bleeding wound.\r\nThese sorrows, buried deep in his heart and silenced there, evoked\r\nthoughts of their origin and of his Judaism; and now he did something\r\nhe could not perhaps have done in the old days――he began to love his\r\nJudaism with an intense fervour. Although in his own eyes he could not,\r\nat first, clearly justify this new yearning, it became so powerful at\r\nlength that it crystallized from vague emotions into a definite idea\r\nwhich he must needs express. It was the conviction that there was only\r\none solution for this moral misery――the return to Judaism.\r\n\r\nThe Jew of to-day had lost the poise which was his fathers’ very being.\r\nThis generation, having grown up under the influence of alien cultures,\r\nwas no longer capable of that return which he had perceived to be their\r\nredemption. But the new generation would be capable of it, if it were\r\nonly given the right direction early enough. He resolved, therefore,\r\nthat his own children, at least, should be shown the proper path. They\r\nshould be trained as Jews in their own home.\r\n\r\nHitherto he had permitted to pass by unobserved the holiday which the\r\nwonderful apparition of the Maccabees had illumined for thousands of\r\nyears with the glow of miniature lights. Now, however, he made this\r\nholiday an opportunity to prepare something beautiful which should\r\nbe for ever commemorated in the minds of his children. In their young\r\nsouls should be implanted early a steadfast devotion to their ancient\r\npeople. He bought a Menorah, and when he held this nine-branched\r\ncandlestick in his hands for the first time, a strange mood came over\r\nhim. In his father’s house also the lights had once burned in his youth,\r\nnow far away, and the recollection gave him a sad and tender feeling\r\nfor home. The tradition was neither cold nor dead――thus it had passed\r\nthrough the ages, one light kindling another. Moreover, the ancient\r\nform of the Menorah had excited his interest. Clearly the design was\r\nsuggested by the tree――in the centre the sturdy trunk, on right and\r\nleft four branches, one below the other, in one place, and all of equal\r\nheight. A later symbolism brought with it the short ninth branch, which\r\nprojects in front and functions as a servant. What mystery had the\r\ngenerations which followed one another read into this form of art, at\r\nonce so simple and natural! And our artist wondered to himself if it\r\nwere not possible to animate again the withered form of the Menorah――to\r\nwater its roots, as one would a tree. The mere sound of the name,\r\nwhich he now pronounced every evening to his children, gave him great\r\npleasure. There was a lovable ring to the word when it came from the\r\nlips of little children.\r\n\r\nOn the first night the candle was lit and the origin of the holiday\r\nexplained. The wonderful incident of the lights that strangely remained\r\nburning so long, the story of the return from the Babylonian exile,\r\nthe second Temple, the Maccabees――our friend told his children all he\r\nknew. It was not very much, to be sure; but it served. When the second\r\ncandle was lit, they repeated what he had told them; and though it had\r\nall been learnt from him, it seemed to him quite new and beautiful. In\r\nthe days that followed, he waited keenly for the evenings which became\r\never brighter. Candle after candle stood in the Menorah, and the\r\nfather mused on the little candles with his children till at length\r\nhis reflections became too deep to be uttered before them.\r\n\r\nThen came the eighth day, when the whole row burns, even the faithful\r\nninth, the servant, which on other nights is used only for the lighting\r\nof the others. A great splendour streamed from the Menorah. The\r\nchildren’s eyes glistened. But for our friend all this was the symbol\r\nof the enkindling of a nation. When there is but one light, all is\r\nstill dark, and the solitary light looks melancholy. Soon it finds one\r\ncompanion, then another, and another. The darkness must retreat. The\r\nlight comes first to the young and the poor――then others join who love\r\nJustice, Truth, Liberty, Progress, Humanity, and Beauty. When all the\r\ncandles burn, then we must all stand and rejoice over the achievement.\r\nAnd no office can be more blessed than that of a Servant of the Light.\r\n\r\n                                                  THEODOR HERZL.\r\n                                            (_Trans.

The Maccabees boldly faced overwhelming odds,\r\nnot for their own selfish ends, but in a spirit of self-sacrificing\r\nfidelity to the holiest of all causes. They threw themselves upon the\r\nenemy in the temper that takes the martyr to the stake; they did it not\r\nfor gain or glory, but solely for conscience’ sake. They felt that God\r\nwas calling to them, and they could not hold back. Theirs was a unique\r\neffort. Others had, it is true, displayed an equally noble courage on\r\nthe battle-field. But what they had fought for was their fatherland and\r\ntheir mother tongue, their hearths and homes. To fight for Religion was\r\na new thing.\r\n\r\nThe little Maccabean band was like a rock in the midst of a surging sea.\r\nStanding almost alone in their day, the heroes beat back the forces\r\nthat threatened to involve all mankind in a common demoralization. They\r\nkept a corner of the world sweet in an impure age. They held aloft the\r\ntorch of true religion at a time when thick darkness was covering the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n                                                  MORRIS JOSEPH, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHANUCAH HYMN\r\n\r\n                  ROCK of Ages, let our song\r\n                  Praise Thy saving power;\r\n                  Thou, amidst the raging foes,\r\n                  Wast our shelt’ring tower.\r\n                  Furious they assailed us,\r\n                  But Thine arm availed us;\r\n                      And Thy word\r\n                      Broke their sword\r\n                  When our own strength failed us.\r\n\r\n                  Kindling new the holy lamps,\r\n                  Priests approved in suffering\r\n                  Purified the nation’s shrine,\r\n                  Brought to God their offering.\r\n                  And His courts surrounding\r\n                  Hear, in joy abounding,\r\n                      Happy throngs\r\n                      Singing songs\r\n                  With a mighty sounding.\r\n\r\n                  Children of the Martyr-race,\r\n                  Whether free or fettered,\r\n                  Wake the echoes of the songs\r\n                  Where ye may be scattered.\r\n                  Yours the message cheering,\r\n                  That the time is nearing\r\n                      Which shall see\r\n                      All men free,\r\n                  Tyrants disappearing.\r\n\r\n                                      G.

And\r\nhe brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter ... and\r\nwhen her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own\r\ndaughter.... And Esther was taken unto King Ahasuerus into his house\r\nroyal ... and the king loved Esther ... and she obtained grace and\r\nfavour in his sight....\r\n\r\nAfter these things did King Ahasuerus promote Haman, and set his seat\r\nabove all the princes that were with him. And Haman said, ‘There is a\r\ncertain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all\r\nthe provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of\r\nevery people, neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not\r\nfor the king’s profit to suffer them. If it please the king let it be\r\nwritten that they be destroyed ... both young and old, little children\r\nand women, in one day.’ And the king said unto Haman, ‘The people is\r\ngiven to thee to do with them as it seemeth good to thee’.\r\n\r\nNow, when Mordecai knew all that was done he rent his clothes ... and\r\ncharged Esther that she should go in unto the king to make supplication\r\nunto him for her people――‘Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape\r\nin the king’s house, more than all the Jews. For if thou altogether\r\nholdest thy peace at this time, then shall relief and deliverance arise\r\nto the Jews from another place: and who knoweth whether thou art not\r\ncome to the kingdom for such a time as this?’ ... Esther bade them\r\nreturn answer unto Mordecai, ‘So will I go in unto the king ... and if\r\nI perish, I perish....’\r\n\r\nThen Esther the queen ... said, ‘If I have found favour in thy sight,\r\nO king ... let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my\r\nrequest; for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain\r\nand to perish....’ Then spake the king Ahasuerus, ‘Who is he, and where\r\nis he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?’ And Esther said, ‘An\r\nadversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman’.\r\n\r\nThen said one of the chamberlains, ‘Behold also, the gallows which\r\nHaman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king (and saved\r\nthe king’s life) standeth in the house of Haman’. And the king said,\r\n‘Hang him thereon’. So they hanged Haman.... And the king said, ‘Write\r\nye also to the Jews as it liketh you, in the king’s name....’ The Jews\r\nhad light and gladness and joy and honour. And whithersoever the king’s\r\ncommandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy....\r\n\r\n... Therefore do the Jews ... make the fourteenth day of the month Adar\r\na day of gladness and feasting ... and of sending gifts to the poor.\r\n\r\n                                                       BOOK OF ESTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SERVANT OF GOD\r\n\r\n          SPIRIT and flesh are Thine,\r\n          O Heavenly Shepherd mine;\r\n          My hopes, my thoughts, my fears, Thou seest all,\r\n              Thou measurest my path, my steps dost know.\r\n          When Thou upholdest, who can make me fall?\r\n              When Thou restrainest, who can bid me go?\r\n          _O would that I might be\r\n          A servant unto Thee,\r\n              Thou God, by all adored!\r\n          Then, though by friends out-cast,\r\n          Thy hand would hold me fast,\r\n              And draw me near to Thee, my King and Lord!_\r\n\r\n          Fain would my heart come nigh\r\n          To Thee, O God, on high,\r\n          But evil thoughts have led me far astray\r\n              From the pure path of righteous government.\r\n          Guide Thou me back into Thy holy way,\r\n              And count me not as one impenitent.\r\n          _O would that I might be\r\n          A servant unto Thee,\r\n              Thou God, by all adored!\r\n          Then, though by friends out-cast,\r\n          Thy hand would hold me fast,\r\n              And draw me near to Thee, my King and Lord!_\r\n\r\n          Contrite and full of dread,\r\n          I mourn each moment fled,\r\n          ’Midst idle follies roaming desolate:\r\n              I sink beneath transgressions manifold,\r\n          That from Thy presence keep me separate,\r\n              Nor can sin-darkened eyes Thy light behold.\r\n          _O would that I might be\r\n          A servant unto Thee,\r\n              Thou God, by all adored!\r\n          Then, though by friends out-cast,\r\n          Thy hand would hold me fast,\r\n              And draw me near to Thee, my King and Lord!_\r\n\r\n          So lead me that I may\r\n          Thy sovereign will obey.\r\n          Make pure my heart to seek Thy truth divine;\r\n              When burns my wound, be Thou with healing near!\r\n          Answer me, Lord! for sore distress is mine,\r\n              And say unto Thy servant, I am here.\r\n          _O would that I might be\r\n          A servant unto Thee,\r\n              Thou God, by all adored!\r\n          Then, though by friends out-cast,\r\n          Thy hand would hold me fast,\r\n              And draw me near to Thee, my King and Lord!_\r\n\r\n                                       YEHUDAH HALEVI, 1140.\r\n                                      (_Trans.

They say that the good is found only exceptionally, whilst\r\nevil things are numerous and lasting. The origin of this error is to\r\nbe found in the circumstance that men judge of the _whole universe_ by\r\nexamining one single person only. If anything happens to him contrary\r\nto his expectation, forthwith they conclude that the whole universe is\r\nevil. All mankind at present in existence forms only an infinitesimal\r\nportion of the permanent universe. It is of great advantage that man\r\nshould know his station. Numerous evils to which persons are exposed\r\nare due to the defects existing in the persons themselves. We seek\r\nrelief from our own faults; we suffer from evils which we inflict on\r\nourselves, and we ascribe them to God who is far from connected with\r\nthem. As Solomon explained it: The foolishness of man perverteth his\r\nway, and his heart fretteth against the Lord.\r\n\r\n                                               MOSES MAIMONIDES, 1190.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE TWO NATURES IN MAN\r\n\r\nIT is because man is half angel, half brute, that his inner life\r\nwitnesses such bitter war between such unlike natures. The brute in him\r\nclamours for sensual joy and things in which there is only vanity; but\r\nthe angel resists and strives to make him know that meat, drink, sleep\r\nare but means whereby the body may be made efficient for the study of\r\nthe truths, and the doing of the will, of God. Not until the very hour\r\nof death can it be certain or known to what measure the victory has\r\nbeen won. He who is but a novice in the fear of God will do well to say\r\naudibly each day, as he rises: ‘This day I will be a faithful servant\r\nof the Almighty. I will be on my guard against wrath, falsehood, hatred,\r\nand quarrelsomeness, and will forgive those who wound me.’ For whoso\r\nforgives is forgiven in his turn; hard-heartedness and a temper that\r\nwill not make up quarrels are a heavy burden of sin, and unworthy of\r\nan Israelite.\r\n\r\n                                            MOSES OF COUCY, 13th cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FREEDOM OF THE WILL\r\n\r\nFREE will is granted to every man. If he desire to incline towards\r\nthe good way and be righteous, he has the power to do so; and if he\r\ndesire to incline towards the unrighteous way and be a wicked man, he\r\nhas also the power to do so. Give no room in your minds to that which\r\nis asserted by heathen fools, and also by many of the ignorant among\r\nthe Israelites themselves, namely: that the Holy One, blessed be He,\r\ndecrees that a man from his birth should be either a righteous man or\r\na wicked man.\r\n\r\nSince the power of doing good or evil is in our own hands, and\r\nsince all the wicked deeds which we have committed have been committed\r\nwith our full consciousness, it befits us to turn in penitence and to\r\nforsake our evil deeds; the power of doing so being still in our hands.\r\nNow this matter is a very important principle; nay, it is the pillar of\r\nthe Law and of the commandments.\r\n\r\n                                               MOSES MAIMONIDES, 1180.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE WICKED SAITH IN HIS HEART\r\n\r\n      FOR they said within themselves, reasoning not aright,\r\n      ‘Short and sorrowful is our life;\r\n      And there is no healing when a man cometh to his end,\r\n      And none was ever known that returned out of Hades.\r\n      Because by mere chance were we born,\r\n      And hereafter we shall be as though we had never been:\r\n      And our name shall be forgotten in time,\r\n      And no man shall remember our works;\r\n      And our life shall pass away as the traces of a cloud,\r\n      And shall be scattered as is a mist.\r\n      For our allotted time is the passing of a shadow,\r\n      And there is no putting back of our end.\r\n      Come therefore and let us enjoy the good things that now\r\n          are;\r\n      And let us use the creation with all our soul as youth’s\r\n          possession.\r\n      Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and perfumes;\r\n      And let no flower of spring pass us by:\r\n      Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be\r\n          withered:\r\n      Let none of us go without his share in our proud revelry:\r\n      Everywhere let us leave tokens of our mirth:\r\n      Because this is our portion, and our lot is this.\r\n      Let our strength be to us a law of righteousness;\r\n      For that which is weak is convicted to be of no service.’\r\n\r\n      Thus reasoned they, and they were led astray;\r\n      For their wickedness blinded them,\r\n      And they knew not the mysteries of God,\r\n      Neither hoped they for wages of holiness,\r\n      Nor did they judge that there is a prize for blameless\r\n          souls.\r\n      Because God created man for incorruption,\r\n      And made him an image of His own everlastingness.\r\n\r\n                      WISDOM OF SOLOMON 2. 1, 2, 4‒9, 11, 21‒3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       REPENTANCE OF THE WICKED\r\n\r\n      THEY shall say within themselves repenting:\r\n      ‘Verily we went astray from the way of truth,\r\n      We took our fill of the paths of lawlessness and\r\n          destruction,\r\n      And we journeyed through trackless deserts,\r\n      But the way of the Lord we knew not.\r\n      What did our arrogancy profit us?\r\n      And what good have riches and vaunting brought us?\r\n      Those things all passed away as a shadow,\r\n      As a ship passing through the billowy water,\r\n      Whereof, when it is gone by, there is no trace to be found,\r\n      Neither pathway of its keel in the billows:\r\n      Or as when a bird flieth through the air,\r\n      No token of her passage is found,\r\n      But the light wind, lashed with the stroke of her pinions,\r\n      And rent asunder with the violent rush, is passed through\r\n          by the motion of her wings,\r\n      And afterwards no sign of her coming is found therein:\r\n      So we also, as soon as we were born, ceased to be;\r\n      And of virtue we had no sign to show,\r\n      But in our wickedness we were utterly consumed.\r\n      Because the hope of the ungodly man is as chaff carried by\r\n          the wind,\r\n      And passeth by as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth\r\n          but a day.\r\n\r\n      ‘But the righteous live for ever,\r\n      And in the Lord is their reward,\r\n      And the care for them with the Most High.’\r\n\r\n                              WISDOM OF SOLOMON 5. 3, 6‒11, 13‒15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WISE COUNSEL\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nTHE soul, when accustomed to superfluous things, acquires a strong\r\nhabit of desiring others which are necessary neither for the\r\npreservation of the individual nor for that of the species. This\r\ndesire is without limit; whilst things which are necessary are few,\r\nand restricted within certain bounds. Lay this well to heart, reflect\r\non it again and again; that which is superfluous is without end (and\r\ntherefore the desire for it also without limit). Thus you desire to\r\nhave your vessels of silver, but golden vessels are still better;\r\nothers even have vessels studded with sapphires, emeralds, or rubies.\r\nThose, therefore, who are ignorant of this truth, that the desire for\r\nsuperfluous things is without limit, are constantly in trouble and pain.\r\nWhen they thus meet with the consequences of their course they complain\r\nof the judgements of God; they go so far as to say that God’s power\r\nis insufficient, because He has given to this Universe the properties\r\nwhich they imagine cause these evils.\r\n\r\n                                                     MOSES MAIMONIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nPREFER one in hand to two in hope; a little certainty is better than\r\na great perhaps. Sooner a servant among the noble than leader among\r\nthe common; for some of their honour will stick to you, while you must\r\nshare the contempt of your contemptible followers.\r\n\r\nThe proud cedar is felled, the lowly bush is untouched; fire rises and\r\ndies away, water flows down and for ever. If for what beauty or riches\r\nyou have, you raise your head above neighbour or brother, you feed\r\nhateful envy, and the beggar whom you despise may yet triumph over you.\r\nBetter enough in freedom than plenty at the table of another.\r\n\r\nLove thy children with impartial love; the hope oft errs that you place\r\non the more promising, and all your joy may come from him that you have\r\nkept in the background.\r\n\r\n                                             BENEDICT OF OXFORD, 1195.\r\n                                             (_Trans. Joseph Jacobs._)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nTHERE are seven marks of an uncultured, and seven of a wise, man. The\r\nwise man does not speak before him who is greater than he in wisdom,\r\nand does not break in upon the speech of his fellow; he is not hasty\r\nto answer; he questions according to the subject-matter, and answers\r\nto the point; he speaks upon the first thing first, and upon the last,\r\nlast; regarding that which he has not understood, he says, ‘I do not\r\nunderstand it’, and he acknowledges the truth.\r\n\r\n                                                ETHICS OF THE FATHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE DUTY OF HOLINESS\r\n\r\nI AM the Lord your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye\r\nholy; for I am holy.\r\n\r\n                                                     LEVITICUS 11. 44.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN rabbinical ethics, holiness is the highest ideal. The entire system\r\nof the Jewish law has the hallowing of life as its aim, to be reached\r\nthrough good works, through observance of the Sabbath and Holy-days,\r\nand through the sanctification of God’s name (Kiddush Hashem). Holiness\r\nbecame for rabbinical Judaism synonymous with purity of life, purity of\r\naction, and purity of thought; and under its influence personal purity\r\nin Judaism became the highest standard and maxim of ethics found in any\r\nreligious system.\r\n\r\n                                                  K. KOHLER,[79] 1904.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n‘CLEANLINESS is next to Godliness.’――Carefulness leads to cleanliness;\r\ncleanliness to purity; purity to humility; humility to saintliness;\r\nsaintliness to fear of sin; fear of sin to holiness; and holiness to\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\n                                                               TALMUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE CITY OF GOD\r\n\r\nDO not seek for the City of God on earth, for it is not built of wood\r\nor stone; but seek it in the soul of the man who is at peace with\r\nhimself and is a lover of true wisdom.\r\n\r\nIf a man practises ablutions of the body, but defiles his mind――if he\r\noffers hecatombs, founds a temple, adorns a shrine, and does nothing\r\nfor making his soul beautiful――let him not be called religious. He\r\nhas wandered far from real religion, mistaking ritual for holiness;\r\nattempting, as it were, to bribe the Incorruptible and to flatter Him\r\nwhom none can flatter. God welcomes the genuine service of a soul, the\r\nsacrifice of truth; but from display of wealth He turns away.\r\n\r\nWill any man with impure soul and with no intention to repent dare to\r\napproach the Most High God? The grateful soul of the wise man is the\r\ntrue altar of God.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILO JUDAEUS, 1st cent.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHINK not meanly of thyself, and despair not of perfection.\r\n\r\n                                               MOSES MAIMONIDES, 1200.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA MAN should so live that at the close of every day he can repeat: ‘I\r\nhave not wasted my day’.\r\n\r\n                                                                ZOHAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HUMILITY\r\n\r\nTHE man who does good works is more likely to be overtaken by pride\r\nin them than by any other moral mischance, and its effect on conduct\r\nis injurious in the extreme. Therefore, among the most necessary of\r\nvirtues is that one which banishes pride; and this is, humility.\r\n\r\nFirst among the signs by which the meek are known is that when\r\nmisfortunes come to them their endurance triumphs over their fear and\r\ngrief, and they willingly submit to the decree of God, and own that His\r\njudgements are righteous.\r\n\r\nIn matters of justice, however, the meek will be high-spirited and\r\nfearless, punishing the wicked without fear for favour. He will help\r\nthe oppressed and rescue him from the power of the oppressor.\r\n\r\n                                             BACHYA IBN PAKUDAH, 1040.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAT all times let a man fear God as well in private as in public,\r\nacknowledge the truth, and speak the truth in his heart; and let\r\nhim rise early and say: Sovereign of all worlds! Not because of our\r\nrighteous acts do we lay our supplications before Thee, but because\r\nof Thine abundant mercies.\r\n\r\n                                                    DAILY PRAYER BOOK.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWISDOM begetteth humility.\r\n\r\n                                               ABRAHAM IBN EZRA, 1167.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SAYINGS FROM THE TALMUD\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nBE thou the cursed, not he who curses. Be of them that are persecuted,\r\nnot of them that persecute. Look at Scripture: there is not a single\r\nbird more persecuted than the dove; yet God has chosen her to be\r\noffered up on His altar. The bull is hunted by the lion, the sheep by\r\nthe wolf, the goat by the tiger. And God said, ‘Bring Me a sacrifice,\r\nnot from them that persecute, but from them that are persecuted’.\r\n\r\nScripture ordains that the Hebrew slave who ‘loves’ his bondage shall\r\nhave his ear pierced against the door-post (Exodus 21). Why? Because it\r\nis that ear which heard on Sinai, ‘They are My servants, they shall not\r\nbe sold as bondsmen’. They are _My_ servants, not servants’ servants.\r\nAnd this man voluntarily throws away his precious freedom――‘Pierce his\r\near!’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nEVEN when the gates of heaven are shut to prayer, they are open to\r\ntears. Prayer is Israel’s only weapon, a weapon inherited from his\r\nfathers, a weapon tried in a thousand battles.\r\n\r\nWhen the righteous man dies, it is the earth that loses. The lost jewel\r\nwill always be a jewel, but the possessor who has lost it――well may he\r\nweep.\r\n\r\nTo one who denied resurrection, Gabiha ben Pasissa said: ‘If what\r\nnever before existed, exists, why may not that which once existed exist\r\nagain?’\r\n\r\nLife is a passing shadow, says Scripture. Is it the shadow of a tower,\r\nof a tree? A shadow that prevails for a while? No, it is the shadow of\r\na bird in its flight――away flies the bird, and there is neither bird\r\nnor shadow.\r\n\r\nRepent one day before thy death. There was a king who bade all his\r\nservants to a great repast, but did not indicate the hour. Some went\r\nhome and put on their best garments and stood at the door of the\r\npalace; others said, ‘There is ample time, the king will let us know\r\nbeforehand’. But the king summoned them of a sudden; and those that\r\ncame in their best garments were well received, but the foolish ones\r\nwho came in their slovenliness, were turned away in disgrace.\r\n\r\nIron breaks the stone, fire melts iron, water extinguishes fire,\r\nthe clouds drink up the water, a storm drives away the clouds, man\r\nwithstands the storm, fear unmans man, wine dispels fear, sleep drives\r\naway wine, and death sweeps all away――even sleep. But Solomon the Wise\r\nsays: ‘Charity delivereth from death’.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nFOUR shall not enter Paradise: the scoffer, the liar, the hypocrite,\r\nand the slanderer.\r\n\r\nThe cock and the owl both await the daylight. ‘The light’, says the\r\ncock, ‘brings delight to me; but what are you waiting for?’\r\n\r\nThy friend has a friend, and thy friend’s friend has a friend: be\r\ndiscreet.\r\n\r\nHe who is ashamed will not easily commit sin. Commit a sin twice, and\r\nyou will think it perfectly allowable. There is a great difference\r\nbetween him who is ashamed before his own self, and him who is only\r\nashamed before others.\r\n\r\nThe sun will go down all by himself, without thy assistance. Not what\r\nthou sayest about thyself, but what others say. He who humiliates\r\nhimself will be lifted up; he who raises himself up will be humiliated.\r\nWhosoever runs after greatness, greatness runs away from him; he who\r\nruns from greatness, greatness follows him.\r\n\r\nIf the young tell thee, Build; and the old tell thee, Destroy――follow\r\nthe counsel of the elders; for often the destruction of the elders is\r\nconstruction, and the construction of the young is destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n‘FEAR God, as much as you fear man’, said Johanan ben Zakkai.[80] ‘Not\r\nmore?’ asked his pupils in surprise. ‘If you would but fear Him as\r\nmuch!’ said the dying sage.\r\n\r\nThe righteous are masters of their passions. Not so the wicked: they\r\nare the slaves of their desires. The righteous need no monuments: their\r\ndeeds are their monuments. The righteous promise little and do much;\r\nthe wicked promise much and do not perform even a little. Let thy yea\r\nbe yea, and thy nay be nay.\r\n\r\nIn Palestine it was considered a sign of descent from a good family if\r\nany one first broke off in a quarrel. The greatest of heroes is he who\r\nturneth an enemy into a friend.\r\n\r\nGiving is not the essential thing, but to give with delicacy of\r\nfeeling. Scripture does not say, ‘Happy is he who giveth to the poor’,\r\nbut, ‘Happy is he who _wisely considereth_ the poor’. He who makes the\r\nsorrowful rejoice will partake of life everlasting.\r\n\r\nAs the ocean never freezes, so the gate of repentance is never closed.\r\nThe best preacher is the heart, the best teacher time, the best book\r\nthe world, the best friend God.\r\n\r\nHe who curbs his wrath, his sins will be forgiven. Whosoever does\r\nnot persecute them that persecute him, whosoever takes an offence in\r\nsilence, he who does good because of love, he who is cheerful under his\r\nsufferings, they are the friends of God, and of them the Scripture says,\r\n‘But they that love Him shall be as the sun, when he goeth forth in his\r\nmight’.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE DEDICATED LIFE\r\n\r\nMOSES has shown that we should all confess our gratitude for the powers\r\nwe possess. The wise man should dedicate his sagacity, the eloquent man\r\nshould devote his excellence of speech, to the praise of God in prose\r\nand verse; and, in general, the natural philosopher should offer his\r\nphysics, the moralist his ethics, the artist and the man of science\r\nthe arts and sciences they know. So, too, the sailor and the pilot will\r\ndedicate their favourable voyage, the husbandman his fruitful harvest,\r\nthe herdsman the increase of his cattle, the doctor the recovery of\r\nhis patients, the general his victory in fight, and the statesman or\r\nthe monarch his legal chieftaincy or kingly rule. Let no one, however\r\nhumble and insignificant he be, despairing of a better fortune, scruple\r\nto become a suppliant of God. Even if he can expect nothing more,\r\nlet him give thanks to the best of his power for what he has already\r\nreceived. Infinite are the gifts he has: birth, life, nature, soul,\r\nsensation, imagination, desire, reason. Reason is a small word, but\r\na most perfect thing, a fragment of the world-soul, or, as for the\r\ndisciples of the Mosaic philosophy it is more pious to say, a true\r\nimpression of the Divine Image.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILO JUDAEUS, 1st cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GOD AND MAN\r\n\r\nRABBI AKIBA[81] said: Beloved is man, for he was created in the image\r\nof God; but it was by a special love that it was made known to him that\r\nhe was created in the image of God.\r\n\r\nEverything is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is given; and the world\r\nis judged by grace, yet all is according to the amount of the work.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nBEN AZZAI[82] said: Despise not any man, and carp not at anything; for\r\nthere is not a man that has not his hour, and there is not a thing that\r\nhas not its place.\r\n\r\n                               * * * * *\r\n\r\nHILLEL[83] said: If I am not for myself, who will be for me?

Causeless hatred\r\nranks with the three capital sins: Idolatry, Immorality, and Murder.\r\nThe Second Temple, although in its time study of the Law and good works\r\nflourished and God’s Commandments were obeyed, was destroyed because of\r\ncauseless hatred, one of the deadly sins.\r\n\r\n                                               ACHAÏ (GAON), 8th cent.\r\n                                               (_Trans.

Reflect upon three things, and thou wilt not come within\r\nthe power of sin: Know what is above thee――a seeing Eye, a hearing Ear,\r\nand all thy deeds are written in a Book.\r\n\r\n                                                ETHICS OF THE FATHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      A MEDIAEVAL JEWISH MORALIST\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nNO crown carries such royalty with it as doth humility; no monument\r\ngives such glory as an unsullied name; no worldly gain can equal that\r\nwhich comes from observing God’s laws. The highest sacrifice is a\r\nbroken and contrite heart; the highest wisdom is that which is found in\r\nthe Law; the noblest of all ornaments is modesty; the most beautiful of\r\nall things man can do is to forgive wrong.\r\n\r\nCherish a good heart when thou findest it in any one; hate, for thou\r\nmayest hate it, the haughtiness of the overbearing man, and keep the\r\nboaster at a distance. There is no skill or cleverness to be compared\r\nto that which avoids temptation; there is no force, no strength that\r\ncan equal piety. All honour to him who thinks continually and with an\r\nanxious heart of his Maker; who prays, reads, and learns, and all these\r\nwith a passionate yearning for his Maker’s grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nLET thy dealings be of such sort that a blush need never visit thy\r\ncheek; be sternly dumb to the voice of passion; commit no sin, saying\r\nto thyself that thou wilt repent and make atonement at a later time.\r\nLet no oath ever pass thy lips; play not the haughty aristocrat in\r\nthine heart; follow not the desire of the eyes; banish carefully all\r\nguile from thy soul, all unseemly self-assertion from thy bearing and\r\nthy temper.\r\n\r\nSpeak never mere empty words; enter into strife with no man; place no\r\nreliance on men of mocking lips; wrangle not with evil men; cherish no\r\ntoo fixed good opinion of thyself, but lend thine ear to remonstrance\r\nand reproof.\r\n\r\nBe not weakly pleased at demonstrations of honour; strive not anxiously\r\nfor distinction; never let a thought of envy of those who do grave\r\nwrong cross thy mind; be never enviously jealous of others, or too\r\neager for money.\r\n\r\nHonour thy parents; make peace whenever thou canst among people, lead\r\nthem gently into the good path; place thy trust in, give thy company\r\nto, those who fear God.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nIF the means of thy support in life be measured out scantily to thee,\r\nremember that thou hast to be thankful and grateful even for the mere\r\nprivilege to breathe, and that thou must take up that suffering as a\r\ntest of thy piety and a preparation for better things. But if worldly\r\nwealth be lent to thee, exalt not thyself above thy brother; for both\r\nof ye came naked into the world, and both of ye will surely have to\r\nsleep at last together in the dust.\r\n\r\nBear well thy heart against the assaults of envy, which kills even\r\nsooner than death itself; and know no envy at all, save such envy of\r\nthe merits of virtuous men as shall lead thee to emulate the beauty of\r\ntheir lives. Surrender not thyself a slave to hate, that ruin of all\r\nthe heart’s good resolves, that destroyer of the very savour of food,\r\nof our sleep, of all reverence in our souls.\r\n\r\nKeep peace both within the city and without, for it goes well with all\r\nthose who are counsellors of peace; be wholly sincere; mislead no one\r\nby prevarications, by words smoother than intention, as little as by\r\ndirect falsehood. For God the Eternal is a God of Truth; it is He from\r\nwhom truth flowed first, He who begat truth and sent it into creation.\r\n\r\n                               ELEAZAR (ROKËACH) OF WORMS, _c._ 1200.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MYSTERY OF PAIN\r\n\r\nTHE mystery of pain is an old problem. The Rabbis were deeply impressed\r\nwith its gravity and complexity. The sorrows of the universe and the\r\nagony of Israel; the suffering of the nation and the pain of the\r\nindividual, formed the inspiration of some of their noblest thoughts.\r\nThey fully realized that suffering can chasten and heal and purify,\r\neven ‘as salt cleanses meat’. And so they call God’s chastisements\r\nthe blessed scourges of love, and tell us that even as the olive only\r\ngives forth its sweet and perfumed oil on being crushed, so also Israel\r\nonly reaches perfection through crushing sorrows. They tell us that\r\nin the thick darkness of the world-problem is God――the ‘Light Behind’;\r\nthat all things work together for good――even Death; they represent God\r\nas saying to mankind, ‘with thy very wounds I will heal thee’; they\r\nsay that those whom God afflicts bear His name; that only through a\r\n‘sorrow’s crown of sorrows’ cometh true life. Heaven is not to be won\r\nby rest and ease and quiet. Only those who have suffered and endured\r\ngreatly have achieved greatly. The world’s greatest workers, thinkers,\r\nand teachers have only reached the pinnacle of fame by surmounting\r\nobstacles which to ordinary men, content with the lower slopes, would\r\nhave seemed insuperable. Man has ever risen nearer to God by the\r\naltar-stairs of pain and sorrow――those altar-stairs which lead through\r\ndarkness, for ever upwards, towards the very Throne of God.\r\n\r\n                                                S. ALFRED ADLER, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MEETING ADVERSITY\r\n\r\nACCORDING to ancient Jewish custom, the ceremony of cutting our\r\ngarments when our nearest and dearest on earth is lying dead before\r\nus, is to be performed _standing up_. This teaches: meet all sorrow\r\nstanding upright. The future may be dark, veiled from the eye of\r\nmortals――but not the manner in which we are to meet the future. To\r\nrail at life, to rebel against a destiny that has cast our lines in\r\nunpleasant places, is of little avail. We cannot lay down terms to\r\nlife. Life must be accepted on its own terms. But hard as life’s terms\r\nare, life (it has been finely said) never dictates unrighteousness,\r\nunholiness, dishonour.\r\n\r\n                                                    J. H. HERTZ, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE CONTEMPLATION OF DEATH\r\n\r\nTHE contemplation of death should plant within the soul elevation and\r\npeace. Above all, it should make us see things in their true light. For\r\nall things which seem foolish in the light of death are really foolish\r\nin themselves. To be annoyed because So-and-so has slighted us or been\r\nsomewhat more successful in social distinctions, pulled himself somehow\r\none rung higher up the ladder than ourselves――how ridiculous all this\r\nseems when we couple it with the thought of death! To pass each day\r\nsimply and solely in the eager pursuit of money or of fame, this also\r\nseems like living with shadows when one might take one’s part with\r\nrealities. Surely when death is at hand we should desire to say, ‘I\r\nhave contributed my grain to the great store of the eternal. I have\r\nborne my part in the struggle for goodness.’ And let no man or woman\r\nsuppose that the smallest social act of goodness is wasted for society\r\nat large. All our help, petty though it be, is needed; and though we\r\nknow not the manner, the fruit of every faithful service is surely\r\ngathered in. Let the true and noble words of a great teacher ring in\r\nconclusion upon our ears: ‘The growing good of the world is partly\r\ndependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you\r\nand me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived\r\nfaithfully a hidden life and rest in unvisited tombs’.\r\n\r\n                                               C.

God then took\r\npity on him, and endowed him with the divine intuition to take two\r\nstones――the name of one was Darkness and the name of the other Shadow\r\nof Death――and rub them against each other, and so discover fire.\r\nThereupon Adam exclaimed with grateful joy: ‘Blessed be the Creator of\r\nLight’.\r\n\r\n                                                               TALMUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WHENCE AND WHITHER\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nAKABYA, son of Mahalalel, said, ‘Reflect upon three things, and thou\r\nwilt not come within the power of sin: know whence thou camest, and\r\nwhither thou art going, and before whom thou wilt in future have to\r\nrender account and reckoning’.\r\n\r\n                                                ETHICS OF THE FATHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nAN old Saxon chieftain was once revelling with his boon companions in\r\nthe brilliantly lighted banqueting hall, when he noticed a bird flying\r\nfrom end to end, and he exclaimed: ‘Even thus is our fate.

If we have risen to a true\r\nconception of life and our duty, if we have proved ourselves faithful\r\nto our mission, then our end will not be a leap in the dark, but――\r\n\r\n                       ‘Life’s race well run,\r\n                        Life’s work well done,\r\n                        Life’s crown well won’:\r\n\r\nthen come rest and peace――rest with God, peace everlasting.\r\n\r\n                                                  HERMANN ADLER, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TIME AND ETERNITY\r\n\r\nGOD, the Source of life, has placed in our nature the blessed hope of\r\nimmortality, by which we may console ourselves for the vanity of life,\r\nand overcome the dread of death. If thou art in truth of the higher\r\nsphere, why should the thought of leaving this lower region trouble\r\nthee? Especially since the very pleasures which thou seekest on earth\r\nare, in reality, but briars and thorns. Therefore seek them not. But\r\nwhat shouldst thou do? This: Use thy time as thou wouldst a doubtful\r\ncompanion: extract the good and avoid the evil. Avail thyself of the\r\nfew opportunities of improvement in his company, and use thy discretion\r\nso that thou mayest suffer no injury from thy association with him. And\r\nremember that the companionship of time is but of short duration. It\r\nflies more quickly than the shades of evening. We are like a child that\r\ngrasps in his hand a sunbeam. He opens his hand soon again, but, to his\r\namazement, finds it empty and the brightness gone.\r\n\r\n                                             YEDAYA PENINI, 14th cent.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHATSOEVER thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.\r\n\r\n                                                   ECCLESIASTES 9. 10.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nACCUSTOM thyself to complete any good work thou hast undertaken.\r\n\r\n                                         DERECH ERETZ ZUTTA, 8th cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TALMUDIC PARABLES AND LEGENDS\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n                    THE HEART ENNOBLES ANY CALLING\r\n\r\nRABBI BAROKA, a saintly mystic, one day as he was walking through the\r\ncrowded market-place of his town, met Elijah, the wandering spirit of\r\nprophecy in Jewish lore. ‘Who of all this multitude has the best claim\r\nto Heaven?’ asks the Rabbi of his spirit companion. The prophet points\r\nto a disreputable, weird-looking creature, a turnkey. ‘That man yonder,\r\nbecause he is considerate to his prisoners, and refrains from all\r\nunnecessary cruelty. In that miniature hell over which he presides he\r\nhas suppressed many a horror.’ ‘And who else is here sure of eternal\r\nlife?’ continues the Rabbi. Elijah then points to two motley-dressed\r\nfellows, clowns, who were supplying amusement to the bystanders. The\r\nRabbi’s astonishment knew no bounds. ‘Scorn them not,’ explains the\r\nprophet; ‘it is always their habit, even when not performing for hire,\r\nto cheer the depressed and the sorrowful. Whenever they see a sufferer\r\nthey join him, and by merry talk cause him to forget his grief.’\r\n\r\nThe heart ennobles any calling. A turnkey may leave the saintly behind\r\nin true merit of life; and a jester may be first in the kingdom of\r\nheaven, if disinterestedly he has diminished the sadness of human lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                     ‘WE LIVE IN DEEDS, NOT YEARS’\r\n\r\nA KING had a vineyard, and he hired a number of labourers, one of whom\r\nworked more diligently and better than the others. What did the king?\r\nHe took him by the hand and showed him friendship, and walked in the\r\nvineyard conversing with him. At eventide, all the labourers came to\r\nreceive their hire, and the king paid that labourer too for a full\r\nday’s work.\r\n\r\nThen were the other labourers sorely vexed. They said, ‘Behold, we have\r\nworked the whole day, whereas this one has only worked a few hours’.\r\n\r\nThen said the king, ‘Why do you speak thus? Consider. This one, in a\r\nfew hours, did more work for me than you who toiled the whole day long.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                               THE ACORN\r\n\r\nA RABBI was once passing through a field where he saw a very old man\r\nplanting an oak-tree. ‘Why are you planting that tree?’ said he. ‘You\r\nsurely do not expect to live long enough to see the acorn growing up\r\ninto an oak-tree?’\r\n\r\n‘Ah,’ replied the old man, ‘my ancestors planted trees not for\r\nthemselves, but for us, in order that we might enjoy their shade or\r\ntheir fruit. I am doing likewise for those who will come after me.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n                           EARTHLY TREASURES\r\n\r\nALEXANDER, the world conqueror, came across a simple people in\r\nAfrica who knew not war. He lingered to learn their ways. Two citizens\r\nappeared before their chief with this point of dispute: One had bought\r\na piece of land and discovered a treasure in it; he claimed that this\r\nbelonged to the seller, and wished to return it. The seller, on the\r\nother hand, declared that he sold the land with all it might contain.\r\nSo he refused to accept the treasure. The chief, turning to the buyer,\r\nsaid: ‘Thou hast a son?’ ‘Yes.’ And addressing the seller, ‘Thou hast\r\na daughter?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Marry one to the other and make the treasure\r\ntheir marriage portion.’ They left content. ‘In my country’, said the\r\nsurprised Alexander, ‘the disputants would have been imprisoned, and\r\nthe treasure confiscated for the king.’ ‘Is your country blessed by sun\r\nand rain?’ asked the chief. ‘Yes,’ replied Alexander. ‘Does it contain\r\ncattle?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Then it must be for the sake of these innocent animals\r\nthat the sun shines upon it; surely its people are unworthy of such\r\nblessing.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                  ALEXANDER AT THE GATES OF PARADISE\r\n\r\nALEXANDER the Great, in his travels in the East, one day wandered to\r\nthe gate of Paradise. He knocked, and the guardian angel asked, ‘Who\r\nis there?’ ‘Alexander,’ was the answer. ‘Who is Alexander?’ ‘Alexander,\r\nyou know――_the_ Alexander――Alexander the Great――Conqueror of the world.’\r\n‘We know him not――he cannot enter here. _This is the Lord’s gate; only\r\nthe righteous enter._’ Alexander then more humbly begged for something\r\nto show he had reached the heavenly gate, and a small fragment of a\r\nhuman skull was thrown to him, with the words, ‘Weigh it’. He took it\r\naway, and showed it contemptuously to his Wise Men, who brought a pair\r\nof scales, and, placing the bone in one, Alexander put some of his\r\nsilver and gold against it in the other; but the small bone outweighed\r\nthem all. More and more silver and gold were put into the scale, and\r\nat last all his crown jewels and diadems were in; but they all flew\r\nupwards like feathers before the weight of the bone, till one of the\r\nWise Men placed a few grains of dust on the bone. Up flew the scale!\r\nThe bone was that which surrounded the eye, and nothing will ever\r\nsatisfy the eye until covered by the dust of the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\n                          HEAVENLY TREASURES\r\n\r\nKING MONOBAZ, who in the days of the Second Temple became a proselyte\r\nto Judaism, unlocked his ancestral treasures at a time of famine, and\r\ndistributed them among the poor. His ministers rebuked him, saying,\r\n‘Thy fathers amassed, thou dost squander’. ‘Nay,’ said the benevolent\r\nking, ‘they preserved earthly, but I heavenly, treasures; theirs could\r\nbe stolen, mine are beyond mortal reach; theirs were barren, mine will\r\nbear fruit time without end; they preserved money, I have preserved\r\nlives. The treasures which my fathers laid by are for this world, mine\r\nare for eternity.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                              TOLERATION\r\n\r\nAn aged man, whom Abraham hospitably invited to his tent, refused\r\nto join him in prayer to the one spiritual God. Learning that he was\r\na fire-worshipper, Abraham drove him from his door. That night God\r\nappeared to Abraham in a vision and said: ‘I have borne with that\r\nignorant man for seventy years: could you not have patiently suffered\r\nhim one night?’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII\r\n\r\n                      THE TORAH IS ISRAEL’S LIFE\r\n\r\nONCE the Romans issued a decree that the Jews should no longer occupy\r\nthemselves in the study of the Torah. Rabbi Akiba, however, was most\r\nzealous in spreading a love and knowledge of the Torah amongst all the\r\nJewish communities. One day his friend Pappus met him and spake thus:\r\n‘Akiba, art thou not afraid? Thou surely must know that thy deeds will\r\nbring thee into mortal danger!’ ‘Stay a while!’ retorted Akiba, ‘let me\r\ntell thee a story: A fox was walking on the brink of a stream, in the\r\nclear waters of which were a number of fishes running to and fro. Said\r\nthe fox to the fishes, ‘Why do you run so?’ ‘We run’, replied they,\r\n‘because we fear the fishermen’s nets.’ ‘Come up on the dry land’, said\r\nthe fox, ‘and live with me in safety, even as my forefathers once lived\r\nin safety with yours.’ But the fishes said, ‘This surely is not the\r\ncleverest amongst animals that speaks thus. Water is our natural home.\r\nIf we are not safe there, how much less safe should we be on land,\r\nwhere we must surely die!’ It is exactly so with us Jews’, continued\r\nAkiba. ‘The Torah is our life and the length of our days. We may,\r\nwhilst loving and studying the Torah, be in great danger from our\r\nenemies; but if we were to give up its study, we should speedily\r\ndisappear and be no more.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX\r\n\r\n                           ISRAEL’S LOYALTY\r\n\r\nTHERE was once a man who betrothed himself to a beautiful maiden and\r\nthen went away, and the maiden waited and he came not. Friends and\r\nrivals mocked her and said, ‘He will never come’. She went into her\r\nroom and took out the letters in which he had promised to be ever\r\nfaithful. Weeping she read them and was comforted. In time he returned,\r\nand inquiring how she had kept her faith so long, she showed him his\r\nletters. Israel in misery, in captivity, was mocked by the nations\r\nfor her hopes of redemption; but Israel went into her schools and\r\nsynagogues and took out the letters, and was comforted. God would in\r\ntime redeem her and say, ‘How could you alone among all the mocking\r\nnations be faithful?’ Then Israel would point to the Law and the\r\nProphets and answer, ‘Had I not your promise here?’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n                              THE JEWELS\r\n\r\nRABBI MEIR sat during the whole of the Sabbath-day in the School\r\ninstructing the people. During his absence from the house his two\r\nsons died, both of them of uncommon beauty, and enlightened in the Law.\r\nHis wife bore them to her bedchamber, and spread a white covering over\r\ntheir bodies. In the evening Rabbi Meir came home. ‘Where are my sons?’\r\nhe asked. ‘I repeatedly looked round the School, and I did not see them\r\nthere.’ She reached him a goblet. He praised the Lord at the going out\r\nof the Sabbath, drank, and again asked: ‘Where are my sons?’ ‘They will\r\nnot be afar off’, she said, and placed food before him that he might\r\neat. When he had said grace after the meal, she thus addressed him:\r\n‘With thy permission, I would fain propose to thee one question’. ‘Ask\r\nit then’, he replied. ‘A few days ago a person entrusted some jewels\r\ninto my custody, and now he demands them of me; should I give them back\r\nagain?’ ‘This is a question’, said the Rabbi, ‘which my wife should\r\nnot have thought it necessary to ask. What! wouldst thou hesitate to\r\nrestore to every one his own?’ ‘No,’ she replied; ‘but yet I thought\r\nit best not to restore them without acquainting you therewith.’ She\r\nthen led him to the chamber, and took the white covering from the\r\ndead bodies. ‘Ah, my sons! my sons!’ loudly lamented the father. ‘My\r\nsons! the light of my eyes!’ The mother turned away and wept bitterly.\r\nAt length she took her husband by the hand, and said: ‘Didst thou\r\nnot teach me that we must not be reluctant to restore that which was\r\nentrusted to our keeping? See――the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken\r\naway; blessed be the name of the Lord!’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI\r\n\r\n                             THE TWO SHIPS\r\n\r\nTWO ships were once seen to be sailing near land. One of them was\r\ngoing forth from the harbour, and the other was coming into the harbour.\r\nEvery one was cheering the outgoing ship, and every one was giving it a\r\nhearty send-off. But the incoming ship was scarcely noticed.\r\n\r\nA wise man was looking at the two ships, and he said: ‘Rejoice not\r\nover the ship that is setting out to sea, for you know not what destiny\r\nawaits it, what storms it may encounter, what dangers it may have to\r\nundergo. Rejoice rather over the ship that has reached port safely and\r\nbrought back all its passengers in peace.’\r\n\r\nIt is the way of the world, that when a human being is born, all\r\nrejoice; but when he dies, all sorrow. Rather ought the opposite to be\r\nthe case. No one can tell what troubles await the child on its journey\r\ninto manhood. But when a man has lived and dies in peace, all should\r\nrejoice, seeing that he has completed his journey, and is departing\r\nthis world with the imperishable crown of a good name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n\r\n                     THE MAN AND HIS THREE FRIENDS\r\n\r\nA CERTAIN man had three friends, two of whom he loved dearly, but the\r\nother he lightly esteemed. It happened one day that the king commanded\r\nhis presence at court, at which he was greatly alarmed, and wished to\r\nprocure an advocate. Accordingly he went to the two friends whom he\r\nloved; one flatly refused to accompany him, the other offered to go\r\nwith him as far as the king’s gate, but no farther. In his extremity he\r\ncalled upon the third friend, whom he least esteemed, and he not only\r\nwent willingly with him, but so ably defended him before the king that\r\nhe was acquitted.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, every man has three friends when Death summons him\r\nto appear before his Creator. His first friend, whom he loves most,\r\nnamely, his money, cannot go with him a single step; his second,\r\nrelations and neighbours, can only accompany him to the grave, but\r\ncannot defend him before the Judge; while his third friend, whom he\r\ndoes not highly esteem――his good works――goes with him before the King,\r\nand obtains his acquittal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XIII\r\n\r\n                       VANITY OF HUMAN PLEASURE\r\n\r\nA FOX was eyeing longingly some luscious fruit in a very fine garden.\r\nBut there was no way for him to enter. At last he espied an opening\r\nthrough which, he thought, he might possibly get in, but soon found the\r\nhole too small to admit his body. ‘True,’ he said, ‘the hole is small,\r\nbut if I fast three days my body will become sufficiently reduced to\r\nadmit me.’ He did so; and to his joy he now feasted to his heart’s\r\ncontent upon the grapes and all the other good things in the orchard.\r\nBut lo! when he desired to escape before the master of the garden came\r\nupon him he saw, to his great consternation, that the opening had again\r\nbecome too small for him. Poor animal! he had a second time to fast\r\nthree days; and having made good his escape, he cast a farewell glance\r\nupon the scene of his late revels, saying: ‘O garden, charming art thou\r\nand exquisite are thy fruits! But of what avail hast thou been unto me?\r\nWhat have I now for all my labour and cunning?’\r\n\r\nIt is even so with man. Naked he comes into the world, naked he must\r\nleave it. Of all his toil therein he carries nothing away with him save\r\nthe fruits of his good deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n\r\n                             BODY AND SOUL\r\n\r\nTHE Roman Emperor Antoninus once said to Rabbi Judah the Prince, ‘On\r\nthe great Day of Judgement, soul and body will each plead excuse for\r\nsin committed. The body will say to the Heavenly Judge, “It is the soul,\r\nand not I, that has sinned. Without it I am as lifeless as a stone.” On\r\nthe other hand, the soul will say, “How canst Thou impute sin to me? It\r\nis the body that has dragged me down.”’\r\n\r\n‘Let me tell you a parable’, answered Rabbi Judah the Prince. ‘A king\r\nonce had a beautiful garden stocked with the choicest fruits. He set\r\ntwo men to keep guard over it――a blind man and a lame man. “I see some\r\nfine fruit yonder”, said the lame man one day. “Come up on my shoulder”,\r\nsaid the blind man, “I will carry you to the spot, and we shall both\r\nenjoy the fruit.” The owner, missing the fruit, haled both men before\r\nhim for punishment. “How could I have been the thief?” queried the\r\nlame man, “seeing that I cannot walk?” “Could I have stolen the fruit?”\r\nretorted the blind man; “I am unable to see anything.” What did the\r\nking? He placed the lame man on the shoulders of the blind man and\r\nsentenced them both as one.’\r\n\r\nIn the same way will the Divine Judge of the Universe mete out\r\njudgement to body and soul jointly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ALMIGHTY, WHAT IS MAN?\r\n\r\n        ALMIGHTY! what is man?\r\n        But flesh and blood.\r\n        Like shadows flee his days,\r\n        He marks not how they vanish from his gaze,\r\n        Now like a flower blowing,\r\n        Now scorched by sunbeams glowing.\r\n        And wilt Thou of his trespasses inquire?\r\n        How may he ever bear\r\n        Thine anger just, Thy vengeance dire?\r\n        Then spare him, be Thou merciful, O King,\r\n        Upon the dreaded day of reckoning!\r\n\r\n        Almighty! what is man?\r\n        A faded leaf!\r\n        If Thou dost weigh him in the balance――lo!\r\n        He disappears――a breath that thou dost blow.\r\n        His heart is ever filled\r\n        With lust of lies unstilled.\r\n        Wilt Thou bear in mind his crime\r\n        Unto all time?\r\n        He fades away like clouds sun-kissed,\r\n        Dissolves like mist.\r\n        Then spare him! let him love and mercy win,\r\n        According to Thy grace, and not according to his sin!\r\n\r\n                                    SOLOMON IBN GABIROL, 1050.\r\n                                     (_Trans.

This has been the fate of\r\n          Israel in every age; and the world’s habit of identifying\r\n          the race with the shortcomings of the individual seems to\r\n          be ineradicable. Public transgression――transgression which\r\n          involves the whole House of Israel――is in a special sense\r\n          branded as a _Chillul Hashem_, as “a profanation of the\r\n          Name” just as good deeds, done publicly, which reflect\r\n          lustre on all Israel, are praised as a _Kiddush Hashem_,\r\n          “a sanctification of the Name”.’ (Morris Joseph, _Judaism as\r\n          Life and Creed_. 3rd Edition.

It is true that occasional unions\r\n          between Jew and Gentile do no appreciable harm to the Jewish\r\n          cause, however much mischief they may lay up, in the shape\r\n          of jealousy and dissension, for those who contract them,\r\n          and of religious confusion, for the children. But a general\r\n          practice begins as a rule by being occasional. Every Jew who\r\n          contemplates marriage outside the pale must regard himself\r\n          as paving the way to a disruption which will be the final,\r\n          as it will be the culminating, disaster in the history of\r\n          his people.’\r\n\r\n   12.

Its songs have an elemental\r\n          appeal――they represent the collective outcry of a suffering,\r\n          unbendable race.’ (Schindler.)\r\n\r\n   13.  Cohen: Preface, _Children’s Psalm Book._ (Routledge.)\r\n        The following words recently written by America’s leading\r\n          educationist are of deep significance:――‘Education the world\r\n          over was at first for a long time almost solely religious,\r\n          and, while it was once a master-stroke of toleration to\r\n          eliminate it from the school, in doing so we nearly lost\r\n          from our educational system the greatest of all the motives\r\n          that makes for virtue, reverence, self-knowledge and\r\n          self-control. Now we are beginning to realize the wrong\r\n          we have committed against child-nature and are seeking\r\n          in various ways to atone for it.’ (G. Stanley Hall, in\r\n          Introduction to L. Grossmann’s _The Aims of Teaching in\r\n          Jewish Schools_, Cincinnati, 1919.)\r\n        Cf. the chapter on Religious Education with Bibliography\r\n          in M.

Yea, let us be like all the other nations,\r\n          unashamed of the rock whence we have been hewn; like the\r\n          rest, holding dear our language and the honour of our people.\r\n          We need not blush for clinging to the ancient language with\r\n          which we wandered from land to land, in which our poets sang,\r\n          and our seers prophesied, and in which our fathers poured\r\n          out their hearts unto God.

We can carry the legend\r\n          further. The precious stones were picked up by the various\r\n          religions and philosophies of the world. Each claimed and\r\n          claims that its own fragment alone reflects the light of\r\n          heaven. In God’s own time we shall, all of us, fit our\r\n          fragments together and reconstruct the Gates of Paradise.\r\n          Through the gates shall all peoples pass to the foot of\r\n          God’s throne.

If we choose the latter,\r\n          then all nature will catch a reflected light from the glory\r\n          of the moral aims of man.\r\n        ‘The Hebrew Prophets chose the latter alternative. They\r\n          asserted the freedom of man; and the general conscience of\r\n          mankind, despite all cavilings and sophistry to the contrary,\r\n          has ever responded to their declaration with a loud Amen.\r\n          They argued, to put their thought in modern language, that\r\n          we may fairly judge of the whole course of evolution by its\r\n          highest outcome, and they believed its highest outcome to be,\r\n          not mere mechanical order of beauty, but righteousness.\r\n\r\n        ‘The Hebrew Prophets interpreted the universe in terms of\r\n          humanity’s aspirations. They believe that the ends of\r\n          justice are too precious to be lost; that, if righteousness\r\n          is not yet real in the world, it must be made real; and,\r\n          hence, that there must be a Power in the world which makes\r\n          for righteousness.’\r\n\r\n   68.

Better than any abstract definition is\r\n          a concrete record taken haphazard of an actual pogrom.\r\n          Orscha is a town of 14,000 inhabitants, half of them Jews.\r\n          On October 18, 1905, the news of the proclamation of the\r\n          Constitution reached Orscha. On the 19th the general strike\r\n          stopped; Jew and Christian embraced; the houses were hung\r\n          with flags, a service of thanksgiving was held; processions\r\n          filled the streets. In the evening the Mohilev police\r\n          officer Misgaib entered the town, and the rumour ran round\r\n          that a patriotic demonstration was to take place and the\r\n          Jews to be beaten. On the 20th, drunken men gathered to\r\n          take the official’s orders. On the morning of the 21st, the\r\n          peasants entered the town armed with axes and guns. “The\r\n          village authorities have sent us; whoever does not come\r\n          will be punished. We are to do whatever is ordered.” At\r\n          one o’clock a priest exhorted the crowds of the faithful\r\n          to purge their city of the aliens, and the cry arose, “Long\r\n          live absolutism! Down with the mayor, who has sold the town\r\n          to the Jews”. The first murders followed. The house of a\r\n          rich Jew was stormed. Without the soldiers fired, a priest\r\n          held service, and a band played the national anthem; while\r\n          within eight men, women and children were tortured to death.\r\n          The appetite was only whetted. At six o’clock the peasants\r\n          begged the police for more orders, more work. They were told\r\n          to wait till daylight; the darkness might encourage the Jews\r\n          to resist. On the same day twelve Jewish youths came from\r\n          Shklov to help their brethren. They were met at the station\r\n          and murdered, and for seven hours every man that passed\r\n          mutilated or insulted their dead bodies. The massacre became\r\n          general. The 23rd was given up to plunder. At mid-day the\r\n          Vice-Governor spoke to the crowds: “Children, it is enough.\r\n          You have had three days’ amusement, now go home and sing\r\n          ‘God save the Czar’”. The pogrom at Orscha was typical of\r\n          the 690 greater and lesser pogroms which took place that\r\n          October.’ (H. Sacher on ‘Die Judenpogromme in Russland’.\r\n          _Jewish Review_, i.)\r\n\r\n  106.

More than 100,000 Jews――men, women,\r\n          and children――have been butchered in cold blood by the\r\n          hordes under Generals Denikin and Petlura. The soldiery,\r\n          intoxicated with blood, invented the most diabolical\r\n          tortures. See the Report on Jewish Pogroms by Kieff Pogrom\r\n          Relief Committee, controlled by the Russian Red Cross,\r\n          London, 1920. ‘Our masses in Eastern Europe have been facing\r\n          death in seven circles of hell. It is sufficient to remember\r\n          the multi-massacres of Ukrainia. For this cold murder of\r\n          whole communities not Heaven itself nor all the mercy of\r\n          the angels could find palliation. There is no instance that\r\n          shows so much as this the ghastly descent of human character\r\n          into primitive brutality and cannibalism. This is a deed\r\n          which in its horror and wicked purposelessness should have\r\n          stunned the world.’ (Nahum Sokolow, Opening Address of\r\n          London Zionist Conference, July 7, 1920.) The following\r\n          stanzas are from Mr. Zangwill’s appeal to American Jewry on\r\n          behalf of the victims:――\r\n\r\n                                OUR OWN\r\n\r\n                By devastated dwellings,\r\n                By desecrated fanes,\r\n                By hearth-stones, cold and crimsoned,\r\n                And slaughter-reeking lanes,\r\n                Again is the Hebrew quarter\r\n                Through half of Europe known;\r\n                And crouching in the shambles,\r\n                Rachel, the ancient crone,\r\n                Weeps again for her children\r\n                  and the fate that is her own.\r\n\r\n                No laughter rings in these ruins\r\n                Save of girls to madness shamed.\r\n                Their mothers disembowelled\r\n                Lie stark ’mid children maimed.\r\n                The Shool has a great congregation\r\n                But never a psalm they drone.\r\n                Shrouded in red-striped Tallisim,\r\n                Levi huddles with Kohn;\r\n                But the blood from their bodies oozing\r\n                  is the blood that is your own.\r\n\r\n                Shot, some six to the bullet,\r\n                Lashed and trailed in the dust,\r\n                Mutilated with hatchets\r\n                In superbestial lust――\r\n                No beast can even imagine\r\n                What Christians do or condone――\r\n                Surely these bear our burden\r\n                And for our sins atone,\r\n                And if we hide our faces,\r\n                  then the guilt is as our own.\r\n\r\n                At last but a naked rabble,\r\n                Clawing the dust for bread,\r\n                Jabbering, wailing, whining,\r\n                Hordes of the living dead,\r\n                Half apes, half ghosts, they grovel,\r\n                Nor human is their tone,\r\n                Yet they are not brutes but brethren,\r\n                These wrecks of the hunger-zone,\r\n                And their death-cry rings to heaven\r\n                  in the tongue that is your own.\r\n\r\n  107.

Peretz offers gladly all he\r\n          has, his genius, in the service of the lowly. Literature,\r\n          according to him, is a consolation to those who have no\r\n          other consolation, a safe and pleasurable retreat for those\r\n          who are buffeted about on the stormy sea of life. For these\r\n          reasons he prefers to dwell with the down-trodden and the\r\n          submerged.’ (Wiener).\r\n\r\n  117.  Cf.

They\r\n          found a powerful echo in the United States, where a young\r\n          Jewish poetess, Miss Emma Lazarus, passionately championed\r\n          the Zionist cause in verse not unworthy of Yehudah Halevi.’\r\n          (Lucien Wolf, _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, ‘Zionism’.)\r\n\r\n  119.  _Seminary Addresses_, ‘Zionism’.\r\n\r\n  120.  _Selected Essays_, ‘Moses’.\r\n\r\n  123.  _Jewish Review_, I.\r\n\r\n  124.  Herzl: ‘Herzl’s personal charm was irresistible. His sincerity,\r\n          his eloquence, his tact, his devotion, his power, were\r\n          recognized on all hands. He spent his whole strength in the\r\n          furtherance of his ideas. Diplomatic interviews, exhausting\r\n          journeys, impressive mass meetings, brilliant literary\r\n          propaganda――all these methods were employed by him to the\r\n          utmost limit of self-denial. He was beyond question the most\r\n          influential Jewish personality of the nineteenth century.\r\n          He effectively roused Jews all the world over to an earnest\r\n          and vital interest in their present and their future. Herzl\r\n          thus left an indelible mark on his time, and his renown\r\n          is assured whatever be the fate in store for the political\r\n          Zionism which he founded and for which he gave his life.’ (I.\r\n          Abrahams in _Encyclopaedia Britannica_.)\r\n\r\n  125.

Cornill: In the same masterly address, _Humanity in the Old\r\n          Testament_, this great Biblical scholar says:――\r\n        ‘But not only to man does the humanitarianism of the Torah\r\n          extend, it cares for the brute as well, and places it\r\n          likewise under legal protection, to which I know of no\r\n          analogy in older extra-Israelitish codes. The Israelite\r\n          ascribed a soul even to the brute, and saw in it a creature\r\n          of God, which, while subservient to man by God, yet should\r\n          not be helplessly exposed to his caprice. What a truly\r\n          humanitarian sentiment finds expression in the Law; “Thou\r\n          shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn”.\r\n          The brute should not perform hard labour, and at the same\r\n          time have food before its eyes, without the possibility of\r\n          eating therefrom. I remember some time ago, to have read\r\n          that one of the richest Italian real-estate owners, at\r\n          the grape-harvest, fastened iron muzzles to his miserable,\r\n          fever-stricken workmen, so that it might not occur to these\r\n          poor peasants, working for starvation wages under the glowing\r\n          sun of Southern Italy, to satiate their burning thirst and\r\n          their gnawing hunger with a few of the millions of grapes of\r\n          the owner.’\r\n\r\n  132.  _Literature and Dogma_, 1, 4, and xi, 6.\r\n\r\n  133.  _History of the People of Israel._ Preface.\r\n\r\n  134.

The annals of savagery\r\n          and superstition unhappily compose a large part of human\r\n          literature; but in what other volume shall we find, side by\r\n          side with that melancholy record, psalmists who poured forth\r\n          their sweet and solemn strains of meditative piety in the\r\n          solitude of the hills or in green pastures and beside still\r\n          waters; prophets who lit up their beatific visions of a\r\n          blissful future with the glow of an impassioned imagination;\r\n          historians who bequeathed to distant ages the scenes of a\r\n          remote past embalmed for ever in the amber of a pellucid\r\n          style? These are the true glories of the Old Testament and\r\n          of Israel.’\r\n\r\n  139.  Huxley: _Educational Essays_.\r\n\r\n  140.  Huxley: ‘From the free spirit of the Mosaic law sprang the\r\n          intensity of family life that amid all dispersions and\r\n          persecutions has preserved the individuality of the Hebrew\r\n          race; that love of independence that under the most adverse\r\n          circumstance has characterized the Jew; that burning\r\n          patriotism that flamed up in the Maccabees and bared the\r\n          breasts of Jewish peasants to the serried steel of Grecian\r\n          phalanx and the resistless onset of Roman legion; that\r\n          stubborn courage that in exile and in torture held the\r\n          Jew to his faith. It kindled that fire that has made the\r\n          strains of Hebrew seers and poets phrase for us the highest\r\n          exaltations of thought; that intellectual vigour that has\r\n          over and over again made the dry staff bud and blossom.\r\n          And it has exerted its power wherever the influence of the\r\n          Hebrew scriptures has been felt. It has toppled thrones and\r\n          cast down hierarchies.’ (Henry George.)\r\n\r\n  141.

This volume has been translated into most Western\r\n          languages. ‘It was left for a Russian Jew at the end of\r\n          the nineteenth century to see and paint hell in colours not\r\n          attempted by anyone since the days of Dante ... the hell\r\n          he has not only visited, but that he has lived through.’\r\n          (Wiener.)\r\n\r\n  214.  _The Sinaist_, 1, 2. ‘The Torah――our Greatest Benefactor.’\r\n\r\n  216.  _The Sinaist_, 1, 3.\r\n\r\n                               TEPHILLIN\r\n\r\n                Erect he stands, in fervent prayer,\r\n                  His body cloaked in silken Tallis;\r\n                He seems a king, so free from care,\r\n                  His wife a queen, his home a palace.\r\n\r\n                These bands he wears and softly prays,\r\n                  Devoting strength and mind to God;\r\n                His body slowly, gently sways――\r\n                  He walks the ground his fathers trod.\r\n\r\n                This daily commune with the Master\r\n                  Lifts him above mere common clay;\r\n                The Jewish heart, like alabaster,\r\n                  Grows pure and purer every day.\r\n\r\n                 (Aaron Schaffer in _Standard Book of\r\n              Jewish Verses_, New York, Dodd, Mead & Co.)\r\n\r\n  217.  _Sun and Shield_――a book of devout thoughts for everyday use.\r\n          Bloch Publishing Co., New York.\r\n\r\n  218.  _The Occident_, vol. 12.

The\r\n          Jewish idea of faith is that of fidelity, absolute loyalty\r\n          to God. ‘Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.’\r\n        Young Sorley, writing a few days before he fell in battle,\r\n          says: ‘Real faith is not that which says “we _must_ win for\r\n          our cause is just”; but that which says “our cause is just;\r\n          therefore we can disregard defeat”. All outlooks are at\r\n          present material, and the unseen value of justice as justice,\r\n          independent entirely of results, is forgotten. It is looked\r\n          upon merely as an agent for winning battles.’ (_Letters of\r\n          Charles Sorley_, 1919.)\r\n\r\n  220.  Halevi’s Ode to Zion is one of the noblest religious poems in\r\n          the literature of the World:――\r\n\r\n              Pure and faithful, ever spotless,\r\n              Was his song, even as his soul was;\r\n              Soul, that when the Maker fashioned,\r\n              With His handiwork delighted.\r\n\r\n              Straight He kissed the beauteous spirit;\r\n              And that kiss of grace, re-echoing,\r\n              Fills with music all his singing,\r\n              Whom it consecrated――poet.

From _The Royal Crown_, Gabirol’s best known and most\r\n          important composition, containing his thoughts on religion\r\n          and philosophy, and expressing all his ardent love of God. In\r\n          many congregations, this poem is recited at the conclusion of\r\n          the Eve of Atonement (Kol Nidra) Service.\r\n\r\n  240.  _Abodath Yisrael_, by Szold and Jastrow, Philadelphia, 1873.\r\n\r\n  241.  _Poems of Emma Lazarus_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n  249.

They force us to learn that which it\r\n          is wholesome for us to know, but which habitually we try to\r\n          ignore, namely, that really we have no claim on a long life;\r\n          that we are each of us liable to be called off at any moment,\r\n          and that the main point is not how long we live, but with\r\n          what meaning we fill the short allotted span――for short it\r\n          is at best.\r\n        As in every battle, so in the great battle of Humanity,\r\n          the fallen and wounded, too, have a share in the victory;\r\n          by their sufferings they have helped, and the greenest\r\n          wreaths belong to them.’ (Felix Adler in _Life and Destiny_,\r\n          New York.

Therefore, let it\r\n          be known, understood and remembered, that He, the Almighty,\r\n          is the Maker and the Creator; He is the Discerner, He\r\n          the Judge, He the Witness, He the Complainant; and that\r\n          He shall judge in the hereafter, before whom there is no\r\n          unrighteousness, and no forgetting, no regard for rank, no\r\n          taking of bribes. Know that all is according to reckoning.\r\n          Let not thy passions persuade thee that the grave will\r\n          be a place of refuge for thee. For without thy will wert\r\n          thou created, without thy will thou wast born; thou livest\r\n          perforce, and perforce thou shalt at last die, and perforce\r\n          thou shalt in the future have to give account before the\r\n          Supreme King, the Holy One, blessed be He.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     INDEX OF AUTHORS AND SOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\n               † Indicates translators or translations.\r\n\r\n                               I――JEWISH\r\n\r\n  ABRAHAM ibn EZRA.
