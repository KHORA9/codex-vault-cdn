The Slender Story of his Life is curiously twined about that\r\nof two other very considerable Figures in their Time and Country: one\r\nof whom tells the Story of all Three.  This was Nizam ul Mulk, Vizier\r\nto Alp Arslan the Son, and Malik Shah the Grandson, of Toghrul Beg the\r\nTartar, who had wrested Persia from the feeble Successor of Mahmud the\r\nGreat, and founded that Seljukian Dynasty which finally roused Europe\r\ninto the Crusades.  This Nizam ul Mulk, in his Wasiyat--or\r\nTestament--which he wrote and left as a Memorial for future\r\nStatesmen--relates the following, as quoted in the Calcutta Review,\r\nNo. 59, from Mirkhond's History of the Assassins.\r\n\r\n\"'One of the greatest of the wise men of Khorassan was the Imam\r\nMowaffak of Naishapur, a man highly honored and reverenced,--may God\r\nrejoice his soul; his illustrious years exceeded eighty-five, and it\r\nwas the universal belief that every boy who read the Koran or studied\r\nthe traditions in his presence, would assuredly attain to honor and\r\nhappiness.  For this cause did my father send me from Tus to Naishapur\r\nwith Abd-us-samad, the doctor of law, that I might employ myself in\r\nstudy and learning under the guidance of that illustrious teacher.\r\nTowards me he ever turned an eye of favor and kindness, and as his\r\npupil I felt for him extreme affection and devotion, so that I passed\r\nfour years in his service.  When I first came there, I found two other\r\npupils of mine own age newly arrived, Hakim Omar Khayyam, and the ill-\r\nfated Ben Sabbah.  Both were endowed with sharpness of wit and the\r\nhighest natural powers; and we three formed a close friendship\r\ntogether.  When the Imam rose from his lectures, they used to join me,\r\nand we repeated to each other the lessons we had heard.  Now Omar was\r\na native of Naishapur, while Hasan Ben Sabbah's father was one Ali, a\r\nman of austere life and practise, but heretical in his creed and\r\ndoctrine.  One day Hasan said to me and to Khayyam, \"It is a universal\r\nbelief that the pupils of the Imam Mowaffak will attain to fortune.\r\nNow, even if we all do not attain thereto, without doubt one of us\r\nwill; what then shall be our mutual pledge and bond?\"  We answered,\r\n\"Be it what you please.\"  \"Well,\" he said, \"let us make a vow, that to\r\nwhomsoever this fortune falls, he shall share it equally with the\r\nrest, and reserve no pre-eminence for himself.\"  \"Be it so,\" we both\r\nreplied, and on those terms we mutually pledged our words.  Years\r\nrolled on, and I went from Khorassan to Transoxiana, and wandered to\r\nGhazni and Cabul; and when I returned, I was invested with office, and\r\nrose to be administrator of affairs during the Sultanate of Sultan Alp\r\nArslan.'\r\n\r\n\"He goes on to state, that years passed by, and both his old school-\r\nfriends found him out, and came and claimed a share in his good\r\nfortune, according to the school-day vow.  The Vizier was generous and\r\nkept his word.  Hasan demanded a place in the government, which the\r\nSultan granted at the Vizier's request; but discontented with a\r\ngradual rise, he plunged into the maze of intrigue of an oriental\r\ncourt, and, failing in a base attempt to supplant his benefactor, he\r\nwas disgraced and fell.  After many mishaps and wanderings, Hasan\r\nbecame the head of the Persian sect of the Ismailians,--a party of\r\nfanatics who had long murmured in obscurity, but rose to an evil\r\neminence under the guidance of his strong and evil will.  In A.D.\r\n1090, he seized the castle of Alamut, in the province of Rudbar, which\r\nlies in the mountainous tract south of the Caspian Sea; and it was\r\nfrom this mountain home he obtained that evil celebrity among the\r\nCrusaders as the OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAINS, and spread terror through\r\nthe Mohammedan world; and it is yet disputed where the word Assassin,\r\nwhich they have left in the language of modern Europe as their dark\r\nmemorial, is derived from the hashish, or opiate of hemp-leaves (the\r\nIndian bhang), with which they maddened themselves to the sullen pitch\r\nof oriental desperation, or from the name of the founder of the\r\ndynasty, whom we have seen in his quiet collegiate days, at Naishapur.\r\nOne of the countless victims of the Assassin's dagger was Nizam ul\r\nMulk himself, the old school-boy friend.[1]\r\n\r\n\"Omar Khayyam also came to the Vizier to claim his share; but not to\r\nask for title or office.  'The greatest boon you can confer on me,' he\r\nsaid, 'is to let me live in a corner under the shadow of your fortune,\r\nto spread wide the advantages of Science, and pray for your long life\r\nand prosperity.'  The Vizier tells us, that when he found Omar was\r\nreally sincere in his refusal, he pressed him no further, but granted\r\nhim a yearly pension of 1200 mithkals of gold from the treasury of\r\nNaishapur.\r\n\r\n\"At Naishapur thus lived and died Omar Khayyam, 'busied,' adds the\r\nVizier, 'in winning knowledge of every kind, and especially in\r\nAstronomy, wherein he attained to a very high pre-eminence.  Under the\r\nSultanate of Malik Shah, he came to Merv, and obtained great praise\r\nfor his proficiency in science, and the Sultan showered favors upon\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n\"When the Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, Omar was one\r\nof the eight learned men employed to do it; the result was the Jalali\r\nera (so called from Jalal-ud-din, one of the king's names)--'a\r\ncomputation of time,' says Gibbon, 'which surpasses the Julian, and\r\napproaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style.'  He is also the\r\nauthor of some astronomical tables, entitled 'Ziji-Malikshahi,' and\r\nthe French have lately republished and translated an Arabic Treatise\r\nof his on Algebra.\r\n\r\n\"His Takhallus or poetical name (Khayyam) signifies a Tent-maker, and\r\nhe is said to have at one time exercised that trade, perhaps before\r\nNizam-ul-Mulk's generosity raised him to independence.  Many Persian\r\npoets similarly derive their names from their occupations; thus we\r\nhave Attar, 'a druggist,' Assar, 'an oil presser,' etc.[2]  Omar\r\nhimself alludes to his name in the following whimsical lines:--\r\n\r\n \"'Khayyam, who stitched the tents of science,\r\n   Has fallen in grief's furnace and been suddenly burned;\r\n   The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life,\r\n   And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing!'\r\n\r\n\"We have only one more anecdote to give of his Life, and that relates\r\nto the close; it is told in the anonymous preface which is sometimes\r\nprefixed to his poems; it has been printed in the Persian in the\r\nAppendix to Hyde's Veterum Persarum Religio, p. 499; and D'Herbelot\r\nalludes to it in his Bibliotheque, under Khiam.[3]--\r\n\r\n\"'It is written in the chronicles of the ancients that this King of\r\nthe Wise, Omar Khayyam, died at Naishapur in the year of the Hegira,\r\n517 (A.D. 1123); in science he was unrivaled,--the very paragon of his\r\nage.  Khwajah Nizami of Samarcand, who was one of his pupils, relates\r\nthe following story: \"I often used to hold conversations with my\r\nteacher, Omar Khayyam, in a garden; and one day he said to me,\r\n'My tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses\r\nover it.'  I wondered at the words he spake, but I knew that his were\r\nno idle words.[4]  Years after, when I chanced to revisit Naishapur, I\r\nwent to his final resting-place, and lo! it was just outside a garden,\r\nand trees laden with fruit stretched their boughs over the garden\r\nwall, and dropped their flowers upon his tomb, so that the stone was\r\nhidden under them.\"'\"\r\n\r\nThus far--without fear of Trespass--from the Calcutta Review.  The\r\nwriter of it, on reading in India this story of Omar's Grave, was\r\nreminded, he says, of Cicero's Account of finding Archimedes' Tomb at\r\nSyracuse, buried in grass and weeds.  I think Thorwaldsen desired to\r\nhave roses grow over him; a wish religiously fulfilled for him to the\r\npresent day, I believe.  However, to return to Omar.\r\n\r\nThough the Sultan \"shower'd Favors upon him,\" Omar's Epicurean\r\nAudacity of Thought and Speech caused him to be regarded askance in\r\nhis own Time and Country.  He is said to have been especially hated\r\nand dreaded by the Sufis, whose Practise he ridiculed, and whose Faith\r\namounts to little more than his own, when stript of the Mysticism and\r\nformal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide.  Their\r\nPoets, including Hafiz, who are (with the exception of Firdausi) the\r\nmost considerable in Persia, borrowed largely, indeed, of Omar's\r\nmaterial, but turning it to a mystical Use more convenient to\r\nThemselves and the People they addressed; a People quite as quick of\r\nDoubt as of Belief; as keen of Bodily sense as of Intellectual; and\r\ndelighting in a cloudy composition of both, in which they could float\r\nluxuriously between Heaven and Earth, and this World and the Next, on\r\nthe wings of a poetical expression, that might serve indifferently for\r\neither.  Omar was too honest of Heart as well of Head for this.\r\nHaving failed (however mistakenly) of finding any Providence but\r\nDestiny, and any World but This, he set about making the most of it;\r\npreferring rather to soothe the Soul through the Senses into\r\nAcquiescence with Things as he saw them, than to perplex it with vain\r\ndisquietude after what they might be.  It has been seen, however, that\r\nhis Worldly Ambition was not exorbitant; and he very likely takes a\r\nhumorous or perverse pleasure in exalting the gratification of Sense\r\nabove that of the Intellect, in which he must have taken great\r\ndelight, although it failed to answer the Questions in which he, in\r\ncommon with all men, was most vitally interested.\r\n\r\nFor whatever Reason, however, Omar as before said, has never been\r\npopular in his own Country, and therefore has been but scantily\r\ntransmitted abroad.  The MSS. of his Poems, mutilated beyond the\r\naverage Casualties of Oriental Transcription, are so rare in the East\r\nas scarce to have reacht Westward at all, in spite of all the\r\nacquisitions of Arms and Science.  There is no copy at the India\r\nHouse, none at the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris.  We know but of\r\none in England: No. 140 of the Ouseley MSS. at the Bodleian, written\r\nat Shiraz, A.D. 1460.  This contains but 158 Rubaiyat.  One in the\r\nAsiatic Society's Library at Calcutta (of which we have a Copy),\r\ncontains (and yet incomplete) 516, though swelled to that by all kinds\r\nof Repetition and Corruption.  So Von Hammer speaks of his Copy as\r\ncontaining about 200, while Dr. Sprenger catalogues the Lucknow MS. at\r\ndouble that number.[5]  The Scribes, too, of the Oxford and Calcutta\r\nMSS. seem to do their Work under a sort of Protest; each beginning\r\nwith a Tetrastich (whether genuine or not), taken out of its\r\nalphabetical order; the Oxford with one of Apology; the Calcutta with\r\none of Expostulation, supposed (says a Notice prefixed to the MS.)\r\nto have arisen from a Dream, in which Omar's mother asked about his\r\nfuture fate.  It may be rendered thus:--\r\n\r\n \"O Thou who burn'st in Heart for those who burn\r\n  In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn,\r\n    How long be crying, 'Mercy on them, God!'\r\n  Why, who art Thou to teach, and He to learn?\"\r\n\r\nThe Bodleian Quatrain pleads Pantheism by way of Justification.\r\n\r\n \"If I myself upon a looser Creed\r\n  Have loosely strung the Jewel of Good deed,\r\n  Let this one thing for my Atonement plead:\r\n  That One for Two I never did misread.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reviewer,[6] to whom I owe the Particulars of Omar's Life,\r\nconcludes his Review by comparing him with Lucretius, both as to\r\nnatural Temper and Genius, and as acted upon by the Circumstances in\r\nwhich he lived.  Both indeed were men of subtle, strong, and\r\ncultivated Intellect, fine Imagination, and Hearts passionate for\r\nTruth and Justice; who justly revolted from their Country's false\r\nReligion, and false, or foolish, Devotion to it; but who fell short of\r\nreplacing what they subverted by such better Hope as others, with no\r\nbetter Revelation to guide them, had yet made a Law to themselves.\r\nLucretius indeed, with such material as Epicurus furnished, satisfied\r\nhimself with the theory of a vast machine fortuitously constructed,\r\nand acting by a Law that implied no Legislator; and so composing\r\nhimself into a Stoical rather than Epicurean severity of Attitude, sat\r\ndown to contemplate the mechanical drama of the Universe which he was\r\npart Actor in; himself and all about him (as in his own sublime\r\ndescription of the Roman Theater) discolored with the lurid reflex of\r\nthe Curtain suspended between the Spectator and the Sun.  Omar, more\r\ndesperate, or more careless of any so complicated System as resulted\r\nin nothing but hopeless Necessity, flung his own Genius and Learning\r\nwith a bitter or humorous jest into the general Ruin which their\r\ninsufficient glimpses only served to reveal; and, pretending sensual\r\npleasure, as the serious purpose of Life, only diverted himself with\r\nspeculative problems of Deity, Destiny, Matter and Spirit, Good and\r\nEvil, and other such questions, easier to start than to run down, and\r\nthe pursuit of which becomes a very weary sport at last!\r\n\r\nWith regard to the present Translation.  The original Rubaiyat (as,\r\nmissing an Arabic Guttural, these Tetrastichs are more musically\r\ncalled) are independent Stanzas, consisting each of four Lines of\r\nequal, though varied, Prosody; sometimes all rhyming, but oftener (as\r\nhere imitated) the third line a blank.  Somewhat as in the Greek\r\nAlcaic, where the penultimate line seems to lift and suspend the Wave\r\nthat falls over in the last.  As usual with such kind of Oriental\r\nVerse, the Rubaiyat follow one another according to Alphabetic\r\nRhyme--a strange succession of Grave and Gay.  Those here selected are\r\nstrung into something of an Eclogue, with perhaps a less than equal\r\nproportion of the \"Drink and make-merry,\" which (genuine or not)\r\nrecurs over-frequently in the Original.  Either way, the Result is sad\r\nenough: saddest perhaps when most ostentatiously merry: more apt to\r\nmove Sorrow than Anger toward the old Tentmaker, who, after vainly\r\nendeavoring to unshackle his Steps from Destiny, and to catch some\r\nauthentic Glimpse of TO-MORROW, fell back upon TO-DAY (which has\r\noutlasted so many To-morrows!) as the only Ground he had got to stand\r\nupon, however momentarily slipping from under his Feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Third Edition.]\r\n\r\nWhile the second Edition of this version of Omar was preparing,\r\nMonsieur Nicolas, French Consul at Resht, published a very careful and\r\nvery good Edition of the Text, from a lithograph copy at Teheran,\r\ncomprising 464 Rubaiyat, with translation and notes of his own.\r\n\r\nMons. Nicolas, whose Edition has reminded me of several things, and\r\ninstructed me in others, does not consider Omar to be the material\r\nEpicurean that I have literally taken him for, but a Mystic, shadowing\r\nthe Deity under the figure of Wine, Wine-bearer, &c., as Hafiz is\r\nsupposed to do; in short, a Sufi Poet like Hafiz and the rest.\r\n\r\nI cannot see reason to alter my opinion, formed as it was more than a\r\ndozen years ago when Omar was first shown me by one to whom I am\r\nindebted for all I know of Oriental, and very much of other,\r\nliterature.  He admired Omar's Genius so much, that he would gladly\r\nhave adopted any such Interpretation of his meaning as Mons. Nicolas'\r\nif he could.[7]  That he could not, appears by his Paper in the\r\nCalcutta Review already so largely quoted; in which he argues from the\r\nPoems themselves, as well as from what records remain of the Poet's\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nAnd if more were needed to disprove Mons. Nicolas' Theory, there is\r\nthe Biographical Notice which he himself has drawn up in direct\r\ncontradiction to the Interpretation of the Poems given in his Notes.\r\n(See pp. 13-14 of his Preface.)  Indeed I hardly knew poor Omar was so\r\nfar gone till his Apologist informed me.  For here we see that,\r\nwhatever were the Wine that Hafiz drank and sang, the veritable Juice\r\nof the Grape it was which Omar used, not only when carousing with his\r\nfriends, but (says Mons. Nicolas) in order to excite himself to that\r\npitch of Devotion which others reached by cries and \"hurlemens.\"  And\r\nyet, whenever Wine, Wine-bearer, &c., occur in the Text--which is\r\noften enough--Mons. Nicolas carefully annotates \"Dieu,\" \"La Divinite,\"\r\n&c.: so carefully indeed that one is tempted to think that he was\r\nindoctrinated by the Sufi with whom he read the Poems.  (Note to Rub.\r\nii. p. 8.)  A Persian would naturally wish to vindicate a\r\ndistinguished Countryman; and a Sufi to enroll him in his own sect,\r\nwhich already comprises all the chief Poets of Persia.\r\n\r\nWhat historical Authority has Mons. Nicolas to show that Omar gave\r\nhimself up \"avec passion a l'etude de la philosophie des Soufis\"?\r\n(Preface, p. xiii.)  The Doctrines of Pantheism, Materialism,\r\nNecessity, &c., were not peculiar to the Sufi; nor to Lucretius before\r\nthem; nor to Epicurus before him; probably the very original\r\nIrreligion of Thinking men from the first; and very likely to be the\r\nspontaneous growth of a Philosopher living in an Age of social and\r\npolitical barbarism, under shadow of one of the Two and Seventy\r\nReligions supposed to divide the world.  Von Hammer (according to\r\nSprenger's Oriental Catalogue) speaks of Omar as \"a Free-thinker, and\r\na great opponent of Sufism;\" perhaps because, while holding much of\r\ntheir Doctrine, he would not pretend to any inconsistent severity of\r\nmorals.  Sir W. Ouseley has written a note to something of the same\r\neffect on the fly-leaf of the Bodleian MS.  And in two Rubaiyat of\r\nMons. Nicolas' own Edition Suf and Sufi are both disparagingly named.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many of these Quatrains seem unaccountable unless mystically\r\ninterpreted; but many more as unaccountable unless literally.  Were\r\nthe Wine spiritual, for instance, how wash the Body with it when dead?\r\nWhy make cups of the dead clay to be filled with--\"La Divinite,\" by\r\nsome succeeding Mystic?  Mons. Nicolas himself is puzzled by some\r\n\"bizarres\" and \"trop Orientales\" allusions and images--\"d'une\r\nsensualite quelquefois revoltante\" indeed--which \"les convenances\" do\r\nnot permit him to translate; but still which the reader cannot but\r\nrefer to \"La Divinite.\"[8]  No doubt also many of the Quatrains in the\r\nTeheran, as in the Calcutta, Copies, are spurious; such Rubaiyat being\r\nthe common form of Epigram in Persia.  But this, at best, tells as\r\nmuch one way as another; nay, the Sufi, who may be considered the\r\nScholar and Man of Letters in Persia, would be far more likely than\r\nthe careless Epicure to interpolate what favours his own view of the\r\nPoet.  I observed that very few of the more mystical Quatrains are in\r\nthe Bodleian MS., which must be one of the oldest, as dated at Shiraz,\r\nA.H. 865, A.D. 1460.  And this, I think, especially distinguishes Omar\r\n(I cannot help calling him by his--no, not Christian--familiar name)\r\nfrom all other Persian Poets: That, whereas with them the Poet is lost\r\nin his Song, the Man in Allegory and Abstraction; we seem to have the\r\nMan--the Bon-homme--Omar himself, with all his Humours and Passions,\r\nas frankly before us as if we were really at Table with him, after the\r\nWine had gone round.\r\n\r\nI must say that I, for one, never wholly believed in the Mysticism of\r\nHafiz.  It does not appear there was any danger in holding and singing\r\nSufi Pantheism, so long as the Poet made his Salaam to Mohammed at the\r\nbeginning and end of his Song.  Under such conditions Jelaluddin,\r\nJami, Attar, and others sang; using Wine and Beauty indeed as Images\r\nto illustrate, not as a Mask to hide, the Divinity they were\r\ncelebrating.  Perhaps some Allegory less liable to mistake or abuse\r\nhad been better among so inflammable a People: much more so when, as\r\nsome think with Hafiz and Omar, the abstract is not only likened to,\r\nbut identified with, the sensual Image; hazardous, if not to the\r\nDevotee himself, yet to his weaker Brethren; and worse for the Profane\r\nin proportion as the Devotion of the Initiated grew warmer.  And all\r\nfor what?  To be tantalized with Images of sensual enjoyment which\r\nmust be renounced if one would approximate a God, who according to the\r\nDoctrine, is Sensual Matter as well as Spirit, and into whose Universe\r\none expects unconsciously to merge after Death, without hope of any\r\nposthumous Beatitude in another world to compensate for all one's self-\r\ndenial in this.  Lucretius' blind Divinity certainly merited, and\r\nprobably got, as much self-sacrifice as this of the Sufi; and the\r\nburden of Omar's Song--if not \"Let us eat\"--is assuredly--\"Let us\r\ndrink, for To-morrow we die!\"  And if Hafiz meant quite otherwise by a\r\nsimilar language, he surely miscalculated when he devoted his Life and\r\nGenius to so equivocal a Psalmody as, from his Day to this, has been\r\nsaid and sung by any rather than spiritual Worshippers.\r\n\r\nHowever, as there is some traditional presumption, and certainly the\r\nopinion of some learned men, in favour of Omar's being a Sufi--and\r\neven something of a Saint--those who please may so interpret his Wine\r\nand Cup-bearer.  On the other hand, as there is far more historical\r\ncertainty of his being a Philosopher, of scientific Insight and\r\nAbility far beyond that of the Age and Country he lived in; of such\r\nmoderate worldly Ambition as becomes a Philosopher, and such moderate\r\nwants as rarely satisfy a Debauchee; other readers may be content to\r\nbelieve with me that, while the Wine Omar celebrates is simply the\r\nJuice of the Grape, he bragg'd more than he drank of it, in very\r\ndefiance perhaps of that Spiritual Wine which left its Votaries sunk\r\nin Hypocrisy or Disgust.\r\n\r\nEdward J.

Flinging a Stone into the Cup was the signal for \"To\r\nHorse!\" in the Desert.\r\n\r\n(II.) The \"False Dawn\"; Subhi Kazib, a transient Light on the Horizon\r\nabout an hour before the Subhi sadik or True Dawn; a well-known\r\nPhenomenon in the East.\r\n\r\n(IV.) New Year.  Beginning with the Vernal Equinox, it must be\r\nremembered; and (howsoever the old Solar Year is practically\r\nsuperseded by the clumsy Lunar Year that dates from the Mohammedan\r\nHijra) still commemorated by a Festival that is said to have been\r\nappointed by the very Jamshyd whom Omar so often talks of, and whose\r\nyearly Calendar he helped to rectify.\r\n\r\n\"The sudden approach and rapid advance of the Spring,\" says Mr.\r\nBinning, \"are very striking.  Before the Snow is well off the Ground,\r\nthe Trees burst into Blossom, and the Flowers start from the Soil.  At\r\nNaw Rooz (their New Year's Day) the Snow was lying in patches on the\r\nHills and in the shaded Vallies, while the Fruit-trees in the Garden\r\nwere budding beautifully, and green Plants and Flowers springing upon\r\nthe Plains on every side--\r\n\r\n  'And on old Hyems' Chin and icy Crown\r\n   An odorous Chaplet of sweet Summer buds\r\n   Is, as in mockery, set--'--\r\n\r\nAmong the Plants newly appear'd I recognized some Acquaintances I had\r\nnot seen for many a Year: among these, two varieties of the Thistle; a\r\ncoarse species of the Daisy, like the Horse-gowan; red and white\r\nclover; the Dock; the blue Cornflower; and that vulgar Herb the\r\nDandelion rearing its yellow crest on the Banks of the Water-courses.\"\r\nThe Nightingale was not yet heard, for the Rose was not yet blown: but\r\nan almost identical Blackbird and Woodpecker helped to make up\r\nsomething of a North-country Spring.\r\n\r\n\"The White Hand of Moses.\"  Exodus iv. 6; where Moses draws forth his\r\nHand--not, according to the Persians, \"leprous as Snow,\" but white, as\r\nour May-blossom in Spring perhaps.  According to them also the Healing\r\nPower of Jesus resided in his Breath.\r\n\r\n(V.) Iram, planted by King Shaddad, and now sunk somewhere in the\r\nSands of Arabia.  Jamshyd's Seven-ring'd Cup was typical of the 7\r\nHeavens, 7 Planets, 7 Seas, &c., and was a Divining Cup.\r\n\r\n(VI.) Pehlevi, the old Heroic Sanskrit of Persia.  Hafiz also speaks\r\nof the Nightingale's Pehlevi, which did not change with the People's.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the fourth line refers to the Red Rose looking\r\nsickly, or to the Yellow Rose that ought to be Red; Red, White, and\r\nYellow Roses all common in Persia.  I think that Southey in his Common-\r\nPlace Book, quotes from some Spanish author about the Rose being White\r\ntill 10 o'clock; \"Rosa Perfecta\" at 2; and \"perfecta incarnada\" at 5.\r\n\r\n(X.) Rustum, the \"Hercules\" of Persia, and Zal his Father, whose\r\nexploits are among the most celebrated in the Shahnama.  Hatim Tai, a\r\nwell-known type of Oriental Generosity.\r\n\r\n(XIII.) A Drum--beaten outside a Palace.\r\n\r\n(XIV.) That is, the Rose's Golden Centre.\r\n\r\n(XVIII.) Persepolis: call'd also Takht-i-Jam-shyd--THE THRONE OF\r\nJAMSHYD, \"King Splendid,\" of the mythical Peshdadian Dynasty, and\r\nsupposed (according to the Shah-nama) to have been founded and built\r\nby him.  Others refer it to the Work of the Genie King, Jan Ibn\r\nJan--who also built the Pyramids--before the time of Adam.\r\n\r\nBAHRAM GUR.--Bahram of the Wild Ass--a Sassanian Sovereign--had also\r\nhis Seven Castles (like the King of Bohemia!) each of a different\r\nColour: each with a Royal Mistress within; each of whom tells him a\r\nStory, as told in one of the most famous Poems of Persia, written by\r\nAmir Khusraw: all these Sevens also figuring (according to Eastern\r\nMysticism) the Seven Heavens; and perhaps the Book itself that Eighth,\r\ninto which the mystical Seven transcend, and within which they\r\nrevolve.  The Ruins of Three of those Towers are yet shown by the\r\nPeasantry; as also the Swamp in which Bahram sunk, like the Master of\r\nRavenswood, while pursuing his Gur.\r\n\r\n  The Palace that to Heav'n his pillars threw,\r\n  And Kings the forehead on his threshold drew--\r\n     I saw the solitary Ringdove there,\r\n  And \"Coo, coo, coo,\" she cried; and \"Coo, coo, coo.\"\r\n\r\n[Included in Nicolas's edition as No. 350 of the Rubaiyat, and also in\r\nMr. Whinfield's translation.]\r\n\r\nThis Quatrain Mr. Binning found, among several of Hafiz and others,\r\ninscribed by some stray hand among the ruins of Persepolis.  The\r\nRingdove's ancient Pehlevi Coo, Coo, Coo, signifies also in Persian\r\n\"Where? Where?  Where?\"  In Attar's \"Bird-parliament\" she is reproved\r\nby the Leader of the Birds for sitting still, and for ever harping on\r\nthat one note of lamentation for her lost Yusuf.\r\n\r\nApropos of Omar's Red Roses in Stanza xix, I am reminded of an old\r\nEnglish Superstition, that our Anemone Pulsatilla, or purple \"Pasque\r\nFlower,\" (which grows plentifully about the Fleam Dyke, near\r\nCambridge,) grows only where Danish Blood has been spilt.\r\n\r\n(XXI.) A thousand years to each Planet.\r\n\r\n(XXXI.) Saturn, Lord of the Seventh Heaven.\r\n\r\n(XXXII.) ME-AND-THEE: some dividual Existence or Personality distinct\r\nfrom the Whole.\r\n\r\n(XXXVII.) One of the Persian Poets--Attar, I think--has a pretty story\r\nabout this.  A thirsty Traveller dips his hand into a Spring of Water\r\nto drink from.  By-and-by comes another who draws up and drinks from\r\nan earthen bowl, and then departs, leaving his Bowl behind him.  The\r\nfirst Traveller takes it up for another draught; but is surprised to\r\nfind that the same Water which had tasted sweet from his own hand\r\ntastes bitter from the earthen Bowl.  But a Voice--from Heaven, I\r\nthink--tells him the clay from which the Bowl is made was once Man;\r\nand, into whatever shape renew'd, can never lose the bitter flavour of\r\nMortality.\r\n\r\n(XXXIX.) The custom of throwing a little Wine on the ground before\r\ndrinking still continues in Persia, and perhaps generally in the East.\r\nMons. Nicolas considers it \"un signe de liberalite, et en meme temps\r\nun avertissement que le buveur doit vider sa coupe jusqu'a la derniere\r\ngoutte.\"  Is it not more likely an ancient Superstition; a Libation to\r\npropitiate Earth, or make her an Accomplice in the illicit Revel?  Or,\r\nperhaps, to divert the Jealous Eye by some sacrifice of superfluity,\r\nas with the Ancients of the West?  With Omar we see something more is\r\nsignified; the precious Liquor is not lost, but sinks into the ground\r\nto refresh the dust of some poor Wine-worshipper foregone.\r\n\r\nThus Hafiz, copying Omar in so many ways: \"When thou drinkest Wine\r\npour a draught on the ground.  Wherefore fear the Sin which brings to\r\nanother Gain?\"\r\n\r\n(XLIII.) According to one beautiful Oriental Legend, Azrael\r\naccomplishes his mission by holding to the nostril an Apple from the\r\nTree of Life.\r\n\r\nThis, and the two following Stanzas would have been withdrawn, as\r\nsomewhat de trop, from the Text, but for advice which I least like to\r\ndisregard.\r\n\r\n(LI.) From Mah to Mahi; from Fish to Moon.\r\n\r\n(LVI.) A Jest, of course, at his Studies.  A curious mathematical\r\nQuatrain of Omar's has been pointed out to me; the more curious\r\nbecause almost exactly parallel'd by some Verses of Doctor Donne's,\r\nthat are quoted in Izaak Walton's Lives!  Here is Omar: \"You and I are\r\nthe image of a pair of compasses; though we have two heads (sc. our\r\nfeet) we have one body; when we have fixed the centre for our circle,\r\nwe bring our heads (sc. feet) together at the end.\"  Dr. Donne:\r\n\r\n  If we be two, we two are so\r\n     As stiff twin-compasses are two;\r\n  Thy Soul, the fixt foot, makes no show\r\n     To move, but does if the other do.\r\n\r\n  And though thine in the centre sit,\r\n     Yet when my other far does roam,\r\n  Thine leans and hearkens after it,\r\n     And rows erect as mine comes home.\r\n\r\n  Such thou must be to me, who must\r\n     Like the other foot obliquely run;\r\n  Thy firmness makes my circle just,\r\n     And me to end where I begun.\r\n\r\n(LIX.) The Seventy-two Religions supposed to divide the World,\r\nincluding Islamism, as some think: but others not.\r\n\r\n(LX.) Alluding to Sultan Mahmud's Conquest of India and its dark\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n(LXVIII.) Fanusi khiyal, a Magic-lanthorn still used in India; the\r\ncylindrical Interior being painted with various Figures, and so\r\nlightly poised and ventilated as to revolve round the lighted Candle\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n(LXX.) A very mysterious Line in the Original:\r\n\r\n   O danad O danad O danad O--\r\n\r\nbreaking off something like our Wood-pigeon's Note, which she is said\r\nto take up just where she left off.\r\n\r\n(LXXV.) Parwin and Mushtari--The Pleiads and Jupiter.\r\n\r\n(LXXXVII.) This Relation of Pot and Potter to Man and his Maker\r\nfigures far and wide in the Literature of the World, from the time of\r\nthe Hebrew Prophets to the present; when it may finally take the name\r\nof \"Pot theism,\" by which Mr. Carlyle ridiculed Sterling's\r\n\"Pantheism.\"  My Sheikh, whose knowledge flows in from all quarters,\r\nwrites to me--\r\n\r\n\"Apropos of old Omar's Pots, did I ever tell you the sentence I found\r\nin 'Bishop Pearson on the Creed'?  'Thus are we wholly at the disposal\r\nof His will, and our present and future condition framed and ordered\r\nby His free, but wise and just, decrees.  Hath not the potter power\r\nover the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and\r\nanother unto dishonour?  (Rom. ix. 21.)  And can that earth-artificer\r\nhave a freer power over his brother potsherd (both being made of the\r\nsame metal), than God hath over him, who, by the strange fecundity of\r\nHis omnipotent power, first made the clay out of nothing, and then him\r\nout of that?'\"\r\n\r\nAnd again--from a very different quarter--\"I had to refer the other\r\nday to Aristophanes, and came by chance on a curious Speaking-pot\r\nstory in the Vespae, which I had quite forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Greek text deleted from etext.]\r\n\r\n\"The Pot calls a bystander to be a witness to his bad treatment.  The\r\nwoman says, 'If, by Proserpine, instead of all this 'testifying'\r\n(comp. Cuddie and his mother in 'Old Mortality!') you would buy\r\nyourself a rivet, it would show more sense in you!'  The Scholiast\r\nexplains echinus as [Greek phrase deleted from etext].\"\r\n\r\nOne more illustration for the oddity's sake from the \"Autobiography of\r\na Cornish Rector,\" by the late James Hamley Tregenna.  1871.\r\n\r\n\"There was one odd Fellow in our Company--he was so like a Figure in\r\nthe 'Pilgrim's Progress' that Richard always called him the\r\n'ALLEGORY,' with a long white beard--a rare Appendage in those\r\ndays--and a Face the colour of which seemed to have been baked in,\r\nlike the Faces one used to see on Earthenware Jugs.  In our Country-\r\ndialect Earthenware is called 'Clome'; so the Boys of the Village used\r\nto shout out after him--'Go back to the Potter, Old Clomeface, and get\r\nbaked over again.'  For the 'Allegory,' though shrewd enough in most\r\nthings, had the reputation of being 'saift-baked,' i.e., of weak\r\nintellect.\"\r\n\r\n(XC.) At the Close of the Fasting Month, Ramazan (which makes the\r\nMussulman unhealthy and unamiable), the first Glimpse of the New Moon\r\n(who rules their division of the Year) is looked for with the utmost\r\nAnxiety, and hailed with Acclamation.  Then it is that the Porter's\r\nKnot maybe heard--toward the Cellar.  Omar has elsewhere a pretty\r\nQuatrain about the same Moon--\r\n\r\n \"Be of Good Cheer--the sullen Month will die,\r\n  And a young Moon requite us by and by:\r\n    Look how the Old one meagre, bent, and wan\r\n  With Age and Fast, is fainting from the Sky!\"",
