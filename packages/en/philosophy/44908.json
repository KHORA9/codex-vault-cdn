U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn offering to the public a second edition of _The Law of Civilization\r\nand Decay_ I take the opportunity to say emphatically that such value\r\nas the essay may have lies in its freedom from any preconceived bias.\r\nAll theories contained in the book, whether religious or economic, are\r\nthe effect, and not the cause, of the way in which the facts unfolded\r\nthemselves. I have been passive.\r\n\r\nThe value of history lies not in the multitude of facts collected, but\r\nin their relation to each other, and in this respect an author can have\r\nno larger responsibility than any other scientific observer. If the\r\nsequence of events seems to indicate the existence of a law governing\r\nsocial development, such a law may be suggested, but to approve or\r\ndisapprove of it would be as futile as to discuss the moral bearings of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when writing a sketch of the history of the colony of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, I became deeply interested in certain religious\r\naspects of the Reformation, which seemed hardly reconcilable with\r\nthe theories usually advanced to explain them. After the book had\r\nbeen published, I continued reading theology, and, step by step,\r\nwas led back, through the schoolmen and the crusades, to the revival\r\nof the pilgrimage to Palestine, which followed upon the conversion\r\nof the Huns. As ferocious pagans, the Huns had long closed the road\r\nto Constantinople; but the change which swept over Europe after the\r\nyear 1000, when Saint Stephen was crowned, was unmistakable; the West\r\nreceived an impulsion from the East. I thus became convinced that\r\nreligious enthusiasm, which, by stimulating the pilgrimage, restored\r\ncommunication between the Bosphorus and the Rhine, was the power which\r\nproduced the accelerated movement culminating in modern centralization.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I thought I had discovered not only that faith, during\r\nthe eleventh, twelfth, and early thirteenth centuries, spoke by\r\npreference through architecture, but also that in France and Syria,\r\nat least, a precise relation existed between the ecclesiastical and\r\nmilitary systems of building, and that the one could not be understood\r\nwithout the other. In the commercial cities of the same epoch, on\r\nthe contrary, the religious idea assumed no definite form of artistic\r\nexpression, for the Gothic never flourished in Venice, Genoa, Pisa,\r\nor Florence, nor did any pure school of architecture thrive in the\r\nmercantile atmosphere. Furthermore, commerce from the outset seemed\r\nantagonistic to the imagination, for a universal decay of architecture\r\nset in throughout Europe after the great commercial expansion of the\r\nthirteenth century; and the inference I drew from these facts was,\r\nthat the economic instinct must have chosen some other medium by\r\nwhich to express itself. My observations led me to suppose that the\r\ncoinage might be such a medium, and I ultimately concluded that, if the\r\ndevelopment of a mercantile community is to be understood, it must be\r\napproached through its money.\r\n\r\nAnother conviction forced upon my mind, by the examination of long\r\nperiods of history, was the exceedingly small part played by conscious\r\nthought in moulding the fate of men. At the moment of action the human\r\nbeing almost invariably obeys an instinct, like an animal; only after\r\naction has ceased does he reflect.\r\n\r\nThese controlling instincts are involuntary, and divide men into\r\nspecies distinct enough to cause opposite effects under identical\r\nconditions. For instance, impelled by fear, one type will rush upon an\r\nenemy, and another will run away; while the love of women or of money\r\nhas stamped certain races as sharply as ferocity or cunning has stamped\r\nthe lion or the fox.\r\n\r\nLike other personal characteristics, the peculiarities of the mind\r\nare apparently strongly hereditary, and, if these instincts be\r\ntransmitted from generation to generation, it is plain that, as the\r\nexternal world changes, those who receive this heritage must rise or\r\nfall in the social scale, according as their nervous system is well\r\nor ill adapted to the conditions to which they are born. Nothing is\r\ncommoner, for example, than to find families who have been famous\r\nin one century sinking into obscurity in the next, not because the\r\nchildren have degenerated, but because a certain field of activity\r\nwhich afforded the ancestor full scope, has been closed against his\r\noffspring. Particularly has this been true in revolutionary epochs such\r\nas the Reformation; and families so situated have very generally become\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nWhen this stage had been reached, the Reformation began to wear a new\r\naspect, but several years elapsed before I saw whither my studies led.\r\nOnly very slowly did a sequence of cause and effect take shape in my\r\nmind, a sequence wholly unexpected in character, whose growth resembled\r\nthe arrangement of the fragments of an inscription, which cannot be\r\nread until the stones have been set in a determined order. Finally, as\r\nthe historical work neared an end, I perceived that the intellectual\r\nphenomena under examination fell into a series which seemed to\r\ncorrespond, somewhat closely, with the laws which are supposed to\r\nregulate the movements of the material universe.\r\n\r\nTheories can be tested only by applying them to facts, and the facts\r\nrelating to successive phases of human thought, whether conscious or\r\nunconscious, constitute history; therefore, if intellectual phenomena\r\nare evolved in a regular sequence, history, like matter, must be\r\ngoverned by law. In support of such a conjecture, I venture to offer\r\nan hypothesis by which to classify a few of the more interesting\r\nintellectual phases through which human society must, apparently,\r\npass, in its oscillations between barbarism and civilization, or, what\r\namounts to the same thing, in its movement from a condition of physical\r\ndispersion to one of concentration. The accompanying volume contains\r\nthe evidence which suggested the hypothesis, although, it seems hardly\r\nnecessary to add, an essay of this size on so vast a subject can only\r\nbe regarded as a suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe theory proposed is based upon the accepted scientific principle\r\nthat the law of force and energy is of universal application in nature,\r\nand that animal life is one of the outlets through which solar energy\r\nis dissipated.\r\n\r\nStarting from this fundamental proposition, the first deduction is,\r\nthat, as human societies are forms of animal life, these societies must\r\ndiffer among themselves in energy, in proportion as nature has endowed\r\nthem, more or less abundantly, with energetic material.\r\n\r\nThought is one of the manifestations of human energy, and among the\r\nearlier and simpler phases of thought, two stand conspicuous--Fear and\r\nGreed. Fear, which, by stimulating the imagination, creates a belief\r\nin an invisible world, and ultimately develops a priesthood; and Greed,\r\nwhich dissipates energy in war and trade.\r\n\r\nProbably the velocity of the social movement of any community\r\nis proportionate to its energy and mass, and its centralization\r\nis proportionate to its velocity; therefore, as human movement\r\nis accelerated, societies centralize. In the earlier stages of\r\nconcentration, fear appears to be the channel through which energy\r\nfinds the readiest outlet; accordingly, in primitive and scattered\r\ncommunities, the imagination is vivid, and the mental types produced\r\nare religious, military, artistic. As consolidation advances, fear\r\nyields to greed, and the economic organism tends to supersede the\r\nemotional and martial.\r\n\r\nWhenever a race is so richly endowed with the energetic material that\r\nit does not expend all its energy in the daily struggle for life,\r\nthe surplus may be stored in the shape of wealth; and this stock of\r\nstored energy may be transferred from community to community, either by\r\nconquest, or by superiority in economic competition.\r\n\r\nHowever large may be the store of energy accumulated by conquest, a\r\nrace must, sooner or later, reach the limit of its martial energy,\r\nwhen it must enter on the phase of economic competition. But, as the\r\neconomic organism radically differs from the emotional and martial,\r\nthe effect of economic competition has been, perhaps invariably, to\r\ndissipate the energy amassed by war.\r\n\r\nWhen surplus energy has accumulated in such bulk as to preponderate\r\nover productive energy, it becomes the controlling social force.\r\nThenceforward, capital is autocratic, and energy vents itself through\r\nthose organisms best fitted to give expression to the power of capital.\r\nIn this last stage of consolidation, the economic, and, perhaps, the\r\nscientific intellect is propagated, while the imagination fades,\r\nand the emotional, the martial, and the artistic types of manhood\r\ndecay. When a social velocity has been attained at which the waste of\r\nenergetic material is so great that the martial and imaginative stocks\r\nfail to reproduce themselves, intensifying competition appears to\r\ngenerate two extreme economic types,--the usurer in his most formidable\r\naspect, and the peasant whose nervous system is best adapted to thrive\r\non scanty nutriment. At length a point must be reached when pressure\r\ncan go no further, and then, perhaps, one of two results may follow: A\r\nstationary period may supervene, which may last until ended by war, by\r\nexhaustion, or by both combined, as seems to have been the case with\r\nthe Eastern Empire; or, as in the Western, disintegration may set in,\r\nthe civilized population may perish, and a reversion may take place to\r\na primitive form of organism.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, however, seems to point to the conclusion that, when\r\na highly centralized society disintegrates, under the pressure of\r\neconomic competition, it is because the energy of the race has been\r\nexhausted. Consequently, the survivors of such a community lack the\r\npower necessary for renewed concentration, and must probably remain\r\ninert until supplied with fresh energetic material by the infusion of\r\nbarbarian blood.\r\n\r\n                                                 BROOKS ADAMS.\r\n\r\n  Quincy, August 20, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  The Romans                                          1\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  The Middle Age                                     48\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  The First Crusade                                  79\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  The Second Crusade                                103\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  The Fall of Constantinople                        124\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  The Suppression of the Temple                     152\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  The English Reformation                           186\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  The Suppression of the Convents                   220\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n  The Eviction of the Yeomen                        243\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  Spain and India                                   286\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n  Modern Centralization                             313\r\n\r\n                      CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n  Conclusion                                        352\r\n\r\n  Index                                             385\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVILIZATION AND DECAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans first emerged from the mist of fable, they were already\r\na race of land-owners who held their property in severalty, and, as the\r\nright of alienation was established, the formation of relatively large\r\nestates had begun. The ordinary family, however, held, perhaps, twelve\r\nacres, and, as the land was arable, and the staple grain, it supported\r\na dense rural population. The husbandmen who tilled this land were\r\nof the martial type, and, probably for that reason, though supremely\r\ngifted as administrators and soldiers, were ill-fitted to endure\r\nthe strain of the unrestricted economic competition of a centralized\r\nsociety. Consequently their conquests had hardly consolidated before\r\ndecay set in, a decay whose causes may be traced back until they are\r\nlost in the dawn of history.\r\n\r\nThe Latins had little economic versatility; they lacked the instinct\r\nof the Greeks for commerce, or of the Syrians and Hindoos for\r\nmanufactures. They were essentially land-owners, and, when endowed with\r\nthe acquisitive faculty, usurers. The latter early developed into a\r\ndistinct species, at once more subtle of intellect and more tenacious\r\nof life than the farmers, and on the disparity between these two types\r\nof men, the fate of all subsequent civilization has hinged. At a remote\r\nantiquity Roman society divided into creditors and debtors; as it\r\nconsolidated, the power of the former increased, thus intensifying the\r\npressure on the weak, until, when centralization culminated under the\r\nCæsars, reproduction slackened, disintegration set in, and, after some\r\ncenturies of decline, the Middle Ages began.\r\n\r\nThe history of the monarchy must probably always remain a matter of\r\nconjecture, but it seems reasonably certain that the expulsion of\r\nthe Tarquins was the victory of an hereditary monied caste, which\r\nsucceeded in concentrating the functions of government in a practically\r\nself-perpetuating body drawn from their own order.[1] Niebuhr has\r\ndemonstrated, in one of his most striking chapters, that usury was\r\noriginally a patrician privilege; and some of the fiercest struggles\r\nof the early republic seem to have been decided against the oligarchy\r\nby wealthy plebeians, who were determined to break down the monopoly\r\nin money-lending. At all events, the conditions of life evidently\r\nfavoured the growth of the instinct which causes its possessor to suck\r\nthe vitality of the economically weak; and Macaulay, in the preface to\r\n_Virginia_, has given so vivid a picture of the dominant class, that\r\none passage at least should be read entire.\r\n\r\n   “The ruling class in Rome was a monied class; and it made and\r\n    administered the laws with a view solely to its own interest.\r\n    Thus the relation between lender and borrower was mixed up\r\n    with the relation between sovereign and subject. The great\r\n    men held a large portion of the community in dependence by\r\n    means of advances at enormous usury. The law of debt, framed\r\n    by creditors, and for the protection of creditors, was the\r\n    most horrible that has ever been known among men. The liberty,\r\n    and even the life, of the insolvent were at the mercy of\r\n    the patrician money-lenders. Children often became slaves in\r\n    consequence of the misfortunes of their parents. The debtor was\r\n    imprisoned, not in a public gaol under the care of impartial\r\n    public functionaries, but in a private workhouse belonging\r\n    to the creditor. Frightful stories were told respecting these\r\n    dungeons.”\r\n\r\nBut a prisoner is an expense, and the patricians wanted money. Their\r\nproblem was to exhaust the productive power of the debtor before\r\nselling him, and, as slaves have less energy than freemen, a system was\r\ndevised by which the plebeians were left on their land, and stimulated\r\nto labour by the hope of redeeming themselves and their children from\r\nservitude. Niebuhr has explained at length how this was done.\r\n\r\nFor money weighed out a person could pledge himself, his family, and\r\nall that belonged to him. In this condition he became _nexus_, and\r\nremained in possession of his property until breach of condition,\r\nwhen the creditor could proceed by summary process.[2] Such a contract\r\nsatisfied the requirements, and the usurers had then only to invent a\r\njudgment for debt severe enough to force the debtor to become _nexus_\r\nwhen the alternative was offered him. This presented no difficulty.\r\nWhen an action was begun the defendant had thirty days of grace, and\r\nwas then arrested and brought before the prætor. If he could neither\r\npay nor find security, he was fettered with irons weighing not less\r\nthan fifteen pounds, and taken home by the plaintiff. There he was\r\nallowed a pound of corn a day, and given sixty days in which to settle.\r\nIf he failed, he was taken again before the prætor and sentenced.\r\nUnder this sentence he might be sold or executed, and, where there\r\nwere several plaintiffs, they might cut him up among them, nor was\r\nany individual liable for carving more than his share.[3] A man so\r\nsentenced involved his descendants, and therefore, rather than submit,\r\nthe whole debtor class became _nexi_, toiling for ever to fulfil\r\ncontracts quite beyond their strength, and year by year sinking more\r\nhopelessly into debt, for ordinarily the accumulated interest soon\r\nraised “the principal to many times its original amount.”[4] Niebuhr\r\nhas thus summed up the economic situation:--\r\n\r\n   “To understand the condition of the plebeian debtors, let the\r\n    reader, if he is a man of business, imagine that the whole of\r\n    the private debts in a given country were turned into bills\r\n    at a year, bearing interest at twenty per cent or more; and\r\n    that the non-payment of them were followed on summary process\r\n    by imprisonment, and by the transfer of the debtor’s whole\r\n    property to his creditor, even though it exceeded what he\r\n    owed. We do not need those further circumstances, which are\r\n    incompatible with our manners, the personal slavery of the\r\n    debtor and of his children, to form an estimate of the fearful\r\n    condition of the unfortunate plebeians.”[5]\r\n\r\nThus the usurer first exhausted a family and then sold it; and as his\r\nclass fed on insolvency and controlled legislation, the laws were as\r\ningeniously contrived for creating debt, as for making it profitable\r\nwhen contracted. One characteristic device was the power given the\r\nmagistrate of fining for “offences against order.” Under this head “men\r\nmight include any accusations they pleased, and by the higher grades\r\nin the scale of fines they might accomplish whatever they desired.”[6]\r\nAs the capitalists owned the courts and administered justice, they had\r\nthe means at hand of ruining any plebeian whose property was tempting.\r\nNevertheless, the stronghold of usury lay in the fiscal system, which\r\ndown to the fall of the Empire was an engine for working bankruptcy.\r\nRome’s policy was to farm the taxes; that is to say, after assessment,\r\nto sell them to a publican, who collected what he could. The business\r\nwas profitable in proportion as it was extortionate, and the country\r\nwas subjected to a levy unregulated by law, and conducted to enrich\r\nspeculators. “Ubi publicanus est,” said Livy, quoting the Senate, “ibi\r\naut jus publicum vanum, aut libertatem sociis nullam esse.”[7]\r\n\r\nUsury was the cream of this business. The custom was to lend to\r\ndefaulters at such high rates of interest that insolvency was nearly\r\ncertain to follow; then the people were taken on execution, and\r\nslave-hunting formed a regular branch of the revenue service. In\r\nCicero’s time whole provinces of Asia Minor were stripped bare by the\r\ntraffic. The effect upon the Latin society of the fifth century before\r\nChrist was singularly destructive. Italy was filled with petty states\r\nin chronic war, the troops were an unpaid militia, which comprised the\r\nwhole able-bodied population, and though the farms yielded enough for\r\nthe family in good times, when the males were with the legions labour\r\nwas certain to be lacking. The campaigns therefore brought want, and\r\nwith want came the inability to pay taxes.\r\n\r\nAs late as the Tunic War, Regulus asked to be relieved from his\r\ncommand, because the death of his slave and the incompetence of his\r\nhired man left his fields uncared for; and if a general and a consul\r\nwere pinched by absence, the case of the men in the ranks can be\r\nimagined. Even in victory the lot of the common soldier was hard\r\nenough, for, beside the chance of wounds and disease, there was the\r\ncertain loss of time, for which no compensation was made. Though the\r\nplebeians formed the whole infantry of the line, they received no part\r\nof the conquered lands, and even the plunder was taken from them, and\r\nappropriated by the patricians to their private use.[8] In defeat, the\r\nopen country was overrun, the cattle were driven off or slaughtered,\r\nthe fruit trees cut down, the crops laid waste, and the houses burned.\r\nIn speaking of the Gallic invasion, Niebuhr has pointed out that the\r\nravaging of the enemy, and the new taxes laid to rebuild the ruined\r\npublic works, led to general insolvency.[9]\r\n\r\nSuch conditions fostered the rapid propagation of distinct types of\r\nmind, and at a very early period Romans had been bred destitute of the\r\nmartial instinct, but more crafty and more tenacious of life than the\r\nsoldier. These were the men who conceived and enforced the usury laws,\r\nand who held to personal pledges as the dearest privilege of their\r\norder; nor does Livy attempt to disguise the fact “that every patrician\r\nhouse was a gaol for debtors; and that in seasons of great distress,\r\nafter every sitting of the courts, herds of sentenced slaves were led\r\naway in chains to the houses of the nobless.”[10]\r\n\r\nOf this redoubtable type the Claudian family was a famous specimen,\r\nand the picture which has been drawn by Macaulay of the great usurer,\r\nAppius Claudius, the decemvir, is so brilliant that it cannot be\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n   “Appius Claudius Crassus ... was descended from a long line of\r\n    ancestors distinguished by their haughty demeanour, and by the\r\n    inflexibility with which they had withstood all the demands\r\n    of the plebeian order. While the political conduct and the\r\n    deportment of the Claudian nobles drew upon them the fiercest\r\n    public hatred, they were accused of wanting, if any credit\r\n    is due to the early history of Rome, a class of qualities\r\n    which, in a military commonwealth, is sufficient to cover a\r\n    multitude of offences. The chiefs of the family appear to have\r\n    been eloquent, versed in civil business, and learned after the\r\n    fashion of their age; but in war they were not distinguished\r\n    by skill or valour. Some of them, as if conscious where their\r\n    weakness lay, had, when filling the highest magistracies, taken\r\n    internal administration as their department of public business,\r\n    and left the military command to their colleagues. One of them\r\n    had been entrusted with an army, and had failed ignominiously.\r\n    None of them had been honoured with a triumph....\r\n\r\n   “His grandfather, called, like himself, Appius Claudius, had\r\n    left a name as much detested as that of Sextus Tarquinius. This\r\n    elder Appius had been consul more than seventy years before\r\n    the introduction of the Licinian Laws. By availing himself\r\n    of a singular crisis in public feeling, he had obtained the\r\n    consent of the commons to the abolition of the tribuneship, and\r\n    had been the chief of that Council of Ten to which the whole\r\n    direction of the State had been committed. In a few months\r\n    his administration had become universally odious. It had been\r\n    swept away by an irresistible outbreak of popular fury; and\r\n    its memory was still held in abhorrence by the whole city. The\r\n    immediate cause of the downfall of this execrable government\r\n    was said to have been an attempt made by Appius Claudius upon\r\n    the chastity of a beautiful young girl of humble birth. The\r\n    story ran that the Decemvir, unable to succeed by bribes and\r\n    solicitations, resorted to an outrageous act of tyranny. A vile\r\n    dependant of the Claudian house laid claim to the damsel as his\r\n    slave. The cause was brought before the tribunal of Appius.\r\n    The wicked magistrate, in defiance of the clearest proofs,\r\n    gave judgment for the claimant. But the girl’s father, a brave\r\n    soldier, saved her from servitude and dishonour by stabbing her\r\n    to the heart in the sight of the whole Forum. That blow was the\r\n    signal for a general explosion. Camp and city rose at once; the\r\n    Ten were pulled down; the tribuneship was re-established; and\r\n    Appius escaped the hands of the executioner only by a voluntary\r\n    death.”[11]\r\n\r\nVirginia was slain in 449 B.C., just in the midst of the long\r\nconvulsion which began with the secession to the Mons Sacer, and ended\r\nwith the Licinian Laws. During this century and a quarter, usury\r\ndrained the Roman vitality low. Niebuhr was doubtless right in his\r\nconjecture that the mutinous legions were filled with nexi to whom\r\nthe continuance of the existing status meant slavery, and Mommsen also\r\npointed out that the convulsions of the third and fourth centuries, in\r\nwhich it seemed as though Roman society must disintegrate, were caused\r\nby “the insolvency of the middle class of land-holders.”[12]\r\n\r\nHad Italy been more tranquil, it is not inconceivable that the small\r\nfarmers might even then have sunk into the serfdom which awaited them\r\nunder the Empire, for in peace the patricians might have been able\r\nto repress insurrection with their clients; but the accumulation of\r\ncapital had hardly begun, and several centuries were to elapse before\r\nmoney was to take its ultimate form in a standing army. Meanwhile,\r\ntroops were needed almost every year to defend the city; and, as the\r\nlegions were a militia, they were the enemy and not the instrument of\r\nwealth. Until the organization of a permanent paid police they were,\r\nhowever, the highest expression of force, and, when opposed to them,\r\nthe monied oligarchy was helpless, as was proved by the secession to\r\nthe Mons Sacer. The storm gathered slowly. The rural population was\r\nground down under the usury laws, and in 495 B.C. the farmers refused\r\nto respond to the levy. The consul Publius Servilius had to suspend\r\nprosecutions for debt and to liberate debtors in prison; but at the\r\nend of the campaign the promises he had made in the moment of danger\r\nwere repudiated by Appius Claudius, who rigorously enforced the usury\r\nlegislation, and who was, for the time, too strong to be opposed.\r\n\r\nThat year the men submitted, but the next the legions had again to be\r\nembodied; they again returned victorious; their demands were again\r\nrejected; and then, instead of disbanding, they marched in martial\r\narray into the district of Crustumeria, and occupied the hill which\r\never after was called the Sacred Mount.[13] Resistance was not even\r\nattempted; and precisely the same surrender was repeated in 449. When\r\nVirginius stabbed his daughter he fled to the camp, and his comrades\r\nseized the standards and marched for Rome. The Senate yielded at once,\r\ndecreed the abolition of the Decemvirate, and the triumphant cohorts,\r\ndrawn up upon the Aventine, chose their tribunes.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the last great struggle, when Camillus was made dictator\r\nto coerce the people, he found himself impotent. The monied oligarchy\r\ncollapsed when confronted with an armed force; and Camillus, reduced\r\nto act as mediator, vowed a temple to Concord, on the passage of\r\nthe Licinian Laws.[14] The Licinian Laws provided for a partial\r\nliquidation, and also for an increase of the means of the debtor class\r\nby redistribution of the public land. This land had been seized in war,\r\nand had been monopolized by the patricians without any particular legal\r\nright. Licinius obtained a statute by which back payments of interest\r\nshould be applied to extinguishing the principal of debts, and balances\r\nthen remaining due should be liquidated in three annual instalments.\r\nHe also limited the quantity of the public domain which could be held\r\nby any individual, and directed that the residue which remained after\r\nthe reduction of all estates to that standard should be distributed in\r\nfive-acre lots.\r\n\r\nPyrrhus saw with a soldier’s eye that Rome’s strength did not lie in\r\nher generals, who were frequently his inferiors, but in her farmers,\r\nwhom he could not crush by defeat, and this was the class which was\r\nfavoured by the Licinian Laws. They multiplied greatly when the usurers\r\ncapitulated, and, as Macaulay remarked, the effect of the reform\r\nwas “singularly happy and glorious.” It was indeed no less than the\r\nconquest of Italy. Rome, “while the disabilities of the plebeians\r\ncontinued ... was scarcely able to maintain her ground against the\r\nVolscians and Hernicans. When those disabilities were removed, she\r\nrapidly became more than a match for Carthage and Macedon.”[15]\r\n\r\nBut nature’s very bounty to the Roman husbandman and soldier proved\r\nhis ruin. Patient of suffering, enduring of fatigue, wise in council,\r\nfierce in war, he routed all who opposed him; and yet the vigorous mind\r\nand the robust frame which made him victorious in battle, were his\r\nweakness when at peace. He needed costly nutriment, and when brought\r\ninto free economic competition with Africans and Asiatics, he starved.\r\nSuch competition resulted directly from foreign conquests, and came\r\nrapidly when Italy had consolidated, and the Italians began to extend\r\ntheir power over other races. Nearly five centuries intervened between\r\nthe foundation of the city and the defeat of Pyrrhus, but within little\r\nmore than two hundred years from the victory of Beneventum, Rome was\r\nmistress of the world.\r\n\r\nIndeed, beyond the peninsula, there was not much, save Carthage, to\r\nstop the march of the legions. After the death of Alexander, in 323\r\nB.C., Greece fell into decline, and by 200, when Rome attacked Macedon,\r\nshe was in decrepitude. The population of Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt\r\nwas not martial, and had never been able to cope in battle with the\r\nwestern races; while Spain and Gaul, though inhabited by fierce and\r\nhardy tribes, lacked cohesion, and could not withstand the onset of\r\norganized and disciplined troops. Distance, therefore, rather than\r\nhostile military force, fixed the limit of the ancient centralization,\r\nfor the Romans were not maritime, and consequently failed to absorb\r\nIndia or discover America. Thus their relatively imperfect movement\r\nmade the most material difference between the ancient and modern\r\neconomic system.\r\n\r\nBy conquest the countries inhabited by races of a low vitality and\r\ngreat tenacity of life were opened both for trade and slaving, and\r\ntheir cheap labour exterminated the husbandmen of Italy. Particularly\r\nafter the annexation of Asia Minor this labour overran Sicily, and the\r\ncultivation of the cereals by the natives became impossible when the\r\nisland had been parcelled out into great estates stocked by capitalists\r\nwith eastern slaves who, at Rome, undersold all competitors. During\r\nthe second century the precious metals poured into Latium in a flood,\r\ngreat fortunes were amassed and invested in land, and the Asiatic\r\nprovinces of the Empire were swept of their men in order to make\r\nthese investments pay. No data remain by which to estimate, even\r\napproximately, the size of this involuntary migration, but it must\r\nhave reached enormous numbers, for sixty thousand captives were the\r\ncommon booty of a campaign, and after provinces were annexed they were\r\ndepopulated by the publicans.\r\n\r\nThe best field hands came from the regions where poverty had always\r\nbeen extreme, and where, for countless generations, men had been\r\ninured to toil on scanty food. Districts like Bithynia and Syria, where\r\nslaves could be bought for little or nothing, had always been tilled\r\nby races far more tenacious of life than any Europeans. After Lucullus\r\nplundered Pontus, a slave brought only four drachmæ, or, perhaps,\r\nseventy cents.[16] On the other hand, competition grew sharper among\r\nthe Italians themselves. As capital accumulated in the hands of the\r\nstrongest, the poor grew poorer, and pauperism spread. As early as the\r\nMarsian War, in 90 B.C., Lucius Marcius Philippus estimated that there\r\nwere only two thousand wealthy families among the burgesses. In about\r\nthree hundred years nature had culled a pure plutocracy from what had\r\nbeen originally an essentially martial race.\r\n\r\nThe primitive Roman was a high order of husbandman, who could only when\r\nwell fed flourish and multiply. He was adapted to that stage of society\r\nwhen the remnants of caste gave a certain fixity of tenure to the\r\nfarmer, and when prices were maintained by the cost of communication\r\nwith foreign countries. As the world centralized, through conquest,\r\nthese barriers were swept away. Economic competition became free,\r\nland tended to concentrate in fewer and fewer hands, and this land was\r\nworked by eastern slaves, who reduced the wages of labour to the lowest\r\npoint at which the human being can survive.\r\n\r\nThe effect was to split society in halves, the basis being servile, and\r\nthe freemen being separated into a series of classes, according to the\r\neconomic power of the mind. Wealth formed the title to nobility of the\r\ngreat oligarchy which thus came to constitute the core of the Empire.\r\nAt the head stood the senators, whose rank was hereditary unless they\r\nlost their property, for to be a senator a man had to be rich. Augustus\r\nfixed $48,000 as the minimum of the senatorial fortune, and made up the\r\ndeficiency to certain favoured families,[17] but Tiberius summarily\r\nejected spendthrifts.[18] All Latin literature is redolent of money.\r\nTacitus, with an opulent connection, never failed to speak with disdain\r\nof the base-born, or, in other words, of the less prosperous. “Poppæus\r\nSabinus, a man of humble birth,” raised to position by the caprice of\r\ntwo emperors;[19] “Cassius Severus, a man of mean extraction”;[20] and,\r\nin the poetry of antiquity, there are few more famous lines than those\r\nin which Juvenal has described the burden of poverty:\r\n\r\n   “Haud facile emergunt, quorum virtutibus obstat\r\n    Res angusta domi.”[21]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no modern writer has been so imbued with the spirit of the\r\nlater Empire as Fustel de Coulanges, and on this subject he has been\r\nemphatic. Not only were the Romans not democratic, but at no period of\r\nher history did Rome love equality. In the Republic rank was determined\r\nby wealth. The census was the basis of the social system. Every citizen\r\nhad to declare his fortune before a magistrate, and his grade was then\r\nassigned him. “Poverty and wealth established the legal differences\r\nbetween men.”\r\n\r\nThe first line of demarcation lay between those who owned land and\r\nthose who did not. The former were _assidui_: householders rooted in\r\nthe soil. The latter were _proletarians_. The _proletarians_ were equal\r\nin their poverty; but the _assidui_ were unequal in their wealth, and\r\nwere consequently divided into five classes. Among these categories all\r\nwas unequal--taxes, military service, and political rights. They did\r\nnot mix together.\r\n\r\n“If one transports oneself to the last century of the Republic ...\r\none finds there an aristocracy as strongly consolidated as the ancient\r\npatrician.... At the summit came the senatorial order. To belong to it\r\nthe first condition was to possess a great fortune.... The Roman mind\r\ndid not understand that a poor man could belong to the aristocracy, or\r\nthat a rich man was not part of it.”[22]\r\n\r\nArchaic customs lingered late in Rome, for the city was not a centre\r\nof commercial exchanges; and long after the death of Alexander, when\r\nGreece passed its meridian, the Republic kept its copper coinage.\r\nRegulus farmed his field with a single slave and a hired servant,\r\nand there was, in truth, nothing extraordinary in the famous meeting\r\nwith Cincinnatus at the plough, although such simplicity astonished\r\na contemporary of Augustus. Advancing centralization swept away these\r\nancient customs, a centralization whose march is, perhaps, as sharply\r\nmarked by the migration of vagrants to the cities, as by any single\r\nphenomenon. Vagrant paupers formed the proletariat for whose relief\r\nthe “Frumentariæ Leges” were framed; and yet, though poor-laws in some\r\nform are considered a necessity in modern times, few institutions of\r\nantiquity have been more severely criticised than those regulating\r\ncharity. From the time of Cato downward, the tendency has been to\r\nmaintain that at Rome demagogues fed the rabble at the cost of the\r\nlives of the free-holders.\r\n\r\nProbably the exact converse is the truth; the public gifts of food\r\nappear to have been the effect of the ruin of agriculture, and not\r\nits cause. After the Italian husbandmen had been made insolvent by\r\nthe competition of races of lower vitality, they flocked starving to\r\nthe capital, but it was only reluctantly that the great speculators in\r\ngrain, who controlled the Senate, admitted the necessity of granting\r\nState aid to the class whom they had destroyed.\r\n\r\nLong before the Punic Wars the Carthaginians had farmed Sicily on\r\ncapitalistic principles; that is to say, they had stocked domains with\r\nslaves, and had traded on the basis of large sales and narrow profits.\r\nThe Romans when they annexed the island only carried out this system to\r\nits logical end. Having all Asia Minor to draw upon for labour, they\r\ndeliberately starved and overworked their field-hands, since it was\r\ncheaper to buy others than to lose command of the market. The familiar\r\nstory of the outbreak of the Servile War, about 134 B.C., shows how far\r\nthe contemporaries of the Sicilian speculators believed them capable of\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nDamophilus, an opulent Sicilian landlord, being one day implored by his\r\nslaves to have pity on their nakedness and misery, indignantly demanded\r\nwhy they went hungry and cold, with arms in their hands, and the\r\ncountry before them. Then he bound them to stakes and flayed them with\r\nthe lash.[23]\r\n\r\nThe reduction of Syracuse by Marcellus broke the Carthaginian power\r\nin the island, and, after the fall of Agrigentum in 210 B.C., the\r\npacification of the country went on rapidly. Probably from the outset,\r\neven in the matter of transportation, the provinces of the mainland\r\nwere at a disadvantage because of the cheapness of sea freights, but\r\nat all events the opening of the Sicilian grain trade had an immediate\r\nand disastrous effect on Italy. The migration of vagrants to Rome began\r\nforthwith, and within seven years, 203 B.C., a public distribution of\r\nwheat took place, probably by the advice of Scipio. Nevertheless the\r\ncharity was private and not gratuitous. On the contrary, a charge of\r\nsix sesterces, or twenty-five cents the bushel, was made, apparently\r\nnear half the market rate, a price pretty regularly maintained on such\r\noccasions down to the Empire. This interval comprehended the whole\r\nperiod of the Sicilian supremacy in the corn trade, for in 30 B.C.\r\nEgypt was annexed by Augustus.\r\n\r\nThe distress which followed upon free trade with Egypt finally broke\r\ndown the resistance of the rich to gratuitous relief for the poor.\r\nPreviously the opposition to State aid had been so stubborn that until\r\n123 B.C. no legal provision whatever was made for paupers; and yet the\r\naccount left by Polybius of the condition of Lombardy toward the middle\r\nof the second century shows the complete wreck of agriculture.\r\n\r\n“The yield of corn in this district is so abundant that wheat is\r\noften sold at four obols a Sicilian medimnus [about eight cents by\r\nthe bushel, or a little less than two sesterces], barley at two, or\r\na metretes of wine for an equal measure of barley.... The cheapness\r\nand abundance of all articles of food may also be clearly shown from\r\nthe fact that travellers in these parts, when stopping at inns, do not\r\nbargain for particular articles, but simply ask what the charge is per\r\nhead for board. And for the most part the innkeepers are content” with\r\nhalf an as (about half a cent) a day.[24]\r\n\r\nThese prices indicate a lack of demand so complete, that the debtors\r\namong the peasantry must have been ruined, and yet tax-payers remained\r\nobdurate. Gratuitous distributions were tried in 58 B.C. by the Lex\r\nClodia, but soon abandoned as costly, and Cæsar applied himself to\r\nreducing the outlay on the needy. He hoped to reach his end by cutting\r\ndown the number of grain-receivers one-half, by providing that no\r\ngrain should be given away except on presentation of a ticket, and by\r\nordering that the number of ticket-holders should not be increased. The\r\nlaw of nature prevailed against him, for the absorption of Egypt in the\r\neconomic system of the Empire, marked, in the words of Mommsen “the end\r\nof the old and the beginning of a new epoch.”[25]\r\n\r\nAmong the races which have survived through ages upon scanty nutriment,\r\nnone have, perhaps, excelled the Egyptian fellah. Even in the East no\r\npeasantry has probably been so continuously overworked, so under-paid,\r\nand so taxed.\r\n\r\n   “If it is the aim of the State to work out the utmost possible\r\n    amount from its territory, in the Old World the Lagids were\r\n    absolutely the masters of statecraft. In particular they\r\n    were in this sphere the instructors and the models of the\r\n    Cæsars.”[26]\r\n\r\nIn the first century Egypt was, as it still is, preeminently a land\r\nof cheap labour; but it was also something more. The valley of the\r\nNile, enriched by the overflow of the river, returned an hundred-fold,\r\nwithout manure; and this wonderful district was administered, not like\r\nan ordinary province, but like a private farm belonging to the citizens\r\nof Rome. The emperor reserved it to himself. How large a revenue he\r\ndrew from it is immaterial; it suffices that one-third of all the\r\ngrain consumed in the capital came from thence. According to Athenæus,\r\nsome of the grain ships in use were about 420 feet long by 57 broad,\r\nor nearly the size of a modern steamer in the Atlantic trade.[27]\r\nFrom the beginning of the Christian era, therefore, the wages of the\r\nEgyptian fellah regulated the price of the cereals within the limits\r\nwhere trade was made free by Roman consolidation, and it is safe to\r\nsay that, thenceforward, such of the highly nourished races as were\r\nconstrained to sustain this competition, were doomed to perish. It\r\nis even extremely doubtful whether the distributions of grain by the\r\ngovernment materially accelerated the march of the decay. Spain should\r\nhave been far enough removed from the centre of exchanges to have had\r\na certain local market of her own, and yet Martial, writing about 100\r\nA.D., described the Spanish husbandman eating and drinking the produce\r\nhe could not sell, and receiving but four sesterces the bushel for his\r\nwheat, which was the price paid by paupers in the time of Cicero.[28]\r\n\r\nThus by economic necessity great estates were formed in the hands of\r\nthe economically strong. As the value of cereals fell, arable land\r\npassed into vineyards or pasture, and, the provinces being unable to\r\nsustain their old population, eviction went on with gigantic strides.\r\nHad the Romans possessed the versatility to enable them to turn\r\nto industry, factories might have afforded a temporary shelter to\r\nthis surplus labour, but manufactures were monopolized by the East;\r\ntherefore the beggared peasantry were either enslaved for debt, or\r\nwandered as penniless paupers to the cities, where gradually their\r\nnumbers so increased as to enable them to extort a gratuitous dole.\r\nIndeed, during the third century, their condition fell so low that they\r\nwere unable even to cook the food freely given them, and Aurelian had\r\ntheir bread baked at public ovens.[29]\r\n\r\nAs centralization advanced with the acceleration of human movement,\r\nforce expressed itself more and more exclusively through money, and\r\nthe channel in which money chose to flow was in investments in land.\r\nThe social system fostered the growth of large estates. The Romans\r\nalways had an inordinate respect for the landed magnate, and a contempt\r\nfor the tradesman. Industry was reputed a servile occupation, and,\r\nunder the Republic, the citizen who performed manual labour was almost\r\ndeprived of political rights. Even commerce was thought so unworthy\r\nof the aristocracy that it was forbidden to senators. “The soil was\r\nalways, in this Roman society, the principal source and, above all, the\r\nonly measure of wealth.”\r\n\r\nA law of Tiberius obliged capitalists to invest two-thirds of their\r\nproperty in land. Trajan not only exacted of aspirants to office that\r\nthey should be rich, but that they should place at least one-third\r\nof their fortune in Italian real estate; and, down to the end of the\r\nEmpire, the senatorial class “was at the same time the class of great\r\nlanded proprietors.”[30]\r\n\r\nThe more property consolidated, the more resistless the momentum\r\nof capital became. Under the Empire small properties grew steadily\r\nrarer, and the fewer they were, the greater the disadvantage at which\r\ntheir owners stood. The small farmer could hardly sustain himself\r\nin competition with the great landlord. The grand domain of the\r\ncapitalist was not only provided with a full complement of labourers,\r\nvine-dressers, and shepherds, but with the necessary artisans. The\r\npoor farmer depended on his rich neighbour even for his tools. “He was\r\nwhat a workman would be to-day who, amidst great factories, worked\r\nalone.”[31] He bought dearer and sold cheaper, his margin of profit\r\nsteadily shrunk; at last he was reduced to a bare subsistence in good\r\nyears, and the first bad harvest left him bankrupt.\r\n\r\nThe Roman husbandman and soldier was doomed, for nature had turned\r\nagainst him; the task of history is but to ascertain his fate, and\r\ntrace the fortunes of his country after he had gone.\r\n\r\nOf the evicted, many certainly drifted to the cities and lived upon\r\ncharity, forming the proletariat, a class alike despised and lost to\r\nself-respect: some were sold into slavery, others starved; but when all\r\ndeductions have been made, a surplus is left to be accounted for, and\r\nthere is reason to suppose that these stayed on their farms as tenants\r\nto the purchasers.\r\n\r\nIn the first century such tenancies were common. The lessee remained\r\na freeman, under no subjection to his landlord, provided he paid his\r\nrent; but in case of default the law was rigorous. Everything upon the\r\nland was liable as a pledge, and the tenant himself was held in pawn\r\nunless he could give security for what he owed. In case, therefore,\r\nof prolonged agricultural depression, all that was left of the ancient\r\nrural population could hardly fail to pass into the condition of serfs,\r\nbound to the land by debts beyond the possibility of payment.\r\n\r\nThat such a depression actually occurred, and that it extended through\r\nseveral centuries, is certain. Nor is it possible that its only cause\r\nwas Egyptian competition, for had it been so, an equilibrium would have\r\nbeen reached when the African exchanges had been adjusted, whereas a\r\ncontinuous decline of prices went on until long after the fall of the\r\nWestern Empire. The only other possible explanation of the phenomenon\r\nis that a contraction of the currency began soon after the death of\r\nAugustus, and continued without much interruption down to Charlemagne.\r\nBetween the fall of Carthage and the birth of Christ, the Romans\r\nplundered the richest portions of the world west of the Indus; in the\r\nsecond century, North Africa, Macedon, Spain, and parts of Greece and\r\nAsia Minor; in the first, Athens, Cappadocia, Syria, Gaul, and Egypt.\r\nThese countries yielded an enormous mass of treasure, which was brought\r\nto Rome as spoil of war, but which was not fixed there by commercial\r\nexchanges, and which continually tended to flow back to the natural\r\ncentres of trade. Therefore, when conquests ceased, the sources of\r\nnew bullion dried up, and the quantity held in Italy diminished as the\r\nbalance of trade grew more and more unfavourable.\r\n\r\nUnder Augustus the precious metals were plenty and cheap, and the\r\nprices of commodities were correspondingly high; but a full generation\r\nhad hardly passed before a dearth began to be felt, which manifested\r\nitself in a debasement of the coinage, the surest sign of an\r\nappreciation of the currency.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the manufactures and the more costly products of\r\nantiquity came from countries to the east of the Adriatic, while the\r\nWest was mainly agricultural; and nothing is better established than\r\nthat luxuries were dear under the Empire, and food cheap.[32] Therefore\r\nexchanges were unfavourable to the capital from the outset; the exports\r\ndid not cover the imports, and each year a deficit had to be made good\r\nin specie.\r\n\r\nThe Romans perfectly understood the situation, and this adverse balance\r\ncaused them much uneasiness. Tiberius dwelt upon it in a letter to the\r\nSenate as early as 22 A.D. In that year the ædiles brought forward\r\nproposals for certain sumptuary reforms, and the Senate, probably\r\nto rid itself of a delicate question, referred the matter to the\r\nexecutive. Most of the emperor’s reply is interesting, but there is one\r\nparticularly noteworthy paragraph. “If a reform is in truth intended,\r\nwhere must it begin? and how am I to restore the simplicity of ancient\r\ntimes?... How shall we reform the taste for dress?... How are we to\r\ndeal with the peculiar articles of female vanity, and, in particular,\r\nwith that rage for jewels and precious trinkets, which drains the\r\nEmpire of its wealth, and sends, in exchange for bawbles, the money\r\nof the Commonwealth to foreign nations, and even to the enemies of\r\nRome?”[33] Half a century later matters were, apparently, worse, for\r\nPliny more than once returned to the subject. In the twelfth book of\r\nhis Natural History, after enumerating the many well-known spices,\r\nperfumes, drugs, and gems, which have always made the Eastern trade\r\nof such surpassing value, he estimated that at the most moderate\r\ncomputation 100,000,000 sesterces, or about $4,000,000 in coin, were\r\nannually exported to Arabia and India alone; and at a time when silk\r\nwas worth its weight in gold, the estimate certainly does not seem\r\nexcessive. He added, “So dear do pleasures and women cost us.”[34]\r\n\r\nThe drain to Egypt and the Asiatic provinces could hardly have been\r\nmuch less serious. Adrian almost seems to have been jealous of the\r\nformer, for in his letter to Servianus, after having criticised the\r\npeople, he remarked that it was also a rich and productive country\r\n“in which no one was idle,” and in which glass, paper and linen were\r\nmanufactured.[35] The Syrians were both industrial and commercial.\r\nTyre, for example, worked the raw silk of China, dyed and exported\r\nit. The glass of Tyre and Sidon was famous; the local aristocracy were\r\nmerchants and manufacturers, “and, as later the riches acquired in the\r\nEast flowed to Genoa and Venice, so then the commercial gains of the\r\nWest flowed back to Tyre and Apamea.”[36]\r\n\r\nWithin about sixty years from the final consolidation of the Empire\r\nunder Augustus, this continuous efflux of the precious metals began\r\nto cause the currency to contract, and prices to fall; and the first\r\neffect of shrinking values appears to have been a financial crisis in\r\n33 A.D. Probably the diminution in the worth of commodities relatively\r\nto money, had already made it difficult for debtors to meet their\r\nliabilities, for Tacitus has prefaced his story by pointing out that\r\nusury had always been a scourge of Rome, and that just previous to\r\nthe panic an agitation against the money-lenders had begun with a view\r\nto enforcing the law regarding interest. As most of the senators were\r\ndeep in usury they applied for protection to Tiberius, who granted what\r\namounted to a stay of proceedings, and then, as soon as the capitalists\r\nfelt themselves safe, they proceeded to take their revenge. Loans were\r\ncalled, accommodation refused, and mortgagors were ruthlessly sold\r\nout. “There was great scarcity of money ... and, on account of sales\r\non execution, coin accumulated in the imperial, or the public treasury.\r\nUpon this the Senate ordered that every one should invest two-thirds of\r\nhis capital on loan, in Italian real estate; but the creditors called\r\nin the whole, nor did public opinion allow debtors to compromise.”\r\nMeanwhile there was great excitement but no relief, “as the usurers\r\nhoarded for the purpose of buying low. The quantity of sales broke the\r\nmarket, and the more liabilities were extended, the harder liquidation\r\nbecame. Many were ruined, and the loss of property endangered\r\nsocial station and reputation.”[37] The panic finally subsided, but\r\ncontraction went on and next showed itself, twenty-five years later,\r\nin adulterated coinage. From the time of the Punic Wars, about two\r\ncenturies and a half before Christ, the silver denarius, worth nearly\r\nseventeen cents, had been the standard of the Roman currency, and it\r\nkept its weight and purity unimpaired until Nero, when it diminished\r\nfrom 1⁄84 to 1⁄96 of a pound of silver, the pure metal being mixed with\r\n1⁄10 of copper.[38] Under Trajan, toward 100 A.D., the alloy reached\r\ntwenty per cent; under Septimius Severus a hundred years later it had\r\nmounted to fifty or sixty per cent, and by the time of Elagabalus,\r\n220 A.D., the coin had degenerated into a token of base metal, and was\r\nrepudiated by the government.\r\n\r\nSomething similar happened to the gold. The aureus, though it kept its\r\nfineness, lost in weight down to Constantine. In the reign of Augustus\r\nit equalled one-fortieth of a Roman pound of gold, in that of Nero\r\none forty-fifth, in that of Caracalla but one-fiftieth, in that of\r\nDiocletian one-sixtieth, and in that of Constantine one seventy-second,\r\nwhen the coin ceased passing by tale and was taken only by weight.[39]\r\n\r\nThe repudiation of the denarius was an act of bankruptcy; nor did\r\nthe financial position improve while the administration remained at\r\nRome. Therefore the inference is that, toward the middle of the third\r\ncentury, Italy had lost the treasure she had won in war, which had\r\ngradually gravitated to the centre of exchanges. This inference is\r\nconfirmed by history. The movements of Diocletian seem to demonstrate\r\nthat after 250 A.D. Rome ceased to be either the political or\r\ncommercial capital of the world.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably Diocletian must have lived a life of intense activity at\r\nthe focus of affairs, to have raised himself from slavery to the purple\r\nat thirty-nine; and yet Gibbon thought he did not even visit Rome until\r\nhe went thither to celebrate his triumph, after he had been twenty\r\nyears upon the throne. He never seemed anxious about the temper of the\r\ncity. When proclaimed emperor he ignored Italy and established himself\r\nat Nicomedia on the Propontis, where he lived until he abdicated in\r\n305. His personal preferences evidently did not influence him, since\r\nhis successors imitated his policy; and everything points to the\r\nconclusion that he, and those who followed him, only yielded to the\r\nsame resistless force which fixed the economic capital of the world\r\nupon the Bosphorus. In the case of Constantine the operation of this\r\nforce was conspicuous, for it was not only powerful enough to overcome\r\nthe habit of a lifetime, but to cause him to undertake the gigantic\r\ntask of building Constantinople.\r\n\r\nConstantine was proclaimed in Britain in 306, when only thirty-two.\r\nSix years later he defeated Maxentius, and then governed the West alone\r\nuntil his war with Licinius, whom he captured in 323 and afterward put\r\nto death. Thus, at fifty, he returned to the East, after an absence of\r\nnearly twenty years, and his first act was to choose Byzantium as his\r\ncapital, a city nearly opposite Nicomedia.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of events seems plain. Very soon after the insolvency\r\nof the government at Rome, the administration quitted the city and\r\nmoved toward the boundary between Europe and Asia; there, after some\r\nforty years of vacillation, it settled permanently at the true seat of\r\nexchanges, for Constantinople remained the economic centre of the earth\r\nfor more than eight centuries.\r\n\r\nSimilar conclusions may be drawn from the fluctuations of the currency.\r\nAt Rome the coin could not be maintained at the standard, because of\r\nadverse exchanges; but when the political and economic centres had come\r\nto coincide, at a point upon the Bosphorus, depreciation ceased, and\r\nthe aureus fell no further.\r\n\r\nThis migration of capital, which caused the rise of Constantinople,\r\nwas the true opening of the Middle Ages, for it occasioned the\r\ngradual decline of the rural population, and thus brought about the\r\ndisintegration of the West. Victory carried wealth to Rome, and wealth\r\nmanifested its power in a permanent police; as the attack in war\r\ngained upon the defence, and individual resistance became impossible,\r\ntransportation grew cheap and safe, and human movement was accelerated.\r\nThen economic competition began, and intensified as centralization\r\nadvanced, telling always in favour of the acutest intellect and the\r\ncheapest labour. Soon, exchanges became permanently unfavourable,\r\na steady drain of bullion set in to the East, and, as the outflow\r\ndepleted the treasure amassed at Rome by plunder, contraction began,\r\nand with contraction came that fall of prices which first ruined, then\r\nenslaved, and finally exterminated, the native rural population of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Diocletian, the ancient silver currency had long\r\nbeen repudiated, and, in his well-known edict, he spoke of prices as\r\nhaving risen ninefold, when reckoned in the denarii of base metal;\r\nthe purchasing power of pure gold and silver had, however, risen\r\nvery considerably in all the western provinces. Nor was this all. It\r\nappears to be a natural law that when social development has reached\r\na certain stage, and capital has accumulated sufficiently, the class\r\nwhich has had the capacity to absorb it shall try to enhance the\r\nvalue of their property by legislation. This is done most easily by\r\nreducing the quantity of the currency, which is a legal tender for the\r\npayment of debts. A currency obviously gains in power as it shrinks\r\nin volume, and the usurers of Constantinople intuitively condensed to\r\nthe utmost that of the Empire. After the insolvency under Elagabalus,\r\npayments were exacted in gold by weight, and as it grew scarcer its\r\nvalue rose. Aurelian issued an edict limiting its use in the arts; and\r\nwhile there are abundant reasons for inferring that silver also gained\r\nin purchasing power, gold far outstripped it. Although no statistics\r\nremain by which to establish, with any exactness, the movement of\r\nsilver in comparison with commodities, the ratio between the precious\r\nmetals at different epochs is known, and gold appears to have doubled\r\nbetween Cæsar and Romulus Augustulus.\r\n\r\n    47 B.C.                       gold stood to silver as 1 : 8.9\r\n    1 A.D. under Augustus,           “    “       “       1 : 9.3\r\n    100–200, Trajan to Severus,      “    “       “       1 : 9–10\r\n    310, Constantine,                “    “       “       1 : 12.5\r\n    450, Theodosius II.,             “    “       “       1 : 18\r\n\r\nAs gold had become the sole legal tender, this change of ratio\r\nrepresents a diminution, during the existence of the Western Empire, of\r\nat least fifty per cent in the value of property in relation to debt,\r\nleaving altogether out of view the appreciation of silver itself, which\r\nwas so considerable that the government was unable to maintain the\r\ndenarius.[40]\r\n\r\nResistance to the force of centralized wealth was vain. Aurelian’s\r\nattempt to reform the mints is said to have caused a rebellion, which\r\ncost him the lives of seven thousand of his soldiers; and though his\r\npolicy was continued by Probus, and Diocletian coined both metals\r\nagain at a ratio, expansion was so antagonistic to the interests of the\r\nmonied class that, by 360, silver was definitely discarded, and gold\r\nwas made by law the only legal tender for the payment of debts.[41]\r\nFurthermore, the usurers protected themselves against any possible\r\ntampering with the mints by providing that the solidus should pass by\r\nweight and not by tale; that is to say, they reserved to themselves\r\nthe right to reject any golden son which contained less than one\r\nseventy-second of a pound of standard metal, the weight fixed by\r\nConstantine.[42]\r\n\r\nThus, at a time when the exhaustion of the mines caused a failure in\r\nthe annual supply of bullion, the old composite currency was split\r\nin two, and the half retained made to pass by weight alone, so as to\r\nthrow the loss by clipping and abrasion upon the debtor. So strong a\r\ncontraction engendered a steady fall of prices, a fall which tended\r\nrather to increase than diminish as time went on. But in prolonged\r\nperiods of decline in the market value of agricultural products,\r\nfarmers can with difficulty meet a money rent, because the sale of\r\ntheir crops leaves a greater deficit each year, and finally a time\r\ncomes when insolvency can no longer be postponed.\r\n\r\nIn his opening chapter Gibbon described the Empire under the Antonines\r\nas enjoying “a happy period of more than fourscore years” of peace and\r\nprosperity; and yet nothing is more certain than that this halcyon age\r\nwas in reality an interval of agricultural ruin. On this point Pliny\r\nwas explicit, and Pliny was a large land-owner.\r\n\r\nHe wrote one day to Calvisius about an investment, and went at length\r\ninto the condition of the property. A large estate adjoining his own\r\nwas for sale, and he was tempted to buy, “for the land was fertile,\r\nrich, and well watered,” the fields produced vines and wood which\r\npromised a fair return, and yet this natural fruitfulness was marred by\r\nthe misery of the husbandmen. He found that the former owner “had often\r\nseized the ‘pignora,’ or pledges [that is, all the property the tenants\r\npossessed]; and though, by so doing, he had temporarily reduced their\r\narrears, he had left them” without the means of tilling the soil. These\r\ntenants were freemen, who had been unable to meet their rent because of\r\nfalling prices, and who, when they had lost their tools, cattle, and\r\nhousehold effects, were left paupers on the farms they could neither\r\ncultivate nor abandon. Consequently the property had suffered, the\r\nrent had declined, and for these reasons and “the general hardness of\r\nthe times,” its value had fallen from five million to three million\r\nsesterces.[43]\r\n\r\nIn another letter he explained that he was detained at home making new\r\narrangements with his tenants, who were apparently insolvent, for “in\r\nthe last five years, in spite of great concessions, the arrears have\r\nincreased. For this reason most [tenants] take no trouble to diminish\r\ntheir debt, which they despair of paying. Indeed, they plunder and\r\nconsume what there is upon the land, since they think they cannot\r\nsave for themselves.” The remedy he proposed was to make no more money\r\nleases, but to farm on shares.[44]\r\n\r\nThe tone of these letters shows that there was nothing unusual in all\r\nthis. Pliny nowhere intimated that the tenants were to blame, or that\r\nbetter men were to be had. On the contrary, he said emphatically that\r\nin such hard times money could not be collected, and therefore the\r\ninterest of the landlord was to cultivate his estates on shares, taking\r\nthe single precaution to place slaves over the tenants as overseers and\r\nreceivers of the crops.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the digest referred to such arrears as habitual.[45] In\r\nstill another letter to Trajan, Pliny observed, “Continuæ sterilitates\r\ncogunt me de remissionibus cogitare.”[46] Certainly these insolvent\r\nfarmers could have held no better position when working on shares than\r\nbefore their disasters, for as bankrupts they were wholly in their\r\ncreditors’ power, and could be hunted like slaves, and brought back in\r\nfetters if they fled. They were tied to the property by a debt which\r\nnever could be paid, and they and their descendants were doomed to stay\r\nfor ever as _coloni_ or serfs, chattels to be devised or sold as part\r\nof the realty. In the words of the law, “they were considered slaves\r\nof the land.”[47] The ancient martial husbandman had thus “fallen\r\nfrom point to point, from debt to debt, into an almost perpetual\r\nsubjection.”[48] Deliverance was impossible, for payment was out of the\r\nquestion. He was bound to the soil for his life, and his children after\r\nhim inherited his servitude with his debt.\r\n\r\nThe customs, according to which the _coloni_ held, were infinitely\r\nvaried; they differed not only between estates, but between the hands\r\non the same estate. On the whole, however, the life must have been\r\nhard, for the serfs of the Empire did not multiply, and the scarcity of\r\nrural labour became a chronic disease.\r\n\r\nYet, relatively, the position of the _colonus_ was good, for his wife\r\nand children were his own; slavery was the ulcer which ate into the\r\nflesh, and the Roman fiscal system, coupled as it was with usury, was\r\ncalculated to enslave all but the oligarchy who made the laws.\r\n\r\nThe taxes of the provinces were assessed by the censors and then sold\r\nfor cash to the publicans, who undertook the collection. Italy was at\r\nfirst exempted, but after her bankruptcy she shared the common fate.\r\nCompanies were formed to handle these ventures. The knights usually\r\nsubscribed the capital and divided the profits, which corresponded\r\nwith the severity of their administration; and, as the Roman conquests\r\nextended, these companies grew too powerful to be controlled. The\r\nonly officials in a position to act were the provincial governors,\r\nwho were afraid to interfere, and preferred to share in the gains of\r\nthe traffic, rather than to run the risk of exciting the wrath of so\r\ndangerous an enemy.[49]\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny the collection of a rent in money had become\r\nimpossible in the reign of Trajan. The reason was that with a\r\ncontracting currency prices of produce fell, and each year’s crop\r\nnetted less than that of the year before; therefore a rent moderate in\r\none decade was extortionate in the next. But taxes did not fall with\r\nthe fall in values; on the contrary, the tendency of centralization is\r\nalways toward a more costly administration. Under Augustus, one emperor\r\nwith a moderate household sufficed; but in the third century Diocletian\r\nfound it necessary to reorganize the government under four Cæsars, and\r\neverything became specialized in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nIn this way the people were caught between the upper and the nether\r\nmillstone. The actual quantity of bullion taken from them was\r\ngreater, the lower prices of their property fell, and arrears of taxes\r\naccumulated precisely as Pliny described the accumulation of arrears\r\nof rent. These arrears were carried over from reign to reign, and even\r\nfrom century to century; and Petronius, the father-in-law of Valens, is\r\nsaid to have precipitated the rebellion of Procopius, by exacting the\r\ntribute unpaid since the death of Aurelian a hundred years before.\r\n\r\nThe processes employed in the collection of the revenue were severe.\r\nTorture was freely used,[50] and slavery was the fate of defaulters.\r\nArmed with such power, the publicans held debtors at their mercy.\r\nThough usury was forbidden, the most lucrative part of the trade\r\nwas opening accounts with the treasury, assuming debts, and charging\r\ninterest sometimes as high as fifty per cent. Though, as prices fell,\r\nthe pressure grew severer, the abuses of the administration were never\r\nperhaps worse than toward the end of the Republic. In his oration\r\nagainst Verres, Cicero said the condition of the people had become\r\nintolerable: “All the provinces are in mourning, all the nations that\r\nare free are complaining; every kingdom is expostulating with us about\r\nour covetousness and injustice.”[51]\r\n\r\nThe well-known transactions of Brutus are typical of what went on\r\nwherever the Romans marched. Brutus lent the Senate of Salaminia at\r\nforty-eight per cent a year. As the contract was illegal, he obtained\r\ntwo decrees of the Senate at Rome for his protection, and then to\r\nenforce payment of his interest, Scaptius, his man of business,\r\nborrowed from the governor of Cilicia a detachment of troops. With\r\nthis he blockaded the Senate so closely that several members starved\r\nto death. The Salaminians, wanting at all costs to free themselves from\r\nsuch a load, offered to pay off both interest and capital at once; but\r\nto this Brutus would not consent, and to impose his own terms upon the\r\nprovince he demanded from Cicero more troops, “only fifty horse.”[52]\r\n\r\nWhen at last, by such proceedings, the debtors were so exhausted\r\nthat no torment could wring more from them, they were sold as slaves;\r\nNicodemus, king of Bithynia, on being reproached for not furnishing his\r\ncontingent of auxiliaries, replied that all his able-bodied subjects\r\nhad been taken by the farmers of the revenue.[53] Nor, though the\r\nadministration doubtless was better regulated under the Empire than\r\nunder the Republic, did the oppression of the provinces cease. Juvenal,\r\nwho wrote about 100, implored the young noble taking possession\r\nof his government to put some curb upon his avarice, “to pity the\r\npoverty of the allies. You see the bones of kings sucked of their very\r\nmarrow.”[54] And though the testimony of Juvenal may be rejected as\r\nsavouring too much of poetical licence, Pliny must always be treated\r\nwith respect. When Maximus was sent to Achaia, Pliny thought it well\r\nto write him a long letter of advice, in which he not only declared\r\nthat to wrest from the Greeks the shadow of liberty left them would be\r\n“durum, ferum, barbarumque;” but adjured him to try to remember what\r\neach city had been, and not to despise it for what it was.[55]\r\n\r\nMost impressive, perhaps, of all, is the statement of Dio Cassius that\r\nthe revolt led by Boadicea in Britain in 61 A.D., which cost the Romans\r\nseventy thousand lives, was provoked by the rapacity of Seneca, who,\r\nhaving forced a loan of ten million drachmas ($1,670,000) on the people\r\nat usurious interest, suddenly withdrew his money, thereby inflicting\r\nintense suffering.[56] As Pliny said with bitterness and truth, “The\r\narts of avarice were those most cultivated at Rome.”[57]\r\n\r\nThe stronger type exterminated the weaker; the money-lender killed out\r\nthe husbandman; the race of soldiers vanished, and the farms, whereon\r\nthey had once flourished, were left desolate. To quote the words\r\nof Gibbon: “The fertile and happy province of Campania ... extended\r\nbetween the sea and the Apennines from the Tiber to the Silarus. Within\r\nsixty years after the death of Constantine, and on the evidence of an\r\nactual survey, an exemption was granted in favour of three hundred and\r\nthirty thousand English acres of desert and uncultivated land; which\r\namounted to one-eighth of the whole surface of the province.”[58]\r\n\r\nIt is true that Gibbon, in this paragraph, described Italy as she\r\nwas in the fourth century, just before the barbarian invasions, but a\r\nsimilar fate had overtaken the provinces under the Cæsars. In the reign\r\nof Domitian, according to Plutarch, Greece had been almost depopulated.\r\n\r\n   “She can with much difficulty raise three thousand men, which\r\n    number the single city of Megara sent heretofore to the battle\r\n    of Platæa.... For of what use would the oracle be now, which\r\n    was heretofore at Tegyra or at Ptous? For scarcely shall you\r\n    meet, in a whole day’s time, with so much as a herdsman or\r\n    shepherd in those parts.”[59]\r\n\r\nWallon has observed that Rome, “in the early times of the Republic,\r\nwas chiefly preoccupied with having a numerous and strong population of\r\nfreemen. Under the Empire she had but one anxiety--taxes.”[60]\r\n\r\nTo speak with more precision, force changed the channel through which\r\nit operated. Native farmers and native soldiers were needless when\r\nsuch material could be bought cheaper in the North or East. With money\r\nthe cohorts could be filled with Germans; with money, slaves and serfs\r\ncould be settled upon the Italian fields; and for the last century,\r\nbefore the great inroads began, one chief problem of the imperial\r\nadministration was the regulation of the inflow of new blood from\r\nwithout, lacking which the social system must have collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe later campaigns on the Rhine and the Danube were really slave-hunts\r\non a gigantic scale. Probus brought back sixteen thousand men from\r\nGermany, “the bravest and most robust of their youth,” and distributed\r\nthem in knots of fifty or sixty among the legions. “Their aid was\r\nnow become necessary.... The infrequency of marriage, and the ruin\r\nof agriculture, affected the principles of population; and not only\r\ndestroyed the strength of the present, but intercepted the hope of\r\nfuture generations.”[61]\r\n\r\nHis importations of agricultural labour were much more considerable. In\r\na single settlement in Thrace, Probus established one hundred thousand\r\nBastarnæ; Constantius Chlorus is said to have made Gaul flourish by\r\nthe herds of slaves he distributed among the landlords; in 370, large\r\nnumbers of Alemanni were planted in the valley of the Po, and on the\r\nvast spaces of the public domain there were barbarian villages where\r\nthe native language and customs were preserved.\r\n\r\nProbably none of these Germans came as freemen. Many, of course,\r\nwere captives sold as slaves, but perhaps the majority were serfs.\r\nFrequently a tribe, hard pressed by enemies, asked leave to pass\r\nthe frontier, and settle as tributaries, that is to say as _coloni_.\r\nOn one such occasion Constantius II. was nearly murdered. A body of\r\nLimigantes, who had made a raid, surrendered, and petitioned to be\r\ngiven lands at any distance, provided they might have protection. The\r\nemperor was delighted at the prospect of such a harvest of labourers,\r\nto say nothing of recruits, and went among them to receive their\r\nsubmission. Seeing him alone, the barbarians attacked him, and he\r\nescaped with difficulty. His troops slaughtered the Germans to the last\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThis unceasing emigration gradually changed the character of the\r\nrural population, and a similar alteration took place in the army.\r\nAs early as the time of Cæsar, Italy was exhausted; his legions were\r\nmainly raised in Gaul, and as the native farmers sank into serfdom or\r\nslavery, and then at last vanished, recruits were drawn more and more\r\nfrom beyond the limits of the Empire. At first they were taken singly,\r\nafterwards in tribes and nations, so that, when Aëtius defeated Attila\r\nat Châlons, the battle was fought by the Visigoths under Theodoric, and\r\nthe equipment of the Romans and Huns was so similar that when drawn up\r\nthe lines “presented the image of civil war.”\r\n\r\nThis military metamorphosis indicated the extinction of the martial\r\ntype, and it extended throughout society. Rome not only failed to\r\nbreed the common soldier, she also failed to produce generals. After\r\nthe first century, the change was marked. Trajan was a Spaniard,\r\nSeptimius Severus an African, Aurelian an Illyrian peasant, Diocletian\r\na Dalmatian slave, Constantius Chlorus a Dardanian noble, and the son\r\nof Constantius, by a Dacian woman, was the great Constantine.\r\n\r\nAll these men were a peculiar species of military adventurer, for\r\nthey combined qualities which made them, not only effective chiefs\r\nof police, but acceptable as heads of the civil bureaucracy, which\r\nrepresented capital. Severus was the type, and Severus has never been\r\nbetter described than by Machiavelli, who said he united the ferocity\r\nof the lion to the cunning of the fox. This bureaucracy was the core\r\nof the consolidated mass called the Empire; it was the embodiment of\r\nmoney, the ultimate expression of force, and it recognized and advanced\r\nmen who were adapted to its needs. When such men were to be found, the\r\nadministration was thought good; but when no one precisely adapted for\r\nthe purple appeared, and an ordinary officer had to be hired to keep\r\nthe peace, friction was apt to follow, and the soldier, even though of\r\nthe highest ability, was often removed. Both Stilicho and Aëtius were\r\nmurdered.\r\n\r\nThe monied oligarchy which formed this bureaucracy was a growth as\r\ncharacteristic of the high centralization of the age, as a sacred\r\ncaste is characteristic of decentralization. Perhaps the capitalistic\r\nclass of the later Empire has been better understood and appreciated by\r\nFustel de Coulanges than by any other historian.\r\n\r\n   “All the documents which show the spirit of the epoch show\r\n    that this noblesse was as much honoured by the government as\r\n    respected by the people.... It was from it that the imperial\r\n    government chose ordinarily its high functionaries.”\r\n\r\nThese functionaries were not sought among the lower classes. The high\r\noffices were not given as a reward of long and faithful service; they\r\nbelonged by prescriptive right to the great families. The Empire made\r\nthe wealthy, senators, prætors, consuls, and governors; all dignities,\r\nexcept only the military, were practically hereditary in the opulent\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n   “This class is rich and the government is poor. This class is\r\n    mistress of the larger part of the soil; it is in possession\r\n    of the local dignities, of the administrative and judicial\r\n    functions. The government has only the appearance of power, and\r\n    an armed force which is continually diminishing....\r\n\r\n   “The aristocracy had the land, the wealth, the distinction,\r\n    the education, ordinarily the morality of existence; it did\r\n    not know how to fight and to command. It withdrew itself from\r\n    military service; more than that, it despised it. It was one of\r\n    the characteristic signs of this society to have always placed\r\n    the civil functions not on a level with, but much above, the\r\n    grades of the army. It esteemed much the profession of the\r\n    doctor, of the professor, of the advocate; it did not esteem\r\n    that of the officer and the soldier, and left it to men of low\r\n    estate.”[62]\r\n\r\nThis supremacy of the economic instinct transformed all the relations\r\nof life, the domestic as well as the military. The family ceased\r\nto be a unit, the members of which cohered from the necessity of\r\nself-defence, and became a business association. Marriage took the form\r\nof a contract, dissoluble at the will of either party, and, as it was\r\nsomewhat costly, it grew rare. As with the drain of their bullion to\r\nthe East, which crushed their farmers, the Romans were conscious, as\r\nAugustus said, that sterility must finally deliver their city into the\r\nhand of the barbarians.[63] They knew this and they strove to avert\r\ntheir fate, and there is little in history more impressive than the\r\nimpotence of the ancient civilization in its conflict with nature.\r\nAbout the opening of the Christian era the State addressed itself\r\nto the task. Probably in the year 4 A.D., the emperor succeeded in\r\nobtaining the first legislation favouring marriage, and this enactment\r\nnot proving effective, it was supplemented by the famous Leges Julia\r\nand Papia Poppæa of the year 9. In the spring, at the games, the\r\nknights demanded the repeal of these laws, and then Augustus, having\r\ncalled them to the Forum, made them the well-known speech, whose\r\nviolence now seems incredible. Those who were single were the worst\r\nof criminals, they were murderers, they were impious, they were\r\ndestroyers of their race, they resembled brigands or wild beasts. He\r\nasked the _equites_ if they expected men to start from the ground to\r\nreplace them, as in the fable; and declared in bitterness that while\r\nthe government liberated slaves for the sole purpose of keeping up the\r\nnumber of citizens, the children of the Marcii, of the Fabii, of the\r\nValerii, and the Julii, let their names perish from the earth.[64]\r\n\r\nIn vain celibacy was made almost criminal. In vain celibates were\r\ndeclared incapable of inheriting, while fathers were offered every\r\nbribe, were preferred in appointments to office, were even given the\r\nchoice seats at games; in the words of Tacitus, “not for that did\r\nmarriage and children increase, for the advantages of childlessness\r\nprevailed.”[65] All that was done was to breed a race of informers, and\r\nto stimulate the lawyers to fresh chicane.[66]\r\n\r\nWhen wealth became force, the female might be as strong as the male;\r\ntherefore she was emancipated. Through easy divorce she came to stand\r\non an equality with the man in the marriage contract. She controlled\r\nher own property, because she could defend it; and as she had power,\r\nshe exercised political privileges. In the third century Julia Domna,\r\nJulia Mamæa, Soæmias, and others, sat in the Senate, or conducted the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of this centralized society was as logical as every other\r\nwork of nature. When force reached the stage where it expressed itself\r\nexclusively through money, the governing class ceased to be chosen\r\nbecause they were valiant or eloquent, artistic, learned, or devout,\r\nand were selected solely because they had the faculty of acquiring and\r\nkeeping wealth. As long as the weak retained enough vitality to produce\r\nsomething which could be absorbed, this oligarchy was invincible; and\r\nfor very many years after the native peasantry of Gaul and Italy had\r\nperished under the load, new blood injected from more tenacious races\r\nkept the dying civilization alive.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the monied class lay in their very power, for they not\r\nonly killed the producer, but in the strength of their acquisitiveness\r\nthey failed to propagate themselves. The State feigned to regard\r\nmarriage as a debt, and yet the opulent families died out. In the reign\r\nof Augustus all but fifty of the patrician houses had become extinct,\r\nand subsequently the emperor seemed destined to remain the universal\r\nheir through bequests of the childless.\r\n\r\nWith the peasantry the case was worse. By the second century barbarian\r\nlabour had to be imported to till the fields, and even the barbarians\r\nlacked the tenacity of life necessary to endure the strain. They ceased\r\nto breed, and the population dwindled. Then, somewhat suddenly, the\r\ncollapse came. With shrinking numbers, the sources of wealth ran dry,\r\nthe revenue failed to pay the police, and on the efficiency of the\r\npolice the life of this unwarlike civilization hung.\r\n\r\nIn early ages every Roman had been a land-owner, and every land-owner\r\nhad been a soldier, serving without pay. To fight had been as essential\r\na part of life as to plough. But by the fourth century military service\r\nhad become commercial; the legions were as purely an expression of\r\nmoney as the bureaucracy itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Servian constitution downward, the change in the\r\narmy had kept pace with the acceleration of movement which caused the\r\neconomic competition that centralized the State. Rome owed her triumphs\r\nover Hannibal and Pyrrhus to the valour of her infantry, rather than to\r\nthe genius of her generals; but from Marius the census ceased to be the\r\nbasis of recruitment, and the rich refused to serve in the ranks.\r\n\r\nThis was equivalent in itself to a social revolution; for, from the\r\nmoment when the wealthy succeeded in withdrawing themselves from\r\nservice, and the poor saw in it a trade, the citizen ceased to be a\r\nsoldier, and the soldier became a mercenary. From that time the army\r\ncould be used for “all purposes, provided that they could count on\r\ntheir pay and their booty.”[67]\r\n\r\nThe administration of Augustus organized the permanent police, which\r\nreplaced the mercenaries of the civil wars, and this machine was the\r\ngreatest triumph and the crowning glory of capital. Dio Cassius has\r\ndescribed how the last vestige of an Italian army passed away. Up to\r\nthe time of Severus it had been customary to recruit the Prætorians\r\neither from Italy itself, from Spain, Macedonia, or other neighbouring\r\ncountries, whose population had some affinity with that of Latium.\r\nSeverus, after the treachery of the guard to Pertinax, disbanded it,\r\nand reorganized a corps selected from the bravest soldiers of the\r\nlegions. These men were a horde of barbarians, repulsive to Italians\r\nin their habits, and terrible to look upon.[68] Thus a body of\r\nwage-earners, drawn from the ends of the earth, was made cohesive by\r\nmoney. For more than four hundred years this corps of hirelings crushed\r\nrevolt within the Empire, and regulated the injection of fresh blood\r\nfrom without, with perfect promptitude and precision; nor did it fail\r\nin its functions while the money which vitalized it lasted.\r\n\r\nBut a time came when the suction of the usurers so wasted the life\r\nof the community that the stream of bullion ceased to flow from the\r\ncapital to the frontiers; then, as the sustaining force failed, the\r\nline of troops along the Danube and the Rhine was drawn out until it\r\nbroke, and the barbarians poured in unchecked.\r\n\r\nThe so-called invasions were not conquests, for they were not\r\nnecessarily hostile; they were only the logical conclusion of a process\r\nwhich had been going on since Trajan. When the power to control the\r\nGerman emigration decayed, it flowed freely into the provinces.\r\n\r\nBy the year 400 disintegration was far advanced; the Empire was\r\ncrumbling, not because it was corrupt or degenerate, but because the\r\nmost martial and energetic race the world had ever seen had been so\r\nthoroughly exterminated by men of the economic type of mind, that petty\r\nbands of sorry adventurers might rove whither they would, on what had\r\nonce been Roman soil, without meeting an enemy capable of facing them,\r\nsave other adventurers like themselves. Goths, not Romans, defeated\r\nAttila at Châlons.\r\n\r\nThe Vandals, who, in the course of twenty years, wandered from the Elbe\r\nto the Atlas, were not a nation, not an army, not even a tribe, but a\r\nmotley horde of northern barbarians, ruined provincials, and escaped\r\nslaves--a rabble whom Cæsar’s legions would have scattered like chaff,\r\nhad they been as many as the sands of the shore; and yet when Genseric\r\nrouted Boniface and sacked Carthage, in 439, he led barely fifty\r\nthousand fighting men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE AGE\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the appreciation of the Roman monetary standard culminated\r\nduring the invasion of the Huns toward the middle of the fifth century.\r\nIn the reign of Valentinian III. gold sold for eighteen times its\r\nweight of silver, and Valentinian’s final catastrophe was the murder of\r\nAëtius in 454, with whose life the last spark of vitality at the heart\r\nof Roman centralization died. The rise of Ricimer and the accession\r\nof Odoacer, mark the successive steps by which Italy receded into\r\nbarbarism, and, in the time of Theoderic the Ostrogoth, she had become\r\na primitive, decentralized community, whose poverty and sluggishness\r\nprotected her from African and Asiatic competition. The Ostrogoths\r\nsubdued Italy in 493, and by that date the barbarians had overrun\r\nthe whole civilized world west of the Adriatic, causing the demand\r\nfor money to sustain a consolidated society to cease, the volume of\r\ntrade to shrink, the market for eastern wares to contract, and gold to\r\naccumulate at the centre of exchanges. As gold accumulated, its value\r\nfell, and during the first years of the sixth century it stood at a\r\nratio to silver of less than fifteen to one, a decline of eighteen per\r\ncent.[69] As prices correspondingly rose, the pressure on the peasantry\r\nrelaxed, prosperity at Constantinople returned, and the collapse of the\r\nWestern Empire may have prolonged the life of the European population\r\nof the Eastern for above one hundred and fifty years. The city which\r\nConstantine planted in 324 on the shore of the Bosphorus, was in\r\nreality a horde of Roman capitalists washed to the confines of Asia\r\nby the current of foreign exchanges; and these emigrants carried with\r\nthem, to a land of mixed Greek and barbarian blood, their language and\r\ntheir customs. For many years these monied potentates ruled their new\r\ncountry absolutely. All that legislation could do for them was done.\r\nThey even annexed rations to their estates, to be supplied at the\r\npublic cost, to help their children maintain their palaces. As long as\r\nprices fell, nothing availed; the aristocracy grew poorer day by day.\r\nTheir property lay generally in land, and the same stringency which\r\nwasted Italy and Gaul operated, though perhaps less acutely, upon the\r\nDanubian peasantry also. By the middle of the fifth century the country\r\nwas exhausted and at the mercy of the Huns.\r\n\r\nWealth is the weapon of a monied society; for, though itself lacking\r\nthe martial instinct, it can, with money, hire soldiers to defend it.\r\nBut to raise a revenue from the people, they must retain a certain\r\nsurplus of income after providing for subsistence, otherwise the\r\ngovernment must trench on the supply of daily food, and exhaustion must\r\nsupervene. Finlay has explained that chronic exhaustion was the normal\r\ncondition of Byzantium under the Romans.\r\n\r\n“The whole surplus profits of society were annually drawn into the\r\ncoffers of the State, leaving the inhabitants only a bare sufficiency\r\nfor perpetuating the race of tax-payers. History, indeed, shows that\r\nthe agricultural classes, from the labourer to the landlord, were\r\nunable to retain possession of the savings required to replace that\r\ndepreciation which time is constantly producing in all vested capital,\r\nand that their numbers gradually diminished.”[70]\r\n\r\nUnder Theodosius II., when gold reached its maximum, complete\r\nprostration prevailed. The Huns marched whither they would, and\r\none swarm “of barbarians followed another, as long as anything was\r\nleft to plunder.” The government could no longer keep armies in the\r\nfield. A single example will show how low the community had fallen.\r\nIn 446, Attila demanded of Theodosius six thousand pounds of gold\r\nas a condition of peace, and certainly six thousand pounds of gold,\r\nequalling perhaps $1,370,000, was a small sum, even when measured by\r\nthe standard of private wealth. The end of the third century was not a\r\nprosperous period in Italy, and yet before his election as emperor in\r\n275, the fortune of Tacitus reached 280,000,000 sesterces, or upwards\r\nof $11,000,000.[71] Nevertheless Theodosius was unable to wring this\r\ninconsiderable indemnity from the people, and he had to levy a private\r\nassessment on the senators, who were themselves so poor that to pay\r\nthey sold at auction the jewels of their wives and the furniture of\r\ntheir houses.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the collapse of the Western Empire the tide\r\nturned. With the fall in the price of gold the peasantry revived and\r\nthe Greek provinces flourished. In the reign of Justinian, Belisarius\r\nand Narses marched from end to end of Africa and Europe, and Anastasius\r\nrolled in wealth.\r\n\r\nAnastasius, the contemporary of Theoderic, acceded to the throne in\r\n491. He not only built the famous long wall from the Propontis to the\r\nEuxine, and left behind him a treasure of three hundred and twenty\r\nthousand pounds of gold, but he remitted to his subjects the most\r\noppressive of their taxes, and the reign of Justinian, who succeeded\r\nhim at an interval of only ten years, must always rank as the prime\r\nof the Byzantine civilization. The observation is not new, it has been\r\nmade by all students of Byzantine history.\r\n\r\n“The increased prosperity ... infused into society soon displayed its\r\neffects; and the brilliant exploits of the reign of Justinian must\r\nbe traced back to the reinvigoration of the body politic of the Roman\r\nEmpire by Anastasius.”[72]\r\n\r\nJustinian inherited the throne from his uncle Justin, a Dardanian\r\npeasant, who could neither read nor write. But the barbarian shepherd\r\nwas a thorough soldier, and the army he left behind him was probably\r\nnot inferior to the legions of Titus or Trajan. At all events, had\r\nJustinian’s funds sufficed, there seems reason to suppose he might\r\nhave restored the boundaries of the Empire. His difficulty lay not in\r\nlack of physical force, but in dearth of opulent enemies; in the sixth\r\ncentury conquest had ceased to be profitable. The territory open to\r\ninvasion had been harried for generations, and hardly a country was to\r\nbe found rich enough to repay the cost of a campaign by mercenaries.\r\nTherefore, the more the emperor extended his dominions, the more they\r\nlanguished; and finally to provide for wars, barbarian subsidies, and\r\nbuilding, Justinian had to resort to over-taxation. With renewed want\r\ncame renewed decay, and perhaps the completion of Saint Sophia, in\r\n558, may be taken as the point whence the race which conceived this\r\nmasterpiece hastened to its extinction.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh century Asiatic competition devoured the Europeans\r\nin the Levant, as three hundred years before it had devoured the\r\nhusbandmen of Italy; and this was a disease which isolation alone\r\ncould cure. But isolation of the centre of exchanges was impossible,\r\nfor the vital principle of an economic age is competition, and,\r\nwhen the relief afforded by the collapse of Rome had been exhausted,\r\ncompetition did its work with relentless rapidity. Under Heraclius\r\n(610–640) the population sank fast, and by 717 the western blood\r\nhad run so low that an Asiatic dynasty reigned supreme. Everywhere\r\nGreeks and Romans vanished before Armenians and Slavs, and for years\r\nprevious to the accession of Leo the Isaurian the great waste tracts\r\nwhere they once lived were systematically repeopled by a more enduring\r\nrace. The colonists of Justinian II. furnished him an auxiliary army.\r\nAt Justinian’s death in 711 the revolution had been completed; the\r\npopulation had been renovated, and Constantinople had become an Asiatic\r\ncity.[73] The new aristocracy was Armenian, as strong an economic\r\ntype as ever existed in western Asia; while the Slavic peasantry\r\nwhich underlay them were among the most enduring of mankind. There\r\ncompetition ended, for it could go no further; and, apparently, from\r\nthe accession of Leo in 717, to the rise of Florence and Venice, three\r\nhundred and fifty years later, Byzantine society, in fixity, almost\r\nresembled the Chinese. Such movement as occurred, like Iconoclasm, came\r\nfrom the friction of the migrating races with the old population. As\r\nTexier has observed of architecture: “From the time of Justinian until\r\nthe end of the Empire we cannot remark a single change in the modes of\r\nconstruction.”[74]\r\n\r\nOnly long after, when the money which sustained it was diverted toward\r\nItaly during the crusades, did the social fabric crumble; and Gibbon\r\nhas declared that the third quarter of the tenth century “forms the\r\nmost splendid period of the Byzantine annals.”[75]\r\n\r\nThe later Byzantine was an economic civilization, without aspiration\r\nor imagination, and perhaps the most vivid description which has\r\nsurvived of that ostentatious, sordid, cowardly, and stagnant race, is\r\nthe little sketch of the Jew, Benjamin of Tudela, who travelled to the\r\nLevant in 1173.\r\n\r\nBenjamin called the inhabitants of Constantinople Greeks, because\r\nof their language, and he described the city as a vast commercial\r\nmetropolis, “common to all the world, without distinction of country\r\nor religion.” Merchants from the East and West flocked thither--from\r\nBabylon, Mesopotamia, Media, and Persia, as well as from Egypt,\r\nHungary, Russia, Lombardy, and Spain. The rabbi thought the people well\r\neducated and social, liking to eat and drink, “every man under his vine\r\nand under his fig tree.” They loved gold and jewels, pompous display,\r\nand gorgeous ceremonial; and the Jew has dwelt with delight on the\r\npalace, with its columns of gold and silver, and the wonderful crown so\r\nstudded with gems that it lighted the night without a lamp. The Greeks\r\nalso roused his enthusiasm for the splendour of their clothes and\r\nof their horses’ trappings, for when they went abroad they resembled\r\nprinces; but on the other hand, he remarked with a certain scorn, that\r\nthey were utterly cowardly, and, like women, had to hire men to protect\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n   “The Greeks who inhabit the country are extremely rich and\r\n    possess great wealth of gold and precious stones. They dress\r\n    in garments of silk, ornamented by gold and other valuable\r\n    materials.... Nothing upon earth equals their wealth.”\r\n\r\n   “The Greeks hire soldiers of all nations whom they call\r\n    barbarians, for the purpose of carrying on ... wars with ...\r\n    the Turks.” “They have no martial spirit themselves and like\r\n    women are unfit for war.”[76]\r\n\r\nThe movement of races in the Eastern Empire proceeded with automatic\r\nregularity. The cheaper organism exterminated the more costly, because\r\nenergy operated through money strongly enough to cause free economic\r\ncompetition; nor is the evidence upon which this conclusion rests to\r\nbe drawn from books alone. Coinage and architecture, sculpture and\r\npainting, tell the tale with equal precision.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the fourth century, wealth, ebbing on the Tiber, floated to\r\nthe Bosphorus the core of the Latin aristocracy, it carried with it\r\nalso the Latin coinage. For several generations this coinage underwent\r\nlittle apparent alteration, but after the final division of the Empire,\r\nin 395, between the sons of Theodosius, a subtle change began in the\r\ncomposition of the ruling class; a change reflected from generation\r\nto generation in the issues of their mints. Sabatier has described the\r\ntransformation wrought in eight hundred years with the minuteness of an\r\nantiquary.\r\n\r\nIf a set of Byzantine coins are arranged in chronological order, those\r\nof Anastasius, about 500, show at a glance an influence which is not\r\nLatin. Strange devices have appeared on the reverse, together with\r\nGreek letters. A century later, when the great decline was in progress\r\nunder Heraclius, the type had become barbarous, and the prevalence of\r\nGreek inscriptions proves the steady exhaustion of the Roman blood.\r\nAnother fifty years, and by 690, under Justinian II., the permanent\r\nand conventional phase had been developed. Religious emblems were\r\nused; the head of Christ was struck on the golden son, and fixity\r\nof form presaged the Asiatic domination. The official costumes, the\r\nportraits of the emperors, certain consecrated inscriptions, all were\r\nchangeless; and in 717, an Armenian dynasty ascended the throne in\r\nthe person of Leo the Isaurian.[77] This motionless period lasted for\r\nfull three hundred and fifty years, as long as the exchanges of the\r\nworld centred at Byzantium, and the monied race who dwelt there sucked\r\ncopious nutriment from the pool of wealth in which it lay. But even\r\nbefore the crusades the tide of trade began to flow to the south, and\r\nquitting Constantinople passed directly from Bagdad to the cities of\r\nItaly. Then the sustenance of the money-changers gradually failed. From\r\nthe reign of Michael VI. effigies of the saints were engraved upon the\r\ncoin, and after the revolution led by Alexius Comnenus, in 1081, the\r\nexecution degenerated and debasement began. This revolution marked the\r\nbeginning of the end. Immediately preceding the crusades, and attended\r\nby sharp distress, it was probably engendered by an alteration in the\r\ndrift of foreign exchanges. Certainly the currency contracted sharply,\r\nand the gold money soon became so bad that Alexius had to stipulate to\r\npay his debts in the byzants of his predecessor Michael.[78] For the\r\nnext hundred years, as the Italian cities rose, the Empire languished,\r\nand with the thirteenth century, when Venice established its permanent\r\nsilver standard by coining the “grosso,” Constantinople crumbled into\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nIn architecture the same phenomena appear, only differently clothed.\r\nThough the Germans, who swarmed across the Danube, often surged against\r\nthe walls of Constantinople, they never became the ruling class of the\r\ncommunity, because they were of the imaginative type. Money retained\r\nits supremacy, and while it did so energy expressed itself through the\r\neconomic mind. Though Justinian was of barbarian blood, the nephew\r\nof a barbarian shepherd, the aristocracy about him, which formed\r\nthe core of society, was neither imaginative nor devotional. Hardly\r\nChristian, it tended toward paganism or scepticism. The artists were\r\nof the subject caste, and they earned their living by gratifying the\r\ntastes of the nobles; but the nobles loved magnificence and gorgeous\r\nfunctions; hence all Byzantine architecture favoured display, and\r\nnowhere more so than in Saint Sophia. “Art delighted in representing\r\nChrist in all the splendour of power.... To glorify him the more all\r\nthe magnificence of the imperial court was introduced into heaven....\r\nChrist no longer appeared under the benevolent aspect of the good\r\nshepherd, but in the superb guise of an oriental monarch: he is seated\r\non a throne glittering with gold and precious stones.”[79] Here then\r\nlay the impassable gulf between Byzantium and Paris; while Byzantium\r\nremained economic and materialistic, Paris passed into the glory of an\r\nimaginative age.\r\n\r\nThe Germans who overran the Roman territory were of the same race\r\nas the Greeks, the Latins, or the Gauls, but in a different stage\r\nof development. They tilled farms and built villages and perhaps\r\nfortresses, but they were not consolidated, and had neither nations\r\nnor federations. They were substantially in the condition in which the\r\ncommon family had been, when it divided many centuries before, and\r\ntheir minds differed radically from the minds of the inhabitants of\r\nthe countries beyond the Danube and the Rhine. They were infinitely\r\nmore imaginative, and, as the flood of emigration poured down from the\r\nnorth, the imagination came more and more to prevail.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lowest of existing savages are relatively advanced, they\r\nsuggest that the strongest passion of primeval man must have been fear;\r\nand fear, not so much of living things, as of nature, which seemed to\r\nhim resolutely hostile. Against wild beasts, or savages like himself,\r\nhe might prevail by cunning or by strength; but against drought and\r\nfamine, pestilence and earthquake, he was helpless, and he regarded\r\nthese scourges as malevolent beings, made like himself, only more\r\nformidable. His first and most pressing task was to mollify them, and\r\nabove the warrior class rose the sacred caste, whose function was to\r\nmediate between the visible and the invisible world.\r\n\r\nOriginally these intercessors appear to have been sorcerers, rather\r\nthan priests, for spirits were believed to be hostile to man; and\r\nperhaps the first conception of a god may have been reached through\r\nthe victory of a clan of sorcerers in fight. As Statius said eighteen\r\nhundred years ago, “Primus in orbe deos fecit timor.”[80] Probably the\r\nearly wizards won their power by the discovery of natural secrets,\r\nwhich, though they could be transmitted to their descendants, might\r\nalso be discovered by strangers. The later discoverers would become\r\nrival medicine men, and battle would be the only test by which the\r\northodoxy of the competitors could be determined. The victors would\r\nalmost certainly stigmatize the beings the vanquished served, as\r\ndevils who tormented men. There is an example of this process in the\r\neighteenth chapter of 1 Kings:--\r\n\r\n“And Elijah ... said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the\r\nLord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people\r\nanswered him not a word.”\r\n\r\nThen Elijah proposed that each side should dress a bullock, and lay it\r\non wood, and call upon their spirit; and the one who sent down fire\r\nshould be God. And all the people answered that it was well spoken.\r\nAnd Jezebel’s prophets took their bullock and dressed it, and called\r\non “Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us!” But\r\nnothing came of it.\r\n\r\nThen Elijah mocked them, “and said, Cry aloud: ... either he is\r\ntalking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he\r\nsleepeth, and must be awaked.”\r\n\r\nAnd they cried aloud, and cut themselves with knives till “blood gushed\r\nout upon them. And ... there was neither voice, nor any to answer.”\r\nThen Elijah built his altar, and cut up his bullock and laid him on\r\nwood, and poured twelve barrels of water over the whole, and filled a\r\ntrench with water.\r\n\r\nAnd “the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and\r\nthe wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that\r\nwas in the trench.\r\n\r\n“And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they\r\nsaid, The Lord, he is the God.\r\n\r\n“And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of\r\nthem escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the\r\nbrook Kishon, and slew them there.”\r\n\r\nThe Germans of the fourth century were a very simple race, who\r\ncomprehended little of natural laws, and who therefore referred\r\nphenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention.\r\nThis intervention could only be controlled by priests, and thus the\r\ninvasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class.\r\nThe power of every ecclesiastical organization has always rested on\r\nthe miracle, and the clergy have always proved their divine commission\r\nas did Elijah. This was eminently the case with the mediæval Church.\r\nAt the outset Christianity was socialistic, and its spread among the\r\npoor was apparently caused by the pressure of competition; for the\r\nsect only became of enough importance to be persecuted under Nero,\r\ncontemporaneously with the first signs of distress which appeared\r\nthrough the debasement of the denarius. But socialism was only a\r\npassing phase, and disappeared as the money value of the miracle rose,\r\nand brought wealth to the Church. Under the Emperor Decius, about\r\n250, the magistrates thought the Christians opulent enough to use gold\r\nand silver vessels in their service, and, by the fourth century, the\r\nsupernatural so possessed the popular mind, that Constantine not only\r\nallowed himself to be converted by a miracle, but used enchantment as\r\nan engine of war.\r\n\r\nIn one of his marches, he encouraged the belief that he saw a luminous\r\ncross in the sky, with the words “By this conquer.” The next night\r\nChrist appeared to him, and directed him to construct a standard\r\nbearing the same design, and, armed with this, to advance with\r\nconfidence against Maxentius.\r\n\r\nThe legend, preserved by Eusebius, grew up after the event; but, for\r\nthat very reason, it reflects the feeling of the age. The imagination\r\nof his men had grown so vivid that, whether he believed or not,\r\nConstantine found it expedient to use the Labarum as a charm to ensure\r\nvictory. The standard supported a cross and a mystic monogram; the\r\narmy believed its guards to be invulnerable, and in his last and most\r\ncritical campaign against Licinius, the sight of the talisman not only\r\nexcited his own troops to enthusiasm, but spread dismay through the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Milvian Bridge, fought in 312, by which Constantine\r\nestablished himself at Rome, was probably the point whence nature began\r\nto discriminate decisively against the monied type in Western Europe.\r\nCapital had already abandoned Italy; Christianity was soon after\r\nofficially recognized, and during the next century the priest began to\r\nrank with the soldier as a force in war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as the population sank into exhaustion, it yielded less and\r\nless revenue, the police deteriorated, and the guards became unable\r\nto protect the frontier. In 376, the Goths, hard pressed by the Huns,\r\ncame to the Danube and implored to be taken as subjects by the emperor.\r\nAfter mature deliberation, the Council of Valens granted the prayer,\r\nand some five hundred thousand Germans were cantoned in Mœsia. The\r\nintention of the government was to scatter this multitude through\r\nthe provinces as coloni, or to draft them into the legions; but the\r\ndetachment detailed to handle them was too feeble, the Goths mutinied,\r\ncut the guard to pieces, and having ravaged Thrace for two years,\r\ndefeated and killed Valens at Hadrianople. In another generation the\r\ndisorganization of the Roman army had become complete, and Alaric gave\r\nit its deathblow in his campaign of 410.\r\n\r\nAlaric was not a Gothic king, but a barbarian deserter, who, in 392,\r\nwas in the service of Theodosius. Subsequently, he sometimes held\r\nimperial commands, and sometimes led bands of marauders on his own\r\naccount, but was always in difficulty about his pay. Finally, in the\r\nrevolution in which Stilicho was murdered, a corps of auxiliaries\r\nmutinied and chose him their general. Alleging that his arrears were\r\nunpaid, Alaric accepted the command, and with this army sacked Rome.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign the attitude of the Christians was more interesting\r\nthan the strategy of the soldiers. Alaric was a robber, leading\r\nmutineers, and yet the orthodox historians did not condemn him. They\r\ndid not condemn him because the sacred class instinctively loved the\r\nbarbarians whom they could overawe, whereas they could make little\r\nimpression on the materialistic intellect of the old centralized\r\nsociety. Under the Empire the priests, like all other individuals, had\r\nto obey the power which paid the police; and as long as a revenue could\r\nbe drawn from the provinces, the Christian hierarchy were subordinate\r\nto the monied bureaucracy who had the means to coerce them.\r\n\r\n   “It was long since established, as a fundamental maxim of the\r\n    Roman constitution, that every rank of citizens were alike\r\n    subject to the laws, and that the care of religion was the\r\n    right as well as duty of the civil magistrate.”[81]\r\n\r\nTheir conversion made little change in the attitude of the emperors,\r\nand Constantine and his successors continued to exercise a supreme\r\njurisdiction over the hierarchy. The sixteenth book of the Theodosian\r\nCode sufficiently sets forth the plenitude of their authority. In\r\ntheory, bishops were elected by the clergy and the people, but in\r\npractice the emperor could control the patronage if it were valuable;\r\nand whether bishops were elected or appointed, as long as they were\r\ncreated and paid by laymen, they were dependent. The priesthood could\r\nonly become autocratic when fear of the miracle exempted them from\r\narrest; and toward the middle of the fifth century this point was\r\napproaching, as appears by the effect of the embassy of Leo the Great\r\nto Attila.\r\n\r\nIn 452 the Huns had crossed the Alps and had sacked Aquileia. The Roman\r\narmy was demoralized; Aëtius could not make head against the barbarians\r\nin the field; while Valentinian was so panic-stricken that he abandoned\r\nRavenna, which was thought impregnable, and retreated to the capital,\r\nwhich was indefensible. At Rome, finding himself helpless in an open\r\ncity, the emperor conceived the idea of invoking the power of the\r\nsupernatural. He proposed to Leo to visit Attila and persuade him to\r\nspare the town. The pope consented without hesitation, and with perfect\r\nintrepidity caused himself to be carried to the Hun’s tent, where he\r\nmet with respect not unalloyed by fear. The legend probably reflects\r\npretty accurately the feeling of the time. As the bishop stood before\r\nthe king, Peter and Paul appeared on either side, menacing Attila\r\nwith flaming swords; and though this particular form of apparition may\r\nbe doubted, Attila seems beyond question to have been oppressed by a\r\nbelief that he would not long survive the capture of Rome. He therefore\r\nreadily agreed to accept a ransom and evacuate Italy.\r\n\r\nFrom the scientific standpoint the saint and the sorcerer are akin;\r\nfor though the saint uses the supernatural for man’s benefit, and\r\nthe sorcerer for his hurt, both deal in magic. The mediæval saint was\r\na powerful necromancer. He healed the sick, cast out devils, raised\r\nthe dead, foretold the future, put out fires, found stolen property,\r\nbrought rain, saved from shipwreck, routed the enemy, cured headache,\r\nwas sovereign in child-birth, and, indeed, could do almost anything\r\nthat was asked of him, whether he were alive or dead. This power was\r\nbelieved to lie in some occult property of the flesh, which passed by\r\ncontact. The woman in the Bible said, “If I may touch but his clothes,\r\nI shall be whole.” Moreover, this fluid was a substance whose passage\r\ncould be felt, for “Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue\r\nhad gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who\r\ntouched my clothes?”[82]\r\n\r\nAnything which came in contact with the saint was likely to have been\r\nimpregnated with this magical quality, and thus became a charm, or\r\nrelic, whose value depended primarily on the power of the man himself,\r\nand secondly, on the thoroughness with which the material had been\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\nThe tomb, which held the whole body, naturally stood highest; then\r\nparts of the body, according to their importance--a head, an arm, a\r\nleg, down to hairs of the beard. Then came hats, boots, girdles, cups,\r\nanything indeed which had been used. The very ground on which a great\r\nmiracle-worker had stood might have high value.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Grail, which had held Christ’s blood, would cure wounds,\r\nraise the dead, and fill itself with choice food, at the command of\r\nthe owner. The eucharist, though not properly a relic, and which only\r\nbecame God through an incantation, would, in expert hands, stop fires,\r\ncure disease, cast out devils, expound philosophy, and detect perjury\r\nby choking the liar.\r\n\r\nEvery prize in life was to be obtained by this kind of magic. When the\r\nkings of France made war, they carried with them the enchanted banner\r\nof Saint Denis, and Froissart has told how even in the reign of Charles\r\nVI. it decided the battle of Roosebeke.[83]\r\n\r\nDisease was treated altogether by miracle, and the Church found\r\nthe business so profitable that she anathematized experimental\r\npractitioners. In the thirteenth century Saint Thomas of Canterbury and\r\nSaint James of Compostello were among the most renowned of healers,\r\nand their shrines blazed with the gifts of the greatest and richest\r\npersons of Europe. When Philip Augustus lay very ill, Louis the Pious\r\nobtained leave to visit the tomb of Saint Thomas, then in the height of\r\nthe fashion, and left as part of his fee the famous regal of France, a\r\njewel so magnificent that three centuries and a half later Henry VIII.\r\nseized it and set it in a thumb ring. Beside this wonderful gem, at\r\nthe pillage of the Reformation, “the king’s receiver confessed that the\r\ngold and silver and precious stones and sacred vestments taken away ...\r\nfilled six-and-twenty carts.”[84] The old books of travel are filled\r\nwith accounts of this marvellous shrine.\r\n\r\n   “But the magnificence of the tomb of Saint Thomas the Martyr,\r\n    Archbishop of Canterbury, is that which surpasses all belief.\r\n    This, notwithstanding its great size, is entirely covered with\r\n    plates of pure gold; but the gold is scarcely visible from the\r\n    variety of precious stones with which it is studded, such as\r\n    sapphires, diamonds, rubies, balas-rubies, and emeralds ...\r\n    and agates, jaspers and cornelians set in relievo, some of the\r\n    cameos being of such a size, that I do not dare to mention it;\r\n    but everything is left far behind by a ruby, not larger than\r\n    a man’s thumb-nail, which is set to the right of the altar....\r\n    They say that it was the gift of a king of France.”[85]\r\n\r\nBut beside these shrines of world-wide reputation, no hamlet was too\r\nremote to possess its local fetish, which worked at cheap rates for the\r\npeasantry. A curious list of these was sent to the Government by two of\r\nCromwell’s visitors in the reign of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe nuns of Saint Mary, at Derby, had part of the shirt of Saint\r\nThomas, reverenced by pregnant women; so was the girdle of Saint\r\nFrancis at Grace Dieu. At Repton, a pilgrimage was made to Saint\r\nGuthlac and his bell, which was put on the head for headache. The\r\nwimple of Saint Audrede was used for sore breasts, and the rod of Aaron\r\nfor children with worms. At Bury Saint Edmund’s, the shrine of Saint\r\nBotulph was carried in procession when rain was needed, “and Kentish\r\nmen ... carry thence ... wax candles, which they light at the end of\r\nthe field while the wheat is sown, and hope from this that neither\r\ntares nor other weeds will grow in the wheat that year.”[86] Most\r\ncurious of all, perhaps, at Pontefract, Thomas, Duke of Lancaster’s\r\nbelt and hat were venerated. They were believed to aid women in\r\nchild-birth, and also to cure headache.\r\n\r\nSaint Thomas Aquinas, a great venerator of the eucharist, used it to\r\nhelp him in his lectures. When treating of the dogma of the Supper at\r\nthe University of Paris, many questions were asked him which he never\r\nanswered without meditating at the foot of the altar. One day, when\r\npreparing an answer to a very difficult question, he placed it on the\r\naltar, and cried, “Lord, who really and veritably dwells in the Holy\r\nSacrament, hear my prayer. If what I have written upon your divine\r\neucharist be true, let it be given me to teach and demonstrate it. If I\r\nam deceived, stop me from proposing doctrines contrary to the truth of\r\nyour divine Sacrament.” Forthwith the Lord appeared upon the altar, and\r\nsaid to him, “You have written well upon the Sacrament of My body, and\r\nyou have answered the question which has been proposed to you as well\r\nas human intelligence can fathom these mysteries.”[87]\r\n\r\nPrimitive people argue directly from themselves to their divinities,\r\nand throughout the Middle Ages men believed that envy, jealousy, and\r\nvanity were as rampant in heaven as on earth, and behaved accordingly.\r\nThe root of the monastic movement was the hope of obtaining advantages\r\nby adulation.\r\n\r\n   “A certain clerk, who had more confidence in the Mother than\r\n    the Son, continually repeated the Ave Maria as his only prayer.\r\n    One day, while so engaged, Christ appeared to him and said, ‘My\r\n    mother thanks you very much for your salutations, ... _tamen et\r\n    me salutare memento_.’”[88]\r\n\r\nTo insure perpetual intercession it was necessary that the song\r\nof praise and the smoke of incense should be perpetual, and\r\ntherefore monks and nuns worked day and night at their calling. As a\r\ntwelfth-century bishop of Metz observed, when wakened one freezing\r\nmorning by the bell of Saint Peter of Bouillon tolling for matins:\r\n“Neither the drowsiness of the night nor the bitterness of a glacial\r\nwinter [kept them] from praising the Creator of the world.”[89]\r\n\r\nBequests to convents were in the nature of policies of insurance in\r\nfavour of the grantor and his heirs, not only against punishment in\r\nthe next world, but against accident in this. On this point doubt is\r\nimpossible, for the belief of the donor is set forth in numberless\r\ncharters. Cedric de Guillac, in a deed to la Grande-Sauve, said that he\r\ngave because “as water extinguishes fire, so gifts extinguish sin.”[90]\r\nAnd an anecdote preserved by Dugdale, shows how valuable an investment\r\nagainst accident a convent was thought to be as late as the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWhen Ralph, Earl of Chester, the founder of the monastery of\r\nDieulacres, was returning by sea from the Holy Land, he was overtaken\r\none night by a sudden tempest. “How long is it till midnight?” he asked\r\nof the sailors. They answered, “About two hours.” He said to them,\r\n“Work on till midnight, and I trust in God that you may have help,\r\nand that the storm will cease.” When it was near midnight the captain\r\nsaid to the earl, “My lord, commend yourself to God, for the tempest\r\nincreases; we are worn out, and are in mortal peril.” Then Earl Ralph\r\ncame out of his cabin, and began to help with the ropes, and the rest\r\nof the ship’s tackle; nor was it long before the storm subsided.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as they were sailing over a tranquil sea, the captain\r\nsaid to the earl, “My lord, tell us, if you please, why you wished us\r\nto work till the middle of the night, and then you worked harder than\r\nall the rest.” To which he replied, “Because at midnight my monks, and\r\nothers, whom my ancestors and I have endowed in divers places, rise\r\nand sing divine service, and then I have faith in their prayers, and\r\nI believe that God, because of their prayers and intercessions, gave\r\nme more fortitude than I had before, and made the storm cease as I\r\npredicted.”[91]\r\n\r\nPhilip Augustus, when caught in a gale in the Straits of Messina,\r\nshowed equal confidence in the matins of Clairvaux, and was also\r\nrewarded for his faith by good weather towards morning.\r\n\r\nThe power of the imagination, when stimulated by the mystery which,\r\nin an age of decentralization, shrouds the operations of nature,\r\ncan be measured by its effect in creating an autocratic class of\r\nmiracle-workers. Between the sixth and the thirteenth centuries, about\r\none-third of the soil of Europe passed into the hands of religious\r\ncorporations, while the bulk of the highest talent of the age sought\r\nits outlet through monastic life.\r\n\r\nThe force operated on all; for, beside religious ecstasy, ambition and\r\nfear were at work, and led to results inconceivable when centralization\r\nhas begot materialism. Saint Bernard’s position was more conspicuous\r\nand splendid than that of any monarch of his generation, and the agony\r\nof terror which assailed the warriors was usually proportionate to the\r\nfreedom with which they had violated ecclesiastical commands. They fled\r\nto the cloister for protection from the fiend, and took their wealth\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nGérard le Blanc was even more noted for his cruelty than for his\r\ncourage. He was returning to his castle one day, after having committed\r\na murder, when he saw the demon whom he served appear to claim him.\r\nSeized with horror, he galloped to where six penitents had just founded\r\nthe convent of Afflighem, and supplicated them to receive him. The news\r\nspread, and the whole province gave thanks to God that a monster of\r\ncruelty should have been so converted.\r\n\r\nA few days after, his example was followed by another knight, equally a\r\nmurderer, who had visited the recluses, and, touched by their piety and\r\nausterity, resolved to renounce his patrimony and live a penitent.[92]\r\n\r\nHad the German migrations been wars of extermination, as they have\r\nsometimes been described, the imagination, among the new barbaric\r\npopulation, might have been so stimulated that a pure theocracy would\r\nhave been developed between the time of Saint Benedict and Saint\r\nBernard. But the barbarians were not animated by hate; on the contrary,\r\nthey readily amalgamated with the old population, amongst whom the\r\nmaterialism of Rome lay like a rock in a rising tide, sometimes\r\nsubmerged, but never obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe obstacle which the true emotionalists never overcame was the\r\ninheritance of a secular clergy, who, down to the eleventh century,\r\nwere generally married, and in the higher grades were rather barons\r\nthan prelates. In France the Archbishop of Rheims, the Bishops of\r\nBeauvais, Noyon, Langres, and others, were counts; while in Germany\r\nthe Archbishops of Mayence, of Treves, and of Cologne were princes\r\nand electors, standing on the same footing as the Dukes of Saxony and\r\nBavaria.\r\n\r\nAs feudal nobles these ecclesiastics were retainers of the king, owed\r\nfeudal service, led their vassals in war, and some of the fiercest\r\nsoldiers of the Middle Ages were clerks. Milo of Treves was a famous\r\neighth-century bishop. Charles Martel gave the archbishopric of Rheims\r\nto a warrior named Milo, who managed also to obtain the see of Treves.\r\nThis Milo was the son of Basinus, the last incumbent of the preferment.\r\nHe was a fierce and irreligious soldier, and was finally killed\r\nhunting; but during the forty years in which he held his offices,\r\nBoniface, with all the aid of the crown and the pope, was unable to\r\nprevail against him, and in 752 Pope Zachary wrote advising that he\r\nshould be left to the divine vengeance.[93]\r\n\r\nSuch a system was incompatible with the supremacy of a theocracy.\r\nThe essence of a theocracy is freedom from secular control, and this\r\ncraving for freedom was the dominant instinct of monasticism. Saint\r\nAnselm, perhaps the most perfect specimen of a monk, felt it in the\r\nmarrow of his bones; it was the master passion of his life, and he\r\ninsisted upon it with all the fire of his nature: “Nihil magis diligit\r\nDeus in hoc mundo quam libertatem ecclesiæ suæ.... Liberam vult esse\r\nDeus sponsam suam, non ancillam.”\r\n\r\nYet only very slowly, as the Empire disintegrated, did the theocratic\r\nidea take shape. As late as the ninth century the pope prostrated\r\nhimself before Charlemagne, and did homage as to a Roman emperor.[94]\r\n\r\nSaint Benedict founded Monte Cassino in 529, but centuries elapsed\r\nbefore the Benedictine order rose to power. The early convents were\r\nisolated and feeble, and much at the mercy of the laity, who invaded\r\nand debauched them. Abbots, like bishops, were often soldiers, who\r\nlived within the walls with their wives and children, their hawks,\r\ntheir hounds, and their men-at-arms; and it has been said that, in all\r\nFrance, Corbie and Fleury alone kept always something of their early\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nOnly in the early years of the most lurid century of the Middle\r\nAges, when decentralization culminated, and the imagination began to\r\ngain its fullest intensity, did the period of monastic consolidation\r\nopen with the foundation of Cluny. In 910 William of Aquitaine drew\r\na charter[95] which, so far as possible, provided for the complete\r\nindependence of his new corporation. There was no episcopal visitation,\r\nand no interference with the election of the abbot. The monks were\r\nput directly under the protection of the pope, who was made their\r\nsole superior. John XI. confirmed this charter by his bull of 932, and\r\nauthorized the affiliation of all convents who wished to share in the\r\nreform.[96]\r\n\r\nThe growth of Cluny was marvellous; by the twelfth century two thousand\r\nhouses obeyed its rule, and its wealth was so great, and its buildings\r\nso vast, that in 1245 Innocent IV., the Emperor Baldwin, and Saint\r\nLouis were all lodged together within its walls, and with them all the\r\nattendant trains of prelates and nobles with their servants.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh century no other force of equal energy existed.\r\nThe monks were the most opulent, the ablest, and the best organized\r\nsociety in Europe, and their effect upon mankind was proportioned\r\nto their strength. They intuitively sought autocratic power, and\r\nduring the centuries when nature favoured them, they passed from\r\ntriumph to triumph. They first seized upon the papacy and made\r\nit self-perpetuating; they then gave battle to the laity for the\r\npossession of the secular hierarchy, which had been under temporal\r\ncontrol since the very foundation of the Church.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1000 Rome was in chaos. The Counts of Tusculum, who\r\nhad often disposed of the tiara, on the death of John XIX., bought it\r\nfor Benedict IX. Benedict was then a child of ten, but he grew worse\r\nas he grew older, and finally he fell so low that he was expelled by\r\nthe people. He was succeeded by Sylvester; but, a few months after his\r\ncoronation, Benedict re-entered the city, and crowned John XX. with\r\nhis own hands. Shortly after, he assaulted the Vatican, and then three\r\npopes reigned together in Rome. In this crisis Gregory VI. tried to\r\nrestore order by buying the papacy for himself; but the transaction\r\nonly added a fourth pope to the three already consecrated, and two\r\nyears later he was set aside by the Emperor Henry, who appointed his\r\nown chancellor in his place.\r\n\r\nIt was a last triumph for the laity, but a triumph easier to win than\r\nto sustain. When the soldier created the high priest of Christendom,\r\nhe did indeed inspire such terror that no man in the great assembly\r\ndared protest; but in nine months Clement was dead, his successor lived\r\nonly twenty-four days, poisoned, as it was rumoured, by the perfidious\r\nItalians; and when Henry sought a third pope among his prelates, he met\r\nwith general timidity to accept the post. Then the opportunity of the\r\nmonks came: they seized it, and with unerring instinct fixed themselves\r\nupon the throne from which they have never been expelled. According to\r\nthe picturesque legend, Bruno, Bishop of Toul, seduced by the flattery\r\nof courtiers and the allurements of ambition, accepted the tiara from\r\nthe emperor, and set out upon his journey to Italy with a splendid\r\nretinue, and with his robe and crown. On his way he turned aside at\r\nCluny, where Hildebrand was prior. Hildebrand, filled with the spirit\r\nof God, reproached him with having seized upon the seat of the vicar\r\nof Christ by force, and accepted the holy office from the sacrilegious\r\nhand of a layman. He exhorted Bruno to cast away his pomp, and to\r\ncross the Alps humbly as a pilgrim, assuring him that the priests\r\nand people of Rome would recognize him as their bishop, and elect him\r\naccording to canonical forms. Then he would taste the joys of a pure\r\nconscience, having entered the fold of Christ as a shepherd and not as\r\na robber. Inspired by these words, Bruno dismissed his train, and left\r\nthe convent gate as a pilgrim. He walked barefoot, and when after two\r\nmonths of pious meditations he stood before Saint Peter’s, he spoke to\r\nthe people and told them it was their privilege to elect the pope, and\r\nsince he had come unwillingly he would return again, were he not their\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nHe was answered with acclamations, and on February 2, 1049, he was\r\nenthroned as Leo IX. His first act was to make Hildebrand his minister.\r\n\r\nThe legend tells of the triumph of Cluny as no historical facts could\r\ndo. Ten years later, in the reign of Nicholas II., the theocracy made\r\nitself self-perpetuating through the assumption of the election of\r\nthe pope by the college of cardinals, and in 1073 Hildebrand, the\r\nincarnation of monasticism, was crowned under the name of Gregory VII.\r\n\r\nWith Hildebrand’s election, war began. The council of Rome, held\r\nin 1075, decreed that holy orders should not be recognized where\r\ninvestiture had been granted by a layman, and that princes guilty of\r\nconferring investiture should be excommunicated. The council of the\r\nnext year, which excommunicated the emperor, also enunciated the famous\r\npropositions of Baronius--the full expression of the theocratic idea:--\r\n\r\n   “That the Roman pontiff alone can be called universal.\r\n\r\n   “That he alone can depose or reconcile bishops.\r\n\r\n   “That his legate, though of inferior rank, takes precedence\r\n    of all bishops in council, and can pronounce sentence of\r\n    deposition against them.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n   “That all princes should kiss the pope’s feet alone.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n   “That he may depose emperors.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n   “That his judgments can be overruled by none, and he alone can\r\n    overrule the judgments of all.\r\n\r\n   “That he can be judged by no one.\r\n\r\n   “That the Roman Church never has, and never can err, as the\r\n    Scriptures testify.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n   “That by his precept and permission it is lawful for subjects\r\n    to accuse their princes.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n   “That he is able to absolve from their allegiance the subjects\r\n    of the wicked.”[97]\r\n\r\nThe monks had won the papacy, but the emperor still held his secular\r\nclergy, and, at the diet of Worms, where he undertook to depose\r\nHildebrand, he was sustained by his prelates. Without a moment of\r\nhesitation the enchanter cast his spell, and it is interesting to\r\nsee, in the curse which he launched at the layman, how the head of\r\nmonasticism had become identified with the spirit which he served. The\r\npriest had grown to be a god on earth.\r\n\r\n   “So strong in this confidence, for the honour and defence\r\n    of your Church, on behalf of the omnipotent God, the Father,\r\n    the Son, and the Holy Ghost, by your power and authority, I\r\n    forbid the government of the German and Italian kingdoms, to\r\n    King Henry, the son of the Emperor Henry, who, with unheard-of\r\n    arrogance, has rebelled against your Church. I absolve all\r\n    Christians from the oaths they have made, or may make to him,\r\n    and I forbid that any one should obey him as king.”[98]\r\n\r\nHenry marched on Italy, but in all European history there has been\r\nno drama more tremendous than the expiation of his sacrilege. To his\r\nsoldiers the world was a vast space, peopled by those fantastic beings\r\nwhich are still seen on Gothic towers. These demons obeyed the monk of\r\nRome, and his army, melting from the emperor under a nameless horror,\r\nleft him helpless.\r\n\r\nGregory lay like a magician in the fortress of Canossa; but he had no\r\nneed of carnal weapons, for when the emperor reached the Alps he was\r\nalmost alone. Then his imagination also took fire, the panic seized\r\nhim, and he sued for mercy.\r\n\r\nFor three days long he stood barefoot in the snow at the castle gate;\r\nand when at last he was admitted, half-naked and benumbed, he was\r\nparalyzed rather by terror than by cold. Then the great miracle was\r\nwrought, by which God was made to publicly judge between them.\r\n\r\nHildebrand took the consecrated wafer and broke it, saying to the\r\nsuppliant, “Man’s judgments are fallible, God’s are infallible; if I\r\nam guilty of the crimes you charge me with, let Him strike me dead as I\r\neat.” He ate, and gave what remained to Henry; but though for him more\r\nthan life was at stake, he dared not taste the bread. From that hour\r\nhis fate was sealed. He underwent his penance and received absolution;\r\nand when he had escaped from the terrible old man, he renewed the war.\r\nBut the spell was over him, the horror clung to him, even his sons\r\nbetrayed him, and at last his mind gave way under the strain and he\r\nabdicated. In his own words, to save his life he “sent to Mayence the\r\ncrown, the sceptre, the cross, the sword, the lance.”\r\n\r\nOn August 7, 1106, Henry died at Liège, an outcast and a mendicant, and\r\nfor five long years his body lay at the church door, an accursed thing\r\nwhich no man dared to bury.\r\n\r\nSuch was the evolution of the mediæval theocracy, the result of that\r\nsocial disintegration which stimulates the human imagination, and\r\nmakes men cower before the unknown. The force which caused the rise\r\nof an independent priesthood was the equivalent of magic, and it was\r\nthe waxing of this force through the dissolution of the Empire of the\r\nWest which made the schism which split Christendom in two. The Latin\r\nChurch divided from the Greek because it was the reflection of the\r\nimaginative mind. While the West grew emotional, Constantinople stayed\r\nthe centre of exchanges, the seat of the monied class; and when Cluny\r\ncaptured Rome, the antagonism between these irreconcilable instincts\r\nprecipitated a rupture. The schism dated from 1054, five years after\r\nthe coronation of Leo. Nor is the theory new; it was explained by\r\nGibbon long ago.\r\n\r\n   “The rising majesty of Rome could no longer brook the insolence\r\n    of a rebel; and Michael Cerularius was excommunicated in the\r\n    heart of Constantinople by the pope’s legates....\r\n\r\n   “From this thunderbolt we may date the consummation of the\r\n    schism. It was enlarged by each ambitious step of the Roman\r\n    pontiffs; the emperors blushed and trembled at the ignominious\r\n    fate of their royal brethren of Germany; and the people were\r\n    scandalized by the temporal power and military life of the\r\n    Latin clergy.”[99]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CRUSADE\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the mechanical arts have advanced far enough to cause the attack\r\nin war to predominate over the defence, centralization cannot begin;\r\nfor when a mud wall can stop an army, a police is impossible. The\r\nsuperiority of the attack was the secret of the power of the monied\r\nclass who controlled Rome, because with money a machine could be\r\nmaintained which made individual resistance out of the question, and\r\nrevolt difficult. Titus had hardly more trouble in reducing Jerusalem,\r\nand dispersing the Jews, than a modern officer would have under similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAs the barbarians overran the Roman provinces, and the arts declined,\r\nthe conditions of life changed. The defence gained steadily on the\r\nattack, and, after some centuries, a town with a good garrison, solid\r\nramparts, and abundant provisions had nothing to fear from the greatest\r\nking. Even the small, square Norman tower was practically impregnable.\r\nAs Viollet-le-Duc has explained, these towers were mere passive\r\ndefences, formidable to a besieger only because no machinery existed\r\nfor making a breach in a wall. The beleaguered nobles had only to watch\r\ntheir own men, see to their doors, throw projectiles at the enemy if he\r\napproached too near, counter-mine if mined, and they might defy a great\r\narmy until their food failed. Famine was the enemy most feared.[100]\r\n\r\nBy the eleventh century these towers had sprung up all over the West.\r\nEven the convents and churches could be defended, and every such\r\nstronghold was the seat of a count or baron, an abbot or bishop, who\r\nwas a sovereign because no one could coerce him, and who therefore\r\nexercised all the rights of sovereignty, made war, dispensed justice,\r\nand coined money. In France alone there were nearly two hundred mints\r\nin the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nDown to the close of the Merovingian dynasty the gold standard had\r\nbeen maintained, and contraction had steadily gone on; but, for reasons\r\nwhich are not understood, under the second race, the purchasing power\r\nof bullion temporarily declined, and this expansion was probably one\r\nchief cause of the prosperity of the reign of Charlemagne. Perhaps the\r\nrelief was due to the gradual restoration of silver to circulation,\r\nfor the coinage was then reformed, and the establishment of the silver\r\npound as the measure of value may be considered as the basis of all the\r\nmonetary systems of modern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe interval of prosperity was, however, brief; no permanent addition\r\nwas made to the stock of precious metals, and prices continued to fall,\r\nas is demonstrated by the rapid deterioration of the currency. In this\r\nsecond period of relapse disintegration reached its limit.\r\n\r\nDuring the tenth and eleventh centuries the Northmen infested the\r\ncoasts of France, and sailed up the rivers burning and ravaging, as\r\nfar as Rouen and Orléans. Even the convents of Saint Martin of Tours\r\nand Saint Germain des Près were sacked. The Mediterranean swarmed with\r\nSaracenic corsairs, who took Fraxinetum, near Toulon, seized the passes\r\nof the Alps, and levied toll on travel into Italy. The cannibalistic\r\nHuns overran the Lower Danube, and closed the road to Constantinople.\r\nWestern Europe was cut off from the rest of the world. Commerce nearly\r\nceased--the roads were so bad and dangerous, and the sea so full of\r\npirates.\r\n\r\nThe ancient stock of scientific knowledge was gradually forgotten, and\r\nthe imagination had full play. Upon philosophy the effect was decisive;\r\nChristianity sank to a plane where it appealed more vividly to the\r\nminds of the surrounding pagans than their own faiths, and conversion\r\nthen went on rapidly. In 912 Rollo of Normandy was baptized; the Danes,\r\nNorwegians, Poles, and Russians followed; and in 997 Saint Stephen\r\nascended the throne of Hungary and reopened to Latin Christians the way\r\nto the Sepulchre.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the destiny of modern Europe has hinged upon the fact that\r\nthe Christian sacred places lay in Asia, and therefore the pilgrimage\r\nbrought the West into contact with the East. But the pilgrimage was\r\nthe effect of relic-worship, and relic-worship the vital principle of\r\nmonasticism. In these centuries of extreme credulity monasticism had\r\nits strongest growth. A faculty for scientific study was abnormal, and\r\nexperimental knowledge was ascribed to sorcery. The monk Gerbert, who\r\nbecame pope as Sylvester II., was probably the most remarkable man of\r\nhis generation. Though poor and of humble birth, he attracted so much\r\nattention that he was sent to Spain, where he studied in the Moorish\r\nschools at Barcelona and Cordova, and where he learned the rudiments of\r\nmathematics and geography. His contemporaries were so bewildered by his\r\nknowledge that they thought it due to magic, and told how he had been\r\nseen flying home from Spain, borne on the back of the demon he served,\r\nand loaded with the books he had stolen from the wizard, his master.\r\nSylvester died in 1003, but long afterwards anatomy was still condemned\r\nby the Church, and four separate councils anathematized experimental\r\nmedicine, because it threatened to destroy the value of the shrines.\r\nThe ascendency of Cluny began with Saint Hugh, who was chosen abbot in\r\n1049, the Year Leo’s election. The corporation then obtained control\r\nof Rome, and in another twenty-five years was engaged in its desperate\r\nstruggle with the remains of the old secular police power. But though\r\nHildebrand crushed Henry, the ancient materialism was too deeply\r\nimbedded to be eradicated in a single generation, and meanwhile the\r\nimagination had been brought to an uncontrollable intensity. A new and\r\nfiercer excitement seethed among the people--a vision of the conquest\r\nof talismans so powerful as to make their owners sure of heaven and\r\nabsolute on earth.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of Palestine had been very early felt, for in 333 a\r\nguide-book had been written, called the _Itinerary from Bordeaux to\r\nJerusalem_, which gave the route through the valley of the Danube,\r\ntogether with an excellent account of the Holy Land. In those\r\ndays, before the barbaric inroads, the journey was safe enough; but\r\nafterwards communication nearly ceased, and when Stephen was baptized\r\nin 997, the relics of Jerusalem had all the excitement of novelty.\r\nEurope glowed with enthusiasm. Sylvester proposed a crusade, and\r\nHildebrand declared he would rather risk his life for the holy places\r\n“than rule the universe.”\r\n\r\nEach year the throngs upon the road increased, convents sprang up along\r\nthe way to shelter the pilgrims, the whole population succoured and\r\nvenerated them, and by the time Cluny had seized the triple crown, they\r\nleft in veritable armies. Ingulf, secretary to William the Conqueror,\r\nset out in 1064 with a band seven thousand strong.\r\n\r\nIn that age of faith no such mighty stimulant could inflame the human\r\nbrain as a march to Jerusalem. A crusade was no vulgar war for a\r\nvulgar prize, but an alliance with the supernatural for the conquest\r\nof talismans whose possession was tantamount to omnipotence. Urban’s\r\nwords at Clermont, when he first preached the holy war, have lost their\r\nmeaning now; but they burned like fire into the hearts of his hearers\r\nthen, for he promised them glory on earth and felicity in heaven, and\r\nhe spoke in substance thus: No longer do you attack a castle or a town,\r\nbut you undertake the conquest of the holy places. If you triumph, the\r\nblessings of heaven and the kingdoms of the East will be your share; if\r\nyou fall, you will have the glory of dying where Christ died, and God\r\nwill not forget having seen you in His holy army.[101]\r\n\r\nUrban told them “that under their general Jesus Christ ... they, the\r\nChristian, the invincible army,” would march to certain victory. In\r\nthe eleventh century this language was no metaphor, for the Cluniac\r\nmonk spoke as the mouthpiece of a god who was there actually among\r\nthem, offering the cross he brought from the grave, and promising them\r\ntriumphs: not the common triumphs which may be won by man’s unaided\r\nstrength, but the transcendent glory which belongs to beings of another\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSo the crusaders rode out to fight, the originals of the fairy knights,\r\nclad in impenetrable armour, mounted on miraculous horses, armed with\r\nresistless swords, and bearing charmed lives.\r\n\r\nWhole villages, even whole districts, were left deserted; land lost its\r\nvalue; what could not be sold was abandoned; and the peasant, loaded\r\nwith his poor possessions, started on foot with his wife and children\r\nin quest of the Sepulchre, so ignorant of the way that he mistook each\r\ntown upon the road for Zion. Whether he would or no, the noble had\r\nto lead his vassals or be forsaken, and riding at their head with his\r\nhawks and hounds, he journeyed towards that marvellous land of wealth\r\nand splendour, where kingdoms waited the coming of the devoted knight\r\nof God. Thus men, women, and children, princes and serfs, priests and\r\nlaymen, in a countless, motley throng, surged toward that mighty cross\r\nand tomb whose possessor was raised above the limitations of the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe crusaders had no commissariat and no supply train, no engines of\r\nattack, or other weapons than those in their hands, and the holy relics\r\nthey bore with them. There was no general, no common language, no\r\norganization; and so over unknown roads, and through hostile peoples,\r\nthey wandered from the Rhine to the Bosphorus, and from the Bosphorus\r\nto Syria.\r\n\r\nThese earlier crusades were armed migrations, not military invasions,\r\nand had they met with a determined enemy, they must have been\r\nannihilated; but it chanced that the Syrians and Egyptians were at\r\nwar, and the quarrel was so bitter that the caliph actually sought the\r\nChristian alliance. Even under such circumstances the waste of life\r\nwas fabulous, and, had not Antioch been betrayed, the starving rabble\r\nmust have perished under its walls. At Jerusalem, also, the Franks were\r\nreduced to the last extremity before they carried the town; and had it\r\nnot been for the arrival of a corps of Genoese engineers, who built\r\nmovable towers, they would have died miserably of hunger and thirst.\r\nNor was the coming of this reinforcement preconcerted. On the contrary,\r\nthe Italians accidentally lost their ships at Joppa, and, being left\r\nwithout shelter, sought protection in the camp of the besiegers just in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSo incapable were the crusaders of regular operations, that even\r\nwhen the towers were finished and armed, the leaders did not know how\r\nto fill the moat, and Raymond of Saint Gilles had nothing better to\r\npropose than to offer a penny for every three stones thrown into the\r\nditch.\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 1099, Jerusalem was stormed; almost exactly three years\r\nafter the march began. Eight days later Godfrey de Bouillon was elected\r\nking, and then the invaders spread out over the strip of mountainous\r\ncountry which borders the coast of Palestine and Syria, and the\r\nchiefs built castles in the defiles of the hills, and bound themselves\r\ntogether by a loose alliance against the common enemy.\r\n\r\nThe decentralization of the colony was almost incredible. The core of\r\nthe kingdom was the barony of Jerusalem, which extended only from the\r\nEgyptian desert to a stream just north of Beyrout, and inland to the\r\nJordan and the spurs of the hills beyond the Dead Sea, and yet it was\r\ndivided into more than eighteen independent fiefs, whose lords had all\r\nthe rights of sovereignty, made war, administered justice, and coined\r\nmoney.[102]\r\n\r\nBeside these petty states, the ports were ceded to the Italian cities\r\nwhose fleets helped in the conquest. Venice, Genoa, and Pisa held\r\nquarters in Ascalon, Joppa, Tyre, Acre, and Beyrout, which were\r\ngoverned by consuls or viscounts, who wrangled with each other and with\r\nthe central government.\r\n\r\nSuch was the kingdom over which Godfrey reigned, but there were three\r\nothers like it which together made up the Frankish monarchy. To the\r\nnorth of the barony of Jerusalem lay the county of Tripoli, and beyond\r\nTripoli, extending to Armenia, the principality of Antioch. To the east\r\nof Antioch the county of Edessa stretched along the base of the Taurus\r\nMountains and spread out somewhat indefinitely beyond the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nThus on the north Edessa was the outwork of Christendom, while to the\r\nsouth the castle of Karak, which commanded the caravan road between\r\nSuez and Damascus, held a corresponding position among the hills to the\r\neast of the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nBeyond the mountains the great plain sweeps away into Central Asia,\r\nand in this plain the Franks never could maintain their footing. Their\r\nfailure to do so proved their ruin, for their position lay exposed to\r\nattack from Damascus; and it was by operating from Damascus as a base\r\nthat Saladin succeeded in forcing the pass of Banias, and in cutting\r\nthe Latin possessions in two at the battle of Tiberias.\r\n\r\nA considerable body of Europeans were thus driven in like a wedge\r\nbetween Egypt and the Greek Empire, the two highest civilizations of\r\nthe Middle Ages, while in front lay the Syrian cities of the plain,\r\nwith whom the Christians were at permanent war. The contact was the\r\nclosest, the struggle for existence the sharpest, and the barbaric mind\r\nreceived a stimulus not unlike the impulse Gaul received from Rome; for\r\nthe interval which separated the East from the West, at the beginning\r\nof the twelfth century, was probably not less than that which divided\r\nItaly from Gaul at the time of Cæsar.\r\n\r\nWhen Godfrey de Bouillon took the cross, the Byzantine Empire was\r\nalready sinking. The Eastern trade which, for so many centuries, had\r\nnourished its population, was beginning to flow directly from Asia\r\ninto Italy, and, as the economic aristocracy of the capital lost its\r\nnutriment, it lost its energy. Apparently it fell in 1081, in the\r\nrevolution which raised Alexius Comuenus to the throne. Because Alexius\r\nsacked Constantinople with a following of mongrel Greeks, Slavs, and\r\nBulgarians, he has been called the first Greek emperor, but in reality\r\nthe pure Greek blood had long since perished. The Byzantine population\r\nat the end of the eleventh century was the lees of a multitude of\r\nraces,--a mixture of Slavs, Armenians, Jews, Thracians, and Greeks;\r\na residuum of the most tenacious organisms, after all that was higher\r\nhad disappeared. The army was a mixed horde of Huns, Arabs, Italians,\r\nBritons, Franks; of all in short who could fight and were for sale,\r\nwhile the Church was servile, the fancy dead, and art and literature\r\nwere redolent of decaying wealth.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, ever since the fall of Rome, Constantinople had been the\r\nreservoir whence the West had drawn all its materialistic knowledge,\r\nand therefore, it was during the centuries when the valley of the\r\nDanube was closed, that the arts fell to their lowest ebb beyond the\r\nAlps and Rhine. After pilgrimages began again in the reign of Stephen,\r\nthe Bosphorus lay once more in the path of travel, and as the returning\r\npalmers spread over the West, a revival followed in their track; a\r\nrevival in which the spirit of Byzantium may yet be clearly read in the\r\narchitecture of Italy and France. Saint Mark is a feeble imitation of\r\nSaint Sophia, while Viollet-le-Duc has described how long he hesitated\r\nbefore he could decide whether the carving of Vézelay, Autun, and\r\nMoissac was Greek or French; and has dwelt upon the laborious care with\r\nwhich he pored over all the material, before he became convinced that\r\nthe stones were cut by artists trained at Cluny, who copied Byzantine\r\nmodels.[103]\r\n\r\nBut the great gulf between the economic and the imaginative\r\ndevelopment, separated the moribund Greek society from the\r\nsemi-childhood of the Franks; a chasm in its nature impassable because\r\ncaused by a difference of mind, and which is, perhaps, seen most\r\nstrikingly in religious architecture; for religious architecture,\r\nthough always embodying the highest poetical aspirations of every\r\ncivilization, yet had in the East and West diametrically opposite\r\npoints of departure.\r\n\r\nSaint Sophia is pregnant with the spirit of the age of Justinian. There\r\nwas no attempt at mystery, or even solemnity, about the church, for the\r\nmind of the architect was evidently fixed upon solving the problem of\r\nproviding the largest and lightest space possible, in which to display\r\nthe functions of a plutocratic court. His solution was brilliantly\r\nsuccessful. He enlarged the dome and diminished the supports, until,\r\nnothing remaining to interrupt the view, it seemed as though the roof\r\nhad been suspended in the air. For his purpose the exterior had little\r\nvalue, and he sacrificed it.\r\n\r\nThe conception of the architects of France was the converse of this,\r\nfor it was highly emotional. The gloom of the lofty vaults, dimly\r\nlighted by the subdued splendour of the coloured windows, made the\r\ninterior of the Gothic cathedral the most mysterious and exciting\r\nsanctuary for the celebration of the miracle which has ever been\r\nconceived by man; while without, the doors and windows, the pinnacles\r\nand buttresses, were covered with the terrific shapes of demons and the\r\nmajestic figures of saints, admonishing the laity of the danger lurking\r\nabroad, and warning them to take refuge within.\r\n\r\nBut if the Greeks and the Franks had little affinity for each other,\r\nthe case was different with the Saracens, who were then in the full\r\nvigour of their intellectual prime, and in the meridian of their\r\nmaterial splendour.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh century, when Paris was still a cluster of huts\r\ncowering for shelter on the islands of the Seine, and the palace of\r\nthe Duke of Normandy and King of England was the paltry White Tower of\r\nLondon, Cairo was being adorned with those masterpieces which are still\r\nthe admiration of the world.\r\n\r\nPrisse d’Avennes considered that, among the city gates the Bab-el-Nasr\r\nstands first in “taste and style,” and the famous Bab-el-Zouilyeh is\r\nof the same period. He also thought the mosque of Teyloun a “model of\r\nelegance and grandeur,” and observed, when criticising the mosque of\r\nthe Sultan Hassan, built in 1356, that though imposing and beautiful,\r\nit lacks the unity which is only found in the earlier Arabic monuments,\r\nsuch as Teyloun.[104] Indeed, the signs are but too apparent that, from\r\nthe twelfth century, the instinct for form began to fail in Egypt, the\r\nsurest precursor of artistic decay.\r\n\r\nThe magnificence of the decoration and furnishing of the Arabic palaces\r\nand houses has seldom been surpassed, and a few extracts from an\r\ninventory of a sale of the collections of the Caliph Mostanser-Billah,\r\nheld in 1050, may give some idea of its gorgeousness.\r\n\r\n    _Precious Stones._--A chest containing 7 _Mudds_ of emeralds;\r\n    each of these worth at least 300,000 dynars, which makes in all\r\n    at the lowest estimation, 36,000,000 francs.\r\n\r\n    A necklace of precious stones worth about 80,000 dynars.\r\n\r\n    Seven _Waïbah_ of magnificent pearls sent by the Emir of Mecca.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n    _Glass._--Several chests, containing a large number of vases ...\r\n    of the purest crystal, chased and plain.\r\n\r\n    Other chests filled with precious vases of different materials.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n    _Table Utensils._--A large number of gold dishes, enamelled or\r\n    plain, in which were incrusted all sorts of colours, forming\r\n    most varied designs.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n    One hundred cups and other shapes, of bezoar-stone, on most of\r\n    which was engraved the name of the Caliph Haroun-el-Raschid.\r\n\r\n    Another cup which was 3 1⁄2 hands wide and one deep.\r\n\r\n    _Different Articles._--Chests containing inkstands of different\r\n    shapes, round or square, small or large, of gold or silver,\r\n    sandal wood, aloe, ebony, ivory, and all kinds of woods,\r\n    enriched with stones, gold and silver, or remarkable for beauty\r\n    and elegance of workmanship.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n    Twenty-eight enamel dishes inlaid with gold, which the Caliph\r\n    Aziz had received as a present from the Greek emperor and each\r\n    of which was valued at 3000 dynars.\r\n\r\n    Chests filled with an enormous quantity of steel, china, and\r\n    glass mirrors, ornamented with gold and silver filagree; some\r\n    were bordered with stones, and had cornelian handles, and\r\n    others precious stones. One of them had quite a long and thick\r\n    handle of emeralds. These mirrors were enclosed in cases made\r\n    of velvet or silk or most beautiful wood; their locks were of\r\n    gold or silver.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n    Four hundred large cases, ornamented with gold and filled with\r\n    all sorts of jewels.\r\n\r\n    Various silver household goods, and six thousand gold vases, in\r\n    which were put narcissus or violets.\r\n\r\n    Thirty-six thousand pieces of crystal, among them a box\r\n    ornamented with figures in relief, weighing 17 roks.\r\n\r\n    A large number of knives which, at the lowest price, were sold\r\n    for 36,000 dynars.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n    A turban enriched with precious stones, one of the most curious\r\n    and valuable articles in the palace: it was said to be worth\r\n    130,000 dynars. The stones which covered it, and whose weight\r\n    was 17 roks, were divided between two chiefs, who both claimed\r\n    it. One had in his share a ruby weighing 23 mitqâls, and in the\r\n    share which fell to the other were 100 pearls each of which\r\n    weighed 3 mitqâls. When the two generals were obliged to fly\r\n    from Fostat, all these valuables were given up to pillage.\r\n\r\n    A golden peacock enriched with the most valuable precious\r\n    stones: the eyes were rubies, the feathers gilded enamel\r\n    representing all the colours of peacock feathers.\r\n\r\n    A cock of the same metal, with a comb of the largest rubies\r\n    covered with pearls and other stones; the eyes also were made\r\n    of rubies.\r\n\r\n    A gazelle whose body was covered all over with pearls and the\r\n    most precious stones; the stomach was white and composed of a\r\n    series of pearls of the purest water.\r\n\r\n    A sardonyx table, with conical feet of the same substance; it\r\n    was large enough for several people to eat there at the same\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n    A garden, the soil made of chased and gilt silver and yellow\r\n    earth. There were silver trees, with fruits made of precious\r\n    materials.\r\n\r\n    A golden palm-tree enriched with superb pearls. It was in\r\n    a golden chest and its fruit was made of precious stones\r\n    representing dates in every stage of ripeness. This tree was of\r\n    inestimable value.[105]\r\n\r\nAbout the time the monk Gerbert was accused of sorcery because he\r\nunderstood the elements of geometry, the Caliph Aziz-Billah founded the\r\nuniversity of Cairo, the greatest Mohammedan institution of learning.\r\nThis was two hundred years before the organization of the university\r\nof Paris, and the lectures at the mosque of El-Azhar are said to have\r\nbeen attended by twelve thousand students. Munk was of opinion that\r\nArabic philosophy reached its apogee with Averrhoës, who was born about\r\n1120.[106] Certainly he was the last of a famous line which began at\r\nBagdad three centuries earlier; and Hauréau, in describing the great\r\nperiod of Saint Thomas at Paris, dwelt upon the debt Western learning\r\nowed to the Saracens.\r\n\r\nThe splendour of Haroun-al-Raschid is still proverbial. The tales of\r\nhis gold and silver, his silks and gems, almost surpass belief, and\r\neven in his reign the mechanical arts were so advanced that he sent a\r\nclock to Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nHumboldt considered the Arabs as the founders of modern experimental\r\nscience, and they were relatively skilful chemists, for they understood\r\nthe composition of sulphuric and nitric acid, and of aqua regia,\r\nbeside the preparation of mercury and of various oxides of metals. As\r\nphysicians they were far in advance of Europe. While the Church healed\r\nby miracles, and put experimental methods under her ban, the famous\r\nRhazes conducted the hospitals of Bagdad, and in the tenth century\r\nwrote a work in ten books, which was printed at Venice as late as 15\r\n10. Practitioners of all nations have used his treatise on small-pox\r\nand measles; he introduced mild purgatives, invented the seton, and was\r\na remarkable anatomist. He died in 932.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Tyre stated that the Frankish nobles of Syria preferred\r\nthe native or Jewish doctors; and though Saladin sent his physician to\r\nRichard, Richard never thought of sending an Englishman to Saladin when\r\nafterwards attacked by illness.\r\n\r\nEven as late as the middle of the thirteenth century little advance\r\nseems to have been made in Europe, for one of the most curious\r\nphenomena of the crusades was the improvement in the health of the\r\narmy of Saint Louis after it surrendered. During the campaign various\r\nepidemics had been very fatal; but when the soldiers were subjected\r\nto the sanitary regulations of the Egyptian medical staff, disease\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs had a strong taste for mathematics, and were familiar with\r\nmost of the discoveries which have been attributed to astronomers of\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1000 spherical trigonometry was in use, and Aboul-Hassan\r\nwrote an excellent treatise on conic sections. In 833 the Caliph\r\nEl-Mamoun, having founded observatories at Bagdad and Damascus, caused\r\na degree to be measured on the plain of Palmyra. By the thirteenth\r\ncentury the Arabic instruments were comparatively perfect. They had\r\nthe astrolabe, the gnomon, the sextant, and the mariner’s compass,\r\nand Aboul-Wafa determined the third lunar variation six hundred years\r\nbefore Tycho Brahe.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all the improvements in agriculture and manufactures which\r\ncame from the mediæval pilgrimage would take a separate treatise. A\r\nFrench savant thought of writing a book upon the flora of the crusades\r\nalone. The mulberry and the silkworm were brought from Greece, the\r\nmaize from Turkey, the plum from Damascus, the eschalot from Ascalon,\r\nand the windmills with which, down to the present century, corn was\r\nground, were one of the importations from the Levant.\r\n\r\nIt might almost be said that all the West knew of the arts was learned\r\non the road to the sepulchre. The Tyrians taught the Sicilians to\r\nrefine sugar, and the Venetians to make glass; Damascus steel was a\r\nproverb, Damascus potters were the masters of the potters of France;\r\nthe silk, brocades, and carpets of Syria and Persia were in the twelfth\r\ncentury what they have been down to the present day, at once the\r\nadmiration and despair of Western weavers, while there can be little\r\ndoubt that gunpowder was the invention of the chemists of the East.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence tends to prove that the ogive came from the\r\nLevant, and without the ogive Gothic architecture could never have\r\ndeveloped.[107] Prior to the council of Clermont the pointed arch was\r\npractically unknown west of the Adriatic; but the Arabs had long used\r\nit, and it may still be seen in the ninth century mosque of Teyloun.\r\n\r\nIn Palestine the Franks were surrounded by Saracenic buildings, and\r\nemployed Saracenic masons, and the attention of Western architects\r\nseems no sooner to have been drawn to the possibilities of the ogive,\r\nthan they saw in it the solution of those problems which had before\r\ndefied them. An arch formed by two intersecting segments of a circle\r\ncould be raised to any height from any base, and was perfectly adapted\r\nto vaulting the parallelograms formed by the columns of the nave.\r\nTherefore, contemporaneously with the building of the church of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, the period of transition between the Romanesque and the\r\nGothic opened in France. The two most important transition buildings\r\nwere the abbey of Saint Denis and the cathedral of Noyon, and, while\r\nthe Holy Sepulchre was dedicated in 1149, the abbey was completed in\r\n1144, and the cathedral was begun almost immediately after.[108]\r\n\r\nThenceforward the movement was rapid, and before the year 1200,\r\nChristian sacred architecture was culminating in those marvels of\r\nbeauty, the cathedrals of Paris, of Bourges, of Chartres, and of Le\r\nAlans. Yet, though sacred architecture tells the story of the rise of\r\nthe imagination as nothing else can, if it be true that centralization\r\nhinges on the preponderance of the attack in war, the surest way of\r\nmeasuring the advance toward civilization of rude peoples must be by\r\nmilitary engineering.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh century, north of the Alps, this science was\r\nrudimentary, and nothing can be more impressive than to compare the\r\nmighty ramparts of Constantinople with the small square tower which\r\nWilliam the Conqueror found ample for his needs in London.\r\n\r\nWhen the crusaders were first confronted with the Greek and Arabic\r\nworks, they were helpless; nor were their difficulties altogether those\r\nof ignorance. Such fortifications were excessively costly, and a feudal\r\nState was poor because the central power had not the force to constrain\r\nindividuals to pay taxes. The kingdom of Jerusalem was in chronic\r\ninsolvency.\r\n\r\nThe life of the Latin colony in Syria, therefore, hung on the\r\ndevelopment of some financial system which should make the\r\nfortification of Palestine possible, and such a system grew up through\r\nthe operation of the imagination, though in an unusual manner.\r\n\r\nFetish worship drew a very large annual contribution from the\r\npopulation in the shape of presents to propitiate the saints, and\r\none of the effects of the enthusiasm for the crusades was to build up\r\nconventual societies in the Holy Land, which acted as standing armies.\r\nThe most famous of the military orders were the Knights of the Temple\r\nand the Knights of Saint John. William of Tyre has left an interesting\r\ndescription of the way in which the Temple came to be organized:--\r\n\r\n   “As though the Lord God sends his grace there where he\r\n    pleases, worthy knights, who were of the land beyond the sea,\r\n    proposed to stay for ever in the service of Our Lord, and\r\n    to live in common, like regular canons. In the hand of the\r\n    patriarch they vowed chastity and obedience, and renounced all\r\n    property.... The king and the other barons, the patriarch and\r\n    other prelates of the Church, gave them funds to live on and\r\n    to clothe themselves.... The first thing which was enjoined\r\n    on them in pardon for their sins was to guard the roads by\r\n    which the pilgrims passed, from robbers and thieves, who did\r\n    great harm. This penance the patriarch and the other bishops\r\n    enjoined. Nine years they remained thus in secular habit,\r\n    wearing such garments as were given them by the knights and\r\n    other good people, for the love of God. In the ninth a council\r\n    was assembled in France in the city of Troyes. There were\r\n    assembled the archbishops of Rheims and Sens and all their\r\n    bishops. The bishop of Albano especially was there as papal\r\n    legate, the abbots of Citeau and Clairvaux, and many other of\r\n    the religious.\r\n\r\n   “There were established the order and the rules by which they\r\n    were to live as monks. Their habit was ordered to be white, by\r\n    the authority of Pope Honorius and the patriarch of Jerusalem.\r\n    This order had already existed nine years, as I have told\r\n    you, and there were as yet only nine brothers, who lived from\r\n    day to day on charity. From that time their numbers began to\r\n    increase, and revenues and tenures were given them. In the time\r\n    of Pope Etigenius it was ordered that they should have sewn\r\n    upon their copes and on their robes a cross of red cloth, so\r\n    that they should be known among all men.... From thence have\r\n    their possessions so increased as you can see, that the order\r\n    of the Temple is in the ascendant.... Hardly can you find on\r\n    either side of the sea a Christian land where this order has\r\n    not to-day houses and brethren, and great revenues.”[109]\r\n\r\nThe council of Troyes was held in 1128, and in the next fifty years,\r\nin proportion as the feudal organization of the Latin kingdom decayed,\r\nthe military orders increased in wealth and power. The Hospital held\r\nnineteen thousand manors in Europe, the Temple nine thousand, and each\r\nmanor could maintain a knight in the field.\r\n\r\nAt Paris the house of the Temple filled a whole quarter; its donjon was\r\none of the most superb buildings of the Middle Ages; at a later period,\r\nwhen the corporation took to banking, it served as a place of deposit\r\nfor both public and private treasure, and in times of danger the king\r\nhimself was glad to take shelter within its walls.\r\n\r\nThe creation of this monastic standing army was evidently due to the\r\ninferiority of the attack to the defence, which made the civil power\r\nincapable of coercing the individual who refused to pay taxes. The\r\npetty barons who built the castles throughout Palestine were too poor\r\nto erect fortifications capable of resisting the superior engines used\r\nin the East. Therefore the whole burden of the war was thrown upon the\r\nChurch, and in all modern history nothing is more wonderful than the\r\nway in which this work was done.\r\n\r\nWithin fifty years after the conquest the feudal machinery was in\r\nruin, and the strategic points, one after another, passed into the\r\nhands of the strongest force of the age, the force which was incarnate\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nThe fortresses built by the monks were the ramparts of Christendom,\r\nand among the remains which have survived the past, perhaps none are\r\nmore impressive than the huge castles of the crusaders in the gorges\r\nof the Syrian mountains; nor do any show so clearly whence came the\r\nrationalistic stimulus which revolutionized Europe, shattered the\r\nChurch, and brought in the economic society which has ruled Europe\r\nsince the Templars passed away.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles due west of Homs, at the point where the Lebanon\r\nmelts into the Ansarieh range, the mountains open, and two passes\r\nlead by easy descents to the sea. Through the southern runs the road\r\nto Tripoli, through the northern that to Tortosa. Between them, on a\r\ncrag a thousand feet above the valleys, still stands the castle of the\r\nKrak des Chevaliers, ceded by Count Raymond of Tripoli to the Hospital\r\nin 1145. Towering above the plain it can be seen for miles, and no\r\ndescription can give an idea of its gigantic size and power. Coucy and\r\nPierrefonds are among the largest fortresses of Europe, and yet Coucy\r\nand Pierrefonds combined are no larger than the Krak.\r\n\r\nCompared with it, the works then built in the West were toys, and\r\nthe engineering talent shown in its conception was equalled by the\r\nmagnificence of its masonry. The Byzantine system was adopted. A double\r\nwall, the inner commanding the outer, with a moat between; and three\r\nenormous towers rising from the moat, formed the donjon. There were\r\nstone machicoulis and all the refinements of defence which appeared in\r\nFrance under Saint Louis and his son, and a study of this stupendous\r\nmonument shows plainly whence Europeans drew their military instruction\r\nfor a century to come.\r\n\r\nThe Krak was the outwork dominating the plain where the Christians\r\nnever made their footing good, and stood at the apex of a triangle\r\nof fortresses as remarkable as itself. From its ramparts the great\r\nwhite tower of Chastel-Blanc can be seen, midway between the outpost\r\ncommanding the mountain passes and the base upon the sea held by the\r\nTemple; and from that tower the troop of Templars rode to relieve\r\nthe knights of Saint John, on the day when the crusaders routed the\r\nconqueror Nour-ed-Din, and cut his army to pieces as it fled toward the\r\nLake of Homs, which lies in the distance.\r\n\r\nBut the white tower is unlike the donjons of other lands, and bears the\r\nimprint of the force which built it, for it is not a layman’s hold, but\r\na church, whose windows are cut in walls thirteen feet thick, whence\r\nthe dim light falls across the altar where the magicians wrought their\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\nWithin easy supporting distance lay Tortosa, a walled town, the outwork\r\nof a donjon at least as strong as the Krak, and built with a perfection\r\nof workmanship, and a beauty of masonry, which proves at once the\r\nknowledge and the resources of the order. No monarch of the West could,\r\nprobably, at that time have undertaken so costly an enterprise, and\r\nyet Tortosa was but one of four vast structures which lie within a few\r\nmiles of each other. The place was ceded to the Temple in 1183, just\r\nat the beginning of the reign of Philip Augustus, before men dreamed of\r\nthe more important French fortifications.\r\n\r\nAt Margat, a day’s journey to the north, the Hospital had their\r\nbase upon the sea: a stronghold whose cost must have been fabulous,\r\nfor it is perched upon a crag high above the Mediterranean, and so\r\ninaccessible that it is not easy to understand how the materials for\r\nbuilding were collected. Viollet-le-Duc, who was lost in admiration at\r\nCoucy, declared that it was colossal enough to befit a race of giants,\r\nand yet Coucy could have stood in the courtyard of Margat.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, who were excellent engineers, deemed it a masterpiece, and\r\nthe Sultan Kalaoun could not endure the thought of injuring it. After\r\nhe had mined the great tower and was sure of victory, he proved to the\r\ngarrison his power to destroy it, in order to induce them to accept\r\nmost liberal terms of surrender, and let him have the prize. Perhaps\r\nthe best description ever given of the work is in a letter written by\r\nthe Sultan of Hamah to his vizier to announce its fall:\r\n\r\n   “The devil himself had taken pleasure in consolidating its\r\n    foundations. How many times have the Mussulmans tried to reach\r\n    its towers and fallen down the precipices! Markab is unique,\r\n    perched on the summit of a rock. It is accessible to relief,\r\n    and inaccessible to attack. The eagle and the vulture alone can\r\n    fly to its ramparts.”[110]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND CRUSADE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the East was richer than the West, the Saracens were capable of a\r\nhigher centralization than the Franks, and although they were divided\r\namongst themselves at the close of the eleventh century, no long time\r\nelapsed after the fall of Jerusalem before the consolidation began\r\nwhich annihilated the Latin kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan of Persia made Zenghi governor of Mosul in 1127. Zenghi,\r\nwho was the first Atabek, was a commander and organizer of ability,\r\nand with a soldier’s instinct struck where his enemy was vulnerable. He\r\nfirst occupied Aleppo, Hamah, and Homs. He then achieved the triumph of\r\nhis life by the capture of Edessa. The next year he was murdered, and\r\nwas succeeded by his still more celebrated son, Nour-ed-Din, who made\r\nAleppo his capital, and devoted his life to completing the work his\r\nfather had begun.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of brilliant campaigns, by a mixture of vigour and\r\naddress, Nour-ed-Din made himself master of Damascus, and, operating\r\nthence as a base, he conquered Egypt, and occupied Cairo in 1169.\r\nDuring the Egyptian war, a young emir, named Saladin, rose rapidly into\r\nprominence. He was the nephew of the general in command, at whose death\r\nthe caliph made him vizier, because he thought him pliable. In this the\r\ncaliph was mistaken, for Saladin was a man of iron will and consummate\r\nability. William of Tyre even accused him of having murdered the last\r\nFatimite caliph with his own hands in order to cause the succession to\r\npass to Nour-ed-Din, and to seize on the substance of power himself, as\r\nNour-ed-Din’s representative.\r\n\r\nCertainly he administered Egypt in his own interest, and not in\r\nhis master’s; so much so that Nour-ed-Din, having failed to obtain\r\nobedience to his commands, had prepared to march against him in person,\r\nwhen, on the eve of his departure, he died. Saladin then moved on\r\nDamascus, and having defeated the army of El Melek, the heir to the\r\ncrown, at Hamah, he had himself declared Sultan of Egypt and Syria.\r\n\r\nWith a power so centralized the Franks would probably, under the best\r\ncircumstances, have been unable to cope. The weakness of the Christians\r\nwas radical, and arose from the exuberance of their imagination, which\r\ncaused them to proceed by miracles, or more correctly, by magical\r\nformulas. An exalted imagination was the basis of the characters of\r\nboth Louis VII. and Saint Bernard, and the faith resulting therefrom\r\nled to the defeat of the second crusade.\r\n\r\nThe Christian collapse began with the fall of Edessa, for the County of\r\nEdessa was the extreme northeastern state of the Latin community, and\r\nthe key to the cities of the plain. When the first crusaders reached\r\nArmenia, Baldwin, brother of Godfrey de Bouillon, conceived the idea of\r\ncarving a kingdom for himself out of the Christian country to the south\r\nof the Taurus range. Taking with him such pilgrims as he could persuade\r\nto go, he started from Mamistra, just north of the modern Alexandretta,\r\nand marched east along the caravan road. Edessa lay sixteen hours’ ride\r\nbeyond the Euphrates, and he reached it in safety.\r\n\r\nAt this time, though Edessa still nominally formed part of the Greek\r\nEmpire, it was in reality independent, and was governed by an old man\r\nnamed Theodore, who had originally been sent from Constantinople, but\r\nwho had gradually taken the position of a sovereign. The surrounding\r\ncountry had been overrun by Moslems, and Theodore only maintained\r\nhimself by paying tribute. The people, therefore, were ready to welcome\r\nany Frankish baron capable of defending them; and Baldwin, though a\r\nneedy adventurer, was an excellent officer, and well adapted to the\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near, the townsmen went out to meet him, and escorted him to\r\nthe city in triumph, where he soon supplanted the old Theodore, whom\r\nhe probably murdered. He then became Count of Edessa, but he remained\r\nin the country only two years, for in 1100 he was elected to succeed\r\nhis brother Godfrey. He was followed as Lord of Edessa by his cousin\r\nGodfrey de Bourg, who, in his turn, was crowned King of Jerusalem in\r\n1119, and the next count was de Bourg’s cousin, Joscelin de Courtney,\r\nwho had previously held as a fief the territory to the west of the\r\nEuphrates. This Joscelin was one of the most renowned warriors who ever\r\ncame from France, and while he lived the frontier was well defended. So\r\nhigh was his prowess that he earned the title of “the great,” in an age\r\nwhen every man was a soldier, and in a country where arms were the only\r\npath to fortune save the Church.\r\n\r\nThe story of his death is one of the most dramatic of that dramatic\r\ntime. As he stood beneath the wall of a Saracenic tower he had mined,\r\nit suddenly fell and buried him in the ruins. He was taken out a\r\nmangled mass to die, but, as he lay languishing, news came that the\r\nSultan of Iconium had laid siege to one of his castles near Tripoli.\r\nFeeling that he could not sit his horse, he called his son and directed\r\nhim to collect his vassals and ride to the relief of the fortress. The\r\nyouth hesitated, fearing that the enemy were too numerous. Then the\r\nold man, grieving to think of the fate of his people when he should\r\nbe gone, had himself slung in a litter between two horses, and marched\r\nagainst the foe.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far before he was met by a messenger, who told him\r\nthat when the Saracens heard the Lord of Courtney was upon the march,\r\nthey had raised the siege and fled. Then the wounded baron ordered his\r\nlitter to be set down upon the ground, and, stretching out his hands to\r\nheaven, he thanked God who had so honoured him that his enemies dared\r\nnot abide his coming even when in the jaws of death, and died there\r\nwhere he lay.\r\n\r\nThe second generation of Franks seems to have deteriorated through the\r\ninfluence of the climate, but the character of the younger Joscelin\r\nwas not the sole cause of the disasters which overtook him. Probably\r\neven his father could not permanently have made head against the forces\r\nwhich were combining against him. The weakness of the Frankish kingdom\r\nwas inherent: it could not contend with enemies who were further\r\nadvanced upon the road toward consolidation. Had Western society been\r\nenough centralized to have organized a force capable of collecting\r\ntaxes, and of enforcing obedience to a central administration, a\r\nwage-earning army might have been maintained on the frontier. As\r\nit was, concentration was impossible, and the scattered nobles were\r\ncrushed in detail.\r\n\r\nAntioch was the nearest supporting point to Edessa, and, when Zenghi\r\nmade his attack, Raymond de Poitiers, one of the ablest soldiers of\r\nhis generation, was the reigning prince. But he was at feud with the\r\nCourtneys; the king at Jerusalem could not force him to do his duty;\r\nthe other barons were too distant, even had they been well disposed;\r\nand thus the key to the Christian position fell without a blow being\r\nstruck in its defence.\r\n\r\nTo that emotional generation the loss of Edessa seemed a reversal of\r\nthe laws of nature; a consequence not of bad organization but of divine\r\nwrath. The invincible relics had suddenly refused to act, and the only\r\nexplanation which occurred to the men of the time was, that there must\r\nhave been neglect of the magical formulas.\r\n\r\nSaint Bernard never doubted that God would fight if duly propitiated;\r\ntherefore all else must bend to the task of propitiation: “What think\r\nye, brethren? Is the hand of the Lord weakened, or unequal to the work\r\nof defence, that he calls miserable worms to guard and restore his\r\nheritage? Is he not able to send more than twelve legions of angels,\r\nor, to speak truly, by word deliver his country?”[111]\r\n\r\nSaint Bernard of Clairvaux, the soul of the second crusade, was born\r\nat the castle of Fontaines, near Dijon, in 1091, so that his earliest\r\nimpressions must have been tinged by the emotional outburst which\r\nfollowed the council of Clermont. The third son of noble parents, he\r\nresembled his mother, who had the ecstatic temperament. While she lived\r\nshe tried to imitate the nuns, and at her death she was surrounded\r\nby holy clerks, who sung with her while she could speak, and, when\r\narticulation failed, watched her lips moving in praise to God.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Bernard craved a monastic life, and when he grew\r\nup insisted on dedicating himself to Heaven. His first success was\r\nthe conversion of his brothers, whom he carried with him to the\r\ncloister, with the exception of the youngest, who was then a child.\r\nAs the brothers passed through the castle courtyard, on their way to\r\nthe convent, Guy, the eldest, said to the boy, who was playing there\r\nwith other children, “Well, Nivard, all our land is now yours.” “So\r\nyou will have heaven and I earth,” the child answered; “that is an\r\nunequal division.” And a few years after he joined his brothers.[112]\r\nThe father and one daughter then were left alone, and at last they too\r\nentered convents, where they died.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-two, when Bernard took his vows at Citeaux, his influence was\r\nso strong that he carried with him thirty of his comrades, and mothers\r\nare said to have hid their sons from him, and wives their husbands,\r\nlest he should lure them away. He actually broke up so many homes that\r\nthe abandoned wives formed a nunnery, which afterward grew rich.\r\n\r\nHis abilities were so marked that his superiors singled him out,\r\nwhen he had hardly finished his novitiate, to found a house in the\r\nwilderness. This house became Clairvaux, in the twelfth century the\r\nmost famous monastery of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, convents were little patronized until by some\r\nmiracle they had proved themselves worthy of hire; their early years\r\nwere often passed in poverty, and Clairvaux was no exception to the\r\nrule, for the brethren suffered privations which nearly caused revolt.\r\nIn the midst of his difficulties, Bernard’s brother Gérard, who was\r\ncellarer, came to him to complain that the fraternity were without\r\nthe barest necessities of life. The man of God asked, “How much will\r\nsuffice for present wants?” Gérard replied, “Twelve pounds.” Bernard\r\ndismissed him and betook himself to prayer. Soon after Gérard returned\r\nand announced that a woman was without and wished to speak with\r\nhim. “She, when he had come to her, prostrating herself at his feet,\r\noffered him a gift of twelve pounds, imploring the aid of his prayers\r\nfor her husband, who was dangerously sick. Having briefly spoken with\r\nher, he dismissed her, saying: ‘Go. You will find your husband well.’\r\nShe, going home, found what she had heard had come to pass. The abbot\r\ncomforting the weakness of his cellarer, made him stronger for bearing\r\nother trials from God.”[113]\r\n\r\nAlthough his family were somewhat sceptical about his gifts, and even\r\nteased him to tears, the monk William tells, in his chronicle, how he\r\nsoon performed an astounding miracle which made Clairvaux a “veritable\r\nvalley of light,” and then wealth poured in upon him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, his constitution, which had never been vigorous, had been so\r\nimpaired by his penances that he was unable to follow the monastic life\r\nin its full rigour, and he therefore threw himself into politics, to\r\nwhich he was led both by taste and by the current of events.\r\n\r\nClairvaux was founded in 1115, and fifteen years later Bernard had\r\nrisen high in his profession. The turning-point in his life was the\r\npart he took in the recognition of Innocent II. In 1130, Honorius II.\r\ndied, and two popes were chosen by the college of cardinals, Anacletus\r\nand Innocent II. Anacletus stayed in Rome, but Innocent crossed\r\nthe Alps, and a council was summoned at Étampes to decide upon his\r\ntitle. By a unanimous vote the question was referred to Bernard, and\r\nhis biographer described how he examined the evidence with fear and\r\ntrembling, and how at last the Holy Ghost spoke through his mouth,\r\nand he recognized Innocent. His decision was ratified, and soon after\r\nhe managed to obtain the adhesion of the King of England to the new\r\npontiff.\r\n\r\nHis success made him the foremost man in Europe, and when, in 1145, one\r\nof his monks was raised to the papacy as Eugenius III., he wrote with\r\ntruth, “I am said to be more pope than you.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one ever lived more highly gifted with the ecstatic\r\ntemperament than Saint Bernard. He had the mysterious attribute of\r\nmiracles, and, in the twelfth century, the miracle was, perhaps, the\r\nhighest expression of force. To work them was a personal gift, and the\r\npossessor of the faculty might, at his caprice, use his power, like the\r\nsorcerer, to aid or injure other men.\r\n\r\nOne day as Saint Bernard was on his way to a field at harvest time, the\r\nmonk who drove the donkey on which he rode, fell in an epileptic fit.\r\n“Seeing which the holy man had pity on him, and entreated God that for\r\nthe future he would not seize him unaware.” Accordingly from that day\r\nuntil his death, twenty years after, “whenever he was to fall from that\r\ndisease, he felt the fit coming for a certain space of time, so that he\r\nhad an opportunity to lie down on a bed, and so avert the bruises of a\r\nsudden fall.”[114]\r\n\r\nThis cure was a pure act of grace, like alms, made to gratify the whim\r\nof the saint; and a man who could so control nature was more powerful\r\nthan any other on earth. Bernard was such a man, and for this reason he\r\nwas chosen by acclamation to preach the second crusade.\r\n\r\nHis sermons have perished, but two of his letters have survived,[115]\r\nand they explain the essential weakness of a military force raised on\r\nthe basis of supernatural intervention. He looked upon the approaching\r\ncampaign as merely the vehicle for a miracle, and as devised to offer\r\nto those who entered on it a special chance for salvation. Therefore\r\nhe appealed to the criminal classes. “For what is it but an exquisite\r\nand priceless chance of salvation due to God alone, that the Omnipotent\r\nshould deign to summon to his service, as though they were innocent,\r\nmurderers, ravishers, adulterers, perjurers, and those guilty of every\r\ncrime?”[116]\r\n\r\nEven had an army composed of such material been well disciplined and\r\nwell led, it would have been untrustworthy in the face of an adversary\r\nlike Nour-ed-Din; but Louis VII. of France was as emotional and as\r\nirrational as Saint Bernard. His father had been a great commander,\r\nbut he himself had been educated in the Abbey of Saint Denis, and\r\njustified his wife’s scornful jest, who, when she left him for Raymond\r\nde Poitiers, said she had married a monk. The whole world held him\r\nlightly, even the priests sneered at him, and Innocent II. spoke of\r\nhim as a child “who must be stopped from learning rebellion.” Indeed,\r\nthe pope underrated him, for he appointed his own nephew to the See\r\nof Bourges in defiance of the king, and the insult roused him to\r\nresistance. Louis raised an army and invaded the County of Champagne,\r\nwhere the bishop had taken refuge. There he stormed and burnt Vitry,\r\nand some thirteen hundred men, women, and children, who had taken\r\nrefuge in the church, perished in the flames of the blazing town.\r\nHorror seems to have unhinged his mind, absolution did not calm him,\r\nand at last he came to believe that his only hope of salvation lay\r\nin a pilgrimage to the Sepulchre. On Palm Sunday, 1146, when Bernard\r\nharangued a vast throng at Vézelay, the king was the first to prostrate\r\nhimself, and take the cross from his hands.\r\n\r\nWith that day began the most marvellous part of the saint’s marvellous\r\ncareer, and were the events which followed less well authenticated,\r\nthey would be incredible. In that age miracles were as common as\r\nmedical cures are now, and yet Bernard’s performances so astonished\r\nhis contemporaries that they drew up a solemnly attested record of what\r\nthey saw, that the story of his preaching might never be questioned.\r\n\r\nWhen he neared a town the bells were rung, and young and old, from far\r\nand near, thronged about him in crowds so dense that, at Constance, no\r\none saw what passed, because no one dared to venture into the press. At\r\nTroyes he was in danger of being suffocated. Elsewhere the sick were\r\nbrought to him by a ladder as he stood at a window out of reach. What\r\nhe did may be judged by the work of a single day.\r\n\r\n   “When the holy man entered Germany he shone so marvellously by\r\n    cures, that it can neither be told in words, nor would it be\r\n    believed if it were told. For those testify who were present\r\n    in the country of Constance, near the town of Doningen, who\r\n    diligently investigated these things, and saw them with their\r\n    eyes, that in one day eleven blind received their sight by the\r\n    laying on of his hands, ten maimed were restored, and eighteen\r\n    lame made straight.”[117]\r\n\r\nThus, literally by thousands, the blind saw, the lame walked, the\r\nmaimed were made whole. He cast out devils, turned water into wine,\r\nraised the dead. But no modern description can give an idea of the\r\nparoxysm of excitement; the stories must be read in the chronicles\r\nthemselves. Yet, strangely enough, such was the strength of the\r\nmaterialistic inheritance from the Empire, that Bernard does not always\r\nseem fully to have believed in himself. He was tinged with some shade\r\nof scepticism. The meeting at Vézelay was held on March 24, 1146. Four\r\nweeks later, on April 21, at a council held at Chartres, the command\r\nof the army to invade Palestine was offered to the Abbot of Clairvaux.\r\nHad the saint thoroughly believed in himself and his twelve legions of\r\nangels, he would not have hesitated, for no enemy could have withstood\r\nGod. In fact he was panic-stricken, and wrote a letter to the pope\r\nwhich might befit a modern clergyman.\r\n\r\nAfter explaining that he had been chosen commander against his will, he\r\nexclaimed, “Who am I, that I should set camps in order, or should march\r\nbefore armed men? Or what is so remote from my profession, even had I\r\nthe strength, and the knowledge were not lacking?... I beseech you, by\r\nthat charity you especially owe me, that you do not abandon me to the\r\nwills of men.”[118]\r\n\r\nDuring 1146 and 1147 two vast mixed multitudes, swarming with criminals\r\nand women, gathered at Metz and Ratisbon. As a fighting force these\r\nhosts were decidedly inferior to the bands which had left Europe fifty\r\nyears before, under Tancred and Godfrey de Bouillon, and they were\r\nbesides commanded by the semi-emasculated King of France.\r\n\r\nThe Germans cannot be considered as having taken any part in the war,\r\nfor they perished without having struck a blow. The Greek emperor\r\ncaused them to be lured into the mountains of Asia Minor, where they\r\nwere abandoned by their guides, and wasted away from exposure, hunger,\r\nand thirst, until the Saracens destroyed them without allowing them to\r\ncome to battle.\r\n\r\nThe French fared little better. In crossing the Cadmus Mountains, their\r\nlack of discipline occasioned a defeat, which made William of Tyre\r\nwonder at the ways of God.\r\n\r\n   “To no one should the things done by our Lord be displeasing,\r\n    for all his works are right and good, but according to the\r\n    judgment of men it was marvellous how our Lord permitted the\r\n    Franks (who are the people in the world who believe in him and\r\n    honour him most) to be thus destroyed by the enemies of the\r\n    faith.”[119]\r\n\r\nSoon after this check Louis was joined by the Grand Master of the\r\nTemple, under whose guidance he reached Atalia, a Greek port in\r\nPamphylia: and here, had the king been a rationalist, he would have\r\nstormed the town and used it as a base of operations against Syria. In\r\nthe eyes of laymen, the undisguised hostility of the emperor would have\r\nfully justified such an attack. But Louis was a devotee, bound by a\r\nvow to the performance of a certain mystic formula, and one part of his\r\nvow was not to attack Christians during his pilgrimage. In his mind the\r\ndanger of disaster from supernatural displeasure was greater than the\r\nstrategic advantage; and so he allowed his army to rot before the walls\r\nin the dead of winter, without tents or supplies, until it wasted to a\r\nshadow of its former strength.\r\n\r\nFinally the governor contracted to provide shipping, but he delayed\r\nfor another five weeks, and when the transports came they were too few.\r\nEven then Louis would not strike, but abandoning the poor and sick to\r\ntheir fate, he sailed away with the flower of his troops, and by spring\r\nthe corpses of those whom he had deserted bred a pestilence which\r\ndepopulated the city.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at Antioch new humiliations and disasters awaited him.\r\nRaymond de Poitiers was one of the handsomest and most gifted men of\r\nthis time. Affable, courteous, brave, and sagacious, in many respects a\r\ngreat captain, his failing was a hot temper, which led him to his ruin.\r\nHe forsook Joscelin through jealousy, and the fall of Edessa cost him\r\nthrone and life.\r\n\r\nAfter the successes of Zenghi, a very short experience of Nour-ed-Din\r\nsufficed to convince Prince Raymond that Antioch could not be held\r\nwithout re-establishing the frontier; and when Louis arrived, Raymond\r\ntried hard to persuade him to abandon his pilgrimage for that season,\r\nand make a campaign in the north.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Tyre thought the plan good, and believed that the Saracens\r\nwere, for the moment, too demoralized to resist. Evidently, by\r\nadvancing from Antioch, Nour-ed-Din could have been isolated, whereas\r\non the south he was covered by Damascus, one of the strongest places in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations had no weight with Louis, for, to his emotional\r\ntemperament, military strategy lay in obtaining supernatural aid,\r\nwithout which no wisdom could avail, and with which victory was sure.\r\nHe therefore insisted on the punctilious performance of the religious\r\nrites, and one of the most interesting passages in _William of Tyre_ is\r\nthe account of the interview between him and Raymond, when a movement\r\nagainst the cities of the north was discussed.\r\n\r\n   “The prince, who had tried the temper of the king several\r\n    times privately, and not found what he wanted, came one day\r\n    to him before his barons and made his requests to the best of\r\n    his power. Many reasons he showed that if he would agree, he\r\n    would do his soul much good, and would win the applause of his\r\n    age; Christendom would be so benefited by this thing. The king\r\n    took counsel, and then he answered that he was vowed to the\r\n    Sepulchre, and had taken the cross particularly to go there;\r\n    that, since he had left his country, he had met with many\r\n    hindrances, and that he had no wish to begin any wars until he\r\n    had perfected his pilgrimage.”[120]\r\n\r\nThis refusal so exasperated Prince Raymond that he threw off all\r\ndisguise, and became the avowed lover of the queen, who detested her\r\nhusband. Louis, shortly afterward, escaped by night from Antioch,\r\ntaking Eleanor with him by force, and thus the only hope for the\r\nrecovery of Edessa was lost.\r\n\r\nFor the emotionalist everything yielded to the transcendent importance\r\nof propitiatory rites; therefore Louis ascended Calvary, kissed\r\nthe stones, intoned the chants, received the benediction, and lost\r\nPalestine. Thus, by the middle of the twelfth century, the idealist had\r\nbegun to flag in the struggle for life.\r\n\r\nAn attempt, indeed, was afterwards made upon Damascus, but it only\r\nserved to expose the weakness of the men who relied on magic. By\r\nthe time the advance began, confidence had been restored among the\r\nSaracens, the attack was repulsed, and Nour-ed-Din had only to move\r\nfrom the north to throw the crusaders back upon Jerusalem, covered with\r\nridicule. Nothing conveys so vivid an idea of the shock these reverses\r\ngave believers, as the words in which Saint Bernard defended his\r\nprophecies.\r\n\r\n   “Do they not say among the pagans, where is their God? Nor is\r\n    it wonderful. The sons of the Church, who are known by the name\r\n    of Christians, are laid low in the desert, destroyed by the\r\n    sword, or consumed by famine. The Lord hath poured contempt\r\n    upon princes, and hath caused them to wander in the wilderness,\r\n    where there is no way. Grief and misfortune have followed their\r\n    steps, fear and confusion have been in the palaces of the kings\r\n    themselves. How have the feet strayed of those promising peace\r\n    and blessings. We have said peace and there is no peace, we\r\n    have promised good fortune and behold tribulation, as if we\r\n    had acted in this matter with rashness and levity.... Yet if\r\n    one of two things must be, I prefer to have men murmur against\r\n    me rather than God. It is good if I am worthy to be used as a\r\n    shield. I take willingly the slanders of detractors, and the\r\n    poisoned stings of blasphemers, that they may not reach him. I\r\n    do not shrink from loss of glory that his may not be attacked,\r\n    who gives it to me to be glorified in the words of the\r\n    Psalmist: ‘Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame\r\n    hath covered my face.’”[121]\r\n\r\nAccording to the account of William of Tyre, both sides felt the end\r\nto be near. After the failure of Louis the Pious, Prince Raymond was\r\nthe first to go down before the storm he had too late seen gathering.\r\nNour-ed-Din fell upon his country with fire and sword, defeated him,\r\ncut off his head and right arm, and sent them to Bagdad as trophies.\r\nThe wretched Joscelin died in a dungeon at Aleppo, while Nour-ed-Din\r\nentered Damascus, and thus consolidated the Syrian cities of the\r\nplain. Thenceforward the decentralized Franks lay helpless in the\r\ngrasp of their compact adversary, and all that was imaginative in the\r\nMiddle Ages received its death-wound at Tiberias. That action was the\r\nbeginning of the decay of fetish-worship.\r\n\r\nThe crusaders believed they had found the cross on which Christ died\r\nat Jerusalem. They venerated it as a charm no less powerful than the\r\nSepulchre itself, and having this advantage over the tomb, that it\r\nwas portable. They thought it invincible, and used it not only as a\r\nweapon against living enemies, but as a means of controlling nature. A\r\nremarkable example of the magical properties of this relic was given in\r\nthe retreat from Bosra.\r\n\r\nBaldwin III. was crowned in 1144, when only thirteen. The kingdom\r\nwas then at peace with Damascus, in whose territory Bosra lay; but,\r\nnotwithstanding, the child’s advisers eagerly listened to the offer\r\nof the emir in command to betray the town, and hastened forward the\r\ndeparture of an expedition, in spite of the protests of the envoys\r\nfrom Damascus. On the march the troops suffered severely from heat and\r\nthirst, and on their arrival were appalled to find a loyal garrison. A\r\nsiege was out of the question, and a regular retreat so hazardous that\r\nthe barons besought the king to fly and save the cross; but the boy\r\nrefused, and stayed with his men to fight to the last. The outlook was\r\nterrible, for the vegetation was dry, and when the march began--\r\n\r\n   “The Turks threw Greek fire everywhere, so that it seemed as\r\n    if the whole country burned. The high flames and thick smoke\r\n    blinded our men. Then were they so beset they knew not what to\r\n    do. But when there is great need, and men’s help fails, then\r\n    should one seek aid of our Lord, and cry to him to care for\r\n    us; so did our Christians then; for they called the Archbishop\r\n    Robert of Nazareth, who carried the true cross before them, and\r\n    begged him that he would pray our Lord, who to save them had\r\n    suffered death upon that cross, that he would bring them from\r\n    this peril; for they could not endure it, nor did they look\r\n    for other help than his. Truly, they were there all black and\r\n    scorched, like smiths, from the fire and smoke. The archbishop\r\n    dismounted and kneeled down, and prayed our Lord with many\r\n    tears that he would have mercy on his people; then he arose\r\n    and held the true cross toward the fire which the wind brought\r\n    strongly against them. Our Lord by his great mercy regarded\r\n    his people in the great peril which they suffered; for the\r\n    wind changed straightway and blew the fire and smoke into the\r\n    faces of the enemy who had lighted it, so that they were forced\r\n    to scatter over the country and fly. Our men, when they saw\r\n    this, wept for joy, for they perceived that our Lord had not\r\n    forgotten them.”\r\n\r\nEven then they were in extreme peril, for but one way was open,\r\nfor which they had no guide. Suddenly, a “knight appeared before\r\nthe troop whom no one in the host knew. He sat a white horse, and\r\ncarried a crimson banner, he wore a hauberk, whose sleeves came only\r\nto the elbow. He offered to guide them, and he put himself in front;\r\nhe brought them to cool sweet springs; ... he made them sleep in\r\ncomfortable and good places. And he so guided them that on the third\r\nday they came to the city of Gadre.”[122]\r\n\r\nThe mighty relic of the cross was taken and defiled by the Saracens at\r\nHattin, where the Christians suffered a decisive defeat, caused by the\r\nimpotence of the central administration at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nReginald de Chatillon was the type of the twelfth century adventurer.\r\nHe came to Palestine in the train of Louis the Pious, and he stayed\r\nthere because he married a princess. He was a brave soldier, but\r\ngreedy, violent, and rash, and his insubordination precipitated the\r\ncatastrophe which led to the fall of the capital.\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Ascalon he so fascinated Constance, Princess of\r\nAntioch, widow of Raymond, that she persisted in marrying him,\r\nalthough she was sought by many of the greatest nobles, and he was\r\nonly a knight. Her choice was disastrous. He had hardly entered on his\r\ngovernment in the north before he quarrelled with the Greek emperor,\r\nwho forced him to do penance with a rope about his neck. Afterward he\r\nwas taken prisoner by Nour-ed-Din, who only liberated him after sixteen\r\nyears, when his wife was dead. He soon married again, this time also\r\nanother great heiress, Etiennette de Milly, Lady of Karak and Montréal,\r\nand, as her husband, Reginald became commander of the fortress of\r\nKarak to the east of the Dead Sea, which formed the defence against\r\nEgypt. But as the commander of so important a post, this reckless and\r\nrapacious adventurer defied the authority of his feudal superior, and\r\nby plundering caravans on the Damascus road so irritated Saladin that\r\n“in 1187 he burst, with a powerful army, into the Holy Land, made King\r\nGuy prisoner, and the Prince Reginald, whose head he cut off with his\r\nown hand.”[123]\r\n\r\nGuy de Lusignan had been crowned at Jerusalem the year before\r\nSaladin’s invasion, and when war broke out he was at feud with the\r\nCount of Tripoli. The imminence of the common danger brought about\r\nsome semblance of cohesion among the nobles, who agreed to put\r\nevery available man in the field. The castles were stripped of their\r\ngarrisons so that they were indefensible in case of reverse, and about\r\nfifty thousand troops were concentrated at Sepphoris in Galilee.\r\n\r\nThe contingents of the Temple and Hospital were well organized and well\r\ndisciplined, but the army, as a whole, was rather a loose gathering\r\nof the retainers of thirty or forty independent chiefs, than a compact\r\nmass, subject to a single will, such as the Egyptian revenues enabled\r\nSaladin to put in the field.\r\n\r\nSuddenly news came to Sepphoris, that the Saracens had poured through\r\nthe pass of Banias and lay before Tiberias. Dissensions broke out\r\nat once, which Guy de Lusignan could not control. He was not a man\r\nof strong character, and had he been, he was only one among a dozen\r\nprinces, any one of whom could quit the army and retire to his castle\r\nif he felt so disposed. The Count of Tripoli, who seems to have been\r\nthe ablest soldier among the Franks, saw the folly of leaving water and\r\nmarching across a burning country under a July sun, instead of waiting\r\nto be attacked. As he represented, he of all men was most interested\r\nin relieving Tiberias, for it was his town, and his wife was within\r\nthe walls; yet such was the jealousy of him in the Latin camp that his\r\nadvice was rejected, and an advance began on July 3, 1187.\r\n\r\nThree miles from Tiberias the action opened by a furious attack on\r\nthe rearguard, formed by the Temple and the Hospital. When they gave\r\nground Guy lost heart and ordered a halt. The night which followed was\r\nfrightful. The Moslems fired the dry undergrowth, and, amidst flames\r\nand smoke, the Franks lay till dawn, tormented by hunger and thirst,\r\nand exposed to clouds of arrows which the enemy poured in on them.\r\n\r\nAt dawn fighting began again, but the demoralized infantry fled to a\r\nhill, whence they refused to move. The Count of Tripoli, seeing the\r\nbattle lost, cut his way out with a band of his followers, but Guy de\r\nLusignan, Reginald de Chatillon, and a multitude of knights and nobles\r\nwere captured. The orders were practically annihilated, the whole\r\nable-bodied population cut to pieces, and the holy cross, which had\r\nbeen borne before the host as an invincible engine of war, was seized\r\nand defiled on the mountain where Jesus taught his disciples to love\r\ntheir enemies.\r\n\r\nEmmad-Eddin, an Arabic historian, has described the veneration of the\r\nChristians for their talisman, their adoration of it in peace, and\r\ntheir devotion to it in battles; and his words help a modern generation\r\nto conceive the shock its worshippers received when it betrayed its\r\nhelplessness.\r\n\r\n   “The great cross was taken before the king, and many of the\r\n    impious sought death about it. When it was held aloft the\r\n    infidels bent the knee and bowed the head. They had enriched\r\n    it with gold and jewels; they carried it on days of great\r\n    solemnity, and looked upon it as their first duty to defend it\r\n    in battle. The capture of this cross was more grievous to them\r\n    than the capture of their king.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nMost writers on the crusades have noticed the change which followed\r\nthe battle of Tiberias. Pigeonneau, for example, in his _History\r\nof Commerce_, pointed out that, after the loss of Jerusalem, the\r\nChristians “became more and more intent on economic interests,” and the\r\n“crusades became more and more political and commercial, rather than\r\nreligious, expeditions.” [124]\r\n\r\nIn other words, when decentralization reached its limit, the form of\r\ncompetition changed, and consolidation began. With the reopening of\r\nthe valley of the Danube, the current turned. At first the tide ran\r\nfeebly, but after the conquest of the Holy Land the channels of trade\r\naltered; capital began to accumulate; and by the thirteenth century\r\nmoney controlled Palestine and Italy, and was rapidly subduing France.\r\nHeyd remarked that “the commerce to the Levant took a leap, during the\r\ncrusades, of which the boldest imagination could hardly have dreamed\r\nshortly before,”[125] because the possession of the Syrian ports\r\nbrought Europe into direct communication with Asia, and accelerated\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of European history to the rise of modern London, the\r\nEastern trade has enriched every community where it has centred, and,\r\namong others, North Italy in the Middle Ages. Venice, Florence, Genoa,\r\nand Pisa were its creations.\r\n\r\nIn the year 452, when the barbarian migrations were flowing over\r\nthe Roman provinces in steadily increasing volume, the Huns sacked\r\nAquileia, and the inhabitants of the ravaged districts fled for\r\nshelter to the islands which lie in the shallow water at the head\r\nof the Adriatic. For many generations these fugitives remained poor,\r\nsubsisting mainly on fish, and selling salt as their only product; but\r\ngradually they developed into a race highly adapted to flourish under\r\nthe conditions which began to prevail after the council of Clermont.\r\n\r\nIsolated save toward the sea, without agriculture or mines, but two\r\npaths were open to them, piracy and commerce: and they excelled in\r\nboth. By the reign of Charlemagne they were prosperous; and when the\r\nclosing of the valley of the Danube forced traffic to go by sea, Venice\r\nand Amalfi obtained a monopoly of what was left of the Eastern trade.\r\nFor many years, however, that trade was not highly lucrative. Though\r\nRome always offered a certain market for brocades for vestments and\r\nfor altar coverings, for incense, and jewels for shrines, ready money\r\nwas scarce, the West having few products which Asiatics or Africans\r\nwere willing to take in exchange for their goods. Therefore it was\r\nnot through enterprises sanctioned by the priesthood, that Venice won\r\nin the economic competition which began to prevail in the eleventh\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nVenetians prospered because they were bolder and more unscrupulous than\r\ntheir neighbours. They did without compunction what was needful for\r\ngain, even when the needful thing was a damnable crime in the eyes of\r\nthe devout.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Nile, though fertile, produces neither wood nor iron,\r\nnor men of the fighting type; for these the caliphs were ready to pay,\r\nand the Venetians provided them all. Even as early as 971 dealings\r\nwith the common enemy in material of war had reached proportions which\r\nnot only stimulated the Emperor John Zimisces to energetic diplomatic\r\nremonstrance, but made him threaten to burn all the ships he captured\r\nladen with suspicious cargoes.\r\n\r\nTo sell timber for ships, and iron for swords, to the Saracens, was a\r\nmortal sin in children of the Church; but such a sin was as nothing\r\nbeside the infamy of kidnapping believers as slaves for infidels,\r\nwho made them soldiers to fight against their God. Charlemagne and\r\nthe popes after him tried to suppress the traffic, but without avail.\r\nSlaving was so lucrative that it was carried on in the streets of Rome\r\nherself,[126] and in the thirteenth century two thousand Europeans\r\nwere annually disposed of in Damietta and Alexandria, from whom the\r\nMamelukes, the finest corps of soldiers in the East, were recruited.\r\n\r\nThus a race grew up in Italy, which differed from the people of\r\nFrance and Germany because of the absence of those qualities which\r\nhad caused the Germans to survive when the inhabitants of the Empire\r\ndecayed. The mediæval Italians prospered because they were lacking\r\nin the imagination which made the Northern peoples subservient to\r\nthe miracle-worker, and among mediæval Italians the Venetians, from\r\ntheir exposed position, came to be the most daring, energetic, and\r\nunscrupulous. By the end of the eleventh century their fleet was\r\nso superior to the Greek, that the Emperor Alexis had to confide to\r\nthem the defence of the harbour of Durazzo against Robert Guiscard.\r\nGuiscard attacked Durazzo in 1081, at the time of the revolution which\r\nimmediately preceded the debasement of the Byzantine coinage; and the\r\ndemonstration that Venice had already absorbed most of the carrying\r\ntrade, seems to prove that, during the last half of the eleventh\r\ncentury, the centre of exchanges had a pronounced tendency to abandon\r\nConstantinople. Moreover, the result of the campaign showed that the\r\nVenetian navy was the strongest in the Mediterranean, and this was of\r\nvital moment to the success of the crusades twenty years later, for,\r\nwithout the command of the sea, the permanent occupation of Palestine\r\nwould have been impossible.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, almost the first operations of\r\nGodfrey de Bouillon were against the Syrian ports; but as he controlled\r\ntoo small a force to act alone, he made a treaty with Venice, by which,\r\nin consideration of two hundred ships, he promised to cede to her a\r\nthird part of every town taken. Baldwin made a similar arrangement\r\nwith the Genoese, and, as the coast was subdued, the Italian cities\r\nassumed their grants, and established their administrations. In the\r\nend the Venetians predominated at Tyre, the Genoese at Acre, and the\r\nPisans at Antioch. Before the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, the\r\nspices, drugs, brocades, carpets, porcelains, and gems of India and\r\nChina, reached the Mediterranean mainly by two routes. One by way of\r\nthe Persian Gulf to Bagdad, up the Euphrates to Rakka, and by land\r\nto Aleppo, whence they were conveyed by caravan either to Antioch\r\nor Damascus. Damascus, beside being the starting-place of caravans\r\nfor Mecca and Egypt, and the emporium for the products of Persia,\r\nhad important manufactures of its own. Its glass, porcelain, steel,\r\nand brocades were famous, and it was a chief market for furs, which\r\nwere highly prized throughout the Middle Ages, when heating was not\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe second route was by water. Indian merchants usually sold their\r\ncargoes at Aden, whence they were taken to a port in Upper Egypt,\r\nfloated down the Nile to Cairo, and bought by Europeans at Damietta\r\nor Alexandria. The products of Egypt itself were valuable, and next to\r\nConstantinople, Cairo was the richest city west of the Indus.\r\n\r\nWhat Europe gave to the Orientals in return is not so well known; but,\r\nbeside raw materials and slaves, her woollens were much esteemed. At\r\nall events, exchanges must have become more favourable to her, as is\r\nproved by the increased supply of the precious metals.\r\n\r\nWhy the short period of expansion, which followed upon the\r\nre-establishment of the silver standard in the West, should have been\r\nsucceeded by a sharp contraction is unknown, but the fact seems proved\r\nby the coinage. In the reign of Charlemagne a silver pound of 7680\r\ngrains was made the monetary unit, which was divided into 240 denarii,\r\nor pence.[127]\r\n\r\nFor some time these pence were tolerably maintained, but as the empire\r\nof Charlemagne disintegrated, they deteriorated until, by the end\r\nof the twelfth century, those coined at Venice were but a quarter of\r\ntheir original weight and three parts alloy.[128] After Hattin a new\r\nexpansion began, in which Venice took the lead. The battle was fought\r\nin 1187, and some years later, but probably before 1200, the grosso\r\nwas struck, a piece of fine silver, of good weight, which thereafter\r\nwas maintained at the standard. Half a century later gold appeared.\r\nFlorence coined the florin in 1252, Venice the ducat in 1284, and\r\nbetween the two dates, Saint Louis issued his crowns.\r\n\r\nThe return of the precious metals to the West indicated a revival\r\nof trade and a change in the form of competition. Instead of the\r\nimagination, the economic faculty began to predominate, and energy\r\nchose money as its vent. Within a generation the miracle fell\r\ndecisively in power, and the beginning of this most crucial of social\r\nrevolutions is visible in the third crusade, the famous expedition led\r\nby Philip Augustus and Cœur de Lion.\r\n\r\nThese two great soldiers probably learned the art of fortification at\r\nthe siege of Acre, the most remarkable passage of arms of the Middle\r\nAges. The siege is said to have cost one hundred thousand lives, and\r\ncertainly called forth all the engineering skill of the time. Guy de\r\nLusignan, having been liberated by Saladin soon after Hattin, wandered\r\nabout the country, abandoned and forlorn, until at last he sat down\r\nbefore Acre, in 1189, with a force inferior to the garrison. There\r\nhe was joined by the kings of France and England, who succeeded in\r\ncapturing the city after a desperate defence of two years. An immense\r\nbooty was taken, but the clergy complained that two secular princes had\r\nembezzled the heritage of God. On the other hand, the troops had not\r\nreceived the usual assistance from miracles; for though assaults were\r\ndelivered almost daily, none were worked, and the Virgin herself only\r\nappeared once, and then so quietly as to arouse no enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender Philip went home, while Richard remained in\r\ncommand. The whole country had been overrun, only a few strongholds\r\nlike the Krak des Chevaliers and Tortosa held out; and Richard, far\r\nfrom following the example of the first crusaders, who marched straight\r\nfor the relics at Jerusalem, turned his attention to re-establishing\r\nthe centres of trade upon the coast.\r\n\r\nHe moved south along the shore, keeping close to his fleet, with\r\nthe enemy following on the mountains. As he approached Joppa, the\r\nSaracens descended into the plain and gave battle. They were decisively\r\ndefeated, and Richard occupied Joppa without resistance. From Joppa\r\nthe road ran direct to Jerusalem. The way was not long nor the country\r\ndifficult, and there is no reason to suppose an attack to have been\r\nparticularly hazardous. On the contrary, when Richard advanced, the\r\nopposition was not unusually stubborn, and he actually pursued the\r\nenemy to within sight of the walls. Yet he resolutely resisted the\r\npressure of the clergy to undertake a siege, the inference being that\r\nthe power which controlled him held Jerusalem to be worthless. That\r\npower must have been capital, for the treaty which he negotiated was\r\nas frankly mercenary as though made in modern times. The seaboard from\r\nTyre to Joppa was ceded to the Franks; Ascalon, which was the key to\r\nEgypt, was dismantled, and the only mention made of Jerusalem was that\r\nit should be open to pilgrims in the future, as it had been in the\r\npast. Of the cross, which fifty years before had been prized above all\r\nthe treasures of the East, not a word was said, nor does it appear\r\nthat, after Hattin, either Infidels or Christians attached a money\r\nvalue to it.\r\n\r\nSome chroniclers have insisted that Richard felt remorse at thus\r\nabandoning his God; and when, in a skirmish, he saw the walls of\r\nJerusalem, they related that he hid his face and wept. He may have done\r\nso, but, during his life, the time came when Christian knights felt\r\nnaught but exultation at having successfully bartered the Sepulchre for\r\nmoney. After Richard’s departure, the situation of the Franks in the\r\nHoly Land went rapidly from bad to worse. The decay of faith constantly\r\nrelaxed the bond which had once united them against the Moslems,\r\nwhile they were divided amongst themselves by commercial jealousies.\r\nThe Temple and the Hospital carried on perpetual private wars about\r\ndisputed property, the fourth crusade miscarried, and the garrison of\r\nJoppa was massacred, while Europe looked on with indifference.\r\n\r\nWhen this point was reached, the instinct of self-preservation seems to\r\nhave roused the clergy to the fact that their fate was bound up with\r\nthe fate of the holy places: if the miracle were discredited, their\r\nreign was at an end. Accordingly, Innocent III., on his election, threw\r\nhimself into a new agitation with all the intensity of his nature.\r\nFoulques de Neuilly was chosen to preach, like Saint Bernard; but his\r\nsuccess, at first, was not flattering. He was insulted publicly by\r\nRichard, and was even accused of having embezzled the funds entrusted\r\nto him. At length, in the year 1199, Tybalt, Count of Champagne, and\r\nLouis, Count of Blois, took the cross at a tournament they were holding\r\nat the castle of Ecry. They soon were joined by others, but probably\r\nthe most famous baron of the pilgrimage was Simon de Montfort.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the twelfth century the great fiefs had not been\r\nabsorbed, and the Count of Champagne was a powerful sovereign. He was\r\ntherefore chosen leader of the expedition, and, at a meeting held\r\nat Compiègne, the three chief princes agreed to send a committee\r\nof six to Venice to contract for transportation. In this committee,\r\nVille-Hardouin, who wrote the chronicle of the war, represented Tybalt.\r\n\r\nThe doge was then Henry Dandolo, perhaps the most remarkable man Venice\r\never produced. Though nearly ninety-five, he was as vigorous as in\r\nmiddle life. A materialist and a sceptic, he was the best sailor, the\r\nablest diplomatist, and the keenest speculator in Europe; and while,\r\nas a statesman and a commander, he raised his country to the pinnacle\r\nof glory, he proved himself the easy superior of Innocent III. in\r\nintrigue. So eminent were his abilities that, by common consent, he was\r\nchosen leader of a force which held some of the foremost captains of\r\nthe age; and when, by his sagacity, Constantinople had been captured,\r\nhe refused the imperial crown.\r\n\r\nVille-Hardouin always spoke of him with deep respect as “the good duke,\r\nexceeding wise and prudent;” and, indeed, without him the Frankish\r\nprinces would certainly have fallen victims to the cunning of the\r\nGreeks, whom he alone knew how to over-reach, and whom he hated because\r\nhis eyes had been seared by the Emperor Manuel Comnenus, when he had\r\nbeen upon a mission at his court.\r\n\r\nIn his hands the Frankish envoys were like children, bewildered by\r\nthe wealth and splendour which surrounded them. After stating their\r\nerrand to Dandolo, they waited eight days for an answer, and were\r\nthen tendered a contract which has the look of having been part of a\r\npremeditated plan to ensnare the crusaders, and make them serve the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians bound themselves to provide shipping for 4500 knights\r\nwith their horses, 9000 squires, and 20,000 foot, with provisions\r\nfor nine months, for 85,000 marks of silver; probably about equal to\r\n$5,500,000 of our money. But beside this the city proposed, “for the\r\nlove of God,” to add fifty galleys, and divide the conquests equally.\r\nWhatever its character, and however much such obligations were beyond\r\nthe ability of the Franks, the contract was executed and sent to\r\nInnocent for ratification, who approved it with the proviso that no\r\nhostilities should be undertaken against Christians during the crusade.\r\nThe pilgrims were to meet at Venice in the spring.\r\n\r\nWhen Ville-Hardouin returned, Tybalt was dying, and his loss threw all\r\ninto confusion. Possibly also the suspicion spread that the Venetians\r\nhad imposed on the committee, for many of the nobles sailed from other\r\nports where better terms were to be made, among whom was Reginald de\r\nDampierre, to whom Tybalt had confided his treasure. So, in the spring\r\nof 1202, hardly more than half the knights presented themselves at\r\nVenice, and these found it quite impossible to meet their engagements.\r\nEven when the princes had sent their plate and jewels to the Ducal\r\nPalace, a deficit, estimated at 34,000 marks, remained.\r\n\r\nOn their side the Venetians declined to make any abatement of their\r\nprice, but offered as a compromise to give time, and collect the\r\nbalance from plunder. As a preliminary they proposed an attack on Zara,\r\nan Adriatic port, which had revolted and transferred its allegiance to\r\nthe King of Hungary.\r\n\r\nFew propositions could have been a greater outrage on the Church. Not\r\nonly were the people of Zara fellow-Christians, against whom the Franks\r\nhad no complaint, but the King of Hungary was himself a crusader, his\r\ndominions were under the protection of the pope, and an attack on him\r\nwas tantamount to an attack on Rome herself.\r\n\r\nOn these points difference of opinion was impossible, and the papal\r\nlegate, with all the other ecclesiastics, denounced the Venetians and\r\nthreatened them with excommunication. The result showed that force\r\nalready expressed itself in the West through money, and not through the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nWhat followed is the more interesting since it can be demonstrated\r\nthat, when beyond the Alps, and withdrawn from the pressure of\r\ncapital, the French barons were as emotional as ever. While these very\r\nnegotiations were pending, the subjects of Philip Augustus had deserted\r\nhim in a mass, and had grovelled before Innocent as submissively as if\r\nhe had been Hildebrand.\r\n\r\nThe first wife of Philip Augustus was Ingeburga, a Danish princess,\r\nfor whom he had an irrepressible disinclination. In 1195 he obtained\r\na divorce from her, by an assembly of prelates presided over by the\r\nCardinal of Champagne. He then married Agnes de Méranie, to whom he was\r\ndevotedly attached; Ingeburga appealed to Rome, and Innocent declared\r\nthe divorce void, and ordered Philip to separate “from his concubine.”\r\n\r\nPhilip refused, and Innocent commanded his legate to put the kingdom\r\nunder interdict. At Vienne, in the month of January, 1200, at the dead\r\nof night, the magical formulas were recited. When the Christ upon the\r\naltar had been veiled, the sacred wafer burned, the miracle-working\r\ncorpses hidden in the crypt, before the shuddering people, the priest\r\nlaid his curse upon the king until he should put away his harlot.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour all religious rites were suspended. The church doors\r\nwere barred, the bells were silent, the sick died unshriven, the dead\r\nlay unburied. The king summoned his bishops, and threatened to drive\r\nthem from France: it was of no avail. The barons shrank from him, his\r\nvery men-at-arms fell off from him; he was alone as Henry had been at\r\nCanossa. The people were frenzied, and even went to England to obtain\r\npriestly aid. The Count of Ponthieu had to marry Philip’s sister at\r\nRouen, within the Norman jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIn his extremity Philip called a parliament at Paris, and Agnes, clad\r\nin mourning, implored protection, but not a man moved; a mortal terror\r\nwas in every heart. She was then in the seventh month. The assembly\r\ndecided that the king must submit, and Agnes supplicated the pope not\r\nto divide her from her husband; the crown, she said, was indifferent\r\nto her. But this was a struggle for supremacy, and Innocent was\r\ninexorable. A council was convened at Néelle, where Philip promised\r\nto take back Ingeburga and part from Agnes. He explained that she\r\nwas pregnant, and to leave the realm might kill her; but the priests\r\ndemanded absolute submission, and he swore upon the evangelists to\r\nsee her no more. Agnes, broken by her misery, set forth for a Norman\r\ncastle, where she died in bearing a son, whom she called Tristan, from\r\nher sorrow at his birth.\r\n\r\nThe soldier, who belonged to the old imaginative society, had been\r\nconquered by the Church, which was the incarnation of the imagination;\r\nbut Dandolo was a different development. He was the creation of\r\neconomic competition, and he trampled the clergy under his feet.\r\n\r\nAlthough, apparently, profoundly sceptical, as the man must be who is\r\nthe channel through which money acts, he understood how to play upon\r\nthe imaginations of others, and arranged a solemn function to glorify\r\nthe Sepulchre. One Sunday he summoned both citizens and pilgrims to\r\nSaint Mark’s, and mounting the pulpit, he addressed the congregation.\r\n\r\n   “My lords, you are engaged to the greatest people of the world,\r\n    for the highest enterprise that ever was undertaken; and I am\r\n    old and feeble, and need repose, and am infirm in body; but I\r\n    see that none can command and control you as I can, who am your\r\n    doge. If you will permit me to take the cross to lead you, and\r\n    let my son stay here in my place and conduct the government, I\r\n    will go to live or die with you, and with the pilgrims.”[129]\r\n\r\nVille-Hardouin’s simple chronicle shows how perfectly the old man knew\r\nhis audience:--\r\n\r\n   “There was great pity among the people of the country and the\r\n    pilgrims, and many tears were shed, because this worthy man had\r\n    so much cause to stay behind; for he was old and ... his sight\r\n    poor.”[130]\r\n\r\nAmidst an outburst of enthusiasm assent was given. Then, while the\r\nchurch rang with shouts, Dandolo knelt before the altar, in a passion\r\nof tears fixed the cross to the ducal bonnet, and rose, the commander\r\nof the finest army in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd Dandolo was a great commander; a commander of the highest stamp.\r\nHe tolerated no insubordination, and trod the clergy down. When Peter\r\nof Capua, the papal legate, interfered, Dandolo sternly told him that\r\nthe army of Christ lacked not for military chiefs, and that if priests\r\nwould stay therein they must content themselves with prayers.\r\n\r\nA Cistercian monk, named Gunther, who had been appointed to follow his\r\nabbot on the pilgrimage, kept a chronicle of what he saw. His superior,\r\nnamed Martin, was so disheartened at Venice that he asked the legate\r\nfor absolution from his vow, and for permission to return to his\r\nconvent at Bâle; but this request the cardinal refused. The priests\r\nhad determined to stay by Dandolo and fight him to the last. Therefore\r\nthe abbot sailed with the Venetians, but he learned a bitter lesson\r\nat Zara. There the clergy received a letter from Innocent, explaining\r\nthe position of the Church, and threatening with excommunication all\r\nwho should molest the King of Hungary. Simon de Montfort and a portion\r\nof the more devout, who had from the first been scandalized at the\r\ncontract made with Dandolo, then withdrew and camped apart; and, at a\r\nmeeting called to consider the situation, Guy, Abbot of Vaux-de-Cernay,\r\ntried to read the letter. An outbreak followed, and some of the\r\nchroniclers assert that the Venetians would have murdered Guy, had not\r\nSimon de Montfort stood by him sword in hand.[131]\r\n\r\nOn the main point there is no doubt. The priests ignominiously failed\r\nto protect their ally; the attack was made, and nothing shows that even\r\nde Montfort refused to share in it, or to partake of the plunder after\r\nthe city fell. There was no resistance. The besieged made no better\r\ndefence than hanging crosses on their walls, and on the fifth day\r\ncapitulated. First the Franks divided the plunder with the Italians;\r\nthen they sent an embassy to Rome to ask for absolution.\r\n\r\nThey alleged that they were helpless, and either had to accept the\r\nterms offered by Dandolo, or abandon their enterprise. Innocent\r\nsubmitted. He coupled his forgiveness, indeed, with the condition\r\nthat the plunder should be returned;[132] yet no record remains that a\r\nsingle mark, of all the treasures taken from Zara, ever found its way\r\nback to the original owners.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians neither asked for pardon nor noticed the excommunication.\r\nOn the contrary, Dandolo used the time when the envoys were at Rome in\r\nmaturing the monstrous crime of diverting the crusade from Palestine to\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nJust before the departure from Venice, an event happened which\r\nVille-Hardouin called “one of the greatest marvels you ever heard of.”\r\nIn 1195 the Greek emperor, named Isaac, had been dethroned, imprisoned,\r\nand blinded by his brother Alexis, who usurped the throne. Isaac’s son,\r\nalso named Alexis, escaped, and took shelter with his brother-in-law,\r\nPhilip of Swabia. Philip could not help him, but suggested to him to\r\napply to the crusaders in Venice, and ask them for aid. Whether or not\r\nthis application had been arranged by Dandolo, does not appear. Alexis\r\nwent to Venice, where he was cordially received by the doge; but as\r\nthe fleet was then weighing anchor, his affairs were postponed until\r\nafter the attack on Zara, when an embassy from Philip arrived, which\r\nbrought up the whole situation at Constantinople for consideration.\r\nIn the struggle which followed between the Venetians and the Church,\r\nthe Franks lay like a prize destined to fall to the stronger, and in\r\nGunther’s narrative the love the priests bore their natural champions\r\ncan be plainly seen. In the thirteenth century, as in the fifth\r\ncentury, the ecclesiastics recognized that over a monied oligarchy they\r\ncould never have control; accordingly the monks hated the Venetians,\r\nwhom Gunther stigmatized as “a people excessively greedy of money,”\r\nalways ready to commit sacrilege for gain.\r\n\r\nOn his side Dandolo followed his instinct, and tried to bribe the\r\npope by offering him an union of the communions. But Innocent was\r\ninflexible. He wrote in indignation that the crusaders had sworn to\r\navenge the wrongs of Christ, and likened those who should turn back to\r\nLot’s wife, whom God turned into a pillar of salt for disobeying his\r\ncommands.[133]\r\n\r\nYet, though the priesthood put forth its whole strength, it was beaten.\r\nThe power of wealth was too great. No serious defection took place.\r\nVille-Hardouin gave a list of those who left the fleet, among whom was\r\nSimon de Montfort, adding contemptuously, “Thus those left the host,\r\n... which was great shame to them.”[134]\r\n\r\nJudging by the words alone, a century might have separated the writer\r\nand his comrades from the barons who abandoned Agnes to Innocent; yet\r\nthey were the same men transplanted to an economic civilization, and\r\nexcited by the power of wealth.\r\n\r\nOn Easter Monday, 1203, the fleet sailed for Corfu, where another and\r\nmore serious split occurred. But the dazzling prize finally prevailed\r\nover the fear of the supernatural, and, getting under way once more,\r\nthe pilgrims crossed the Sea of Marmora, and anchored at the convent\r\nof Saint Stephen, about twelve miles from Constantinople. Since\r\nexchanges had again returned to Italy, the vitality of the Greek Empire\r\nhad burned low. It was failing fast through inanition. But Byzantium\r\nwas still defended by those stupendous fortifications which were\r\nimpregnable from the land, and only to be assailed from the sea by an\r\nadmiral of genius.\r\n\r\nSuch an one was Dandolo, a born seaman, sagacious yet fiery; and,\r\nbesides, a pilot of the port. At a council of war he laid out a plan of\r\ncampaign:--\r\n\r\n   “My lords, I know more of the character of this country than\r\n    you do, for I have been here before. You have before you the\r\n    greatest and most perilous enterprise which any men have ever\r\n    undertaken, and therefore it would be well that we should act\r\n    prudently.”[135]\r\n\r\nHe then explained how the attack should be made; and had the Franks\r\nimplicitly obeyed him, the town would have been carried at the first\r\nassault. Three days later the allies occupied Scutari, the Asiatic\r\nsuburb of Constantinople, and lay there ten days collecting supplies.\r\nOn the twelfth they stormed the tower of Galata, which commanded Pera,\r\nthe key to the Golden Horn. While the action was going on, Dandolo\r\nforced his way into the port. The entrance was defended not only by a\r\ngreat tower, but by a huge iron chain, fastened to piles, and covered\r\nby twenty galleys armed with machines.\r\n\r\nNothing stopped the Venetians. Disregarding the fire, the sailors\r\nsprang on the chain, and from thence gained the decks of the Greek\r\ngalleys, whose crews they threw overboard. Meanwhile, one of the\r\nItalian ships, provided with steel shears, bore down on the cable, cut\r\nit, and led the way into the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe weakest part of the walls being uncovered, Dandolo insisted that\r\nthe only hope for success lay in assaulting from ship-board where the\r\nbattlements were lowest; but the French obstinately refused to depart\r\nfrom their habits, and determined to fight on horseback. The event\r\nproved Dandolo’s wisdom; for though the attack failed through the\r\nmistake of dividing the force, and of attempting the fortifications\r\ntoward the land, the doge so led his sailors that Ville-Hardouin\r\nkindled with enthusiasm as he told the tale.\r\n\r\nWhen the old man saw his ships recoil before the tremendous fire from\r\nthe battlements,\r\n\r\n   “so that the galleys could not make the land, then there\r\n    was seen a strange sight, for the duke of Venice, who was an\r\n    old man, and saw not well, was fully armed and commanded his\r\n    galley, and had the gonfalon of Saint Mark’s before him; and\r\n    he cried to his men to put him ashore, or if they would not he\r\n    would do justice on their bodies; and they brought the galley\r\n    to shore, and they sallied forth and carried the banner before\r\n    him to the shore. And when the Venetians saw the gonfalon of\r\n    Saint Mark’s ashore, and the galley of the lord ashore before\r\n    them, they were all ashamed and made for the land, and rushed\r\n    out from their ships pell-mell. Then might one see a marvellous\r\n    assault. And thus testifies Geoffrey de Ville-Hardouin, the\r\n    marshal of Champagne, who dictates this book, that more than\r\n    forty declare they saw the banner of Saint Mark of Venice on\r\n    one of the towers, and none knew who carried it thither.”[136]\r\n\r\nOnce a foothold on the ramparts had been gained, the Greeks fled,\r\ntwenty-five towers fell in quick succession, and the Italians had\r\nalready entered the streets and fired the houses to drive the enemy\r\nfrom the roofs, when news was brought that Alexis was advancing from\r\nthe gates, and threatened to envelop the French. Indeed, the danger\r\nwas extreme; for, as Ville-Hardouin explained, the crusaders were\r\nwondrous few when compared with the garrison, for they “had so many\r\nmen we should all have been engulfed amongst them.”[137] With the\r\ninstinct of a great commander, Dandolo instantly sounded a retreat,\r\nabandoned the half-conquered town, and hastened to the support of his\r\nallies. He reached the ground opportunely, for Alexis, when he saw the\r\nreinforcement, retreated without striking a blow.\r\n\r\nThat night Alexis fled, leaving Constantinople without a government;\r\nand the people took the blind Isaac from his dungeon and set him on the\r\nthrone. In theory, therefore, the work of the crusaders was done, and\r\nthey were free to embark for Palestine to battle for the Sepulchre.\r\nIn fact, the thing they came for remained to be obtained, and what\r\nthey demanded amounted to the ruin of the empire. Young Alexis had\r\npromised 200,000 marks of silver, to join the crusade himself, to\r\nprovide rations for a year, and to recognize the supremacy of Rome; but\r\nsuch promises were impossible to fulfil. During a delay of six months\r\nthe situation daily grew more strained, a bitter hatred sprang up\r\nbetween the foreigners and the natives, riots broke out, conflagrations\r\nfollowed, and at last the allies sent a deputation to the palace to\r\ndemand the execution of the treaty.\r\n\r\nIn despair, Alexis attacked the fleet with fire-ships, and his failure\r\nled to a revolution in which he was killed. Isaac died from terror,\r\nand one Moursouffle was raised to the throne. In their extremity the\r\nGreeks had recourse to treachery, and nearly succeeded in enticing\r\nthe Frankish princes to a banquet, at which they were to have been\r\nassassinated. The plot was frustrated by the sagacity of Dandolo, who\r\nwould allow no one to trust themselves within the walls; then both\r\nsides prepared for war.\r\n\r\nDefeat had taught the Franks obedience, and they consented to serve on\r\nthe galleys. They embarked on April 8, 1204, to be ready for an assault\r\nin the morning. But though the attack was made in more than one hundred\r\nplaces at once, “yet for our sins were the pilgrims repulsed.” Then the\r\nlandsmen proposed to try some other part of the walls, but the sailors\r\ntold them that elsewhere the current would sweep them away; and “know,”\r\nsaid the marshal, “there were some who would have been well content\r\nhad the current swept them away” altogether, “for they were in great\r\nperil.”[138]\r\n\r\nThis repulse fell on a Friday; the following Monday the attack was\r\nrenewed, and at first with small success, but at length--\r\n\r\n   “Our Lord raised a wind called Boreas ... and two ships which\r\n    were lashed together, the one named the _Pilgrim_ and the other\r\n    the _Paradise_, approached a tower on either side, just as God\r\n    and the wind brought them, so that the ladder of the _Pilgrim_\r\n    was fixed to the tower; and straightway a Venetian and a French\r\n    knight ... scaled the tower, and others followed them, and\r\n    those in the lower were discomforted and fled.”[139]\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the walls were carried, the battle turned into a\r\nmassacre. The ramparts were scaled in all directions, the gates were\r\nburst open with battering rams, the allies poured into the streets, and\r\none of the most awful sacks of the Middle Ages began.\r\n\r\nNothing was so sacred as to escape from pillage. The tombs of the\r\nemperors were violated, and the body of Justinian stripped. The altar\r\nof the Virgin, the glory of Saint Sophia, was broken in pieces, and\r\nthe veil of the sanctuary torn to rags. The crusaders played dice on\r\nthe tables which represented the apostles, and drank themselves drunk\r\nin the holy chalices. Horses and mules were driven into the sanctuary,\r\nand when they fell under their burdens, the blood from their wounds\r\nstained the floor of the cathedral. At last a young prostitute mounted\r\nthe patriarch’s chair, intoned a lewd chant, and danced before the\r\npilgrims. Thus fell Constantinople, by the arms of the soldiers of\r\nChrist, on the twelfth day of April, in the year one thousand two\r\nhundred and four. Since the sack of Rome by Alaric no such prize\r\nhad ever fallen to a victor, and the crusaders were drunk with their\r\nsuccess. Ville-Hardouin estimated that the share of the Franks, after\r\ndeducting some fifty thousand marks which the Venetians collected from\r\nthem, came to four hundred thousand marks of silver, not to speak of\r\nmasses of plunder of which no account was taken. The gain was so great\r\nthere seemed no end to the gold and silver, the precious stones, the\r\nsilks, the ermines, and whatever was costly in the world.\r\n\r\n   “And Geoffrey de Ville-Hardouin testifies of his own knowledge,\r\n    that since the beginning of time, there was never so much\r\n    taken in one town. Every one took what he wanted, and there was\r\n    enough. Thus were the host of the pilgrims and of the Venetians\r\n    quartered, and there was great joy and honour for the victory\r\n    which God had given them, since those who had been poor were\r\n    rich and happy.”[140]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the soothsayers, the devotees of Louis the Pious had\r\nperished by tens of thousands, and over their corpses the Moslems\r\nhad marched to victory. The defenders of Christ’s cross had been\r\nslaughtered like sheep upon the mountains of the Beatitudes, and sold\r\ninto slavery in herds at Damascus and Aleppo; even the men who, at the\r\nbidding of God’s vicar, had left Dandolo to fight for the Sepulchre\r\nupon the barren hills of Palestine, had been immolated. Five hundred\r\nhad perished in shipwreck, more had been massacred in Illyria, none\r\nhad received reward. But those who, in defiance of the supernatural and\r\nin contempt of their vow, had followed the excommunicated Venetian to\r\nplunder fellow-Christians, had won immeasurable glory, and been sated\r\nwith incalculable spoil.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims who, constant to the end, had been spilling their blood\r\nin God’s service, came trooping to the Bosphorus to share in the last\r\nremaining crumbs; the knights of the Temple and the Hospital set sail\r\nfor Greece, where money might still be made by the sword, and the King\r\nof Jerusalem stood before the Tomb, naked unto his enemies. Innocent\r\nhimself was cowed; his commands had been disregarded and his curse\r\ndefied; laymen had insulted his legate, and had, without consulting\r\nhim, divided among themselves the patronage of the Church; and yet for\r\nthe strongest there was no moral law. When Baldwin announced that he\r\nwas emperor, the pope called him “his dearest son,” and received his\r\nsubjects into the Roman communion.[141]\r\n\r\nBut yesterday, the greatest king of Christendom had stood weeping,\r\nbegging for the life of his wife; a hundred years earlier an emperor\r\nhad stood barefoot, and freezing in the snow, at the gate of Canossa,\r\nas a penance for rebellion; but in 1204 a Venetian merchant was blessed\r\nby the haughtiest of popes for having stolen Christ’s army, made war\r\non his flock, spurned his viceregent, flouted his legate, and usurped\r\nhis patrimony. He had appointed a patriarch without a reference to\r\nRome. All was forgiven, the appointment was confirmed, the sinner\r\nwas shriven; nothing could longer resist the power of money, for\r\nconsolidation had begun.\r\n\r\nYet, though nature may discriminate against him, the emotionalist will\r\nalways be an emotionalist, for such is the texture of his brain; and\r\nwhile he breathes, he will hate the materialist. The next year Baldwin\r\nwas defeated and captured by the Bulgarians, and then Innocent wrote\r\na letter to the Marquis of Montferrat, which showed how the wound had\r\nrankled when he blessed the conqueror.\r\n\r\nHe said bitterly:--\r\n\r\n   “You had nothing against the Greeks, and you were false to\r\n    your vows because you did not fight the Saracens, but the\r\n    Christians; you did not capture Jerusalem, but Constantinople;\r\n    you preferred earthly to heavenly treasures. But what was far\r\n    graver, you have spared neither religion, nor age, nor sex, and\r\n    you have committed adulteries, fornications and incests before\r\n    men’s eyes.... Nor did the imperial treasures suffice you, nor\r\n    the plunder alike of rich and poor. You laid your hands on the\r\n    possessions of the Church, you tore the silver panels from\r\n    the altars, you broke into the sanctuaries and carried away\r\n    the images, the crosses and the relics, so that the Greeks,\r\n    though afflicted by persecution, scorn to render obedience\r\n    to the apostolic chair, since they see in the Latins nothing\r\n    but an example of perdition and of the works of darkness, and\r\n    therefore rightly abhor them more than dogs.”[142]\r\n\r\nFor the north and west of Europe the crusade of Constantinople seems to\r\nhave been the turning point whence the imagination rapidly declined.\r\nAt the opening of the thirteenth century, everything shows that the\r\ngenuine ecstatic type predominated in the Church--the quality of mind\r\nwhich believed in the miracle, and therefore valued the amulet more\r\nthan money. Innocent himself, with all his apparent worldliness, must\r\nhave been such a man; for, though the material advantages of a union\r\nwith the Greek Church far outweighed the Sepulchre, his resistance to\r\nthe diversion of the army from Palestine was unshaken to the last. The\r\nsame feeling permeated the inferior clergy; and an anecdote told by\r\nGunther shows that even so late as the year 1204 the monks unaffectedly\r\ndespised wealth in its vulgar form.\r\n\r\n   “When therefore the victors set themselves with alacrity\r\n    to spoil the conquered town, which was theirs by right of\r\n    war, the abbot Martin began to think about his share of the\r\n    plunder; and lest, when everything had been given to others,\r\n    he should be left empty-handed, he proposed to stretch out his\r\n    consecrated hand to the booty. But since he thought the taking\r\n    of secular things unworthy, he bestirred himself to obtain a\r\n    portion of the sacred relics, which he knew were there in great\r\n    quantities.”[143]\r\n\r\nThe idea was no sooner conceived than executed. Although private\r\nmarauding was punished with death, he did not hesitate, but hastened\r\nto a church, where he found a frightened old monk upon his knees, whom\r\nhe commanded in a terrible voice to produce his relics or prepare for\r\ndeath. He was shown a chest full to the brim. Plunging in his arms, he\r\ntook all he could carry, hurried to his ship and hid his booty in his\r\ncabin; and he did this in a town whose streets were literally flowing\r\nwith gold and silver. He had his reward. Though a sacrilegious thief,\r\nangels guarded him by sea and land until he reached his cloister at\r\nBâle. Then he distributed his plunder through the diocese.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when the form of competition has abruptly changed, nature\r\nworks rapidly. Within a single generation after Hattin, the attitude,\r\nnot only of the laity but of the clergy, had been reversed, and money\r\nwas recognized, even by the monks, as the end of human effort.\r\n\r\nThe relics at Jerusalem had first drawn the crusaders to the East, and,\r\nincidentally, the capture of the Syrian seaports led to the reopening\r\nof trade and the recentralization of the Western world. As long as\r\nimagination remained the dominant force, and the miracle retained its\r\npower, the ambition of the Franks was limited to holding the country\r\nwhich contained their talismans; but as wealth accumulated, and the\r\neconomic type began to supplant the ecstatic, a different policy came\r\nto prevail.\r\n\r\nBeside the cities of the Holy Land, two other portions of the Levant\r\nhad a high money value--the Bosphorus and the valley of the Nile. In\r\nspite of Rome, the Venetians, in 1204, had seized Constantinople; at\r\nthe Lateran council of 1215, Innocent himself proposed an attack on\r\nCairo. Though conceived by Innocent, the details of the campaign were\r\narranged by Honorius III., who was consecrated in July, 1216; these\r\ndetails are, however, unimportant: the interest of the crusade lies in\r\nits close. John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, nominally commanded,\r\nbut the force he led little resembled Dandolo’s. Far from being that\r\ncompact mass which can only be given cohesion by money, it rather\r\nhad the character of such an hysterical mob as Louis the Pious led to\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nAfter some semblance of a movement on Jerusalem, the army was conveyed\r\nto the Delta of the Nile, and Damietta was invested in 1218. Here\r\nthe besiegers amounted to little more than a fluctuating rabble of\r\npilgrims, who came and went at their pleasure, usually serving about\r\nsix months. Among such material, military discipline could not exist;\r\nbut, on the contrary, the inflammable multitude were peculiarly adapted\r\nto be handled by a priest, and soon the papal legate assumed control.\r\nCardinal Pelagius was a Spaniard who had been promoted by Innocent in\r\n1206. His temperament was highly emotional, and, armed with plenary\r\npower by Honorius, he exerted himself to inflame the pilgrims to the\r\nutmost. After a blockade of eighteen months Damietta was reduced to\r\nextremity, and to save the city the sultan offered the whole Holy Land,\r\nexcept the fortress of Karak, together with the funds needed to rebuild\r\nthe walls of Jerusalem. King John, and all the soldiers, who understood\r\nthe difficulty of invading Egypt, favoured a peace; but Pelagius,\r\nwhose heart was fixed on the plunder of Cairo, prevented the council\r\nfrom reaching a decision. Therefore the siege went on, and presently\r\nthe ramparts were carried without loss, as the whole population had\r\nperished from hunger and pestilence.\r\n\r\nThis victory made Pelagius a dictator, and he insisted on an advance\r\non the capital. John, and the grand masters of the military orders,\r\npointed out the disaster which must follow, as it was July, and the\r\nNile was rising. In a few weeks the country would be under water.\r\nMoreover, the fleet could not ascend the river, therefore the army must\r\nbe isolated in the heart of a hostile country, and probably overwhelmed\r\nby superior numbers.\r\n\r\nPelagius reviled them. He told them God loved not cowards, but\r\nchampions who valued his glory more than they feared death. He\r\nthreatened them with excommunication should they hang back. Near\r\nmidsummer, 1221, the march began, and the pilgrims advanced to the apex\r\nof the delta, where they halted, with the enemy on the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nThe river was level with its banks, the situation was desperate, and\r\nyet even then the sultan sent an embassy offering the whole of the\r\nHoly Land in exchange for the evacuation of Egypt. The soldiers of all\r\nnations were strenuously for peace, the priests as strenuously for war.\r\nThey felt confident of repeating the sack of Constantinople at Cairo,\r\nnor can there be a greater contrast than Martin spurning the wealth of\r\nConstantinople as dross, and Pelagius rejecting the Sepulchre that he\r\nmight glut himself with Egyptian wealth.\r\n\r\nBut all history shows that the emotionalist cannot compete with the\r\nmaterialist upon his own ground. In the end, under free economic\r\ncompetition, he must be eliminated. Pelagius tarried idly in the jaws\r\nof death until the Nile rose and engulfed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SUPPRESSION OF THE TEMPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical weakness has always been the vulnerable point of the sacred\r\ncaste, for priests have rarely been warriors, and faith has seldom\r\nbeen so profound as to guarantee ecclesiastics against attack.\r\nThis difficulty was marked in the early Middle Ages, when, although\r\ndisintegration so far prevailed as to threaten the very tradition of\r\ncentralized power, a strong leaven of the ancient materialism remained.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century the trend toward decentralization was resistless.\r\nAlthough several of the descendants of Charlemagne were men of\r\nability and energy, the defence was so superior to the attack that\r\nthey could not coerce their vassals, and their domains melted away\r\ninto independent sovereignties until the crown became elective, and\r\nthe monarchy almost a tradition. During the tenth century it seems\r\npossible that the regal authority might have been obliterated, even to\r\nthe last trace, had it not been for the Church, which was in sore need\r\nof a champion. The priesthood cared nothing for the legitimate line;\r\nwhat they sought was a protector, and accordingly they chose, not the\r\ndescendant of Charlemagne, but him who, in the words of the Archbishop\r\nof Rheims, was “distinguished by his wisdom and who found support in\r\nthe greatness of his soul.” Hugh Capet succeeded Louis V. because he\r\nwas the best chief of police in France.\r\n\r\nFrom such an alliance, between the priest and the soldier, has always\r\nsprung the dogma of the divine right of kings. In mediæval Europe,\r\nenchantment was a chief element of the royal power. The monarch\r\nwas anointed with a magic oil, girt with a sacred sword, given a\r\nsupernatural banner, and endowed with the gift of miracles. His touch\r\nhealed disease. In return for these gifts, he fought the battles of the\r\nChurch, whose property was the natural prey of a predatory baronage.\r\nEvery diocese and every abbey was embroiled in endless local wars,\r\nwhich lasted from generation to generation, and sometimes from century\r\nto century. A good example was the interminable feud between the Abbey\r\nof Vézelay and the Counts of Nevers, and a letter of a papal legate\r\nnamed Conon, which described one of the countless raids, gives an idea\r\nof the ferocity of the attack.\r\n\r\n   “The men of the Count of Nevers have burst open the doors\r\n    of the cloister, have thrown stones on the reliquaries which\r\n    contain the bodies of Saint Lazarus, of Saint Martha, of Saint\r\n    Andocious, and of Saint Pontianus; they have not even respected\r\n    the crucifix in which was preserved a morsel of the true cross,\r\n    they have beaten the monks, they have driven them out with\r\n    stones, and having taken one of them, they have treated him in\r\n    an infamous manner.”[144]\r\n\r\nUntil the stimulus given by the crusades was felt, subinfeudation went\r\non uninterruptedly; the Capetians were as unable to stem the current\r\nas the Carlovingians before them, so that, under Philip I., the royal\r\ndomain had become almost as much dismembered as the kingdom of Lothaire\r\na century earlier. Consolidation began after the council of Clermont,\r\nand Suger’s _Life of Louis the Fat_ is the story of the last years of\r\nthe partisan warfare between the crown and the petty nobility which had\r\nbeen going on since the time of Hugh Capet.\r\n\r\nDuring this long period the kings had fought a losing battle,\r\nand without the material resources of the Church would have been\r\noverpowered. Even as it was they failed to hold their own, and yet the\r\nwealth of the clergy was relatively enormous. The single abbey of Saint\r\nDenis was said to have controlled ten thousand men, and though this may\r\nbe an exaggeration, the corporation was organized on a gigantic scale.\r\n\r\nBetween the eleventh and thirteenth centuries it held in France alone\r\nthree cities, upwards of seventy-four villages, twenty-nine manors\r\nattached to these possessions, over a hundred parishes, and a great\r\nmany chapels bringing in valuable rentals, beside numerous vineyards,\r\nmills and fields, with fifteen forests of the first class.[145]\r\n\r\nSuger’s description of the country at the beginning of the twelfth\r\ncentury is highly dramatic. Every strong position, like a hill or\r\na forest, was a baron’s hold, from whence he rode to plunder and\r\ntorment the people. One of the most terrible of these robbers was\r\nHugh du Puiset, a man whom the Abbot of Saint Denis calls a ruffian,\r\nthe issue of a long line of ruffians. To the churchman, Hugh was the\r\nincarnation of evil. He oppressed the clergy, and though hated by all,\r\nfew dared oppose him. At last he attacked Adèle, Countess of Chartres,\r\ndaughter of William the Conqueror, who went with her son Tybalt to\r\nseek redress from the king. Louis did not relish the campaign, and the\r\nmonk described how the lady taunted him with the defeat his father had\r\nsuffered from the father of Hugh, who pursued him to Orléans, captured\r\na hundred of his knights, and cast his bishops into dungeons.\r\n\r\nAfterward, an assembly was held at Melun to consider the situation,\r\nand there a concourse of prelates, clerks, and monks “threw themselves\r\nat the king’s feet and implored him, to his great embarrassment, to\r\nrepress this most greedy robber Hugh, who, more rapacious than a wolf,\r\ndevoured their lands.”[146]\r\n\r\nCertainly the priests had cause for alarm, for the venerable Archbishop\r\nof Chartres, who was present, had been captured, loaded with irons, and\r\nlong left to languish in prison.\r\n\r\nThree times this baron was defeated, but even when a prisoner, his\r\nfamily connection was so powerful he was permitted to escape. At last\r\nhe died like a wolf, fighting to the last, having impaled the Seneschal\r\nof France on his spear.\r\n\r\nEven singly, such men were almost a match for both Church and Crown;\r\nbut when joined in a league, especially if allied to one of the great\r\nfeudatories, such as the Duke of Normandy, they felt sure of victory.\r\nOne day, when Eudes, Count of Corbeil, was to join this very Hugh,\r\nhe put aside his armour-bearer who was attending him, and said to his\r\nwife: “Pray, noble countess, bring the glittering sword to the noble\r\ncount, since he who takes it from you as a count, shall to-day return\r\nit as a king.”[147]\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the crusades was to carry numbers of these\r\npetty princes to Palestine, where they were often killed or ruined. As\r\ntheir power of resistance weakened, the crown gained, and Louis the Fat\r\nreconquered the domain. His active life began in 1097, the year of the\r\ninvasion of Palestine, and his absorption of the lordship of Montlhéri\r\nis a good illustration of his success.\r\n\r\nThe family of Rochefort-Montlhéri owned several of the strongest\r\ndonjons near Paris, and was divided into two branches, the one\r\nrepresented by Guy Trousseau, Lord of Montlhéri, the other by Guy the\r\nRed, Lord of Rochefort. Guy Trousseau’s father was named Milo, and\r\nall three went to Syria, where Milo was killed, and his son disgraced\r\nhimself. Suger spoke of him with extreme disdain:--\r\n\r\n   “Guy Trousseau, son of Milo of Montlhéri, a restless man and\r\n    a disturber of the kingdom, returned home from a pilgrimage\r\n    to the Holy Sepulchre, broken down by the anxiety of a long\r\n    journey and by the vexation of many troubles. And ... [being]\r\n    panic stricken at Antioch at the approach of Corboran, and\r\n    escaping down from a wall [he] ... abandoned the army of God\r\n    and fled destitute of everything.” [148]\r\n\r\nReturning a ruined man, he married his daughter to the illegitimate\r\nson of Philip, a half-brother of Louis, a child of twelve; and as\r\nhis guardians, the king and prince got possession of the castle. This\r\ncastle was almost at the gates of Paris, and a standing menace to the\r\ncommunications of the kingdom: therefore their delight was great. “They\r\nrejoiced as though they had taken a straw from their eyes, or as though\r\nthey had burst the barrier which imprisoned them.”[149] And the old\r\nking said to his son: “Guard well the tower, Louis, which has aged me\r\nwith chagrin, and through whose treachery and wicked fraud I have never\r\nknown peace and quiet.”[150]\r\n\r\nYet the destruction of the local nobility in Syria was the least\r\nimportant part of the social revolution wrought by the crusades, for\r\nthough the power of the barons might have thus been temporarily broken,\r\nthey could never have been reduced to impotence unless wealth had grown\r\nequal to organizing an overwhelming attack. The accumulation of wealth\r\nfollowed the opening of the Eastern trade, and its first effect was to\r\ncause the incorporation of the communes.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1095 but one town is known to have been chartered, Saint\r\nQuentin, the capital of Vermandois, about 1080,[151] but after the\r\nopening of the Syrian ports the whole complexion of society changed.\r\nNoyon was chartered in 1108, Laon in 1111, Amiens in 1113, and then\r\nfree boroughs sprang up on every side.\r\n\r\nFor want of the mariner’s compass, commerce could not pass north by\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar. Merchandise had therefore to go by land, and\r\nexchanges between the north and south of Europe centred in the County\r\nof Champagne, whose fairs became the great market of the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe earliest dated document relating to these fairs is a deed drawn in\r\n1114 by Hugh, Count of Troyes, by which he conveyed certain revenues\r\nderived from them to the Abbey of Montier-en-Der. Fifty years later,\r\nsuch mentions had grown frequent, and by the year 1200 the fairs had\r\nattained their full development.[152]\r\n\r\nWeaving had been an industry in Flanders under the Romans, and in the\r\ntime of Charlemagne the cloth of the Low Countries had been famous;\r\nbut in the twelfth century the manufacture spread into the adjoining\r\nprovinces of France, and woollen became the most valuable European\r\nexport. The fleeces were brought chiefly from England, the weaving was\r\ndone on the Continent, and one of the sources of the Florentine wealth\r\nwas the dressing and dyeing of these fabrics to prepare them for the\r\nAsiatic market.\r\n\r\nFor mutual defence, the industrial towns of the north formed a league\r\ncalled the Hanse of London, because London was the seat of the chief\r\ncounting-house. This league at first included only seventeen cities,\r\nwith Ypres and Bruges at the head, but the association afterward\r\nincreased to fifty or sixty, stretching as far west as Le Mans, as far\r\nsouth as the Burgundian frontier, and as far east as Liège. Exclusive\r\nof the royal domain, which was well consolidated under Philip Augustus,\r\nthe French portion of this region substantially comprised the counties\r\nof Blois, Vermandois, Anjou, Champagne, and the Duchy of Normandy.\r\nThis district, which has ever since formed the core of France, became\r\ncentralized at Paris between the beginning of the reign of Philip\r\nAugustus in 1180 and the reign of Philip the Fair a century later, and\r\nthere can be little doubt that this centralization was the effect of\r\nthe accumulation of capital, which created a permanent police.\r\n\r\nThe merchants of all the cities of the league bound themselves to\r\ntrade exclusively at the fairs of Champagne, and, to prosper, the\r\nfirst obstacle they had to overcome was the difficulty and cost\r\nof transportation. Not only were the roads unsafe, because of the\r\nstrength of the castles in which the predatory nobility lived, but the\r\nmultiplicity of jurisdictions added to taxes. As late as the end of\r\nthe thirteenth century, a convention was made between fifteen of the\r\nmore important Italian cities, such as Florence, Genoa, Venice, and\r\nMilan, and Otho of Burgundy, by which, in consideration of protection\r\nupon the roads, tolls were to be paid at Gevry, Dôle, Augerans, Salins,\r\nChalamont, and Pontarlier. When six imposts were levied for crossing\r\na single duchy, the cost of importing the cheaper goods must have been\r\nprohibitory.\r\n\r\nThe Italian caravans reached Champagne ordinarily by two routes: one\r\nby some Alpine pass to Geneva, and then through Burgundy; the other by\r\nwater to Marseilles or Aigues-Mortes, up the Rhone to Lyons, and north,\r\nsubstantially as before. The towns of Provins, Troyes, Bar-sur-Aube,\r\nand Lagny-sur-Marne lie about midway between Bruges and Ypres on the\r\none side, and Lyons and Geneva on the other, and it was at these cities\r\nthat exchanges centralized, until the introduction of the mariner’s\r\ncompass caused traffic to go by the ocean, and made Antwerp the monied\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nThe market was, in reality, open continuously, for six fairs were held,\r\neach six weeks long, and the trade was so lucrative that places which,\r\nin 1100, had been petty villages, in 1200 had wealth enough to build\r\nthose magnificent cathedrals which are still wonders of the world.\r\n\r\nThe communal movement had nothing about it necessarily either liberal\r\nor democratic. The incorporated borough was merely an instrument of\r\ntrade, and at a certain moment became practically independent, because\r\nfor a short period traders organized locally, before they could\r\namalgamate into centralized communities with a revenue sufficient to\r\npay a police capable of coercing individuals.\r\n\r\nWhat the merchant wanted was protection for trade, and, provided he\r\nhad it, the form in which it came was immaterial. Where the feudal\r\ngovernment was strong, communes did not exist: Paris never had a\r\ncharter. Conversely, where the government was weak, communes grew\r\nup, because traders combined for mutual protection, and therefore the\r\ncommunes reached perfection in ecclesiastical capitals.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the secular nobility rather favoured the incorporated\r\ntowns, because they could sell to them their services as policemen, and\r\ncould join with them in plundering the Church;[153] on their side the\r\ntradesmen were always ready to commute personal military service into a\r\ntax, and thus both sides benefited. To the Church, on the contrary, the\r\nrise of the mercantile class was pure loss, not only because it caused\r\ntheir vassals to seek better protection than ecclesiastics could give,\r\nbut because the propagation of the materialistic mind bred heresy. The\r\nclergy had no police to sell, and the townsmen had, therefore, either\r\nto do the work themselves or hire a secular noble. In the one case they\r\nbecame substantially independent; in the other they transferred their\r\nallegiance to a stranger. In any event, a new fief was carved out of\r\nan ecclesiastical lordship, and such accessions steadily built up the\r\nroyal domain.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, the sacred class seems to have been conscious of\r\nits danger, and some of the most ferocious wars of the Middle Ages\r\nwere those waged upon ecclesiastical serfs who tried to organize for\r\nself-defence. In one of his books Luchaire has told, at length, the\r\nstory of the massacre of the peasantry of the Laonnais by a soldier\r\nwhom the chapter of Laon elected bishop for the purpose,[154] and this\r\nwas but a single case out of hundreds. Hardly a bishop or an abbot\r\nlived at peace with his vassals, and, as the clergy were the natural\r\nprey of the secular nobility, the barons often sided with the populace,\r\nand used the burghers as an excuse for private war. A speech made by\r\none of the Counts of Nevers, during a rising of the inhabitants of\r\nVézelay, gives a good idea of the intrigues which kept the prelates in\r\nperpetual misery.\r\n\r\n   “O very illustrious men, celebrated for great wisdom, valiant\r\n    by your strength and rich by the riches you have acquired\r\n    by your own merit, I am deeply afflicted at the miserable\r\n    condition to which you are reduced. Apparently the possessors\r\n    of much, in reality you are masters of nothing; and more than\r\n    this, you do not enjoy any portion of your natural liberty....\r\n    If I think on these things I am greatly astonished, and ask\r\n    myself what has become of, or rather to what depth of cowardice\r\n    has fallen within you, that vigour formerly so renowned, when\r\n    you put to death your Lord, the abbot Artaud.”\r\n\r\nThe count then dwelt upon the harshness of the living abbot, and ended\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n   “Separate from this man, and bind yourselves to me by a mutual\r\n    agreement: if you consent, I engage myself to free you from all\r\n    exactions, from all illegal rentals, and to defend you from the\r\n    evils which are ready to fall upon you.”[155]\r\n\r\nWherever developed, the mercantile mind had always the same\r\ncharacteristic: it was unimaginative, and, being unimaginative, it\r\ndoubted the utility of magic. Accordingly, all commercial communities\r\nhave rebelled against paying for miracles, and it was the spread of a\r\nscepticism already well developed in the thirteenth century among the\r\nmanufacturing towns, which caused the Reformation of the sixteenth. At\r\nSaint-Riquier the monks carried the relics of Saint Vigor each year\r\nin procession. In 1264 the burghers took a dead cat and put it in a\r\nshrine, while in another casket they placed a horse-bone, to do service\r\nas the arm of Saint Vigor. When the procession reached a certain spot,\r\nthe reliquaries were set down, and a mock fight began between two\r\nmummers. Then the bearers cried out, “Old Saint Riquier, you shall\r\ngo no further unless you reconcile these enemies,” whereupon the\r\ncombatants fell into each other’s arms, and all cried out that Saint\r\nRiquier had wrought a miracle.\r\n\r\nAfterward they built a chapel and oratory, with an altar draped with\r\ncloth of gold, and deposited the dead cat and the horse-bone; and\r\nsimple pilgrims, ignorant of the sacrilege, stopped to worship the\r\nrelics, the mayor and council aiding and abetting the crime, “to the\r\ndetriment of the whole Church universal.”[156]\r\n\r\nThe clergy retaliated with frightful ferocity. As heresy followed in\r\nthe wake of trade, the Inquisition followed in the wake of heresy, and\r\nthe beginning of the thirteenth century witnessed simultaneously the\r\nprosperity of the mercantile class and the organization of the Holy\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nJacques de Vitry breathed the ecclesiastical spirit. One of the\r\nmost famous preachers of his age, he rose from a simple monk to\r\nbe Cardinal-bishop of Tusculum, legate in France, and Patriarch of\r\nJerusalem. He led a crusade against the Albigenses, was present at\r\nthe siege of Damietta, and died at Rome in 1240. His sermons burn\r\nwith his hatred of the bourgeoisie: “That detestable race of men ...\r\nhurrying to meet its fate, which none or few could escape,” all of whom\r\n“were making haste toward hell.... But above all other evils of these\r\nBabylonish cities, there is one which is the worst, for hardly is there\r\na community to be found in which there are not abettors, receivers,\r\ndefenders of, or believers in, heretics.”[157]\r\n\r\nThe basis of the secular society of the early Middle Ages was\r\nindividual physical force. Every layman, noble or serf, owed military\r\nservice, and when a borough was incorporated, it took its place in\r\nthe feudal hierarchy, like any other vassal. With the spread of the\r\nmercantile type, however, a change began--the transmutation of physical\r\nforce into money--and this process went on until individual strength or\r\ncourage ceased to have importance.\r\n\r\nAs soldiers the burgesses never excelled; citizen troops have seldom\r\nbeen formidable, and those of the communes rarely withstood the first\r\nonset of the enemy. The tradesmen themselves recognized their own\r\nlimitations, and in 1317 the deputies of the cities met at Paris and\r\nrequested the government to undertake the administration of the local\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\nThough unwarlike, the townsmen were wealthy, and, in the reign of\r\nPhilip Augustus, the same cause which led to the consolidation of\r\nthe kingdom, brought about, as Luchaire has pointed out, “a radical\r\nmodification of the military and financial organization of the\r\nmonarchy;” the substitution by the privileged corporations of money\r\npayments for personal service.[158]\r\n\r\nThus, from the time when the economic type had multiplied sufficiently\r\nto hire a police, the strength of the State came to depend on\r\nits revenue, and financiers grew to be the controlling element of\r\ncivilization. Before the crusades, the high offices of the kingdom\r\nof France, such as the office of the seneschal, were not only held by\r\nnobles, but tended to become hereditary in certain warlike families.\r\nAfter the rise of the Eastern trade the royal council was captured by\r\nthe bourgeoisie. Jacques Cœur is a striking specimen of the class which\r\nruled in the fifteenth century. Of this class the lawyers were the\r\nspokesmen, and men like Flotte and Nogaret, the chancellors of Philip\r\nthe Fair, expressed the notion of centralization as perfectly as the\r\njurists of ancient Rome. No one has understood the movement better\r\nthan Luchaire. He has pointed out, in his work on French institutions,\r\nthat from the beginning of the reign of Saint Louis (1226) the Privy\r\nCouncil steadily gained in consequence.[159] The permanent civil\r\nservice, of which it was the core, served as a school for judges,\r\nclerks, seneschals, and all judicial and executive officers. At first\r\nthe administration retained a strong clerical tinge, probably because\r\na generation elapsed before laymen could be equally well trained for\r\nthe work, but after the accession of Philip the Fair, toward the end\r\nof the century, the laymen decisively predominated, and when they\r\npredominated, the plunder of the Church began.\r\n\r\nAbstract justice is, of course, impossible. Law is merely the\r\nexpression of the will of the strongest for the time being,\r\nand therefore laws have no fixity, but shift from generation to\r\ngeneration. When the imagination is vivid and police weak, emotional or\r\necclesiastical law prevails. As competition sharpens, and the movement\r\nof society accelerates, religious ritual is supplanted by civil codes\r\nfor the enforcement of contracts and the protection of the creditor\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe more society consolidates the more legislation is controlled by the\r\nwealthy, and at length the representatives of the monied class acquire\r\nthat absolute power once wielded by the Roman proconsul, and now\r\nexercised by the modern magistrate.\r\n\r\n   “The two great figures of Saint Louis and of Philip the Fair\r\n    which dominate the third period are profoundly unlike, but\r\n    considering the facts as a whole ... [they] have but moderately\r\n    influenced the direction of the communal development. With\r\n    the bailiffs and Parliament the monarchical machine is in\r\n    possession of its essential works; it operates and will stop\r\n    no more. In vain the king shall essay to arrest its march, or\r\n    to direct it in another course: the innumerable army of agents\r\n    of the crown does not cease for a moment to destroy rival\r\n    jurisdictions, to suppress embarrassing powers, to replace\r\n    everywhere private jurisdictions by the single authority of the\r\n    sovereign.\r\n\r\n   “To the infinite diversity of local liberties its will is\r\n    to substitute regularity of institutions; political and\r\n    administrative centralization.”[160]\r\n\r\nAs Luchaire has elsewhere observed, the current everywhere\r\n“substituted, in the paths of administration, justice, and finance,\r\nthe lay and burgher for the ecclesiastical and noble element.” In\r\nother words, the economic type steadily gained ground, and the process\r\nwent on until the Revolution. Saint Simon never forgave Louis XIV. for\r\nsurrounding himself with men of mean birth, dependent on his will.\r\n\r\n   “The Duke of Beauvilliers was the single example in the whole\r\n    course of his reign, as has been remarked in speaking of this\r\n    duke, the only nobleman who was admitted into his council\r\n    between the death of Cardinal Mazarin and his own; that is to\r\n    say, during fifty-four years.”[161]\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the twelfth to the middle of the thirteenth century\r\nwas an interval of almost unparalleled commercial prosperity--a\r\nprosperity which is sufficiently proved by the sumptuous quality of the\r\narchitecture of the time. Unquestionably the most magnificent buildings\r\nof modern Europe date from this period, and this prosperity was not\r\nlimited to any country, but extended from Cairo to London. Such an\r\nexpansion of trade would have been impossible without a corresponding\r\nexpansion of the currency, and as no new mines were discovered,\r\nrecourse was had to paper. By the year 1200 bills of exchange had been\r\nintroduced,[162] and in order to give the bill of exchange its greatest\r\ncirculating power, a system of banking was created which operated as\r\na universal clearing house, and by means of which these bills were\r\nbalanced against each other.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, Florence, Genoa, and Venice were the chief\r\nmonied centres. In these cities the purchase and sale of commercial\r\npaper was, at the outset, monopolized by a body of money-changers,\r\nwho, in Venice at least, seem to have been controlled by the council\r\nof merchants, and who probably were not always in the best credit.\r\nAt all events, they were required in 1318 to make a deposit of\r\n£3,000 as security for their customers, and afterward the amount\r\nwas increased.[163] Possibly some such system of deposits may have\r\noriginally formed the capital of the Bank of Venice, but everything\r\nrelating to the organization of the mediæval banks is obscure. All that\r\nseems certain is, that business was conducted by establishments of\r\nthis character long before the date of any records which now remain.\r\nAmidst the multiplicity of mediæval jurisdictions, not only did the\r\ncurrency become involved in inextricable confusion, but it generally\r\nwas debased through abrasion and clipping. Before clearings could be\r\nconveniently made, therefore, a coinage of recognized value had to\r\nbe provided, and this the banks undertook to supply by their system\r\nof deposits. They received coin fresh from the mints, for which they\r\ngave credits, and these credits or notes were negotiable, and were\r\nalways to be bought in the market. The deposits themselves were seldom\r\nwithdrawn, as they bore a premium over common currency, which they lost\r\nwhen put in circulation, and they were accordingly only transferred\r\non the books of the corporations, to correspond with the sales of\r\nthe notes which represented them. Thus merchants from all parts of\r\nEurope and the Levant could draw on Venice or Genoa, and have their\r\nbalances settled by transfers of deposits at the banks, without the\r\nintervention of coin. A calculation has been made that, by this means,\r\nthe effective power of the currency was multiplied tenfold. Of all\r\nthese institutions, the corporations of Genoa and Venice were the most\r\nfamous. The Bank of Saint George, at Genoa, was formally organized in\r\n1407, but it undoubtedly had conducted business from the beginning of\r\nthe twelfth century;[164] next to nothing is known of the development\r\nat Venice. Probably, however, Florence was more purely a monied centre\r\nthan either Venice or Genoa, and no money-lenders of the Middle Ages\r\never equalled the great Florentine banking families. Most of the\r\nimportant commercial centres came to have institutions of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of credit had the same effect as a large addition\r\nto the stock of bullion, and, as gold and silver grew more plentiful,\r\ntheir relative value fell, and a general reform of the currency took\r\nplace. Venice began the movement with the grosso, it spread through\r\nItaly and into France, and the coin of Saint Louis was long considered\r\nas perfect money.\r\n\r\nWith the expansion of the currency went a rise in prices, all\r\nproducers grew rich, and, for more than two generations, the strain of\r\ncompetition was so relaxed that the different classes of the population\r\npreyed upon each other less savagely than they are wont to do in less\r\nhappy times.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile no considerable additions were made to the volume of the\r\nprecious metals, and, as the bulk of commerce swelled, the capacity of\r\nthe new system of credit became exhausted, and contraction set in. The\r\nfirst symptom of disorder seems to have been a rise in the purchasing\r\npower of both the precious metals, but particularly of gold, which\r\nrose in its ratio to silver from about one to nine and a half, to\r\none to twelve.[165] At the same time the value of commodities, even\r\nwhen measured in silver, appears to have fallen sharply.[166] The\r\nconsequence of this fall was a corresponding addition to the burden\r\nof debt, and a very general insolvency. The communes had been large\r\nborrowers, and their straits were deplorable. Luchaire has described\r\ntheir condition as shown “in the municipal accounts addressed by the\r\ncommunes to the government.”[167] Everywhere there was a deficit,\r\nalmost everywhere ruin. Amiens, Soissons, Roye, Saint Quentin, and\r\nRouen were all in difficulty with their loans, but Noyon was perhaps\r\nthe worst of all. In 1278 Noyon owed 16,000 pounds which it was\r\nunable to pay. After a suspension for fourteen years the king issued\r\nan ordinance regulating liquidation; a part of the claims had to be\r\ncancelled, and the balance collected by a levy on private property. The\r\nbankruptcy was complete.\r\n\r\nThe royal government, equally hardly pressed, was unable to meet its\r\nobligations in the standard coin, and resorted to debasement. Under\r\nSaint Louis the mark of silver yielded but 2 pounds 15 sous 6 pence;\r\nin 1306 the same weight of metal was cut into 8 pounds 10 sous.\r\nThe pressure upon the population was terrible, and led to terrible\r\nresults--the beginning of the spoliation of the emotionalists.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the combination of the two great forces of the age, of the\r\nsoldier and the monk, was the supreme effort of the emotional mind.\r\nWhat a hold the dazzling dream of omnipotence, through the possession\r\nof the Sepulchre, had upon the twelfth century, can be measured by\r\nthe gifts showered upon the crusading orders, for they represented a\r\nprodigious sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAt Paris the Temple had a capital city over against the capital of the\r\nking. Within a walled enclosure of sixty thousand square metres, stood\r\nthe conventual buildings and a gigantic donjon of such perfect masonry\r\nthat it never needed other repairs than the patching of its roof.\r\nBeyond the walls the domain extended to the Seine, a property which,\r\neven in 1300, had an almost incalculable value.\r\n\r\nOn every Eastern battle-field, and at every assault and siege, the\r\nknights had fought with that fiery courage which has made their name a\r\nproverb down to the present day. In 1265, at Safed, three hundred had\r\nbeen butchered upon the ramparts in cold blood, rather than renounce\r\ntheir faith. At Acre, whose loss sealed the fate of Palestine, they\r\nheld the keep at all odds until the donjon fell, burying Christians and\r\nMoslems in a common grave. But skill and valour avail nothing against\r\nnature. Step by step the Templars had been driven back, until Tortosa\r\nsurrendered in 1291. Then the Holy Land was closed, the enthusiasm\r\nwhich had generated the order had passed away, and, meanwhile,\r\neconomic competition had bred a new race at home, to which monks were a\r\npredestined prey.\r\n\r\nIn 1285, as the Latin kingdom in Syria was tottering towards its\r\nfall, Philip the Fair was crowned. Subtle, sceptical, treacherous,\r\nand cruel, few kings have left behind them a more sombre memory, yet\r\nhe was the incarnation of the economic spirit in its conflict with\r\nthe Church. Nine years later Benedetto Gaetani was elected pope:\r\na man as completely the creation of the social revolution of the\r\nthirteenth century as Philip himself. Trained at Bologna and Paris, a\r\njurist rather than a priest, his faith in dogma was so scanty that his\r\nbelief in the immortality of the soul has been questioned. A thorough\r\nworldling, greedy, ambitious, and unscrupulous, he was suspected of\r\nhaving murdered his predecessor, Celestin V.\r\n\r\nWhen Boniface came to the throne, the Church is supposed to have\r\nowned about one-third of the soil of Europe, and on this property the\r\ngovernments had no means of enforcing regular taxation. Toward the\r\nclose of the thirteenth century the fall of prices increased the weight\r\nof debt, while it diminished the power of the population to pay. On\r\nthe other hand, as the system of administration became more complex,\r\nthe cost of government augmented, and at last the burden became more\r\nthan the laity could endure. Both England and France had a permanent\r\ndeficit, and Edward and Philip alike turned toward the clergy as\r\nthe only source of supply. Both kings met with opposition, but the\r\nexplosion came in France, where Clairvaux, the most intractable of\r\nconvents, appealed to Rome.\r\n\r\nBoniface had been elected by a coalition between the Colonna and the\r\nOrsini factions, but after his coronation he turned upon the Colonnas,\r\nwho, in revenge, plundered his treasure. A struggle followed, which\r\nended fatally to the pope; but at first he had the advantage, sacked\r\ntheir city of Præneste, and forced them to fly to France. On the brink\r\nof this war, Boniface was in no condition to rouse so dangerous an\r\nadversary as Philip, and, in answer to Clairvaux’s appeal, he confined\r\nhimself to excommunicating the prince who should tax the priest and the\r\npriest who should pay the impost.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the issue had to be met. The Church had weakened as\r\nterror of the unknown had waned, and could no longer defend its wealth,\r\nwhich was destined to pass more and more completely into the hands of\r\nthe laity.\r\n\r\nPhilip continued his aggressions, and, when peace had been established\r\nin Italy, the rupture came. Not realizing his impotence, and\r\nexasperated at the royal policy, Boniface sent Bernard de Saisset,\r\nBishop of Pamiers, to Paris as his ambassador. Bernard had recently\r\nbeen consecrated in defiance of Philip, and they were bitter enemies.\r\nHe was soon dismissed from court, but he continued his provocations,\r\ncalling the king a false coiner and a blockhead, and when he returned\r\nto Pamiers he plotted an insurrection. He was arrested and prosecuted\r\nby the Chancellor Flotte, but when delivered to the Archbishop of\r\nNarbonne for degradation, action was suspended to await the sanction\r\nof Rome. Then Flotte was sent to Italy to demand the surrender “of\r\nthe child of perdition,” that Philip might make of him “an excellent\r\nsacrifice to God.” The mission necessarily failed, for it was a\r\nstruggle for supremacy, and the issue was well summed up in the final\r\nwords of the stormy interview which brought it to a close. “My power,\r\nthe spiritual power,” cried Boniface, “embraces and encloses the\r\ntemporal.” “True,” retorted Flotte, “but yours is verbal, the king’s is\r\nreal.”\r\n\r\nAn ecclesiastical council was convoked for October, 1302, and Philip\r\nwas summoned to appear before the greatest prelates of Christendom.\r\nBut, not waiting the meeting of this august assembly, Boniface, on\r\nDecember 5, 1301, launched his famous bull, “Ausculta, fili,” which was\r\nhis declaration of war.[168]\r\n\r\nListen, my son: do not persuade yourself that you have no superior, and\r\nare not in subjection to the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy: he\r\nwho says this is mad, he who sustains it is an infidel. You devour the\r\nrevenues of the vacant bishoprics, you pillage churches. I do not speak\r\nnow of the alterations in the coinage, and of the other complaints\r\nwhich arise on all sides, and which cry to us against you, but not to\r\nmake myself accountable to God for your soul, I summon you to appear\r\nbefore me, and in case of your refusal shall render judgment in your\r\nabsence.[169]\r\n\r\nA century before, the barons of France had abandoned Philip Augustus,\r\nthrough fear of the incantations of Innocent, but, in the third\r\ngeneration of the commercial type, such fears had been discarded. In\r\nApril, 1302, the estates of the realm sustained the “little one-eyed\r\nheretic,” as Boniface called Flotte, in burning the papal bull, and in\r\nanswering the admonitions of the pope with mockery.\r\n\r\n   “Philip, by the grace of God king of the French, to Boniface,\r\n    who calls himself sovereign pontiff, little greeting or none.\r\n    Let your very great foolishness know that we are subject to\r\n    no one for the temporalty; that the collation to the vacant\r\n    churches and prebends belongs to us by royal right; that\r\n    their fruits are ours; that collations which have been made,\r\n    or are to be made by us, are valid for the past and for the\r\n    future, and that we will manfully protect their possessors\r\n    against all comers. Those who think otherwise we hold fools or\r\n    madmen.”[170]\r\n\r\nThe accepted theory long was that the bourgeoisie were neutral in\r\nthis quarrel; that they were an insignificant factor in the state,\r\nand obeyed passively because they were without the power to oppose. In\r\nreality, consolidation had already gone so far that money had become\r\nthe prevailing form of force in the kingdom of France; therefore the\r\nmonied class was on the whole the strongest class, and Flotte was their\r\nmouthpiece. They accepted the papers drawn by the chancellor, because\r\nthe chancellor was their representative.[171]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1302, Philip met with the defeat of Courtray, and the tone\r\nof the ecclesiastical council, convened in October, shows that the\r\nclergy thought his power broken. A priest relies upon the miracle, and,\r\nif defied, he must either conquer by supernatural aid, or submit to\r\nsecular coercion. Boniface boldly faced the issue, and planted himself\r\nby Hildebrand. In his bull, Unam Sanctam, he defined his claim to the\r\nimplicit obedience of laymen.\r\n\r\n   “We are provided, under his authority, with two swords,\r\n    the temporal and the spiritual; ... both, therefore, are\r\n    in the power of the Church; to wit, the spiritual and the\r\n    material sword: ... the one is to be used by the priest,\r\n    the other by kings and soldiers; sed ad nutum et patientiam\r\n    sacerdotis.”[172]\r\n\r\nA sentence of excommunication had also been prepared and sent to\r\nFrance, which was to have been followed by deposition; but when it\r\narrived, Philip convened an assembly of prelates and barons at the\r\nLouvre, and presented an indictment against Boniface, probably without\r\na parallel in modern history. The pope was accused of every crime. He\r\nwas an infidel, a denier of the immortality of the soul, a scoffer at\r\nthe eucharist, a murderer, and a sorcerer. He was guilty of unnatural\r\ncrimes and of robbery.[173]\r\n\r\nThe bearer of the bull was arrested, the property of the bishops who\r\nhad attended the council sequestered, and Philip prepared to seize\r\nBoniface in his own palace. Boniface, too, felt the decisive hour at\r\nhand. He tried to reconcile himself with his enemies, drew the bull of\r\ndeposition, and prepared to affix it to the church door at Anagni on\r\nSeptember 8, 1303. Before the day came he was a prisoner, and face to\r\nface with death.\r\n\r\nFlotte had been killed at Courtray, and had been succeeded by the\r\nredoubtable Nogaret, whose grandfather was believed to have been burned\r\nas a heretic. With Nogaret Philip joined Sciarra Colonna, the bloodiest\r\nof the Italian nobles, and sent them together to Italy to deal with\r\nhis foe. Boniface had made war upon the Colonnas, and Sciarra had\r\nbeen hunted like a wild beast. Flying disguised, he had been taken by\r\npirates, and had preferred to toil four years as a galley-slave, rather\r\nthan run the risk of ecclesiastical mercy by surrendering himself to\r\nthe vicar of Christ. At last Philip heard of his misfortunes, bought\r\nhim, and, at the crisis, let him slip like a mad dog at the old man’s\r\nthroat. Nogaret and Colonna succeeded in corrupting the governor of\r\nAnagni, and entered the town at dead of night; but the pope’s nephews\r\nhad time to barricade the streets, and it was not until the church,\r\nwhich communicated with the papal apartments, had been fired, that\r\nthe palace was forced. There, it was said, they found the proud old\r\npriest sitting upon his throne, with his crown upon his head, and men\r\nwhispered that, as he sat there, Colonna struck him in the face with\r\nhis gauntlet.\r\n\r\nProbably the story was false, but it reflected truly enough the spirit\r\nof the pope’s captors. He himself believed them capable of poisoning\r\nhim, for from Saturday night till Monday morning he lay without food\r\nor drink, and when liberated was exhausted. Boniface was eighty-six,\r\nand the shock killed him. He was taken to Rome, and died there of\r\nfever, according to the rumour, blaspheming, and gnawing his hands in\r\nfrenzy.[174]\r\n\r\nThe death of Boniface was decisive. Benedict XI., who succeeded him,\r\ndid not attempt to prolong the contest; but peace without surrender was\r\nimpossible. The economic classes held the emotionalists by the throat,\r\nand strangled them till they disgorged.\r\n\r\nVainly Benedict revoked the acts of his predecessor. Philip demanded\r\nthat Boniface should be branded as a heretic, and sent Nogaret to\r\nRome as his ambassador. The insult was more than the priesthood could\r\nyet endure. Summoning his courage, Benedict excommunicated Nogaret,\r\nColonna, and thirteen others, whom he had seen break into the palace\r\nat Anagni. Within a month he was dead. Poison was whispered, and, for\r\nthe first time since the monks captured the papacy, the hierarchy was\r\nparalyzed by fear. No complaint was made, or pursuit of the criminal\r\nattempted; the consistory met, but failed to unite on a successor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the legend, when the cardinals were unable to agree, the\r\nfaction opposed to Philip consented to name three candidates, from whom\r\nthe king should select the pope. The prelate he chose was Bertrand de\r\nGoth, Archbishop of Bordeaux. Boniface had been his patron, but Philip,\r\nwho knew men, knew that this man had his price. The tale goes that\r\nthe king visited the bishop at an abbey near Saint-Jean-d’Angély, and\r\nbegan the conversation as follows: “My lord Archbishop, I have that in\r\nmy hand will make you pope if I like, and it is for that I am come.”\r\nBertrand fell on his knees, and the king imposed five conditions,\r\nreserving a sixth, to exact thereafter. The last condition was the\r\ncondemnation of the Templars.[175]\r\n\r\nDoubtless the picturesque old tale is as false in detail as it is\r\ntrue in spirit. Probably no such interview took place, and yet there\r\nseems little doubt that Clement owed his election to Philip, and gave\r\npledges which bound him from the day of his coronation. Certainly\r\nhe surrendered all liberty of action, for he established himself at\r\nAvignon, whence the battlements of Ville-Neuve can still be seen, built\r\nby Philip to overawe the town. Within an hour he could have filled the\r\nstreets with his mercenaries. The victory was complete. The Church was\r\nprostrate, and spoliation began.\r\n\r\nClement was crowned in 1305, and after two years of slavery he began\r\nto find his compact heavy upon him. He yielded up the patronage,\r\nhe consented to the taxation of the clergy, and he ordered the\r\ngrand-masters of the crusading orders to return to Europe, all at\r\nPhilip’s bidding. But when he was commanded to condemn Boniface as a\r\nheretic, he recoiled in terror. Indeed, to have rejected Boniface as an\r\nimpostor, and a false pope, would have precipitated chaos. His bishops\r\nand cardinals would have been set aside, Clement’s own election would\r\nhave been invalidated; none could foresee where the disorganization\r\nwould end. To gain time, Clement pleaded for a general council,\r\nwhich the king morosely conceded, but only on the condition that the\r\nexcommunications against his agents, even against Nogaret, should\r\nbe withdrawn. Clement assented, for he was practically a prisoner at\r\nPoitiers, a council at Vienne was agreed to, and the Crown seized the\r\nTemplars without opposition from the Church.\r\n\r\nCriticism has long ago dispelled the mystery which once shrouded this\r\nbloody process. No historian now suggests that the knights were really\r\nguilty of the fantastic enormities charged against them, and which they\r\nconfessed under torture. Scepticism doubtless was rife among them, as\r\nit was among the cardinals, but there is nothing to show that the worst\r\ndiffered materially from the population about them, and the superb\r\nfortitude with which they perished, demonstrates that lack of religious\r\nenthusiasm was not the crime for which they died.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip conceived the idea of first murdering and then plundering\r\nthe crusaders, is uncertain. Some have thought it was in 1306, while\r\nsheltered in the Temple, when, he having suddenly raised his debased\r\nmoney to the standard of Saint Louis, the mob destroyed the house of\r\nhis master of the mint. Probably it was much earlier, and was but the\r\nnecessary result of the sharpening of economic competition, which began\r\nwith the accelerated movement accompanying the crusades.\r\n\r\nAfter Clement’s election, several years elapsed before the scheme\r\nripened. Nothing could be done until one or both of the grand-masters\r\nhad been enticed to France with their treasure. Under pretence of\r\npreparing for a new crusade this was finally accomplished, and, in\r\n1306, Jacques de Molay, a chivalrous Burgundian gentleman, journeyed\r\nunsuspectingly to Paris, taking with him his chief officers and one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand florins in gold, beside silver “enough to\r\nload ten mules.”\r\n\r\nPhilip first borrowed all the money de Molay would lend, and then,\r\nat one sudden swoop, arrested in a single night all the Templars\r\nin France. On October 13, 1307, the seizure was made, and Philip’s\r\norganization was so perfect, and his agents so reliable, that the plan\r\nwas executed with precision.\r\n\r\nThe object of the government was plunder, but before the goods\r\nof the order could be confiscated, legal conviction of some crime\r\nwas necessary, which would entail forfeiture. Heresy was the only\r\naccusation adapted to the purpose; accordingly Philip determined to\r\nconvict the knights of heresy, and the best evidence was confession. To\r\nextort confession the Inquisition had to be set in motion by the pope,\r\nand thus it came to pass that, in order to convey to the laymen the\r\nproperty of ecclesiastics, Christ’s soldiers were tormented to death by\r\nhis own vicar.\r\n\r\nIn vain, in the midst of the work, Clement, in agonies of remorse,\r\nrevoked the commissions of the inquisitors. Philip jeered when the\r\ncardinals delivered the message, saying “that God hated the lukewarm,”\r\nand the torture went on as before. When he had extorted what he needed,\r\nhe set out for Poitiers; Clement fled, but was arrested and brought\r\nback a prisoner. Then his resolution gave way, and he abandoned the\r\nknights to their fate, reserving only the grand-master and a few high\r\nofficials for himself. Still, though he forsook the individuals, he\r\ncould not be terrified into condemning the order in its corporate\r\ncapacity, and the final process was referred to the approaching\r\ncouncil. Meanwhile, a commission, presided over by the Archbishop of\r\nNarbonne, proceeded with the trial of the knights.\r\n\r\nFor three years these miserable wretches languished in their dungeons,\r\nand the imagination recoils from picturing their torments. Finally\r\nPhilip felt that an end must be made, and in March, 1310, 546 of the\r\nsurvivors were taken from their prisons and made to choose delegates,\r\nfor their exasperation was so deep that the government feared to let\r\nthem appear before the court in a body.\r\n\r\nThe precaution availed little, for the knights who conducted the common\r\ndefence proved themselves as proud and bold in this last extremity of\r\nhuman misery, as they had ever been upon the day of battle. They denied\r\nthe charges brought against them, they taunted their judges with the\r\nlies told them to induce them to confess, and they showed how life and\r\nliberty had been promised them, under the royal seal, if they would\r\nadmit the allegations of the government. Then they told the story of\r\nthose who had been steadfast to the end.\r\n\r\n   “It is not astonishing that some have borne false witness,\r\n    but that any have told the truth, considering the sorrows\r\n    and suffering, the threats and insults, they daily endure....\r\n    What is surprising is that faith should be given to those who\r\n    have testified untruly to save their bodies, rather than to\r\n    those who have died in their tortures in such numbers, like\r\n    martyrs of Christ, in defence of the truth, or who solely for\r\n    conscience sake, have suffered and still daily suffer in their\r\n    prisons, so many torments, trials, calamities, and miseries,\r\n    for this cause.”[176]\r\n\r\nThe witnesses called confirmed their statements. Bernard Peleti, when\r\nexamined, was asked if he had been put to the torture. He replied that\r\nfor three months previous to his confession to the Bishop of Paris, he\r\nhad lain with his hands so tightly bound behind his back that the blood\r\nstarted from his finger nails. He had beside been put in a pit. Then\r\nhe broke out: “If I am tortured I shall deny all I have said now, and\r\nshall say all they want me to say. If the time be short, I can bear to\r\nbe beheaded, or to die by boiling water, or by fire, for the honour of\r\nthe order; but I can no longer withstand the torments which, for more\r\nthan two years, I have endured in prison.”[177]\r\n\r\n“I have been tortured three times,” said Humbert de Podio. “I was\r\nconfined thirty-six weeks in a tower, on bread and water, quia non\r\nconfitebatur quae volebant.”[178] Bernard de Vado showed two bones\r\nwhich had dropped from his heels after roasting his feet.[179]\r\n\r\nSuch testimony was disregarded, for condemnation was necessary as a\r\npreliminary to confiscation. The suppression of the Temple was the\r\nfirst step in that long spoliation of the Church which has continued\r\nto the present day, and which has been agonizing to the victims in\r\nproportion to their power of resistance. The fourteenth century was\r\nstill an age of faith, and the monks died hard. Philip grasped the\r\nsituation with the intuition of genius, and provided himself with an\r\ninstrument fit for the task before him. He forced Clement to raise\r\nPhilip de Marigni to the See of Sens, and Marigni was a man who shrank\r\nfrom nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen made archbishop, he convoked a provincial council at Paris, and\r\ncondemned, as relapsed heretics, the knights who had repudiated their\r\nconfessions. Fifty-nine of these knights belonged to his own diocese.\r\nHe had them brought to a fenced enclosure in a field near the Abbey\r\nof Saint Antoine, and there offered them pardon if they would recant.\r\nThen they were chained to stakes, and slowly burned to ashes from the\r\nfeet upward. Not one flinched, but amidst shrieks of anguish, when half\r\nconsumed, they protested their innocence, and died imploring mercy of\r\nChrist and of the Virgin.[180]\r\n\r\nDevotion so superb might have fired the imagination of even such a\r\ncraven as Clement, but Philip was equal to the emergency. He had\r\ncaused scores of witnesses to be examined to prove that Boniface\r\nwas a murderer, a sorcerer, a debauchee, and a heretic. Suddenly he\r\noffered to drop the prosecution, and to restore the Temple lands to\r\nthe Church, if the order might be abolished and the process closed.\r\nClement yielded. In October, 1311, the council met at Vienne. The\r\nwinter was spent in intimidation and bribery; the second meeting was\r\nnot held until the following April, and then the decree of suppression\r\nwas published. By this decree the corporation was dissolved, but\r\ncertain of the higher officers still lived, and in an evil moment\r\nClement bethought him of their fate. In December, 1313, he appointed\r\na commission to try them. They were brought before a lofty scaffold at\r\nthe portal of the Cathedral of Paris, and there made to reiterate the\r\navowals which had been wrung from them in their dungeons. Then they\r\nwere sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. But at this supreme moment,\r\nwhen it seemed that all was over, de Molay, the grand-master, and the\r\nMaster of Normandy, broke into a furious defence. The commissioners\r\nadjourned in a panic, but Philip, thirsting for blood, sprang upon his\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nHe gave his orders to his own officers, without consulting any prelate.\r\nOn March 18, 1314, as night fell, the two crusaders were taken from\r\nthe provost, who acted as their gaoler, and carried to a little island\r\nin the Seine, on which a statue of Henry of Navarre now stands. There\r\nthey were burned together, without a trial and without a sentence.\r\nThey watched the building of their funeral pile with “hearts so firm\r\nand resolute, and persisted with such constancy in their denials to\r\nthe end, and suffered death with such composure, that they left the\r\nwitnesses of their execution in admiration and stupor.”[181]\r\n\r\nAn ancient legend told how de Molay, as he stood upon his blazing\r\nfagots, summoned Clement to meet him before God’s judgment-seat in\r\nforty days, and Philip within a year. Neither survived the interval.\r\nPhilip had promised to restore the goods of the Temple to the Church,\r\nbut the plunder, for which this tremendous deed was done, was not\r\nsurrendered tamely to the vanquished after their defeat. The gold\r\nand silver, and all that could be stolen, disappeared. The land was\r\nin the end ceded to the Hospital, but so wasted that, for a century,\r\nno revenue whatever accrued from what had been one of the finest\r\nconventual estates in Europe.[182]\r\n\r\nSuch was the opening of that social revolution which, when it reached\r\nits height, was called the Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH REFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nMany writers have pointed out the relation between commerce and\r\nscepticism in the Middle Ages, and, among others, Thorold Rogers has a\r\npassage in his _History of Agriculture and Prices_ so interesting that\r\nit should be read entire:--\r\n\r\n   “The general spread of Lollardy, about which all the\r\n    theologians of the age complain, was at once the cause anti the\r\n    effect of progressive opulence. It cannot be by accident that\r\n    all the wealthiest parts of Europe, one district only excepted,\r\n    and that for very sufficient reasons, were suspected during the\r\n    Middle Ages of theological nonconformity. Before the campaigns\r\n    of Simon de Montfort, in the first half of the thirteenth\r\n    century, Provence was the garden and workshop of Europe. The\r\n    sturdiest advocates of the Reformation were the burghers of the\r\n    Low Countries.... In England the strength of the Lollard party\r\n    was, from the days of Wiklif to the days of Cranmer, in Norfolk\r\n    [the principal manufacturing county]; and I have no doubt that\r\n    ... the presence of students from this district must have told\r\n    on the theological bias of Cambridge University, which came out\r\n    markedly at the epoch of the Reformation....\r\n\r\n   “English Lollardy was, like its direct descendant Puritanism,\r\n    sour and opinionative, but it was also moral and thrifty.\r\n    They who denounced the lazy and luxurious life of the monks,\r\n    the worldliness and greed of the prelates, and the gross and\r\n    shallow artifices of the popular religion, were pretty sure\r\n    to inculcate parsimony and saving. By voluntarily and sturdily\r\n    cutting themselves off from the circumstance of the old faith,\r\n    they were certain, like the Quakers of more than two centuries\r\n    later, to become comparatively wealthy. They had nothing to\r\n    spare for monk or priest....”[183]\r\n\r\nThe Lollards were of the modern economic type, and discarded the\r\nmiracle because the miracle was costly and yielded an uncertain\r\nreturn. Yet the mediæval cult was based upon the miracle, and many of\r\nthe payments due for the supernatural services of the ecclesiastics\r\nwere obligatory; beside, gifts as an atonement for sin were a drain\r\non savings, and the economist instinctively sought cheaper methods of\r\npropitiation.\r\n\r\nIn an age as unscientific as the sixteenth century, the conviction\r\nof the immutability of natural laws was not strong enough to admit\r\nof the abrogation of religious formulas. The monied class, therefore,\r\nproceeded step by step, and its first experiment was to suppress all\r\nfees to middle-men, whether priests or saints, by becoming their own\r\nintercessors with the Deity.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Witherspoon has observed, “fear of wrath from the avenger\r\nof blood” made men “fly to the city of refuge”;[184] but, as the\r\ntradesman replaced the enthusiast, a dogma was evolved by which\r\nmental anguish, which cost nothing, was substituted for the offering\r\nwhich was effective in proportion to its money value. This dogma was\r\n“Justification by Faith,” the corner-stone of Protestantism.\r\n\r\nFar from requiring an outlay from the elect, “Justification by Faith”\r\ndiscouraged it. The act consisted in “a deep humiliation of mind,\r\nconfession of guilt and wretchedness ... and acceptance of pardon and\r\npeace through Christ Jesus, which they have neither contributed to\r\nthe procuring, nor can contribute to the continuance of, by their own\r\nmerit.”[185]\r\n\r\nYet the substitution of a mental condition for a money payment, led to\r\nconsequences more far-reaching than the suppression of certain clerical\r\nrevenues, for it involved the rejection of the sacred tradition which\r\nhad not only sustained relic worship, but which had made the Church the\r\nchannel of communication between Christians and the invisible world.\r\n\r\nThat ancient channel once closed, Protestants had to open another,\r\nand this led to the deification of the Bible, which, before the\r\nReformation, had been supposed to derive its authority from that divine\r\nillumination which had enabled the priesthood to infallibly declare the\r\ncanon of the sacred books. Calvin saw the weak spot in the position of\r\nthe reformers, and faced it boldly. He maintained the Scripture to be\r\n“self-authenticated, carrying with it its own evidence, and ought not\r\nto be made the subject of demonstration and arguments from reason,”\r\nand that it should obtain “the same complete credit and authority\r\nwith believers ... as if they heard the very words pronounced by God\r\nhimself.”[186]\r\n\r\nThus for the innumerable costly fetishes of the imaginative age were\r\nsubstituted certain writings, which could be consulted without a fee.\r\nThe expedient was evidently the device of a mercantile community, and\r\nthe saving to those who accepted it enormous, but it disintegrated\r\nChristendom, and made an organized priesthood impossible. When each\r\nindividual might pry into the sacred mysteries at his pleasure, the\r\nauthority of the clergy was annihilated.\r\n\r\nMen of the priestly type among the reformers saw the danger and tried\r\nto save themselves. The thesis which the early evangelical divines\r\nmaintained was the unity of truth. The Scriptures were true: therefore\r\nif the whole body of Christians searched aright they could not fail to\r\ndraw truth from them, and this truth must be the creed of the universal\r\nChurch. Zwingli thus explained the doctrine:--\r\n\r\n   “Whoever hears the holy scriptures read aloud in church, judges\r\n    what he hears. Nevertheless what is heard is not itself the\r\n    Word through which we believe. For if we believed through the\r\n    simple hearing or reading of the Word, all would be believers.\r\n    On the contrary, we see that many hear and see and do not\r\n    believe. Hence it is clear that we believe only through the\r\n    word which the Heavenly Father speaks in our hearts, by which\r\n    he enlightens us so that we see, and draws us so that we\r\n    follow.... For God is not a God of strife and quarrel, but of\r\n    unity and peace. Where there is true faith, there the Holy\r\n    Spirit is present; but where the Holy Spirit is, there is\r\n    certainly effort for unity and peace.... Therefore there is no\r\n    danger of confusion in the Church since, if the congregation is\r\n    assembled through God, he is in the midst of them, and all who\r\n    have faith strive after unity and peace.”[187]\r\n\r\nThe inference the clergy sought to draw was, that though all could\r\nread the Bible, only the enlightened could interpret it, and that\r\nthey alone were the enlightened. Hence Calvin’s pretensions equalled\r\nHildebrand’s:--\r\n\r\n   “This is the extent of the power with which the pastors of the\r\n    Church, by whatever name they may be distinguished, ought to\r\n    be invested; that by the word of God they may venture to do\r\n    all things with confidence; may constrain all the strength,\r\n    glory, wisdom, and pride of the world to obey and submit to\r\n    his majesty; supported by his power, may govern all mankind,\r\n    from the highest to the lowest; may build up the house of\r\n    Christ, and subvert the house of Satan; may feed the sheep, and\r\n    drive away the wolves; may instruct and exhort the docile; may\r\n    reprove, rebuke, and restrain the rebellious and obstinate; may\r\n    bind and loose; may discharge their lightnings and thunders, if\r\n    necessary; but all in the Word of God.”[188]\r\n\r\nIn certain regions, poor and remote from the centres of commerce, these\r\npretensions were respected. In Geneva, Scotland, and New England, men\r\nlike Calvin, Knox, and Cotton maintained themselves until economic\r\ncompetition did its work: then they passed away. Nowhere has faith\r\nwithstood the rise of the mercantile class. As a whole the Reformation\r\nwas eminently an economic phenomenon, and is best studied in England,\r\nwhich, after the Reformation, grew to be the centre of the world’s\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of modern history, commerce and scepticism have gone\r\nhand in hand. The Eastern trade began to revive after the reopening of\r\nthe valley of the Danube, about 1000, and perhaps, in that very year,\r\nBerenger, the first great modern heretic, was born. By 1050 he had\r\nbeen condemned and made to recant, but with the growth of the Fairs\r\nof Champagne his heresy grew, and in 1215, just in the flush of the\r\ncommunal development, the Church found it necessary to define the dogma\r\nof transubstantiation, and declare it an article of faith. A generation\r\nlater came the burning of schismatics; in 1252, by his bull “Ad\r\nextirpanda,” Innocent IV. organized the Inquisition, and the next year\r\nGrossetête, Bishop of Lincoln, died, with whom the organized opposition\r\nof the English to the ancient costly ritual may be said to have opened.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the agitation for reform appears to have been\r\npractical from the outset. There was no impatience with dogmas simply\r\nbecause they were incomprehensible: the Trinity and the Double\r\nProcession were always accepted. Formulas of faith were resisted\r\nbecause they involved a payment of money, and foremost among these were\r\nmasses and penances. Another grievance was the papal patronage, and,\r\nas early as the fourteenth century, Parliament passed the statutes of\r\nprovisors and præmunire to prevent the withdrawal of money from the\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Lollards was an organized movement to resist\r\necclesiastical exactions, and to confiscate ecclesiastical property;\r\nand, if 1345 be taken as the opening of Wickliffe’s active life, the\r\nagitation for the seizure of monastic estates started just a generation\r\nafter Philip’s attack on the Temple in France. There was at least this\r\ndifference in the industrial condition of the two nations, and probably\r\nmuch more.\r\n\r\nWickliffe was rather a politician than a theologian, and his preaching\r\na diatribe against the extravagance of the Church. In one of his\r\nSaints’ Days sermons he explained the waste of relic worship as\r\nshrewdly as a modern man of business:--\r\n\r\n   “It would be to the benefit of the Church, and to the honour\r\n    of the saints, if the costly ornaments so foolishly lavished\r\n    upon their graves were divided among the poor. I am well\r\n    aware, however, that the man who would sharply and fully expose\r\n    this error would be held for a manifest heretic by the image\r\n    worshippers and the greedy people who make gain of such graves;\r\n    for in the adoration of the eucharist, and such worshipping of\r\n    dead bodies and images, the Church is seduced by an adulterous\r\n    generation.”[189]\r\n\r\nThe laity paid the priesthood fees because of their supernatural\r\npowers, and the possession of these powers was chiefly demonstrated by\r\nthe miracle of the mass. Wickliffe, with a leader’s eye, saw where the\r\nenemy was vulnerable, and the last years of his life were passed in his\r\nfierce controversy with the mendicants upon transubstantiation. Even at\r\nthat early day he presented the issue with incomparable clearness: “And\r\nthou, then, that art an earthly man, by what reason mayst thou say that\r\nthou makest thy maker?”[190]\r\n\r\nThe deduction from such premises was inexorable. The mass had to be\r\ncondemned as fetish worship, and with it went the adoration of relics.\r\n\r\n   “Indeed, many nominal Christians are worse than pagans; for it\r\n    is not so bad that a man should honour as God, for the rest\r\n    of the day, the first thing he sees in the morning, as that\r\n    regularly that accident should be really his God, which he\r\n    sees in the mass in the hands of the priest in the consecrated\r\n    wafer.”[191]\r\n\r\nWickliffe died December 30, 1384, and ten years later the Lollards\r\nhad determined to resist all payments for magic. They presented\r\ntheir platform to Parliament in 1395, summed up in their _Book of\r\nConclusions_. Some of these “conclusions” are remarkably interesting:--\r\n\r\n    5th.--“That the exorcisms and hallowings, consecrations and\r\n    blessings, over the wine, bread, wax, water, oil, salt,\r\n    incense, the altar-stone, and about the church-walls, over the\r\n    vestment, chalice, mitre, cross, and pilgrim-staves, are the\r\n    very practices of necromancy, rather than of sacred divinity.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n    7th.--“We mightily affirm ... that spiritual prayers made in the\r\n    church for the souls of the dead ... is a false foundation of\r\n    alms, whereupon all the houses of alms in England are falsely\r\n    founded.\r\n\r\n    8th.--“That pilgrimages, prayers, and oblations made unto blind\r\n    crosses or roods, or to deaf images made either of wood or\r\n    stone, are very near of kin unto idolatry.”[192]\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Cobham, the head of the Lollard party, was tried for heresy\r\nin 1413, Archbishop Arundel put him four test questions. First, whether\r\nhe believed, after the sacramental words had been spoken, any material\r\nbread or wine remained in the sacrament; fourth, whether he believed\r\nrelic worship meritorious.\r\n\r\nHis answers did not give satisfaction, and they roasted him in chains,\r\nin Saint Giles’s Fields, in 1418.\r\n\r\nA hundred years of high commercial activity followed Cobham’s death.\r\nThe discovery of America, and of the sea passage to India, changed\r\nthe channels of commerce throughout the world, human movement was\r\naccelerated, gunpowder made the attack overwhelming; centralization\r\ntook a prodigious stride, scepticism kept pace with centralization,\r\nand in 1510 Erasmus wrote thus, and yet remained in the orthodox\r\ncommunion:--\r\n\r\n   “Moreover savoureth it not of the same saulce [folly] (trow\r\n    ye) when everie countrey chalengeth a severall sainct for theyr\r\n    patrone, assignyng further to each sainct a peculiar cure and\r\n    office, with also sundrie ways of worshipping; as this sainct\r\n    helpeth for the tooth-ache, that socoureth in childbyrth; she\r\n    restoreth stolene goods; an other aydeth shipmen in tempests;\r\n    an other taketh charge of husbandmens hoggs; and so of the\r\n    rest; far too long were it to reherse all. Then some saincts\r\n    there be, that are generally sued for many thynges; amongst\r\n    whom chiefly is the virgin Mother of God, in whom vulgar folke\r\n    have an especiall confidence, yea almost more than in her\r\n    Sonne.”[193]\r\n\r\nWhen Erasmus wrote, the Reformation was at hand, but the attack\r\non Church property had begun in England full two centuries before,\r\ncontemporaneously with Philip’s onslaught on the Temple. All over\r\nEurope the fourteenth century was a period of financial distress; in\r\nFrance the communes became bankrupt and the coinage deteriorated, and\r\nin England the debasement of the currency began in 1299, and kept pace\r\nwith the rise of Lollardy. In 1299 the silver penny weighed 22 1⁄2\r\ngrains; Edward I. reduced it to 22 1⁄4 grains; Edward III. to 18\r\ngrains; Henry IV. to 15 grains; and Henry VI., during his restoration\r\nin 1470, to 12 grains.\r\n\r\nAs the stringency increased, the attack on the clergy gained in\r\nferocity. Edward I. not only taxed the priesthood, but seized the\r\nrevenues of the alien priories; of these there might have been one\r\nhundred and fifty within the realm, and what he took from them he spent\r\non his army.\r\n\r\nEdward II. and Edward III. followed the precedent, and during the\r\nlast reign, when the penny dropped four grains, these revenues were\r\nsequestered no less than twenty-three years. Under Henry IV. the penny\r\nlost three grains, and what remained of the income of these houses was\r\npermanently applied to defraying the expenses of the court. Henry V.\r\ndissolved them, and vested their estates in the crown.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry IV., when the penny was on the point of losing\r\nthree grains of its silver, the tone of Parliament was similar to that\r\nof the parliaments of the Reformation. On one occasion the king asked\r\nfor a subsidy, and the Speaker suggested that without burdening the\r\nlaity he might “supply his occasions by seizing on the revenues of the\r\nclergy”;[194] and in 1410 Lord Cobham anticipated the Parliament of\r\n1536 by introducing a bill for the confiscation of conventual revenues\r\nto the amount of 322,000 marks, a sum which he averred represented\r\nthe income of certain corporations whose names he appended in a\r\nschedule.[195]\r\n\r\nYear by year, as society consolidated, the economic type was\r\npropagated; and, as the pressure of a contracting currency stimulated\r\nthese men to action, the demand for cheap religion grew fiercer.\r\nLondon, the monied centre, waxed hotter and hotter, and a single\r\npassage from the _Supplicacyon for Beggers_ shows how bitter the\r\ndenunciations of the system of paying for miracles became:--\r\n\r\n   “Whate money pull they yn by probates of testamentes, priuy\r\n    tithes, and by mennes offeringes to theyre pilgrimages, and at\r\n    theyre first masses? Euery man and childe that is buried, must\r\n    pay sumwhat for masses and diriges to be song for him, or elles\r\n    they will accuse the dedes frendes and executours of heresie.\r\n    whate money get they by mortuaries, by hearing of confessions\r\n    ... by halowing of churches, altares, superaltares, chapelles,\r\n    and bells, by cursing of men and absoluing theim agein for\r\n    money?”[196]\r\n\r\nOne of the ballads of Cromwell’s time ridiculed, in this manner, all\r\nthe chief pilgrimages of the kingdom:--\r\n\r\n   “Ronnying hyther and thyther,\r\n    We cannot tell whither,\r\n      In offryng candels and pence\r\n    To stones and stockes,\r\n    And to olde rotten blockes,\r\n      That came, we know not from whense.\r\n\r\n   “To Walsyngham a gaddyng,\r\n    To Cantorbury a maddyng,\r\n      As men distraught of mynde;\r\n    With fewe clothes on our backes,\r\n    But an image of waxe,\r\n       For the lame and for the blynde.\r\n\r\n   “Yet offer what ye wolde,\r\n    Were it otes, syluer, or golde\r\n      Pyn, poynt, brooche, or rynge,\r\n    The churche were as then,\r\n    Such charitable men,\r\n      That they would refuse nothyng.”[197]\r\n\r\nBut the war was not waged with words alone. At the comparatively\r\nearly date of 1393, London had grown so unruly that Richard assumed\r\nthe government of the city himself. First he appointed Sir Edward\r\nDarlington warden, but Sir Edward proving too lenient, he replaced him\r\nwith Sir Baldwin Radington. Foxe, very frankly, explained why:--\r\n\r\n   “For the Londoners at that time were notoriously known to be\r\n    favourers of Wickliff’s side, as partly before this is to be\r\n    seen, and in the story of Saint Alban’s more plainly doth\r\n    appear, where the author of the said history, writing upon\r\n    the fifteenth year of King Richard’s reign, reporteth in these\r\n    words of the Londoners, that they were ‘not right believers in\r\n    God, nor in the traditions of their forefathers; sustainers\r\n    of the Lollards, depravers of religious men, withholders of\r\n    tithes, and impoverishers of the common people.’\r\n\r\n   “... The king, incensed not a little with the complaint of the\r\n    bishops, conceived eftsoons, against the mayor and sheriffs,\r\n    and against the whole city of London, a great stomach;\r\n    insomuch, that the mayor and both the sheriffs were sent for,\r\n    and removed from their office.”[198]\r\n\r\nBy the opening of the sixteenth century a priest could hardly collect\r\nhis dues without danger; the Bishop of London indeed roundly declared\r\nto the government that justice could not be had from the courts.\r\n\r\nIn 1514 the infant child of a merchant tailor named Hun died, and the\r\nparson of the parish sued the father for a bearing sheet, which he\r\nclaimed as a mortuary. Hun contested the case, and got out a writ of\r\npræmunire against the priest, which so alarmed the clergy that the\r\nchancellor of the diocese accused him of heresy, and confined him in\r\nthe Lollard’s tower of Saint Paul’s.\r\n\r\nIn due time the usual articles were exhibited against the defendant,\r\ncharging that he had disputed the lawfulness of tithes, and had said\r\nthey were ordained “only by the covetousness of priests”; also that he\r\npossessed divers of “Wickliff’s damnable works,” and more to the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nUpon these articles Fitzjames, Bishop of London, examined Hun on\r\nDecember 2, and after the examination recommitted him. On the morning\r\nof the 4th, a boy sent with his breakfast found him hanging to a\r\nbeam in his cell. The clergy said suicide, but the populace cried\r\nmurder, and the coroner’s jury found a verdict against Dr. Horsey, the\r\nchancellor. The situation then became grave, and Fitzjames wrote to\r\nWolsey a remarkable letter, which showed not only high passion, but\r\nserious alarm:--\r\n\r\n   “In most humble wise I beseech you, that I may have the king’s\r\n    gracious favour ... for assured am I, if my chancellor be tried\r\n    by any twelve men in London, they be so maliciously set, ‘in\r\n    favorem hæreticæ pravitatis,’ that they will cast and condemn\r\n    any clerk, though he were as innocent as Abel.”[199]\r\n\r\nThe evidence is conclusive that, from the outset, industry bred\r\nheretics; agriculture, believers. Thorold Rogers has explained that the\r\neast of England, from Kent to the Wash and on to Yorkshire, was the\r\nrichest part of the kingdom,[200] and Mr. Blunt, in his _Reformation\r\nof the Church of England_, has published an analysis of the martyrdoms\r\nunder Mary. He has shown that out of 277 victims, 234 came from the\r\ndistrict to the east of a line drawn from Boston to Portsmouth.\r\nWest of this line Oxford had most burnings; but, by the reign of\r\nMary, manufactures had spread so far inland that the industries\r\nof Oxfordshire were only surpassed by those of Middlesex.[201] In\r\nWickliffe’s time Norwich stood next to London, and Norwich was infested\r\nwith Lollards, many of whom were executed there.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, but two executions are recorded in the six\r\nagricultural counties north of the Humber--counties which were\r\nthe poorest and the farthest removed from the lines of trade. Thus\r\nthe eastern counties were the hot-bed of Puritanism. There, Kett’s\r\nrebellion broke out under Edward VI.; there, Cromwell recruited his\r\nIronsides, and throughout this region, before the beginning of the\r\nReformation, assaults on relics were most frequent and violent. One of\r\nthe most famous of these relics was the rood of Dovercourt. Dovercourt\r\nis part of Harwich, on the Essex coast; Dedham lies ten miles inland,\r\non the border of Suffolk; and the description given by Foxe of the\r\nburning of the image of Dovercourt, is an example of what went on\r\nthroughout the southeast just before the time of the divorce:--\r\n\r\n   “In the same year of our Lord 1532, there was an idol named\r\n    the Rood of Dovercourt, whereunto was much and great resort\r\n    of people: for at that time there was great rumour blown\r\n    abroad amongst the ignorant sort, that the power of the idol\r\n    of Dovercourt was so great, that no man had power to shut\r\n    the church-door where he stood; and therefore they let the\r\n    church-door, both night and day, continually stand open, for\r\n    the more credit unto their blind rumour. This once being\r\n    conceived in the heads of the vulgar sort, seemed a great\r\n    marvel unto many men; but to many again, whom God had blessed\r\n    with his spirit, it was greatly suspected, especially unto\r\n    these, whose names here follow: as Robert King of Dedham,\r\n    Robert Debnam of Eastbergholt, Nicholas Marsh of Dedham, and\r\n    Robert Gardner of Dedham, whose consciences were sore burdened\r\n    to see the honour and power of the almighty living God so to be\r\n    blasphemed by such an idol. Wherefore they were moved by the\r\n    Spirit of God, to travel out of Dedham in a wondrous goodly\r\n    night, both hard frost and fair moonshine, although the night\r\n    before, and the night after, were exceeding foul and rainy. It\r\n    was from the town of Dedham, to the place where the filthy Rood\r\n    stood, ten miles. Notwithstanding, they were so willing in that\r\n    their enterprise, that they went these ten miles without pain,\r\n    and found the church door open, according to the blind talk of\r\n    the ignorant people: for there durst no unfaithful body shut\r\n    it. This happened well for their purpose, for they found the\r\n    idol, which had as much power to keep the door shut, as to keep\r\n    it open; and for proof thereof, they took the idol from his\r\n    shrine, and carried him quarter of a mile from the place where\r\n    he stood, without any resistance of the said idol. Whereupon\r\n    they struck fire with a flint-stone, and suddenly set him on\r\n    fire, who burned out so brim, that he lighted them homeward one\r\n    good mile of the ten.\r\n\r\n   “This done, there went a great talk abroad that they should\r\n    have great riches in that place; but it was very untrue; for\r\n    it was not their thought or enterprise, as they themselves\r\n    afterwards confessed, for there was nothing taken away but his\r\n    coat, his shoes, and the tapers. The tapers did help to burn\r\n    him, the shoes they had again, and the coat one Sir Thomas Rose\r\n    did burn; but they had neither penny, halfpenny, gold, groat,\r\n    nor jewel.\r\n\r\n   “Notwithstanding, three of them were afterwards indicted of\r\n    felony, and hanged in chains within half a year, or thereabout.\r\n\r\n        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n   “The same year, and the year before, there were many images\r\n    cast down and destroyed in many places: as the image of the\r\n    crucifix in the highway by Coggeshall, the image of Saint\r\n    Petronal in the church of Great Horksleigh, the image of Saint\r\n    Christopher by Sudbury, and another image of Saint Petronal in\r\n    a chapel of Ipswich.”[202]\r\n\r\nEngland’s economic supremacy is recent, and has resulted from the\r\nchange in the seat of exchanges which followed the discovery of\r\nAmerica and the sea-route to India; long before Columbus, however, the\r\nintroduction of the mariner’s compass had altered the paths commerce\r\nfollowed between the north and south of Europe during the crusades.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of travel by land built up the Fairs of Champagne; they\r\ndeclined when safe ocean navigation had cheapened marine freights. Then\r\nAntwerp and Bruges superseded Provins and the towns of Central France,\r\nand rapidly grew to be the distributing points for Eastern merchandise\r\nfor Germany, the Baltic, and England. In 1317 the Venetians organized\r\na direct packet service with Flanders, and finally, the discoveries\r\nof Vasco-da-Gama, at the end of the fifteenth century, threw Italy\r\ncompletely out of the line of the Asiatic trade.\r\n\r\nBritish industries seem to have sympathized with these changes, for\r\nweaving first assumed some importance under Edward I., although English\r\ncloth long remained inferior to continental. The next advance was\r\ncontemporaneous with the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope. On July 8,\r\n1497, Vasco-da-Gama sailed for Calicut, and in the previous year Henry\r\nVII. negotiated the “Magnus Intercursus,” by which treaty the Merchant\r\nAdventurers succeeded for the first time in establishing themselves\r\nadvantageously in Antwerp. Thenceforward England began to play a part\r\nin the industrial competition of Europe, but even then her progress was\r\npainfully slow. The accumulations of capital were small, and increased\r\nbut moderately, and a full century later, when the Dutch easily raised\r\n£600,000 for their East India Company, only £72,000 were subscribed in\r\nLondon for the English venture.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Middle Ages, while exchanges centred in North Italy,\r\nGreat Britain hung on the outskirts of the commercial system of the\r\nworld, and even at the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII. she could\r\nnot compare, either in wealth, refinement, or organization, with such a\r\nkingdom as France.\r\n\r\nThe crown had not been the prize of the strongest in a struggle among\r\nequals, but had fallen to a soldier of a superior race, under whom no\r\ngreat nobility ever grew up. No baron in England corresponded with such\r\nprinces as the dukes of Normandy and Burgundy, the counts of Champagne\r\nand Toulouse. Fortifications were on a puny scale; no strongholds like\r\nPierrefonds or Vitré, Coucy or Carcassonne existed, and the Tower of\r\nLondon itself was insignificant beside the Château Gaillard, which\r\nCœur-de-Lion planted on the Seine.\r\n\r\nThe population was scanty, and increased little. When Henry VIII. came\r\nto the throne in 1509, London may have had forty or fifty thousand\r\ninhabitants, York eleven thousand, Bristol nine or ten thousand, and\r\nNorwich six thousand.[203] Paris at that time probably contained\r\nbetween three and four hundred thousand, and Milan and Ghent two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand each.\r\n\r\nBut although England was not a monied centre during the Middle Ages,\r\nand perhaps for that very reason, she felt with acuteness the financial\r\npressure of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. She had little\r\ngold and silver, and gold and silver rose in relative value; she had\r\nfew manufactures, and manufactures were comparatively prosperous; her\r\nwealth lay in her agricultural interests, and farm products were, for\r\nthe most part, severely pinched.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the prices between the end of the thirteenth century and\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth, Mr. Rogers has observed:--\r\n\r\n   “Again, upon several articles of the first importance, there is\r\n    a marked decline in the price from the average of 1261–1400 to\r\n    that of 1401–1540. This would have been more conspicuous, if\r\n    I had in my earlier volumes compared all prices from 1261 to\r\n    1350 with those of 1351–1400. But even over the whole range,\r\n    every kind of grain, except wheat and peas, is dearer in the\r\n    thirteenth and fourteenth centuries than it is in the first\r\n    hundred and forty years of the present period [1401–1582];\r\n    and had I taken the average price of wheat during the last\r\n    fifty years of the fourteenth century, it would have been\r\n    (6s. 1 1⁄2d.) dearer than the average of 1401–1540 (5s.\r\n    11 3⁄4d.), heightened as this is by the dearness of the last\r\n    thirteen years.”[204]\r\n\r\nThe tables published by Mr. Rogers make it possible to form some idea\r\nof the strain to which the population of Great Britain was exposed,\r\nduring the two hundred and fifty years which intervened between the\r\ncrisis at the close of the thirteenth century, and the discovery of\r\nthe mines of Potosi in 1545, which flooded the world with silver.\r\nThroughout this long interval an expanding commerce unceasingly\r\nenlarged the demand for currency, while no adequate additions were made\r\nto the stock of the precious metals; the consequence was that their\r\nrelative value rose, while the value of commodities declined, and this\r\nprocess had a tendency to debase the coinage.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the Middle Ages was a time of rapid centralization,\r\nwhen the cost of administration grew from year to year but in\r\nproportion as the necessities of the government increased, the power\r\nof the people to pay taxes diminished, because the products which they\r\nsold brought less of the standard coin. To meet the deficit the same\r\nweight of metal had to be cut into more pieces, and thus by a continued\r\ninflation of the currency, general bankruptcy was averted. The various\r\nstages of pressure are pretty clearly marked by the records of the\r\nMint.\r\n\r\nApparently the stringency which began in France about the end of\r\nthe reign of Saint Louis, or somewhat later, did not affect England\r\nimmediately, for prices do not seem to have reached their maximum until\r\nafter 1290, and Edward I. only reduced the penny, in 1299, from 22.5\r\ngrains of silver to 22.25 grains. Thenceforward the decline, though\r\nspasmodic, on the whole tended to increase in severity from generation\r\nto generation. The long French wars, and the Black Death, produced a\r\nprofound effect upon the domestic economy of the kingdom under Edward\r\nIII.; and the Black Death, especially, seems to have had the unusual\r\nresult of raising prices at a time of commercial collapse. This rise\r\nprobably was due to the dearth of labour, for half the population of\r\nEurope is said to have perished, and, at all events, the crops often\r\ncould not be reaped through lack of hands. More than a generation\r\nelapsed before normal conditions returned.\r\n\r\nImmediately before the French war the penny lost two grains, and\r\nbetween 1346 and 1351, during the Black Death, it lost two grains and a\r\nquarter more, a depreciation of four grains and a half in fifty years;\r\nthen for half a century an equilibrium was maintained. Under Henry\r\nIV. there was a sharp decline of three grains, equal to an inflation\r\nof seventeen per cent, and by 1470, under Henry VI., the penny fell\r\nto twelve grains. Then a period of stability followed, which lasted\r\nuntil just before the Reformation, when a crisis unparalleled in\r\nseverity began, a crisis which probably was the proximate cause of the\r\nconfiscation of the conventual estates.\r\n\r\nIn 1526 the penny suddenly lost a grain and a half, or about twelve and\r\na half per cent, and then, when further reductions of weight would have\r\nmade the piece too flimsy, the government resorted to adulteration. In\r\n1542, a ten-grain penny was coined with one part in five of alloy; in\r\n1544, the alloy had risen to one-half, and in 1545, two-thirds of the\r\ncoin was base metal--a depreciation of more than seventy per cent in\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, though prices had fluctuated, the trend had been downward,\r\nand downward so strongly that it had not been fully counteracted by the\r\nreductions of bullion in the money. Rogers thought lath-nails perhaps\r\nthe best gauge of prices, and in commenting on the years which preceded\r\nthe Reformation, he remarked:--\r\n\r\n   “From 1461 to 1540, the average [of lath-nails] is very\r\n    little higher than it was from 1261 to 1350, illustrating\r\n    anew that significant decline in prices which characterizes\r\n    the economical history of England during the eighty years\r\n    1461–1540.”[205]\r\n\r\nAlthough wheat rose more than other grains, and is therefore an\r\nunfavourable standard of comparison, wheat yields substantially the\r\nsame result. During the last forty years of the thirteenth century,\r\nthe average price of the quarter was 5s. 10 3⁄4d., and for the last\r\ndecade, 6s. 1d. For the first forty years of the sixteenth century\r\nthe average was 6s. 10d. The penny of 1526, however, contained only\r\nabout forty-seven per cent of the bullion of the penny of 1299. “The\r\nmost remarkable fact in connection with the issue of base money by\r\nHenry VIII. is the singular identity of the average price of grain,\r\nespecially wheat, during the first 140 years of my present period, with\r\nthe last 140 of my first two volumes.”[206]\r\n\r\nAfter a full examination of his tables, Rogers concluded that the great\r\nrise which made the prosperity of Elizabeth’s reign did not begin until\r\nsome “year between 1545 and 1549.”[207] This corresponds precisely\r\nwith the discovery of Potosi in 1545, and that the advance was due\r\nto the new silver, and not to the debasement of the coinage, seems\r\ndemonstrated by the fact that no fall took place when the currency\r\nwas restored by Elizabeth, but, on the contrary, the upward movement\r\ncontinued until well into the next century.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed from these figures of the contraction which\r\nprevailed during the years of the Reformation. In 1544, toward the\r\nclose of Henry’s reign, the penny held five grains of pure silver as\r\nagainst about 20.8 grains in 1299, and yet its purchasing power had not\r\ngreatly varied. Bullion must therefore have had about four times the\r\nrelative value in 1544 that it had two hundred and fifty years earlier,\r\nand, if the extremely debased issues of 1545 and later be taken as the\r\nmeasure, its value was much higher.\r\n\r\nHad Potosi been discovered a generation earlier, the whole course of\r\nEnglish development might have been modified, for it is not impossible\r\nthat, without the aid of falling prices, the rising capitalistic class\r\nmight have lacked the power to confiscate the monastic estates. As\r\nit was, the pressure continued until the catastrophe occurred, relic\r\nworship was swept away, the property of the nation was redistributed,\r\nand an impulsion was given to large farming which led to the rapid\r\neviction of the yeomanry. As the yeomen were driven from their land,\r\nthey roamed over the world, colonizing and conquering, from the\r\nMississippi to the Ganges; building up, in the course of two hundred\r\nand fifty years, a centralization greater than that of Rome, and more\r\nabsolute than that of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nChanges so vast in the forms of competition necessarily changed\r\nthe complexion of society. Men who had flourished in an age of\r\ndecentralization and of imagination passed away, and were replaced by a\r\nnew aristocracy. The soldier and the priest were overpowered; and, from\r\nthe Reformation downward, the monied type possessed the world.\r\n\r\nThomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, was the ideal of this type, and he was\r\naccordingly the Englishman who rose highest during the convulsion of\r\nthe Reformation. He was a perfect commercial adventurer, and Chapuys,\r\nthe ambassador of Charles V. at London, thus described his origin to\r\nhis master:--\r\n\r\n   “Cromwell is the son of a poor farrier, who lived in a little\r\n    village a league and a half from here, and is buried in the\r\n    parish graveyard. His uncle, father of the cousin whom he\r\n    has already made rich, was cook of the late Archbishop of\r\n    Canterbury. Cromwell was ill-behaved when young, and after\r\n    an imprisonment was forced to leave the country. He went to\r\n    Flanders, Rome, and elsewhere in Italy. When he returned he\r\n    married the daughter of a shearman, and served in his house; he\r\n    then became a solicitor.”[208]\r\n\r\nThe trouble which drove him abroad seems to have been with his\r\nfather, and he probably started on his travels about 1504. He led\r\na dissolute and vagabond life, served as a mercenary in Italy, “was\r\nwild and youthful, ... as he himself was wont ofttimes to declare unto\r\nCranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury; showing what a ruffian he was in\r\nhis young days ... also what a great doer he was with Geffery Chambers\r\nin publishing and setting forth the pardons of Boston everywhere in\r\nchurches as he went.”[209]\r\n\r\nThese “pardons” were indulgences he succeeded in obtaining from the\r\npope for the town of Boston, which he peddled about the country as\r\nhe went. He served as a clerk in the counting house of the Merchant\r\nAdventurers at Antwerp, and also appears to have filled some such\r\nposition with a Venetian merchant. On his return to England in 1513,\r\nhe married and set up a fulling-mill; he also became an attorney and a\r\nusurer, dwelling by Fenchurch, in London.\r\n\r\nIn 1523, having been elected to Parliament, Cromwell was a most\r\nprosperous man. At this time he entered Wolsey’s service, and made\r\nhimself of use in suppressing convents to supply endowments for\r\nthe cardinal’s colleges at Oxford and Ipswich. When Wolsey fell, he\r\ningratiated himself with Henry, and thenceforward rose rapidly. He\r\nbecame chancellor of the exchequer, master of the rolls, secretary of\r\nstate, vicar general, a Knight of the Garter, and Earl of Essex. At\r\nonce the head of Church and State, probably no English subject has ever\r\nbeen so powerful.\r\n\r\nBoth he and Cranmer succeeded through flexibility and adroitness. He\r\nsuggested to Henry to accomplish his ends by robbing the convents, and\r\nMr. Brewer, an excellent authority, thought him notoriously venal from\r\nthe outset.\r\n\r\nHis executive and business capacity was unrivalled. He had the instinct\r\nfor money, and provided he made it, he scrupled not about the means. In\r\nthe _State Papers_ there is an amusing account of the treatment he put\r\nup with, when at the pinnacle of greatness:--\r\n\r\n   “And as for my Lord Prevye Sealle, I wold not be in his case\r\n    for all that ever he hathe, for the King beknaveth him twice\r\n    a weke, and some-tyme knocke him well about thee pate; and yet\r\n    when he hathe bene well pomeld aboute the hedde, and shaken up,\r\n    as it were a dogge, he will come out into the great chambre,\r\n    shaking of the bushe with as mery a countenance as thoughe he\r\n    mought rule all the roste.”[210]\r\n\r\nThough good-natured where his interests were not involved, he appears\r\nto have been callous to the sight of pain, and not only attended to\r\nthe racking of important witnesses, but went in state to see Father\r\nForest roasted in chains for denying the royal supremacy, which he was\r\nlabouring to establish. His behaviour to Lambert, whom he sent to the\r\nfire for confessing his own principles, astonished even those who knew\r\nhim well. How he became a Protestant is uncertain; Foxe thought, by\r\nreading Erasmus’s translation of the New Testament. More probably he\r\nwas sceptical because he was of the economic type. At all events, he\r\nhated Rome, and Foxe said that in 1538 he was “the chief friend of the\r\ngospellers.”\r\n\r\nIn that same year Lambert was tried for heresy regarding\r\ntransubstantiation, and it was then Cromwell sentenced him to be burned\r\nalive. Characteristically, he is said to have invited him to breakfast\r\non the morning of the execution, and to have then begged his pardon for\r\nwhat he had done.\r\n\r\nPole described a conversation he had with Essex about the duty of\r\nministers to kings. Pole thought their first obligation was to consider\r\ntheir masters’ honour, and insisted on the divergence between honour\r\nand expediency. Such notions seemed fantastic to Cromwell, who told\r\nPole that a prudent politician would study a prince’s inclinations and\r\nact accordingly. He then offered Pole a manuscript of Machiavelli’s\r\n_Prince_. Such a temperament differed, not so much in degree as in\r\nkind, from that of Godfrey de Bouillon or Saint Louis, Bayard or the\r\nBlack Prince. It was subtler, more acquisitive, more tenacious of\r\nlife, and men and women of the breed of Cromwell rose rapidly to be\r\nthe owners of England during the sixteenth century. Social standards\r\nchanged. Even in semi-barbarous ages a lofty courtesy had always\r\nbeen deemed befitting the great. Saint Anselm and Héloïse, Saladin\r\nand Cœur-de-Lion have remained ideals for centuries, because they\r\nrepresented a phase of civilization; and Froissart has described how\r\nthe Black Prince entertained his prisoners after Poitiers:--\r\n\r\n   “The prince himself served the king’s table, as well as the\r\n    others, with every mark of humility, and would not sit down\r\n    at it, in spite of all his entreaties for him so to do, saying\r\n    that ‘he was not worthy of such an honour, nor did it appertain\r\n    to him to seat himself at the table of so great a king, or of\r\n    so valiant a man as he had shown himself by his actions that\r\n    day.’”[211]\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty years of progress had eliminated chivalry.\r\nManners were coarse and morals loose at the court of Henry VIII.\r\nForeign ambassadors spoke with little respect of the society they saw.\r\nChapuys permitted himself to sneer at Lady Jane Seymour, who afterward\r\nbecame queen, because he seems to have thought the ladies of the court\r\nvenal:--\r\n\r\n   “I leave you to judge whether, being English, and having\r\n    frequented the court, ‘si elle ne tiendroit pas à conscience\r\n    de navoir pourveu et prévenu de savoir que cest de faire\r\n    nopces.’”[212]\r\n\r\nThe scandals of the Boleyn family are too well known to need\r\nnotice,[213] and it would be futile to accumulate examples of the\r\nabsence of female virtue when the fact is notorious. The rising\r\nnobility resembled Cromwell more or less feebly. The mercenary quality\r\nwas the salient characteristic of the favoured class. Thomas Boleyn,\r\nEarl of Wiltshire, made his fortune through his own shrewdness and the\r\nbeauty of his daughters. Mary, the younger, was an early mistress of\r\nHenry; Anne, the elder and the astuter, was his wife. Boleyn’s title\r\nand his fortune came through this connection. Boleyn was a specimen of\r\na class; in him the instinct of self-preservation was highly developed.\r\nWhen his daughter Anne, and his son, Lord Rochford, were tried at the\r\nTower for incest, the evidence was so flimsy that ten to one was bet\r\nin the court-room on acquittal. At this supreme moment, the attitude\r\nof the father was thus described by Chapuys, who had good sources of\r\ninformation:--\r\n\r\n   “On the 15th the said concubine and her brother were condemned\r\n    of treason by all the principal lords of England, and the Duke\r\n    of Norfolk [her uncle] pronounced sentence. I am told the Earl\r\n    of Wiltshire was quite as ready to assist at the judgment as he\r\n    had done at the condemnation of the other four.”[214]\r\n\r\nThe grandfather of Thomas Boleyn had been an alderman of London and\r\na rich tradesman; his son had been knighted, and had retired from\r\nbusiness, and Wiltshire himself, though a younger son and with but\r\nfifty pounds a year when married, raised himself by his wits, and the\r\nuse of his children, to be a wealthy earl.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Cecil family is not dissimilar. David, the first\r\nof the name who emerged from obscurity, gained a certain favour under\r\nHenry VIII.; his son Richard, a most capable manager, obtained a fair\r\nshare of the monastic plunder, was groom of the robes, constable of\r\nWarwick Castle, and died rich. His son was the great Lord Burleigh,\r\nin regard to whom perhaps it may be best to quote an impartial\r\nauthority. Macaulay described him as possessed of “a cool temper, a\r\nsound judgment, great powers of application, and a constant eye to\r\nthe main chance.... He never deserted his friends till it was very\r\ninconvenient to stand by them, was an excellent Protestant when it was\r\nnot very advantageous to be a Papist, recommended a tolerant policy\r\nto his mistress as strongly as he could recommend it without hazarding\r\nher favour, never put to the rack any person from whom it did not seem\r\nprobable that useful information might be derived, and was so moderate\r\nin his desires that he left only three hundred distinct landed estates,\r\nthough he might, as his honest servant assures us, have left much more,\r\n‘if he would have taken money out of the exchequer for his own use, as\r\nmany treasurers have done.’”[215]\r\n\r\nThe Howards, though of an earlier time, were of the same temperament.\r\nThe founder was a lawyer, who sat on the bench of the Common Pleas\r\nunder Edward I., and who, therefore, did not earn his knighthood on a\r\nstricken field, as the Black Prince won his spurs at Crécy. After his\r\ndeath his descendants made little stir for a century, but they married\r\nadvantageously, accumulated money, and, in the fifteenth century, one\r\nRobert Howard married a daughter of Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.\r\nThis he hardly would have done had he not been a man of substance,\r\nsince he seems not to have been a man of war. The alliance made the\r\nfortune of the family. It also appears to have added some martial\r\ninstinct to the stock, for Richard III. gave John Howard the title of\r\nthe Mowbrays, and this John was afterwards killed at Bosworth. His son\r\ncommanded at Flodden, and his grandson was the great spoiler of the\r\nconvents under Henry VIII., who also suppressed the northern rebellion.\r\n\r\nThomas Howard, the minister of Henry VIII., was one of the most\r\ninteresting characters of his generation. He was naturally a strong\r\nConservative; Chapuys never doubted that “the change in matters of\r\nreligion [was] not to his mind”: in 1534 he even went so far as to\r\ntell the French ambassador that he would not consent to a change, and\r\nthis speech having been repeated to the king, occasioned his momentary\r\ndisgrace.[216] At one time Lord Darcy, the head of the reactionary\r\nparty, counted on his support against Cromwell, though he warned\r\nChapuys not to trust him implicitly, because of “his inconstancy.”[217]\r\nYet, under a certain appearance of vacillation, he hid a profound\r\nand subtle appreciation of the society which environed him; this\r\n“inconstancy” made his high fortune. He had a sure instinct, which\r\ntaught him at the critical moment where his interests lay, and he never\r\nwas deceived. Henry distrusted him, but could not do without him, and\r\npaid high for his support. Howard, on his side, was keenly distressed\r\nwhen he found he had gone too far, and when the northern insurrection\r\nbroke out, and he was offered the command of the royal forces, the\r\nBishop of Carlisle, with whom he dined, said he had never seen the duke\r\n“so happy as he was to-day.”[218]\r\n\r\nOnce in the field against his friends, there were no lengths to which\r\nThomas Howard would not go. He never wearied of boasting of his lies\r\nand of his cruelty, he wrote to assure Henry he would spare no pains to\r\nentrap them, and would esteem no promise he made to the rebels, “for\r\nsurely I shall observe no part thereof, for any respect of that other\r\nmight call mine honor dystayned.”[219]\r\n\r\nAs Cromwell behaved toward Lambert, so he behaved toward the\r\nCarthusians. Though they were men in whose religion he probably\r\nbelieved as sincerely as he believed anything, and in whose cause he\r\nhad professed himself ready to take up arms, when they were sent to the\r\nstake he attended the execution as a spectacle, and watched them expire\r\nin torments, without a pang. Men gifted like Howard were successful\r\nin the Reformation, and Norfolk made a colossal fortune out of his\r\npolities. The price of his service was thirteen convents, and his son\r\nSurrey had two; of what he made in other ways no record remains.\r\n\r\nSuch was the new aristocracy; but the bulk of the old baronage was\r\ndifferently bred, and those who were of the antiquated type were doomed\r\nto pass away.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the _State Papers_ leaves no doubt that the ancient\r\nfeudal gentry, both titled and untitled, as a body, opposed the\r\nreform. Many of the most considerable of these were compromised in\r\nthe Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536, among whom was Thomas Lord Darcy. If\r\na mediæval baron still lived in the middle of the sixteenth century,\r\nthat man was Darcy. Since the Conqueror granted the Norman de Areci\r\nthirty lordships in Lincolnshire, his ancestors had been soldiers, and\r\nat his home in the north his retainers formed an army as of old. Born\r\nin 1467, at twenty-five he bound himself by indenture to serve Henry\r\nVII. beyond the sea, at the head of a thousand men, and more than forty\r\nyears afterward he promised Chapuys that he would march against London\r\nwith a force eight thousand strong, if the emperor would attack Henry\r\nVIII. All his life long he had fought upon the borders. He had been\r\ncaptain of Berwick, warden of the east and middle marches, and in 1511\r\nhe had volunteered to lead a British contingent against the Moors. He\r\nwas a Knight of the Garter, a member of the Privy Council, and when\r\nthe insurrection broke out, he commanded at Pontefract Castle, the\r\nstrongest position in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nA survival of the past, he retained the ideas of Crécy and Poitiers,\r\nand these brought him to the block. While negotiations were pending,\r\nNorfolk seems to have wanted to save him, though possibly he may have\r\nbeen actuated by a more sinister purpose. At all events he certainly\r\nwrote suggesting to Darcy to make his peace by ensnaring Aske, the\r\nrebel leader, and giving him up to the government. To Norfolk this\r\nseemed a perfectly legitimate transaction. By such methods he rose to\r\neminence. To Darcy it seemed dishonour, and he died for it. Instead of\r\ndoing as he was bid, he reproached Norfolk for deeming him capable of\r\ntreachery:--\r\n\r\n   “Where your lordship advises me to take Aske, quick or dead, as\r\n    you think I may do by policy, and so gain the king’s favour;\r\n    alays my good lord yt ever ye being a man of so much honour\r\n    and gret experyence shold advice or chuss mee a man to be of\r\n    eny such sortt or facion to betray or dissav eny liffyng man,\r\n    French man, Scott, yea, or a Turke; of my faith, to gett and\r\n    wyn to me and myn heyres fowr of the best dukes landdes in\r\n    Fraunce, or to be kyng there, I wold nott do it to no liffyng\r\n    person.”[220]\r\n\r\nDarcy averred that he surrendered Pontefract to the rebels because the\r\ngovernment neglected to relieve him, and although doubtless he always\r\nsympathized with the rising, he promptly wrote to London when the\r\noutbreak began, to warn Henry not only of the weakness of his fortress,\r\nbut of the power of the enemy.[221] When the royal herald visited\r\nthe castle to treat with the insurgents, he found Darcy, Sir Robert\r\nConstable, Aske, and others, who told him they were on a pilgrimage to\r\nLondon to have all the “vile blood put from” the Privy Council, “and\r\nnoble blood set up again,” and to make restitution for the wrongs done\r\nthe Church.[222]\r\n\r\nThis Aske was he whom Darcy refused to betray, but instead he offered\r\nto do all he could “as a true knight and subject” to pacify the\r\ncountry, and he did help to persuade the rebels to disperse on Henry’s\r\npromise of a redress of grievances. In the moment of peril both Darcy\r\nand Aske were pardoned and cajoled, but the rising monied type were not\r\nthe men to let the soldiers escape them, once they held them disarmed.\r\nEven while Henry was plotting the destruction of those to whom he had\r\npledged his word, Norfolk wrote from the north to Cromwell: “I have\r\nby policy brought him [Aske] to desire me to yeve him licence to ride\r\nto London, and have promised to write a letter ... which ... I pray\r\nyou take of the like sort as you did the other I wrote for Sir Thomas\r\nPercy. If neither of them both come never in this country again I think\r\nneither true nor honest men woll be sorry thereof, nor in likewise for\r\nmy Lord Darcy nor Sir Robert Constable.”[223] Percy and Constable, Aske\r\nand Darcy, all perished on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nDarcy and his like recognized that a new world had risen about them, in\r\nwhich they had no place. During his imprisonment in London, before his\r\nexecution, he was examined by Cromwell, and thus, almost with his dying\r\nwords, addressed the man who was the incarnation of the force that\r\nkilled him:--\r\n\r\n   “Cromwell, it is thou that art the very original and chief\r\n    causer of all this rebellion and mischief, and art likewise\r\n    causer of the apprehension of us that be noble men and dost\r\n    daily earnestly travail to bring us to our end and to strike\r\n    off our heads, and I trust that or thou die, though thou\r\n    wouldst procure all the noblemen’s heads within the realm to be\r\n    stricken off, yet shall there one head remain that shall strike\r\n    off thy head.”[224]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE SUPPRESSION OF THE CONVENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the apex of the new society stood Henry VIII., who, like Philip the\r\nFair, had many of the qualities which make a great religious reformer\r\nin an economic age. In reaching an estimate of his nature, however, the\r\nopinions of Englishmen are of no great value, since they are usually\r\ndistorted by prejudice. The best observers were the foreign ministers\r\nat his court, whose business was to collect information for their\r\ngovernments. At a time when there were no newspapers, these agents had\r\nto be accurate, and their despatches are trustworthy.\r\n\r\nCharles de Marillac was born in 1510. He belonged to an old family, and\r\nhad an unblemished reputation. He had no leaning against Protestants,\r\nfor he was disgraced by the Guise party. He was thirty when in London\r\nas ambassador of Francis I. After having been a year in England, he\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n   “This prince seems to me subject among other vices to three,\r\n    which certainly in a king may be called pests, of which the\r\n    first is, that he is so avaricious and covetous, that all the\r\n    riches of the world would not be sufficient to satisfy and\r\n    content his ambition.... From this proceeds the second evil and\r\n    pest, which is distrust and fear ... wherefore he ceaselessly\r\n    embrews his hands in blood, feeling in his mind doubt of those\r\n    about him, wishing to live without suspicion, which every day\r\n    augments.... And in part from these two evils proceeds the last\r\n    pest, which is levity and inconstancy; and partly also from the\r\n    temper of the nation, by which they have perverted the rights\r\n    of religion, of marriage, of honesty and honour, as if they\r\n    were wax, the which alloy can change itself into whatever forms\r\n    they wish.”[225]\r\n\r\nCruelty was one of Henry’s most salient traits, and was, perhaps, the\r\nfaculty by which he succeeded in imposing himself most strongly upon\r\nhis contemporaries. He not only murdered his wives, his ministers, and\r\nhis friends, but he pursued those who opposed him with a vindictiveness\r\nwhich appalled them. He was ingenious in devising torments.\r\n\r\nFriar Forest, whose crime was the denial of the royal supremacy, he\r\ncaused to be slowly roasted over a rood which he had fetched from Wales\r\non purpose. They “hanged [him] in Smithfield in chains, upon a gallows\r\nquick, by the middle and arm-holes, and fire was made under him, and\r\nso was he consumed and burned to death.”[226] Henry relished the idea\r\nof the show so much, that Chapuys thought him disappointed at not being\r\nable to attend with his whole court.\r\n\r\nHis way of dealing with the Carthusians was equally characteristic. The\r\nCarthusians were in the Church what Darcy was in the State: men of the\r\nold imaginative type, of austere life and ascetic habits, in whom still\r\nglowed the fiery enthusiasm of Hildebrand. They could not accept Henry\r\nas God’s viceregent upon earth. The three priors--Houghton, Webster,\r\nand Lawrence--were “ripped up in each other’s presence, their arms torn\r\noff, their hearts cut out and rubbed upon their mouths and faces.”[227]\r\n\r\nThree more were chained upright to posts, where they stood for fourteen\r\ndays, “without the possibility of stirring for any purpose whatever,\r\nheld fast by iron collars on their necks, arms, and thighs.”[228] Then\r\nthey were hanged and disembowelled.\r\n\r\nIn 1537, ten were still resolute. They were chained in Newgate like\r\nthe others, where, according to Stowe, nine “died ... with stink and\r\nmiserably smothered.” The tenth, who survived, was hanged.\r\n\r\nHad Henry been hampered, like Darcy, with scruples about honour, truth,\r\nor conscience, he too might have been undone. His power lay in his\r\ncapacity for doing what was needful for success. He enticed Aske to\r\nLondon, and, when he held him, slew him. He pardoned Darcy, and then\r\nsent him to Tower Hill.\r\n\r\nLacking force to crush the rebels, Norfolk, in the royal name, pacified\r\nthe people with pardon and promises of redress. They dispersed,\r\nthinking themselves safe. Henry ignored his pledges, risings followed;\r\nbut, when the country had been tranquillized and his army was again in\r\npeaceful possession, he thus instructed the Duke:--\r\n\r\n   “Our pleasure is, that ... you shal, in any wise, cause\r\n    suche dredfull execution to be doon upon a good nombre of\r\n    thinhabitauntes of every towne, village, and hamlet, that have\r\n    offended in this rebellion, aswell by the hanging of them uppe\r\n    in trees, as by the quartering of them, and the setting of\r\n    their heddes and quarters in every towne, greate and small, and\r\n    in al suche other places, as they may be a ferefull spectacle\r\n    to all other herafter, that wold practise any like mater:\r\n    whiche We requyre you to doo, without pitie or respecte,\r\n    according to our former letters; remembring that it shalbe\r\n    moche better, that these traitours shulde perishe in their\r\n    wilfull, unkynde, and traitorous folyes, thenne that so slendre\r\n    punishment shuld be doon upon them, as the dredde thereof shuld\r\n    not be a warning to others.”[229]\r\n\r\nNorfolk was after Henry’s pattern. The rebels were his friends--men\r\nwith whom he had pledged himself to act shortly before. But he had\r\nchosen his side, he had made his bargain, and he earned his pay. He\r\nwas never weary of boasting of his cruelty toward the defenceless\r\nyeomanry:--\r\n\r\n   “They shall be put to death in every town where they dwelt....\r\n    As many as chains of iron can be made for in this town and in\r\n    the country shall be hanged in them; the rest in ropes. Iron is\r\n    marvellous scarce.”\r\n\r\nHe tried his prisoners by court martial, for he dared not trust the\r\njuries. Many of the farmers declared they had been forced to join in\r\nthe insurrection through threats of violence, and these might have\r\nbeen acquitted. “They say I came out for fear of my life, or for fear\r\nof burning my houses and destroying of my wife and children.”[230] But\r\nwhere Henry and Norfolk were concerned there were no acquittals.\r\n\r\nIn the same way Henry destroyed his ministers when he had done with\r\nthem. Though Cromwell was sagacious, he was less crafty than Henry.\r\nJust before his fall the king made him Earl of Essex, and he lived\r\nin such complete ignorance of his fate that his disgrace fell like\r\na thunder-bolt. Marillac has described how one day, in the council\r\nchamber, Cromwell was arrested without warning, and “moved with\r\nindignation, he plucked his hat from his head and threw it wrathfully\r\nupon the ground, saying to Norfolk and to the rest of the council\r\nassembled, that this was his reward for his services to the king, ...\r\nadding that since he was so treated, he renounced all hope, and all he\r\nasked of the king his master ... was not to let him languish....”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Norfolk, having reproached him with all the villanies\r\ndone by him, tore from him the Order of Saint George, which he wore\r\nabout his neck; and the admiral, to show himself as much his enemy in\r\nadversity as he had been believed to be his friend in prosperity, undid\r\nhis garter.[231]\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view Henry’s vanity was a weakness, for it laid him\r\nopen to attack, and the diplomatic correspondence is filled with sneers\r\nlike this of Castillon’s: “Il n’oublye jamais sa grandeur et se taist\r\nde celle des autres.”[232] Probably nothing in English civilization\r\nhas ever equalled the adulation he exacted from his courtiers, and\r\nespecially from his bishops; yet even this vanity was a source of\r\nstrength, for it made him insensible to ridicule which would have\r\nunnerved Saint Louis.\r\n\r\nOn very scanty evidence, he caused his wife to be arraigned for incest,\r\nand during the trial appeared in public so gaily dressed, and after her\r\nconviction danced before the Court in such open delight, that Chapuys\r\nhimself was surprised:--\r\n\r\n   “There are still two English gentlemen detained on her account,\r\n    and it is suspected that there will be many more, because the\r\n    king has said he believed that more than 100 had to do with\r\n    her. You never saw prince or man who made greater show of his\r\n    horns or bore them more pleasantly.”[233]\r\n\r\nHis manners, like those of Cromwell and Norfolk, lacked the courtesy\r\nwhich distinguished men, even of his own generation, like Sir Thomas\r\nMore. He was gluttonous and self-indulgent, and, toward the end of his\r\nlife, so bloated as to be helpless. His habits were well understood at\r\nCourt, and suitors tried to approach him in the afternoon, when he was\r\ntipsy. Marillac thought his gormandizing would kill him:--\r\n\r\n   “There has been little doubt about the king, not so much for\r\n    the fever as for the trouble with the leg which he has had\r\n    which trouble seizes him very often because he is very gross,\r\n    and marvellously excessive in eating and drinking, so that\r\n    you often find him of a different purpose and opinion in the\r\n    morning from what you do after dinner.”[234]\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 1538, Castillon wrote:--\r\n\r\n   “Furthermore the king has had one of the fistulas on his legs\r\n    closed, and since ten or twelve days the humors, which have no\r\n    vent, have taken to stifling him, so much so, that he has been\r\n    some of the time speechless, the face all black, and in great\r\n    danger.”[235]\r\n\r\nThe most marked characteristic of the feudal aristocracy had been\r\npersonal courage; but as centralization advanced and a paid police\r\nremoved the necessity of self-defence, bravery ceased to be essential\r\nto success; Henry apparently was not courageous--certainly was not\r\ncourageous in regard to disease. When most infatuated with Anne Boleyn,\r\nshe fell ill of the sweating sickness; he fled at once, and wrote from\r\na distance to beg her to fear nothing, as “few or no women ... have\r\ndied of it.”[236] Marillac declared roundly that, in such matters, the\r\nking was “the most timid person one could know.”[237]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he was habitually so overbearing as to be brutal to\r\nthe weak. Lambert was a poor sectary, of whom he determined to make an\r\nexample. He therefore prepared a solemn function, at which he presided,\r\nassisted by the bishops and the other dignitaries of the realm. The\r\naccused, when brought before this tribunal, apparently showed some\r\nconfusion, and Foxe has left a striking description of how Henry tried\r\nto heighten this terror. Henry was dressed “all in white,” probably\r\nemblematic of his purity as the head of the Church, and his “look, his\r\ncruel countenance, and his brows bent into severity, did not a little\r\naugment this terror; plainly declaring a mind full of indignation, far\r\nunworthy such a prince, especially in such a matter, and against so\r\nhumble and obedient a subject.”[238]\r\n\r\nGifted with such qualities, Henry could not have failed to be a great\r\nreligious reformer at the opening of a great economic age. More\r\nthan five hundred years before, when society hung on the brink of\r\ndissolution, the Church sustained centralization by electing Hugh Capet\r\nking of France. A century later the armed pilgrimages to Palestine\r\nhad accelerated the social movement, and consolidation again began.\r\nGeneration by generation the rapidity of movement had increased,\r\ncommunication had been re-established between the East and West, the\r\nmariner’s compass and gunpowder had been introduced into Europe, the\r\nattack had mastered the defence, and as the forms of competition slowly\r\nchanged, capital accumulated, until, at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, wealth reached the point where it could lay the foundation of\r\nthe paid police, the crowning triumph of the monied class.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation was the victory of this class over the archaic type\r\nof man, and with the Reformation the old imaginative civilization\r\npassed away; but with all its power the monied intellect has certain\r\nweaknesses, and neither in ancient Rome nor modern England have\r\ncapitalists been soldiers. The Tudor aristocracy was not a martial\r\ncaste. Lacking physical force, this new nobility feared the ancient\r\nfarming population, whom they slowly exterminated; and they feared them\r\nwith reason, for from among the yeomanry Cromwell drew his Ironsides.\r\nTherefore one of the chief preoccupations of the Tudor nobility was to\r\ndevise means to hold this dangerous element in check, and as it could\r\nnot organize an army, it utilized the Church. The land-owners had other\r\npurposes for the priesthood than simply to rob it; they had also to\r\nenslave it, and Henry’s title to greatness lies in his having attained\r\nboth ends.\r\n\r\nHe not only plundered as no other man has plundered, but he succeeded\r\nin assuming the functions of God’s high priest, and becoming Christ’s\r\nvicar upon earth. Upon this point there can be no difference of\r\nopinion; not only are the formularies of the Church of England clear,\r\nbut Anglicans themselves admit it. Macaulay was of Henry’s communion;\r\nMacaulay is an historian whose opinion on such a point commands\r\nrespect, and Macaulay has summed up the position of Henry VIII. as the\r\nhead of the capitalistic hierarchy in these words:--\r\n\r\n   “What Henry and his favourite counsellors meant, at one time,\r\n    by the supremacy, was certainly nothing less than the whole\r\n    power of the keys. The king was to be the pope of his kingdom,\r\n    the vicar of God, the expositor of Catholic verity, the channel\r\n    of sacramental graces. He arrogated to himself the right of\r\n    deciding dogmatically what was orthodox doctrine and what was\r\n    heresy, of drawing up and imposing confessions of faith, and of\r\n    giving religious instruction to his people.\r\n\r\n   “He proclaimed that all jurisdiction, spiritual as well as\r\n    temporal, was derived from him alone, and that it was in his\r\n    power to confer episcopal authority, and to take it away....\r\n\r\n   “According to this system, as expounded by Cranmer, the king\r\n    was the spiritual as well as the temporal chief of the nation.\r\n    In both capacities his Highness must have lieutenants. As\r\n    he appointed civil officers to keep his seal, to collect\r\n    his revenues, and to dispense justice in his name, so he\r\n    appointed divines of various ranks to preach the gospel, and to\r\n    administer the sacraments. It was unnecessary that there should\r\n    be any imposition of hands. The king--such was the opinion\r\n    of Cranmer given in the plainest words,--might, in virtue of\r\n    authority derived from God, make a priest; and the priest so\r\n    made needed no ordination whatever.”[239]\r\n\r\nUnder the Tudors commerce and industry were yet in their infancy.\r\nGreat Britain still remained substantially agricultural, and capital\r\nprimarily sought investment in land. The enclosure of the commons and\r\nthe confiscations of the monastic estates, together formed a gigantic\r\nreal estate speculation, with which faith had little to do, and which\r\nwas possible only because force began to express itself through another\r\ntype of intellect than that which had been able to defend its property\r\nduring an imaginative age.\r\n\r\nThe commercial community always demanded cheap religion. Under Henry\r\nthey inclined toward Zwingli, under Elizabeth toward Calvin, under\r\nCharles they were Presbyterian; the gentry, on the contrary, were by\r\nnature conservative, and favoured orthodoxy as far as their interest in\r\nChurch plunder permitted them. Henry and Norfolk stood at the head of\r\nthis class; Norfolk’s conversion to Protestantism has been explained by\r\nChapuys, and Henry remained a bigot to his death.\r\n\r\n   “Shortly before he died, when about to communicate, as he\r\n    always did, under one kind, he rose up from his chair, and fell\r\n    on his knees to adore the body of our Lord. The Zwinglians who\r\n    were present said that his majesty, by reason of his bodily\r\n    weakness, might make his communion sitting in his chair. The\r\n    king’s answer was, ‘If I could throw myself down, not only on\r\n    the ground, but under the ground, I should not then think that\r\n    I gave honour enough to the most Holy Sacrament.’”[240]\r\n\r\nAs to Norfolk, Chapuys has left his opinion in very plain words:--\r\n\r\n   “He [Norfolk] has a good deal changed his tune, for it was he\r\n    alone [in] the Court who showed himself the best of Catholics,\r\n    and who favoured most the authority of the pope; but he\r\n    must act in this way not to lose his remaining influence,\r\n    which apparently does not extend much further than Cromwell\r\n    wishes.”[241]\r\n\r\nTo attain their end, the rising class, at whose head these two men\r\nstood, had to doubly despoil the Church in whose dogmas they believed.\r\nThey confiscated her lands to enrich themselves, and they suppressed\r\nher revenues to buy the support of the traders. Finally, their lack\r\nof physical force suggested to them the expedient of seizing on\r\nthe ecclesiastical organization and filling it with their servants,\r\nwho should teach the people the religious duty of submission to an\r\nauthority which distrusted an appeal to arms.\r\n\r\nAs Henry and Norfolk represented the landed magnates, so Cromwell\r\nrepresented the mercantile community; and when the alliance between\r\nthese two monied interests had been perfected, by the appointment\r\nof Cromwell as secretary of state, some time previous to April,\r\n1534, events moved with precision and rapidity. They crowned Anne\r\nBoleyn on June 1, 1533; in July the breach between the king and pope\r\nbecame irreparable; in November, 1534, Parliament declared Henry\r\n“Supreme Head” of the Church; and in the following winter the whole\r\nadministration, both civil and ecclesiastical, was concentrated in\r\nCromwell’s hands. He acted with astonishing energy.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1535 he set on foot a visitation, preparatory to\r\nthe dissolution of the convents, and Parliament passed the bill\r\nfor suppression the next February. Cromwell also, as vicar general,\r\npresided over the convocation of Canterbury, which made the first\r\nreformation of faith. This convocation met in June, 1536, only shortly\r\nbefore the Pilgrimage of Grace, and, under the fear of violence,\r\nHenry and the conservatives were reduced to silence. The evangelical\r\ninfluence for the moment held control, and the “Ten Articles,”\r\nthe foundation of the “Thirty-nine Articles,” together with the\r\n“Institution of a Christian Man,” which were produced, were a great\r\ndeparture from orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth article, the dogma of the “Supper” was made broad enough\r\nto include Lutherans, and in the sixth, image worship was condemned. On\r\nthe other hand, “Justification by Faith” began to assume the importance\r\nit must always hold in all really Protestant confessions. In one of his\r\nhomilies Cranmer, at a later time, showed the comparative futility of\r\ngood works:--\r\n\r\n   “A man must needs be nourished by good works; but first he\r\n    must have faith. He that doeth good deeds, yet without faith,\r\n    he hath no life. I can shew a man that by faith without works\r\n    lived, and came to heaven: but without faith never man had\r\n    life.”[242]\r\n\r\n   “Never had the Jews, in their most blindness, so many\r\n    pilgrimages unto images ... as hath been used in our time....\r\n    Keeping in divers places, as it were marts or markets of\r\n    merits; being full of their holy relics, images, shrines, and\r\n    works of overflowing abundance ready to be sold.... Holy cowls,\r\n    holy girdles, holy pardons, heads, holy shoes, holy rules, and\r\n    all full of holiness.... Which were so esteemed and abused to\r\n    the great prejudice of God’s glory and commandments, that they\r\n    were made most high and most holy things, whereby to attain to\r\n    the everlasting life, or remission of sin.”[243]\r\n\r\nThe anti-sacerdotal movement under Henry VIII. culminated in 1536 and\r\n1537, when the country rebelled, and the land-owners were in need of\r\nhelp from the towns. As long as the latter felt uncertain of their grip\r\non Church lands, the radical mercantile interest was permitted to mould\r\ndoctrine; but when Norfolk had triumphed in the north, and Aske and\r\nDarcy had been executed, a reaction set in. In November, 1538, Lambert\r\nwas burned for denying transubstantiation, and in 1539 the chapter in\r\nthe statute book[244] which followed that providing for the suppression\r\nof the mitred abbeys, re-established auricular confession, communion\r\nin one kind, private masses, and, in a word, strict orthodoxy, saving\r\nin the single tenet of the royal supremacy. To have conceded that would\r\nhave endangered property. Twelve months later the landed magnates felt\r\nstrong enough to discard the tradesmen; the alliance which had carried\r\nthrough the Reformation was dissolved, and Cromwell was beheaded.\r\n\r\nNever did pope enforce the worship of the miracle more savagely than\r\ndid Henry. By the act of the “Six Articles,” the denial of the miracle\r\nof the mass was punished by burning and forfeiture of goods, without\r\nthe privilege of abjuration. Purity of faith could not have been the\r\nideal of reformers.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently, Protestants have accepted the tradition that the\r\nconvents of England were suppressed by the revolt of a people, outraged\r\nby the disclosure of abominations perpetrated under the shelter\r\nof monasticism. Within a few years, the publication of the British\r\narchives has thrown a new and sombre light upon the Reformation. They\r\nseem to prove, beyond a doubt, that as Philip dealt with the Templars,\r\nso did Henry deal with all the religious orders of his realm.\r\n\r\nIn 1533 Henry’s position was desperate. He confronted not only the\r\npope and the emperor, but all that remained of the old feudal society,\r\nand all that survived of the decaying imaginative age. Nothing could\r\nresist this combination save the rising power of centralized capital,\r\nand Henry therefore had to become the mouthpiece of the men who gave\r\nexpression to this force.\r\n\r\nHe needed money, and money in abundance, and Cromwell rose to a\r\npractical dictatorship because he was fittest to provide it. On all\r\nthat relates to Essex, Foxe is an undoubted authority, and Foxe did not\r\nhesitate to attribute to Cromwell Henry’s policy at this crisis:--\r\n\r\n   “For so it pleased Almighty God, by means of the said Lord\r\n    Cromwell, to induce the king to suppress first the chantries,\r\n    then the friars’ houses and small monasteries, till, at length,\r\n    all the abbeys in England, both great and less, were utterly\r\n    overthrown and plucked up by the roots....\r\n\r\n   “Of how great laud and praise this man was worthy, and what\r\n    courage and stoutness was in him, it may hereby evidently\r\n    appear unto all men, that he alone, through the singular\r\n    dexterity of his wit and counsel, brought to pass that, which,\r\n    even unto this day no prince or king, throughout all Europe,\r\n    dare or can bring to pass. For whereas Brittania alone, of all\r\n    other nations, is and hath been, of her own proper nature,\r\n    most superstitious; this Cromwell, being born of a common\r\n    or base stock, through a divine method or policy of wit and\r\n    reason received, suffered, deluded, brake off, and repressed,\r\n    all the policies, trains, malice, and hatred of friars, monks,\r\n    religious men, and priests, of which sort there was a great\r\n    rabble in England.”[245]\r\n\r\nCromwell’s strength lay in his superiority to those scruples of\r\ntruth and honour which hamper feebler men. He did what circumstances\r\ndemanded. His object, like Philip’s, was to blacken his victims\r\nthat he might destroy them, and, to gather the evidence, he chose\r\ninstruments adapted to the work. To have used others would have\r\ndemonstrated himself unfit. Mr. Gairdner has remarked in his preface\r\nto the tenth volume of the _Calendar_: “We have no reason indeed to\r\nthink highly of the character of Cromwell’s visitors.”[246] This\r\nopinion of Mr. Gairdner is supported by all the evidence extant.\r\nThomas Legh, one of the commissioners, not only always took bribes,\r\nbut, having been appointed master of Sherburn Hospital, administered\r\nit “to the utter disinheritance, decay and destruction of the ancient\r\nand godly foundation of the same house.”[247] Henry probably thought\r\nhim dishonest, since he had his accounts investigated. Even Legh’s\r\ncolleague, Ap Rice, though venal himself, and in great fear of being\r\nmurdered for his treachery, denounced him in set terms to Cromwell:--\r\n\r\n   “And surely he asketh no less for every election than £20 as of\r\n    duty, which in my opinion is too much, and above any duty that\r\n    was ever taken heretofore. Also in his visitations he refuseth\r\n    many times his reward, though it be competent, for that they\r\n    offer him so little and maketh them to send after him such\r\n    rewards as may please him, for surely religious men were never\r\n    afraid so much of Dr. Allen as they be of him, he useth such\r\n    rough fashion with them.”[248]\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, Ap Rice, in alarm lest his frankness might lead\r\nto his assassination, wrote to beg his master to be cautious:--\r\n\r\n   “Forasmuch as the said Mr. Doctor is of such acquaintance and\r\n    familiarity with many rufflers and serving men, ... I having\r\n    commonly no great assistance with me when I go abroad, might\r\n    take perchance irrevocable harm of him or his ere I were aware.\r\n    Please keep secret what I have said.”[249]\r\n\r\nAp Rice himself had been in difficulty, and Legh had exposed him,\r\nfor he admitted being “so abashed” at the accusation he could make no\r\ndefence. He had, also, certainly done something which put him in the\r\npower of Cromwell, for he wrote: I know “from my own experience how\r\ndeadly it is for any man to incur your displeasure, which I would not\r\nwish for my greatest enemy.”[250]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testimony of such witnesses would be of doubtful value, even had\r\nthey expressed themselves freely; but the government only tolerated\r\none form of report. A good example of the discipline enforced is to be\r\nfound in Layton’s correspondence. He incautiously praised the Abbot of\r\nGlastonbury, and was reprimanded by Cromwell, for he wrote to excuse\r\nhimself:--\r\n\r\n   “Whereas I understand by Mr. Pollard you much marvel why I\r\n    would ... so greatly praise ... the abbot of Glaston.... So\r\n    that my excessive and indiscrete praise ... must needs now\r\n    redound to my great folly and untruth, and cannot ... but\r\n    much diminish my credit towards his majesty, and even so to\r\n    your lordship.... And although they be all false, feigned,\r\n    flattering hypocritical knaves, as undoubtedly there is none\r\n    other of that sort. I must therefore now at this my necessity,\r\n    most humbly beseech your lordship to pardon me for that my\r\n    folly then committed ... and of your goodness to mitigate the\r\n    king’s highness majesty in the premisses.”[251]\r\n\r\nThe charges made by the visitors are of a kind notoriously difficult to\r\nprove, even with ample time, and with trained investigators. Cromwell’s\r\nexamination was carried on by men of small worth, and in hot haste;\r\nno opportunity was given for more than a cursory inspection of the\r\npremises and the inmates:--\r\n\r\n   “This day we leave Bath for Kensam, where we shall make an end\r\n    by Tuesday, and then go on toward Maiden Bradley, within two\r\n    miles of which is a charterhouse called Wittame, and Bruton\r\n    Abbey seven miles, and Glastonbury seven miles.... If you tarry\r\n    with the king eight days we shall dispatch all the houses above\r\n    named.”[252]\r\n\r\nThe visitation began in August, 1535, and ended in February, 1536.\r\nDuring these six months, four or five men, often travelling together,\r\nundertook to examine one hundred and fifty-five houses scattered all\r\nover England. “To judge by the proportion in Yorkshire,” says Mr.\r\nGairdner, “the visitors examined only about four out of ten.”[253]\r\nSo far as can be ascertained, the evidence upon which the reports\r\nwere based was generally of the flimsiest kind; either the scandal of\r\nsome discontented monk or nun, or the tattle of servants. There was\r\na striking instance of this at a nunnery in Chicksand, where Layton\r\naccused two nuns of incontinence, although “the two prioresses would\r\nnot confess this, neither the parties, nor any of the nuns, but one old\r\nbeldame.”[254]\r\n\r\nWhen nothing could be elicited, the accused were deemed in a\r\nconspiracy. At Newark the house seemed well ordered, and nothing\r\nquestionable appeared on the surface, therefore Layton charged the\r\nmonks with being “confederyde,” but he added that he would object\r\nvarious horrible crimes against them, “which I have learnt from others.\r\nWhat I shall find I cannot tell.”[255]\r\n\r\nWhere silence was taken as confession, the nuns especially fared\r\nill. Very generally they were too frightened, or too disgusted, to\r\nanswer. Even if such evidence were uncontradicted, no great weight\r\ncould attach to it, but it happens that there is much on the other\r\nside. Not to speak of the episcopal visitations, which were carried\r\non as part of the discipline of the Church, Henry’s own government\r\nsubsequently appointed boards of commissioners composed of country\r\ngentlemen, and these boards, which made examinations at leisure\r\nin five counties, formed conclusions generally favourable to the\r\necclesiastics. Two examples will suffice to show the discrepancy\r\nbetween the views of the men whom Cromwell did, and did not control. At\r\nGeradon in Leicestershire, Cromwell’s board reported a convent of White\r\nCistercians, which contained five monks addicted to sodomy with ten\r\nboys.[256] The second board described the same corporation as “of good\r\nconversation, and God’s service well maintained.”[257]\r\n\r\nAt Grace Dieu two nuns were charged with incontinence.[258] The country\r\ngentlemen found there only fifteen White Nuns of Saint Austin, “of good\r\nand virtuous conversation and living.”[259]\r\n\r\nNo one familiar with the development of police during the later Middle\r\nAges, could have much doubt that, on the whole, the discipline of the\r\nconvents would correspond pretty accurately with the prevailing tone\r\nof society, and that, although asceticism and enthusiasm might have\r\ndeclined since the twelfth century, subordination to authority would\r\nhave increased with the advance of centralization. Rebellious monks,\r\nlike those who tried to murder Abélard, would certainly have been rarer\r\nat the time of the Reformation than at the opening of the crusades.\r\n\r\nThe crime of the English monks, like the crime of the Templars, was\r\ndefenceless wealth; and, like the Templars, they fared hardly in\r\nproportion to their devotion and their courage. The flexible and the\r\ncorrupt, who betrayed their trust, received pensions or promotion; the\r\nCarthusians, against whose stern enthusiasm torments were powerless,\r\nperished as their predecessors had perished in the field of Saint\r\nAntoine.\r\n\r\nThe attack of Cromwell’s hirelings resembled the onslaught of an\r\ninvading army. The convents fared like conquered towns; the shrines\r\nwere stripped and the booty heaped on carts, as at the sack of\r\nConstantinople. Churches were desecrated, windows broken, the roofs\r\nstripped of lead, the bells melted, the walls sold for quarries. Europe\r\noverflowed with vestments and altar ornaments, while the libraries\r\nwere destroyed. Toward the end of 1539 Legh reached Durham, and the\r\npurification of the sanctuary of Saint Cuthbert may be taken as an\r\nexample of the universal spoliation:--\r\n\r\n   “After the spoil of his ornaments and jewels, coming nearer\r\n    to his sacred body, thinking to have found nothing but dust\r\n    and bones, and finding the chest that he did lie in, very\r\n    strongly bound with iron, then the goldsmith did take a great\r\n    forge-hammer of a smith, and did break the said chest open.\r\n\r\n   “And when they had opened the chest, they found him lying\r\n    whole, uncorrupt, with his face bare, and his beard as it had\r\n    been a fortnight’s growth, and all his vestments upon him, as\r\n    he was accustomed to say mass withall, and his meet wand of\r\n    gold lying beside him.\r\n\r\n   “Then, when the goldsmith did perceive that he had broken one\r\n    of his legs, when he did break open the chest, he was very\r\n    sorry for it and did cry, ‘Alas, I have broken one of his\r\n    legs.’\r\n\r\n   “Then Dr. Henley [one of the commissioners] hearing him say so,\r\n    did call upon him, and did bid him cast down his bones.”[260]\r\n\r\nBy the statute of 1536, only those convents were suppressed which were\r\nworth less than £200 a year, or which, within twelve months after the\r\npassage of the act, should be granted to the king by the abbot. This\r\nlegislation spared the mitred abbeys, and as long as any conventual\r\nproperty remained undivided, the land-owners kept Cromwell in office,\r\nnot feeling, perhaps, quite sure of their capacity to succeed alone.\r\n\r\nIn 1539 it had proved impossible to force the three great abbots\r\nof Glastonbury, Reading, and Colchester into a surrender to the\r\nCrown, and accordingly Cromwell devised an act to vest in Henry such\r\nconventual lands as should be forfeited through attainder. Then he\r\nindicted the abbots for treason, and thus sought to bring the estates\r\nthey represented constructively within the statute. The fate of Abbot\r\nWhiting, whom Layton incautiously praised, will do for all. He was\r\neighty when he died, and his martyrdom is unusually interesting, as\r\nit laid the fortune of the great house of Bedford, one of the most\r\nsplendid of modern dukedoms.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners came unexpectedly, and found the old monk at a grange\r\nat Sharpham, about a mile from Glastonbury. On September 19 they\r\napprehended him, searched his apartment, and finding nothing likely\r\nto be of service, sent him up to London for Cromwell to deal with,\r\nthough he was “very weak and sickly.” Cromwell lodged him in the Tower,\r\nand examined him, apparently in a purely perfunctory fashion, for the\r\ngovernment had decided on its policy. The secretary of state simply\r\njotted down a memorandum to see “that the evidence be well sorted and\r\nthe indictments well drawn,” and left the details of the murder to John\r\nRussell, a man thoroughly to be trusted. Cromwell’s only anxiety was\r\nabout the indictments, and he had “the king’s learned counsel” with him\r\n“all day” discussing the matter. Finally they decided, between them,\r\nthat it would be better to proceed at Glaston, and Whiting was sent\r\nto Somersetshire to be dealt with by the progenitor of a long line of\r\nopulent Whig landlords.\r\n\r\nIn superintending the trial, Russell showed an energy and judgment\r\nwhich won its reward. On the 14th of November, when the invalid reached\r\nWells, he wrote that he had provided for him “as worshipful a jury as\r\nwas ever charged here these many years. And there was never seen in\r\nthese parts so great appearance as were here at this present time,\r\nand never better willing to serve the king.”[261] Russell wasted no\r\ntime. He arranged for the trial one day and the execution the next.\r\n“The Abbot of Glastonbury was arraigned, and the next day put to\r\nexecution with two other of his monks, for the robbing of Glastonbury\r\nchurch.”[262]\r\n\r\nHe had the old man bound on a hurdle and dragged to the top of Tor\r\nHill, “but ... he would confess no more gold nor silver, nor any\r\nother thing more than he did before your Lordship in the Tower....\r\nAnd thereupon took his death very patiently, and his head and body\r\nbestowed in like manner as I certified your lordship in my last\r\nletter.”[263] “One quarter standeth at Wells, another at Bath, and at\r\nIlchester and Bridgewater the rest. And his head upon the abbey gate at\r\nGlaston.”[264]\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of the following April, Henry created Cromwell Earl of\r\nEssex, preparatory to slaughtering him. Within two months the new earl\r\nwas arrested by his bitterest enemy, the Duke of Norfolk, the chief\r\nof the landed interest; on the 28th of July he lost his head on Tower\r\nHill, and his colossal fortune fed the men who had divided the body of\r\nWhiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE EVICTION OF THE YEOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nLike primitive Rome, England, during the Middle Ages, had an unusually\r\nhomogeneous population of farmers, who made a remarkable infantry. Not\r\nthat the cavalry was defective; on the contrary, from top to bottom\r\nof society, every man was a soldier, and the aristocracy had excellent\r\nfighting qualities. Many of the kings, like Cœur-de-Lion, Edward III.,\r\nand Henry V., ranked among the ablest commanders of their day; the\r\nBlack Prince has always been a hero of chivalry; and earls and barons\r\ncould be named by the score who were famous in the Hundred Years’ War.\r\n\r\nYet, although the English knights were a martial body, there is nothing\r\nto show that, on the whole, they surpassed the French. The English\r\ninfantry won Crécy and Poitiers, and this infantry, which was long\r\nthe terror of Europe, was recruited from among the small farmers who\r\nflourished in Great Britain until they were exterminated by the advance\r\nof civilization.\r\n\r\nAs long as the individual could at all withstand the attack of the\r\ncentralized mass of society, England remained a hot-bed for breeding\r\nthis species of man. A mediæval king had no means of collecting a\r\nregular revenue by taxation; he was only the chief of the free-men, and\r\nhis estates were supposed to suffice for his expenditure. The revenue\r\nthe land yielded consisted of men, not money, and to obtain men, the\r\nsovereign granted his domains to his nearest friends, who, in their\r\nturn, cut their manors into as many farms as possible, and each farmer\r\npaid his rent with his body.\r\n\r\nA baron’s strength lay in the band of spears which followed his banner,\r\nand therefore he subdivided his acres as much as possible, having no\r\ngreat need of money. Himself a farmer, he cultivated enough of his fief\r\nto supply his wants, to provide his table, and to furnish his castle,\r\nbut, beyond this, all he kept to himself was loss. Under such a system\r\nmoney contracts played a small part, and economic competition was\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe tenants were free-men, whose estates passed from father to son by\r\na fixed tenure; no one could underbid them with their landlord, and no\r\ncapitalist could ruin them by depressing wages, for the serfs formed\r\nthe basis of society, and these serfs were likewise land-owners. In\r\ntheory, the villains may have held at will; but in fact they were\r\nprobably the descendants, or at least the representatives, of the\r\n_coloni_ of the Empire, and a base tenure could be proved by the roll\r\nof the manorial court. Thus even the weakest were protected by custom,\r\nand there was no competition in the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe manor was the social unit, and, as the country was sparsely\r\nsettled, waste spaces divided the manors from each other, and these\r\nwastes came to be considered as commons appurtenant to the domain in\r\nwhich the tenants of the manor had vested rights. The extent of these\r\nrights varied from generation to generation, but substantially they\r\namounted to a privilege of pasture, fuel, or the like; aids which,\r\nthough unimportant to large property owners, were vital when the margin\r\nof income was narrow.\r\n\r\nDuring the old imaginative age, before centralization gathered headway,\r\nlittle inducement existed to pilfer these domains, since there was\r\nroom in plenty, and the population increased slowly, if at all. The\r\nmoment the form of competition changed, these conditions were reversed.\r\nPrecisely when a money rent became a more potent force than armed\r\nmen, may be hard to determine, but certainly that time had come when\r\nHenry VIII. mounted the throne, for then capitalistic farming was\r\non the increase, and speculation in real estate already caused sharp\r\ndistress. At that time the establishment of a police had destroyed the\r\nvalue of the retainer, and competitive rents had generally supplanted\r\nmilitary tenures. Instead of tending to subdivide, as in an age of\r\ndecentralization, land consolidated in the hands of the economically\r\nstrong, and capitalists systematically enlarged their estates by\r\nenclosing the commons, and depriving the yeomen of their immemorial\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth-century landlords were a type quite distinct from the\r\nancient feudal gentry. As a class they were gifted with the economic,\r\nand not with the martial instinct, and they throve on competition.\r\nTheir strength lay in their power of absorbing the property of their\r\nweaker neighbours under the protection of an overpowering police.\r\n\r\nEverything tended to accelerate consolidation, especially the rise\r\nin the value of money. While, even with the debasement of the coin,\r\nthe price of cereals did not advance, the growth of manufactures had\r\ncaused wool to double in value. “We need not therefore be surprised at\r\nfinding that the temptation to sheep-farming was almost irresistible,\r\nand that statute after statute failed to arrest the tendency.”[265] The\r\nconversion of arable land into pasture led, of course, to wholesale\r\neviction, and by 1515 the suffering had become so acute that details\r\nwere given in acts of Parliament. Places where two hundred persons\r\nhad lived, by growing corn and grain, were left desolate, the houses\r\nhad decayed, and the churches fallen into ruin.[266] The language of\r\nthese statutes proves that the descriptions of contemporaries were not\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\n   “For I myselfe know many townes and villages sore decayed, for\r\n    yt where as in times past there wer in some town an hundred\r\n    householdes there remain not now thirty; in some fifty, ther\r\n    are not now ten; yea (which is more to be lamented) I knowe\r\n    townes so wholly decayed, that there is neyther sticke nor\r\n    stone standyng as they use to say.\r\n\r\n   “Where many men had good lyuinges, and maynteined hospitality,\r\n    able at times to helpe the kyng in his warres, and to susteyne\r\n    other charges, able also to helpe their pore neighboures, and\r\n    vertuously to bring up theyr children in Godly letters and\r\n    good scyences, nowe sheepe and conies deuoure altogether, no\r\n    man inhabiting the aforesayed places. Those beastes which\r\n    were created of God for the nouryshment of man doe nowe\r\n    deuoure man.... And the cause of all thys wretchednesse and\r\n    beggery in the common weale are the gredy Gentylmen, whyche\r\n    are shepemongers and grasyars. Whyle they study for their\r\n    owne priuate commoditie, the common weale is lyke to decay.\r\n    Since they began to be shepe maysters and feders of cattell,\r\n    we neyther had vyttayle nor cloth of any reasonable pryce. No\r\n    meruayle, for these forstallars of the market, as they use to\r\n    saye, haue gotten all thynges so into theyr handes, that the\r\n    poore man muste eyther bye it at their pryce, or else miserably\r\n    starue for hongar, and wretchedly dye for colde.”[267]\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the acreage in tillage must have lessened the crop of\r\nthe cereals, and accounts for their slight rise in value during the\r\nsecond quarter of the sixteenth century. Nevertheless this rise gave\r\nthe farmer no relief, as, under competition, rents advanced faster than\r\nprices, and in the generation which reformed the Church, the misery\r\nof yeomen had become extreme. In 1549 Latimer preached a sermon, which\r\ncontains a passage often quoted, but always interesting:--\r\n\r\n   “Furthermore, if the king’s honour, as some men say, standeth\r\n    in the great multitude of people; then these graziers,\r\n    inclosers, and rent-rearers, are hinderers of the king’s\r\n    honour. For where as have been a great many householders and\r\n    inhabitants, there is now but a shepherd and his dog....\r\n\r\n   “My father was yeoman, and had no lands of his own, only he\r\n    had a farm of three or four pound by year at the uttermost,\r\n    and hereupon he tilled so much as kept half a dozen men. He had\r\n    walk for a hundred sheep; and my mother milked thirty kine. He\r\n    was able, and did find the king a harness, with himself and his\r\n    horse, while he came to the place that he should receive the\r\n    king’s wages. I can remember that I buckled his harness when he\r\n    went unto Blackheath field. He kept me to school, or else I had\r\n    not been able to have preached before the king’s majesty now.\r\n\r\n   “He married my sisters with five pound, or twenty nobles\r\n    apiece; so that he brought them up in godliness and fear of\r\n    God. He kept hospitality for his poor neighbours, and some\r\n    alms he gave to the poor. And all this he did of the said\r\n    farm, where he that now hath it payeth sixteen pound by year,\r\n    or more, and is not able to do anything for his prince, for\r\n    himself, nor for his children, or give a cup of drink to the\r\n    poor.”[268]\r\n\r\nThe small proprietor suffered doubly: he had to meet the competition of\r\nlarge estates, and to endure the curtailment of his resources through\r\nthe enclosure of the commons. The effect was to pauperize the yeomanry\r\nand lesser gentry, and before the Reformation the homeless poor had so\r\nmultiplied that, in 1530, Parliament passed the first of a series of\r\nvagrant acts.[269] At the outset the remedy applied was comparatively\r\nmild, for able-bodied mendicants were only to be whipped until they\r\nwere bloody, returned to their domicile, and there whipped until they\r\nput themselves to labour. As no labour was supplied, the legislation\r\nfailed, and in 1537 the emptying of the convents brought matters to a\r\nclimax. Meanwhile Parliament tried the experiment of killing off the\r\nunemployed; by the second act vagrants were first mutilated and then\r\nhanged as felons.[270]\r\n\r\nIn 1547, when Edward VI. was crowned, the great crisis had reached\r\nits height. The silver of Potosi had not yet brought relief, the\r\ncurrency was in chaos, labour was disorganized, and the nation seethed\r\nwith the discontent which broke out two years later in rebellion. The\r\nland-owners held absolute power, and before they yielded to the burden\r\nof feeding the starving, they seriously addressed themselves to the\r\ntask of extermination. The preamble of the third act stated that,\r\nin spite of the “great travel” and “godly statutes” of Parliament,\r\npauperism had not diminished, therefore any vagrant brought before two\r\njustices was to be adjudged the slave of his captor for two years. He\r\nmight be compelled to work by beating, chaining, or otherwise, be fed\r\non bread and water, or refuse meat, and confined by a ring of iron\r\nabout his neck, arms or legs. For his first attempt at escape, his\r\nslavery became perpetual, for his second, he was hanged.[271]\r\n\r\nEven as late as 1591, in the midst of the great expansion which brought\r\nprosperity to all Europe, and when the monks and nuns, cast adrift\r\nby the suppression of the convents, must have mostly died, beggars so\r\nswarmed that at the funeral of the Earl of Shrewsbury “there were by\r\nthe report of such as served the dole unto them, the number of 8000.\r\nAnd they thought that there were almost as many more that could not\r\nbe served, through their unruliness. Yea, the press was so great that\r\ndivers were slain and many hurt. And further it is reported of credible\r\npersons, that well estimated the number of all the said beggars, that\r\nthey thought there were about 20,000.” It was conjectured “that all the\r\nsaid poor people were abiding and dwelling within thirty miles’ compass\r\nof Sheffield.”[272]\r\n\r\nIn 1549, just as the tide turned, insurrection blazed out all\r\nover England. In the west a pitched battle was fought between the\r\npeasantry and foreign mercenaries, and Exeter was relieved only after\r\na long siege. In Norfolk the yeomen, led by one Kett, controlled a\r\nlarge district for a considerable time. They arrested the unpopular\r\nlandlords, threw open the commons they had appropriated, and ransacked\r\nthe manor houses to pay indemnities to evicted farmers. When attacked,\r\nthey fought stubbornly, and stormed Norwich twice.\r\n\r\nStrype described “these mutineers” as “certain poor men that sought\r\nto have their commons again, by force and power taken from them; and\r\nthat a regulation be made according to law of arable lands turned into\r\npasture.”[273]\r\n\r\nCranmer understood the situation perfectly, and though a consummate\r\ncourtier, and himself a creation of the capitalistic revolution, spoke\r\nin this way of his patrons:--\r\n\r\n   “And they complain much of rich men and gentlemen, saying,\r\n    that they take the commons from the poor, that they raise the\r\n    prices of all manner of things, that they rule the poverty, and\r\n    oppress them at their pleasure....\r\n\r\n   “And although here I seem only to speak against these unlawful\r\n    assemblers, yet I cannot allow those, but I must needs threaten\r\n    everlasting damnation unto them, whether they be gentlemen\r\n    or whatsoever they be, which never cease to purchase and join\r\n    house to house, and land to land, as though they alone ought to\r\n    possess and inhabit the earth.”[274]\r\n\r\nRevolt against the pressure of this unrestricted economic competition\r\ntook the form of Puritanism, of resistance to the religious\r\norganization controlled by capital, and even in Cranmer’s time, the\r\nattitude of the descendants of the men who formed the line at Poitiers\r\nand Crécy was so ominous that Anglican bishops took alarm.\r\n\r\n   “It is reported that there be many among these unlawful\r\n    assemblies that pretend knowledge of the gospel, and will needs\r\n    be called gospellers.... But now I will go further to speak\r\n    somewhat of the great hatred which divers of these seditious\r\n    persons do bear against the gentlemen; which hatred in many is\r\n    so outrageous, that they desire nothing more than the spoil,\r\n    ruin, and destruction of them that be rich and wealthy.”[275]\r\n\r\nSomerset, who owed his elevation to the accident of being the\r\nbrother of Jane Seymour, proved unequal to the crisis of 1449, and\r\nwas supplanted by John Dudley, now better remembered as Duke of\r\nNorthumberland. Dudley was the strongest member of the new aristocracy.\r\nHis father, Edmund Dudley, had been the celebrated lawyer who rose\r\nto eminence as the extortioner of Henry VII., and whom Henry VIII.\r\nexecuted, as an act of popularity, on his accession. John, beside\r\ninheriting his father’s financial ability, had a certain aptitude\r\nfor war, and undoubted courage; accordingly he rose rapidly. He and\r\nCromwell understood each other; he flattered Cromwell, and Cromwell\r\nlent him money.[276] Strype has intimated that Dudley had strong\r\nmotives for resisting the restoration of the commons.[277]\r\n\r\nIn 1547 he was created Earl of Warwick, and in 1549 suppressed Kett’s\r\nrebellion. This military success brought him to the head of the State;\r\nhe thrust Somerset aside, and took the title of Duke of Northumberland.\r\nHis son was equally distinguished. He became the favourite of Queen\r\nElizabeth, who created him Earl of Leicester; but, though an expert\r\ncourtier, he was one of the most incompetent generals whom even the\r\nTudor landed aristocracy ever put in the field.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances of the reign of Edward VI. did not ripen into\r\nrevolution, probably because of the relief given by rising prices\r\nafter 1550; but, though they fell short of actual civil war, they were\r\nsufficiently formidable to terrify the aristocracy into abandoning\r\ntheir policy of killing off the surplus population. In 1552 the\r\nfirst statute was passed[278] looking toward the systematic relief of\r\npaupers. Small farmers prospered greatly after 1660, for prices rose\r\nstrongly, very much more strongly than rents; nor was it until after\r\nthe beginning of the seventeenth century, when rents again began to\r\nadvance, that the yeomanry once more grew restive. Cromwell raised his\r\nIronsides from among the great-grandchildren of the men who stormed\r\nNorwich with Kett.\r\n\r\n   “I had a very worthy friend then; and he was a very noble\r\n    person, and I know his memory is very grateful to all,--Mr. John\r\n    Hampden. At my first going out into this engagement, I saw\r\n    our men were beaten at every hand. I did indeed; and desired\r\n    him that he would make some additions to my Lord Essex’s army,\r\n    of some new regiments; and I told him I would be serviceable\r\n    to him in bringing such men in as I thought had a spirit\r\n    that would do something in the work. This is very true that\r\n    I tell you; God knows I lie not. ‘Your troops,’ said I, ‘are\r\n    most of them old decayed serving-men, and tapsters, and such\r\n    kind of fellows; and,’ said I, ‘their troops are gentlemen’s\r\n    sons, younger sons and persons of quality: do you think that\r\n    the spirits of such base and mean fellows will ever be able\r\n    to encounter gentlemen, that have honour and courage and\r\n    resolution in them?’... Truly I did tell him; ‘You must get\r\n    men of a spirit: ... a spirit that is likely to go on as far as\r\n    gentlemen will go;--or else you will be beaten still....’\r\n\r\n   “He was a wise and worthy person; and he did think that I\r\n    talked a good notion, but an impracticable one. Truly I told\r\n    him I could do somewhat in it, ... and truly I must needs\r\n    say this to you, ... I raised such men as had the fear of God\r\n    before them, as made some conscience of what they did; and from\r\n    that day forward, I must say to you, they were never beaten,\r\n    and wherever they were engaged against the enemy, they beat\r\n    continually.”[279]\r\n\r\nThus, by degrees, the pressure of intensifying centralization split the\r\nold homogeneous population of England into classes, graduated according\r\nto their economic capacity. Those without the necessary instinct sank\r\ninto agricultural day labourers, whose lot, on the whole, has probably\r\nbeen somewhat worse than that of ordinary slaves. The gifted, like the\r\nHowards, the Dudleys, the Cecils, and the Boleyns, rose to be rich\r\nnobles and masters of the State. Between the two accumulated a mass\r\nof bold and needy adventurers, who were destined finally not only to\r\ndominate England, but to shape the destinies of the world.\r\n\r\nOne section of these, the shrewder and less venturesome, gravitated to\r\nthe towns, and grew rich as merchants, like the founder of the Osborn\r\nfamily, whose descendant became Duke of Leeds; or like the celebrated\r\nJosiah Child, who, in the reign of William III., controlled the whole\r\neastern trade of the kingdom. The less astute and the more martial took\r\nto the sea, and as slavers, pirates, and conquerors, built up England’s\r\ncolonial empire, and established her maritime supremacy. Of this class\r\nwere Drake and Blake, Hawkins, Raleigh, and Clive.\r\n\r\nFor several hundred years after the Norman conquest, Englishmen showed\r\nlittle taste for the ocean, probably because sufficient outlet for\r\ntheir energies existed on land. In the Middle Ages the commerce of\r\nthe island was mostly engrossed by the Merchants of the Steelyard,\r\nan offshoot of the Hanseatic league; while the great explorers of\r\nthe fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries were usually Italians or\r\nPortuguese; men like Columbus, Vespucius, Vasco-da-Gama, or Magellan.\r\nThis state of things lasted, however, only until economic competition\r\nbegan to ruin the small farmers, and then the hardiest and boldest\r\nrace of Europe were cast adrift, and forced to seek their fortunes in\r\nstrange lands.\r\n\r\nFor the soldier or the adventurer, there was no opening in England\r\nafter the battle of Flodden. A peaceful and inert bourgeoisie more and\r\nmore supplanted the ancient martial baronage; their representatives\r\nshrank from campaigns like those of Richard I., the Edwards, and Henry\r\nV., and therefore, for the evicted farmer, there was nothing but the\r\nfar-off continents of America and Asia, and to these he directed his\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nThe lives of the admirals tell the tale on every page. Drake’s history\r\nis now known. His family belonged to the lesser Devon gentry, but\r\nfallen so low that his father gladly apprenticed him as ship’s boy on\r\na channel coaster, a life of almost intolerable hardship. From this\r\nhumble beginning he fought his way, by dint of courage and genius, to\r\nbe one of England’s three greatest seamen; and Blake and Nelson, the\r\nother two, were of the same blood.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert was of the same west country stock as Drake;\r\nFrobisher was a poor Yorkshire man, and Sir Walter Raleigh came from\r\na ruined house. No less than five knightly branches of Raleigh’s\r\nfamily once throve together in the western counties; but disaster came\r\nwith the Tudors, and Walter’s father fell into trouble through his\r\nPuritanism. Walter himself early had to face the world, and carved out\r\nhis fortune with his sword. He served in France in the religious wars;\r\nafterward, perhaps, in Flanders; then, through Gilbert, he obtained a\r\ncommission in Ireland, but finally drifted to Elizabeth’s court, where\r\nhe took to buccaneering, and conceived the idea of colonizing America.\r\n\r\nA profound gulf separated these adventurers from the landed\r\ncapitalists, for they were of an extreme martial type; a type hated\r\nand feared by the nobility. With the exception of the years of the\r\nCommonwealth, the landlords controlled England from the Reformation\r\nto the revolution of 1688, a period of one hundred and fifty years,\r\nand, during that long interval, there is little risk in asserting\r\nthat the aristocracy did not produce a single soldier or sailor of\r\nmore than average capacity. The difference between the royal and the\r\nparliamentary armies was as great as though they had been recruited\r\nfrom different races. Charles had not a single officer of merit, while\r\nit is doubtful if any force has ever been better led than the troops\r\norganized by Cromwell.\r\n\r\nMen like Drake, Blake, and Cromwell were among the most terrible\r\nwarriors of the world, and they were distrusted and feared by an\r\noligarchy which felt instinctively its inferiority in arms. Therefore,\r\nin Elizabeth’s reign, politicians like the Cecils took care that the\r\ngreat seamen should have no voice in public affairs. And though these\r\nmen defeated the Armada, and though England owed more to them than\r\nto all the rest of her population put together, not one reached the\r\npeerage, or was treated with confidence and esteem. Drake’s fate shows\r\nwhat awaited them. Like all his class, Drake was hot for war with\r\nSpain, and from time to time he was unchained, when fighting could not\r\nbe averted; but his policy was rejected, his operations more nearly\r\nresembled those of a pirate than of an admiral, and when he died, he\r\ndied in something like disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy even made the false position in which they placed\r\ntheir sailors a source of profit, for they forced them to buy pardon\r\nfor their victories by surrendering the treasure they had won with\r\ntheir blood. Fortescue actually had to interfere to defend Raleigh and\r\nHawkins from Elizabeth’s rapacity. In 1592 Borough sailed in command of\r\na squadron fitted out by the two latter, with some contribution from\r\nthe queen and the city of London. Borough captured the carack, the\r\nMadre-de-Dios, whose pepper alone Burleigh estimated at £102,000. The\r\ncargo proved worth £141,000, and of this Elizabeth’s share, according\r\nto the rule of distribution in use, amounted to one-tenth, or £14,000.\r\nShe demanded £80,000, and allowed Raleigh and Hawkins, who had spent\r\n£34,000, only £36,000. Raleigh bitterly contrasted the difference made\r\nbetween himself a soldier, and a peer, or a London speculator. “I was\r\nthe cause that all this came to the Queen, and that the King of Spaine\r\nspent 300,000^{li} the last yere.... I that adventured all my estate,\r\nlose of my principall.... I tooke all the care and paines; ... they\r\nonly sate still ... for which double is given to them, and less then\r\nmine own to me.”[280]\r\n\r\nRaleigh was so brave he could not comprehend that his talent was\r\nhis peril. He fancied his capacity for war would bring him fame and\r\nfortune, and it led him to the block. While Elizabeth lived, the\r\nadmiration of the woman for the hero probably saved him, but he never\r\neven entered the Privy Council, and of real power he had none. The\r\nsovereign the oligarchy chose was James, and James imprisoned and then\r\nslew him. Nor was Raleigh’s fate peculiar, for, through timidity, the\r\nCavaliers conceived an almost equal hate of many soldiers. They dug\r\nup the bones of Cromwell, they tried to murder William III., and they\r\ndragged down Marlborough in the midst of victory. Such were the new\r\nclasses into which economic competition divided the people of England\r\nduring the sixteenth century, and the Reformation was only one among\r\nmany of the effects of this profound social revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the first fifty-three years of the sixteenth century, England passed\r\nthrough two distinct phases of ecclesiastical reform; the earlier,\r\nunder Henry, when the conventual property was appropriated by the\r\nrising aristocracy; the later, under Edward, when portions of the\r\nsecular endowments were also seized. Each period of spoliation was\r\naccompanied by innovations in doctrine, and each was followed by a\r\nreaction, the final one, under Mary, taking the form of reconciliation\r\nwith Rome. Viewed in connection with the insurrections, the whole\r\nmovement can hardly be distinguished from an armed conquest of the\r\nimaginative by the economic section of society; a conquest which\r\nproduced a most curious and interesting development of a new clerical\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages, the hierarchy had been a body of\r\nmiracle-workers, independent of, and at first superior to, the State.\r\nThis great corporation had subsisted upon its own resources, and\r\nhad generally been controlled by men of the ecstatic temperament, of\r\nwhom Saint Anselm is, perhaps, the most perfect example. After the\r\nconquest at the Reformation, these conditions changed. Having lost\r\nits independence, the priesthood lapsed into an adjunct of the civil\r\npower; it then became reorganized upon an economic basis, and gradually\r\nturned into a salaried class, paid to inculcate obedience to the\r\nrepresentative of an oligarchy which controlled the national revenue.\r\nPerhaps, in all modern history, there is no more striking example of\r\nthe rapid and complete manner in which, under favourable circumstances,\r\none type can supersede another, than the thoroughness with which the\r\neconomic displaced the emotional temperament, in the Anglican Church,\r\nduring the Tudor dynasty. The mental processes of the new pastors did\r\nnot differ so much in degree as in kind from those of the old.\r\n\r\nAlthough the spoliations of Edward are less well remembered than those\r\nof his father, they were hardly less drastic. They began with the\r\nestates of the chantries and guilds, and rapidly extended to all sorts\r\nof property. In the Middle Ages, one of the chief sources of revenue of\r\nthe sacred class had been their prayers for souls in purgatory, and all\r\nlarge churches contained chapels, many of them richly endowed, for the\r\nperpetual celebration of masses for the dead; in England and Wales more\r\nthan a thousand such chapels existed, whose revenues were often very\r\nvaluable. These were the chantries, which vanished with the imaginative\r\nage which created them, and the guilds shared the same fate.\r\n\r\nBefore economic competition had divided men into classes according\r\nto their financial capacity, all craftsmen possessed capital, as\r\nall agriculturists held land. The guild established the craftsman’s\r\nsocial status; as a member of a trade corporation he was governed by\r\nregulations fixing the number of hands he might employ, the amount\r\nof goods he might produce, and the quality of his workmanship; on\r\nthe other hand, the guild regulated the market, and ensured a demand.\r\nTradesmen, perhaps, did not easily grow rich, but they as seldom became\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nWith centralization life changed. Competition sifted the strong from\r\nthe weak; the former waxed wealthy, and hired hands at wages, the\r\nlatter lost all but the ability to labour; and, when the corporate body\r\nof producers had thus disintegrated, nothing stood between the common\r\nproperty and the men who controlled the engine of the law. By the 1\r\nEdward VI., c. 14, all the possessions of the schools, colleges, and\r\nguilds of England, except the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge and the\r\nguilds of London, were conveyed to the king, and the distribution thus\r\nbegun extended far and wide, and has been forcibly described by Mr.\r\nBlunt:--\r\n\r\n   “They tore off the lead from the roofs, and wrenched out the\r\n    brasses from the floors. The books they despoiled of their\r\n    costly covers, and then sold them for waste paper. The gold\r\n    and silver plate they melted down with copper and lead, to\r\n    make a coinage so shamefully debased as was never known before\r\n    or since in England. The vestments of altars and priests they\r\n    turned into table-covers, carpets, and hangings, when not very\r\n    costly; and when worth more money than usual, they sold them\r\n    to foreigners, not caring who used them for ‘superstitious’\r\n    purposes, but caring to make the best ‘bargains’ they could\r\n    of their spoil. Even the very surplices and altar linen would\r\n    fetch something, and that too was seized by their covetous\r\n    hands.”[281]\r\n\r\nThese “covetous hands” were the privy councillors. Henry had not\r\nintended that any member of the board should have precedence, but the\r\nking’s body was not cold before Edward Seymour began an intrigue to\r\nmake himself protector. To consolidate a party behind him, he opened\r\nhis administration by distributing all the spoil he could lay hands\r\non; and Mr. Froude estimated that “on a computation most favourable to\r\nthe council, estates worth ... in modern currency about five millions”\r\nof pounds, were “appropriated--I suppose I must not say stolen--and\r\ndivided among themselves.”[282] At the head of this council stood\r\nCranmer, who took his share without scruple. Probably Froude’s estimate\r\nis far too low; for though Seymour, as Duke of Somerset, had, like\r\nHenry, to meet imperative claims which drained his purse, he yet built\r\nSomerset House, the most sumptuous palace of London.\r\n\r\nSeymour was put to death by Dudley when he rose to power by his\r\nmilitary success in Norfolk. Dudley as well as Cromwell was fitted\r\nfor the emergency in which he lived; bold, able, unscrupulous and\r\nenergetic, his party hated but followed him, because without him they\r\nsaw no way to seize the property they coveted. He too, like Cromwell,\r\nallied himself with the evangelical clergy, and under Edward the\r\northodoxy of the “Six Articles” gave way to the doctrine of Geneva.\r\nEven in 1548 Calvin had been able to write to Somerset, thanking God\r\nthat, through his wisdom, the “pure truth” was preached;[283] but when\r\nDudley administered the government as Duke of Northumberland, bishops\r\ndid not hesitate to teach that the dogma of the “carnal presence”\r\nin the sacrament “maintaineth that beastly kind of cruelty of the\r\n‘Anthropophagi,’ that is, the devourers of man’s flesh: for it is a\r\nmore cruel thing to devour a quick man, than to slay him.”[284]\r\n\r\nDudley resembled Henry and Norfolk in being naturally conservative,\r\nfor he died a Catholic; but with them all, money was the supreme\r\nobject, and as they lacked the physical force to plunder alone, they\r\nwere obliged to conciliate the Radicals. These were represented by\r\nKnox, and to Knox the duke paid assiduous court. The Scotchman began\r\npreaching in Berwick in 1549, but the government soon brought him to\r\nLondon, and in 1551 made him a royal chaplain, and, as chaplain, he\r\nwas called upon to approve the Forty-two Articles of 1552. This he\r\ncould do conscientiously, as they contained the dogmas of election\r\nand predestination, original sin, and justification by faith, beside a\r\ndenial of “the reall and bodilie presence ... of Christes fleshe, and\r\nbloude, in the Sacramente of the Lordes Supper.”\r\n\r\nDudley tried hard to buy Knox, and offered him the See of Rochester;\r\nbut the duke excited the deepest distrust and dislike in the preacher,\r\nwho called him “that wretched and miserable Northumberland.” He\r\nrejected the preferment, and indeed, from the beginning, bad blood\r\nseems to have lain between the Calvinists and the court. Writing at\r\nthe beginning of 1554, Knox expressed his opinion of the reforming\r\naristocracy in emphatic language, beginning with Somerset, “who\r\nbecame so cold in hearing Godis Word, that the year befoir his last\r\napprehensioun, he wald ga visit his masonis, and wald not dainyie\r\nhimself to ga frome his gallerie to his hall for heiring of a\r\nsermone.”[285] Afterward matters grew worse, for “the haill Counsaile\r\nhad said, Thay wald heir no mo of thair sermonis: thay wer but\r\nindifferent fellowis; (yea, and sum of thame eschameit not to call\r\nthame pratting knaves.)”[286]\r\n\r\nFinally, just before Edward’s death the open rupture came. Knox had\r\na supreme contempt and antipathy for the Lord Treasurer, Paulet,\r\nMarquis of Winchester, whom he called a “crafty fox.” During Edward’s\r\nlife, jeered Knox, “who was moste bolde to crye, Bastarde, bastarde,\r\nincestuous bastarde, Mary shall never rule over us,” and now that Mary\r\nis on the throne it is to her Paulet “crouches and kneeleth.”[287] In\r\nthe last sermon he preached before the king he let loose his tongue,\r\nand probably he would have quitted the court, even had the reign\r\ncontinued. In this sermon Dudley was Ahithophel, Paulet, Shebna:--\r\n\r\n   “I made this affirmacion, That commonlye it was sene, that\r\n    the most godly princes hadde officers and chief counseilours\r\n    moste ungodlye, conjured enemies to Goddes true religion,\r\n    and traitours to their princes.... Was David, sayd I, and\r\n    Ezechias, princes of great and godly giftes and experience,\r\n    abused by crafty counsailers and dissemblyng hypocrites? What\r\n    wonder is it then, that a yonge and innocent Kinge be deceived\r\n    by craftye, covetouse, wycked, and ungodly counselours? I\r\n    am greatly afrayd, that Achitophel be counsailer, that Judas\r\n    beare the purse, and that Sobna be scribe, comptroller, and\r\n    treasurer. This, and somwhat more I spake that daye, not in a\r\n    corner (as many yet can wytnesse) but even before those whome\r\n    my conscience judged worthy of accusation.”[288]\r\n\r\nKnox understood the relation which men of his stamp bore to\r\nAnglicanism. In 1549 much land yet remained to be divided, therefore\r\nhe and his like were flattered and cajoled until Paulet and his\r\nfriends should be strong enough to discard them. Faith, in the\r\nhands of the monied oligarchy, became an instrument of police, and,\r\nfrom the Reformation downward, revelation has been expounded in\r\nEngland by statute. Hence men of the imaginative type, who could not\r\naccept their creed with their stipend, were at any moment in danger\r\nof being adjudged heretics, and suffering the extreme penalty of\r\ninsubordination.\r\n\r\nDocility to lay dictation has always been the test by which the\r\nAnglican clergy have been sifted from Catholics and Puritans. To\r\nthe imaginative mind a faith must spring from a revelation, and a\r\nrevelation must be infallible and unchangeable. Truth must be single.\r\nCatholics believed their revelation to be continuous, delivered through\r\nthe mouth of an illuminated priesthood, speaking in its corporate\r\ncapacity. Puritans held that theirs had been made once for all, and was\r\ncontained in a book. But both Catholics and Puritans were clear that\r\ndivine truth was immutable, and that the universal Church could not\r\nerr. To minds of this type, statutes regulating the appearance of God’s\r\nbody in the elements were not only impious but absurd, and men of the\r\npriestly temperament, whether Catholic or Puritan, have faced death in\r\nits most appalling forms, rather than bow down before them.\r\n\r\nHere Fisher and Knox, Bellarmine and Calvin, agreed. Rather than accept\r\nthe royal supremacy, the flower of the English priesthood sought\r\npoverty and exile, the scaffold and the stake. For this, the aged\r\nFisher hastened to the block on Tower Hill; for this, Forest dangled\r\nover the embers of the smouldering rood; for this, the Carthusians\r\nrotted in their noisome dens. Nor were Puritans a whit behind Catholics\r\nin asserting the sacerdotal dignity; “Erant enim blasphemi qui vocarent\r\neum [Henricum VIII.] summum caput ecclesiæ sub Christo,” wrote Calvin,\r\nand on this ground the Nonconformists fought the established Church,\r\nfrom Elizabeth’s accession downward.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Martin Marprelate only restated an issue which had\r\nbeen raised by Hildebrand five hundred years before; for the advance\r\nof centralization had reproduced in England something of the same\r\nconditions which prevailed at Constantinople when it became a centre\r\nof exchanges. Wherever civilization has reached the point at which\r\nenergy expresses itself through money, faith must be subordinate to the\r\nrepresentative of wealth. Stephen Gardiner understood the conditions\r\nunder which he lived, and accepted his servitude in consideration of\r\nthe great See of Winchester. With striking acuteness he cited Justinian\r\nas a precedent for Henry:--\r\n\r\n   “Then, Sir, who did ever disallow Justinian’s fact, that made\r\n    laws concerning the glorious Trinity, and the Catholic faith,\r\n    of bishops, of men, of the clergy, of heretics, and others,\r\n    such like?”[289]\r\n\r\nFrom the day of the breach with Rome, the British priesthood sank\r\ninto wage-earners, and those of the ancient clergy who remained in\r\nthe Anglican hierarchy after the Reformation, acquiesced in their\r\nposition, as appeared in all their writings, but in none, perhaps, more\r\nstrikingly than in the Formularies of Faith of Henry VIII., where the\r\nepiscopal bench submitted their views of orthodoxy to the revision of\r\nthe secular power:--\r\n\r\n   “And albeit, most dread and benign sovereign lord, we do affirm\r\n    by our learnings with one assent, that the said treatise is\r\n    in all points so concordant and agreeable to holy scripture,\r\n    as we trust your majesty shall receive the same as a thing\r\n    most sincerely and purely handled, to the glory of God, your\r\n    grace’s honour, the unity of your people, the which things\r\n    your highness, we may well see and perceive, doth chiefly in\r\n    the same desire: yet we do most humbly submit it to the most\r\n    excellent wisdom and exact judgment of your majesty, to be\r\n    recognised, overseen, and corrected, if your grace shall find\r\n    any word or sentence in it meet to be changed, qualified,\r\n    or further expounded, for the plain setting forth of your\r\n    highness’s most virtuous desire and purpose in that behalf.\r\n    Whereunto we shall in that case conform ourselves, as to our\r\n    most bounden duties to God and to your highness appertaineth.”\r\n\r\nSigned by “your highness’ most humble subjects and daily beadsmen,\r\nThomas Cantuarien” and all the bishops.[290]\r\n\r\nA Church thus lying at the mercy of the temporal power, became a\r\nchattel in the hands of the class which controlled the revenue, and,\r\nfrom the Reformation to the revolution of 1688, this class consisted of\r\na comparatively few great landed families, forming a narrow oligarchy\r\nwhich guided the Crown. In the Middle Ages, a king had drawn his army\r\nfrom his own domain. Cœur-de-Lion had his own means of attack and\r\ndefence like any other baron, only on a larger scale. Henry VIII., on\r\nthe contrary, stood alone and helpless. As centralization advanced,\r\nthe cost of administration grew, until regular taxation had become\r\nnecessary, and yet taxes could only be levied by Parliament. The king\r\ncould hardly pay a body-guard, and such military force as existed\r\nwithin the realm obeyed the landlords. Had it not been for a few\r\nopulent nobles, like Norfolk and Shrewsbury, the Pilgrims of Grace\r\nmight have marched to London and plucked Henry from his throne, as\r\neasily as William afterward plucked James. These landlords, together\r\nwith the London tradesmen, carried Henry through the crisis of 1536,\r\nand thereafter he lay in their hands. His impotence appeared in every\r\nact of his reign. He ran the risk and paid the price, while others\r\nfattened on the plunder. The Howards, the Cecils, the Russells, the\r\nDudleys, divided the Church spoil among themselves, and wrung from the\r\nCrown its last penny, so that Henry lived in debt, and Edward faced\r\ninsolvency.\r\n\r\nDeeply as Mary abhorred sacrilege, she dared not ask for restitution to\r\nthe abbeys. Such a step would probably have caused her overthrow, while\r\nElizabeth never attempted opposition, but obeyed Cecil, the incarnation\r\nof the spirit of the oligarchy. The men who formed this oligarchy were\r\nof totally different type from anything which flourished in England\r\nin the imaginative age. Unwarlike, for their insular position made it\r\npossible for them to survive without the martial quality, they always\r\nshrank from arms. Nor were they numerous enough, or strong enough, to\r\noverawe the nation even in quiet times. Accordingly they generally\r\nlay inert, and only from necessity allied themselves with some more\r\nturbulent faction.\r\n\r\nThe Tudor aristocracy were rich, phlegmatic, and unimaginative men, in\r\nwhom the other faculties were subordinated to acquisition, and they\r\ntreated their religion as a financial investment. Strictly speaking,\r\nthe Church of England never had a faith, but vibrated between the\r\northodoxy of the “Six Articles,” and the Calvinism of the “Lambeth\r\nArticles,” according to the exigencies of real estate. Within a single\r\ngeneration, the relation Christ’s flesh and blood bore to the bread and\r\nwine was changed five times by royal proclamation or act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut if creeds were alike to the new economic aristocracy, it well\r\nunderstood the value of the pulpit as a branch of the police of the\r\nkingdom, and from the outset it used the clergy as part of the secular\r\nadministration. On this point Cranmer was explicit.[291] Elizabeth\r\nprobably represented the landed gentry more perfectly than any other\r\nsovereign, and she told her bishops plainly that she cared little for\r\ndoctrine, but wanted clerks to keep order. She remarked that she had\r\nseen it said:--\r\n\r\n   “that hir Protestants themselves misliked hir, and in deede so\r\n    they doe (quoth she) for I have heard that some of them of late\r\n    have said, that I was of no religion, neither hot nor cold, but\r\n    such a one, as one day would give God the vomit.... After this\r\n    she wished the bishops to look unto private Conventicles, and\r\n    now (quoth she) I miss my Lord of London who looketh no better\r\n    unto the Citty where every merchant must have his schoolemaster\r\n    and nightly conventicles.” [292]\r\n\r\nElizabeth ruled her clergy with a rod of iron. No priest was allowed\r\nto marry without the approbation of two justices of the peace, beside\r\nthe bishop, nor the head of a college without the leave of the visitor.\r\nWhen the Dean of St. Paul’s offended the queen in his sermon, she told\r\nhim “to retire from that ungodly digression and return to his text,”\r\nand Grindall was suspended for disobedience to her orders.\r\n\r\nIn Grindall’s primacy, monthly prayer meetings, called “prophesyings,”\r\ncame into fashion among the clergy. For some reason these meetings\r\ngave the government offence, and Grindall was directed to put a stop\r\nto them. Attacked thus, in the priests’ dearest rights, the archbishop\r\nrefused. Without more ado the old prelate was suspended, nor was he\r\npardoned until he made submission five years later.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of the Elizabethan bishops is filled with accounts\r\nof their thraldom. Pilkington, among others, complained that “We are\r\nunder authority, and cannot make any innovation without the sanction\r\nof the queen ... and the only alternative now allowed us is, whether we\r\nwill bear with these things or disturb the peace of the Church.”[293]\r\n\r\nEven ecclesiastical property continued to be seized, where it could\r\nbe taken safely; and the story of Ely House, although it has been\r\ndenied, is authentic in spirit. From the beginning of the Reformation\r\nthe London palaces of the bishops had been a tempting prize. Henry\r\ntook York House for himself, Raleigh had a lease of Durham House, and,\r\nabout 1565, Sir Christopher Hatton, whose relations with the queen\r\nwere hardly equivocal, undertook to force Bishop Cox to convey him Ely\r\nHouse. The bishop resisted. Hatton applied to the queen, and she is\r\nsaid to have cut the matter short thus:--\r\n\r\n   “Proud prelate: I understand you are backward in complying\r\n    with your agreement, but I would have you know that I who made\r\n    you what you are can unmake you, and if you do not forthwith\r\n    fulfil your engagement, by God, I will immediately unfrock you.\r\n    Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nHad the great landlords been either stronger, so as to have controlled\r\nthe blouse of Commons, or more military, so as to have suppressed it,\r\nEnglish ecclesiastical development would have been different. As it\r\nwas, a knot of ruling families, gorged with plunder, lay between the\r\nCatholics and the more fortunate of the evicted yeomen, who had made\r\nmoney by trade, and who hated and competed with them. Puritans as well\r\nas Catholics sought to unsettle titles to Church lands:--\r\n\r\n   “It is wonderfull to see how dispitefully they write of this\r\n    matter. They call us church robbers, devourers of holly things,\r\n    cormorantes, etc. affirminge that by the lawe of god, things\r\n    once consecrated to god for the service of this churche,\r\n    belong unto him for ever.... ffor my owne pte I have some\r\n    imppriations, etc. & I thanke god I keepe them w^{th} a good\r\n    conscience, and many wold be ondone. The law appveth us.”[294]\r\n\r\nThus beset, the landed capitalists struggled hard to maintain\r\nthemselves, and, as their best defence, they organized a body of\r\npriests to preach and teach the divine right of primogeniture, which\r\nbecame the distinctive dogma of this national church. Such at least was\r\nthe opinion of the non-jurors, who have always ranked among the most\r\northodox of the Anglican clergy, and who certainly were all who had the\r\nconstancy to suffer for their faith. John Lake, Bishop of Chichester,\r\nsuspended in 1689 for not swearing allegiance to William and Mary, on\r\nhis death-bed made the following statement:--\r\n\r\n   “That whereas I was baptized into the religion of the Church\r\n    of England, and sucked it in with my milk, I have constantly\r\n    adhered to it through the whole course of my life, and now,\r\n    if so be the will of God, shall dye in it; and I had resolved\r\n    through God’s grace assisting me to have dyed so, though at a\r\n    stake.\r\n\r\n   “And whereas that religion of the Church of England taught me\r\n    the doctrine of non-resistance and passive obedience, which I\r\n    have accordingly inculcated upon others, and which I took to be\r\n    the distinguishing character of the Church of England, I adhere\r\n    no less firmly and steadfastly to that, and in consequence of\r\n    it, have incurred a suspension from the exercise of my office\r\n    and expected a deprivation.”[295]\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century, the sovereign drew his supernatural quality\r\nfrom his consecration by the priesthood; in the seventeenth century,\r\nmoney had already come to represent a force so predominant that\r\nthe process had become reversed, and the priesthood attributed its\r\nprerogative to speak in the name of the Deity, to the interposition\r\nof the king. This was the substance of the Reformation in England.\r\nCranmer taught that God committed to Christian princes “the whole cure\r\nof all their subjects, as well concerning the administration of God’s\r\nword ... as ... of things political”; therefore bishops, parsons, and\r\nvicars were ministers of the temporal ruler, to whom he confided the\r\necclesiastical office, as he confided the enforcement of order to a\r\nchief of police.[296] As a part of the secular administration, the\r\nmain function of the Reformed priesthood was to preach obedience to\r\ntheir patrons; and the doctrine they evolved has been thus summed up by\r\nMacaulay:--\r\n\r\n   “It was gravely maintained that the Supreme Being regarded\r\n    hereditary monarchy, as opposed to other forms of government,\r\n    with peculiar favour; that the rule of succession in order\r\n    of primogeniture was a divine institution, anterior to the\r\n    Christian, and even to the Mosaic dispensation; that no human\r\n    power ... could deprive a legitimate prince of his rights;\r\n    that the authority of such a prince was necessarily always\r\n    despotic....”[297]\r\n\r\nIn no other department of public affairs did the landed gentry show\r\nparticular energy or ability. Their army was ineffective, their navy\r\nunequal to its work, their finances indifferently handled, but down to\r\nthe time of their overthrow, in 1688, they were eminently successful\r\nin ecclesiastical organization. They chose their instruments with\r\nprecision, and an oligarchy has seldom been more adroitly served.\r\nMacaulay was a practical politician, and Macaulay rated the clergy as\r\nthe chief political power under Charles II:--\r\n\r\n   “At every important conjuncture, invectives against the Whigs\r\n    and exhortations to obey the Lord’s anointed resounded at once\r\n    from many thousands of pulpits; and the effect was formidable\r\n    indeed. Of all the causes which, after the dissolution of the\r\n    Oxford Parliament, produced the violent reaction against the\r\n    exclusionists, the most potent seems to have been the oratory\r\n    of the country clergy.”[298]\r\n\r\nFor country squires a wage-earning clergy was safe, and although\r\nMacaulay’s famous passage describing their fear of an army has met with\r\ncontradiction, it probably is true:--\r\n\r\n   “In their minds a standing army was inseparably associated\r\n    with the Rump, with the Protector, with the spoliation of\r\n    the Church, with the purgation of the Universities, with the\r\n    abolition of the peerage, with the murder of the King, with\r\n    the sullen reign of the Saints, with cant and asceticism,\r\n    with fines and sequestrations, with the insults which Major\r\n    Generals, sprung from the dregs of the people, had offered to\r\n    the oldest and most honourable families of the kingdom. There\r\n    was, moreover, scarcely a baronet or a squire in the parliament\r\n    who did not owe part of his importance in his own county to his\r\n    rank in the militia. If that national force were set aside,\r\n    the gentry of England must lose much of their dignity and\r\n    influence.”[299]\r\n\r\nThe work to be done by the Tudor hierarchy was mercenary, not\r\nimaginative; therefore pastors had to be chosen who could be trusted to\r\nlabour faithfully for wages. Perhaps no equally large and intelligent\r\nbody of men has ever been more skilfully selected. The Anglican\r\npriests, as a body, have uniformly been true to the hand which fed\r\nthem, without regard to the principles they were required to preach.\r\nA remarkable instance of their docility, where loss of income was the\r\npenalty for disobedience, was furnished at the accession of William and\r\nMary. Divine right was, of course, the most sacred of Anglican dogmas,\r\nand yet, when the clergy were commanded to take the oath of allegiance\r\nto him whom they held to be an usurper, as Macaulay has observed,\r\n“some of the strongest motives which can influence the human mind, had\r\nprevailed. Above twenty-nine thirtieths of the profession submitted\r\nto the law.”[300] Moreover, the landlords had the economic instinct,\r\nbargaining accordingly, and Elizabeth bluntly told her bishops that\r\nthey must get her sober, respectable preachers, but men who should be\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\n   “Then spake my Lord Treasurer.... Her Maty hath declared unto\r\n    you a marvellous great fault, in that you make in this time\r\n    of light so many lewd and unlearned ministers.... It is the\r\n    Bishop of Litchfield ... that I mean, who made LXX. ministers\r\n    in one day for money, some taylors, some shoemakers, and other\r\n    craftsmen, I am sure the greatest part of them not worthy to\r\n    keep horses. Then said the Bp. of Rochester, that may be so,\r\n    for I know one that made 7 in one day, I would every man might\r\n    beare his own burthen, some of us have the greatest wrong\r\n    that can be offred.... But my Lord, if you would have none but\r\n    learned preachers to be admitted into the ministery, you must\r\n    provide better livings for them....\r\n\r\n   “To have learned ministers in every parish is in my judgm^{t}\r\n    impossible (quoth my Ld. of Canterbury) being 13,000 parishes\r\n    in Ingland, I know not how this realm should yield so many\r\n    learned preachers.\r\n\r\n   “Jesus (quoth the Queen) 13,000 it is not to be looked for, I\r\n    thinke the time hath been, there hath not been 4. preachers in\r\n    a diocesse, my meaning is not you should make choice of learned\r\n    ministers only for they are not to be found, but of honest,\r\n    sober, and wise men, and such as can reade the scriptures and\r\n    homilies well unto the people.”[301]\r\n\r\nThe Anglican clergy under the Tudors and the Stuarts were not so\r\nmuch priests, in the sense of the twelfth century, as hired political\r\nretainers. Macaulay’s celebrated description is too well known to need\r\nfull quotation: “for one who made the figure of a gentleman, ten were\r\nmere menial servants.... The coarse and ignorant squire” could hire a\r\n“young Levite” for his board, a small garret, and ten pounds a year.\r\nThis clergyman “might not only be the most patient of butts and of\r\nlisteners, might not only be always ready in fine weather for bowls,\r\nand in rainy weather for shovelboard, but might also save the expense\r\nof a gardener, or of a groom. Sometimes the reverend man nailed up the\r\napricots; and sometimes he curried the coach horses.”[302]\r\n\r\nYet, as Macaulay has also pointed out, the hierarchy was divided into\r\ntwo sections, the ordinary labourers and the managers. The latter were\r\nindispensable to the aristocracy, since without them their machine\r\ncould hardly have been kept in motion, and these were men of talent\r\nwho demanded and received good wages. Probably for this reason a\r\nlarge revenue was reserved for the higher secular clergy, and from the\r\noutset the policy proved successful. Many of the ablest organizers and\r\nastutest politicians of England, during the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies, sat on the episcopal bench, and two of the most typical,\r\nas well as the ablest Anglicans who ever lived, were the two eminent\r\nbishops who led the opposing wings of the Church when it was reformed\r\nby Henry VIII.: Stephen Gardiner and Thomas Cranmer.\r\n\r\nGardiner was the son of a clothworker of Bury Saint Edmunds, and was\r\nborn about 1483. At Cambridge he made himself the best civil lawyer of\r\nthe kingdom, and on meeting Wolsey, so strongly impressed him with his\r\ntalent that the cardinal advanced him rapidly, and in January 1529 sent\r\nhim to negotiate for the divorce at Rome. Nobody doubts that to the end\r\nof his life Gardiner remained a sincere Catholic, but above all else he\r\nwas a great Anglican. Becoming secretary to the king in June, 1529, as\r\nWolsey was tottering to his fall, he laboured to bring the University\r\nof Cambridge to the royal side, and he also devoted himself to Anne\r\nuntil he obtained the See of Winchester, when his efforts for the\r\ndivorce slackened. He even went so far as to assure Clement that he had\r\nrepented, and meant to quit the court, but notwithstanding he “bore up\r\nthe laps” of Anne’s robe at her coronation.\r\n\r\nIn 1535 the ways parted, a decision could not be deferred, he renounced\r\nRome and preached his sermon “de vera Obedientia,” in which he\r\nrecognized in Henry the supremacy of a Byzantine emperor. The pang\r\nthis act cost him lasted till he died, and he told the papal nuncio\r\n“he made this book under compulsion, not having the strength to suffer\r\ndeath patiently, which was ready for him.”[303] Indeed, when dying, his\r\napostacy seems to have been his last thought, for in his closing hours,\r\nas the story of the passion was read to him he exclaimed, “Negavi cum\r\nPetro, exivi cum Petro, sed nondum flevi cum Petro.” All his life long\r\nhis enemies accused him of dissimulation and hypocrisy for acts like\r\nthese, but it was precisely this quality which raised him to eminence.\r\nHad he not been purchasable, he could hardly have survived as an\r\nAnglican bishop; an enthusiast like Fisher would have ended on Tower\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more fully than any other prelate of his time, Gardiner\r\nrepresented the faction of Henry and Norfolk; he was as orthodox as he\r\ncould be and yet prosper. He hated Cromwell and all “gospellers,” and\r\nhe loved power and splendour and office. Fisher, with the temperament\r\nof Saint Anselm, shivering in his squalid house, clad in his shirt of\r\nhair, and sleeping on his pallet of straw, might indeed “humbly thank\r\nthe king’s majesty” who rid him of “all this worldly business,” but\r\nmen who rose to eminence in the reformed church were made of different\r\nstuff, and Gardiner’s ruling passion never burned more fiercely than as\r\nhe neared his death. Though in excruciating torments from disease, he\r\nclung to office to the last. Noailles, the French ambassador, at a last\r\ninterview, found him “livid with jaundice and bursting with dropsy: but\r\nfor two hours he held discourse with me calmly and graciously, without\r\na sign of discomposure; and at parting he must needs take my arm and\r\nwalk through three saloons, on purpose to show himself to the people,\r\nbecause they said that he was dead.”[304]\r\n\r\nGardiner was a man born to be a great prelate under a monied oligarchy,\r\nbut, gifted as he surely was, he must yield in glory to that wonderful\r\narchbishop who stamped the impress of his mind so deeply on the sect he\r\nloved, and whom most Anglicans would probably call, with Canon Dixon,\r\nthe first clergyman of his age. Cranmer was so supremely fitted to meet\r\nthe requirements of the economic revolution in which he lived, that he\r\nrose at a bound from insignificance to what was, for an Englishman, the\r\nsummit of greatness. In 1529, when the breach came, Gardiner already\r\nheld the place of chief secretary, while Cranmer remained a poor Fellow\r\nof Jesus. Within four years he had been consecrated primate, and he had\r\nbought his preferment by swearing allegiance to the pope, though he\r\nknew himself promoted for the express purpose of violating his oath,\r\nby decreeing the divorce which should sever England from Rome. His\r\nqualities were all recognized by his contemporaries; his adroitness,\r\nhis trustworthiness, and his flexibility. “Such an archbishop so\r\nnominated, and ... so and in such wise consecrated, was a meet\r\ninstrument for the king to work by ... a meet cover for such a cup;\r\nneither was there ever bear-ward that might more command his bears than\r\nthe king might command him.”[305] This judgment has always been held by\r\nChurchmen to be no small claim to fame; Burnet, for example, himself\r\na bishop and an admirer of his eminent predecessor, was clear that\r\nCranmer’s strength lay in that mixture of intelligence and servility\r\nwhich made him useful to those who paid him:--\r\n\r\n   “Cranmer’s great interest with the king was chiefly grounded on\r\n    some opinions he had of the ecclesiastical officers being as\r\n    much subject to the king’s power as all other civil officers\r\n    were.... But there was this difference: that Cranmer was once\r\n    of that opinion ... but Bonner against his conscience (if he\r\n    had any) complied with it.”[306]\r\n\r\nThe genius of the archbishop as a courtier may be measured by the fate\r\nwhich overtook his contemporaries. He was the fourth of Henry’s great\r\nministers, of whom Cromwell, Norfolk, and Wolsey were the other three.\r\nWolsey was disgraced, plundered, and hounded to death; Cromwell was\r\nbeheaded, and Norfolk was on his way to the scaffold, when saved by\r\nthe death of the man who condemned him. The priest alone, as Lutheran,\r\nor as worshipper of the miracle which he afterward denied, always kept\r\nthe sunshine of favour. Burnet has described how readily he violated\r\nhis oath by participating in the attempt to change the succession\r\nunder Edward, “He stood firm, and said, that he could not subscribe\r\nit without perjury; having sworn to the observance of King Henry’s\r\nwill.... The king himself required him to set his hand to the will....\r\nIt grieved him much; but such was the love that he bore to the king,\r\nthat in conclusion he yielded, and signed it.”[307] Like the chameleon,\r\nhe changed his colour to match the force which upheld him. Under\r\nEdward, he became radical as easily as he had sung the mass under the\r\n“Six Articles,” or as, under Mary, he pleaded to be allowed to return\r\nto Rome. Nor did he act thus from cowardice, for when he went to the\r\nfire, not a martyr of the Reformation showed more constancy than he.\r\nWith hardly an exception, Cranmer’s contemporaries suffered because\r\nthey could not entirely divest themselves of their scruples. Even\r\nGardiner had convictions strong enough to lodge him in the Tower, and\r\nBonner ended his days in the Marshalsea, rather than abjure again under\r\nElizabeth, but no such weakness hampered Cranmer. At Oxford, before his\r\nexecution, he recanted, in various forms, very many times, and would\r\ndoubtless have gone on recanting could he have saved himself by so\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nUnlike Gardiner, his convictions were evangelical, and he probably\r\nimbibed reformed principles quite early, for he married Ossiander’s\r\nniece when in Germany, before he became archbishop. Characteristically\r\nenough, he voted for the “Six Articles” in deference to Henry,[308]\r\nalthough the third section of the act provided death and forfeiture\r\nof goods for any priest who might marry. Afterward, he had to conceal\r\nhis wife and carry “her from place to place hidden from sight in a\r\nchest.”[309] Cranmer alleged at his trial that he had stayed orthodox\r\nregarding the sacrament until Ridley had converted him, after Henry’s\r\ndeath. But, leaving out of consideration the improbability of a man of\r\nCranmer’s remarkable acuteness being influenced by Ridley, the judgment\r\nof such a man as Foxe should have weight. Certainly, Foxe thought him\r\na “gospeller” at the time of Lambert’s trial, and nothing can give so\r\nvivid an idea of the lengths to which men of the Anglican type were\r\nready to go, as the account given by Foxe of the martyrdom of this\r\nsectary:--\r\n\r\n   “Lambert: ‘I answer, with Saint Augustine, that it is the body\r\n    of Christ, after a certain manner.’\r\n\r\n   “The King: ‘Answer me neither out of Saint Augustine, nor by\r\n    the authority of any other; but tell me plainly, whether thou\r\n    sayest it is the body of Christ, or no.’...\r\n\r\n   “Lambert: ‘Then I deny it to be the body of Christ.’\r\n\r\n   “The King: ‘Mark well! for now thou shalt be condemned even by\r\n    Christ’s own words, “Hoc est corpus meum.”’\r\n\r\n   “Then he commanded Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\n    to refute his assertion; who, first making a short preface\r\n    unto the hearers, began his disputation with Lambert very\r\n    modestly.... Then again the king and the bishops raged against\r\n    Lambert, insomuch that he was not only forced to silence,\r\n    but also might have been driven into a rage, if his ears had\r\n    not been acquainted with such taunts before.... And here it\r\n    is much to be marvelled at, to see how unfortunately it came\r\n    to pass in this matter, that ... Satan (who oftentimes doth\r\n    raise up one brother to the destruction of another) did here\r\n    perform the condemnation of this Lambert by no other ministers\r\n    than gospellers themselves, Taylor, Barnes, Cranmer, and\r\n    Cromwell; who, afterwards, in a manner, all suffered the like\r\n    for the gospel’s sake; of whom (God willing) we will speak\r\n    more hereafter.... Upon the day that was appointed for this\r\n    holy martyr of God to suffer, he was brought out of the prison\r\n    at eight o’clock in the morning unto the house of the lord\r\n    Cromwell, and so carried into his inward chamber, where, it\r\n    is reported of many, that Cromwell desired of him forgiveness\r\n    for what he had done.... As touching the terrible manner and\r\n    fashion of the burning of this blessed martyr, here is to be\r\n    noted, that of all others who have been burned and offered up\r\n    at Smithfield, there was yet none so cruelly and piteously\r\n    handled as he. For, after that his legs were consumed and\r\n    burned up to the stumps, and that the wretched tormentors and\r\n    enemies of God had withdrawn the fire from him, so that but a\r\n    small fire and coals were left under him, then two that stood\r\n    on each side of him, with their halberts pitched him upon their\r\n    pikes, as far as the chain would reach.... Then he, lifting up\r\n    such hands as he had, and his finger’s ends flaming with fire,\r\n    cried unto the people in these words, ‘None but Christ, none\r\n    but Christ;’ and so, being let down again from their halberts,\r\n    fell into the fire, and there ended his life.”[310]\r\n\r\nIn a hierarchy like the Anglican, whose function was to preach passive\r\nobedience to the representative of an opulent, but somewhat sluggish\r\noligarchy, there could be no permanent place for idealists. With a\r\nSpanish invasion threatening them, an unwarlike ruling class might\r\ntolerate sailors like Drake, or priests like Latimer; but, in the long\r\nrun, their interest lay in purging England of so dangerous an element.\r\nThe aristocracy sought men who could be bought; but such were of a\r\ndifferent type from Latimer, who, when they brought to him the fire,\r\nas he stood chained to the stake, “spake in this manner: ‘Be of good\r\ncomfort, master Ridley, and play the man. We shall this day light such\r\na candle, by God’s grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put\r\nout.’” And so, “after he had stroked his face with his hands, and as it\r\nwere bathed them a little in the fire, he soon died.”\r\n\r\nEcclesiastics like Latimer were apt to be of the mind of Knox, who\r\nheld “that sick as may and do brydill the inordinatt appetyteis of\r\nPrinces, cannot be accusit of resistance to the aucthoratie, quhilk\r\nis Godis gud ordinance.” And as the interests of landed capital were\r\nbound up with the maintenance of the royal prerogative, such men had\r\nto be eliminated. After the death of Mary, the danger apprehended by\r\nthe landed gentry was a Spanish invasion, coupled with a Catholic\r\ninsurrection, and therefore the policy of statesmen like Cecil was\r\nto foster hostility to Rome. Until after the Armada, Anglicans were\r\npermitted to go all lengths towards Geneva; even as late as 1595 the\r\n“Lambeth Articles” breathed pure Calvinism. But with the opening of\r\na new century, a change set in; as the power of Spain dwindled, rents\r\nrose, and the farmers grew restive at the precise moment when men of\r\nthe heroic temperament could be discarded. Raleigh was sent to the\r\nTower in 1603.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thorold Rogers, “good arable land [which] let at less than\r\na shilling an acre in the last quarter of the sixteenth century, was\r\nlet at 5s. to 6s. at the end of the first quarter of the seventeenth,”\r\nwhile rent for pasture doubled.[311] Rising rents, and prices tending\r\nto become stationary, caused suffering among the rural population,\r\nand with suffering came discontent. This discontent in the country\r\nwas fomented by restlessness in the towns, for commerce had been\r\nstrongly stimulated during the reign of Elizabeth by the Spanish wars,\r\nand the mercantile element began to rebel against legislation passed\r\nin the interest of the favoured class. Suddenly the dissatisfaction\r\nfound vent; for more than forty years the queen’s ministers had met\r\nwith no serious opposition in Parliament; in 1601, without warning,\r\ntheir system of monopolies was struck down, and from that day to the\r\nrevolution of 1688, the House of Commons proved to be unmanageable by\r\nthe Crown. Even as early as the accession of James, the competition\r\nbetween the aristocracy and their victims had begun to glow with the\r\nheat which presages civil war.\r\n\r\nHad the Tudor aristocracy been a martial caste, they would\r\ndoubtless have organized an army, and governed by the sword; but\r\nthey instinctively felt that, upon the field of battle, they might\r\nbe at a disadvantage, and therefore they attempted to control the\r\npopular imagination through the priesthood. Thus the divine right of\r\nprimogeniture came to be the distinguishing tenet of the Church of\r\nEngland. James felt the full force of the current which was carrying\r\nhim onward, and expressed the situation pithily in his famous apothegm,\r\n“No bishop, no king.” “I will have,” said he, “one doctrine, one\r\ndiscipline, one religion in substance and ceremony;” and the policy\r\nof the interest he represented was laid down as early as 1604, at the\r\nconference at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\nPassive obedience was to be preached, and the church filled with men\r\nwho could be relied on by the oligarchy. Six weeks after the conference\r\nat Hampton Court, Whitgift died, and Bancroft, Bishop of London, was\r\ntranslated to Canterbury. Within a week he was at work. He had already\r\nprepared a Book of Canons with which to test the clergy, and this he\r\nhad ratified by the convocation which preceded his consecration. In\r\nthese canons the divine origin of episcopacy was asserted; a strange\r\ndeparture from the doctrine of Cranmer. In 1605 there are supposed to\r\nhave been about fifteen hundred Puritan clergymen in England and Wales,\r\nand at Bancroft’s first winnowing three hundred were ejected.\r\n\r\nAmong these Puritans was a certain John Robinson, the teacher\r\nof a small congregation of yeomen, in the village of Scrooby, in\r\nNottinghamshire. The man’s birth is unknown, his early history is\r\nobscure, but in him, and in the farmers who heard him preach, the\r\nlong and bitter struggle against the pressure of the class which\r\nwas destroying them, had bred that stern and sombre enthusiasm which\r\nafterward marked the sect. By 1607 England had grown intolerable to\r\nthis congregation, and they resolved to emigrate. They had heard that\r\nin Holland liberty of conscience was allowed, and they fondly hoped\r\nthat with liberty of conscience they might be content to earn their\r\ndaily bread in peace. Probably with them, however, religion was not the\r\ncause, but the effect of their uneasiness, as the result proved.\r\n\r\nAfter many trials and sorrows, these poor people finally assembled in\r\nAmsterdam, and thence journeyed to Leyden, where they dwelt some eleven\r\nyears. But they found the struggle for life to be full as severe in the\r\nLow Countries as it had been at home, and presently the exiles began\r\nto long for some distant land where “they might more glorify God, do\r\nmore good to their country, better provide for their posterity, and\r\nlive to be more refreshed by their labours, than ever they could do in\r\nHolland.” Accordingly, obtaining a grant from the Virginia Company,\r\nthey sailed in the Mayflower in 1620, to settle in New England; and\r\nthus, by the eviction of the yeomen, England laid the foundation of one\r\ngreat province of her colonial empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSPAIN AND INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the words of Mr. Froude: “Before the sixteenth century had measured\r\nhalf its course the shadow of Spain already stretched beyond the Andes;\r\nfrom the mines of Peru and the custom-houses of Antwerp the golden\r\nrivers streamed into her imperial treasury; the crowns of Aragon and\r\nCastile, of Burgundy, Milan, Naples, and Sicily, clustered on the brow\r\nof her sovereigns.”[312] But with all their great martial qualities,\r\nthe Spaniards seem to have been incapable of attaining the same\r\nvelocity of movement as the races with which they had to compete. They\r\nnever emerged from the imaginative period, they never developed the\r\neconomic type, and in consequence they never centralized as the English\r\ncentralized. Even as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century\r\nthis peculiarity had been observed, for the Duke de Sully remarked that\r\nwith Spain the “legs and arms are strong and powerful, but the heart\r\ninfinitely weak and feeble.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Mahan has explained the military impotence of the mighty\r\nmass which, scattered over two continents, could not command the sea,\r\nand in the seventeenth century an intelligent Dutchman boasted that\r\n“the Spaniards have publicly begun to hire our ships to sail to the\r\nIndies.... It is manifest that the West Indies, being as the stomach to\r\nSpain (for from it nearly all the revenue is drawn), must be joined to\r\nthe Spanish head by a sea force”;[313] and the glory of the Elizabethan\r\nsailors lay not only in having routed this sea force, but in having\r\nassimilated no small portion of the nutriment which the American\r\nstomach should have supplied to the Spanish heart.\r\n\r\nAs Spain lingered long in the imaginative age, the priest and soldier\r\nthere reigned supreme after the mercantile and sceptical type had\r\nbegun to predominate elsewhere; and the instinct of the priest and\r\nsoldier has always been to exterminate their rivals when pressed by\r\ntheir competition. In the Spanish peninsula itself the Inquisition soon\r\ntrampled out heresy, but by the middle of the sixteenth century the\r\nLow Countries were a hotbed of Protestantism, and in Flanders these\r\nopposing forces fought out their battle to the death. The war which\r\nruined Antwerp made England.\r\n\r\nIn 1576 Antwerp was sacked and burned; in 1585 the town was reduced to\r\nstarvation by the Duke of Parma, and its commerce having been scattered\r\nby successive disasters, some of it migrated to Amsterdam, and some\r\nsought shelter in the Thames. In London the modern man was protected by\r\nthe sea, and the crisis of the combat came in 1588, when the Spaniards,\r\nhaving decided to pursue their enemy to his last stronghold, sent the\r\nArmada to perish in the Channel. With that supreme effort the vitality\r\nof the great imaginative empire began to fail, disintegration set in,\r\nand on the ruins of Spain rose the purely economic centralization of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nLike the Venetians, the British laid the basis of their high fortune\r\nby piracy and slaving, and their advantage over Spain lay not in\r\nmass, but in a superior energy, which gave them more rapid movement.\r\nDrake’s squadron, when he sailed round the world, numbered five ships,\r\nthe largest measuring only one hundred and twenty tons, the smallest\r\ntwelve, but with these he succeeded because of their speed. For\r\nexample, he overtook the Cacafuego, whose ballast was silver, and whose\r\ncargo gold and jewels. He never disclosed her value, but the Spanish\r\ngovernment afterward proved a loss of a million and a half of ducats,\r\nbeside the property of private individuals. In like manner the Armada\r\nwas destroyed by little ships, which sailed round their clumsy enemy,\r\nand disabled him before he could strike a blow in self-defence.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish wars were halcyon days for the men of martial blood who\r\nhad lost their land; they took to the sea by thousands, and ravaged\r\nthe Spanish colonies with the energy and ferocity of vikings. For\r\nnearly a generation they wallowed in gold and silver and gems, and in\r\nthe plunder of the American towns. Among these men Sir Francis Drake\r\nstood foremost, but, after 1560, the southern counties swarmed with\r\npirates; and when, in 1585, Drake sailed on his raid against the West\r\nIndies, he led a force of volunteers twenty-five hundred strong. He\r\nheld no commission, the crews of his twenty-five ships served without\r\npay, they went as buccaneers to fatten on the commerce of the Spaniard.\r\nAs it happened, this particular expedition failed financially, for\r\nthe treasure fleet escaped, and the plunder of the three cities of\r\nSantiago, Saint Domingo, and Carthagena yielded only £60,000, but the\r\ninjury done to Spain was incalculable.\r\n\r\nNo computation can be attempted of the spoil taken during these years;\r\nno reports were ever made; on the contrary, all concerned were anxious\r\nto conceal their doings, but certain prizes were too dazzling to be\r\nhidden. When Drake surprised three caravans on the Isthmus, numbering\r\none hundred and ninety mules, each mule loaded with three hundred\r\npounds of silver, the fact became known. No wonder Drake ate off\r\n“silver richly gilt, and engraved with his arms,” that he had “all\r\npossible luxuries, even to perfumes,” that he dined and supped “to the\r\nmusic of violins,” and that he could bribe the queen with a diamond\r\ncross and a coronet set with splendid emeralds, and give the lord\r\nchancellor a service of plate. What he gave in secret he alone knew.\r\n\r\nAs Francis Drake was the ideal English corsair, so John Hawkins was\r\nthe ideal slaver. The men were kinsmen, and of the breed which, when\r\ndriven from their farms at the end of the Middle Ages, left their mark\r\nall over the world. Of course the two sailors were “gospellers,” and\r\nMr. Froude has quoted an interesting passage from the manuscript of a\r\ncontemporary Jesuit, which shows how their class was esteemed toward\r\nthe close of the sixteenth century: “The only party that would fight\r\nto the death for the queen, the only real friends she had, were the\r\nPuritans, the Puritans of London, the Puritans of the sea towns.”[314]\r\nThese the priest thought desperate and determined men. Nevertheless\r\nthey sometimes provoked Elizabeth by their sermonizing. The story is\r\ntold that one day after reading a letter of Hawkins to Burleigh she\r\ncried: “God’s death! This fool went out a soldier, and has come back a\r\ndivine.”\r\n\r\nThough both Drake and Hawkins possessed the predatory temperament,\r\nHawkins had a strong commercial instinct, and kept closely to trade.\r\nHe was the son of old William Hawkins, the first British captain\r\nwho ever visited Brazil, and who brought from thence a native\r\nchief, whom he presented to Henry VIII. As a young man John had\r\ndiscovered at the Canaries “that negroes were a very good commodity\r\nin Hispaniola,”[315] and that they might easily be taken on the coast\r\nof Guinea. Accordingly, in 1562, he fitted out three ships, touched at\r\nSierra Leone, and “partly by the sword and partly by other means,” he\r\nobtained a cargo, “and with that prey he sailed over the ocean sea” to\r\nHispaniola, where he sold his goods at a large profit. The West India\r\nIslands, and the countries bordering the Gulf of Mexico, cannot be\r\ncultivated profitably by white labourers; therefore, when the Spaniards\r\nhad, by hard usage, partially exterminated the natives, a fresh supply\r\nof field hands became necessary, and these could be had easily and\r\ncheaply on the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nAt first Spain tried to exclude foreigners from this most lucrative\r\ntraffic; but here again the English moved too quickly to be stopped.\r\nWherever Hawkins went, he went prepared to fight, and, if prevented\r\nfrom trading peaceably, he used force. In his first voyage he met with\r\nno opposition, but subsequently, at Burburata, leave to sell was denied\r\nhim, and, without an instant’s hesitation, he marched against the town\r\nwith “a hundred men well armed,” and brought the governor to terms.\r\nHaving supplied all the slaves needed at that port, Hawkins went on to\r\nRio de la Hacha, where he, in like manner, made a demonstration with\r\n“one hundred men in armour,” and two small guns, and in ten days he had\r\ndisposed of his whole stock.\r\n\r\nAs at that time an able negro appears to have been worth about £160\r\nin the West Indies,[316] a cargo of five hundred ought to have netted\r\nbetween seventy and eighty thousand pounds, for the cost of kidnapping\r\nwas trifling. No wonder, therefore, that slaving flourished, and that,\r\nby the middle of the eighteenth century, England probably carried\r\nnot far from one hundred thousand blacks annually from Africa to the\r\ncolonies. The East offered no such market, and doubtless Adam Smith\r\nwas right in his opinion that the commerce with India had never been so\r\nadvantageous as the trade to America.[317]\r\n\r\nBoth slavers and pirates brought bullion to England, and presently\r\nthis flow of silver began to stimulate at London a certain amount of\r\nexchange between the East and West. The Orientals have always preferred\r\npayment in specie, and, as silver has usually offered more profit than\r\ngold as an export, the European with a surplus of silver has had the\r\nadvantage over all competitors. Accordingly, until Spain lost the power\r\nto protect her communications with her mines, the Spanish peninsula\r\nenjoyed almost a monopoly of the trade beyond the Cape; but as the war\r\nwent on, and more of the precious metal flowed to the north, England\r\nand Holland began to send their silver to Asia, the Dutch organizing\r\none East India Company in 1595, and the British another in 1600.\r\n\r\nSir Josiah Child, who was, perhaps, the ablest merchant of the\r\nseventeenth century, observed that in 1545 “the trade of England then\r\nwas inconsiderable, and the merchants very mean and few.”[318] Child’s\r\nfacts are beyond doubt, and the date he fixed is interesting because\r\nit coincides with the discovery of Potosi, whence most of the silver\r\ncame which supplied the pirates and the slavers. Prior to 1545 specie\r\nhad been scarce in London, but when the buccaneers had been scuttling\r\ntreasure galleons for a generation, they found themselves possessed of\r\nenough specie to set them dreaming of India, and thus piracy laid the\r\nfoundation of the British empire in Asia.\r\n\r\nBut robbing the Spaniards had another more immediate and more startling\r\nresult, for it probably precipitated the civil war. As the city grew\r\nrich it chafed at the slow movement of the aristocracy, who, timid\r\nand peaceful, cramped it by closing the channels through which it\r\nreached the property of foreigners; and, just when the yeomanry were\r\nexasperated by rising rents, London began to glow with that energy\r\nwhich, when given vent, was destined to subdue so large a portion\r\nof the world. Perhaps it is not going too far to say that, even from\r\nthe organization of the East India Company, the mercantile interest\r\ncontrolled England. Not that it could then rule alone, it lacked the\r\npower to do so for nearly a hundred years to come; but, after 1600,\r\nits weight turned the scale on which side soever thrown. Before the\r\nLong Parliament the merchants were generally Presbyterians or moderate\r\nPuritans; the farmers, Independents or Radicals; and Winthrop, when\r\npreparing for the emigration to Massachusetts, dealt not only with\r\nsquires like Hampden, but with city magnates like Thomas Andrews, the\r\nlord mayor. This alliance between the rural and the urban Puritans\r\ncarried through the Great Rebellion, and as their coalition crushed the\r\nmonarchy so their separation reinstated it.\r\n\r\nMacaulay has very aptly observed that “but for the hostility of the\r\ncity, Charles the First would never have been vanquished, and that,\r\nwithout the help of the city, Charles the Second could scarcely\r\nhave been restored.”[319] At the Protector’s death the Presbyterians\r\nabandoned the farmers, probably because they feared them. The army of\r\nthe Commonwealth swarmed with men like Cromwell and Blake, warriors\r\nresistless alike on land and sea, with whom, when organized, the city\r\ncould not cope. Therefore it scattered them, and, throwing in its lot\r\nwith the Cavaliers, set up the king.\r\n\r\nFor about a generation after the Restoration, no single interest had\r\nthe force to impose its will upon the nation, or, in other words,\r\nparties were equally balanced; but from the middle of the century the\r\ntide flowed rapidly. Capital accumulated, and as it accumulated the\r\nmen adapted to be its instruments grew to be the governing class.\r\nSir Josiah Child is the most interesting figure of this period.\r\nHis acquaintance remembered him a poor apprentice sweeping the\r\ncounting-house where he worked; and yet, at fifty, his fortune reached\r\n£20,000 a year, a sum almost equal to the rent-roll of the Duke of\r\nOrmond, the richest peer of the realm. Child married his daughter to\r\nthe eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, and gave her £50,000, and his\r\nability was so commanding that for years he absolutely ruled the East\r\nIndia Company, and used its revenues to corrupt Parliament. On matters\r\nof finance such a man would hardly err, and he gave it as his opinion\r\nthat in 1635 “there were more merchants to be found upon the Exchange\r\nworth each one thousand pounds and upwards, than were in the former\r\ndays, viz., before the year 1600, to be found worth one hundred pounds\r\neach.”\r\n\r\n   “And now ... there are more men to be found upon the Exchange\r\n    now worth ten thousand pounds estates, than were then of one\r\n    thousand pounds. And if this be doubted, let us ask the aged,\r\n    whether five hundred pounds portion with a daughter sixty years\r\n    ago, were not esteemed a larger portion than two thousand\r\n    pounds is now; and whether gentlewomen in those days would\r\n    not esteem themselves well clothed in a serge gown, which a\r\n    chambermaid now will be ashamed to be seen in.... We have now\r\n    almost one hundred coaches for one we had formerly. We with\r\n    ease can pay a greater tax now in one year than our forefathers\r\n    could in twenty. Our customs are very much improved, I believe\r\n    above the proportion aforesaid, of six to one; which is not\r\n    so much in advance of the rates of goods as by increase of the\r\n    bulk of trade....\r\n\r\n   “I can myself remember since there were not in London used so\r\n    many wharves or keys for the landing of merchants’ goods, by\r\n    at least one third part, as now there are, and those that were\r\n    then could scarce have employment for half what they could\r\n    do; and now, notwithstanding one-third more used to the same\r\n    purpose, they are all too little, in time of peace, to land the\r\n    goods at, that come to London.”[320]\r\n\r\nChild estimated that, within twenty years, wages had risen one-third,\r\nand rents twenty-five per cent, while “houses new-built in London\r\nyield twice the rent they did before the fire.”[321] Farms that “their\r\ngrandfathers or fathers bought or sold fifty years past ... would\r\nyield, one with another, at least treble the money, and in some cases,\r\nsix times the money, they were then bought and sold for.”[322] Macaulay\r\nhas estimated the population of London in 1685 at half a million, and\r\nbelieved it to have then become the largest city in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy were forced to tolerate men of the predatory type\r\nwhile they feared a Spanish invasion, but after the defeat of the\r\nArmada these warriors became dangerous at home, and the oligarchy,\r\nvery naturally, tried to purge the island of a class which constantly\r\nmenaced their authority. Persecution drove numbers of Nonconformists to\r\nAmerica, and the story of Captain John Smith shows how hardly society\r\nthen pressed on the race of adventurers, even where the bitterness of\r\nthe struggle did not produce religious enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nSmith lived a generation too late. Born in 1579, he was a child of\r\nnine when the Armada perished, and only sixteen when Drake and Hawkins\r\ndied at sea. Smith’s father had property, but when left an orphan his\r\nguardians neglected him, and at fifteen let him set out on his travels\r\nwith only ten shillings in his pocket. At home no career was open to\r\nhim, for the Cecils rather inclined to imprison and behead soldiers\r\nof fortune than to reward them. Accordingly he went abroad, and by\r\ntwenty-five had seen service in most countries of the Continent, had\r\nbeen enslaved by the Turks, had escaped and wandered to Barbary, had\r\nfought the Spanish on a French man-of-war, and at last had learned that\r\nthe dreams of his youth belonged to a past age, and that he must enter\r\na new path. He therefore joined himself to a party bound for Virginia,\r\nand the hardship of the times may be gauged by the fact that out of a\r\ncompany of a hundred, fifty-two were gentlemen adventurers as needy as\r\nhimself, none of whom sought exile for religion.\r\n\r\nSmith’s voyages to America brought him nothing but bitterness. He\r\nreturned to England and passed his last years in obscurity and neglect,\r\nand perhaps the fate that awaited soldiers under James, has been\r\nnowhere better told than in Smith’s own words. He spent five years\r\nand more than five hundred pounds in the service of Virginia and New\r\nEngland, yet “in neither ... have I one foot of land, nor the very\r\nhouse I builded, nor the ground I digged with my own hands, nor ever\r\nany content or satisfaction at all, and though I see ordinarily those\r\ntwo countries shared before me by them that neither have them, nor know\r\nthem but by my descriptions.”[323]\r\n\r\nAs long as the Tudor aristocracy ruled, Great Britain afforded small\r\ncomfort for men like Smith. That aristocracy had genius neither for\r\nadventure nor for war, and few Western nations have a sorrier military\r\nhistory than England under the Stuarts. Yet beneath the inert mass of\r\nthe nobility seethed an energy which was to recentralize the world;\r\nand when capital had accumulated to a certain point, the men who gave\r\nit an outlet laid their grasp upon the State. In 1688 the commercial\r\nadventurers conquered the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe change was radical; at once social, political, and religious. The\r\nstronghold of the Tories had been the royal prerogative. The victors\r\nlodged the power of the Crown in a committee chosen by the House of\r\nCommons. The dogma of divine right immediately vanished, and with it\r\nall that distinguished Anglicanism. Though perverted by the Tudors,\r\nthis great tenet of the Church of Henry VIII. had been at least a\r\nsurvival of an imaginative age; and when the merchants swept it away,\r\nall trace of idealism departed. Thenceforward English civilization\r\nbecame a purely materialistic phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as movement accelerates societies consolidate, and as\r\nsocieties consolidate they pass through a profound intellectual change.\r\nEnergy ceases to find vent through the imagination, and takes the form\r\nof capital; hence as civilizations advance, the imaginative temperament\r\ntends to disappear, while the economic instinct is fostered, and thus\r\nsubstantially new varieties of men come to possess the world.\r\n\r\nNothing so portentous overhangs humanity as this mysterious and\r\nrelentless acceleration of movement, which changes methods of\r\ncompetition and alters paths of trade; for by it countless millions\r\nof men and women are foredoomed to happiness or misery, as certainly\r\nas the beasts and trees, which have flourished in the wilderness, are\r\ndestined to vanish when the soil is subdued by man.\r\n\r\nThe Romans amassed the treasure by which they administered their\r\nEmpire, through the plunder and enslavement of the world. The Empire\r\ncemented by that treasure crumbled when adverse exchanges carried\r\nthe bullion of Italy to the shore of the Bosphorus. An accelerated\r\nmovement among the semi-barbarians of the West caused the agony of the\r\ncrusades, amidst which Constantinople fell as the Italian cities rose;\r\nwhile Venice and Genoa, and with them the whole Arabic civilization,\r\nshrivelled, when Portugal established direct communication with\r\nHindostan.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the ocean as a highroad precipitated the Reformation,\r\nand built up Antwerp, while in the end it ruined Spain; and finally\r\nthe last great quickening of the age of steam, which centralized the\r\nworld at London, bathed the earth in blood, from the Mississippi to the\r\nGanges. Thus religions are preached and are forgotten, empires rise and\r\nfall, philosophies are born and die, art and poetry bloom and fade, as\r\nsocieties pass from the disintegration wherein the imagination kindles,\r\nto the consolidation whose pressure ends in death.\r\n\r\nIn 1688, when the momentum of England suddenly increased, the change\r\nwas equivalent to the conquest of the island by a new race. Among the\r\nfamily of European nations, Great Britain rose as no people had risen\r\nsince the Punic Wars. Almost instantly she entered on a career of\r\nconquest unparalleled in modern history. Of the hundred and twenty-five\r\nyears between the Boyne and Waterloo, she passed some seventy in waging\r\nferocious wars, from which she emerged victorious on land and sea, the\r\nmistress of a mighty empire, the owner of incalculable wealth, and the\r\ncentre of the world’s exchanges. Then, from this culminating point of\r\nexpansion by conquest, she glided subtly, and almost imperceptibly,\r\ninto the period of contraction, as Rome went before her under the\r\nCæsars.\r\n\r\nAlthough abundant metallic currency does not, probably, of itself,\r\ncreate mercantile prosperity, such prosperity is hardly compatible with\r\na shrinking stock of money; for when contraction sets in and prices\r\nfall, producers and debtors are ruined, as they were ruined in Italy\r\nunder the later emperors. Toward the close of the seventeenth century\r\nEurope appeared to be on the brink of such a contraction, for though\r\nPeru had lavishly replenished the supply of the precious metals a\r\nhundred years previously, the drain to Asia and the increasing demands\r\nof commerce had been so considerable, that the standard coin had\r\ngenerally depreciated. From the reign of Augustus downward, commerce\r\nbetween Europe and Asia has usually favoured Asia, and this was\r\nparticularly true of the seventeenth century, when the value of bullion\r\nfell in the West, and therefore encouraged lavish exports to the East,\r\nwhere it retained its purchasing power. According to Adam Smith, “the\r\nbanks of Venice, Genoa, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and Nuremberg, seem to\r\nhave been all originally established” to provide an ideal currency for\r\nthe settlement of bills of exchange, and the money “of such banks,\r\nbeing better than the common currency of the country, necessarily\r\nbore an agio, which was greater or smaller, according as the currency\r\nwas supposed to be more or less degraded below the standard of the\r\nState.”[324] Smith estimated the depreciation at Hamburg at fourteen\r\nper cent, and at Amsterdam, early in the previous century, at nine per\r\ncent; in short, all European countries suffered, but in England the\r\nevil reached a climax through the inertia of the new aristocracy.\r\n\r\nIn England, silver had always been the standard, and by the third year\r\nof Elizabeth the coin had been restored to its proper fineness, which\r\nthenceforward was scrupulously maintained. But though the metal was not\r\ndegraded by the government, the stock of bullion, if not constantly\r\nreplenished from without, tended to diminish in proportion to the\r\ngrowth of the country and the export of specie to Asia. After the\r\ndiscovery of America, the value of silver in relation to gold fell, in\r\nEurope, to about fourteen or fifteen to one, while in China or India\r\nit stood pretty steady at from ten to twelve to one. Consequently\r\nfrom 1600 downward, silver remained the most profitable cargo which\r\ncould be sent round the Cape of Good Hope, and, unhappily for British\r\nprosperity, at the very moment when the East India Company came into\r\nbeing, piracy ceased. The chief supply of bullion being thus cut off,\r\nthe strain of the export trade fell upon the coin, and within a little\r\nmore than a generation the effect become apparent in a degeneration of\r\nthe currency.\r\n\r\nTo make good her position as a centre of exchanges, England had no\r\nchoice but to supply her necessities by force. Cromwell understood the\r\nsituation perfectly, and had hardly assumed the office of Protector\r\nwhen he laid plans to cut the evil at the root by conquering Spanish\r\nAmerica, and robbing Spain of her mines. To this end he fitted out\r\nhis great expedition against Saint Domingo, which was to serve him as\r\nhis base; but for once his military genius failed him, his commanders\r\nblundered, the attack miscarried, and the island of Jamaica was all\r\nthat came of the campaign.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, that no time might be lost while fighting for the\r\nmines themselves, Cromwell sent Blake to intercept the treasure ships\r\noff the coast of Spain. At first Blake also had ill-luck. In 1655 the\r\nplate fleet escaped him, but the next year, though forced himself to\r\ngo to port for supplies, he detached Captain Stayner, with six sail,\r\nto cruise off Cadiz, and on September 19, General Montague was able\r\nto report that his “hart [was] very much warmed with the apprehension\r\nof the singular providence of God,” who had permitted Stayner to\r\nmeet, “with the Kinge of Spain’s West India fleete,” and take among\r\nother prizes “a gallion reported to have in her two million pieces\r\nof plate.”[325] If the “plate” were Mexican “pieces of eight” at four\r\nshillings and sixpence, the cargo was worth £450,000, or considerably\r\nmore than the whole annual export to the East at the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Had the Protector lived, there can be little\r\ndoubt that, by some such means as this, he would have fostered British\r\nresources, and maintained the integrity of British coin; but in less\r\nthan two years from the date of Montague’s dispatch, Cromwell was dead,\r\nand the inertia of the Tory landlords paralyzed the nation for another\r\ngeneration. No foreigner was robbed, and the stock of domestic silver\r\ndwindled from year to year, until at the Revolution the golden guinea,\r\nwhich, from its first issue in 1662 down to the accession of William\r\nand Mary, had been nominally current for twenty shillings, actually\r\nsold in the market for thirty shillings of the money in use.\r\n\r\n   “This diminishing and counterfeiting the money was at this\r\n    time so excessive, that what was good silver was worth scarcely\r\n    one-half of its current value, whilst a great part of the coins\r\n    was only iron, brass, or copper plated, and some no more than\r\n    washed over.”[326]\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the new government was a complete recoinage,\r\nwhich was finished in 1699; but the measure failed of its purpose, for\r\nthe reason that the exports of silver regularly exceeded the imports.\r\n\r\nIn 1717, a committee of the House of Lords considered the condition\r\nof the currency, and Lord Stanhope then explained very lucidly the\r\ncause of the scarcity of silver. Among other papers he produced a\r\nreport from the Custom House, by which it appeared that, in the year\r\n1717, “the East India Company had exported near three million ounces\r\nof silver, which far exceeding the imports of the bullion in that\r\nyear, it necessarily followed that vast quantities of silver specie\r\nmust have been melted down, both to make up the export, and to supply\r\nthe silversmith.”[327] For the decade from 1711 to 1720 the annual\r\nexport of bullion by the East India Company averaged £434,000.[328]\r\nAt the accession of George III., in 1760, Lord Liverpool estimated\r\nthat shillings had lost one-sixth, and sixpences one-quarter of\r\ntheir original weight, while the crown-piece had almost wholly\r\ndisappeared.[329] Even Adam Smith admitted that because of this outflow\r\nsilver had risen in value, and probably purchased “a larger quantity\r\nboth of labour and commodities” than it otherwise would.[330]\r\n\r\nIn this emergency the British merchants showed the resource which has\r\nalways been their characteristic, and, in default of an adequate supply\r\nof specie, relieved the strain upon their currency by issuing paper.\r\nMediæval banking had gone no further than the establishment of reserves\r\nof coin, to serve as a medium for clearing bills of exchange; the\r\nEnglish took the great step of accelerating the circulation of their\r\nmoney, by using this reserve as a basis for a paper currency which\r\nmight be largely expanded. The Bank of England was incorporated in\r\n1694, the Bank of Scotland in 1695, and the effect was unquestionably\r\nconsiderable. Adam Smith has thus described the impetus received by\r\nGlasgow:--\r\n\r\n   “The effects of it have been precisely those above described.\r\n    The business of the country is almost entirely carried on\r\n    by means of the paper of those different banking companies,\r\n    with which purchases and payments of all kinds are commonly\r\n    made. Silver very seldom appears except in the change of\r\n    a twenty shillings bank note, and gold still seldomer. But\r\n    though the conduct of all those different companies has not\r\n    been unexceptionable ... the country, notwithstanding, has\r\n    evidently derived great benefit from their trade. I have\r\n    heard it asserted, that the trade of the city of Glasgow\r\n    doubled in about fifteen years after the first erection of\r\n    the banks there; and that the trade of Scotland has more than\r\n    quadrupled since the first erection of the two public banks at\r\n    Edinburgh.”[331]\r\n\r\nBut although by this means a certain degree of relief was given, and\r\nthough prices rose slowly throughout the first half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the fundamental difficulty remained. There was insufficient\r\nsilver for export, exchanges were adverse, and that stock of coined\r\nmoney was lacking which is the form in which force clothes itself in\r\nhighly centralized communities. How England finally supplied her needs\r\nis one of the most dramatic pages of history.\r\n\r\nAs Jevons has aptly observed, Asia is “the great reservoir and sink of\r\nthe precious metals.” From time immemorial the Oriental custom has been\r\nto hoard, and from the Mogul blazing with the diamonds of Golconda,\r\nto the peasant starving on his wretched pittance, every Hindoo had, in\r\nformer days, a treasure stored away against a day of trouble. Year by\r\nyear, since Pizarro had murdered the Inca Atahualpa for his gold, a\r\nstream of bullion had flowed from America to Europe, and from Europe\r\nto the East: there it had vanished as completely as though once more\r\nburied in the bowels of the mine. These hoards, the savings of millions\r\nof human beings for centuries, the English seized and took to London,\r\nas the Romans had taken the spoil of Greece and Pontus to Italy. What\r\nthe value of the treasure was, no man can estimate, but it must have\r\nbeen many millions of pounds--a vast sum in proportion to the stock\r\nof the precious metals then owned by Europeans. Some faint idea of the\r\nbooty of the conqueror may be drawn from Macaulay’s description of the\r\nfirst visit of an English soldier to an Oriental treasure chamber:--\r\n\r\n   “As to Clive, there was no limit to his acquisitions but his\r\n    own moderation. The treasury of Bengal was thrown open to him.\r\n    There were piled up, after the usage of Indian princes, immense\r\n    masses of coin, among which might not seldom be detected the\r\n    florins and byzants with which, before any European ship had\r\n    turned the Cape of Good Hope, the Venetians purchased the\r\n    stuffs and spices of the East. Clive walked between heaps of\r\n    gold and silver, crowned with rubies and diamonds, and was at\r\n    liberty to help himself.”[332]\r\n\r\nThe lives of few men are better known than those of Clive and Hastings,\r\nand yet there are few whose influence upon the fate of mankind has had\r\nsuch scant appreciation. It is not too much to say that the destiny of\r\nEurope hinged upon the conquest of Bengal. Robert Clive was of the same\r\nstock as Drake and Hawkins, Raleigh, Blake, and Cromwell; he was the\r\neldest son of one of those small farmers whose ancestors had held their\r\nland ever since the Conquest, and who, when at last evicted and driven\r\nout to sea, had fought and conquered on every continent and on every\r\nocean. Among the throng of great English adventurers none is greater\r\nthan he.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1725, and from childhood displayed those qualities which\r\nmade him pre-eminent on the field of battle; fighting was his delight,\r\nand so fierce was his temper that his family could not control him. At\r\nlast, when eighteen, his father gladly sent him to Madras as a clerk in\r\nthe service of the East India Company; and there, in a torrid climate\r\nwhich shattered his health, poor and neglected, lonely and forlorn,\r\nhe pined, until in melancholy he twice attempted suicide. But he was\r\ndestined to found an empire, and at last his hour came.\r\n\r\nWhen Clive went to India, the Company was still a purely commercial\r\nconcern, holding only the land needed for its warehouses, and having\r\nin their pay a few ill-disciplined sepoys. In the year 1746, when\r\nClive was twenty-one, the war of the Austrian Succession was raging,\r\nand suddenly a French fleet, commanded by Labourdonnais, appeared off\r\nMadras, and attacked Fort Saint George. Resistance was hopeless, the\r\nplace surrendered, and the governor and chief inhabitants were taken\r\nto Pondicherry. Clive, however, managed to escape, and, volunteering,\r\nreceived an ensign’s commission, and began his military career.\r\n\r\nShortly after, peace was made in Europe, but in India the issue of the\r\nstruggle lay undecided between the French and English, the prize being\r\nthe peninsula. Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, was a man\r\nof commanding intellect, who first saw the possibility of constructing\r\na European empire in Hindostan by controlling native princes. Following\r\nup his idea, he mixed in a war of succession, and having succeeded\r\nin establishing a sovereign of the Deccan, he made himself master of\r\nSouthern India. The Nizam’s treasure was thrown open to him, and beside\r\nmany jewels of price, he is said to have appropriated two hundred\r\nthousand pounds in coin. This was the man whom Clive, when only a clerk\r\nof twenty-five, without military education or experience, attacked and\r\noverthrew.\r\n\r\nClive began his campaigns by the capture and defence of Arcot, one\r\nof the most daring deeds of a generation given over to perpetual\r\nwar. Aided by their native allies, the French had laid siege to\r\nTrichinopoly, and Clive represented to his superiors that with the\r\nfate of Trichinopoly was bound up the fate of the whole peninsula. He\r\nrecommended making a diversion by assaulting Arcot, the capital of the\r\nCarnatic; his plan met with approval, and, with two hundred Europeans\r\nand three hundred sepoys, he marched to fight the greatest power in\r\nthe East. He succeeded in surprising and occupying the town without\r\nloss, but when within the city his real peril began. Arcot had neither\r\nditches nor defensible ramparts, the English were short of provisions,\r\nand the Nabob hurried forward ten thousand men to relieve his capital.\r\nWith four officers, one hundred and twenty British, and two hundred\r\nsepoys, Clive held the town for fifty days, and when the enemy\r\nassaulted for the last time he served his own guns. He won a decisive\r\nvictory, and from that hour was recognized as among the most brilliant\r\nofficers of the world.\r\n\r\nOther campaigns followed, but his health, undermined by the tropics,\r\ngave way, and at twenty-seven he returned home to squander his money\r\nand contest an election to Parliament. He soon reached the end of\r\nhis resources, and, just before the opening of the Seven Years’ War,\r\nhe accepted a lieutenant-colonel’s commission, and set sail to take\r\ncommand in Hindostan. The Company appointed him governor of Fort Saint\r\nDavid, a settlement near Madras; but he had hardly assumed his office\r\nbefore an event occurred which caused the conquest of Bengal. The Nabob\r\nof Bengal captured Calcutta, and imprisoned one hundred and forty-six\r\nof the English residents in the “Black Hole,” where, in a single night,\r\none hundred and twenty-three perished.\r\n\r\nClive was summoned, and acted with his usual vigour. He routed the\r\nNabob’s army, recovered Calcutta, and would have taken vengeance at\r\nonce had not the civilians, who wanted to be restored to their places,\r\ninterfered.\r\n\r\nLong and tortuous negotiations followed, in which Clive displayed\r\nmore than Oriental cunning and duplicity, ending in a march into\r\nthe interior and the battle of Plassey. There, with one thousand\r\nEnglish and two thousand sepoys, he met and crushed the army of the\r\nNabob, sixty thousand strong. On June 23, 1757, one of the richest\r\nprovinces of Asia lay before him defenceless, ripe for plunder. Eight\r\nhundred thousand pounds were sent down the Hooghly to Calcutta, in one\r\nshipment; Clive himself took between two and three hundred thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nLike Drake and Hawkins, Clive had done great things for England, but\r\nhe was a military adventurer, one of the class in whom the aristocracy\r\nrecognized an enemy; and though in London he was treated with outward\r\nrespect, and even given an Irish peerage, the landed interest hated\r\nhim, and tried to destroy him, as in the next generation it tried to\r\ndestroy Hastings.\r\n\r\nUpon the plundering of India there can be no better authority than\r\nMacaulay, who held high office at Calcutta when the administration of\r\nHastings was still remembered; and who less than any of the writers who\r\nhave followed him, was a mouth-piece of the official class.[333] He has\r\ntold how after Plassey “the shower of wealth” began to fall, and he has\r\ndescribed Clive’s own gains: “We may safely affirm that no Englishman\r\nwho started with nothing has ever, in any line of life, created such\r\na fortune at the early age of thirty-four.”[334] But the takings of\r\nClive, either for himself or for the government, were trifling compared\r\nto the wholesale robbery and spoliation which followed his departure,\r\nwhen Bengal was surrendered a helpless prey to a myriad of greedy\r\nofficials. These officials were absolute, irresponsible, and rapacious,\r\nand they emptied the private hoards. Their only thought was to wring\r\nsome hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the natives as quickly as\r\npossible, and hurry home to display their wealth.\r\n\r\n   “Enormous fortunes were thus rapidly accumulated at Calcutta,\r\n    while thirty millions of human beings were reduced to the\r\n    extremity of wretchedness.” “The misgovernment of the English\r\n    was carried to a point such as seems hardly compatible with the\r\n    very existence of society. The Roman proconsul, who, in a year\r\n    or two, squeezed out of a province the means of rearing marble\r\n    palaces and baths on the shores of Campania, of drinking from\r\n    amber, of feasting on singing birds, of exhibiting armies of\r\n    gladiators and flocks of camelopards; the Spanish viceroy, who,\r\n    leaving behind him the curses of Mexico or Lima, entered Madrid\r\n    with a long train of gilded coaches, and of sumpter-horses\r\n    trapped and shod with silver, were now outdone.”[335]\r\n\r\nThus treasure in oceans flowed into England through private hands,\r\nbut in India the affairs of the Company went from bad to worse.\r\nMisgovernment impoverished the people, the savings of long years of\r\ntoil were exhausted, and when, in 1770, a drought brought famine, the\r\nresources of the people failed, and they perished by millions: “the\r\nvery streets of Calcutta were blocked up by the dying and the dead.”\r\nThen came an outbreak of wrath from disappointed stockholders; the\r\nlanded interest seized its opportunity to attack Clive in Parliament;\r\nand the merchants chose Hastings to develop the resources of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nAs Sheridan said, the Company “extended the sordid principles of their\r\norigin over all their successive operations; connecting with their\r\ncivil policy, and even with their boldest achievements, the meanness\r\nof a pedlar and the profligacy of pirates.” In Hastings the Company\r\nfound a man fitted to their hands, a statesman worthy to organize a\r\nvast empire on an economic basis. Able, bold, cool, and relentless, he\r\ngrasped the situation at a glance, and never faltered in his purpose.\r\nIf more treasure was to be wrung from the natives, force had to be\r\nused systematically. Though Bengal might be ruined, the hoards of the\r\nneighbouring potentates remained safe, and these Hastings deliberately\r\nset himself to drain. Macaulay has explained the policy and the motives\r\nwhich actuated him:--\r\n\r\n   “The object of his diplomacy was at this time simply to get\r\n    money. The finances of his government were in an embarrassed\r\n    state, and this embarrassment he was determined to relieve\r\n    by some means, fair or foul. The principle which directed all\r\n    his dealings with his neighbours is fully expressed by the old\r\n    motto of one of the great predatory families of Teviotdale,\r\n    ‘Thou shalt want ere I want.’ He seems to have laid it down, as\r\n    a fundamental proposition which could not be disputed, that,\r\n    when he had not as many lacs of rupees as the public service\r\n    required, he was to take them from anybody who had. One thing,\r\n    indeed, is to be said in excuse for him. The pressure applied\r\n    to him by his employers at home, was such as only the highest\r\n    virtue could have withstood, such as left him no choice except\r\n    to commit great wrongs, or to resign his high post, and with\r\n    that post all his hopes of fortune and distinction.”[336]\r\n\r\nHow he obtained his money, the pledges he violated, and the blood he\r\nspilt, is known as few passages of history are known, for the story\r\nhas been told by Macaulay and by Burke. How he robbed the Nabob of\r\nBengal of half the income the Company had solemnly promised to pay,\r\nhow he repudiated the revenue which the government had covenanted\r\nto yield to the Mogul as a tribute for provinces ceded them, and\r\nhow, in consideration of four hundred thousand pounds, he sent a\r\nbrigade to slaughter the Rohillas, and placidly saw “their villages\r\nburned, their children butchered, and their women violated,” has\r\nbeen described in one of the most popular essays in the language.\r\nAt Hastings’ impeachment, the heaviest charge against him was that\r\nbased on his conduct toward the princesses of Oude, whom his creature,\r\nAsaph-ul-Dowlah, imprisoned and starved, whose servants he tormented,\r\nand from whom he wrung at last twelve hundred thousand pounds, as the\r\nprice of blood. By these acts, and acts such as these, the treasure\r\nwhich had flowed to Europe through the extermination of the Peruvians,\r\nwas returned again to England from the hoards of conquered Hindoos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMODERN CENTRALIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn discussing the phenomena of the highly centralized society in\r\nwhich he lived, Mill defined capital “as the accumulated stock of\r\nhuman labour.” In other words, capital may be considered as stored\r\nenergy; but most of this energy flows in fixed channels, money alone\r\nis capable of being transmuted immediately into any form of activity.\r\nTherefore the influx of the Indian treasure, by adding considerably to\r\nthe nation’s cash capital, not only increased its stock of energy, but\r\nadded much to its flexibility and the rapidity of its movement.\r\n\r\nVery soon after Plassey the Bengal plunder began to arrive in London,\r\nand the effect appears to have been instantaneous, for all authorities\r\nagree that the “industrial revolution,” the event which has divided the\r\nnineteenth century from all antecedent time, began with the year 1760.\r\nPrior to 1760, according to Baines, the machinery used for spinning\r\ncotton in Lancashire was almost as simple as in India;[337] while\r\nabout 1750 the English iron industry was in full decline because of the\r\ndestruction of the forests for fuel. At that time four-fifths of the\r\niron in use in the kingdom came from Sweden.\r\n\r\nPlassey was fought in 1757, and probably nothing has ever equalled\r\nthe rapidity of the change which followed. In 1760 the flying-shuttle\r\nappeared, and coal began to replace wood in smelting. In 1764\r\nHargreaves invented the spinning-jenny, in 1779 Crompton contrived the\r\nmule, in 1785 Cartwright patented the power-loom, and, chief of all,\r\nin 1768 Watt matured the steam-engine, the most perfect of all vents\r\nof centralizing energy. Hut though these machines served as outlets\r\nfor the accelerating movement of the time, they did not cause that\r\nacceleration. In themselves inventions are passive, many of the most\r\nimportant having lain dormant for centuries, waiting for a sufficient\r\nstore of force to have accumulated to set them working. That store must\r\nalways take the shape of money, and money not hoarded, but in motion.\r\n\r\nThus printing had been known for ages in China before it came to\r\nEurope; the Romans probably were acquainted with gunpowder; revolvers\r\nand breech-loading cannon existed in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, and steam had been experimented upon long before the\r\nbirth of Watt. The least part of Watt’s labour lay in conceiving\r\nhis idea; he consumed his life in marketing it. Before the influx of\r\nthe Indian treasure, and the expansion of credit which followed, no\r\nforce sufficient for this purpose existed; and had Watt lived fifty\r\nyears earlier, he and his invention must have perished together.\r\nConsidering the difficulties under which Matthew Boulton, the ablest\r\nand most energetic manufacturer of his time, nearly succumbed, no\r\none can doubt that without Boulton’s works at Birmingham the engine\r\ncould not have been produced, and yet before 1760 such works could\r\nnot have been organized. The factory system was the child of the\r\n“industrial revolution,” and until capital had accumulated in masses\r\ncapable of giving solidity to large bodies of labour, manufactures\r\nwere necessarily carried on by scattered individuals, who combined a\r\nhandicraft with agriculture. Defoe’s charming description of Halifax\r\nabout the time Boulton learned his trade, is well known:--\r\n\r\n   “The nearer we came to Halifax, we found the houses thicker,\r\n    and the villages greater, in every bottom; ... for the land\r\n    being divided into small enclosures, from two acres to six or\r\n    seven each, seldom more, every three or four pieces of land had\r\n    an house belonging to them.\r\n\r\n   “In short, after we had mounted the third hill, we found the\r\n    country one continued village, tho’ every way mountainous,\r\n    hardly an house standing out of a speaking distance from\r\n    another; and, as the day cleared up, we could see at every\r\n    house a tenter, and on almost every tenter a piece of cloth,\r\n    kersie, or shalloon; which are the three articles of this\r\n    countries labour....\r\n\r\n   “This place then seems to have been designed by providence for\r\n    the very purposes to which it is now allotted.... Nor is the\r\n    industry of the people wanting to second these advantages. Tho’\r\n    we met few people without doors, yet within we saw the houses\r\n    full of lusty fellows, some at the dye vat, some at the loom,\r\n    others dressing the cloths; the women and children carding, or\r\n    spinning; all employed from the youngest to the oldest; scarce\r\n    anything above four years old, but its hands were sufficient\r\n    for its own support. Not a beggar to be seen, nor an idle\r\n    person, except here and there in an alms-house, built for those\r\n    that are antient, and past working. The people in general live\r\n    long; they enjoy a good air; and under such circumstances hard\r\n    labour is naturally attended with the blessing of health, if\r\n    not riches.”[338]\r\n\r\nTo the capitalist, then, rather than to the inventor, civilization\r\nowes the steam engine as a part of daily life, and Matthew Boulton was\r\none of the most remarkable of the race of producers whose reign lasted\r\ndown to Waterloo. As far back as tradition runs the Boultons appear\r\nto have been Northamptonshire farmers, but Matthew’s grandfather met\r\nwith misfortunes under William, and sent his son to Birmingham to seek\r\nhis fortune in trade. There the adventurer established himself as a\r\nsilver stamper, and there, in 1728, Matthew was born. Young Boulton\r\nearly showed both energy and ingenuity, and on coming of age became\r\nhis father’s partner, thenceforward managing the business. In 1759,\r\ntwo years after the conquest of Bengal, the father died, and Matthew,\r\nhaving married in 1760, might have retired on his wife’s property, but\r\nhe chose rather to plunge more deeply into trade. Extending his works,\r\nhe built the famous shops at Soho, which he finished in 1762 at an\r\noutlay of £20,000, a debt which probably clung to him to the end of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBoulton formed his partnership with Watt in 1774, and then began to\r\nmanufacture the steam-engine, but he met with formidable difficulties.\r\nBefore the sales yielded any return, the outlay reduced him to the\r\nbrink of insolvency; nor did he achieve success until he had exhausted\r\nhis own and his friends’ resources.\r\n\r\n   “He mortgaged his lands to the last farthing; borrowed from his\r\n    personal friends; raised money by annuities; obtained advances\r\n    from bankers; and had invested upwards of forty thousand pounds\r\n    in the enterprise before it began to pay.”[339]\r\n\r\nAgriculture, as well as industry, felt the impulsion of the new force.\r\nArthur Young remarked in 1770, that within ten years there had been\r\n“more experiments, more discoveries, and more general good sense\r\ndisplayed in the walk of agriculture than in an hundred preceding\r\nones”; and the reason why such a movement should have occurred seems\r\nobvious. After 1760 a complex system of credit sprang up, based on a\r\nmetallic treasure, and those who could borrow had the means at their\r\ndisposal of importing breeds of cattle, and of improving tillage, as\r\nwell as of organizing factories like Soho. The effect was to cause\r\nrapid centralization. The spread of high farming certainly raised the\r\nvalue of land, but it also made the position of the yeomanry untenable,\r\nand nothing better reveals the magnitude of the social revolution\r\nwrought by Plassey, than the manner in which the wastes were enclosed\r\nafter the middle of the century. Between 1710 and 1760 only 335,000\r\nacres of the commons were absorbed; between 1760 and 1843, nearly\r\n7,000,000. In eighty years the yeomanry became extinct. Many of these\r\nsmall farmers migrated to the towns, where the stronger, like the\r\nancestor of Sir Robert Peel, accumulated wealth in industry, the weaker\r\nsinking into factory hands. Those who lingered on the land, toiled as\r\nday labourers.\r\n\r\nPossibly since the world began, no investment has ever yielded the\r\nprofit reaped from the Indian plunder, because for nearly fifty years\r\nGreat Britain stood without a competitor. That she should have so\r\nlong enjoyed a monopoly seems at first mysterious, but perhaps the\r\ncondition of the Continent may suggest an explanation. Since Italy\r\nhad been ruined by the loss of the Eastern trade, she had ceased to\r\nbreed the economic mind; consequently no class of her population could\r\nsuddenly and violently accelerate their movements. In Spain the priest\r\nand soldier had so thoroughly exterminated the sceptic, that far from\r\ncentralizing during the seventeenth century, as England and France\r\nhad done, her empire was in full decline at the revolution of 1688. In\r\nFrance something similar had happened, though in a much less degree.\r\nAfter a struggle of a century and a half, the Church so far prevailed\r\nin 1685 as to secure the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. At the\r\nrevocation many Huguenots went into exile, and thus no small proportion\r\nof the economic class, who should have pressed England hardest, were\r\ndriven across the Channel, to add their energy to the energy of the\r\nnatives. Germany lacked capital. Hemmed in by enemies, and without\r\na seacoast, she had been at a disadvantage in predatory warfare;\r\naccordingly she did not accumulate money, and failed to consolidate\r\nuntil, in 1870, she extorted a treasure from France. Thus, in 1760,\r\nHolland alone remained as a competitor, rich, maritime, and peopled\r\nby Protestants. But Holland lacked the mass possessed by her great\r\nantagonist, beside being without minerals; and accordingly, far from\r\naccelerating her progress, she proved unable to maintain her relative\r\nrate of advance.\r\n\r\nThus isolated, and favoured by mines of coal and iron, England not only\r\ncommanded the European and American markets, at a time when production\r\nwas strained to the utmost by war, but even undersold Hindoo labour\r\nat Calcutta. In some imperfect way her gains may be estimated by\r\nthe growth of her debt, which must represent savings. In 1756, when\r\nClive went to India, the nation owed £74,575,000, on which it paid an\r\ninterest of £2,753,000. In 1815 this debt had swelled to £861,000,000,\r\nwith an annual interest charge of £32,645,000. In 1761 the Duke of\r\nBridgewater finished the first of the canals which were afterward to\r\nform an inland water-way costing £50,000,000, or more than two-thirds\r\nof the amount of the public debt at the outbreak of the Seven Years’\r\nWar. Meanwhile, also, steam had been introduced, factories built,\r\nturnpikes improved, and bridges erected, and all this had been done\r\nthrough a system of credit extending throughout the land. Credit is the\r\nchosen vehicle of energy in centralized societies, and no sooner had\r\ntreasure enough accumulated in London to offer it a foundation, than it\r\nshot up with marvellous rapidity.\r\n\r\nFrom 1694 to Plassey, the growth had been relatively slow. For more\r\nthan sixty years after the foundation of the Bank of England, its\r\nsmallest note had been for £20, a note too large to circulate freely,\r\nand which rarely travelled far from Lombard Street. Writing in 1790,\r\nBurke mentioned that when he came to England in 1750 there were not\r\n“twelve bankers’ shops” in the provinces, though then, he said, they\r\nwere in every market town.[340] Thus the arrival of the Bengal silver\r\nnot only increased the mass of money, but stimulated its movement;\r\nfor at once, in 1759, the bank issued £10 and £15 notes, and, in the\r\ncountry, private firms poured forth a flood of paper. At the outbreak\r\nof the Napoleonic wars, there were not far from four hundred provincial\r\nhouses, many of more than doubtful solvency. Macleod, who usually\r\ndoes not exaggerate such matters, has said, that grocers, tailors, and\r\ndrapers inundated the country with their miserable rags.[341]\r\n\r\nThe cause of this inferiority of the country bankers was the avarice\r\nof the Bank of England, which prevented the formation of joint stock\r\ncompanies, who might act as competitors; and, as the period was one\r\nof great industrial and commercial expansion, when the adventurous\r\nand producing classes controlled society, enough currency of some\r\nkind was kept in circulation to prevent the prices of commodities from\r\ndepreciating relatively to coin. The purchasing power of a currency is,\r\nother things being equal, in proportion to its quantity. Or, to put the\r\nproposition in the words of Locke, “the value of money, in general,\r\nis the quantity of all the money in the world in proportion to all\r\nthe trade.”[342] At the close of the eighteenth century, many causes\r\ncombined to make money plentiful, and therefore to cheapen it. Not only\r\nwas the stock of bullion in England increased by importations from\r\nIndia, but, for nearly a generation, exports of silver to Asia fell\r\noff. From an average of £600,000 annually between 1740 and 1760, the\r\nshipments of specie by the East India Company fell to £97,500 between\r\n1760 and 1780; nor did they rise to their old level until after the\r\nclose of the administration of Hastings, when trade returned to normal\r\nchannels. After 1800 the stream gathered volume, and between 1810\r\nand 1820 the yearly consignment amounted to £2,827,000, or to nearly\r\none-half of the precious metals yielded by the mines.\r\n\r\nFrom the crusades to Waterloo, the producers dominated Europe, the\r\nmoney-lenders often faring hardly, as is proved by the treatment of the\r\nJews. From the highest to the lowest, all had wares to sell; the farmer\r\nhis crop, the weaver his cloth, the grocer his goods, and all were\r\ninterested in maintaining the value of their merchandise relatively\r\nto coin, for they lost when selling on a falling market. By degrees,\r\nas competition sharpened after the Reformation, a type was developed\r\nwhich, perhaps, may be called the merchant adventurer; men like Child\r\nand Boulton, bold, energetic, audacious. Gradually energy vented itself\r\nmore and more freely through these merchants, until they became the\r\nruling power in England, their government lasting from 1688 to 1815.\r\nAt length they fell through the very brilliancy of their genius. The\r\nwealth they amassed so rapidly, accumulated, until it prevailed over\r\nall other forms of force, and by so doing raised another variety of man\r\nto power. These last were the modern bankers.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the bankers, a profound change came over\r\ncivilization, for contraction began. Self-interest had from the outset\r\ntaught the producer that, to prosper, he should deal in wares which\r\ntended rather to rise than fall in value, relatively to coin. The\r\nopposite instinct possessed the usurer; he found that he grew rich when\r\nmoney appreciated, or when the borrower had to part with more property\r\nto pay his debt when it fell due, than the cash lent him would have\r\nbought on the day the obligation was contracted. As, toward the close\r\nof the eighteenth century, the great hoards of London passed into the\r\npossession of men of the latter type, the third and most redoubtable\r\nvariety of the economic intellect arose to prominence, a variety of\r\nwhich perhaps the most conspicuous example is the family of Rothschild.\r\n\r\nIn one of the mean and dirty houses of the Jewish quarter of Frankfort,\r\nMayer Amschel was born in the year 1743. The house was numbered 152 in\r\nthe Judengasse, but was better known as the house of the Red Shield,\r\nand gave its name to the Amschel family. Mayer was educated by his\r\nparents for a rabbi; but, judging himself better fitted for finance,\r\nhe entered the service of a Hanoverian banker named Oppenheim, and\r\nremained with him until he had saved enough to set up for himself. Then\r\nfor some years he dealt in old coins, curiosities and bullion, married\r\nin 1770, returned to Frankfort, established himself in the house of the\r\nRed Shield, and rapidly advanced toward opulence. Soon after he gave up\r\nhis trade in curiosities, confining himself to banking, and his great\r\nstep in life was made when he became “Court Jew” to the Landgrave of\r\nHesse. By 1804 he was already so prosperous that he contracted with the\r\nDanish Government for a loan of four millions of thalers.\r\n\r\nMayer had five sons, to whom he left his business and his wealth. In\r\n1812 he died, and, as he lay upon his death-bed, his last words were,\r\n“You will soon be rich among the richest, and the world will belong\r\nto you.”[343] His prophecy came true. These five sons conceived and\r\nexecuted an original and daring scheme. While the eldest remained at\r\nFrankfort, and conducted the parent house, the four others migrated to\r\nfour different capitals, Naples, Vienna, Paris, and London, and, acting\r\ncontinually in consort, they succeeded in obtaining a control over\r\nthe money market of Europe, as unprecedented as it was lucrative to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOf the five brothers, the third, Nathan, had commanding ability. In\r\n1798 he settled in London, married in 1806 the daughter of one of the\r\nwealthiest of the English Jews, and by 1815 had become the despot of\r\nthe Stock Exchange; “peers and princes of the blood sat at his table,\r\nclergymen and laymen bowed before him.” He had no tastes, either\r\nliterary, social, or artistic; “in his manners and address he seemed\r\nto delight in displaying his thorough disregard of all the courtesies\r\nand amenities of civilized life”; and when asked about the future\r\nof his children he said, “I wish them to give mind, soul, and heart,\r\nand body--everything to business. That is the way to be happy.”[344]\r\nExtremely ostentatious, though without delicacy or appreciation,\r\n“his mansions were crowded with works of art, and the most gorgeous\r\nappointments.” His benevolence was capricious; to quote his own words,\r\n“Sometimes to amuse myself I give a beggar a guinea. He thinks it is\r\na mistake, and for fear I shall find it out off he runs as hard as\r\nhe can. I advise you to give a beggar a guinea sometimes. It is very\r\namusing.”[345]\r\n\r\nThough an astonishingly bold and unscrupulous speculator, Nathan\r\nprobably won his chief successes by skill in lending, and, in this\r\nbranch of financiering, he was favoured by the times in which he lived.\r\nDuring the long wars Europe plunged into debt, contracting loans in\r\ndepreciated paper, or in coin which was unprecedentedly cheap because\r\nof the abundance of the precious metals.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1809, prices reached the greatest altitude they ever\r\nattained in modern, or even, perhaps, in all history. There is\r\nsomething marvellously impressive in this moment of time, as the\r\nworld stood poised upon the brink of a new era. To the contemporary\r\neye Napoleon had reached his zenith. Everywhere victorious, he had\r\ndefeated the English in Spain, and forced the army of Moore to embark\r\nat Corunna; while at Wagram he had brought Austria to the dust. He\r\nseemed about to rival Cæsar, and establish a military empire which\r\nshould consolidate the nations of the mainland of Europe. Yet in\r\nreality one of those vast and subtle changes was impending, which, by\r\nmodifying the conditions under which men compete, alter the complexion\r\nof civilizations, and which has led in the course of the nineteenth\r\ncentury to the decisive rejection of the martial and imaginative mind.\r\n\r\nIn April 1810 Bolivar obtained control at Caracas, and, with\r\nthe outbreak of the South American revolutions, the gigantic\r\nbut imaginative empire of Spain passed into the acute stage of\r\ndisintegration. On December 19 of the same year, the Emperor Alexander\r\nopened the ports of Russia to neutral trade. By so doing Alexander\r\nrepudiated the “continental system” of Napoleon, made a breach with him\r\ninevitable, and thus brought on the campaign of Moscow, the destruction\r\nof the Grand Army, and the close of French military triumphs on the\r\nhill of Waterloo. From the year 1810, nature has favoured the usurious\r\nmind, even as she favoured it in Rome, from the death of Augustus.\r\n\r\nMoreover, both in ancient and modern life, the first symptom of this\r\nprofound economic and intellectual revolution was identical. Tacitus\r\nhas described the panic which was the immediate forerunner of the\r\nrise of the precious metals in the first century; and in 1810 a\r\nsimilar panic occurred in London, when prices suddenly fell fifteen\r\nper cent,[346] and when the most famous magnate of the Stock Exchange\r\nwas ruined and killed. The great houses of Baring and of Goldsmid had\r\nundertaken the negotiation of a government loan of £14,000,000. To\r\nthe surprise of these eminent financiers values slowly receded, and,\r\nin September, the death of Sir Francis Baring precipitated a crisis;\r\nAbraham Goldsmid, reduced to insolvency, in despair committed suicide;\r\nthe acutest intellects rose instantaneously upon the corpses of the\r\nweaker, and the Rothschilds remained the dictators of the markets of\r\nthe world. From that day to this the slow contraction has continued,\r\nwith only the break of little more than twenty years, when the gold of\r\nCalifornia and Australia came in an overwhelming flood; and, from that\r\nday to this, the same series of phenomena have succeeded one another,\r\nwhich eighteen hundred years ago marked the emasculation of Rome.\r\n\r\nAt the peace, many causes converged to make specie rise; the exports of\r\nbullion to the East nearly doubled; America grew vigorously, and mining\r\nwas interrupted by the revolt of the Spanish colonies. Yet favourable\r\nas the position of the creditor class might be, it could be improved\r\nby legislation, and probably no financial policy has ever been so ably\r\nconceived, or so adroitly executed, as that masterpiece of state-craft\r\nwhich gave Lombard Street control of the currency of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of the producers, values had generally been equalized\r\nby cheapening the currency when prices fell. In the fourteenth,\r\nfifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, the penny had been systematically\r\ndegraded, to keep pace with the growing dearth of silver. When the\r\nflood of the Peruvian bullion had reached its height in 1561, the\r\ncurrency regained its fineness; but in 1601 the penny lost another\r\nhalf-grain of weight, and, though not again adulterated at the mint,\r\nthe whole coinage suffered so severely from hard usage that, under\r\nthe Stuarts, it fell to about two-thirds of its nominal value. A\r\nre-coinage took place under William, but then paper came in to give\r\nrelief, and the money in circulation continued to degenerate, as there\r\nwas no provision for the withdrawal of light pieces. By 1774, the loss\r\nupon even the guinea had become so great that Parliament intervened,\r\nand Lord North recommended “that all the deficient gold coin should\r\nbe called in, and re-coined” and also that the “currency of the gold\r\ncoin should, in future, be regulated by weight as well as by tale ...\r\nand that the several pieces should not be legal tender, if they were\r\ndiminished, by wearing or otherwise, below a certain weight, to be\r\ndetermined by proclamation.”[347]\r\n\r\nBy such means as this, the integrity of the metallic money was at\r\nlength secured; but the emission of paper remained unlimited, and in\r\n1797 even the Bank of England suspended cash payments. Then prices\r\nadvanced as they had never advanced before, and, during the first ten\r\nyears of the nineteenth century, the commercial adventurers reached\r\ntheir meridian. From 1810 they declined in power; but for several\r\npreceding generations they had formed a true aristocracy, shaping the\r\nlaws and customs of their country. They needed an abundant currency,\r\nand they obtained it through the Bank. On their side the directors\r\nrecognized this duty to be their chief function, and laid it down\r\nas a principle that all legitimate commercial paper should always be\r\ndiscounted. If interest rose, the rise proved a dearth of money, and\r\nthey relieved that dearth with notes.\r\n\r\nLord Overstone has thus explained the system of banking which was\r\naccepted, without question, until 1810: “A supposed obligation to\r\nmeet the real wants of commerce, and to discount all commercial bills\r\narising out of legitimate transactions, appears to have been considered\r\nas the principle upon which the amount of the circulation was to\r\nbe regulated.”[348] And yet, strangely enough, even the adversaries\r\nof this system admitted that it worked well. A man as fixed in his\r\nopinions as Tooke, could not contain his astonishment that “under the\r\nguidance of maxims and principles so unsound and of such apparently\r\nmischievous tendency, as those professed by the governors and some\r\nof the directors of the Bank in 1810, such moderation and ... such\r\nregularity of issue should, under chances and changes in politics and\r\ntrade, unprecedented in violence and extent, have been preserved, as\r\nthat a spontaneous readjustment between the value of the gold and the\r\npaper should have taken place, as it did, without any reduction of\r\ntheir circulation.”[349]\r\n\r\nWith such a system the currency tended to fall rather than to rise in\r\nvalue, in comparison with commodities, and for this reason the owners\r\nof the great hoards were at a disadvantage. What powerful usurers, like\r\nRothschild, wanted, was a legal tender fixed in quantity, which, being\r\nunable to expand to meet an increased demand, would rise in price.\r\nMoreover, they needed a circulating medium sufficiently compact to be\r\ncontrolled by a comparatively small number of capitalists, who would\r\nthus, under favourable conditions, hold the whole debtor community at\r\ntheir mercy.\r\n\r\nIf the year 1810 be taken as the point at which the energy stored in\r\naccumulations of money began to predominate in England, the revolution\r\nwhich ended in the overthrow of the producers, advanced, with hardly a\r\ncheck, to its completion by the “Bank Act” of 1844. The first symptom\r\nof approaching change was the famous “Bullion Committee,” appointed on\r\nthe motion of Francis Horner in 1810. This report is most interesting,\r\nfor it marks an epoch, and in it the struggle for supremacy between the\r\nlender and the borrower is brought out in full relief. To the producer,\r\nthe commodity was the measure of value; to the banker, coin. The\r\nproducer sought a currency which should retain a certain ratio to all\r\ncommodities, of which gold was but one. The banker insisted on making a\r\nfixed weight of the metal he controlled, the standard from which there\r\nwas no appeal.\r\n\r\nA distinguished merchant, named Chambers, in his evidence before the\r\nCommittee, put the issue in a nutshell:--\r\n\r\n    _Q._ “At the Mint price of standard gold in this country, how\r\n    much gold does a Bank of England note for one pound represent?\r\n\r\n    _A._ “5 dwts. 3 grs.\r\n\r\n    _Q._ “At the present market price of standard gold of £4 12.\r\n    per ounce, how much gold do you get for a Bank of England note\r\n    for one pound?\r\n\r\n    _A._ “4 dwts. 8 grs.\r\n\r\n    _Q._ “Do you consider that a Bank of England note for one\r\n    pound, under these present circumstances, is exchangeable in\r\n    gold for what it represents of that metal?\r\n\r\n    _A._ “I do not conceive gold to be a fairer standard for Bank\r\n    of England notes than indigo or broadcloth.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the bankers controlled the “Bullion Committee,” the mercantile\r\ninterest still maintained itself in Parliament, and the resolutions\r\nproposed by the chairman in his report were rejected in the Commons\r\nby a majority of about two to one. The tide, however, had turned, and\r\nperhaps the best index of the moment at which the balance of power\r\nshifted, may be the course of Peel. Of all the public men of his\r\ngeneration, Peel had the surest instinct for the strongest force.\r\nRarely, if ever, did this instinct fail him, and after 1812 his\r\nintuition led him to separate from his father; as, later in life, it\r\nled him to desert his party in the crisis of 1845. The first Sir Robert\r\nPeel, the great manufacturer, who made the fortune of the family,\r\nhad the producer’s instinct and utterly opposed contraction. In 1811\r\nhe voted against the report of the Bullion Committee, and then his\r\nson voted with him. After 1816, however, the younger Peel became the\r\nspokesman of Lombard Street, and the story is told that when the bill\r\nproviding for cash payments passed in July, 1819, the old man, after\r\nlistening to his son’s great speech, said with bitterness: “Robert has\r\ndoubled his fortune, but ruined his country.”[350]\r\n\r\nProbably Waterloo marked the opening of the new era, for after\r\nWaterloo the bankers met with no serious defeat. At first they hardly\r\nencountered opposition. They began by discarding silver. In 1817\r\nthe government made 123 374⁄1000 grs. of gold the unit of value,\r\nthe coin representing this weight of metal ceasing to be a legal\r\ntender when deficient by about half a grain. The standard having\r\nthus been determined, it remained to enforce it. By this time Peel\r\nhad been chosen by the creditor class as their mouthpiece, and in\r\n1819 he introduced a bill to provide for cash payments. He found\r\nlittle resistance to his measure, and proposed 1823 as the time for\r\nthe return; as it happened, the date was anticipated, and notes were\r\nredeemed in gold from May 1, 1821. As far as the coinage was concerned,\r\nthis legislation completed the work, but the task of limiting discounts\r\nremained untouched, a task of even more importance, for, as long as\r\nthe Bank continued discounting bills, and thus emitting an unlimited\r\nquantity of notes whenever the rate of interest rose, debtors not only\r\nmight always be able to face their obligations, but the worth of money\r\ncould not be materially enhanced. This question was decided by the\r\nissue of the panic of 1825, brought on by the Resumption Act.\r\n\r\nAt the suspension of 1797, paper in small denominations had been\r\nauthorized to replace the coin which disappeared, but this act expired\r\ntwo years after the return to specie payments. Therefore, as time\r\nelapsed, the small issues began to be called in, and, according to\r\nMacleod, the country circulation, by 1823, had contracted about twelve\r\nper cent. The Bank of England also withdrew a large body of notes in\r\ndenominations less than five pounds, and, to fill the gap, hoarded some\r\ntwelve million sovereigns, a mass of gold about equal to the yield of\r\nthe mines for the preceding seven or eight years. This gold had to be\r\ntaken from the currency of Europe, and the sudden contraction caused a\r\nshock which vibrated throughout the West.\r\n\r\nIn France gold coinage almost ceased, and prices dropped heavily,\r\ndeclining twenty-four per cent between 1819 and 1822. Yet perhaps the\r\nmost vivid picture of the distress caused by this absorption of gold,\r\nis given in a passage written by Macleod, to prove that Peel’s act had\r\nnothing to do with the catastrophe:--\r\n\r\n   “There was one perfectly satisfactory argument to show that\r\n    the low prices of that year had nothing to do with the Act of\r\n    1819, namely, that prices of all sorts of agricultural produce\r\n    were equally depressed all over the continent of Europe from\r\n    the same cause. The fluctuations, indeed, on the continent were\r\n    much more violent than even in England.... The same phenomena\r\n    were observed in Italy. A similar fall, but not to so great an\r\n    extent, took place at Lisbon. What could the Act of 1819 have\r\n    to do with these places?”[351]\r\n\r\nThe severe and protracted depression, while affecting all producers,\r\nbore with peculiar severity upon the gentry, whose estates were\r\nburdened with mortgages and all kinds of settlements, so much so\r\nthat frequently properties sank below their encumbrances, and the\r\nowners were beggared. At the opening of Parliament, both Houses were\r\noverwhelmed with petitions for aid. Among these petitions, one of\r\nthe best known was presented to the Commons in May, 1822, by Charles\r\nAndrew Thompson, of Chiswick, which serves to show the keenness of the\r\ndistress among debtors owning land.\r\n\r\nThompson stated, in substance, that in 1811 he and his father, being\r\nwealthy merchants, purchased an estate in Hertfordshire for £62,000,\r\nand afterward laid out £10,000 more in improvements. That in 1812 they\r\nentered into a contract for another estate, whose price was £60,000,\r\nbut, a question having arisen as to the title, a lawsuit intervened,\r\nand, before judgment, the petitioner and his father had experienced\r\nsuch losses that they could not pay the sum adjudged due by the court.\r\nThereupon, to raise money, they mortgaged both estates for £65,000.\r\nIn July, 1821, both estates were offered for sale, but they failed\r\nto bring the amount for which they were mortgaged. Estates in other\r\ncounties which cost £33,166, had been sold for £12,000, and through the\r\ndepression of trade the petitioners had become bankrupt. In 1822 the\r\npetitioner’s father died of a broken heart; and he himself remained a\r\nruined man, with seven children of his own, ten of his brother’s, and\r\nseven of his sister’s all depending on him.[352]\r\n\r\nThe nation seemed upon the brink of some convulsion, for the gentry\r\nhardly cared to disguise their design of effecting a readjustment of\r\nboth public and private debts. Passions ran high, and in June, 1822,\r\na long debate followed upon a motion, made by Mr. Western, to inquire\r\ninto the effects produced by the resumption of cash payments. The\r\nmotion was indeed defeated, but defeated by a concession which entailed\r\na catastrophe up to that time unequalled in the experience of Great\r\nBritain. To save the “Resumption Act” the ministry in July brought in\r\na bill to respite the small notes until 1833, a measure which at once\r\nquieted the agitation, but which produced the most far-reaching and\r\nunexpected results.\r\n\r\nAccording to Francis, the country banks augmented their issues fifty\r\nper cent between 1822 and 1825,[353] nor was this increase of paper the\r\nonly or the most serious form taken by the inflation. The great hoard\r\nof sovereigns, accumulated by the Bank to replace its small notes, was\r\nmade superfluous; and, in a memorandum delivered by the directors to\r\nthe House of Commons, no less than £14,200,000 were stated to have been\r\nthrown on their hands in 1824 by this change of policy.[354] The effect\r\nwas to create a veritable glut of gold in the United Kingdom; prices\r\nrose abnormally--fifteen per cent--between 1824 and 1825.\r\n\r\nAs values tended upward, a frenzy of speculation seized upon a people\r\nwho had long suffered from the grinding of contraction, and meanwhile\r\nthe Bank, adhering to its old policy, freely discounted all the sound\r\nbills brought them. In 1824 prices rose above the Continental level,\r\nand gold, being cheaper in London than in Paris, began to flow thither.\r\nThe Bank reserve steadily fell. In March, 1825, the fever reached\r\nits height, and a decline set in, while the directors, anxious at the\r\ncondition of their reserve in May, attempted to restrict their issues.\r\nThe consequence was sharp contraction, and in November the crash came.\r\nMr. Huskisson stated, in the House of Commons, that for forty-eight\r\nhours it was impossible to convert even government securities into\r\ncash. Exchequer bills, bank stock, and East India stock were alike\r\nunsalable, and many of the richest merchants of London walked the\r\nstreets, not knowing whether on the morrow they might not be insolvent.\r\n“It is said” the Bank itself “must have stopped payment, and that we\r\nshould have been reduced to a state of barter, but for a box full of\r\nold one and two-pound notes which was discovered by accident.”[355]\r\nWhat happened in the Bank parlour during those days is unknown.\r\nProbably the pressure of the mercantile classes became too sharp to be\r\nwithstood, perhaps even the strongest bankers were alarmed; but, at\r\nall events, the financial policy changed completely. Contraction was\r\nabandoned, the Bank reverted to the system of 1810, and in an instant\r\nrelief came. “We lent by every possible means, and in modes we had\r\nnever adopted before; ... we not only discounted outright, but we made\r\nadvances on deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount.” The\r\nBank emitted five millions in notes in four days, and “this audacious\r\npolicy was crowned with the most complete success, the panic was stayed\r\nalmost immediately.”[356]\r\n\r\nWith an expansion of the currency sufficient to furnish the means of\r\npaying debts, the panic passed away, but the disaster gave the bankers\r\ntheir opportunity; they seized it, and thenceforward their hold upon\r\nthe community never, even for an instant, relaxed. The administration\r\nfell into discredit, and turned for assistance to the only men who\r\npromised to give them effective support: these were the capitalists of\r\nLombard Street, whose first care was to obtain a statute prohibiting\r\nthe small notes, which, they alleged, were the cause of the misfortune\r\nof 1825. The act they demanded passed in 1826, and about this time\r\nSamuel Loyd rose into prominence, who was, perhaps, the greatest\r\nfinancier of modern times. Cautious and sagacious, though resolute\r\nand bold, gifted with an amazing penetration into the complex causes\r\nwhich control the competition of modern life, he swayed successive\r\nadministrations, and crushed down the fiercest opposition. Apparently\r\nhe never faltered in his course, and down to the day of his death he\r\nsneered at the panic-stricken directors, who only saved themselves\r\nfrom bankruptcy by accidentally remembering and issuing a “parcel of\r\nold discarded one-pound notes ... drawn forth from a refuse cellar in\r\n1825.”[357]\r\n\r\nLoyd’s father began life somewhat humbly as a dissenting minister\r\nin Wales, but, after his marriage, he entered a Manchester firm,\r\nand subsequently founded in London the house of Jones, Loyd and Co.,\r\nafterward merged in the London and Westminster Bank, one of the largest\r\nconcerns in the world. Samuel did not actually succeed his father until\r\n1844, but much earlier he had grown to be the recognized chief of the\r\nmonied interest, and Sir Robert Peel long served as his lieutenant.\r\nLoyd was the man who conceived the Bank Act of 1844, who succeeded in\r\nlaying his grasp upon the currency of the kingdom, and in whose words,\r\ntherefore, the policy of the new governing class is best stated:--\r\n\r\n   “A paper-circulation is the substitution of paper ... in the\r\n    place of the precious metals. The amount of it ought therefore\r\n    to be equal to what would have been the amount of a metallic\r\n    circulation; and of this the best measure is the influx or\r\n    efflux of bullion.”[358]\r\n\r\n   “By the provisions of that Act [the Bank Act of 1844] it\r\n    is permitted to issue notes to the amount of £14,000,000 as\r\n    before--that is, with no security for the redemption of the\r\n    notes on demand beyond the legal obligation so to redeem them.\r\n    But all fluctuations in the amount of notes issued beyond\r\n    this £14,000,000 must have direct reference to corresponding\r\n    fluctuations in the amount of gold.”[359]\r\n\r\nThus Loyd’s principle, which he embodied in his statute, was the\r\nrigid limitation of the currency to the weight of gold available\r\nfor money. “When ... notes are permitted to be issued, the number in\r\ncirculation should always be exactly equal to the coin which would\r\nbe in circulation if they did not exist.”[360] In 1845 the Bank Act\r\nwas extended to Scotland, except that there small notes were still\r\ntolerated; the expansion of provincial paper was prohibited, and\r\nEngland reverted to the economic condition of Byzantium,--a condition\r\nof contraction in which the debtor class lies prostrate, for, the legal\r\ntender being absolutely limited, when creditors choose to withdraw\r\ntheir loans, payment becomes impossible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no financier has ever lived abler than Samuel Loyd. Certainly\r\nhe understood as few men, even of later generations, have understood,\r\nthe mighty engine of the single standard. He comprehended that, with\r\nexpanding trade, an inelastic currency must rise in value; he saw\r\nthat, with sufficient resources at command, his class might be able to\r\nestablish such a rise, almost at pleasure; certainly that they could\r\nmanipulate it when it came, by taking advantage of foreign exchanges.\r\nHe perceived moreover that, once established, a contraction of the\r\ncurrency might be forced to an extreme, and that when money rose beyond\r\nprice, as in 1825, debtors would have to surrender their property on\r\nsuch terms as creditors might dictate.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, he reasoned that under pressure prices must fall to a\r\npoint lower than in other nations, that then money would flow from\r\nabroad, and relief would ultimately be given, even if the government\r\ndid not interfere; that this influx of gold would increase the quantity\r\nof money, by so doing would again raise prices, and that, when prices\r\nrose, pledges forfeited in the panic might be resold at an advance. He\r\nexplained the principle of this rise and fall of values, with his usual\r\nlucidity, to a committee of the House of Lords, which investigated the\r\npanic of 1847:--\r\n\r\n“Monetary distress tends to produce fall of prices; that fall of prices\r\nencourages exports and diminishes imports; consequently it tends to\r\npromote an influx of bullion. I can quote a fact of rather a striking\r\ncharacter, which tends to show that a contracting operation upon the\r\ncirculation tends to cheapen the cost of our manufactured productions,\r\nand therefore to increase our exports.” He then stated that during\r\nthe panic he had received a letter “from a person of great importance\r\nin Lancashire,” begging him to use his influence with the ministry\r\n“to be firm in maintaining the act,--to be firm in resisting these\r\napplications for relaxation,” because in Lancashire the manufacturers\r\nwere struggling to “resist the improperly high price of the raw\r\nmaterial of cotton.” “That letter reached me the very morning that the\r\nletter of the government was issued [suspending the act], and almost\r\nimmediately the raw cotton rose in price.”\r\n\r\n    _Q._ “The writer of that letter was probably a man of\r\n    considerable substance, a very wealthy man, with abundant\r\n    capital to carry on his business?\r\n\r\n    _A._ “He had recently retired from business. I can state\r\n    another circumstance that occurred in London corroborative\r\n    of the same results. Within half an hour of the time that\r\n    the notes summoning the Court of Directors ... were issued,\r\n    parties, inferring probably ... that a relaxation was about to\r\n    take place, sent orders to withdraw goods from a sale which was\r\n    then going on.”[361]\r\n\r\nThe history of half a century has justified the diagnosis of this\r\neminent financier. As followed out by his successors, Loyd’s policy\r\nhas not only forced down prices throughout the West, but has changed\r\nthe aspect of civilization. In England the catastrophe began with the\r\npassage of the Bank Act.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had this statute taken effect than it necessarily caused a\r\ncontraction of the currency at a time when gold was rising because of\r\ncommercial expansion. Between 1839 and 1849 there was a fall in prices\r\nof twenty-eight per cent, and, severe as may have been the decline,\r\nit seems moderate considering the conditions which then prevailed.\r\nThe yield of the mines was scanty, and of this yield India absorbed\r\nannually an average of £2,308,000, or somewhat more than one-sixth.\r\n\r\nAmerica was growing with unprecedented vigour, industrial competition\r\nsharpened as prices fell, and the year of the “Bank Act” was the year\r\nin which railway building began to take the form of a mania.\r\n\r\nThe peasantry are always the weakest part of every population, and\r\ntherefore agricultural prices are the most sensitive. But the resources\r\nof a peasantry are seldom large, and, as the value of their crops\r\nshrinks, the margin of profit on which they live dwindles, until they\r\nare left with only a bare subsistence in good years, and with famine\r\nfacing them in bad. The Irish peasants were the weakest portion of the\r\npopulation of Great Britain when Lord Overstone became supreme, and\r\nwhen the potato crop failed in 1845 they starved.\r\n\r\nAlthough the landlords had lost their command over the nation in\r\n1688, they yet, down to the last administration of Peel, had kept\r\nstrength enough to secure protection from Parliament against foreign\r\ncompetition. By 1815 the yeomanry had almost disappeared, the soil\r\nbelonged to a few rich families whose revenue depended on rents, and\r\nthe value of rents turned on the price of the cereals. To sustain the\r\nmarket for wheat became therefore all-important to the aristocracy, and\r\nwhen, with the peace, prices collapsed, they obtained a statute which\r\nprohibited imports until the bushel should fetch ten shillings at home.\r\n\r\nThis statute, though frequently amended to make it more effective,\r\npartially failed of its purpose. A contracting currency did its\r\nresistless work, prices dropped, tenants went bankrupt, and, as the\r\nvalue of money rose, encumbered estates passed more frequently into\r\nthe hands of creditors. Thus when Peel took office in 1841, the Corn\r\nLaws were regarded by the gentry as their only hope, and Peel as their\r\nchosen champion; but only a few years elapsed before it became evident\r\nthat the policy of Lombard Street must precipitate a struggle for life\r\nbetween the manufacturers and the landlords. In the famine of 1846\r\nthe decisive moment came, and when Sir Robert sided, as was his wont,\r\nwith the strongest, and abandoned his followers to their fate, he only\r\nyielded to the impulsion of a resistless force.\r\n\r\nAs a class both landlords and manufacturers were debtors, and, by\r\n1844, cheap bread appeared to be as vital to the one as dear corn was\r\nto the other. With a steadily falling market the manufacturers saw\r\ntheir margin of profit shrink, and at last Manchester and Birmingham\r\nbelieved themselves to be confronted with ruin unless wages fell\r\nproportionately, or they could broaden the market for their wares by\r\nmeans of international exchanges. The Corn Laws closed both avenues of\r\nrelief; therefore there was war to the death between the manufacturers\r\nand the aristocracy. The savageness of the attack can be judged\r\nby Cobden’s jeers at gentlemen who admitted that free corn meant\r\ninsolvency:--\r\n\r\n   “Sir Edward Knatchbull could not have made a better speech for\r\n    the League than that which he made lately, even if he were paid\r\n    for it. I roared so with laughter that he called me specially\r\n    to order, and I begged his pardon, for he is the last man in\r\n    the world I would offend, we are all so much obliged to him.\r\n    He said they could not do without this Corn Law, because, if\r\n    it were repealed, they could not pay the jointures, charged on\r\n    their estates. Lord Mountcashel, too (he’s not over-sharp) said\r\n    that one half the land was mortgaged, and they could not pay\r\n    the interest unless they had a tax upon bread. In Lancashire,\r\n    when a man gets into debt and can’t pay, he goes into the\r\n    _Gazette_, and what is good for a manufacturer is, I think,\r\n    good for a landlord.”[362]\r\n\r\nIn such a contest the gentry were overmatched, for they were but\r\nnature’s first effort toward creating the economic type, and they\r\nwere pitted against later forms which had long distanced them in the\r\ncompetition of life. Bright and Cobden, as well as Loyd and Peel,\r\nbelonged to a race which had been driven into trade, by the loss\r\nof their freeholds to the fortunate ancestors of the men who lay at\r\ntheir mercy in 1846. Peel himself was the son of a cotton-spinner, and\r\nthe grandson of a yeoman, who, only in middle life, had quitted his\r\nhand-loom to make his fortune in the “industrial revolution.”\r\n\r\nIn modern England, as in ancient Italy, the weakest sank first, and the\r\nlanded gentry succumbed, almost without resistance, to the combination\r\nwhich Lombard Street made against them. Yet, though the manufacturers\r\nseemed to triumph, their exultation was short, for the fate impended\r\nover them, even in the hour of their victory, which always overhangs\r\nthe debtor when the currency has been seized by the creditor class.\r\nBy the “Bank Act” the usurers became supreme, and in 1846 the potato\r\ncrop failed even more completely than in 1845. Credit always is more\r\nsensitive in England than in France, because it rests upon a narrower\r\nbasis, and at that moment it happened to be strained by excessive\r\nrailway loans. With free trade in corn, large imports of wheat were\r\nmade, which were paid for with gold. A drain set in upon the Bank, the\r\nreserve was depleted, and by October 2, 1847, the directors denied all\r\nfurther advances. Within three years of the passage of his statute,\r\nthe event Loyd had foreseen arrived. “Monetary distress” began to force\r\ndown prices. The decision of the directors to refuse discounts created\r\n“a great excitement on the Stock Exchange. The town and country bankers\r\nhastened to sell their public securities, to convert them into money.\r\nThe difference between the price of consols for ready money and for the\r\naccount of the 14th of October showed a rate of interest equivalent to\r\n50 per cent per annum. Exchequer bills were sold at 35s. discount.”...\r\n“A complete cessation of private discounts followed. No one would part\r\nwith the money or notes in his possession. The most exorbitant sums\r\nwere offered to and refused by merchants for their acceptances.”[363]\r\n\r\nAdditional gold could only be looked for from abroad, and as a\r\nconsiderable time must elapse before specie could arrive in sufficient\r\nquantity to give relief, the currency actually in use offered the only\r\nmeans of obtaining legal tender for the payment of debts. Consequently\r\nhoarding became general, and, as the chancellor of the exchequer\r\nafterward observed, “an amount of circulation which, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, would have been adequate, became insufficient for the\r\nwants of the community.” Boxes of gold and bank-notes in “thousands\r\nand tens of thousands of pounds” were “deposited with bankers.” The\r\nmerchants, the chancellor said, begged for notes: “Let us have notes;\r\n... we don’t care what the rate of interest is.... Only tell us that we\r\ncan get them, and this will at once restore confidence.”[364]\r\n\r\nBut, after October 2, no notes were to be had, money was a commodity\r\nwithout price, and had the policy of the “Bank Act” been rigorously\r\nmaintained, English debtors, whose obligations then matured, must have\r\nforfeited their property, since credit had ceased to exist and currency\r\ncould not be obtained wherewith to redeem their pledges.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of the usurer has, however, never been to ruin suddenly\r\nthe community in which he has lived: only by degrees does he exhaust\r\nhuman vitality. Therefore, when the great capitalists had satisfied\r\ntheir appetites, they gave relief. From the 2d to the 25th of October,\r\ncontraction was allowed to do its work; then Overstone intervened, the\r\ngovernment was instructed to suspend the “act,” and the community was\r\npromised all the currency it might require.\r\n\r\nThe effect was instantaneous. The letter from the cabinet, signed\r\nby Lord John Russell, which recommended the directors of the Bank to\r\nincrease their discounts, “was made public about one o’clock on Monday,\r\nthe 25th, and no sooner was it done so than the panic vanished like a\r\ndream! Mr. Gurney stated that it produced its effect in ten minutes! No\r\nsooner was it known that notes _might_ be had, than the want of them\r\nceased!”[365] Large parcels of notes were “returned to the Bank of\r\nEngland cut into halves, as they had been sent down into the country.”\r\n\r\nThe story of this crisis demonstrates that, by 1844, the money-lenders\r\nhad become autocratic in London. The ministry were naturally unwilling\r\nto suspend a statute which had just been enacted, and the blow to Sir\r\nRobert Peel was peculiarly severe; but the position of the government\r\nadmitted of no alternative. At the time it was said that the private\r\nbankers of London intimated to the chancellor of the exchequer that,\r\nunless he interfered forthwith, they would withdraw their balances from\r\nthe Bank of England. This meant insolvency, and to such an argument\r\nthere was no reply. But whether matters actually went so far or not,\r\nthere can be no question that the cabinet acted under the dictation\r\nof Lombard Street, for the chancellor of the exchequer defended his\r\npolicy by declaring that the “act” had not been suspended until “those\r\nconversant with commercial affairs, and least likely to decide in\r\nfavour of the course which we ultimately adopted,” unanimously advised\r\nthat relief should be given to the mercantile community.[366]\r\n\r\nThere was extreme suffering throughout the country, which manifested\r\nitself in all the well-known ways. The revenue fell off, emigration\r\nincreased, wheat brought but about five shillings the bushel, while\r\nin England and Wales alone there were upwards of nine hundred thousand\r\npaupers. Discontent took the form of Chartism, and a revolution seemed\r\nimminent. Nor was it Great Britain only which was convulsed: all\r\nEurope was shaken to its centre, and everything portended some dire\r\nconvulsion, when nature intervened and poured upon the world a stream\r\nof treasure too bountiful to be at once controlled.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the first Californian gold reached Liverpool. In four years the\r\nsupply of the precious metals trebled, prices rose, crops sold again\r\nat a profit. As the farmers grew rich, the demand for manufactures\r\nquickened, wages advanced, discontent vanished, and though values\r\nnever again reached the altitude of 1809, they at least attained that\r\nlevel of substantial prosperity which preceded the French Revolution.\r\nNevertheless, the fall in the purchasing power of money, and the\r\nconsequent ability of debtors to meet their obligations, did not\r\nexcite that universal joy which had thrilled Europe at the discovery\r\nof Potosi, for a profound change had passed over society since the\r\nbuccaneers laid the foundations of England’s fortune by the plunder of\r\nthe Peruvian galleons.\r\n\r\nTo the type of mind which predominated after 1810, the permanent rise\r\nof commodities relatively to money was unwelcome, and, almost from\r\nthe opening of the gold discoveries, a subtle but resistless force\r\nwas working for contraction--a force which first showed itself in the\r\nmovement for an uniform gold coinage, and afterwards in general gold\r\nmonometallism. The great change came with the conquest of France by\r\nGermany. Until after the middle of the nineteenth century, Germany held\r\nonly a secondary position in the economic system of Europe, because of\r\nher poverty. With few harbours, she had reaped little advantage from\r\nthe plunder of America and India, exchanges had never centred within\r\nher borders, and her accumulated capital had not sufficed to stimulate\r\nhigh consolidation. The conquest of France suddenly transformed these\r\nconditions. In 1871 she acquired an enormous booty, and the effect upon\r\nher was akin to the effect on England of the confiscations in Bengal;\r\nthe chief difference being that, unlike England, Germany passed almost\r\nimmediately into the period of contraction.\r\n\r\nThe spoliation of India went on for twenty years, that of France\r\nwas finished in a few months, and, while in England the “industrial\r\nrevolution” intervened between Plassey and the adoption of the\r\ngold standard, in Germany the bankers dominated from the outset.\r\nThe government belonged to the class which desired an appreciating\r\ncurrency, and in 1873 the new empire followed in the steps of Lombard\r\nStreet, and demonetized silver.\r\n\r\nGermany’s action was decisive. Restrictions were placed on the mints\r\nof the Latin Union and of the United States, and thus, by degrees,\r\nthe whole stress of the trade of the West was transferred from the old\r\ncomposite currency to gold alone. In this way, not only was the basis\r\nof credit in the chief commercial states cut in half, but the annual\r\nsupply of metal for coinage was diminished. In 1893 the gold mined fell\r\nnearly nine per cent short of the value of the gold and silver produced\r\nin 1865, and yet, during those twenty-eight years, the demand for money\r\nmust have increased enormously, if it in any degree corresponded with\r\nthe growth of trade.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which followed the adoption of the gold standard by\r\nWestern countries were precisely those which had been anticipated by\r\nLoyd. Lord Overstone had explained them to an earlier generation.\r\nIn one of his letters on the “Bank Charter,” as early as 1855, he\r\ndeveloped the whole policy of the usurers:--\r\n\r\n   “If a country increases in population, in wealth, in\r\n    enterprise, and activity, more circulating medium will probably\r\n    be required to conduct its extended transactions. This demand\r\n    for increased circulation will raise the value of the existing\r\n    circulation; it will become more scarce and more valuable, ...\r\n    in other words--gold will rise....”[367]\r\n\r\nBy the action of Germany, Overstone’s policy was extended to the whole\r\nWestern world, with the results he had foreseen. Gold appreciated,\r\nuntil it acquired a purchasing power unequalled since the Middle Ages,\r\nand while in the silver-using countries prices remained substantially\r\nunchanged and the producers accordingly prospered, prostration\r\nsupervened in Europe, the United States, and Australia. As usual the\r\nrural population suffered most, and the English aristocracy, who had\r\nbeen respited by the gold discoveries, were the first to succumb. They\r\nnot only drew their revenues from farming land, but, standing at the\r\nfocus of competition, they were exposed to the pressure of Asia and\r\nAmerica alike. The harvest of 1879 was one of the worst of the century,\r\nland depreciated hopelessly, and that year may probably be taken as\r\nmarking the downfall of a class which had maintained itself in opulence\r\nfor nearly three hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nThis Tudor aristocracy, which sprang up at the Reformation, was one\r\nof the first effects of the quickened movement which transferred the\r\ncentre of exchanges from Italy to the North Sea. They represented\r\nsharpening economic competition, and they prospered because of an\r\nintellectual gift, an aptitude they enjoyed, of absorbing the lands\r\nof the priests and soldiers amidst whom they dwelt. These soldiers\r\nwere the yeomen who, when evicted, became pirates, slavers, commercial\r\nadventurers, religious colonists, and conquerors, and who together\r\npoured the flood of treasure into London which, transmuted into\r\nmovement, made the “industrial revolution.” When by their efforts,\r\ntoward the beginning of the nineteenth century, sufficiently vast\r\nreservoirs of energy in the shape of money had accumulated, a new race\r\nrose to prominence, fitted to give vent to this force--men like Nathan\r\nRothschild and Samuel Loyd, probably endowed with a subtler intellect\r\nand a keener vision than any who had preceded them, financiers beside\r\nwhom the usurers of Byzantium, or the nobles of Henry VIII., were\r\npigmies.\r\n\r\nThese bankers conceived a policy unrivalled in brilliancy, which made\r\nthem masters of all commerce, industry, and trade. They engrossed the\r\ngold of the world, and then, by legislation, made it the sole measure\r\nof values. What Samuel Loyd and his followers did to England, in 1847,\r\nbecame possible for his successors to do to all the gold standard\r\nnations, after 1873. When the mints had been closed to silver, the\r\ncurrency being inelastic, the value of money could be manipulated like\r\nthat of any article limited in quantity, and thus the human race became\r\nthe subjects of the new aristocracy, which represented the stored\r\nenergy of mankind.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment this aristocracy has determined on a policy, as,\r\nfor example the “Bank Act” or monometallism, resistance by producers\r\nbecomes most difficult. Being debtors, producers are destroyed when\r\ncredit is withdrawn, and, at the first signs of insubordination, the\r\nbankers draw in their gold, contract their loans, and precipitate a\r\npanic. Then, to escape immediate ruin, the debtor yields.\r\n\r\nSince 1873 prices have generally fallen, and the mortgage has tended to\r\nengulf the pledge; but, from time to time the creditor class feels the\r\nneed of turning the property it has acquired from bankrupts into gold,\r\nand then the rise explained by Overstone takes place. The hoards are\r\nopened, credit is freely given, the quantity of currency is increased,\r\nvalues rise, sales are made, and new adventurers contract fresh\r\nobligations. Then this expansion is followed by a fresh contraction,\r\nand liquidation is repeated on an ever-descending scale.\r\n\r\nFor many years farming land has fallen throughout the West, as it\r\nfell in Italy in the time of Pliny. Everywhere, as under Trajan, the\r\npeasantry are distressed; everywhere they migrate to the cities, as\r\nthey did when Rome repudiated the denarius. By the census of the United\r\nKingdom taken in 1891, not only did it appear that over seventy-one per\r\ncent of the inhabitants of England and Wales lived in towns, but that,\r\nwhile the urban districts had increased above fifteen per cent since\r\nthe last census, the population of the purely agricultural counties had\r\ndiminished.[368]\r\n\r\nMoreover, within a generation, there has been a marked loss of\r\nfecundity among the more costly races. The rate of increase of the\r\npopulation has diminished. In the United States it is generally\r\nbelieved that the old native American blood is hardly reproducing\r\nitself; but, in all social phenomena, France precedes other nations\r\nby at least a quarter of a century, and it is, therefore, in France\r\nthat the failure of vitality is most plainly seen. In 1789 the\r\naverage French family consisted of 4.2 children. In 1891 it had\r\nfallen to 2.1,[369] and, since 1890, the deaths seem to have equalled\r\nthe births.[370] In 1889 legislation was attempted to encourage\r\nproductiveness, and parents of seven children were exempted from\r\ncertain classes of taxes, but the experiment failed. Levasseur, in his\r\ngreat work on the population of France, has expressed himself almost\r\nin the words of Tacitus: “It can be laid down as a general law that,\r\nif in such a social condition as that of the French of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the number of children is small, it is because the majority of\r\nparents wish it should be small.”[371]\r\n\r\nSuch signs point to the climax of consolidation. And yet, even the\r\nrise of the bankers is not the only or the surest indication that\r\ncentralization is culminating. The destruction, wrought by accelerated\r\nmovement, of the less tenacious organisms, is more evident below than\r\nabove, is more striking in the advance of cheap labour, than in the\r\nevolution of the financier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently nature needs to consume about three generations in\r\nperfecting the selection of a new type. Accordingly the money-lenders\r\ndid not become absolute immediately after Waterloo, and a period\r\nof some sixty years followed during which the adventurers kept up a\r\nstruggle, wherein they were aided by the discoveries of gold near the\r\nmiddle of the century. Seemingly they met their final defeat at Sedan,\r\nfor the decay of the soldier, which had been in progress since the fall\r\nof Napoleon, reached a point, after the collapse of the Second Empire,\r\neven lower than after the consolidation of Rome.\r\n\r\nFrom Alaric to Napoleon the soldier had served as an independent vent\r\nto energy. Often, even when opposed to capital, he had been victorious,\r\nand the highest function of a leader of men had been, in theory at\r\nleast, military command. The ideal statesman had been one who, like\r\nCromwell, Frederic the Great, Henry IV., William III., and Washington,\r\ncould lead his followers in battle, and, on the Continent, down to\r\n1789, the aristocracy had professedly been a military caste. In France\r\nand Germany the old tradition lasted to within a generation. Only\r\nafter 1871 came the new era, an era marked by many social changes. For\r\nthe first time in their history the ruler of the French people passed\r\nadmittedly from the martial to the monied type, and everywhere the same\r\nphenomenon appeared; the whole administration of society fell into the\r\nhands of the economic man. Nothing so radical happened at Rome, or even\r\nat Byzantium, for there the pressure of the barbarians necessitated\r\nthe retention of the commander at the head of the State; in Europe\r\nhe lost this importance. Since the capitulation of Paris the soldier\r\nhas tended to sink more and more into a paid official, receiving his\r\norders from financiers with his salary, without being allowed a voice\r\neven in questions involving peace and war. The same fate has overtaken\r\nthe producing classes; they have failed to maintain themselves, and\r\nhave become subjects of the possessors of hoarded wealth. Although\r\nthe conventions of popular government are still preserved, capital is\r\nat least as absolute as under the Cæsars, and, among capitalists, the\r\nmoney-lenders form an aristocracy. Debtors are in reality powerless,\r\nbecause of the extension of that very system of credit which they\r\ninvented to satisfy their needs. Although the volume of credit is\r\ngigantic, the basis on which it rests is so narrow that it may be\r\nmanipulated by a handful of men. That basis is gold; in gold debts must\r\nbe paid; therefore, when gold is withdrawn, the debtor is helpless\r\nand becomes the servant of his master. The elasticity of the age of\r\nexpansion has gone.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy which wields this autocratic power is beyond attack,\r\nfor it is defended by a wage-earning police, by the side of which the\r\nlegions were a toy; a police so formidable that, for the first time\r\nin history, revolt is hopeless and is not attempted. The only question\r\nwhich preoccupies the ruling class is whether it is cheaper to coerce\r\nor to bribe.\r\n\r\nOn looking back over long periods of time, the sequence of causes may\r\nbe followed which have led to this result. First, inventions from the\r\nEast facilitated trade; then, the perfection of weapons of attack made\r\npolice possible, and individual bravery unnecessary; on this followed\r\nthe abasement of the martial and exaltation of the economic type; and\r\nfinally that intense acceleration of movement by machinery supervened,\r\nwhich, in annihilating space, has destroyed the protection that the\r\ncostly races long enjoyed against the competition of simpler organisms.\r\n\r\nRoman civilization was less complex than modern because of the relative\r\ninflexibility of the Latin mind. Unable to quicken his motions by\r\ninventions, the ancient Italian failed to discover America or absorb\r\nIndia, and, for the same reason, collapsed without an effort under the\r\ninsidious attack of Asiatic and African labour. No industrial expansion\r\nfollowed the influx of bullion under Cæsar, and therefore, when the\r\nvalue of cereals fell, the evicted farmer either sank into slavery or\r\nbegged for bread from the magnates of the Senate. In modern times an\r\nindustrial period has intervened; the evicted long found employment\r\nin the factories of the towns, and it has only been as contraction\r\nhas reduced the demand for merchandise, by diminishing the purchasing\r\npower of the agricultural population, that those stagnant pools of the\r\nunemployed have collected, which exactly correspond to the proletariat.\r\nBut, as each special faculty which, for a time, enables its possessor\r\nto excel in competition, seems to bear with it the seeds of its own\r\ndecay, so the inventive, which once enabled the Western races to\r\nundersell the Eastern in their homes seems destined to reduce all to a\r\ncommon economic level, as Rome sank to the level of Egypt.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a century the inventions of Hargreaves, of Crompton, of\r\nCartwright, and of Watt, enabled Lancashire to supply Bombay and\r\nCalcutta with fabrics, as, in the seventeenth century, Surat and\r\nCalicut had supplied London, and this superiority appeared assured\r\nuntil Orientals should acquire the momentum necessary for machinery.\r\nOne effect in Europe was the rapid increase of a population congregated\r\nin towns, and bearing a marked resemblance to the “humiliores” of\r\nRome in their disinclination for war. True to their instincts, the\r\nadventurers ever quickened their movements, ever extended the sphere\r\nof their enterprises, and, finally, just as the Second Empire verged\r\nupon its fall, they opened the Suez Canal in 1869. The consequences\r\nof this great engineering triumph have probably equalled in gravity\r\nthe establishment of the gold standard, but the two phenomena had this\r\nmarked difference. The producers saw their danger and resisted to the\r\nutmost the contraction of the currency, whereas the Canal was a case\r\nof suicide. Thenceforward grain, raised by the most enduring labour of\r\nthe world, could be thrown without limit on the European market, and,\r\nagricultural competition once established, industrial could only be a\r\nquestion of time. The Canal made the importation and the reparation of\r\nmachinery cheap throughout Asia.\r\n\r\nFrom a period, perhaps, as remote as Clive’s victories, the Hindoos\r\nhad experienced a certain impulsion from contact with the British,\r\nbut it was not until the building of railroads, under Lord Dalhousie,\r\nthat the severer phases of competition opened among the inhabitants\r\nof India. Lord Dalhousie became Governor General in 1848, and, that\r\nthe acceleration of the next nine years culminated in a catastrophe\r\nseems certain, for nothing can be plainer than that the Mutiny of 1857\r\nwas an outbreak of a martial Mohammedan population crushed under an\r\nintolerable pressure.\r\n\r\nThe locality of the disturbance alone is enough to demonstrate the\r\naccuracy of this inference. Dalhousie’s last act was the annexation\r\nof the Kingdom of Oude. Of this province Lucknow is the capital, and\r\nwhile Lucknow was one focus of the insurrection, Delhi, the capital\r\nof the ancient Mogul empire, was the other. Once subdued by the\r\nBritish, and reduced to an economic equality with subtler races, the\r\nold Moslem gentry rapidly disappeared. Since 1857 these families,\r\nwhich had maintained themselves for six or seven hundred years, have\r\nrapidly fallen into ruin, and their estates have been bought by their\r\ncreditors, the rising usurer class.\r\n\r\nUnder immemorial native custom the money-lender, generally speaking,\r\nhad no forcible means of collecting debt; he relied on public opinion\r\nand conducted himself accordingly. On the other hand, unrestricted\r\nalienation of land was not usually incidental to proprietorship,\r\nand thus the tenant for life, as he would be called in English law,\r\ncould only pledge his crops; he could not sell the succession. With\r\ncentralization came full ownership, and with it summary process for\r\ndebt. Following her immutable law, nature, having changed the form\r\nof competition, proceeded to select a quality of mind to correspond\r\nwith the new conditions of life. She demanded improved vents for her\r\nenergy. Forthwith, under the pressure of accelerated movement and\r\nadvancing consolidation, the trammels of caste relaxed, the population\r\nfused, and a new aristocracy arose, composed of the strongest economic\r\ntypes culled from all the peoples who inhabit the plains south of\r\nthe Himalayas. This aristocracy is a strange mixture of blood, an\r\namalgam of the most diverse elements, of Parsees, Brahmins, Bunniahs\r\nof different races, with gifted individuals from other castes, like\r\nthe leather-workers or the goldsmiths; but among them all the most\r\nruthless, the corruptest, the most hated, and the most successful, are\r\nthe Marwaris, who have been thus described by a British commission:--\r\n\r\n   “The average Marwari money-lender is not a pleasant character\r\n    to analyze; his most prominent characteristics are love of gain\r\n    and indifference to the opinions or feelings of his neighbour.\r\n    He has considerable self-reliance and immense industry, but the\r\n    nature of his business and the method by which it is pursued\r\n    would tend to degrade and harden even a humane nature, which\r\n    his is not. As a landlord he follows the instincts of the\r\n    usurer, making the hardest terms possible with his tenant,\r\n    who is also his debtor and often little better than his\r\n    slave.”[372]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the selection of such a type as a dominant class must be\r\ndestructive to a martial population, whether it be French or English,\r\nMohammedan or Hindoo. The social revolution which swept over Oude after\r\nits annexation has been referred to, but the fate which overtook the\r\nfamous Mahratta nation is even more tragic and impressive.\r\n\r\nWhen, toward the close of the last century, the British were pushing\r\ntheir conquests inland, the most formidable enemy they met were the\r\nMahrattas; and, perhaps, the most renowned battle, next to Plassey,\r\never fought by Europeans against natives, was Assaye, where Wellesley\r\ndefeated Sindhia in 1803. These Mahrattas were tribes of Hindoo\r\nfarmers, who inhabited the mountainous country about one hundred miles\r\nto the east of Bombay; a territory of which Poona has always been\r\nconsidered the capital. Mounted on their hill ponies, these bold and\r\nhardy spearmen were always ready to follow their chiefs to battle,\r\nand, in the eighteenth century, became the terror not only of the\r\nMohammedans of the Deccan, but of the Mogul himself, at Delhi. Even\r\nthe English respected and feared them, and only subdued them in 1818\r\nafter desperate fighting. Then they were disarmed and subjected to the\r\ncombined action of peace and English law.\r\n\r\nSoon after this conquest an inflow of Marwaris began. As early as 1854,\r\nin Dalhousie’s administration, Captain Anderson stated that “two-thirds\r\nof the ryots [were] in the hands of the Marwaris, and that the average\r\ndebt of each individual [was] not less than Rs. 100.”[373] Competition\r\ncontinued unchecked as time flowed on, and in 1875 disturbances\r\nbroke out in certain villages near Poona, serious enough to cause the\r\ngovernment to appoint a commission of inquiry. After full investigation\r\nthis commission reported that up to 1872 or 1873 the peasantry had\r\nseemed relatively prosperous, but that afterward “prices fell quickly,”\r\nand that this fall had been accompanied by a rise in taxation of\r\nsomewhat more than fifty per cent.[374] Under this double pressure the\r\npeasantry had rapidly sunk into insolvency, and the whole real estate\r\nof the Deccan was passing into the hands of usurers, while the farmers\r\nhad become serfs toiling on the soil they had once owned, to satisfy an\r\ninextinguishable debt. Precisely like the _colonus_, the delinquent was\r\nnot evicted, but remained, “recorded as occupier of his holding, and\r\nresponsible for the payment of revenue assessed on it, but virtually\r\nreduced by pressure of debt to a tenant-at-will, ... sweated by his\r\nMarwari creditor. It is in that creditor’s power to eject him any day;\r\n... and if allowed to hold on, it is only on condition of paying over\r\nto his creditor all the produce of his land not absolutely necessary\r\nfor next year’s seed grain or for the support of life. He is indebted\r\non an average to the extent of sixteen or seventeen years’ payment of\r\nthe government revenue. He has nothing to hope for, but lives in daily\r\nfear of the final catastrophe.”[375]\r\n\r\nSince Assaye three generations have passed away, and the Mahratta\r\nspearmen have vanished. The Western Ghats are now tilled by a sluggish\r\nrace whom the British officers deem unworthy of their cavalry, and in\r\nthe place of those renowned and daring chiefs Sivaji and Holkar, stands\r\nthe Marwari under whom no ryots can prosper save those “who having\r\nreceived some education are able to combat the sowkars with their own\r\nweapons, fraud, chicanery, and even forgery.”[376] Apparently the same\r\ndestiny awaits every people which requires more than the minimum of\r\nnutriment, or which is not gifted with the economic mind,[377] for the\r\n“money-lenders sweep off the crops as soon as harvested, only leaving\r\nwith the ryots barely sufficient to eke out a subsistence till the\r\nfollowing year.”[378] That allowance, in the Deccan, is estimated at\r\nabout a dollar a month in silver--too little to sustain any but the\r\nmost tenacious organisms, even among Asiatics. Consequently, though the\r\npopulation of India is increasing rapidly, the increase lies chiefly\r\namong the aboriginal tribes who form the lowest castes, or in other\r\nwords among the non-martial or servile races. Men who, though enslaved\r\nby the Aryan invaders of prehistoric times, and who have always been\r\nsubjected to extremest hardship, have been gifted, like the Egyptian\r\nfellah, with an endurance which has enabled them to survive.[379]\r\n\r\nHerein, likewise, may be plainly perceived the destructive effects\r\nof the policy of the Western usurers upon the population subject\r\nto them. By enhancing the value of their own money they have nearly\r\ndoubled the intensity of this Asiatic competition. In India, silver has\r\nsubstantially retained its purchasing power, therefore the ryot now, as\r\nin the days of Captain Cunningham, can exist on two rupees a month, but\r\nhe cannot live on less. Accordingly, the severity of his competition\r\nwith Europeans must be measured by the value of his wages when reckoned\r\non the European scale. In 1854 the ryot’s two rupees were worth one\r\ndollar; now, through the appreciation of gold, they are worth about\r\nsixty cents, and the effect is the same as though the tenacity of life\r\nof the Asiatic had been increased four-sixths. Everything the Indian or\r\nChinese peasant produces with his hands, whether on the farm or in the\r\nfactory, has been reduced in price, in relation to Western peoples, in\r\nthe ratio of six to ten.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest form of labour is thus being bred on a gigantic scale,\r\nand this labour is being accelerated by an industrial development\r\nwhich is stimulated by eviction of the farmers, as the “industrial\r\nrevolution” was stimulated in England one hundred and thirty years ago.\r\nFor many years the cotton mills of Bombay have undersold Lancashire\r\nin the coarser fabrics, and when, by means of a canal to the Pacific,\r\nAmerican cotton can be imported cheaply, they will spin the finer\r\nalso. Moreover, Hindostan is full of iron and coal which has never\r\nbeen utilized because of the immense difference in the rapidity of\r\nEuropean and Asiatic labour, but the steadily falling range of Western\r\nprices must force the cheapest product on the market, and when the\r\nIndian railways have been assumed by the government, a new era will\r\nhave opened. The same causes are affecting China and Japan, and, under\r\nprecisely similar conditions, the centre of exchanges passed from the\r\nTiber to the Bosphorus sixteen hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nSuch uniformity of development in the most distant times, and among the\r\nmost divergent peoples, points to a progressive law of civilization,\r\neach stage of progress being marked by certain intellectual, moral,\r\nand physical changes. As the attack in war masters the defence, and the\r\ncombative instinct becomes unnecessary to the preservation of life, the\r\neconomic supersedes the martial mind, being superior in bread-winning.\r\nAs velocity augments and competition intensifies, nature begins to\r\nsift the economic minds themselves, culling a favoured aristocracy\r\nof the craftiest and the subtlest types; choosing, for example, the\r\nArmenian in Byzantium, the Marwari in India, and the Jew in London.\r\nConversely, as the costly nervous system of the soldier becomes an\r\nencumbrance, organisms, which can exist on less, successively supplant\r\neach other, until the limit of endurance is reached. Thus the Slavs\r\nexterminated the Greeks in Thrace and Macedonia, the Mahrattas and the\r\nMoslems dwindle before the low caste tribes of India, and the instinct\r\nof self-preservation has taught white races to resist an influx of\r\nChinese. When nature has finished this double task, civilization has\r\nreached its zenith. Humanity can ascend no higher.\r\n\r\nIn view of this possible extermination of the martial blood in the\r\nhigher stages of civilization, the attention necessarily becomes\r\nconcentrated on what is, perhaps, the main point of divergence between\r\nancient and modern society,--the presence and the absence of a supply\r\nof barbaric life. All the evidence points to the conclusion that the\r\ninfusion of vitality which Rome ever drew from territories beyond\r\nher borders, was the cause both of her strength and of her longevity.\r\nWithout such aid she could never have consolidated the world. On the\r\nother hand, the lack of this resource has been the weakness of modern\r\nnations. One after another they have dreamed of universal conquest, and\r\none after another they have fallen through exhaustion in war.\r\n\r\nSpain levied never a pikeman in America, and her colonies were a source\r\nof debility in so far as they drained her of her youth. Had Rome been\r\nsimilarly situated, she could hardly have carried the eagles beyond the\r\nBosphorus and the Alps. Perhaps Cæsar’s army was the best an ancient\r\ngeneral ever put in the field, and yet it was filled with barbarians.\r\nAll his legions were raised north of the Po, and most of them,\r\nincluding the tenth, north of the Alps.[380] When pitted against this\r\nforce native Italians broke in rout, and one of the most striking pages\r\nof Plutarch is the story of the gradual awakening of Pompey to a sense\r\nof the impotence of Romans. Pompey himself was a commander of high\r\nability, and, until he split upon the rock of the pure martial blood,\r\nbattle had been with him synonymous with victory.\r\n\r\nAt first he felt such confidence, he laughed at the suggestion of an\r\nattack within the Rubicon. With the conviction of the conqueror he\r\nsaid: “Whenever I stamp with my foot in any part of Italy, there will\r\nrise up forces enough in an instant, both horse and foot.”[381] A very\r\nshort experience of the men of the north sufficed to sober him; for,\r\nthough Cæsar’s command amounted to only twenty-two thousand, and his\r\nto twice as many, he not only declined an action, but took what care\r\nhe could to keep the threats of the Gauls from his men, “who were out\r\nof heart and despondent, through terror at the fierceness and hardiness\r\nof their enemies, whom they looked upon as a sort of wild beasts.”[382]\r\nPharsalia stunned him. When the tenth legion routed his left wing, he\r\nwent to his tent and sat speechless until the invasion of the camp;\r\nthen he walked away “softly afoot, taken up altogether with thoughts\r\nsuch as probably might possess a man that for the space of thirty-four\r\nyears together had been accustomed to conquest and victory, and was\r\nthen at last, in his old age, learning for the first time what defeat\r\nand flight were.”[383]\r\n\r\nThus, in reality, barbarians consolidated the ancient world, and\r\nthe force which created the Empire, afterward upheld it. With each\r\nsucceeding century the drafts of centralized society upon the blood of\r\nthe country beyond the Danube and the Rhine increased, but the supply\r\nproved limitless; and, when the Western provinces disintegrated, a new\r\nimaginative race poured over Italy and France, creating a new religion,\r\na new art, a new literature, and new institutions. Among modern nations\r\nthe Russians alone have developed this power of absorbing kindred\r\nconquered peoples; and yet, obviously, Napoleon would have fought his\r\ncampaigns under very different circumstances, and, perhaps, brought\r\nthem to a different end, had he, like Cæsar, had an exhaustless supply\r\nof the best soldiers, altogether independent of the population of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nReligious phenomena become explicable when viewed from the same\r\nstandpoint. Unquestionably scepticism has been to the full as rife\r\nin Paris since 1789 as it ever was in Rome, and yet no new religion\r\nhas been born. Supposing, however, that a vast and highly emotional\r\nemigration flowed annually into France, the aspect of life would be\r\ncompletely changed. Christian saints and martyrs were not begotten by\r\nthe usurers of Constantinople or of Rome, but by barbarian soldiers\r\nand Asiatic serfs, and Christianity could hardly have become a State\r\nreligion had the composition of society, as it existed under Trajan,\r\nremained unaltered. Even in the reign of Justinian the aristocracy\r\ncarped at faith, and Byzantine architecture did not bloom until the\r\ninvasions of Alaric and Attila.\r\n\r\nIf, then, although nature never precisely repeats herself, she operates\r\nupon the human mind according to immutable laws, it should be possible\r\nby comparing a living civilization with a dead, to estimate in some\r\ndegree the course which has been run. For such an attempt an infinite\r\nvariety of standards might be suggested, but few, perhaps, are more\r\nsuitable than the domestic relations which lie at the basis of the\r\nreproduction of life.\r\n\r\nIn a martial and imaginative age, where energy vents itself through\r\nfear, and every man must be a soldier, the family generally forms a\r\nunit; the women and children being under the control of the father,\r\nas they were under the control of the patriarchs in the Bible, or\r\nof the paterfamilias in Rome. In such periods the woman is sought\r\nafter by the man, and even commands a high money value; “And Shechem\r\nsaid unto her father, ... Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I\r\nwill give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel\r\nto wife.”[384] The Homeric heroes bought their wives, and, moreover,\r\nwere very fond of them--an affection the women returned, for in all\r\nclassical literature there are few more charming legends than that\r\nof Penelope. Divorce was unknown to Hector and Agamemnon, Ulysses\r\nand Achilles. Marriage, in these simple ages, is usually a rite\r\nhalf sacred, half warlike. When Abraham’s servant found Rebekah at\r\nthe well, he bowed his head, and blessed the Lord God of his master\r\nAbraham, which had led him in the right way. A Roman wedding was a\r\nsolemn religious function accompanied by prayer and sacrifice, and, at\r\nthe end, the bride was carried to her husband’s house, where she was\r\nviolently torn from her mother’s arms.\r\n\r\nAristotle, with his unerring acumen, made this observation: “That all\r\nwarlike races are prone to the love of women,” and also that they tend\r\nto “fall under the dominion of their wives.”[385] Undoubtedly this is\r\nthe instinct of the soldier, and, in martial ages, women are idealized.\r\nWhen a foreigner asked the wife of Leonidas, “Why do you Lacedæmonian\r\nwives, unlike all others, govern your husbands?” the Spartan answered,\r\n“Because we alone are the mothers of men.” When at Rome Tiberius killed\r\nthe male serpent, thereby devoting himself to death to save Cornelia,\r\nPlutarch, telling the story, remarked, “that Tiberius seemed to all men\r\nto have done nothing unreasonable, in choosing to die for such a woman;\r\nwho, when King Ptolemy himself proffered her his crown, and would have\r\nmarried her, refused it, and chose rather to live a widow.”[386]\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, that greatest of martial and imaginative epochs,\r\nmarriage developed into the most solemn of sacraments, and the worship\r\nof women became the popular religion. In France, especially, the\r\ncentre of thought, enthusiasm, and war, from the mighty fane of Paris\r\ndownward, the churches were dedicated to Mary, and the vow of chivalry\r\nbound the knight to fight for God and for his lady.\r\n\r\n   “It hath bene through all ages ever seene\r\n    That with the praise of armes and chevalrie\r\n    The prize of beautie still hath ioyned beene.”[387]\r\n\r\nIt might almost be said that the destinies of France have been moulded\r\nby men’s love for women, and that this influence still prevailed down\r\nto the advent of the usurers after the rout of Waterloo. On the other\r\nhand, nature bred a type of woman fit to mate with the imaginative\r\nman. The devotion of Saint Clara to Saint Francis is one of the most\r\nexquisite lyrics of the Church, and for six hundred years Héloïse\r\nremained an ideal of the West. Perhaps, indeed, that strange blending\r\nof tenderness and enthusiasm, which was peculiar to the mediæval mind,\r\nnever found more refined and exalted expression than in the simple\r\nhymn which Héloïse is said to have composed and sung at the grave of\r\nAbélard:--\r\n\r\n   “Tecum fata sum perpessa;\r\n    Tecum dormiam defessa,\r\n    Et in Sion veniam.\r\n    Solve crucem,\r\n    Due ad lucem\r\n    Degravatam animam.”\r\n\r\nIn primitive ages children are not only a source of power, but of\r\nwealth, and therefore the highest merit of the woman is fecundity.\r\n“And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, ... be thou the mother\r\nof thousands of millions.” Also maternity is then a glory, and\r\nchildlessness a shame; and Rachel said, “Give me children, or else\r\nI die.” “And she conceived and bare a son; and said, God hath taken\r\naway my reproach.” That she might live for her boys, Cornelia refused\r\na crown; and when they grew up, she would upbraid them because “the\r\nRomans as yet rather called her the daughter of Scipio than the mother\r\nof the Gracchi.” But Cornelia’s father was the conqueror of Hannibal,\r\nand her son was an agrarian agitator, whom the monied oligarchy\r\nmurdered for reviving the Licinian Laws. Apparently, one of the first\r\nsigns of advancing civilization is the fall in the value of women in\r\nmen’s eyes. Not very long after the siege of Troy, husbands must have\r\nceased paying for their wives; for, at a comparatively early date, they\r\ndemanded a price for wedding them. Euripides, born in 480 B.C., made\r\nMedea complain that women had to buy their husbands for great sums of\r\nmoney. In other words, the custom of the wedding portion had come to\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nAs the pressure of economic competition intensifies with social\r\nconsolidation, the family regularly disintegrates, the children\r\nrejecting the parental authority at a steadily decreasing age; until,\r\nfinally, the population fuses into a compact mass, in which all\r\nindividuals are equal before the law, and all are forced to compete\r\nwith each other for the means of subsistence. When at length wealth\r\nhas accumulated sufficiently to find vent through capitalistic methods\r\nof farming and manufacture, children lose all value, for then hiring\r\nlabour is always cheaper than breeding. Thenceforward, among the more\r\nextravagant races, the family dwindles, as in ancient Rome or modern\r\nFrance, and marriage, having become a luxury, decreases. Moreover,\r\nthe economic instinct impels parents to reduce the number of possible\r\ninheritors of their property, that its bulk may not shrink.\r\n\r\nUpon women the effect of these changed conditions is prodigious.\r\nTheir whole relation to society is altered. From a religious sacrament\r\nmarriage is metamorphosed into a civil contract, dissoluble, like other\r\ncontracts, by mutual consent; and, as the obligations of maternity\r\ndiminish, the relation of husband and wife resolves itself into a\r\nsort of business partnership, tending always to become more ephemeral.\r\nFrequent as divorce now is, it was even more so under the Antonines.\r\n\r\nOn men the action of natural selection is, at least, as drastic. The\r\nchange wrought in Roman character in about three hundred years has\r\nalways been one of the problems of history. In the words of Aristotle,\r\nthe primitive Roman “was prone to the love of women.” Strong in his\r\npassions, austere in his life, fierce in his jealousy, he set the\r\nundisputed possession of the female as his supreme happiness. Virginius\r\nslew his daughter to keep her from Appius Claudius, and his comrades in\r\nthe legions washed out his wrong in the Decemvir’s blood; while among\r\nthe stirring ballads of the fabled time which were sung at the farmer’s\r\nfireside, none roused such emotion as the tale of the vengeance wreaked\r\non Tarquin for Lucretia’s death. Compare this virile race with the\r\naristocracy of the middle Empire. By the second century female purity\r\nweighed light against money. Marcus Aurelius is said to have condensed\r\nthe whole economic moral code in one short sentence. His wife,\r\nFaustina, was accused, by scandal, of being the most abandoned woman\r\nof her generation, more notorious even than had been Messalina. When\r\nthe philosopher was urged to repudiate her, he replied, “Then I should\r\nhave to surrender her portion” (the Empire); and he not only lived with\r\nher, but built a temple to her memory. Even if the story be false, it\r\nreflects none the less truly the temper of the age.\r\n\r\nThe minds of noble Romans of the third and fourth centuries, under\r\nthe same impulsion, worked differently from those of their primitive\r\nancestors; they lacked the martial and the amatory instincts. As a\r\ngeneral rule one salient characteristic of the later reigns was a\r\nsexual lassitude yielding only to the most potent stimulants. The same\r\nphenomena were noticed among Frenchmen at the collapse of the Empire,\r\nsince when like symptoms have become notorious in London.\r\n\r\nTaking history as a whole, women seem never to have more than\r\nmoderately appealed to the senses of the economic man. The monied\r\nmagnate seldom ruins himself for love, and chivalry would have been\r\nas foreign to a Roman senator under Diocletian, as it would be now to\r\na Lombard Street banker. On the other hand, in proportion as women’s\r\ninfluence has declined when measured by their power over men, it has\r\nincreased when measured by the economic standard. In many ways the\r\nfemale seems to serve as a vent for the energy of capital almost as\r\nwell as men; in the higher planes of civilization they hold their\r\nproperty in severalty, and, by means of money, wield a power not unlike\r\nFaustina’s. If unmarried, the economic woman competes with the man on\r\nnearly equal terms, and everywhere, and in all ages, the result is not\r\ndissimilar. The stronger and more fortunate members of the sex have\r\ngrown rich and have bought social and political power. Roman politics\r\nunder Septimius Severus and Caracalla was much in the hands of women,\r\nand Julia Mæsa, who was enormously wealthy, carried through a most\r\nfamous intrigue by purchasing the throne for Elagabalus.\r\n\r\nIn Rome, however, there was always a strong admixture of barbaric\r\nblood, and, to the last, the barbarians married for love. Justinian\r\nwas an example. Born of an obscure race of barbarians in the desolate\r\nBulgarian country, he fell uncontrollably in love with Theodora, who\r\nhad scandalized even the theatres of Constantinople. His mother died of\r\nshame; but Justinian persevered, and, while she lived, his devotion to\r\nhis wife never wavered.\r\n\r\nIn Rome and in Byzantium such women were the stronger or the more\r\nfortunate; their counterparts are easily to be found in any economic\r\nage. The fate of the weaker there was slavery; now they are forced by\r\ncompetition into the ranks of the cheapest labour,--a lot, perhaps,\r\nhardly preferable.\r\n\r\nAnd yet art, perhaps, even more clearly than religion, love, or\r\nwar, indicates the pathway of consolidation; for art reflects with\r\nthe subtlest delicacy those changes in the forms of competition\r\nwhich enfeeble or inflame the imagination. Of Greek art, in its\r\nzenith, little need be said; its great qualities have been too fully\r\nrecognized. It suffices to point out that it was absolutely honest,\r\nand that it formed a vehicle of expression as flexible as the language\r\nitself. A temple apparently of marble, was of marble; a colonnade\r\napparently supporting a portico, did support it; and, while the\r\nornament formed an integral part of the structure, the people read it\r\nas intelligently as they read the poems of Homer. Nothing similar ever\r\nflourished in Rome.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Greeks, the Romans were never sensitive or imaginative.\r\nProperly speaking, they had nothing which they could express through\r\nart; they were utilitarian from the outset, and their architecture\r\nfinally took shape in the most perfect system of materialistic building\r\nwhich, probably, has ever existed. Obviously such a system could\r\nonly be matured in a capitalistic society, and, accordingly, Roman\r\narchitecture only reached perfection somewhat late, perhaps, toward the\r\nclose of the first century.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, though vulgar and ostentatious, understood business.\r\nThey knew how to combine economy and even solidity with display.\r\nAs Viollet-le-Duc has observed, “They were rich, and they wanted to\r\nappear so,”[388] but they strove to attain their end without waste.\r\nTherefore they first ran up a cheap core of rubble, bricks, and mortar,\r\nwhich could be put together by rude slave labour under the direction\r\nof an engineer and a few overseers; and their squalid interior they\r\nafterward veneered with marble, adding, by way of ornament, tier above\r\ntier of Greek columns ranged against the walls. That gaudy exterior\r\nhad nothing whatever to do with the building itself, and could be\r\nstripped off without vital injury. From the Greek standpoint nothing\r\ncould be falser, more insulting to the intelligence, or, in a word,\r\nmore plutocratic; but the work was sound and durable, and, to a certain\r\ndegree, imposing from its mass. This system lasted, substantially\r\nunimpaired, even to Constantine or until the final migration of\r\ncapital to the Bosphorus, the only difference between the monuments of\r\nthe fourth century and the first being that the former are somewhat\r\ncoarser, just as the coins of Diocletian are coarser than those of\r\nNero.\r\n\r\nYet, although the monied aristocracy remained supreme down to the\r\nfinal disintegration of the West, emigration began very early to\r\nmodify the base of society, by the injection of a considerable amount\r\nof imaginative blood; and, as early as the reign of Claudius, this\r\nnew store of energy made its presence felt through the outlet of\r\nChristianity. The converts were, of course, the antipodes of the ruling\r\nclass. They were “humiliores,” poor people, below the notice of a rich\r\nman like Tacitus; “quos, ... vulgus Christianos appellabat.”[389]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Christians held a position analogous to that of Nihilists now,\r\nwhom they resembled save in respect to violence. They were socialists\r\nliving under a monied despotism, and they openly prayed for the end of\r\nthe world; therefore they were thought “haters of the human race,”[390]\r\nand they suffered the penalty. Primitive Christianity was incompatible\r\nwith the existence of Roman society, against which it was a protest,\r\nfor it “fully accepted the idea that the rich, if he did not surrender\r\nhis superfluity, kept what belonged to another.”[391] By right the\r\nKingdom of Heaven was closed to the wealthy.\r\n\r\nProbably very few of these early Christians were Italians; most of them\r\nwere from the Levant, and that they were intensely emotional is proved\r\nby their lust for martyrdom--they voluntarily sought death as a means\r\nof glorifying God. One day Arrius Antoninus, proconsul of Asia, having\r\nordered certain Christians arrested, saw all the faithful of the town\r\npresent themselves before his tribunal, demanding to share the fate of\r\nthose chosen for martyrdom. He dismissed them in wrath, telling them\r\nthat if they were so in love with death they might commit suicide;[392]\r\nand Renan’s account of the persecutions under Nero shows an incredible\r\nexaltation.[393]\r\n\r\nAlmost at once the effect of this emotional temperament became\r\nperceptible. The paintings in the catacombs are, perhaps, the oldest\r\nexample of Christian art, and of these M. Vitet thus spoke many years\r\nago:--\r\n\r\n   “These decorations, made with the hand raised, in secret,\r\n    hurriedly, and more for pious reasons than for love of the\r\n    beautiful, nevertheless reveal to the most rebellious eyes\r\n    and in spite of strange negligence and incorrectness, I know\r\n    not what of animation, of youth, of fecundity, and, so to\r\n    speak, a real transformation of that very art which, in the\r\n    service of paganism, seemed then, we are all agreed, dying of\r\n    exhaustion.”[394]\r\n\r\nAs the world disintegrated, and the imagination everywhere acquired\r\npower, and with power wealth and the means of expression, an entirely\r\nnew architecture sprang up in the East, whose growth closely followed\r\nupon the barbarian invasions and the progressive failure of the\r\nRoman blood. The system of construction was Asiatic modified by Greek\r\ninfluences,[395] and with this new construction came an equally new\r\ndecoration, a decoration which once more served as a language.\r\n\r\nMosaics of stone had long been used, but mosaics of glass, which\r\ngive such an incomparable lustre to the dome, were the invention of\r\nLevantine Christians, and seem to have come into general use toward\r\nthe beginning of the fifth century. But the fifth century was the\r\nperiod of the great invasions of Alaric, Attila, and Theoderic, and\r\nduring this period the population of Italy, Macedonia, and Thrace\r\nmust have undergone profound changes. In Italy the whole fabric of\r\nconsolidated society crumbled; south of the Danube it survived, but\r\nsurvived in a modified form, a form on which the recent migrations\r\nleft an unmistakable imprint. Galla Placidia, the first great patron\r\nof the pure Byzantine school, died in 450, after an eventful life\r\nlargely passed among the barbarians, one of whom she married. She began\r\nto embellish Ravenna, and a comparison of these remains with those of\r\nFrance and Italy of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries,\r\nexposes the difference in the forces which moulded these three\r\ncivilizations.\r\n\r\nWith all its grace and refinement the characteristic of Ravenna was not\r\nreligious ecstasy, but rather an absence of fear of the unknown, and a\r\nrespect for wealth. There is nothing mysterious or terrible about these\r\ncharming buildings, which are manifestly rather a glorification of the\r\nEmpire on the Bosphorus, than of the Kingdom of Heaven.\r\n\r\nAt San Vitale it is Justinian, with an aureole about his head and\r\nsurrounded by his courtiers, carrying a gift to the shrine; or\r\nTheodora, blazing with jewels, and followed by the magnificent ladies\r\nof her household. At San Apollinare the long procession of saints are\r\nrichly clad and bear crowns, while the Virgin herself, seated on a\r\nthrone and revered as a sovereign, is as far removed from the vulgar\r\nas Theodora herself. “Byzantine etiquette no longer permits her to be\r\napproached directly; four angels surround her and separate her from\r\nhumanity.”[396] The terrifying was scrupulously avoided. “By a most\r\nsignificant scruple, the artist, in reproducing various episodes of the\r\nPassion, avoided the most painful, the Crucifixion.”[397]\r\n\r\nSaint Sophia offers every indication of having been expressly contrived\r\nto provide the large light spaces needful for such functions as those\r\ndepicted in San Vitale, and the account given by Procopius of its\r\nerection sustains this supposition. According to Procopius, Saint\r\nSophia was a hobby of Justinian, who not only selected the architect\r\nAnthemius because he was the most ingenious mechanic of his age, but\r\nwho also supplied the funds and “assisted it by the labour and powers\r\nof his mind.”[398] The dome, “from the lightness of the building ...\r\ndoes not appear to rest upon a solid foundation, but to cover the\r\nplace beneath as though it were suspended from heaven by the fabled\r\ngolden chain”; and the interior “is singularly full of light and of\r\nsunshine; you would declare that the place is not lighted by the sun\r\nfrom without, but that the rays are produced within itself, such an\r\nabundance of light is poured into this church.”[399] Of the decorations\r\nit is impossible to speak with certainty, since it is probable that the\r\nmosaics which now exist were of a later period.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the most significant phenomenon about the church is\r\nits loneliness; nothing like it was built elsewhere, and the reason\r\nseems plain. There was but one imperial court which needed so superb\r\na setting, and but one emperor who could pay for it. Herein lies the\r\nradical divergence between the East and West; the great tabernacle of\r\nConstantinople stood alone because it represented the wealth, the pomp,\r\nand the imagination of the barbarian shepherd who had been raised by\r\nfortune to be the chief of police of the city where the world’s wealth\r\nhad centralized. In France every diocese had a temple magnificent\r\naccording to its means, some of which exceeded in majesty that of\r\nParis; and the cause was that, in France, the artistic and imaginative\r\ncaste formed a theocracy, who were not hired by king or emperor, but\r\nwho were themselves the strongest force in all the land. In the East,\r\nthe imaginative inroad was not strong enough to cause disintegration,\r\nand the artists always remained wage-earners. In the West, society fell\r\nback a thousand years, and consolidation began afresh. Six centuries\r\nintervened between the death of Galla Placidia and the famous dream of\r\nthe monk Gauzon which contained the revelation of the plan of the Abbey\r\nof Cluny, and yet six hundred years by no means represented the gap\r\nbetween the Franks and the Burgundians, and the Eastern Empire, even\r\nwhen it sank lowest under Heraclius. To Justinian the building of Saint\r\nSophia was a matter of time and money; to Saint Hugh the church of\r\nCluny was a miracle.\r\n\r\nIn France the churches long were miracles; the chronicles are filled\r\nwith the revelations vouchsafed the monks; and none can cross the\r\nthreshold of one of these noble monuments and fail to grasp its\r\nmeaning. They are the most vigorous of all expressions of fear of the\r\nunseen. The Gothic architect heeded no living potentate; he held kings\r\nin contempt, and oftener represented them thrust down into hell than\r\nseated on their thrones. With the enemy who lurked in darkness none\r\nbut the saints could cope, and them he idealized. No sculpture is more\r\nterrible than the demons on the walls of Rheims, none more majestic\r\nand pathetic than that over the door of the Virgin at Paris, while no\r\ncolour ever equalled the windows of Saint Denis and Chartres.\r\n\r\nWith the thirteenth century came the influx of the Eastern trade and\r\nthe rise of the communes. Immediately the glory of the Gothic began to\r\nfade; by the reign of Saint Louis it had passed its prime, and under\r\nPhilip the Fair it fell in full decline. The men who put dead cats\r\nin shrines were not likely to be inspired in religious sculpture. The\r\ndecay, and the reasons for it, can be readily traced in colour.\r\n\r\nThe monks who conceived the twelfth century windows, or painted\r\nthe pictures of the saints, only sought to render an emotion by a\r\nconventional symbol which should rouse a response. Consequently\r\nthey used marvellous combinations of colours, in which blue was\r\napt to predominate, and they harmonized their colours with gold.\r\nViollet-le-Duc has elaborately explained how this was done.[400]\r\nBut such a system was not pretentious, and was incompatible with\r\nperspective. The mediæval burgher, like the Roman, was rich, and wanted\r\nto appear so. He demanded more for his money than a solemn portrait of\r\na saint. He craved a picture of himself, or of his guild, and above all\r\nhe insisted on display. The fourteenth century was the period when the\r\nreds and yellows superseded the blues, and when the sense of harmony\r\nbegan to fail. Furthermore, the burgher was realistic and required a\r\nrepresentation of the world he saw about him. Hence came perspective,\r\nthe abandonment of gold, and the final degradation of colour, which\r\nsank into a lost art. For hundreds of years it has been impossible to\r\nimitate the work of the monks of Saint Denis. In Italy, the economic\r\nphenomena were yet more striking; for Italy, even in the Middle\r\nAges, was always a commercial community, which looked on art with the\r\neconomic eye. One example will suffice,--the treatment of the dome.\r\n\r\nPlaced between the masterpieces of the East and West, and having little\r\nimagination of his own, the Florentine banker conceived the idea of\r\ncombining the two systems and embellishing them in a cheap and showy\r\nmanner. Accordingly on Gothic arches he placed an Eastern dome, and\r\ninstead of adorning his dome with mosaics, which are costly, he had his\r\ninterior painted at about one-quarter of the price. The substitution of\r\nthe fresco for the mosaic is one of the most typical devices of modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of the economic age, when the imagination glowed\r\nwith all the passion of religious enthusiasm, the monks who built\r\nthe abbeys of Cluny and Saint Denis took no thought of money, for\r\nit regarded them not. Sheltered by their convents, their livelihood\r\nwas assured; their bread and their robe were safe; they pandered to\r\nno market, for they cared for no patron. Their art was not a chattel\r\nto be bought, but an inspired language in which they communed with\r\nGod, or taught the people, and they expressed a poetry in the stones\r\nthey carved which far transcended words. For these reasons Gothic\r\narchitecture, in its prime, was spontaneous, elevated, dignified, and\r\npure.\r\n\r\nThe advent of portraiture has usually been considered to portend\r\ndecay, and rightly, since the presence of the portrait demonstrates\r\nthe supremacy of wealth. A portrait can hardly be the ideal of\r\nan enthusiast, like the figure of a god, for it is a commercial\r\narticle, sold for a price, and manufactured to suit a patron’s taste;\r\nwere it made to please the artist, it might not find a buyer. When\r\nportraits are fashionable, the economic period must be well advanced.\r\nPortraiture, like other economic phenomena, blossomed during the\r\nRenaissance, and it was then also that the artist, no longer shielded\r\nby his convent or his guild, stood out to earn his living by the sale\r\nof his wares, like the Venetian merchants whom he met on the Rialto,\r\nwhose vanity he flattered, and whose palaces he adorned. From the\r\nsixteenth century downward, the man of imagination, unable to please\r\nthe economic taste, has starved.\r\n\r\nThis mercenary quality forms the gulf which has divided the art of\r\nthe Middle Ages from that of modern times--a gulf which cannot be\r\nbridged, and which has broadened with the lapse of centuries, until\r\nat last the artist, like all else in society, has become the creature\r\nof a commercial market, even as the Greek was sold as a slave to\r\nthe plutocrat of Rome. With each invention, with each acceleration\r\nof movement, prose has more completely supplanted poetry, while the\r\neconomic intellect has grown less tolerant of any departure from those\r\nrepresentations of nature which have appealed to the most highly\r\ngifted of the monied type among successive generations. Hence the\r\nimperiousness of modern realism.\r\n\r\nThus the history of art coincides with the history of all other\r\nphenomena of life; for experience has demonstrated that, since the\r\nReformation, a school of architecture, like the Greek or Gothic, has\r\nbecome impossible. No such school could exist in a society where\r\nthe imagination had decayed, for the Greek and Gothic represented\r\nimaginative ideals. In an economic period, like that which has followed\r\nthe Reformation, wealth is the form in which energy seeks expression;\r\ntherefore, since the close of the fifteenth century, architecture has\r\nreflected money.\r\n\r\nViollet-le-Duc has said of the Romans, that, like all parvenus, the\r\ntrue expression of art lay, for them, rather in lavish ornament than\r\nin purity of form,[401] and what was true of the third century is true\r\nof the nineteenth. The type of mind being the same, its operation must\r\nbe similar, and the economic, at once ostentatious and parsimonious,\r\nproduces a cheap core fantastically adorned. The Romans perched\r\nthe travesty of a Grecian colonnade upon the summit of a bath or an\r\namphitheatre, while the Englishman, having pillaged weaker nations of\r\ntheir imaginative gems, delights to cover with coarse imitations the\r\nexterior of banks and counting-houses.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though thus alike, a profound difference separates Roman\r\narchitecture from our own; the Romans were never wholly sordid, nor did\r\nthey ever niggle. When they built a wall, that wall was solid masonry,\r\nnot painted iron; and, even down to Constantine, one chord remained\r\nwhich, when struck, would always vibrate. Usurers may have sat in the\r\nSenate, but barbarians filled the legions, and, as long as the triumph\r\nwound its way through the Forum, men knew how to raise triumphal arches\r\nto the victor. Perhaps, in all the ages, no more serious or majestic\r\nmonument has been conceived to commemorate the soldier than the column\r\nof Trajan, a monument which it has been the ambition of our century to\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nIn Paris an imitation of this trophy was erected to the greatest\r\ncaptain of France, and the column of the Place Vendôme serves to\r\nmark the grave of the modern martial blood. Raised in 1810, almost at\r\nthe moment when Nathan Rothschild became despot of the London Stock\r\nExchange, the tide from thence ran swiftly, and, since Sedan, the\r\npresent generation has drained to the lees the cup of realism.\r\n\r\nNo poetry can bloom in the arid modern soil, the drama has died,\r\nand the patrons of art are no longer even conscious of shame at\r\nprofaning the most sacred of ideals. The ecstatic dream, which some\r\ntwelfth-century monk cut into the stones of the sanctuary hallowed by\r\nthe presence of his God, is reproduced to bedizen a warehouse; or the\r\nplan of an abbey, which Saint Hugh may have consecrated, is adapted to\r\na railway station.\r\n\r\nDecade by decade, for some four hundred years, these phenomena have\r\ngrown more sharply marked in Europe, and, as consolidation apparently\r\nnears its climax, art seems to presage approaching disintegration. The\r\narchitecture, the sculpture, and the coinage of London at the close of\r\nthe nineteenth century, when compared with those of the Paris of Saint\r\nLouis, recall the Rome of Caracalla as contrasted with the Athens of\r\nPericles, save that we lack the stream of barbarian blood which made\r\nthe Middle Age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnotes]\r\n\r\n\r\n    [1] _History of Rome_, Mommsen, Dickson’s trans., i. 288, 290.\r\n\r\n    [2] _History of Rome_, Niebuhr, Hare’s trans., i. 576.
