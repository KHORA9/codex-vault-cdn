C. Chang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lao Tzu, Buddha, Confucius\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSome call it \"seeing,\" some call it \"knowing,\" and some describe it in\r\nreligious terms. Whatever the name, it is our reach for a new level of\r\nconsciousness. Of the many forms this search has taken, perhaps the\r\nmost intriguing is Zen. Growing out of the wisdom of China, India, and\r\nJapan, Zen became a powerful movement to explore the lesser-known\r\nreaches of the human mind. Today Zen has come westward, where we are\r\nrediscovering modern significance in its ancient insights. This book is\r\nan attempt to encounter Zen in its purest form, by returning to the\r\ngreatest Zen masters.\r\n\r\nZen teachings often appear deceptively simple. This misconception is\r\ncompounded by the Zen claim that explanations are meaningless. They\r\nare, of course, but merely because genuine Zen insights can arise only\r\nfrom individual experience. And although our experience can be\r\ndescribed and even analyzed, it cannot be transmitted or shared. At\r\nmost, the \"teachings\" of Zen can only clear the way to our deeper\r\nconsciousness. The rest is up to us.\r\n\r\nZen is based on the recognition of two incompatible types of thought:\r\nrational and intuitive. Rationality employs language, logic, reason.\r\nIts precepts can be taught. Intuitive knowledge, however, is different.\r\nIt lurks embedded in our consciousness, beyond words. Unlike rational\r\nthought, intuition cannot be \"taught\" or even turned on. In fact, it is\r\nimpossible to find or manipulate this intuitive consciousness using our\r\nrational mind--any more than we can grasp our own hand or see our own\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe Zen masters devised ways to reach this repressed area of human\r\nconsciousness. Some of their techniques--like meditation--were borrowed\r\nfrom Indian Buddhism, and some--like their antirational paradoxes--may\r\nhave been learned from Chinese Taoists. But other inventions, like\r\ntheir jarring shouts and blows, emerged from their own experience.\r\nThroughout it all, however, their words and actions were only a means,\r\nnever an end.\r\n\r\nThat end is an intuitive realization of a single great insight--that we\r\nand the world around are one, both part of a larger encompassing\r\nabsolute. Our rational intellect merely obscures this truth, and\r\nconsequently we must shut it off, if only for a moment. Rationality\r\nconstrains our mind; intuition releases it.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that the person glimpsing this moment of higher\r\nconsciousness, this Oneness, encounters the ultimate realization that\r\nthere is nothing to realize. The world is still there, unchanged. But\r\nthe difference is that it is now an extension of our consciousness,\r\nseen directly and not analytically. And since it is redundant to be\r\nattached to something already a part of you, there is a sudden sense of\r\nfreedom from our agonizing bondage to things.\r\n\r\nAlong with this also comes release from the constraints of artificial\r\nvalues. Creating systems and categories is not unlike counting the\r\ncolors of a rainbow--both merely detract from our experience of reality,\r\nwhile at the same time limiting our appreciation of the world's\r\nrichness. And to declare something right or wrong is similarly\r\nnearsighted. As Alan Watts once observed, \"Zen unveils behind the\r\nurgent realm of good and evil a vast region of oneself about which\r\nthere need be no guilt or recrimination, where at last the self is\r\nindistinguishable from God.\" And, we might add, where God is also one\r\nwith our consciousness, our self. In Zen all dualities dissolve,\r\nabsorbed in the larger reality that simply is.\r\n\r\nNone of these things is taught explicitly in Zen. Instead they are\r\ndiscovered waiting in our consciousness after all else has been swept\r\naway. A scornful twelfth-century Chinese scholar summarized the Zen\r\nmethod as follows: \"Since the Zen masters never run the risk of\r\nexplaining anything in plain language, their followers must do their\r\nown pondering and puzzling--from which a real threshing-out results.\" In\r\nthese pages we will watch the threshing-out of Zen itself--as its\r\nmasters unfold a new realm of consciousness, the Zen experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAOISM: THE WAY TO ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\nTaoism is the original religion of ancient China. It is founded on the\r\nidea that a fundamental principle, the Tao, underlies all nature. Long\r\nbefore the appearance of Zen, Taoists were teaching the superiority of\r\nintuitive thought, using an anti-intellectualism that often ridiculed\r\nthe logic-bound limitations of conventional Chinese life and letters.\r\nHowever, Taoism was always upbeat and positive in its acceptance of\r\nreality, a quality that also rubbed off on Zen over the centuries.\r\nFurthermore, many Taoist philosophers left writings whose world view\r\nseems almost Zen-like. The early Chinese teachers of meditation (called\r\n_dhyana _in Sanskrit and Ch'an in Chinese) absorbed the Taoist\r\ntradition of intuitive wisdom, and later Zen masters often used Taoist\r\nexpressions. It is fitting, therefore, that we briefly meet some of the\r\nmost famous teachers of Chinese Taoism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAO TZU\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most influential figures in ancient Chinese lore is\r\nremembered today merely as Lao Tzu (Venerable Master). Taoist legends\r\nreport he once disputed (and bettered) the scholarly Confucius, but\r\nthat he finally despaired of the world and rode an oxcart off into the\r\nwest, pausing at the Han-ku Pass--on the insistence of its keeper--to set\r\ndown his insights in a five-thousand-character poem. This work, the Tao\r\nTe Ching (The Way and the Power), was an eloquent, organized, and\r\nlyrical statement of an important point of view in China of the sixth\r\ncentury B.C., an understanding later to become an essential element of\r\nCh'an Buddhism.\r\n\r\nThe word \"Tao\" means many, many things--including the _elan vital _or\r\nlife force of the universe, the harmonious structuring of human\r\naffairs, and--perhaps most important--a reality transcending words.\r\nTaoists declared there is a knowledge not accessible by language. As\r\nthe Tao Te Ching announces in its opening line, \"The Tao that can be\r\nput into words is not the real Tao.\"\r\n\r\nAlso fundamental to the Tao is the unity of mind and matter, of the one\r\nwho knows and the thing known. The understanding of a truth and the\r\ntruth itself cannot be separated. The Tao includes and unifies these\r\ninto a larger \"reality\" encompassing both. The notion that our\r\nknowledge is distinguishable from that known is an illusion.\r\n\r\nAnother teaching of the Tao Te Ching is that intuitive insight\r\nsurpasses rational analysis. When we act on our spontaneous judgment,\r\nwe are almost always better off. Chapter 19 declares, \"Let the people\r\nbe free from discernment and relinquish intellection . . . Hold to\r\none's original nature . . . Eliminate artificial learning and one will\r\nbe free from anxieties.\"1 The wise defer to a realm of insight floating\r\nin our mind beyond its conscious state.\r\n\r\nTaoists also questioned the value of social organization, holding that\r\nthe best government is the one governing least and that \"the wise deal\r\nwith things through non-interference and teach through no-words.\"2\r\nTaoists typically refused to draw value judgments on others' behavior.\r\nLao Tzu asks, \"What is the difference between good and bad?\"3 and\r\nconcludes, \"Goodness often turns out to be evil.\"4 There is complete\r\nacceptance of what is, with no desire to make things \"better.\" Lao Tzu\r\nbelieved \"good\" and \"bad\" were both part of Tao and therefore, \"Even if\r\na man is unworthy, Tao will never exclude him.\"5 If all things are one,\r\nthere can be no critical differentiation of any part. This\r\nconcentration on inner perception, to the exclusion of practical\r\nconcerns, evoked a criticism from the third-century-B.C. Confucian\r\nphilosopher Hsun Tzu that has a curiously modern ring of social\r\nconsciousness. \"Lao Tzu understood looking inward, but knew nothing of\r\nlooking outward. . . . If there is merely inward-looking and never\r\noutward-looking, there can be no distinction between what has value and\r\nwhat has not, between what is precious and what is vile, between what\r\nis noble and what is vulgar.\"6 But the refusal of Lao Tzu to\r\nintellectualize what is natural or to sit in judgment over the world\r\nwas the perfect Chinese precedent for Ch'an.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHUANG TZU\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second important figure in Taoism is the almost equally legendary\r\nteacher remembered as Chuang Tzu, who is usually placed in the fourth\r\ncentury B.C., some two centuries after Lao Tzu. An early historian\r\ntells that once Chuang Tzu was invited to the court to serve as a\r\nminister, an invitation he declined with a typical story: An ox is\r\nselected for a festival and fattened up for several years, living the\r\nlife of wealth and indulgence--until the day he is led away for\r\nsacrifice. At that reckoning what would he give to return to the simple\r\nlife, where there was poverty but also freedom?\r\n\r\nIn Chuang Tzu's own book of wisdom, he also derided the faith in\r\nrationality common to Chinese scholars. To emphasize his point he\r\ndevised a vehicle for assaulting the apparatus of logic--that being a\r\n\"nonsense\" story whose point could only be understood intuitively.,\r\nThere has yet to be found a more deadly weapon against pompous\r\nintellectualizing, as the Ch'an Buddhists later proved with the koan.\r\nChuang Tzu also knew how quickly comedy could deflate, and he used it\r\nwith consummate skill, again paving the way for the absurdist Zen\r\nmasters. In fact, his dialogues often anticipate the Zen _mondo_, the\r\nexchanges between master and pupil that have comic/straight-man\r\novertones.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Chuang Tzu also sometimes anticipates twentieth-century\r\nwriters for the Theater of the Absurd, such as Beckett or Ionesco.\r\nSignificantly, the Columbia scholar Burton Watson suggests that the\r\nmost fruitful path to Chuang Tzu \"is not to attempt to subject his\r\nthoughts to rational and systematic analysis, but to read and reread\r\nhis words until one has ceased to think of what he is saying and\r\ninstead has developed an intuitive sense of the mind moving beyond the\r\nwords, and of the world in which it moves.\"7 This is undoubtedly true.\r\nThe effect of comic parody on logic is so telling that the only way to\r\nreally understand the message is to stop trying to \"understand\" it.\r\n\r\nConcerning the limitations of verbal transmission, Chuang Tzu tells a\r\nstory of a wheelmaker who once advised his duke that the book of\r\nancient thought the man was reading was \"nothing but the lees and scum\r\nof bygone men.\" The duke angrily demanded an explanation--and received a\r\nclassic defense of the superiority of intuitive understanding over\r\nlanguage and logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_I look at the matter in this way; when I am making a wheel, if my\r\nstroke is too slow, then it bites deep but is not steady; if my stroke\r\nis too fast, then it is steady, but does not go deep. The right pace,\r\nneither slow nor fast, cannot get into the hand unless it comes from\r\nthe heart. It is a thing that cannot be put into words; there is an art\r\nin it that I cannot explain to my son. That is why it is impossible for\r\nme to let him take over my work, and here I am at the age of seventy,\r\nstill making wheels. In my opinion, it must have been the same with the\r\nmen of old. All that was worth handing on died with them; the rest,\r\nthey put into their books.8\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nChuang Tzu's parable that perhaps best illustrates the Taoist ideal\r\nconcerns a cook who had discovered one lives best by following nature's\r\nrhythms. The cook explained that his naturalness was easy after he\r\nlearned to let intuition guide his actions. This approach he called\r\npracticing the Tao, but it is in fact the objective of Zen practice as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n_Prince Wen Hui remarked, \"How wonderfully you have mastered your art.\"\r\nThe cook laid down his knife and said, \"What your servant really cares\r\nfor is Tao, which goes beyond mere art. When I first began to cut up\r\noxen, I saw nothing but oxen. After three years of practicing, I no\r\nlonger saw the ox as a whole. I now work with my spirit, not with my\r\neyes. My senses stop functioning and my spirit takes over.\"9\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nWhat he described is the elimination of the rational mind, which he\r\nrefers to as the senses, and the reliance upon the intuitive part of\r\nhis mind, here called the spirit. He explained how this intuitive\r\napproach allowed him to work naturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A good cook changes his knife once a year because he cuts, while a\r\nmediocre cook has to change his every month because he hacks. I've had\r\nthis knife of mine for nineteen years and have cut up thousands of oxen\r\nwith it, and yet the edge is as if it were fresh from the grindstone.\r\nThere are spaces between the joints. The blade of the knife has no\r\nthickness. That which has no thickness has plenty of room to pass\r\nthrough these spaces. Therefore, after nineteen years, my blade is as\r\nsharp as ever.10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu did not see themselves as founders of any\r\nformal religion. They merely described the obvious, encouraging others\r\nto be a part of nature and not its antagonist. Their movement, now\r\ncalled Philosophical Taoism, was eclipsed during the Han Dynasty (206\r\nB.C.-A.D. 220) in official circles by various other systems of thought,\r\nmost particularly Confucianism (which stressed obedience to authority--\r\nboth that of elders and of superiors--and reverence for formalized\r\nlearning, not to mention the acceptance of a structured hierarchy as\r\npart of one's larger social responsibility). However, toward the end of\r\nthe Han era there arose two new types of Taoism: an Esoteric Taoism\r\nthat used physical disciplines to manipulate consciousness, and a\r\nPopular Taoism that came close to being a religion in the traditional\r\nmold. The first was mystical Esoteric Taoism, which pursued the\r\nprolonging of life and vigor, but this gave way during later times to\r\nPopular Taoism, a metaphysical alternative to the comfortless, arid\r\nConfucianism of the scholarly establishment.\r\n\r\nThe post-Han era saw the Philosophical Taoism of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu\r\nemerge anew among Chinese intellectuals, actually coming to vie with\r\nConfucianism. This whole era witnessed a turning away from the accepted\r\nvalues of society, as the well-organized government of the Han era\r\ndissolved into political and intellectual confusion. Government was\r\nunstable and corrupt, and the Confucianism which had been its\r\nphilosophical underpinning was stilted and unsatisfying. Whenever a\r\nsociety breaks down, the belief system supporting it naturally comes\r\nunder question. This happened in China in the third and fourth\r\ncenturies of the Christian era, and from it emerged a natural\r\nopposition to Confucianism. One form of this opposition was the\r\nimported religion of Buddhism, which provided a spiritual solace\r\nmissing in the teachings of Confucius, while the other was a revival\r\namong intellectuals of Philosophical Taoism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKUO HSIANG: A NEO-TAOIST\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this disruptive environment, certain intellectuals returned again to\r\nthe insights of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, creating a movement today known\r\nas Neo-Taoism. One of the thinkers who tried to reinterpret original\r\nTaoist ideas for the new times was Kuo Hsiang (d. ca. 312), who co-\r\nauthored a major document of Neo-Taoism entitled Commentary on the\r\nChuang Tzu. It focused on the important Taoist idea of _wu-wei_, once\r\nexplained as follows: \" . . .to them the key concept of Taoism, _wu\r\n_(literally, nonexistence), is not nothingness, but pure being, which\r\ntranscends forms and names, and precisely because it is absolute and\r\ncomplete, can accomplish everything. The sage is not one who withdraws\r\ninto the life of a hermit, but a man of social and political\r\nachievements, although these achievements must be brought about through\r\n_wu-wei_, 'nonaction' or 'taking no [unnatural] action.' 1,11\r\n\r\nThis concept of _wu-wei _has also been described as abstaining from\r\nactivity contrary to nature and acting in a spontaneous rather than\r\ncalculated fashion. In Kuo Hsiang's words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Being natural means to exist spontaneously without having to take any\r\naction. . . . By taking no action is not meant folding one's arms and\r\nclosing one's mouth. If we simply let everything act by itself, it will\r\nbe contented with its nature and destiny. (12)\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nKuo Hsiang's commentary expanded on almost all the major ideas of\r\nChuang Tzu, drawing out with logic what originally had been set in\r\nabsurdism. Criticizing this, a later Ch'an monk observed, \"People say\r\nKuo Hsiang wrote a commentary on Chuang Tzu. I would say it was Chuang\r\nTzu who wrote a commentary on Kuo Hsiang.\"13 Nonetheless, the idea of\r\n_wu-wei_, processed through Buddhism, emerged in different guise in\r\nlater Ch'an, influencing the concept of \"no-mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN SAGES OF THE BAMBOO GROVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Chinese were content merely to live the ideas of Neo-Taoism.\r\nAmong these were the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, men part of a\r\nlarger movement known as the School of Pure Conversation. Their\r\nfavorite pastime was to gather north of Loyang on the estate of one of\r\ntheir members, where they engaged in refined conversation, wrote poetry\r\nand music, and (not incidentally) drank wine. To some extent they\r\nreflected the recluse ideal of old, except that they found the\r\nsatisfaction of the senses no impediment to introspection. What they\r\ndid forswear, however, was the world of getting and spending. Although\r\nmen of distinction, they rejected fame, ambition, and worldly station.\r\n\r\nThere is a story that one of the Seven Sages, a man named Liu Ling (ca.\r\n221-330), habitually received guests while completely naked. His\r\nresponse to adverse comment was to declare, \"I take the whole universe\r\nas my house and my own room as my clothing. Why, then, do you enter\r\nhere into my trousers.\"14\r\n\r\nIt is also told that two of the sages (Juan Chi, 210-63, and his nephew\r\nJuan Hsien) often sat drinking with their family in such conviviality\r\nthat they skipped the nuisance of cups and just drank directly from a\r\nwine bowl on the ground. When pigs wandered by, these too were invited\r\nto sip from the same chalice. If one exempts all nature--including pigs--\r\nfrom distinction, discrimination, and duality, why exclude them as\r\ndrinking companions?\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most significant insight of the Seven Sages of the\r\nBamboo Grove was their recognition of the limited uses of language. We\r\nare told, \"They engaged in conversation 'til, as they put it, they\r\nreached the Unnameable, and 'stopped talking and silently understood\r\neach other with a smile.' \"1S\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUDDHIST ROOTS OF ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a legend the Buddha was once handed a flower and asked to\r\npreach on the law. The story says he received the blossom without a\r\nsound and silently wheeled it in his hand. Then amid the hush his most\r\nperceptive follower, Kashyapa, suddenly burst into a smile . . . and\r\nthus was born the wordless wisdom of Zen.\r\n\r\nThe understanding of this silent insight was passed down\r\n\r\nthrough the centuries, independent of the scriptures, finally emerging\r\nas the Chinese school of Ch'an, later called Zen by the Japanese. It is\r\nsaid the absence of early writings about the school is nothing more\r\nthan would be expected of a teaching which was, by definition, beyond\r\nwords. The master Wen-yu summed it up when he answered a demand for the\r\nFirst Principle of Ch'an with, \"If words could tell you, it would\r\nbecome the Second Principle.\"\r\n\r\nThis version of Zen's origin is satisfying, and for all we know it may\r\neven be true. But there are other, considerably more substantive,\r\nsources for the ideas that came to flower as Ch'an. Taoism, of course,\r\nhad plowed away at the Confucianist clutter restraining the Chinese\r\nmind, but it was Buddhism that gave China the necessary new\r\nphilosophical structure--this being the metaphysical speculations of\r\nIndia. Pure Chinese naturalism met Indian abstraction, and the result\r\nwas Ch'an. The school of Ch'an was in part the grafting of fragile\r\nforeign ideas (Buddhism) onto a sturdy native species of understanding\r\n(Taoism). But its simplicity was in many ways a re-expression of the\r\nBuddha's original insights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUDDHA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historic Buddha was born to the high-caste family Gautama during\r\nthe sixth century B.C. in the region that is today northeast India and\r\nNepal. After a childhood and youth of indulgence he turned to\r\nasceticism and for over half a decade rigorously followed the\r\ntraditional Indian practices of fasting and meditation, only finally to\r\nreject these in despair. However, an auspicious dream and one final\r\nmeditation at last brought total enlightenment. Gautama the seeker had\r\nbecome Buddha the Enlightened, and he set out to preach.\r\n\r\nIt was not gods that concerned him, but the mind of man and its\r\nsorrowing. We are unhappy, he explained, because we are slaves to our\r\ndesires. Extinguish desire and suffering goes with it. If people could\r\nbe taught that the physical or phenomenal world is illusion, then they\r\nwould cease their attachment to it, thereby finding release from their\r\nself-destructive mental bondage.\r\n\r\nThe Buddha neglected to set down these ideas in written form however,\r\nperhaps unwisely leaving this task to later generations. His teachings\r\nsubsequently were recreated in the form of sermons or sutras. In later\r\nyears, the Buddhist movement split into two separate philosophical\r\ncamps, known today as Theravada and Mahayana. The Theravada Buddhists--\r\nfound primarily in southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, and Burma--venerate the\r\nearly writings of Buddhism (known today as the Pali Canon) and tend to\r\ncontent themselves with practicing the philosophy of the Buddha rather\r\nthan enlarging upon it with speculative commentaries. By contrast, the\r\nfollowers of Mahayana--who include the bulk of all Buddhists in China,\r\nJapan, and Tibet--left the simple prescriptions of the Buddha far behind\r\nin their creation of a vast new literature (in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and\r\nChinese) of complex theologies. Chinese Ch'an grew out of Mahayana, as\r\nof course did Japanese Zen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAGARJUNA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Buddha, perhaps the most important Buddhist figure is the\r\nsecond-century A.D. Indian philosopher Nagarjuna. Some call him the\r\nmost important thinker Asia has produced. According to Tibetan legends\r\nhis parents sent him away from home at seven because an astrologer had\r\npredicted his early death and they wished to be spared the sight. But\r\nhe broke the spell by entering Buddhist orders, and went on to become\r\nthe faith's foremost philosopher.\r\n\r\nToday Nagarjuna is famous for his analysis of the so-called Wisdom\r\nBooks of Mahayana, a set of Sanskrit sutras composed between 100 B.C.\r\nand A.D. 100. (Included in this category are The Perfection of Wisdom\r\nin 8,000 Lines, as well as the Diamond Sutra and Heart Sutra, both\r\nessential scriptures of Zen.) Nagarjuna was the originator of the\r\nMiddle Path, so named because it strove to define a middle ground\r\nbetween affirmation of the world and complete negation of existence.\r\n\r\nReality, said Nagarjuna, cannot be realized through conceptual\r\nconstructions, since concepts are contained inside reality, not vice\r\nversa. Consequently, only through the intuitive mind can reality be\r\napproached. His name for this \"reality\" beyond the mind's analysis was\r\n_sunyata_, usually translated as \"emptiness\" but sometimes as \"the\r\nVoid.\" (_Sunyata _is perhaps an unprovable concept, but so too are the\r\nego and the unconscious, both hypothetical constructs useful in\r\nexplaining reality but impossible to locate on the operating table.)\r\nNagarjuna's most-quoted manifesto has the logic-defying ring of a Zen :\r\n\"Nothing comes into existence nor does anything disappear. Nothing is\r\neternal, nor has anything any end. Nothing is identical or\r\ndifferentiated. Nothing moves hither and thither.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Ch'an teachers interpreted the teaching of _sunyata_, the things\r\nof this world are all a mental creation, since external phenomena are\r\ntransient and only exist for us because of our perception. Consequently\r\nthey are actually \"created\" by our mind (or, if you will, a more\r\nuniversal entity called Mind). Consequently they do not exist outside\r\nour mind and hence are a void. Yet the\r\n\r\nmind itself, which is the only thing real, is also a void since its\r\nthoughts cannot be located by the five senses. The Void is therefore\r\neverything, since it includes both the world and the mind. Hence,\r\n_sunyata_.\r\n\r\nAs a modern Nagarjuna scholar has described _sunyata_, or emptiness, it\r\nis a positive sense of freedom, not a deprivation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ \"This awareness of 'emptiness' is not a blank loss of consciousness,\r\nan inanimate space; rather it is the cognition of daily life without\r\nthe attachment to it. It is an awareness of distinct entities, of the\r\nself, of 'good' and 'bad' and other practical determinations; but it is\r\naware of these as empty structures.\"16\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe Zen masters found ways to achieve the cognition without attachment\r\npostulated by Nagarjuna, and they paid him homage by making him one of\r\nthe legendary twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs of Zen by posthumous\r\ndecree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKUMARAJIVA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian missionary who transmitted the idea of Emptiness to China\r\nwas Kumarajiva (344-413), a swashbuckling guru who, more than any other\r\nindividual, was responsible for planting sophisticated Mahayana\r\nBuddhist ideas in Chinese soil. Before telling his story, however, it\r\nmay be well to reflect briefly on how Buddhism got to China in the\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are records of a Buddhist missionary in China as early\r\nas A.D. 148, historians are hard pressed to find the name of an out-\r\nand-out native Chinese Buddhist before sometime in the third century.\r\nBuddhism, which at first apparently was confused with Taoism, seems to\r\nhave come into fashion after the Neo-Taoists ran out of creative steam.\r\nShortly thereafter, around A.D. 209, intelligible Chinese translations\r\nof Indian Mahayana sutras finally began to become available.\r\n\r\nThere were many things about Buddhism, however, that rubbed Chinese the\r\nwrong way. First there were the practical matters: Buddhism allowed, if\r\nnot encouraged, begging, celibacy, and neglect of ancestors--all\r\npractices to rankle any traditional Chinese. Then there were\r\nfundamental philosophical differences: Buddhism offered to break one\r\nout of the Hindu cycle of rebirth, something the Chinese had not\r\nrealized they needed; and Indian thought was naturally geared to cosmic\r\ntime, with its endless cycles of eons, whereas the Chinese saw time as\r\na line leading back to identifiable ancestors. Early missionaries tried\r\nto gain acceptability for Buddhism by explaining it in Taoist terms,\r\nincluding stretching the two enough to find \"matching concepts\" or\r\nideas with superficial similarity, and they also let out the myth that\r\nthe Buddha was actually Lao Tzu, who had gone on to India after leaving\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nWhen barbarians sacked the Northern Chinese center of Loyang in the\r\nyear 313 and took over North China's government, many of its\r\ninfluential Confucianist scholars fled to the south. These emigres were\r\ndisillusioned with the social ideas of Confucianism and ready for a\r\nsolace of the spirit. Thus they turned for comfort to Buddhist ideas,\r\nbut using Neo-Taoist terminology and often treating Buddhism more as a\r\nsubject for salon speculations than as a religion. By translating\r\nBuddhism into a Neo-Taoist framework, these southern intellectuals\r\neffectively avoided having to grapple with the new ideas in Buddhist\r\nmetaphysics.\r\n\r\nIn North China, the Buddhists took advantage of the new absence of\r\ncompeting Confucianists to move into ruling circles and assume the role\r\nof the literate class. They preached a simple form of Buddhism, often\r\nshamelessly dwelling on magic and incantations to arouse interest among\r\nthe greatest number of followers. The common people were drawn to\r\nBuddhism, since it provided for the first time in China a religion that\r\nseemed to care for people's suffering, their personal growth, their\r\nsalvation in an afterlife. Thus Buddhism took hold in North China\r\nmainly because it provided hope and magic for the masses and a\r\npolitical firewall against Confucianism for the new rulers. As late as\r\nthe beginning of the fifth century, therefore, Buddhism was\r\nmisunderstood and encouraged for the wrong reasons in both north and\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nKumarajiva, who would change all this, was born in Kucha to an Indian\r\nfather of the Brahmin caste and a mother of noble blood. When he was\r\nseven he and his mother traveled to Kashmir to enter Buddhist orders\r\ntogether. After several years of studying the Theravada sutras, he\r\nmoved on to Kashgar, where he turned his attention to Mahayana\r\nphilosophy. At age twenty we find him back in Kucha, being ordained in\r\nthe king's palace and sharpening his understanding of the Mahayana\r\nscriptures. He also, we are told, sharpened his non-Buddhist amorous\r\nskills, perhaps finding consolation in the illusory world of the senses\r\nfor the hollow emptiness of _sunyata_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 382 or 383, he was taken captive and removed to a remote\r\narea in northeastern China, where he was held prisoner for almost two\r\ndecades, much to the dismay of the rulers in Ch'ang-an, who wanted\r\nnothing more than to have this teacher (who was by then a famous\r\nBuddhist scholar) for their own. After seventeen years their patience\r\nran out and they sent an army to defeat his recalcitrant captors and\r\nbring him back. He arrived in Ch'ang-an in the year 401 and immediately\r\nbegan a project crucial to the future of Chinese Buddhism. A modern\r\nscholar of Chinese religion tells what happened next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\". . . Chinese monks were assembled from far and near to work with him\r\nin translating the sacred texts. This was a 'highly structured\r\nproject,' suggestive of the cooperative enterprises of scientists\r\ntoday. There were corps of specialists at all levels: those who\r\ndiscussed doctrinal questions with Kumarajiva, those who checked the\r\nnew translations against the old and imperfect ones, hundreds of\r\neditors, sub-editors, and copyists. The quality and quantity of the\r\ntranslations produced by these men in the space of eight years is truly\r\nastounding. Thanks to their efforts the ideas of Mahayana Buddhism were\r\npresented in Chinese with far greater clarity and precision than ever\r\nbefore. Sunyata--Nagar- juna's concept of the Void--was disentangled from\r\nthe Taoist terminology that had obscured and distorted it, and this and\r\nother key doctrines of Buddhism were made comprehensible enough to lay\r\nthe intellectual foundations of the great age of independent Chinese\r\nBuddhism that was to follow.\"17\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe Chinese rulers contrived to put Kumarajiva's other devotion to use\r\nas well, installing a harem of ten beautiful young Chinese girls for\r\nhim, through whom he was encouraged to perpetuate a lineage of his own.\r\nThis genetic experiment apparently came to nothing, but two native\r\nChinese studying under him, Seng-chao (384-414) and Tao-sheng (ca. 360-\r\n434), would carry his contribution through the final steps needed to\r\nopen the way for the development of Ch'an.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENG-CHAO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe short-lived Seng-chao was born to a humble family in the Ch'ang-an\r\nregion, where he reportedly got his indispensable grounding in the\r\nChinese classics by working as a copyist. He originally was a confirmed\r\nTaoist, but after reading the sutra of Vimalakirti (which described a\r\npious nobleman who combined the secular life of a bon vivant\r\nbusinessman with an inner existence of Buddhist enlightenment, a\r\ncombination instantly attractive to the practical Chinese), Seng-chao\r\nturned Buddhist. In the year 398, at age fifteen, he traveled to the\r\nnorthwest to study personally under the famous Kumarajiva, and he later\r\nreturned to Ch'ang-an with the master.\r\n\r\nConversant first in the Taoist and then in the Buddhist classics, Seng-\r\nchao began the real synthesis of the two that would eventually evolve\r\ninto Ch'an. The China scholar Walter Liebenthal has written that the\r\ndoctrine of Nagarjuna's Middle Path, sinicized by Seng-chao, emerged in\r\nthe later Ch'an thinkers cleansed of the traces of Indian origin. He\r\ndeclares, \"Seng-chao interpreted Mahayana, [the Ch'an founders] Hui-\r\nneng and Shen-hui re-thought it.\"18\r\n\r\nThree of Seng-chao's treatises exist today as the Book of Chao (or Chao\r\nLun), and they give an idea of how Chuang Tzu might have written had he\r\nbeen a Buddhist. There is the distrust of words, the unmistakable\r\npreference for immediate, intuitive knowledge, and the masterful use of\r\nwordplay and paradox that leaves his meaning ambiguous. Most important\r\nof all, he believed that truth had to be experienced, not reasoned out.\r\nTruth was what lay behind words; it should never be confused with the\r\nwords themselves:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"A thing called up by a name may not appear as what it is expected to\r\nappear; a name calling up a thing may not lead to the real thing.\r\nTherefore the sphere of Truth is beyond the noise of verbal teaching.\r\nHow then can it be made the subject of discussion? Still I cannot\r\nremain silent.\"19\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe dean of Zen scholars, Heinrich Dumoulin, declares, \"The\r\nrelationship of Seng-chao to Zen is to be found in his orientation\r\ntoward the immediate and experiential perception of absolute truth, and\r\nreveals itself in his preference for the paradox as the means of\r\nexpressing the inexpressible.\"20 Dumoulin also notes that the Book of\r\nChao regards the way to enlightenment as one of gradual progress.\r\nHowever, the idea that truth can be approached gradually was disputed\r\nby the other major pupil of Kumarajiva, whose insistence that\r\nenlightenment must arrive instantaneously has caused some to declare\r\nhim the ideological founder of Zen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAO-SHENG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous Tao-sheng was the first Chinese Buddhist to advance the idea\r\nof \"sudden\" enlightenment, and as a result he earned the enmity of his\r\nimmediate colleagues--and lasting fame as having anticipated one of the\r\nfundamental innovations of Zen thought. He first studied Buddhism at\r\nLu-shan, but in 405 he moved to Ch'ang-an, becoming for a while a part\r\nof the coterie surrounding Kumarajiva. None of his writings survive,\r\nbut the work of a colleague, Hui-yuan, is usually taken as\r\nrepresentative of his ideas.\r\n\r\nTao-sheng is known today for two theories. The first was that good\r\ndeeds do not automatically bring reward, a repudiation of the Indian\r\nBuddhist concept of merit. The other, and perhaps more important,\r\ndeviation he preached was that enlightenment was instantaneous. The\r\nreason, he said, was simple: since Buddhists say the world is one,\r\nnothing is divisible, even truth, and therefore the subjective\r\nunderstanding of truth must come all at once or not at all. Preparatory\r\nwork and progress toward the goal of enlightenment, including study and\r\nmeditation, could proceed step-by-step and are wholesome and\r\nworthwhile, but to \"reach the other shore,\" as the phrase in the Heart\r\nSutra describes enlightenment, requires a leap over a gulf, a\r\nrealization that must hit you with all its force the first time.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is it that you understand on the other shore? First you\r\ncome to realize--as you can only realize intuitively and directly--that\r\nenlightenment was within you all along. You become enlightened when you\r\nfinally recognize that you already had it. The next realization is that\r\nthere actually is no \"other shore,\" since reaching it means realizing\r\nthat there was nothing to reach. As his thoughts have been quoted: \"As\r\nto reaching the other shore, if one reaches it, one is not reaching the\r\nother shore. Both not-reaching and not-not-reaching are really\r\nreaching. . . . If one sees Buddha, one is not seeing Buddha. When one\r\nsees there is no Buddha, one is really seeing Buddha.\"21\r\n\r\nLittle wonder Tao-sheng is sometimes credited as the spiritual father\r\nof Zen. He championed the idea of sudden enlightenment, something\r\ninimical to much of the Buddhism that had gone before, and he\r\ndistrusted words (comparing them to a net which, after it has caught\r\nthe fish of truth, should be discarded). He identified the Taoist idea\r\nof _wu-wei_ or \"nonaction\" with the intuitive, spontaneous apprehension\r\nof truth without logic, opening the door for the Ch'an mainstay of \"no-\r\nmind\" as a way to ultimate truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYNTHESIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuddhism has always maintained a skeptical attitude toward reality and\r\nappearances, something obviously at odds with the wholehearted\r\ncelebration of nature that characterizes Taoism. Whereas Buddhism\r\nbelieves it would be best if we could simply ignore the world, the\r\nsource of our psychic pain, the Taoists wanted nothing so much as to\r\nhave complete union with this same world. Buddhism teaches union with\r\nthe Void, while Taoism teaches union with the Tao. At first they seem\r\nopposite directions. But the synthesis of these doctrines appeared in\r\nZen, which taught that the oneness of the Void, wherein all reality is\r\nsubsumed, could be understood as an encompassing whole or continuum, as\r\nin the Tao. Both are merely expressions of the Absolute. The Buddhists\r\nunite with the Void; the Taoists yearn to merge with the Tao. In Zen\r\nthe two ideas reconcile.\r\n\r\nWith this philosophical prelude in place, we may now turn to the\r\nmasters who created the world of Zen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART  I\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY MASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    . . . in which a sixth-century Indian teacher of meditation,\r\nBodhidharma, arrives in China to initiate what would become a Buddhist\r\nschool of meditation called Ch'an. After several generations as\r\nwanderers, these Ch'an teachers settle into a form of monastic life and\r\ngradually grow in prominence and recognition. Out of this prosperity\r\nemerges a split in the eighth-century Ch'an movement, between scholarly\r\nurban teachers who believe enlightenment is \"gradual\" and requires\r\npreparation in traditional Buddhism, and rural Ch'anists who scorn\r\nsociety and insist enlightenment is experiential and \"sudden,\" owing\r\nlittle to the prosperous Buddhist establishment. Then a popular teacher\r\nof rural Ch'an, capitalizing on a civil disruption that momentarily\r\nweakens the urban elite, gains the upper hand and emasculates urban\r\nCh'an through his preaching that the authentic line of teaching must be\r\ntraced to an obscure teacher in the rural south, now remembered as the\r\nSixth Patriarch, Hui-neng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\nBODHIDHARMA: FIRST PATRIARCH OF ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a Zen legend that a bearded Indian monk named Bodhidharma (ca.\r\n470-532), son of a South Indian Brahmin king, appeared one day at the\r\nsouthern Chinese port city of Canton, sometime around the year 520.\r\nFrom there he traveled northeast to Nanking, near the mouth of the\r\nYangtze River, to honor an invitation from China's most devout\r\nBuddhist, Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty. After a famous interview in\r\nwhich his irreverence left the emperor dismayed, Bodhidharma pressed\r\nonward to the Buddhist centers of the north, finally settling in at the\r\nShao-lin monastery on Mt. Sung for nine years of meditation staring at\r\na wall. He then transmitted his insights and a copy of the Lankavatara\r\nsutra to a successor and passed on--either physically, spiritually, or\r\nboth. His devotion to meditation and to the aforementioned sutra were\r\nhis legacies to China. He was later honored as father of the Chinese\r\n_Dhyana_, or \"Meditation,\" school of Buddhism, called Ch'an.\r\n\r\nBodhidharma attracted little notice during his years in China, and the\r\nfirst historical account of his life is a brief mention in a chronicle\r\ncompiled well over a hundred years after the fact, identifying him\r\nmerely as a practitioner of meditation. However, later stories of his\r\nlife became increasingly embellished, as he was slowly elevated to the\r\noffice of First Patriarch of Chinese Ch'an. His life was made to\r\nfulfill admirably the requirements of a legend, as it was slowly\r\nenveloped in symbolic anecdotes illustrating the truth more richly than\r\ndid mere fact. However, most scholars do agree that there actually was\r\na Bodhidharma, that he was a South Indian who came to China, that he\r\npracticed an intensive form of meditation, and that a short treatise\r\nascribed to him is probably more or less authentic. Although the legend\r\nattached to this unshaven Indian Buddhist tells us fully as much about\r\nearly Ch'an as it does about the man himself, it is nonetheless the\r\nfirst page in the book of Zen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_[Bodhidharma], the Teacher of the Law, was the third son of a great\r\nBrahmin king in South India, of the Western Lands. He was a man of\r\nwonderful intelligence, bright and far-reaching; he thoroughly\r\nunderstood everything that he had ever learned. As his ambition was to\r\nmaster the doctrine of the Mahayana, he abandoned the white dress of a\r\nlayman and put on the black robe of monkhood, wishing to cultivate the\r\nseeds of holiness. He practiced contemplation and tranquillization; he\r\nknew well what was the true significance of worldly affairs. Inside and\r\noutside he was transpicuous; his virtues were more than a model to the\r\nworld. He was grieved very much over the decline of the orthodox\r\nteaching of the Buddha in the remoter parts of the earth. He finally\r\nmade up his mind to cross over land and sea and come to China and\r\npreach his doctrine in the kingdom of Wei.1\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nChina at the time of Bodhidharma's arrival was a politically divided\r\nland, with the new faith of Buddhism often supplying a spiritual common\r\ndenominator. Bodhidharma happened to appear at a moment when an emperor\r\nin the northwest, the aforementioned Wu (reigned 502-49), had become a\r\nfanatic Buddhist. Shortly after taking power, Wu actually ordered his\r\nimperial household and all associated with the court to take up\r\nBuddhism and abandon Taoism. Buddhist monks became court advisers,\r\nopening the imperial coffers to build many lavish and subsequently\r\nfamous temples.\r\n\r\nEmperor Wu led Buddhist assemblies, wrote learned commentaries on\r\nvarious sutras, and actually donated menial work at temples as a lay\r\ndevotee. He also arranged to have all the Chinese commentaries on the\r\nsutras assembled and catalogued. Concerned about the sanctity of life,\r\nhe banished meat (and wine) from the imperial table and became so lax\r\nabout enforcing criminal statutes, particularly capital punishment,\r\nthat critics credited his good nature with an increase in corruption\r\nand lawlessness. While the Taoists understandably hated him and the\r\nConfucianists branded him a distracted ineffectual sovereign, the\r\nBuddhists saw in him a model emperor. Quite simply, Emperor Wu was to\r\nsouthern Chinese Buddhism what Emperor Constantine was to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was known for his hospitality to visiting Indian monks, and\r\nit is entirely possible he did invite Bodhidharma for an audience.2\r\nAccording to the legend, Emperor Wu began almost immediately to regale\r\nhis visiting dignitary with a checklist of his own dedication to the\r\nfaith, mentioning temples built, clergy invested, sutras promulgated.\r\nThe list was long, but at last he paused, no doubt puzzled by his\r\nguest's indifference. Probing for a response, he asked, \"Given all I\r\nhave done, what Merit have I earned?\" Bodhidharma scowled, \"None\r\nwhatsoever, your majesty.\" The emperor was stunned by this reply, but\r\nhe pressed on, trying another popular question. \"What is the most\r\nimportant principle of Buddhism?\" This second point Bodhidharma\r\nreportedly answered with the abrupt \"Vast emptiness.\"3 The emperor was\r\nequally puzzled by this answer and in desperation finally inquired who,\r\nexactly, was the bearded visitor standing before him--to which\r\nBodhidharma cheerfully admitted he had no idea. The interview ended as\r\nabruptly as it began, with Bodhidharma excusing himself and pressing\r\non. For his first miracle, he crossed the Yangtze just outside Nanking\r\non a reed and headed north.\r\n\r\nThe legend of Bodhidharma picks up again in North China, near the city\r\nof Loyang. The stories differ, but the most enduring ones link his name\r\nwith the famous Shao-lin monastery on Mt. Sung. There, we are told, he\r\nmeditated for nine years facing a wall (thereby inventing \"wall\r\ngazing\") until at last, a pious version reports, his legs fell off. At\r\none time, relates another Zen story, he caught himself dozing and in a\r\nfit of rage tore off his eyelids and cast them contemptuously to the\r\nground, whereupon bushes of the tea plant--Zen's sacramental drink--\r\nsprang forth. Another story has him inventing a Chinese style of boxing\r\nas physical education for the weakling monks at Shao-lin, thereby\r\nfounding a classic Chinese discipline. But the most famous episode\r\nsurrounding his stay at the Shao-lin concerns the monk Hui-k'o, who was\r\nto be his successor. The story tells that Hui-k'o waited in the snows\r\noutside Shao-lin for days on end, hoping in vain to attract\r\nBodhidharma's notice, until finally in desperation he cut off his own\r\narm to attract the master's attention.\r\n\r\nBodhidharma advocated meditation, sutras, and the trappings of\r\ntraditional Buddhism as a way to see into one's own nature. His legends\r\nrepresent Zen in its formative period, before the more unorthodox\r\nmethods for shaking disciples into a new mode of consciousness had been\r\ndevised. However, one of the stories attributed to him by later writers\r\nsounds suspiciously like a Zen mondo (the traditional consciousness-\r\ntesting exchange between master and monk). According to this story, the\r\ndisciple Hui-k'o\r\n\r\nentreated Bodhidharma, saying, \"Master, I have not found peace of mind.\r\nI beg you to pacify my mind for me.\" Bodhidharma replied, \"Bring me\r\nyour mind and I will pacify it for you.\" Hui-k'o was silent for a time,\r\nfinally conceding he could not actually find his mind. \"There,\" said\r\nBodhidharma, \"I have pacified it for you.\" This symbolic story\r\nillustrates eloquently the concept of the mind as a perceiver,\r\nsomething that cannot itself be subject to analysis. Logical\r\nintrospection is impossible. The mind cannot examine itself any more\r\nthan the eye can see itself. Since the mind cannot become the object of\r\nits own perception, its existence can only be understood intuitively,\r\nas Hui-k'o realized when he tried to plumb its whereabouts objectively.\r\n\r\nThe actual teachings of Bodhidharma are not fully known. The first\r\nnotice of the \"blue-eyed barbarian\" (as later Chinese called him) is in\r\nthe Chinese Buddhist history entitled Further Biographies of Eminent\r\nPriests, usually dated around the year 645, more than a century after\r\nhe came to China. This biography also contains the brief text of an\r\nessay attributed to Bodhidharma. At the time it was compiled,\r\nBodhidharma had not yet been anointed the First Patriarch of Zen:\r\nrather he was merely one of a number of priests teaching meditation.\r\nAccordingly there would have been no incentive to embellish his story\r\nwith an apocryphal essay, and for this reason most authorities think it\r\nis authentic.4 A later, more detailed version of the essay by\r\nBodhidharma is contained in the Records of the Transmission of the Lamp\r\n(A.D. 1004). This latter text is usually the one quoted, and it is\r\nagreed to be the superior literary document.5 We are in good company if\r\nwe accept this essay as a more or less accurate record of the thoughts\r\nof the First Patriarch.\r\n\r\nThe text that Bodhidharma left was meant to show others the several\r\nways to enlightenment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_There are many ways to enter the Path, but briefly speaking, they are\r\ntwo sorts only. The one is \"Entrance by Reason\" and the other \"Entrance\r\nby Conduct._\"6_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe first of these paths, the Entrance by Reason, might more properly\r\nbe called entrance by pure insight. The path advocated seems a blending\r\nof Buddhism and Taoism, by which the sutras are used as a vehicle for\r\nleading the seeker first to meditation, and then to a nonliterary state\r\nof consciousness in which all dualities, all sense of oneself as apart\r\nfrom the world, are erased. This is an early and eloquent summary of\r\nZen's objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_By \"Entrance by Reason\" we mean the realization of the spirit of\r\nBuddhism by the aid of scriptural teaching. We then come to\r\n\r\nhave a deep faith in the True Nature which is one and the same in all\r\nsentient beings. The reason that it does not manifest itself is due to\r\nthe overwrapping of external objects and false thoughts. When one,\r\nabandoning the false and embracing the true, and in simpleness of\r\nthought, abides in _pi-kuan _[pure meditation or \"wall-gazing\"], one\r\nfinds that there is neither selfhood nor otherness, that the masses and\r\nthe worthies are of one essence, and firmly holds on to this belief and\r\nnever moves away therefrom. He will not then be guided by any literary\r\ninstructions, for he is in silent communication with the principle\r\nitself, free from conceptual discrimination, for he is serene and not-\r\nacting.7_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBodhidharma is given credit for inventing the term _pi-kuan_, whose\r\nliteral translation is \"wall-gazing,\" but whose actual meaning is\r\nanyone's guess. _Pi-kuan_ is sometimes called a metaphor for the mind's\r\nconfrontation with the barrier of intellect--which must eventually be\r\nhurdled if one is to reach enlightenment. In any case, this text is an\r\nunmistakable endorsement of meditation as a means for tranquilizing the\r\nmind while simultaneously dissolving our impulse to discriminate\r\nbetween ourselves and the world around us. It points out that literary\r\ninstructions can go only so far, and at last they must be abandoned in\r\nfavor of reliance on the intuitive mind.8\r\n\r\nThe other Path (or Tao) he described was called the \"Entrance by\r\nConduct\" and invokes his Indian Buddhist origins. The description of\r\n\"conduct\" was divided into four sections which, taken together, were\r\nintended to subsume or include all the possible types of Buddhist\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_By \"Entrance by Conduct\" is meant the Four Acts in which all other\r\nacts are included. What are the four? 1. How to requite hatred; 2. To\r\nbe obedient to _karma_; 3. Not to seek after anything; and 4. To be in\r\naccord with the _Dharma_.9\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe first Act of Conduct counseled the believer to endure all\r\nhardships, since they are payment for evil deeds committed in past\r\nexistences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_What is meant by \"How to requite hatred\"? Those who discipline\r\nthemselves in the Path should think thus when they have to struggle\r\nwith adverse conditions: During the innumerable past ages I have\r\nwandered through multiplicity of existences, all the while giving\r\nmyself to unimportant details of life at the expense of essentials, and\r\nthus creating infinite occasions for hate, ill-will, and wrong-doing.\r\nWhile no violations have been committed in this life, the fruits of\r\nevil deeds in the past are to be gathered now. Neither gods nor men can\r\nforetell what is coming upon me. I will submit myself willingly and\r\npatiently to all the ills that befall me, and I will never bemoan or\r\ncomplain. In the Sutra it is said not to worry over ills that may\r\nhappen to you. Why? Because through intelligence one can survey [the\r\nwhole chain of causation]. When this thought arises, one is in concord\r\nwith the principle because he makes the best use of hatred and turns it\r\ninto the service of his advance towards the Path. This is called the\r\n\"way to requite hatred._\"10_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe second Rule of Conduct is to be reconciled to whatever comes, good\r\nor evil. It seems to reflect the Taoist attitude that everything is\r\nwhat it is and consequently value judgments are irrelevant. If good\r\ncomes, it is the result of meritorious deeds in a past existence and\r\nwill vanish when the store of causative karma is exhausted. The\r\nimportant thing to realize is that none of it matters anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_We should know that all sentient beings are produced by the interplay\r\nof karmic conditions, and as such there can be no real self in them.\r\nThe mingled yarns of pleasure and pain are all woven of the threads of\r\nconditioning causes. . . . Therefore, let gains and losses run their\r\nnatural courses according to the ever changing conditions and\r\ncircumstances of life, for the Mind itself does not increase with the\r\ngains nor decrease with the losses. In this way, no gales of self-\r\ncomplacency will arise, and your mind will remain in hidden harmony\r\nwith the Tao. It is in this sense that we must understand the rule of\r\nadaptation to the variable conditions and circumstances of life.11\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe third Rule of Conduct was the teaching of the Buddha that a\r\ncessation of seeking and a turning toward nonattachment brings peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Men of the world remain unawakened for life; everywhere we find them\r\nbound by their craving and clinging. This is called \"attachment.\" The\r\nwise, however, understand the truth, and their reason tells them to\r\nturn from the worldly ways. They enjoy peace of mind and perfect\r\ndetachment. They adjust their bodily movements to the vicissitudes of\r\nfortune, always aware of the emptiness of the phenomenal world, in\r\nwhich they find nothing to covet, nothing to delight in. . . . Everyone\r\nwho has a body is an heir to suffering and a stranger to peace. Having\r\ncomprehended this point, the wise are detached from all things of the\r\nphenomenal world, with their minds free of desires and craving. As the\r\nscripture has it, \"All sufferings spring from attachment; true joy\r\narises from detachment.\" To know clearly the bliss of detachment is\r\ntruly to walk on the path of the Tao.12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe fourth Rule of Conduct was to dissolve our perception of object-\r\nsubject dualities and view life as a unified whole. This merging of\r\nself and exterior world Bodhidharma calls pure mind or pure reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dharma is nothing else than Reason which is pure in its essence.\r\nThis pure Reason is the formless Form of all Forms; it is free of all\r\ndefilements and attachments, and it knows of neither \"self\" nor\r\n\"other.\"13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Having set forth this rather elegant statement of Zen and Buddhist\r\nideals, as ascribed to Bodhidharma, it unfortunately is necessary to\r\nadd that it appears to have been taken directly from the Vajrasamadhi\r\nSutra (attributing quotations from the sutras to Patriarchs was\r\ncommon), with the sole exception of the term _pi-kuan_.14 At the very\r\nleast, the legend at this time does not portray Bodhidharma as a\r\ndespiser of the sutras. He was, in fact, using a sutra as a vehicle to\r\npromote his practice of intensive meditation. It is not known what role\r\nmeditation played in Buddhism at this time. However, the scholar Hu\r\nShih questions how well it was understood. \"[An early Buddhist\r\nhistorian's] Biographies, which covered the whole period of early\r\nBuddhism in China from the first century to the year 519, contained\r\nonly 21 names of 'practitioners of _dhyana _(meditation)' out of a\r\ntotal of about 450. And practically all of the 21_dhyana _monks were\r\nrecorded because of their remarkable asceticism and miraculous powers.\r\nThis shows that in spite of the numerous yoga manuals in translation,\r\nand in spite of the high respect paid by intellectual Buddhists to the\r\ndoctrine and practice of _dhyana_, there were, as late as 500,\r\npractically no Chinese Buddhists who really understood or seriously\r\npracticed _dhyana _or Zen.\"15\r\n\r\nPerhaps Bodhidharma, arriving in 520, felt his praise of meditation,\r\nusing the words of an existing sutra, could rouse Chinese interest in\r\nthis form of Buddhism. As it turned out, he was successful beyond\r\nanything he could have imagined, although his success took several\r\ncenturies. As D. T. Suzuki sums it up, \"While there was nothing\r\nspecifically Zen in his doctrine of 'Two Entrances and Four Acts,' the\r\nteaching of _pi-kuan_, wall-contemplation, was what made Bodhidharma\r\nthe first patriarch of Zen Buddhism in China.\"16 Suzuki interprets _pi-\r\nkuan _as referring to the mind in a thoughtless state, in which\r\nmeditation has permitted the rational mind to be suppressed entirely.\r\nThe use of meditation for this goal instead of for developing magical\r\npowers, as had been the goal of earlier _dhyana _masters, seems to have\r\nbeen the profound new idea introduced to China by Bodhidharma.17\r\n\r\nThe passage of Bodhidharma is also swathed in legend. What eventually\r\nhappened to this traveling Indian guru? Did he die of poison, as one\r\nlegend says; or did he wander off to Central Asia, as another reports;\r\nor did he go to Japan, as still another story would have it? The story\r\nthat has been the most enduring (recorded in a Sung work, _Ching-te\r\nch'uan-teng-lu_) tells that after nine years at the Shao-lin monastery\r\ndecided to return to India and called together his disciples to test\r\ntheir attainment. The first disciple reportedly said, \"As I view it, to\r\nrealize the truth we should neither rely entirely on words and letters\r\nnor dispense with them entirely, but rather we should use them as an\r\ninstrument of the Way.\" To this, Bodhidharma replied, \"You have got my\r\nskin.\"\r\n\r\nNext a nun came forward and said, \"As I view it, the Truth is like an\r\nauspicious sighting of the Buddhist Paradise; it is seen once and never\r\nagain.\" To this Bodhidharma replied, \"You have attained my flesh.\"\r\n\r\nThe third disciple said, \"The four great elements are empty and the\r\nfive _skandhas_ [constituents of the personality: body, feelings,\r\nperception, will, and consciousness] are nonexistent. There is, in\r\nfact, nothing that can be grasped.\" To this Bodhidharma replied, \"You\r\nhave attained my bones.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, it was Hui-k'o's turn. But he only bowed to the master and\r\nstood silent at his place. To him Bodhidharma said, \"You have attained\r\nmy marrow.\"18\r\n\r\nAccording to a competing story, Bodhidharma died of poisoning at the\r\nage of 150 and was buried in the mountains of Honan.19 Not too long\r\nthereafter a lay Buddhist named Sung Yun, who was returning to China\r\nafter a trip to India to gather sutras, met Bodhidharma in the\r\nmountains of Turkestan. The First Patriarch, who was walking barefoot\r\ncarrying a single shoe, announced he was returning to India and that a\r\nnative Chinese would arise to continue his teaching. Sung Yun reported\r\nthis to Bodhidharma's disciples on his return and they opened the\r\nmaster's grave, only to find it empty save for the other shoe.\r\n\r\nHow much of the story of Bodhidharma is legend? The answer does not\r\nreally matter all that much. As with Moses, if Bodhidharma had not\r\nexisted it would have been necessary to\r\n\r\ninvent him. Although his first full biography (ca. 645) makes no\r\nparticular fuss over him, less than a century after this, he was\r\ndeclared the founder of Zen, provided with a lineage stretching\r\ndirectly back through Nagarjuna to the Buddha, and furnished an\r\nexciting anecdotal history. Yet as founders go, he was a worthy enough\r\nindividual. He does seem to have devised a strain of Buddhist thought\r\nthat could successfully be grafted onto the hardy native Chinese Taoist\r\norganism. He also left an active disciple, later to be known as the\r\nSecond Patriarch, Hui-k'o, so he must have had either a charismatic\r\npersonality or a philosophical position that distinguished him from the\r\ngeneral run of meditation masters.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep in mind that Bodhidharma, man and myth, was the\r\nproduct of an early form of Zen. The later masters needed a lineage,\r\nand he was tapped for the role of First Patriarch. The major problem\r\nwith Bodhidharma was that many of his ideas were in direct\r\ncontradiction to the position adopted by later Zen teachings. For\r\ninstance, recall that he promoted the reliance on a sutra (the\r\nLankavatara); and he heavily stressed meditation (something later Zen\r\nmasters would partially circumvent). The Jesuit scholar Heinrich\r\nDumoulin has declared that Bodhidharma's attributed teaching in no way\r\ndeviates from the great Mahayana sutras.20 It is, in fact, a far cry\r\nfrom later Zen ideas, says John Wu, the Chinese authority.21 Finally, he\r\nleft no claim to patriarchy, nor did his first biographer offer to do\r\nthis for him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the evolution of Zen is best demonstrated by the slow change in\r\nthe paintings of Bodhidharma, culminating in the latter-day portrayals\r\nof him as a scowling grump. His image became successively more\r\nmisanthropic through the centuries, perhaps as a way of underscoring\r\nthe later Zen practice of establishing a rather dehumanized\r\nrelationship between the Zen master and pupil, as the master shouts,\r\nbeats a monk, and destroys his ego through merciless question-and-\r\nanswer sessions. For all we know, the \"wall-gazing Brahmin\" of ancient\r\nChina may have had a wry smile to go along with his droll sense of\r\nhumor. Perhaps it is fitting to close with the most lasting apocrypha\r\nassociated with his name, to wit the stanza that later masters\r\nattributed to him as an alleged summary of his teaching, but which he,\r\npromulgator of the Lankavatara Sutra, would undoubtedly have disowned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A special transmission outside the sutras;\r\n\r\nNo reliance upon words and letters;\r\n\r\nDirect pointing to the very mind;\r\n\r\nSeeing into one's own nature._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Two\r\n\r\nHUI-K'O: SECOND PATRIARCH OF ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHui-k'o (487-593) first enters the history of Zen as an eager Chinese\r\nscholar devoted to meditation. Wishing to become a disciple of the\r\nfamous Indian monk who had recently installed himself at the Shao-lin\r\nmonastery, Hui-k'o set up a vigil outside the gate. Time passed and the\r\nsnows began to fall, but still Bodhidharma ignored him, declaring, \"The\r\nincomparable doctrine of Buddhism can only be comprehended after a long\r\nhard discipline, by enduring what is most difficult to endure and by\r\npracticing what is most difficult to practice. Men of inferior virtue\r\nare not allowed to understand anything about it.\"1 Finally Hui-k'o\r\ndespaired and resorted to an extreme measure to demonstrate his\r\nsincerity: he cut off his own arm and offered it to the master. (This\r\nact reportedly has been repeated since by an occasional\r\noverenthusiastic Zen novice.) Even a singleminded master of meditation\r\nlike Bodhidharma could not ignore such a gesture, and he agreed to\r\naccept Hui-k'o as his first Chinese disciple.\r\n\r\nUnlike Bodhidharma, Hui-k'o is not a mysterious, legendary figure, but\r\nrather is remembered by a detailed history that interacts periodically\r\nwith known events in Chinese history.2 He came from the Chi family and\r\nwas originally named Seng-k'o, only later becoming known as Hui-k'o.\r\nThe most reliable report has him coming from Wu-lao, with a reputation\r\nas a scholarly intellectual preceding him. Indeed he seems to have been\r\na Chinese scholar in the finest sense, with a deep appreciation of all\r\nthree major philosophies: Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. It was\r\ntoward the last, however, that he\r\n\r\nslowly gravitated, finally abandoning his scholarly secular life and\r\nbecoming a Buddhist monk. He was around age forty, in the prime of what\r\nwas to be a very long life, when he first encountered Bodhidharma at\r\nthe Shao-lin monastery. Whether he lost his arm by self-mutilation, as\r\nthe later Zen chronicles say, or whether it was severed in a fight with\r\nbandits, as the earliest history reports, may never be determined.3 The\r\nlater story is certainly more pious, but the earlier would seem more\r\nplausible.\r\n\r\nFor six years he studied meditation with Bodhidharma, gradually\r\nretreating from the life of the scholar as he turned away from\r\nintellectualism and toward pure experience. When Bodhidharma finally\r\ndecided to depart, he called in all his disciples for the famous\r\ntesting of their attainment recounted in Chapter l.4 Hui-k'o, by simply\r\nbowing in silence when asked what he had attained, proved that his\r\nunderstanding of the master's wordless teaching was superior, and it\r\nwas he who received the Lankavatara Sutra. The event reportedly was\r\nsealed by a short refrain, now universally declared to be spurious, in\r\nwhich Bodhidharma predicted the later division of Ch'an into five\r\nschools:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Originally I came to this land\r\n\r\nTo transmit the Dharma and to save all from error\r\n\r\nA flower with five petals opens;\r\n\r\nOf itself the fruit will ripen.5\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAs the story goes, Hui-k'o remained at the Shao-lin for a while longer\r\nand then went underground, supporting himself through menial work and\r\nlearning about Chinese peasant life firsthand. Reportedly, he wanted to\r\ntranquilize his mind, to acquire the humility necessary in a great\r\nteacher, and not incidentally to absorb the Lankavatara Sutra. When\r\nasked why he, an enlightened teacher, chose to live among menial\r\nlaborers, he would reply tartly that this life was best for his mind\r\nand in any case what he did was his own affair. It was a hard\r\nexistence, but one he believed proper. Perhaps it was in this formative\r\nperiod that the inner strength of Ch'an's first Chinese master was\r\nforged.\r\n\r\nHui-k'o's major concern during this period must inevitably have been\r\nthe study of the Lankavatara Sutra entrusted him by Bodhidharma. The\r\nLankavatara was not written by a Zen master, nor did it come out of the\r\nZen tradition, but it was the primary scripture of the first two\r\nhundred years of Ch'an. As\r\n\r\nD. T. Suzuki has noted, there were at least three Chinese translations\r\nof this Sanskrit sutra by the time Bodhidharma came to China.6 However,\r\nhe is usually given credit, at least in Zen records, for originating\r\nthe movement later known as the Lankavatara school. As the sutra was\r\ndescribed by a non-Ch'an Chinese scholar in the year 645, \"The entire\r\nemphasis of its teaching is placed on Prajna (highest intuitive\r\nknowledge), which transcends literary expression. Bodhidharma, the Zen\r\nmaster, propagated this doctrine in the south as well as in the north,\r\nthe gist of which teaching consists in attaining the unattainable,\r\nwhich is to have right insight into the truth itself by forgetting word\r\nand thought. Later it grew and flourished in the middle part of the\r\ncountry. Hui-k'o was the first who attained to the essential\r\nunderstanding of it. Those addicted to the literary teaching of\r\nBuddhism in Wei were averse to becoming associated with these spiritual\r\nseers.\"7\r\n\r\nThe Lankavatara purportedly relays the thoughts of the Buddha while\r\nensconced on a mountain peak in Sri Lanka. Although the work is\r\nnotoriously disorganized, vague, and obscure, it was to be the stone on\r\nwhich Hui-k'o sharpened his penetrating enlightenment. The major\r\nconcept it advances is that of Mind, characterized by D. T. Suzuki as\r\n\"absolute mind, to be distinguished from an empirical mind which is the\r\nsubject of psychological study. When it begins with a capital letter,\r\nit is the ultimate reality on which the entire world of individual\r\nobjects depends for its value.\"8 On the question of Mind, the\r\nLankavatara has the following to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_. . . the ignorant and the simple minded, not knowing that the world\r\nis what is seen of Mind itself, cling to the multitudinousness of\r\nexternal objects, cling to the notions of being and non-being, oneness\r\nand otherness, bothness and not-bothness, existence and non-existence,\r\neternity and non-eternity. . . .9\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAccording to the Lankavatara, the world and our perception of it are\r\nboth part of a larger conceptual entity. The teachings of the\r\nLankavatara cast the gravest doubt on the actual existence of the\r\nthings we think we see. Discrimination between oneself and the rest of\r\nthe world can only be false, since both are merely manifestations of\r\nthe same encompassing essence, Mind. Our perception is too easily\r\ndeceived, and this is the reason we must not implicitly trust the\r\nimages that reach our consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_. . . [I]t is like those water bubbles in a rainfall which have the\r\nappearance of crystal gems, and the ignorant taking them for real\r\ncrystal gems run after them. . . . [T]hey are no more than water\r\nbubbles, they are not gems, nor are they not-gems, because of their\r\nbeing so comprehended [by one party] and not being so comprehended [by\r\nanother].10\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nReality lies beyond these petty discriminations. The intellect, too, is\r\npowerless to distinguish the real from the illusory, since all things\r\nare both and neither at the same time. This conviction of the\r\nLankavatara remained at the core of Zen, even after the sutra itself\r\nwas supplanted by simpler, more easily approached literary works.\r\n\r\nAs Hui-k'o studied the Lankavatara and preached, he gradually acquired\r\na reputation for insight that transcended his deliberately\r\nunpretentious appearance. Throughout it all, he led an itinerant life,\r\ntraveling about North China. It is reported that he found his way to\r\nthe capital of the eastern half of the Wei kingdom after its division\r\nin the year 534. Here, in the city of Yeh-tu, he taught his version of\r\n_dhyana_ and opened the way to enlightenment for many people. Though\r\nunassuming in manner and dress, he nonetheless aroused antagonism from\r\nestablished Buddhist circles because of his success, encountering\r\nparticular opposition from a conventional _dhyana _teacher named Tao-\r\nhuan. According to _Further Biographies of the Eminent Priests (645)_,\r\nTao-huan was a jealous teacher who had his own following of as many as\r\na thousand, and who resented deeply the nonscriptural approach Hui-k'o\r\nadvocated. This spiteful priest sent various of his followers to\r\nmonitor Hui-k'o's teaching, perhaps with an eye to accusing him of\r\nheresy, but all those sent were so impressed that none ever returned.\r\nThen one day the antagonistic _dhyana_ master met one of those former\r\npupils who had been won over by Hui-k'o's teachings. D. T. Suzuki\r\ntranslates the encounter as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When Tao-huan happened to meet his first messenger, he asked: \"How was\r\nit that I had to send for you so many times? Did I not open your eye\r\nafter taking pains so much on my part?\" The former disciple, however,\r\nmystically answered: \"My eye has been right from the first, and it was\r\nthrough you that it came to squint._\"11_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe message would seem to be that Hui-k'o taught a return to\r\n\r\none's original nature, to the primal man without artificial learning or\r\ndoctrinal pretense. Out of resentment the jealous _dhyana _master\r\nreportedly caused Hui-k'o to undergo official persecution.\r\n\r\nIn later years, beginning around 574, there was a temporary but\r\nthorough persecution of Buddhism in the capital city of Ch'ang-an.\r\nSometime earlier, an ambitious sorcerer and apostate Buddhist named Wei\r\nhad decided to gain a bit of notoriety for himself by attacking\r\nBuddhism, then a powerful force in Ch'ang-an. In the year 567 he\r\npresented a document to the emperor claiming that Buddhism had allowed\r\nunsavory social types to enter the monasteries. He also attacked\r\nworship of the Buddha image on the ground that it was un-Chinese\r\nidolatry. Instead, he proposed a secularized church that would include\r\nall citizens, with the gullible emperor suggested for the role of\r\n\"pope.\" The emperor was taken with the idea and after several years of\r\ncomplex political maneuvering, he proscribed Buddhism in North China.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Hui-k'o was forced to flee to the south, where he took up\r\ntemporary residence in the mountainous regions of the Yangtze River.\r\nThe persecution was short-lived, since the emperor responsible died\r\nsoon after his decree, whereupon Hui-k'o returned to Ch'ang-an.\r\nHowever, these persecutions may have actually contributed to the spread\r\nof his teaching, by forcing him to travel into the countryside.\r\n\r\nThe only authentic fragment of Hui-k'o's thought that has survived\r\nrecords his answer to an inquiry sent by a lay devotee named Hsiang,\r\nwho reportedly was seeking spiritual attainment alone in the jungle.\r\nThe inquiry, which seems more a statement than a question, went as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_. . . he who aspires to Buddhahood thinking it to be independent of\r\nthe nature of sentient beings is to be likened to one who tries to\r\nlisten to an echo by deadening its original sound. Therefore the\r\nignorant and the enlightened are walking in one passageway; the vulgar\r\nand the wise are not to be differentiated from each other. Where there\r\nare no names, we create names, and because of these names, judgments\r\nare formed. Where there is no theorizing, we theorize, and because of\r\nthis theorizing, disputes arise. They are all phantom creations and not\r\nrealities, and who knows who is right and who is wrong? They are all\r\nempty, no substantialities have they, and who knows what is and\r\n\r\nwhat is not? So we realize that our gain is not real gain and our loss\r\nnot real loss. This is my view and may I be enlightened if I am at\r\nfault?12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThis \"question,\" if such it is, sounds suspiciously like a sermon and\r\nstands, in fact, as an eloquent statement of Zen concerns. Hui-k'o\r\nreportedly answered as follows, in a fragment of a letter that is his\r\nonly known extant work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_You have truly comprehended the Dharma as it is; the deepest truth\r\nlies in the principle of identity. It is due to one's ignorance that\r\nthe mani-jewel is taken for a piece of brick, but lo! when one is\r\nsuddenly awakened to self-enlightenment it is realized that one is in\r\npossession of the real jewel. The ignorant and the enlightened are of\r\none essence, they are not really to be separated. We should know that\r\nall things are such as they are. Those who entertain a dualistic view\r\nof the world are to be pitied, and I write this letter for them. When\r\nwe know that between this body and the Buddha, there is nothing to\r\nseparate one from the other, what is the use of seeking after Nirvana\r\n[as something external to ourselves]?13\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHui-k'o insists that all things spring from the one Mind, and\r\nconsequently the ideas of duality, of attachment to this or that\r\nphenomenon, or even the possibility of choice, are equally absurd.\r\nAlthough he knew all too well that enlightenment could not be obtained\r\nfrom teaching, he still did not advocate a radical break with the\r\ntraditional methods of the Buddhist _dhyana_ masters. His style was\r\nunorthodox, but his teaching methods were still confined to lectures\r\nand meditation. This low-key approach was still closer to the tradition\r\nof the Buddha than to the jarring techniques of \"sudden enlightenment\"\r\ndestined to erupt out of Chinese Ch'an.\r\n\r\nToward the end of his life, Hui-k'o was back in Ch'ang-an, living and\r\nteaching in the same unassuming manner. His free-lance style seems to\r\nhave continued to outrage the more conventional teachers, and a later\r\nstory records a martyr's death for him.14 One day, while a learned\r\nmaster was preaching inside the K'uang-chou Temple, Hui-k'o chanced by\r\nand started to chat with the passersby outside. Gradually a crowd\r\nstarted to collect, until eventually the lecture hall of the revered\r\npriest was emptied. This famous priest, remembered as Pien-ho, accused\r\nthe ragged Hui-k'o to the magistrate Che Ch'ung-j'an as a teacher of\r\nfalse doctrine. As a result he was arrested and subsequently executed,\r\nan impious 106-year-old revolutionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Three\r\n\r\n\r\nSENG-TS'AN, TAO-HSIN, FA-JUNG, AND HUNG-JEN:\r\n\r\n                   FOUR EARLY MASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fifth Patriarch,Hung-jen (left)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe master succeeding Hui-k'o was Seng-ts'an (d. 606), who then taught\r\nFa-jung (594-657) and Tao-hsin (580-651), the latter in turn passing\r\nthe robe of the patriarchy to Hung-jen (601-74). The masters Seng-\r\nts'an, Tao-hsin, and Hung-jen are honored today as the Third, Fourth,\r\nand Fifth Patriarchs, respectively, and revered as the torchbearers of\r\nCh'an's formative years. Yet when we look for information about their\r\nlives, we find the sources thin and diffuse. One reason probably is\r\nthat before 700 nobody realized that these men would one day be\r\nelevated to founding fathers, and consequently no one bothered\r\nrecording details of their lives.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventh century the scattered teachers of _dhyana _seem to\r\nhave gradually coalesced into a sort of ad hoc movement--with sizable\r\nfollowings growing up around the better-known figures. A certain amount\r\nof respectability also emerged, if we can believe the references to\r\nimperial notice that start appearing in the chronicles. It would seem\r\nthat the _dhyana_ or Ch'an movement became a more or less coherent\r\nsect, a recognizable if loosely defined school of Buddhism. However,\r\nwhat the movement apparently was striving to become was not so much a\r\nbranch of Buddhism in China as a Chinese version of Buddhism. The men\r\nlater remembered as the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Patriarchs have in\r\ncommon a struggle to bend Buddhist thought to Chinese intellectual\r\nrequirements, to sinicize Buddhism. Whereas they succeeded only in\r\nsetting the stage for this transformation (whose realization would\r\nawait other hands), they did establish a personality pattern that would\r\nset apart all later masters: a blithe irreverence that owed as much to\r\nChuang Tzu as to Bodhidharma.\r\n\r\nWhen reading the biographies that follow, it is useful to keep in mind\r\nthat the explicit details may well have been cooked up in later years\r\nto satisfy a natural Chinese yearning for anecdotes, with or without\r\nsupporting information. Yet the fact that the _dhyana _practitioners\r\neventually became a movement in need of a history is itself proof that\r\nthese men and their stories were not complete inventions. In any case,\r\nthey were remembered, honored, and quoted in later years as the\r\nlegendary founders of Ch'an.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENG-TSAN, THE THIRD PATRIARCH (d. 606)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the Second Patriarch Hui-k'o's successor was\r\ntroublesome even for the ancient Ch'an historians. The earliest version\r\nof his biography (written in 645, before the sect of Ch'an and its need\r\nfor a history existed) declares, \"Before [Hui-k'o] had established a\r\nlineage he died, leaving no worthy heirs.\" When it later became\r\nnecessary for Ch'an to have an uninterrupted patriarchy, a revised\r\nhistory was prepared which supplied him an heir named Seng-ts'an, to\r\nwhom he is said to have transmitted the doctrine.1 The story of their\r\nmeeting recalls Hui-k'o's first exchange with Bodhidharma, save that\r\nthe roles are reversed. The text implies that Seng-ts'an was suffering\r\nfrom leprosy when he first encountered Hui-k'o, and that he implored\r\nthe Master for relief in a most un-Zenlike way, saying: \"I am in great\r\nsuffering from this disease; please take away my sins.\"\r\n\r\nHui-k'o responded with, \"Bring me your sins, and I will take them\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a long silence, Seng-ts'an confessed, \"I've looked, but I cannot\r\nfind them.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Hui-k'o replied, echoing Bodhidharma's classic rejoinder,\r\n\"Behold, you have just been cleansed.\"\r\n\r\nAnother version of the story says Hui-k'o greeted Seng-ts'an with the\r\nwords, \"You are suffering from leprosy; why should you want to see me?\"\r\n\r\nTo this Seng-ts'an responded, \"Although my body is sick, the mind of a\r\nsick man and your own mind are no different.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever actually happened, it was enough to convince Hui-k'o that he\r\nhad found an enlightened being, one who perceived the unity of all\r\nthings, and he forthwith transmitted to Seng-ts'an the symbols of the\r\npatriarchy--the robe and begging bowl of Bodhidharma--telling him that he\r\nshould take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma (the universal truth\r\nproclaimed by Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist organization or\r\npriesthood). Seng-ts'an replied that he knew of the Sangha, but what\r\nwas meant by the Buddha and the Dharma? The answer was that all three\r\nwere expressions of Mind.2\r\n\r\nThis exchange seems to have taken place while Hui-k'o was in the\r\nnorthern Wei capital of Yeh-tu.3 In later years Seng-ts'an found it\r\nnecessary to feign madness (to escape persecution during the anti-\r\nBuddhist movement of 574), and finally he went to hide on Huan-kung\r\nmountain for ten years, where his mere presence reportedly was enough\r\nto tame the wild tigers who had terrorized the people there. The only\r\nsurviving work that purportedly relays his teaching is a poem, said to\r\nbe one of the earliest Ch'an treatises, which is called the _Hsin-hsin-\r\nming_, or \"On the Believing Mind.\"4 It starts off in a lyrical, almost\r\nTaoist, voice worthy of Chuang Tzu, as it celebrates man's original\r\nnature and the folly of striving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_There is nothing difficult about the Great Way\r\n\r\nBut, avoid choosing!\r\n\r\nOnly when you neither love nor hate,\r\n\r\nDoes it appear in all clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not be anti- or pro- anything.\r\n\r\nThe conflict of longing and loathing,\r\n\r\nThis is the disease of the mind.\r\n\r\nNot knowing the profound meaning of things,\r\n\r\nWe disturb our (original) peace of mind to no purpose.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Next, the poem turns to an acknowledgment of the Mahayanist concept of\r\nthe all-encompassing Mind, the greatest single truth of the universe,\r\nand of Nagarjuna's Void, the cosmic emptiness of _sunyata_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Things are things because of the Mind.\r\n\r\nThe Mind is the Mind because of things.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to know what these two are,\r\n\r\nThey are originally one Emptiness.\r\n\r\nIn this Void both (Mind and things) are one,\r\n\r\nAll the myriad phenomena contained in both.6\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe poem closes with an affirmation of the Ch'an credo of unity and the\r\nabsence of duality as a sign of enlightenment.\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIn the World of Reality\r\n\r\nThere is no self, no other-than-self.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nAll that can be said is \"No Duality!\"\r\n\r\nWhen there is no duality, all things are one,\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that is not included.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nThe believing mind is not dual;\r\n\r\nWhat is dual is not the believing mind.\r\n\r\nBeyond all language,\r\n\r\nFor it there is no past, no present, no future.7\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSince the earliest historical sources maintain that Seng-ts'an left no\r\nwritings, some have questioned the attribution of this lilting work to\r\nthe Third Patriarch. Whatever its authorship, the real importance of\r\nthe poem lies in its subtle merging of Taoism and Buddhism. We can\r\nwatch as the voices of ancient China and ancient India are blended\r\ntogether into a perfect harmony until the parts are inseparable. It was\r\na noble attempt to reconcile Buddhist metaphysics with Chinese\r\nphilosophical concepts, and it was successful in a limited way. As for\r\nSeng-ts'an, the legends tell that he finally was overcome by his\r\nlonging for the south and, handing down the symbols of the patriarchy\r\nto a priest named Tao-hsin, he vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAO-HSIN, THE FOURTH PATRIARCH (580-651)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina, whose political turmoil had sent the early Patriarchs scurrying\r\nfrom one small kingdom to another, found unity and the beginnings of\r\nstability under a dynasty known as the Sui (581-618), the first in\r\nthree and a half centuries (since the end of the Han in 220) able to\r\nunify the land.8 This brief dynasty (which soon was replaced by the\r\nresplendent T'ang) came to be dominated by the Emperor Yang, a crafty\r\npolitician who maneuvered the throne away from an elder brother--\r\npartially, it is said, by demonstrating to his parents his independence\r\nof mind by abandoning all the children he begat in the ladies'\r\nquarters. Whereas his father had undertaken the renovation of the North\r\nChinese capital of Ch'ang-an--not incidentally creating one of the\r\nglories of the ancient world and the site of the finest moments of the\r\nlater T'ang Dynasty--Emperor Yang decided to reconstruct the city of\r\nLoyang, some two hundred miles to the east. The result was a \"Western\r\nCapital\" at Ch'ang-an and an \"Eastern Capital\" at Loyang, the latter\r\ncity soon to be the location of some pivotal episodes in Ch'an history.\r\n\r\nFor the construction of Loyang, a fairyland of palaces and gardens,\r\nmillions of citizens were conscripted and tens of thousands died under\r\nforced labor. Emperor Yang's other monument was a grand canal, linking\r\nthe Yellow River in the north with the rich agricultural deltas of the\r\nYangtze in the south, near Nanking. The emperor loved to be barged down\r\nthis vast waterway--journeys that unsympathetic historians have claimed\r\nwere merely excuses to seek sexual diversions away from the capital. In\r\nany case, his extravagances bankrupted the country and brought about\r\nhis overthrow by the man who would become the founder of the T'ang\r\nDynasty, later to reign under the name of Emperor T'ai-tsung (ruled\r\n626-49).\r\n\r\nThe T'ang is universally regarded as one of the great ages of man, and\r\nit is also considered the Golden Age of Ch'an. The founding emperor,\r\nT'ai-tsung, was a wise and beneficent \"Son of Heaven,\" as Chinese\r\nrulers were styled.9 Under his influence, the capital city of Ch'ang-an\r\nbecame the most cosmopolitan metropolis in the ancient world, with such\r\nwidespread influence that when the first visiting Japanese came upon\r\nit, they were so dazzled they returned home and built a replica for\r\ntheir own capital city. The city was laid out as a grid, with lavish\r\nvermilion imperial palaces and gardens clustered regally at one end.\r\nIts inhabitants numbered upward of two million, while its international\r\nmarkets and fleshpots were crowded with traders from the farthest\r\nreaches of Asia and Europe, echoing with a truly astounding cacophony\r\nof tongues: Indian, Japanese, Turkish, Persian, Roman Latin, and\r\nArabic, not to mention the many dialects of Chinese. Christians moved\r\namong the Buddhists, as did Muslims and Jews. Artisans worked with\r\nsilver, gold, jewels, silks, and porcelains, even as poets gathered in\r\nwine shops to nibble fruits and relax with round-eyed foreign serving\r\ngirls. Such were the worldly attractions of Ch'ang-an during the early\r\nseventh century. This new sophistication and urbanization, as well as\r\nthe political stability that made it all possible, was also reflected\r\nin the change in Ch'an--from a concern chiefly of nomadic _dhyana\r\n_teachers hiding in the mountains to the focus of settled agricultural\r\ncommunities centered in monasteries.\r\n\r\nThe growth in Ch'an toward an established place in Chinese life began\r\nto consolidate under the Fourth Patriarch, Tao-hsin, the man whose life\r\nspanned the Sui and the early T'ang dynasties. He is best remembered\r\ntoday for two things: First, he was particularly dedicated to\r\nmeditation, practicing it more avidly than had any _dhyana _master\r\nsince Bodhidharma; and second, he is credited with beginning the true\r\nmonastic tradition for Ch'an. His formation of a self-supporting\r\nmonastic community with its own agricultural base undoubtedly brought\r\nCh'an a long way toward respectability in Chinese eyes, since it\r\nreduced the dependence on begging. Itinerant mendicants, even if\r\nteachers of _dhyana_, had never elicited the admiration in China they\r\ntraditionally enjoyed in the Indian homeland of the Buddha. Begging was\r\nbelieved to fashion character, however, and it never disappeared from\r\nCh'an discipline. Indeed, Ch'an is said to have encouraged begging more\r\nthan did any of the other Chinese Buddhist sects, but as a closely\r\nregulated form of moral training.\r\n\r\nTao-hsin, whose family name was Ssu-ma, came from Honan, but he left\r\nhome at seven to study Buddhism and met the Third Patriarch, Seng-\r\nts'an, while still in his teens. When Seng-ts'an decided to drop out of\r\nsight, he asked this brilliant pupil to take up the teaching of\r\n_dhyana_ and Bodhidharma's Lankavatara Sutra at a monastery on Mt. Lu.\r\nTao-hsin agreed and remained for a number of years, attracting\r\nfollowers and reportedly performing at least one notable miracle. The\r\nstory says that he saved a walled city from being starved out by\r\nbandits by organizing a program of public sutra chanting among its\r\npeople. We are told that the robbers retired of their own accord while,\r\nas though by magic, previously dry wells in the city flowed again. One\r\nday not too long thereafter Tao-hsin noticed an unusual purple cloud\r\nhanging over a nearby mountain. Taking this as a sign, he proceeded to\r\nsettle there (the mountain later became known as Shuang-feng or \"Twin\r\nPeaks\") and found the first Ch'an community, presiding over a virtual\r\narmy of some five hundred followers for the next thirty years.\r\n\r\nHe is remembered today as a charismatic teacher who finally stabilized\r\n_dhyana_ teaching. In an age of political turmoil, many intellectuals\r\nflocked to the new school of Ch'an, with its promise of tranquil\r\nmeditation in uneasy times. Tao-hsin apparently encouraged his\r\ndisciples to operate a form of commune, in which agriculture and its\r\nadministration were merged with the practice of meditation.10 In so\r\ndoing, he seems not only to have revolutionized the respectability of\r\n_dhyana _practice, but also to have become something of a national\r\nfigure himself. This, at any rate, is what we may surmise from one of\r\nthe more durable legends, which has him defying an imperial decree to\r\nappear before the emperor, T'ai-tsung.\r\n\r\nThis legend concerns an episode which allegedly took place around the\r\nyear 645. As the story goes, an imperial messenger arrived one day at\r\nthe mountain retreat to summon him to the palace, but Tao-hsin turned\r\nhim down cold. When the messenger reported this to the emperor, the\r\nresponse was to send back a renewed invitation. Again the messenger was\r\nmet with a refusal, along with a challenge.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish my head, cut it off and take it with you. It may go but my\r\nmind will never go.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this reply reached the emperor, he again dispatched the messenger,\r\nthis time bearing a sealed sword and a summons for the master's head.\r\nBut he also included a contradictory decree requiring that Tao-hsin not\r\nbe harmed. When the master refused a third time to come to the palace,\r\nthe messenger read the decree that his head should be severed. Tao-hsin\r\nobligingly bent over, with the command \"Cut it off.\" But the messenger\r\nhesitated, admitting that the imperial orders also forbade harming him.\r\nOn hearing this Tao-hsin reportedly roared with laughter, saying, \"You\r\nmust know that you possess human qualities.\"11\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Patriarch's teachings are not well known, other than for the\r\nfact that he supposedly devised and promoted new techniques to help\r\nnovices achieve intensive meditation. The following excerpt of his\r\nteaching illustrates his fervor for _dhyana_.\r\n\r\nSit earnestly in meditation! The sitting in meditation is basic to all\r\nelse. By the time you have done this for three to five years, you will\r\nbe able to ward off starvation with a bit of meal. Close the door and\r\nsit! Do not read the sutras, and speak to no man! If you will so\r\nexercise yourself and persist in it for a long time, the fruit will be\r\nsweet like the meat which a monkey takes from the nutshell. But such\r\npeople are very rare.12\r\n\r\nThe de-emphasis on the sutras points the way to later Ch'an.\r\nInterestingly, however, the usefulness of sitting in meditation would\r\nalso come under review in only a few short years, when the new style of\r\nCh'an appeared.\r\n\r\nThe reports of Tao-hsin say that Hung-jen, who was to become the Fifth\r\nPatriarch, was one of his followers and grasped the inner meaning of\r\nhis teaching. It was Hung-jen whom he asked to construct a mausoleum in\r\nthe mountainside, the site of his final repose, and when it was\r\nfinished he retired there for his last meditation. After he passed\r\naway, his body was wrapped in\r\n\r\nlacquered cloth, presenting a vision so magnificent that no one could\r\nbear to close the mausoleum.\r\n\r\nAside from his historical place as the founder of the first real\r\ncommunity for Ch'an, there is little that can be said with assurance\r\nabout Tao-hsin. However, a manuscript discovered early in this century\r\nin the Buddhist caves at Tun-huang purportedly contains a sermon by the\r\nFourth Patriarch entitled \"Abandoning the Body.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The method of abandoning the body consists first in meditating on\r\nEmptiness, whereby the [conscious] mind is emptied. Let the mind\r\ntogether with its world be quieted down to a perfect state of\r\ntranquility; let thought be cast in the mystery of quietude, so that\r\nthe mind is kept from wandering from one thing to another. When the\r\nmind is tranquilized in its deepest abode, its entanglements are cut\r\nasunder. . . . The mind in its absolute purity is like the Void\r\nitself.13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The text goes on to quote both Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, as well as some\r\nof the older sutras, and there is a considerable reference to\r\nNagarjuna's Emptiness. This text, real or spurious, is one more element\r\nin the merging of Taoism and Buddhism that was early Ch'an, even as its\r\nanalysis of the mind state achieved in meditation anticipates later\r\nCh'an teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFA-JUNG, THE ST. FRANCIS OF ZEN (594-657)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the parade of Patriarchs, we should not overlook the maverick Fa-\r\njung, a master who was never officially crowned a Patriarch, but whose\r\nhumanity made him a legend.14 Fa-jung (594-657), whose family name was\r\nWei, was born in a province on the south bank of the Yangtze River and\r\nin his early years was a student of Confucian thought. But before long\r\nhis yearning for spiritual challenge led him to Buddhism. He finally\r\nsettled in a rock cave in the side of a cliff near a famous monastery\r\non Mt. Niu-t'ou, where his sanctity reportedly caused birds to appear\r\nwith offerings of flowers.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Zen chronicle _Transmission of the Lamp _(1004),\r\nsometime between 627 and 649 the Fourth Patriarch, Tao-hsin, sensed\r\nthat a famous Buddhist was living on Mt. Niu-t'ou and went there to\r\nsearch out the man. After many days of seeking, he finally came upon a\r\nholy figure seated atop a rock. As the two meditation masters were\r\nbecoming acquainted, there suddenly came the roar of a tiger from the\r\nbramble farther up the mountain. Tao-hsin was visibly startled, causing\r\nFa-jung--friend of the animals--to observe wryly, \"I see it is still with\r\nyou.\" His meaning, of course, was that Tao-hsin was still enslaved by\r\nthe phenomenal world, was not yet wholly detached from his fears and\r\nperceptions.\r\n\r\nAfter they had chatted a while longer, Fa-jung found occasion to leave\r\nhis seat and attend nature at a detached location. During his absence\r\nTao-hsin wrote the Chinese character for the Buddha's name on the very\r\nrock where he had been sitting. When Fa-jung returned to resume his\r\nplace, he was momentarily brought up short by the prospect of sitting\r\non the Buddha's name. Expecting this, Tao-hsin smiled and said, \"I see\r\nit is still with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe had shown that Fa-jung was still intimidated by the trappings of\r\nclassical Buddhism and had not yet become a completely detached master\r\nof the pure Mind. The story says that Fa-jung failed to understand his\r\ncomment and implored Tao-hsin to teach him Ch'an, which the Fourth\r\nPatriarch proceeded to do.\r\n\r\nTao-hsin's message, once again, was to counsel nondistinction,\r\nnonattachment, nondiscrimination; he said to abjure emotions, values,\r\nstriving. Just be natural and be what you are, for that is the part of\r\nyou that is closest to the Buddhist ideal of mental freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_There is nothing lacking in you, and you yourself are no different\r\nfrom the Buddha. There is no way of achieving Buddhahood other than\r\nletting your mind be free to be itself. You should not contemplate nor\r\nshould you purify your mind. Let there be no craving and hatred, and\r\nhave no anxiety or fear. Be boundless and absolutely free from all\r\nconditions. Be free to go in any direction you like. Do not act to do\r\ngood, nor to pursue evil. Whether you walk or stay, sit or lie down,\r\nand whatever you see happen to you, all are the wonderful activity of\r\nthe Great Enlightened One. It is all joy, free from anxiety--it is\r\ncalled Buddha.15\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAfter Tao-hsin's visit, the birds offering flowers no longer appeared:\r\nevidence, said the later Ch'an teachers, that Fa-jung's physical being\r\nhad entirely vanished. His school on Mt. Niu-t'ou flourished for a\r\ntime, teaching that the goals of Ch'an practice could be realized by\r\ncontemplating the Void of Nagarjuna. As Fa-jung interpreted the\r\nteachings of the Middle Path:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_All talk has nothing to do with one's Original Nature, which can only\r\nbe reached through _sunyata_. No-thought is the Absolute Reality, in\r\nwhich the mind ceases to act. When one's mind is free from thoughts,\r\none's nature has reached the Absolute.16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Although Fa-jung's teachings happened to be transmitted to Japan in\r\nlater years, through the accident of a passing Japanese pilgrim, his\r\nschool did not endure in either country beyond the eighth century. His\r\nwas the first splinter group of Zen, and perhaps it lacked the\r\ninnovation necessary to survive, because it clung too much to\r\ntraditional Buddhism.\r\n\r\nAs Fa-jung's years advanced, he was encouraged to come down from his\r\nmountain and live in a monastery, which his better judgment eventually\r\ncompelled him to do. It is reported that after his final farewell to\r\nhis disciples he was followed down the mountain by the laments of all\r\nits birds and animals. A more ordinary teacher would have been\r\nforgotten, but this beloved St. Francis of Zen became the topic of\r\nlectures and a master remembered with reverence ever after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNG-JEN, THE FIFTH PATRIARCH (601-74)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other well-known disciple of the Fourth Patriarch, Tao-hsin, was\r\nthe man history has given the title of Fifth Patriarch, Hung-jen (601-\r\n74). The chronicles say that he came from Tao-hsin's own province and\r\nimpressed the master deeply when, at age fourteen, he held his own with\r\nthe Fourth Patriarch in an introductory interview. As the exchange has\r\nbeen described, Tao-hsin asked the young would-be disciple his family\r\nname, but since the word for \"family name\" is pronounced the same as\r\nthat for \"nature,\" Hung-jen answered the question as though it had\r\nbeen, \"What is your 'nature'?\"--deliberately misinterpreting it in order\r\nto say, \"My 'nature' is not ordinary; it is the Buddha-nature.\"\r\n\r\nTao-hsin reportedly inquired, \"But don't you have a 'family name'?\"\r\n\r\nTo which Hung-jen cleverly replied, \"No, for the teachings say that our\r\n'nature' is empty.\"17\r\n\r\nHung-jen went on to become the successor to the Fourth Patriarch, with\r\nan establishment where several hundred followers gathered. The\r\nchronicles have little to say about the actual life and teachings of\r\nthe Fifth Patriarch, but no matter. His place in history is secured not\r\nso much for what he said--there is actually very little that can\r\nreliably be attributed to him--but rather for his accidental appearance\r\nat the great crossroads of Zen. Hung-jen and his monastery became the\r\nsymbol of a great philosophical debate that occupied the first half of\r\nthe eighth century, a conflict to be examined in detail in the two\r\nchapters to follow. Suffice it to say here that the chronicles at least\r\nagree that he was an eminent priest and well respected, a man to whom\r\nan early-eighth-century document attributes eleven disciples of note.18\r\nAmong those listed who are particularly important to the events that\r\nfollow are a monk named Shen-hsiu and another named Hui-neng, the men\r\nwhose names would one day be associated with a celebrated midnight\r\npoetry contest in Hung-jen's monastery.\r\n\r\nThis contest eventually came to symbolize the conflict between the\r\nteachings of gradual enlightenment and sudden enlightenment, between\r\nintellectual and intuitive knowledge, between sophisticated urban\r\nBuddhism and unlettered rural teachers, and between promoters of the\r\nabstruse but challenging Lankavatara Sutra sanctioned by Bodhidharma\r\nand the cryptic Diamond Sutra. Quite simply, it was a battle between\r\nwhat would eventually be known as the Northern and Southern schools of\r\nCh'an, and it concerned two fundamentally opposing views of the\r\nfunctions of the human mind. As things turned out, the gradual,\r\nNorthern, Lankavatara Sutra faction went on for years thinking it had\r\nwon--or perhaps not really aware that there was a battle in progress--\r\nwhile the anti-intellectual, Southern, Diamond Sutra faction was\r\ngathering its strength in the hinterlands for a final surge to victory.\r\nWhen the Southern school did strike, it won the war handily and then\r\nproceeded to recast the history of what had gone before, even going so\r\nfar as to put posthumous words of praise for itself into the mouths of\r\nthe once-haughty Northern masters. Thus the mighty were eventually\r\nbrought low and the humble lifted up in the annals of Ch'an. It is to\r\nthe two masters whose names are associated with this battle that we\r\nmust turn next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Four\r\n\r\nSHEN-HSIU AND SHEN-HUI:\r\n\r\n\"GRADUAL\" AND \"SUDDEN\" MASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas the Ch'an Patriarchs of earlier times had been, more often than\r\nnot, fractious teachers ignored by emperors and gentry alike, the T'ang\r\nDynasty saw Ch'an masters rise to official eminence, receiving honors\r\nfrom the highest office in China. The first half of the eighth century\r\nwitnessed what was to be the greatest battle within the school of\r\nCh'an, but it was also the time when Ch'an was finally recognized by\r\nChinese ruling circles. The name most often associated with this\r\nimperial recognition is the famous, or perhaps infamous, Empress Wu.1\r\n\r\nWu was not born to royalty, but in the year 638, when she was thirteen,\r\nshe was placed in Emperor T'ai-tsung's harem as a concubine of\r\nrelatively low rank. Disapproving historians claim that one day she\r\nmanaged to catch the crown prince, the heir apparent to the aging\r\nemperor, in what we today might euphemistically call the bathroom, and\r\nseduced him at a moment when he was without benefit of trousers. Thus\r\nshe was already on familiar terms with the next emperor when her\r\nofficial husband, Emperor T'ai-tsung, went to his ancestors in the\r\nsummer of 649. Although she was only twenty-four years old, custom\r\nrequired that she join all the deceased emperor's concubines in\r\nretirement at a monastery--which ordinarily would have been the last\r\nanyone heard of her. As it happened, however, the new emperor's first\r\nwife was childless, with the effect that he began devoting increasing\r\nattention to a favorite concubine. Knowing of the emperor's earlier\r\nacquaintance and infatuation with Wu, the barren empress recalled her\r\nfrom the convent, intending to divert the emperor from his current\r\nfavorite. The cure, however, turned out to be far more deadly than the\r\nailment.\r\n\r\nThrough an intrigue that apparently included murdering her own child by\r\nthe emperor and then blaming the empress, Wu soon had both the empress\r\nand the competing concubine in prison. Not content with mere\r\nimprisonment for her rivals, she went on to have them both boiled\r\nalive--after first amputating their hands and feet, eliciting a dying\r\ncurse from the concubine that she would return as a cat to haunt Wu. To\r\nescape this curse, Wu permanently banned cats from the imperial\r\ncompound, and eventually persuaded the emperor to move the government\r\nfrom Ch'ang-an to Loyang, where for the next half century she tried to\r\nexorcise the memory of her deed. In late 683 Wu's husband, the emperor,\r\ndied, and for a time she allowed his son, the true heir, to occupy the\r\nthrone--until she could find a pretext to take over the government\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nA couple of years after the emperor's death, when Wu was aged sixty,\r\nshe became infatuated with a lusty peddler of cosmetics and\r\naphrodisiacs, a man whose virility had made him a favorite with various\r\nserving ladies around the palace. To give him a respectable post, she\r\nappointed him abbot of the major Buddhist monastery of Loyang--enabling\r\nhim to satisfy, as it were, a double office in the service of the\r\nstate. His antics and those of his followers did the cause of Buddhism\r\nlittle good over the next few years. When in 695 his arrogance finally\r\nbecame too much even for Wu, she had him strangled by the court ladies\r\nand his body sent back to the monastery in a cart. Although Wu is\r\nremembered today as an ardent Buddhist, some have suggested that her\r\ndevotions turned as much to the claims of fortune telling by Buddhist\r\nnuns (some of whose organizations in Loyang reportedly ran brothels on\r\nthe side) as to a pious concern with Indian philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEN-HSIU (605-706), THE FIRST \"SIXTH PATRIARCH\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is known that around 701 Empress Wu invited an aging Ch'an monk\r\nnamed Shen-hsiu, follower of the Lankavatara school of Bodhidharma, to\r\ncome north to the imperial capital from his monastery in central China.2\r\nHe was over ninety at the time and had amassed a lifelong reputation\r\nfor his rigorous practice of _dhyana_. Shen-hsiu agreed reluctantly,\r\nreportedly having to be\r\n\r\ncarried on a pallet into the presence of the empress. It is said that\r\nWu curtsied to him, an unusual act for a head of state, and immediately\r\nmoved him into the palace, where he seems to have become the priest-in-\r\nresidence. As for why Empress Wu would have chosen to honor a lineage\r\nof Ch'an Buddhism, it has been pointed out that she was at the time\r\nattempting to supplant the established T'ang Dynasty of her late\r\nhusband with one of her own. And since the T'ang emperors had honored a\r\nBuddhist lineage, it was essential that she do the same--but one of a\r\ndifferent school. Shen-hsiu was both eminent and unclaimed, an ideal\r\ncandidate to become the court Buddhist for her fledgling dynasty--which,\r\nneedless to say, was never established. Nonetheless, Shen-hsiu was\r\ngiven the title of \"Lord of the law of Ch'ang-an and Loyang,\" and he\r\npreached to vast crowds drawn from the entire northern regions. To\r\nsolidify his eminence, Wu had monasteries built in his honor at his\r\nbirthplace, at his mountain retreat, and in the capital.\r\n\r\nShen-hsiu, who briefly reigned as the Sixth Patriarch of Ch'an, was\r\ndescribed in the early chronicles as a sensitive and bright child who,\r\nout of despair for the world, early on turned away from Confucianism to\r\nbecome a Buddhist monk. At age forty-six he finally found his way to\r\nthe East Mountain retreat of the Fifth Patriarch, Hung-jen, where he\r\nstudied under the master until achieving enlightenment. As noted\r\npreviously he was among the eleven most prominent individuals\r\nremembered from the monastery of the Fifth Patriarch. He later left the\r\nmonastery and traveled for almost two decades, during which time\r\nanother of the students of Hung-jen, Fa-ju, eclipsed him in fame and\r\nfollowers. However, Shen-hsiu seems to have been the best known Master,\r\neventually becoming the titular head of the Lankavatara faction, also\r\nto be known as the Northern school--possibly because Shen-hsiu brought\r\nit to the urbanized, sophisticated capitals of North China, Loyang and\r\nCh'ang-an. This was Ch'an's most imperial moment, and no less than a\r\nstate minister composed the memorial epitaph for Shen-hsiu's\r\ngravestone. Although his specific teachings are not well known, a verse\r\nsurvives from one of his sermons that seems to suggest that the\r\nteachings of Ch'an were really teachings of the mind and owed little to\r\ntraditional Buddhism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The teaching of all the Buddhas\r\n\r\nIn one's own Mind originally exists:\r\n\r\nTo seek the Mind without one's Self,\r\n\r\nIs like running away from the father.3\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAfter he died a pupil named P'u-chi (d. 739) carried on his\r\norganization in the capital. This was the high point of official Ch'an,\r\nsignifying the moment of the Lankavatara school's greatest prestige.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most important, the success of Shen-hsiu was also the success\r\nof Ch'an, or what appeared to be success. The sect had risen from being\r\nthe passion of homeless teachers of _dhyana _to the object of imperial\r\nhonors in the midst of China's finest moment, the T'ang Dynasty. The\r\nT'ang was an era to be remembered forever for its poetry, its art, its\r\narchitecture, its cultural brilliance.4 Unfortunately for Northern\r\nCh'an, this cultural brilliance was beginning to be the province of\r\ngroups other than the blueblooded gentry that traditionally had\r\ncontrolled China's culture. The glories of the T'ang were to some\r\ndegree the creation of the non-gentry, and an outcast warrior would\r\nbefore long bring the government to its knees, even as an obscure Ch'an\r\nmaster from the rural south was soon to erase Shen-hsiu's seemingly\r\npermanent place in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEN-HUI (670-762), THE \"MARTIN LUTHER\" OF CH'AN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe David to Shen-hsiu's Goliath was a master with a similar- sounding\r\nname: Shen-hui. This theological street fighter was a native of the\r\nprovince of Hupeh, some distance south of the lavish twin T'ang\r\ncaptials of Ch'ang-an and Loyang.5 He began as a Taoist scholar, but\r\nlater turned to Buddhism, traveling even farther south around his\r\nfortieth year to become the disciple of a priest named Hui-neng, whose\r\ntemple was Ts'ao-ch'i, just north of the southern port city of Canton\r\nin Kuangtung province. It will be remembered that Hui-neng (whose\r\nlegend we will explore in the next chapter) had also been a disciple of\r\nthe Fifth Patriarch, Hung-jen, studying alongside Shen-hsiu. Shen-hui\r\nis thought to have studied under Hui-neng for around five years, until\r\nthe latter's death in 713. After this he traveled about China, ending\r\nup at Hua-t'ai, slightly northeast of the capital of Loyang. He seems\r\nto have been a man of charismatic presence, one who inspired followers\r\neasily. Then, in the year 732, at a convocation of Ch'an worthies at\r\nthe temple, he mounted the platform and, in a historic moment, declared\r\nthat the great Ch'an organizations of China, heretofore beholden to\r\nShen-hsiu as Sixth Patriarch, were following a false master.6\r\n\r\n        The historical significance of this convocation and Shen-hui's\r\nattack might be likened to the defiant act of Martin Luther, when he\r\nchallenged church hierarchy in sixteenth-century Germany. With superb\r\naudacity, Shen-hui went on to spell out a new history of Ch'an that\r\nsupported his claims. His revised chronicle culminated with the name of\r\nhis old teacher Hui-neng, theretofore an obscure follower of the Fifth\r\nPatriarch, Hung-jen, whom he declared Sixth Patriarch. He insisted that\r\nShen-hsiu, the man honored by Empress Wu, had posed falsely as the heir\r\nof Hung-jen. The Northern school of Shen-hsiu and his heir, P'u-chi,\r\nhad perpetrated a historical deceit, said Shen-hui, robbing the true\r\nSixth Patriarch, the southerner Hui-neng, of his due recognition. For\r\nShen-hui to have challenged the hand-picked school of the ruling family\r\nwas an incredibly courageous act, but perhaps one that was just\r\naudacious enough to win public sympathy.\r\n\r\nHe touted this new proposition more or less full-time between the years\r\n732 and 745, as he traveled about North China and got to know the\r\nofficials of the T'ang regime. His political standing gradually\r\nimproved and he was eventually invited (in 745, at age seventy-seven)\r\nto Loyang to assume leadership of the great Ho-tse temple. Although the\r\nparticular object of his criticism, Shen-hsiu's disciple P'u-chi, had\r\ndied in 739, Shen-hui's attacks on the lineage continued undiminished.\r\nPolitics finally caught up with him, however, when a follower of Shen-\r\nhsiu's \"Northern\" Ch'an named Lu I, who just happened to be chief of\r\nimperial censors, accused him of plotting against the government\r\n(citing as evidence the large crowds he routinely attracted). Finally,\r\nEmperor Hsuan-tsung (grandson of Empress Wu) himself summoned Shen-hui\r\nfrom Loyang to Ch'ang-an, where he questioned the master and finally\r\nsent him into exile in the deep south. This was about 753. It was at\r\nthis point that Chinese political history and Ch'an collide, for the\r\nthrone was soon to need Shen-hui's help.\r\n\r\nEmperor Hsuan-tsung (reigned 712-756) has been credited by many with\r\nthe wreck of the T'ang Dynasty. At the beginning of his reign the\r\ncapital had been in the east at Loyang (where Empress Wu had moved it.\r\nto escape her memories), but the aristocracy in the west successfully\r\npressured him to bring it back to Ch'ang-an. In his declining years\r\nHsuan-tsung became infatuated with the wife of his son, a lady now\r\ninfamous in Chinese history as Yang Kuei-fei. She subsequently was\r\ndivorced by her husband and became a member of the emperor's harem in\r\n738, coming to enjoy enormous influence in affairs of state. She had\r\nfirst been brought to the emperor's attention by one of her relatives,\r\nand in typical Chinese style she procured government posts for all\r\navailable members of her family. As the poet Tu Fu (712-770) described\r\nher machinations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_So many courtiers now throng around the court\r\n\r\nThat honest men must tremble;\r\n\r\nAnd it's said that the gold plate from the treasury\r\n\r\nHas gone to the kinsmen of Lady Yang.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Although none of these blood relatives ever rose to the rich\r\nopportunities the situation afforded, another of her favorites\r\ncompensated abundantly for their political ineptitude.\r\n\r\nHis name was An Lu-shan, a \"barbarian\" of Turkish extraction, born in\r\n703, who first entered China as a slave to an officer in a northern\r\ngarrison of the empire. After distinguishing himself as a soldier, he\r\ncame to the attention of Yang Kuei-fei, who was so charmed by the man\r\nthat she adopted him as her son. Before long he was a familiar figure\r\nat the court, reportedly very fat and possessing a flair for\r\nentertaining the bored aristocracy by his flippancy. Eventually he was\r\nmade governor of a frontier province, where under pretense of a foreign\r\nthreat he proceeded to recruit an army of alarming proportions and\r\nquestionable allegiance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, back in the capital, Lady Yang and her relatives had taken\r\nover the government, whereupon they unwisely decided that An Lu-shan\r\nshould be brought under firmer control. With their hostility providing\r\nhim just the pretext needed, he marched his new army toward Ch'ang-an,\r\npausing only long enough to conquer Loyang and proclaim himself\r\nemperor. This was in January 756. By July he had also taken Ch'ang-an,\r\nfrom which the royal family had already fled. Conditions deteriorated\r\nsufficiently that the troops supporting the throne demanded, and got,\r\nthe head of Lady Yang Kuei-fei as the price for continued support. (On\r\nimperial orders she was strangled by a eunuch.) In the meantime, the\r\nimperial T'ang forces found reinforcements, including some Arab\r\nmercenaries. After a battle outside Ch'ang-an which left An Lu-shan's\r\nforces in disarray, the rebel was murdered, some say by his own son.\r\nSoon thereafter the victorious mercenaries sacked and looted Loyang,\r\nending forever its prominence in Chinese history. The government of the\r\nT'ang survived, but it was penniless after the many war years in which\r\nit could not enforce taxation.8\r\n\r\nThe time was now 757, some four years after Shen-hui's banishment. The\r\ndestitute government, desperate for money, decided to set up ordination\r\nplatforms in the major cities across China and raise cash by selling\r\ncertificates of investiture for\r\n\r\nBuddhist monks. (Since entry into the priesthood removed an individual\r\nfrom the tax rolls, it was accepted practice for the Chinese government\r\nto require an advance compensation.) Shen-hui's oratorical gifts were\r\nsuddenly remembered by some of his former followers, and the old\r\nheretic was recalled to assist in the fundraising. He was such an\r\neffective fundraiser in the ruined city of Loyang that the government\r\ncommissioned special quarters to be built for him on the grounds of his\r\nold temple, the Ho-tse. (He was later to be remembered as the Master of\r\nHo-tse.)\r\n\r\nThe price for his cooperation seems to have been the official\r\nacceptance of his version of Ch'an's history. In his battle with the\r\nNorthern school of Ch'an he had outlived his opponents and through a\r\nbizarre turn of events had finally won the day. Solely through his\r\npersistence, the obscure Southern Ch'an monk Hui-neng was installed as\r\nSixth Patriarch in Ch'an histories (replacing Shen-hsiu), and one\r\nhistory went so far as to declare Shen-hui himself the Seventh\r\nPatriarch.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical significance of what Shen-hui's \"Southern\" doctrine\r\nbrought to Ch'an has been described as nothing less than a revolution.\r\nA modern Zen scholar has claimed that Shen-hui's revolution produced a\r\ncomplete replacement of Indian Buddhism with Chinese philosophy,\r\nkeeping only the name. Shen-hui, he claims, swept aside all forms of\r\nmeditation or _dhyana _and replaced it with a concept called no-mind:\r\nthe doctrines of \"absence of thought\" and \"seeing into one's original\r\nnature.\"9\r\n\r\nPerhaps this philosophical _coup d'etat _may best be understood by\r\ncomparing the Northern and Southern teachings. The discredited Northern\r\nschool of Shen-hsiu had preached that the road to enlightenment must be\r\ntraversed \"step by step,\" that there were in fact two stages of the\r\nmind--the first being a \"false mind\" which perceives the world\r\nerroneously in dualities, and the second a \"true mind\" which is pure\r\nand transcends all discriminations and dualities, perceiving the world\r\nsimply as a unity. One proceeds from the \"false mind\" to the \"true\r\nmind\" step by step, through the suppression of erroneous thought\r\nprocesses by the practice of _dhyana_ or meditation, in which the mind\r\nand the senses slowly reach a state of absolute quietude.\r\n\r\nThe Southern school took issue with this theory of the mind on a number\r\nof points. To begin, they said that if there really is no duality in\r\nthe world, then how can the mind be divided into \"false\" and \"true\"?\r\nThey argued that the answer quite simply is that there is only one\r\nmind, whose many functions are all merely expressions of single true\r\nreality. The unity of all things is the true reality; our minds are\r\nalso part of this reality; and upon realizing this, you have achieved\r\nthe same enlightenment experience once realized by the Buddha. There is\r\nno \"false mind\" and \"true mind,\" nor is there any need for a long\r\nprogram of _dhyana _to slowly suppress false thoughts. All that is\r\nneeded is to practice \"absence of thought\" and thereby intuitively to\r\nrealize a simple truth: One unity pervades everything. This realization\r\nthey called Buddha-mind, and it could only happen \"all at once\" (not\r\n\"step by step\"), at any time and without warning. This moment of primal\r\nrealization they called \"seeing into one's original nature.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Shen-hui is somewhat vague about exactly what practice should\r\nreplace meditation, the scholar Walter Liebenthal has inferred the\r\nfollowing about Shen-hui's attitude toward \"sudden enlightenment\" as a\r\nreplacement for meditation: \"He seems to have rejected meditation in\r\nthe technical sense of the word. Instead of methodical endeavors\r\ndesigned to promote religious progress he recommends a change of point\r\nof view leading to non-attachment. . . . Non-attachment in this case\r\nmeans that external objects are not allowed to catch our fancy.. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ [A] thing recollected is isolated, it is singled out of the whole,\r\nand is thus an illusion; for all short of the undifferentiated\r\ncontinuum is illusive. The senses work as usual . . . but 'no desire is\r\naroused.' . . . This change happens suddenly, that is, it is not\r\ndependent upon preceding exertions; it can be brought about without\r\nfirst passing through the stages of a career. That is why it is called\r\n'sudden awakening.' _\"10 _\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nLiebenthal interprets Shen-hui as saying that whereas the purpose of\r\nmeditation should be merely to erase our attachment to physical things,\r\nit also removes our cognizance of them, which is not necessarily a\r\nrequirement for nonattachment. It should be possible for us to be aware\r\nof the world without being attached to it and enslaved by it. According\r\nto Shen-hui's sermon:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_      When thus my friends are told to discard as useless all they\r\nhave learned before, then those who have spent fifty or more, or only\r\ntwenty years practicing meditation, hearing this, might be very much\r\npuzzled. . . . Friends, listen attentively, I speak to you of self-\r\ndeception. What does self-deception mean? You, who have assembled in\r\nthis place today, are craving for riches and pleasures of intercourse\r\nwith males and females; you are thinking of gardens and houses. . . .\r\nThe Nirvana Sutra says, \"To get rid of your passions is not Nirvana; to\r\nlook upon them as no matter of yours, that is Nirvana._\"11_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSo far so good; but how do we reach this state of recognition without\r\nattachment? Apparently the way is to somehow find our original state,\r\nin which we were naturally unattached to the surrounding world. The way\r\nis to mentally disassociate ourselves from the turmoil of society that\r\nsurrounds us and look inward, touching our original nature. In this\r\nway, both _prajna _and _samadhi_, awareness and noninvolvement, which\r\nhave been described as the active and passive sides of meditation, are\r\nachieved simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Now, let us penetrate to that state in which we are not attached. What\r\ndo we get to know? Not being attached we are tranquil and guileless.\r\nThis state underlying all motions and passions is called samadhi.\r\nPenetrating to this fundamental state we encounter a natural wisdom\r\nthat is conscious of this original tranquility and guilelessness. This\r\nwisdom is called _prajna_. The intimate relation between _samadhi _and\r\n_prajna _is thus defined.\r\n\r\n. . . If now you penetrate to that state in which your mind is not\r\nattached, and yet remains open to impressions, and thus are conscious\r\nof the fact that your mind is not attached, then you have reached the\r\nstate of original blankness and tranquility. From that state of\r\nblankness and tranquility there arises an inner knowledge through which\r\nblue, yellow, red, and white things in this world are well\r\ndistinguished. That is _prajna_. Yet no desires arise from these\r\ndistinctions. That is _samadhi_.\r\n\r\n. . . It follows that freedom from attachment (to external things,\r\nwhich replaces meditation in Ch'an Buddhism), enables you to look into\r\nthe heart of all the Buddhas of the past, and yet it is nothing else\r\nthan what you yourselves experience today.12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most revolutionary thing about this approach was that it\r\nseemed to eliminate the need for all the traditional apparatus of\r\nBuddhism. It had little or nothing to do with organized religion, and\r\neven less connection with the mountains of Indian philosophy that had\r\ngone before. A thousand years of Indian thought had been distilled down\r\nto a single truth: The realization of our original nature comprises\r\nenlightenment. If this were taken at face value, then there was no\r\nlonger any need for the Buddhist community, the sutras, the chanting,\r\neven meditation. There was, in fact, no longer any need for Buddhism.\r\nIt had been reduced, as the Chinese scholar Wing-tsit Chan has\r\nobserved, to a concern for the mind alone.\r\n\r\nBy redefining meditation, Shen-hui had \"laid the foundations of Chinese\r\nZen which was no Zen at all.\"13 As Shen-hui now described meditation or\r\n_dhyana_: Sitting motionless is no _dhyana_; introspection into your\r\nown mind is no _dhyana_; and looking inward at your own calmness is no\r\n_dhyana_.14. . . Here in my school, to have no thoughts is sitting, and\r\nto see one's original nature is _dhyana_ (Ch'an).15\r\n\r\nWhat happened to Indian meditation? No wonder the scholar Hu Shih has\r\ndescribed this new teaching as a Chinese revolt against Buddhism.\r\n\r\nThe political triumph of Shen-hui made Southern Ch'an the official\r\nsect, but it also meant that he, now one of the leading religious\r\nfigures in China, had necessarily become a part of the ruling\r\nestablishment. Little wonder that the actual future of Ch'an soon\r\nreverted back to rural teachers, men who could more convincingly claim\r\nto despise the ways of the world, as they meditated in their secluded\r\nmountain retreats far from imperial patronage. Shen-hui's school of\r\n\"Southern\" Ch'an of Ho-tse temple, which had established dominance in\r\nthe north, was soon to be eclipsed by these new vigorous but unlettered\r\nrural Ch'anists.16 Interestingly, the official recognition of the court\r\nseemed to quickly extinguish any school of Ch'an that received it.\r\nShen-hsiu was honored by Empress Wu, and his school was then supplanted\r\nby that of Shen-hui, whose own imperial recognition and honors were\r\nsoon to be dust in the history of Ch'an, as the new rural school burst\r\non the scene and effectively took over.17\r\n\r\nThe disorders surrounding and following the rebellion of An Lu-shan are\r\ncommonly considered today as signaling the decline of the great age of\r\nthe T'ang Dynasty. They certainly signified the atrophy of the war-torn\r\nNorth Chinese capitals as the political power in China. Loyang and\r\nCh'ang-an came to be replaced in economic influence by the south, a\r\nregion relatively untouched by the constant struggles North China had\r\nto mount against barbarian invaders. Northern scholars retired to the\r\npastoral south, where they lazed in peaceful gardens and recalled the\r\ngreat poets of the early T'ang. Thus Northern urban Ch'an followed the\r\ngeneral demise of North Chinese political strength.\r\n\r\nWas Shen-hui really the father of the new \"meditationless\" Ch'an of the\r\nmind? Some traditional scholars claim it was not really Shen-hui who\r\nrevolutionized Ch'an, but rather his master, the Southern teacher Hui-\r\nneng. For example, D. T. Suzuki believed that whereas Shen-hui was\r\ncorrect in equating meditation with the primal knowledge of self called\r\n_prajna_, he actually taught that this knowledge came about through\r\nrational understanding rather than intuition.18 It was Hui-neng, said\r\nSuzuki, who correctly understood that _prajna_ was intuition and who\r\nknew that it could be realized only through the \"sudden\" path rather\r\nthan through the \"step-by-step\" path. This may well have been true.\r\nJust as the Apostle Paul interpreted the teachings of an obscure\r\nprovincial teacher, Jesus of Nazareth, and popularized them among the\r\nurban centers of the Roman Empire, so Shen-hui dispensed the ideas of\r\nHui-neng in northern cities, possibly tempering them where necessary to\r\ngain acceptance from the more rationally inclined urban Ch'anists. To\r\ncontinue the analogy, Shen-hui (like Paul) never quotes his mentor\r\ndirectly in his writings--something he certainly would have done if\r\nthere had been anything to quote--but in a few decades there would be a\r\nfull autobiography of Hui-neng complete with a \"sermon.\" Shen-hui's own\r\ncontribution was to open the way for the anti-meditation rural school\r\nto take over Ch'an. We may now turn to the legendary Hui-neng,\r\nremembered as the \"Sixth Patriarch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Five\r\n\r\nHUI-NENG:\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH PATRIARCH AND FATHER OF MODERN ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe master honored today as the father of modern Zen was an\r\nimpoverished country lad from South China, whose attributed\r\nautobiography, The Platform Sutra of Hui-neng, is the only \"sutra\" of\r\nBuddhism written by a Chinese.1 In this work, Hui-neng (638-713) told\r\nthe story of his rise from obscurity to fame. He described his father\r\nas a high Chinese official who, unjustly banished and reduced to a\r\ncommoner, died of shame while Hui-neng was still a small child. To\r\nsurvive, the fatherless boy and his mother sold wood in the marketplace\r\nat Han-hai, near Canton in South China. Then one day he chanced to\r\noverhear a man reciting a passage from the Diamond Sutra. Hui-neng\r\nstopped to listen, and when he heard the phrase \"Let your mind function\r\nfreely, without abiding anywhere or in anything,\" he was suddenly\r\nawakened. Upon inquiry, he discovered that the reciter was a follower\r\nof the Fifth Patriarch, Hung-jen. This teacher, the stranger said,\r\ntaught that by reciting the Diamond Sutra it was possible to see into\r\none's own nature and to directly experience enlightenment.\r\n\r\nThe Diamond Sutra (sometimes called the Vajracchedika Sutra) became the\r\npassion of Hui-neng as well as the touchstone for the new Chinese\r\nCh'an. An unusually brief work, it has been called the ultimate\r\ndistillation of the Buddhist Wisdom Literature. The following excerpt\r\nis representative of its teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_All the mind's arbitrary concepts of matter, phenomena, and of all\r\nconditioning factors and all conceptions and ideas relating thereto are\r\nlike a dream, a phantasm, a bubble, a shadow, the evanescent dew, the\r\nlightning's flash. Every true disciple should thus look upon all\r\nphenomena and upon all the activities of the mind, and keep his mind\r\nempty and selfless and tranquil.2\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe Diamond Sutra does not search the philosophic heights of the\r\nLankavatara Sutra, the treatise revered by the early _dhyana _school of\r\nBodhidharma, and precisely for this reason it appealed to the Southern\r\nschool--whose goal was the simplification of Ch'an. Hui-neng could not\r\nresist the call and immediately set out for the East Mountain monastery\r\nof the Fifth Patriarch.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived, Hung-jen opened the interview by asking the newcomer\r\nhis origin. Hearing that he was from the Canton region, the old priest\r\nsighed, \"If you're from the south you must be a barbarian. How do you\r\nexpect to become enlightened?\" To this Hui-neng shot back, \"The people\r\nin the north and south may be different, but enlightenment is the same\r\nin both regions.\" Although this impertinence caused the master to\r\nimmediately recognize Hui-neng's mental gifts, he said nothing and\r\nsimply put him to work threshing and pounding rice. (This exchange,\r\nincidentally, will be recognized as the memorable first encounter\r\nbetween two generations of masters, an obligatory element in all the\r\nlegends of the early Patriarchs.)\r\n\r\nFor the next eight months, the young novice toiled in obscurity, never\r\nso much as seeing the Fifth Patriarch. Then one day the old priest\r\ncalled an assembly and announced that he was ready to pass on the robe\r\nof the patriarchy to the one who could compose a verse showing an\r\nintuitive understanding of his own inner nature. The disciples talked\r\nover this challenge among themselves and decided, \"The robe is certain\r\nto be handed down to Shen-hsiu, who is head monk and the natural heir.\r\nHe will be a worthy successor to the master, so we will not bother\r\ncomposing a verse.\"\r\n\r\nShen-hsiu, the same master later exalted by the Empress Wu in Loyang,\r\nknew what was expected of him and began struggling to compose the\r\nverse. After several days' effort, he found the courage to write an\r\nunsigned _gatha _on a corridor wall in the dark of night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our body is the Bodhi-tree\r\n\r\nAnd our mind a mirror bright.\r\n\r\nCarefully we wipe them hour by hour,\r\n\r\nAnd let no dust alight.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When the Fifth Patriarch saw the verse, he convened an assembly in the\r\ncorridor, burned incense, and declared that they all should recite the\r\nanonymous passage. Afterward, however, he summoned Shen-hsiu to his\r\nprivate quarters and inquired if he was author of the verse. Receiving\r\nan affirmative reply, the master said, \"This verse does not demonstrate\r\nthat you have yet achieved true understanding of your original nature.\r\nYou have reached the front gate, but you have not yet entered into full\r\nunderstanding. Prepare your mind more fully and when you are ready,\r\nsubmit another _gatha_.\" It is a Ch'an commonplace that Shen-hsiu's\r\nverse stressed methodical practice and was perfectly logical--just the\r\nopposite of the sudden, anti-logical leap of intuition that is true\r\nenlightenment. Shen-hsiu departed, but try as he might he could not\r\nproduce the second _gatha_.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Hui-neng overheard the monks reciting Shen-hsiu's\r\nlines. Although he recognized that its author had yet to grasp his own\r\noriginal nature, Hui-neng asked to be shown the verse and allowed to do\r\nhomage to it. After he was led to the hall, the illiterate lad from the\r\nbarbarian south asked to have a _gatha _of his own inscribed next to\r\nthe one on the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_There is no Bodhi-tree\r\n\r\nNor stand of a mirror bright.\r\n\r\nSince all is void,\r\n\r\nWhere can the dust alight?_4_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAlthough the assembly was electrified by the insight contained in this\r\n_gatha_, the diplomatic old Fifth Patriarch publicly declared that its\r\nauthor lacked full understanding. During the night, however, he\r\nsummoned young Hui-neng to the darkened meditation hall, where he\r\nexpounded the Diamond Sutra to him and then ceremonially passed to him\r\nthe robe of Bodhidharma, symbol of the patriarchy. He also advised him\r\nto travel immediately to the south, to stay underground for a time in\r\nthe interest of safety, and then to preach the Dharma to all who would\r\nlisten. Hui-neng departed that very night, crossing the Yangtze and\r\nheading south--the anointed Sixth Patriarch at age twenty-four.\r\n\r\nWhen the other monks realized what had happened, they hastily organized\r\na party to retrieve Hui-neng and the Ch'an relics. Finally one of the\r\npursuers, a burly former soldier, reached the new Sixth Patriarch in\r\nhis hideaway. Suddenly overcome by the presence of Hui-neng, he found\r\nhimself asking not for the return of the robe but rather for\r\ninstruction. Hui-neng obliged him with, \"Not thinking of good, not\r\nthinking of evil, tell me what was your original face before your\r\nmother and father were born.\" This celebrated question--which dramatizes\r\nthe Zen concept of an original nature in every person that precedes and\r\ntranscends artificial values such as good and evil--caused the pursuer\r\nto be enlightened on the spot.\r\n\r\nFor the next several years Hui-neng sought seclusion, living among\r\nhunters in the south and concealing his identity. The legends say his\r\nkindly nature caused him sometimes to secretly release animals from the\r\nhunters' traps and that he would accept only vegetables from their\r\nstewpots. But this life as an anonymous vagabond, a Patriarch while not\r\neven a priest, could not be his final calling. One day when the time\r\nfelt right (in 676, as he neared forty), he renounced the life of a\r\nrefugee and ventured into Canton to visit the Fa-hsing temple. One\r\nafternoon as he lingered in the guise of an anonymous guest, he\r\noverheard a group of monks arguing about a banner flapping in the\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nOne monk declared, \"The banner is moving.\"\r\n\r\nAnother insisted, \"No, it is the wind that is moving.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he was only a lay observer, Hui-neng could not contain\r\nhimself, and he interrupted them with his dramatic manifesto, \"You are\r\nboth wrong. It is your mind that moves.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot of the temple, standing nearby, was dumbstruck by the\r\nprofound insight of this stranger, and on the spot offered to become\r\nhis pupil. Hui-neng declined the honor, however, requesting instead\r\nthat his head be shaved and he be allowed to enter Buddhist orders, a\r\npriest at last. He was shortly acclaimed by one and all as the Sixth\r\nPatriarch, and after a few months in Canton he decided to move to a\r\ntemple of his own at Ts'ao-ch'i, where he taught for the next four\r\ndecades. From this monastery came the teachings that would define the\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing story, perhaps the most famous in the Zen canon, is drawn\r\nmainly from the aforementioned Platform Sutra of Hui-neng, purportedly\r\nan autobiography and sermon presented to an assembly in his later\r\nyears.5 (The setting was a temple near his monastery, where he was\r\ninvited to lecture one day by the local abbot. It was transcribed by\r\none of his disciples, ince Hui-neng traditionally was said to have been\r\nilliterate.) The document has come down to us in three parts. The first\r\npart is the story just summarized: a poetry contest at the monastery of\r\nthe Fifth Patriarch in which the man later to lead Northern Ch'an is\r\nhumiliated by a bumpkin, who himself must then flee the wrath of the\r\nCh'an establishment and wait for recognition in the south. The second\r\npart is a lecture that scholars believe probably represents the general\r\noutline of Hui-neng's views on man's original nature. The third part is\r\na highly embellished account of his later years, usually dismissed as\r\nthe pious invention of a more recent date.\r\n\r\nThe real life of Hui-neng is a historical puzzle that may well never be\r\nresolved. For example, it is common to note that the later Ch'an\r\nwriters took great pains to render Hui-neng as illiterate and\r\nunlettered as possible, the more to emphasize his egalitarianism. (This\r\nin spite of the fact that the sermon attributed to him refers to at\r\nleast seven different sutras.) The facts were adjusted to make a point:\r\nIf a simple illiterate wood peddler could become Patriarch, what better\r\nproof that the faith is open to all people? Many of the traditional\r\nanecdotes surrounding his early years are similarly suspect, and in\r\nfact the most respected Hui-neng scholar has declared, \"If we consider\r\nall the available material, and eliminate patiently all the\r\ninconsistencies by picking the most likely legends, we can arrive at a\r\nfairly credible biography of Hui-neng. If, on the other hand, we\r\neliminate the legends and the undocumented references to the Sixth\r\nPatriarch, we may conclude that there is, in fact, almost nothing that\r\nwe can really say about him.\"6 Yet does it really matter whether the\r\nlegend is meticulously faithful to the facts? Hui-neng is as much a\r\nsymbol as a historical individual, and it was essential that his life\r\nhave legendary qualities. In his case, art may have helped life along a\r\nbit, but it was for a larger purpose.\r\n\r\nThe purpose was to formalize the new philosophical ideas of Southern\r\nCh'an. The second part of the Platform Sutra, which details his\r\nphilosophical position, has been characterized as a masterpiece of\r\nChinese thought, the work not of a scholar but of a natural sage whose\r\nwisdom flowed spontaneously from deep within. Yet it is commonly\r\nconceded that the uniqueness of his message lies not so much in its\r\nbeing original (which most agree it is not) but in its rendering of the\r\nbasic ideas of Buddhism into Chinese terms.7 Buddhism itself seems at\r\ntimes to be in question, as the Sixth Patriarch discounts traditional\r\nobservances, even\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the Buddhist Western Paradise, known as the Pure Land,\r\nmight be merely a state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The deluded person concentrates on Buddha and wishes to be born in the\r\nother land; the awakened person makes pure his own mind. . . . If only\r\nthe mind has no impurity, the Western Land is not far. If the mind\r\ngives rise to impurities, even though you invoke the Buddha and seek to\r\nbe reborn in the West, it will be difficult to reach . . . but if you\r\npractice straightforward mind, you will arrive there in an instant.8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hui-neng also questioned the traditional Ch'an practice of sitting in\r\nmeditation, declaring it to be more a mind-set than a physical act (if\r\nhis Sutra is authentic, then he predates his pupil Shen-hui on this\r\npoint). He also broke it apart into two different categories: the\r\nsitting and the meditation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_. . . what is this teaching that we call \"sitting in meditation\"? In\r\nthis teaching \"sitting\" means without any obstruction anywhere,\r\noutwardly and under all circumstances, not to activate thoughts.\r\n\"Meditation\" is internally to see the original nature and not become\r\nconfused.9\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nElsewhere he is quoted as declaring that protracted sitting only\r\nshackles the body without profiting the mind.10 Although Hui-neng\r\nseverely took to task those who depended on meditation, there is no\r\nevidence that he forbade it entirely. What he did reject was a fixation\r\non meditation, a confusion--to use a later Zen expression--of the finger\r\npointing at the moon with the moon itself. Even so, this was a radical\r\nmove. Hui-neng presents us with the startling prospect of a _dhyana\r\n_teacher questioning the function of _dhyana_--until then the very basis\r\nof the school.\r\n\r\nYet the sutra is far from being all negative. It has a number of\r\npositive messages, including the following: All people are born in an\r\nenlightened state, a condition in which good and evil are not\r\ndistinguished. Nor are there distracting discriminations, attachments,\r\nand perturbations of the spirit in this primal estate. (A very similar\r\nview is found throughout the poetry of William Wordsworth, to give only\r\none example from Western thought.11) But if man's original nature is\r\npure and unstained, how then does evil enter into a person's character?\r\nHe faces this classic theological question head-on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Good friends, although the nature of people in this world is from the\r\noutset pure in itself, the ten thousand things are all within their own\r\nnatures. If people think of all the evil things, then they will\r\npractice evil; if they think of all the good things, then they will\r\npractice good. Thus it is clear that in this way all the _dharmas\r\n_(aspects of humanity) are within your own natures, yet your own\r\nnatures are always pure. The sun and moon are always bright, yet if\r\nthey are covered by clouds, although they are bright, below they are\r\ndarkened, and the sun, moon, stars, and planets cannot be seen clearly.\r\nBut if suddenly the wind of wisdom should blow and roll away the clouds\r\nand mists, all forms in the universe appear at once. . . . [I]f a\r\nsingle thought of good evolves, intuitive wisdom is born. As one lamp\r\nserves to dispel a thousand years of darkness, so one flash of wisdom\r\ndestroys ten thousand years of ignorance.12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAs Hui-neng viewed it, there is latent within us all the condition of\r\nenlightenment, the state that precedes our concern with good and evil.\r\nIt can be reclaimed through an intuitive acquaintance with our own\r\ninner natures. This is well summarized by the Hui-neng scholar Philip\r\nYampolsky: \"The Platform Sutra maintains that the nature of man is from\r\nthe outset pure, but that his purity has no form. But by self-practice,\r\nby endeavoring for himself, man can gain insight into this purity.\r\nMeditation, _prajna_, true reality, purity, the original nature, self-\r\nnature, the Buddha nature, all these terms, which are used constantly\r\nthroughout the sermon, indicate the same undefined Absolute, which when\r\nseen and experienced by the individual himself, constitutes\r\nenlightenment.\"13\r\n\r\nThis condition of original innocence that is enlightenment can be\r\nreclaimed through \"no-thought,\" a state in which the mind floats,\r\nunattached to what it encounters, moving freely through phenomena,\r\nunperturbed by the incursions and attractions of the world, liberated\r\nbecause it is its own master, tranquil because it is pure. This is the\r\ncondition in which we were born and it is the condition to which we can\r\nreturn by practicing \"no-thought.\" Although it happens to be similar to\r\nthe condition that can be realized through arduous meditation, Hui-neng\r\napparently did not believe that meditation was required. This primal\r\ncondition of the mind, this glimpse into our original nature, could be\r\nrealized instantaneously if our mind were receptive. But what is this\r\nstate called \"no-thought\"? According to Hui-neng:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To be unstained in all environments is called no-thought. If on the\r\nbasis of your own thoughts you separate from environment, then, in\r\nregard to things, thoughts are not produced. If you stop thinking of\r\nthe myriad things, and cast aside all thoughts, as soon as one instant\r\nof thought is cut off, you will be reborn in another realm. . . .\r\nBecause man in his delusion has thoughts in relation to his\r\nenvironment, heterodox ideas stemming from these thoughts arise, and\r\npassions and false views are produced from them.14\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nYampolsky characterizes \"no-thought\" as follows: \"Thoughts are\r\nconceived as advancing in progression from past to present to future,\r\nin an unending chain of successive thoughts. Attachment to one instant\r\nof thought leads to attachment to a succession of thoughts, and thus to\r\nbondage. By cutting off attachment to one instant of thought, one may,\r\nby a process unexplained, cut off attachment to a succession of\r\nthoughts and thus attain to no-thought, which is the state of\r\nenlightenment.\"15 Precisely how this condition of \"no-thought\"\r\nenlightenment is achieved is not explained in the Platform Sutra and in\r\nfact has been the major concern of Zen ever since. The one thing that\r\nall will agree is that the harder one tries to attain it, the more\r\ndifficult it becomes. It is there inside, waiting to be released, but\r\nit can be reached only through the intuitive mind. And it happens\r\nsuddenly, when we least expect.\r\n\r\nThe master Hui-neng stands at the watershed of Zen history. Indeed he\r\nmay be the watershed, in the embodied form of a legend. There seems\r\nreason to suspect that he was canonized well after the fact, as was\r\nBodhidharma. But whereas Bodhidharma provided an anchor for the\r\noriginal formation of a separate _Dhyana_ sect in Chinese Buddhism,\r\nHui-neng became the rallying symbol for a new type of Ch'an, one wholly\r\nChinese, and one that seemed to discount Bodhidharma's old mainstay,\r\nmeditation. He became the Chinese answer to the Indian Bodhidharma.\r\n\r\nHui-neng redefined the specific characteristics of the Ch'an goal and\r\ndescribed in nontheological terms the mind state in which duality is\r\nbanished. But he failed to go the next step and explain how to get\r\nthere. All he did was point out (to use the terminology of logic) that\r\nmeditation not only was not a sufficient condition for enlightenment,\r\nit might not even be a necessary condition. What then was required? The\r\nanswer to this question was to be worked out during the next phase of\r\nCh'an, the so-called Golden Age of Zen, when a new school of Southern\r\nCh'an exploded (to use a common description) in the south and went on\r\nto take over all of Ch'an. These new teachers seem to have accepted\r\nHui-neng as their patron, although the direct connection is not\r\nentirely clear. These masters learned how to impose a torture chamber\r\non the logical mind, bringing to it such humiliations that it finally\r\nannihilated ego or self and surrendered to _prajna_, intuitive wisdom.\r\nThey devised systematic ways to produce the state of \"no-thought\" that\r\nHui-neng and Shen-hui apparently could only invoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE GOLDEN AGE OF ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . . in which teachers of rural, Southern Ch'an begin to experiment\r\nwith new ways to precipitate the \"sudden\" enlightenment experience,\r\neven bringing into question the role of meditation. Along with the\r\nsearch for new techniques goes the attempt to define precisely what\r\nenlightenment is and to formalize the transmission process. During this\r\ntime, Ch'an monasteries become independent organizations and Ch'an a\r\nrecognized, if eccentric, Buddhist sect. The iconoclastic, self-\r\nsupporting Ch'an establishments ride out a persecution of Buddhism in\r\nthe mid-ninth century that effectively destroys all other Buddhist\r\nschools in China. This is the great creative era of Ch'an, in which the\r\nsect secures its own identity and creates its own texts for use by\r\nlater generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Six\r\n\r\nMA-TSU:\r\n\r\nORIGINATOR OF \"SHOCK\" ENLIGHTENMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ma-tsu (right) and Layman P'ang_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Hui-neng was the Sixth Patriarch, then who was the seventh? Although\r\nseveral of his followers are mentioned in the Platform Sutra, the only\r\none who seems to have made any difference in Ch'an history was Shen-hui\r\n(670-762), who successfully destroyed the Northern school of Shen-hsiu\r\n(605-706) and elevated Hui-neng. Although Shen-hui was given the\r\naccolade of Seventh Patriarch in some parts of the north, history was\r\nto be written elsewhere. Shen-hui's school of \"Southern\" Ch'an was soon\r\ncompromising with the remaining Northern Ch'anists--conceding that the\r\nstudy of the sutras could go along hand in hand with sudden\r\nenlightenment--and he seems to have enjoyed a little too much his role\r\nas imperial socialite. The only member of Shen-hui's school to realize\r\nany historical prominence was Tsung-mi (780-841), whose fame attaches\r\nnot to his original thought but rather to his scholarly writings\r\ndescribing the various sects of Ch'an.1 A litterateur and friend of the\r\nfamous poet Po Chu-i (772-846), he also tried unsuccessfully to mediate\r\nbetween the followers of the step-by-step sutra-reading Buddhists of\r\nthe cities and the all-at-once, anti-literary proponents of sudden\r\nenlightenment in the country, but he succeeded only in bringing the\r\nhistory of Northern Ch'an to a dignified close.2\r\n\r\nThe Chinese scholar Hu Shih skillfully pinpoints why the social success\r\nof Shen-hui's new \"Southern\" school in the north actually contributed\r\nto its decline. As he saw it: \"The explanation is simple. Zennism could\r\nnot flourish as an officially patronized religion, but only as an\r\nattitude of mind, a method of thinking and a mode of living. An\r\nofficially patronized teacher of Buddhism is obliged to perform all the\r\ntraditional rituals and ceremonies which the true Zennist despises.\r\nShen-hui succeeded in establishing Zennism as a state religion, but by\r\nso doing he almost killed it. All further development of Chinese Zen\r\nhad to come from those great teachers who valued simple life and\r\nintellectual freedom and independence more than worldly recognition.\"3\r\nAnd in fact just such teachers had begun springing up like mushrooms.\r\nOn lonely mountaintops, teachers of sudden enlightenment were\r\nexperimenting with new ways to transmit wordless insight. They seem to\r\nhave despised traditional Buddhism, perhaps partly because Buddhism--by\r\nwhich is meant the cultural elitists and aristocrats in the capitals of\r\nCh'ang-an and Loyang--had so long despised them. (Recall the Fifth\r\nPatriarch's greeting to Hui-neng: \"If you're from the south, you must\r\nbe a barbarian.\") Although traditional Buddhism (including teachers of\r\n_dhyana_) continued to flourish, and the city of Ch'ang-an remained a\r\nmodel for Asian civilization, the political power of the T'ang\r\ngovernment in the north gradually withered. And as it declined, so too\r\ndid the fortunes of the traditional Ch'an establishments that had\r\nflourished under imperial patronage.\r\n\r\nThe new Ch'an teachers of the Southern school may have felt smug in\r\ntheir new prestige and independence, but they still were subject to the\r\ningrained Chinese desire for a lineage. (Perhaps in the land of\r\nConfucius, spiritual ancestors were essential to dignity.) The triumph\r\nof the legend of Hui-neng in the north had not been lost on the\r\nCh'anists elsewhere, and it effectively meant that for any Ch'an school\r\nto have respectability nationwide, it had to be able to trace its\r\nlineage back to this illiterate southerner and his temple at Ts'ao-\r\nch'i. Unfortunately this turned out to be difficult, since by the time\r\nHui-neng actually came to be recognized as the Sixth Patriarch, he had\r\nbeen dead for half a century and there were few Chinese who even knew\r\nfirsthand of his existence--and none besides Shen-hui who ever claimed\r\nto have studied under him. How then could he be made the founder of the\r\nCh'an schools blooming all over China?\r\n\r\nThe scholar Hu Shih has speculated somewhat knavishly on how Hui-neng's\r\n\"lineage\" may have been created after the fact: \"By the last quarter of\r\nthe eighth century, there began to be a great stampede of almost all\r\nthe Ch'an schools to get on the bandwagon of the school of Hui-neng. .\r\n. . Hui-neng died early in the eighth century, and his disciples were\r\nmostly unknown ascetics who lived and died in their hilly retreats. One\r\ncould easily have paid a visit to some of them. So in the last decades\r\nof the century, some of those unknown names were remembered or\r\ndiscovered. Two of the names thus exhumed from obscurity were Huai-jang\r\nof the Heng Mountains in Hunan, and Hsing-ssu of the Ch'ing-yuan\r\nMountains of Kiangsi. Neither of these names appeared in earlier\r\nversions of Hui-neng's life story.\"4\r\n\r\nThese two masters, Nan-yueh Huai-jang (677-744) of Hunan and Ch'ing-\r\nyuan Hsing-ssu (d. 740) of Kiangsi, were made the missing links between\r\nHui-neng and the two schools of Ch'an that would one day become\r\nJapanese Rinzai and Soto, respectively. Since the lineage most\r\nimportant for the early years of Ch'an's Golden Age was that which\r\nwould one day be the Rinzai school, the tradition of Huai-jang will be\r\nexamined here first. As noted above, although the legend says that\r\nHuai-jang once studied under the Sixth Patriarch, Hui-neng, supporting\r\nhistorical evidence is not readily found. However, he is thought to\r\nhave studied under another follower of the Fifth Patriarch Hung-jen and\r\nto have been a part of the general scene of Southern Ch'an.5 His actual\r\nfunction may have been to supply a direct line of descent between Hui-\r\nneng and the man who was to be the creator of Rinzai Zen as we know it\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nThat man is the famous Ma-tsu Tao-i (709-788), who even if not a direct\r\nspiritual descendant of Hui-neng was certainly a product of the same\r\nexciting period of intellectual ferment. According to the more or less\r\ncontemporary record left by the northern historian Tsung-mi, Ma-tsu\r\n(which means \"Patriarch Ma\") was a native of Szechuan who was ordained\r\na monk at an early age by a Korean master in his home province.6 Young\r\nMa traveled on, as was common with beginning Ch'an monks, and (so say\r\nthe later legends) finally came to the monastery of Huai-jang, located\r\non Mt. Nan-yueh. The story of their first encounter became a standard\r\namong later Ch'an masters, for it is a particularly effective\r\ndiscrediting of that onetime Ch'an mainstay, meditation, which became\r\nanathema to the more revolutionary Southern school.\r\n\r\nAs the story goes, Huai-jang one day came upon Ma-tsu absorbed in\r\nmeditation and proceeded to question the purpose of his long bouts of\r\n_dhyana_. Ma-tsu immediately replied, \"I want to become a Buddha, an\r\nenlightened being.\"\r\n\r\nSaying nothing, Huai-jang quietly picked up a brick and started rubbing\r\nit on a stone. After a time Ma-tsu's curiosity bested him and he\r\ninquired, \"Why are you rubbing that brick on a stone?\"\r\n\r\nHuai-jang replied, \"I am polishing it into a mirror.\"\r\n\r\nMa-tsu probably knew by this time that he had been set up, but he had\r\nto follow through: \"But how can you make a mirror by polishing a brick\r\non a stone?\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrated answer was: \"How can you become enlightened by sitting\r\nin meditation?\"\r\n\r\nThe point, driven home time and again throughout the eighth century,\r\nwas that enlightenment is an active, not a passive, condition. And Ma-\r\ntsu himself was to become the foremost exponent of enlightenment as a\r\nnatural part of life.\r\n\r\nMa-tsu always made a profound impression on his contemporaries, and no\r\nsmall part may be attributable to his peculiar physical traits. As _The\r\nTransmission of the Lamp _describes him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In appearance and bearing he was most striking. He glared as a tiger\r\ndoes and he ambled like a cow. He could touch his nose with his tongue,\r\nand on the soles of his feet were wheel-shaped marks [physical\r\nqualities also attributed to the Buddha]. During the period [of 713-41]\r\nhe studied the dhyana . . . under Master Huai-jang, who then had nine\r\ndisciples. Of these only [Ma-tsu] received the sacred mind seal.7\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHowever, his real immortality derives from his contribution to the\r\narsenal of methods for shocking novices into enlightenment. It will be\r\nrecalled that the legendary Sixth Patriarch, Hui-neng, neglected to\r\nexplain exactly what a person should do to \"see into one's own nature.\"\r\nMa-tsu apparently was the first master who developed non-meditative\r\ntricks for nudging a disciple into the state of \"no-thought.\" He was an\r\nexperimenter, and he pioneered a number of methods that later were\r\nperfected by his followers and the descendants of his followers. He was\r\nthe first master to ask a novice an unanswerable question, and then\r\nwhile the person struggled for an answer, to shout in his ear (he liked\r\nthe syllable \"Ho!\")--hoping to jolt the pupil into a non-dualistic mind\r\nstate. Another similar technique was to call out someone's name just as\r\nthe person was leaving the room, a surprise that seemed to bring the\r\nperson up short and cause him to suddenly experience his original\r\nnature. A similar device was to deliver the student a sharp blow as he\r\npondered a point, using violence to focus his attention completely on\r\nreality and abort ratiocination. Other tricks included responding to a\r\nquestion with a seemingly irrelevant answer, causing the student to\r\nsense the irrelevancy of his question. He would also sometimes send a\r\npupil on a \"goose chase\" between himself and some other enlightened\r\nindividual at the monastery, perhaps in the hope that bouncing the\r\nnovice from one personality to another would somehow shake his\r\ncomplacency. Whatever the technique, his goal was always to force a\r\nnovice to uncover his original nature for himself. He did this by never\r\ngiving a straight answer or a predictable response and therefore never\r\nallowing a disciple to lapse into a passive mental mode.\r\n\r\nMa-tsu also seems to have simplified the idea of what constitutes\r\nenlightenment. As he defined it, \"seeing into one's own nature\" simply\r\nmeant understanding (intuitively, not rationally) who you are and what\r\nyou are. This truth could be taught with whatever method seemed\r\nappropriate at a given moment. As Hu Shih so eloquently describes his\r\nteaching,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ \". . . any gesture or motion, or even silence, might be used to\r\ncommunicate a truth. [Recall the Buddha once enlightened a follower by\r\nholding up a flower.] Ma-tsu developed this idea into a pedagogical\r\nmethod for the new Zen. There is no need to seek any special faculty in\r\nthe mind for the enlightenment. Every behavior is the mind, the\r\nmanifestation of the Buddha-nature. Snapping a finger, frowning or\r\nstretching the brow, coughing, smiling, anger, sorrow, or desire . . .\r\nis the functioning of the Buddhahead: it is the Tao, the Way. There is\r\nno need to perform any special act, be it dhyana_ _or worship, in order\r\nto achieve the Tao. To be natural is the Way. Walk naturally, sit\r\nnaturally, sleep naturally, live naturally--that is the Way. Let the\r\nmind be free: do not purposely do evil; nor purposely do good. There is\r\nno Law to abide, no Buddhahood to attain. Maintain a free mind and\r\ncling to nothing: that is Tao._\"8_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThus it seems that the most preeminent Ch'an master of the eighth\r\ncentury not only repudiated all the apparatus of traditional Buddhism,\r\nhe also simplified enlightenment down to a quite secular condition of\r\nacceptance of the natural state of human affairs. For instance,\r\nalthough he was familiar with the great Mahayana sutras, Ma-tsu never\r\nmentions Hui-neng or the Diamond Sutra. His Ch'an, expressed in simple\r\neveryday language, seems merely so many ways of finding out who you are\r\nand what you are. Furthermore, there seems to be nothing specifically\r\nthat you can do to accelerate the occurrence of sudden enlightenment,\r\nother than use traditional practices to make your psyche as\r\nuncomplicated as possible and then wait for the moment to strike (he,\r\nof course, experimented to find ways to accelerate the arrival of that\r\nmoment). But he has nothing encouraging to say about the effectiveness\r\nof meditation as an aid to finding the desired non-rational insight,\r\nwhich he sometimes described using the borrowed term \"Tao\":\r\n\r\n_Cultivation is of no use for the attainment of Tao. The only\r\n\r\nthing that one can do is to be free of defilement. When one's\r\n\r\nmind is stained with thoughts of life and death, or deliberate action,\r\nthat is defilement. The grasping of the Truth is the function of\r\neveryday-mindedness. Everyday-mindedness is free from intentional\r\naction, free from concepts of right and wrong, taking and giving, the\r\nfinite or the infinite. . . . All our daily activities--walking,\r\nstanding, sitting, lying down--all response to situations, our dealings\r\nwith circumstances as they arise: all this is Tao.9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ma-tsu eventually left Huai-jang (if, in fact, he ever met him in the\r\nfirst place) and presided over a community of Ch'an disciples at K'ai-\r\nyuan temple in Kiangsi. This was to be the incubator for the greatest\r\nthinkers of the eighth century, and the setting for some of the finest\r\nCh'an anecdotes. The anecdote, incidentally, is the perfect Ch'an\r\nteaching device, since it forces the listener to find its meaning in\r\nhis own inner experience. The sermon provided the theoretical basis for\r\nan idea, but the anecdote showed the theory in action and made the\r\nlistener share in a real experience, if only vicariously. But first we\r\nwill begin with a sermon credited to him, in which he summarizes the\r\nphilosophical position he held. There was nothing particularly new\r\nabout his understanding; it was his method that was novel. His sermon\r\nsaid, in essence, that reality is merely our mind, and that\r\nenlightenment comprised the nonrational recognition of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_All of you should realize that your own mind is Buddha, that is, this\r\nmind is Buddha's Mind. . . . Those who seek for the Truth should\r\nrealize that there is nothing to seek. There is no Buddha but Mind;\r\nthere is no Mind but Buddha.10\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAgain there is the counsel against discriminations between good and\r\nevil, since the original Mind transcends these:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do not choose what is good, nor reject what is evil, but rather be\r\nfree from purity and defilement. Then you will realize the emptiness of\r\nsin.11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_This is not a preachment of values; rather it is the insight that\r\nthere is a reality beyond our puny discriminations. If you can achieve\r\nthis larger perspective, then good and evil become an inconsequential\r\npart of the larger flow of life.\r\n\r\nHis sermon then returns to the theme of the mind as the arbiter of\r\nreality, recalling the Void of Nagarjuna and pointing out that even the\r\nworkings of the mind are ephemeral and possess no self-nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thoughts perpetually change and cannot be grasped because they possess\r\nno self-nature. The Triple World [of desire, form, and beyond-form] is\r\nnothing more than one's mind. The multitudinous universe is nothing but\r\nthe testimony of one Dharma [truth]. What are seen as forms are the\r\nreflections of the mind. The mind does not exist by itself; its\r\nexistence is manifested through forms. . . . If you are aware of this\r\nmind, you will dress, eat, and act spontaneously in life as it\r\ntranspires, and thereby cultivate your spiritual nature. There is\r\nnothing more that I can teach you.12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe essence of this teaching is that reality is, for us, merely what\r\nour mind says it is, and \"enlightenment\" or \"becoming a Buddha\" is\r\nmerely coming to terms with ourselves and with this tricky mind that\r\nconstantly devises our reality for us.\r\n\r\nThis credo is remembered most vividly in two anecdotes that were later\r\nenshrined in a famous collection of koans called the Wu-men Kuan (or\r\nMumonkan in Japanese). In both of these anecdotes, Ma-tsu is asked,\r\n\"What is Buddha?\"--meaning what is the spirituality that all seek. In\r\none he replied, \"Mind is Buddha\" (Mumonkan, Case 30), and in the other\r\nanecdote he said, \"No mind, no Buddha\" (Mumonkan, Case 33), which\r\nmerely affirms that spirituality is in the mind, and for its\r\nrealization one must realize the mind.13 In either instance he is merely\r\nfollowing the earlier idea that there is no reality and thus no\r\nenlightenment outside the mind.\r\n\r\nThese two exchanges are part of a single anecdote of Ma-tsu recorded in\r\nthe chronicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk asked why the Master maintained, \"The Mind is the Buddha.\" The\r\nMaster answered, \"Because I want to stop the crying of a baby.\" The\r\nmonk persisted, \"When the crying has stopped, what is it then?\" \"Not\r\nMind, not Buddha,\" was the answer. \"How do you teach a man who does not\r\nuphold either of these?\" The Master said, \"I would tell him, 'Not\r\nthings.' \" The monk again questioned, \"If you met a man free from\r\nattachment to all things, what would you tell him?\" The Master replied,\r\n\"I would let him experience the Great Tao._\"14_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_As the scholar John Wu has pointed out, \"This dialogue reveals an\r\nimportant secret about Ma-tsu's art of teaching. Sometimes he used a\r\npositive formula, sometimes he used a negative formula. On the surface\r\nthey are contradictory to each other. But when we remember that he was\r\nusing them in answering persons of different grades of attainments and\r\nintelligence, the contradiction disappears at once in the light of a\r\nhigher unity of purpose, which was in all cases to lead the questioner\r\nto transcend his present state.\"15 Another example of a seemingly\r\ncontradictory position is recorded as a koan in another famous\r\ncollection, the Blue Cliff Record (Case 3). In this anecdote, Ma-tsu is\r\nasked one day about his health, and he responded with, \"Sun-faced\r\nBuddhas, Moon-faced Buddhas.\"16 According to a Buddhist tradition, a\r\nSun-faced Buddha lives for eighteen hundred years, a Moon-faced Buddha\r\nlives only a day and a night. Perhaps he was proposing these two\r\ncontradictory cases to demonstrate the irrelevance of an inquiry after\r\nhis physical state. It would have been far better if the question had\r\nconcerned his mind.\r\n\r\nA story describing how Ma-tsu handled other teachers who wandered by\r\ndepicts very well the way that he could undermine logic and\r\ncategorization. In a particularly famous anecdote, a visiting teacher\r\nproposed a condition of duality, a condition equivalent to that of a\r\nswitch that can be either off or on. Having permitted the teacher to\r\nadopt this very un-Zen position, Ma-tsu proceeds to demolish him. The\r\nstory goes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk who lectured on Buddhism came to the Master and asked, \"What is\r\nthe teaching advocated by the Ch'an masters?\" Ma-tsu posed a\r\ncounterquestion: \"What teachings do you maintain?\" The monk replied\r\nthat he had lectured on more than twenty sutras and sastras. The Master\r\nexclaimed, \"Are you not a lion?\" The monk said, \"I do not venture to\r\nsay that.\" The Master puffed twice and the monk commented, \"This is the\r\nway to teach Ch'an.\" Ma-tsu retorted, \"What way do you mean?\" and the\r\nmonk said, \"The way the lion leaves the den.\" The Master became silent.\r\nImmediately the monk remarked, \"This is also the way of Ch'an\r\nteaching.\" At this the Master again asked, \"What way do you mean?\" \"The\r\nlion remains in his den.\" \"When there is neither going out nor\r\nremaining in, what way would you say this was?\" The monk made no\r\nanswer. . . .17\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nMa-tsu had posed a seemingly unanswerable question, at least a question\r\nthat logic could not answer. This provocative exchange, later to be\r\nknown as a mondo, was a new teaching technique that departed\r\nsignificantly from the earlier methods of Hui-neng and Shen-hui, who\r\nmounted a platform, gave a sermon, and then politely received questions\r\nfrom the audience.\r\n\r\nBut how did Ma-tsu handle this question when it was presented to him?\r\nHe fell back on the fact that reality is what we make it, and all\r\nthings return to the mind. He once handled essentially the same\r\nquestion that he put to the visiting monk, showing how it can be done.\r\nHis response is the essence of Zen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk once drew four lines in front of Ma-tsu. The top line was long\r\nand the remaining three were short. He then demanded of the Master,\r\n\"Besides saying that one line is long and the other three are short,\r\nwhat else could you say?\" Ma-tsu drew one line on the ground and said,\r\n\"This could be called either long or short. That is my answer._\"18_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Language is deceptive. But if it is used to construct an anti-logical\r\nquestion, it can equally be used to construct an anti-logical reply.\r\n\r\nMa-tsu discovered and refined what seems to have eluded the earlier\r\nteachers such as Hui-neng and Huai-jang: namely, the trigger mechanism\r\nfor sudden enlightenment. As noted earlier, he originated the use of\r\nshouting and blows to precipitate enlightenment, techniques to become\r\ncelebrated in later decades in the hands of men such as Huang-po and\r\nLin-chi, masters who shaped the Rinzai sect. As a typical example,\r\nthere is the story of a monk coming to him to ask, \"What was the\r\npurpose of Bodhidharma's coming from the West?\" which is Ch'an parlance\r\nfor \"What is the basic principle of Zen?\" As the monk bowed reverently\r\nbefore the old master waiting for the reply that would bring it all\r\ntogether, Ma-tsu knocked him to the ground, saying, \"If I do not strike\r\nyou, people all over the country will laugh at me.\" The hapless monk\r\npicked himself up off the ground and--suddenly realizing he had just\r\ntasted the only reality there is--was enlightened on the spot.19\r\nObviously, every boxer does not experience enlightenment when he\r\nreceives a knockout punch. The blow of enlightenment is meant to rattle\r\nthe questioning mind and to disrupt, if only for an instant, its\r\nclinging to abstractions and logic. It seems almost as though\r\nenlightenment were a physical phenomenon that sometimes can best be\r\nachieved by a physical process--such as a blow or a shout.\r\n\r\nThe violence seemed to work both ways, for the monks often gave him a\r\ndose of his own medicine. An example is reported in the following\r\nstory:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_It happened once that his disciple Yin-feng was pushing along a cart,\r\nwhile Ma-tsu was sitting on the road with his feet stretched out. Yin-\r\nfeng requested him to draw back his feet, but Ma-tsu said, \"What is\r\nstretched out is not to be drawn back again!\" Yin-feng retorted, \"Once\r\nadvanced, there is no turning backward!'' Disregarding the master, he\r\nkept pushing the cart until it ran over and injured his feet. Ma-tsu\r\nreturned to the hall with an axe in his hand, saying, \"Let the one who\r\na few moments ago injured my feet with his cart come forward!\" Yin-\r\nfeng, not to be daunted, came forward stretching his neck in front of\r\nthe master. The master [peacefully] put down his axe.20\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe significance of this story, if it has any significance, is that it\r\nconveys the atmosphere of Ch'an monasteries around 750. It demonstrates\r\nthat the leader of a monastery had to win his spurs. He had to be\r\ntougher, more audacious, and faster than anybody else.\r\n\r\nDuring the T'ang it was common to use the ox as a metaphor for all that\r\nis uncontrollable in human nature. The ox was not necessarily bad; it\r\njust had to be governed. The rigor with which this control was applied\r\nat Ma-tsu's monastery is illustrated in the story concerning one of the\r\ndisciples, a former hunter who Ma-tsu encountered one day working in\r\nthe monastery kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asked the master--a question that never got a\r\nstraight answer from an enlightened Ch'an monk.\r\n\r\n\"I am herding an ox,\" the man replied, a metaphorical way of saying he\r\nwas trying to discipline himself. \"And how,\" shot back Ma-tsu, \"do you\r\ngo about tending it?\" The monk replied, \"Whenever it starts to go to\r\ngrass [i.e., self-indulgence], I yank it back by the nostrils [the\r\ntender part of the great animal].\"\r\n\r\nTo which Ma-tsu admiringly replied, \"If you really can do that by\r\nyourself, then I may as well retire.\"21\r\n\r\nThis story illustrates the emphasis on self-control that was a part of\r\nthe Ch'an monasteries. Yet self-control was only to be practiced for\r\nwhat it gave in return. There were no value judgments or rules that had\r\nto be followed. The point was to do what seemed the most rewarding. For\r\nexample, there is a story that a local governor asked Ma-tsu, \"Master,\r\nshould I eat meat and drink wine?\" The master did not give him a reply\r\nthat implied a value judgment, but rather outlined the rewards of the\r\ntwo possible paths: \"To eat and drink is your natural right, to abstain\r\nfrom meat and wine is your chance for greater blessedness.\"22\r\n\r\nMa-tsu often used the structure of language, with its natural capacity\r\nfor parallels, as a teaching tool in itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Another time a monk asked, what is the meaning of Bodhidharma coming\r\nfrom the West?\" \"What is the meaning [of your asking] at this moment?\"\r\nreplied the Master.23\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe monk was interested in abstract issues (using the Ch'an metaphor\r\nfor enlightenment's meaning); Ma-tsu reminded him that the only reality\r\nthat mattered was his own being, his own needs. And he did it using\r\nalmost identical language.\r\n\r\nMa-tsu was constantly testing his disciples, keeping them on their toes\r\nand reinforcing their enlightenment. There is the story that one\r\nevening while enjoying the moonlight with three of his disciples\r\n(including the two most famous, Huai-hai and Nan- ch'uan), he asked\r\nthem the question \"what should we do right now, this very moment?\"--a\r\ntypical Zen challenge. One of the monks said, \"It would be best to be\r\nstudying the sutras of the ancients who have achieved enlightenment.\"\r\nThe monk Huai-hai, who was later to receive Ma-tsu's mantle, countered,\r\n\"It would be good to practice meditation.\"\r\n\r\nAt that point Nan-ch'uan, the third monk, simply rose, shook the\r\nsleeves of his robe, and silently walked away. Ma-tsu acknowledged this\r\nas the right answer and declared, \"The sutra scriptures are returnable\r\nto the Buddhist canon, and meditation to the undifferentiated ocean,\r\nbut Nan-ch'uan alone leaps over and transcends these.\"24 Nan-ch'uan's\r\nresponse was a triumph of physical action and simplicity over\r\nreligiosity and abstraction.\r\n\r\nMa-tsu is reported in the chronicles to have had 139 enlightened\r\ndisciples, many of whom went on to become Ch'an leaders in their own\r\ndistricts. The most outstanding were the monks Huai-hai and Nan-ch'uan\r\nand a layman named P'ang--all three of whom are today remembered in\r\nanecdotes that have become Ch'an scriptures. But others were probably\r\njust as active and enlightened. Southern Ch'an was expanding, with\r\nmountaintop retreats blossoming everywhere. Many teachers probably have\r\nbeen forgotten only because they had no disciples who took the pains to\r\ntranscribe and preserve their teachings. Ma-tsu himself also apparently\r\nwrote nothing, but he was more fortunate in his disciples. In any case,\r\nhe reportedly died in the typical Ch'an way. He predicted his death a\r\nmonth in advance, and when the time came, he bathed, assumed the\r\nmeditation posture, and silently passed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Seven\r\n\r\nHUAI-HAI:\r\n\r\nFATHER OF MONASTIC CH'AN\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many celebrated disciples of Ma-tsu, the man whose influence\r\nhas been most pervasive throughout the succeeding centuries was Po-\r\nchang Huai-hai (720-814). He is the master credited with founding the\r\nfirst wholly Ch'an monastery, with devising a special set of rules for\r\nCh'an discipline, and with writing a closely argued treatise on sudden\r\nenlightenment. Whereas Ma-tsu and others of his disciples such as Nan-\r\nch'uan experimented with ways to help novices break through the barrier\r\nof reason, Huai-hai examined the phenomenon of enlightenment itself and\r\ndescribed the mental state of preparedness necessary to reach the Other\r\nShore. Huai-hai has been somewhat unjustifiably neglected by the modern\r\nZen movement, perhaps because his expository style did not lend itself\r\nto memorable anecdotes or koan cases.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of Huai-hai's origin are contradictory, but he seems to\r\nhave begun his Buddhist studies early, becoming the pupil of a master\r\nnamed Tao-chih in a small town in the present-day province of Chekiang.1\r\n(It was this master who gave him the religious name Huai-hai, or \"Ocean\r\nof Wisdom.\") After he came to maturity, the story goes, he heard of the\r\ngreat master Ma-tsu in the province of Kiangsi, and he traveled there\r\nto study.\r\n\r\nAmong the many anecdotes surrounding Huai-hai's stay with Ma-tsu,\r\nperhaps the finest is that of the auspicious first encounter. The story\r\nsays that when Huai-hai arrived, the old master immediately asked what\r\nprevious temple he had traveled from, followed by: \"What do you come\r\nhere to find?\"\r\n\r\nHuai-hai replied, \"I have come to discover the truth of Buddha.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Ma-tsu replied, \"What can you expect to learn from me? Why do\r\nyou ignore the treasure in your own house and wander so far abroad?\"\r\n\r\nUnderstandably puzzled, Huai-hai asked, \"What is this treasure that I\r\nhave been ignoring?\"\r\n\r\nTo which came the celebrated reply: \"The one who questions me at this\r\nmoment is your treasure. Everything is complete in it. It is lacking in\r\nnothing, and furthermore the things it possesses are inexhaustible.\r\nConsidering that you can use this treasure freely, why then do you\r\npersist in wandering abroad?\" It is said that with these words Huai-hai\r\nsuddenly had an intuitive, non-rational acquaintance with his own mind.2\r\n\r\nAmong the other classic tales of Huai-hai's apprenticeship under Ma-tsu\r\nis the often repeated account of the day the two of them were walking\r\ntogether along a path when suddenly a flock of migratory geese was\r\nheard passing overhead. Ma-tsu turned to his pupil and asked, \"What was\r\nthat sound?\" Huai-hai innocently replied, \"It was the cry of wild\r\ngeese.\" Ma-tsu paused and then demanded of his pupil, \"Where have they\r\ngone?\" Huai-hai said, \"They have flown away.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an unacceptably drab, straightforward answer for a Zen man,\r\nand in disgust Ma-tsu whirled, grabbed Huai-hai's nose, and twisted it\r\nuntil his disciple cried out in panic, causing Ma-tsu to observe, \"So\r\nyou thought they had flown away. Yet they were here all the time.\"3\r\n\r\nThe legends say that this exchange, in the typical harsh style of Ma-\r\ntsu, caused Huai-hai to confront his original nature. What Ma-tsu had\r\ndone was to give his pupil a vivid lesson in the concept of an\r\nindivisible unity which pervades the world; things do not come and go--\r\nthey are there always, part of a permanent fabric. Huai-hai was being\r\ninvited to stop viewing the world as a fragmented collection of\r\nelements and see it rather as a unified whole.\r\n\r\nThe interactions of master and novice were always dynamic. For example,\r\nanother story says that one day Ma-tsu asked Huai-hai how he would\r\nteach Ch'an. Huai-hai responded by holding up a dust whisk vertically.\r\nMa-tsu continued by asking him, \"Is this all there is? Is there nothing\r\nmore?\" Huai-hai replied by throwing down the whisk. (One interpreter\r\nhas said that raising the dust whisk revealed the mind's function,\r\nwhereas throwing it down returned function to the mind's substance.)4\r\nAccording to some versions of this episode, Ma-tsu responded by\r\nshouting at the top of his lungs, rendering Huai-hai deaf for three\r\ndays. This shout is said to have been the occasion of Huai-hai's final\r\nenlightenment.\r\n\r\nHuai-hai seems to have been a kindly man, warm and personable, not\r\ngiven to the roughhouse methods of some of his contemporaries. Instead\r\nof flamboyance, we find a friendly type who concentrated on guiding a\r\ncommunity of disciples (sometimes called a \"Zen forest\") and giving a\r\nhelping hand to all. We will pass over the many other anecdotes\r\ninvolving his stay with Ma-tsu and turn instead to his more significant\r\ncontributions to the growth of Ch'an.5 These fall into two major\r\ncategories: First, he founded the first wholly Ch'an monastery and for\r\nit formulated a set of monastic rules that are today still respected in\r\nZen monasteries; and second, he was one of the first Southern Ch'an\r\nmasters to explore the psychology of \"sudden enlightenment\" and to\r\nwrite a lucid analysis of the mental preparation it required.\r\n\r\nBefore detailing Huai-hai's contribution to monastic Ch'an, perhaps it\r\nwould be well to recall briefly the character of the traditional\r\nBuddhist monastery in China during the T'ang (618-907) era. Buddhist\r\nmonasteries had long been governed by a set of rules known as the\r\n_vinaya_. These rules prescribed everything from the color of the robes\r\nfor the priesthood to the penalties attached to eating onions or garlic\r\n(forbidden primarily because they were thought to be stimulants, not\r\nnecessarily because of their social liabilities in close quarters).\r\nThere were also some specific and quite solemn commandments--for\r\nexample, monks or nuns could be expelled from the community for\r\nstealing, killing, lying, or sexual congress. Originating in India,\r\nthese rules had been subsequently transplanted to China, where they\r\ngradually were made even more strict, although their enforcement\r\napparently was not always rigorous. Perhaps because of this laxity the\r\nT'ang regime established penalties even more severe than those imposed\r\nby the Buddhist authorities. For example, whereas the _vinaya_\r\nindirectly countenanced the eating of meat (through the loophole that\r\nall charitable gifts must be accepted since they give the laity merit,\r\nand if a gift happened to be meat it still had to be consumed for the\r\nsake of the donor), the T'ang government prescribed thirty days of hard\r\nlabor for monks caught partaking. Since citizens entering Buddhist\r\norders were taken off the tax rolls, the government took pains to\r\nensure that monastic life was rigorous enough to discourage simple tax\r\ndodgers.7 Although the Chinese Buddhist schools were almost all members\r\nof the side of Buddhism known as Mahayana, they apparently followed the\r\nrules of Theravada Buddhism, since the latter were clearer and more\r\neasily understood.8 Huai-hai decided to merge the two sets of rules and\r\nfrom them to devise a new set of guidelines specifically for Ch'an,\r\nthereby creating a code of monastic discipline that eventually would\r\nrule Zen behavior throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe record concerning how the Ch'an monastic system initially was\r\nestablished is less detailed than we might wish. The legendary Fourth\r\nPatriarch, Tao-hsin, was said to have been the first _dhyana_ master to\r\nsettle down in one place and nurture a band of disciples. _Dhyana_\r\nteachers seem to have allied themselves with the conventional Buddhists\r\nin the decades that followed, living in their monasteries much as the\r\nhermit crab finds a home in the shells of other species. If their\r\nnumbers were large they might have their own separate quarters, but\r\nthey still had to respect the rules of their host sect, which more\r\noften than not was the Vinaya school.9 Gradually, however, a\r\ntransformation occurred, as Ch'an masters became increasingly\r\ndistinguishable from the leaders of other sects and Ch'an itself grew\r\nto increasing proportions, particularly in the south.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the man who made monastic Ch'an a reality was\r\nMa-tsu's pupil Po-chang Huai-hai. In the recorded anecdotes Huai-hai is\r\ncharacterized as a level-headed, pragmatic man whom one can easily\r\nimagine having superior administrative ability. As John Wu\r\ncharacterizes his rules, \"It was this rule [of Huai-hai] that\r\ninstituted for the first time the Zen monastic system. In its emphasis\r\non moral discipline and its matter of factness, it is comparable to the\r\nHoly Rule of St. Benedict. The duties of the Abbot and various\r\nfunctionaries under him are meticulously defined. The daily life of the\r\nmonks is regulated in detail. Of particular interest are the rites of\r\ntaking vows and the universal duty of working in the fields.\"10\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say exactly what was the nature of the rules Huai-\r\nhai formulated, since his original precepts have been recast a number\r\nof times down through the years, with the earliest surviving version\r\nbeing that preserved in a 1282 Chinese Yuan Dynasty document called\r\n\"the Holy Rule of Po-chang [Huai-hai].\" If we look beyond the details,\r\nhowever, we see that his emphasis on the creation of a self-supporting\r\nmonastic establishment was in a sense a further sinicization of Indian\r\nBuddhism, through the rejection of begging as the primary means of\r\nsupport. (Begging was not abandoned entirely, since it is valuable for\r\nteaching humility; instead it was retained in a regulated, symbolic\r\nform, but made a second line of economic defense.) The monasteries were\r\nintended to survive on their own, since Huai-hai insisted that\r\nmeditation and worship be integrated with physical labor. Whereas the\r\nideal Indian holy man was one who relied on begging, Huai-hai believed\r\nthat in China it was holier to work for a living. This was the core of\r\nhis teachings, as symbolized in his famous manifesto: \"A day without\r\nwork is a day without food.\" Nothing could have been more\r\nsympathetically received among the Chinese, and Huai-hai is probably\r\nrightly credited with inoculating Ch'an against the governmental\r\npersecution of 845 that destroyed so many other Buddhist sects. He\r\npracticed what he preached, and even when he reached old age he\r\ncontinued to toil in the fields. In fact, his disciples finally became\r\nso concerned for his health that they took the unprecedented step of\r\nhiding his gardening hoe. But true to his rule, he refused to eat until\r\nit was returned.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can infer something of Huai-hai's regulations from the\r\nroutine in contemporary Zen monasteries (of the Rinzai sect).11 Monks\r\nrise well before light (before they can see the lines in the palm of\r\ntheir hand), and after their morning toilet they gather in the main\r\nhall for sunrise devotions--in this case rapid chanting of scriptures, a\r\ndevice more for developing powers of concentration than for piety. They\r\nthen return to the meditation hall, where chanting resumes. Next comes\r\nbreakfast, usually plain rice with a modest vegetable garnish, and then\r\nback to the meditation hall for ceremonial tea and announcements of the\r\nday's schedule. Afterward each monk meets individually with the master\r\nin his quarters, where the monk's enlightenment is tested and a koan\r\nmay be assigned. (The master, incidentally, enjoys a private room; the\r\nmonks sleep together in a common hall, arranged according to rank.)\r\nAfter this, the monks attend to the garden and grounds of the\r\nmonastery, and later in the morning there may be begging or visits to\r\nlay patrons for donations. After lunch (the main meal; its leftovers\r\nare supper) there is more work in the garden of the monastery, planting\r\nand harvesting, as well as repairing the buildings or other maintenance\r\nchores. Later on there may be more chanting, as well as cleaning and\r\nupkeep of the interior of the buildings. And in between there may be\r\nmeditation. Then as nightfall descends the evening bell rings out to\r\nsignify the work day's ending. During the evening the monk may meditate\r\nmore or receive further instruction from the master or his brothers.\r\nFinally, late in the evening, to bed--at the end of a long day. It\r\nshould be noted that there are also many special days on which meals,\r\nceremonies, or activities may assume a different character.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the monasteries of early Ch'an are said not to\r\nhave had a Buddha hall or a place for worship; rather they had only a\r\nDharma or lecture hall, in which the master gave a talk, followed by\r\nsharp exchanges with his disciples, who often were rowdy and sometimes\r\nleft at will to demonstrate their independence of mind. These were\r\nplaces of irreverence and unfettered intellectual inquiry; and\r\napparently there was no enforced study of the traditional Buddhist\r\nliterature. With monasteries of their own where they could do as they\r\npleased, the Ch'an masters found their rebellion complete. Theirs now\r\nwas an unhampered search for the perennial philosophy.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind we may now turn to the psychological teachings of the\r\nlawgiver Huai-hai. Unlike the piecemeal story of his contribution to\r\nmonastic life, which is preserved in spirit more than in letter, the\r\nwritings on enlightenment that bear his name are rather firmly\r\nattributed. This is, in fact, a significant new aspect of Ch'an\r\nhistory, since his work represents one of the oldest documents actually\r\ncomposed by a master--as compared to a sermon transcribed and edited by\r\nsome follower. According to the extant writings, after Huai-hai had\r\nstudied with Ma-tsu for several years, he returned to his home temple\r\nto care for his first master, Tao-chih, who was by then aged and ill--an\r\nact of duty any Chinese would immediately understand. It was during\r\nthis return visit with his old master that he composed a treatise\r\nsetting forth the theoretical basis of sudden enlightenment. It is said\r\nthat when this document was shown to Ma-tsu, he compared Huai-hai to a\r\ngreat pearl whose luster penetrated all time and space. (Curiously, Ma-\r\ntsu himself appears not to have made a great fuss about the meaning of\r\nsudden enlightenment, seemingly taking the \"theory\" for granted and\r\nmoving along to the \"practice.\")\r\n\r\n\"The Zen Teaching of Huai-hai on Sudden Illumination\" was\r\n\r\ncomposed in the form of an imaginary question-and-answer session, in\r\nwhich Huai-hai effectively interviewed himself on the question of\r\nsudden enlightenment and the specific problems a person might encounter\r\nin trying to prepare for it. He stressed that one of the most important\r\nthings to do was to suspend making value judgments about things, since\r\nthis leads almost directly to splitting things into camps of good and\r\nbad, likes and dislikes. This opens one to the world of categories and\r\ndualities, just the opposite from oneness. According to Huai-hai, the\r\nfirst thing to do is strive for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_. . . total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and\r\nbad, being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void,\r\nconcentration and distraction, pure and impure. By giving all of them\r\nup, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as void. . . .\r\nOnce we attain that state, not a single form can be discerned. Why?\r\nBecause our self-nature is immaterial and does not catch a single thing\r\nforeign to itself. That which contains no single thing is true Reality.\r\n. . .12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe desire to avoid love and aversion is inextricably tied with the\r\nfreedom from distinctions, duality, judgments, or prejudices:\r\n\r\nWisdom means the ability to distinguish every sort of good and evil;\r\n_dhyana_ means that, though making these distinctions, you remain\r\nwholly unaffected by love or aversion for them.13\r\n\r\nElsewhere he describes this goal as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Being able to behold men, women and all the various sorts of\r\nappearances while remaining as free from love and aversion as if they\r\nwere actually not seen at all. . . .14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In this manner we can operate on the principle of unity, even in a\r\nworld where appearances have multiplicity.\r\n\r\nBut how exactly can we say that all things are one? It is not something\r\nthat can be fully understood with the rational mind, and initially it\r\nmust be taken partly on faith, as a holding action until we can\r\nunderstand it intuitively. His translator John Blofeld uses the\r\ntraditional Buddhist analogy of the sea, which is both constantly\r\nchanging and yet eternally changeless: \"Contemplation of the movement\r\nand shifting composition of sea-waves is a useful symbolical approach;\r\nfor, not only are the waves and the sea identical in substance, but\r\nalso a given wave does not preserve its individual identity for a\r\nsingle moment as the water composing it is never for an instant\r\nentirely the same; thus, by the time it reaches us from a distance,\r\nevery drop it contains will be other than the drops composing it when\r\nwe saw it first. On the other hand, sea-water is sea-water and the wave\r\nis entirely composed of that. Each wave is void--a mere fluctuating\r\nappearance identical in substance with every other wave and with the\r\nentire ocean. . . .\"15 Waves are a perfect metaphor for the idea of\r\neverything and nothing at once, since they are both ephemeral and part\r\nof a larger reality, the sea, out of which they emerge, assume a\r\nphysical appearance, and then dissolve. They seem to exist, yet you\r\ncannot grasp and hold them. They are both existing and nonexistent.\r\nThus they resemble the Void, a kind of energy that manifests itself\r\nthrough diverse illusory objects of the senses, but which is itself\r\nungraspable, changeless unity. With this in mind, perhaps it is easier\r\nto understand Huai-hai when he declares:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The nature of the Absolute is void and yet not void. How so? The\r\nmarvellous \"substance\" of the Absolute, having neither form nor shape,\r\nis therefore undiscoverable; hence it is void. Nevertheless, that\r\nimmaterial, formless \"substance\" contains functions as numerous as the\r\nsands of the Ganges, functions which respond unfailingly to\r\ncircumstances, so it is also described as not void.16\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBy focusing on this idea of unity in an Absolute, we also interact with\r\nour own perception of time. Since it is important that the mind not\r\ndwell on anything, naturally enough this applies to time as well as\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_If you want to understand the non-dwelling mind very clearly, while\r\nyou are actually sitting in meditation, you must be cognizant only of\r\nthe mind. . . . Whatever is past is past, so do not sit in judgment\r\nupon it; for when minding about the past ceases of itself, it can be\r\nsaid that there is no longer any past. Whatever is in the future is not\r\nhere yet, so do not direct your hopes and longings towards it; for,\r\nwhen minding about the future ceases of itself, it can be said that\r\nthere is no future. Whatever is present is now at hand; just be\r\nconscious of your non-attachment to everything--non-attachment in the\r\nsense of not allowing any love or aversion for anything to enter your\r\nmind; for, when minding the present ceases of itself, we may say that\r\nthere is no present.17\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe has taken the idea of the \"now\" to an interesting new dimension. By\r\ncutting off thoughts of past and future, you not only save yourself\r\nmental anguish, you also no longer need distinguish the idea of the\r\n\"present\" . . . and you have just eliminated a major aspect of\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nHuai-hai is not blind to the difficulty of such rigorous mind control,\r\nand he offers some of the first practical advice from a Ch'an master\r\nfor controlling the mind. Not surprisingly, it is an admonition to stop\r\ntrying so hard, to just focus on goals rather than forcing the mind's\r\nbehavior. For example, if you are meditating and your mind wants to\r\nmeander and look for something to dwell on, what should you do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Should your mind wander away, do not follow it, whereupon your\r\nwandering mind will stop wandering of its own accord. Should your mind\r\ndesire to linger somewhere, do not follow it and do not dwell there,\r\nwhereupon your mind's questing for a dwelling place will cease of its\r\nown accord. Thereby, you will come to possess a non-dwelling mind--a\r\nmind which remains in the state of non-dwelling. If you are fully aware\r\nin yourself of a non-dwelling mind, you will discover that there is\r\njust the fact of dwelling, with nothing to dwell upon or not to dwell\r\nupon. This full awareness in yourself of a mind dwelling upon nothing\r\nis known as having a clear perception of your own mind or, in other\r\nwords, as having a clear perception of your own nature.18\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBy way of wrapping up his treatise, he summarizes his technique for\r\nsudden illumination in a bold manifesto:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_You should know that setting forth the principle of deliverance in its\r\nentirety amounts only to this--WHEN THINGS HAPPEN, MAKE NO RESPONSE:\r\nKEEP YOUR MINDS FROM DWELLING ON ANY THING WHATSOEVER: KEEP THEM\r\nFOREVER STILL AS THE VOID AND UTTERLY PURE.19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Perhaps it is time we asked what exactly is the point of all this.\r\nWhen we have achieved his goal, we have effectively cut off all\r\nattachments, rationality, discernment, values, sensations. But why\r\nwould we want to do this in the first place? Huai-hai answers that by\r\nreleasing ourselves from this enslaving bondage to our ego and its\r\nattachments, we become the masters of our own being, free to experience\r\nthe world but no longer at its mercy. And furthermore we no longer have\r\neven to think about being in the state of \"no-thought.\" It is this\r\nnatural state of wisdom that is our goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concentration (_dhyana_) involves the stilling of your mind . . . so\r\nthat you remain wholly unmoved by surrounding phenomena. Wisdom means\r\nthat your stillness of mind is not disturbed by your giving any thought\r\nto that stillness, that your purity is unmarred by your entertaining\r\nany thought of purity and that, in the midst of such pairs of opposites\r\nas good and evil, you are able to distinguish between them without\r\nbeing stained by them and, in this way, to reach the state of being\r\nperfectly at ease and free of all dependence.20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_This is the state called enlightenment, a new way of experiencing\r\nreality that relies entirely upon intuition. Then we realize that all\r\nthis time our rational mind has been leading us along, telling us that\r\nappearances are real and yet keeping us from really experiencing things\r\nfirsthand, since the rational mind believes in names, categories,\r\nduality. Consequently, before this sudden moment of intuitive\r\nunderstanding, we saw the world as through a glass darkly, with\r\nourselves as subject and the falsely perceived exterior world as\r\nobject. After this experience we see things clearly, but we perceive\r\nthem for what they really are--creations of mind as devoid of genuine\r\nsubstance as the world we create in our dreams or the ocean's waves\r\nthat we can see but cannot hold. Knowing this, we can regard the world\r\ndispassionately, no longer caught in the web of ego involvement that\r\nenslaves those not yet enlightened. Since this whole world view only\r\ncan be understood intuitively, it is not surprising that it must one\r\nday \"dawn on you\" when you least expect, like a sudden inspiration that\r\nhits you after logic has failed. Huai-hai's instructions are intended\r\nto be preparations for this moment, attributes to adopt that will make\r\nyou ready and receptive when your \"sudden\" enlightenment hits.\r\n\r\nHuai-hai's concept of sudden enlightenment was quite\r\nstraightforward, and it apparently was not absolutely necessary that\r\nmeditation be employed. (In fact, he has defined _dhyana _as a state of\r\nmind, not an action.) Enlightenment is release from the ego, the\r\nprimary thing standing in the way of mental peace in a world of getting\r\nand spending, of conflict and competition. The ancient Ch'an masters\r\nknew well the griefs and mental distress that haunt the heart of man,\r\nand thinkers such as Huai-hai explored its cure more fully than we\r\nrealize today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Eight\r\n\r\nNAN-CH'UAN AND CHAO-CHOU:\r\n\r\nMASTERS OF THE IRRATIONAL\r\n\r\n\r\nNan-ch'uan P'u-yuan\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best-remembered disciple of Ma-tsu was Nan-ch'uan P'u-yuan (748-\r\n835), founder of a famous monastery and a brilliant if short-lived\r\nlineage whose finest example was his pupil Chao-chou Ts'ung-shen (778-\r\n897). _The Transmission of the Lamp _reports that Nan-ch'uan was born\r\nin the North China province of Honan.1 He began study of meditation at\r\nage ten, and according to the _Biographies of Eminent Monks _compiled\r\nin the Sung (_Sung kao-seng chuan_) he went to study Buddhism on Mt.\r\nSung, near Loyang, when he was thirty and became a priest of\r\ntraditional Buddhism, apparently of the Vinaya school.2 After his\r\nordination, he traveled to various of the better-known monasteries,\r\nperfected his knowledge of Buddhist scriptures, and landed finally at\r\nthe mountain establishment of the Ch'an master Ma-tsu.\r\n\r\nThe legend says that although there were eight hundred followers of Ma-\r\ntsu, the precocious Nan-ch'uan was immediately elevated to the position\r\nof the foremost disciple, and none of the others ventured to debate\r\nwith him.3 He finally achieved his complete enlightenment under the old\r\nmaster. It is not clear when he arrived or how long he stayed with Ma-\r\ntsu, but he reportedly left the monastery in 795--as he neared fifty--and\r\nfounded his own community on Mt. Nan-ch'uan, a location in Anhwei\r\nprovince north of Kiangsi, building the original lodging with his own\r\nhands and attracting several hundred disciples. His most famous\r\nfollower, aside from the later master Chao-chou, was the layman Lu\r\nHsuan, the provincial governor of the Hsuan district. The story says\r\nthat after residing in his mountain retreat for thirty years, without\r\nonce venturing out, he finally acceded to the requests of the governor\r\nto come down and teach Ch'an to the people on the plain. He thus\r\nenjoyed a great fame as a teacher of Ch'an, although today he is\r\nremembered by anecdotes rather than by any attributed writings.\r\n\r\nThe governor seems to have been puzzled by some of the teachings of\r\nSeng-chao (384-414), the early, pre-Ch'an Buddhist. He specifically\r\nasked Nan-ch'uan the meaning of a statement in The Book of Chao that\r\nall things come from the same source and accordingly there can be no\r\ndifference between right and wrong, which are themselves the same, by\r\nvirtue of a common origin. The story says that Nan-ch'uan pointed to a\r\npatch of peonies in the garden and said, \"Governor, when people of the\r\npresent day see these blossoms, it is as if they see them in a dream.\"4\r\n\r\nThe point seerns to be that the unenlightened cannot fully perceive the\r\nflower as it really is, cannot experience it directly and purely.\r\nInstead it is approached as an object apart from the viewer, the\r\nsubject. It is not seen as an extension of his or her own reality. The\r\nordinary mind permits this dichotomy of nature, but in the Zen mind,\r\nman and flower become one, merged into a seamless fabric of life. This\r\nis the kind of statement that in later years would be isolated from the\r\nchronicles and made into a \"public case\" or koan, a teaching device for\r\nnovices. Its meaning is not meant to be discerned through the logical\r\nprocesses, and even less through the medium of language. When a later\r\nmaster was asked what Nan-ch'uan had meant, he answered with the\r\nequally enigmatic \"Pass me a brick.\"5\r\n\r\nThe other celebrated story about the governor is perhaps easier to\r\nunderstand. The story says that one day Lu Hsuan posed the following\r\nproblem to Nan-ch'uan: \"What if I told you that a man had raised a\r\ngoose in a bottle, watching it grow until one day he realized that it\r\nhad grown too large to pass through the bottle's neck? Since he did not\r\nwant to break the bottle or kill the goose, how would he get it out?\"\r\nNan-ch'uan began quietly, \"My esteemed governor,\" and then he shouted,\r\n\"THE GOOSE IS OUT!\" The story says that Lu Hsuan suddenly was\r\nenlightened on the spot.6 Nan-ch'uan had shown that one who posed a\r\nhypothetical question could be answered by an equally hypothetical\r\nresponse. There is a common Ch'an (and Taoist) reference to a truth\r\nbeing caught in the net of words. Here Nan-ch'uan shows how to extract\r\ntruth from verbal encumbrances. Another anecdote recounts a similar\r\nincident:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk said to Nan-ch'uan, \"There is a jewel in the sky; how can we\r\nget hold of it?\" Nan-ch'uan said, \"Cut down bamboos and make a ladder,\r\nput it up in the sky, and get hold of it!'' The monk said, \"How can the\r\nladder be put up in the sky?\" Nan-ch'uan said, \"How can you doubt your\r\ngetting hold of the jewel?_\"7_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nMany of his finest exchanges with pupils are preserved in _The\r\nTransmission of the Lamp_. For maximum impact it is perhaps best to\r\nlean back and let his wordplay wash over the rational mind like a cool,\r\ncleansing surf. As with the Taoist Chuang Tzu, the best way to\r\ncomprehend this antilogical phenomenon is to forget about trying to\r\ngrasp it intellectually, for only then can we understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Governor said, \"There is a piece of stone in my house. Sometimes\r\nit stands up and sometimes it lies down. Now, can it be carved into the\r\nimage of Buddha?\" \"Yes, it is possible,\" answered the Master. \"But it\r\nis impossible to do so?\" countered the Governor.\"It is impossible! It\r\nis impossible!\" exclaimed the Master.8\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThis dialogue sounds almost as though it were from an undiscovered\r\nscene from Waiting for Godot, as Vladimir and Estragon test the\r\nmeaninglessness of language. And for pure Ionesco, it is hard to top\r\nthe following incident:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Once Master Nan-ch'uan told Kuei-tsung and Ma-yu that he was going to\r\ntake them with him to visit Nan-yang Hui-chung, the National Teacher.\r\nBefore they began their journey, Nan-ch'uan drew a circle on the road\r\nand said, \"As soon as you give a right answer we will be on our way.\"\r\nThereupon Kuei-tsung sat down inside the circle and Ma-yu bowed in\r\nwoman's fashion. The Master said to them, \"Judging by this answer, it\r\nwill not be necessary to go._\"9_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Nan-ch'uan toward conventional pieties, as well as\r\ntoward the societal, rationalistic concerns of Confucianism, are\r\nperhaps best illustrated by the farewell he gave to his distinguished\r\nfollower:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When Governor Lu was about to return to his office in Hsuan-cheng, he\r\ncame to bid the Master good-bye. The latter asked him, \"Governor, you\r\nare going back to the capital. How will you govern the people?\" The\r\nGovernor replied, \"I will govern them through wisdom.\" The Master\r\nremarked, \"If this is true, the people will suffer for it._\"10_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nNan-ch'uan had a refreshing lack of pomposity that would have well\r\nserved a good many other Zen masters, ancient and modern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When the Master was washing his clothes, a monk said, \"Master! You\r\nstill are not free from 'this'?\" Master Nan-ch'uan replied, lifting the\r\nclothes, \"What can you do about 'this'?_\"11_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_This calls to mind the anecdote concerning Alexander the Great, who\r\nwhen asked if he was a god as had been widely reported, responded by\r\nsuggesting that the question be directed to the man who carried out his\r\nchamber pot.\r\n\r\nHis attitude toward the great Ch'an teachers of the past  seems\r\nsimilarly lacking in awe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk inquired, \"From patriarch to patriarch there is a transmission.\r\nWhat is it that they transmit to one another?\" The Master said, \"One,\r\ntwo, three, four, five.\" The monk asked, \"What is that which was\r\npossessed by the ancients?\" The Master said, \"When it can be possessed,\r\nI will tell you.\" The monk said dubiously, \"Master, why should you\r\nlie?\" The Master replied, \"I do not lie. [The Sixth Patriarch Hui-neng]\r\nlied._\"12_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nNan-ch'uan was accustomed to the rough-and-tumble of Ma-tsu's\r\nmonastery, a place of shouting, beating, harangues, insults, \"mindless\"\r\ninterviews, misleading clues, and mind-fatiguing \"irrelevancies.\" Yet\r\nit was all done with a high intensity and intended for the quite noble\r\npurpose of forcing a disciple to find his own first nature, his own\r\nenlightenment. The monastery as it developed under these wild men of\r\nSouthern Ch'an was nothing less than a high-pressure cell for those who\r\nchose to enter. Although these new techniques for shaking\r\nnonintellectual insights into Ch'an novices were essentially the\r\ninvention of Ma-tsu, they were transplanted, refined, and expanded by\r\nmen like Nan-ch'uan, whose new monastery seems to have had the same\r\ndeadly-serious zaniness as Ma-tsu's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChao-chou Ts'ung-shen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the most instructive anecdotes associated with Nan-ch'uan are\r\nthose involving his star pupil, Chao-chou Ts'ung-shen (778-897), who\r\ncame to be one of the major figures of the Golden Age of Ch'an and one\r\nof the best-remembered of the wild Southern masters. Although his real\r\nname was Ts'ung-shen, he is remembered in history (as are many Ch'an\r\nmasters) by the name of the mountain where he held forth during his\r\nmature years. He was born in Ts'ao-chou in Shantung and early on became\r\na novice monk at a local monastery. However, the urge to travel was\r\nirresistible and he left before being ordained, arriving at Nan-\r\nch'uan's monastery while still a lad. The traditional first exchange\r\ntypifies their long and fruitful relationship. Nan-ch'uan opened with\r\nthe standard question:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Where have you just come from?\"\r\n\r\n       \"I have just left Shui-hsiang [named for a famous state of\r\nBuddha].\"\r\n\r\n      \"Have you seen the standing image of Buddha?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I see is not a standing image of Buddha but a supine Enlightened\r\nOne!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you your own master or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am. [i.e., I already have a master.]\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is this master of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the middle of the winter the weather becomes bitterly cold. I wish\r\nall blessings on you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n        At this, Nan-ch'uan decided that this visitor was promising and\r\npermitted him to become his disciple.13\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nChao-chou's strange answer seems to have been his own way of signifying\r\nhe had chosen Nan-ch'uan as his future master. Nan-ch'uan, for his own\r\npart, seems to have recognized in this quizzical repartee all the\r\nmakings of a great Ch'an worthy.\r\n\r\nThe exploits of Nan-ch'uan and Chao-chou form the core of the great\r\nanecdotal literature of Ch'an's Golden Age. Neither was a great\r\ninnovator, a great writer, or a great organizer, but together they were\r\nable to explore the highest limits of the dialogue as a vehicle for\r\nenlightenment. And their dialogues, incidentally, did not always\r\nnecessarily require words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day, in the monastery of Nan-chu'an, the monks of the east and\r\nwest wing had a dispute over the possession of a cat. They all came to\r\nNan-ch'uan for arbitration. Holding a knife in one hand and the cat in\r\nthe other, Nan-ch'uan said, \"If any one of you can say the right thing,\r\nthis cat will be saved; otherwise it will be cut into two pieces.\" None\r\nof the monks could say anything. Nan-ch'uan then killed the cat. In the\r\nevening, when Chao-chou returned to the monastery, Nan-ch'uan asked him\r\nwhat he would have said had he been there at the time. Chao-chou took\r\noff his straw sandals, put them upon his head, and walked out.\r\nWhereupon Nan-ch'uan commented, \"Oh, if only you had been here, the cat\r\nwould have been saved._\"14_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nChao-chou's response used no language and was devoid of distinctions,\r\nbeing neither positive nor negative. This is one of the most celebrated\r\nstories in _The Transmission of the Lamp_, and one that is probably\r\nricher if we avoid subjecting it to too much commentary.\r\n\r\nThe point was specifically intended to be as simple as possible, but\r\nthis very simplicity is disturbing to the complicated intellectual\r\nmind. There is a particularly telling story of the exchange Chao-chou\r\nheld with Nan-ch'uan concerning the Tao, meaning the way to\r\nenlightenment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When Chao-chou asked his master, \"What is the Tao?\" the latter\r\nreplied, \"Tao is nothing else than the ordinary mind.\" \"Is there any\r\nway to approach it?\" pursued Chao-chou further. \"Once you intend to\r\napproach it,\" said Nan-ch'uan, \"you are on the wrong track.\" \"Barring\r\nconscious intention,\" the disciple continued to inquire, \"how can we\r\nattain to a knowledge of the Tao?\" To this the master replied, \"Tao\r\nbelongs neither to knowledge nor to no-knowledge. For knowledge is but\r\nillusive perception, while no-knowledge is mere confusion. If you\r\nreally attain true comprehension of the Tao, unshadowed by the\r\nslightest doubt, your vision will be like the infinite space, free of\r\nall limits and obstacles. Its truth or falsehood cannot be established\r\nartificially by external proofs.\" At these words Chao-chou came to an\r\nenlightenment. Only after this did he take his vows and become a\r\nprofessed monk.15\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nNan-ch'uan's assertion that Tao is nothing else than the ordinary mind,\r\nbut that it cannot be reached by deliberate searching, is the\r\nlongstanding commonplace of Ch'an. However, he here adds an interesting\r\nnew assertion: He claims here that although the person finding this\r\nenlightenment has no doubt of its reality, it cannot be proved or\r\ndisproved by any objective tests. There is no way that the enlightened\r\nperson can be shown objectively to have achieved his goal. The Ch'an\r\nmasters could test enlightenment by matching the claimant's illogic\r\nagainst their own; if his \"craziness\" matched, then the disciple\r\npassed. But there is, by definition, no objective test of\r\nenlightenment. But then, how do you test the ultimate realization that\r\nthere is nothing to realize other than what you knew all along? Quite\r\nsimply, the master's intuition is the final authority.\r\n\r\nTheir dialogues frequently were full of electricity, as witness another\r\nexchange that ended quite differently:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chao-chou asked, \"Tao is not external to things; the externality of\r\nthings is not Tao. Then what is the Tao that is beyond things?\" The\r\nmaster struck him. Thereupon Chao- chou took hold of the stick and\r\nsaid, \"From now on, do not strike a man by mistake.\" The Master said,\r\n\"We can easily differentiate between a dragon and a snake, but nobody\r\ncan fool a Ch'an monk._\"10_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nChao-chou here seems to be declaring to Nan-ch'uan that his\r\nenlightenment is genuine. And Nan-ch'uan, for his part, is asserting\r\nthat the Master's judgment, not the monk's, is the final criterion. In\r\nanother incident Chao-chou actually has the last word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Once Nan-ch'uan said to Chao-chou, \"Nowadays it is best to live and\r\nwork among members of a different species from us.\" (This recalls the\r\nBuddhist proverb: It is easier to save the beasts than to save\r\nmankind.) Chao-chou, however, thought otherwise. He said, \"Leaving\r\nalone the question of 'different,' let me ask you what is 'species'\r\nanyway?\" Nan-ch'uan put both of his hands on the ground, to indicate\r\nthe species of the quadrupeds. Chao-chou, approaching him from behind,\r\ntrampled him to the ground, and then ran into the Nirvana Hall crying,\r\n\"I repent, I repent.\" Nan-ch'uan, who appreciated his act of trampling,\r\ndid not understand the reason of his repentance. So he sent his\r\nattendant to ask the disciple what was he repenting for. Chao-chou\r\nreplied, \"I repent that I did not trample him twice over._\"17_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIn spite of such occasional bursts of exuberance, Chao-chou seems\r\noverall to have been comparatively mild-mannered for a Ch'an master. He\r\nrarely chose to berate or beat his disciples, as did Ma-tsu or his own\r\nmaster, Nan-ch'uan. In many ways, Chao-chou was the finest hope for the\r\nlineage of Nan-ch'uan, but he seems not to have been overly concerned\r\nwith its continuation. In fact, it is somewhat ironic that Huai-hai,\r\nwho was more an organizer than a creator, ended up with a lineage\r\nperpetuating his line down to the present day, whereas Nan-ch'uan's\r\nlineage effectively ended with his disciple Chao-chou, although both\r\nmen were remarkable teachers. In fact, Chao-chou almost never did\r\nsettle down to run a monastery. After Nan-ch'uan died he resumed his\r\ntravels and for many years roamed across China, visiting with other\r\nCh'an masters. He seems to have gradually worked his way back north,\r\nfor it was in the north that he realized his most lasting fame and\r\ninfluence. But his reputation was gained before he had a monastery of\r\nhis own and without the aid of permanent disciples. The real acclaim\r\nseems to have been associated with a journey to a famous Buddhist\r\npilgrimage site, Mt. Wut'ai, in the northeastern edge of Shensi\r\nprovince, where he preached a sermon that brought him wide recognition.\r\nAlthough he loved nothing more than wandering the craggy mountains of\r\nChina, friends tried to convince him to settle down--as related in an\r\nincident when he was near eighty, after many years of wandering:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Once, as he was visiting Chu-yu, the latter said, \"A man of your age\r\nshould try to find a place to settle down and teach.\" \"Where is my\r\nabiding place?\" Chao-chou asked back. \"What?\" said his host, \"With so\r\nmany years on your head, you have not even come to know where your\r\npermanent home is!\" Chao-chou said, \"For thirty years I have roamed\r\nfreely on horseback. Today, for the first time I am kicked by an\r\nass!_\"18_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe finally did settle down, at eighty, accepting an invitation to come\r\nand live at the Kuan-yin monastery in Chao-chou in northeastern China,\r\nwhere he stayed until his death some forty years later. His lack of\r\ninterest in worldly, administrative details is illustrated by the story\r\nthat during his forty years as abbot of the monastery he installed no\r\nnew furnishings and made no attempt to collect alms. Perhaps this tells\r\nus why Huai-hai's line won the day. Yet Chao-chou was the popular\r\nfavorite. His preference for colloquial language endeared him to the\r\npeople. He tried to demonstrate that enlightenment can be found and\r\nsubsequently heightened through ordinary everyday activities. The\r\nfollowing anecdote suggests his idea of Buddhism had little to do with\r\nthe Buddha:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Master Chao-chou was asked by a monk, \"Who is the Buddha?\" \"The one in\r\nthe shrine,\" was the answer. \"Isn't it a clay statue that sits in the\r\nshrine?\" the monk went on.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then who is the Buddha?\" the monk repeated.\r\n\r\n\"The one in the shrine,\" replied the Master.\r\n\r\nA monk asked, \"What is my own self?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you finished your rice gruel?\" asked the Master.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have finished it,\" replied the monk.\r\n\r\n\"Then go and wash your dishes,\" said the Master.\r\n\r\nWhen the monk heard this, he was suddenly awakened.19\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe thrust of this anecdote is that through the everyday doing of what\r\nneeds to be done, we can find authentic values and our original nature.\r\nAs the modern scholar Chang Chung-yuan points out, \"This simple\r\nactivity of the Ch'an monk, washing the dishes after eating gruel, is\r\nthe most ordinary thing, the sort of activity that is completely\r\nspontaneous and requires no mental effort. While engaged in it, a man\r\nis free from assertion and negation.\"20\r\n\r\nWhen we are doing manual tasks we experience them directly; we do not\r\nhave to intellectualize about them. This acting without thought,\r\nwithout judgments of good or bad, is in fact a parable of\r\nenlightenment. So it was that Chao-chou could so effectively use rote\r\ntasks as a teaching device, for they showed a novice how he could free\r\nhis mind from its enslavement to opinions and values. This stress on\r\nthe meaningfulness of daily manual activities, as distinct from\r\nphilosophical speculation, seems to have been the major position of\r\nChao-chou. This attitude is particularly borne out in another\r\ncelebrated Chao-chou anecdote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One morning, as Chao-chou was receiving new arrivals, he asked one of\r\nthem, \"Have you been here before?\" \"Yes,\" the latter replied. \"Help\r\nyourself to a cup of tea,\" he said. Then he asked another, \"Have you\r\nbeen here before?\" \"No, Your Reverence, this is my first visit here.\"\r\nChao-chou again said, \"Help yourself to a cup of tea.\" The Prior of the\r\nmonastery took Chao-chou to task, saying, \"The one had been here\r\nbefore, and you gave him a cup of tea. The other had not been here, and\r\nyou gave him likewise a cup of tea. What is the meaning of this?\" Chao-\r\nchou called out, \"Prior!\" \"Yes,\" responded the Prior. \"Help yourself to\r\na cup of tea!_\"21_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBehind this possibly deceptive simplicity, however, there must have\r\nbeen a penetrating intelligence, for a very large number of his\r\nanecdotes were important enough to become enshrined in those famous\r\ncollections of koans the Mumonkan and the Blue Cliff Record. One of the\r\nbest known is the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk asked, \"Since all things return to One, where does this One\r\nreturn to?\" \"When I was in Tsing-chou, I had a robe made which weighed\r\nseven chin [pounds]\" replied the Master.22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The answer is a perfect example of \"no-thought,\" the anti-logic\r\ncondition in which rationality is disengaged. To attempt to subject it\r\nto analysis would be to miss the entire point.\r\n\r\nAn even more famous koan, and one that has become the traditional\r\nstarting point for beginners, is the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk asked Chao-chou, \"Has a dog the Buddha Nature?\" Chao-chou\r\nanswered, \"Mu._\"23_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Here the word _mu_, meaning \"nothingness\" or \"un,\" is an elegant\r\nresolution of a perplexing Zen dilemma. Had Chao-chou answered in the\r\naffirmative, he would have been tacitly instigating a dualistic view of\r\nthe universe, in which a dog and a man are allowed to be discussed as\r\nseparate objects. But to have responded negatively would have been to\r\neven more strongly betray the Zen teaching of the Oneness permeating\r\nall things. An answer was called for, but not an explanation. So the\r\nmaster responded with a nonword--a sound that has been adopted in later\r\nZen practice as symbolic of the unity of all things.\r\n\r\nThis wisdom made Chao-chou such a legend in his own lifetime that many\r\nmonks from the south came north to try to test him, but he always\r\noutwitted them, even when he was well past a hundred. Perhaps it would\r\nbe well to round out his story with a garland of some of the exchanges\r\nhe had with new monks:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A new arrival said apologetically to the master, \"I have come here\r\nempty-handed!\" \"Lay it down then!\" said the master. \"Since I have\r\nbrought nothing with me, what can I lay down?\" asked the visitor. \"Then\r\ngo on carrying it!\" said the master.24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day Chao-chou fell down in the snow, and called out, \"Help me up!\r\nHelp me up!\" A monk came and lay down beside him. Chao-chou got up and\r\nwent away.25\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA monk asked, \"When a beggar comes, what shall we give him?\" The master\r\nanswered, \"He is lacking in nothing.\"26\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a monk asked him, \"What is the real significance of Bodhidharma's\r\ncoming from the west?\" his answer was, \"The cypress tree in the\r\ncourtyard.\" When the monk protested that Chao-chou was only referring\r\nto a mere object, the Abbot said, \"No, I am not referring you to an\r\nobject.\" The monk then repeated again the question. \"The cypress tree\r\nin the courtyard!\" said the Abbot once more.27\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n_A monk besought him to tell him the most vitally important principle\r\nof Ch'an. The master excused himself by saying, \"I must now go to make\r\nwater. Think even such a trifling thing I have to do in person.\"28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chao-chou was of a unique breed of \"Golden Age\" masters, who created\r\nCh'an's finest moment. Even Chao-chou knew this, for he is quoted as\r\nrecognizing that Ch'an had already passed through its most dynamic\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Ninety years ago,\" he said, \"I saw more than eighty enlightened\r\nmasters in the lineage of Ma-tsu; all of them were creative spirits. Of\r\nlate years, the pursuit of Ch'an has become more and more trivialized\r\nand ramified. Removed ever farther from the original spirit of men of\r\nsupreme wisdom, the process of degeneration will go on from generation\r\nto generation._\"29_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nChao-chou died in his one hundred and twentieth year, surely one of the\r\nmost venerable Ch'an masters. Fortunately his pessimistic assessment of\r\nCh'an's future was only partly correct. Although he himself had no\r\nillustrious heirs, there were other Southern Ch'an masters who would\r\nextend the lineage of Ma-tsu into what would one day be the Rinzai\r\nschool, among these a layman named P'ang and the master Huang-po.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Nine\r\n\r\n\r\nP'ANG AND HAN-SHAN:\r\n\r\nLAYMAN AND POET\r\n\r\n\r\n_Han-shan\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nEach of the better-known disciples of Ma-tsu exemplified some\r\nparticular aspect of Ch'an: Whereas Po-chang Huai-hai advanced Ch'an's\r\norganizational and analytical side, Nan-ch'uan embodied the illogical,\r\npsychologically jolting approach to the teaching. But what about the\r\nCh'an outside the monasteries? Did Ma-tsu's influence extend to the lay\r\ncommunity? Although little has been preserved to help answer these\r\nquestions, we do have the stories of two Ch'an poets who operated\r\noutside the monastic system: Layman P'ang (740?-811) and Han-shan\r\n(760?-840?). They were part of a movement called _chu-shih_, lay\r\nbelievers who were drawn to Buddhism but rejected the formal practices,\r\npreferring to remain outside the establishment and seek enlightenment\r\non their own.1 However, P'ang studied under Ma-tsu himself, and Han-shan\r\nsometimes echoed the master's teachings in his verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLayman P'ang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man known to history as Layman P'ang was born in the mid-eighth\r\ncentury.2 He grew to manhood in the city of Heng-yang, where his\r\nConfucianist father served as a middle-level official. Although he was\r\neducated in all the classics, he became a practicing Buddhist early and\r\nnever faltered in his devotion. Sometime after marrying he became so\r\nobsessed with the classic Chinese ideal of a spiritual-poetic hermitage\r\nthat he actually had a thatched cottage built adjacent to his house.\r\nHere he spent time with his wife--and now a daughter and son--meditating,\r\ncomposing poetry, and engaging in characteristically Chinese musings. A\r\nstory relates that he was sitting in his thatched cottage one day when\r\nhe became exasperated with the difficulties of his path and declared,\r\n\"How difficult it is! How difficult it is! My studies are like drying\r\nthe fibers of ten thousand pounds of flax by hanging them in the sun.\"\r\nHis wife overheard this outburst and contradicted him, \"Easy, easy,\r\neasy. It's like touching your feet to the ground when you get out of\r\nbed. I have found the teaching right in the tops of flowering plants.\"\r\nHis daughter, Ling-chao, heard both outbursts and showed them the truth\r\nwith her assertion, \"My study is neither difficult nor easy. When I am\r\nhungry I eat. When I am tired I rest.\"3\r\n\r\nThen one day, thought to have been sometime between the years 785 and\r\n790, P'ang decided to go the final step and sever his ties with the\r\nmaterialism that weighed him down. After donating his house for a\r\ntemple, he loaded his remaining possessions into a boat--which he\r\nproceeded to maneuver into the middle of a river and sink.\r\n\r\nWe do not know if his wife and son welcomed this final freedom from\r\nmaterial enslavement, but his daughter seems to have approved, for she\r\nhelped him wend his now-penurious way through the world by assisting\r\nhim in making and selling bamboo household articles. Free at last,\r\nP'ang traveled about from place to place with no fixed abode, living,\r\nso the legends say, \"like a leaf.\" The image of P'ang and his daughter\r\nas itinerant peddlers, wandering from place to place, made a searing\r\nimpression on the Chinese mind, and for centuries he has been admired\r\nin China--admired, but not necessarily emulated.\r\n\r\nWhom did P'ang go to visit? He seems to have known personally every\r\nmajor Ch'an figure in China. The first master visited was the famous\r\nShih-t'ou (700-790), sometime rival of Ma-tsu. (It will be recalled\r\nthat the Sixth Patriarch, Hui-neng, had among his disciples a master\r\ncalled Huai-jang (677-744), teacher of Ma-tsu and head of the lineage\r\nof now Japanese Rinzai. Another of the Sixth Patriarch's legendary\r\nfollowers was Hsing-ssu [d. 740], whose pupil Shih-t'ou is connected to\r\nthe line that became Japanese Soto. Ma-tsu and Shih-t'ou headed the two\r\nmajor movements of Southern Ch'an in the eighth century.)4 In 786 P'ang\r\nappeared at the retreat of Shih-t'ou on the mountain called Nan-yueh.\r\nHe greeted Shih-t'ou by asking him one of the standard Ch'an questions,\r\nwhich Shih-t'ou answered by quietly placing a hand over P'ang's mouth--\r\ncausing the Layman's first enlightenment experience. P'ang studied\r\nunder Shih-t'ou--although probably in a nonmonastic capacity--for some\r\ntime, until one day Shih-t'ou decided to test him.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" began Shih-t'ou, \"how have you practiced Ch'an after coming\r\nhere to this mountain?\"\r\n\r\nP'ang shot back in a characteristic manner, saying, \"There is really\r\nnothing words can reveal about my daily life.\"\r\n\r\nShih-t'ou continued, \"It is just because I know words cannot that I ask\r\nyou now.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, P'ang was moved to offer a verse:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_My daily activities are not unusual,\r\n\r\nI'm just naturally in harmony with them.\r\n\r\nGrasping nothing, discarding nothing,\r\n\r\nIn every place there's no hindrance, no conflict.\r\n\r\n[My] supernatural power and marvelous activity:\r\n\r\nDrawing water and carrying firewood.(5)\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n       The declaration that drawing water and carrying firewood were\r\nmiraculous acts demonstrated P'ang's understanding of \"everyday-\r\nmindedness\"--the teaching of no-teaching, the approach of no-approach.6\r\nThe story says that Shih-t'ou acknowledged the Layman's enlightenment,\r\nand went on to inquire whether P'ang wished to exchange his pauper's\r\nrobe of white for a monk's raiment of black. P'ang reputedly answered\r\nhim with an abrupt \"I will do what I like.\" Apparently concluding that\r\nhe had absorbed all of Shih-t'ou's teaching, P'ang arose and absented\r\nhimself, heading for Kiangsi and the master Ma-tsu.\r\n\r\n       P'ang's adventures with Ma-tsu are not particularly well\r\nrecorded, given the two years he reportedly studied under the master.\r\nHowever, the account of their meeting has become a Ch'an standard.\r\nAccording to the story, P'ang asked Ma-tsu,            \"What kind of\r\nman is he who has no companion among all things?\"\r\n\r\n         Ma-tsu answered, \"After you swallow all the water in the West\r\nRiver in one gulp, I will tell you.\" It is said that when P'ang heard\r\nthis, he was suddenly aware of the essence of Ch'an.7\r\n\r\nIf this exchange seems puzzling, with its subtle wordplay that weaves\r\nin and out between realism and symbolism, what about another recorded\r\nexchange between the two:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day the Layman addressed Ma-tsu, saying: \"A man of unobscured\r\noriginal nature asks you please to look upward.\"\r\n\r\nMa-tsu looked straight down.\r\n\r\nThe Layman said: \"You alone play marvelously on the stringless ch'in\r\n[lute].\"\r\n\r\nMa-tsu looked straight up.\r\n\r\nThe Layman bowed low. Ma-tsu returned to his quarters.\r\n\r\n       \"Just now bungled it trying to be smart,\" then said the Layman.8\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe modern master Charles Luk speculates that P'ang's request to Ma-tsu\r\nto look up at an enlightened man was intended to trap the old master:\r\n\"In reply Ma-tsu looked down to reveal the functioning of the\r\nenlightened mind. P'ang then praised the master for playing so well on\r\nthe stringless lute. Thereat Ma-tsu looked up to return functioning to\r\nthe enlightened mind. . . . In Ch'an parlance, looking down is\r\n'function,' which means the mind wandering outside to deliver living\r\nbeings, and looking up is returning function to 'substance' (the mind)\r\nafter the work of salvation has been done. P'ang's act of prostrating\r\nis 'function' and Ma-tsu's return to the abbot's room means returning\r\nfunction to 'substance' to end the dialogue, for nothing further can be\r\nadded to reveal substance and function.\"9\r\n\r\nAlthough the Layman declined monastic orders, he apparently could hold\r\nhis own with the best of Ma-tsu's followers, as well as with other\r\nCh'an monks he encountered in his travels. Often monks sought him out\r\nmerely to match wits. A typical exchange is reported with a follower of\r\nShih-t'ou named P'u-chi, who once came to test P'ang:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day P'u-chi visited the Layman.\r\n\r\n       \"I recall that when I was in my mother's womb I had a certain\r\nword,\" said the Layman. \"I'll show it to you, but you mustn't hold it\r\nas a principle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're still separated from life,\" said P'u-chi.\r\n\r\n       \"I just said you mustn't hold it as a principle,\" rejoined the\r\nLayman.\r\n\r\n        \"How can I not be awed by a word that astounds people?\" said\r\nP'u-chi.\r\n\r\n        \"Understanding such as yours is enough to astonish people,\"\r\nreplied the Layman.\r\n\r\n         \"The very statement 'don't hold it as a principle' has become\r\na principle,\" said P'u-chi.\r\n\r\n         \"You're separated not only by one or two lives,\" said the\r\nLayman.\r\n\r\n         \"It's all right for you to reprove a rice-gruel [-eating] monk\r\n[like me],\" returned P'u-chi.\r\n\r\nThe Layman snapped his fingers three times.10\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n       The precise meaning of this exchange will not be tackled here,\r\nbut P'ang apparently came off on top. Now and then, however, P'ang\r\nseems to have been equaled or bested. There is a story of an exchange\r\nhe had with one of the monks at Ma-tsu's monastery, named Shih-lin.\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nOne day Shih-lin said to the Layman: \"I have a question I'd like to\r\nask. Don't spare your words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please go on,\" said the Layman.\r\n\r\n\"How you do spare words!\" exclaimed Shih-lin.\r\n\r\n\"Unwittingly by this discussion we've fallen into a snare [of words],\"\r\nsaid the Layman.\r\n\r\nShih-lin covered his ears.\r\n\r\n\"You adept, you adept!\" cried the Layman.11\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAnother time P'ang is reminiscent of Chao-chou in demonstrating that it\r\nis possible to hold one's own without the use of words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Layman was once lying on his couch reading a sutra. A monk saw him\r\nand said: \"Layman! You must maintain dignity when reading a sutra.\"\r\n\r\nThe Layman raised up one leg.\r\n\r\nThe monk had nothing to say.12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nLayman P'ang studied under Ma-tsu for two years, but he finally decided\r\nto resume his life as a wandering student of Ch'an. He left Ma-tsu\r\ndeclaring the family his source of strength, or so it would seem from\r\nhis parting verse presented to the master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_I've a boy who has no bride,\r\n\r\nI've a girl who has no groom;\r\n\r\nForming a happy family circle,\r\n\r\nWe speak about Birthless.13\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAnd off he went to travel, a completely enlightened man after his stay\r\nin Kiangsi. He turned increasingly to poetry during these years of\r\nwandering across the central part of China, composing some of his most\r\nsensitive verse. One poem in particular seems to capture the carefree\r\nspirit of these years of wanderings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The wise man, perceiving wealth and lust,\r\n\r\nKnows them to be empty illusion;\r\n\r\nFood and clothes sustain body and life--\r\n\r\nI advise you to learn being as is.\r\n\r\nWhen it's time, I move my hermitage and go,\r\n\r\nAnd there's nothing to be left behind.14\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nOne of Layman P'ang's most enduring companions was the monk Tan-hsia\r\nT'ien-jan, known for his irreverence. The following is typical of the\r\nexchanges recorded between the two:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When the Layman was walking with Tan-hsia one day he saw a deep pool\r\nof clear water. Pointing to it with his hand, he said: \"Being as it is\r\nwe can't differentiate it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we can't,\" replied Tan-hsia.\r\n\r\nThe Layman scooped up and threw two handfuls of water on Tan-hsia.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that, don't do that!\" cried Tan-hsia.\r\n\r\n\"I have to, I have to!\" exclaimed the Layman.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Tan-hsia scooped up and threw three handfuls of water on the\r\nLayman, saying: \"What can you do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else,\" replied the Layman.\r\n\r\n\"One seldom wins by a fluke,\" said Tan-hsia.\r\n\r\n\"Who lost by a fluke?\" returned the Layman.15\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nTo attempt to explicate this exchange would be to ride the wind. They\r\nare in a completely different reality from that in which mere books are\r\nwritten and read.\r\n\r\nWhat occupied Madam P'ang during the Layman's wanderings is not known.\r\nHowever, she seems well on the way to enlightenment herself. A story\r\nsays that one day she went to a Buddhist temple to make an offering of\r\nfood. The priest asked her the purpose of the offering so that he could\r\npost the customary notice identifying the name of a donor and the date\r\nand purpose of the gift. This was called \"transferring merit,\" since\r\nthe knowledge of her good deed would be \"transferred\" from herself to\r\nothers. It is reported that Mrs. P'ang took her comb, stuck it in the\r\nback of her hair, and announced to the stunned priest, \"Transference of\r\nmerit is accomplished.\"16 She seemed a part of P'ang's enlightenment,\r\neven if not a companion in his travels.\r\n\r\nEventually P'ang and his daughter, Ling-chao, ended up back in the\r\nnorth, near Hsiang-yang, the city of his birth, which he had left when\r\na very small child. But instead of moving into the town, they lived in\r\na cave about twenty miles to the south. And to this cave often\r\njourneyed a distinguished visitor--Prefect Yu Ti of Hsiang province, an\r\nimportant official who had learned of P'ang's verse and his reputation\r\nfor Ch'an teaching. Originally a vicious and arrogant dictator who\r\ndelighted in persecuting Buddhists, he had been converted by a Ch'an\r\nmonk and had become a strong supporter of the faith. In fact, it is Yu\r\nTi whom we must thank for our knowledge of P'ang, for it was he who\r\ncollected the poetry and stories of the Layman after his death.\r\n\r\nP'ang lived in his cave with Ling-chao for two years, and then he\r\nsuddenly declared that it was time to die. In a dramatic gesture, he\r\nassumed a meditating posture and asked Ling-chao to go outside and tell\r\nhim when the sun reached high noon, at which time he would pass on. She\r\nwent out, but quickly returned to announce that it was already noon but\r\nthat there was an eclipse. P'ang jumped up and ran out to see this\r\nevent, but while he was gone Ling-chao seated herself in his place,\r\nfolded her hands, and died herself. P'ang returned from her\r\ndiversionary announcement, saw what had happened, and declared, \"Her\r\nway was always swift. Now she has gone ahead of me.\" In respect he\r\npostponed his own death for a week.17\r\n\r\nHearing of this episode, Prefect Yu Ti rushed to the scene. The Layman\r\naddressed him with, \"I pray you to hold all that is thought to be real\r\nas empty, and never take that which is empty as being real. Farewell.\r\nThe world is merely a shadow, an echo.\"18 He then laid his head on the\r\nprefect's knee and died. He left a request that his body be cremated\r\nand his ashes scattered across the waters of nearby lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\nWhen P'ang's wife heard of the death of her husband and daughter, she\r\nsaid, \"That stupid girl and ignorant old man have gone away without\r\ntelling me. How unbearable.\"19 She then relayed the news to her son, who\r\nwas in the fields hoeing. He too subsequently died miraculously, while\r\nstill standing up. For her own part, Madam P'ang journeyed about the\r\ncountryside bidding her friends farewell, and then secluded herself,\r\nwhere it was never known. And with her passing ends the saga of Layman\r\nP'ang. This real-life individual was honored as China's answer to the\r\nmythical Indian businessman Vimalakirti, who combined enlightenment\r\nwith the life of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHan Shan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn even more elusive figure is the hermit Han-shan, whose name means\r\n\"Cold Mountain,\" the site where he supposedly resided. He is an almost\r\ntotally lengendary character, for we actually know nothing for sure\r\nabout when he lived (the current best guess is late eighth to early\r\nninth century). Almost everything known about him has been gleaned from\r\nhis poems and from a presumably contemporaneous preface to these poems\r\ncomposed by a mysterious hand untraceable to any historical Chinese\r\nindividual. His was some of the most confessional, yet joyous, verse\r\npenned in T'ang China, and he has been claimed by the Ch'anists as one\r\nof theirs--although he might just as easily have been a Taoist\r\nconversant in Buddhist jargon. Han-shan embodied the archetypal hero of\r\nthe Chinese imagination: a member of the rural gentry who gave up his\r\nstaid family life and some sort of scholarly career to become a\r\nwandering poet. As he describes his own early life in the years before\r\nhis wanderings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From my father and mother I inherited land enough\r\n\r\nAnd need not envy others' orchards and fields\r\n\r\nCreak, creak goes the sound of my wife's loom;\r\n\r\nBack and forth my children prattle at their play.\r\n\r\n                                     *   *   *\r\n\r\nThe mountain fruits child in hand I pluck;\r\n\r\nMy paddy field along with my wife I hoe.\r\n\r\nAnd what have I got inside my house?\r\n\r\nNothing at all but one stand of books.20_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we have a gentleman scholar, comfortably well off, with wife and\r\nchildren and an idyllic life undisturbed by the incursions of the\r\nworld. It is all too perfect by half, and sure enough sometime before\r\nhis thirtieth year his life was disrupted by an (undescribed) event so\r\ncatastrophic that his wife and family turned him out:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_I took along books when I hoed the fields,\r\n\r\nIn my youth, when I lived with my older brother.\r\n\r\nThen people began to talk;\r\n\r\nEven my wife turned against me.\r\n\r\nNow I've broken my ties with the world of red dust;\r\n\r\nI spend my time wandering and read all I want.\r\n\r\nWho will lend a dipper of water\r\n\r\nTo save a fish in a carriage rut.21\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nJust when this sad event took place we do not know. However, by the\r\ntime Han-shan was thirty he found himself on Cold Mountain, part of the\r\nT'ien-tai mountain range and near the town of T'ang-hsing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty years ago I was born into the world.\r\n\r\nA thousand, ten thousand miles I've roamed,\r\n\r\nBy rivers where the green grass lies thick,\r\n\r\nBeyond the border where the red sands fly.\r\n\r\nI brewed potions in a vain search for life everlasting.\r\n\r\nI read books, I sang songs of history,\r\n\r\nAnd today I've come home to Cold Mountain\r\n\r\nTo pillow my head on the stream and wash my ears.22\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe described his life in the mountains in a number of verses that often\r\nseem more Taoist than Buddhist. One of the most lyrical follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ever since the time when I hid in the Cold Mountain\r\n\r\nI have kept alive by eating the mountain fruits.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day what is there to trouble me?\r\n\r\nThis my life follows a destined course.\r\n\r\nThe days and months flow ceaseless as a stream;\r\n\r\nOur time is brief as the flash struck on a stone.\r\n\r\nIf Heaven and Earth shift, then let them shift;\r\n\r\nI shall still be sitting happy among the rocks.23\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe was a contradictory individual, one minute solemn in his search for\r\nMind, and the next minute a buoyant bon vivant, writing verses that\r\nseem almost a T'ang version of our own carpe diem:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of course there are some people who are careful of money,\r\n\r\nBut not I among them.\r\n\r\nBecause I dance too much, my garment of thin cloth is worn.\r\n\r\nMy bottle is empty, for I spurt out the wine when we sing.\r\n\r\nEat a full meal.\r\n\r\nDon't tire your feet.\r\n\r\nThe day when weeds are sprouting through your skull,\r\n\r\nYou will regret what you have been.24\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe life he describes for himself is one immersed in poetry. He is the\r\ncompleat poet, whose only concern is writing (not publishing) verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Once at Cold Mountain, troubles cease--\r\n\r\nNo more tangled, hung-up mind,\r\n\r\nI idly scribble poems on the rock cliff,\r\n\r\nTaking whatever comes, like a drifting boat.25\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_But if his poems were written on a rock cliff, how then were they\r\npreserved? Thereon hangs a tale, or more likely a legend. At some\r\nunknown time, Han-shan's verses (some three hundred) were collected and\r\nsupplied with a \"preface.\"26 The person who takes credit for saving Han-\r\nshan from a country poet's oblivion identifies himself as Lu-ch'iu Yin,\r\na high official. As it happens, the T'ang Chinese were very fussy about\r\nkeeping records on such things as high officials, and a Lu-ch'iu Yin is\r\nnot remembered among their ranks. Consequently, some have speculated\r\nthat the author of the preface was in fact a Buddhist priest who wished\r\nto remain anonymous. At any rate, according to the story, our official\r\nfirst heard of Han-shan upon becoming ill just before a planned trip to\r\na new prefecture and, after failing to be helped by a doctor, was cured\r\nby a wandering priest, who then told him that in the prefecture of his\r\ndestination he would need further protection from bodily ills. Lu-ch'iu\r\nYin asked him for the name of a master, and the priest told him to be\r\non the lookout for two eccentric-appearing kitchen servants at the Kuo-\r\nch'ing monastery dining hall, named Han-shan and Shih-te.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at his new post, he immediately sought out this\r\nmonastery and was amazed to learn the story was true. People around the\r\ntemple said, \"Yes, there is a Han-shan. He lives alone in the hills at\r\na place called Cold Mountain, but he often comes down to the temple to\r\nvisit his friend, Shih-te. The cook, Shih-te, it turned out, saved\r\nleftovers for his friend Han-shan, who would come and take them away in\r\na bamboo tube, merrily laughing and joking along the length of the\r\ntemple veranda as he carted away his booty. Once the monks caught him\r\nand exposed his system, but he only laughed all the more. His\r\nappearance was that of a starving beggar, but his wisdom was that of a\r\nman of enlightenment.\r\n\r\nLu-ch'iu Yin anxiously pressed on to the kitchen, where sure enough he\r\nfound Han-shan and Shih-te, tending the stoves and warming themselves\r\nover the fire. When he bowed low to them, they broke into gales of\r\nlaughter and shouted \"HO\" back at him. The other monks were scandalized\r\nand wondered aloud why a distinguished official would bow to a pair of\r\nne'er-do-wells. But before he could explain, the pair clasped hands and\r\nbolted out of the temple. (The giggling Han-shan and Shih-te became a\r\nstaple of Zen art for a millennium thereafter.) Determined to retrieve\r\nthem, he arranged for the monastery to provide them permanent\r\naccommodations and left a package of clothes and incense for them. When\r\nthey failed to reappear, he had a bearer carry his gifts and accompany\r\nhim up into the mountains. Finally they glimpsed Han-shan, who yelled,\r\n\"Thief! Thief!\" at them and retreated to the opening of a cave. He then\r\nbade them farewell with, \"Each of you men should strive to your\r\nutmost!\" Whereupon he disappeared into the cave, which itself then\r\nclosed upon him, leaving no trace. The preface says Han-shan was never\r\nseen again. In homage the disappointed Lu-ch'iu Yin had his poems\r\ncollected from where they had been composed--on scraps of bamboo, wood,\r\nstones, cliffs, and on the walls of houses. Thus there came to be the\r\ncollected _oeuvre _of Han-shan.\r\n\r\nHan-shan's poems support at least part of this somewhat fanciful story.\r\nHe does seem to have been Buddhist in outlook, and as one of his\r\ntranslators, Burton Watson, has declared, \". . . to judge from his\r\npoetry, Han-shan was a follower of the Ch'an sect, which placed great\r\nemphasis on individual effort and was less wary of emotionalism than\r\nearlier Buddhism had been. . . . Though he writes at times in a mood of\r\nserenity, at other times he appears despondent, angry, arrogant, or\r\nwildly elated. . . ,\"27\r\n\r\nAs did Layman P'ang, Han-shan seems to have believed that the Way is\r\nfound in everyday-mindedness, a point of view most forcefully expounded\r\nby Ma-tsu. As Han-shan declares in one of his poems:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_As for me, I delight in the everyday Way,\r\n\r\nAmong mist-wrapped vines and rocky caves.\r\n\r\nHere in the wilderness I am completely free,\r\n\r\nWith my friends, the white clouds, idling forever.\r\n\r\nThere are roads, but they do not reach the world;\r\n\r\nSince I am mindless, who can rouse my thoughts?\r\n\r\nOn a bed of stone I sit, alone in the night,\r\n\r\nWhile the round moon climbs up Cold Mountain.28 _\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of his verses reinforce the belief that he was indeed a follower\r\nof Southern Ch'an. For example, he seemed to believe that the mind\r\nitself is the Buddha that all seek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Talking about food won't make you full,\r\n\r\nBabbling of clothes won't keep out the cold.\r\n\r\nA bowl of rice is what fills the belly;\r\n\r\nIt takes a suit of clothing to make you warm.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, without stopping to consider this,\r\n\r\nYou complain that Buddha is hard to find.\r\n\r\nTurn your mind within! There he is!\r\n\r\nWhy look for him abroad?29\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, for all his rather traditional Ch'an sentiments\r\nand admonitions, he was much more in touch with\r\n\r\nhuman concerns than were most followers of Ch'an. For one thing, he\r\nlived alone in the mountains, an isolated ascetic cut off from human\r\ncontact, and the resulting loneliness was something those caught up in\r\nthe riotous give-and-take of a Ch'an monastery never knew. He gives\r\nvoice to this loneliness in a touching poem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_I look far off at T'ien-t'ai's summit,\r\n\r\nAlone and high above the crowding peaks.\r\n\r\nPines and bamboos sing in the wind that sways them\r\n\r\nSea tides wash beneath the shining moon.\r\n\r\nI gaze at the  mountain's green borders below\r\n\r\nAnd discuss philosophy with the white clouds.\r\n\r\nIn the wilderness, mountains and seas are all right,\r\n\r\nBut I wish I had a companion in my search for the Way.30\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe admission of loneliness and near-despair in many of his verses has\r\nalways been a troublesome point for Zen commentators. The enlightened\r\nman is supposed to be immune to the misgivings of the heart, focused as\r\nhe is on oneness and nondistinction. But Han-shan worried a good bit\r\nabout old age, and he also missed his family, as he admits, albeit\r\nthrough the medium of a dream:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Last night in a dream I returned to my old home\r\n\r\nAnd saw my wife weaving at her loom.\r\n\r\nShe held her shuttle poised, as though lost in thought,\r\n\r\nAs though she had no strength to lift it further.\r\n\r\nI called. She turned her head to look,\r\n\r\nBut her eyes were blank--she didn't know me.\r\n\r\nSo many years we've been parted\r\n\r\nThe hair at my temples has lost its old color.31\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it is this non-Ch'an quality, this mortal touch, that\r\nelevates Han-shan to the rank of a great lyrical poet. He actually\r\nmanages to be both a plausible Buddhist and a vulnerable human being.\r\nFew other poets in Chinese letters managed to combine genuine Buddhism\r\nwith such memorable verse. As Burton Watson has observed, \"In the works\r\nof most first-rate Chinese poets, Buddhism figures very slightly,\r\nusually as little more than a vague mood of resignation or a\r\npicturesque embellishment in the landscape--the mountain temple falling\r\ninto melancholy ruin, the old monk one visits on an outing in the\r\nhills. Han-shan, however, is a striking exception to this rule. The\r\ncollection of poetry attributed to him . . . is permeated with deep and\r\ncompelling religious feeling. For this reason he holds a place of\r\nspecial importance in Chinese literature. He proved that it was\r\npossible to write great poetry on Buddhist, as well as Confucian and\r\nTaoist, themes; that the cold abstractions of Mahayana philosophy could\r\nbe transformed into personal and impassioned literature. . . . The\r\nlanguage of his poems is simple, often colloquial or even slangy . . .\r\n[but] many of his images and terms are drawn from the Buddhist sutras\r\nor the sayings of the Southern School of Zen, whose doctrine of the\r\nBuddha as present in the minds of all men--of Buddha as the mind itself--\r\nhe so often refers to. At the same time he is solidly within the\r\nChinese poetic tradition, his language again and again echoing the\r\nworks of earlier poets. . . .\"32\r\n\r\nWith Han-shan we return repeatedly to the world of Cold Mountain, which\r\nwas--as another of his translators, Arthur Waley, has pointed out--as\r\nmuch a state of mind as a locality. It was this, together with his\r\nadvice to look within, that finally gives Han-shan his haunting voice\r\nof Ch'an. He seems not to have cared for the supercilious \"masters\" who\r\ndominated the competitive world of the monasteries. He invited them to\r\njoin him in the rigorous but rewarding world of \"Cold Mountain,\" where\r\nthe mind was Buddha and the heart was home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When men see Han-shan\r\n\r\nThey all say he's crazy\r\n\r\nAnd not much to look at--\r\n\r\nDressed in rags and hides.\r\n\r\nThey don't get what I say\r\n\r\n& I don't talk their language.\r\n\r\nAll I can say to those I meet:\r\n\r\n\"Try and make it to Cold Mountain._\"33_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Ten\r\n\r\nHUANG-PO:\r\n\r\nMASTER OF THE UNIVERSAL MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most thoughtful Zen philosopher of them all was Huang-po\r\n(d. 850?), who picked up where the earlier teachers had left off and\r\nbrought to a close the great creative era of Ch'an. He also stood at\r\nthe very edge of the tumultuous watershed in Chinese Buddhism, barely\r\nliving past the 845 Great Persecution that smashed the power of all the\r\nBuddhist schools except that of the reclusive Southern Ch'anists.\r\n\r\nOriginally named Hsi-yun, the master moved at a young age from his\r\nbirthplace in present-day Fukien to Mt. Huang-po in the same province,\r\nthe locale that gave him his Ch'an title. His biography declares that\r\nhis voice was articulate and mellifluous, his character open and\r\nsimple.1 He later decided to make a pilgrimage to see the famous Ma-tsu,\r\nbut when he arrived in Kiangsi he was told that the master had died.2\r\nPo-chang Huai-hai was still there, however, and consequently Huang-po\r\nsettled down to study with him instead.\r\n\r\nHuang-po is known to us today primarily through the accident of having\r\na follower obsessed by the written word. This man, Pei Hsiu, was also a\r\nhigh Chinese official who served as governor in two of the provinces\r\nwhere Huang-po at various times resided. He studied under Huang-po both\r\ntimes (all day and night, so he claimed) and later produced an\r\nanecdotal summary of the master's teachings now known as _On the\r\nTransmission of Mind_.3 This document was extensive, representing one of\r\nthe most detailed descriptions of an early master's thoughts. Pei Hsiu\r\nalso reports in his preface (dated 858) that he sent his work back to\r\nKuang T'ang monastery on Mt. Huang-po to have it authenticated by the\r\nold monks there who still remembered the sayings of the master.4\r\n\r\nBy the time of Huang-po the issue of \"gradual\" versus \"sudden\"\r\nenlightenment was decisively resolved in favor of the latter. He\r\ntherefore turned instead to two major remaining questions: 1) how\r\nenlightenment fits into the mental world, and 2) how this intuitive\r\ninsight can be transmitted. Before he was through he had advanced these\r\nissues significantly and had laid the philosophical basis for the next\r\nphase of Ch'an in China--to be dominated by the school of his pupil Lin-\r\nchi.\r\n\r\nHuang-po struggled with a fundamental dilemma of Ch'an: how the\r\nwordless wisdom of intuition can be passed from generation to\r\ngeneration. Enlightenment necessarily has to be intuitive, and that\r\nmeans traditional teaching methods are useless. There are no conceptual\r\nformulations or \"concepts.\" It is by definition wordless. It has to be\r\nrealized intuitively by the novice, by himself. The masters had\r\nisolated a type of knowledge that words could not transmit. It was this\r\ntransmission of wordless insight, of Mind, that obsessed Huang-po.\r\n\r\nHis teachings are well summarized by his biographer Pei Hsiu, who\r\ndeclared: \"Holding in esteem only the intuitive method of the Highest\r\nVehicle, which cannot be communicated in words, he taught nothing but\r\nthe doctrine of the One Mind; holding that there is nothing else to\r\nteach, in that both mind and substance are void. . . . To those who\r\nhave realized the nature of Reality, there is nothing old or new, and\r\nconceptions of shallowness and depth are meaningless. Those who speak\r\nof it do not attempt to explain it, establish no sects, and open no\r\ndoors or windows. That which is before you is it. Begin to reason about\r\nit and you will at once fall into error.\"5\r\n\r\nHe seems to have been preoccupied with the issue of transmission even\r\nduring the early days of studying under Huai-hai. His very first\r\nquestion to the older master reportedly was \"How did the early Ch'an\r\nmasters guide their followers?\" Huai-hai answered this very un-Ch'an\r\nquestion with silence, an implied rebuke. When Huang-po pressed the\r\npoint, Huai-hai called him a disappointing disciple and said he had\r\nbest beware or he (Huang-po) would be the man who lost Ch'an.6\r\n\r\nIn a later episode, however, Huai-hai designates Huang-po as a\r\nsuccessor in Dharma, via a famous transmission exchange in which Huang-\r\npo finally demonstrates wordless communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day Huai-hai asked Huang-po, \"Where have you been?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was that he had been at the foot of the Ta-hsiung\r\n\r\nMountain picking mushrooms. Huai-hai continued, \"Have you seen any\r\ntigers?\" Huang-po immediately roared like a tiger. Huai-hai picked up\r\nan ax as if to chop the tiger. Huang-po suddenly slapped Huai-hai's\r\nface. Huai-hai laughed heartily, and then returned to his temple and\r\nsaid to the assembly, \"At the foot of the Ta-hsiung Mountain there is a\r\ntiger. You people should watch out. I have already been bitten today_.\"7\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n_This enigmatic utterance by Huai-hai has been taken by many to signify\r\nthat Huang-po was being acknowledged as a worthy being, perhaps even a\r\nsuccessor. The scholar Chang Chung-yuan has observed that the genius of\r\nthis response was its freedom from the trap of logical assertion or\r\nnegation.8 The act signified freedom from the alternatives of words or\r\nsilence. Could it be that with this incident we have finally captured a\r\nwordless transmission?\r\n\r\nHuang-po also had a number of exchanges in later years with Nan-ch'uan\r\n(738-824), another of his seniors who had studied at the feet of old\r\nMa-tsu. As the story is reported in _The Transmission of the Lamp_:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some time later Huang-po was with Nan-ch'uan. All the monks in Nan-\r\nch'uan's monastery were going out to harvest cabbage. Nan-ch'uan asked\r\nHuang-po, \"Where are you going?\" Huang-po answered, \"I am going to pick\r\ncabbage.\" Nan-ch'uan went on, \"What do you use to pick cabbage?\" Huang-\r\npo lifted his sickle. Nan-ch'uan remarked, \"You take the objective\r\nposition as a guest, but you do not know how to preside as a host in\r\nthe subjective position.\" Huang-po thereupon knocked on the ground\r\nthree times with his sickle.9\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nWhen Blofeld translates this puzzling episode from _On the Transmission\r\nof Mind_, he comments that he has been unable to find a modern Zen\r\nmaster who could explain its meaning.10 However, Nan-ch'uan's final\r\nremark questions the degree of Huang-po's enlightenment, and some\r\nassume the latter knocked on the ground to signify defeat.11\r\n\r\nAs did other masters, Huang-po also employed silence as a teaching\r\ndevice, using it to teach wordless insight by example. One particularly\r\npointed story involves none other than his biographer, the official Pei\r\nHsiu. In Pei Hsiu's introduction to his transcript of Huang-po's\r\nteachings he says that they first met in 843 when he invited the master\r\nto lecture at Lung-hsing Temple in Chung-ling, the district which he\r\ngoverned. Six years later, in 849, the governor was in charge of Wan-\r\nling, and he again invited the master to come and teach, this time at\r\nthe local K'ai-yan temple.12\r\n\r\nWhen Huang-po arrived in Wan-ling, for what was to be the second\r\nteaching session with Pei Hsiu, the story says that the governor made\r\nthe mistake of presenting the master with a written exposition of the\r\nteachings of Ch'an. Huang-po greeted this with silence, his\r\n\"exposition\" of Ch'an.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prime Minister invited the Master to the city and presented his\r\nown written interpretation of Ch'an to him. The Master took it and put\r\nit on the table. He did not read it. After a short silence, he asked\r\nthe Prime Minister, \"Do you understand?\" The minister answered, \"I do\r\nnot understand.\" The Master said, \"It would be better if you could\r\nunderstand immediately through inner experience. If it is expressed in\r\nwords, it won't be our teaching._\"13_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n_The Transmission of the Lamp_ reports that after this episode at Wan-\r\nling, the spirit of Huang-po's school became widespread south of the\r\nYangtze River.14\r\n\r\nThis exchange brings out the essence of Huang-po's concerns. His most\r\ninsistent conviction was that Ch'an cannot be taught, that it must be\r\nsomehow gained intuitively. He was contemptuous of conceptual thought,\r\nbelieving it to be the greatest hindrance to achieving intuitive\r\ninsight. The problem is the mistaken belief that Zen can somehow be\r\ntaught and understood if only one grasps the concepts. But concepts\r\nonly serve to obstruct intuition; Zen intuition can work only outside\r\nconcepts. As Huang-po phrased it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Since Zen was first transmitted, it has never taught that men should\r\nseek for learning or form concepts. \"Studying the Way\" is just a figure\r\nof speech. It is a method of arousing people's interest in the early\r\nstages of their development. In fact, the Way is not something which\r\ncan be studied. Study leads to the retention of concepts and so the Way\r\nis entirely misunderstood.15\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe use of the rational mind in the study of Ch'an is only meaningful\r\nat the beginning. But once the fish of intuitive insight has been\r\nsnared in the net of the rational mind's ken, the net must be\r\ndiscarded. Elsewhere he likens the extended use of analytical thought\r\nto the shoveling of dung.16 Concepts, it turns out, are only one of the\r\nmind's many constructs. The mind also provides our perception of\r\nconcrete objects, thereby \"creating\" them to suit its needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hills are hills. Water is water. Monks are monks. Laymen are laymen.\r\nBut these mountains, these rivers, the whole world itself, together\r\nwith the sun, moon, and stars--not one of them exists outside your\r\nminds! . . . Phenomena do not arise independently, but rely upon (the\r\nmental) environment (we create).17\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSince reality is created by the mind, we will never know what is \"real\"\r\nand what is illusion. Examples of this are commonplace. The electron is\r\nboth a wave and a particle, depending upon our point of view. Which is\r\n\"reality\"? Furthermore, concepts limit. By treating the world using\r\nrational constructs, we force it into a limited cage. But when we deal\r\nwith it directly, it is much more complex and authentic. To continue\r\nthe example, the electron may be something much more complex than\r\neither a wave or a particle, since it behaves at times like either or\r\nboth. It may in fact be something for which our rationality-bound mind\r\nhas no \"concept.\"\r\n\r\nThe illusory world we think we see around us, deceptively brought to us\r\nby our untrustworthy senses, leads us to conceptual thought and to\r\nlogical categories as a means to attempt its \"understanding.\" The\r\nresulting intellectual turmoil is just the opposite of the tranquility\r\nthat is Ch'an. But avoidance of conceptual thought leads to a serene,\r\ndirect, and meaningful understanding of the world around us, without\r\nunsettling mental involvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ordinary people all indulge in conceptual thought based on\r\nenvironmental phenomena, hence they feel desire and hatred. To\r\neliminate environmental phenomena, just put an end to your conceptual\r\nthinking. When this ceases, environmental phenomena are void; and when\r\nthese are void, thought ceases. But if you try to eliminate environment\r\nwithout first putting a stop to conceptual thought, you will not\r\nsucceed, but merely increase its power to disturb you.18\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nWhat is worse, reliance on misleading perception blocks out our\r\nexperience of our own pure mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_People in the world cannot identify their own mind. They believe that\r\nwhat they see, or hear, or feel, or know, is mind. They are blocked by\r\nthe visual, the auditory, the tactile, and the mental, so they cannot\r\nsee the brilliant spirit of their original mind.19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When he was asked why Zen students should not form concepts as other\r\npeople do, he replied, \"Concepts are related to the senses, and when\r\nfeeling takes place, wisdom is shut out.\"20 Huang-po is so adamant\r\nagainst the deceiving world of the senses he even comes down hard on\r\nthe pleasures of the gourmet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thus, there is sensual eating and wise eating. When the body suffers\r\nthe pangs of hunger and accordingly you provide it with food, but\r\nwithout greed, that is called wise eating. On the other hand, if you\r\ngluttonously delight in purity and flavour, you are permitting the\r\ndistinctions which arise from wrong thinking. Merely seeking to gratify\r\nthe organ of taste without realizing when you have taken enough is\r\ncalled sensual eating.21\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe point here seems to be that the use of the senses for pleasure is\r\nan abuse and distracts one from the illusion of the world, which itself\r\nobscures our mind from us. The ideal man he describes in terms of one\r\nwho can remain passive even when confronted by a manifestation of good\r\nor of evil. He commends the person who has the character to remain\r\naloof, even when in the Buddhist heaven or the Buddhist hell:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_If he should behold the glorious sight of all the Buddhas coming to\r\nwelcome him, surrounded by every kind of gorgeous manifestation, he\r\nwould feel no desire to approach them. If he should behold all sorts of\r\nhorrific forms surrounding him, he would experience no terror. He would\r\njust be himself, oblivious of conceptual thought and one with the\r\nAbsolute. He would have attained the state of unconditioned being.22\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nTruth is elusive. It is impossible to find it by looking for it. And\r\nthe world of the senses and the conceptual thought it engenders are\r\nactually impediments to discovering real truth. He provides an analogy\r\nin the story of a man who searches abroad for something that he had all\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suppose a warrior, forgetting that he was already wearing his pearl on\r\nhis forehead, were to seek for it elsewhere, he could\r\n\r\ntravel the whole world without finding it. But if someone who knew what\r\nwas wrong were to point it out to him, the warrior would immediately\r\nrealize that the pearl had been there all the time.23\r\n\r\n_He concludes that the warrior's finding his pearl had nothing to do\r\nwith his searching for it, just as the final realization of intuitive\r\nwisdom has nothing to do with the graduated practice of the traditional\r\nBuddhists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_So, if you students of the Way are mistaken about your own real Mind .\r\n. . you will indulge in various achievements and practices and expect\r\nto attain realization by such graduated practices. But, even after\r\naeons of diligent searching, you will not be able to attain to the Way.\r\nThese methods cannot be compared to the sudden elimination of\r\nconceptual thought, the certain knowledge that there is nothing at all\r\nwhich has absolute existence, nothing on which to lay hold, nothing on\r\nwhich to rely, nothing in which to abide, nothing subjective or\r\nobjective. It is by preventing the rise of conceptual thought that you\r\nwill realize Bodhi (enlightenment); and, when you do, you will just be\r\nrealizing the Buddha who has always existed in your own Mind!24\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe traditional practices neither help nor hinder finding the way,\r\nsince they are unrelated to the final flash of sudden enlightenment--\r\nwhich is in your mind from the beginning, ready to be released.\r\n\r\nWhat then did he teach, if there is nothing to be taught? The answer\r\nseems to be to stop seeking, for only then does wisdom come.\r\nFurthermore, to study a doctrine of nonattachment puts you in the\r\ncompromising position of becoming attached to nonattachment itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_If you students of the Way wish to become Buddhas, you need study no\r\ndoctrines whatever, but learn only how to avoid seeking for and\r\nattaching yourselves to anything. . . . Relinquishment of everything is\r\nthe Dharma, and he who understands this is a Buddha, but the\r\nrelinquishment of ALL delusions leaves no Dharma on which to lay hold.25\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBut just how does Huang-po manage to practice what he preaches?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_. . . [M]ost students of Zen cling to all sorts of sounds and forms.\r\nWhy do they not copy me by letting each thought go as though it were\r\nnothing, or as though it were a piece of rotten wood, a stone, or the\r\ncold ashes of a dead fire? Or else, by just making whatever slight\r\nresponse is suited to each occasion?26\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHis final admonitions were organized by Pei Hsiu and summarized in the\r\nfollowing list, reported as Huang-po's answer to the question of what\r\nguidance he had to offer those who found his teaching difficult.\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nI have NOTHING to offer. . . . All you need to remember are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nFirst, learn how to be entirely unreceptive to sensations arising from\r\nexternal forms, thereby purging your bodies of receptivity to\r\nexternals.\r\n\r\nSecond, learn not to pay attention to any distinctions between this and\r\nthat arising from your sensations, thereby purging your bodies of\r\nuseless discernments between one phenomenon and another.\r\n\r\nThird, take great care to avoid discriminating in terms of pleasant and\r\nunpleasant sensations, thereby purging your bodies of vain\r\ndiscriminations.\r\n\r\nFourth, avoid pondering things in your mind, thereby purging your\r\nbodies of discriminatory cognition.27\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHuang-po struggled mightily with the problem of transmission. Since the\r\ndoctrine was passed \"mind-to-mind,\" he was obliged to find a\r\ntransmission that somehow circumvented the need for words, something to\r\nbring a novice up against his own original nature. His contribution\r\nhere was not revolutionary: He mainly advocated the techniques\r\nperfected by Ma-tsu, including roars and shouts, beatings, calling out\r\na disciple's name unexpectedly, or just remaining silent at a critical\r\nmoment to underscore the inability of words to assist. He also used the\r\ntechnique of continually contradicting a pupil, until the pupil finally\r\nrealized that all his talking had been just so many obscuring concepts.\r\n\r\nBut just what was this mind that was being transmitted? His answer was\r\nthat nothing was transmitted, since the whole point was just to jar\r\nloose the intuition of the person being \"taught.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Once Huang-po was asked, \"If you say that mind can be transmitted,\r\nthen how can you say it is nothing?\" He answered, \"To achieve nothing\r\nis to have the mind transmitted to you.\" The questioner pressed, \"If\r\nthere is nothing and no mind, then how can it be transmitted?\" Huang-po\r\nanswered, \"You have heard the expression 'transmission of the mind' and\r\nso you think there must be something transmitted. You are wrong. Thus\r\nBodhidharma said that when the nature of the mind is realized, it is\r\nnot possible to express it verbally. Clearly, then, nothing is obtained\r\nin the transmission of the mind, or if anything is obtained, it is\r\ncertainly not knowledge_.\"28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe finally concludes that the subject cannot really even be discussed,\r\nsince there are no terms for the process that transpires. Just as\r\n_sunyata_--that \"emptiness\" or Void whose existence means that\r\nconceptual thought is empty and rational constructs inadequate--is not\r\nsomething that can be transmitted as a concept, so too is the Dharma or\r\nteaching, as well as Mind, that essence we share with a larger reality.\r\nEven statements that concepts are pointless must fall back on language\r\nand consequently are actually themselves merely make-do approximations,\r\nas are all descriptions of the process of transmission. He finally\r\ngives up on words entirely, declaring that none of the terms he has\r\nused has any meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A transmission of Void cannot be made through words. A transmission in\r\nconcrete terms cannot be the Dharma. . . In fact, however, Mind is not\r\nMind and transmission is not really transmission.29\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe was working on the very real problem of the transmission of\r\nunderstanding that operates in a part of the mind where speech and\r\nlogic cannot enter. As John Wu has pointed out, in a sense Huang-po had\r\ncome back full circle to the insights of Chuang Tzu: good and evil are\r\nmeaningless; intuitive knowledge is more profound than speech-bound\r\nlogic; there is an underlying unity (for Chuang Tzu it was the Tao or\r\nWay; for Huang-po, the Universal Mind) that represents the ineffable\r\nabsolute.30\r\n\r\nIn effect, Huang-po laid it all out, cleared the way, and defined Ch'an\r\nonce and for all. The Perennial Philosophy was never more strongly\r\nstated. The experimental age of Ch'an thus drew to a close, its job\r\nfinished. With his death at the midpoint of the ninth century, there\r\nwas little more to be invented.31 It was time now for Ch'an to formalize\r\nits dialectic, as well as to meet society and make its mark in the\r\nworld. The first was taken care of by Huang-po's star pupil, Lin-chi,\r\nand the second was precipitated by the forces of destiny.\r\n\r\nThe death of Huang-po coincided with a critical instant in Chinese\r\nhistory whose consequences for future generations were enormous. Once\r\nbefore Chinese politics had affected Ch'an, producing a situation in\r\nwhich Southern Ch'an would steal the march on Northern Ch'an. And now\r\nanother traumatic episode in Chinese affairs would effectively destroy\r\nall Buddhist sects except Southern Ch'an, leaving the way clear for\r\nthis pursuit of intuitive wisdom--once relegated to wandering teachers\r\nof _dhyana_--to become the only vital Buddhist sect left in China.\r\n\r\nAs noted previously, resentment toward Buddhism had always smoldered in\r\nChinese society. Periodically the conservative Chinese tried to drive\r\nthis foreign belief system from their soil, or failing that, at least\r\nto bring it under control. The usual complaints revolved around the\r\nmonasteries' holdings of tax-free lands, their removal of able-bodied\r\nmen and women from society into nonproductive monastic life, and the\r\nmonastic vows of celibacy so antithetical to the Chinese ideals of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe Ch'an monasteries, deliberately or not, worked hard to defuse many\r\nof these complaints. Indeed, some would say that Ch'an managed to\r\nchange Buddhism into something the Chinese could partially stomach.\r\nCh'anists were just the opposite of parasitical on society, since they\r\npracticed Po-chang Huai-hai's injunction of a day without work being a\r\nday without food. Also, the unthinking piety of traditional Buddhists\r\nwas reviled by Ch'anists. Furthermore, Ch'an dispensed with much of the\r\nrigmarole and paraphernalia favored by the Buddhist sects that stuck to\r\nits Indian origins more closely.\r\n\r\nThe resentment felt toward Buddhists was summarized in a document\r\nissued in 819 by a scholar-bureaucrat named Han Yu.32 His recital of\r\nBuddhism's failings came down particularly hard on the fact that the\r\nBuddha had not been Chinese. Han Yu advocated a complete suppression of\r\nthis pernicious establishment: \"Restore its people to human living!\r\nBurn its books! And convert its buildings to human dwellings!\"33 As\r\nresentment toward the worldly influence of Buddhism grew during the\r\nninth century, there came to power an emperor who decided to act.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Wu-tsang (r. 841-46) is now thought to have gone mad as a\r\nprelude to his persecution of the Buddhists. But his edicts were\r\neffective nonetheless. The state had begun tightening its grip on\r\nBuddhism when he came into power in 841, but in August 845 he issued\r\nthe edict that ultimately had the effect of destroying traditional\r\nBuddhism and urbanized Northern Ch'an in China. Over a period of two\r\nyears he destroyed 4,600 big temples and monasteries and over 40,000\r\nsmaller temples and retreats. He freed 150,000 male and female slaves\r\nor temple attendants and evicted some 265,000 monks and nuns, forcing\r\nthem back into secular life. (This was out of a total Chinese\r\npopulation estimated to be around 27 million.) And not incidentally,\r\nthe state reclaimed several million acres of property that had belonged\r\nto the monasteries. The effect of this was to obliterate virtually all\r\nthe great Buddhist establishments, including the Buddhist strongholds\r\nin the capitals of Chang-an and Loyang, which were reduced to only two\r\ntemples and thirty monks in each of the two cities.34\r\n\r\nThe irony of the Great Persecution was that it actually seemed to\r\ninvigorate Southern Ch'an. For one thing, these rural Ch'an teachers\r\nhad long been iconoclasts and outcasts themselves, as they disowned\r\nostentatious temples and even the scriptures. Almost as much a\r\nphilosophy as a religion, Southern Ch'an had long known how to do\r\nwithout imperial favor and largess. And when a further edict came down\r\ndemanding that all Buddhist paraphernalia, including statues and\r\npaintings, be burned, the outcast Ch'an monasteries had the least to\r\nlose, since they had even done a bit of burning themselves--if we are to\r\nbelieve the story of Tan-hsia (738-824), a famous Ch'an monk who once\r\nburned a Buddhist statue for warmth. Southern Ch'an teachers just\r\nmelted for a time back into secular life, from which they had never\r\nbeen far in any case.35\r\n\r\nThe result of all this was that after 846 the only sect of Buddhism\r\nwith any strength at all was rural Ch'an. Chinese Buddhism literally\r\nbecame synonymous with Southern Ch'an--a far cry from the almost\r\nfugitive existence of the sect in earlier years. And when Buddhism\r\nbecame fashionable again during the Sung, Southern Ch'an became a house\r\nreligion, as Northern had once been. The result was that Ch'an\r\ngradually lost its iconoclastic character. But out of this last phase\r\nof Ch'an developed one of the most powerful tools ever for\r\nenlightenment, the famous Zen koan, whose creation preserved something\r\nout of the dynamism of Ch'an's early centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTARIANISM AND THE KOAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . in which the Ch'an movement diversifies into a variety of\r\nschools, each beholden to a master or masters advocating an\r\nindividualized path to enlightenment. From this period of personality\r\nand experimentation gradually emerge two main Ch'an paths, the Lin-chi\r\nand the Ts'ao-tung (later called Rinzai and Soto in Japan). The Lin-chi\r\nschool concludes that enlightenment can be precipitated in a prepared\r\nnovice through shouts, jolts, and mental paradoxes. The Ts'ao-tung\r\nrelies more heavily on the traditional practice of meditation to\r\ngradually release enlightenment. The faith grows in numbers, but\r\nquality declines. To maintain Ch'an's intellectual vigor, there emerges\r\na new technique, called the koan, which uses episodes from Ch'an's\r\nGolden Age to challenge novices' mental complacency. This invention\r\nbecomes the hallmark of the later Lin-chi sect, and through the\r\nrefinement of the koan technique Ch'an enjoys a renaissance of\r\ncreativity in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Eleven\r\n\r\nLIN-CHI:\r\n\r\nFOUNDER OF RINZAI ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Persecution of 845 brought to a close the creative Golden Age\r\nof Ch'an, while also leaving Ch'an as the dominant form of Chinese\r\nBuddhism. In the absence of an establishment Buddhism for Ch'an to\r\ndistinguish itself against, the sect proceeded to evolve its own\r\ninternal sectarianism. There arose what are today known as the \"five\r\nhouses,\" regional versions of Ch'an that differed in minor but\r\nsignificant ways.1 Yet there was no animosity among the schools, merely\r\na friendly rivalry. In fact, the teachers themselves referred back to\r\nthe prophecy attributed to Bodhidharma that the flower of _dhyana_\r\nBuddhism would one day have five petals.\r\n\r\nThe masters who founded the five schools were all individualists of\r\nidiosyncratic character. Yet the times were such that for the most part\r\ntheir flowers bloomed gloriously only a few decades before slowly\r\nfading. However, two of the sects did prosper and eventually went on to\r\ntake over the garden. These two houses, the Lin-chi and the Ts'ao-tung,\r\nboth were concerned with dialectics and became the forerunners of the\r\ntwo Zen sects (Rinzai and Soto) eventually to flourish in Japan. Of the\r\ntwo, the Lin-chi is most directly traceable back to the earlier\r\nmasters, since its founder actually studied under the master Huang-po.\r\n\r\nThe master known today as Lin-chi (d. 866?) was born in the prefecture\r\nof Nan-hua, in what today is Shantung province.2 He reportedly was\r\nbrilliant, well behaved, and filled with the filial devotion expected\r\nof good Chinese boys. Drawn early to Buddhism, although not necessarily\r\nto Ch'an, he shaved his head and became a monk while still young. His\r\nearly studies were of the sutras, as well as the _vinaya_ or Buddhist\r\nrules and the _sastra_ or commentaries. But in his early twenties he\r\ndecided that he was\r\n\r\nmore interested in intuitive wisdom than orthodoxy and consequently\r\ntook the road in search of a master.\r\n\r\nThus he arrived at the monastery of Huang-po already a fully ordained\r\nmonk. But his learning was traditional and his personality that of a\r\ntimorous fledgling monk. For three years he dutifully attended the\r\nmaster's sermons and practiced all the observances of the mountain\r\ncommunity, but his advancement was minimal. Finally the head disciple\r\nsuggested that he visit Huang-po for an interview to try to gain\r\ninsight. The young man obligingly went in to see the master and asked\r\nhim the standard opener: \"What is the real meaning of Bodhidharma's\r\ncoming from the West?\" Huang-po's wordless response was to lay him low\r\nwith a blow of his stick.\r\n\r\nLin-chi scurried away in perplexity and related the story to the head\r\ndisciple, who encouraged him to return, which he did twice more. But\r\neach time he received the same harsh reception. He was finally so\r\ndemoralized that he announced plans to leave the monastery and seek\r\nenlightenment elsewhere. The head monk related this to Huang-po\r\ntogether with the opinion that this young novice showed significant\r\npromise. So when Lin-chi came to bid Huang-po farewell, the master\r\nsympathetically directed him to the monastery of a kindly nearby\r\nteacher, the master Ta-yu.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was all planned, but when Lin-chi arrived at the second\r\nmonastery and related his unhappy treatment at the hands of Huang-po\r\nthe master Ta-yu listened patiently and then declared, \"Huang-po\r\ntreated you with great compassion. He merely wanted to relieve your\r\ndistress.\" Upon hearing this Lin-chi suddenly understood that Huang-po\r\nwas transmitting the wordless insight to him, the understanding that\r\nCh'an lies not in the words produced in the abbot's room but rather in\r\nthe realization of his intuitive mind. It suddenly was all so obvious\r\nthat the young monk could not contain his joy and declared, \"So Huang-\r\npo's Buddhism is actually very simple; there's nothing to it after\r\nall!\" This struck the master Ta-yu as either impertinent or a\r\nsignificant breakthrough, so he grabbed Lin-chi and yelled, \"You scamp!\r\nA minute ago you complained that Huang-po's teaching was impossible to\r\nunderstand and now you say there is nothing to it. What is it you just\r\nrealized? Speak quickly!\" (Only in a spontaneous utterance is there\r\nreal, uncalculated evidence of enlightenment.)\r\n\r\nLin-chi's answer was to pummel Ta-yu in the ribs three times with his\r\nfist. The older master then discharged him (or perhaps kicked him out)\r\nwith the observation, \"Your teacher is Huang-po, and therefore you do\r\nnot concern me.\" Thus the enlightened young novice trudged back up the\r\nmountain to Huang-po's monastery. The master greeted him with the\r\npuzzled observation: \"Haven't you come back a bit too soon? You only\r\njust left.\" In response Lin-chi bowed and said, \"It's because you've\r\nbeen so kind to me that I came back so quickly,\" and he proceeded to\r\nrelate the story of his sudden enlightenment. To which Huang-po\r\ndeclared, \"What a big mouth that old man has. The next time I see him\r\nI'll give him a taste of my staff.\" To this Lin-chi yelled, \"Why wait!\r\nI can give it to you now,\" and proceeded to slap the master's face. The\r\nstartled Huang-po declared, \"This crazy monk is plucking the tiger's\r\nwhiskers.\" Whereupon Lin-chi emitted the first of what was to be a\r\nlifetime of shouts, affirming his wordless insight. The satisfied\r\nHuang-po called an attendant and said, \"Take this crazy fellow to the\r\nassembly hall.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a perfect example of \"sudden\" enlightenment that took many\r\nyears to achieve. Lin-chi had been a plodding, earnest young man until\r\nthe moment of his \"sudden\" enlightenment, which occurred over a\r\nseemingly uncalculated remark by a teacher not even his own master. In\r\nfact, all Huang-po had done was to assail him with a staff. But Lin-chi\r\nwas transformed suddenly from a milksop to the founder of a school,\r\nprobably the greatest radicalization since the Apostle Paul was struck\r\ndown on the road to Damascus.3 Still, Lin-chi's \"sudden\" enlightenment\r\nhad come about at the end of a highly disciplined period of\r\npreparation. As he later described it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In bygone days I devoted myself to the _vinaya_ and also delved into\r\nthe _sutras _and _sastras_. Later, when I realized that they were\r\nmedicines for salvation and displays of doctrines in written words, I\r\nonce and for all threw them away, and searching for the Way, I\r\npracticed meditation. Still later I met great teachers. Then it was,\r\nwith my Dharma Eye becoming clear, that I could discern all the old\r\nteachers under Heaven and tell the false ones from the true. It is not\r\nthat I understood from the moment I was born of my mother, but that,\r\nafter exhaustive investigation and grinding discipline, in an instant I\r\nknew of myself.4\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n        Like a reformed addict, he railed most against his own recent\r\npractices. He proceeded to denounce all the trappings of Buddhism, even\r\nthe Ch'an Patriarchs themselves, as he shattered the chains of his\r\nformer beliefs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Followers of the Way, if you want insight into Dharma as is, just\r\ndon't be taken in by the deluded views of others. Whatever you\r\nencounter, either within or without, slay it at once: on meeting a\r\nbuddha slay the buddha, on meeting a patriarch slay the patriarch, on\r\nmeeting an arhat slay the arhat, on meeting your parents slay your\r\nparents, on meeting your kinsman slay your kinsman, and you attain\r\nemancipation. By not cleaving to things, you freely pass through.5\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAfter his enlightenment, he had many exchanges with Huang-po in which\r\nhe came off ahead as often as not. It is also interesting that many of\r\nthe interactions involved the manual labor of the monastery, an\r\nindication of the significance of work in Ch'an life. One famous joust\r\nbetween Lin-chi and Huang-po went as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day Master Lin-chi went with Huang-po to do some work in which all\r\nthe monks participated. Lin-chi followed his master who, turning his\r\nhead, noticed that Lin-chi was carrying nothing in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your hoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody took it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come here: let us discuss something,\" commanded Huang-po and as Lin-\r\nchi drew nearer, he thrust his hoe into the ground and continued,\r\n\"There is no one in the world who can pick up my hoe.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, Lin-chi seized the tool, lifted it up, and exclaimed, \"How\r\nthen could it be in my hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Today we have another hand with us; it is not necessary for me to join\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Huang-po returned to the temple.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_        This story can be interpreted many ways. John Wu says,\r\n\"Obviously he was using the hoe as a pointer to the great function of\r\nteaching and transmitting the lamp of Ch'an. . . . [This was] a\r\nsymbolic way of saying that in a mysterious manner the charge was now\r\nin his hands.\"7 However, as Freud once remarked concerning the\r\ncelebrated phallic symbolism of his stogie, \"Sometimes, madam, it's\r\njust a cigar,\" and one suspects that in this little slapstick episode,\r\nthe hoe might possibly be just a hoe.\r\n\r\nAnother exchange between Huang-po and Lin-chi may have more dialectical\r\nsignificance. According to the story:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day Huang-po ordered all the monks of the temple to work in the\r\ntea garden. He himself was the last to arrive. Lin-chi greeted him, but\r\nstood there with his hands resting on the hoe.\r\n\r\n\"Are you tired?\" asked Huang-po\r\n\r\n\"I just started working; how can you say that I am tired?\"\r\n\r\nHuang-po immediately lifted his stick and struck Lin-chi, who then\r\nseized the stick, and with a push, made his master fall to the ground.\r\nHuang-po called the supervisor to help him up. After doing so, the\r\nsupervisor asked, \"Master, how can you let such a madman insult you\r\nlike that?\" Huang-po picked up the stick and struck the supervisor.\r\nLin-chi, digging the ground by himself, made this remark: \"Let all\r\nother places use cremation; here I will bury you alive._\"8_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nOf Lin-chi's final quip, which tends to take the edge off a really\r\nfirst-rate absurdist anecdote, John Wu makes the following observation,\r\n\"This was a tremendous utterance, the first authentic roaring, as it\r\nwere, of a young lion. It was tantamount to declaring that his old\r\nconventional self was now dead and buried, with only the True Self\r\nliving in him; that this death may and should take place long before\r\none's physical decease; that it is when this death has taken place that\r\none becomes one's True Self which, being unborn, cannot die. From that\r\ntime on, there could no longer be any doubt in Huang-po's mind that his\r\ndisciple was thoroughly enlightened, destined to carry on and brighten\r\nthe torch of Ch'an.\"9 Whether this is true or not, it does seem clear\r\nthat Lin-chi's pronounced personality appealed to old Huang-po, who\r\nloved to match wits with him as he came and went around the monastery.\r\nHe even allowed the young master liberties he denied others. For\r\nexample, Lin-chi once showed up during the middle of a summer\r\nmeditation retreat, something strictly forbidden. He then decided to\r\nleave before it was over, something equally unprecedented:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day after half the summer session had already passed, Lin-chi went\r\nup the mountain to visit his master Huang-po whom he found reading a\r\nsutra. Lin-chi said to him:\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were the perfect man, but here you are apparently a dull\r\nold monk, swallowing black beans [Chinese characters].\"\r\n\r\nLin-chi stayed only a few days and then bid farewell to Huang-po, who\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"You came here after the summer session had started, and now you are\r\nleaving before the summer session is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came here simply to visit you, Master!\"\r\n\r\nWithout ado, Huang-po struck him and chased him away. After having\r\nwalked a few li, Lin-chi began to doubt his enlightenment in Ch'an, so\r\nhe returned to Huang-po for the rest of the summer.10\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSome time after Lin-chi received the seal of enlightenment from Huang-\r\npo, he decided to go his own way and departed for the province of\r\nHopei, where he became the priest of a small temple on the banks of a\r\nriver. This little temple was called \"Overlooking the Ford,\" or _lin-\r\nchi_ in Chinese, and it was from this locale that he took his name.\r\nAfter he was there for a time, however, some local fighting broke out,\r\nforcing him to abandon his pastoral riverbank location. (This\r\ndisturbance may well have been connected with the disruptions of the\r\n845 persecution of Buddhism.) But even when in the middle of a war he\r\nseems to have always been a man of Ch'an. There is an episode that\r\nstrongly resembles the eighteenth-century essayist Dr. Samuel Johnson's\r\nkicking a stone to refute Berkeley's proposition that matter is\r\nnonexistent:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day the Master entered an army camp to attend a feast. At the gate\r\nhe saw a staff officer. Pointing to an open-air pillar, he asked: \"Is\r\nthis secular or sacred?\"\r\n\r\nThe officer had no reply.\r\n\r\nStriking the pillar, the Master said: \"Even if you could speak, this is\r\nstill only a wooden post.\" Then he went in.11\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nFortunately, Ch'an was not a sect that required a lot of paraphernalia,\r\nand Lin-chi merely moved into the nearby town, where the grand marshal\r\ndonated his house for a temple. He even hung up a plaque with the name\r\n\"Lin-chi,\" just to make the master feel at home. But things may have\r\nheated up too much, for Lin-chi later traveled south to the prefecture\r\nof Ho, where the governor, Counselor Wang, honored him as a master.\r\nThere is a telling conversation between the two that reveals much about\r\nthe teaching of Ch'an at the time. Apparently the Ch'anists had\r\ncompletely abandoned even any pretense of traditional Buddhism--again a\r\nfortuitous development, considering traditional Buddhism's imminent\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day the Counselor Wang visited the Master. When he met the Master\r\nin front of the Monks' Hall, he asked: \"Do the monks of this monastery\r\nread the sutras?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they don't read sutras,\" said the Master.\r\n\r\n\"Then do they learn meditation?\" asked the Counselor.\r\n\r\n\"No, they don't learn meditation,\" answered the Master.\r\n\r\n\"If they neither read sutras nor learn meditation, what in the world\r\nare they doing?\" asked the Counselor.\r\n\r\n\"All I do is make them become buddhas and patriarchs,\" said the\r\nMaster.12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nLin-chi eventually traveled on, finally settling at the Hsing-hua\r\ntemple in Taming prefecture, where he took up his final residence. It\r\nwas here that a record of his sermons was transcribed by a \"humble\r\nheir\" named Ts'un-chiang. The result was _The Record of Lin-chi_, one\r\nof the purest exercises in the dialectics of the nondialectical\r\nunderstanding. But, as Heinrich Dumoulin observed, \"Zen has never\r\nexisted in pure experience only, without admixture of theoretical\r\nteachings or methodical practice, as it has sometimes been idealized.\r\nIt could not exist in that fashion, for mysticism, like all other human\r\nexperience, is dependent on the actual conditions of human life.\"13\r\nIndeed, Lin-chi was one of the first to develop what might be called a\r\ndialectic of irrationality. He loved categories and analysis in the\r\nservice of nonconceptual inquiry, and what he created were guides to\r\nthe uncharted seas of the intuitive mind.\r\n\r\nLin-chi is best known for his use of the shout. He shared the concern\r\nof Huang-po and Ma-tsu with the problem of wordless transmission and to\r\ntheir repertory of beatings and silences he added the yell, another way\r\nto affirm insights that cannot be reasoned. We may speculate that the\r\nshout was rather like a watered-down version of the beating, requiring\r\nless effort but still able to startle at a critical instant.14 He seems\r\nto have been particularly fond of classifying things into groups of\r\nfour, and one of his most famous classifications was of the shout\r\nitself. He once demonstrated the shout to a hapless monk as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Master asked a monk: \"Sometimes a shout is like the jeweled sword\r\nof a spirit King [i.e., extremely hard and durable]; sometimes a shout\r\nis like the golden-haired lion crouching on the ground [i.e., strong,\r\ntaut, and powerful]; sometimes a shout is like a weed-tipped fishing\r\npole [i.e., probing and attracting the unwary]; and sometimes a shout\r\ndoesn't function as a shout. How do you understand this?\"\r\n\r\nAs the monk fumbled for an answer, Lin-chi gave a shout.15\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHis philosophy of the shout as a device for cutting off sequential\r\nreasoning was thus demonstrated by example. But the question those who\r\nrelate this story never resolve is: Which of the four shouts was the\r\nshout he used on the student? [John Wu in _The Golden Age of Zen\r\n_speculates that this shout was of the first category, since it was\r\nmeant to \"cut off\" the monk's sequential thought, but that seems a\r\nrather simplistic mixing of the metaphorical with the concrete.16)\r\n\r\n        Lin-chi also was not averse to the use of the stick in the\r\npursuit of reality, as the following example illustrates. The story\r\nalso shows that the use of the stick was meaningful only if it was\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Once the Master addressed the assembly.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, all of you! He who wants to learn Dharma must never worry\r\nabout the loss of his own life. When I was with Master Huang-po I asked\r\nthree times for the real meaning of Buddhism, and three times I was\r\nstruck as if tall reeds whipped me in the wind. I want those blows\r\nagain, but who can give them to me now?\"\r\n\r\nA monk came forth from the crowd, answering: \"I can give them to you!\"\r\n\r\nMaster Lin-chi picked up a stick and handed it to him. When the monk\r\ntried to grab it, the Master struck him instead.17\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThere also is a story indicating that Lin-chi believed that when the\r\nshout failed to work, the stick might be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Master took the high seat in the Hall. A monk asked, \"What about\r\nthe cardinal principle of the Buddha-dharma?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master raised his whisk.\r\n\r\nThe monk shouted. The Master struck him.\r\n\r\nAnother monk asked: \"What about the cardinal principle of the Buddha-\r\ndharma?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the Master raised his whisk.\r\n\r\nThe monk shouted. The Master also shouted.\r\n\r\nThe monk faltered; the Master struck him.18\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nYet another series of exchanges sounds a similar theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Master asked a monk, \"Where do you come from?\"\r\n\r\nThe monk shouted.\r\n\r\nThe master saluted him and motioned him to sit down. The monk\r\nhestitated. The Master hit him.\r\n\r\nSeeing another monk coming, the Master raised his whisk.\r\n\r\nThe monk bowed low. The Master hit him.\r\n\r\nSeeing still another monk coming, the Master again raised his whisk.\r\nThe monk paid no attention. The Master hit him too.19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_He was also challenged by a nun, one of the few recorded\r\n\r\ninstances of a master actually matching wits with a woman who had taken\r\nCh'an orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Master asked a nun: \"Well-come or ill-come?\"\r\n\r\nThe nun shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, go on, speak!\" cried the Master, taking up his stick.\r\n\r\nAgain the nun shouted. The Master hit her.20\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nWhat Lin-chi also brought to Ch'an was a dialectical inquiry into the\r\nrelationship between master and pupil, together with a similar analysis\r\nof the mind states that lead to enlightenment. He seems remarkably\r\nsophisticated for the ninth century, and indeed we would be hard\r\npressed to find this kind of psychological analysis anywhere in the\r\nWest that early. The puzzling, contradictory quality about all this is\r\nthat Lin-chi believed fervently in intuitive intelligence, and in the\r\nuselessness of words--even warning that questions were irrelevant:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Does anyone have a question? If so, let him ask it now. But the\r\ninstant you open your mouth you are already way off.21\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAmong his dialectical creations were various fourfold categorizations\r\nof the intangible. We have already seen his four categories of the\r\nshout. He also created the four categories of relationship between\r\nsubject and object, also sometimes called the Four Processes of\r\nLiberation from Subjectivity and Objectivity. Some believe this served\r\nto structure the \"four standpoints or points of view which Lin-chi used\r\nin instructing his students.\"22 Lin-chi's original proposition, the\r\nbasis of all the later commentary, is provided in _The Record of Lin-\r\nchi _as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_At the evening gathering the Master addressed the assembly, saying:\r\n\"Sometimes I take away man and do not take away the surroundings;\r\nsometimes I take away the surroundings and do not take away man;\r\nsometimes I take away both man and the surroundings; sometimes I take\r\naway neither man nor the surroundings._\"23_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_As Chang Chung-yuan describes these four arrangements, the first is to\r\n\"take away the man but not his objective situation,\" i.e., to take away\r\nall interpretation and just experience the world without subjective\r\nassociations.24 (This is quite similar to the approach of the Japanese\r\nhaiku poem, in which a description of something is provided completely\r\ndevoid of interpretation or explicit emotional response.)\r\n\r\nThe second arrangement is to let the man remain but take away\r\nobjectivity. As John Wu interprets this, \"In the second stage, people\r\nof normal vision, who see mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers,\r\nmust be reminded of the part that their own mind contributes to the\r\nappearance of things, and that what they naively take for objectivity\r\nis inextricably mixed with subjectivity. Once aware of subjectivity,\r\none is initiated into the first stages of Ch'an, when one no longer\r\nsees mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers.\"25 This is merely the\r\nCh'an commonplace that \"non-attachment or objectivity liberates one's\r\nself from bondage to the outside and thus leads to enlightenment.\"26 As\r\nDumoulin describes these, \"In the first and second stages, illusion\r\ndeparts first from the subject and then from the object; clinging to\r\nsubjective intellectual perception and to the objective world is\r\novercome.\"27\r\n\r\nLin-chi's third stage is to \"take away both the man and his objective\r\nsituation. In other words, it is liberation from . . . the attachments\r\nof both subjectivity and objectivity. Lin-chi's famous 'Ho!' . . .\r\noften served this purpose.\"28 In a blow of a master's staff or a shout\r\nthere is nothing one can grasp, either objectively or subjectively.\r\nThis is the next-to-last stage in the progression toward liberation\r\nfrom the mind's tyranny.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth stage we find the final condition, in which objectivity\r\nand subjectivity cease to be distinguishable. What this means is that\r\nthere is no intellectuation at all, that the world simply is. As\r\nDumoulin declares, \"reality is comprehended in its final oneness.\"29 Or\r\nas the story says: Before enlightenment, mountains are mountains and\r\nrivers are rivers; during the study of Zen, mountains are not mountains\r\nand rivers are not rivers; but when there finally is enlightenment,\r\nmountains are again mountains and rivers are rivers. In this final\r\nstate the distinction and confrontation of subject and object dissolve,\r\nas we are finally at one with the nameless world.\r\n\r\nAnother of Lin-chi's famous dialectical categories is his \"Fourfold\r\nRelationship possible Between Questioner and Answerer or Between Guest\r\nand Host.\" The point of the structure he sets up is to elucidate the\r\ninteraction of master and novice, but he does so using metaphor of host\r\nand guest--where the host represents the universal Self and the guest\r\nthe ego-form self.30 Lin-chi's sermon on the subject went as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A true student gives a shout, and to start with holds out a\r\n\r\nsticky lacquer tray. The teacher, not discerning that this is an\r\n\r\nobjective circumstance, goes after it and performs a lot of antics with\r\nit. The student again shouts but still the teacher is unwilling to let\r\ngo. This is . . . called \"the guest examines the host.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes a teacher will proffer nothing, but the instant a student\r\nasks a question, robs him of it. The student, having been robbed,\r\nresists to the death and will not let go; this is called \"the host\r\nexamines the guest.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes a student comes forth before a teacher in conformity with a\r\nstate of purity. The teacher, discerning that this is an objective\r\ncircumstance, seizes it and flings it into a pit. \"What an excellent\r\nteacher!\" exclaims the student, and the teacher replies, \"Bah! You\r\ncan't tell good from bad!\" Thereupon the student makes a deep bow; this\r\nis called \"the host examines the host.\"\r\n\r\nOr again, a student will appear before a teacher wearing a cangue and\r\nbound with chains. The teacher fastens on still more chains and cangues\r\nfor him. The student is so delighted that he can't tell what is what:\r\nthis is called \"the guest examines the guest._\"31_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the first category, according to Chang Chung-yuan, the ego meets\r\nthe universal Self.32 In the second category the universal Self\r\nencounters the ego-form self. In the third category, the universal Self\r\nof one meets the universal Self of another, and in the fourth category\r\nthe ego of one encounters the ego of another. Or if we are to interpret\r\nthis in the concrete, in the first encounter, an enlightened master\r\nmeets an unenlightened novice; in the second an enlightened novice\r\nmeets an unenlightened master (which did happen); in the third an\r\nenlightened master meets an enlightened novice; and in the fourth\r\ncategory an unenlightened master meets an unenlightened novice, to the\r\nmutual delusion of both.33\r\n\r\nLin-chi has been called the most powerful master in the entire history\r\nof Ch'an, and not without reason. His mind was capable of operating at\r\nseveral levels simultaneously, enabling him to overlay very practical\r\ninstruction with a comprehensive dialectic. He believed in complete\r\nspontaneity, total freedom of thought and deed, and a teaching approach\r\nthat has been called the \"lightning\" method--because it was swift and\r\nunpredictable. He was uncompromising in his approach, and he was also\r\nextremely critical of the state of Ch'an in his time--a criticism\r\nprobably justified. He found both monks and masters wanting. It seems\r\nthat Ch' an had become fashionable, with the result that there were\r\n\r\nmany masters who were more followers of the trend than followers of the\r\nWay. So whereas Huang-po often railed against other sects of Buddhism,\r\nLin-chi reserved his ire for other followers of Ch'an (there being few\r\nother Buddhist sects left to criticize).\r\n\r\nHe even denounced his own students, who often mimicked his shouting\r\nwithout perceiving his discernment in its use. He finally had to set\r\nstandards for this, announcing to the assembly one day that henceforth\r\nonly those who could tell the enlightened from the unenlightened would\r\nhave the right to shout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_        \"You all imitate my shouting,\" he said, \"but let me give you a\r\ntest now. One person comes out from the eastern hall. Another person\r\ncomes out from the western hall. At their meeting, they simultaneously\r\nshout. Do you possess enough discernment to distinguish the guest from\r\nthe host [i.e., the unenlightened from the enlightened]? If you have no\r\nsuch discernment, you are forbidden hereafter to imitate my shouting.34\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHis major concern seems to have been that his students resist\r\nintellection. Lin-chi himself was able to speculate philosophically\r\nwhile still a natural man, using conceptual thought only when it served\r\nhis purpose. But perhaps his students could not, for he constantly had\r\nto remind them that striving and learning were counterproductive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        _\"Followers of Tao!\" Lin-chi said, \"the way of Buddhism admits\r\nof no artificial effort; it only consists in doing the ordinary things\r\nwithout any fuss--going to the stool, making water, putting on clothes,\r\ntaking a meal, sleeping when tired. Let the fools laugh at me. Only the\r\nwise know what I mean._\"35_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Or as he said at another time:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The moment a student blinks his eyes, he's already way off. The moment\r\nhe tries to think, he's already differed. The moment he arouses a\r\nthought, he's already deviated. But for the man who understands, it's\r\nalways right here before his eyes.36\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe problem, he believed, was that too many teachers had started\r\n\"teaching\" and explaining rather than forcing students to experience\r\ntruth for themselves. Thus these teachers had no right\r\n\r\nto criticize their monks, since they themselves had failed in their\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_There are teachers all around who can't distinguish the false from the\r\ntrue. When students come asking about . . . the [objective]\r\nsurroundings and the [subjective] mind, the blind old teachers\r\nimmediately start explaining to them. When they're railed at by the\r\nstudents they grab their sticks and hit them, [shouting], \"What\r\ninsolent talk!\" Obviously you teachers yourselves are without an eye so\r\nyou've no right to get angry with them.37\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAnd finally, in his old age, Lin-chi became something of a monument\r\nhimself, a testing point for enlightenment in a world where true\r\nteachers were rare. He even complained about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hearing everywhere of old man Lin-chi, you come here intending to bait\r\nme with difficult questions and make it impossible for me to answer.\r\nFaced with a demonstration of the activity of my whole body, you\r\nstudents just stare blankly and can't move your mouths at all; you're\r\nat such a loss you don't know how to answer me. You go around\r\neverywhere thumping your own chests and whacking your own ribs, saying,\r\n\"I understand Ch'an! I understand the Way!\" But let two or three of you\r\ncome here and you can't do a thing. Bah! Carrying that body and mind of\r\nyours, you go around everywhere flapping your lips like winnowing fans\r\nand deceiving villagers.38\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_His school prospered, becoming the leading expression of Ch'an in\r\nChina as well as a vital force in the Zen that later arose among\r\nJapan's samurai. And his dialectical teachings became the philosophical\r\nbasis for later Zen, something he himself probably would have deplored.\r\n(Later teachers seem to have given Lin-chi's categories more importance\r\nthan he actually intended, for he professed to loathe systems and was\r\nin fact much more concerned with enlightenment as pure experience.) In\r\nany case, when he decided that his days were through he put on his\r\nfinest robes, seated himself in the meditation posture, made a brief\r\nstatement, and passed on. The year is said to have been 866 or 867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Twelve\r\n\r\nTUNG-SHAN AND TS'AO-SHAN:\r\n\r\n       FOUNDERS OF SOTO ZEN\r\n\r\n_Tung-shan_\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtually all the masters encountered up to this point have been\r\ntraceable to Ma-tsu, descendant in Dharma of the legendary Huai-jang\r\nand his master, the Sixth Patriarch, Hui-neng. This was the line that\r\nbecame Japanese Rinzai Zen, many centuries later. However, Hui-neng had\r\nanother follower, a shadowy figure remembered as Ch'ing-yuan Hsing-ssu\r\n(d. 740) whose line also was perpetuated to present-day Japan.1 His\r\nforemost pupil was Shih-t'ou (700-90), and a common description of the\r\neighth-cen- tury Ch'an establishment was: \"In Kiangsi the master was\r\nMa-tsu; in Hunan the master was Shih-t'ou. People went back and forth\r\nbetween them all the time, and those who never met these two great\r\nmasters were completely ignorant.\"2 Shih-t'ou jousted with Ma-tsu, and\r\nthey often swapped students. Ma-tsu sent his pupils on their way with a\r\nwink and the advice that Shih-t'ou was \"slippery.\"3 This legendary\r\nmaster was forebear of three of the five \"houses\" of Ch'an arising\r\nafter the Great Persecution of 845, although the only one of the three\r\nsurviving is the Ts'ao-tung, which arose during the later T'ang (618-\r\n907) and early Five Dynasties (907-960) period and remains today as\r\nJapanese Soto.\r\n\r\nOne of the cofounders of the Ts'ao-tung house was known as Tung-shan\r\nLiang-chieh (807-869), who was born in present day Chekiang but\r\neventually found his way to what is now northern Kiangsi province.4 As\r\ndid most great masters, he took Buddhist orders early, and one of the\r\nmost enduring stories of his life has him confounding his elders--an\r\nevent common to many spiritual biographies. He began as a novice in the\r\nVinaya sect, an\r\n\r\norganization often more concerned with the letter of the law than its\r\nspirit. One day he was asked to recite the Heart Sutra, but when he\r\ncame to the phrase \"There is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind,\"\r\nhe wonderingly touched his own face and then inquired of his master, \"I\r\nhave eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and so forth; how, then, can the sutra\r\nsay there are no such things?\"5 The Vinaya master was dumbfounded by his\r\niconoclasm and suggested that his bent of mind would be more readily\r\ncultivated in the Ch'an sect. So off he went to Mt. Sung, where he\r\nsubsequently was ordained at the precocious age of twenty-one.\r\n\r\nAfterward he traveled across China, typical for young monks of the age.\r\nIronically enough, considering that his line eventually rivaled Ma-\r\ntsu's, his first stop was the monastery of Nan-ch'uan, one of the\r\nforemost disciples of Ma-tsu. As he arrived, Nan-ch'uan was announcing\r\na memorial service to be conducted the next day on the anniversary of\r\nhis master's death, a standard Chinese custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nan-ch'uan remarked, \"When we serve food for Master Ma-tsu tomorrow, I\r\ndo wonder whether he will come for it.\" None of the monks made a reply\r\nbut [Tung-shan] came forth out of the crowd and said, \"As soon as he\r\nhas companions he will come.\" Hearing this, Nan-ch'uan praised him:\r\n\"Although this man is young, he is worthy of being trained.'' [Tung-\r\nshan] said to him, \"Master, you should not make a slave out of an\r\nhonorable person._\"6_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tung-shan studied briefly with Nan-ch'uan making a name for himself in\r\nthe process and then traveled on. He later landed at the monastery of a\r\nteacher named Yun-yen, but after a successful period of study he\r\nannounced his intention to again continue down the road. Yun-yen,\r\nhowever, protested losing his star pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"After you leave here, it will be very hard for us to see each other\r\nagain,\" said Master Yun-yen.\r\n\r\n\"It will be very hard for us not to see each other again,\" answered\r\n[Tung-shan]. . . . Then Yun-yen said to him, \"You must be very careful,\r\nas you are carrying this great thing.\"\r\n\r\n[Tung-shan] was puzzled. Later when he was crossing the water and saw\r\nhis image reflected, he suddenly understood the teaching of Yun-yen.7\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBy the year 860 Tung-shan had a monastery of his own and was besieged\r\nby disciples. He subsequently moved to Tung-shan (Mt. Tung) in what is\r\ntoday Kiangsi province, the locale that provided his historic name. His\r\nrespect for Yun-yen's enigmatic wisdom was explained years later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day, when the Master was conducting the annual memorial service\r\nfor Master Yun-yen, a monk asked him:\r\n\r\n\"What instruction did you receive from the late Master Yun-yen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Although I was there with him, he gave me no instruction,\" answered\r\nthe Master.\r\n\r\n\"Then why should you conduct the memorial service for him, if he did\r\nnot instruct you?\" persisted the monk. . . .\r\n\r\n\"It is neither for his moral character nor his teaching of Dharma that\r\nI respect him. What I consider important is that he never told me\r\nanything openly._\"8_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nYet Tung-shan does not seem completely against the cultivation of\r\nenlightenment, as were some of the other, more radical Ch'anists. Take,\r\nfor example, the following reported encounter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A government officer wanted to know whether there was anyone\r\napproaching Ch'an through cultivation. The Master answered: \"When you\r\nbecome a laborer, then there will be someone to do cultivation._\"9_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe officer's question would have elicited a shout from Lin-chi, a blow\r\nfrom Huang-po, and advice from Chao-chou to go wash his rice bowl.\r\n\r\nAlthough Tung-shan may have avoided the deliberate absurdities of the\r\nLin-chi masters, his utterances are often puzzling nonetheless. Part of\r\nthe reason is that he preferred the metaphor to the concrete example.\r\nUnlike the repartee of the absurdist Lin-chi masters, his exchanges are\r\nnot deliberately illogical. Instead we find a simple reluctance to say\r\nanything straight. But if you follow the symbolic language, you realize\r\nit is merely another clever way of never teaching with words, while\r\nstill using language. His frequent speaking in metaphors can be\r\nappreciated by the following exchange, which uses language emeshed in\r\nsymbols.\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nMonk: \"With what man of Tao should one associate, so that one will hear\r\nconstantly what one has never heard?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master: \"That which is under the same coverlet with you.\"\r\n\r\nMonk: \"This is still what you, Master, can hear yourself. What is it\r\nthat one will hear constantly which one has never heard?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master: \"It is not the same as wood and stone.\" . . .\r\n\r\n Monk: \"Who is he in our country that holds a sword in his hand?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master: \"It is Ts'ao-shan.\"\r\n\r\nMonk: \"Whom do you want to kill?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master: \"All those who are alive will die.\"\r\n\r\nMonk: \"When you happen to meet your parents, what should\r\n\r\nyou do?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master: \"Why should you have any choice?\"\r\n\r\nMonk: \"How about yourself?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master: \"Who can do anything to me?\"\r\n\r\nMonk: \"Why should you not kill yourself, too?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master: \"There is no place on which I can lay my hands._\"10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ch'an teachers deliberately avoided specifics, since these might\r\ncause students to start worrying about the precise definition of words\r\nand end up bogged down in conceptual quandries, neglecting their real\r\nnature--which cannot be reached using words.11 But further than this, the\r\nmonk thinks he will trap the master by asking him if his injunction to\r\nkill includes his own parents. (Remember Lin-chi's \"On meeting your\r\nparents, slay your parents.\") But Tung-shan answered by accusing the\r\nmonk--indirectly--of making discriminations. As for self-murder, Tung-\r\nshan maintains his immaterial self-nature is indestructible.12\r\n\r\nThe dialectic of Tung-shan, subsequently elaborated by his star pupil,\r\nTs'ao-shan, represents one of the last great expressions of Chinese\r\nmetaphysical thought. He defined a system of five positions or\r\nrelations between the Particular or Relative and the Universal or\r\nAbsolute, defined as follows.13\r\n\r\nIn the first state, called the Universal within the Particular, the\r\nAbsolute is hidden and obscured by our preoccupation with the world of\r\nappearances. However, the world of appearances is in fact a part of the\r\nlarger world of Absolute reality. When we have achieved a true\r\nunderstanding of the objective world we realize that it is no more real\r\nthan our senses make it, and consequently it represents not absolute\r\nreality but merely our perception. This realization leads to the second\r\nphase.\r\n\r\nIn the second state, called the Particular within the Universal, we\r\nrecognize that objective reality must always be perceived through our\r\nsubjective apparatus, just as the Absolute must be approached through\r\nthe relative, since all particularities merely exemplify the Absolute.\r\nEven good and bad are part of this same Universality. It is all real,\r\nbut simply that--no values are attached, since it is all part of\r\nexistence. This, says the scholar John Wu, is the state of\r\nenlightenment.14\r\n\r\nIn dialectical terms, this rounds out the comparison of the Particular\r\nand the Universal, with each shown to be part of the other. But they\r\nmust ultimately be resolved back into sunyata, the Void that\r\nencompasses everything. Neither the Universal or Absolute, nor the\r\nparticulars that give it physical form, are the ultimate reality. They\r\nboth are merely systems in the all-encompassing Void.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth stages he defines exemplify achieving\r\nenlightenment by Universality alone and achieving enlightenment by\r\nParticularity alone. The third stage, enlightenment through\r\nUniversality, leads one to meditate on the Absolute, upon the single\r\nwordless truth that defines the particular around us as part of itself.\r\n(It sounds remarkably similar to the Tao.) This meditation is done\r\nwithout props, language, or any of the physical world (the particular)\r\nsurrounding us.\r\n\r\nEnlightenment through the Particular, through experience with the\r\nphenomenal world, was the fourth stage. This received the most\r\nattention from the Lin-chi sect--whose masters would answer the question\r\n\"What is the meaning of Ch'an?\" with \"The cypress tree in the\r\ncourtyard\" or \"Three pounds of flax.\"15\r\n\r\nAt the fifth stage, enlightenment reaches the Void, the state that\r\ncannot be contained in a concept, since all concepts are inside it.\r\nWhen you finally reach this state of wordless insight, you realize that\r\nboth words and wordlessness are merely part of this larger reality.\r\nAction and nonaction are equally legitimate responses to the world.\r\nTung-shan demonstrated this when he was asked, \"When a snake is\r\nswallowing a frog, should you save the frog's life?\" To this he\r\nanswered, \"To save the frog is to be blind [i.e., to ultimate oneness\r\nand therefore to discriminate between frog and snake]; not to save the\r\nfrog is not to let form and shadow appear [i.e., to ignore the\r\nphenomena].16 Perhaps Tung-shan was demonstrating that he was free of\r\ndiscrimination between either option.17\r\n\r\nThe question of the subjective and the objective, the Universal and the\r\nParticular, permeated Tung-shan's teachings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Once the Master asked a monk what his name was. The monk answered that\r\nhis name was so-and-so. The Master then asked: \"What one is your real\r\nself?\"\r\n\r\n\"The one who is just facing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity! What a pity! The men of the present day are all like\r\nthis. They take what is in the front of an ass or at the back of a\r\nhorse and call it themselves. This illustrates the downfall of\r\nBuddhism. If you cannot recognize your real self objectively, how can\r\nyou see your real self subjectively?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you see your real self subjectively?\" the monk immediately\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"You have to tell me that yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were to tell you myself, it would be seeing myself objectively.\r\nWhat is the self that is known subjectively?\"\r\n\r\n\"To talk about it in such a way is easy to do, but to continue our\r\ntalking makes it impossible to reach the truth._\"18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere also is a poem, known as the Pao-ching San-mei, traditionally\r\nattributed to Tung-shan.19 One quatrain will give the flavor of the\r\nverse:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The man of wood sings,\r\n\r\nThe woman of stone gets up and dances,\r\n\r\nThis cannot be done by passion or learning,\r\n\r\nIt cannot be done by reasoning._20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been interpreted as the idea of Universality penetrating into\r\nParticularity. The wooden man singing and the stone maiden dancing are\r\nexplained as evidence of the power of Universality.21 Tung-shan had a\r\nnumber of distinguishing qualities. He often used Taoist language in\r\nhis teachings, quoting Chuang Tzu to make a point. Reportedly he never\r\nused the shout or the stick to shock a novice into self-awareness. And\r\nwhereas his dialogues often used metaphors that at first appear\r\nobscure, there are never the deliberate absurdities of the Lin-chi\r\nmasters, who frequently answered a perfectly reasonable question with a\r\ndeliberate inanity merely to demonstrate the absurdity of words. Unlike\r\nthe Lin-chi masters, he seems less concerned with the process of\r\ntransmission than with what exactly is transmitted. Tung-shan viewed\r\nwords as did Chuang Tzu, namely as the net in which to catch the fish.\r\nWhereas the Lin-chi masters viewed enlightenment as a totality, Tung-\r\nshan teachers believed that enlightenment arrived in stages, and they\r\nwere concerned with identifying what these stages were. This was, in\r\nfact, the purpose of his five categories of Particularity and\r\nUniversality, which became a part of the historic dialectic of Zen\r\nenlightenment. Ironically, with the emergence of the idea of stages, we\r\nseem back to a concept of \"gradual\" enlightenment--arrived at because\r\nthe Chinese mind could not resist theoretical speculations.\r\n\r\nTung-shan's deathbed scene was almost worthy of comic opera. One day in\r\nthe third month of 869 he made known his resolve to die and, shaving\r\nhis head and donning his formal robes, ordered the gong to be struck as\r\nhe seated himself in meditation. But his disciples began sobbing so\r\ndisturbingly that he finally despaired of dying in peace and, opening\r\nhis eyes, chided them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Those who are Buddhists should not attach themselves to externalities.\r\nThis is the real self-cultivation. In living they work hard; in death\r\nthey are at rest. Why should there be any grief?_22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then instructed the head monk to prepare \"offerings of food to\r\nignorance\" for everyone at the monastery, intending to shame all those\r\nwho still clung to the emotions of the flesh. The monks took a full\r\nweek to prepare the meal, knowing it was to be his last supper. And\r\nsure enough, upon dining he bade them farewell and, after a ceremonial\r\nbath, passed on.\r\n\r\nThe most famous disciple of Tung-shan, Master Ts'ao-shan (840-901), was\r\nborn as Pen-chi on the Fukien coast. Passing through an early interest\r\nin Confucianism, he left home at nineteen and became a Buddhist. He was\r\nordained at age twenty-five and seems to have found frequent occasion\r\nto Visit Tung-shan. Then one day they had an encounter that catapulted\r\nTs'ao-shan into the position of favored pupil. The exchange began with\r\na question by Tung-shan:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"What is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is [Ts'ao-shan].\"\r\n\r\n\"Say something toward Ultimate Reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not say anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you speak of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not called [Ts'ao-shan]._\"23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that Tung-shan gave Ts'ao-shan private instruction after\r\nthis and regarded his capability highly. The anecdote, if we may\r\nventure a guess, seems to assert that the Universal cannot be reached\r\nthrough language, and hence he could only converse about his objective,\r\nphysical form.\r\n\r\nAfter several years of study, Ts'ao-shan decided to strike out on his\r\nown, and he announced this intention to Tung-shan. The older master\r\nthen inquired:\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I go where it is changeless.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you go where it is changeless?\"\r\n\r\n\"My going is no change._\"24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTs'ao-shan subsequently left his master and went wandering and\r\nteaching. Finally, in late summer of 901, the story says that Ts'ao-\r\nshan one evening inquired about the date, and early the next morning he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nAlthough the recorded exchanges between Tung-shan and Ts'ao-shan are\r\nlimited to the two rather brief encounters given, the younger master\r\nactually seems to have been the moving force behind the dialectical\r\nconstructions of the Ts'ao-tung school. The ancient records, such as\r\n_The Transmission of the Lamp_, all declare that Ts'ao-shan was\r\ninspired by the Five States of Universality and Particularity to become\r\na great Buddhist. As Dumoulin judges, \"It was [Ts'ao-shan] who first,\r\nin the spirit of and in accordance with the master's teachings,\r\narranged the five ranks in their transmuted form and explained them in\r\nmany ways. . . . The fundamental principles, however, stem from [Tung-\r\nshan], who for that reason must be considered to be their originator.\"25\r\n\r\nThe ultimate concern of both the Ts'ao-tung and Lin-chi doctrines was\r\nenlightenment. The difference was that Ts'ao-tung masters believed\r\nquiet meditation was the way, rather than the mind-shattering\r\ntechniques of Lin-chi. Ts'ao-tung (Soto Zen) strives to soothe the\r\nspirit rather than deliberately instigate psychic turmoil, as sometimes\r\ndoes the Lin-chi (Rinzai). The aim is to be in the world but not of it;\r\nto occupy the physical world but transcend it mentally, aloof and\r\nserene.\r\n\r\nA further difference has been identified by the British scholar Sir\r\nCharles Eliot, who concludes that whereas Lin-chi \"regards the\r\nknowledge of the Buddha nature ... as an end in itself, all-satisfying\r\nand all-engrossing, the [Ts'ao-tung] . . . held that it is necessary to\r\nhave enlightenment after Enlightenment, that is to say that the inner\r\nillumination must display itself in a good life.\"26 Thus Eliot suggests\r\nthe Ts'ao-tung took something of an interest in what you do, in\r\ndistinction to the Lin-chi school, which preferred to focus on inner\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nThe Ts'ao-tung sect, at least in its early forms, was fully as\r\ndialectical in outlook as was the Lin-chi. In this it was merely\r\ncarrying on, to some extent, the example of its forebear Shih-t'ou, who\r\nwas himself remembered as deeply interested in theoretical and\r\nintellectual speculations. Today the Ts'ao-tung sect is differentiated\r\nfrom the Lin-chi primarily by its methods for teaching novices. There\r\nis no disagreement about the goal, merely about the path.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that the whole business of the Five Ranks seems not\r\nto have survived the Sung Dynasty. Ts'ao-tung's real contribution was\r\nessentially to revive the approach of Northern Ch'an, with its stress\r\non meditation, intellectual inquiry, stages of enlightenment, and the\r\nidea that Ch'an is not entirely inner- directed but may also have some\r\nplace in the world at large. This is the real achievement of Ts'ao-\r\ntung, and the quality that enabled it to survive and become Soto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Thirteen\r\n\r\nKUEI-SHAN, YUN-MEN, AND FA-YEN:\r\n\r\n                   THREE MINOR HOUSES\r\n\r\n _\r\n\r\nYun-men (left)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The \"five houses\" or sects of Ch'an that arose after the Great\r\nPersecution of 845 did not all appear simultaneously, nor did they\r\nenjoy equal influence. Whereas the Lin-chi and the Ts'ao-tung were\r\ndestined to survive and find their way to Japan, the three other houses\r\nwere treated less kindly by history. Nonetheless, in the search for\r\nenlightenment, each of the three other houses contributed techniques,\r\ninsights, and original ideas that enriched the Zen tradition. It is\r\nwith the stories of the masters who founded the three extinct houses\r\nthat we close out the era preceding the Sung Dynasty and the rise of\r\nthe koan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKUEI-SHAN, FOUNDER OF THE KUEI-YANG SECT\r\n\r\n\r\nThis earliest of the five houses was founded by a contemporary of\r\nHuang-po and follower of the Ma-tsu tradition known by the name Kuei-\r\nshan (771-853). Under his original name, Ling-yu, he left home at\r\nfifteen to become a monk, studying under a local Vinaya master in\r\npresent-day Fukien province. He later was ordained at Hangchow, where\r\nhe assiduously absorbed the _vinaya _and sutras of both Theravada and\r\nMahayana.1 Then at age twenty-three he traveled to Kiangsi and became a\r\npupil of the famous Ch'an lawgiver Po-chang Huai-hai.\r\n\r\nThe moment of Kuei-shan's enlightenment at the hands of Huai-hai is a\r\nZen classic. As the story goes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day as he was waiting upon [Huai-hai], the latter asked him to\r\npoke the stove, to see whether there was any fire left in it. Kuei-shan\r\npoked but found no fire. [Huai-hai] rose to poke it himself, and\r\nsucceeded in discovering a little spark. Showing it to his disciple, he\r\nasked, \"Is this not fire?\" Thereupon Kuei-shan became enlightened.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Just why this seemingly trivial incident should trigger enlightenment\r\nis clearly a matter that must be approached intuitively.3\r\n\r\nKuei-shan received his name from Mt. Kuei, where he was sent to found a\r\nmonastery by Po-chang Huai-hai. The circumstances of his selection\r\nreveal almost more than we would wish to know about the Ch'an monastic\r\nworld at the beginning of the ninth century. It happened that Huai-hai\r\nwas considering the idea of founding a new monastery on Mt. Kuei in\r\nHunan province. However, he was uncertain whether the venture would\r\nflourish, and consequently he turned for advice to a wandering\r\nfortuneteller named Ssu-ma.4 This seer responded that Mt. Kuei was an\r\nideal location and would support fifteen hundred monks. However, Huai-\r\nhai himself would not prosper there, since \"You are a bony, ascetic man\r\nand it is a fleshy, sensuous mountain.\" The advice was to find somebody\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nHuai-hai consented and began calling in his candidates for Ssu-ma to\r\nexamine. The first to be summoned was the head monk--whom Ssu-ma asked\r\nto produce a deep cough and then walk several steps. The wizened old\r\nmystic watched carefully and then whispered to Huai-hai that this was\r\nnot the man. Next to be called in was Kuei-shan, currently\r\nadministrator of the monastery. Ssu-ma took one look and nodded his\r\napproval to Huai-hai. That night Huai-hai summoned Kuei-shan and\r\nassigned his new mission: \"Go to Mt. Kuei and found the monastery that\r\nwill perpetuate my teachings.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the head monk discovered he had been passed over he was outraged\r\nand at the next morning's convocation demanded that Huai-hai justify\r\nthis slight. The master replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"If you can make an outstanding response in front of the assembly, you\r\nshall receive the appointment.\" [Huai-hai] then pointed to a pitcher\r\nand said to him, \"Do not call this a pitcher. What, instead, should you\r\ncall it?\" [The head monk] answered, \"It cannot be called a wooden\r\nwedge.\" Master [Huai-hai] did not accept this, and turned to [Kuei-\r\nshan], demanding his answer. [Kuei-shan] kicked the pitcher and knocked\r\nit over. Master [Huai-hai] laughed and said, \"Our head monk has lost\r\nhis bid for Mount Kuei._\"5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe head monk's reply had been intellectualizing wordplay, caught up in\r\nthe world of names and categories. Kuei-shan's reply was spontaneous,\r\nwordless, and devoid of distinctions. His was a mind that could\r\ntranscend rationality.\r\n\r\nKuei-shan did establish the monastery and from it a short-lived school.\r\nHowever, Kuei-shan's memory was perpetuated largely through a brilliant\r\npupil later known as Yang-shan (807-883) owing to his founding a\r\nmonastery on Mt. Yang in Kiangsi province. Together their teachings\r\nbecame known as the Kuei-yang school, the first of the \"five houses.\"\r\n\r\nThe exchanges between Kuei-shan and Yang-shan reported in _The\r\nTransmission of the Lamp_ are among the most electric in all Ch'an. In\r\nthe following they joust over the distinction between function of\r\nwisdom (which is revealed through action) and substance or self-nature\r\n(which is revealed through nonaction).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Once when all the monks were out picking tea leaves the Master said to\r\nYang-shan, \"All day as we were picking tea leaves I have heard your\r\nvoice, but I have not seen you yourself. Show me your original self.\"\r\nYang-shan thereupon shook the tea tree.\r\n\r\nThe Master said, \"You have attained only the function, not the\r\nsubstance.\" Yang-shan remarked, \"I do not know how you yourself would\r\nanswer the question.\" The Master was silent for a time. Yang-shan\r\ncommented, \"You, Master, have attained only the substance, not the\r\nfunction.\" Master Kuei-shan responded, \"I absolve you from twenty\r\nblows!_\"6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommentators differ on who won this exchange and whether Kuei-shan was\r\nreally satisfied. Another story relates similar fast-witted but serious\r\nrepartee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Two Ch'an monks came from [a rival] community and said, \"There is not\r\na man here who can understand Ch'an.\" Later, when all the monks went\r\nout to gather firewood, Yang-shan saw the two, who were resting; he\r\ntook a piece of firewood and asked them, \"Can you talk (about it)?\" As\r\nboth remained silent, Yang-shan said to them, \"Do not say that there is\r\nno one here who can understand Ch'an.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the monastery, Yang-shan reported to the master,\r\n\"Today, two Ch'an monks were exposed by me.\" The master asked, \"How did\r\nyou expose them?\" Yang-shan related the incident and the master said,\r\n\"I have now exposed you as well._\"7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe translator Charles Luk suggests that Kuei-shan had \"exposed\" Yang-\r\nshan by showing that he still distinguished between himself and the\r\nother monks.\r\n\r\nYet another story, reminiscent of Nan-ch'uan, further dramatizes the\r\nschool's teaching of nondiscrimination. The report recounts a present\r\nthat Kuei-shan sent to Yang-shan, now also a master and co-founder of\r\ntheir school:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kuei-shan sent [Yang-shan] a parcel containing a mirror. When he went\r\nto the hall, [Yang-shan] held up the mirror and said to the assembly,\r\n\"Please say whether this is Kuei-shan's or Yang-shan's mirror. If\r\nsomeone can give a correct reply, I will not smash it.\" As no one\r\nanswered, the master smashed the mirror.8\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nKuei-shan's answer to one pupil who requested that he \"explain\" Ch'an\r\nto him was to declare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_If I should expound it explicitly for you, in the future you will\r\nreproach me for it. Anyway, whatever I speak still belongs to me and\r\nhas nothing to do with you.9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_This monk, who later became the famous master Hsiang-yen, subsequently\r\nburned his sutras and wandered the countryside in despair. Then one day\r\nwhile cutting grass he nicked a piece of broken tile against some\r\nbamboo, producing a sharp snap that suddenly triggered his\r\nenlightenment. In elation he hurried back to his cell in the abandoned\r\nmonastery where he was living and burned incense to Kuei-shan,\r\ndeclaring, \"If you had broken the secret to me then, how could I have\r\nexperienced the wonderful event of today.\"10\r\n\r\nThe real contribution of the Kuei-yang sect is agreed to be the final\r\ndistinction Yang-shan made between the Ch'an of meditation (based on\r\nthe Lankavatara Sutra) and instantaneous Ch'an (that completely\r\ndivorced from the sutras). In this final revision of Ch'an history,\r\n\"traditional\" or \"Patriarchal\" Ch'an was redefined as the anti-sutra\r\nestablishment of the Southern school, while the teaching of the\r\nLankavatara, which actually had been the basis of the faith until the\r\nmiddle of the eighth century, was scorned as an aberration. He\r\nemphasized, in a sense, Ch'an's ultimate disowning of Buddhism--through\r\na new, manufactured \"history.\"\r\n\r\nKuei-shan died in the prescribed manner: After a ritual ablution he\r\nseated himself in the meditation posture and passed on with a smile. He\r\nwas buried on Mt. Kuei, home of his monastery. His followers and those\r\nof his pupil Yang-shan composed the Kuei-yang school, an early attempt\r\nto formalize the anti-sutra position of Ma-tsu.11 However, they were\r\nsupplanted by other much more successful followers of Huai-hai, such as\r\nHuang-po and Lin-chi, whose school became the real perpetuator of Ma-\r\ntsu's iconoclasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YUN-MEN SECT\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n_The Master Yun-men (862/4-949) was born in Kiangsu province (some say\r\nChekiang) to a family whose circumstances forced them to place him in a\r\nVinaya temple as a novice. But his inquiring mind eventually turned to\r\nCh'an, and off he went to a master, with his first target being the\r\nfamous Mu-chou, disciple of Huang-po. (Mu-chou is remembered as the\r\nmonk who sent Lin-chi in for his first three withering interviews with\r\nHuang-po.) For two days running, Yun-men tried to gain entry to see the\r\nmaster, but each time he was ejected. The third day he succeeded in\r\nreaching Mu-chou, who grabbed him and demanded, \"Speak! Speak!\" But\r\nbefore Yun-men could open his mouth, the master shoved him out of the\r\nroom and slammed the door, catching his leg and breaking it in the\r\nprocess. The unexpected bolt of pain shooting through Yun-men's body\r\nsuddenly brought his first enlightenment.12\r\n\r\nHe journeyed on, studying with several famous masters, until finally he\r\ninherited a monastery from a retiring master who sensed his genius.\r\nYun-men was one of the best-known figures from Ch'an's waning Golden\r\nAge, and stories of his exchanges with monks became a major source of\r\nkoans.13 He loathed words and forbade his followers to take notes or\r\nwrite down his sermons. (However, his talks were secretly recorded by a\r\nfollower who attended in a paper robe and kept notes on the garment.)\r\nAs did the earlier masters, he struggled mightily with the problem of\r\nhow to prevent novices from becoming attached to his words and phrases.\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n[Yun-men] came to the assembly again and said: \"My work here is\r\nsomething that I cannot help. When I tell you to penetrate directly\r\ninto all things and to be non-attached to them, I have already\r\nconcealed what is within you. Yet you all continue looking for Ch'an\r\namong my words, so that you may achieve enlightenment. With myriad\r\ndeviations and artificialities, you raise endless questions and\r\narguments. Thus, you merely gain temporary satisfactions from verbal\r\ncontests, repeatedly quarrel with words, and deviate even further from\r\nCh'an. When will you obtain it, and rest?_\"14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          He firmly believed that all teaching was useless; that all\r\nexplanations do more harm than good; and that, in fact, nothing\r\nworthwhile can ever be taught.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Master said, \"If I should give you a statement that would teach\r\nyou how to achieve Ch'an immediately, dirt would already be spread on\r\ntop of your head. . . . To grasp Ch'an, you must experience it. If you\r\nhave not experienced it, do not pretend to know. You should withdraw\r\ninwardly and search for the ground upon which you stand; thereby you\r\nwill find out what Truth is._\"15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of Yun-men's sermons reveals much about the growing pains of Ch'an.\r\nThe seriousness of the novices seems to have been steadily\r\ndeteriorating, and his characterization of the run-of-the- mill novices\r\nof his time presents a picture of waning dynamism. Success was clearly\r\nbringing a more frivolous student to the monasteries, and we sense here\r\nthe warning of a man who rightly feared for the future quality of\r\nCh'an.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Furthermore, some monks, idle and not serious in their studies, gather\r\ntogether trying to learn the sayings of the ancients, and attempt to\r\nreveal their own nature through memorizing, imagining, prophesying.\r\nThese people often claim that they understand what Dharma is. What they\r\nactually do is simply talk themselves into endless entanglements and\r\nuse meditation to pass the time.16\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe also felt the traditional pilgrimages from master to master had\r\nbecome hardly more than a glorified version of sightseeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do not waste your time wandering thousands of [miles], through this\r\ntown and that, with your staff on your shoulder, wintering in one place\r\nand spending the summer in another. Do not seek out beautiful mountains\r\nand rivers to contemplate. . . . [T]he fundamental thing for you to do\r\nis to obtain the essence of Ch'an. Then your travels will not have been\r\nin vain. If you find a way to guide your understanding under a severe\r\nmaster . . . wake up, hang up your bowl-bag, and break your staff.\r\nSpend ten or twenty years of study under him until you are thoroughly\r\nenlightened.17\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe also advised that they try to simplify their search, that they try\r\nto realize how uncomplicated Ch'an really is.\r\n\r\n_Let me tell you that anything you can directly point at will not lead\r\nyou to the right trail. . . . Besides dressing, eating, moving bowels,\r\nreleasing water, what else is there to do?18\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nYun-men was one of the most dynamic masters of the late ninth and early\r\ntenth century, providing new twists to the historic problem of\r\nnonlanguage transmission. His celebrated solution was the so-called\r\none-word answer. Several of these are preserved in the two major koan\r\ncollections of later years. Two of the better-known follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk asked Yun-men, \"What is the teaching that transcends the Buddha\r\nand patriarchs?\" Yun-men said, \"A sesame bun._\"19_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA monk asked Yun-men, \"What is Buddha?\" Yun-men replied, \"A dried piece\r\nof shit._\"20_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe \"one-word\" was his version of the blow and the shout. R. H. Blyth\r\nis particularly fond of Yun-men and suggests he may have had the\r\nkeenest intellect of any Ch'an master--and even goes so far as to\r\ndeclare him the greatest man China has produced.21\r\n\r\nAt the very least Yun-men was in the great tradition of the\r\niconoclastic T'ang masters, with a touch that bears comparison to\r\nHuang-po. And he probably was wise in attempting to stop copyists, for\r\nhis teachings eventually were reduced to yet another abominable system,\r\nas seemed irresistible to the Chinese followers of the five houses. A\r\nlater disciple produced what is known as the \"Three propositions of the\r\nhouse of Yun-men.\" It is not difficult to imagine the barnyard response\r\nYun-men would have had to this \"systematization\" of his thought.22 The\r\nschool of this \"most eloquent of Ch'an masters\" lasted through the Sung\r\ndynasty, but its failure to find a transplant in Japan eventually meant\r\nthat history would pass it by. Nonetheless, the cutting intellect of\r\nYun-men was one of the bright stars in the constellation of Ch'an,\r\nproviding what is possibly its purest antirational statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FA-YEN SECT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe master known as Fa-yen (885-958), founder of the third short-lived\r\nhouse of Ch'an, need not detain us long. Fa-yen's novel method for\r\ntriggering enlightenment was to repeat back the\r\n\r\nquestioner's own query, thereby isolating the words and draining them\r\nof their meaning. It was his version of the shout, the silence, the\r\nsingle word. And whereas the Lin-chi school was concerned with the Four\r\nProcesses of Liberation from Subjectivity and Objectivity and the\r\nTs'ao-tung school constructed the five relations between Particularity\r\nand Universality, the Fa-yen school invented the Six Attributes of\r\nBeing.23 The Six Attributes of Being (totality and differentiation,\r\nsameness and difference, becoming and disappearing) were adapted from\r\nthe doctrine of another Buddhist sect, and in fact later attempts by\r\none of Fa-yen's disciples to combine Ch'an and Pure Land Buddhism have\r\nbeen credited with accelerating the disappearance of his school.\r\n\r\nAccording to _The Transmission of the Lamp_, the master remembered as\r\nFa-yen was born as Wen-i, near Hangchow. He became a Ch'an novice at\r\nage seven and was ordained at twenty. Learned in both Buddhist and\r\nConfucianist literature (though not, significantly enough, in the\r\nTaoist classics), he then got the wanderlust, as was common, and headed\r\nsouth to seek out more Ch'an teachers. He ended up in Kiangsi province\r\nin the city of Fuchou, where to escape the floodings of a rainstorm he\r\nfound himself one evening in a local monastery. He struck up a\r\nconversation with the master there, who suddenly asked him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Where are you going, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall continue my foot travels along the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that which is called foot travel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not-knowing most closely approaches the Truth._\"24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Transmission of the Lamp _states that he was enlightened on the\r\nspot and decided to settle down for a period of study. He eventually\r\nbecame a famous teacher himself, shepherding as many as a thousand\r\nstudents at one time.\r\n\r\nOne of his most often repeated exchanges concerned the question of the\r\ndifference between the \"moon\" (i.e., enlightenment) and the \"finger\r\npointing at the moon,\" (i.e., the teaching leading to enlightenment).\r\nIt was a common observation that students confused the finger pointing\r\nat the moon with the moon itself, which is to say they confused talk\r\nabout enlightenment with the state. One day a monk came along who\r\nthought he was smart enough to get around the dilemma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk asked, \"As for the finger, I will not ask you about it. But\r\nwhat is the moon?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master said, \"Where is the finger that you do not ask about?\"\r\n\r\nSo the monk asked, \"As for the moon, I will not ask you about it. But\r\nwhat is the finger?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master said, \"The moon!\"\r\n\r\nThe monk challenged him, \"I asked about the finger; why should you\r\nanswer me, 'the moon'?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master replied, \"Because you asked about the finger._\"25\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt age seventy-four Fa-yen died in the manner of other great masters,\r\ncalmly and seated in the meditation posture. Part of the lineage of\r\nShih-t'ou and an offshoot of the branch of Ch'an that would become\r\nSoto, he was a kindly individual with none of the violence and\r\nhistrionics of the livelier masters. However, his school lasted only\r\nbriefly before passing into history. Nonetheless, a number of disciples\r\ninitially perpetuated his memory, and his wisdom is preserved in\r\nvarious Sung-period compilations of Ch'an sermons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Fourteen\r\n\r\n\r\nTA-HUI:\r\n\r\nMASTER OF THE KOAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTo confront the koan--the most discussed, least understood teaching\r\nconcept of the East--is to address the very essence of Zen itself. In\r\nsimple terms the koan is merely a brief story--all the encounters\r\nbetween two monks related here could be koans. During the Sung Dynasty\r\n(960-1279) these stories were organized into collections, commented\r\nupon, and structured into a system of study--which involved meditating\r\non a koan and arriving at an intuitive \"answer\" acceptable to a Zen\r\nmaster. Faced with the threatening intellectualism of the Sung\r\nscholars, Ch'anists created the koan out of the experience of the older\r\nmasters, much the way a liferaft might be constructed from the timbers\r\nof a storm-torn ship. But before we examine this raft, it would be well\r\nto look again at the ship.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that Ch'an grew out of both Buddhism and Taoism,\r\nextracting from them the belief that a fundamental unifying quality\r\ntranscends all the diversity of the world, including things that appear\r\nto be opposite. However, Ch'an taught that this cannot be understood\r\nusing intellectualism, which rationally makes distinctions and relates\r\nto the world by reducing it to concepts and systems. One reason is that\r\nall rationality and concepts are merely part of a larger, encompassing\r\nReality; and trying to reach this Reality intellectually is like trying\r\nto describe the outside of a building while trapped inside.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a kind of thought--not beholden to concepts, systems,\r\ndiscriminations, or rationality--that can reach this new understanding.\r\nIt is intuition, which operates in a mode entirely different from\r\nrationality. It is holistic, not linear; it is unself-conscious and\r\nnoncritical; and it doesn't bother with any of the rational systems of\r\nanalysis we have invented for ourselves. But since we can't call on it\r\nat our pleasure, the next best thing we can do is clear the way for it\r\nto operate--by shutting off the rational part of the mind. Then\r\nintuition starts hesitantly coming out of the shadows. Now, if we\r\ncarefully wait for the right moment and then suddenly create a\r\ndisturbance that momentarily short-circuits the rational mind--the way\r\nshock suppresses our sense of pain in the first moments of a serious\r\naccident--we may get a glimpse of the intuitive mind in full flower. In\r\nthat instant we intuitively understand the oneness of the world, the\r\nVoid, the greater Reality that words and rationality have never allowed\r\nus to experience.\r\n\r\nThe Zen teachers have a very efficient technique for making all this\r\nhappen. They first discredit rationality for a novice by making him\r\nfeel foolish for using it. Each time the novice submits a rational\r\nsolution to a koan, he receives a humiliating rebuff. After a while the\r\nstrain begins to tell. In the same way that a military boot camp\r\ndestroys the ego and self-identity of a recruit, the Zen master slowly\r\nerodes the novice's confidence in his own logical powers.\r\n\r\nAt this point his intuitive mind begins overcoming its previous\r\nrepression. Distinctions slowly start to seem absurd, because every\r\ntime he makes one he is ridiculed. Little by little he dissolves his\r\nsense of object and subject, knower and known. The fruit now is almost\r\nready to fall from the tree. (Although enlightenment cannot be made to\r\nhappen, it can be made possible.) Enter at this point the unexpected\r\nblow, the shout, the click of bamboo, the broken leg. If the student is\r\ncaught unawares, rationality may be momentarily short-circuited and\r\nsuddenly he glimpses--Reality.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that what he glimpses is no different from what he saw\r\nbefore, only now he understands it intuitively and realizes how\r\nsimplistic and confining are rational categories and distinctions.\r\nMountains are once again mountains; rivers are once again rivers. But\r\nwith one vital difference: Now he is not attached to them. He travels\r\nthrough the world just as always, but now he is at one with it: no\r\ndistinctions, no critical judgments, no tension. After all that\r\npreparatory mental anguish there is no apparent external change. But\r\ninternally he is enlightened: He thinks differently, he understands\r\ndifferently, and ultimately he lives differently.\r\n\r\nCh'an began by working out the question of what this enlightenment\r\nreally is. Prior to Ma-tsu the search was more for the nature of\r\nenlightenment than for its transmission. This was the doctrinal phase\r\nof Ch'an. As time went by, however, the concern shifted more and more\r\nfrom defining enlightenment--which the Ch'an masters believed had been\r\ndone sufficiently--to struggling with the process. After Ma-tsu, Ch'an\r\nturned its attention to \"auxiliary means\" for helping along\r\ntransmission: paradoxical words and actions, shouts, beatings, and\r\neventually the koan.1\r\n\r\nThe koan, then, is the final step in the \"auxiliary means.\" A succinct\r\nanalysis of the koan technique is provided by Ruth F. Sasaki in _Zen\r\nDust_: \"Briefly, [koans] consisted of questions the early masters had\r\nasked individual students, together with the answers given by the\r\nstudents; questions put to the masters by students in personal talks or\r\nin the course of the masters' lectures, together with the masters'\r\nanswers; statements of formulas in which the masters had pointed to the\r\nprofound Principle; anecdotes from the daily life of the masters in\r\nwhich their attitudes or actions illustrated the functioning of the\r\nPrinciple; and occasionally a phrase from a sutra in which the\r\nPrinciple or some aspect of it was crystallized in words. By presenting\r\na student with one or another of these koans and observing his reaction\r\nto it, the degree or depth of his realization could be judged. The\r\nkoans were the criteria of attainment.\"2\r\n\r\nCalled _kung-an _in Chinese (meaning a \"case\" or a problem), the koan\r\nwas a response to two major challenges that beset Ch'an in the Sung\r\nera: First, the large number of students that appeared at Ch'an\r\nmonasteries as a result of the demise of other sects meant that some\r\nnew means was needed to preserve personalized attention (some masters\r\nreportedly had one thousand or even two thousand followers at a\r\nmonastery); and second, there was a noticeable decline in the\r\nspontaneity of both novices and masters. The masters had lost much of\r\nthe creative fire of Ch'an's Golden Age, and the novices were caught up\r\nin the intellectual, literary world of the Sung, to the point that\r\nintellectualism actually threatened the vitality of the sect.\r\n\r\nThe koan, then, was the answer to this dilemma. It systematized\r\ninstruction such that large numbers of students could be treated to the\r\nfinest antirational tradition of the Ch'an sect, and it rescued the\r\ndynamism of the earlier centuries. Although mention of kung-an occurs\r\nin the Ch'an literature before the end of the T'ang era (618-907), the\r\nreference was to a master's use of a particularly effectual question on\r\nmore than one student. This was still an instance of a master using his\r\nown questions or paradoxes. The koan in its true form--that is, the use\r\nof a classic incident from the literature, posed as a conundrum--is said\r\nto have been created when a descendant of Lin-chi, in the third\r\ngeneration, interviewed a novice about some of Lin-chi's sayings.3 This\r\nsystematic use of the existing literature was found effective, and soon\r\na new teaching technique was in the making.\r\n\r\nExamples of classic koans already have been seen throughout this book,\r\nsince many of the exchanges of the early masters were later isolated\r\nfor use as kung-an. But there are many, many others, Perhaps the best-\r\nknown koan of all time is the exchange between Chao-chou (778-897) and\r\na monk:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk asked Chao-chou. \"Does a dog have Buddha nature [i.e., is a dog\r\ncapable of being enlightened]?\" Chao-chou answered, _\"Mu _[a word whose\r\nstrict meaning is \"nothingness\"]._\"4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick, what does it mean? Speak! Speak! If you were a Ch'an novice, a\r\nmaster would be glaring at you demanding an immediate, intuitive\r\nanswer. (A favored resolution of this, incidentally, is simply \"Mu,\"\r\nbut bellowed with all the force of the universe's inherent Oneness\r\nbehind it. And if you try to fake it, the master will know.) Or take\r\nanother koan, drawn completely at random.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When the monks assembled before the noon meal to hear his lecture, the\r\nMaster Fa-yen [885-958] pointed at the bamboo blinds. Two monks\r\nsimultaneously went and rolled them up. Fa-yen said, \"One gain, one\r\nloss._\"5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't think! Respond instantly! Don't say a word unless it's right,\r\nDon't make a move that isn't intuitive. And above all, don't analyze.\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nYun-men [862/4-949] asked a monk, \"Where have you come here from?\" The\r\nmonk said, \"From Hsi-ch'an.\" Yun-men said, \"What words are being\r\noffered at Hsi-ch'an these days?\" The monk stretched out his hands.\r\nYun-men struck him. The monk said, \"I haven't finished talking.\" Yun-\r\nmen then extended his own hands. The monk was silent, so Yun-men struck\r\nhim._6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou weren't there. You're not the monk. But now you've got to do\r\nsomething to show the master you grasp what went on in that exchange.\r\nWhat was spontaneous to the older masters you must grasp in a\r\nsecondhand, systematized situation. And if you can't answer the koan\r\nright (it should be stressed, incidentally, there is not necessarily a\r\nfixed answer), you had best go and meditate, try to grasp it\r\nnonintellectually, and return tomorrow to try again.\r\n\r\nOff you go to meditate on \"Mu\" or \"One gain, one loss,\" and the mental\r\ntension starts building. Even though you know you aren't supposed to,\r\nyou analyze it intellectually from every angle. But that just heightens\r\nyour exasperation. Then suddenly one day something dawns on you.\r\nElated, you go to the master. You yell at him, or bark like a dog, or\r\nkick his staff, or stand on your hands, or recite a poem, or declare,\r\n\"The cypress tree in the courtyard,\" or perhaps you just remain silent.\r\nHe will know (intuitively) if you have broken through the bonds of\r\nreason, if you have transcended the intellect.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing quite like the koan in the literature of the world:\r\nhistorical episodes that have to be relived intuitively and responded\r\nto. As Ruth F. Sasaki notes, \"Collections of 'old cases,' as the koans\r\nwere sometimes called, as well as attempts to put the koans into a\r\nfixed form and to systematize them to some extent, were already being\r\nmade by the middle of the tenth century. We also find a few masters\r\ngiving their own alternate answers to some of the old koans and\r\noccasionally appending verses to them. In many cases these alternate\r\nanswers and verses ultimately became attached to the original koans and\r\nwere handled as koans supplementary to them.\"7 Ironically, koans became\r\nso useful, indeed essential, in the perpetuation of Ch'an that they\r\nsoon were revered as texts. Collections of the better koans appeared,\r\nand next came accretions of supporting commentaries--when the whole\r\npoint was supposed to be circumventing reliance on words! But\r\ncommentaries always seemed to develop spontaneously out of Ch'an.\r\n\r\nToday two major collections of koans are generally used by students of\r\nZen. These are the Mumonkan (to use the more familiar Japanese name)\r\nand the Hekiganroku (again the Japanese name) or _Blue Cliff Record_.8\r\nMasters may work a student through both these collections as he travels\r\nthe road to enlightenment, with a new koan being assigned after each\r\nprevious one has been successfully resolved.\r\n\r\nThe _Blue Cliff Record _was the first of the two collections. It began\r\nas a grouping of one hundred kung-an by a master named Hsueh-tou\r\nCh'ung-hsien (980-1052) of the school of Yun-men. This master also\r\nattached a small poem to each koan, intended to direct the student\r\ntoward its meaning. The book enjoyed sizable circulation throughout the\r\nlatter part of the eleventh century, and sometime thereafter a Lin-chi\r\nmaster named Yuan-wu K'o-ch'in (1063-1135) decided to embellish it by\r\nadding an introduction to each koan and a long-winded commentary on\r\nboth the koan and the poem supplied by the previous collector. (In the\r\ncase of the poem we now have commentary on commentary--the ultimate\r\nachievement of the theologian's art! However, masters today often omit\r\nYuan-wu's commentaries, giving their own interpretation instead.9) The\r\ncommentator, Yuan-wu, was the teacher of Ta-hui, the dynamic master of\r\nthe Lin-chi lineage whom we will meet here.\r\n\r\nThe Mumonkan, a shorter work, was assembled in 1228 by the Ch'an monk\r\nWu-men Hui-k'ai (1183-1260) and consists of forty-eight koans, together\r\nwith an explanatory comment and a verse. Some of the koans in the\r\nMumonkan also appear in the _Blue Cliff Record_. The Mumonkan is\r\nusually preferred in the Japanese summer, since its koans are briefer\r\nand less fatiguing.10\r\n\r\nThe koan was an invention of the Sung Dynasty (960-1279), an era of\r\nconsolidation in the Chinese empire after the demise of the T'ang and\r\npassage of a war-torn interlude known as the Five Dynasties (907-60).\r\nAlthough Sung Ch'an seemed to be booming, Buddhism in general continued\r\nthe decline that began with the Great Persecution of 845. For example,\r\nthe number of registered monks dropped from around 400,000 in 1021 to\r\napproximately half that number a scant half-century later.11 But the\r\nmonks who did come probably had higher education than previously, for\r\nthe Sung educational system was the world's best at the time. Colleges\r\nwere established nationwide, not just in the sophisticated metropolitan\r\nareas, and scholarship flourished. Whether this was good for Ch'an is\r\nnot a simple question. The hardy rural monks who had passed beyond the\r\nBuddhist scriptures made Ch'an what it was. Could the powers of the\r\nantirational be preserved in an atmosphere where the greatest respect\r\nwas reserved for those who spent years memorizing the Chinese classics?\r\nThe answer to this was to rest with the koan.\r\n\r\nThe Ch'an master Ta-hui (1089-1163), who perfected the koan technique,\r\nwas rumored to be a reincarnation of Lin-chi. Born in Anhwei province,\r\nlocated about halfway between the older capitals of the north and the\r\nCh'an centers in the south, he was said to be both pious and\r\nprecocious, becoming a devoted monk at age seventeen while assiduously\r\nreading and absorbing the teachings of the five houses.12 At age\r\nnineteen, he began his obligatory travels, roaming from master to\r\nmaster. One of his first teachers reportedly interviewed him on the\r\nkoans in the collection now known as the _Blue Cliff Record_, but he\r\ndid so by not speaking a word and thereby forcing Ta-hui to work them\r\nout for himself. Ta-hui also experimented with the Ts'ao-tung\r\nteachings, but early on began to question the straitlaced, quietistic\r\napproach of that house. He finally was directed to the Szechuan teacher\r\nYuan-wu K'o-ch'in of the Lin-chi school, beginning the association that\r\nwould move him to the forefront of the struggle to save Ch'an via the\r\nkoan.\r\n\r\nTa-hui experienced his first enlightenment under Yuan-wu, in the\r\nmaster's temple in the Northern Sung capital of Pien-liang. As the\r\nstory is reported:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day when Yuan-wu had taken the high seat in the lecture hall, he\r\nsaid: \"A monk asked Yun-men: 'From whence come all the buddhas?' Yun-\r\nmen answered: 'The East Mountain walks over the water.' But if I were\r\nasked, I would not answer that way. 'From whence come all the buddhas?'\r\nA fragrant breeze comes of itself from the south, and in the palace\r\npavilion a refreshing coolness stirs.\" At these words [Ta-hui] suddenly\r\nattained enlightenment.13\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAfter this he grew in experience and wisdom, eventually taking over\r\nmany temple duties from Yuan-wu. He soon became a part of the Ch'an\r\nestablishment in the north and in 1126 was even presented with an\r\nofficial robe and title from a minister.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, in the midst of this tranquillity, outside forces\r\nintervened to change dramatically the course of Chinese history. For\r\nmany years previous, China had been threatened by nomadic peoples from\r\nthe north and west, peoples whom the Chinese haughtily identified as\r\n\"barbarians.\" The Sung emperors, cloistered gentlemen in the worst\r\nsense of the term, had maintained peace in their slowly shrinking\r\ndomain by buying off belligerent neighbors and occasionally even ceding\r\nborder territories. They thought their troubles finally might be easing\r\nsomewhat when their hostile neighbors were overwhelmed by a new warring\r\ntribe from Manchuria. But after a series of humiliating incidents, the\r\nChinese found themselves with merely a new enemy, this time more\r\npowerful than any before. China was at last on the verge of being\r\noverwhelmed, something it had forestalled for many centuries. Even the\r\ninvention of gunpowder, which the Chinese now used to fire rocket-\r\npropelled arrows, could not save them. Before long the barbarians\r\nmarched on the capital, and after some years of Chinese attempts at\r\nappeasement, the invaders carried off the emperor and his entire court\r\nto Manchuria. The year was 1127, which marked the end of the Chinese\r\ndynasty now known as the Northern Sung (960-1127).\r\n\r\nAfter this disheartening setback a son of the former emperor moved\r\nsouth and set up a new capital in the coastal city of Hangchow, whose\r\ncharms the Chinese were fond of comparing\r\n\r\nfavorably with heaven (in the refrain, \"Heaven above; Hangchow below\").\r\nThis new regime, known as the Southern Sung (1127-1279), witnessed yet\r\nanother transformation of Ch'an. Among other things, Southern Ch'an\r\ncame to resemble eighth-century Northern Ch'an, in its close\r\nassociation with the court and the intelligentsia.\r\n\r\nWhen political discord forced the Northern Sung government to flee\r\nsouth, the master Yuan-wu was assigned a monastery in the southern\r\nprovince of Kiangsi by the emperor, and Ta-hui accompanied him there,\r\nagain as head monk. After four years, Ta-hui again decided to migrate--\r\nthis time alone--to Szechuan and there to build a secluded hermitage.\r\nAfter another move he was summoned in 1137 by the prime minister,\r\nhimself also a former pupil of Yuan-wu, to come and establish a temple\r\nnear the new southern capital of Hangchow. Before long he had collected\r\nalmost two thousand disciples and was becoming known as the\r\nreincarnation of Lin-chi, possibly because he was giving new life to\r\nthe Lin-chi sect. But then his politics got him in trouble and he was\r\nbanished for almost fifteen years to various remote outposts, during\r\nwhich time he began to write extensively.14 Finally, in 1158, he was\r\nordered back to Hangchow to take over his old temple. Since by then old\r\nage was encroaching, he was permitted to retire at this temple and live\r\noff imperial patronage. It is said that his pupils swelled to seventeen\r\nhundred when he returned and that when he died in 1163 he left ninety-\r\nfour enlightened heirs.15\r\n\r\nTa-hui is regarded today as the great champion of the koan method, and\r\nhe was celebrated during his life for a running disagreement he had\r\nwith the Ts'ao-tung (later Soto) school. In a sense, this dispute drew\r\nthe distinctions that still divide Zen into two camps. The issue seems\r\nto have boiled down to the matter of what one does with one's mind\r\nwhile meditating. The Ts'ao-tung masters advocated what they called\r\nSilent Illumination (_mo-chao_) Ch'an, which Ta-hui preferred to call\r\nSilent Illumination Heterodox (_mo-chao-hsieh_) Ch'an. The Ts'ao-tung\r\nmaster Cheng-chueh, with whom he argued, believed that enlightenment\r\ncould be achieved through sitting motionless and slowly bringing\r\ntranquillity and empty nonattachment to the mind. The koans were\r\nrecognized to be useful in preserving the original spirit of Ch'an, but\r\ntheir brain-fatiguing convolutions were not permitted to disturb the\r\nmental repose of meditation. Ta-hui, in contrast, believed that this\r\nsilent meditation lacked the dynamism so essential to the sudden\r\nexperience of enlightenment. His own approach to enlightenment came to\r\nbe called Introspecting-the-Koan (_k'an-hua_) Ch'an, in which\r\nmeditation focused on a koan.16\r\n\r\n Another of Ta-hui's objections to the Silent Illumination school seems\r\nto have been its natural drift toward quietism, toward the divorcing of\r\nmen from the world of affairs. This he believed led nowhere and was\r\nmerely renouncing humanity rather than illuminating it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_These days there's a breed of shaven-headed outsiders [i.e., rival\r\nmasters] whose own eyes are not clear, who just teach people to stop\r\nand rest and play dead. . . . They teach people to \"keep the mind\r\nstill,\" to \"forget feelings\" according to circumstances, to practice\r\n\"silent illumination.\" . . . To say that when one has put things to\r\nrest to the point that he is unawares and unknowing, like earth, wood,\r\ntile, or stone, this is not unknowing silence--this is a view of wrongly\r\ntaking too literally words that were (only) expedient means to free\r\nbonds.17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_He seemed to be counseling never to forget that meditation is only a\r\nmeans, not an end. Instead Ta-hui advocated meditating deeper and ever\r\ndeeper into a koan, focusing on the words until they \"lose their\r\nflavor.\" Then finally the bottom falls out of the bucket and\r\nenlightenment hits you. This \"Introspecting the Koan\" form of Ch'an\r\n(called Kanna Zen by the Japanese) became the standard for the Rinzai\r\nsect, whose students were encouraged to meditate on a koan until it\r\ngradually infiltrated the mind. As one commentator has explained, \"The\r\nessential is to immerse oneself patiently and wholeheartedly in the\r\nkoan, with unwavering attention. One must not be looking for an answer\r\nbut looking at the koan. The 'answer,' if it comes, will come of its\r\nown accord.\"18 As described by Ta-hui:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Just steadily go on with your koan every moment of your life. . . .\r\nWhether walking or sitting, let your attention be fixed upon it without\r\ninterruption. When you begin to find it entirely devoid of flavor, the\r\nfinal moment is approaching: do not let it slip out of your grasp. When\r\nall of a sudden something flashes out in your mind, its light will\r\nillumine the entire universe, and you will see the spiritual land of\r\nthe Enlightened Ones. . . .19\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe important thing is to concentrate totally on a koan. This\r\nconcentration need not necessarily be confined to meditation, as Ta-hui\r\nillustrates using one of the more celebrated one-word statements of\r\nYun-men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monk asked Yun-Men, \"What is Buddha?\" Yun-Men said, \"A dry piece of\r\nshit.\" Just bring up this saying. . . .Don't ask to draw realization\r\nfrom the words or try in your confusion to assess and explain. . . .\r\nJust take your confused unhappy mind and shift it onto \"A dry piece of\r\nshit.\" Once you hold it there, then the mind . . . will naturally no\r\nlonger operate. When you become aware that it's not operating, don't be\r\nafraid of falling into emptiness. . . . In the conduct of your daily\r\nactivities, just always let go and make yourself vast and expansive.\r\nWhether you're in quiet or noisy places, constantly arouse yourself\r\nwith the saying \"A dry piece of shit.\" As the days and months come and\r\ngo, of itself your potential will be purified and ripen. Above all you\r\nmust not arouse any external doubts besides: when your doubts about \"A\r\ndry piece of shit\" are smashed, then at once doubts numerous as the\r\nsands of the Ganges are all smashed.20\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAlthough Ta-hui was a strong advocate of the koan, he was staunchly\r\nagainst its being used in a literary sense. Whenever a student starts\r\nanalyzing koans intellectually, comparing one against another, trying\r\nto understand rationally how they affect his nonrational intelligence,\r\nhe misses the whole point. The only way it can work is if it is fresh.\r\nOnly then does it elicit a response from our spontaneous intelligence,\r\nour intuitive mind.\r\n\r\nBut the Sung trend toward intellectualism was almost irresistible. The\r\nprestige of the Chinese \"gentleman\"--who could quote the ancient poets,\r\ncompose verse himself, and analyze enlightenment--was the great nemesis\r\nof Ch'an.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of affairs who study the path often understand rationally\r\nwithout getting to the reality. Without discussion and thought they are\r\nat a loss, with no place to put their hands and feet--they won't believe\r\nthat where there is no place to put one's hands and feet is really a\r\ngood situation. They just want to get there in their minds by thinking\r\nand in their mouths to understand by talking--they scarcely realize\r\nthey've already gone wrong.21\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nEqually bad was the Ch'an student who memorized koans rather than\r\ntrying to understand them intuitively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A gentleman reads widely in many books basically in order to augment\r\nhis innate knowledge. Instead, you have taken to memorizing the words\r\nof the ancients, accumulating them in\r\n\r\nyour breast, making this your task, depending on them for something to\r\ntake hold of in conversation. You are far from knowing the intent of\r\nthe sages in expounding the teachings. This is what is called counting\r\nthe treasure of others all day long without having half a cent of your\r\nown.22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ta-hui rightly recognized in such scholarship an impending destruction\r\nof Ch'an's innate vigor. At one point, in desperation, he even\r\ndestroyed the original printing blocks for the best-known koan\r\ncollection of the time, the _Blue Cliff Record _compiled by his master,\r\nYuan-wu.23 But the trend continued nonetheless.\r\n\r\nCh'an was not over yet, however. It turns out that the sect did not\r\ncontinue to fly apart and diversify as might be suspected, but rather\r\nit actually consolidated. Although the Kuei-yang and Fa-yen houses\r\nfizzled comparatively quickly, the Yun-men lasted considerably longer,\r\nwith an identifiable line of transmission lasting virtually throughout\r\nthe Sung Dynasty. The Ts'ao-tung house languished for a while, but with\r\nSilent Illumination Ch'an it came back strongly during the Sung\r\nDynasty. Lin-chi split into two factions in the early eleventh century,\r\nwhen two pupils of the master Ch'u-yuan (986-1036) decided to go their\r\nown way, One of these masters, known as Huang-lung Hui-nan (1002-1069),\r\nstarted a school which subsequently was transmitted to Japan by the\r\nJapanese master Eisai, where it became known as Oryo Zen. However, this\r\nschool did not last long in China or Japan, becoming moribund after a\r\nfew generations. The other disciple of Ch'u-yuan was a master named\r\nYang-ch'i Fang-hui (992-1049), whose school (known in Japanese as Yogi\r\nZen) eventually became the only school of Chinese Ch'an, absorbing all\r\nother sects when the faith went into its final decline after the Sung.\r\nTa-hui was part of this school, and it was the branch of the Lin-chi\r\nsect that eventually took hold in Japan.\r\n\r\nIn closing our journey through Chinese Ch'an we must note that the\r\nfaith continued on strongly through the Sung largely because the\r\ngovernment began selling ordinations for its own profit. Ch'an also\r\ncontinued to flourish during the Mongol-dominated Yuan Dynasty (1279-\r\n1309), with many priests from Japan coming to China for study. During\r\nthe Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), it merged with another school of\r\nBuddhism, the Pure Land Salvationist sect, and changed drastically.\r\nAlthough Ming-style Chinese Ch'an still persists today, mainly outside\r\nChina, its practice bears scant resemblance to the original teachings.\r\nFor the practice of the classical Ch'an described here we must now turn\r\nto Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n PART IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZEN IN JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . in which Ch'an is imported to Japan by traditional Buddhists\r\ndisillusioned with the spiritual decadence of existing Japanese sects.\r\nThrough a fortuitous association with the rising military class, Ch'an\r\nis eventually elevated to the most influential religion of Japan.\r\nBefore long, however, it evolves into a political and cultural rather\r\nthan a spiritual force. Although some Japanese attempt to restore\r\nCh'an's original vigor by deliberately attacking its \"High Church\"\r\ninstitutions, few Japanese Zen teachers respect its original teachings\r\nand practice. Japanese teachers contribute little to the Ch'an (Zen)\r\nexperience until finally, in the eighteenth century, a spiritual leader\r\nappears who not only restores the original vitality of the faith, but\r\ngoes on to refine the koan practice and revolutionize the relationship\r\nof Zen to the common people. This inspired teacher, Hakuin, creates\r\nmodern Zen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Fifteen\r\n\r\nEISAI:\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST JAPANESE MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a twelfth-century story that the first Japanese monk who\r\njourneyed to China to study Ch'an returned home to find a summons from\r\nthe Japanese court. There, in a meeting reminiscent of the Chinese\r\nsovereign Wu and the Indian Bodhidharma some seven hundred years\r\nbefore, Japan's emperor commanded him to describe the teachings of this\r\nstrange new cult. The bemused monk (remembered by the name Kakua)\r\nreplied with nothing more than a melody on his flute, leaving the court\r\nflabbergasted.1 But what more ideal expression of China's wordless\r\ndoctrine?\r\n\r\nAs in the China entered by Bodhidharma, medieval Japan already knew the\r\nteachings of Buddhism. In fact, the Japanese ruling classes had been\r\nBuddhist for half a millennium before Ch'an officially came to their\r\nattention. However, contacts with China were suspended midway during\r\nthis time, leaving Japanese Buddhists out of touch with the many\r\nchanges in China--the most significant being Ch'an's rise to the\r\ndominant Buddhist sect.2 Consequently the Japanese had heard almost\r\nnothing about this sect when contacts resumed in the twelfth century.\r\nTo their amazement they discovered that Chinese Buddhism had become\r\nCh'an. The story of Ch'an's transplant in Japan is also the story of\r\nits preservation, since it was destined to wither away in China.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should review briefly how traditional Buddhism got to Japan\r\nin the first place. During the sixth century, about the time of\r\nBodhidharma, a statue of the Buddha and some sutras were transmitted to\r\nJapan as a gift/bribe from a Korean monarch seeking military aid. He\r\nclaimed Buddhism was very powerful although difficult to understand.\r\nNot all Japanese, however, were overjoyed with the appearance of a new\r\nfaith. The least pleased were those employed by the existing religion,\r\nthe Japanese cult of Shinto, and they successfully discredited Buddhism\r\nfor several decades. But a number of court intrigues were underway at\r\nthe time, and one faction got the idea that Buddhism would be helpful\r\nin undermining the Shinto-based ruling clique. Eventually this new\r\nfaction triumphed, and by the middle of the seventh century, the\r\nJapanese were constructing Buddhist temples and pagodas.3\r\n\r\nOther imports connected with these early mainland contacts were Chinese\r\nwriting and the Chinese style of government. The Japanese even\r\nrecreated the T'ang capital of Ch'ang-an, consecrated at the beginning\r\nof the eighth century as Nara, their first real city. The growing\r\nBuddhist establishment soon overwhelmed Nara with a host of sects and\r\ntemples, culminating in 752 with the unveiling of a bronze meditating\r\nBuddha larger than any statue in the world.\r\n\r\nJapan was now awash in thirdhand Buddhism, as Chinese missionaries\r\npatronizingly expounded Sanskrit scriptures they themselves only\r\nvaguely understood. Buddhism's reputation for powerful magic soon\r\ndemoralized the simple religion of Shinto, with its unpretentious\r\nshrines and rites, and this benign nature reverence was increasingly\r\npushed into the background. The impact of Buddhism became so\r\noverwhelming that the alarmed emperor finally abandoned Nara entirely\r\nto the Buddhists, and at the close of the eighth century set up a new\r\ncapital in central Japan, known today as Kyoto.\r\n\r\nThe emperor also decided to discredit the Nara Buddhists on their own\r\nterms, sending to China for new, competing sects. Back came emissaries\r\nwith two new schools, which soon assumed dominance of Japanese\r\nBuddhism. The first of these was Tendai, named after the Chinese T'ien-\r\nt'ai school. Its teachings centered on the Lotus Sutra, which taught\r\nthat the human Buddha personified a universal spirit, evidence of the\r\noneness permeating all things. The Tendai school was installed on Mt.\r\nHiei, in the outskirts of Kyoto, giving birth to an establishment\r\neventually to number several thousand buildings. The monks on Mt. Hiei\r\nbecame the authority on Buddhist matters in Japan for several centuries\r\nthereafter, and later they also began meddling in affairs of state,\r\nsometimes even resorting to arms. Tendai was, and perhaps to some\r\ndegree still is, a faith for the fortunate few. It did not stress an\r\nidealized hereafter, since it served a class--the idle aristocracy--\r\nperfectly comfortable in the present world. In any case, it became the\r\nmajor Japanese Buddhist sect during the Heian era (794-1185), a time of\r\naristocratic rule.\r\n\r\nThe other important, and also aristocratic, version of Buddhism\r\npreceding Zen was called Shingon, from the Chinese school Chen-yen, a\r\nmagical-mystery sect thriving on secrecy and esoteric symbolism. It\r\nappealed less to the intellect than did Tendai and more to the taste\r\nfor entertainment among the bored aristocrats. Although Shingon\r\nmonasteries often were situated in remote mountainous areas, the\r\nintrigue of their engaging ceremonies (featuring efflorescent\r\niconography, chants, and complex liturgies) and their evocative\r\nmandalas (geometrical paintings full of symbolism) made this sect a\r\ntheatrical success. This so-called Esoteric Buddhism of Shingon grew so\r\npopular that the sober Tendai sect was obliged to start adding\r\nritualistic complexity into its own practices.4\r\n\r\nThe Japanese government broke off relations with China less than a\r\nhundred years after the founding of Kyoto, around the middle of the\r\nninth century. From then until the mid-twelfth century mainland\r\ncontacts virtually ceased, and consequently both Japanese culture and\r\nJapanese Buddhism gradually evolved away from their Chinese models. The\r\nJapanese aristocracy became obsessed with aesthetics, finery, and\r\nrefined lovemaking accompanied by poetry, perfumes, and flowers.5  They\r\ndistilled the vigorous T'ang culture to a refined essence, rather like\r\nextracting a delicate liqueur from a stout potion.\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist church also grew decadent, even as it grew ever more\r\npowerful and ominous. The priesthood became the appointment of last\r\nresort for otherwise unemployable courtiers, and indeed Buddhism\r\nfinally degenerated largely into an entertainment for the ruling class,\r\nwhose members were amused and diverted by its rites. This carefree\r\naristocracy also allowed increasing amounts of wealth and land to slip\r\ninto the hands of corrupt religious establishments. For their own part,\r\nthe Buddhists began forming armies of monks to protect their new\r\nwealth, and they eventually went on to engage in inter-temple wars and\r\nthreaten the civil government.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the Japanese aristocracy preserved its privileged\r\nposition through the unwise policy of using an emerging military class\r\nto maintain order. These professional soldiers seem to have arisen from\r\nthe aristocacy itself. Japanese emperors had a large number of women at\r\ntheir disposal, through whom they scattered a host of progeny, not all\r\nof which could be maintained idle in Kyoto. A number of these were sent\r\nto the provinces, where they were to govern untamed outlying areas.\r\nThis continued until one day the court in Kyoto awoke to find that\r\nJapan was in fact controlled by these rural clans and their mounted\r\nwarriors, the samurai.6\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the twelfth century, the samurai effectively seized\r\nJapan, and their strongman invented for himself the title of _shogun_,\r\nproceeding to institute what became almost eight centuries of unbroken\r\nwarrior rule. The age of the common man had arrived, and one of the\r\n_shogun's _first acts was to transfer the government away from\r\naristocratic Kyoto, whose sophisticated society made him uncomfortable,\r\nto a warrior camp called Kamakura, near the site of modern Tokyo. The\r\nrule of Japan passed from perfumed, poetry-writing aesthetes to fierce,\r\noften illiterate swordsmen.\r\n\r\nCoincident with this coup, the decadence and irrelevance of traditional\r\nBuddhism had begun to weigh heavily upon a new group of spiritual\r\nreformers. Before long Tendai and Shingon were challenged by new faiths\r\nrecognizing the existence and spiritual needs of the common people. One\r\nform this reformation took was the appearance of new sects providing\r\nspiritual comfort to the masses and the possibility of eternal\r\nsalvation through some simple act, usually the repetition of a sacred\r\nchant. One, and later two, such sects (Jodo and Jodo Shin) focused on\r\nthe Buddhist figure Amida, whose Paradise or \"Pure Land\" in the\r\nhereafter was open to all those calling upon his name (by chanting a\r\nsort of Buddhist \"Hail Mary\" called the _nembutsu_, \"Praise to Amida\r\nBuddha\"). Another simplified sect preached a fundamentalist return to\r\nthe Lotus Sutra and was led by a firebrand named Nichiren, who also\r\ncreated a chant for his largely illiterate followers. A formula\r\nguaranteeing Paradise had particular appeal to the samurai, whose day-\r\nto-day existence was dangerous and uncertain. The scandalized Tendai\r\nmonks vigorously opposed this home-grown populist movement,\r\noccasionally even burning down temples to discourage its growth. But\r\nthe Pure Land and Nichiren sects continued to flourish, since the\r\ncommon people finally had a Buddhism all their own.\r\n\r\nThere were others, however, who believed that the aristocratic sects\r\ncould be reformed from within--by importing them afresh from China, from\r\nthe source. These reformers hoped that Buddhism in China had maintained\r\nits integrity and discipline during the several centuries of\r\nseparation. And by fortunate coincidence, Japanese contacts with the\r\nmainland were being reopened, making it again allowable to undertake\r\nthe perilous sea voyage to China. But when the first twelfth-century\r\nJapanese pilgrims reached the mainland, they were stunned to find that\r\ntraditional Buddhism had been almost completely supplanted by Ch'an.\r\nConsequently, the Japanese pilgrims returning from China perforce\r\nreturned with Zen, since little else remained. However, Zen was not\r\noriginally brought back to replace traditional Buddhism, but rather as\r\na stimulant to restore the rigor that had drained out of monastic life,\r\nincluding formal meditation and respect or discipline.7\r\n\r\nCredit for the introduction of Lin-chi Zen (called Rinzai) in Japan is\r\ntraditionally given to the aristocratic priest and traveler Myoan Eisai\r\n(1141-1215).8 He began his career as a young monk in the Tendai complex\r\nnear Kyoto, but in the summer of 1168 he accompanied a Shingon priest\r\non a trip to China, largely to sightsee and to visit the home of the\r\nT'ien-t'ai sect as a pilgrim. However, the T'ien-t'ai school must have\r\nbeen a mere shadow of its former self by this time, and naturally\r\nenough Eisai became familiar with Ch'an. But he was hardly a firebrand\r\nfor Zen, for when he returned to Japan he continued practice of\r\ntraditional Buddhism.\r\n\r\nSome twenty years later, in 1187, Eisai again journeyed to China, this\r\ntime planning a pilgrimage on to India and the Buddhist holy places.\r\nBut the Chinese refused him permission to travel beyond their borders,\r\nleaving Eisai no choice but to study there. He finally attached himself\r\nto an aging Ch'an monk on Mt. T'ien-t'ai and managed to receive the\r\nseal of enlightenment before returning to Japan in 1191, quite probably\r\nthe first Japanese ever certified by a Chinese Ch'an master. He was\r\nnot, however, totally committed to Zen. His Ch'an teacher was also\r\noccupied with other Buddhist schools, and what Eisai brought back was a\r\nBuddhist cocktail blended from several different traditions.9 But he did\r\nproceed to build a temple to the Huang-lung (Japanese Oryo) branch of\r\nthe Lin-chi sect on the southernmost Japanese island, Kyushu (the\r\nlocation nearest China), in the provincial town of Hakata. Almost as\r\nimportant, he also brought back the tea plant (whose brew was used in\r\nChina to keep drowsy monks awake during meditation), thereby\r\ninstituting the long marriage of Zen and tea.\r\n\r\nAlthough his provincial temple went unchallenged, later attempts to\r\nintroduce this new sect into Kyoto, the stronghold of traditional\r\nBuddhism, met fierce resistance from the establishment, particularly\r\nTendai. But Eisai contended that Zen was a useful sect and that the\r\ngovernment would reap practical benefits from its protection. His\r\nspirited defense of Zen, entitled \"Propagation of Zen for the\r\nProtection of the Country,\" argued that its encouragement would be good\r\nfor Japanese Buddhism and therefore good for Japan.10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_As in India, so in China its teaching has attracted followers and\r\ndisciples in great numbers. It propagates the Truth as the ancient\r\nBuddha did, with the robe of authentic transmission passing from one\r\nman to the next. In the matter of religious discipline, it practices\r\nthe genuine method of the sages of old. Thus the Truth it teaches, both\r\nin substance and appearance, perfects the relationships of master and\r\ndisciple. In its rules of action and discipline, there is no confusion\r\nof right and wrong. . . . Studying it, one discovers the key to all\r\nforms of Buddhism; practicing it, one's life is brought to fulfillment\r\nin the attainment of enlightenment. Outwardly it favors discipline over\r\ndoctrine, inwardly it brings the Highest Inner Wisdom. This is what the\r\nZen sect stands for.11\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe also pointed out how un-Japanese it would be to deny Zen a hearing:\r\nJapan has been open-minded in the past, why should she reject a new\r\nfaith now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In our country the [emperor] shines in splendor and the influence of\r\nhis virtuous wisdom spreads far and wide. Emissaries from the distant\r\nlands of South and Central Asia pay their respects to his court. Lay\r\nministers conduct the affairs of government; priests and monks spread\r\nabroad religious truth. Even the truths of the Four Hindu Vedas are not\r\nneglected. Why then reject the five schools of Zen Buddhism?12\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nEisai was the classic tactician, knowing well when to fight and when to\r\nretire, and he decided in 1199 on a diversionary retreat to Kamakura,\r\nleaving behind the hostile, competitive atmosphere of aristocratic\r\nKyoto. Through his political connections, he managed to get installed\r\nas head of a new temple in Kamakura, beginning Zen's long association\r\nwith the Japanese warrior class.\r\n\r\nEisai seems to have done well in Kamakura, for not long after he\r\narrived, the current strongman gave him financing for a Zen temple in\r\nKyoto, named Kennin-ji and completed in 1205. Eisai returned the favor\r\nby assisting in the repair of temples ravaged by the recent wars. It\r\nwas reportedly for a later, hard-drinking ruler that Eisai composed his\r\nsecond classic work, \"Drink Tea and Prolong Life,\" which championed the\r\nmedicinal properties of this exotic Chinese beverage, declaring it a\r\nrestorative that tuned up the body and strengthened the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the great country of China they drink tea, as a result of which\r\nthere is no heart trouble and people live long lives. Our country is\r\nfull of sickly-looking, skinny persons, and this is simply because we\r\ndo not drink tea. Whenever one is in poor spirits, one should drink\r\ntea. This will put the heart in order and dispel all illness. When the\r\nheart is vigorous, then even if the other organs are ailing, no great\r\npain will be felt. . . . The heart is the sovereign of the five organs,\r\ntea is the chief of the bitter foods, and bitter is the chief of the\r\ntastes. For this reason the heart loves bitter things, and when it is\r\ndoing well all the other organs are properly regulated. . . . When,\r\nhowever, the whole body feels weak, devitalized, and depressed, it is a\r\nsign that the heart is ailing. Drink lots of tea, and one's energy and\r\nspirits will be restored to full strength.13\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThis first Zen teacher was certainly no Lin-chi. He was merely a Tendai\r\npriest who imported Lin-chi's sect from China hoping to bring\r\ndiscipline to his school; he established an ecumenical monastery at\r\nwhich both Zen and esoteric Tendai practices were taught; he consorted\r\nwith leaders whose place was owed to a military coup d'etat; and he\r\nappeared to advocate Zen on transparently practical, sometimes almost\r\npolitical, grounds. He compromised with the existing cults to the end,\r\neven refusing to lend aid to other, more pure-minded advocates of Ch'an\r\nwho had risen in Kyoto in the meantime.14 But Eisai was a colorful\r\nfigure whom history has chosen to remember as the founder of Zen in\r\nJapan, as well as (perhaps equally important) the father of the cult of\r\ntea.\r\n\r\nEisai ended his days as abbot of the Kyoto temple of Kennin-ji and\r\nleader of a small Zen community that was careful not to quarrel with\r\nthe powers of Tendai and Shingon, which also had altars in the temple.\r\nEisai's \"Zen\" began in Japan as a minor infusion of Buddhism's original\r\ndiscipline, but through an accommodation with the warrior\r\nestablishment, he accidentally planted the seeds of Ch'an in fertile\r\nsoil. Gradually the number of Zen practitioners grew, as more and more\r\nof the samurai recognized in Zen a practical philosophy that accorded\r\nwell with their needs. As Paul Varley has explained: \"Zen . . .\r\nstresses cultivation of the intuitive faculties and places a high\r\npremium on discipline and self-control. It rejects rational decision-\r\nmaking as artificial and delusory, and insists that action must come\r\nfrom emotion. As such, Zen proved particularly congenial to the\r\nmedieval samurai, who lived with violence and imminent death and who\r\nsought to develop such things as 'spontaneity of conduct' and a\r\n'tranquility of heart' to meet the rigours of his profession. Under the\r\ninfluence of Zen, later samurai theorists especially asserted that the\r\ntrue warrior must be constantly prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice\r\nof his life in the service of his lord--without a moment's reflection or\r\nconscious consideration.\"15\r\n\r\nIt can only be ironic that what began in China as a school of\r\nmeditation, then became an iconoclastic movement using koans to beat\r\ndown the analytical faculties finally emerged (in an amalgam with other\r\nteachings) in Japan as a psychological mainstay for the soldiers of a\r\nmilitary dictatorship. There was, however, another Japanese school of\r\nZen that introduced its practice in a form more closely resembling\r\noriginal Ch'an. This was the movement started by Dogen, whose life we\r\nmay now examine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Sixteen\r\n\r\nDOGEN:\r\n\r\nFATHER OF JAPANESE SOTO ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soto master Dogen (1200-53) is probably the most revered figure in\r\nall Japanese Zen. Yet until recently he has been comparatively unknown\r\nabroad, perhaps because that great popularizer of Zen in the West, D.\r\nT. Suzuki, followed the Rinzai school and managed to essentially ignore\r\nDogen throughout his voluminous writings. But it was Dogen who first\r\ninsisted on intensive meditation, who produced the first Japanese\r\nwritings explaining Zen practice, and who constructed the first real\r\nZen monastery in Japan, establishing a set of monastic rules still\r\nobserved. Moreover, the strength of his character has inspired many Zen\r\nmasters to follow. Indeed, it is hard to contradict the scholar\r\nDumoulin, who declared him \"the strongest and most original thinker\r\nthat Japan has so far produced.\"1\r\n\r\nBorn January 2 of the year 1200 an illegitimate son of a noble Fujiwara\r\nmother and a princely father, Dogen's circumstances from the start were\r\naristocratic.2 Around him swirled the literary life of the court, the\r\npowerful centuries-old position of the Fujiwara, and the refined\r\ndecadence of ancient Kyoto. Although his father died when he was two,\r\nhis privileged education continued at the hands of his mother and half-\r\nbrother. He most certainly learned to read and write classical Chinese,\r\nas well as to versify and debate--all skills that he would one day put\r\nto extensive use. His poetic sensitivity (something traditionally\r\nprized by the Japanese above logic and precision of thought) was\r\nencouraged by all he met in the hothouse atmosphere of ancient Kyoto.\r\nThis idyllic, protected life was shattered at age seven with the sudden\r\ndeath of his mother. But she set the course of his life when, at the\r\nlast, she bade him become a monk and reach out to suffering mankind. A\r\npopular tradition has it that at his mother's funeral Dogen sensed in\r\nthe rising incense the impermanence of all things. After the shock of\r\nhis mother's death he was adopted by an uncle as family heir and set on\r\nthe way to a reluctant career in statecraft. But as he approached age\r\ntwelve, the time when a formal ceremony would signify his entry into\r\nthe male circle of aristocracy, his reservations overwhelmed him and he\r\nslipped away to visit another uncle, a priest living in the foothills\r\nof Mt. Hiei. When Dogen begged to be allowed to turn his back on the\r\naristocratic world of Kyoto and fulfill his mother's dying wish by\r\nbecoming a monk the family was dismayed. But finally they relented, and\r\nhe was ordained the following year as a Tendai brother on Mt. Hiei.\r\n\r\nAlready a scholar of the Chinese classics, he now turned to the\r\nliterature of Tendai Buddhism. But soon he was snagged on a problem\r\nthat has haunted theologians East and West for many centuries. In\r\nChristian terms it is the Calvinist question of whether man is already\r\nsaved by predestination or whether he must earn his salvation. Dogen\r\nformulated this in a Buddhist context as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_As I study both the exoteric and the esoteric schools of Buddhism,\r\nthey maintain that man is endowed with the Dharma-nature by birth. If\r\nthis is the case, why had the Buddhas of all ages--undoubtedly in\r\npossession of enlightenment--to seek enlightenment and engage in\r\nspiritual practice_?3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, if man already has the Buddha nature, why must he\r\nstruggle to realize it by arduous disciplines? Conversely, if the\r\nBuddha nature must be acquired, how can it be inherent in all things,\r\nas was taught?\r\n\r\nThis perplexing paradox, which no one in Japan's Tendai \"Vatican\" on\r\nMt. Hiei could resolve, finally drove Dogen wandering in search of\r\nother teachers. He initially stopped at Eisai's temple, Kennin-ji, long\r\nenough to be taught the basics of Rinzai Zen practice, but then he\r\ntraveled on. Eventually, though, he returned to Kennin-ji, and in 1217,\r\nbegan Zen study under Eisai's disciple, Myozen (1184-1225). Of his\r\nrelationship with this Rinzai master he later declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ever since I awakened to the Bodhi-mind and sought the supreme Truth I\r\nmade many visits to Buddhist masters throughout the country. It was\r\nthus that I happened to meet the Venerable Myozen at Kennin-ji. Nine\r\nyears quickly passed as I studied the Way under him. During that period\r\nI had the opportunity to learn from him, to some extent, the training\r\nmethods of the Rinzai Zen sect. To the Venerable Myozen, leading\r\ndisciple of my late master Eisai, was rightly transmitted the highest\r\nsupreme Law and he was unparalleled among his fellow disciples in\r\nlearning and virtue.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dogen may have been impressed as much by the legend of Eisai as by the\r\nshouting and beating of the Rinzai sect, for he often sprinkled stories\r\nabout Eisai through his writings and sermons thereafter.\r\n\r\nBut Dogen still could not find contentment, even with the Rinzai he\r\nreceived at Kennin-ji, and at age twenty-three he resolved to go to\r\nChina and experience Ch'an teachings firsthand. So in the spring of\r\n1223 he and Myozen shipped out for China, intending to visit Buddhist\r\nestablishments there. (Another reason for his hasty decision to go to\r\nChina for study may have been a series of political upheavals involving\r\narmed monks, which resulted in some of his high-placed relations being\r\nbanished--while a series of executions took place.)5\r\n\r\nAfter a rough but speedy voyage across the East China Sea, they arrived\r\nat Ming-chou, down the coast from the Sung capital of Hangchow. Myozen\r\ncould not wait and headed straight for the Ch'an complex on Mt. T'ien-\r\nt'ung. However, the more cautious Dogen chose to stay aboard ship until\r\nmidsummer, easing himself into Chinese life slowly. But even there he\r\nexperienced an example of Ch'an fervor and devotion that impressed him\r\ndeeply, if only because it was so different from what he had seen in\r\nJapan. This lesson was at the hands of a sixty-year-old Chinese cook\r\nfrom a Ch'an monastery who visited the ship to purchase some Japanese\r\nmushrooms. Dogen became involved in an animated conversation with the\r\nold monk and, since his monastery was over ten miles away, out of\r\ncourtesy invited him to stay the night on board ship. However, the old\r\ntenzo monk (one in charge of monastery meals) insisted on returning,\r\nsaying duty called. But, Dogen pressed, surely there must be others who\r\ncould cook in such a large monastery, and besides cooking was hardly\r\nthe point of Zen. As Dogen later recalled his own words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Venerable sir! Why don't you do_ zazen _[Zen meditation] or study the\r\nkoan of ancient masters? What is the use of working so hard as a tenzo\r\nmonk?\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing my remarks, he broke into laughter and said, \"Good\r\nforeigner! You seem to be ignorant of the true training and meaning of\r\nBuddhism.\" In a moment, ashamed and surprised at his remark, I said to\r\nhim, \"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you understand the true meaning of your question, you will have\r\nalready realized the true meaning of Buddhism,\" he answered. At that\r\ntime, however, I was unable to understand what he meant.6_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the exchanges between Japanese Buddhist scholars and Ch'an\r\nmonastery cooks in the early thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn midsummer of 1223, Dogen finally moved ashore and entered the temple\r\non Mt. T'ien-t'ung called Ching-te-ssu. His intense study brought no\r\nseal of enlightenment, but it did engender severe disappointment with\r\nthe standards of Ch'an monasteries in China. Although the school that\r\nDogen found was a branch of Lin-chi traceable back to the koan master\r\nTa-hui, different from the fading school Eisai had encountered, Dogen\r\nlater would denounce impartially the general run of all Ch'an masters\r\nhe met in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Although there are in China a great number of those who profess\r\nthemselves to be the descendants of the Buddhas and patriarchs, there\r\nare few who study truth and accordingly there are few who teach truth.\r\n. . . Thus those people who have not the slightest idea of what the\r\ngreat Way of the Buddhas and patriarchs is now become the masters of\r\nmonks. . . . Reciting a few words of Lin-chi and Yun-men they take them\r\nfor the whole truth of Buddhism. If Buddhism had been exhausted by a\r\nfew words of Lin-chi and Yun-men, it could not have survived till\r\ntoday.7\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAfter studying for two years while simultaneously nosing about other\r\nnearby monasteries, Dogen finally decided to travel, hoping others of\r\nthe \"five houses\" had maintained discipline. (He also seems to have\r\nexperienced some discrimination as a foreigner in China.) But the\r\nfarther he went, the more despondent he became; nowhere in China could\r\nhe find a teacher worthy to succeed the ancient masters. He finally\r\nresolved to abandon China and return to Japan.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment fate took a turn that--in retrospect--had enormous\r\nimportance for the future of Japanese Buddhism. A monk he met on the\r\nroad told him that T'ien-t'ung now had a new\r\n\r\nabbot, a truly enlightened master namd Ju-ching (1163-1228). Dogen\r\nreturned to see and was received warmly, being invited by Ju-ching to\r\nignore ceremony and approach him as an equal. The twenty-five-year-old\r\nJapanese monk was elated, and settled down at last to undertake the\r\nstudy he had come to China for. The master Ju-ching became Dogen's\r\nideal of what a Zen teacher should be, and the habits--perhaps even the\r\neccentricities--of this aging teacher were translated by Dogen into the\r\nmodel for monks in Japan.\r\n\r\nJu-ching was, above all things, uncompromising in his advocacy of\r\nmeditation or _zazen_. He might even have challenged Bodhidharma for\r\nthe title of its all-time practitioner, and it was from Ju-ching's\r\nCh'an (which may also have included koan study) that Dogen took his\r\ncue. Although Ch'an was still widespread, Ju-ching seems to have been\r\nthe only remaining advocate of intensive meditation in China, and a\r\nchance intersection of history brought this teaching to Japan.\r\nSignificantly, he was one of the few Ts'ao-tung masters ever to lead\r\nthe important T'ien-t'ung monastery, traditionally headed by a member\r\nof the Lin-chi school. Ju-ching was a model master: strict but kindly;\r\nsimple in habits, diet, dress; immune to the attractions of court\r\nrecognition; and an uncompromising advocate of virtually round-the-\r\nclock meditation.\r\n\r\nBut he never asked anything of his monks he did not also demand of\r\nhimself, even when advanced in years. He would strike nodding monks to\r\nrefresh their attention, while lamenting that age had so diminished the\r\nstrength in his arm it was eroding his ability to create good monks.\r\nJu-ching would meditate until eleven in the evening and then be up\r\nagain by two-thirty or three the next morning, back at _zazen_. He\r\nfrequently developed sores on his backside from such perpetual sitting,\r\nbut nothing deterred him. He even declared the pain made him love\r\n_zazen _all the more.\r\n\r\nThe story of Dogen's final enlightenment at the hands of Ju-ching is a\r\nclassic of Japanese Zen. In the meditation hall one early morning all\r\nthe monks were sitting in meditation when the man next to Dogen dozed\r\noff--a common enough occurrence in early-morning sessions. But when Ju-\r\nching came by on a routine inspection and saw the sleeping monk, he was\r\nfor some reason particularly rankled and roared out, \"_Zazen _means the\r\ndropping away of mind and body! What will you get by sleeping?\" Dogen,\r\nsitting nearby, was at first startled, but then an indescribable calm,\r\nan ecstatic joy washed over him. Could it be that this was the moment\r\nhe had been hoping for? Could it be that the fruit had been ready to\r\nfall from the tree, with this just the shake needed?\r\n\r\nDogen rushed to Ju-ching's room afterward and burned incense, to\r\nsignify his enlightenment experience. Throwing himself at the master's\r\nfeet, he declared, \"I have experienced the dropping away of mind and\r\nbody.\"\r\n\r\nJu-ching immediately recognized his enlightenment to be genuine (modern\r\nmasters reportedly can discern a novice's state merely by the way he\r\nrings a gong) and he replied, \"You have indeed dropped body and mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wait a minute,\" Dogen cautioned. \"Don't sanction me so easily. How\r\ndo you really know I've achieved enlightenment?\"\r\n\r\nTo which Ju-ching replied simply, \"Body and mind have dropped away.\"\r\n\r\nDogen bowed in acknowledgment of his acknowledgment. And thus, in May\r\n1225, was the greatest Zen teacher in Japan enlightened. In the fall\r\nJu-ching conferred upon Dogen the seal of patriarchal succession of his\r\nline of the Ts'ao-tung sect.8\r\n\r\nDogen stayed on for two more years studying under Ju-ching, but finally\r\nhe decided to return again to Japan. When they parted, Ju-ching gave\r\nhis Japanese protege the patriarchal robe, his own portrait (called\r\n_chinso_, a symbol of transmission), and bade him farewell. So did\r\nDogen return to Japan in the fall of 1227, taking with him the koan\r\ncollection _Blue Cliff Record_, which he copied his last night in\r\nChina. But he also brought the fire of a powerful idea, pure\r\nmeditation, that formed the basis for the Japanese Soto school of Zen.\r\n\r\nDogen returned to Eisai's old temple of Kennin-ji, where he proceeded\r\nto write the minor classic _A Universal Recommendation for Zazen_,\r\nintroducing the idea of intense meditation to his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_You should pay attention to the fact that even the Buddha Sakyamuni\r\nhad to practice_ zazen _for six years. It is also said that Bodhidharma\r\nhad to do _zazen _at Shao-lin temple for nine years in order to\r\ntransmit the Buddha-mind. Since these ancient sages were so diligent,\r\nhow can present-day trainees do without the practice of _zazen_? You\r\nshould stop pursuing words and letters and learn to withdraw and\r\nreflect on yourself. When you do so, your body and mind will naturally\r\nfall away, and your original Buddha-nature will appear.9\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIt was the opening shot in a campaign to make pure Zen the meaningful\r\nalternative to the decadent traditional Buddhism of the aristocracy and\r\nthe new Salvationist sect of Pure Land. But first the Japanese had to\r\nbe taught how to meditate, so he wrote a meditation \"handbook\" that\r\nexplained exactly how and where to undertake this traditional Buddhist\r\npractice. His directions are worth quoting at length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Now, in doing _zazen _it is desirable to have a quiet room. You should\r\nbe temperate in eating and drinking, forsaking all delusive\r\nrelationships. Setting everything aside, think neither of good nor\r\nevil, right nor wrong. Thus, having stopped the various functions of\r\nyour mind, give up the idea of becoming a Buddha. This holds true not\r\nonly for _zazen _but for all your daily actions.\r\n\r\nUsually a thick square mat is put on the floor where you sit and a\r\nround cushion on top of that. You may sit in either the full or half\r\nlotus position. In the former, first put your right foot on your left\r\nthigh and then your left foot on your right thigh. In the latter, only\r\nput your left foot on the right thigh. Your clothing should be worn\r\nloosely but neatly. Next, put your right hand on your left foot and\r\nyour left palm on the right palm, the tips of the thumbs lightly\r\ntouching. Sit upright, leaning to neither left nor right, front nor\r\nback. Your ears should be on the same plane as your shoulders and your\r\nnose in line with your navel. Your tongue should be placed against the\r\nroof of your mouth and your lips and teeth closed firmly. With your\r\neyes kept continuously open, breathe quietly through your nostrils.\r\nFinally, having regulated your body and mind in this way, take a deep\r\nbreath, sway your body to left and right, then sit firmly as a rock.\r\nThink of nonthinking. How is this done? By thinking beyond thinking and\r\nnonthinking. This is the very basis of _zazen_._10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis first little essay was meant to provide Japan a taste of the real\r\nZen he had experienced in China, and it was the beginning of an\r\nastounding literary output. Dogen asserted that since the Buddha had\r\nmeditated and Bodhidharma had meditated, the most valuable thing to do\r\nis meditate. Not surprisingly, he received a cold response from the\r\nother schools in Kyoto, both the Tendai sects and the other \"Zen\"\r\nteachers who, like Eisai, taught a \"syncretic\" Zen of compromise with\r\nestablishment Buddhism. His rigid doctrine was socially awkward for the\r\nsyncretic Zen monks at Kennin-ji--who seasoned their practice with\r\nchants and esoteric ceremonies--and Dogen finally decided to spare them\r\nfurther embarrassment by retiring to a mountain retreat.\r\n\r\nOff he went to another temple, An'yoin, where he began to elaborate on\r\nthe role of meditation in Zen practice, writing another essay, entitled\r\n\"Bendowa\" or \"Lecture on Training,\" designed to provide a more\r\ndialectical defense for zazen. Written in the form of eighteen\r\nquestions and answers, the \"Lecture on Training\" was intended to\r\nfurther justify the intense meditation he had described earlier. This\r\nessay later became the initial section of a massive book today known as\r\nthe _Shobogenzo _(_Treasure of Knowledge Regarding the True Dharma_),\r\nwhich was guarded as a secret treasure of the Soto school for many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Question: . . . For most people the natural way to enlightenment is to\r\nread the scriptures and recite the nembutsu [Praise to Amida Buddha].\r\nSince you do nothing more than sit cross-legged, how can this mere\r\nsitting be a means of gaining enlightenment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer: . . . Of what use is it to read the scriptures and recite the\r\n_nembutsu_? It is useless to imagine that the merits of Buddhism come\r\nmerely from using one's tongue or voice; if you think such things\r\nembrace all of Buddhism, the Truth is a long way from you. You should\r\nonly read the scriptures so as to learn that the Buddha was teaching\r\nthe necessity of gradual and sudden training and that from this you can\r\nrealise enlightenment; do not read them so as to make a show of wisdom\r\nwith useless intellection. . . . Just to continually repeat the\r\n_nembutsu_ is equally useless, for it is a frog who croaks both day and\r\nnight in some field. . . . They who do nothing . . . more than study\r\nthe scriptures . . . never understand this, so just stop it and thereby\r\ncure your delusions and doubts. Just follow the teachings of a true\r\nmaster and, through the power of _Zazen_, find the utterly joyful\r\nenlightenment of Buddha.11\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising to find Dogen firm in the belief that meditation\r\nis superior to the practices of two competing movements: the\r\ntraditional sutra veneration of the Tendai sect and the Pure Land\r\nschools' chanting of the nembutsu to Amida Buddha. But what about the\r\nRinzai Zen teaching that enlightenment is sudden and cannot be induced\r\nby gradual practice? He next attacks this position:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Question: Both in India and China, from the beginning of time to the\r\npresent day, some Zen teachers have been enlightened by such things as\r\nthe sound of stones striking bamboos, whilst the color of plum blossoms\r\ncleared the minds of others. The [Buddha] was enlightened at the sight\r\nof the morning star, whilst [his follower] Ananda understood the Truth\r\nthrough seeing a stick fall. As well as these, many Zen teachers of the\r\nfive schools after the Sixth Patriarch were enlightened by only so much\r\nas a word. Did all of them practise _Zazen_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer: From olden times down to the present day, all who were ever\r\nenlightened, either by colors or sounds, practised _Zazen _without\r\n_Zazen_ and became instantaneously enlightened.12_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is he saying here? It would seem that he is convoluting\r\nthe early teaching of the Southern sect, which proposed that\r\n\"meditation\" is a mind process that might also be duplicated by other\r\nmeans. Dogen seems to be arguing that zazen is efficacious since all\r\nwho became enlightened were really \"meditating\" in daily life, whether\r\nthey realized it or not. The Southern school claimed that _dhyana_\r\ncould be anything and therefore it seemed ancillary; Dogen claims it\r\ncould be anything and therefore it is essential.\r\n\r\nDogen also came back to his original doctrinal dilemma, the question\r\nthat had sent him wandering from teacher to teacher in Japan while\r\nstill a youth: Why strive for enlightenment if all creatures are\r\nBuddhas to begin with? He finally felt qualified to address his own\r\nquandary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Question: There are those who say that one has only to understand that\r\nthis mind itself is the Buddha in order to understand Buddhism, and\r\nthat there is no need to recite the scriptures or undergo bodily\r\ntraining. If you understand that Buddhism is inherent in yourself, you\r\nare already fully enlightened and there is no need to seek for anything\r\nfurther from anywhere. If this is so, is there any sense in taking the\r\ntrouble to practice _Zazen_?_\r\n\r\n_Answer: This is a very grievous mistake, and even if it should be true\r\nand the sages should teach it, it is impossible for you to understand\r\nit. If you would truly study Buddhism, you must transcend all opinions\r\nof subject and object. If it is possible to be enlightened simply by\r\nknowing that the self is, in its self-nature, the Buddha, then there\r\nwas no need for Shakyamuni to try so diligently to teach the Way.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whether this answer resolves the paradox will be left to the judgment\r\nof others. But for all his intensities and eccentricities, Dogen was\r\ncertainly a powerful new thinker, clearly the strongest dialectician in\r\nthe history of Japanese Zen. He was also a magnetic personality who\r\nattracted many followers, and by 1233 he had so outgrown the space at\r\nAn'yoin that a larger temple was imperative (which became available\r\nthanks to his aristocratic connections). His next move was to Kosho-ji,\r\na temple near Kyoto, where he spent the succeeding ten years in intense\r\nliterary creativity, where he constructed the first truly independent\r\nZen monastery in Japan, and where he found a worthy disciple, Koun Ejo\r\n(1198-1280), who served as head monk and ultimately as his successor.\r\nIt was here, beginning in 1233, that Dogen finally recreated Chinese\r\nCh'an totally in Japan, right down to an architectural replica of a\r\nSung-style monastery and an uncompromising discipline reminiscent of\r\nhis old Chinese master Ju-ching.\r\n\r\nAfter settling in at Kosho-ji he began, in late 1235, a fundraising\r\ndrive for the purpose of building the first Zen-style monks' hall\r\n(_sodo_) in Japan. He believed that this building, viewed by the\r\nlawgiver Po-chang Huai-hai as the heart of a Ch'an monstery, was\r\nessential if he were to effectively teach meditation. The doors would\r\nbe open to all, since the onetime aristocrat Dogen was now very much a\r\nman of the people, welcoming rich and poor, monks and laymen, men and\r\nwomen.14\r\n\r\nWhen the meditation hall opened in 1236, Dogen signaled the occasion by\r\nposting a set of rules for behavior reminiscent of Huai-hai's laws set\r\ndown in eighth-century China. A quick skim of these rules tells much\r\nabout the character of the master Dogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_No monk shall be admitted to this meditation hall unless he has an\r\nearnest desire for the Way and a strong determination not to seek fame\r\nand profit. . . . All monks in this hall should try to live in harmony\r\nwith one another, just as milk blends well with water. . . . You should\r\nnot walk about in the outside world; but if unavoidable, it is\r\npermissible to do so once a month. . . . Keep the supervisor of this\r\nhall informed of your whereabouts at all times. . . .Never speak ill of\r\nothers nor find fault with them. . . . Never loiter in the hall. . . .\r\nWear only robes of plain material. . . . Never enter the hall drunk\r\nwith wine. . . . Never disturb the training of other monks by inviting\r\noutsiders, lay or clerical, into the hall. . . .15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dogen maintained this first pure Zen monastery for a decade, during\r\nwhich time he composed forty more sections of his classic Shobogenzo.\r\nAnd during this time the tree of Zen took root in Japanese soil firmly\r\nand surely.\r\n\r\nBut things could not go smoothly forever. Dogen's powerful friends at\r\ncourt protected him as long as they could, but eventually his\r\npopularity became too much for the jealous Tendai monks on Mt. Hiei to\r\nbear. To fight their censure he appealed to the emperor, claiming (as\r\nhad Eisai before him) that Zen was good for Japan. But the other\r\nschools immediately filed opposing briefs with the emperor and the\r\ncourt, culminating in a judiciary proceeding with distinguished clerics\r\nbeing convened to hear both sides. As might have been expected they\r\nruled against Dogen, criticizing him for being obsessed with _zazen\r\n_and ignoring the sutras, etc. It probably was this political setback\r\nthat persuaded him to quit the Kyoto vicinity in 1243 and move to the\r\nprovinces, where he could teach in peace.16\r\n\r\nHe camped out in various small Tendai monasteries (where he wrote\r\nanother twenty-nine chapters of the _Shobogenzo_) until his final\r\ntemple, called Eihei-ji, or Eternal Peace, was completed in the\r\nmountains of present-day Fukui prefecture. This site became the center\r\nof Soto Zen in Japan, the principal monastery of the sect. Dogen\r\nhimself was approaching elder statesmanhood, and in 1247 he was\r\nsummoned to the warrior headquarters of Kamakura by none other than the\r\nmost powerful man in Japan, the warrior Hojo Tokiyori. The ruler wanted\r\nto learn about Zen, and Dogen correctly perceived it would be unhealthy\r\nto refuse the invitation.\r\n\r\nThe warriors in Kamakura would most likely have been familiar with the\r\nsyncretic Rinzai Zen of Eisai, which focused on the use of the koan.\r\nFor his own part, Dogen did not reject the koan out of hand (he left a\r\ncollection of three hundred); rather he judged it a device intended to\r\ncreate a momentary glimpse of satori, or enlightenment, whose real\r\nvalue was mainly as a metaphor for the enlightenment experience--an\r\nexperience he believed could be realized in full only through gradual\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the pursuit of the Way [Buddhism] the prime essential is sitting\r\n(_zazen_). . . . By reflecting upon various \"public-cases\" (koan) and\r\ndialogues of the patriarchs, one may perhaps get the sense of them but\r\nit will only result in one's being led astray from the way of the\r\nBuddha, our founder. Just to pass the time in sitting straight, without\r\nany thought of acquisition, without any sense of achieving\r\nenlightenment--this is the way of the Founder. It is true that our\r\npredecessors recommended both the koan and sitting, but it was the\r\nsitting that they particularly insisted upon. There have been some who\r\nattained enlightenment through the test of the koan, but the true cause\r\nof their enlightenment was the merit and effectiveness of sitting.\r\nTruly the merit lies in the sitting.17\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nDogen spent the winter of 1247-48 in Kamakura teaching meditation, and\r\nwas in turn offered the post of abbot in a new Zen monastery being\r\nbuilt for the warrior capital. But Dogen politely declined, perhaps\r\nbelieving the Salvationist sects and the syncretic Zen of Eisai were\r\nstill too strong among the samurai for his pure meditation to catch\r\nhold.18 Or possibly he sensed his health was beginning to fail and he\r\nwanted to retire to his beloved mountain monastery, where the politics\r\nof Kyoto and Kamakura could not reach.\r\n\r\nMaybe Dogen's many nights of intense meditation in heat and cold had\r\ntaken their toll, or the long hours of writing and rewriting his manual\r\nof Zen had sapped his strength. In any case, his health deteriorated\r\nrapidly after Kamakura until finally, in 1253, all realized that the\r\nend was near. He appointed the faithful head monk Ejo his successor at\r\nEihei-ji, and on the insistence of his disciples was then taken to\r\nKyoto for medical care. However, nothing could be done, and on August\r\n28 he said farewell, dying in the grand tradition--sitting in _zazen_.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, Dogen seems the one we should acknowledge as the true\r\nfounder of Zen in Japan; pure Zen first had to be introduced before it\r\ncould grow. But at the time of Dogen's death it was not at all obvious\r\nthat Soto Zen, or any Zen for that matter, would ever survive to become\r\nan independent sect in Japan.19 Perhaps Dogen felt this too, for his\r\nlater writings became increasingly strident in their denunciation of\r\nthe Salvationist sects and the syncretic Rinzai schools. He thought of\r\nhimself as above sectarianism, claiming that _zazen _was not a sect but\r\nrather an expression of pure Buddhism. And perhaps it was after all\r\nonly an accident that the teacher who had taught him to meditate\r\nhappened to be a member of the Ts'ao-tung school.\r\n\r\nAfter Dogen's death, his small community persevered in the mountains,\r\nisolated and at first preserving his teaching. But\r\n\r\neventually internal disputes pulled the community apart, and the temple\r\nfell inactive for a time. Furthermore, his teaching of intensive\r\nmeditation was soon diluted by the introduction of rituals from the\r\nesoteric schools of traditional Buddhism. In this new form it began to\r\nproselytize and spread outward, particularly in provincial areas, where\r\nits simplicity appealed to common folk.20 It also welcomed women,\r\nsomething not necessarily stressed in all the Buddhist sects. Although\r\nSoto was by this time pretty much a thing of the past in China, with\r\nthe last recognized Chinese Soto master dying about a century after\r\nDogen, the school prospered in Japan, where today it has three\r\nfollowers for every one of Rinzai.\r\n\r\nCh'an still had Rinzai masters in China, however, and in the next phase\r\nof Zen they would start emigrating to teach the Japanese in Kamakura.\r\nThe result was that Soto became the low-key home-grown Zen, while\r\nRinzai became a vehicle for importing Chinese culture to the warrior\r\nclass. It is to this dynamic period of warrior Rinzai Zen that we must\r\nnow look for the next great masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Seventeen\r\n\r\nIKKYU:\r\n\r\nZEN ECCENTRIC\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest Japanese masters brought Ch'an from China in the hope that\r\nits discipline would revitalize traditional Buddhism. Since Eisai's\r\ntemple was the first to include Ch'an practice, he has received credit\r\nfor founding Japanese Rinzai Zen. History, however, has glorified\r\nmatters somewhat, for in fact Eisai was little more than a Tendai\r\npriest who dabbled a bit in Ch'an practice and enjoyed a gift for\r\nadvancing himself with the Kamakura warlords. Nor was Dogen inspired to\r\nestablish the Soto sect in Japan. He too was merely a reformer who\r\nchanced across a Chinese Soto master devoted to meditation. It was the\r\npowerful discipline of meditation that Dogen sought to introduce into\r\nJapan, not a sectarian branch of Zen. Only later did Dogen's movement\r\nbecome a proselytizing Zen sect. These and other thirteenth-century\r\nJapanese reformers imported Ch'an for the simple reason that it was the\r\npurest expression of Buddhism left in China. During the early era Zen\r\nfocused on Kyoto and Kamakura and was mainly a reformation within the\r\nTendai school. The Japanese understanding of Ch'an was hesitant and\r\ninconclusive--to the point that few Japanese of the mid-thirteenth\r\ncentury actually realized a new form of Buddhism was in the making.1\r\n\r\nOver the next century and a half, however, a revolution began, as Zen\r\nat first gradually and then precipitously became the preoccupation of\r\nJapan's ruling class. The Zen explosion came about via a combination of\r\ncircumstances. We have seen that the warrior ruler Hojo Tokiyori (1227-\r\n63) was interested in the school and offered Dogen a temple in\r\nKamakura, an invitation Dogen refused. However, in 1246 an emigre Ch'an\r\nmaster from the Chinese mainland named Lan-ch'i (1212-78) appeared in\r\nJapan uninvited, having heard of Japanese interest in Ch'an. He went\r\nfirst to Kyoto, where he found Zen still subject to hostile\r\nsectarianism, and then to Kamakura, where he managed in 1249 to meet\r\nTokiyori. The Japanese strongman was delighted and proceeded to have\r\nthe temple of another sect converted to a Zen establishment, making\r\nLan-ch'i abbot. Shortly after, Tokiyori completed construction of a\r\nSung-style Zen monastery in Kamakura, again putting Lan-ch'i in charge.\r\nThis Chinese monk, merely one of many in his native China, had become\r\nhead of the leading Zen temple in Japan. When word got back, a host of\r\nenterprising Chinese clerics began pouring into the island nation\r\nseeking their fortune.2\r\n\r\nThus began the next phase of early Japanese Zen, fueled by the invasion\r\nof Chinese Ch'an monks. This movement occupied the remainder of the\r\nthirteenth century and was spurred along by unsettled conditions in\r\nChina--namely the imminent fall of the Southern Sung Dynasty to the\r\nMongols and a concurrent power struggle within Ch'an itself, which\r\ninduced monks from the less powerful establishments to seek greener\r\npastures.3 In 1263 a senior Ch'an cleric named Wu-an (1197-1276) arrived\r\nin Kamakura and was also made an abbot by Tokiyori.4 The first monk,\r\nLan-ch'i, thereupon moved to Kyoto and began proselytizing in the old\r\ncapital. Wu-an subsequently certified Tokiyori with a seal of\r\nenlightenment, making the military strongman of Japan an acknowledged\r\nCh'an master. Tokiyori's interest in Zen did not go unnoticed by the\r\nwarriors around him, and his advocacy, combined with the influx of\r\nChinese monks appearing to teach, initiated the Zen bandwagon in\r\nKamakura.\r\n\r\nTokiyori died in 1263, and his young son Tokimune (1251--84), who came\r\nto power five years later, initially showed no interest in Zen\r\npractice. But he was still in his teens in 1268 when there appeared in\r\nJapan envoys from Kublai Khan demanding tribute. The Mongols were at\r\nthat moment completing their sack of China, and Japan seemed the next\r\nstep. Undeterred, the Japanese answered all Mongol demands with haughty\r\ninsults, with the not-unexpected result that in 1274 Kublai launched an\r\ninvasion fleet. Although his ships foundered in a fortuitous streak of\r\nbad weather, the Japanese knew that there would be more. It was then\r\nthat Tokimune began strengthening his discipline through Zen meditation\r\nand toughening his instincts with koans. He studied under a newly\r\narrived Chinese master whose limited Japanese necessitated their\r\ncommunicating through a translator. (When the enlightened Chinese found\r\ncause to strike his all-powerful student, he prudently pummeled the\r\ninterpreter instead.)5 The samurai also began to take an interest in\r\nZen, which naturally appealed to the warrior mentality because of its\r\nemphasis on discipline, on experience over education, and on a rough-\r\nand-tumble practice including debates with a master and blows for the\r\nloser--all congenial to men of simple, unschooled tastes. For their own\r\npart, the perceptive Chinese missionaries, hampered by the language\r\nbarrier, rendered Zen as simplistic as possible to help the faith\r\ncompete with the Salvationist sects among the often illiterate\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nIn 1281 the Mongols launched another invasion force, this time 100,000\r\nmen strong, but they were held off several weeks by the steel-nerved\r\nsamurai until a typhoon (later named the Kamikaze or \"Divine Wind\")\r\nprovidentially sank the fleet. The extent to which Zen training aided\r\nthis victory can be debated, but the courage of Tokimune and his\r\nsoldiers undoubtedly benefited from its rigorous discipline. The\r\nJapanese ruler himself gave Zen heavy credit and immediately began\r\nbuilding a commemorative Zen monastery in Kamakura.\r\n\r\nBy the time of Tokimuni's premature death in 1284, Rinzai Zen had been\r\neffectively established as the faith of the Kamakura rulers. His\r\nsuccessor continued the development of Zen establishments, supported by\r\nnew Chinese masters who also began teaching Chinese culture\r\n(calligraphy, literature, ink painting, philosophy) to the Kamakura\r\nwarriors along with their Zen. Since the faith was definitely beginning\r\nto boom, the government prudently published a list of restrictions for\r\nZen monasteries, including an abolition of arms (a traditional problem\r\nwith the other sects) and a limit on the number of pretty boys\r\n(novices) that could be quartered in a compound to tempt the monks. The\r\nmaximum number of monks in each monastery also was prescribed, and\r\nsevere rules were established governing discipline. Out of this era in\r\nthe late thirteenth century evolved an organization of Zen temples in\r\nKyoto and Kamakura based on the Sung Chinese model of five main\r\nmonasteries (called the \"five mountains\" or _gozan_) and a network of\r\nten officially recognized subsidiary temples. Furthermore, Chinese\r\nculture became so fashionable in Kamakura that collections of Sung art\r\nbegan appearing among the illiterate provincial warriors--an early\r\nharbinger of the Japanese evolution of Zen from asceticism to\r\naesthetics.6\r\n\r\nThe creation of the _gozan _system at the end of the thirteenth century\r\ngave Zen a formal role in the religious structure of Japan. Zen was now\r\nfashionable and had powerful friends, a perfect\r\n\r\ncombination to foster growth and influence. On the sometimes pointed\r\nurging of the government, temples from other sects were converted to\r\nZen establishments by local authorities throughout Japan.7 The court and\r\naristocracy in Kyoto also began taking an interest in pure, Sung-style\r\nRinzai. Temples were built in Kyoto (or converted from other sects),\r\nand even the cloistered emperors began to meditate (perhaps searching\r\nless for enlightenment than for the rumored occult powers). When the\r\nKamakura regime collapsed in the mid-fourteenth century and warriors of\r\nthe newly ascendent Ashikaga clan returned the seat of government to\r\nKyoto, the old capital was already well acquainted with Zen's political\r\nimportance. However, although Rinzai Zen had made much visible headway\r\nin Japan--the ruling classes increasingly meditated on koans, and\r\nChinese monks operated new Sung-style monasteries--the depth of\r\nunderstanding seems disappointingly superficial overall. The _gozan\r\n_system soon turned so political, as monasteries competed for official\r\nfavor, that before long establishment Zen was almost devoid of\r\nspiritual content. In many ways, Japanese Zen became decadent almost\r\nfrom the start. The immense prestige of imported Chinese art and ideas,\r\ntogether with the powerful role of the Zen clerics as virtually the\r\nonly group sufficiently educated to oversee relations with the\r\ncontinent, meant that early on, Zen's cultural role became as telling\r\nas its spiritual place.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the condition of Zen is best illustrated by noting that the\r\nmost famous priest of the era, Muso Soseki (1275-1351), was actually a\r\npowerful political figure. This Zen prelate, who never visited China,\r\ncame to prominence when he served first an ill-fated emperor--\r\nsubsequently deposed--and later the Ashikaga warrior who deposed him.\r\nMuso was instrumental in the Japanese government's establishment of\r\nregular trade with the mainland. He was also responsible for a revision\r\nof the _gozan _administrative system, establishing (in 1338) official\r\nZen temples in all sixty-six provinces of Japan and spreading the power\r\nbase of the faith. Although Muso is today honored as an important\r\nJapanese master, he actually preferred a \"syncretic\" Zen intermingled\r\nwith esoteric rites and apparently understood very little of real Zen.\r\nA prototype for many Zen leaders to come, he was a scholar,\r\naesthetician, and architect of some of the great cultural monuments in\r\nKyoto, personally designing several of the capital's finest temples and\r\nlandscape gardens.\r\n\r\nThus by the mid-fourteenth century Zen had become hardly more than an\r\numbrella for the import of Chinese technology, art,\r\n\r\nand philosophy.8 The monks were, by Muso's own admission, more often\r\nthan not \"shaven-headed laymen\" who came to Zen to learn painting and\r\nto write a stilted form of Chinese verse as part of a _gozan _literary\r\nmovement. The overall situation has been well summarized by Philip\r\nYampolsky: \"The monks in temples were all poets and literary figures..\r\n. . [T]he use of koans, particularly those derived from the [_Blue\r\nCliff Record_], became a literary and educational device rather than a\r\nmethod for the practice of Zen.\"9 He further notes that \". . . with the\r\n_gozan _system frozen in a bureaucratic mold, priests with\r\nadministrative talents gained in ascendency. In the headquarters\r\ntemples men interested in literary pursuits withdrew completely from\r\ntemple affairs and devoted themselves exclusively to literature. To be\r\nsure, priests gave lectures and continued to write commentaries. But\r\nthe _gozan _priests seemed to concern themselves more and more with\r\ntrivialities. By the mid-fifteenth century Zen teaching had virtually\r\ndisappeared in the temples, and the priests devoted themselves mainly\r\nto ceremonial and administrative duties.\"10 Authentic Zen practice had\r\nbecome almost completely emasculated, overshadowed by the rise of a\r\nZen-inspired cultural movement far outstripping Chinese prototypes.\r\n\r\nThe political convolutions of fourteenth-century Japan, as well as the\r\norganizational shenanigans of the official Rinzai Zen sect, need not\r\ndetain us further.11 We need only note that the _gozan _system, which so\r\neffectively gave Zen an official presence throughout Japan, also meant\r\nthat the institution present was Zen in name only. Significantly,\r\nhowever, a few major monasteries elected not to participate in the\r\nofficial system. One of the most important was the Daitoku-ji in Kyoto,\r\nwhich managed, by not becoming part of the establishment, to maintain\r\nsome authenticity in its practice. And out of the Daitoku-ji tradition\r\nthere came from time to time a few Zen monks who still understood what\r\nZen was supposed to be about, who understood it was more than painting,\r\ngardens, poetry, and power. Perhaps the most celebrated of these\r\niconoclastic throwbacks to authentic Zen was the legendary Ikkyu Sojun\r\n(1394-1481).\r\n\r\nThe master Ikkyu, a breath of fresh air in the stifling, hypocritical\r\nworld of institutionalized Zen, seems almost a reincarnation of the\r\nearly Ch'an masters of the T'ang.12 However, his penchant for drinking\r\nand womanizing is more reminiscent of the Taoists than the Buddhists.\r\nHistorical information on Ikkyu and his writings is spread among\r\nvarious documents of uneven reliability. The major source is a pious\r\nchronicle allegedly compiled by his disciple Bokusai from firsthand\r\ninformation. Whereas this document has the virtue of being\r\ncontemporaneous with his life, it has the drawback of being abbreviated\r\nand selectively edited to omit unflattering facts. Then there is a\r\ncollection of tales from the Tokugawa era (1615-1868) which are heavily\r\nembellished when not totally apocryphal. The picaresque character\r\ncreated in the Tokugawa Tales led one commentator to liken Ikkyu to the\r\nfabulous Sufi philosopher-vagabond Nasrudin, who also became a vehicle\r\nto transmit folk wisdom.13 These tales seem to have developed around\r\nIkkyu simply because his devil-may-care attitude, combined with his\r\nantischolarly pose, made him a perfect peg on which to hang all sorts\r\nof didactic (not to mention Rabelaisian) anecdotes. Finally, there is a\r\nvast body of his own poetry and prose, as well as a collection of\r\ncalligraphy now widely admired for its spontaneity and power.\r\n\r\nBokusai's chronicle identifies Ikkyu's mother as a lady-in-waiting at\r\nthe imperial palace of Emperor Gokomatsu, who chose from time to time\r\nto \"show her favor.\" When she was discovered to be with child, the\r\nempress had her sent away, charging that she was sympathetic to a\r\ncompeting political faction. Consequently, the master Ikkyu was born in\r\nthe house of a commoner on New Year's Day of the year 1394, the natural\r\nson of an emperor and a daughter of the warrior class.\r\n\r\nAt age five his mother made him acolyte in a Zen monastery, a move some\r\nsuggest was for his physical safety, lest the shogun decide to do away\r\nwith this emperor's son as a potential threat. His schooling in this\r\n_gozan _era was aristocratic and classical, founded on Chinese\r\nliterature and the Buddhist sutras. By age eleven he was studying the\r\nVimalakirti Sutra and by thirteen he was intensively reading and\r\nwriting Chinese poetry. One of his works, written at age fifteen and\r\nentitled \"Spring Finery,\" demonstrates a delicate sensibility\r\nreminiscent of John Keats:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_How many passions cling to this wanderer's sleeves?\r\n\r\nMultitudes of falling blossoms mark the passion of Heaven and Earth.\r\n\r\nA perfumed breeze across my pillow; Am I asleep or awake?\r\n\r\nHere and now melt into an indistinct Spring dream.14\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe poet here has returned from a walk only to find the perfume of\r\nflowers clinging to his clothes, confusing his sense of reality and\r\nplace. It recalls Keats' nightingale--\"Fled is that music:--Do I\r\n\r\nwake or sleep?\" In this early poem we catch a glimpse of the sensualist\r\nIkkyu would one day become.\r\n\r\nAt age eighteen he became a novice to a reclusive monk of the Myoshin-\r\nji branch of Zen in Kyoto; but when his mentor died two years later he\r\nwandered for a time disconsolate and suicide-prone. Then at twenty-two\r\nhe decided to try for an interview with Kaso Soton (1352-1428), the\r\nDaitoku-ji-trained master known to be the sternest teacher in Japan. As\r\nwas traditional, the master at first shut him out and refused an\r\naudience. Ikkyu resolved to wait outside until death, \"taking the dew\r\nfor his roof and the grasses for his bed.\" He slept at night under an\r\nempty boat and stood all day in front of Kaso's retreat. After Kaso\r\nrepeatedly failed to discourage him, even once dousing him with water,\r\nthe master relented and invited Ikkyu in for an interview. They were\r\nmade for each other and for many years thereafter Ikkyu and Kaso\r\n\"pursued deep matters tirelessly.\"\r\n\r\nIkkyu came to revere Kaso, probably one of the few authentic masters of\r\nthe age, and he stayed to serve this teacher for almost a decade, even\r\nthough life with Kaso was arduous. Since they lived near a major lake,\r\nIkkyu would each night meditate in a borrowed fisherman's boat until\r\ndawn. When his purse \"went flat,\" he would journey to the capital and\r\nsell incense or cheap clothing to poor housewives--afterwards returning\r\nto the monastery in the same straw sandals, hat, and cloak.15 After\r\nthree years Kaso gave him the Zen name Ikkyu, a recognition of his\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIkkyu's enlightenment occurred in his twenty-sixth year when, while\r\nmeditating in the boat, he was startled by the cry of a crow. He rushed\r\nback at dawn and reported this to his master.\r\n\r\nKaso responded, \"You have reached the stage of an _arhat _[one who has\r\novercome ego], but not that of a Master, novice.\"\r\n\r\nIkkyu replied, \"Then I'm perfectly happy as an _arhat _and don't need\r\nto be a Master.\"\r\n\r\nKaso responded, \"Well, then, you really are a Master after all.\"16\r\n\r\nAlthough it was customary for monks to receive a certificate from their\r\nmaster attesting to their enlightenment, the matter of Ikkyu's\r\ncertificate is problematical. He himself refused to give out\r\ncertificates, and he is depicted in Bokusai's chronicle as periodically\r\ntaking out his own and requesting it be destroyed by his disciples--\r\nafter which it seemed to miraculously appear again several years later.\r\nThe quantity of invention and accretion attached to Ikkyu's\r\ndisappearing certificate has fostered speculation that he never, in\r\nfact, actually received a seal.\r\n\r\nIn any case, he probably would have destroyed his own seal of\r\nenlightenment in later years. His life grew progressively more\r\nunconventional with time, just the opposite of most. Beginning as a\r\nclassicist in the finest Kyoto tradition, he had gone on to become a\r\nspiritual recluse in the mountains under a harsh meditation master.\r\nAfter all this training he then took the road, becoming a wandering\r\nmonk in the traditional T'ang mode.\r\n\r\nWell, almost in the traditional mode. He seemed to wander into brothels\r\nand wine shops almost as often as into Zen temples. He consorted with\r\nhigh and low, merchant and commoner, male and female. Our record of\r\nthese explorations, both geographic and social, is in his writings,\r\nparticularly his poetry. He also harbored a vendetta against the\r\ncomplacency and corruption of Japanese Zen and its masters,\r\nparticularly the new abbot of Daitoku-ji, an older man named Yoso who\r\nhad once been a fellow disciple of his beloved Kaso.\r\n\r\nWhen Ikkyu was forty-six he was invited by Yoso to head a subtemple in\r\nthe Daitoku-ji compound. He accepted, much to the delight of his\r\nadmirers, who began bringing the temple donations in gratitude.\r\nHowever, after only ten days Ikkyu concluded that Daitoku-ji too had\r\nbecome more concerned with ceremony than with the preservation of Zen,\r\nand he wrote a famous protest poem as a parting gesture--claiming he\r\ncould find more of Zen in the meat, drink, and sex traditionally\r\nforbidden Buddhists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_For ten days in this temple my mind's been in turmoil,\r\n\r\nMy feet are entangled in endless red tape.\r\n\r\nIf some day you get around to looking for me,\r\n\r\nTry the fish-shop, the wine parlor, or the brothel.17\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIkkyu's attack on the commercialization of Zen was not without cause.\r\nThe scholar Jan Covell observes that in Ikkyu's time, \"Rinzai Zen had\r\nsunk to a low point and enlightenment was 'sold,' particularly by those\r\ntemples associated with the Shogunate. Zen temples also made money in\r\nsake-brewing and through usury. In the mid-fifteenth century one Zen\r\ntemple, Shokoku-ji, furnished all the advisers to the Shogunate's\r\ngovernment and received most of the bribes. The imperial-sanctioned\r\ntemple of Daitoku-ji was only on the fringe of this corruption, but\r\nIkkyu felt he could not criticize it enough.\"18\r\n\r\nIronically, Ikkyu also attacked the writing of \"Zen\" poetry--in his\r\npoems. He was really attacking the literary _gozan _movement, the\r\npreoccupation of monks who forsook Zen to concentrate on producing\r\nforgettable verse in formal Chinese. They put their poetry before,\r\nindeed in place of, Zen practice. Ikkyu used his poetry (later\r\ncollected as the \"Crazy Cloud Poems\" or _Kyoun-shu_) as a means of\r\nexpressing his enlightenment, as well as his criticism of the\r\nestablishment. It also, as often as not, celebrated sensual over\r\nspiritual pleasures.\r\n\r\nWhereas the T'ang masters created illogic and struggled with intuitive\r\ntransmission, Ikkyu cheerfully gave in to the existential life of the\r\nsenses. In the introduction to one poem he told a parable explaining\r\nhis priorities.\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was an old woman who supported a retired hermit\r\nfor some twenty years. For a long time, she sent a young girl to serve\r\nhis food. One day she told the girl to throw her arms around the monk\r\nand ask him how he felt. When the girl did so, the monk told her, \"I am\r\nlike a withered tree propped up against a cold boulder after three\r\nwinters without warmth.\" The girl went back to the old woman and made\r\nher report. \"Twenty years wasted feeding a phony layman!\" exclaimed the\r\nwoman. Then she ran him off and burnt his hut to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grandmotherly old woman tried to give that rascal a ladder.\r\n\r\nTo provide the pure monk with a nice bride.\r\n\r\nIf tonight I were to be made such a proposition,\r\n\r\nThe withered willow would put forth new spring growth.19_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA particularly lyrical exploration of sensuality is found in a poem\r\nentitled \"A Woman's [Body] has the Fragrance of Narcissus,\" which\r\ncelebrates the essence of sexuality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One should gaze long at [the fairy] hill then ascend it.\r\n\r\nMidnight on the Jade bed amid [Autumn] dreams\r\n\r\nA flower opening beneath the thrust of the plum branch.\r\n\r\nRocking gently between the fairy's thighs.20_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIkkyu's amours seem to have produced a number of natural progeny. In\r\nfact, there is the legend that one of Ikkyu's most devoted followers, a\r\nmonk named Jotei, was in fact his illegitimate son. According to the\r\nTokugawa Tales, there was a once-rich fan\r\n\r\nmaker in Sakai whose business had declined to the point that he had to\r\nsell his shop and stand on the streetcorner hawking fans. Then one day\r\nIkkyu came by carrying some fans decorated with his own famous\r\ncalligraphy and asked the man to take them on commission. Naturally\r\nthey all sold immediately and, by subsequent merchandising of Ikkyu's\r\nworks, the man's business eventually was restored. In gratitude he\r\ngranted Ikkyu his daughter, from which union sprang Ikkyu's natural\r\nson, Jotei.\r\n\r\nThis story is questionable but it does illustrate the reputation Ikkyu\r\nenjoyed, both as artist and lover. Furthermore, he wrote touching and\r\nsuspiciously fatherly poems to a little girl named Shoko.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Watching this four-year-old girl sing and dance,\r\n\r\nI feel the pull of ties that are hard to dismiss,\r\n\r\nForgetting my duties I slip into freedom.\r\n\r\nMaster Abbot, whose Zen is this_?21_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nWhen Ikkyu was in his seventies, during the disastrous civil conflict\r\nknown as the Onin war, he had a love affair with a forty-year-old\r\ntemple attendant named Mori. On languid afternoons she would play the\r\nJapanese _koto _or harp and he the wistful-sounding _shakuhachi_, a\r\nlong bamboo flute sometimes carried by monks as a weapon. This late-\r\nlife love affair occasioned a number of erotic poems, including one\r\nthat claims her restoration of his virility (called by the Chinese\r\neuphemism \"jade stalk\") cheered his disciples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_How is my hand like Mori's hand?\r\n\r\nSelf confidence is the vassal, Freedom the master.\r\n\r\nWhen I am ill she cures the jade stalk\r\n\r\nAnd brings joy back to my followers.22\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIkkyu also left a number of prose fables and sermons that portray a\r\nmore sober personality than does his often iconoclastic verse. One\r\nclassic work, written in 1457 and called \"Skeletons,\" has become a Zen\r\nclassic. In the section given below he explores the Buddhist idea of\r\nthe Void and nothingness:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Let me tell you something. Human birth is analogous to striking up a\r\nfire--the father is flint, the mother is stone and the child is the\r\nspark. Once the spark touches a lamp wick it continues to exist through\r\nthe \"secondary support\" of the fuel until that is exhausted. Then it\r\nflickers out. The lovemaking of the parents is the equivalent of\r\nstriking the spark. Since the parents too have \"no beginning,\" in the\r\nend they, too, will flicker out. Everything grows out of empty space\r\nfrom which all forms derive. If one lets go the forms then he reaches\r\nwhat is called the \"original ground.\" But since all sentient beings\r\ncome from nothingness we can use even the term \"original ground\" only\r\nas a temporary tag.23\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIt seems unfortunate that Ikkyu's prose is not better known today.24 In\r\nfact the best-known accounts of Ikkyu are the apocryphal tales that\r\nattached to him during the Tokugawa era. A typical episode is the\r\nfollowing, entitled \"Ikkyu Does Magic,\" in which the picaresque Zen-man\r\nuses his natural resources to thwart the bluster of a haughty priest\r\nfrom one of the scholarly aristocratic sects--just the thing guaranteed\r\nto please the common man.\r\n\r\nOnce Ikkyu was taking the Yodo no Kawase ferry on his way to Sakai.\r\nThere was a _yamabushi _[mountain ascetic of Esoteric Buddhism] on\r\nboard who began to question him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Hey, Your Reverence, what sect are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I belong to the Zen sect,\" replied Ikkyu.\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose your sect has miracles the way our sect does?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, actually we have lots of miracles. But if it's miracles, why don't\r\nyou show the sort of miracles that your people have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the _yamabushi_, \"By virtue of my magic powers I can pray\r\nup Fudo [a fierce guardian deity of Buddhism] before your very eyes and\r\nmake him stand right there on the prow of the boat.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, with the beads of his rosary the man began to invoke first Kongo\r\nand then Seitaka [Esoteric Buddhist deities]. At this, all the\r\npassengers began to look back and forth wondering what was going to\r\nhappen. Then, just as he had said, there on the prow of the boat, the\r\nform of Fudo appeared surrounded by a halo of dancing flames.\r\n\r\nThen the _yamabushi _made a ferocious face and told him, \"You'd all\r\nbetter offer him a prayer.\" This made the other passengers very uneasy--\r\nall that is but Ikkyu, who was completely unruffled.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" spat out the _yamabushi_, \"How about you, Zen monk? How are you\r\ngoing to deal with my miracle?\"\r\n\r\n\"By producing a miracle of my own. From my very body I will cause water\r\nto issue forth and extinguish the flames of your Fudo. You'd better\r\nstart your prayers up again.\" And Ikkyu began to pee mightily all over\r\nthe flames until at last the _yamabushi's _magic was counteracted and\r\nthe entire image melted away. Thereupon the passengers on the boat all\r\nbowed to Ikkyu for his wonderful display.25_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIronically, the real-life Ikkyu spent his twilight years restoring\r\nDaitoku-ji after its destruction (along with the rest of Kyoto) from\r\nthe ten-year Onin war (1467-77), by taking over the temple and using\r\nhis contacts in the merchant community to raise funds. He had over a\r\nhundred disciples at this time, a popularity that saddened him since\r\nearlier (and, he thought, more deserving) masters had had many fewer\r\nfollowers. Thus in the last decade of his life he finally exchanged his\r\nstraw sandals and reed hat for the robes of a prestigious abbot over a\r\nmajor monastery. His own ambivalence on this he confessed in a poem:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fifty years a rustic wanderer,\r\n\r\nNow mortified in purple robes.26\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIkkyu's contributions to Zen culture are also significant. He helped\r\ninspire the secular Zen ritual known today as the tea ceremony, by\r\nencouraging the man today remembered as its founder. He also supported\r\none of the best-known dramatists of the No theater and was himself a\r\nmaster calligrapher, an art closely akin to painting in the Far East\r\nand regarded by many as even more demanding.27 He even created a soybean\r\ndish (_natto_) now a staple of Zen monastic cuisine.\r\n\r\nBut as his biographer James Sanford has pointed out, the real life of\r\nthis truly great Japanese master has all but eluded us. His poetry is\r\nin classical Chinese and virtually unknown; his prose lies largely\r\nunread; and the Tokugawa legend of Ikkyu is almost entirely apocryphal.\r\nThis last travesty has extended even to fictionalizing his role as a\r\nchild at the monastery; there is now a popular television cartoon\r\nseries in Japan about the irrepressible acolyte Ikkyu. Sanford\r\nspeculates that his attraction for contemporary Japanese is that, in\r\nthe legend of Ikkyu, \"it is possible for the modern Japanese mind to\r\nre-discover 'native' examples of, and justification for, individualism--\r\na term and concept whose full assimilation into modern Japanese culture\r\nhas for over fifty years been blocked by a legacy of residual Neo-\r\nConfucian norms left over from [Japan's repressive past].\"28\r\n\r\nIt does seem true that the Zen-man Ikkyu represents a safety valve in\r\nJapanese society, both then and now. He brought the impulsive candor of\r\nZen to the world of affairs, demonstrating by example that after\r\nenlightenment it is necessary to return to a world where mountains are\r\nagain mountains, rivers again rivers. And by rejecting official \"Zen,\"\r\nIkkyu may well have been the most Zenlike of all Japanese masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Eighteen\r\n\r\nHAKUIN:\r\n\r\nJAPANESE MASTER OF THE KOAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing era of the Japanese middle ages, in the decades following\r\nIkkyu's death, is now known as the Century of the Country at War. Japan\r\nbecame a land of quarreling fiefdoms, and Zen, too, drifted for want of\r\nleadership and inspiration. The eventual reunification of the country\r\nlate in the sixteenth century was led by a brutal military strategist\r\nnamed Oda Nobunaga (1534-82). As part of his takeover he obliterated\r\nthe militaristic Buddhist complex on Mt. Hiei by one day simply\r\nslaughtering all its monks and burning the establishment to the ground,\r\nthereby ending permanently the real influence of Buddhism in Japanese\r\npolitics. Nobunaga was succeeded by an even more accomplished\r\nmilitarist, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-98), who brought to the shogunate\r\na flair for diplomacy and cunning compromise. Hideyoshi solidified\r\nJapan only to have yet another warlord, Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542-1616),\r\nmaneuver its rule into the hands of his own family--inaugurating the two\r\nand a half centuries of totalitarian isolationism known today as the\r\nTokugawa era (1615-1868). He also moved the capital to the city whose\r\nmodern name is Tokyo, at last leaving historic Kyoto in repose.\r\n\r\nUnder the Tokugawa a new middle class of urban merchants and craftsmen\r\narose, and with it came a version of Zen for common people, with\r\nmasters who could touch the concerns of the working class. Among these\r\nbeloved masters must certainly be remembered the monk Takuan (1573-\r\n1645) from Ikkyu's rebuilt Daitoku-ji temple, who introduced Zen\r\nteachings to this new audience, and the wandering teacher Bankei (1622-\r\n93), whose kindly, mystical interpretation of oneness through _zazen\r\n_earned him wide fame. Overall, however, Rinzai Zen remained\r\nspiritually dormant until the middle of the Tokugawa era, when there\r\nappeared one of the most truly inspired Zen teachers of all time.\r\n\r\nThe master Hakuin (1686-1769) was born as Sugiyama Iwajiro in Hara, a\r\nsmall village at the base of Mt. Fuji. He was the youngest of five\r\nchildren in a family of modest means, an origin that may have helped\r\nhim understand the concerns of the poor. As he tells his story, he was\r\nseven or eight when his mother took him to hear a priest from the\r\nSalvationist Nichiren sect preach on the tormenting Buddhist hells. He\r\nwas terrified and secretly began day and night reciting the Lotus Sutra\r\n(which claims to protect from the perils of fire or water those who\r\nchant the proper incantation). The fear of hell, with its boiling\r\ncaldrons, so permeated his young mind that he even became leary of the\r\ntraditional Japanese bath, then often taken in a round tub fired from\r\nthe bottom with wood. He claimed this fear of the bath finally\r\nconvinced him to become a monk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One day when I was taking a bath with my mother, she asked that the\r\nwater be made hotter and had the maid add wood to the fire. Gradually\r\nmy skin began to prickle with the heat and the iron bath-cauldron began\r\nto rumble. Suddenly I recalled the descriptions of the hells that I had\r\nheard and I let out a cry of terror that resounded through the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on I determined to myself that I would leave home to\r\nbecome a monk. To this my parents would not consent, yet I went\r\nconstantly to the temple to recite the sutras. . . .1_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut after several years of study and chanting, he was dismayed to find\r\nhe still felt pain (when he tested himself one day with a hot poker).\r\nHe resolved to intensify his devotion and at age fifteen he entered a\r\nlocal Zen temple (against his parents' wishes) and was ordained as a\r\nmonk. Hakuin pursued his study of the Lotus Sutra, the primary\r\nscripture venerated at this temple (an illustration of how far Japanese\r\nZen had traveled from its tradition of meditation and koans), but after\r\na year he concluded it was just another book, no different from the\r\nConfucian classics. He therefore began to drift from temple to temple\r\nuntil, at nineteen, he experienced another spiritual crisis. In a book\r\nof religious biographies he came across the story of the Chinese monk\r\nYen-t'ou (828-87), who had been attacked and murdered by bandits,\r\ncausing him to emit screams heard a full three miles away. Hakuin was\r\nplunged into depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_I wondered why such an enlightened monk was unable to escape the\r\nswords of thieves. If such a thing could happen to a man who was like a\r\nunicorn or phoenix among monks, a dragon in the sea of Buddhism, how\r\nwas I to escape the staves of the demons of hell after I died? What use\r\nwas there in studying Zen_?2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe thereupon took up his staff and set out as an itinerant seeker, only\r\nto meet disappointment after disappointment--until finally he decided to\r\nput his future in the hands of chance. One day as the abbot of a temple\r\nwas airing its library outside, Hakuin decided to select a book at\r\nrandom and let it decide his fate. He picked a volume of biographies of\r\nChinese Ch'an worthies and opening it read of an eleventh-century Lin-\r\nchi master who kept awake in meditation by boring into his own thigh\r\nwith a wood drill. The story galvanized Hakuin, and he vowed to pursue\r\nZen training until enlightenment was his.\r\n\r\nHakuin claims that at age twenty-four he had his first really moving\r\nsatori experience. He was in a temple in Niigata prefecture, meditating\r\non the \"Mu\" koan (Q: \"Does a dog have Buddha-nature? A: \"Mu!\"), and so\r\nintense was his concentration that he even forgot sleeping and eating.\r\nThen one day . . .\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great doubt manifested itself before me. It was as though I\r\nwere frozen solid in the midst of an ice sheet extending tens of\r\nthousands of miles. A purity filled my breast and I could neither go\r\nforward nor retreat. To all intents and purposes I was out of my mind\r\nand the _Mu _alone remained. Although I sat in the Lecture Hall and\r\nlistened to the Master's lecture, it was as though I were hearing a\r\ndiscussion from a distance outside the hall. At times it felt as though\r\nI were floating through the air.\r\n\r\nThis state lasted for several days. Then I chanced to hear the sound of\r\nthe temple bell and I was suddenly transformed. It was as if a sheet of\r\nice had been smashed or a jade tower had fallen with a crash.3_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElated with his transformation, he immediately trekked back to an\r\nearlier master and presented a verse for approval. The master, however,\r\nwas not impressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Master, holding my verse up in his left hand, said to me: \"This\r\nverse is what you have learned from study. Now show me what your\r\nintuition has to say,\" and he held out his right hand.\r\n\r\nI replied: \"If there were something intuitive that I could show you,\r\nI'd vomit it out,\" and I made a gagging sound.\r\n\r\nThe Master said: \"How do you understand Chao-chou's _Mu_?\"\r\n\r\nI replied: \"What sort of place does _Mu _have that one can attach arms\r\nand legs to it?\"\r\n\r\nThe Master twisted my nose with his fingers and said: \"Here's some\r\nplace to attach arms and legs.\" I was nonplussed and the Master gave a\r\nhearty laugh.4\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nAgain and again he tried to extract a seal from this master, but always\r\nin vain. One of these fruitless exchanges even left him lying in a mud\r\npuddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One evening the Master sat cooling himself on the veranda. Again I\r\nbrought him a verse I had written. \"Delusions and fancies,\" the Master\r\nsaid. I shouted his words back at him in a loud voice, whereupon the\r\nMaster seized me and rained twenty or thirty blows with his fists on\r\nme, and then pushed me off the veranda.\r\n\r\nThis was on the fourth day of the fifth month after a long spell of\r\nrain. I lay stretched out in the mud as though dead, scarcely breathing\r\nand almost unconscious. I could not move; meanwhile the Master sat on\r\nthe veranda roaring with laughter.5\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe finally despaired of receiving the seal of enlightenment from this\r\nteacher, although he did have further spiritual experiences under the\r\nman's rigorous guidance--experiences Hakuin interpreted, perhaps\r\nrightly, as _satori_. Feeling wanderlust he again took to the road,\r\neverywhere experiencing increasingly deep _satori_. In southern Ise he\r\nwas enlightened when suddenly swamped in a downpour. Near Osaka he was\r\nfurther enlightened one evening in a temple monks' hall by the sound of\r\nfalling snow. In Gifu prefecture he had an even deeper experience\r\nduring walking meditation in a monks' hall. He also had a mental and\r\nphysical collapse about this time, no doubt resulting from the strain\r\nof his intensive asceticism. After his father's death in 1716, he\r\nstudied in Kyoto for a time, but the next year he returned to the\r\nShoin-ji temple near his original home at Hara. Weary of life at\r\nthirty-two, he still was undecided about his future. Back at the temple\r\nwhere he had started, he no longer had any idea of what to do. Then a\r\nrevelation appeared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_One night in a dream my mother came and presented me with a purple\r\nrobe made of silk. When I lifted it, both sleeves seemed very heavy,\r\nand on examining them I found an old mirror, five or six inches in\r\ndiameter, in each sleeve. The reflection from the mirror in the right\r\nsleeve penetrated to my heart and vital organs. My own mind, mountains\r\nand rivers, the great earth seemed serene and bottomless. . . . After\r\nthis, when I looked at all things, it was as though I were seeing my\r\nown face. For the first time I understood the meaning of the saying,\r\n\"The [enlightened spirit] sees the Buddha-nature within his eye._\"6_\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nWith this dream he finally achieved full _satori_. He resolved that the\r\nold ramshackle temple would be his final home. He had found\r\nenlightenment there and there he would stay, his own master at last.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, Hakuin never moved again. Instead, the people of\r\nJapan--high and low--came to see him. His simple country temple became a\r\nmagnet for monks and laymen seeking real Zen. By force of his own\r\ncharacter, and most certainly without his conscious intention, he\r\ngradually became the leading religious figure in Japan. By the end of\r\nhis life he had brought the koan practice back to a central place in\r\nZen and had effectively created modern Rinzai.\r\n\r\nHakuin was the legitimate heir of the Chinese koan master Ta-hui, and\r\nthe first teacher since to actually expand the philosophical dimensions\r\nof Zen. It will be recalled that Ta-hui advocated \"Introspecting-the-\r\nKoan\" meditation, called _k'an-hua _Ch'an in Chinese and Kanna Zen in\r\nJapanese, which he put forth in opposition to the \"Silent Illumination\"\r\nmeditation of the Soto school. Hakuin himself claimed that he first\r\ntried the quietistic approach of tranquil meditation (albeit on a\r\nkoan), but he was unable to clear his mind of all distractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_When I was young the content of my koan meditation was poor. I was\r\nconvinced that absolute tranquility of the source of the mind was the\r\nBuddha Way. Thus I despised activity and was fond of quietude. I would\r\nalways seek out some dark and gloomy place and engage in dead sitting.\r\nTrivial and mundane matters pressed against my chest and a fire mounted\r\nin my heart. I was unable to enter wholeheartedly into the active\r\npractice of Zen.7\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nThus Hakuin concluded that merely following Ta-hui's injunction to\r\nmeditate on a koan was not the entire answer. He then decided the only\r\nway that Zen could be linked meaningfully to daily life was if a\r\npractitioner could actually meditate while going about daily affairs.\r\n\r\nThis idea was rather radical, although it probably would not have\r\nunduly disturbed the T'ang masters. Hakuin was again extending both the\r\ndefinition of enlightenment, as it intersects with the real world, and\r\nthe means of its realization. He was saying to meditate on a koan in\r\nsuch a manner that you can continue your daily life but be oblivious to\r\nits distractions. He invoked the Chinese masters to support the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Zen Master Ta-hui has said that meditation in the midst of\r\nactivity is immeasurably superior to the quietistic approach. . . .\r\nWhat is most worthy of respect is a pure koan meditation that neither\r\nknows nor is conscious of the two aspects, the quiet and the active.\r\nThis is why it has been said that the true practicing monk walks but\r\ndoes not know he is walking, sits but does not know he is sitting.8\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHakuin redefined meditation to include a physically active aspect as\r\nwell as merely a quiet, sitting aspect. And under this new definition\r\nanyone, even laymen, could meditate at any time, in any place. Hakuin\r\ndid not exclude sitting in meditation; he tried to broaden the\r\ndefinition to include the kind of thing he believed would really\r\nproduce meaningful enlightenment. In addition, meditation in action\r\ntakes away the excuse of most laymen for not practicing introspection--\r\nand what is more, it brings respect from others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do not say that worldly affairs and pressures of business leave you no\r\ntime to study Zen under a Master, and that the confusions of daily life\r\nmake it difficult for you to continue your meditation. Everyone must\r\nrealize that for the true practicing monk there are no worldly cares or\r\nworries. Supposing a man accidentally drops two or three gold coins in\r\na crowded street swarming with people. Does he forget about the money\r\nbecause all eyes are upon him? ... A person who concentrates solely on\r\nmeditation amid the press and worries of everyday life will be like the\r\nman who has dropped the gold coins and devotes himself to seeking them.\r\nWho will not rejoice in such a person_?9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHakuin realized that meditating in the middle of distractions was\r\ninitially more difficult--with fewer short-term rewards--than sitting\r\nquietly alone. However, if you want to make the heightened awareness of\r\nZen a part of your life, then you must meditate in daily life from the\r\nvery first. Just as you cannot learn to swim in the ocean by sitting in\r\na tub, you cannot relate your Zen to the world's pressures, stress, and\r\ntensions if it is forever sheltered in silent, lonely isolation. If\r\nthis is difficult at first, persevere and look toward the ultimate\r\nrewards.\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nFrequently you may feel that you are getting nowhere with practice in\r\nthe midst of activity, whereas the quietistic approach brings\r\nunexpected results. Yet rest assured that those who use the quietistic\r\napproach can never hope to enter into meditation in the midst of\r\nactivity. Should by chance a person who uses this approach enter into\r\nthe dusts and confusions of the world of activity, even the power of\r\nordinary understanding which he had seemingly attained will be entirely\r\nlost. Drained of all vitality, he will be inferior to any mediocre,\r\ntalentless person. The most trivial matters will upset him, an\r\ninordinate cowardice will afflict his mind, and he will frequently\r\nbehave in a mean and base manner. What can you call accomplished about\r\na man like this_?10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuietistic meditation is easier, naturally, but a person who practices\r\nit will turn out to be just as insecure and petty as someone not\r\nenlightened at all. What is equally important, \"leisure-time\"\r\nmeditation that separates our spiritual life from our activities is\r\nmerely hiding from reality. You cannot come home from the job and\r\nsuddenly turn on a meditation experience. He cites the case of someone\r\nwho excuses himself to meditate, but who is then so harried and tense\r\nit does no good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Even should there be such a thing as . . . reaching a state where the\r\ngreat illumination is released by means of dead sitting and silent\r\nillumination . . . people are so involved in the numerous duties of\r\ntheir household affairs that they have scarcely a moment in which to\r\npractice concentrated meditation. What they do then is to plead illness\r\nand, neglecting their duties and casting aside responsibilities for\r\ntheir family affairs, they shut themselves up in a room for several\r\ndays, lock the door, arrange several cushions in a pile, set up a stick\r\nof incense, and proceed to sit. Yet, because they are exhausted by\r\nordinary worldly cares, they sit in meditation for one minute and fall\r\nasleep for a hundred, and during the little bit of meditation that they\r\nmanage to accomplish, their minds are beset by countless delusions.11\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBut what is worse, these people then blame their careers, assuming they\r\nneed more isolation. But this is like the aspiring ocean swimmer in the\r\ntub mistakenly desiring less water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_[They] furrow their brows, draw together their eyebrows, and before\r\none knows it they are crying out: \"Our official duties interfere with\r\nour practice of the Way; our careers prevent our Zen meditation. It\r\nwould be better to resign from office, discard our seals, go to some\r\nplace beside the water or under the trees where all is peaceful and\r\nquiet and no one is about, there in our own way to practice _dhyana\r\n_contemplation, and escape from the endless cycle of suffering.\" How\r\nmistaken these people are_!12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving determined meditation in the midst of activity is the only\r\nmeaningful practice, he next addressed the question of how to go about\r\nit. He explained that we can do it by making our activities into\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_What is this true meditation? It is to make everything: coughing,\r\nswallowing, waving the arms, motion, stillness, words, action, the evil\r\nand the good, prosperity and shame, gain and loss, right and wrong,\r\ninto one single koan.13\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHe gave an example of how to change the implements of daily living into\r\na Buddhist metaphor, in this case by a warrior's making his clothes,\r\nsword, and saddle into a meditation hall of the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Make your skirt and upper garments into the seven- or nine- striped\r\nmonks' robe; make your two-edged sword into your resting board or desk.\r\nMake your saddle your sitting cushion; make the mountains, rivers, and\r\ngreat earth the sitting platform; make the whole universe your own\r\npersonal meditation cave. . . . Thrusting forth the courageous mind\r\nderived from faith, combine it with the true practice of\r\nintrospection.14\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nIf meditation bears no relationship to life, what good is it? It is\r\nmerely self-centered gratification. This he condemned, pointing out\r\nthat if everyone did nothing but meditate on his own inner concerns,\r\nsociety at large would fall apart. And ultimately Zen would be blamed.\r\nFurthermore, this inner-directed preoccupation with self-awareness is\r\nbad Zen.\r\n\r\nHakuin similarly taught that a Zen which ignored society was hollow and\r\nmeaningless, and its monks of no use to anybody. He was particularly\r\nstern with conventional Zen students, who were content in their own\r\nenlightenment and ignored the needs of others. \"Meditation in action\"\r\nfor the monk meant the same as for a layman, with one significant\r\ndifference. Whereas the layman could bring meditation to his obligatory\r\nlife of affairs, the monk must bring the life of the world to his\r\nmeditation. Just to hide and meditate on your own original nature\r\nproduces inadequate enlightenment, while also shutting you off from any\r\nchance to help other people, other sentient beings. The ancient masters\r\nknew, said Hakuin, that a person truly enlightened could travel through\r\nthe world and not be distracted by the so-called five desires (wealth,\r\nfame, food, sleep, and sex). The enlightened being is aware of, but not\r\nenticed by, sensual gratification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Third Patriarch [Seng-ts'an, d. 606] has said: \"If one wishes to\r\ngain true intimacy with enlightenment, one must not shun the objects of\r\nthe senses.\" He does not mean here that one is to delight in the\r\nobjects of the senses but, just as the wings of a waterfowl do not get\r\nwet even when it enters the water, one must establish a mind that will\r\ncontinue a true koan meditation without interruption, neither clinging\r\nto nor rejecting the objects of the senses.15\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBut Hakuin asked something of a Zen novice even more difficult than\r\nthat asked by the Chinese masters of old--who merely demanded that a\r\nmonk reject the world, turn his back, and shut out its distractions. In\r\ncontrast, Hakuin insists that he meditate while out in the world,\r\nactively immersing himself in its attractions. The older Ch'an masters\r\nadvised a monk to ignore the world, to treat it merely as a backdrop to\r\nhis preoccupation with inner awareness; Hakuin says to test your\r\nmeditation outside, since otherwise it serves for nothing. And today\r\nRinzai monks are expected to silently meditate during all activities,\r\nincluding working in the yard of the monastery, harvesting vegetables,\r\nor even walking through the town for their formal begging.\r\n\r\nHakuin not only redefined meditation, he also revitalized koan practice\r\namong full-time Zen monks and ultimately brought on a renaissance of\r\nRinzai Zen itself. He formalized the idea of several stages of\r\nenlightenment (based on his own experience of increasingly deep satori)\r\nas well as a practice that supported this growth. But most of all\r\nHakuin was dismayed by what he considered to be the complete\r\nmisunderstanding of koan practice in Japan. Monks had memorized so many\r\nanecdotes about the ancient Chinese masters that they thought they\r\ncould signify the resolution of a koan by some insincere theatrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_[0]f the monks who move about like clouds and water, eight or nine out\r\nof ten will boast loudly that they have not the slightest doubt about\r\nthe essential meaning of any of the seventeen hundred koans that have\r\nbeen handed down. . . . If you test them with one of these koans, some\r\nwill raise their fists, others will shout \"_katsu_,\" but most of them\r\nwill strike the floor with their hands. If you press them just a little\r\nbit, you will find that they have in no way seen into their own\r\nnatures, have no learning whatsoever, and are only illiterate, boorish,\r\nsightless men.16\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHakuin breathed new life back into koan theory. For instance, he seems\r\nthe first Japanese master to take a psychological interest in the koan\r\nand its workings. He believed a koan should engender a \"great doubt\" in\r\nthe mind of a novice, and through this great doubt lead him to the\r\nfirst enlightenment or _kensho_.17 Initially he had advocated the \"Mu\"\r\nkoan for beginners, but late in life he came up with the famous \"What\r\nis the sound of one hand clapping?\"18 As he described this koan in a\r\nletter to a laywoman:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_What is the Sound of the Single Hand? When you clap together both\r\nhands a sharp sound is heard; when you raise the one hand there is\r\nneither sound nor smell. . . .\r\n\r\nThis is something that can by no means be heard with the ear. If\r\nconceptions and discriminations are not mixed within it and it is quite\r\napart from seeing, hearing, perceiving, and knowing, and if, while\r\nwalking, standing, sitting, and reclining, you proceed\r\nstraightforwardly without interruption in the study of this koan, then\r\nin the place where reason is exhausted and words are ended, you will\r\nsuddenly . . . break down the cave of ignorance.. . . At this time the\r\nbasis of mind, consciousness, and emotion is suddenly shattered.19\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nBut this is not the end; rather it is the beginning. After a disciple\r\nhas penetrated this koan, he receives koans of increasing difficulty.\r\nFrom Hakuin's own experience he knew that _satori _experiences could be\r\nrepeated and could become ever deeper and more meaningful. Although he\r\nhimself never chose to overtly systematize and categorize koans, his\r\nheirs did not hesitate to do so, creating the structure that is modern\r\nRinzai Zen.\r\n\r\nHow did Zen finally emerge, after all the centuries and the\r\nconvolutions? As Hakuin's descendants taught Zen, a monk entering the\r\nmonastery was assigned a koan chosen by the master. He was expected to\r\nmeditate on this koan until his _kensho_, his first glimmer of satori,\r\nwhich might require two to three years. After this a new phase of study\r\nbegan. The monk was then expected to work his way through a program of\r\nkoans, requiring as much as a decade more, after which he might\r\nmeditate on his own, in seclusion, for a time longer.20\r\n\r\nThe master worked with monks individually (a practice reputedly left\r\nover from the time when Chinese-speaking masters had to communicate in\r\nwriting) via a face-to-face interview (_senzen_) reminiscent of a\r\nMarine Corps drill instructor harassing a recruit. The monk would bow\r\nto the master, seat himself, and\r\n\r\nsubmit his attempt at resolution of the koan. The master might either\r\nacknowledge his insight, give him some oblique guidance, or simply\r\ngreet him with stony silence and ring for the next recruit--signifying\r\nan unsatisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nHakuin made his disciples meditate; he made them struggle through koan\r\nafter koan; he made monastic discipline as rigorous as possible; and he\r\ntaught that it is not enough merely to be interested in yourself and\r\nyour own enlightenment. But he insisted that if you follow all his\r\nteachings, if you meditate the right way and work through increasingly\r\ndifficult koans, you too can find the enlightenment he found, an\r\nenlightenment that expressed itself in an enormous physical vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Even though I am past seventy now my vitality is ten times as great as\r\nit was when I was thirty or forty. My mind and body are strong and I\r\nnever have the feeling that I absolutely must lie down to rest. Should\r\nI want to I find no difficulty in refraining from sleep for two, three,\r\nor even seven days, without suffering any decline in my mental powers.\r\nI am surrounded by three- to five-hundred demanding students, and even\r\nthough I lecture on the scriptures or on the collections of the\r\nMasters' sayings for thirty to fifty days in a row, it does not exhaust\r\nme.21\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\nHakuin was a prolific writer and always aware of his audience. For his\r\nlay followers, he wrote in simple Japanese and related his teachings to\r\nthe needs and limitations of secular life. For his monk disciples he\r\nwrote in a more scholarly style. And finally, we have many long elegant\r\nletters composed for various dignitaries of government and the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nHe also was an artist of note, producing some of the most powerful Zen-\r\nstyle paintings of any Japanese. Like his writings, these works are\r\nvigorous, impulsive, and dynamic. He seems to have been an inspiration\r\nfor many later Zen artists, including Sengai (1750-1837) and the Zen\r\npoet Ryokan (1758-1831).22\r\n\r\nHakuin died in his sleep at age eighty-three. During his life he had\r\nreestablished Rinzai Zen in Japan in a form fully as rigorous as ever\r\npracticed in the monasteries of T'ang and Sung China, and he had\r\nsimultaneously discovered a way this Zen could be made accessible to\r\nlaymen, through meditation in activity. Whereas previous Japanese\r\nteachers had let koan practice atrophy in order to attract a greater\r\nnumber of followers, Hakuin simultaneously made Zen both more authentic\r\nand more popular. His genius thereby saved traditional Zen in its\r\nclassical form, while at last making it accessible and meaningful in\r\nmodern life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Nineteen\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the resilience of Zen that has allowed it to survive and\r\nflourish over all the centuries, even though frequently at odds\r\nphilosophically with its milieu? And why have the insights of obscure\r\nrural teachers from the Chinese and Japanese Middle Ages remained\r\npertinent to much of modern life in the West? On the other hand, why\r\nhas there been a consistent criticism of Zen (from early China to the\r\npresent day) condemning it as a retreat from reality--or worse, a\r\npreoccupation with self amidst a world that calls for social\r\nconscience?\r\n\r\nThese questions are complex, but they should be acknowledged in any\r\ninquiry into Zen thought. They are also matters of opinion: those\r\nwishing to see Zen as unwholesome are fixed in their critical views,\r\njust as those committed to Zen practice are unshakably steadfast. What\r\nfollows is also opinion, even though an attempt has been made to\r\nmaintain balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL CONSCIENCE IN ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA distinguished modern Zen master was once asked if Zen followers\r\nlooked only inward, with no concern for others. He replied that in Zen\r\nthe distinction between oneself and the world was the first thing to be\r\ndissolved. Consequently, mere self-love is impossible; it resolves\r\nnaturally into a love of all things. Stated in this way, Zen teachings\r\nbecome, in a twinkling, a profound moral philosophy. Where there is no\r\ndistinction between the universe and ourselves, the very concept of the\r\nego is inappropriate. We cannot think of ourselves without\r\nsimultaneously thinking of others. Zen is not, therefore, an obsession\r\nwith the self, but rather an obsession with the universe, with all\r\nthings--from nature to the social betterment of all. Although Zen\r\ninitially forces a novice to focus on his own mind, this is only to\r\nenable him or her to attain the insight to merge with all things, great\r\nand small. True Zen introspection eventually must lead to the\r\ndissolution of the self. When this occurs, we no longer need the\r\nchiding of a Golden Rule.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to question whether this particular view of social\r\nconscience, which might be described as more \"passive\" than \"active,\"\r\nadequately refutes the charge of \"me-ism\" in Zen. But perhaps less is\r\nsometimes more in the long run. There is no great history of Zen\r\ncharity, but then there have been few if any bloody Zen Crusades and\r\nlittle of the religious persecution so common to Western moral systems.\r\nPerhaps the humanism in Zen takes a gentler, less flamboyant form. In\r\nthe scales of harm and help it seems as noble as any of the world's\r\nother spiritual practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZEN AND CREATIVITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZen gained from Taoism the insight that total reliance on logical\r\nthought stifles the human mind. Logic, they found, is best suited to\r\nanalyzing and categorizing--functions today increasingly delegated to\r\nthe computer. Whereas the logical mode of thought can only manipulate\r\nthe world view of given paradigm, intuition can inspire genuine\r\ncreativity, since it is not shackled by the nagging analytical mind,\r\nwhich often serves only to intimidate imaginative thought. Zen\r\nstruggled relentlessly to deflate the pomposity of man's rationality,\r\nthereby releasing the potential of intuition. Although much research\r\nhas arisen in recent times to pursue the same effect--from\r\n\"brainstorming\" to drugs--Zen challenged the problem many centuries ago,\r\nand its powerful tools of meditation and the koans still taunt our\r\nmodern shortcuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZEN AND MIND RESEARCH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Zen ideas should find a place in psychoanalysis is not surprising.\r\nMeditation has long been used to still the distraught mind. Japanese\r\nresearchers have studied the effects of meditation on brain activity\r\nfor many years, and now similar studies are also underway in the West.\r\nThe connection between Zen \"enlightenment\" and a heightened state of\r\n\"consciousness\" has been examined by psychologists as diverse as Erich\r\nFromm and Robert Ornstein. But perhaps most significantly, our recent\r\nresearch in the hemispheric specialization of the brain--which suggests\r\nour left hemisphere is the seat of language and rationality while the\r\nright dominates intuition and creativity-- appears to validate\r\ncenturies-old Zen insights into the dichotomy of thought. Zen\r\n\"research\" on the mind's complementary modes may well light the path to\r\na fuller understanding of the diverse powers of the human mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZEN AND THE ARTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt times the ancient Chinese and Japanese art forms influenced by Zen\r\nseem actually to anticipate many of the aesthetic principles we now\r\ncall \"modern.\" Sixteenth-century Zen ceramics could easily pass as\r\ncreations of a contemporary potter, and ancient Chinese and Japanese\r\ninks and calligraphies recall the modern monochrome avant-garde. Zen\r\nstone gardens at times seem pure abstract expressionism, and the Zen-\r\ninfluenced landscape gardens of Japan can manipulate our perception\r\nusing tricks only recently understood in the West. Japanese haiku\r\npoetry and No drama, created under Zen influence, anticipate our modern\r\ndistrust of language; and contemporary architecture often echoes\r\ntraditional Japanese design--with its preference for clean lines, open\r\nspaces, emphasis on natural materials, simplicity, and the integration\r\nof house and garden.\r\n\r\nAesthetic ideals emerging from Zen art focus heavily on naturalness, on\r\nthe emphasis of man's relation to nature. The Zen artists, as do many\r\nmoderns, liked a sense of the materials and process of creation to come\r\nthrough in a work. But there is a subtle difference. The Zen artists\r\nfrequently included in their works devices to ensure that the message\r\nreached the viewer. For example, Zen ceramics are always intended to\r\nforce us to experience them directly and without analysis. The trick\r\nwas to make the surface seem curiously imperfect, almost as though the\r\nartist were careless in the application of a finish, leaving it uneven\r\nand rough. At times the glaze seems still in the process of flowing\r\nover a piece, uneven and marred by ashes and lumps. There is no sense\r\nof \"prettiness\": instead they feel old and marred by long use. But the\r\nartist consciously is forcing us to experience the piece for itself,\r\nnot as just another item in the category of bowl. We are led into the\r\nprocess of creation, and our awareness of the piece is heightened--just\r\nas an unfinished painting beckons us to pick up a brush, This device of\r\ndrawing us into involvement, common to Zen arts from haiku to ink\r\npainting, is one of the great insights of Zen creativity, and it is\r\nsomething we in the West are only now learning to use effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZEN AND PERCEPTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the major insights of Zen is that the world should be perceived\r\ndirectly, not as an array of embodied names. As noted, the Zen arts\r\nreinforce this attitude by deliberately thwarting verbal or analytical\r\nappreciation. We are forced to approach them with our logical faculties\r\nin abeyance. This insistence on direct perception is one of the\r\ngreatest gifts of Zen. No other major system of thought champions this\r\ninsight so clearly and forthrightly. Zen would have our perception of\r\nthe world, indeed our very thoughts, be nonverbal. By experiencing\r\nnature directly, and by thinking in pure ideas rather than with\r\n\"internalized speech,\" we can immeasurably enrich our existence. The\r\ndawn, the flower, the breeze are now experienced more exquisitely--in\r\ntheir full reality. Zen worked hard to debunk the mysterious power we\r\nmistakenly ascribe to names and concepts, since the Zen masters knew\r\nthese serve only to separate us from life. Shutting off the constant\r\nbabble in our head is difficult, but the richness of experience and\r\nimagery that emerges is astounding. It is as though a screen between us\r\nand our surroundings has suddenly dropped away, putting us in touch\r\nwith the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ZEN LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart of Zen is practice, \"sitting,\" physical discipline. For those\r\nwishing to experience Zen rather than merely speculate about it, there\r\nis no other way. Koans can be studied, but without the guidance of\r\npractice under a master, they are hardly more than an intellectual\r\nexercise. Only in formal meditation can there be the real beginning of\r\nunderstanding. Zen philosophy, and all that can be transmitted in\r\nwords, is an abomination to those who really understand. There's no\r\nescaping the Taoist adage, \"Those who speak do not know, those who know\r\ndo not speak.\" Words can point the way, but the path must be traveled\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n                                    *    *    *\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tChang Chung-yuan, Tao: A New Way of Thinking (New York: Perennial\r\nLibrary, 1977), p. 4.\r\n\r\n2.\tIbid., p. 6.\r\n\r\n3.\tIbid., p. 50.\r\n\r\n4.\tIbid., p. 145.\r\n\r\n5.\tIbid., p. 153.\r\n\r\n6.\tQuoted in Max Kaltenmark, Lao Tzu and Taoism (Stanford, Calif.:\r\nStanford University Press, 1969), p. 20.\r\n\r\n7.\tBurton Watson, Introduction to The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu (New\r\nYork: Columbia University Press, 1968), p. 7.\r\n\r\n8.\tArthur Waley, Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China (Garden City, N.\r\nY.: Doubleday, undated reprint of 1939 edition), p. 15.\r\n\r\n9.\tGai-fu Feng and Jane English, trans., Chuang Tsu (New York: Vintage\r\nBooks, 1974), p. 55.\r\n\r\n10.\tIbid. 309\r\n\r\n11.\tWm.

T. Suzuki, Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series\r\n(New York: Grove Press, 1961), p. 1 79. This is a translation of a\r\npassage from the Records of the Transmission of the Lamp compiled in\r\n1004 by Tao-yuan. A simpler version of the story can be found in the\r\noriginal source document, the Further Biographies of Eminent Priests\r\n(Hsu kao-seng chuan), prepared around the year 645 by Tao hsuan, and\r\ntranslated In Cat's Yawn, published by the First Zen Institute of\r\nAmerica, New York, 194 7. The story is repeated also in the Ch'uan fg-\r\npao chi, prepared ca, 700 10 by Tu Fei,\r\n\r\n2.\tThe fact that this episode does not appear in the earliest story of\r\nBodhidharma's life makes one skeptical about its authenticity. It is\r\nknown that Emperor Wu welcomed another famous Indian missionary,\r\nParamartha, who landed in Canton in 540 (Smith, Chinese Religions, p.\r\n120). This monk espoused the Idealistic school of Buddhism, which was\r\nat odds with the school of Ch'an. It seems possible that the story of\r\nBodhidharma's meeting was constructed to counter the prestige that Wu's\r\nInterest undoubtedly gave the Idealistic school.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Buddhist concept of Merit might be likened to a spiritual\r\nsavings account, Merit accrues on the record of one's good deeds and\r\nprovides several forms of reward in this world and the next, The Idea\r\nthat good deeds do not engender Merit seems to have been pioneered by\r\nTao-sheng (ca, 360 434), the Chinese originator of the idea of Sudden\r\nEnlightenment, \"Emptiness\" is, of course, the teaching of the Middle\r\nPath of Nagarjuna, The implication that Emperor Wu was startled by this\r\nconcept is worth a raised eyebrow, Sunyata or \"emptiness\" was hardly\r\nunknown In the Buddhist schools of the time.\r\n\r\nThis whole story is suspect, being first found In the Ch'uan fa-pao chi\r\nof Tu Fei (ca. 700 10), but not in the earlier biography, the Hsu kao-\r\nseng chuan (Further Biographies of Eminent Priests I, compiled by Tao-\r\nhsuan around 645, There is, incidentally, another competing story of a\r\nmonk named Bodhidharma in China, He was described as a Persian and was\r\nreported in Yang I Isuan-chih's Buddhist Monasteries In Loyang (Lo-yang\r\nCh'leh-lan-chi), written In 547, to have been associated with the Yung-\r\nning monastery, which would have been possible only between the years\r\n516 and 528. This Persian figure apparently claimed to be 150 years in\r\nage, and he most probably came to China via the trading port of Canton\r\nused by Persians. This fact has been used by some to cast doubt on the\r\nmore accepted story of a South Indian monk named Bodhidharma arriving\r\nat Canton between 520 and 525. Perhaps a legendary Persian was\r\ntransformed into a legendary Indian by the _Dhyana_ school, or perhaps\r\nit was a different individual.\r\n\r\n4.\tThis is the conclusion of the leading Zen scholar today, Philip\r\nYampolsky, in The Platform Sutra of The Sixth Patriarch (New York:\r\nColumbia University Press, 1967), p. 10.\r\n\r\n5.\tEnglish translations of various versions of this essay may be found\r\nIn Cat's Yawn by the First Zen Institute of America; In I).

Concerning this\r\nessay, Philip Yampolsky (private communication) has noted, \"Whereas a\r\nversion exists In The Transmission of the Lamp, various texts have been\r\nfound in the Tun-huang documents and elsewhere, so that a more complete\r\nversion is available.

Portions are as\r\nfollows: \"Said the Buddha: The two entrances are 'Entrance by Reason'\r\nand 'Entrance by Conduct,' 'Entrance by Reason' means to have a deep\r\nfaith in that all sentient beings are identical in essence with the\r\ntrue nature which is neither unity nor multiplicity; only it is\r\nbeclouded by external objects, The nature in itself neither departs nor\r\ncomes. When a man in singleness of thought abides in chueh-kuan, he\r\nwill clearly see into the Buddha-nature, of which we cannot say whether\r\nit exists or exists not, and in which there is neither selfhood nor\r\notherness. . . .\" Suzuki translates the term chueh-kuan as being\r\n\"awakened\" or \"enlightened,\"\r\n\r\n15.\tHu Shih, \"The Development of Zen Buddhism in China,\" Chinese Social\r\nand Political Science Review, 15,4 (January 1932), p. 483, Philip\r\nYampolsky (private communication) has questioned this generalization of\r\nHu Shih, noting, \"There were few practicing 'Zen' Buddhists, but other\r\nChinese Buddhists probably meditated seriously, although not\r\nexclusively.\"\r\n\r\n16.\tSuzuki, Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series, p, 186.\r\n\r\n17.\tSee Hu Shih, \"Development of Zen Buddhism in China,\" p. 482: \"But\r\nthe whole system of _dhyana_ practice, even in its concise form as\r\npresented in the translated manuals, was not fully understood by the\r\nChinese Buddhists. . . . The best proof of this is the following\r\nquotation from Hui-chiao, the scholarly historian of Buddhism and\r\nauthor of the first series of Buddhist Biographies which was finished\r\nin 519. In his general summary of the biographies of practitioners of\r\n_dhyana_, Hui-chiao said: 'But the apparent utility of _dhyana_ lies in\r\nthe attainment of magic powers. . .'.'\"\r\n\r\n18.\tSuzuki (Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series, p. 191), points out,\r\n\"Nagarjuna says in his famous commentary on the Prajnaparamita sutra,\r\n'Moral conduct is the skin, meditation is the flesh, the higher\r\nunderstanding is the bone, and the mind subtle and good is the marrow.'\r\n\" Since this commentary must have been common knowledge, the interest\r\nin Bodhidharma's alleged exchange with his disciples lies in his\r\nrecasting of a common coinage.\r\n\r\n19.\tFrom the Ch'uan fa-pao chi (ca. 700-10) of Tu Fei, as described by\r\nYampolsky, The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriach.

HUI-K'O: SECOND PATRIARCH OF ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tTranslated in Suzuki, Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series, p.190.\r\n\r\n2.\tHe is well documented in Tao-hsuan's Hsu kao-seng chuan or Further\r\nBiographies of Eminent Priests (A.D. 645). Selected portions of this\r\nbiography are related in Yampolsky, Platform Sutra of the Sixth\r\nPatriarch; and Suzuki, Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series, which form\r\nthe basis for much of the historical information reported here. Other\r\nuseful sources are Dumoulin, History of Zen Buddhism; and Chou Hsiang-\r\nkuang, _Dhyana_ Buddhism in China (Allahabad, India: Indo-Chinese\r\nLiterature Publications, 1960).\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Further Biographies of Eminent Priests by Tao-hsuan declares that\r\nbandits were responsible for severing his arm, but the 710 Chuan fa-pao\r\nchi of Tu Fei piously refutes this version, presumably since efforts\r\nwere starting to get underway to construct a Zen lineage, and dramatic\r\nepisodes of interaction were essential. This later work was also the\r\nfirst to report that Bodhidharma was poisoned and then later seen\r\nwalking back to India.\r\n\r\n4.\tAs reported by Dumoulin (History of Zen Buddhism, p. 73), this story,\r\nwhich is typical of later Ch'an teaching methods, first appears some\r\nfive hundred years after Bodhidharma's death, in the Ching-te ch'uan-\r\nteng-lu (1004).\r\n\r\n5.\tDumoulin, History of Zen Buddhism, p. 74.\r\n\r\n6.\tD.

SENG-TS'AN, TAO-HSIN, FA-JUNG, AND HUNG-JEN: FOUR EARLY MASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tAs usual, the biography can be traced in three sources. The earliest,\r\nthe Hsu kao-seng chuan of Tao-hsuan (645), apparently does not mention\r\nSeng-ts'an, or if it does so it gives him a different name. However, in\r\nthe Ch'uan fa-pao chi of Tu Fei (710) he receives a perfunctory\r\nbiography. The more embellished tale, giving exchanges and a copy of\r\nhis supposed poem, is to be found in the later work, the Ching-te\r\nch'uan-teng-lu (1004).\r\n\r\nDumoulin (History of Zen Buddhism) provides a discussion of the\r\nearliest historical notices of Seng-ts'an. The 710 version of the\r\nhistory is translated in Cat's Yawn (p. 14) and the 1004 version is\r\nrepeated in Suzuki, Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series.\r\n\r\n2.\tSuzuki, who recounts this last story in Essays in Zen Buddhism, First\r\nSeries (p. 195), points out identical insights in the third chapter of\r\nthe Vimalakirti Sutra.\r\n\r\n3.\tReportedly Hui-k'o also transmitted his copy of the Lankavatara to\r\nSeng-ts'an, declaring that after only four more generations the sutra\r\nwould cease to have any significance (Yampolsky, Platform Sutra of the\r\nSixth Patriarch, p. 11). As things turned out, this was more or less\r\nwhat happened, as the Lankavatara was replaced in the Ch'an schools by\r\nthe more easily understood Diamond Sutra. The Lankavatara school was\r\ndestined to be short-lived and to provide nothing more than a sacred\r\nrelic for the dynamic Ch'an teachers who would follow.\r\n\r\n4.\tSuzuki points out (Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series, p. 196) that\r\nthe Chinese word _hsin _can mean mind, heart, soul, and spirit,\r\nbeingall or any at a given time. He provides a full translation of the\r\npoem, as does R. H.

Curiously, nowhere\r\nin this biography is there mention of her lionizing of the Ch'an master\r\nShen-hsiu, something that figures largely in all Ch'an histories.\r\n\r\n2.\tA biography of Shen-hsiu from Ch'an sources may be found in\r\nYampolsky, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch. Further details may\r\nbe found in Hu Shih, \"Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in China: Its History and\r\nMethod,\" Philosophy East and West, 3, 1 (April 1953), pp. 3-24. See\r\nalso Kenneth Ch'en, Buddhism in China (Princeton: Princeton University\r\nPress, 1964).\r\n\r\n3.\tSuzuki, Essays in Zen Buddhism, First Series, p. 214.\r\n\r\n4.\tTwo books that give something of the intellectual atmosphere of T'ang\r\nChina are biographies of its two leading poets: Arthur Waley, The\r\nPoetry and Career of Li Po (London: George Allen & Unwin, Ltd., 1950);\r\nand A. R. Davis, Tu Fu (New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1971).\r\n\r\n5.\tFor a detailed biography of Shen-hui, see Yampolsky, Platform Sutra\r\nof the Sixth Patriarch.\r\n\r\n6.\tThe scholar who brought the significance of Shen-hui to the attention\r\nof the world was Hu Shih, whose landmark English-language papers on Zen\r\nare \"Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in China: Its History and Method\" and \"The\r\nDevelopment of Zen Buddhism in China.\" These works draw upon the\r\nmanuscripts discovered this century in the Tun-huang caves in the\r\nmountains of far northwest China. These manuscripts clarified many of\r\nthe mysteries surrounding the early history of Ch'an, enabling scholars\r\nfor the first time to distinguish between real and manufactured\r\nhistory--since some of the works were written before Ch'an historians\r\nbegan to embroider upon the known facts. A brief but useful account of\r\nthe finding of these caves and the subsequent removal of many of the\r\nmanuscripts to the British Museum in London and the Bibliotheque\r\nNationale in Paris may be found in Cat's Yawn. The best discussion of\r\nthe significance of these finds and of Hu Shih's lifelong interpretive\r\nwork is provided by Yampolsky, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch.\r\n\r\nRegarding the circumstances of this sermon, Walter Liebenthal (\"The\r\nSermon of Shen-hui,\" Asia Major, N.S. 3, 2 [1952], p. 134) says, \"There\r\nare only two opportunities to deliver addresses in the ritual of\r\nBuddhist monasteries, one during the uposatha ceremony held monthly\r\nwhen the pratimoksa rules are read to the members of the community and\r\nthey are admonished to confess their sins, one during the initiation\r\nceremony held once or twice a year. For the purpose of initiation\r\nspecial platforms are raised, one for monks and one for nuns, inside\r\nthe compounds of some especially selected monasteries.\"\r\n\r\n7.\tQuoted in Hilda Hookham, A Short History of China (New York: St.\r\nMartin's Press, Inc., 1972; paperback edition, New York: New American\r\nLibrary, 1972), p. 175.\r\n\r\n8.\tDiscussions of the adventures of An Lu-shan may be found in most\r\ngeneral surveys of Chinese history, including Hookham, Short History of\r\nChina, Wolfram Eberhard, A History of China (Berkeley: University of\r\nCalifornia Press, 1960); Kenneth Scott Latourette, The Chinese: Their\r\nHistory and Culture (New York: Macmillan, 1962); John A.

HUI-NENG: THE SIXTH PATRIARCH AND FATHER OF MODERN ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tA number of English translations of the Platform Sutra are in\r\nexistence. Among the most authoritative must certainly be counted\r\nYampolsky, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch; and Wing-tsit Chan,\r\nThe Platform Scripture (New York: St. John's University Press, 1963). A\r\nwidely circulated translation is in A. F. Price and Wong Mou-Lam, The\r\nDiamond Sutra and the Sutra of Hui-Neng (Berkeley, Calif.: Shambhala,\r\n1969). Another well-known version is found in Charles Luk, Ch'an and\r\nZen Teaching: Third Series (New York: Samuel Weiser, Inc., 1971). Two\r\nlesser-known translations are Paul F. Fung and George D. Fung, The\r\nSutra of the Sixth Patriarch on the Pristine Orthodox Dharma (San\r\nFrancisco: Buddha's Universal Church, 1964); and Hsuan Hua, The Sixth\r\nPatriarch's Dharma Jewel Platform Sutra (San Francisco: Buddhist Text\r\nTranslation Society, 1971).\r\n\r\n2.\tFrom the Diamond Sutra, contained in Dwight Goddard, ed., A Buddhist\r\nBible (Boston: Beacon Press, 1970), p. 102. Another version may be\r\nfound in Price and Wong, Diamond Sutra and the Sutra of Hui-neng. An\r\nextended commentary may be found in Charles Luk,\r\n\r\nCh'an and Zen Teaching, First Series, pp. 149-208. Later Ch'anists have\r\nmaintained that Hung-jen taught both the Diamond Sutra and the\r\nLankavatara Sutra, the respective scriptures of what came to be called\r\nSouthern and Northern schools of Ch'an. However, most scholars today\r\nbelieve that his major emphasis was on the Lankavatara Sutra, not the\r\nDiamond Sutra as the legend of Hui-neng would have.\r\n\r\n3.\tFrom Price and Wong, Diamond Sutra and the Sutra of Hui-neng, p. 15.\r\n\r\n4.\tIbid., p. 18.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe earliest version of the Platform Sutra is that found in the Tun-\r\nhuang caves and translated by Yampolsky and Chan. This manuscript\r\nYampolsky dates from the middle of the ninth century. A much later\r\nversion, dated 1153, was found in a temple in Kyoto, Japan, in 1934.\r\nThis is said to be a copy of a version dating from 967. The standard\r\nversion up until this century was a much longer work which dates from\r\n1291. As a general rule of thumb with the early Ch'an writings, the\r\nshorter the work, the better the chance it is early and authentic. For\r\nthis reason, the shorter Tun-huang works are now believed to be the\r\nmost authoritative and best account of the thoughts of the Sixth\r\nPatriarch.\r\n\r\n6.\tYampolsky, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, p. 69.\r\n\r\n7.\tThe most obvious problem with attribution of the Platform Sutra to\r\nHui-neng is that many of the sections of the sermon appear almost\r\nverbatim in The Sermon of Shen-hui, indicating that either one was a\r\ncopy of the other or they had a common source (which could have been\r\nthe simple setting down of a verbal tradition). It has been pointed out\r\nthat Shen-hui, who praises Hui-neng to the skies in his sermon, never\r\nclaims to be quoting the master. Instead, he pronounces as his own a\r\nnumber of passages that one day would be found in the work attributed\r\nto Hui-neng. The scholar Hu Shih has drawn the most obvious conclusion\r\nand has declared that Shen-hui and his school more or less created the\r\nlegend of Hui-neng--lock, stock, and sutra. Others refuse to go this\r\nfar, preferring instead to conclude that Shen-hui and Hui-neng are\r\nmerely two representatives of the same school.\r\n\r\n8.\tYampolsky, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, p. 157.\r\n\r\n9.\tYampolsky, Ibid., p. 140\r\n\r\n10.\tWu, Golden Age of Zen, p. 82.\r\n\r\n11.\tSee especially \"Intimations of Immortality\":\r\n\r\nOur birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The Soul that rises with us,\r\nour life's Star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, and cometh from afar:\r\nNot in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing\r\nclouds of glory do we come . . .\r\n\r\n12.\tYampolsky, Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, pp. 141-42.\r\n\r\n13.\tIbid., p. 117.\r\n\r\n14.\tFrom ibid., pp. 138-39.

The reliability of this text should be questioned,\r\nhowever, if we accept Philip Yampolsky's essay in Platform Sutra of the\r\nSixth Patriarch, p. 53: \"Huai-jang (677-744) . . . is known as a\r\ndisciple of Hui-neng. Information about him is based on sources\r\ncomposed much later than his death; no mention is made of him in any\r\neighth-century work. . . .\"\r\n\r\n6.\tJeffrey Broughton (\"Kuei-feng Tsung-mi,\" p. 27) points out that Ma-\r\ntsu's master's technique for achieving \"no-mind\" was to chant a phrase\r\nuntil running out of breath, at which time the activities of the mind\r\nwould seem to terminate--a reaction the more skeptical might call\r\nphysiological. Breath control and breath exercises, it will be\r\nrecalled, have always figured largely in Indian meditative practices.\r\n\r\n7.\tChang Chung-yuan, Original Teachings of Ch'an Buddhism, p. 148.

Charles Luk (Transmission of the Mind\r\nOutside the Teaching, p. 50) says: \"Huai-hai, the Dharma-successor of\r\nMa Tsu, was also called Pai Chang [Po Ch'ang] after the mountain where\r\nhe stayed at Hung Chou (now Nanchang, capital of Kiangsi province). Pai\r\nChang means: Pai, one hundred, and Chang, a measure of ten feet, i.e.,\r\nOne-thousand-foot mountain.\" However, Luk identifies the birthplace of\r\nHuai-hai as Chang Lo in modern Fukien province, as does Chou Hsiang-\r\nkuang in _Dhyana_ Buddhism in China.\r\n\r\n2.\tThis story is repeated in various places, including Wu, Golden Age of\r\nZen; and Blofeld, Zen Teaching of Hui Hai on Sudden Illumination.

Ch'en, (The Chinese Transformation of Buddhism\r\n[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973], p. 95) says, \"Besides\r\nthe Vinaya controlling the conduct of the Buddhist clergy, the basic\r\ncode governing Buddhist and Taoist monks and nuns during the T'ang\r\nDynasty was the Tao-seng-ke (Rules concerning Buddhist and Taoist\r\nclergy), formulated during the Chen-kuan era, probably 637. This Tao-\r\nseng-ke is no longer extant, however, but the Japanese work Soni-ryo,\r\nwhich governs the conduct of the community of monks and nuns in Japan,\r\nwas based on it. Therefore a study of the Soni-ryo would give us a good\r\nidea of the contents of the Tao-seng-ke. . . . [Certain] provisions of\r\nthe T'ang codes superseded the monastic code and called for penalties\r\nfor offenses which went beyond those specified in the Soni-ryo or the\r\nBuddhist Vinaya.\"\r\n\r\n7.\tFor a scholarly discussion of the economic role of Buddhism in T'ang\r\nChina, see D. C. Twitchett, \"Monastic Estates in T'ang China,\" Asia\r\nMajor, (1955-56), pp. 123-46. He explains that the T'ang government was\r\nalways a trifle uneasy about the presence of un-taxed monastic\r\nestablishments, and not without reason. Buddhism in T'ang China was big\r\nbusiness. The large monasteries were beneficiaries of gifts and\r\nbequests from the aristocracy, as well as from the palace itself.\r\n(Eunuchs, along with palace ladies, were particularly generous.) Laymen\r\noften would bequeath their lands to a monastery, sometimes including in\r\nthe will a curse on anyone who might later wish to take the land away\r\nfrom the church. These gifts were thought to ensure better fortunes in\r\nthe world to come, while simultaneously resolving tax difficulties for\r\nthe donor. For the monasteries themselves this wealth could only\r\naccumulate, since it never had to be divided among sons. After An Lu-\r\nshan's rebellion, a flavor of feudalism had penetrated Chinese society,\r\nand huge tracts came to be held by the Buddhist monasteries, to which\r\nentire estates were sometimes donated. As a result, the Buddhists had\r\nenormous economic power, although we may suspect the iconoclastic\r\n_dhyana_ establishments in the south enjoyed little of it.\r\n\r\n8.\tSee Dumoulin, History of Zen Buddhism, pp. 102-03.\r\n\r\n9.\tSee Heinrich Dumoulin and Ruth Fuller Sasaki, The Development of\r\nChinese Zen (New York: First Zen Institute of America, 1953), p.13.\r\nInterestingly, the Vinaya sect, founded by Tao-hsuan (596-667), was\r\nprimarily concerned with the laws of monastic discipline. The\r\nfamiliarity of Ch'an teachers with the concerns of this sect may have\r\ncontributed to the desire to create rules for their own assemblies.\r\n\r\n10.\tWu, Golden Age of Zen, p. 109.\r\n\r\n11.\tSee D.

This concept of the Zen layman has longbeen a part\r\nof Zen practice in Japan, and for this reason both Layman P'ang and the\r\npoet Han-shan are favorite Ch'an figures with the Japanese.

The translators explain the last two verses as\r\nfollows: \"This is derived from the old Chinese proverb: 'To win by a\r\nfluke is to fall into a fluke' (and thus to lose by a fluke).\"\r\nConcerning the meaning of this exchange, it would seem that water is\r\nhere being used as a metaphor for the undifferentiated Void, which\r\nsubsumes the temporary individuality of its parts the way the sea is\r\nundifferentiated, yet contains waves. When Tan-hsia accepts this\r\npremise a little too automatically, P'ang is forced to show him (via a\r\nsplash) that water (and by extension, physical manifestations of the\r\ncomponents of the Void) can also assume a physical reality that\r\nimpinges on daily life. Tan-hsia tries feebly to respond by returning\r\nthe splash, but he clearly lost the exchange.\r\n\r\n16.  Ibid. p. 73.\r\n\r\n17.

HUANG-PO: MASTER OF THE UNIVERSAL MIND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tChang Chung-yuan, Original Teachings of Ch'an Buddhism, p. 102.\r\n\r\n2.\tThis probably was during the last decade of the eighth century, since\r\nMa-tsu died in 788.\r\n\r\n3.\tThis volume actually consists of two books, known as the Chun-chou\r\nRecord (843) and the Wan-iing Record (849). They are translated and\r\npublished together by John Blofeld as The Zen Teaching of Huang Po.\r\n(New York: Grove Press, 1958).

Another translation of\r\nbiographical, didactic, and anecdotal material may be found in Charles\r\nLuk, Transmission of the Mind Outside the Teaching, whose source is\r\nunattributed but which possibly could be a translation of the 1602 work\r\nRecords of Pointing at The Moon, a compilation of Ch'an materials.\r\n\r\n4.\tBlofeld, Zen Teaching of Huang Po, p. 28.\r\n\r\n5.\tIbid., p. 27.\r\n\r\n6.\tChang Chung-yuan, Original Teachings of Ch'an Buddhism, p. 103.\r\n\r\n7.\tIbid.\r\n\r\n8.\tIbid., p. 90.\r\n\r\n9.\tIbid., p. 103.\r\n\r\n10.\tBlofeld, Zen Teaching of Huang Po, p. 99.\r\n\r\n11.\tThis gesture of defeat is reported elsewhere to have been a triple\r\nprostration.

It seems that he is reported to have died in 849 in\r\nRecords of Buddhas and Patriarchs in Various Dynasties, whereas the\r\nyear of his death is given as 855 in the General Records of Buddhas and\r\nPatriarchs.\r\n\r\n32.\tExcerpts from the Han Yu treatise are provided in Edwin O.\r\nReischauer, Ennin's Travels in T'ang China (New York: Ronald Press,\r\n1955), pp. 221 ff. This recounting of a visit by a ninth-century\r\nJapanese monk to China reveals indirectly how lacking in influence the\r\nCh'anists actually were. In a diary of many years Ch'an is mentioned\r\nonly rarely, and then in tones of other than respect. He viewed the\r\nCh'anists warily and described them as \"extremely unruly men at heart\"\r\n(p. 173). However, his trip in China was severely disturbed by the\r\nsudden eruption of the Great Persecution, making him so fearful that he\r\nactually destroyed the Buddhist art he had collected throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n33.\tSee Hu Shih, \"Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in China.\"\r\n\r\n34.\tSee Ibid.\r\n\r\n35.\tKenneth Ch'en, in \"The Economic Background of the Hui-Ch'ang\r\nSuppression of Buddhism,\" Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 19\r\n(1956), points out that the imperial decree required the turning in\r\nonly of statues made from metals having economic value. Those made from\r\nclay, wood, and stone could remain in the temples. He uses this to\r\nsupport his contention that the main driving force behind the Great\r\nPersecution was the inordinate economic power of the Buddhist\r\nestablishments.\r\n36.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.

TUNG-SHAN AND TSAO-SHAN: FOUNDERS OF SOTO ZEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tPhilip Yampolsky, in Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, alleges\r\nthat Hsing-ssu was resurrected from anonymity because Shih-t'ou (700-\r\n90) was in need of a connection to the Sixth Patriarch. The mysterious\r\nmaster Hsing-ssu comes into prominence well over a hundred years after\r\nhis death; his actual life was not chronicled by any of his\r\ncontemporaries. Neither, for that matter, was the life of his pupil\r\nShih-t'ou, although the latter left a heritage of disciples and a\r\nburgeoning movement to perpetuate his memory.\r\n\r\n2.\tIbid., p. 55.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe stories attached to Shih-t'ou are varied and questioned by most\r\nauthorities.

EISAI: THE FIRST JAPANESE MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tThis anecdote is in Martin Charles Collcutt, \"The Zen Monastic\r\nInstitution in Medieval Japan\" (Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University,\r\n1975).\r\n\r\n2.\tAlthough there were various attempts to introduce Ch'an into Japan\r\nprior to the twelfth century, nothing ever seemed to stick. Dumoulin\r\n(History of Zen Buddhism, pp. 138-39) summarized these efforts as\r\nfollows: \"The first certain information we possess regarding Zen in\r\nJapan goes back to the early period of her history. The outstanding\r\nJapanese Buddhist monk during that age, Dosho, was attracted to Zen\r\nthrough the influence of his Chinese teacher, Hsuan-tsang, under whom\r\nhe studied the Yogacara philosophy (653). . . . Dosho thus came into\r\nimmediate contact with the tradition of Bodhidharma and brought the Zen\r\nof the patriarchs to Japan. He built the first meditation hall, at a\r\ntemple in Nara. . . .\r\n\r\n\"A century later, for the first time in history, a Chinese Zen master\r\ncame to Japan. This was Tao-hsuan, who belonged to the northern sect of\r\nChinese Zen in the third generation after Shen-hsiu. Responding to an\r\ninvitation from Japanese Buddhist monks, he took up residence in Nara\r\nand contributed to the growth of Japanese culture during the Tempyo\r\nperiod (729-749). . . . The contemplative element in the Tendai\r\ntradition, which held an important place from the beginning, was\r\nstrengthened in both China and Japan by repeated contacts with Zen.\r\n\r\n\"A further step in the spread of Zen occurred in the following century\r\nwhen I-k'ung, a Chinese master of the Lin-chi sect, visited Japan. He\r\ncame at the invitation of the Empress Tachibana Kachiko, wife of the\r\nEmperor Saga, during the early part of the Showa era (834-848), to\r\nteach Zen, first at the imperial court and later at the Danrinji temple\r\nin Kyoto, which the empress had built for him. However, these first\r\nefforts in the systematic propagation of Zen according to the Chinese\r\npattern did not meet with lasting success. I-k'ung was unable to launch\r\na vigorous movement. Disappointed, he returned to China, and for three\r\ncenturies Zen was inactive in Japan.\"\r\n\r\nAnother opportunity for the Japanese to learn about Ch'an was missed by\r\nthe famous Japanese pilgrim Ennin, who was in China to witness the\r\nGreat Persecution of 845, but who paid almost no attention to Ch'an,\r\nwhich he regarded as the obsession of unruly ne'er-do-wells.\r\n\r\n3.\tA number of books provide information concerning early Japanese\r\nhistory and the circumstances surrounding the introduction of Buddhism\r\nto Japan. General historical works of particular relevance include:\r\nJohn Whitney Hall, Japan, from Prehistory to Modern Times (New York:\r\nDelacorte, 1970); Mikiso Hane, Japan, A Historical Survey (New York:\r\nScribner's, 1972); Edwin O. Reischauer, Japan: Past and Present, 3rd\r\ned. (New York: Knopf, 1964); and George B. Sansom, A History of Japan,\r\n3 vols. (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1958-63).\r\n\r\nStudies of early Japanese Buddhism may be found in: Masaharu Anesaki,\r\nHistory of Japanese Religion (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner,\r\n1930: reissue, Rutland, Vt.: Tuttle, 1963); William K.

Dale Saunders, Buddhism in\r\nJapan (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1964).\r\n\r\n4.\tIn fact, the popularity of esoteric rituals was such that they were\r\nan important part of early Zen practice in Japan.\r\n\r\n5.\tThis world is well described by Ivan Morris in The World of the\r\nShining Prince: Court Life in Ancient Japan (New York: Knopf, 1964). A\r\ndiscussion of the relation of this aesthetic life to the formation of\r\nJapanese Zen may be found in Thomas Hoover, Zen Culture (New York:\r\nRandom House, 1977; paperback edition, New York: Vintage, 1978).\r\n\r\n6.\tOne of the most readable accounts of the rise of the Japanese\r\nmilitary class may be found in Paul Varley, Samurai (New York:\r\nDelacorte, 1970; paperback edition, New York: Dell, 1972).\r\n\r\n7.\tThis theory is advanced eloquently in Collcutt, \"Zen Monastic\r\nInstitution in Medieval Japan.\" In later years the Ch'an sect in China\r\nitself actually entered a phase of decadence, with the inclusion of\r\nesoteric rites and an ecumenical movement that advocated the chanting\r\nof the nembutsu by Ch'anists--some of whom claimed there was great\r\nsimilarity between the psychological aspects of this mechanical chant\r\nand those of the koan.\r\n\r\n8.\tAccounts of Eisai's life may be found in Dumoulin, History of Zen\r\nBuddhism; and in Collcutt, \"Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval\r\nJapan.\"\r\n\r\n9.\tSee Collcutt, \"Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan.\"\r\n\r\n10.\tSee Saunders, Buddhism in Japan, p. 221.\r\n\r\n11.\tTranslated in Wm.

A Buddhist should not do so. If man detests\r\nwoman as the sexual object, she must detest him for the same reason.\r\nBoth man and woman become objects, thus being equally involved in\r\ndefilement. . . . What charge is there against woman? What virtue is\r\nthere in man? There are wicked men in the world; there are virtuous\r\nwomen in the world. The desire to hear Dharma and the search for\r\nenlightenment do not necessarily rely on the difference in sex.\"\r\n\r\n15.\tYokoi, Zen Master Dogen, pp. 35-36.\r\n\r\n16.\tSee Collcutt, \"Zen Monastic Training in Medieval Japan,\" p. 59.\r\n\r\n17.\tTranslated in de Bary, Sources of Japanese Tradition, Vol. 1., p.\r\n247.\r\n\r\n18.\tSee Collcutt, \"Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan,\" p. 62.\r\n\r\n19.\tSee Ibid., pp. 62 ff.\r\n\r\n20.See Philip Yampolsky, trans., The Zen Master Hakuin: Selected\r\nWritings, (New York: Columbia University Press, 1971), p. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.\tIKKYU: ZEN ECCENTRIC\r\n20.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tThis view is advanced convincingly by Collcutt in \"Zen Monastic\r\nInstitution in Medieval Japan,\" p. 113 ff.\r\n\r\n2.\tIbid., p. 80.\r\n\r\n3.\tThis would seem to be one of the reasons for what became of a host of\r\nemigrating Ch'an teachers as sub-sects of the Yogi branch struggled for\r\nascendency over each other.\r\n\r\n4.\tWu-an's strength of mind is illustrated by a story related in\r\nCollcutt, \"Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan,\" p. 84: \"Wu-an\r\nis said to have shocked the religious sensibilities of many warriors\r\nand monks when, in what has been interpreted as a deliberate attempt to\r\nsever the connection between Zen and prayer in Japanese minds, he\r\npublicly refused to worship before the statue of Jizo in the Buddha\r\nHill of Kencho-ji on the grounds that whereas Jizo was merely a\r\nBodhisattva, he, Wu-an, was a Buddha.\"\r\n\r\n5.\tRelated in Ibid., p. 88.\r\n\r\n6.\tCollcutt (\"Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan,\" p. 114)\r\npoints out that the warrior interest in Zen and its Chinese cultural\r\ntrappings should also be credited partly to their desire to stand up to\r\nthe snobbery of the Kyoto aristocracy. By making themselves emissaries\r\nof a prestigious foreign civilization, the warrior class achieved a bit\r\nof cultural one-upmanship on the Kyoto snob set.\r\n\r\n7.\tCollcutt (\"Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan,\" p. 106)\r\nreports that this conversion of temples to Zen was not always\r\nspontaneous. There is the story of one local governor who was called to\r\nKamakura and in the course of a public assembly asked pointedly whether\r\nhis family had yet built a Zen monastery in their home province. The\r\nterrified official declared he had built a monastery for a hundred Zen\r\nmonks, and then raced home to start construction.\r\n\r\n8.\tA discussion of the contribution of Zen to Japanese civilization may\r\nbe found in Hoover, Zen Culture. An older survey is D. T. Suzuki, Zen\r\nand Japanese Culture (Princeton, N.

The most exhaustive study and translation of original Ikkyu\r\nwritings to date is certainly that of James Sanford, \"Zen-Man Ikkyu\"\r\n(Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 1972).

An example of a Nasrudin-esque\r\nparable told about Ikkyu is the story of his approaching the house of a\r\nrich man one day to beg for food wearing his torn robes and straw\r\nsandals. The man drove him away, but when he returned the following day\r\nin the luxurious robe of a Buddhist prelate, he was invited in for a\r\nbanquet. But when the food arrived Ikkyu removed his robe and offered\r\nthe food to it.\r\n\r\n14.\tSanford, \"Zen-Man Ikkyu,\" p. 48.\r\n\r\n15.\tIbid., p. 68.\r\n\r\n16.\tIbid. pp. 80-81.\r\n\r\n17.

This is undoubtedly the\r\ndefinitive work by and about Hakuin in English and has been used for\r\nall the quotations that follow. Another translation of some of Hakuin's\r\nworks is R. D. M. Shaw, The Embossed Teakettle (London: George Allen &\r\nUnwin, 1963). A short translation of Hakuin's writings may be found in\r\nCleary, Original Face. Perhaps the most incisive biographical and\r\ninterpretive material may be found, respectively, in Dumoulin, History\r\nof Zen Buddhism; and Isshu and Sasaki, Zen Dust.\r\n\r\n2.\tYampolsky, Zen Master Hakuin, p. 117.\r\n\r\n3.\tIbid., p. 18.\r\n\r\n4.\tIbid., pp. 118-19.\r\n\r\n5.\tIbid., p. 119.\r\n\r\n6.\tIbid., p. 121.\r\n\r\n7.\tIbid., pp. 31-32.\r\n\r\n8.\tIbid., p. 33.\r\n\r\n9.\tIbid., p. 49.\r\n\r\n10.\tIbid., p. 33.\r\n\r\n11.\tIbid., pp. 52-53.\r\n\r\n12.\tIbid., p. 53.\r\n\r\n13.\tIbid., p. 58.\r\n\r\n14.\tIbid.\r\n\r\n15.\tIbid., p. 35.\r\n\r\n16.\tIbid., pp. 63-64.\r\n\r\n17.\tThe \"great ball of doubt,\" known in Chinese as i-t'uan, was a\r\nclassic Zen phrase and has been traced by Ruth Fuller Sasaki (Zen Dust,\r\np. 247) back to a tenth-century Chinese monk, who claimed in a poem,\r\n\"The ball of doubt within my heart/Was as big as a big wicker basket.\"\r\nHakuin's analysis of the \"great ball of doubt\" is translated in Zen\r\nDust, p. 43.\r\n\r\n18.\tHakuin's invention of his own koans, which were kept secret and\r\nnever published, is a significant departure from the usual technique of\r\nsimply taking situations from the classic literature, and demonstrates\r\nboth his creativity and his intellectual independence. It also raises\r\nthe question of whether they really were \"koans\" under the traditional\r\ndefinition of \"public case\" or whether they should be given a different\r\nname.\r\n\r\n19.\tYampolsky, Zen Master Hakuin, p. 164.\r\n\r\n20.\tThe koan system of Hakuin is discussed by Yampolsky in Zen Master\r\nHakuin, p. 15; and by Sasaki, in The Zen Koan, pp. 27-30.\r\n\r\n21.\tYampolsky, Zen Master Hakuin, p. 32.\r\n\r\n22.\tSee D.
