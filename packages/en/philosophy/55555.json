This term did not, however, originally\r\nclassify those who used a bloodless diet, but is derived from the\r\nLatin Homo Vegitus, which words described to the Romans a strong,\r\nvigorous man. The definition of the word Vegitus, as given in\r\nThomas Holyoke's Latin Dictionary, is \"whole, sound, quick, fresh,\r\nlively, lusty, gallant, trim, brave,\" and of Vegito, \"to refresh,\r\nto re-create.\" Professor Mayor of England adds to these definitions:\r\n\"The word vegetarian belongs to an illustrious family; vegetable,\r\nwhich has been called its mother, is really its niece.\"\r\n\r\nThe word has unfortunately become intermingled with various dietetic\r\ntheories, but the Vegetarian who is one because his conscience\r\nfor one reason or another condemns the eating of flesh, occupies a\r\nvery different place in the world of ethics from one who is simply\r\nrefraining from meat eating in an effort to cure bodily ills.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the dyspeptic frequenting the usual Vegetarian restaurant\r\nhas little opportunity to know much about vegetables as food,\r\nthe menu being, as a rule, so crowded with various mixtures which\r\nare supposedly \"meat substitutes\" that vegetables pure and simple\r\nfind small place. This book contains no meat substitutes, as such,\r\nbut receipts for the palatable preparation of what is called by many\r\n\"live foods,\"--that is, food which has no blood to shed and does not,\r\ntherefore, become dead before it can be eaten.\r\n\r\nThere will also be found lacking from the index such dishes as\r\n\"Vegetarian Hamburg Steak,\" \"Pigeon Pie, Vegetarian style,\" etc.,\r\nwhich should repel rather than attract, by bringing to mind what\r\nBernard Shaw has graphically spoken of as \"scorched carcasses.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been proven by myself and my household that flesh eating may\r\nbe safely stopped in one day with no injury to health or strength,\r\nand that a table supplied from the receipts in this book can make\r\nthose whom it furnishes with food well and strong as far as food can\r\nmake them so.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why thoughtful, cleanly, humane people should\r\nnot feed upon animals, but there is a surprising deafness to this\r\nfact shown by the majority of those active in humane charities. One\r\nmarvels to see hundreds of consecrated workers in session, putting\r\nforth every effort for the enacting of laws for the amelioration of the\r\nsufferings of cattle travelling to slaughter by car and ship, who are\r\nstill content to patronise the butcher shop to buy food supplied by\r\nthe dead bodies of these tortured victims of a false appetite. Mere\r\nthoughtlessness can make the kindest act cruelly inconsistent, for\r\nI once saw a woman presiding at a meeting held to discountenance the\r\nwearing of aigrettes with a sheaf of them decorating her bonnet. This\r\nlooks much like receiving stolen goods while denouncing theft.\r\n\r\nIt is well to write, and legislate, and pray for better and kinder\r\ntreatment of these frightened, thirst-maddened, tortured creatures\r\non their journey to our tables, but the surest, quickest way to help\r\n(and this can be done even while continuing to work for the alleviation\r\nof their sufferings) is to stop feeding upon them.\r\n\r\nIn a recent issue of a paper devoted to humane matters there is an\r\nindignant protest against the sufferings endured by crated chickens\r\nin a certain market, and another article deplores the cruelty shown\r\nto turtles in the same place, but when we know the writers of these\r\nprotests to be still willing to use these creatures on their tables,\r\nit is not always easy to fully credit their tender-heartedness. In\r\nanother such paper there appear from year to year sentimental pictures\r\nand poems extolling the kindliness and virtues of \"the cattle upon\r\na thousand hills,\" while those same pages print instructions on the\r\nmost humane way of slaying them, giving as a reason for the sudden\r\nand painless death described that suffering \"poisons the meat.\"\r\n\r\nThe favourite phrase, \"our four-footed friends,\" seems rather an\r\nanachronism in the face of our acknowledged relations to them as eater\r\nand eaten, for the phrase indicates a mutual pact of friendship,\r\nwhich, however well sustained by them, is dishonoured by man; for\r\neven cannibals, we are told, sink no lower than to eat their foes.\r\n\r\nThe demand for butcher's meat may not seem materially lessened because\r\nI do not eat it, but it is lessened notwithstanding, and I rejoice to\r\nknow that in the past seven years my abstinence from flesh must have\r\nresulted in a little less slaughter, and I am glad to have reduced\r\nby even one drop the depth of that ocean of blood. I have heard the\r\nBiblical statement that man was to have dominion over all the earth\r\nquoted as a justification for the eating of the lower animals. We\r\nwill some day be so civilised that we will recognise the great truth\r\nthat dominion implies care, and guardianship, and protection rather\r\nthan the right to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe first objection voiced against Vegetarianism is not usually\r\nagainst its principle, but its practice; we are told that the refusal\r\nto eat meat causes inconvenience, and that it is best to \"eat what is\r\nset before you, asking no questions for conscience's sake.\" I could\r\nrespect the position of one who literally believed and consistently\r\nacted on this mandate, but where in Christendom can he be found? Few\r\nof us could or would eat the flesh of a pet lamb, or partake knowingly\r\nof horse flesh, or could or would feel called upon to dine on these\r\nlines with the peoples who eat dog, or with so-called cannibals. The\r\nhost might have secured, in a broad spirit of hospitality, just the\r\nparticular carcass which most pleased his own palate, but courtesy\r\nseldom forces us to eat any flesh other than the sorts to which our\r\nown habits have accustomed us.\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known story of an American statesman who was reared\r\nby Vegetarian parents in the country, and taken while still a small\r\nboy to dine at a neighbour's. During the progress of the meal a large\r\nplatter was borne into the room, on which lay something the like of\r\nwhich he had not seen on any table. He stared in wonder, and finally\r\nlocated the resemblance and shouted, \"Why, mother, if that isn't a\r\ndead hen!\" Habit had not overcome his horror of that particular dead\r\nthing as food, as it would have done had he seen dead hens served as\r\nfood all his life.\r\n\r\nAs to the inconvenience caused my friends when I am at their tables,\r\nI consider it of such small consequence compared to the fact that\r\neven one child should be standing almost knee-deep in blood in some\r\nslaughter-house, working to supply my wants, that it is not worth a\r\nsecond thought. No one need go hungry from any well-planned dinner,\r\neven though no extra preparation has been made for the non-meat-eating\r\nguest; but if my hostess knows in advance that I do not eat meat,\r\nand wishes to have prepared an especial dish, I give her the benefit\r\nof the doubt, and believe that she is as pleased to do it as I would\r\nbe in her place. We like to take a little extra trouble to entertain\r\nour friends, and the thought expended to give others pleasure is\r\nperhaps the real joy of hospitality.\r\n\r\nAnother class of objector likes to remind us that we take life when we\r\neat vegetables, or drink, or breathe. A friend, who has since ceased\r\nto consider the unnecessary and cruel slaughtering of thousands of\r\ncreatures daily a fit subject for joking, once sent me in raillery a\r\nsonnet which rehearsed the sad death suffered by a cabbage to satisfy\r\na Vegetarian's selfish cravings. I find no qualms in my own conscience\r\non this subject, but should I ever come to feel as these over-sensitive\r\nclaim I should, I hope I will not then eat even the \"innocent cabbage.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, if the germs in the water we drink and the air we breathe\r\ndo die by reason of our drinking and breathing I endure no\r\nself-condemnation. Man cannot be required to do the impossible by\r\nany Principle of Good, and to do each day what good he is able to do,\r\nto avoid the evil he can avoid, and in every difficulty choose what\r\nhe thinks to be the lesser of two evils, is perhaps as much as even\r\nDivine Love expects of him to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is well to face the unpleasant fact that there are occasions when\r\nin our present state of development it seems necessary to kill in\r\nself-defence, as it were, moths, rats, etc.; but even in this we can\r\n\"do our best,\" and it has been well said, \"angels can do no more.\" We\r\ncan by care in our households greatly reduce this necessity, and we\r\ncan always see that no creatures, although destroying our property,\r\npilfering or stealing, are in their death made to suffer. In this\r\nconnection I would urge every one who reads these lines to never\r\npermit a piece of sticky fly-paper to be brought into the house,\r\nfor of all cruel ways of destruction, this slow method, by which the\r\nunfortunate fly almost dismembers itself in its frantic efforts to\r\nescape, is one of the most fiendishly contrived.\r\n\r\nAn advocate of Vegetarianism has truly said, \"A vegetable diet is\r\nas little connected with weakness and cowardice as meat eating\r\nis with physical force and courage.\" That Vegetarians are not\r\nphysical weaklings is no mere matter of opinion, but is proven\r\nby the giant Japanese wrestlers; the ancient Greek wrestlers;\r\nthose Indian regiments of the British army showing most endurance;\r\nby the peasantry of the world, which is seldom able to afford meat,\r\nand above all, by those famous Vegetarians who march around the globe\r\ndoing the work carnivorous man is too weak to do,--the horse, the ox,\r\nthe camel, and the elephant. One of our best-known cooking teachers and\r\nfood experts printed this statement not long ago: \"While meat seems\r\nnecessary to the rapid development of the American, I must contend\r\nthat a well-selected vegetable diet will give greater health, bodily\r\nvigour, and mental strength,\" which would seem contradictory, for even\r\nan American would not seem to require other food than that which will\r\ngive him greatest health, bodily vigour, and mental strength.\r\n\r\nNor have we cause to feel ashamed of the mentality of the guests at\r\nCeres' table, which is graced by a goodly company; the list of names\r\nencircling the cover of \"The Vegetarian Magazine\" reads, \"Adam, Hesiod,\r\nGautama, Isaiah, Daniel, Plato, Zoroaster, Aristotle, Seneca, Ovid,\r\nPlutarch, Pope, Swedenborg, Leonardo da Vinci, Voltaire, Franklin,\r\nWestley, Linnæus, Shelley, Tolstoi, and King Oscar II.\" Others are\r\nBernard Shaw, and Maurice Maeterlinck (who is said to have become a\r\nnon-meat eater to gain greater endurance for his favourite pastime\r\nof mountain climbing), Richard Wagner, and General Booth.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the one great argument for a fleshless diet is the\r\nhumanitarian one, and it does not seem possible that persons exist\r\nto-day who do not know of the horrors of cruelty which take place\r\nhourly, in order that meat may be eaten by men and women who could\r\nnot look without sickening at the process which has made possible\r\nthe roast upon their tables, but who are nevertheless the employers\r\nof every fainting child in the stock-yards, and every brutalised man\r\nin the shambles, whose wages they pay with every pound of meat they\r\nbuy. The real butcher of an animal is the one for whom it receives\r\nits death blow, not the one who actually deals that blow.\r\n\r\nA man who recently visited some stock-yards writes: \"We were sorry to\r\nsee the Thor man make mislicks at a pretty heifer. His first stroke\r\ndid not fell her, and she staggered and looked at him so wonderingly\r\nand pathetically. He could not strike her while her head was in that\r\nposition, and after giving her two or three more ineffectual blows,\r\nshe looked at him so reproachfully, as if pleading, 'Why do you treat\r\nme so cruelly?  What have I ever done to you?' Finally he got her\r\ndown and out of her misery. I shall never take a bit of steak on my\r\nfork without seeing that pretty heifer lifting her stunned head to\r\nthat awkward pounder.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing more revolting than this same writer's remarks anent\r\npig-killing has been written, but since the words are accurately\r\ntrue, they should be fit to read, for if the words which tell the\r\ntruth about meat as food are unfit for our ears, the meat itself is\r\nnot fit for our mouths. He describes the pig-sticking, the skinning,\r\nand the process which makes the pig into pork, and then adds: \"He goes\r\ninto the cooling room, and the whole effort from that time is to keep\r\nhim from crumbling back into dust, attacked by worms. Salt and brine\r\nand smoke and cold prevent the corpse from utter dissolution. The\r\nrefrigerator is a sort of Purgatory where the brute stays until he\r\nfinally finds a cemetery in the human alimentary canal.\" Yet this\r\nman expects to again have meat \"on his fork\"!\r\n\r\nThe \"Cosmopolitan\" calls attention to the remarkable procession daily\r\npassing through a certain slaughter-house, as follows: \"Imagine a\r\nprocession of 10,000 cattle marching two by two, in a line fifteen\r\nmiles long; let 20,000 sheep follow them, bleating along twelve miles\r\nof road; after them drive sixteen miles of hogs, 27,000 strong; then\r\nlet 30,000 fowls bring up the rear, clucking and quacking and gobbling,\r\nover a space of six miles; and in this whole caravan, stretching for\r\nnearly fifty miles and requiring two days to pass a given point, you\r\nwill see the animals devoted to death in the packing houses of ----\r\n& Co. in a single day. Surely a Buddhist would think that the head\r\nof that establishment had much to answer for. Never before in the\r\nworld's history was a massacre of the innocents organised on such a\r\nstupendous scale or with such scientific system.\"\r\n\r\nPeople are surprisingly callous to the sufferings of those animals\r\ndestined to become food. Recently some well-dressed, well-mannered\r\nmen were on a train returning East from a Western visit, and the train\r\ncoming to a standstill for some reason, their conversation was plainly\r\noverheard by their fellow-passengers. They were discussing a visit\r\nto the stock-yards, and one of them, quite convulsed with laughter,\r\ncried out that he really thought the most comical sight he had seen\r\nwhile away, in fact one of the funniest things he had seen in his\r\nwhole life, was the antics of a pig \"which had escaped out of the\r\nscalding pen!\" The pig-sticker had evidently been as awkward that\r\ntime as the man who missed the pretty heifer.\r\n\r\nIt is daily less possible to buy turkeys and chickens minus their\r\nheads. The delicate death without the use of the old-time axe (which\r\nwe degraded men and women have thought a pretty symbol to place on\r\nThanksgiving Day table cards) is brought about by hanging the fowls\r\nup by the feet, in what fright can be imagined, an incision is then\r\nmade in the roof of the mouth, and after bleeding to death, which,\r\nas in the case of calves or veal, insures solid white flesh, they are\r\nserved as food to dainty women who can scarcely bear to kill a fly,\r\nand alas! to some members of the societies for the Prevention of\r\nCruelty to Animals!\r\n\r\nOne crate of chickens can encase more suffering than I want endured\r\nfor me. There is first the terror in capture, then the suffering of\r\nbeing thrust, legs often tied, in the small over-crowded crate, then\r\nthe journey in the shrieking train, and the thirst-tortured hours in\r\nthe sun before the final twist of the neck or the blow of the axe,\r\ngiven in many cases just before natural death would render the fowl\r\nunfit for sale. And such food, poisoned by fear and suffering, is\r\nconsidered the most delicate, and thought fit to feed to invalids!\r\n\r\nThat all chickens do not endure the same suffering before death is\r\nno excuse for eating them, for some will have to submit to it while\r\nchicken is an article of food. The modern invention of fattening fowl\r\nby the machine-stuffing method, to make what are called in England\r\n\"Surrey fowls,\" and in America are given various fancy names, is so\r\nrevolting that it almost makes one faint to read a true account of\r\nit. We are selfishly prone to comfort ourselves when these things are\r\nbrought to our notice with the thought that the lower creatures do not\r\nsuffer as we would. The fact is that no two live beings suffer the\r\nsame in any event, physical or mental, but the lower animal or bird\r\nor fish suffers in its fear and death all it is capable of suffering,\r\nand we have no right to make any creature do this for our pleasure.\r\n\r\nMr. E. Bell has written, \"Dreadful are the revelations made by humane\r\nmen, who, setting aside personal comfort and peace of mind, have\r\nendeavoured to sound the depths of animal agony and bloodshed. The\r\nprocess of flaying alive, and even of dismembering animals before\r\nthe breath has left their bodies, is far from uncommon in private\r\nslaughter-houses.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we witness the cruelty to horses on our streets, though they\r\nare property which the most unwise would naturally seek to care for,\r\nwe can only imagine what must chance to the unfortunate creatures,\r\nalready condemned to death and only regarded as food, at the hands\r\nof the hardened men whose miserable lot it is to be employed by\r\nChristendom to do its most evil work.\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet called \"An Epitome of Vegetarianism\" C. P. Newcombe\r\nwrites: \"Our opponents are quick to point out the supposed resemblance\r\nbetween the canine teeth of man and those of the carnivora, forgetting\r\nthat they are even more prominent in the ape, the horse, and the\r\ncamel. We accept the challenge and appeal for an authoritative\r\nstatement of the facts to the great masters of science, among whom\r\nthere is complete agreement, viz., that expressed by Baron Cuvier, the\r\nProfessor of Natural History in the College of France, who wrote in\r\n'The Animal Kingdom,' vol. i, page 88: 'Fruits, roots, and the other\r\nsucculent parts of vegetables appear to be the natural food of man;\r\nhis hands afford him a facility for gathering them, and his short and\r\ncomparatively weak jaws, his short canine teeth, not passing beyond the\r\ncommon line of others, and his tuberculous cheek teeth would not permit\r\nhim either to feed upon herbage or devour flesh unless these aliments\r\nwere previously prepared by the culinary process.' Similar opinions\r\nare expressed by Sir Charles Bell, F. R. S., Prof. William Lawrence,\r\nF. R. S., Sir Richard Owen, K. C. B., F. R. S., and Dr. Charles Darwin,\r\nwith many others.\"\r\n\r\nWhile interesting in stating a case, this interests me as an argument\r\nbut little, for if we were carnivorously made, with our minds,\r\nour hearts, our capacity for love and charity, and that great hope\r\nwe have of finally manifesting the perfection of the sons of God,\r\nwe still should control our tendencies by a higher law, and no more\r\nbe carnivorous than we are apes, or marauders, or any other mental\r\nor physical manifestation from which spiritual evolution has lifted\r\nus high.\r\n\r\nBut this humanitarianism does not consider alone the animals\r\nslaughtered, but the men, women, and children who do this revolting\r\nwork. One packing-house in the West advertises over 18,000 employees;\r\nmultiply this by thousands and one can estimate the numbers of human\r\nbeings who are thus degraded and brutalised. In my own household\r\nI have made it a point of honour to demand no labour which I would\r\nnot be willing to do myself; I might fail in strength, but morally I\r\nwould be willing to undertake any work required by me, and from the\r\nday I realised what I required from others if I ate meat, I became\r\nan abstainer from it, for no surer ethical truth can be stated than\r\nthat we have no moral right to demand from the hands of another,\r\nwork we would not be willing to undertake ourselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Salt has written, \"Of all recognised occupations, the\r\nwork which is looked upon with the greatest loathing (next to\r\nthe hangman's) is that of the butcher--the trade of doing to death\r\ncountless numbers of inoffensive and highly organised creatures, amid\r\nscenes of indescribable filth and ferocity--is delegated to a pariah\r\nclass of slaughter-men, who are thus themselves made the victims of\r\na grievous social wrong.\"\r\n\r\nSo large a percentage of the murderers of to-day have been butchers,\r\nthey or their fathers before them, that these statistics alone\r\nconstitute a sufficient argument for Vegetarianism.\r\n\r\nMan's inhumanity to himself in this matter of flesh eating is rapidly\r\nbeing uncovered by meat inspectors, food experts, and hundreds of\r\nphysicians the world over. The statistics comparing meat-eating\r\nand non-meat-eating races with regard to tuberculosis, cancer,\r\nappendicitis, etc., are of the greatest interest to those who care\r\nnot only for the health but for the mere cleanness of their bodies.\r\n\r\nDr. B. W. Richardson, in a book called \"The Field of Disease,\" says:\r\n\"In Jewish communities there are a number of men set apart to act\r\nas inspectors of animal food. They attend at the slaughter-houses,\r\nand after an animal is slain and dressed they submit it to inspection;\r\nthen, unless they put upon it their sign, that it is free from disease,\r\nit is not permitted to enter a Jewish family. It enters into the\r\nfamilies outside the Jewish community, so that we who are not Jews\r\nactually accept into our bodies food which the Jews have rejected\r\nas diseased.\"\r\n\r\nThe statistics taken from two small abattoirs alone, for one year, as\r\ngiven by a secretary of one Jewish ecclesiastical board are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Total oxen killed        22,308\r\n                  Diseased                  7,885\r\n                  Total calves killed       3,330\r\n                  Diseased                    705\r\n                  Total sheep killed       41,556\r\n                  Diseased                 13,019\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to this very nearly one-third of all the meat sold to\r\nChristian families is tainted by parasitical disease. If an animal\r\ndies of cancer, tuberculosis, etc., our laws protect us from the\r\ncarcass, but, if slaughtered, the diseased portion is cut away and\r\nthe remainder is sold as fit for food. Such blood is squeezed from\r\nbeef and poured by the gallon by loving hands into the willing lips\r\nof consumptives and anæmics!\r\n\r\nThe true Vegetarian will not be seen adorned (?) by any of the\r\nreapings from a dead body, whether they be feathers or furs, for\r\nthese have no beauty in the sight of those who see them in thought,\r\ndripping with the blood from which they can never be truly cleansed.\r\n\r\nThose who would \"strain at gnats\" while swallowing camels, criticise\r\nthe Vegetarian for his kid gloves and his leather shoes; but perfect\r\nconditions do not yet prevail for the absolutely consistent carrying\r\nout of his principles; his effort is to help to bring these to pass,\r\nand he does not refrain from beginning for the reason that he cannot\r\nyet do all. An adequate substitute for leather has been made which\r\nexperiments have proven of value, but, as yet, there is no demand\r\nwhich justifies its manufacture.\r\n\r\nMany express the fear that, were wholesale slaughter abolished, the\r\nearth would be overrun by the lower animals; but were artificial and\r\nunnatural breeding discontinued we can safely trust that the animal\r\ncreation would find its proper place in the world, as everything does,\r\nunder the guidance of the controlling Mind which is Creator.\r\n\r\nStop and think for a moment what the world would be like to-day if it\r\nwere Vegetarian. If the world were Vegetarian, the endless caravans of\r\ndoomed creatures would not be ambling to the shambles; not a man would\r\nbe brutalised by the daily slaughter of hundreds of gentle creatures;\r\nnot a woman would be engaged in sorting edible parts from the dissected\r\ncarcasses, making all red around her; not a child would be standing\r\ndeep in offal, seeking useful bits of dead bodies; \"where sympathy is,\r\ncruelty is impossible,\" therefore, not a dog would be maltreated, not a\r\ncat selfishly deserted to starve, not a horse cruelly beaten, and not\r\na vivisectionist could be found on the face of the earth! Those who\r\nhad learned to be just to the lower animals would not fail in their\r\nduties to man, and in this millennium, prophesied in Isaiah xi: 9,\r\nslaughter-houses, transport cars, and cattle-ships would be empty,\r\nand the fields and meadows would be filled with labourers under the\r\nclear sky, tilling the ground to provide the food of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. R. L. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvidence House, Chestnut Hill, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        I do not see how it is possible that so many good people\r\n        remain meat-eaters.\r\n\r\n                                                      Count Leo Tolstoi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no room in the house which requires such careful furnishing\r\nas the kitchen, and much time may be saved there if the right thing is\r\nin the right place, for just as truly as \"the means to do ill deeds\r\nmake ill deeds done,\" do the means to do things well tend toward\r\ntheir being done.\r\n\r\nTo house-builders I would urge that it pays to have a white enamelled\r\nsink, and to insist that no sand-soap or scouring soap be used\r\non it, as this removes the finish and makes it less easy to keep\r\nit spotless. See that a package of one of the cleaning powders is\r\nplaced near the sink, convenient for use the first time the maid\r\nlooks about for materials, and over the sink on small hooks have hung\r\ntwo or three different shaped sink brushes. An enamelled soap-dish\r\nshould be fastened above the sink, and on the left of it a grooved,\r\nslightly slanting draining board for washed dishes; hanging under\r\nthis on a large hook should be the enamelled dishpan and back of it\r\na wire drainer, both hanging free from the wall.\r\n\r\nAny kitchen can have a chair-rail put around it, and this four-inch\r\nwide board should be arranged with small hooks placed at a distance of\r\nten or twelve inches apart, and on these should hang the enamelled\r\nspoons, strainers, egg-beater, small jugs, and the saucepans,\r\nthe bottoms of these being always in evidence and not out of sight\r\nin cupboards. The Europeans have always had their cooking utensils\r\ndisplayed as a part of the kitchen furnishing, and when this is done\r\nthere is less temptation to neglect their absolute cleanliness.\r\n\r\nOne of the comforts of my kitchen is a holder for saucepan covers; I\r\nwas about to invent such a holder when I found that the wire ones made\r\nto display half a dozen handsome plates were perfectly suitable. One\r\nof these hangs beside the stove and the covers are conveniently at\r\nhand when required.\r\n\r\nA cupboard built in the kitchen, sixteen inches deep and six feet\r\nacross, will hold all the casseroles, baking-pans, tins for spices,\r\netc., which the usual family requires. Mine was built with this\r\nconviction, and if it becomes overcrowded, I know it has things in\r\nit which do not belong there, and a few moments given to overseeing\r\nits rearrangement always leave it with all the space required.\r\n\r\nThe table shown in the illustration is becoming well-known in American\r\nkitchens; the deep drawers for flour, etc., are a convenience not\r\neasy to estimate, but the fact that two sizes of pastry boards slide\r\nsnugly into their places under the top is its best feature.\r\n\r\nA ball of string in a holder hung up with small scissors attached,\r\na neat calendar, a washable tablet for orders, a burnt-match holder,\r\na match-box holder fastened near the stove, a small mirror on a door\r\nor in an inconspicuous corner, and a wall clock are things which I\r\nadvise the young housekeeper to see securely placed in her kitchen\r\nbefore the pictures are hung in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nA plate-rack is not only always quaint and decorative, but is\r\nmost useful and labour-saving. A pestle and mortar should be among\r\nthe utensils of every kitchen, as well as a vegetable mill, and a\r\nsmall hard-wood board, used exclusively for the cutting of fruit,\r\nvegetables, etc., which are to be sliced, saves many a cut finger,\r\nas the plate usually used is not the proper shape or texture for such\r\na slippery process.\r\n\r\nA piece of thick glass measuring about 7×9 inches, and bound about\r\nthe edges with heavy gummed paper or linen, is useful to lay upon the\r\nopen pages of the cook-book, and serves the double purpose of holding\r\nit open at the required page and of protecting it from floured or\r\nbuttered fingers.\r\n\r\nA plentiful supply of the small earthenware dishes, called casseroles,\r\nmarmites, ramekins, and gratin dishes, is especially useful in the\r\nVegetarian's kitchen.\r\n\r\nThose building homes should see that the place on which the stove is\r\nto stand is covered with suitable tiling, and this should extend for\r\ntwo feet or more around the stove. The floor itself is best covered\r\nwith linoleum, and if a colour scheme is carried out in this room,\r\nas it may well be in these days of many-coloured enamelled ware,\r\nit can be accented by the linoleum chosen and the kitchen thus made\r\nas beautiful for its purpose as any room in the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      I have not partaken of a fellow creature for fifteen years.\r\n\r\n                                                           Bernard Shaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DINING ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a breakfast room is not used, a small winged table set in a\r\nsunny corner, or bay-window recess of the dining room, and used as a\r\nbreakfast table, is an improvement upon breakfast at the large dining\r\ntable, and can be arranged in almost any dining room.\r\n\r\nIf pictures are hung in this room nothing less appropriate\r\nthan those usually chosen as fit subjects for its walls can be\r\nimagined. Engravings showing the gentle deer hunted to his death, with\r\nthe dog's fangs already buried in his flesh, stuffed heads of the same\r\nanimal, and paintings of dead fish, ducks or grouse, hanging by their\r\nfeet, should not give pleasure to or improve the appetites of humane\r\npeople. If pictures are used let us have those which depict life,\r\njoy, kindness, and beauty rather than cruelty, bloodshed, and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Among the noblest in the land,\r\n              Though he may count himself the least,\r\n            That man I honor and revere\r\n              Who without favor, without fear,\r\n            In the great city dares to stand\r\n              The friend of every friendless beast.\r\n\r\n                                    Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE COMMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONING\r\n\r\nThe subject of seasoning is indeed holy ground in culinary matters,\r\nand after much thought and experiment I have decided that the phrase\r\nso deplored by young housekeepers, \"season to taste,\" is after all not\r\nthe worst one to use. No such inaccurate directions were to appear\r\nin this cook-book when planned, but I have finally decided with the\r\narmy of wiser cooks who have preceded me that accurate measurements\r\nin seasoning are dangerous to success. Not only do tastes vary,\r\nbut much depends on the time the seasoning is added, on the rapidity\r\nwith which the food is cooking, etc. With this in mind, and very long\r\nprejudice against the old phrase above mentioned, I have compromised\r\nand frequently been tempted to state quantities of salt and pepper,\r\nusually regretting when I have. The truth is, unless one can \"season\r\nto taste\" one cannot cook palatable dishes, and my final word on the\r\nsubject is that it is well to always use a little more salt and pepper\r\nthan seems advisable, and then just before serving add a little more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURING\r\n\r\nWeights as a means of measuring quantities have been avoided in these\r\nrecipes, as I can see no advantage to the system which uses them,\r\nand I have been able to show even English cooks that the scales are\r\nnot the most necessary part of the kitchen furnishing, and they have\r\nbecome devoted to our simple method of using the kitchen cup as the\r\nstandard. It holds 1/2 pint, and 2 cups, therefore, hold 1 pint;\r\n4 cups hold 1 quart; and I find no fault with the old couplet,--\r\n\r\n\r\n                       \"A pint's a pound\r\n                        The world around.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt usually is, and one cannot go far wrong in acting as if it always\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICKENING\r\n\r\nIn thickening sauces and soups, ordinary flour can always be used\r\nand cornstarch also, and as a rule I have said \"flour\" only in these\r\nrecipes, but have only refrained from always advising potato-flour\r\nbecause it would have confused many who cannot obtain it in America. In\r\nGermany it is always used, and when it can be had is far nicer for\r\nthickening all vegetable sauces and soups than any other sort of flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN HERB GARDEN\r\n\r\nNo one thing pays better for the little trouble expended than a\r\nsmall herb garden. Buy two or three tarragon plants, cover them in\r\nthe winter, and in the autumn pick the leaves to make vinegar and to\r\ndry. Plant chervil, parsley, thyme, chives, and a plant of rosemary.\r\n\r\nA window-box will keep parsley and chives on hand, and a clump of\r\nchives from the market will grow for weeks if set in a bowl and\r\nwatered occasionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGELATINE\r\n\r\nInstead of the usual gelatine use must be made of arrowroot or a\r\ngelatine advertised to be purely vegetable. One tablespoon is usually\r\nallowed to 1 pint of liquid, but experiments must be made and there\r\nwill usually be directions found with the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAT FOR FRYING\r\n\r\nThe Vegetarian can well afford to do away with that doubtful economy,\r\ncooking butter. For ordinary frying use good butter; for deep fat\r\nuse a good brand of cooking-oil, or cocoanut butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED GOODS\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a habit with many people to decry the use of canned\r\nvegetables, although I believe there are few households which\r\nsubsist without them. My experience is that the best grades of canned\r\nvegetables are often far sweeter and better, fresher in fact, than\r\nvegetables that can be bought in city markets. The housekeeper should\r\nmake it a point to know which brands she prefers and to trade where she\r\ncan get them; and where no retailer carries them she can usually obtain\r\ncases containing two dozen each from the preservers themselves. A\r\nlittle trouble taken in the autumn to stock the store-room, instead\r\nof ordering \"a can of peas\" now and then at random, saves time and\r\ntrouble in the end. Among the canned vegetables which are put up and\r\nsealed the day they are picked by the best firms are beets, peas,\r\ncorn, spinach, hard-shelled beans, tomatoes, stringless beans, wax\r\nbeans, mushrooms, pimentos, okra, okra-tomato, asparagus, etc.; and\r\nthe saving of time and labour in the preparation of beans, spinach,\r\nand beets especially, is worth consideration. People make the mistake\r\nof merely warming up canned goods and then serving them, whereas when\r\nthe can is opened the vegetables are only ready to be seasoned and\r\nfinished as they would be had they been boiled at home. Good canned\r\nvegetables are not easy to improve upon, and I serve them constantly\r\nto people who will not easily credit my statement that they are not\r\nso-called \"fresh\" vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        I will not kill or hurt any living creature needlessly,\r\n        nor destroy any beautiful thing, but will strive to save\r\n        and comfort all gentle life and guard and perfect all\r\n        natural beauty upon the earth.\r\n\r\n                                                            John Ruskin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUPS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost clear soups can be greatly improved in colour by using a small\r\nquantity of vegetable soup browning, or caramel. Do not overdo it,\r\nhowever, as the flavour is not pleasant when too pronounced. All\r\ncream soups should be cooked in a double boiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE STOCK\r\n\r\nFew meat stocks have of themselves more flavour than vegetable stock,\r\nthat is, the water in which vegetables have cooked. The water in\r\nwhich rice, onions, leeks, celery, beans, cabbage, etc., have boiled\r\nis valuable in Vegetarian cookery, and the wise cook will use it in\r\nmany ways to enhance the flavours of soups and sauces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE CONSOMMÉ OR STOCK\r\n\r\nA simple way of preparing a rich, clear consommé is to wash well 1/2\r\ncup of German lentils, drain them and toss them for ten minutes in a\r\nsaucepan in which 1 tablespoon of butter has been melted. Then pour\r\non them 5 cups of cold water, set them over a hot fire, and let them\r\nboil rapidly about half an hour only. Drain, and strain through a\r\nfine cloth, and return to a clean saucepan with 1 bay leaf, 1 slice\r\nof onion, 2 cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed; simmer slowly\r\nfor fifteen minutes, season with salt and pepper, and add a little\r\nsherry if liked.\r\n\r\nIf the lentils are cooked longer, it will make a cloudy soup, which\r\nwill be stronger but not clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAR BOUILLON OR CONSOMMÉ\r\n\r\nThere are various vegetable extracts in the market which, when diluted,\r\nmake delicious stock, or clear soup. If these are not available,\r\na clear vegetable broth may be made as follows:\r\n\r\nWash 3 cups of any dried beans or lentils, and put them to soak in\r\na covered earthenware dish with 10 cups of water for twelve hours or\r\nso. Then empty with that same water into a kettle, and let come slowly\r\nto the boiling point, skim frequently, and do not let it actually\r\nboil. When clear, and there seems no further need of skimming, add 1\r\ncup each of cut onions, carrots, turnips, 1 tablespoon of parsley,\r\n1 tablespoon of salt, 1 clove of garlic, and 1 teaspoon of thyme,\r\netc., 1 tablespoon of celery seed, and 1 bay leaf.\r\n\r\nLet boil up once, and then place on the back of the stove to barely\r\nsimmer for two hours; then strain through a fine sieve, and a good\r\nbroth is made. The beans, etc., can be utilised in a deep pie, or with\r\nbrown or white sauce in crust cups, in a curry, or many other ways.\r\n\r\nTo make this into a strong, clear soup put 2 tablespoons of butter\r\nin a saucepan, and when melted add 1/2 cup each of chopped onions,\r\ncarrots, turnips, and celery, 2 cloves, and a bit of parsley; fry\r\nuntil somewhat browned, then cover with 6 cups of the broth, and\r\nlet simmer very quietly for two hours. Skim often, drain, let cool,\r\nremove any grease from the top, and to clarify add to it, when cold,\r\nthe slightly beaten yolk of 1 egg and the whites of 3, then set\r\nover a hot fire and stir vigorously, watching for the first sign\r\nof boiling. At this, remove to a place where it cannot even simmer,\r\nbut will be warm for half an hour, and strain through a fine, clean\r\ncloth. A wineglass of sherry may be added if to be served in cups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM OF ARTICHOKE\r\n\r\nScrape and slice enough Jerusalem artichokes to make 2 cups, and cover\r\nthem with cold water. Let them stand for fifteen or twenty minutes,\r\nand put them in a saucepan with 2 quarts of cold water or milk, or\r\n1 quart of each, and let them cook for an hour or until thoroughly\r\nsoft. Now rub them through a sieve with 2 cups of the stock in which\r\nthey cooked, and return to the fire. When boiling add 1 tablespoon of\r\nbutter and 1 of flour, rubbed together, and 1 teaspoon of salt and 1\r\nsaltspoon of pepper, and cook about ten minutes before adding 2 cups\r\nof hot milk, or 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of cream. Stir well and let\r\nboil up once before serving. A teaspoon of chopped parsley or chives\r\nimproves the appearance and taste of almost any cream soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM OF ARTICHOKE WITH NASTURTIUMS\r\n\r\nMake the plain cream of artichoke soup as in preceding recipe, and\r\nadd before straining 1 handful of nasturtium leaves and blossoms;\r\nor, instead, add 1 tablespoon of these, finely minced, to the soup\r\nbefore serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS SOUP\r\n\r\nUse 1 can of asparagus, cut off the tips, and lay them aside. Cut up\r\nthe stalks, cover with 4 cups of cold milk (or use half water and half\r\nmilk), and let cook slowly in a double boiler for half an hour; then\r\nstrain, pressing the asparagus well to extract the flavour. Return to\r\nthe saucepan, add 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of butter, into\r\nwhich 1 teaspoon of flour has been made smooth, season generously\r\nwith salt and pepper, add the asparagus tips, 1 cup of milk, and,\r\njust before serving, 1 tablespoon of whipped cream. A tablespoon of\r\nminced onion fried for ten minutes in butter is sometimes added to\r\nthe stalks while cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY AND TOMATO SOUP\r\n\r\nCook 1 can of tomatoes and 1 chopped Spanish onion together for\r\nfifteen minutes, then rub through a wire sieve; add 3 tablespoons of\r\npearl barley, 1 tablespoon of butter, some pepper and salt, and cook\r\nfor one hour, until the barley is soft. Re-season before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK BEAN SOUP\r\n\r\nSoak 2 cups of beans for twelve hours or more, and then drain them and\r\nput into 8 cups of cold water; add 3 whole cloves, 3 whole allspice,\r\nand 3 whole peppers, salt well and boil gently for two hours, rub\r\nthrough sieve, and reheat. Mix 1 tablespoon of thickening flour, and\r\n1 tablespoon of butter and water, and stir into the soup at boiling\r\npoint; season afresh and pour into a tureen in which are placed, neatly\r\nsliced, 1 hard-boiled egg and half a dozen seeded slices of lemon. This\r\nsoup is improved by adding 1 wineglass of sherry, or one may substitute\r\nfor it a few drops of Tomato Chutney or Worcestershire sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIAN SOUP\r\n\r\nTake 4 cups of diced turnips and put them in a saucepan with 2\r\ntablespoons of butter, and stir for ten minutes over a slow fire;\r\nthen stir in 2 cups of water, 2 teaspoons of brown sugar, and plenty\r\nof pepper and salt, and let simmer for another ten minutes; add\r\n2 cups of milk thickened with 1 tablespoon of flour, let boil up,\r\nstirring constantly, and serve with croutons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAIN BEAN SOUP\r\n\r\nWash 2 cups of any sort of dried beans and soak twelve hours or more\r\nin cold water. Before using, strain them and cover with 8 cups of\r\ncold water. Put over the fire and let cook gently for four hours,\r\nthen rub them through a sieve into their own stock, season with 1\r\ntablespoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and 1 tablespoon of\r\nbutter, and let them cook ten minutes longer. Serve with half-inch\r\nsquares of toast in the tureen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN BEAN SOUP\r\n\r\nTake 1 cup of brown beans and 1/2 cup of German lentils, wash well\r\nand put in a saucepan with plenty of cold water, 2 or 3 chopped\r\nonions, 1 stalk of celery, 1 bay leaf, and simmer together for three\r\nhours, then strain. If a thin soup is wanted, do not press any of\r\nthe pulp through the strainer, but if it is liked somewhat thick,\r\ndo so. Return the strained soup to the saucepan and thicken with\r\n1 teaspoon of thickening flour. This is now delicious soup stock,\r\nand can be served plain, or varied by adding peas, diced carrots,\r\nspaghetti, a few drops of sauce, a little sherry, tomato catsup,\r\nor curry powder. Season well with salt and pepper before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED BEAN SOUP\r\n\r\nSoak for 8 hours or more 2 cups of red beans, then put them in a large\r\nsaucepan containing 8 cups of cold water, 1 cup of milk, and 2 onions\r\nhalved, each having 4 cloves stuck in it. Let cook for two hours, then\r\npress through a sieve, reheat, adding just before serving 1 wineglass\r\nof claret and fresh seasoning of salt and pepper. 1 hard-boiled egg\r\nchopped fine is an improvement to this soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMA BEAN CREAM SOUP\r\n\r\nSoak 2 cups of dried lima beans for several hours and then put them\r\nin a saucepan with 1 cup of cold water and 1 cup of milk and let them\r\ncook for two hours, adding salt when they have partly cooked. Put\r\n1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion\r\nchopped fine. Let cook slowly until browned, then scrape the contents\r\nof the frying pan into the saucepan containing the beans, and add\r\n1 tablespoon of tomato catsup or chutney and press all through\r\na sieve, and re-season before serving. If liked a little thick,\r\nuse 1 tablespoon of flour, made smooth in 1/2 cup of milk or cream,\r\nto thicken. A tablespoon of whipped cream in the tureen is always an\r\nimprovement to a cream soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCH CABBAGE SOUP\r\n\r\nMake exactly like Cockie-Leekie soup, using the water in which a\r\ncabbage has boiled for stock and adding 1/2 cup of finely chopped\r\ncabbage instead of using any of the barley to return to the strained\r\nsoup. Those who like caraway seed will enjoy the addition of 1\r\nteaspoon of these to the soup. If used, add them with the chopped\r\ncabbage after the other seasoning has been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCUTTA BISQUE\r\n\r\nPut 1 cup of tomato pulp in a saucepan and with it 1 bay leaf. When\r\nhot add to it 1 saltspoon of soda, and as it foams stir slowly into it\r\n3 or 4 cups of milk, 1 teaspoon of curry powder, 1 teaspoon of butter,\r\nand 1 saltspoon of salt. Let boil up once and serve with croutons.\r\n\r\nThe water in which rice has boiled or any vegetable stock may be\r\nsubstituted for milk and the soda then omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTON STEW\r\n\r\nPut 2 cups of finely shredded cabbage in enough water to boil and let\r\ncook slowly until tender, which should be in about three quarters of\r\nan hour. When the cabbage has been cooking half an hour, add a cup of\r\nmilk, and when it is nearly done put in 2 cups of milk; let boil up\r\nonce, then season with salt, black pepper, and pour in a hot tureen,\r\nin which should be laid 1 teaspoon of butter. Those who like oyster\r\ncrackers served in or with milk stews can use them with this soup\r\nwhich greatly resembles an oyster stew in flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROT BROTH\r\n\r\nScrape and cut 3 or 4 large carrots (or more of the small French sort)\r\nin eighths lengthwise and boil them until tender. Put 2 tablespoons of\r\nbutter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1 scant half cup of oatmeal\r\nto it, putting in 1 tablespoon at a time and stirring carefully with\r\na wooden spoon until all the butter is taken up; then put in 1 ladle\r\nof stock in which the carrots have been cooked, and continue stirring;\r\nthen another ladle of stock, and so on until a cup and a half of stock\r\nhas been added during ten minutes' slow cooking. Now put in another cup\r\nof stock and let cook ten minutes; then, as the soup will be getting\r\ntoo thick, add another cup of stock and so on, thinning the soup with\r\nadditional stock until the oatmeal is thoroughly cooked. If Quaker\r\nOats is used, the soup will only have to cook about forty minutes,\r\nand it is best to strain it before serving; fine Scotch meal will take\r\nlonger, but does not need to be strained and thickens somewhat better.\r\n\r\nWhen the soup is half cooked add 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of\r\npepper, and a dash of nutmeg. (Serve the carrots with a plain sauce\r\nor warm them up next day in some of the ways mentioned under Carrots.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM OF CARROT AND ONION\r\n\r\nTake 2 cups of grated carrot and 1 chopped onion and fry for ten\r\nminutes with 1 tablespoon of butter and then cover with 4 cups of\r\ncold water and let boil.

Beat 2 egg-yolks in 1/2 cup of milk, and when the soup\r\nboils again stir them into it. Stir hard for one minute and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM OF CHEESE\r\n\r\nPut 1 quart (or 4 cups) of milk in a double boiler, and put with it\r\n3/4 of a cup of grated cheese, 1 teaspoon of grated onion, 1 teaspoon\r\nof some piquant sauce, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, a dash of cayenne pepper,\r\nand 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 of butter rubbed together. Stir until\r\nsmooth, then beat the yolks of 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of milk,\r\nput in the tureen, and pour the boiling soup over them, stirring\r\nduring the process. Add a little salt and serve with croutons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM OF CAULIFLOWER\r\n\r\nTake a good-sized cauliflower, and let it soak in cold water, which\r\nis slightly salted, for half an hour; then drain it and put it, head\r\nupwards, in a saucepan which is not over large, and let it cook for\r\nhalf an hour uncovered. Put in a double boiler 1 quart of milk (4\r\ncups), 1 onion and 1 bay leaf, and let them cook together while the\r\ncauliflower is boiling.

A tablespoon of whipped cream is an addition if added\r\nat the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT SOUP\r\n\r\nPeel and blanch 1 quart of Italian chestnuts and chop them fine, then\r\nboil for half an hour in 2 quarts of water. Strain the chestnuts and\r\ncrush them to fine pulp in a mortar, and gradually stir on this 1 quart\r\nof the stock in which the chestnuts cooked, and then rub all through\r\na sieve.

Put 2 tablespoons of\r\nbutter in a saucepan and fry in it when melted 1 small onion chopped\r\nfine; then add the sorrel to this and stir for three or four minutes\r\nand add 2 cups of cold milk and let simmer for five minutes. Dissolve\r\nin 1 cup of milk, 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of potato flour\r\n(or other thickening), and add to the boiling soup; then strain,\r\nreheat, and serve with the addition of 1 tablespoon of whipped cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SORREL SOUP\r\n\r\nThe Germans enrich the above soup by pouring it upon a 1/2 cup of\r\nmilk in which the yolks of 2 eggs have been beaten. Do not reverse\r\nthe process, as it will curdle the soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GERMAIN SOUP\r\n\r\nTake 2 cans of peas, reserving 1/2 cup of them, and put them in a\r\ndouble boiler with 1 onion cut in 4 pieces with a clove stuck in each,\r\n1 tablespoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1\r\nbay leaf, and a sprig of parsley; cover and let cook for half an hour,\r\nthen mash the contents of the double boiler with a potato-masher,\r\nand add to them 6 cups of water, and when this boils add to the soup\r\n2 tablespoons of butter and 2 of flour rubbed together; stir well\r\nand cook fifteen minutes, then press through a sieve. Return to the\r\ndouble boiler, add 2 cups of milk, the 1/2 cup of peas drained dry,\r\nand reheat, seasoning afresh before serving with croutons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAGHETTI SOUP\r\n\r\nMelt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large saucepan, and add to it 1\r\nthinly sliced onion, 2 slices of carrot, 2 slices of turnip, 1/2 cup\r\nof chopped celery (or 1 teaspoon of celery seed may be used instead),\r\nand let cook very slowly. Stir frequently, and at the end of ten\r\nminutes add 2 cloves, 10 or 12 peppercorns, a small piece of cinnamon,\r\nand 1 large bay leaf, and 8 cups (or 2 quarts) of cold water. Cover\r\nthe saucepan and let the soup cook slowly three quarters of an hour,\r\nthen strain carefully and return to the saucepan. Season with 1\r\nteaspoon of salt, and add 1/2 cup of spaghetti broken into inch-long\r\npieces. Cover the saucepan and let the soup simmer for an hour, as\r\nthis will draw more flavour from the spaghetti than rapid boiling,\r\nand is the better way for a soup, since the object is to extract the\r\nflavour of the ingredients. Grated or Parmesan cheese served with\r\nthis soup is an improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTCH BROTH\r\n\r\nPut 2 quarts of water in kettle, and when at boiling point add 1/2 cup\r\nof pearl barley, which has been tossed in hot butter in a frying pan\r\nfor five minutes, and let cook slowly. Cut up 2 carrots, 2 turnips,\r\nand 3 large onions, and fry in 2 tablespoons of butter. Chop a sprig\r\nof parsley very fine, and put with the other vegetables into the barley\r\nand water. Let cook slowly for two hours, season with pepper and salt,\r\nand serve. A 1/2 teaspoon of soup-browning improves the appearance\r\nof the broth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH TOMATO SOUP\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted stir into\r\nit 3 onions thinly sliced, and let simmer for ten minutes; then add\r\nto them the juice from 1 can of tomatoes and 2 of the tomatoes, and\r\nlet cook slowly for twenty minutes; strain, pressing through a sieve,\r\nreturn to the fire, add 1 tablespoon of butter, some pepper and salt,\r\nand stir in 2 well-beaten eggs. Do not let the soup boil after adding\r\nthe eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO-TAPIOCA SOUP\r\n\r\nPut 2 quarts of water into a double boiler, and when it boils add\r\n1/2 cup of tapioca. Slice 6 large tomatoes (or use 2 cups of strained\r\ncanned tomatoes), cut 2 onions fine, and fry together until a light\r\nbrown in 1 tablespoon of butter. Scrape the contents of the pan into\r\nthe kettle and let simmer slowly for an hour and a half, then season\r\nwell and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO CREAM SOUP\r\n\r\nTake 2 cups of canned tomatoes, juice and all, mash the large\r\npieces to a pulp, and place in a saucepan with 1 1/2 cups of hot\r\nwater and a piece of butter the size of an egg, a pinch of pepper,\r\n1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 bay leaf. Let come to a boil, and then\r\nadd 1/4 teaspoon of carbonate of soda, stir for one minute, and add\r\n2 cups of milk. Let boil up and pour in tureen in which is a 1/2 cup\r\nof cracker crumbs very finely rolled. Use this way for ordinary use,\r\nor strain to serve in cups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO AND CORN BISQUE\r\n\r\nPut 1 quart of milk and 1 can of corn in a double boiler and let\r\nsimmer fifteen minutes; then add 1 teaspoon of butter, season well\r\nwith salt and pepper, and press through a sieve, and put back into\r\nthe double boiler. Add 1/2 cup of boiled tomatoes which have been\r\npressed through a sieve, stir together, reheat, and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO-MACARONI SOUP\r\n\r\nPut 1 can of tomatoes, 1 sprig of parsley, 1 onion with 4 cloves stuck\r\nin it, 1 tablespoon of salt, 6 peppercorns, and 6 cups of cold water\r\nin a saucepan, and let cook slowly for three quarters of an hour;\r\nthen strain and return to the saucepan, and when boiling again, add\r\n1/2 cup of macaroni which has been broken into small pieces, and cover\r\nand cook for half an hour. Season afresh before serving. Spaghetti\r\nor noodles may be used instead of macaroni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO SOUP\r\n\r\nLet 1 quart can of tomatoes, 2 cups of water (or rice stock),\r\na sprig of parsley, 1 bay leaf, and 1 onion simmer together for\r\nfifteen minutes, then press through a sieve and return to the fire to\r\nboil. Rub 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of flour together,\r\nand stir into the boiling soup until smooth. Add salt, pepper, and\r\na pinch of soda, and serve immediately with croutons. If water in\r\nwhich rice has boiled is used omit the flour and the soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO-OKRA SOUP\r\n\r\nInto 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) of boiling water put 1/2 cup of rice;\r\ncover and let boil fifteen minutes, then add the contents of 1 can\r\nof \"tomato-okra\" and cook ten minutes more. Reserve 2 okra pods, 2\r\ntomatoes, and 1 tablespoon of rice, and press all the rest through a\r\nsieve. Return to the fire, season with salt and pepper, and add the\r\nrice and tomatoes and the okra cut in thin slices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMULLIGATAWNY SOUP\r\n\r\nMake as above, but strain, reserving a little rice and a little\r\ntomato to add later; stir 1 tablespoon of curry paste (or powder)\r\ninto the soup, reheat, and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 1\r\n\r\nCut in tiny squares 1 potato, 1 onion, 1/2 turnip, 1 carrot, and 1\r\nroot of celery. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, add all\r\nthe vegetables except the potato, and fry until a delicate brown. Then\r\nscrape the contents of the frying pan into a kettle containing 2 quarts\r\nof cold water, 1 teaspoon of salt, 3 tablespoons of rice, 1 bay leaf,\r\nand a bunch of soup herbs. Let cook slowly for one hour and a half,\r\nand then add the potatoes and boil twenty minutes more. Add pepper,\r\na little fresh salt, and 1 teaspoon soup-browning, and, if a thin\r\nsoup is preferred, strain out most of the vegetables and rice. These\r\nmay be served with brown sauce and put in individual crust cups made\r\nhot in oven after being filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 2\r\n\r\nWhen seasonable another vegetable soup may be made, proceeding as\r\nabove, but adding cauliflower and young onions instead of carrots,\r\netc., and thinning with 1 1/2 cups of hot milk and adding at the\r\nlast 1/2 cup of boiled young peas. Add butter, pepper, and salt,\r\nand a spoonful of cream, before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 3\r\n\r\nPut 1 generous tablespoon of butter in a large saucepan, and fry in\r\nthe butter when melted 1/2 cup of chopped onion, and when a golden\r\nbrown stir in carefully 1 tablespoon of flour, and when smoothed\r\npour on slowly 2 cups of hot water or vegetable stock. Now put in\r\n1/2 cup each of chopped carrot, turnip, parsnip, and 1 cup of celery,\r\nand dredge well with pepper and salt, and cover with boiling water,\r\nand let simmer for one hour. Then put in 2 cups of parboiled potatoes,\r\nand when the vegetables are soft press through a sieve with the stock\r\nin which they have cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 4\r\n\r\nA much more simple but very palatable vegetable soup is made by taking\r\n1 cup of diced carrots and 1 cup of parsnips and 1 can of peas (or\r\nfewer peas can be used), covering them with cold water, and after\r\none hour's boiling adding 2 cups of milk, to which should be added\r\nwhen it boils 1 teaspoon of potato-flour, or other thickening, and,\r\nbefore serving, pepper, salt, and a small piece of butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE SOUP. NO. 5\r\n\r\nSlice and cut in fancy shapes 1 turnip, 1 carrot, 1 sweet potato,\r\nthe corn from 1 ear of corn, or use 2 tablespoons of canned corn,\r\nand strain 1/2 can of peas, or 1/2 cup of fresh peas may be used. Put\r\n3 quarts of water in a saucepan, and when boiling add 1 tablespoon of\r\nrice and the carrot; let boil for half an hour, then put in the other\r\nvegetables and cook for half an hour longer, and add 1 tablespoon\r\nof chopped parsley before serving; also season highly with salt\r\nand pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUP\r\n\r\nMelt 3 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and add 3 tablespoons\r\neach of chopped celery, turnip, and carrot, and 1 tablespoon of minced\r\nonion, 4 bay leaves, and 4 blades of mace. Cook together very slowly\r\nfor twenty minutes, stirring frequently to prevent browning; then\r\nshake in 3 tablespoons of flour, and when blended put the contents of\r\nthe frying pan into a little less than 3 pints of milk made hot in a\r\ndouble boiler. Cook twenty minutes longer, and then season well with\r\nsalt and pepper, and pour into a saucepan containing 2 egg-yolks,\r\nbeaten with 1/2 cup of cream or milk. The soup can then be strained\r\nand served without any, or with only a few, of the vegetables, or\r\nit is delicious served without straining. It can be made at any time\r\nthat is convenient and reheated for serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPURÉE OF VEGETABLE MARROW\r\n(SUMMER SQUASH)\r\n\r\nSlice 3 onions and cover with 2 quarts of cold water, and when it\r\nboils add a large vegetable marrow, cut in thin slices.

Drain and arrange in a buttered baking dish;\r\npour over them 3 tablespoons of melted butter, and sprinkle the tops\r\nwith browned bread crumbs finely rolled, and set them in the oven\r\nfor five minutes.\r\n\r\nThis dish makes a dainty entremets when served in individual gratin\r\ndishes, in which case 2 or 3 artichokes should be arranged in each\r\ndish. The little dish should be served on a small plate with a\r\npaper doiley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKES AU GRATIN\r\n\r\nPrepare the artichokes as in above recipe, arrange them in a large\r\nbaking dish, or in small individual dishes, cover them with white\r\nsauce, sprinkle the top with grated cheese and crumbs, and put them\r\nin the oven a few minutes to brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKES WITH TOMATO SAUCE\r\n\r\nPrepare the artichokes as in the first recipe, but instead of using\r\nmelted butter use a little tomato sauce, and sprinkle the artichokes\r\nwith browned crumbs, and let  heat a few moments in the oven before\r\nserving. This also is a dainty dish to serve after the soup in\r\nindividual gratin dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKES WITH FRENCH SAUCE\r\n\r\nPrepare as directed, and in the water in which the artichokes are\r\nboiling put 1 large onion and a piece of celery finely chopped. After\r\nremoving the artichokes take enough of the stock for a sauce, season\r\nit nicely, thicken with the yolk of an egg, and strain and pour over\r\nthe hot artichokes and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKE FRITTERS\r\n\r\nBoil the artichokes not more than fifteen minutes, cut them into strips\r\n1/4 of an inch thick, dry them, dip them in flour, and then in batter,\r\nand fry a golden brown in good butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED ARTICHOKES\r\n\r\nBoil as directed, but do not quite finish cooking; let them cool,\r\nslice them and fry in melted butter, adding 1 teaspoon of chopped\r\nparsley just before removing from the pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH FRIED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES\r\n\r\nScrape and wash 1 quart of Jerusalem artichokes, cut in slices\r\nlengthwise, and fry in a frying basket in hot vegetable fat or oil\r\nuntil a golden brown. Serve with a sprinkling of lemon juice, or with\r\nDutch butter and browned crumbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKES TARTARE\r\n\r\nSelect small artichokes, or cut them round with a patent cutter, roll\r\nthem in yolk of egg and then in fine crumbs, place in a frying basket,\r\nand fry in hot vegetable fat until a golden brown. Serve very hot,\r\ngarnished with parsley, and with a tureen of sauce Tartare. Serve\r\nalone after soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED ARTICHOKES WITH TOMATO SAUCE\r\n\r\nFry artichokes as in foregoing recipe and serve with hot tomato sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKES LYONNAISE\r\n\r\nBoil the artichokes as directed, but do net let them quite finish\r\ncooking, then slice them. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying\r\npan, and when melted add 1 large onion sliced or chopped, and when\r\nonions are transparent, but not brown, add the artichokes and fry\r\nslowly. Sprinkle with chopped parsley or chives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKE PURÉE\r\n\r\nBoil 1 quart of artichokes as already directed, drain, mash and press\r\nthrough a fine sieve, and stir in 2 tablespoons of melted butter;\r\nthen stir over a low fire until the moisture is exhausted. Remove\r\nfrom the fire, and when cold add 4 eggs which have been well beaten,\r\nbeating them briskly, and adding them slowly to the purée; also beat\r\nin 1 tablespoon of whipped cream. When thoroughly mixed and light\r\nfrom much beating put into a large mould, or into individual moulds,\r\nand steam or poach with water half-way up the mould, and turn out and\r\nserve with some good sauce, tomato or Hollandaise preferred, or the\r\nsauce described as being made with the water in which the artichokes\r\nwere boiled can be used; to it should be added 1 teaspoon of finely\r\nchopped parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKES NEWBURG\r\n\r\nMake a sauce with 2 cups of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter mixed with\r\n1 of flour, 2 yolks of eggs, and pepper and salt, and when thickened\r\nadd 2 tablespoons of sherry, and 3 cups of sliced boiled artichokes,\r\nand 1/2 cup of blanched chopped almonds. Serve on toast or in cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH OR GLOBE ARTICHOKES\r\n\r\nThe globe artichoke is a most delicious addition to a vegetarian\r\nmenu, and it is not because it is not known to be edible, but because\r\nmany people do not know how either to eat it or to serve it, that\r\nit is not oftener seen in America. I have had it served to me in\r\nalmost every European country and often in restaurants in America,\r\nand have never encountered but one cook who knew how it should be\r\nsent to the table after cooking, and one waiter who knew how to serve\r\nit when it got there. It is usually served half cold with the leaves\r\nfalling all about it because the \"thistle,\" and usually the best of\r\nthe artichoke besides, has been carelessly removed in the kitchen;\r\ninstead of which it should be served whole, as in this way only can\r\nit be kept hot enough to be palatable. The artichoke should be set\r\nstem end downward on a hot, flat dish and wound about at the base\r\nwith a small table napkin, and the person who serves it, holding\r\nit in the napkin, should reverse it and taking a small, sharp,\r\nsilvered knife should cut through the artichoke on the bottom, using\r\na sawing motion, and with the help of a serving fork ease apart the\r\n\"thistle\" and the closely knitted small leaves in the centre. Unless\r\nthe artichokes are very large ones, a half of one is not too much to\r\nserve each person. The \"thistle\" should be removed by the server,\r\nand this should be done by carefully separating it from the \"fond\"\r\nor base, which is the fleshy part from which the leaves grow out. The\r\nleaves should be taken one by one, by the dry tip, in the fingers,\r\nand the fleshy end thus pulled from the base should be dipped in the\r\nsauce served, and the soft portion removed by drawing it between the\r\nfront teeth; when the leaves are finished the base should be cut up\r\nwith a fork and eaten with the sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STEAM GLOBE ARTICHOKES\r\n\r\nPrepare for cooking as in the above recipe, place in a covered steamer,\r\nand let steam forty minutes or until the leaves, when pulled, part\r\neasily from the base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BOIL GLOBE ARTICHOKES\r\n\r\nGlobe artichokes should not look dry and wrinkled when bought, but\r\ngreen and fresh. Put them in cold salted water and a little vinegar\r\nfor fifteen minutes to cleanse and free from insects, then put them\r\nin salted boiling water and boil until the leaves part easily from\r\nthe base when pulled; this should be in about half an hour, but the\r\ntime varies with the age and size of the artichoke; it should then\r\nbe drained and the stem cut off so that it will stand erect on the\r\nserving dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOBE ARTICHOKES STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nCut the stalk from fresh artichokes and trim the leaves to an even\r\nlength, and boil them for twenty minutes, or until the choke or thistle\r\ncan be removed neatly. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan,\r\nand when melted add 2 finely minced shallots (or use chives or onion\r\ntops), and 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, and 1 cup of chopped fresh\r\nor canned mushrooms, salt and pepper, and fry all together for five\r\nminutes. Fill the artichoke with this, tie the leaves together and\r\nset in a pan containing 1 cup of stock (or water), 2 tablespoons\r\nof butter or olive oil, and bake them half an hour, basting them\r\nthoroughly five or six times. Remove the strings, set upright and\r\nserve very hot with Dutch butter, or any sauce preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOBE ARTICHOKES VINAIGRETTE\r\n\r\nServe cold boiled artichokes, which have been cut in half and the\r\n\"thistles\" removed, with sauce vinaigrette, which is French dressing\r\nto which a little chopped onion or onion juice and chopped parsley\r\nhave been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFONDS D'ARTICHAUT\r\n\r\nThe bottom or solid part of the globe artichoke can be bought preserved\r\nin bottles; heat them in their own liquid, drain, and serve hot with\r\nHollandaise sauce, or cold with sauce vinaigrette or mayonnaise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS\r\n\r\nAsparagus should be carefully looked over and washed, and then\r\ntied into a bunch with a piece of tape, with all the heads level,\r\nthen with a very sharp knife an inch or two of the stalks should\r\nbe so evenly cut off that the bunch will stand upright. Stand the\r\nasparagus in a deep saucepan so that the tips are well out of the\r\nwater, add 1 teaspoon of salt, put a cover on the saucepan, and let\r\ncook about half an hour or twenty-five minutes. In this way the tips\r\nare sufficiently steamed by the time the stalks are cooked, and will\r\nnot be cooked to pieces as when immersed in water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS WITH WHITE SAUCE\r\n\r\nHaving boiled the asparagus as directed, lift it out by plunging a\r\nsharp fork into it two or three inches from the bottom, lay it on a\r\nhot plate on the top of the stove, cut the tape and arrange 4 or 5\r\npieces each on long strips of toast, and pour over each 2 tablespoons\r\nof nicely seasoned white sauce; arrange neatly on a long platter with\r\nthe asparagus heads all turned one way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS WITH DUTCH BUTTER\r\n\r\nProceed exactly as in above recipe, but instead of the white sauce\r\npour a little melted butter over all, and serve with a small tureen\r\nof Dutch butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOT ASPARAGUS TIPS\r\n\r\nTake a can of asparagus tips, drain and put in a saucepan with\r\n2 tablespoons of melted butter into which some paprika has been\r\nshaken. When hot garnish with diamonds of toast to serve, and sprinkle\r\nwith salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ASPARAGUS\r\n\r\nOpen canned asparagus at the bottom, and after draining, ease it\r\nfrom the can, so as to prevent the tips from being injured. Lay the\r\nstalks evenly in a shallow enamelled pan, cover with hot water or\r\nthe juice from the can, and let heat through over a slow fire. Remove\r\nafter ten minutes' cooking to a heated flat dish, using a strainer to\r\nlift the stalks from the water. Serve with Dutch butter, into which\r\na few browned crumbs have been stirred, or chopped chives can be used\r\ninstead of crumbs. The asparagus can also be served with tomato sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS VINAIGRETTE\r\n\r\nPlace the can of asparagus to be used on the ice for half an hour,\r\nthen open and drain and rinse carefully in cold water. Place on\r\ncrisp lettuce leaves, using 5 or 6 stalks on each, and serve with\r\nsauce vinaigrette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED TIPS WITH ONION BUTTER\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1\r\ntablespoon of grated onion and the drained contents of 1 can of\r\nasparagus tips. Let all cook together slowly for five minutes, and\r\nseason with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS TIPS WITH WHITE SAUCE\r\n\r\nHeat 1 can of asparagus tips with 1 tablespoon of melted butter,\r\nand to serve, cover with 3/4 of a cup of highly seasoned white sauce\r\nin which the white of 1 hard-boiled egg has been mixed, after being\r\nchopped fine. Sprinkle over the top the yolk of the egg pressed\r\nthrough a sieve, and serve with squares of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS IN BREAD CASES\r\n\r\nBoil 2 cups of asparagus tips in salted water for fifteen minutes,\r\nand then drain them; while they are cooking put 1 cup of milk in a\r\ndouble boiler, and when boiling pour some of it on to 2 lightly beaten\r\neggs, stirring vigorously meanwhile, and then put the eggs into the\r\ndouble boiler with the milk, and stir until it begins to thicken. Add 1\r\nteaspoon of butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 saltspoon of pepper,\r\nand remove from the fire. Cut the asparagus tops into half-inch pieces\r\nand add them to the sauce. Take 5 stale rolls, cut off the tops,\r\nremove the inside, and let them dry in the oven; when crisp and hot\r\nfill each with the asparagus in sauce, replace the top and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCALLOPED ASPARAGUS\r\n\r\nUse either fresh green asparagus, or canned asparagus. Cut it into\r\ntwo-inch lengths, and if fresh is used cook in boiling water for\r\nten minutes. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan and brown\r\nin it 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of finely chopped roasted\r\npeanuts. Roll each bit of asparagus in beaten egg and the crumbs and\r\nnut mixture, and arrange in a buttered gratin dish with alternate\r\nlayers of thick white sauce, seasoning each layer with a little pepper\r\nand salt. Cover the top with crumbs and a sprinkling of grated cheese,\r\nand brown in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIDDLED APPLES\r\n\r\nPeel and core large sour apples. Cut them in thick slices and lay\r\non a well-buttered griddle, and let fry until a light brown; turn,\r\nand brown the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE FRITTERS\r\n\r\nPare and core as many tart apples as required, sprinkle with salt,\r\ndip in batter, and fry until golden brown in hot fat. Drain on brown\r\npaper before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED BANANAS\r\n\r\nPut bananas unpeeled into boiling water, let boil for ten minutes,\r\nthen peel and cut in two and serve with melted butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANANAS WITH TOMATOES\r\n\r\nPeel 3 bananas and cut them in slices either lengthwise or across, and\r\nslice 3 or 4 large tomatoes. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying\r\npan, and when melted lay in the bananas and tomatoes and sprinkle\r\nwell with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let cook slowly,\r\nand when browned on the bottom turn and add another sprinkling of\r\nsugar, brown again, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANANA FRITTERS\r\n\r\nPare the bananas required, cut each in half crosswise, and then split\r\neach half. Sprinkle with salt and dip in batter and fry until a golden\r\nbrown in hot fat. Drain on brown paper and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON BAKED BEANS\r\n\r\nCover with cold water 3 or 4 cups of dry California pea beans, or\r\nany small white beans, and let them soak over night. The next morning\r\ndrain and put on the stove in a large kettle well filled with water,\r\nand let cook slowly, with 1/4 of a teaspoon of soda added, for half\r\nan hour. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in the bean-pot, or a deep\r\nbaking dish, drain the beans, and put them in the butter. Pour over\r\nthem slowly 4 tablespoons of dark molasses, 1 tablespoon of salt,\r\nand add 1 tablespoon of butter; then fill the bean-pot to the top\r\nwith hot water and bake in a very slow oven for 6 or 7 hours. As\r\nthe water cooks away replace it. This will require doing about three\r\ntimes during the baking. Serve in the dish in which they were cooked,\r\nand garnish with whole black pickled walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN STRING BEANS\r\n\r\nIf fresh beans are used pick them over, remove the ends and\r\n\"strings,\" and boil for half an hour or more; then drain them, and\r\nadd 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of milk, season with\r\nsalt and pepper, and serve after ten minutes' slow cooking. If canned\r\nbeans are used omit the first long boiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN WAX BEANS\r\n\r\nIf fresh beans are used wash, remove the ends and \"strings,\" and\r\nboil for three quarters of an hour, or until tender, in salted water;\r\nthen drain and add to them 1 tablespoon of butter, and 2 tablespoons\r\nof milk, let cook slowly for ten minutes, and season well with salt\r\nand pepper. In using canned beans omit the first boiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH BEANS (FLAGEOLETS)\r\n\r\nThose in glass are the best; drain and put in a double boiler with 1\r\ntablespoon of butter, pepper and salt, and 1 tablespoon of cream. Serve\r\nvery hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIED BEANS DEUTSCHLAND\r\n\r\nPick over 1 1/2 cups of dried beans of any sort, cover with water,\r\nand soak ten hours or more. Drain and put in boiling water (or the\r\nstock onions or leeks have boiled in), and let cook slowly for two\r\nhours, or until tender but unbroken, then drain. Put 2 tablespoons\r\nof butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion chopped fine,\r\nand let it cook slowly for ten minutes; then add the beans and season\r\nwith salt and pepper and put over them 2 tablespoons of lemon juice\r\nor 1 tablespoon of \"reduced vinegar,\" and let cook very slowly for\r\nten or fifteen minutes that all may be well blended before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE BEANS FLORENTINE\r\n\r\nSoak 4 cups of white kidney beans for ten hours, then boil them two\r\nhours. Slip the skins off and put them into a saucepan with 1 cup\r\nof broth and a bunch of sweet herbs, 1 bay leaf, and 2 tablespoons\r\nof Marsala or sherry. Cover and let them cook slowly for thirty\r\nminutes. Remove the herbs and stir in 1 tablespoon of butter and\r\n1 tablespoon of flour rubbed well together, stir until smooth, and\r\nthen pour on 1 cup of cream or milk into which 1 egg has been beaten;\r\ncontinue to stir, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of\r\nchopped parsley, and serve with grated cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEANS AND CORN ESCALLOPED\r\n\r\nUse 1 can of green string beans, or Lima beans, and 1 can of sweet\r\ncorn. Butter a baking dish, and arrange a layer of beans; dot with\r\nbutter, and season with pepper and salt, then put on this a layer of\r\ncorn about half an inch deep, season, and so proceed until the dish\r\nis filled. Then pour 1/2 cup of milk over all, sprinkle with bread\r\ncrumbs, and bake for fifteen minutes, or until the crumbs are browned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN BEANS\r\n\r\nUse 3 cups of white haricot beans, soak for several hours, boil two\r\nhours in salted water, then drain. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a\r\nsaucepan, and when melted add 1 large onion chopped fine and 2 bay\r\nleaves. Let cook slowly for eight minutes, then put into the pan the\r\nboiled beans, and season with salt and pepper; let heat through,\r\nstirring gently, and add 1 cup of tomato sauce two minutes before\r\nremoving from the fire.\r\n\r\nCanned brown or red beans may be used, giving the same dish practically\r\nwith far less trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH BEANS\r\n\r\nSoak for eight or ten hours any sort of large dried beans, then drain\r\nthem and put them into boiling water two hours or more, or until\r\ncooked. One way of testing them is to remove a few and blow on them;\r\nif the skins crack they are done. Drain, and put them in a bean-pot\r\nor casserole and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of chopped onion and 2\r\ncups of strained tomatoes, and dredge well with salt. Cover the dish\r\nand bake slowly for an hour. A quarter of an hour before taking out,\r\npour over them 1 tablespoon of melted butter and remove the cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMA BEANS\r\n\r\nLet Lima beans stand in cold water for an hour or so after they are\r\nshelled, and in cooking them allow 8 cups of water to every 4 cups\r\nof beans. Put them in boiling salted water, and let them cook for\r\nan hour, or more if not fresh picked. Drain them and add 1/2 cup of\r\nthe water they cooked in, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter,\r\nand season highly with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nDried beans must soak ten or twelve hours and cook two hours. Canned\r\nLima beans only need reheating, draining, and a little milk and butter\r\nand seasoning added to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMA BEANS HOLLANDAISE\r\n\r\nBoil 1 quart of beans until tender, salting them well when half\r\ncooked. Beat a large tablespoon of butter to a cream, beat in the\r\nyolk of 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley, 1 saltspoon\r\nof black pepper, and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice; when this sauce is\r\nwell mixed stir it into the beans, taking care not to break them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED LIMA BEANS\r\n\r\nCover 2 cups of boiled Lima beans with 1 scant cup of cream, and let\r\nsimmer in a double boiler for ten minutes; then add 1 teaspoon of\r\nbutter, and season with salt, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMA BEAN SAUQUETASH\r\n\r\nBoil 2 cups of freshly picked Lima beans in 1 quart of water for half\r\nan hour, then drain them and add 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter,\r\nand enough green corn cut from the cob to make 2 cups. Season well,\r\nand let simmer for fifteen minutes, and salt again before serving.\r\n\r\nIf canned corn and canned beans are used they need be cooked for only\r\nten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEETS\r\n\r\nGreat care should be taken in washing beets that the small rootlets\r\nare not broken or the skin of the beet bruised, as anything which\r\ncauses the juice to escape injures both the taste and the colour. In\r\nthe city, beets are seldom obtainable which require less than two or\r\nthree hours' cooking; but really young, small beets should not require\r\nmore than one hour's boiling. When boiled they should be drained, then\r\nplunged into cold water, after which the skin can be rubbed off with\r\nthe hand. Some, however, prefer that beets should be baked or steamed;\r\nthe time required to cook will then be somewhat longer. Canned beets\r\nare a great convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED BEETS\r\n\r\nBoil 6 or 7 medium-sized beets until tender, then remove them from the\r\nsaucepan and place them in cold water; rub the skins off carefully\r\nwith the hands, and cut them in half-inch cubes. Make a sauce of 2\r\ntablespoons of butter creamed with 2 tablespoons of flour and 1/2 cup\r\nof the water in which the beets were boiled, 2 tablespoons of cream,\r\n2 tablespoons of vinegar, 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt,\r\nand 1 saltspoon of pepper. Pour the sauce over the hot beets and\r\nserve in a heated deep dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA BEETS\r\n\r\nCarefully peel boiled beets, and with a sharp knife cut into very thin,\r\neven slices, laying them as sliced into a heated vegetable dish; when\r\na layer has been made over the bottom, dot it well with butter, season\r\nlightly with salt, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar;\r\nthen arrange another layer of beets with butter, salt, and sugar, and\r\nproceed in this way until the dish is filled. The work should be done\r\nnear the fire in order that the beets may not cool, as the dish should\r\nbe served very hot. If, however, the beets have cooled in preparation,\r\nset them in a hot oven for a few minutes, and turn them with a spoon\r\nin the dish before serving in order that they may be juicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICQUANT BEETS\r\n\r\nPeel hot cooked beets, cut into slices, and toss about for three or\r\nfour minutes in a saucepan which contains 3 tablespoons of butter to\r\nwhich has been added 1 teaspoon of plain vinegar, or a few drops of\r\ntarragon, 2 cloves, and 1 teaspoon of sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN BEETS\r\n\r\nMake a sauce of 1 tablespoon of butter, when melted add 1 tablespoon of\r\nflour, 2 teaspoons of onion juice, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon\r\nof sugar, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and enough hot water to make\r\nthe sauce the right consistency; then add freshly sliced cooked beets,\r\nand let cook together three or four minutes before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED BEETS\r\n\r\nPlace slices of cold beets in a deep porcelain or glass receptacle,\r\nplace some peppercorns among them, and a few allspice, cover with\r\nmild vinegar, and let stand ten or twelve hours before using.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS\r\n\r\nBrussels sprouts are best if laid for ten minutes, after trimming\r\nand looking over, in salted cold water which contains some lemon\r\njuice. They should then be drained and put in a large saucepan filled\r\nwith boiling water containing salt and a pinch of soda. Parboil in this\r\nten minutes, then lift them with a strainer and put in a steamer above\r\nthe boiling water; cover, and let steam half an hour to finish cooking.\r\n\r\nIf sprouts are cooked by boiling instead of steaming, leave\r\nthe saucepan uncovered, as this will keep the odour from being\r\npronounced. Boil in salted water from twenty to thirty minutes,\r\ndrain the instant they are tender, and serve with melted butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS IN DUTCH BUTTER\r\n\r\nPut boiled Brussels sprouts in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons of\r\nmelted butter, to which has been added a tablespoon of lemon juice;\r\nstir until hot and add pepper and salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH CELERY\r\n\r\nTrim and wash in cold running water 1 quart of Brussels sprouts;\r\nthen place them in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and let them\r\nboil for five minutes; then drain and cover with fresh boiling water\r\ncontaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Boil for another twenty-five minutes\r\nuncovered, and then drain them. Wash enough celery to make 1 1/2\r\ncups when cut in pieces one inch long, put this in a saucepan with\r\n3 tablespoons of butter, stir well together, and add 1 1/2 cups of\r\nscalded milk containing 2 tablespoons of flour; when this is thickened\r\nadd the sprouts, season with salt and pepper, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH CHESTNUTS\r\n\r\nTo every cup of Brussels sprouts allow 1/2 cup of blanched chestnuts\r\nwhich have been cooked for fifteen minutes; put the sprouts and\r\nchestnuts together, cook another forty minutes, drain, and serve with\r\nwhite sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS LYONNAISE\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1\r\ntablespoon of chopped onion; when this is beginning to brown add 4\r\ncups of boiled sprouts, and stir together for three or four minutes,\r\nunless the sprouts were cold, in which case they should be tossed\r\nabout with the butter and onion until hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED BRUSSELS SPROUTS\r\n\r\nCover freshly boiled Brussels sprouts with a white sauce made entirely\r\nof milk, or of the stock in which they were cooked, with 1 tablespoon\r\nof cream added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS IN BREAD CASES\r\n\r\nCut stale bread into three-inch squares, and with a sharp knife cut\r\nout the centre, leaving a bottom and four sides like a box; brush over\r\nwith melted butter, and brown in the oven. Serve sprouts prepared in\r\nany of the above ways in these cases; the creamed sprouts are perhaps\r\nthe best served this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE\r\n\r\nWash cabbage carefully after cutting it in half, and let it boil\r\nfor five minutes in well-salted boiling water; pour this water off\r\nand re-cover with fresh boiling water; let cook for half an hour,\r\nthen add 1 teaspoon of salt, and let finish cooking, which will be\r\nin about another half an hour for a medium-sized cabbage.\r\n\r\nCabbage should never be covered while boiling, as covering increases\r\nthe odour in cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND CABBAGE\r\n\r\nCut a cabbage in quarters, wash it thoroughly, and parboil it for\r\nfive minutes in salted water; then drain and cook with 2 carrots and\r\n2 turnips for an hour or until tender, in any strong vegetable stock,\r\nto which 1 tablespoon of butter has been added. Drain and dampen with\r\na little of the stock to serve, and season well with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN CABBAGE\r\n\r\nTake 4 or 5 cups of shredded white cabbage and put in a frying pan\r\nin which 1 tablespoon of butter has been melted. Press the cabbage\r\ninto the pan, dredge with salt and pepper, and pour over it 1/2 cup\r\nof vinegar and 1/2 cup of water; cover and let cook very gently for\r\nhalf an hour or somewhat less.\r\n\r\nRed cabbage can be prepared in this same way, and a pretty dish is\r\nmade by using equal quantities of red and white cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE SARMAS\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1 onion\r\nchopped fine, and after it has cooked gently for ten minutes stir into\r\nit 1 cup of boiled rice, 1/2 cup of chopped nuts, 1 teaspoon of salt,\r\n1 saltspoon of pepper, and 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Parboil\r\na small cabbage for fifteen minutes, then separate its leaves, and\r\ninto each leaf roll 1 tablespoon of the force-meat; pack tightly in\r\na shallow pan, dredge with salt and pepper, and cover with the water\r\nin which the cabbage cooked; lay 2 bay leaves on the top, and let\r\nsimmer for fifteen minutes. Serve with melted butter or tomato sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE LICHTENSTEIN\r\n\r\nCut one large cabbage into small pieces, not using the stalk. Wash\r\nwell and put in a kettle of boiling water with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1\r\ntablespoon of caraway seed. Cook for half an hour uncovered, then add\r\nto the cabbage 4 large potatoes peeled and quartered, season afresh\r\nwith salt, and let cook another twenty minutes. Put 2 tablespoons of\r\nbutter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion chopped fine and\r\n1 tablespoon of flour; let all cook together until brown, then scrape\r\nthe contents of the frying pan into the cabbage, etc., and cook slowly\r\nfor twenty minutes more, or until the stock is almost cooked away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY CABBAGE\r\n\r\nBoil firm white cabbage fifteen minutes, changing the water then for\r\nmore from the boiling teakettle; continue boiling for half an hour or\r\nuntil tender, then drain and set aside until perfectly cold. Chop fine,\r\nseason with pepper and salt, add 1 or 2 well-beaten eggs, 1 tablespoon\r\nof butter, and 1/2 cup of rich milk. Stir all well together and bake in\r\na buttered dish until brown. The oven should be moderately hot, and the\r\nsame care used as in the baking of a custard. Serve in the baking dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD SLAW\r\n\r\nPut 2 tablespoons of vinegar on to boil in a saucepan, and add to\r\nit when boiling 1/2 cup of sour or fresh milk or cream containing\r\n2 lightly beaten eggs; stir and then add 1 tablespoon of butter,\r\nsalt and pepper, and pour over 4 cups of shredded cabbage arranged\r\nin a deep bowl. Serve cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN RED CABBAGE\r\n\r\nPut 3 or 4 cups of shredded red cabbage into a saucepan with 1\r\ntablespoon of butter, 1 finely chopped apple, and the juice of half\r\na lemon; sprinkle lightly with sugar, season with salt and pepper,\r\ncover, and let cook from half to three quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGARIAN CABBAGE\r\n\r\nQuarter a red cabbage, remove the stalk parts and wash well, and\r\nput it in a kettle containing enough boiling water to cover it. Let\r\nboil for three quarters of an hour or until tender, and then drain,\r\ngently pressing out all the water. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a\r\nfrying pan, and when melted add 1 onion chopped fine and 1 tablespoon\r\nof flour; stir until smooth and let cook until brown. Then add 1/2\r\ncup of brown sugar, 1/3 of a cup of vinegar, and salt well. Add the\r\nshredded cabbage to this, and let all simmer together for fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLED RED CABBAGE\r\n\r\nChop or shred enough cabbage to make 2 quarts (8 cups) and add to it 1\r\nlarge onion chopped fine and 1 tablespoon of salt; mix well together\r\nand let stand over night in a covered jar. Next day press through\r\na colander to drain, and then place a layer of cabbage in a jar,\r\nsprinkle over it a few mustard seeds and 2 or 3 cloves, and proceed\r\nin this way until the cabbage is all used. Do not press down. Cover\r\nwith cider vinegar, and use any time after twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED CARROTS\r\n\r\nScrape and wash enough carrots to make 4 cups when cut in dice,\r\nand put them in a double boiler containing half milk and half water\r\nat boiling point. Let them cook slowly for forty minutes or until\r\ntender, then drain them and put them in a hot dish at the side of\r\nthe stove. Use 1 cup of the stock they cooked in to make a sauce,\r\nwith 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 of flour, and plenty of salt and\r\npepper. Pour the sauce over them to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED CARROTS AND POTATOES\r\n\r\nTo 1 quart of cold boiled potatoes, cut in dice, add 1 cup of boiled\r\ndiced carrots. Put them in a double boiler and cover with 1 1/2 cups\r\nof highly seasoned white sauce, to which has been added 1 tablespoon\r\nof onion juice and 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley; let boil\r\nup once and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROTS SAUTÉ\r\n\r\nUse boiled carrots cut in dice or fancy shapes and toss them for\r\nfive minutes in hot butter. Season with salt and pepper, add a little\r\nchopped parsley, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\nFancy shaped German carrots in glass bottles can be used instead of\r\nfresh ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLORIFIED CARROTS\r\n\r\nTake 2 cups of diced carrots and boil them in slightly sweetened\r\nwater about half an hour, or until tender, and let them cool. Put 1\r\ntablespoon of butter into a saucepan, add to it 1 teaspoon of grated\r\nonion, and toss together until hot; then add the diced carrots and 1\r\ncup of well-made white sauce. Butter small individual gratin dishes,\r\nfill them with the carrot mixture, sprinkle the top with a few lightly\r\nbrowned bread crumbs, then with chopped chives, and set in a hot oven\r\nfor five minutes. Serve alone as an entrée, placing each dish on a\r\nsmall plate with a paper doily.\r\n\r\nThis dish can be varied by using more chives mixed with the carrots\r\nand omitting the onion, or, if chives are not at hand, they can be\r\nomitted when the onion is used, and finely chopped parsley substituted\r\nto garnish the top.\r\n\r\nThe quantities given here can be doubled, and the carrots cooked in\r\na large baking dish as an addition to the main course of a luncheon\r\nor dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLAZED CARROTS\r\n\r\nFor this, the carrots must be cut into even cones or ovals, and it\r\nis convenient to use the imported carrots in glass bottles. If these\r\nare used they are already boiled; if fresh carrots are used scrape\r\nand wash them and cut out the little shapes with a patent cutter,\r\nthen boil slowly until tender, but not quite done, and put 2 or 3 cups\r\nof them in a frying pan with 2 tablespoons of butter, which has been\r\nmelted, sprinkle with fine sugar, and stir over a hot fire until they\r\nbegin to brown; then add 2 tablespoons of the stock they boiled in,\r\ncontinue to stir them, add more stock if needed, and continue stirring\r\nuntil the carrots are nicely glazed. Serve alone or as a garnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROTS DELMONICO\r\n\r\nScrape and cut in dice enough carrots to fill a small baking dish;\r\ncover with boiling water in which is 1 tablespoon of sugar, and\r\n1 tablespoon of butter, and let cook for half an hour, or until\r\ntender. Drain and let them cool, and then arrange them in the baking\r\ndish with the following sauce: Melt 3 tablespoons of butter, add 3\r\ntablespoons of flour, and when this is smooth stir into it, using a\r\nlittle at a time, 1 cup of the stock in which the carrots were cooked,\r\n1/2 cup of cream or milk containing the beaten yolks of 2 eggs;\r\nwhen smooth add 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice, and salt and pepper\r\nwell. Sprinkle the top with finely rolled crumbs and let brown in\r\nthe oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROT SOUFFLÉ\r\n\r\nMix 2 cups of boiled, mashed carrots, 2 tablespoons of chopped onion,\r\nfried for five minutes in 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 cup of milk\r\nor cream in which 3 egg-yolks are beaten, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg,\r\nsalt and pepper, and when well blended add lightly with a fork the\r\nstiffly beaten whites of the 3 eggs. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and\r\nbake to brown about fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER\r\n\r\nLeave all the green that looks fresh and palatable on the cauliflower,\r\nand wash it and let it stand from fifteen minutes to half an hour in\r\nsalted water. Then put it in a saucepan, stem downwards, with the\r\ntop barely covered with boiling water, and, if the saucepan is not\r\ntoo large, it will keep the cauliflower upright, so that the delicate\r\ntop will not cook to pieces before the green stalk is tender. A small\r\ncauliflower will take half an hour to cook, and the lower part can\r\nbe tried with a fork to see when it is tender. Leave the saucepan\r\nuncovered in cooking cauliflower, and the odour from the cooking will\r\nbe very much lessened and the cauliflower more delicate in taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED CAULIFLOWER\r\n\r\nBoil and drain a cauliflower and serve over it 1 cup of white sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN\r\n\r\nBoil a large cauliflower, drain it, and break the sprays apart. Arrange\r\nin layers in a buttered baking dish, sprinkling each layer with cheese,\r\nand seasoning it with pepper and salt. When the dish is filled pour\r\non 1 cup of white sauce, sprinkle the top with crumbs and cheese,\r\nand let bake fifteen minutes to brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER IN A GERMAN WAY\r\n\r\nBoil a cauliflower and drain it, dredge with salt and pepper, and\r\ncover the white part with melted butter, and then dust this with\r\nbrowned bread crumbs; pour 3/4 of a cup of Dutch butter over it,\r\nand let it heat for five minutes in the oven in the shallow gratin\r\ndish in which it should be served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN CAULIFLOWER\r\n\r\nBoil and drain a cauliflower and dredge the top with pepper and salt,\r\nsprinkle with grated cheese, and pour a little melted butter over\r\nit. Set in the oven for five minutes to brown, and serve surrounded\r\nwith tomato sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER FRITTERS\r\n\r\nBoil a cauliflower for twenty-five minutes, or until nearly tender,\r\nthen drain it and let it cool. When cold separate the sprays and\r\ndredge with salt and pepper, then dip in batter, and fry in deep fat\r\nuntil a golden brown. Drain and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED CELERY\r\n\r\nScrape and trim 3 or 4 heads of celery, leaving the roots on\r\nand cutting the tops off; cut each stalk in half, lengthwise,\r\nand into pieces five inches long; wash carefully in running water,\r\nand then blanch in boiling water for ten minutes. Drain and tie the\r\nstalks together like bunches of asparagus, and put them in a saucepan\r\ncontaining 2 cups of water, 2 cups of milk, 1/2 a carrot, 1/2 an onion\r\nwith 2 cloves stuck in it, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 scant saltspoon\r\nof pepper, and let simmer three quarters of an hour or more, or until\r\nquite tender when tried with a fork. Remove the celery, strain the\r\nstock, and use 1 cup of it in making a sauce, with 1 tablespoon of\r\nbutter and 1 tablespoon of flour. Untie the bunches of celery, and\r\narrange them evenly on toast with the sauce poured over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY IN BROWN SAUCE\r\n\r\nPrepare celery as above, boil for three quarters of an hour or\r\nuntil tender, drain, and cover with the brown sauce described below,\r\nomitting the wine, and serve in an ordinary vegetable dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY IN CASSEROLE\r\n\r\nCut celery in four-inch lengths, halving each stalk lengthwise,\r\nand leaving the root on, wash well and parboil for ten minutes in\r\nsalted water or milk, and arrange in a square, covered casserole. Put 2\r\ntablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when browned add 2 tablespoons\r\nof flour. Stir until well dissolved, then add 2 cups of the water in\r\nwhich the celery cooked, 1 scant teaspoon of salt, 1 small saltspoon\r\nof pepper, and 2 bay leaves. Stir until smooth, and then strain and\r\npour this sauce over the celery, add 1 teaspoon of sherry or Madeira,\r\ncover the dish, set it in a shallow pan containing a little water,\r\nand let it cook for half an hour in the oven. Serve in the casserole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED CELERY\r\n\r\nCut 2 bunches of celery into two-inch lengths, wash thoroughly, and\r\nlet blanch in boiling water and milk, using equal quantities of each,\r\nfor fifteen minutes, then remove the celery and let it cool; add to\r\n1 cup of the milk and water stock 1 tablespoon of butter blended with\r\n1 tablespoon of flour, some pepper and salt, and when smoothed remove\r\nfrom the fire and beat into it vigorously 2 eggs. Arrange the celery\r\nin a buttered baking dish, pour the sauce over it, spread the top\r\nthickly with crumbs, and put in the oven. Cover for twenty minutes,\r\nthen uncover and let brown nicely before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCÊPES IN BLACK BUTTER\r\n\r\nFrench Cêpes come in tin or glass. Put 3 tablespoons of butter in\r\na pan, with 2 bay leaves, a few celery seeds and 1 clove of garlic;\r\nlet it slowly brown. Strain and add cêpes and let them heat in the\r\nbutter. Season with salt and paprika and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SWEET CORN\r\n\r\nSweet corn on the cob, which has been picked within twenty-four\r\nhours of the time of using, should be dropped into rapidly boiling,\r\nslightly salted water, and boiled not more than eight or ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST CORN\r\n\r\nTo roast sweet corn, leave the husks on the cob, and put in a slow oven\r\nand let bake for half an hour. Take off the husks and silk and serve at\r\nonce. Some think this method of cooking the delicate American vegetable\r\nretains the flavour of the corn more than the usual way of boiling it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN PUDDING\r\n\r\nUse 6 or 7 ears of sweet corn, and cut each row down the middle with\r\na sharp knife, and then cut the grains from the ear, and add to them 2\r\ncups of milk, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of\r\nsugar, 1 tablespoon of melted butter, and 2 slightly beaten eggs. Put\r\nthis into a baking dish and bake like a custard, in a slow oven for\r\nhalf an hour, taking care it does not cook too long nor get too hot\r\nlest it curdle. Canned corn may be used when fresh is out of season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN PUDDING IN TOMATO OR PEPPER CASES\r\n\r\nBake the preceding in cases made by scooping a large part of the inside\r\nfrom large, solid tomatoes, or in hollowed-out green, sweet peppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN CREOLE\r\n\r\nPut 1 can of corn into a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of chopped\r\ngreen peppers and 1/2 cup of milk, and cook slowly for ten minutes;\r\nthen season with salt and pepper and add 1 tablespoon of butter\r\nand serve. This may be put in a baking dish, covered with crumbs,\r\nand baked for fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN AND TOMATO PIE\r\n\r\nButter a pudding dish and fill it with alternate layers of boiled or\r\ncanned corn and tomatoes, and season with salt, pepper, and butter;\r\ncover the top with pie-crust and bake in a moderately hot oven for\r\nfifteen minutes. If a crust is not desired the dish can be covered\r\nwith bread crumbs and browned. If fresh tomatoes and corn are used\r\nthe pie will require twice the time to cook, the first half of the\r\ntime covered with a plate, and the last half uncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN CHOWDER\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1\r\nsliced onion, and let cook slowly for five minutes; then add to it\r\n4 cups of potatoes which have been parboiled for five minutes, and\r\nthen cut in small squares, and 2 cups of boiling water. Let cook for\r\ntwenty minutes or until the potatoes are tender, then add 1 can of\r\nsweet corn, 4 cups of hot milk, 1 tablespoon of butter, and plenty\r\nof salt and pepper, and let heat through. Break 8 soda crackers into\r\na deep dish, and pour the chowder over them to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND ESCALLOP\r\n\r\nBake 4 medium-sized sweet potatoes for half an hour, then scrape out\r\nthe potato and chop it into small bits. Boil 2 ears of green corn\r\nfor ten minutes, run a sharp knife down each row of grains, cutting\r\nthem in two, and then cut the corn from the cob and mix it with the\r\nchopped sweet potato. Butter six individual gratin dishes and fill\r\nthem with the mixed corn and potato, sprinkle them with salt, pour\r\n1 tablespoon of melted butter over each, cover with bread crumbs,\r\nand let cook for eight or ten minutes in the oven. The same mixture\r\ncan be used to fill a baking dish, and enough melted butter used to\r\nmoisten the potato thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED CUCUMBERS\r\n\r\nPeel 4 or 5 cucumbers, quarter them, and cover them with boiling\r\nsalted water, and let them cook from twenty to thirty minutes; then\r\ndrain, saving the water in which they were cooked. Make a sauce of\r\n2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of flour rubbed together,\r\nand 2 cups of the water in which the cucumbers were boiled, stir until\r\nsmooth, and when it boils add the juice of 1 lemon, 1 teaspoon of salt,\r\nand some paprika; arrange the cucumbers on slices of toast and serve\r\nwith the sauce poured over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUFFED CUCUMBERS\r\n\r\nPeel the cucumbers and cut into pieces about two inches long, scoop out\r\nthe centre of each piece about half-way down to form a cup, fill this\r\nwith chopped onions and chopped mushrooms that have been fried together\r\nin butter, cover the tops with crumbs, and let brown in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED EGG-PLANT WITH SAUCE TARTARE\r\n\r\nPeel and cut an egg-plant into half-inch slices, dust quickly with salt\r\nand pepper, roll in beaten egg-yolk, then in fine bread crumbs, and fry\r\nin hot vegetable fat; drain on brown paper and serve very hot. Either\r\nserve sauce Tartare with this, or arrange a spoonful on each round of\r\negg-plant. Garnish with sprigs of watercress, celery tops, or parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED EGG-PLANT WITH TOMATO SAUCE\r\n\r\nFry as in foregoing recipe and serve a savoury tomato sauce with the\r\negg-plant. Never soak egg-plant in salt and water, as it takes away\r\nits crispness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED ENDIVE\r\n\r\nCut the outside leaves from heads of endive, and wash the endive\r\nthoroughly; then drain and put in boiling salted water for fifteen\r\nminutes. Drain again and cover with cold water for a few minutes, then\r\nchop and put in a saucepan with some butter, allowing 1 tablespoon\r\nfor each head of endive, cover and let cook slowly for ten minutes,\r\nsalt well, moisten with cream and sprinkle with paprika, and serve\r\non toast or garnished with triangular pieces of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKOHLRABI\r\n\r\nThese are very nice if used young, when not much larger than an\r\negg. Parboil them for half an hour, cut them in half, and put them\r\nin a frying pan containing melted butter, and fry for fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes. Serve over them the butter in which they were cooked,\r\nand dredge with salt and pepper. The time required to cook kohlrabi\r\ndepends largely of course upon the age at which it is picked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKOHLRABI AU GRATIN\r\n\r\nSlice kohlrabi, boil twenty minutes or until nearly tender, and arrange\r\nin a baking dish in layers with cream sauce. Season each layer with\r\npepper and salt, sprinkle the top with crumbs and grated cheese,\r\nand bake twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLENTIL PIE\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add to\r\nit 1 finely chopped onion and let this fry slowly for ten minutes;\r\nthen add 2 cups of boiled German or Egyptian lentils and 1/2 cup of\r\nbrown or German sauce, and when heated through pile into a deep dish;\r\ndredge with pepper and salt, cover with pie-crust, and bake in the\r\noven until brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLENTILS EGYPTIAN STYLE\r\n\r\nWash 2 cups of lentils, soak them two or three hours, and drain them\r\nbefore using. Put them into boiling water well salted, cook until\r\ntender, about forty minutes, then drain again. Put 2 tablespoons of\r\nbutter into a saucepan, and when melted add 1 large onion finely\r\nchopped; cook over a very slow fire for ten minutes, then add the\r\nlentils and 2 scant cups of boiled rice, and stir all together with\r\na large fork until very hot; dredge well with salt and pepper before\r\nserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN LENTILS\r\n\r\nCover 2 cups of lentils with cold water and let them soak two or three\r\nhours; drain them and put them in boiling salted water with 1 leek\r\n(or 1 onion) and let them cook half an hour, or until tender but not\r\nbroken. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when melted\r\nstir into it 2 tablespoons of flour, and let brown; then add 2 finely\r\nchopped onions and 2 or 3 tablespoons of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of\r\nthe water in which the lentils cooked. Mix this sauce with the drained\r\nlentils, put them in a double boiler with salt, pepper, and a dash of\r\nnutmeg, and serve after they have steamed slowly for fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEEKS\r\n\r\nCut leeks into three-inch lengths, using the tender green part as\r\nwell as the white; wash the pieces thoroughly in cold running water,\r\nthen put them in a small saucepan and cover them with boiling salted\r\nwater, and let them boil for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nMake a sauce by melting 1 tablespoon of butter and thickening it\r\nwith 1 tablespoon of flour, and then adding, 1 tablespoon at a time,\r\nenough of the water the leeks were cooked in (about 1 cup) to make\r\nthe sauce of the right consistency; season with pepper and salt,\r\ndrain the leeks, and serve the sauce over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nMushrooms should only be used when perfectly fresh and firm; in\r\npeeling them take a small knife, and, holding the delicate fringe at\r\nthe edge of the mushroom between the edge of the knife and the thumb,\r\npeel the paper-like skin off, pulling it toward the centre of the\r\nmushroom. The stems should be cut or broken off without breaking the\r\ncup, and if sound should be scraped and used. When the mushrooms are\r\nwhite and small and freshly picked they can be quickly washed and\r\nused without peeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nPeel about 1 pound of mushrooms, put them in a saucepan with 2\r\ntablespoons of butter, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt,\r\nand 1/4 cup of milk, into which 1 tablespoon of flour has been mixed;\r\ncover and let cook for five or six minutes, then add 1 cup of cream,\r\nstir all well together, replace the cover, and let cook gently for\r\nten minutes. These mushrooms can also be cooked and served in an\r\nItalian casserole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN STEWED MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nPeel 1 pound of mushrooms and put them in a saucepan, sprinkle with the\r\njuice of 1 lemon, add 1 cup of milk, cover, and let simmer gently for\r\nten minutes. Thicken with 1 heaping teaspoon of flour dissolved in a\r\nlittle milk, and add 1 tablespoon of butter and a grating of nutmeg,\r\nand let simmer gently for ten minutes more before serving. Instead\r\nof lemon juice and milk a cup of sour cream is often used in Germany,\r\nand is an acceptable substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM AND CHESTNUT RAGOUT\r\n\r\nUse an equal quantity of peeled mushrooms and boiled Italian chestnuts,\r\nand heat in a rich brown sauce. Serve, garnished with toast, or in\r\ncases, or use in a deep pie with a top crust of biscuit dough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS NEWBURG\r\n\r\nPeel 1 pound of mushrooms, cover them with 2 cups of milk, and let\r\nthem simmer gently for ten minutes. Lift the mushrooms out with a\r\nstrainer, and make a sauce of the milk by adding 1 tablespoon of flour,\r\n1 tablespoon of butter, the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, 1 wineglass of\r\nsherry, and some salt and paprika. When the sauce thickens replace\r\nthe mushrooms in it, let them heat for two minutes, and serve on\r\ntoast or in patty cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST\r\n\r\nSelect as many large mushrooms as are required, and, after peeling\r\nthem, lay each one, cup upward, on rounds of toast which, after\r\ntoasting, have been dampened by being plunged quickly into hot water;\r\nplace the toast with the mushrooms upon it into a shallow buttered\r\npan, put a little bit of butter in the cup of each mushroom, sprinkle\r\nwith salt and pepper, cover with another pan the same size, and let\r\ncook eight or ten minutes. Serve at once, with a garnish of parsley\r\nor watercress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRILLED MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nPeel or wash the mushrooms, and put them, cup upward, on a fine wire\r\nbroiler and let them broil over a hot fire for five or six minutes,\r\nputting a pinch of salt in each cup. As soon as hot, remove them from\r\nthe broiler and serve on hot plates, taking care not to spill the\r\njuice which has formed in the cups. Garnish with watercress or parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS SUR CLOCHE\r\n\r\nPlace carefully cleaned mushrooms, cup upward, on individual gratin\r\ndishes, salt each, and place a bit of butter in the cup, and set in a\r\nhot oven for ten minutes. To serve, place over each a glass \"bell,\"\r\nwhich can be bought for this purpose. The heat is thus retained in\r\nthe mushrooms during service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS IN CASSEROLE\r\n\r\nPut into a French or Italian casserole 1/2 cup of good butter, and when\r\nmelted stir into it 3/4 of a pound, or a pound, of peeled mushrooms,\r\nand dredge well with pepper and salt. Cover the casserole and set it\r\nin the oven; after five minutes' cooking stir the mushrooms, mixing\r\nthem well with the butter, replace the cover, and repeat the process\r\nin another five minutes; let cook ten minutes more, and serve from\r\nthe casserole on rounds of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFILLED MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nSelect 10 of the largest, most cup-shaped from 1 1/2 pounds of\r\nmushrooms. Peel and lay in a shallow pan, cup side up. Take the cleaned\r\nstems and the remaining mushrooms and chop fine and put them in the\r\ncups; add 1 teaspoon of melted butter, some pepper and salt to each,\r\nand let bake ten minutes or until done. Serve on toast garnished with\r\nwatercress, or under the glass bells already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS WITH TRUFFLES\r\n\r\nToss truffles in butter in a hot frying pan for five minutes,\r\nsprinkle the cups of mushrooms with pepper and salt, fill them with\r\nthe truffles, and cook for ten minutes in a covered pan in a hot oven;\r\nserve on crisp lettuce leaves, with parsley butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS WITH PEAS\r\n\r\nFill the cups of large mushrooms with French canned peas, which\r\nhave been tossed for five minutes in hot butter. Season and set in\r\na covered pan in a hot oven for ten minutes, and serve on toast with\r\nwhite or brown sauce, as preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS WITH ONIONS\r\n\r\nPeel 2 medium-sized onions and chop them fine, and put them in a\r\ncasserole, or saucepan, with 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Let them\r\ncook slowly for ten minutes, then add 1 pound of mushrooms, which have\r\nbeen carefully washed or peeled, and another tablespoon of butter,\r\nand cover, letting cook for ten minutes. Season well with salt and\r\npepper and serve very hot.\r\n\r\nMushrooms thus prepared may be put in a deep baking dish, covered\r\nwith crust and baked in a pie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS WITH EGG\r\n\r\nPut 2 tablespoons of butter in a porcelain casserole, or in a saucepan,\r\nand when melted put with it 1 pound of peeled or washed mushrooms;\r\nlet simmer gently for ten minutes, then add to them 2 hard-boiled\r\neggs, cut in slices, and half a cup of cream. This recipe also is\r\navailable for a deep pie; put in a baking dish, cover with crust,\r\nand bake until slightly browned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nDrain the mushrooms from 1 can, and cut them in half. Use the liquid\r\nfrom the can augmented with water, if necessary, to make brown or\r\nGerman sauce. Put the mushrooms in a saucepan with the sauce, season\r\nwith pepper and salt, and serve very hot on toast.\r\n\r\nButton mushrooms can also be cooked by simply draining and tossing\r\nin parsley butter until hot; season with salt and pepper and serve\r\non toast.\r\n\r\nMushrooms cooked in these ways are suitable for filling peppers\r\nor tomatoes. Canned mushrooms can be bought which are put up with\r\ntruffles, and add variety to these different dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED MUSHROOMS CZARINA\r\n\r\nOpen a can of button mushrooms, drain them, and cut the buttons in\r\nhalf, if very large, and reserve the liquid. Put 1 tablespoon of butter\r\nin a saucepan, and when melted add 1 tablespoon of grated onion, 2 bay\r\nleaves, 2 cloves, 2 peppercorns, and 2 allspice. Let all cook together\r\nslowly for five minutes, then pour on the liquid from the mushrooms,\r\nwith enough milk added to make 2 cups, season with salt, and let\r\nsimmer for ten minutes; then add 1 tablespoon of flour creamed with 1\r\ntablespoon of butter, let boil up once, and strain. Put the sauce and\r\nthe button mushrooms in an Italian casserole, set this in the oven to\r\nheat for five minutes, and serve from the dish on triangles of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM LOAF\r\n\r\nPour good clear, well-strained boiling vegetable stock onto dissolved\r\nvegetable gelatine or arrowroot, using about 1 tablespoon to every\r\n2 cups of liquid. Season well with salt and pepper, and add 1 can\r\nof button mushrooms, halved, when the jelly is somewhat set so that\r\nthey will remain in place evenly dispersed. Line a mould with chopped\r\nparsley and slices of pickled walnuts, pour the jelly into it, and\r\nserve, when set, ice-cold, with any savoury cold sauce or pickles. A\r\nfew chopped nuts may be added if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED OKRA\r\n\r\nCut the ends off the pods of young okra, boil for one hour in salted\r\nwater, then drain and reheat in a saucepan with some melted butter.\r\n\r\nThe okra can be used as a garnish to boiled rice. Canned okra needs\r\nonly to be boiled five minutes, drained, seasoned, and tossed about\r\nin hot butter in a frying pan for two or three minutes before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOKRA AND GRILLED TOMATOES\r\n\r\nCut good firm tomatoes in half, season well and broil, then serve\r\nwith a garnish of stewed okra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED OKRA WITH TOMATO SAUCE\r\n\r\nIf fresh okra is used prepare as in stewed okra recipe, and if\r\ncanned okra is used drain and heat in boiling salted water. Put 1\r\ntablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted lift the okra\r\nfrom the boiling water and place it in the frying pan; season well\r\nwith salt and pepper and then cover with 1 cup of tomato sauce, and,\r\nwhen thoroughly heated through, serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOKRA AND TOMATO ESCALLOP\r\n\r\nArrange alternate layers of sliced canned okra and tomato in a well\r\nbuttered baking dish, separating them with layers of boiled rice\r\nwell seasoned with salt and pepper and dotted with butter. Cover the\r\ntop with fine crumbs and cook for fifteen minutes, or until browned,\r\nin the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED ONIONS\r\n\r\nPeel onions under cold water and they will not bring tears to the\r\neyes. They should then be put in rapidly boiling water, and this\r\nchanged after the first five minutes of cooking; then put in fresh\r\nboiling water, salt added, and cooked for from half an hour to forty\r\nminutes. If onions are not covered when boiling the odour will be\r\nless noticeable.\r\n\r\nServe boiled onions with parsley butter, or, after draining, cover\r\nwith milk, add butter, pepper, and salt, and let boil up once before\r\nserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED ONIONS\r\n\r\nUse onions which have been boiled until tender but not broken, and,\r\nafter draining, serve with white or parsley sauce, made with equal\r\nquantities of milk and the stock in which the onions cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED ONIONS WITH BROWN SAUCE\r\n\r\nServe small boiled onions, which have cooked until tender, but not\r\nbroken, with any hot sauce,--tomato, brown, mushroom, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONIONS AU GRATIN\r\n\r\nPrepare as for creamed onions, making a white sauce of the milk, or\r\nmilk and water, in which the onions have been boiled. The onions can\r\nbe left whole, or somewhat broken up in the sauce. Fill a buttered\r\nbaking dish with onions and sauce, dust the top with grated cheese,\r\nand let heat in the oven five or six minutes. The bottled Parmesan\r\ncheese is convenient, but is never as delicate to the taste as fresh\r\ncheese grated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONIONS WITH CHEESE\r\n\r\nArrange boiled onions, which are not broken at all by boiling, in a\r\nbuttered baking dish, baste well with melted butter, and dredge with\r\ngrated cheese, and set in the oven a few moments to brown; serve in\r\nthe same dish or remove to a small platter and garnish with green,\r\nor use as a garnish to a dish of other vegetables. Mashed potatoes\r\npiled high (browned on top with salamander or under flame in gas oven)\r\nsurrounded with these onions makes an attractive dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCALLOPED ONIONS\r\n\r\nEscalloped onions are made like Onions au Gratin, except that the\r\ncheese is omitted and replaced by a layer of fine bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED ONIONS WITH CHESTNUTS\r\n\r\nPeel as many onions as required and parboil them for ten or fifteen\r\nminutes in salted water. Drain and dry, and when cooled somewhat\r\nremove the inside and fill with chopped chestnuts which have been\r\ntossed in hot butter for fifteen minutes; season well with salt and\r\npepper, and, if liked, a little sage; arrange in a buttered baking\r\ndish, and bake for half an hour, covering them for the first fifteen\r\nminutes. If they seem too dry, baste with a little cream or onion\r\nstock and melted butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONION SOUFFLÉ\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1\r\ntablespoon of flour, stir until smooth, and then add gradually 1 cup of\r\nmilk, and season with paprika and salt. Let boil, then add 1/2 cup of\r\nstale bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, 1 1/2 cups of cold\r\nboiled onions chopped fine, and the yolks of 2 eggs well beaten. Mix\r\nthoroughly, then add the stiffly beaten whites of the 2 eggs, and mix\r\nthem gently through the onion mixture with a fork. Put in a buttered\r\nbaking dish, or in individual cases, sprinkle fine crumbs on top,\r\nand bake about fifteen minutes to slightly brown before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDEAUX ONIONS\r\n\r\nPeel 6 or 8 small onions, and parboil them for fifteen minutes\r\nin salted water. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan or a\r\nbaking dish, with 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley and 1 tablespoon\r\nof chopped celery, 2 cloves, 1 bay leaf, 1/4 of a cup of claret,\r\n1 cup of brown sauce, the juice of 1 lemon, pepper and salt. Set the\r\nonions in this, cover, and let cook very gently for half an hour or\r\nuntil tender. Remove the bay leaf and serve with the sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONION AND TOMATO ESCALLOP\r\n\r\nPlace alternate layers of fresh onions, sliced, and fresh tomatoes\r\nin a buttered baking dish, covering each layer with crumbs, butter,\r\npepper and salt. Put 1 1/2 cups of water over and bake for about\r\nan hour in a slow oven. Or use boiled onions and canned tomatoes,\r\ndampen with the juice from the tomatoes, and cook twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONIONS BEATRICE\r\n\r\nFill a large bean-pot (or a high earthenware covered jar marmite)\r\nwith small Bermuda onions, two inches in diameter. The onions should\r\nbe left whole, but a sharp knife can be used to make two cuts in\r\nthe shape of a cross in the top of each, as this insures the cooking\r\nof the centre. While arranging the onions in the jar, sprinkle them\r\nwell with salt, also with black pepper (or use 1/2 dozen peppercorns\r\ninstead), put in 3 bay leaves, and distribute 1 teaspoon of mixed\r\nherbs. Cover with hot water, put the lid on, and set on the back of\r\nthe stove or in a slow oven. The onions should not cook to pieces,\r\nand with the proper heat will be cooked through in about two hours;\r\nthis time is named not as a rule but as a guide. Serve in the marmite\r\nin which they were cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUFFED ONIONS\r\n\r\nBoil the onions fifteen or twenty minutes and then remove the hearts,\r\nleaving the outsides as cases for a filling. Make the stuffing of bread\r\nor cracker crumbs mixed with the chopped centres of the onions, plenty\r\nof salt and pepper, and a little chopped tomato (or tomato sauce), or\r\nsome chopped green peppers, or canned pimentos, or use both tomato and\r\npeppers. Fill the onion cases, and arrange in a buttered baking dish;\r\nsprinkle with 2 tablespoons of melted butter, set the pan in water,\r\nand bake half an hour; the baking dish should be covered until the\r\nlast five minutes, and the onions should not be allowed to go dry;\r\nmore butter can be added, or a little hot water or vegetable broth,\r\nif they cook dry. Serve in the baking dish, or remove to a small\r\nplatter and garnish with sprigs of parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED ONIONS\r\n\r\nPeel the onions and cut into thin slices, and when a generous\r\ntablespoon of butter has slowly melted in a frying pan, put the\r\nonions in and let them simmer over as low a fire as will keep them\r\ncooking; stir them frequently and serve when transparent and turning\r\na golden brown.\r\n\r\nFried onions can be served alone or as a garnish to heaped up\r\nmashed potatoes. They are saved from their extreme commonplaceness\r\nby being arranged in a gratin dish, not over an inch high, dusted\r\nwith a sprinkling of crumbs or grated cheese, and given three or four\r\nminutes in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH FRIED ONIONS\r\n\r\nPeel medium-sized onions, and slice crosswise carefully; then separate\r\nthe slices into rings. Drop these into smoking vegetable fat or oil,\r\nand let fry four or five minutes until crisp and a rich brown. Lift\r\nwith a strainer onto brown paper to drain a moment before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONIONS IN POTATO CRADLES\r\n\r\nMake potato cradles as directed, dredge with salt, and fill with\r\nfried or French-fried onions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL ONIONS\r\n\r\nPeel small, round, pickling onions, parboil them ten minutes, drain,\r\nroll in flour, and fry in deep fat. Serve as a garnish to other\r\nvegetables or in stews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLAZED ONIONS\r\n\r\nThese are nice used either as a garnish to another dish (vegetable\r\ncroquettes, mashed potatoes, etc.) or alone. Small onions should\r\nbe used, or onion hearts, and taken from the water before they are\r\nquite cooked; then put in an enamelled pan in which is 1 tablespoon\r\nof butter which has been slowly melted; toss them about in this,\r\nand sprinkle with powdered sugar. When they begin to brown add 1\r\ntablespoon of the water in which they were boiled, and as this is\r\ntaken up add a little more, and pepper and salt. The onions will be\r\nbrowned and glazed. Serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONIONS AND APPLES\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted put in\r\n3 sliced onions and 3 sliced apples; let fry slowly until browned,\r\nand serve on toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED PARSNIPS IN SAUCE\r\n\r\nWash and scrape 6 or 7 parsnips, cut them in half, lengthwise, and\r\nput them in cold water for half an hour. Drain them, and put them\r\nin a saucepan of boiling water containing 1 teaspoon of salt, and\r\nlet them boil for about three quarters of an hour. While they are\r\nfinishing cooking, prepare a sauce with 1 tablespoon of butter and\r\n1 tablespoon of flour rubbed together, and put in a saucepan over a\r\nslow fire. When melted and smooth add, a spoonful at a time, some of\r\nthe stock in which the parsnips are cooking, until about 2 cups have\r\nbeen used; stir until well thickened but not paste-like, season with\r\nsalt and pepper, and pour over the parsnips after draining them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSNIPS IN BUTTER\r\n\r\nScrape and wash the parsnips, and cut them in eighths, lengthwise,\r\nand then in half. Put them in boiling water, salt well, and let them\r\ncook for about three quarters of an hour. Drain and serve with 1/2\r\ncup melted butter poured over them, which contains 1 tablespoon of\r\nchopped parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED PARSNIPS\r\n\r\nSlice cold boiled parsnips lengthwise, dredge with salt, and fry\r\nin buttered pan or griddle until a golden brown, turning with a\r\npancake turner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH FRIED PARSNIPS\r\n\r\nUse cold boiled parsnips, cut in any shape desired,--balls, or long\r\nstrips,--and put them in a frying basket, and fry in hot fat until\r\nbrown. Drain, and dredge with salt to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED PARSNIPS\r\n\r\nUse boiled parsnips, cut each in 3 slices, lengthwise, dip in melted\r\nbutter, broil until brown, and sprinkle with salt before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN PEAS\r\n\r\nNewly picked green peas should be shelled and put in a double-boiler\r\nwith a little salt, and 1 teaspoon or more of sugar, and no\r\nwater. Cover closely and keep water in under pan boiling for about\r\nthree quarters of an hour. Add a little butter before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN PEAS PAYSANNE\r\n\r\nCook peas as in the above recipe adding a few lettuce leaves which\r\nhave been washed and cut in strips. Drain them before adding butter\r\nand salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED PEAS\r\n\r\nCanned peas should be slowly cooked in their own stock for ten minutes,\r\ndrained, and seasoned with butter, pepper and salt, and a little milk\r\nor cream added to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED PEAS WITH ONION\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1\r\ntablespoon of chopped onion; let simmer for five minutes, then add\r\n1 can of peas, drained of their juice, and 1/4 of a cup of cream or\r\nmilk; season well with salt and pepper, and serve after ten minutes'\r\nslow cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUFFED PEPPERS\r\n\r\nSlice the stem-end from sweet peppers, cut out the insides, and fill\r\nwith a mixture made of 1 cup of fine crumbs, 1 grated onion, 1/2 cup\r\nof chopped nuts, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 2 tablespoons of melted\r\nbutter. Set in a pan containing a little water and melted butter,\r\nand bake from twenty minutes to half an hour, basting occasionally.\r\n\r\nPeppers can be parboiled for ten minutes before stuffing, but though\r\nsofter they lose their colour to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPERS STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nCut the stem-end from sweet peppers, remove the inside, and fill with\r\nmushrooms Czarina, or mushrooms in tomato sauce, and bake twenty to\r\nthirty minutes, basting with a little butter and water, which should\r\nbe in the pan in which they are cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPERS WITH RICE\r\n\r\nCut the stem-end from sweet green peppers, remove the inside, fill\r\nwith boiled rice and chopped tomato in equal proportions, and season\r\nwell with pepper and salt. A few chopped mushrooms, olives, or boiled\r\neggs may be added to the filling. Bake from twenty to thirty minutes,\r\nbasting with butter and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN PEPPERS WITH EGG\r\n\r\nParboil 6 green peppers for five minutes, first having cut off the\r\nstem-end and removed the seeds. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a\r\nfrying pan, and when melted add 1 finely chopped onion, and let it\r\ncook slowly for ten minutes; then stir in 3 tablespoons of fine bread\r\ncrumbs, and season with salt, pepper, and catsup. Upon removing the\r\npeppers from the boiling water set them up cup-like in a shallow pan,\r\nand put 1 tablespoon of this mixture into each; break into each pepper\r\n1 egg, cover with some more of the prepared crumbs, and bake for ten\r\nminutes if the eggs are liked soft, for fifteen if liked hard. Serve\r\non toast with 1 1/2 cups of white sauce containing 2 tablespoons of\r\ngrated cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPERS WITH CORN\r\n\r\nCut a slice from the end of sweet peppers, remove the inside, and\r\nfill with canned corn, well salted; replace the ends and bake.\r\n\r\nPeppers, like tomatoes, may be filled in so many ways that it is\r\nuseless to endeavour to enumerate them, for the ingenious cook can\r\nmultiply them without end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCALLOP OF PEPPERS AND CORN\r\n\r\nCut enough sweet corn from the cob to make 3 cups. Take 2 or 3 sweet\r\ngreen peppers and remove the insides, then slice them in very thin\r\ncircles and arrange a layer of the corn in a buttered baking dish,\r\nsalt it, and then place some rings of the peppers, then another\r\nlayer of corn, and so on, until the dish is filled, finishing the\r\ntop with peppers. To a cup of cream (or milk) add 1 beaten egg and 2\r\ntablespoons of melted butter; pour this over the whole, and bake for\r\nhalf an hour in a hot oven. Canned corn may be used, in which case\r\nless cream will be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED PEPPERS\r\n\r\nRemove the seeds from 6 sweet green peppers, cut the pods in squares\r\nabout half an inch across. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan,\r\nand when melted add 1 sliced onion, and let simmer for two or three\r\nminutes; then put into the pan the cut-up peppers, and fry for ten\r\nminutes. Add 1/2 cup of brown or tomato sauce and serve on toast with\r\nboiled rice, or on flat rice cakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED PIMENTOS\r\n\r\nPut the pimentos from 1 can into 2 cups of white sauce, and let cook in\r\na double boiler for ten minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley,\r\nsome pepper and salt, and serve on toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLED PIMENTOS\r\n\r\nRemove the pimentos from the can, and with a sharp knife cut them\r\nopen on one side and open them out. Arrange the flat pieces thus made\r\non a large plate or board, with the inner part up, and spread with\r\nfinely chopped onion, sprinkle with salt and celery salt, and roll\r\ninto firm rolls. Place these in a well-buttered tin, add a little hot\r\nwater, cover, and set in a hot oven for ten minutes; then uncover,\r\nadd 1 tablespoon of butter, and when it melts baste the pimentos with\r\nit. Let them cook five minutes more, and serve with the melted butter\r\npoured over them, or with parsley butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIMENTOS WITH OKRA\r\n\r\nSplit the pimentos with a sharp knife, salt the inner part, then\r\nroll each around a pod of freshly boiled or canned okra. Place in a\r\nwell-buttered pan, add a little hot water, and let cook ten minutes\r\ncovered, and five uncovered. Add more butter during the last five\r\nminutes, baste the rolls, and serve with the butter poured over them,\r\nor with tomato sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIMENTOS WITH TOMATO\r\n\r\nLay the large flat pimentos from a can on a platter, and slide into\r\neach a slice of tomato which has been sprinkled with salt and celery\r\nsalt. Fry in a covered pan for five minutes, and serve plain or with\r\ncaper sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES\r\n\r\nBetween the good cooks who contend that a potato is never properly\r\n\"boiled\" if it is boiled at all, and those who either cook potatoes\r\nin a steamer, or put them in cold water which is carefully watched to\r\nsee that it does not actually boil, cooking thus until the potatoes\r\nare tender, and those who drop them into rapidly boiling salted\r\nwater, letting them boil hard until done, there is wide latitude for\r\nindividual preference. I would advise those who do not have potatoes\r\nserved on the table which are white and floury and thoroughly cooked\r\nthrough, to see that one of the above-mentioned ways of cooking\r\npotatoes is carried out in their kitchens. Potatoes put in boiling\r\nwater, or put in a covered steamer over rapidly boiling water, will\r\ncook in from twenty minutes to half an hour, the time depending, of\r\ncourse, upon the size and age of the potatoes; they should always be\r\ncarefully scrubbed and cooked in their skins, and peeled afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASHED POTATOES\r\n\r\nHaving boiled or steamed the required number of potatoes, peel them as\r\nexpeditiously as possible and break them up in a hot saucepan; mash and\r\nthen beat them vigorously with a wooden spoon or a fork, add a generous\r\npiece of butter, dredge with salt and a little pepper, and beat them\r\nuntil they are light; then moisten slightly with a very little hot\r\nmilk or cream, beat them for a moment more, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO SOUFFLÉ\r\n\r\nPut into a saucepan 3 or 4 cups of warm mashed potato and 1 tablespoon\r\nbutter. Add the yolks of 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons cream (or milk), salt\r\nand pepper, and stir over fire until well mixed. Remove from the fire\r\nand add the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Heap in a buttered baking\r\ndish and let brown on the top in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASHED POTATO SOUFFLÉ IN CASES\r\n\r\nSelect large potatoes, scrub them and let them bake until mealy, which\r\nwill be in from half an hour to three quarters, then cut them in half,\r\nlengthwise, and carefully scrape out the potato, laying aside the\r\nskins to use as cases. Mash the potatoes with a wire potato-masher,\r\nadd 1 tablespoon of butter for every 5 potatoes used, and season well\r\nwith salt and pepper. Beat the whites of eggs very stiff, allowing\r\n2 to every 5 potatoes, and mix them lightly through the potato with\r\na fork; fill the potato skins with the mixture, heaping them full;\r\nbrown them slightly in the oven before serving, and garnish the dish\r\non which they are served with sprigs of parsley. Five potatoes will\r\nfill 6 or 7 cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICED POTATOES\r\n\r\nBreak up well-boiled dry potatoes with a fork, dredge with salt and\r\npepper, and press through a sieve or a so-called \"ricer\" into a hot\r\nserving dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICED POTATO FRITTERS\r\n\r\nBoil 6 large potatoes, press them through a sieve, and add 3 lightly\r\nbeaten eggs, 2 teaspoons of flour creamed with 1 tablespoon of butter,\r\n1 teaspoon of salt, and 2 cups of milk. Beat well together, and drop\r\nfrom a large spoon into deep, hot fat; they will rise to the top a\r\nlight brown when done. Chopped chives or chopped parsley may be added\r\nto the mixture if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASHED POTATOES WITH ONION\r\n\r\nTo 4 or 5 cups of mashed potato add 1 cup of boiled onion minced to\r\na pulp, 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 tablespoon of cream, some pepper\r\nand salt; beat lightly together, and before serving brown the top\r\nfor a moment in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED POTATOES\r\n\r\nSelect potatoes of uniform size, scrub them well, place in a hot oven\r\nuntil they yield to pressure of the fingers, which will be in most\r\ncases in about three quarters of an hour. They should not stand after\r\nbaking, and should be served in an open dish. A baked potato that is\r\nworked with the fingers while being turned in the hand a few times,\r\nbecomes light and soft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST POTATOES\r\n\r\nPare small, round potatoes, and lay them in cold water. Put 2\r\ntablespoons of butter in a shallow baking pan, and let it melt in the\r\noven; then wipe the potatoes, and lay them in the pan, rolling each\r\nin the hot butter. Let them cook in a moderate oven from one half to\r\nthree quarters of an hour, and baste them during the cooking five or\r\nsix times with the butter. Sprinkle with salt before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENVER POTATOES\r\n\r\nPeel several smooth oval potatoes and cut in half, lengthwise. Dig\r\nout a small hole in the centre of the smooth side, and level the\r\nrounded parts so they will sit evenly. Put a lump of butter in each,\r\nand place in a pan with a little water, first dredging with salt and\r\npepper, and bake about twenty-five minutes or until browned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED POTATOES\r\n\r\nCut cold boiled potatoes lengthwise into quarter-inch slices, dip each\r\nin flour, and lay in a folding broiler. Broil until evenly browned\r\non both sides, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve on a hot dish\r\nwith a bit of butter on each, or as a garnish to other vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED POTATOES SOUFFLÉ\r\n\r\nPeel and trim the required number of potatoes to a uniform size,\r\ncut both ends straight across, and then slice the potatoes into\r\nslices about 1/16 of an inch thick, and drop them into cold water for\r\nabout half an hour, and then dry them with a cloth. For the frying\r\ntwo kettles of fat are necessary, one of which must be perfectly\r\nfresh; drop the potatoes into the used fat or oil and let them fry\r\nuntil about half done; but do not let them brown at all; drain them\r\nthoroughly and let them get cold. Five or six minutes before they\r\nare to be served drop them into the fresh fat which should be almost\r\nsmoking, move them about lightly with a fork, and they will puff out\r\nto a considerable size; let them become a golden brown, put them in\r\nthe oven on brown paper for a moment, and serve instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOLE POTATOES FRIED\r\n\r\nUse very small new potatoes, and, after boiling them, roll in egg and\r\ncracker crumbs, and fry in hot, deep fat. Use alone or as a garnish\r\nto baked tomatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH-FRIED POTATOES\r\n\r\nPeel potatoes which are of medium size and cut into even eighths,\r\nlengthwise, and then let them lie in cold water for fifteen minutes;\r\nthen dry them between the folds of a clean cloth, and put in a frying\r\nbasket. Immerse slowly in hot fat, and fry until a golden brown;\r\ndrain at once, and dredge with salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSARATOGA CHIPS\r\n\r\nCut potatoes into thin slices with a potato cutter, lay in cold water\r\ntwenty minutes, dry, and fry in deep, hot fat until crisp. Drain from\r\nthe fat onto brown paper, dredge with salt, and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES PARISIAN\r\n\r\nThese are cooked exactly like French-fried potatoes, except that the\r\nlittle vegetable cutter, which cuts tiny globes of potato, is used\r\nto form the shapes. Some care must be taken to use strength enough\r\nwith the cutter to make it cut perfectly round balls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO STRAWS\r\n\r\nPeel 4 or 5 potatoes and then cut them with a patent vegetable cutter\r\nin strings; lay them in very cold water for twenty minutes, drain,\r\nand put in a frying basket, and slowly immerse in hot fat, and let them\r\nfry until a golden brown. Drain, and dredge with salt before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO CRADLES\r\n\r\nPeel, wash, and dry potatoes of uniform size and shape. Cut in two,\r\nlengthwise, and scoop out the inside, and fry the potato cases in\r\nhot fat until brown; then drain and sprinkle with salt. Serve hot\r\npeas heaped up in each cradle and garnish with mint or parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES LYONNAISE\r\n\r\nTake 5 or 6 cold boiled potatoes and cut them in slices. Put 1\r\ntablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when it is melted add 2\r\nthinly sliced, medium-sized onions, and fry these, letting them cook\r\nvery slowly ten minutes; then season with pepper and salt and add\r\nthe sliced potatoes, and let these fry slowly, turning with a knife\r\nuntil they are a golden brown; season afresh with pepper and salt,\r\nand add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley before serving. These\r\npotatoes will take a great deal of salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN FRIED POTATOES\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 5\r\nor 6 cold boiled potatoes cut in slices, season highly with salt and\r\npepper, fry until done, which will be about twelve or fifteen minutes,\r\nturning with a knife; when nearly done stop stirring, and let the\r\npotatoes brown on the bottom of the pan; serve in a hot dish with\r\nthe browned slices on the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED POTATO SAVOURY\r\n\r\nFry cold sliced or diced potatoes, and when browned add 1/2 teaspoon\r\nof onion juice or extract, then arrange in a buttered baking dish in\r\nlayers with grated cheese, pepper, salt, and some butter in each layer,\r\ncover the top with a few brown crumbs and chopped parsley or chives,\r\nand let heat a few minutes in the oven. Chopped chives can be arranged\r\nwith the layers of potato if the flavour is liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED POTATOES\r\n\r\nPut 2 tablespoons of butter into a saucepan, and when melted add 1\r\ntablespoon of minced parsley and pepper and salt, stir until very hot,\r\nthen add a scant cup of milk, containing 1 teaspoon of flour and a\r\npinch of soda, and when this boils add diced cold boiled potatoes,\r\nand, when thoroughly heated through, serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCALLOPED POTATOES\r\n\r\nBoil 10 or 12 medium-sized potatoes in their skins, and after peeling\r\nslice them in slices 1/4 of an inch thick. While the potatoes are\r\nboiling make a sauce of 2 cups of milk, the juice of 1 onion, salt\r\nand pepper, 2 tablespoons of butter, and 1 tablespoon of thickening\r\nflour. Butter a baking dish, and arrange a layer of potatoes, cover\r\nwith sauce, then put another layer of potatoes, and so continue\r\nuntil the dish is filled. Then cut 2 hard-boiled eggs in neat slices,\r\narrange them over the top, sprinkle with cracker crumbs and a little\r\nfinely chopped parsley, and cook ten or twelve minutes in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES DELMONICO\r\n\r\nFor a large baking dish 4 cups of cold boiled diced potatoes will\r\nbe required. Butter a baking dish, and put a layer of potatoes an\r\ninch deep in the bottom, and cover this with well made white sauce,\r\nand sprinkle slightly with salt and pepper; then add another layer of\r\npotato, and white sauce, and seasoning, and so on, until the dish is\r\nheaping full, and then sprinkle the top with grated cheese, and let\r\nbrown well in a hot oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOAK HILL POTATOES\r\n\r\nButter a baking dish well, and place in it alternate layers of sliced\r\ncold boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, seasoning each layer; then\r\npour over it a white sauce in which grated cheese is melted. Cover\r\nthe top of the dish with cracker crumbs, and brown in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEILBRONN POTATOES\r\n\r\nPut 2 tablespoons of butter in a deep saucepan, and when melted stir\r\ninto it, with a flat-ended wooden spoon, 2 tablespoons of flour and\r\nlet brown, then add 2 tablespoons of vinegar and use 2 cups of boiling\r\nwater or vegetable stock in making this into a smooth sauce. Add 1/2\r\nan onion, sliced, 2 cloves, 2 allspice, a piece of thin lemon peel,\r\n1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and let cook very slowly, stirring for\r\nten minutes. Then add more vegetable stock or boiling water to make a\r\nthin sauce and strain it; return to the fire and add 5 or 6 parboiled\r\nthinly sliced potatoes, 2 tablespoons of capers, and let cook slowly\r\nfor fifteen minutes, stirring frequently; then pour into the saucepan\r\n1/2 cup of cream (sour preferred), and serve in a deep, hot dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOURY POTATO CAKES\r\n\r\nChop 6 cold boiled potatoes, and crush with a potato masher (or\r\nuse cold mashed potato); add to them 1 tablespoon of mixed herbs,\r\n1 teaspoon of chopped onions, pepper, salt, 1 tablespoon of melted\r\nbutter, and 1 beaten egg; mould into flat cakes, and put in a frying\r\npan containing 1 tablespoon of melted butter; brown, and turn with\r\na pancake turner to brown the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO HASH\r\n\r\nPut 8 cold boiled potatoes and 2 medium-sized onions in a chopping\r\nbowl and chop them fine. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large\r\nfrying pan, place the potatoes and onion in it, and smooth the top\r\neven with a fork. Season well with salt and pepper and put over a\r\nmoderately hot fire, shaking the pan vigorously from time to time to\r\nkeep the hash from burning. If it is shaken instead of being stirred\r\nit will brown well on the bottom. Turn out onto a hot serving dish,\r\nwith the browned part on top, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO OMELET\r\n\r\nButter a frying pan with 1 teaspoon of butter, and cover the bottom of\r\nthe pan with sliced cold boiled potatoes laid flat; let these fry a\r\nfew moments, then pour over them 2 well-beaten eggs and 1 tablespoon\r\nof chopped parsley or chives, season well with salt and pepper,\r\nand turn from the pan when browned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRIED POTATOES\r\n\r\nChop 1 good-sized onion very fine, and fry in 2 tablespoons of butter\r\nuntil transparent and cooked, but not brown; then remove most of the\r\nonion with a strainer, pressing the juice from it into the butter,\r\nand put in 4 or 5 sliced cold boiled potatoes; sprinkle some curry\r\npowder and salt and pepper over them and fry, turning them frequently\r\nuntil done. The amount of curry can vary from 1 to 2 teaspoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO FRICASSEE\r\n\r\nPut in a saucepan 1 generous tablespoon of butter and 1 cup of milk;\r\nwhen hot add some cold potatoes cut in dice, season with pepper, salt,\r\nand a few drops of onion juice. Let them get thoroughly hot, then\r\nadd the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, stir constantly until thick. Great\r\ncare must be taken not to let it cook too long or the sauce will\r\ncurdle. Add a little chopped parsley before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES RENNEQUIN\r\n\r\nBoil 6 potatoes, peel them, and let them dry in a warm place on\r\nthe stove.\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter into a saucepan, and when partly melted\r\nslice the potatoes into it. Now add 1 tablespoon of water, some salt,\r\npepper, and 1 tablespoon of minced parsley; let it become thoroughly\r\nheated, then add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES AND CHEESE\r\n\r\nMince or chop fine 5 or 6 peeled raw potatoes, and toss in a saucepan\r\nwith 2 tablespoons of butter until cooked.

Make a white sauce of 1\r\ntablespoon of flour, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1 cup of milk seasoned\r\nhighly with salt and pepper, and, after arranging the boiled potatoes\r\nin a baking dish or casserole, pour the sauce over them, and on the\r\ntop of all pour 1 well-beaten egg. Put the dish in the oven and let it\r\nstay just long enough to set the egg. Sprinkle with chopped parsley\r\nbefore sending to the table. If preferred the egg can be added to\r\nthe white sauce instead of being put on top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOCK NEW POTATOES\r\n\r\nPeel the required number of large old potatoes, and with a Parisian\r\npotato cutter cut them into small balls; drop these in boiling water,\r\nand when done cover with a highly seasoned white sauce, to which is\r\nadded a very little chopped parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nAs the skin of sweet potatoes does not come off well after cooking\r\nit is best to peel them before baking or boiling.\r\n\r\nSelect large sweet potatoes, put them in boiling water, and let them\r\nboil from half to three quarters of an hour. Peel them and arrange\r\nthem in a hot dish, with 1/2 cup of melted butter poured over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nWash and peel the sweet potatoes and put them in the oven.

Heap in a buttered\r\nbaking dish and let brown in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCALLOPED SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nSlice what will make 4 or 5 cups of cold boiled sweet potatoes,\r\nbutter a baking dish, and arrange a layer of potatoes in the bottom,\r\nmaking it an inch thick. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and dot well\r\nwith butter. Then arrange another layer, proceed as before, and so\r\non until the dish is filled. Then pour over all 1/2 cup of water in\r\nwhich 2 tablespoons of sugar are dissolved. Put the dish in the oven,\r\nand in ten minutes baste with 2 tablespoons of water. Let cook five\r\nminutes more or until browned on top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUFFED SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nBake in their skins the number of potatoes required, cut them in half,\r\nscoop out the inside, and mix with chopped celery, and minced onion,\r\nand melted butter, allowing 1 tablespoon of celery and 1/2 teaspoon of\r\nonion to each potato. Season with salt and pepper, refill the skins,\r\nand let brown in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN SWEET POTATO PIE\r\n\r\nBake 4 large sweet potatoes, then scrape the inside from them, and beat\r\ninto it lightly with a fork 2 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of\r\nsugar, 3 well-beaten eggs, 1 cup of warm milk, a saltspoon of salt,\r\nand a pinch of mixed spice. Line a baking dish with pastry, fill with\r\nthe potato, and bake for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXAS SWEET POTATO PIE\r\n\r\nBoil 4 or 5 sweet potatoes for half an hour or until cooked. Line\r\na large baking dish with pie-crust, slice the potatoes lengthwise\r\nwhile still hot, and put a layer of them on the crust, and cover this\r\nwith long strips of pastry. Sprinkle with sugar, dot with butter,\r\nand add a little nutmeg; then place another layer of potato, and\r\nanother of pastry, and so on, until the dish is nearly filled. Pour\r\non enough boiling water to almost fill the dish, and cover the top\r\nwith pastry like any deep pie, cutting it here and there to let the\r\nsteam escape. Bake for about twenty minutes, or until the crust is\r\na little browned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARYLAND SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nPeel 6 or 8 medium-sized sweet potatoes, quarter them lengthwise,\r\nand lay them in a large saucepan having rounded sides. Add to the\r\npotatoes 2 heaping tablespoons of butter, and 3 heaping tablespoons of\r\ngranulated sugar, and 2 or 3 tablespoons of water, and stir until the\r\nsugar and butter are dissolved. Cover closely and let them cook for\r\nfour or five minutes undisturbed, then stir again with a wooden spoon,\r\nbeing careful to see that the syrup is not sticking on the bottom,\r\nre-cover, and from now on let cook only a couple of moments at a time\r\nbefore again stirring. The water will of course soon cook away; let\r\nthe potatoes cook rapidly in the hot syrup until they begin to soften,\r\nthen put them where the fire is less hot, and let them cook slowly\r\nuntil done. The entire cooking should not take more than fifteen\r\nor twenty minutes, and the thick brown sauce should be thoroughly\r\nscraped from the saucepan and served over the sweet potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDIED SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nLay pared sweet potatoes cut in slices in a buttered baking dish\r\nwith a cover. Sprinkle each layer with brown sugar, salt and pepper\r\nand cinnamon, and dot with bits of butter. Pour in 1/2 cup of boiling\r\nwater for 1/2 dozen potatoes and baste while cooking. Cook moderately\r\nuntil tender, from half an hour to three quarters, depending on the\r\nheat of the oven. The cinnamon can be omitted if not liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIDDLED SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nCut cold boiled sweet potatoes in slices, lengthwise, and lay them\r\non a buttered griddle; when browned on one side turn with a pancake\r\nturner and brown the other side. Sprinkle with salt and serve very hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nCut cold boiled sweet potatoes in half-inch squares and fry them in\r\nmelted butter.

Drain\r\nand sprinkle with salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLAZED SWEET POTATOES\r\n\r\nLet sweet potatoes boil until nearly done, then drain and cool. When\r\ncold cut them in inch-thick slices, or into rounds with a patent\r\ncutter, mix them well with melted butter and sugar, using 2 tablespoons\r\nof sugar to each 1/2 cup of butter, and put them in a deep dish in\r\na hot oven for ten minutes, or until well browned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED SALSIFY (OYSTER PLANT)\r\n\r\nRemove the tops from 2 bunches of salsify, scrape and cut to shape,\r\nand put in a bowl of cold water containing some lemon juice, to\r\nretain the whiteness. Drain and put in boiling water, using enough\r\nto cover it, and let cook about three quarters of an hour, salting\r\nthe water during the last half-hour's boiling. Drain and serve with\r\nhighly seasoned white sauce or parsley sauce made with the water in\r\nwhich the salsify cooked, with the addition of a little milk or cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH SALSIFY\r\n\r\nBoil salsify as directed above, drain, and serve with bread sauce,\r\nserving fine browned bread crumbs with the sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALSIFY IN COQUILLES\r\n\r\nBoil the salsify as directed, and press through a sieve; then beat\r\ninto it 1 tablespoon of butter, season highly, arrange in buttered\r\ncoquilles or ramekins, sprinkle grated cheese over the top, and let\r\nbrown in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCALLOPED SALSIFY\r\n\r\nBoil salsify as directed, not letting it quite finish cooking;\r\nslice, and arrange in buttered baking dish, with layers of slightly\r\nbrowned crumbs dotted with butter, and sprinkled with pepper, salt,\r\nand paprika. Pour 1/2 cup of milk or cream over to dampen, then cover\r\nthe top with crumbs, and bake about fifteen minutes. An egg can be\r\nbeaten with the milk to make the dish richer if wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASHED BLACK SALSIFY (SCHWARZWURZEL)\r\n\r\nProceed as with ordinary salsify, except that it is best not to peel\r\nor cut this sort of salsify until after boiling. When boiled, peel,\r\nand mash the white part, using 1 tablespoon of cream to each cup of\r\nsalsify, 1 teaspoon of butter, pepper, and salt. Arrange in individual\r\ndishes or cases with crumbs on top, and bake ten minutes to brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED SALSIFY TARTARE\r\n\r\nUse cold boiled salsify, cut in any shape desired, dip in egg and\r\ncrumbs, and fry in hot fat until browned. Drain well, dredge with salt,\r\nand serve with sauce Tartare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINACH\r\n\r\nSpinach should be well picked over, leaf by leaf, and washed in\r\nseveral different waters, and changed to a different pan each time it\r\nis washed, that the sand may be left behind with each washing. Then\r\nput it in a large kettle, with a scant cup of water for a peck of\r\nspinach, and let it cook over a slow fire until tender; in this way\r\nits own juices will be extracted, and it will be more tasty than if\r\ncooked in water. It should be then drained and chopped extremely fine,\r\nor until as nearly a pulp as possible, and then mashed in a mortar or\r\nwith a potato-masher. It is then ready to prepare in any way desired\r\nfor the table.\r\n\r\nDelicious spinach can be had canned, and if this is used it needs only\r\nto be very finely chopped and mashed, then seasoned, and prepared in\r\nany of the following ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SPINACH\r\n\r\nMelt 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and in it let simmer\r\nfor ten minutes 1 good-sized onion that has been finely chopped,\r\nthen add 4 cups of the boiled, chopped, and mashed spinach to it,\r\nand stir well together, and season thoroughly with salt and pepper;\r\nfinish with 1/2 teaspoon of grated nutmeg, and 1 or 2 tablespoons of\r\nwhipped cream, and pile high in a heated dish, covering the top with\r\nthe chopped whites and riced yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINACH WITH WHITE SAUCE\r\n\r\nPrepare as in the above recipe, using, instead of the cream, 1/2 cup\r\nof highly seasoned white sauce, and at the last add the juice of 1\r\nlemon or 1 tablespoon of reduced vinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SPINACH WITH RHUBARB\r\n\r\nAnother German way of preparing spinach is to cook rhubarb leaves or\r\nflowers (or both) with the spinach for the purée and to add chives. If\r\ncanned spinach is used the rhubarb leaves should be cooked and chopped\r\nand added to the canned spinach before it is macerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN SPINACH\r\n\r\nWash 1/2 peck spinach and cook twenty-five minutes without\r\nwater. Drain, chop to a fine pulp, mash until smooth in a mortar,\r\nseason with 1 tablespoon of butter, salt and pepper, and encircle with\r\na garnish of well-scrambled eggs to which has been added 2 tablespoons\r\nof grated cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVELTY SPINACH\r\n\r\nDrain a can of spinach and chop it very fine, and then mash it until\r\nsmooth. Put it in a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of chopped chives\r\nor grated onion, salt and pepper, and sprinkle the whole surface\r\nwell with grated nutmeg. Hard boil 3 eggs, remove the yolks, and\r\nmix them thoroughly with the spinach. Chop the whites, and arrange\r\nthe spinach on rounds of toast, placing 2 tablespoons on each piece,\r\ngarnish with the whites of the eggs, and pour on each 2 tablespoons of\r\ncheese sauce. If the arrangement on toast is not desired, the cheese\r\nsauce can be mixed with the spinach before serving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINACH SOUFFLÉ\r\n\r\nTake 2 cups of cooked chopped spinach, mash to a pulp, add 1 cup of\r\nwhite sauce and the whites of 2 eggs beaten very stiff, season well,\r\nand pile lightly in timbale cups; set these in a pan of water, and let\r\nbake in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes or less. Before serving\r\nsprinkle the top of each with riced yolk of hard-boiled egg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED SQUASH OR PUMPKIN\r\n\r\nCut a pumpkin or a squash in triangular or square pieces, about three\r\ninches across, scrape the seeds, etc., from each piece, and sprinkle\r\nwith salt and pepper, and spread with butter. Set in a moderate oven\r\nand bake for half an hour or until browned. Serve garnished with sprigs\r\nof parsley. It should be eaten from the shell with additional butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA SQUASH\r\n\r\nTake a very young summer squash, which if it be young enough need\r\nnot be pared, and cut it into small pieces. Fry half an onion in a\r\ntablespoon of butter, and when transparent and beginning to brown\r\nadd the squash to it and season with salt and pepper. Let all cook\r\ntogether for ten minutes, and then add 1/4 of a cup of hot water,\r\nand let cook until the squash is quite tender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED TOMATOES\r\n\r\nEmpty 1 can of tomatoes into a double boiler, and put with them 1\r\ncup of crumbled bread without crust, stir well together, season with\r\npepper and salt, cover, and let cook slowly for half an hour, stirring\r\nfrom time to time. Just before serving add a piece of butter the size\r\nof a walnut. While the tomatoes will be ready to serve with half an\r\nhour's cooking, they are improved by cooking an hour, and are better\r\nstill if warmed again after cooling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCALLOPED TOMATOES\r\n\r\nDrain the juice from 1 can of tomatoes. Butter a baking dish, and\r\ncover the bottom with the tomatoes; dot with butter, dredge with\r\npepper and salt, and sprinkle generously with fine bread crumbs;\r\narrange another layer of tomatoes, and crumbs, and so proceed until the\r\ndish is filled. Pour over all enough of the juice of the tomatoes to\r\nmoisten well, and then finish the dish with a covering of crumbs. Bake\r\nfor twenty minutes in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREADED TOMATOES\r\n\r\nSlice large, solid tomatoes, dredge them on both sides with salt and\r\npepper, and dip each slice in beaten egg, and then in fine bread or\r\ncracker crumbs. Arrange them in a frying basket, and plunge them in\r\nhot, deep fat for one or two minutes to brown. Drain, and garnish\r\nwith sprays of parsley, or use as a garnish to other vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED TOMATOES\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted lay in\r\nthickly sliced tomatoes which have been rolled in egg and crumbs;\r\nwhen browned on one side turn them with a pancake turner and brown\r\nthe other side, seasoning with pepper and salt. Remove to the serving\r\ndish with a pancake turner, seasoning the first side cooked after\r\nthey are turned onto the dish. A half a teaspoon of onion juice may\r\nbe added to the butter in which they are cooking if desired. Serve\r\nplain or with white sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVILLED TOMATOES\r\n\r\nCut in half and broil three or four nice solid tomatoes, and serve them\r\nwith a sauce made as follows: Take the yolks of 4 hard-boiled eggs and\r\ncrush them with a fork, add to them a scant teaspoon of dry mustard,\r\n1 heaping saltspoon of salt, and several shakes of paprika, or a dash\r\nof cayenne pepper; mix these dry ingredients well together, and then\r\nadd to them 5 tablespoons of melted butter, 2 tablespoons of vinegar\r\nor lemon juice, and heat in a double boiler; when it begins to thicken\r\nremove from the fire and stir in 1 well-beaten egg. Chop the whites of\r\nthe boiled eggs, and put with them 2 teaspoons of chopped parsley, and\r\ndecorate the centre of each broiled tomato with this before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED TOMATOES\r\n\r\nTake solid, medium-sized tomatoes, and, having cut a circular piece out\r\nof the stem-end, scoop out most of the inside, and fill with parboiled\r\ncelery cut in half-inch lengths, mixed with an equal quantity of\r\ncanned peas, and dampened with white sauce; heap 1 teaspoon of peas\r\non the top of each tomato, and bake for twenty minutes or more,\r\nand serve with highly seasoned white sauce poured over each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED TOMATOES WITH MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nWash good solid tomatoes and carefully cut out the inside; dredge\r\nwith pepper and salt and fill the tomato with sauté mushrooms, using\r\neither fresh or canned ones, chopped and fried in butter. Bake for\r\nabout twenty minutes, or until heated through but not broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES WITH NUT FORCE-MEAT\r\n\r\nSlice the stem-end from 6 large, solid tomatoes, scoop out the\r\ninside, and fill with a force-meat made of one cup of crumbs, 1/2\r\ncup of chopped nuts, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1\r\ntablespoon of melted butter, 1/2 tablespoon of grated onion, and 1\r\negg. Replace the tops on the tomatoes and bake them for about twenty\r\nminutes, watching that the skins do not break, as they will do in a\r\ntoo hot oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES STUFFED WITH EGG AND PEPPERS\r\n\r\nCut the inside from solid, large tomatoes, and refill with a mixture of\r\nequal parts of chopped hard-boiled eggs and chopped sweet green peppers\r\n(or use pimentos) well moistened with melted butter and onion juice,\r\nand seasoned with salt. Put in a baking dish, cover, and let bake\r\nfor twenty minutes in a moderate oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED TOMATOES WITH GREEN PEPPERS\r\n\r\nScoop out the inside from solid tomatoes, and refill with the tomato\r\nmeat which has been cut out of the centre and chopped with sweet green\r\npeppers, using 1 teaspoon of peppers to each tomato, and 1 teaspoon\r\nof cracker crumbs or boiled rice; season with pepper and salt, and\r\nplace 1/4 teaspoon of butter in each tomato before laying the top on;\r\nthen bake in a moderate oven about twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES FILLED WITH EGG\r\n\r\nSelect very large solid tomatoes, and with a small, sharp knife cut a\r\nround piece out of the stem-end, then cut out a large enough space from\r\nthe inside to hold a small egg, and arrange in a shallow pan. Sprinkle\r\nwith salt and pepper, add 1/2 teaspoon of grated onion, and set in a\r\nhot oven for five or six minutes. Remove, and break into each tomato\r\nthe yolk of 1 egg and as much of the white as it will hold without\r\nrunning over the edge. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a little chopped\r\nparsley, and replace in the oven, letting them cook slowly fifteen\r\nminutes until the egg is set. Remove to individual plates for serving,\r\ntaking care to not break the tomato. Garnish with cress or parsley.\r\n\r\nTomatoes may be stuffed in a great variety of ways,--with fillings\r\nof fried cucumber, tomato, and chopped onions, or bread dressing with\r\nsage, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES STUFFED WITH SPINACH\r\n\r\nCut an opening in the top of large, solid tomatoes, and scoop out some\r\nof the inside with a spoon, fill with \"German spinach,\" and place in a\r\nhot oven for about twenty minutes; upon removing from the oven cover\r\neach with a slice of hard-boiled egg, or use the white rim filled\r\nwith riced yolks. Serve alone or as a garnish for another vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES STUFFED WITH MACARONI\r\n\r\nScoop the inside from 6 large, solid tomatoes and use it with 1 bay\r\nleaf and some melted butter to make a tomato sauce. Into this stir\r\n1/2 cup of boiled macaroni (spaghetti or rice may also be used),\r\nand, after seasoning well with salt and pepper, fill the tomatoes\r\nwith the macaroni, putting 1 teaspoon of grated cheese on the top\r\nof each. Bake in a moderate oven for about twenty minutes or less,\r\nand garnish with watercress or parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN RAREBIT\r\n\r\nPut a little water and 1 large tablespoon of butter in a frying pan,\r\nand when melted add 1 large Spanish onion or 3 ordinary onions chopped\r\nfine, and let simmer slowly ten minutes. Strain the juice from a can\r\nof tomatoes, and put the tomatoes in a double boiler; when they are\r\nheated through scrape the onions into the tomatoes, and let them all\r\ncook together for half an hour; season highly with salt and pepper,\r\nand just before serving add 2 or 3 well-beaten eggs, and let stand for\r\na few minutes until somewhat thickened; serve on toast. If the flavour\r\nof onions is liked, a larger quantity of chopped onion may be used;\r\nand to increase the quantity, 3 or 4 more eggs may be added to this\r\nrule without other changes. For chafing-dish prepare in advance to\r\nthe point where the eggs are added, and add these after reheating in\r\nthe chafing-dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES AND ONION\r\n\r\nProceed as in the preceding recipe without adding the eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES CASINO\r\n\r\nSelect large, solid tomatoes, and without cutting them let them\r\nboil for fifteen minutes; then slip off the skins, halve them,\r\nand lay each piece, cut-side down, on a round of toast the same\r\nsize as the tomato. Cover the top with warm Hollandaise, Bernaise,\r\nor Maître d'hôtel sauce, and in the centre lay a slice of truffle;\r\ngarnish with watercress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES INDIENNE\r\n\r\nHalve large, solid tomatoes, and arrange them in a shallow pan,\r\ncut-side up. Dredge with salt and pepper, and spread with curry powder\r\nand some onion juice. Put in the oven for ten minutes, or under the\r\ngas burners of the oven in a gas stove. Do not let the tomatoes soften,\r\nand serve at once to prevent this. Use alone or as a garnish to rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES WITH EGGS\r\n\r\nStrain 1 can of tomatoes and put them in a saucepan; stir well, and\r\nseason with pepper and salt and 1 tablespoon of butter, and, after\r\nthey have cooked fifteen or twenty minutes, stir in 3 or 4 well-beaten\r\neggs and serve on toast after two or three minutes' further cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRIED TOMATOES\r\n\r\nCut a thin slice from the stem-end of large, solid tomatoes, and\r\nscoop out some of the inside. Fill with boiled rice to which is added\r\nthe tomato removed from the inside and a little curry powder (1/2\r\nteaspoon to 1 cup of rice is a moderate amount). Season the mixture\r\nwell with salt, replace the top, and bake fifteen minutes. The curry\r\npowder can be omitted from the filling and the tomatoes served with\r\ncurry sauce if preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOURY TOMATOES\r\n\r\nCut in half rather large, solid tomatoes, allowing 2 halves for each\r\nperson to be served, and set them, cut-side up, in a shallow tin;\r\npress capers into the spaces, then dredge heavily with celery salt,\r\nsprinkle with salt and pepper, and set under the flame of a gas oven\r\nuntil the tops are blackened. The flame should be hot so that this\r\nmay happen as quickly as possible in order that the tomatoes may\r\nnot become softened by the heat; to this end it is also necessary to\r\nleave the door of the broiling compartment open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES CREOLE\r\n\r\nCut in half, crosswise, 5 or 6 solid tomatoes, and set them, cut halves\r\nupwards, in a buttered pan. Chop 1 or 2 sweet green peppers, mix with\r\nthem 1 teaspoon of chopped onion, and sprinkle this over the tomatoes;\r\nplace a small piece of butter on each half, and sprinkle with salt\r\nand paprika. Let bake about twenty minutes, then remove to rounds of\r\ntoast, or nests of boiled rice, and pour over them white sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO LOAF\r\n\r\nStrain the juice from 1 can of tomatoes through a sieve fine enough to\r\nstop all the seeds, and put in an enamelled saucepan to boil; season\r\nwell with salt and pepper, and when it boils pour it onto enough\r\ngelatine dissolved in water to stiffen it. The amount of gelatine\r\ncannot be given, as the various vegetable gelatines, arrowroot, etc.,\r\nvary in thickening power. Instructions as to the proper amount for each\r\npint of liquid will come with every package. Set the jelly aside to\r\ncool, and arrange slices of hard-boiled egg on the bottom of custard\r\ncups or small plain moulds, and encircle these with slices of stuffed\r\nolive, pickled walnut, or truffles, or mushrooms. When the jelly is\r\nsomewhat cooled, and so thick enough to hold down these garnishings\r\nwhen poured onto them, half fill the cups with it. Serve when set\r\nand ice-cold, turned out on lettuce leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES AND HOMINY\r\n\r\nTake 2 cups of cold boiled hominy and 2 cups of boiled tomatoes,\r\nput them in a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of butter, season generously\r\nwith salt and pepper, and serve in a deep dish when thoroughly heated\r\nthrough, or put into a buttered baking dish with crumbs on the top\r\n(and a little grated cheese if liked); brown before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED TURNIPS\r\n\r\nPeel and wash turnips and cut them in eighths lengthwise, or in dice,\r\nand put them in boiling milk and water which covers them. Let them\r\ncook slowly for half an hour uncovered, then lift them out and place\r\non a hot dish at the side of the stove. Make a sauce with 1 1/2 cups\r\nof the stock in which they cooked, into which beat the yolk of 1 egg\r\nand 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice; season this with pepper and salt and\r\npour over the turnips. Instead of this, ordinary white sauce may be\r\nmade of the turnip stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASHED TURNIPS\r\n\r\nPeel and quarter 2 good-sized turnips, cover them with boiling\r\nwater, and let cook until tender, which should be in from half an\r\nhour to three quarters; drain them in a colander, and press gently\r\nwith a wire potato-masher to remove as much water as possible, then\r\nmash them and beat them well, stirring in 2 tablespoons of butter,\r\n1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 saltspoon of pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASHED TURNIPS AND POTATO\r\n\r\nPrepare turnips as for mashed turnips, and mash with them an equal\r\nquantity of boiled potatoes; add butter, pepper, and salt, and beat\r\nup very light before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNIPS AU GRATIN\r\n\r\nCut boiled turnips in thin slices, and arrange them in a buttered\r\nbaking dish in layers one inch deep; sprinkle each layer with melted\r\nbutter, pepper, salt, and grated cheese. Finish with cheese on the top,\r\nand bake for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGOUT OF TURNIPS\r\n\r\nPut 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1\r\ntablespoon of chopped onion and 4 cups of diced turnips, and stir until\r\nthey begin to brown; season with 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of\r\npepper, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and add slowly 1 cup of vegetable broth\r\nor milk into which 1 tablespoon of flour has been made smooth. Let\r\nsimmer gently for half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELTOWER RÜBCHEN\r\n\r\nBuy the imported \"rübchen,\" which are the daintiest tiny turnips, and\r\nheat them in their own liquor; then drain and serve with Spanish sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARISIAN TURNIPS\r\n\r\nCut turnips into small rounds with a Parisian potato cutter, and boil\r\nthem for half an hour or until tender, the time depending largely\r\nupon the age of the turnips. Drain, and cover with highly seasoned\r\nwhite sauce, to which 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Kindness to animals is not mere sentiment but a requisite of\r\n    even a very ordinary education; nothing in arithmetic or\r\n    grammar is so important for a child to learn as humaneness.\r\n\r\n                                           Journal of Education, Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE COMBINATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOP SUEY\r\n\r\nPut 1 cup of onions, fried until brown, 1 cup of celery cut in\r\ntwo-inch pieces and then shredded and stewed in vegetable stock for\r\nhalf an hour, 1 cup of fried mushrooms, and 2 cups of boiled rice in\r\na saucepan with a cup of thin brown sauce. Let all heat together for\r\nten minutes, and season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLCANNON\r\n\r\nThis is made by the mixture of two or more vegetables already\r\nboiled. Use equal parts of mashed potato and sprouts (or any greens)\r\nfinely minced, and grated onion if wanted, and add some mashed carrots\r\nor turnips or both; season with salt and pepper. Mix 2 eggs through\r\n4 or 5 cups of vegetables, press into a mould, and boil or steam for\r\nhalf an hour. Turn out to serve, and serve plain or with a brown sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACEDOINE OF VEGETABLES\r\n\r\nBoil 1 small cauliflower and set it aside to drain; then boil 2\r\ncups of diced carrots, drain them when tender, but reserve the\r\nstock. Add to the carrots the cauliflower carefully separated into\r\nlittle pieces, 2 cups of boiled peas, or 1 can, 1 cup of cooked or\r\ncanned flageolets, 1/2 a cup of carrot stock, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt,\r\n1 small saltspoon of pepper, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let simmer\r\ntogether until heated, and then add 1 chopped onion, 2 bay leaves,\r\n1 tablespoon of butter. If liked, a sauce made of 1 tablespoon of\r\nbutter and 1 tablespoon of flour thinned with the carrot stock and\r\nhighly seasoned can be strained over the vegetables before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED MACEDOINE OF VEGETABLES\r\n\r\nDelicious combinations of peas, shaped carrots, flageolets, etc.,\r\ncan be had in bottles. Drain them, and put in a saucepan with 1\r\ntablespoon of butter and some pepper and salt. When hot serve or add\r\n1/2 cup of cream. Serve to garnish, or alone, or use to fill peppers,\r\nor tomatoes, or patties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE CHOWDER\r\n\r\nPare and slice in rather thick slices, enough potatoes to make 4 cups,\r\nand prepare the same amount of shredded cabbage, and sliced onions. Put\r\n2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add the onions,\r\nand cook them for ten minutes. Butter a large casserole, arrange over\r\nthe bottom a layer of sliced potato, then a layer of cabbage, then\r\none of onions, seasoning each with pepper and salt, and sprinkling\r\nwith chopped hard-boiled egg, and so fill the dish. Pour 2 cups of\r\nmilk, into which 1 tablespoon of flour has been made smooth, over\r\nthe chowder, set the dish in a shallow pan of water, and bake slowly\r\nfor one hour. If the milk cooks away add a little more during the\r\ncooking. The same dish can be made in a kettle, in which case halve\r\nthe potatoes and cook for three quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE PIE (ST. GEORGE'S HOUSE)\r\n\r\nBoil enough carrots, turnips, and large white haricot beans to make\r\na 1/2 cup of each when chopped or sliced after cooling, and enough\r\npotatoes to make a scant cup when sliced. Slice enough Bermuda onions\r\nto make 1/2 cup, and fry in butter until golden brown; then mix the\r\nonions and prepared vegetables, and add to them 1/4 cup each of canned\r\npeas, green beans, and tomatoes. Season well with salt and pepper,\r\nstir in 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, dampen with the water in which\r\nthe haricot beans cooked, heap into a deep baking dish, cover with\r\na good crust, and bake until slightly browned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE HASH\r\n\r\nChop separately 5 medium-sized potatoes, 2 sweet green peppers\r\n(carefully seeded), 5 fresh tomatoes, 1 cup of boiled beets (1/2 a\r\ncan), and 2 raw onions.\r\n\r\nPut 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add\r\nthe chopped onions, and let simmer slowly for five minutes, then\r\nadd the tomatoes and let simmer another five minutes, then put in\r\nthe potatoes, the peppers, and the beets. Dredge well with salt and\r\npepper, and, stirring occasionally, let all cook slowly until the\r\njuices are nearly absorbed; then let the hash brown on the bottom,\r\nand turn out with the brown on top. Garnish with squares of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE STEW\r\n\r\nPut 4 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan, and when melted add\r\nto it 1/2 cup of sliced onions, 1/2 cup of diced carrots, 1 cup of\r\nshredded celery, and 1/4 cup of turnips cut in oblong pieces, and\r\ntoss them in the butter for fifteen minutes; then pour over them 6\r\ncups of cold vegetable broth or water, add 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 bay\r\nleaves, 6 small onions halved, 4 carrots cut in quarters, 6 small\r\nsquares of turnip, and let simmer slowly for half an hour; then add\r\n5 potatoes cut in half, and let cook for half an hour more, and add\r\nmore vegetable broth to keep the vegetables covered. Make dumplings,\r\nand drop into the boiling stew, cover tightly, and cook ten minutes\r\nmore; season well with salt and pepper, and serve with enough of the\r\nstock, thickened with a little flour and butter, to cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE CASSEROLE\r\n\r\nIn order that this dish should taste and appear at its best, it\r\nshould be cooked and served in an Italian casserole dish from eight\r\nto ten inches in diameter. Peel 8 medium-sized onions, and take the\r\nlayers off until a centre about three quarters of an inch in diameter\r\nis left; toss the centres in hot butter until browned, and chop the\r\noutside. Cut 3 medium-sized sweet green peppers in half, lengthwise,\r\nand fill each half liberally with a mixture of bread crumbs, chopped\r\ntomato, chopped onion, and salt and pepper. Stuff 6 solid, medium-sized\r\ntomatoes in any of the ways described under stuffed tomatoes. Put\r\n2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add to it 2\r\ntablespoons of chopped onions; fry these for ten minutes, then stir\r\nin 2 tablespoons of flour, and use vegetable stock or milk, 2 cups\r\nof either, to make a sauce; add 1 bay leaf, and enough soup-browning\r\nto make a rich colour. Put the stuffed peppers in a casserole dish\r\nwith the glazed onion hearts and the sauce, cover, and let cook for\r\nten minutes; then arrange the stuffed tomatoes in the casserole,\r\ndistribute among them 1/2 can of button mushrooms, halved, 1/2 can\r\nof flageolets or peas, and leave the cover off the dish, letting it\r\ncook for fifteen minutes very slowly. This casserole can be varied\r\nin many ways, using different filling for the peppers and tomatoes,\r\nand either truffles, string beans, or fresh mushrooms in the sauce,\r\nwhich should not be too thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE RAGOUT\r\n\r\nPrepare for boiling what will make 3 cups of turnip when cut in inch\r\nsquares, 1 1/2 cups of potatoes, and 1 1/2 cups of carrots. Put the\r\ncarrots into slightly salted and sweetened water, let boil for ten\r\nminutes, then add the turnips and potato, and cook for ten minutes\r\nmore. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add\r\n2 tablespoons of chopped onion, and fry until slightly browned; then\r\nadd 2 tablespoons of flour, stir until smooth, and pour slowly into\r\nthis 2 cups of the stock in which the vegetables cooked; then add 2\r\nteaspoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper; and\r\nthe diced vegetables; cover, and let simmer slowly for half an hour,\r\nthen add 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDEAUX PIE\r\n\r\nSlice enough Spanish onions to fill a cup 1/4 full, and fry them in\r\nbutter until slightly browned. Boil carrots to equal 1/2 cup when\r\ndiced, potatoes enough to fill a cup 3/4 full, and peel 2 cups of\r\nmushrooms, and toss them in a little butter in a frying pan over a\r\nmoderate fire for ten minutes; hard boil 4 eggs, and make 1 cup of\r\nwhite sauce. Cut the vegetables in small pieces, slice the eggs,\r\nadd 1/4 cup of canned peas (or fresh boiled ones), 1 teaspoon of\r\nchopped parsley, salt and pepper well, put in a little grated nutmeg\r\nand 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and mix all carefully with the white\r\nsauce. Line a large baking dish (or small individual ones) with thin\r\ncrust, fill with the mixture, cover the top with crust, and bake\r\nuntil slightly browned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ORLEANS STEW\r\n\r\nSlice 3 onions, and fry them in 1 large tablespoon of butter for five\r\nminutes; then add to them 3 chopped sweet green peppers, stir well,\r\nand let cook together another five minutes; then scrape the contents\r\nof the frying pan into a double boiler, add the corn cut from 3 ears\r\nof sweet corn (or 1/2 can of corn), and 3 sliced tomatoes, 1 cup\r\nof water, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and let all cook\r\ntogether for one hour; season afresh before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN CURRY\r\n\r\nPut 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and add to it when\r\nmelted 2 onions chopped fine, and let cook very slowly for fifteen\r\nminutes. Mix 1 tablespoon of curry powder, 1 tablespoon of sour apple,\r\nor tamarind-chutney chopped fine, 1 teaspoon of salt, and enough\r\nvegetable stock to make a paste. When the onions are browned add this\r\npaste, and after stirring well put in 1 cup of boiled haricot beans,\r\n1 cup of halved boiled chestnuts, and 1 can of halved button mushrooms,\r\nand let all simmer together for ten minutes. Have ready some stock made\r\nby putting 2 tablespoons of desiccated cocoanut into a bowl and pouring\r\nover it 1 cup of boiling water, and use this to dampen the cooking\r\nvegetables; then add 1 cup of vegetable broth, and let cook ten minutes\r\nmore. We westerners are fond of this served in this way with chutney,\r\nbut in India they press it through a strainer and serve it as a purée,\r\nadding to it 2 well-beaten eggs. Encircle with rice in serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRY OF LENTILS\r\n\r\nSoak 2 or 3 cups of German or Egyptian lentils for two or three hours;\r\ndrain them, and put them in boiling water, and let them cook for\r\nthree quarters of an hour or until tender but not broken. Salt well\r\nwhen they have been cooking a short time, and when done drain them,\r\nsprinkle with salt, and heap in a pyramid on a round flat dish;\r\ngarnish with 3 hard-boiled eggs cut in half, encircle with boiled\r\nrice, and pour curry sauce over the lentils only. Serve extra sauce\r\nin a sauce-boat and Indian chutney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRY OF SUCCOTASH\r\n\r\nHeat 1 can of Lima beans and 1 can of sweet corn, and when hot drain,\r\nand heap on a flat dish; cover with curry sauce, and serve with potato\r\ncroquettes and Indian chutney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREOLE CURRY\r\n\r\nBoil 1 cup of rice, and while it is cooking put 2 cups of okra,\r\n2 cups of tomato, and 2 small onions cut in halves, and 1 teaspoon\r\nof butter in a double boiler, and when hot add 1 cup of hot water,\r\ninto which has been dissolved 1 heaping teaspoon of curry powder,\r\nand let all cook together for half an hour; remove the onions, add\r\nthe rice, season generously with salt, and serve with Indian chutney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS VEGETABLE CURRIES\r\n\r\nAlmost any vegetable makes a good curry,--flageolets, carrots and peas,\r\nbutton mushrooms, etc., and either boiled rice or rice croquettes\r\nshould be served. A garnish of Spanish pimentos looks well, and the\r\ncurry sauce should be plentiful. Hard-boiled eggs halved are always\r\nnice with curry, and Indian chutney should be served with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Speaking of the immortality of animals in 'Our Animal Friends,'\r\n    Charles Wagner says, 'Can that which comes from Life return to\r\n    Chaos?--Can a work of God have an end?'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT DISHES\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN CHESTNUTS\r\n\r\nChestnuts can be cooked either by roasting or by boiling. If roasted,\r\nthe thin brown that clings to the nut is removed with the outer\r\nshell; if boiled, the inner skin often has to be removed with some\r\ntrouble. Roast chestnuts by putting them in a hot oven for eight or\r\nten minutes, then use a small, sharp knife and peel them from the\r\npoint down.\r\n\r\nTo boil chestnuts put them, in their shells, in cold water and let\r\nthem cook for five or six minutes after the water starts boiling, or\r\nput them in boiling water for ten or twelve minutes. Peel carefully,\r\nand serve after roasting or boiling with brown sauce or mushroom sauce,\r\nplain or in cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUT PURÉE\r\n\r\nRoast or boil 6 cups of Italian chestnuts, remove the shell and inner\r\nskin and chop them fine or put them through a vegetable mill. Put\r\nthem in a double boiler with milk enough to cover them and let them\r\ncook slowly for fifteen or twenty minutes, or until the milk is all\r\nabsorbed. Stir frequently, add 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 tablespoon\r\nof cream, plenty of salt and a little pepper. The purée should be\r\nthe consistency of mashed potato.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEANUT PURÉE\r\n\r\nShell 3 or 4 cups of peanuts, remove the inner skin, and put through a\r\nvegetable mill. Put in a double boiler with milk to cover them, season\r\nwith salt, and let cook gently half an hour, or until tender. Stir\r\nfrequently, and serve when the milk is absorbed and the peanut purée\r\nis the consistency of mashed potato. A tablespoon of whipped cream\r\nis an improvement if added during the last moments of cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHAELMAS LOAF\r\n\r\nMix 1 cup of finely ground walnuts (or other nuts), 1 cup of finely\r\nground roasted peanuts, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper,\r\n2 1/2 cups of fine bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon of mixed sweet herbs\r\n(thyme, sage, and summer savory), and 1 large onion or 2 small ones\r\nchopped fine. When well blended bind together with 2 eggs which have\r\nbeen slightly beaten, mould with the hands into a loaf, place in\r\na well buttered roasting tin, and let it cook for ten minutes in a\r\nmoderately hot oven; then add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 cup of hot\r\nwater, and baste frequently during half an hour's cooking. The loaf\r\nshould be well browned and carefully removed to a hot platter. Make a\r\nbrown sauce in the pan in which the loaf cooked, and serve with this\r\nand cold apple sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS LOAF\r\n\r\nMake as in foregoing recipe, omitting the chopped onion and adding\r\nanother half tablespoon (or even more) of the sweet herbs. Serve with\r\ncranberry sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROAST NUT AND BARLEY LOAF\r\n\r\nMake a brown sauce with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1/2 cup of browned\r\nflour, and use water or vegetable stock for thinning; chop 1 large\r\nonion fine, and fry it in 1 tablespoon of oil or butter, and mix the\r\nonion and the sauce with 2 cups of cold boiled pearl barley, 1 cup of\r\nfinely ground roasted peanuts, 1 cup of fine bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon\r\nof salt, and 1 saltspoon of pepper. With the hands mould into a loaf,\r\nplace in a roasting pan which has been well buttered, and let cook in\r\nthe oven for ten minutes; then add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 cup\r\nof hot water, and baste every five minutes for half an hour. Make\r\na brown sauce in the same pan, or serve with Caper sauce. Garnish,\r\nif brown sauce is used, with English savoury croquettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAMED NUT AND BARLEY LOAF\r\n\r\nMake as in the foregoing recipe, but pack into a mould, set this\r\nin boiling water, and let it steam for an hour and a half or two\r\nhours. Let cool in the mould, and turn out to serve cold, or to slice,\r\nor to use for nut hash.\r\n\r\nA brick-shaped mould will be made by any tinsmith to order, or the\r\nlarge sizes of baking-powder tins can be used to steam loaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROASTED NUT LOAF WITH HOMINY\r\n\r\nGrind 2 cups of nuts,--pecans, walnuts, roasted peanuts, etc., or\r\nuse peanuts only,--and mix with them 2 cups of cold boiled hominy,\r\n1/2 cup of bread crumbs, 3 hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, 1 tablespoon\r\nof chopped parsley, 1 tablespoon of grated onion, and 1 raw egg. Form\r\ninto 1 large roll, or several smaller ones, put in a buttered tin,\r\nand let bake in a quick oven for half an hour; baste with a little\r\nbutter and water a few times. Garnish with slices of lemon, and serve\r\nwith brown sauce. This loaf may be steamed as directed for barley\r\nloaf and used hot, cold, or in hash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT AND FRUIT LOAF\r\n\r\nChop mixed nuts enough to make 2 cups, and add to them 6 bananas\r\nchopped fine and 1/2 teaspoon of salt; mix well together, and press\r\ninto a plain mould. Stand the mould in a steamer, and let it steam\r\nfor three hours. Serve ice-cold, sliced, with pickles or catsup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION LOAF\r\n\r\nThis loaf can be made and kept in readiness for use, as it will\r\nremain fresh for several days if it is left in the covered mould in\r\nwhich it cooked and is kept in a cool place. Put 2 cups of water in\r\na saucepan, and when the water boils stir into it 1 cup of a finely\r\nground cereal, preferably gluten flour or meal, or Scotch oatmeal,\r\nand stir until thick; then add 2 teaspoons of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of\r\npepper, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 1 cup of shelled peanuts which\r\nhave been put through a vegetable grinder twice. Pack the mixture\r\ninto a loaf-shaped mould, or large round tin with a tight-fitting lid,\r\nalmost immerse it in water, and let it steam for two hours. Use when\r\ncold, either for nut hash or croquettes, or with an equal amount of\r\nbread crumbs and the seasoning to make Michaelmas or Christmas loaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT HASH\r\n\r\nUse cold steamed nut loaf and the same amount of cold boiled\r\npotatoes. Chop the potatoes and the loaf separately, and add to them,\r\nafter mixing, 1/4 as much chopped onion. Turn into a frying pan which\r\ncontains melted butter well covering the bottom, dredge with salt and\r\npepper, and stir frequently with a knife during the first ten minutes'\r\nslow cooking; then let the hash brown on the bottom, shaking the pan\r\nvigorously from time to time, season afresh, and turn out with the\r\nbrowned portion on top. One or 2 chopped green peppers can be added\r\nto the hash, if the flavour is liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I say nothing of taking life--of fattening for that express\r\n    purpose; diseases of animals; bad blood made; cruelty\r\n    superinduced;--it will be seen to be, it will be looked\r\n    back on, as a form of, a second stage of cannibalism.\r\n\r\n                                                        George Meredith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE, MACARONI, Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILED RICE\r\n\r\nWash 1 cup of rice by letting water run through it in a sieve, and\r\nput it in a large double boiler, the top of which contains plenty\r\nof water at boiling point; add 1 teaspoon of salt, and let it boil,\r\ntightly covered, for twenty-five minutes; pour off the water then\r\nfrom the rice, still holding the cover on, and again place it over\r\nthe boiler, and let the rice steam for another twenty minutes, when\r\nit will be found that each grain is separate, as it should be. Use\r\na fork to scrape it lightly into the serving dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED RICE\r\n\r\nLet 1/2 cup of rice soak for several hours in 2 cups of warm\r\nwater. Drain and put in a baking dish, and cover with 3 cups of milk\r\ncontaining 1/2 a teaspoon of salt.

The instructions are to cover the saucepan\r\nclosely after putting the eggs in the water, and let it stand on the\r\nback of the stove, the eggs to be removed in ten minutes if wanted\r\nsoft, and in twenty minutes if liked well set. Hard-boiled eggs are\r\ncertainly more palatable cooked in this way than when boiled for ten\r\nminutes in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED EGGS\r\n\r\nPut a little butter into a small frying pan, and when melted break\r\nan egg into a saucer, and slide it carefully into the hot butter,\r\nand let it fry until the white is thoroughly set, cooking as many as\r\nare required, separately, in the same way. If a tight cover is put\r\nover the frying pan when the egg is put in, the yolk of the egg will\r\nbe as pink as a nicely poached egg when done. Season with pepper and\r\nsalt before serving. A little Worcestershire sauce or walnut catsup\r\nheated in the pan and poured over fried eggs adds variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOACHED EGGS\r\n\r\nFill a deep frying pan 2/3 full of hot water, and stir into it one\r\nteaspoon of vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt. When the water reaches\r\nboiling point break the eggs carefully one by one into it, remove the\r\npan from the intense heat, cover it, and let the eggs cook until the\r\nwhites are firmly set. If the water is shallow the eggs will spread\r\nand be more flat, in which case the boiling water must be dipped up\r\nover the yolks with a spoon to make them pink; if the water is deep\r\nthe eggs will be more round than flat. When the eggs are done lift\r\nthem carefully from the water with a perforated strainer in order to\r\ndrain off the water thoroughly, and serve them on hot toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOACHED EGGS WITH GRAVY\r\n\r\nPoach eggs and serve them with Sauce Bernaise, or any piquant sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOACHED EGGS INDIENNE\r\n\r\nPoach the number of eggs required, and after placing them on toast\r\npour over them a thin curry sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS WALDORF\r\n\r\nPlace nicely poached eggs on toast, and fit a freshly cooked mushroom\r\nas a cap over each yolk. Surround the toast with brown sauce containing\r\nquartered mushrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAMBLED EGGS\r\n\r\nBreak six or more into a bowl, beat them lightly with a fork, and\r\npour them into a frying pan into which 1 tablespoon of butter has been\r\nmelted; stir continually over a very slow fire until they are well set,\r\nseasoning them meanwhile with pepper and salt, and adding another\r\n1/2 tablespoon of butter in small pieces during the cooking. Serve\r\nwith a garnish of small triangular pieces of toast. One tablespoon of\r\ncream can be added to the eggs before serving if desired. Eggs may\r\nbe scrambled with milk, using 1/2 cup of milk to 4 eggs, and then\r\nproceeding as above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAMBLED EGGS WITH CHEESE\r\n\r\nMake plain scrambled eggs, and when nearly set add 2 tablespoons\r\nof grated cheese for every 6 eggs used, and 1 tablespoon of chopped\r\nparsley. Serve on toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAMBLED EGGS WITH MUSHROOMS, PEAS, ETC.\r\n\r\nScramble 6 eggs, and two or three minutes before removing from the\r\nfire add to them a can of button mushrooms cut in slices, lengthwise,\r\nand 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley. In the same way peas,\r\ntomatoes, asparagus tips, chopped sweet peppers, etc., can be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOURY SCRAMBLED EGGS\r\n\r\nPrepare plain scrambled eggs, and just before taking off the fire add\r\n2 tablespoons of chopped chives (or green stems of young onions or\r\nshallots can be used instead), and 1/2 a tablespoon of finely chopped\r\nparsley; serve on hot toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAMBLED EGGS INDIENNE\r\n\r\nMake plain scrambled eggs, and just before serving stir into them 1\r\ntablespoon of cream, into which has been stirred 1 teaspoon of curry\r\npowder and 1/2 teaspoon of onion juice. Serve on hot toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH EGGS\r\n\r\nFor 6 eggs use 1 large tomato and 1 small onion. Chop the onion fine,\r\nand fry it five minutes in 1 tablespoon of butter; then add the\r\nchopped tomato, and stir another minute over the fire. Now pour in\r\nthe eggs and scramble them, adding 1 teaspoon of salt and a saltspoon\r\nof pepper. Garnish with small triangles of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIRRED EGGS\r\n\r\nButter individual gratin dishes, and break into them 1 or 2 eggs as\r\ndesired. Season with salt and pepper, and a sprinkling of finely\r\nchopped parsley, and put into the oven for five minutes, or until\r\nthe eggs are set. Place each dish on a small plate with a paper doily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIRRED EGGS WITH TOMATOES\r\n\r\nUse as many shallow, individual gratin dishes as there are persons\r\nto be served, and, after buttering each dish, break into it 1 egg,\r\ntaking care not to break the yolk. Halve some small tomatoes, and\r\nset one half, cut side up, in each dish; season the whole with pepper\r\nand salt, and set in the oven for ten minutes or less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIDDLED EGGS\r\n\r\nHeat a griddle and butter it slightly, and break upon it 3 or 4 eggs,\r\ndisturbing the yolks so as to break them. When a little browned on\r\none side turn them with a cake-turner and fry the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAIN OMELET\r\n\r\nPut 3 or 4 eggs in a bowl and beat them ten or twelve times with a\r\nfork vigorously. Put 1 scant tablespoon of butter in a frying pan,\r\nand as soon as melted turn in the eggs and shake over a slow fire\r\nuntil they are set; season with salt and pepper, turn the omelet\r\ntogether as it is let to slide from the pan, and place on a hot\r\ndish. Make several small omelets rather than one large one, and place\r\non white paper doilies, and garnish with parsley to serve. The trick\r\nof shaking an omelet is the secret of making a good one, and the egg\r\nmixture should be not over 1/2 an inch deep in the pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOMELET SOUFFLÉ\r\n\r\nTake 4 to 6 fresh eggs, separate the yolks and whites, and beat each\r\nuntil as light as possible. Butter a deep frying pan, mix the yolks and\r\nwhites lightly together with a fork, and put in the hot frying pan,\r\nsmoothing somewhat with a fork to level. Season the top with pepper\r\nand salt, and shake over a slow fire until the omelet is delicately\r\nbrowned on the bottom; turn it together and serve on a hot platter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERB OMELET\r\n\r\nMake like plain omelet, stirring with every 4 eggs used 1 teaspoon\r\neach of powdered thyme, or sweet marjoram, sage, chopped onion tops\r\nor chives, and parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE OMELET\r\n\r\nFor omelet soufflé made with 6 eggs add 1/4 cup of grated cheese\r\nto the yolks of the eggs, and 1/4 cup to the beaten whites before\r\nputting them together.\r\n\r\nIn making plain omelet with cheese add 1/4 cup of cheese to 4 eggs\r\nafter they are in the omelet pan. Sprinkle with grated cheese to serve,\r\nand garnish with watercress or parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUM OMELET\r\n\r\nMake an omelet soufflé, put on a hot dish, and pour 1/2 cup of heated\r\nrum around it, and light it with a match. Rum is easily made to blaze\r\nif a teaspoon is filled with it and a lighted match held under the\r\ntip of the spoon. The rum on the platter can then be easily lighted\r\nwith that in the spoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED OMELET SOUFFLÉ\r\n\r\nBeat the whites of 6 eggs very stiff and the yolks of 3. Mix the whites\r\nand the yolks, using a fork; then stir in the juice of half a lemon\r\nand 3 tablespoons of powdered sugar.

Hard boil 6 or 8 eggs, then cut each carefully in two,\r\nlengthwise; remove the yolks and stir them into the spinach, mashing\r\nthem well, and mashing all together until the yolks are thoroughly\r\nmixed with the spinach; then season with salt and pepper and neatly\r\nfill the halves of the whites of the eggs with the spinach. Make a\r\nsauce with 2 cups of milk, 1 teaspoon of butter, and 2 tablespoons of\r\nflour, a dash of paprika, and 1 cup of grated cheese. When this has\r\nthickened arrange 2 or 3 halved eggs in each individual gratin dish,\r\nand pour around them some of the sauce, and set in the oven five\r\nminutes to make thoroughly hot, or serve on a large dish garnished\r\nwith small triangular pieces of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG WITH MASHED POTATO\r\n\r\nUse a long, narrow gratin dish, and arrange cold mashed potato in\r\nit in ridges with a spoon, and make three or four hollows in the\r\nsurface. Into each of these break an egg, and let all bake in the oven\r\nuntil the eggs are set. Tomato or white sauce can be served with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS NEWBURG\r\n\r\nHard boil 6 eggs, plunge them into cold water for a moment,\r\nthen peel, and when cooled, so they will not crumble in cutting,\r\ncut them in half.

Add to\r\nthis 1/2 cup of milk, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 saltspoon of\r\npepper, and let cook three or four minutes only. Pour into a deep\r\ngratin dish, and break upon it 6 eggs; sprinkle with 1/2 cup of bread\r\ncrumbs, and let cook in a moderate oven about five minutes, or until\r\nthe eggs are set. Serve in the same dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVILLED EGGS\r\n\r\nHard boil the number of eggs required, halve them, and serve on toast\r\nwith devilled sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE EGGS\r\n\r\nHard boil the number of eggs required, and, after halving them,\r\nremove the yolks, and mix them with a little butter (using 1\r\ntablespoon to 6 eggs), pepper, salt, and a little tomato chutney or\r\nHarvey sauce. Refill the halved whites with this, and use the eggs\r\nto garnish 2 cups of boiled rice.

Put 1 cup of milk in a\r\ndouble boiler, and when it boils add to it 1 tablespoon of butter and\r\n1 tablespoon of cornstarch which have been rubbed together, and when\r\nthe sauce has thickened season it generously with pepper and salt,\r\nand stir into it the chopped whites of the eggs. While the sauce is\r\ncooking prepare 5 rounds of toast, and place them on a hot dish. Cover\r\neach piece of toast with a layer of white sauce, sprinkle this with a\r\nlayer of the yolks, then more of the white sauce, and the remainder\r\nof the yolks, season with salt and pepper, and stand in the oven a\r\nmoment or two before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROTHED EGGS\r\n\r\nSeparate the yolks and whites of as many eggs as are required, putting\r\neach yolk in its shell or in a separate dish. Beat the whites until\r\nvery stiff, and fill a well-buttered custard cup half full of the\r\nwhite of egg; make a hole in the centre, sprinkle with salt, pepper,\r\nand lemon juice, and drop a yolk in each cup.

Put the\r\nyolks through a sieve, and rub to a paste with 1 tablespoon of melted\r\nbutter, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup of cream or milk, using a little\r\nat a time, so as not to use it all unless needed to make the mixture\r\nof the right consistency for refilling the halved whites. Carefully\r\nfill the places made vacant by the removed yolks, roll the half-egg\r\nin beaten egg and crumbs, and fry in deep, hot fat. Serve with 2 cups\r\nof white sauce, and add to it 2 tablespoons of diced pickled beets,\r\nwhich makes the sauce pink.\r\n\r\nThis same effect may be had to some extent by simply using hard-boiled\r\neggs, frying them, and serving with same sauce or white sauce, to\r\nwhich 1 tablespoon of capers has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWISS EGG TOAST\r\n\r\nMelt 1 tablespoon of butter on a shallow or flat dish, and sprinkle\r\nover it 1 1/2 tablespoons of grated cheese; then break into the butter\r\n3 eggs, taking care not to break the yolks.

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a\r\nsaucepan; when melted add 1 onion cut into thin slices, and stir it\r\nabout three or four minutes. Then add to it 1 tomato which has been\r\npeeled and chopped, 1 sweet green pepper cut in very thin slices,\r\neach broken in several pieces, and 1/2 can of button mushrooms,\r\nwhich are prepared by draining and washing and cutting lengthwise in\r\n3 or 4 pieces. Let all cook slowly together for eight or ten minutes,\r\nstirring carefully and adding more butter if necessary. When nearly\r\ncooked season generously with pepper and salt, add 1 tablespoon of\r\ntomato sauce, and when the eggs are removed from the oven place this\r\ngarnish on the eggs, encircling the outer edge. This garnish can be\r\nvaried as to quantities to suit taste, using more or less tomatoes\r\nor onions.

Stir over the fire\r\nfor one minute, then remove, and add salt and cayenne pepper, and\r\nthe lightly beaten yolks of 2 eggs; afterwards stir in with a fork\r\nthe whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Pour into ramekin\r\ndishes, and bake for fifteen minutes in a moderate oven, or cook and\r\nserve in a baking dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED CHEESE AND BREAD\r\n\r\nSoak 1 cup of bread crumbs for two or three minutes in 2 cups of\r\nmilk, then beat in the yolks of 2 eggs thoroughly beaten, and 1 cup\r\nof grated cheese, and lastly the whites of the 2 eggs beaten to a\r\nstiff froth. Put into a buttered baking dish, dot the top with butter,\r\nsprinkle with bread crumbs, and bake until a light brown, which will\r\nbe in from twenty minutes to half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE FONDU\r\n\r\nPut 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1 cup\r\nof milk, or cream if desired, 1 cup of fine bread crumbs, 2 cups of\r\ngrated cheese, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard,\r\nand some cayenne pepper. Stir constantly until well heated through,\r\nand then add 2 lightly beaten eggs, and serve on rounds of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE RELISH\r\n\r\nPut 1 cup of milk into a double boiler, season with pepper and salt,\r\nand when hot stir in 1 cup of grated cheese, and let cook for five\r\nminutes; then add 3 crumbed soda crackers and serve on toast, with\r\na sprinkling of paprika.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE MÉRINGUES\r\n\r\nBeat the whites of 2 eggs to a stiff froth, and stir into them with a\r\nfork 2 tablespoons of Parmesan or grated cheese, 2 drops of tabasco,\r\na little salt and paprika; drop 1 tablespoon at a time into hot fat,\r\nand fry until brown; then drain and sprinkle with fresh salt and\r\npaprika before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAMED CHEESE\r\n\r\nMake 2 cups of well-seasoned white sauce, add a few drops of golden\r\nyellow colouring, stir into it 1/2 cup of cheese cut into dice (or\r\ngrated if preferred), and when the cheese is softened and hot serve\r\non rounds of toast and sprinkle with paprika.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE PANCAKES\r\n\r\nMake small pancakes of 1 cup of milk, 1 egg, and enough flour to\r\nthicken, and spread them with grated cheese moistened with a little\r\nmelted butter; sprinkle chopped chives mixed with parsley over the\r\ncheese, and a dash of any savoury catsup (if liked), season with salt\r\nand pepper, roll the pancakes after cooking, and serve as a savoury\r\nor luncheon dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTAGE CHEESE\r\n\r\nTake 2 quarts or more of sour milk or cream, and add to it the same\r\nquantity of rapidly boiling water, turn into a straining-bag, and\r\nhang up until dry. When ready to use, turn out of the bag and rub\r\nuntil smooth; add a seasoning of salt and pepper and a little sweet\r\ncream. Beat until light and serve ice-cold. A little cream can be\r\nserved to eat upon it, if liked.\r\n\r\nThis can also be made by heating the sour milk or cream and using no\r\nwater, but the milk must only be heated enough to separate and not\r\nenough to boil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWELSH RAREBIT\r\n\r\nCut in very small thin pieces 1 pound of American cheese; put it in\r\na chafing-dish and stir until melted, then add 1 teaspoon of mustard,\r\nsome salt, and slowly stir in 1/2 a glass of beer or ale, and season\r\nwith cayenne or paprika just before serving on toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACHELOR'S RAREBIT\r\n\r\nMake Welsh rarebit, and five minutes before serving stir into it\r\n1 tablespoon of chopped green peppers and 1 tablespoon of chopped\r\nSpanish pimentos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDELMONICO RAREBIT\r\n\r\nCut in small pieces 1 pound of American cheese, put it in a\r\nchafing-dish and stir until melted; then add 1/2 a glass of beer or\r\nale, some salt and cayenne or paprika, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, the\r\nyolk of 1 egg, then the whipped white of the egg, and serve at once\r\non toast. The white of the egg militates against any \"stringiness\"\r\nwhich is apt to come from cooking certain sorts of cheese. A little\r\nmilk can be used, if desired, instead of beer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPINK RAREBIT\r\n\r\nDrain 1 can of tomatoes and put them in a saucepan with 1 tablespoon\r\nof butter; season them well with pepper and salt, and after they have\r\ncooked fifteen or twenty minutes add 1 pound of fresh American cheese\r\ncut into thin slices, and stir until melted; season generously with\r\nsalt and pepper, and serve on rounds of toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIPTAUER CHEESE\r\n\r\nRemove the paper from the smallest Neufchâtel cream cheese, which is\r\nnearer like real Liptauer than any other that can be had in America,\r\nand set it in the centre of a plate; surround it with 1 teaspoon of\r\npaprika, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, a small mustard spoon of French mustard,\r\na piece of fresh butter half the size of the cheese, 2 teaspoons\r\nof minced onion, and 1 teaspoon of capers. The \"Liptauer\" should\r\nbe blended at the table with a silver knife. Add first the butter,\r\nthen the capers, then the onion, then the seasoning, and make into\r\na cream. Serve on brown or white bread, or crackers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROQUEFORT CHEESE GOURMET\r\n\r\nCream 1/2 pound of Roquefort cheese with 1 tablespoon of butter and\r\nsome salt and 1 tablespoon of sherry, and serve on water crackers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMEMBERT CHEESE\r\n\r\nA pretty way to serve Camembert cheese is to place the cheese, when\r\nremoved from its box and paper, on a round paper doily on a large\r\nplate, and surround it with a heavy wreath of watercress and radishes\r\ncut to look like flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE \"DREAMS\"\r\n\r\nCut fresh cheese into thin slices, spread with made mustard, sprinkle\r\nwith paprika, lay between two trimmed slices of bread, and toast on\r\nboth sides until nicely browned, using a very slow fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRATED CHEESE\r\n\r\nInstead of throwing away bits of dried cheese these should be grated\r\nand put in a wide mouthed, covered glass jar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"If Plutarch's advice, that those who affirm that they were\r\n    intended by nature for a diet of flesh food, 'should\r\n    themselves kill what they wish to eat,' were always followed,\r\n    the question would to most take on a different aspect. Few\r\n    can endure unmoved the horrible sights of the slaughter-house;\r\n    far less could they participate in the slaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALADS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no end to the combinations of vegetables for salads; the\r\nfew here given are the best ones I have tried. The dressing should\r\nnever be put on a fresh green salad until just as it is to be used;\r\nother salads, like potato, beans, etc., are sometimes improved\r\nby standing. Lettuce for salads should be carefully looked over;\r\nand clean, inner leaves not washed unless they are muddy; but all\r\nthe leaves used which are washed should be thoroughly dried before\r\nadding the dressing. In France the salad basket is one of the most\r\nused kitchen utensils, and the salad leaves after washing are shaken\r\nin this until absolutely dry. The dressing should be very well mixed\r\nwith the vegetables, and a little dry salt and pepper added as the\r\nsalad is served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH DRESSING\r\n\r\nAn absolute rule for making good salad dressing is an almost impossible\r\nthing, as this seems to be the one place in cookery where it is not\r\nonly allowable but commendable to \"guess\" at proper proportions. The\r\nfollowing is as nearly accurate as it seems well to be. Put 1 scant\r\nteaspoon of salt and 1 saltspoon of black pepper in a bowl, and stir\r\ninto them with a wooden fork, very slowly, 3 or 4 tablespoons of fresh\r\noil, and then add half as much or less vinegar, mixing it well with\r\nthe oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTARRAGON VINEGAR\r\n\r\nGood tarragon vinegar can be bought in any city, but it is so easily\r\nprepared at home that it is worth doing. Put a handful of tarragon\r\nin a quart jar, and cover with cold or heated vinegar. Seal the jar\r\nand set it in a dark place for a month or so before using.\r\n\r\nMake chervil vinegar in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAIN MAYONNAISE DRESSING\r\n\r\nPut 2 chilled egg-yolks in a cold soup plate, and stir into them 1\r\nteaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of mustard, using a silvered spoon,\r\nand after these are well mixed in begin to add oil, actually drop by\r\ndrop, from 1 scant cup of cool olive oil, and do this until the eggs\r\nare so thickened that it is not possible to make them more so; then the\r\nremaining oil may be added less slowly. If this first process is not\r\nproperly done, no amount of stirring will ever thicken the sauce. A\r\nfork or whisk may be used to finish the stirring. When the oil is\r\nadded, beat in slowly 1 tablespoon of vinegar, and 1 of lemon juice,\r\nand 1/2 saltspoon of cayenne pepper. Put on the ice until wanted.\r\n\r\nTarragon mayonnaise is made by substituting tarragon vinegar for\r\nplain vinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN COLOURING FOR MAYONNAISE\r\n\r\nThis may be made of mixed herbs or spinach. If herbs are used take\r\n1 tablespoon of parsley, 1 of watercress, and 1 of chervil, put them\r\ninto boiling water, let them cook eight minutes, then drain and pound\r\nin a mortar, and press the pulp through a fine sieve. Use this with\r\nmayonnaise to make a light delicate green colour.\r\n\r\nIf spinach is used press 1 tablespoon of chopped spinach through a\r\nsieve, and use it to colour the sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALAD CHEESE BALLS\r\n\r\nUse equal quantities of Neufchâtel cheese and grated American (or\r\nParmesan) cheese, sprinkle with cayenne, and dampen with a little\r\nmelted butter. Shape into tiny balls and use very cold as a salad\r\ngarnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SALAD\r\n\r\nUse 1 cup of scraped thinly sliced celery, 1 cup of diced apples, 1/2\r\ncup of chopped English walnuts, and 1/2 cup of seeded white grapes. Mix\r\nwell with mayonnaise, and serve on large curled lettuce leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICHOKE SALAD\r\n\r\nUse cold boiled fresh artichokes, remove the thistles, and fill\r\nthe artichokes with finely minced chopped onion, apple, and beet,\r\nblended with green mayonnaise; serve extra mayonnaise in which to\r\ndip the artichoke leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN BEAN SALAD\r\n\r\nPut a can of good \"stringless\" beans on the ice an hour before wanted,\r\nopen, drain, and arrange in a salad bowl with 2 teaspoons of grated\r\nor finely chopped onion and 1 cup of French dressing. Serve ice-cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAX BEAN SALAD\r\n\r\nMake like the preceding, using 1 tablespoon of chopped chives or\r\nshallots, or green onion tops instead of chopped onion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEET SALAD WITH CELERY\r\n\r\nCut boiled beets in thin slices and use a vegetable cutter to cut\r\nthem into fancy shapes. Mix 1 cup of beets with 1 cup of thinly sliced\r\ncelery, cover well with mayonnaise, serve on lettuce leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE SALAD\r\n\r\nSlice firm white cabbage as thin as possible, then cut it across, mix\r\nit with mayonnaise dressing, and serve on small white cabbage leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY AND PINEAPPLE SALAD\r\n\r\nUse equal parts of thin strips of celery and shredded pineapple. Select\r\na perfectly ripe pineapple. Put the celery and pineapple each by\r\nitself, and place on the ice. When time to serve mix them together\r\nwith mayonnaise, garnish with celery leaves, and serve at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY SALAD\r\n\r\nWhen fresh cherries are available they are best, but the large cherries\r\nin glass bottles are also suitable. Remove the stones from fresh\r\ncherries, and in their places put blanched filberts or hazelnuts. Put\r\non curled lettuce leaves with a tablespoon of green mayonnaise on each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER SALAD\r\n\r\nSoak 2 unpeeled cucumbers in ice-cold water for twenty minutes or\r\nmore, then peel and use a patent scraper on the sides to serrate the\r\nedges, or do this by drawing a silver fork firmly down the length\r\nof the cucumber; this will make the slices have fancy edges. Slice,\r\nand arrange with small white lettuce leaves in a salad bowl. Cover\r\nwith French dressing and add a sprinkling of paprika to the salad\r\nitself before serving. Some sliced radishes may be added if liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY SALAD\r\n\r\nUse 1 cup each of finely sliced firm white cabbage, diced celery,\r\nand chopped apple; mix them well with mayonnaise dressing, and serve\r\nin the inner leaves from the cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN CUCUMBER SALAD\r\n\r\nPrepare like plain cucumber salad, but put with the sliced cucumbers\r\n1 small onion sliced thin, with the slices separated into rings. One\r\ntablespoon of chives may be added, or more chives used and the onion\r\nslices omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENT DE LION SALAD\r\n\r\nTake young dandelion leaves, trim off all the stem below the\r\nleaf, and mix with a French dressing to which has been added onion\r\njuice or chopped chives; use 1 tablespoon of either to each cup of\r\ndressing. Hard-boiled eggs, sliced or chopped, are sometimes used to\r\ngarnish this salad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPINK EGG SALAD\r\n\r\nBoil 6 or 8 eggs for ten minutes, put in cold water for two or three\r\nminutes, then peel and put in a jar of pickled beets, well covered\r\nwith vinegar. Let them stand a few hours and serve with the beets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDIVE SALAD\r\n\r\nWash heads of endive and use the crisp, white, light leaves. Shake\r\ndry and cover with French dressing. Add 1 teaspoon of minced onion\r\nbefore dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFETTICUS OR CORN SALAD\r\n\r\nWash 2 cups of fetticus and dry the leaves well, then cover with\r\nFrench dressing, and add 1 teaspoon of grated onion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN SALAD\r\n\r\nTake a handful of sorrel, 2 sprigs of chervil, 4 leaves of tarragon\r\n(or use tarragon vinegar), 1 teaspoon of chopped chives, and the\r\nsmall leaves from the heart of a head lettuce. Blend all well with\r\nFrench dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPE-FRUIT SALAD\r\n\r\nWash and shake dry the fine leaves from a head lettuce, and arrange\r\nwith them in layers very thin slices of grape-fruit; mix well with\r\nFrench dressing before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN SALAD\r\n\r\nHaving prepared 2 nice heads of head lettuce, arrange them in the\r\nsalad bowl with 2 seedless oranges which have been neatly peeled,\r\nand cut into thin slices with a very sharp knife. Season with salt and\r\npepper, and then mix thoroughly with French dressing. The oranges and\r\nlettuce should have been chilled so that the salad will be very cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTUCE SALAD\r\n\r\nPull apart a fresh head lettuce, breaking the leaves neatly from the\r\nstalk, and wash those that need it and shake them dry. Put in a salad\r\nbowl with French dressing or sauce vinaigrette, and mix well together\r\nbefore serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACEDOINE SALAD\r\n\r\nOpen a glass or can of imported macedoine of vegetables, drain, and\r\ncover with French dressing. Arrange with lettuce leaves in a bowl or\r\non separate plates. Freshness can be added by a tablespoon of chopped\r\nchives, or shallots, or parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MIXED SALAD\r\n\r\nUse 1 cup of chopped tomato, 1 cup of chopped cucumber, 1/2 cup of\r\nthinly sliced radishes, 1/2 cup of chopped apple, and 2 tablespoons\r\nof the German pearl pickled onions. Mix all together with 1 cup of\r\nmayonnaise, and arrange in a salad bowl with lettuce leaves, which\r\nshould be used to hold the salad in serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM SALAD\r\n\r\nSelect fresh, firm mushrooms that are small, wash them carefully\r\nwithout peeling, and stir them in French dressing that contains\r\nrather more oil than usual. Put 1 crisp lettuce leaf on each plate,\r\nfill it with the mushrooms, sprinkle with salt and a little paprika,\r\nand serve very cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRAGANSETT SALAD\r\n\r\nWash and shake dry the fine white centre of endive or chicory,\r\nand arrange with it quartered tomatoes from which the skin has been\r\nremoved; serve with a French dressing to which a tablespoon of chopped\r\nparsley, 1/2 teaspoon of chopped onion, and 1 finely chopped egg has\r\nbeen added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA SALAD\r\n\r\nSelect large tomatoes, remove the skins by putting in boiling\r\nwater, cut out the inside, and refill with finely chopped pineapple,\r\ncelery, and apple in equal proportions, all well blended with plain\r\nmayonnaise. Serve on lettuce leaves on separate plates, or use\r\nwatercress instead of lettuce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIMENTO SALAD WITH CHEESE BALLS\r\n\r\nMix 2 Neufchâtel cheeses with 1 cup of grated cheese, and when creamed\r\ntogether add 6 olives stoned and chopped fine and 1 teaspoon of\r\nchopped pimento; season generously with salt and pepper, moisten with\r\ncream, and mould into balls an inch and a quarter through. Pimolas\r\n(which are olives stuffed with pimentos) can of course be used if\r\nmore convenient, and a few drops of onion extract or a very little\r\nonion juice adds piquancy to the cheese balls. Take lettuce which has\r\nbeen in cold water and is therefore crisp, shake it dry, and arrange\r\nwith it pimentos cut in long half-inch strips, mix thoroughly with\r\na French dressing, and garnish with the cheese balls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLISH SALAD\r\n\r\nUse boiled beets, sliced and mixed with French dressing, and over\r\nall sprinkle chopped white of hard-boiled egg.\r\n\r\nA little grated horse-radish is sometimes used with good effect in\r\nbeet salad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN POTATO SALAD\r\n\r\nBoil 6 medium-sized potatoes, and after draining shake them over\r\nthe fire a moment or two to dry; then peel and slice while warm, and\r\ncover at once with a dressing made of 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon\r\nof black pepper, 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, 1 chopped onion,\r\n5 tablespoons of oil, and 3 tablespoons of vinegar. Mix and let stand\r\non ice for an hour or so, then put with crisp lettuce leaves in a\r\nsalad bowl, and garnish with chopped boiled or pickled beets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN POTATO SALAD\r\n\r\nMix cold sliced boiled potatoes with mayonnaise dressing and add 1\r\ntablespoon of capers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED POTATO SALAD\r\n\r\nUse equal quantities of boiled beets (canned ones are convenient)\r\nand boiled potatoes. Dice both and mix well together, adding 1\r\ntablespoon of vinegar. Let stand until the potatoes are reddened,\r\nthen add 1 tablespoon of grated onion, mix well with French dressing,\r\nand garnish with slices of hard-boiled egg. Place in a salad bowl,\r\nwith fine white cabbage or crisp lettuce leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAINE SALAD\r\n\r\nPick over crisp heads of romaine, let stand a few minutes in cold\r\nwater, then shake until dry, and serve with French dressing to which\r\ngrated onion is added, using 1 teaspoon of it to each cup of dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN SALAD\r\n\r\nTo 2 cups of cold boiled rice add 2 chopped hard-boiled eggs and\r\nblend well with mayonnaise. Arrange on crisp lettuce leaves with a\r\ngarnish of egg slices, and beet, and sliced olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSORREL SALAD\r\n\r\nA refreshing salad may be made from the sorrel found growing wild. Wash\r\nit well, cut the stalks off, and dredge with salt, pepper, celery\r\nsalt, and then mix with oil, and sprinkle well with tarragon vinegar\r\nand a little grated onion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH SALAD\r\n\r\nRemove the skins from large, solid tomatoes and 1 small cucumber,\r\ntake the seeds from 1 small sweet green pepper, pare 1 small Spanish\r\nonion, and cut all in slices, making the peppers extremely thin. Mix\r\nwith 1 tablespoon of chopped nasturtium leaves or stems or seeds,\r\nand cover with French dressing, mixing well. Let stand on ice an hour\r\nbefore serving. Serve with cheese balls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY-NIGHT SALAD\r\n\r\nWash 1 large head of crisp head lettuce, separate the leaves, rejecting\r\nall but perfect ones, and shake them dry. Put them in a large salad\r\nbowl, and with them put 1 onion chopped very fine, 5 sliced tomatoes,\r\nand the leaves from 3 or 4 sprigs of watercress. At the table dredge\r\nthe salad generously with salt, and sprinkle with black pepper,\r\ncovering the entire surface; then pour from an oil bottle 3 or 4\r\ntablespoons of oil over the vegetables slowly, and follow this with\r\nabout 2 tablespoons of vinegar; add 1 tablespoon of tarragon vinegar,\r\nthen dredge with celery salt, and add a little cayenne, and mix all\r\ntogether with a wooden fork and spoon, turning the whole mass over\r\nand over ten or more times. The bowl may be well rubbed with garlic\r\nand the onion omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN TOMATO SALAD\r\n\r\nSlice 5 or 6 very small tomatoes, and put with them 2 onions sliced\r\nand divided into rings. Cover with French dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLICED TOMATO WITH CHIVES\r\n\r\nSlice 4 tomatoes, put with them 3 tablespoons of chopped chives,\r\nand cover with French dressing. Serve on lettuce leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALDORF SALAD\r\n\r\nUse 1 cup of shelled walnuts, broken or chopped, 1 cup of diced tart\r\napple, 1 cup of crisp celery cut in small pieces, and mix well with\r\nmayonnaise dressing. Serve on curly lettuce leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERCRESS SALAD WITH ORANGES\r\n\r\nCut two inches off the bottom of a bunch of watercress with a sharp\r\nknife, wash the cress thoroughly in ice-cold water, drain, and arrange\r\nin a salad bowl with 3 seedless oranges cut in thin slices, and mix\r\nall together with a dressing made of 1 tablespoon each of tarragon\r\nvinegar, olive oil, and brandy; season well with salt and pepper,\r\nand serve very cold.\r\n\r\nGrape fruit can be substituted for the orange, or equal amounts of\r\norange and grape fruit used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOKOHAMA SALAD\r\n\r\nCut into small cubes 2 fresh cucumbers that have been on ice until\r\nchilled and then peeled, and put with them 1 diced sour apple, 1\r\ntablespoon of shredded pimentos, 1 small bunch of watercress (using\r\nthe leaves only), and 2 tablespoons of chopped mint leaves. Mix with\r\nFrench dressing and serve on lettuce leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SALAD SUPPER\r\n\r\nUse large dinner plates, and on each arrange 6 of the large light\r\ngreen leaves from the inner part of head lettuce, putting 5 of them\r\nwith the stalk-end toward the centre of the plate, and another small\r\none in the centre. Fill the centre leaf with radishes (cut like roses)\r\nand olives, and fill the others as follows: In one put 2 tablespoons\r\nof canned green beans, well mixed, before putting on the leaf, with\r\na little grated onion and French dressing, on the second put 3 or 4\r\nslices of tomato and 2 teaspoons of mayonnaise, on the third arrange 3\r\nstalks of canned asparagus (white preferred) dipped in French dressing\r\nand sprinkled with chopped chives, on the fourth put 2 half-lengths of\r\na quartered cucumber to be dipped in salt in eating, and on the fifth\r\nput 1 tablespoon of tiny German pearl onions, 2 pickled walnuts, and\r\n2 gherkins. Serve nut or plain bread, or creamed cheese sandwiches, or\r\nall three. This supper may be varied in many ways; one is to use potato\r\nsalad or beet and egg instead of the beans. This as it stands was the\r\nresult of an emergency when six persons were suddenly to be served\r\nto a late supper and no preparation made. A well-stocked store-room\r\nof preserved goods and a small kitchen garden filled the need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            No flocks that range the valley free,\r\n              To slaughter I condemn;\r\n            Taught by the power that pities me,\r\n              I learn to pity them.\r\n\r\n                                        Oliver Goldsmith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe savoury begins a meal well, and is a convenient dainty for late\r\nsuppers. The variety is practically endless, and those given here\r\nmay be altered and added to indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH MUSHROOM \"COCKTAILS\"\r\n\r\nPut a small handleless cup or glass in the centre of a plate and\r\nencircle it with 6 of the smallest white leaves of lettuce. On\r\neach leaf place 2 small white firm button mushrooms, which have\r\nbeen freshly gathered and carefully washed but not peeled. Fill\r\nthe cocktail glass three quarters full of sauce made of 1/2 cup of\r\ntomato chutney, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 2 drops of tabasco (more\r\nif liked very hot), and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Set the plates in the\r\nrefrigerator for half an hour. Deliciously prepared \"Cocktail\" sauce\r\ncan be purchased in bottles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED MUSHROOM \"COCKTAILS\"\r\n\r\nIn each cocktail glass put 8 or 10 button mushrooms, and cover them\r\nwell with the cocktail sauce. Or use canned cêpes and serve in green\r\npepper cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIMENTO \"COCKTAILS\"\r\n\r\nCut squares, an inch across, from sweet pimentos (canned), and put\r\n8 or 10 of these in each glass; cover well with cocktail sauce and\r\nserve ice-cold, with celery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEET SAVOURY\r\n\r\nUse 1 large pickled beet and arrange neat slices on squares of bread;\r\nin the centre of the beet put a ring of hard-boiled sliced egg, filled\r\nwith the riced egg-yolk, and fill each corner with chopped chives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEET AND EGG SAVOURY\r\n\r\nChop equal parts of pickled beet and the whites of hard-boiled eggs\r\ntogether, and arrange on toast or bread with the riced yolks of the\r\neggs, mixed with a little chopped chives or parsley, in a cone on\r\nthe centre. Season well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN-BREAD SAVOURY\r\n\r\nCut brown bread into shapes, spread with butter, then heavily with\r\ncream cheese containing some salt, and cross two evenly cut strips of\r\npimento on each piece of bread thus prepared. At the juncture of the\r\nstrips of pimento place a slice of pimola, and put one in each space on\r\nthe cheese. Sprinkle with paprika, and put a few capers here and there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER SAVOURY\r\n\r\nCut bread in rounds and arrange on it neat slices of cucumber, the\r\nedges serrated before slicing by drawing a silver fork lengthwise of\r\nthe cucumber. Sprinkle with salt and paprika, and on each slice put\r\na ring from a small sliced onion, or arrange instead the tiny German\r\npearl pickled onions between the slices of cucumber. Sprinkle a little\r\nlemon juice over to serve. A variation is made by using chopped chives\r\nonly, or each ring of onion may be filled with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREOLE SAVOURY\r\n\r\nToast one side of shaped pieces of bread, and butter the untoasted\r\nside, and on it spread a layer of chopped tomato mixed with half as\r\nmuch chopped green pepper and some salt. Put in the oven or under\r\nthe gas flame for five minutes, and upon removing arrange a cone of\r\nfinely chopped onion in the centre of each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG SAVOURY\r\n\r\nUse fresh bread slightly toasted or less soft bread without\r\ntoasting. Cut in squares, diamonds, or rounds, and sprinkle with\r\nWorcestershire sauce, or any good sauce, then cover neatly with the\r\nchopped whites of hard-boiled, well-salted eggs, on which arrange\r\na centre of the riced yolks. Put a round slice from a black pickled\r\nwalnut on each corner, dot with capers, and sprinkle with paprika.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE-RADISH SAVOURY\r\n\r\nSpread oblong pieces of bread thinly with mustard, cover with a layer\r\nof chopped whites of hard-boiled eggs mixed with a little grated\r\nhorse-radish, arrange capers in strips crosswise of the bread, and\r\nbetween these sprinkle the hard-boiled yolks of the eggs which have\r\nbeen riced or pressed through a sieve. At the corners and in the\r\ncentre place thin slices of gherkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD SAVOURY\r\n\r\nCut shaped pieces of bread and spread with made mustard. Cover\r\nthem with chopped hard-boiled eggs mixed with a little chopped\r\nchives. Arrange capers in lines or any pattern on this. Season well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUFCHÂTEL SAVOURY\r\n\r\nMix Neufchâtel cheese with 1/4 as much butter and rub to a cream,\r\nand then squeeze through a tube onto salted, hot crackers, forming\r\nstar-like rosettes. Sprinkle with paprika, garnish with capers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONION SAVOURY\r\n\r\nUse shaped pieces of bread and spread thinly with butter, then arrange\r\na quarter-inch layer of finely minced Spanish onion mixed with chopped\r\nparsley and slightly dampened with tomato sauce; put in the centre of\r\neach the ring of a slice of hard-boiled egg, with a slice of pickled\r\nwalnut fitted into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLE SAVOURY\r\n\r\nSpread any savoury sauce and then cream cheese on oblong pieces of\r\nbread, and arrange on this thin slices of small sour pickles in a\r\nneat row, lengthwise. Sprinkle with paprika.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUFFED OLIVE SAVOURY\r\n\r\nArrange on squares of bread spread with tomato or any tart sauce\r\nstrips of riced yolk of hard-boiled egg; form squares by placing\r\nthem both ways of the bread, and in each put a ring of the white of\r\nhard-boiled egg sliced, and fill the centre with a slice of pimola\r\nor any other stuffed olive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPER SAVOURY\r\n\r\nMake same as the above using capers to fill the egg rings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO MAYONNAISE SAVOURY\r\n\r\nChop tomatoes and mix with them a thick mayonnaise, either plain or\r\nflavoured with herbs. Spread on shaped pieces of bread, and garnish\r\nwith thin rings sliced from green peppers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO SAVOURY\r\n\r\nCut rounds of bread the size of the tomatoes to be used and toast\r\none side; then butter the other side and arrange on each a slice\r\nof tomato, dredge with salt, pepper, and dry mustard, sprinkle with\r\nmushroom catsup or walnut catsup, and set under the burners of a gas\r\nstove for five minutes or until heated but not softened. Garnish with\r\nwatercress to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIPTAUER SAVOURY\r\n\r\nSpread shaped pieces of bread with \"Liptauer cheese\" and garnish with\r\nslices of pickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET PIMENTO SAVOURY\r\n\r\nToast fresh bread slightly, cut into shapes and butter one side, and\r\non this arrange a trimmed piece of canned Spanish pimento sprinkled\r\nwith celery salt, and set under the gas flame of a gas stove for five\r\nminutes to heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUNDS OF TOAST\r\n\r\nTo make rounds of bread or toast take an empty tin the size required\r\nand press it firmly into a slice of bread, thus cutting the round\r\nevenly and neatly.\r\n\r\nCutters for cutting vegetables into fancy shapes are convenient\r\nfor savouries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    One farmer said to me, \"You cannot live on vegetable food,\r\n    for it furnishes nothing to make bones with;\" and so he\r\n    religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his\r\n    system with the raw material of bones, walking all the\r\n    while he talks, behind his oxen, who, with vegetable made\r\n    bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of\r\n    obstacles.\r\n\r\n    I have found repeatedly of late years that I cannot fish\r\n    without falling a little in self-respect.\r\n\r\n                                                    Henry David Thoreau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDWICHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recipes given under Savouries can also be used in making\r\nsandwiches, and originality can have full play here as in the making\r\nof dainty and appetising savouries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVOURY BUTTER SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nUse unsalted or slightly salted butter, and with a silver knife press\r\ninto it any flavour desired,--onion juice, paprika, various sauces,\r\nchopped peppers, or capers,--using 1 teaspoon of minced herbs, etc.,\r\nto each tablespoon of butter. Spread in sandwiches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE HOUSE CLUB SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nCut fresh bread in medium thick slices, trim the four edges, and butter\r\nit with butter somewhat softened by warmth. On one side of two slices\r\nwhich belong next to each other put thinly sliced peeled tomatoes,\r\nfilling in bits to cover the bread neatly. Press 4 or 5 slices cut\r\nfrom pickled walnuts into the juicy parts of the tomatoes, lay 6 or 7\r\ncapers also in, and use half a teaspoon of the tiny German pearl onion\r\npickles to each sandwich. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and celery salt,\r\nand spread with mayonnaise. Press the other piece of bread firmly on,\r\nand wrap in waxed paper for picnics.\r\n\r\nVary with chopped chives, tarragon leaves, French dressing, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nArrange thinly sliced, cored apples between layers of buttered bread\r\nfrom which the crust has been cut. Sprinkle with salt and spread with\r\nmayonnaise, into which a few chopped nuts have been mixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREOLE SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nTrim and butter squares of bread and fit to them thinly sliced\r\ntomatoes, and spread with thin mustard; slice green peppers very thin,\r\nand arrange sections of the rings here and there over the tomatoes. Use\r\na little minced chives or shallot, or onions, and season with salt\r\nand pepper and lemon juice or some sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBAY SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nSpread squares of bread with curry paste, and cover with chopped\r\ntomato to which is added a little chopped onion and the same amount\r\nof chopped sour apples. Season with salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEANUT-BUTTER SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nSpread small oblong pieces of bread, from which the crust is cut,\r\nwith peanut butter blended with cream, and press firmly together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nBreak 2 eggs into a frying pan containing a little melted butter and\r\nlet them spread, breaking the yolk with a spoon after they are in the\r\npan; let them fry until the edges begin to brown, then season with\r\nsalt and pepper, and sprinkle with chopped chives. Cut pieces out to\r\nfit the bread slices to be used, and, after trimming and buttering\r\nthe bread, arrange them on one side of the sandwich. Use with no\r\nother flavouring, or sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce, or spread\r\nwith mustard. Wrap in waxed paper for picnics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nMix chopped nuts in thick cream or mayonnaise, and spread between\r\nslices of bread, either with or without a lettuce leaf. Sprinkle\r\nwith cayenne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTUCE SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nSpread oblong slices of trimmed bread with butter, lay a lettuce leaf\r\nbetween, trimmed to size, and spread with plain or green mayonnaise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIMOLA SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nButter small squares of bread and arrange on them sliced pimolas or any\r\nstuffed olives, sprinkle with lemon juice, or spread with mayonnaise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLE SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nSlice large pickles and arrange them between buttered bread slices. If\r\nGerman Dill pickles are used and German flavours liked sprinkle with\r\ncaraway seeds, and use rye bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nCut American or Swiss cheese very thin, spread with mustard, and\r\nplace a piece, trimmed to the size of the bread used, between two\r\npieces of buttered white or rye bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nUse rye or \"black\" bread, with caraway seeds baked in it, spread the\r\ntwo slices with unsalted butter, and on one arrange thin slices of\r\nSwiss cheese; spread this with German or French mustard, and arrange\r\non it 2 or 3 slices of Dill pickles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONOLULU SANDWICHES\r\n\r\nPare and core 3 apples, stem and seed 2 sweet green peppers, and put\r\nthem through a vegetable mill. Mix them into 2 Neufchâtel cheeses,\r\nand use as filling for brown or white bread sandwiches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            He prayeth well who loveth well\r\n            Both man and bird and beast;\r\n            He prayeth best who loveth best\r\n            All things both great and small;\r\n            For the dear God who loveth us,\r\n            He made and loveth all.\r\n\r\n                                        Coleridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTRY, PATTY CASES, Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIE-CRUST\r\n\r\nShortened pie-crust is made by using for one pie 2/3 of a cup of flour,\r\nwith 1/3 of a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt\r\nin it. Sift this onto 1/2 a cup of cocoanut butter or 1/2 a cup of\r\nbutter, or these two in equal proportions, dampen with ice-water,\r\nand roll out five or six times. Keep ice-cold until used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEASY PUFF PASTE\r\n\r\nUse a chopping bowl for mixing the paste, and into it put 4 cups of\r\nflour (sifted), 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt, adding\r\nit a spoonful at a time. Use 2 cups of butter, chopping it into the\r\nflour until it is as fine as possible. Beat 2 eggs for five minutes\r\nand add to them the juice of one lemon and 1/2 cup of very cold water,\r\nand stir this gradually into the paste. When mixed lift the paste\r\nto a well-floured pastry board, roll it into a rectangular shape,\r\nfold it over onto itself from the four sides, then roll again, and\r\nrepeat this process four times. Now fold into a thin piece of linen,\r\nand place on a plate near the ice in the refrigerator, and let it stand\r\nhalf an hour or more. Roll out again and use for patties, or pie-crust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMBALE CASES\r\n\r\nMake a batter of 3/4 of a cup of flour, 1/2 cup of milk in which 1\r\negg has been beaten, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 saltspoon of salt, and\r\nat the very last add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Dip the timbale iron\r\nin the batter, then in hot vegetable fat, taking care it does not\r\ntouch the bottom of the pan. When a golden brown remove and place on\r\npaper to drain, and proceed thus until a sufficient number has been\r\nmade. Fill with chestnuts, mushrooms, etc., in sauce, and reheat in\r\nthe oven after filling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTER FOR FRITTERS\r\n\r\nMake as for timbale cases and dip the vegetables or fruit to be fried\r\nin it, and fry until golden brown in hot fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTRY FOR PATTY PANS OR CASES\r\n\r\nInstead of frying-batter for timbale cases a paste can be made with 1\r\n1/2 cups of flour, 1 egg-yolk, and 3 tablespoons of butter well-mixed\r\nand dampened to the proper consistency by using perhaps 1/2 cup of\r\ncold water. Roll out very thin, about 1/16 of an inch, and press into\r\nthe small pans or moulds after buttering them. Trim neatly, and press\r\na little cup of buttered tissue paper in each, fill this with rice to\r\nprotect the inside from too much heat and to keep flat on the bottom,\r\nand bake in a rather slow oven. Do not turn out until cooled, and do\r\nnot fill until wanted.\r\n\r\nOrdinary pastry may be used also to line moulds for patty cases,\r\ntimbales, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO CRUST\r\n\r\nBoil good-sized potatoes with the skins on, peel while hot, and press\r\nthrough a ricer or sieve, mix with an equal quantity of white flour\r\nor whole wheat flour and a little salt, and dampen with cream. Press\r\ntogether and roll out for top crust of vegetable pies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESSEX PASTRY\r\n\r\nMix equal parts of mashed potato and flour pastry, and use baked in\r\nsmall squares as a garnish, or as a covering for deep vegetable pie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUMPLINGS\r\n\r\nSift 2 cups of flour, add to it 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder\r\nand 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and sift again. Stir into this 1 scant cup\r\nof milk, or just enough to make a dough that can scarcely be handled\r\nwithout sticking to the fingers. Drop in boiling vegetable stock or\r\ninto a stew and let boil rapidly ten minutes, taking great care not\r\nto uncover the kettle until just as the dumplings are removed. Serve\r\nat once in the stew or with brown sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROUTONS\r\n\r\nCut slices 1/4 of an inch thick of stale bread, and with a knife cut\r\nacross both ways to make tiny squares. Dry a few moments, then toss\r\nin a little hot butter to brown and serve warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD CRUMBS\r\n\r\nA jar of bread crumbs should always be kept on hand. Use stale bread,\r\nbreak it into bits, and brown it slightly in the oven. Then with a\r\nroller, or in a mortar, crumble it and crush it to powdered crumbs. If\r\na jar of light crumbs and one of golden brown crumbs are kept ready,\r\nthey will be found most convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            A small unkindness is a great offence.\r\n\r\n                                                Hannah More.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW HOT BREADS\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKING POWDER BISCUITS\r\n\r\nTake 2 tablespoons of butter and sift onto them lightly 2 cups of\r\nflour in which 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder is mixed, and\r\nwith freshly washed, cool hands mix the flour and butter thoroughly\r\ntogether, then pour on slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon, 1 cup\r\nof milk; with most flours this cup of milk or a very little less\r\nwill make the biscuit dough of the proper consistency, but if too\r\nthin or too thick, judgment must be used, as the dough should be so\r\nthat with well-floured hands it can scarcely be handled, but can with\r\nrapid motions be made into a roll which will keep its shape when put\r\non a well-floured bread board. It should then be rolled lightly with\r\na roller to the thickness of three quarters of an inch, and with a\r\nbiscuit cutter, the edge of which should be dipped in flour before\r\nusing, cut the rounds quickly out and place them at once in a shallow\r\nbuttered pan and set in the oven. They should be properly cooked in\r\neighteen or twenty minutes. The smallest sized baking powder tin is\r\nexactly the right size for a biscuit cutter.\r\n\r\nThis same recipe makes dumplings, strawberry short-cake, and the top\r\nof vegetable pies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOP OVERS\r\n\r\nMix 1 saltspoon of salt with 1 cup of flour, and add slowly enough\r\nfrom 1 cup of milk to just make a smooth paste; stir this well, then\r\nadd the remaining milk and the beaten yolk of 1 egg, and then the\r\nwhite whisked to a stiff froth. Put the batter in buttered gem pans\r\nor earthenware cups, and cook in the oven about twenty-five minutes,\r\nor until browned and standing very high. Serve at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAHAM GEMS\r\n\r\nMix 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon\r\nof sugar, and stir onto this 1 cup of milk containing the beaten\r\nyolks of 2 eggs, then add the beaten whites of the eggs, and put in\r\nhot buttered gem pans. Bake about twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE CORN BREAD\r\n\r\nBeat 2 eggs in a mixing bowl, add 1 heaping teaspoon of granulated\r\nsugar, and 1 cup of milk; mix 1/2 cup of white flour, 1 cup of yellow\r\ncorn meal, and 3 teaspoons of baking powder, and sift these into the\r\nmilk, stirring constantly. The batter should be thin enough to spread\r\nreadily when poured into the inch-deep baking pan. Just before pouring\r\nin the batter put 1 tablespoon of butter in the baking tin and when\r\nit melts, stir the batter into it; this is the secret of crisp brown\r\nbottom crust and was learned from an old negro cook. Bake twenty\r\nminutes to half an hour or until tinged with brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN RICE MUFFINS\r\n\r\nWith 1 cup of boiled rice put 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter,\r\nthe beaten yolks of 2 eggs, 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 tablespoon\r\nof sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 heaping teaspoon of baking\r\npowder. After mixing well add the well-beaten whites of the eggs,\r\npour into hot buttered gem pans, and bake in a quick oven from twenty\r\nto twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE GRIDDLECAKES\r\n\r\nMix well together 2 eggs, 2 cups of milk, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1\r\ntablespoon of sugar, 2 cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder,\r\nand 1 1/2 cups of boiled rice. Bake on a hot buttered griddle,\r\nbrowning both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN CAKES\r\n\r\nIn 1 1/2 cups of sour milk put 1 teaspoon of soda, 1 beaten egg,\r\n1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 scant 1/2 cup of white\r\nflour, and thicken with enough yellow corn meal to make a thin\r\nbatter. Fry a golden brown on a hot buttered griddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT CAKES\r\n\r\nBeat 2 eggs lightly and pour over them 2 cups of milk; mix 2 teaspoons\r\nof baking powder with 2 cups of flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt,\r\nand sift lightly into the milk, stirring constantly. Cook in small\r\npancakes on a hot buttered griddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGINGERBREAD\r\n\r\nBeat the yolks of 2 eggs lightly, melt 1/2 cup of butter and add to\r\nthe eggs, then stir in 1/2 cup of milk, 1 teaspoon of soda, and 1\r\n1/2 cups of dark molasses. Then add slowly 3 cups of sifted flour and\r\n1 tablespoon of ginger, and after beating the whites of the eggs to\r\na stiff froth stir them in with a fork. Bake in an inch-deep baking\r\npan in a slow oven for three quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY MORNING WAFFLES\r\n\r\nBeat 2 eggs thoroughly, and add to them 2 cups of milk and 1 saltspoon\r\nof salt, and sift into the milk 2 cups of flour containing 2 heaping\r\nteaspoons of baking powder, stirring constantly. Some flour thickens\r\nmore than others, and if more must be added sift it before stirring\r\nin. The secret of the excellence of waffles is not getting the batter\r\ntoo thick; it must spread readily when put upon the iron but not\r\nrun. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter and put it in the batter at the\r\nlast moment. Butter the hot waffle iron, using a bristle brush an\r\ninch or so wide for the purpose, over half-fill the iron with batter\r\n(using a large spoon), let one side brown, and then turn, to brown\r\nthe other.

Put in a pudding basin and steam or boil for eight\r\nhours; boil several hours to reheat the day it is to be used. Serve\r\nwith brandy sauce and nun's butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUM PUDDING SAUCE\r\n\r\nBeat 1 egg until very light, stir into it 1 cup of sugar, and when\r\nblended add 3 tablespoons of boiling water and cook over boiling\r\nwater for five minutes, adding 1 wineglass of brandy during the last\r\ntwo minutes' cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUN'S BUTTER\r\n\r\nBeat 1/2 cup of butter until creamy, and add slowly to it 1 cup of\r\npowdered (or granulated) sugar. Add 1 tablespoon of vanilla, lemon,\r\nor brandy, and a sprinkling of grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINCE PIE\r\n\r\nBake 3 large apples, and press them through a sieve to remove skins\r\nand cores; grate the rinds from 3 lemons, and add this and the juice\r\nof the lemons to the apple pulp; wash, pick over, and bruise in a\r\nmortar 1 cup of currants; stone 2 cups of raisins, and cut them\r\nin slices. Mix these all well together, chop into them 1 cup of\r\nbutter (or cocoanut butter), a little salt, 4 cups of brown sugar,\r\n1 tablespoon of candied lemon peel, 1 tablespoon of candied citron,\r\nand 1 tablespoon of candied orange peel, all well minced, and after\r\nstirring well, add 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade and 1/2 cup of\r\ngood brandy. Put in sealed glass jars, cover with wax or brandied\r\npaper before the jar is closed, and use for pies in two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Wilt thou draw near the Nature of the gods?

not always worth the space devoted to\r\nthem, but as the beginner in Vegetarianism often finds the arranging\r\nof a menu in such a way that it does not depart too far from the\r\naccustomed manner of serving food the most difficult part of the\r\ntask she has set herself, a few menus are here given, more with an\r\nidea of showing what dishes are most suitable as Entremets, Piecès\r\nde Resistance, and Entrées, than with the thought that they will be\r\nfollowed absolutely, for they can of course be changed in many ways,\r\nand very much simplified for ordinary use, and amplified for formal\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANKSGIVING DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\n                        FRESH MUSHROOM COCKTAIL\r\n\r\n                          PIMOLAS      CELERY\r\n\r\n
