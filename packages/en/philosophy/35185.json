The Theosophical Society is to be congratulated on securing so\r\ncompetent and sympathetic a translator and on publishing it in a popular\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe _Dhammapada_ is a part of the _Khuddaka Nikāya_ of the Buddhistic\r\nCanon and consists of about 420 stanzas in the _sloka_ metre. Every\r\nfully ordained _bhikkhu_[1] is expected to know the book by heart, and\r\nits verses are often on the lips of pious laymen. The beginner of\r\nBuddhist studies can have no better introduction to Buddhism and must go\r\nback to it again and again to enter into the spirit of Buddha and his\r\napostles.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures of the Buddhist Canon are known collectively as the\r\n_Ti-piṭaka_ (Sansk. _Tri-piṭaka_), \"the Three Baskets or\r\nTreasuries\". These divisions correspond to the two Testaments of the\r\nChristian Bible and contain (excluding repetitions) more than twice as\r\nmuch matter. They are known separately as the _Vinaya piṭaka_, _Sutta\r\npiṭaka_ and _Abhidhamma piṭaka_, the Basket of Discipline, the\r\nBasket of Discourses and the Basket of Metaphysics. These scriptures are\r\nregarded with the utmost veneration by Buddhists as containing the word\r\nof Buddha (_Buddha-vacanam_), and are reputed to have been recited at\r\nthe first Council held, according to tradition, at Rājagaha immediately\r\nafter Buddha's death _circa_ 540 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt seems more probable that they grew up gradually and did not receive\r\ntheir final shape till about three centuries later, at the Council held\r\nunder the auspices of the Emperor Asoka at Pāṭaliputra _circa_ 247\r\nB.C. The account given of the First Council in the closing chapter of\r\nthe _Culla vagga_ seems to indicate that the Basket of Metaphysics was\r\nthen unknown or unrecognised, and that the scriptures were then a\r\n_Dvi-piṭaka_ (Two Baskets) rather than a _Ti-piṭaka_ (Three\r\nBaskets).\r\n\r\nIf the _Culla vagga_ account is accepted, it would appear that at this\r\nCouncil, expressly held by the Emperor for the consecrative settlement\r\nof the holy texts, the five Nikāyas or divisions which constitute the\r\nsecond Basket formed the subject of discussion between the President\r\nKassappa and Buddha's favourite pupil Ānanda. The _Dhammapada_ is a book\r\nof the fifth Nikāya. The _Mahāvansa_ (Ch. v, 68) carries it back a few\r\nyears earlier than the Council, to the time of the Emperor's conversion\r\nto the Buddhist faith, for on that occasion his teacher, Nigrodha, is\r\nsaid to have explained to him the _Appamāda-vagga_, which is the second\r\nchapter of the work. It was therefore known in the middle or early part\r\nof the third century B.C.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be an Anthology, prepared for the use of the faithful, of\r\nverses believed to be the real words of Buddha, short improvisations in\r\nwhich he expressed striking thoughts and embellished his preaching.\r\nThey were current among the early Buddhists, and have been culled from\r\nthe other scriptures as of high ethical and spiritual value. The\r\nimportance of the _Dhammapada_ for a critical study of Buddhism is thus\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nFor a thorough understanding of the work and of the orthodox Buddhist\r\nview of it, it should be studied with the valuable commentary of\r\nBuddhaghosa. Buddhism owes a profound debt to this great man, and has\r\nrecognised it in the name by which he is known in the Buddhist world.\r\nSays the _Mahāvansa_ (Ch. xxxvii, 174): \"Because he was as profound in\r\nhis eloquence (_ghosa_) as Buddha himself, they conferred on him the\r\nappellation of _Buddha-ghosa_ (the Voice of Buddha), and throughout the\r\nworld he became as renowned as Buddha.\" He was an Indian Brahmana and a\r\ngreat Vedic scholar and apostle. On his conversion to Buddhism he became\r\na not less ardent champion of the new Faith. He came to Ceylon from the\r\ncradle of Buddhism, \"the terrace of the great Bo-tree\" in Buddha Gāya,\r\nin the beginning of the fifth century, _i.e._, nearly a thousand years\r\nafter Buddha's death. He came in search of the old commentaries on the\r\nTripiṭakas. The commentaries had been brought to Ceylon by the\r\nEmperor Asoka's son, the apostle Mahinda, and by him translated into\r\nSinhalese. They continued to be orally transmitted until reduced to\r\nwriting, in the reign of the Ceylon king, Vaṭṭāgamini (88-76\r\nB.C.), at a convocation of learned _bhikkhus_ at the cave-temple of Alu\r\nVihāre in the Matale district.\r\n\r\nThe original Pali version having perished in India, Buddhaghosa, during\r\nhis residence in the Mahā-vihāre at Anuradhapura, re-translated it from\r\nSinhalese to Pali. His version supplanted the Sinhalese (since lost) and\r\nis now the only record remaining of the ancient tradition. He also wrote\r\nelaborate commentaries (_Aṭṭha kathā_)[2] on almost every part of\r\nthe Tri-piṭaka and composed the _Visuddhi magga_, an extensive and\r\nsystematic treatise on Buddhist doctrine, a veritable cyclopædia of\r\nBuddhist theology. His writings are regarded as absolute authorities in\r\nthe interpretation of the Buddhist scriptures, and he is regarded as the\r\nsecond founder of Buddhism in Ceylon. He is held in high reverence also\r\nin Burma as the founder of Buddhism in that country (450 of the\r\nChristian era), having taken the Buddhist scriptures there from Ceylon.\r\n\r\nBuddhaghosa's commentary on the _Dhammapada_ mentions the occasions on\r\nwhich, and the audiences to whom, most of the verses were addressed by\r\nBuddha when, as an itinerant preacher, he went with his followers\r\nthrough the land--mid-Ganges valley and sub-Himalayan tract in the\r\nmodern provinces of Agra, Oude and Behar; his watchwords--not wealth,\r\nfame or dominion, but peace, happiness, deliverance from the burden of\r\nsorrow and death, and his message: \"Open ye your ears, the deliverance\r\nfrom death is found.\"[3]\r\n\r\nWhen he first attained enlightenment under the Bodhi-tree (at Buddha\r\nGāya), a descendant of which still flourishes in Anuradhapura, the\r\noldest historical tree in the world, Buddha is said to have broken out\r\ninto a song of triumph which is included in the anthology of the\r\n_Dhammapada_ (153-4) and has been spiritedly rendered by Mr. Woodward:\r\n\r\n     Through many a round of birth and death I ran,\r\n     Nor found the builder that I sought. Life's stream\r\n     Is birth and death and birth with sorrow filled.\r\n     Now house-holder, thou'rt seen! no more shalt build!\r\n     Broken are all thy rafters, split thy beam!\r\n     All that made up this mortal self is gone;\r\n     Mind hath slain craving. I have crossed the stream!\r\n\r\nThe way that he claimed to have discovered is known as the Middle Way\r\n(_Majjhimā Paṭipadā_), equally removed from an ignoble life of\r\npleasure and a gloomy life of mortification, and consists in a\r\nrealisation of the Four Great Truths (_cattāri ariya saccāni_) of\r\nsuffering, its origin, its end and the path thereto. All existence, he\r\ndeclares, is suffering, its origin is desire, its end is the extinction\r\nof desire, to be attained by the Eightfold Path (_aṭṭhangiko\r\nmaggo_) of right belief, right resolve, right speech, right act, right\r\noccupation, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration and\r\ntranquillity.[4] The exposition and illustration of the Truths and the\r\nWay fill numerous tomes of the Buddhist scriptures.\r\n\r\nIt is these ideals of self-control, self-culture and heroic endeavour,\r\nthe graces of wisdom, purity and love, the eternal law of _Karma_, or\r\ncausality and moral retribution--under which every deed, good or bad,\r\ncomes back most to the doer and yields fruit, helping or marring his\r\nprogress--that are enshrined in the _Dhammapada_ in luminous, pithy\r\nverse which lingers in the memory as a fountain of noble inspiration.\r\nThey are almost too ethereal for human nature's daily food, and it is\r\ngranted to few to realise in actual life these counsels of perfection\r\nunaided.\r\n\r\nBuddha failed to make allowance for the weakness of humanity. His stoic\r\nagnosticism and self-reliant courage ignored God, denied the soul,\r\nrepudiated worship and prayer and made man the master of his fate. This\r\nline of thought was not new to India, however stamped with his own\r\npersonality. But human needs and aspirations have asserted themselves,\r\nand Buddhism has been compelled to absorb elements of doctrine and\r\npractice which he condemned. This has happened, especially, in the\r\ncountries where the doctrine of the Mahāyāna (the Great Vehicle)\r\nprevails.\r\n\r\nIn China, Amitābha (Boundless Light), of whom Gautama Buddha is held to\r\nbe an incarnation, and Kwanyin the Goddess of mercy, have laid great\r\nhold on the affections of the Buddhist population. Kwanyin (Sansk.\r\n_Kanyā_, the Virgin) is the gracious _Sakti_ (Cosmic Power) of the\r\nHindus,\r\n\r\n     Mother of millions of world-clusters,\r\n     Yet Virgin by the Vedas called.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, Amitābha is the Eternal one who is the Light, the Way, and the\r\nLife, and took human form to open the door of salvation to all. Kwanyin\r\nshares with him the sovereignty of Heaven. In Tibet are worshipped these\r\nand other emanations of heavenly beings--Manju Sri, the personification\r\nof wisdom, Avalokitesvara, \"the Lord who looketh down\" on the world\r\nwith mercy to help and protect, Vajrapāna, and others, with a host of\r\nminor deities.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon, which claims to belong to the purer faith, Buddhism is\r\ninterwoven with the worship of, the popular gods of the Hindus and with\r\nanimism and demonology. Under Mahāyānist influence Buddha has become a\r\nGod, greater than others, but worshipped less fervently, for (as Robert\r\nKnox[5] found during his twenty years' residence in the island in the\r\nseventeenth century) the popular mind looks to Buddha for the soul, to\r\nthe gods for the things of this world. His own doctrine remains a dream\r\nof philosophers.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago Buddhism was at one of the lowest ebbs in its history in\r\nthe Island. The arrival of Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, the\r\nfounders of the Theosophical Society, and their zealous propaganda,\r\nmaterially helped the efforts of the saintly Sri Sumangala to stem the\r\ntide, and there arose a renaissance which has had far-reaching effects.\r\nColonel Olcott by his speech and writings did much to remove the\r\nprevailing ignorance and indifference, and recalled Buddhists to a sense\r\nof the value of their Faith.[6] He laid the foundation of that\r\neducational activity which has filled many parts of the Island with\r\nBuddhist schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodward is one of the noble band of Theosophists who have carried\r\non Colonel Olcott's mission in Ceylon, and is perhaps the greatest of\r\nthem all. Not being a Theosophist or Buddhist, I can speak of him more\r\nfreely. Self-sacrificing zeal and devotion are commonplace words to use\r\nof him. They are often said of men, good and zealous in their way, who\r\nhave had the compensations of good incomes and creature comforts,\r\ncongenial friends and efficient fellow-workers. Mr. Woodward (or, to\r\ncall him by his Sanskrit name, _Vanapāla_) was little favoured in these\r\nrespects. His was a life of ascetic simplicity and self-denial and\r\nstrenuous well-doing. An English gentleman of the best type, he combined\r\nin a rare degree the culture of the West and Bast, combined also the\r\nactive spirit of the West with the mysticism of the East. He belongs to\r\nthe roll of the great apostles of Mahayānist Buddhism who carried its\r\nmessage and its culture over the mountains and deserts of Asia to the\r\nPacific Ocean. The Mahinda College, Galle, of which he was the mainstay\r\nfor nearly twenty years, is a shining memorial of him. But who can\r\nestimate the gracious influence of his personality? The memory of it\r\nwill be a cherished possession to his friends, young and old, and an\r\ninspiration to them all, and their gratitude and good wishes follow him\r\nunstintingly to his Tasmanian home.\r\n\r\n                                                  P. ARUNACHALAM\r\n\r\n_Ponklar, Colombo_\r\n  October, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Usually but erroneously translated \"priest,\" ignoring a fundamental\r\ndifference between Buddhism and other religions. Buddhism recognises no\r\npriesthood. By \"priest\" one understands a mediator between God and man,\r\na vehicle of divine grace, a person with delegated authority from God to\r\nadminister the sacraments of religion, to admit into the faith or eject\r\nfrom it, to absolve from sin, etc. Such an institution can have no place\r\nin Buddhism. _Bhikkhu_, (literally, a \"beggar\" and etymologically the\r\nsame word) is one of a brotherhood of men trying to live as Buddha\r\nlived, to purify and discipline themselves, earnest pilgrims on the road\r\nreaching unto deliverance (_Nirvāna_). The layman demands from the\r\n_bhikkhu_ no assistance in heavenly, no interference in worldly,\r\naffairs, but only that he should live as becomes a follower of the great\r\nTeacher. The nearest English equivalent of _bhikkhu is_ \"mendicant\r\nfriar\".\r\n\r\n[2] Sansk. _Artha Kathā_.\r\n\r\n[3] _Mahā-vagga_, i, 6-10 _seq._ The message continues: \"I teach you, I\r\npreach the Norm. If ye walk according to my teaching, ye shall be\r\npartakers, in a short time, of that for which noble youths leave their\r\nhomes and go into homelessness, the highest end of religious effort: ye\r\nshall even in the present life apprehend the Truth itself and see it\r\nface to face.\"\r\n\r\n[4] (1) Sammā diṭṭhi, (2) Sammā sankappo, (3) Sammā vāca, (4) Sammā\r\nkammanto, (5) Sammā ājīvo, (6) Sammā vāyāmo, (7) Sammā sati, (8) Sammā\r\nsamādhi.\r\n\r\n[5] Shipwrecked off Trincomalee in 1660, he remained an unwilling but\r\nfavoured guest of King Raja Sinha II for twenty years. Escaping to\r\nEurope, he wrote his excellent _Historical Relation of the Island of\r\nCeylon_, published 1681.\r\n\r\n[6] It was uphill work for Colonel Olcott, but his magnificent courage\r\nand enthusiasm prevailed over every obstacle. I was then a Magistrate in\r\nthe Kalutara district of the Western Province, and remember that\r\nwell-known Buddhists, appearing as witnesses, would not acknowledge\r\ntheir Faith and swore on the Bible rather than affirm. The Portuguese\r\nand Dutch Governments had persecuted them, and the English Government,\r\nthough it did not persecute, continued for years many disabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nI made this translation of the _Dhammapada_, intending it to be a simple\r\nmemorial text-book for my pupils, at intervals some seven or eight years\r\nago, when reading the Pāli as a lesson in religion with my senior class\r\nin Ceylon. Its publication has been held up for several years owing to\r\nvarious causes, and, having left Ceylon in 1919, I was unable owing to\r\ndistance to correct the proofs. My thanks are due to Mr. Fritz Kunz,\r\nB.A., of Adyar, Madras, for seeing the book through the press. The\r\nrather long list of alterations[1] is due to the fact that I saw no\r\nproofs till the whole was printed off, and had meanwhile desired to\r\nrecast certain verses. The use of metre of course often prohibits the\r\nexact translation of certain philosophical and technical terms, but I\r\nhave kept as close to the original as was possible. I have followed the\r\nPāli text of Fausböll (1900), and have been much helped by Dr. Dines\r\nAndersen's _Glossary of the Words of the Dhammapada_. The Pāli Text\r\nSociety's edition of the text (by Sūriyogoḍa Sumaṅgala Thero)\r\nappeared just after I had finished, and I have made several alterations\r\nin accordance with the readings of that edition.\r\n\r\n                                                    F.L.

let not sloth,[5]\r\n    Let not thy passions toss thee to and fro;[6]\r\n    Lest, swallowing the ball, thou burning cry,\r\n      \"Ah! this is suffering!\"\r\n\r\n  372.\r\n  Who hath no wisdom cannot ecstasy attain;[7]\r\n    Who knows not ecstasy, no wisdom gains;\r\n    Whoso both ecstasy and wisdom hath,\r\n      Unto The Peace is nigh.\r\n\r\n  373.\r\n  The mendicant, whose mind hath gained tranquillity,\r\n    When he hath entered on his empty cell,[8]\r\n    Hath joy beyond man's power to tell, for he\r\n      The Truth discerneth well.\r\n\r\n  374.\r\n  Soon as he grasps the rise and fall of elements,[9]\r\n    Such pleasure and delight thereby he wins\r\n    As falls to them that rightly know the state\r\n      Of immortality.[10]\r\n\r\n  375.\r\n  Let the wise mendicant in this world thus begin;\r\n    Guard thou thy senses; next, with mind content,\r\n    By discipline restrained, seek noble friends\r\n      Who zealous live and pure;\r\n\r\n  376.\r\n  And by the laws of friendship act, live perfectly,\r\n    And upright walk according to the Norm;\r\n    Then in the fullness of thy joy thou shalt\r\n      An end of suffering make.\r\n\r\n  377.\r\n  O mendicants! just as the snow-white _vassikâ_,\r\n    The jasmine, putting forth fresh blooms to-day,\r\n    Sheds down the withered blooms of yesterday,\r\n      So shed ye lust and hate.\r\n\r\n  378.\r\n  Tranquil in body, speech and mind, O mendicants,\r\n    Whoso in every way is well-restrained,\r\n    Who all this world's desires hath thrown aside\r\n      He is \"the tranquil\" called.\r\n\r\n  379.\r\n  Rouse thou the self by self, by self examine self;\r\n    Thus guarded by the self, and with thy mind\r\n    Intent and watchful, thus, O mendicant,\r\n      Thou shall live happily.\r\n\r\n  380.\r\n  Yea! Self is guard of self and refuge takes in self;\r\n    Just as a dealer trains a thoroughbred,\r\n    A noble steed, and breaks him to the rein,\r\n      So do thou self restrain.\r\n\r\n  381.\r\n  That mendicant, with utter joy and gladness filled,\r\n    Firm in the teaching of the Awakened One,\r\n    Reaches the bliss where all conditions cease,\r\n      Reaches the State of Peace.\r\n\r\n  382.\r\n  Lo ye! a mendicant, though young he be, that strives\r\n    To grasp the teaching of the Awakened One,\r\n    Lights up the world, as from a cloud released\r\n      The moon lights up the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Cf. vv. 229-30.\r\n\r\n[2] _Nāma rūpa_, a traditional Vedic term for \"mind and Matter,\" the\r\nimmortal and the perishable, borrowed by the Buddha to stand for the\r\nmental and bodily compound in the individual, cf. _Buddhist Psychology_,\r\nMrs. C.A.

as\r\n_samitatta_, \"quieted\" is here supposed to be that of _samana_, ascetic\r\nmonk. _Pabbajjā_ is one who \"goes forth,\" takes the robes, becomes\r\nordained a Buddhist mendicant monk.\r\n\r\n[5] Cf. the words of the Christ to the Pharisees: \"Now do ye Pharisees\r\nmake clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but your inward part\r\nis full of ravening and wickedness.\" The word used, _gahanam_,\r\n'grasping,' may also mean 'jungle'.\r\n\r\n[6] These were the marks of the early and stricter ascetics;

These Brahmins who did not accept the Buddha as\r\nMaster would address Him in this way, and of course they were often\r\nwealthy men.\r\n\r\n[8] _The strap_ is said to be hate; _the thong_, desire; _the ropes_,\r\northodoxy with its attendant narrowness; _the bar_, ignorance that shuts\r\nthe door of knowledge.\r\n\r\n[9] _Cuti_; _gati_; the \"fall\" from other worlds into this one, and the\r\n'going' or passage or state of the next birth.\r\n\r\n[10] Like a bull.\r\n\r\n[11] _Nahātakam_, an allusion to the ceremonial bathing of the Brāhmaṇa\r\nafter finishing his course of studies.\r\n\r\n[12] The meaning of buddha.\r\n\r\n[13] One who knows earth, heaven and hell, and can range them at will,\r\nis called _ñānatilōka_, \"knower of the three worlds\". Such a one is born\r\nno more, as he has learned the lessons of these worlds.",
