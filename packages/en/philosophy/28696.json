Triliteral and Multiliteral\r\nPropositions (such as \"All abc are de\"). Hypotheticals. Dilemmas. &c.\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n_Part III. TRANSCENDENTAL._\r\n\r\nAnalysis of a Proposition into its Elements. Numerical and Geometrical\r\nProblems. The Theory of Inference. The Construction of Problems. And\r\nmany other _Curiosa Logica_.\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg-viii\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief alterations, since the First Edition, have been made in the\r\nChapter on 'Classification' (pp. 2, 3) and the Book on 'Propositions'\r\n(pp. 10 to 19). The chief additions have been the questions on words and\r\nphrases, added to the Examination-Papers at p. 94, and the Notes\r\ninserted at pp. 164, 194.\r\n\r\nIn Book I, Chapter II, I have adopted a new definition of\r\n'Classification', which enables me to regard the whole Universe as a\r\n'Class,' and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase 'a Set of\r\nThings.'\r\n\r\nIn the Chapter on 'Propositions of Existence' I have adopted a new\r\n'normal form,' in which the Class, whose existence is affirmed or\r\ndenied, is regarded as the _Predicate_, instead of the _Subject_, of the\r\nProposition, thus evading a very subtle difficulty which besets the\r\nother form. These subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every\r\nTree of Knowledge, and they are _far_ more hopeless to grapple with than\r\nany that occur in its higher branches. For example, the difficulties of\r\nthe Forty-Seventh Proposition of Euclid are mere child's play compared\r\nwith the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential\r\nnature of a straight Line. And, in the present work, the difficulties of\r\nthe \"5 Liars\" Problem, at p. 192, are \"trifles, light as air,\" compared\r\nwith the bewildering question \"What is a Thing?\"\r\n\r\nIn the Chapter on 'Propositions of Relation' I have inserted a new\r\nSection, containing the proof that a Proposition, beginning with \"All,\"\r\nis a _Double_ Proposition (a fact that is quite independent of the\r\narbitrary rule, laid down in the next Section, that such a Proposition\r\nis to be understood as implying the actual _existence_ of its Subject).\r\nThis proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the\r\ncourse of the discussion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its _proper_\r\nplace, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it.\r\n                                                                   pg-ix\r\nIn the Sorites-Examples, I have made a good many verbal alterations, in\r\norder to evade a difficulty, which I fear will have perplexed some of\r\nthe Readers of the first three Editions. Some of the Premisses were so\r\nworded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ. named in the\r\nDictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ. was only a\r\nportion. In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should\r\nperceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted\r\nof the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of\r\nits _other_ portion. Thus, in Ex. 15, the Univ. was stated to be \"ducks\r\nin this village,\" and the third Premiss was \"Mrs. Bond has no gray\r\nducks,\" i.e. \"No gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs. Bond.\" Here the\r\nTerms are _not_ Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class \"ducks,\"\r\nof which the Univ. is only a portion: and it was intended that the\r\nReader should perceive that what is here asserted of \"ducks\" is thereby\r\nasserted of \"ducks in this village.\" and should treat this Premiss as if\r\nit were \"Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks in this village,\" and should\r\nignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the _other_ portion of the\r\nClass \"ducks,\" viz. \"Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks _out of_ this village\".\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix I have given a new version of the Problem of the \"Five\r\nLiars.\" My object, in doing so, is to escape the subtle and mysterious\r\ndifficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a Proposition as\r\nbeing its own Subject, or a Set of Propositions as being Subjects for\r\none another. It is certainly, a most bewildering and unsatisfactory\r\ntheory: one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of\r\n_substance_ in all this shadowy host----that, as the procession of\r\nphantoms glides before us, there is not _one_ that we can pounce upon,\r\nand say \"_Here_ is a Proposition that _must_ be either true or\r\nfalse!\"----that it is but a Barmecide Feast, to which we have been\r\nbidden----and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island,\r\nwhose inhabitants \"earned a precarious living by taking in each others'\r\nwashing\"! By simply translating \"telling 2 Truths\" into \"taking _both_\r\nof 2 condiments (salt and mustard),\" \"telling 2 Lies\" into \"taking\r\n_neither_ of them\" and \"telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)\"\r\ninto \"taking only _one_ condiment (it is not specified _which_),\" I have\r\nescaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem\r\nwhich, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the\r\nvery same _Data_ as were furnished by the Problem of the \"Five Liars.\"\r\n                                                                   pg-x\r\nThe coined words, introduced in previous editions, such as \"Eliminands\"\r\nand \"Retinends\", perhaps hardly need any apology: they were\r\nindispensable to my system: but the new plural, here used for the first\r\ntime, viz. \"Soriteses\", will, I fear, be condemned as \"bad English\",\r\nunless I say a word in its defence. We have _three_ singular nouns, in\r\nEnglish, of plural _form_, \"series\", \"species\", and \"Sorites\": in all\r\nthree, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and\r\nplural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case\r\nof \"series\" by coining the plural \"serieses\", which has already found\r\nits way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely\r\n\"following suit\", in using the new plural \"Soriteses\".\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me point out that even those, who are obliged to\r\nstudy _Formal_ Logic, with a view to being able to answer\r\nExamination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of _Symbolic_\r\nLogic most helpful for this purpose, in throwing light upon many of the\r\nobscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a\r\ndelightfully easy method of _testing_ the results arrived at by the\r\ncumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries.\r\n\r\nThis is, I believe, the very first attempt (with the exception of my own\r\nlittle book, _The Game of Logic_, published in 1886, a very incomplete\r\nperformance) that has been made to _popularise_ this fascinating\r\nsubject. It has cost me _years_ of hard work: but if it should prove, as\r\nI hope it may, to be of _real_ service to the young, and to be taken up,\r\nin High Schools and in private families, as a valuable addition to their\r\nstock of healthful mental recreations, such a result would more than\r\nrepay ten times the labour that I have expended on it.\r\n\r\n                                                                L. C.\r\n\r\n29, BEDFORD STREET, STRAND.\r\n    _Christmas, 1896._\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg-xi\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n_TO LEARNERS._\r\n\r\n[N.B. Some remarks, addressed to _Teachers_, will be found in the\r\nAppendix, at p. 165.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Learner, who wishes to try the question _fairly_, whether this\r\nlittle book does, or does not, supply the materials for a most\r\ninteresting mental recreation, is _earnestly_ advised to adopt the\r\nfollowing Rules:--\r\n\r\n(1) Begin at the _beginning_, and do not allow yourself to gratify a\r\nmere idle curiosity by dipping into the book, here and there. This would\r\nvery likely lead to your throwing it aside, with the remark \"This is\r\n_much_ too hard for me!\", and thus losing the chance of adding a very\r\n_large_ item to your stock of mental delights. This Rule (of not\r\n_dipping_) is very _desirable_ with _other_ kinds of books----such as\r\nnovels, for instance, where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment\r\nyou would otherwise get from the story, by dipping into it further on,\r\nso that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as\r\na matter of course. Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into\r\nVol. III first, just to see how the story ends: and perhaps it _is_ as\r\nwell just to know that all ends _happily_----that the much-persecuted\r\nlovers _do_ marry after all, that he is proved to be quite innocent of\r\nthe murder, that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and\r\ngets the punishment he deserves, and that the rich uncle in India (_Qu._\r\nWhy in _India_? _Ans._ Because, somehow, uncles never _can_ get rich\r\nanywhere else) dies at exactly the right moment----before taking the\r\ntrouble to read Vol. I. This, I say, is _just_ permissible with a\r\n_novel_, where Vol. III has a _meaning_, even for those who have not\r\nread the earlier part of the story; but, with a _scientific_ book, it is\r\nsheer insanity: you will find the latter part _hopelessly_\r\nunintelligible, if you read it before reaching it in regular course.\r\n                                                                   pg-xii\r\n(2) Don't begin any fresh Chapter, or Section, until you are certain\r\nthat you _thoroughly_ understand the whole book _up to that point_, and\r\nthat you have worked, correctly, most if not all of the examples which\r\nhave been set. So long as you are conscious that all the land you have\r\npassed through is absolutely _conquered_, and that you are leaving no\r\nunsolved difficulties _behind_ you, which will be sure to turn up again\r\nlater on, your triumphal progress will be easy and delightful.\r\nOtherwise, you will find your state of puzzlement get worse and worse as\r\nyou proceed, till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust.\r\n\r\n(3) When you come to any passage you don't understand, _read it again_:\r\nif you _still_ don't understand it, _read it again_: if you fail, even\r\nafter _three_ readings, very likely your brain is getting a little\r\ntired. In that case, put the book away, and take to other occupations,\r\nand next day, when you come to it fresh, you will very likely find that\r\nit is _quite_ easy.\r\n\r\n(4) If possible, find some genial friend, who will read the book along\r\nwith you, and will talk over the difficulties with you. _Talking_ is a\r\nwonderful smoother-over of difficulties. When _I_ come upon\r\nanything----in Logic or in any other hard subject----that entirely\r\npuzzles me, I find it a capital plan to talk it over, _aloud_, even when\r\nI am all alone. One can explain things so _clearly_ to one's self! And\r\nthen, you know, one is so _patient_ with one's self: one _never_ gets\r\nirritated at one's own stupidity!\r\n\r\nIf, dear Reader, you will faithfully observe these Rules, and so give my\r\nlittle book a really _fair_ trial, I promise you, most confidently, that\r\nyou will find Symbolic Logic to be one of the most, if not _the_ most,\r\nfascinating of mental recreations! In this First Part, I have carefully\r\navoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an\r\nintelligent child of (say) twelve or fourteen years of age. I have\r\nmyself taught most of its contents, _vivâ voce_, to _many_ children, and\r\nhave found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject. For\r\nthose, who succeed in mastering Part I, and who begin, like Oliver,\r\n\"asking for more,\" I hope to provide, in Part II, some _tolerably_ hard\r\nnuts to crack----nuts that will require all the nut-crackers they happen\r\nto possess!\r\n                                                                   pg-xiii\r\nMental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental\r\nhealth; and you may get much healthy enjoyment, no doubt, from Games,\r\nsuch as Back-gammon, Chess, and the new Game \"Halma\". But, after all,\r\nwhen you have made yourself a first-rate player at any one of these\r\nGames, you have nothing real to _show_ for it, as a _result!_ You\r\nenjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, _at the time_: but you have\r\nno _result_ that you can treasure up and get real _good_ out of. And,\r\nall the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect _mine_ of\r\nwealth. Once master the machinery of Symbolic Logic, and you have a\r\nmental occupation always at hand, of absorbing interest, and one that\r\nwill be of real _use_ to you in _any_ subject you may take up.

The Class so\r\nformed (i.e. the Class \"Things\") contains the whole Universe.\r\n\r\n(2) We may think of the Class \"Things,\" and may imagine that we have\r\npicked out from it all the Things which possess a certain Adjunct _not_\r\npossessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to\r\nthe Class so formed. In this case, the Class \"Things\" is called a\r\n'=Genus=' with regard to the Class so formed: the Class, so formed, is\r\ncalled a '=Species=' of the Class \"Things\": and its peculiar Adjunct is\r\ncalled its '=Differentia='.\r\n                                                                   pg002\r\nAs this Process is entirely _Mental_, we can perform it whether there\r\n_is_, or _is not_, an _existing_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct. If\r\nthere _is_, the Class is said to be '=Real='; if not, it is said to be\r\n'=Unreal=', or '=Imaginary=.'\r\n\r\n    [For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the\r\n    Class \"Things,\" all the Things which possess the Adjunct\r\n    \"material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets\"; and we\r\n    may thus form the Real Class \"towns.\" Here we may regard\r\n    \"Things\" as a _Genus_, \"Towns\" as a _Species_ of Things, and\r\n    \"material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets\" as its\r\n    _Differentia_.\r\n\r\n    Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the Things\r\n    which possess the Adjunct \"weighing a ton, easily lifted by a\r\n    baby\"; and we may thus form the _Imaginary_ Class \"Things that\r\n    weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby.\"]\r\n\r\n(3) We may think of a certain Class, _not_ the Class \"Things,\" and may\r\nimagine that we have picked out from it all the Members of it which\r\npossess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class. This\r\nAdjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the smaller Class so formed. In\r\nthis case, the Class thought of is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the\r\nsmaller Class picked out from it: the smaller Class is called a\r\n'=Species=' of the larger: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its\r\n'=Differentia='.\r\n\r\n    [For example, we may think of the Class \"towns,\" and imagine\r\n    that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the\r\n    Attribute \"lit with gas\"; and we may thus form the Real Class\r\n    \"towns lit with gas.\" Here we may regard \"Towns\" as a _Genus_,\r\n    \"Towns lit with gas\" as a _Species_ of Towns, and \"lit with gas\"\r\n    as its _Differentia_.\r\n\r\n    If, in the above example, we were to alter \"lit with gas\" into\r\n    \"paved with gold,\" we should get the _Imaginary_ Class \"towns\r\n    paved with gold.\"]\r\n\r\nA Class, containing only _one_ Member is called an '=Individual=.'\r\n\r\n    [For example, the Class \"towns having four million inhabitants,\"\r\n    which Class contains only _one_ Member, viz. \"London.\"]\r\n                                                                   pg002½\r\nHence, any single Thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from\r\nall other Things, may be regarded as a one-Member Class.\r\n\r\n    [Thus \"London\" may be regarded as the one-Member Class, picked\r\n    out from the Class \"towns,\" which has, as its Differentia,\r\n    \"having four million inhabitants.\"]\r\n\r\nA Class, containing two or more Members, is sometimes regarded as _one\r\nsingle Thing_. When so regarded, it may possess an Adjunct which is\r\n_not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, the Class \"The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment,\" when\r\n    regarded as _one single Thing_, may possess the Attribute\r\n    \"formed in square,\" which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it\r\n    taken separately.]\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg003\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_DIVISION._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\n_Introductory._\r\n\r\n'Division' is a Mental Process, in which we think of a certain Class of\r\nThings, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller\r\nClasses.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, we might think of the Class \"books,\" and imagine that we\r\n    had divided it into the two smaller Classes \"bound books\" and\r\n    \"unbound books,\" or into the three Classes, \"books priced at\r\n    less than a shilling,\" \"shilling-books,\" \"books priced at more\r\n    than a shilling,\" or into the twenty-six Classes, \"books whose\r\n    names begin with _A_,\" \"books whose names begin with _B_,\" &c.]\r\n\r\nA Class, that has been obtained by a certain Division, is said to be\r\n'codivisional' with every Class obtained by that Division.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, the Class \"bound books\" is codivisional with each of the\r\n    two Classes, \"bound books\" and \"unbound books.\"\r\n\r\n    Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been\r\n    \"contemporary\" with every event that happened in 1815.]\r\n\r\nHence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, the Class \"bound books\" is codivisional with itself.\r\n\r\n    Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been\r\n    \"contemporary\" with itself.]\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg003½\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n_Dichotomy._\r\n\r\nIf we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from\r\nit a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the _Remainder_ of the\r\nlarge Class does _not_ possess the Differentia of that smaller Class.\r\nHence it may be regarded as _another_ smaller Class, whose Differentia\r\nmay be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the\r\nword \"not\"; and we may imagine that we have _divided_ the Class first\r\nthought of into _two_ smaller Classes, whose Differentiæ are\r\n_contradictory_. This kind of Division is called '=Dichotomy='.\r\n\r\n    [For example, we may divide \"books\" into the two Classes whose\r\n    Differentiæ are \"old\" and \"not-old.\"]\r\n\r\nIn performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we\r\nhave chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is\r\nnot easy to decide _which_ of the Things belong to the one Class and\r\n_which_ to the other. In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down\r\nsome arbitrary _rule_, as to _where_ the one Class should end and the\r\nother begin.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, in dividing \"books\" into \"old\" and \"not-old,\" we may say\r\n    \"Let all books printed before A.D. 1801, be regarded as 'old,'\r\n    and all others as 'not-old'.\"]\r\n\r\nHenceforwards let it be understood that, if a Class of Things be divided\r\ninto two Classes, whose Differentiæ have contrary meanings, each\r\nDifferentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word\r\n\"not\" prefixed.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, if \"books\" be divided into \"old\" and \"new\" the Attribute\r\n    \"old\" is to be regarded as equivalent to \"not-new,\" and the\r\n    Attribute \"new\" as equivalent to \"not-old.\"]\r\n                                                                   pg004\r\nAfter dividing a Class, by the Process of _Dichotomy_, into two smaller\r\nClasses, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes;\r\nand this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of\r\nClasses being doubled at each repetition.\r\n\r\n    [For example, we may divide \"books\" into \"old\" and \"new\" (i.e.\r\n    \"_not_-old\"): we may then sub-divide each of these into\r\n    \"English\" and \"foreign\" (i.e. \"_not_-English\"), thus getting\r\n    _four_ Classes, viz.\r\n\r\n        (1) old English;\r\n        (2) old foreign;\r\n        (3) new English;\r\n        (4) new foreign.\r\n\r\n    If we had begun by dividing into \"English\" and \"foreign,\" and\r\n    had then sub-divided into \"old\" and \"new,\" the four Classes\r\n    would have been\r\n\r\n        (1) English old;\r\n        (2) English new;\r\n        (3) foreign old;\r\n        (4) foreign new.\r\n\r\n    The Reader will easily see that these are the very same four\r\n    Classes which we had before.]\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg004½\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_NAMES._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word \"Thing\", which conveys the idea of a Thing, _without_ any idea\r\nof an Adjunct, represents _any_ single Thing. Any other word (or\r\nphrase), which conveys the idea of a Thing, _with_ the idea of an\r\nAdjunct represents _any_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct; i.e., it\r\nrepresents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is _peculiar_.\r\n\r\nSuch a word (or phrase) is called a '=Name='; and, if there be an\r\nexisting Thing which it represents, it is said to be a Name of that\r\nThing.\r\n\r\n    [For example, the words \"Thing,\" \"Treasure,\" \"Town,\" and the\r\n    phrases \"valuable Thing,\" \"material artificial Thing consisting\r\n    of houses and streets,\" \"Town lit with gas,\" \"Town paved with\r\n    gold,\" \"old English Book.\"]\r\n\r\nJust as a Class is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there\r\n_is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing in it, so also a Name is said to be\r\n_Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing\r\nThing represented by it.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, \"Town lit with gas\" is a _Real_ Name: \"Town paved with\r\n    gold\" is an _Unreal_ Name.]\r\n\r\nEvery Name is either a Substantive only, or else a phrase consisting of\r\na Substantive and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as\r\nAdjectives).\r\n\r\nEvery Name, except \"Thing\", may usually be expressed in three different\r\nforms:--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Substantive \"Thing\", and one or more\r\n    Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying\r\n    the ideas of the Attributes;\r\n                                                                   pg005\r\n    (_b_) A Substantive, conveying the idea of a Thing with\r\n    the ideas of _some_ of the Attributes, and one or more\r\n    Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives) conveying\r\n    the ideas of the _other_ Attributes;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) A Substantive conveying the idea of a Thing with\r\n    the ideas of _all_ the Attributes.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, the phrase \"material living Thing, belonging to the\r\n    Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet\" is a Name\r\n    expressed in Form (_a_).\r\n\r\n    If we choose to roll up together the Substantive \"Thing\" and the\r\n    Adjectives \"material, living, belonging to the Animal Kingdom,\"\r\n    so as to make the new Substantive \"Animal,\" we get the phrase\r\n    \"Animal having two hands and two feet,\" which is a Name\r\n    (representing the same Thing as before) expressed in Form (_b_).\r\n\r\n    And, if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word, so\r\n    as to make the new Substantive \"Man,\" we get a Name (still\r\n    representing the very same Thing) expressed in Form (_c_).]\r\n\r\nA Name, whose Substantive is in the _plural_ number, may be used to\r\nrepresent either\r\n\r\n    (1) Members of a Class, _regarded as separate Things_;\r\n    or (2) a whole Class, _regarded as one single Thing_.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, when I say \"Some soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are\r\n    tall,\" or \"The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are brave,\" I am\r\n    using the Name \"soldiers of the Tenth Regiment\" in the _first_\r\n    sense; and it is just the same as if I were to point to each of\r\n    them _separately_, and to say \"_This_ soldier of the Tenth\r\n    Regiment is tall,\" \"_That_ soldier of the Tenth Regiment is\r\n    tall,\" and so on.\r\n\r\n    But, when I say \"The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are formed\r\n    in square,\" I am using the phrase in the _second_ sense; and it\r\n    is just the same as if I were to say \"The _Tenth Regiment_ is\r\n    formed in square.\"]\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg006\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_DEFINITIONS._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident that every Member of a _Species_ is _also_ a Member of the\r\n_Genus_ out of which that Species has been picked, and that it possesses\r\nthe _Differentia_ of that Species. Hence it may be represented by a Name\r\nconsisting of two parts, one being a Name representing any Member of the\r\n_Genus_, and the other being the _Differentia_ of that Species. Such a\r\nName is called a '=Definition=' of any Member of that Species, and to\r\ngive it such a Name is to '=define=' it.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, we may define a \"Treasure\" as a \"valuable Thing.\" In this\r\n    case we regard \"Things\" as the _Genus_, and \"valuable\" as the\r\n    _Differentia_.]\r\n\r\nThe following Examples, of this Process, may be taken as models for\r\nworking others.\r\n\r\n    [Note that, in each Definition, the Substantive, representing a\r\n    Member (or Members) of the _Genus_, is printed in Capitals.]\r\n\r\n1.

Such Propositions will be discussed in\r\n    Part II.]\r\n\r\nThe Genus, of which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the\r\n'=Universe of Discourse=,' or (more briefly) the '=Univ.='\r\n\r\nThe Sign of Quantity is \"Some\" or \"No\" or \"All\".\r\n\r\n    [Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_\r\n    Members of its Subject are _also_ Members of its Predicate, it\r\n    does not tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with\r\n    _three_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, \"0\", \"1 or\r\n    more\", \"the total number of Members of the Subject\".]\r\n\r\nIt is called \"a Proposition of Relation\" because its effect is to assert\r\nthat a certain _relationship_ exists between its Terms.\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg013\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n_Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form._\r\n\r\nThe Rules, for doing this, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Ascertain what is the _Subject_ (i.e., ascertain what Class we are\r\n_talking about_);\r\n\r\n(2) If the verb, governed by the Subject, is _not_ the verb \"are\" (or\r\n\"is\"), substitute for it a phrase beginning with \"are\" (or \"is\");\r\n\r\n(3) Ascertain what is the _Predicate_ (i.e., ascertain what Class it is,\r\nwhich is asserted to contain _some_, or _none_, or _all_, of the Members\r\nof the Subject);\r\n\r\n(4) If the Name of each Term is _completely expressed_ (i.e. if it\r\ncontains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the 'Univ.'; but,\r\nif either Name is _incompletely expressed_, and contains _Attributes_\r\nonly, it is then necessary to determine a 'Univ.', in order to insert\r\nits Name as the Substantive.\r\n\r\n(5) Ascertain the _Sign of Quantity_;\r\n\r\n(6) Arrange in the following order:--\r\n\r\n    Sign of Quantity,\r\n    Subject,\r\n    Copula,\r\n    Predicate.\r\n\r\n    [Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1)\r\n\r\n    \"Some apples are not ripe.\"\r\n\r\n    (1) The Subject is \"apples.\"\r\n\r\n    (2) The Verb is \"are.\"\r\n\r\n    (3) The Predicate is \"not-ripe * * *.\" (As no Substantive is\r\n    expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ. is to be,\r\n    we are forced to leave a blank.)\r\n\r\n    (4) Let Univ. be \"fruit.\"\r\n\r\n    (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"some.\"\r\n\r\n    (6) The Proposition now becomes\r\n\r\n        \"Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg014\r\n    (2)\r\n\r\n    \"None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent.\"\r\n\r\n    (1) The Subject is \"my speculations.\"\r\n\r\n    (2) The Verb is \"have brought,\" for which we substitute the\r\n    phrase \"are * * * that have brought\".\r\n\r\n    (3) The Predicate is \"* * * that have brought &c.\"\r\n\r\n    (4) Let Univ. be \"transactions.\"\r\n\r\n    (5) The Sign of Quantity is \"none of.\"\r\n\r\n    (6) The Proposition now becomes\r\n\r\n        \"None of | my speculations | are | transactions\r\n        that have brought me as much as 5 per cent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    (3)\r\n\r\n    \"None but the brave deserve the fair.\"\r\n\r\n    To begin with, we note that the phrase \"none but the brave\" is\r\n    equivalent to \"no _not_-brave.\"\r\n\r\n    (1) The Subject has for its _Attribute_ \"not-brave.\" But no\r\n    _Substantive_ is supplied.

Hence, _every_ banker is either in the Class \"rich men\",\r\n    or else in the Class \"poor men\".]\r\n\r\nAlso we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, _some_\r\nMembers of the Subject are in Class (1). What _else_ do we need to be\r\ntold, in order to know that _all_ of them are there?

obtained, as far as\r\nthey go.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us suppose that we find a _Red_ Counter placed in the\r\nNorth-West Cell.\r\n\r\n    ·-------·\r\n    |(.)|   |\r\n    |---|---|\r\n    |   |   |\r\n

Counter, when placed in the\r\nNorth-East, or South-West, or South-East Cell.\r\n\r\nNext, let us suppose that we find a _Grey_ Counter placed in the\r\nNorth-West Cell.\r\n\r\n    ·-------·\r\n    |(

x\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly we may interpret a _Grey_ Counter, when placed in the\r\nNorth-East, or South-West, or South-East Cell.\r\n                                                                   pg037\r\nNext, let us suppose that we find a _Red_ Counter placed on the\r\npartition which divides the North Half.\r\n\r\n    ·-------·\r\n    |  (.)  |\r\n    |---|---|\r\n    |   |   |\r\n    ·-------·\r\n\r\nWe know that this represents the Proposition \"Some x exist.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly we may interpret a _Red_ Counter, when placed on the partition\r\nwhich divides the South, or West, or East Half.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext, let us suppose that we find _two Red_ Counters placed in the North\r\nHalf, one in each Cell.\r\n\r\n    ·-------·\r\n    |(.)|(.)|\r\n    |---|---|\r\n    |   |   |\r\n    ·-------·\r\n\r\nWe know that this represents the _Double_ Proposition \"Some x are y and\r\nsome are y'\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly we may interpret _two Red_ Counters, when placed in the South,\r\nor West, or East Half.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext, let us suppose that we find _two Grey_ Counters placed in the\r\nNorth Half, one in each Cell.\r\n\r\n    ·-------·\r\n    |( )|( )|\r\n    |---|---|\r\n    |   |   |\r\n    ·-------·\r\n\r\nWe know that this represents the Proposition \"No x exist\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly we may interpret _two Grey_ Counters, when placed in the\r\nSouth, or West, or East Half.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLastly, let us suppose that we find a _Red_ and a _Grey_ Counter placed\r\nin the North Half, the _Red_ in the North-_West_ Cell, and the _Grey_ in\r\nthe North-_East_ Cell.\r\n\r\n    ·-------·\r\n    |(.)|( )|\r\n    |---|---|\r\n    |   |   |\r\n    ·-------·\r\n\r\nWe know that this represents the Proposition, \"All x are y\".\r\n\r\n    [Note that the _Half_, occupied by the two Counters, settles\r\n    what is to be the _Subject_ of the Proposition, and that the\r\n    _Cell_, occupied by the _Red_ Counter, settles what is to be its\r\n    _Predicate_.]\r\n                                                                   pg038\r\nSimilarly we may interpret a _Red_ and a _Grey_ counter, when placed in\r\nany one of the seven similar positions\r\n\r\n    Red in North-East, Grey in North-West;\r\n    Red in South-West, Grey in South-East;\r\n    Red in South-East, Grey in South-West;\r\n    Red in North-West, Grey in South-West;\r\n    Red in South-West, Grey in North-West;\r\n    Red in North-East, Grey in South-East;\r\n    Red in South-East, Grey in North-East.\r\n\r\nOnce more the genial friend must be appealed to, and requested to\r\nexamine the Reader on Tables II and III, and to make him not only\r\n_represent_ Propositions, but also _interpret_ Diagrams when marked with\r\nCounters.\r\n\r\nThe Questions and Answers should be like this:--\r\n\r\n    Q. Represent \"No x' are y'.\"\r\n    A. Grey Counter in S.E. Cell.\r\n    Q. Interpret Red Counter on E. partition.\r\n    A. \"Some y' exist.\"\r\n    Q. Represent \"All y' are x.\"\r\n    A.

The _right_-hand Diagram shows the result.\r\n\r\n    [The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_\r\n    to refer to the above Diagrams, but to make a large copy of the\r\n    right-hand one for himself, _without any letters_, and to have\r\n    it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular\r\n    _part_ of it, about which he is reading.]\r\n                                                                   pg040\r\nSecondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which\r\nwe may call \"m\", and have subdivided the xy-Class into the two Classes\r\nwhose Differentiæ are m and m', and that we have assigned the N.W.\r\n_Inner_ Cell to the one (which we may call \"the Class of xym-Things\", or\r\n\"the xym-Class\"), and the N.W. _Outer_ Cell to the other (which we may\r\ncall \"the Class of xym'-Things\", or \"the xym'-Class\").\r\n\r\n    [Thus, in the \"books\" example, we might say \"Let m mean 'bound',\r\n    so that m' will mean 'unbound'\", and we might suppose that we\r\n    had subdivided the Class \"old English books\" into the two\r\n    Classes, \"old English bound books\" and \"old English unbound\r\n    books\", and had assigned the N.W. _Inner_ Cell to the one, and\r\n    the N.W. _Outer_ Cell to the other.]\r\n\r\nThirdly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the xy'-Class, the\r\nx'y-Class, and the x'y'-Class in the same manner, and have, in each\r\ncase, assigned the _Inner_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute m,\r\nand the _Outer_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute m'.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, in the \"books\" example, we might suppose that we had\r\n    subdivided the \"new English books\" into the two Classes, \"new\r\n    English bound books\" and \"new English unbound books\", and had\r\n    assigned the S.W. _Inner_ Cell to the one, and the S.W. _Outer_\r\n    Cell to the other.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that we have now assigned the _Inner Square_ to the\r\nm-Class, and the _Outer Border_ to the m'-Class.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, in the \"books\" example, we have assigned the _Inner\r\n    Square_ to \"bound books\" and the _Outer Border_ to \"unbound\r\n    books\".]\r\n\r\nWhen the Reader has made himself familiar with this Diagram, he ought to\r\nbe able to find, in a moment, the Compartment assigned to a particular\r\n_pair_ of Attributes, or the Cell assigned to a particular _trio_ of\r\nAttributes. The following Rules will help him in doing this:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Arrange the Attributes in the order x, y, m.\r\n                                                                   pg041\r\n    (2) Take the _first_ of them and find the Compartment\r\n    assigned to it.\r\n\r\n    (3) Then take the _second_, and find what _portion_ of that\r\n    compartment is assigned to it.\r\n\r\n    (4) Treat the _third_, if there is one, in the same way.\r\n\r\n    [For example, suppose we have to find the Compartment assigned\r\n    to ym. We say to ourselves \"y has the _West_ Half; and m has the\r\n    _Inner_ portion of that West Half.\"\r\n\r\n    Again, suppose we have to find the Cell assigned to x'ym'. We\r\n    say to ourselves \"x' has the _South_ Half; y has the _West_\r\n    portion of that South Half, i.e. has the _South-West Quarter_;\r\n    and m' has the _Outer_ portion of that South-West Quarter.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Reader should now get his genial friend to question him on the Table\r\ngiven on the next page, in the style of the following specimen-Dialogue.\r\n\r\n    Q. Adjunct for South Half, Inner Portion?\r\n    A. x'm.\r\n    Q. Compartment for m'?\r\n    A. The Outer Border.\r\n    Q. Adjunct for North-East Quarter, Outer Portion?\r\n    A. xy'm'.\r\n    Q.

now begin to draw little Diagrams for himself, and\r\nto mark them with the Digits \"I\" and \"O\", instead of using the Board and\r\nCounters: he may put a \"I\" to represent a _Red_ Counter (this may be\r\ninterpreted to mean \"There is at least _one_ Thing here\"), and a \"O\" to\r\nrepresent a _Grey_ Counter (this may be interpreted to mean \"There is\r\n_nothing_ here\").\r\n\r\nThe Pair of Propositions, that we shall have to represent, will always\r\nbe, one in terms of x and m, and the other in terms of y and m.\r\n\r\nWhen we have to represent a Proposition beginning with \"All\", we break\r\nit up into the _two_ Propositions to which it is equivalent.\r\n\r\nWhen we have to represent, on the same Diagram, Propositions, of which\r\nsome begin with \"Some\" and others with \"No\", we represent the _negative_\r\nones _first_. This will sometimes save us from having to put a \"I\" \"on a\r\nfence\" and afterwards having to shift it into a Cell.\r\n\r\n    [Let us work a few examples.\r\n\r\n    (1)\r\n\r\n        \"No x are m';\r\n         No y' are m\".\r\n\r\n    Let us first represent \"No x are m'\". This gives us Diagram a.\r\n\r\n    Then, representing \"No y' are m\" on the same Diagram, we get\r\n    Diagram b.\r\n                                                                   pg051\r\n                a                        b\r\n        ·---------------·        ·---------------·\r\n        |(O)    |    (O)|        |(O)    |    (O)|\r\n        |   ·---|---·   |        |   ·---|---·   |\r\n        |   |   |   |   |        |   |   |(O)|   |\r\n        |---|---|---|---|        |---|---|---|---|\r\n        |   |   |   |   |        |   |   |(O)|   |\r\n        |   ·---|---·   |        |   ·---|---·   |\r\n        |       |       |        |       |       |\r\n        ·---------------·        ·---------------·\r\n\r\n    (2)\r\n\r\n        \"Some m are x;\r\n         No m are y\".\r\n\r\n    If, neglecting the Rule, we were begin with \"Some m are x\", we\r\n    should get Diagram a.\r\n\r\n    And if we were then to take \"No m are y\", which tells us that\r\n    the Inner N.W. Cell is _empty_, we should be obliged to take the\r\n    \"I\" off the fence (as it no longer has the choice of _two_\r\n    Cells), and to put it into the Inner N.E.

He can then read off, from the Biliteral Diagram,\r\nthe required Propositions. After a little practice, he will be able to\r\ndispense with the Biliteral Diagram, and to read off the result from the\r\nTriliteral Diagram itself.\r\n\r\nTo _transfer_ the information, observe the following Rules:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Examine the N.W. Quarter of the Triliteral Diagram.\r\n\r\n    (2) If it contains a \"I\", in _either_ Cell, it is certainly\r\n    _occupied_, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the\r\n    Biliteral Diagram with a \"I\".\r\n\r\n    (3) If it contains _two_ \"O\"s, one in _each_ Cell, it is\r\n    certainly _empty_, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the\r\n    Biliteral Diagram with a \"O\".\r\n                                                                   pg054\r\n    (4) Deal in the same way with the N.E., the S.W., and the\r\n    S.E.

No x are y\".\r\n\r\n    As a second specimen, let us take the Trio\r\n\r\n        \"All cats understand French;\r\n         Some chickens are cats.\r\n             Some chickens understand French\".\r\n\r\n    These, put into normal form, are\r\n\r\n        \"All cats are creatures understanding French;\r\n         Some chickens are cats.\r\n             Some chickens are creatures understanding French\".\r\n\r\n    Here all the six Terms are Species of the Genus \"creatures.\"\r\n\r\n    Also the first and second Propositions contain the Pair of\r\n    codivisional Classes \"cats\" and \"cats\"; the first and third\r\n    contain the Pair \"creatures understanding French\" and \"creatures\r\n    understanding French\"; and the second and third contain the Pair\r\n    \"chickens\" and \"chickens\".\r\n                                                                   pg058\r\n    Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see at p. 64) so\r\n    related that, if the first two were true, the third would be\r\n    true. (The first two are, as it happens, _not_ strictly true in\r\n    _our_ planet. But there is nothing to hinder them from being\r\n    true in some _other_ planet, say _Mars_ or _Jupiter_--in which\r\n    case the third would _also_ be true in that planet, and its\r\n    inhabitants would probably engage chickens as\r\n    nursery-governesses.

We may take \"men\" as Univ., and\r\n    regard \"soldiers\" and \"brave men\" as _Species_ of the _Genus_\r\n    \"men\"; and we may choose x to represent the peculiar Attribute\r\n    (say \"military\") of \"soldiers,\" and y to represent \"brave.\" Then\r\n    the Proposition may be written \"Some military men are brave\r\n    men\"; _i.e._ \"Some x-men are y-men\"; _i.e._ (omitting \"men,\" as\r\n    explained at p. 26) \"Some x are y.\"\r\n\r\n    In practice, we should merely say \"Let Univ. be \"men\",\r\n    x = soldiers, y = brave\", and at once translate \"Some soldiers\r\n    are brave\" into \"Some x are y.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds, viz.\r\n\r\n(1) \"Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between\r\nthem a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as\r\nPremisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n(2) \"Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two\r\ncontain a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a\r\nSyllogism: to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent\r\nfrom the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is _complete_.\"\r\n\r\nThese Problems we will discuss separately.\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg060\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n_Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a\r\npair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to\r\nascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them._\r\n\r\nThe Rules, for doing this, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Determine the 'Universe of Discourse'.\r\n\r\n(2) Construct a Dictionary, making m and m (or m and m') represent the\r\npair of codivisional Classes, and x (or x') and y (or y') the other two.\r\n\r\n(3) Translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form.\r\n\r\n(4) Represent them, together, on a Triliteral Diagram.\r\n\r\n(5) Ascertain what Proposition, if any, in terms of x and y, is _also_\r\nrepresented on it.\r\n\r\n(6) Translate this into concrete form.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, if the proposed Premisses were true, this other\r\nProposition would _also_ be true. Hence it is a _Conclusion_ consequent\r\nfrom the proposed Premisses.\r\n\r\n    [Let us work some examples.\r\n\r\n    (1)\r\n\r\n        \"No son of mine is dishonest;\r\n         People always treat an honest man with respect\".\r\n\r\n    Taking \"men\" as Univ., we may write these as follows:--\r\n\r\n        \"No sons of mine are dishonest men;\r\n         All honest men are men treated with respect\".\r\n\r\n    We can now construct our Dictionary, viz. m = honest; x = sons\r\n    of mine; y = treated with respect.\r\n\r\n    (Note that the expression \"x = sons of mine\" is an abbreviated\r\n    form of \"x = the Differentia of 'sons of mine', when regarded as\r\n    a Species of 'men'\".)\r\n\r\n    The next thing is to translate the proposed Premisses into\r\n    abstract form, as follows:--\r\n\r\n        \"No x are m';\r\n         All m are y\".\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg061\r\n    Next, by the process described at p. 50, we represent these on a\r\n    Triliteral Diagram, thus:--\r\n\r\n        ·---------------·\r\n        |(O)    |    (O)|\r\n        |   ·---|---·   |\r\n        |   |   |(O)|   |\r\n        |---|(I)|---|---|\r\n        |   |   |(O)|   |\r\n        |   ·---|---·   |\r\n        |       |       |\r\n        ·---------------·\r\n\r\n    Next, by the process described at p. 53, we transfer to a\r\n    Biliteral Diagram all the information we can.\r\n\r\n        ·-------·\r\n        |   |(O)|\r\n        |---|---|\r\n        |   |   |\r\n        ·-------·\r\n\r\n    The result we read as \"No x are y'\" or as \"No y' are x,\"\r\n    whichever we prefer.

(See p. 31.) Hence it may be represented by the expression\r\n\"xy_{1}\".\r\n\r\nThe Converse Proposition \"Some y are x\" may of course be represented by\r\nthe _same_ expression, viz. \"xy_{1}\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse\r\nPropositions, viz.--\r\n\r\n    \"Some x are y'\"  = \"Some y' are x\",\r\n    \"Some x' are y\"  = \"Some y are x'\",\r\n    \"Some x' are y'\" = \"Some y' are x'\".\r\n\r\nLet us take, next, the Proposition \"No x are y\".\r\n\r\nThis, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence \"No xy\r\nexist\". (See p. 33.) Hence it may be represented by the expression\r\n\"xy_{0}\".\r\n\r\nThe Converse Proposition \"No y are x\" may of course be represented by\r\nthe _same_ expression, viz. \"xy_{0}\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse\r\nPropositions, viz.--\r\n\r\n    \"No x are y'\"  = \"No y' are x\",\r\n    \"No x' are y\"  = \"No y are x'\",\r\n    \"No x' are y'\" = \"No y' are x'\".\r\n                                                                   pg072\r\nLet us take, next, the Proposition \"All x are y\".\r\n\r\nNow it is evident that the Double Proposition of Existence \"Some x exist\r\nand no xy' exist\" tells us that _some_ x-Things exist, but that _none_\r\nof them have the Attribute y': that is, it tells us that _all_ of them\r\nhave the Attribute y: that is, it tells us that \"All x are y\".\r\n\r\nAlso it is evident that the expression \"x_{1} + xy'_{0}\" represents this\r\nDouble Proposition.\r\n\r\nHence it also represents the Proposition \"All x are y\".\r\n\r\n    [The Reader will perhaps be puzzled by the statement that the\r\n    Proposition \"All x are y\" is equivalent to the Double\r\n    Proposition \"Some x exist and no xy' exist,\" remembering that it\r\n    was stated, at p. 33, to be equivalent to the Double Proposition\r\n    \"Some x are y and no x are y'\" (i.e. \"Some xy exist and no xy'\r\n    exist\"). The explanation is that the Proposition \"Some xy exist\"\r\n    contains _superfluous information_. \"Some x exist\" is enough for\r\n    our purpose.]\r\n\r\nThis expression may be written in a shorter form, viz. \"x_{1}y'_{0}\",\r\nsince _each_ Subscript takes effect back to the _beginning_ of the\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions \"All x are\r\ny'\", \"All x' are y\", \"All x' are y'\", \"All y are x\", \"All y are x'\",\r\n\"All y' are x\", and \"All y' are x'\".\r\n\r\n    [The Reader should make out all these for himself.]\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to remember that, in translating a Proposition,\r\nbeginning with \"All\", from abstract form into subscript form, or _vice\r\nversâ_, the Predicate _changes sign_ (that is, changes from positive to\r\nnegative, or else from negative to positive).\r\n\r\n    [Thus, the Proposition \"All y are x'\" becomes \"y_{1}x_{0}\",\r\n    where the Predicate changes from x' to x.\r\n\r\n    Again, the expression \"x'_{1}y'_{0}\" becomes \"All x' are y\",\r\n    where the Predicate changes for y' to y.]\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg073\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_SYLLOGISMS._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\n_Representation of Syllogisms._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe already know how to represent each of the three Propositions of a\r\nSyllogism in subscript form. When that is done, all we need, besides, is\r\nto write the three expressions in a row, with \"+\" between the Premisses,\r\nand \"¶\" before the Conclusion.\r\n\r\n    [Thus the Syllogism\r\n\r\n        \"No x are m';\r\n         All m are y.\r\n             .'. No x are y'.\"\r\n\r\n    may be represented thus:--\r\n\r\n        xm'_{0} + m_{1}y'_{0} ¶ xy'_{0}\r\n\r\n    When a Proposition has to be translated from concrete form into\r\n    subscript form, the Reader will find it convenient, just at\r\n    first, to translate it into _abstract_ form, and _thence_ into\r\n    subscript form. But, after a little practice, he will find it\r\n    quite easy to go straight from concrete form to subscript form.]\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg074\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n_Formulæ for solving Problems in Syllogisms._\r\n\r\nWhen once we have found, by Diagrams, the Conclusion to a given Pair of\r\nPremisses, and have represented the Syllogism in subscript form, we have\r\na _Formula_, by which we can at once find, without having to use\r\nDiagrams again, the Conclusion to any _other_ Pair of Premisses having\r\nthe _same_ subscript forms.\r\n\r\n    [Thus, the expression\r\n\r\n        xm_{0} + ym'_{0} ¶ xy_{0}\r\n\r\n    is a Formula, by which we can find the Conclusion to any Pair of\r\n    Premisses whose subscript forms are\r\n\r\n        xm_{0} + ym'_{0}\r\n\r\n    For example, suppose we had the Pair of Propositions\r\n\r\n        \"No gluttons are healthy;\r\n         No unhealthy men are strong\".\r\n\r\n    proposed as Premisses. Taking \"men\" as our 'Universe', and\r\n    making m = healthy; x = gluttons; y = strong; we might translate\r\n    the Pair into abstract form, thus:--\r\n\r\n        \"No x are m;\r\n         No m' are y\".\r\n\r\n    These, in subscript form, would be\r\n\r\n        xm_{0} + m'y_{0}\r\n\r\n    which are identical with those in our _Formula_. Hence we at\r\n    once know the Conclusion to be\r\n\r\n        xy_{0}\r\n\r\n    that is, in abstract form,\r\n\r\n        \"No x are y\";\r\n\r\n    that is, in concrete form,\r\n\r\n        \"No gluttons are strong\".]\r\n\r\nI shall now take three different forms of Pairs of Premisses, and work\r\nout their Conclusions, once for all, by Diagrams; and thus obtain some\r\nuseful Formulæ. I shall call them \"Fig. I\", \"Fig. II\", and \"Fig. III\".\r\n                                                                   pg075\r\nFig. I.\r\n\r\nThis includes any Pair of Premisses which are

Conclusion is a Nullity, and that the\r\nRetinends have kept their Signs.\r\n\r\nAnd we should find this Rule to hold good with _any_ Pair of Premisses\r\nwhich fulfil the given conditions.\r\n\r\n    [The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out,\r\n    on Diagrams, several varieties, such as\r\n\r\n        m_{1}x_{0} + ym'_{0} (which ¶ xy_{0})\r\n        xm'_{0} + m_{1}y_{0}

it\r\nmay be so asserted in the _Conclusion_.\r\n\r\nHence we get two _Variants_ of Fig. I, viz.\r\n\r\n(a) where _one_ Retinend is so asserted;\r\n\r\n(b) where _both_ are so asserted.\r\n\r\n

Hence, in order to keep them distinct, I\r\npropose to record the Formulæ for _Fallacies_ in _words_, and to call\r\nthem \"Forms\" instead of \"Formulæ.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to find, by the Method of Diagrams, three \"Forms of\r\nFallacies,\" which we will then put on record for future use. They are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist.\r\n    (2) Fallacy of Unlike Eliminands with an Entity-Premiss.\r\n    (3) Fallacy of two Entity-Premisses.\r\n\r\nThese shall be discussed separately, and it will be seen that each fails\r\nto yield a Conclusion.\r\n\r\n(1) _Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist._\r\n\r\nIt is evident that neither of the given Propositions can be an _Entity_,\r\nsince that kind asserts the _existence_ of both of its Terms (see p.\r\n20).

(See p. 75.) Those, that require _other_ Formulæ,\r\nare rather too hard for beginners.\r\n\r\nSuch Problems may be solved by either of two Methods, viz.\r\n\r\n    (1) The Method of Separate Syllogisms;\r\n    (2) The Method of Underscoring.\r\n\r\nThese shall be discussed separately.\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg088\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n_Solution by Method of Separate Syllogisms._\r\n\r\nThe Rules, for doing this, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Name the 'Universe of Discourse'.\r\n\r\n    (2) Construct a Dictionary, making a, b, c, &c. represent\r\n    the Terms.\r\n\r\n    (3) Put the Proposed Premisses into subscript form.\r\n\r\n    (4) Select two which, containing between them a pair of\r\n    codivisional Classes, can be used as the Premisses of a\r\n    Syllogism.\r\n\r\n    (5) Find their Conclusion by Formula.\r\n\r\n    (6) Find a third Premiss which, along with this Conclusion,\r\n    can be used as the Premisses of a second Syllogism.\r\n\r\n    (7) Find a second Conclusion by Formula.\r\n\r\n    (8) Proceed thus, until all the proposed Premisses have\r\n    been used.\r\n\r\n    (9) Put the last Conclusion, which is the Complete\r\n    Conclusion of the Sorites, into concrete form.\r\n\r\n    [As an example of this process, let us take, as the proposed Set\r\n    of Premisses,\r\n\r\n        (1) \"All the policemen on this beat sup with our cook;\r\n        (2)  No man with long hair can fail to be a poet;\r\n        (3)  Amos Judd has never been in prison;\r\n        (4)  Our cook's 'cousins' all love cold mutton;\r\n        (5)  None but policemen on this beat are poets;\r\n        (6)  None but her 'cousins' ever sup with our cook;\r\n        (7)  Men with short hair have all been in prison.\"\r\n\r\n    Univ. \"men\"; a = Amos Judd; b = cousins of our cook; c = having\r\n    been in prison; d = long-haired; e = loving cold mutton;\r\n    h = poets; k = policemen on this beat; l = supping with our cook\r\n                                                                   pg089\r\n    We now have to put the proposed Premisses into _subscript_ form.\r\n    Let us begin by putting them into _abstract_ form. The result is\r\n\r\n        (1) \"All k are l;\r\n        (2)  No d are h';\r\n        (3)  All a are c';\r\n        (4)  All b are e;\r\n        (5)  No k' are h;\r\n        (6)  No b' are l;\r\n        (7)  All d' are c.\"\r\n\r\n    And it is now easy to put them into _subscript_ form, as\r\n    follows:--\r\n\r\n        (1) k_{1}l'_{0}\r\n        (2) dh'_{0}\r\n        (3) a_{1}c_{0}\r\n        (4) b_{1}e'_{0}\r\n        (5) k'h_{0}\r\n        (6) b'l_{0}\r\n        (7) d'_{1}c'_{0}\r\n\r\n    We now have to find a pair of Premisses which will yield a\r\n    Conclusion. Let us begin with No. (1), and look down the list,\r\n    till we come to one which we can take along with it, so as to\r\n    form Premisses belonging to Fig. I. We find that No. (5) will\r\n    do, since we can take k as our Eliminand. So our first syllogism\r\n    is\r\n\r\n        (1) k_{1}l'_{0}\r\n        (5) k'h_{0}\r\n            .'. l'h_{0} ... (8)\r\n\r\n    We must now begin again with l'h_{0} and find a Premiss to go\r\n    along with it. We find that No. (2) will do, h being our\r\n    Eliminand. So our next Syllogism is\r\n\r\n        (8) l'h_{0}\r\n        (2) dh'_{0}\r\n            .'. l'd_{0} ... (9)\r\n\r\n    We have now used up Nos. (1), (5), and (2), and must search\r\n    among the others for a partner for l'd_{0}. We find that No. (6)\r\n    will do. So we write\r\n\r\n        (9) l'd_{0}\r\n        (6) b'l_{0}\r\n            .'. db'_{0} ... (10)\r\n\r\n    Now what can we take along with db'_{0}?

The first line will consist of the above\r\n    Data; the second must be composed, bit by bit, according to the\r\n    following directions.\r\n\r\n    We begin by writing down the first Premiss, with its numeral\r\n    over it, but omitting the subscripts.\r\n\r\n    We have now to find a Premiss which can be combined with this,\r\n    _i.e._, a Premiss containing either k' or l. The first we find\r\n    is No. 5; and this we tack on, with a +.\r\n\r\n    To get the _Conclusion_ from these, k and k' must be eliminated,\r\n    and what remains must be taken as one expression. So we\r\n    _underscore_ them, putting a _single_ score under k, and a\r\n    _double_ one under k'. The result we read as l'h.\r\n\r\n    We must now find a Premiss containing either l or h'. Looking\r\n    along the row, we fix on No. 2, and tack it on.\r\n\r\n    Now these 3 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'h + dh'), in\r\n    which h and h' must be eliminated, and what remains taken as one\r\n    expression. So we _underscore_ them. The result reads as l'd.\r\n\r\n    We now want a Premiss containing l or d'. No. 6 will do.\r\n\r\n    These 4 Nullities are really equivalent to (l'd + b'l). So we\r\n    underscore l' and l. The result reads as db'.\r\n\r\n    We now want a Premiss containing d' or b. No. 4 will do.\r\n\r\n    Here we underscore b' and b. The result reads as de'.\r\n\r\n    We now want a Premiss containing d' or e. No. 7 will do.\r\n\r\n    Here we underscore d and d'. The result reads as c'e'.\r\n\r\n    We now want a Premiss containing c or e. No. 3 will do--in fact\r\n    _must_ do, as it is the only one left.\r\n\r\n    Here we underscore c' and c; and, as the whole thing now reads\r\n    as e'a, we tack on e'a_{0} as the _Conclusion_, with a ¶.\r\n\r\n    We now look along the row of Data, to see whether e' or a has\r\n    been given as _existent_.

The Univ. is \"persons.\" The Individual \"I\" may be regarded as a\r\nClass, of persons, whose peculiar Attribute is \"represented by the Name\r\n'I'\", and may be called the Class of \"I's\". It is evident that this\r\nClass cannot possibly contain more than one Member: hence the Sign of\r\nQuantity is \"all\". The verb \"have been\" may be replaced by the phrase\r\n\"are persons who have been\". The Proposition may be written thus:--\r\n\r\n\"All\"                                       _Sign of Quantity_.\r\n\"I's\"                                       _Subject_.\r\n\"are\"                                       _Copula_.\r\n\"persons who have been out for a walk\"      _Predicate_.\r\n\r\nor, more briefly,\r\n\r\n    \"All | I's | are | persons who have been out for a walk\".\r\n\r\n2. The Univ. and the Subject are the same as in Ex. 1. The Proposition\r\nmay be written\r\n\r\n    \"All | I's | are | persons who feel better\".\r\n\r\n3. Univ. is \"persons\". The Subject is evidently the Class of persons\r\nfrom which John is _excluded_; _i.e._ it is the Class containing all\r\npersons who are _not_ \"John\".\r\n\r\nThe Sign of Quantity is \"no\".\r\n\r\nThe verb \"has read\" may be replaced by the phrase \"are persons who have\r\nread\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"No | persons who are not 'John' | are | persons who have read the\r\n    letter\".\r\n\r\n4.

Univ. is \"persons\". The Subject is evidently the Class of persons who\r\nare _not_ brave.\r\n\r\nThe verb \"deserve\" may be replaced by the phrase \"are deserving of\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair\".\r\n\r\n7. Univ. is \"persons\". The phrase \"looks poetical\" evidently belongs to\r\nthe _Predicate_; and the _Subject_ is the Class, of persons, whose\r\npeculiar Attribute is \"_not_-pale\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"No | not-pale persons | are | persons who look poetical\".\r\n\r\n8. Univ. is \"persons\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"Some | judges | are | persons who lose their tempers\".\r\n\r\n9. Univ. is \"persons\".

Univ. is \"things\". The phrase \"what is difficult\" (_i.e._ \"that\r\nwhich is difficult\") is equivalent to the phrase \"all difficult things\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"All | difficult things | are | things that need attention\".\r\n\r\n11. Univ. is \"things\". The phrase \"what is unwholesome\" may be\r\ninterpreted as in Ex. 10.\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"All | unwholesome things | are | things that should be avoided\".\r\n\r\n12. Univ. is \"laws\". The Predicate is evidently a Class whose peculiar\r\nAttribute is \"relating to excise\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"All | laws passed last week | are | laws relating to excise\".\r\n\r\n13. Univ. is \"things\". The Subject is evidently the Class, of studies,\r\nwhose peculiar Attribute is \"logical\"; hence the Sign of Quantity is\r\n\"all\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"All | logical studies | are | things that puzzle me\".\r\n\r\n14. Univ. is \"persons\". The Subject is evidently \"persons in the house\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"No | persons in the house | are | Jews\".\r\n\r\n15. Univ. is \"dishes\". The phrase \"if not well-cooked\" is equivalent to\r\nthe Attribute \"not well-cooked\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"Some | not well-cooked dishes | are | unwholesome dishes\".\r\n                                                                   pg136\r\n16.

Univ. is \"men\". The Subject is evidently \"a man who knows what he's\r\nabout\"; and the word \"when\" shows that the Proposition is asserted of\r\n_every_ such man, _i.e._ of _all_ such men. The verb \"can\" may be\r\nreplaced by \"are men who can\".\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"All | men who know what they're about | are | men who can detect a\r\n    sharper\".\r\n\r\n18. The Univ. and the Subject are the same as in Ex. 4.\r\n\r\nThe Proposition may be written\r\n\r\n    \"All | Members of the Class 'you and I' | are | persons who know\r\n    what they're about\".\r\n\r\n19.

Quarter, while the Premiss ym_{0} empties its _Outer_ Cell. Hence\r\nit needs the _two_ Premisses to empty the _whole_ of the N.W. Quarter,\r\nand thus to prove the Conclusion xy_{0}.\r\n\r\nAgain, in Fig. II., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the Inner Cell of the\r\nN.W. Quarter. The Premiss ym_{1} merely tells us that the Inner Portion\r\nof the W. Half is _occupied_, so that we may place a 'I' in it,\r\n_somewhere_; but, if this were the _whole_ of our information, we should\r\nnot know in _which_ Cell to place it, so that it would have to 'sit on\r\nthe fence': it is only when we learn, from the other Premiss, that the\r\n_upper_ of these two Cells is _empty_, that we feel authorised to place\r\nthe 'I' in the _lower_ Cell, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y_{1}.\r\n\r\nLastly, in Fig. III., the information, that m _exists_, merely\r\nauthorises us to place a 'I' _somewhere_ in the Inner Square----but it\r\nhas large choice of fences to sit upon! It needs the Premiss xm_{0} to\r\ndrive it out of the N. Half of that Square; and it needs the Premiss\r\nym_{0} to drive it out of the W. Half. Hence it needs the _two_\r\nPremisses to drive it into the Inner Portion of the S.E. Quarter, and\r\nthus to prove the Conclusion x'y'_{1}.\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg165\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX,\r\n\r\nADDRESSED TO TEACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\n_Introductory._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several matters, too hard to discuss with _Learners_, which\r\nnevertheless need to be explained to any _Teachers_, into whose hands\r\nthis book may fall, in order that they may thoroughly understand what my\r\nSymbolic Method _is_, and in what respects it differs from the many\r\nother Methods already published.\r\n\r\nThese matters are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The \"Existential Import\" of Propositions.\r\n    The use of \"is-not\" (or \"are-not\") as a Copula.\r\n    The theory \"two Negative Premisses prove nothing.\"\r\n    Euler's Method of Diagrams.\r\n    Venn's Method of Diagrams.\r\n    My Method of Diagrams.\r\n    The Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods.\r\n    My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites.\r\n    Some account of Parts II, III.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n_The \"Existential Import\" of Propositions._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writers, and editors, of the Logical text-books which run in the\r\nordinary grooves----to whom I shall hereafter refer by the (I hope\r\ninoffensive) title \"The Logicians\"----take, on this subject, what seems\r\nto me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary. They speak\r\nof the Copula of a Proposition \"with bated breath\", almost as if it were\r\na living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it\r\nchose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but\r\nto ascertain _what_ was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to\r\nit.\r\n                                                                   pg166\r\nIn opposition to this view, I maintain that any writer of a book is\r\nfully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase\r\nhe intends to use. If I find an author saying, at the beginning of his\r\nbook, \"Let it be understood that by the word '_black_' I shall always\r\nmean '_white_', and that by the word '_white_' I shall always mean\r\n'_black_',\" I meekly accept his ruling, however injudicious I may think\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with regard to the question whether a Proposition is or is not\r\nto be understood as asserting the existence of its Subject, I maintain\r\nthat every writer may adopt his own rule, provided of course that it is\r\nconsistent with itself and with the accepted facts of Logic.\r\n\r\nLet us consider certain views that may _logically_ be held, and thus\r\nsettle which of them may _conveniently_ be held; after which I shall\r\nhold myself free to declare which of them _I_ intend to hold.\r\n\r\nThe _kinds_ of Propositions, to be considered, are those that begin with\r\n\"some\", with \"no\", and with \"all\". These are usually called Propositions\r\n\"in _I_\", \"in _E_\", and \"in _A_\".\r\n\r\nFirst, then, a Proposition in _I_ may be understood as asserting, or\r\nelse as _not_ asserting, the existence of its Subject. (By \"existence\" I\r\nmean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature. The two\r\nPropositions, \"_dreams_ exist\" and \"_drums_ exist\", denote two totally\r\ndifferent kinds of \"existence\". A _dream_ is an aggregate of ideas, and\r\nexists only in the _mind of a dreamer_: whereas a _drum_ is an aggregate\r\nof wood and parchment, and exists in _the hands of a drummer_.)\r\n\r\nFirst, let us suppose that _I_ \"asserts\" (i.e. \"asserts the existence of\r\nits Subject\").\r\n\r\nHere, of course, we must regard a Proposition in _A_ as making the\r\n_same_ assertion, since it necessarily _contains_ a Proposition in _I_.\r\n\r\nWe now have _I_ and _A_ \"asserting\". Does this leave us free to make\r\nwhat supposition we choose as to _E_? My answer is \"No. We are tied down\r\nto the supposition that _E_ does _not_ assert.\" This can be proved as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nIf possible, let _E_ \"assert\". Then (taking x, y, and z to represent\r\nAttributes) we see that, if the Proposition \"No xy are z\" be true, some\r\nthings exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e. \"Some x are y.\"\r\n                                                                   pg167\r\nAlso we know that, if the Proposition \"Some xy are z\" be true, the same\r\nresult follows.\r\n\r\nBut these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of\r\nthem _must_ be true. Hence this result is _always_ true: i.e. the\r\nProposition \"Some x are y\" is _always_ true!\r\n\r\n_Quod est absurdum._ (See Note (A), p. 195).\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the supposition \"_I_ asserts\" necessarily leads to\r\n\"_A_ asserts, but _E_ does not\". And this is the _first_ of the various\r\nviews that may conceivably be held.\r\n\r\nNext, let us suppose that _I_ does _not_ \"assert.\" And, along with this,\r\nlet us take the supposition that _E_ _does_ \"assert.\"\r\n\r\nHence the Proposition \"No x are y\" means \"Some x exist, and none of them\r\nare y\": i.e. \"_all_ of them are _not_-y,\" which is a Proposition in _A_.\r\nWe also know, of course, that the Proposition \"All x are not-y\" proves\r\n\"No x are y.\" Now two Propositions, each of which proves the other, are\r\n_equivalent_. Hence every Proposition in _A_ is equivalent to one in\r\n_E_, and therefore \"_asserts_\".\r\n\r\nHence our _second_ conceivable view is \"_E_ and _A_ assert, but _I_ does\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nThis view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with\r\nitself or with the accepted facts of Logic. But, when we come to _test_\r\nit, as applied to the actual _facts_ of life, we shall find I think,\r\nthat it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, to say\r\nthe least of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk.\r\n\r\nLet me record a little dialogue I have just held with my friend Jones,\r\nwho is trying to form a new Club, to be regulated on strictly _Logical_\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n_Author._ \"Well, Jones! Have you got your new Club started yet?\"\r\n\r\n_Jones_ (_rubbing his hands_). \"You'll be glad to hear that some of the\r\nMembers (mind, I only say '_some_') are millionaires! Rolling in gold,\r\nmy boy!\"\r\n\r\n_Author._ \"That sounds well. And how many Members have entered?\"\r\n\r\n_Jones_ (_staring_). \"None at all. We haven't got it started yet. What\r\nmakes you think we have?\"\r\n\r\n_Author._ \"Why, I thought you said that some of the Members----\"\r\n                                                                   pg168\r\n_Jones_ (_contemptuously_). \"You don't seem to be aware that we're\r\nworking on strictly _Logical_ principles. A _Particular_ Proposition\r\ndoes _not_ assert the existence of its Subject. I merely meant to say\r\nthat we've made a Rule not to admit _any_ Members till we have at least\r\n_three_ Candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year!\"\r\n\r\n_Author._ \"Oh, _that's_ what you meant, is it? Let's hear some more of\r\nyour Rules.\"\r\n\r\n_Jones._ \"Another is, that no one, who has been convicted seven times of\r\nforgery, is admissible.\"\r\n\r\n_Author._ \"And here, again, I suppose you don't mean to assert there\r\n_are_ any such convicts in existence?\"\r\n\r\n_Jones._ \"Why, that's exactly what I _do_ mean to assert! Don't you know\r\nthat a Universal Negative _asserts_ the existence of its Subject? _Of\r\ncourse_ we didn't make that Rule till we had satisfied ourselves that\r\nthere are several such convicts now living.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reader can now decide for himself how far this _second_ conceivable\r\nview would fit in with the facts of life. He will, I think, agree with\r\nme that Jones' view, of the 'Existential Import' of Propositions, would\r\nlead to some inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThirdly, let us suppose that neither _I_ nor _E_ \"asserts\".\r\n\r\nNow the supposition that the two Propositions, \"Some x are y\" and \"No x\r\nare not-y\", do _not_ \"assert\", necessarily involves the supposition that\r\n\"All x are y\" does _not_ \"assert\", since it would be absurd to suppose\r\nthat they assert, when combined, more than they do when taken\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nHence the _third_ (and last) of the conceivable views is that neither\r\n_I_, nor _E_, nor _A_, \"asserts\".\r\n\r\nThe advocates of this third view would interpret the Proposition \"Some x\r\nare y\" to mean \"If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_\r\nbe y\"; and so with _E_ and _A_.\r\n\r\nIt admits of proof that this view, as regards _A_, conflicts with the\r\naccepted facts of Logic.\r\n\r\nLet us take the Syllogism _Darapti_, which is universally accepted as\r\nvalid. Its form is\r\n\r\n    \"All m are x;\r\n     All m are y.\r\n         .'. Some y are x\".\r\n                                                                   pg169\r\nThis they would interpret as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"If there were any m in existence, all of them would be x;\r\n     If there were any m in existence, all of them would be y.\r\n         .'. If there were any y in existence, some of them\r\n               would be x\".\r\n\r\nThat this Conclusion does _not_ follow has been so briefly and clearly\r\nexplained by Mr. Keynes (in his \"Formal Logic\", dated 1894, pp. 356,\r\n357), that I prefer to quote his words:--\r\n\r\n\"_Let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its\r\npredicate._\r\n\r\n\"Take, as an example, a syllogism in _Darapti_:--\r\n\r\n    '_All M is P_,\r\n     _All M is S_,\r\n          _.'. Some S is P_.'\r\n\r\n\"Taking S, M, P, as the minor, middle, and major terms respectively, the\r\nconclusion will imply that, if there is an S, there is some P. Will the\r\npremisses also imply this? If so, then the syllogism is valid; but not\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\"The conclusion implies that if S exists P exists; but, consistently\r\nwith the premisses, S may be existent while M and P are both\r\nnon-existent. An implication is, therefore, contained in the conclusion,\r\nwhich is not justified by the premisses.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems to _me_ entirely clear and convincing. Still, \"to make\r\nsicker\", I may as well throw the above (_soi-disant_) Syllogism into a\r\nconcrete form, which will be within the grasp of even a _non_-logical\r\nReader.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a Boys' School has been set up, with the following\r\nsystem of Rules:--\r\n\r\n\"All boys in the First (the highest) Class are to do French, Greek, and\r\nLatin. All in the Second Class are to do Greek only. All in the Third\r\nClass are to do Latin only.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose also that there _are_ boys in the Third Class, and in the\r\nSecond; but that no boy has yet risen into the First.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there are no boys in the School doing French: still\r\nwe know, by the Rules, what would happen if there _were_ any.\r\n                                                                   pg170\r\nWe are authorised, then, by the _Data_, to assert the following two\r\nPropositions:--\r\n\r\n    \"If there were any boys doing French, all of them would\r\n       be doing Greek;\r\n     If there were any boys doing French, all of them would\r\n       be doing Latin.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Conclusion, according to \"The Logicians\" would be\r\n\r\n    \"If there were any boys doing Latin, some of them would\r\n       be doing Greek.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have two _true_ Premisses and a _false_ Conclusion (since\r\nwe know that there _are_ boys doing Latin, and that _none_ of them are\r\ndoing Greek). Hence the argument is _invalid_.\r\n\r\nSimilarly it may be shown that this \"non-existential\" interpretation\r\ndestroys the validity of _Disamis_, _Datisi_, _Felapton_, and\r\n_Fresison_.\r\n\r\nSome of \"The Logicians\" will, no doubt, be ready to reply \"But we are\r\nnot _Aldrichians_! Why should _we_ be responsible for the validity of\r\nthe Syllogisms of so antiquated an author as Aldrich?\"\r\n\r\nVery good. Then, for the _special_ benefit of these \"friends\" of mine\r\n(with what ominous emphasis that name is sometimes used! \"I must have a\r\nprivate interview with _you_, my young _friend_,\" says the bland Dr.\r\nBirch, \"in my library, at 9 a.m. tomorrow. And you will please to be\r\n_punctual_!\"), for their _special_ benefit, I say, I will produce\r\n_another_ charge against this \"non-existential\" interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt actually invalidates the ordinary Process of \"Conversion\", as applied\r\nto Proposition in '_I_'.\r\n\r\n_Every_ logician, Aldrichian or otherwise, accepts it as an established\r\nfact that \"Some x are y\" may be legitimately converted into \"Some y are\r\nx.\"\r\n\r\nBut is it equally clear that the Proposition \"If there _were_ any x,\r\nsome of them _would_ be y\" may be legitimately converted into \"If there\r\n_were_ any y, some of them would be x\"? I trow not.\r\n\r\nThe example I have already used----of a Boys' School with a non-existent\r\nFirst Class----will serve admirably to illustrate this new flaw in the\r\ntheory of \"The Logicians.\"\r\n                                                                   pg171\r\nLet us suppose that there is yet _another_ Rule in this School, viz. \"In\r\neach Class, at the end of the Term, the head boy and the second boy\r\nshall receive prizes.\"\r\n\r\nThis Rule entirely authorises us to assert (in the sense in which \"The\r\nLogicians\" would use the words) \"Some boys in the First Class will\r\nreceive prizes\", for this simply means (according to them) \"If there\r\n_were_ any boys in the First Class, some of them _would_ receive\r\nprizes.\"\r\n\r\nNow the Converse of this Proposition is, of course, \"Some boys, who will\r\nreceive prizes, are in the First Class\", which means (according to \"The\r\nLogicians\") \"If there _were_ any boys about to receive prizes, some of\r\nthem _would_ be in the First Class\" (which Class we know to be _empty_).\r\n\r\nOf this Pair of Converse Propositions, the first is undoubtedly _true_:\r\nthe second, _as_ undoubtedly, _false_.\r\n\r\nIt is always sad to see a batsman knock down his own wicket: one pities\r\nhim, as a man and a brother, but, as a _cricketer_, one can but\r\npronounce him \"Out!\"\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that, among all the conceivable views we have here\r\nconsidered, there are only _two_ which can _logically_ be held, viz.\r\n\r\n    _I_ and _A_ \"assert\", but _E_ does not.\r\n    _E_ and _A_ \"assert\", but _I_ does not.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ of these I have shown to involve great practical\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ is the one adopted in this book. (See p. 19.)\r\n\r\nSome further remarks on this subject will be found in Note (B), at p.\r\n196.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\n_The use of \"is-not\" (or \"are-not\") as a Copula._\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it better to say \"John _is-not_ in-the-house\" or \"John _is_\r\nnot-in-the-house\"? \"Some of my acquaintances _are-not_\r\nmen-I-should-like-to-be-seen-with\" or \"Some of my acquaintances _are_\r\nmen-I-should-_not_-like-to-be-seen-with\"? That is the sort of question\r\nwe have now to discuss.\r\n                                                                   pg172\r\nThis is no question of Logical Right and Wrong: it is merely a matter of\r\n_taste_, since the two forms mean exactly the same thing. And here,\r\nagain, \"The Logicians\" seem to me to take much too humble a position.\r\nWhen they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their\r\nProposition, just before the curtain goes up, and when the\r\nCopula----always a rather fussy 'heavy father', asks them \"Am _I_ to\r\nhave the 'not', or will you tack it on to the Predicate?\" they are much\r\ntoo ready to answer, like the subtle cab-driver, \"Leave it to _you_,\r\nSir!\" The result seems to be, that the grasping Copula constantly gets a\r\n\"not\" that had better have been merged in the Predicate, and that\r\nPropositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as\r\nprecisely similar. Surely it is simpler to treat \"Some men are Jews\" and\r\n\"Some men are Gentiles\" as being both of them, _affirmative_\r\nPropositions, instead of translating the latter into \"Some men are-not\r\nJews\", and regarding it as a _negative_ Propositions?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, \"The Logicians\" have somehow acquired a perfectly _morbid_\r\ndread of negative Attributes, which makes them shut their eyes, like\r\nfrightened children, when they come across such terrible Propositions as\r\n\"All not-x are y\"; and thus they exclude from their system many very\r\nuseful forms of Syllogisms.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this unreasoning terror, they plead that, in\r\nDichotomy by Contradiction, the _negative_ part is too large to deal\r\nwith, so that it is better to regard each Thing as either included in,\r\nor excluded from, the _positive_ part. I see no force in this plea: and\r\nthe facts often go the other way. As a personal question, dear Reader,\r\nif _you_ were to group your acquaintances into the two Classes, men that\r\nyou _would_ like to be seen with, and men that you would _not_ like to\r\nbe seen with, do you think the latter group would be so _very_ much the\r\nlarger of the two?\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of Symbolic Logic, it is so _much_ the most convenient\r\nplan to regard the two sub-divisions, produced by Dichotomy, on the\r\n_same_ footing, and to say, of any Thing, either that it \"is\" in the\r\none, or that it \"is\" in the other, that I do not think any Reader of\r\nthis book is likely to demur to my adopting that course.\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg173\r\n§ 4.\r\n\r\n_The theory that \"two Negative Premisses prove nothing\"._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis I consider to be _another_ craze of \"The Logicians\", fully as\r\nmorbid as their dread of a negative Attribute.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, best refuted by the method of _Instantia Contraria_.\r\n\r\nTake the following Pairs of Premisses:--\r\n\r\n    \"None of my boys are conceited;\r\n     None of my girls are greedy\".\r\n\r\n    \"None of my boys are clever;\r\n     None but a clever boy could solve this problem\".\r\n\r\n    \"None of my boys are learned;\r\n     Some of my boys are not choristers\".\r\n\r\n(This last Proposition is, in _my_ system, an _affirmative_ one, since I\r\nshould read it \"are not-choristers\"; but, in dealing with \"The\r\nLogicians,\" I may fairly treat it as a _negative_ one, since _they_\r\nwould read it \"are-not choristers\".)\r\n\r\nIf you, dear Reader, declare, after full consideration of these Pairs of\r\nPremisses, that you cannot deduce a Conclusion from _any_ of\r\nthem----why, all I can say is that, like the Duke in Patience, you \"will\r\nhave to be contented with our heart-felt sympathy\"! [See Note (C), p.\r\n196.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5.\r\n\r\n_Euler's Method of Diagrams._\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagrams seem to have been used, at first, to represent _Propositions_\r\nonly. In Euler's well-known Circles, each was supposed to contain a\r\nclass, and the Diagram consisted of two circles, which exhibited the\r\nrelations, as to inclusion and exclusion, existing between the two\r\nClasses.\r\n\r\n        _____\r\n      _/ ___ \\_\r\n     /  / y \\  \\\r\n    |   \\___/   |\r\n     \\_   x   _/\r\n       \\_____/\r\n\r\nThus, the Diagram, here given, exhibits the two Classes, whose\r\nrespective Attributes are x and y, as so related to each other that the\r\nfollowing Propositions are all simultaneously true:--\"All x are y\", \"No\r\nx are not-y\", \"Some x are y\", \"Some y are not-x\", \"Some not-y are\r\nnot-x\", and, of course, the Converses of the last four.\r\n                                                                   pg174\r\n        _____\r\n      _/ ___ \\_\r\n     /  / y \\  \\\r\n    |   \\___/   |\r\n     \\_   x   _/\r\n       \\_____/\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with this Diagram, the following Propositions are true:--\"All\r\ny are x\", \"No y are not-x\", \"Some y are x\", \"Some x are not-y\", \"Some\r\nnot-x are not-y\", and, of course, the Converses of the last four.\r\n\r\n        _____           _____\r\n      _/     \\_       _/     \\_\r\n     /         \\     /         \\\r\n    |     x     |   |     y     |\r\n     \\_       _/     \\_       _/\r\n       \\_____/         \\_____/\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:--\"All x are\r\nnot-y\", \"All y are not-x\", \"No x are y\", \"Some x are not-y\", \"Some y are\r\nnot-x\", \"Some not-x are not-y\", and the Converses of the last four.\r\n\r\n        _____   _____\r\n      _/     \\_/     \\_\r\n     /       / \\       \\\r\n    |     x |   | y     |\r\n     \\_      \\_/      _/\r\n       \\_____/ \\_____/\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:--\"Some x are y\",\r\n\"Some x are not-y\", \"Some not-x are y\", \"Some not-x are not-y\", and of\r\ncourse, their four Converses.\r\n\r\nNote that _all_ Euler's Diagrams assert \"Some not-x are not-y.\"\r\nApparently it never occured to him that it might _sometimes_ fail to be\r\ntrue!\r\n\r\nNow, to represent \"All x are y\", the _first_ of these Diagrams would\r\nsuffice. Similarly, to represent \"No x are y\", the _third_ would\r\nsuffice. But to represent any _Particular_ Proposition, at least _three_\r\nDiagrams would be needed (in order to include all the possible cases),\r\nand, for \"Some not-x are not-y\", all the _four_.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6.\r\n\r\n_Venn's Method of Diagrams._\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us represent \"not-x\" by \"x'\".\r\n\r\nMr. Venn's Method of Diagrams is a great advance on the above Method.\r\n\r\nHe uses the last of the above Diagrams to represent _any_ desired\r\nrelation between x and y, by simply shading a Compartment known to be\r\n_empty_, and placing a + in one known to be _occupied_.\r\n\r\nThus, he would represent the three Propositions \"Some x are y\", \"No x\r\nare y\", and \"All x are y\", as follows:--\r\n\r\n        _____   _____\r\n      _/     \\_/     \\_\r\n     /       / \\       \\\r\n    |       | + |       |\r\n     \\_      \\_/      _/\r\n       \\_____/ \\_____/\r\n\r\n        _____   _____\r\n      _/     \\_/     \\_\r\n     /       /#\\       \\\r\n    |       |###|       |\r\n     \\_      \\#/      _/\r\n       \\_____/ \\_____/\r\n\r\n        _____   _____\r\n      _/#####\\_/     \\_\r\n     /#######/ \\       \\\r\n    |#######| + |       |\r\n     \\#######\\_/      _/\r\n       \\#####/ \\_____/\r\n                                                                   pg175\r\nIt will be seen that, of the _four_ Classes, whose peculiar Sets of\r\nAttributes are xy, xy', x'y, and x'y', only _three_ are here provided\r\nwith closed Compartments, while the _fourth_ is allowed the rest of the\r\nInfinite Plane to range about in!\r\n\r\nThis arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble, if we ever\r\nattempted to represent \"No x' are y'.\" Mr. Venn _once_ (at p. 281)\r\nencounters this awful task; but evades it, in a quite masterly fashion,\r\nby the simple foot-note \"We have not troubled to shade the outside of\r\nthis diagram\"!\r\n\r\nTo represent _two_ Propositions (containing a common Term) _together_, a\r\n_three_-letter Diagram is needed.

It must be admitted that such a\r\ndiagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be; but\r\nthen consider what the alternative is of one undertakes to deal with\r\nfive terms and all their combinations--nothing short of the disagreeable\r\ntask of writing out, or in some way putting before us, all the 32\r\ncombinations involved.\"\r\n\r\n                   b      c      d\r\n                 ______  ____  ______\r\n          ______/_     \\/    \\/     _\\______\r\n      a  /     /  \\    /\\    /\\    /  \\     \\  e\r\n        /     /    \\  /  \\  /  \\  /    \\     \\\r\n       /      \\     \\/    \\/    \\/     /      \\\r\n      /        \\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /        \\\r\n     /          \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /          \\\r\n    |            \\/    \\/ __ \\/    \\/            |\r\n    |            /\\    /\\/  \\/\\    /\\            |\r\n    |           /  \\  / /\\  /\\ \\  /  \\           |\r\n    |          |    \\/ |  \\/  | \\/    |          |\r\n    |          |    /\\ |  /\\  | /\\    |          |\r\n    |           \\  /  \\ \\/  \\/ /  \\  /           |\r\n     \\           \\/    \\/\\__/\\/    \\/           /\r\n      \\          /\\    /\\    /\\    /\\          /\r\n       \\        /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\        /\r\n        \\      /    \\/    \\/    \\/    \\      /\r\n         \\     \\    /\\    /\\    /\\    /     /\r\n          \\     \\  /  \\  /  \\  /  \\  /     /\r\n           \\     \\/    \\/    \\/    \\/     /\r\n            \\    /\\____/\\____/\\____/\\    /\r\n             \\  /                    \\  /\r\n              \\|                      |/\r\n                \\____________________/\r\n                                                                   pg176\r\nThis Diagram gives us 31 closed compartments.\r\n\r\nFor _six_ letters, Mr. Venn suggests that we might use _two_ Diagrams,\r\nlike the above, one for the f-part, and the other for the not-f-part, of\r\nall the other combinations. \"This\", he says, \"would give the desired 64\r\nsubdivisions.\" This, however, would only give 62 closed Compartments,\r\nand _one_ infinite area, which the two Classes, a'b'c'd'e'f and\r\na'b'c'd'e'f', would have to share between them.\r\n\r\nBeyond _six_ letters Mr. Venn does not go.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7.\r\n\r\n_My Method of Diagrams._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Method of Diagrams _resembles_ Mr. Venn's, in having separate\r\nCompartments assigned to the various Classes, and in marking these\r\nCompartments as _occupied_ or as _empty_; but it _differs_ from his\r\nMethod, in assigning a _closed_ area to the _Universe of Discourse_, so\r\nthat the Class which, under Mr. Venn's liberal sway, has been ranging at\r\nwill through Infinite Space, is suddenly dismayed to find itself\r\n\"cabin'd, cribb'd, confined\", in a limited Cell like any other Class!\r\nAlso I use _rectilinear_, instead of _curvilinear_, Figures; and I mark\r\nan _occupied_ Cell with a 'I' (meaning that there is at least _one_\r\nThing in it), and an _empty_ Cell with a 'O' (meaning that there is _no_\r\nThing in it).\r\n\r\nFor _two_ letters, I use this Diagram, in which the North Half is\r\nassigned to 'x', the South to 'not-x' (or 'x''), the West to y, and the\r\nEast to y'. Thus the N.W. Cell contains the xy-Class, the N.E. Cell the\r\nxy'-Class, and so on.\r\n\r\n    ·-------·\r\n    |   |   |\r\n    |---|---|\r\n    |   |   |\r\n    ·-------·\r\n\r\nFor _three_ letters, I subdivide these four Cells, by drawing an _Inner_\r\nSquare, which I assign to m, the _Outer_ Border being assigned to m'. I\r\nthus get _eight_ Cells that are needed to accommodate the eight Classes,\r\nwhose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xym, xym', &c.\r\n\r\n    ·---------------·\r\n    |       |       |\r\n    |   ·---|---·   |\r\n    |   |   |   |   |\r\n    |---|---|---|---|\r\n    |   |   |   |   |\r\n    |   ·---|---·   |\r\n    |       |       |\r\n    ·---------------·\r\n\r\nThis last Diagram is the most complex that I use in the _Elementary_\r\nPart of my 'Symbolic Logic.' But I may as well take this opportunity of\r\ndescribing the more complex ones which will appear in Part II.\r\n                                                                   pg177\r\nFor _four_ letters (which I call a, b, c, d) I use this Diagram;\r\nassigning the North Half to a (and of course the _rest_ of the Diagram\r\nto a'), the West Half to b, the Horizontal Oblong to c, and the Upright\r\nOblong to d. We have now got 16 Cells.\r\n\r\n    ·---------------------·\r\n    |          |          |\r\n    |      ·---|---·      |\r\n    |      |   |   |      |\r\n    |  ·---|---|---|---·  |\r\n    |  |   |   |   |   |  |\r\n    |--|---|---|---|---|--|\r\n    |  |   |   |   |   |  |\r\n    |  ·---|---|---|---·  |\r\n    |      |   |   |      |\r\n    |      ·---|---·      |\r\n    |          |          |\r\n    ·---------------------·\r\n\r\nFor _five_ letters (adding e) I subdivide the 16 Cells of the previous\r\nDiagram by _oblique_ partitions, assigning all the _upper_ portions to\r\ne, and all the _lower_ portions to e'. Here, I admit, we lose the\r\nadvantage of having the e-Class all _together_, \"in a ring-fence\", like\r\nthe other 4 Classes. Still, it is very easy to find; and the operation,\r\nof erasing it, is nearly as easy as that of erasing any other Class.

Let us take, as our example, No. 29\r\n(see p. 102).\r\n\r\n    \"No philosophers are conceited;\r\n     Some conceited persons are not gamblers.\r\n       .'.

Some not-gamblers are not philosophers\"\r\n\r\nThis can be proved by reduction to _Ferio_, thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"No conceited persons are philosophers;\r\n     Some not-gamblers are conceited.\r\n       .'.

While they have elaborately discussed no less than _nineteen_\r\ndifferent forms of _Syllogisms_----each with its own special and\r\nexasperating Rules, while the whole constitute an almost useless\r\nmachine, for practical purposes, many of the Conclusions being\r\nincomplete, and many quite legitimate forms being ignored----they have\r\nlimited _Sorites_ to _two_ forms only, of childish simplicity; and these\r\nthey have dignified with special _names_, apparently under the\r\nimpression that no other possible forms existed!\r\n\r\nAs to _Syllogisms_, I find that their nineteen forms, with about a score\r\nof others which they have ignored, can all be arranged under _three_\r\nforms, each with a very simple Rule of its own; and the only question\r\nthe Reader has to settle, in working any one of the 101 Examples given\r\nat p. 101 of this book, is \"Does it belong to Fig. I., II., or III.?\"\r\n                                                                   pg184\r\nAs to _Sorites_, the only two forms, recognised by the text-books, are\r\nthe _Aristotelian_, whose Premisses are a series of Propositions in A,\r\nso arranged that the Predicate of each is the Subject of the next, and\r\nthe _Goclenian_, whose Premisses are the very same series, written\r\nbackwards. Goclenius, it seems, was the first who noticed the startling\r\nfact that it does not affect the force of a Syllogism to invert the\r\norder of its Premisses, and who applied this discovery to a Sorites. If\r\nwe assume (as surely we may?) that he is the _same_ man as that\r\ntranscendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing\r\nas 5 times 4, we may apply to him what somebody (Edmund Yates, I think\r\nit was) has said of Tupper, viz., \"here is a man who, beyond all others\r\nof his generation, has been favoured with Glimpses of the Obvious!\"\r\n\r\nThese puerile----not to say infantine----forms of a Sorites I have, in\r\nthis book, ignored from the very first, and have not only admitted\r\nfreely Propositions in _E_, but have purposely stated the Premisses in\r\nrandom order, leaving to the Reader the useful task of arranging them,\r\nfor himself, in an order which can be worked as a series of regular\r\nSyllogisms. In doing this, he can begin with _any one_ of them he likes.\r\n\r\nI have tabulated, for curiosity, the various orders in which the\r\nPremisses of the Aristotelian Sorites\r\n\r\n    1. All a are b;\r\n    2. All b are c;\r\n    3. All c are d;\r\n    4. All d are e;\r\n    5. All e are h.\r\n       .'. All a are h.\r\n\r\nmay be syllogistically arranged, and I find there are no less than\r\n_sixteen_ such orders, viz., 12345, 21345, 23145, 23415, 23451, 32145,\r\n32415, 32451, 34215, 34251, 34521, 43215, 43251, 43521, 45321, 54321. Of\r\nthese the _first_ and the _last_ have been dignified with names; but the\r\nother _fourteen_----first enumerated by an obscure Writer on Logic,\r\ntowards the end of the Nineteenth Century----remain without a name!\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg185\r\n§ 10.\r\n\r\n_Some account of Parts II, III._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Part II. will be found some of the matters mentioned in this\r\nAppendix, viz., the \"Existential Import\" of Propositions, the use of a\r\n_negative_ Copula, and the theory that \"two negative Premisses prove\r\nnothing.\" I shall also extend the range of Syllogisms, by introducing\r\nPropositions containing alternatives (such as \"Not-all x are y\"),\r\nPropositions containing 3 or more Terms (such as \"All ab are c\", which,\r\ntaken along with \"Some bc' are d\", would prove \"Some d are a'\"), &c. I\r\nshall also discuss Sorites containing Entities, and the _very_ puzzling\r\nsubjects of Hypotheticals and Dilemmas. I hope, in the course of Part\r\nII., to go over all the ground usually traversed in the text-books used\r\nin our Schools and Universities, and to enable my Readers to solve\r\nProblems of the same kind as, and far harder than, those that are at\r\npresent set in their Examinations.\r\n\r\nIn Part III. I hope to deal with many curious and out-of-the-way\r\nsubjects, some of which are not even alluded to in any of the treatises\r\nI have met with. In this Part will be found such matters as the Analysis\r\nof Propositions into their Elements (let the Reader, who has never gone\r\ninto this branch of the subject, try to make out for himself what\r\n_additional_ Proposition would be needed to convert \"Some a are b\" into\r\n\"Some a are bc\"), the treatment of Numerical and Geometrical Problems,\r\nthe construction of Problems, and the solution of Syllogisms and Sorites\r\ncontaining Propositions more complex than any that I have used in Part\r\nII.\r\n\r\nI will conclude with eight Problems, as a taste of what is coming in\r\nPart II. I shall be very glad to receive, from any Reader, who thinks he\r\nhas solved any one of them (more especially if he has done so _without_\r\nusing any Method of Symbols), what he conceives to be its complete\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to explain what I mean by the _complete_ Conclusion of a\r\nSyllogism or a Sorites. I distinguish their Terms as being of two\r\nkinds----those which _can_ be eliminated (e.g. the Middle Term of a\r\nSyllogism), which I call the \"Eliminands,\" and those which _cannot_,\r\nwhich I call the \"Retinends\"; and I do not call the Conclusion\r\n_complete_, unless it states _all_ the relations among the Retinends\r\nonly, which can be deduced from the Premisses.\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg186\r\n1.\r\n\r\nAll the boys, in a certain School, sit together in one large room every\r\nevening. They are of no less than _five_ nationalities----English,\r\nScotch, Welsh, Irish, and German. One of the Monitors (who is a great\r\nreader of Wilkie Collins' novels) is very observant, and takes MS. notes\r\nof almost everything that happens, with the view of being a good\r\nsensational witness, in case any conspiracy to commit a murder should be\r\non foot.

Remembering how much amusement they had derived\r\nfrom their code of rules for walking-parties, they devised the following\r\nrules to be observed whenever beef appeared on the table:--\r\n\r\n(1) If Barry takes salt, then either Cole or Lang takes _one_ only of\r\nthe two condiments, salt and mustard: if he takes mustard, then either\r\nDix takes neither condiment, or Mill takes both.\r\n\r\n(2) If Cole takes salt, then either Barry takes only _one_ condiment, or\r\nMill takes neither: if he takes mustard, then either Dix or Lang takes\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n(3) If Dix takes salt, then either Barry takes neither condiment or Cole\r\ntake both: if he takes mustard, then either Lang or Mill takes neither.\r\n\r\n(4) If Lang takes salt, then Barry or Dix takes only _one_ condiment: if\r\nhe takes mustard, then either Cole or Mill takes neither.\r\n\r\n(5) If Mill takes salt, then either Barry or Lang takes both condiments:\r\nif he takes mustard, then either Cole or Dix takes only _one_.\r\n\r\nThe Problem is to discover whether these rules are _compatible_; and, if\r\nso, what arrangements are possible.\r\n\r\n    [N.B.

And so with all\r\n    similar phrases.\r\n\r\n    It is also assumed that the phrase \"either Cole or Lang takes\r\n    _one_ only of the two condiments\" allows _three_ possible cases,\r\n    viz.

Hence it may appear to him that the\r\nargument might have been put as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"We now have I and A 'asserting.' Hence, if the Proposition 'All xy are\r\nz' be true, some things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e. 'Some x\r\nare y.'\r\n\r\n\"Also we know that, if the Proposition 'Some xy are not-z' be true the\r\nsame result follows.\r\n\r\n\"But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of\r\nthem _must_ be true. Hence this result is always true: i.e. the\r\nProposition 'Some x are y' is _always_ true!\r\n\r\n\"_Quod est absurdum._ Hence I _cannot_ assert.\"\r\n\r\nThis matter will be discussed in Part II; but I may as well give here\r\nwhat seems to me to be an irresistable proof that this view (that _A_\r\nand _I_ are Contradictories), though adopted in the ordinary text-books,\r\nis untenable. The proof is as follows:--\r\n\r\nWith regard to the relationship existing between the Class 'xy' and the\r\ntwo Classes 'z' and 'not-z', there are _four_ conceivable states of\r\nthings, viz.\r\n\r\n    (1) Some xy are z, and some are not-z;\r\n    (2)    \"      \"        none     \"\r\n    (3) No xy     \"        some     \"\r\n    (4)    \"      \"        none     \"\r\n\r\nOf these four, No. (2) is equivalent to \"All xy are z\", No. (3) is\r\nequivalent to \"All xy are not-z\", and No. (4) is equivalent to \"No xy\r\nexist.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is quite undeniable that, of these _four_ states of things, each\r\nis, _a priori_, _possible_, some _one must_ be true, and the other three\r\n_must_ be false.\r\n\r\nHence the Contradictory to (2) is \"Either (1) or (3) or (4) is true.\"\r\nNow the assertion \"Either (1) or (3) is true\" is equivalent to \"Some xy\r\nare not-z\"; and the assertion \"(4) is true\" is equivalent to \"No xy\r\nexist.\" Hence the Contradictory to \"All xy are z\" may be expressed as\r\nthe Alternative Proposition \"Either some xy are not-z, or no xy exist,\"\r\nbut _not_ as the Categorical Proposition \"Some y are not-z.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg196\r\n(B) [See p. 171, at end of Section 2.]\r\n\r\nThere are yet _other_ views current among \"The Logicians\", as to the\r\n\"Existential Import\" of Propositions, which have not been mentioned in\r\nthis Section.\r\n\r\nOne is, that the Proposition \"some x are y\" is to be interpreted,\r\nneither as \"Some x _exist_ and are y\", nor yet as \"If there _were_ any x\r\nin existence, some of them _would_ be y\", but merely as \"Some x _can be_\r\ny; i.e. the Attributes x and y are _compatible_\". On _this_ theory,\r\nthere would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend Jones \"Some of\r\nyour brothers are swindlers\"; since, if he indignantly retorted \"What do\r\nyou _mean_ by such insulting language, you scoundrel?\", I should calmly\r\nreply \"I merely mean that the thing is _conceivable_----that some of\r\nyour brothers _might possibly_ be swindlers\". But it may well be doubted\r\nwhether such an explanation would _entirely_ appease the wrath of Jones!\r\n\r\nAnother view is, that the Proposition \"All x are y\" _sometimes_ implies\r\nthe actual _existence_ of x, and _sometimes_ does _not_ imply it; and\r\nthat we cannot tell, without having it in _concrete_ form, _which_\r\ninterpretation we are to give to it. _This_ view is, I think, strongly\r\nsupported by common usage; and it will be fully discussed in Part II:\r\nbut the difficulties, which it introduces, seem to me too formidable to\r\nbe even alluded to in Part I, which I am trying to make, as far as\r\npossible, easily intelligible to mere _beginners_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(C) [See p. 173, § 4.]\r\n\r\nThe three Conclusions are\r\n\r\n    \"No conceited child of mine is greedy\";\r\n    \"None of my boys could solve this problem\";\r\n    \"Some unlearned boys are not choristers.\"\r\n\r\n                                                                   pg197\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1.\r\n\r\n_Tables._\r\n\r\n   I.

To assist the reader,\r\npage markers in the forms \"pg-ix\", \"pg193\" & \"px-3\" have been included\r\nin the right margin at points corresponding closely to the tops of the\r\noriginal pages. These may be searched for to locate the material\r\nreferred to. In the main section, these page markers are always given\r\nwith 3 digits including, if necessary, leading zeroes.\r\n\r\nThis book contains a large number of line drawn illustrations which are\r\nun-credited. As these cannot be rendered here in the original manner\r\nthey have been reproduced as well as possible in the manner known as\r\n\"ASCII art\".\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of transcription errors were found in the original book. As\r\nthese were clearly not part of the Author's intention they have, as far\r\nas possible, been identified and corrected in accordance with the\r\nmethods given by the Author. These corrections are listed here below\r\nwith their locations and original text. In these notes the word\r\n'natural' identifies a letter symbol occurring without a prime mark.\r\n\r\nPage viii: \"189\" corrected to \"194\".\r\nPage viii: \"188\" corrected to \"192\".\r\nPage xv, '=Real=' and '=Unreal=', or '=Imaginary=', Classes: \"1½\"\r\n          corrected to \"2\".\r\nPage xix, Propositions beginning with \"Some\": \"18\" corrected to \"19\".\r\nPage xix, Rules: \"19\" corrected to \"20\".\r\nPage xix, The West and East Halves ...: \"24\" corrected to \"23\".\r\nPage xxi, The Proposition \"All x are y\" ...: was originally shown as\r\n          occurring in page 34.\r\nPage xxii, And of three other similar arrangements: \"37\" corrected to\r\n          \"36\".\r\nPage xxiii, The Proposition 'No xm exist': \"43\" corrected to \"44\".\r\nPage 060: \"contruct\" corrected to \"construct\".\r\nPage 094, Paper V: missing word \"it\" supplied.\r\nPage 111, #28: \"No h are k-natural\" corrected to \"No h are k-prime\".\r\nPage 111, #30: \"No a are h-natural\" corrected to \"No a are h-prime\".\r\nPage 111, #30: \"No c are n-natural\" corrected to \"No c are n-prime\".\r\nPage 123, #57 (d): \"mortally offended if I fail to notice them\"\r\n          corrected to \"mortally offended\".\r\nPage 128, #34: \"Some x-prime are y\" corrected to \"Some x-natural are y\".\r\nPage 146, #30: \"x_{1}m-prime_{0}\" corrected to \"x_{1}m-natural_{0}\".\r\nPage 147, #32: \"xm-natural_{0}\" corrected to \"xm-prime_{0}\".\r\nPage 156, #18 (4/1): \"be\" corrected to \"be-sub:zero\".\r\nPage 156, #22 (5/1): \"ch\" corrected to \"ch-sub:zero\".\r\nPage 157, #23 (5/2): second underline corrected from single to double.\r\nPage 157, #23 (2/2): first underline corrected from single to double.\r\nPage 157, #23 (¶2): \"h_{1}c\" corrected to \"h_{1}c-sub:zero\".\r\nPage 157, #26 (5/1): \"a_{1}c-natural_{0}\" corrected to\r\n          \"a_{1}c-prime_{0}\".\r\nPage 157, #26 (¶2): \"e_{1}c-natural_{0}\" corrected to\r\n          \"e_{1}c-prime_{0}\".\r\nPage 157, #29 (8/2): first underline corrected from single to double.\r\nPage 161, #36 (4/2): \"e'd-prime\" corrected to \"e'd-natural\".\r\nPage 161, #39 (1/2): \"c-prime+d\" corrected to \"c-natural+d\".\r\nPage 161, #40: \"a\" and \"b\" interchanged.\r\nPage 161, #43 (1/1): \"b-natural_{1}e_{0}\" corrected to\r\n          \"b-prime_{1}e_{0}\".\r\nPage 162, #52 (3/1): \"h'k-prime_{0}\" corrected to \"h'k-natural_{0}\".\r\nPage 163, #55 (3/2): \"c'd-prime\" corrected to \"c'd-natural\".\r\nPage 163, #57 (1/2): \"h-natural+d'\" corrected to \"h-prime+d'\".\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the original book at the top of page 97, the following text occurred:\r\n\r\n    [N.B. The numbers at the foot of each page indicate the pages\r\n    where the corresponding matter may be found.]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the un-paged medium here this has been changed to:\r\n\r\n    [N.B. Reference tags for Examples, Answers & Solutions will be\r\n    found in the right margin.]\r\n\r\nThe part of the book to which this relates contains, by sections,\r\n\"Examples\" (Exercises for the student), \"Answers\" (to the Examples) &\r\n\"Solutions\" (Worked Answers). All Example sections have corresponding\r\nAnswer sections. For Sections 2 & 3, worked Solutions are not supplied;\r\nfor Sections 4-7, Solutions are given by 2 different methods. In\r\nassociation with this, the original text contained editorial notes at\r\nthe foot of each page giving the page numbers for the related Sections.\r\nIn this version, these notes are replaced with marginal tags such as\r\nEX3, AN4, SL5, & SL6-A and SL7-B which are placed at the top of each\r\nSection to identify the current location. As with page tags, these may\r\nbe searched for to locate the material refered to. (A search for \"SL4\"\r\nshould find successively both \"SL4-A\" & \"SL4-B\".) These tags are unique\r\nregardless of case.",
