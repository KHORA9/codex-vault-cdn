How\r\n    he followed Cœur de Lion to the Orient. His brilliant exploits on\r\n    the battle-field, under the walls of Joppa. His marriage in the\r\n    presence of Saladin and Cœur de Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWORD STIRRUPS OF MY ANCESTOR, THE FAMOUS ARMLESS\r\nKNIGHT.]\r\n\r\nI come from one of the most ancient and honorable families of North\r\nGermany—famous for its valor and love of adventure.\r\n\r\nOne of my ancestors, when just entering the twenties heard at his\r\nfather’s table one morning, that England’s great King Cœur de Lion was\r\nabout to lead an army against the infidels.\r\n\r\n“Gracious parent,” cried the young man starting up from his seat, his\r\neyes on fire, his cheeks ablaze, “May I join the Crusaders and aid in\r\nthe destruction of the enemies of our holy religion?” “Alas, poor boy!”\r\nreplied his father, casting a pitying glance at the youth, who, through\r\nsome strange freak of nature had been born armless, “thou wert not\r\nintended for terrible conflicts such as await our cousin Cœur de Lion.\r\nThou lackest every means of wielding the battle sword, of couching the\r\nlance. ’Twould be murder to set thy defenceless body before the uplifted\r\ncimeter of the merciless Moslem! My dear son, banish such thoughts from\r\nthy mind and turn thee to poesy and philosophy, thou shalt add new\r\nlustre to our family name by thy learning.” “Nay gracious parent, hear\r\nme!” urged the youth with eloquent eye: “true, nature has denied me\r\narms, but she has not been so cruel as might be supposed for, as\r\ncompensation, she has given a giant’s strength to my lower limbs. Dost\r\nnot remember how last month, I slew a wild boar with one blow from the\r\nheel of my hunting-boot?” “I do,” answered the grim old Baron with a\r\nsmile, “but—” “Pardon my interruption noble father” came from the young\r\nman, “I shall go into battle doubly armed, for to each stirrup shall I\r\naffix a sword and woe betide the Mussulman who dares meet me on the\r\nbattle-field.”\r\n\r\n“Go then my son!” cried the old Baron as the tears trickled down his\r\nbattle-scarred cheeks, “go, join our royal cousin Cœur de Lion and if\r\nthou, armless, canst withstand the fury of the infidel, another glory\r\nwill be added to the name of Trump, and in this ancestral hall shall\r\nhang a portrait of the ‘Armless Knight,’ upon which for all time the\r\nlovers of valiant deeds shall rest their wondering eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe joy of my young ancestor knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nScarcely staying to make needful preparations for his journey, with a\r\nhandful of trusty retainers, he rode from the castle yard amid the\r\nplaudits of thousands of fair women who had gathered from the\r\nneighboring city to wish God speed to the “Armless Knight.”\r\n\r\n’Twas not until the famous battle under the walls of Joppa that my\r\nancestor had an opportunity to give an exhibition of his bravery, his\r\nextraordinary strength, and the resistless fury of his onslaughts.\r\n\r\nNot one, not five, not ten common soldiers dared face the “Armless\r\nKnight.”\r\n\r\nWhole squadrons recoiled in terror before this mysterious avenger of the\r\nwrongs of Christendom, who, without hands, struck down the Moslem\r\nwarriors, as the grain falls before the blast.\r\n\r\nAgain and again, Saladin sent the flower of his men against the “Armless\r\nKnight,” whose strength and valor had already made his name a terror to\r\nthe superstitious soldiery. Little realizing the terrible fate awaiting\r\nhim, the Moslem warrior would rush upon my ancestor with uplifted\r\ncimeter, when with one blow of his sword-armed stirrup the “Armless\r\nKnight” would cleave the breast of his foeman’s horse, and then trample\r\nthe infidel to death as he rolled upon the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was now high noon.\r\n\r\nUpon an eminence, Saladin, watching the tide of battle, saw with anxious\r\neye the appalling slaughter of the very flower of his army.\r\n\r\nAlready the name, rank, and nationality of my young ancestor had been\r\nmade known to the Moslem leader.\r\n\r\n“La, il la! Mahomed ul Becullah!” he cried, stroking his beard. “Blessed\r\nis the man who can call that Christian warrior his son! How many of the\r\nProphet’s children has he slain this day?”\r\n\r\n“Six hundred and fifty-nine!” was the answer given.\r\n\r\n“Six hundred and fifty-nine,” echoed Saladin, “and it is but noonday!”\r\nWhen nightfall came the number had been increased to one thousand and\r\nseven.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing of the terrible day’s work of the “Armless Knight,”\r\nSaladin’s great heart bled, and yet he could not withhold his admiration\r\nfor such wondrous skill and bravery.\r\n\r\n“Go!” cried the magnanimous infidel Chieftain, “go, take from my\r\nhousehold that beauteous slave Kohilât, her with orbs of lustrous black,\r\nthe very blossom of grace and flower of queenly beauty. Lead her to the\r\n“Armless Knight,” with royal greeting from Saladin; his valor makes him\r\nmy brother, Giaour though he be! Away!”\r\n\r\nWhen the beautiful Kohilât was led into the presence of my young\r\nancestor, and the announcement made to him that Saladin had sent her as\r\na present to him, the “Armless Knight,” with royal greeting as a token\r\nof his respect for one so young, and yet so valiant, the first thought\r\nof the Christian youth was to wave her indignantly from his presence.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, however, Kohilât raised her large and lustrous eyes, and\r\nfixed them full upon the young man’s face.\r\n\r\nIt was more than human heart could stand.\r\n\r\nMotioning her retinue to leave his tent, he advanced to her side, with\r\nrespectful mien, and said:\r\n\r\n“Kohilât, a strange fate has sent thee to me. The messenger of the great\r\nSaladin imparts to me knowledge of thy goodness, thy amiability, and thy\r\ngifted mind, which holds within its store most delightful imagery and\r\nuseful knowledge as well. He informs me that thou standest in the direct\r\nline of descent from that famed princess of your land, Scheherezada, who\r\nfor a thousand and one nights held the thoughts of the Sultan of the\r\nIndies so enthralled by the play of her brilliant fancy, as to turn him\r\naside from his terrible project of vengeance. Dost think, Kohilât, that\r\nthou canst forget thy false god and love only the true one?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, my lord,” murmured the gentle Kohilât, “if such be my lord’s\r\npleasure.”\r\n\r\nA smile spread over the handsome face of my young ancestor. He would\r\nfain have met with more resistance in converting the fair infidel to the\r\ntrue faith, but though he searched that beautiful face long and closely\r\nfor any sign of subtility, yet saw he none.\r\n\r\n“’Tis well, Kohilât,” he continued, “and now answer me, and speak from\r\nthy heart. Art thou willing to become my wife, according to the rites of\r\nthe Christian church and the laws of my native land?”\r\n\r\nAgain the beautiful Kohilât replied:\r\n\r\n“Ay, my lord; if such be thy pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThe following day a truce was proclaimed, and in the presence of the two\r\ngreat leaders of the opposing armies, Cœur de Lion and Saladin, both\r\nsurrounded by the most glorious retinue, my young ancestor and the\r\nprincess Kohilât were joined together as man and wife by the royal\r\nconfessor, the “Armless Knight” towering above the surrounding multitude\r\nin his glittering coat of mail like a column of burnished silver. When\r\nhe advanced to meet his dark-eyed bride, with the marriage ring held\r\nbetween his lips, a mighty shout went up from both armies.\r\n\r\nSaladin stroked his beard. Cœur de Lion made the sign of the cross. In a\r\nshort half hour the leaders had returned to their camps, and war had\r\nresumed its awful work of destruction.\r\n\r\nTo this union of my renowned ancestor, the “Armless Knight,” with the\r\nMoslem maid, I attribute my possession of an almost Oriental exuberance\r\nof fancy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF MY FAMOUS ANCESTOR, THE “ARMLESS KNIGHT,”\r\nWITH HIS MARRIAGE RING BETWEEN HIS LIPS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  The elder Baron uncertain as to the exact locality of my birth.\r\n    Reasons why will be given later. My parents traveling in Africa at\r\n    this time. The elder Baron’s remarkable ascent of the Mountains of\r\n    the Moon. Miraculous escape from the impenetrable fog. How\r\n    accomplished. In the land of the Melodious Sneezers. All that\r\n    happened there. How the King of the Melodious Sneezers conducted my\r\n    parents in great honor to his palace, and how they were treated by\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MUZZLED MULES]\r\n\r\nWhile it lies within my power to gratify the curiosity of my readers as\r\nto what part of the world it was in which I first saw darkness—for I was\r\nborn in the night—yet, as to the nature of the immediate spot on which I\r\nwas born, unfortunately I am able to do more than repeat my father’s\r\nwords when questioned as to this point.\r\n\r\n“My son, if I were on my death-bed I could only say that thou wert\r\neither born in the centre in a great lake, on an island, upon a\r\npeninsula or on the top of a very high mountain, as I have often\r\nexplained to thee.”\r\n\r\nLet it suffice, then, gentle reader, for the present, for me to inform\r\nyou that at the time of my birth, my parents were traveling in Africa;\r\nthat my father had just successfully accomplished one of the most\r\nwonderful feats in mountain climbing, namely, the ascent of the loftiest\r\npeak of the Mountains of the Moon; that his guides had abandoned him\r\nupon his reaching a particularly dangerous spot in the ascent; but that\r\nhe had pushed forward without them, and reached the summit after several\r\ndays of terrible privation, suffering both hunger and thirst,—it being a\r\npeculiarity of the atmosphere after passing a certain height that the\r\nmuscles of the face and throat became paralyzed and the unfortunate\r\ntraveler either perishes from hunger or thirst while in the very\r\npresence of delicious fruit and cool, limpid water.\r\n\r\nUpon rejoining my mother, who had accompanied him as far up the mountain\r\nside as the best-trained and most surefooted mules could find a\r\nfoot-hold, they proceeded to make their way, as they supposed, to the\r\nvalley from which they had first set out.\r\n\r\nAn impenetrable fog now shut them in and they soon found themselves\r\nhopelessly and helplessly wandering about.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third day the fog had even increased in thickness,\r\nclosing around them like a pall, almost shutting out the light of day.\r\n\r\nWhile groping about my father had come into contact with the two beasts\r\nof burden which had served him in the easier parts of the ascent. They\r\nwere quietly and unconcernedly browsing upon the sweet and tender shrubs\r\nwhich grew on the mountain side.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an idea came to my father. It was born of that desperation\r\nwhich makes a man think long and hard before lying down to die.\r\n\r\nIt was thus he reasoned: If these animals are permitted to eat their\r\nfill whenever their appetites demand, they will be quite willing to stay\r\nwhere they are, especially when they find themselves surrounded by such\r\nexcellent pastures, and, in addition thereto, quite relieved from all\r\ntoil. Let them, however, feel the pangs of hunger, or better yet,\r\nstarvation’s tooth at their vitals and their thoughts will at once\r\nrevert to their homes, their masters, their feeding-troughs and they\r\nwill lose no time in setting out for the village where they belong. With\r\nthe energy of despair, my father hurriedly bound a piece of canvass over\r\ntheir mouths so that they could neither graze nor drink and awaited the\r\nresults of his experiment, with bated breath, for the tears and groans\r\nof my poor mother, whose strength was fast ebbing away, smote him to the\r\nvery soul.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours the animals rose to their feet and became very\r\nrestive, and in another hour their hunger had so increased that they\r\nwere making frantic efforts to feed, as my father could easily tell from\r\nthe jerking of the line which he had been careful to attach to their\r\nheadstalls.\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth hour there was a long silence, during which the animals\r\nseemed to be deliberating as to what course they should pursue.\r\n\r\nThe fifth hour came.\r\n\r\nMy mother had sunk to rest, weak and weary, in my father’s arms.\r\nSuddenly there was a tightening of the guiding lines. Gently my father\r\naroused his sleeping mate, whispering a few words of comfort.\r\n\r\nAgain the lines tightened.\r\n\r\nMy parents were now on their feet, peering into the depths of the\r\nimpenetrable fog which shrouded them about and made them even invisible\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\nHist! the animals move again! with a sudden impulse, as if their minds\r\nhad at last solved the problem which had been bewildering them for\r\nseveral hours, the beasts, with violent snortings turned from the spot,\r\npushing through the shrubbery and causing my parents to face quite\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nEvidently there was a complete accord between the conclusions reached by\r\ntheir intelligence or instinct, for not once did they pull apart or come\r\nto a halt, except when restrained by my father. And thus my dear parents\r\nwere saved! All that day and part of the next did they pursue their\r\ndreary way. The fog at last lifted, and it was at once apparent to my\r\nfather that, although the animals were guiding them towards human\r\nhabitations, yet it was not the land he had quitted upon starting out\r\nupon the journey to the mountain peak. The path now became so plainly\r\nvisible that my father removed the improvised muzzles from the two\r\nanimals and allowed them to satisfy their hunger, which they proceeded\r\nto do with the keenest relish. So worn out was my mother that she sank\r\nhelpless to the ground. Refreshing her with a draught of spring-water\r\nand the juice of some wild grapes, my father hastily prepared a bed of\r\nsoft foliage, upon which they were both glad to throw themselves after\r\ntheir long and weary tramp.\r\n\r\nThey had soon fallen into a deep and most delightful sleep. How long\r\nthey lay on their leafy bed, wrapt in their refreshing slumber, they\r\nknew not.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was for many a long hour; for when they awoke, hunger was\r\ngnawing at their stomachs. Fain would they have at once proceeded to\r\ngather fruit, had not their ears been suddenly saluted with most\r\nextraordinary noises. They rubbed their eyes and looked about and at\r\neach other, deeming themselves the sport of some merry jack-a-dreamer.\r\n\r\nBut, no; they were wide awake and in full possession of their senses.\r\nAgain the strange sounds are heard and this time they are nearer and\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\nThere is a rise and a fall, a swelling out and then a dying away.\r\n\r\nThe sounds are jerky and snappy like and there is a singular music in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNearer and still nearer they come. Louder and still louder they grow.\r\n“Wild beasts?” whispered my mother half inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Nay!” falls from my father’s lips. “Not unless human beings may be so\r\nwild as to merit the name of beasts.”\r\n\r\n“Hark again!” murmured my mother.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the sounds any longer, for, like a chorus of many\r\nvoices, shrill and piping, deep and grumbling, soft and musical, harsh\r\nand guttural, yet all in a sort of rude and wild harmony, mingling in\r\none mighty strain, now low and scarcely audible and now breaking out\r\nwith a fierce and seemingly threatening vigor, the singers, chanters,\r\nhowlers or what they might be, rushed into the valley below us in a wild\r\nand yet half regulated disorder.\r\n\r\nThey were human beings in savage garb, with painted faces and clubs\r\nswung lightly across their shoulders. Whether pausing or advancing they\r\nstill kept up their wild and mysterious chant, choppy, jerky and snappy\r\nfor all the world like a thousand people who had just drawn plentifully\r\nfrom a thousand snuff boxes.\r\n\r\n“Save me, husband!” cried my mother with pallid face. “We shall be put\r\nto some awful torture by these wild children of the forest.” A smile so\r\ngentle, and yet so calm, that it could not fail to be reassuring spread\r\nover my father’s features.\r\n\r\n“Never fear!” said he, “I know them, I’ve been seeking them! What has\r\nbeen denied many a traveler stronger and bolder than I, has been\r\naccorded to a member of the Trump family in the most miraculous manner.\r\nWhen we return to Europe every Monarch, every learned society, will\r\nhasten to bind a medal on my breast, for, dear wife, your husband is the\r\nfirst white man to enter the land of the—”\r\n\r\n“The—?” echoed my mother leaning forward and grasping her husband’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Melodious Sneezers!”\r\n\r\n“Melodious Sneezers?” repeated my mother with wide-opened eye, and\r\namusement seated in every feature.\r\n\r\n“Melo—”\r\n\r\nBut she could get no further. To my father’s infinite amusement, she\r\nfell a-sneezing most violently. In such rapid succession did the sneezes\r\nflow that it sounded exactly like a diminutive engine under full\r\nheadway.\r\n\r\nAt last the fit seemed to have passed. “Melo—” but in vain; she could\r\nnot reach the second syllable.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in his turn, my father started off, slow at first but going\r\nfaster and faster.\r\n\r\nStrange to say their sneezing soon began to catch the ways of the\r\ncountry and blended thoroughly, keeping time in spite of their efforts\r\nto check it.\r\n\r\n“Know then, dear wife,” cried my father pantingly when his fit was over,\r\n“that those strange people stretched on the greensward below are the\r\n“Melodious Sneezers;” that they are not only perfectly harmless, but\r\ngentle, kind and peaceable to an astonishing degree. Fear them not!\r\nTheir clubs are only for game.” “But why—?” asked my mother warily lest\r\nanother fit should take her.\r\n\r\n“I understand thee,” was the reply. “Listen. Know, that in this valley\r\nand in the greater ones below, the air is always filled with myriads\r\nupon myriads of insects of infinitesimal size; only the strongest\r\nmicroscope can give proof to your sight of their actual existence. For\r\ncountless generations, these peaceable barbarians here have been\r\nsubjected to the tickling sensations which you and I have—”\r\n\r\nAgain my poor parent fell a-sneezing in regular and musical cadences, up\r\nand down, deep and shrill, now fast and faster, now slow and slower\r\nuntil silence reigned again.\r\n\r\n“Just experienced,” resumed my father, “until it has rendered the effort\r\nof sneezing quite as easy as breathing, and taking advantage of results\r\nwhich they soon discerned could not be avoided, these children of nature\r\nwere not slow to lay aside their usual speech and literally talk by\r\nsneezes!”\r\n\r\n“With them, a sneeze is capable of so many intonations, so many\r\ninflections, that they find no difficulty in expressing all the\r\nnecessary feelings and sensations,—at least necessary for them in their\r\nsimple lives, as you shall see later on.”\r\n\r\nFain would my poor mother here express her passing wonder but she dare\r\nnot open her mouth. “Come, dearest mate,” cried my father gayly.\r\n“Courage! Let us descend into this beautiful valley, for as yet we are\r\nonly standing upon the borders of the “Land of the Melodious Sneezers”\r\ncalled in their soft and musical tongue Lâ-aah-chew-lâ.”\r\n\r\nThe pronunciation of this word again threw my poor parents into a\r\nperfect whirlwind of sneezes; but nothing daunted, they advanced to meet\r\nthe natives, who at first sight fell prostrate on their faces and for\r\nseveral moments kept up a low plaintive hum of sneezes, with their noses\r\nthrust into the grass.\r\n\r\nBy degrees however, my father succeeding in convincing them that he was\r\nquite as peaceably inclined as they were.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Melodious Sneezers performed a most singular and withal\r\npleasing dance of joy, their feet keeping perfect time with their chorus\r\nof sneezing.\r\n\r\nAs my father afterwards learned, the dance was to express their intense\r\ngratitude to the “white spirits” for not having eaten them alive.\r\n\r\nThe march homeward was now entered upon, my father walking hand in hand\r\nwith the King Chew-chew-lô, and my mother escorted by a score or more of\r\nhis wives, the favorite of the royal house being named Chew-lâ-â-â-â-â\r\nand each successive one according as she occupied a less lofty place in\r\nthe King’s affections having a shorter name until at last Chew-lâ\r\nsignified little better than a mere serving maid.\r\n\r\nMy father found that the villages of the Melodious Sneezers, on account\r\nof the frequency and the violence of inundations from the network of\r\nrivers which completely shut in their land, consisted of houses or\r\nhabitations built in the trees or upon lofty piles.\r\n\r\nHe and my mother were lodged in one of the most commodious of the royal\r\ndwellings and so many slaves and attendants were assigned to care for\r\ntheir wants that there was little or no room to move about.\r\n\r\nTo their great sorrow, my father proceeded to dismiss several hundred in\r\norder that he might get close enough to my mother to converse without\r\nholloaing and then sent word to King Chew-chew-lô that both he and my\r\nmother would need at least a week of perfect rest and quiet to regain\r\ntheir health and strength after their terrible sufferings on the slopes\r\nof the Mountains of the Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  My birth.

Possibly I should say interesting to me; for,\r\ngentle reader, one of these “certain events” above referred to is a no\r\nless important occurrence than my birth into this grand and beautiful\r\nworld—a world which has proven to be full of wonderful things and of\r\nmore wonderful beings, as you shall see as I go on with my story.\r\n\r\nI was born in midsummer. It was the night season.\r\n\r\nTen thousand stars twinkled over the cradle of that wretched, little,\r\nhelpless, lump of clay; but brighter than all, like a crimson torch\r\nflaming in the skies, Sirius, the dog star, shone down upon me!\r\n\r\nMy father looked up at the heavens and smiling, murmured: “Little\r\nstranger, thou shalt ever be a lover of dogs. Thy smile shall be joy to\r\nthem, thy words music and in some four-footed beast of their race shalt\r\nthou find thy best, thy faithfulest, thy truest friend.”\r\n\r\nAs if to set the very stamp of truth upon my father’s words at that very\r\ninstant a cry of a mother dog was heard in an adjoining room and one of\r\nthe Royal household Chew-lâ-â came running into my presence with a\r\nbasket of tiny puppies. My father laughingly seized the wicker cradle of\r\nthis newly arrived family and holding it up to me, cried out:\r\n\r\n“Choose, little baron, choose thee a friend and companion.” I put out my\r\ntiny baby hand and it rested upon one with a particularly large head.\r\n“Ha! ha!” laughed my father, “thou hast well chosen, little baron, for\r\nhim thou hast chosen hath so much brain that his head doth fairly bulge\r\nwith it.”\r\n\r\nAnd when my infant tongue came to wrestle with that word, it was twisted\r\ninto “Bulger.” And thus it was that Bulger and I started out on life’s\r\njourney at almost the same moment! Upon the following day my father made\r\ndiscovery that the waters had begun to recede in the night, and as he\r\nlooked down from our lofty dwelling, he saw that it now stood apparently\r\nin the centre of quite an extensive island. After breakfast, in\r\naccordance with the custom of the country, my father put on a pair of\r\nKing Chew-chew-lô’s wooden shoes which were worn by all of the Melodious\r\nSneezers when attempting to move about on the surface of the soft mud\r\noccasioned by the inundation.\r\n\r\nThese wooden shoes are extremely light although quite as long and as\r\nbroad as snow shoes. The soles being polished, the wearer is enabled to\r\nglide over the mud which, from the nature of the soil is very oily, with\r\nthe same rapidity as a runner upon snow shoes.\r\n\r\nAfter an excursion of several hours up hill and down dale my father\r\nreturned with this piece of strange intelligence, namely, that their\r\nhabitation had undoubtedly, prior to the falling of the waters been\r\nsituated in a lake; but that by degrees, as the waters had receded, an\r\nisland had been formed, which somewhat later had been transformed into a\r\npeninsula, which in its turn by a still further sinking of the waters,\r\nhad been changed into the crown of a mountain with gently sloping sides\r\nso that, as he reported to my mother, to his dying day it would be\r\nimpossible for him to say whether his son had been born in a lake, on an\r\nisland, upon a peninsula or on a mountain top, a fact which pained him\r\nextremely, for, like all the members of his family, he took the greatest\r\npride in recording important events with scrupulous exactitude, even to\r\nthe smallest detail.\r\n\r\nUnlike most babes, who seem content to pass the first half year or so of\r\ntheir lives eating, sleeping and crying, I from the very outset\r\ndisplayed a most astonishing precocity.\r\n\r\nWhen only a few weeks old, although I could not talk, yet I had learned\r\nto whistle for Bulger, whose development in mind and body seemed to keep\r\neven pace with mine and who passed most of his time looking up into my\r\nchildish face with an expression which meant only too plainly:\r\n\r\n“Oh, I shall be so glad when that little tongue is unloosed so that you\r\nmay call me Bulger and bid me do your will.”\r\n\r\nNor had he long to wait.\r\n\r\nThe one thing, which, at this early period of my life gave me most joy,\r\nwas the sunlight.\r\n\r\nWithin doors, I was fretful, peevish, irritable, but once out in the\r\nopen air, my whole nature changed. I drank in the soft, balmy atmosphere\r\nwith a vigor and a satisfaction that delighted my father. My face\r\nbrightened, my eyes traveled from valley to hill, from mountain-top to\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nInto such an ecstacy of pleasure did this sight of the great world throw\r\nme, that my mother became anxious lest it presaged some great evil that\r\nwas to happen unto me.\r\n\r\nBut the stately Baron only smiled. “Fear nothing, wife, it only means\r\nthat within that little head dwells a most wonderfully active mind for a\r\nchild of its months.”\r\n\r\nWhenever Bulger heard his little master crying out in joyful tones at\r\nsight of the beautiful world, he was sure to be seized with a fit of\r\nviolent barking, during which he sprang around about me with the wildest\r\nand most extravagant manifestations of sympathy.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, there was a wonderful bond of affection between us.\r\n\r\nTo my mother’s-I had almost said horror, I, one day while she was\r\nwalking with me in her arms, upon the broad veranda, which encircled\r\nChewchewlô’s palaces, attempted to throw myself from her arms, crying\r\nout in German: Los! Los! (Let me go! Let me go!) I was but two months\r\nold and the loud and vigorous tone in which I pronounced this first word\r\nwhich I had spoken in my mother’s tongue fairly startled her.\r\n\r\nI had, up to that time, apparently been more interested in the soft and\r\nmusical language of my royal nurse, Chewlâ, in which I could make myself\r\nunderstood very easily. About this time an accident happened to me\r\nwhich, although it did not bring about, it greatly hastened the release\r\nfrom parently restraint, so ardently desired, both by Bulger and by me,\r\nfor from my very entrance into this world something told me that I\r\nshould be a famous child, not a mere, precocious youth who is made use\r\nof by his parents at social gatherings to bore people already in poor\r\nspirits, by mounting upon chair or table and declaiming verses,\r\nparrotlike, with half a dozen woodeny, jerky gestures; but a genuine\r\nhero, a real traveler, not afraid to brave a tempest, face a wild beast\r\nor bully a barbarous people into doing as he wanted them to do.\r\n\r\nIt was my mother’s custom in the cool of the day to sit with me on the\r\nbroad veranda while she darned my father’s stockings; for, although of\r\ngentle birth, she had been so accustomed when a girl to exercise German\r\nthrift in all things that now, even though she had become the wife of a\r\nreal baron, she could not forego the pleasure of doing things in those\r\ngood old ways.\r\n\r\nAnd thus she saved my father many a pfennig which the good man bestowed\r\nupon the worthy poor and went down to the grave loaded with their\r\nblessings.\r\n\r\nAt such a time it was that a sudden fit of sneezing seized my mother and\r\nto her unspeakable horror she let me slip from her arms. Down, down I\r\nfell, striking in the soft mud and disappearing from sight.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman dropped to the floor like lead.\r\n\r\nThe stately baron rose to his feet and the color fled from his manly\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nBut Chew-chew-lô, who fortunately was paying a visit to my father, only\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n“Unfeeling barbarian!” roared the great baron, “hast no respect for a\r\nfather’s tears, a mother’s anguish? Out upon thee! Would to heaven I had\r\nnever entered thy domain!” Chew-chew-lô spake not a word. Turning with\r\nimperious mien and right royal manner towards a crowd of retainers, he\r\nwaved his hand.\r\n\r\nQuicker than thought the band of Melodious Sneezers sprang to their\r\nwooden shoes.\r\n\r\nAway, away, they darted like black bats on the wing.\r\n\r\nThe baron saw that in his terrible grief he had let his better judgment\r\nslip away, and with pallid face and bended head stood supporting the\r\nfainting form of his wife.\r\n\r\nHe felt, he knew, that his presence among the Melodious Sneezers at this\r\nmoment would only disconcert them, impede their progress, and possibly\r\nso confuse them that all their efforts might be in vain. They, from\r\ntheir childhood, were so accustomed to wear those huge wooden shoes, to\r\nmove about on the surface of this treacherous mud, that if it were\r\npossible for human hands to restore his son to his arms, theirs would do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd so he spoke a few words of encouragement in my mother’s ear, and\r\ncontinued to stand like a statue, with his gaze riveted upon the long\r\nfiles of Melodious Sneezers, as they wound around the crest of the\r\nmountain to gain the spot where, as they judged, I had disappeared.\r\n\r\nArmed with their light, broad, wooden shovels, their dusky arms rose and\r\nfell with wonderful precision and regularity, keeping time with the\r\nmusical notes of their sneezing; now soft and low, now breaking out into\r\na wild and galloping measure.\r\n\r\nDown! Down! Down!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE PORTRAITS SHOWING THE WONDERFUL GROWTH OF MY\r\nBRAIN.]\r\n\r\nAnd yet they delved in vain!\r\n\r\nNo sign of me was there to gladden the hearts of my poor, grief-stricken\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nBut hark!\r\n\r\nWhat is that shrill cry?\r\n\r\nIt is not human!\r\n\r\nNo; for it is Bulger’s bark, or rather it is Bulger’s yelp.\r\n\r\nHe had been watching the band of Melodious Sneezers, as their white\r\nshovels rose and fell all in vain, with his head thrust through the\r\nrailings of the veranda.\r\n\r\nNo one was there with mind and heart enough to catch the meaning of that\r\npoor yelp.\r\n\r\nChew-chew-lô saw that his men were standing, leaning on their shovels,\r\nwith looks of doubt and hesitation in their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe King was silent.\r\n\r\nIt was the great baron who spoke:\r\n\r\n“Oh, let them not give o’er! My life, my wealth, my all, are thine,\r\ngood, kind Chew-Chew——”\r\n\r\nA fit of sneezing cut short his appeal.\r\n\r\nAgain Bulger’s cry was raised, and this time the King heeded it.\r\n\r\nAn attendant saw the royal nod, and hastening to bind broad wooden cups\r\nupon the dog’s feet, he was turned loose upon the surface of the mud.\r\n\r\nWhat is man, with his boasted intelligence?\r\n\r\nThey were ten paces or more distant from the point where I had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nYelping, barking, and whining by turns, my dear Bulger hurried to the\r\nspot where his unerring scent told him that his beloved little master\r\nhad gone down.\r\n\r\nAgain the band of Melodious Sneezers set to work with renewed vigor,\r\ntheir white shovels flashing with strange effect against the inky\r\nblackness of the mud.\r\n\r\nBulger encouraged them with loud and joyful barkings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a clear, ringing, melodious “chew” rent the air.\r\n\r\nThey had caught sight of me!\r\n\r\nWith rare foresight for one of my months, I had closed my nostrils with\r\none hand before reaching the mud, and had thus saved my lungs from\r\nfilling up.\r\n\r\nBut how useless would have been this precaution, had not my faithful\r\nBulger come to my rescue!\r\n\r\nHis joy now knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nI thought that I caught a glimpse of a smile on the old baron’s\r\ntear-stained cheek, as his boy was borne to the veranda, more like an\r\nanimated lump of earth than aught else, for the air had revived me. My\r\neyes were not only wide open, but they were the only clean place on my\r\nwhole body.\r\n\r\nUtterly regardless of my filthy condition, my fond mother clasped me\r\nconvulsively to her breast, and I verily believe that she would have\r\npressed her lips upon my mud-covered head and face, had she not seen the\r\nbaron’s broad palm held in suspicious proximity, while her mother’s\r\nheart was emptying itself out in words. A few basins of warm water, and\r\nI was myself again.\r\n\r\nNo, I was never myself again. My bath in the warm mud of Lâ-aah-chew-lâ\r\neffected a most remarkable change in me; it checked the growth of my\r\nbody and turned all my strength upwards into my head and brain.\r\n\r\nIn one short month my head almost doubled in size.\r\n\r\nMy baby face and expression were gone!\r\n\r\nAnd ere another moon had filled her horns I had grown to be a living\r\nwonder!\r\n\r\nNot only was the size of my head something remarkable, but from my eyes\r\nbeamed an astonishing intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe poor women of Lâ-aah-chew-lâ Land crouched in front of me as if I\r\nwere a being from another world and then tapping their foreheads they\r\napproached my mother and whispered:\r\n\r\n“Most gracious Chew-lâ-â-â-â-â-â the Great Spirit has made a mistake and\r\nput two souls in there instead of one!”\r\n\r\nAnd then they bent their graceful bodies till their foreheads touched my\r\nmother’s feet and withdrew, going out backwards like the best regulated\r\ncourt ladies, each leveling her finger at me and opening wide her eyes\r\nas she disappeared through the door.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene was so grotesque that I burst out into a shout of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing which, the poor creatures tumbled headlong over each other\r\nin their mad efforts to get outside of the house, shrieking at the top\r\nof their voices:\r\n\r\n“Save us! save us! He will bewitch us!”\r\n\r\n“Little Baron!” said my father in a tone of mock anger, “you should not\r\nhave frightened the ladies of King Chew-chew-lô’s Court!”\r\n\r\nChew-pâ! Chew-pâ! (Idiots! Idiots!) I replied, looking up from my slate\r\nupon which I was working out an example in arithmetic, for I was very\r\nfond of figures.\r\n\r\nIn fact, my father had already taught me addition by showing me how to\r\ntrade off worthless glass beads for valuable ivory, and division, by\r\ntaking away ninety cents from every dollar I made. Long before I could\r\nread or write, I knew the letters of several languages by name, and\r\ncould spell any word which had no silent letter in it. No one took more\r\ndelight in my wonderful accomplishments than Bulger.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to know instinctively that his little master was no ordinary\r\nbeing and respected him accordingly. We now bade adieu to the Land of\r\nLâ-aah-chew-lâ and the Melodious Sneezers.\r\n\r\nKing Chew-chew-lô with a mighty band of retainers accompanied us to his\r\nfrontier, making the forests resound with their melodious\r\nchew-chew-a-ing. Standing on the old baron’s shoulders, I waved them a\r\nlast goodbye to which they answered with such a perfect whirlwind of\r\nChew-chew-â’s that Bulger fairly howled with delight.\r\n\r\nAny special honor paid to his master was always a personal matter to\r\nhim. The elder baron had intended to penetrate still further into the\r\nheart of Africa; but the fact is, that the continual growth of my mind\r\nwas so wonderful that it engrossed his attention from morn till night.\r\nHe endeavored to hide this from me; but all to no purpose.\r\n\r\nBefore I was two years old my brain had grown so heavy that my mother\r\nwas obliged to sew pieces of lead in the soles of my shoes to keep me\r\nright end upwards, and yet, in spite of this precaution, I was often\r\nfound standing upon my head working out difficult mathematical problems\r\nby making use of my toes, as the Chinese do their counting machines.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which my father did upon reaching home was to take me to\r\na phrenologist in order to have a chart made of my head.\r\n\r\nThe examination lasted a month.\r\n\r\nAt length, upon the completion of the chart, it was found that I\r\npossessed thirty-two distinct bumps.\r\n\r\nWell-developed ones, too!\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, at once determined to engage thirty-two learned\r\ntutors, each tutor to have charge of a separate bump and to do his\r\nutmost to enlarge it even if it grew to be a horn.\r\n\r\nMy father was resolved to leave nothing undone in order to develop my\r\nmental powers to the utmost limit. I said nothing either for or against\r\nthe scheme.\r\n\r\nIn one short year I had learned all that the thirty-two tutors could\r\nteach me, and, what is more, I had taught each one of them fifty things\r\nwhich he had not known before, and which I had learned while traveling\r\nin foreign lands with my parents.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning to the great surprise of my thirty-two tutors I\r\ndischarged the whole of them.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron at my suggestion now sent a bill to each tutor for\r\nservices rendered him by me.\r\n\r\nEach tutor refused to pay.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron, at my suggestion, now caused legal process to be served\r\nupon each one of them.\r\n\r\nThe court upon hearing my testimony rendered an opinion which covered\r\nfive thousand pages of legal cap paper and required a whole week to\r\nread, in which they held that each thing which I had taught to each one\r\nof my thirty-two tutors was so remarkably strange and peculiar that in\r\nthe eye of the law it was worth at least one hundred dollars. That made\r\nthe bill of each tutor amount to five thousand dollars, or one hundred\r\nand sixty thousand dollars in all.\r\n\r\nThe court then adjourned for a year, all three judges being so worn out\r\nmentally and physically as to need a twelve months’ rest before taking\r\nup any other business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THREE WEARY JUDGES AS THEY APPEARED AT THE CLOSE OF\r\nMY SUIT AGAINST MY TUTORS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  How the elder Baron lost flesh worrying about the investment of my\r\n    money. Effect of his anxiety on the rest of the household. I take\r\n    the matter in hand and devise ways to increase my fortune. I become\r\n    extremely wealthy. When eight years of age I am seized with an\r\n    uncontrollable desire to visit far-away lands, and begin to pack up.\r\n    The elder Baron objects. How I set to work to get his consent. Wild\r\n    doings of my playfellows. How we stormed the castle, broke up the\r\n    hawking, ruined the fox hunt, summoned the ten doctors, and set fire\r\n    to the neighboring fields. The elder Baron grows weary of my doings\r\n    and consents to let me go. My delight and Bulger’s joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELDER BARON AND BARONESS GREW VERY THIN.]\r\n\r\nThe question which now occupied my father’s mind to the exclusion of all\r\nother thoughts was how to invest this large sum of money, so that upon\r\nmy attaining my twenty-first year I would be provided with a\r\nsufficiently large income to live as a baron should—particularly when he\r\nbelonged to so famous a family as ours.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, my father permitted this question to prey\r\nupon his peace of mind to such an extent that he lost flesh perceptibly.\r\n\r\nMy mother, too, seeing his lamentable condition began to fret and worry\r\nto such a degree, that she likewise became greatly emaciated. With their\r\nloss of flesh naturally their appetites dwindled and little or no food\r\nwas provided; or, anyway, no more than was just sufficient to satisfy\r\nBulger’s and my wants.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the servants began to lose flesh, both the indoor and outdoor\r\nones; and in their desperate attempt to keep body and soul together, the\r\nhorses and cattle were fed upon short rations, and the consequence was,\r\nthey, too, soon began to fall away.\r\n\r\nSo it grew to be quite a serious sight to see my poor father and mother\r\nreduced to mere skin and bones, driven about the country by mere shadows\r\nfor coachman and footman, and drawn by four horses whose bones fairly\r\nrattled under their skins when they were coaxed or beaten into a lazy\r\ntrot.\r\n\r\nBulger and I alone retained our plumpness and good spirits. At length I\r\ndetermined to interfere and put a speedy end to this deplorable state of\r\naffairs. I exacted from the elder baron a solemn promise that he would\r\nfollow my directions to the letter and not raise any objections, no\r\nmatter how wild or unreasonable they might appear to him, or to my\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR FAMILY COACHMAN BECOMES NOTHING BUT SKIN AND BONE.]\r\n\r\nThen bidding him to partake of some good, succulent food, retire early\r\nand get a nice long sleep, I saluted him respectfully and said:\r\n\r\n“Baron, until to-morrow morning!”\r\n\r\nI had scarcely finished my breakfast when my door opened and the elder\r\nbaron walked into the room.\r\n\r\nHe looked much refreshed. The color had returned to his cheek, the gleam\r\nto his eye.\r\n\r\nHe was already a different man.\r\n\r\n“Here, gracious Sir,” I began, handing him a parchment roll, “is a list\r\nof all the best known almanac makers in our land. Have interviews with\r\nthem at once and purchase from them the right to furnish weather\r\nprognostications for the coming year!”\r\n\r\nThe elder baron began to expostulate. “Baron!” I remarked sternly,\r\nraising my hand, “a true Knight has but one word to give!”\r\n\r\nHe was silent and motioned me to continue.\r\n\r\nI did so as follows:\r\n\r\n“Respected parent, when you have secured this right from each of them,\r\nreturn to me.”\r\n\r\nIn a few days my father had accomplished his mission.\r\n\r\nHe entered my room and put into my hands the needful concessions from\r\nevery noted almanac maker in the land.\r\n\r\nAgain I bade him refresh himself thoroughly, get a good night’s rest and\r\nsee me in the morning.\r\n\r\nAs Bulger and I were returning from breakfast the elder baron presented\r\nhimself at the door of my apartments.\r\n\r\nHe looked strong and well. His face had filled out again and his step\r\nhad recovered its old-time elasticity.\r\n\r\nAgain I placed a roll of parchment in his hands, and said to him:\r\n\r\n“Scatter the contents of that parchment evenly and plentifully\r\nthroughout each almanac, on the pages devoted to the months of November,\r\nDecember, January, and February.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me inquiringly, and his lips began to move.\r\n\r\n“Noble Sir!” said I, ere a sound had issued from his mouth, “in our\r\nfamily, knights have always been without fear and without reproach.” He\r\nbent his lofty form in silence and withdrew.\r\n\r\nPossibly the reader may have a little curiosity to know the contents of\r\nthe parchment roll which I placed in the hands of the elder baron on\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nIf brevity be the soul of wit, it was witty. If a fair round hand be the\r\ngarb of truth, it was truthful. Be this as it may choose to be, the\r\nwords which my pen had traced on that parchment roll, read as follows:\r\n\r\n“All signs point to an extremely cold Winter.” “Indications are that the\r\ncoming Winter will be the severest for half a century.” “Forecasts all\r\ngive the same answer—a Winter of exceptional length and bitter\r\ncoldness.” “Most skilled prognosticators agree in predicting a degree of\r\nlow temperature rarely reached in these latitudes.” “About this time\r\nexpect unusual cold.” “Protect plants.” “Now look well to your winter\r\nvegetables.” “Secure them from the extreme frost.” “Double your supply\r\nof winter fuel.” “Now look for fierce snow-storms.” “Expect bitter cold\r\nweather during all this month.” “Prepare for most unusual hail storms.”\r\n“Be on your guard for sudden and penetrating north winds.” “House cattle\r\nwarmly for all this month.” “Beware of deadly blizzards, they will come\r\nwith a furious onset.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few days’ absence, my father returned to the manor house. His\r\narrival was duly announced to me by Bulger, to whom I said: “Go, good\r\nBulger, and conduct the Baron to my apartment.”\r\n\r\nAway he bounded with many a sportive leap and bark, and soon returned,\r\nushered in the elder baron with the joyous manner so common to him when\r\nactive in serving me.\r\n\r\n“I have obeyed thee, my son!” murmured the elder baron with a stately\r\narc in his bending form.\r\n\r\n“’Tis well!” I replied, motioning him to be seated.\r\n\r\n“And now honored guide of my childhood’s uncertain feet, give heed to my\r\nwords: Our task is almost done. In a few days the investment of this\r\nmoney, which has occasioned thee so much anxiety, fairly robbing thee of\r\nthy heart’s service, will be complete; ay, complete; and, what is better\r\nstill, so fortunately invested that thou shalt be enabled to call\r\nthyself the father of one of the richest children in the Kingdom.”\r\n\r\n“Hearken, Baron. Go now into the leading markets of the land and put\r\nevery fur merchant under written contract to deliver unto thee in early\r\nAutumn all the pelts, dressed, undressed, or on the backs of the owners,\r\nof which they will guarantee the delivery under their hands and seals.”\r\n\r\nThe words had scarcely fallen from my lips ere the elder baron had risen\r\nfrom his chair and caught me warmly to his breast.\r\n\r\n“My son!” he cried as he stroked my protuberant brow, “it is a master\r\nstroke! It is worthy of a governor of a province! I long to begin the\r\ngood work. Permit me to set out this very night!” “Wait baron!” said I,\r\nleading him to his chair and gently constraining him to be seated.\r\n“Wait, Baron; there is somewhat yet to be said. When thou hast completed\r\nthe purchase of all the pelts, which are expected to enter the Kingdom\r\nthis year, expend the rest of the money in purchasing all the wood, coal\r\nand peat thou canst find, not that I would draw profit from the poor\r\nman’s slender store; but simply to keep others from wronging him by\r\ncombining against him, as they would surely do upon the first\r\npublication of the weather predictions.” “Ah, little Baron!” exclaimed\r\nmy father, “how thoughtful; for, as thou sayest, we must not lay a\r\nburden on the poor man’s shoulders!”\r\n\r\nSuch was the diligence with which my father carried my plans to\r\ncompletion, that in a single month I had bought and sold again the\r\nentire product of the fur market, at a small advance, it is true, but\r\nlarge enough to make me an extremely rich man.\r\n\r\nIt was so gently and skillfully done, that no one ever suspected the\r\nclever ruse by which I was enabled to acquire riches enough to set out\r\nupon my travels just as my inclination might prompt, and to know that\r\nwere I to be captured and held for ransom by the most grasping\r\nfreebooters, my bankers would have gold enough to ransom me.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of my eighth year I was seized with an\r\nuncontrollable desire to enter at once upon the fulfillment of my long\r\ncherished plans, to visit far-away lands inhabited by strange and\r\ncurious people. My own home, my own language, my own people, wearied me\r\nand wore upon me.\r\n\r\nIn my sleep I paced the deck of staunch vessels, shouted my orders,\r\ncrowding sail in calm and reefing in threatening weather. I passed my\r\ntime from morn till night, packing cases with suitable articles for\r\ntraffic with the savages, so that I might be able to penetrate into\r\ninteriors never visited by civilized man, and ascend rivers closed since\r\nthe world began to the white-winged messengers of trade and commerce.\r\nBut, strange to say, my father urged thereto, possibly, by the\r\nentreaties of my mother, firmly and resolutely set his face against my\r\nproject of leaving home.\r\n\r\nI was beside myself with disappointment. I entreated, I implored, I\r\nthreatened. For the first time in my life—it pains me even now to make\r\nthe confession—I was guilty of a certain disrespect to the authors of my\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nBulger, after studying the situation for several days, reached the\r\nconclusion that the elder baron was in some way the cause of my\r\nunhappiness, and it required, at times, my sternest command to restrain\r\nhim from setting his teeth in the calves of the elder baron’s legs as he\r\nquitted my apartment after some stormy interview.\r\n\r\n“What!” cried I, in tones tremulous with grief, “am I doomed to waste\r\nthe splendid gifts with which nature has endowed me, shut within the\r\nwalls of this petty town, whose most boisterous scenes are the brawls of\r\nits market places, whose people never witness a grander pageant than the\r\npassing of a royal troop of horse? It must not, it shall not be. Thou\r\nhast said, thyself, that I am no ordinary child to be amused with ball\r\nand top, and entertained with picture books.”\r\n\r\nBut the elder baron had hardened his heart, and all my pleading was to\r\nno purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I did not despair of gaining my point in the end.\r\n\r\nThe continual dropping of water finally wore away the rock. I made up my\r\nmind now to move the elder baron to acquiesce in my project of leaving\r\nhome by resorting to entirely different tactics. Said I to myself:\r\n\r\n“He wishes me to be a child: I’ll be one!” And forthwith I set about\r\nmaking friends with every mischievous little rogue in the town.\r\n\r\nNot a single juvenile ne’er-do-well escaped my attentions.\r\n\r\nThe more rampant, active, and tireless his power of mischief, the closer\r\nI wrapped him in my affections.\r\n\r\nFrom gray dawn to dewy eve these chums and boon companions of mine\r\nflocked about the castle. They worshipped me as their leader and yielded\r\nan implicit obedience to my commands as were I possessed of some mastery\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron saw the gathering cloud and bent his head as if to meet\r\nthe coming storm with better chance of resisting it.\r\n\r\nCame there a dinner party, the choicest Burgundy was found to have been\r\nspirited away and the bottles filled with common claret. Did the elder\r\nbaron meet his friends in the fields for a trial with the hawks, it was\r\nonly to discover that they had been so overfed as to sit stupidly placid\r\nwhen the hood was removed. Let the cook be told that guests were\r\nexpected, and that he must be careful to have the little dumplings of\r\nhis soup extra delicate, to the elder baron’s horror, a cherry stone\r\nwould be found in the centre of each little dumpling.\r\n\r\nOne of my coadjutors was venturesome enough to pilfer the elder baron’s\r\nsnuff box and fill it with pepper. The result may be imagined. Another\r\ntook good care to pour water into all the tinder boxes before the guests\r\ncalled for their pipes. Upon attempting to rise from the table, here and\r\nthere a queue would be found securely tied to the back of the chair.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite exploits was to station myself on the first landing\r\nof the stairway and “hold the bridge like Horatius Cocles of old,” my\r\nwild band of two dozen young barbarians rushing madly up the staircase\r\nwith screams, yells and vociferations which would have done credit to\r\nany horde of real savages I have ever visited, while I, with my wooden\r\nsabre, beat down their sticks, occasionally rapping too bold a youngster\r\non the knuckles and sending him bawling to the foot of the stairway, to\r\nBulger’s infinite amusement, as he always insisted upon taking part in\r\nthe fray and gloried in my prowess.\r\n\r\nAt last to my great joy, I noticed that the elder baron showed signs of\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nLike a prudent general I ordered an attack all along the line.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a fox hunt the next day. I directed one of my trusted\r\nlieutenants to feed the hounds all the raw meat they could swallow,\r\nabout an hour before the start.\r\n\r\nTen others, most fleet-footed and glib-tongued, I dispatched to the\r\nhouses of the ten leading physicians and surgeons of the town and its\r\nimmediate neighborhood, with the same message to each, namely, that\r\nevery man, woman and child at the manor house had been taken violently\r\nill, and that the greatest haste must be made to come with their\r\nmedicine chests so that the epidemic might be checked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEN BOTTLES OF MEDICINE BROUGHT BY THE TEN DOCTORS.]\r\n\r\nThe ten doctors galloped into the courtyard at nearly the same moment,\r\nonly to find the elder baron and his friends gathered on the platform\r\nand holding a whispered consultation over the strange actions of the\r\nhounds. The angry disciples of Galen refused to prescribe for the poor\r\nanimals, and galloped away again with their well-filled holsters\r\nthumping against their legs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had not been idle.\r\n\r\nTo the claws of a score or more of the elder baron’s fowls I tied a kind\r\nof fuzee of my own invention, so inflammable that the slightest friction\r\nwould cause it to burst into flame, and then I turned them loose in the\r\nfields and garden adjoining the family hall.\r\n\r\nThey had been cooped up all the Summer, and were overjoyed at the\r\nprospect of a good, comfortable scratching time ’mid the dry leaves and\r\nstubble of the open fields.\r\n\r\nThe gamekeepers by this time had succeeded in arousing the hounds\r\nsomewhat from their stupor, when the cry of “fire! fire!” went up. The\r\nhunting party hastily dismounted and joined the servants in the mad rush\r\nfor buckets of water.\r\n\r\nI was sitting calmly in my apartment, with Bulger by my side, when the\r\nalarm was raised.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron at first was inclined to think that although my\r\nworkmanship was plainly visible in the fabrics of mischief, which\r\nconsisted in overfeeding the hounds and summoning the ten doctors to the\r\nmanor house on a wild goose chase, yet the breaking out of the fire in\r\nthe neighboring gardens and fields was really something with which I had\r\nnothing to do. The return of a venerable old Dominick rooster, which had\r\nbeen either too feeble or too lazy to explode the fuzees attached to his\r\nclaws, settled the matter, however.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron’s mind was now clear as to who had conceived the crime\r\nin which his poor fowls had so unwittingly become the accomplices.\r\n\r\nThat night Bulger and I went to bed with light hearts.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron had at last consented to let us set out on our first\r\njourney in quest of strange adventures among the curious people of\r\nfar-away lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOWLS THAT WOULDN’T SCRATCH, AND SO BETRAYED ME.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  Preparations for my first voyage. The elder Baron selects the port\r\n    from which I am to sail. Description of port No Man’s Port. How I\r\n    escaped its quicksands, Whirlpool and Thor’s Hammer. Becalmed on the\r\n    Southern Seas, I rescue my ship in a wonderful way. Land ho!\r\n    Something about a beautiful Island. I leave my ship and start for\r\n    the interior. How I fell in with some most extraordinary beings.\r\n    Description of them. They leave me to go and request permission of\r\n    their chief to present me at his court. How I thought myself\r\n    attacked by a band of gigantic beings. My strange mistake. They\r\n    prove to be the same beings I had met the day before. What had\r\n    caused the transformation. The land of the Wind Eaters. I am\r\n    conducted to the court of Ztwish-Ztwish. More about the curious\r\n    people. The Chief’s affection for me. The bursting of the babies.\r\n    Go-Whizz becomes my enemy. I grow thin. Queen Phew-yoo wants me to\r\n    marry Princess Pouf-fâh. To regain my flesh I teach the Wind Eaters\r\n    to catch fish. Terrible accident resulting from a fire I had\r\n    kindled. Go-Whizz demands my death. Ztwish-Ztwish refuses. The\r\n    furious brawler tries to slay the Chief and is himself slain, by\r\n    Ztwish-Ztwish. To avoid the marriage with Pouf-fâh, I send Bulger\r\n    back to the ship, and then escape in the night. Too weak to bear the\r\n    fatigue, I am overtaken. Enmeshed in the nets of the Wind Eaters and\r\n    nearly beaten to death. Bulger rescues me. The relief party from my\r\n    ship come up with me. I reach the coast, and after a short rest,\r\n    sail for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGER HELPS ME WITH MY PACKING.]\r\n\r\nI threw myself now heart and soul into the task of making ready for my\r\nfirst voyage.\r\n\r\nBulger was not slow to understand what all the hurry-skurry meant.\r\n\r\nHe was delighted at the prospect of a trip to distant lands where life\r\nhad less monotony about it. By the hour he would sit and watch me at my\r\nlabors and, from time to time, to please him, I pointed out articles\r\nlying here and there about the room and bade him fetch them, which he\r\ninvariably did, with many manifestations of pleasure at being permitted\r\nto help his little master.\r\n\r\nIn fact, everybody lent a hand most kindly, so that, to my great\r\nsatisfaction, I was left more time for the study of navigation.\r\n\r\nMy poor mother, the gracious baroness, would not permit anyone else to\r\nmark my clothing. With her own slender, white fingers she worked the\r\ncrest and initials of my wardrobe.\r\n\r\nThere was a matter which I turned over in my thoughts for several days,\r\nto wit: What national garb I should adopt.\r\n\r\nAfter long and mature deliberation I resolved to attire myself in\r\nOriental dress. I did so for several reasons. It had been a favorite\r\ngarb of mine.\r\n\r\nIts picturesque grace appealed to my love of the beautiful, while on the\r\nother hand, its ease and lightness made it very agreeable to one of\r\nextreme suppleness of limb and elasticity of step. While the old manor\r\nhouse was being literally turned topsy-turvy and everybody, from cook to\r\nchambermaid, set by the ears, the elder baron was by no means idle. He\r\ntook good care, among other things, that I was well provided with\r\nwholesome reading matter, and brought me several books of maxims,\r\nprecepts, reflections, thoughts and studies, which he requested me to\r\nthrust into the empty corners of my chests, “for,” said he, and that,\r\ntoo, with a great show of reason, “thou wilt have many idle hours on thy\r\nhands in calm weather. It behooves thee to feed thy mind lest its\r\nwonderful development be checked and thou become as an ordinary child,\r\nwith no thoughts above games and picture books.” My poor mother, the\r\ngracious baroness, added to this stock of good literature by presenting\r\nme with a small volume entitled: “The Straight Road to Good Health; or,\r\nEverybody His Own Doctor.” As to my medicine chest, I gave that my\r\npersonal supervision, for I was always skilled in the art of reading all\r\nkinds of symptoms and was gifted with the rare faculty of knowing almost\r\ninstinctively what remedy to give for a certain ailment, without first\r\nexperimenting upon the patient by trying one thing after another, as is\r\nthe custom with most people who pretend to heal sickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUE PORTRAITS OF BULGER AND ME; I AS I APPEARED IN MY\r\nORIENTAL DRESS.]\r\n\r\nEverything was going well now, and I was in the best of spirits, when\r\nthe elder baron came to me with a proposal which, for some reason, I can\r\nhardly tell why, displeased me, although it would seem that it ought to\r\nhave had the opposite effect. He proposed to precede me, by a week or\r\nten days, to the North Sea, in some port of which I intended to purchase\r\nand fit out a swift, staunch vessel, purchase the vessel himself, give\r\nhis personal attention to fitting her out and shipping a crew of picked\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do?\r\n\r\nIf I refused his offer, it would have been tantamount to a confession of\r\ndistrust on my part.\r\n\r\nCan he have in mind any project to thwart my scheme?\r\n\r\nO, perish the thought!\r\n\r\nBut I must confess that I did not accept his proffered services without\r\nserious misgivings.\r\n\r\nThis sudden anxiety on the part of the elder baron to hurry my\r\ndeparture, after having opposed it so long and so vigorously, made me a\r\nlittle uneasy in my mind.\r\n\r\nBefore setting out for the North Sea to purchase a ship for me, the\r\nelder baron entered my apartment, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, little baron, for interrupting thy labors, for I perceive\r\nthat thou art deep in the study of navigation.”\r\n\r\n“Speak, Baron,” said I, looking up, with a mischievous smile, “that\r\nright belongs to thee.”\r\n\r\n“I have a last request to make,” he continued, in his usual calm manner,\r\n“nor is it a matter of very great importance. Rather is it a whim, more\r\nthan aught else. Thou knowest from my lips, and from the perusal of our\r\nfamily chronicles, that we were in ancient time very large land owners\r\non the coast of the North Sea. We controlled several ports, were\r\nextensively engaged in trade, sending out at least a score of ships in a\r\ntwelvemonth. One of the ports of our domain was a famous one, famous for\r\nthe extraordinary character of its inlet and outlet currents, channel,\r\netc. It was said of this port that it was more dangerous than the open\r\nsea, that vessels were really safer out of it than in it. I know not how\r\nmuch of truth may be in all this, but I do know that one man, an\r\nancestor of ours, not only sailed into it, but safely out again, for\r\nthou must know that the channel by which a vessel gained admission to\r\nthis port could not be used to leave it again, as the irresistible\r\ncurrent always flowed the one way, namely, from the sea into this\r\nmysterious basin. To leave it, the bold mariner must trust his bark to\r\nanother channel, and therein lurked the danger.\r\n\r\n“It would gratify me greatly, little baron, if thou couldst prove to the\r\nworld that, no matter how difficult, other captains once found, and now\r\nfind it, to sail out of this port, yet to thee it offered no\r\ninsurmountable obstacles, and therefore, am I come to ask thee to set\r\nsail from this port!”\r\n\r\n“It is called?” I asked carelessly, as I turned to a chart of the North\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n“Port No Man’s Port,” replied the baron.\r\n\r\n“I like its name,” said I. “Order my ship to await me there!”\r\n\r\nThe elder baron arose, and bending his body with stately grace,\r\nwithdrew. I accompanied him to the door and dismissed him with most\r\nrespectful obeisance.\r\n\r\n“Port No Man’s Port,” I answered. “Ah, here is the chart!” The\r\ndescriptive text reads as follows:\r\n\r\n“Abandoned for many years; ingress easy; egress so dangerous as to mean\r\nfatal injury, if not destruction, to sailing craft; outer channel\r\nblocked by a fearful whirlpool and swinging rock called “Thor’s Hammer;”\r\ninner basin extremely dangerous from constantly shifting sands; closed\r\nby order of the Royal Ministry of Commerce and Marine.” Upon finishing\r\nthe reading of these words I sprang up and began to pace the floor,\r\nwildly and half unconsciously.\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed in upon my brain. I was obliged to halt and cling to\r\nthe back of a tall oak chair, or I should have staggered and fallen to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nBulger was greatly alarmed and sent up a suppressed howl of grief. I\r\nspoke to him as calmly as I could to comfort him.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments the vertigo passed off and my mind cleared up\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n“Nay, it is impossible,” I whispered, “the elder baron could not be\r\nguilty of bad faith to me! Away with such a thought! He errs through\r\nthoughtlessness and lack of experience. He little knows the terribly\r\ndangerous character of the task he is setting me. To him, the talks of\r\nshipwreck and death within Port No Man’s Port are but the legends of\r\nold-time sailor-life. He has not the faintest suspicion that his\r\nrequest, so lightly made, exposes his only child, son and heir to a\r\nprincely fortune and honored name, either to be engulfed by these\r\nshifting sands, sucked down to destruction by this fearful whirlpool, or\r\ncrushed by a blow from Thor’s Hammer.\r\n\r\n“And yet why murmur?\r\n\r\n“It is too late to protest. Already the elder baron has proclaimed to\r\nthe world the, to him proud piece of news, that his son was about to\r\nrenew the old-time glories of his family! I must do one of two things:\r\nFace these dangers like a man of cool, calm courage, or condemn myself\r\nto a life of dull and listless activity, the magnate of a province and\r\nnot the hero of two worlds!\r\n\r\n“No! the die is cast!\r\n\r\n“I have said it and it is as good as done!\r\n\r\n“My ship sails from Port No Man’s Port, or this little body feeds its\r\nfish that day!”\r\n\r\nDoubtless my eyes brightened, and my cheeks took on a glow of crimson\r\nhue, for Bulger, who had been listening to my soliloquy with a most\r\npained expression on his face, as he vainly tried to get at the meaning\r\nof my words, now broke out into a very lively succession of barks,\r\nbounding and springing about the room in the wildest merriment. He knew\r\nonly too well that some terrible struggle had been going on in my mind.\r\n\r\nNow he realized that all was well. Faithful creature, if he could only\r\ntell his love, how he would put all human lovers to blush!\r\n\r\nAs the hour drew near for me to bid adieu to the baronial hall, that\r\ngood lady, the gracious baroness, my mother, suddenly thought of a\r\nthousand and one things which she deemed of the very greatest importance\r\nto me. She warned me that I was not to sleep in a draught; not to\r\npartake of freshly-baked bread; not to drink cold water while\r\noverheated; not to cut my finger nails too short; not to sleep with my\r\nmouth open; not to wear my underclothing longer than one week; not to\r\nneglect to brush my teeth; not to fail to have my hair cut with the new\r\nmoon; not to strain my eyes reading by a poor light not to swallow my\r\nfood without thoroughly chewing it; not to laugh while I had food in my\r\nmouth; not to attempt to stop a sneeze; not to neglect to pare my corns;\r\nnot to pick my teeth with a metal point; not to examine the end of my\r\nnose without a looking-glass; not to eat meat without pepper, or\r\nvegetables without salt; not to exert myself after a hearty meal; not to\r\nstand upon my leg while it was asleep; not to walk so fast as to get a\r\npain in my side; not to go to sleep until I had first rested on my right\r\nside; not to fail to take a pill if I saw flashes in the dark; not to\r\nneglect to tie a stocking around my neck in case my throat felt sore,\r\netc., etc., etc. When the moment came to take leave of the gracious\r\nbaroness, my good mother, I was deeply moved. All the servants and\r\nretainers, from indoors and out, filed in front of me, kissed my hand\r\nand showered blessings on me.\r\n\r\nI may safely say that the only being present not moved to tears was\r\nBulger. He was so anxious to get under way that he passed an hour or so\r\nracing from the manor house to the carriage and back again in a piteous\r\nendeavor to get the procession started.\r\n\r\nStart we did, at last.\r\n\r\nA hundred hands waved us a fond farewell.\r\n\r\nThe stately trees that shut in the baronial hall swayed solemnly. I was\r\nglad when we rolled out of the court yard for I needed rest and quiet.\r\n\r\nMy nerves had been on such a stretch for the past month that a change of\r\nscene brought me balm and relaxation.\r\n\r\nMy journey to the North Sea was quiet and uneventful.\r\n\r\nI found my ship safely anchored in Port No Man’s Port, and the elder\r\nbaron there in charge of her. He introduced me to the sailing-master,\r\npressed me in his own loving arms, and with a gracious smile and stately\r\nwave of the hand, seated himself in the family coach. His only adieu\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n“My son, thy wisdom comes to thee by inheritance. Thou couldst not have\r\nacquired it. Therefore, make a noble use of so noble a gift. Farewell!”\r\n\r\nI bent my head in silence. The carriage rolled away. I stood alone. Nay,\r\na true and loving friend was there. He looked up with his large,\r\nlustrous eyes, as if to say:\r\n\r\n“Don’t be sad, little master. No matter who goes, I’ll stay by thee\r\nforever!”\r\n\r\nTurning to my sailing-master, I ordered the ship’s launch to be manned,\r\nand began at once a survey of the mysterious port in which my ship lay\r\nanchored.\r\n\r\nI found it to be a roomy basin, shut in by a rock-bound shore. In places\r\nthe waters slept beneath black and glassy surfaces; in others, all was\r\nmovement and commotion. Its waves came boiling and bubbling against the\r\nlaunch with swirling masses of white sand, shifting hither and thither,\r\nas if condemned to perpetual unrest.\r\n\r\nThe fact that my men, while fishing in different parts of the bay, often\r\ncaught deep-sea fish, proved to me that Port No Man’s Port was traversed\r\nby a channel from four to six fathoms in depth.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty would be to fix the boundaries of this constantly\r\nshifting path long enough to sail across the basin.\r\n\r\nI next turned my attention to the whirlpool. It marked the junction of\r\nthe outer channel with the basin of Port No Man’s Port.\r\n\r\nHaving purchased a number of condemned hulks for the purpose of testing\r\nthe strength and fury of the whirlpool, I caused a strong hawser to be\r\nrigged to a capstan on shore, and was in this way enabled to let the\r\nlaunch approach within a ship’s length of the whirlpool with perfect\r\nsafety. In truth, it was, when roused to the full measure of its fury by\r\nthe intrusion of any large floating body, a sight to strike terror to\r\nthe stoutest heart!\r\n\r\nWith a deep booming and rumble, its waters rose in tumultuous commotion,\r\nboiling, bubbling, seething, till snow-white foam covered the pool like\r\na mantle of bleached linen, then lifting the intruder, which in this\r\ncase was one of the hulks that I had ordered to be launched upon them,\r\nthese angered waters whirled it completely around. In an instant, as if\r\nexhausted by this tremendous effort, a mysterious calm sank upon the\r\npool. The foam-sheet, broken in shreds, danced gently on the rippling\r\nbosom of the waters. All was peace, save that the hulk still lay\r\ntrembling like an affrighted being in the lap of this resting monster!\r\n\r\nFor, look! It is aroused again. Faster and faster it whirls its prey.\r\nDeeper and deeper its now wide-opened jaws draw down the ill-fated hulk!\r\n\r\nA terrible roar tells that the end is near!\r\n\r\n’Tis gone!\r\n\r\nAy, but wait! It will give up its prey again!\r\n\r\nEven now bits of plank float seaward, dancing on the rushing waters.\r\n\r\nSoon the crumpled, broken, crushed remnants of that strong hulk will\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThis watery monster doth not feed upon what he swallows! He destroys for\r\nthe mere love of destruction. Night had come now. I returned to my ship.\r\nThe shifting sands and the whirlpool had uncovered their horrors. But I\r\nfeared them no more! Like the horse-tamer when he has at last succeeded\r\nin thrusting the steel bit between the champing and gnashing teeth of\r\nthe wild young steed, I now felt that they were conquered.\r\n\r\n“And now for Thor’s Hammer!” was my cry, as I sat down beside Bulger for\r\na brief moment’s reflection.\r\n\r\nThe first streak of gray light in the east found me on deck.\r\n\r\n“Thor’s Hammer” was a huge shaft of black, flinty rock, projecting about\r\ntwenty feet out of the water and ending in a hammer-shaped head. It\r\nguarded the channel where it reached the sea, standing exactly in the\r\nmiddle, thus forcing a vessel to pass on one side or the other of it.\r\n\r\nBeneath the waters, this dread sentinel must have ended in a gigantic\r\nball, which, in the flight of time had worn a socket for itself in the\r\nbed rock of the channel; for it swung loose and free, moved by every\r\npowerful billow from side to side, threatening swift destruction to any\r\npassing craft.\r\n\r\nTo speak frankly, the sight of this terrible engine of destruction\r\nappalled me! How shall I escape the vigilance of this gigantic sentinel,\r\nwho knows no sleep, no rest, whose blows fall with like fury on friend\r\nor foe? How shall I lull him to repose for a few brief moments?\r\n\r\nDetermined to study closely the strength, the rapidity, and the\r\ncharacter of the blows struck by “Thor’s Hammer,” I caused several huge\r\nstructures of plank and timber to be erected near the position of this\r\nmighty sentinel of rock. One after the other I ordered them to be thrown\r\ninto the channel.\r\n\r\nAt first, I was fairly paralyzed upon discovering that even the slight\r\nvortex caused by the drifting by of one of these wooden structures set\r\nthe swinging rock in violent vibration and always towards the passing\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nJudging from the effect of Thor’s Hammer upon these floating masses of\r\nplank and timber, a single blow would suffice to crush the very life out\r\nof my ship in spite of her unusual staunchness.\r\n\r\nI stood transfixed with dread forebodings. I could feel the beads of\r\nperspiration break from my forehead and trickle down my cheeks. Must I\r\ngive up and return home, broken in spirits, humiliated, the butt of\r\nridicule, the target of village wit, the subject of mirth and laughter\r\nin every peasant’s cottage?\r\n\r\nOh, no! It can not, it must not be!\r\n\r\nLike a flash of lightning, a thought flamed across the dark horizon of\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\nAm I not dreaming? Was it really so?\r\n\r\nOne of the wooden structures still remained. Controlling my emotion with\r\ngreat difficulty, I ordered it thrown into the channel and took up a\r\nfavorable position to watch once again the wrath of the towering\r\nsentinel! In a few moments “Thor’s Hammer” felt the coming of the craft\r\nand bent itself in impotent rage beating the air with blows which fell\r\nfaster and faster! Ay, I was right! When once Thor’s Hammer had begun\r\nits labor of death and ruin, it turned not from its task, so long as\r\nthere remained any object for it to spend its fury upon!\r\n\r\nNor was there any escape for the ill-fated craft until it had been\r\npounded into flinders! Hanging over it, blow followed blow with fearful\r\nclash and clamor. Not until the poor remnant had drifted seaward, did\r\nthat black and flinty shaft cease its furious swinging.\r\n\r\nTurning to my sailing-master, who stood with his wondering eyes fixed\r\nfull upon me, I called out in a calm and careless tone: “In three days,\r\nskipper, if the weather is clear, we leave Port No Man’s Port!”\r\n\r\nA lump rose up in his throat, but he gulped it down, and cried out\r\nmerrily:\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, sir.”\r\n\r\nAnd what three busy days they were, too! My men were not long in\r\ncatching something of the indomitable spirit of their new commander. I\r\nworked them hard, but I fed them well, served out grog with a liberal,\r\nbut wise hand, and saw that all their wants were satisfied. In turn,\r\ntheir wonderment became admiration, and their admiration affection.\r\n\r\nThe first day all the hands that could be spared were set to work making\r\nfishing lines, with a good, stout hook at one end and a cork float at\r\nthe other. The lines were cut about three fathoms in length, and the\r\nfloats were painted a bright crimson. I then gave orders to rig three\r\njury-masts, one midships, and one fore and aft.\r\n\r\nMy men set to work with a will, but I caught them several times in the\r\nact of tapping their foreheads and exchanging significant glances. But\r\nif this last order threw them into a brown study, my next had the effect\r\nof a bombshell exploding in their midst.\r\n\r\nSailing-master and all, they stood staring at me as if they were only\r\nwaiting for me to annihilate them.\r\n\r\nMy order was to rig a steering gear under the figure-head. A coasting\r\nvessel, which I had sent for, now came sailing leisurely into Port No\r\nMan’s Port. I directed the skipper to pay her crew three months’ extra\r\nwages, and discharge them.\r\n\r\nThis done, my men were ordered to lash the coaster on our starboard\r\nside.\r\n\r\nI verily believe that my whole plan, so carefully studied out, was at\r\nthis point only saved from utter failure by the wisdom of my faithful\r\nBulger.\r\n\r\nThe coaster had no sooner been lashed to our side than he sprang lightly\r\nover the railing, and began to amuse himself by gamboling up and down\r\nthe clear deck. Suddenly he paused near one of the hatches and broke out\r\ninto a most furious barking. I called to one of my officers to look\r\nsharp and see what the matter was. He reported in a few moments that one\r\nof the discharged seamen had been found concealed in the hold. When I\r\nthreatened to put him in irons, he confessed that his design had been to\r\ncut the coaster loose as soon as our ship had drawn near to the\r\nwhirlpool.\r\n\r\nIt was a narrow escape.\r\n\r\nDear, faithful Bulger, how much we owe thee for that discovery!\r\n\r\nThe third day dawned bright and fair.\r\n\r\nThe wind was most favorable, blowing strong off shore.\r\n\r\nAt the first glimmer of light, my men were astir and on the lookout for\r\nmy appearance.\r\n\r\nThey greeted Bulger and me with three hearty cheers.\r\n\r\nThey had made up their minds that what I didn’t know, Bulger did! At\r\nlast all was ready!\r\n\r\nI nodded to the sailing-master, and in a moment or so the capstan began\r\nto revolve, and the merry “Yo, heave O!” of the men told me that the\r\nanchor had been started. Hundreds of the lines and floats, well-baited,\r\nwere now cast overboard. Standing on the taffrail, glass in hand, I\r\nwatched them closely and anxiously.\r\n\r\nImagine my joy at seeing several of these crimson floats disappear like\r\na flash, rise again, and again vanish for an instant.\r\n\r\n“The first point is gained,” I cried out. “I have found the channel!”\r\n\r\nPassing word quickly to the sailing-master who was in charge of the\r\nsteering gear, my good vessel moved slowly out of Port No Man’s Port,\r\nstern first. Again and again the baited lines with their crimson floats\r\nwere thrown overboard. The deep water fish that swarmed the\r\never-shifting channel kept steadily at work. As our ship advanced, they\r\ntugged at the lines and thus kept the tortuous course plainly marked\r\nout. Glass in hand, I watched the successful working of this part of my\r\nplan, with tingling veins and a bounding heart. A loud huzza from my men\r\ntell me that we have cleared the shifting sands. Ay, true it is! We have\r\ncrossed the basin of Port No Man’s Port! Its dreaded quicksands swirl\r\nand roll in vain. It was not fated that they should engulf the Little\r\nBaron’s ship!\r\n\r\nBut see! The channel narrows! The waters grow black, and troubled. And\r\nhark!\r\n\r\nDidn’t you hear that dull roar? I spring down from the taffrail! I pass\r\namong my men and drop here and there a word of encouragement. My perfect\r\ncalmness impresses them. No merry “ay, ay, Sir!” goes up, but I see a\r\nresponse in their faces. It is: “We trust you little captain, speak!”\r\nThe dull roar grows louder and louder.\r\n\r\nThe rapids catch us up and bear us along like chips on the foaming tide\r\nof a mountain stream. Our staunch vessel rocks like a toy boat. The\r\ncoaster lashed to one side creaks and groans in its wild efforts to\r\nbreak away.\r\n\r\nCalling Bulger to me I pass the line around him and lash him firmly to\r\nthe main-mast, for I was fearful lest a sudden lurch might hurl him\r\noverboard. On, on, we speed through the frightened waters. The roar is\r\ndeafening. I glance at my seamen. Their bronzed faces are blanched. They\r\ncling to the shrouds and stays. Their eyes are riveted upon me.\r\n\r\nLook! the fearful whirlpool is dead ahead of us. It opens its\r\nfoam-flecked jaws like some terrible monster. We leap into its very\r\nmouth. Are we lost? How can it be otherwise? As if our staunch vessel\r\nwere a nutshell, the swirling, raging, whirling, battling, boiling\r\nwaiters catch her up in their encircling arms, lift her high above the\r\nsea level, turn her completely around and drop her with such terrific\r\nforce that great walls of water rise on all sides and threaten to engulf\r\nthe frail wooden thing. But most wondrous change; mark how she floats\r\nupon a glassy pool! The foam dances in the sunlight on the rippling\r\nwaves. All is peace where but a moment before nature raged with demoniac\r\nfury. Quick as thought I leap into the mizzen shrouds: “Cut away the\r\njury-masts!” They fall overboard with a crash. My men work with a mad\r\nearnestness. They know too well that every instant may be their last.\r\nOur mainsail already hoisted is sheeted home without a word or a cry. We\r\nare too near death to sing! See! See! The wind fills the great sail! We\r\nmove. The waters seem to scent our escape. They are awaking to new fury.\r\nA deep rumble from the very bowels of the earth calls upon them to\r\narouse from their lethargy.\r\n\r\nThey reach out for us.\r\n\r\nToo late! too late!\r\n\r\nWe sweep out of their reach. We are saved! We are saved! A shout goes up\r\nfrom two score throats, from which Fear now takes her hand!\r\n\r\nLook back! As if robbed of its prey, the whirlpool awakes with redoubled\r\nfury.\r\n\r\nA hundred arm-like streams of water gush forth and pour around our good\r\nship in vain effort to draw her back into that terrible vortex.\r\n\r\nWe are drenched with clouds of spray and mist, as we slowly but steadily\r\nkeep on our course. Would that we were safe upon the swelling tide of\r\nthe open sea, for there is still another danger to be met.\r\n\r\nOur channel suddenly narrows. I could toss a biscuit to the rocky wall,\r\nwhich shuts us in on both sides.\r\n\r\nAgain a deep silence falls upon ship and crew, broken only by a strange\r\nsound of rushing waters, bursting out and dying away as regularly as the\r\nswing of a pendulum. ’Tis Thor’s Hammer, beating the frightened waters\r\ninto foam, as it sways from side to side.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my effort to appear calm, I can feel my heart beat faster.\r\n\r\nA cold chill benumbs my hands. A glance ahead startles me like a blow\r\nfrom an unseen hand. There, with the morning sun resting on its\r\nhammer-shaped crest, swings that dreaded shaft of flinty rock,\r\nthreatening instant destruction to any ship bold enough to attempt to\r\npass it.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with my orders, every sail on the coaster had been set,\r\nand her helm lashed, so as to pass to the right of Thor’s Hammer.\r\n\r\n“Courage, men!” I cried. “Stand by, all! Cut away the lashings! Cast off\r\nthe tender!”\r\n\r\nThen waving my hand to the skipper, our mainsail came down with a run.\r\nEverything worked like a charm. Our ship slowed up, while the coaster\r\nshot ahead to her destruction. See, how gallantly the doomed craft\r\nspeeds on her way; for the breeze had freshened, and several gay\r\nstreamers and flags, which my men had run up to the topmast, fluttered\r\nin the crisp morning air.\r\n\r\nThere! Did you not hear that crash?\r\n\r\nThor’s Hammer has struck her!\r\n\r\nBlow follows blow!\r\n\r\nCrash! Crash! Crash!\r\n\r\nNow is our time, or never!\r\n\r\nI was not caught napping. The moment we were clear of the coaster, I had\r\nordered sails enough to be set to hold our ship steady on her course.\r\n\r\nAlready we drew near to Thor’s Hammer, which is fast battering the\r\ncoaster to a shapeless mass. The sea is filled with bits of plank and\r\nbroken timber. Thor’s Hammer bends to its dread work of destruction,\r\nunmindful of our presence.\r\n\r\nWhat could withstand its terrible fury?\r\n\r\nThose sturdy timbers yield like twigs.\r\n\r\nAnother minute, and we have the monster and his victim in our wake!\r\n\r\nNow, now, we’re passing him! Our sails tremble from the very force of\r\nhis breath! Our deck is strewn with splinters! The roar and crash are\r\ndeafening. Thor’s Hammer bends for one last blow at the ribs and keel of\r\nits broken and disjointed victim!\r\n\r\nHurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\nOur good ship dips to the deep roll of the ocean’s breast! We are on the\r\nopen sea! Port No Man’s Port, farewell!\r\n\r\nAs my men looked back at the rocky gateway and the grim sentinel of Port\r\nNo Man’s Port, they tossed their caps into the air and sent up cheer\r\nafter cheer.\r\n\r\nBulger bounded about the deck, doing his best by most vigorous barking,\r\nto testify his admiration for his little master.\r\n\r\nThe sailing-master drew near; and, touching his cap and scratching the\r\ndeck with the toe of his shoe, cried out gayly:\r\n\r\n“Bravo! little Baron. That was splendidly done! I was sure we should\r\nnever get through the shifting sands. And when they were passed, I was\r\nready to swear the whirlpool would make short work of us. But when we\r\nsailed safely out of that, I drew near the tail rail ready to jump\r\noverboard, for I felt that nothing could save us from a blow from Thor’s\r\nHammer. I’ve grown wrinkled and gray facing the storms of Neptune’s\r\ndomain, but I never felt I had a master until now.”\r\n\r\nI nodded and smiled, and quickly turned the conversation to some other\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\n“By the way, skipper,” said I, “remember, the very moment we clear the\r\nEnglish Channel, turn her head southward!”\r\n\r\n“Ay! ay! little Baron!” was the reply. Calling Bulger to me I now went\r\nbelow. I wanted to be alone. The fact of the matter is, I needed rest.\r\nThe terrible strain on my nerves caused by the hopes and fears of the\r\npast few days, began to tell upon me.\r\n\r\nThrowing myself upon a canopy, I fell into a deep sleep from which I was\r\nawakened by Bulger’s whining and crying.\r\n\r\nThe sailing-master was anxiously feeling my pulse.\r\n\r\nI had slept three days and three nights. All this time Bulger had\r\nabsolutely refused to leave my side or partake of food, although the\r\nskipper had tempted him with the daintiest morsels.\r\n\r\nHis joys knew no bounds as I sprang up and shook myself into shape.\r\n\r\n“Where are we, master?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“On the broad Atlantic, headed dead south, little Baron!” was the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n“Good! send me a rasher of bacon and some hard-tack. The Atlantic breeze\r\nhas given me an appetite and, skipper,” I added, “a little broiled fowl\r\nfor Bulger.”\r\n\r\n“And now, for the land of warmth and sunshine!” I murmured, “now for the\r\nhome of the orange and the palm! Cold winds like me not, I am a child of\r\nthe tropics, born in a land where nature works and man plays. No chill\r\nblast ever whistled its sad tune over my cradle! Let those who will,\r\nspend one-half their lives waiting for mother Earth to wake from her\r\nWinter sleep! Freeze the body and you freeze the brain. I am of those\r\nwho love flowers better than snowflakes. Glorious South land! I greet\r\nthee, thy child comes again to thy arms, oh, take him up kindly and\r\nlovingly!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSouthward, ever southward my good ship sped along. By day I paced the\r\ndeck to watch the dolphins at play or to observe Bulger’s amazement when\r\na stray flying fish fell fluttering on deck; by night, with my eyes\r\nfixed upon the blazing Southern Cross, I longed for the time to come\r\nwhen I should set foot upon some beautiful strand decked out with coral\r\nbranch and shells of pearl, in whose limpid waters golden fish nestle\r\nmid sea plants of not less brilliant hue.\r\n\r\nIt was now three weeks since the last murmur of Thor’s Hammer had fallen\r\non our ears.\r\n\r\nMy chronometer marked high noon. Every sail was set and our good ship\r\ncareened as gracefully as a swallow that bent in its flight to touch the\r\ncool waters of some glassy lake. All of a sudden the wind fell, our ship\r\nstood still on the motionless sea, my pennant hung like a string. There\r\nwas not air enough to lift the smoke from our galley fire. A strange\r\nmysterious stillness weighed upon the ship and sea. I knew too well what\r\nit betokened. One of those dreaded calms, more feared by the seamen that\r\nthe buffeting gale, had overtaken us.\r\n\r\nOur ship stood like one moored to a marble wharf!\r\n\r\nAnd as the thought flashed across my mind that days, ay even weeks might\r\npass ere the winds would lift themselves again to bear us on our way, a\r\nfeeling of utter listlessness came over me. It required a great exertion\r\nfor me to throw it off.\r\n\r\nI dared not let my men see aught of discouragement in my face.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, it was a hard task. Had I not been made of stern stuff, I would\r\nhave wept to see my progress stayed at the very moment victory was\r\nalmost within my grasp.\r\n\r\nAgain, as was the case, when the terrors of Port No Man’s Port rose,\r\nlike demons of malignant might, to shut me forever in that\r\nrock-encircled basin, did my thoughts revert to home—to the elder baron\r\nand his gracious consort, my dear mother; to the servants and retainers\r\nof the baronial hall; to the villagers and tenantry. How, oh how should\r\nI be able to face them all, if I were forced to return home with the\r\nhumiliating confession that my voyage had been a failure?\r\n\r\nBulger was the first to catch a glimpse of the shadow on my brow. He\r\nturned his dark lustrous eyes full upon me so pleadingly as if to say:\r\n“Oh, little master, what aileth thee? May I not do aught to drive the\r\ndark melancholy from thy face? Thou knowest how I love thee. Teach me to\r\nhelp thee. My life is thine. Thy grief weighs like lead on my heart.\r\nSpeak to me little master!” Tenderly and lovingly I stroked his head,\r\nand spoke in softest tones to him. He was rejoiced, but still he sat and\r\nwatched me, for it was impossible to deceive him by feigning to be\r\nlighthearted and unconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe second week found us lying like a log in a millpond, our sails\r\nunvisited by the faintest breath of air; the sea sunken into a sleep\r\nthat seemed like death. Despair sat on the faces of my men. “Rouse thee,\r\nlittle baron!” I murmured to myself as I paced my cabin floor, “where is\r\nthy boasted cunning? Where is thy vaunted wisdom? Nevermore say that\r\nthou art a man of projects, quick to devise, and quick to perform! Thou\r\nhast lost thy hold on the spoke of fortune’s wheel!”\r\n\r\n“Thinkest thou so?” cried I in answer to my own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Follow me, we shall see!” With a bound I cleared the gang way. The\r\nsailing-master lay asleep on the deck. The men in groups, here and\r\nthere, looked the very picture of despair. Rousing the skipper with a\r\nvigorous tug at his belt, aided by Bulger’s frantic outburst of barking,\r\nI called out:\r\n\r\n“Avast! there, skipper. Asleep from overwork? Pipe all hands on deck!”\r\nThe men came up in lively fashion, greatly amused by my cut at the\r\nsailing-master, who stood rubbing his eyes, half dazed by my sudden\r\noutburst. “Send me the ships carpenter!” I continued; and catching up a\r\npiece of chalk I drew the plan of a large box or chest, nearly as long\r\nas our ship’s breadth of beam, and gave the carpenter directions to\r\nbuild it of the strongest planks to be had on board. He and his\r\nassistants were soon at work.\r\n\r\nTurning then to the cook I ordered him to kill the pigs and fowls we had\r\nshipped for our own supply of fresh meat, bidding him to be careful and\r\nnot lose a drop of the blood.\r\n\r\nThese orders fairly drove my men wild with curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe sailing-master drew near and attempted to get some explanation from\r\nme but in vain. I was too deep in thought to speak.\r\n\r\nThe long box was ready in a few hours. Word now went up that I was about\r\nto abandon the ship and strive to reach land by rowing, and that this\r\nlong box was to hold the provisions.\r\n\r\nThe sailing-master again fixed his gaze inquiringly upon me. I pretended\r\nnot to notice his beseeching looks. The cook by this time had the fresh\r\nmeat in readiness. Under my directions it was all transferred to the\r\nlong chest, the blood poured over it, and the box securely closed with a\r\nheavy plate-glass lid, made up of several pieces shipped for the purpose\r\nof restoring broken lights. By this time the men had grown so excited\r\nover this mysterious box and its still more mysterious contents, that I\r\nwas obliged to order them to fall back so that the carpenter and his\r\nassistants might go on with their work without interruption.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to weight the long chest with lead and to attach\r\nhoisting tackle to each end by strong iron rings. When all was ready I\r\ncalled out to my men to stand by and lower it over the stern rail.\r\nStationed so that I could watch the lowering of the long box, I was\r\ncareful to sink it about three feet under water and then lash it firmly\r\nto the ship’s stern. I had scarcely given the word to lower away on all\r\nthe sails when the ship began to move! The effect on my men was\r\nindescribable. Some turned pale and stood as if transfixed with fear.\r\nOthers laughed in a wild maniac-like way. Others, who had their wits\r\nabout them, rushed to the stern taffrail to fathom the mystery.\r\n\r\nA glance was enough!\r\n\r\nIt was a simple thing after all.\r\n\r\nGradually the others recovered their reason, and hastened to join their\r\ncompanions and gaze down into the waters where I had lashed the long\r\nbox, with its glass lid and strange contents. Meanwhile our good ship\r\nmoved faster and faster through the sluggish, listless waters. A ringing\r\ncheer, three times repeated, went up when the mystery was fully solved.\r\n\r\nMystery?\r\n\r\nHear then what this mystery consisted of!\r\n\r\nIn the first days of this dead calm, which settled like a terrible\r\nblanket spread over us by the hands of some unseen monster, to check our\r\nadvance, I had noticed that the waters swarmed with sharks of\r\nextraordinary length; that these fierce demons of the deep hung about\r\nour vessel in shoals of countless numbers, attracted by the garbage\r\nthrown overboard, and, doubtless, too, by the odor of the many living\r\nbeings on board the ship.\r\n\r\nWhen, at times, a particularly large supply of garbage fell into the\r\nwater, so fierce was the onslaught of these ravenous monsters, that they\r\nactually jarred the ship as they struck against its sides or stern,\r\nlocked together like advancing cohorts of trained soldiery.\r\n\r\nUpon this hint I acted. If, as I reasoned, I can only control this now\r\nwild force, why may I not make use of it to rescue my ship from a worse\r\ndanger than raging storm? For far better would it be to face the howling\r\nblast and foam-crested wave than to perish from thirst, chained to the\r\nopen sea by this breathless calm.\r\n\r\nNow, however, all was changed.\r\n\r\nOn, on, our good ship went, with ever-increasing speed, gliding\r\nnoiselessly and swiftly through the mirror-like waters. My device worked\r\nfar better than I had dared to dream, for, as the fresh blood began to\r\ntrickle through the crevices of the long box, the ravenous sea monsters\r\nwere almost maddened by its smell and taste. The largest and fiercest\r\npressed forward in serried ranks, tossing their smaller companions high\r\nin the air, as they took up their places with wild and eager search for\r\nprey which lured them on, ever so near them, and still ever beyond their\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the foremost ranks of this army of myrmidons of the deep\r\nshow signs of fatigue than long lines of fresh and eager recruits darted\r\nforward, hurling their exhausted fellows right and left, like bits of\r\ncork, and took up the task of following the ever-retreating prey, which,\r\nalthough giving out its life blood, and plainly visible to them, yet\r\nseemed to know no tiring, and sped onward, and ever onward before the\r\nwild, tumultuous attack of their pushing, plunging cohorts!\r\n\r\nThe moon now shone like a plate of burnished silver on the blue walls of\r\nheaven, and the deep silence of the sleeping waters was broken by the\r\nsplash of those mighty bodies, glistening in her light, as they toiled\r\nand struggled to urge our vessel on its way.\r\n\r\nI could not sleep.\r\n\r\nWrapped in a woolen cloak, to shield me from the insidious dews of the\r\ntropics, I threw myself on deck, with Bulger’s head pillowed on my lap.\r\n\r\nSomething whispered to me that if those hunger-stricken marauders of the\r\ndeep would only keep to their task till the morning sun streaked the\r\neast, my cheek would feel the breath of coming winds.\r\n\r\nAnd so it turned out. With the first glimmer of daylight I caught sight\r\nof a ripple on the lake-like bosom of the ocean. At that very moment,\r\ntoo, I noticed that our ship was slowing up. I sprang up on the\r\ntaffrail. Lo! our allies had abandoned us. Not a single follower of that\r\nriotous camp was in sight! Ah, little did they dream how they had saved\r\nship and crew! How limitless is man’s selfishness! The beasts of the\r\nfield, the monsters of the deep must minister to his pleasure, obey his\r\ncommands. I had pointed out the ripple in the water and when the first\r\nsturdy breath of wind reached us we were in readiness to receive it.\r\nEvery sail was set.\r\n\r\nMy heart leaped with joy as our ship drew up to the wind, obeying her\r\nhelm like a thing of life!\r\n\r\nAnd that was the way I saved my ship and crew from a worse danger than\r\nstorm-lashed billows. From this time on, all went well. Scarcely a week\r\nhad gone by when I was startled by a cry which sounded sweeter to my\r\nears than voice of monarch to courtier.\r\n\r\n“Land ho! Dead ahead!”\r\n\r\nSeizing my glass I sprang up into the main-shrouds, and turned my gaze\r\nin the direction indicated. Ay, true it was! There it lay before us,\r\nrising from the ocean with gentle slope, its heights crowned with trees\r\nof many-colored foliage, its shores ending in long stretches of\r\nsnow-white beach.\r\n\r\nAbove the unknown land hung a purple mist of a deep rich tint, like the\r\ncheek of a ripe plum. As we drew near a landlocked harbor seemed to\r\nwelcome us. Not a sound or sign of life, however, came to break the deep\r\nrepose which enveloped the bay and shore.\r\n\r\nSlowly and in stately bearing our good ship sailed into the harbor and\r\ncast anchor. The radiant beauty of the land now burst upon me. Ten\r\nthousand shells of pearly tints and hues glistened on the white sands,\r\nwhile in the limpid waters, sea-flowers and foliage of deepest crimson\r\nswayed gently with the tide. Up the sloping banks nature seemed to be\r\nholding high carnival. No shrub or bush or tree was content to wear\r\nsimple green. Each waved some blossom of richest radiance in the soft\r\nand balmy air. Here and there, a brooklet came tumbling down the\r\nhillside, rippling, purling and splashing over the moss-grown rocks in\r\nits bed. The air was heavy with the fragrance of this vast garden so\r\nbeautiful and yet so silent and deserted.\r\n\r\nThe next day, leaving my sailing-master in command, I set out on a\r\ntramp, accompanied solely by my faithful Bulger. My idea was to see if\r\nthis island, for such I thought it to be, contained anything quaint and\r\ncurious. The further I advanced into the interior of this fair land of\r\nbright flowers, purling brooks, clear skies and perfumed air, the more\r\nwas I astonished to find that neither vine, shrub, brush, nor tree bore\r\nany berry or fruit to feed upon; and though it was just such a land of\r\nbrooks, flowers and balmy air as some dweller of the far-away North\r\nmight dream about; yet was it untrodden by the foot of man, for, rare\r\nindeed is it that the people of the tropics are willing to prepare any\r\nother food for themselves than that which nature spreads before them.\r\n\r\nI now began to be thankful that I had supplied myself plentifully with\r\ndried fruits before leaving my ship to set out for a tour of the island,\r\nfor such it seemed to me to be.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Bulger halted, and raising his nose in the air, sniffed\r\nhard and long, and then fixed his dark eyes on me as much as to say:\r\n“Take care, little master, some sort of living creatures are\r\napproaching!” I had hardly time to draw one of my pistols and give a\r\nhasty glance at its priming when with strange cries and stranger\r\nmovements a dozen or more beings of the human species sprang out of the\r\nthicket with noiseless steps, and surrounded us. I raised the fire-arm,\r\nwhich I held grasped in my right hand, ready to stop the advance of this\r\nband of most curious creatures, by slaying their leader; for, judging by\r\nthe forbidding aspect of their faces and the terrible condition of their\r\nbodies, apparently reduced by the dread pangs of hunger, to mere sacks\r\nof skin hung on frames of bone, which methought rattled at every step\r\nthey took, I anticipated an instant attempt on their part to strike us\r\ndown and eat us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE BARON MAKES FRIENDS WITH GO-WHIZZ AND HIS BAND\r\nOF WIND EATERS.]\r\n\r\nBut I was very quickly reassured. First, by the fact that they bore no\r\nweapons of any kind; and second, by the softness of their voices and the\r\nwalkingbeam-like motions of their bodies, which I interpreted to mean a\r\nsort of welcome mingled with a desire to make friends with a human being\r\nso different from themselves. Although I gave them to understand, or\r\ntried to do so, by imitating the ducking motion of their heads, followed\r\nby an attempt to equal their performance in making a large number of\r\nvery low bows, so graceful and easy that they would have done credit to\r\na French dancing master, that they had nothing to fear, yet they\r\ncontinued to back away from me as fast as I advanced. Bulger was\r\nsomewhat surprised at my eagerness to make friends with such a\r\nstarved-out looking set of creatures and kept up a furious growling,\r\neying them suspiciously as they continued the walkingbeam motion of\r\ntheir bodies all the while backing away from me.\r\n\r\nI now found myself in front of a group of umbrella shaped bamboo huts\r\ninto which most of them had retreated. With no little difficulty was it\r\nthat I finally succeeded in coaxing them forth and convincing them that\r\nmy intentions were perfectly peaceful. For a quarter of an hour or more,\r\nthey circled about me in silent wonder, while I, on my part, gazed in\r\nspeechless astonishment at these extraordinary looking specimens of our\r\nrace. What they thought of me, you will learn as my story goes on, but\r\nhow shall I ever describe them to you so as to give you even a faint\r\nidea of their wonderful appearance.\r\n\r\nImagine skeletons of rather small stature walking about, with collapsed\r\nmeal bags hung upon them, skin hanging down in folds everywhere,\r\nflapping about at every step and you’ll have some faint conception of\r\nthe utterly ridiculous and grotesque look of these beings.\r\n\r\nAlmost every bone in their bodies was visible beneath this thin\r\ncovering. Their cheeks hung like two empty pouches on each side of their\r\nfaces, their noses stuck out like knife-blades. Deep wrinkles and\r\ncreases crossed and criss-crossed their faces, giving them a look of\r\nterrible melancholy and utter wretchedness.\r\n\r\nWith their skeleton fingers ever and anon they grasped a fold of skin\r\nand smoothed it out or pushed it elsewhere as one might a loosely\r\nfitting garment. And yet, utterly wretched and melancholy as these\r\ncreatures seemed to be to the eye of the looker-on, their voices were\r\nlight and gay, and soft as flute notes. They chatted and laughed among\r\nthemselves, were full of mischief and pointed their pencil fingers at\r\ndifferent parts of Bulger’s and my body with evident enjoyment at the\r\nsight of things so new and strange to them. Several times while gazing\r\nupon these mournful and woebegone looking faces and at the same time\r\nlistening to their happy and childlike chatter, I broke out into a peal\r\nof laughter which was not only very ill-bred, but which invariably had\r\nthe effect of causing them to fall back in disorder.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, they grew bolder, and by means of a kind of sign\r\nlanguage, gave me to understand that they desired to touch me. By\r\nrecourse to the same common language of mankind, I informed them that I\r\nshould be only too happy to gratify their requests and proceeded to lay\r\nbare my breast and roll up the sleeves of my coat. They half repented of\r\ntheir foolhardiness, and crowding together, interlocked their arms and\r\nlegs in such a manner that, to save my life, I couldn’t tell where one\r\ncommenced and the other ended.\r\n\r\nBut after a few moment’s coaxing, I succeeded in persuading them to\r\nadvance and lay their hands upon me.\r\n\r\nLoud outcries followed exclamations of wonder and astonishment. As I\r\nafterwards learned the words they uttered meant: “Lump!” “Chunk!”\r\n“Stone!” “Hard!” “Solid!” At this moment, feeling a little bit hungry, I\r\nopened my sack of dried fruit and thrust several pieces into my mouth.\r\n\r\nAnd now came a still more furious outburst of wonder, mingled with cries\r\nof horror and disgust. Again they retreated and tied themselves into a\r\nknot.\r\n\r\nCan it be, I asked myself, that these creatures never touch solid food?\r\n\r\nObserving now that they were consulting among themselves as to what\r\ncourse to pursue in regard to me, and being afraid that they might take\r\nit into their heads to escape into the thicket, for they were as quick\r\nin their movements as sprites and phantoms, I lost no time in making\r\nthem understand that I desired to be led into the presence of their King\r\nor ruler.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to please them. But with many duckings of their heads, they\r\nwithdrew a short distance, and held a sort of pow-wow. After which, one\r\nof their number, who seemed to be a sort of leader among them, and whose\r\nname, as I afterwards learned, was Go-Whizz, advanced toward me with\r\nnumerous low-bendings of his body, and succeeded in informing me that\r\ntheir chief lived at a great distance from where we were, and that it\r\nwould be necessary for me to remain here while they returned to their\r\nruler to ask his permission to conduct me to him.\r\n\r\nI readily consented to such an arrangement.\r\n\r\nGo-Whizz then led me to one of their dwellings, pointed out a bed of\r\nnice dry rushes, and invited me to make myself comfortable until he\r\nshould come again to conduct me into the presence of their chief,\r\nZtwish-Ztwish, as was the name he bore.\r\n\r\nBulger and I didn’t wait for a second bidding, for we were tired to the\r\nbone after our long tramp. With half a dozen or more bows, quite as low\r\nas those made by Go-Whizz and his companions, I began to make ready for\r\na night’s rest.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or so, I stood watching the retreating figures of these\r\nextraordinary people who, in single file, swiftly and noiselessly, like\r\nso many phantoms, had flitted away from the spot. Then throwing myself\r\ndown on the bed of rushes, called out to Bulger to lie down by me. But\r\nhe was not so trustful as I, and after caressing my hands, took up his\r\nposition at the door of the dwelling, so as to save his little master\r\nfrom any treachery on the part of the phantom people.\r\n\r\nDay now went out suddenly, like a lamp quenched by the wind.\r\n\r\nBulger refused to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut I, sheltered from the night dews by this thickly-thatched roof, soon\r\nfell into a deep and refreshing sleep, out of which Bulger found it\r\ndifficult to arouse me, for I have a faint recollection of having felt\r\nhim scratching at my arm for several moments, ere I could shake off the\r\nfetters of sleep, which held me bound so tightly.\r\n\r\nSitting up hastily, I discovered that Bulger was patrolling the floor in\r\na state of great excitement, pausing ever and anon to sniff the morning\r\nair, which, it was plain to be seen, brought him a warning of some kind.\r\nInstantly it occurred to me that wild beasts were prowling about in the\r\nneighborhood. I examined the priming of my fire-arms. Bulger looked well\r\npleased to see that I was thoroughly aroused as to the threatening\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nHe now grew bolder, and springing out into the open air, made a circuit\r\nof the dwelling, only to return with bristling hair, and growling out\r\nhis suspicion that all was not right.\r\n\r\nHis ever-increasing anxiety now began to cause me genuine alarm. I was\r\nupon the very point of making a hasty retreat to my vessel, when the\r\nthought flashed through my mind: “What! escape these swift-footed\r\nphantoms? It were idle to attempt it!” So I determined to take my\r\nchances, come what might.\r\n\r\nThe hut was strongly built and its roof would at least protect us from a\r\nflight of poisoned arrow’s.\r\n\r\nWhile I was occupied in making a hasty survey of the place, a loud\r\noutcry from Bulger startled me. I gave one look and a shiver of fear\r\nzigzagged through my body.\r\n\r\nAn armed band was full in sight.\r\n\r\nWith fierce shouts, deep and rumbling, they came nearer and nearer.\r\nTheir massive forms swayed from side to side. Their huge limbs, moved\r\nlike walking oaks. Their arms seemed the sturdy branches ending in hands\r\nwhich, in the dim morning light, took the shape of gnarled and knotted\r\nknobs; terrific strength was shadowed forth by their broad and heavy\r\nshoulders. One blow from a hand of such sledge hammer weight would lay a\r\nfrail creature like me helpless in the dust!\r\n\r\nBulger, brave as he was, quailed at the sight. In an instant I collected\r\nmy thoughts and breathed a last goodbye to the elder baron and to the\r\ngentle baroness, my mother, in their far-away home beneath the northern\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nNow they had reached the very doorway, and stood beating their huge\r\nchests and giving forth deep rumbling sounds.\r\n\r\nInstinctively I unsheathed my poniard and brandished it in the air.\r\n\r\nThe effect was astounding!\r\n\r\nWith terrific cries, groans and shouts they fell back in the wildest\r\nterror, rolling over each other, bounding asunder like gigantic\r\nfootballs, striking the earth and bounding into an erect position.\r\n\r\nWhen at last these human air-bags settled down into something like rest,\r\none of their number broke out into the most plaintive and beseeching\r\nspeech which, I afterwards learned, had about the following meaning: “O,\r\nMaster: O, Magician! O, Mysterious Lump! O, Impenetrable Chunk! put away\r\nthat dread instrument! Prick us not with its awful point, pierce not our\r\ndelicate skins. The slightest touch from that frightful blade would\r\ncause our bodies to burst like pricked balloons! Fear us not. We are thy\r\nfriends. We come to conduct thee to our great chief, Ztwish-Ztwish. I am\r\nGo-Whizz, thy slave.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the truth broke in upon my wondering mind. There was no\r\nfalsehood in the speaker’s words. It was Go-Whizz! The others were his\r\ncompanions—the wretched woebegone bags of bones who had parted with me\r\nonly the day before.\r\n\r\nWith a smile and gentle wave of the hand, I hastily returned my dagger\r\nto its sheath and gave Go-Whizz to understand that he had nothing to\r\nfear from me. Half crazed with curiosity I now advanced to take a closer\r\nlook at Go-Whizz and his companions. Sober fact is it when I tell you\r\nthat they were, man for man, the self same beings I first fell in with\r\non my starting out to explore the island.\r\n\r\nBut this wonderful change you ask? How had they in one short night grown\r\nto such herculean build—arms and limbs as massive as those of Japanese\r\nwrestlers.\r\n\r\nI reply it was all air! When I first met these gentlemen they had not\r\ndined. Now they had just come from a hearty meal. For, you must know\r\nthat I was now in the land of the wonderful Wind Eaters! When the air is\r\ncalm and the winds asleep, these curious people are obliged to fast,\r\nand, their skins hang in wrinkled bags as I have described; but when the\r\nwind starts up for a mad frolic or even a gentle puff and blow, these\r\nstrange creatures at once begin to increase in size, and not long is it\r\nbefore every wrinkle and crease disappear like magic.\r\n\r\nAs Go-Whizz and his companion stood before me, I was struck by the\r\nridiculous contrast between their voices and the expression of their\r\nfaces. Yesterday, with their fierce and forbidding faces their voices\r\nwere soft and flute-like; to-day, their voices were terrible, deep and\r\nrumbling, while their faces now puffed out smooth and round seemed\r\nwreathed in smiles and good humor.\r\n\r\nAs I stood lost in wonder at the sight of these strangely-transformed\r\nbeings, Go-Whizz rumbled out something which I easily understood to be a\r\nrequest that I should permit him to conduct me to the residence of his\r\ngreat chief, Ztwish-Ztwish.\r\n\r\nI smiled assent and set about gathering up my traps.\r\n\r\nBulger was completely nonplussed and fixed his lustrous eyes upon me as\r\nmuch as to say:\r\n\r\n“Dear little master, how canst thou trust thyself to these huge\r\nmountains of flesh, a single one of whom could crush thy frail body as\r\neasily as I would a mouse?”\r\n\r\nI gave him a few caresses and stroked his silken coat, to let him know I\r\nwas sure that I was right. Go-Whizz and his band, clumsy as they seemed,\r\nwere by no means slow of pace. They moved forward at a brisk rate for\r\nthe air was calm and they had little to carry. Now and then, upon\r\nbumping together, they bounded apart like rubber balls. It was a\r\ndifficult thing for me to keep from laughing, especially when I saw\r\nBulger’s look of utter perplexity. He rolled his eyes up at me in the\r\nmost comical manner. However, at last we entered the village of the Wind\r\nEaters, where the great chief, Ztwish-Ztwish held his court.\r\n\r\nHe too was puffed out pretty round, although, as I afterwards learned,\r\nthe laws of the land did not allow him to eat as heartily as his\r\nsubjects. Here and there a wrinkle was visible. His face and arms didn’t\r\nhave that look of puffy tightness common to his people after a hearty\r\nmeal. He had already been fully informed of my arrival on his island,\r\nand of my extraordinary weight and hardness for my size.\r\n\r\nIt took about fifteen of the Wind Eaters to balance me in the scales.\r\n\r\nChief Ztwish-Ztwish received Bulger and me with the greatest kindness. I\r\nwas at once presented to his ministers of state and to the members of\r\nhis family. Queen Phew-yoo was a very stately dame, dignified and\r\nreserved in her manners; but the little princess Pouf-fâh charmed me\r\nwith her childlike curiosity.\r\n\r\nTheir excellencies, the ministers of state, stood behind their master\r\nand seemed intent upon giving him far more advice than he was willing to\r\nlisten to. Their names were Hiss-sah, Whirr-Whirr and Sh-Boom.\r\n\r\nYou may well imagine the excitement created in the home of chief\r\nZtwish-Ztwish by my arrival. From the highest to the lowest, from chief\r\nto serving-man, everyone begged and implored to be allowed to feel of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnxious to make a favorable impression upon the strange people so that I\r\nmight have a good opportunity to study them at my ease, I submitted\r\ngood-naturedly for an hour or more, to being patted, pinched, prodded,\r\nrubbed, and stroked.\r\n\r\nIt were vain for me to attempt to give you any idea of the thousand and\r\none outcries of surprise, delight, wonder, fear, anxiety, and dread\r\nwhich went up from this multitude of strange beings, who were, although\r\nthey didn’t seem to think so, quite as great curiosities to me as I to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMy stock of dried fruit was now quite exhausted and I began to feel the\r\ngnawings of hunger.\r\n\r\nI was always blest with a splendid appetite and the pure bracing air of\r\nthis island only added to it. Bulger, too, I could see, was casting\r\ninquiring glances about in search of some signs of kitchen arrangements.\r\nI made known to chief Ztwish-Ztwish, as well as I could, the state of\r\naffairs, and he at once summoned Hiss-sah, Whirr-Whirr and Sh-Boom to\r\nhis side for a consultation.\r\n\r\nThey held a most animated discussion and one too, which ran from quarter\r\nhour to quarter hour without any sign of coming to an end.\r\n\r\nAll this time my poor stomach was wondering what had cut off the\r\ncustomary supplies.\r\n\r\nLike rulers the world over, chief Ztwish-Ztwish was impatient and\r\nself-willed. Finally he lost his temper completely and moved about so\r\nvigorously that his three ministers were kept continually on the bounce,\r\nso to speak.\r\n\r\nIf you can only wait long enough every thing comes to an end. I was\r\nfinally bidden to approach the chief, who asked me whether I had, since\r\nmy arrival on his island, seen anything which I could eat?\r\n\r\nI was obliged to confess that I had not. Whereupon there was another\r\nconsultation, which ended in Ztwish-Ztwish seizing his corkwood club and\r\nsending each one of his ministers in a different direction, with three\r\nquick smart blows. The sight was so ludicrous that I would willingly\r\nhave let my dinner go for a chance at the bat myself.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an idea came to me. I could see that this settlement of the\r\nWind Eaters was not far from the seashore. So, as best I could, I made\r\nchief Ztwish-Ztwish comprehend that I could eat the oysters and other\r\nshell fish, of which I had noticed vast quantities lying on the white\r\nsands of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen the thing was made thoroughly plain to them that I proposed to\r\nsatisfy my hunger by devouring such horrid and disgusting creatures as\r\nlived between these shells, I was really alarmed at the consternation it\r\ncaused.\r\n\r\nQueen Phew-yoo and princess Pouf-fâh were taken ill and withdrew to\r\ntheir apartments in great haste, while one and all, even including the\r\nfierce Go-Whizz, were seized with symptoms of nausea. By degrees,\r\nhowever, they recovered and orders were issued to half a dozen\r\nserving-men who, not being gorged, were in good marching condition to\r\nset out for the shore, and bring a supply of the shell-fish to appease\r\nmy hunger, which, by this time had really set its teeth in my vitals.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bulger and I were conducted to a neat bamboo dwelling with an\r\numbrella-shaped roof, and left to ourselves until the supply of food\r\nshould arrive.\r\n\r\nI was too hungry to sleep. And, Bulger, too, was in the same condition.\r\nBut he was patience itself, as he always is, when he knows that his\r\nlittle master is suffering.\r\n\r\nI threw myself down on a heap of dried rushes and my loving companion\r\ncame and pillowed his head on my arm.\r\n\r\nAfter a tedious wait of an hour or so a great outcry told me that\r\nsomething unusual had happened in the village of the Wind Eaters.\r\n\r\nIt was the arrival of the serving-men bringing the supply of oysters.\r\n\r\nI could hardly restrain myself until chief Ztwish-Ztwish should summon\r\nme to break my long fast.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the chief’s quarters I found a vast crowd of people\r\nassembled to see the “Lump Man” put solid things down his throat.\r\n\r\nChief Ztwish-Ztwish and his court occupied front seats.\r\n\r\nAs you know by this time the voice of a Wind Eater depends upon the\r\ncondition he is in. If he has just eaten and his body is rounded out\r\nlike a well-filled balloon, his voice is deep and rumbling; if, on the\r\nother hand, he has not taken food for a day or so and his skin hangs in\r\nfolds and wrinkles on his framework of bones, he speaks with a soft,\r\nflute-like tone.\r\n\r\nAs I stepped to the front, followed by Bulger, and took my place beside\r\nthe heap of oysters, a deafening outcry went up, in which the deep roars\r\nof the inflated Wind Eaters were mingled with the soft flute-like tones\r\nof the fasting ones. Not noticing any instrument at hand with which to\r\npry the shells open I thoughtlessly drew my poniard from its sheath. In\r\nan instant a terrible panic seized upon the assembled multitude. Queen\r\nPhew-yoo and princess Pouf-fâh fell into a swoon. Chief Ztwish-Ztwish\r\nbeing in a fasting condition darted away to his apartments like a\r\nphantom. The ministers of state, Iliss-sah, Whirr-Whirr and Sh-Boom,\r\nbeing puffed up to their fullest capacity, struck the ground with their\r\nfeet and rolled out of the way like huge footballs.\r\n\r\nQuick as thought I sheathed my dagger, the sight of whose glittering\r\npoint had brought about all this consternation; and, profiting by the\r\nlessons given me at our first meeting by Go-Whizz and his companions, I\r\nbegan a series of head-duckings and walkingbeam motions of my body,\r\nwhich soon restored confidence in my peaceful intentions and brought my\r\nscattered audience back to their seats. Go-Whizz, who had run the\r\nfarthest, was now loudest in his boasts that he had not been the least\r\nfrightened. Chief Ztwish-Ztwish resumed his seat with considerable\r\nnerve, but I noticed that he kept his eyes fastened on the place where I\r\nhad hidden my dagger in my belt. Although the sight of the toothsome\r\noysters only served to whet my appetite, yet was I now terribly\r\nperplexed to know how I should pry the shells open, for the laws of the\r\nland of the Wind Eaters visited the death penalty upon any one found\r\nwith a sharp-pointed instrument in his possession.\r\n\r\nIn earliest childhood the finger-nails are kept pared down to the flesh,\r\nuntil they lose their power to grow hard, and their place is taken by a\r\npiece of tough skin.\r\n\r\nTeeth—the Wind Eaters have none; or, more correctly speaking, their\r\nteeth do not grow above their gums. Nature seemed to have gradually\r\nceased taking the trouble to supply these people with something for\r\nwhich they had absolutely no use.\r\n\r\nYou must bear in mind that these curious people had not always been\r\nsatisfied with such thin diet. In ancient times—so chief Ztwish-Ztwish\r\ninformed me, their ancestors had been fruit-eaters; the fruits, however,\r\nfailing, they had been forced to have recourse to the gums which flowed\r\nfrom the trees, and as these gradually dried up, they made discovery\r\nthat the various winds which blew across the island were filled with\r\nsome invisible germs or particles, which had the power of sustaining\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nTo resume: Observing a flint hatchet lying on the ground, I laid hold of\r\nit and set to work opening one of the largest oysters. A deep silence\r\nsettled upon the assemblage. With a skilful twist, I wrenched the upper\r\nshell off, and, raising the lower one, upon which the fat and luscious\r\ncreature lay unmindful of his impending fate, I opened my mouth and\r\ngracefully let the dainty morsel slip out of sight! A hundred cries of\r\nhalf horror, half wonder broke like a great chorus from the surrounding\r\ncrowds of Wind Eaters. Again and again this outburst died away, only to\r\nbreak forth once more with redoubled vigor.\r\n\r\nMany of the lookers-on were made so seriously ill by this—to them—most\r\nextraordinary spectacle, that they hastily left the place before I was\r\nable to take a second mouthful.\r\n\r\nYou may fancy how they felt. About as you would were I to begin gulping\r\ndown bits of stone and iron.\r\n\r\nQueen Phew-yoo clung timorously to her husband’s arm; but the princess\r\nPouf-fâh stepped boldly nearer to me, so that she might have a better\r\nview of the “little man solid all through.” Again I raised one of the\r\nlargest shells and let its occupant slip noiselessly down my throat, not\r\nforgetting each time to loosen the white muscle which held the shells\r\ntogether for Bulger’s share of the feast.\r\n\r\nGradually the qualms of the Wind Eaters, at sight of a human being\r\nswallowing food in lumps, gave place to a devouring curiosity on their\r\npart to draw nearer and get a better view of my manner of satisfying\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nI could understand enough to know that many of the Wind Eaters had\r\nserious doubts that I really swallowed the oysters.\r\n\r\nTo them, I was little less than some sort of a sleight-of-hand man or\r\ndoer of tricks.\r\n\r\nThe little princess Pouf-fâh mounted upon one of the benches, and the\r\ninstant the oyster disappeared down my throat insisted upon my opening\r\nmy mouth to its greatest width, in order that she might take a look for\r\nherself and see if the oyster were not hidden away under my tongue or in\r\nmy cheek somewhere.\r\n\r\nA sudden scream of terror startled the lookers-on as much as it did me.\r\n\r\nThe little princess was carried away in a swoon.\r\n\r\nIt was my teeth! They had frightened the gentle Pouf-fâh half to death.\r\n\r\nFor a moment all was confusion. Encouraged by Go-Whizz, many of the Wind\r\nEaters seized their clubs and pressed forward with murderous intent. The\r\nreappearance of princess Pouf-fâh, bright and smiling, set everything\r\nright again.\r\n\r\nNow the crowd was seized with unconquerable curiosity to draw near and\r\ntake a look for themselves at the terrible thing which had thrown\r\nPouf-fâh into a swoon.\r\n\r\nMy jaws soon began to ache from stretching my mouth wide enough open to\r\ngive each one of them a glance at my double row of ivory cutters and\r\ngrinders, and if I do say it myself, I had in those days one of the\r\nfinest sets of teeth that ever cut their way through a slice of Nienburg\r\nbiscuit, or ground up a piece of German roast goose.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, these childlike and simple-minded people became pretty\r\nthoroughly convinced that the “Little Man Thick All Through” was a kind\r\nand peaceful creature and every way perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\nThe children flocked about me, and encouraged by my smiles and\r\nhead-duckings soon made friends with me.\r\n\r\nI was glad of this, for I was anxious to make a close study of the Wind\r\nEaters young and old.\r\n\r\nYou may judge of my surprise when I saw a bevy of these\r\nchildren—animated puff-balls that they were—engaged in the to them,\r\nnovel sport of rushing full tilt at me and bouncing off like rubber\r\nballs from a board fence.\r\n\r\nWell, I suppose you are bursting with curiosity to hear something more\r\ndefinite about these strange people.\r\n\r\nTo me they were not entirely unknown. I had read here and there ancient\r\nbooks of travel by Arabian authors, of some such a race; whose bodies\r\nwere so frail that they were unable to partake of any stronger and\r\nheavier food than the sweet gums which flowed from the trees and whose\r\nskins were so transparent that they were called “glass-bodied,” the\r\nbeating of their little hearts being plainly visible to the eye of the\r\nbeholder. I have no doubt that these authors referred to the dwellers of\r\nthis wonderful island, on which no fruits, berries or edible roots were\r\nto be found, and whose ancestors, as I was informed by chief\r\nZtwish-Ztwish, did, in former ages, thus sustain their lives. But I must\r\nconfess that the fact that there were in existence human beings who\r\nliterally lived upon air; or, more correctly speaking, upon winds laden\r\nwith some invisible particles of life-sustaining matter, was a little\r\nmore than I had ever dared to dream out, even in the most active\r\nworkings of my imagination. You may judge then of my delight upon\r\nfinding myself among these extraordinary people, and upon discovering\r\nthem to be such true children of nature, mild-mannered and\r\npeacefully-inclined.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I was not long in making a discovery which proved to be quite an\r\nimportant one to me.\r\n\r\nIt was this. I learned that although the truth was as I have stated it,\r\nthat the Wind Eaters are as a rule, a race of peace-loving creatures,\r\ngentle in their dispositions and averse to wrong-doing, yet there were\r\nexceptions to this general rule. Strange to say, it depended on what\r\nwind they fed upon.\r\n\r\nAll the women, for instance, were gentleness itself. They fed upon the\r\nsoft zephyrs of the south. But the great majority of these people\r\ncontented themselves with satisfying their hunger by resorting to the\r\nstrong and wholesome west wind; while a goodly number, from some idea\r\nthat it had a sweeter and more delicate flavor, a sort of heavy,\r\nnut-like taste, preferred the fitful, irregular east wind. It was\r\nhowever not considered wholesome diet by the best physicians of the\r\nnation and they contended that those who made a habit of feeding upon\r\nthis wind were never as hale and hearty as those who restricted\r\nthemselves entirely to the nutritious and bracing west wind.\r\n\r\nA few there were—as in every land there are those who delight in strong,\r\nrich food, who insisted upon feeding on the rugged, gusty north-west\r\nwind, claiming that it was best suited to their wants, and that nature\r\nhad intended man to partake of a wind powerful and strong-bodied, in\r\norder to fit them for the battle of life. There were even some—a very\r\nfew, be it said to the honor of these mild-mannered and peace-loving\r\npeople, who, contrary to the laws of the land and the express commands\r\nof chief Ztwish-Ztwish, welcomed the blowing of the angry whistling,\r\nboisterous north-wind, and drank in the dangerous fluid until their\r\nbetter natures were completely changed; and from being gentle, timorous\r\nand peace-loving, they became rough, and quarrelsome.\r\n\r\nTo this ilk belonged Captain Go-Whizz. In fact, as I was told by\r\nWhirr-Whirr, chief Ztwish-Ztwish himself showed signs of fear when he\r\nsaw Go-Whizz come swaggering into the village, his eyes inflamed, his\r\nsteps unsteady, his speech indistinct after a heavy meal upon the rude\r\nand buffeting wind of the north. While in this condition Go-Whizz lost\r\nthe slight control he had over himself and had, upon one occasion, so\r\nfar forgotten himself as to breathe out threats and defiance against\r\nchief Ztwish-Ztwish, driving that ruler out of his own apartments, by\r\nadvancing upon him with a bit of flint which he had ground to a\r\ndangerously sharp point.\r\n\r\nSuch were the curious people among whom I now found myself sojourning\r\nand on terms of pleasant intimacy with their ruler.\r\n\r\nA few days after my arrival at the village of the Wind Eaters, I was,\r\nunfortunately the innocent cause of rather a grave accident, which, for\r\na while had the effect of making me somewhat unpopular at the court of\r\nchief Ztwish-Ztwish.\r\n\r\nIt all came about in this way:\r\n\r\nI’ve already told you how quick the children were to discover the\r\nsolidity of my body and what delight they took in throwing themselves\r\nagainst me full tilt, in order to have the sport of bouncing off again\r\nlike so many rubber balls.\r\n\r\nNow you must keep in mind the fact that even after a hearty meal, a\r\nwhole dozen of these babies weighed about one good pound.\r\n\r\nI used to encourage them to play about me, in order the better to\r\nobserve their curious tricks and ways, one of which was to lock arms and\r\nlegs and thus form a chain of human links, one of which being fastened\r\nto a peak of the roof and the other possibly to some high staff or pole,\r\nat times even extending across the street and ending on the roof of the\r\nopposite dwelling. Thus festooned they spent hours swaying to and fro in\r\nthe cool of the day, often swinging themselves to sleep. And it was not\r\nat all an unusual thing to see one of the mothers in search of her child\r\ncome bustling along, halt, take down the line of living links, unhook\r\nher baby, replace the line and hurry away home.\r\n\r\nWhile seated, one day, on the balcony of one of chief Ztwish-Ztwish’s\r\ncottages, a dozen or more of the children set to work to form such a\r\nchain, one end of it being fastened to one of my earrings which, like a\r\ngood sailor, I took pleasure in wearing at times, and the other reaching\r\nnearly to the ground, passing over the high rail of the balcony.\r\n\r\nScrambling, pushing and squirming, uttering the queerest cries, shouts\r\nand squeals, these tiny Wind Eaters were half wild with joy, when\r\nsuddenly one of those nearest me swung against the point of a needle\r\nwhich I had, doubtlessly, thrust into the lapel of my coat the last time\r\nI had been doing some mending, for, like a true sailor, I was skilled in\r\nthe use of needle and thread.\r\n\r\nI was aroused from my dreamy contemplation of these fantastic beings by\r\na sharp crack like that made by the bursting of a toy balloon.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the same sharp noise rang in my ear.\r\n\r\nA glance was sufficient to explain it all. I could feel my hair\r\nbristling up with horror as I saw the living links of this chain snap\r\nasunder, one after the other, and disappear into thin air. Exploded by\r\ncoming into contact with the needle point, the force of the explosion of\r\nthe first of these tiny puff-balls of humanity had been sufficient to\r\nburst the baby next in the line and so on to the end of the chain!\r\n\r\nA dozen of them gone in less than as many seconds and not so much as a\r\nlock of hair to carry home to the heart broken mothers!\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, the news of the accident had spread to every quarter\r\nof the village. The weeping, shrieking mothers, howling for vengeance,\r\ngathered quickly about the dwelling into the interior of which Bulger\r\nand I had retreated.\r\n\r\nNow you may believe me when I say, that I would not have stood in the\r\nleast dread of an army of the Wind Eaters, when they were fully inflated\r\nafter a hearty meal, but it so happened that the air had been calm for a\r\nday or so, and that many of them were now shrunken to the living\r\nskeleton size in which I had first met them. In this condition they were\r\nfoes not to be despised, for, moving as they did, with almost lightning\r\nrapidity, their mode of fighting was to entangle their enemy in fine\r\nnets, woven of bamboo fibre and then beat them to death with their\r\nclubs.\r\n\r\nTrue, these clubs were made of corkwood, and a score of them weighed\r\nless than a pound; yet, this fact would only make death slower and more\r\npainful; for, while a few blows might suffice to put one of their own\r\nkind out of his misery, it would, most surely, have required a whole day\r\nfor them to beat the life out of such a solid enemy as I was.\r\n\r\nBefore I had chance to collect my thoughts, Go-Whizz was at the door\r\nwith his band, their nets coiled to throw over me, while behind the\r\nnet-throwers stood a row of club-bearers, anxiously awaiting their turn\r\nto begin proceedings. Thought I to myself: “This is serious business. If\r\nchief Ztwish-Ztwish is not at hand, they will entangle me in their nets\r\nand try to beat the life out of me before he returns, for they well know\r\nhis affection for me.” But, worse than all, was the fact that Go-Whizz\r\nhad just returned from a distant part of the island, whither he and a\r\nfew of his chums had made a secret journey, in order to gorge themselves\r\non the rude and boisterous north-west wind. He was full of swagger and\r\nire! I had never seen him swollen to such a size. His voice sounded like\r\nthe deep bellowing of some fierce animal.\r\n\r\nHe whirled his net in the air, and called out in thundering tones for\r\nhis men to follow him.\r\n\r\nI felt now that the moment had arrived for me to make a desperate effort\r\nto save my life and Bulger’s, too, for, with his four feet twisted up in\r\none of their nets, he would fall an easy prey to Go-Whizz and his band.\r\nI felt, too, that it would be worse than useless to appeal to Go-Whizz\r\nfor mercy, influenced, as he was, by long and deep draughts of the\r\nfierce and raging north-west gale.\r\n\r\nThere he stood, puffing, blowing, blustering, swaggering, as round and\r\nround his head he swung the fatal web, which, the moment I should\r\nattempt to take my back from the wall, he intended to cast over me as a\r\nfowler would entrap a bird.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I bethought myself of the little instrument which had brought\r\nme to this dangerous strait.\r\n\r\nBefore drawing it, however, from its hiding-place, I determined to play\r\nthe bully and swagger a little myself.\r\n\r\nNow, the heaviest Wind Eater weighs about six pounds; and, as you may\r\nimagine, my weight, nearly a hundred pounds, was a source of great dread\r\nto them. They stood in constant fear that I might accidentally tread\r\nupon one of the toes of a Wind Eater and explode him.\r\n\r\nBefore they would allow me to venture out upon one of their balconies,\r\nor to inhabit an upper story of one of their dwellings, they proceeded\r\nto strengthen it with the stoutest bamboo poles they could find. So, I\r\nnow began to give the valiant Go-Whizz a few gentle reminders of my\r\nweight and solidity.\r\n\r\nLeaping high into the air, I landed upon the bamboo flooring with such a\r\nthump that everything creaked and trembled.\r\n\r\nAt first there was a general stampede of Go-Whizz’s followers, and that\r\nblustering leader was the only one left to face Bulger and me.\r\n\r\nHe stood his ground pretty bravely, although I could see that he was\r\nhalf inclined to heed the cries of his men and make his way out of the\r\ndwelling before I succeeded in wrecking it. But, after a few more of my\r\njumps, seeing that the flooring withstood all my efforts to break it\r\ndown, Go-Whizz succeeded in rallying his band.\r\n\r\nAgain, and now more furious than ever, they surrounded us, shrieking and\r\nhowling like mad, their uplifted right hands bearing the dangerous nets,\r\nwith which they hoped to entangle Bulger and me, and then dispatch us.\r\n\r\nNow, it was high time for me to fall back on my reserves.\r\n\r\nI did so. The effect was simply astounding. The needle proved to be one\r\nof the kind used for darning; very long and bright, and exceedingly\r\nsharp-pointed. My dagger point was bad enough. It had thrown them into a\r\nwild and panicky fear. But, this little instrument, as I brandished it\r\nin front of them, threw them into fits of rigid terror.\r\n\r\nThey stood rooted to the ground, their bulging eyes riveted upon the\r\nneedle-point as if they, one and all, expected it to prick them to death\r\nif they stirred an inch.\r\n\r\nAt last, making a mighty effort, Go-Whizz broke away from the spot,\r\nuttering a deep and rumbling cry of horror, his men rolling after him,\r\nin the wildest terror. When they saw the tumultuous manner in which the\r\nvaliant Go-Whizz and his followers retreated from my presence, the\r\nassembled men and women, with frightful cries, took to their heels as if\r\na legion of demons were pursuing them.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Bulger and I stood alone on the battle field. He had\r\nnot budged from my side during the time that death threatened me.\r\n\r\n“Come!” said I, as I stooped and stroked his head. “Come, thou faithful\r\nfriend and companion, let us go to chief Ztwish-Ztwish and lay the\r\nmatter before him!”\r\n\r\nThe chief had just awoke from a noonday nap. He had calmly slept through\r\nthe whole conflict, and so it was necessary for me to give him a full\r\naccount of the unfortunate accident which resulted in exploding an\r\nentire string of babies, and of Go-Whizz’s attempt to slay me. He\r\nlistened with great calmness and most patiently too. He then begged to\r\nbe excused for a few moments as an attendant had just informed him that\r\na very soft and sweet south wind had begun to blow.\r\n\r\nHe stepped out on the balcony; and after he had taken about a dozen\r\nmouthfuls of the pure, refreshing breeze, returned looking a little\r\nplumper and, like all men after enjoying a meal of favorite food, was\r\nstill more amiable and kindly in his manner than before.\r\n\r\nThe news that a dozen of the smallest subjects had been so\r\nunceremoniously popped out of existence didn’t seem to worry him very\r\nmuch. What moved him most of all, was the fact which, apparently, up to\r\nthat hour had never entered into his mind, namely, that a point so fine,\r\nso delicate, so deadly, so nearly invisible, could be created by the\r\nhand of man!\r\n\r\nI assured him that it was that very moment hidden in the stuff of my\r\ngarb, right in front of his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe trembled.\r\n\r\nI strove to reassure him, by explaining to him that I would as soon\r\nthink of plunging my poniard into my own heart as of turning this almost\r\ninvisible and yet deadly point against his life.\r\n\r\nHe tried to smile, but it ended in a shudder.\r\n\r\n“Thinkest thou, little man thick-all-through,” asked chief Ztwish-Ztwish\r\nwith a trembling tongue, “that I may look upon it and not fall into a\r\nswoon?”\r\n\r\n“O, most assuredly, great chief:” was my reply. “In fact, most light and\r\nbuoyant Ztwish-Ztwish,” I continued, “I can rob this dreaded instrument\r\nof all its power to injure thee and place it in thy hand like any\r\nharmless bit of wood. Is it thy will that I should thus deliver to thee\r\nthis dreaded point?”\r\n\r\nWith a slight shiver, chief Ztwish-Ztwish made answer:\r\n\r\n“Ay, great and learned little master, I think I can bear the sight of it\r\nnow. I am, indeed, very brave, but thou knowest a single prick of that\r\ndeadly point would instantly end the life of the sturdiest Wind Eater.”\r\n\r\nI again assured him that there was really nothing to dread so long as he\r\nfollowed my directions. So saying I drew the darning needle from its\r\nhiding place.\r\n\r\nChief Ztwish-Ztwish closed his eyes at first, but gradually grew bold\r\nenough to gaze upon the glittering point.\r\n\r\nStooping down I picked up one of the cork clubs and breaking off a bit\r\nof the smaller end thrust the needle point into it.\r\n\r\nChief Ztwish-Ztwish watched my movements with a sort of painful\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n“There, great chief of the Wind Eaters,” I exclaimed, “now thou mayest\r\ntoy with it, hide it in the rushes of thy bed, it cannot injure thee! It\r\nis as harmless as a pebble rounded by the sportive, sparkling waters of\r\none of thy mountain brooks. Take it! it may serve thee some day, in case\r\nof a sudden attack upon thy illustrious person.”\r\n\r\n“At such a moment, fear naught! seize it firmly, draw its dreaded point\r\nfrom its hiding place in this bit of cork. So small is it that it will\r\nbe invisible in thy hand, and while thine enemy stands before thee in\r\nfancied safety, pierce him to death; for, thou are ruler and it is\r\nfitting that death should strike him who attempts to rob thy people of\r\ntheir chief!”\r\n\r\nChief Ztwish-Ztwish took the needle with trembling hand, and hid the bit\r\nof cork which held it under the thatch of the roof. Then, calling out,\r\nhe summoned one of his serving-men and bade him bring from a neighboring\r\napartment a certain small bamboo chest, from which he drew a string of\r\nrare jewels somewhat of the nature of amber, only a thousand times more\r\nbrilliant. With this beautiful gift he dismissed me, issuing orders to\r\nhis ministers that no harm should be allowed to come to me for the\r\naccident which exploded the string of little Wind Eaters.\r\n\r\nGo-Whizz could with difficulty hide his anger at seeing me once more an\r\nhonored guest at the court of chief Ztwish-Ztwish.\r\n\r\nI did not relax my vigilance in the least, however. Every night I barred\r\nthe windows with my own hands, and placed Bulger’s mat of rushes in\r\nfront of the door, so that it would be impossible for the wrathful\r\nleader to surprise me.\r\n\r\nNow that the explosion of the babies was quite forgotten, my sojourn\r\namong the Wind Eaters would have continued to be extremely pleasant, had\r\nnot a new difficulty arisen to cause me anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe rather thin diet upon which I had been existing, since my arrival\r\namong these curious people, while it appeased my hunger, robbed me of\r\nthat plump and well-fed look which I had always had, I found myself\r\nlosing flesh at an alarming rate. Chief Ztwish-Ztwish and queen Phew-yoo\r\nwere delighted, for as they expressed it, “the little man\r\nthick-all-through was rapidly becoming in appearance at least, a genuine\r\nWind Eater.”\r\n\r\nBulger, too, fell away dreadfully.\r\n\r\nNow and then I surprised him with his dark, lustrous eyes fixed upon me\r\nwith as much as to say: “O, little master, what is the matter with us?\r\nWe eat, and yet we grow thin. Are we really turning to Wind Eaters?”\r\n\r\nAnd another bad phase of the matter was, that while my ever-increasing\r\nleanness was causing me so much anxiety, it was carrying joy to the\r\nheart of queen Phew-yoo who, it seems, had formed the plan of keeping me\r\nfor the rest of my life in the service of her lord and master by\r\nbestowing upon me the hand of the fair princess Pouf-fâh.\r\n\r\nQueen Phew-yoo’s explanation of my ever-increasing thinness was, that it\r\nwas the effect of the wonderful atmosphere of their island; that it\r\nmattered very little how thick and solid a man might be, if he lived\r\nlong enough among them, he would gradually lose it and become, if not a\r\ngenuine Wind Eater, at least almost as light and airy a being as they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nAs I learned of these views from others before hearing them from the\r\nqueen’s own lips, it was not at all a surprise for me, one day to\r\nreceive a message from the stately Phew-yoo summoning me to present\r\nmyself before her.\r\n\r\nShe accorded me a very gracious reception, and princess Pouf-fâh too,\r\nshowed great delight at seeing me under her mother’s roof. She bounced\r\nhither and thither like a toy balloon, now shaking perfume from dried\r\nflowers, now holding up strings of the curious gems, which I have\r\nalready mentioned, and making them glisten in front of my face.\r\n\r\nI amused her by holding her out on the palm of my hand and tossing her\r\nup and catching her, as I would a rubber ball.\r\n\r\nQueen Phew-yoo looked on in mute satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhen Princess Pouf-fâh had grown weary of play, the queen spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“O, little man thick-all-through, I have to say to thee that which will\r\ngladden thy heart. The great chief, my husband, and I have noticed with\r\njoy that day by day thou art growing thinner and thinner. Know then,\r\nthat this is the magical effect of the air thou breathest. When our\r\nforefathers landed on this island, they, like thee were solid all\r\nthrough. Therefore, be not alarmed when, a few months hence, thou\r\nfindest thyself completely changed. Thou wilt, ere long, lose this heavy\r\nload of useless flesh, which thou hast been for so long a time condemned\r\nto carry about with thee, and become light and buoyant, like us. And, O\r\nbeloved Lump, that thou mayest hasten the change from thy present solid\r\nform and become a graceful and hollow being like one of us, I do, with\r\nthe chief Ztwish-Ztwish’s counsel and consent, accord thee permission to\r\neat with us each day. This very hour shalt thou make thy first meal upon\r\nthe sweet and wholesome wind of the South. The very moment, little\r\nChunk, that thou hast become thin enough to suit the great chief, he\r\nwill give thee the fair princess Pouf-fâh for thy wife.”\r\n\r\nAt these words, the princess, who really seemed to be very fond of me,\r\nclapped her hands joyfully, and bounced between her mother and me like a\r\ntoy football.\r\n\r\n“But, little Man-Lump,” continued queen Phew-yoo, “before we set out to\r\ndine on the sweet wind which blows over Banquet Hill, there are two\r\nthings which the great chief Ztwish-Ztwish said I must be very\r\nparticular to mention to you, the two conditions upon which he is\r\nwilling to honor you above all men, by bestowing the hand of the\r\nbeautiful princess Pouf-fâh upon thee.”\r\n\r\n“Name them, gracious queen!” I cried, for I was too wise to raise any\r\nobjections at this point. I knew only too well that a single word from\r\nchief Ztwish-Ztwish would hand me over to the tender mercies of the\r\nfierce Go-Whizz.\r\n\r\n“They are,” resumed queen Phew-yoo, puffing out her cheeks and tapping\r\nthem playfully with the backs of her thumbs, “they are, little man\r\nthick-all-through, that thou shalt file thy teeth down even with thy\r\ngums and keep thy nails always pared down to the flesh.”\r\n\r\n“It shall be, gracious queen, as thou desirest,” I replied, with several\r\nlow bendings of my body.\r\n\r\n“Then,” answered queen Phew-yoo gayly, “there remains nothing for thee\r\nto do but to begin at once to accustom thyself to our food; so let us\r\nset out for Banquet Hill without delay, for the sweet south wind is\r\nblowing fresh and strong!”\r\n\r\nI accompanied queen Phew-yoo and princess Pouf-fâh to the place\r\nindicated. It was a beautiful knoll, from which I could look far away to\r\nsouthward over a valley, enchantingly fair.\r\n\r\nShe and the princess at once began to inhale the soft, sweet air, and\r\nencouraged me to do the same.\r\n\r\nThey were delighted with my efforts. In fact, the motherly Phew-yoo\r\nseemed a little bit anxious lest I should overeat myself.\r\n\r\nAfter the princess had taken a few deep draughts, I was surprised to see\r\nan attendant approach her and place about her throat a necklace of\r\nbeads, strung upon an elastic cord. This was a precaution to prevent the\r\nprincess from eating too heartily, were she so inclined. Well, as you\r\nmay imagine, I returned to my apartments from dining with queen Phew-yoo\r\nand princess Pouf-fâh on Banquet Hill a very hungry man; if that were\r\npossible, hungrier than I was before, for the pure, fresh air and many\r\ndeep breaths had fairly made me ravenous.\r\n\r\nOnce more alone with Bulger, I set to work thinking out some scheme to\r\nget hold of more food; and, by checking my alarming loss of flesh, put\r\nan end to queen Phew-yoo’s plan of transforming me into a genuine Wind\r\nEater and giving me the princess Pouf-fâh for a wife.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that possibly I might catch some fish in one of the\r\narms of the sea nearest to the village and broil it on live embers, for\r\nI had my tinder box in my pocket.\r\n\r\nThis plan worked to a charm. I soon succeeded in teaching several of the\r\nserving-men to rig up a number of their war-nets as a sort of seine, and\r\nwas overjoyed the first time I cast it to make a haul of a dozen or more\r\nfine sea-bass.\r\n\r\nBulger entered into the sport with great zeal, seizing a rope in his\r\nmouth and tugging away for dear life, as we began to haul in.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to gather some dry leaves and wood, and start a\r\nsuitable fire to make a bed of embers. Crowds of the Wind Eaters\r\ngathered about me and watched my movements with a sort of mixture of\r\nwonder, fear and pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the smoke began to curl up, and the flame showed itself,\r\ncries of consternation broke forth, and a wild stampede ensued.\r\n\r\nChief Ztwish-Ztwish was hastily summoned; but, I had no difficulty in\r\nconvincing him that I intended no injury to anyone, that the red tongues\r\nwhich he saw darting forth were perfectly harmless if they did not come\r\nin contact with one’s flesh; that it would only be necessary for him to\r\nissue a command forbidding the people to approach too near to the\r\ntongues of crimson which darted from the black clouds of smoke.\r\n\r\nBy the time the live embers had formed I was ready with a dressed\r\nsea-bass of about two pounds’ weight, and the cooking began.\r\n\r\nIt is needless for me to assure you that Bulger and I sat down to a\r\ndelightful meal, really the first satisfactory one since my arrival\r\namong the Wind Eaters.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on all went well. Every day my oyster gatherers and my\r\nfishermen made their visit to the shore to keep my larder supplied. Upon\r\ntheir return, I was always in readiness with a fine bed of embers. So\r\nthings went on for a week or so. I was delighted to find Bulger and\r\nmyself gaining flesh in splendid style. And still, every now and then I\r\nwas obliged to accept queen Phew-yoo’s invitation to dine with her and\r\nthe princess Pouf-fâh at Banquet Hill, where I pretended to enjoy a meal\r\non the soft and perfumed south wind quite as much as they did\r\nthemselves. Queen Phew-yoo insisted that my complexion was growing\r\nclearer and more transparent every day, and that, beyond all doubt, in a\r\nfew months I would be able entirely to give up a “swallowing stones” as\r\nshe called it.\r\n\r\nWhile I was quietly pursuing my studies of these curious people, another\r\nunfortunate occurrence took place, and this time it turned out to be a\r\nvery grave and serious matter.\r\n\r\nThe Wind Eaters were not long in getting accustomed to the, to them, at\r\nfirst, startling sight of “crimson tongues darting from the mouths of\r\nblack clouds.” In fact, they soon learned to like the odor of the\r\ndelicate morsels as they lay broiling on the embers, and when the air\r\nwas chilly, didn’t hesitate to form a circle around Bulger and me as we\r\nsat eating our dinner and enjoy the warmth, and to them, curious\r\nspectacle at the same time. It so happened that one evening, I had left\r\na deeper bed of embers than I had imagined. The ashes collected over\r\nthem and they continued to glow till nightfall. A band of roysterers\r\nbelonging to the Go-Whizz faction, by the merest chance, returned\r\nhomeward that night from a trip to the north shore of the island, where\r\nthey had gorged themselves upon the boisterous wind of that quarter.\r\nAttracted by the glow of the remaining embers, they made haste to gather\r\na lot of wood, threw it upon the smoldering fire, and, as the flames\r\nbegan to thrust out their red tongues here and there, ranged themselves\r\nin a circle to enjoy the warmth, for the night was damp and chilly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN GO-WHIZZ AND HIS LIEUTENANT THREATEN THE LITTLE\r\nBARON]\r\n\r\nSo pleasant did they find the effects of the warmth that they resolved\r\nto pass the night there and threw themselves down on the ground as close\r\nto the fire as they deemed it prudent to go.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight a gentle scratching on my arm from Bulger’s paw, told me\r\nthat something unusual had happened, for he never awakened me unless he\r\nwas quite sure that the matter was serious enough to warrant him in\r\ndisturbing me.\r\n\r\nI found the village in the wildest state of alarm. Ear-piercing screams\r\nfrom the women mingled with the deep rumbling outcries of the men.\r\n\r\nYou have no doubt, already guessed what had happened. The facts were\r\nsimply these: In the night, the cold had increased, and several of the\r\nWind Eaters, half asleep, and half stupefied by the deep draughts of the\r\nboisterous north-west wind, had approached closer and closer to the\r\nfire, when suddenly the vast quantity of cold air which they had\r\nswallowed began to expand and four of them exploded with a terrific\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nIn quicker time than it takes to tell it, my dwelling was surrounded by\r\na screaming, shrieking, howling mob of Wind Eaters, demanding my instant\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt required all of chief Ztwish-Ztwish’s influence with his people to\r\nsave me from being entangled in their fatal nets and beaten to death on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nTo make matters a thousand times worse, the bully and swaggerer,\r\nGo-Whizz, entered the village at this very moment, with a pack of his\r\nquarrelsome hangers-on at his heels. He had been away on a secret trip\r\nto the farthest northern point of the island, where the north wind howls\r\nand roars its maddest. I had never seen him puffed up so to the very\r\nbursting point with his favorite food.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard of the fate which had overtaken his four comrades, his\r\nfury knew no bounds. He and his followers pounded their chests until the\r\nair quivered with deep and rumbling sounds, while ever and anon they\r\nbroke out into the wildest lamentations for their dead companions. He\r\nopenly and boldly charged chief Ztwish-Ztwish with having betrayed his\r\npeople and given over their once happy island to certain ruin at the\r\nhands of the “little monster thick-all-through,” who, by his dread magic\r\nand foul mysteries, would soon bring their people to feed upon stones\r\nlike himself.\r\n\r\nDay now began to break; and with the coming light, the confusion in the\r\nvillage seemed to take on new strength. So sure was I that death was\r\nabout to strike me that I wrote out several messages to the elder baron\r\nand to the gentle baroness, my mother, on the leaves of my note-book,\r\nand left directions with one of the chief’s serving-men that, in case of\r\nmy death, it was my wish that he should send them to my people, whom he\r\nwould find on my ship in the beautiful bay on the distant shore of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nI said nothing about Bulger, for I knew only too well that he would die\r\nby my side.\r\n\r\nI prepared for the worst. I examined the primings of my pocket-pistols,\r\nand concealed my dagger under my coat at the back of my neck, where I\r\nwould be better able to reach it, if it came to close quarters.\r\n\r\nThis done, I proceeded to cut my finger-nails to as sharp points as I\r\ncould, for I was determined to sell my life as dearly as possible.\r\n\r\nWhile I felt confident of chief Ztwish-Ztwish’s affection for me, yet I\r\ncouldn’t tell at what moment he might lose courage and turn me over to\r\nthe mob, in order to save himself.\r\n\r\nBulger watched all my preparations with wide-opened and intelligent\r\neyes, occasionally giving utterance to a low, nervous whine, as the\r\nhowling, shrieking, roaring mob surged back and forth in front of chief\r\nZtwish-Ztwish’s dwelling.\r\n\r\nBy the law of the land, the common people were prohibited from entering\r\nthe inner enclosure of the chief’s abode, but Go-Whizz, being one of the\r\nnobles or minor chiefs, was entitled to advance into the chief’s\r\npresence and state his wrongs or make his requests.\r\n\r\nSo now, the raging Go-Whizz, parting from his followers, who never\r\nceased crying out for vengeance upon the “little demon Lump,” who, on\r\ntwo different occasions, had spread death and destruction among their\r\npeople, strode into the presence of chief Ztwish-Ztwish.\r\n\r\nThe chief was calm. He had not partaken of food for four and twenty\r\nhours, and stood up, wrinkled, creased and seamed, as the Wind Eaters\r\nalways look when fasting. Near him sat queen Phew-yoo and princess\r\nPouf-fâh, while directly behind him were ranged his three councillors,\r\nHiss-sah, Whirr-Whirr, and Sh-Boom. They were well-rounded out by recent\r\ndraughts of the strong and wholesome west wind, and hence, looked as\r\ncontented and smiling as Ztwish-Ztwish looked sad and solemn. I stood in\r\nan adjoining apartment, concealed behind a bamboo screen, with my\r\nfaithful Bulger by my side. I was so placed that I could see all,\r\nwithout being seen myself. Chief Ztwish-Ztwish knew of my presence\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAs Bulger caught a glimpse of the raging and bellowing Go-Whizz, he grew\r\nso nervous that I was obliged to stoop and stroke his head to let him\r\nknow I feared nothing. But the fact of the matter is, great dangers\r\nalways exert a subduing influence upon me.\r\n\r\nI face them cooly, but sadly, for my thoughts in such moments go back to\r\nthe elder baron and to the gentle baroness, my mother, in the far-away\r\nhome ’neath the skies of the beloved fatherland.\r\n\r\nLike a huge football impelled by the kick of some gigantic foot,\r\nGo-Whizz landed in the audience chamber of chief Ztwish-Ztwish. He shook\r\nhis arms violently, and bounded up and down with inward fury, for he was\r\nstill too much beside himself with rage to utter any other sound than a\r\ndeep rumbling growl or mutter.\r\n\r\nFrom my place behind the bamboo screen I followed, with all the keenness\r\nof sight for which I am so justly famous, every movement of the furious\r\nGo-Whizz, as well as the actions and demeanor of chief Ztwish-Ztwish and\r\nof his councillors, for I was determined not to be caught napping in\r\ncase any signs of treachery should be visible. At the very first glance\r\nI saw that the rebellious Go-Whizz had something hidden in his girdle,\r\nand from the shape and length I knew at once that it was a flint knife.\r\nQuick as thought, I beckoned a serving man to my side and sent a message\r\nto the chief, telling the attendant to appear to be engaged in waving\r\nthe branches of perfumed leaves as was his duty while he whispered it in\r\nthe chief’s ear.\r\n\r\nIt was as follows:\r\n\r\n“Be on thy guard! O, Chief. The brawler hath a flint knife hidden in his\r\ngirdle. He will attempt to slay thee. Be careful! Be calm!”\r\n\r\nGo-Whizz had now quieted down a little; but, with a voice of thunder, he\r\nbegan his tirade. He pictured the long years of peace and happiness on\r\ntheir island, the blessings they had enjoyed under the long and glorious\r\nline of rulers of which Ztwish-Ztwish was the worthy descendant. He\r\nthundered out defiance against all the enemies of the Wind Eaters and as\r\nsoftly as possible roared his own praises telling of the many deeds of\r\nvalor he had performed in Ztwish-Ztwish’s service and ended by declaring\r\nhimself ready and willing to die for his beloved chief.\r\n\r\nWhen Go-Whizz had spoken, the chief bowed his head for a few moments in\r\nsilence and then made answer: “Thou hast spoken truly and wisely, O\r\nGo-Whizz! Thou art brave. Thou hast the right to demand favor at my\r\nhands! Speak, Go-Whizz, what may Ztwish-Ztwish do for thee?”\r\n\r\nAt these words of Ztwish-Ztwish, all the former fury of Go-Whizz broke\r\nforth once more. Pounding his chest and striding up and down the\r\naudience chamber, he roared out:\r\n\r\n“That thou givest into my hands this very hour, the ‘Solid Demon,’ the\r\ndreaded ‘Man-Lump,’ the monster ‘Thick-All-Through’ who hath brought all\r\nthis death and ruin into our peaceful land!”\r\n\r\nChief Ztwish-Ztwish was silent for a few moments.\r\n\r\nNeed I tell you that my very heart listened for the reply?\r\n\r\nI could hear nothing but the deep, coarse, grating sound of Go-Whizz’s\r\nbreath as I leaned forward to catch the first word which should fall\r\nfrom the chief’s lips.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a lifetime. At length Ztwish-Ztwish spoke:\r\n\r\n“My brother, thou art inflamed with the deep draughts of the fierce and\r\nraging north wind! Thou art beside thyself. Thou seest not clearly! I\r\nmust not adjudge death except when the decree will rest on the laws of\r\nour fathers. True, the ‘Little Man-Thick-All-Through’ hath been the\r\ncause of great misfortune to our people, but the innocent cause. He hath\r\nnot striven or desired to harm us. He is a lover of peace, a friend of\r\nhis kind. My followers were warned of the danger of the crimson tongues.\r\nThe ‘Man Lump’ did not seek their death. And full well too, thou knowest\r\nthat the laws of our fathers bid us to hold the lives of our guests as\r\nsacred as the texture of our skin. Go thy way, therefore, Go-Whizz, I\r\ncannot doom the ‘Man Lump’ to death.\r\n\r\n“Is this,” roared the disappointed leader, “the kind of justice which\r\nthou givest to my people?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, is it, thou brawler!” replied chief Ztwish-Ztwish, now fast losing\r\ncontrol over himself. “Hold thy peace and depart, lest in my wrath at\r\nthy frequent wrong doing I give thee over to merited punishment!”\r\n\r\n“Have a care, Ztwish-Ztwish!” roared Go-Whizz, boiling over with rage,\r\n“have a care lest thy people rise in their might and cast thee out, thou\r\nunjust ruler!”\r\n\r\n“Begone, I say!” was Ztwish-Ztwish’s calm but stern reply.\r\n\r\n“Go thou first, then, traitor to thy people!” thundered out Go-Whizz,\r\nspringing forward with the flint knife raised high in the air.\r\n\r\nCries of terror burst from those gathered in the audience chamber. But\r\nchief Ztwish-Ztwish calmly put forth his hand and touched the would-be\r\nassassin.\r\n\r\nWith a deafening crack the body of the raging Go-Whizz flew into a\r\nthousand pieces, like a huge balloon seized by the hands of the tempest\r\nand whirled against the spear-like branches of some shattered oaken\r\nmonarch of the plain.\r\n\r\nQueen Phew-yoo and princess Pouf-fâh, bewildered and terror-stricken,\r\nclung to each other, while silent fear sat on the faces of those around\r\nthe chief. But he was calm, and spoke a few words in a mild and steady\r\nvoice to the queen and the princess.\r\n\r\nWhen the people learned of Go-Whizz’s attempt to slay their ruler and\r\nhow the brawler, at the very instant he lifted the flint knife to\r\nstrike, had been mysteriously stricken dead at Ztwish-Ztwish’s feet,\r\nthey sent up loud huzzas, for the fierce Go-Whizz was more feared than\r\nloved, even by his followers.\r\n\r\nIt required several days for the village of the Wind Eaters to quiet\r\ndown and take on its every-day look, after the mysterious death of\r\nGo-Whizz; but, with his disappearance vanished all opposition to chief\r\nZtwish-Ztwish’s rule.\r\n\r\nThe people firmly believed that it was the avenging spirits of the air\r\nwho had touched the brawler with their sword points when he raised his\r\nhand against their ruler.\r\n\r\nI need hardly tell you that the chief’s gratitude to me knew no bounds.\r\nNo gifts were too beautiful or too costly to be offered me. And the fact\r\nthat I declined them all, only seemed to strengthen his affection for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nBut how could I, how dared I reject the gift of the hand of the fair\r\nprincess Pouf-fâh?\r\n\r\nTo do this would be to undo all that I have done, to make Ztwish-Ztwish\r\nmy enemy, to transform his love into hate, his confidence into\r\nsuspicion—possibly to write my own death warrant.\r\n\r\nThere was but one course left for me to pursue. And that was escape!\r\n\r\nAnd escape, too, it must be at once, before I had lost the chief’s\r\nconfidence. One of Ztwish-Ztwish’s first acts after his rescue from the\r\nflint knife of the murderous Go-Whizz, was to restore to me the tiny\r\ninstrument with the invisible point.\r\n\r\nThis done, a terrible load seemed to be lifted from his mind. He became\r\nhimself again. And with his returning happiness and content, came a\r\nstill stronger desire to hasten my marriage with the princess Pouf-fâh.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest caution, I made this and that excuse, in order to gain\r\ntime to collect my thoughts and settle upon some sure plan of escape,\r\nfor recapture I knew meant death, or worse than death—imprisonment until\r\nI should consent to give up all desire to leave the island of the Wind\r\nEaters, and pledge myself to become, so far as nature would permit, one\r\nof their people.\r\n\r\nCautious as I was, my excuses awakened suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe first proof of this was to find that orders had been given to cut\r\noff my supply of fish.\r\n\r\nQueen Phew-yoo was afraid that so long as I was permitted to have all\r\nthe solid food I wanted, I would not grow thin enough to be content with\r\nair diet, and, therefore, not satisfied to make my home among them for\r\nthe rest of my life.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to happen to me was to find my supply of oysters and\r\nmussels reduced one-half by orders of Phew-yoo. This meant yield or\r\nstarve!\r\n\r\nIt struck me like a bolt out of a clear sky!\r\n\r\nBut it has always been just such blows as this which have, throughout my\r\nlife, aroused me to calm, quick, intelligent action.\r\n\r\nI hesitated no longer. My plan reached perfection in a single moment.\r\nWhen nightfall came I hastily scrawled a few lines addressed to my\r\nsailing-master, telling him of the fate which threatened to overtake me\r\nand bidding him arm a few trusty men and hasten to my rescue. This I\r\ntied to the collar of my loved and faithful Bulger. He covered my hand\r\nwith caresses and I held him clasped in my arms for an instant while the\r\ntears fell hot and fast. Then I softly opened the door of my bamboo\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\nThe night was bright and glorious. “Away, my beloved Bulger!” I\r\nwhispered, stooping and pressing my lips for the last time on his silken\r\nears and shapely head. “To the ship! Away!” He paused, looked into my\r\nface, gave a low whine as if to say: “Ay, ay, little master, I\r\nunderstand!” And away he sprang like the wind. For an instant I could\r\nfollow him as with a long and sturdy bound he sped along! And then he\r\nwas gone!\r\n\r\nThe next morning, to my utter astonishment, I was informed that all the\r\npreparations for the marriage of the princess Pouf-fâh and the “little\r\nman thick-all-through,” were completed and that the feasting and\r\nmerrymaking would begin the day following.\r\n\r\nThis piece of news, startling as it was, I received with perfect\r\ncalmness. I completely disarmed all suspicion by my apparent\r\nsatisfaction with the bright prospect of becoming the son-in-law of the\r\ngreat chief Ztwish-Ztwish. I searched my pockets for trinkets to bestow\r\nupon the light and airy Pouf-fâh.\r\n\r\nQueen Phew-yoo was not visible. So great had been the joy of her\r\nmother’s heart that in a moment of weakness she had partaken too\r\ngreedily of the rich, but unwholesome east wind and was now suffering\r\nfrom a fearful attack of dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nThis was a most fortunate thing for me, for I am quite certain that\r\nqueen Phew-yoo would never have consented to allow me to return to my\r\nown apartments that night. There was now but one thing left for me to do\r\nand that was to make for the distant sea-coast, where I had left my ship\r\nand crew.\r\n\r\nAnd start, too, that very night. As ill luck would have it, chief\r\nZtwish-Ztwish, noticing that a delightfully strong west wind had begun\r\nto blow insisted upon having a sort of preliminary feast about sundown.\r\n\r\nI was invited to join the party.\r\n\r\nNot daring to refuse, I set out with the merry-makers and not only tired\r\nmyself out by making frantic efforts to fill myself with their invisible\r\nfood but it was nearly midnight before the village grew perfectly quiet\r\nand everybody seemed to have closed the doors and windows of his\r\ndwelling. But, after all, the rioting of the Wind Eaters was a fortunate\r\nthing for me. They went to bed so gorged with many and deep draughts of\r\nthe hearty and filling west wind, that they slept like logs, if you will\r\nallow me to compare puff-balls to solid wood.\r\n\r\nI waited until the rumbling of the voices had died away as the last\r\ngroup of roysterers broke up and the solitary Wind Eaters, scattered\r\nalong the streets, disappeared one by one into their bamboo dwellings.\r\n\r\nLeaving my door fastened on the inside, I sprang lightly through the\r\nwindow, and under cover of the deep shadows made my way unnoticed to the\r\noutskirts of the town. Here I broke into a sharp run, for at very most I\r\nwould have but six hours’ start of the Wind Eaters and that was far too\r\nlittle; for, as I have already told you, they flit along like phantoms\r\nwhen in a fasting condition, and even when pretty well filled, are very\r\nswift of foot—more especially if the air be quiet so as not to impede\r\ntheir advance.\r\n\r\nOn, on, I sped with a desperate resolve to make such a good use of my\r\nstart as to make it impossible for them to overtake me.\r\n\r\nTo my horror, after about an hour’s run I noticed that my legs were\r\nbeginning to tire.\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible blow to me. For a few moments I staggered along half\r\nunconscious of where I was, whither I was hastening and of the awful\r\ndanger threatening me. All at once the truth of the matter broke upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI was but the wreck of my former self. The long months of fish diet had\r\nrobbed my muscles of that wonderful strength and elasticity which was\r\nonce my pride and my chief dependence in moments of peril.\r\n\r\nFrail as I had grown, my legs now bent beneath me.\r\n\r\nSlower and slower grew my pace. My heart seemed to swell and shut out\r\nthe very breath of life.\r\n\r\nOn, ever onward, I toiled with a desperate effort to escape my pursuers,\r\nwhose rumbling voices it half seemed to me were faintly booming in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nBut Nature would do no more!\r\n\r\nI reeled, I staggered, I stopped, I fell!\r\n\r\nHow long I lay there I know not. But when I came to myself, I could\r\nplainly feel that change in the air which tells of the coming day. The\r\nrippling of a brook fell on my ear. I dragged my aching body in the\r\ndirection the sound came from. A deep pull at the cool, clear water of\r\nthe brook refreshed me somewhat. I attempted to rise; but, O, new loss\r\nof hope—to discover that my joints had stiffened while sleeping on the\r\nground, uncovered, yes, even ill-clad, for I had left one piece of my\r\nclothing hanging on the window-sill of my lodge in the village, to quiet\r\nany suspicion which might arise in the minds of the serving-men.\r\n\r\nThoughts of home, however, of the elder baron, of the gentle baroness,\r\nmy mother, of my loved Bulger, flitted through my fevered brain, and\r\nprompted me to make one more effort to regain my feet and escape death\r\nat the hands of chief Ztwish-Ztwish’s enraged people, who would soon be\r\nbounding along, up hill and down dale, like spirits of the wind, as they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nA groan escaped my lips as I rose to my feet, so like knife-points in my\r\njoints were the pains which shot through my frame.\r\n\r\nBut I must try to be up and away, even though the effort cost me a\r\nthousand agonizing twinges.\r\n\r\nI owe it to the loved ones at home to push on till I fall utterly\r\nbroken, till, like a stricken beast, robbed of the power to stand, I\r\nshould topple and fall at the feet and at the mercy of my pursuers.\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts which oppressed my poor, reeling brain.\r\n\r\nA terrible mystery, a torturing dream weighed me down.\r\n\r\nI still had my mind. I could see. I could feel. I could hear. And why\r\nshould I not rise and move onward, and away from the certain death which\r\nhovered over me?\r\n\r\nCrazed by such thoughts, I struggled to my feet and staggered along,\r\nsending forth a groan with every step!\r\n\r\nBut I had steeled myself to the task, and dragged myself along, still\r\noppressed by some strange and mysterious power, which gave to every\r\npebble the rock’s size, and widened every gully to a yawning chasm, on\r\nthe brink of which I paused in sickening fear of plunging into some\r\nblack abyss. And yet, oh joy! gradually the films faded from my eyes,\r\nthe mysterious power lifted its spell from my brain. I felt more like\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI saw clearer. My step grew firmer. Now, at last, thought I, all is\r\ngoing well!\r\n\r\nWhen, suddenly, a long, blue-gray streak of light flashed along over the\r\nheads of the hills in the far distant eastern sky. It was the signal of\r\nmorning!\r\n\r\nAgain, with a groan I sank on my knees, caught myself, rose half-dazed,\r\npressed on again, slowly, slowly, every step jarring on my heated brain\r\nlike a hammer’s blow; but still onward, onward!\r\n\r\nA terrible grip as of some giant hand—palm of iron and fingers of\r\nsteel—set itself on my very vitals. The thought that even now my escape\r\nwas known to my enemies, that the phantom Wind Eaters, armed with their\r\nnets and clubs, were flitting out of the streets of chief\r\nZtwish-Ztwish’s village, charged to carry me back alive to a worse death\r\nthan death itself, or slay me for having broken faith and set the face\r\nof honesty over my fraud and deceit, seemed to paralyze my limbs and rob\r\nme of the little strength I had left.\r\n\r\nStill on and ever onward I struggled, like one in the dull stupor of the\r\nwine cup. Fast! ah, too fast that streak of gray dawn lengthened and\r\nwidened and the orb of day shot up through the morning shadows a\r\nmessenger of light here and there, now weak and fitful, now stronger and\r\nfarther reaching.\r\n\r\nI saw them, ay, I felt them, for in my dread of them they seemed to\r\nflash toward me and strike my half closed eyes, as if knocking at the\r\nwindows of my soul and rousing me to move out of death’s harm.\r\n\r\nFor a brief moment I halted as if expecting some fond, familiar voice to\r\nring in my ears.\r\n\r\nIt came.\r\n\r\nIt was the gentle baroness, my mother! Gently, softly, sweetly, that\r\nwell-known voice came floating on the morning air bidding me take heart,\r\ncalling me by name just as in childhood’s days, and saying: “My baby! my\r\nboy! my son! my darling! Rouse thee! Press on! Press on quickly!” And\r\nthen I took heart.\r\n\r\nThe fearful clamp set on my breast relaxed its hold.\r\n\r\nI could feel my strength returning. But oh, so slowly, so slowly! Still,\r\nit was on its way back at last! I could feel my feet grow lighter. With\r\nsome effort I quickened my pace almost to a run.\r\n\r\nOn, on, I sped, now every instant giving me new strength, every motion\r\nsending the warm blood tingling to my fingers’ ends.\r\n\r\nThe spell had been lifted! I was myself again!\r\n\r\nSwifter, and swifter my pace quickened until I flew along as in days of\r\nold, when with ease I left all comers far behind me!\r\n\r\nMethought I could almost hear the plash of the waves on the snow-white\r\nsands of that beautiful harbor where my good ship lay.\r\n\r\nOn, and ever onward, I sped with a new and mysterious strength. I was\r\nastounded at my own deeds. I was almost afraid, so fast I was bounding\r\nalong, lest again some demon of the air should touch my limbs and stay\r\nmy course.\r\n\r\nBut hark! Didn’t you hear that deep rumble?\r\n\r\nThe sky is clear. It cannot have been the voice of the storm fiend.\r\n\r\nHa! again, deeper and clearer than before, that hoarse, low, muttering\r\nrumble, half-roar, half-growl comes borne along on the wings of the\r\nawakened breeze.\r\n\r\nLost! Lost! Lost!\r\n\r\nIt is the cry of the pursuers, it is the voice of the enemy!\r\n\r\nThose children of the air are on my track. They follow me with leap and\r\njump. What madness to think to outrun them. Let me halt and die like a\r\nman! Look how they bound along over the plain!\r\n\r\nSwift and noiseless are their steps, phantoms that they are!\r\n\r\nI halt. I turn. I grasp my fire-arm! Too late! A score of entangling\r\nnets envelope me! I struggle only to entwine myself the more, arms,\r\nhands, legs, feet, are twisted in wretched confusion.\r\n\r\nI sway, fall, roll over, wrapped ’round and ’round in that dreadful\r\ntangle!\r\n\r\nAnd now down upon my defenceless body comes a rain of sharp, stinging\r\nblows. Deep rumbling cries fill the air and keep time in a wild way with\r\nthe showers of blows rained on my face and head and hands.\r\n\r\nAs they continue they seem to increase in strength.\r\n\r\nThe pain, bearable at first, now becomes excruciating.\r\n\r\nThe light goes out of my eyes, swollen shut as they are beneath this\r\ncruel pelting.\r\n\r\nA thousand ringing sounds assail my ears.\r\n\r\nMy brain reels—I am going—going—dying—\r\n\r\nWhen, hark again!\r\n\r\nYou can not hear it! Your ears would not know it! But mine do! Mine do!\r\n\r\n’Tis Bulger’s bark and I am saved! Faster and faster the Wind Eaters ply\r\ntheir clubs.\r\n\r\nI do not heed them. I do not feel them now, for nearer and nearer comes\r\nthat joyous music.\r\n\r\n’Tis here!\r\n\r\nI’m strong again. I rise half up—my lips move—I speak—I cry out: “Quick,\r\ngood Bulger, or all is lost!” A single glance at the terrible plight of\r\nhis little master tells him all. With a howl of rage, his dark eyes\r\nshooting flame, he throws himself upon the heels of the Wind Eaters. His\r\nsharp teeth pierce like needles!\r\n\r\nCrack!\r\n\r\nAgain and again he sends his fangs through the skin of a Wind Eater.\r\n\r\nCrack! Crack!\r\n\r\nTheir clubs cease swinging. A cry of horror goes up, as for the fourth\r\ntime good Bulger’s teeth pierces the heel of a Wind Eater and sends his\r\nbody with a loud report to vanish into thin air.\r\n\r\nThey turn; they break away in wild dismay; they fly for their lives,\r\ncasting away their clubs and abandoning their victim. I could see no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIt grew black, a vertigo seized me. I tried to free my hands to touch my\r\nloved Bulger, for death, I thought, had come!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen life came back Bulger was licking my hands and face and whining\r\npiteously. He had gnawed the netting free from the limbs of his little\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nWith a cry of joy and a brust of tears, I caught that faithful, loving\r\ncreature to my breast.\r\n\r\nAt that instant, distant shouts came floating over the hills. They came\r\nfrom my sailing-master and his relief party.\r\n\r\nI could not answer. But Bulger raised his head and sent forth a few\r\nsharp barks to tell them where we were.\r\n\r\nIn a short half hour they were at my side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AS I APPEARED THE DAY AFTER MY RESCUE BY BULGER.]\r\n\r\nAfter my bruised face and hands had been bathed in cool water and I had\r\nswallowed a few mouthfuls of wine, I felt strong enough to get on my\r\nfeet and move slowly forward.\r\n\r\nBulger walked proudly by my side, pausing ever and anon to look me in\r\nthe face, meaning to ask:\r\n\r\n“How goes it with thee, little master?” Once on shipboard, strengthened\r\nby good food and cheered by the comforts of my cabin, I was not long in\r\ngetting my health back again. After a week’s rest, I gave orders to\r\nweigh anchor and turn our good ship’s head northward, for I was anxious,\r\nvery anxious to see the elder baron and the gentle baroness, my mother,\r\nand tell them all about the wonderful things I had seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  How the elder Baron and the Baroness received Bulger and me upon our\r\n    return from our first voyage. I am decorated by the Emperor with the\r\n    grand cross of the Crimson Cincture. The elder Baron presents me\r\n    with a copy of an ancient Roman newspaper. I read of the murder of\r\n    the beautiful Paula, and the banishment by Cæsar of the Seven\r\n    Sculptors to a far-away island in the southern seas. I resolved to\r\n    set out in search of the Island. My departure. Trouble with crew. My\r\n    sailing-master loses his reason. I hear the cry, Land ho! It is the\r\n    Sculptors’ Island. Description of it. I go ashore. Paula’s statue.\r\n    Adventures on the Island. Bulger makes a wonderful discovery.\r\n    Something about the strange people who inhabit the Island. Their\r\n    habits, their pleasures, their characters. I am overtaken by an\r\n    alarming melancholy. My awful dread at thought of becoming as one of\r\n    the dwellers on the Sculptors’ Isle. I learn of the existence of\r\n    Antonius. I seek him. Vain endeavor to grasp his hand. Our\r\n    interview. The strange and moving history of the Seven Sculptors and\r\n    their descendants. How they were transformed into the Slow Movers.\r\n    Bulger and I propose to leave the Island. Extraordinary conduct of a\r\n    bust of the great Cæsar. Our farewell to the Slow Movers. Their\r\n    adieu. Our good ship sails away.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAUTIFUL PAULA.]\r\n\r\nUpon my return from my first journey to far away lands, the elder baron\r\nand his faithful spouse, my beloved mother, followed by all the\r\nretainers of the household, met Bulger and me at the outer gate and\r\nwelcomed us home with that wild and boisterous joy which only German\r\nhearts are capable of.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron threw his arms around my neck, and, forgetful of the\r\nfact that I was only half his size, lifted me completely off the ground\r\nin the unreasoning joy of a father’s heart, nearly throttling me.\r\n\r\nI kicked vigorously, but, the soft felt soles of my oriental shoes\r\nprevented me from giving him to understand that he was fast choking me\r\nto death.\r\n\r\nAt last my thoughtful mother noticed that I was growing black in the\r\nface, and laying hold of my legs, pulled me downward out of the\r\ndangerous embrace in which the elder baron had wrapped me. Not, however,\r\nuntil my father’s Nuremberg egg had bored painfully into my protuberant\r\nbrow, adding another bump to that already bumpy territory. Upon noticing\r\nwhich the elder baron dispatched an attendant to his apartment with\r\norders to search his medicine chest for a bottle of volatile liniment.\r\nIn his eagerness to undo the harm he had inflicted, he poured a stream\r\nof acrid liquid into my eyes, causing me intense suffering. This red and\r\ninflamed condition of my eyes, however, the tenants, and retainers\r\nattributed to my emotion upon entering the baronial hall once more,\r\nafter so long an absence.\r\n\r\nI didn’t regret this little accident at all, for while I am opposed to\r\nthat ready-made style of emotion which some people always keep on hand,\r\nI have no objections to a noble and dignified use of tears.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that every body was delighted to see Bulger. They\r\nall found that he had increased in size, beauty and intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe received all this homage with a dignity that was charming to behold.\r\n\r\nTo impress the crowd with a due sense of that discipline and\r\nself-control which he acquired as the constant companion and confidant\r\nof his master, he absolutely refused to touch the many tid-bits and\r\ndainty morsels which the retainers offered him, and gazed with the\r\nutmost indifference at the other dogs in their mad scramblings for the\r\nfood which he had declined.\r\n\r\nI was very proud of him.\r\n\r\nIn a few days everything had settled down to its wonted quiet again\r\nbeneath the baronial roof. Evenings I passed giving accounts of the many\r\nwonderful things I had seen while abroad.\r\n\r\nTo these sittings, a few of the older and more confidential household\r\nservants were admitted.\r\n\r\nMy good mother arranged them in a semi-circle behind the chairs of the\r\nelder baron and his guests. I, with Bulger by my side, occupied a dais,\r\neither seated by the side of a table holding my curiosities or standing\r\nin front of my auditors in an easy position, while I held them\r\nspell-bound by my narration.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that worried me, and it was this: How will the elder\r\nbaron receive the announcement of my intention to leave home again, ere\r\nmany moons?\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise and delight he didn’t even wait for me to make\r\nknown my intentions.\r\n\r\nWhile seated in my library, one day, poring over a very rare book of\r\ntravels which I had just purchased, a gentle tap at the door caused\r\nBulger to raise his head and give a low growl.\r\n\r\n“Come in!” said I.\r\n\r\nIt was the elder baron.\r\n\r\n“I disturb you!” he began.\r\n\r\n“You have that right, baron,” I replied, with a gracious smile; “be\r\nseated, pray.”\r\n\r\nAnd saying this, I arranged the pelt of a very beautiful and rare animal\r\nwhich I had killed while abroad, so as to make a comfortable seat for\r\nthe elder baron on the canopy.\r\n\r\n“My son!” said the baron, “I come to bring thee this little token from\r\nour gracious master, the Emperor.”\r\n\r\nI looked up.\r\n\r\nHe held in his hand the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Crimson\r\nCincture.\r\n\r\nI laid the bauble on the table.\r\n\r\n“Little baron,” continued my father, “I am well pleased with thee.”\r\n\r\nI made a low obeisance.\r\n\r\n“Thy marvelous adventures fill all mouths. Thou hast set a new lustre on\r\nthe family name, and I come to rouse thee from thy apparent sloth. Thou\r\nmust be up and doing. Thou must shake off this indolence which will gain\r\nan increased power over thee each passing hour. New triumphs await thee.\r\nGo forth once more. Turn aside out of the beaten paths. Seek the\r\nwonderful and marvelous. But ere thou settest forth, ponder the contents\r\nof this parchment roll. Many years ago, when the down of manhood first\r\ncame upon my cheek, and before life’s burdens had come to lie heavily on\r\nmy soul, I found it in the damp and noisome vaults of an ancient Roman\r\nConvent, which the pestilential air of an encroaching marsh had emptied\r\nof its inmates. It may turn thy footsteps toward something strange and\r\ninteresting!”\r\n\r\nConcealing with difficulty the joy occasioned by my father’s words and\r\nmy earnestness to know the contents of the parchment roll, I returned\r\nthe elder baron’s salutation with marked respect, and he withdrew.\r\n\r\nI need not assure the reader of the almost breathless anxiety with which\r\nI unrolled the volume.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Latin tongue, and was the work of a scribe.\r\n\r\nThe ink had faded somewhat, but, even in places where it had entirely\r\ndisappeared, I could by the aid of a strong lens readily trace out the\r\nwords by the lines scratched into the parchment by the point of the reed\r\npen.\r\n\r\nIt was a copy of an ancient Roman newspaper or Acta Diurna, and bore a\r\ndate corresponding to our forty-fifth year before the present era.\r\n\r\nCæsar was at the height of his power.\r\n\r\nPeace reigned, the arts flourished. Rome, the centre of the world, was\r\nthe home of a glory and magnificence far beyond anything the eyes of man\r\nhad yet gazed upon.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this copy of the Acta Diurna were largely made up of\r\ndetailed accounts of a famous trial just completed at Rome, in which\r\nseven noted sculptors had been found guilty of poisoning a beautiful\r\nmaid named Paula, after they had each completed a statue of her, in\r\norder that no other sculptors should ever be able to make use of her for\r\nthe same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe judges had pronounced the sentence of death upon them, but in\r\nconsideration of their splendid services in beautifying the imperial\r\ncity, Cæsar had changed their punishment from death to life-long exile.\r\n\r\nThe seven sculptors had been transported in an imperial galley to a\r\nfar-away island in the Southern Seas. As stated in this copy of the Acta\r\nDiurna it was the most remote piece of land belonging to the Roman\r\nEmpire lying to the Southward:\r\n\r\n“Ad insulam remotissimam imperii romani medianorum.”\r\n\r\nAs an additional act of the imperial clemency the wives and children of\r\nthe condemned sculptors had been graciously accorded permission to\r\nfollow their husbands and fathers into their terrible exile.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished reading all the minute details of this strange crime\r\nand its awful results, I found that my blood was coursing through my\r\nveins with a mad violence. I paced the floor with such a quick and\r\nnervous step and with agitation so plainly visible in my looks, that I\r\nwas aroused from my reverie by the anxious whining of Bulger, who was\r\nfollowing me about the room close upon my heels.\r\n\r\nWhy not go in quest of this far-away isle to which these seven sculptors\r\nand their families were transported by command of great Cæsar?\r\n\r\nPerchance in that far-distant isle dwells a race of beings who,\r\nforgetting the world, and forgotten by it, will, by their strange habits\r\nand peculiar customs so interest me as to repay me for all the dangers I\r\nmay run in crossing untracked seas and turning aside from ocean paths.\r\n\r\nPerchance their descendants may be living yet?\r\n\r\nThis idea now took possession of my whole being.\r\n\r\nSleep was impossible.\r\n\r\nFar into the night I pored over ancient charts.\r\n\r\nWhile deepest silence enwrapped the baronial halls, I worked out in my\r\nmind, or, rather, let my mind work out, the course which I should\r\npursue.\r\n\r\nFor it was always a custom of mine never to attempt to solve the\r\nunsolvable. In fact, I early made the discovery that any interference on\r\nmy part with the mysterious workings of my mind tended rather to impede\r\nits action.\r\n\r\nSo I waited calmly for light.\r\n\r\nIt came at last.\r\n\r\nClosing my eyes, with my inner sight I could see a map of the eastern\r\nworld traced in glowing, shimmering lines upon an inky background.\r\n\r\nAnd there, too, could I see my course marked out in dotted lines of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWith a loud, ringing cry of joy I sprang to my feet and exclaimed: “I\r\nshall find this wonderful isle! I shall unlock the portals of the\r\nSouthern seas! I shall gaze upon the descendants of Paula’s murderers!\r\n\r\n“Come, Bulger! Away! Away!”\r\n\r\nHastily bidding adieu to my parents, I swung myself into the saddle,\r\nand, with Bulger securely strapped en croupe, dashed madly away towards\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n“The baron’s mad son is off again!” cried the peasants, as I galloped\r\npast their farm houses.\r\n\r\nIn three days I stood upon the deck of my vessel.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to my orders, the captain’s hand literally rested upon the\r\nhelm.\r\n\r\nAll that day he had been standing with his eyes riveted upon the shore,\r\nfor something told him that I could not be far away.\r\n\r\nEverything was in readiness, even to the last biscuit.\r\n\r\nAs Bulger and I leaped over the rail, my good ship rounded to the wind,\r\nand darted away like a thing of life.\r\n\r\nThe blood tingled in my veins at sight of the blue waves and white\r\nbellying sails.\r\n\r\nBulger gave vent to his satisfaction in mad gambols and ear-piercing\r\nbarks.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly an auspicious beginning.\r\n\r\nLeaving the command of the ship to the mate, the captain joined me in\r\nthe cabin, where I unfolded to him my project of sailing in the Southern\r\nseas in quest of a long-forgotten island.\r\n\r\nHe made haste to unroll his chart and adjust his spectacles, in order to\r\nfix the location of the island when I should give him the latitude and\r\nlongitude.\r\n\r\nFancy his almost consternation when I told him that the only proof I had\r\nof the existence of such an island was the brief mention in the ancient\r\nRoman newspaper.\r\n\r\nWas I mad?\r\n\r\nDid I care no more for life than to throw it away in such a foolhardy\r\nundertaking?\r\n\r\nHad I no idea of the rage of the terrible typhoon, the treachery of the\r\nhidden reef, the weight of the watery mountains which would topple on\r\nour deck?\r\n\r\nCould I expect seamen to go where there was no record that the most\r\nadventurous sailors of past centuries had ever ploughed the water?\r\n\r\nI smiled.\r\n\r\n“Master,” said I, after a moment’s silence, “this ship is mine, and you\r\nhave sworn to serve me like a true seaman, but if your courage has\r\nfailed you, you shall be put ashore at the first port we make. Go!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, little baron,” cried the skipper, “I was only testing your\r\nresolution. If you have the courage to sail into unknown seas, I have\r\nthe courage to follow you, come bright skies and calm waters or come\r\nstorm clouds and thunderbolt!”\r\n\r\nI shook the old man’s hand, and bade him go on deck, for at last sleep\r\nhad come to my wakeful eyes—the first time in three whole weeks—and I\r\nwanted to be alone.\r\n\r\nIn a few days we passed the Straits of Gibraltar and turned southward,\r\nkeeping the African coat in sight.\r\n\r\nI passed my time perfecting myself in the Latin language, and often\r\ncalled forth very vigorous protestations from Bulger by addressing him\r\nin that tongue, and making use of him as a sort of audience before which\r\nI delivered my speeches after I had rounded them and polished them.\r\n\r\nThe only stops we made now were for water or provisions.\r\n\r\nBy daylight and starlight my staunch ship bounded along on her course as\r\nif some friendly nereids were pushing at her stern. In the long watches\r\nof the night I lay in my hammock and pictured to myself that Roman\r\ngalley as it bore those seven exiles with kith and kin away from their\r\nbeloved land forever.\r\n\r\nEre another moon had bent her crescent in the evening sky we had reached\r\nthe Cape, and came to anchor with intent to overhaul our ship most\r\nthoroughly before going farther southward.\r\n\r\nThis occupied several days.\r\n\r\nI chafed under the delay.\r\n\r\nTen times a day I summoned the ship’s master to my cabin and urged him\r\nto make greater haste. He bore with me most patiently. My heart gave a\r\nleap, when, at last, I heard the master order the crew to set the sails.\r\n\r\nThe seamen were singing and tugging away at the main-sheets as I stepped\r\nupon the deck.\r\n\r\n“How shall I head her, little Baron?” asked the master, raising his hand\r\nto his cap.\r\n\r\n“Dead to the southward!” I replied.\r\n\r\nHe stood transfixed.\r\n\r\nHe had thought that we would round the Cape and follow the usual course\r\nto the Indies.\r\n\r\nHis lips move as if to protest.\r\n\r\nI cut him short, however, with an imperious wave of the hand.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the sailors, noticing the pallor which had overspread the\r\ncaptain’s face, drew near and stood gazing upon us, half wonderingly,\r\nhalf inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Captain!” said I calmly, but quite loud enough to be overheard by the\r\nmen standing in a group near by, “my pistols were made by the Emperor’s\r\narmorer. They never miss fire. Let me find you changing this vessel’s\r\ncourse a single point east or west of south and I’ll kill you in your\r\ntracks!”\r\n\r\nSaying this I walked away.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment all went well.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s master saw that I was determined to have my way, even if I\r\nlost my life in consequence, and he yielded.\r\n\r\nTurning around to the group of sailors, I called out:\r\n\r\n“A thousand ducats to the man who first sights land!”\r\n\r\nA hearty cheer rent the air, and calling to Bulger to follow me, I went\r\nbelow to think.\r\n\r\nThat night I not only took the precaution to hang a lanthorn so that I\r\ncould lie in my hammock and see a ship’s compass at any time I might\r\nawake, but, fearful lest some treachery might be attempted, I ordered my\r\nfaithful Bulger to sleep with his back against the door so that the\r\nleast vibration would arouse him.\r\n\r\nNight after night these precautions were followed out most strictly.\r\nDuring the day, too, my pistols were always in my belt.\r\n\r\nBulger felt the danger I was in, and he, by his vigilance gave me the\r\nadvantage of eyes in the back of my head.\r\n\r\nA low growl warned me of the approach of the master or one of the crew.\r\n\r\nThus protected and guarded, I felt that nothing save a general mutiny\r\nneed be feared. And this I knew to be almost impossible, for a number of\r\nthe crew were too devoted to me to listen to any traitorous proposals.\r\nThey would have slain the master in cold blood had he dared to breathe\r\nthe word mutiny!\r\n\r\nThings went very well for about ten days when I saw that a terrible\r\nstruggle was going on in the captain’s mind.\r\n\r\nI began to fear that he might lose his reason and throw himself into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nHis face took on a yellow-greenish hue.\r\n\r\nHe was literally dying of fright.\r\n\r\nOne morning he threw himself upon his knees in front of me, and with\r\ntear-stained cheeks implored me to put back to the African coast again.\r\n\r\nI did all I could to quiet him, but in vain.\r\n\r\nHis reason was slowly but surely giving way.\r\n\r\nCalling the mate to me, I put him in command of the vessel, and directed\r\nhim to confine the captain in his cabin and place a guard over him.\r\n\r\nIt cut me to the heart to be obliged to do this, for the poor fellow\r\nbegged like a dog to be left in command of his ship.\r\n\r\nBut I was deaf to his entreaties.\r\n\r\nI felt that now all trouble was at an end.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing fifteen knots an hour.\r\n\r\nEvery stitch of sail had been crowded on.\r\n\r\nWe fairly leapt out of the water like a thing of life, half flying half\r\nswimming.\r\n\r\nEver and anon I glanced at the compass.\r\n\r\nShe was headed dead south.\r\n\r\nMy cheeks tingled and I could feel the flow of warm blood through every\r\nvein in my body.\r\n\r\nThe moon went up like a shield of burnished gold. The sea glittered like\r\nliquid fire. Anon, a porpoise leaped into the air and sent a thousand\r\nripples circling away as he plunged into the water again\r\n\r\nOur good ship cleft the glassy bosom of the sea like some huge black\r\nmonster of the deep, and left a trail of fire in her wake as far as the\r\neye could reach.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight I went to rest.\r\n\r\nBut neither rest nor sleep was possible.\r\n\r\nHalf undressing, I threw myself into my hammock, and Bulger took his\r\naccustomed place at the door.\r\n\r\nThe lanthorn was not strong enough to overcome the light of the full\r\nmoon. It streamed through the bull’s eyes in weird, fantastic rays, and\r\ncrowded my cabin with strange and mysterious forms.\r\n\r\nThey were seven!\r\n\r\nTheir faces and figures were godlike, so white, so beautiful were they.\r\n\r\nThere was an indescribable sadness in their full dark eyes.\r\n\r\nThey spake not a word.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the paneling of the cabin ceiling parted, and disclosed a\r\nstaircase wrapped in dim, uncertain light.\r\n\r\nAdown these steps came a most gracious being, so white and fair and\r\nlovely that I gazed with bated breath.\r\n\r\nDown, down it came, nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nShe needed but wings to be an angel!\r\n\r\nBut, oh! her fair face was so filled with sorrow!\r\n\r\nHer lips were parted, her long black hair fell in confused tresses on\r\nher shoulders.\r\n\r\nShe stepped into the cabin. And then, with a quick, dread look, her gaze\r\nfell upon the seven bowed figures.\r\n\r\n“Paula!” they cried, and drew their white robes over their heads.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Land ho! Land ho!”\r\n\r\nWhat! Could I believe my ears?\r\n\r\n“Land ho! Land ho!”\r\n\r\nWith a bound I sprang from my hammock and rushed upon deck.\r\n\r\nAy, it was true! There, half a mile ahead of us, was a sight that\r\nstunned me like the blow of a bludgeon.\r\n\r\nLand it was, but not such a land as in my wildest dreams I had hoped to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nTen thousand lights glimmered on that mysterious shore, and illumined\r\nthe front of a Roman temple whiter than milk. A marble staircase of the\r\nsame hue led down to the very water’s edge.\r\n\r\nA sacrifice was in progress.\r\n\r\nFrom the highest terrace a column of black smoke curled slowly upward.\r\n\r\nNo sound reached my ear.\r\n\r\nI stood almost bereft of my senses.\r\n\r\nAt last, my power of speech returned. I ordered anchor to be cast, and\r\nclinging to the shrouds of my good ship, gazed long and joyfully upon\r\nthe entrancing scene.\r\n\r\nThe land rose in natural terraces from the seashore, and no matter in\r\nwhat direction you looked, your eye caught glimpses of a graceful statue\r\nor group of statuary gleaming in the white moonlight, amid the dark\r\nfoliage, like white-robed figures astray in a wood.\r\n\r\n“It must be!” I murmured to myself.\r\n\r\n“I have found it! This Roman temple, this marble stairway, these groups\r\nof statuary, all point to the glorious success of my voyage of\r\ndiscovery. This is the Sculptors’ Isle!”\r\n\r\nHow long I stood there gazing upon this beautiful shore I know not. Some\r\none pulling gently at my sleeve roused me from my reverie.\r\n\r\nIt was Bulger.\r\n\r\nI stooped and stroked his head for a few moments.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I awoke to a sense of great weariness, and casting another\r\nglance toward that mysterious shore, I turned and descended to the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nI soon fell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nThe terrible strain upon my nerves since leaving the Cape, caused by the\r\nhalf mutiny of the crew, the insanity of the ship’s master, and the long\r\nwatches through which I had lain and listened for the cry of land, had\r\nat last told upon me.\r\n\r\nThe sun was several hours high when I sprang out of my hammock and\r\nrushed upon deck.\r\n\r\nCould it all have been a dream? Should I find the noble temple,\r\nstaircase of marble, and all the towering statues melted away into thin\r\nair?\r\n\r\nAh no!\r\n\r\nThat beautiful shore was still there, unrolled before my wondering eyes\r\nlike some fair picture full of light and grace and delicious coloring.\r\n\r\n“Man the launch!” I called out and in quicker time than it takes to tell\r\nit, I was on my way to the shore of the Sculptors’ Isle.\r\n\r\nFaithful Bulger sat beside me, his eyes bright and expressive as he\r\ngazed into my face.\r\n\r\nLanding at the foot of the marble stairway, I sprang lightly out of the\r\nlaunch, followed by Bulger, and bounded up the marble steps.\r\n\r\nThere were three landings before I reached the level of the temple, from\r\neach of which the outlook grew more and more delightful. In truth, it\r\nwas a glorious approach to produce which art and nature had fairly\r\noutdone themselves. At length I cleared the last flight of steps, and\r\nwith a throbbing heart crossed the tessellated court and paused in front\r\nof the entrance to the temple.\r\n\r\nThe embers were still smouldering on the altar, around which stood\r\nseveral white-robed priests with low-bowed heads and averted faces.\r\nUnwilling to break in upon their solemn office, I turned and followed a\r\nbroad way, paved with marble and shaded by most graceful trees and\r\ntrailing vines.\r\n\r\nAt every step my eyes fell upon some statue of ravishing beauty—now\r\nnymphs; now goddess; now Jove himself; now the great Cæsar; now the fair\r\nGraces; now terrible Pluto; now smiling Ceres; now the crescent-crowned\r\nDiana, accoutered for the chase; now dancing satyrs; now goat-footed\r\nPan; now some Roman hero or statesman; and ever and anon, came the\r\nfigure of a maiden, wondrously fair, but with an unutterable look of\r\nsadness upon her beautiful face. So often did the same figure meet my\r\ngaze that I was led at last to approach its pedestal in hopes of finding\r\nsome explanation. I gave a cry of pleasure as my eyes fell upon the name\r\nsculptured there.\r\n\r\nIt was Paula.\r\n\r\nNow every doubt was dissipated.\r\n\r\nI had indeed found the Sculptors’ Isle\r\n\r\nBroad winding paths, leading right and left, now lured my footsteps. No\r\nfairy land could be more beautiful.\r\n\r\nGolden fruit glistened ’mid the dark green leaves.\r\n\r\nFlowers of countless hues bloomed on every side, sending forth the most\r\ndelicate perfumes. Trailing vines hung in graceful festoons or twined\r\naround the pedestals of the statues, carrying their white blossoms to\r\nthe whiter hands of these silent and motionless inhabitants of this\r\nregion of loneliness. I say inhabitants, for as yet my eye had seen no\r\nliving creature, save the priests grouped about the altar.\r\n\r\nHave I landed upon the shores of an island, upon which nature, with a\r\nlavish hand, has bestowed stately forests, placid lakes, purling brooks,\r\ntrees laden with delicious fruits, plants waving their flowery tassels\r\nand plumes in the perfumed air, vines trailing their richly variegated\r\nfoliage from tree to tree, a radiant sky above, a soil clad with velvety\r\nverdure beneath, only to find it abandoned, deserted of man; a thing of\r\nbeauty and yet loneliness, a mere polished and painted shell, out of\r\nwhich all life has gone forever?\r\n\r\nSuch was the train of thought which busied my mind as I strolled along\r\nthrough these winding paths paved with marble shut in by a leafy roof,\r\nthrough which ever and anon the sunlight burst to light up the\r\nmasterpieces of the sculptor’s art, around whose pedestals climbed and\r\nclambered scores of flowering vines, some carrying in their curved laps\r\nclusters of berries, brighter in hue than burnished gold, others holding\r\nout to the passer-by bunches of grapes deeper in purple than the Lydian\r\ndye.\r\n\r\nAs I pursued my way through this enchanted garden, in which the swaying\r\nlily stalks bent their perfumed-filled cups down to my cheeks and the\r\ntrees dropped their gold and purple fruit at my feet, while deep in the\r\nbosky thicket of red-leaved shrubs and silken-tufted pine, the\r\nmelancholy nightingale warbled his liquid melody in slow and plaintive\r\nmeasure, my heart yearned for the sound of a human voice.\r\n\r\n“Would that some living being,” I cried, “no matter how bent and twisted\r\nin figure, or how discordant in voice, might come forth to meet me in\r\nthis beautiful solitude.”\r\n\r\nI noticed now that my path was ascending a gently sloping hillock. I\r\nquickened my pace, for I was anxious to stand upon some elevation, so\r\nthat I could command a more extensive view of the outlying country.\r\n\r\nAs I gained the summit of the hillock, a scene of indescribable beauty\r\nmet my gaze.\r\n\r\nAs far as the eye could reach I saw unrolled beneath me a landscape of\r\nsuch surpassing loveliness that I paused spell-bound. Imagine a valley\r\nshut in by wooded heights, through which a silvery stream courses\r\ntranquilly; here a forest giant spreads its far-reaching limbs, and\r\nthere a clump of fruit trees display their load of golden treasures in\r\nthe sunlight; on this side flowering shrubs shine white as ivory against\r\nthe dark greensward, on that with trailing vines and trimmed copses,\r\nman’s hand has built many a shady bower of fantastic outline; to this\r\nadd scores of statues posed in every conceivable attitude of grace and\r\nbeauty—here a group, there a single figure, and farther on by twos and\r\nthrees, standing, reclining, sitting, at play, in meditation, listening,\r\nreading, thrumming stringed instruments, in attitudes of the chase,\r\ncasting the quoit, or reaching up to pluck fruit or flowers.\r\n\r\n“Is this a dream?” I murmured. “Am I not the sport of some mischievous\r\nspirit of the place?”\r\n\r\nFrom this deep reverie the loud barking of Bulger aroused me with\r\nshock-like violence.\r\n\r\nI looked in the direction of the sound.\r\n\r\nPoor, foolish dog, he was gamboling about one of the statues and amusing\r\nhimself in waking the echoes with his voice.\r\n\r\nI was a little nettled by the interruption, and called to him to cease\r\nhis barking.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me almost a sacrilege to disturb the deep repose of this\r\nfair valley.\r\n\r\nAgain the barking broke forth. This time Bulger’s strange antics were\r\nwilder than before.\r\n\r\nHe seemed fairly beside himself bounding around and around the statue\r\nwhich was that of a young man in the act of reaching aloft for fruit or\r\nflowers—and giving vent to a sort of half anger, half mischief, in a\r\nseries of barks, growls and whinings. Rare indeed was it that Bulger did\r\nnot give heed to my wishes, no matter how faintly expressed, but now,\r\nnot even a threatening tone of voice seemed to have the slightest effect\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nHe continued his mad gamboling and sharp, angry barking. Determined to\r\nreproach him most severely for his disobedience, I strode angrily toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI drew near.\r\n\r\nI looked! I saw!\r\n\r\nAshes of my forefathers, what? The statue had wide-opened eyes. The\r\nstatue had the blush of life on its cheeks.\r\n\r\nMotion, movement, even to a hair’s breadth, there was none! And yet\r\nthese fair blue eyes were bent upon Bulger in half-inquisitive,\r\nhalf-wondering gaze.\r\n\r\nI rubbed my eyes and looked again.\r\n\r\nI took a step forward.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a wave of fear crept over me like the flow of icy water. Would\r\nthe living marble, as it warmed to life, moved by some long pent-up\r\npassions, raise its hand and strike me dead?\r\n\r\nGathering myself together, I glanced toward a group of maidens at play\r\nbeneath the shade of a leafy roof of arched branches and interlacing\r\nvines.\r\n\r\nQuicker than it takes to tell it, I sprang forward and fixed my gaze\r\nupon their faces.\r\n\r\nDeath could not hold the human form in attitude more motionless than\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nAnd yet their eyes were filled with strange light.\r\n\r\nUpon their fair faces the red tint of life glowed, bright and warm!\r\n\r\nWhere was I?\r\n\r\nA strange feeling of half dread, half delight, now swept over me.\r\n\r\nAnd still I dared not speak. My voice will break the spell by which all\r\nthese breathing children of earth’s flinty breast keep their hold on\r\nlife, and they will fade away to nothingness.\r\n\r\nAnd now the eyes of her nearest me—of deeper black than polished coal,\r\nappeared bent full upon me. I could see, I thought, the glisten of those\r\nebon orbs, as if a tear had broken over them.\r\n\r\nHer hand was outstretched.\r\n\r\nWhat if I touch it, thought I, to see if it have the warmth of life\r\nwithin it, or whether it be not in truth a thing of stone, and I the\r\nsport of some mischievous spirit of the island?\r\n\r\nI’ll do it, if I’m slain like a poor worm, which, warmed by an\r\napproaching flame crawls to meet it.\r\n\r\nI touched its finger-tips!\r\n\r\nO, wondrous thing!\r\n\r\nThey were not of stone, but of softest, warmest flesh!\r\n\r\nI staggered back, expecting to see the group vanish in thin air.\r\n\r\nBut no; it moved not.\r\n\r\nIt stood as motionless as before!\r\n\r\nAnd now I felt my limbs grow strong beneath me.\r\n\r\nI determined to speak, come evil or come good!\r\n\r\nFixing my gaze upon their fair young faces, I uncovered and addressed\r\nthem thus:\r\n\r\n“O, strange and mysterious beings, resent not this bold intrusion of a\r\npuny mortal upon your sacred repose! Speak to me! If ye so will, let me\r\ntake my feet off the soil of your fair island. But ere I go, speak to\r\nme, let me know whether ye be not the creations of some spirit of this\r\nisle, or whether ye are really living, breathing beings!”\r\n\r\nNo sound issued from those rosy lips, parted as if in the very act of\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nNo movement, no tremor, came to break the marble-like pose of these fair\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nA whole minute elapsed.\r\n\r\nTo me it seemed an eternity.\r\n\r\nI stood riveted to the ground in most anxious suspense.\r\n\r\nThe minutes dragged their heavy bodies along one after another.\r\n\r\nBut joy unutterable!\r\n\r\nTheir lips begin to move.\r\n\r\nA smile, almost imperceptible at first, spreads slowly, slowly, over\r\ntheir faces.\r\n\r\nThe crimson of their cheeks takes on a deeper hue.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes bend a most sweet and friendly look upon me.\r\n\r\nThe word “we” falls gently on my ear.\r\n\r\nAnother pause!\r\n\r\nI lean forward, in most painful suspense, to catch the next faint\r\nsyllable.\r\n\r\nIt came at last.\r\n\r\n“Live!”\r\n\r\n“They live!” I cried in a loud and joyous voice, “they live! I am not\r\nthe sport of any strange divinity. These figures are not cold and\r\nsenseless marble, but warm-blooded, breathing, thinking, living beings!”\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you the depth of my satisfaction that this discovery was\r\nmade by my loved Bulger. He saw the terrible perplexity which had come\r\nupon his master, and hastened to his rescue; not frowning face, not\r\nthreatening voice was sufficient to turn him from his purpose of letting\r\nlight in upon my darkened mind. In my deep contrition, I could scarcely\r\nbring myself to speak his name.\r\n\r\nI felt how unworthy of his love I was.\r\n\r\nBut he pardoned me with a nobility of character more than human and\r\nspake his forgiveness by covering my hands with caresses and uttering a\r\nseries of soft low barks.\r\n\r\nWith Bulger by my side, I now mingled with these flesh and blood\r\ncompanions of the island’s marble dwellers, passing from one group to\r\nanother in speechless wonderment. Ay, in good faith they were alive, but\r\nnot more so than the flowers, the shrubs, the trees, the vines which\r\nhelped to make up the lovely scene of which they were the brightest and\r\nfairest ornaments.\r\n\r\nThe vines moved from place to place more rapidly than they, the flowers\r\noped their buds more quickly than the maidens did their lips. Like\r\nbeautiful figures of wax, moved by the slow uncoiling of some hidden\r\nspring, these living statues passed hours, nay days, in rising to their\r\nfeet or sinking down upon the velvety greensward.\r\n\r\nFor several hours I stood watching the white hand of a maiden as it\r\nreached forward, with imperceptible motion to pluck a red-cheeked peach\r\nwhich hung beside her. A full hour went by ere those delicate fingers\r\nwere clasped around the peach, another ere it had been carried to her\r\nlips. There, all day long, she held it pressed, but as the sun went down\r\nbehind the wooded hills, it fell from her loosened grasp and rolled\r\ntowards my feet. I slowly stooped, for I was not long in discovering\r\nthat my quick movements pained these animated statues, and picked it up.\r\nI could feel that some of the pulp had been drawn from the luscious\r\nfruit, but the skin was hardly broken, so gently had she fed upon it.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, seeing a smile upon the face of one of the maiden’s I\r\nturned to find upon whom she bent her gaze.\r\n\r\nIt was a handsome youth, who stood, perhaps fifty feet distant, with his\r\neyes fixed beamingly upon the maiden’s.\r\n\r\n“Surely” thought I, “affection will, as in other lands, quicken their\r\nmovements; they will advance toward each other somewhat rapidly now.”\r\n\r\nBut no, the long twilight yielded little by little to the deeper\r\nshadows; night came; the moon set her glowing disc in the heavens, and\r\nyet that youth was not near enough to clasp the hand of the maiden he\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nFrom the first coming of the twilight, smiles had been slowly gathering\r\nupon the faces of the other youths and maidens, whose eyes were turned\r\nupon the lovers.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a gentle “ha!” fell upon my ear, and, after the lapse of\r\nhalf an hour, another and louder “ha!” followed it, to be, after a still\r\nlonger pause, followed by still another “ha!” This last “ha!” was\r\nlengthened out into a clear and ringing note which lasted several\r\nseconds. Then it grew fainter and fainter, and died away like a spent\r\necho. Their mirth was over.\r\n\r\nAs I was threading my way among these living statues, one morning, I\r\ncame upon a group of children at play.\r\n\r\nAt first I could not see that they had noticed my coming at all, but\r\nafter the lapse of a quarter of an hour I discovered that their large\r\nbeautifully clear eyes were slowly turning toward me, so I determined to\r\nsit down near by and observe them. Fancy my delight upon finding that a\r\ndelicate thread-like flowering vine had twined around and around the\r\nbody of a little golden-haired maid of about seven, encircled her neck\r\nwith its many colored leaves and coral berries, and coiled itself like a\r\ncrown of gold and crimson upon her soft ringlets, dropping its blossoms\r\nand tendrils gently down around her head and shoulders.\r\n\r\nSeeing my astonishment, and hearing my words of delight, a mild-faced\r\nwoman seated near me slowly, slowly raised her hands and extended her\r\nfingers to make me understand that these little cherubs had been ten\r\ndays at play there upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“This beautiful vine,” thought I, “has joined in their sport. As much\r\nalive as they, it is in truth one of their playmates, and has wound\r\nitself lovingly around the child seated nearest to it.”\r\n\r\nI looked again. Lo! a tree loaded with delicious nuts was swinging in\r\nthe breeze and shaking them into the laps of these children at play,\r\nwhile on the other side, a tall, graceful plant bearing cup-shaped\r\nflowers of sunny whiteness, each of which I noticed was filled with\r\nlimpid water, drops of which sparkled in the sunlight like polished\r\ngems, gently brushed against the cheek of a smiling boy, as if to say:\r\n\r\n“Drink, dear little brother!”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful!” cried I, “these happy creatures, these trees and flowers,\r\nthese fruits and vines are all children of the same family. No storms\r\never come to darken these fair skies. Eternal spring reigns here. By\r\ndaylight, starlight and moonlight their lives flow gently along like\r\nsome broad, silvery stream, whose motion is too slow for human eye to\r\nnote it. Mysterious people! How shall I fathom the wonderful secret of\r\nyour existence? How shall I read the history of a people whose only\r\nbooks are speechless brooks and silent groves, whose tongues have so\r\nlost their power to interpret thought that months might go by and yet\r\nthe mystery remain unsolved!”\r\n\r\nAfter a sojourn of a few days among the “Slow Movers,” as I shall call\r\nthem, I made a discovery which alarmed me greatly.\r\n\r\nI found that this mysterious silence, this strange fate which cast me\r\namong living creatures with whom converse was next to impossible, this\r\nutter inability to distinguish the living statues from the marble ones,\r\nwas beginning to prey upon my mind.\r\n\r\nBulger noticed my ever-increasing melancholy, and exerted himself to\r\namuse and comfort me.\r\n\r\nI responded but poorly to his thousand and one cunning tricks and\r\nlaughable antics.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I felt that my mind was gradually yielding to some dread\r\ninfluence which pervaded the very air, and which, even hour by hour, so\r\ngained in strength that I realized the necessity of making a superhuman\r\neffort to break away from the power it had already acquired over me, or\r\nelse become myself a living statue and brother to the forms of flesh and\r\nmarble which inhabited this wonderland.\r\n\r\nI will not weary my readers with minute details of the plan which I had\r\nconceived to end the danger which threatened me, to snatch myself from\r\nthe living death which I could already feel creeping over me.\r\n\r\nIn my despair I determined to apply to the oldest of the Slow Movers,\r\nand throw myself upon his mercy, so to speak, to tell him of my longing\r\nto escape from the terrible fate threatening me, to return home to my\r\nbeloved parents, who would go down in sorrow to their graves if I, their\r\nsole child, their pride and their hope, should never come again to\r\ngladden their old age.\r\n\r\nBut more than this, I determined if possible, to learn the history of\r\nthe island and its mysterious folk, and to that end I resolved to\r\nbeseech him to indicate to me where I might find some record of their\r\npast, some book or parchment, so that I might not go through life\r\nburdened with the brain-racking thought that I had been powerless to\r\nsolve this mystery—a thought, which, if it did not shorten my days,\r\nwould most surely embitter them.\r\n\r\nAs I have already explained, in attempting to converse with the Slow\r\nMovers I was confronted with a two-fold difficulty. In the first place,\r\nthough I might burst with impatience, yet must I preserve a perfectly\r\ncalm and placid exterior, and, in the second place, when, after the long\r\nand wearying delay, it came my turn to make reply, that reply must not\r\nexceed the snail’s pace of the Slow Movers’ speech, else their bright\r\neyes clouded up and they seemed absolutely paralyzed by the rapidity of\r\nmy utterance. Their eye-lids sank slowly down and they seemed to fall\r\ninto a deep slumber, out of which it took hours to arouse them.\r\n\r\nAt the first streak of dawn I sought out the aged Slow Mover, whom I had\r\noften noted in his leafy temple, seated on a marble pediment his eyes\r\nfixed on the silent stream which bathed the very roots of the trees,\r\nwhose wide-spreading branches helped to roof over his habitation.\r\n\r\nAll that day and the starry night which followed it, I sat at his feet.\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself my utter despair at learning that not a word or a\r\nline, not a leaf or a parchment, was in existence, which, might end my\r\nfearful anxiety. I say fearful, for stronger and stronger, hour by hour,\r\ngrew the impulse to put an end to this life of useless, senseless\r\nactivity and join the throng of living statues into whose heart no vain\r\nregrets came to darken their placid dream-life.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the second day a thought burst upon my mind. It was\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nPerchance there may dwell, somewhere on this isle, some one living\r\ncreature, who, unlike his brothers, may possess the power of rapid\r\nspeech, whose tongue, for some reason or other, may have stayed\r\nloosened.\r\n\r\nI reasoned thus: In every land there were opposites, good and bad,\r\nbeautiful and ugly, graceful and awkward, swift and slow. Surely on this\r\nisle must live such contrasts as these. True, it may be an exception;\r\nbut it would be most wonderful if it did not exist.\r\n\r\nAll that day I spent in imparting unto the aged Slow Mover my train of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIt was deep in the twilight ere I had succeeded in putting the question\r\nto him: Whether there was not some living creature dwelling on this\r\nisland whose powers of speech were more like mine, and to whom I might,\r\nin my ever increasing dread of transformation into a Slow Mover, flee\r\nfor refuge from myself, for satisfaction of the irresistible longing\r\npressing on my very soul.\r\n\r\nBut the shades of evening were not so deep that I could not note the\r\ndarker shadow which began to gather on the face of the aged Slow Mover\r\nwhen I had completed my question.\r\n\r\nI was startled.\r\n\r\nSo violent were the beatings of my heart that they sounded loud, though\r\nmuffled, above the sighing of the zephyr, the rustle of the leaves, the\r\nplaintive warbling of the nightingale.\r\n\r\nAs this shadow went on growing, ever deeper and deeper, on the old man’s\r\nvisage, I felt that I had touched some ancient wound, which, though\r\nlong-forgotten, now bled afresh.\r\n\r\nHis lips parted, his head sank slowly, slowly, a sigh came forth, so\r\nfull of meaning, so like a tale-bearer of some long hidden sorrow, that\r\nI feared for the worst.\r\n\r\nMy limbs stiffened.\r\n\r\nI could feel the blood lessen its pace in my veins and go groping along\r\nas if uncertain of its way.\r\n\r\nI pressed the tips of my fingers to my cheeks. They were cold as\r\npolished marble.\r\n\r\nI essayed to speak. The words would not come.\r\n\r\nAt last I made a violent effort—\r\n\r\n“Bulger!” I whispered.\r\n\r\nPoor dog, he slept at my feet.\r\n\r\nI struggled to escape the spell for one brief moment, that I might stoop\r\nto give my faithful friend a farewell caress.\r\n\r\nHist!\r\n\r\nThe Slow Mover spoke.\r\n\r\n“Son!”\r\n\r\nI was saved!\r\n\r\nHe had aught to say to me.\r\n\r\nThe spell was broken.\r\n\r\nMy heart began to beat again; the warm blood ran tingling through my\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nIt was a narrow escape.\r\n\r\nAlready my finger tips had cooled.\r\n\r\nAnother moment and I would have joined the throng of Slow Movers, and\r\nbecome a brother to the marble dwellers on the Sculptors’ Isle.\r\n\r\nAll that night the aged Slow Mover talked to me. And when the sun went\r\nup I knew all. I knew the secret which had so darkened his placid\r\ncountenance. I knew the cave in which dwelt the hermit of the Sculptors’\r\nIsle—an outcast, a prisoner, shut in between the narrow walls of a\r\ncavern by the sea, for no fault of his, for no sin, for no wrong.\r\n\r\nNature had so willed it.\r\n\r\nWhy, the aged Slow Mover knew not.\r\n\r\nAntonius was the name which the hermit bore.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came I sought him out.\r\n\r\nI found him seated by his cavern’s portal, looking out upon the glory of\r\nthe eastern sky.\r\n\r\nThis was the secret of his exile:\r\n\r\nSome cruel fate had, in his youth, visited him with a dread disease, not\r\nunlike that which is known as St. Vitus’ dance. When the fit was upon\r\nhim, not only did he lose all control over his limbs, so that his feet\r\nbore him whither he willed not to go, and that, too, with extreme\r\nrapidity, but his arms likewise executed the most rapid and vigorous\r\ngestures, now in apparent anger, now entreaty, now wonder. You will\r\nreadily understand why ill-fated Antonius came to be banished from the\r\nmidst of the Slow Movers.\r\n\r\nAlthough their brother, and deeply beloved of them, his lightning-like\r\nrapidity of motion, his violent gestures, his almost ceaseless change of\r\nattitude, not only offended the Slow Movers, it dazed them; it shocked\r\nthem; it checked the sluggish flow of life blood within their veins, and\r\nthreatened them all with slow but certain death.\r\n\r\nHe must go!\r\n\r\nHe did!\r\n\r\nAntonius was banished to the cavern by the sea, where never came sound,\r\nsave the ocean’s roar when lashed by the demons of the gale, or its sad\r\nmurmur and ceaseless break and splash in its moments of slumber and\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nBut, most terrible of all the manifestations of the unfortunate\r\nAntonius’ fearful ailment was the utterly wild and ungovernable rapidity\r\nof his speech.\r\n\r\nLike maddened steeds, tongue and lips rushed along!\r\n\r\nTo the eyes and ears of the Slow Movers, such a violently expressive\r\nface, such mad rapidity of utterance, were death itself!\r\n\r\nNot one brief month would have found a living statue in that home of\r\nflinty hearts, had Antonius not gone!\r\n\r\nAntonius was thankful for that dread decree, which housed him forever in\r\nthe cavern by the sea!\r\n\r\nHe saw the sufferings of his people, and though his eyes in that brief\r\ntime wept more tears than all his brethren ever had shed in their\r\nsluggish lives, yet were they but a poor proof of the awful grief he\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nAntonius turned towards me as I approached the spot where he sat wrapped\r\nin deep meditation. A sad, but withal kindly smile flitted about his\r\nlips, like the quick but faint glimmer of the lightning in the distant\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nHe rose.\r\n\r\nI paused to await his bidding to approach him.\r\n\r\nHe spake not a word, but stretched out his hand.\r\n\r\nI bounded forward to clasp it and press it to my lips.\r\n\r\nAt that instant the fit fell on him.\r\n\r\nI could see the look of pain which flashed across his face.\r\n\r\nAway he glided, now backward, now forward, now sidewise, now obliquely,\r\nhis hand outstretched in a desperate effort to reach me, who, with equal\r\ndesperation, advanced and retreated in a mad endeavor to grasp what\r\nconstantly eluded me.\r\n\r\nBulger utterly unable to comprehend this wild dance among the rocks of\r\nthat cavernous shore, followed my heels barking furiously.\r\n\r\nI could take no time to quiet him.\r\n\r\nAway, away, sped Antonius with redoubled speed, his right hand extended\r\ntoward me as if with a pitiful prayer to grasp it and thus end the fit\r\nwhich was shaking his limbs so furiously.\r\n\r\nPausing to catch my breath, I again pursued the flitting figure with a\r\ndetermination to overtake it or perish in the attempt.\r\n\r\nAt last it seemed to circle in smaller and ever smaller rings.\r\n\r\nNow was my time!\r\n\r\nI sprang upon that whirling form, with a sort of mad desperation, to\r\nseize and hold its outstretched hand.\r\n\r\nAt length I held it.\r\n\r\nBut no!\r\n\r\nHis body had come to a rest, but now high over my head, now at my feet,\r\nnow flashing up one side, now down the other, now whizzing in front of\r\nmy eyes, now encircling my head like a bird in swift flight that hand\r\nwent on, ever on, in its wild and mysterious course!\r\n\r\nMy strength was failing me!\r\n\r\nShall I ever be able to grasp it!\r\n\r\nAntonius, too, showed signs of yielding to the awful power of the dread\r\ndisease which tormented him!\r\n\r\nHis face took on a strange pallor! His breast heaved convulsively. With\r\none last despairing effort I succeeded in catching his hand in its\r\nflight around my head!\r\n\r\nI clung to it with desperate vigor!\r\n\r\nMy touch dispelled the venom from his veins.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to awake as from some awful dream. He passed his hand across\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\nStill clinging to his hand, I gently forced him to be seated upon a\r\nrocky bench, over which the ocean had woven a velvety covering of\r\nsea-grass and weeds.\r\n\r\n“Antonius!” I cried, “peace come upon thee! Forget thy suffering. Be as\r\nthou once wert! My touch can give thee rest at least for a brief\r\nrespite!”\r\n\r\nHe pressed my hand. A deep sigh lifted his breast. It was the last gasp\r\nof the demon which oppressed him.\r\n\r\nHe was now at rest.\r\n\r\nTo me his utterance was rapid but not more so than that of many quick\r\nthinkers with whom I had conversed.\r\n\r\n“What wouldst thou?” said he, in a low but strangely sweet, mild voice.\r\n\r\nI unfolded to him the object of my coming.\r\n\r\nI went back to the finding of the Roman newspaper and my departure from\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAll, all; I told him all; how I had come into the home of the Slow\r\nMovers, how I had mistaken them for marble like the rest of the figures\r\nabout the island, how I longed to have the mystery cleared up.\r\n\r\nAll that day Antonius and I sat by the sea in most delightful converse.\r\n\r\nOnly once, at high noon, did he set a brief limit to his tale while we\r\npassed into his cavern to partake of food and drink.\r\n\r\nWith a high-bounding heart, I listened to his story of the landing of\r\nthe Seven Sculptors upon the isle. Their first task had been to rear the\r\nglorious temple with its long flight of marble steps leading down to the\r\nsea. Then they, and, later, their sons, and their sons’ sons, had set to\r\nwork to people this beautiful island with almost countless figures of\r\nthe rarest grace and finish.\r\n\r\nIn the forests, by the river’s banks, through the valley, on the\r\nhillside, adown the terraces, to the very water’s edge, rose the\r\nfaultless statues in wondrous beauty and profusion.\r\n\r\nHere, there and everywhere, forms of matchless grace gleamed, snow-white\r\namid the leafy bowers or tangled underwood.\r\n\r\nA mysterious ardor burned within the hearts of these exiled artists. It\r\nwould seem that theirs was a wild sort of hope to rear on that\r\nfar-distant isle another Rome—an infant daughter, but fairer and whiter\r\nin her marble magnificence than the glorious mother who sate upon her\r\nseven hills!\r\n\r\nTimes and times again, aye, thrice three score and ten, the wretched\r\nPaula arose out of the quarried blocks, ever fair and ever fairer, now\r\nbent in awful grief, now putting the very skies to shame with the\r\nentrancing beauty of her upturned, pleading, sweet and pitiful face.\r\n\r\nHere and there, too, stood great Cæsar, never to be forgotten for his\r\ngodlike clemency in snatching the sculptors from terrible death.\r\n\r\nAs the second century of the exile dawned upon the little Roman Kingdom,\r\nfar away beneath the Southern skies, at the very moment when the colony\r\nwas waxing strong and vigorous a strange and mysterious thing happened\r\nto the dwellers in this island home of sweet content.\r\n\r\nNo more male children were born!\r\n\r\nThe seven sculptors, now bent with age, and their faces hollowed by the\r\nsharp chisels of remorse, went, one after the other to the dark realm of\r\nDeath.\r\n\r\nTheir sons, too, came into ripe manhood. And their sons grew up, happy\r\nin the possession of that glorious talent which had peopled the isle\r\nwith such matchless forms of beauty.\r\n\r\nBut now the race had reached the end of its long reign in the world of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nDecade after decade slipped away, and still there came not one male\r\nchild to gladden a sculptor’s home.\r\n\r\nA sort of blank despair sank upon the colony.\r\n\r\nThe elder sculptors laid their chisels down in utter hopelessness.\r\n\r\nEven the younger wrought less and less.\r\n\r\nStill there came no boy to wake the old-time song and laughter of that\r\nonce joyous island home.\r\n\r\nFingers cunning in art grew stiff with age.\r\n\r\nHearts full of glorious inspiration waxed dull and spiritless! One by\r\none they all went the way which mortal feet must tread.\r\n\r\nA terrible, a wonderful change came over the people.\r\n\r\nWeighed down by this leaden grief, surrounded day and night by these\r\nspeechless, motionless marble forms, which, although silent as the very\r\nclod itself, yet cried out unceasingly: “Give us more companions in\r\nthese solitudes!” these unfortunate people almost turned to marble\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThey became, in good sooth, brothers and sisters to the marble dwellers\r\non this island.\r\n\r\nAt length the end came!\r\n\r\nThe last sculptor was laid upon the carved bier of the great white\r\ntemple by the sea!\r\n\r\nA silence so long, so deep, so dreadful, fell upon the people that it\r\nalmost seemed their speech was lost forever.\r\n\r\nWithin the dark grottoes and bosky underwood, they crawled to hide away\r\nfrom the very light of day.\r\n\r\nTheir limbs, once so supple and elastic, ever ready to bear their owners\r\nover hill and across plain, delighting in the dance, inured to the race,\r\nnow became heavy and slow.\r\n\r\nThey seemed almost about to turn to stone, and join the silent company\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nIn good sooth, such a fate was imminent, when the happening of a joyful\r\nevent averted it.\r\n\r\nA year had passed since the last sculptor had gone to join the shadowy\r\ncaravan which moves forever across the desert of Eternal Silence, when\r\nhis seven sad-faced daughters were fairly startled by an infant’s cry.\r\n\r\nBut look!\r\n\r\nTheir widowed mother stands before them with a babe nestled in her arms.\r\n\r\nIt is a son!\r\n\r\nThe joyful tidings can only creep from family to family.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was too late to call them back to old-time customs and habits,\r\ntoo late to start their blood again in old-time bounding, leaping course\r\nthrough their veins.\r\n\r\nThey were a changed people!\r\n\r\nTrue, their happiness came again, but it was not the same. They could\r\nsmile and laugh, but it was scarcely more than faces of marble moved by\r\nsome mysterious power. They could talk, but so slowly fell the words\r\nthat it almost seemed some statue spoke amid the leafy coverts of the\r\nisland. They could move, but snail or tortoise outstripped them with\r\nease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMARKABLE BEHAVIOR OF A BUST OF CÆSAR IN THE LAND OF THE\r\nSLOW MOVERS.]\r\n\r\nAy, they were changed indeed; fated henceforth to people their beautiful\r\nisland home with living statues.\r\n\r\nFor years in long flight sped away, till one century followed another,\r\nand yet the wondrous talent came back no more.\r\n\r\nIt was lost forever!\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, too, the people forgot the story of their fathers.\r\n\r\nIt is kept alive in the hearts of a few chosen ones, and they hand it\r\ndown, each quarter century, to younger keepers selected for the purpose.\r\n\r\nTo Antonius the secret had been thus confided.\r\n\r\nAnd such was the tale he told to me!\r\n\r\nWith a light heart, now that its weight of doubt and uncertainty had\r\nbeen lifted from it, I bade Antonius farewell, and, followed by Bulger\r\nwended my way back to the abodes of the Slow Movers.\r\n\r\nAs I passed through one of the groves peopled with marble forms, I\r\npaused, I hardly knew why, in front of an admirable bust of the great\r\nCæsar.\r\n\r\nBulger joined me, and there we stood, children of this late day, with\r\nour eyes uplifted to the face of him whose smallest word was once copied\r\ndown on waxen tablet as if it were the utterance of a god.\r\n\r\nI had always liked Cæsar.\r\n\r\nWe resembled each other in many ways.\r\n\r\nWe were both men of action.\r\n\r\nI felt sorry for him now, that he should be forced to live, even in the\r\nshape of marble, among such dull and inactive people as the Slow Movers.\r\n\r\nI told him so.\r\n\r\n“And yet, Julius,” said I, “called of men the Great Cæsar, what a\r\nfortunate thing it is that thou art not living now, for thou wouldst be\r\novercome with shame at finding everybody reading my adventures while the\r\nbook which thou wrotest concerning Gaul lies mouldy and dust-covered on\r\nthe shelves of the libraries!”\r\n\r\nThe following day, in passing that way again, and glancing up at great\r\nCæsar’s face, I noticed that a smile had just started in the right\r\ncorner of his mouth. So stolid had he become through his long residence\r\namong the Slow Movers that he had just begun to be amused by the remark\r\nI had made on the previous day.\r\n\r\nThoughts of home now arose in my mind.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that shortly after my interview with Antonius in his cavern\r\nby the sea, Bulger had commenced to show unmistakable signs of\r\nhome-sickness. So I dispatched him with a note to the officer of my\r\nvessel to begin preparations at once for the return voyage.\r\n\r\nBulger made haste to execute the commission.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to the foot of the marble staircase, and then by loud\r\nbarking attracted the attention of the officer whom I had left in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nHe sent a boat ashore and Bulger met it with my letter in his mouth.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I would have fain lingered for a week or so longer\r\namong the Slow Movers, but it was plain to be seen that they were\r\ngrowing restive at my presence.\r\n\r\nOn the cheeks of many of them all signs of ruddy peach-bloom had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nDay by day they grew more and more like their marble brethren.\r\n\r\nMy quick movements so wearied their eyes that after a few hours’ stay in\r\ntheir midst I found myself surrounded by a company of deep sleepers.\r\n\r\nNor dared I speak.\r\n\r\nFor no matter how I softened my voice, or how slowly I uttered my words,\r\nthey jarred upon the delicate ears of the Slow Movers, and signs of\r\nsuffering gradually passed over their faces.\r\n\r\nMy resolution was therefore quickly formed.\r\n\r\nWith a snail’s pace I passed from group to group, from bower to bower,\r\nfrom grove to grove, saying in a soft and measured tone: “Fare——well!\r\nFare——well!”\r\n\r\nThen I directed my steps toward the white temple by the sea, for I knew\r\nmy boat’s crew were waiting for me at the foot of the marble staircase.\r\n\r\nAs I passed in front of Great Cæsar’s statue I turned to wave a last\r\nadieu.\r\n\r\nWhat saw I, think you?\r\n\r\nWhy, that same smile which had begun in the right corner of his mouth\r\nseveral days ago, had crossed over to the other side of his face and was\r\njust at the left corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\nOn the right side, whence it had come, all was as stern and calm as when\r\nhe sat enthroned at Rome, and ruled the world.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later, as we were busy setting the sails of my good ship\r\nthere fell upon my ear in a soft, echo-like tone, the word.\r\n\r\n“Fare!”\r\n\r\nThe Slow Movers had begun to speak their adieu. The winds were\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\nThe sails filled.\r\n\r\nAs the sun went down, pouring a flood of golden light upon the beautiful\r\nmarble staircase, the great white temple and the many snowy statues\r\nwhich gleamed so bright and fair amid the dark foliage of the trees and\r\nvines upon the terraces of that mysterious island I threw myself upon\r\nthe deck with intent to keep my eyes fixed upon the lovely scene as long\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nMy good ship sailed away in deepest silence. For I had given orders that\r\nno one should speak above a whisper.\r\n\r\nNow the Sculptors’ Isle had faded to a mere speck in the horizon, and\r\nnow, in the gathering shades of night, it was swallowed up, and lost\r\nforever!\r\n\r\nMy heart grew heavy.\r\n\r\nBulger nestled his head in my lap, with his loving eyes fixed full upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\nSleep overcame us both.\r\n\r\nThe sky was star-studded when we awoke.\r\n\r\nThe cool night wind had refreshed me.\r\n\r\nI sprang up with the intention of going below. At that instant there\r\ncame floating along on the evening breeze, like a mountain echo nearly\r\nspent, a soft mysterious sound.\r\n\r\nMy ear caught it! It was:\r\n\r\n“W—e l—l!”\r\n\r\nThe Slow Movers had finished speaking their adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  Once more I grow tired of the quiet pleasures of home.

And at dinner she took care to place a professor\r\nor, some learned person beside me, so that I might not find myself\r\ncondemned to silence for the want of a gifted mind to measure mental\r\nswords with.\r\n\r\nBut all to no purpose. I grew daily more taciturn, absent-minded, and\r\nplunged into meditation. With my eyes fixed upon vacancy, I sat like one\r\nwith unbalanced mind amidst the lightest-hearted merry-makers. In vain\r\nthe company besought me to relate past adventures, to tell them tales\r\nalready thrice told. I only shook my head with a mournful smile, and\r\nmade good my escape from scenes which were painful to me.\r\n\r\nBulger felt that his little master was suffering, and coaxed with\r\nplaintive whining to have me make known to him the cause of my grief.\r\n\r\nHis joy was wild and boisterous when he saw my body-servant enter my\r\napartments, bearing an empty traveling chest upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, life at the baronial hall pleased Bulger not a whit\r\nmore than it did me.\r\n\r\nThe house dogs annoyed him with their attentions, and he was wont to\r\nretire from the dining hall with a look of utter disgust upon his face,\r\nwhen one of the family cats, in the most friendly spirit, drew near and\r\ntasted a bit of his dinner.\r\n\r\nAll caresses, too, from other hands than mine were distasteful to him;\r\nand, although for my sake he would permit the gracious baroness to\r\nstroke his silken ears, yet any familiarity on the part of the elder\r\nbaron was firmly, but respectfully, declined.\r\n\r\nThe very moment I saw my chests placed here and there in my apartments,\r\nmy spirits rose. I became like another being. The color returned to my\r\ncheeks, the gleam to my eye, the old-time ring to my voice.\r\n\r\nFrom lip to lip, the word was passed: “The little baron is making ready\r\nfor another journey!”\r\n\r\nFrom early morn to deepening shadows of twilight, I busied myself with\r\nsuperintending the packing of my boxes. It was a labor of love with me.\r\n\r\nI never was born for a calm life beneath the time-stained tiles of\r\npaternal halls! My heart was filled with redder, warmer blood than\r\nordinary mortals. My brain never slept. Night and day, shadowy forms of\r\nmen and things, strange and curious, swept along before me in\r\nnever-ending files.\r\n\r\nOne morning, while at work with my boxes, a low knock at my chamber door\r\nfell upon my ear. Bulger, scenting an enemy, gave a low growl. I swung\r\nthe door open. It was the elder baron.\r\n\r\n“Honored father,” I cried gayly, “act as if thou wert master here! Be\r\nsad, be gay; sit, stand, drink, eat, or fast!”\r\n\r\n“Little baron,” began my father in a solemn voice, “I beseech thee give\r\nover thy jesting. When thou hast heard the object of my visit, grief\r\nwill chase every vestige of mirth from thy light heart.”\r\n\r\n“Speak baron!”\r\n\r\n“Art thou a dutiful and loving son?” asked my father, fixing his dark,\r\nmournful eyes full upon me.\r\n\r\n“I am!”\r\n\r\n“’Tis well!” he replied, “then arrest this making ready to abandon thy\r\nparents in their hour of misfortune. Put an end to all this unseemly\r\nhurlyburly, and to thy longing to be gone from beneath the paternal\r\nroof.”\r\n\r\nThe clouded face, trembling and tear-filled eyes of the elder baron\r\nshocked me. I could feel the blood leaving my cheeks, where, till then,\r\nit had bloomed like the glow of ripening fruit.\r\n\r\nBut I checked myself; and, motioning the baron to be seated, said in a\r\ncalm—though spite of me—trembling voice:\r\n\r\n“Noble father, it is thine to command; mine to obey! Speak, I pray thee,\r\nand speak too, plainly—if need be, harshly. Bare thy most secret\r\nthoughts. What aileth thee? What sends these dark shadows to rest on\r\nthat calm, smooth brow?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, little baron,” was my father’s reply, “for thy promise of\r\nobedience. This is the weight which presses on my heart: Since thou hast\r\ntaken up this rambling, roving life, robbed of thy counsel and\r\nco-operation, I have seen our ancestral estate hastening to ruin. Last\r\nyear our tenantry scarcely harvested enough to keep body and soul\r\ntogether. This year promises to turn out worse yet. Desolation sits upon\r\nthe broad acres once the prize of our family! Crops fail, grass withers,\r\ntrees turn yellow! The poor cattle moan for sustenance as they winder\r\nabout in the dried-up pastures. I look upon all this wreck and ruin, but\r\nam helpless as a babe to stay it! Speak, my son; wilt thou, hast thou\r\nthe heart, canst thou be so cruel as to turn thy back upon these pitiful\r\nscenes without raising thy hand to avert the impending doom?”\r\n\r\n“Baron!” I interposed mildly, but firmly, “facts first! eloquence\r\nthereafter! Impart unto me, in plain, King’s speech, the cause of all\r\nthis ruin! What hath wrought it? What hath desolated our fair fields?\r\nWhat hath carried this rapine among our flocks and herds? Speak!”\r\n\r\n“I will, little baron, give attentive ear!” rejoined my father with\r\nstately bend of the body:\r\n\r\n“As ancient Egypt was visited with scourge and plague, so have been our\r\nancestral acres! In pasture and grain fields, myriads of moles feed upon\r\nthe tender rootlets; in grass lands, swarms of meadow-mice fatten on the\r\nherbage; in orchards and nurseries, countless numbers of\r\nground-squirrels spread destruction far and near! Such are the terrible\r\nscourges now laying waste our once fair estates, your pride and mine,\r\nand the envy of all beholders!\r\n\r\n“Little baron, I feel, I know that thou canst help me; that somewhere in\r\nthe vast storehouse of thy mind, rest plans and devices potent enough to\r\nrestore these broad lands to all their former beauty and\r\nproductiveness.”\r\n\r\n“Baron!” was my reply, “when was there a time that thou foundst me\r\nwanting in my duty to thee or lacking in power to assist thee?”\r\n\r\n“Never!” ejaculated the elder baron with great emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Then, betake thee to my gentle mother—the baroness—thy consort, comfort\r\nher. Bid her take heart! Say I will not go abroad until these pests are\r\ndriven from our ancestral domain!”\r\n\r\nThe elder baron rose. I accompanied him to the door, then, we saluted\r\neach other with dignity and he withdrew to bear the glad message of my\r\npromised assistance to my sorrowing mother.\r\n\r\nAlone in my apartments, a terrible feeling of disappointment came over\r\nme. I felt that it would be useless to continue in my preparations to\r\nleave home in the face of these dire misfortunes now threatening my\r\nfamily. For, as I reasoned—and I think with great clearness—the name of\r\nour family would dwindle to a shadow, were we robbed of these broad\r\nacres of pasture and meadow-land, forest and orchard.\r\n\r\nTo me, a landless nobleman had something very ludicrous about him; and I\r\nfully made up my mind that I would either save my ancestral estate from\r\nruin, or lay aside forever my title of baron, as a gem which had lost\r\nits radiance, even as a pearl, which the stolid rustic ruins for the\r\nsake of a meal of victuals!\r\n\r\nThat night I partook of no food, so that I might lie down with unclouded\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nBulger noticing this, concluded that his little master was ailing, and\r\nlikewise refused to touch food, although I ordered his favorite\r\ndish—roasted cocks’ combs—to be prepared.\r\n\r\nTill midnight I lay awake in deepest thought over the arduous task which\r\nconfronted me. At the stroke of twelve from the old clock on the stair,\r\nI determined to let my mind work out the problem itself, and turned over\r\nand went to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe baron and baroness entered the breakfast-room with unclouded brows\r\nthe next morning. I greeted them very cordially. The conversation was\r\nenlivened by one or two of the elder baron’s ancient anecdotes which he\r\nfurbished up for the occasion with several new characters and an\r\nentirely new ending. I laughed heartily—as I was in duty bound to do.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over Bulger and I sallied forth to begin work. I resolved to\r\nattack the moles first.\r\n\r\nTo get rid of pest number one was not at all a difficult matter for me,\r\nwhen once I set about thinking it over. In fact, I may say right here,\r\nthat this task, set me by the elder baron, would have been an impossible\r\none had it not been for my intimate acquaintance with the natures,\r\nhabits and peculiarities of animal life. Always a close student of\r\nnatural history there was little about the four-footed tenants of the\r\nfields which had escaped my observation.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Bulger; armed with a pair of short, wooden tongs; and\r\ncarrying a basket, I set out for the grain fields.\r\n\r\nBulger was in high glee for he had already made up his mind that there\r\nwas sport ahead for him.\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour, with him to point out their hiding places and to\r\nunearth them, I had captured a hundred moles. Returning to the\r\noverseer’s lodge, with his help I cut off the nails of each mole’s fore\r\nfeet close to the flesh and then gave orders to have the lot carried\r\nback to the grain fields and released. Turning my attention now to the\r\nmeadow-mice, I realized at once that to get rid of pest number two would\r\nbe the most difficult task of all.\r\n\r\nThe unthinking reader has doubtless already cried out in thought: “Why\r\nnot turn a troop of cats into the meadows, and let them make short work\r\nof the destructive little creatures?”\r\n\r\nAh how easy it is to plan, how difficult to execute! Know then, my\r\nclever friend, that the meadows were wet and that though often tried the\r\ncats absolutely refused to enter them.\r\n\r\nThe merest tyro in natural history is aware of a cat’s aversion to\r\nwetting its fur; and, above all, of stepping into water. Even moisture\r\nis disagreeable to a cat’s feet and she will willingly walk a mile\r\nrather than cross a plot of dew-moistened green sward. However, I\r\ndetermined to begin my operations at once.\r\n\r\nKnowing the wonderful changes which the pangs of hunger will work in an\r\nanimal’s nature, forcing the meat-eaters to turn to the herbage of the\r\nfield for sustenance—I hoped for favorable results.\r\n\r\nSelecting half a dozen vigorous young cats from the cottages of our\r\ntenantry, and providing myself with a lot of India rubber caps used for\r\ndrawing down over the necks of bottles, in order to make them air-tight,\r\nI proceeded to encase the legs of each cat in these coverings, cutting a\r\nhole in each one, however, so as to allow the paws to pass through. I\r\nwished to accustom them to these leggings before covering the feet\r\nentirely. My next step was to subject the cats to twenty-four hours\r\nfast. After which, I caused some of their favorite food—broiled fish to\r\nbe placed at the other end of a long room, covering the intervening\r\nspace with long-napped rugs, which I had first dipped into water.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their hunger, they absolutely refused to cross the dripping\r\nrugs.\r\n\r\nAdvancing to the edge, they tested the condition of the obstacles which\r\nblocked their advance upon the savory food feeling here and there for a\r\ndry spot; and then retreating with piteous mewing, as they shook the wet\r\nfrom their feet.\r\n\r\nDrawing the rubber caps completely over the feet of one of the cats, I\r\nnow placed her on the wet rug, encouraging her to remain there by\r\nfeeding her a few dainty bits of the fish. Finding that her feet did not\r\nget wet, she consented to walk here and there over the wet surface, in\r\norder to secure toothsome bits of food. I made the same experiment with\r\nthe other cats, and everything went as well as I could wish.\r\n\r\nThe next day I continued my instruction, and to my great joy, succeeded\r\nin schooling the whole lot, not only to make no objection to having\r\ntheir feet encased in the rubber boots, but even to wade through an inch\r\nor more of water, in order to secure a particularly dainty bit of food.\r\n\r\nI was now ready to make a practical test of my trained hunters.\r\n\r\nThe day preceding the trial they were again subjected to a prolonged\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nI must frankly confess that my heart beat rather nervously as I, with\r\nthe overseer and two other assistants set out for the low lands,\r\ncarrying the trained mousers—already shod in their rubber boots—in three\r\nbaskets.\r\n\r\nWe advanced cautiously upon the meadow-land, but so far as the mice were\r\nconcerned, our caution was useless, for they ran about under our very\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAs I stood gazing over the long stretch of devastated meadow-land, once\r\nso famous for its thick, velvety grass, the tears gathered in my eyes\r\nand my voice choked. Now or never, thought I, must the attempt be made\r\nto save these fair fields from utter ruin. At a wave of my hand, my\r\nassistants stooped and released the somewhat startled cats. They were\r\nnot long, however, in collecting their wits and getting ready for\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nSharp hunger is an excellent sauce! As the six monsters leaped among\r\nthose troops of tiny creatures—till that moment nibbling, playing or\r\nteasing one another, without a thought of harm or danger—the wildest\r\nconsternation seized upon them.\r\n\r\nNot only near by us, but as far as the eye could reach, panic and\r\ndisorder spread among these, till then peaceful little beings. Those\r\nwhich sought safety in their holes were hurled back by others rushing\r\nfrantically out into the open air.\r\n\r\nThe cats kept at their work like avenging furies. They killed for the\r\nmere pleasure of killing, passing like a death-dealing blast here and\r\nthere over the meadows.\r\n\r\nAfter the work of destruction had been kept up for half an hour, I\r\ndirected that the trained six should be carried back to their quarters,\r\nfor I was too good a general to let my troops get their fill of sack and\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\nThe next day another attack was made upon the enemy. The trained six, if\r\nanything, spread death right and left with greater fury than at first.\r\nThe wet lands no longer had any terrors for them. They splashed through\r\nthe puddles like mischievous boys through roadside brooks and ponds.\r\n\r\nI now bethought me of turning my attention to the ground squirrels. My\r\nfirst step was to send to town for several bushels of the smallest\r\nmarbles that could be purchased. Then, having, with the assistance of my\r\never-faithful and loving friend and helper—my dear, dumb brother\r\nBulger—located the whereabouts of several hundred burrows of the\r\nground-squirrels, I gave orders to have a half-dozen or more of the\r\nmarbles rolled down into each one of those holes.\r\n\r\nThese labors completed, I withdrew to my apartments and set about\r\namusing myself in several ways, while awaiting a report from the\r\noverseer.\r\n\r\nMany of the tenants who had watched my operations against the moles,\r\nmeadow-mice and ground-squirrels, even ventured openly to denounce them\r\nas “wild whims”, “a dreamer’s ideas” “silly workings of a diseased\r\nmind.”\r\n\r\nPoor creatures! They had lost their all. They had seen the labor of long\r\nweary months ruined by these pests. They were embittered and skeptical.\r\nI had not the heart to notice their rather impertinent utterances. While\r\nawaiting the developments, I plunged into the delights of some tales of\r\na bold traveler written in the ancient Assyrian tongue in the\r\nwedge-shaped letter.\r\n\r\nThree days went by and no news from the superintendent!\r\n\r\nTwo more, made five full days!\r\n\r\nOn the sixth came nothing.\r\n\r\nAt last, with the dawn of the seventh I was awakened by loud and long\r\ncontinued cheering beneath my windows. Springing from my bed and drawing\r\naside the curtains, I was astonished to see long lines of our tenantry,\r\nmen, women and children bearing banners, wreaths, garlands, etc.\r\n\r\nOne company of children carried long, thin rods from the end of which\r\ndangled dead moles, meadow-mice and ground-squirrels.\r\n\r\nThe moment I presented myself at the window, there was an outburst of\r\ncheering, so sturdy that the windows rattled before it. A tap at my door\r\ncalled me in another direction. It was the elder baron!\r\n\r\n“Haste! little baron!” he cried eagerly “descend to the castle platform,\r\nthe people are beside themselves with joy! Canst thou catch their cries?\r\nNot a mole, nor a mouse, nor a squirrel is alive on the broad acres of\r\nthy estate. I say “thy” because it is justly thine! Thou hast saved it\r\nfrom utter ruin. Henceforth for the few years which kind Providence may\r\nwill that I should tarry with thee, let it be as thy guest.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay, baron!” I replied laughingly, “that may not be! Till thou\r\nsleepest with the noble dead of our long and honored line, thou art\r\nmaster here!”\r\n\r\nI pressed his hand reverently to my lips and sent him to talk to the\r\npeople until I should be ready to take my place at his side.\r\n\r\nI can well fancy how impatient the reader is to hear something more\r\nabout the manner in which I rid my ancestral estate of these noisome\r\npests. With regard to the meadow-mice that needs no explanation, but,\r\nthe disappearance of the moles and ground-squirrels seems somewhat\r\nmysterious.\r\n\r\nWell and good. I’ll make it clear! Gentle reader, if you had been as\r\nclose a student of the natures and habits of these animals as I, you\r\ncould have done the same thing yourself. You must know, then, that the\r\nmole’s body bears about the same relation to his forefeet, as a boiler\r\ndoes to a steam engine, which is admirably adjusted in all its parts,\r\nworking smoothly and noiselessly, like a thing of life—polished and\r\nbeautiful in all its bearings and put together so skillfully that no\r\nhuman thought could better it. That is to say, the only wonderful thing\r\nabout a mole is his hand.\r\n\r\nThat is a delight to a student of natural history.\r\n\r\nI have sat for hours and studied the marvelous shape of this hand. And\r\nstrange though it may seem to you, no one knows better than the mole\r\nhimself, that therein lies his hold on life.\r\n\r\nYou’ll bear in mind, that I caused the nails to be clipped off the\r\nforefeet of the hundred moles, close to the flesh, and then turned them\r\nloose. In other words, without absolutely destroying their marvellous\r\nhands, I completely destroyed their usefulness.\r\n\r\nNow another thing you must be taught, that in the busy communities of\r\nthese little animals, there are no sluggards. Every one must work. Only\r\none thing stops him from using his hands.\r\n\r\nThat is death. When a mole sees his fellow stop work, he knows what has\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of the hundred captives to their burrows, there was joy\r\nmingled with terror!\r\n\r\nWhose turn might come next?\r\n\r\nBut, when the moment arrived to fall into line and set to work, there\r\nwas consternation!\r\n\r\nWhat! alive, and not able to dig?\r\n\r\nImmediately, the wildest panic seizes upon the community. They abandon\r\ntheir homes! With frantic haste, they pierce new burrows in every\r\ndirection, leaving their ill-fated companions behind them to die a\r\nlingering death—literally buried alive. Weeks, months will elapse ere\r\nthey recover from this wild fear. Then they will be miles away.\r\n\r\nAnd the ground-squirrels, you ask. The ground-squirrel is as conceited,\r\ninquisitive, persistent and hard-headed as he is hard-toothed. If he\r\nknew that the world was round he would claim that it was simply a huge\r\nnut and wish that he were big enough to get at its kernel.\r\n\r\nWhen the marbles first came rolling down his burrow, he was pleased.\r\nThey were so smooth, so round! He rolled them hither and thither, as\r\ncontent as a child with a new toy. Then he stored them away for another\r\nday’s amusement. Pretty soon he began to tire of them. They were\r\ndreadfully in his way. They annoyed him greatly. And yet, he couldn’t\r\nbear to think of parting with them. Finally the question arose in his\r\nmind: What are they, anyway? Surely they must have a kernel! And so he\r\nset to work gnawing upon them. They were terribly hard, but he was\r\ndetermined to get at the pit. Day after day, he kept at the thankless\r\ntask, gnawing, gnawing, until, one fine morning, he awoke to make the\r\nawful discovery that his teeth were gone!\r\n\r\nNow, a ground-squirrel may be said to consist of four teeth, and nothing\r\nelse. These gone there is no way to keep the other part alive.\r\n\r\nTrue, he may, after infinite labor struggle through a nutshell, but it\r\nis too slow work to keep up his strength. Every nut becomes a harder\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was with the vast colony in our orchards. The first few days\r\nquite a number made their appearance as usual. Then, fewer and fewer\r\ncame out of their holes, and they looked thin and feeble and showed no\r\ninclination to gambol and chatter. At the end of the week, the work was\r\ndone. They had wrought their own destruction. The entire colony had\r\nperished from starvation.\r\n\r\nThus it was, I restored the fair lands of our family to their old-time\r\nproductiveness and removed all the obstacles which stood between me and\r\nmy immediate departure from home.\r\n\r\nIn a few days all was ready.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron and the gracious baroness, my mother, parted from me\r\nwith a gentle rain of tears, and a refreshing shower of blessings.\r\nAccompanied by my dumb brother—the ever faithful Bulger—and one trusty\r\nservant, I set out by extra post for Vienna.\r\n\r\nThence at break-neck speed, I journeyed to Buda-Pesth and reached the\r\nBlack Sea via Bucharest.\r\n\r\nTraversing that body of water in a swift vessel, commanded by an old\r\nsailing-master of mine, I skirted the foot hills of the Caucasus\r\nMountains, and made my way to Teheran.\r\n\r\nHere I tarried several days, long enough to purchase a few camels and\r\nhorses and join a caravan, soon to leave that city on a trading\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the trading company renewed his welcome in heartier\r\nterms when he was informed that I had brought a goodly collection of\r\nEuropean trinkets with me.\r\n\r\nTo clinch his good will—so to speak—I gave him a pair of fine German\r\npistols.\r\n\r\nWe were now sworn friends.\r\n\r\nI remained with the expedition until it reached Cabul. The proprietor\r\nwas astounded to learn that I did not contemplate returning westward\r\nwith him. After a whole day spent in eloquent pleadings, he gave in,\r\nfell upon my neck, wept, and wished me good speed.\r\n\r\nI was glad to be rid of him, for I was in no humor to form friendships\r\nwith men whose souls never rose above a sharp bargain. Attended only by\r\nmy faithful Bulger and a single guide, I set out from Cabul; crossed\r\nnorthern Hindoostan, and entered Thibet to the north of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nThis was the land of which I had long dreamed—a land absolutely unknown\r\nto the outside world.\r\n\r\nI never had any inclination to pass over beaten tracks. By nature and\r\neducation, a lover of the strange and marvellous, my soul expanded\r\nbeneath the skies of this far-away and curious land, like a flower\r\nbeneath the sunlight of a warm May morning.\r\n\r\nScarcely had I penetrated more than a dozen leagues into this wild\r\nuntrodden territory than I made the astonishing discovery that the sun’s\r\nlight was obscured the entire day; while the sky, by night, was flooded\r\nwith a soft, mysterious light, quite bright enough to enable me to read\r\nthe finest print with perfect ease. In other words, the natural order of\r\nthings was exactly reversed. So, I—always quick to accommodate myself to\r\nexisting circumstances—made use of the dark days for rest and sleep, and\r\npursued my journey by night.\r\n\r\nOne morning, however, the mystery was explained. The impenetrable\r\nclouds, which had been veiling the heavens like a pall, suddenly sank\r\nearthward; and, to my almost unspeakable astonishment, I discovered that\r\nthis blanket of inky blackness was made up of living creatures—gigantic\r\nfire-flies, quite as large as our ordinary bat, and far blacker in both\r\nbody and wing.\r\n\r\nWhen night came, this living tissue was changed into a robe of\r\nsparkling, shimmering glow, mantling the heavens like a garment of\r\nburnished gold spangles, upon which a burst of soft light, as if from\r\nten times ten thousand waxen tapers, fell in dazzling effulgence. It was\r\nsomething to see and die for. Bulger’s poor startled mind made him look\r\nup, half in dread, half in wonder at this mysterious fire, which\r\nenveloped everything in its flame, and yet consumed nothing. I had but\r\none thought. It was to capture several of these huge fire-flies. Night\r\nafter night I watched patiently for an opportunity.\r\n\r\nIt came at last.\r\n\r\nI was preparing some coffee, and my back was turned. Suddenly, I was\r\nstartled by a piteous outburst, half whine, half bark, from poor Bulger.\r\nA cluster of these living stars had fallen at his very feet. Quicker\r\nthan thought, I sprang forward and threw my blanket over them. Then,\r\nwith the greatest care, I transferred them to one of my wicker hampers.\r\n\r\nBulger, upon seeing this basket on fire and yet feeling no heat, was\r\nmost painfully nonplused. He walked round and round the improvised cage,\r\nkeeping at a safe distance, however, now sniffing the air, now looking\r\nup to me with a most imploring glance—as if to say:\r\n\r\n“Dear little master, do explain this thing to me! Why doesn’t it burn\r\nup?”\r\n\r\nTo my great disappointment, the three captives died after a few days’\r\nimprisonment, not, however, until they had laid a number of eggs—about\r\nthe size of robins’ eggs—which I packed away most carefully in my boxes\r\nof specimens.\r\n\r\nI may say, right here, that, upon my return home, I subjected these eggs\r\nto a gentle warmth and was charmed to see emerge from each one of them a\r\nlarva about the size of a pipe-stem; but, to my delight—and to Bulger’s\r\nabsolute terror—this pipe-stem affair had, inside twenty-four hours,\r\nbecome as large round as a Frankfort sausage.\r\n\r\nIn due time, they passed into the chrysalis state. But this apparent\r\ndeath seemed to become a real one.\r\n\r\nWeeks went by and there were no signs of a metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nI was cruelly disappointed.\r\n\r\nMore important matters, however, arose to occupy my thoughts. The\r\nsleeping fire-flies of the Orient were quite forgotten, when, one\r\nevening, the women servants of the manor house, with blanched faces and\r\npiercing shrieks came literally tumbling headlong down the main\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\nFortunately I was sitting on the first terrace of the park. With a bound\r\nI gained the hall-way, and snatching down a brace of fire-arms from the\r\nwall, throw myself in front of the wildly shrieking troop of women,\r\ncalling out in stentorian tones, for silence.\r\n\r\n“Has murder been committed?” I cried, “Is there revolt among the\r\ntenantry? Has blood been shed?”\r\n\r\n“No! no! little baron!” they exclaimed, with wild eyes and clasped\r\nhands, “but the castle is on fire! Your rooms are in flames! Your\r\ntreasures will be consumed! Quick! little baron; save them! save us!\r\nsave the gracious lady and venerable master!”\r\n\r\nQuicker than it takes to tell it, I laid hold of the rope of the alarm\r\nbell and set it pealing.\r\n\r\nThe retainers answered with a will. A score of them burst into the\r\nhall-way ready for the word of command.\r\n\r\n“Seize the fire-buckets, my lads!” I called out calmly, but in a tone of\r\nsufficient dignity to inspire perfect confidence.\r\n\r\n“Man ladders to the windows of my apartments.”\r\n\r\nBy this time another gang of the tenantry came rushing in upon the\r\nscene. I met them with an order to unhang the portraits in the baronial\r\ndining-hall, and store them in a place of safety. Then, having spoken a\r\nfew words of comfort to the gracious baroness, my mother, I seized a\r\nfire-bucket and led the line up the stairway. Laying my shoulder against\r\nthe door of my apartments, I burst it open; and, with head lowered\r\nbefore the blaze of light dashed in, followed by the bucket-bearers.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” I cried.\r\n\r\nIt was too late! some of my finest hangings and rugs were spoiled by\r\nhalf a dozen buckets of water emptied upon them.\r\n\r\nThe mystery was solved! The blaze of light that fairly flooded my\r\napartments proceeded from the huge fire-flies which had hatched out\r\nwithout being noticed by me. But I didn’t begrudge my ruined hangings.\r\n\r\nThere was my recompense clinging to the walls.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say, that the giant fire-flies were the wonder of their\r\nday, and brief as it was it sufficed to cover my name with a glory as\r\nresplendent, as their mysterious fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE BARON READING BY THE LIGHT OF THE GIGANTIC\r\nFIRE-FLIES.]\r\n\r\nI caused a huge lamp of exquisite oriental pattern to be constructed,\r\nand having placed the light-bearers beneath its dome of polished glass,\r\npassed several nights in the most perfect happiness, seated in its soft,\r\nwhite light, poring over musty volumes of travel, written in tongues\r\nlong-forgotten, save by a few of the most learned scholars. But, my\r\ndelight was short-lived. The gigantic fire-flies absolutely refused to\r\neat anything, although I tempted them with a hundred different kinds of\r\nfood. Little by little, their mysterious flame lost its bright\r\neffulgence—burning lower and lower until it went out in death.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo resume the thread of my story:\r\n\r\nI was growing impatient to reach the table-lands of the Himalayas, and\r\ntaxed the powers of endurance of my guide to their uttermost.\r\n\r\nIn our bivouacs at times he would encircle my slender ankle-joints with\r\nhis thumb and index finger and exclaim: “All the gods helped make thee,\r\nlittle baron!” meaning that there dwelt great will-power and strength in\r\nmy small body.\r\n\r\nThe skies now cleared up. The living pall rolled backward, toward the\r\nhorizon, and naught remained to tell of the mighty flood of light which\r\nso lately overran the heavens save a faint shimmering streak of fire in\r\nfar distant Western sky.\r\n\r\nSoon it went out altogether. Thus far, our journey had been through an\r\nopen country, with here and there a clump of forest trees which, at last\r\ngrew so frequent that I felt sure we must be approaching the confines of\r\nsome extensive piece of woodland.\r\n\r\nIn this I was not mistaken.\r\n\r\nAs we reached the summit of a range of hills, I could see in the\r\ndistance a long, dark line of forests. My guide, who had pushed on\r\nahead, in search of water, came galloping wildly back.\r\n\r\nI paid no particular attention to him, until I noticed that he had\r\ndismounted in great haste and was running towards me.\r\n\r\n“Turn back! turn back! little master!” he exclaimed, throwing himself at\r\nmy feet, and clasping my legs with his arms!\r\n\r\n“Enter not in the Palin-mâ-Talin! (Home of Darkness.) A hundred pilgrims\r\nhave laid their bones in the moss-grown depths of the Great Gloomy\r\nForest! It is as pathless as the ocean! It is as silent as death. It is\r\nas limitless as the heavens! Nor man nor beast can breathe its cool,\r\nmoist air, and live! Turn back! I beseech thee, little baron; tempt not\r\nthe Palin-mâ-Talin!”\r\n\r\n“Palin-mâ-Talin! Palin-mâ-Talin!” I repeated, as if awakening from a\r\ndream, “why, it must be—ay, there can be no doubt of it—the Great Aryan\r\nForest, in which, countless centuries ago, the human race having\r\nabandoned their holes in the clay banks, first learned to hunt the wild\r\nbeast, feed on his flesh and clothe themselves in his skins.”\r\n\r\nIn my joy at this discovery I threw a handful of gold pieces into the\r\nlap of my astonished guide.\r\n\r\nBulger, always ready to share my happiness, came bounding to my side,\r\nbarking loud and shrill. To my infinite surprise, the answering bark of\r\na dog came floating on the morning breeze.\r\n\r\n“Hark!” I exclaimed, in a whisper. This time it was unmistakable.\r\n\r\n“’Tis one of Benè-agâ’s dogs!” was my guide’s reply. “Come, little\r\nmaster, let me lead thee to his cave. It is beneath the very shadow of\r\nthe Great Gloomy Forest. He can tell thee of its dangers, for he hath\r\ncrossed it!”\r\n\r\n“And come safely back?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“While life lasts he will sit in the gloom of Palin-mâ-Talin!” murmured\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\n“What meanest thou?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“I mean, that the noonday sun cannot chase the shadows from his eyes.”\r\n\r\n“He is blind?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, little master, blind!” was the guide’s reply, “and yet save this\r\nblind hermit, there lives no human creature who can lead thee safely\r\nthrough the Great Gloomy Forest!”\r\n\r\n“Have done with thy jesting!” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Nay, little master!” was the man’s answer. “I speak in all truth and\r\nreverence, for Benè-agâ is a holy man, and in him dwells such a radiant\r\nspirit, that his path is illumined and his footsteps are sure when other\r\nmen would walk to their destruction!”\r\n\r\n“O, lead me to him!” I exclaimed with ill-concealed joy. “A thousand\r\npieces of gold are thine, if the blind hermit consents to be my guide.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand pieces of gold!” repeated the guide with a gleam in his dark\r\neyes. “Ah, little baron, no one can earn that princely reward, excepting\r\nthee thyself! Who am I, poor, miserable, ignorant slave that I am, that\r\nI should attempt to move this saintly and learned man in thy behalf? He\r\nwould heed the cry of one of his dogs far more quickly than he would my\r\nchatter!”\r\n\r\n“Is he so unlike his kind,” I asked, as we rode slowly along, “as not to\r\nlove gold?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, little baron! if every dried leaf in his forest path were a coin of\r\nburnished gold, he would not stoop to pick one up!”\r\n\r\n“Are his ears closed to flattery?”\r\n\r\n“As closed as his eyes are to the sun’s rays.”\r\n\r\n“Loves he not some savory dish?”\r\n\r\n“Fruits and berries content him!”\r\n\r\n“Surely a draught of rare old wine, mellow with age, fragrant as crushed\r\nroses, purple within the beaker, would warm his heart to quicker\r\nbeating, and incline him to serve me!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay, little baron! a gourd full of water from the sparkling rill\r\nnear his home in the rocks, is sweeter to him than any nectar ever\r\ndistilled by the hands of man!”\r\n\r\n“They say he is learned! Then shall my gift be a score of rare old\r\nbooks, priceless parchments filled with thoughts so noble, so deep, so\r\nsubtle, that, to read therein, means to live a thousand years in one!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, little master,” replied my guide, with a mournful smile, “thou art\r\nstill astray. This dweller ’mid the rocks, this lover of solitude, the\r\nmeasure of whose life, they say, is full three hundred years, knows no\r\nother books than the pages of his own soul! On these he has turned his\r\nthoughts so long and so diligently, that the foolish outpourings of\r\nso-called authors seem like the merest prattle of childhood.”\r\n\r\n“But look, little master, we are drawing near the home of the blind\r\nhermit.”\r\n\r\nI turned my eyes in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\nA rocky ledge, wild, craggy, broken, seamed and twisted, crowned with a\r\ngrowth of pine trees having knotted, gnarled and fantastically-shaped\r\ntrunks and boughs, shut in our view. As we drew near the entrance to\r\nBenè-agâ’s cave, a troop of dogs, of various ages and species, came\r\nbounding forward with loud barkings.\r\n\r\nBulger advanced to meet them boldly, after first glancing at my face to\r\nsee whether I objected or not.\r\n\r\nIt was a long while since he had met any of the members of his race, and\r\nthen again, he doubtless wished to get a good look at these residents of\r\nsuch a distant land.\r\n\r\nThe feeling seemed to be mutual, for in an instant the barking ceased,\r\nand the hermit’s dogs gathered about Bulger in silent wonderment.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of salutations, which plainly ended in the best of\r\nfellowships, the hermit’s dogs endeavored to lure Bulger away for a run\r\nin the forest and fields, but in this they were, I need scarcely say,\r\nentirely unsuccessful. Bulger gave them to understand in very decided\r\nterms that he would talk with them, and even romp with them, but that it\r\nmust all be done under the eyes of his master.\r\n\r\nWe now halted and dismounted.\r\n\r\n“This is the place,” said my guide in a low tone. “Through that deep\r\nfissure in the rocks thou wilt find a path that leads to Benè-agâ’s\r\ncave. Enter it boldly, little master. At the entrance to the cave thou\r\nwilt find a dried gourd hanging on the rocky wall. Seize it! When\r\nshaken, its seeds will give forth a loud, rattling sound. This done,\r\nmove not, though the shadows of evening find thee still standing at the\r\ndoor of Benè-agâ’s cave. Farewell, little master; Heaven make good to\r\nthee tenfold thy kindness to me! I will await thee three days. If by\r\nthat time I do not hear thy voice calling me to serve thee again, I\r\nshall return to my kindred!”\r\n\r\nAdvancing to the cleft in the rocky wall, I found the gourd hanging by a\r\nleathern thong.\r\n\r\nThe loud rattling of the seeds, as it broke the deep silence of this\r\nwild and lonely place—fit vestibule to a temple devoted to silence,\r\nsolitude and meditation—startled me painfully.\r\n\r\nRestoring the gourd to its place, I leaned forward to catch the faintest\r\nsound of the hermit’s voice which might reach my ear.\r\n\r\nIt came not.\r\n\r\nThe silence grew more oppressive than before.\r\n\r\nThe broken, twisted rocks, overhanging and surrounding me, took on\r\nfantastic forms.\r\n\r\nIn every dark cavity I saw some misshapen creature stirring about.\r\n\r\nA dreadful feeling of loneliness crept over me.\r\n\r\nNo sound came, save the loud throbbing of my own heart.\r\n\r\nA half hour went by!\r\n\r\nBenè-agâ spake not a word.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he sleeps!” I whispered to myself.\r\n\r\nMy words awakened the echoes of the rocky recesses, and the word\r\n“sleeps” came back to my ears in a hundred different tones, now loud and\r\nhissing, now soft and sibilant.\r\n\r\nAt last a full hour had now gone by since I had rattled the seeds of the\r\ndried gourd, and yet the blind hermit spake no word.\r\n\r\nAgain the death-like stillness sank upon the place, and the gathering\r\nshadows grew deeper and deeper.\r\n\r\nCould the guide have played me false? I asked myself.\r\n\r\nNay, that cannot be!\r\n\r\nAnd yet why comes there no sound from Benè-agâ’s cave?\r\n\r\nShall I summon him once more? May he not have gone forth to gather food?\r\n\r\nAm I doomed to be turned back when I have reached the very threshold of\r\nmy long-wished-for desire?\r\n\r\nThese and a hundred other questions flitted through my mind as I stood\r\nin the dark and gloomy corridor that led to Benè-agâ’s cave.\r\n\r\nBy the shadows on the rocky wall I could see that I had now been\r\nstanding at least two hours awaiting summons to draw nearer.\r\n\r\nBut hush!\r\n\r\nHe speaks at last!\r\n\r\nMy heart bounded joyfully, and yet as if with a leaden weight upon it.\r\n\r\n“Who is it that disturbs my meditation?” were the hermit’s words.\r\n\r\n“A stranger! A brother! One who needs thy guidance!” I replied in a\r\nfirm, yet humble tone.\r\n\r\n“No human creature is stranger to me! Thou art too young to be my\r\nbrother! The light that is left me shines only for my own feet!” came\r\nslowly from the hermit’s cave in a full, deep, rich voice.\r\n\r\n“True, great master,” I replied, “but then, may I not be thy son, and\r\nfollow thy footsteps?”\r\n\r\n“Thou art very wise for thy years,” spake Benè-agâ.\r\n\r\n“Not so wise, great master,” was my reply, “as I shall be when I have\r\nsat at thy feet.”\r\n\r\n“Come somewhat closer; thy child-voice sounds like an echo,” continued\r\nthe blind hermit. “And yet thou art not a child! Some great spirit plays\r\nin sportive mood behind thy face! I see that thou art blue-eyed and\r\nflaxen-haired. Thine eyes are set wide asunder, and above them towers a\r\ndome of thought. Thy home is in the land of the Norseman. At least thy\r\nfathers dwelt there. On thy cheek glows the crimson which, in the peach\r\nand apple-land, stains the autumn foliage!”\r\n\r\nAs I had not yet even stepped within Benè-agâ’s cave, these words of the\r\nblind hermit caused a strange feeling, half of fear, half of dread\r\nfascination, to creep over me.\r\n\r\nMy heart throbbed violently.\r\n\r\nHis ear, far keener than birds’ or beasts’, caught the sound.\r\n\r\n“Fear not, little one!” said he, in deep, rich tones, full and swelling\r\nlike the voice of organ pipes, “if thou canst content thyself with a\r\nhandful of berries when thou art hungry, with a draught from the\r\nneighboring rill when thou art thirsty; if thy young limbs are sturdy\r\nenough to wrest repose from a rocky couch, then art thou welcome! If\r\nnot, go thy way! For twenty years I’ve been busy with a certain problem,\r\nand have no time to stop and spread a more bountiful repast!”\r\n\r\n“But season thy frugal fare with thy wisdom, great master,” I returned,\r\n“and it will be sweeter to my palate than stall-fed ox and mellow wine.”\r\n\r\n“Come somewhat nearer, little traveler, so that I may see thee better!”\r\nspake the blind hermit, kindly and gently.\r\n\r\nI did not wait for further summons, but stepped boldly into Benè-agâ’s\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nIt was, in truth, little more than a lofty cleft in the rocks, with\r\nseveral deeper recesses, in which the shadows lay undisturbed. Its roof\r\nof jagged, broken and blackened masses of stone, was arched and lofty.\r\nIn and about it, flocks of small swallow-like birds nested, and at times\r\nbroke out in musical twitterings. Barren, gloomy and utterly forlorn as\r\nthe place was, without chair, mat, bed or blanket, every thought of its\r\nawful loneliness and abject surroundings vanished from my mind, as I\r\nfixed my eyes upon its occupant.\r\n\r\nAs I had stepped within the limit of Benè-agâ’s cave, he had slowly\r\nrisen from his bench of stone, and now stood erect before me. Of\r\npowerful build, tall and majestic, with long snow-white hair and snowy\r\nbeard, he towered like a statue of Parian marble in the dim twilight, to\r\nwhich now, however, my eyes had become accustomed.\r\n\r\nI gazed upon him, half in fear, half in delight.\r\n\r\nI could feel my breath coming fast and faster, as I riveted my gaze upon\r\nhis wonderful face, so full of love, patience, courage and contentment.\r\n\r\nHad he bent his eyes upon me, I would never have believed him blind, for\r\nthey were unclouded, full and lustrous. And yet, on second look, I saw\r\nthat their gleam was like the brightness of the polished gem, that lacks\r\nthe softness of living, sensitive orbs.\r\n\r\nBenè-agâ was clad in a rude garb of dried skins, from which the hair had\r\nbeen skilfully scraped. Tossed back from his broad and massive brow, his\r\nwhite locks hung in heavy ringlets on his broad shoulders, while his\r\nwonderful beard, as white and glistening as spun glass—around his body\r\ntwice entwined—clung like a snow-wreath twisted about a sturdy oak by\r\nthe circling gale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENÈ-AGÂ, THE BLIND GUIDE.]\r\n\r\nSo, like a mighty son of earth he towered, rude, yet noble; untaught yet\r\nlearned, human yet godlike that I stood transfixed. My tongue forgot its\r\ntricks of speech. I felt that I should turn to stone, if he did not\r\nspeak to me.\r\n\r\nWhile standing thus speechless, robbed of power to move a limb, Bulger\r\nbroke the spell!\r\n\r\nAt Benè-agâ’s feet lay a sick dog, infirm thro’ age and not ailment;\r\nblind like his master, his head pillowed on some soft dry leaves—the\r\nonly semblance of bed within the hermit’s cave.\r\n\r\nBulger’s gaze fell upon this pitiful spectacle. With cautious step,\r\noutstretched neck, and wide-opened eyes, he approached his sick brother,\r\nsniffed him over, licked his face and ears, whined piteously and then\r\nfixed a pleading look upon me as if to ask: “Dear little master, canst\r\nthou do nothing to help my poor, sick brother? Canst thou not make him\r\nwell again, so that I may coax him out into the warm sunshine to play\r\nwith him?”\r\n\r\nBenè-agâ spake: “I see that thou art not alone, little wanderer, thou\r\nbringest a companion with thee. He is welcome. His tenderness and\r\nsympathy will carry joy and gladness to the heart of my suffering\r\nfriend, whose head I’ve pillowed upon some soft grass! I, too, love\r\ndogs! Thou seest they are my sole companions. Their love is less\r\nexacting than human love. They require no pledge or promise. They\r\nunderstand my silence, read my thoughts and are content!”\r\n\r\n“But, come! little traveler, time presses. Speak! What brings thee to\r\nBenè-agâ’s cave? If it be idle curiosity, depart! But, if thou seekest\r\ncounsel; if thou comest with honest intent to ask my advice in some\r\narduous matter, I am ready to serve thee!”\r\n\r\n“I thank thee, great master!” I replied, humbly. “Know then that I would\r\ntraverse the Great Gloomy Forest and that report hath reached mine ear\r\nthat thou alone, of all human beings, canst guide me through its\r\nnever-lifting shadows, shield me from its poisonous vapors and let me\r\nnot follow my own foot-prints in ever-widening circles, until reason\r\nitself feels the dreaded spell of that vast, trackless, pathless\r\nwilderness!”\r\n\r\n“’Tis true!” gave answer Benè-agâ in deep, sad tones. “I can perform the\r\nservice thou askest! But, O, my son! thou must know that a most sacred\r\nvow holds me in its mysterious power, securely locked, that I should\r\nlead no fellow-creature through that pathless wood, save on certain\r\nconditions!”\r\n\r\n“Name them, great master!” I cried.\r\n\r\n“That he who asks this service,” continued Benè-agâ, “shall tarry thirty\r\ndays and nights with me in my rocky home, to inure him to the burden of\r\nawful gloom and silence; that he, in all that time, taste of no food\r\nsave the berries, on which I feed; slake his thirst with no draught\r\nother than that which I bring him from the neighboring rill and sleep on\r\nthe bare rock, even as I do! Reflect! the apprenticeship is severe. Deem\r\nit not dishonorable, nor weak, to shrink from so hard a task! Pause,\r\nreflect, ere thou answerest. I’ll resume my meditations for an hour and\r\nthen question thee again!”\r\n\r\n“Be it so, great master!” I made answer; and, Benè-agâ’s sightless eyes\r\nseem to turn to the shrunken form of the dying dog.\r\n\r\nSilence filled the cave, and feeble twilight struggled against the\r\ngathering gloom. My thoughts turned homewards! I could hear the gentle\r\nvoice of the baroness, my mother. The castle windows were lighted, and\r\nthe tall lindens shook a rich perfume from their blossoming boughs. All\r\nseemed so sweet and peaceful. My mother’s voice reached me—I caught its\r\nevery word: “Set forth my son’s repast!” said she in soft, mild tones.\r\n“See that his favorite dishes are kept warm. Choose none but the\r\nchoicest wine for him; and, take good care that his bed be soft and\r\neven, and his pillow’s smooth!” My breath came only with painful effort\r\nas these words rang in my ears.\r\n\r\nI started up with a bound. In spite of myself, I took a step toward the\r\nportal of Benè-agâ’s cave, where the last rays of the setting sun tipped\r\nthe angry, jagged, broken rocks with gold.\r\n\r\n“Well, my son!” spake the blind hermit. “Art thou still resolute?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, great master!” I cried, turning back and drawing near to him.\r\n\r\n“Fear naught! Though puny in body, yet was I born with the strength of\r\nsteel in my limbs, and the will power of a score of common men.”\r\n\r\n“Lead thou on! I will follow thee.”\r\n\r\nA faint smile spread over the noble countenance of the blind hermit, as\r\nhe replied:\r\n\r\n“I have not told thee all, my son! Till we pass from these walls of\r\nstone, and stand in the open air, thou must not speak a word aloud. Nay,\r\nnor in a whisper, either. I will set thy food and drink before thee, and\r\nthat,” he continued, pointing to a projecting shelf of rock, “shall be\r\nthy bed! On its bare surface, rest thy limbs when nature bids thee\r\nsleep. Art thou still resolute?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, great master!” I replied with loud and buoyant voice, “I will do\r\nthy bidding!”\r\n\r\n“’Tis well!” said Benè-agâ. “I like thy brave and steadfast soul! But\r\nhold me not hard of heart in condemning thee to this gloom and silence!\r\nTemper the bitterness of thy fate by giving thyself over to deep and\r\nearnest meditation, during the few brief hours that it shall last.\r\nForget the so-called world—a bubble that bursts when thou thinkest to\r\ngrasp it; a shadow, which thou pursuest with eager pace, and yet canst\r\nnever overtake; a mirage, rising before the weary traveler’s gaze, with\r\nvisions of delicious gardens, watered by limpid rills and cooled by\r\nsparkling fountains, only to melt away and leave him more weak and\r\nfainting than before. Look within thyself! Thou art the temple of an\r\nimmortal soul! Enter its portals! Fix thine eyes on the mysterious\r\nwritings there unrolled! Grow not weary and discouraged if thou canst\r\nnot decipher their meaning as easily as thou wouldst the books of man!\r\nAnd O, my son, should the gloom and silence of Benè-agâ’s cave weigh too\r\nheavily on thy young soul, raise thine eyes to some one of the many\r\nlines which I have carved upon these rocky walls, in my hours of\r\nrecreation. They will guide thee back to sweet contentment; give thee\r\nstrength to persevere unto the end! And now, my son, farewell! Though\r\nwith thee, near thee, even by thy side, yet remember, I am far from\r\nthee. Ay, farther than earthly staff can measure! Be hopeful, be strong,\r\nand thou wilt conquer! Again, farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Farewell, great master, farewell!” I exclaimed; and, as my words echoed\r\nthrough the vast, rocky chamber, the last ray of light fled before the\r\nthickening gloom, and all was inky blackness.\r\n\r\nI had noticed, ere the darkness came, that I was standing near the\r\nprojecting shelf of rock which was to serve me as a bed, when nature\r\ncalled me to rest.\r\n\r\nTurning now softly, I groped my way toward it and stretched myself at\r\nfull length on its bare surface. For a few moments all went well. Such a\r\nconflict of thought was raging in the chambers of my mind, that I took\r\nno note of the chill which this couch of stone sent creeping through my\r\nlimbs. I closed my eyes, thinking to coax sleep to them, and thus forget\r\nthe ever-increasing pang!\r\n\r\nIn vain! It seemed as if death itself had seized my feet between his icy\r\npalms!\r\n\r\nSharp pains leapt from one joint to another, and wherever my body came\r\ninto contact with that couch of stone, it seemed as if a thousand\r\nneedles pricked my flesh. Half-crazed by the ever-increasing agony, I\r\ntossed from side to side, like one in delirium. At times I sat up to\r\nescape from stupefying dizziness which caught me in its swift,\r\nencircling whirl! My heated pulse beat at the thin walls of my temple,\r\nuntil it seemed as if I should go mad! A rushing, soughing, gurgling\r\nsound of many waters roared in my ears, while strange, fantastic forms,\r\nin lines of fire on inky background, flitted to and fro before my eyes,\r\nuntil I began to fear I should soon be doomed to sit in eternal gloom\r\nlike Benè-agâ himself.\r\n\r\nAnd now heat and cold held alternate sway within my tired and broken\r\nframe. Vainly I strove to wet my parched lips with my tongue! The fever\r\nhad dried it to a chip. For a few brief moments the torture ceased!\r\n\r\nI breathed more freely!\r\n\r\nMy limbs, thought I, are getting used to their couch of stone! I shall\r\nfull asleep and forget my sufferings!\r\n\r\nBut no! With redoubled fury they came back to their work.\r\n\r\nI dared not cry out so soon to Benè-agâ, for mercy, for release from the\r\ncruel conditions he had imposed upon me! Rather death than yield so\r\nquickly; shrink so like a coward who stands motionless and trembling on\r\nthe battle field, as a spent ball strikes his breast.\r\n\r\nI slept at last!\r\n\r\nBut O, what a broken, fevered sleep it was! A sleep with unclosed eyes,\r\nfull of dark and dismal sights. I could stand no more. I yielded and\r\nlonged for death. In thought, I kissed my parents’ hands and felt their\r\nsoft caresses on my brow and face. And then, it seemed the gracious\r\nbaroness, my mother, caught my hand in hers and pressed it fervently on\r\nher lips. The kiss was so warm, so tender, so life-like, that I started\r\nup like one awakening from a long delirium. It cannot be a dream, I\r\nmurmured, I am awake!\r\n\r\nTossing my racked form over on its side, so that I could touch my right\r\nhand—the one on which I had felt the kiss, with my left the mystery was\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n’T was Bulger!\r\n\r\nHe was beside my couch of stone. It was he who had licked my cold, numb\r\nhand and turned my thoughts homeward. I caressed his head and ears and\r\nsought to make him lie down lest the rustle might disturb the blind\r\nhermit. He refused to obey, altho’ I thrice let him know my wishes. It\r\nwas his first act of disobedience and for an instant drove all thoughts\r\nof pain from my mind. To all my suffering now came this new grief.\r\n\r\nAroused from my stupor at last, by his persistent refusal to obey I\r\ncollected my thoughts sufficiently to realize that he was bent upon\r\nleaping on my couch. His forefeet were already resting upon its edge. I\r\ndared not resist lest he should break the solemn stillness of Benè-agâ’s\r\ncave by giving vent to some sound of entreaty. No sooner had he sprung\r\nupon the rocky shelf than I felt him crouching on its edge, and reaching\r\ndown as if in the act of seizing something in his teeth, something so\r\nheavy, too, that it called for violent exertion. Whatever it was, I was\r\nnot slow in discovering that he was endeavoring to drag it upon my rocky\r\ncouch. Half rising, I stretched out my hand to solve the mystery.\r\n\r\nO beloved Bulger!\r\n\r\nIn an outburst of affection I pressed my lips repeatedly upon his body.\r\nHe took no note of my caresses, but only tugged the harder at the thing\r\nhe held within his teeth. It was my blanket!\r\n\r\nTaught in his early years to fetch my slippers, my gloves, my cap to me,\r\nwhen he found them lying here or there, he had never forgotten to render\r\nme these petty services. And thus, noticing that my blanket had,\r\napparently, been forgotten, he seized it, heavy as it was and dragged it\r\nto his little master’s bed.\r\n\r\nRegardless of Benè-agâ’s ire; unmindful of the fact that to accept\r\nBulger’s gift was plainly an open breach of the compact between the\r\nblind hermit and me, I wrapped my bruised and aching body in the thick,\r\nwarm covering and fell into a long refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nSuch was my first night in Benè-agâ’s cave. The next day was bright and\r\nclear and the rocky chamber seemed less dismal to me. My eyes were\r\nbecoming accustomed to the gloom.\r\n\r\nFrom morn till night, I shunned that bed of torture, passing my time\r\nstudying out the hidden meaning of the words which Benè-agâ has carved\r\non the rocky walls; watching the birds as they flitted in with food for\r\ntheir nestlings or standing near the blind hermit with my gaze riveted\r\nupon his noble features, thick, clustering hair and far-flowing beard!\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth all went well. I soon forgot the long hours of that\r\nterrible night of silence and despair. Indeed, I was astounded to find\r\nhow swiftly the time sped along when one gives himself up to deep and\r\nall-absorbing meditation.\r\n\r\nDays and nights flitted by like alternate hours of light and darkness.\r\n\r\nI was startled from a deep sleep by hearing the full round voice of\r\nBenè-agâ saying: “Up! up! little traveler, up! my son, the morn is\r\nbreaking. The appointed hour has come! To-day we must enter\r\nPalin-mâ-Talin or all thy apprenticeship shall have been in vain!”\r\n\r\nI sprang up; and, approaching Benè-agâ, related in tones of unfeigned\r\ngrief, how I had disregarded the sacred compact between us; and, that,\r\naltho’ it cut me to the heart, to be obliged to turn back, when I stood\r\nupon the very confines of the Great Gloomy Forest, yet I was not worthy\r\nto follow him, and was firmly resolved not to plead for mercy!\r\n\r\nAll! I told him all! how my frame had been so racked by pain that I was\r\nupon the very point of crying out for release from the terrible compact,\r\nwhen my beloved Bulger came to my relief, and saved me from that\r\ndegradation. He heard me in silence, his noble countenance giving no\r\nsign or hint of what was going on within that lofty soul.\r\n\r\nAt last, a sad and almost imperceptible smile spread over his face and\r\nhe spake as follows: “Take heart, my son. All is forgiven. Thou art but\r\na child and I should have lightened the burden of this apprenticeship.\r\nNor can I hold thee worthy of blame for yielding to such a touching\r\nproof of thy dog’s love for thee! Hadst thou repulsed him he would have\r\nlain in wakeful sorrow by thy bedside all that night—dear, faithful\r\nsoul! Would he belonged to me!”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Benè-agâ bent his towering form and caressed Bulger’s head\r\nand ears.\r\n\r\nNor was Bulger slow in returning the hermit’s caresses. They had become\r\nthe best of friends. Bulger felt the fascination of Benè-agâ’s\r\nmysterious power from the very first.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour arrived for us to leave the rocky chamber of gloom and\r\nsilence, and step out into the sunlight once more, my heart broke out\r\ninto its old-time beat. Had I not been in the presence of the venerable\r\nBenè-agâ, I should have leapt and danced for joy, as we emerged from\r\nthat dreary abode, and I felt the warm air fan my cheek once more. But,\r\none thing struck me now most forcibly. It was the wonderful change which\r\nI noted in the blind hermit himself, when he stood in the sunlight and\r\nthe morning breezes tossed the curls of his white, silken hair, like\r\nApril winds making merry with a flock of snowflakes. First, his\r\nappearance was quite different from that to which I had become\r\naccustomed. A leathern cap crowned his massive head, and held his thick,\r\nrebellious hair somewhat in control. His wide-flowing beard had entirely\r\ndisappeared beneath his rude garb, save where it clothed his face and\r\nneck. I saw at once that he was clad for work—for toilsome progress\r\nthrough Palin-mâ-Talin’s thick growth. In his right hand he carried a\r\ncurious rod or wand, long, slender, polished and extremely flexible. I\r\nsoon learned to wonder at his extraordinary skill in using this staff to\r\nguide his steps or discover the nature of any object not within the\r\nreach of his hands. A rude pouch or leather bag was swung across his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe change in Benè-agâ’s manner was still more noticeable. To me, this\r\nchange was as pleasing as it was unexpected. In a brief half hour he\r\nbecame another man. His deep, rich voice, soft and round as the sound of\r\nan organ-pipe took on a mellower tone! A faint smile wreathed his noble\r\nfeatures, as the sunlight fell upon them. His step became quick and\r\nelastic, his movements brisk and agile. So wonderfully keen were his\r\nremaining senses that only the closest observer could have guessed that\r\nhe was blind.\r\n\r\nTurning in the direction of the spot where his dogs were at play, he\r\nstartled me by breaking out into a joyous,—\r\n\r\n“Yo ho! my children! Yo ho! my brothers! Here to me! Here to me!”\r\n\r\nHis dogs—Bulger among them—bounded forward with a loud chorus of\r\nbarking. Benè-agâ caught the stranger’s voice. “It pains me deeply,” he\r\ncried, “to rob him of his playfellows, for I see him gamboling and\r\nsporting with my children!”\r\n\r\nAs the blind hermit stooped, his dogs, with loud cries of sorrow at\r\nparting, sprang up to lick his face and hands.\r\n\r\n“Go, my children! Go, my brothers!” said Benè-agâ. “Content yourselves.\r\nI’ll come again soon, very soon, with love warmed by absence!”\r\n\r\nAll was now ready for the start. Beneath the rising sun I could see a\r\nlong, dark line, far away, where earth and sky came together. It was\r\nPalin-mâ-Talin. Home of Darkness! The Great Gloomy Forest!\r\n\r\nThither Benè-agâ now directed his footsteps with astonishing rapidity of\r\ngait, tapping the ground with his long, polished wand as he hurried\r\nalong!\r\n\r\nAwe-struck, I followed my blind guide!\r\n\r\nIn comparison with such miraculous powers of hearing, smelling and\r\nfeeling, my eyes were worthless. Ever and anon he called out to me:\r\n\r\n“Guard thee well, my son, a viper stirred in the grass to thy left!\r\nGuard thee well, my son, to touch the leaves of the flowering shrub\r\nthrough which we are passing now—they are poisonous.”\r\n\r\n“Guard thee well, my son, to taste the waters of the rivulet to which we\r\nare coming, until I have made trial of its purity.”\r\n\r\n“Guard thee well, my son, to pluck one of the flowers which now delight\r\nthy eye, and charm thee with their odor. ’Tis next to death to breath\r\ntheir perfume close to thy nostrils.”\r\n\r\n“Guard thee well, my son, to crush upon thy skin one of the little\r\ninsects which now fill the air, lest thou spread a subtle poison o’er\r\nthy flesh!”\r\n\r\nAs we drew near to the outer edge of the Great Gloomy Forest, a strange\r\njoy lit up Benè-agâ’s face. He beat the air with his polished wand in\r\ngraceful curves and circles, as he poured forth, half singing, half\r\nreciting, a sort of chant, invocation, or mysterious greeting to\r\nPalin-mâ-Talin, Home of Darkness!\r\n\r\nAs if charmed by the rich music of his own voice, his spirits ran higher\r\nand higher. At times he halted to catch the soft echoes as they came\r\nfloating back on the wings of the morning air.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as I can remember Benè-agâ’s chant was something like this:\r\n\r\n“O, la, la, la, la, l-a-a-a-a! Hail to thee, Palin-mâ-Talin. Shadowy\r\nLand! La, la! Lu, la, lo, li! Lu, la, lo, li! We are coming to thee,\r\nbeloved Temple of Silence and Gloom! Let us into thy dark corridors,\r\nPalin-mâ-Talin Lo-il-la! Lo-il-la! Thou art victor! Palin-mâ-Talin, my\r\nbeautiful! From thy buckler of darkness fall the Sun’s arrows,\r\nsplintered and broken! O, la, la, la, la, la, l-a-a-aa-a-a! We are\r\ncoming King of Gloom and Stillness! Palin-mâ-Talin. O silent domain! Let\r\nus in from the roar and the glare! Let us in from the roofless world. We\r\nare near at hand, Palin-mâ-Talin! Swing open thy black portals! Lift thy\r\nveil of Gloom! Admit thy children into thy silent chambers. O,\r\nPalin-mâ-Talin, Lo-il-lo! Lo-il-lo! Lo-il-lo! Lo-il-l-a-a-a-a-a-a!”\r\n\r\nAt last we stood by the very edge of Palin-mâ-Talin.\r\n\r\nBenè-agâ swept his polished wand against the foliage of one of the\r\nlow-hanging, far-reaching branches; then, sprang forward and seizing a\r\nhandful of the leaves, crushed them in his grasp and raised them to his\r\nnostrils. “This is not the gateway, my son” he cried, “we must turn\r\nfarther northward!”\r\n\r\nAfter about half an hour, he again halted and reaching out for a handful\r\nof the leaves inhaled their odor.\r\n\r\n“Not yet! not yet!” he murmured. “Somewhat northward still! Be not\r\ntroubled, my son. Thou see’st Palin-mâ-Talin with thine outward eye! Not\r\nso Benè-agâ! He must lay his hand upon the very walls of this Temple of\r\nSilence and Gloom ere he can see it!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the blind hermit paused. His thin nostrils quivered, his\r\nmassive breast heaved convulsively. “We are almost there!” he spoke in\r\nmeasured tones. “I catch the perfume of the foliage which clothes the\r\ntwo ebon columns of the gateway.” I looked and saw before me two\r\ntowering trees, whose wide-reaching branches swept the very ground. Side\r\nby side they stood, alike in size and grandeur. Benè-agâ passed his hand\r\ncaressingly over the first branch which brushed his cheek and pressed\r\nits leaves to his lips; then, broke out into his wild chant once more.\r\n\r\nI stood looking at the blind hermit and listening to his song of\r\ngreeting, hardly knowing what to expect next when, suddenly, he threw\r\nhimself upon his knees and crept under the far-reaching branches of one\r\nof these gigantic sentinels of the Great Gloomy Forest.\r\n\r\nBulger and I followed him! Thus it was we entered the domain of\r\nPalin-mâ-Talin, Home of Darkness. I shall not try to describe to you the\r\nsolemn stillness, the mysterious twilight of the Great Gloomy Forest,\r\nnor to paint for you the wonderful beauty of the deep green mosses which\r\ncovered rocks and trees: trailed from the swaying branches, carpeted the\r\nfloorway, or hung like heavy canopies, from tree to tree, above our\r\nheads, and increased the gloom caused by the thick, interlacing foliage.\r\n\r\nI had followed Benè-agâ’s noiseless footsteps about half a mile into the\r\nstilly depths of Palin-mâ-Talin when, I began to feel a strange chill\r\ncreep over me; beginning at my very finger tips and pursuing its\r\ninsidious way toward my very vitals. So rapidly did it run its benumbing\r\ncourse that I was upon the point of calling out to the Benè-agâ, when he\r\nhalted; and having broken a twig from a tree with foliage of dark green\r\nand polished leaves, bade me eat them, saying:\r\n\r\n“Palin-mâ-Talin does no harm to those that know him!”\r\n\r\nI found the leaves pungent and agreeable to the taste. Their effect was\r\nmagical. My limbs at once forgot their numbness and my step lost its\r\nheaviness.\r\n\r\nWe had now been several hours in the Great Gloomy Forest; and, thus far,\r\nBenè-agâ had advanced into its ever-increasing gloom—for night was\r\nfalling, without a halt.\r\n\r\nHad Benè-agâ had as many eyes as Argus and each of lynx’s power, he\r\ncould not have pursued his way thro’ Palin-mâ-Talin’s gloomy corridors\r\nmore easily and more securely. His polished wand flashed like a thing of\r\nlife in his miraculously trained hand, touching everything, vibrating,\r\nswinging, advancing, retreating, with a rapidity, that my eyes could not\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n“O, great master!” I called out to him, “let me not be presumptuous\r\nenough to speak to thee of things which should be left unstirred in the\r\nchambers of thy mind, but if it be permitted to me to know, tell me how\r\nthy rayless eyes can pierce this gloom and find a path thro’ this\r\ntrackless forest, wrapt in the gloom and silence of ten thousand years!”\r\n\r\n“It shall be as thou wishest, son;” replied the blind hermit “the little\r\nthere is to know thou shall hear! But surely, thy young limbs must be\r\nweary. First let me make ready a bed for the night and spread some food\r\nand drink!”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he swung his leathern bag off his shoulder, took from it a\r\nroll of dried skin and spread it on the ground; then, wrenching four\r\npine boughs from a tree near by, he thrust them in the earth one at each\r\ncorner of a square, and striking a spark with his tinder-box, set fire\r\nto the pitch which trickled down the boughs.\r\n\r\nThe flickering flames cast a thousand weird shadows on the trailing\r\nmosses and black shrouded trees, and filled the air with a grateful\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nBenè-agâ now drew forth some dried fruit and berries.\r\n\r\nWe ate in silence.\r\n\r\nBulger sniffed at the food but nothing more.\r\n\r\nOur frugal repast concluded, the blind hermit took from his leathern\r\npouch a sharp-pointed piece of flint with which he pierced the bark of a\r\ntree near our bivouac. Into the hole he thrust a slender reed. I was\r\nastonished to see a limpid liquid flow from the end of the reed. He\r\nfilled a gourd with it and placing the drinking vessel in my hand said\r\nin a low, caressing voice:\r\n\r\n“Drink, my son! ’Twill refresh and strengthen thee!”\r\n\r\nI raised the gourd to my lips. The liquid was cool and sweet, and very\r\npleasing to the taste.\r\n\r\n“Drink as deep as thou wilt, my son,” cried Benè-agâ, “for\r\nPalin-mâ-Talin could slake the thirst of an army.”\r\n\r\nAgain I placed the gourd to my lips. This time I drank long and deep. A\r\ngentle warmth now coursed thro’ my limbs. My eye-lids sank downward,\r\noppressed with a most delicious longing for sleep. Pillowing my head on\r\nBenè-agâ’s pouch, with my hand resting on my faithful Bulger’s head, I\r\nwas soon wrapped in slumber.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, it was still night. The pine knots had burned nearly out.\r\nThere sat the blind hermit beside me. I could see that he was keeping\r\nwatch. His head turned as I stirred.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast asked me,” he began, to tell thee how I am able to find my\r\nway thro’ Palin-mâ-Talin’s gloom. Here, in this trackless home of shadow\r\nno outward eyes would avail me aught. Thou hast seen how the floor of\r\nthis vast Temple is everywhere alike. For it, nature has woven a carpet\r\nof thick, velvet moss which, in the flight of centuries, takes on no\r\nchange of hue. ’Tis ever the same! Tear a pathway in it, in a few short\r\ndays the rent will be made whole. Blaze the trees, the encircling mosses\r\nwill, in a brief period hide the marks, and all thy labor will be in\r\nvain. Even supposing that thou couldst succeed in leaving a lasting\r\ntrail behind thee, the deadly poison which lurks in this damp air would\r\nchill thy life blood ere thou couldst cross from outer wall to outer\r\nwall of this vast Temple, with its roof of interwoven moss and foliage,\r\nimpenetrable to the noonday sun.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast felt the first touch of that deadly chill, which curdles the\r\nwarmest blood and sends a sleep of death upon the rash intruder! But to\r\nme, O, my son, Palin-mâ-Talin is all light and glow! I cannot see that\r\ngloom which strikes such terror to thy soul. And thou must know, my son,\r\nthat Palin-mâ-Talin has no shadows deep enough to hide the north star\r\nfrom my sight. I always know which way it was the sun went down, and\r\nwhich way it will be that he will rise; for all the winds are known to\r\nme, and whence they blow. To thy cheek the air appears to sleep at\r\ntimes. To mine, never! ’Tis no more a task for me to catch the\r\nbreath-like zephyr—unfelt by thee—than it is for thy faithful dog to\r\ntake up the trail of his master’s footsteps and follow it through the\r\ncrowded mart. Then again, thou must bear in mind that for a hundred\r\nyears and more I’ve been a shadowless figure in this, home of shadows;\r\nthat the trees of Palin-mâ-Talin have taken me to their hearts, and I\r\nthem to mine; that not only do I know how and where they grow, but it\r\nhath been revealed to me that these towering children of Palin-mâ-Talin\r\nare not scattered helter-skelter, here and there, in orderless manner;\r\nbut, that in a certain measure, they are ranged in lines from the rising\r\ntoward the setting sun, each species forming a belt to itself, not like\r\na grove by man’s hand planted, but in a wild, yet orderly confusion. To\r\nthee, this would be a useless guide, for thou hast seen how the trunks\r\nare swathed up in garbs of moss, and how the gloom gives all the foliage\r\nthe same deep-dark hue of green. To thine eye, here, all these trees\r\nseem alike, the countless offspring of a single sire! And yet it is not\r\nso! For, when in my progress through these lofty corridors of gloom and\r\nsilence I sway too far northward or southward, a single handful of\r\nleaves crushed in my grasp, gives up the secret of my whereabouts. But,\r\neven this sure guiding string has failed me at times, and I have gone\r\nastray in the home of my friend! And yet in such moments, Palin-mâ-Talin\r\nhad no terrors for me! When thus, an aimless wanderer in this trackless\r\nwood, I learned to draw aside this garb of green which decks\r\nPalin-mâ-Talin’s breast, and lay my hand upon his very heart!\r\n\r\n“So has kind nature sharpened my sense of feeling that by the simple\r\ntouch of the clay beneath our feet I can set my erring footsteps right\r\nand regain my lost path. Be thou, my son, in coming years, as steadfast\r\nin thy search for truth as I have been in my endeavors to change this\r\ngloom and silence into living light and speech, and thou wilt walk\r\nthrough life’s devious paths as easily as I thread my way through the\r\ntrackless chambers of Palin-mâ-Talin!”\r\n\r\nAs Benè-agâ ceased speaking, he lifted his song, making the trailing\r\nmosses sway with the vigor of his notes, now deep and solemn, now clear\r\nand far-reaching.\r\n\r\nThe echoes came back softened down to flute notes. He listened\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\n“O wonderful man!” thought I, “even the sleeping echoes rouse themselves\r\nto guide thy footsteps aright.”\r\n\r\n“Come, my son!” he cried in tones of gladness, “our torches go to their\r\nend. Let us push on! Though the sun be not yet high enough to chase the\r\ninky darkness out of Palin-mâ-Talin’s depths, still, with this guiding\r\nstring thou canst follow me!”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he placed the end of a leather thong in my hand, and we set\r\nout once more.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been an hour or so under way, the sun’s rays began so to\r\ntemper the darkness of the Great Gloomy Forest, that my eyes were of\r\nsome slight use to me!\r\n\r\nAgain Benè-agâ broke out in a wild chant, and paused to catch the echo.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” murmured the blind hermit, half in soliloquy “that was a greeting\r\nfrom the drowsy waters of Lool-pâ-Tool!”\r\n\r\nImagine the feeling of utter helplessness which came over me an hour or\r\nso later when, suddenly I found myself standing upon the banks of a\r\nbroad streamlet, of hue blacker than the wings of night, apparently\r\nstagnant; or, at least so sluggish as to seem well deserving of the\r\ntitle “Drowsy Waters.”\r\n\r\n“This is Lool-pâ-Tool!” said Benè-agâ, as he rested his chin on his hand\r\nand seemed to be gazing down on its inky surface.\r\n\r\nBut how to cross it, for no bark was moored in sight—was now the\r\nbewildering thought which oppressed my mind! Surely it cannot be forded,\r\nfor to the eye it seemed as deep as it was silent and mysterious. Nor\r\nyet, would it be otherwise than inviting death itself to plunge into its\r\nstagnant waters and swim to the other side.\r\n\r\nWhile I stood thus wrapped in a cloud of anxious thought, Benè-agâ\r\nhimself seemed scarcely less perplexed. His usual calmness had deserted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDrawing some pebbles from his leather pouch, he cast them one by one\r\ninto the stream, bending forward to catch the sound they made with\r\neager, listening air. Then turning to the right he followed the banks of\r\nLool-pâ-Tool, keeping his staff in the water and beating it gently with\r\nthe tip as if striving to draw some secret from it.\r\n\r\nAgain he paused and cast some pebbles into the dark and sluggish stream,\r\nand bent forward to get their answer. Again, he woke the echoes, and\r\nlistened breathlessly to the reply that came, only to take up the march\r\nafter a brief delay with what seemed to me a somewhat hesitating step.\r\nEvidently he was astray. His calm, noble face lost its look of serene\r\nconfidence. Suddenly halting, he reached out for a handful of foliage,\r\ncrushed the leaves in a quick and nervous grasp, inhaled their odor, and\r\nthen resumed his march as before, with head dropped forward on his\r\nbreast, and doubt and uncertainty visible in every movement.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the thought flashed thro’ my mind that possibly Benè-agâ\r\nhad gone so far astray as to make the discovery of the right course\r\nimpossible. I could feel my lips draw apart, and my heart creep slowly\r\nupward into my throat!\r\n\r\nThe thought of a lingering death from starvation in the chill, dark\r\ncorridors of Palin-mâ-Talin, set a knife in my heart.\r\n\r\nI almost tottered as I followed the blind hermit’s lead. My tongue was\r\ntoo dry to let me cry out to him in my sudden despair.\r\n\r\nWhile these terrible thoughts were chasing each other thro’ my mind,\r\nBenè-agâ halted; and, resting his staff upon the branches of the nearest\r\ntree, broke out into one of his wild invocations:\r\n\r\n“O Palin-mâ-Talin, Benè-agâ calls unto thee! Hear him! He is astray! Set\r\nhis feet in the right path! Let him not wander aimlessly about in thy\r\ngloom and silence. O, Palin-mâ-Talin! He is thy child; be kind and\r\nloving to him!”\r\n\r\nWith these words Benè-agâ threw himself upon his knees, tore away the\r\nthick covering of moss, until he had laid bare the forest floor; from\r\nthis, he took up a handful of the soil and pressed it between his\r\nfingers as if to test some secret quality.\r\n\r\nWhen he arose I knew that all was well. A radiant glow played about his\r\nfeatures. He was himself again!\r\n\r\nCatching up his wand, he broke away with mad strides, as if pursued by\r\nvery demons. Only by running could I keep within sight of him.\r\n\r\nOn! on! we sped along the banks of Lool-pâ-Tool stream of the “Drowsy\r\nWatery,” mile by mile, Benè-agâ carolling his wild chants of glad\r\nthanks, I panting as if bent upon escaping fleshless death himself.\r\nAnother hundred paces and I would have fallen headlong to the ground.\r\n\r\nMy feet seemed shod with lead.\r\n\r\nBulger set up a most piteous whining as he saw the look of despair\r\nsettling on my face.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the blind hermit halted; and, turning towards me, cried out in\r\na joyous tone:\r\n\r\n“This is the place my son. It is all over now! Fear nothing! Mount on my\r\nshoulders! Thou wilt not add a feather’s weight to the burdens which I\r\ncarry there! Be not troubled about thy dog. Lool-pâ-Tool has no terrors\r\nfor him.” Such was my confidence in the blind hermit’s power to bear me\r\nsafety across the mysterious stream that I did not wait for a second\r\nbidding to mount upon his shoulders altho’ as far as I could see, the\r\nwaters of Lool-pâ-Tool looked just as black and deep as ever. Advancing\r\nto the edge of the stream Benè-agâ now began, with quick and nervous\r\nmovement of his staff, to search for hidden stepping stones.\r\n\r\nIn vain I strained my eyes to catch some sign of resting place for his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, they were there: for with giant strides, steady, sure and\r\nrapid, Benè-agâ passed over the “Drowsy Waters” of Lool-pâ-Tool and set\r\nme safety down on the other bank. I made effort to speak my thanks. But,\r\nwonderment had robbed my tongue of power of utterance. I could only gaze\r\nin silence upon that noble face—now clad in all its former serenity—then\r\nturn and follow its owner’s footsteps.\r\n\r\nAfter a few miles further advance Benè-agâ halted, and, bending his gaze\r\nupon me, as if his eyes were as full of light as his look was of\r\nradiance, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“My son, my task is done! Look, dost thou not see that gleam of light\r\nyonder? ’Tis the outer wall of Palin-mâ-Talin. Pass it and thou wilt\r\nenter the world of noise and glare once more! Thou hast no further need\r\nof me. Go straight on; and, in a brief half hour, the sun’s rays will\r\ngreet thee again! Once outside of this pathless wood, thou wilt find\r\nthyself upon a lofty parapet—a sheer height of two hundred feet above\r\nthe plains below. Look about thee and thou wilt see a stairway of solid\r\nrock, leading downward to the plain—not such as built by hands of man,\r\nwith steps of even height, hewn regular and smooth, but a rude,\r\nfantastic flight of stairs left standing there by nature when she\r\ncleared away the mass each side. Upon these narrow steps, smoothed by\r\nthe beating storms of ten thousand years, the waters daily pour a\r\ntreacherous slime, so that those who have rashly tried to pass to the\r\nfair land below, now lie among the jagged rocks. No foot is sure enough\r\nto tread on the slippery steps of Bōga-Drappa. To fall means certain\r\ndeath. I cannot counsel thee my son. Be wary! Be wise! Farewell.”\r\n\r\nAs this last word fell from Benè-agâ’s lips he flashed out of my sight\r\nlike a spirit form.\r\n\r\nThe Palin-mâ-Talin covered him with her darkness.\r\n\r\nHe was gone.\r\n\r\nThe tears gathered in my eyes.\r\n\r\nFain would I have pressed its hand to my lips.\r\n\r\nI knew it was useless for me to try and call him back or to follow him.\r\nSo, with a heavy heart I turned and pressed forward in the direction he\r\nhad indicated.\r\n\r\nI was soon at the outer edge of Palin-mâ-Talin and to tell the truth I\r\nfelt my heavy heart grow light again. Bulger too, showed his delight at\r\nbeing once more in the warm sunshine. Breaking out into the wildest\r\nbarking he raced hither and thither with the joyous air of a boy set\r\nfree from long and irksome task.\r\n\r\nAs Benè-agâ had described to me, I now found myself standing upon a\r\nlofty parapet, overlooking a delightful valley, thro’ which I longed to\r\nwander, after my long stay in Benè-agâ’s cave and the gloomy trail\r\nthrough Palin-mâ-Talin’s depths.\r\n\r\nWalking along the edge of the cliff I was not long in coming upon the\r\nStair of the Evil Spirit or Bōga-Drappa as it was called.\r\n\r\nIt was jagged, irregular and tilted here and there; and yet, quite even\r\nand stair-like when one considered that it was of nature’s building. As\r\nthe blind hermit had warned me the treacherous slime covered\r\nBōga-Drappa’s entire length, forever renewed by the impure waters which\r\ntrickled down its steps.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to descend would have been worse than madness.\r\n\r\nNo human foot was sure enough to tread those slippery stones and reach\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was impelled by the strongest desire to hasten forward I saw\r\nthat a single rash act might end my life.\r\n\r\nOrdinary obstacles have no terror for me. But when nature sets a\r\nthreatening barrier in my way I halt, but do not surrender.\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, I sat calmly down to ponder over the problem that faced\r\nme.\r\n\r\nFor three days I tarried on this parapet and each day I visited\r\nBōga-Drappa and gazed long and fixedly upon its far-reaching flight of\r\nrocky steps.\r\n\r\nOn the third day I had solved the problem.\r\n\r\nHastily gathering up every fragment of lime-stone lying near, I piled it\r\nin a cone-shaped heap and around it and over it I laid a mass of dry\r\nleaves and billets and over all such logs as I could lift. Then,\r\nstriking fire with my flint and tinder I set the pile in flames.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I was rejoiced to find a heap of the purest quick-lime\r\nbeneath the ashes.\r\n\r\nBy means of an empty skull of some animal of the deer family, which I\r\nfound lying near, I at once began to feed the waters trickling over\r\nBōga-Drappa’s steps with the lime.\r\n\r\nAll that day and up to the noon hour of the next, I kept the water which\r\nflowed down the stairway, milk white with the lime.\r\n\r\nNow, however, came the greatest difficulty. From the size of the stream\r\nI realized that it would be impossible for me to stay its course by\r\nmeans of any dam that I could build, for a longer time than one brief\r\nhalf hour. But, I dared not wait too long, for the coating of lime,\r\nwhich, by this time I knew must have been deposited on the rocky steps,\r\nto harden in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe dam might break and undo all my work.\r\n\r\nAt high noon, when the sun was beating down the hottest, I put the last\r\ntouch to my dam. I was startled to see with what rapidity the waters\r\ngathered in the basin I had built. With anxious eyes and throbbing\r\nheart, I stood at the head of Bōga-Drappa’s stair of rock and gazed up\r\nand down.\r\n\r\nI could see no signs of drying on the black and glistening steps. One\r\nmoment after another glided by. At last a faint trace of whiteness began\r\nto show itself here and there. I turned an anxious glance at the\r\ngathering waters. The frail dam seemed about to yield to the\r\never-increasing pressure.\r\n\r\nIn one or two places, I caught glimpses of tiny rivulets trickling\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nOnce more, with a terrible feeling of faintness I glanced down the long\r\ndark flight of steps. Half blinded by the noon day sun I nevertheless\r\ncaught sight of a snow white crust on the stairway.\r\n\r\nNow was my time or never!\r\n\r\nCalling out to Bulger to precede me I sprang boldly down the stair\r\nwhich, till that moment had been black with treacherous slime. The\r\nwaters broke away and came rushing on my very heels. Down, down, I went\r\nin headlong haste, bounding like a deer from step to step!\r\n\r\nMy heart sank within me as I felt the torrent, now mad and raging\r\nspatter its spray on my neck.\r\n\r\nAnother instant and I’m saved! My feet strike firm.\r\n\r\nI see the fair country come nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nAnother leap, and with my faithful Bulger I’ve cleared the dreaded\r\nstairway of Bōga-Drappa! Staggering forward, I reach the greensward of\r\nthe valley and fall fainting, after my terrible race for life!\r\n\r\nBulger’s mingled wailing and caresses roused me after a few moments of\r\nclouded brain and then all was well. And yet a shudder stole over me as\r\nI raised my eyes to take a last look at the rocky stairway of\r\nBōga-Drappa, now clad once more in its black, glistening, treacherous\r\nslime.\r\n\r\nRefreshed by a hearty meal upon the luscious fruit which grew in\r\nwonderful profusion on every side, followed by a deep draught of cool,\r\nclear spring water, and calling joyfully to my faithful Bulger to follow\r\nme, I set out for the distant summit of the ridge which shut in this\r\npeaceful little corner of the earth’s surface, so well fitted for the\r\nhome of human beings, and yet so utterly abandoned and tenantless, even\r\nby four footed creatures. While, I am a great admirer of nature in all\r\nher aspects from wildest grandeur to picture-like delicacy, yet no spot\r\nwhich is not inhabited by man or beast, can long hold me content.\r\n\r\nI must have life, not the dull spiritless life of tree, shrub or plant,\r\never-chained to one spot, but the restive, bounding, throbbing life of\r\nman or animal to study, contemplate and reflect upon. Therefore, it was\r\nthat I determined to pass at once out of this beautiful little valley.\r\n\r\nI pushed on with eager step for I was desirous of gaining the high land\r\nbefore nightfall. In this I was successful, but the twilight had so\r\ndeepened when I reached the crest of the ridge, that any survey of the\r\ncountry lying beyond was impossible.\r\n\r\nShortly after I had lighted a bivouac fire, Bulger came in with a\r\nbird—of the quail kind—and I proceeded to broil it on the live embers.\r\n\r\nThe faithful animal was delighted to be once more in a country in which\r\nhe could serve me and while our supper was cooking, took occasion to go\r\nthrough a number of his old tricks, in order to see his little master’s\r\nface brighten up.\r\n\r\nSide by side, we lay down for the night in that far-away land, and were\r\nsoon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe morning broke with rare splendor. I hastened to examine the country\r\nbeneath me. It was dotted here and there by groves and bits of woodland\r\nand seemed unusually green and fruitful.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted my attention more than anything else was the fact that,\r\nas far as my eye could reach, the region was watered by a perfect\r\nnetwork of little rivers, which glistened in the morning sun like bands\r\nof burnished silver.\r\n\r\nI had never seen the like. It occurred to me at once, that should these\r\nstreams prove too deep and rapid to ford, it would force me to change my\r\ncourse entirely, and pass either to the north or south, until I reached\r\na clear country. It was pretty well toward sundown when I stood upon the\r\nconfines of this strange land which I named Polypotamo or “Many Rivers.”\r\nThe streams, which varied from ten to twenty feet in width, were deep,\r\nclear and swift.\r\n\r\nAs you may readily imagine such a country was very productive. Fruit and\r\nflower-bearing shrubs and trees, all of a most beautiful green grew in\r\nthe wildest abundance. The air, cooled and purified as it was by the\r\nnumerous streams of limpid water, was like a magic inhalation, carrying\r\na strange feeling of dreamy delight to every part of the body.\r\n\r\nSaid I to myself:\r\n\r\n“If this fair land be not inhabited then it is a monstrous pity, for\r\nhere kind nature has spread her riches with a more than usually lavish\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\nBulger and I stretched ourselves upon the bank of the first stream that\r\nwe reached and were preparing for a nap after our long days tramp, when\r\nsuddenly the strangest noises reached our ears. He started up with a\r\nlook of mingled alarm and curiosity which, could I have seen my own\r\nface, I would undoubtedly have found pictured there in equally strong\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nLouder and louder grew these curious sounds.\r\n\r\nI listened with pricked-up ears, as I strained my eyes in the direction\r\nwhence they came, eager to catch the first glimpse of the beings who\r\nuttered them.\r\n\r\nI had not long to wait. About an eighth of a mile away, my eyes fell\r\nupon a sight, which, in spite of the possible dangers threatening my\r\nlife, in case these creatures had proven to be vicious or savage, caused\r\nme to burst out into a fit of uncontrollable laughter.\r\n\r\nThere, in full view, was a troop of human creatures, dwarfish in\r\nstature—not being much over four feet in height—who seemed incapable of\r\nusing their legs as we do; but moved about from one place to another by\r\nhopping, as some birds do, or as rabbits would do if they moved about\r\nstanding upright on their hind legs.\r\n\r\nIn an instant they caught the sound of my voice; and, with the swiftness\r\nof the wind, and with an ease that astounded me, leaped over the two\r\nintervening streams—each of which was at least fifteen feet in width—and\r\ncame bounding toward us with the same gigantic leaps! The whole thing\r\nwas done so quickly, and the mode of locomotion was so novel and\r\naltogether wonderful, that I was surrounded before I knew what happened\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that I couldn’t understand their language,\r\nalthough I soon mastered it, consisting as it did of pure Aryan roots,\r\nno word being of more than three letters.\r\n\r\nThe Man-Hoppers—such was my translation of their name, Umi-Lobas—ranged\r\nthemselves in a circle around Bulger and me, threw themselves on their\r\nfaces, so to speak—for their arms were ridiculously out of all\r\nproportion to their bodies—and threatened with shrill outcries and\r\nmenacing movements, to kick Bulger and me to death instantly unless we\r\nsurrendered unconditionally.\r\n\r\nIt was a novel sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JOLLY PARTY OF UMI LOBAS (MAN HOPPERS) THAT CAPTURED\r\nBULGER AND ME.]\r\n\r\nBulger was inclined to advise resistance; but, when I had given a\r\nhurried glance at their feet, which were very large and attached to\r\nastonishingly vigorous legs, I deemed it only prudent to run up the\r\nwhite flag; in fact, I gave them to understand that we threw ourselves\r\non their mercy.\r\n\r\nBut first, a word about these strange people:\r\n\r\nThey were, as I have said, small of stature, and let me add that, upon\r\ntheir narrow, sloping shoulders were set delicate, doll-like heads,\r\nanimated by large, lustrous, black eyes of extreme softness in\r\nexpression. Their arms looked like the arms of a boy on the body of a\r\nman. But, although so small, for they reached only to their waists and\r\nended in tiny, shapely hands, yet they showed themselves possessed of\r\nextraordinary strength and dexterity. Their legs, however, were the most\r\nwonderful part of them.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I might almost say that the Umi-Lobas were all legs, so out of\r\nall proportion was the development of their limbs. The effect of this\r\ndisproportion may be easily imagined. It so dwarfed their bodies that\r\nthey appeared like cones set upon two legs.\r\n\r\n“Miscreant!” cried the leader, as I learned three days later when I had\r\nmastered their language, “if thou dost not instantly admit that his\r\nmajesty, Gâ-roo, King of the Umi-Lobas, is not the fastest, farthest and\r\nmost graceful jumper in the world, thou shalt be kicked to death without\r\nthe least ceremony!”\r\n\r\nI made signs that I was quite willing to admit this, although I didn’t\r\nunderstand exactly what it was!\r\n\r\nSeeing that I was not disposed to attempt any harm, the Man-Hoppers\r\nsprang to their feet and seated themselves in a perfect ring around\r\nBulger and me, like so many rabbits when standing on their hind feet to\r\nreach something, intent upon getting a good look at us, or at me rather,\r\nfor Bulger was evidently no great novelty for them.\r\n\r\nThey kept up a perfect rattle of remarks in shrill piping tones upon my\r\npersonal appearance. I, too, was by no means idle.\r\n\r\nI kept even pace with their galloping curiosity, studying the expression\r\nof their faces and the movements of their bodies. After a few moments I\r\nwas given to understand that I must start at once for the palace of\r\ntheir gracious monarch, Gâ-roo, the One Thousandth, for they were a very\r\nancient people.\r\n\r\nAs I rose to my feet and took a few steps toward the water, intending to\r\nassure them that I could not leap across the stream, it became their\r\nturn to laugh.\r\n\r\nAnd laugh they did too, with such spirit, such heartiness—I might almost\r\nsay such violence—that I never realized till then that they laugh best\r\nwho laugh last.\r\n\r\nAgain and again their piping, pygmy voices broke out in shrill chorus\r\nwhile their pretty doll faces were convulsed with merriment.\r\n\r\nBulger repeatedly showed his teeth, and gave vent to short, spiteful\r\nbarks as the Umi-Lobas continued their, to him, unseemly behavior. But I\r\nknew it would only injure us in the end, if I showed any signs of anger,\r\nso I simply shrugged my shoulders and waited for them to recover from\r\ntheir fit of merriment. Finally, between the pauses of laughter I caught\r\nsuch words as:\r\n\r\n“Pendulum-legs!”\r\n\r\n“Man-scissors!”\r\n\r\n“Man Tongs!”\r\n\r\n“Flip-flop! Wiggle-waggle!”\r\n\r\n“Here she goes, there she goes!”\r\n\r\nSuch were a few of the terms expressive of the impression which my poor\r\nunoffending legs made upon the minds of the Umi-Lobas.\r\n\r\nThey quieted down at last and again began to make signs that I should\r\nprepare to follow them.\r\n\r\nWhen at last I succeeded in making them understand that I was not a\r\njumper, and could no more leap across the stream in front of us than I\r\ncould hop over the moon, their mirth now gave place to disgust. Such\r\npleasant phrases as:—\r\n\r\n“Lead legs!”\r\n\r\n“Two-legged snail!”\r\n\r\n“Little man stuck-in-the-ground!”\r\n\r\n“Little man tied-to-his-head!” etc., etc., were fired at me.\r\n\r\nAfter a consultation, it was determined to dispatch two of their number\r\nfor a sort of porte-chaise in use among the Umi-Lobas in which to\r\ntransport Bulger and me to the King’s palace.\r\n\r\nAway went the messengers like the wind, in leaps of twenty feet seeming\r\nscarcely to touch the ground, bounding along in the distance like pith\r\nballs. After a short delay they reappeared bearing, slung on a sort of\r\nyoke resting upon their shoulders, a stout wicker basket.\r\n\r\nBulger and I were invited to step into it; the cover was closed and\r\nsecurely fastened by a stout leathern thong. Then with a bumpety bump\r\nsort of motion away we went across land and water.\r\n\r\nBulger whined piteously and fixed his lustrous eyes upon me, as if to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n“Little master, if they are transporting us to torture or death I’m glad\r\nI am with thee!”\r\n\r\nI soon gave him to understand that there was no danger.\r\n\r\nHe returned my caresses and we both awaited further developments. It\r\nseems that the two Man-Hoppers who had been sent for the porte-chaise\r\nhad spread the news of their strange capture, so the whole town was on\r\nthe watch for our arrival.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to a full stop. The basket was set down on the ground\r\nand the leathern thong loosened. To tell the truth, I was as anxious to\r\nsee as they were.\r\n\r\nA terrible hubbub was in progress, those in authority having seemingly\r\nlost all control over the pushing, pulling, scrambling mass of\r\nUmi-Lobas. With such violent outcries and still more violent gestures\r\ndid they gather about us, that I began to fear that they would overturn\r\nour carriage and do Bulger and me some real injury, in their mad\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice, louder and shriller than all the rest, called out:\r\n\r\n“Silence! His majesty, Gâ-roo, the Thousandth, King of the Umi-Lobas, is\r\napproaching. Down! Down! Silence! Fall back!”\r\n\r\nOne of the attendants now raised the lid of our basket and courteously\r\ninvited me to step out.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to give the thing a thought, I seized the leathern\r\nthong, sprang lightly up and threw one of my legs over the side of the\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\nInstantly there was an outburst of shrill, ear-piercing exclamations of\r\nwonder, fear, surprise, horror, delight and I don’t know how many other\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was startled, and half inclined to make my way back into\r\nmy basket again. Suddenly, however, it occurred to me what it all meant.\r\n\r\nThe Umi-Lobas being able to move their legs only backward and forward,\r\nand utterly incapable of moving one leg without the other, were about as\r\nmuch astonished at seeing one of my legs come flopping over the side of\r\nthe basket, as I would be if you should throw one of your legs out\r\nsidewise and strike your foot against your shoulder.\r\n\r\nAs I sprang lightly to the ground and took a few steps towards King\r\nGâ-roo, who stood surrounded by his court officials, a very lean\r\nUmi-Loba on one side of him and a very fat one on the other—a perfect\r\nwhirlwind of such cries as: “Pendulum-legs” “Walking-Scissors!”\r\n“Measuring-Man!” “Little Man All Head!” etc., etc., burst forth.\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo received me very pleasantly; requesting me to walk, run, hop\r\non one foot, cross my legs, he, standing with wide opened eyes as I went\r\nthrough my paces to please him.\r\n\r\nHe then asked me my name, my rank at home, my profession, my age, what I\r\nliked to eat and drink, how much heavier my head was than my body, etc.,\r\netc. I made such a good impression on the King of the Umi-Lobas that he\r\nturned and invited me to spend some time at his palace.\r\n\r\nI was delighted, for I was very desirous of studying the manners and\r\ncustoms of these strange people, and of conversing with their learned\r\nmen. Suddenly, there was a great change manifest in the King’s manner\r\ntoward me. He listened with knitted brows and compressed lips, first to\r\nhis fat counsellor and then to his lean one.\r\n\r\nHis lean minister, so lean that he appeared to me to be an animated\r\nsteel spring snapping apart, was named, Megâ-Zaltô or “Great Jumper,”\r\nthan the King himself no one being able to leap across a broader stream.\r\n\r\nHis fat minister, so fat that he was able to advance only by little hops\r\nof a few inches at a time, was named Migrô-Zaltô, or “Small Jumper,” and\r\nas he had for many years been unable to race about the country like the\r\nother Umi-Lobas and had consequently had much time on his hands, which\r\nhe had used to improve his mind reading and studying, until he had\r\nacquired great wisdom. Hence King Gâ-roo’s choice of him as royal\r\nminister and court adviser.\r\n\r\nI was again ordered to stand in front of his majesty, the ruler of all\r\nthe Umi-Lobas.\r\n\r\n“Sir Pendulum-legs!” said he, “upon reflection, I am persuaded that thy\r\nvisit to my dominions bodes no good. Thou must know that I have two\r\nprivy councillors, to whose advice I always listen and then do as I see\r\nfit. His excellency Megâ-Zaltô,” continued King Gâ-roo, pointing to his\r\nlean minister, “counsels me to command that thou be stamped and kicked\r\nto death at once, saying that thou wilt work great injury among my\r\npeople; thou being a foreigner from a far-away land, they will endeavor\r\nto imitate thy manner of walking. Our good old-fashioned ways of walking\r\nwill be sneered at; and my people’s legs will soon lose their wonderful\r\nstrength and activity.\r\n\r\n“My other councillor, who is a very learned man and loves to discuss\r\nquestions of race, manners and customs with strangers, advises me to let\r\nthee live for several weeks, at least, until he has had an opportunity\r\nto get some valuable information from thee. Now, I am a quiet and\r\npeace-loving King, for nature by surrounding my dominions with such a\r\nnetwork of rivers, and giving us the power to leap over them, makes it\r\nnext to impossible for an enemy to follow us. Therefore, Little Man All\r\nHead, it is my royal will that for the present no harm come to thee!”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, most powerful and graceful jumper in this or any other world!”\r\nsaid I, with a very low bow. “I accept my life at thy hands in order to\r\nuse it to make known thy goodness and greatness in every land I shall\r\npass through.”\r\n\r\nMy delicate flattery touched King Gâ-roo very perceptibly. He smiled and\r\nnodded his little doll head in the friendliest manner. But Megâ-Zaltô’s\r\nfierce, little face was screwed up in a thousand wrinkles. I felt within\r\nme that he was firmly resolved to do me injury.\r\n\r\nNow, there was another interruption. A shrill, piping baby-voice\r\nsuddenly rang out in a series of angry screams, while a score of other\r\nvoices in soft, soothing tones could be heard as if endeavoring to\r\ncomfort the screamer.\r\n\r\nI turned my eyes in the direction of the voices. To my surprise and\r\ndelight I saw coming towards me one of the female Umi-Lobas, advancing\r\ntimidly with light and graceful hops, like a sparrow on the greensward.\r\nHer head and face looked for all the world like some of the wax dolls I\r\nhad seen in Paris, only she was a trifle paler than they.\r\n\r\nIt was the beautiful princess, Hoppâ-Hoppâ. She seemed to be in a very\r\nfretful and petulant humor, and showed her peevishness in every\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nNothing pleased her. She pouted, hung her head, and threw her baby-arms\r\nabout, upon the most trivial provocation.\r\n\r\nAs I learned afterwards, this all proceeded from her unwillingness to\r\nmarry the lean, bony Megâ-Zaltô, who was violently in love with her, and\r\nto whom the King, in a moment of some great contentment, had rashly\r\npromised the princess in marriage, and as King Gâ-roo had in doing so\r\ntaken the Umi-Lobas’ vow: “May I never be able to jump farther than the\r\nlength of my nose, if I break my vow,” he dared not break his word, and,\r\nof course, the old, thin, bony, wrinkled Megâ-Zaltô insisted upon his\r\nsticking to the bargain.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all this was to throw the beautiful princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ\r\ninto a deep melancholy. In fact, she refused absolutely to partake of\r\nany food for so long a while that everybody said sadly, “She will die!”\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo was beside himself with grief. But, as Megâ-Zaltô had no\r\nblood, he couldn’t feel any pity for either father or daughter, and\r\ninsisted that the King should stick to his bargain with him.\r\n\r\nLed on at last by the rich reward offered by King Gâ-roo to any\r\nphysician who could succeed in making princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ partake of\r\nfood, one of the court physicians hit upon the following plan:\r\n\r\nThe attendants were directed to set a table in the princess’ apartment,\r\nand load it down with her favorite dishes. Then the lady-in-waiting was\r\ninstructed to bind a silk band around the princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ’s body,\r\nwhen the latter retired for the night, so arranged that it should press\r\ngently, but continuously on the sympathetic nerve, and cause her to walk\r\nin her sleep.\r\n\r\nThe plan worked successfully. Every night about midnight princess\r\nHoppâ-Hoppâ would rise from her bed, while in the deepest sleep, sit\r\ndown at the table and partake of a hearty meal. After which she returned\r\nto bed, when one of the ladies of the bed-chamber immediately loosened\r\nthe silken band, lest she might arise the second time and overeat\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nPrincess Hoppâ-Hoppâ advanced towards me, hopping along with a timid\r\nair, until she was close enough to get a good look at me.\r\n\r\nI was then desired to go through my paces once more, which I did with a\r\ngreat deal of vigor, concluding the performance by sitting down and\r\ncrossing my legs.\r\n\r\nHoppâ-Hoppâ smiled faintly at first; but, when it came to the\r\nleg-crossing feat, she clapped her little doll hands and broke out in a\r\nlaugh about as loud as the low notes of a flute.\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo was crazed with joy. It was the first time Hoppâ-Hoppâ had\r\nlaughed for a year. I could see that there was a hurried consultation\r\ngoing on between King Gâ-roo and his fat and lean ministers. I knew only\r\ntoo well what it all meant. But princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ interrupted the\r\nconsultation, and solved the whole question herself by crying out like a\r\nspoilt child clamoring for a toy, “I want him!”\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo burst forth into a loud laugh, in which everyone joined,\r\nsave the lean, rattle-jointed Megâ-Zaltô, who scowled fiercely at me,\r\nscrewing his little face up like a dried apple.\r\n\r\n“He is thine; take him, beloved daughter,” exclaimed King Gâ-roo gayly,\r\n“and if he can cure thy melancholy and make thee once more the joy and\r\nsunshine of our Court, no one of the glorious gems which deck our royal\r\ndiadem shall be too good for him.”\r\n\r\nAmid great rejoicing and loud huzzas, a silk cord was tied about my body\r\nand I was led away by the beautiful princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ. Bulger\r\nresented the indignity of tying a cord around my waist and came within\r\nan ace of setting his teeth in the thick leg of the attendant who\r\nperformed that service for me. Growling and showing his teeth right and\r\nleft, the poor, puzzled animal followed me to prison; I say to prison,\r\nfor that was what it proved to be.\r\n\r\nNight and day, a guard surrounded my apartments and kept within\r\nrespectful distance when I was summoned to divert the gentle princess by\r\nrunning, hopping on one foot, walking with my toes turned out or in, or\r\nwith my feet stretched far apart.\r\n\r\nBut the one thing which delighted the princess and chased the melancholy\r\nfrom the pretty doll face was my ability to cross my legs. This\r\nwonderful feat I was obliged to repeat and repeat until my limbs fairly\r\nached; but no matter how often repeated to the gentle Hoppâ-Hoppâ it was\r\never new and wonderful, and she invariably rewarded me by smiling and\r\nclapping her baby-hands.\r\n\r\nAbout this time it was that my beloved brother Bulger gave me another\r\nproof of his deep affection and most extraordinary intelligence. I had\r\nno sooner begun to prepare for bed than I noticed that something was the\r\nmatter with him. He fixed his lustrous black eyes pleadingly upon me,\r\nbit my shoe playfully, tugged at my clothing, sprang upon me, then\r\nbounded off toward the bed, sniffed at it, growled in unfeigned anger,\r\nand then making his way back to me, began to tease and worry me once\r\nmore. I was half inclined to get provoked. By turns I scolded and petted\r\nhim. All to no purpose; he continued his strange actions, growing, if\r\nanything, more and more violent in his manner. At last I was ready for\r\nbed. Striving with all my power to quiet and console him, I made an\r\neffort to throw myself on my bed, so that he might leap up and lie down\r\nbeside me.\r\n\r\nBut no, it was impossible. With grip of iron he laid hold of my\r\nnight-robe and held me firmly fast, whining and crying most piteously,\r\nas if to say,\r\n\r\n“O, loved little master, why is it that thou canst not understand me?”\r\n\r\nSuddenly a strange thought flashed across my mind. I stooped and glanced\r\nunder my couch.\r\n\r\nNothing seemed amiss.\r\n\r\nThen, as if urged on by some unseen hand, I seized the bed-clothing and\r\nhurled it on the floor. Lo, the mystery was solved! There, hidden\r\nbeneath the drapery, shone the tips of a dozen or more tiny blades, each\r\nsharper than a needle’s point, and as I found upon examination, stained\r\nwith a poison so subtle that the slightest prick would have robbed me of\r\nlife. Need that I tell you how the tears burst forth, how I flung myself\r\nupon my knees and caught that beloved animal in my arms, covering him\r\nwith kisses?\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied.\r\n\r\nAgain, had he added to that long list of debts due him from me—debts\r\nonly to be discharged in coin fresh and bright from the heart’s mint. As\r\nyou have doubtless guessed, this cowardly and cruel attempt on my life\r\nwas the work of that living coil of steel springs, Megâ-Zaltô, who had\r\ndetermined to put out of the way the hated foreigner, whose monstrous\r\ndeformities were so pleasing to the being he loved.\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo was greatly incensed when, upon Bulger’s recognition of the\r\nwould-be murderer in the presence of the whole Court, the miserable\r\nwretch made a clean breast of it, and related how he had arranged the\r\nknives with his own hands.\r\n\r\n“Out of my sight, thou unworthy servant! If I do not command that thy\r\nvile heart and viler head be parted by the executioner’s axe, it is\r\nbecause thy father rendered mine priceless services. Go! Come not again\r\nuntil I summon thee!”\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo now took me into special favor.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he was delighted to see how successful my efforts\r\nhad been to amuse the princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ, on whose baby cheeks the\r\nroses glowed once more, and whose child-voice rang out again as of old,\r\nlike a flute note or a tiny silver bell.\r\n\r\nHis majesty ordered that the Court painter should forthwith make a\r\nportrait of Bulger for the royal gallery, and that a plaster cast of my\r\nhead should be taken for the royal museum.\r\n\r\nI was much pleased with all this attention.\r\n\r\nBut I noticed that the very moment I hinted at the necessity of my\r\nspeedy return home, King Gâ-roo skillfully turned the conversation to\r\nsome other subject. The fact of the matter was, he feared to have me\r\nleave the palace lest his beloved Hoppâ-Hoppâ should miss my daily\r\nperformances and fall back again into her melancholy.\r\n\r\nThe little princess herself was not slow in exerting her power over me.\r\nSnapping the ground with her feet, like a rabbit, when I failed to be\r\nquite as entertaining as usual, and even going so far as to threaten me\r\nwith a dose of that living coil of steel-spring, called Megâ-Zaltô, when\r\nI refused to cross my legs and uncross them quickly enough to please her\r\nladyship.\r\n\r\nOne day, being in a sort of brown study, over my position, and revolving\r\nin my mind several different ways of making my escape from King Gâ-roo’s\r\ndominions, I unwittingly paid little attention to Hoppâ-Hoppâ’s\r\ncommands. In vain she stormed, snapping the ground with her little feet,\r\nshaking her baby hands at me, piping out in shrill and angry tones at my\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\nI didn’t quicken my pace one jot. A heavy load of thoughts oppressed my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nMy heart was full of sorrow.\r\n\r\nAll that day I had been thinking of home, of the dear old baron and the\r\ngentle baroness, my mother, and wondering whether they missed me at the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nSuddenly came a messenger from King Gâ-roo summoning me at once to go to\r\nthe audience chamber.\r\n\r\nWith a bound I came to myself.\r\n\r\nThe little princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ had gone to her apartments.\r\n\r\nI started to call her back.\r\n\r\nEvery instant I expected to hear that little bundle of bones and\r\nmalevolence jump out at me like a venomous toad.\r\n\r\nWith fear and trembling I betook me to the King’s chamber.\r\n\r\nTo my unspeakable delight his majesty, the ruler of the Umi-Lobas, was\r\nin the rosiest of humors.\r\n\r\nHe met me with outstretched hands, poured out a beaker of wine for me,\r\nand bade me sit down at the very foot of the throne.\r\n\r\nI strove in vain to stammer out my thanks.\r\n\r\nHe would not hear a word of them; said that “the stream should flow the\r\nother way,” meaning that I was the one to be thanked.\r\n\r\n“Now, little man all head,” began the King, after I had finished my\r\nwine, “I have sent for thee to try and make thee happy, in the same\r\nmeasure as thou hast contributed to my happiness. This day I speak to\r\nthee from a father’s heart. Thou hast restored my darling child to\r\nhealth and contentment, and remembering from my conversations with thee\r\nthat thou art a great lover of rare and useful books, I have had copies\r\nmade of every book on the shelves of the royal library, and I now beg\r\nthee to accept them as a very slight token of my gratitude.”\r\n\r\nI was speechless.\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed fast and hot to my cheeks.\r\n\r\nI stammered out a few senseless words of protest, thanks, surprise, and\r\nwhat not.\r\n\r\nThe plan seemed to me only too plainly a scheme to tie me in King\r\nGâ-roo’s service, to load me with several thousand volumes which I would\r\nhave no possible means of carrying with me, and which, to leave behind\r\nwould be such an insult that arrest and imprisonment would most surely\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nAt last I succeeded in getting myself together in some shape, and spake\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“O, most powerful, wonderful and graceful jumper of all the Umi-Lobas,\r\nGâ-roo, thousandth of thy line, I implore thee do not load me down with\r\nsuch a vast and priceless treasure. Thou knowest I am but a sojourner\r\nfor a brief term in thy kingdom; I have no caravan, when I go hence to\r\ntransport this vast accumulation of wisdom, stored in so many thousands\r\nof thick and bulky volumes, steel-clasped and iron-hinged. Thy gift is\r\nfar too princely for so humble a visitor as I. Therefore, most gracious\r\nKing Gâ-roo, bestow it upon some wealthy noble of thy land, in whose\r\nspacious castle halls these books may find a safe resting-place, shelf\r\nrising on shelf, a very fortress of learning, impregnable to the cohorts\r\nof ignorance.”\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo smiled.\r\n\r\nThen, turning to an attendant, he said:\r\n\r\n“Summon Poly-dotto to attend before me, and bid him bring the library\r\nwith him.”\r\n\r\nI was more puzzled than ever by this command.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the door swung open, and an aged Umi-Loba, well bent\r\nwith years, with long tufts of white hair growing from his ears—for\r\nthese people do not permit hair to grow upon their faces, plucking it\r\nout and destroying its roots in early life—and carrying a single volume\r\nof goodly size under his arm.\r\n\r\nHe advanced with feeble hops, steadying himself upon a staff.\r\n\r\nHis voice brought a smile to my face in spite of myself, for it whistled\r\nlike a flute, unskilfully stopped, and ever and anon broke out into a\r\nfunny squeak.\r\n\r\nBut although infirm of body, Poly-dotto was a perfect wonder of mind and\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nI was fairly startled to find that Poly-dotto could understand my\r\nlanguage with perfect ease, not a thing to startle one, either, when we\r\nstop to think that all our European tongues originated in this part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nPoly-dotto hopped forward, made an attempt to bend his body more than it\r\nwas, thrust the long, white tufts of hair growing from his ears into the\r\nbosom of his garb, and placed the book he had brought with him into King\r\nGâ-roo’s hands.\r\n\r\nHis majesty returned the salutation of the aged sage, and then, bending\r\na look upon me, beckoned to me to draw near.\r\n\r\nI obeyed.\r\n\r\n“Receive, Sir Pendulum-legs,” cried King Gâ-roo, “as a mark of my\r\naffection and a proof of my gratitude, this complete and perfect\r\ntranscript of the entire royal library, for many centuries the pride of\r\nthe Kings of the Umi-Lobas.”\r\n\r\nI glanced at King Gâ-roo, then at the back of the book thinking that it\r\nwas merely the catalogue of the books contained in the royal library.\r\n\r\nBut, no; there was the title, “Complete Transcript,” etc.\r\n\r\nI opened the book.\r\n\r\nIts pages were thinner than the finest tissue I had ever seen.\r\n\r\nI turned to the last page.\r\n\r\nTwenty thousand pages!\r\n\r\nMy astonishment was redoubled.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty, on account of my unskilled fingers, I turned over\r\nsome pages here and there. They were all closely filled with minute dots\r\nand strokes.\r\n\r\nTo my eye, one page seemed like another, a bewildering repetition of\r\nthese same little dots and strokes.\r\n\r\nI looked up at King Gâ-roo and Poly-dotto. They were both much amused\r\nover my confusion.\r\n\r\nLike a flash the truth burst upon me. It seemed to me like waking from a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nYes, there was no doubt of it. I was that moment in the land of the\r\noriginal short-hand writers. Here had arisen that mysterious system of\r\nrecording language by means of dots and strokes, of which so many men,\r\nin so many different countries, in different centuries, had claimed to\r\nbe the inventors.\r\n\r\nIn my readings of ancient peoples I had often seen it darkly hinted at,\r\nthat far, far back in remote ages there existed a race of beings, with\r\nshort arms and tiny hands, who had invented a written language to suit\r\ntheir wants, in which absolutely no letters at all were used, the words\r\nbeing represented by dots and strokes placed at different heights to\r\ndenote different sounds.\r\n\r\nWith a sort of breathless delight I now sat down and began to examine\r\nthe book anew, pausing every now and then to repeat a few words of\r\nthanks to the King of the Umi-Lobas.\r\n\r\n“Inform little man all head, most learned Poly-dotto,” cried the King,\r\n“how many volumes he holds in his hand.”\r\n\r\nPoly-dotto caressed the white tufts hanging from his ears, and spake as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“The royal library which thou holdest in thy hand, contains eight\r\nthousand volumes all rare and valuable, and only to be found in the\r\nlibrary of our royal master. These volumes treat of astrology, alchemy,\r\ndivination, cheirosophy, medicine, mathematics, law, politics,\r\nphilosophy, pastimes, warfare, fifty volumes of poetry, fifty of\r\nhistory, fifty of wonder-stories, besides several hundred treatises on\r\ntheosophy, altruism, positivism, hypnotism, mind-reading, transmigration\r\nof souls, art of flying, embalming etc., etc.!”\r\n\r\n“O, wonderful! Most wonderful!” was my ejaculation.\r\n\r\n“But I beseech thee, O, learned Poly-dotto,” I continued, “impart to me\r\nthe secret of all this! Unfold to me the origin of this most wonderful\r\nsystem of writing whereby the wisdom of ages may be recorded in one\r\nsmall volume!”\r\n\r\nPoly-dotto glanced at the king, who bowed his head in sign of his royal\r\nconsent that the aged sage might speak.\r\n\r\n“Where we now stand,” began Poly-dotto, tossing back the long tufts of\r\nwhite hair which reached from his ears to his shoulders, “was once a\r\nrugged and mountainous country. In those days, now some thirty thousand\r\nyears ago, our people were more like thine than at present. To climb the\r\nrocky sides of these mountains required long, sinewy arms and strong\r\nhands of great grasping power, and flexible legs, moving quite\r\nindependently of each other, like mountaineers in all lands. But, all of\r\na sudden, these rock-crested heights began to sink and the valleys to\r\nrise; true, very slowly and gradually, but yet uninterruptedly, so that\r\nin a few years, what had been a rough, broken country, ridged and\r\nwrinkled, began to take on the aspect of a perfectly level land. With\r\nthese changes our people began to change.\r\n\r\n“Having no longer any use for hands of iron grip and arms of tireless\r\nmuscles, they were not long in finding out that this strength was\r\nleaving them, that their great breadth of shoulder and depth of chest\r\nwere slowly but surely disappearing in their sons and grandsons. By a\r\nstrange fatality, about this time, a terrible flood passed over our\r\nluckless land. Our panic-stricken people had just time enough to escape.\r\nFor several months the regions once inhabited by a contented little\r\nnation were covered by water many fathoms deep. When, at last, the\r\nwaters had subsided, and our ancestors were permitted to set foot again\r\non their native soil, what a change met their eyes! This vast domain of\r\nour gracious master, King Gâ-roo—the Thousandth, had become as you now\r\nsee it, a perfectly level plain, net-worked by the countless narrow but\r\ndeep and swift-rolling streams. But the soil brought in the arms, so to\r\nspeak, of these raging waters and cast upon our houses, burying them far\r\nbeneath, was of most extraordinary fertility, just as you see it now.\r\nEvery manner of plant, fruit, flower, vegetable and grain grows here\r\nwithout cultivation when once planted. Our people were not slow to take\r\nadvantage of Nature’s kindness and build up once more the happy homes\r\ndestroyed by the flood. But now we were brought face to face with a most\r\nwonderful state of things. Here we were shut in, surrounded by a vast\r\nnetwork of streams, and yet taught by our terrible experience so to\r\ndread water, that not even to escape from death itself could our people\r\nbe induced to swim across one of these little rivers or pass over it in\r\nany sort of boat. Time went on. It was either a question of living on\r\nthese long narrow necks of land, and walking scores of miles to pass\r\naround the bends and curves of the streams, or else jump over them. Our\r\nwise men issued instructions to our forefathers, telling them how from\r\nearly childhood they must train their little ones to leap, encouraging\r\nthem by rewards to keep up the practice until leaping became as easy to\r\nthem as walking and running had been. The royal ancestors of our most\r\ngracious master enacted most stringent laws against walking and running.\r\nIn a few generations great changes took place. It was not an unusual\r\nthing to see a child of eight or ten leap six or eight feet over\r\nrivulets while playing some game like your hide and seek. As these\r\nchild-hoppers increased in years, their power of leaping soon led them\r\nto see that they could advance much more rapidly by jumping than by the\r\nancient, toilsome way of setting first one and then the other foot\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n“The streams now widened, putting the leaping powers of our people to\r\nsevere tests. But we overcame every obstacle, and in a few generations\r\nit became a rare thing indeed to see a Umi-Loba moving about in the\r\nancient manner. As you may easily imagine, Nature could not furnish\r\nvigor enough to enable our people to transform themselves in this\r\nmanner, and at the same time preserve their length, strength and power\r\nof shoulders, arms and hands. A most astonishing result showed itself.\r\nWhat was gained below was lost above. Our people’s arms began to grow\r\nflabby; their hands took on a delicate and nerveless appearance, as if a\r\nlong illness had bleached and softened them. Then the wise men of our\r\nnation noticed another change. After a certain age, the arms of our\r\nchildren ceased growing entirely, and although our physicians made\r\nextraordinary efforts to overcome this sudden stoppage of growth, which\r\nusually occurred when our children reached their tenth year, yet all\r\ntheir exertions were of no avail.\r\n\r\n“Our king, to his great dismay, saw growing up about him a race of young\r\nmen whose arms were so short, and whose hands were so small and\r\ndelicate, that they could no longer wield the spears and bows and arrows\r\nof our forefathers. Even the knives and forks and drinking cups had to\r\nbe made smaller and smaller as these wonderful changes came about.\r\n\r\n“And not long, too, was it before our wise men found it utterly\r\nimpossible to hold and guide the long, heavy pens of their ancestors, or\r\nto lift the ponderous volumes in which our fathers had kept the records\r\nof our nation.\r\n\r\n“With smaller pens came smaller books, and finer writing, until at last\r\none of my ancestors, in a moment of happy inspiration, conceived the\r\nidea of giving up the ancient way of writing by means of two score or\r\nmore of letters, so large that only a few of them could be written upon\r\none line, and of which two or three were necessary in order to record\r\none simple sound, and of using little dots and strokes as fine as hairs,\r\nto represent the sound of our words.\r\n\r\n“Our children were delighted.\r\n\r\n“Their short arms and tiny hands were well fitted for such work.\r\n\r\n“In a few years the new system of writing was taught in all our schools,\r\nand by royal edict became the only lawful method of writing throughout\r\nthe kingdom. Later, another of my ancestors greatly improved the system,\r\nso simplifying it that whole sentences could be recorded by a single\r\ntiny dot or hair-stroke.\r\n\r\n“By means of this wonderful system is it that we are enabled to compress\r\na whole library into one single book, as you have seen, and to make it\r\npossible for our royal master to carry about with him on his journeys\r\nthe assorted wisdom of ages, in so compact a form that it may be placed\r\nunder the royal pillow and yet not wrinkle it.\r\n\r\n“Thou knowest full well,” continued Poly-dotto, with a smile, as he\r\nraised one of his baby hands and pointed a tiny finger at the book I\r\nheld in my hands, and upon whose pages my eyes were fixed in wide-opened\r\nastonishment, “that in thy country a story writer could not possibly\r\nsqueeze a single one of his tales between those covers!”\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo laughed heartily at this speech.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments more of pleasant chat, I was dismissed by his\r\nmajesty with promises of continued favor.\r\n\r\nAs I was backing out of the audience chamber, King Gâ-roo cried out\r\ngayly, as he shook a tiny finger at me:\r\n\r\n“Look well after princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ, Little Man-All-Head!”\r\n\r\nWhile seated in my apartment, the day following my reception at court\r\nand the presentation of the royal library to me, whiling away the time\r\nas best I could by dipping into the early history of the Umi-Lobas, I\r\nsuddenly heard a great wheezing and whistling noise, as if some one\r\nsuffering from the asthma were approaching.\r\n\r\nBulger gave a low growl.\r\n\r\nI sprang up, and upon going to the door was not a little surprised to\r\nsee Migrô-Zaltô, coming toward me with very short hops, every one of\r\nwhich drew forth a grunt.\r\n\r\nHowever, he finally reached a seat in my apartment, and after half an\r\nhour’s rest, addressed me as follows:\r\n\r\n“I bring thee good news, Little Man-All-Head. His majesty, King Gâ-roo,\r\nhas graciously resolved to appoint thee one of his Ministers of State.\r\nPoly-dotto has informed him that your head is exactly three times larger\r\nthat the largest Umi-Lobas, and that, consequently, you must be at least\r\nthree times as wise as any of his counsellors. He is, quite naturally,\r\nunwilling that any other monarch should have the use of the vast\r\ntreasure of wisdom stored in thy head. His design is to treat thee like\r\na son, to surround thee with everything that gold can buy or cunning\r\nhands fashion, for thy comfort and amusement; in a word, so to shower\r\nhonors upon thee that thou shalt soon forget thy home and kinspeople.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of Migrô-Zaltô’s words upon me was indescribable.\r\n\r\nI felt as if my heart were about to beat its last.\r\n\r\nIt was only by the greatest effort that I could pull myself together,\r\nstammer out my thanks to his majesty, King Gâ-roo, and save myself from\r\nbetraying my utterly disconsolate condition.\r\n\r\nBehold me now a prisoner for life! For in spite of all these honeyed\r\nwords, King Gâ-roo now proceeded to double the number of guards set to\r\nwatch my movements, and thus head off any attempt at escape.\r\n\r\nI, of course, pretended not to notice this extra precaution.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I put a smiling face over my sad heart, and pretended to be\r\nperfectly contented; to have given up all thoughts of ever returning\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nI took good care to let Migrô-Zaltô know that I now intended to begin\r\nstudying the ancient history of his people.\r\n\r\nWith the princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ, too, I was all kindness and sympathy. But\r\nwhile I was thus engaged in throwing my keepers off their guard, I was\r\ndiving deep into the folk-lore of the Umi-Lobas.\r\n\r\nThe books of the royal library, so graciously bestowed upon me by King\r\nGâ-roo, stood me in good service.\r\n\r\nI determined to get at all the weaknesses of the Umi-Lobas, in order to\r\nsee if I could not discover some way to elude their vigilance.\r\n\r\nIt was all dark to me for the first few days, but at length I caught a\r\nglimmer of hope.\r\n\r\nIt came about this way:\r\n\r\nThe Umi-Lobas dread water. My own observation, as well as Poly-dotto’s\r\nwords, had directed my attention to this strange fact.\r\n\r\nProvided by nature with limbs of such extraordinary strength that they\r\ncan leap over streams, even thirty feet in width, they have a\r\nsuperstition that nature intended them to avoid touching the surface of\r\na stream.\r\n\r\nFor the first, I now observed that they had no boats of any kind, and\r\nthat their children, unlike other children, never played upon the banks\r\nof the beautiful streamlets which flowed in every direction around their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n“A boat is the thing I need!” said I to myself, every pulse beating with\r\nsuppressed excitement.\r\n\r\nBut, ah! where to get it!\r\n\r\nIt were idle to attempt to build a boat or even a raft without\r\nattracting the attention of my watchers and raising an outcry.\r\n\r\nI must abandon that idea.\r\n\r\nBy a strange fatality my bitterest enemy now came to my assistance. You\r\ndoubtless remember how that animated coil of steel spring, Megâ-Zaltô,\r\ntried to kill me by placing tiny poisoned knife-blades in my bed.\r\n\r\nWell, after that I never laid down at night that I didn’t first pull off\r\nthe cushions, drapery and coverings of my couch in search of any more of\r\nthe same kind.\r\n\r\nI never found any, for Megâ-Zaltô was still in disgrace, and forbidden,\r\nunder penalty of instant death, to approach the royal palace.\r\n\r\nBut I did find something else.\r\n\r\nIt was this:\r\n\r\nI discovered that my bedstead emptied of its cushions and clothes, was\r\nexactly the shape of a yawl boat; in fact, of so fine a model as to give\r\ninfinite pleasure to my sailor’s eye, and, most astonishing discovery of\r\nall, that it was already fitted with a staunch and shapely mast, the\r\nstaff which supported the hangings. All I needed was a couple of thin,\r\nstraight sticks for booms, and I would be able to take one of my sheets\r\nand rig a square sail in a few moments.\r\n\r\nHere again I found myself face to face with an appalling difficulty.\r\n\r\nEven admitting that I could elude the vigilance of my keepers, how was\r\nI, all alone by myself, to transport the heavy bedstead to the water’s\r\nedge, a quarter of a mile away!\r\n\r\nI was upon the point of giving up the whole scheme.\r\n\r\nThe more I turned it over in my mind the more its dangers and\r\ndifficulties increased.\r\n\r\nI paced the floor with quick and anxious step, scarcely aware of\r\nBulger’s solicitude.\r\n\r\nHe was at my heels with vain coaxings, trying to quiet me down.\r\n\r\nAt last, in blank despair, I threw myself in a chair.\r\n\r\nBulger raised himself on his hind legs and gazed inquiringly into my\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHis tongue was out.\r\n\r\nHe was suffering from the heat.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I became aware of my condition.\r\n\r\nThe perspiration was streaming down my face. Suddenly a new idea flashed\r\nthough my mind and helped out the old one.\r\n\r\nSaid I to myself:\r\n\r\n“I’ll complain to the King of the heat; I’ll tell him how accustomed I\r\nam to outdoor life and sleeping in the open air with no covering, save\r\nthe blue sky and twinkling stars; that I shall most surely pine away\r\nwith inward wasting unless I be permitted to move my bed during the\r\nmidsummer heat down by the river side, where the air is coolest and\r\npurest.”\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo listened to my request without the slightest suspicion that\r\nany idea of escaping from his domain was flitting through my mind.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he would have as soon expected to see one of his royal beds\r\nspread its drapery for wings and fly away to the mountains as to see it\r\ngo flashing down the river with one of the sheets set for a sail.\r\n\r\nSo my request was granted at once.\r\n\r\nMy bed was moved down to the river’s edge, where one tent was raised to\r\nhouse me in case of a rain storm, and another to shelter the troop of\r\nguards which always kept at a respectable distance from me, and yet near\r\nenough to hop down upon me in about three seconds.\r\n\r\nSo far all had gone well. At first my plan was to launch my boat and\r\nmake my escape in the night, but I was obliged to give this up, for I\r\ndiscovered that the guard was always doubled at night fall.\r\n\r\nEscape, if I escape at all, then must be in the broad daylight.\r\n\r\nSix of the Umi-Lobas soldiers stood sentry about my quarters from\r\nsun-rise to sun-set.\r\n\r\nThat they were armed it is needless to say.\r\n\r\nBut their tiny swords and pikes had no terror for me.\r\n\r\nWith a stout club I could have beaten them down in a few moments.\r\n\r\nTheir terrible legs and feet, however, were quite another thing.\r\n\r\nOne blow from the feet of a vigorous Umi-Loba would have laid me dead on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nI have often seen these guards amuse themselves by striking deep holes\r\nin the ground or by breaking stone slabs an inch thick with a single\r\nblow of their heels.\r\n\r\nI must choose a different mode of eluding such dangerous pursuers.\r\n\r\nThey must be drugged.\r\n\r\nBut how to accomplish it?\r\n\r\nTo offer them all food at the same moment would most surely arouse their\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\nThen again, they did not all eat together.\r\n\r\nSo too, it would be worse than folly to attempt to drug their drink.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done?\r\n\r\nAgain my heart grew sick and faint within me.\r\n\r\nI sat down to collect my scattered thoughts.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the attendant began to serve my midday repast. I glanced\r\nat the tempting dishes and sparkling wines. It was a feast fit for a\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n“Sir Pendulum-legs,” said the serving man, with a low bow, “this is the\r\nseason for O-loo-loo eggs. The first find was made to-day. The nest held\r\nsix. His majesty sends thee two and wishes thee a pleasant dream.”\r\n\r\nNow let me tell you what this strange speech all meant.\r\n\r\nThe O-loo-loo bird is about the size of a quail, and lays from six to a\r\ndozen eggs of a jet black hue. But as the bird, whose plumage is as\r\nblack as a bat’s wing, makes its nest in the wilderness, among the rank\r\ngrowth of a heather-like plant, of so dark green a foliage as to seem\r\nalmost black, the eggs are invisible to the hunter’s eye, and the nests\r\ncan only be found by posting sentinels to mark the spots where the birds\r\nalight.\r\n\r\nAs you may imagine, O-loo-loo eggs are worth their weight in gold. Nay\r\nmore, the people are forbidden to eat one.\r\n\r\nSuch is the King’s command!\r\n\r\nThey all belong to him, and the finder must straightway bear his prize\r\nto the royal palace where a rich reward awaits him.\r\n\r\nBut the most mysterious thing about them is yet to be told! Not only are\r\nthese eggs of most delicious flavor, but two of them are sufficient to\r\nthrow the eater into a deep sleep, during which the most delightful\r\ndreams steal over him! Visions of exquisite loveliness flit before his\r\neyes, and life seems so sweet and satisfactory that waking is really the\r\nkeenest pain. The cause of this strange effect was for many centuries a\r\nmystery and the ancestors of the Umi-Lobas were wont to worship the\r\nO-loo-loo bird as a sort of sacred creature. But the mystery was solved\r\nat last. It was found that these birds fed upon the seed of the poppy\r\nplant, and hence the power of their eggs to cause sleep in those\r\npartaking of them.\r\n\r\nI ate the two O-loo-loo eggs to test the matter, and in a few moments\r\nfound myself sinking into a most delicious slumber.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke I saw light where darkness had lately reigned.\r\n\r\nThe way to escape from King Gâ-roo’s guards was now clear to me. I at\r\nonce proceeded to save up my O-loo-loo eggs.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, they became more plentiful, and it was not long before I\r\nhad accumulated two dozen of them.\r\n\r\nAnd now, thought I, if I offer them to my keepers as a feast, their\r\nsuspicions will be aroused; they will refuse to partake of them, and the\r\nwhole matter will be laid before the king and I shall be shorn of the\r\nlittle liberty I have. Therefore, I must use my knowledge of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAs each man passed on his rounds I called him to me, and showing him\r\nfour of the O-loo-loo eggs, said:\r\n\r\n“I like thee; thou art my favorite, couldst thou be very close mouthed?”\r\n\r\nThe fellow’s eyes sparkled with delight, and I could see that his mouth\r\nwas watering at the sight of the dainty morsels.\r\n\r\nUpon his assuring me that he would take good care that no one should\r\nknow how kind I had been to him, I gave him four of the eggs, enough to\r\nmake him sleep like a log for three hours.\r\n\r\nHe bolted them, shells and all.\r\n\r\nI was much pleased with the working of my plan.\r\n\r\nThe next sentinel, who made his appearance a few moments after the\r\nfirst, was served in the same way. And so on with all the others. Each\r\npromised most solemnly never to reveal his good fortune to his comrades.\r\n\r\nMy plan thus far had worked splendidly.\r\n\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour I had the supreme satisfaction of seeing\r\nall six of them begin to rub their eyes, then yawn, then stretch their\r\nlittle arms up over their heads in the sleepiest manner possible. In\r\nless than half an hour they were all stretched out on the greensward,\r\nsnoring like good fellows.\r\n\r\nNow was my time to act!\r\n\r\nI sprang toward my bed to empty it of its contents and launch it on the\r\nlittle river which flowed near by, when, to my horror, I heard the\r\nprincess Hoppâ-Hoppâ calling, “Little Man All Head! Little Man All\r\nHead!”\r\n\r\nA cold chill crept over me! There she came, hopping toward me like the\r\nwind, calling out for me to come and make her laugh!\r\n\r\nWhat was I to do?\r\n\r\nStrike her down?\r\n\r\nSmother her?\r\n\r\nOh no; I could not have harmed that innocent little doll-faced being,\r\nhad it been to save myself from life-long imprisonment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, like a flash of lightning, a bright thought flitted through my\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nI have run, hopped, and stood on one foot, kicked one foot high in the\r\nair, crossed my legs, etc., to amuse the little princess, but I have\r\nnever danced for her!\r\n\r\nIf she can find it amusing enough to laugh heartily at such plain\r\nold-fashioned antics, she will surely go into convulsions when she sees\r\nme dancing a quick time jig with heels flying in the air.\r\n\r\nSo, calling out to her in my gayest manner, I said:\r\n\r\n“Come, little princess, come little Umi-Loba. Hop this way! Be quick;\r\nI’ve something very funny to show you.”\r\n\r\nShe didn’t wait for a second bidding.\r\n\r\nWith two bounds she was beside me.\r\n\r\nBidding her be seated I began to dance and she began to laugh. In half a\r\nmoment I quickened my step and she broke out into the wildest merriment.\r\n\r\n“O, do stop, Little Man All Head,” she gasped. “O, do stop, or I shall\r\ndie!” I didn’t want her to die, but I did want her to fall down into a\r\nswoon.\r\n\r\nSo now I let myself out.\r\n\r\nMy legs flashed like sunbeams dancing on the water.\r\n\r\nBulger looked on in dignified astonishment.\r\n\r\nHe failed utterly to make out what his little master meant by these\r\nfurious antics.\r\n\r\nIndeed they were furious.\r\n\r\nFaster and faster my nimble feet beat the ground. Wilder and more\r\nuncontrollable became the laughter of the little princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ.\r\nThe tears coursed down her pretty face she rocked from side to side; she\r\nbent forward and back.\r\n\r\nAdding still more speed to my movements, I kept my eyes fixed upon her.\r\n\r\nVictory!\r\n\r\nThe end came at last!\r\n\r\nShe rolled over on the greensward in a swoon.\r\n\r\n“Now or never!” I murmured to myself.\r\n\r\nIn quicker time than it takes to tell it, aided by my faithful Bulger, I\r\nemptied the bed of its contents, set my shoulder to one end of it, while\r\nBulger fastened his teeth in some fringe that hung from the other, and\r\nthen, he pulling with might and main, and I pushing with all the\r\ndesperation of a battle for freedom, the wooden structure was slowly\r\nbrought to the bank of the river.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard task for us!\r\n\r\nBut we did it.\r\n\r\nNow down the slippery bank it glided with a rush, striking the water and\r\nfloating like a duck.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Bulger and I sprang on board of the little craft.\r\n\r\nTo rig up one of the sheets as a square sail and set it on the pole\r\nwhich had held the curtains was only the work of a few seconds.\r\n\r\nA stout long-handled fan served me for a rudder.\r\n\r\nAway! Away! I was off at last!\r\n\r\nThe wind was fresh and strong, and my square sail worked to a charm.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a shrill, piping voice reached my ear.\r\n\r\n“Little Man All Head! Little Man All Head! Where art thou? Come to me!”\r\n\r\nThe shrill, far-reaching tones of her voice attracted a hundred\r\nattendants. They seemed fairly to spring up out of the ground.\r\n\r\nPell-mell, with a wild rush, the stronger ones leaping over the heads of\r\nthe less vigorous ones, they made for the river banks.\r\n\r\nAlarm bells now sounded on every side.\r\n\r\nGongs and strangely-sounding horns and rattles called the people to the\r\nspot where the little princess had been found lying half unconscious on\r\nthe greensward.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the half dozen sentinels stretched out here and there in\r\nthe deepest sleep, the scattered drapery of my couch, the bed itself\r\nmissing, all told too plainly the story of my escape.\r\n\r\nAll this time, my snug little craft was making good headway down the\r\nriver, which grew wider at every hundred feet.\r\n\r\nWith one wild outburst of shrill, angry voices, the Umi-Lobas turned to\r\npursue the fugitive.\r\n\r\nBulger whined piteously as he saw them swarming on the banks.\r\n\r\nIn another moment they began leaping from one bank to another, passing\r\nover our heads in perfect clouds.\r\n\r\nI knew full well that they would not dare to leap into my boat but I\r\nfeared that they might overwhelm us with showers of their little spears.\r\nHowever I determined to try the effect of one of my pistols on them if\r\ntheir spears annoyed me.\r\n\r\nKing Gâ-roo, beside himself with spiteful anger, now arrived upon the\r\nscene, and took command of his assembled troops and serving men.\r\n\r\nFirst he tried entreaty upon me, offering me princely sums and royal\r\nhonors if I would only turn back.\r\n\r\nBut I was deaf to his honeyed words. Whereupon he fell into a towering\r\npassion. He ordered his soldiers to recapture me dead or alive.\r\n\r\nA shower of spears now whistled through the air.\r\n\r\nMost of them fell far short of their mark, for the river had now widened\r\nso that I was at least thirty feet from the shore whereon they were\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nBut a few of these spearlets fell dangerously near me.\r\n\r\nFearing that their points might be poisoned, I determined to try the\r\neffect of a pistol shot in the air.\r\n\r\nThe loud report of the fire-arm, and the puff of smoke which followed\r\nit, filled the Umi-Lobas with the most abject fear.\r\n\r\nThey threw themselves on their faces and cried out that I was an evil\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nI could now see that King Gâ-roo had given orders to let me sail away in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThey made no further attempts to molest me, and yet it was very plain\r\nthat they were loth to part with the “little man all head,” for whom\r\ntheir King and the princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ had conceived so warm an\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nI, too, felt a wrinkle in my heart as my little boat bore Bulger and me\r\naway on the rippling waters of the beautiful river now grown so wide\r\nthat I was at least a hundred feet from the bank, and the palace of King\r\nGâ-roo began to fade away in the distance.\r\n\r\nFor several miles they followed the banks of the stream, keeping\r\nopposite me, and ever and anon sending me a good bye in a soft and\r\nplaintive voice.\r\n\r\nStraining my eyes, I could see little princess Hoppâ-Hoppâ, borne aloft\r\non the shoulders of a group of serving-men, and waving me a last adieu.\r\n\r\nThen, once more, I caught the sound of that shrill baby voice:\r\n\r\n“Good bye! Good bye! Little Man-All-Head! Hoppâ-Hoppâ says good bye\r\nforever!”\r\n\r\nAnd so I sailed away from the land of the Umi-Lobas, the land of the\r\nMan-Hoppers!\r\n\r\nIn a few days the river began to broaden out and the land of the\r\nUmi-Lobas was left far behind! The moment I caught sight of any signs of\r\nhuman beings on the river banks, I steered my staunch little boat into a\r\nbroad cove, whose sloping shores led to lofty table lands. Here, with\r\ntear-moistened eyes, I moored the little craft which had snatched me\r\nfrom a life of keen, though silent, sorrow, and followed by faithful\r\nBulger, struck out boldly for the interior. After a few weeks’\r\njourneying I entered a country which was now and then traversed by\r\ntraders. They were astonished to find me traveling all alone by myself,\r\nbut readily accepted my statement that I had become separated from a\r\ntroop of traders, and that my horse had died.\r\n\r\nI now made haste to re-cross India and gain the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, whence I took passage for home, with a joyous heart and a\r\nmemory well-stored with quaint facts and curious recollections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGER AND I SAIL AWAY FROM THE LAND OF THE UMI-LOBAS\r\n(MAN HOPPERS), IN MY BEDSTEAD YACHT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  In the streets of Constantinople, I fall in with an Armenian merchant,\r\n    who presents me with a MS., 6,000 years old. It proves to be\r\n    palimpsest. Its wonderful contents. I learn of the existence of a\r\n    boiling sea, and set sail in search of it. Three of my seamen are\r\n    swallowed by a marine monster. I rescue them. We reach Neptune’s\r\n    Caldron. Description of it and of its banks. Strange adventures\r\n    there. We set sail for home, but are overtaken by a fearful storm\r\n    which drives us on the coast of China. Bulger saves our lives. I am\r\n    received with great honor by the dignitaries of the province—am\r\n    quartered in the palace of So Too the Mandarin. Bulger incurs the\r\n    enmity of the authorities. He is accused of having an evil spirit,\r\n    and is arrested and put on trial. I defend him. He is condemned to\r\n    death. My efforts to reverse the sentence are successful. Strange\r\n    adventures in the palace of the Lord Taou-tai. Bulger and I are able\r\n    to overcome all obstacles put in our way. We are accorded permission\r\n    to set out for a seaport where we take passage for home. Our joy in\r\n    finding ourselves safe out of the hands of our enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME CROWS LIKE BOILED DINNERS.]\r\n\r\nWhile sauntering through the streets of Constantinople, one day,\r\nloitering in front of the bazars, or listening to the tales of some\r\nstory-teller on the street-corner, I fell in with an Armenian merchant.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of varied attainments, had read much, traveled much, seen\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nWe ate sweetmeats and drank coffee together for several days.\r\n\r\nHe was so delighted with my keen intellect, sharp, nipping wit, and\r\ngreat powers of imagination, that he expressed himself as being more\r\nthan paid for his journey to Constantinople, although he had not yet\r\nopened his packs.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for us to part, he proceeded to loosen the leather\r\nthongs which held down the lid of a strange looking chest, whose top and\r\nsides were covered over with curious figures in inlays of several\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nFrom one corner of this receptacle he drew forth a volumen or roll-book\r\nof antiquity.\r\n\r\nTo one end of it was attached, by a strip of parchment, a waxen seal,\r\nstamped with what seemed to have been a monarch’s signet ring. This\r\nancient and venerable book exhaled a very musty smell.\r\n\r\nThe Armenian handled it carefully, saying:\r\n\r\n“It is quite old; some 6,000 years.” Seeing astonishment depicted on my\r\ncountenance, he smiled and continued:\r\n\r\n“Yes, 6,000 years! It has only been unrolled far enough for me to\r\ndecipher the nature of its contents. It treats of the human soul, and\r\npretends to have solved its mystery completely—a problem which has\r\nbaffled the philosophers of all ages. It even goes so far as to claim\r\nthat the essence which we call “soul” may be taken out of a body and put\r\ninto a bottle; that one soul may be thrust into a man’s body to keep his\r\nown company, and that in this manner the whole world may be reformed,\r\nmade over; evil being entirely destroyed and good only remaining.\r\n\r\n“You smile, little baron, but it seems to me quite feasible. For\r\ninstance, this rare old book quite rightly assumes that if we could\r\nthrust a good soul into a body already inhabited by a bad one, that man\r\nor woman would henceforth cease to do evil, or, at least, the good soul\r\nwould continually betray its bad companion, and, altho’ the man might\r\nplan a murder, he would not fail to inform some one of his dread\r\npurpose, and thus defeat his own ends.”\r\n\r\n“Or,” continued the merchant, “take the case of a miser; by thrusting\r\nthe soul of a spendthrift into his body, his inclination to hoard money\r\nand starve his family would be forever and always opposed by an ardent\r\ndesire to waste his earnings, and the result would be that these two\r\nvices would neutralize each other; and so with a drunkard or a thief: by\r\nplacing the soul of a water-drinker in the one and of a moral man in the\r\nother, a perfect reformation could be brought about. This is a valuable\r\nbook, little baron, but I give it to you, merely exacting a promise from\r\nyou that in case I am right in my understanding of it, you will impart\r\nthe secret to the fathers of the church.”\r\n\r\nI gave the merchant my promise, and not wishing to accept so valuable a\r\npresent without making some return therefore, I drew from my finger a\r\nring containing the petrified eye of a basilisk, which, in the dark,\r\nemitted light enough to read the hour on a watch dial.\r\n\r\nHe was almost tiresome in his expression of thanks.\r\n\r\nWe separated.\r\n\r\nI laid the ancient volume away in my chest and gave no thought to it\r\nuntil some time after my return home, when, one fine day, Bulger,\r\nattracted by its very musty odor, seized it by the vellum strip holding\r\nthe seal and drew it forth from its hiding-place, then looked up at my\r\nface as much as to say:\r\n\r\n“What is it, any way, little master?”\r\n\r\nI determined to unroll the book at once.\r\n\r\nThe merchant had warned me to be most careful in so doing, lest the\r\nwhole thing fly into a thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nI therefore proceeded to prepare a wooden tablet or panel, which I\r\nsmeared with a strong glue, so that, as the parchment unwound, it should\r\nbe caught by this sticky surface and held firmly fast.\r\n\r\nThe plan succeeded admirably.\r\n\r\nAfter several hours’ close application I was overjoyed to see the volume\r\nentirely unrolled and held firmly and evenly to the surface of the\r\npanel.\r\n\r\nFancy my delight, after the glue had dried sufficiently to make an\r\nexamination of the writing, to find that this ancient volume was a\r\npalimpsest!\r\n\r\nI felt instinctively that this dissertation upon the nature of the soul\r\nwas the sick man’s dream of some poor dweller in the double darkness of\r\nignorance and superstition. So I made haste to wash away his fervid\r\noutpourings by a plentiful use of something still hotter—namely, hot\r\nwater and soap; for my studies had told me that the ink used by the\r\npeople of his time and generation contained no mordant, and was, in\r\nfact, only lamp-black and grease.\r\n\r\nI now got at the real contents of this venerable book.\r\n\r\nThe writing was dim and shadowy. I did not let that trouble me, for,\r\nskilled as I am in the chemist’s art, I lost no time in applying an acid\r\nwhich restored the writing to its old time blackness.\r\n\r\nI had some difficulty in deciphering the language in which it was\r\nwritten—the ancient Phoenician—but, with the aid of several scores of\r\ndictionaries, I finally rendered it into a modern tongue, passing it\r\nthrough the Aramaic, thence into the Greek, and, finally, into my own\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nWhen at last I had gotten over all difficulties and could read the\r\ndescriptions with that ease necessary to bring out their full sense, I\r\nwas nearly beside myself with joy.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of a voyage made by a venturesome navigator, six\r\nthousand years ago, when the earth was still in its infancy; still hot\r\nin some places; in fact, only the highest mountains and table lands had\r\ncooled off enough to be habitable.\r\n\r\nPushing off from the shores of Arabia, this bold captain had pointed his\r\nship towards the rising sun.\r\n\r\nAnd, wonder of wonders! after many awful perils and terrible privations,\r\nhe had entered waters which, to his almost unutterable amazement, grew\r\nwarmer and warmer as he sailed over them.\r\n\r\nAt first his men refused to proceed any farther, but by dint of threats,\r\npersuasion and goodly presents, the bold sailor went his way, wondering\r\nand rejoicing. After many days he entered a body of water, which, from\r\nhis descriptions, I at once recognized as the China Sea. But now all\r\nfurther advance was impossible.\r\n\r\nIn vain his oarsmen lent their aid to drive the little vessel forward.\r\n\r\nHuge waves of heated water, always from the same direction drove his\r\ncraft backward.\r\n\r\nAt last the truth of the matter dawned upon him.\r\n\r\nHe was on the outer edge of some vast boiling sea, which, rolling its\r\nhot waves ever outward, drove back his cockle shell of a bark. Making\r\nfor a lofty promontory, he clambered to its highest point, wearing thick\r\nfelt shoes and gloves to protect his feet and hands from the heated\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nA fearful and yet a sublimely beautiful sight met his gaze.\r\n\r\nFor hundreds and hundreds of miles the waters were in a state of most\r\nviolent boiling, springing and leaping into the air as if a legion of\r\ngiant demons were beneath forcing their hot breath upward from vast\r\ncavernous lurking places.\r\n\r\nUpon reading of this boiling sea, I was seized with an uncontrollable\r\ndesire to go in search of it.\r\n\r\nTrue the waters might have cooled down in all these centuries, and yet I\r\nwas confident I should find some trace of this once terrible caldron of\r\nseething waters.\r\n\r\nThe China Sea was only slightly known to navigators of my day and\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIt had often been darkly hinted at that this vast body of water was\r\nstudded with wonderful isles and filled with rare monsters.\r\n\r\nI had no time to lose.\r\n\r\nHastily penning a letter of adieu to my father and mother, I joined my\r\nship—accompanied by my ever faithful Bulger—and turned her prow towards\r\nthe rising sun.\r\n\r\nSo well were the waters of the East known to me, from my long and close\r\nstudy of the most reliable charts, that I found I could almost steer my\r\ncraft through them blindfolded.\r\n\r\nIt was not many days ere I entered this beautiful expanse of water,\r\nwhich, in the youth of the world, was filled with such marvelous\r\ncreatures swimming on it and in it.\r\n\r\nOnward, ever onward, through its dark blue waves, now mounting their\r\nfoam-crested heights, now rocking like a thing of life upon this billowy\r\nhighway, my trusty little vessel ploughed her way. Ten times a day,\r\nunder plea of wishing to cool my brow in a basin of sea water, I called\r\nout to some one of my men to let down a bucket, but only to find, to my\r\ndeep disappointment, that its temperature was no higher than is usual in\r\nthose latitudes.\r\n\r\nI began to grow low-spirited. My crew noticed my dejection, and at times\r\nmy attentive ear caught murmurs of discontent.\r\n\r\nTo restore my men to their usual good spirits, I offered a reward of a\r\nthousand ducats to the one who should first discover that the water was\r\ngrowing warmer.\r\n\r\nA thousand ducats!\r\n\r\nIt was a goodly sum, but I was growing desperate.\r\n\r\nThe large reward, however, had one good effect; it put new life into my\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAll day long buckets rattled against the ship’s side.\r\n\r\nThree of the more venturesome men hit upon a plan to earn the reward and\r\ndivide it among them.\r\n\r\nLashing themselves together, they then lowered themselves down over the\r\nside of the vessel, until their feet just touched the water. Here they\r\ndetermined to stay, so that they might be the first to announce the\r\nincrease of warmth in the water, and in this way make sure of the\r\nthousand ducats.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a fearful outcry, accompanied by the most piteous whining on\r\nthe part of Bulger, caused me to rush up on deck.\r\n\r\nA sea-monster, a third as long as our ship, had risen directly under\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMotionless with fright, they fell an easy prey to this terrible foe.\r\n\r\nOpening his vast, cavernous jaws, he swallowed the whole three at a\r\nsingle gulp!\r\n\r\nMy men were wild with grief!\r\n\r\nThey heaped mad words of reproach upon me.\r\n\r\nI had great difficulty in restoring anything like order or discipline.\r\n\r\nMy commands fell upon deaf ears.\r\n\r\nAt last I succeeded in quieting the raging, weeping crowd.\r\n\r\nKnowing from my experience with such dread inhabitants of the deep, that\r\nthis monster had only whetted his appetite by these morsels of human\r\nflesh, I directed my men to make haste and construct a straw man, using\r\nclothes of the same color as those worn by the three unfortunates.\r\n\r\nInto the bosom of this effigy I stored away a quarter quintal of\r\nipecacuanha, of prime quality, which, by good luck, I found in my stock\r\nof medicines.\r\n\r\nThe dummy was now lowered to the water’s edge, at exactly the same spot\r\nwhere the monster had made his luncheon on my three excellent seamen.\r\n\r\nWe had not long to wait.\r\n\r\nHe rose to the bait in a few moments, and, opening his huge jaws, thrust\r\nout a tongue as large and as red as a roasted ox, and gulped down the\r\nsavory morsel I had provided for him, with a rumbling gurgle which made\r\nmy blood run cold.\r\n\r\nRecovering myself, I sprang up into the shrouds and kept my eyes fixed\r\nupon this rare monster, who floated away lazily a ship’s length and then\r\ncame to a dead halt.\r\n\r\nEver and anon a quiver shot thro’ the entire length of his body.\r\n\r\nEvidently he was having no little difficulty in swallowing this last\r\nmorsel.\r\n\r\nHuge ridges formed about his neck and rolled backward till they were\r\nlost beneath the waters. A certain uneasiness now marked his movements.\r\n\r\nHe rolled from side to side, opening and shutting his jaws with a snap\r\nthat sounded like the bang of two great oaken doors.\r\n\r\nThe dainty quarter quintal of ipecacuanha was manifestly beginning to\r\ndistress him.\r\n\r\nHis rocking and rolling motion increased in violence.\r\n\r\nAt one moment his huge body turned upon its side, bent itself until head\r\nand tail met; at another it arched itself in the air until its black\r\nback spanned the waters like a bow.\r\n\r\nI now felt that it was time to act.\r\n\r\n“Stand by the starboard launch!” I called out to my men. “Avast that\r\nblubbering! All ready?”\r\n\r\n“Ay! ay!” came back from the gang.\r\n\r\n“Lower away, then!”\r\n\r\nI was not a whit too quick with my orders.\r\n\r\nThe launch had no sooner struck the water than the sea-monster—after a\r\nseries of terrible contortions, during which it almost seemed as if his\r\nhuge body would be snapped in twain—began to disgorge the varied\r\ncontents of his stomach.\r\n\r\nFirst, shower after shower of many colored fishes, of all sizes, from a\r\nhand’s length to three cubits, filled the air.\r\n\r\nAs they fell into the water, they calmly swam away, no doubt well\r\npleased to find themselves in more agreeable surroundings.\r\n\r\nThousands of shell fish, all kinds, sizes and colors, then came flying\r\nforth, rattling their claws together as they fell into the water, as if\r\nin defiance at their huge foe that had been so unceremoniously called\r\nupon to give up the results of many a long hour’s hunt.\r\n\r\nThe living was followed by the dead, for now came forth several wooden\r\nbuckets, three old blankets, numerous bits of plank, rope ends, shreds\r\nof sail, paint pots, bundles of oakum, and wads of cotton, all of which\r\nhe had picked up while following in the wake of our vessel. At last the\r\nman of straw was cast out high into the air with a deep grunt of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAfter him came number one of the lost seamen.\r\n\r\nNumbers two and three were not slow in arriving.\r\n\r\nThe launch made haste to pick them up, leaving the sick monster to\r\nrecover his health and spirits as well he might.\r\n\r\nBulger received the rescued men with the wildest manifestations of\r\ndelight, and clapping on all sail, away we bounded before a rattling\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nTo my infinite joy, the water now began to increase in warmth.\r\n\r\nHour by hour the rise in temperature, although slow, was steady.\r\n\r\n“At length, my men!” cried I to my crew, “we are on the right track. Be\r\npatient! I promise you that before the sun has quenched his fire in the\r\nwestern seas we shall cast anchor in Neptune’s Caldron!”\r\n\r\nMy predictions came true to the very letter.\r\n\r\nJust as the last rays of sunlight were gilding the foam-crested waves of\r\nthis mysterious sea, a long, low line of shore was sighted dead ahead,\r\nending in a precipitous headland.\r\n\r\nBearing away we rounded this and found ourselves at the entrance of a\r\nlarge land-blocked bay or gulf, from different points in which huge\r\ncolumns of snow-white steam floated lazily skyward, twisting themselves\r\nin most fantastic shapes ere they vanished in the purple twilight.\r\n\r\nMy men sent up a loud, long, lusty cheer, as we sailed into Neptune’s\r\nCaldron.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near shore, to my great bewilderment, for I had not dared to\r\nthink that living creatures could exist in these heated waters, I caught\r\nsight of moving things in the Caldron. Nay, there could be no doubt, for\r\nthese heated waters were as limpid as a mountain spring and the bottom\r\nplainly visible ten fathoms below.\r\n\r\nFish of all colors and sizes floated hither and thither, while myriads\r\nof crabs, lobsters and other queerly shaped crustaceans crawled about on\r\nthe snow-white sands, following their leaders in long lines, like a\r\nprocession of cardinals, over the white marble pavement of some great\r\ncity in the western world.\r\n\r\nI say “crimson lines,” for the heat of the water had clothed them all in\r\nsuits of richest red.\r\n\r\nAs I sat in the ship’s launch on my way to the shore, gazing dreamily\r\ndown into the waters, half-dazed by these marvellous sights, a shoal of\r\nfish rose near the boat and turned their beautiful tinted sides for an\r\ninstant to the cool air.\r\n\r\nTo my amazement I saw that their eyes were sightless, that the extreme\r\nheat of the waters had clouded their limpid orbs milk white and shut out\r\nthe light forever!\r\n\r\nA cold chill crept over me, for, to me, the spectacle was as uncanny as\r\nif the carp had sprung from the elder baron’s table and begun to swim\r\nabout in their native element once more.\r\n\r\nBut the list of strange things was not yet exhausted, for as I drew\r\nnearer to the beach, you may imagine my mingled wonder and amusement at\r\nseeing scores of fish with their backs planted against the sand furrows,\r\ncalmly fanning themselves with their broad, flat tails.\r\n\r\nUpon setting foot upon the shore, I was astonished to find the land, for\r\nfar as the eye could reach, covered deep with millions and millions of\r\neggs of different sizes, varying from that of a pigeon to that of an\r\nalbatross or wild goose.\r\n\r\nIn places these eggs lay in heaps far higher than my head; in others\r\nthey were ranged in long lines, like white furrows turned by some\r\ngigantic plough!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the truth dawned upon me. To these shores vast flocks of\r\nsea-birds came to lay their eggs year after year, attracted by the\r\nwarmth of the atmosphere. There they build their rude nests and fill\r\nthem with eggs and enter upon the task of hatching out their young, when\r\nsuddenly the heated waters hurled by some gale or resistless current,\r\nrises upon their resting places and spreads death where life was just\r\nbeginning, by cooking the countless thousands of eggs which fill their\r\nnests. And so on from year to year, until now I behold the work of a\r\nthousand floods, which have in turn added their contribution to this\r\nvast stock!\r\n\r\nWhile standing on the shores of this wonderland, one morning, gazing out\r\nacross the steaming surface of Neptune’s Caldron, several of my crew\r\ncame running toward me with startled mien and great outcry, all pointing\r\nskyward. I turned and looked in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\nA vast cloud, black and threatening, hung in the heavens.\r\n\r\nAs I stood watching it, it broadened and widened until it fairly\r\ndarkened the light of day.\r\n\r\nMy men were now on their knees, uttering the most piteous lamentations,\r\nfor they imagined the end of the world was at hand.\r\n\r\nI commanded them sternly to leave off their wailing and groaning, for I\r\nsaw that the great black cloud was simply an enormous flock of birds, of\r\nwhat species I could not then tell.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer they came, with the sound like the rushing of wild\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nThey covered the whole sky like an inky pall.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to me that they intended alighting upon the shore of the\r\nCaldron, and fearing lest their immense numbers, in settling down, might\r\nsmother us, I called out to my men to stand by the ship’s launch.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose.\r\n\r\nFor, as we pushed out from the shore, tens of thousands of these birds—a\r\nspecies of crow, but twice the size of those at home—began to settle\r\ndown in long rows as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\nFor the first, now I noticed that every crow held something in its\r\nclaws. I looked again, and saw that each of these birds carried an\r\nimmense mollusk, fully as large as a watchman’s club and something the\r\nsame shape. Imagine my mingled surprise and amusement upon observing\r\nthat those in the first row were now making for the water’s edge.\r\nApproaching cautiously, each crow thrust his mollusk into the shoal\r\nwaters of the Caldron and stood by, with eyes sparkling with joyful\r\nanticipation, to watch for results.\r\n\r\nHe had not long to wait.\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed to the great heat of the water, the mollusk soon began to\r\nopen its shell, first cautiously, but as the hot water poured in upon\r\nit, with great precipitation, fairly with a snap. Waiting for a moment\r\nor so until the hot water had curled the animal quite free from its\r\nshell, the fastidious birds then partook of the savory contents, gave a\r\nfew caws of grateful acknowledgement, and withdrew to make room for the\r\nnext row. This changing places, cooking of provisions and feasting\r\nlasted for half a day.\r\n\r\nBy that time the entire flock had exhausted its raw material. Then with\r\ndeafening cries and loud flapping of pinions, these feathered epicures\r\nrose into the air and disappeared as they had come.\r\n\r\nFain would I have prolonged my stay upon the shores of Neptune’s\r\nCaldron, but I observed that the steam from the waters was disagreeable\r\nto Bulger.\r\n\r\nWith speaking eyes, he implored me to hoist sail and seek some, to him\r\npleasanter land.\r\n\r\nI could not withstand that appeal.\r\n\r\nSo I made a farewell survey of the egg mounds, gazed my last at the\r\nred-shelled crustaceans and chalky-eyed fish of the Caldron and went\r\naboard of my staunch vessel.\r\n\r\nHeading now westward, I crowded sail, intending to hug the China Coast\r\npretty closely on my homeward voyage. All went well for the first few\r\ndays after leaving Neptune’s Caldron.\r\n\r\nBulger ranged the deck, playing the maddest capers.\r\n\r\nThoughts of home now began to occupy my mind.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron was growing old. I felt that I ought not to prolong my\r\nvoyage. He might be in need of my counsels.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, one day, at high noon, the skies darkened, the winds sprang\r\nup.\r\n\r\nI thought nothing of it.\r\n\r\nIt will only be a mad romp, which will serve right well to blow us along\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\nBut, oh, what a short-sighted creature is vain man, who thinks to read\r\nthe signs of the skies, the winds and the waves!\r\n\r\nThe merry whistling of the wind soon gave place to the dismal howl of\r\nthe blast.\r\n\r\nThe storm fiend was stalking abroad.\r\n\r\nThe startled waters now leaped wildly up from their beds, rolled\r\ntumultuously onward, whipped into foam and fury by ten thousand lashes\r\nof the blast, till, in their mad efforts to escape, they dashed\r\nthemselves against the very clouds.\r\n\r\nThe scene was terrible. ’Twas useless to command, for not a throat of\r\nsteel could have drowned the wild yells of the tempest.\r\n\r\nTo my horror, I discovered that we had sprung a leak.\r\n\r\nThe pitch and tar, softened by the heat of the water in Neptune’s\r\nCaldron, had bulged from the ship’s joints and allowed the calking to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nLike a sheet of card board, our rudder was now torn from its place and\r\nwhirled away on the crest of a giant billow.\r\n\r\nBehold us now at the very mercy of the storm, the plaything of wind and\r\nwave, a cockle shell fallen on the battle ground of nature’s waning\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nBulger, lashed to the rigging by my side, uttered no plaint, no cry of\r\nfear, no sound of distrust.\r\n\r\nI could see that his speaking eyes were following me about as much as to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n“I am not afraid, little master, so long as you are by me.”\r\n\r\nI could feel my heart thump out a loud “thank thee, dear, faithful,\r\nlittle friend!”\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I passed my hand caressingly over his head and neck.\r\n\r\nHis tail moved sadly, but I knew its meaning.\r\n\r\nIt meant:\r\n\r\n“Little master, I am ready to die; ay, most willing to die, if I can die\r\nwith you by my side.”\r\n\r\nIt really seemed as if his love was about to be put to a final test for\r\nthe dreadful cry of—“Breakers ahead!” was passed from man to man till it\r\nreached my ears.\r\n\r\nIt was only too true.\r\n\r\nTheir roar now broke upon my ears, faint, low but deep, terrible, half\r\nlike distant thunder or the growl of some gigantic beast of prey.\r\n\r\nIn a few brief moments we were on the reef.\r\n\r\nWith a terrible crash our staunch little vessel leaped upon the rocks\r\nand wedged herself in, tight and fast, between two jagged ledges.\r\n\r\nThe relentless sea now broke over and over us.\r\n\r\n“Oh! if the day would only break!” I murmured, “possibly we might find\r\nsome means to reach the main land.”\r\n\r\nTo stay here simply means destruction.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of the severest suffering, for every sea which broke over us\r\nseemed as if bent upon the fell purpose of tearing our limbs from their\r\nlashings—day came at last.\r\n\r\nI discovered now that we were about a quarter of a mile from the main\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWith my glass, I could distinguish great crowds of people running hither\r\nand thither on shore. But they made no effort to send us succor or to\r\nencourage us to cling to the wreck until the storm should abate.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done?\r\n\r\nWith a fearful crash, our masts now went by the board.\r\n\r\nOur ship was showing signs of breaking up.\r\n\r\nNeither threat nor reward could move any one of my men to attempt to\r\nswim ashore with a line.\r\n\r\nThe sun now burst forth in a blaze of golden light.\r\n\r\nI could feel the tears gather in my eyes as I looked about and saw the\r\nsad ravages of wind and wave.\r\n\r\nAlthough the storm had abated somewhat of its fury, there was no time to\r\nbe lost.\r\n\r\nDread creakings of the ship’s timbers warned me to leave the wreck ere I\r\nshould be crushed against the rocks.\r\n\r\nOnly disorder and confusion seemed to characterize the movements of the\r\ncrowds gathered on shore.\r\n\r\nWhile apparently aware of the terrible import of our signals of\r\ndistress, they showed no inclination to risk their lives in trying to\r\nsave ours.\r\n\r\nTurning to Bulger I cried out:\r\n\r\n“O, dearest Bulger! thou tried and true friend, companion of my sorrows\r\nand sharer of my every joy, thou alone canst save us! Thou alone canst\r\nrescue thy loving master and these poor wretched creatures from\r\nimpending death! I know thy courage; I know thy affection. In thy\r\nradiant eyes I read thy willingness to do or die!”\r\n\r\nFrom his earliest youth I had trained Bulger to be a bold and skilful\r\nswimmer. No eddy, current, undertow or whirlpool was angry or wild\r\nenough to strike any fear to his stout heart.\r\n\r\nWith ease, at my commands, he would dive two fathoms deep and bring the\r\nsmallest coin from the bottom.\r\n\r\nOur vessel might go to pieces at any moment, for she had wrenched\r\nherself loose from the rocky ledge and was pounding on the jagged,\r\nflinty edges of the reef with a wild and ungovernable fury.\r\n\r\nEvery fleeting moment became more precious than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nMaking a superhuman effort, I caught the end of a reel of twine, and,\r\nhaving fastened it to Bulger’s collar, bade him leap into the bubbling,\r\nboiling, seething, swirling, madly-rolling waters, storm-lashed, whipped\r\ninto foam, till billow broke on billow and all seemed but one mingled\r\nmass of fury, rage and fright. With a rapid succession of anxious,\r\nwhining cries followed by a series of quick, loud, sharp barks, Bulger\r\ngave me one last look; and, placing his paws on the taffrail, sprang\r\nlightly over and disappeared.\r\n\r\nMy heart stood still for a moment.\r\n\r\nBut look!\r\n\r\nHe rises!\r\n\r\nHe strikes out for the shore, now tossed like a bit of cork on the\r\narched backs of a storm-affrighted billow, now sunken out of sight into\r\nthe foam-flecked trough of the sea.\r\n\r\nLook again!\r\n\r\nHark! I can catch the faint sound of that sharp, joyous bark sent back\r\nto cheer his little master’s heart.\r\n\r\nAnd now he is gone!\r\n\r\nI see him not; but as the twine runs through my hands, I can almost feel\r\nevery throb of that dear, stout heart!\r\n\r\nSteadily he keeps at his work, for steadily and rapidly the reel spins\r\nround.\r\n\r\nCrack!\r\n\r\nThere goes our keel in twain.\r\n\r\nQuick, good Bulger; the end is near!\r\n\r\nBut look!\r\n\r\nWhat means that commotion on shore?\r\n\r\nSee the crowd, how it presses down to the very breaker’s edge!\r\n\r\nNow they fall back!\r\n\r\nHark!\r\n\r\nDid you not hear that shout?\r\n\r\nSaved! Saved!\r\n\r\nBulger has landed!\r\n\r\nThe men on shore have hold of the twine.\r\n\r\nThe reel whirls swiftly around!\r\n\r\nMy men, ashamed of their cowardice, crawl from their hiding-places and\r\nset to work with a will.\r\n\r\nAlready they have fastened a line to the end of the twine and it is\r\nmoving briskly over the rail.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt now.\r\n\r\nBulger has saved us!\r\n\r\nSpringing into the main-shrouds and shielding my mouth from the gale\r\nwith my hands, I called out to my men:\r\n\r\n“Stand by the hawser! Make fast the line! Now heave, O! Let go all!”\r\n\r\nWith an angry splash the hawser fell into the sea and was soon on its\r\nway shorewards.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the way Bulger saved the life of master, mate and twelve\r\nseamen!\r\n\r\nI was the last man to leave the ship.\r\n\r\nAs I did so, she shook herself loose, drew back, ran hard on the rocks\r\nwith such a terrific blow that she broke into pieces as if struck by\r\nlightening bolt or some gigantic hammer wielded by an unseen Thor.\r\n\r\nWith a wild cry of joy Bulger met me as I was drawn through the\r\nbreakers.\r\n\r\nI threw myself on my knees and covered him with kisses, while tears\r\nrolled hot and fast down my cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe people of the land gathered group-wise about us and watched our\r\ninterchanging of caresses in deepest silence, agitating their thumbs and\r\ntwitching the corners of their mouths.\r\n\r\n“What land is this? Where are we, good people?” I inquired, after this\r\nfirst outpouring of love and gratitude had spent its fervor.\r\n\r\n“Bold barbarians!” replied one of the nearest group, whose richer dress\r\nbespoke the man of rank and authority, “thou standest on the shores of\r\nthe mighty dominion of Kublai, Child of the Sun, Lord of the Imperial\r\nYellow Garb, Knight of all the Buttons, Man of the Sacred Countenance,\r\nSuccessor to all the Glories of his Ancestors now Guests of Heaven,\r\nSource of all Law and Equity, and Chevalier of all the Orders, and we\r\nare his wretched, miserable, unworthy, good-for-nothing slaves!”\r\n\r\nWhereupon the entire multitude performed the kowtow.\r\n\r\n“So then! I cried, most puissant, noble, and altogether delightful,\r\nSir,”—at the same time performing the kowtow with that grace which only\r\nthe genuine citizen of the world can command—“I stand upon the sacred\r\nsoil of the mighty Chinese Empire.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, bold barbarian,” answered the speaker, “in the province of Kwang\r\nTung, in the district of Yang-chiang, of which I, So Too, Mandarin of\r\nthe White Glass Button, am Imperial superintendent.” Hearing this, I\r\nbegged So Too to give me leave to speak, which granted, in a brief but\r\neloquent speech, well larded with all those savory epithets so sweet to\r\nthe ears of an official in that land, I told him of my illustrious\r\nfamily, my strange desire to scour the remotest seas and least-visited\r\nlands for marvellous things; how I had sailed in search of Neptune’s\r\nCaldron, of the strange things seen there, of my setting out on my\r\nvoyage homeward, my encounter with the storm-fiend, and last of all, my\r\nshipwreck on the shores of the boundless dominions of the Child of the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nAnd now, all that I craved from the servants of the Man of the Sacred\r\nCountenance was such aid and assistance as would enable me and my men to\r\nreach the nearest seaport where foreign ships cast anchor, so that we\r\nmight go down to the sea once more and reach our loved ones. To all this\r\nSo Too gave response with a most gracious smile, and then invited me to\r\npass beneath his roof, lay off my wet clothes, drink some warm tea, and\r\nhave his rubbers smooth the wrinkles out of my tired flesh.\r\n\r\nMy seamen were not forgotten. His retainers were ordered to look well\r\nafter their wants.\r\n\r\nJust as we were about to set out for So Too’s residence, several of his\r\nbody guards struck their gongs a furious blow.\r\n\r\nThe din was ear-splitting.\r\n\r\nWith a loud bark Bulger rushed towards me, and laying one ear against my\r\nleg closed his other with his paw.\r\n\r\nSo Too and his retainers, at seeing this to me laughable sight, looked\r\ngrave, agitated their thumbs and twitched the corners of their mouths.\r\n\r\nJust as I was about crossing So Too’s threshold, to my inexpressible\r\nchagrin I discovered that I had lost my purse containing a large sum of\r\nmoney. In a desperate hope that I might have dropped it on the sea\r\nshore, I bounded away in that direction, but I had not gone a hundred\r\npaces ere I met Bulger carrying the purse in his mouth. I had in truth\r\ndropped it while kneeling on the beach and caressing my beloved rescuer.\r\n\r\nNoting that in my eagerness to follow my gracious host, I had not missed\r\nthe lost treasure, Bulger had driven away several of So Too’s retainers,\r\nwho manifested a desire to appropriate the pouch of gold to their own\r\nuse, and picking it up in his teeth, had raced after me as fast as his\r\nburden would permit.\r\n\r\nAs we crossed So Too’s threshold, several small, woolly dogs sprang out\r\nand gathered about Bulger. They were apparently delighted to meet with\r\none of their race, so distinguished in appearance and dignified in\r\ncarriage. Fain would they have exchanged the usual canine civilities\r\nwith Bulger, but he absolutely declined to enter into any conversation\r\nwith them or to express any surprise at these extraordinary looking\r\ncousins of his, which seemed like so many animated bundles of\r\nfreshly-ginned cotton. Keeping close at my heels, he skillfully avoided\r\ntheir advances, and gave a low growl of relief when the door of the\r\nante-chamber was closed upon them.\r\n\r\nAfter a warm bath, my stiffened limbs were limbered up by the stroking,\r\npatting and rubbing of So Too’s bath assistants.\r\n\r\nI was then invited to encase my body in a rich suit of embroidered silk,\r\nand this done, was conducted into the presence of the amiable So Too,\r\nwho received me with a smile that was as persistent as it was broad.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours were now consumed in drinking tea, eating dainty little\r\nsugar cakes, and telling each other the most extravagant and shameless\r\nfibs in the shape of compliments,—compliments about everything, voice,\r\neyes, ears, chin, mouth, hands, feet, etc. Although I only reached to So\r\nToo’s shoulder, he regretted, in a piteous tone, his lack of stature and\r\npraised my tall, stately, noble, commanding height.\r\n\r\nOvercome at last by sheer exhaustion, So Too closed his eyes and\r\nappeared to have dropped off in a little nap.\r\n\r\nSeizing upon the opportunity, I raised my voice and began to urge upon\r\nhim the necessity of immediate action with regard to me and my men.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he arose, and after a series of kowtows, the same broad smile\r\nplaying around his wide mouth and small kindly black eyes—withdrew to\r\nconsult with his assistant, sub-assistant, and first and second\r\nsub-assistants.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when So Too re-entered the room.\r\n\r\nBulger and I, during his absence, had slept most soundly.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, for we were both tired to the bone.\r\n\r\nOrders were now given to illuminate the halls and apartments.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, thousands of the most brilliantly colored and quaintly\r\ndecorated lanterns shed a delightfully soft glow over everybody and\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nAgain we took our places around the superbly decorated table which held\r\nthe paraphernalia for brewing tea and the exquisitely painted cups and\r\nsaucers of egg-shell thinness, and the tea drinking and cake-eating were\r\nresumed. Again I skillfully turned the conversation to the subject of my\r\ndeparture for the nearest seaport.\r\n\r\nAgain So Too arose and backed out of the room for the purpose of holding\r\nanother consultation.\r\n\r\nBy this time my stock of patience had dwindled down considerable.\r\n\r\nEvery moment I could feel my blood grow warmer and warmer.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of half an hour or so, a retainer entered to inform me\r\nthat So Too had fallen asleep in the council-room, and that no one save\r\na Mandarin with an opaque blue, transparent blue, flowered red or plain\r\nred button could presume to awaken him, and that there was no Mandarin\r\nof so exalted a dignity within fifty miles of that spot.\r\n\r\nAt these words my blood fairly boiled over.\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet and began to pace the floor like a caged animal.\r\n\r\nComing to a halt in front of a tall lacquer cabinet loaded down with\r\ncostly porcelain cups and vases, I raised my foot, and kicking out\r\nvigorously, toppled the thing over on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe crash was terrible.\r\n\r\nI was really startled, for I was afraid I had knocked half the house\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nBut I had the satisfaction of seeing the Mandarin come rushing into the\r\nroom, followed by assistants, sub-assistants, gong-beaters,\r\nsword-bearers, head-shavers, ear-ticklers, tongue-scrapers,\r\nnail-polishers, and skin-rubbers, besides many others of his retainers,\r\nwhose offices and callings were unknown to me.\r\n\r\n“You have deliberated, now decide!” I exclaimed in a tone of voice that\r\nfor depth and volume would have done credit to the hero of a blood\r\ncurdling drama; and at the same moment I placed the sole of my foot\r\nagainst another cabinet, quite as lofty as the one I had just toppled\r\nover, and quite as richly laden with curios, vases and ivories.\r\n\r\nSo Too was now wide awake and not at all anxious to see this second\r\ncabinet share the fate of the first.\r\n\r\n“Thy foot to its place!” he called out, waving me to a seat, and placing\r\nhimself between me and the threatened cabinet. “Thy foot to its place,\r\nmy gracious benefactor.”\r\n\r\nAfter he had seen me safely seated, he continued thus:\r\n\r\n“Know, then, my gentle guest, that I, So Too, Imperial Mandarin of the\r\nwhite glass button, after mature deliberation with my most honorable\r\nCouncil, do order and decree that thou and thy servants shall be, as\r\nthou hast prayed, forthwith conducted to the city of Canton, and there\r\nbe delivered into the keeping and custody of the officers of him of the\r\nSacred Countenance, until opportunity shall present itself to procure\r\nmeans of sending thee and thy servants back to your native land!”\r\n\r\nHere I bent my body in token of my profound gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe Mandarin likewise made a low obeisance, and then continued:\r\n\r\n“I do further decree that the evil spirit which attends thee in the\r\nshape of a dog shall be at once bound with chains and cast into prison\r\nthere to await, his trial for witchcraft!”\r\n\r\nHad So Too plunged a two-edged knife into my vitals I could not have\r\nfelt a more agonizing hurt.\r\n\r\n“Bulger? My beloved—Arrested? Witchcraft? Chains; Prison?” I stammered\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“I have so decreed!” calmly replied So Too. “Oh! no! no! no! I cried, it\r\ncannot—it must not be! He is no evil spirit—no evil dwells in him. He is\r\nbut a simple, loving, intelligent dog! I crave suspension of this\r\nterrible decree! What hath he done? O beloved Bulger, is this thy reward\r\nfor saving fourteen human lives? Is this the way in which thou art to be\r\nrepaid for all thy courage, thy love, thy devotion? O, no! no! Kill me\r\nif you will, cruel stranger, thrust me into a prison cell, but spare\r\nBulger, spare him——”\r\n\r\nI could say no more.\r\n\r\nIt grew black before me. A fit of vertigo came upon me. I staggered,\r\nreeled, fell lifeless to the floor.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to my senses, So Too’s servants were busy rubbing and\r\nchafing my hands and feet and burning pungent wax beneath my nostrils.\r\nBulger, uttering the most piteous and anxious cries, was hastening from\r\none side to the other, pausing now and then for an instant to lick my\r\nhand or face. I sat upright to collect my senses; then clasping Bulger\r\nin my arms I patted, smoothed, kissed and caressed him amid a hundred\r\nsighs and groans, heart-rending enough to melt a breast of stone. Then\r\nthrowing myself on my knees in front of So Too, I implored him to be\r\nmerciful—to spare a faithful, loving being, whose heart was as free from\r\nguile as the flinty rock from tenderness; whose life had but one\r\nthought: to serve, guard, defend, save his master.\r\n\r\n“Rise, unfortunate stranger!” was So Too’s reply, in a tone of deep\r\ncommiseration, taking me by the hand and gently compelling me to be\r\nseated by his side. “List! If thou shouldst slice my body into ten\r\nthousand pieces I could not revoke this decree. Know that in this land\r\nof the Child of the Sun, a magistrate may not unsay his words. Mercy\r\nbelongs to him, who dwells in higher places. This creature which thou\r\nlovest so, hath been adjudged to be an evil spirit. It is a favorite\r\nform of theirs; for as the dog is man’s close and trusted companion,\r\nmalevolent spirits are most likely to assume that form, when desirous of\r\nobtaining admission to his house and heart in order to work his ruin.\r\nThis wild and unreasoning affection for thy dog proves only too clearly\r\nthat the evil spirit which dwells within him has already drawn the black\r\nlines of his mysterious art thrice around thy soul. Thrice three times\r\nwill complete his dread purpose. Thou wilt then be lost forever! ’Tis\r\nwell that some good spirit of the air or water hath delivered thee into\r\nthe keeping of the Child of the Sun. For now, upon the trial in the\r\nImperial Chamber of Perfect Justice, thine eyes will be opened; thou\r\nwilt be fully persuaded that an evil spirit of tremendous size and\r\nfearful power is squeezed into that small creature.”\r\n\r\n“Never!” I exclaimed with flashing eye and glowing cheek.\r\n\r\nSo Too smiled faintly and laying his hand upon my arm continued: “Soft,\r\nillustrious guest, thou forgettest that Perfect Justice dwells in the\r\nbosom of our gracious Monarch. His ministers and judges have tongues;\r\nbut they are not their own; they only utter the thought of the Imperial\r\nmind; therefore, what they decree must be right!”\r\n\r\n“And if the Court,” I inquired, with bated breath, “should decree that\r\nsome evil spirit hath taken up its abode, as thou claimest, in the body\r\nof my faithful Bulger—what—what—would be the—the—penalty?”\r\n\r\n“Death!” whispered So Too.\r\n\r\n“And is this thy boasted justice!” I cried, with tear-bedimmed eyes, “to\r\ncondemn a dumb creature to death with no voice to plead for him?”\r\n\r\n“Nay!” interposed So Too, “thou shalt speak for him, thou shalt be heard\r\nin his behalf—thou shalt be his advocate.”\r\n\r\n“For this mercy,” said I, “my heart empties its thanks at thy feet; and,\r\nif my words, my pleading prove not powerful enough to avert the fearful\r\npenalty thou hast named, the executioner shall but whet his axe on that\r\nsmall neck, for I shall lay my head beside this dearer head than\r\nshoulders ever bore! Blow out the spark that illumines those loving eyes\r\nand all this great world could not light a fire bright enough to cast\r\nthe gloom out of my life!”\r\n\r\nSo Too shook his head mournfully, but made no reply.\r\n\r\nCalling my men to me I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Go, honest souls, I cannot be one of you. Return to your homes and\r\nfiresides. An Imperial escort will conduct you to the port of Canton.\r\nThere, beneath some friendly flag you will find means to reach your\r\nnative land! Peace and good fortune go with you!”\r\n\r\nThen, turning to my first mate, I added:\r\n\r\n“Seek out my father, the elder baron, impart unto him the story of my\r\nshipwreck; the arrest of Bulger; and my firm determination to save him\r\nfrom the terrible fate now impending, or to die with him! The elder\r\nbaron knows my love for Bulger. He would deem me a degenerate son of his\r\nillustrous house, were I to abandon this faithful companion of my\r\ndangers and sufferings to so unmerited a fate. Go! Place this signet\r\nring on thy finger. Deliver it to my mother, with my most dutiful and\r\nhumble greeting. Be wise; be brave; be honest!”\r\n\r\nMy men now formed in single file, and as they passed in front of me each\r\none paused and pressed my hand to his lips.\r\n\r\nBulger, too, was ready for the leave taking. Mounted upon a chair at my\r\nside he extended his right paw to each seaman.\r\n\r\nTears streamed down their weather-beaten faces and, they invoked\r\nblessings on the head of their brave little companion who had saved them\r\nfrom a deep grave in the briny waters.\r\n\r\nScarcely were they out of my sight when a deafening beating of gongs\r\nannounced the arrival of the guard. My heart slipped from its resting\r\nplace. A cold sweat gathered in beads on my temples. It was only with\r\nthe greatest effort that I could draw breath enough to keep me from\r\nsinking lifeless to the floor.\r\n\r\nSo Too murmured a word of sympathy.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the gailors and sound of the chains, I uttered a\r\npiercing cry and threw myself on my knees with Bulger clasped tightly in\r\nmy arms. Poor, innocent beast! he was utterly unable to comprehend the\r\nactions of those about him.\r\n\r\n“He shall be well-treated!” murmured So Too. “Fear not for his safety or\r\ncomfort!”\r\n\r\nThe gailors now advanced, and stooping down, clasped the delicate\r\nmanacles—which were of polished silver, upon Bulger’s feet.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at me with eyes so speaking, so full of love and so\r\ntrusting that I could not bear their gaze. It meant: “I submit without a\r\nmurmur, for I know that thou wouldst not let any harm come to me!”\r\n\r\nThen one of the guards lifted him gently and placed him in a silk-lined\r\nhamper, slung upon two poles. The lid was quickly adjusted and fastened,\r\nand ere I could collect my senses to speak a last farewell they hurried\r\naway with their prisoner, for it was plain to be seen their hearts were\r\ndeeply moved by my woful countenance and grief-shaken voice.\r\n\r\nAt So Too’s solicitation I now went to rest.\r\n\r\nRest? Alas! how could sleep get into my tearful eyes? All night long I\r\nlay awake bemoaning the sad fate which had overtaken me. Had accusation\r\nand arrest fallen upon me, I could have borne it like a man; but that\r\nBulger’s loving heart should have been singled out to bear a blow so\r\nundeserved was almost death to me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGER, IN CHAINS, BEGGING FOR HIS LIFE. ONE OF THE\r\nLITTLE BARON’S DREADFUL DREAMS.]\r\n\r\nAs the hours dragged wearily along I thought of reversing my order\r\nsending my men away, and of attempting a rescue. I thought of schemes to\r\nbribe the gailor. I thought of demands for the interference of my\r\ngovernment. I thought of an appeal for mercy direct to the Emperor\r\nhimself. When day dawned I was utterly exhausted and sank back upon my\r\npillow with a groan. Anticipating my inability to get any rest for my\r\nthrobbing brow and fever-heated limbs, So Too was early at my chamber\r\ndoor with his attendants. Under his directions they bathed me in cooling\r\nlotions, patted, rubbed, and chafed my limbs; fanned me, stroked my\r\nwrists and temples, gave me draughts of quieting powders and gently\r\npressed my eye-lids down, until gradually I sank into a deep sleep,\r\nwhich lasted quite until high noon.\r\n\r\nI awoke with a strong heart. Now I was myself again. My sorrow had not\r\ngrown less; but, for the time being, I was master of it.\r\n\r\nSo Too met me with a broad smile. I kowtowed profoundly. He expressed\r\nthe hope that, his “tall, graceful, broad-shouldered, handsome visaged\r\nguest of knightly bearing” had slept well. “As for me,” he added, “my\r\nmiserable, little, crooked frame was full of pangs and tortures all\r\nnight long.”\r\n\r\nTo look at him it was hard to see any effects of all these “pangs and\r\ntortures.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed the very picture of good health and spirits. His broad face\r\nwas as smooth as a baby’s and his little eyes sparkled with suppressed\r\nhumor and mischief. We grew quite merry over our morning meal.\r\n\r\nI was playing a part. I determined to let him think that by degrees I\r\nwas becoming cured of my extravagant affection for Bulger.\r\n\r\nWith every cup of tea he drank his cold exterior kept melting off. I\r\nfelt that if I left him quite to himself, he would give me a clearer\r\nview of his inside nature than if I attempted to draw him out by leading\r\nquestions. I called into use all my wit and imagination. I buried him\r\nbeneath compliments and fine speeches. I told him some of my most\r\ndiverting stories. At last, I was successful. The servants were directed\r\nto withdraw. So Too now assured me in the name of all his ancestors,\r\nthat I was the most delightful guest that had ever sipped tea beneath\r\nhis roof. He entreated me to honor him by rising and placing my tall,\r\ngraceful, knightly form along side of his miserable, puny little rack of\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nI made haste to accept the invitation, protesting, however, that I was\r\nquite overcome by the honors showered upon me.\r\n\r\nHe maintained, with equal pertinacity that he was utterly unfit to\r\noccupy a seat by my side.\r\n\r\nSo we continued our war of compliments. Suddenly So Too thrust his right\r\nhand under his richly embroidered tunic and drew forth a small case of\r\ntablets, which folded upon each other in a curious way. He gave it a\r\nslight jerk and it flew open and unfolded itself. “I have been\r\nthinking,” he began, “of the approaching trial of thy dog on the charge\r\nof witchcraft.”\r\n\r\nA lump arose in my throat at these words, but I gulped it down and\r\nsimply bowed my head as a sign of my attention.\r\n\r\n“Thou art a stranger in our land,” continued So Too, “perchance thou\r\nwilt be pleased to know the things which I am about to tell thee.\r\nNowhere else in the great world can Perfect Justice be found save in the\r\ndominions of our gracious Emperor, him of the Sacred Countenance. While\r\nthy nation and the rest of the Western world knew no other law than\r\nforce or fraud, we had already received from our ancestors thousands of\r\nvolumes filled with the rules of Perfect Justice. Happy indeed should be\r\nthat criminal whose good fortune leads him to commit his crime in our\r\nfavored land. His punishment will be exactly what he deserves. Thou, as\r\nthe advocate of this fortunate prisoner, who is so dear to thee, art\r\nallowed to choose the yamun before whom he shall be tried. I, So Too,\r\nthy friend, do here set before thee the list of yamuns so thou mayst\r\nchoose thine own arbiter.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, So Too placed the unfolded tablets in my hand, and then\r\ndropped off into a gentle doze.\r\n\r\nI scanned the list with mingled awe and curiosity. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │                   THE LIST ITSELF.

There was\r\nstill one name left. I glanced at it despairingly. “Keen Chop?” I\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n“A just judge, a perfectly just judge;” remarked So Too with a slight\r\nincrease of animation, “a flower, a pearl of a judge; eats well, drinks\r\nwell, digests well; fond of the good things of life, a great lover of\r\nbeautiful vases and statues and screens and embroideries—always willing\r\nto hear both sides and—”\r\n\r\nHere So Too came to a halt and fell into such a sound slumber that he\r\nsnored loudly. I waited patiently for him to finish his nap. He resumed\r\nexactly at the point where he had left off.\r\n\r\n“Very anxious to build a larger and finer house and to fill it with rich\r\nand rare ornaments.”\r\n\r\nAgain So Too dropped off. Not to be outdone by him in apparent\r\nindifference at the matters under discussion, I likewise gave way to a\r\nfeeling of drowsiness and was soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nHow long we slept I know not; but, when we awoke my mind was perfectly\r\nclear on one point. I turned to So Too and said:\r\n\r\n“I am resolved! Keen Chop is a just judge! Let him decide Bulger’s\r\nfate!”\r\n\r\nThree days, long and anxious ones for me, went by before I was accorded\r\na hearing in the Hall of Justice. So Too made great efforts to amuse me\r\nand turn my thoughts away from the poor innocent captive. But all in\r\nvain. Those dark, lustrous eyes were always fixed upon me. Day and\r\nnight, they kept repeating the same question: “Dear little master what\r\ndoes it all mean? I know you will not desert me, but why must I be so\r\nlong separated from you?”\r\n\r\nAt last the long-wished for hour arrived. I was escorted to the Hall of\r\nJustice by a band of So Too’s retainers. A seat was assigned me in front\r\nof the platform, which the judge and his suite were to occupy. The vast\r\nchamber was crowded with clerks, officers, gong-beaters, accused and\r\naccusers; but a deep silence rested upon them all. As I walked to my\r\nseat a subdued murmur ran over the multitude, for Bulger’s case was in\r\nevery one’s mouth; and I could see that my youthful appearance excited\r\ngreat surprise.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a beating of gongs announced the arrival of the judge.\r\n\r\nKeen Chop entered the Hall of Justice with a majestic tread and solemn\r\nair, partly the effect of a pair of huge spectacles which were held\r\nastride his nose by heavy silken cords and tassels passed over his ears.\r\nHe was followed by a vast array of clerks, servants and attendants.\r\nThere were ink-bearers and pen-bearers; there were fan-bearers and\r\nbook-bearers; there were foot-rubbers to chafe his feet in case they got\r\nasleep from long sitting; there were nose-ticklers armed with long\r\nfeathers, whose office it was to arouse Keen Chop should he drop off\r\ninto too long a nap; there were eraser-bearers whose duty it was to blot\r\nout from the tablets all the judge had said when he resolved to change\r\nhis mind. “Let the vile, miserable, wretched accused be brought into the\r\naugust presence of Keen Chop, the just judge!” cried one of the Court\r\nofficers, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments’ delay, the wicker hamper which contained my\r\nfaithful Bulger, was carried into the chamber through a side entrance,\r\nset down in front of the judge and Bulger lifted gently therefrom and\r\nplaced on a table at my side. The silver manacles were still attached to\r\nhis feet. My heart stood motionless as I heard the rattling of the\r\nchains which ran from leg to leg. I had steeled myself to appear calm;\r\nbut in spite of my efforts, the tears trickled down my cheeks. Bulger\r\ngave a start as his dark, lustrous eyes fell upon me and he uttered a\r\nlong, low whine as if to ask: “What does all this mean, dear, little\r\nmaster?” And then he raised his right paw as high as the chain would\r\npermit, and held it out for me to shake—as was his custom when craving\r\nforgiveness for some mischievous act which had displeased me.\r\n\r\nI pressed the outstretched paw long and tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Doth the prisoner confess his guilt and humbly beg for mercy at our\r\nhands” inquired Keen Chop turning his huge eye glasses full upon Bulger.\r\nWhether it was the disagreeably shrill and creaking tone of the judge’s\r\nvoice or the glitter of the large glass discs set in front of his eyes,\r\nwhich displeased Bulger, I know not; certain it is he made answer for\r\nhimself with a single loud and angry bark. Keen Chop was so startled\r\nthat he dropped his smelling salts and motioned to his fan-bearers to\r\ncool his heated face.\r\n\r\n“Silence!” roared one of the gong-beaters, giving a deafening thump upon\r\nhis gong to inspire respect; and, at the same time fiercely agitating\r\nhis bristling eye-brows and mustachios.\r\n\r\n“My lord judge,” said I performing the kowtow, “I crave consent to speak\r\nfor the prisoner. He is not guilty of witchcraft. Nor doth any manner or\r\nkind of evil spirit dwell within his body. He is a true and faithful\r\nservant and companion of mine; perchance, with somewhat more than the\r\nusual intelligence of his kind. As his defender I call for the proofs of\r\nthis most unmerited accusation!”\r\n\r\nKeen Chop now fell asleep. But, after a few moments, his nose-tickler\r\nsucceeded in arousing him.\r\n\r\n“Let the proofs be read!” spake Keen Chop in slow and measured tones.\r\nOne of the clerks arose; and unfolding a huge sheet of paper, with\r\nwooden rollers fastened at the top and bottom like a window shade, began\r\nto read in a drawling, singsong voice as follows:\r\n\r\nProof First: That the prisoner did, without any command, upon reaching\r\nthe shore from the wreck, proceed to bite the twine attached to his\r\ncollar in twain; and, taking up the end in his mouth, pass by a group of\r\nimperial officers, and a group of merchants, and a group of artisans,\r\nand a group of idlers, and make for a group of sailors, at whose feet he\r\nlaid down the end of the twine.\r\n\r\nProof Second: That the prisoner did, at the sound of the official gong,\r\nunlike the animals of his race dwelling among us, manifest great\r\ndispleasure and ill-humor, rush towards his master, lay one ear against\r\nhis master’s body and close the other with his paw.\r\n\r\nProof Third: That the prisoner did, on the same day, in the presence of\r\nimperial officers, without any command, pick up a purse of gold dropped\r\nby his master and restore it to him.\r\n\r\nProof Fourth: That the prisoner did, on the same day, in the presence of\r\nimperial officers, upon crossing the threshold of the Lord High Mandarin\r\nSo Too, unlike animals of his kind, contemptuously and disdainfully\r\nreject the kindly welcome and friendly greetings given him by his\r\nExcellency’s dogs.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI confess that, as the clerk of the Court finished reading these proofs,\r\nmy heart rose slowly into my throat. They were, in good earnest, proofs\r\nof far more than the usual intelligence of animals of his race. I was\r\nstaggered by the amount of proof they had collected. While I felt that I\r\nshould have difficulty in persuading Keen Chop that all this was only\r\nthe result of careful training, aided by a special aptitude on Bulger’s\r\npart, I was very careful not to betray any nervousness or lack of\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nI called for some tea, on a plea of needing refreshment; but really to\r\ngain time to collect my thoughts and get myself together, after such a\r\nstaggering blow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Keen Chop dropped off into a calm doze.\r\n\r\nI finished my tea and sat waiting patiently for the nose-tickler to\r\narouse him.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw that Keen Chop was wide awake again, I arose with great\r\ndignity; and, placing myself beside Bulger, who was watching my every\r\nmovement and listening to my words with an almost painfully anxious\r\nexpression, which meant only too plainly: “What does it all mean, dear\r\nlittle master?” I began as follows:\r\n\r\n“My Lord Judge! Most ancient, antique and venerable Patriarch, stricken\r\nin full five score of honorable years, thy snow-white locks bespeak thy\r\nwisdom!” The fact of the matter is, Keen Chop was quite a young man, and\r\nso far as I could see had no hair at all on his face or head save a\r\nscanty pig-tail; but I knew how flattering it was to a magistrate to be\r\ncalled “old and venerable” and hence my desire to make a good impression\r\nat the very outset. “My mother’s breast knows no other child than me and\r\nI no other brother than this faithful creature whom heaven, for its own\r\ngood reasons, hath set upon four feet; but who, if the strength of love\r\ncould lift him up, would walk beside me, our two hearts on the same\r\nlevel. O, venerable judge—whose wisdom, like fair fruit red-ripened in\r\nthe Autumn season, is now so ennobled by the flight of time, thou\r\nknowest what love can do! Thou knowest full well how it can so steel the\r\nthin beak of the mother bird, that the merciless talons of the hawk have\r\nno terror for her! Thou knowest, better than this poor bit of humanity\r\nwhich now pleads before thee, that man’s spear hath not point sharp\r\nenough to drive the bear from her cub! Thou knowest how the timorous\r\nsparrow, to shield her nestlings, will face the viper’s horrid crest,\r\nforked tongue and stony eye! And what shall I say of this faithful\r\ncreature’s race? When lived there one of his kind that was known to\r\ndesert a poor and humble master, for a richer one; or to refuse\r\nforgiveness for a rash and undeserved blow? Where else can human hearts\r\ninvest their love and draw such usurer’s rates as here? We were babes\r\ntogether! The same sunbeams that danced a welcome on my awakening into\r\nlife, found him, too, just arrived. Of quicker growth, he was his\r\nbrother’s keeper. I gave him all my love, for no other playmate was\r\nthere to share it. I planted better than I knew, for on the thankful\r\nsoil of his true heart, that love of mine struck such deep and vigorous\r\nroot that it gave of its strength and power to his brain! Love hath so\r\nsharpened thought, that it hath grown wondrous strong! The spirit, thou\r\ncallest ‘evil,’ is, as the learned know, a reasoning being; and,\r\nalthough it may go upon four feet and whine, and yelp, and growl, and\r\nbark, this is but the mask it wears.\r\n\r\n“O aged judge, in the vast storehouse of whose mind experience hath\r\npiled wisdom many stories high, thou wilt ere long believe me, for I\r\nshall make it most plain to thee—that this faithful, loving animal, is\r\nnot gifted with the mysterious power of reason! True, most true, nature\r\nhath widened his vision; but not removed its boundaries.\r\n\r\n“Mark now, O learned patriarch, how easy a thing it is for truth to\r\npierce the armor falsehood wears, for gird she ne’er so tightly, there\r\nare always some joints that will not come together!\r\n\r\n“If my poor, weak mind be not strong enough to brush away the so-called\r\nproofs of this evil spirit, then let me be withered by the flame of thy\r\njust indignation! This creature loves me! Not the vigor of ten-thousand\r\nhuman hearts blent in one could yield a warmer love than his for me! And\r\nyet behold how short its vision is!\r\n\r\n“This curious fire-arm was given me by a Turkish merchant whose life I\r\nsaved in a brawl. I have so set it that a feather’s weight will\r\ndischarge it; but, first I smeared some sugar paste upon its trigger.\r\nLo! I turn it toward my breast! If this creature now hath but the\r\nfaintest glimmer of impending harm to his beloved master, he will refuse\r\nto lick away the sugar paste!”\r\n\r\nA death-like silence fell upon the assembly. I held the fire-arm out\r\ntowards Bulger. In an instant he scented the sweet odor of the paste and\r\nthrust his tongue out in several unsuccessful efforts to reach it. A\r\nsharp explosion rang through the great hall.\r\n\r\nI stooped and picked up the ball—which had flattened itself upon a steel\r\nplate hidden beneath my robe.\r\n\r\nBulger’s amazement was not so great as Keen Chop’s. He made signs for\r\nrefreshment. Tea was hurriedly served. A hundred fans wafted the\r\nsulphurous vapor away from his nostrils.\r\n\r\n“Once more, O wiser judge than ever in Western Lands, shed the radiance\r\nof human wisdom on things dark and obscure, behold how I tear away the\r\nweft of falsehood which some ingenious mind would have this august\r\ntribunal adjudge to be pure truth! Here, on this salver, I hold some\r\ntoasted bits of cocks’ combs—to this creature’s taste, the daintiest\r\nmorsel which nature and art can unite in producing!” Catching a sniff of\r\nhis favorite dish, my good Bulger began to bark and whine and strain his\r\nmanacles to their utmost in wild endeavors to reach it. I held the\r\nsalver out so as to permit him to reach a few pieces of the toothsome\r\nfood. He was now beside himself; one moment begging, coaxing, pleading;\r\nthe next, scolding, threatening, expostulating. No doubt he was very\r\nhungry, for it was hardly to be expected that the prison messes would\r\nsuit his dainty palate.\r\n\r\n“Most venerable judge!” I resumed, “as thou well knowest, evil spirits\r\nhold in great repugnance and dread all subtle and mysterious brews and\r\npoisonous compounds with which man strives to display or destroy them.\r\nLook now! I sprinkle this coveted dish, before his very eyes, with a\r\npowder so deadly and direful in its effect on life that this weak hand\r\nof mine holds power enough to change this mighty hall filled with light\r\nand life, into one vast charnel house. And again I bring the food within\r\nhis reach, covering it with a sheet of glass lest his ardor out-wit my\r\nvigilance!”\r\n\r\nBulger now fell upon the plate of glass which covered the food, with\r\nrenewed impetuosity, giving vent to sharp cries of disappointment as he\r\nvainly endeavored to lick up the tid-bits, rattling his chains as he\r\nstrove to scratch away the glass which kept him from his expected feast.\r\n\r\nCommanding him to be silent, I uncovered the dish and set it within\r\nreach of several dogs which I had caused to be tied near at hand.\r\n\r\nAt the first touch of the poisoned food they fell to the ground as if\r\nstricken by a thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n“Again, most sapient and venerable judge, let me add proof to proof that\r\nnaught of reason dwells within the mind of this faithful creature!”\r\n\r\n“I was wounded once in his sight by a treacherous slave. His dagger\r\npoint pierced my breast; but I smote him dead ere he could find my\r\nheart. Yet the danger of that moment seared the image of that poniard\r\nforever on this creature’s memory.\r\n\r\n“Bid now a retainer turn a dagger towards my breast!”\r\n\r\nIt was done!\r\n\r\nWith frantic cries and wild-starting eyes Bulger strove to leap upon my\r\nsupposed assailant.\r\n\r\n“Cover now the blade with its sheath!”\r\n\r\nIt was done!\r\n\r\nAgain my good Bulger made desperate efforts to reach the man, filling\r\nthe room with cries of rage and fear.\r\n\r\n“Cast away both sheath and blade!”\r\n\r\n’T was done!\r\n\r\nBut still my loved Bulger made maddest effort to protect his master.\r\n\r\n“Cast away the heft and blade and raise the empty sheath against my\r\nbreast!”\r\n\r\n’Twas done!\r\n\r\nStill it was all the same! No matter whether covered or uncovered point;\r\nwhether harmless heft, or still more harmless sheath, was turned towards\r\nmy breast, Bulger’s cries of mingled rage and fear, his mad attempts to\r\nbreak away from the shackles which bound foot to foot were first and\r\nlast, exactly as fierce.\r\n\r\nKeen Chop now did several things. He drank some tea. He ordered one of\r\nhis menials to tickle his ear. He removed his huge spectacles and handed\r\nthem to an attendant who proceeded to polish them. He then attempted to\r\nfall asleep. But, at a sign from me, Bulger began to bark so furiously\r\nthat he gave a sudden start as if he thought the animal was about to lay\r\nhold of his calves. Taking advantage of this, I strode up in front of\r\nKeen Chop; and fixing my gaze upon him, spake as follows:\r\n\r\n“Most ancient Magistrate, I crave your gracious consent to add another\r\nplea to my defense of this dumb creature. I would be the veriest\r\ningrate, whom any wretched outcast might, with justice, spurn and\r\nrevile, were I not to defend this devoted being with all my mind’s\r\ncunning and heart’s love!”\r\n\r\nWith these words, I sprang lightly up the steps which led to Keen Chop’s\r\nchair, and ere he could say nay, caught up his fan which he had just\r\nlaid down on the table beside him.\r\n\r\n“Now, venerable judge, for a last,—and I trust overwhelming—proof that\r\nno evil spirit dwells within that creature’s body.\r\n\r\n“Here are two fans: Thine! Mine! Thine, made sacred by the touch of thy\r\nage-palsied and time-stricken hand! Mine, a worthless trifle; if it were\r\npossible, made still more worthless by the touch of my worthless hand.\r\nIf, as this Court hath charged, an evil spirit dwells in this animal’s\r\nbody, it knows full well that power of life or death hangs on thy lips;\r\nthat thou canst pardon with a smile or slay with a frown; that thou\r\ncanst condemn to lingering torture or strike his shackles off with a\r\nnod!\r\n\r\n“Ay, more! that if it should, to thine eyes seem meet and wise, thou\r\ncanst adjudge both master and dog worthy of death and grant them no\r\ngreater boon than that their blood shall flow together after life is\r\nover, as their love was one when living!\r\n\r\n“Behold, I cast these two fans at his feet!”\r\n\r\nLoud murmurs broke out all over the vast assembly. Many rose in their\r\nseats and craned their necks to watch the result.\r\n\r\nBulger looked up at me with a puzzled air at first; but his mind was\r\nsoon made up. He picked up my fan tenderly and carefully, and with\r\nwide-opened, love-lit eyes, raised himself on his hind feet and laid it\r\nin my lap, wagging his tail the while, as much as to say: “Never fear,\r\nlittle master, I know what belongs to thee!”\r\n\r\nThen, with an outburst of snarling, barking and growling, threw himself\r\nupon Keen Chop’s fan, shook it savagely until the richly painted\r\ncovering was torn in shreds and lay scattered about; tossed it up in the\r\nair, only to leap upon it with all fours as it touched the floor; and\r\nthen, setting his stout claws in its joints wrenched them asunder as if\r\nthey were made of paper.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all!\r\n\r\nTo complete the list of indignities which he had visited upon Keen\r\nChop’s property, he now turned his back toward that grave magistrate;\r\nand by several sudden and vigorous kicks with his hind feet, sent the\r\nsticks in a shower flying so close to his head that one actually struck\r\nagainst the huge disc of glass placed in front of Keen Chop’s right eye.\r\nBut a court officer, who had fallen sound asleep, and let his head fall\r\nbackward, did not escape so luckily. Two of the largest sticks entered\r\nhis nostrils and remained sticking there like arrows in a target. The\r\nman awoke with an ear-piercing shriek. In spite of the commands of the\r\ncourt officers, that every one who laughed should be bastinadoed, there\r\nwas suppressed giggling here and there. Keen Chop himself twisted his\r\nface into the most comical grimaces in order to keep from bursting out\r\ninto a fit of laughter. As for Bulger, he was beside himself with\r\npleasure. In fact, he fairly howled with joy. Keen Chop now moved his\r\nthumb as a sign that he was about to speak, and a deep silence fell upon\r\nthe multitude.\r\n\r\nI was summoned to approach the steps of the judge’s chair. He spake as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“When thou art taller, thou wilt be stronger! When thou art older, thou\r\nwilt be wiser!\r\n\r\n“Know then, that, as the abject slave of the Child of the Sun, him of\r\nthe Sacred Countenance, Lord of all the Orders, I had intended to\r\ndismiss this charge against thy dog, cast off his manacles and set him\r\nfree. But it may not now be done!\r\n\r\n“Thy pleading hath convinced me that he doth deserve to die! A just\r\ncause needeth no other defence than words. But thou hast pleaded with\r\nhands and legs and feet! Thou hast been over-earnest! ’Tis proof, thou\r\nknewest the weakness of thy cause. Hadst thou not spoken at all and had\r\nthy dog himself but oped his mouth at the very outset, what had fallen\r\ntherefrom would have freed him from his shackles.\r\n\r\n“Now he must die!\r\n\r\n“Let him be delivered to the public executioner!” And then, with a\r\nmotion of his hand, he ordered the gongs to beat, so that it was\r\nimpossible for me to make reply. The great chamber was now the scene of\r\nthe wildest hubbub. The guards crowded around me as if they feared I\r\nmight, in my desperation, sacrifice my life in attempting to rescue\r\nBulger.\r\n\r\nPoor Bulger! He had been quickly lifted into his wicker cage and borne\r\nout of the court-room.\r\n\r\nAlthough I could feel my heart hammering on my ribs I gave no sign of\r\nthe storm of emotion that was sweeping over my inward being. I could\r\nhear those terrible words “public executioner” ringing in my ears; but\r\nmy infallible second sight caught no glimpse of that dreadful officer,\r\nand hence I felt that there was still hope. But, I moved neither hand\r\nnor foot.\r\n\r\nThe gongs ceased beating.\r\n\r\nThe throng departed from the hall of justice.\r\n\r\nThe guards, kowtowing, backed out of my presence. I stood there alone in\r\nthat vast, silent chamber.\r\n\r\nI was aroused at last from my deep reverie by the approach of a\r\nmessenger from Keen Chop. He thus addressed me:\r\n\r\n“The wretched, little, misshapen Keen Chop humbly begs the tall and\r\nstately stranger to drink tea with him in his private apartment.”\r\n\r\nMechanically I followed the judge’s servant, who lead me through long\r\nand winding corridors. Keen Chop had laid off his huge spectacles and\r\nreceived me most graciously.\r\n\r\nAll the servants were dismissed. We sipped our tea in silence for a\r\nwhile. At length, rising and stepping behind a screen, he returned,\r\nbearing a huge volume.\r\n\r\nIt was the record of Bulger’s trial. He desired me to examine it while\r\nhe refreshed himself after his long sitting on the judge’s bench with a\r\nshort nap.\r\n\r\nI turned the leaves of the record over slowly. Not only were my words\r\nset down with the most perfect accuracy, but correct drawings of the\r\nvarious scenes filled the broad margins of the record.\r\n\r\nOn the last page I noticed that a blank space had been left between the\r\nwords “must” and “die” and “him” and “be delivered.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis miraculous!” exclaimed Keen Chop, starting up and rubbing his\r\neyes. “What a wonderful creature is thy dog! As I slept I dreamt that he\r\noped his mouth and what fell therefrom convinced me of his innocence.”\r\n\r\n“Let him be brought into your august presence, O just judge!” I replied.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Bulger’s wicker house was deposited on the floor and he\r\nwas lifted gently out of it. I could only with the greatest exertion\r\nkeep back the tears as his large, speaking eyes were turned full upon me\r\nas if to ask: “When will all this mystery come to an end, little\r\nmaster?” I stroked his head with a loving hand to assure him that all\r\nwas right.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the attendants out of the apartment than, taking the\r\npurse of gold which Bulger had picked up on the beach and restored to\r\nme, I placed it in his mouth and made a sign for him to carry it to Keen\r\nChop, who had now resumed his huge spectacles, and sat poring over the\r\npages of the record of Bulger’s trial.\r\n\r\nBulger did not wait for a second bidding.\r\n\r\nMaking straight for Keen Chop, he raised himself on his hind feet and\r\ndropped the purse in that dignitary’s lap.\r\n\r\n“’Tis wonderful! ’Tis very wonderful!” cried Keen Chop, testing the\r\nweight of the purse, with a pleased expression of countenance, first in\r\none hand and then in the other. “Thy speech was silvern, but his silence\r\nis golden! ’Twere a crime to part two such faithful hearts. Go in\r\npeace!”\r\n\r\n“But the record of the trial?” I asked. Keen Chop spoke not, but turning\r\nto the last page, he laid his finger on the place where the blank spaces\r\nhad been left.\r\n\r\nThey were now both filled.\r\n\r\nThe word “not” had been written in each of them.\r\n\r\nThe guards were now summoned, and in a few moments the shackles were\r\nloosened from Bulger’s feet. Upon finding himself free once more, he\r\nleapt into my lap with a wild cry of joy, and covered my hands and face\r\nwith caresses.\r\n\r\nI could not keep the tears back. Clasping the faithful animal\r\nconvulsively in my arms, I wept like a child.\r\n\r\nBut a cloud came over our joy; for Keen Chop, upon my request for a safe\r\nconduct to the nearest seaport, informed me that he was powerless to\r\ngrant my request; that I must apply to Slim Lim, the Taou-tai, or\r\nImperial Governor of the province, Lord of the Peacock Feather, Knight\r\nof the Plain Red Button, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n“’Tis well!” I exclaimed. “Deign to send one of thy servants to conduct\r\nme into the presence of his honor the Taou-tai! I pine to set foot once\r\nmore on my native strand. I long to put an end to the sorrowful anxiety\r\nof my parents.”\r\n\r\nKeen Chop shook his head and smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n“Know, O honored guest,” said he, “that no one may approach the\r\nTaou-tai, Lord of the Peacock Feather, unless in answer to most humble\r\npetition of twenty pages length, his high and mighty Lordship deign to\r\naccord an audience! To attempt to do otherwise might mean death at the\r\nhands of the guards; but would most surely mean imprisonment in the\r\ndeepest dungeon of the imperial fortress.”\r\n\r\n“So be it!” I replied. “Come death, come imprisonment, I stand this day\r\nin the presence of Slim Lim the Taou-tai, Knight of the Plain Red\r\nButton, and Lord of the Peacock Feather!”\r\n\r\nKeen Chop groaned loud and deep. But seeing that I was resolved to set\r\nout at once for the governor’s palace, he sent one of his attendants to\r\nconduct me to the gate, instructing him, in case the guards raised their\r\nswords to slay me, to cry out in a loud voice that I was a harmless\r\nlunatic and had escaped from my keepers.\r\n\r\nTo end all opposition I consented to this.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Keen Chop bade me an affectionate adieu, and, followed by my\r\nfaithful Bulger, I turned my steps toward the palace of the Taou-tai.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, chaos reigned within my mind.\r\n\r\nIn as many seconds, twenty different plans of action occupied my\r\nthoughts. How shall Bulger and I overcome the opposition of armed\r\nguards? It will be madness to provoke them to use their weapons upon us!\r\n\r\nIf I am fated to stand in the presence of the Lord Taou-tai, it must be\r\naccomplished by ruse and stratagem.\r\n\r\nLuckily for me, the shades of night now began to fall, for, although the\r\ngateway and corridors of the governor’s palace might be illumined by ten\r\nthousand lanterns—as in truth I found them to be, when I reached\r\nthem—yet the light they shed was soft and uncertain.\r\n\r\nCounting upon the almost lightning celerity of my movements and the\r\nutterly noiselessness of my footsteps, I succeeded quite easily in\r\nflitting by the group of sentries who were stationed at the outer gate.\r\n\r\nDelighted with my good fortune, I sprang lightly up the steps of the\r\nportico, and, closely followed by Bulger, strode into the main corridor\r\nwith dignified mien and stately air.\r\n\r\nEight towering fellows, armed with savage-looking pikes—for one of whom\r\nit would have been no more trouble to spit me and toss me out of the\r\nwindow, than for a boy to impale a frog on the end of his pointed stick\r\nand toss it on dry land—now blocked my advance.\r\n\r\nSo noiseless had been my step that I had approached within a few feet of\r\nthem before they became aware of my presence. Had I dropped from the\r\nclouds, their astonishment could not have been greater and more\r\nludicrous to behold.\r\n\r\nThey clutched each other by the arm, leveled their index fingers at me,\r\nand whispered in a hoarse voice, as one man:\r\n\r\n“A little devil!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, my good men,” I replied, with a most gracious smile, “not a little\r\ndevil, but a soldier like yourselves; one who has fought ’neath many\r\nskies, knows what a good sword is, what good wine is, would rather fight\r\nthan run, can tell a good story, and loves war as a hunter loves the\r\nchase!”\r\n\r\nThe eight men looked at each other, tapped their foreheads\r\nsignificantly, and then fixed their gaze upon me as if they were in\r\ndoubt whether my next move would be to jump down their throats, vanish\r\ninto thin air, or expand into an awful ogre, and gulp them all down\r\nwithout pepper or salt.\r\n\r\n“Come, comrades,” I called out in a careless tone, “lay aside your\r\npikes, and I’ll show you something that I picked up on a battle-field in\r\nthe war against the Algerines, something so curious, that if you had not\r\nslept a wink for three months and a day you would still be willing to\r\nkeep awake and examine it.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, I drew my musical snuff box out of my pocket, and tapping\r\nits lid mysteriously, tiptoed my way towards the outside entrance of the\r\ncorridor, and beckoned them to follow me.\r\n\r\nThey did so, with the most comical expression of half-wonder and half\r\ncuriosity depicted on their faces. But first they quietly set their\r\ngrim-looking pikes in the rack against the wall.\r\n\r\nMotioning them to lay their heads together and bend down so that they\r\ncould see and hear—for I reached about up to their girdles. I touched\r\nthe spring of the snuff box and it began to play.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to give you any idea of the delight which shone\r\nupon their great, round smooth faces.\r\n\r\nTheir mouths fell open.\r\n\r\nTheir fingers twitched nervously, as if they longed to touch the little\r\nwonder, and yet dared not. I felt now that the moment had arrived for me\r\nto act.\r\n\r\nWinding up the snuff box to its utmost limit, I thrust it into the hands\r\nof one of the guards, who seemed beside himself with joy, and showed him\r\nhow to touch the secret spring.\r\n\r\nAs the music began again, they closed up their group so tightly that\r\neven if I had wished to remain one of the circle it would have been an\r\nimpossibility. To my infinite satisfaction they now seemed to dismiss me\r\nmost unceremoniously from their society.\r\n\r\nMore quickly than it takes to tell it, I drew a ball of strong twine\r\nfrom my pocket, and fastening the ends of their cues securely together,\r\nI retreated to the outside entrance of the palace and placed the other\r\nend of the string between Bulger’s teeth, with a motion that meant:\r\n\r\n“Stand fast and pull hard!”\r\n\r\nIn another instant I had passed the group of guards and was making for\r\nthe door of the audience chamber.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the enormity of their negligence dawns upon them.\r\n\r\nThey look up.\r\n\r\nThey see me already at the end of the corridor!\r\n\r\nThey drop the enchanted box which has decoyed them from the path of\r\nduty!\r\n\r\nThey start towards their pikes!\r\n\r\nSome mysterious force holds them chained to the floor!\r\n\r\nBulger is doing splendid work!\r\n\r\nMy hand is on the door of the audience chamber!\r\n\r\nSmitten with a superstitious dread of some unseen power, the guards\r\nstand rooted to the spot.\r\n\r\nA low whistle tells Bulger that his task is complete.\r\n\r\nHe flashes through the corridor like a spirit.\r\n\r\nWe enter the vestibule of the audience chamber, we pass through an outer\r\napartment, we stand in the presence of Slim Lim, Lord of the Peacock\r\nFeather!\r\n\r\nSlim Lim was at home.\r\n\r\nHe was seated in the centre of the spacious apartment, sipping a cup of\r\nvery fragrant tea, the aroma of which was so fascinating that I paused\r\nand inhaled it with all the gusto of a fine taster.\r\n\r\nTwo ladies, clad in robes of great beauty and richness, were busy\r\nbrewing tea and spreading before the Lord Taou-tai an infinite number of\r\ndelicate viands and toothsome tid-bits.\r\n\r\nBut he ate nothing.\r\n\r\nHe was evidently somewhat disturbed by my sudden appearance, and I could\r\nsee that one thought, to the exclusion of all others, was occupying his\r\nmind. It was: “How did this stranger pass the guards? True he is small;\r\nbut if he can calmly walk into my apartment why may not an evil-disposed\r\nperson do likewise?”\r\n\r\nDetermined to convince Slim Lim and the ladies of his household of my\r\nnoble lineage and refined manners, I kowtowed with all the grace of a\r\nveteran courtier, and began the enumeration of their various virtues,\r\nexcellencies, and charms of body and mind. When I had reached number one\r\nhundred and seventeen, the victory was complete.\r\n\r\nThey smiled.\r\n\r\nBut Slim Lim remained obdurate. He gazed into vacancy for several\r\nmoments and then pretended to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nI recited the purpose of my visit and waited patiently for the Lord of\r\nthe Peacock Feather to deign to reply.\r\n\r\nHe did so at last; but without opening his eyes, speaking as if half in\r\na dream:\r\n\r\n“Barbarian, son of a barbarian, grandson of a barbarian,\r\ngreat-grandson of a barbarian, great-great-grandson of a barbarian,\r\ngreat-great-great-grandson of a barbarian——”\r\n\r\nWell knowing that this was a mere ruse to waste the night in words, I\r\nresolved to put an end to it at once.\r\n\r\nI sat down and interrupted Slim Lim’s long and dreary list by pretending\r\nto snore with that regularity which proves the accomplished sleeper.\r\n\r\nHe came to a sudden halt.\r\n\r\nA deep silence now settled upon the scene, only broken by the nervous\r\nrattle of the ladies’ fans.\r\n\r\nSlim Lim now began to realize that he had no ordinary mortal before him.\r\n\r\nFor the first time he looked me squarely in the face.\r\n\r\nThe ladies grew alarmed at the dark cloud gathering on the brow of their\r\nliege lord, and withdrew to the other end of the room.\r\n\r\nThe Taou-tai was now wide awake.\r\n\r\nSo was I!\r\n\r\n“Bold, thoughtless, and ill-counselled stranger,” he cried out, “by the\r\ndecree of the Child of the Sun, him of the Sacred Countenance, it is not\r\nlawful to punish a rash petitioner like thee, provided his prayer be one\r\nthat may be granted. But what thou askest is impossible, for at this\r\nhour there is neither paper, ink nor brush within the palace! Thou must\r\nsuffer for thy rash conduct. Thou hast been cunning enough to pass the\r\nguards in coming hither: but already a score of pikes are leveled at thy\r\nbreast. Escape is impossible. Prepare for death or imprisonment in\r\ndungeon cell which knows neither light nor warmth!”\r\n\r\nTo speak the truth, my legs bent beneath the weight of my body as these\r\ncruel words made clear to me the danger I was in.\r\n\r\nI could see that tears had gathered in the eyes of the two gracious\r\nladies, standing near me.\r\n\r\n“Paper—ink—brush!” I murmured, half dazed, “brush—paper—ink—or death!”\r\n\r\n“It must not be!” I glanced about me. I closed my eyes. I fixed my gaze\r\non Bulger, but all in vain—no help came to me.\r\n\r\nA cold perspiration stood on my brow.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a huge parrot which was perched on a bamboo cage at one end of\r\nthe room, uttered a harsh cry.\r\n\r\nQuicker than it takes to tell it, I called Bulger to my side and set him\r\nteasing the bird.\r\n\r\nHe was not averse to enter upon the sport.\r\n\r\nWhen it was well under way, I approached the bird from the rear, and as\r\nhe bent forward to repel Bulger’s familiarity, I deftly laid hold of one\r\nof his longest tail-feathers and pulled it out. An ear-splitting yell\r\nwent up, and the two ladies threw themselves towards their pet with a\r\nthousand tearful expressions of pity and endearment.\r\n\r\nI now turned my attentions to Slim Lim.\r\n\r\nDrawing a pair of tiny shears from my pocket, I caught at the end of his\r\ncue and snipped off an inch of it.\r\n\r\nMy audacity struck him dumb. He could only stare at me with wide opened\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nI set to work now in good earnest.\r\n\r\nDrawing some silk threads from my sleeve, I fitted the hair into the\r\nquill with such nimble, cunning fingers that Slim Lim looked on quite\r\nawe-struck.\r\n\r\n“The brush is ready, Lord of the Peacock Feather!” I cried, laying it\r\ndown in front of him. “And the paper too!” I continued, drawing out a\r\npaper mat from under a curio and turning up the white underside.\r\n\r\nHe followed my movements as a child would those of a necromancer.\r\n\r\nInk now was only lacking!\r\n\r\nWith one of my most winning smiles I drew near the ladies, and thus\r\naddressed them:\r\n\r\n“Fasten forever the images of your beautiful faces upon the pages of my\r\nmemory by lending me the jar of ebon pigment with which you add lustre\r\nto those matchless arches that shade your eyes!”\r\n\r\nThey returned my smile with entrancing grace and sweetness. But what was\r\nmore pleasing still, they granted my request.\r\n\r\nHalting for a moment at the cage of my friend, the parrot, who ruffled\r\nhis feathers and eyed me most suspiciously, to moisten the pigment from\r\nhis drinking vessel, I then strode with an air of triumph back to the\r\ntable where Slim Lim sat nervously fanning himself, and said:\r\n\r\n“Most noble Lord of the Peacock Feather, thy dull-witted, misshapen and\r\nworthless slave hath prepared brush, ink and paper; deign to set thy\r\nmost honorable sign-manual to this paper so that he may withdraw his\r\npoor, miserable body and limbs from beneath thy sacred roof!”\r\n\r\nSo saying, I held out the brush to Slim Lim.\r\n\r\nWith trembling hand he took hold of it and rapidly traced the mysterious\r\ncharacters which were destined to open every gate and unbar every door\r\nuntil I stood once more on shipboard bound for my native land.\r\n\r\nFolding up the precious document, I thrust it into my sailor’s pouch.\r\nBut while I was flushed with victory, Slim Lim showed only too plainly\r\nthat he was nearly beside himself with chagrin and vexation.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of his household approached him with most profound obeisances\r\nand with loud and deep-drawn sighs at every step. But Slim Lim repulsed\r\nthem in the rudest manner. He would have none of their sympathy, none of\r\ntheir pity or tender offices.\r\n\r\nThey redoubled their efforts; their sighs became more tender and louder.\r\n\r\nIt was all in vain.\r\n\r\nSlim Lim was determined not to be propitiated.\r\n\r\nTurning to me, he cried out:\r\n\r\n“Let the barbarian, the son of a barbarian, the grandson of a barbarian,\r\nthe great-grandson of a barbarian, the great-great-grandson of a\r\nbarbarian, the great-great-great-grandson of a barbarian, the\r\ngreat-great-great-great-grandson of a barbarian inscribe his wretched,\r\nworthless, mean, common, ordinary, insignificant and despicable name\r\nupon a sheet of paper ere he goes forth, so that I and my children, and\r\nmy children’s children, and my children’s children’s children, and my\r\nchildren’s children’s children’s children may speak it with contempt!”\r\n\r\nAnd then, in order to prove to me that he considered himself disgraced\r\nto sit in my presence, he threw himself full length upon the floor.\r\n\r\nBulger got it into his head that this strange proceeding was in some way\r\na menace to me, for he walked cautiously around Slim Lim, sniffing at\r\nhim and growling in a threatening way, as if to say: “Don’t play any\r\ntricks on my little master, or it will go hard with you!”\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Slim Lim’s household were nearly crazed with grief and\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nI assured them of my protection, but this only seemed to increase their\r\nsolicitation.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, however, I was not half so calm as I appeared to be.\r\n\r\nCruel fate seemed to have woven her meshes about me once again.\r\n\r\nSlim Lim, with deep cunning, had set another task for me which seemed so\r\nimpossible of performance that he doubtless was already congratulating\r\nhimself and applauding his own skilfully devised plan for holding me\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nHe had demanded that I should “write my name” before going forth; he had\r\nbeen most careful to use the word “write” so that I should not be\r\npermitted to use a brush after the manner of his people; but must have\r\nrecourse to a pen after the manner of my own.\r\n\r\nFeeling pretty confident in his mind that I would not have a pen in my\r\npossession, he had ground for flattering himself that I was still in his\r\npower.\r\n\r\nBulger caught a glimpse of the shadow that had settled upon my face, and\r\nwhined nervously.\r\n\r\nA thought struck me!\r\n\r\nA quill will save me!\r\n\r\nI looked towards the parrot.\r\n\r\nAh! deep-laid plan to rob me of my liberty!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGER HOLDING SLIM LIM DOWN, WHILE I CUT A PEN ON HIS\r\nLITTLE FINGER NAIL.]\r\n\r\nThe bird had been removed from the room.\r\n\r\nThe brush I had fashioned—the pigment, too, were gone!\r\n\r\nI could feel my knees grow weak.\r\n\r\nMy breath came short and quick.\r\n\r\nA cold chill crept over me.\r\n\r\nThere lay the Lord of the Peacock Feather flat on his back, but as I\r\nturned my glance quickly upon him, I was sure that one of his eyes was\r\nhalf open and fixed upon me, while a faint ripple of a smile played in\r\nthe corners of his mouth most maliciously.\r\n\r\n“Ah! man of guile!” thought I, “thou shalt not triumph, for I am about\r\nto shatter this last one of thy fetters, which thou dost think is\r\nalready so firmly riveted upon my wrists. Thou art wise and thou art\r\nsubtle, but not so wise and not so subtle as the little baron who stands\r\nbeside thee!”\r\n\r\n“To me, Bulger!” I cried.\r\n\r\nWith a single bound he reached my side.\r\n\r\n“Take thy place there!” I continued, pointing to Slim Lim’s breast, “and\r\nif my enemy moves but the poor space of a narrow inch, do thy duty!”\r\n\r\nBulger sprang lightly upon Slim Lim’s breast, and with a low growl gave\r\nhim to understand that there must be no trifling.\r\n\r\nThen my turn came to act.\r\n\r\nWhipping my pocket-knife out, I laid hold of Slim Lim’s hand, and in\r\nless than a minute’s time I cut a fine pen, with an excellent nib, on\r\nthe end of the long nail of his little finger.\r\n\r\nBulger looked on very much interested, giving a low growl every time\r\nSlim Lim showed the slightest indication of resenting the treatment to\r\nwhich I was subjecting him.\r\n\r\nMy ink?\r\n\r\nThat was a simple matter. Pricking my thumb with the point of my knife,\r\nI let a few drops of the crimson fluid collect on the palm of my hand.\r\nThen, reaching out for one of the paper mats, I dipped the pen which now\r\ngraced the little finger of the Lord of the Peacock Feather, and set my\r\nsignature on the uncolored side of the mat in a neat, round hand.\r\n\r\nBidding Bulger descend from his post of honor, I now held out my hand to\r\nhis excellency, the Taou-tai, with these words:\r\n\r\n“Rise, Sir Knight of the Plain Red Button; be generous as thou art\r\nnoble; I have triumphed! Forgive my audacity. In my place, thou wouldst\r\nhave done likewise. Let thy enemy become thy friend. In birth, noble; in\r\nletters, learned; in arts, skilled; he is more worthy of thy friendship\r\nthan deserving of thy enmity!”\r\n\r\nSlim Lim seized my hand, and sprang to his feet with a good-humored\r\nsmile on his broad face.\r\n\r\n“By the sacred countenance of the Child of the Sun, Lord of all the\r\nOrders, thou art very clever for thy size!” he exclaimed, as he\r\nconducted me to a seat.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the Taou-tai’s household, who had retreated\r\nhorror-stricken to their apartments, were now summoned to appear.\r\n\r\nTea was brewed and the Lord of the Peacock Feather insisted upon serving\r\nme with his own hands.\r\n\r\nI was almost crazed with joy at thought of setting out for home under\r\nsuch happy auspices.\r\n\r\nBulger made friends with Slim Lim, and everybody forgave everybody.\r\n\r\nHis excellency, the Taou-tai, prevailed upon me to pass the night under\r\nhis roof, assuring me that in the morning I should have a special\r\nescort, his own porte-chaise, and hampers packed in his own kitchen for\r\nmy refreshment while on my journey to the seaport.\r\n\r\nUntil a late hour Slim Lim, the ladies of his household, Bulger and I\r\ngave ourselves up to feasting and merrymaking. In the morning I took my\r\nleave of the Taou-tai and his household in the happiest frame of mind.\r\n\r\nA short week found me on board of a good staunch vessel bound for home\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs the sails filled and we sped out of the harbor, I drew Bulger to my\r\nbreast and the tears fell thick and fast. He licked my hands and face,\r\nand fixed his large, lustrous eyes full upon me.\r\n\r\nHe could not, and I would not, speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  How I grew weary of travel and resolved to settle down for a long\r\n    rest. A quiet life however soon tires me, and I desire to set out\r\n    again. Bulger’s opposition. How I deceived him. We take our\r\n    departure. Encounter a terrible storm.

Our unspeakable joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GOOD MOTHER ROUNDBODY AMUSING HER CHILDREN.]\r\n\r\nAt this period of my life I had firmly resolved to settle down and enjoy\r\na good, long rest.\r\n\r\nBulger and I both needed it. We were tired of strange sights, strange\r\nlands and strange people.\r\n\r\n“Why should we not,” thought I, “enjoy our world-wide fame?”\r\n\r\nFrom the very ends of the earth, visitors flocked in thousands to my\r\nHouse Wonderful to see my treasures, my extraordinary curiosities, and\r\nabove all, my remarkable dog, Bulger, the sole companion of my strange\r\nand eventful life, my guide, my friend, my counsellor, my all. Scarcely,\r\nhowever, were the valleys green again after a long and bitterly cold\r\nwinter—so cold in fact that I drank nothing but iced tea for full three\r\nmonths, as it was utterly impossible to carry the pot from the stove to\r\nthe table quickly enough to prevent its freezing,—than my thoughts\r\nturned to the pleasures and dangers of a roving life, and I longed to be\r\nup and off again in quest of new adventures.\r\n\r\nAs I roused myself from my reverie I found Bulger sitting at my feet\r\nwith his kind, lustrous eyes fixed full upon my face. He had read my\r\nthoughts as correctly and easily as I might the words of a child’s\r\nprimer, and as he saw that I was wide awake and in full possession of my\r\nfaculties, he seized hold of my sleeve and whined most piteously.\r\n\r\nDear, faithful animal! Oh, that I had heeded thy remonstrance!\r\n\r\nBut no, it was not to be.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to fret and worry good Bulger, I now resolved to make use of a\r\nfaculty which had no place in his nature—namely hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in my presence I pretended to be perfectly happy and\r\ncontented, going about laughing, singing and dancing; but the very\r\nmoment he had quitted the room I set to work making ready for another\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAt last all was ready.\r\n\r\nWhen Bulger entered the house and set eyes upon boxes and packages, he\r\nlifted his head and gave one long, dismal howl of entreaty; but seeing\r\nthat my purpose was fixed, like a true and faithful servitor, he bounded\r\nto my side and licked my outstretched hand, as much as to say: “Thy road\r\nis my road, thy fate is my fate!”\r\n\r\nIn a few hours we were on our way to the sea-board.\r\n\r\nMy heart was light, my spirits buoyant and gay.\r\n\r\n“What is life?” I cried. “Am I a worm to vegetate in mold and darkness?\r\nNay! I am a creature of intelligence, of mind, of soul; the air, the\r\nsunlight, the boundless universe, are mine; I will enjoy them.”\r\n\r\nLuckily I had not long to wait in the seaport, for a good, staunch\r\nvessel was nearly loaded.\r\n\r\nLearning that she was bound for the Southern ocean, I at once ordered my\r\neffects to be set on board, and before the new moon had lost its\r\ncrescent I was on the high seas with my faithful Bulger by my side and a\r\nbounding heart beating joyful music in my breast.\r\n\r\nFor a while all went well.\r\n\r\nBulger seemed to have gotten over his strange presentiment of evil and\r\nromped about the deck with all his old-time love of mirth and jollity.\r\nBut upon me, however, after our good vessel was a few days out, there\r\ncame a strange feeling never experienced before.\r\n\r\nIn my dreams, light and darkness alternately oppressed me; the one more\r\ndazzling than the electric flash, the other deeper than earthly night.\r\n\r\nOur seventh day out, at high noon, suddenly it seemed as if some mighty\r\nhand had drawn a vast and impenetrable curtain of inky blackness over\r\nthe entire sky. It almost appeared as if some terrible demon of the\r\nskies had suddenly blown out the very sun itself.\r\n\r\nBulger, with one bound, gained my side, and, fastening his teeth in my\r\nsash, moaned piteously, as was his custom when he thought my life in\r\ndanger. I stooped and stroked his head. The palm of my hand felt the hot\r\ntears that were streaming from his eyes. Just then the vessel gave a\r\nlurch, and Bulger’s weight tore his teeth from their hold in my sash,\r\nand in an instant he was separated from me. I heard his supplicating\r\nbark in a distant part of the ship.\r\n\r\n“Bulger! Bulger!” I cried, “here! here! this way, to me, to me!” and in\r\nmy desperation at thought of losing my loved companion, I darted in the\r\ndirection of the barking, regardless of the black night which enveloped\r\nus, and stumbling over some object fell headlong on the deck.\r\n\r\nMy fall stunned me.\r\n\r\nI rose upon my elbow and passed my hand over my eyes like a person just\r\nwaking from a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nSulphurous flames now darted from the four quarters of the heavens, and\r\ncrash upon crash of deafening thunder rattled and pealed over our heads.\r\n\r\nA terrific blast of wind caught up our ship like a cockle shell and\r\nhurled it along through the seething, bubbling, maddened waters at such\r\na fearful rate that every instant it seemed as if she must go to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nI know not how long we were driven along at this furious speed, for I\r\nwas half dazed by the roar of the warring elements and blinded by the\r\ncontinuous flashing of the lightning. To my horror, the sound of\r\nterrible blows, dull but awful in their energy, now fell upon my ears.\r\n\r\nWe had struck upon the rocks, and our ship was pounding out her own life\r\nbeneath my very feet.\r\n\r\nInstinctively I called upon my faithful Bulger.\r\n\r\nBut not the voice of brazen throat and lungs could overcome the din of\r\nthat tempest.\r\n\r\nThe intense darkness was now dissipated by showers of meteoric fire,\r\nwhich fell like ten times ten thousand bursting rockets as far as the\r\neye could reach. And then deep rifts broke in the inky mantle of the\r\nheavens and showers of hail stones, each as large as a goose egg,\r\nrattled with the fury of musketry upon the deck.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a lurch of the vessel had rolled me under a huge copper\r\nkettle or my life would have been beaten out of me.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, dear Bulger!” I cried, in a tear-strangled voice, “this\r\nterrible discharge from heaven’s frozen artillery will surely end thy\r\nlife! Farewell, faithful dog; a long farewell!”\r\n\r\nGradually this terrifying shower of huge hail-stones lessened its fury,\r\nand strange to say, in doing so the falling stones drew most wonderful\r\nmusic from the great copper kettle which covered me like a huge buckler.\r\n\r\nThe wind moaned a deep bass and the pounding of the vessel kept time\r\nlike some gigantic drum.\r\n\r\nAlthough half-dead with fear, I listened with ecstatic pleasure to this\r\nawful concert played by the warring forces of nature. When it had\r\nceased, I looked out from my hiding-place.\r\n\r\nNot a living soul was in sight. Every seaman and officer had perished\r\nbeneath the strokes of the lightning, been crushed by the fall of hail,\r\nor swept by the resistless gale into the seething ocean.\r\n\r\nSo calm did it grow that I was beginning to take heart, when with a\r\nterrific swish and whirr, as if slit by some gigantic knife, the clouds\r\nparted and from the rent rushed blinding drifts of snow with such a wild\r\nand startling sweep and whirl that my knees swote together and I fell\r\nupon my face in utter despair.\r\n\r\nBut look! Had heaven slain the monster of the storm?\r\n\r\nThe snow was blood-red.\r\n\r\nThe sight froze the very marrow of my bones.\r\n\r\nI rolled over upon my back; my senses fled; death seemed to have\r\novertaken me.\r\n\r\nHow long I lay in this stupor I know not, but when I awoke the storm had\r\nspent its fury, the sun was sending down its brightest rays, the air was\r\npleasantly cool and bracing.\r\n\r\nSlowly my strength came back to me, and I emerged from my hiding-place,\r\ncrawling on my hands and feet, for I was too weak to stand upright at\r\nfirst. Little by little, however, I took heart, and, as I felt my blood\r\ngo tingling thro’ my veins, I made an effort and rose to my feet.\r\n\r\nYes, my worst fears had been realized.\r\n\r\nNot a living being had survived the storm.\r\n\r\nAs I walked upon the blood-red snow, every foot-fall brought forth most\r\npiteous sighs and groans.\r\n\r\n“What dread warning,” thought I, “does this mysterious murmuring give\r\nme? What is the meaning of these sobs and moans which issue from these\r\ncrimson crystals beneath the pressure of my feet? Am I walking upon the\r\nblood of my ancestors?”\r\n\r\nClinging to the frozen sheets, I crept slowly along the red-encrusted\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nBut stay!\r\n\r\nHark!\r\n\r\nAre my ears playing me still more fantastic tricks?\r\n\r\nNo! I’m wholly and entirely myself now, and as sure as the blood of the\r\nTrumps’ courses through my veins, that bark came from my faithful dog!\r\n\r\n“Bulger lives! Bulger lives!” I cried out in accents of the wildest joy;\r\nand breaking away from the hold of fear and trepidation, I rushed boldly\r\nforward, calling out “I’m coming, Bulger, I’m coming!” With reckless\r\ncourage I sprang from one frozen plank to another, until I stood upon\r\nthe quarter-deck. There, upon the hatch, sat, or rather lay, Bulger, for\r\nhis life was almost extinct. His teeth were locked upon the straps of a\r\nlife-preserver which he, ever thoughtful of my safety, was about to\r\nbring to me at the first outbreak of the storm, when its fury forced him\r\nto seek refuge under a water-cask, as his tracks on the snow indicated.\r\n\r\nAs quickly as my stiffened limbs would permit, I bounded forward, and\r\nthrowing myself on my knees, in the crimson snow,—which sent forth most\r\nheart-rending groans and sighs at the pressure of my body upon its\r\nblood-red surface—I clasped Bulger in my arms and our cries of joy\r\nmingled,—our tears ran together.\r\n\r\nAll my suffering was forgotten in that moment, for Bulger was alive, his\r\nhead was clasped to my breast.\r\n\r\nThe winds had now fallen, the sea had grown calm again, and I determined\r\nat once to quit the wreck if possible, for the setting sun revealed to\r\nme the shores of a beautiful land at the mouth of a small but extremely\r\npicturesque river, whose banks were rich in palm-trees, fruit-trees and\r\nflowering shrubs.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in lowering one of the boats which had happily escaped\r\nwith slight injuries, and being an expert seaman, I found no difficulty\r\nin rigging a tackle and lowering first, Bulger, and then myself into the\r\nboat, and paddling leisurely towards the shore.\r\n\r\nHere I drew the boat high and dry on the beach, and calling out gayly to\r\nfaithful Bulger to follow me, I clambered up the bank and pushed boldly\r\nforward to survey the fair land upon which a strange fate had set our\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first, I became conscious of the terrible hunger that was\r\ngnawing at my vitals—a fact which proved to me that I must have lain in\r\nan unconscious state beneath the huge kettle for at least two days if\r\nnot more.\r\n\r\nBulger raised his kind eyes to me, and then bounding off to one of the\r\nfruit trees, ran around it, barking joyfully.\r\n\r\nI shook one of the branches and the ripe fruit fell in abundance to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIts odor was so delicious that although it was unknown to me, I had no\r\nhesitation in partaking of it most freely, Bulger following my example,\r\na fact which convinced me that it could not be otherwise than wholesome.\r\nA long, deep draught from a limpid spring refreshed us both greatly; but\r\nas the sun was sinking rapidly, and as I now began to feel the effects\r\nof the rack, strain and weariness resulting from the terrible experience\r\nof the past day or so, I called out to Bulger:\r\n\r\n“Come, dear, faithful fellow, let us seek out a fit place to pass the\r\nnight; some nook shielded by wide-spreading branches, where there is\r\nplenty of soft boughs to make a bed with.”\r\n\r\nAs the country was quite level, I sighted a grove at some distance, and\r\nthither we directed our steps.\r\n\r\nIt had now grown quite dark. We quickened our pace, for I was too\r\nprudent a traveler to care to expose myself to the night dew.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the grove there appeared to be a low wall on one side of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“This way, Bulger,” said I, “this long line of boulders will protect us\r\nfrom the night winds, if any should rise. Let us creep under its edge\r\nand lay our tired limbs down on the soft grass.” He looked up with\r\nsoftened gaze and gave one or two consenting wags to his tail.\r\n\r\nNestling close under the edges of several of the largest of the\r\nboulders, at a point where they formed a sort of sheltered nook, we soon\r\nfell into a deep sleep, I sitting half upright and Bulger pillowing his\r\nhead upon my lap.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice in the course of the night I awoke to find my brow beaded\r\nwith perspiration. I put my hand on Bulger; he too was awake, and his\r\ntongue was lolling from his mouth. Both of us seemed to have been seized\r\nwith a strange fever. The direst forebodings took possession of me. Had\r\nwe landed upon a shore along which lurked some deadly miasm? Possibly we\r\nmight not live to see the light of another day. It required all my\r\nself-control to banish such terrible thoughts from my mind. But so tired\r\nwas I to the very bone that I soon fell asleep again, reassured as I was\r\nby the example set me by Bulger. It was, however, a fitful slumber, for\r\nthe heat of our bodies had now become so great that the very ground upon\r\nwhich we were lying felt warm to my touch. At length, to my joy, I\r\ncaught the first, faint glimpse of the dawn. I was now in a perfect glow\r\nfrom head to foot. And so was Bulger. Suddenly it burst upon my mind\r\nthat possibly we might have lain down in a volcanic region; that,\r\nmayhap, fierce, subterranean fires were raging beneath our very heads. I\r\nrose to my knees with a bound, and placed both of my hands upon the\r\nnearest boulder. Fancy my horror upon feeling that its surface was not\r\nonly hot, but that it yielded to the pressure of my hands, and gave\r\nforth groans, hissings and rumblings. In an instant I was on my feet.\r\nBulger did not wait to be called. Determined to verify my\r\nsuspicions,—for discretion was always a reasonable part of my valor, I\r\nhastened from one boulder to another within the circle where we had been\r\nlying, and pressed my hands upon them with all my strength. Deep,\r\nrumbling and hissing sounds came forth from the ground everywhere about\r\nme, and seemed to awaken responsive cries far and near, as if one giant\r\ntossing in his sleep disturbed the slumbers of his fellows.\r\n\r\n“Bulger!” I cried, “we stand upon the ground of death; this is but the\r\nouter wall of a crater, it is aglow with subterranean heat; only the\r\nmerest shell—so thin that it yields to my pressure—is between us and\r\ndestruction. Fly, fly, faithful dog!”\r\n\r\nThe morning sun now burst forth with a flood of golden light.\r\n\r\nAs far as my eye could reach, extended this same boulder-like parapet,\r\nshutting out my gaze from the abyss through which the volcano was now\r\nabout to spout its liquid fire; for all at once the boulders began to\r\nrock from side to side, giving forth such dreadful rumblings that I knew\r\nthe eruption was to be preceded by an earthquake.\r\n\r\nA sickening fear seized hold of me; my legs bent like pipe stems,\r\nbeneath the weight of my body.\r\n\r\nBulger saw that his loved master was chained to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe refused to abandon me.\r\n\r\nThe whole wall, as far as my eye could reach, now trembled and rocked,\r\nthreatening to engulf us every instant.\r\n\r\nWith a mighty effort I pulled myself together, and, followed by Bulger,\r\ndarted away.\r\n\r\nThe measure of my horror was not complete.\r\n\r\nWith terrific rumblings, gurglings, hissing and groaning, the whole row\r\nof rocks now danced in violent agitation, and then, like so many\r\ngigantic balls, rolled by huge monsters at play, these boulders,\r\npropelled with fearful violence by the outburst of the volcano—as I\r\nsupposed—came thundering down after our retreating forms, threatening us\r\nwith a terrible death.\r\n\r\nBulger, running at my side, ever and anon sent out a mournful whine, as\r\nif to bid me an eternal farewell.\r\n\r\n“Fly, Bulger! Faster, faster, good Bulger!” I called to him, as the roar\r\nand rumble of the advancing wall increased.\r\n\r\nNow each and every boulder seemed urged on its course by some mysterious\r\nforce of its own.\r\n\r\nAs I glanced over my shoulder, I could see that they were gaining in\r\nvelocity, bounding, springing, now in single file, now three abreast,\r\nwhile the frightful and unearthly din and rumble went ever on\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nThey were gaining upon us.\r\n\r\nMy legs again threatened to bend under the weight of my body and topple\r\nit over to certain and awful death, when a last glance revealed to me\r\nthe terrible truth.\r\n\r\n“Bulger! they are alive!”\r\n\r\nA sharp, despairing yelp came from my poor dog.\r\n\r\n“They’re alive, I tell you! Some legion of monsters, devils, for aught I\r\nknow, escaped from the depths of Tartarus, intent to roll over us and\r\ncrush the life from our puny bodies!”\r\n\r\nAgain we redoubled our efforts.\r\n\r\n“For your life, Bulger!” I gasped, “for your life! Look! the wood, the\r\nwood!”\r\n\r\nHe caught my meaning, and gave a sharp, encouraging bark.\r\n\r\nBut no, it was useless.\r\n\r\nMy strength had been used to its last poor throb.\r\n\r\nIt grew dark before my eyes.\r\n\r\nA palsying fear laid hold of my heart.\r\n\r\nMy limbs stiffened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGER’S AND MY WILD FLIGHT WHEN PURSUED BY THE\r\nROUNDBODIES.]\r\n\r\nI threw one last glance upon Bulger.\r\n\r\nHe answered me with a look of most tender affection, and then we both\r\ntripped, staggered, stumbled, fell headlong, side by side, while\r\nseemingly ten thousand living boulders, with awful shrieks, groans, and\r\ngurgling sounds, hung like a shadow over us for an instant, and all was\r\nblack as night.\r\n\r\nI felt my protuberant brow ground into the earth and the last bit of\r\nlife crushed out of me.\r\n\r\nMy last though was:\r\n\r\n“Bulger! O, Bulger! What a terrible death! But O, what a kind Providence\r\nto let us die together!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Rise! stunted, misshapen thing! Rise! thou wafer man, thou slice of\r\nhumanity with cleft edges!”\r\n\r\nIt was not so much the thundering tones of this strange, human monster\r\nwhich caused me to sit bolt upright, rub my eyes and make a superhuman\r\neffort to collect my sadly scattered senses, as it was the caresses of\r\nmy faithful Bulger, who was running from one side of me to the other,\r\nshowering kisses upon my face and hands and whining piteously.\r\n\r\nAfter a hard struggle the shadows were lifted from my eyes. My heart\r\nsank within me at sight of that wall of living boulders encircling us,\r\nwith their fierce visages turned, half in wonder, half in rage, upon\r\nthe, to them, two funny beings as utterly unlike themselves as each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBut love is always stronger than fear.\r\n\r\nStretching out my arms and drawing Bulger close to my breast, I cried\r\nout:\r\n\r\n“O, Bulger! do I really live? Am I not still the object of some demon’s\r\nsportive malice?”\r\n\r\nAt sound of my voice the round-bodied monsters broke out into a hideous\r\nchorus of deep, rumbling laughter, during which their bodies rolled from\r\nside to side.\r\n\r\nThen, as they pressed wildly forward, with fierce ejaculations of anger\r\nor impatience, it seemed as if Bulger and I had been only saved from one\r\ndeath to be set face to face with another.\r\n\r\n“Alas! is there no power,” thought I, “to save us from the furious\r\nimpatience of these reckless monsters?”\r\n\r\nSuddenly a terrible voice sounded loud above the din:\r\n\r\n“Roll backward, Round bodies! What meaneth this unseemly impatience in\r\nthe presence of your King?”\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the round-bodied monsters rolled silently backwards.\r\n\r\nAll was calm again.\r\n\r\nTurning to his neighbor, the King exclaimed, with a gurgling laugh:\r\n\r\n“Why, by my royal girth, its voice is all the world like one of the toy\r\npipes of our baby prince!”\r\n\r\n“‘Its? Its?’” I repeated, with fire flashing from my upturned eyes.\r\n“Know, Sir Monster, that I am not a ‘thing,’ but a perfect man; a baron\r\nby birth, a scholar by profession, a traveler by choice.”\r\n\r\nAt this outburst on my part, the crowd of living balls again sent up a\r\ndeep, rumbling peel of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Silence!” commanded the King, and then he continued: “Well, well, then,\r\nbaron,—whatever that may be—but I think I ought to say ‘little baron,’\r\nfor by my royal roundness, thou art a wee, puny being! Let it be as thou\r\nsayest, but tell me, I implore thee, what is this walking box on four\r\nlegs, which nature seems to have left unfinished?”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he raised his terrible hand with fingers strong enough to\r\ncrush me as I might a puff-ball, and waved it toward Bulger.\r\n\r\nThis contemptuous sneer did not escape Bulger.\r\n\r\nHe broke out into a volume of sharp, angry barks, and showed his white\r\nteeth in the most threatening manner.\r\n\r\nUpon which the monsters rolled back in mock terror and consternation,\r\ncrying out:\r\n\r\n“The King! The King! Save the King! The walking box is filled with\r\nexplosives; it may fly into pieces!”\r\n\r\nWhen the hubbub was over, and the King had commanded silence, I stepped\r\nboldly forward and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Unfinished! What meanest thou, thou globe-shaped monster?”\r\n\r\nThe term “globe” seemed to please his majesty very much.\r\n\r\nA great, wrinkled smile overran his huge countenance.\r\n\r\n“Mean?” he ejaculated, with a deep, gurgling, chuckling laugh. “Mean?\r\nwhy, little baron—whatever that may be—see for thyself. Has not Nature\r\nleft useless flaps at one end of the box, and a still more useless bit\r\nof rope hanging down from the other?”\r\n\r\nThis insulting allusion to Bulger’s ears and tail seemed to be perfectly\r\nunderstood by him, for he fairly bristled with rage, and advanced upon\r\nthe round-bodied monster, snapping, snarling, and showing his teeth.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the deep, rumbling laughter again broke forth, and the cry,\r\n“Save the King! Save the King!” went up in mock earnestness.\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in appeasing Bulger’s anger by means of a few\r\naffectionate words and tender caresses, I determined to make inquiry as\r\nto our whereabouts, and to ascertain who the strange beings were among\r\nwhom capricious fate had so unceremoniously cast Bulger and me.\r\n\r\n“Where are we, ball-shaped giant?” I inquired in my strongest voice,\r\n“and who are you?”\r\n\r\nAgain the monster screwed his leathery face up in a deep, wrinkled\r\nsmile. The reason of his good will, as I afterwards learned, arose from\r\nthe fact that I had bestowed the terms “globe,” “round,” “ball-shaped,”\r\netc., upon him, for it seemed that these wonderfully formed beings were\r\nextremely vain of their roundness, and that nothing could be uttered\r\nmore pleasing and complimentary to them than to make use of such words\r\nand expressions as “ball,” “orb,” “sphere,” “round-bodied,”\r\n“bullet-shaped,” etc.; that in their land, the greatest dignities honors\r\nand titles of nobility were awarded those whose bodies showed most\r\nperfect roundness; that in proportion as one’s body deviated from the\r\nshape of a true sphere, he became degraded and excluded from society.\r\n\r\nTo such wretched subjects the King assigned the performance of all mean\r\nlabor. They were the “squares,” or outcasts, whom anybody might insult\r\nor even enslave with impunity. The richer ones were sometimes able to\r\nhide their deformity by means of padding, and in this manner conceal\r\ntheir uneven motion in rolling from the keen eyes of the King; but the\r\npoor ones, by their inability to correct their physical defects, at once\r\nattracted the King’s attention, when he caused his people to roll up and\r\ndown before him, while he kept up a searching lookout for “wabblers” or\r\nuneven rollers.\r\n\r\n“Well, little baron—whatever that may be,” replied the King, “or shall I\r\ncall thee Wafer-man with cleft edges? Know, then, that I am King\r\nBô-gôô-gôô, Monarch of the Roundbodies; that these, are some of my\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n“Know, furthermore, little baron—whatever that may be—that this island\r\nis my kingdom, in which no one rules saving me, and that unless it may\r\nplease my royal daughter Rōlâ-Bōlâ to keep thee and thy attendant, the\r\nwalking box with cord and flaps, as curiosities to amuse her, thou and\r\nthy companion perish at sundown, for, little baron—whatever that may\r\nbe—it is my royal will, and so it was my father’s, and his father’s, and\r\nso back a thousand years, that no living creature shall set foot upon\r\nthe shores of my domain and not pay for his temerity by being crushed to\r\ndeath, literally ground into the soil, until he become a very part of\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nBulger appeared to grasp the meaning of this fierce speech, which was\r\ndelivered in thundering tones, and accompanied by hideous contortions of\r\nthe speaker’s great, round visage, flaming as the crimson disc of a\r\ntropical sun in the western sky, and followed by an outburst of grunts,\r\ngroans and gurglings from the assembled Roundbodies; and, in spite of\r\nhis inborn courage, his tail fell between his legs and he slunk nearer\r\nto me with a low, anxious whine.\r\n\r\nBut when good Bulger saw the calm expression of my countenance, he\r\nquickly recovered himself; his tail resumed its graceful curl, and as I\r\nfaced King Bô-gôô-gôô with an unruffled exterior, to make reply to the\r\nlatter’s horrible threat, Bulger, too, placed himself at my side with a\r\ndefiant air.\r\n\r\n“Most gracious Sphere! Most royal Globe! Roundest monarch of the great,\r\nround world! true, I have set foot on the shores of thy domain, but it\r\nwas not, most majestic Sphericity, through choice. A fearful storm, in\r\nwhich the warring elements seemed bent upon the destruction of the\r\nuniverse, during which the great ocean hurled itself against the walls\r\nof heaven as if to beat out the very stars, while the wide-mouthed gale\r\nswooped down upon this petty earth with seeming intent to swallow it and\r\nall it contained—?”\r\n\r\nI could speak no further.\r\n\r\nThe Roundbodies broke in upon me with such dismal groans and cries that\r\nI stood as if rooted to the earth.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” thought I, “they, too, felt the terrible blows of that storm-demon\r\nwhich so nearly beat out the life from mine and from Bulger’s bodies!”\r\n\r\nWaving my hand as a signal for silence, I proceeded:\r\n\r\n“I bow before the will of thy spherical Majesty, whatever it may be! At\r\nthe same time, I would beg to call the attention of your Imperial\r\nRoundness to the fact that, in the systems of law of all the nations of\r\nthe globe, a man may not be held responsible for an act which he is made\r\nto commit by a force or strength greater than his own.”\r\n\r\nI saw that my flattery was telling upon King Bô-gôô-gôô, so I proceeded\r\nto make a still further application of the same remedy:\r\n\r\n“However, most Royal Globe and perfect Sphere of Strength and Beauty,\r\nif, in thy great wisdom, thou dost decide that we must die, crushed\r\nbeneath the weight of thy people’s bodies, so be it! Great ball-shaped\r\nmonarch, I am but a bit and shred of humanity, and how may I dare to\r\noppose the will of your right royal Sphericity?”\r\n\r\nKing Bô-gôô-gôô smiled till his huge double teeth could be seen\r\nglittering in his cavernous mouth, like white rocks in a half-lighted\r\npit, and his body swayed from one side to another in his gigantic glee.\r\n\r\n“Send for the royal princess!” he roared.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds, in answer to his command, a Roundbody came rolling\r\nacross the plain with the swiftness of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of retainers fell back, and the new-comer arrested her flight\r\nby the side of King Bô-gôô-gôô.\r\n\r\nI could not see that she was a bit more beautiful than those about her,\r\nalthough she was a royal princess.\r\n\r\nTrue, she was a globe of smaller girth, her face was somewhat less\r\nrepellent and beneath a long and heavy fringe of lashes, I caught\r\nglimpses of a pair of good-natured, roguish eyes, and my perfect\r\nknowledge of human and brute nature told me at a glance that if I could\r\nbut gain the good will of that strange being, Bulger and I would be\r\nsafe!\r\n\r\n“My dear, little round papa,” cried Rōlâ-Bōlâ—for such proved to be her\r\nname, “Where did those funny things come from? Are they really alive?\r\nWont they bite or sting? What do they eat? What shall I keep them in?\r\nWill you make me a cage for them? Oh, I am so, so, so, so, so, so, so,\r\nso, so glad!” and she bounded about, now this way, now that, now into\r\nthe air like an animated rubber ball, drumming like a partridge all the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nBehold us, then, Bulger and me, prisoners in the land of the\r\nRoundbodies, with the Princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ as our keeper!\r\n\r\nHope sank low within our poor hearts.\r\n\r\nI dared not breathe a word in opposition to the will of King Bô-gôô-gôô\r\nor the caprice of Rōlâ-Bōlâ lest the order should be revoked.\r\n\r\nAt least, in the keeping of the Princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ, we would be more\r\nlikely to receive gentle treatment, and, what was almost a matter of\r\nlife and death, we should have great chances of making our escape from\r\nthe island of King Bô-gôô-gôô.\r\n\r\nWe were commanded to follow the Princess.\r\n\r\nAs Bulger and I started after Rōlâ-Bōlâ, with a brisk gait, the very\r\nclouds fairly snapt asunder, so great was the shout of laughter which\r\nthe Roundbodies sent up.\r\n\r\nSeemingly, it had not occurred to them until that moment how\r\nridiculously different our mode of locomotion was from theirs.\r\n\r\n“Look! look! O, King!” they cried, “he can neither roll nor hop! See how\r\nhe edges along, leaning first on one foot and then on the other! He\r\nwalks on his toe nails! Mark his companion, too! What monsters of\r\nclumsiness! How they rock and wabble! Why doth he not spring? Why doth\r\nhe pound the earth as if he were beating flax?”\r\n\r\nTo all this mocking and jeering, Bulger and I turned a deaf ear,\r\nfollowing our mistress, who ever and anon, turned her soft, black,\r\nmischievous eyes encouragingly upon us, as her head came uppermost.\r\n\r\nImagine our surprise when Rōlâ-Bōlâ halted at the beginning of a path\r\nhaving a gentle descent, and said:\r\n\r\n“This is the entrance to the royal habitation. Follow me and fear\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nIn a few moments we found ourselves in the outer room of a vast\r\nunderground dwelling, consisting of corridors, chambers, dormitories,\r\nbanquet-halls and arenas.\r\n\r\nAll the habitations of the Roundbodies are subterranean.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nThis you shall know anon.\r\n\r\nBulger and I were conducted to very pleasant quarters—well-lighted, as\r\nwere all the rooms of the palace, by means of vast slabs of rock\r\ncrystal, of which the roof was made, by a “square” or “lôb-bô” as he is\r\ncalled in the language of the Roundbodies, that is, one not perfectly\r\nround in form, and hence degraded to the position of serving man.\r\nDoubtless, long before this, the reader has grown impatient at my\r\nsilence concerning the strange beings among whom Bulger and I now found\r\nourselves prisoners.\r\n\r\nWho were the Roundbodies?\r\n\r\nKnow then, gentle reader, that they were—mark well my words—the sole\r\nliving creatures on the island of Gô-gû-lâh, upon which a strange fate\r\nhad cast us. Whether or not any other beings had ever inhabited the\r\nisland was unknown to them.\r\n\r\nI found, upon conversing with their learned men, that there was a legend\r\nin existence among them—dim and shadowy in its details, from the long\r\nflight of centuries that it had come down through—that many thousands of\r\nyears ago they had been quite like human beings, who walk upright, with\r\nbodies almost, if not quite, as long as mine; but that owing to the\r\nunvarying recurrence of terrible storms, of wind, rain, hail and snow,\r\naccompanied by the bursting of deafening thunderbolts, in fact, such as\r\nI had experienced, which swept over the island twelve times in the year,\r\ncoming and going with a regularity as astonishing as their force is\r\nterrific, everything upright had long ago been swept from the land; that\r\ntheir ancestors, yielding to the irresistible forces of Nature, had\r\ngradually bent their bodies before these resistless winds, until even\r\nthe time when they walked upright had been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis was but the first change wrought by the forces which surrounded\r\nthem. When overtaken by these wild winds, they soon learned that their\r\nonly safety lay in rolling themselves up as much into the shape of balls\r\nas possible, so that the tornado would be powerless to pick them up and\r\nhurl them to destruction.\r\n\r\nAnother transformation now began to make itself apparent.\r\n\r\nTheir bodies, as centuries came and went, little by little, took on the\r\nrounded form they then had.\r\n\r\nStill clinging to the desperate chance for life on these storm-swept\r\nplains, they drew down their heads and pressed in their limbs until\r\nthese had made recesses for them, as some tortoises draw their legs so\r\nclosely to their bodies that the eye fails to distinguish even the\r\noutline of the limb.\r\n\r\nThe last change that came upon these globe-shaped people was a very\r\nnatural one: their arms took on a greater development of superhuman\r\nstrength, while their legs grew shorter and shorter, until they\r\nconsisted of little more than two broad, flexible feet, which they made\r\nuse of mainly to propel their round bodies like huge balls across the\r\nvast plains of their island home.\r\n\r\nNow, while they still dread the terrible blasts, yet is it rather an\r\ninherited fear, for at last they have become the true children of the\r\ngale.\r\n\r\nIf it should happen to blow in the direction of their homes, they simply\r\nallow it to help them on their way by rolling them across the plain.\r\nWhile, now and then, a lôb-bô, or “square” Roundbody, so to speak, would\r\nbe blown into the ocean, yet for nearly a century not a single, genuine\r\nRoundbody had been caught up in the pitiless blast. As well might the\r\nwind attempt to pick up the round stones of the ocean strand.\r\n\r\nOne of the things which early attracted my attention in King\r\nBô-gôô-gôô’s palace, was the hangings, apparently of the softest\r\nleather, worked in mosaic patterns of transcendent beauty.\r\n\r\nImagine my surprise when told by the gentle princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ that they\r\nwere simply the natural leaves from the various trees growing on the\r\nisland, untouched by dye or stain of any kind.\r\n\r\nThey were so tough that my strength sufficed not to tear one in two.\r\n\r\nNoticing my wide-opened eyes turned inquiringly upon her, the gentle\r\nRōlâ-Bōlâ cried out with a soft, low gurgle:\r\n\r\n“Go into the royal garden, Tôô-tôô-lō; that is, little ‘flute-man,’ and\r\nsee for thyself.”\r\n\r\nNow, for the first, I learned the secret of the presence of such\r\nbeautiful trees and shrubs upon this storm-swept land. Every leaf was as\r\nthick and as strong as leather, and the trunks and boughs were exactly\r\nof the nature of India rubber, so that, with a small bit which I brought\r\nhome with me in one of my pockets, I could erase pencil-marks with the\r\ngreatest ease.\r\n\r\nTo such foliage as this a tornado had no terrors.\r\n\r\nWhen the storm struck these trees they went to the ground, until it had\r\nspent its fury. In a few hours the tropical sun lifted them again, and\r\nthe beauty of their foliage was quite unharmed.\r\n\r\nTo return to the poor princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ:\r\n\r\nBulger began to fret and worry beneath the strain of our captivity.\r\n\r\nI was constantly on the alert for a chance to escape, but none offered.\r\nIn fact, we were, I began to fear, prisoners for life.\r\n\r\nTrue, it was a pleasant captivity, for the gentle Rōlâ-Bōlâ almost\r\nkilled us with dainty feeding, and our only toil was dancing, singing\r\nand capering for her amusement.\r\n\r\nNight and day, the sole gateway of the royal habitation was guarded by a\r\ntriple row of round-bodied sentinels, so fierce-visaged, so\r\nmighty-handed, that my heart grew sick as I gazed upon them.\r\n\r\nTo add to my despair, I now made a discovery which seemed to seal my\r\nfate forever—the princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ had become enamored of me!\r\n\r\nWhat to me, at first, had seemed but a playful trick, to wit, her\r\npinching my little toe ever and anon, had, as I was casually informed by\r\none of the learned Roundbodies, in the course of a discussion with him,\r\na terrible significance.\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn declaration of love!\r\n\r\nOh! miserable me!\r\n\r\nAnd a declaration, too, which, coming from a woman to a man, it was\r\ncertain, sure, inevitable death to ignore!\r\n\r\nAnd yet I might be saved!\r\n\r\nFor the custom—made sacred by the observance of long ages—required the\r\nman to pursue the woman, who pretended to be frightened and extremely\r\nsolicitous of escaping him, and while revolving with the same velocity\r\nas she, to pinch her little toe in return.\r\n\r\nThis ended the matter.\r\n\r\nThe couple was now betrothed.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the power of man to publish bans of greater strength.\r\n\r\nIf the man gave one pinch, the marriage was solemnized the following\r\nday; if two, the second day after, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut I was not a Roundbody!\r\n\r\nHow could I possibly comply with the ancient custom of the land?\r\n\r\nAh! Woman! Woman! it matters not whether thou belongest to the\r\nRoundbodies or to the Longbodies, in affairs of the heart thy ingenuity\r\nand subtlety overmatch the philosophy of man!\r\n\r\nWhen it was made known to the princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ that the royal\r\ncounselors had, after mature deliberation, reached the conclusion that\r\nthe laws of the land—made sacred by the observance of ages—forbade any\r\nsuch union contemplated by her, she flew into a towering or, rather, I\r\nshould call it, a bounding passion, for, from one end of her spacious\r\nsalon to the other, sidewise and lengthwise, she bounded about like a\r\ngreat ball bouncing under the play of an invisible bat.\r\n\r\nAlternately she wept, laughed, scolded and threatened.\r\n\r\nBut it made little difference how she began her tirades, they all had\r\nthe same ending:\r\n\r\n“I say, I shall marry Tôô-tôô-lō!”\r\n\r\nKing Bô-gôô-gôô, thinking to pacify his daughter, sent her messengers\r\nbearing the most beautiful presents; but she received them with disdain,\r\nscattering them on the floor.\r\n\r\nThings went on this way for several days.\r\n\r\nKing Bô-gôô-gôô was horrified to find that the princess had eaten\r\nnothing for forty-eight hours, and that she was actually losing her\r\nbeautifully round shape, for which she had so justly been famous.\r\n\r\nBulger saw plainly that something awful was going on, and he, too,\r\nbecame so worked up that he refused to eat or drink.\r\n\r\nI passed most of my time going from his room to the princess\r\nRōlâ-Bōlâ’s, endeavoring to persuade them to take food.\r\n\r\nBut all in vain.\r\n\r\nOne morning the King’s daughter met me with demonstrations of the\r\nwildest delight, laughing, singing, bounding and rolling about like mad.\r\nSo beside herself was she that, forgetting her great weight and my puny\r\nbuild, she rolled against me and sent me flying like a little ten-pin\r\nstruck by a monstrous ball.\r\n\r\nBy actual measurement I was thrown thirty feet, but, fortunately, struck\r\nagainst a heavy hanging which broke my fall.\r\n\r\nBulger gave a piteous howl.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to get an idea that Rōlâ-Bōlâ had struck me purposely.\r\n\r\nWell, in a word, the cause of this frantic joy was simply this: The\r\nprincess had finally thought out a solution to the terrible problem\r\nwhich had been for weeks torturing her mind.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, it was as follows:\r\n\r\nI should be placed in the boughs of a tree just high enough to clear her\r\nbody. She then was to roll under me, and at the right moment, I was to\r\nlean downward and pinch her little toe when it came uppermost.\r\n\r\nIn vain I assured her that I should grow dizzy and fall headlong to the\r\nground, breaking my neck, or, at very least, dislocating it.\r\n\r\nBut no, I need have no fear.\r\n\r\nShe would watch over me.\r\n\r\nShe would turn and catch me in time.\r\n\r\nThe royal counsellors were at once called together.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ was laid before them.\r\n\r\nAt first they sent up a deep and ominous rumble of disagreement.\r\n\r\nBut Rōlâ-Bōlâ’s messengers were at hand with most costly presents, and\r\nit all ended in their finding an almost similar case in their books,\r\nwhere a wounded prince, who was quite unable to roll an inch, had been\r\nplaced upon an elevated platform in order that his round-bodied\r\nsweetheart might pass beneath and he be enabled to pinch her little toe\r\nwhile it was in the air at the highest point from the ground.\r\n\r\nSeeing that it would be useless to make further opposition, I now\r\nsubmitted with a good grace, for it was plain to me that once the\r\nhusband of the princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ I should become, to a certain extent,\r\none of the family and be accorded greater liberty, by means of which I\r\nconfidently hoped to make my escape from the land of the Roundbodies.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the marriage were now begun with extraordinary haste,\r\nin order to have all things ready for the first feast-day in the\r\ncalendar.\r\n\r\nAs the time drew near, however, I somewhat lost my courage.\r\n\r\n“Was I not,” I asked myself, “simply lending my aid in forging my own\r\nfetters, in laying chains upon my neck, which would render it impossible\r\nfor Bulger and me ever to set eyes again upon our beloved home?”\r\n\r\nI became very nervous, and found it impossible to catch a wink of sleep.\r\n\r\nAt last I resolved to postpone my fate, at least for several days.\r\n\r\nAnd this was my scheme:—\r\n\r\nI should explain to the fair Rōlâ-Bōlâ how utterly impossible it would\r\nbe for me, in my fright and anxiety, to get my thumb and finger upon her\r\nlittle toe at all, as she revolved swiftly beneath me.\r\n\r\nI therefore would implore her to roll very slowly.\r\n\r\nAnd then my scheme would be to seize her foot, hold it fast, and pinch\r\nthe little toe a score of times at least!\r\n\r\nEach pinch would be a clear gain of a day!\r\n\r\nOur wedding-day dawned at last.\r\n\r\nThe King’s wine was dealt out to the people with liberal hand.\r\n\r\nMirth and gayety resounded on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe skies were one vast expanse of cloudless blue.\r\n\r\nThe flowering shrubs breathed out the most delightful odors.\r\n\r\nThe air was deliciously balmy.\r\n\r\nThe painted foliage hung in graceful festoons, unmoved by even a breath\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nTo his evident disgust, Bulger was decorated with a necklace of leaf\r\nmosaic of most delicate workmanship.\r\n\r\nHad I not reproved him with a shake of the head, he would quickly have\r\nshaken off this useless adornment.\r\n\r\nVast crowds of the Roundbodies covered the plain as far as the eye could\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nChildren rolled in troops after their parents, like marbles chasing up a\r\ncannon ball.\r\n\r\nAt times I observed that the mothers, in order to amuse their little\r\nones, or to quell some discussion which had broken out among them,\r\nhalted by the wayside, and catching up three or four of them, tossed\r\nthem into the air as a juggler does his balls, sometimes keeping three\r\nor more of them on the fly and one in each hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sight, and amused me so much that I quite insisted upon\r\nhalting the wedding procession in order that I might observe it more\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nBut the fair Rōlâ-Bōlâ was very impatient, and chided me in unmeasured\r\nterms for my lack of dignity.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I now began to notice a very evident desire on the part of the\r\nmanagers of the wedding arrangements to hurry things up.\r\n\r\nKing Bô-gôô-gôô ever and anon turned an anxious eye toward the horizon.\r\n\r\nAnd then there would follow a whispered consultation with the\r\nsoothsayers and magicians.\r\n\r\nBehold me at last mounted upon my—scaffold, I had almost said—for such\r\nit seemed to be.\r\n\r\nA terrible, tightening sensation took hold of my heart.\r\n\r\nThe air seemed too heavy to breathe.\r\n\r\nI gasped like a fish thrown up on dry land.\r\n\r\n“Let the marriage ceremony begin this instant, and move apace!” roared\r\nBô-gôô-gôô.\r\n\r\n“Make ready, Tôô-tôô-lō!” cried one of the royal councillors.\r\n\r\nI turned to survey the multitude, and then prostrated myself upon the\r\nplatform under which the princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ was to pass.\r\n\r\n“She has started! She comes like the wind! She is here!” Such were the\r\ncries which arose from the vast multitude.\r\n\r\nWith head and shoulders thrust through the opening in the platform, I\r\nawaited my bride with bated breath and thumping heart.\r\n\r\nImagine my amazement when I saw her flash beneath me and disappear in\r\nthe crowd of Roundbodies, almost like a ball from a cannon.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely felt her body as it had rolled beneath me.\r\n\r\nAs for pinching her toe, that was certainly out of the question, seeing\r\nthat I had only caught a hurried glimpse of her white feet, and then all\r\nwas gone!\r\n\r\nIn an instant I was on my legs, and, advancing to the edge of the\r\nplatform, I raised my hand to signify to King Bô-gôô-gôô that I desired\r\nto be heard:\r\n\r\n“O, King with the globe-shaped body, hearken unto me! I have been\r\nwronged! There is vile treachery here! The judges of the land of\r\nGô-gû-lâh have been corrupted! I demand their blood! Not only have I not\r\npinched the little toe of the royal princess Rōlâ-Bōlâ, but I—”\r\n\r\nAt this instant, a deep, rumbling noise like a burst of distant\r\nartillery, cut short my harangue, by setting the air into such violent\r\nvibration that my lips moved without making the slightest sound.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this terrific “boom” upon the Roundbodies was astounding.\r\n\r\nThe wildest confusion came upon them.\r\n\r\nIn vain did King Bô-gôô-gôô command silence.\r\n\r\nThey rocked like the waves of the sea when struck by a sudden blast.\r\n\r\nThe most deafening groans and sighs rolled over the plains in a sort of\r\nhalf tuneful unison. Their faces blanched and they pressed together in\r\nthe most abject fear.\r\n\r\nAt last King Bô-gôô-gôô was himself again, and, with a terrific voice,\r\nawed his people into silence, crying out:\r\n\r\n“Ughgō! Raûlag pad Oüistimgâr!” (My people, the storm is upon us!\r\nProtect yourselves!)\r\n\r\nMore quickly than it takes me to tell it, the dreaded roar broke in upon\r\nthe stilly air.\r\n\r\nThe Roundbodies gathered their children and aged people into a group,\r\nand then formed double and triple walls about them.\r\n\r\n“Tôô-tôô-lō! Tôô-tôô-lō!”\r\n\r\nIt was Rōlâ-Bōlâ’s voice.\r\n\r\nBut other thoughts were in my mind at this dread moment.\r\n\r\nAgain it sounded forth in most piteous accents:\r\n\r\n“Tôô-tôô-lō! Tôô-tôô-lō!”\r\n\r\nTo that voice, now, the ears of the dead would have given more heed than\r\nmine!\r\n\r\nThe storm-fiend was galloping amain.\r\n\r\nQuicker than thought I swung myself down from the platform, and,\r\nencircling Bulger with my left arm, made my way back again.\r\n\r\nThe good dog was delighted to be with me again, although he was\r\ntrembling like an aspen leaf at the distant sound of the winds.\r\n\r\nHe well knew what was coming.\r\n\r\nBut look! The sunlight is gone!\r\n\r\nThe very air seems affrighted.\r\n\r\nA terrifying tremor of the ground beneath us causes the soles of our\r\nfeet to tingle and prickle.\r\n\r\n“Tôô-tôô-lō! Tôô-tôô-lō!”\r\n\r\nIt was Rōlâ-Bōlâ calling her lover away from the impending death with\r\nwhich the storm-cloud was fraught.\r\n\r\nHe was busy with one dearer to him than the weeping princess of the\r\nRoundbodies.\r\n\r\nHappily the platform had been constructed by lashing together the\r\nuprights and flooring by means of hempen cords. To loosen one of these\r\nand bind Bulger and myself securely to the wooden structure was the work\r\nof a moment.\r\n\r\nThe Roundbodies had followed my movements in silence, fairly stricken\r\ndumb with amazement at what seemed to them the work of a madman.\r\n\r\nWhen they could find their tongues, they motioned to me fiercely to\r\nleave the platform, crying:\r\n\r\n“Pôô-döeg! Pôô-döeg!” (What madness! What madness!)\r\n\r\nBut I was not mad!\r\n\r\nWhat is death but a thought?\r\n\r\nOne may live and yet be dead!\r\n\r\nLook! the terrible storm-king is coming! He is a greater monarch than\r\nthou, O mighty Bô-gôô-gôô!\r\n\r\n“Tôô-tôô-lō! Tôô-tôô-lō!”\r\n\r\nIt was the kind, good Rōlâ-Bōlâ’s last farewell!\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the roar of the coming gale drowned every sound of\r\nearth or its puny creatures.\r\n\r\nLook again! See the black monster, how he draws nearer and nearer, his\r\nhuge, shapeless, terrible body rolling and swaying as he rides along on\r\nhis black wings, while, like a gigantic serpent, his tail drags over the\r\nfair earth, hissing, writhing and curling, now on this side, now on\r\nthat, now coiling upward to gather strength, now beating and threshing\r\nthe plain with a roar mighty enough to plunge the stoutest heart into\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nAh, Bulger! It comes! ’Tis here! We move! It lifts us! Away! Away! We\r\nride on the bosom of the gale! What a roar! How dark! How black! The\r\nstorm-king strangles me! Bulger, I die—\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Where am I? Ah, Bulger, good dog! Has the princess called us yet?\r\n\r\n“King Bô-gôô-gôô comes to-day.\r\n\r\n“We must amuse him!”\r\n\r\nI made an effort to rise.\r\n\r\nThe cords held me down.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the shadows lifted from my mind, and thoughts of the\r\nstorm-king’s coming flashed through my brain, and how he had lifted the\r\nplatform upon which we were bound, and borne it away, away, as if it\r\nwere a feather caught up by the wind in play!\r\n\r\nSomething tickled my cheek.\r\n\r\nI raised my head.\r\n\r\nOh! joy unutterable! It was grain! Ay, golden grain!\r\n\r\nWheat, ready for the sickle!\r\n\r\nWe are saved! We must be near the habitations of man!\r\n\r\nAnd so we were.\r\n\r\nNay, more; we were not a thousand miles away from home.\r\n\r\nThus it was a mightier king than Bô-gôô-gôô, one to whom in my despair,\r\nI had appealed for aid, caught up my loved Bulger and me and bore us\r\naway from Gô-gû-lâh, the Land of the Roundbodies.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd here I end my story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HOME AGAIN!\r\n\r\n  THIS TIME FOR A GOOD, LONG REST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\n 1.
