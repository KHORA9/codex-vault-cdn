The explanation given is\r\nwholly erroneous, as I have discovered by working out an illustration in\r\nfigures. Moreover, the supposed coincidence of period is far from\r\ngeneral, and is not remarkable; for, as I have elsewhere attempted to\r\nshow, variations arising early in life have often been accumulated\r\nthrough sexual selection, being then commonly transmitted to both sexes.\r\nOn the other hand, variations arising late in life cannot fail to\r\ncoincide approximately in period with that of the process of sexual\r\nselection. Allusions to these erroneous views reappear in Vol. II. pp.\r\n161 and 237.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF FISHES, AMPHIBIANS,\r\nAND REPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FISHES: Courtship and battles of the males—Larger size of the\r\n  females—Males, bright colours and ornamental appendages; other\r\n  strange characters—Colours and appendages acquired by the\r\n  males during the breeding-season alone—Fishes with both sexes\r\n  brilliantly coloured—Protective colours—The less conspicuous\r\n  colours of the female cannot be accounted for on the principle\r\n  of protection—Male fishes building nests, and taking charge of\r\n  the ova and young. AMPHIBIANS: Differences in structure and\r\n  colour between the sexes—Vocal organs. REPTILES:\r\n  Chelonians—Crocodiles—Snakes, colours in some cases\r\n  protective—Lizards, battles of—Ornamental appendages—Strange\r\n  differences in structure between the sexes—Colours—Sexual\r\n  differences almost as great as with birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the great sub-kingdom of the Vertebrata, and will\r\ncommence with the lowest class, namely Fishes. The males of\r\nPlagiostomous fishes (sharks, rays) and of Chimæroid fishes are provided\r\nwith claspers which serve to retain the female, like the various\r\nstructures possessed by so many of the lower animals. Besides the\r\nclaspers, the males of many rays have clusters of strong sharp spines on\r\ntheir heads, and several rows along “the upper outer surface of their\r\npectoral fins.” These are present in the males of some species, which\r\nhave the other parts of their bodies smooth. They are only temporarily\r\ndeveloped during the breeding-season; and Dr. Günther suspects that they\r\nare brought into action as prehensile organs by the doubling inwards and\r\ndownwards of the two sides of the body. It is a remarkable fact that the\r\nfemales and not the males of some species, as of _Raia clavata_, have\r\ntheir backs studded with large hook-formed spines.[1]\r\n\r\nOwing to the element which fishes inhabit, little is known about their\r\ncourtship, and not much about their battles. The male stickleback\r\n(_Gasterosteus leiurus_) has been described as “mad with delight” when\r\nthe female comes out of her hiding-place and surveys the nest which he\r\nhas made for her. “He darts round her in every direction, then to his\r\naccumulated materials for the nest, then back again in an instant; and\r\nas she does not advance he endeavours to push her with his snout, and\r\nthen tries to pull her by the tail and side-spine to the nest.”[2] The\r\nmales are said to be polygamists;[3] they are extraordinarily bold and\r\npugnacious, whilst “the females are quite pacific.” Their battles are at\r\ntimes desperate; “for these puny combatants fasten tight on each other\r\nfor several seconds, tumbling over and over again, until their strength\r\nappears completely exhausted.” With the rough-tailed stickleback (_G.\r\ntrachurus_) the males whilst fighting swim round and round each other,\r\nbiting and endeavouring to pierce each other with their raised lateral\r\nspines. The same writer adds,[4] “the bite of these little furies is\r\nvery severe. They also use their lateral spines with such fatal effect,\r\nthat I have seen one during a battle absolutely rip his opponent quite\r\nopen, so that he sank to the bottom and died.” When a fish is conquered,\r\n“his gallant bearing forsakes him; his gay colours fade away; and he\r\nhides his disgrace among his peaceable companions, but is for some time\r\nthe constant object of his conqueror’s persecution.”\r\n\r\nThe male salmon is as pugnacious as the little stickleback; and so is\r\nthe male trout, as I hear from Dr. Günther. Mr. Shaw saw a violent\r\ncontest between two male salmons which lasted the whole day; and Mr. R.\r\nBuist, Superintendent of Fisheries, informs me that he has often watched\r\nfrom the bridge at Perth the males driving away their rivals whilst the\r\nfemales were spawning. The males “are constantly fighting and tearing\r\neach other on the spawning-beds, and many so injure each other as to\r\ncause the death of numbers, many being seen swimming near the banks of\r\nthe river in a state of exhaustion, and apparently in a dying state.”[5]\r\nThe keeper of the Stormontfield breeding-ponds visited, as Mr. Buist\r\ninforms me, in June, 1868, the northern Tyne, and found about 300 dead\r\nsalmon, all of which with one exception were males; and he was convinced\r\nthat they had lost their lives by fighting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Head of male of common salmon (_Salmo salar_)\r\nduring the breeding-season.\r\n\r\n(This drawing, as well as all the others in the present chapter, have\r\nbeen executed by the well-known artist, Mr. G. Ford, under the kind\r\nsuperintendence of Dr. Günther, from specimens in the British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe most curious point about the male salmon is that during the\r\nbreeding-season, besides a slight change in colour, “the lower jaw\r\nelongates, and a cartilaginous projection turns upwards from the point,\r\nwhich, when the jaws are closed, occupies a deep cavity between the\r\nintermaxillary bones of the upper jaw.”[6] (Figs. 26 and 27.) In our\r\nsalmon this change of structure lasts only during the breeding-season;\r\nbut in the _Salmo lycaodon_ of N.W. America the change, as Mr. J. K.\r\nLord[7] believes, is permanent and best marked in the older males which\r\nhave previously ascended the rivers. In these old males the jaws become\r\ndeveloped into immense hook-like projections, and the teeth grow into\r\nregular fangs, often more than half an inch in length. With the European\r\nsalmon, according to Mr. Lloyd,[8] the temporary hook-like structure\r\nserves to strengthen and protect the jaws, when one male charges another\r\nwith wonderful violence; but the greatly developed teeth of the male\r\nAmerican salmon may be compared with the tusks of many male mammals, and\r\nthey indicate an offensive rather than a protective purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Head of female salmon.]\r\n\r\nThe salmon is not the only fish in which the teeth differ in the two\r\nsexes. This is the case with many rays. In the thornback (_Raia\r\nclavata_) the adult male has sharp, pointed teeth, directed backwards,\r\nwhilst those of the female are broad and flat, forming a pavement; so\r\nthat these teeth differ in the two sexes of the same species more than\r\nis usual in distinct genera of the same family. The teeth of the male\r\nbecome sharp only when he is adult: whilst young they are broad and flat\r\nlike those of the female. As so frequently occurs with secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, both sexes of some species of rays, for instance _R. batis_,\r\npossess, when adult, sharp, pointed teeth; and here a character, proper\r\nto and primarily gained by the male, appears to have been transmitted to\r\nthe offspring of both sexes. The teeth are likewise pointed in both\r\nsexes of _R. maculata_, but only when completely adult; the males\r\nacquiring them at an earlier age than the females. We shall hereafter\r\nmeet with analogous cases with certain birds, in which the male acquires\r\nthe plumage common to both adult sexes, at a somewhat earlier age than\r\nthe female. With other species of rays the males even when old never\r\npossess sharp teeth, and consequently both sexes when adult are provided\r\nwith broad, flat teeth like those of the young, and of the mature\r\nfemales of the above-mentioned species.[9] As the rays are bold, strong\r\nand voracious fishes, we may suspect that the males require their sharp\r\nteeth for fighting with their rivals; but as they possess many parts\r\nmodified and adapted for the prehension of the female, it is possible\r\nthat their teeth may be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn regard to size, M. Carbonnier[10] maintains that with almost all\r\nfishes the female is larger than the male; and Dr. Günther does not know\r\nof a single instance in which the male is actually larger than the\r\nfemale. With some Cyprinodonts the male is not even half as large as the\r\nfemale. As with many kinds of fishes the males habitually fight\r\ntogether; it is surprising that they have not generally become through\r\nthe effects of sexual selection larger and stronger than the females.\r\nThe males suffer from their small size, for according to M. Carbonnier\r\nthey are liable to be devoured by the females of their own species when\r\ncarnivorous, and no doubt by other species. Increased size must be in\r\nsome manner of more importance to the females, than strength and size\r\nare to the males for fighting with other males; and this perhaps is to\r\nallow of the production of a vast number of ova.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Callionymus lyra. Upper figure, male; lower\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nIn many species the male alone is ornamented with bright colours; or\r\nthese are much brighter in the male than the female. The male, also, is\r\nsometimes provided with appendages which appear to be of no more use to\r\nhim for the ordinary purposes of life than are the tail-feathers to the\r\npeacock. I am indebted for most of the following facts to the great\r\nkindness of Dr. Günther. There is reason to suspect that many tropical\r\nfishes differ sexually in colour and structure; and there are some\r\nstriking cases with our British fishes. The male _Callionymus lyra_ has\r\nbeen called the _gemmeous dragonet_ “from its brilliant gem-like\r\ncolours.” When freshly taken from the sea the body is yellow of various\r\nshades, striped and spotted with vivid blue on the head; the dorsal fins\r\nare pale brown with dark longitudinal bands; the ventral, caudal and\r\nanal fins being bluish-black. The female, or sordid dragonet, was\r\nconsidered by Linnæus and by many subsequent naturalists as a distinct\r\nspecies; it is of a dingy reddish-brown, with the dorsal fin brown and\r\nthe other fins white. The sexes differ also in the proportional size of\r\nthe head and mouth, and in the position of the eyes;[11] but the most\r\nstriking difference is the extraordinary elongation in the male (fig.\r\n28) of the dorsal fin. The young males resemble in structure and colour\r\nthe adult females. Throughout the genus Callionymus,[12] the male is\r\ngenerally much more brightly spotted than the female, and in several\r\nspecies, not only the dorsal, but the anal fin of the male is much\r\nelongated.\r\n\r\nThe male of the _Cottus scorpius_, or sea-scorpion, is more slender and\r\nsmaller than the female. There is also a great difference in colour\r\nbetween them. It is difficult, as Mr. Lloyd[13] remarks, “for any one,\r\nwho has not seen this fish during the spawning-season, when its hues are\r\nbrightest, to conceive the admixture of brilliant colours with which it,\r\nin other respects so ill-favoured, is at that time adorned.” Both sexes\r\nof the _Labrus mixtus_, although very different in colour, are\r\nbeautiful; the male being orange with bright-blue stripes, and the\r\nfemale bright-red with some black spots on the back.\r\n\r\nIn the very distinct family of the Cyprinodontidæ—inhabitants of the\r\nfresh waters of foreign lands—the sexes sometimes differ much in\r\nvarious characters. In the male of the _Mollienesia petenensis_,[14] the\r\ndorsal fin is greatly developed and is marked with a row of large,\r\nround, ocellated, bright-coloured spots; whilst the same fin in the\r\nfemale is smaller, of a different shape, and marked only with\r\nirregularly-curved brown spots. In the male the basal margin of the anal\r\nfin is also a little produced and dark-coloured. In the male of an\r\nallied form, the _Xiphophorus Hellerii_ (fig. 29), the inferior margin\r\nof the anal fin is developed into a long filament, which is striped, as\r\nI hear from Dr. Günther, with bright colours. This filament does not\r\ncontain any muscles, and apparently cannot be of any direct use to the\r\nfish. As in the case of the Callionymus, the males whilst young resemble\r\nin colour and structure the adult females. Sexual differences such as\r\nthese may be strictly compared with those which are so frequent with\r\ngallinaceous birds.[15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Xiphophorus Hellerii. Upper figure, male; lower\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nIn a siluroid fish, inhabiting the fresh waters of South America, namely\r\nthe _Plecostomus barbatus_[16] (fig. 30), the male has its mouth and\r\ninteroperculum fringed with a beard of stiff hairs, of which the female\r\nshews hardly a trace. These hairs are of the nature of scales. In\r\nanother species of the same genus, soft flexible tentacles project from\r\nthe front part of the head of the male, which are absent in the\r\nfemale. These tentacles are prolongations of the true skin, and\r\ntherefore are not homologous with the stiff hairs of the former species;\r\nbut it can hardly be doubted that both serve the same purpose. What this\r\npurpose may be it is difficult to conjecture; ornament does not here\r\nseem probable, but we can hardly suppose that stiff hairs and flexible\r\nfilaments can be useful in any ordinary way to the males alone. The\r\n_Monacanthus scopas_, which was shewn to me in the British Museum by Dr.\r\nGünther, presents a nearly analogous case. The male has a cluster of\r\nstiff, straight spines, like those of a comb, on the sides of the tail;\r\nand these in a specimen six inches long were nearly an inch and a half\r\nin length; the female has on the same place a cluster of bristles, which\r\nmay be compared with those of a tooth-brush. In another species, the _M.\r\nperonii_, the male has a brush like that possessed by the female of the\r\nlast species, whilst the sides of the tail in the female are smooth. In\r\nsome other species the same part of the tail can be perceived to be a\r\nlittle roughened in the male and perfectly smooth in the female; and\r\nlastly in others, both sexes have smooth sides. In that strange monster,\r\nthe _Chimæra monstrosa_, the male has a hook-shaped bone on the top of\r\nthe head, directed forwards, with its rounded end covered with sharp\r\nspines; in the female “this crown is altogether absent,” but what its\r\nuse may be is utterly unknown.[17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.

Upper figure, head of\r\nmale; lower figure, female.]\r\n\r\nThe structures as yet referred to are permanent in the male after he has\r\narrived at maturity; but with some Blennies and in another allied\r\ngenus[18] a crest is developed on the head of the male only during the\r\nbreeding-season, and their bodies at the same time become more\r\nbrightly-coloured. There can be little doubt that this crest serves as a\r\ntemporary sexual ornament, for the female does not exhibit a trace of\r\nit. In other species of the same genus both sexes possess a crest, and\r\nin at least one species neither sex is thus provided. In this case and\r\nin that of the Monacanthus, we have good instances to how great an\r\nextent the sexual characters of closely-allied forms may differ. In many\r\nof the Chromidæ, for instance in Geophagus and especially in Cichla, the\r\nmales, as I hear from Professor Agassiz,[19] have a conspicuous\r\nprotuberance on the forehead, which is wholly wanting in the females and\r\nin the young males. Professor Agassiz adds, “I have often observed these\r\nfishes at the time of spawning when the protuberance is largest, and at\r\nother seasons when it is totally wanting and the two sexes shew no\r\ndifference whatever in the outline of the profile of the head. I never\r\ncould ascertain that it subserves any special function, and the Indians\r\non the Amazon know nothing about its use.” These protuberances in their\r\nperiodical appearance resemble the fleshy caruncles on the heads of\r\ncertain birds; but whether they serve as ornaments must remain at\r\npresent doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe males of those fishes, which differ permanently in colour from the\r\nfemales, often become more brilliant, as I hear from Professor Agassiz\r\nand Dr. Günther, during the breeding-season. This is likewise the case\r\nwith a multitude of fishes, the sexes of which at all other seasons of\r\nthe year are identical in colour. The tench, roach, and perch may be\r\ngiven as instances. The male salmon at this season is “marked on the\r\ncheeks with orange-coloured stripes, which give it the appearance of a\r\nLabrus, and the body partakes of a golden-orange tinge. The females are\r\ndark in colour, and are commonly called black-fish.”[20] An analogous\r\nand even greater change takes place with the _Salmo eriox_ or\r\nbull-trout; the males of the char (_S. umbla_) are likewise at this\r\nseason rather brighter in colour than the females.[21] The colours of\r\nthe pike (_Esox reticulatus_) of the United States, especially of the\r\nmale, become, during the breeding-season, exceedingly intense,\r\nbrilliant, and iridescent.[22] Another striking instance out of many is\r\nafforded by the male stickleback (_Gasterosteus leiurus_), which is\r\ndescribed by Mr. Warington,[23] as being then “beautiful beyond\r\ndescription.” The back and eyes of the female are simply brown, and the\r\nbelly white. The eyes of the male, on the other hand, are “of the most\r\nsplendid green, having a metallic lustre like the green feathers of some\r\nhumming-birds. The throat and belly are of a bright crimson, the back of\r\nan ashy-green, and the whole fish appears as though it were somewhat\r\ntranslucent and glowed with an internal incandescence.” After the\r\nbreeding-season these colours all change, the throat and belly become of\r\na paler red, the back more green, and the glowing tints subside.\r\n\r\nThat with fishes there exists some close relation between their colours\r\nand their sexual functions we can clearly see;—firstly, from the adult\r\nmales of certain species being differently coloured from the females,\r\nand often much more brilliantly;—secondly, from these same males,\r\nwhilst immature, resembling the mature females;—and, lastly, from the\r\nmales, even of those species which at all other times of the year are\r\nidentical in colour with the females, often acquiring brilliant tints\r\nduring the spawning-season. We know that the males are ardent in their\r\ncourtship and sometimes fight desperately together. If we may assume\r\nthat the females have the power of exerting a choice and of selecting\r\nthe more highly-ornamented males, all the above facts become\r\nintelligible through the principle of sexual selection. On the other\r\nhand, if the females habitually deposited and left their ova to be\r\nfertilised by the first male which chanced to approach, this fact would\r\nbe fatal to the efficiency of sexual selection; for there could be no\r\nchoice of a partner. But, as far as is known, the female never willingly\r\nspawns except in the close presence of a male, and the male never\r\nfertilises the ova except in the close presence of a female. It is\r\nobviously difficult to obtain direct evidence with respect to female\r\nfishes selecting their partners. An excellent observer,[24] who\r\ncarefully watched the spawning of minnows (_Cyprinus phoxinus_), remarks\r\nthat owing to the males, which were ten times as numerous as the\r\nfemales, crowding closely round them, he could “speak only doubtfully on\r\ntheir operations. When a female came among a number of males they\r\nimmediately pursued her; if she was not ready for shedding her spawn,\r\nshe made a precipitate retreat; but if she was ready, she came boldly in\r\namong them, and was immediately pressed closely by a male on each side;\r\nand when they had been in that situation a short time, were superseded\r\nby other two, who wedged themselves in between them and the female, who\r\nappeared to treat all her lovers with the same kindness.”\r\nNotwithstanding this last statement, I cannot, from the several previous\r\nconsiderations, give up the belief that the males which are the most\r\nattractive to the females, from their brighter colours or other\r\nornaments, are commonly preferred by them; and that the males have thus\r\nbeen rendered more beautiful in the course of ages.\r\n\r\nWe have next to inquire whether this view can be extended, through the\r\nlaw of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes, to those\r\ngroups in which the males and females are brilliant in the same or\r\nnearly the same degree and manner. In such a genus as Labrus, which\r\nincludes some of the most splendid fishes in the world, for instance,\r\nthe Peacock Labrus (_L. pavo_), described,[25] with pardonable\r\nexaggeration, as formed of polished scales of gold encrusting\r\nlapis-lazuli, rubies, sapphires, emeralds and amethysts, we may, with\r\nmuch probability, accept this belief; for we have seen that the sexes in\r\nat least one species differ greatly in colour. With some fishes, as with\r\nmany of the lowest animals, splendid colours may be the direct result of\r\nthe nature of their tissues and of the surrounding conditions, without\r\nany aid from selection. The goldfish (_Cyprinus auratus_), judging from\r\nthe analogy of the golden variety of the common carp, is, perhaps, a\r\ncase in point, as it may owe its splendid colours to a single abrupt\r\nvariation, due to the conditions to which this fish has been subjected\r\nunder confinement. It is, however, more probable that these colours have\r\nbeen intensified through artificial selection, as this species has been\r\ncarefully bred in China from a remote period.[26] Under natural\r\nconditions it does not seem probable that beings so highly organised as\r\nfishes, and which live under such complex relations, should become\r\nbrilliantly coloured without suffering some evil or receiving some\r\nbenefit from so great a change, and consequently without the\r\nintervention of natural selection.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, must we conclude in regard to the many fishes, both sexes of\r\nwhich are splendidly coloured? Mr. Wallace[27] believes that the species\r\nwhich frequent reefs, where corals and other brightly-coloured organisms\r\nabound, are brightly coloured in order to escape detection by their\r\nenemies; but according to my recollection they were thus rendered highly\r\nconspicuous. In the fresh-waters of the Tropics there are no\r\nbrilliantly-coloured corals or other organisms for the fishes to\r\nresemble; yet many species in the Amazons are beautifully coloured, and\r\nmany of the carnivorous Cyprinidæ in India are ornamented with “bright\r\nlongitudinal lines of various tints.”[28] Mr. M’Clelland, in describing\r\nthese fishes goes so far as to suppose that “the peculiar brilliancy of\r\ntheir colours” serves as “a better mark for kingfishers, terns, and\r\nother birds which are destined to keep the number of these fishes in\r\ncheck;” but at the present day few naturalists will admit that any\r\nanimal has been made conspicuous as an aid to its own destruction. It is\r\npossible that certain fishes may have been rendered conspicuous in order\r\nto warn birds and beasts of prey (as explained when treating of\r\ncaterpillars) that they were unpalatable; but it is not, I believe,\r\nknown that any fish, at least any freshwater fish, is rejected from\r\nbeing distasteful to fish-devouring animals. On the whole, the most\r\nprobable view in regard to the fishes, of which both sexes are\r\nbrilliantly coloured, is that their colours have been acquired by the\r\nmales as a sexual ornament, and have been transferred in an equal or\r\nnearly equal degree to the other sex.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider whether, when the male differs in a marked\r\nmanner from the female in colour or in other ornaments, he alone has\r\nbeen modified, with the variations inherited only by his male offspring;\r\nor whether the female has been specially modified and rendered\r\ninconspicuous for the sake of protection, such modifications being\r\ninherited only by the females. It is impossible to doubt that colour has\r\nbeen acquired by many fishes as a protection: no one can behold the\r\nspeckled upper surface of a flounder, and overlook its resemblance to\r\nthe sandy bed of the sea on which it lives. One of the most striking\r\ninstances ever recorded of an animal gaining protection by its colour\r\n(as far as can be judged in preserved specimens) and by its form, is\r\nthat given by Dr. Günther[29] of a pipe-fish, which, with its reddish\r\nstreaming filaments, is hardly distinguishable from the sea-weed to\r\nwhich it clings with its prehensile tail. But the question now under\r\nconsideration is whether the females alone have been modified for this\r\nobject. Fishes offer valuable evidence on this head. We can see that\r\none sex will not be modified through natural selection for the sake of\r\nprotection more than the other, supposing both to vary, unless one sex\r\nis exposed for a longer period to danger, or has less power of escaping\r\nfrom such danger than the other sex; and it does not appear that with\r\nfishes the sexes differ in these respects. As far as there is any\r\ndifference, the males, from being generally of smaller size, and from\r\nwandering more about, are exposed to greater danger than the females;\r\nand yet, when the sexes differ, the males are almost always the most\r\nconspicuously coloured. The ova are fertilised immediately after being\r\ndeposited, and when this process lasts for several days, as in the case\r\nof the salmon,[30] the female, during the whole time, is attended by the\r\nmale. After the ova are fertilised they are, in most cases, left\r\nunprotected by both parents, so that the males and females, as far as\r\noviposition is concerned, are equally exposed to danger, and both are\r\nequally important for the production of fertile ova; consequently the\r\nmore or less brightly-coloured individuals of either sex would be\r\nequally liable to be destroyed or preserved, and both would have an\r\nequal influence on the colours of their offspring or the race.\r\n\r\nCertain fishes, belonging to several families, make nests; and some of\r\nthese fishes take care of their young when hatched. Both sexes of the\r\nbrightly-coloured _Crenilabrus massa_ and _melops_ work together in\r\nbuilding their nests with sea-weed, shells, &c.[31] But the males of\r\ncertain fishes do all the work, and afterwards take exclusive charge of\r\nthe young. This is the case with the dull-coloured gobies,[32] in which\r\nthe sexes are not known to differ in colour, and likewise with the\r\nsticklebacks (Gasterosteus), in which the males become brilliantly\r\ncoloured during the spawning-season. The male of the smooth-tailed\r\nstickleback (_G. leiurus_) performs during a long time the duties of a\r\nnurse with exemplary care and vigilance, and is continually employed in\r\ngently leading back the young to the nest when they stray too far. He\r\ncourageously drives away all enemies, including the females of his own\r\nspecies. It would indeed be no small relief to the male if the female,\r\nafter depositing her eggs, were immediately devoured by some enemy, for\r\nhe is forced incessantly to drive her from the nest.[33]\r\n\r\nThe males of certain other fishes inhabiting South America and Ceylon,\r\nand belonging to two distinct orders, have the extraordinary habit of\r\nhatching the eggs laid by the females within their mouths or branchial\r\ncavities.[34] With the Amazonian species which follow this habit, the\r\nmales, as I am informed by the kindness of Professor Agassiz, “not only\r\nare generally brighter than the females, but the difference is greater\r\nat the spawning-season than at any other time.” The species of Geophagus\r\nact in the same manner; and in this genus, a conspicuous protuberance\r\nbecomes developed on the forehead of the males during the\r\nbreeding-season. With the various species of Chromids, as Professor\r\nAgassiz likewise informs me, sexual differences in colour may be\r\nobserved, “whether they lay their eggs in the water among aquatic\r\nplants, or deposit them in holes, leaving them to come out without\r\nfurther care, or build shallow nests in the river-mud, over which they\r\nsit, as our Promotis does. It ought also to be observed that these\r\nsitters are among the brightest species in their respective families;\r\nfor instance, Hygrogonus is bright green, with large black ocelli,\r\nencircled with the most brilliant red.” Whether with all the species of\r\nChromids it is the male alone which sits on the eggs is not known. It\r\nis, however, manifest that the fact of the eggs being protected or\r\nunprotected, has had little or no influence on the differences in colour\r\nbetween the sexes. It is further manifest, in all the cases in which the\r\nmales take exclusive charge of the nests and young, that the destruction\r\nof the brighter-coloured males would be far more influential on the\r\ncharacter of the race, than the destruction of the brighter-coloured\r\nfemales; for the death of the male during the period of incubation or\r\nnursing would entail the death of the young, so that these could not\r\ninherit his peculiarities; yet, in many of these very cases the males\r\nare more conspicuously coloured than the females.\r\n\r\nIn most of the Lophobranchii (Pipe-fish, Hippocampi, &c.) the males have\r\neither marsupial sacks or hemispherical depressions on the abdomen, in\r\nwhich the ova laid by the female are hatched. The males also shew great\r\nattachment to their young.[35] The sexes do not commonly differ much in\r\ncolour; but Dr. Günther believes that the male Hippocampi are rather\r\nbrighter than the females. The genus Solenostoma, however, offers a\r\nvery curious exceptional case,[36] for the female is much more vividly\r\ncoloured and spotted than the male, and she alone has a marsupial sack\r\nand hatches the eggs; so that the female of Solenostoma differs from all\r\nthe other Lophobranchii in this latter respect, and from almost all\r\nother fishes, in being more brightly coloured than the male. It is\r\nimprobable that this remarkable double inversion of character in the\r\nfemale should be an accidental coincidence. As the males of several\r\nfishes which take exclusive charge of the eggs and young are more\r\nbrightly coloured than the females, and as here the female Solenostoma\r\ntakes the same charge and is brighter than the male, it might be argued\r\nthat the conspicuous colours of the sex which is the most important of\r\nthe two for the welfare of the offspring must serve, in some manner, as\r\na protection. But from the multitude of fishes, the males of which are\r\neither permanently or periodically brighter than the females, but whose\r\nlife is not at all more important than that of the female for the\r\nwelfare of the species, this view can hardly be maintained. When we\r\ntreat of birds we shall meet with analogous cases in which there has\r\nbeen a complete inversion of the usual attributes of the two sexes, and\r\nwe shall then give what appears to be the probable explanation, namely,\r\nthat the males have selected the more attractive females, instead of the\r\nlatter having selected, in accordance with the usual rule throughout the\r\nanimal kingdom, the more attractive males.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we may conclude, that with most fishes, in which the sexes\r\ndiffer in colour or in other ornamental characters, the males\r\noriginally varied, with their variations transmitted to the same sex,\r\nand accumulated through sexual selection by attracting or exciting the\r\nfemales. In many cases, however, such characters have been transferred,\r\neither partially or completely, to the females. In other cases, again,\r\nboth sexes have been coloured alike for the sake of protection; but in\r\nno instance does it appear that the female alone has had her colours or\r\nother characters specially modified for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe last point which need be noticed is that in many parts of the world\r\nfishes are known to make peculiar noises, which are described in some\r\ncases as being musical. Very little has been ascertained with respect to\r\nthe means by which such sounds are produced, and even less about their\r\npurpose. The drumming of the Umbrinas in the European seas is said to be\r\naudible from a depth of twenty fathoms. The fishermen of Rochelle assert\r\n“that the males alone make the noise during the spawning-time; and that\r\nit is possible by imitating it, to take them without bait.”[37] If this\r\nstatement is trustworthy, we have an instance in this, the lowest class\r\nof the Vertebrata, of what we shall find prevailing throughout the other\r\nvertebrate classes, and which prevails, as we have already seen, with\r\ninsects and spiders; namely, that vocal and instrumental sounds so\r\ncommonly serve as a love-call or as a love-charm, that the power of\r\nproducing them was probably first developed in connection with the\r\npropagation of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIANS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Triton cristatus (half natural size, from Bell’s\r\n‘British Reptiles’). Upper figure, male during the breeding-season;\r\nlower figure, female.]\r\n\r\n_Urodela._—First for the tailed amphibians. The sexes of salamanders or\r\nnewts often differ much both in colour and structure. In some species\r\nprehensile claws are developed on the forelegs of the males during the\r\nbreeding-season; and at this season in the male _Triton palmipes_ the\r\nhind-feet are provided with a swimming web, which is almost completely\r\nabsorbed during the winter; so that their feet then resemble those of\r\nthe female.[38] This structure no doubt aids the male in his eager\r\nsearch and pursuit of the female. With our common newts (_Triton\r\npunctatus_ and _cristatus_) a deep, much-indented crest is developed\r\nalong the back and tail of the male during the breeding-season, being\r\nabsorbed during the winter. It is not furnished, as Mr. St. George\r\nMivart informs me, with muscles, and therefore cannot be used for\r\nlocomotion. As during the season of courtship it becomes edged with\r\nbright colours, it serves, there can hardly be a doubt, as a masculine\r\nornament. In many species the body presents strongly contrasted, though\r\nlurid tints; and these become more vivid during the breeding-season. The\r\nmale, for instance, of our common little newt (_Triton punctatus_) is\r\n“brownish-grey above, passing into yellow beneath, which in the spring\r\nbecomes a rich bright orange, marked everywhere with round dark spots.”\r\nThe edge of the crest also is then tipped with bright red or violet. The\r\nfemale is usually of a yellowish-brown colour with scattered brown dots;\r\nand the lower surface is often quite plain.[39] The young are obscurely\r\ntinted. The ova are fertilised during the act of deposition and are not\r\nsubsequently tended by either parent. We may therefore conclude that the\r\nmales acquired their strongly-marked colours and ornamental appendages\r\nthrough sexual selection; these being transmitted either to the male\r\noffspring alone or to both sexes.\r\n\r\n_Anura_ or _Batrachia_.—With many frogs and toads the colours evidently\r\nserve as a protection, such as the bright green tints of tree-frogs and\r\nthe obscure mottled shades of many terrestrial species. The most\r\nconspicuously coloured toad which I ever saw, namely the _Phryniscus\r\nnigricans_[40] had the whole upper surface of the body as black as ink,\r\nwith the soles of the feet and parts of the abdomen spotted with the\r\nbrightest vermilion. It crawled about the bare sandy or open grassy\r\nplains of La Plata under a scorching sun, and could not fail to catch\r\nthe eye of every passing creature. These colours may be beneficial by\r\nmaking this toad known to all birds of prey as a nauseous mouthful; for\r\nit is familiar to every one that these animals emit a poisonous\r\nsecretion, which causes the mouth of a dog to froth, as if attacked by\r\nhydrophobia. I was the more struck with the conspicuous colours of this\r\ntoad, as close by I found a lizard (_Proctotretus multimaculatus_)\r\nwhich, when frightened, flattened its body, closed its eyes, and then\r\nfrom its mottled tints could hardly be distinguishable from the\r\nsurrounding sand.\r\n\r\nWith respect to sexual differences of colour, Dr. Günther knows of no\r\nstriking instance with frogs or toads; yet he can often distinguish the\r\nmale from the female, by the tints of the former being a little more\r\nintense. Nor does Dr. Günther know of any striking difference in\r\nexternal structure between the sexes, excepting the prominences which\r\nbecome developed during the breeding-season on the front-legs of the\r\nmale, by which he is enabled to hold the female. The _Megalophrys\r\nmontana_[41] (fig. 32) offers the best case of a certain amount of\r\nstructural difference between the sexes; for in the male the tip of the\r\nnose and the eyelids are produced into triangular flaps of skin, and\r\nthere is a little black tubercle on the back—characters which are\r\nabsent, or only feebly developed, in the females. It is surprising that\r\nfrogs and toads should not have acquired more strongly-marked sexual\r\ndifferences; for though cold-blooded, their passions are strong. Dr.\r\nGünther informs me that he has several times found an unfortunate female\r\ntoad dead and smothered from having been so closely embraced by three or\r\nfour males.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Megalophrys montana. The two left-hand figures,\r\nthe male; the two right-hand figures, the female.]\r\n\r\nThese animals, however, offer one interesting sexual difference, namely\r\nin the musical powers possessed by the males; but to speak of music,\r\nwhen applied to the discordant and overwhelming sounds emitted by male\r\nbull-frogs and some other species, seems, according to our taste, a\r\nsingularly inappropriate expression. Nevertheless certain frogs sing in\r\na decidedly pleasing manner. Near Rio de Janeiro I used often to sit in\r\nthe evening to listen to a number of little Hylæ, which, perched on\r\nblades of grass close to the water, sent forth sweet chirping notes in\r\nharmony. The various sounds are emitted chiefly by the males during the\r\nbreeding-season, as in the case of the croaking of our common frog.[42]\r\nIn accordance with this fact the vocal organs of the males are more\r\nhighly developed than those of the females. In some genera the males\r\nalone are provided with sacs which open into the larynx.[43] For\r\ninstance, in the edible frog (_Rana esculenta_) “the sacs are peculiar\r\nto the males, and become, when filled with air in the act of croaking,\r\nlarge globular bladders, standing out one on each side of the head, near\r\nthe corners of the mouth.” The croak of the male is thus rendered\r\nexceedingly powerful; whilst that of the female is only a slight\r\ngroaning noise.[44] The vocal organs differ considerably in structure in\r\nthe several genera of the family; and their development in all cases may\r\nbe attributed to sexual selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPTILES.\r\n\r\n_Chelonia._—Tortoises and turtles do not offer well-marked sexual\r\ndifferences. In some species, the tail of the male is longer than that\r\nof the female. In some, the plastron or lower surface of the shell of\r\nthe male is slightly concave in relation to the back of the female. The\r\nmale of the mud-turtle of the United States (_Chrysemys picta_) has\r\nclaws on its front-feet twice as long as those of the female; and these\r\nare used when the sexes unite.[45] With the huge tortoise of the\r\nGalapagos Islands (_Testudo nigra_) the males are said to grow to a\r\nlarger size than the females: during the pairing-season, and at no other\r\ntime, the male utters a hoarse, bellowing noise, which can be heard at\r\nthe distance of more than a hundred yards; the female, on the other\r\nhand, never uses her voice.[46]\r\n\r\n_Crocodilia._—The sexes apparently do not differ in colour; nor do I\r\nknow that the males fight together, though this is probable, for some\r\nkinds make a prodigious display before the females. Bartram[47]\r\ndescribes the male alligator as striving to win the female by splashing\r\nand roaring in the midst of a lagoon, “swollen to an extent ready to\r\nburst, with his head and tail lifted up, he spins or twirls round on the\r\nsurface of the water, like an Indian chief rehearsing his feats of war.”\r\nDuring the season of love, a musky odour is emitted by the submaxillary\r\nglands of the crocodile, and pervades their haunts.[48]\r\n\r\n_Ophidia._—I have little to say about Snakes. Dr. Günther informs me\r\nthat the males are always smaller than the females, and generally have\r\nlonger and slenderer tails; but he knows of no other difference in\r\nexternal structure. In regard to colour, Dr. Günther can almost always\r\ndistinguish the male from the female by his more strongly-pronounced\r\ntints; thus the black zigzag band on the back of the male English viper\r\nis more distinctly defined than in the female. The difference is much\r\nplainer in the Rattle-snakes of N. America, the male of which, as the\r\nkeeper in the Zoological Gardens shewed me, can instantly be\r\ndistinguished from the female by having more lurid yellow about its\r\nwhole body. In S. Africa the _Bucephalus capensis_ presents an analogous\r\ndifference, for the female “is never so fully variegated with yellow on\r\nthe sides, as the male.”[49] The male of the Indian _Dipsas cynodon_, on\r\nthe other hand, is blackish-brown, with the belly partly black, whilst\r\nthe female is reddish or yellowish-olive with the belly either uniform\r\nyellowish or marbled with black.\r\n\r\nIn the _Tragops dispar_ of the same country, the male is bright green,\r\nand the female bronze-coloured.[50] No doubt the colours of some snakes\r\nserve as a protection, as the green tints of tree-snakes and the various\r\nmottled shades of the species which live in sandy places; but it is\r\ndoubtful whether the colours of many kinds, for instance of the common\r\nEnglish snake or viper, serve to conceal them; and this is still more\r\ndoubtful with the many foreign species which are coloured with extreme\r\nelegance.\r\n\r\nDuring the breeding-season their anal scent-glands are in active\r\nfunction;[51] and so it is with the same glands in lizards, and as we\r\nhave seen with the submaxillary glands of crocodiles. As the males of\r\nmost animals search for the females, these odoriferous glands probably\r\nserve to excite or charm the female, rather than to guide her to the\r\nspot where the male may be found.[52] Male snakes, though appearing so\r\nsluggish, are amorous; for many have been observed crowding round the\r\nsame female, and even round the dead body of a female. They are not\r\nknown to fight together from rivalry. Their intellectual powers are\r\nhigher than might have been anticipated. An excellent observer in\r\nCeylon, Mr. E. Layard,[53] saw a Cobra thrust its head through a narrow\r\nhole and swallow a toad. “With this incumbrance he could not withdraw\r\nhimself; finding this, he reluctantly disgorged the precious morsel,\r\nwhich began to move off; this was too much for snake philosophy to bear,\r\nand the toad was again seized, and again was the snake, after violent\r\nefforts to escape, compelled to part with its prey. This time, however,\r\na lesson had been learnt, and the toad was seized by one leg, withdrawn,\r\nand then swallowed in triumph.”\r\n\r\nIt does not, however, follow because snakes have some reasoning power\r\nand strong passions, that they should likewise be endowed with\r\nsufficient taste to admire brilliant colours in their partners, so as to\r\nlead to the adornment of the species through sexual selection.\r\nNevertheless it is difficult to account in any other manner for the\r\nextreme beauty of certain species; for instance, of the coral-snakes of\r\nS. America, which are of a rich red with black and yellow transverse\r\nbands. I well remember how much surprise I felt at the beauty of the\r\nfirst coral-snake which I saw gliding across a path in Brazil. Snakes\r\ncoloured in this peculiar manner, as Mr. Wallace states on the authority\r\nof Dr. Günther,[54] are found nowhere else in the world except in S.\r\nAmerica, and here no less than four genera occur. One of these, Elaps,\r\nis venomous; a second and widely-distinct genus is doubtfully venomous,\r\nand the two others are quite harmless. The species belonging to these\r\ndistinct genera inhabit the same districts, and are so like each other,\r\nthat no one “but a naturalist would distinguish the harmless from the\r\npoisonous kinds.” Hence, as Mr. Wallace believes, the innocuous kinds\r\nhave probably acquired their colours as a protection, on the principle\r\nof imitation; for they would naturally be thought dangerous by their\r\nenemies. The cause, however, of the bright colours of the venomous Elaps\r\nremains to be explained, and this may perhaps be sexual selection.\r\n\r\n_Lacertilia._—The males of some, probably of many kinds of lizards\r\nfight together from rivalry. Thus the arboreal _Anolis cristatellus_ of\r\nS. America is extremely pugnacious: “During the spring and early part of\r\nthe summer, two adult males rarely meet without a contest. On first\r\nseeing one another, they nod their heads up and down three or four\r\ntimes, at the same time expanding the frill or pouch beneath the throat;\r\ntheir eyes glisten with rage, and after waving their tails from side to\r\nside for a few seconds, as if to gather energy, they dart at each other\r\nfuriously, rolling over and over, and holding firmly with their teeth.\r\nThe conflict generally ends in one of the combatants losing his tail,\r\nwhich is often devoured by the victor.” The male of this species is\r\nconsiderably larger than the female;[55] and this, as far as Dr. Günther\r\nhas been able to ascertain, is the general rule with lizards of all\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nThe sexes often differ greatly in various external characters. The male\r\nof the above-mentioned Anolis is furnished with a crest, which runs\r\nalong the back and tail, and can be erected at pleasure; but of this\r\ncrest the female does not exhibit a trace. In the Indian _Cophotis\r\nceylanica_, the female possesses a dorsal crest, though much less\r\ndeveloped than in the male; and so it is, as Dr. Günther informs me,\r\nwith the females of many Iguanas, Chameleons and other lizards. In some\r\nspecies, however, the crest is equally developed in both sexes, as in\r\nthe _Iguana tuberculata_. In the genus Sitana, the males alone are\r\nfurnished with a large throat-pouch (fig. 33), which can be folded up\r\nlike a fan, and is coloured blue, black, and red; but these splendid\r\ncolours are exhibited only during the pairing-season. The female does\r\nnot possess even a rudiment of this appendage. In the _Anolis\r\ncristatellus_, according to Mr. Austen, the throat-pouch, which is\r\nbright red marbled with yellow, is present, though in a rudimental\r\ncondition, in the female. Again, in certain other lizards, both sexes\r\nare equally well provided with throat-pouches. Here, as in so many\r\nprevious cases, we see with species belonging to the same group, the\r\nsame character confined to the males, or more largely developed in the\r\nmales than in the females, or equally developed in both sexes. The\r\nlittle lizards of the genus Draco, which glide through the air on their\r\nrib-supported parachutes, and which in the beauty of their colours\r\nbaffle description, are furnished with skinny appendages to the throat,\r\n“like the wattles of gallinaceous birds.” These become erected when the\r\nanimal is excited. They occur in both sexes, but are best developed in\r\nthe male when arrived at maturity, at which age the middle appendage is\r\nsometimes twice as long as the head. Most of the species likewise have a\r\nlow crest running along the neck; and this is much more developed in the\r\nfull-grown males, than in the females or young males.[56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Sitana minor. Male, with the gular pouch\r\nexpanded (from Günther’s ‘Reptiles of India’).]\r\n\r\nThere are other and much more remarkable differences between the sexes\r\nof certain lizards. The male of _Ceratophora aspera_ bears on the\r\nextremity of his snout an appendage half as long as the head. It is\r\ncylindrical, covered with scales, flexible, and apparently capable of\r\nerection: in the female it is quite rudimental. In a second species of\r\nthe same genus a terminal scale forms a minute horn on the summit of the\r\nflexible appendage; and in a third species (_C. Stoddartii_, fig. 34)\r\nthe whole appendage is converted into a horn, which is usually of a\r\nwhite colour, but assumes a purplish tint when the animal is excited. In\r\nthe adult male of this latter species the horn is half an inch in\r\nlength, but is of quite minute size in the female and in the young.\r\nThese appendages, as Dr. Günther has remarked to me, may be compared\r\nwith the combs of gallinaceous birds, and apparently serve as ornaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. Ceratophora Stoddartii. Upper figure, male;\r\nlower figure, female.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Chamæleon bifurcus. Upper figure, male; lower\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nIn the genus Chamæleon we come to the climax of difference between the\r\nsexes. The upper part of the skull of the male _C. bifurcus_ (fig. 35),\r\nan inhabitant of Madagascar, is produced into two great, solid, bony\r\nprojections, covered with scales like the rest of the head; and of this\r\nwonderful modification of structure the female exhibits only a rudiment.\r\nAgain, in _Chamæleon Owenii_ (fig. 36), from the West Coast of Africa,\r\nthe male bears on his snout and forehead three curious horns, of which\r\nthe female has not a trace. These horns consist of an excrescence of\r\nbone covered with a smooth sheath, forming part of the general\r\ninteguments of the body, so that they are identical in structure with\r\nthose of a bull, goat, or other sheath-horned ruminant. Although the\r\nthree horns differ so much in appearance from the two great\r\nprolongations of the skull in _C. bifurcus_, we can hardly doubt that\r\nthey serve the same general purpose in the economy of these two animals.\r\nThe first conjecture which will occur to every one is that they are\r\nused by the males for fighting together; but Dr. Günther, to whom I am\r\nindebted for the foregoing details, does not believe that such peaceable\r\ncreatures would ever become pugnacious. Hence we are driven to infer\r\nthat these almost monstrous deviations of structure serve as masculine\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. Chamæleon Owenii. Upper figure, male; lower\r\nfigure, female.]\r\n\r\nWith many kinds of lizards, the sexes differ slightly in colour, the\r\ntints and stripes of the males being brighter and more distinctly\r\ndefined than in the females. This, for instance, is the case with the\r\npreviously-mentioned Cophotis and with the _Acanthodactylus capensis_ of\r\nS. Africa. In a Cordylus of the latter country, the male is either much\r\nredder or greener than the female. In the Indian _Calotes nigrilabris_\r\nthere is a greater difference in colour between the sexes; the lips also\r\nof the male are black, whilst those of the female are green. In our\r\ncommon little viviparous lizard (_Zootoca vivipara_) “the under side of\r\nthe body and base of the tail in the male are bright orange, spotted\r\nwith black; in the female these parts are pale greyish-green without\r\nspots.”[57] We have seen that the males alone of Sitana possess a\r\nthroat-pouch; and this is splendidly tinted with blue, black, and red.\r\nIn the _Proctotretus tenuis_ of Chile the male alone is marked with\r\nspots of blue, green, and coppery-red.[58] I collected in S. America\r\nfourteen species of this genus, and though I neglected to record the\r\nsexes, I observed that certain individuals alone were marked with\r\nemerald-like green spots, whilst others had orange-coloured gorges; and\r\nthese in both cases no doubt were the males.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing species, the males are more brightly coloured than the\r\nfemales, but with many lizards both sexes are coloured in the same\r\nelegant or even magnificent manner; and there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat such conspicuous colours are protective. With some lizards,\r\nhowever, the green tints no doubt serve for concealment; and an instance\r\nhas already been incidently given of one species of Proctotretus which\r\nclosely resembles the sand on which it lives. On the whole we may\r\nconclude with tolerable safety that the beautiful colours of many\r\nlizards, as well as various appendages and other strange modifications\r\nof structure, have been gained by the males through sexual selection for\r\nthe sake of ornament, and have been transmitted either to their male\r\noffspring alone or to both sexes. Sexual selection, indeed, seems to\r\nhave played almost as important a part with reptiles as with birds. But\r\nthe less conspicuous colours of the females in comparison with those of\r\nthe males cannot be accounted for, as Mr. Wallace believes to be the\r\ncase with birds, by the exposure of the females to danger during\r\nincubation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Sexual differences—Law of battle—Special weapons—Vocal\r\n   organs—Instrumental music—Love-antics and\r\n   dances—Decorations, permanent and seasonal—Double and single\r\n   annual moults—Display of ornaments by the males.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary sexual characters are more diversified and conspicuous in\r\nbirds, though not perhaps entailing more important changes of structure,\r\nthan in any other class of animals. I shall, therefore, treat the\r\nsubject at considerable length. Male birds sometimes, though rarely,\r\npossess special weapons for fighting with each other. They charm the\r\nfemales by vocal or instrumental music of the most varied kinds. They\r\nare ornamented by all sorts of combs, wattles, protuberances, horns,\r\nair-distended sacs, top-knots, naked shafts, plumes and lengthened\r\nfeathers gracefully springing from all parts of the body. The beak and\r\nnaked skin about the head, and the feathers are often gorgeously\r\ncoloured. The males sometimes pay their court by dancing, or by\r\nfantastic antics performed either on the ground or in the air. In one\r\ninstance, at least, the male emits a musky odour which we may suppose\r\nserves to charm or excite the female; for that excellent observer, Mr.\r\nRamsay,[59] says of the Australian musk-duck (_Biziura lobata_) that\r\n“the smell which the male emits during the summer months is confined to\r\nthat sex, and in some individuals is retained throughout the year; I\r\nhave never even in the breeding-season, shot a female which had any\r\nsmell of musk.” So powerful is this odour during the pairing-season,\r\nthat it can be detected long before the bird can be seen.[60] On the\r\nwhole, birds appear to be the most æsthetic of all animals, excepting of\r\ncourse man, and they have nearly the same taste for the beautiful as we\r\nhave. This is shewn by our enjoyment of the singing of birds, and by our\r\nwomen, both civilised and savage, decking their heads with borrowed\r\nplumes, and using gems which are hardly more brilliantly coloured than\r\nthe naked skin and wattles of certain birds.\r\n\r\nBefore treating of the characters with which we are here more\r\nparticularly concerned, I may just allude to certain differences between\r\nthe sexes which apparently depend on differences in their habits of\r\nlife; for such cases, though common in the lower, are rare in the higher\r\nclasses. Two humming-birds belonging to the genus Eustephanus, which\r\ninhabit the island of Juan Fernandez, were long thought to be\r\nspecifically distinct, but are now known, as Mr. Gould informs me, to be\r\nthe sexes of the same species, and they differ slightly in the form of\r\nthe beak. In another genus of humming-birds (_Grypus_), the beak of the\r\nmale is serrated along the margin and hooked at the extremity, thus\r\ndiffering much from that of the female. In the curious Neomorpha of New\r\nZealand, there is a still wider difference in the form of the beak; and\r\nMr. Gould has been informed that the male with his “straight and stout\r\nbeak” tears off the bark of trees, in order that the female may feed on\r\nthe uncovered larvæ with her weaker and more curved beak. Something of\r\nthe same kind may be observed with our goldfinch (_Carduelis elegans_),\r\nfor I am assured by Mr. J. Jenner Weir that the bird-catchers can\r\ndistinguish the males by their slightly longer beaks. The flocks of\r\nmales, as an old and trustworthy bird-catcher asserted, are commonly\r\nfound feeding on the seeds of the teazle (Dipsacus) which they can reach\r\nwith their elongated beaks, whilst the females more commonly feed on the\r\nseeds of the betony or Scrophularia. With a slight difference of this\r\nnature as a foundation, we can see how the beaks of the two sexes might\r\nbe made to differ greatly through natural selection. In all these cases,\r\nhowever, especially in that of the quarrelsome humming-birds, it is\r\npossible that the differences in the beaks may have been first acquired\r\nby the males in relation to their battles, and afterwards led to\r\nslightly changed habits of life.\r\n\r\n_Law of Battle._—Almost all male birds are extremely pugnacious, using\r\ntheir beaks, wings, and legs for fighting together. We see this every\r\nspring with our robins and sparrows. The smallest of all birds, namely\r\nthe humming-bird, is one of the most quarrelsome. Mr. Gosse[61]\r\ndescribes a battle, in which a pair of humming-birds seized hold of each\r\nother’s beaks, and whirled round and round, till they almost fell to the\r\nground; and M. Montes de Oca, in speaking of another genus, says that\r\ntwo males rarely meet without a fierce aerial encounter: when kept in\r\ncages “their fighting has mostly ended in the splitting of the tongue of\r\none of the two, which then surely dies from being unable to feed.”[62]\r\nWith Waders, the males of the common water-hen (_Gallinula chloropus_)\r\n“when pairing, fight violently for the females: they stand nearly\r\nupright in the water and strike with their feet.” Two were seen to be\r\nthus engaged for half an hour, until one got hold of the head of the\r\nother which would have been killed, had not the observer interfered; the\r\nfemale all the time looking on as a quiet spectator.[63] The males of an\r\nallied bird (_Gallicrex cristatus_), as Mr. Blyth informs me, are one\r\nthird larger than the females, and are so pugnacious during the\r\nbreeding-season, that they are kept by the natives of Eastern Bengal for\r\nthe sake of fighting. Various other birds are kept in India for the same\r\npurpose, for instance the Bulbuls (_Pycnonotus hæmorrhous_) which “fight\r\nwith great spirit.”[64]\r\n\r\nThe polygamous Ruff (_Machetes pugnax_, fig. 37) is notorious for his\r\nextreme pugnacity; and in the spring, the males, which are considerably\r\nlarger than the females, congregate day after day at a particular spot,\r\nwhere the females propose to lay their eggs. The fowlers discover these\r\nspots by the turf being trampled somewhat bare. Here they fight very\r\nmuch like game-cocks, seizing each other with their beaks and striking\r\nwith their wings. The great ruff of feathers round the neck is then\r\nerected, and according to Col. Montagu “sweeps the ground as a shield to\r\ndefend the more tender parts;” and this is the only instance known to me\r\nin the case of birds, of any structure serving as a shield. The ruff of\r\nfeathers, however, from its varied and rich colours probably serves in\r\nchief part as an ornament. Like most pugnacious birds, they seem always\r\nready to fight, and when closely confined often kill each other; but\r\nMontagu observed that their pugnacity becomes greater during the spring,\r\nwhen the long feathers on their necks are fully developed; and at this\r\nperiod the least movement by any one bird provokes a general\r\nbattle.[65] Of the pugnacity of web-footed birds, two instances will\r\nsuffice: in Guiana “bloody fights occur during the breeding-season\r\nbetween the males of the wild musk-duck (_Cairina moschata_); and where\r\nthese fights have occurred the river is covered for some distance with\r\nfeathers.”[66] Birds which seem ill-adapted for fighting engage in\r\nfierce conflicts; thus with the pelican the stronger males drive away\r\nthe weaker ones, snapping with their huge beaks and giving heavy blows\r\nwith their wings. Male snipes fight together, “tugging and pushing each\r\nother with their bills in the most curious manner imaginable.” Some few\r\nspecies are believed never to fight; this is the case, according to\r\nAudubon, with one of the woodpeckers of the United States (_Picus\r\nauratus_), although “the hens are followed by even half a dozen of their\r\ngay suitors.”[67]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. The Ruff or Machetes pugnax (from Brehm’s\r\n‘Thierleben’).]\r\n\r\nThe males of many birds are larger than the females, and this no doubt\r\nis an advantage to them in their battles with their rivals, and has been\r\ngained through sexual selection. The difference in size between the two\r\nsexes is carried to an extreme point in several Australian species; thus\r\nthe male musk-duck (Biziura) and the male _Cincloramphus cruralis_\r\n(allied to our pipits) are by measurement actually twice as large as\r\ntheir respective females.[68] With many other birds the females are\r\nlarger than the males; and as formerly remarked, the explanation often\r\ngiven, namely that the females have most of the work in feeding their\r\nyoung, will not suffice. In some few cases, as we shall hereafter see,\r\nthe females apparently have acquired their greater size and strength for\r\nthe sake of conquering other females and obtaining possession of the\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nThe males of many gallinaceous birds, especially of the polygamous\r\nkinds, are furnished with special weapons for fighting with their\r\nrivals, namely spurs, which can be used with fearful effect. It has been\r\nrecorded by a trustworthy writer[69] that in Derbyshire a kite struck at\r\na game-hen accompanied by her chickens, when the cock rushed to the\r\nrescue and drove his spur right through the eye and skull of the\r\naggressor. The spur was with difficulty drawn from the skull, and as the\r\nkite though dead retained his grasp, the two birds were firmly locked\r\ntogether; but the cock when disentangled was very little injured. The\r\ninvincible courage of the game-cock is notorious: a gentleman who long\r\nago witnessed the following brutal scene, told me that a bird had both\r\nits legs broken by some accident in the cock-pit, and the owner laid a\r\nwager that if the legs could be spliced so that the bird could stand\r\nupright, he would continue fighting. This was effected on the spot, and\r\nthe bird fought with undaunted courage until he received his\r\ndeath-stroke. In Ceylon a closely-allied and wild species, the _Gallus\r\nStanleyi_, is known to fight desperately “in defence of his seraglio,”\r\nso that one of the combatants is frequently found dead.[70] An Indian\r\npartridge (_Ortygornis gularis_), the male of which is furnished with\r\nstrong and sharp spurs, is so quarrelsome, “that the scars of former\r\nfights disfigure the breast of almost every bird you kill.”[71]\r\n\r\nThe males of almost all gallinaceous birds, even those which are not\r\nfurnished with spurs, engage during the breeding-season in fierce\r\nconflicts. The Capercailzie and Black-cock (_Tetrao urogallus_ and _T.\r\ntetrix_), which are both polygamists, have regular appointed places,\r\nwhere during many weeks they congregate in numbers to fight together and\r\nto display their charms before the females. M. W. Kowalevsky informs me\r\nthat in Russia he has seen the snow all bloody on the arenas where the\r\nCapercailzie have fought; and the Black-cocks “make the feathers fly in\r\nevery direction,” when several “engage in a battle royal.” The elder\r\nBrehm gives a curious account of the Balz, as the love-dance and\r\nlove-song of the Black-cock is called in Germany. The bird utters almost\r\ncontinuously the most strange noises: “he holds his tail up and spreads\r\nit out like a fan, he lifts up his head and neck with all the feathers\r\nerect, and stretches his wings from the body. Then he takes a few jumps\r\nin different directions, sometimes in a circle, and presses the under\r\npart of his beak so hard against the ground that the chin-feathers are\r\nrubbed off. During these movements he beats his wings and turns round\r\nand round. The more ardent he grows the more lively he becomes, until at\r\nlast the bird appears like a frantic creature.” At such times the\r\nblack-cocks are so absorbed that they become almost blind and deaf, but\r\nless so than the capercailzie: hence bird after bird may be shot on the\r\nsame spot, or even caught by the hand. After performing these antics the\r\nmales begin to fight: and the same black-cock, in order to prove his\r\nstrength over several antagonists, will visit in the course of one\r\nmorning several Balz-places, which remain the same during successive\r\nyears.[72]\r\n\r\nThe peacock with his long train appears more like a dandy than a\r\nwarrior, but he sometimes engages in fierce contests: the Rev. W. Darwin\r\nFox informs me that two peacocks became so excited whilst fighting at\r\nsome little distance from Chester that they flew over the whole city,\r\nstill fighting, until they alighted on the top of St. John’s tower.\r\n\r\nThe spur, in those gallinaceous birds which are thus provided, is\r\ngenerally single; but Polyplectron (see fig. 51, p. 90) has two or more\r\non each leg; and one of the Blood-pheasants (_Ithaginis cruentus_) has\r\nbeen seen with five spurs. The spurs are generally confined to the male,\r\nbeing represented by mere knobs or rudiments in the female; but the\r\nfemales of the Java peacock (_Pavo muticus_) and, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Blyth, of the small fire-backed pheasant (_Euplocamus\r\nerythropthalmus_) possess spurs. In Galloperdix it is usual for the\r\nmales to have two spurs, and for the females to have only one on each\r\nleg.[73] Hence spurs may safely be considered as a masculine character,\r\nthough occasionally transferred in a greater or less degree to the\r\nfemales. Like most other secondary sexual characters, the spurs are\r\nhighly variable both in number and development in the same species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Palamedea cornuta (from Brehm), shewing the\r\ndouble-wing-spurs, and the filament on the head.]\r\n\r\nVarious birds have spurs on their wings. But the Egyptian goose\r\n(_Chenalopex ægyptiacus_) has only “bare obtuse knobs,” and these\r\nprobably shew us the first steps by which true spurs have been developed\r\nin other allied birds. In the spur-winged goose, _Plectropterus\r\ngambensis_, the males have much larger spurs than the females; and they\r\nuse them, as I am informed by Mr. Bartlett, in fighting together, so\r\nthat, in this case, the wing-spurs serve as sexual weapons; but\r\naccording to Livingstone, they are chiefly used in the defence of the\r\nyoung. The Palamedea (fig. 38) is armed with a pair of spurs on each\r\nwing; and these are such formidable weapons that a single blow has\r\ndriven a dog howling away. But it does not appear that the spurs in this\r\ncase, or in that of some of the spur-winged rails, are larger in the\r\nmale than in the female.[74] In certain plovers, however, the wing-spurs\r\nmust be considered as a sexual character. Thus in the male of our common\r\npeewit (_Vanellus cristatus_) the tubercle on the shoulder of the wing\r\nbecomes more prominent during the breeding-season, and the males are\r\nknown to fight together. In some species of Lobivanellus a similar\r\ntubercle becomes developed during the breeding-season “into a short\r\nhorny spur.” In the Australian _L. lobatus_ both sexes have spurs, but\r\nthese are much larger in the males than in the females. In an allied\r\nbird, the _Hoplopterus armatus_, the spurs do not increase in size\r\nduring the breeding-season; but these birds have been seen in Egypt to\r\nfight together, in the same manner as our peewits, by turning suddenly\r\nin the air and striking sideways at each other, sometimes with a fatal\r\nresult. Thus also they drive away other enemies.[75]\r\n\r\nThe season of love is that of battle; but the males of some birds, as of\r\nthe game-fowl and ruff, and even the young males of the wild turkey and\r\ngrouse,[76] are ready to fight whenever they meet. The presence of the\r\nfemale is the _teterrima belli causa_. The Bengali baboos make the\r\npretty little males of the amadavat (_Estrelda amandava_) fight together\r\nby placing three small cages in a row, with a female in the middle;\r\nafter a little time the two males are turned loose, and immediately a\r\ndesperate battle ensues.[77] When many males congregate at the same\r\nappointed spot and fight together, as in the case of grouse and various\r\nother birds, they are generally attended by the females,[78] which\r\nafterwards pair with the victorious combatants. But in some cases the\r\npairing precedes instead of succeeding the combat: thus, according to\r\nAudubon,[79] several males of the Virginian goat-sucker (_Caprimulgus\r\nVirginianus_) “court, in a highly entertaining manner, the female, and\r\nno sooner has she made her choice, than her approved gives chase to all\r\nintruders, and drives them beyond his dominions.” Generally the males\r\ntry with all their power to drive away or kill their rivals before they\r\npair. It does not, however, appear that the females invariably prefer\r\nthe victorious males. I have indeed been assured by M. W. Kowalevsky\r\nthat the female capercailzie sometimes steals away with a young male who\r\nhas not dared to enter the arena with the older cocks; in the same\r\nmanner as occasionally happens with the does of the red-deer in\r\nScotland. When two males contend in presence of a single female, the\r\nvictor, no doubt, commonly gains his desire; but some of these battles\r\nare caused by wandering males trying to distract the peace of an already\r\nmated pair.[80]\r\n\r\nEven with the most pugnacious species it is probable that the pairing\r\ndoes not depend exclusively on the mere strength and courage of the\r\nmale: for such males are generally decorated with various ornaments,\r\nwhich often become more brilliant during the breeding-season, and which\r\nare sedulously displayed before the females. The males also endeavour to\r\ncharm or excite their mates by love-notes, songs, and antics; and the\r\ncourtship is, in many instances, a prolonged affair. Hence it is not\r\nprobable that the females are indifferent to the charms of the opposite\r\nsex, or that they are invariably compelled to yield to the victorious\r\nmales. It is more probable that the females are excited, either before\r\nor after the conflict, by certain males, and thus unconsciously prefer\r\nthem. In the case of _Tetrao umbellus_, a good observer[81] goes so far\r\nas to believe that the battles of the males “are all a sham, performed\r\nto show themselves to the greatest advantage before the admiring females\r\nwho assemble around; for I have never been able to find a maimed hero,\r\nand seldom more than a broken feather.” I shall have to recur to this\r\nsubject, but I may here add that with the _Tetrao cupido_ of the United\r\nStates, about a score of males assemble at a particular spot, and\r\nstrutting about make the whole air resound with their extraordinary\r\nnoises. At the first answer from a female the males begin to fight\r\nfuriously, and the weaker give way; but then, according to Audubon, both\r\nthe victors and vanquished search for the female, so that the females\r\nmust either then exert a choice, or the battle must be renewed. So,\r\nagain, with one of the Field-starlings of the United States (_Sturnella\r\nludoviciana_) the males engage in fierce conflicts, “but at the sight of\r\na female they all fly after her, as if mad.”[82]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vocal and instrumental Music._—With birds the voice serves to express\r\nvarious emotions, such as distress, fear, anger, triumph, or mere\r\nhappiness. It is apparently sometimes used to excite terror, as with the\r\nhissing noise made by some nestling-birds. Audubon[83] relates that a\r\nnight-heron (_Ardea nycticorax_, Linn.) which he kept tame, used to hide\r\nitself when a cat approached, and then “suddenly start up uttering one\r\nof the most frightful cries, apparently enjoying the cat’s alarm and\r\nflight.” The common domestic cock clucks to the hen, and the hen to her\r\nchickens, when a dainty morsel is found. The hen, when she has laid an\r\negg, “repeats the same note very often, and concludes with the sixth\r\nabove, which she holds for a longer time;”[84] and thus she expresses\r\nher joy. Some social birds apparently call to each other for aid; and as\r\nthey flit from tree to tree, the flock is kept together by chirp\r\nanswering chirp. During the nocturnal migrations of geese and other\r\nwater-fowl, sonorous clangs from the van may be heard in the darkness\r\noverhead, answered by clangs in the rear. Certain cries serve as\r\ndanger-signals, which, as the sportsman knows to his cost, are well\r\nunderstood by the same species and by others. The domestic cock crows,\r\nand the humming-bird chirps, in triumph over a defeated rival. The true\r\nsong, however, of most birds and various strange cries are chiefly\r\nuttered during the breeding-season, and serve as a charm, or merely as a\r\ncall-note, to the other sex.\r\n\r\nNaturalists are much divided with respect to the object of the singing\r\nof birds. Few more careful observers ever lived than Montagu, and he\r\nmaintained that the “males of song-birds and of many others do not in\r\ngeneral search for the female, but, on the contrary, their business in\r\nthe spring is to perch on some conspicuous spot breathing out their full\r\nand amorous notes, which, by instinct, the female knows, and repairs to\r\nthe spot to choose her mate.”[85] Mr. Jenner Weir informs me that this\r\nis certainly the case with the nightingale. Bechstein, who kept birds\r\nduring his whole life, asserts, “that the female canary always chooses\r\nthe best singer, and that in a state of nature the female finch selects\r\nthat male out of a hundred whose notes please her most.”[86] There can\r\nbe no doubt that birds closely attend to each other’s song. Mr. Weir has\r\ntold me of the case of a bullfinch which had been taught to pipe a\r\nGerman waltz, and who was so good a performer that he cost ten guineas;\r\nwhen this bird was first introduced into a room where other birds were\r\nkept and he began to sing, all the others, consisting of about twenty\r\nlinnets and canaries, ranged themselves on the nearest side of their\r\ncages, and listened with the greatest interest to the new performer.\r\nMany naturalists believe that the singing of birds is almost exclusively\r\n“the effect of rivalry and emulation,” and not for the sake of charming\r\ntheir mates. This was the opinion of Daines Barrington and White of\r\nSelborne, who both especially attended to this subject.[87] Barrington,\r\nhowever, admits that “superiority in song gives to birds an amazing\r\nascendancy over others, as is well known to bird-catchers.”\r\n\r\nIt is certain that there is an intense degree of rivalry between the\r\nmales in their singing. Bird-fanciers match their birds to see which\r\nwill sing longest; and I was told by Mr. Yarrell that a first-rate bird\r\nwill sometimes sing till he drops down almost dead, or, according to\r\nBechstein,[88] quite dead from rupturing a vessel in the lungs. Whatever\r\nthe cause may be, male birds, as I hear from Mr. Weir, often die\r\nsuddenly during the season of song. That the habit of singing is\r\nsometimes quite independent of love is clear, for a sterile hybrid\r\ncanary-bird has been described[89] as singing whilst viewing itself in a\r\nmirror, and then dashing at its own image; it likewise attacked with\r\nfury a female canary when put into the same cage. The jealousy excited\r\nby the act of singing is constantly taken advantage of by bird-catchers;\r\na male, in good song, is hidden and protected, whilst a stuffed bird,\r\nsurrounded by limed twigs, is exposed to view. In this manner a man, as\r\nMr. Weir informs me, has caught, in the course of a single day, fifty,\r\nand in one instance seventy, male chaffinches. The power and inclination\r\nto sing differ so greatly with birds that although the price of an\r\nordinary male chaffinch is only sixpence, Mr. Weir saw one bird for\r\nwhich the bird-catcher asked three pounds; the test of a really good\r\nsinger being that it will continue to sing whilst the cage is swung\r\nround the owner’s head.\r\n\r\nThat birds should sing from emulation as well as for the sake of\r\ncharming the female, is not at all incompatible; and, indeed, might have\r\nbeen expected to go together, like decoration and pugnacity. Some\r\nauthors, however, argue that the song of the male cannot serve to charm\r\nthe female, because the females of some few species, such as the canary,\r\nrobin, lark, and bullfinch, especially, as Bechstein remarks, when in a\r\nstate of widowhood, pour forth fairly melodious strains. In some of\r\nthese cases the habit of singing may be in part attributed to the\r\nfemales having been highly fed and confined,[90] for this disturbs all\r\nthe usual functions connected with the reproduction of the species. Many\r\ninstances have already been given of the partial transference of\r\nsecondary masculine characters to the female, so that it is not at all\r\nsurprising that the females of some species should possess the power of\r\nsong. It has also been argued, that the song of the male cannot serve as\r\na charm, because the males of certain species, for instance, of the\r\nrobin, sing during the autumn.[91] But nothing is more common than for\r\nanimals to take pleasure in practising whatever instinct they follow at\r\nother times for some real good. How often do we see birds which fly\r\neasily, gliding and sailing through the air obviously for pleasure. The\r\ncat plays with the captured mouse, and the cormorant with the captured\r\nfish. The weaver-bird (Ploceus), when confined in a cage, amuses itself\r\nby neatly weaving blades of grass between the wires of its cage. Birds\r\nwhich habitually fight during the breeding-season are generally ready to\r\nfight at all times; and the males of the capercailzie sometimes hold\r\ntheir _balzens_ or _leks_ at the usual place of assemblage during the\r\nautumn.[92] Hence it is not at all surprising that male birds should\r\ncontinue singing for their own amusement after the season for courtship\r\nis over.\r\n\r\nSinging is to a certain extent, as shewn in a previous chapter, an art,\r\nand is much improved by practice. Birds can be taught various tunes, and\r\neven the unmelodious sparrow has learnt to sing like a linnet. They\r\nacquire the song of their foster-parents,[93] and sometimes that of\r\ntheir neighbours.[94] All the common songsters belong to the Order of\r\nInsessores, and their vocal organs are much more complex than those of\r\nmost other birds; yet it is a singular fact that some of the Insessores,\r\nsuch as ravens, crows, and magpies, possess the proper apparatus,[95]\r\nthough they never sing, and do not naturally modulate their voices to\r\nany great extent. Hunter asserts[96] that with the true songsters the\r\nmuscles of the larynx are stronger in the males than in the females; but\r\nwith this slight exception there is no difference in the vocal organs of\r\nthe two sexes, although the males of most species sing so much better\r\nand more continuously than the females.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that only small birds properly sing. The Australian\r\ngenus Menura, however, must be excepted; for the _Menura Alberti_, which\r\nis about the size of a half-grown turkey, not only mocks other birds,\r\nbut “its own whistle is exceedingly beautiful and varied.” The males\r\ncongregate and form “_corroborying_ places,” where they sing, raising\r\nand spreading their tails like peacocks and drooping their wings.[97]\r\nIt is also remarkable that the birds which sing are rarely decorated\r\nwith brilliant colours or other ornaments. Of our British birds,\r\nexcepting the bullfinch and goldfinch, the best songsters are\r\nplain-coloured. The kingfisher, bee-eater, roller, hoopoe, woodpeckers,\r\n&c., utter harsh cries; and the brilliant birds of the tropics are\r\nhardly ever songsters.[98] Hence bright colours and the power of song\r\nseem to replace each other. We can perceive that if the plumage did not\r\nvary in brightness, or if bright colours were dangerous to the species,\r\nother means would have to be employed to charm the females; and the\r\nvoice being rendered melodious would offer one such means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Tetrao cupido; male. (From Brehm.)]\r\n\r\nIn some birds the vocal organs differ greatly in the two sexes. In the\r\n_Tetrao cupido_ (fig. 39) the male has two bare, orange-coloured sacks,\r\none on each side of the neck; and these are largely inflated when the\r\nmale, during the breeding-season, makes a curious hollow sound, audible\r\nat a great distance. Audubon proved that the sound was intimately\r\nconnected with this apparatus, which reminds us of the air-sacks on each\r\nside of the mouth of certain male frogs, for he found that the sound was\r\nmuch diminished when one of the sacks of a tame bird was pricked, and\r\nwhen both were pricked it was altogether stopped. The female has “a\r\nsomewhat similar, though smaller, naked space of skin on the neck; but\r\nthis is not capable of inflation.”[99] The male of another kind of\r\ngrouse (_Tetrao urophasianus_), whilst courting the female, has his\r\n“bare yellow œsophagus inflated to a prodigious size, fully half as\r\nlarge as the body;” and he then utters various grating, deep hollow\r\ntones. With his neck-feathers erect, his wings lowered and buzzing on\r\nthe ground, and his long pointed tail spread out like a fan, he displays\r\na variety of grotesque attitudes. The œsophagus of the female is not\r\nin any way remarkable.[100]\r\n\r\nIt seems now well made out that the great throat-pouch of the European\r\nmale bustard (_Otis tarda_), and of at least four other species, does\r\nnot serve, as was formerly supposed, to hold water, but is connected\r\nwith the utterance during the breeding-season of a peculiar sound\r\nresembling “ock.” The bird whilst uttering this sound throws himself\r\ninto the most extraordinary attitudes. It is a singular fact that with\r\nthe males of the same species the sack is not developed in all the\r\nindividuals.[101] A crow-like bird inhabiting South America\r\n(_Cephalopterus ornatus_, fig. 40) is called the umbrella-bird, from its\r\nimmense top-knot, formed of bare white quills surmounted by dark-blue\r\nplumes, which it can elevate into a great dome no less than five inches\r\nin diameter, covering the whole head. This bird has on its neck a long,\r\nthin, cylindrical, fleshy appendage, which is thickly clothed with\r\nscale-like blue feathers. It probably serves in part as an ornament, but\r\nlikewise as a resounding apparatus, for Mr. Bates found that it is\r\nconnected “with an unusual development of the trachea and vocal organs.”\r\nIt is dilated when the bird utters its singularly deep, loud, and\r\nlong-sustained fluty note. The head-crest and neck-appendage are\r\nrudimentary in the female.[102]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. The Umbrella-bird or Cephalopterus ornatus\r\n(male, from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nThe vocal organs of various web-footed and wading birds are\r\nextraordinarily complex, and differ to a certain extent in the two\r\nsexes. In some cases the trachea is convoluted, like a French horn, and\r\nis deeply embedded in the sternum. In the wild swan (_Cygnus ferus_) it\r\nis more deeply embedded in the adult male than in the female or young\r\nmale. In the male Merganser the enlarged portion of the trachea is\r\nfurnished with an additional pair of muscles.[103] But the meaning of\r\nthese differences between the sexes of many Anatidæ is not at all\r\nunderstood; for the male is not always the more vociferous; thus with\r\nthe common duck, the male hisses, whilst the female utters a loud\r\nquack.[104] In both sexes of one of the cranes (_Grus virgo_) the\r\ntrachea penetrates the sternum, but presents “certain sexual\r\nmodifications.” In the male of the black stork there is also a\r\nwell-marked sexual difference in the length and curvature of the\r\nbronchi.[105] So that highly important structures have in these cases\r\nbeen modified according to sex.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to conjecture whether the many strange cries and\r\nnotes, uttered by male birds during the breeding-season, serve as a\r\ncharm or merely as a call to the female. The soft cooing of the\r\nturtle-dove and of many pigeons, it may be presumed, pleases the female.\r\nWhen the female of the wild turkey utters her call in the morning, the\r\nmale answers by a different note from the gobbling noise which he makes,\r\nwhen with erected feathers, rustling wings and distended wattles, he\r\npuffs and struts before her.[106] The _spel_ of the black-cock certainly\r\nserves as a call to the female, for it has been known to bring four or\r\nfive females from a distance to a male under confinement; but as the\r\nblack-cock continues his _spel_ for hours during successive days, and in\r\nthe case of the capercailzie “with an agony of passion,” we are led to\r\nsuppose that the females which are already present are thus\r\ncharmed.[107] The voice of the common rook is known to alter during the\r\nbreeding-season, and is therefore in some way sexual.[108] But what\r\nshall we say about the harsh screams of, for instance, some kinds of\r\nmacaws; have these birds as bad taste for musical sounds as they\r\napparently have for colour, judging by the inharmonious contrast of\r\ntheir bright yellow and blue plumage? It is indeed possible that the\r\nloud voices of many male birds may be the result, without any advantage\r\nbeing thus gained, of the inherited effects of the continued use of\r\ntheir vocal organs, when they are excited by the strong passions of\r\nlove, jealousy, and rage; but to this point we shall recur when we treat\r\nof quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have as yet spoken only of the voice, but the males of various birds\r\npractise, during their courtship, what may be called instrumental music.\r\nPeacocks and Birds of Paradise rattle their quills together, and the\r\nvibratory movement apparently serves merely to make a noise, for it can\r\nhardly add to the beauty of their plumage. Turkey-cocks scrape their\r\nwings against the ground, and some kinds of grouse thus produce a\r\nbuzzing sound. Another North American grouse, the _Tetrao umbellus_,\r\nwhen with his tail erect, his ruffs displayed, “he shows off his finery\r\nto the females, who lie hid in the neighbourhood,” drums rapidly with\r\nhis “lowered wings on the trunk of a fallen tree,” or, according to\r\nAudubon, against his own body; the sound thus produced is compared by\r\nsome to distant thunder, and by others to the quick roll of a drum. The\r\nfemale never drums, “but flies directly to the place where the male is\r\nthus engaged.” In the Himalayas the male of the Kalij pheasant “often\r\nmakes a singular drumming noise with his wings, not unlike the sound\r\nproduced by shaking a stiff piece of cloth.” On the west coast of Africa\r\nthe little black-weavers (Ploceus?) congregate in a small party on the\r\nbushes round a small open space, and sing and glide through the air with\r\nquivering wings, “which make a rapid whirring sound like a child’s\r\nrattle.” One bird after another thus performs for hours together, but\r\nonly during the courting-season. At this same season the males of\r\ncertain nightjars (Caprimulgus) make a most strange noise with their\r\nwings. The various species of woodpeckers strike a sonorous branch with\r\ntheir beaks, with so rapid a vibratory movement that “the head appears\r\nto be in two places at once.” The sound thus produced is audible at a\r\nconsiderable distance, but cannot be described; and I feel sure that its\r\ncause would never be conjectured by any one who heard it for the first\r\ntime. As this jarring sound is made chiefly during the breeding-season,\r\nit has been considered as a love-song; but it is perhaps more strictly a\r\nlove-call. The female, when driven from her nest, has been observed thus\r\nto call her mate, who answered in the same manner and soon appeared.\r\nLastly the male Hoopoe (_Upupa epops_) combines vocal and instrumental\r\nmusic; for during the breeding-season this bird, as Mr. Swinhoe saw,\r\nfirst draws in air and then taps the end of its beak perpendicularly\r\ndown against a stone or the trunk of a tree, “when the breath being\r\nforced down the tubular bill produces the correct sound.” When the male\r\nutters its cry without striking his beak the sound is quite\r\ndifferent.[109]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Outer tail-feather of Scolopax gallinago (from\r\nProc. Zool. Soc. 1858).]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases sounds are made by the aid of structures already\r\npresent and otherwise necessary; but in the following cases certain\r\nfeathers have been specially modified for the express purpose of\r\nproducing the sounds. The drumming, or bleating, or neighing, or\r\nthundering noise, as expressed by different observers, which is made by\r\nthe common snipe (_Scolopax gallinago_) must have surprised every one\r\nwho has ever heard it. This bird, during the pairing-season, flies to\r\n“perhaps a thousand feet in height,” and after zig-zagging about for a\r\ntime descends in a curved line, with outspread tail and quivering\r\npinions, with surprising velocity to the earth. The sound is emitted\r\nonly during this rapid descent. No one was able to explain the cause,\r\nuntil M. Meves observed that on each side of the tail the outer feathers\r\nare peculiarly formed (fig. 41), having a stiff sabre-shaped shaft, with\r\nthe oblique barbs of unusual length, the outer webs being strongly\r\nbound together.\r\n\r\nHe found that by blowing on these feathers, or by fastening them to a\r\nlong thin stick and waving them rapidly through the air, he could\r\nexactly reproduce the drumming noise made by the living bird. Both sexes\r\nare furnished with these feathers, but they are generally larger in the\r\nmale than in the female, and emit a deeper note. In some species, as in\r\n_S. frenata_ (fig. 42), four feathers, and in _S. javensis_ (fig. 43),\r\nno less than eight on each side of the tail are greatly modified.\r\nDifferent tones are emitted by the feathers of the different species\r\nwhen waved through the air; and the _Scolopax Wilsonii_ of the United\r\nStates makes a switching noise whilst descending rapidly to the\r\nearth.[110]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. Outer tail-feather of Scolopax frenata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Outer tail-feather of Scolopax javensis.]\r\n\r\nIn the male of the _Chamæpetes unicolor_ (a large gallinaceous bird of\r\nAmerica) the first primary wing-feather is arched towards the tip and is\r\nmuch more attenuated than in the female. In an allied bird, the\r\n_Penelope nigra_, Mr. Salvin observed a male, which, whilst it flew\r\ndownwards “with outstretched wings, gave forth a kind of crashing,\r\nrushing noise,” like the falling of a tree.[111] The male alone of one\r\nof the Indian bustards _(Sypheotides auritus_) has its primary\r\nwing-feathers greatly acuminated; and the male of an allied species is\r\nknown to make a humming noise whilst courting the female.[112] In a\r\nwidely different group of birds, namely the Humming-birds, the males\r\nalone of certain kinds have either the shafts of their primary\r\nwing-feathers broadly dilated, or the webs abruptly excised towards the\r\nextremity. The male, for instance, of _Selasphorus platycercus_, when\r\nadult, has the first primary wing-feather (fig. 44), excised in this\r\nmanner. Whilst flying from flower to flower he makes “a shrill, almost\r\nwhistling, noise;”[113] but it did not appear to Mr. Salvin that the\r\nnoise was intentionally made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Primary wing-feather of a Humming-bird, the\r\n_Selasphorus platycercus_ (from a sketch by Mr. Salvin). Upper figure,\r\nthat of male; lower figure, corresponding feather of female.]\r\n\r\nLastly, in several species of a sub-genus of Pipra or Manakin, the males\r\nhave their _secondary_ wing-feathers modified, as described by Mr.\r\nSclater, in a still more remarkable manner. In the brilliantly-coloured\r\n_P. deliciosa_ the first three secondaries are thick-stemmed and curved\r\ntowards the body; in the fourth and fifth (fig. 45, _a_) the change is\r\ngreater; and in the sixth and seventh (_b_, _c_) the shaft “is thickened\r\nto an extraordinary degree, forming a solid horny lump.” The barbs also\r\nare greatly changed in shape, in comparison with the corresponding\r\nfeathers (_d_, _e_, _f_) in the female. Even the bones of the wing which\r\nsupport these singular feathers in the male are said by Mr. Fraser to be\r\nmuch thickened. These little birds make an extraordinary noise, the\r\nfirst “sharp note being not unlike the crack of a whip.”[114]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. Secondary wing-feathers of _Pipra\r\ndeliciosa_(from Mr. Sclater, in Proc, Zool. Soc. 1860). The three upper\r\nfeathers, _a_, _b_, _c_, from the male; the three lower corresponding\r\nfeathers, _d_, _e_, _f_, from the female.\r\n\r\n_a._ and _d._ Fifth secondary wing-feather of male and female, upper\r\nsurface. _b_ and _e_. Sixth secondary, upper surface. _c_ and _f_.\r\nSeventh secondary, lower surface.]\r\n\r\nThe diversity of the sounds, both vocal and instrumental, made by the\r\nmales of many species during the breeding-season, and the diversity of\r\nthe means for producing such sounds, are highly remarkable. We thus gain\r\na high idea of their importance for sexual purposes, and are reminded of\r\nthe same conclusion with respect to insects. It is not difficult to\r\nimagine the steps by which the notes of a bird, primarily used as a mere\r\ncall or for some other purpose, might have been improved into a\r\nmelodious love-song. This is somewhat more difficult in the case of the\r\nmodified feathers, by which the drumming, whistling, or roaring noises\r\nare produced. But we have seen that some birds during their courtship\r\nflutter, shake, or rattle their unmodified feathers together; and if the\r\nfemales were led to select the best performers, the males which\r\npossessed the strongest or thickest, or most attenuated feathers,\r\nsituated on any part of the body, would be the most successful; and thus\r\nby slow degrees the feathers might be modified to almost any extent. The\r\nfemales, of course, would not notice each slight successive alteration\r\nin shape, but only the sounds thus produced. It is a curious fact that\r\nin the same class of animals, sounds so different as the drumming of the\r\nsnipe’s tail, the tapping of the woodpecker’s beak, the harsh\r\ntrumpet-like cry of certain water-fowl, the cooing of the turtle-dove,\r\nand the song of the nightingale, should all be pleasing to the females\r\nof the several species. But we must not judge the tastes of distinct\r\nspecies by a uniform standard; nor must we judge by the standard of\r\nman’s taste. Even with man, we should remember what discordant noises,\r\nthe beating of tom-toms and the shrill notes of reeds, please the ears\r\nof savages. Sir S. Baker remarks,[115] that “as the stomach of the Arab\r\nprefers the raw meat and reeking liver taken hot from the animal, so\r\ndoes his ear prefer his equally coarse and discordant music to all\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Love-Antics and Dances._—The curious love-gestures of various birds,\r\nespecially of the Gallinaceæ, have already been incidentally noticed; so\r\nthat little need here be added. In Northern America, large numbers of a\r\ngrouse, the _Tetrao phasianellus_, meet every morning during the\r\nbreeding-season on a selected level spot, and here they run round and\r\nround in a circle of about fifteen or twenty feet in diameter, so that\r\nthe ground is worn quite bare, like a fairy-ring. In these\r\nPartridge-dances, as they are called by the hunters, the birds assume\r\nthe strangest attitudes, and run round, some to the left and some to the\r\nright. Audubon describes the males of a heron (_Ardea herodias_) as\r\nwalking about on their long legs with great dignity before the females,\r\nbidding defiance to their rivals. With one of the disgusting\r\ncarrion-vultures (_Cathartes jota_) the same naturalist states that “the\r\ngesticulations and parade of the males at the beginning of the\r\nlove-season are extremely ludicrous.” Certain birds perform their\r\nlove-antics on the wing, as we have seen with the black African weaver,\r\ninstead of on the ground. During the spring our little white-throat\r\n(_Sylvia cinerea_) often rises a few feet or yards in the air above some\r\nbush, and “flutters with a fitful and fantastic motion, singing all the\r\nwhile, and then drops to its perch.” The great English bustard throws\r\nhimself into indescribably odd attitudes whilst courting the female, as\r\nhas been figured by Wolf. An allied Indian bustard (_Otis bengalensis_)\r\nat such times “rises perpendicularly into the air with a hurried\r\nflapping of his wings, raising his crest and puffing out the feathers of\r\nhis neck and breast, and then drops to the ground;” he repeats this\r\nmanœuvre several times successively, at the same time humming in a\r\npeculiar tone. Such females as happen to be near “obey this saltatory\r\nsummons,” and when they approach he trails his wings and spreads his\r\ntail like a turkey-cock.[116]\r\n\r\nBut the most curious case is afforded by three allied genera of\r\nAustralian birds, the famous Bower-birds,—no doubt the co-descendants\r\nof some ancient species which first acquired the strange instinct of\r\nconstructing bowers for performing their love-antics. The bowers (fig.\r\n46), which, as we shall hereafter see, are highly decorated with\r\nfeathers, shells, bones and leaves, are built on the ground for the sole\r\npurpose of courtship, for their nests are formed in trees. Both sexes\r\nassist in the erection of the bowers, but the male is the principal\r\nworkman. So strong is this instinct that it is practised under\r\nconfinement, and Mr. Strange has described[117] the habits of some Satin\r\nBower-birds, which he kept in his aviary in New South Wales. “At times\r\nthe male will chase the female all over the aviary, then go to the\r\nbower, pick up a gay feather or a large leaf, utter a curious kind of\r\nnote, set all his feathers erect, run round the bower and become so\r\nexcited that his eyes appear ready to start from his head; he continues\r\nopening first one wing, and then the other, uttering a low, whistling\r\nnote, and, like the domestic cock, seems to be picking up something\r\nfrom the ground, until at last the female goes gently towards him.”\r\nCaptain Stokes has described the habits and “play-houses” of another\r\nspecies, the Great Bower-bird, which was seen “amusing itself by flying\r\nbackwards and forwards, taking a shell alternately from each side, and\r\ncarrying it through the archway in its mouth.” These curious structures,\r\nformed solely as halls of assemblages, where both sexes amuse themselves\r\nand pay their court, must cost the birds much labour. The bower, for\r\ninstance, of the fawn-breasted species, is nearly four feet in length,\r\neighteen inches in height, and is raised on a thick platform of sticks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. Bower-bird, Chlamydera maculata, with bower (from\r\nBrehm).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Decoration._—I will first discuss the cases in which the males are\r\nornamented either exclusively or in a much higher degree than the\r\nfemales; and in a succeeding chapter those in which both sexes are\r\nequally ornamented, and finally the rare cases in which the female is\r\nsomewhat more brightly-coloured than the male. As with the artificial\r\nornaments used by savage and civilised men, so with the natural\r\nornaments of birds, the head is the chief seat of decoration.[118] The\r\nornaments, as mentioned at the commencement of this chapter, are\r\nwonderfully diversified. The plumes on the front or back of the head\r\nconsist of variously-shaped feathers, sometimes capable of erection or\r\nexpansion, by which their beautiful colours are fully displayed. Elegant\r\near-tufts (see fig. 39 ante) are occasionally present. The head is\r\nsometimes covered with velvety down like that of the pheasant; or is\r\nnaked and vividly coloured; or supports fleshy appendages, filaments,\r\nand solid protuberances. The throat, also, is sometimes ornamented with\r\na beard, or with wattles or caruncles. Such appendages are generally\r\nbrightly coloured, and no doubt serve as ornaments, though not always\r\nornamental in our eyes; for whilst the male is in the act of courting\r\nthe female, they often swell and assume more vivid tints, as in the case\r\nof the male turkey. At such times the fleshy appendages about the head\r\nof the male Tragopan pheasant (_Ceriornis temminckii_) swell into a\r\nlarge lappet on the throat and into two horns, one on each side of the\r\nsplendid top-knot; and these are then coloured of the most intense blue\r\nwhich I have ever beheld. The African hornbill (_Bucorax abyssinicus_)\r\ninflates the scarlet bladder-like wattle on its neck, and with its wings\r\ndrooping and tail expanded “makes quite a grand appearance.”[119] Even\r\nthe iris of the eye is sometimes more brightly coloured in the male than\r\nin the female; and this is frequently the case with the beak, for\r\ninstance, in our common blackbird. In _Buceros corrugatus_, the whole\r\nbeak and immense casque are coloured more conspicuously in the male than\r\nin the female; and “the oblique grooves upon the sides of the lower\r\nmandible are peculiar to the male sex.”[120]\r\n\r\nThe males are often ornamented with elongated feathers or plumes\r\nspringing from almost every part of the body. The feathers on the throat\r\nand breast are sometimes developed into beautiful ruffs and collars. The\r\ntail-feathers are frequently increased in length; as we see in the\r\ntail-coverts of the peacock, and in the tail of the Argus pheasant. The\r\nbody of this latter bird is not larger than that of a fowl; yet the\r\nlength from the end of the beak to the extremity of the tail is no less\r\nthan five feet three inches.[121] The wing-feathers are not elongated\r\nnearly so often as the tail-feathers; for their elongation would impede\r\nthe act of flight. Yet the beautifully ocellated secondary wing-feathers\r\nof the male Argus pheasant are nearly three feet in length; and in a\r\nsmall African nightjar (_Cosmetornis vexillarius_) one of the primary\r\nwing-feathers, during the breeding-season, attains a length of\r\ntwenty-six inches, whilst the bird itself is only ten inches in length.\r\nIn another closely-allied genus of nightjars, the shafts of the\r\nelongated wing-feathers are naked, except at the extremity, where there\r\nis a disc.[122] Again, in another genus of nightjars, the tail-feathers\r\nare even still more prodigiously developed; so that we see the same kind\r\nof ornament gained by the males of closely-allied birds, through the\r\ndevelopment of widely different feathers.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the feathers of birds belonging to distinct\r\ngroups have been modified in almost exactly the same peculiar manner.\r\nThus the wing-feathers in one of the above-mentioned nightjars are bare\r\nalong the shaft and terminate in a disc; or are, as they are sometimes\r\ncalled, spoon or racket-shaped. Feathers of this kind occur in the tail\r\nof a motmot (_Eumomota superciliaris_), of a kingfisher, finch,\r\nhumming-bird, parrot, several Indian drongos (_Dicrurus_ and _Edolius_,\r\nin one of which the disc stands vertically), and in the tail of certain\r\nBirds of Paradise. In these latter birds, similar feathers, beautifully\r\nocellated, ornament the head, as is likewise the case with some\r\ngallinaceous birds. In an Indian bustard (_Sypheotides auritus_) the\r\nfeathers forming the ear-tufts, which are about four inches in length,\r\nalso terminate in discs.[123] The barbs of the feathers in various\r\nwidely-distinct birds are filamentous or plumose, as with some Herons,\r\nIbises, Birds of Paradise and Gallinaceæ. In other cases the barbs\r\ndisappear, leaving the shafts bare; and these in the tail of the\r\n_Paradisea apoda_ attain a length of thirty-four inches.[124] Smaller\r\nfeathers when thus denuded appear like bristles, as on the breast of the\r\nturkey-cock. As any fleeting fashion in dress comes to be admired by\r\nman, so with birds a change of almost any kind in the structure or\r\ncolouring of the feathers in the male appears to have been admired by\r\nthe female. The fact of the feathers in widely distinct groups, having\r\nbeen modified in an analogous manner, no doubt depends primarily on all\r\nthe feathers having nearly the same structure and manner of development,\r\nand consequently tending to vary in the same manner. We often see a\r\ntendency to analogous variability in the plumage of our domestic breeds\r\nbelonging to distinct species. Thus top-knots have appeared in several\r\nspecies. In an extinct variety of the turkey, the top-knot consisted of\r\nbare quills surmounted with plumes of down, so that they resembled, to a\r\ncertain extent, the racket-shaped feathers above described. In certain\r\nbreeds of the pigeon and fowl the feathers are plumose, with some\r\ntendency in the shafts to be naked. In the Sebastopol goose the scapular\r\nfeathers are greatly elongated, curled, or even spirally twisted, with\r\nthe margins plumose.[125]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. Paradisea rubra, male (from Brehm)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. Lophornis ornatus, male and female (from\r\nBrehm).]\r\n\r\nIn regard to colour hardly anything need here be said; for every one\r\nknows how splendid are the tints of birds, and how harmoniously they\r\nare combined. The colours are often metallic and iridescent. Circular\r\nspots are sometimes surrounded by one or more differently shaded zones,\r\nand are thus converted into ocelli. Nor need much be said on the\r\nwonderful differences between the sexes, or of the extreme beauty of the\r\nmales of many birds. The common peacock offers a striking instance.\r\nFemale Birds of Paradise are obscurely coloured and destitute of all\r\nornaments, whilst the males are probably the most highly decorated of\r\nall birds, and in so many ways, that they must be seen to be\r\nappreciated. The elongated and golden-orange plumes which spring from\r\nbeneath the wings of the _Paradisea apoda_ (see fig. 47 of _P. rubra_, a\r\nmuch less beautiful species), when vertically erected and made to\r\nvibrate, are described as forming a sort of halo, in the centre of which\r\nthe head “looks like a little emerald sun with its rays formed by the\r\ntwo plumes.”[126] In another most beautiful species the head is bald,\r\n“and of a rich cobalt blue, crossed by several lines of black velvety\r\nfeathers.”[127]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. Spathura underwoodi, male and female (from\r\nBrehm).]\r\n\r\nMale humming-birds (figs. 48 and 49) almost vie with Birds of Paradise\r\nin their beauty, as every one will admit who has seen Mr. Gould’s\r\nsplendid volumes or his rich collection. It is very remarkable in how\r\nmany different ways these birds are ornamented. Almost every part of the\r\nplumage has been taken advantage of and modified; and the modifications\r\nhave been carried, as Mr. Gould shewed me, to a wonderful extreme in\r\nsome species belonging to nearly every sub-group. Such cases are\r\ncuriously like those which we see in our fancy breeds, reared by man for\r\nthe sake of ornament: certain individuals originally varied in one\r\ncharacter, and other individuals belonging to the same species in other\r\ncharacters; and these have been seized on by man and augmented to an\r\nextreme point—as the tail of the fantail-pigeon, the hood of the\r\njacobin, the beak and wattle of the carrier, and so forth. The sole\r\ndifference between these cases is that in the one the result is due to\r\nman’s selection, whilst in the other, as with Humming-birds, Birds of\r\nParadise, &c., it is due to sexual selection,—that is to the selection\r\nby the females of the more beautiful males.\r\n\r\nI will mention only one other bird, remarkable from the extreme\r\ncontrast in colour between the sexes, namely the famous Bell-bird\r\n(_Chasmorhynchus niveus_) of S. America, the note of which can be\r\ndistinguished at the distance of nearly three miles, and astonishes\r\nevery one who first hears it. The male is pure white, whilst the female\r\nis dusky-green; and the former colour with terrestrial species of\r\nmoderate size and inoffensive habits is very rare. The male, also, as\r\ndescribed by Waterton, has a spiral tube, nearly three inches in length,\r\nwhich rises from the base of the beak. It is jet-black, dotted over with\r\nminute downy feathers. This tube can be inflated with air, through a\r\ncommunication with the palate; and when not inflated hangs down on one\r\nside. The genus consists of four species, the males of which are very\r\ndistinct, whilst the females, as described by Mr. Sclater in a most\r\ninteresting paper, closely resemble each other, thus offering an\r\nexcellent instance of the common rule that within the same group the\r\nmales differ much more from each other than do the females. In a second\r\nspecies (_C. nudicollis_) the male is likewise snow-white, with the\r\nexception of a large space of naked skin on the throat and round the\r\neyes, which during the breeding-season is of a fine green colour. In a\r\nthird species (_C. tricarunculatus_) the head and neck alone of the male\r\nare white, the rest of the body being chesnut-brown, and the male of\r\nthis species is provided with three filamentous projections half as long\r\nas the body—one rising from the base of the beak and the two others\r\nfrom the corners of the mouth.[128]\r\n\r\nThe coloured plumage and certain other ornaments of the males when\r\nadult are either retained for life or are periodically renewed during\r\nthe summer and breeding-season. At this season the beak and naked skin\r\nabout the head frequently change colour, as with some herons, ibises,\r\ngulls, one of the bell-birds just noticed, &c. In the white ibis, the\r\ncheeks, the inflatable skin of the throat, and the basal portion of the\r\nbeak, then become crimson.[129] In one of the rails, _Gallicrex\r\ncristatus_ a large red caruncle is developed during this same period on\r\nthe head of the male. So it is with a thin horny crest on the beak of\r\none of the pelicans, _P. erythrorhynchus_; for after the\r\nbreeding-season, these horny crests are shed, like horns from the heads\r\nof stags, and the shore of an island in a lake in Nevada was found\r\ncovered with these curious exuviæ.[130]\r\n\r\nChanges of colour in the plumage according to the season depend firstly\r\non a double annual moult, secondly on an actual change of colour in the\r\nfeathers themselves, and thirdly on their dull-coloured margins being\r\nperiodically shed, or on these three processes more or less combined.\r\nThe shedding of the deciduary margins may be compared with the shedding\r\nby very young birds of their down; for the down in most cases arises\r\nfrom the summits of the first true feathers.[131]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the birds which annually undergo a double moult, there\r\nare, firstly, some kinds, for instance snipes, swallow-plovers\r\n(Glareolæ), and curlews, in which the two sexes resemble each other and\r\ndo not change colour at any season. I do not know whether the\r\nwinter-plumage is thicker and warmer than the summer-plumage, which\r\nseems, when there is no change of colour, the most probable cause of a\r\ndouble moult. Secondly, there are birds, for instance certain species of\r\nTotanus and other grallatores, the sexes of which resemble each other,\r\nbut have a slightly different summer and winter plumage. The difference,\r\nhowever, in colour in these cases is so slight that it can hardly be an\r\nadvantage to them; and it may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct\r\naction of the different conditions to which the birds are exposed during\r\nthe two seasons. Thirdly, there are many other birds the sexes of which\r\nare alike, but which are widely different in their summer and winter\r\nplumage. Fourthly, there are birds, the sexes of which differ from each\r\nother in colour; but the females, though moulting twice, retain the same\r\ncolours throughout the year, whilst the males undergo a change,\r\nsometimes, as with certain bustards, a great change of colour. Fifthly\r\nand lastly, there are birds the sexes of which differ from each other in\r\nboth their summer and winter plumage, but the male undergoes a greater\r\namount of change at each recurrent season than the female—of which the\r\nRuff (_Machetes pugnax_) offers a good instance.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the cause or purpose of the differences in colour\r\nbetween the summer and winter plumage, this may in some instances, as\r\nwith the ptarmigan,[132] serve during both seasons as a protection. When\r\nthe difference between the two plumages is slight it may perhaps be\r\nattributed, as already remarked, to the direct action of the conditions\r\nof life. But with many birds there can hardly be a doubt that the summer\r\nplumage is ornamental, even when both sexes are alike. We may conclude\r\nthat this is the case with many herons, egrets, &c., for they acquire\r\ntheir beautiful plumes only during the breeding-season. Moreover, such\r\nplumes, top-knots, &c., though possessed by both sexes, are occasionally\r\na little more highly developed in the male than in the female; and they\r\nresemble the plumes and ornaments possessed by the males alone of other\r\nbirds. It is also known that confinement, by affecting the reproductive\r\nsystem of male birds, frequently checks the development of their\r\nsecondary sexual characters, but has no immediate influence on any other\r\ncharacters; and I am informed by Mr. Bartlett that eight or nine\r\nspecimens of the Knot (_Tringa canutus_) retained their unadorned winter\r\nplumage in the Zoological Gardens throughout the year, from which fact\r\nwe may infer that the summer plumage though common to both sexes\r\npartakes of the nature of the exclusively masculine plumage of many\r\nother birds.[133]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts, more especially from neither sex of certain\r\nbirds changing colour during either annual moult, or changing so\r\nslightly that the change can hardly be of any service to them, and from\r\nthe females of other species moulting twice yet retaining the same\r\ncolours throughout the year, we may conclude that the habit of moulting\r\ntwice in the year has not been acquired in order that the male should\r\nassume during the breeding-season an ornamental character; but that the\r\ndouble moult, having been originally acquired for some distinct purpose,\r\nhas subsequently been taken advantage of in certain cases for gaining a\r\nnuptial plumage.\r\n\r\nIt appears at first sight a surprising circumstance that with\r\nclosely-allied birds, some species should regularly undergo a double\r\nannual moult, and others only a single one. The ptarmigan, for instance,\r\nmoults twice or even thrice in the year, and the black-cock only once:\r\nsome of the splendidly-coloured honey-suckers (Nectariniæ) of India and\r\nsome sub-genera of obscurely-coloured pipits (Anthus) have a double,\r\nwhilst others have only a single annual moult.[134] But the gradations\r\nin the manner of moulting, which are known to occur with various birds,\r\nshew us how species, or whole groups of species, might have originally\r\nacquired their double annual moult, or having once gained the habit,\r\nhave again lost it. With certain bustards and plovers the vernal moult\r\nis far from complete, some feathers being renewed, and some changed in\r\ncolour. There is also reason to believe that with certain bustards and\r\nrail-like birds, which properly undergo a double moult, some of the\r\nolder males retain their nuptial plumage throughout the year. A few\r\nhighly modified feathers may alone be added during the spring to the\r\nplumage, as occurs with the disc-formed tail-feathers of certain drongos\r\n(_Bhringa_) in India, and with the elongated feathers on the back, neck,\r\nand crest of certain herons. By such steps as these, the vernal moult\r\nmight be rendered more and more complete, until a perfect double moult\r\nwas acquired. A gradation can also be shewn to exist in the length of\r\ntime during which either annual plumage is retained; so that the one\r\nmight come to be retained for the whole year, the other being completely\r\nlost. Thus the _Machetes pugnax_ retains his ruff in the spring for\r\nbarely two months. The male widow-bird (_Chera progne_) acquires in\r\nNatal his fine plumage and long tail-feathers in December or January and\r\nloses them in March; so that they are retained during only about three\r\nmonths. Most species which undergo a double moult keep their ornamental\r\nfeathers for about six months. The male, however, of the wild _Gallus\r\nbankiva_ retains his neck-hackles for nine or ten months; and when these\r\nare cast off, the underlying black feathers on the neck are fully\r\nexposed to view. But with the domesticated descendant of this species,\r\nthe neck-hackles of the male are immediately replaced by new ones; so\r\nthat we here see, with respect to part of the plumage, a double moult\r\nchanged under domestication into a single moult.[135]\r\n\r\nThe common drake (_Anas boschas_) is well known after the\r\nbreeding-season to lose his male plumage for a period of three months,\r\nduring which time he assumes that of the female. The male pintail-duck\r\n(_Anas acuta_) loses his plumage for the shorter period of six weeks or\r\ntwo months; and Montagu remarks that “this double moult within so short\r\na time is a most extraordinary circumstance, that seems to bid defiance\r\nto all human reasoning.” But he who believes in the gradual modification\r\nof species will be far from feeling surprise at finding gradations of\r\nall kinds. If the male pintail were to acquire his new plumage within a\r\nstill shorter period, the new male feathers would almost necessarily be\r\nmingled with the old, and both with some proper to the female; and this\r\napparently is the case with the male of a not distantly-allied bird,\r\nnamely the _Merganser serrator_, for the males are said to “undergo a\r\nchange of plumage, which assimilates them in some measure to the\r\nfemale.” By a little further acceleration in the process, the double\r\nmoult would be completely lost.[136]\r\n\r\nSome male birds, as before stated, become more brightly coloured in the\r\nspring, not by a vernal moult, but either by an actual change of colour\r\nin the feathers, or by their obscurely-coloured deciduary margins being\r\nshed. Changes of colour thus caused may last for a longer or shorter\r\ntime. With the _Pelecanus onocrotalus_ a beautiful rosy tint, with\r\nlemon-coloured marks on the breast, overspreads the whole plumage in the\r\nspring; but these tints, as Mr. Sclater states, “do not last long,\r\ndisappearing generally in about six weeks or two months after they have\r\nbeen attained.” Certain finches shed the margins of their feathers in\r\nthe spring, and then become brighter-coloured, while other finches\r\nundergo no such change. Thus the _Fringilla tristis_ of the United\r\nStates (as well as many other American species), exhibits its bright\r\ncolours only when the winter is past, whilst our goldfinch, which\r\nexactly represents this bird in habits, and our siskin, which\r\nrepresents it still more closely in structure, undergo no such annual\r\nchange. But a difference of this kind in the plumage of allied species\r\nis not surprising, for with the common linnet, which belongs to the same\r\nfamily, the crimson forehead and breast are displayed only during the\r\nsummer in England, whilst in Madeira these colours are retained\r\nthroughout the year.[137]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Display by Male Birds of their Plumage._—Ornaments of all kinds,\r\nwhether permanently or temporarily gained, are sedulously displayed by\r\nthe males, and apparently serve to excite, or attract, or charm the\r\nfemales. But the males will sometimes display their ornaments, when not\r\nin the presence of the females, as occasionally occurs with grouse at\r\ntheir balz-places, and as may be noticed with the peacock; this latter\r\nbird, however, evidently wishes for a spectator of some kind, and will\r\nshew off his finery, as I have often seen, before poultry or even\r\npigs.[138] All naturalists who have closely attended to the habits of\r\nbirds, whether in a state of nature or under confinement, are\r\nunanimously of opinion that the males delight to display their beauty.\r\nAudubon frequently speaks of the male as endeavouring in various ways to\r\ncharm the female. Mr. Gould, after describing some peculiarities in a\r\nmale humming-bird, says he has no doubt that it has the power of\r\ndisplaying them to the greatest advantage before the female. Dr.\r\nJerdon[139] insists that the beautiful plumage of the male serves “to\r\nfascinate and attract the female.” Mr. Bartlett, at the Zoological\r\nGardens, expressed himself to me in the strongest terms to the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt must be a grand sight in the forests of India “to come suddenly on\r\ntwenty or thirty peafowl, the males displaying their gorgeous trains,\r\nand strutting about in all the pomp of pride before the gratified\r\nfemales.” The wild turkey-cock erects his glittering plumage, expands\r\nhis finely-zoned tail and barred wing-feathers, and altogether, with his\r\ngorged crimson and blue wattles, makes a superb, though, to our eyes,\r\ngrotesque appearance. Similar facts have already been given with respect\r\nto grouse of various kinds. Turning to another Order. The male _Rupicola\r\ncrocea_ (fig. 50) is one of the most beautiful birds in the world, being\r\nof a splendid orange, with some of the feathers curiously truncated and\r\nplumose. The female is brownish-green, shaded with red, and has a much\r\nsmaller crest. Sir R. Schomburgk has described their courtship; he found\r\none of their meeting-places where ten males and two females were\r\npresent. The space was from four to five feet in diameter, and appeared\r\nto have been cleared of every blade of grass and smoothed as if by human\r\nhands. A male “was capering to the apparent delight of several others.\r\nNow spreading its wings, throwing up its head, or opening its tail like\r\na fan; now strutting about with a hopping gait until tired, when it\r\ngabbled some kind of note, and was relieved by another. Thus three of\r\nthem successively took the field, and then, with self-approbation,\r\nwithdrew to rest.” The Indians, in order to obtain their skins, wait at\r\none of the meeting-places till the birds are eagerly engaged in dancing,\r\nand then are able to kill, with their poisoned arrows, four or five\r\nmales, one after the other.[140] With Birds of Paradise a dozen or more\r\nfull-plumaged males congregate in a tree to hold a dancing-party, as it\r\nis called by the natives; and here flying about, raising their wings,\r\nelevating their exquisite plumes, and making them vibrate, the whole\r\ntree seems, as Mr. Wallace remarks, to be filled with waving plumes.\r\nWhen thus engaged, they become so absorbed that a skilful archer may\r\nshoot nearly the whole party. These birds, when kept in confinement in\r\nthe Malay Archipelago, are said to take much care in keeping their\r\nfeathers clean; often spreading them out, examining them, and removing\r\nevery speck of dirt. One observer, who kept several pairs alive, did not\r\ndoubt that the display of the male was intended to please the\r\nfemale.[141]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. Rupicola crocea, male (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nThe gold pheasant (_Thaumalea picta_) during his courtship not only\r\nexpands and raises his splendid frill, but turns it, as I have myself\r\nseen, obliquely towards the female on whichever side she may be\r\nstanding, obviously in order that a large surface may be displayed\r\nbefore her.[142] Mr. Bartlett has observed a male Polyplectron (fig. 51)\r\nin the act of courtship, and has shewn me a specimen stuffed in the\r\nattitude then assumed. The tail and wing-feathers of this bird are\r\nornamented with beautiful ocelli, like those on the peacock’s train. Now\r\nwhen the peacock displays himself, he expands and erects his tail\r\ntransversely to his body, for he stands in front of the female, and has\r\nto shew off, at the same time, his rich blue throat and breast. But the\r\nbreast of the Polyplectron is obscurely coloured, and the ocelli are not\r\nconfined to the tail-feathers. Consequently the Polyplectron does not\r\nstand in front of the female; but he erects and expands his\r\ntail-feathers a little obliquely, lowering the expanded wing on the\r\nsame side, and raising that on the opposite side. In this attitude the\r\nocelli over the whole body are exposed before the eyes of the admiring\r\nfemale in one grand bespangled expanse. To whichever side she may turn,\r\nthe expanded wings and the obliquely-held tail are turned towards her.\r\nThe male Tragopan pheasant acts in nearly the same manner, for he raises\r\nthe feathers of the body, though not the wing itself, on the side which\r\nis opposite to the female, and which would otherwise be concealed, so\r\nthat nearly all the beautifully-spotted feathers are exhibited at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. Polyplectron chinquis, male (from Brehm)]\r\n\r\nThe case of the Argus pheasant is still more striking. The immensely\r\ndeveloped secondary wing-feathers, which are confined to the male, are\r\nornamented with a row of from twenty to twenty-three ocelli, each above\r\nan inch in diameter. The feathers are also elegantly marked with oblique\r\ndark stripes and rows of spots, like those on the skin of a tiger and\r\nleopard combined. The ocelli are so beautifully shaded that, as the Duke\r\nof Argyll remarks,[143] they stand out like a ball lying loosely within\r\na socket. But when I looked at the specimen in the British Museum, which\r\nis mounted with the wings expanded and trailing downwards, I was greatly\r\ndisappointed, for the ocelli appeared flat or even concave. Mr. Gould,\r\nhowever, soon made the case clear to me, for he had made a drawing of a\r\nmale whilst he was displaying himself. At such times the long secondary\r\nfeathers in both wings are vertically erected and expanded; and these,\r\ntogether with the enormously elongated tail-feathers, make a grand\r\nsemicircular upright fan. Now as soon as the wing-feathers are held in\r\nthis position, and the light shines on them from above, the full effect\r\nof the shading comes out, and each ocellus at once resembles the\r\nornament called a ball and socket. These feathers have been shewn to\r\nseveral artists, and all have expressed their admiration at the perfect\r\nshading.\r\n\r\nIt may well be asked, could such artistically-shaded ornaments have been\r\nformed by means of sexual selection? But it will be convenient to defer\r\ngiving an answer to this question until we treat in the next chapter of\r\nthe principle of gradation.\r\n\r\nThe primary wing-feathers, which in most gallinaceous birds are\r\nuniformly coloured, are in the Argus pheasant not less wonderful objects\r\nthan the secondary wing-feathers. They are of a soft brown tint with\r\nnumerous dark spots, each of which consists of two or three black dots\r\nwith a surrounding dark zone. But the chief ornament is a space parallel\r\nto the dark-blue shaft, which in outline forms a perfect second feather\r\nlying within the true feather. This inner part is coloured of a lighter\r\nchesnut, and is thickly dotted with minute white points. I have shewn\r\nthis feather to several persons, and many have admired it even more than\r\nthe ball-and-socket feathers, and have declared that it was more like a\r\nwork of art than of nature. Now these feathers are quite hidden on all\r\nordinary occasions, but are fully displayed when the long secondary\r\nfeathers are erected, though in a widely different manner; for they are\r\nexpanded in front like two little fans or shields, one on each side of\r\nthe breast near the ground.\r\n\r\nThe case of the male Argus pheasant is eminently interesting, because it\r\naffords good evidence that the most refined beauty may serve as a charm\r\nfor the female, and for no other purpose. We must conclude that this is\r\nthe case, as the primary wing-feathers are never displayed, and the\r\nball-and-socket ornaments are not exhibited in full perfection, except\r\nwhen the male assumes the attitude of courtship. The Argus pheasant does\r\nnot possess brilliant colours, so that his success in courtship appears\r\nto have depended on the great size of his plumes, and on the\r\nelaboration of the most elegant patterns. Many will declare that it is\r\nutterly incredible that a female bird should be able to appreciate fine\r\nshading and exquisite patterns. It is undoubtedly a marvellous fact that\r\nshe should possess this almost human degree of taste, though perhaps she\r\nadmires the general effect rather than each separate detail. He who\r\nthinks that he can safely gauge the discrimination and taste of the\r\nlower animals, may deny that the female Argus pheasant can appreciate\r\nsuch refined beauty; but he will then be compelled to admit that the\r\nextraordinary attitudes assumed by the male during the act of courtship,\r\nby which the wonderful beauty of his plumage is fully displayed, are\r\npurposeless; and this is a conclusion which I for one will never admit.\r\n\r\nAlthough so many pheasants and allied gallinaceous birds carefully\r\ndisplay their beautiful plumage before the females, it is remarkable, as\r\nMr. Bartlett informs me, that this is not the case with the\r\ndull-coloured Eared and Cheer pheasants (_Crossoptilon auritum_ and\r\n_Phasianus Wallichii_); so that these birds seem conscious that they\r\nhave little beauty to display. Mr. Bartlett has never seen the males of\r\neither of these species fighting together, though he has not had such\r\ngood opportunities for observing the Cheer as the Eared pheasant. Mr.\r\nJenner Weir, also, finds that all male birds with rich or\r\nstrongly-characterised plumage are more quarrelsome than the\r\ndull-coloured species belonging to the same groups. The goldfinch, for\r\ninstance, is far more pugnacious than the linnet, and the blackbird\r\nthan the thrush. Those birds which undergo a seasonal change of plumage\r\nlikewise become much more pugnacious at the period when they are most\r\ngaily ornamented. No doubt the males of some obscurely-coloured birds\r\nfight desperately together, but it appears that when sexual selection\r\nhas been highly influential, and has given bright colours to the males\r\nof any species, it has also very often given a strong tendency to\r\npugnacity. We shall meet with nearly analogous cases when we treat of\r\nmammals. On the other hand, with birds the power of song and brilliant\r\ncolours have rarely been both acquired by the males of the same species;\r\nbut in this case, the advantage gained would have been identically the\r\nsame, namely success in charming the female. Nevertheless it must be\r\nowned that the males of several brilliantly-coloured birds have had\r\ntheir feathers specially modified for the sake of producing instrumental\r\nmusic, though the beauty of this cannot be compared, at least according\r\nto our taste, with that of the vocal music of many songsters.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to male birds which are not ornamented in any very high\r\ndegree, but which nevertheless display, during their courtship, whatever\r\nattractions they may possess. These cases are in some respects more\r\ncurious than the foregoing, and have been but little noticed. I owe the\r\nfollowing facts, selected from a large body of valuable notes, sent to\r\nme by Mr. Jenner Weir, who has long kept birds of many kinds, including\r\nall the British Fringillidæ and Emberizidæ. The bullfinch makes his\r\nadvances in front of the female, and then puffs out his breast, so that\r\nmany more of the crimson feathers are seen at once than otherwise would\r\nbe the case. At the same time he twists and bows his black tail from\r\nside to side in a ludicrous manner. The male chaffinch also stands in\r\nfront of the female, thus shewing his red breast, and “blue bell,” as\r\nthe fanciers call his head; the wings at the same time being slightly\r\nexpanded, with the pure white bands on the shoulders thus rendered\r\nconspicuous. The common linnet distends his rosy breast, slightly\r\nexpands his brown wings and tail, so as to make the best of them by\r\nexhibiting their white edgings. We must, however, be cautious in\r\nconcluding that the wings are spread out solely for display, as some\r\nbirds act thus whose wings are not beautiful. This is the case with the\r\ndomestic cock, but it is always the wing on the side opposite to the\r\nfemale which is expanded, and at the same time scraped on the ground.\r\nThe male goldfinch behaves differently from all other finches: his wings\r\nare beautiful, the shoulders being black, with the dark-tipped\r\nwing-feathers spotted with white and edged with golden yellow. When he\r\ncourts the female, he sways his body from side to side, and quickly\r\nturns his slightly expanded wings first to one side then to the other,\r\nwith a golden flashing effect. No other British finch, as Mr. Weir\r\ninforms me, turns during his courtship from side to side in this manner;\r\nnot even the closely-allied male siskin, for he would not thus add to\r\nhis beauty.\r\n\r\nMost of the British Buntings are plain-coloured birds; but in the spring\r\nthe feathers on the head of the male reed-bunting (_Emberiza\r\nschœniculus_) acquire a fine black colour by the abrasion of the\r\ndusky tips; and these are erected during the act of courtship. Mr. Weir\r\nhas kept two species of Amadina from Australia: the _A. castanotis_ is a\r\nvery small and chastely-coloured finch, with a dark tail, white rump,\r\nand jet-black upper tail-coverts, each of the latter being marked with\r\nthree large conspicuous oval spots of white.[144] This species, when\r\ncourting the female, slightly spreads out and vibrates these\r\nparti-coloured tail-coverts in a very peculiar manner. The male _Amadina\r\nLathami_ behaves very differently, exhibiting before the female his\r\nbrilliantly-spotted breast and scarlet rump and scarlet upper\r\ntail-coverts. I may here add from Dr. Jerdon, that the Indian Bulbul\r\n(_Pycnonotus hæmorrhous_) has crimson _under_ tail-coverts, and the\r\nbeauty of these feathers, it might be thought, could never be well\r\nexhibited; but the bird “when excited often spreads them out laterally,\r\nso that they can be seen even from above.”[145] The common pigeon has\r\niridescent feathers on the breast, and every one must have seen how the\r\nmale inflates his breast whilst courting the female, thus showing off\r\nthese feathers to the best advantage. One of the beautiful bronze-winged\r\npigeons of Australia (_Ocyphaps lophotes_) behaves, as described to me\r\nby Mr. Weir, very differently: the male, whilst standing before the\r\nfemale, lowers his head almost to the ground, spreads out and raises\r\nperpendicularly his tail, and half expands his wings. He then\r\nalternately and slowly raises and depresses his body, so that the\r\niridescent metallic feathers are all seen at once, and glitter in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nSufficient facts have now been given to shew with what care male birds\r\ndisplay their various charms, and this they do with the utmost skill.\r\nWhilst preening their feathers, they have frequent opportunities for\r\nadmiring themselves and of studying how best to exhibit their beauty.\r\nBut as all the males of the same species display themselves in exactly\r\nthe same manner, it appears that actions, at first perhaps intentional,\r\nhave become instinctive. If so, we ought not to accuse birds of\r\nconscious vanity; yet when we see a peacock strutting about, with\r\nexpanded and quivering tail-feathers, he seems the very emblem of pride\r\nand vanity.\r\n\r\nThe various ornaments possessed by the males are certainly of the\r\nhighest importance to them, for they have been acquired in some cases at\r\nthe expense of greatly impeded powers of flight or of running. The\r\nAfrican nightjar (_Cosmetornis_), which during the pairing-season has\r\none of its primary wing-feathers developed into a streamer of extreme\r\nlength, is thus much retarded in its flight, although at other times\r\nremarkable for its swiftness. The “unwieldy size” of the secondary\r\nwing-feathers of the male Argus pheasant are said “almost entirely to\r\ndeprive the bird of flight.” The fine plumes of male Birds of Paradise\r\ntrouble them during a high wind. The extremely long tail-feathers of the\r\nmale widow-birds (Vidua) of Southern Africa render “their flight heavy;”\r\nbut as soon as these are cast off they fly as well as the females. As\r\nbirds always breed when food is abundant, the males probably do not\r\nsuffer much inconvenience in searching for food from their impeded\r\npowers of movement; but there can hardly be a doubt that they must be\r\nmuch more liable to be struck down by birds of prey. Nor can we doubt\r\nthat the long train of the peacock and the long tail and wing-feathers\r\nof the Argus pheasant must render them a more easy prey to any prowling\r\ntiger-cat than would otherwise be the case. Even the bright colours of\r\nmany male birds cannot fail to make them conspicuous to their enemies of\r\nall kinds. Hence it probably is, as Mr. Gould has remarked, that such\r\nbirds are generally of a shy disposition, as if conscious that their\r\nbeauty was a source of danger, and are much more difficult to discover\r\nor approach, than the sombre-coloured and comparatively tame females, or\r\nthan the young and as yet unadorned males.[146]\r\n\r\nIt is a more curious fact that the males of some birds which are\r\nprovided with special weapons for battle, and which in a state of nature\r\nare so pugnacious that they often kill each other, suffer from\r\npossessing certain ornaments. Cock-fighters trim the hackles and cut off\r\nthe comb and gills of their cocks; and the birds are then said to be\r\ndubbed. An undubbed bird, as Mr. Tegetmeier insists, “is at a fearful\r\ndisadvantage: the comb and gills offer an easy hold to his adversary’s\r\nbeak, and as a cock always strikes where he holds, when once he has\r\nseized his foe, he has him entirely in his power. Even supposing that\r\nthe bird is not killed, the loss of blood suffered by an undubbed cock\r\nis much greater than that sustained by one that has been trimmed.”[147]\r\nYoung turkey-cocks in fighting always seize hold of each other’s\r\nwattles; and I presume that the old birds fight in the same manner. It\r\nmay perhaps be objected that the comb and wattles are not ornamental,\r\nand cannot be of service to the birds in this way; but even to our eyes,\r\nthe beauty of the glossy black Spanish cock is much enhanced by his\r\nwhite face and crimson comb; and no one who has ever seen the splendid\r\nblue wattles of the male Tragopan pheasant, when distended during the\r\nact of courtship, can for a moment doubt that beauty is the object\r\ngained. From the foregoing facts we clearly see that the plumes and\r\nother ornaments of the male must be of the highest importance to him;\r\nand we further see that beauty in some cases is even more important than\r\nsuccess in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nBIRDS—_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Choice exerted by the female—Length of courtship—Unpaired\r\n   birds—Mental qualities and taste for the\r\n   beautiful—Preference or antipathy shewn by the female for\r\n   particular males—Variability of birds—Variations sometimes\r\n   abrupt—Laws of variation—Formation of ocelli—Gradations of\r\n   character—Case of Peacock, Argus pheasant, and Urosticte.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the sexes differ in beauty, in the power of singing, or in\r\nproducing what I have called instrumental music, it is almost invariably\r\nthe male which excels the female. These qualities, as we have just seen,\r\nare evidently of high importance to the male. When they are gained for\r\nonly a part of the year, this is always shortly before the\r\nbreeding-season. It is the male alone who elaborately displays his\r\nvaried attractions, and often performs strange antics on the ground or\r\nin the air, in the presence of the female. Each male drives away or, if\r\nhe can, kills all his rivals. Hence we may conclude, that it is the\r\nobject of the male to induce the female to pair with him, and for this\r\npurpose he tries to excite or charm her in various ways; and this is the\r\nopinion of all those who have carefully studied the habits of living\r\nbirds. But there remains a question which has an all important bearing\r\non sexual selection, namely, does every male of the same species equally\r\nexcite and attract the female? or does she exert a choice, and prefer\r\ncertain males? This question can be answered in the affirmative by much\r\ndirect and indirect evidence. It is much more difficult to decide what\r\nqualities determine the choice of the females; but here again we have\r\nsome direct and indirect evidence that it is to a large extent the\r\nexternal attractions of the male, though no doubt his vigour, courage,\r\nand other mental qualities come into play. We will begin with the\r\nindirect evidence.\r\n\r\n_Length of Courtship._—The lengthened period during which both sexes of\r\ncertain birds meet day after day at an appointed place, probably depends\r\npartly on the courtship being a prolonged affair, and partly on the\r\nreiteration of the act of pairing. Thus in Germany and Scandinavia the\r\nbalzens or leks of the Black-cocks, last from the middle of March, all\r\nthrough April into May. As many as forty or fifty, or even more birds\r\ncongregate at the leks; and the same place is often frequented during\r\nsuccessive years. The lek of the Capercailzie lasts from the end of\r\nMarch to the middle or even end of May. In North America “the partridge\r\ndances” of the _Tetrao phasianellus_ “last for a month or more.” Other\r\nkinds of grouse both in North America and Eastern Siberia[148] follow\r\nnearly the same habits. The fowlers discover the hillocks where the\r\nRuffs congregate by the grass being trampled bare, and this shews that\r\nthe same spot is long frequented. The Indians of Guiana are well\r\nacquainted with the cleared arenas, where they expect to find the\r\nbeautiful Cocks of the Rock; and the natives of New Guinea know the\r\ntrees where from ten to twenty full-plumaged male Birds of\r\nParadise congregate. In this latter case it is not expressly stated that\r\nthe females meet on the same trees, but the hunters, if not specially\r\nasked, would not probably mention their presence, as their skins are\r\nvalueless. Small parties of an African weaver (_Ploceus_) congregate,\r\nduring the breeding-season, and perform for hours their graceful\r\nevolutions. Large numbers of the Solitary snipe (_Scolopax major_)\r\nassemble during the dusk in a morass; and the same place is frequented\r\nfor the same purpose during successive years; here they may be seen\r\nrunning about “like so many large rats,” puffing out their feathers,\r\nflapping their wings, and uttering the strangest cries.[149]\r\n\r\nSome of the above-mentioned birds, namely, the black-cock, capercailzie,\r\npheasant-grouse, the ruff, the Solitary snipe, and perhaps some others,\r\nare, as it is believed, polygamists. With such birds it might have been\r\nthought that the stronger males would simply have driven away the\r\nweaker, and then at once have taken possession of as many females as\r\npossible; but if it be indispensable for the male to excite or please\r\nthe female, we can understand the length of the courtship and the\r\ncongregation of so many individuals of both sexes at the same spot.\r\nCertain species which are strictly monogamous likewise hold nuptial\r\nassemblages; this seems to be the case in Scandinavia with one of the\r\nptarmigans, and their leks last from the middle of March to the middle\r\nof May. In Australia the lyre-bird or _Menura superba_ forms “small\r\nround hillocks,” and the _M. Alberti_ scratches for itself shallow\r\nholes, or, as they are called by the natives, _corroborying places_,\r\nwhere it is believed both sexes assemble. The meetings of the _M.\r\nsuperba_ are sometimes very large; and an account has lately been\r\npublished[150] by a traveller, who heard in a valley beneath him,\r\nthickly covered with scrub, “a din which completely astonished” him; on\r\ncrawling onwards he beheld to his amazement about one hundred and fifty\r\nof the magnificent lyre-cocks, “ranged in order of battle, and fighting\r\nwith indescribable fury.” The bowers of the Bower-birds are the resort\r\nof both sexes during the breeding-season; and “here the males meet and\r\ncontend with each other for the favours of the female, and here the\r\nlatter assemble and coquet with the males.” With two of the genera, the\r\nsame bower is resorted to during many years.[151]\r\n\r\nThe common magpie (_Corvus pica_, Linn.), as I have been informed by the\r\nRev. W. Darwin Fox, used to assemble from all parts of Delamere Forest,\r\nin order to celebrate the “great magpie marriage.” Some years ago these\r\nbirds abounded in extraordinary numbers, so that a gamekeeper killed in\r\none morning nineteen males, and another killed by a single shot seven\r\nbirds at roost together. Whilst they were so numerous, they had the\r\nhabit very early in the spring of assembling at particular spots, where\r\nthey could be seen in flocks, chattering, sometimes fighting, bustling\r\nand flying about the trees. The whole affair was evidently considered by\r\nthe birds as of the highest importance. Shortly after the meeting they\r\nall separated, and were then observed by Mr. Fox and others to be\r\npaired for the season. In any district in which a species does not exist\r\nin large numbers, great assemblages cannot, of course, be held, and the\r\nsame species may have different habits in different countries. For\r\ninstance, I have never met with any account of regular assemblages of\r\nblack game in Scotland, yet these assemblages are so well known in\r\nGermany and Scandinavia that they have special names.\r\n\r\n_Unpaired Birds._—From the facts now given, we may conclude that with\r\nbirds belonging to widely-different groups their courtship is often a\r\nprolonged, delicate, and troublesome affair. There is even reason to\r\nsuspect, improbable as this will at first appear, that some males and\r\nfemales of the same species, inhabiting the same district, do not always\r\nplease each other and in consequence do not pair. Many accounts have\r\nbeen published of either the male or female of a pair having been shot,\r\nand quickly replaced by another. This has been observed more frequently\r\nwith the magpie than with any other bird, owing perhaps to its\r\nconspicuous appearance and nest. The illustrious Jenner states that in\r\nWiltshire one of a pair was daily shot no less than seven times\r\nsuccessively, “but all to no purpose, for the remaining magpie soon\r\nfound another mate;” and the last pair reared their young. A new partner\r\nis generally found on the succeeding day; but Mr. Thompson gives the\r\ncase of one being replaced on the evening of the same day. Even after\r\nthe eggs are hatched, if one of the old birds is destroyed a mate will\r\noften be found; this occurred after an interval of two days, in a case\r\nrecently observed by one of Sir J. Lubbock’s keepers.[152] The first and\r\nmost obvious conjecture is that male magpies must be much more numerous\r\nthan the females; and that in the above cases, as well in many others\r\nwhich could be given, the males alone had been killed. This apparently\r\nholds good in some instances, for the gamekeepers in Delamere Forest\r\nassured Mr. Fox that the magpies and carrion-crows which they formerly\r\nkilled in succession in large numbers near their nests were all males;\r\nand they accounted for this fact by the males being easily killed whilst\r\nbringing food to the sitting females. Macgillivray, however, gives, on\r\nthe authority of an excellent observer, an instance of three magpies\r\nsuccessively killed on the same nest which were all females; and another\r\ncase of six magpies successively killed whilst sitting on the same eggs,\r\nwhich renders it probable that most of them were females, though the\r\nmale will sit on the eggs, as I hear from Mr. Fox, when the female is\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nSir J. Lubbock’s gamekeeper has repeatedly shot, but how many times he\r\ncould not say, one of a pair of jays (_Garrulus glandarius_), and has\r\nnever failed shortly afterwards to find the survivor rematched. The Rev.\r\nW. D. Fox, Mr. F. Bond, and others, have shot one of a pair of\r\ncarrion-crows (_Corvus corone_), but the nest was soon again tenanted by\r\na pair. These birds are rather common; but the peregrine falcon (_Falco\r\nperegrinus_) is rare, yet Mr. Thompson states that in Ireland “if either\r\nan old male or female be killed in the breeding-season (not an uncommon\r\ncircumstance), another mate is found within a very few days, so that the\r\neyries, notwithstanding such casualties, are sure to turn out their\r\ncomplement of young.” Mr. Jenner Weir has known the same thing to occur\r\nwith the peregrine falcons at Beachy Head. The same observer informs me\r\nthat three kestrels, all males (_Falco tinnunculus_), were killed one\r\nafter the other whilst attending the same nest; two of these were in\r\nmature plumage, and the third in the plumage of the previous year. Even\r\nwith the rare golden eagle (_Aquila chrysaëtos_), Mr. Birkbeck was\r\nassured by a trustworthy gamekeeper in Scotland, that if one is killed,\r\nanother is soon found. So with the white owl (_Strix flammea_), it has\r\nbeen observed that “the survivor readily found a mate, and the mischief\r\nwent on.”\r\n\r\nWhite of Selborne, who gives the case of the owl, adds that he knew a\r\nman, who from believing that partridges when paired were disturbed by\r\nthe males fighting, used to shoot them; and though he had widowed the\r\nsame female several times she was always soon provided with a fresh\r\npartner. This same naturalist ordered the sparrows, which deprived the\r\nhouse-martins of their nests, to be shot: but the one which was left,\r\n“be it cock or hen, presently procured a mate, and so for several times\r\nfollowing.” I could add analogous cases relating to the chaffinch,\r\nnightingale, and redstart. With respect to the latter bird\r\n(_Phœnicura ruticilla_), the writer remarks that it was by no means\r\ncommon in the neighbourhood, and he expresses much surprise how the\r\nsitting female could so soon give effectual notice that she was a widow.\r\nMr. Jenner Weir has mentioned to me a nearly similar case: at Blackheath\r\nhe never sees or hears the note of the wild bullfinch, yet when one of\r\nhis caged males has died, a wild one in the course of a few days has\r\ngenerally come and perched near the widowed female, whose call-note is\r\nfar from loud. I will give only one other fact, on the authority of this\r\nsame observer; one of a pair of starlings (_Sturnus vulgaris_) was shot\r\nin the morning; by noon a new mate was found; this was again shot, but\r\nbefore night the pair was complete; so that the disconsolate widow or\r\nwidower was thrice consoled during the same day. Mr. Engleheart also\r\ninforms me that he used during several years to shoot one of a pair of\r\nstarlings which built in a hole in a house at Blackheath; but the loss\r\nwas always immediately repaired. During one season he kept an account\r\nand found that he had shot thirty-five birds from the same nest; these\r\nconsisted of both males and females, but in what proportion he could not\r\nsay: nevertheless after all this destruction, a brood was reared.[153]\r\n\r\nThese facts are certainly remarkable. How is it that so many birds are\r\nready immediately to replace a lost mate? Magpies, jays, carrion-crows,\r\npartridges, and some other birds, are never seen during the spring by\r\nthemselves, and these offer at first sight the most perplexing case. But\r\nbirds of the same sex, although of course not truly paired, sometimes\r\nlive in pairs or in small parties, as is known to be the case with\r\npigeons and partridges. Birds also sometimes live in triplets, as has\r\nbeen observed with starlings, carrion-crows, parrots, and partridges.\r\nWith partridges two females have been known to live with one male, and\r\ntwo males with one female. In all such cases it is probable that the\r\nunion would be easily broken. The males of certain birds may\r\noccasionally be heard pouring forth their love-song long after the\r\nproper time, shewing that they have either lost or never gained a mate.\r\nDeath from accident or disease of either one of a pair, would leave the\r\nother bird free and single; and there is reason to believe that female\r\nbirds during the breeding-season are especially liable to premature\r\ndeath. Again, birds which have had their nests destroyed, or barren\r\npairs, or retarded individuals, would easily be induced to desert their\r\nmates, and would probably be glad to take what share they could of the\r\npleasures and duties of rearing offspring, although not their own.[154]\r\nSuch contingencies as these probably explain most of the foregoing\r\ncases.[155] Nevertheless it is a strange fact that within the same\r\ndistrict, during the height of the breeding-season, there should be so\r\nmany males and females always ready to repair the loss of a mated bird.\r\nWhy do not such spare birds immediately pair together? Have we not some\r\nreason to suspect, and the suspicion has occurred to Mr. Jenner Weir,\r\nthat inasmuch as the act of courtship appears to be with many birds a\r\nprolonged and tedious affair, so it occasionally happens that certain\r\nmales and females do not succeed during the proper season, in exciting\r\neach other’s love, and consequently do not pair? This suspicion will\r\nappear somewhat less improbable after we have seen what strong\r\nantipathies and preferences female birds occasionally evince towards\r\nparticular males.\r\n\r\n_Mental Qualities of Birds, and their taste for the beautiful._—Before\r\nwe discuss any further the question whether the females select the more\r\nattractive males or accept the first whom they may encounter, it will be\r\nadvisable briefly to consider the mental powers of birds. Their reason\r\nis generally, and perhaps justly, ranked as low; yet some facts could be\r\ngiven[156] leading to an opposite conclusion. Low powers of reasoning,\r\nhowever, are compatible, as we see with mankind, with strong affections,\r\nacute perception, and a taste for the beautiful; and it is with these\r\nlatter qualities that we are here concerned. It has often been said that\r\nparrots become so deeply attached to each other that when one dies the\r\nother for a long time pines; but Mr. Jenner Weir thinks that with most\r\nbirds the strength of their affection has been much exaggerated.\r\nNevertheless when one of a pair in a state of nature has been shot, the\r\nsurvivor has been heard for days afterwards uttering a plaintive call;\r\nand Mr. St. John gives[157] various facts proving the attachment of\r\nmated birds. Starlings, however, as we have seen, may be consoled thrice\r\nin the same day for the loss of their mates. In the Zoological Gardens\r\nparrots have clearly recognised their former masters after an interval\r\nof some months. Pigeons have such excellent local memories that they\r\nhave been known to return to their former homes after an interval of\r\nnine months, yet, as I hear from Mr. Harrison Weir, if a pair which\r\nwould naturally remain mated for life be separated for a few weeks\r\nduring the winter and matched with other birds, the two, when brought\r\ntogether again, rarely, if ever, recognise each other.\r\n\r\nBirds sometimes exhibit benevolent feelings; they will feed the deserted\r\nyoung even of distinct species, but this perhaps ought to be considered\r\nas a mistaken instinct. They will also feed, as shewn in an earlier part\r\nof this work, adult birds of their own species which have become blind.\r\nMr. Buxton gives a curious account of a parrot which took care of a\r\nfrost-bitten and crippled bird of a distinct species, cleansed her\r\nfeathers and defended her from the attacks of the other parrots which\r\nroamed freely about his garden. It is a still more curious fact that\r\nthese birds apparently evince some sympathy for the pleasures of their\r\nfellows. When a pair of cockatoos made a nest in an acacia tree, “it was\r\nridiculous to see the extravagant interest taken in the matter by the\r\nothers of the same species.” These parrots, also, evinced unbounded\r\ncuriosity, and clearly had “the idea of property and possession.”[158]\r\n\r\nBirds possess acute powers of observation. Every mated bird, of course,\r\nrecognises its fellow. Audubon states that with the mocking-thrushes of\r\nthe United States (_Mimus polyglottus_) a certain number remain all the\r\nyear round in Louisiana, whilst the others migrate to the Eastern\r\nStates; these latter, on their return, are instantly recognised, and\r\nalways attacked, by their Southern brethren. Birds under confinement\r\ndistinguish different persons, as is proved by the strong and permanent\r\nantipathy or affection which they shew, without any apparent cause,\r\ntowards certain individuals. I have heard of numerous instances with\r\njays, partridges, canaries, and especially bullfinches. Mr. Hussey has\r\ndescribed in how extraordinary a manner a tamed partridge recognised\r\neverybody; and its likes and dislikes were very strong. This bird seemed\r\n“fond of gay colours, and no new gown or cap could be put on without\r\ncatching his attention.”[159] Mr. Hewitt has carefully described the\r\nhabits of some ducks (recently descended from wild birds), which, at the\r\napproach of a strange dog or cat, would rush headlong into the water,\r\nand exhaust themselves in their attempts to escape; but they knew so\r\nwell Mr. Hewitt’s own dogs and cats that they would lie down and bask in\r\nthe sun close to them. They always moved away from a strange man, and so\r\nthey would from the lady who attended them, if she made any great change\r\nin her dress. Audubon relates that he reared and tamed a wild turkey\r\nwhich always ran away from any strange dog; this bird escaped into the\r\nwoods, and some days afterwards Audubon saw, as he thought, a wild\r\nturkey, and made his dog chase it; but to his astonishment, the bird did\r\nnot run away, and the dog, when he came up, did not attack the bird, for\r\nthey mutually recognised each other as old friends.[160]\r\n\r\nMr. Jenner Weir is convinced that birds pay particular attention to the\r\ncolours of other birds, sometimes out of jealousy, and sometimes as a\r\nsign of kinship. Thus he turned a reed-bunting (_Emberiza\r\nschœniculus_), which had acquired its black head, into his aviary,\r\nand the new-comer was not noticed by any bird, except by a bullfinch,\r\nwhich is likewise black-headed. This bullfinch was a very quiet bird,\r\nand had never before quarrelled with any of its comrades, including\r\nanother reed-bunting, which had not as yet become black-headed: but the\r\nreed-bunting with a black head was so unmercifully treated, that it had\r\nto be removed. Mr. Weir was also obliged to turn out a robin, as it\r\nfiercely attacked all birds with any red in their plumage, but no other\r\nkinds; it actually killed a red-breasted crossbill, and nearly killed a\r\ngoldfinch. On the other hand, he has observed that some birds, when\r\nfirst introduced into his aviary, fly towards the species which resemble\r\nthem most in colour, and settle by their sides.\r\n\r\nAs male birds display with so much care their fine plumage and other\r\nornaments in the presence of the females, it is obviously probable that\r\nthese appreciate the beauty of their suitors. It is, however, difficult\r\nto obtain direct evidence of their capacity to appreciate beauty. When\r\nbirds gaze at themselves in a looking-glass (of which many instances\r\nhave been recorded) we cannot feel sure that it is not from jealousy at\r\na supposed rival, though this is not the conclusion of some observers.\r\nIn other cases it is difficult to distinguish between mere curiosity and\r\nadmiration. It is perhaps the former feeling which, as stated by Lord\r\nLilford,[161] attracts the Ruff strongly towards any bright object, so\r\nthat, in the Ionian Islands, it “will dart down to a bright-coloured\r\nhandkerchief, regardless of repeated shots.” The common lark is drawn\r\ndown from the sky, and is caught in large numbers, by a small mirror\r\nmade to move and glitter in the sun. Is it admiration or curiosity which\r\nleads the magpie, raven, and some other birds to steal and secrete\r\nbright objects, such as silver articles or jewels?\r\n\r\nMr. Gould states that certain humming-birds decorate the outside of\r\ntheir nests, “with the utmost taste; they instinctively fasten thereon\r\nbeautiful pieces of flat lichen, the larger pieces in the middle, and\r\nthe smaller on the part attached to the branch. Now and then a pretty\r\nfeather is intertwined or fastened to the outer sides, the stem being\r\nalways so placed, that the feather stands out beyond the surface.” The\r\nbest evidence, however, of a taste for the beautiful is afforded by the\r\nthree genera of Australian bower-birds already mentioned. Their bowers\r\n(see fig. 46, p. 70), where the sexes congregate and play strange\r\nantics, are differently constructed, but what most concerns us is, that\r\nthey are decorated in a different manner by the several species. The\r\nSatin bower-bird collects gaily-coloured articles, such as the blue\r\ntail-feathers of parrakeets, bleached bones and shells, which it sticks\r\nbetween the twigs, or arranges at the entrance. Mr. Gould found in one\r\nbower a neatly-worked stone tomahawk and a slip of blue cotton,\r\nevidently procured from a native encampment. These objects are\r\ncontinually rearranged, and carried about by the birds whilst at play.\r\nThe bower of the Spotted bower-bird “is beautifully lined with tall\r\ngrasses, so disposed that the heads nearly meet, and the decorations are\r\nvery profuse.” Round stones are used to keep the grass-stems in their\r\nproper places, and to make divergent paths leading to the bower. The\r\nstones and shells are often brought from a great distance. The Regent\r\nbird, as described by Mr. Ramsay, ornaments its short bower with\r\nbleached land-shells belonging to five or six species, and with “berries\r\nof various colours, blue, red, and black, which give it when fresh a\r\nvery pretty appearance. Besides these there were several newly-picked\r\nleaves and young shoots of a pinkish colour, the whole shewing a decided\r\ntaste for the beautiful.” Well may Mr. Gould say “these highly decorated\r\nhalls of assembly must be regarded as the most wonderful instances of\r\nbird-architecture yet discovered;” and the taste, as we see, of the\r\nseveral species certainly differs.[162]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preference for particular Males by the Females._—Having made these\r\npreliminary remarks on the discrimination and taste of birds, I will\r\ngive all the facts known to me, which bear on the preference shewn by\r\nthe female for particular males. It is certain that distinct species of\r\nbirds occasionally pair in a state of nature and produce hybrids. Many\r\ninstances could be given: thus Macgillivray relates how a male blackbird\r\nand female thrush “fell in love with each other,” and produced\r\noffspring.[163] Several years ago eighteen cases had been recorded of\r\nthe occurrence in Great Britain of hybrids between the black grouse and\r\npheasant;[164] but most of these cases may perhaps be accounted for by\r\nsolitary birds not finding one of their own species to pair with. With\r\nother birds, as Mr. Jenner Weir has reason to believe, hybrids are\r\nsometimes the result of the casual intercourse of birds building in\r\nclose proximity. But these remarks do not apply to the many recorded\r\ninstances of tamed or domestic birds, belonging to distinct species,\r\nwhich have become absolutely fascinated with each other, although living\r\nwith their own species. Thus Waterton[165] states that out of a flock of\r\ntwenty-three Canada geese, a female paired with a solitary Bernicle\r\ngander, although so different in appearance and size; and they produced\r\nhybrid offspring. A male Wigeon (_Mareca penelope_), living with females\r\nof the same species, has been known to pair with a Pintail duck,\r\n_Querquedula acuta_. Lloyd describes the remarkable attachment between a\r\nshield-drake (_Tadorna vulpanser_) and a common duck. Many additional\r\ninstances could be given; and the Rev. E. S. Dixon remarks that “Those\r\nwho have kept many different species of geese together, well know what\r\nunaccountable attachments they are frequently forming, and that they are\r\nquite as likely to pair and rear young with individuals of a race\r\n(species) apparently the most alien to themselves, as with their own\r\nstock.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. D. Fox informs me that he possessed at the same time a pair\r\nof Chinese geese (_Anser cygnoides_), and a common gander with three\r\ngeese. The two lots kept quite separate, until the Chinese gander\r\nseduced one of the common geese to live with him. Moreover, of the young\r\nbirds hatched from the eggs of the common geese, only four were pure,\r\nthe other eighteen proving hybrids; so that the Chinese gander seems to\r\nhave had prepotent charms over the common gander. I will give only one\r\nother case; Mr. Hewitt states that a wild duck, reared in captivity,\r\n“after breeding a couple of seasons with her own mallard, at once shook\r\nhim off on my placing a male Pintail on the water. It was evidently a\r\ncase of love at first sight, for she swam about the new-comer\r\ncaressingly, though he appeared evidently alarmed and averse to her\r\novertures of affection. From that hour she forgot her old partner.\r\nWinter passed by, and the next spring the Pintail seemed to have become\r\na convert to her blandishments, for they nested and produced seven or\r\neight young ones.”\r\n\r\nWhat the charm may have been in these several cases, beyond mere\r\nnovelty, we cannot even conjecture. Colour, however, sometimes comes\r\ninto play; for in order to raise hybrids from the siskin (_Fringilla\r\nspinus_) and the canary, it is much the best plan, according to\r\nBechstein, to place birds of the same tint together. Mr. Jenner Weir\r\nturned a female canary into his aviary, where there were male linnets,\r\ngoldfinches, siskins, greenfinches, chaffinches, and other birds, in\r\norder to see which she would choose; but there never was any doubt, and\r\nthe greenfinch carried the day. They paired and produced hybrid\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nWith the members of the same species the fact of the female preferring\r\nto pair with one male rather than with another is not so likely to\r\nexcite attention, as when this occurs between distinct species. Such\r\ncases can best be observed with domesticated or confined birds; but\r\nthese are often pampered by high feeding, and sometimes have their\r\ninstincts vitiated to an extreme degree. Of this latter fact I could\r\ngive sufficient proofs with pigeons, and especially with fowls, but they\r\ncannot be here related. Vitiated instincts may also account for some of\r\nthe hybrid unions above referred to; but in many of these cases the\r\nbirds were allowed to range freely over large ponds, and there is no\r\nreason to suppose that they were unnaturally stimulated by high feeding.\r\n\r\nWith respect to birds in a state of nature, the first and most obvious\r\nsupposition which will occur to everyone is that the female at the\r\nproper season accepts the first male whom she may encounter; but she has\r\nat least the opportunity for exerting a choice, as she is almost\r\ninvariably pursued by many males. Audubon—and we must remember that he\r\nspent a long life in prowling about the forests of the United States and\r\nobserving the birds—does not doubt that the female deliberately chooses\r\nher mate; thus, speaking of a woodpecker, he says the hen is followed by\r\nhalf-a-dozen gay suitors, who continue performing strange antics, “until\r\na marked preference is shewn for one.” The female of the red-winged\r\nstarling (_Agelæus phœniceus_) is likewise pursued by several males,\r\n“until, becoming fatigued, she alights, receives their addresses, and\r\nsoon makes a choice.” He describes also how several male nightjars\r\nrepeatedly plunge through the air with astonishing rapidity, suddenly\r\nturning, and thus making a singular noise; “but no sooner has the female\r\nmade her choice, than the other males are driven away.” With one of the\r\nvultures (_Cathartes aura_) of the United States, parties of eight or\r\nten or more males and females assemble on fallen logs, “exhibiting the\r\nstrongest desire to please mutually,” and after many caresses, each male\r\nleads off his partner on the wing. Audubon likewise carefully observed\r\nthe wild flocks of Canada geese (_Anser Canadensis_), and gives a\r\ngraphic description of their love-antics; he says that the birds which\r\nhad been previously mated “renewed their courtship as early as the month\r\nof January, while the others would be contending or coquetting for\r\nhours every day, until all seemed satisfied with the choice they had\r\nmade, after which, although they remained together, any person could\r\neasily perceive that they were careful to keep in pairs. I have observed\r\nalso that the older the birds, the shorter were the preliminaries of\r\ntheir courtship. The bachelors and old maids, whether in regret, or not\r\ncaring to be disturbed by the bustle, quietly moved aside and lay down\r\nat some distance from the rest.”[166] Many similar statements with\r\nrespect to other birds could be cited from this same observer.\r\n\r\nTurning now to domesticated and confined birds, I will commence by\r\ngiving what little I have learnt respecting the courtship of fowls. I\r\nhave received long letters on this subject from Messrs. Hewitt and\r\nTegetmeier, and almost an essay from the late Mr. Brent. It will be\r\nadmitted by every one that these gentlemen, so well known from their\r\npublished works, are careful and experienced observers. They do not\r\nbelieve that the females prefer certain males on account of the beauty\r\nof their plumage; but some allowance must be made for the artificial\r\nstate under which they have long been kept. Mr. Tegetmeier is convinced\r\nthat a game-cock, though disfigured by being dubbed with his hackles\r\ntrimmed, would be accepted as readily as a male retaining all his\r\nnatural ornaments. Mr. Brent, however, admits that the beauty of the\r\nmale probably aids in exciting the female; and her acquiescence is\r\nnecessary. Mr. Hewitt is convinced that the union is by no means left to\r\nmere chance, for the female almost invariably prefers the most vigorous,\r\ndefiant, and mettlesome male; hence it is almost useless, as he remarks,\r\n“to attempt true breeding if a game-cock in good health and condition\r\nruns the locality, for almost every hen on leaving the roosting-place\r\nwill resort to the game-cock, even though that bird may not actually\r\ndrive away the male of her own variety.” Under ordinary circumstances\r\nthe males and females of the fowl seem to come to a mutual understanding\r\nby means of certain gestures, described to me by Mr. Brent. But hens\r\nwill often avoid the officious attentions of young males. Old hens, and\r\nhens of a pugnacious disposition, as the same writer informs me, dislike\r\nstrange males, and will not yield until well beaten into compliance.\r\nFerguson, however, describes how a quarrelsome hen was subdued by the\r\ngentle courtship of a Shanghai cock.[167]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that pigeons of both sexes prefer pairing\r\nwith birds of the same breed; and dovecot-pigeons dislike all the highly\r\nimproved breeds.[168] Mr. Harrison Weir has lately heard from a\r\ntrustworthy observer, who keeps blue pigeons, that these drive away all\r\nother coloured varieties, such as white, red, and yellow; and from\r\nanother observer, that a female dun carrier could not be matched, after\r\nrepeated trials, with a black male, but immediately paired with a dun.\r\nGenerally colour alone appears to have little influence on the pairing\r\nof pigeons. Mr. Tegetmeier, at my request, stained some of his birds\r\nwith magenta, but they were not much noticed by the others.\r\n\r\nFemale pigeons occasionally feel a strong antipathy towards certain\r\nmales, without any assignable cause. Thus MM. Boitard and Corbié, whose\r\nexperience extended over forty-five years, state: “Quand une femelle\r\néprouve de l’antipathie pour un mâle avec lequel on veut l’accoupler,\r\nmalgré tous les feux de l’amour, malgré l’alpiste et le chènevis dont on\r\nla nourrit pour augmenter son ardeur, malgré un emprisonnement de six\r\nmois et même d’un an, elle refuse constamment ses caresses; les avances\r\nempressées, les agaceries, les tournoiemens, les tendres roucoulemens,\r\nrien ne peut lui plaire ni l’émouvoir; gonflée, boudeuse, blottie dans\r\nun coin de sa prison, elle n’en sort que pour boire et manger, ou pour\r\nrepousser avec une espèce de rage des caresses devenues trop\r\npressantes.”[169] On the other hand, Mr. Harrison Weir has himself\r\nobserved, and has heard from, several breeders, that a female pigeon\r\nwill occasionally take a strong fancy for a particular male, and will\r\ndesert her own mate for him. Some females, according to another\r\nexperienced observer, Riedel,[170] are of a profligate disposition, and\r\nprefer almost any stranger to their own mate. Some amorous males, called\r\nby our English fanciers “gay birds,” are so successful in their\r\ngallantries, that, as Mr. H. Weir informs me, they must be shut up, on\r\naccount of the mischief which they cause.\r\n\r\nWild turkeys in the United States, according to Audubon, “sometimes pay\r\ntheir addresses to the domesticated females, and are generally received\r\nby them with great pleasure.” So that these females apparently prefer\r\nthe wild to their own males.[171]\r\n\r\nHere is a more curious case. Sir R. Heron during many years kept an\r\naccount of the habits of the peafowl, which he bred in large numbers. He\r\nstates that “the hens have frequently great preference to a particular\r\npeacock. They were all so fond of an old pied cock, that one year, when\r\nhe was confined though still in view, they were constantly assembled\r\nclose to the trellice-walls of his prison, and would not suffer a\r\njapanned peacock to touch them. On his being let out in the autumn, the\r\noldest of the hens instantly courted him, and was successful in her\r\ncourtship. The next year he was shut up in a stable, and then the hens\r\nall courted his rival.”[172] This rival was a japanned or black-winged\r\npeacock, which to our eyes is a more beautiful bird than the common\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nLichtenstein, who was a good observer and had excellent opportunities of\r\nobservation at the Cape of Good Hope, assured Rudolphi that the female\r\nwidow-bird (_Chera progne_) disowns the male, when robbed of the long\r\ntail-feathers with which he is ornamented during the breeding-season. I\r\npresume that this observation must have been made on birds under\r\nconfinement.[173] Here is another striking case; Dr. Jaeger,[174]\r\ndirector of the Zoological Gardens of Vienna, states that a male\r\nsilver pheasant, who had been triumphant over the other males and was\r\nthe accepted lover of the females, had his ornamental plumage spoiled.\r\nHe was then immediately superseded by a rival, who got the upper hand\r\nand afterwards led the flock.\r\n\r\nNot only does the female exert a choice, but in some few cases she\r\ncourts the male, or even fights for his possession. Sir R. Heron states\r\nthat with peafowl, the first advances are always made by the female;\r\nsomething of the same kind takes place, according to Audubon, with the\r\nolder females of the wild turkey. With the capercailzie, the females\r\nflit round the male, whilst he is parading at one of the places of\r\nassemblage, and solicit his attention.[175] We have seen that a tame\r\nwild-duck seduced after a long courtship an unwilling Pintail drake. Mr.\r\nBartlett believes that the Lophophorus, like many other gallinaceous\r\nbirds, is naturally polygamous, but two females cannot be placed in the\r\nsame cage with a male, as they fight so much together. The following\r\ninstance of rivalry is more surprising as it relates to bullfinches,\r\nwhich usually pair for life. Mr. Jenner Weir introduced a dull-coloured\r\nand ugly female into his aviary, and she immediately attacked another\r\nmated female so unmercifully that the latter had to be separated. The\r\nnew female did all the courtship, and was at last successful, for she\r\npaired with the male; but after a time she met with a just retribution,\r\nfor, ceasing to be pugnacious, Mr. Weir replaced the old female, and the\r\nmale then deserted his new and returned to his old love.\r\n\r\nIn all ordinary cases the male is so eager that he will accept any\r\nfemale, and does not, as far as we can judge, prefer one to the other;\r\nbut exceptions to this rule, as we shall hereafter see, apparently occur\r\nin some few groups. With domesticated birds, I have heard of only one\r\ncase in which the males shew any preference for particular females,\r\nnamely, that of the domestic cock, who, according to the high authority\r\nof Mr. Hewitt, prefers the younger to the older hens. On the other\r\nhand, in effecting hybrid unions between the male pheasant and common\r\nhens, Mr. Hewitt is convinced that the pheasant invariably prefers the\r\nolder birds. He does not appear to be in the least influenced by their\r\ncolour, but “is most capricious in his attachments.”[176] From some\r\ninexplicable cause he shews the most determined aversion to certain\r\nhens, which no care on the part of the breeder can overcome. Some hens,\r\nas Mr. Hewitt informs me, are quite unattractive even to the males of\r\ntheir own species, so that they may be kept with several cocks during a\r\nwhole season, and not one egg out of forty or fifty will prove fertile.\r\nOn the other hand with the Long-tailed duck (_Harelda glacialis_), “it\r\nhas been remarked,” says M. Ekström, “that certain females are much more\r\ncourted than the rest. Frequently, indeed, one sees an individual\r\nsurrounded by six or eight amorous males.” Whether this statement is\r\ncredible, I know not; but the native sportsmen shoot these females in\r\norder to stuff them as decoys.[177]\r\n\r\nWith respect to female birds feeling a preference for particular males,\r\nwe must bear in mind that we can judge of choice being exerted, only by\r\nplacing ourselves in imagination in the same position. If an inhabitant\r\nof another planet were to behold a number of young rustics at a fair,\r\ncourting and quarrelling over a pretty girl, like birds at one of their\r\nplaces of assemblage, he would be able to infer that she had the power\r\nof choice only by observing the eagerness of the wooers to please her,\r\nand to display their finery. Now with birds, the evidence stands thus;\r\nthey have acute powers of observation, and they seem to have some taste\r\nfor the beautiful both in colour and sound. It is certain that the\r\nfemales occasionally exhibit, from unknown causes, the strongest\r\nantipathies and preferences for particular males. When the sexes differ\r\nin colour or in other ornaments, the males with rare exceptions are the\r\nmost highly decorated, either permanently or temporarily during the\r\nbreeding-season. They sedulously display their various ornaments, exert\r\ntheir voices, and perform strange antics in the presence of the females.\r\nEven well-armed males, who, it might have been thought, would have\r\naltogether depended for success on the law of battle, are in most cases\r\nhighly ornamented; and their ornaments have been acquired at the expense\r\nof some loss of power. In other cases ornaments have been acquired, at\r\nthe cost of increased risk from birds and beasts of prey. With various\r\nspecies many individuals of both sexes congregate at the same spot, and\r\ntheir courtship is a prolonged affair. There is even reason to suspect\r\nthat the males and females within the same district do not always\r\nsucceed in pleasing each other and pairing.\r\n\r\nWhat then are we to conclude from these facts and considerations? Does\r\nthe male parade his charms with so much pomp and rivalry for no purpose?\r\nAre we not justified in believing that the female exerts a choice, and\r\nthat she receives the addresses of the male who pleases her most? It is\r\nnot probable that she consciously deliberates; but she is most excited\r\nor attracted by the most beautiful, or melodious, or gallant males. Nor\r\nneed it be supposed that the female studies each stripe or spot of\r\ncolour; that the peahen, for instance, admires each detail in the\r\ngorgeous train of the peacock—she is probably struck only by the\r\ngeneral effect. Nevertheless after hearing how carefully the male Argus\r\npheasant displays his elegant primary wing-feathers, and erects his\r\nocellated plumes in the right position for their full effect; or again,\r\nhow the male goldfinch alternately displays his gold-bespangled wings,\r\nwe ought not to feel too sure that the female does not attend to each\r\ndetail of beauty. We can judge, as already remarked, of choice being\r\nexerted, only from the analogy of our own minds; and the mental powers\r\nof birds, if reason be excluded, do not fundamentally differ from ours.\r\nFrom these various considerations we may conclude that the pairing of\r\nbirds is not left to chance; but that those males, which are best able\r\nby their various charms to please or excite the female, are under\r\nordinary circumstances accepted. If this be admitted, there is not much\r\ndifficulty in understanding how male birds have gradually acquired their\r\nornamental characters. All animals present individual differences, and\r\nas man can modify his domesticated birds by selecting the individuals\r\nwhich appear to him the most beautiful, so the habitual or even\r\noccasional preference by the female of the more attractive males would\r\nalmost certainly lead to their modification; and such modifications\r\nmight in the course of time be augmented to almost any extent,\r\ncompatible with the existence of the species.\r\n\r\n_Variability of Birds, and especially of their secondary Sexual\r\nCharacters._—Variability and inheritance are the foundations for the\r\nwork of selection. That domesticated birds have varied greatly, their\r\nvariations being inherited, is certain. That birds in a state of nature\r\npresent individual differences is admitted by every one; and that they\r\nhave sometimes been modified into distinct races, is generally\r\nadmitted.[178] Variations are of two kinds, which insensibly graduate\r\ninto each other, namely, slight differences between all the members of\r\nthe same species, and more strongly-marked deviations which occur only\r\noccasionally. These latter are rare with birds in a state of nature, and\r\nit is very doubtful whether they have often been preserved through\r\nselection, and then transmitted to succeeding generations.[179]\r\nNevertheless, it may be worth while to give the few cases relating\r\nchiefly to colour (simple albinism and melanism being excluded), which I\r\nhave been able to collect.\r\n\r\nMr. Gould is well known rarely to admit the existence of varieties, for\r\nhe esteems very slight differences as specific; now he states[180] that\r\nnear Bogota certain humming-birds belonging to the genus Cynanthus are\r\ndivided into two or three races or varieties, which differ from each\r\nother in the colouring of the tail,—“some having the whole of the\r\nfeathers blue, while others have the eight central ones tipped with\r\nbeautiful green.” It does not appear that intermediate gradations have\r\nbeen observed in this or the following cases. In the males alone of one\r\nof the Australian parrakeets “the thighs in some are scarlet, in others\r\ngrass-green.” In another parrakeet of the same country “some individuals\r\nhave the band across the wing-coverts bright-yellow, while in others the\r\nsame part is tinged with red.”[181] In the United States some few of the\r\nmales of the Scarlet Tanager (_Tanagra rubra_) have “a beautiful\r\ntransverse band of glowing red on the smaller wing-coverts;”[182] but\r\nthis variation seems to be somewhat rare, so that its preservation\r\nthrough sexual selection would follow only under unusually favourable\r\ncircumstances. In Bengal the Honey buzzard (_Pernis cristata_) has\r\neither a small rudimental crest on its head, or none at all; so slight a\r\ndifference however would not have been worth notice, had not this same\r\nspecies possessed in Southern India “a well-marked occipital crest\r\nformed of several graduated feathers.”[183]\r\n\r\nThe following case is in some respects more interesting. A pied variety\r\nof the raven, with the head, breast, abdomen, and parts of the wings and\r\ntail-feathers white, is confined to the Feroe Islands. It is not very\r\nrare there, for Graba saw during his visit from eight to ten living\r\nspecimens. Although the characters of this variety are not quite\r\nconstant, yet it has been named by several distinguished ornithologists\r\nas a distinct species. The fact of the pied birds being pursued and\r\npersecuted with much clamour by the other ravens of the island was the\r\nchief cause which led Brünnich to conclude that it was specifically\r\ndistinct; but this is now known to be an error.[184]\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the northern seas a remarkable variety of the common\r\nGuillemot (_Uria troile_) is found; and in Feroe, one out of every five\r\nbirds, according to Graba’s estimation, consists of this variety. It is\r\ncharacterised[185] by a pure white ring round the eye, with a curved\r\nnarrow white line, an inch and a half in length, extending back from the\r\nring. This conspicuous character has caused the bird to be ranked by\r\nseveral ornithologists as a distinct species under the name of _U.\r\nlacrymans_, but it is now known to be merely a variety. It often pairs\r\nwith the common kind, yet intermediate gradations have never been seen;\r\nnor is this surprising, for variations which appear suddenly are often,\r\nas I have elsewhere shewn,[186] transmitted either unaltered or not at\r\nall. We thus see that two distinct forms of the same species may\r\nco-exist in the same district, and we cannot doubt that if the one had\r\npossessed any great advantage over the other, it would soon have been\r\nmultiplied to the exclusion of the latter. If, for instance, the male\r\npied ravens, instead of being persecuted and driven away by their\r\ncomrades, had been highly attractive, like the pied peacock before\r\nmentioned, to the common black females, their numbers would have rapidly\r\nincreased. And this would have been a case of sexual selection.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the slight individual differences which are common, in\r\na greater or less degree, to all the members of the same species, we\r\nhave every reason to believe that they are by far the most important for\r\nthe work of selection. Secondary sexual characters are eminently liable\r\nto vary, both with animals in a state of nature and under\r\ndomestication.[187] There is also reason to believe, as we have seen in\r\nour eighth chapter, that variations are more apt to occur in the male\r\nthan in the female sex. All these contingencies are highly favourable\r\nfor sexual selection. Whether characters thus acquired are transmitted\r\nto one sex or to both sexes, depends exclusively in most cases, as I\r\nhope to shew in the following chapter, on the form of inheritance which\r\nprevails in the groups in question.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes difficult to form any opinion whether certain slight\r\ndifferences between the sexes of birds are simply the result of\r\nvariability with sexually-limited inheritance, without the aid of sexual\r\nselection, or whether they have been augmented through this latter\r\nprocess. I do not here refer to the innumerable instances in which the\r\nmale displays splendid colours or other ornaments, of which the female\r\npartakes only to a slight degree; for these cases are almost certainly\r\ndue to characters primarily acquired by the male, having been\r\ntransferred, in a greater or less degree, to the female. But what are we\r\nto conclude with respect to certain birds in which, for instance, the\r\neyes differ slightly in colour in the two sexes?[188] In some cases the\r\neyes differ conspicuously; thus with the storks of the genus\r\n_Xenorhynchus_ those of the male are blackish-hazel, whilst those of the\r\nfemales are gamboge-yellow; with many hornbills (Buceros), as I hear\r\nfrom Mr. Blyth,[189] the males have intense crimson, and the females\r\nwhite eyes. In the _Buceros bicornis_, the hind margin of the casque and\r\na stripe on the crest of the beak are black in the male, but not so in\r\nthe female. Are we to suppose that these black marks and the crimson\r\ncolour of the eyes have been preserved or augmented through sexual\r\nselection in the males? This is very doubtful; for Mr. Bartlett shewed\r\nme in the Zoological Gardens that the inside of the mouth of this\r\nBuceros is black in the male and flesh-coloured in the female; and their\r\nexternal appearance or beauty would not be thus affected. I observed in\r\nChili[190] that the iris in the condor, when about a year old, is\r\ndark-brown, but changes at maturity into yellowish-brown in the male,\r\nand into bright red in the female. The male has also a small,\r\nlongitudinal, leaden-coloured, fleshy crest or comb. With many\r\ngallinaceous birds the comb is highly ornamental, and assumes vivid\r\ncolours during the act of courtship; but what are we to think of the\r\ndull-coloured comb of the condor, which does not appear to us in the\r\nleast ornamental? The same question may be asked in regard to various\r\nother characters, such as the knob on the base of the beak of the\r\nChinese goose (_Anser cygnoides_), which is much larger in the male than\r\nin the female. No certain answer can be given to these questions; but we\r\nought to be cautious in assuming that knobs and various fleshy\r\nappendages cannot be attractive to the female, when we remember that\r\nwith savage races of man various hideous deformities—deep scars on the\r\nface with the flesh raised into protuberances, the septum of the nose\r\npierced by sticks or bones, holes in the ears and lips stretched widely\r\nopen—are all admired as ornamental.\r\n\r\nWhether or not unimportant differences between the sexes, such as those\r\njust specified, have been preserved through sexual selection, these\r\ndifferences, as well as all others, must primarily depend on the laws of\r\nvariation. On the principle of correlated development, the plumage often\r\nvaries on different parts of the body, or over the whole body, in the\r\nsame manner. We see this well illustrated in certain breeds of the fowl.\r\nIn all the breeds the feathers on the neck and loins of the males are\r\nelongated, and are called hackles; now when both sexes acquire a\r\ntop-knot, which is a new character in the genus, the feathers on the\r\nhead of the male become hackle-shaped, evidently on the principle of\r\ncorrelation; whilst those on the head of the female are of the ordinary\r\nshape. The colour also of the hackles forming the top-knot of the male,\r\nis often correlated with that of the hackles on the neck and loins, as\r\nmay be seen by comparing these feathers in the Golden and\r\nSilver-spangled Polish, the Houdans, and Crève-cœur breeds. In some\r\nnatural species we may observe exactly the same correlation in the\r\ncolours of these same feathers, as in the males of the splendid Golden\r\nand Amherst pheasants.\r\n\r\nThe structure of each individual feather generally causes any change in\r\nits colouring to be symmetrical; we see this in the various laced,\r\nspangled, and pencilled breeds of the fowl; and on the principle of\r\ncorrelation the feathers over the whole body are often modified in the\r\nsame manner. We are thus enabled without much trouble to rear breeds\r\nwith their plumage marked and coloured almost as symmetrically as in\r\nnatural species. In laced and spangled fowls the coloured margins of the\r\nfeathers are abruptly defined; but in a mongrel raised by me from a\r\nblack Spanish cock glossed with green and a white game hen, all the\r\nfeathers were greenish-black, excepting towards their extremities, which\r\nwere yellowish-white; but between the white extremities and the black\r\nbases, there was on each feather a symmetrical, curved zone of\r\ndark-brown. In some instances the shaft of the feather determines the\r\ndistribution of the tints; thus with the body-feathers of a mongrel from\r\nthe same black Spanish cock and a silver-spangled Polish hen, the shaft,\r\ntogether with a narrow space on each side, was greenish-black, and this\r\nwas surrounded by a regular zone of dark-brown, edged with\r\nbrownish-white. In these cases we see feathers becoming symmetrically\r\nshaded, like those which give so much elegance to the plumage of many\r\nnatural species. I have also noticed a variety of the common pigeon with\r\nthe wing-bars symmetrically zoned with three bright shades, instead of\r\nbeing simply black on a slaty-blue ground, as in the parent-species.\r\n\r\nIn many large groups of birds it may be observed that the plumage is\r\ndifferently coloured in each species, yet that certain spots, marks, or\r\nstripes, though likewise differently coloured, are retained by all the\r\nspecies. Analogous cases occur with the breeds of the pigeon, which\r\nusually retain the two wing-bars, though they may be coloured red,\r\nyellow, white, black, or blue, the rest of the plumage being of some\r\nwholly different tint. Here is a more curious case, in which certain\r\nmarks are retained, though coloured in almost an exactly reversed manner\r\nto what is natural; the aboriginal pigeon has a blue tail, with the\r\nterminal halves of the outer webs of the two outer tail-feathers white;\r\nnow there is a sub-variety having a white instead of a blue tail,\r\nwith precisely that small part black which is white in the\r\nparent-species.[191]\r\n\r\n_Formation and variability of the Ocelli or eye-like Spots on the\r\nPlumage of Birds._—As no ornaments are more beautiful than the ocelli\r\non the feathers of various birds, on the hairy coats of some mammals, on\r\nthe scales of reptiles and fishes, on the skin of amphibians, on the\r\nwings of many Lepidoptera and other insects, they deserve to be\r\nespecially noticed. An ocellus consists of a spot within a ring of\r\nanother colour, like the pupil within the iris, but the central spot is\r\noften surrounded by additional concentric zones. The ocelli on the\r\ntail-coverts of the peacock offer a familiar example, as well as those\r\non the wings of the peacock-butterfly (Vanessa). Mr. Trimen has given me\r\na description of a S. African moth (_Gynanisa Isis_), allied to our\r\nEmperor moth, in which a magnificent ocellus occupies nearly the whole\r\nsurface of each hinder wing; it consists of a black centre, including a\r\nsemi-transparent crescent-shaped mark, surrounded by successive\r\nochre-yellow, black, ochre-yellow, pink, white, pink, brown, and whitish\r\nzones. Although we do not know the steps by which these wonderfully\r\nbeautiful and complex ornaments have been developed, the process at\r\nleast with insects has probably been a simple one; for, as Mr. Trimen\r\nwrites to me, “no characters of mere marking or coloration are so\r\nunstable in the Lepidoptera as the ocelli, both in number and size.” Mr.\r\nWallace, who first called my attention to this subject, shewed me a\r\nseries of specimens of our common meadow-brown butterfly (_Hipparchia\r\nJanira_) exhibiting numerous gradations from a simple minute black spot\r\nto an elegantly-shaded ocellus. In a S. African butterfly (_Cyllo Leda_)\r\nbelonging to the same family, the ocelli are even still more variable.\r\nIn some specimens (A, fig. 52) large spaces on the upper surface of the\r\nwings are coloured black, and include irregular white marks; and from\r\nthis state a complete gradation can be traced into a tolerably perfect\r\n(A¹) ocellus, and this results from the contraction of the irregular\r\nblotches of colour. In another series of specimens a gradation can be\r\nfollowed from excessively minute white dots, surrounded by a scarcely\r\nvisible black line (B), into perfectly symmetrical and large ocelli\r\n(B¹).[192] In cases like these, the development of a perfect ocellus\r\ndoes not require a long course of variation and selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. Cyllo leda, Linn., from a drawing by Mr. Trimen,\r\nshewing the extreme range of variation in the ocelli.\r\n\r\nA. Specimen, from Mauritius, upper     B. Specimen, from Java, upper\r\n     surface of fore-wing.                   surface of hind-wing.\r\n\r\nA¹. Specimen, from Natal, ditto.      B¹. Specimen, from Mauritius,\r\n                                              ditto.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith birds and many other animals it seems, from the comparison of\r\nallied species, to follow, that circular spots are often generated by\r\nthe breaking up and contraction of stripes. In the Tragopan pheasant\r\nfaint white lines in the female represent the beautiful white spots in\r\nthe male;[193] and something of the same kind may be observed in the two\r\nsexes of the Argus pheasant. However this may be, appearances strongly\r\nfavour the belief that, on the one hand, a dark spot is often formed by\r\nthe colouring-matter being drawn towards a central point from a\r\nsurrounding zone, which is thus rendered lighter. And, on the other\r\nhand, that a white spot is often formed by the colour being driven away\r\nfrom a central point, so that it accumulates in a surrounding darker\r\nzone. In either case an ocellus is the result. The colouring matter\r\nseems to be a nearly constant quantity, but is redistributed, either\r\ncentripetally or centrifugally. The feathers of the common guinea-fowl\r\noffer a good instance of white spots surrounded by darker zones; and\r\nwherever the white spots are large and stand near each other, the\r\nsurrounding dark zones become confluent. In the same wing-feather of the\r\nArgus pheasant dark spots may be seen surrounded by a pale zone, and\r\nwhite spots by a dark zone. Thus the formation of an ocellus in its\r\nsimplest state appears to be a simple affair. By what further steps the\r\nmore complex ocelli, which are surrounded by many successive zones of\r\ncolour, have been generated, I will not pretend to say. But bearing\r\nin mind the zoned feathers of the mongrel offspring from\r\ndifferently-coloured fowls, and the extraordinary variability of the\r\nocelli in many Lepidoptera, the formation of these beautiful ornaments\r\ncan hardly be a highly complex process, and probably depends on some\r\nslight and graduated change in the nature of the tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gradation of Secondary Sexual Characters._—Cases of gradation are\r\nimportant for us, as they shew that it is at least possible that highly\r\ncomplex ornaments may have been acquired by small successive steps. In\r\norder to discover the actual steps by which the male of any existing\r\nbird has acquired his magnificent colours or other ornaments, we ought\r\nto behold the long line of his ancient and extinct progenitors; but this\r\nis obviously impossible. We may, however, generally gain a clue by\r\ncomparing all the species of a group, if it be a large one; for some of\r\nthem will probably retain, at least in a partial manner, traces of their\r\nformer characters. Instead of entering on tedious details respecting\r\nvarious groups, in which striking instances of gradation could be given,\r\nit seems the best plan to take some one or two strongly-characterised\r\ncases, for instance that of the peacock, in order to discover if any\r\nlight can thus be thrown on the steps by which this bird has become so\r\nsplendidly decorated. The peacock is chiefly remarkable from the\r\nextraordinary length of his tail-coverts; the tail itself not being much\r\nelongated. The barbs along nearly the whole length of these feathers\r\nstand separate or are decomposed; but this is the case with the feathers\r\nof many species, and with some varieties of the domestic fowl and\r\npigeon. The barbs coalesce towards the extremity of the shaft to form\r\nthe oval disc or ocellus, which is certainly one of the most beautiful\r\nobjects in the world. This consists of an iridescent, intensely blue,\r\nindented centre, surrounded by a rich green zone, and this by a broad\r\ncoppery-brown zone, and this by five other narrow zones of\r\nslightly-different iridescent shades. A trifling character in the disc\r\nperhaps deserves notice; the barbs, for a space along one of the\r\nconcentric zones are destitute, to a greater or less degree, of their\r\nbarbules, so that a part of the disc is surrounded by an almost\r\ntransparent zone, which gives to it a highly-finished aspect. But I have\r\nelsewhere described[194] an exactly analogous variation in the hackles\r\nof a sub-variety of the game-cock, in which the tips, having a metallic\r\nlustre, “are separated from the lower part of the feather by a\r\nsymmetrically-shaped transparent zone, composed of the naked portions of\r\nthe barbs.” The lower margin or base of the dark-blue centre of the\r\nocellus is deeply indented on the line of the shaft. The surrounding\r\nzones likewise shew traces, as may be seen in the drawing (fig. 53), of\r\nindentations, or rather breaks. These indentations are common to the\r\nIndian and Javan peacocks (_Pavo cristatus_ and _P. muticus_); and they\r\nseemed to me to deserve particular attention, as probably connected with\r\nthe development of the ocellus; but for a long time I could not\r\nconjecture their meaning.\r\n\r\nIf we admit the principle of gradual evolution, there must formerly have\r\nexisted many species which presented every successive step between the\r\nwonderfully elongated tail-coverts of the peacock and the short tail\r\ncoverts of all ordinary birds; and again between the magnificent ocelli\r\nof the former, and the simpler ocelli or mere coloured spots of other\r\nbirds; and so with all the other characters of the peacock. Let us look\r\nto the allied Gallinaceæ for any still-existing gradations. The species\r\nand sub-species of Polyplectron inhabit countries adjacent to the native\r\nland of the peacock; and they so far resemble this bird that they are\r\nsometimes called peacock-pheasants. I am also informed by Mr. Bartlett\r\nthat they resemble the peacock in their voice and in some of their\r\nhabits. During the spring the males, as previously described, strut\r\nabout before the comparatively plain-coloured females, expanding and\r\nerecting their tail and wing-feathers, which are ornamented with\r\nnumerous ocelli. I request the reader to turn back to the drawing (fig.\r\n51, p. 90) of a Polyplectron. In _P. Napoleonis_ the ocelli are confined\r\nto the tail, and the back is of a rich metallic blue, in which respects\r\nthis species approaches the Java peacock. _P. Hardwickii_ possesses a\r\npeculiar top-knot, somewhat like that of this same kind of peacock. The\r\nocelli on the wings and tail of the several species of Polyplectron are\r\neither circular or oval, and consist of a beautiful, iridescent,\r\ngreenish-blue or greenish-purple disc, with a black border. This border\r\nin _P. chinquis_ shades into brown which is edged with cream-colour, so\r\nthat the ocellus is here surrounded with differently, though not\r\nbrightly, shaded concentric zones. The unusual length of the\r\ntail-coverts is another highly remarkable character in Polyplectron; for\r\nin some of the species they are half as long, and in others two-thirds\r\nof the length of the true tail-feathers. The tail-coverts are ocellated,\r\nas in the peacock. Thus the several species of Polyplectron manifestly\r\nmake a graduated approach in the length of their tail-coverts, in the\r\nzoning of the ocelli, and in some other characters, to the peacock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. Feather of Peacock, about two-thirds of natural\r\nsize, carefully drawn by Mr. Ford. The transparent zone is represented\r\nby the outermost white zone, confined to the upper end of the disc.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this approach, the first species of Polyplectron which I\r\nhappened to examine almost made me give up the search; for I found not\r\nonly that the true tail-feathers, which in the peacock are quite plain,\r\nwere ornamented with ocelli, but that the ocelli on all the feathers\r\ndiffered fundamentally from those of the peacock, in there being two on\r\nthe same feather, (fig. 54), one on each side of the shaft. Hence I\r\nconcluded that the early progenitors of the peacock could not have\r\nresembled in any degree a Polyplectron. But on continuing my search, I\r\nobserved that in some of the species the two ocelli stood very near each\r\nother; that in the tail-feathers of _P. Hardwickii_ they touched each\r\nother; and, finally, that in the tail-coverts of this same species as\r\nwell as of _P. malaccense_ (fig. 55) they were actually confluent. As\r\nthe central part alone is confluent, an indentation is left at both the\r\nupper and lower ends; and the surrounding coloured zones are likewise\r\nindented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54. Part of a tail-covert of Polyplectron chinquis,\r\nwith two oval ocelli of nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. Part of a tail-covert of Polyplectron\r\nmalaccense, with the two oval ocelli, partially confluent, of nat.\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nA single ocellus is thus formed on each tail-covert, though still\r\nplainly betraying its double origin. These confluent ocelli differ from\r\nthe single ocelli of the peacock in having an indentation at both ends,\r\ninstead of at the lower or basal end alone. The explanation, however, of\r\nthis difference is not difficult; in some species of Polyplectron the\r\ntwo oval ocelli on the same feather stand parallel to each other; in\r\nother species (as in _P. chinquis_) they converge towards one end; now\r\nthe partial confluence of two convergent ocelli would manifestly leave a\r\nmuch deeper indentation at the divergent than at the convergent end. It\r\nis also manifest that if the convergence were strongly pronounced and\r\nthe confluence complete, the indentation at the convergent end would\r\ntend to be quite obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe tail-feathers in both species of peacock are entirely destitute of\r\nocelli, and this apparently is related to their being covered up and\r\nconcealed by the long tail-coverts. In this respect they differ\r\nremarkably from the tail-feathers of Polyplectron, which in most of the\r\nspecies are ornamented with larger ocelli than those on the\r\ntail-coverts. Hence I was led carefully to examine the tail-feathers of\r\nthe several species of Polyplectron in order to discover whether the\r\nocelli in any of them shewed any tendency to disappear, and, to my great\r\nsatisfaction, I was successful. The central tail-feathers of _P.\r\nNapoleonis_ have the two ocelli on each side of the shaft perfectly\r\ndeveloped; but the inner ocellus becomes less and less conspicuous on\r\nthe more exterior tail-feathers, until a mere shadow or rudimentary\r\nvestige is left on the inner side of the outermost feather. Again, in\r\n_P. malaccense_, the ocelli on the tail-coverts are, as we have seen,\r\nconfluent; and these feathers are of unusual length, being two-thirds of\r\nthe length of the tail-feathers, so that in both these respects they\r\nresemble the tail-coverts of the peacock. Now in this species the two\r\ncentral tail-feathers alone are ornamented, each with two\r\nbrightly-coloured ocelli, the ocelli having completely disappeared from\r\nthe inner sides of all the other tail-feathers. Consequently the\r\ntail-coverts and tail-feathers of this species of Polyplectron make a\r\nnear approach in structure and ornamentation to the corresponding\r\nfeathers of the peacock.\r\n\r\nAs far, then, as the principle of gradation throws light on the steps by\r\nwhich the magnificent train of the peacock has been acquired, hardly\r\nanything more is needed. We may picture to ourselves a progenitor of\r\nthe peacock in an almost exactly intermediate condition between the\r\nexisting peacock, with his enormously elongated tail-coverts, ornamented\r\nwith single ocelli, and an ordinary gallinaceous bird with short\r\ntail-coverts, merely spotted with some colour; and we shall then see in\r\nour mind’s eye, a bird possessing tail-coverts, capable of erection and\r\nexpansion, ornamented with two partially confluent ocelli, and long\r\nenough almost to conceal the tail-feathers,—the latter having already\r\npartially lost their ocelli; we shall see in short, a Polyplectron. The\r\nindentation of the central disc and surrounding zones of the ocellus in\r\nboth species of peacock, seems to me to speak plainly in favour of this\r\nview; and this structure is otherwise inexplicable. The males of\r\nPolyplectron are no doubt very beautiful birds, but their beauty, when\r\nviewed from a little distance, cannot be compared, as I formerly saw in\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, with that of the peacock. Many female\r\nprogenitors of the peacock must, during a long line of descent, have\r\nappreciated this superiority; for they have unconsciously, by the\r\ncontinued preference of the most beautiful males, rendered the peacock\r\nthe most splendid of living birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Argus pheasant._—Another excellent case for investigation is offered\r\nby the ocelli on the wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant, which are\r\nshaded in so wonderful a manner as to resemble balls lying within\r\nsockets, and which consequently differ from ordinary ocelli. No one, I\r\npresume, will attribute the shading, which has excited the admiration of\r\nmany experienced artists, to chance—to the fortuitous concourse of\r\natoms of colouring matter. That these ornaments should have been formed\r\nthrough the selection of many successive variations, not one of which\r\nwas originally intended to produce the ball-and-socket effect, seems as\r\nincredible, as that one of Raphael’s Madonnas should have been formed by\r\nthe selection of chance daubs of paint made by a long succession of\r\nyoung artists, not one of whom intended at first to draw the human\r\nfigure. In order to discover how the ocelli have been developed, we\r\ncannot look to a long line of progenitors, nor to various closely-allied\r\nforms, for such do not now exist. But fortunately the several feathers\r\non the wing suffice to give us a clue to the problem, and they prove to\r\ndemonstration that a gradation is at least possible from a mere spot to\r\na finished ball-and-socket ocellus.\r\n\r\nThe wing-feathers, bearing the ocelli, are covered with dark stripes or\r\nrows of dark spots, each stripe or row running obliquely down the outer\r\nside of the shaft to an ocellus. The spots are generally elongated in a\r\ntransverse line to the row in which they stand. They often become\r\nconfluent, either in the line of the row—and then they form a\r\nlongitudinal stripe—or transversely, that is, with the spots in the\r\nadjoining rows, and then they form transverse stripes. A spot sometimes\r\nbreaks up into smaller spots, which still stand in their proper places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. Part of Secondary wing-feather of Argus\r\npheasant, shewing two, _a_ and _b_, perfect ocelli. A, B, C, &c., dark\r\nstripes running obliquely down, each to an ocellus.\r\n\r\n(Much of the web on both sides, especially to the left of the shaft, has\r\nbeen cut off.)]\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient first to describe a perfect ball-and-socket\r\nocellus. This consists of an intensely black circular ring, surrounding\r\na space shaded so as exactly to resemble a ball. The figure here given\r\nhas been admirably drawn by Mr. Ford, and engraved, but a woodcut cannot\r\nexhibit the exquisite shading of the original. The ring is almost always\r\nslightly broken or interrupted (see fig. 56) at a point in the upper\r\nhalf, a little to the right of and above the white shade on the enclosed\r\nball; it is also sometimes broken towards the base on the right hand.\r\nThese little breaks have an important meaning. The ring is always much\r\nthickened, with the edges ill-defined towards the left-hand upper\r\ncorner the feather being held erect, in the position in which it is\r\nhere drawn. Beneath this thickened part there is on the surface of the\r\nball an oblique almost pure-white mark, which shades off downwards into\r\na pale-leaden hue, and this into yellowish and brown tints, which\r\ninsensibly become darker and darker towards the lower part of the ball.\r\nIt is this shading which gives so admirably the effect of light shining\r\non a convex surface. If one of the balls be examined, it will be seen\r\nthat the lower part is of a browner tint and is indistinctly separated\r\nby a curved oblique line from the upper part, which is yellower and more\r\nleaden; this oblique line runs at right angles to the longer axis of the\r\nwhite patch of light, and indeed of all the shading; but this difference\r\nin the tints, which cannot of course be shewn in the woodcut, does not\r\nin the least interfere with the perfect shading of the ball.[195] It\r\nshould be particularly observed that each ocellus stands in obvious\r\nconnection with a dark stripe, or row of dark spots, for both occur\r\nindifferently on the same feather. Thus in fig. 56 stripe A runs to\r\nocellus _a_; B runs to ocellus _b_; stripe C is broken in the upper\r\npart, and runs down to the next succeeding ocellus, not represented in\r\nthe woodcut; D to the next lower one, and so with the stripes E and F.\r\nLastly, the several ocelli are separated from each other by a pale\r\nsurface bearing irregular black marks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. Basal part of the Secondary wing-feather,\r\nnearest to the body.]\r\n\r\nI will next describe the other extreme of the series, namely the first\r\ntrace of an ocellus. The short secondary wing-feather (fig. 57), nearest\r\nto the body, is marked like the other feathers, with oblique,\r\nlongitudinal, rather irregular, rows of spots. The lowest spot, or that\r\nnearest the shaft, in the five lower rows (excluding the basal row) is a\r\nlittle larger than the other spots in the same row, and a little more\r\nelongated in a transverse direction. It differs also from the other\r\nspots by being bordered on its upper side with some dull fulvous\r\nshading. But this spot is not in any way more remarkable than those on\r\nthe plumage of many birds, and might easily be quite overlooked. The\r\nnext higher spot in each row does not differ at all from the upper ones\r\nin the same row, although in the following series it becomes, as we\r\nshall see, greatly modified. The larger spots occupy exactly the same\r\nrelative position on this feather as those occupied by the perfect\r\nocelli on the longer wing-feathers.\r\n\r\nBy looking to the next two or three succeeding secondary wing-feathers,\r\nan absolutely insensible gradation can be traced from one of the\r\nabove-described lower spots, together with the next higher one in the\r\nsame row, to a curious ornament, which cannot be called an ocellus, and\r\nwhich I will name, from the want of a better term, an “elliptic\r\nornament.” These are shewn in the accompanying figure (fig. 58). We here\r\nsee several oblique rows, A, B, C, D (see the lettered diagram), &c., of\r\ndark spots of the usual character. Each row of spots runs down to and is\r\nconnected with one of the elliptic ornaments, in exactly the same manner\r\nas each stripe in fig. 56 runs down to, and is connected with, one of\r\nthe ball-and-socket ocelli. Looking to any one row, for instance, B, the\r\nlowest spot or mark (_b_) is thicker and considerably longer than the\r\nupper spots, and has its left extremity pointed and curved upwards. This\r\nblack mark is abruptly bordered on its upper side by a rather broad\r\nspace of richly-shaded tints, beginning with a narrow brown zone, which\r\npasses into orange, and this into a pale leaden tint, with the end\r\ntowards the shaft much paler. This mark corresponds in every respect\r\nwith the larger, shaded spot, described in the last paragraph (fig. 57),\r\nbut is more highly developed and more brightly coloured. To the right\r\nand above this spot (_b_), with its bright shading, there is a long,\r\nnarrow, black mark (_c_), belonging to the same row, and which is arched\r\na little downwards so as to face (_b_). It is also narrowly edged on the\r\nlower side with a fulvous tint. To the left of and above _c_, in the\r\nsame oblique direction, but always more or less distinct from it, there\r\nis another black mark (_d_). This mark is generally sub-triangular and\r\nirregular in shape, but in the one lettered in the diagram is unusually\r\nnarrow, elongated, and regular. It apparently consists of a lateral and\r\nbroken prolongation of the mark (_c_), as I infer from traces of\r\nsimilar prolongations from the succeeding upper spots; but I do not feel\r\nsure of this. These three marks, _b_, _c_, and _d_, with the intervening\r\nbright shades, form together the so-called elliptic ornament. These\r\nornaments stand in a line parallel to the shaft, and manifestly\r\ncorrespond in position with the ball-and-socket ocelli. Their extremely\r\nelegant appearance cannot be appreciated in the drawing, as the orange\r\nand leaden tints, contrasting so well with the black marks, cannot be\r\nshewn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. Portion of one of the Secondary wing-feathers\r\nnear to the body; shewing the so-called elliptic ornaments.

Apparently a broken prolongation of the spot _c_ in the same\r\n         row B.]\r\n\r\nBetween one of the elliptic ornaments and a perfect ball-and-socket\r\nocellus, the gradation is so perfect that it is scarcely possible to\r\ndecide when the latter term ought to be used. I regret that I have not\r\ngiven an additional drawing, besides fig. 58, which stands about\r\nhalf-way in the series between one of the simple spots and a perfect\r\nocellus. The passage from the elliptic ornament into an ocellus is\r\neffected by the elongation and greater curvature in opposed directions\r\nof the lower black mark (_b_), and more especially of the upper one\r\n(_c_), together with the contraction of the irregular sub-triangular or\r\nnarrow mark (_d_), so that at last these three marks become confluent,\r\nforming an irregular elliptic ring. This ring is gradually rendered more\r\nand more circular and regular, at the same time increasing in diameter.\r\nTraces of the junction of all three elongated spots or marks, especially\r\nof the two upper ones, can still be observed in many of the most perfect\r\nocelli. The broken state of the black ring on the upper side of the\r\nocellus in fig. 56 was pointed out. The irregular sub-triangular or\r\nnarrow mark (_d_) manifestly forms, by its contraction and equalisation,\r\nthe thickened portion of the ring on the left upper side of the perfect\r\nball-and-socket ocellus. The lower part of the ring is invariably a\r\nlittle thicker than the other parts (see fig. 56), and this follows\r\nfrom the lower black mark of the elliptic ornament (_b_) having been\r\noriginally thicker than the upper mark (_c_). Every step can be followed\r\nin the process of confluence and modification; and the black ring which\r\nsurrounds the ball of the ocellus is unquestionably formed by the union\r\nand modification of the three black marks, _b_, _c_, _d_, of the\r\nelliptic ornament. The irregular zigzag black marks between the\r\nsuccessive ocelli (see again fig. 56) are plainly due to the breaking up\r\nof the somewhat more regular but similar marks between the elliptic\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nThe successive steps in the shading of the ball-and-socket ocelli can be\r\nfollowed out with equal clearness. The brown, orange, and pale-leaden\r\nnarrow zones which border the lower black mark of the elliptic ornament\r\ncan be seen gradually to become more and more softened and shaded into\r\neach other, with the upper lighter part towards the left-hand corner\r\nrendered still lighter, so as to become almost white. But even in the\r\nmost perfect ball-and-socket ocelli a slight difference in the tints,\r\nthough not in the shading, between the upper and lower parts of the ball\r\ncan be perceived (as was before especially noticed), the line of\r\nseparation being oblique, in the same direction with the bright coloured\r\nshades of the elliptic ornaments. Thus almost every minute detail in the\r\nshape and colouring of the ball-and-socket ocelli can be shewn to follow\r\nfrom gradual changes in the elliptic ornaments; and the development of\r\nthe latter can be traced by equally small steps from the union of two\r\nalmost simple spots, the lower one (fig. 57) having some dull fulvous\r\nshading on the upper side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. Portion near summit of one of the Secondary\r\nwing-feathers, bearing perfect ball-and-socket ocelli.\r\n\r\n   _a._ Ornamented upper part.\r\n\r\n   _b._ Uppermost, imperfect ball-and-socket ocellus. (The\r\n   shading above the white mark on the summit of the ocellus is\r\n   here a little too dark.)\r\n\r\n   _c._ Perfect ocellus.]\r\n\r\nThe extremities of the longer secondary feathers which bear the perfect\r\nball-and-socket ocelli are peculiarly ornamented. (Fig. 59.) The oblique\r\nlongitudinal stripes suddenly cease upwards and become confused, and\r\nabove this limit the whole upper end of the feather (_a_) is covered\r\nwith white dots, surrounded by little black rings, standing on a dark\r\nground. Even the oblique stripe belonging to the uppermost ocellus (_b_)\r\nis represented only by a very short irregular black mark with the usual,\r\ncurved, transverse base. As this stripe is thus abruptly cut off above,\r\nwe can understand, from what has gone before, how it is that the upper\r\nthickened part of the ring is absent in the uppermost ocellus; for, as\r\nbefore stated, this thickened part is apparently formed by a broken\r\nprolongation of the next higher spot in the same row. From the absence\r\nof the upper and thickened part of the ring, the uppermost ocellus,\r\nthough perfect in all other respects, appears as if its top had been\r\nobliquely sliced off. It would, I think, perplex any one, who believes\r\nthat the plumage of the Argus pheasant was created as we now see it, to\r\naccount for the imperfect condition of the uppermost ocelli. I should\r\nadd that in the secondary wing-feather farthest from the body all the\r\nocelli are smaller and less perfect than on the other feathers, with\r\nthe upper parts of the external black rings deficient, as in the case\r\njust mentioned. The imperfection here seems to be connected with the\r\nfact that the spots on this feather shew less tendency than usual to\r\nbecome confluent into stripes; on the contrary, they are often broken up\r\ninto smaller spots, so that two or three rows run down to each ocellus.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that a perfect series can be followed, from two almost\r\nsimple spots, at first quite distinct from each other, to one of the\r\nwonderful ball-and-socket ornaments. Mr. Gould, who kindly gave me some\r\nof these feathers, fully agrees with me in the completeness of the\r\ngradation. It is obvious that the stages in development exhibited by the\r\nfeathers on the same bird do not at all necessarily shew us the steps\r\nwhich have been passed through by the extinct progenitors of the\r\nspecies; but they probably give us the clue to the actual steps, and\r\nthey at least prove to demonstration that a gradation is possible.\r\nBearing in mind how carefully the male Argus pheasant displays his\r\nplumes before the female, as well as the many facts rendering it\r\nprobable that female birds prefer the more attractive males, no one who\r\nadmits the agency of sexual selection, will deny that a simple dark spot\r\nwith some fulvous shading might be converted, through the approximation\r\nand modification of the adjoining spots, together with some slight\r\nincrease of colour, into one of the so-called elliptic ornaments. These\r\nlatter ornaments have been shewn to many persons, and all have admitted\r\nthat they are extremely pretty, some thinking them even more beautiful\r\nthan the ball-and-socket ocelli. As the secondary plumes became\r\nlengthened through sexual selection, and as the elliptic ornaments\r\nincreased in diameter, their colours apparently became less bright; and\r\nthen the ornamentation of the plumes had to be gained by improvements in\r\nthe pattern and shading; and this process has been carried on until the\r\nwonderful ball-and-socket ocelli have been finally developed. Thus we\r\ncan understand—and in no other way as it seems to me—the present\r\ncondition and origin of the ornaments on the wing-feathers of the Argus\r\npheasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the light reflected by the principle of gradation; from what we\r\nknow of the laws of variation; from the changes which have taken place\r\nin many of our domesticated birds; and, lastly, from the character (as\r\nwe shall hereafter more clearly see) of the immature plumage of young\r\nbirds—we can sometimes indicate with a certain amount of confidence,\r\nthe probable steps by which the males have acquired their brilliant\r\nplumage and various ornaments; yet in many cases we are involved in\r\ndarkness. Mr. Gould several years ago pointed out to me a humming-bird,\r\nthe _Urosticte benjamini_, remarkable from the curious differences\r\npresented by the two sexes. The male, besides a splendid gorget, has\r\ngreenish-black tail-feathers, with the four _central_ ones tipped with\r\nwhite; in the female, as with most of the allied species, the three\r\n_outer_ tail-feathers on each side are tipped with white, so that the\r\nmale has the four central, whilst the female has the six exterior\r\nfeathers ornamented with white tips. What makes the case curious is\r\nthat, although the colouring of the tail differs remarkably in both\r\nsexes of many kinds of humming-birds, Mr. Gould does not know a single\r\nspecies, besides the Urosticte, in which the male has the four central\r\nfeathers tipped with white.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll, in commenting on this case,[196] passes over sexual\r\nselection, and asks, “What explanation does the law of natural selection\r\ngive of such specific varieties as these?” He answers “none whatever;”\r\nand I quite agree with him. But can this be so confidently said of\r\nsexual selection? Seeing in how many ways the tail-feathers of\r\nhumming-birds differ, why should not the four central feathers have\r\nvaried in this one species alone, so as to have acquired white tips? The\r\nvariations may have been gradual, or somewhat abrupt as in the case\r\nrecently given of the humming-birds near Bogota, in which certain\r\nindividuals alone have the “central tail-feathers tipped with beautiful\r\ngreen.” In the female of the Urosticte I noticed extremely minute or\r\nrudimental white tips to the two outer of the four central black\r\ntail-feathers; so that here we have an indication of change of some kind\r\nin the plumage of this species. If we grant the possibility of the\r\ncentral tail-feathers of the male varying in whiteness, there is nothing\r\nstrange in such variations having been sexually selected. The white\r\ntips, together with the small white ear-tufts, certainly add, as the\r\nDuke of Argyll admits, to the beauty of the male; and whiteness is\r\napparently appreciated by other birds, as may be inferred from such\r\ncases as the snow-white male of the Bell-bird. The statement made by Sir\r\nE. Heron should not be forgotten, namely that his peahens, when debarred\r\nfrom access to the pied peacock, would not unite with any other male,\r\nand during that season produced no offspring. Nor is it strange that\r\nvariations in the tail-feathers of the Urosticte should have been\r\nspecially selected for the sake of ornament, for the next succeeding\r\ngenus in the family takes its name of Metallura from the splendour of\r\nthese feathers. Mr. Gould, after describing the peculiar plumage of the\r\nUrosticte, adds, “that ornament and variety is the sole object, I have\r\nmyself but little doubt.”[197] If this be admitted, we can perceive that\r\nthe males which were decked in the most elegant and novel manner would\r\nhave gained an advantage, not in the ordinary struggle for life, but in\r\nrivalry with other males, and would consequently have left a larger\r\nnumber of offspring to inherit their newly-acquired beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nBIRDS—_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Discussion why the males alone of some species, and both sexes\r\n   of other species, are brightly coloured—On sexually-limited\r\n   inheritance, as applied to various structures and to\r\n   brightly-coloured plumage—Nidification in relation to\r\n   colour—Loss of nuptial plumage during the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have in this chapter to consider, why with many kinds of birds the\r\nfemale has not received the same ornaments as the male; and why with\r\nmany others, both sexes are equally, or almost equally, ornamented? In\r\nthe following chapter we shall consider why in some few rare cases the\r\nfemale is more conspicuously coloured than the male.\r\n\r\nIn my ‘Origin of Species’[198] I briefly suggested that the long tail of\r\nthe peacock would be inconvenient, and the conspicuous black colour of\r\nthe male capercailzie dangerous, to the female during the period of\r\nincubation; and consequently that the transmission of these characters\r\nfrom the male to the female offspring had been checked through natural\r\nselection. I still think that this may have occurred in some few\r\ninstances: but after mature reflection on all the facts which I have\r\nbeen able to collect, I am now inclined to believe that when the sexes\r\ndiffer, the successive variations have generally been from the first\r\nlimited in their transmission to the same sex in which they first\r\nappeared. Since my remarks appeared, the subject of sexual coloration\r\nhas been discussed in some very interesting papers by Mr. Wallace,[199]\r\nwho believes that in almost all cases the successive variations tended\r\nat first to be transmitted equally to both sexes; but that the female\r\nwas saved, through natural selection, from acquiring the conspicuous\r\ncolours of the male, owing to the danger which she would thus have\r\nincurred during incubation.\r\n\r\nThis view necessitates a tedious discussion on a difficult point, namely\r\nwhether the transmission of a character, which is at first inherited by\r\nboth sexes, can be subsequently limited in its transmission, by means of\r\nselection, to one sex alone. We must bear in mind, as shewn in the\r\npreliminary chapter on sexual selection, that characters which are\r\nlimited in their development to one sex are always latent in the other.\r\nAn imaginary illustration will best aid us in seeing the difficulty of\r\nthe case: we may suppose that a fancier wished to make a breed of\r\npigeons, in which the males alone should be coloured of a pale blue,\r\nwhilst the females retained their former slaty tint. As with pigeons\r\ncharacters of all kinds are usually transmitted to both sexes equally,\r\nthe fancier would have to try to convert this latter form of inheritance\r\ninto sexually-limited transmission. All that he could do would be to\r\npersevere in selecting every male pigeon which was in the least degree\r\nof a paler blue; and the natural result of this process, if steadily\r\ncarried on for a long time, and if the pale variations were strongly\r\ninherited or often recurred, would be to make his whole stock of a\r\nlighter blue. But our fancier would be compelled to match, generation\r\nafter generation, his pale blue males with slaty females, for he wishes\r\nto keep the latter of this colour. The result would generally be the\r\nproduction either of a mongrel piebald lot, or more probably the speedy\r\nand complete loss of the pale-blue colour, for the primordial slaty tint\r\nwould be transmitted with prepotent force. Supposing, however, that some\r\npale-blue males and slaty females were produced during each successive\r\ngeneration, and were always crossed together; then the slaty females\r\nwould have, if I may use the expression, much blue blood in their veins,\r\nfor their fathers, grandfathers, etc., will all have been blue birds.\r\nUnder these circumstances it is conceivable (though I know of no\r\ndistinct facts rendering it probable) that the slaty females might\r\nacquire so strong a latent tendency to pale-blueness, that they would\r\nnot destroy this colour in their male offspring, their female offspring\r\nstill inheriting the slaty tint. If so, the desired end of making a\r\nbreed with the two sexes permanently different in colour might be\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nThe extreme importance, or rather necessity, of the desired character in\r\nthe above case, namely, pale-blueness, being present though in a latent\r\nstate in the female, so that the male offspring should not be\r\ndeteriorated, will be best appreciated as follows: the male of\r\nSœmmerring’s pheasant has a tail thirty-seven inches in length,\r\nwhilst that of the female is only eight inches; the tail of the male\r\ncommon pheasant is about twenty inches, and that of the female twelve\r\ninches long. Now if the female Sœmmerring pheasant with her _short_\r\ntail were crossed with the male common pheasant, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the male hybrid offspring would have a much _longer_ tail than that\r\nof the pure offspring of the common pheasant. On the other hand, if the\r\nfemale common pheasant, with her tail nearly _twice as long_ as that of\r\nthe female Sœmmerring pheasant, were crossed with the male of the\r\nlatter, the male hybrid offspring would have a much _shorter_ tail than\r\nthat of the pure offspring of Sœmmerring’s pheasant.[200]\r\n\r\nOur fancier, in order to make his new breed with the males of a decided\r\npale-blue tint, and the females unchanged, would have to continue\r\nselecting the males during many generations; and each stage of paleness\r\nwould have to be fixed in the males, and rendered latent in the females.\r\nThe task would be an extremely difficult one, and has never been tried,\r\nbut might possibly succeed. The chief obstacle would be the early and\r\ncomplete loss of the pale-blue tint, from the necessity of reiterated\r\ncrosses with the slaty female, the latter not having at first any\r\n_latent_ tendency to produce pale-blue offspring.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if one or two males were to vary ever so slightly in\r\npaleness, and the variations were from the first limited in their\r\ntransmission to the male sex, the task of making a new breed of the\r\ndesired kind would be easy, for such males would simply have to be\r\nselected and matched with ordinary females. An analogous case has\r\nactually occurred, for there are breeds of the pigeon in Belgium[201] in\r\nwhich the males alone are marked with black striæ. In the case of the\r\nfowl, variations of colour limited in their transmission to the male sex\r\nhabitually occur. Even when this form of inheritance prevails, it might\r\nwell happen that some of the successive steps in the process of\r\nvariation might be transferred to the female, who would then come to\r\nresemble in a slight degree the male, as occurs in some breeds of the\r\nfowl. Or again, the greater number, but not all, of the successive\r\nsteps might be transferred to both sexes, and the female would then\r\nclosely resemble the male. There can hardly be a doubt that this is the\r\ncause of the male pouter pigeon having a somewhat larger crop, and of\r\nthe male carrier pigeon having somewhat larger wattles, than their\r\nrespective females; for fanciers have not selected one sex more than the\r\nother, and have had no wish that these characters should be more\r\nstrongly displayed in the male than in the female, yet this is the case\r\nwith both breeds.\r\n\r\nThe same process would have to be followed, and the same difficulties\r\nwould be encountered, if it were desired to make a breed with the\r\nfemales alone of some new colour.\r\n\r\nLastly, our fancier might wish to make a breed with the two sexes\r\ndiffering from each other, and both from the parent-species. Here the\r\ndifficulty would be extreme, unless the successive variations were from\r\nthe first sexually limited on both sides, and then there would be no\r\ndifficulty. We see this with the fowl; thus the two sexes of the\r\npencilled Hamburghs differ greatly from each other, and from the two\r\nsexes of the aboriginal _Gallus bankiva_; and both are now kept constant\r\nto their standard of excellence by continued selection, which would be\r\nimpossible unless the distinctive characters of both were limited in\r\ntheir transmission. The Spanish fowl offers a more curious case; the\r\nmale has an immense comb, but some of the successive variations, by the\r\naccumulation of which it was acquired, appear to have been transferred\r\nto the female; for she has a comb many times larger than that of the\r\nfemales of the parent-species. But the comb of the female differs in one\r\nrespect from that of the male, for it is apt to lop over; and within a\r\nrecent period it has been ordered by the fancy that this should always\r\nbe the case, and success has quickly followed the order. Now the\r\nlopping of the comb must be sexually limited in its transmission,\r\notherwise it would prevent the comb of the male from being perfectly\r\nupright, which would be abhorrent to every fancier. On the other hand\r\nthe uprightness of the comb in the male must likewise be a\r\nsexually-limited character, otherwise it would prevent the comb of the\r\nfemale from lopping over.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing illustrations, we see that even with almost unlimited\r\ntime at command, it would be an extremely difficult and complex process,\r\nthough perhaps not impossible, to change through selection one form of\r\ntransmission into the other. Therefore, without distinct evidence in\r\neach case, I am unwilling to admit that this has often been effected\r\nwith natural species. On the other hand by means of successive\r\nvariations, which were from the first sexually limited in their\r\ntransmission, there would not be the least difficulty in rendering a\r\nmale bird widely different in colour or in any other character from the\r\nfemale; the latter being left unaltered, or slightly altered, or\r\nspecially modified for the sake of protection.\r\n\r\nAs bright colours are of service to the males in their rivalry with\r\nother males, such colours would be selected, whether or not they were\r\ntransmitted exclusively to the same sex. Consequently the females might\r\nbe expected often to partake of the brightness of the males to a greater\r\nor less degree; and this occurs with a host of species. If all the\r\nsuccessive variations were transmitted equally to both sexes, the\r\nfemales would be undistinguishable from the males; and this likewise\r\noccurs with many birds. If, however, dull colours were of high\r\nimportance for the safety of the female during incubation, as with many\r\nground birds, the females which varied in brightness, or which received\r\nthrough inheritance from the males any marked accession of brightness,\r\nwould sooner or later be destroyed. But the tendency in the males to\r\ncontinue for an indefinite period transmitting to their female offspring\r\ntheir own brightness, would have to be eliminated by a change in the\r\nform of inheritance; and this, as shewn by our previous illustration,\r\nwould be extremely difficult. The more probable result of the\r\nlong-continued destruction of the more brightly-coloured females,\r\nsupposing the equal form of transmission to prevail, would be the\r\nlessening or annihilation of the bright colours of the males, owing to\r\ntheir continually crossing with the duller females. It would be tedious\r\nto follow out all the other possible results; but I may remind the\r\nreader, as shewn in the eighth chapter, that if sexually-limited\r\nvariations in brightness occurred in the females, even if they were not\r\nin the least injurious to them and consequently were not eliminated, yet\r\nthey would not be favoured or selected, for the male usually accepts any\r\nfemale, and does not select the more attractive individuals;\r\nconsequently these variations would be liable to be lost, and would have\r\nlittle influence on the character of the race; and this will aid in\r\naccounting for the females being commonly less brightly-coloured than\r\nthe males.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter just referred to, instances were given, and any number\r\nmight have been added, of variations occurring at different ages, and\r\ninherited at the same age. It was also shewn that variations which occur\r\nlate in life are commonly transmitted to the same sex in which they\r\nfirst appeared; whilst variations occurring early in life are apt to be\r\ntransmitted to both sexes; not that all the cases of sexually-limited\r\ntransmission can thus be accounted for. It was further shewn that if a\r\nmale bird varied by becoming brighter whilst young, such variations\r\nwould be of no service until the age for reproduction had arrived, and\r\nthere was competition between rival males. If we suppose that\r\nthree-fourths of the young males of any species are on an average\r\ndestroyed by various enemies; then the chances would be as three to one\r\nagainst any one individual more brightly-coloured than usual surviving\r\nto propagate its kind. But in the case of birds which live on the ground\r\nand which commonly need the protection of dull colours, bright tints\r\nwould be far more dangerous to the young and inexperienced than to the\r\nadult males. Consequently the males which varied in brightness whilst\r\nyoung would suffer much destruction and be eliminated through natural\r\nselection; on the other hand the males which varied in this manner when\r\nnearly mature, notwithstanding that they were exposed to some additional\r\ndanger, might survive, and from being favoured through sexual selection,\r\nwould procreate their kind. The brightly-coloured young males being\r\ndestroyed and the mature ones being successful in their courtship, may\r\naccount, on the principle of a relation existing between the period of\r\nvariation and the form of transmission, for the males alone of many\r\nbirds, having acquired and transmitted brilliant colours to their male\r\noffspring alone. But I by no means wish to maintain that the influence\r\nof age on the form of transmission is indirectly the sole cause of the\r\ngreat difference in brilliancy between the sexes of many birds.\r\n\r\nAs with all birds in which the sexes differ in colour, it is an\r\ninteresting question whether the males alone have been modified through\r\nsexual selection, the females being left, as far as this agency is\r\nconcerned, unchanged or only partially changed; or whether the females\r\nhave been specially modified through natural selection for the sake of\r\nprotection, I will discuss this question at considerable length, even\r\nat greater length than its intrinsic importance deserves; for various\r\ncurious collateral points may thus be conveniently considered.\r\n\r\nBefore we enter on the subject of colour, more especially in reference\r\nto Mr. Wallace’s conclusions, it may be useful to discuss under a\r\nsimilar point of view some other differences between the sexes. A breed\r\nof fowls formerly existed in Germany[202] in which the hens were\r\nfurnished with spurs; they were good layers, but they so greatly\r\ndisturbed their nests with their spurs that they could not be allowed to\r\nsit on their own eggs. Hence at one time it appeared to me probable that\r\nwith the females of the wild Gallinaceæ the development of spurs had\r\nbeen checked through natural selection, from the injury thus caused to\r\ntheir nests. This seemed all the more probable as the wing-spurs, which\r\ncould not be injurious during nidification, are often as well developed\r\nin the female as in the male; though in not a few cases they are rather\r\nlarger in the male. When the male is furnished with leg-spurs the female\r\nalmost always exhibits rudiments of them,—the rudiment sometimes\r\nconsisting of a mere scale, as with the species of Gallus. Hence it\r\nmight be argued that the females had aboriginally been furnished with\r\nwell-developed spurs, but that these had subsequently been lost either\r\nthrough disuse or natural selection. But if this view be admitted, it\r\nwould have to be extended to innumerable other cases; and it implies\r\nthat the female progenitors of the existing spur-bearing species were\r\nonce encumbered with an injurious appendage.\r\n\r\nIn some few genera and species, as in Galloperdix, Acomus, and the Javan\r\npeacock (_Pavo muticus_), the females, as well as the males, possess\r\nwell-developed spurs. Are we to infer from this fact that they construct\r\na different sort of nest, not liable to be injured by their spurs, from\r\nthat made by their nearest allies, so that there has been no need for\r\nthe removal of their spurs? Or are we to suppose that these females\r\nespecially require spurs for their defence? It is a more probable\r\nconclusion that both the presence and absence of spurs in the females\r\nresult from different laws of inheritance having prevailed,\r\nindependently of natural selection. With the many females in which spurs\r\nappear as rudiments, we may conclude that some few of the successive\r\nvariations, through which they were developed in the males, occurred\r\nvery early in life, and were as a consequence transferred to the\r\nfemales. In the other and much rarer cases, in which the females possess\r\nfully developed spurs, we may conclude that all the successive\r\nvariations were transferred to them; and that they gradually acquired\r\nthe inherited habit of not disturbing their nests.\r\n\r\nThe vocal organs and the variously-modified feathers for producing\r\nsound, as well as the proper instincts for using them, often differ in\r\nthe two sexes, but are sometimes the same in both. Can such differences\r\nbe accounted for by the males having acquired these organs and\r\ninstincts, whilst the females have been saved from inheriting them, on\r\naccount of the danger to which they would have been exposed by\r\nattracting the attention of birds or beasts of prey? This does not seem\r\nto me probable, when we think of the multitude of birds which with\r\nimpunity gladden the country with their voices during the spring.[203]\r\nIt is a safer conclusion that as vocal and instrumental organs are of\r\nspecial service only to the males during their courtship, these organs\r\nwere developed through sexual selection and continued use in this sex\r\nalone—the successive variations and the effects of use having been from\r\nthe first limited in their transmission in a greater or less degree to\r\nthe male offspring.\r\n\r\nMany analogous cases could be advanced; for instance the plumes on the\r\nhead, which are generally longer in the male than in the female,\r\nsometimes of equal length in both sexes, and occasionally absent in the\r\nfemale,—these several cases sometimes occurring in the same group of\r\nbirds. It would be difficult to account for a difference of this kind\r\nbetween the sexes on the principle of the female having been benefited\r\nby possessing a slightly shorter crest than the male, and its consequent\r\ndiminution or complete suppression through natural selection. But I will\r\ntake a more favourable case, namely, the length of the tail. The long\r\ntrain of the peacock would have been not only inconvenient but dangerous\r\nto the peahen during the period of incubation and whilst accompanying\r\nher young. Hence there is not the least _à priori_ improbability in the\r\ndevelopment of her tail having been checked through natural selection.\r\nBut the females of various pheasants, which apparently are exposed on\r\ntheir open nests to as much danger as the peahen, have tails of\r\nconsiderable length. The females as well as the males of the _Menura\r\nsuperba_ have long tails, and they build a domed nest, which is a great\r\nanomaly in so large a bird. Naturalists have wondered how the female\r\nMenura could manage her tail during incubation; but it is now\r\nknown[204] that she “enters the nest head first, and then turns round\r\nwith her tail sometimes over her back, but more often bent round by her\r\nside. Thus in time the tail becomes quite askew, and is a tolerable\r\nguide to the length of time the bird has been sitting.” Both sexes of an\r\nAustralian kingfisher (_Tanysiptera sylvia_) have the middle\r\ntail-feathers greatly lengthened; and as the female makes her nest in a\r\nhole, these feathers become, as I am informed by Mr. R. B. Sharpe, much\r\ncrumpled during nidification.\r\n\r\nIn these two cases the great length of the tail-feathers must be in some\r\ndegree inconvenient to the female; and as in both species the\r\ntail-feathers of the female are somewhat shorter than those of the male,\r\nit might be argued that their full development had been prevented\r\nthrough natural selection. Judging from these cases, if with the peahen,\r\nthe development of the tail had been checked only when it became\r\ninconveniently or dangerously long, she would have acquired a much\r\nlonger tail than she actually possesses; for her tail is not nearly so\r\nlong, relatively to the size of her body, as that of many female\r\npheasants, nor longer than that of the female turkey. It must also be\r\nborne in mind, that in accordance with this view as soon as the tail of\r\nthe peahen became dangerously long, and its development was consequently\r\nchecked, she would have continually reacted on her male progeny, and\r\nthus have prevented the peacock from acquiring his present magnificent\r\ntrain. We may therefore infer that the length of the tail in the peacock\r\nand its shortness in the peahen are the result of the requisite\r\nvariations in the male having been from the first transmitted to the\r\nmale offspring alone.\r\n\r\nWe are led to a nearly similar conclusion with respect to the length of\r\nthe tail in the various species of pheasants. In the Eared pheasant\r\n(_Crossoptilon auritum_) the tail is of equal length in both sexes,\r\nnamely, sixteen or seventeen inches; in the common pheasant it is about\r\ntwenty inches long in the male, and twelve in the female; in\r\nSœmmerring’s pheasant, thirty-seven inches in the male, and only\r\neight in the female; and lastly in Reeve’s pheasant it is sometimes\r\nactually seventy-two inches long in the male and sixteen in the female.\r\nThus in the several species, the tail of the female differs much in\r\nlength, irrespectively of that of the male; and this can be accounted\r\nfor as it seems to me, with much more probability, by the laws of\r\ninheritance,—that is by the successive variations having been from the\r\nfirst more or less closely limited in their transmission to the male\r\nsex,—than by the agency of natural selection, owing to the length of\r\ntail having been injurious in a greater or less degree to the females of\r\nthe several species.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may now consider Mr. Wallace’s arguments, in regard to the sexual\r\ncoloration of birds. He believes that the bright tints originally\r\nacquired through sexual selection by the males, would in all or almost\r\nall cases have been transmitted to the females, unless the transference\r\nhad been checked through natural selection. I may here remind the reader\r\nthat various facts bearing on this view have already been given under\r\nreptiles, amphibians, fishes, and lepidoptera. Mr. Wallace rests his\r\nbelief chiefly, but not exclusively, as we shall see in the next\r\nchapter, on the following statement,[205] that when both sexes are\r\ncoloured in a strikingly-conspicuous manner the nest is of such a\r\nnature as to conceal the sitting bird; but when there is a marked\r\ncontrast of colour between the sexes, the male being gay and the female\r\ndull-coloured, the nest is open and exposes the sitting bird to view.\r\nThis coincidence, as far as it goes, certainly supports the belief that\r\nthe females which sit on open nests have been specially modified for the\r\nsake of protection. Mr. Wallace admits that there are, as might have\r\nbeen expected, some exceptions to his two rules, but it is a question\r\nwhether the exceptions are not so numerous as seriously to invalidate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere is in the first place much truth in the Duke of Argyll’s\r\nremark[206] that a large domed nest is more conspicuous to an enemy,\r\nespecially to all tree-haunting carnivorous animals, than a smaller open\r\nnest. Nor must we forget that with many birds which build open nests the\r\nmales sit on the eggs and aid in feeding the young as well as the\r\nfemales: this is the case, for instance, with _Pyranga æstiva_,[207] one\r\nof the most splendid birds in the United States, the male being\r\nvermilion, and the female light brownish-green. Now if brilliant colours\r\nhad been extremely dangerous to birds whilst sitting on their open\r\nnests, the males in these cases would have suffered greatly. It might,\r\nhowever, be of such paramount importance to the male to be brilliantly\r\ncoloured, in order to beat his rivals, that this would more than\r\ncompensate for some additional danger.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace admits that with the King-crows (Dicrurus), Orioles, and\r\nPittidæ, the females are conspicuously coloured, yet they build open\r\nnests; but he urges that the birds of the first group are highly\r\npugnacious and could defend themselves; that those of the second group\r\ntake extreme care in concealing their open nests, but this does not\r\ninvariably hold good;[208] and that with the birds of the third group\r\nthe females are brightly coloured chiefly on the under surface. Besides\r\nthese cases the whole great family of pigeons, which are sometimes\r\nbrightly, and almost always conspicuously coloured, and which are\r\nnotoriously liable to the attacks of birds of prey, offers a serious\r\nexception to the rule, for pigeons almost always build open and exposed\r\nnests. In another large family, that of the Humming-birds, all the\r\nspecies build open nests, yet with some of the most gorgeous species the\r\nsexes are alike; and in the majority, the females, though less brilliant\r\nthan the males, are very brightly coloured. Nor can it be maintained\r\nthat all female humming-birds, which are brightly coloured, escape\r\ndetection by their tints being green, for some display on their upper\r\nsurfaces red, blue, and other colours.[209]\r\n\r\nIn regard to birds which build in holes or construct domed nests, other\r\nadvantages, as Mr. Wallace remarks, besides concealment are gained, such\r\nas shelter from the rain, greater warmth, and in hot countries\r\nprotection from the rays of the sun;[210] so that it is no valid\r\nobjection to his view that many birds having both sexes obscurely\r\ncoloured build concealed nests.[211] The female Hornbills (_Buceros_),\r\nfor instance, of India and Africa are protected, during nidification,\r\nwith extraordinary care, for the male plaisters up the hole in which the\r\nfemale sits on her eggs, and leaves only a small orifice through which\r\nhe feeds her; she is thus kept a close prisoner during the whole period\r\nof incubation;[212] yet female hornbills are not more conspicuously\r\ncoloured than many other birds of equal size which build open nests. It\r\nis a more serious objection to Mr. Wallace’s view, as is admitted by\r\nhim, that in some few groups the males are brilliantly coloured and the\r\nfemales obscure, and yet the latter hatch their eggs in domed nests.\r\nThis is the case with the Grallinæ of Australia, the Superb Warblers\r\n(Maluridæ) of the same country, the Sun-birds (Nectariniæ), and with\r\nseveral of the Australian Honey-suckers or Meliphagidæ.[213]\r\n\r\nIf we look to the birds of England we shall see that there is no close\r\nand general relation between the colours of the female and the nature of\r\nthe nest constructed by her. About forty of our British birds (excluding\r\nthose of large size which could defend themselves) build in holes in\r\nbanks, rocks, or trees, or construct domed nests. If we take the colours\r\nof the female goldfinch, bullfinch, or blackbird, as a standard of the\r\ndegree of conspicuousness, which is not highly dangerous to the sitting\r\nfemale, then out of the above forty birds, the females of only twelve\r\ncan be considered as conspicuous to a dangerous degree, the remaining\r\ntwenty-eight being inconspicuous.[214] Nor is there any close relation\r\nbetween a well-pronounced difference in colour between the two sexes,\r\nand the nature of the nest constructed. Thus the male house-sparrow\r\n(_Passer domesticus_) differs much from the female, the male\r\ntree-sparrow (_P. montanus_) differs hardly at all, and yet both build\r\nwell-concealed nests. The two sexes of the common fly-catcher\r\n(_Muscicapa grisola_) can hardly be distinguished, whilst the sexes of\r\nthe pied fly-catcher (_M. luctuosa_) differ considerably, and both build\r\nin holes. The female blackbird (_Turdus merula_) differs much, the\r\nfemale ring-ouzel (_T. torquatus_) differs less, and the female common\r\nthrush (_T. musicus_) hardly at all from their respective males; yet all\r\nbuild open nests. On the other hand, the not very distantly-allied\r\nwater-ouzel (_Cinclus aquaticus_) builds a domed nest, and the sexes\r\ndiffer about as much as in the case of the ring-ouzel. The black and red\r\ngrouse (_Tetrao tetrix_ and _T. Scoticus_) build open nests, in equally\r\nwell-concealed spots, but in the one species the sexes differ greatly,\r\nand in the other very little.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing objections, I cannot doubt, after reading\r\nMr. Wallace’s excellent essay, that looking to the birds of the world,\r\na large majority of the species in which the females are conspicuously\r\ncoloured (and in this case the males with rare exceptions are equally\r\nconspicuous), build concealed nests for the sake of protection. Mr.\r\nWallace enumerates[215] a long series of groups in which this rule holds\r\ngood; but it will suffice here to give, as instances, the more familiar\r\ngroups of kingfishers, toucans, trogons, puff-birds (Capitonidæ),\r\nplaintain-eaters (Musophagæ), woodpeckers, and parrots. Mr. Wallace\r\nbelieves that in these groups, as the males gradually acquired through\r\nsexual selection their brilliant colours, these were transferred to the\r\nfemales and were not eliminated by natural selection, owing to the\r\nprotection which they already enjoyed from their manner of nidification.\r\nAccording to this view, their present manner of nesting was acquired\r\nbefore their present colours. But it seems to me much more probable that\r\nin most cases as the females were gradually rendered more and more\r\nbrilliant from partaking of the colours of the male, they were gradually\r\nled to change their instincts (supposing that they originally built open\r\nnests), and to seek protection by building domed or concealed nests. No\r\none who studies, for instance, Audubon’s account of the differences in\r\nthe nests of the same species in the Northern and Southern United\r\nStates,[216] will feel any great difficulty in admitting that birds,\r\neither by a change (in the strict sense of the word) of their habits, or\r\nthrough the natural selection of so-called spontaneous variations of\r\ninstinct, might readily be led to modify their manner of nesting.\r\n\r\nThis way of viewing the relation, as far as it holds good, between the\r\nbright colours of female birds and their manner of nesting, receives\r\nsome support from certain analogous cases occurring in the Sahara\r\nDesert. Here, as in most other deserts, various birds, and many other\r\nanimals, have had their colours adapted in a wonderful manner to the\r\ntints of the surrounding surface. Nevertheless there are, as I am\r\ninformed by the Rev. Mr. Tristram, some curious exceptions to the rule;\r\nthus the male of the _Monticola cyanea_ is conspicuous from his bright\r\nblue colour, and the female almost equally conspicuous from her mottled\r\nbrown and white plumage; both sexes of two species of Dromolæa are of a\r\nlustrous black; so that these three birds are far from receiving\r\nprotection from their colours, yet they are able to survive, for they\r\nhave acquired the habit, when in danger, of taking refuge in holes or\r\ncrevices in the rocks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the above-specified groups of birds, in which the\r\nfemales are conspicuously coloured and build concealed nests, it is not\r\nnecessary to suppose that each separate species had its nidifying\r\ninstinct specially modified; but only that the early progenitors of each\r\ngroup were gradually led to build domed or concealed nests; and\r\nafterwards transmitted this instinct, together with their bright\r\ncolours, to their modified descendants. This conclusion, as far as it\r\ncan be trusted, is interesting, namely, that sexual selection, together\r\nwith equal or nearly equal inheritance by both sexes, have indirectly\r\ndetermined the manner of nidification of whole groups of birds.\r\n\r\nEven in the groups in which, according to Mr. Wallace, the females from\r\nbeing protected during nidification, have not had their bright colours\r\neliminated through natural selection, the males often differ in a\r\nslight, and occasionally in a considerable degree, from the females.\r\nThis is a significant fact, for such differences in colour must be\r\naccounted for on the principle of some of the variations in the males\r\nhaving been from the first limited in their transmission to the same\r\nsex; as it can hardly be maintained that these differences, especially\r\nwhen very slight, serve as a protection to the female. Thus all the\r\nspecies in the splendid group of the Trogons build in holes; and Mr.\r\nGould gives figures[217] of both sexes of twenty-five species, in all of\r\nwhich, with one partial exception, the sexes differ sometimes slightly,\r\nsometimes conspicuously, in colour,—the males being always more\r\nbeautiful than the females, though the latter are likewise beautiful.\r\nAll the species of kingfisher build in holes, and with most of the\r\nspecies the sexes are equally brilliant, and thus far Mr. Wallace’s rule\r\nholds good; but in some of the Australian species the colours of the\r\nfemales are rather less vivid than those of the male; and in one\r\nsplendidly-coloured species, the sexes differ so much that they were at\r\nfirst thought to be specifically distinct.[218] Mr. R. B. Sharpe, who\r\nhas especially studied this group, has shewn me some American species\r\n(Ceryle) in which the breast of the male is belted with black. Again, in\r\nCarcineutes, the difference between the sexes is conspicuous: in the\r\nmale the upper surface is dull-blue banded with black, the lower surface\r\nbeing partly fawn-coloured, and there is much red about the head; in the\r\nfemale the upper surface is reddish-brown banded with black, and the\r\nlower surface white with black markings. It is an interesting fact, as\r\nshewing how the same peculiar style of sexual colouring often\r\ncharacterises allied forms, that in three species of Dacelo the male\r\ndiffers from the female only in the tail being dull-blue banded with\r\nblack, whilst that of the female is brown with blackish bars; so that\r\nhere the tail differs in colour in the two sexes in exactly the same\r\nmanner as the whole upper surface in the sexes of Carcineutes.\r\n\r\nWith parrots, which likewise build in holes, we find analogous cases: in\r\nmost of the species both sexes are brilliantly coloured and\r\nundistinguishable, but in not a few species the males are coloured\r\nrather more vividly than the females, or even very differently from\r\nthem. Thus, besides other strongly-marked differences, the whole under\r\nsurface of the male King Lory (_Aprosmictus scapulatus_) is scarlet,\r\nwhilst the throat and chest of the female is green tinged with red: in\r\nthe _Euphema splendida_ there is a similar difference, the face and\r\nwing-coverts moreover of the female being of a paler blue than in the\r\nmale.[219] In the family of the tits (_Parinæ_), which build concealed\r\nnests, the female of our common blue tomtit (_Parus cæruleus_) is “much\r\nless brightly coloured” than the male; and in the magnificent Sultan\r\nyellow tit of India the difference is greater.[220]\r\n\r\nAgain in the great group of the woodpeckers,[221] the sexes are\r\ngenerally nearly alike, but in the _Megapicus validus_ all those parts\r\nof the head, neck, and breast, which are crimson in the male are pale\r\nbrown in the female. As in several woodpeckers the head of the male is\r\nbright crimson, whilst that of the female is plain, it occurred to me\r\nthat this colour might possibly make the female dangerously conspicuous,\r\nwhenever she put her head out of the hole containing her nest, and\r\nconsequently that this colour, in accordance with Mr. Wallace’s belief,\r\nhad been eliminated. This view is strengthened by what Malherbe states\r\nwith respect to _Indopicus carlotta_; namely, that the young females,\r\nlike the young males, have some crimson about their heads, but that this\r\ncolour disappears in the adult female, whilst it is intensified in the\r\nadult male. Nevertheless the following considerations render this view\r\nextremely doubtful: the male takes a fair share in incubation,[222] and\r\nwould be thus far almost equally exposed to danger; both sexes of many\r\nspecies have their heads of an equally bright crimson; in other species\r\nthe difference between the sexes in the amount of scarlet is so slight\r\nthat it can hardly make any appreciable difference in the danger\r\nincurred; and lastly, the colouring of the head in the two sexes often\r\ndiffers slightly in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe cases, as yet given, of slight and graduated differences in colour\r\nbetween the males and females in the groups, in which as a general rule\r\nthe sexes resemble each other, all relate to species which build domed\r\nor concealed nests. But similar gradations may likewise be observed in\r\ngroups in which the sexes as a general rule resemble each other, but\r\nwhich build open nests. As I have before instanced the Australian\r\nparrots, so I may here instance, without giving any details, the\r\nAustralian pigeons.[223] It deserves especial notice that in all these\r\ncases the slight differences in plumage between the sexes are of the\r\nsame general nature as the occasionally greater differences. A good\r\nillustration of this fact has already been afforded by those kingfishers\r\nin which either the tail alone or the whole upper surface of the plumage\r\ndiffers in the same manner in the two sexes. Similar cases may be\r\nobserved with parrots and pigeons. The differences in colour between the\r\nsexes of the same species are, also, of the same general nature as the\r\ndifferences in colour between the distinct species of the same group.\r\nFor when in a group in which the sexes are usually alike, the male\r\ndiffers considerably from the female, he is not coloured in a quite new\r\nstyle. Hence we may infer that within the same group the special colours\r\nof both sexes when they are alike, and the colours of the male, when he\r\ndiffers slightly or even considerably from the female, have in most\r\ncases been determined by the same general cause; this being sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable, as has already been remarked, that differences in\r\ncolour between the sexes, when very slight, can be of service to the\r\nfemale as a protection. Assuming, however, that they are of service,\r\nthey might be thought to be cases of transition; but we have no reason\r\nto believe that many species at any one time are undergoing change.\r\nTherefore we can hardly admit that the numerous females which differ\r\nvery slightly in colour from their males are now all commencing to\r\nbecome obscure for the sake of protection. Even if we consider somewhat\r\nmore marked sexual differences, is it probable, for instance, that the\r\nhead of the female chaffinch, the crimson on the breast of the female\r\nbullfinch,—the green of the female greenfinch,—the crest of the female\r\ngolden-crested wren, have all been rendered less bright by the slow\r\nprocess of selection for the sake of protection? I cannot think so; and\r\nstill less with the slight differences between the sexes of those birds\r\nwhich build concealed nests. On the other hand, the differences in\r\ncolour between the sexes, whether great or small, may to a large extent\r\nbe explained on the principle of the successive variations, acquired by\r\nthe males through sexual selection, having been from the first more or\r\nless limited in their transmission to the females. That the degree of\r\nlimitation should differ in different species of the same group will not\r\nsurprise any one who has studied the laws of inheritance, for they are\r\nso complex that they appear to us in our ignorance to be capricious in\r\ntheir action.[224]\r\n\r\nAs far as I can discover there are very few groups of birds containing a\r\nconsiderable number of species, in which all have both sexes brilliantly\r\ncoloured and alike; but this appears to be the case, as I hear from Mr.\r\nSclater, with the Musophagæ or plaintain-eaters. Nor do I believe that\r\nany large group exists in which the sexes of all the species are widely\r\ndissimilar in colour: Mr. Wallace informs me that the chatterers of S.\r\nAmerica (_Cotingidæ_) offer one of the best instances; but with some of\r\nthe species, in which the male has a splendid red breast, the female\r\nexhibits some red on her breast; and the females of other species shew\r\ntraces of the green and other colours of the males. Nevertheless we have\r\na near approach to close sexual similarity or dissimilarity throughout\r\nseveral groups: and this, from what has just been said of the\r\nfluctuating nature of inheritance, is a somewhat surprising\r\ncircumstance. But that the same laws should largely prevail with allied\r\nanimals is not surprising. The domestic fowl has produced a great\r\nnumber of breeds and sub-breeds, and in these the sexes generally differ\r\nin plumage; so that it has been noticed as a remarkable circumstance\r\nwhen in certain sub-breeds they resemble each other. On the other hand,\r\nthe domestic pigeon has likewise produced a vast number of distinct\r\nbreeds and sub-breeds, and in these, with rare exceptions, the two sexes\r\nare identically alike. Therefore if other species of Gallus and Columba\r\nwere domesticated and varied, it would not be rash to predict that the\r\nsame general rules of sexual similarity and dissimilarity, depending on\r\nthe form of transmission, would, in both cases, hold good. In a similar\r\nmanner the same form of transmission has generally prevailed throughout\r\nthe same natural groups, although marked exceptions to this rule occur.\r\nWithin the same family or even genus, the sexes may be identically alike\r\nor very different in colour. Instances have already been given relating\r\nto the same genus, as with sparrows, fly-catchers, thrushes and grouse.\r\nIn the family of pheasants the males and females of almost all the\r\nspecies are wonderfully dissimilar, but are quite similar in the eared\r\npheasant or _Crossoptilon auritum_. In two species of Chloephaga, a genus\r\nof geese, the males cannot be distinguished from the females, except by\r\nsize; whilst in two others, the sexes are so unlike that they might\r\neasily be mistaken for distinct species.[225]\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance can alone account for the following cases, in\r\nwhich the female by acquiring at a late period of life certain\r\ncharacters proper to the male, ultimately comes to resemble him in a\r\nmore or less complete manner. Here protection can hardly have come into\r\nplay. Mr. Blyth informs me that the females of _Oriolus melanocephalus_\r\nand of some allied species, when sufficiently mature to breed, differ\r\nconsiderably in plumage from the adult males; but after the second or\r\nthird moults they differ only in their beaks having a slight greenish\r\ntinge. In the dwarf bitterns (Ardetta), according to the same authority,\r\n“the male acquires his final livery at the first moult, the female not\r\nbefore the third or fourth moult; in the meanwhile she presents an\r\nintermediate garb, which is ultimately exchanged for the same livery as\r\nthat of the male.” So again the female _Falco peregrinus_ acquires her\r\nblue plumage more slowly than the male. Mr. Swinhoe states that with one\r\nof the Drongo shrikes (_Dicrurus macrocercus_) the male whilst almost a\r\nnestling, moults his soft brown plumage and becomes of a uniform glossy\r\ngreenish-black; but the female retains for a long time the white striæ\r\nand spots on the axillary feathers; and does not completely assume the\r\nuniform black colour of the male for the first three years. The same\r\nexcellent observer remarks that in the spring of the second year the\r\nfemale spoonbill (Platalea) of China resembles the male of the first\r\nyear, and that apparently it is not until the third spring that she\r\nacquires the same adult plumage as that possessed by the male at a much\r\nearlier age. The female _Bombycilla carolinensis_ differs very little\r\nfrom the male, but the appendages, which like beads of red sealing-wax\r\nornament the wing-feathers, are not developed in her so early in life as\r\nin the male. The upper mandible in the male of an Indian parrakeet\r\n(_Palæornis Javanicus_) is coral-red from his earliest youth, but in the\r\nfemale, as Mr. Blyth has observed with caged and wild birds, it is at\r\nfirst black and does not become red until the bird is at least a year\r\nold, at which age the sexes resemble each other in all respects. Both\r\nsexes of the wild turkey are ultimately furnished with a tuft of\r\nbristles on the breast, but in two-year-old birds the tuft is about four\r\ninches long in the male and hardly apparent in the female; when,\r\nhowever, the latter has reached her fourth year, it is from four to five\r\ninches in length.[226]\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the females follow a normal course of development in\r\nultimately becoming like the males; and such cases must not be\r\nconfounded with those in which diseased or old females assume masculine\r\ncharacters, or with those in which perfectly fertile females, whilst\r\nyoung, acquire through variation or some unknown cause the characters of\r\nthe male.[227] But all these cases have so much in common that they\r\ndepend, according to the hypothesis of pangenesis, on gemmules derived\r\nfrom each part of the male being present, though latent, in the female;\r\ntheir development following on some slight change in the elective\r\naffinities of her constituent tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words must be added on changes of plumage in relation to the\r\nseason of the year. From reasons formerly assigned there can be little\r\ndoubt that the elegant plumes, long pendant feathers, crests, &c., of\r\negrets, herons, and many other birds, which are developed and retained\r\nonly during the summer, serve exclusively for ornamental or nuptial\r\npurposes, though common to both sexes. The female is thus rendered more\r\nconspicuous during the period of incubation than during the winter; but\r\nsuch birds as herons and egrets would be able to defend themselves. As,\r\nhowever, plumes would probably be inconvenient and certainly of no use\r\nduring the winter, it is possible that the habit of moulting twice in\r\nthe year may have been gradually acquired through natural selection for\r\nthe sake of casting off inconvenient ornaments during the winter. But\r\nthis view cannot be extended to the many waders, in which the summer and\r\nwinter plumages differ very little in colour. With defenceless species,\r\nin which either both sexes or the males alone become extremely\r\nconspicuous during the breeding-season,—or when the males acquire at\r\nthis season such long wing or tail-feathers as to impede their flight,\r\nas with Cosmetornis and Vidua,—it certainly at first appears highly\r\nprobable that the second moult has been gained for the special purpose\r\nof throwing off these ornaments. We must, however, remember that many\r\nbirds, such as Birds of Paradise, the Argus pheasant and peacock, do not\r\ncast their plumes during the winter; and it can hardly be maintained\r\nthat there is something in the constitution of these birds, at least of\r\nthe Gallinaceæ, rendering a double moult impossible, for the ptarmigan\r\nmoults thrice in the year.[228] Hence it must be considered as doubtful\r\nwhether the many species which moult their ornamental plumes or lose\r\ntheir bright colours during the winter, have acquired this habit on\r\naccount of the inconvenience or danger which they would otherwise have\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nI conclude, therefore, that the habit of moulting twice in the year was\r\nin most or all cases first acquired for some distinct purpose, perhaps\r\nfor gaining a warmer winter covering; and that variations in the plumage\r\noccurring during the summer were accumulated through sexual selection,\r\nand transmitted to the offspring at the same season of the year. Such\r\nvariations being inherited either by both sexes or by the males alone,\r\naccording to the form of inheritance which prevailed. This appears more\r\nprobable than that these species in all cases originally tended to\r\nretain their ornamental plumage during the winter, but were saved from\r\nthis through natural selection, owing to the inconvenience or danger\r\nthus caused.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in this chapter to shew that the arguments are not\r\ntrustworthy in favour of the view that weapons, bright colours, and\r\nvarious ornaments, are now confined to the males owing to the\r\nconversion, by means of natural selection, of a tendency to the equal\r\ntransmission of characters to both sexes into transmission to the male\r\nsex alone. It is also doubtful whether the colours of many female birds\r\nare due to the preservation, for the sake of protection, of variations\r\nwhich were from the first limited in their transmission to the female\r\nsex. But it will be convenient to defer any further discussion on this\r\nsubject until I treat, in the following chapter, on the differences in\r\nplumage between the young and old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nBirds—_concluded_.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The immature plumage in relation to the character of the\r\n   plumage in both sexes when adult—Six classes of cases—Sexual\r\n   differences between the males of closely-allied or\r\n   representative species—The female assuming the characters of\r\n   the male—Plumage of the young in relation to the summer and\r\n   winter plumage of the adults—On the increase of beauty in the\r\n   Birds of the World—Protective\r\n   colouring—Conspicuously-coloured birds—Novelty\r\n   appreciated—Summary of the four chapters on Birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the transmission of characters as limited by age in\r\nreference to sexual selection. The truth and importance of the principle\r\nof inheritance at corresponding ages need not here be discussed, as\r\nenough has already been said on the subject. Before giving the several\r\nrather complex rules or classes of cases, under which all the\r\ndifferences in plumage between the young and the old, as far as known to\r\nme, may be included, it will be well to make a few preliminary remarks.\r\n\r\nWith animals of all kinds when the young differ in colour from the\r\nadults, and the colours of the former are not, as far as we can see, of\r\nany special service, they may generally be attributed, like various\r\nembryological structures, to the retention by the young of the character\r\nof an early progenitor. But this view can be maintained with confidence,\r\nonly when the young of several species closely resemble each other, and\r\nlikewise resemble other adult species belonging to the same group; for\r\nthe latter are the living proofs that such a state of things was\r\nformerly possible. Young lions and pumas are marked with feeble stripes\r\nor rows of spots, and as many allied species both young and old are\r\nsimilarly marked, no naturalist, who believes in the gradual evolution\r\nof species, will doubt that the progenitor of the lion and puma was a\r\nstriped animal, the young having retained vestiges of the stripes, like\r\nthe kittens of black cats, which when grown up are not in the least\r\nstriped. Many species of deer, which when mature are not spotted, are\r\nwhilst young covered with white spots, as are likewise some few species\r\nin their adult state. So again the young in the whole family of pigs\r\n(Suidæ), and in certain rather distantly-allied animals, such as the\r\ntapir, are marked with dark longitudinal stripes; but here we have a\r\ncharacter apparently derived from an extinct progenitor, and now\r\npreserved by the young alone. In all such cases the old have had their\r\ncolours changed in the course of time, whilst the young have remained\r\nbut little altered, and this has been effected through the principle of\r\ninheritance at corresponding ages.\r\n\r\nThis same principle applies to many birds belonging to various groups,\r\nin which the young closely resemble each other, and differ much from\r\ntheir respective adult parents. The young of almost all the Gallinaceæ,\r\nand of some distantly-allied birds such as ostriches, are whilst covered\r\nwith down longitudinally striped; but this character points back to a\r\nstate of things so remote that it hardly concerns us. Young crossbills\r\n(Loxia) have at first straight beaks like those of other finches, and in\r\ntheir immature striated plumage they resemble the mature redpole and\r\nfemale siskin, as well as the young of the goldfinch, greenfinch, and\r\nsome other allied species. The young of many kinds of buntings\r\n(Emberiza) resemble each other, and likewise the adult state of the\r\ncommon bunting, _E. miliaria_. In almost the whole large group of\r\nthrushes the young have their breasts spotted—a character which is\r\nretained by many species throughout life, but is quite lost by others,\r\nas by the _Turdus migratorius_. So again with many thrushes, the\r\nfeathers on the back are mottled before they are moulted for the first\r\ntime, and this character is retained for life by certain eastern\r\nspecies. The young of many species of shrikes (Lanius), of some\r\nwoodpeckers, and of an Indian pigeon (_Chalcophaps Indicus_), are\r\ntransversely striped on the under surface; and certain allied species or\r\ngenera when adult are similarly marked. In some closely-allied and\r\nresplendent Indian cuckoos (Chrysococcyx), the species when mature\r\ndiffer considerably from each other in colour, but the young cannot be\r\ndistinguished. The young of an Indian goose (_Sarkidiornis melanonotus_)\r\nclosely resemble in plumage an allied genus, Dendrocygna, when\r\nmature.[229] Similar facts will hereafter be given in regard to certain\r\nherons. Young black grouse (_Tetrao tetrix_) resemble the young as well\r\nas the old of certain other species, for instance the red grouse or _T.\r\nscoticus_. Finally, as Mr. Blyth, who has attended closely to this\r\nsubject, has well remarked, the natural affinities of many species are\r\nbest exhibited in their immature plumage; and as the true affinities of\r\nall organic beings depend on their descent from a common progenitor,\r\nthis remark strongly confirms the belief that the immature plumage\r\napproximately shews us the former or ancestral condition of the species.\r\n\r\nAlthough many young birds belonging to various orders thus give us a\r\nglimpse of the plumage of their remote progenitors, yet there are many\r\nother birds, both dull-coloured and bright-coloured, in which the young\r\nclosely resemble their parents. With such species the young of the\r\ndifferent species cannot resemble each other more closely than do the\r\nparents; nor can they present striking resemblances to allied forms in\r\ntheir adult state. They give us but little insight into the plumage of\r\ntheir progenitors, excepting in so far that when the young and the old\r\nare coloured in the same general manner throughout a whole group of\r\nspecies, it is probable that their progenitors were similarly coloured.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the classes of cases or rules under which the\r\ndifferences and resemblances, between the plumage of the young and the\r\nold, of both sexes or of one sex alone, may be grouped. Rules of this\r\nkind were first enounced by Cuvier; but with the progress of knowledge\r\nthey require some modification and amplification. This I have attempted\r\nto do, as far as the extreme complexity of the subject permits, from\r\ninformation derived from various sources; but a full essay on this\r\nsubject by some competent ornithologist is much needed. In order to\r\nascertain to what extent each rule prevails, I have tabulated the facts\r\ngiven in four great works, namely, by Macgillivray on the birds of\r\nBritain, Audubon on those of North America, Jerdon on those of India,\r\nand Gould on those of Australia. I may here premise, firstly, that the\r\nseveral cases or rules graduate into each other; and secondly, that when\r\nthe young are said to resemble their parents, it is not meant that they\r\nare identically alike, for their colours are almost always rather less\r\nvivid, and the feathers are softer and often of a different shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES OR CLASSES OF CASES.\r\n\r\nI. When the adult male is more beautiful or conspicuous than the adult\r\nfemale, the young of both sexes in their first plumage closely resemble\r\nthe adult female, as with the common fowl and peacock; or, as\r\noccasionally occurs, they resemble her much more closely than they do\r\nthe adult male.\r\n\r\nII. When the adult female is more conspicuous than the adult male, as\r\nsometimes though rarely occurs, the young of both sexes in their first\r\nplumage resemble the adult male.\r\n\r\nIII. When the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of both\r\nsexes have a peculiar first plumage of their own, as with the robin.\r\n\r\nIV. When the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of both\r\nsexes in their first plumage resemble the adults, as with the\r\nkingfisher, many parrots, crows, hedge-warblers.\r\n\r\nV. When the adults of both sexes have a distinct winter and summer\r\nplumage, whether or not the male differs from the female, the young\r\nresemble the adults of both sexes in their winter dress, or much more\r\nrarely in their summer dress, or they resemble the females alone; or the\r\nyoung may have an intermediate character; or again they may differ\r\ngreatly from the adults in both their seasonal plumages.\r\n\r\nVI. In some few cases the young in their first plumage differ from each\r\nother according to sex; the young males resembling more or less closely\r\nthe adult males, and the young females more or less closely the adult\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nCLASS I.—In this class, the young of both sexes resemble, more or less\r\nclosely, the adult female, whilst the adult male differs, often in the\r\nmost conspicuous manner, from the adult female. Innumerable instances\r\nin all Orders could be given; it will suffice to call to mind the common\r\npheasant, duck, and house-sparrow. The cases under this class graduate\r\ninto others. Thus the two sexes when adult may differ so slightly, and\r\nthe young so slightly from the adults, that it is doubtful whether such\r\ncases ought to come under the present, or under the third or fourth\r\nclasses. So again the young of both sexes, instead of being quite alike,\r\nmay differ in a slight degree from each other, as in our sixth class.\r\nThese transitional cases, however, are few in number, or at least are\r\nnot strongly pronounced, in comparison with those which come strictly\r\nunder the present class.\r\n\r\nThe force of the present law is well shewn in those groups, in which, as\r\na general rule, the two sexes and the young are all alike; for when the\r\nmale in these groups does differ from the female, as with certain\r\nparrots, kingfishers, pigeons, &c., the young of both sexes resemble the\r\nadult female.[230] We see the same fact exhibited still more clearly in\r\ncertain anomalous cases; thus the male of _Heliothrix auriculata_ (one\r\nof the humming-birds) differs conspicuously from the female in having a\r\nsplendid gorget and fine ear-tufts, but the female is remarkable from\r\nhaving a much longer tail than that of the male; now the young of both\r\nsexes resemble (with the exception of the breast being spotted with\r\nbronze) the adult female in all respects including the length of her\r\ntail, so that the tail of the male actually becomes shorter as he\r\nreaches maturity, which is a most unusual circumstance.[231] Again, the\r\nplumage of the male goosander (_Mergus merganser_) is more conspicuously\r\ncoloured, with the scapular and secondary wing-feathers much longer than\r\nin the female, but differently from what occurs, as far as I know, in\r\nany other bird, the crest of the adult male, though broader than that of\r\nthe female, is considerably shorter, being only a little above an inch\r\nin length; the crest of the female being two and a half inches long. Now\r\nthe young of both sexes resemble in all respects the adult female, so\r\nthat their crests are actually of greater length though narrower than in\r\nthe adult male.[232]\r\n\r\nWhen the young and the females closely resemble each other and both\r\ndiffer from the male, the most obvious conclusion is that the male alone\r\nhas been modified. Even in the anomalous cases of the Heliothrix and\r\nMergus, it is probable that originally both adult sexes were furnished,\r\nthe one species with a much elongated tail, and the other with a much\r\nelongated crest, these characters having since been partially lost by\r\nthe adult males from some unexplained cause, and transmitted in their\r\ndiminished state to their male offspring alone, when arrived at the\r\ncorresponding age of maturity. The belief that in the present class the\r\nmale alone has been modified, as far as the differences between the male\r\nand the female together with her young are concerned, is strongly\r\nsupported by some remarkable facts recorded by Mr. Blyth,[233] with\r\nrespect to closely-allied species which represent each other in distinct\r\ncountries. For with several of these representative species the adult\r\nmales have undergone a certain amount of change and can be\r\ndistinguished; the females and the young being undistinguishable, and\r\ntherefore absolutely unchanged. This is the case with certain Indian\r\nchats (Thamnobia), with certain honey-suckers (Nectarinia), shrikes\r\n(Tephrodornis), certain kingfishers (Tanysiptera), Kallij pheasants\r\n(Gallophasis), and tree-partridges (Arboricola).\r\n\r\nIn some analogous cases, namely with birds having a distinct summer and\r\nwinter plumage, but with the two sexes nearly alike, certain\r\nclosely-allied species can easily be distinguished in their summer or\r\nnuptial plumage, yet are undistinguishable in their winter as well as in\r\ntheir immature plumage. This is the case with some of the closely-allied\r\nIndian wagtails or Motacillæ. Mr. Swinhoe[234] informs me that three\r\nspecies of Ardeola, a genus of herons, which represent each other on\r\nseparate continents, are “most strikingly different” when ornamented\r\nwith their summer plumes, but are hardly, if at all, distinguishable\r\nduring the winter. The young also of these three species in their\r\nimmature plumage closely resemble the adults in their winter dress. This\r\ncase is all the more interesting because with two other species of\r\nArdeola both sexes retain, during the winter and summer, nearly the same\r\nplumage as that possessed by the three first species during the winter\r\nand in their immature state; and this plumage, which is common to\r\nseveral distinct species at different ages and seasons, probably shews\r\nus how the progenitor of the genus was coloured. In all these cases, the\r\nnuptial plumage which we may assume was originally acquired by the adult\r\nmales during the breeding-season, and transmitted to the adults of both\r\nsexes at the corresponding season, has been modified, whilst the winter\r\nand immature plumages have been left unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, how is it that in these latter cases the\r\nwinter plumage of both sexes, and in the former cases the plumage of the\r\nadult females, as well as the immature plumage of the young, have not\r\nbeen at all affected? The species which represent each other in distinct\r\ncountries will almost always have been exposed to somewhat different\r\nconditions, but we can hardly attribute the modification of the plumage\r\nin the males alone to this action, seeing that the females and the\r\nyoung, though similarly exposed, have not been affected. Hardly any fact\r\nin nature shews us more clearly how subordinate in importance is the\r\ndirect action of the conditions of life, in comparison with the\r\naccumulation through selection of indefinite variations, than the\r\nsurprising difference between the sexes of many birds; for both sexes\r\nmust have consumed the same food and have been exposed to the same\r\nclimate. Nevertheless we are not precluded from believing that in the\r\ncourse of time new conditions may produce some direct effect; we see\r\nonly that this is subordinate in importance to the accumulated results\r\nof selection. When, however, a species migrates into a new country, and\r\nthis must precede the formation of representative species, the changed\r\nconditions to which they will almost always have been exposed will\r\ncause them to undergo, judging from a widely-spread analogy, a certain\r\namount of fluctuating variability. In this case sexual selection, which\r\ndepends on an element eminently liable to change—namely the taste or\r\nadmiration of the female—will have had new shades of colour or other\r\ndifferences to act on and accumulate; and as sexual selection is always\r\nat work, it would (judging from what we know of the results on domestic\r\nanimals of man’s unintentional selection), be a surprising fact if\r\nanimals inhabiting separate districts, which can never cross and thus\r\nblend their newly-acquired characters, were not, after a sufficient\r\nlapse of time, differently modified. These remarks likewise apply to the\r\nnuptial or summer plumage, whether confined to the males or common to\r\nboth sexes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the females of the above closely-allied species, together with\r\ntheir young, differ hardly at all from each other, so that the males\r\nalone can be distinguished, yet in most cases the females of the species\r\nwithin the same genus obviously differ from each other. The differences,\r\nhowever, are rarely as great as between the males. We see this clearly\r\nin the whole family of the Gallinaceæ: the females, for instance, of the\r\ncommon and Japan pheasant, and especially of the gold and Amherst\r\npheasant—of the silver pheasant and the wild fowl—resemble each other\r\nvery closely in colour, whilst the males differ to an extraordinary\r\ndegree. So it is with the females of most of the Cotingidæ, Fringillidæ,\r\nand many other families. There can indeed be no doubt that, as a general\r\nrule, the females have been modified to a less extent than the males.\r\nSome few birds, however, offer a singular and inexplicable exception;\r\nthus the females of _Paradisea apoda_ and _P. papuana_ differ from each\r\nother more than do their respective males;[235] the female of the\r\nlatter species having the under surface pure white, whilst the female\r\n_P. apoda_ is deep brown beneath. So, again, as I hear from Professor\r\nNewton, the males of two species of Oxynotus (shrikes), which represent\r\neach other in the islands of Mauritius and Bourbon,[236] differ but\r\nlittle in colour, whilst the females differ much. In the Bourbon species\r\nthe female appears to have partially retained an immature condition of\r\nplumage, for at first sight she “might be taken for the young of the\r\nMauritian species.” These differences may be compared with those which\r\noccur, independently of selection by man, and which we cannot explain,\r\nin certain sub-breeds of the game-fowl, in which the females are very\r\ndifferent, whilst the males can hardly be distinguished.[237]\r\n\r\nAs I account so largely by sexual selection for the differences between\r\nthe males of allied species, how can the differences between the females\r\nbe accounted for in all ordinary cases? We need not here consider the\r\nspecies which belong to distinct genera; for with these, adaptation to\r\ndifferent habits of life, and other agencies, will have come into play.\r\nIn regard to the differences between the females within the same genus,\r\nit appears to me almost certain, after looking through various large\r\ngroups, that the chief agent has been the transference, in a greater or\r\nless degree, to the female of the characters acquired by the males\r\nthrough sexual selection. In the several British finches, the two sexes\r\ndiffer either very slightly or considerably; and if we compare the\r\nfemales of the greenfinch, chaffinch, goldfinch, bullfinch, crossbill,\r\nsparrow, &c., we shall see that they differ from each other chiefly in\r\nthe points in which they partially resemble their respective males; and\r\nthe colours of the males may safely be attributed to sexual selection.\r\nWith many gallinaceous species the sexes differ to an extreme degree, as\r\nwith the peacock, pheasant, and fowl, whilst with other species there\r\nhas been a partial or even complete transference of character from the\r\nmale to the female. The females of the several species of Polyplectron\r\nexhibit in a dim condition, and chiefly on the tail, the splendid ocelli\r\nof their males. The female partridge differs from the male only in the\r\nred mark on her breast being smaller; and the female wild turkey only in\r\nher colours being much duller. In the guinea-fowl the two sexes are\r\nundistinguishable. There is no improbability in the plain, though\r\npeculiar spotted plumage of this latter bird having been acquired\r\nthrough sexual selection by the males, and then transmitted to both\r\nsexes; for it is not essentially different from the much more\r\nbeautifully-spotted plumage, characteristic of the males alone of the\r\nTragopan pheasants.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that, in some instances, the transference of\r\ncharacters from the male to the female has been effected apparently at a\r\nremote period, the male having subsequently undergone great changes,\r\nwithout transferring to the female any of his later-gained characters.\r\nFor instance, the female and the young of the black-grouse (_Tetrao\r\ntetrix_) resemble pretty closely both sexes and the young of the\r\nred-grouse _T. Scoticus_; and we may consequently infer that the\r\nblack-grouse is descended from some ancient species, of which both sexes\r\nwere coloured in nearly the same manner as the red-grouse. As both sexes\r\nof this latter species are more plainly barred during the\r\nbreeding-season than at any other time, and as the male differs\r\nslightly from the female in his more strongly-pronounced red and brown\r\ntints,[238] we may conclude that his plumage has been, at least to a\r\ncertain extent, influenced by sexual selection. If so, we may further\r\ninfer that the nearly similar plumage of the female black-grouse was\r\nsimilarly produced at some former period. But since this period the male\r\nblack-grouse has acquired his fine black plumage, with his forked and\r\noutwardly-curled tail-feathers; but of these characters there has hardly\r\nbeen any transference to the female, excepting that she shews in her\r\ntail a trace of the curved fork.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore conclude that the females of distinct though allied\r\nspecies have often had their plumage rendered more or less different by\r\nthe transference in various degrees, of characters acquired, both during\r\nformer and recent times, by the males through sexual selection. But it\r\ndeserves especial attention that brilliant colours have been transferred\r\nmuch more rarely than other tints. For instance, the male of the\r\nred-throated bluebreast (_Cyanecula suecica_) has a rich blue breast,\r\nincluding a sub-triangular red mark; now marks of approximately the same\r\nshape have been transferred to the female, but the central space is\r\nfulvous instead of red, and is surrounded by mottled instead of blue\r\nfeathers. The Gallinaceæ offer many analogous cases; for none of the\r\nspecies, such as partridges, quails, guinea-fowls, &c., in which the\r\ncolours of the plumage have been largely transferred from the male to\r\nthe female, are brilliantly coloured. This is well exemplified with the\r\npheasants, in which the male is generally so much more brilliant than\r\nthe female; but with the Eared and Cheer pheasants (_Crossoptilon_\r\n_auritum_ and _Phasianus Wallichii_) the two sexes closely resemble each\r\nother and their colours are dull. We may go so far as to believe that if\r\nany part of the plumage in the males of these two pheasants had been\r\nbrilliantly coloured, this would not have been transferred to the\r\nfemales. These facts strongly support Mr. Wallace’s view that with birds\r\nwhich are exposed to much danger during nidification, the transference\r\nof bright colours from the male to the female has been checked through\r\nnatural selection. We must not, however, forget that another\r\nexplanation, before given, is possible; namely, that the males which\r\nvaried and became bright, whilst they were young and inexperienced,\r\nwould have been exposed to much danger, and would generally have been\r\ndestroyed; the older and more cautious males, on the other hand, if they\r\nvaried in a like manner, would not only have been able to survive, but\r\nwould have been favoured in their rivalry with other males. Now\r\nvariations occurring late in life tend to be transmitted exclusively to\r\nthe same sex, so that in this case extremely bright tints would not have\r\nbeen transmitted to the females. On the other hand, ornaments of a less\r\nconspicuous kind, such as those possessed by the Eared and Cheer\r\npheasants, would not have been dangerous, and if they appeared during\r\nearly youth, would generally have been transmitted to both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the effects of the partial transference of characters\r\nfrom the males to the females, some of the differences between the\r\nfemales of closely-allied species may be attributed to the direct or\r\ndefinite action of the conditions of life.[239] With the males any such\r\naction would generally have been masked by the brilliant colours gained\r\nthrough sexual selection; but not so with the females. Each of the\r\nendless diversities in plumage, which we see in our domesticated birds\r\nis, of course, the result of some definite cause; and under natural and\r\nmore uniform conditions, some one tint, assuming that it was in no way\r\ninjurious, would almost certainly sooner or later prevail. The free\r\nintercrossing of the many individuals belonging to the same species\r\nwould ultimately tend to make any change of colour, thus induced,\r\nuniform in character.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts that both sexes of many birds have had their colours\r\nadapted for the sake of protection; and it is possible that the females\r\nalone of some species may have been thus modified. Although it would be\r\na difficult, perhaps an impossible process, as shewn in the last\r\nchapter, to convert through selection one form of transmission into\r\nanother, there would not be the least difficulty in adapting the colours\r\nof the female, independently of those of the male, to surrounding\r\nobjects, through the accumulation of variations which were from the\r\nfirst limited in their transmission to the female sex. If the variations\r\nwere not thus limited, the bright tints of the male would be\r\ndeteriorated or destroyed. Whether the females alone of many species\r\nhave been thus specially modified, is at present very doubtful. I wish I\r\ncould follow Mr. Wallace to the full extent; for the admission would\r\nremove some difficulties. Any variations which were of no service to the\r\nfemale as a protection would be at once obliterated, instead of being\r\nlost simply by not being selected, or from free intercrossing, or from\r\nbeing eliminated when transferred to the male and in any way injurious\r\nto him. Thus the plumage of the female would be kept constant in\r\ncharacter. It would also be a relief if we could admit that the obscure\r\ntints of both sexes of many birds had been acquired and preserved for\r\nthe sake of protection,—for example, of the hedge-warbler or kitty-wren\r\n(_Accentor modularis_ and _Troglodytes vulgaris_), with respect to which\r\nwe have no sufficient evidence of the action of sexual selection. We\r\nought, however, to be cautious in concluding that colours which appear\r\nto us dull, are not attractive to the females of certain species; we\r\nshould bear in mind such cases as that of the common house-sparrow, in\r\nwhich the male differs much from the female, but does not exhibit any\r\nbright tints. No one probably will dispute that many gallinaceous birds\r\nwhich live on the open ground have acquired their present colours, at\r\nleast in part, for the sake of protection. We know how well they are\r\nthus concealed; we know that ptarmigans, whilst changing from their\r\nwinter to their summer plumage, both of which are protective, suffer\r\ngreatly from birds of prey. But can we believe that the very slight\r\ndifferences in tints and markings between, for instance, the female\r\nblack and red-grouse serve as a protection? Are partridges, as they are\r\nnow coloured, better protected than if they had resembled quails? Do the\r\nslight differences between the females of the common pheasant, the Japan\r\nand golden pheasants, serve as a protection, or might not their plumages\r\nhave been interchanged with impunity? From what Mr. Wallace has observed\r\nof the habits of certain gallinaceous birds in the East he thinks that\r\nsuch slight differences are beneficial. For myself, I will only say that\r\nI am not convinced.\r\n\r\nFormerly when I was inclined to lay much stress on the principle of\r\nprotection, as accounting for the less bright colours of female birds,\r\nit occurred to me that possibly both sexes and the young might\r\naboriginally have been brightly coloured in an equal degree; but that\r\nsubsequently, the females from the danger incurred during incubation,\r\nand the young from being inexperienced, had been rendered dull as a\r\nprotection. But this view is not supported by any evidence, and is not\r\nprobable; for we thus in imagination expose during past times the\r\nfemales and the young to danger, from which it has subsequently been\r\nnecessary to shield their modified descendants. We have, also, to\r\nreduce, through a gradual process of selection, the females and the\r\nyoung to almost exactly the same tints and markings, and to transmit\r\nthem to the corresponding sex and period of life. It is also a somewhat\r\nstrange fact, on the supposition that the females and the young have\r\npartaken during each stage of the process of modification of a tendency\r\nto be as brightly coloured as the males, that the females have never\r\nbeen rendered dull-coloured without the young participating in the same\r\nchange; for there are no instances, as far as I can discover, of species\r\nwith the females dull-coloured and the young bright-coloured. A partial\r\nexception, however, is offered by the young of certain woodpeckers, for\r\nthey have “the whole upper part of the head tinged with red,” which\r\nafterwards either decreases into a mere circular red line in the adults\r\nof both sexes, or quite disappears in the adult females.[240]\r\n\r\nFinally, with respect to our present class of cases, the most probable\r\nview appears to be that successive variations in brightness or in other\r\nornamental characters, occurring in the males at a rather late period of\r\nlife have alone been preserved; and that most or all of these variations\r\nowing to the late period of life at which they appeared, have been from\r\nthe first transmitted only to the adult male offspring. Any variations\r\nin brightness which occurred in the females or in the young would have\r\nbeen of no service to them, and would not have been selected; moreover,\r\nif dangerous, would have been eliminated. Thus the females and the young\r\nwill either have been left unmodified, or, and this has much more\r\ncommonly occurred, will have been partially modified by receiving\r\nthrough transference from the males some of the successive variations.\r\nBoth sexes have perhaps been directly acted on by the conditions of life\r\nto which they have long been exposed; but the females from not being\r\notherwise much modified will best exhibit any such effects. These\r\nchanges and all others will have been kept uniform by the free\r\nintercrossing of many individuals. In some cases, especially with ground\r\nbirds, the females and the young may possibly have been modified,\r\nindependently of the males, for the sake of protection, so as to have\r\nacquired the same dull-coloured plumage.\r\n\r\nCLASS II. _When the adult female is more conspicuous than the adult\r\nmale, the young of both sexes in their first plumage resemble the adult\r\nmale._—This class is exactly the reverse of the last, for the females\r\nare here more brightly coloured or more conspicuous than the males; and\r\nthe young, as far as they are known, resemble the adult males instead of\r\nthe adult females. But the difference between the sexes is never nearly\r\nso great as occurs with many birds in the first class, and the cases are\r\ncomparatively rare. Mr. Wallace who first called attention to the\r\nsingular relation which exists between the less bright colours of the\r\nmales and their performing the duties of incubation, lays great stress\r\non this point,[241] as a crucial test that obscure colours have been\r\nacquired for the sake of protection during the period of nesting. A\r\ndifferent view seems to me more probable. As the cases are curious and\r\nnot numerous, I will briefly give all that I have been able to find.\r\n\r\nIn one section of the genus Turnix, quail-like birds, the female is\r\ninvariably larger than the male (being nearly twice as large in one of\r\nthe Australian species) and this is an unusual circumstance with the\r\nGallinaceæ. In most of the species the female is more distinctly\r\ncoloured and brighter than the male,[242] but in some few species the\r\nsexes are alike. In _Turnix taigoor_ of India the male “wants the black\r\non the throat and neck, and the whole tone of the plumage is lighter and\r\nless pronounced than that of the female.” The female appears to be more\r\nvociferous, and is certainly much more pugnacious than the male; so that\r\nthe females and not the males are often kept by the natives for\r\nfighting, like game-cocks. As male birds are exposed by the English\r\nbird-catchers for a decoy near a trap, in order to catch other males by\r\nexciting their rivalry, so the females of this Turnix are employed in\r\nIndia. When thus exposed the females soon begin their “loud purring\r\ncall, which can be heard a long way off, and any females within ear-shot\r\nrun rapidly to the spot, and commence fighting with the caged bird.” In\r\nthis way from twelve to twenty birds, all breeding-females, may be\r\ncaught in the course of a single day. The natives assert that the\r\nfemales after laying their eggs associate in flocks, and leave the males\r\nto sit on them. There is no reason to doubt the truth of this assertion,\r\nwhich is supported by some observations made in China by Mr.\r\nSwinhoe.[243] Mr. Blyth believes, that the young of both sexes resemble\r\nthe adult male.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Rhynchæa capensis (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nThe females of the three species of Painted Snipes (Rhynchæa) “are not\r\nonly larger, but much more richly coloured than the males.”[244] With\r\nall other birds, in which the trachea differs in structure in the two\r\nsexes it is more developed and complex in the male than in the female;\r\nbut in the _Rhynchæa Australis_ it is simple in the male, whilst in the\r\nfemale it makes four distinct convolutions before entering the\r\nlungs.[245] The female therefore of this species has acquired an\r\neminently masculine character. Mr. Blyth ascertained, by examining many\r\nspecimens, that the trachea is not convoluted in either sex of _R.\r\nBengalensis_, which species so closely resembles _R. Australis_ that it\r\ncan hardly be distinguished except by its shorter toes. This fact is\r\nanother striking instance of the law that secondary sexual characters\r\nare often widely different in closely-allied forms; though it is a very\r\nrare circumstance when such differences relate to the female sex. The\r\nyoung of both sexes of _R. Bengalensis_ in their first plumage are said\r\nto resemble the mature male.[246] There is also reason to believe that\r\nthe male undertakes the duty of incubation, for Mr. Swinhoe[247] found\r\nthe females before the close of the summer associated in flocks, as\r\noccurs with the females of the Turnix.\r\n\r\nThe females of _Phalaropus fulicarius_ and _P. hyperboreus_ are larger,\r\nand in their summer plumage “more gaily attired than the males.” But the\r\ndifference in colour between the sexes is far from conspicuous. The male\r\nalone of _P. fulicarius_ undertakes, according to Professor Steenstrup,\r\nthe duty of incubation, as is likewise shewn by the state of his\r\nbreast-feathers during the breeding-season. The female of the dotterel\r\nplover (_Eudromias morinellus_) is larger than the male, and has the red\r\nand black tints on the lower surface, the white crescent on the breast,\r\nand the stripes over the eyes, more strongly pronounced. The male also\r\ntakes at least a share in hatching the eggs; but the female likewise\r\nattends to the young.[248] I have not been able to discover whether with\r\nthese species the young resemble the adult males more closely than the\r\nadult females; for the comparison is somewhat difficult to make on\r\naccount of the double moult.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Ostrich order: the male of the common cassowary\r\n(_Casuarius galeatus_) would be thought by any one to be the female,\r\nfrom his smaller size and from the appendages and naked skin about his\r\nhead being much less brightly coloured; and I am informed by Mr.\r\nBartlett that in the Zoological Gardens it is certainly the male alone\r\nwho sits on the eggs and takes care of the young.[249] The female is\r\nsaid by Mr. T. W. Wood[250] to exhibit during the breeding-season a most\r\npugnacious disposition; and her wattles then become enlarged and more\r\nbrilliantly coloured. So again the female of one of the emus\r\n(_Dromœus irroratus_) is considerably larger than the male, and she\r\npossesses a slight top-knot, but is otherwise undistinguishable in\r\nplumage. She appears, however, “to have greater power, when angry or\r\notherwise excited, of erecting, like a turkey-cock, the feathers of her\r\nneck and breast. She is usually the more courageous and pugilistic. She\r\nmakes a deep hollow guttural boom, especially at night, sounding like a\r\nsmall gong. The male has a slenderer frame and is more docile, with no\r\nvoice beyond a suppressed hiss when angry, or a croak.” He not only\r\nperforms the whole duty of incubation, but has to defend the young from\r\ntheir mother; “for as soon as she catches sight of her progeny she\r\nbecomes violently agitated, and notwithstanding the resistance of the\r\nfather appears to use her utmost endeavours to destroy them. For months\r\nafterwards it is unsafe to put the parents together, violent quarrels\r\nbeing the inevitable result, in which the female generally comes off\r\nconqueror.”[251] So that with this emu we have a complete reversal not\r\nonly of the parental and incubating instincts, but of the usual moral\r\nqualities of the two sexes; the females being savage, quarrelsome and\r\nnoisy, the males gentle and good. The case is very different with the\r\nAfrican ostrich, for the male is somewhat larger than the female and has\r\nfiner plumes with more strongly contrasted colours; nevertheless he\r\nundertakes the whole duty of incubation.[252]\r\n\r\nI will specify the few other cases known to me, in which the female is\r\nmore conspicuously coloured than the male, although nothing is known\r\nabout their manner of incubation. With the carrion-hawk of the Falkland\r\nIslands (_Milvago leucurus_) I was much surprised to find by dissection\r\nthat the individuals, which had all their tints strongly pronounced,\r\nwith the cere and legs orange-coloured, were the adult females; whilst\r\nthose with duller plumage and grey legs were the males or the young. In\r\nan Australian tree-creeper (_Climacteris erythrops_) the female differs\r\nfrom the male in “being adorned with beautiful, radiated, rufous\r\nmarkings on the throat, the male having this part quite plain.” Lastly\r\nin an Australian nightjar “the female always exceeds the male in size\r\nand in the brilliance of her tints; the males, on the other hand, have\r\ntwo white spots on the primaries more conspicuous than in the\r\nfemale.”[253]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the cases in which female birds are more conspicuously\r\ncoloured than the males, with the young in their immature plumage\r\nresembling the adult males instead of the adult females, as in the\r\nprevious class, are not numerous, though they are distributed in various\r\nOrders. The amount of difference, also, between the sexes is\r\nincomparably less than that which frequently occurs in the last class;\r\nso that the cause of the difference, whatever it may have been, has\r\nacted on the females in the present class either less energetically or\r\nless persistently than on the males in the last class. Mr. Wallace\r\nbelieves that the males have had their colours rendered less\r\nconspicuous for the sake of protection during the period of incubation;\r\nbut the difference between the sexes in hardly any of the foregoing\r\ncases appears sufficiently great for this view to be safely accepted. In\r\nsome of the cases the brighter tints of the female are almost confined\r\nto the lower surface, and the males, if thus coloured, would not have\r\nbeen exposed to danger whilst sitting on the eggs. It should also be\r\nborne in mind that the males are not only in a slight degree less\r\nconspicuously coloured than the females, but are of less size, and have\r\nless strength. They have, moreover, not only acquired the maternal\r\ninstinct of incubation, but are less pugnacious and vociferous than the\r\nfemales, and in one instance have simpler vocal organs. Thus an almost\r\ncomplete transposition of the instincts, habits, disposition, colour,\r\nsize, and of some points of structure, has been effected between the two\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\nNow if we might assume that the males in the present class have lost\r\nsome of that ardour which is usual to their sex, so that they no longer\r\nsearch eagerly for the females; or, if we might assume that the females\r\nhave become much more numerous than the males—and in the case of one\r\nIndian Turnix the females are said to be “much more commonly met with\r\nthan the males”[254]—then it is not improbable that the females would\r\nhave been led to court the males, instead of being courted by them. This\r\nindeed is the case to a certain extent, with some birds, as we have seen\r\nwith the peahen, wild turkey, and certain kinds of grouse. Taking as our\r\nguide the habits of most male birds, the greater size and strength and\r\nthe extraordinary pugnacity of the females of the Turnix and Emu, must\r\nmean that they endeavour to drive away rival females, in order to gain\r\npossession of the male; and on this view, all the facts become clear;\r\nfor the males would probably be most charmed or excited by the females\r\nwhich were the most attractive to them by their brighter colours, other\r\nornaments, or vocal powers. Sexual selection would then soon do its\r\nwork, steadily adding to the attractions of the females; the males and\r\nthe young being left not at all, or but little modified.\r\n\r\nCLASS III. _When the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of\r\nboth sexes have a peculiar first plumage of their own._—In this class\r\nboth sexes when adult resemble each other, and differ from the young.\r\nThis occurs with many birds of many kinds. The male robin can hardly be\r\ndistinguished from the female, but the young are widely different with\r\ntheir mottled dusky-olive and brown plumage. The male and female of the\r\nsplendid scarlet Ibis are alike, whilst the young are brown; and the\r\nscarlet-colour, though common to both sexes, is apparently a sexual\r\ncharacter, for it is not well developed with birds under confinement, in\r\nthe same manner as often occurs in the case of brilliantly coloured male\r\nbirds. With many species of herons the young differ greatly from the\r\nadults, and their summer plumage, though common to both sexes, clearly\r\nhas a nuptial character. Young swans are slate-coloured, whilst the\r\nmature birds are pure white; but it would be superfluous to give\r\nadditional instances. These differences between the young and the old\r\napparently depend, as in the two last classes, on the young having\r\nretained a former or ancient state of plumage, which has been exchanged\r\nfor a new plumage by the old of both sexes. When the adults are brightly\r\ncoloured, we may conclude from the remarks just made in relation to the\r\nscarlet ibis and to many herons, and from the analogy of the species in\r\nthe first class, that such colours have been acquired through sexual\r\nselection by the nearly mature males; but that, differently from what\r\noccurs in the two first classes, the transmission, though limited to the\r\nsame age, has not been limited to the same sex. Consequently both sexes\r\nwhen mature resemble each other and differ from the young.\r\n\r\nCLASS IV. _When the adult male resembles the adult female, the young of\r\nboth sexes in their first plumage resemble the adults._—In this class\r\nthe young and the adults of both sexes, whether brilliantly or obscurely\r\ncoloured, resemble each other. Such cases are, I think, more common than\r\nthose in the last class. We have in England instances in the kingfisher,\r\nsome woodpeckers, the jay, magpie, crow, and many small dull-coloured\r\nbirds, such as the hedge-warbler or kitty-wren. But the similarity in\r\nplumage between the young and the old is never absolutely complete, and\r\ngraduates away into dissimilarity. Thus the young of some members of the\r\nkingfisher family are not only less vividly coloured than the adults,\r\nbut many of the feathers on the lower surface are edged with\r\nbrown,[255]—a vestige probably of a former state of the plumage.\r\nFrequently in the same group of birds, even within the same genus, for\r\ninstance in an Australian genus of parrokeets (Platycercus), the young\r\nof some species closely resemble, whilst the young of other species\r\ndiffer considerably from their parents of both sexes, which are\r\nalike.[256] Both sexes and the young of the common jay are closely\r\nsimilar; but in the Canada jay (_Perisoreus canadensis_) the young\r\ndiffer so much from their parents that they were formerly described as\r\ndistinct species.[257]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, I may remark that under the present and two next\r\nclasses of cases the facts are so complex, and the conclusions so\r\ndoubtful, that any one who feels no especial interest in the subject had\r\nbetter pass them over.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant or conspicuous colours which characterise many birds in\r\nthe present class, can rarely or never be of service to them as a\r\nprotection; so that they have probably been gained by the males through\r\nsexual selection, and then transferred to the females and the young. It\r\nis, however, possible that the males may have selected the more\r\nattractive females; and if these transmitted their characters to their\r\noffspring of both sexes, the same results would follow as from the\r\nselection of the more attractive males by the females. But there is some\r\nevidence that this contingency has rarely, if ever, occurred in any of\r\nthose groups of birds, in which the sexes are generally alike; for if\r\neven a few of the successive variations had failed to be transmitted to\r\nboth sexes, the females would have exceeded to a slight degree the males\r\nin beauty. Exactly the reverse occurs under nature; for in almost every\r\nlarge group, in which the sexes generally resemble each other, the males\r\nof some few species are in a slight degree more brightly coloured than\r\nthe females. It is again possible that the females may have selected the\r\nmore beautiful males, these males having reciprocally selected the more\r\nbeautiful females; but it is doubtful whether this double process of\r\nselection would be likely to occur, owing to the greater eagerness of\r\none sex than the other, and whether it would be more efficient than\r\nselection on one side alone. It is, therefore, the most probable view\r\nthat sexual selection has acted, in the present class, as far as\r\nornamental characters are concerned, in accordance with the general\r\nrule throughout the animal kingdom, that is, on the males; and that\r\nthese have transmitted their gradually-acquired colours, either equally\r\nor almost equally, to their offspring of both sexes.\r\n\r\nAnother point is more doubtful, namely, whether the successive\r\nvariations first appeared in the males after they had become nearly\r\nmature, or whilst quite young. In either case sexual selection must have\r\nacted on the male when he had to compete with rivals for the possession\r\nof the female; and in both cases the characters thus acquired have been\r\ntransmitted to both sexes and all ages. But these characters, if\r\nacquired by the males when adult, may have been transmitted at first to\r\nthe adults alone, and at some subsequent period transferred to the\r\nyoung. For it is known that when the law of inheritance at corresponding\r\nages fails, the offspring often inherit characters at an earlier age\r\nthan that at which they first appeared in their parents.[258] Cases\r\napparently of this kind have been observed with birds in a state of\r\nnature. For instance Mr. Blyth has seen specimens of _Lanius rufus_ and\r\nof _Colymbus glacialis_ which had assumed whilst young, in a quite\r\nanomalous manner, the adult plumage of their parents.[259] Again, the\r\nyoung of the common swan (_Cygnus olor_) do not cast off their dark\r\nfeathers and become white until eighteen months or two years old; but\r\nDr. F. Forel has described the case of three vigorous young birds, out\r\nof a brood of four, which were born pure white. These young birds were\r\nnot albinoes, as shewn by the colour of their beaks and legs, which\r\nnearly resembled the same parts in the adults.[260]\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to illustrate the above three modes by which, in\r\nthe present class, the two sexes and the young may have come to resemble\r\neach other, by the curious case of the genus Passer.[261] In the\r\nhouse-sparrow (_P. domesticus_) the male differs much from the female\r\nand from the young. These resemble each other, and likewise to a large\r\nextent both sexes and the young of the sparrow of Palestine (_P.\r\nbrachydactylus_), as well as of some allied species. We may therefore\r\nassume that the female and young of the house-sparrow approximately shew\r\nus the plumage of the progenitor of the genus. Now with the tree-sparrow\r\n(_P. montanus_) both sexes and the young closely resemble the male of\r\nthe house-sparrow; so that they have all been modified in the same\r\nmanner, and all depart from the typical colouring of their early\r\nprogenitor. This may have been effected by a male ancestor of the\r\ntree-sparrow having varied, firstly, when nearly mature, or, secondly,\r\nwhilst quite young, having in either case transmitted his modified\r\nplumage to the females and the young; or, thirdly, he may have varied\r\nwhen adult and transmitted his plumage to both adult sexes, and, owing\r\nto the failure of the law of inheritance at corresponding ages, at some\r\nsubsequent period to his young.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to decide which of these three modes has generally\r\nprevailed throughout the present class of cases. The belief that the\r\nmales varied whilst young, and transmitted their variations to their\r\noffspring of both sexes is perhaps the most probable. I may here add\r\nthat I have endeavoured, with little success, by consulting various\r\nworks, to decide how far with birds the period of variation has\r\ngenerally determined the transmission of characters to one sex or to\r\nboth. The two rules, often referred to (namely, that variations\r\noccurring late in life are transmitted to one and the same sex, whilst\r\nthose which occur early in life are transmitted to both sexes),\r\napparently hold good in the first,[262] second, and fourth classes of\r\ncases; but they fail in an equal number, namely, in the third, often in\r\nthe fifth,[263] and in the sixth small class. They hold good, however,\r\nas far as I can judge, with a considerable majority of the species of\r\nbirds. Whether or not this be so, we may conclude from the facts given\r\nin the eighth chapter that the period of variation has been one\r\nimportant element in determining the form of transmission.\r\n\r\nWith birds it is difficult to decide by what standard we ought to judge\r\nof the earliness or lateness of the period of variation, whether by the\r\nage in reference to the duration of life, or to the power of\r\nreproduction, or to the number of moults through which the species\r\npasses. The moulting of birds, even within the same family, sometimes\r\ndiffers much without any assignable cause. Some birds moult so early,\r\nthat nearly all the body-feathers are cast off before the first\r\nwing-feathers are fully grown; and we cannot believe that this was the\r\nprimordial state of things. When the period of moulting has been\r\naccelerated, the age at which the colours of the adult plumage were\r\nfirst developed would falsely appear to us to have been earlier than it\r\nreally was. This may be illustrated by the practice followed by some\r\nbird-fanciers, who pull out a few feathers from the breast of nestling\r\nbullfinches, and from the head or neck of young gold-pheasants, in order\r\nto ascertain their sex; for in the males these feathers are immediately\r\nreplaced by coloured ones.[264] The actual duration of life is known in\r\nbut few birds, so that we can hardly judge by this standard. And with\r\nreference to the period at which the powers of reproduction are gained,\r\nit is a remarkable fact that various birds occasionally breed whilst\r\nretaining their immature plumage.[265]\r\n\r\nThe fact of birds breeding in their immature plumage seems opposed to\r\nthe belief that sexual selection has played as important a part, as I\r\nbelieve it has, in giving ornamental colours, plumes, &c., to the males,\r\nand, by means of equal transmission, to the females of many species. The\r\nobjection would be a valid one, if the younger and less ornamented males\r\nwere as successful in winning females and propagating their kind, as the\r\nolder and more beautiful males. But we have no reason to suppose that\r\nthis is the case. Audubon speaks of the breeding of the immature males\r\nof _Ibis tantalus_ as a rare event, as does Mr. Swinhoe, in regard to\r\nthe immature males of Oriolus.[266] If the young of any species in their\r\nimmature plumage were more successful in winning partners than the\r\nadults, the adult plumage would probably soon be lost, as the males\r\nwhich retained their immature dress for the longest period would\r\nprevail, and thus the character of the species would ultimately be\r\nmodified.[267] If, on the other hand, the young never succeeded in\r\nobtaining a female, the habit of early reproduction would perhaps be\r\nsooner or later quite eliminated, from being superfluous and entailing\r\nwaste of power.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of certain birds goes on increasing in beauty during many\r\nyears after they are fully mature; this is the case with the train of\r\nthe peacock, and with the crest and plumes of certain herons; for\r\ninstance, the _Ardea Ludovicana_;[268] but it is very doubtful whether\r\nthe continued development of such feathers is the result of the\r\nselection of successive beneficial variations, or merely of continuous\r\ngrowth. Most fishes continue increasing in size, as long as they are in\r\ngood health and have plenty of food; and a somewhat similar law may\r\nprevail with the plumes of birds.\r\n\r\nCLASS V. _When the adults of both sexes have a distinct winter and\r\nsummer plumage, whether or not the male differs from the female, the\r\nyoung resemble the adults of both sexes in their winter dress, or much\r\nmore rarely in their summer dress, or they resemble the females alone;\r\nor the young may have an intermediate character; or again, they may\r\ndiffer greatly from the adults in both their seasonal plumages._—The\r\ncases in this class are singularly complex; nor is this surprising, as\r\nthey depend on inheritance, limited in a greater or less degree in three\r\ndifferent ways, namely by sex, age, and the season of the year. In some\r\ncases the individuals of the same species pass through at least five\r\ndistinct states of plumage. With the species, in which the male differs\r\nfrom the female during the summer season alone, or, which is rarer,\r\nduring both seasons,[269] the young generally resemble the females,—as\r\nwith the so-called goldfinch of North America, and apparently with the\r\nsplendid Maluri of Australia.[270] With the species, the sexes of which\r\nare alike during both the summer and winter, the young may resemble the\r\nadults, firstly, in their winter dress; secondly, which occurs much more\r\nrarely, in their summer dress; thirdly, they may be intermediate between\r\nthese two states; and, fourthly, they may differ greatly from the adults\r\nat all seasons. We have an instance of the first of these four cases in\r\none of the egrets of India (_Buphus coromandus_), in which the young and\r\nthe adults of both sexes are white during the winter, the adults\r\nbecoming golden-buff during the summer. With the Gaper (_Anastomus\r\noscitans_) of India we have a similar case, but the colours are\r\nreversed; for the young and the adults of both sexes are grey and black\r\nduring the winter, the adults becoming white during the summer.[271] As\r\nan instance of the second case, the young of the razor-bill (_Alca\r\ntorda_, Linn.), in an early state of plumage, are coloured like the\r\nadults during the summer; and the young of the white-crowned sparrow of\r\nNorth America (_Fringilla leucophrys_), as soon as fledged, have elegant\r\nwhite stripes on their heads, which are lost by the young and the old\r\nduring the winter.[272] With respect to the third case, namely, that of\r\nthe young having an intermediate character between the summer and winter\r\nadult plumages, Yarrell[273] insists that this occurs with many waders.\r\nLastly, in regard to the young differing greatly from both sexes in\r\ntheir adult summer and winter plumages, this occurs with some herons and\r\negrets of North America and India,—the young alone being white.\r\n\r\nI will make only a few remarks on these complicated cases. When the\r\nyoung resemble the female in her summer dress, or the adults of both\r\nsexes in their winter dress, the cases differ from those given under\r\nClasses I. and III. only in the characters originally acquired by the\r\nmales during the breeding-season, having been limited in their\r\ntransmission to the corresponding season. When the adults have a\r\ndistinct summer and winter plumage, and the young differ from both, the\r\ncase is more difficult to understand. We may admit as probable that the\r\nyoung have retained an ancient state of plumage; we can account through\r\nsexual selection for the summer or nuptial plumage of the adults, but\r\nhow are we to account for their distinct winter plumage? If we could\r\nadmit that this plumage serves in all cases as a protection, its\r\nacquirement would be a simple affair; but there seems no good reason for\r\nthis admission. It may be suggested that the widely different conditions\r\nof life during the winter and summer have acted in a direct manner on\r\nthe plumage; this may have had some effect, but I have not much\r\nconfidence in so great a difference, as we sometimes see, between the\r\ntwo plumages having been thus caused. A more probable explanation is,\r\nthat an ancient style of plumage, partially modified through the\r\ntransference of some characters from the summer plumage, has been\r\nretained by the adults during the winter. Finally, all the cases in our\r\npresent class apparently depend on characters acquired by the adult\r\nmales, having been variously limited in their transmission according to\r\nage, season, and sex; but it would not be worth while to attempt to\r\nfollow out these complex relations.\r\n\r\nCLASS VI. _The young in their first plumage differ from each other\r\naccording to sex; the young males resembling more or less closely the\r\nadult males, and the young females more or less closely the adult\r\nfemales._—The cases in the present class, though occurring in various\r\ngroups, are not numerous; yet, if experience had not taught us to the\r\ncontrary, it seems the most natural thing that the young should at first\r\nalways resemble to a certain extent, and gradually become more and more\r\nlike, the adults of the same sex. The adult male blackcap (_Sylvia\r\natricapilla_) has a black head, that of the female being reddish-brown;\r\nand I am informed by Mr. Blyth, that the young of both sexes can be\r\ndistinguished by this character even as nestlings. In the family of\r\nthrushes an unusual number of similar cases have been noticed; the male\r\nblackbird (_Turdus merula_) can be distinguished in the nest from the\r\nfemale, as the main wing-feathers, which are not moulted so soon as the\r\nbody-feathers, retain a brownish tint until the second general\r\nmoult.[274] The two sexes of the mocking bird (_Turdus polyglottus_,\r\nLinn.) differ very little from each other, yet the males can easily be\r\ndistinguished at a very early age from the females by shewing more pure\r\nwhite.[275] The males of a forest-thrush and of a rock-thrush (viz.\r\n_Orocetes erythrogastra_ and _Petrocincla cyanea_) have much of their\r\nplumage of a fine blue, whilst the females are brown; and the nestling\r\nmales of both species have their main wing and tail-feathers edged with\r\nblue, whilst those of the female are edged with brown.[276] So that the\r\nvery same feathers which in the young blackbird assume their mature\r\ncharacter and become black after the others, in these two species assume\r\nthis character and become blue before the others. The most probable view\r\nwith reference to these cases is that the males, differently from what\r\noccurs in Class I., have transmitted their colours to their male\r\noffspring at an earlier age than that at which they themselves first\r\nacquired them; for if they had varied whilst quite young, they would\r\nprobably have transmitted all their characters to their offspring of\r\nboth sexes.[277]\r\n\r\nIn _Aïthurus polytmus_ (one of the humming-birds) the male is splendidly\r\ncoloured black and green, and two of the tail-feathers are immensely\r\nlengthened; the female has an ordinary tail and inconspicuous colours;\r\nnow the young males, instead of resembling the adult female, in\r\naccordance with the common rule, begin from the first to assume the\r\ncolours proper to their sex, and their tail-feathers soon become\r\nelongated. I owe this information to Mr. Gould, who has given me the\r\nfollowing more striking and as yet unpublished case. Two humming-birds\r\nbelonging to the genus Eustephanus, both beautifully coloured, inhabit\r\nthe small island of Juan Fernandez, and have always been ranked as\r\nspecifically distinct. But it has lately been ascertained that the one,\r\nwhich is of a rich chesnut-brown colour with a golden-red head, is the\r\nmale, whilst the other, which is elegantly variegated with green and\r\nwhite with a metallic-green head, is the female. Now the young from the\r\nfirst resemble to a certain extent the adults of the corresponding sex,\r\nthe resemblance gradually becoming more and more complete.\r\n\r\nIn considering this last case, if as before we take the plumage of the\r\nyoung as our guide, it would appear that both sexes have been\r\nindependently rendered beautiful; and not that the one sex has partially\r\ntransferred its beauty to the other. The male apparently has acquired\r\nhis bright colours through sexual selection in the same manner as, for\r\ninstance, the peacock or pheasant in our first class of cases; and the\r\nfemale in the same manner as the female Rhynchæa or Turnix in our second\r\nclass of cases. But there is much difficulty in understanding how this\r\ncould have been effected at the same time with the two sexes of the same\r\nspecies. Mr. Salvin states, as we have seen in the eighth chapter, that\r\nwith certain humming-birds the males greatly exceed in number the\r\nfemales, whilst with other species inhabiting the same country the\r\nfemales greatly exceed the males. If, then, we might assume that during\r\nsome former lengthened period the males of the Juan Fernandez species\r\nhad greatly exceeded the females in number, but that during another\r\nlengthened period the females had greatly exceeded the males, we could\r\nunderstand how the males at one time, and the females at another time,\r\nmight have been rendered beautiful by the selection of the\r\nbrighter-coloured individuals of either sex; both sexes transmitting\r\ntheir characters to their young at a rather earlier age than usual.\r\nWhether this is the true explanation I will not pretend to say; but the\r\ncase is too remarkable to be passed over without notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now seen in numerous instances under all six classes, that an\r\nintimate relation exists between the plumage of the young and that of\r\nthe adults, either of one sex or both sexes. These relations are fairly\r\nwell explained on the principle that one sex—this being in the great\r\nmajority of cases the male—first acquired through variation and sexual\r\nselection bright colours or other ornaments, and transmitted them in\r\nvarious ways, in accordance with the recognised laws of inheritance. Why\r\nvariations have occurred at different periods of life, even sometimes\r\nwith the species of the same group, we do not know; but with respect to\r\nthe form of transmission, one important determining cause seems to have\r\nbeen the age at which the variations first appeared.\r\n\r\nFrom the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, and from any\r\nvariations in colour which occurred in the males at an early age not\r\nbeing then selected, on the contrary being often eliminated as\r\ndangerous, whilst similar variations occurring at or near the period of\r\nreproduction have been preserved, it follows that the plumage of the\r\nyoung will often have been left unmodified, or but little modified. We\r\nthus get some insight into the colouring of the progenitors of our\r\nexisting species. In a vast number of species in five out of our six\r\nclasses of cases, the adults of one sex or both are brightly coloured,\r\nat least during the breeding-season, whilst the young are invariably\r\nless brightly coloured than the adults, or are quite dull-coloured; for\r\nno instance is known, as far as I can discover, of the young of\r\ndull-coloured species displaying bright colours, or of the young of\r\nbrightly-coloured species being more brilliantly coloured than their\r\nparents. In the fourth class, however, in which the young and the old\r\nresemble each other, there are many species (though by no means all)\r\nbrightly-coloured, and as these form whole groups, we may infer that\r\ntheir early progenitors were likewise brightly-coloured. With this\r\nexception, if we look to the birds of the world, it appears that their\r\nbeauty has been greatly increased since that period, of which we have a\r\npartial record in their immature plumage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Colour of the Plumage in relation to Protection._—It will have\r\nbeen seen that I cannot follow Mr. Wallace in the belief that dull\r\ncolours when confined to the females have been in most cases specially\r\ngained for the sake of protection. There can, however, be no doubt, as\r\nformerly remarked, that both sexes of many birds have had their colours\r\nmodified for this purpose, so as to escape the notice of their enemies;\r\nor, in some instances, so as to approach their prey unobserved, in the\r\nsame manner as owls have had their plumage rendered soft, that their\r\nflight may not be overheard. Mr. Wallace remarks[278] that “it is only\r\nin the tropics, among forests which never lose their foliage, that we\r\nfind whole groups of birds, whose chief colour is green.” It will be\r\nadmitted by every one, who has ever tried, how difficult it is to\r\ndistinguish parrots in a leaf-covered tree. Nevertheless, we must\r\nremember that many parrots are ornamented with crimson, blue, and orange\r\ntints, which can hardly be protective. Woodpeckers are eminently\r\narboreal, but, besides green species, there are many black, and\r\nblack-and-white kinds—all the species being apparently exposed\r\nto nearly the same dangers. It is therefore probable that\r\nstrongly-pronounced colours have been acquired by tree-haunting birds\r\nthrough sexual selection, but that green tints have had an advantage\r\nthrough natural selection over other colours for the sake of protection.\r\n\r\nIn regard to birds which live on the ground, everyone admits that they\r\nare coloured so as to imitate the surrounding surface. How difficult it\r\nis to see a partridge, snipe, woodcock, certain plovers, larks, and\r\nnightjars when crouched on the ground. Animals inhabiting deserts offer\r\nthe most striking instances, for the bare surface affords no\r\nconcealment, and all the smaller quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds depend\r\nfor safety on their colours. As Mr. Tristram has remarked,[279] in\r\nregard to the inhabitants of the Sahara, all are protected by their\r\n“isabelline or sand-colour.” Calling to my recollection the desert-birds\r\nwhich I had seen in South America, as well as most of the ground-birds\r\nin Great Britain, it appeared to me that both sexes in such cases are\r\ngenerally coloured nearly alike. Accordingly I applied to Mr. Tristram,\r\nwith respect to the birds of the Sahara, and he has kindly given me the\r\nfollowing information. There are twenty-six species, belonging to\r\nfifteen genera, which manifestly have had their plumage coloured in a\r\nprotective manner; and this colouring is all the more striking, as with\r\nmost of these birds it is different from that of their congeners. Both\r\nsexes of thirteen out of the twenty-six species are coloured in the same\r\nmanner; but these belong to genera in which this rule commonly prevails,\r\nso that they tell us nothing about the protective colours being the same\r\nin both sexes of desert-birds. Of the other thirteen species, three\r\nbelong to genera in which the sexes usually differ from each other, yet\r\nthey have the sexes alike. In the remaining ten species, the male\r\ndiffers from the female; but the difference is confined chiefly to the\r\nunder surface of the plumage, which is concealed when the bird crouches\r\non the ground; the head and back being of the same sand-coloured hue in\r\nboth sexes. So that in these ten species the upper surfaces of both\r\nsexes have been acted on and rendered alike, through natural selection,\r\nfor the sake of protection; whilst the lower surfaces of the males alone\r\nhave been diversified through sexual selection, for the sake of\r\nornament. Here, as both sexes are equally well protected, we clearly see\r\nthat the females have not been prevented through natural selection from\r\ninheriting the colours of their male parents: we must look to the law of\r\nsexually limited transmission, as before explained.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the world both sexes of many soft-billed birds,\r\nespecially those which frequent reeds or sedges, are obscurely coloured.\r\nNo doubt if their colours had been brilliant, they would have been much\r\nmore conspicuous to their enemies; but whether their dull tints have\r\nbeen specially gained for the sake of protection seems, as far as I can\r\njudge, rather doubtful. It is still more doubtful whether such dull\r\ntints can have been gained for the sake of ornament. We must, however,\r\nbear in mind that male birds, though dull-coloured, often differ much\r\nfrom their females, as with the common sparrow, and this leads to the\r\nbelief that such colours have been gained through sexual selection, from\r\nbeing attractive. Many of the soft-billed birds are songsters; and a\r\ndiscussion in a former chapter should not be forgotten, in which it was\r\nshewn that the best songsters are rarely ornamented with bright tints.\r\nIt would appear that female birds, as a general rule, have selected\r\ntheir mates either for their sweet voices or gay colours, but not for\r\nboth charms combined. Some species which are manifestly coloured for the\r\nsake of protection, such as the jack-snipe, woodcock, and nightjar, are\r\nlikewise marked and shaded, according to our standard of taste, with\r\nextreme elegance. In such cases we may conclude that both natural and\r\nsexual selection have acted conjointly for protection and ornament.\r\nWhether any bird exists which does not possess some special attraction,\r\nby which to charm the opposite sex, may be doubted. When both sexes are\r\nso obscurely coloured, that it would be rash to assume the agency of\r\nsexual selection, and when no direct evidence can be advanced shewing\r\nthat such colours serve as a protection, it is best to own complete\r\nignorance of the cause, or, which comes to nearly the same thing, to\r\nattribute the result to the direct action of the conditions of life.\r\n\r\nThere are many birds both sexes of which are conspicuously, though not\r\nbrilliantly coloured, such as the numerous black, white, or piebald\r\nspecies; and these colours, are probably the result of sexual selection.\r\nWith the common blackbird, capercailzie, black-cock, black Scoter-duck\r\n(Oidemia), and even with one of the Birds of Paradise (_Lophorina\r\natra_), the males alone are black, whilst the females are brown or\r\nmottled; and there can hardly be a doubt that blackness in these cases\r\nhas been a sexually selected character. Therefore it is in some degree\r\nprobable that the complete or partial blackness of both sexes in such\r\nbirds as crows, certain cockatoos, storks, and swans, and many marine\r\nbirds, is likewise the result of sexual selection, accompanied by equal\r\ntransmission to both sexes; for blackness can hardly serve in any case\r\nas a protection. With several birds, in which the male alone is black,\r\nand in others in which both sexes are black, the beak or skin about the\r\nhead is brightly coloured, and the contrast thus afforded adds greatly\r\nto their beauty; we see this in the bright yellow beak of the male\r\nblackbird, in the crimson skin over the eyes of the black-cock and\r\ncapercailzie, in the variously and brightly-coloured beak of the\r\nScoter-drake (Oidemia), in the red beak of the chough (_Corvus\r\ngraculus_, Linn.), of the black swan, and black stork. This leads me to\r\nremark that it is not at all incredible that toucans may owe the\r\nenormous size of their beaks to sexual selection, for the sake of\r\ndisplaying the diversified and vivid stripes of colour, with which these\r\norgans are ornamented.[280] The naked skin at the base of the beak and\r\nround the eyes is likewise often brilliantly coloured; and Mr. Gould, in\r\nspeaking of one species,[281] says that the colours of the beak “are\r\ndoubtless in the finest and most brilliant state during the time of\r\npairing.” There is no greater improbability in toucans being encumbered\r\nwith immense beaks, though rendered as light as possible by their\r\ncancellated structure, for an object falsely appearing to us\r\nunimportant, namely, the display of fine colours, than that the male\r\nArgus pheasant and some other birds should be encumbered with plumes so\r\nlong as to impede their flight.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, as the males alone of various species are black, the\r\nfemales being dull-coloured; so in a few cases the males alone are\r\neither wholly or partially white, as with the several Bell-birds of\r\nSouth America (Chasmorhynchus), the Antarctic goose (_Bernicla\r\nantarctica_), the silver pheasant, &c., whilst the females are brown or\r\nobscurely mottled. Therefore, on the same principle as before, it is\r\nprobable that both sexes of many birds, such as white cockatoos, several\r\negrets with their beautiful plumes, certain ibises, gulls, terns, &c.,\r\nhave acquired their more or less completely white plumage through sexual\r\nselection. The species which inhabit snowy regions of course come under\r\na different head. The white plumage of some of the above-named birds\r\nappears in both sexes only when they are mature. This is likewise the\r\ncase with certain gannets, tropic-birds, &c., and with the snow-goose\r\n(_Anser hyperboreus_). As the latter breeds on the “barren grounds,”\r\nwhen not covered with snow, and as it migrates southward during the\r\nwinter, there is no reason to suppose that its snow-white adult plumage\r\nserves as a protection. In the case of the _Anastomus oscitans_\r\npreviously alluded to, we have still better evidence that the white\r\nplumage is a nuptial character, for it is developed only during the\r\nsummer; the young in their immature state, and the adults in their\r\nwinter dress, being grey and black. With many kinds of gulls (Larus),\r\nthe head and neck become pure white during the summer, being grey or\r\nmottled during the winter and in the young state. On the other hand,\r\nwith the smaller gulls, or sea-mews (Gavia), and with some terns\r\n(Sterna), exactly the reverse occurs; for the heads of the young birds\r\nduring the first year, and of the adults during the winter, are either\r\npure white, or much paler-coloured than during the breeding-season.\r\nThese latter cases offer another instance of the capricious manner in\r\nwhich sexual selection appears often to have acted.[282]\r\n\r\nThe cause of aquatic birds having acquired a white plumage so much more\r\nfrequently than terrestrial birds, probably depends on their large size\r\nand strong powers of flight, so that they can easily defend themselves\r\nor escape from birds of prey, to which moreover they are not much\r\nexposed. Consequently sexual selection has not here been interfered with\r\nor guided for the sake of protection. No doubt, with birds which roam\r\nover the open ocean, the males and females could find each other much\r\nmore easily when made conspicuous either by being perfectly white, or\r\nintensely black; so that these colours may possibly serve the same end\r\nas the call-notes of many land-birds. A white or black bird, when it\r\ndiscovers and flies down to a carcase floating on the sea or cast up on\r\nthe beach, will be seen from a great distance, and will guide other\r\nbirds of the same and of distinct species, to the prey; but as this\r\nwould be a disadvantage to the first finders, the individuals which were\r\nthe whitest or blackest would not thus have procured more food than the\r\nless strongly coloured individuals. Hence conspicuous colours cannot\r\nhave been gradually acquired for this purpose through natural\r\nselection.[283]\r\n\r\nAs sexual selection depends on so fluctuating an element as taste, we\r\ncan understand how it is that within the same group of birds, with\r\nhabits of life nearly the same, there should exist white or nearly\r\nwhite, as well as black, or nearly black species,—for instance, white\r\nand black cockatoos, storks, ibises, swans, terns, and petrels. Piebald\r\nbirds likewise sometimes occur in the same groups, for instance, the\r\nblack-necked swan, certain terns, and the common magpie. That a strong\r\ncontrast in colour is agreeable to birds, we may conclude, by looking\r\nthrough any large collection of specimens or series of coloured plates,\r\nfor the sexes frequently differ from each other in the male having the\r\npale parts of a purer white, and the variously coloured dark parts of\r\nstill darker tints than in the female.\r\n\r\nIt would even appear that mere novelty, or change for the sake of\r\nchange, has sometimes acted like a charm on female birds, in the same\r\nmanner as changes of fashion with us. The Duke of Argyll says,[284]—and\r\nI am glad to have the unusual satisfaction of following for even a short\r\ndistance in his footsteps—“I am more and more convinced that variety,\r\nmere variety, must be admitted to be an object and an aim in Nature.” I\r\nwish the Duke had explained what he here means by Nature. Is it meant\r\nthat the Creator of the universe ordained diversified results for His\r\nown satisfaction, or for that of man? The former notion seems to me as\r\nmuch wanting in due reverence as the latter in probability.\r\nCapriciousness of taste in the birds themselves appears a more fitting\r\nexplanation. For example; the males of some parrots can hardly be said\r\nto be more beautiful, at least according to our taste, than the females,\r\nbut they differ from them in such points, as the male having a\r\nrose-coloured collar instead of, as in the female, “a bright emeraldine\r\nnarrow green collar;” or in the male having a black collar instead of “a\r\nyellow demi-collar in front,” with a pale roseate instead of a plum-blue\r\nhead.[285] As so many male birds have for their chief ornament elongated\r\ntail-feathers or elongated crests, the shortened tail, formerly\r\ndescribed in the male of a humming-bird, and the shortened crest of the\r\nmale goosander almost seem like one of the many opposite changes of\r\nfashion which we admire in our own dresses.\r\n\r\nSome members of the heron family offer a still more curious case of\r\nnovelty in colouring having apparently been appreciated for the sake of\r\nnovelty. The young of the _Ardea asha_ are white, the adults being dark\r\nslate-coloured; and not only the young, but the adults of the allied\r\n_Buphus coromandus_ in their winter plumage are white, this colour\r\nchanging into a rich golden-buff during the breeding-season. It is\r\nincredible that the young of these two species, as well as of some other\r\nmembers of the same family,[286] should have been specially rendered\r\npure white and thus made conspicuous to their enemies; or that the\r\nadults of one of these two species should have been specially rendered\r\nwhite during the winter in a country which is never covered with snow.\r\nOn the other hand we have reason to believe that whiteness has been\r\ngained by many birds as a sexual ornament. We may therefore conclude\r\nthat an early progenitor of the _Ardea asha_ and the _Buphus_ acquired a\r\nwhite plumage for nuptial purposes, and transmitted this colour to their\r\nyoung; so that the young and the old became white like certain existing\r\negrets; the whiteness having afterwards been retained by the young\r\nwhilst exchanged by the adults for more strongly pronounced tints. But\r\nif we could look still further backwards in time to the still earlier\r\nprogenitors of these two species, we should probably see the adults\r\ndark-coloured. I infer that this would be the case, from the analogy of\r\nmany other birds, which are dark whilst young, and when adult are white;\r\nand more especially from the case of the _Ardea gularis_, the colours of\r\nwhich are the reverse of those of _A. asha_, for the young are\r\ndark-coloured and the adults white, the young having retained a former\r\nstate of plumage. It appears therefore that the progenitors in their\r\nadult condition of the _Ardea asha_, the _Buphus_, and of some allies,\r\nhave undergone, during a long line of descent, the following changes of\r\ncolour: firstly a dark shade, secondly pure white, and thirdly, owing to\r\nanother change of fashion (if I may so express myself), their present\r\nslaty, reddish, or golden-buff tints. These successive changes are\r\nintelligible only on the principle of novelty having been admired by\r\nbirds for the sake of novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Four Chapters on Birds._—Most male birds are highly\r\npugnacious during the breeding-season, and some possess weapons\r\nespecially adapted for fighting with their rivals. But the most\r\npugnacious and the best-armed males rarely or never depend for success\r\nsolely on their power to drive away or kill their rivals, but have\r\nspecial means for charming the female. With some it is the power of\r\nsong, or of emitting strange cries, or of producing instrumental music,\r\nand the males in consequence differ from the females in their vocal\r\norgans, or in the structure of certain feathers. From the curiously\r\ndiversified means for producing various sounds we gain a high idea of\r\nthe importance of this means of courtship. Many birds endeavour to charm\r\nthe females by love-dances or antics, performed on the ground or in the\r\nair, and sometimes at prepared places. But ornaments of many kinds, the\r\nmost brilliant tints, combs and wattles, beautiful plumes, elongated\r\nfeathers, top-knots, and so forth, are by far the commonest means. In\r\nsome cases mere novelty appears to have acted as a charm. The ornaments\r\nof the males must be highly important to them, for they have been\r\nacquired in not a few cases at the cost of increased danger from\r\nenemies, and even at some loss of power in fighting with their rivals.\r\nThe males of very many species do not assume their ornamental dress\r\nuntil they arrive at maturity, or they assume it only during the\r\nbreeding-season, or the tints then become more vivid. Certain ornamental\r\nappendages become enlarged, turgid, and brightly-coloured during the\r\nvery act of courtship. The males display their charms with elaborate\r\ncare and to the best effect; and this is done in the presence of the\r\nfemales. The courtship is sometimes a prolonged affair, and many males\r\nand females congregate at an appointed place. To suppose that the\r\nfemales do not appreciate the beauty of the males is to admit that their\r\nsplendid decorations, all their pomp and display, are useless; and this\r\nis incredible. Birds have fine powers of discrimination, and in some few\r\ninstances it can be shewn that they have a taste for the beautiful. The\r\nfemales, moreover, are known occasionally to exhibit a marked\r\npreference or antipathy for certain individual males.\r\n\r\nIf it be admitted that the females prefer, or are unconsciously excited\r\nby the more beautiful males, then the males would slowly but surely be\r\nrendered more and more attractive through sexual selection. That it is\r\nthis sex which has been chiefly modified we may infer from the fact that\r\nin almost every genus in which the sexes differ, the males differ much\r\nmore from each other than do the females; this is well shewn in certain\r\nclosely-allied representative species in which the females can hardly be\r\ndistinguished, whilst the males are quite distinct. Birds in a state of\r\nnature offer individual differences which would amply suffice for the\r\nwork of sexual selection; but we have seen that they occasionally\r\npresent more strongly-marked variations which recur so frequently that\r\nthey would immediately be fixed, if they served to allure the female.\r\nThe laws of variation will have determined the nature of the initial\r\nchanges, and largely influenced the final result. The gradations, which\r\nmay be observed between the males of allied species, indicate the nature\r\nof the steps which have been passed through, and explain in the most\r\ninteresting manner certain characters, such as the indented ocelli of\r\nthe tail-feathers of the peacock, and the wonderfully-shaded ocelli of\r\nthe wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant. It is evident that the\r\nbrilliant colours, top-knots, fine plumes, &c., of many male birds\r\ncannot have been acquired as a protection; indeed they sometimes lead to\r\ndanger. That they are not due to the direct and definite action of the\r\nconditions of life, we may feel assured, because the females have been\r\nexposed to the same conditions, and yet often differ from the males to\r\nan extreme degree. Although it is probable that changed conditions\r\nacting during a lengthened period have produced some definite effect on\r\nboth sexes, the more important result will have been an increased\r\ntendency to fluctuating variability or to augmented individual\r\ndifferences; and such differences will have afforded an excellent\r\ngroundwork for the action of sexual selection.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance, irrespectively of selection, appear to have\r\ndetermined whether the characters acquired by the males for the sake of\r\nornament, for producing various sounds, and for fighting together, have\r\nbeen transmitted to the males alone or to both sexes, either permanently\r\nor periodically during certain seasons of the year. Why various\r\ncharacters should sometimes have been transmitted in one way and\r\nsometimes in another is, in most cases, not known; but the period of\r\nvariability seems often to have been the determining cause. When the two\r\nsexes have inherited all characters in common they necessarily resemble\r\neach other; but as the successive variations may be differently\r\ntransmitted, every possible gradation may be found, even within the same\r\ngenus, from the closest similarity to the widest dissimilarity between\r\nthe sexes. With many closely-allied species, following nearly the same\r\nhabits of life, the males have come to differ from each other chiefly\r\nthrough the action of sexual selection; whilst the females have come to\r\ndiffer chiefly from partaking in a greater or lesser degree of the\r\ncharacters thus acquired by the males. The effects, moreover, of the\r\ndefinite action of the conditions of life, will not have been masked in\r\nthe females, as in the case of the males, by the accumulation through\r\nsexual selection of strongly-pronounced colours and other ornaments. The\r\nindividuals of both sexes, however affected, will have been kept at each\r\nsuccessive period nearly uniform by the free intercrossing of many\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nWith the species, in which the sexes differ in colour, it is possible\r\nthat at first there existed a tendency to transmit the successive\r\nvariations equally to both sexes; and that the females were prevented\r\nfrom acquiring the bright colours of the males, on account of the danger\r\nto which they would have been exposed during incubation. But it would\r\nbe, as far as I can see, an extremely difficult process to convert, by\r\nmeans of natural selection, one form of transmission into another. On\r\nthe other hand there would not be the least difficulty in rendering a\r\nfemale dull-coloured, the male being still kept bright-coloured, by the\r\nselection of successive variations, which were from the first limited in\r\ntheir transmission to the same sex. Whether the females of many species\r\nhave actually been thus modified, must at present remain doubtful. When,\r\nthrough the law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes,\r\nthe females have been rendered as conspicuously coloured as the males,\r\ntheir instincts have often been modified, and they have been led to\r\nbuild domed or concealed nests.\r\n\r\nIn one small and curious class of cases the characters and habits of the\r\ntwo sexes have been completely transposed, for the females are larger,\r\nstronger, more vociferous and brightly-coloured than their males. They\r\nhave, also, become so quarrelsome that they often fight together like\r\nthe males of the most pugnacious species. If, as seems probable, they\r\nhabitually drive away rival females, and by the display of their bright\r\ncolours or other charms endeavour to attract the males, we can\r\nunderstand how it is that they have gradually been rendered, by means of\r\nsexual selection and sexually-limited transmission, more beautiful than\r\nthe males—the latter being left unmodified or only slightly modified.\r\n\r\nWhenever the law of inheritance at corresponding ages prevails, but not\r\nthat of sexually-limited transmission, then if the parents vary late in\r\nlife—and we know that this constantly occurs with our poultry, and\r\noccasionally with other birds—the young will be left unaffected, whilst\r\nthe adults of both sexes will be modified. If both these laws of\r\ninheritance prevail and either sex varies late in life, that sex alone\r\nwill be modified, the other sex and the young being left unaffected.\r\nWhen variations in brightness or in other conspicuous characters occur\r\nearly in life, as no doubt often happens, they will not be acted on\r\nthrough sexual selection until the period of reproduction arrives;\r\nconsequently they will be liable to be lost by the accidental deaths of\r\nthe young, and if dangerous will be eliminated through natural\r\nselection. Thus we can understand how it is that variations arising late\r\nin life have chiefly been preserved for the ornamentation and arming of\r\nthe males, the females and the young being left almost unaffected, and\r\ntherefore like each other. With species having a distinct summer and\r\nwinter plumage, the males of which either resemble or differ from the\r\nfemales during both seasons or during the summer alone, the degrees and\r\nkinds of resemblance between the young and the old are exceedingly\r\ncomplex; and this complexity apparently depends on characters, first\r\nacquired by the males, being transmitted in various ways and degrees, as\r\nlimited by age, sex, and season.\r\n\r\nAs the young of so many species have been but little modified in colour\r\nand in other ornaments, we are enabled to form some judgment with\r\nrespect to the plumage of their early progenitors; and we may infer that\r\nthe beauty of our existing species, if we look to the whole class, has\r\nbeen largely increased since that period of which the immature plumage\r\ngives us an indirect record. Many birds, especially those which live\r\nmuch on the ground, have undoubtedly been obscurely coloured for the\r\nsake of protection. In some instances the upper exposed surface of the\r\nplumage has been thus coloured in both sexes, whilst the lower surface\r\nin the males alone has been variously ornamented through sexual\r\nselection. Finally, from the facts given in these four chapters, we may\r\nconclude that weapons for battle, organs for producing sound, ornaments\r\nof many kinds, bright and conspicuous colours, have generally been\r\nacquired by the males through variation and sexual selection, and have\r\nbeen transmitted in various ways according to the several laws of\r\ninheritance—the females and the young being left comparatively but\r\nlittle modified.[287]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAMMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The law of battle—Special weapons, confined to the\r\n   males—Cause of absence of weapons in the female—Weapons\r\n   common to both sexes, yet primarily acquired by the\r\n   male—Other uses of such weapons—Their high\r\n   importance—Greater size of the male—Means of defence—On the\r\n   preference shewn by either sex in the pairing of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith mammals the male appears to win the female much more through the\r\nlaw of battle than through the display of his charms. The most timid\r\nanimals, not provided with any special weapons for fighting, engage in\r\ndesperate conflicts during the season of love. Two male hares have been\r\nseen to fight together until one was killed; male moles often fight, and\r\nsometimes with fatal results; male squirrels “engage in frequent\r\ncontests, and often wound each other severely;” as do male beavers, so\r\nthat “hardly a skin is without scars.”[288] I observed the same fact\r\nwith the hides of the guanacoes in Patagonia; and on one occasion\r\nseveral were so absorbed in fighting that they fearlessly rushed close\r\nby me. Livingstone speaks of the males of the many animals in Southern\r\nAfrica as almost invariably shewing the scars received in former\r\ncontests.\r\n\r\nThe law of battle prevails with aquatic as with terrestrial mammals. It\r\nis notorious how desperately male seals fight, both with their teeth and\r\nclaws, during the breeding-season; and their hides are likewise often\r\ncovered with scars. Male sperm-whales are very jealous at this season;\r\nand in their battles “they often lock their jaws together, and turn on\r\ntheir sides and twist about;” so that it is believed by some naturalists\r\nthat the frequently deformed state of their lower jaws is caused by\r\nthese struggles.[289]\r\n\r\nAll male animals which are furnished with special weapons for fighting,\r\nare well known to engage in fierce battles. The courage and the\r\ndesperate conflicts of stags have often been described; their skeletons\r\nhave been found in various parts of the world, with the horns\r\ninextricably locked together, shewing how miserably the victor and\r\nvanquished had perished.[290] No animal in the world is so dangerous as\r\nan elephant in must. Lord Tankerville has given me a graphic description\r\nof the battles between the wild bulls in Chillingham Park, the\r\ndescendants, degenerated in size but not in courage, of the gigantic\r\n_Bos primigenius_. In 1861 several contended for mastery; and it was\r\nobserved that two of the younger bulls attacked in concert the old\r\nleader of the herd, overthrew and disabled him, so that he was believed\r\nby the keepers to be lying mortally wounded in a neighbouring wood. But\r\na few days afterwards one of the young bulls singly approached the wood;\r\nand then the “monarch of the chase,” who had been lashing himself up\r\nfor vengeance, came out and, in a short time killed his antagonist. He\r\nthen quietly joined the herd, and long held undisputed sway. Admiral Sir\r\nB. J. Sulivan informs me that when he resided in the Falkland Islands he\r\nimported a young English stallion, which, with eight mares, frequented\r\nthe hills near Port William. On these hills there were two wild\r\nstallions, each with a small troop of mares; “and it is certain that\r\nthese stallions would never have approached each other without fighting.\r\nBoth had tried singly to fight the English horse and drive away his\r\nmares, but had failed. One day they came in _together_ and attacked him.\r\nThis was seen by the capitan who had charge of the horses, and who, on\r\nriding to the spot, found one of the two stallions engaged with the\r\nEnglish horse, whilst the other was driving away the mares, and had\r\nalready separated four from the rest. The capitan settled the matter by\r\ndriving the whole party into the corral, for the wild stallions would\r\nnot leave the mares.”\r\n\r\nMale animals already provided with efficient cutting or tearing teeth\r\nfor the ordinary purposes of life, as in the carnivora, insectivora, and\r\nrodents, are seldom furnished with weapons especially adapted for\r\nfighting with their rivals. The case is very different with the males of\r\nmany other animals. We see this in the horns of stags and of certain\r\nkinds of antelopes in which the females are hornless. With many animals\r\nthe canine teeth in the upper or lower jaw, or in both, are much larger\r\nin the males than in the females; or are absent in the latter, with the\r\nexception sometimes of a hidden rudiment. Certain antelopes, the\r\nmusk-deer, camel, horse, boar, various apes, seals, and the walrus,\r\noffer instances of these several cases. In the females of the walrus\r\nthe tusks are sometimes quite absent.[291] In the male elephant of India\r\nand in the male dugong[292] the upper incisors form offensive weapons.\r\nIn the male narwhal one alone of the upper teeth is developed into the\r\nwell-known, spirally-twisted, so called horn, which is sometimes from\r\nnine to ten feet in length. It is believed that the males use these\r\nhorns for fighting together; for “an unbroken one can rarely be got, and\r\noccasionally one may be found with the point of another jammed into the\r\nbroken place.”[293] The tooth on the opposite side of the head in the\r\nmale consists of a rudiment about ten inches in length, which is\r\nembedded in the jaw. It is not, however, very uncommon to find\r\ndouble-horned male narwhals in which both teeth are well developed. In\r\nthe females both teeth are rudimentary. The male cachalot has a larger\r\nhead than that of the female, and it no doubt aids these animals in\r\ntheir aquatic battles. Lastly, the adult male ornithorhynchus is\r\nprovided with a remarkable apparatus, namely a spur on the fore-leg,\r\nclosely resembling the poison-fang of a venomous snake; its use is not\r\nknown, but we may suspect that it serves as a weapon of offence.[294] It\r\nis represented by a mere rudiment in the female.\r\n\r\nWhen the males are provided with weapons which the females do not\r\npossess, there can hardly be a doubt that they are used for fighting\r\nwith other males, and that they have been acquired through sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable, at least in most cases, that the females have\r\nactually been saved from acquiring such weapons, owing to their being\r\nuseless and superfluous, or in some way injurious. On the contrary, as\r\nthey are often used by the males of many animals for various purposes,\r\nmore especially as a defence against their enemies, it is a surprising\r\nfact that they are so poorly developed or quite absent in the females.\r\nNo doubt with female deer the development during each recurrent season\r\nof great branching horns, and with female elephants the development of\r\nimmense tusks, would have been a great waste of vital power, on the\r\nadmission that they were of no use to the females. Consequently\r\nvariations in the size of these organs, leading to their suppression,\r\nwould have come under the control of natural selection, and if limited\r\nin their transmission to the female offspring would not have interfered\r\nwith their development through sexual selection in the males. But how on\r\nthis view can we explain the presence of horns in the females of certain\r\nantelopes, and of tusks in the females of many animals, which are only\r\nof slightly less size than in the males? The explanation in almost all\r\ncases must, I believe, be sought in the laws of transmission.\r\n\r\nAs the reindeer is the single species in the whole family of Deer in\r\nwhich the female is furnished with horns, though somewhat smaller,\r\nthinner, and less branched than in the male, it might naturally be\r\nthought that they must be of some special use to her. There is, however,\r\nsome evidence opposed to this view. The female retains her horns from\r\nthe time when they are fully developed, namely in September, throughout\r\nthe winter, until May, when she brings forth her young; whilst the male\r\ncasts his horns much earlier, towards the end of November. As both sexes\r\nhave the same requirements and follow the same habits of life, and as\r\nthe male sheds his horns during the winter, it is very improbable that\r\nthey can be of any special service to the female at this season, which\r\nincludes the larger proportion of the time during which she bears horns.\r\nNor is it probable that she can have inherited horns from some ancient\r\nprogenitor of the whole family of deer, for, from the fact of the males\r\nalone of so many species in all quarters of the globe possessing horns,\r\nwe may conclude that this was the primordial character of the group.\r\nHence it appears that horns must have been transferred from the male to\r\nthe female at a period subsequent to the divergence of the various\r\nspecies from a common stock; but that this was not effected for the sake\r\nof giving her any special advantage.[295]\r\n\r\nWe know that the horns are developed at a most unusually early age in\r\nthe reindeer; but what the cause of this may have been is not known. The\r\neffect, however, has apparently been the transference of the horns to\r\nboth sexes. It is intelligible on the hypothesis of pangenesis, that a\r\nvery slight change in the constitution of the male, either in the\r\ntissues of the forehead or in the gemmules of the horns, might lead to\r\ntheir early development; and as the young of both sexes have nearly the\r\nsame constitution before the period of reproduction, the horns, if\r\ndeveloped at an early age in the male, would tend to be developed\r\nequally in both sexes. In support of this view, we should bear in mind\r\nthat the horns are always transmitted through the female, and that she\r\nhas a latent capacity for their development, as we see in old or\r\ndiseased females.[296] Moreover the females of some other species of\r\ndeer either normally or occasionally exhibit rudiments of horns; thus\r\nthe female of _Cervulus moschatus_ has “bristly tufts, ending in a knob,\r\ninstead of a horn;” and “in most specimens of the female Wapiti (_Cervus\r\nCanadensis_) there is a sharp bony protuberance in the place of the\r\nhorn.”[297] From these several considerations we may conclude that the\r\npossession of fairly well-developed horns by the female reindeer, is due\r\nto the males having first acquired them as weapons for fighting with\r\nother males; and secondarily to their development from some unknown\r\ncause at an unusually early age in the males, and their consequent\r\ntransmission to both sexes.\r\n\r\nTurning to the sheath-horned ruminants: with antelopes a graduated\r\nseries can be formed, beginning with the species, the females of which\r\nare completely destitute of horns—passing to those which have horns so\r\nsmall as to be almost rudimentary, as in _Antilocapra Americana_—to\r\nthose which have fairly well-developed horns, but manifestly smaller and\r\nthinner than in the male, and sometimes of a different shape,[298] and\r\nending with those in which both sexes have horns of equal size. As with\r\nthe reindeer, so with antelopes there exists a relation between the\r\nperiod of the development of the horns and their transmission to one or\r\nboth sexes; it is therefore probable that their presence or absence in\r\nthe females of some species, and their more or less perfect condition in\r\nthe females of other species, depend, not on their being of some special\r\nuse, but simply on the form of inheritance which has prevailed. It\r\naccords with this view that even in the same restricted genus both sexes\r\nof some species, and the males alone of other species, are thus\r\nprovided. It is a remarkable fact that, although the females of\r\n_Antilope bezoartica_ are normally destitute of horns, Mr. Blyth has\r\nseen no less than three females thus furnished; and there was no reason\r\nto suppose that they were old or diseased. The males of this species\r\nhave long straight spirated horns, nearly parallel to each other, and\r\ndirected backwards. Those of the female, when present, are very\r\ndifferent in shape, for they are not spirated, and spreading widely bend\r\nround, so that their points are directed forwards. It is a still more\r\nremarkable fact that in the castrated male, as Mr. Blyth informs me, the\r\nhorns are of the same peculiar shape as in the female, but longer and\r\nthicker. In all cases the differences between the horns of the males and\r\nfemales, and of castrated and entire males, probably depend on various\r\ncauses,—on the more or less complete transference of male characters to\r\nthe females,—on the former state of the progenitors of the\r\nspecies,—and partly perhaps on the horns being differently nourished,\r\nin nearly the same manner as the spurs of the domestic cock, when\r\ninserted into the comb or other parts of the body, assume various\r\nabnormal forms from being differently nourished.\r\n\r\nIn all the wild species of goats and sheep the horns are larger in the\r\nmale than in the female, and are sometimes quite absent in the\r\nlatter.[299] In several domestic breeds of the sheep and goat, the\r\nmales alone are furnished with horns; and it is a significant fact, that\r\nin one such breed of sheep on the Guinea coast, the horns are not\r\ndeveloped, as Mr. Winwood Reade informs me, in the castrated male; so\r\nthat they are affected in this respect like the horns of stags. In some\r\nbreeds, as in that of N. Wales, in which both sexes are properly horned,\r\nthe ewes are very liable to be hornless. In these same sheep, as I have\r\nbeen informed by a trustworthy witness who purposely inspected a flock\r\nduring the lambing-season, the horns at birth are generally more fully\r\ndeveloped in the male than in the female. With the adult musk-ox\r\n(_Ovibos moschatus_) the horns of the male are larger than those of the\r\nfemale, and in the latter the bases do not touch.[300] In regard to\r\nordinary cattle Mr. Blyth remarks: “In most of the wild bovine animals\r\nthe horns are both longer and thicker in the bull than in the cow, and\r\nin the cow-banteng (_Bos sondaicus_) the horns are remarkably small, and\r\ninclined much backwards. In the domestic races of cattle, both of the\r\nhumped and humpless types, the horns are short and thick in the bull,\r\nlonger and more slender in the cow and ox; and in the Indian buffalo,\r\nthey are shorter and thicker in the bull, longer and more slender in the\r\ncow. In the wild gaour (_B. gaurus_) the horns are mostly both longer\r\nand thicker in the bull than in the cow.”[301] Hence with most\r\nsheath-horned ruminants the horns of the male are either longer or\r\nstronger than those of the female. With the _Rhinoceros simus_, as I may\r\nhere add, the horns of the female are generally longer but less powerful\r\nthan in the male; and in some other species of rhinoceros they are said\r\nto be shorter in the female.[302] From these various facts we may\r\nconclude that horns of all kinds, even when they are equally developed\r\nin both sexes, were primarily acquired by the males in order to conquer\r\nother males, and have been transferred more or less completely to the\r\nfemale, in relation to the force of the equal form of inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe tusks of the elephant, in the different species or races, differ\r\naccording to sex, in nearly the same manner as the horns of ruminants.\r\nIn India and Malacca the males alone are provided with well-developed\r\ntusks. The elephant of Ceylon is considered by most naturalists as a\r\ndistinct race, but by some as a distinct species, and here “not one in a\r\nhundred is found with tusks, the few that possess them being exclusively\r\nmales.”[303] The African elephant is undoubtedly distinct, and the\r\nfemale has large, well-developed tusks, though not so large as those of\r\nthe male. These differences in the tusks of the several races and\r\nspecies of elephants—the great variability of the horns of deer, as\r\nnotably in the wild reindeer—the occasional presence of horns in the\r\nfemale _Antilope bezoartica_—the presence of two tusks in some few male\r\nnarwhals—the complete absence of tusks in some female walruses;—are\r\nall instances of the extreme variability of secondary sexual characters,\r\nand of their extreme liability to differ in closely-allied forms.\r\n\r\nAlthough tusks and horns appear in all cases to have been primarily\r\ndeveloped as sexual weapons, they often serve for other purposes. The\r\nelephant uses his tusks in attacking the tiger; according to Bruce, he\r\nscores the trunks of trees until they can be easily thrown down, and he\r\nlikewise thus extracts the farinaceous cores of palms; in Africa he\r\noften uses one tusk, this being always the same, to probe the ground and\r\nthus to ascertain whether it will bear his weight. The common bull\r\ndefends the herd with his horns; and the elk in Sweden has been known,\r\naccording to Lloyd, to strike a wolf dead with a single blow of his\r\ngreat horns. Many similar facts could be given. One of the most curious\r\nsecondary uses to which the horns of any animal are occasionally put, is\r\nthat observed by Captain Hutton[304] with the wild goat (_Capra\r\nægagrus_) of the Himalayas, and as it is said with the ibex, namely,\r\nthat when the male accidentally falls from a height he bends inwards his\r\nhead, and, by alighting on his massive horns, breaks the shock. The\r\nfemale cannot thus use her horns, which are smaller, but from her more\r\nquiet disposition she does not so much need this strange kind of shield.\r\n\r\nEach male animal uses his weapons in his own peculiar fashion. The\r\ncommon ram makes a charge and butts with such force with the bases of\r\nhis horns, that I have seen a powerful man knocked over as easily as a\r\nchild. Goats and certain species of sheep, for instance the _Ovis\r\ncycloceros_ of Afghanistan,[305] rear on their hind legs, and then not\r\nonly butt, but “make a cut down and a jerk up, with the ribbed front of\r\ntheir scimitar-shaped horn, as with a sabre. When the _O. cycloceros_\r\nattacked a large domestic ram, who was a noted bruiser, he conquered him\r\nby the sheer novelty of his mode of fighting, always closing at once\r\nwith his adversary, and catching him across the face and nose with a\r\nsharp drawing jerk of his head, and then bounding out of the way before\r\nthe blow could be returned.” In Pembrokeshire a male goat, the master of\r\na flock which during several generations had run wild, was known to have\r\nkilled several other males in single combat; this goat possessed\r\nenormous horns, measuring 39 inches in a straight line from tip to tip.\r\nThe common bull, as every one knows, gores and tosses his opponent; but\r\nthe Italian buffalo is said never to use his horns, he gives a\r\ntremendous blow with his convex forehead, and then tramples on his\r\nfallen enemy with his knees—an instinct which the common bull does not\r\npossess.[306] Hence a dog who pins a buffalo by the nose is immediately\r\ncrushed. We must, however, remember that the Italian buffalo has long\r\nbeen domesticated, and it is by no means certain that the wild\r\nparent-form had similarly shaped horns. Mr. Bartlett informs me that\r\nwhen a female Cape buffalo (_Bubalus caffer_) was turned into an\r\nenclosure with a bull of the same species, she attacked him, and he in\r\nreturn pushed her about with great violence. But it was manifest to Mr.\r\nBartlett that had not the bull shewn dignified forbearance, he could\r\neasily have killed her by a single lateral thrust with his immense\r\nhorns. The giraffe uses his short hair-covered horns, which are rather\r\nlonger in the male than in the female, in a curious manner; for with his\r\nlong neck he swings his head to either side, almost upside down, with\r\nsuch force, that I have seen a hard plank deeply indented by a single\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Oryx leucoryx, male (from the Knowsley\r\nMenagerie).]\r\n\r\nWith antelopes it is sometimes difficult to imagine how they can\r\npossibly use their curiously-shaped horns; thus the spring-boc (_Ant.\r\neuchore_) has rather short upright horns, with the sharp points bent\r\ninwards almost at a right angle, so as to face each other; Mr. Bartlett\r\ndoes not know how they are used, but suggests that they would inflict a\r\nfearful wound down each side of the face of an antagonist. The\r\nslightly-curved horns of the _Oryx leucoryx_ (fig. 61) are directed\r\nbackwards, and are of such length that their points reach beyond the\r\nmiddle of the back, over which they stand in an almost parallel line.\r\nThus they seem singularly ill-fitted for fighting; but Mr. Bartlett\r\ninforms me that when two of these animals prepare for battle, they kneel\r\ndown, with their heads between their front legs, and in this attitude\r\nthe horns stand nearly parallel and close to the ground, with the points\r\ndirected forwards and a little upwards. The combatants then gradually\r\napproach each other and endeavour to get the upturned points under each\r\nother’s bodies; if one succeeds in doing this, he suddenly springs up,\r\nthrowing up his head at the same time, and can thus wound or perhaps\r\neven transfix his antagonist. Both animals always kneel down so as to\r\nguard as far as possible against this manœuvre. It has been recorded\r\nthat one of these antelopes has used his horns with effect even against\r\na lion; yet from being forced to place his head between the forelegs in\r\norder to bring the points of the horns forward, he would generally be\r\nunder a great disadvantage when attacked by any other animal. It is,\r\ntherefore, not probable that the horns have been modified into their\r\npresent great length and peculiar position, as a protection against\r\nbeasts of prey. We can, however, see that as soon as some ancient male\r\nprogenitor of the Oryx acquired moderately long horns, directed a little\r\nbackwards, he would be compelled in his battles with rival males to bend\r\nhis head somewhat inwards or downwards, as is now done by certain stags;\r\nand it is not improbable that he might have acquired the habit of at\r\nfirst occasionally and afterwards of regularly kneeling down. In this\r\ncase it is almost certain that the males which possessed the longest\r\nhorns would have had a great advantage over others with shorter horns;\r\nand then the horns would gradually have been rendered longer and longer,\r\nthrough sexual selection, until they acquired their present\r\nextraordinary length and position.\r\n\r\nWith stags of many kinds the branching of the horns offers a curious\r\ncase of difficulty; for certainly a single straight point would inflict\r\na much more serious wound than several diverging points. In Sir Philip\r\nEgerton’s museum there is a horn of the red-deer (_Cervus elaphus_)\r\nthirty inches in length, with “not fewer than fifteen snags or\r\nbranches;” and at Moritzburg there is still preserved a pair of antlers\r\nof a red-deer, shot in 1699 by Frederick I., each of which bears the\r\nastonishing number of thirty-three branches. Richardson figures a pair\r\nof antlers of the wild reindeer with twenty-nine points.[307] From the\r\nmanner in which the horns are branched, and more especially from deer\r\nbeing known occasionally to fight together by kicking with their\r\nfore-feet,[308] M. Bailly actually came to the conclusion that their\r\nhorns were more injurious than useful to them! But this author overlooks\r\nthe pitched battles between rival males. As I felt much perplexed about\r\nthe use or advantage of the branches, I applied to Mr. McNeill of\r\nColinsay, who has long and carefully observed the habits of red-deer,\r\nand he informs me that he has never seen some of the branches brought\r\ninto action, but that the brow-antlers, from inclining downwards, are a\r\ngreat protection to the forehead, and their points are likewise used in\r\nattack. Sir Philip Egerton also informs me in regard both to red-deer\r\nand fallow-deer, that when they fight they suddenly dash together, and\r\ngetting their horns fixed against each other’s bodies a desperate\r\nstruggle ensues. When one is at last forced to yield and turn round, the\r\nvictor endeavours to plunge his brow-antlers into his defeated foe. It\r\nthus appears that the upper branches are used chiefly or exclusively for\r\npushing and fencing. Nevertheless with some species the upper branches\r\nare used as weapons of offence; when a man was attacked by a Wapiti\r\ndeer (_Cervus Canadensis_) in Judge Caton’s park in Ottawa, and several\r\nmen tried to rescue him, the stag “never raised his head from the\r\nground; in fact he kept his face almost flat on the ground, with his\r\nnose nearly between his fore-feet, except when he rolled his head to one\r\nside to take a new observation preparatory to a plunge.” In this\r\nposition the terminal points of the horns were directed against his\r\nadversaries. “In rolling his head he necessarily raised it somewhat,\r\nbecause his antlers were so long that he could not roll his head without\r\nraising them on one side, while on the other side they touched the\r\nground.” The stag by this procedure gradually drove the party of\r\nrescuers backwards, to a distance of 150 or 200 feet; and the attacked\r\nman was killed.[309]\r\n\r\nAlthough the horns of stags are efficient weapons, there can, I think,\r\nbe no doubt that a single point would have been much more dangerous than\r\na branched antler; and Judge Caton, who has had large experience with\r\ndeer, fully concurs in this conclusion. Nor do the branching horns,\r\nthough highly important as a means of defence against rival stags,\r\nappear perfectly well adapted for this purpose, as they are liable to\r\nbecome interlocked. The suspicion has therefore crossed my mind that\r\nthey may serve partly as ornaments. That the branched antlers of stags,\r\nas well as the elegant lyrated horns of certain antelopes, with their\r\ngraceful double curvature, (fig. 62), are ornamental in our eyes, no one\r\nwill dispute. If, then, the horns, like the splendid accoutrements of\r\nthe knights of old, add to the noble appearance of stags and antelopes,\r\nthey may have been partly modified for this purpose, though mainly for\r\nactual service in battle; but I have no evidence in favour of this\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Strepsiceros Kudu (from Andrew Smith’s ‘Zoology\r\nof South Africa’).]\r\n\r\nAn interesting case has lately been published, from which it appears\r\nthat the horns of a deer in one district in the United States are now\r\nbeing modified through sexual and natural selection. A writer in an\r\nexcellent American Journal[310] says, that he has hunted for the last\r\ntwenty-one years in the Adirondacks, where the _Cervus Virginianus_\r\nabounds. About fourteen years ago he first heard of _spike-horn bucks_.\r\nThese became from year to year more common; about five years ago he shot\r\none, and subsequently another, and now they are frequently killed. “The\r\nspike-horn differs greatly from the common antler of the _C.\r\nVirginianus_. It consists of a single spike, more slender than the\r\nantler, and scarcely half so long, projecting forward from the brow, and\r\nterminating in a very sharp point. It gives a considerable advantage to\r\nits possessor over the common buck. Besides enabling him to run more\r\nswiftly through the thick woods and underbrush (every hunter knows that\r\ndoes and yearling bucks run much more rapidly than the large bucks when\r\narmed with their cumbrous antlers), the spike-horn is a more effective\r\nweapon than the common antler. With this advantage the spike-horn bucks\r\nare gaining upon the common bucks, and may, in time, entirely supersede\r\nthem in the Adirondacks. Undoubtedly the first spike-horn buck was\r\nmerely an accidental freak of nature. But his spike-horns gave him an\r\nadvantage, and enabled him to propagate his peculiarity. His\r\ndescendants, having a like advantage, have propagated the peculiarity in\r\na constantly increasing ratio, till they are slowly crowding the\r\nantlered deer from the region they inhabit.”\r\n\r\nMale quadrupeds which are furnished with tusks use them in various ways,\r\nas in the case of horns. The boar strikes laterally and upwards; the\r\nmusk-deer with serious effect downwards.[311] The walrus, though having\r\nso short a neck and so unwieldy a body, “can strike either upwards, or\r\ndownwards, or sideways, with equal dexterity.”[312] The Indian elephant\r\nfights, as I was informed by the late Dr. Falconer, in a different\r\nmanner according to the position and curvature of his tusks. When they\r\nare directed forwards and upwards he is able to fling a tiger to a great\r\ndistance—it is said to even thirty feet; when they are short and turned\r\ndownwards he endeavours suddenly to pin the tiger to the ground, and in\r\nconsequence is dangerous to the rider, who is liable to be jerked off\r\nthe hoodah.[313]\r\n\r\nVery few male quadrupeds possess weapons of two distinct kinds specially\r\nadapted for fighting with rival males. The male muntjac-deer\r\n(_Cervulus_), however, offers an exception, as he is provided with horns\r\nand exserted canine teeth. But one form of weapon, has often been\r\nreplaced in the course of ages by another form, as we may infer from\r\nwhat follows. With ruminants the development of horns generally stands\r\nin an inverse relation with that of even moderately well-developed\r\ncanine teeth. Thus camels, guanacoes, chevrotains and musk-deer, are\r\nhornless, and they have efficient canines; these teeth being “always of\r\nsmaller size in the females than in the males.” The Camelidæ have in\r\ntheir upper jaws, in addition to their true canines, a pair of\r\ncanine-shaped incisors.[314] Male deer and antelopes, on the other hand,\r\npossess horns, and they rarely have canine teeth; and these when present\r\nare always of small size, so that it is doubtful whether they are of\r\nany service in their battles. With _Antilope montana_ they exist only as\r\nrudiments in the young male, disappearing as he grows old; and they are\r\nabsent in the female at all ages; but the females of certain other\r\nantelopes and deer have been known occasionally to exhibit rudiments of\r\nthese teeth.[315] Stallions have small canine teeth, which are either\r\nquite absent or rudimentary in the mare; but they do not appear to be\r\nused in fighting, for stallions bite with their incisors, and do not\r\nopen their mouths widely like camels and guanacoes. Whenever the adult\r\nmale possesses canines now in an inefficient state, whilst the female\r\nhas either none or mere rudiments, we may conclude that the early male\r\nprogenitor of the species was provided with efficient canines, which had\r\nbeen partially transferred to the females. The reduction of these teeth\r\nin the males seems to have followed from some change in their manner of\r\nfighting, often caused (but not in the case of the horse) by the\r\ndevelopment of new weapons.\r\n\r\nTusks and horns are manifestly of high importance to their possessors,\r\nfor their development consumes much organised matter. A single tusk of\r\nthe Asiatic elephant,—one of the extinct woolly species,—and of the\r\nAfrican elephant, have been known to weigh respectively 150, 160, and\r\n180 pounds; and even greater weights have been assigned by some\r\nauthors.[316] With deer, in which the horns are periodically renewed,\r\nthe drain on the constitution must be greater; the horns, for instance,\r\nof the moose weigh from fifty to sixty pounds, and those of the extinct\r\nIrish elk from sixty to seventy pounds,—the skull of the latter\r\nweighing on an average only five and a quarter pounds. With sheep,\r\nalthough the horns are not periodically renewed, yet their development,\r\nin the opinion of many agriculturists, entails a sensible loss to the\r\nbreeder. Stags, moreover, in escaping from beasts of prey are loaded\r\nwith an additional weight for the race, and are greatly retarded in\r\npassing through a woody country. The moose, for instance, with horns\r\nextending five and a half feet from tip to tip, although so skilful in\r\ntheir use that he will not touch or break a dead twig when walking\r\nquietly, cannot act so dexterously whilst rushing away from a pack of\r\nwolves. “During his progress he holds his nose up, so as to lay the\r\nhorns horizontally back; and in this attitude cannot see the ground\r\ndistinctly.”[317] The tips of the horns of the great Irish elk were\r\nactually eight feet apart! Whilst the horns are covered with velvet,\r\nwhich lasts with the red-deer for about twelve weeks, they are extremely\r\nsensitive to a blow; so that in Germany the stags at this time change\r\ntheir habits to a certain extent, and avoid dense forests, frequenting\r\nyoung woods and low thickets.[318] These facts remind us, that male\r\nbirds have acquired ornamental plumes at the cost of retarded flight,\r\nand other ornaments at the cost of some loss of power in their battles\r\nwith rival males.\r\n\r\nWith quadrupeds, when, as is often the case, the sexes differ in size,\r\nthe males are, I believe, always larger and stronger. This holds good in\r\na marked manner, as I am informed by Mr. Gould, with the marsupials of\r\nAustralia, the males of which appear to continue growing until an\r\nunusually late age. But the most extraordinary case is that of one of\r\nthe seals (_Callorhinus ursinus_), a full-grown female weighing less\r\nthan one-sixth of a full-grown male.[319] The greater strength of the\r\nmale is invariably displayed, as Hunter long ago remarked,[320] in those\r\nparts of the body which are brought into action in fighting with rival\r\nmales,—for instance, in the massive neck of the bull. Male quadrupeds\r\nare also more courageous and pugnacious than the females. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that these characters have been gained, partly through\r\nsexual selection, owing to a long series of victories by the stronger\r\nand more courageous males over the weaker, and partly through the\r\ninherited effects of use. It is probable that the successive variations\r\nin strength, size, and courage, whether due to so-called spontaneous\r\nvariability or to the effects of use, by the accumulation of which male\r\nquadrupeds have acquired these characteristic qualities, occurred rather\r\nlate in life, and were consequently to a large extent limited in their\r\ntransmission to the same sex.\r\n\r\nUnder this point of view I was anxious to obtain information in regard\r\nto the Scotch deerhound, the sexes of which differ more in size than\r\nthose of any other breed (though blood-hounds differ considerably), or\r\nthan in any wild canine species known to me.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I applied to Mr. Cupples, a well-known breeder of these\r\ndogs, who has weighed and measured many of his own dogs, and who, with\r\ngreat kindness, has collected for me the following facts from various\r\nsources. Superior male dogs, measured at the shoulder, range from\r\ntwenty-eight inches, which is low, to thirty-three, or even thirty-four\r\ninches in height; and in weight from eighty pounds, which is low, to\r\n120, or even more pounds. The females range in height from twenty-three\r\nto twenty-seven, or even to twenty-eight inches; and in weight from\r\nfifty to seventy, or even eighty pounds.[321] Mr. Cupples concludes that\r\nfrom ninety-five to one hundred pounds for the male, and seventy for the\r\nfemale, would be a safe average; but there is reason to believe that\r\nformerly both sexes attained a greater weight. Mr. Cupples has weighed\r\npuppies when a fortnight old; in one litter the average weight of four\r\nmales exceeded that of two females by six and a half ounces; in another\r\nlitter the average weight of four males exceeded that of one female by\r\nless than one ounce; the same males, when three weeks old, exceeded the\r\nfemale by seven and a half ounces, and at the age of six weeks by nearly\r\nfourteen ounces. Mr. Wright of Yeldersley House, in a letter to Mr.\r\nCupples, says: “I have taken notes on the sizes and weights of puppies\r\nof many litters, and as far as my experience goes, dog-puppies as a rule\r\ndiffer very little from bitches till they arrive at about five or six\r\nmonths old; and then the dogs begin to increase, gaining upon the\r\nbitches both in weight and size. At birth, and for several weeks\r\nafterwards, a bitch-puppy will occasionally be larger than any of the\r\ndogs, but they are invariably beaten by them later.” Mr. McNeill, of\r\nColinsay, concludes that “the males do not attain their full growth till\r\nover two years old, though the females attain it sooner.” According to\r\nMr. Cupples’ experience, male dogs go on growing in stature till they\r\nare from twelve to eighteen months old, and in weight till from eighteen\r\nto twenty-four months old; whilst the females cease increasing in\r\nstature at the age of from nine to fourteen or fifteen months, and in\r\nweight at the age of from twelve to fifteen months. From these various\r\nstatements it is clear that the full difference in size between the male\r\nand female Scotch deerhound is not acquired until rather late in life.\r\nThe males are almost exclusively used for coursing, for, as Mr. McNeill\r\ninforms me, the females have not sufficient strength and weight to pull\r\ndown a full-grown deer. From the names used in old legends, it appears,\r\nas I hear from Mr. Cupples, that at a very ancient period the males were\r\nthe most celebrated, the females being mentioned only as the mothers of\r\nfamous dogs. Hence during many generations, it is the male which has\r\nbeen chiefly tested for strength, size, speed, and courage, and the best\r\nwill have been bred from. As, however, the males do not attain their\r\nfull dimensions until a rather late period in life, they will have\r\ntended, in accordance with the law often indicated, to transmit their\r\ncharacters to their male offspring alone; and thus the great inequality\r\nin size between the sexes of the Scotch deerhound may probably be\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63. Head of common wild boar, in prime of life (from\r\nBrehm).]\r\n\r\nThe males of some few quadrupeds possess organs or parts developed\r\nsolely as a means of defence against the attacks of other males. Some\r\nkinds of deer use, as we have seen, the upper branches of their horns\r\nchiefly or exclusively for defending themselves; and the Oryx antelope,\r\nas I am informed by Mr. Bartlett, fences most skilfully with his long,\r\ngently curved horns; but these are likewise used as organs of offence.\r\nRhinoceroses, as the same observer remarks, in fighting parry each\r\nother’s sidelong blows with their horns, which loudly clatter together,\r\nas do the tusks of boars. Although wild boars fight desperately\r\ntogether, they seldom, according to Brehm, receive fatal blows, as these\r\nfall on each other’s tusks, or on the layer of gristly skin covering the\r\nshoulder, which the German hunters call the shield; and here we have a\r\npart specially modified for defence. With boars in the prime of life\r\n(see fig. 63) the tusks in the lower jaw are used for fighting but they\r\nbecome in old age, as Brehm states, so much curved inwards and upwards,\r\nover the snout, that they can no longer be thus used. They may, however,\r\nstill continue to serve, and even in a still more effective manner, as a\r\nmeans of defence. In compensation for the loss of the lower tusks as\r\nweapons of offence, those in the upper jaw, which always project a\r\nlittle laterally, increase so much in length during old age, and curve\r\nso much upwards, that they can be used as a means of attack.\r\nNevertheless an old boar is not so dangerous to man as one at the age\r\nof six or seven years.[322]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 64. Skull of the Babirusa Pig (from Wallace’s ‘Malay\r\nArchipelago’)]\r\n\r\nIn the full-grown male Babirusa pig of Celebes (fig. 64), the lower\r\ntusks are formidable weapons, like those of the European boar in the\r\nprime of life, whilst the upper tusks are so long and have their points\r\nso much curled inwards, sometimes even touching the forehead, that they\r\nare utterly useless as weapons of attack. They more nearly resemble\r\nhorns than teeth, and are so manifestly useless as teeth that the animal\r\nwas formerly supposed to rest his head by hooking them on to a branch.\r\nTheir convex surfaces would, however, if the head were held a little\r\nlaterally, serve as an excellent guard; and hence, perhaps it is that in\r\nold animals they “are generally broken off, as if by fighting.”[323]\r\nHere, then, we have the curious case of the upper tusks of the Babirusa\r\nregularly assuming during the prime of life, a structure which\r\napparently renders them fitted only for defence; whilst in the European\r\nboar the lower and opposite tusks assume in a less degree and only\r\nduring old age nearly the same form, and then serve in like manner\r\nsolely for defence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. Head of Æthiopian Wart-hog, from ‘Proc. Zool.\r\nSoc.’ 1869. (I now find that this drawing represents the head of a\r\nfemale, but it serves to shew, on a reduced scale, the characters of the\r\nmale.)]\r\n\r\nIn the wart-hog (_Phacochœrus æthiopicus_, fig. 65) the tusks in the\r\nupper jaw of the male curve upwards during the prime of life, and from\r\nbeing pointed, serve as formidable weapons. The tusks in the lower jaw\r\nare sharper than those in the upper, but from their shortness it seems\r\nhardly possible that they can be used as weapons of attack. They must,\r\nhowever, greatly strengthen those in the upper jaw, from being ground\r\nso as to fit closely against their bases. Neither the upper nor the\r\nlower tusks appear to have been specially modified to act as guards,\r\nthough, no doubt, they are thus used to a certain extent. But the\r\nwart-hog is not destitute of other special means of protection, for\r\nthere exists, on each side of the face, beneath the eyes, a rather\r\nstiff, yet flexible, cartilaginous, oblong pad (fig. 65), which projects\r\ntwo or three inches outwards; and it appeared to Mr. Bartlett and\r\nmyself, when viewing the living animal, that these pads, when struck\r\nfrom beneath by the tusks of an opponent, would be turned upwards, and\r\nwould thus protect in an admirable manner the somewhat prominent eyes.\r\nThese boars, as I may add on the authority of Mr. Bartlett, when\r\nfighting together, stand directly face to face.\r\n\r\nLastly, the African river-hog (_Potamochoerus penicillatus_) has a hard\r\ncartilaginous knob on each side of the face beneath the eyes, which\r\nanswers to the flexible pad of the wart-hog; it has also two bony\r\nprominences on the upper jaw above the nostrils. A boar of this species\r\nin the Zoological Gardens recently broke into the cage of the wart-hog.\r\nThey fought all night-long, and were found in the morning much\r\nexhausted, but not seriously wounded. It is a significant fact, as\r\nshewing the purpose of the above-described projections and excrescences,\r\nthat these were covered with blood, and were scored and abraded in an\r\nextraordinary manner.\r\n\r\nThe mane of the lion forms a good defence against the one danger to\r\nwhich he is liable, namely the attacks of rival lions: for the males, as\r\nSir. A. Smith informs me, engage in terrible battles, and a young lion\r\ndares not approach an old one. In 1857 a tiger at Bromwich broke into\r\nthe cage of a lion, and a fearful scene ensued; “the lion’s mane saved\r\nhis neck and head from being much injured, but the tiger at last\r\nsucceeded in ripping up his belly, and in a few minutes he was\r\ndead.”[324] The broad ruff round the throat and chin of the Canadian\r\nlynx (_Felis Canadensis_) is much longer in the male than in the female;\r\nbut whether it serves as a defence I do not know. Male seals are well\r\nknown to fight desperately together, and the males of certain kinds\r\n(_Otaria jubata_)[325] have great manes, whilst the females have small\r\nones or none. The male baboon of the Cape of Good Hope (_Cynocephalus\r\nporcarius_) has a much longer mane and larger canine teeth than the\r\nfemale; and the mane probably serves as a protection, for on asking the\r\nkeepers in the Zoological Gardens, without giving them any clue to my\r\nobject, whether any of the monkeys especially attacked each other by the\r\nnape of the neck, I was answered that this was not the case, excepting\r\nwith the above baboon. In the Hamadryas baboon, Ehrenberg compares the\r\nmane of the adult male to that of a young lion, whilst in the young of\r\nboth sexes and in the female the mane is almost absent.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me probable that the immense woolly mane of the male\r\nAmerican bison, which reaches almost to the ground, and is much more\r\ndeveloped in the males than in the females, served as a protection to\r\nthem in their terrible battles; but an experienced hunter told Judge\r\nCaton that he had never observed anything which favoured this belief.\r\nThe stallion has a thicker and fuller mane than the mare; and I have\r\nmade particular inquiries of two great trainers and breeders who have\r\nhad charge of many entire horses, and am assured that they “invariably\r\nendeavour to seize one another by the neck.” It does not, however,\r\nfollow from the foregoing statements, that when the hair on the neck\r\nserves as a defence, that it was originally developed for this purpose,\r\nthough this is probable in some cases, as in that of the lion. I am\r\ninformed by Mr. McNeill that the long hairs on the throat of the stag\r\n(_Cervus elephas_) serve as a great protection to him when hunted, for\r\nthe dogs generally endeavour to seize him by the throat; but it is not\r\nprobable that these hairs were specially developed for this purpose;\r\notherwise the young and the females would, as we may feel assured, have\r\nbeen equally protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Preference or Choice in Pairing, as shewn by either sex of\r\nQuadrupeds._—Before describing, in the next chapter, the differences\r\nbetween the sexes in voice, odour emitted, and ornamentation, it will be\r\nconvenient here to consider whether the sexes exert any choice in their\r\nunions. Does the female prefer any particular male, either before or\r\nafter the males may have fought together for supremacy; or does the\r\nmale, when not a polygamist, select any particular female? The general\r\nimpression amongst breeders seems to be that the male accepts any\r\nfemale; and this, owing to his eagerness, is, in most cases, probably\r\nthe truth. Whether the female as a general rule indifferently accepts\r\nany male is much more doubtful. In the fourteenth chapter, on Birds, a\r\nconsiderable body of direct and indirect evidence was advanced, shewing\r\nthat the female selects her partner; and it would be a strange anomaly\r\nif female quadrupeds, which stand higher in the scale of organisation\r\nand have higher mental powers, did not generally, or at least often,\r\nexert some choice. The female could in most cases escape, if wooed by a\r\nmale that did not please or excite her; and when pursued, as so\r\nincessantly occurs, by several males, she would often have the\r\nopportunity, whilst they were fighting together, of escaping with, or at\r\nleast of temporarily pairing with, some one male. This latter\r\ncontingency has often been observed in Scotland with female red-deer, as\r\nI have been informed by Sir Philip Egerton.[326]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible that much should be known about female\r\nquadrupeds exerting in a state of nature any choice in their marriage\r\nunions. The following very curious details on the courtship of one of\r\nthe eared seals, _Callorhinus ursinus_, are given[327] on the authority\r\nof Capt. Bryant, who had ample opportunities for observation. He says,\r\n“Many of the females on their arrival at the island where they breed\r\nappear desirous of returning to some particular male, and frequently\r\nclimb the outlying rocks to overlook the rookeries, calling out and\r\nlistening as if for a familiar voice. Then changing to another place\r\nthey do the same again.... As soon as a female reaches the shore, the\r\nnearest male goes down to meet her, making meanwhile a noise like the\r\nclucking of a hen to her chickens. He bows to her and coaxes her until\r\nhe gets between her and the water so that she cannot escape him. Then\r\nhis manner changes, and with a harsh growl he drives her to a place in\r\nhis harem. This continues until the lower row of harems is nearly full.\r\nThen the males higher up select the time when their more fortunate\r\nneighbours are off their guard to steal their wives. This they do by\r\ntaking them in their mouths and lifting them over the heads of the other\r\nfemales, and carefully placing them in their own harem, carrying them as\r\ncats do their kittens. Those still higher up pursue the same method\r\nuntil the whole space is occupied. Frequently a struggle ensues between\r\ntwo males for the possession of the same female, and both seizing her at\r\nonce pull her in two or terribly lacerate her with their teeth. When the\r\nspace is all filled, the old male walks around complacently reviewing\r\nhis family, scolding those who crowd or disturb the others, and fiercely\r\ndriving off all intruders. This surveillance always keeps him actively\r\noccupied.”\r\n\r\nAs so little is known about the courtship of animals in a state of\r\nnature, I have endeavoured to discover how far our domesticated\r\nquadrupeds evince any choice in their unions. Dogs offer the best\r\nopportunity for observation, as they are carefully attended to and well\r\nunderstood. Many breeders have expressed a strong opinion on this head.\r\nThus Mr. Mayhew remarks, “The females are able to bestow their\r\naffections; and tender recollections are as potent over them as they are\r\nknown to be in other cases, where higher animals are concerned. Bitches\r\nare not always prudent in their loves, but are apt to fling themselves\r\naway on curs of low degree. If reared with a companion of vulgar\r\nappearance, there often springs up between the pair a devotion which no\r\ntime can afterwards subdue. The passion, for such it really is, becomes\r\nof a more than romantic endurance.” Mr. Mayhew, who attended chiefly to\r\nthe smaller breeds, is convinced that the females are strongly attracted\r\nby males of large size.[328] The well-known veterinary Blaine\r\nstates[329] that his own female pug became so attached to a spaniel, and\r\na female setter to a cur, that in neither case would they pair with a\r\ndog of their own breed until several weeks had elapsed. Two similar and\r\ntrustworthy accounts have been given me in regard to a female retriever\r\nand a spaniel, both of which became enamoured with terrier-dogs.\r\n\r\nMr. Cupples informs me that he can personally vouch for the accuracy of\r\nthe following more remarkable case, in which a valuable and\r\nwonderfully-intelligent female terrier loved a retriever, belonging to a\r\nneighbour, to such a degree that she had often to be dragged away from\r\nhim. After their permanent separation, although repeatedly shewing milk\r\nin her teats, she would never acknowledge the courtship of any other\r\ndog, and to the regret of her owner, never bore puppies. Mr. Cupples\r\nalso states that a female deerhound now (1868) in his kennel has thrice\r\nproduced puppies, and on each occasion shewed a marked preference for\r\none of the largest and handsomest, but not the most eager, of four\r\ndeerhounds living with her, all in the prime of life. Mr. Cupples has\r\nobserved that the female generally favours a dog whom she has associated\r\nwith and knows; her shyness and timidity at first incline her against a\r\nstrange dog. The male, on the contrary, seems rather inclined towards\r\nstrange females. It appears to be rare when the male refuses any\r\nparticular female, but Mr. Wright, of Yeldersley House, a great breeder\r\nof dogs, informs me that he has known some instances; he cites the case\r\nof one of his own deerhounds, who would not take any notice of a\r\nparticular female mastiff, so that another deerhound had to be\r\nemployed. It would be superfluous to give other cases, and I will only\r\nadd that Mr. Barr, who has carefully bred many blood-hounds, states that\r\nin almost every instance particular individuals of the opposite sex shew\r\na decided preference for each other. Finally Mr. Cupples, after\r\nattending to this subject for another year, has recently written to me,\r\n“I have had full confirmation of my former statement, that dogs in\r\nbreeding form decided preferences for each other, being often influenced\r\nby size, bright colour, and individual character, as well as by the\r\ndegree of their previous familiarity.”\r\n\r\nIn regard to horses, Mr. Blenkiron, the greatest breeder of race-horses\r\nin the world, informs me that stallions are so frequently capricious in\r\ntheir choice, rejecting one mare and without any apparent cause taking\r\nto another, that various artifices have to be habitually used. The\r\nfamous Monarque, for instance, would never consciously look at the dam\r\nof Gladiateur, and a trick had to be practised. We can partly see the\r\nreason why valuable race-horse stallions, which are in such demand,\r\nshould be so particular in their choice. Mr. Blenkiron has never known a\r\nmare to reject a horse; but this has occurred in Mr. Wright’s stable, so\r\nthat the mare had to be cheated. Prosper Lucas[330] quotes various\r\nstatements from French authorities, and remarks, “On voit des étalons\r\nqui s’éprennent d’une jument, et négligent toutes les autres.” He gives,\r\non the authority of Baëlen, similar facts in regard to bulls. Hoffberg,\r\nin describing the domesticated reindeer of Lapland, says, “Fœmina\r\nmajores et fortiores mares præ cæteris admittunt, ad eos confugiunt, a\r\njunioribus agitatæ, qui hos in fugam conjiciunt.”[331] A clergyman, who\r\nhas bred many pigs, assures me that sows often reject one boar and\r\nimmediately accept another.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts there can be no doubt that with most of our\r\ndomesticated quadrupeds strong individual antipathies and preferences\r\nare frequently exhibited, and much more commonly by the female than by\r\nthe male. This being the case, it is improbable that the unions of\r\nquadrupeds in a state of nature should be left to mere chance. It is\r\nmuch more probable that the females are allured or excited by particular\r\nmales, who possess certain characters in a higher degree than other\r\nmales; but what these characters are, we can seldom or never discover\r\nwith certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAMMALS—_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Voice—Remarkable sexual peculiarities in\r\n   seals—Odour—Development of the hair—Colour of the hair and\r\n   skin—Anomalous case of the female being more ornamented than\r\n   the male—Colour and ornaments due to sexual selection—Colour\r\n   acquired for the sake of protection—Colour, though common to\r\n   both sexes, often due to sexual selection—On the\r\n   disappearance of spots and stripes in adult quadrupeds—On the\r\n   colours and ornaments of the Quadrumana—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuadrupeds use their voices for various purposes, as a signal of danger,\r\nas a call from one member of a troop to another, or from the mother to\r\nher lost offspring, or from the latter for protection to their mother;\r\nbut such uses need not here be considered. We are concerned only with\r\nthe difference between the voices of the two sexes, for instance between\r\nthat of the lion and lioness, or of the bull and cow. Almost all male\r\nanimals use their voices much more during the rutting-season than at any\r\nother time; and some, as the giraffe and porcupine,[332] are said to be\r\ncompletely mute excepting at this season. As the throats (i.e. the\r\nlarynx and thyroid bodies[333]) of stags become periodically enlarged at\r\nthe commencement of the breeding-season, it might be thought that their\r\npowerful voices must be then in some way of high importance to them; but\r\nthis is very doubtful. From information given to me by two experienced\r\nobservers, Mr. McNeill and Sir P. Egerton, it seems that young stags\r\nunder three years old do not roar or bellow; and that the old ones begin\r\nbellowing at the commencement of the breeding-season, at first only\r\noccasionally and moderately, whilst they restlessly wander about in\r\nsearch of the females. Their battles are prefaced by loud and prolonged\r\nbellowing, but during the actual conflict they are silent. Animals of\r\nall kinds which habitually use their voices, utter various noises under\r\nany strong emotion, as when enraged and preparing to fight; but this may\r\nmerely be the result of their nervous excitement, which leads to the\r\nspasmodic contraction of almost all the muscles of the body, as when a\r\nman grinds his teeth and clenches his hands in rage or agony. No doubt\r\nstags challenge each other to mortal combat by bellowing; but it is not\r\nlikely that this habit could have led through sexual selection, that is\r\nby the loudest-voiced males having been the most successful in their\r\nconflicts, to the periodical enlargement of the vocal organs; for the\r\nstags with the most powerful voices, unless at the same time the\r\nstrongest, best-armed, and most courageous, would not have gained any\r\nadvantage over their rivals with weaker voices. The stags, moreover,\r\nwhich had weaker voices, though not so well able to challenge other\r\nstags, would have been drawn to the place of combat as certainly as\r\nthose with stronger voices.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the roaring of the lion may be of some actual\r\nservice to him in striking terror into his adversary; for when enraged\r\nhe likewise erects his mane and thus instinctively tries to make himself\r\nappear as terrible as possible. But it can hardly be supposed that the\r\nbellowing of the stag, even if it be of any service to him in this way,\r\ncan have been important enough to have led to the periodical enlargement\r\nof the throat. Some writers suggest that the bellowing serves as a call\r\nto the female; but the experienced observers above quoted inform me that\r\nfemale deer do not search for the male, though the males search eagerly\r\nfor the females, as indeed might be expected from what we know of the\r\nhabits of other male quadrupeds. The voice of the female, on the other\r\nhand, quickly brings to her one or more stags,[334] as is well known to\r\nthe hunters who in wild countries imitate her cry. If we could believe\r\nthat the male had the power to excite or allure the female by his voice,\r\nthe periodical enlargement of his vocal organs would be intelligible on\r\nthe principle of sexual selection, together with inheritance limited to\r\nthe same sex and season of the year; but we have no evidence in favour\r\nof this view. As the case stands, the loud voice of the stag during the\r\nbreeding season does not seem to be of any special service to him,\r\neither during his courtship or battles, or in any other way. But may we\r\nnot believe that the frequent use of the voice, under the strong\r\nexcitement of love, jealousy, and rage, continued during many\r\ngenerations, may at last have produced an inherited effect on the vocal\r\norgans of the stag, as well as of other male animals? This appears to\r\nme, with our present state of knowledge, the most probable view.\r\n\r\nThe male gorilla has a tremendous voice, and when adult is furnished\r\nwith a laryngeal sack, as is likewise the adult male orang.[335] The\r\ngibbons rank amongst the noisiest of monkeys, and the Sumatra species\r\n(_Hylobates syndactylus_) is also furnished with a laryngeal sack; but\r\nMr. Blyth, who has had opportunities for observation, does not believe\r\nthat the male is more noisy than the female. Hence, these latter monkeys\r\nprobably use their voices as a mutual call; and this is certainly the\r\ncase with some quadrupeds, for instance with the beaver.[336] Another\r\ngibbon, the _H. agilis_, is highly remarkable, from having the power of\r\nemitting a complete and correct octave of musical notes,[337] which we\r\nmay reasonably suspect serves as a sexual charm; but I shall have to\r\nrecur to this subject in the next chapter. The vocal organs of the\r\nAmerican _Mycetes caraya_ are one-third larger in the male than in the\r\nfemale, and are wonderfully powerful. These monkeys, when the weather is\r\nwarm, make the forests resound during the morning and evening with their\r\noverwhelming voices. The males begin the dreadful concert, in which the\r\nfemales, with their less powerful voices, sometimes join, and which is\r\noften continued during many hours. An excellent observer, Rengger,[338]\r\ncould not perceive that they were excited to begin their concert by any\r\nspecial cause; he thinks that like many birds, they delight in their own\r\nmusic, and try to excel each other. Whether most of the foregoing\r\nmonkeys have acquired their powerful voices in order to beat their\r\nrivals and to charm the females—or whether the vocal organs have been\r\nstrengthened and enlarged through the inherited effects of\r\nlong-continued use without any particular good being gained—I will not\r\npretend to say; but the former view, at least in the case of the\r\n_Hylobates agilis_, seems the most probable.\r\n\r\nI may here mention two very curious sexual peculiarities occurring in\r\nseals, because they have been supposed by some writers to affect the\r\nvoice. The nose of the male sea-elephant (_Macrorhinus proboscideus_),\r\nwhen about three years old, is greatly elongated during the\r\nbreeding-season, and can then be erected. In this state it is sometimes\r\na foot in length. The female at no period of life is thus provided, and\r\nher voice is different. That of the male consists of a wild, hoarse,\r\ngurgling noise, which is audible at a great distance, and is believed to\r\nbe strengthened by the proboscis. Lesson compares the erection of the\r\nproboscis, to the swelling of the wattles of male gallinaceous birds,\r\nwhilst they court the females. In another allied kind of seal, namely,\r\nthe bladder-nose (_Cystophora cristata_), the head is covered by a great\r\nhood or bladder. This is internally supported by the septum of the nose,\r\nwhich is produced far backwards and rises into a crest seven inches in\r\nheight. The hood is clothed with short hair, and is muscular; it can be\r\ninflated until it more than equals the whole head in size! The males\r\nwhen rutting fight furiously on the ice, and their roaring “is said to\r\nbe sometimes so loud as to be heard four miles off.” When attacked by\r\nman they likewise roar or bellow; and whenever irritated the bladder is\r\ninflated. Some naturalists believe that the voice is thus strengthened,\r\nbut various other uses have been assigned to this extraordinary\r\nstructure. Mr. R. Brown thinks that it serves as a protection against\r\naccidents of all kinds. This latter view is not probable, if what the\r\nsealers have long maintained is correct, namely, that the hood or\r\nbladder is very poorly developed in the females and in the males whilst\r\nyoung.[339]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Odour._—With some animals, as with the notorious skunk of America, the\r\noverwhelming odour which they emit appears to serve exclusively as a\r\nmeans of defence. With shrew-mice (Sorex) both sexes possess abdominal\r\nscent-glands, and there can be little doubt, from the manner in which\r\ntheir bodies are rejected by birds and beasts of prey, that their odour\r\nis protective; nevertheless the glands become enlarged in the males\r\nduring the breeding-season. In many quadrupeds the glands are of the\r\nsame size in both sexes;[340] but their use is not known. In other\r\nspecies the glands are confined to the males, or are more developed in\r\nthem than in the females; and they almost always become more active\r\nduring the rutting-season. At this period the glands on the sides of the\r\nface of the male elephant enlarge and emit a secretion having a strong\r\nmusky odour.\r\n\r\nThe rank effluvium of the male goat is well known, and that of certain\r\nmale deer is wonderfully strong and persistent. On the banks of the\r\nPlata I have perceived the whole air tainted with the odour of the male\r\n_Cervus campestris_, at the distance of half a mile to leeward of a\r\nherd; and a silk handkerchief, in which I carried home a skin, though\r\nrepeatedly used and washed, retained, when first unfolded, traces of the\r\nodour for one year and seven months. This animal does not emit its\r\nstrong odour until more than a year old, and if castrated whilst young\r\nnever emits it.[341] Besides the general odour, with which the whole\r\nbody of certain ruminants seems to be permeated during the\r\nbreeding-season, many deer, antelopes, sheep, and goats, possess\r\nodoriferous glands in various situations, more especially on their\r\nfaces. The so-called tear-sacks or suborbital pits come under this head.\r\nThese glands secrete a semi-fluid fetid matter, which is sometimes so\r\ncopious as to stain the whole face, as I have seen in the case of an\r\nantelope. They are “usually larger in the male than in the female, and\r\ntheir development is checked by castration.”[342] According to Desmarest\r\nthey are altogether absent in the female of _Antilope subgutturosa_.\r\nHence, there can be no doubt that they stand in some close relation with\r\nthe reproductive functions. They are also sometimes present, and\r\nsometimes absent, in nearly-allied forms. In the adult male musk-deer\r\n(_Moschus moschiferus_), a naked space round the tail is bedewed with an\r\nodoriferous fluid, whilst in the adult female, and in the male, until\r\ntwo years old, this space is covered with hair and is not odoriferous.\r\nThe proper musk-sack, from its position, is necessarily confined to the\r\nmale, and forms an additional scent-organ. It is a singular fact that\r\nthe matter secreted by this latter gland does not, according to Pallas,\r\nchange in consistence, or increase in quantity, during the\r\nrutting-season; nevertheless this naturalist admits that its presence is\r\nin some way connected with the act of reproduction. He gives, however,\r\nonly a conjectural and unsatisfactory explanation of its use.[343]\r\n\r\nIn most cases, when during the breeding-season the male alone emits a\r\nstrong odour, this probably serves to excite or allure the female. We\r\nmust not judge on this head by our own taste, for it is well known that\r\nrats are enticed by certain essential oils, and cats by valerian,\r\nsubstances which are far from agreeable to us; and that dogs, though\r\nthey will not eat carrion, sniff and roll in it. From the reasons given\r\nwhen discussing the voice of the stag, we may reject the idea that the\r\nodour serves to bring the females from a distance to the males. Active\r\nand long-continued use cannot here have come into play, as in the case\r\nof the vocal organs. The odour emitted must be of considerable\r\nimportance to the male, inasmuch as large and complex glands, furnished\r\nwith muscles for everting the sack, and for closing or opening the\r\norifice, have in some cases been developed. The development of these\r\norgans is intelligible through sexual selection, if the more odoriferous\r\nmales are the most successful in winning the females, and in leaving\r\noffspring to inherit their gradually-perfected glands and odours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Development of the Hair._—We have seen that male quadrupeds often have\r\nthe hair on their necks and shoulders much more developed than in the\r\nfemales; and many additional instances could be given. This sometimes\r\nserves as a defence to the male during his battles; but whether the hair\r\nin most cases has been specially developed for this purpose is very\r\ndoubtful. We may feel almost certain that this is not the case, when a\r\nthin and narrow crest runs along the whole length of the back; for a\r\ncrest of this kind would afford scarcely any protection, and the ridge\r\nof the back is not a likely place to be injured; nevertheless such\r\ncrests are sometimes confined to the males, or are much more developed\r\nin them than in the females. Two antelopes, the _Tragelaphus\r\nscriptus_[344] (see fig. 68, p. 300) and _Portax picta_, may be given as\r\ninstances. The crests of certain stags and of the male wild goat stand\r\nerect, when these animals are enraged or terrified;[345] but it can\r\nhardly be supposed that they have been acquired for the sake of exciting\r\nfear in their enemies. One of the above-named antelopes, the _Portax\r\npicta_, has a large well-defined brush of black hair on the throat, and\r\nthis is much larger in the male than in the female. In the _Ammotragus\r\ntragelaphus_ of North Africa, a member of the sheep-family, the\r\nfront-legs are almost concealed by an extraordinary growth of hair,\r\nwhich depends from the neck and upper halves of the legs; but Mr.\r\nBartlett does not believe that this mantle is of the least use to the\r\nmale, in whom it is much more developed than in the female.\r\n\r\nMale quadrupeds of many kinds differ from the females in having more\r\nhair, or hair of a different character, on certain parts of their faces.\r\nThe bull alone has curled hair on the forehead.[346] In three\r\nclosely-allied sub-genera of the goat family, the males alone possess\r\nbeards, sometimes of large size; in two other sub-genera both sexes have\r\na beard, but this disappears in some of the domestic breeds of the\r\ncommon goat; and neither sex of the Hemitragus has a beard. In the ibex\r\nthe beard is not developed during the summer, and is so small at other\r\nseasons that it may be called rudimentary.[347] With some monkeys the\r\nbeard is confined to the male, as in the Orang, or is much larger in the\r\nmale than in the female, as in the _Mycetes caraya_ and _Pithecia\r\nsatanas_ (fig. 66). So it is with the whiskers of some species of\r\nMacacus,[348] and, as we have seen, with the manes of some species of\r\nbaboons. But with most kinds of monkeys the various tufts of hair about\r\nthe face and head are alike in both sexes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. Pithecia Satanas, male (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nThe males of various members of the Ox family (Bovidæ), and of certain\r\nantelopes, are furnished with a dewlap, or great fold of skin on the\r\nneck, which is much less developed in the female.\r\n\r\nNow, what must we conclude with respect to such sexual differences as\r\nthese? No one will pretend that the beards of certain male-goats, or the\r\ndewlap of the bull, or the crests of hair along the backs of certain\r\nmale antelopes, are of any direct or ordinary use to them. It is\r\npossible that the immense beard of the male Pithecia, and the large\r\nbeard of the male Orang, may protect their throats when fighting; for\r\nthe keepers in the Zoological Gardens inform me that many monkeys attack\r\neach other by the throat: but it is not probable that the beard has been\r\ndeveloped for a distinct purpose from that which the whiskers,\r\nmoustache, and other tufts of hair on the face serve; and no one will\r\nsuppose that these are useful as a protection. Must we attribute to mere\r\npurposeless variability in the male all these appendages of hair or\r\nskin? It cannot be denied that this is possible; for with many\r\ndomesticated quadrupeds, certain characters, apparently not derived\r\nthrough reversion from any wild parent-form, have appeared in, and are\r\nconfined to, the males, or are more largely developed in them than in\r\nthe females,—for instance the hump in the male zebu-cattle of India,\r\nthe tail in fat-tailed rams, the arched outline of the forehead in the\r\nmales of several breeds of sheep, the mane in the ram of an African\r\nbreed, and, lastly, the mane, long hairs on the hinder legs, and the\r\ndewlap in the male alone of the Berbura goat.[349] The mane which occurs\r\nin the rams alone of the above-mentioned African breed of sheep, is a\r\ntrue secondary sexual character, for it is not developed, as I hear from\r\nMr. Winwood Reade, if the animal be castrated. Although we ought to be\r\nextremely cautious, as shewn in my work on ‘Variation under\r\nDomestication,’ in concluding that any character, even with animals kept\r\nby semi-civilised people, has not been subjected to selection by man,\r\nand thus augmented; yet in the cases just specified this is improbable,\r\nmore especially as the characters are confined to the males, or are more\r\nstrongly developed in them than in the females. If it were positively\r\nknown that the African ram with a mane was descended from the same\r\nprimitive stock with the other breeds of sheep, or the Berbura male-goat\r\nwith his mane, dewlap, &c., from the same stock with other goats; and if\r\nselection has not been applied to these characters, then they must be\r\ndue to simple variability, together with sexually-limited inheritance.\r\n\r\nIn this case it would appear reasonable to extend the same view to the\r\nmany analogous characters occurring in animals under a state of nature.\r\nNevertheless I cannot persuade myself that this view is applicable in\r\nmany cases, as in that of the extraordinary development of hair on the\r\nthroat and forelegs of the male Ammotragus, or of the immense beard of\r\nthe male Pithecia. With those antelopes in which the male when adult is\r\nmore strongly-coloured than the female, and with those monkeys in which\r\nthis is likewise the case, and in which the hair on the face is of a\r\ndifferent colour from that on the rest of the head, being arranged in\r\nthe most diversified and elegant manner, it seems probable that the\r\ncrests and tufts of hair have been acquired as ornaments; and this I\r\nknow is the opinion of some naturalists. If this view be correct, there\r\ncan be little doubt that they have been acquired, or at least modified,\r\nthrough sexual selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colour of the Hair and of the Naked Skin._—I will first give briefly\r\nall the cases known to me, of male quadrupeds differing in colour from\r\nthe females. With Marsupials, as I am informed by Mr. Gould, the sexes\r\nrarely differ in this respect; but the great red kangaroo offers a\r\nstriking exception, “delicate blue being the prevailing tint in those\r\nparts of the female, which in the male are red.”[350] In the _Didelphis\r\nopossum_ of Cayenne the female is said to be a little more red than the\r\nmale. With Rodents Dr. Gray remarks: “African squirrels, especially\r\nthose found in the tropical regions, have the fur much brighter and more\r\nvivid at some seasons of the year than at others, and the fur of the\r\nmale is generally brighter than that of the female.”[351] Dr. Gray\r\ninforms me that he specified the African squirrels, because, from their\r\nunusually bright colours, they best exhibit this difference. The female\r\nof the _Mus minutus_ of Russia is of a paler and dirtier tint than the\r\nmale. In some few bats the fur of the male is lighter and brighter than\r\nin the female.[352]\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial Carnivora and Insectivora rarely exhibit sexual\r\ndifferences of any kind, and their colours are almost always exactly the\r\nsame in both sexes. The ocelot (_Felis pardalis_), however, offers an\r\nexception, for the colours of the female, compared with those of the\r\nmale, are “moins apparentes, le fauve étant plus terne, le blanc moins\r\npur, les raies ayant moins de largeur et les taches moins de\r\ndiamètre.”[353] The sexes of the allied _Felis mitis_ also differ, but\r\neven in a less degree, the general hues of the female being rather paler\r\nthan in the male, with the spots less black. The marine Carnivora or\r\nSeals, on the other hand, sometimes differ considerably in colour, and\r\nthey present, as we have already seen, other remarkable sexual\r\ndifferences. Thus the male of the _Otaria nigrescens_ of the southern\r\nhemisphere is of a rich brown shade above; whilst the female, who\r\nacquires her adult tints earlier in life than the male, is dark-grey\r\nabove, the young of both sexes being of a very deep chocolate colour.\r\nThe male of the northern _Phoca groenlandica_ is tawny grey, with a\r\ncurious saddle-shaped dark mark on the back; the female is much smaller,\r\nand has a very different appearance, being “dull white or yellowish\r\nstraw-colour, with a tawny hue on the back;” the young at first are pure\r\nwhite, and can “hardly be distinguished among the icy hummocks and snow,\r\ntheir colour thus acting as a protection.”[354]\r\n\r\nWith Ruminants sexual differences of colour occur more commonly than in\r\nany other order. A difference of this kind is general with the\r\nStrepsicerene antelopes; thus the male nilghau (_Portax picta_) is\r\nbluish-grey and much darker than the female, with the square white patch\r\non the throat, the white marks on the fetlocks, and the black spots on\r\nthe ears, all much more distinct. We have seen that in this species the\r\ncrests and tufts of hair are likewise more developed in the male than in\r\nthe hornless female. The male, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, without\r\nshedding his hair, periodically becomes darker during the\r\nbreeding-season. Young males cannot be distinguished from young females\r\nuntil above twelve months old; and if the male is emasculated before\r\nthis period, he never, according to the same authority, changes colour.\r\nThe importance of this latter fact, as distinctive of sexual colouring,\r\nbecomes obvious, when we hear[355] that neither the red summer-coat nor\r\nthe blue winter-coat of the Virginian deer is at all affected by\r\nemasculation. With most or all of the highly-ornamented species of\r\nTragelaphus the males are darker than the hornless females, and their\r\ncrests of hair are more fully developed. In the male of that magnificent\r\nantelope, the _Derbyan Eland_, the body is redder, the whole neck much\r\nblacker, and the white band which separates these colours, broader, than\r\nin the female. In the Cape Eland also, the male is slightly darker than\r\nthe female.[356]\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Black-buck (_A. bezoartica_), which belongs to another\r\ntribe of antelopes, the male is very dark, almost black; whilst the\r\nhornless female is fawn-coloured. We have in this species, as Mr. Blyth\r\ninforms me, an exactly parallel series of facts, as with the _Portax\r\npicta_, namely in the male periodically changing colour during the\r\nbreeding season, in the effects of emasculation on this change, and in\r\nthe young of both sexes being undistinguishable from each other. In the\r\n_Antilope niger_ the male is black, the female as well as the young\r\nbeing brown; in _A. sing-sing_ the male is much brighter coloured than\r\nthe hornless female, and his chest and belly are blacker; in the male\r\n_A. caama_, the marks and lines which occur on various parts of the body\r\nare black instead of as in the female brown; in the brindled gnu (_A.\r\ngorgon_) “the colours of the male are nearly the same as those of the\r\nfemale, only deeper and of a brighter hue.”[357] Other analogous cases\r\ncould be added.\r\n\r\nThe Banteng bull (_Bos sondaicus_) of the Malayan archipelago is almost\r\nblack, with white legs and buttocks; the cow is of a bright dun, as are\r\nthe young males until about the age of three years, when they rapidly\r\nchange colour. The emasculated bull reverts to the colour of the female.\r\nThe female Kemas goat is paler, and the female _Capra ægagrus_ is said\r\nto be more uniformly tinted than their respective males. Deer rarely\r\npresent any sexual differences in colour. Judge Caton, however, informs\r\nme that with the males of the Wapiti deer (_Cervus Canadensis_) the\r\nneck, belly, and legs are much darker than the same parts in the female;\r\nbut during the winter the darker tints gradually fade away and\r\ndisappear. I may here mention that Judge Caton has in his park three\r\nraces of the Virginian deer, which differ slightly in colour, but the\r\ndifferences are almost exclusively confined to the blue winter or\r\nbreeding coat; so that this case may be compared with those given in a\r\nprevious chapter of closely-allied or representative species of birds\r\nwhich differ from each other only in their nuptial plumage.[358] The\r\nfemales of _Cervus paludosus_ of S. America, as well as the young of\r\nboth sexes, do not possess the black stripes on the nose, and the\r\nblackish-brown line on the breast which characterise the adult\r\nmales.[359] Lastly, the mature male of the beautifully coloured and\r\nspotted Axis deer is considerably darker, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth,\r\nthan the female; and this hue the castrated male never acquires.\r\n\r\nThe last Order which we have to consider—for I am not aware that sexual\r\ndifferences in colour occur in the other mammalian groups—is that of\r\nthe Primates. The male of the _Lemur macaco_ is coal-black, whilst the\r\nfemale is reddish-yellow, but highly variable in colour.[360] Of the\r\nQuadrumana of the New World, the females and young of _Mycetes caraya_\r\nare greyish-yellow and alike; in the second year the young male becomes\r\nreddish-brown, in the third year black, excepting the stomach, which,\r\nhowever, becomes quite black in the fourth or fifth year. There is also\r\na strongly-marked difference in colour between the sexes in _Mycetes\r\nseniculus_ and _Cebus capucinus_; the young of the former and I believe\r\nof the latter species resembling the females. With _Pithecia\r\nleucocephala_ the young likewise resemble the females, which are\r\nbrownish-black above and light rusty-red beneath, the adult males being\r\nblack. The ruff of hair round the face of _Ateles marginatus_ is tinted\r\nyellow in the male and white in the female. Turning to the Old World,\r\nthe males of _Hylobates hoolock_ are always black, with the exception of\r\na white band over the brows; the females vary from whity-brown to a dark\r\ntint mixed with black, but are never wholly black.[361] In the beautiful\r\n_Cercopithecus diana_ the head of the adult male is of an intense black,\r\nwhilst that of the female is dark grey; in the former the fur between\r\nthe thighs is of an elegant fawn-colour, in the latter it is paler. In\r\nthe equally beautiful and curious moustache monkey (_Cercopithecus\r\ncephus_) the only difference between the sexes is that the tail of the\r\nmale is chesnut and that of the female grey; but Mr. Bartlett informs me\r\nthat all the hues become more strongly pronounced in the male when\r\nadult, whilst in the female they remain as they were during youth.\r\nAccording to the coloured figures given by Solomon Müller, the male of\r\n_Semnopithecus chrysomelas_ is nearly black, the female being pale\r\nbrown. In the _Cercopithecus cynosurus_ and _griseo-viridis_ one part of\r\nthe body which is confined to the male sex is of the most brilliant blue\r\nor green, and contrasts strikingly with the naked skin on the hinder\r\npart of the body, which is vivid red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. Head of male Mandrill (from Gervais, ‘Hist. Nat\r\ndes Mammifères’).]\r\n\r\nLastly, in the Baboon family, the adult male of _Cynocephalus hamadryas_\r\ndiffers from the female not only by his immense mane, but slightly in\r\nthe colour of the hair and of the naked callosities. In the drill\r\n(_Cynocephalus leucophus_) the females and young are much\r\npaler-coloured, with less green, than the adult males. No other member\r\nof the whole class of mammals is coloured in so extraordinary a manner\r\nas the adult male mandrill (_Cynocephalus mormon_). The face at this age\r\nbecomes of a fine blue, with the ridge and tip of the nose of the most\r\nbrilliant red. According to some authors the face is also marked with\r\nwhitish stripes, and is shaded in parts with black, but the colours\r\nappear to be variable. On the forehead there is a crest of hair, and on\r\nthe chin a yellow beard. “Toutes les parties supérieures de leurs\r\ncuisses et le grand espace nu de leurs fesses sont également colorés du\r\nrouge le plus vif, avec un mélange de bleu qui ne manque réellement pas\r\nd’élégance.”[362] When the animal is excited all the naked parts become\r\nmuch more vividly tinted. Several authors have used the strongest\r\nexpressions in describing these resplendent colours, which they compare\r\nwith those of the most brilliant birds. Another most remarkable\r\npeculiarity is that when the great canine teeth are fully developed,\r\nimmense protuberances of bone are formed on each cheek, which are deeply\r\nfurrowed longitudinally, and the naked skin over them is\r\nbrilliantly-coloured, as just described. (Fig. 67.) In the adult females\r\nand in the young of both sexes these protuberances are scarcely\r\nperceptible; and the naked parts are much less brightly coloured, the\r\nface being almost black, tinged with blue. In the adult female, however,\r\nthe nose at certain regular intervals of time becomes tinted with red.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the cases hitherto given the male is more strongly or brightly\r\ncoloured than the female, and differs in a greater degree from the young\r\nof both sexes. But as a reversed style of colouring is characteristic of\r\nthe two sexes with some few birds, so with the Rhesus monkey (_Macacus\r\nrhesus_) the female has a large surface of naked skin round the tail, of\r\na brilliant carmine red, which periodically becomes, as I was assured by\r\nthe keepers in the Zoological Gardens, even more vivid, and her face is\r\nalso pale red. On the other hand with the adult male and with the young\r\nof both sexes, as I saw in the Gardens, neither the naked skin at the\r\nposterior end of the body, nor the face, shew a trace of red. It\r\nappears, however, from some published accounts, that the male does\r\noccasionally, or during certain seasons, exhibit some traces of the red.\r\nAlthough he is thus less ornamented than the female, yet in the larger\r\nsize of his body, larger canine teeth, more developed whiskers, more\r\nprominent superciliary ridges, he follows the common rule of the male\r\nexcelling the female.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now given all the cases known to me of a difference in colour\r\nbetween the sexes of mammals. The colours of the female either do not\r\ndiffer in a sufficient degree from those of the male, or are not of a\r\nsuitable nature, to afford her protection, and therefore cannot be\r\nexplained on this principle. In some, perhaps in many cases, the\r\ndifferences may be the result of variations confined to one sex and\r\ntransmitted to the same sex, without any good having been thus gained,\r\nand therefore without the aid of selection. We have instances of this\r\nkind with our domesticated animals, as in the males of certain cats\r\nbeing rusty-red, whilst the females are tortoise-shell coloured.\r\nAnalogous cases occur under nature; Mr. Bartlett has seen many black\r\nvarieties of the jaguar, leopard, vulpine phalanger and wombat; and he\r\nis certain that all, or nearly all, were males. On the other hand, both\r\nsexes of wolves, foxes, and apparently of American squirrels, are\r\noccasionally born black. Hence it is quite possible that with some\r\nmammals the blackness of the males, especially when this colour is\r\ncongenital, may simply be the result, without the aid of selection, of\r\none or more variations having occurred, which from the first were\r\nsexually limited in their transmission. Nevertheless it can hardly be\r\nadmitted that the diversified, vivid, and contrasted colours of certain\r\nquadrupeds, for instance of the above-mentioned monkeys and antelopes,\r\ncan thus be accounted for. We should bear in mind that these colours do\r\nnot appear in the male at birth, as in the case of most ordinary\r\nvariations, but only at or near maturity; and that unlike ordinary\r\nvariations, if the male be emasculated, they never appear or\r\nsubsequently disappear. It is on the whole a much more probable\r\nconclusion that the strongly-marked colours and other ornamental\r\ncharacters of male quadrupeds are beneficial to them in their rivalry\r\nwith other males, and have consequently been acquired through sexual\r\nselection. The probability of this view is strengthened by the\r\ndifferences in colour between the sexes occurring almost exclusively, as\r\nmay be observed by going through the previous details, in those groups\r\nand subgroups of mammals, which present other and distinct secondary\r\nsexual characters; these being likewise due to the action of sexual\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nQuadrupeds manifestly take notice of colour. Sir S. Baker repeatedly\r\nobserved that the African elephant and rhinoceros attacked with special\r\nfury white or grey horses. I have elsewhere shewn[363] that half-wild\r\nhorses apparently prefer pairing with those of the same colour, and that\r\nherds of fallow-deer of a different colour, though living together, have\r\nlong kept distinct. It is a more significant fact that a female zebra\r\nwould not admit the addresses of a male ass until he was painted so as\r\nto resemble a zebra, and then, as John Hunter remarks, “she received him\r\nvery readily. In this curious fact, we have instinct excited by mere\r\ncolour, which had so strong an effect as to get the better of everything\r\nelse. But the male did not require this, the female being an animal\r\nsomewhat similar to himself, was sufficient to rouse him.”[364]\r\n\r\nIn an early chapter we have seen that the mental powers of the higher\r\nanimals do not differ in kind, though so greatly in degree, from the\r\ncorresponding powers of man, especially of the lower and barbarous\r\nraces; and it would appear that even their taste for the beautiful is\r\nnot widely different from that of the Quadrumana. As the negro of Africa\r\nraises the flesh on his face into parallel ridges “or cicatrices, high\r\nabove the natural surface, which unsightly deformities, are considered\r\ngreat personal attractions;”[365]—as negroes, as well as savages in\r\nmany parts of the world, paint their faces with red, blue, white, or\r\nblack bars,—so the male mandrill of Africa appears to have acquired his\r\ndeeply-furrowed and gaudily-coloured face from having been thus rendered\r\nattractive to the female. No doubt it is to us a most grotesque notion\r\nthat the posterior end of the body should have been coloured for the\r\nsake of ornament even more brilliantly than the face; but this is really\r\nnot more strange than that the tails of many birds should have been\r\nespecially decorated.\r\n\r\nWith mammals we do not at present possess any evidence that the males\r\ntake pains to display their charms before the female; and the elaborate\r\nmanner in which this is performed by male birds, is the strongest\r\nargument in favour of the belief that the females admire, or are\r\nexcited by, the ornaments and colours displayed before them. There is,\r\nhowever, a striking parallelism between mammals and birds in all their\r\nsecondary sexual characters, namely in their weapons for fighting with\r\nrival males, in their ornamental appendages, and in their colours. In\r\nboth classes, when the male differs from the female, the young of both\r\nsexes almost always resemble each other, and in a large majority of\r\ncases resemble the adult female. In both classes the male assumes the\r\ncharacters proper to his sex shortly before the age for reproduction; if\r\nemasculated he either never acquires such characters or subsequently\r\nloses them. In both classes the change of colour is sometimes seasonal,\r\nand the tints of the naked parts sometimes become more vivid during the\r\nact of courtship. In both classes the male is almost always more vividly\r\nor strongly coloured than the female, and is ornamented with larger\r\ncrests either of hair or feathers, or other appendages. In a few\r\nexceptional cases the female in both classes is more highly ornamented\r\nthan the male. With many mammals, and at least in the case of one bird,\r\nthe male is more odoriferous than the female. In both classes the voice\r\nof the male is more powerful than that of the female. Considering this\r\nparallelism there can be little doubt that the same cause, whatever it\r\nmay be, has acted on mammals and birds; and the result, as far as\r\nornamental characters are concerned, may safely be attributed, as it\r\nappears to me, to the long-continued preference of the individuals of\r\none sex for certain individuals of the opposite sex, combined with their\r\nsuccess in leaving a larger number of offspring to inherit their\r\nsuperior attractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Equal transmission of ornamental characters to both sexes._—With many\r\nbirds, ornaments, which analogy leads us to believe were primarily\r\nacquired by the males, have been transmitted equally, or almost equally,\r\nto both sexes; and we may now enquire how far this view may be extended\r\nto mammals. With a considerable number of species, especially the\r\nsmaller kinds, both sexes have been coloured, independently of sexual\r\nselection, for the sake of protection; but not, as far as I can judge,\r\nin so many cases, nor in nearly so striking a manner as in most of the\r\nlower classes. Audubon remarks that he often mistook the musk-rat,[366]\r\nwhilst sitting on the banks of a muddy stream, for a clod of earth, so\r\ncomplete was the resemblance. The hare on her form is a familiar\r\ninstance of concealment through colour; yet this principle partly fails\r\nin a closely-allied species, namely the rabbit, for as this animal runs\r\nto its burrow, it is made conspicuous to the sportsman and no doubt to\r\nall beasts of prey, by its upturned pure-white tail. No one has ever\r\ndoubted that the quadrupeds which inhabit snow-clad regions, have been\r\nrendered white to protect them from their enemies, or to favour their\r\nstealing on their prey. In regions where snow never lies long on the\r\nground a white coat would be injurious; consequently species thus\r\ncoloured are extremely rare in the hotter parts of the world. It\r\ndeserves notice that many quadrupeds, inhabiting moderately cold\r\nregions, although they do not assume a white winter dress, become paler\r\nduring this season; and this apparently is the direct result of the\r\nconditions to which they have long been exposed. Pallas[367] states that\r\nin Siberia a change of this nature occurs with the wolf, two species of\r\nMustela, the domestic horse, the _Equus hemionus_, the domestic cow,\r\ntwo species of antelopes, the musk-deer, the roe, the elk, and reindeer.\r\nThe roe, for instance, has a red summer and a greyish-white winter coat;\r\nand the latter may perhaps serve as a protection to the animal whilst\r\nwandering through the leafless thickets, sprinkled with snow and\r\nhoar-frost. If the above named animals were gradually to extend their\r\nrange into regions perpetually covered with snow, their pale\r\nwinter-coats would probably be rendered, through natural selection,\r\nwhiter and whiter by degrees, until they became as white as snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. Tragelaphus scriptus, male (from the Knowsley\r\nMenagerie).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. Damalis pygarga, male (from the Knowsley\r\nMenagerie).]\r\n\r\nAlthough we must admit that many quadrupeds have received their present\r\ntints as a protection, yet with a host of species, the colours are far\r\ntoo conspicuous and too singularly arranged to allow us to suppose that\r\nthey serve for this purpose. We may take as an illustration certain\r\nantelopes: when we see that the square white patch on the throat, the\r\nwhite marks on the fetlocks, and the round black spots on the ears, are\r\nall more distinct in the male of the _Portax picta_, than in the\r\nfemale;—when we see that the colours are more vivid, that the narrow\r\nwhite lines on the flank and the broad white bar on the shoulder are\r\nmore distinct in the male _Oreas derbyanus_ than in the female;—when we\r\nsee a similar difference between the sexes of the curiously-ornamented\r\n_Tragelaphus scriptus_ (fig. 68),—we may conclude that these colours\r\nand various marks have been at least intensified through sexual\r\nselection. It is inconceivable that such colours and marks can be of any\r\ndirect or ordinary service to these animals; and as they have almost\r\ncertainly been intensified through sexual selection, it is probable that\r\nthey were originally gained through this same process, and then\r\npartially transferred to the females. If this view be admitted, there\r\ncan be little doubt that the equally singular colours and marks of many\r\nother antelopes, though common to both sexes, have been gained and\r\ntransmitted in a like manner. Both sexes, for instance, of the Koodoo\r\n(_Strepsiceros Kudu_, fig. 62) have narrow white vertical lines on their\r\nhinder flanks, and an elegant angular white mark on their foreheads.\r\nBoth sexes in the genus Damalis are very oddly coloured; in _D. pygarga_\r\nthe back and neck are purplish-red, shading on the flanks into black,\r\nand abruptly separated from the white belly and a large white space on\r\nthe buttocks; the head is still more oddly coloured, a large oblong\r\nwhite mask, narrowly-edged with black, covers the face up to the eyes\r\n(fig. 69); there are three white stripes on the forehead, and the ears\r\nare marked with white. The fawns of this species are of a uniform pale\r\nyellowish-brown. In _Damalis albifrons_ the colouring of the head\r\ndiffers from that in the last species in a single white stripe replacing\r\nthe three stripes, and in the ears being almost wholly white.[368] After\r\nhaving studied to the best of my ability the sexual differences of\r\nanimals belonging to all classes, I cannot avoid the conclusion that the\r\ncuriously-arranged colours of many antelopes, though common to both\r\nsexes, are the result of sexual selection primarily applied to the male.\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion may perhaps be extended to the tiger, one of the\r\nmost beautiful animals in the world, the sexes of which cannot be\r\ndistinguished by colour, even by the dealers in wild beasts. Mr. Wallace\r\nbelieves[369] that the striped coat of the tiger “so assimilates with\r\nthe vertical stems of the bamboo, as to assist greatly in concealing him\r\nfrom his approaching prey.” But this view does not appear to me\r\nsatisfactory. We have some slight evidence that his beauty may be due to\r\nsexual selection, for in two species of Felis analogous marks and\r\ncolours are rather brighter in the male than in the female. The zebra is\r\nconspicuously striped, and stripes on the open plains of South Africa\r\ncannot afford any protection. Burchell[370] in describing a herd says,\r\n“their sleek ribs glistened in the sun, and the brightness and\r\nregularity of their striped coats presented a picture of extraordinary\r\nbeauty, in which probably they are not surpassed by any other\r\nquadruped.” Here we have no evidence of sexual selection, as throughout\r\nthe whole group of the Equidæ the sexes are identical in colour.\r\nNevertheless he who attributes the white and dark vertical stripes on\r\nthe flanks of various antelopes to sexual selection, will probably\r\nextend the same view to the Royal Tiger and beautiful Zebra.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in a former chapter that when young animals belonging to\r\nany class follow nearly the same habits of life with their parents, and\r\nyet are coloured in a different manner, it may be inferred that they\r\nhave retained the colouring of some ancient and extinct progenitor. In\r\nthe family of pigs, and in the genus Tapir, the young are marked with\r\nlongitudinal stripes, and thus differ from every existing adult species\r\nin these two groups. With many kinds of deer the young are marked with\r\nelegant white spots, of which their parents exhibit not a trace. A\r\ngraduated series can be followed from the Axis deer, both sexes of which\r\nat all ages and during all seasons are beautifully spotted (the male\r\nbeing rather more strongly coloured than the female)—to species in\r\nwhich neither the old nor the young are spotted. I will specify some of\r\nthe steps in this series. The Mantchurian deer (_Cervus Mantchuricus_)\r\nis spotted during the whole year, but the spots are much plainer, as I\r\nhave seen in the Zoological Gardens, during the summer, when the general\r\ncolour of the coat is lighter, than during the winter, when the general\r\ncolour is darker and the horns are fully developed. In the hog-deer\r\n(_Hyelaphus porcinus_) the spots are extremely conspicuous during the\r\nsummer when the coat is reddish-brown, but quite disappear during the\r\nwinter when the coat is brown.[371] In both these species the young are\r\nspotted. In the Virginian deer the young are likewise spotted, and about\r\nfive per cent. of the adult animals living in Judge Caton’s park, as I\r\nam informed by him, temporarily exhibit at the period when the red\r\nsummer coat is being replaced by the bluish winter coat, a row of spots\r\non each flank, which are always the same in number, though very\r\nvariable in distinctness. From this condition there is but a very small\r\nstep to the complete absence of spots at all seasons in the adults; and\r\nlastly, to their absence at all ages, as occurs with certain species.\r\nFrom the existence of this perfect series, and more especially from the\r\nfawns of so many species being spotted, we may conclude that the now\r\nliving members of the deer family are the descendants of some ancient\r\nspecies which, like the Axis deer, was spotted at all ages and seasons.\r\nA still more ancient progenitor probably resembled to a certain extent\r\nthe _Hyomoschus aquaticus_—for this animal is spotted, and the hornless\r\nmales have large exserted canine teeth, of which some few true deer\r\nstill retain rudiments. It offers, also, one of those interesting cases\r\nof a form linking together two groups, as it is intermediate in certain\r\nosteological characters between the pachyderms and ruminants, which were\r\nformerly thought to be quite distinct.[372]\r\n\r\nA curious difficulty here arises. If we admit that coloured spots and\r\nstripes have been acquired as ornaments, how comes it that so many\r\nexisting deer, the descendants of an aboriginally spotted animal, and\r\nall the species of pigs and tapirs, the descendants of an aboriginally\r\nstriped animal, have lost in their adult state their former ornaments? I\r\ncannot satisfactorily answer this question. We may feel nearly sure that\r\nthe spots and stripes disappeared in the progenitors of our existing\r\nspecies at or near maturity, so that they were retained by the young\r\nand, owing to the law of inheritance at corresponding ages, by the young\r\nof all succeeding generations. It may have been a great advantage to\r\nthe lion and puma from the open nature of the localities which they\r\ncommonly haunt, to have lost their stripes, and to have been thus\r\nrendered less conspicuous to their prey; and if the successive\r\nvariations, by which this end was gained, occurred rather late in life,\r\nthe young would have retained their stripes, as we know to be the case.\r\nIn regard to deer, pigs, and tapirs, Fritz Müller has suggested to me\r\nthat these animals by the removal through natural selection of their\r\nspots or stripes would have been less easily seen by their enemies; and\r\nthey would have especially required this protection, as soon as the\r\ncarnivora increased in size and number during the Tertiary periods. This\r\nmay be the true explanation, but it is rather strange that the young\r\nshould not have been equally well protected, and still more strange that\r\nwith some species the adults should have retained their spots, either\r\npartially or completely, during part of the year. We know, though we\r\ncannot explain the cause, that when the domestic ass varies and becomes\r\nreddish-brown, grey or black, the stripes on the shoulders and even on\r\nthe spine frequently disappear. Very few horses, except dun-coloured\r\nkinds, exhibit stripes on any part of their bodies, yet we have good\r\nreason to believe that the aboriginal horse was striped on the legs and\r\nspine, and probably on the shoulders.[373] Hence the disappearance of\r\nthe spots and stripes in our adult existing deer, pigs, and tapirs, may\r\nbe due to a change in the general colour of their coats; but whether\r\nthis change was effected through sexual or natural selection, or was due\r\nto the direct action of the conditions of life, or some other unknown\r\ncause, it is impossible to decide. An observation made by Mr. Sclater\r\nwell illustrates our ignorance of the laws which regulate the\r\nappearance and disappearance of stripes; the species of Asinus which\r\ninhabit the Asiatic continent are destitute of stripes, not having even\r\nthe cross shoulder-stripe, whilst those which inhabit Africa are\r\nconspicuously striped, with the partial exception of _A. tæniopus_,\r\nwhich has only the cross shoulder-stripe and generally some faint bars\r\non the legs; and this species inhabits the almost intermediate region of\r\nUpper Egypt and Abyssinia.[374]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. Head of Semnopithecus rubicundus. This and the\r\nfollowing figures (from Prof. Gervais) are given to shew the odd\r\narrangement and development of the hair on the head.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Head of Semnopithecus comatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Head of Cebus capucinus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Head of Ateles marginatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. Head of Cebus vellerosus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quadrumana._—Before we conclude, it will be advisable to add a few\r\nremarks to those already given on the ornamental characters of monkeys.\r\nIn most of the species the sexes resemble each other in colour, but in\r\nsome, as we have seen, the males differ from the females, especially in\r\nthe colour of the naked parts of the skin, in the development of the\r\nbeard, whiskers, and mane. Many species are coloured either in so\r\nextraordinary or beautiful a manner, and are furnished with such curious\r\nand elegant crests of hair, that we can hardly avoid looking at these\r\ncharacters as having been gained for the sake of ornament. The\r\naccompanying figures (figs. 70 to 74) serve to shew the arrangement of\r\nthe hair on the face and head in several species. It is scarcely\r\nconceivable that these crests of hair and the strongly-contrasted\r\ncolours of the fur and skin can be the result of mere variability\r\nwithout the aid of selection; and it is inconceivable that they can be\r\nof any ordinary use to these animals. If so, they have probably been\r\ngained through sexual selection, though transmitted equally, or almost\r\nequally, to both sexes. With many of the Quadrumana, we have additional\r\nevidence of the action of sexual selection in the greater size and\r\nstrength of the males, and in the greater development of their canine\r\nteeth, in comparison with the females.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the strange manner in which both sexes of some species\r\nare coloured, and of the beauty of others, a few instances will suffice.\r\nThe face of the _Cercopithecus petaurista_ (fig. 75) is black, the\r\nwhiskers and beard being white, with a defined, round, white spot on the\r\nnose, covered with short white hair, which gives to the animal an almost\r\nludicrous aspect. The _Semnopithecus frontatus_ likewise, has a blackish\r\nface with a long black beard, and a large naked spot on the forehead of\r\na bluish-white colour. The face of _Macacus lasiotus_ is dirty\r\nflesh-coloured, with a defined red spot on each cheek. The appearance of\r\n_Cercocebus æthiops_ is grotesque, with its black face, white whiskers\r\nand collar, chesnut head, and a large naked white spot over each eyelid.\r\nIn very many species, the beard, whiskers, and crests of hair round the\r\nface are of a different colour from the rest of the head, and when\r\ndifferent, are always of a lighter tint,[375] being often pure white,\r\nsometimes bright yellow, or reddish. The whole face of the South\r\nAmerican _Brachyurus calvus_ is of a “glowing scarlet hue;” but this\r\ncolour does not appear until the animal is nearly mature.[376] The\r\nnaked skin of the face differs wonderfully in colour in the various\r\nspecies. It is often brown or flesh-colour, with parts perfectly white,\r\nand often as black as that of the most sooty negro. In the Brachyurus\r\nthe scarlet tint is brighter than that of the most blushing Caucasian\r\ndamsel. It is sometimes more distinctly orange than in any Mongolian,\r\nand in several species it is blue, passing into violet or grey. In all\r\nthe species known to Mr. Bartlett, in which the adults of both sexes\r\nhave strongly-coloured faces, the colours are dull or absent during\r\nearly youth. This likewise holds good with the Mandrill and Rhesus, in\r\nwhich the face and the posterior parts of the body are brilliantly\r\ncoloured in one sex alone. In these latter cases we have every reason to\r\nbelieve that the colours were acquired through sexual selection; and we\r\nare naturally led to extend the same view to the foregoing species,\r\nthough both sexes when adult have their faces coloured in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 75. Cercopithecus petaurista (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nAlthough, according to our taste, many kinds of monkeys are far from\r\nbeautiful, other species are universally admired for their elegant\r\nappearance and bright colours. The _Semnopithecus nemæus_, though\r\npeculiarly coloured, is described as extremely pretty; the orange-tinted\r\nface is surrounded by long whiskers of glossy whiteness, with a line of\r\nchesnut-red over the eyebrows; the fur on the back is of a delicate\r\ngrey, with a square patch on the loins, the tail and the fore-arms all\r\nof a pure white; a gorget of chesnut surmounts the chest; the hind\r\nthighs are black, with the legs chesnut-red. I will mention only two\r\nother monkeys on account of their beauty; and I have selected these as\r\nthey present slight sexual differences in colour, which renders it in\r\nsome degree probable that both sexes owe their elegant appearance to\r\nsexual selection. In the moustache-monkey (_Cercopithecus cephus_) the\r\ngeneral colour of the fur is mottled-greenish, with the throat white; in\r\nthe male the end of the tail is chesnut; but the face is the most\r\nornamented part, the skin being chiefly bluish-grey, shading into a\r\nblackish tint beneath the eyes, with the upper lip of a delicate blue,\r\nclothed on the lower edge with a thin black moustache; the whiskers are\r\norange-coloured, with the upper part black, forming a band which extends\r\nbackwards to the ears, the latter being clothed with whitish hairs. In\r\nthe Zoological Society’s Gardens I have often overheard visitors\r\nadmiring the beauty of another monkey, deservedly called _Cercopithecus\r\nDiana_ (fig. 76); the general colour of the fur is grey; the chest and\r\ninner surface of the forelegs are white; a large triangular defined\r\nspace on the hinder part of the back is rich chesnut; in the male the\r\ninner sides of the thighs and the abdomen are delicate fawn-coloured,\r\nand the top of the head is black; the face and ears are intensely black,\r\nfinely contrasted with a white transverse crest over the eyebrows and\r\nwith a long white peaked beard, of which the basal portion is\r\nblack.[377]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. Cercopithecus Diana (from Brehm).]\r\n\r\nIn these and many other monkeys, the beauty and singular arrangement of\r\ntheir colours, and still more the diversified and elegant arrangement of\r\nthe crests and tufts of hair on their heads, force the conviction on my\r\nmind that these characters have been acquired through sexual selection\r\nexclusively as ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary._—The law of battle for the possession of the female appears\r\nto prevail throughout the whole great class of mammals. Most naturalists\r\nwill admit that the greater size, strength, courage, and pugnacity of\r\nthe male, his special weapons of offence, as well as his special means\r\nof defence, have all been acquired or modified through that form of\r\nselection which I have called sexual selection. This does not depend on\r\nany superiority in the general struggle for life, but on certain\r\nindividuals of one sex, generally the male sex, having been successful\r\nin conquering other males, and on their having left a larger number of\r\noffspring to inherit their superiority, than the less successful males.\r\n\r\nThere is another and more peaceful kind of contest, in which the males\r\nendeavour to excite or allure the females by various charms. This may be\r\neffected by the powerful odours emitted by the males during the\r\nbreeding-season; the odoriferous glands having been acquired through\r\nsexual selection. Whether the same view can be extended to the voice is\r\ndoubtful, for the vocal organs of the males may have been strengthened\r\nby use during maturity, under the powerful excitements of love,\r\njealousy, or rage, and transmitted to the same sex. Various crests,\r\ntufts, and mantles of hair, which are either confined to the male, or\r\nare more developed in this sex than in the females, seem in most cases\r\nto be merely ornamental, though they sometimes serve as a defence\r\nagainst rival males. There is even reason to suspect that the branching\r\nhorns of stags, and the elegant horns of certain antelopes, though\r\nproperly serving as weapons of offence or of defence, have been partly\r\nmodified for the sake of ornament.\r\n\r\nWhen the male differs in colour from the female he generally exhibits\r\ndarker and more strongly-contrasted tints. We do not in this class meet\r\nwith the splendid red, blue, yellow, and green colours, so common with\r\nmale birds and many other animals. The naked parts, however, of certain\r\nQuadrumana must be excepted; for such parts, often oddly situated, are\r\ncoloured in some species in the most brilliant manner. The colours of\r\nthe male in other cases may be due to simple variation, without the aid\r\nof selection. But when the colours are diversified and strongly\r\npronounced, when they are not developed until near maturity, and when\r\nthey are lost after emasculation, we can hardly avoid the conclusion\r\nthat they have been acquired through sexual selection for the sake of\r\nornament, and have been transmitted exclusively, or almost exclusively,\r\nto the same sex. When both sexes are coloured in the same manner, and\r\nthe colours are conspicuous or curiously arranged, without being of the\r\nleast apparent use as a protection, and especially when they are\r\nassociated with various other ornamental appendages, we are led by\r\nanalogy to the same conclusion, namely, that they have been acquired\r\nthrough sexual selection, although transmitted to both sexes. That\r\nconspicuous and diversified colours, whether confined to the males or\r\ncommon to both sexes, are as a general rule associated in the same\r\ngroups and subgroups with other secondary sexual characters, serving\r\nfor war or for ornament, will be found to hold good if we look back to\r\nthe various cases given in this and the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe law of the equal transmission of characters to both sexes, as far as\r\ncolour and other ornaments are concerned, has prevailed far more\r\nextensively with mammals than with birds; but in regard to weapons, such\r\nas horns and tusks, these have often been transmitted either\r\nexclusively, or in a much higher degree to the males than to the\r\nfemales. This is a surprising circumstance, for as the males generally\r\nuse their weapons as a defence against enemies of all kinds, these\r\nweapons would have been of service to the female. Their absence in this\r\nsex can be accounted for, as far as we can see, only by the form of\r\ninheritance which has prevailed. Finally with quadrupeds the contest\r\nbetween the individuals of the same sex, whether peaceful or bloody, has\r\nwith the rarest exceptions been confined to the males; so that these\r\nhave been modified through sexual selection, either for fighting with\r\neach other or for alluring the opposite sex, far more commonly than the\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Differences between man and woman—Causes of such differences\r\n   and of certain characters common to both sexes—Law of\r\n   battle—Differences in mental powers—and voice—On the\r\n   influence of beauty in determining the marriages of\r\n   mankind—Attention paid by savages to ornaments—Their ideas\r\n   of beauty in woman—The tendency to exaggerate each natural\r\n   peculiarity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith mankind the differences between the sexes are greater than in most\r\nspecies of Quadrumana, but not so great as in some, for instance, the\r\nmandrill. Man on an average is considerably taller, heavier, and\r\nstronger than woman, with squarer shoulders and more plainly-pronounced\r\nmuscles. Owing to the relation which exists between muscular development\r\nand the projection of the brows,[378] the superciliary ridge is\r\ngenerally more strongly marked in man than in woman. His body, and\r\nespecially his face, is more hairy, and his voice has a different and\r\nmore powerful tone. In certain tribes the women are said, whether truly\r\nI know not, to differ slightly in tint from the men; and with Europeans,\r\nthe women are perhaps the more brightly coloured of the two, as may be\r\nseen when both sexes have been equally exposed to the weather.\r\n\r\nMan is more courageous, pugnacious, and energetic than woman, and has a\r\nmore inventive genius. His brain is absolutely larger, but whether\r\nrelatively to the larger size of his body, in comparison with that of\r\nwoman, has not, I believe been fully ascertained. In woman the face is\r\nrounder; the jaws and the base of the skull smaller; the outlines of her\r\nbody rounder, in parts more prominent; and her pelvis is broader than in\r\nman;[379] but this latter character may perhaps be considered rather as\r\na primary than a secondary sexual character. She comes to maturity at an\r\nearlier age than man.\r\n\r\nAs with animals of all classes, so with man, the distinctive characters\r\nof the male sex are not fully developed until he is nearly mature; and\r\nif emasculated they never appear. The beard, for instance, is a\r\nsecondary sexual character, and male children are beardless, though at\r\nan early age they have abundant hair on their heads. It is probably due\r\nto the rather late appearance in life of the successive variations, by\r\nwhich man acquired his masculine characters, that they are transmitted\r\nto the male sex alone. Male and female children resemble each other\r\nclosely, like the young of so many other animals in which the adult\r\nsexes differ; they likewise resemble the mature female much more\r\nclosely, than the mature male. The female, however, ultimately assumes\r\ncertain distinctive characters, and in the formation of her skull, is\r\nsaid to be intermediate between the child and the man.[380] Again, as\r\nthe young of closely allied though distinct species do not differ nearly\r\nso much from each other as do the adults, so it is with the children of\r\nthe different races of man. Some have even maintained that\r\nrace-differences cannot be detected in the infantile skull.[381] In\r\nregard to colour, the newborn negro child is reddish nut-brown, which\r\nsoon becomes slaty-grey; the black colour being fully developed within a\r\nyear in the Sudan, but not until three years in Egypt. The eyes of the\r\nnegro are at first blue, and the hair chesnut-brown rather than black,\r\nbeing curled only at the ends. The children of the Australians\r\nimmediately after birth are yellowish-brown, and become dark at a later\r\nage. Those of the Guaranys of Paraguay are whitish-yellow, but they\r\nacquire in the course of a few weeks the yellowish-brown tint of their\r\nparents. Similar observations have been made in other parts of\r\nAmerica.[382]\r\n\r\nI have specified the foregoing familiar differences between the male and\r\nfemale sex in mankind, because they are curiously the same as in the\r\nQuadrumana. With these animals the female is mature at an earlier age\r\nthan the male; at least this is certainly the case with the _Cebus\r\nazaræ_.[383] With most of the species the males are larger and much\r\nstronger than the females, of which fact the gorilla offers a well-known\r\ninstance. Even in so trifling a character as the greater prominence of\r\nthe superciliary ridge, the males of certain monkeys differ from the\r\nfemales,[384] and agree in this respect with mankind. In the gorilla and\r\ncertain other monkeys, the cranium of the adult male presents a\r\nstrongly-marked sagittal crest, which is absent in the female; and Ecker\r\nfound a trace of a similar difference between the two sexes in the\r\nAustralians.[385] With monkeys when there is any difference in the\r\nvoice, that of the male is the more powerful. We have seen that certain\r\nmale monkeys, have a well-developed beard, which is quite deficient, or\r\nmuch less developed in the female. No instance is known of the beard,\r\nwhiskers, or moustache being larger in a female than in the male monkey.\r\nEven in the colour of the beard there is a curious parallelism between\r\nman and the Quadrumana, for when in man the beard differs in colour from\r\nthe hair of the head, as is often the case, it is, I believe, invariably\r\nof a lighter tint, being often reddish. I have observed this fact in\r\nEngland, and Dr. Hooker, who attended to this little point for me in\r\nRussia, found no exception to the rule. In Calcutta, Mr. J. Scott, of\r\nthe Botanic Gardens, was so kind as to observe with care the many races\r\nof men to be seen there, as well as in some other parts of India,\r\nnamely, two races in Sikhim, the Bhoteas, Hindoos, Burmese, and Chinese.\r\nAlthough most of these races have very little hair on the face, yet he\r\nalways found that when there was any difference in colour between the\r\nhair of the head and the beard, the latter was invariably of a lighter\r\ntint. Now with monkeys, as has already been stated, the beard frequently\r\ndiffers in a striking manner in colour from the hair of the head, and in\r\nsuch cases it is invariably of a lighter hue, being often pure white,\r\nsometimes yellow or reddish.[386]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the general hairyness of the body, the women in all races\r\nare less hairy than the men, and in some few Quadrumana the under side\r\nof the body of the female is less hairy than that of the male.[387]\r\nLastly, male monkeys, like men, are bolder and fiercer than the females.\r\nThey lead the troop, and when there is danger, come to the front. We\r\nthus see how close is the parallelism between the sexual differences of\r\nman and the Quadrumana. With some few species, however, as with certain\r\nbaboons, the gorilla and orang, there is a considerably greater\r\ndifference between the sexes, in the size of the canine teeth, in the\r\ndevelopment and colour of the hair, and especially in the colour of the\r\nnaked parts of the skin, than in the case of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe secondary sexual characters of man are all highly variable, even\r\nwithin the limits of the same race or sub-species; and they differ much\r\nin the several races. These two rules generally hold good throughout the\r\nanimal kingdom. In the excellent observations made on board the\r\n_Novara_,[388] the male Australians were found to exceed the females by\r\nonly 65 millim. in height, whilst with the Javanese the average excess\r\nwas 218 millim., so that in this latter race the difference in height\r\nbetween the sexes is more than thrice as great as with the Australians.\r\nThe numerous measurements of various other races, with respect to\r\nstature, the circumference of the neck and chest, and the length of the\r\nback-bone and arms, which were carefully made, nearly all shewed that\r\nthe males differed much more from each other than did the females. This\r\nfact indicates that, as far as these characters are concerned, it is the\r\nmale which has been chiefly modified, since the races diverged from\r\ntheir common and primeval source.\r\n\r\nThe development of the beard and the hairiness of the body differ\r\nremarkably in the men belonging to distinct races, and even to different\r\nfamilies in the same race. We Europeans see this amongst ourselves. In\r\nthe island of St. Kilda, according to Martin,[389] the men do not\r\nacquire beards, which are very thin, until the age of thirty or upwards.\r\nOn the Europæo-Asiatic continent, beards prevail until we pass beyond\r\nIndia, though with the natives of Ceylon they are frequently absent, as\r\nwas noticed in ancient times by Diodorus.[390] Beyond India beards\r\ndisappear, as with the Siamese, Malays, Kalmucks, Chinese, and Japanese;\r\nnevertheless the Ainos,[391] who inhabit the northernmost islands of the\r\nJapan archipelago, are the most hairy men in the world. With negroes the\r\nbeard is scanty or absent, and they have no whiskers; in both sexes the\r\nbody is almost destitute of fine down.[392] On the other hand, the\r\nPapuans of the Malay archipelago, who are nearly as black as negroes,\r\npossess well-developed beards.[393] In the Pacific Ocean the inhabitants\r\nof the Fiji archipelago have large bushy beards, whilst those of the\r\nnot-distant archipelagoes of Tonga and Samoa are beardless; but these\r\nmen belong to distinct races. In the Ellice group all the inhabitants\r\nbelong to the same race; yet on one island alone, namely Nunemaya, “the\r\nmen have splendid beards;” whilst on the other islands “they have, as a\r\nrule, a dozen straggling hairs for a beard.”[394]\r\n\r\nThroughout the great American continent the men may be said to be\r\nbeardless; but in almost all the tribes a few short hairs are apt to\r\nappear on the face, especially during old age. With the tribes of North\r\nAmerica, Catlin estimates that eighteen out of twenty men are completely\r\ndestitute by nature of a beard; but occasionally there may be seen a\r\nman, who has neglected to pluck out the hairs at puberty, with a soft\r\nbeard an inch or two in length. The Guaranys of Paraguay differ from all\r\nthe surrounding tribes in having a small beard, and even some hair on\r\nthe body, but no whiskers.[395] I am informed by Mr. D. Forbes, who\r\nparticularly attended to this subject, that the Aymaras and Quechuas of\r\nthe Cordillera are remarkably hairless, yet in old age a few straggling\r\nhairs occasionally appear on the chin. The men of these two tribes have\r\nvery little hair on the various parts of the body where hair grows\r\nabundantly in Europeans, and the women have none on the corresponding\r\nparts. The hair on the head, however, attains an extraordinary length in\r\nboth sexes, often reaching almost to the ground; and this is likewise\r\nthe case with some of the N. American tribes. In the amount of hair, and\r\nin the general shape of the body, the sexes of the American aborigines\r\ndo not differ from each other so much as with most other races of\r\nmankind.[396] This fact is analogous with what occurs with some allied\r\nmonkeys; thus the sexes of the chimpanzee are not as different as those\r\nof the gorilla or orang.[397]\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapters we have seen that with mammals, birds, fishes,\r\ninsects, &c., many characters, which there is every reason to believe\r\nwere primarily gained through sexual selection by one sex alone, have\r\nbeen transferred to both sexes. As this same form of transmission has\r\napparently prevailed to a large extent with mankind, it will save much\r\nuseless repetition if we consider the characters peculiar to the male\r\nsex together with certain other characters common to both sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Law of Battle._—With barbarous nations, for instance with the\r\nAustralians, the women are the constant cause of war both between the\r\nindividuals of the same tribe and between distinct tribes. So no doubt\r\nit was in ancient times; “nam fuit ante Helenam mulier teterrima belli\r\ncausa.” With the North American Indians, the contest is reduced to a\r\nsystem. That excellent observer, Hearne,[398] says:—“It has ever been\r\nthe custom among these people for the men to wrestle for any woman to\r\nwhom they are attached; and, of course, the strongest party always\r\ncarries off the prize. A weak man, unless he be a good hunter, and\r\nwell-beloved, is seldom permitted to keep a wife that a stronger man\r\nthinks worth his notice. This custom prevails throughout all the tribes,\r\nand causes a great spirit of emulation among their youth, who are upon\r\nall occasions, from their childhood, trying their strength and skill in\r\nwrestling.” With the Guanas of South America, Azara states that the men\r\nrarely marry till twenty or more years old, as before that age they\r\ncannot conquer their rivals.\r\n\r\nOther similar facts could be given; but even if we had no evidence on\r\nthis head, we might feel almost sure, from the analogy of the higher\r\nQuadrumana,[399] that the law of battle had prevailed with man during\r\nthe early stages of his development. The occasional appearance at the\r\npresent day of canine teeth which project above the others, with traces\r\nof a diastema or open space for the reception of the opposite canines,\r\nis in all probability a case of reversion to a former state, when the\r\nprogenitors of man were provided with these weapons, like so many\r\nexisting male Quadrumana. It was remarked in a former chapter that as\r\nman gradually became erect, and continually used his hands and arms for\r\nfighting with sticks and stones, as well as for the other purposes of\r\nlife, he would have used his jaws and teeth less and less. The jaws,\r\ntogether with their muscles, would then have become reduced through\r\ndisuse, as would the teeth through the not well understood principles of\r\ncorrelation and the economy of growth; for we everywhere see that parts\r\nwhich are no longer of service are reduced in size. By such steps the\r\noriginal inequality between the jaws and teeth in the two sexes of\r\nmankind would ultimately have been quite obliterated. The case is almost\r\nparallel with that of many male Ruminants, in which the canine teeth\r\nhave been reduced to mere rudiments, or have disappeared, apparently in\r\nconsequence of the development of horns. As the prodigious difference\r\nbetween the skulls of the two sexes in the Gorilla and Orang, stands in\r\nclose relation with the development of the immense canine teeth in the\r\nmales, we may infer that the reduction of the jaws and teeth in the\r\nearly male progenitors of man led to a most striking and favourable\r\nchange in his appearance.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the greater size and strength of man, in\r\ncomparison with woman, together with his broader shoulders, more\r\ndeveloped muscles, rugged outline of body, his greater courage and\r\npugnacity, are all due in chief part to inheritance from some early male\r\nprogenitor, who, like the existing anthropoid apes, was thus\r\ncharacterised. These characters will, however, have been preserved or\r\neven augmented during the long ages whilst man was still in a barbarous\r\ncondition, by the strongest and boldest men having succeeded best in the\r\ngeneral struggle for life, as well as in securing wives, and thus having\r\nleft a large number of offspring. It is not probable that the greater\r\nstrength of man was primarily acquired through the inherited effects of\r\nhis having worked harder than woman for his own subsistence and that of\r\nhis family; for the women in all barbarous nations are compelled to\r\nwork at least as hard as the men. With civilised people the arbitrament\r\nof battle for the possession of the women has long ceased; on the other\r\nhand, the men, as a general rule, have to work harder than the women for\r\ntheir mutual subsistence; and thus their greater strength will have been\r\nkept up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difference in the Mental Powers of the two Sexes._—With respect to\r\ndifferences of this nature between man and woman, it is probable that\r\nsexual selection has played a very important part. I am aware that some\r\nwriters doubt whether there is any inherent difference; but this is at\r\nleast probable from the analogy of the lower animals which present other\r\nsecondary sexual characters. No one will dispute that the bull differs\r\nin disposition from the cow, the wild-boar from the sow, the stallion\r\nfrom the mare, and, as is well known to the keepers of menageries, the\r\nmales of the larger apes from the females. Woman seems to differ from\r\nman in mental disposition, chiefly in her greater tenderness and less\r\nselfishness; and this holds good even with savages, as shewn by a\r\nwell-known passage in Mungo Park’s Travels, and by statements made by\r\nmany other travellers. Woman, owing to her maternal instincts, displays\r\nthese qualities towards her infants in an eminent degree; therefore it\r\nis likely that she should often extend them towards her\r\nfellow-creatures. Man is the rival of other men; he delights in\r\ncompetition, and this leads to ambition which passes too easily into\r\nselfishness. These latter qualities seem to be his natural and\r\nunfortunate birthright. It is generally admitted that with woman the\r\npowers of intuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of imitation, are\r\nmore strongly marked than in man; but some, at least, of these\r\nfaculties are characteristic of the lower races, and therefore of a past\r\nand lower state of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is\r\nshewn by man attaining to a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up,\r\nthan woman can attain—whether requiring deep thought, reason, or\r\nimagination, or merely the use of the senses and hands. If two lists\r\nwere made of the most eminent men and women in poetry, painting,\r\nsculpture, music,—comprising composition and performance, history,\r\nscience, and philosophy, with half-a-dozen names under each subject, the\r\ntwo lists would not bear comparison. We may also infer, from the law of\r\nthe deviation of averages, so well illustrated by Mr. Galton, in his\r\nwork on ‘Hereditary Genius,’ that if men are capable of decided eminence\r\nover women in many subjects, the average standard of mental power in man\r\nmust be above that of woman.\r\n\r\nThe half-human male progenitors of man, and men in a savage state, have\r\nstruggled together during many generations for the possession of the\r\nfemales. But mere bodily strength and size would do little for victory,\r\nunless associated with courage, perseverance, and determined energy.\r\nWith social animals, the young males have to pass through many a contest\r\nbefore they win a female, and the older males have to retain their\r\nfemales by renewed battles. They have, also, in the case of man, to\r\ndefend their females, as well as their young, from enemies of all kinds,\r\nand to hunt for their joint subsistence. But to avoid enemies, or to\r\nattack them with success, to capture wild animals, and to invent and\r\nfashion weapons, requires the aid of the higher mental faculties,\r\nnamely, observation, reason, invention, or imagination. These various\r\nfaculties will thus have been continually put to the test, and selected\r\nduring manhood; they will, moreover, have been strengthened by use\r\nduring this same period of life. Consequently, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple often alluded to, we might expect that they would at least\r\ntend to be transmitted chiefly to the male offspring at the\r\ncorresponding period of manhood.\r\n\r\nNow, when two men are put into competition, or a man with a woman, who\r\npossess every mental quality in the same perfection, with the exception\r\nthat the one has higher energy, perseverance, and courage, this one will\r\ngenerally become more eminent, whatever the object may be, and will gain\r\nthe victory.[400] He may be said to possess genius—for genius has been\r\ndeclared by a great authority to be patience; and patience, in this\r\nsense, means unflinching, undaunted perseverance. But this view of\r\ngenius is perhaps deficient; for without the higher powers of the\r\nimagination and reason, no eminent success in many subjects can be\r\ngained. But these latter as well as the former faculties will have been\r\ndeveloped in man, partly through sexual selection,—that is, through the\r\ncontest of rival males, and partly through natural selection,—that is,\r\nfrom success in the general struggle for life; and as in both cases the\r\nstruggle will have been during maturity, the characters thus gained will\r\nhave been transmitted more fully to the male than to the female\r\noffspring. Thus man has ultimately become superior to woman. It is,\r\nindeed, fortunate that the law of the equal transmission of characters\r\nto both sexes has commonly prevailed throughout the whole class of\r\nmammals; otherwise it is probable that man would have become as\r\nsuperior in mental endowment to woman, as the peacock is in ornamental\r\nplumage to the peahen.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the tendency in characters acquired at a\r\nlate period of life by either sex, to be transmitted to the same sex at\r\nthe same age, and of characters acquired at an early age to be\r\ntransmitted to both sexes, are rules which, though general, do not\r\nalways hold good. If they always held good, we might conclude (but I am\r\nhere wandering beyond my proper bounds) that the inherited effects of\r\nthe early education of boys and girls would be transmitted equally to\r\nboth sexes; so that the present inequality between the sexes in mental\r\npower could not be effaced by a similar course of early training; nor\r\ncan it have been caused by their dissimilar early training. In order\r\nthat woman should reach the same standard as man, she ought, when nearly\r\nadult, to be trained to energy and perseverance, and to have her reason\r\nand imagination exercised to the highest point; and then she would\r\nprobably transmit these qualities chiefly to her adult daughters. The\r\nwhole body of women, however, could not be thus raised, unless during\r\nmany generations the women who excelled in the above robust virtues were\r\nmarried, and produced offspring in larger numbers than other women. As\r\nbefore remarked with respect to bodily strength, although men do not now\r\nfight for the sake of obtaining wives, and this form of selection has\r\npassed away, yet they generally have to undergo, during manhood, a\r\nsevere struggle in order to maintain themselves and their families; and\r\nthis will tend to keep up or even increase their mental powers, and, as\r\na consequence, the present inequality between the sexes.[401]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Voice and Musical Powers._—In some species of Quadrumana there is a\r\ngreat difference between the adult sexes, in the power of the voice and\r\nin the development of the vocal organs; and man appears to have\r\ninherited this difference from his early progenitors. His vocal cords\r\nare about one-third longer than in woman, or than in boys; and\r\nemasculation produces the same effect on him as on the lower animals,\r\nfor it “arrests that prominent growth of the thyroid, &c., which\r\naccompanies the elongation of the cords.”[402] With respect to the cause\r\nof this difference between the sexes, I have nothing to add to the\r\nremarks made in the last chapter on the probable effects of the\r\nlong-continued use of the vocal organs by the male under the excitement\r\nof love, rage, and jealousy. According to Sir Duncan Gibb,[403] the\r\nvoice differs in the different races of mankind; and with the natives of\r\nTartary, China, &c., the voice of the male is said not to differ so much\r\nfrom that of the female, as in most other races.\r\n\r\nThe capacity and love for singing or music, though not a sexual\r\ncharacter in man, must not here be passed over. Although the sounds\r\nemitted by animals of all kinds serve many purposes, a strong case can\r\nbe made out, that the vocal organs were primarily used and perfected in\r\nrelation to the propagation of the species. Insects and some few spiders\r\nare the lowest animals which voluntarily produce any sound; and this is\r\ngenerally effected by the aid of beautifully constructed stridulating\r\norgans, which are often confined to the males alone. The sounds thus\r\nproduced consist, I believe in all cases, of the same note, repeated\r\nrhythmically;[404] and this is sometimes pleasing even to the ears of\r\nman. Their chief, and in some cases exclusive use appears to be either\r\nto call or to charm the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nThe sounds produced by fishes are said in some cases to be made only by\r\nthe males during the breeding season. All the air-breathing Vertebrata\r\nnecessarily possess an apparatus for inhaling and expelling air, with a\r\npipe capable of being closed at one end. Hence when the primeval members\r\nof this class were strongly excited and their muscles violently\r\ncontracted, purposeless sounds would almost certainly have been\r\nproduced; and these, if they proved in any way serviceable, might\r\nreadily have been modified or intensified by the preservation of\r\nproperly adapted variations. The Amphibians are the lowest Vertebrates\r\nwhich breathe air; and many of these animals, namely, frogs and toads,\r\npossess vocal organs, which are incessantly used during the\r\nbreeding-season, and which are often more highly developed in the male\r\nthan in the female. The male alone of the tortoise utters a noise, and\r\nthis only during the season of love. Male alligators roar or bellow\r\nduring the same season. Every one knows how largely birds use their\r\nvocal organs as a means of courtship; and some species likewise perform\r\nwhat may be called instrumental music.\r\n\r\nIn the class of Mammals, with which we are here more particularly\r\nconcerned, the males of almost all the species use their voices during\r\nthe breeding-season much more than at any other time; and some are\r\nabsolutely mute excepting at this season. Both sexes of other species,\r\nor the females alone, use their voices as a love-call. Considering these\r\nfacts, and that the vocal organs of some quadrupeds are much more\r\nlargely developed in the male than in the female, either permanently or\r\ntemporarily during the breeding season; and considering that in most of\r\nthe lower classes the sounds produced by the males, serve not only to\r\ncall but to excite or allure the female, it is a surprising fact that we\r\nhave not as yet any good evidence that these organs are used by male\r\nmammals to charm the females. The American _Mycetes caraya_ perhaps\r\nforms an exception, as does more probably one of those apes which come\r\nnearer to man, namely, the _Hylobates agilis_. This gibbon has an\r\nextremely loud but musical voice. Mr. Waterhouse states,[405] “It\r\nappeared to me that in ascending and descending the scale, the intervals\r\nwere always exactly half-tones; and I am sure that the highest note was\r\nthe exact octave to the lowest. The quality of the notes is very\r\nmusical; and I do not doubt that a good violinist would be able to give\r\na correct idea of the gibbon’s composition, excepting as regards its\r\nloudness.” Mr. Waterhouse then gives the notes. Professor Owen, who is\r\nlikewise a musician, confirms the foregoing statement, and remarks that\r\nthis gibbon “alone of brute mammals may be said to sing.” It appears to\r\nbe much excited after its performance. Unfortunately its habits have\r\nnever been closely observed in a state of nature; but from the analogy\r\nof almost all other animals, it is highly probable that it utters its\r\nmusical notes especially during the season of courtship.\r\n\r\nThe perception, if not the enjoyment, of musical cadences and of rhythm\r\nis probably common to all animals, and no doubt depends on the common\r\nphysiological nature of their nervous systems. Even Crustaceans, which\r\nare not capable of producing any voluntary sound, possess certain\r\nauditory hairs, which have been seen to vibrate when the proper musical\r\nnotes are struck.[406] It is well known that some dogs howl when hearing\r\nparticular tones. Seals apparently appreciate music, and their fondness\r\nfor it “was well known to the ancients, and is often taken advantage of\r\nby the hunters at the present day.”[407] With all those animals, namely\r\ninsects, amphibians, and birds, the males of which during the season of\r\ncourtship incessantly produce musical notes or mere rhythmical sounds,\r\nwe must believe that the females are able to appreciate them, and are\r\nthus excited or charmed; otherwise the incessant efforts of the males\r\nand the complex structures often possessed exclusively by them would be\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nWith man song is generally admitted to be the basis or origin of\r\ninstrumental music. As neither the enjoyment nor the capacity of\r\nproducing musical notes are faculties of the least direct use to man in\r\nreference to his ordinary habits of life, they must be ranked amongst\r\nthe most mysterious with which he is endowed. They are present, though\r\nin a very rude and as it appears almost latent condition, in men of all\r\nraces, even the most savage; but so different is the taste of the\r\ndifferent races, that our music gives not the least pleasure to savages,\r\nand their music is to us hideous and unmeaning. Dr. Seemann, in some\r\ninteresting remarks on this subject,[408] “doubts whether even amongst\r\nthe nations of Western Europe, intimately connected as they are by close\r\nand frequent intercourse, the music of the one is interpreted in the\r\nsame sense by the others. By travelling eastwards we find that there is\r\ncertainly a different language of music. Songs of joy and\r\ndance-accompaniments are no longer, as with us, in the major keys, but\r\nalways in the minor.” Whether or not the half-human progenitors of man\r\npossessed, like the before-mentioned gibbon, the capacity of producing,\r\nand no doubt of appreciating, musical notes, we have every reason to\r\nbelieve that man possessed these faculties at a very remote period, for\r\nsinging and music are extremely ancient arts. Poetry, which may be\r\nconsidered as the offspring of song, is likewise so ancient that many\r\npersons have felt astonishment that it should have arisen during the\r\nearliest ages of which we have any record.\r\n\r\nThe musical faculties, which are not wholly deficient in any race, are\r\ncapable of prompt and high development, as we see with Hottentots and\r\nNegroes, who have readily become excellent musicians, although they do\r\nnot practise in their native countries anything that we should esteem as\r\nmusic. But there is nothing anomalous in this circumstance: some species\r\nof birds which never naturally sing, can without much difficulty be\r\ntaught to perform; thus the house-sparrow has learnt the song of a\r\nlinnet. As these two species are closely allied, and belong to the order\r\nof Insessores, which includes nearly all the singing-birds in the world,\r\nit is quite possible or probable that a progenitor of the sparrow may\r\nhave been a songster. It is a much more remarkable fact that parrots,\r\nwhich belong to a group distinct from the Insessores, and have\r\ndifferently-constructed vocal organs, can be taught not only to speak,\r\nbut to pipe or whistle tunes invented by man, so that they must have\r\nsome musical capacity. Nevertheless it would be extremely rash to assume\r\nthat parrots are descended from some ancient progenitor which was a\r\nsongster. Many analogous cases could be advanced of organs and instincts\r\noriginally adapted for one purpose, having been utilised for some quite\r\ndistinct purpose.[409] Hence the capacity for high musical development,\r\nwhich the savage races of man possess, may be due either to our\r\nsemi-human progenitors having practised some rude form of music, or\r\nsimply to their having acquired for some distinct purposes the proper\r\nvocal organs. But in this latter case we must assume that they already\r\npossessed, as in the above instance of the parrots, and as seems to\r\noccur with many animals, some sense of melody.\r\n\r\nMusic affects every emotion, but does not by itself excite in us the\r\nmore terrible emotions of horror, rage, &c. It awakens the gentler\r\nfeelings of tenderness and love, which readily pass into devotion. It\r\nlikewise stirs up in us the sensation of triumph and the glorious ardour\r\nfor war. These powerful and mingled feelings may well give rise to the\r\nsense of sublimity. We can concentrate, as Dr. Seemann observes, greater\r\nintensity of feeling in a single musical note than in pages of writing.\r\nNearly the same emotions, but much weaker and less complex, are probably\r\nfelt by birds when the male pours forth his full volume of song, in\r\nrivalry with other males, for the sake of captivating the female. Love\r\nis still the commonest theme of our own songs. As Herbert Spencer\r\nremarks, music “arouses dormant sentiments of which we had not conceived\r\nthe possibility, and do not know the meaning; or, as Richter says, tells\r\nus of things we have not seen and shall not see.”[410] Conversely, when\r\nvivid emotions are felt and expressed by the orator or even in common\r\nspeech, musical cadences and rhythm are instinctively used. Monkeys also\r\nexpress strong feelings in different tones—anger and impatience by\r\nlow,—fear and pain by high notes.[411] The sensations and ideas excited\r\nin us by music, or by the cadences of impassioned oratory, appear from\r\ntheir vagueness, yet depth, like mental reversions to the emotions and\r\nthoughts of a long-past age.\r\n\r\nAll these facts with respect to music become to a certain extent\r\nintelligible if we may assume that musical tones and rhythm were used by\r\nthe half-human progenitors of man, during the season of courtship, when\r\nanimals of all kinds are excited by the strongest passions. In this\r\ncase, from the deeply-laid principle of inherited associations, musical\r\ntones would be likely to excite in us, in a vague and indefinite manner,\r\nthe strong emotions of a long-past age. Bearing in mind that the males\r\nof some quadrumanous animals have their vocal organs much more developed\r\nthan in the females, and that one anthropomorphous species pours forth a\r\nwhole octave of musical notes and may be said to sing, the suspicion\r\ndoes not appear improbable that the progenitors of man, either the males\r\nor females, or both sexes, before they had acquired the power of\r\nexpressing their mutual love in articulate language, endeavoured to\r\ncharm each other with musical notes and rhythm. So little is known about\r\nthe use of the voice by the Quadrumana during the season of love, that\r\nwe have hardly any means of judging whether the habit of singing was\r\nfirst acquired by the male or female progenitors of mankind. Women are\r\ngenerally thought to possess sweeter voices than men, and as far as this\r\nserves as any guide we may infer that they first acquired musical powers\r\nin order to attract the other sex.[412] But if so, this must have\r\noccurred long ago, before the progenitors of man had become sufficiently\r\nhuman to treat and value their women merely as useful slaves. The\r\nimpassioned orator, bard, or musician, when with his varied tones and\r\ncadences he excites the strongest emotions in his hearers, little\r\nsuspects that he uses the same means by which, at an extremely remote\r\nperiod, his half-human ancestors aroused each other’s ardent passions,\r\nduring their mutual courtship and rivalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the influence of beauty in determining the marriages of\r\nmankind._—In civilised life man is largely, but by no means\r\nexclusively, influenced in the choice of his wife by external\r\nappearance; but we are chiefly concerned with primeval times, and our\r\nonly means of forming a judgment on this subject is to study the habits\r\nof existing semi-civilised and savage nations. If it can be shewn that\r\nthe men of different races prefer women having certain characteristics,\r\nor conversely that the women prefer certain men, we have then to enquire\r\nwhether such choice, continued during many generations, would produce\r\nany sensible effect on the race, either on one sex or both sexes; this\r\nlatter circumstance depending on the form of inheritance which prevails.\r\n\r\nIt will be well first to shew in some detail that savages pay the\r\ngreatest attention to their personal appearance.[413] That they have a\r\npassion for ornament is notorious; and an English philosopher goes so\r\nfar as to maintain that clothes were first made for ornament and not for\r\nwarmth. As Professor Waitz remarks, “however poor and miserable man is,\r\nhe finds a pleasure in adorning himself.” The extravagance of the naked\r\nIndians of South America in decorating themselves is shewn “by a man of\r\nlarge stature gaining with difficulty enough by the labour of a\r\nfortnight to procure in exchange the _chica_ necessary to paint himself\r\nred.”[414] The ancient barbarians of Europe during the Reindeer period\r\nbrought to their caves any brilliant or singular objects which they\r\nhappened to find. Savages at the present day everywhere deck themselves\r\nwith plumes, necklaces, armlets, earrings, &c. They paint themselves in\r\nthe most diversified manner. “If painted nations,” as Humboldt observes,\r\n“had been examined with the same attention as clothed nations, it would\r\nhave been perceived that the most fertile imagination and the most\r\nmutable caprice have created the fashions of painting, as well as those\r\nof garments.”\r\n\r\nIn one part of Africa the eyelids are coloured black; in another the\r\nnails are coloured yellow or purple. In many places the hair is dyed of\r\nvarious tints. In different countries the teeth are stained black, red,\r\nblue, &c., and in the Malay Archipelago it is thought shameful to have\r\nwhite teeth like those of a dog. Not one great country can be named,\r\nfrom the Polar regions in the north to New Zealand in the south, in\r\nwhich the aborigines do not tattoo themselves. This practice was\r\nfollowed by the Jews of old and by the ancient Britons. In Africa some\r\nof the natives tattoo themselves, but it is much more common to raise\r\nprotuberances by rubbing salt into incisions made in various parts of\r\nthe body; and these are considered by the inhabitants of Kordofan and\r\nDarfur “to be great personal attractions.” In the Arab countries no\r\nbeauty can be perfect until the cheeks “or temples have been\r\ngashed.”[415] In South America, as Humboldt remarks, “a mother would be\r\naccused of culpable indifference towards her children, if she did not\r\nemploy artificial means to shape the calf of the leg after the fashion\r\nof the country.” In the Old and New World the shape of the skull was\r\nformerly modified during infancy in the most extraordinary manner, as is\r\nstill the case in many places, and such deformities are considered\r\nornamental. For instance, the savages of Colombia[416] deem a much\r\nflattened head “an essential point of beauty.”\r\n\r\nThe hair is treated with especial care in various countries; it is\r\nallowed to grow to full length, so as to reach to the ground, or is\r\ncombed into “a compact frizzled mop, which is the Papuan’s pride and\r\nglory.”[417] In Northern Africa “a man requires a period of from eight\r\nto ten years to perfect his coiffure.” With other nations the head is\r\nshaved, and in parts of South America and Africa even the eyebrows are\r\neradicated. The natives of the Upper Nile knock out the four front\r\nteeth, saying that they do not wish to resemble brutes. Further south,\r\nthe Batokas knock out the two upper incisors, which, as Livingstone[418]\r\nremarks, gives the face a hideous appearance, owing to the growth of the\r\nlower jaw; but these people think the presence of the incisors most\r\nunsightly, and on beholding some Europeans, cried out, “Look at the\r\ngreat teeth!” The great chief Sebituani tried in vain to alter this\r\nfashion. In various parts of Africa and in the Malay Archipelago the\r\nnatives file the incisor teeth into points like those of a saw, or\r\npierce them with holes, into which they insert studs.\r\n\r\nAs the face with us is chiefly admired for its beauty, so with savages\r\nit is the chief seat of mutilation. In all quarters of the world the\r\nseptum, and more rarely the wings of the nose are pierced, with rings,\r\nsticks, feathers, and other ornaments inserted into the holes. The ears\r\nare everywhere pierced and similarly ornamented, and with the Botocudos\r\nand Lenguas of South America the hole is gradually so much enlarged that\r\nthe lower edge touches the shoulder. In North and South America and in\r\nAfrica either the upper or lower lip is pierced; and with the Botocudos\r\nthe hole in the lower lip is so large that a disc of wood four inches in\r\ndiameter is placed in it. Mantegazza gives a curious account of the\r\nshame felt by a South American native, and of the ridicule which he\r\nexcited, when he sold his _tembeta_,—the large coloured piece of wood\r\nwhich is passed through the hole. In central Africa the women perforate\r\nthe lower lip and wear a crystal, which, from the movement of the\r\ntongue, has “a wriggling motion indescribably ludicrous during\r\nconversation.” The wife of the chief of Latooka told Sir S. Baker[419]\r\nthat his “wife would be much improved if she would extract her four\r\nfront teeth from the lower jaw, and wear the long pointed polished\r\ncrystal in her under lip.” Further south with the Makalolo, the upper\r\nlip is perforated, and a large metal and bamboo ring, called a _pelelé_,\r\nis worn in the hole. “This caused the lip in one case to project two\r\ninches beyond the tip of the nose; and when the lady smiled the\r\ncontraction of the muscles elevated it over the eyes. ‘Why do the women\r\nwear these things?’ the venerable chief, Chinsurdi, was asked. Evidently\r\nsurprised at such a stupid question, he replied, ‘For beauty! They are\r\nthe only beautiful things women have; men have beards, women have none.\r\nWhat kind of a person would she be without the pelelé? She would not be\r\na woman at all with a mouth like a man, but no beard.’” [420]\r\n\r\nHardly any part of the body, which can be unnaturally modified, has\r\nescaped. The amount of suffering thus caused must have been wonderfully\r\ngreat, for many of the operations require several years for their\r\ncompletion, so that the idea of their necessity must be imperative. The\r\nmotives are various; the men paint their bodies to make themselves\r\nappear terrible in battle; certain mutilations are connected with\r\nreligious rites; or they mark the age of puberty, or the rank of the\r\nman, or they serve to distinguish the tribes. As with savages the same\r\nfashions prevail for long periods,[421] mutilations, from whatever cause\r\nfirst made, soon come to be valued as distinctive marks. But\r\nself-adornment, vanity, and the admiration of others, seem to be the\r\ncommonest motives. In regard to tattooing, I was told by the\r\nmissionaries in New Zealand, that when they tried to persuade some girls\r\nto give up the practice, they answered, “We must just have a few lines\r\non our lips; else when we grow old we shall be so very ugly.” With the\r\nmen of New Zealand, a most capable judge[422] says, “to have fine\r\ntattooed faces was the great ambition of the young, both to render\r\nthemselves attractive to the ladies, and conspicuous in war.” A star\r\ntattooed on the forehead and a spot on the chin are thought by the\r\nwomen in one part of Africa to be irresistible attractions.[423] In\r\nmost, but not all parts of the world, the men are more highly ornamented\r\nthan the women, and often in a different manner; sometimes, though\r\nrarely, the women are hardly at all ornamented. As the women are made by\r\nsavages to perform the greatest share of the work, and as they are not\r\nallowed to eat the best kinds of food, so it accords with the\r\ncharacteristic selfishness of man that they should not be allowed to\r\nobtain, or to use, the finest ornaments. Lastly it is a remarkable fact,\r\nas proved by the foregoing quotations, that the same fashions in\r\nmodifying the shape of the head, in ornamenting the hair, in painting,\r\ntattooing, perforating the nose, lips, or ears, in removing or filing\r\nthe teeth, &c., now prevail and have long prevailed in the most distant\r\nquarters of the world. It is extremely improbable that these practices\r\nwhich are followed by so many distinct nations are due to tradition from\r\nany common source. They rather indicate the close similarity of the mind\r\nof man, to whatever race he may belong, in the same manner as the almost\r\nuniversal habits of dancing, masquerading, and making rude pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving made these preliminary remarks on the admiration felt by savages\r\nfor various ornaments, and for deformities most unsightly in our eyes,\r\nlet us see how far the men are attracted by the appearance of their\r\nwomen, and what are their ideas of beauty. As I have heard it maintained\r\nthat savages are quite indifferent about the beauty of their women,\r\nvaluing them solely as slaves, it may be well to observe that this\r\nconclusion does not at all agree with the care which the women take in\r\nornamenting themselves, or with their vanity. Burchell[424] gives an\r\namusing account of a Bushwoman, who used so much grease, red ochre, and\r\nshining powder, “as would have ruined any but a very rich husband.” She\r\ndisplayed also “much vanity and too evident a consciousness of her\r\nsuperiority.” Mr. Winwood Reade informs me that the negroes of the West\r\nCoast often discuss the beauty of their women. Some competent observers\r\nhave attributed the fearfully common practice of infanticide partly to\r\nthe desire felt by the women to retain their good looks.[425] In several\r\nregions the women wear charms and love-philters to gain the affections\r\nof the men; and Mr. Brown enumerates four plants used for this purpose\r\nby the women of North-Western America.[426]\r\n\r\nHearne,[427] who lived many years with the American Indians, and who was\r\nan excellent observer, says, in speaking of the women, “Ask a Northern\r\nIndian what is beauty, and he will answer, a broad flat face, small\r\neyes, high cheek-bones, three or four broad black lines across each\r\ncheek, a low forehead, a large broad chin, a clumsy hook nose, a tawny\r\nhide, and breasts hanging down to the belt.” Pallas, who visited the\r\nnorthern parts of the Chinese empire, says “those women are preferred\r\nwho have the Mandschú form; that is to say, a broad face, high\r\ncheek-bones, very broad noses, and enormous ears;”[428] and Vogt remarks\r\nthat the obliquity of the eye, which is proper to the Chinese and\r\nJapanese, is exaggerated in their pictures for the purpose, as “it\r\nseems, of exhibiting its beauty, as contrasted with the eye of the\r\nred-haired barbarians.” It is well known, as Huc repeatedly remarks,\r\nthat the Chinese of the interior think Europeans hideous with their\r\nwhite skins and prominent noses. The nose is far from being too\r\nprominent, according to our ideas, in the natives of Ceylon; yet “the\r\nChinese in the seventh century, accustomed to the flat features of the\r\nMogul races, were surprised at the prominent noses of the Cingalese; and\r\nThsang described them as having ‘the beak of a bird, with the body of a\r\nman.’”\r\n\r\nFinlayson, after minutely describing the people of Cochin China, says\r\nthat their rounded heads and faces are their chief characteristics; and,\r\nhe adds, “the roundness of the whole countenance is more striking in the\r\nwomen, who are reckoned beautiful in proportion as they display this\r\nform of face.” The Siamese have small noses with divergent nostrils, a\r\nwide mouth, rather thick lips, a remarkably large face, with very high\r\nand broad cheek-bones. It is, therefore, not wonderful that “beauty,\r\naccording to our notion is a stranger to them. Yet they consider their\r\nown females to be much more beautiful than those of Europe.”[429]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that with many Hottentot women the posterior part of\r\nthe body projects in a wonderful manner; they are steatopygous; and Sir\r\nAndrew Smith is certain that this peculiarity is greatly admired by the\r\nmen.[430] He once saw a woman who was considered a beauty, and she was\r\nso immensely developed behind, that when seated on level ground she\r\ncould not rise, and had to push herself along until she came to a slope.\r\nSome of the women in various negro tribes are similarly characterised;\r\nand, according to Burton, the Somal men “are said to choose their wives\r\nby ranging them in a line, and by picking her out who projects farthest\r\n_a tergo_. Nothing can be more hateful to a negro than the opposite\r\nform.”[431]\r\n\r\nWith respect to colour, the negroes rallied Mungo Park on the whiteness\r\nof his skin and the prominence of his nose, both of which they\r\nconsidered as “unsightly and unnatural conformations.” He in return\r\npraised the glossy jet of their skins and the lovely depression of their\r\nnoses; this they said was “honey-mouth,” nevertheless they gave him\r\nfood. The African Moors, also, “knitted their brows and seemed to\r\nshudder” at the whiteness of his skin. On the eastern coast, the negro\r\nboys when they saw Burton, cried out “Look at the white man; does he not\r\nlook like a white ape?” On the western coast, as Mr. Winwood Reade\r\ninforms me, the negroes admire a very black skin more than one of a\r\nlighter tint. But their horror of whiteness may be partly attributed,\r\naccording to this same traveller, to the belief held by most negroes\r\nthat demons and spirits are white.\r\n\r\nThe Banyai of the more southern part of the continent are negroes, but\r\n“a great many of them are of a light coffee-and-milk colour, and,\r\nindeed, this colour is considered handsome throughout the whole\r\ncountry;” so that here we have a different standard of taste. With the\r\nKafirs, who differ much from negroes, “the skin, except among the\r\ntribes near Delagoa Bay, is not usually black, the prevailing colour\r\nbeing a mixture of black and red, the most common shade being chocolate.\r\nDark complexions, as being most common are naturally held in the highest\r\nesteem. To be told that he is light-coloured, or like a white man, would\r\nbe deemed a very poor compliment by a Kafir. I have heard of one\r\nunfortunate man who was so very fair that no girl would marry him.” One\r\nof the titles of the Zulu king is “You who are black.”[432] Mr. Galton,\r\nin speaking to me about the natives of S. Africa, remarked that their\r\nideas of beauty seem very different from ours; for in one tribe two\r\nslim, slight, and pretty girls were not admired by the natives.\r\n\r\nTurning to other quarters of the world; in Java, a yellow, not a white\r\ngirl, is considered, according to Madame Pfeiffer, a beauty. A man of\r\nCochin-China “spoke with contempt of the wife of the English Ambassador,\r\nthat she had white teeth like a dog, and a rosy colour like that of\r\npotato-flowers.” We have seen that the Chinese dislike our white skin,\r\nand that the N. Americans admire “a tawny hide.” In S. America, the\r\nYura-caras, who inhabit the wooded, damp slopes of the eastern\r\nCordillera, are remarkably pale-coloured, as their name in their own\r\nlanguage expresses; nevertheless they consider European women as very\r\ninferior to their own.[433]\r\n\r\nIn several of the tribes of North America the hair on the head grows to\r\na wonderful length; and Catlin gives a curious proof how much this is\r\nesteemed, for the chief of the Crows was elected to this office from\r\nhaving the longest hair of any man in the tribe, namely ten feet and\r\nseven inches. The Aymaras and Quechuas of S. America, likewise have very\r\nlong hair; and this, as Mr. D. Forbes informs me, is so much valued for\r\nthe sake of beauty, that cutting it off was the severest punishment\r\nwhich he could inflict on them. In both halves of the continent the\r\nnatives sometimes increase the apparent length of their hair by weaving\r\ninto it fibrous substances. Although the hair on the head is thus\r\ncherished, that on the face is considered by the North American Indians\r\n“as very vulgar,” and every hair is carefully eradicated. This practice\r\nprevails throughout the American continent from Vancouver’s Island in\r\nthe north to Tierra del Fuego in the south. When York Minster, a Fuegian\r\non board the “Beagle” was taken back to his country, the natives told\r\nhim he ought to pull out the few short hairs on his face. They also\r\nthreatened a young missionary, who was left for a time with them, to\r\nstrip him naked, and pluck the hairs from his face and body, yet he was\r\nfar from a hairy man. This fashion is carried to such an extreme that\r\nthe Indians of Paraguay eradicate their eyebrows and eyelashes, saying\r\nthat they do not wish to be like horses.[434]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that throughout the world the races which are almost\r\ncompletely destitute of a beard dislike hairs on the face and body, and\r\ntake pains to eradicate them. The Kalmucks are beardless, and they are\r\nwell known, like the Americans, to pluck out all straggling hairs; and\r\nso it is with the Polynesians, some of the Malays, and the Siamese. Mr.\r\nVeitch states that the Japanese ladies “all objected to our whiskers,\r\nconsidering them very ugly, and told us to cut them off, and be like\r\nJapanese men.” The New Zealanders are beardless; they carefully pluck\r\nout the hairs on the face, and have a saying that “There is no woman for\r\na hairy man.”[435]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, bearded races admire and greatly value their beards;\r\namong the Anglo-Saxons every part of the body, according to their laws,\r\nhad a recognised value; “the loss of the beard being estimated at twenty\r\nshillings, while the breaking of a thigh was fixed at only twelve.”[436]\r\nIn the East men swear solemnly by their beards. We have seen that\r\nChinsurdi, the chief of the Makalolo in Africa, evidently thought that\r\nbeards were a great ornament. With the Fijians in the Pacific the beard\r\nis “profuse and bushy, and is his greatest pride;” whilst the\r\ninhabitants of the adjacent archipelagoes of Tonga and Samoa are\r\n“beardless, and abhor a rough chin.” In one island alone of the Ellice\r\ngroup “the men are heavily bearded, and not a little proud\r\nthereof.”[437]\r\n\r\nWe thus see how widely the different races of man differ in their taste\r\nfor the beautiful. In every nation sufficiently advanced to have made\r\neffigies of their gods or of their deified rulers, the sculptors no\r\ndoubt have endeavoured to express their highest ideal of beauty and\r\ngrandeur.[438] Under this point of view it is well to compare in our\r\nmind the Jupiter or Apollo of the Greeks with the Egyptian or Assyrian\r\nstatues; and these with the hideous bas-reliefs on the ruined buildings\r\nof Central America.\r\n\r\nI have met with very few statements opposed to the above conclusion. Mr.\r\nWinwood Reade, however, who has had ample opportunities for observation,\r\nnot only with the negroes of the West Coast of Africa, but with those of\r\nthe interior who have never associated with Europeans, is convinced that\r\ntheir ideas of beauty are _on the whole_ the same as ours. He has\r\nrepeatedly found that he agreed with negroes in their estimation of the\r\nbeauty of the native girls; and that their appreciation of the beauty of\r\nEuropean women corresponded with ours. They admire long hair, and use\r\nartificial means to make it appear abundant; they admire also a beard,\r\nthough themselves very scantily provided. Mr. Reade feels doubtful what\r\nkind of nose is most appreciated: a girl has been heard to say, “I do\r\nnot want to marry him, he has got no nose;” and this shews that a very\r\nflat nose is not an object of admiration. We should, however, bear in\r\nmind that the depressed and very broad noses and projecting jaws of the\r\nnegroes of the West Coast are exceptional types with the inhabitants of\r\nAfrica. Notwithstanding the foregoing statements, Mr. Reade does not\r\nthink it probable that negroes would ever prefer the “most beautiful\r\nEuropean woman, on the mere grounds of physical admiration, to a\r\ngood-looking negress.”[439]\r\n\r\nThe truth of the principle, long ago insisted on by Humboldt,[440] that\r\nman admires and often tries to exaggerate whatever characters nature may\r\nhave given him, is shewn in many ways. The practice of beardless races\r\nextirpating every trace of a beard, and generally all the hairs on the\r\nbody, offers one illustration. The skull has been greatly modified\r\nduring ancient and modern times by many nations; and there can be little\r\ndoubt that this has been practised, especially in N. and S. America, in\r\norder to exaggerate some natural and admired peculiarity. Many American\r\nIndians are known to admire a head flattened to such an extreme degree\r\nas to appear to us like that of an idiot. The natives on the\r\nnorth-western coast compress the head into a pointed cone; and it is\r\ntheir constant practice to gather the hair into a knot on the top of the\r\nhead, for the sake, as Dr. Wilson remarks, “of increasing the apparent\r\nelevation of the favourite conoid form.” The inhabitants of Arakhan\r\n“admire a broad, smooth forehead, and in order to produce it, they\r\nfasten a plate of lead on the heads of the newborn children.” On the\r\nother hand, “a broad, well-rounded occiput is considered a great\r\nbeauty” by the natives of the Fiji islands.[441]\r\n\r\nAs with the skull, so with the nose; the ancient Huns during the age of\r\nAttila were accustomed to flatten the noses of their infants with\r\nbandages, “for the sake of exaggerating a natural conformation.” With\r\nthe Tahitians, to be called, _long-nose_ is considered as an insult, and\r\nthey compress the noses and foreheads of their children for the sake of\r\nbeauty. So it is with the Malays of Sumatra, the Hottentots, certain\r\nNegroes, and the natives of Brazil.[442] The Chinese have by nature\r\nunusually small feet;[443] and it is well known that the women of the\r\nupper classes distort their feet to make them still smaller. Lastly,\r\nHumboldt thinks that the American Indians prefer colouring their bodies\r\nwith red paint in order to exaggerate their natural tint; and until\r\nrecently European women added to their naturally bright colours by rouge\r\nand white cosmetics; but I doubt whether many barbarous nations have had\r\nany such intention in painting themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the fashions of our own dress we see exactly the same principle and\r\nthe same desire to carry every point to an extreme; we exhibit, also,\r\nthe same spirit of emulation. But the fashions of savages are far more\r\npermanent than ours; and whenever their bodies are artificially\r\nmodified this is necessarily the case. The Arab women of the Upper Nile\r\noccupy about three days in dressing their hair; they never imitate other\r\ntribes, “but simply vie with each other in the superlativeness of their\r\nown style.” Dr. Wilson, in speaking of the compressed skulls of various\r\nAmerican races, adds, “such usages are among the least eradicable, and\r\nlong survive the shock of revolutions that change dynasties and efface\r\nmore important national peculiarities.”[444] The same principle comes\r\nlargely into play in the art of selection; and we can thus understand,\r\nas I have elsewhere explained,[445] the wonderful development of all the\r\nraces of animals and plants which are kept merely for ornament. Fanciers\r\nalways wish each character to be somewhat increased; they do not admire\r\na medium standard; they certainly do not desire any great and abrupt\r\nchange in the character of their breeds; they admire solely what they\r\nare accustomed to behold, but they ardently desire to see each\r\ncharacteristic feature a little more developed.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the perceptive powers of man and the lower animals are so\r\nconstituted that brilliant colours and certain forms, as well as\r\nharmonious and rhythmical sounds, give pleasure and are called\r\nbeautiful; but why this should be so, we know no more than why certain\r\nbodily sensations are agreeable and others disagreeable. It is certainly\r\nnot true that there is in the mind of man any universal standard of\r\nbeauty with respect to the human body. It is, however, possible that\r\ncertain tastes may in the course of time become inherited, though I know\r\nof no evidence in favour of this belief; and if so, each race would\r\npossess its own innate ideal standard of beauty. It has been argued[446]\r\nthat ugliness consists in an approach to the structure of the lower\r\nanimals, and this no doubt is true with the more civilised nations, in\r\nwhich intellect is highly appreciated; but a nose twice as prominent, or\r\neyes twice as large as usual, would not be an approach in structure to\r\nany of the lower animals, and yet would be utterly hideous. The men of\r\neach race prefer what they are accustomed to behold; they cannot endure\r\nany great change; but they like variety, and admire each characteristic\r\npoint carried to a moderate extreme.[447] Men accustomed to a nearly\r\noval face, to straight and regular features, and to bright colours,\r\nadmire, as we Europeans know, these points when strongly developed. On\r\nthe other hand, men accustomed to a broad face, with high cheek-bones, a\r\ndepressed nose, and a black skin, admire these points strongly\r\ndeveloped. No doubt characters of all kinds may easily be too much\r\ndeveloped for beauty. Hence a perfect beauty, which implies many\r\ncharacters modified in a particular manner, will in every race be a\r\nprodigy. As the great anatomist Bichat long ago said, if every one were\r\ncast in the same mould, there would be no such thing as beauty. If all\r\nour women were to become as beautiful as the Venus de Medici, we should\r\nfor a time be charmed; but we should soon wish for variety; and as soon\r\nas we had obtained variety, we should wish to see certain characters in\r\nour women a little exaggerated beyond the then existing common standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAN—_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\n   On the effects of the continued selection of women according\r\n   to a different standard of beauty in each race—On the causes\r\n   which interfere with sexual selection in civilised and savage\r\n   nations—Conditions favourable to sexual selection during\r\n   primeval times—On the manner of action of sexual selection\r\n   with mankind—On the women in savage tribes having some power\r\n   to choose their husbands—Absence of hair on the body, and\r\n   development of the beard—Colour of the skin—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last chapter that with all barbarous races\r\nornaments, dress, and external appearance are highly valued; and that\r\nthe men judge of the beauty of their women by widely different\r\nstandards. We must next inquire whether this preference and the\r\nconsequent selection during many generations of those women, which,\r\nappear to the men of each race the most attractive, has altered the\r\ncharacter either of the females alone or of both sexes. With mammals the\r\ngeneral rule appears to be that characters of all kinds are inherited\r\nequally by the males and females; we might therefore expect that with\r\nmankind any characters gained through sexual selection by the females\r\nwould commonly be transferred to the offspring of both sexes. If any\r\nchange has thus been effected it is almost certain that the different\r\nraces will have been differently modified, as each has its own standard\r\nof beauty.\r\n\r\nWith mankind, especially with savages, many causes interfere with the\r\naction of sexual selection as far as the bodily frame is concerned.\r\nCivilised men are largely attracted by the mental charms of women, by\r\ntheir wealth, and especially by their social position; for men rarely\r\nmarry into a much lower rank of life. The men who succeed in obtaining\r\nthe more beautiful women, will not have a better chance of leaving a\r\nlong line of descendants than other men with plainer wives, with the\r\nexception of the few who bequeath their fortunes according to\r\nprimogeniture. With respect to the opposite form of selection, namely of\r\nthe more attractive men by the women, although in civilised nations\r\nwomen have free or almost free choice, which is not the case with\r\nbarbarous races, yet their choice is largely influenced by the social\r\nposition and wealth of the men; and the success of the latter in life\r\nlargely depends on their intellectual powers and energy, or on the\r\nfruits of these same powers in their forefathers.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, reason to believe that sexual selection has effected\r\nsomething in certain civilised and semi-civilised nations. Many persons\r\nare convinced, as it appears to me with justice, that the members of our\r\naristocracy, including under this term all wealthy families in which\r\nprimogeniture has long prevailed, from having chosen during many\r\ngenerations from all classes the more beautiful women as their wives,\r\nhave become handsomer, according to the European standard of beauty,\r\nthan the middle classes; yet the middle classes are placed under equally\r\nfavourable conditions of life for the perfect development of the body.\r\nCook remarks that the superiority in personal appearance “which is\r\nobservable in the erees or nobles in all the other islands (of the\r\nPacific) is found in the Sandwich islands;” but this may be chiefly due\r\nto their better food and manner of life.\r\n\r\nThe old traveller Chardin, in describing the Persians, says their “blood\r\nis now highly refined by frequent intermixtures with the Georgians and\r\nCircassians, two nations which surpass all the world in personal beauty.\r\nThere is hardly a man of rank in Persia who is not born of a Georgian or\r\nCircassian mother.” He adds that they inherit their beauty, “not from\r\ntheir ancestors, for without the above mixture, the men of rank in\r\nPersia, who are descendants of the Tartars, would be extremely\r\nugly.”[448] Here is a more curious case: the priestesses who attended\r\nthe temple of Venus Erycina at San-Giuliano in Sicily, were selected for\r\ntheir beauty out of the whole of Greece; they were not vestal virgins,\r\nand Quatrefages,[449] who makes this statement, says that the women of\r\nSan-Giuliano are famous at the present day as the most beautiful in the\r\nisland, and are sought by artists as models. But it is obvious that the\r\nevidence in the above cases is doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe following case, though relating to savages, is well worth giving\r\nfrom its curiosity. Mr. Winwood Reade informs me that the Jollofs, a\r\ntribe of negroes on the west coast of Africa, “are remarkable for their\r\nuniformly fine appearance.” A friend of his asked one of these men, “How\r\nis it that every one whom I meet is so fine-looking, not only your men,\r\nbut your women?” The Jollof answered, “It is very easily explained: it\r\nhas always been our custom to pick out our worse-looking slaves and to\r\nsell them.” It need hardly be added that with all savages female slaves\r\nserve as concubines. That this negro should have attributed, whether\r\nrightly or wrongly, the fine appearance of his tribe, to the\r\nlong-continued elimination of the ugly women, is not so surprising as\r\nit may at first appear; for I have elsewhere shewn[450] that negroes\r\nfully appreciate the importance of selection in the breeding of their\r\ndomestic animals, and I could give from Mr. Reade additional evidence on\r\nthis head.\r\n\r\n_On the Causes which prevent or check the Action of Sexual Selection\r\nwith Savages._—The chief causes are, firstly, so-called communal\r\nmarriages or promiscuous intercourse; secondly, infanticide, especially\r\nof female infants; thirdly, early betrothals; and lastly, the low\r\nestimation in which women are held, as mere slaves. These four points\r\nmust be considered in some detail.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that as long as the pairing of man, or of any other\r\nanimal, is left to chance, with no choice exerted by either sex, there\r\ncan be no sexual selection; and no effect will be produced on the\r\noffspring by certain individuals having had an advantage over others in\r\ntheir courtship. Now it is asserted that there exist at the present day\r\ntribes which practise what Sir J. Lubbock by courtesy calls communal\r\nmarriages; that is, all the men and women in the tribe are husbands and\r\nwives to each other. The licentiousness of many savages is no doubt\r\nastonishingly great, but it seems to me that more evidence is requisite\r\nbefore we fully admit that their existing intercourse is absolutely\r\npromiscuous. Nevertheless all those who have most closely studied the\r\nsubject,[451] and whose judgment is worth much more than mine, believe\r\nthat communal marriage was the original and universal form throughout\r\nthe world, including the intermarriage of brothers and sisters. The\r\nindirect evidence in favour of this belief is extremely strong, and\r\nrests chiefly on the terms of relationship which are employed between\r\nthe members of the same tribe, implying a connection with the tribe\r\nalone, and not with either parent. But the subject is too large and\r\ncomplex for even an abstract to be here given, and I will confine myself\r\nto a few remarks. It is evident in the case of communal marriages, or\r\nwhere the marriage-tie is very loose, that the relationship of the child\r\nto its father cannot be known. But it seems almost incredible that the\r\nrelationship of the child to its mother should ever have been completely\r\nignored, especially as the women in most savage tribes nurse their\r\ninfants for a long time. Accordingly in many cases the lines of descent\r\nare traced through the mother alone, to the exclusion of the father. But\r\nin many other cases the terms employed express a connection with the\r\ntribe alone, to the exclusion even of the mother. It seems possible that\r\nthe connection between the related members of the same barbarous tribe,\r\nexposed to all sorts of danger, might be so much more important, owing\r\nto the need of mutual protection and aid, than that between the mother\r\nand her child, as to lead to the sole use of terms expressive of the\r\nformer relationships; but Mr. Morgan is convinced that this view of the\r\ncase is by no means sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe terms of relationship used in different parts of the world may be\r\ndivided, according to the author just quoted, into two great classes,\r\nthe classificatory and descriptive,—the latter being employed by us. It\r\nis the classificatory system which so strongly leads to the belief that\r\ncommunal and other extremely loose forms of marriage were originally\r\nuniversal. But as far as I can see, there is no necessity on this ground\r\nfor believing in absolutely promiscuous intercourse. Men and women, like\r\nmany of the lower animals, might formerly have entered into strict\r\nthough temporary unions for each birth, and in this case nearly as much\r\nconfusion would have arisen in the terms of relationship as in the case\r\nof promiscuous intercourse. As far as sexual selection is concerned, all\r\nthat is required is that choice should be exerted before the parents\r\nunite, and it signifies little whether the unions last for life or only\r\nfor a season.\r\n\r\nBesides the evidence derived from the terms of relationship, other lines\r\nof reasoning indicate the former wide prevalence of communal marriage.\r\nSir J. Lubbock ingeniously accounts[452] for the strange and\r\nwidely-extended habit of exogamy,—that is, the men of one tribe always\r\ntaking wives from a distinct tribe,—by communism having been the\r\noriginal form of marriage; so that a man never obtained a wife for\r\nhimself unless he captured her from a neighbouring and hostile tribe,\r\nand then she would naturally have become his sole and valuable property.\r\nThus the practice of capturing wives might have arisen; and from the\r\nhonour so gained might ultimately have become the universal habit. We\r\ncan also, according to Sir J. Lubbock,[452] thus understand “the\r\nnecessity of expiation for marriage as an infringement of tribal rites,\r\nsince, according to old ideas, a man had no right to appropriate to\r\nhimself that which belonged to the whole tribe.” Sir J. Lubbock further\r\ngives a most curious body of facts shewing that in old times high honour\r\nwas bestowed on women who were utterly licentious; and this, as he\r\nexplains, is intelligible, if we admit that promiscuous intercourse was\r\nthe aboriginal and therefore long revered custom of the tribe.[453]\r\n\r\nAlthough the manner of development of the marriage-tie is an obscure\r\nsubject, as we may infer from the divergent opinions on several points\r\nbetween the three authors who have studied it most closely, namely, Mr.\r\nMorgan, Mr. M’Lennan, and Sir J. Lubbock, yet from the foregoing and\r\nseveral other lines of evidence it seems certain that the habit of\r\nmarriage has been gradually developed, and that almost promiscuous\r\nintercourse was once extremely common throughout the world. Nevertheless\r\nfrom the analogy of the lower animals, more particularly of those which\r\ncome nearest to man in the series, I cannot believe that this habit\r\nprevailed at an extremely remote period, when man had hardly attained to\r\nhis present rank in the zoological scale. Man, as I have attempted to\r\nshew, is certainly descended from some ape-like creature. With the\r\nexisting Quadrumana, as far as their habits are known, the males of some\r\nspecies are monogamous, but live during only a part of the year with the\r\nfemales, as seems to be the case with the Orang. Several kinds, as some\r\nof the Indian and American monkeys, are strictly monogamous, and\r\nassociate all the year round with their wives. Others are polygamous, as\r\nthe Gorilla and several American species, and each family lives\r\nseparate. Even when this occurs, the families inhabiting the same\r\ndistrict are probably to a certain extent social: the Chimpanzee, for\r\ninstance, is occasionally met with in large bands. Again, other species\r\nare polygamous, but several males, each with their own females, live\r\nassociated in a body, as with several species of Baboons.[454] We may\r\nindeed conclude from what we know of the jealousy of all male\r\nquadrupeds, armed, as many of them are, with special weapons for\r\nbattling with their rivals, that promiscuous intercourse in a state of\r\nnature is extremely improbable. The pairing may not last for life, but\r\nonly for each birth; yet if the males which are the strongest and best\r\nable to defend or otherwise assist their females and young offspring,\r\nwere to select the more attractive females, this would suffice for the\r\nwork of sexual selection.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we look far enough back in the stream of time, it is\r\nextremely improbable that primeval men and women lived promiscuously\r\ntogether. Judging from the social habits of man as he now exists, and\r\nfrom most savages being polygamists, the most probable view is that\r\nprimeval man aboriginally lived in small communities, each with as many\r\nwives as he could support and obtain, whom he would have jealously\r\nguarded against all other men. Or he may have lived with several wives\r\nby himself, like the Gorilla; for all the natives “agree that but one\r\nadult male is seen in a band; when the young male grows up, a contest\r\ntakes place for mastery, and the strongest, by killing and driving out\r\nthe others, establishes himself as the head of the community.”[455] The\r\nyounger males, being thus expelled and wandering about, would, when at\r\nlast successful in finding a partner, prevent too close interbreeding\r\nwithin the limits of the same family.\r\n\r\nAlthough savages are now extremely licentious, and although communal\r\nmarriages may formerly have largely prevailed, yet many tribes practise\r\nsome form of marriage, but of a far more lax nature than with civilised\r\nnations. Polygamy, as just stated, is almost universally followed by the\r\nleading men in every tribe. Nevertheless there are tribes, standing\r\nalmost at the bottom of the scale, which are strictly monogamous. This\r\nis the case with the Veddahs of Ceylon: they have a saying, according to\r\nSir J. Lubbock,[456] “that death alone can separate husband and wife.”\r\nAn intelligent Kandyan chief, of course a polygamist, “was perfectly\r\nscandalized at the utter barbarism of living with only one wife, and\r\nnever parting until separated by death.” It was, he said, “just like the\r\nWanderoo monkeys.” Whether savages who now enter into some form of\r\nmarriage, either polygamous or monogamous, have retained this habit from\r\nprimeval times, or whether they have returned to some form of marriage,\r\nafter passing through a stage of promiscuous intercourse, I will not\r\npretend to conjecture.\r\n\r\n_Infanticide._—This practice is now very common throughout the world,\r\nand there is reason to believe that it prevailed much more extensively\r\nduring former times.[457] Barbarians find it difficult to support\r\nthemselves and their children, and it is a simple plan to kill their\r\ninfants. In South America some tribes, as Azara states, formerly\r\ndestroyed so many infants of both sexes, that they were on the point of\r\nextinction. In the Polynesian Islands women have been known to kill from\r\nfour or five to even ten of their children; and Ellis could not find a\r\nsingle woman who had not killed at least one. Wherever infanticide\r\nprevails the struggle for existence will be in so far less severe, and\r\nall the members of the tribe will have an almost equally good chance of\r\nrearing their few surviving children. In most cases a larger number of\r\nfemale than of male infants are destroyed, for it is obvious that the\r\nlatter are of most value to the tribe, as they will when grown up aid in\r\ndefending it, and can support themselves. But the trouble experienced by\r\nthe women in rearing children, their consequent loss of beauty, the\r\nhigher estimation set on them and their happier fate, when few in\r\nnumber, are assigned by the women themselves, and by various observers,\r\nas additional motives for infanticide. In Australia, where female\r\ninfanticide is still common, Sir G. Grey estimated the proportion of\r\nnative women to men as one to three; but others say as two to three. In\r\na village on the eastern frontier of India, Colonel Macculloch found not\r\na single female child.[458]\r\n\r\nWhen, owing to female infanticide, the women of a tribe are few in\r\nnumber, the habit of capturing wives from neighbouring tribes would\r\nnaturally arise. Sir J. Lubbock, however, as we have seen, attributes\r\nthe practice in chief part, to the former existence of communal\r\nmarriage, and to the men having consequently captured women from other\r\ntribes to hold as their sole property. Additional causes might be\r\nassigned, such as the communities being very small, in which case,\r\nmarriageable women would often be deficient. That the habit of capture\r\nwas most extensively practised during former times, even by the\r\nancestors of civilised nations, is clearly shewn by the preservation of\r\nmany curious customs and ceremonies, of which Mr. M’Lennan has given a\r\nmost interesting account. In our own marriages the “best man” seems\r\noriginally to have been the chief abettor of the bridegroom in the act\r\nof capture. Now as long as men habitually procured their wives through\r\nviolence and craft, it is not probable that they would have selected the\r\nmore attractive women; they would have been too glad to have seized on\r\nany woman. But as soon as the practice of procuring wives from a\r\ndistinct tribe was effected through barter, as now occurs in many\r\nplaces, the more attractive women would generally have been purchased.\r\nThe incessant crossing, however, between tribe and tribe, which\r\nnecessarily follows from any form of this habit would have tended to\r\nkeep all the people inhabiting the same country nearly uniform in\r\ncharacter; and this would have greatly interfered with the power of\r\nsexual selection in differentiating the tribes.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of women, consequent on female infanticide, leads, also, to\r\nanother practice, namely polyandry, which is still common in several\r\nparts of the world, and which formerly, as Mr. M’Lennan believes,\r\nprevailed almost universally; but this latter conclusion is doubted by\r\nMr. Morgan and Sir J. Lubbock.[459] Whenever two or more men are\r\ncompelled to marry one woman, it is certain that all the women of the\r\ntribe will get married, and there will be no selection by the men of the\r\nmore attractive women. But under these circumstances the women no doubt\r\nwill have the power of choice, and will prefer the more attractive men.\r\nAzara, for instance, describes how carefully a Guana woman bargains for\r\nall sorts of privileges, before accepting some one or more husbands; and\r\nthe men in consequence take unusual care of their personal\r\nappearance.[460] The very ugly men would perhaps altogether fail in\r\ngetting a wife, or get one later in life, but the handsomer men,\r\nalthough the most successful in obtaining wives, would not, as far as we\r\ncan see, leave more offspring to inherit their beauty than the less\r\nhandsome husbands of the same women.\r\n\r\n_Early Betrothals and Slavery of Women._—With many savages it is the\r\ncustom to betroth the females whilst mere infants; and this would\r\neffectually prevent preference being exerted on either side according to\r\npersonal appearance. But it would not prevent the more attractive women\r\nfrom being afterwards stolen or taken by force from their husbands by\r\nthe more powerful men; and this often happens in Australia, America, and\r\nother parts of the world. The same consequences with reference to sexual\r\nselection would to a certain extent follow when women are valued almost\r\nexclusively as slaves or beasts of burden, as is the case with most\r\nsavages. The men, however, at all times would prefer the handsomest\r\nslaves according to their standard of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus see that several customs prevail with savages which would\r\ngreatly interfere with, or completely stop, the action of sexual\r\nselection. On the other hand, the conditions of life to which savages\r\nare exposed, and some of their habits, are favourable to natural\r\nselection; and this always comes into play together with sexual\r\nselection. Savages are known to suffer severely from recurrent famines;\r\nthey do not increase their food by artificial means; they rarely refrain\r\nfrom marriage,[461] and generally marry young. Consequently they must be\r\nsubjected to occasional hard struggles for existence, and the favoured\r\nindividuals will alone survive.\r\n\r\nTurning to primeval times when men had only doubtfully attained the rank\r\nof manhood, they would probably have lived, as already stated, either as\r\npolygamists or temporarily as monogamists. Their intercourse, judging\r\nfrom analogy, would not then have been promiscuous. They would, no\r\ndoubt, have defended their females to the best of their power from\r\nenemies of all kinds, and would probably have hunted for their\r\nsubsistence, as well as for that of their offspring. The most powerful\r\nand able males would have succeeded best in the struggle for life and in\r\nobtaining attractive females. At this early period the progenitors of\r\nman, from having only feeble powers of reason, would not have looked\r\nforward to distant contingencies. They would have been governed more by\r\ntheir instincts and even less by their reason than are savages at the\r\npresent day. They would not at that period have partially lost one of\r\nthe strongest of all instincts, common to all the lower animals, namely\r\nthe love of their young offspring; and consequently they would not have\r\npractised infanticide. There would have been no artificial scarcity of\r\nwomen, and polyandry would not have been followed; there would have been\r\nno early betrothals; women would not have been valued as mere slaves;\r\nboth sexes, if the females as well as the males were permitted to exert\r\nany choice, would have chosen their partners, not for mental charms, or\r\nproperty, or social position, but almost solely from external\r\nappearance. All the adults would have married or paired, and all the\r\noffspring, as far as that was possible, would have been reared; so that\r\nthe struggle for existence would have been periodically severe to an\r\nextreme degree. Thus during these primordial times all the conditions\r\nfor sexual selection would have been much more favourable than at a\r\nlater period, when man had advanced in his intellectual powers, but had\r\nretrograded in his instincts. Therefore, whatever influence sexual\r\nselection may have had in producing the differences between the races of\r\nman, and between man and the higher Quadrumana, this influence would\r\nhave been much more powerful at a very remote period than at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Manner of Action of Sexual Selection with mankind._—With\r\nprimeval men under the favourable conditions just stated, and with those\r\nsavages who at the present time enter into any marriage tie (but subject\r\nto greater or less interference according as the habits of female\r\ninfanticide, early betrothals, &c., are more or less practised), sexual\r\nselection will probably have acted in the following manner. The\r\nstrongest and most vigorous men,—those who could best defend and hunt\r\nfor their families, and during later times the chiefs or\r\nhead-men,—those who were provided with the best weapons and who\r\npossessed the most property, such as a larger number of dogs or other\r\nanimals, would have succeeded in rearing a greater average number of\r\noffspring, than would the weaker, poorer and lower members of the same\r\ntribes. There can, also, be no doubt that such men would generally have\r\nbeen able to select the more attractive women. At present the chiefs of\r\nnearly every tribe throughout the world succeed in obtaining more than\r\none wife. Until recently, as I hear from Mr. Mantell, almost every girl\r\nin New Zealand, who was pretty, or promised to be pretty, was _tapu_ to\r\nsome chief. With the Kafirs, as Mr. C. Hamilton states,[462] “the chiefs\r\ngenerally have the pick of the women for many miles round, and are most\r\npersevering in establishing or confirming their privilege.” We have seen\r\nthat each race has its own style of beauty, and we know that it is\r\nnatural to man to admire each characteristic point in his domestic\r\nanimals, dress, ornaments, and personal appearance, when carried a\r\nlittle beyond the common standard. If then the several foregoing\r\npropositions be admitted, and I cannot see that they are doubtful, it\r\nwould be an inexplicable circumstance, if the selection of the more\r\nattractive women by the more powerful men of each tribe, who would rear\r\non an average a greater number of children, did not after the lapse of\r\nmany generations modify to a certain extent the character of the tribe.\r\n\r\nWith our domestic animals, when a foreign breed is introduced into a new\r\ncountry, or when a native breed is long and carefully attended to,\r\neither for use or ornament, it is found after several generations to\r\nhave undergone, whenever the means of comparison exist, a greater or\r\nless amount of change. This follows from unconscious selection during a\r\nlong series of generations—that is, the preservation of the most\r\napproved individuals—without any wish or expectation of such a result\r\non the part of the breeder. So again, if two careful breeders rear\r\nduring many years animals of the same family, and do not compare them\r\ntogether or with a common standard, the animals are found after a time\r\nto have become to the surprise of their owners slightly different.[463]\r\nEach breeder has impressed, as Von Nathusius well expresses it, the\r\ncharacter of his own mind—his own taste and judgment—on his animals.\r\nWhat reason, then, can be assigned why similar results should not follow\r\nfrom the long-continued selection of the most admired women by those men\r\nof each tribe, who were able to rear to maturity the greater number of\r\nchildren? This would be unconscious selection, for an effect would be\r\nproduced, independently of any wish or expectation on the part of the\r\nmen who preferred certain women to others.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the members of a tribe, in which some form of marriage\r\nwas practised, to spread over an unoccupied continent; they would soon\r\nsplit up into distinct hordes, which would be separated from each other\r\nby various barriers, and still more effectually by the incessant wars\r\nbetween all barbarous nations. The hordes would thus be exposed to\r\nslightly different conditions and habits of life, and would sooner or\r\nlater come to differ in some small degree. As soon as this occurred,\r\neach isolated tribe would form for itself a slightly different standard\r\nof beauty;[464] and then unconscious selection would come into action\r\nthrough the more powerful and leading savages preferring certain women\r\nto others. Thus the differences between the tribes, at first very\r\nslight, would gradually and inevitably be increased to a greater and\r\ngreater degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith animals in a state of nature, many characters proper to the males,\r\nsuch as size, strength, special weapons, courage and pugnacity, have\r\nbeen acquired through the law of battle. The semi-human progenitors of\r\nman, like their allies the Quadrumana, will almost certainly have been\r\nthus modified; and, as savages still fight for the possession of their\r\nwomen, a similar process of selection has probably gone on in a greater\r\nor less degree to the present day. Other characters proper to the males\r\nof the lower animals, such as bright colours and various ornaments, have\r\nbeen acquired by the more attractive males having been preferred by the\r\nfemales. There are, however, exceptional cases in which the males,\r\ninstead of having been the selected, have been the selectors. We\r\nrecognise such cases by the females having been rendered more highly\r\nornamented than the males,—their ornamental characters having been\r\ntransmitted exclusively or chiefly to their female offspring. One such\r\ncase has been described in the order to which man belongs, namely, with\r\nthe Rhesus monkey.\r\n\r\nMan is more powerful in body and mind than woman, and in the savage\r\nstate he keeps her in a far more abject state of bondage than does the\r\nmale of any other animal; therefore it is not surprising that he should\r\nhave gained the power of selection. Women are everywhere conscious of\r\nthe value of their beauty; and when they have the means, they take more\r\ndelight in decorating themselves with all sorts of ornaments than do\r\nmen. They borrow the plumes of male birds, with which nature decked this\r\nsex in order to charm the females. As women have long been selected for\r\nbeauty, it is not surprising that some of the successive variations\r\nshould have been transmitted in a limited manner; and consequently that\r\nwomen should have transmitted their beauty in a somewhat higher degree\r\nto their female than to their male offspring. Hence women have become\r\nmore beautiful, as most persons will admit, than men. Women, however,\r\ncertainly transmit most of their characters, including beauty, to their\r\noffspring of both sexes; so that the continued preference by the men of\r\neach race of the more attractive women, according to their standard of\r\ntaste, would tend to modify in the same manner all the individuals of\r\nboth sexes belonging to the race.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other form of sexual selection (which with the lower\r\nanimals is much the most common), namely, when the females are the\r\nselectors, and accept only those males which excite or charm them most,\r\nwe have reason to believe that it formerly acted on the progenitors of\r\nman. Man in all probability owes his beard, and perhaps some other\r\ncharacters, to inheritance from an ancient progenitor who gained in this\r\nmanner his ornaments. But this form of selection may have occasionally\r\nacted during later times; for in utterly barbarous tribes the women have\r\nmore power in choosing, rejecting, and tempting their lovers, or of\r\nafterwards changing their husbands, than might have been expected. As\r\nthis is a point of some importance, I will give in detail such evidence\r\nas I have been able to collect.\r\n\r\nHearne describes how a woman in one of the tribes of Arctic America\r\nrepeatedly ran away from her husband and joined a beloved man; and with\r\nthe Charruas of S. America, as Azara states, the power of divorce is\r\nperfectly free. With the Abipones, when a man chooses a wife he bargains\r\nwith the parents about the price. But “it frequently happens that the\r\ngirl rescinds what has been agreed upon between the parents and the\r\nbridegroom, obstinately rejecting the very mention of marriage.” She\r\noften runs away, hides herself, and thus eludes the bridegroom. In the\r\nFiji Islands the man seizes on the woman whom he wishes for his wife by\r\nactual or pretended force; but “on reaching the home of her abductor,\r\nshould she not approve of the match, she runs to some one who can\r\nprotect her; if, however, she is satisfied, the matter is settled\r\nforthwith.” In Tierra del Fuego a young man first obtains the consent of\r\nthe parents by doing them some service, and then he attempts to carry\r\noff the girl; “but if she is unwilling, she hides herself in the woods\r\nuntil her admirer is heartily tired of looking for her, and gives up the\r\npursuit; but this seldom happens.” With the Kalmucks there is a regular\r\nrace between the bride and bridegroom, the former having a fair start;\r\nand Clarke “was assured that no instance occurs of a girl being caught,\r\nunless she has a partiality to the pursuer.” So with the wild tribes of\r\nthe Malay archipelago there is a similar racing match; and it appears\r\nfrom M. Bourien’s account, as Sir J. Lubbock remarks, that “the race ‘is\r\nnot to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,’ but to the young man\r\nwho has the good fortune to please his intended bride.”\r\n\r\nTurning to Africa: the Kafirs buy their wives, and girls are severely\r\nbeaten by their fathers if they will not accept a chosen husband; yet it\r\nis manifest from many facts given by the Rev. Mr. Shooter, that they\r\nhave considerable power of choice. Thus very ugly, though rich men, have\r\nbeen known to fail in getting wives. The girls, before consenting to be\r\nbetrothed, compel the men to shew themselves off, first in front and\r\nthen behind, and “exhibit their paces.” They have been known to propose\r\nto a man, and they not rarely run away with a favoured lover. With the\r\ndegraded bushwomen of S. Africa, “when a girl has grown up to womanhood\r\nwithout having been betrothed, which, however, does not often happen,\r\nher lover must gain her approbation, as well as that of the\r\nparents.”[465] Mr. Winwood Reade made inquiries for me with respect to\r\nthe negroes of Western Africa, and he informs me that “the women, at\r\nleast among the more intelligent Pagan tribes, have no difficulty in\r\ngetting the husbands whom they may desire, although it is considered\r\nunwomanly to ask a man to marry them. They are quite capable of falling\r\nin love, and of forming tender, passionate, and faithful attachments.”\r\n\r\nWe thus see that with savages the women are not in quite so abject a\r\nstate in relation to marriage as has often been supposed. They can tempt\r\nthe men whom they prefer, and can sometimes reject those whom they\r\ndislike, either before or after marriage. Preference on the part of the\r\nwomen, steadily acting in any one direction, would ultimately affect the\r\ncharacter of the tribe; for the women would generally choose not merely\r\nthe handsomer men, according to their standard of taste, but those who\r\nwere at the same time best able to defend and support them. Such\r\nwell-endowed pairs would commonly rear a larger number of offspring than\r\nthe less well endowed. The same result would obviously follow in a still\r\nmore marked manner if there was selection on both sides; that is if the\r\nmore attractive, and at the same time more powerful men were to prefer,\r\nand were preferred by, the more attractive women. And these two forms of\r\nselection seem actually to have occurred, whether or not simultaneously,\r\nwith mankind, especially during the earlier periods of our long history.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider in a little more detail, relatively to sexual\r\nselection, some of the characters which distinguish the several races of\r\nman from each other and from the lower animals, namely, the more or less\r\ncomplete absence of hair from the body and the colour of the skin. We\r\nneed say nothing about the great diversity in the shape of the features\r\nand of the skull between the different races, as we have seen in the\r\nlast chapter how different is the standard of beauty in these respects.\r\nThese characters will therefore probably have been acted on through\r\nsexual selection; but we have no means of judging, as far as I can see,\r\nwhether they have been acted on chiefly through the male or female side.\r\nThe musical faculties of man have likewise been already discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Absence of Hair on the Body, and its Development on the Face and\r\nHead._—From the presence of the woolly hair or lanugo on the human\r\nfœtus, and of rudimentary hairs scattered over the body during\r\nmaturity, we may infer that man is descended from some animal which was\r\nborn hairy and remained so during life. The loss of hair is an\r\ninconvenience and probably an injury to man even under a hot climate,\r\nfor he is thus exposed to sudden chills, especially during wet weather.\r\nAs Mr. Wallace remarks, the natives in all countries are glad to protect\r\ntheir naked backs and shoulders with some slight covering. No one\r\nsupposes that the nakedness of the skin is any direct advantage to man,\r\nso that his body cannot have been divested of hair through natural\r\nselection.[466] Nor have we any grounds for believing, as shewn in a\r\nformer chapter, that this can be due to the direct action of the\r\nconditions to which man has long been exposed, or that it is the result\r\nof correlated development.\r\n\r\nThe absence of hair on the body is to a certain extent a secondary\r\nsexual character; for in all parts of the world women are less hairy\r\nthan men. Therefore we may reasonably suspect that this is a character\r\nwhich has been gained through sexual selection. We know that the faces\r\nof several species of monkeys, and large surfaces at the posterior end\r\nof the body in other species, have been denuded of hair; and this we may\r\nsafely attribute to sexual selection, for these surfaces are not only\r\nvividly coloured, but sometimes, as with the male mandrill and female\r\nrhesus, much more vividly in the one sex than in the other. As these\r\nanimals gradually reach maturity the naked surfaces, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Bartlett, grow larger, relatively to the size of their bodies. The\r\nhair, however, appears to have been removed in these cases, not for the\r\nsake of nudity, but that the colour of the skin should be more fully\r\ndisplayed. So again with many birds the head and neck have been divested\r\nof feathers through sexual selection, for the sake of exhibiting the\r\nbrightly-coloured skin.\r\n\r\nAs woman has a less hairy body than man, and as this character is common\r\nto all races, we may conclude that our female semi-human progenitors\r\nwere probably first partially divested of hair; and that this occurred\r\nat an extremely remote period before the several races had diverged from\r\na common stock. As our female progenitors gradually acquired this new\r\ncharacter of nudity, they must have transmitted it in an almost equal\r\ndegree to their young offspring of both sexes; so that its transmission,\r\nas in the case of many ornaments with mammals and birds, has not been\r\nlimited either by age or sex. There is nothing surprising in a partial\r\nloss of hair having been esteemed as ornamental by the ape-like\r\nprogenitors of man, for we have seen that with animals of all kinds\r\ninnumerable strange characters have been thus esteemed, and have\r\nconsequently been modified through sexual selection. Nor is it\r\nsurprising that a character in a slight degree injurious should have\r\nbeen thus acquired; for we know that this is the case with the plumes of\r\nsome birds, and with the horns of some stags.\r\n\r\nThe females of certain anthropoid apes, as stated in a former chapter,\r\nare somewhat less hairy on the under surface than are the males; and\r\nhere we have what might have afforded a commencement for the process of\r\ndenudation. With respect to the completion of the process through sexual\r\nselection, it is well to bear in mind the New Zealand proverb, “there is\r\nno woman for a hairy man.” All who have seen photographs of the Siamese\r\nhairy family will admit how ludicrously hideous is the opposite extreme\r\nof excessive hairiness. Hence the king of Siam had to bribe a man to\r\nmarry the first hairy woman in the family, who transmitted this\r\ncharacter to her young offspring of both sexes.[467]\r\n\r\nSome races are much more hairy than others, especially on the male side;\r\nbut it must not be assumed that the more hairy races, for instance\r\nEuropeans, have retained a primordial condition more completely than\r\nhave the naked races, such as the Kalmucks or Americans. It is a more\r\nprobable view that the hairiness of the former is due to partial\r\nreversion, for characters which have long been inherited are always apt\r\nto return. It does not appear that a cold climate has been influential\r\nin leading to this kind of reversion; excepting perhaps with the\r\nnegroes, who have been reared during several generations, in the United\r\nStates,[468] and possibly with the Ainos, who inhabit the northern\r\nislands of the Japan archipelago. But the laws of inheritance are so\r\ncomplex than we can seldom understand their action. If the greater\r\nhairiness of certain races be the result of reversion, unchecked by any\r\nform of selection, the extreme variability of this character, even\r\nwithin the limits of the same race, ceases to be remarkable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the beard, if we turn to our best guide, namely the\r\nQuadrumana, we find beards equally well developed in both sexes of many\r\nspecies, but in others, either confined to the males, or more developed\r\nin them than in the females. From this fact, and from the curious\r\narrangement, as well as the bright colours, of the hair about the heads\r\nof many monkeys, it is highly probable, as before explained, that the\r\nmales first acquired their beards as an ornament through sexual\r\nselection, transmitting them in most cases, in an equal or nearly equal\r\ndegree, to their offspring of both sexes. We know from Eschricht[469]\r\nthat with mankind, the female as well as the male fœtus is furnished\r\nwith much hair on the face, especially round the mouth; and this\r\nindicates that we are descended from a progenitor, of which both sexes\r\nwere bearded. It appears therefore at first sight probable that man has\r\nretained his beard from a very early period, whilst woman lost her beard\r\nat the same time when her body became almost completely divested of\r\nhair. Even the colour of the beard with mankind seems to have been\r\ninherited from an ape-like progenitor; for when there is any difference\r\nin tint between the hair of the head and the beard, the latter is\r\nlighter coloured in all monkeys and in man. There is less improbability\r\nin the men of the bearded races having retained their beards from\r\nprimordial times, than in the case of the hair on the body; for with\r\nthose Quadrumana, in which the male has a larger beard than that of the\r\nfemale, it is fully developed only at maturity, and the later stages of\r\ndevelopment may have been exclusively transmitted to mankind. We should\r\nthen see what is actually the case, namely, our male children, before\r\nthey arrive at maturity, as destitute of beards as are our female\r\nchildren. On the other hand the great variability of the beard within\r\nthe limits of the same race and in different races indicates that\r\nreversion has come into action. However this may be, we must not\r\noverlook the part which sexual selection may have played even during\r\nlater times; for we know that with savages, the men of the beardless\r\nraces take infinite pains in eradicating every hair from their faces, as\r\nsomething odious, whilst the men of the bearded races feel the greatest\r\npride in their beards. The women, no doubt, participate in these\r\nfeelings, and if so sexual selection can hardly have failed to have\r\neffected something in the course of later times.[470]\r\n\r\nIt is rather difficult to form a judgment how the long hair on our\r\nheads became developed. Eschricht[471] states that in the human fœtus\r\nthe hair on the face during the fifth month is longer than that on the\r\nhead; and this indicates that our semi-human progenitors were not\r\nfurnished with long tresses, which consequently must have been a late\r\nacquisition. This is likewise indicated by the extraordinary difference\r\nin the length of the hair in the different races; in the negro the hair\r\nforms a mere curly mat; with us it is of great length, and with the\r\nAmerican natives it not rarely reaches to the ground. Some species of\r\nSemnopithecus have their heads covered with moderately long hair, and\r\nthis probably serves as an ornament and was acquired through sexual\r\nselection. The same view may be extended to mankind, for we know that\r\nlong tresses are now and were formerly much admired, as may be observed\r\nin the works of almost every poet; St. Paul says, “if a woman have long\r\nhair, it is a glory to her;” and we have seen that in North America a\r\nchief was elected solely from the length of his hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colour of the Skin._—The best kind of evidence that the colour of the\r\nskin has been modified through sexual selection is wanting in the case\r\nof mankind; for the sexes do not differ in this respect, or only\r\nslightly and doubtfully. On the other hand we know from many facts\r\nalready given that the colour of the skin is regarded by the men of all\r\nraces as a highly important element in their beauty; so that it is a\r\ncharacter which would be likely to be modified through selection, as has\r\noccurred in innumerable instances with the lower animals. It seems at\r\nfirst sight a monstrous supposition that the jet blackness of the negro\r\nhas been gained through sexual selection; but this view is supported by\r\nvarious analogies, and we know that negroes admire their own blackness.\r\nWith mammals, when the sexes differ in colour, the male is often black\r\nor much darker than the female; and it depends merely on the form of\r\ninheritance whether this or any other tint shall be transmitted to both\r\nsexes or to one alone. The resemblance of _Pithecia satanas_ with his\r\njet black skin, white rolling eyeballs, and hair parted on the top of\r\nthe head, to a negro in miniature, is almost ludicrous.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the face differs much more widely in the various kinds of\r\nmonkeys than it does in the races of man; and we have good reason to\r\nbelieve that the red, blue, orange, almost white and black tints of\r\ntheir skin, even when common to both sexes, and the bright colours of\r\ntheir fur, as well as the ornamental tufts of hair about the head, have\r\nall been acquired through sexual selection. As the newly-born infants of\r\nthe most distinct races do not differ nearly as much in colour as do the\r\nadults, although their bodies are completely destitute of hair, we have\r\nsome slight indication that the tints of the different races were\r\nacquired subsequently to the removal of the hair, which, as before\r\nstated, must have occurred at a very early period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary._—We may conclude that the greater size, strength, courage,\r\npugnacity, and even energy of man, in comparison with the same qualities\r\nin woman, were acquired during primeval times, and have subsequently\r\nbeen augmented, chiefly through the contests of rival males for the\r\npossession of the females. The greater intellectual vigour and power of\r\ninvention in man is probably due to natural selection combined with the\r\ninherited effects of habit, for the most able men will have succeeded\r\nbest in defending and providing for themselves, their wives and\r\noffspring. As far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits us to\r\njudge, it appears that our male ape-like progenitors acquired their\r\nbeards as an ornament to charm or excite the opposite sex, and\r\ntransmitted them to man as he now exists. The females apparently were\r\nfirst denuded of hair in like manner as a sexual ornament; but they\r\ntransmitted this character almost equally to both sexes. It is not\r\nimprobable that the females were modified in other respects for the same\r\npurpose and through the same means; so that women have acquired sweeter\r\nvoices and become more beautiful than men.\r\n\r\nIt deserves particular attention that with mankind all the conditions\r\nfor sexual selection were much more favourable, during a very early\r\nperiod, when man had only just attained to the rank of manhood, than\r\nduring later times. For he would then, as we may safely conclude, have\r\nbeen guided more by his instinctive passions, and less by foresight or\r\nreason. He would not then have been so utterly licentious as many\r\nsavages now are; and each male would have jealously guarded his wife or\r\nwives. He would not then have practised infanticide; nor valued his\r\nwives merely as useful slaves; nor have been betrothed to them during\r\ninfancy. Hence we may infer that the races of men were differentiated,\r\nas far as sexual selection is concerned, in chief part during a very\r\nremote epoch; and this conclusion throws light on the remarkable fact\r\nthat at the most ancient period, of which we have as yet obtained any\r\nrecord, the races of man had already come to differ nearly or quite as\r\nmuch as they do at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe views here advanced, on the part which sexual selection has played\r\nin the history of man, want scientific precision. He who does not admit\r\nthis agency in the case of the lower animals, will properly disregard\r\nall that I have written in the later chapters on man. We cannot\r\npositively say that this character, but not that, has been thus\r\nmodified; it has, however, been shewn that the races of man differ from\r\neach other and from their nearest allies amongst the lower animals, in\r\ncertain characters which are of no service to them in their ordinary\r\nhabits of life, and which it is extremely probable would have been\r\nmodified through sexual selection. We have seen that with the lowest\r\nsavages the people of each tribe admire their own characteristic\r\nqualities,—the shape of the head and face, the squareness of the\r\ncheek-bones, the prominence or depression of the nose, the colour of the\r\nskin, the length of the hair on the head, the absence of hair on the\r\nface and body, or the presence of a great beard, and so forth. Hence\r\nthese and other such points could hardly fail to have been slowly and\r\ngradually exaggerated from the more powerful and able men in each tribe,\r\nwho would succeed in rearing the largest number of offspring, having\r\nselected during many generations as their wives the most strongly\r\ncharacterised and therefore most attractive women. For my own part I\r\nconclude that of all the causes which have led to the differences in\r\nexternal appearance between the races of man, and to a certain extent\r\nbetween man and the lower animals, sexual selection has been by far the\r\nmost efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Main conclusion that man is descended from some lower\r\n   form—Manner of development—Genealogy of man—Intellectual\r\n   and moral faculties—Sexual selection—Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief summary will here be sufficient to recall to the reader’s mind\r\nthe more salient points in this work. Many of the views which have been\r\nadvanced are highly speculative, and some no doubt will prove erroneous;\r\nbut I have in every case given the reasons which have led me to one view\r\nrather than to another. It seemed worth while to try how far the\r\nprinciple of evolution would throw light on some of the more complex\r\nproblems in the natural history of man. False facts are highly injurious\r\nto the progress of science, for they often long endure; but false views,\r\nif supported by some evidence, do little harm, as every one takes a\r\nsalutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when this is done, one\r\npath towards error is closed and the road to truth is often at the same\r\ntime opened.\r\n\r\nThe main conclusion arrived at in this work, and now held by many\r\nnaturalists who are well competent to form a sound judgment, is that man\r\nis descended from some less highly organised form. The grounds upon\r\nwhich this conclusion rests will never be shaken, for the close\r\nsimilarity between man and the lower animals in embryonic development,\r\nas well as in innumerable points of structure and constitution, both of\r\nhigh and of the most trifling importance,—the rudiments which he\r\nretains, and the abnormal reversions to which he is occasionally\r\nliable,—are facts which cannot be disputed. They have long been known,\r\nbut until recently they told us nothing with respect to the origin of\r\nman. Now when viewed by the light of our knowledge of the whole organic\r\nworld, their meaning is unmistakeable. The great principle of evolution\r\nstands up clear and firm, when these groups of facts are considered in\r\nconnection with others, such as the mutual affinities of the members of\r\nthe same group, their geographical distribution in past and present\r\ntimes, and their geological succession. It is incredible that all these\r\nfacts should speak falsely. He who is not content to look, like a\r\nsavage, at the phenomena of nature as disconnected, cannot any longer\r\nbelieve that man is the work of a separate act of creation. He will be\r\nforced to admit that the close resemblance of the embryo of man to that,\r\nfor instance, of a dog—the construction of his skull, limbs, and whole\r\nframe, independently of the uses to which the parts may be put, on the\r\nsame plan with that of other mammals—the occasional reappearance of\r\nvarious structures, for instance of several distinct muscles, which man\r\ndoes not normally possess, but which are common to the Quadrumana—and a\r\ncrowd of analogous facts—all point in the plainest manner to the\r\nconclusion that man is the co-descendant with other mammals of a common\r\nprogenitor.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that man incessantly presents individual differences in all\r\nparts of his body and in his mental faculties. These differences or\r\nvariations seem to be induced by the same general causes, and to obey\r\nthe same laws as with the lower animals. In both cases similar laws of\r\ninheritance prevail. Man tends to increase at a greater rate than his\r\nmeans of subsistence; consequently he is occasionally subjected to a\r\nsevere struggle for existence, and natural selection will have effected\r\nwhatever lies within its scope. A succession of strongly-marked\r\nvariations of a similar nature are by no means requisite; slight\r\nfluctuating differences in the individual suffice for the work of\r\nnatural selection. We may feel assured that the inherited effects of the\r\nlong-continued use or disuse of parts will have done much in the same\r\ndirection with natural selection. Modifications formerly of importance,\r\nthough no longer of any special use, will be long inherited. When one\r\npart is modified, other parts will change through the principle of\r\ncorrelation, of which we have instances in many curious cases of\r\ncorrelated monstrosities. Something may be attributed to the direct and\r\ndefinite action of the surrounding conditions of life, such as abundant\r\nfood, heat, or moisture; and lastly, many characters of slight\r\nphysiological importance, some indeed of considerable importance, have\r\nbeen gained through sexual selection.\r\n\r\nNo doubt man, as well as every other animal, presents structures, which\r\nas far as we can judge with our little knowledge, are not now of any\r\nservice to him, nor have been so during any former period of his\r\nexistence, either in relation to his general conditions of life, or of\r\none sex to the other. Such structures cannot be accounted for by any\r\nform of selection, or by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of\r\nparts. We know, however, that many strange and strongly-marked\r\npeculiarities of structure occasionally appear in our domesticated\r\nproductions, and if the unknown causes which produce them were to act\r\nmore uniformly, they would probably become common to all the individuals\r\nof the species. We may hope hereafter to understand something about the\r\ncauses of such occasional modifications, especially through the study\r\nof monstrosities: hence the labours of experimentalists, such as those\r\nof M. Camille Dareste, are full of promise for the future. In the\r\ngreater number of cases we can only say that the cause of each slight\r\nvariation and of each monstrosity lies much more in the nature or\r\nconstitution of the organism, than in the nature of the surrounding\r\nconditions; though new and changed conditions certainly play an\r\nimportant part in exciting organic changes of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThrough the means just specified, aided perhaps by others as yet\r\nundiscovered, man has been raised to his present state. But since he\r\nattained to the rank of manhood, he has diverged into distinct races, or\r\nas they may be more appropriately called sub-species. Some of these, for\r\ninstance the Negro and European, are so distinct that, if specimens had\r\nbeen brought to a naturalist without any further information, they would\r\nundoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species.\r\nNevertheless all the races agree in so many unimportant details of\r\nstructure and in so many mental peculiarities, that these can be\r\naccounted for only through inheritance from a common progenitor; and a\r\nprogenitor thus characterised would probably have deserved to rank as\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the divergence of each race from the other\r\nraces, and of all the races from a common stock, can be traced back to\r\nany one pair of progenitors. On the contrary, at every stage in the\r\nprocess of modification, all the individuals which were in any way best\r\nfitted for their conditions of life, though in different degrees, would\r\nhave survived in greater numbers than the less well fitted. The process\r\nwould have been like that followed by man, when he does not\r\nintentionally select particular individuals, but breeds from all the\r\nsuperior and neglects all the inferior individuals. He thus slowly but\r\nsurely modifies his stock, and unconsciously forms a new strain. So with\r\nrespect to modifications, acquired independently of selection, and due\r\nto variations arising from the nature of the organism and the action of\r\nthe surrounding conditions, or from changed habits of life, no single\r\npair will have been modified in a much greater degree than the other\r\npairs which inhabit the same country, for all will have been continually\r\nblended through free intercrossing.\r\n\r\nBy considering the embryological structure of man,—the homologies which\r\nhe presents with the lower animals,—the rudiments which he\r\nretains,—and the reversions to which he is liable, we can partly recall\r\nin imagination the former condition of our early progenitors; and can\r\napproximately place them in their proper position in the zoological\r\nseries. We thus learn that man is descended from a hairy quadruped,\r\nfurnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in its habits,\r\nand an inhabitant of the Old World. This creature, if its whole\r\nstructure had been examined by a naturalist, would have been classed\r\namongst the Quadrumana, as surely as would the common and still more\r\nancient progenitor of the Old and New World monkeys. The Quadrumana and\r\nall the higher mammals are probably derived from an ancient marsupial\r\nanimal, and this through a long line of diversified forms, either from\r\nsome reptile-like or some amphibian-like creature, and this again from\r\nsome fish-like animal. In the dim obscurity of the past we can see that\r\nthe early progenitor of all the Vertebrata must have been an aquatic\r\nanimal, provided with branchiæ, with the two sexes united in the same\r\nindividual, and with the most important organs of the body (such as the\r\nbrain and heart) imperfectly developed. This animal seems to have been\r\nmore like the larvæ of our existing marine Ascidians than any other\r\nknown form.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty which presents itself, when we are driven to the\r\nabove conclusion on the origin of man, is the high standard of\r\nintellectual power and of moral disposition which he has attained. But\r\nevery one who admits the general principle of evolution, must see that\r\nthe mental powers of the higher animals, which are the same in kind with\r\nthose of mankind, though so different in degree, are capable of\r\nadvancement. Thus the interval between the mental powers of one of the\r\nhigher apes and of a fish, or between those of an ant and scale-insect,\r\nis immense. The development of these powers in animals does not offer\r\nany special difficulty; for with our domesticated animals, the mental\r\nfaculties are certainly variable, and the variations are inherited. No\r\none doubts that these faculties are of the utmost importance to animals\r\nin a state of nature. Therefore the conditions are favourable for their\r\ndevelopment through natural selection. The same conclusion may be\r\nextended to man; the intellect must have been all-important to him, even\r\nat a very remote period, enabling him to use language, to invent and\r\nmake weapons, tools, traps, &c.; by which means, in combination with his\r\nsocial habits, he long ago became the most dominant of all living\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nA great stride in the development of the intellect will have followed,\r\nas soon as, through a previous considerable advance, the half-art and\r\nhalf-instinct of language came into use; for the continued use of\r\nlanguage will have reacted on the brain, and produced an inherited\r\neffect; and this again will have reacted on the improvement of\r\nlanguage. The large size of the brain in man, in comparison with that of\r\nthe lower animals, relatively to the size of their bodies, may be\r\nattributed in chief part, as Mr. Chauncey Wright has well remarked,[472]\r\nto the early use of some simple form of language,—that wonderful engine\r\nwhich affixes signs to all sorts of objects and qualities, and excites\r\ntrains of thought which would never arise from the mere impression of\r\nthe senses, and if they did arise could not be followed out. The higher\r\nintellectual powers of man, such as those of ratiocination, abstraction,\r\nself-consciousness, &c., will have followed from the continued\r\nimprovement of other mental faculties; but without considerable culture\r\nof the mind, both in the race and in the individual, it is doubtful\r\nwhether these high powers would be exercised, and thus fully attained.\r\n\r\nThe development of the moral qualities is a more interesting and\r\ndifficult problem. Their foundation lies in the social instincts,\r\nincluding in this term the family ties. These instincts are of a highly\r\ncomplex nature, and in the case of the lower animals give special\r\ntendencies towards certain definite actions; but the more important\r\nelements for us are love, and the distinct emotion of sympathy. Animals\r\nendowed with the social instincts take pleasure in each other’s company,\r\nwarn each other of danger, defend and aid each other in many ways. These\r\ninstincts are not extended to all the individuals of the species, but\r\nonly to those of the same community. As they are highly beneficial to\r\nthe species, they have in all probability been acquired through natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nA moral being is one who is capable of comparing his past and future\r\nactions and motives,—of approving of some and disapproving of others;\r\nand the fact that man is the one being who with certainty can be thus\r\ndesignated makes the greatest of all distinctions between him and the\r\nlower animals. But in our third chapter I have endeavoured to shew that\r\nthe moral sense follows, firstly, from the enduring and always present\r\nnature of the social instincts, in which respect man agrees with the\r\nlower animals; and secondly, from his mental faculties being highly\r\nactive and his impressions of past events extremely vivid, in which\r\nrespects he differs from the lower animals. Owing to this condition of\r\nmind, man cannot avoid looking backwards and comparing the impressions\r\nof past events and actions. He also continually looks forward. Hence\r\nafter some temporary desire or passion has mastered his social\r\ninstincts, he will reflect and compare the now weakened impression of\r\nsuch past impulses, with the ever present social instinct; and he will\r\nthen feel that sense of dissatisfaction which all unsatisfied instincts\r\nleave behind them. Consequently he resolves to act differently for the\r\nfuture—and this is conscience. Any instinct which is permanently\r\nstronger or more enduring than another, gives rise to a feeling which we\r\nexpress by saying that it ought to be obeyed. A pointer dog, if able to\r\nreflect on his past conduct, would say to himself, I ought (as indeed we\r\nsay of him) to have pointed at that hare and not have yielded to the\r\npassing temptation of hunting it.\r\n\r\nSocial animals are partly impelled by a wish to aid the members of the\r\nsame community in a general manner, but more commonly to perform certain\r\ndefinite actions. Man is impelled by the same general wish to aid his\r\nfellows, but has few or no special instincts. He differs also from the\r\nlower animals in being able to express his desires by words, which thus\r\nbecome the guide to the aid required and bestowed. The motive to give\r\naid is likewise somewhat modified in man: it no longer consists solely\r\nof a blind instinctive impulse, but is largely influenced by the praise\r\nor blame of his fellow men. Both the appreciation and the bestowal of\r\npraise and blame rest on sympathy; and this emotion, as we have seen, is\r\none of the most important elements of the social instincts. Sympathy,\r\nthough gained as an instinct, is also much strengthened by exercise or\r\nhabit. As all men desire their own happiness, praise or blame is\r\nbestowed on actions and motives, according as they lead to this end; and\r\nas happiness is an essential part of the general good, the\r\ngreatest-happiness principle indirectly serves as a nearly safe standard\r\nof right and wrong. As the reasoning powers advance and experience is\r\ngained, the more remote effects of certain lines of conduct on the\r\ncharacter of the individual, and on the general good, are perceived; and\r\nthen the self-regarding virtues, from coming within the scope of public\r\nopinion, receive praise, and their opposites receive blame. But with the\r\nless civilised nations reason often errs, and many bad customs and base\r\nsuperstitions come within the same scope, and consequently are esteemed\r\nas high virtues, and their breach as heavy crimes.\r\n\r\nThe moral faculties are generally esteemed, and with justice, as of\r\nhigher value than the intellectual powers. But we should always bear in\r\nmind that the activity of the mind in vividly recalling past impressions\r\nis one of the fundamental though secondary bases of conscience. This\r\nfact affords the strongest argument for educating and stimulating in all\r\npossible ways the intellectual faculties of every human being. No doubt\r\na man with a torpid mind, if his social affections and sympathies are\r\nwell developed, will be led to good actions, and may have a fairly\r\nsensitive conscience. But whatever renders the imagination of men more\r\nvivid and strengthens the habit of recalling and comparing past\r\nimpressions, will make the conscience more sensitive, and may even\r\ncompensate to a certain extent for weak social affections and\r\nsympathies.\r\n\r\nThe moral nature of man has reached the highest standard as yet\r\nattained, partly through the advancement of the reasoning powers and\r\nconsequently of a just public opinion, but especially through the\r\nsympathies being rendered more tender and widely diffused through the\r\neffects of habit, example, instruction, and reflection. It is not\r\nimprobable that virtuous tendencies may through long practice be\r\ninherited. With the more civilised races, the conviction of the\r\nexistence of an all-seeing Deity has had a potent influence on the\r\nadvancement of morality. Ultimately man no longer accepts the praise or\r\nblame of his fellows as his chief guide, though few escape this\r\ninfluence, but his habitual convictions controlled by reason afford him\r\nthe safest rule. His conscience then becomes his supreme judge and\r\nmonitor. Nevertheless the first foundation or origin of the moral sense\r\nlies in the social instincts, including sympathy; and these instincts no\r\ndoubt were primarily gained, as in the case of the lower animals,\r\nthrough natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest, but\r\nthe most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower\r\nanimals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that\r\nthis belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief\r\nin all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and\r\napparently follows from a considerable advance in the reasoning powers\r\nof man, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of\r\nimagination, curiosity and wonder. I am aware that the assumed\r\ninstinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument\r\nfor His existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should thus be\r\ncompelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant\r\nspirits, possessing only a little more power than man; for the belief in\r\nthem is far more general than of a beneficent Deity. The idea of a\r\nuniversal and beneficent Creator of the universe does not seem to arise\r\nin the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nHe who believes in the advancement of man from some lowly-organised\r\nform, will naturally ask how does this bear on the belief in the\r\nimmortality of the soul. The barbarous races of man, as Sir J. Lubbock\r\nhas shewn, possess no clear belief of this kind; but arguments derived\r\nfrom the primeval beliefs of savages are, as we have just seen, of\r\nlittle or no avail. Few persons feel any anxiety from the impossibility\r\nof determining at what precise period in the development of the\r\nindividual, from the first trace of the minute germinal vesicle to the\r\nchild either before or after birth, man becomes an immortal being; and\r\nthere is no greater cause for anxiety because the period in the\r\ngradually ascending organic scale cannot possibly be determined.[473]\r\n\r\nI am aware that the conclusions arrived at in this work will be\r\ndenounced by some as highly irreligious; but he who thus denounces them\r\nis bound to shew why it is more irreligious to explain the origin of man\r\nas a distinct species by descent from some lower form, through the laws\r\nof variation and natural selection, than to explain the birth of the\r\nindividual through the laws of ordinary reproduction. The birth both of\r\nthe species and of the individual are equally parts of that grand\r\nsequence of events, which our minds refuse to accept as the result of\r\nblind chance. The understanding revolts at such a conclusion, whether or\r\nnot we are able to believe that every slight variation of\r\nstructure,—the union of each pair in marriage,—the dissemination of\r\neach seed,—and other such events, have all been ordained for some\r\nspecial purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nSexual selection has been treated at great length in these volumes; for,\r\nas I have attempted to shew, it has played an important part in the\r\nhistory of the organic world. As summaries have been given to each\r\nchapter, it would be superfluous here to add a detailed summary. I am\r\naware that much remains doubtful, but I have endeavoured to give a fair\r\nview of the whole case. In the lower divisions of the animal kingdom,\r\nsexual selection seems to have done nothing: such animals are often\r\naffixed for life to the same spot, or have the two sexes combined in the\r\nsame individual, or what is still more important, their perceptive and\r\nintellectual faculties are not sufficiently advanced to allow of the\r\nfeelings of love and jealousy, or of the exertion of choice. When,\r\nhowever, we come to the Arthropoda and Vertebrata, even to the lowest\r\nclasses in these two great Sub-Kingdoms, sexual selection has effected\r\nmuch; and it deserves notice that we here find the intellectual\r\nfaculties developed, but in two very distinct lines, to the highest\r\nstandard, namely in the Hymenoptera (ants, bees, &c.) amongst the\r\nArthropoda, and in the Mammalia, including man, amongst the Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nIn the most distinct classes of the animal kingdom, with mammals,\r\nbirds, reptiles, fishes, insects, and even crustaceans, the differences\r\nbetween the sexes follow almost exactly the same rules. The males are\r\nalmost always the wooers; and they alone are armed with special weapons\r\nfor fighting with their rivals. They are generally stronger and larger\r\nthan the females, and are endowed with the requisite qualities of\r\ncourage and pugnacity. They are provided, either exclusively or in a\r\nmuch higher degree than the females, with organs for producing vocal or\r\ninstrumental music, and with odoriferous glands. They are ornamented\r\nwith infinitely diversified appendages, and with the most brilliant or\r\nconspicuous colours, often arranged in elegant patterns, whilst the\r\nfemales are left unadorned. When the sexes differ in more important\r\nstructures, it is the male which is provided with special sense-organs\r\nfor discovering the female, with locomotive organs for reaching her, and\r\noften with prehensile organs for holding her. These various structures\r\nfor securing or charming the female are often developed in the male\r\nduring only part of the year, namely the breeding season. They have in\r\nmany cases been transferred in a greater or less degree to the females;\r\nand in the latter case they appear in her as mere rudiments. They are\r\nlost by the males after emasculation. Generally they are not developed\r\nin the male during early youth, but appear a short time before the age\r\nfor reproduction. Hence in most cases the young of both sexes resemble\r\neach other; and the female resembles her young offspring throughout\r\nlife. In almost every great class a few anomalous cases occur in which\r\nthere has been an almost complete transposition of the characters proper\r\nto the two sexes; the females assuming characters which properly belong\r\nto the males. This surprising uniformity in the laws regulating the\r\ndifferences between the sexes in so many and such widely separated\r\nclasses, is intelligible if we admit the action throughout all the\r\nhigher divisions of the animal kingdom of one common cause, namely\r\nsexual selection.\r\n\r\nSexual selection depends on the success of certain individuals over\r\nothers of the same sex in relation to the propagation of the species;\r\nwhilst natural selection depends on the success of both sexes, at all\r\nages, in relation to the general conditions of life. The sexual struggle\r\nis of two kinds; in the one it is between the individuals of the same\r\nsex, generally the male sex, in order to drive away or kill their\r\nrivals, the females remaining passive; whilst in the other, the struggle\r\nis likewise between the individuals of the same sex, in order to excite\r\nor charm those of the opposite sex, generally the females, which no\r\nlonger remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners. This\r\nlatter kind of selection is closely analogous to that which man\r\nunintentionally, yet effectually, brings to bear on his domesticated\r\nproductions, when he continues for a long time choosing the most\r\npleasing or useful individuals, without any wish to modify the breed.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance determine whether characters gained through\r\nsexual selection by either sex shall be transmitted to the same sex, or\r\nto both sexes; as well as the age at which they shall be developed. It\r\nappears that variations which arise late in life are commonly\r\ntransmitted to one and the same sex. Variability is the necessary basis\r\nfor the action of selection, and is wholly independent of it. It follows\r\nfrom this, that variations of the same general nature have often been\r\ntaken advantage of and accumulated through sexual selection in relation\r\nto the propagation of the species, and through natural selection in\r\nrelation to the general purposes of life. Hence secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, when equally transmitted to both sexes can be distinguished\r\nfrom ordinary specific characters only by the light of analogy. The\r\nmodifications acquired through sexual selection are often so strongly\r\npronounced that the two sexes have frequently been ranked as distinct\r\nspecies, or even as distinct genera. Such strongly-marked differences\r\nmust be in some manner highly important; and we know that they have been\r\nacquired in some instances at the cost not only of inconvenience, but of\r\nexposure to actual danger.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the power of sexual selection rests chiefly on the\r\nfollowing considerations. The characters which we have the best reason\r\nfor supposing to have been thus acquired are confined to one sex; and\r\nthis alone renders it probable that they are in some way connected with\r\nthe act of reproduction. These characters in innumerable instances are\r\nfully developed only at maturity; and often during only a part of the\r\nyear, which is always the breeding-season. The males (passing over a few\r\nexceptional cases) are the most active in courtship; they are the best\r\narmed, and are rendered the most attractive in various ways. It is to be\r\nespecially observed that the males display their attractions with\r\nelaborate care in the presence of the females; and that they rarely or\r\nnever display them excepting during the season of love. It is incredible\r\nthat all this display should be purposeless. Lastly we have distinct\r\nevidence with some quadrupeds and birds that the individuals of the one\r\nsex are capable of feeling a strong antipathy or preference for certain\r\nindividuals of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nBearing these facts in mind, and not forgetting the marked results of\r\nman’s unconscious selection, it seems to me almost certain that if the\r\nindividuals of one sex were during a long series of generations to\r\nprefer pairing with certain individuals of the other sex, characterised\r\nin some peculiar manner, the offspring would slowly but surely become\r\nmodified in this same manner. I have not attempted to conceal that,\r\nexcepting when the males are more numerous than the females, or when\r\npolygamy prevails, it is doubtful how the more attractive males succeed\r\nin leaving a larger number of offspring to inherit their superiority in\r\nornaments or other charms than the less attractive males; but I have\r\nshewn that this would probably follow from the females,—especially the\r\nmore vigorous females which would be the first to breed, preferring not\r\nonly the more attractive but at the same time the more vigorous and\r\nvictorious males.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have some positive evidence that birds appreciate bright and\r\nbeautiful objects, as with the Bower-birds of Australia, and although\r\nthey certainly appreciate the power of song, yet I fully admit that it\r\nis an astonishing fact that the females of many birds and some mammals\r\nshould be endowed with sufficient taste for what has apparently been\r\neffected through sexual selection; and this is even more astonishing in\r\nthe case of reptiles, fish, and insects. But we really know very little\r\nabout the minds of the lower animals. It cannot be supposed that male\r\nBirds of Paradise or Peacocks, for instance, should take so much pains\r\nin erecting, spreading, and vibrating their beautiful plumes before the\r\nfemales for no purpose. We should remember the fact given on excellent\r\nauthority in a former chapter, namely that several peahens, when\r\ndebarred from an admired male, remained widows during a whole season\r\nrather than pair with another bird.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I know of no fact in natural history more wonderful than\r\nthat the female Argus pheasant should be able to appreciate the\r\nexquisite shading of the ball-and-socket ornaments and the elegant\r\npatterns on the wing-feathers of the male. He who thinks that the male\r\nwas created as he now exists must admit that the great plumes, which\r\nprevent the wings from being used for flight, and which, as well as the\r\nprimary feathers, are displayed in a manner quite peculiar to this one\r\nspecies during the act of courtship, and at no other time, were given to\r\nhim as an ornament. If so, he must likewise admit that the female was\r\ncreated and endowed with the capacity of appreciating such ornaments. I\r\ndiffer only in the conviction that the male Argus pheasant acquired his\r\nbeauty gradually, through the females having preferred during many\r\ngenerations the more highly ornamented males; the æsthetic capacity of\r\nthe females having been advanced through exercise or habit in the same\r\nmanner as our own taste is gradually improved. In the male, through the\r\nfortunate chance of a few feathers not having been modified, we can\r\ndistinctly see how simple spots with a little fulvous shading on one\r\nside might have been developed by small and graduated steps into the\r\nwonderful ball-and-socket ornaments; and it is probable that they were\r\nactually thus developed.\r\n\r\nEveryone who admits the principle of evolution, and yet feels great\r\ndifficulty in admitting that female mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish,\r\ncould have acquired the high standard of taste which is implied by the\r\nbeauty of the males, and which generally coincides with our own\r\nstandard, should reflect that in each member of the vertebrate series\r\nthe nerve-cells of the brain are the direct offshoots of those possessed\r\nby the common progenitor of the whole group. It thus becomes\r\nintelligible that the brain and mental faculties should be capable under\r\nsimilar conditions of nearly the same course of development, and\r\nconsequently of performing nearly the same functions.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has taken the trouble to go through the several chapters\r\ndevoted to sexual selection, will be able to judge how far the\r\nconclusions at which I have arrived are supported by sufficient\r\nevidence. If he accepts these conclusions, he may, I think, safely\r\nextend them to mankind; but it would be superfluous here to repeat what\r\nI have so lately said on the manner in which sexual selection has\r\napparently acted on both the male and female side, causing the two sexes\r\nof man to differ in body and mind, and the several races to differ from\r\neach other in various characters, as well as from their ancient and\r\nlowly-organised progenitors.\r\n\r\nHe who admits the principle of sexual selection will be led to the\r\nremarkable conclusion that the cerebral system not only regulates most\r\nof the existing functions of the body, but has indirectly influenced the\r\nprogressive development of various bodily structures and of certain\r\nmental qualities. Courage, pugnacity, perseverance, strength and size of\r\nbody, weapons of all kinds, musical organs, both vocal and instrumental,\r\nbright colours, stripes and marks, and ornamental appendages, have all\r\nbeen indirectly gained by the one sex or the other, through the\r\ninfluence of love and jealousy, through the appreciation of the\r\nbeautiful in sound, colour or form, and through the exertion of a\r\nchoice; and these powers of the mind manifestly depend on the\r\ndevelopment of the cerebral system.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan scans with scrupulous care the character and pedigree of his horses,\r\ncattle, and dogs before he matches them; but when he comes to his own\r\nmarriage he rarely, or never, takes any such care. He is impelled by\r\nnearly the same motives as are the lower animals when left to their own\r\nfree choice, though he is in so far superior to them that he highly\r\nvalues mental charms and virtues. On the other hand he is strongly\r\nattracted by mere wealth or rank. Yet he might by selection do something\r\nnot only for the bodily constitution and frame of his offspring, but for\r\ntheir intellectual and moral qualities. Both sexes ought to refrain from\r\nmarriage if in any marked degree inferior in body or mind; but such\r\nhopes are Utopian and will never be even partially realised until the\r\nlaws of inheritance are thoroughly known. All do good service who aid\r\ntowards this end. When the principles of breeding and of inheritance are\r\nbetter understood, we shall not hear ignorant members of our legislature\r\nrejecting with scorn a plan for ascertaining by an easy method whether\r\nor not consanguineous marriages are injurious to man.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the welfare of mankind is a most intricate problem:\r\nall ought to refrain from marriage who cannot avoid abject poverty for\r\ntheir children; for poverty is not only a great evil, but tends to its\r\nown increase by leading to recklessness in marriage. On the other hand,\r\nas Mr. Galton has remarked, if the prudent avoid marriage, whilst the\r\nreckless marry, the inferior members will tend to supplant the better\r\nmembers of society. Man, like every other animal, has no doubt advanced\r\nto his present high condition through a struggle for existence\r\nconsequent on his rapid multiplication; and if he is to advance still\r\nhigher he must remain subject to a severe struggle. Otherwise he would\r\nsoon sink into indolence, and the more highly-gifted men would not be\r\nmore successful in the battle of life than the less gifted. Hence our\r\nnatural rate of increase, though leading to many and obvious evils, must\r\nnot be greatly diminished by any means. There should be open competition\r\nfor all men; and the most able should not be prevented by laws or\r\ncustoms from succeeding best and rearing the largest number of\r\noffspring. Important as the struggle for existence has been and even\r\nstill is, yet as far as the highest part of man’s nature is concerned\r\nthere are other agencies more important. For the moral qualities are\r\nadvanced, either directly or indirectly, much more through the effects\r\nof habit, the reasoning powers, instruction, religion, &c., than through\r\nnatural selection; though to this latter agency the social instincts,\r\nwhich afforded the basis for the development of the moral sense, may be\r\nsafely attributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely that man is\r\ndescended from some lowly-organised form, will, I regret to think, be\r\nhighly distasteful to many persons. But there can hardly be a doubt that\r\nwe are descended from barbarians. The astonishment which I felt on first\r\nseeing a party of Fuegians on a wild and broken shore will never be\r\nforgotten by me, for the reflection at once rushed into my mind—such\r\nwere our ancestors. These men were absolutely naked and bedaubed with\r\npaint, their long hair was tangled, their mouths frothed with\r\nexcitement, and their expression was wild, startled, and distrustful.\r\nThey possessed hardly any arts, and like wild animals lived on what they\r\ncould catch; they had no government, and were merciless to every one not\r\nof their own small tribe. He who has seen a savage in his native land\r\nwill not feel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the blood of\r\nsome more humble creature flows in his veins. For my own part I would as\r\nsoon be descended from that heroic little monkey, who braved his dreaded\r\nenemy in order to save the life of his keeper; or from that old baboon,\r\nwho, descending from the mountains, carried away in triumph his young\r\ncomrade from a crowd of astonished dogs—as from a savage who delights\r\nto torture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices, practises\r\ninfanticide without remorse, treats his wives like slaves, knows no\r\ndecency, and is haunted by the grossest superstitions.\r\n\r\nMan may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen, though not\r\nthrough his own exertions, to the very summit of the organic scale; and\r\nthe fact of his having thus risen, instead of having been aboriginally\r\nplaced there, may give him hopes for a still higher destiny in the\r\ndistant future. But we are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only\r\nwith the truth as far as our reason allows us to discover it. I have\r\ngiven the evidence to the best of my ability; and we must acknowledge,\r\nas it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy\r\nwhich feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not\r\nonly to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like\r\nintellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of\r\nthe solar system—with all these exalted powers—Man still bears in his\r\nbodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1] Yarrell’s ‘Hist. of British Fishes,’ vol. ii. 1836, p. 417,\r\n  425, 436.

In\r\n  another place it is said that since the year 1548 there has\r\n  been “produced at Hang-chow a variety called the fire-fish,\r\n  from its intensely red colour.

Transact.’ 1824. In regard to birds\r\n  living in triplets, I owe to Mr. Jenner Weir the cases of the\r\n  starling and parrots, and to Mr. Fox, of partridges; on\r\n  carrion-crows, see the ‘Field,’ 1868, p. 415. On various male\r\n  birds singing after the proper period, see Rev. L.

Morris, on the authority of the Hon.\r\n  and Rev. O. W. Forester. “The gamekeeper here found a hawk’s\r\n  nest this year, with five young ones in it. He took four and\r\n  killed them, but left one with its wings clipped as a decoy to\r\n  destroy the old ones by. They were both shot next day, in the\r\n  act of feeding the young one, and the keeper thought it was\r\n  done with. The next day he came again and found two other\r\n  charitable hawks, who had come with an adopted feeling to\r\n  succour the orphan. These two he killed, and then left the\r\n  nest. On returning afterwards he found two more charitable\r\n  individuals on the same errand of mercy. One of these he\r\n  killed; the other he also shot, but could not find. No more\r\n  came on the like fruitless errand.”\r\n\r\n  [156] For instance, Mr. Yarrell states (‘Hist. British Birds,’\r\n  vol. iii. 1845, p. 585) that a gull was not able to swallow a\r\n  small bird which had been given to it. The gull “paused for a\r\n  moment, and then, as if suddenly recollecting himself, ran off\r\n  at full speed to a pan of water, shook the bird about in it\r\n  until well soaked, and immediately gulped it down. Since that\r\n  time he invariably has had recourse to the same expedient in\r\n  similar cases.”\r\n\r\n  [157] ‘A Tour in Sutherlandshire,’ vol. i. 1849, p. 185.\r\n\r\n  [158] ‘Acclimatization of Parrots,’ by C.

Of the latter, Blasius thinks that only ten\r\n  are really doubtful, and that the other fifty ought to be\r\n  united with their nearest allies; but this shews that there\r\n  must be a considerable amount of variation with some of our\r\n  European birds. It is also an unsettled point with naturalists,\r\n  whether several North American birds ought to be ranked as\r\n  specifically distinct from the corresponding European species.\r\n\r\n  [179] ‘Origin of Species,’ fifth edit. 1869, p. 104. I had\r\n  always perceived, that rare and strongly-marked deviations of\r\n  structure, deserving to be called monstrosities, could seldom\r\n  be preserved through natural selection, and that the\r\n  preservation of even highly-beneficial variations would depend\r\n  to a certain extent on chance. I had also fully appreciated the\r\n  importance of mere individual differences, and this led me to\r\n  insist so strongly on the importance of that unconscious form\r\n  of selection by man, which follows from the preservation of the\r\n  most valued individuals of each breed, without any intention on\r\n  his part to modify the characters of the breed. But until I\r\n  read an able article in the ‘North British Review’ (March,\r\n  1867, p. 289, _et seq._), which has been of more use to me than\r\n  any other Review, I did not see how great the chances were\r\n  against the preservation of variations, whether slight or\r\n  strongly pronounced, occurring only in single individuals.\r\n\r\n  [180] ‘Introduct. to the Trochilidæ,’ p. 102.\r\n\r\n  [181] Gould, ‘Handbook of Birds of Australia,’ vol. ii. p. 32\r\n  and 68.\r\n\r\n  [182] Audubon, ‘Ornitholog.

Mr. T. W. Wood, who has the\r\n  experienced eye of an artist, asserts (‘Field,’ Newspaper, May\r\n  28, 1870, p. 457) that this is the case; but after carefully\r\n  examining two mounted specimens (the proper feathers from one\r\n  having been given to me by Mr. Gould for more accurate\r\n  comparison) I cannot perceive that this acme of perfection in\r\n  the shading has been attained; nor can others to whom I have\r\n  shewn these feathers recognise the fact.\r\n\r\n  [196] ‘The Reign of Law,’ 1867, p. 247.\r\n\r\n  [197] ‘Introduction to the Trochilidæ,’ 1861, p. 110.\r\n\r\n  [198] Fourth edition, 1866, p. 241.\r\n\r\n  [199] ‘Westminster Review,’ July, 1867. ‘Journal of Travel,’\r\n  vol. i. 1868, p. 73.\r\n\r\n  [200] Temminck says that the tail of the female _Phasianus\r\n  Sœmmerringii_ is only six inches long, ‘Planches\r\n  coloriées,’ vol. v. 1838, p. 487 and 488: the measurements\r\n  above given were made for me by Mr. Sclater.

Many other instances of\r\n  highly conspicuous females could be given. See Mr. Gould’s\r\n  magnificent work on this family.\r\n\r\n  [210] Mr. Salvin noticed in Guatemala (‘Ibis,’ 1864, p. 375)\r\n  that humming-birds were much more unwilling to leave their\r\n  nests during very hot weather, when the sun was shining\r\n  brightly, than during cool, cloudy, or rainy weather.\r\n\r\n  [211] I may specify, as instances of obscurely-coloured birds\r\n  building concealed nests, the species belonging to eight\r\n  Australian genera, described in Gould’s ‘Handbook of the Birds\r\n  of Australia,’ vol. i. p. 340, 362, 365, 383, 387, 389, 391,\r\n  414.\r\n\r\n  [212] Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. p. 244.\r\n\r\n  [213] On the nidification and colours of these latter species,\r\n  see Gould’s ‘Handbook,’ &c., vol. i. p. 504, 527.\r\n\r\n  [214] I have consulted, on this subject, Macgillivray’s\r\n  ‘British Birds,’ and though doubts may be entertained in some\r\n  cases in regard to the degree of concealment of the nest, and\r\n  of the degree of conspicuousness of the female, yet the\r\n  following birds, which all lay their eggs in holes or in domed\r\n  nests, can hardly be considered, according to the above\r\n  standard, as conspicuous: Passer, 2 species; Sturnus, of which\r\n  the female is considerably less brilliant than the male;\r\n  Cinclus; Motacilla boarula (?); Erithacus (?); Fruticola, 2\r\n  sp.; Saxicola; Ruticilla, 2 sp.; Sylvia, 3 sp.; Parus, 3 sp.;\r\n  Mecistura; Anorthura; Certhia; Sitta; Yunx; Muscicapa, 2 sp.;\r\n  Hirundo, 3 sp.; and Cypselus. The females of the following 12\r\n  birds may be considered as conspicuous according to the same\r\n  standard, viz., Pastor, Motacilla alba, Parus major and P.\r\n  cæruleus, Upupa, Picus, 4 sp., Coracias, Alcedo, and Merops.\r\n\r\n  [215] ‘Journal of Travel,’ edited by A.

In\r\n  some species of Dacelo the males have blue tails, and the\r\n  females brown ones; and Mr. R. B. Sharpe informs me that the\r\n  tail of the young male of _D.

W. Bennett, in ‘Land and Water,’\r\n  May, 1868, p. 233.\r\n\r\n  [252] Mr. Sclater, on the incubation of the Struthiones, ‘Proc.\r\n  Zoo.

For the Climacteris and\r\n  nightjar (Eurostopodus), see Gould’s ‘Handbook of the Birds of\r\n  Australia,’ vol. i. p. 602 and 97. The New Zealand shieldrake\r\n  (_Tadorna variegata_) offers a quite anomalous case: the head\r\n  of the female is pure white, and her back is redder than that\r\n  of the male; the head of the male is of a rich dark bronzed\r\n  colour, and his back is clothed with finely pencilled\r\n  slate-coloured feathers, so that he may altogether be\r\n  considered as the more beautiful of the two. He is larger and\r\n  more pugnacious than the female, and does not sit on the eggs.\r\n  So that in all these respects this species comes under our\r\n  first class of cases; but Mr. Sclater (‘Proc. Zool. Soc.’ 1866,\r\n  p. 150) was much surprised to observe that the young of both\r\n  sexes, when about three months old, resembled in their dark\r\n  heads and necks the adult males, instead of the adult females;\r\n  so that it would appear in this case that the females have been\r\n  modified, whilst the males and the young have retained a former\r\n  state of plumage.\r\n\r\n  [254] Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 598.\r\n\r\n  [255] Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. p. 222, 228.

The young of the Polish swan, _Cygnus immutabilis_ of\r\n  Yarrell, are always white; but this species, as Mr. Sclater\r\n  informs me, is believed to be nothing more than a variety of\r\n  the Domestic Swan (_Cygnus olor_).\r\n\r\n  [261] I am indebted to Mr. Blyth for information in regard to\r\n  this genus. The sparrow of Palestine belongs to the sub-genus\r\n  Petronia.\r\n\r\n  [262] For instance, the males of _Tanagra æstiva_ and\r\n  _Fringilla cyanea_ require three years, the male of _Fringilla\r\n  ciris_ four years, to complete their beautiful plumage. (See\r\n  Audubon, ‘Ornith. Biography,’ vol. i. p. 233, 280, 378.) The\r\n  Harlequin duck takes three years (ibid. vol. iii. p. 614). The\r\n  male of the Gold pheasant, as I hear from Mr. J. Jenner Weir,\r\n  can be distinguished from the female when about three months\r\n  old, but he does not acquire his full splendour until the end\r\n  of the September in the following year.\r\n\r\n  [263] Thus the _Ibis tantalus_ and _Grus Americanus_ take four\r\n  years, the Flamingo several years, and the _Ardea Ludovicana_\r\n  two years, before they acquire their perfect plumage. See\r\n  Audubon, ibid. vol. i. p. 221; vol. iii. p. 133, 139, 211.\r\n\r\n  [264] Mr. Blyth, in Charlesworth’s ‘Mag. of Nat. Hist.’ vol. i.\r\n  1837, p. 300. Mr. Bartlett has informed me in regard to\r\n  gold-pheasants.\r\n\r\n  [265] I have noticed the following cases in Audubon’s ‘Ornith.\r\n  Biography. The Redstart of America’ (_Muscicapa ruticilla_,\r\n  vol. i. p. 203). The _Ibis tantalus_ takes four years to come\r\n  to full maturity, but sometimes breeds in the second year (vol.\r\n  iii. p. 133). The _Grus Americanus_ takes the same time, but\r\n  breeds before acquiring its full plumage (vol. iii. p. 211).\r\n  The adults of _Ardea cærulea_ are blue and the young white; and\r\n  white, mottled, and mature blue birds may all be seen breeding\r\n  together (vol. iv. p. 58): but Mr. Blyth informs me that\r\n  certain herons apparently are dimorphic, for white and coloured\r\n  individuals of the same age may be observed. The Harlequin duck\r\n  (_Anas histrionica_, Linn.) takes three years to acquire its\r\n  full plumage, though many birds breed in the second year (vol.\r\n  iii. p. 614). The White-headed Eagle (_Falco leucocephalus_,\r\n  vol. iii. p. 210) is likewise known to breed in its immature\r\n  state. Some species of Oriolus (according to Mr. Blyth and Mr.\r\n  Swinhoe, in ‘Ibis,’ July, 1863, p. 68) likewise breed before\r\n  they attain their full plumage.\r\n\r\n  [266] See the last footnote.\r\n\r\n  [267] Other animals, belonging to quite distinct classes, are\r\n  either habitually or occasionally capable of breeding before\r\n  they have fully acquired their adult characters. This is the\r\n  case with the young males of the salmon. Several amphibians\r\n  have been known to breed whilst retaining their larval\r\n  structure. Fritz Müller has shewn (‘Facts and Arguments for\r\n  Darwin,’ Eng. trans. 1869, p. 79) that the males of several\r\n  amphipod crustaceans become sexually mature whilst young; and I\r\n  infer that this is a case of premature breeding, because they\r\n  have not as yet acquired their fully-developed claspers. All\r\n  such facts are highly interesting, as bearing on one means by\r\n  which species may undergo great modifications of character, in\r\n  accordance with Mr. Cope’s views, expressed under the terms of\r\n  the “retardation and acceleration of generic characters;” but I\r\n  cannot follow the views of this eminent naturalist to their\r\n  full extent. See Mr. Cope, “On the Origin of Genera,” from the\r\n  ‘Proc. of Acad. Nat. Sc. of Philadelphia,’ Oct. 1868.\r\n\r\n  [268] Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. iii. p. 507, on the\r\n  peacock.

Wright, in ‘Ibis,’ vol. vi. 1864, p. 65.\r\n  Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’ vol. i. p. 515.\r\n\r\n  [277] The following additional cases may be mentioned: the\r\n  young males of _Tanagra rubra_ can be distinguished from the\r\n  young females (Audubon, ‘Ornith. Biography,’ vol. iv. p. 392),\r\n  and so it is with the nestlings of a blue nuthatch,\r\n  _Dendrophila frontalis_ of India (Jerdon, ‘Birds of India,’\r\n  vol. i. p. 389). Mr. Blyth also informs me that the sexes of\r\n  the stonechat, _Saxicola rubicola_, are distinguishable at a\r\n  very early age.\r\n\r\n  [278] ‘Westminster Review,’ July, 1867, p. 5.\r\n\r\n  [279] ‘Ibis,’ 1859, vol. i. p. 429, _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [280] No satisfactory explanation has ever been offered of the\r\n  immense size, and still less of the bright colours, of the\r\n  toucan’s beak. Mr. Bates (‘The Naturalist on the Amazons,’ vol.\r\n  ii. 1863, p. 341) states that they use their beak for reaching\r\n  fruit at the extreme tips of the branches; and likewise, as\r\n  stated by other authors, for extracting eggs and young birds\r\n  from the nests of other birds. But as Mr. Bates admits, the\r\n  beak “can scarcely be considered a very perfectly-formed\r\n  instrument for the end to which it is applied.” The great bulk\r\n  of the beak, as shewn by its breadth, depth, as well as length,\r\n  is not intelligible on the view, that it serves merely as an\r\n  organ of prehension.\r\n\r\n  [281] Ramphastos carinatus, Gould’s ‘Monograph of Ramphastidæ.’\r\n\r\n  [282] On Larus, Gavia, and Sterna, see Macgillivray, ‘Hist.\r\n  Brit.

On\r\n  the Anastomus, Mr. Blyth, in ‘Ibis,’ 1867, p. 173.\r\n\r\n  [283] It may be noticed that with vultures, which roam far and\r\n  wide through the higher regions of the atmosphere, like marine\r\n  birds over the ocean, three or four species are almost wholly\r\n  or largely white, and many other species are black. This fact\r\n  supports the conjecture that these conspicuous colours may aid\r\n  the sexes in finding each other during the breeding-season.\r\n\r\n  [284] ‘The Journal of Travel,’ edited by A. Murray, vol. i.\r\n  1868, p. 286.\r\n\r\n  [285] See Jerdon on the genus Palæornis, ‘Birds of India,’ vol.\r\n  i. p. 258-260.\r\n\r\n  [286] The young of _Ardea rufescens_ and _A. cærulea_ of the\r\n  U. States are likewise white, the adults being coloured in\r\n  accordance with their specific names. Audubon (‘Ornith.\r\n  Biography,’ vol. iii. p. 416; vol. iv. p. 58) seems rather\r\n  pleased at the thought that this remarkable change of plumage\r\n  will greatly “disconcert the systematists.”\r\n\r\n  [287] I am greatly indebted to the kindness of Mr. Sclater for\r\n  having looked over these four chapters on birds, and the two\r\n  following ones on mammals. By this means I have been saved from\r\n  making mistakes about the names of the species, and from giving\r\n  any facts which are actually known to this distinguished\r\n  naturalist to be erroneous. But of course he is not at all\r\n  answerable for the accuracy of the statements quoted by me from\r\n  various authorities.\r\n\r\n  [288] See Waterton’s account of two hares fighting,\r\n  ‘Zoologist,’ vol. i. 1843, p. 211.

Smith\r\n  found at the Cape of Good Hope the skeletons of two gnus in the\r\n  same condition.\r\n\r\n  [291] Mr. Lamont (‘Seasons with the Sea-Horses,’ 1861, p. 143)\r\n  says that a good tusk of the male walrus weighs 4 pounds, and\r\n  is longer than that of the female, which weighs about 3 pounds.\r\n  The males are described as fighting ferociously.

This,\r\n  however, occurred in an aged and confined _Macacus cynomolgus_,\r\n  whose moustaches were “remarkably long and human-like.”\r\n  Altogether this old monkey presented a ludicrous resemblance to\r\n  one of the reigning monarchs of Europe, after whom he was\r\n  universally nick-named. In certain races of man the hair on the\r\n  head hardly ever becomes grey; thus Mr. D. Forbes has never\r\n  seen, as he informs me, an instance with the Aymaras and\r\n  Quechuas of S.

Stuart Mill remarks (‘The Subjection of Women,’ 1869,\r\n  p. 122), “the things in which man most excels woman are those\r\n  which require most plodding, and long hammering at single\r\n  thoughts.” What is this but energy and perseverance?\r\n\r\n  [401] An observation by Vogt bears on this subject: he says, it\r\n  is a “remarkable circumstance, that the difference between the\r\n  sexes, as regards the cranial cavity, increases with the\r\n  development of the race, so that the male European excels much\r\n  more the female, than the negro the negress. Welcker confirms\r\n  this statement of Huschke from his measurements of negro and\r\n  German skulls.” But Vogt admits (‘Lectures on Man,’ Eng.\r\n  translat. 1864, p. 81) that more observations are requisite on\r\n  this point.\r\n\r\n  [402] Owen, ‘Anatomy of Vertebrates,’ vol. iii. p. 603.\r\n\r\n  [403] ‘Journal of the Anthropolog.

Review,’\r\n  Oct. 1870, page 293), who, in discussing the above subject,\r\n  remarks, “There are many consequences of the ultimate laws or\r\n  uniformities of nature through which the acquisition of one\r\n  useful power will bring with it many resulting advantages as\r\n  well as limiting disadvantages, actual or possible, which the\r\n  principle of utility may not have comprehended in its action.”\r\n  This principle has an important bearing, as I have attempted to\r\n  shew in the second chapter of this work, on the acquisition by\r\n  man of some of his mental characteristics.\r\n\r\n  [410] See the very interesting discussion on the Origin and\r\n  Function of Music, by Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his collected\r\n  ‘Essays,’ 1858, p. 359. Mr. Spencer comes to an exactly\r\n  opposite conclusion to that at which I have arrived. He\r\n  concludes that the cadences used in emotional speech afford the\r\n  foundation from which music has been developed; whilst I\r\n  conclude that musical notes and rhythm were first acquired by\r\n  the male or female progenitors of mankind for the sake of\r\n  charming the opposite sex. Thus musical tones became firmly\r\n  associated with some of the strongest passions an animal is\r\n  capable of feeling, and are consequently used instinctively, or\r\n  through association, when strong emotions are expressed in\r\n  speech. Mr. Spencer does not offer any satisfactory\r\n  explanation, nor can I, why high or deep notes should be\r\n  expressive, both with man and the lower animals, of certain\r\n  emotions. Mr. Spencer gives also an interesting discussion on\r\n  the relations between poetry, recitative, and song.\r\n\r\n  [411] Rengger, ‘Säugethiere von Paraguay,’ s. 49.\r\n\r\n  [412] See an interesting discussion on this subject by Häckel,\r\n  ‘Generelle Morph.’ B. ii. 1866, s. 246.\r\n\r\n  [413] A full and excellent account of the manner in which\r\n  savages in all parts of the world ornament themselves is given\r\n  by the Italian traveller, Prof. Mantegazza, ‘Rio de la Plata,\r\n  Viaggi e Studi,’ 1867, p. 525-545; all the following\r\n  statements, when other references are not given, are taken from\r\n  this work.

Mr. Wallace believes (p. 350) “that some intelligent\r\n  power has guided or determined the development of man;” and he\r\n  considers the hairless condition of the skin as coming under\r\n  this head. The Rev. T. R. Stebbing, in commenting on this view\r\n  (‘Transactions of Devonshire Assoc. for Science,’ 1870)\r\n  remarks, that had Mr. Wallace “employed his usual ingenuity on\r\n  the question of man’s hairless skin, he might have seen the\r\n  possibility of its selection through its superior beauty or the\r\n  health attaching to superior cleanliness. At any rate it is\r\n  surprising that he should picture to himself a superior\r\n  intelligence plucking the hair from the backs of savage men (to\r\n  whom, according to his own account it would have been useful\r\n  and beneficial), in order that the descendants of the poor\r\n  shorn wretches might after many deaths from cold and damp in\r\n  the course of many generations,” have been forced to raise\r\n  themselves in the scale of civilisation through the practice of\r\n  various arts, in the manner indicated by Mr. Wallace.\r\n\r\n  [467] ‘The Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\n  Domestication,’ vol. ii. 1868, p. 327.\r\n\r\n  [468] ‘Investigations into Military and Anthropological\r\n  Statistics of American Soldiers,’ by B.

It should be particularly\r\n  observed, that pure blacks and mulattoes were included in the\r\n  above enumeration; and this is an unfortunate circumstance, as\r\n  in accordance with the principle, the truth of which I have\r\n  elsewhere proved, crossed races would be eminently liable to\r\n  revert to the primordial hairy character of their early\r\n  ape-like progenitors.\r\n\r\n  [469] “Ueber die Richtung der Haare am Menschlichen Körper,” in\r\n  Müller’s ‘Archiv für Anat. und Phys.’ 1837, s. 40.\r\n\r\n  [470] Mr. Sproat (‘Scenes and Studies of Savage Life,’ 1868, p.\r\n  25) suggests, with reference to the beardless natives of\r\n  Vancouver’s Island, that the custom of plucking out the hairs\r\n  on the face, “continued from one generation to another, would\r\n  perhaps at last produce a race distinguishable by a thin and\r\n  straggling growth of beard.” But the custom would not have\r\n  arisen until the beard had already become, from some\r\n  independent cause, greatly reduced. Nor have we any direct\r\n  evidence that the continued eradication of the hair would lead\r\n  to any inherited effect. Owing to this cause of doubt, I have\r\n  not hitherto alluded to the belief held by some distinguished\r\n  ethnologists, for instance M. Gosse of Geneva, that artificial\r\n  modifications of the skull tend to be inherited. I have no wish\r\n  to dispute this conclusion; and we now know from Dr.\r\n  Brown-Séquard’s remarkable observations, especially those\r\n  recently communicated (1870) to the British Association, that\r\n  with guinea-pigs the effects of operations are inherited.\r\n\r\n  [471] ‘Ueber die Richtung,’ ibid. s. 40.\r\n\r\n  [472] On the “Limits of Natural Selection,” in the ‘North\r\n  American Review,’ Oct. 1870, p. 295.\r\n\r\n  [473] The Rev.
