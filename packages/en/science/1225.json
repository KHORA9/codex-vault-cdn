This great\r\nmovement, the ultimate outcome of which is not to be foreseen, had its\r\norigin in the discoveries made by Michael Faraday, sixty-two years ago.\r\nFrom these discoveries have sprung applications of the telephone order,\r\ntogether with various forms of the electric telegraph. From them have\r\nsprung the extraordinary advances made in electrical illumination.\r\nFaraday could have had but an imperfect notion of the expansions of\r\nwhich his discoveries were capable. Still he had a vivid and strong\r\nimagination, and I do not doubt that he saw possibilities which did not\r\ndisclose themselves to the general scientific mind. He knew that his\r\ndiscoveries had their practical side, but he steadfastly resisted\r\nthe seductions of this side, applying himself to the development of\r\nprinciples; being well aware that the practical question would receive\r\ndue development hereafter.\r\n\r\nDuring my sojourn in Switzerland this year, I read through the proofs of\r\nthis new edition, and by my reading was confirmed in the conviction that\r\nthe book ought not to be suffered to go out of print. The memoir was\r\nwritten under great pressure, but I am not ashamed of it as it stands.\r\nGlimpses of Faraday's character and gleams of his discoveries are there\r\nto be found which will be of interest to humanity to the end of time.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall. Hind Head, December, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Note.--It was, I believe, my husband's intention to substitute\r\nthis Preface, written a few days before his death, for all former\r\nPrefaces. As, however, he had not the opportunity of revising the old\r\nprefatory pages himself, they have been allowed to remain just as they\r\nstood in the last edition.\r\n\r\nLouisa C. Tyndall.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to the fourth edition.\r\n\r\nWhen consulted a short time ago as to the republication of 'Faraday as a\r\nDiscoverer,' it seemed to me that the labours, and points of character,\r\nof so great a worker and so good a man should not be allowed to vanish\r\nfrom the public eye. I therefore willingly fell in with the proposal of\r\nmy Publishers to issue a new edition of the little book.\r\n\r\nRoyal Institution, February, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to the second edition.\r\n\r\nThe experimental researches of Faraday are so voluminous, their\r\ndescriptions are so detailed, and their wealth of illustration is so\r\ngreat, as to render it a heavy labour to master them. The multiplication\r\nof proofs, necessary and interesting when the new truths had to be\r\nestablished, are however less needful now when these truths have become\r\nhousehold words in science. I have therefore tried in the following\r\npages to compress the body, without injury to the spirit, of these\r\nimperishable investigations, and to present them in a form which should\r\nbe convenient and useful to the student of the present day.\r\n\r\nWhile I write, the volumes of the Life of Faraday by Dr. Bence Jones\r\nhave reached my hands. To them the reader must refer for an account of\r\nFaraday's private relations. A hasty glance at the work shows me that\r\nthe reverent devotion of the biographer has turned to admirable account\r\nthe materials at his command.\r\n\r\nThe work of Dr. Bence Jones enables me to correct a statement regarding\r\nWollaston's and Faraday's respective relations to the discovery of\r\nMagnetic Rotation. Wollaston's idea was to make the wire carrying a\r\ncurrent rotate round its own axis: an idea afterwards realised by the\r\ncelebrated Ampere. Faraday's discovery was to make the wire carrying the\r\ncurrent revolve round the pole of a magnet and the reverse.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall. Royal Institution: December, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARADAY AS A DISCOVERER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1.\r\n\r\n     Parentage: introduction to the royal institution: earliest\r\n     experiments: first royal society paper: marriage.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought desirable to give you and the world some image\r\nof MICHAEL FARADAY, as a scientific investigator and discoverer. The\r\nattempt to respond to this desire has been to me a labour of difficulty,\r\nif also a labour of love. For however well acquainted I may be with the\r\nresearches and discoveries of that great master--however numerous the\r\nillustrations which occur to me of the loftiness of Faraday's character\r\nand the beauty of his life--still to grasp him and his researches as a\r\nwhole; to seize upon the ideas which guided him, and connected them; to\r\ngain entrance into that strong and active brain, and read from it the\r\nriddle of the world--this is a work not easy of performance, and all but\r\nimpossible amid the distraction of duties of another kind. That I should\r\nat one period or another speak to you regarding Faraday and his work is\r\nnatural, if not inevitable; but I did not expect to be called upon to\r\nspeak so soon. Still the bare suggestion that this is the fit and proper\r\ntime for speech sent me immediately to my task: from it I have returned\r\nwith such results as I could gather, and also with the wish that those\r\nresults were more worthy than they are of the greatness of my theme.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to lay before you a life of Faraday in the\r\nordinary acceptation of the term. The duty I have to perform is to give\r\nyou some notion of what he has done in the world; dwelling incidentally\r\non the spirit in which his work was executed, and introducing such\r\npersonal traits as may be necessary to the completion of your picture of\r\nthe philosopher, though by no means adequate to give you a complete idea\r\nof the man.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers have already informed you that Michael Faraday was born\r\nat Newington Butts, on September 22, 1791, and that he died at Hampton\r\nCourt, on August 25, 1867. Believing, as I do, in the general truth\r\nof the doctrine of hereditary transmission--sharing the opinion of Mr.\r\nCarlyle, that 'a really able man never proceeded from entirely stupid\r\nparents'--I once used the privilege of my intimacy with Mr. Faraday\r\nto ask him whether his parents showed any signs of unusual ability. He\r\ncould remember none. His father, I believe, was a great sufferer during\r\nthe latter years of his life, and this might have masked whatever\r\nintellectual power he possessed. When thirteen years old, that is to\r\nsay in 1804, Faraday was apprenticed to a bookseller and bookbinder in\r\nBlandford Street, Manchester Square: here he spent eight years of his\r\nlife, after which he worked as a journeyman elsewhere.\r\n\r\nYou have also heard the account of Faraday's first contact with the\r\nRoyal Institution; that he was introduced by one of the members to Sir\r\nHumphry Davy's last lectures, that he took notes of those lectures;\r\nwrote them fairly out, and sent them to Davy, entreating him at the\r\nsame time to enable him to quit trade, which he detested, and to pursue\r\nscience, which he loved. Davy was helpful to the young man, and this\r\nshould never be forgotten: he at once wrote to Faraday, and afterwards,\r\nwhen an opportunity occurred, made him his assistant.[1] Mr. Gassiot has\r\nlately favoured me with the following reminiscence of this time:--\r\n\r\n'Clapham Common, Surrey,\r\n\r\n'November 28, 1867.\r\n\r\n'My Dear Tyndall,--Sir H. Davy was accustomed to call on the late Mr.\r\nPepys, in the Poultry, on his way to the London Institution, of which\r\nPepys was one of the original managers; the latter told me that on one\r\noccasion Sir H. Davy, showing him a letter, said: \"Pepys, what am I\r\nto do, here is a letter from a young man named Faraday; he has been\r\nattending my lectures, and wants me to give him employment at the Royal\r\nInstitution--what can I do?\" \"Do?\" replied Pepys, \"put him to wash\r\nbottles; if he is good for anything he will do it directly, if he\r\nrefuses he is good for nothing.\" \"No, no,\" replied Davy; \"we must try\r\nhim with something better than that.\" The result was, that Davy engaged\r\nhim to assist in the Laboratory at weekly wages.\r\n\r\n'Davy held the joint office of Professor of Chemistry and Director of\r\nthe Laboratory; he ultimately gave up the former to the late Professor\r\nBrande, but he insisted that Faraday should be appointed Director of\r\nthe Laboratory, and, as Faraday told me, this enabled him on subsequent\r\noccasions to hold a definite position in the Institution, in which he\r\nwas always supported by Davy. I believe he held that office to the last.\r\n\r\n'Believe me, my dear Tyndall, yours truly,\r\n\r\n'J. P. Gassiot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Dr. Tyndall.'\r\n\r\nFrom a letter written by Faraday himself soon after his appointment as\r\nDavy's assistant, I extract the following account of his introduction to\r\nthe Royal Institution:--\r\n\r\n'London, Sept. 13, 1813.\r\n\r\n'As for myself, I am absent (from home) nearly day and night, except\r\noccasional calls, and it is likely shall shortly be absent entirely,\r\nbut this (having nothing more to say, and at the request of my mother) I\r\nwill explain to you. I was formerly a bookseller and binder, but am now\r\nturned philosopher,[2] which happened thus:--Whilst an apprentice, I,\r\nfor amusement, learnt a little chemistry and other parts of philosophy,\r\nand felt an eager desire to proceed in that way further. After being\r\na journeyman for six months, under a disagreeable master, I gave up\r\nmy business, and through the interest of a Sir H. Davy, filled the\r\nsituation of chemical assistant to the Royal Institution of Great\r\nBritain, in which office I now remain; and where I am constantly\r\nemployed in observing the works of nature, and tracing the manner in\r\nwhich she directs the order and arrangement of the world. I have lately\r\nhad proposals made to me by Sir Humphry Davy to accompany him in his\r\ntravels through Europe and Asia, as philosophical assistant. If I go at\r\nall I expect it will be in October next--about the end; and my absence\r\nfrom home will perhaps be as long as three years. But as yet all is\r\nuncertain.'\r\n\r\nThis account is supplemented by the following letter, written by Faraday\r\nto his friend De la Rive,[3] on the occasion of the death of Mrs.\r\nMarcet. The letter is dated September 2, 1858:--\r\n\r\n'My Dear Friend,--Your subject interested me deeply every way; for Mrs.\r\nMarcet was a good friend to me, as she must have been to many of the\r\nhuman race. I entered the shop of a bookseller and bookbinder at the age\r\nof thirteen, in the year 1804, remained there eight years, and during\r\nthe chief part of my time bound books. Now it was in those books, in the\r\nhours after work, that I found the beginning of my philosophy.\r\n\r\nThere were two that especially helped me, the \"Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica,\" from which I gained my first notions of electricity, and\r\nMrs. Marcet's \"Conversation on Chemistry,\" which gave me my foundation\r\nin that science.\r\n\r\n'Do not suppose that I was a very deep thinker, or was marked as a\r\nprecocious person. I was a very lively imaginative person, and could\r\nbelieve in the \"Arabian Nights\" as easily as in the \"Encyclopaedia.\"\r\nBut facts were important to me, and saved me. I could trust a fact, and\r\nalways cross-examined an assertion. So when I questioned Mrs. Marcet's\r\nbook by such little experiments as I could find means to perform, and\r\nfound it true to the facts as I could understand them, I felt that I\r\nhad got hold of an anchor in chemical knowledge, and clung fast to\r\nit. Thence my deep veneration for Mrs. Marcet--first as one who had\r\nconferred great personal good and pleasure on me; and then as one able\r\nto convey the truth and principle of those boundless fields of knowledge\r\nwhich concern natural things to the young, untaught, and inquiring mind.\r\n\r\n'You may imagine my delight when I came to know Mrs. Marcet personally;\r\nhow often I cast my thoughts backward, delighting to connect the\r\npast and the present; how often, when sending a paper to her as a\r\nthank-offering, I thought of my first instructress, and such like\r\nthoughts will remain with me.\r\n\r\n'I have some such thoughts even as regards your own father; who was,\r\nI may say, the first who personally at Geneva, and afterwards by\r\ncorrespondence, encouraged, and by that sustained me.'\r\n\r\nTwelve or thirteen years ago Mr. Faraday and myself quitted the\r\nInstitution one evening together, to pay a visit to our friend Grove in\r\nBaker Street. He took my arm at the door, and, pressing it to his\r\nside in his warm genial way, said, 'Come, Tyndall, I will now show you\r\nsomething that will interest you.' We walked northwards, passed the\r\nhouse of Mr. Babbage, which drew forth a reference to the famous evening\r\nparties once assembled there. We reached Blandford Street, and after a\r\nlittle looking about he paused before a stationer's shop, and then went\r\nin. On entering the shop, his usual animation seemed doubled; he looked\r\nrapidly at everything it contained. To the left on entering was a door,\r\nthrough which he looked down into a little room, with a window in front\r\nfacing Blandford Street. Drawing me towards him, he said eagerly, 'Look\r\nthere, Tyndall, that was my working-place. I bound books in that\r\nlittle nook.' A respectable-looking woman stood behind the counter: his\r\nconversation with me was too low to be heard by her, and he now turned\r\nto the counter to buy some cards as an excuse for our being there. He\r\nasked the woman her name--her predecessor's name--his predecessor's\r\nname. 'That won't do,' he said, with good-humoured impatience; 'who was\r\nhis predecessor?' 'Mr. Riebau,' she replied, and immediately added,\r\nas if suddenly recollecting herself, 'He, sir, was the master of Sir\r\nCharles Faraday.' 'Nonsense!' he responded, 'there is no such person.'\r\nGreat was her delight when I told her the name of her visitor; but\r\nshe assured me that as soon as she saw him running about the shop, she\r\nfelt-though she did not know why--that it must be 'Sir Charles Faraday.'\r\n\r\nFaraday did, as you know, accompany Davy to Rome: he was re-engaged\r\nby the managers of the Royal Institution on May 15, 1815. Here he made\r\nrapid progress in chemistry, and after a time was entrusted with easy\r\nanalyses by Davy. In those days the Royal Institution published 'The\r\nQuarterly Journal of Science,' the precursor of our own 'Proceedings.'\r\nFaraday's first contribution to science appeared in that journal in\r\n1816. It was an analysis of some caustic lime from Tuscany, which had\r\nbeen sent to Davy by the Duchess of Montrose. Between this period and\r\n1818 various notes and short papers were published by Faraday. In 1818\r\nhe experimented upon 'Sounding Flames.' Professor Auguste De la Rive\r\nhad investigated those sounding flames, and had applied to them an\r\nexplanation which completely accounted for a class of sounds discovered\r\nby himself, but did not account for those known to his predecessors. By\r\na few simple and conclusive experiments, Faraday proved the explanation\r\ninsufficient. It is an epoch in the life of a young man when he finds\r\nhimself correcting a person of eminence, and in Faraday's case, where\r\nits effect was to develop a modest self-trust, such an event could not\r\nfail to act profitably.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time between 1818 and 1820 Faraday published scientific\r\nnotes and notices of minor weight. At this time he was acquiring, not\r\nproducing; working hard for his master and storing and strengthening\r\nhis own mind. He assisted Mr. Brande in his lectures, and so quietly,\r\nskilfully, and modestly was his work done, that Mr. Brande's vocation at\r\nthe time was pronounced 'lecturing on velvet.' In 1820 Faraday published\r\na chemical paper 'on two new compounds of chlorine and carbon, and on\r\na new compound of iodine, carbon, and hydrogen.' This paper was read\r\nbefore the Royal Society on December 21, 1820, and it was the first of\r\nhis that was honoured with a place in the 'Philosophical Transactions.'\r\n\r\nOn June 12, 1821, he married, and obtained leave to bring his young wife\r\ninto his rooms at the Royal Institution. There for forty-six years\r\nthey lived together, occupying the suite of apartments which had been\r\npreviously in the successive occupancy of Young, Davy, and Brande. At\r\nthe time of her marriage Mrs. Faraday was twenty-one years of age, he\r\nbeing nearly thirty. Regarding this marriage I will at present limit\r\nmyself to quoting an entry written in Faraday's own hand in his book of\r\ndiplomas, which caught my eye while in his company some years ago. It\r\nran thus:--\r\n\r\n'25th January, 1847. 'Amongst these records and events, I here insert\r\nthe date of one which, as a source of honour and happiness, far exceeds\r\nall the rest. We were married on June 12, 1821.\r\n\r\n'M. Faraday.'\r\n\r\nThen follows the copy of the minutes, dated May 21, 1821, which gave him\r\nadditional rooms, and thus enabled him to bring his wife to the Royal\r\nInstitution. A feature of Faraday's character which I have often noticed\r\nmakes itself apparent in this entry. In his relations to his wife he\r\nadded chivalry to affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 1\r\n\r\n     [1] Here is Davy's recommendation of Faraday, presented to\r\n     the managers of the Royal Institution, at a meeting on the\r\n     18th of March, 1813, Charles Hatchett, Esq., in the chair:--\r\n\r\n     'Sir Humphry Davy has the honour to inform the managers that\r\n     he has found a person who is desirous to occupy the\r\n     situation in the Institution lately filled by William Payne.\r\n     His name is Michael Faraday. He is a youth of twenty-two\r\n     years of age.  As far as Sir H. Davy has been able to\r\n     observe or ascertain, he appears well fitted for the\r\n     situation.  His habits seem good; his disposition active and\r\n     cheerful, and his manner intelligent.  He is willing to\r\n     engage himself on the same terms as given to Mr. Payne at\r\n     the time of quitting the Institution.\r\n\r\n     'Resolved,--That Michael Faraday be engaged to fill the\r\n     situation lately occupied by Mr. Payne, on the same terms.'\r\n\r\n     [2] Faraday loved this word and employed it to the last; he\r\n     had an intense dislike to the modern term physicist.\r\n\r\n     [3] To whom I am indebted for a copy of the original letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2.\r\n\r\n     Early researches: magnetic rotations: liquefaction of gases:\r\n     heavy glass: Charles Anderson: contributions to physics.\r\n\r\nOersted, in 1820, discovered the action of a voltaic current on a\r\nmagnetic needle; and immediately afterwards the splendid intellect of\r\nAmpere succeeded in showing that every magnetic phenomenon then known\r\nmight be reduced to the mutual action of electric currents. The subject\r\noccupied all men's thoughts: and in this country Dr. Wollaston sought\r\nto convert the deflection of the needle by the current into a permanent\r\nrotation of the needle round the current. He also hoped to produce the\r\nreciprocal effect of causing a current to rotate round a magnet. In\r\nthe early part of 1821, Wollaston attempted to realise this idea in\r\nthe presence of Sir Humphry Davy in the laboratory of the Royal\r\nInstitution.[1] This was well calculated to attract Faraday's attention\r\nto the subject. He read much about it; and in the months of July,\r\nAugust, and September he wrote a 'history of the progress of\r\nelectro-magnetism,' which he published in Thomson's 'Annals of\r\nPhilosophy.' Soon afterwards he took up the subject of 'Magnetic\r\nRotations,' and on the morning of Christmas-day, 1821, he called his\r\nwife to witness, for the first time, the revolution of a magnetic needle\r\nround an electric current. Incidental to the 'historic sketch,' he\r\nrepeated almost all the experiments there referred to; and these, added\r\nto his own subsequent work, made him practical master of all that was\r\nthen known regarding the voltaic current. In 1821, he also touched\r\nupon a subject which subsequently received his closer attention--the\r\nvaporization of mercury at common temperatures; and immediately\r\nafterwards conducted, in company with Mr. Stodart, experiments on the\r\nalloys of steel. He was accustomed in after years to present to his\r\nfriends razors formed from one of the alloys then discovered.\r\n\r\nDuring Faraday's hours of liberty from other duties, he took up subjects\r\nof inquiry for himself; and in the spring of 1823, thus self-prompted,\r\nhe began the examination of a substance which had long been regarded as\r\nthe chemical element chlorine, in a solid form, but which Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, in 1810, had proved to be a hydrate of chlorine, that is, a\r\ncompound of chlorine and water. Faraday first analysed this hydrate, and\r\nwrote out an account of its composition. This account was looked over\r\nby Davy, who suggested the heating of the hydrate under pressure in a\r\nsealed glass tube. This was done. The hydrate fused at a blood-heat, the\r\ntube became filled with a yellow atmosphere, and was afterwards found\r\nto contain two liquid substances. Dr. Paris happened to enter the\r\nlaboratory while Faraday was at work. Seeing the oily liquid in his\r\ntube, he rallied the young chemist for his carelessness in employing\r\nsoiled vessels. On filing off the end of the tube, its contents exploded\r\nand the oily matter vanished. Early next morning, Dr. Paris received the\r\nfollowing note:--\r\n\r\n'Dear Sir,--The oil you noticed yesterday turns out to be liquid\r\nchlorine.\r\n\r\n'Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n'M. Faraday.'[2]\r\n\r\nThe gas had been liquefied by its own pressure. Faraday then tried\r\ncompression with a syringe, and succeeded thus in liquefying the gas.\r\n\r\nTo the published account of this experiment Davy added the following\r\nnote:--'In desiring Mr. Faraday to expose the hydrate of chlorine in\r\na closed glass tube, it occurred to me that one of three things would\r\nhappen: that decomposition of water would occur;... or that the chlorine\r\nwould separate in a fluid state.' Davy, moreover, immediately applied\r\nthe method of self-compressing atmosphere to the liquefaction of\r\nmuriatic gas. Faraday continued the experiments, and succeeded in\r\nreducing a number of gases till then deemed permanent to the liquid\r\ncondition. In 1844 he returned to the subject, and considerably expanded\r\nits limits. These important investigations established the fact\r\nthat gases are but the vapours of liquids possessing a very low\r\nboiling-point, and gave a sure basis to our views of molecular\r\naggregation. The account of the first investigation was read before the\r\nRoyal Society on April 10, 1823, and was published, in Faraday's name,\r\nin the 'Philosophical Transactions.' The second memoir was sent to\r\nthe Royal Society on December 19, 1844. I may add that while he was\r\nconducting his first experiments on the liquefaction of gases, thirteen\r\npieces of glass were on one occasion driven by an explosion into\r\nFaraday's eye.\r\n\r\nSome small notices and papers, including the observation that glass\r\nreadily changes colour in sunlight, follow here. In 1825 and 1826\r\nFaraday published papers in the 'Philosophical Transactions' on 'new\r\ncompounds of carbon and hydrogen,' and on 'sulphonaphthalic acid.' In\r\nthe former of these papers he announced the discovery of Benzol, which,\r\nin the hands of modern chemists, has become the foundation of our\r\nsplendid aniline dyes. But he swerved incessantly from chemistry into\r\nphysics; and in 1826 we find him engaged in investigating the limits\r\nof vaporization, and showing, by exceedingly strong and apparently\r\nconclusive arguments, that even in the case of mercury such a limit\r\nexists; much more he conceived it to be certain that our atmosphere does\r\nnot contain the vapour of the fixed constituents of the earth's crust.\r\nThis question, I may say, is likely to remain an open one. Dr. Rankine,\r\nfor example, has lately drawn attention to the odour of certain metals;\r\nwhence comes this odour, if it be not from the vapour of the metal?\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Faraday became a member of a committee, to which Sir John\r\nHerschel and Mr. Dollond also belonged, appointed by the Royal Society\r\nto examine, and if possible improve, the manufacture of glass for\r\noptical purposes. Their experiments continued till 1829, when the\r\naccount of them constituted the subject of a 'Bakerian Lecture.' This\r\nlectureship, founded in 1774 by Henry Baker, Esq., of the Strand,\r\nLondon, provides that every year a lecture shall be given before the\r\nRoyal Society, the sum of four pounds being paid to the lecturer. The\r\nBakerian Lecture, however, has long since passed from the region of\r\npay to that of honour, papers of mark only being chosen for it by\r\nthe council of the Society. Faraday's first Bakerian Lecture, 'On the\r\nManufacture of Glass for Optical Purposes,' was delivered at the\r\nclose of 1829. It is a most elaborate and conscientious description of\r\nprocesses, precautions, and results: the details were so exact and\r\nso minute, and the paper consequently so long, that three successive\r\nsittings of the Royal Society were taken up by the delivery of the\r\nlecture.[3] This glass did not turn out to be of important practical\r\nuse, but it happened afterwards to be the foundation of two of Faraday's\r\ngreatest discoveries.[4]\r\n\r\nThe experiments here referred to were commenced at the Falcon Glass\r\nWorks, on the premises of Messrs. Green and Pellatt, but Faraday could\r\nnot conveniently attend to them there. In 1827, therefore, a furnace was\r\nerected in the yard of the Royal Institution; and it was at this time,\r\nand with a view of assisting him at the furnace, that Faraday engaged\r\nSergeant Anderson, of the Royal Artillery, the respectable, truthful,\r\nand altogether trustworthy man whose appearance here is so fresh in our\r\nmemories. Anderson continued to be the reverential helper of Faraday and\r\nthe faithful servant of this Institution for nearly forty years.[5]\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Faraday published a paper, 'On a peculiar class of Optical\r\nDeceptions,' to which I believe the beautiful optical toy called the\r\nChromatrope owes its origin. In the same year he published a paper on\r\nVibrating Surfaces, in which he solved an acoustical problem which,\r\nthough of extreme simplicity when solved, appears to have baffled many\r\neminent men. The problem was to account for the fact that light bodies,\r\nsuch as the seed of lycopodium, collected at the vibrating parts of\r\nsounding plates, while sand ran to the nodal lines. Faraday showed that\r\nthe light bodies were entangled in the little whirlwinds formed in the\r\nair over the places of vibration, and through which the heavier sand\r\nwas readily projected. Faraday's resources as an experimentalist were so\r\nwonderful, and his delight in experiment was so great, that he sometimes\r\nalmost ran into excess in this direction. I have heard him say that this\r\npaper on vibrating surfaces was too heavily laden with experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 2\r\n\r\n     [1] The reader's attention is directed to the concluding\r\n     paragraph of the 'Preface to the Second Edition written in\r\n     December, 1869.

It\r\n     was somewhere in the year 1822, as well as I can recollect,\r\n     that I mentioned it to Sir James (then Mr.) South; and, in\r\n     consequence, the trial was made in his laboratory in\r\n     Blackman Street, by precipitating and working a large\r\n     quantity of borate of lead, and fusing it under a muffle in\r\n     a porcelain evaporating dish.  A very limpid (though\r\n     slightly yellow) glass resulted, the refractive index 1.866!\r\n     (which you will find set down in my table of refractive\r\n     indices in my article \"Light,\" Encyclopaedia Metropolitana).\r\n     It was, however, too soft for optical use as an object-\r\n     glass.  This Faraday overcame, at least to a considerable\r\n     degree, by the introduction of silica.'\r\n\r\n     [5] Regarding Anderson, Faraday writes thus in 1845:--'I\r\n     cannot resist the occasion that is thus offered to me of\r\n     mentioning the name of Mr. Anderson, who came to me as an\r\n     assistant in the glass experiments, and has remained ever\r\n     since in the laboratory of the Royal Institution.

He had been engaged within these walls for eighteen years.\r\nDuring part of the time he had drunk in knowledge from Davy, and during\r\nthe remainder he continually exercised his capacity for independent\r\ninquiry. In 1831 we have him at the climax of his intellectual strength,\r\nforty years of age, stored with knowledge and full of original power.\r\nThrough reading, lecturing, and experimenting, he had become thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with electrical science: he saw where light was needed and\r\nexpansion possible. The phenomena of ordinary electric induction\r\nbelonged, as it were, to the alphabet of his knowledge: he knew that\r\nunder ordinary circumstances the presence of an electrified body was\r\nsufficient to excite, by induction, an unelectrified body. He knew that\r\nthe wire which carried an electric current was an electrified body, and\r\nstill that all attempts had failed to make it excite in other wires a\r\nstate similar to its own.\r\n\r\nWhat was the reason of this failure? Faraday never could work from the\r\nexperiments of others, however clearly described. He knew well that\r\nfrom every experiment issues a kind of radiation, luminous in different\r\ndegrees to different minds, and he hardly trusted himself to reason upon\r\nan experiment that he had not seen. In the autumn of 1831 he began to\r\nrepeat the experiments with electric currents, which, up to that time,\r\nhad produced no positive result. And here, for the sake of younger\r\ninquirers, if not for the sake of us all, it is worth while to dwell for\r\na moment on a power which Faraday possessed in an extraordinary degree.\r\nHe united vast strength with perfect flexibility. His momentum was that\r\nof a river, which combines weight and directness with the ability to\r\nyield to the flexures of its bed. The intentness of his vision in any\r\ndirection did not apparently diminish his power of perception in other\r\ndirections; and when he attacked a subject, expecting results he had the\r\nfaculty of keeping his mind alert, so that results different from those\r\nwhich he expected should not escape him through preoccupation.\r\n\r\nHe began his experiments 'on the induction of electric currents' by\r\ncomposing a helix of two insulated wires which were wound side by side\r\nround the same wooden cylinder. One of these wires he connected with\r\na voltaic battery of ten cells, and the other with a sensitive\r\ngalvanometer. When connection with the battery was made, and while the\r\ncurrent flowed, no effect whatever was observed at the galvanometer. But\r\nhe never accepted an experimental result, until he had applied to it the\r\nutmost power at his command. He raised his battery from 10 cells to 120\r\ncells, but without avail. The current flowed calmly through the battery\r\nwire without producing, during its flow, any sensible result upon the\r\ngalvanometer.\r\n\r\n'During its flow,' and this was the time when an effect was\r\nexpected--but here Faraday's power of lateral vision, separating, as it\r\nwere, from the line of expectation, came into play--he noticed that a\r\nfeeble movement of the needle always occurred at the moment when he made\r\ncontact with the battery; that the needle would afterwards return to\r\nits former position and remain quietly there unaffected by the flowing\r\ncurrent. At the moment, however, when the circuit was interrupted the\r\nneedle again moved, and in a direction opposed to that observed on the\r\ncompletion of the circuit.\r\n\r\nThis result, and others of a similar kind, led him to the conclusion\r\n'that the battery current through the one wire did in reality induce a\r\nsimilar current through the other; but that it continued for an instant\r\nonly, and partook more of the nature of the electric wave from a common\r\nLeyden jar than of the current from a voltaic battery.' The momentary\r\ncurrents thus generated were called induced currents, while the current\r\nwhich generated them was called the inducing current. It was immediately\r\nproved that the current generated at making the circuit was always\r\nopposed in direction to its generator, while that developed on the\r\nrupture of the circuit coincided in direction with the inducing current.\r\nIt appeared as if the current on its first rush through the primary wire\r\nsought a purchase in the secondary one, and, by a kind of kick, impelled\r\nbackward through the latter an electric wave, which subsided as soon as\r\nthe primary current was fully established.\r\n\r\nFaraday, for a time, believed that the secondary wire, though quiescent\r\nwhen the primary current had been once established, was not in its\r\nnatural condition, its return to that condition being declared by the\r\ncurrent observed at breaking the circuit. He called this hypothetical\r\nstate of the wire the electro-tonic state: he afterwards abandoned\r\nthis hypothesis, but seemed to return to it in later life. The term\r\nelectro-tonic is also preserved by Professor Du Bois Reymond to express\r\na certain electric condition of the nerves, and Professor Clerk Maxwell\r\nhas ably defined and illustrated the hypothesis in the Tenth Volume of\r\nthe 'Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.'\r\n\r\nThe mere approach of a wire forming a closed curve to a second wire\r\nthrough which a voltaic current flowed was then shown by Faraday to be\r\nsufficient to arouse in the neutral wire an induced current, opposed\r\nin direction to the inducing current; the withdrawal of the wire also\r\ngenerated a current having the same direction as the inducing current;\r\nthose currents existed only during the time of approach or withdrawal,\r\nand when neither the primary nor the secondary wire was in motion,\r\nno matter how close their proximity might be, no induced current was\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\nFaraday has been called a purely inductive philosopher. A great deal of\r\nnonsense is, I fear, uttered in this land of England about induction and\r\ndeduction. Some profess to befriend the one, some the other, while\r\nthe real vocation of an investigator, like Faraday, consists in the\r\nincessant marriage of both. He was at this time full of the theory of\r\nAmpere, and it cannot be doubted that numbers of his experiments were\r\nexecuted merely to test his deductions from that theory. Starting from\r\nthe discovery of Oersted, the illustrious French philosopher had shown\r\nthat all the phenomena of magnetism then known might be reduced to the\r\nmutual attractions and repulsions of electric currents. Magnetism had\r\nbeen produced from electricity, and Faraday, who all his life long\r\nentertained a strong belief in such reciprocal actions, now attempted to\r\neffect the evolution of electricity from magnetism. Round a welded iron\r\nring he placed two distinct coils of covered wire, causing the coils to\r\noccupy opposite halves of the ring. Connecting the ends of one of\r\nthe coils with a galvanometer, he found that the moment the ring\r\nwas magnetised, by sending a current through the other coil, the\r\ngalvanometer needle whirled round four or five times in succession. The\r\naction, as before, was that of a pulse, which vanished immediately.\r\nOn interrupting the circuit, a whirl of the needle in the opposite\r\ndirection occurred. It was only during the time of magnetization or\r\ndemagnetization that these effects were produced. The induced currents\r\ndeclared a change of condition only, and they vanished the moment the\r\nact of magnetization or demagnetization was complete.\r\n\r\nThe effects obtained with the welded ring were also obtained with\r\nstraight bars of iron. Whether the bars were magnetised by the electric\r\ncurrent, or were excited by the contact of permanent steel magnets,\r\ninduced currents were always generated during the rise, and during the\r\nsubsidence of the magnetism. The use of iron was then abandoned, and the\r\nsame effects were obtained by merely thrusting a permanent steel magnet\r\ninto a coil of wire. A rush of electricity through the coil accompanied\r\nthe insertion of the magnet; an equal rush in the opposite direction\r\naccompanied its withdrawal. The precision with which Faraday describes\r\nthese results, and the completeness with which he defines the boundaries\r\nof his facts, are wonderful. The magnet, for example, must not be passed\r\nquite through the coil, but only half through; for if passed wholly\r\nthrough, the needle is stopped as by a blow, and then he shows how this\r\nblow results from a reversal of the electric wave in the helix. He next\r\noperated with the powerful permanent magnet of the Royal Society, and\r\nobtained with it, in an exalted degree, all the foregoing phenomena.\r\n\r\nAnd now he turned the light of these discoveries upon the darkest\r\nphysical phenomenon of that day. Arago had discovered, in 1824, that\r\na disk of non-magnetic metal had the power of bringing a vibrating\r\nmagnetic needle suspended over it rapidly to rest; and that on causing\r\nthe disk to rotate the magnetic needle rotated along with it. When both\r\nwere quiescent, there was not the slightest measurable attraction or\r\nrepulsion exerted between the needle and the disk; still when in motion\r\nthe disk was competent to drag after it, not only a light needle, but\r\na heavy magnet. The question had been probed and investigated with\r\nadmirable skill both by Arago and Ampere, and Poisson had published a\r\ntheoretic memoir on the subject; but no cause could be assigned for so\r\nextraordinary an action. It had also been examined in this country by\r\ntwo celebrated men, Mr. Babbage and Sir John Herschel; but it still\r\nremained a mystery. Faraday always recommended the suspension of\r\njudgment in cases of doubt. 'I have always admired,' he says, 'the\r\nprudence and philosophical reserve shown by M. Arago in resisting the\r\ntemptation to give a theory of the effect he had discovered, so long\r\nas he could not devise one which was perfect in its application, and in\r\nrefusing to assent to the imperfect theories of others.' Now, however,\r\nthe time for theory had come. Faraday saw mentally the rotating disk,\r\nunder the operation of the magnet, flooded with his induced currents,\r\nand from the known laws of interaction between currents and magnets he\r\nhoped to deduce the motion observed by Arago. That hope he realised,\r\nshowing by actual experiment that when his disk rotated currents\r\npassed through it, their position and direction being such as must, in\r\naccordance with the established laws of electro-magnetic action, produce\r\nthe observed rotation.\r\n\r\nIntroducing the edge of his disk between the poles of the large\r\nhorseshoe magnet of the Royal Society, and connecting the axis and the\r\nedge of the disk, each by a wire with a galvanometer, he obtained, when\r\nthe disk was turned round, a constant flow of electricity. The direction\r\nof the current was determined by the direction of the motion, the\r\ncurrent being reversed when the rotation was reversed. He now states the\r\nlaw which rules the production of currents in both disks and wires, and\r\nin so doing uses, for the first time, a phrase which has since become\r\nfamous. When iron filings are scattered over a magnet, the particles\r\nof iron arrange themselves in certain determinate lines called magnetic\r\ncurves. In 1831, Faraday for the first time called these curves 'lines\r\nof magnetic force'; and he showed that to produce induced currents\r\nneither approach to nor withdrawal from a magnetic source, or centre, or\r\npole, was essential, but that it was only necessary to cut appropriately\r\nthe lines of magnetic force. Faraday's first paper on Magneto-electric\r\nInduction, which I have here endeavoured to condense, was read before\r\nthe Royal Society on the 24th of November, 1831.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 1832, he communicated to the Royal Society a second\r\npaper on Terrestrial Magneto-electric Induction, which was chosen as\r\nthe Bakerian Lecture for the year. He placed a bar of iron in a coil of\r\nwire, and lifting the bar into the direction of the dipping needle, he\r\nexcited by this action a current in the coil. On reversing the bar,\r\na current in the opposite direction rushed through the wire. The same\r\neffect was produced when, on holding the helix in the line of dip, a bar\r\nof iron was thrust into it. Here, however, the earth acted on the coil\r\nthrough the intermediation of the bar of iron. He abandoned the bar and\r\nsimply set a copper plate spinning in a horizontal plane; he knew that\r\nthe earth's lines of magnetic force then crossed the plate at an angle\r\nof about 70degrees. When the plate spun round, the lines of force were\r\nintersected and induced currents generated, which produced their proper\r\neffect when carried from the plate to the galvanometer. 'When the plate\r\nwas in the magnetic meridian, or in any other plane coinciding with\r\nthe magnetic dip, then its rotation produced no effect upon the\r\ngalvanometer.'\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of a mind fruitful in suggestions of a profound and\r\nphilosophic character--I mean that of Sir John Herschel--Mr. Barlow, of\r\nWoolwich, had experimented with a rotating iron shell. Mr. Christie had\r\nalso performed an elaborate series of experiments on a rotating iron\r\ndisk. Both of them had found that when in rotation the body exercised\r\na peculiar action upon the magnetic needle, deflecting it in a manner\r\nwhich was not observed during quiescence; but neither of them was aware\r\nat the time of the agent which produced this extraordinary deflection.\r\nThey ascribed it to some change in the magnetism of the iron shell and\r\ndisk.\r\n\r\nBut Faraday at once saw that his induced currents must come into play\r\nhere, and he immediately obtained them from an iron disk. With a hollow\r\nbrass ball, moreover, he produced the effects obtained by Mr. Barlow.\r\nIron was in no way necessary: the only condition of success was that\r\nthe rotating body should be of a character to admit of the formation of\r\ncurrents in its substance: it must, in other words, be a conductor of\r\nelectricity. The higher the conducting power the more copious were the\r\ncurrents. He now passes from his little brass globe to the globe of the\r\nearth. He plays like a magician with the earth's magnetism. He sees the\r\ninvisible lines along which its magnetic action is exerted, and sweeping\r\nhis wand across these lines evokes this new power. Placing a simple loop\r\nof wire round a magnetic needle he bends its upper portion to the west:\r\nthe north pole of the needle immediately swerves to the east: he bends\r\nhis loop to the east, and the north pole moves to the west. Suspending a\r\ncommon bar magnet in a vertical position, he causes it to spin round its\r\nown axis. Its pole being connected with one end of a galvanometer\r\nwire, and its equator with the other end, electricity rushes round the\r\ngalvanometer from the rotating magnet. He remarks upon the 'singular\r\nindependence' of the magnetism and the body of the magnet which carries\r\nit. The steel behaves as if it were isolated from its own magnetism.\r\n\r\nAnd then his thoughts suddenly widen, and he asks himself whether the\r\nrotating earth does not generate induced currents as it turns round its\r\naxis from west to east. In his experiment with the twirling magnet the\r\ngalvanometer wire remained at rest; one portion of the circuit was in\r\nmotion relatively to another portion. But in the case of the twirling\r\nplanet the galvanometer wire would necessarily be carried along with the\r\nearth; there would be no relative motion. What must be the consequence?\r\nTake the case of a telegraph wire with its two terminal plates dipped\r\ninto the earth, and suppose the wire to lie in the magnetic meridian.\r\nThe ground underneath the wire is influenced like the wire itself by the\r\nearth's rotation; if a current from south to north be generated in the\r\nwire, a similar current from south to north would be generated in the\r\nearth under the wire; these currents would run against the same terminal\r\nplate, and thus neutralise each other.\r\n\r\nThis inference appears inevitable, but his profound vision perceived\r\nits possible invalidity. He saw that it was at least possible that the\r\ndifference of conducting power between the earth and the wire might\r\ngive one an advantage over the other, and that thus a residual or\r\ndifferential current might be obtained. He combined wires of different\r\nmaterials, and caused them to act in opposition to each other, but\r\nfound the combination ineffectual. The more copious flow in the better\r\nconductor was exactly counterbalanced by the resistance of the worse.\r\nStill, though experiment was thus emphatic, he would clear his mind of\r\nall discomfort by operating on the earth itself. He went to the round\r\nlake near Kensington Palace, and stretched 480 feet of copper wire,\r\nnorth and south, over the lake, causing plates soldered to the wire\r\nat its ends to dip into the water. The copper wire was severed at the\r\nmiddle, and the severed ends connected with a galvanometer. No effect\r\nwhatever was observed. But though quiescent water gave no effect, moving\r\nwater might. He therefore worked at London Bridge for three days during\r\nthe ebb and flow of the tide, but without any satisfactory result. Still\r\nhe urges, 'Theoretically it seems a necessary consequence, that where\r\nwater is flowing there electric currents should be formed. If a line\r\nbe imagined passing from Dover to Calais through the sea, and returning\r\nthrough the land, beneath the water, to Dover, it traces out a circuit\r\nof conducting matter one part of which, when the water moves up or down\r\nthe channel, is cutting the magnetic curves of the earth, whilst the\r\nother is relatively at rest.... There is every reason to believe that\r\ncurrents do run in the general direction of the circuit described,\r\neither one way or the other, according as the passage of the waters is\r\nup or down the channel.' This was written before the submarine cable was\r\nthought of, and he once informed me that actual observation upon\r\nthat cable had been found to be in accordance with his theoretic\r\ndeduction.[1]\r\n\r\nThree years subsequent to the publication of these researches--that is\r\nto say, on January 29, 1835--Faraday read before the Royal Society\r\na paper 'On the influence by induction of an electric current upon\r\nitself.' A shock and spark of a peculiar character had been observed\r\nby a young man named William Jenkin, who must have been a youth of some\r\nscientific promise, but who, as Faraday once informed me, was dissuaded\r\nby his own father from having anything to do with science. The\r\ninvestigation of the fact noticed by Mr. Jenkin led Faraday to the\r\ndiscovery of the extra current, or the current induced in the primary\r\nwire itself at the moments of making and breaking contact, the phenomena\r\nof which he described and illustrated in the beautiful and exhaustive\r\npaper referred to.\r\n\r\nSeven-and-thirty years have passed since the discovery of\r\nmagneto-electricity; but, if we except the extra current, until quite\r\nrecently nothing of moment was added to the subject. Faraday entertained\r\nthe opinion that the discoverer of a great law or principle had a right\r\nto the 'spoils'--this was his term--arising from its illustration; and\r\nguided by the principle he had discovered, his wonderful mind, aided by\r\nhis wonderful ten fingers, overran in a single autumn this vast domain,\r\nand hardly left behind him the shred of a fact to be gathered by his\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nAnd here the question may arise in some minds, What is the use of\r\nit all? The answer is, that if man's intellectual nature thirsts for\r\nknowledge, then knowledge is useful because it satisfies this thirst. If\r\nyou demand practical ends, you must, I think, expand your definition of\r\nthe term practical, and make it include all that elevates and enlightens\r\nthe intellect, as well as all that ministers to the bodily health and\r\ncomfort of men. Still, if needed, an answer of another kind might be\r\ngiven to the question 'What is its use?' As far as electricity has been\r\napplied for medical purposes, it has been almost exclusively Faraday's\r\nelectricity. You have noticed those lines of wire which cross the\r\nstreets of London. It is Faraday's currents that speed from place to\r\nplace through these wires. Approaching the point of Dungeness, the\r\nmariner sees an unusually brilliant light, and from the noble phares\r\nof La Heve the same light flashes across the sea. These are Faraday's\r\nsparks exalted by suitable machinery to sunlike splendour. At the\r\npresent moment the Board of Trade and the Brethren of the Trinity House,\r\nas well as the Commissioners of Northern Lights, are contemplating the\r\nintroduction of the Magneto-electric Light at numerous points upon our\r\ncoasts; and future generations will be able to refer to those guiding\r\nstars in answer to the question. What has been the practical use of the\r\nlabours of Faraday? But I would again emphatically say, that his work\r\nneeds no such justification, and that if he had allowed his vision to\r\nbe disturbed by considerations regarding the practical use of his\r\ndiscoveries, those discoveries would never have been made by him. 'I\r\nhave rather,' he writes in 1831, 'been desirous of discovering new\r\nfacts and new relations dependent on magneto-electric induction, than\r\nof exalting the force of those already obtained; being assured that the\r\nlatter would find their full development hereafter.'\r\n\r\nIn 1817, when lecturing before a private society in London on the\r\nelement chlorine, Faraday thus expressed himself with reference to this\r\nquestion of utility. 'Before leaving this subject, I will point out the\r\nhistory of this substance, as an answer to those who are in the habit of\r\nsaying to every new fact. \"What is its use?\" Dr. Franklin says to such,\r\n\"What is the use of an infant?\" The answer of the experimentalist is,\r\n\"Endeavour to make it useful.\" When Scheele discovered this substance,\r\nit appeared to have no use; it was in its infancy and useless state, but\r\nhaving grown up to maturity, witness its powers, and see what endeavours\r\nto make it useful have done.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote to Chapter 3\r\n\r\n     [1] I am indebted to a friend for the following exquisite\r\n     morsel:--'A short time after the publication of Faraday's\r\n     first researches in magneto-electricity, he attended the\r\n     meeting of the British Association at Oxford, in 1832.  On\r\n     this occasion he was requested by some of the authorities to\r\n     repeat the celebrated experiment of eliciting a spark from a\r\n     magnet, employing for this purpose the large magnet in the\r\n     Ashmolean Museum.  To this he consented, and a large party\r\n     assembled to witness the experiments, which, I need not say,\r\n     were perfectly successful.  Whilst he was repeating them a\r\n     dignitary of the University entered the room, and addressing\r\n     himself to Professor Daniell, who was standing near Faraday,\r\n     inquired what was going on.  The Professor explained to him\r\n     as popularly as possible this striking result of Faraday's\r\n     great discovery. The Dean listened with attention and looked\r\n     earnestly at the brilliant spark, but a moment after he\r\n     assumed a serious countenance and shook his head; \"I am\r\n     sorry for it,\" said he, as he walked away; in the middle of\r\n     the room he stopped for a moment and repeated, \"I am sorry\r\n     for it:\" then walking towards the door, when the handle was\r\n     in his hand he turned round and said, \"Indeed I am sorry for\r\n     it; it is putting new arms into the hands of the\r\n     incendiary.\"  This occurred a short time after the papers\r\n     had been filled with the doings of the hayrick burners.  An\r\n     erroneous statement of what fell from the Dean's mouth was\r\n     printed at the time in one of the Oxford papers. He is there\r\n     wrongly stated to have said, \"It is putting new arms into\r\n     the hands of the infidel.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4.\r\n\r\n     Points of Character.\r\n\r\nA point highly illustrative of the character of Faraday now comes into\r\nview. He gave an account of his discovery of Magneto-electricity in a\r\nletter to his friend M. Hachette, of Paris, who communicated the letter\r\nto the Academy of Sciences. The letter was translated and published; and\r\nimmediately afterwards two distinguished Italian philosophers took up\r\nthe subject, made numerous experiments, and published their results\r\nbefore the complete memoirs of Faraday had met the public eye. This\r\nevidently irritated him. He reprinted the paper of the learned Italians\r\nin the 'Philosophical Magazine,' accompanied by sharp critical notes\r\nfrom himself. He also wrote a letter dated Dec. 1, 1832, to Gay Lussac,\r\nwho was then one of the editors of the 'Annales de Chimie,' in which\r\nhe analysed the results of the Italian philosophers, pointing out their\r\nerrors, and defending himself from what he regarded as imputations on\r\nhis character. The style of this letter is unexceptionable, for Faraday\r\ncould not write otherwise than as a gentleman; but the letter shows that\r\nhad he willed it he could have hit hard. We have heard much of Faraday's\r\ngentleness and sweetness and tenderness. It is all true, but it is very\r\nincomplete. You cannot resolve a powerful nature into these elements,\r\nand Faraday's character would have been less admirable than it was had\r\nit not embraced forces and tendencies to which the silky adjectives\r\n'gentle' and 'tender' would by no means apply. Underneath his sweetness\r\nand gentleness was the heat of a volcano. He was a man of excitable and\r\nfiery nature; but through high self-discipline he had converted the fire\r\ninto a central glow and motive power of life, instead of permitting it\r\nto waste itself in useless passion. 'He that is slow to anger,' saith\r\nthe sage, 'is greater than the mighty, and he that ruleth his own spirit\r\nthan he that taketh a city.' Faraday was not slow to anger, but he\r\ncompletely ruled his own spirit, and thus, though he took no cities, he\r\ncaptivated all hearts.\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, Faraday had contributed many of his minor\r\npapers--including his first analysis of caustic lime--to the 'Quarterly\r\nJournal of Science.' In 1832, he collected those papers and others\r\ntogether in a small octavo volume, labelled them, and prefaced them\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n'PAPERS, NOTES, NOTICES, &c., &c.,published in octavo, up to 1832. M.\r\nFaraday.'\r\n\r\n'Papers of mine, published in octavo, in the \"Quarterly Journal of\r\nScience,\" and elsewhere, since the time that Sir H. Davy encouraged me\r\nto write the analysis of caustic lime.\r\n\r\n'Some, I think (at this date), are good; others moderate; and some bad.\r\nBut I have put all into the volume, because of the utility they have\r\nbeen of to me--and none more than the bad--in pointing out to me in\r\nfuture, or rather, after times, the faults it became me to watch and to\r\navoid.\r\n\r\n'As I never looked over one of my papers a year after it was written\r\nwithout believing both in philosophy and manner it could have been much\r\nbetter done, I still hope the collection may be of great use to me.\r\n\r\n'M. Faraday.\r\n\r\n'Aug. 18, 1832.'\r\n\r\n'None more than the bad!' This is a bit of Faraday's innermost nature;\r\nand as I read these words I am almost constrained to retract what I have\r\nsaid regarding the fire and excitability of his character. But is he not\r\nall the more admirable, through his ability to tone down and subdue that\r\nfire and that excitability, so as to render himself able to write thus\r\nas a little child? I once took the liberty of censuring the conclusion\r\nof a letter of his to the Dean of St. Paul's. He subscribed himself\r\n'humbly yours,' and I objected to the adverb. 'Well, but, Tyndall,' he\r\nsaid, 'I am humble; and still it would be a great mistake to think that\r\nI am not also proud.' This duality ran through his character. A democrat\r\nin his defiance of all authority which unfairly limited his freedom of\r\nthought, and still ready to stoop in reverence to all that was really\r\nworthy of reverence, in the customs of the world or the characters of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAnd here, as well as elsewhere, may be introduced a letter which bears\r\nupon this question of self-control, written long years subsequent to the\r\nperiod at which we have now arrived. I had been at Glasgow in 1855, at\r\na meeting of the British Association. On a certain day, I communicated a\r\npaper to the physical section, which was followed by a brisk discussion.\r\nMen of great distinction took part in it, the late Dr. Whewell among the\r\nnumber, and it waxed warm on both sides. I was by no means content\r\nwith this discussion; and least of all, with my own part in it. This\r\ndiscontent affected me for some days, during which I wrote to\r\nFaraday, giving him no details, but expressing, in a general way, my\r\ndissatisfaction. I give the following extract from his reply:--\r\n\r\n'Sydenham, Oct. 6, 1855.\r\n\r\n'My Dear Tyndall,--These great meetings, of which I think very well\r\naltogether, advance science chiefly by bringing scientific men together\r\nand making them to know and be friends with each other; and I am sorry\r\nwhen that is not the effect in every part of their course. I know\r\nnothing except from what you tell me, for I have not yet looked at the\r\nreports of the proceedings; but let me, as an old man, who ought by this\r\ntime to have profited by experience, say that when I was younger I found\r\nI often misinterpreted the intentions of people, and found they did not\r\nmean what at the time I supposed they meant; and, further, that as a\r\ngeneral rule, it was better to be a little dull of apprehension where\r\nphrases seemed to imply pique, and quick in perception when, on the\r\ncontrary, they seemed to imply kindly feeling. The real truth never\r\nfails ultimately to appear; and opposing parties, if wrong, are sooner\r\nconvinced when replied to forbearingly, than when overwhelmed. All\r\nI mean to say is, that it is better to be blind to the results of\r\npartisanship, and quick to see good will. One has more happiness in\r\noneself in endeavouring to follow the things that make for peace. You\r\ncan hardly imagine how often I have been heated in private when opposed,\r\nas I have thought, unjustly and superciliously, and yet I have striven,\r\nand succeeded, I hope, in keeping down replies of the like kind. And I\r\nknow I have never lost by it. I would not say all this to you did I not\r\nesteem you as a true philosopher and friend.[1]\r\n\r\n'Yours, very truly,\r\n\r\n'M. Faraday.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote to Chapter 4\r\n\r\n     [1] Faraday would have been rejoiced to learn that, during\r\n     its last meeting at Dundee, the British Association\r\n     illustrated in a striking manner the function which he here\r\n     describes as its principal one. In my own case, a brotherly\r\n     welcome was everywhere manifested. In fact, the differences\r\n     of really honourable and sane men are never beyond healing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5.\r\n\r\n     Identity of electricities; first researches on\r\n     electro-chemistry.\r\n\r\nI have already once used the word 'discomfort' in reference to the\r\noccasional state of Faraday's mind when experimenting. It was to him a\r\ndiscomfort to reason upon data which admitted of doubt. He hated what he\r\ncalled 'doubtful knowledge,' and ever tended either to transfer it\r\ninto the region of undoubtful knowledge, or of certain and definite\r\nignorance. Pretence of all kinds, whether in life or in philosophy, was\r\nhateful to him. He wished to know the reality of our nescience as well\r\nas of our science. 'Be one thing or the other,' he seemed to say to\r\nan unproved hypothesis; 'come out as a solid truth, or disappear as a\r\nconvicted lie.' After making the great discovery which I have attempted\r\nto describe, a doubt seemed to beset him as regards the identity of\r\nelectricities. 'Is it right,' he seemed to ask, 'to call this agency\r\nwhich I have discovered electricity at all? Are there perfectly\r\nconclusive grounds for believing that the electricity of the\r\nmachine, the pile, the gymnotus and torpedo, magneto-electricity and\r\nthermo-electricity, are merely different manifestations of one and the\r\nsame agent?' To answer this question to his own satisfaction he formally\r\nreviewed the knowledge of that day. He added to it new experiments\r\nof his own, and finally decided in favour of the 'Identity of\r\nElectricities.' His paper upon this subject was read before the Royal\r\nSociety on January 10 and 17, 1833.\r\n\r\nAfter he had proved to his own satisfaction the identity of\r\nelectricities, he tried to compare them quantitatively together. The\r\nterms quantity and intensity, which Faraday constantly used, need a word\r\nof explanation here. He might charge a single Leyden jar by twenty turns\r\nof his machine, or he might charge a battery of ten jars by the same\r\nnumber of turns. The quantity in both cases would be sensibly the same,\r\nbut the intensity of the single jar would be the greatest, for here the\r\nelectricity would be less diffused. Faraday first satisfied himself that\r\nthe needle of his galvanometer was caused to swing through the same arc\r\nby the same quantity of machine electricity, whether it was condensed\r\nin a small battery or diffused over a large one. Thus the electricity\r\ndeveloped by thirty turns of his machine produced, under very variable\r\nconditions of battery surface, the same deflection. Hence he inferred\r\nthe possibility of comparing, as regards quantity, electricities which\r\ndiffer greatly from each other in intensity. His object now is to\r\ncompare frictional with voltaic electricity. Moistening bibulous paper\r\nwith the iodide of potassium--a favourite test of his--and subjecting\r\nit to the action of machine electricity, he decomposed the iodide, and\r\nformed a brown spot where the iodine was liberated. Then he immersed\r\ntwo wires, one of zinc, the other of platinum, each 1/13th of an inch\r\nin diameter, to a depth of 5/8ths of an inch in acidulated water during\r\neight beats of his watch, or 3/20ths of a second; and found that the\r\nneedle of his galvanometer swung through the same arc, and coloured\r\nhis moistened paper to the same extent, as thirty turns of his large\r\nelectrical machine. Twenty-eight turns of the machine produced an effect\r\ndistinctly less than that produced by his two wires. Now, the quantity\r\nof water decomposed by the wires in this experiment totally eluded\r\nobservation; it was immeasurably small; and still that amount of\r\ndecomposition involved the development of a quantity of electric force\r\nwhich, if applied in a proper form, would kill a rat, and no man would\r\nlike to bear it.\r\n\r\nIn his subsequent researches 'On the absolute Quantity of Electricity\r\nassociated with the Particles or Atoms of matter,' he endeavours to give\r\nan idea of the amount of electrical force involved in the decomposition\r\nof a single grain of water. He is almost afraid to mention it, for he\r\nestimates it at 800,000 discharges of his large Leyden battery. This, if\r\nconcentrated in a single discharge, would be equal to a very great flash\r\nof lightning; while the chemical action of a single grain of water\r\non four grains of zinc would yield electricity equal in quantity to a\r\npowerful thunderstorm. Thus his mind rises from the minute to the\r\nvast, expanding involuntarily from the smallest laboratory fact till it\r\nembraces the largest and grandest natural phenomena.[1]\r\n\r\nIn reality, however, he is at this time only clearing his way, and\r\nhe continues laboriously to clear it for some time afterwards. He is\r\ndigging the shaft, guided by that instinct towards the mineral lode\r\nwhich was to him a rod of divination. 'Er riecht die Wahrheit,' said the\r\nlamented Kohlrausch, an eminent German, once in my hearing:--'He smells\r\nthe truth.' His eyes are now steadily fixed on this wonderful voltaic\r\ncurrent, and he must learn more of its mode of transmission.\r\n\r\nOn May 23, 1833, he read a paper before the Royal Society 'On a new\r\nLaw of Electric Conduction.' He found that, though the current passed\r\nthrough water, it did not pass through ice:--why not, since they are\r\none and the same substance? Some years subsequently he answered this\r\nquestion by saying that the liquid condition enables the molecule\r\nof water to turn round so as to place itself in the proper line of\r\npolarization, while the rigidity of the solid condition prevents this\r\narrangement. This polar arrangement must precede decomposition, and\r\ndecomposition is an accompaniment of conduction. He then passed on to\r\nother substances; to oxides and chlorides, and iodides, and salts, and\r\nsulphurets, and found them all insulators when solid, and conductors\r\nwhen fused. In all cases, moreover, except one--and this exception he\r\nthought might be apparent only--he found the passage of the current\r\nacross the fused compound to be accompanied by its decomposition. Is\r\nthen the act of decomposition essential to the act of conduction in\r\nthese bodies? Even recently this question was warmly contested. Faraday\r\nwas very cautious latterly in expressing himself upon this subject;\r\nbut as a matter of fact he held that an infinitesimal quantity of\r\nelectricity might pass through a compound liquid without producing its\r\ndecomposition. De la Rive, who has been a great worker on the chemical\r\nphenomena of the pile, is very emphatic on the other side. Experiment,\r\naccording to him and others, establishes in the most conclusive manner\r\nthat no trace of electricity can pass through a liquid compound without\r\nproducing its equivalent decomposition.[2]\r\n\r\nFaraday has now got fairly entangled amid the chemical phenomena of the\r\npile, and here his previous training under Davy must have been of the\r\nmost important service to him. Why, he asks, should decomposition thus\r\ntake place?--what force is it that wrenches the locked constituents\r\nof these compounds asunder? On the 20th of June, 1833, he read a paper\r\nbefore the Royal Society 'On Electro-chemical Decomposition,' in which\r\nhe seeks to answer these questions. The notion had been entertained\r\nthat the poles, as they are called, of the decomposing cell, or in other\r\nwords the surfaces by which the current enters and quits the liquid,\r\nexercised electric attractions upon the constituents of the liquid and\r\ntore them asunder. Faraday combats this notion with extreme vigour.\r\nLitmus reveals, as you know, the action of an acid by turning red,\r\nturmeric reveals the action of an alkali by turning brown. Sulphate of\r\nsoda, you know, is a salt compounded of the alkali soda and sulphuric\r\nacid. The voltaic current passing through a solution of this salt\r\nso decomposes it, that sulphuric acid appears at one pole of the\r\ndecomposing cell and alkali at the other. Faraday steeped a piece of\r\nlitmus paper and a piece of turmeric paper in a solution of sulphate of\r\nsoda: placing each of them upon a separate plate of glass, he connected\r\nthem together by means of a string moistened with the same solution.\r\nHe then attached one of them to the positive conductor of an electric\r\nmachine, and the other to the gas-pipes of this building. These he\r\ncalled his 'discharging train.' On turning the machine the electricity\r\npassed from paper to paper through the string, which might be varied in\r\nlength from a few inches to seventy feet without changing the result.\r\nThe first paper was reddened, declaring the presence of sulphuric acid;\r\nthe second was browned, declaring the presence of the alkali soda. The\r\ndissolved salt, therefore, arranged in this fashion, was decomposed by\r\nthe machine, exactly as it would have been by the voltaic current.\r\nWhen instead of using the positive conductor he used the negative,\r\nthe positions of the acid and alkali were reversed. Thus he satisfied\r\nhimself that chemical decomposition by the machine is obedient to the\r\nlaws which rule decomposition by the pile.\r\n\r\nAnd now he gradually abolishes those so-called poles, to the attraction\r\nof which electric decomposition had been ascribed. He connected a piece\r\nof turmeric paper moistened with the sulphate of soda with the positive\r\nconductor of his machine; then he placed a metallic point in connection\r\nwith his discharging train opposite the moist paper, so that the\r\nelectricity should discharge through the air towards the point. The\r\nturning of the machine caused the corners of the piece of turmeric paper\r\nopposite to the point to turn brown, thus declaring the presence of\r\nalkali. He changed the turmeric for litmus paper, and placed it, not\r\nin connection with his conductor, but with his discharging train, a\r\nmetallic point connected with the conductor being fixed at a couple of\r\ninches from the paper; on turning the machine, acid was liberated at\r\nthe edges and corners of the litmus. He then placed a series of pointed\r\npieces of paper, each separate piece being composed of two halves,\r\none of litmus and the other of turmeric paper, and all moistened with\r\nsulphate of soda, in the line of the current from the machine. The\r\npieces of paper were separated from each other by spaces of air. The\r\nmachine was turned; and it was always found that at the point where the\r\nelectricity entered the paper, litmus was reddened, and at the point\r\nwhere it quitted the paper, turmeric was browned. 'Here,' he urges,\r\n'the poles are entirely abandoned, but we have still electrochemical\r\ndecomposition.' It is evident to him that instead of being attracted by\r\nthe poles, the bodies separated are ejected by the current. The effects\r\nthus obtained with poles of air he also succeeded in obtaining with\r\npoles of water. The advance in Faraday's own ideas made at this time is\r\nindicated by the word 'ejected.' He afterwards reiterates this view:\r\nthe evolved substances are expelled from the decomposing body, and 'not\r\ndrawn out by an attraction.\r\n\r\nHaving abolished this idea of polar attraction, he proceeds to enunciate\r\nand develop a theory of his own. He refers to Davy's celebrated Bakerian\r\nLecture, given in 1806, which he says 'is almost entirely occupied in\r\nthe consideration of electrochemical decompositions.' The facts recorded\r\nin that lecture Faraday regards as of the utmost value. But 'the mode\r\nof action by which the effects take place is stated very generally;\r\nso generally, indeed, that probably a dozen precise schemes of\r\nelectrochemical action might be drawn up, differing essentially from\r\neach other, yet all agreeing with the statement there given.'\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that these words might with justice be applied to\r\nFaraday's own researches at this time. They furnish us with results of\r\npermanent value; but little help can be found in the theory advanced\r\nto account for them. It would, perhaps, be more correct to say that\r\nthe theory itself is hardly presentable in any tangible form to the\r\nintellect. Faraday looks, and rightly looks, into the heart of the\r\ndecomposing body itself; he sees, and rightly sees, active within it\r\nthe forces which produce the decomposition, and he rejects, and rightly\r\nrejects, the notion of external attraction; but beyond the hypothesis of\r\ndecompositions and recompositions, enunciated and developed by Grothuss\r\nand Davy, he does not, I think, help us to any definite conception as\r\nto how the force reaches the decomposing mass and acts within it. Nor,\r\nindeed, can this be done, until we know the true physical process which\r\nunderlies what we call an electric current.\r\n\r\nFaraday conceives of that current as 'an axis of power having contrary\r\nforces exactly equal in amount in opposite directions'; but this\r\ndefinition, though much quoted and circulated, teaches us nothing\r\nregarding the current. An 'axis' here can only mean a direction; and\r\nwhat we want to be able to conceive of is, not the axis along which the\r\npower acts, but the nature and mode of action of the power itself. He\r\nobjects to the vagueness of De la Rive; but the fact is, that both\r\nhe and De la Rive labour under the same difficulty. Neither wishes\r\nto commit himself to the notion of a current compounded of two\r\nelectricities flowing in two opposite directions: but the time had\r\nnot come, nor is it yet come, for the displacement of this provisional\r\nfiction by the true mechanical conception. Still, however indistinct the\r\ntheoretic notions of Faraday at this time may be, the facts which are\r\nrising before him and around him are leading him gradually, but surely,\r\nto results of incalculable importance in relation to the philosophy of\r\nthe voltaic pile.\r\n\r\nHe had always some great object of research in view, but in the pursuit\r\nof it he frequently alighted on facts of collateral interest, to examine\r\nwhich he sometimes turned aside from his direct course. Thus we find the\r\nseries of his researches on electrochemical decomposition interrupted\r\nby an inquiry into 'the power of metals and other solids, to induce the\r\ncombination of gaseous bodies.' This inquiry, which was received by the\r\nRoyal Society on Nov. 30, 1833, though not so important as those\r\nwhich precede and follow it, illustrates throughout his strength as an\r\nexperimenter. The power of spongy platinum to cause the combination of\r\noxygen and hydrogen had been discovered by Dobereiner in 1823, and had\r\nbeen applied by him in the construction of his well-known philosophic\r\nlamp. It was shown subsequently by Dulong and Thenard that even a\r\nplatinum wire, when perfectly cleansed, may be raised to incandescence\r\nby its action on a jet of cold hydrogen.\r\n\r\nIn his experiments on the decomposition of water, Faraday found that\r\nthe positive platinum plate of the decomposing cell possessed in\r\nan extraordinary degree the power of causing oxygen and hydrogen to\r\ncombine. He traced the cause of this to the perfect cleanness of\r\nthe positive plate. Against it was liberated oxygen, which, with the\r\npowerful affinity of the 'nascent state,' swept away all impurity from\r\nthe surface against which it was liberated. The bubbles of gas liberated\r\non one of the platinum plates or wires of a decomposing cell are always\r\nmuch smaller, and they rise in much more rapid succession than those\r\nfrom the other. Knowing that oxygen is sixteen times heavier than\r\nhydrogen, I have more than once concluded, and, I fear, led others\r\ninto the error of concluding, that the smaller and more quickly rising\r\nbubbles must belong to the lighter gas. The thing appeared so obvious\r\nthat I did not give myself the trouble of looking at the battery, which\r\nwould at once have told me the nature of the gas. But Faraday would\r\nnever have been satisfied with a deduction if he could have reduced it\r\nto a fact. And he has taught me that the fact here is the direct reverse\r\nof what I supposed it to be. The small bubbles are oxygen, and their\r\nsmallness is due to the perfect cleanness of the surface on which they\r\nare liberated. The hydrogen adhering to the other electrode swells\r\ninto large bubbles, which rise in much slower succession; but when the\r\ncurrent is reversed, the hydrogen is liberated upon the cleansed wire,\r\nand then its bubbles also become small.\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 5\r\n\r\n     [1] Buff finds the quantity of electricity associated with\r\n     one milligramme of hydrogen in water to be equal to 45,480\r\n     charges of a Leyden jar, with a height of 480 millimetres,\r\n     and a diameter of 160 millimetres.  Weber and Kohlrausch\r\n     have calculated that, if the quantity of electricity\r\n     associated with one milligramme of hydrogen in water were\r\n     diffused over a cloud at a height of 1000 metres above the\r\n     earth, it would exert upon an equal quantity of the opposite\r\n     electricity at the earth's surface an attractive force of\r\n     2,268,000 kilogrammes.  (Electrolytische Maasbestimmungen,\r\n     1856, p. 262.)\r\n\r\n     [2] Faraday, sa Vie et ses Travaux, p. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6.\r\n\r\n     Laws of electro-chemical decomposition.\r\n\r\nIn our conceptions and reasonings regarding the forces of nature,\r\nwe perpetually make use of symbols which, when they possess a high\r\nrepresentative value, we dignify with the name of theories. Thus,\r\nprompted by certain analogies, we ascribe electrical phenomena to the\r\naction of a peculiar fluid, sometimes flowing, sometimes at rest. Such\r\nconceptions have their advantages and their disadvantages; they afford\r\npeaceful lodging to the intellect for a time, but they also circumscribe\r\nit, and by-and-by, when the mind has grown too large for its lodging, it\r\noften finds difficulty in breaking down the walls of what has become its\r\nprison instead of its home.[1]\r\n\r\nNo man ever felt this tyranny of symbols more deeply than Faraday, and\r\nno man was ever more assiduous than he to liberate himself from them,\r\nand the terms which suggested them. Calling Dr. Whewell to his aid\r\nin 1833, he endeavoured to displace by others all terms tainted by\r\na foregone conclusion. His paper on Electro-chemical Decomposition,\r\nreceived by the Royal Society on January 9, 1834, opens with the\r\nproposal of a new terminology. He would avoid the word 'current' if he\r\ncould.[2] He does abandon the word 'poles' as applied to the ends of\r\na decomposing cell, because it suggests the idea of attraction,\r\nsubstituting for it the perfectly natural term Electrodes. He applied\r\nthe term Electrolyte to every substance which can be decomposed by the\r\ncurrent, and the act of decomposition he called Electrolysis. All these\r\nterms have become current in science. He called the positive electrode\r\nthe Anode, and the negative one the Cathode, but these terms, though\r\nfrequently used, have not enjoyed the same currency as the others. The\r\nterms Anion and Cation, which he applied to the constituents of the\r\ndecomposed electrolyte, and the term Ion, which included both anions and\r\ncations, are still less frequently employed.\r\n\r\nFaraday now passes from terminology to research; he sees the necessity\r\nof quantitative determinations, and seeks to supply himself with a\r\nmeasure of voltaic electricity. This he finds in the quantity of water\r\ndecomposed by the current. He tests this measure in all possible ways,\r\nto assure himself that no error can arise from its employment. He\r\nplaces in the course of one and the same current a series of cells with\r\nelectrodes of different sizes, some of them plates of platinum, others\r\nmerely platinum wires, and collects the gas liberated on each distinct\r\npair of electrodes. He finds the quantity of gas to be the same for all.\r\nThus he concludes that when the same quantity of electricity is caused\r\nto pass through a series of cells containing acidulated water, the\r\nelectro-chemical action is independent of the size of the electrodes.[3]\r\nHe next proves that variations in intensity do not interfere with this\r\nequality of action. Whether his battery is charged with strong acid\r\nor with weak; whether it consists of five pairs or of fifty pairs; in\r\nshort, whatever be its source, when the same current is sent through his\r\nseries of cells the same amount of decomposition takes place in all. He\r\nnext assures himself that the strength or weakness of his dilute acid\r\ndoes not interfere with this law. Sending the same current through\r\na series of cells containing mixtures of sulphuric acid and water of\r\ndifferent strengths, he finds, however the proportion of acid to water\r\nmight vary, the same amount of gas to be collected in all the cells.\r\nA crowd of facts of this character forced upon Faraday's mind the\r\nconclusion that the amount of electro-chemical decomposition depends,\r\nnot upon the size of the electrodes, not upon the intensity of the\r\ncurrent, not upon the strength of the solution, but solely upon the\r\nquantity of electricity which passes through the cell. The quantity\r\nof electricity he concludes is proportional to the amount of chemical\r\naction. On this law Faraday based the construction of his celebrated\r\nVoltameter, or Measure of Voltaic electricity.\r\n\r\nBut before he can apply this measure he must clear his ground of\r\nnumerous possible sources of error. The decomposition of his acidulated\r\nwater is certainly a direct result of the current; but as the varied and\r\nimportant researches of MM. Becquerel, De la Rive, and others had shown,\r\nthere are also secondary actions which may materially interfere with and\r\ncomplicate the pure action of the current. These actions may occur in\r\ntwo ways: either the liberated ion may seize upon the electrode against\r\nwhich it is set free, forming a chemical compound with that electrode;\r\nor it may seize upon the substance of the electrolyte itself, and thus\r\nintroduce into the circuit chemical actions over and above those due to\r\nthe current. Faraday subjected these secondary actions to an exhaustive\r\nexamination. Instructed by his experiments, and rendered competent by\r\nthem to distinguish between primary and secondary results, he proceeds\r\nto establish the doctrine of 'Definite Electro-chemical Decomposition.'\r\n\r\nInto the same circuit he introduced his voltameter, which consisted of\r\na graduated tube filled with acidulated water and provided with platinum\r\nplates for the decomposition of the water, and also a cell containing\r\nchloride of tin. Experiments already referred to had taught him that\r\nthis substance, though an insulator when solid, is a conductor when\r\nfused, the passage of the current being always accompanied by the\r\ndecomposition of the chloride. He wished to ascertain what relation this\r\ndecomposition bore to that of the water in his voltameter.\r\n\r\nCompleting his circuit, he permitted the current to continue until 'a\r\nreasonable quantity of gas' was collected in the voltameter. The circuit\r\nwas then broken, and the quantity of tin liberated compared with the\r\nquantity of gas. The weight of the former was 3.2 grains, that of the\r\nlatter 0.49742 of a grain. Oxygen, as you know, unites with hydrogen in\r\nthe proportion of 8 to 1, to form water. Calling the equivalent, or as\r\nit is sometimes called, the atomic weight of hydrogen 1, that of oxygen\r\nis 8; that of water is consequently 8 + 1 or 9. Now if the quantity of\r\nwater decomposed in Faraday's experiment be represented by the number 9,\r\nor in other words by the equivalent of water, then the quantity of tin\r\nliberated from the fused chloride is found by an easy calculation to be\r\n57.9, which is almost exactly the chemical equivalent of tin. Thus both\r\nthe water and the chloride were broken up in proportions expressed\r\nby their respective equivalents. The amount of electric force which\r\nwrenched asunder the constituents of the molecule of water was\r\ncompetent, and neither more nor less than competent, to wrench asunder\r\nthe constituents of the molecules of the chloride of tin. The fact\r\nis typical. With the indications of his voltameter he compared the\r\ndecompositions of other substances, both singly and in series. He\r\nsubmitted his conclusions to numberless tests. He purposely introduced\r\nsecondary actions. He endeavoured to hamper the fulfilment of those laws\r\nwhich it was the intense desire of his mind to see established. But\r\nfrom all these difficulties emerged the golden truth, that under every\r\nvariety of circumstances the decompositions of the voltaic current are\r\nas definite in their character as those chemical combinations which gave\r\nbirth to the atomic theory. This law of Electro-chemical Decomposition\r\nranks, in point of importance, with that of Definite Combining\r\nProportions in chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 6\r\n\r\n     [1] I copy these words from the printed abstract of a Friday\r\n     evening lecture, given by myself, because they remind me of\r\n     Faraday's voice, responding to the utterance by an emphatic\r\n     'hear! hear!'--Proceedings of the Royal Institution, vol.\r\n     ii. p. 132.\r\n\r\n     [2] In 1838 he expresses himself thus:--'The word current is\r\n     so expressive in common language that when applied in the\r\n     consideration of electrical phenomena, we can hardly divest\r\n     it sufficiently of its meaning, or prevent our minds from\r\n     being prejudiced by it.'--Exp. Resear., vol. i. p. 515. ($\r\n     1617.)\r\n\r\n     [3] This conclusion needs qualification.  Faraday overlooked\r\n     the part played by ozone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7.\r\n\r\n     Origin of power in the voltaic pile.\r\n\r\nIn one of the public areas of the town of Como stands a statue with no\r\ninscription on its pedestal, save that of a single name, 'Volta.' The\r\nbearer of that name occupies a place for ever memorable in the history\r\nof science. To him we owe the discovery of the voltaic pile, to which\r\nfor a brief interval we must now turn our attention.\r\n\r\nThe objects of scientific thought being the passionless laws and\r\nphenomena of external nature, one might suppose that their investigation\r\nand discussion would be completely withdrawn from the region of the\r\nfeelings, and pursued by the cold dry light of the intellect alone.\r\nThis, however, is not always the case. Man carries his heart with him\r\ninto all his works. You cannot separate the moral and emotional from the\r\nintellectual; and thus it is that the discussion of a point of science\r\nmay rise to the heat of a battle-field. The fight between the rival\r\noptical theories of Emission and Undulation was of this fierce\r\ncharacter; and scarcely less fierce for many years was the contest as\r\nto the origin and maintenance of the power of the voltaic pile. Volta\r\nhimself supposed it to reside in the Contact of different metals.\r\nHere was exerted his 'Electro-motive force,' which tore the combined\r\nelectricities asunder and drove them as currents in opposite directions.\r\nTo render the circulation of the current possible, it was necessary to\r\nconnect the metals by a moist conductor; for when any two metals were\r\nconnected by a third, their relation to each other was such that a\r\ncomplete neutralisation of the electric motion was the result. Volta's\r\ntheory of metallic contact was so clear, so beautiful, and apparently\r\nso complete, that the best intellects of Europe accepted it as the\r\nexpression of natural law.\r\n\r\nVolta himself knew nothing of the chemical phenomena of the pile; but\r\nas soon as these became known, suggestions and intimations appeared that\r\nchemical action, and not metallic contact, might be the real source of\r\nvoltaic electricity. This idea was expressed by Fabroni in Italy, and\r\nby Wollaston in England. It was developed and maintained by those\r\n'admirable electricians,' Becquerel, of Paris, and De la Rive, of\r\nGeneva. The Contact Theory, on the other hand, received its chief\r\ndevelopment and illustration in Germany. It was long the scientific\r\ncreed of the great chemists and natural philosophers of that country,\r\nand to the present hour there may be some of them unable to liberate\r\nthemselves from the fascination of their first-love.\r\n\r\nAfter the researches which I have endeavoured to place before you, it\r\nwas impossible for Faraday to avoid taking a side in this controversy.\r\nHe did so in a paper 'On the Electricity of the Voltaic Pile,' received\r\nby the Royal Society on the 7th of April, 1834. His position in the\r\ncontroversy might have been predicted. He saw chemical effects going\r\nhand in hand with electrical effects, the one being proportional to the\r\nother; and, in the paper now before us, he proved that when the former\r\nwas excluded, the latter were sought for in vain. He produced a current\r\nwithout metallic contact; he discovered liquids which, though competent\r\nto transmit the feeblest currents--competent therefore to allow the\r\nelectricity of contact to flow through them if it were able to form a\r\ncurrent--were absolutely powerless when chemically inactive.\r\n\r\nOne of the very few experimental mistakes of Faraday occurred in\r\nthis investigation. He thought that with a single voltaic cell he\r\nhad obtained the spark before the metals touched, but he subsequently\r\ndiscovered his error. To enable the voltaic spark to pass through air\r\nbefore the terminals of the battery were united, it was necessary\r\nto exalt the electro-motive force of the battery by multiplying its\r\nelements; but all the elements Faraday possessed were unequal to the\r\ntask of urging the spark across the shortest measurable space of air.\r\nNor, indeed, could the action of the battery, the different metals of\r\nwhich were in contact with each other, decide the point in question.\r\nStill, as regards the identity of electricities from various sources,\r\nit was at that day of great importance to determine whether or not\r\nthe voltaic current could jump, as a spark, across an interval before\r\ncontact. Faraday's friend, Mr. Gassiot, solved this problem. He erected\r\na battery of 4000 cells, and with it urged a stream of sparks from\r\nterminal to terminal, when separated from each other by a measurable\r\nspace of air.\r\n\r\nThe memoir on the 'Electricity of the Voltaic Pile,' published in 1834,\r\nappears to have produced but little impression upon the supporters of\r\nthe contact theory. These indeed were men of too great intellectual\r\nweight and insight lightly to take up, or lightly to abandon a theory.\r\nFaraday therefore resumed the attack in a paper, communicated to the\r\nRoyal Society on the 6th of February, 1840. In this paper he hampered\r\nhis antagonists by a crowd of adverse experiments. He hung difficulty\r\nafter difficulty about the neck of the contact theory, until in its\r\nefforts to escape from his assaults it so changed its character as to\r\nbecome a thing totally different from the theory proposed by Volta. The\r\nmore persistently it was defended, however, the more clearly did it\r\nshow itself to be a congeries of devices, bearing the stamp of dialectic\r\nskill rather than of natural truth.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Faraday brought to bear upon it an argument which, had\r\nits full weight and purport been understood at the time, would have\r\ninstantly decided the controversy. 'The contact theory,' he urged,\r\n'assumed that a force which is able to overcome powerful resistance,\r\nas for instance that of the conductors, good or bad, through which the\r\ncurrent passes, and that again of the electrolytic action where bodies\r\nare decomposed by it, can arise out of nothing; that, without any change\r\nin the acting matter, or the consumption of any generating force, a\r\ncurrent shall be produced which shall go on for ever against a constant\r\nresistance, or only be stopped, as in the voltaic trough, by the ruins\r\nwhich its exertion has heaped up in its own course. This would indeed be\r\na creation of power, and is like no other force in nature. We have many\r\nprocesses by which the form of the power may be so changed, that an\r\napparent conversion of one into the other takes place. So we can change\r\nchemical force into the electric current, or the current into chemical\r\nforce. The beautiful experiments of Seebeck and Peltier show the\r\nconvertibility of heat and electricity; and others by Oersted and myself\r\nshow the convertibility of electricity and magnetism. But in no case,\r\nnot even in those of the Gymnotus and Torpedo, is there a pure creation\r\nor a production of power without a corresponding exhaustion of something\r\nto supply it.'\r\n\r\nThese words were published more than two years before either Mayer\r\nprinted his brief but celebrated essay on the Forces of Inorganic\r\nNature, or Mr. Joule published his first famous experiments on the\r\nMechanical Value of Heat. They illustrate the fact that before any great\r\nscientific principle receives distinct enunciation by individuals,\r\nit dwells more or less clearly in the general scientific mind. The\r\nintellectual plateau is already high, and our discoverers are those who,\r\nlike peaks above the plateau, rise a little above the general level of\r\nthought at the time.\r\n\r\nBut many years prior even to the foregoing utterance of Faraday, a\r\nsimilar argument had been employed. I quote here with equal pleasure\r\nand admiration the following passage written by Dr. Roget so far back as\r\n1829. Speaking of the contact theory, he says:--'If there could exist a\r\npower having the property ascribed to it by the hypothesis, namely,\r\nthat of giving continual impulse to a fluid in one constant direction,\r\nwithout being exhausted by its own action, it would differ essentially\r\nfrom all the known powers in nature. All the powers and sources of\r\nmotion with the operation of which we are acquainted, when producing\r\nthese peculiar effects, are expended in the same proportion as those\r\neffects are produced; and hence arises the impossibility of obtaining by\r\ntheir agency a perpetual effect; or in other words a perpetual motion.\r\nBut the electro-motive force, ascribed by Volta to the metals, when in\r\ncontact, is a force which, as long as a free course is allowed to the\r\nelectricity it sets in motion, is never expended, and continues to be\r\nexcited with undiminished power in the production of a never-ceasing\r\neffect. Against the truth of such a supposition the probabilities are\r\nall but infinite.' When this argument, which he employed independently,\r\nhad clearly fixed itself in his mind, Faraday never cared to experiment\r\nfurther on the source of electricity in the voltaic pile. The argument\r\nappeared to him 'to remove the foundation itself of the contact theory,'\r\nand he afterwards let it crumble down in peace.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote to Chapter 7\r\n\r\n     [1] To account for the electric current, which was really\r\n     the core of the whole discussion, Faraday demonstrated the\r\n     impotence of the Contact Theory as then enunciated and\r\n     defended.  Still, it is certain that two different metals,\r\n     when brought into contact, charge themselves, the one with\r\n     positive and the other with negative electricity.  I had the\r\n     pleasure of going over this ground with Kohlrausch in 1849,\r\n     and his experiments left no doubt upon my mind that the\r\n     contact electricity of Volta was a reality, though it could\r\n     produce no current.  With one of the beautiful instruments\r\n     devised by himself, Sir William Thomson has rendered this\r\n     point capable of sure and easy demonstration; and he and\r\n     others now hold what may be called a contact theory, which,\r\n     while it takes into account the action of the metals, also\r\n     embraces the chemical phenomena of the circuit.  Helmholtz,\r\n     I believe, was the first to give the contact theory this new\r\n     form, in his celebrated essay, Ueber die Erhaltung der\r\n     Kraft, p. 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8.\r\n\r\n     Researches on frictional electricity: induction: conduction:\r\n     specific inductive capacity: theory of contiguous particles.\r\n\r\nThe burst of power which had filled the four preceding years with an\r\namount of experimental work unparalleled in the history of science\r\npartially subsided in 1835, and the only scientific paper contributed\r\nby Faraday in that year was a comparatively unimportant one, 'On an\r\nimproved Form of the Voltaic Battery.' He brooded for a time: his\r\nexperiments on electrolysis had long filled his mind; he looked, as\r\nalready stated, into the very heart of the electrolyte, endeavouring to\r\nrender the play of its atoms visible to his mental eye. He had no doubt\r\nthat in this case what is called 'the electric current' was propagated\r\nfrom particle to particle of the electrolyte; he accepted the doctrine\r\nof decomposition and recomposition which, according to Grothuss and\r\nDavy, ran from electrode to electrode. And the thought impressed him\r\nmore and more that ordinary electric induction was also transmitted and\r\nsustained by the action of 'contiguous particles.'\r\n\r\nHis first great paper on frictional electricity was sent to the Royal\r\nSociety on November 30, 1837. We here find him face to face with an idea\r\nwhich beset his mind throughout his whole subsequent life,--the idea of\r\naction at a distance. It perplexed and bewildered him. In his attempts\r\nto get rid of this perplexity, he was often unconsciously rebelling\r\nagainst the limitations of the intellect itself. He loved to quote\r\nNewton upon this point; over and over again he introduces his memorable\r\nwords, 'That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to\r\nmatter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a\r\nvacuum and without the mediation of anything else, by and through which\r\nthis action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me\r\nso great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical\r\nmatters a competent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it. Gravity\r\nmust be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws;\r\nbut whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the\r\nconsideration of my readers.'[1]\r\n\r\nFaraday does not see the same difficulty in his contiguous particles.\r\nAnd yet, by transferring the conception from masses to particles, we\r\nsimply lessen size and distance, but we do not alter the quality of the\r\nconception. Whatever difficulty the mind experiences in conceiving\r\nof action at sensible distances, besets it also when it attempts to\r\nconceive of action at insensible distances. Still the investigation of\r\nthe point whether electric and magnetic effects were wrought out through\r\nthe intervention of contiguous particles or not, had a physical interest\r\naltogether apart from the metaphysical difficulty. Faraday grapples with\r\nthe subject experimentally. By simple intuition he sees that action at a\r\ndistance must be exerted in straight lines. Gravity, he knows, will not\r\nturn a corner, but exerts its pull along a right line; hence his aim and\r\neffort to ascertain whether electric action ever takes place in curved\r\nlines. This once proved, it would follow that the action is carried on\r\nby means of a medium surrounding the electrified bodies. His experiments\r\nin 1837 reduced, in his opinion, this point of demonstration. He then\r\nfound that he could electrify, by induction, an insulated sphere placed\r\ncompletely in the shadow of a body which screened it from direct action.\r\nHe pictured the lines of electric force bending round the edges of the\r\nscreen, and reuniting on the other side of it; and he proved that in\r\nmany cases the augmentation of the distance between his insulated sphere\r\nand the inducing body, instead of lessening, increased the charge of\r\nthe sphere. This he ascribed to the coalescence of the lines of electric\r\nforce at some distance behind the screen.\r\n\r\nFaraday's theoretic views on this subject have not received general\r\nacceptance, but they drove him to experiment, and experiment with him\r\nwas always prolific of results. By suitable arrangements he placed a\r\nmetallic sphere in the middle of a large hollow sphere, leaving a space\r\nof something more than half an inch between them. The interior\r\nsphere was insulated, the external one uninsulated. To the former he\r\ncommunicated a definite charge of electricity. It acted by induction\r\nupon the concave surface of the latter, and he examined how this act of\r\ninduction was effected by placing insulators of various kinds between\r\nthe two spheres. He tried gases, liquids, and solids, but the solids\r\nalone gave him positive results. He constructed two instruments of the\r\nforegoing description, equal in size and similar in form. The interior\r\nsphere of each communicated with the external air by a brass stem ending\r\nin a knob. The apparatus was virtually a Leyden jar, the two coatings of\r\nwhich were the two spheres, with a thick and variable insulator between\r\nthem. The amount of charge in each jar was determined by bringing\r\na proof-plane into contact with its knob and measuring by a torsion\r\nbalance the charge taken away. He first charged one of his instruments,\r\nand then dividing the charge with the other, found that when air\r\nintervened in both cases the charge was equally divided. But when\r\nshellac, sulphur, or spermaceti was interposed between the two spheres\r\nof one jar, while air occupied this interval in the other, then he found\r\nthat the instrument occupied by the 'solid dielectric' takes more than\r\nhalf the original charge. A portion of the charge was absorbed by\r\nthe dielectric itself. The electricity took time to penetrate the\r\ndielectric. Immediately after the discharge of the apparatus, no trace\r\nof electricity was found upon its knob. But after a time electricity was\r\nfound there, the charge having gradually returned from the dielectric\r\nin which it had been lodged. Different insulators possess this power\r\nof permitting the charge to enter them in different degrees. Faraday\r\nfigured their particles as polarized, and he concluded that the force of\r\ninduction is propagated from particle to particle of the dielectric from\r\nthe inner sphere to the outer one. This power of propagation possessed\r\nby insulators he called their 'Specific Inductive Capacity.'\r\n\r\nFaraday visualizes with the utmost clearness the state of his contiguous\r\nparticles; one after another they become charged, each succeeding\r\nparticle depending for its charge upon its predecessor. And now he seeks\r\nto break down the wall of partition between conductors and insulators.\r\n'Can we not,' he says, 'by a gradual chain of association carry up\r\ndischarge from its occurrence in air through spermaceti and water, to\r\nsolutions, and then on to chlorides, oxides, and metals, without any\r\nessential change in its character?' Even copper, he urges, offers\r\na resistance to the transmission of electricity. The action of its\r\nparticles differs from those of an insulator only in degree. They are\r\ncharged like the particles of the insulator, but they discharge with\r\ngreater ease and rapidity; and this rapidity of molecular discharge is\r\nwhat we call conduction. Conduction then is always preceded by atomic\r\ninduction; and when, through some quality of the body which Faraday\r\ndoes not define, the atomic discharge is rendered slow and difficult,\r\nconduction passes into insulation.\r\n\r\nThough they are often obscure, a fine vein of philosophic thought runs\r\nthrough those investigations. The mind of the philosopher dwells amid\r\nthose agencies which underlie the visible phenomena of Induction and\r\nConduction; and he tries by the strong light of his imagination to see\r\nthe very molecules of his dielectrics. It would, however, be easy to\r\ncriticise these researches, easy to show the looseness, and sometimes\r\nthe inaccuracy, of the phraseology employed; but this critical spirit\r\nwill get little good out of Faraday. Rather let those who ponder his\r\nworks seek to realise the object he set before him, not permitting\r\nhis occasional vagueness to interfere with their appreciation of his\r\nspeculations. We may see the ripples, and eddies, and vortices of a\r\nflowing stream, without being able to resolve all these motions into\r\ntheir constituent elements; and so it sometimes strikes me that Faraday\r\nclearly saw the play of fluids and ethers and atoms, though his\r\nprevious training did not enable him to resolve what he saw into its\r\nconstituents, or describe it in a manner satisfactory to a mind versed\r\nin mechanics. And then again occur, I confess, dark sayings, difficult\r\nto be understood, which disturb my confidence in this conclusion. It\r\nmust, however, always be remembered that he works at the very boundaries\r\nof our knowledge, and that his mind habitually dwells in the 'boundless\r\ncontiguity of shade' by which that knowledge is surrounded.\r\n\r\nIn the researches now under review the ratio of speculation and\r\nreasoning to experiment is far higher than in any of Faraday's previous\r\nworks. Amid much that is entangled and dark we have flashes of wondrous\r\ninsight and utterances which seem less the product of reasoning than of\r\nrevelation. I will confine myself here to one example of this divining\r\npower. By his most ingenious device of a rapidly rotating mirror,\r\nWheatstone had proved that electricity required time to pass through\r\na wire, the current reaching the middle of the wire later than its\r\ntwo ends. 'If,' says Faraday, 'the two ends of the wire in Professor\r\nWheatstone's experiments were immediately connected with two large\r\ninsulated metallic surfaces exposed to the air, so that the primary act\r\nof induction, after making the contact for discharge, might be in part\r\nremoved from the internal portion of the wire at the first instance,\r\nand disposed for the moment on its surface jointly with the air and\r\nsurrounding conductors, then I venture to anticipate that the middle\r\nspark would be more retarded than before. And if those two plates were\r\nthe inner and outer coatings of a large jar or Leyden battery, then\r\nthe retardation of the spark would be much greater.' This was only\r\na prediction, for the experiment was not made.[2] Sixteen years\r\nsubsequently, however, the proper conditions came into play, and Faraday\r\nwas able to show that the observations of Werner Siemens, and Latimer\r\nClark, on subterraneous and submarine wires were illustrations, on a\r\ngrand scale, of the principle which he had enunciated in 1838. The wires\r\nand the surrounding water act as a Leyden jar, and the retardation of\r\nthe current predicted by Faraday manifests itself in every message sent\r\nby such cables.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of Faraday in these memoirs on Induction and Conduction is,\r\nas I have said, by no means always clear; and the difficulty will\r\nbe most felt by those who are best trained in ordinary theoretic\r\nconceptions. He does not know the reader's needs, and he therefore\r\ndoes not meet them. For instance he speaks over and over again of\r\nthe impossibility of charging a body with one electricity, though the\r\nimpossibility is by no means evident. The key to the difficulty is this.\r\nHe looks upon every insulated conductor as the inner coating of a Leyden\r\njar. An insulated sphere in the middle of a room is to his mind such a\r\ncoating; the walls are the outer coating, while the air between both is\r\nthe insulator, across which the charge acts by induction. Without this\r\nreaction of the walls upon the sphere you could no more, according to\r\nFaraday, charge it with electricity than you could charge a Leyden jar,\r\nif its outer coating were removed. Distance with him is immaterial. His\r\nstrength as a generalizer enables him to dissolve the idea of magnitude;\r\nand if you abolish the walls of the room--even the earth itself--he\r\nwould make the sun and planets the outer coating of his jar. I dare not\r\ncontend that Faraday in these memoirs made all his theoretic positions\r\ngood. But a pure vein of philosophy runs through these writings; while\r\nhis experiments and reasonings on the forms and phenomena of electrical\r\ndischarge are of imperishable importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 8\r\n\r\n     [1] Newton's third letter to Bentley.\r\n\r\n     [2] Had Sir Charles Wheatstone been induced to resume his\r\n     measurements, varying the substances through which, and the\r\n     conditions under which, the current is propagated, he might\r\n     have rendered great service to science, both theoretic and\r\n     experimental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9.\r\n\r\n     Rest needed--visit to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe last of these memoirs was dated from the Royal Institution in June,\r\n1838. It concludes the first volume of his 'Experimental Researches on\r\nElectricity.' In 1840, as already stated, he made his final assault on\r\nthe Contact Theory, from which it never recovered.[1] He was now feeling\r\nthe effects of the mental strain to which he had been subjected for so\r\nmany years. During these years he repeatedly broke down. His wife alone\r\nwitnessed the extent of his prostration, and to her loving care we, and\r\nthe world, are indebted for the enjoyment of his presence here so long.\r\nHe found occasional relief in a theatre. He frequently quitted London\r\nand went to Brighton and elsewhere, always choosing a situation which\r\ncommanded a view of the sea, or of some other pleasant horizon, where he\r\ncould sit and gaze and feel the gradual revival of the faith that\r\n\r\n          'Nature never did betray\r\n           The heart that loved her.'\r\n\r\nBut very often for some days after his removal to the country, he would\r\nbe unable to do more than sit at a window and look out upon the sea and\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, his state became more serious than it had ever been before. A\r\npublished letter to Mr. Richard Taylor, dated March 11, 1843, contains\r\nan allusion to his previous condition. 'You are aware,' he says, 'that\r\nconsiderations regarding health have prevented me from working or\r\nreading on science for the last two years.' This, at one period\r\nor another of their lives, seems to be the fate of most great\r\ninvestigators. They do not know the limits of their constitutional\r\nstrength until they have transgressed them. It is, perhaps, right that\r\nthey should transgress them, in order to ascertain where they lie.\r\nFaraday, however, though he went far towards it, did not push his\r\ntransgression beyond his power of restitution. In 1841 Mrs. Faraday and\r\nhe went to Switzerland, under the affectionate charge of her brother,\r\nMr. George Barnard, the artist. This time of suffering throws fresh\r\nlight upon his character. I have said that sweetness and gentleness were\r\nnot its only constituents; that he was also fiery and strong. At the\r\ntime now referred to, his fire was low and his strength distilled away;\r\nbut the residue of his life was neither irritability nor discontent. He\r\nwas unfit to mingle in society, for conversation was a pain to him; but\r\nlet us observe the great Man-child when alone. He is at the village of\r\nInterlaken, enjoying Jungfrau sunsets, and at times watching the Swiss\r\nnailers making their nails. He keeps a little journal, in which he\r\ndescribes the process of nailmaking, and incidentally throws a luminous\r\nbeam upon himself.\r\n\r\n'August 2, 1841.--Clout nailmaking goes on here rather considerably, and\r\nis a very neat and pretty operation to observe. I love a smith's shop\r\nand anything relating to smithery. My father was a smith.'\r\n\r\nFrom Interlaken he went to the Falls of the Giessbach, on the pleasant\r\nlake of Brientz. And here we have him watching the shoot of the cataract\r\ndown its series of precipices. It is shattered into foam at the base of\r\neach, and tossed by its own recoil as water-dust through the air. The\r\nsun is at his back, shining on the drifting spray, and he thus describes\r\nand muses on what he sees:--\r\n\r\n'August 12, 1841.--To-day every fall was foaming from the abundance of\r\nwater, and the current of wind brought down by it was in some places too\r\nstrong to stand against. The sun shone brightly, and the rainbows seen\r\nfrom various points were very beautiful. One at the bottom of a fine but\r\nfurious fall was very pleasant,--there it remained motionless, whilst\r\nthe gusts and clouds of spray swept furiously across its place and were\r\ndashed against the rock. It looked like a spirit strong in faith and\r\nsteadfast in the midst of the storm of passions sweeping across it, and\r\nthough it might fade and revive, still it held on to the rock as in hope\r\nand giving hope. And the very drops, which in the whirlwind of their\r\nfury seemed as if they would carry all away, were made to revive it and\r\ngive it greater beauty.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote to Chapter 9\r\n\r\n     [1] See note, p. 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10.\r\n\r\n     Magnetization of light.\r\n\r\nBut we must quit the man and go on to the discoverer: we shall return\r\nfor a brief space to his company by-and-by. Carry your thoughts back to\r\nhis last experiments, and see him endeavouring to prove that induction\r\nis due to the action of contiguous particles. He knew that polarized\r\nlight was a most subtle and delicate investigator of molecular\r\ncondition. He used it in 1834 in exploring his electrolytes, and he\r\ntried it in 1838 upon his dielectrics. At that time he coated two\r\nopposite faces of a glass cube with tinfoil, connected one coating with\r\nhis powerful electric machine and the other with the earth, and examined\r\nby polarized light the condition of the glass when thus subjected to\r\nstrong electric influence. He failed to obtain any effect; still he was\r\npersuaded an action existed, and required only suitable means to call it\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from Switzerland he was beset by these thoughts; they\r\nwere more inspired than logical: but he resorted to magnets and proved\r\nhis inspiration true. His dislike of 'doubtful knowledge' and his\r\nefforts to liberate his mind from the thraldom of hypotheses have been\r\nalready referred to. Still this rebel against theory was incessantly\r\ntheorising himself. His principal researches are all connected by an\r\nundercurrent of speculation. Theoretic ideas were the very sap of his\r\nintellect--the source from which all his strength as an experimenter was\r\nderived. While once sauntering with him through the Crystal Palace, at\r\nSydenham, I asked him what directed his attention to the magnetization\r\nof light. It was his theoretic notions. He had certain views regarding\r\nthe unity and convertibility of natural forces; certain ideas regarding\r\nthe vibrations of light and their relations to the lines of magnetic\r\nforce; these views and ideas drove him to investigation. And so it must\r\nalways be: the great experimentalist must ever be the habitual theorist,\r\nwhether or not he gives to his theories formal enunciation.\r\n\r\nFaraday, you have been informed, endeavoured to improve the manufacture\r\nof glass for optical purposes. But though he produced a heavy glass of\r\ngreat refractive power, its value to optics did not repay him for\r\nthe pains and labour bestowed on it. Now, however, we reach a result\r\nestablished by means of this same heavy glass, which made ample amends\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1845, he announced his discovery of the 'Magnetization of\r\nLight and the Illumination of the Lines of Magnetic Force.' This title\r\nprovoked comment at the time, and caused misapprehension. He therefore\r\nadded an explanatory note; but the note left his meaning as entangled as\r\nbefore. In fact Faraday had notions regarding the magnetization of light\r\nwhich were peculiar to himself, and untranslatable into the scientific\r\nlanguage of the time. Probably no other philosopher of his day would\r\nhave employed the phrases just quoted as appropriate to the discovery\r\nannounced in 1845. But Faraday was more than a philosopher; he was\r\na prophet, and often wrought by an inspiration to be understood by\r\nsympathy alone. The prophetic element in his character occasionally\r\ncoloured, and even injured, the utterance of the man of science;\r\nbut subtracting that element, though you might have conferred on him\r\nintellectual symmetry, you would have destroyed his motive force.\r\n\r\nBut let us pass from the label of this casket to the jewel it\r\ncontains. 'I have long,' he says, 'held an opinion, almost amounting\r\nto conviction, in common, I believe, with many other lovers of natural\r\nknowledge, that the various forms under which the forces of matter are\r\nmade manifest have one common origin; in other words, are so directly\r\nrelated and mutually dependent, that they are convertible, as it were,\r\ninto one another, and possess equivalents of power in their action....\r\nThis strong persuasion,' he adds, 'extended to the powers of light.'\r\nAnd then he examines the action of magnets upon light. From conversation\r\nwith him and Anderson, I should infer that the labour preceding this\r\ndiscovery was very great. The world knows little of the toil of the\r\ndiscoverer. It sees the climber jubilant on the mountain top, but\r\ndoes not know the labour expended in reaching it. Probably hundreds of\r\nexperiments had been made on transparent crystals before he thought of\r\ntesting his heavy glass. Here is his own clear and simple description\r\nof the result of his first experiment with this substance:--'A piece of\r\nthis glass, about two inches square, and 0.5 of an inch thick, having\r\nflat and polished edges, was placed as a diamagnetic[1] between the\r\npoles (not as yet magnetized by the electric current), so that the\r\npolarized ray should pass through its length; the glass acted as air,\r\nwater, or any other transparent substance would do; and if the eye-piece\r\nwere previously turned into such a position that the polarized ray was\r\nextinguished, or rather the image produced by it rendered invisible,\r\nthen the introduction of the glass made no alteration in this respect.\r\nIn this state of circumstances, the force of the electro-magnet\r\nwas developed by sending an electric current through its coils, and\r\nimmediately the image of the lamp-flame became visible and continued so\r\nas long as the arrangement continued magnetic. On stopping the electric\r\ncurrent, and so causing the magnetic force to cease, the light instantly\r\ndisappeared. These phenomena could be renewed at pleasure, at any\r\ninstant of time, and upon any occasion, showing a perfect dependence of\r\ncause and effect.'\r\n\r\nIn a beam of ordinary light the particles of the luminiferous ether\r\nvibrate in all directions perpendicular to the line of progression; by\r\nthe act of polarization, performed here by Faraday, all oscillations\r\nbut those parallel to a certain plane are eliminated. When the plane\r\nof vibration of the polarizer coincides with that of the analyzer, a\r\nportion of the beam passes through both; but when these two planes\r\nare at right angles to each other, the beam is extinguished. If by any\r\nmeans, while the polarizer and analyzer remain thus crossed, the plane\r\nof vibration of the polarized beam between them could be changed,\r\nthen the light would be, in part at least, transmitted. In Faraday's\r\nexperiment this was accomplished. His magnet turned the plane of\r\npolarization of the beam through a certain angle, and thus enabled it\r\nto get through the analyzer; so that 'the magnetization of light and the\r\nillumination of the magnetic lines of force' becomes, when expressed\r\nin the language of modern theory, the rotation of the plane of\r\npolarization.\r\n\r\nTo him, as to all true philosophers, the main value of a fact was its\r\nposition and suggestiveness in the general sequence of scientific truth.\r\nHence, having established the existence of a phenomenon, his habit\r\nwas to look at it from all possible points of view, and to develop its\r\nrelationship to other phenomena. He proved that the direction of the\r\nrotation depends upon the polarity of his magnet; being reversed when\r\nthe magnetic poles are reversed. He showed that when a polarized ray\r\npassed through his heavy glass in a direction parallel to the magnetic\r\nlines of force, the rotation is a maximum, and that when the direction\r\nof the ray is at right angles to the lines of force, there is no\r\nrotation at all. He also proved that the amount of the rotation is\r\nproportional to the length of the diamagnetic through which the ray\r\npasses. He operated with liquids and solutions. Of aqueous solutions he\r\ntried 150 and more, and found the power in all of them. He then examined\r\ngases; but here all his efforts to produce any sensible action upon\r\nthe polarized beam were ineffectual. He then passed from magnets to\r\ncurrents, enclosing bars of heavy glass, and tubes containing liquids\r\nand aqueous solutions within an electro-magnetic helix. A current sent\r\nthrough the helix caused the plane of polarization to rotate, and always\r\nin the direction of the current. The rotation was reversed when the\r\ncurrent was reversed. In the case of magnets, he observed a gradual,\r\nthough quick, ascent of the transmitted beam from a state of darkness\r\nto its maximum brilliancy, when the magnet was excited. In the case of\r\ncurrents, the beam attained at once its maximum. This he showed to be\r\ndue to the time required by the iron of the electro-magnet to assume its\r\nfull magnetic power, which time vanishes when a current, without iron,\r\nis employed. 'In this experiment,' he says, 'we may, I think, justly\r\nsay that a ray of light is electrified, and the electric forces\r\nilluminated.' In the helix, as with the magnets, he submitted air to\r\nmagnetic influence 'carefully and anxiously,' but could not discover any\r\ntrace of action on the polarized ray.\r\n\r\nMany substances possess the power of turning the plane of polarization\r\nwithout the intervention of magnetism. Oil of turpentine and quartz\r\nare examples; but Faraday showed that, while in one direction, that is,\r\nacross the lines of magnetic force, his rotation is zero, augmenting\r\ngradually from this until it attains its maximum, when the direction of\r\nthe ray is parallel to the lines of force; in the oil of turpentine the\r\nrotation is independent of the direction of the ray. But he showed that\r\na still more profound distinction exists between the magnetic rotation\r\nand the natural one. I will try to explain how. Suppose a tube with\r\nglass ends containing oil of turpentine to be placed north and south.\r\nFixing the eye at the south end of the tube, let a polarized beam be\r\nsent through it from the north. To the observer in this position\r\nthe rotation of the plane of polarization, by the turpentine, is\r\nright-handed. Let the eye be placed at the north end of the tube, and\r\na beam be sent through it from the south; the rotation is still\r\nright-handed. Not so, however, when a bar of heavy glass is subjected\r\nto the action of an electric current. In this case if, in the first\r\nposition of the eye, the rotation be right-handed, in the second\r\nposition it is left-handed. These considerations make it manifest that\r\nif a polarized beam, after having passed through the oil of turpentine\r\nin its natural state, could by any means be reflected back through the\r\nliquid, the rotation impressed upon the direct beam would be exactly\r\nneutralized by that impressed upon the reflected one. Not so with the\r\ninduced magnetic effect. Here it is manifest that the rotation would\r\nbe doubled by the act of reflection. Hence Faraday concludes that the\r\nparticles of the oil of turpentine which rotate by virtue of their\r\nnatural force, and those which rotate in virtue of the induced force,\r\ncannot be in the same condition. The same remark applies to all bodies\r\nwhich possess a natural power of rotating the plane of polarization.\r\n\r\nAnd then he proceeded with exquisite skill and insight to take advantage\r\nof this conclusion. He silvered the ends of his piece of heavy glass,\r\nleaving, however, a narrow portion parallel to two edges diagonally\r\nopposed to each other unsilvered. He then sent his beam through this\r\nuncovered portion, and by suitably inclining his glass caused the beam\r\nwithin it to reach his eye first direct, and then after two, four, and\r\nsix reflections. These corresponded to the passage of the ray once,\r\nthree times, five times, and seven times through the glass. He thus\r\nestablished with numerical accuracy the exact proportionality of the\r\nrotation to the distance traversed by the polarized beam. Thus in one\r\nseries of experiments where the rotation required by the direct beam\r\nwas 12degrees, that acquired by three passages through the glass was\r\n36degrees, while that acquired by five passages was 60degrees. But even\r\nwhen this method of magnifying was applied, he failed with various\r\nsolid substances to obtain any effect; and in the case of air, though he\r\nemployed to the utmost the power which these repeated reflections placed\r\nin his hands, he failed to produce the slightest sensible rotation.\r\n\r\nThese failures of Faraday to obtain the effect with gases seem to\r\nindicate the true seat of the phenomenon. The luminiferous ether\r\nsurrounds and is influenced by the ultimate particles of matter. The\r\nsymmetry of the one involves that of the other. Thus, if the molecules\r\nof a crystal be perfectly symmetrical round any line through the\r\ncrystal, we may safely conclude that a ray will pass along this line\r\nas through ordinary glass. It will not be doubly refracted. From the\r\nsymmetry of the liquid figures, known to be produced in the planes of\r\nfreezing, when radiant heat is sent through ice, we may safely infer\r\nsymmetry of aggregation, and hence conclude that the line perpendicular\r\nto the planes of freezing is a line of no double refraction; that it is,\r\nin fact, the optic axis of the crystal. The same remark applies to the\r\nline joining the opposite blunt angles of a crystal of Iceland spar.\r\nThe arrangement of the molecules round this line being symmetrical,\r\nthe condition of the ether depending upon these molecules shares their\r\nsymmetry; and there is, therefore, no reason why the wavelength should\r\nalter with the alteration of the azimuth round this line. Annealed glass\r\nhas its molecules symmetrically arranged round every line that can\r\nbe drawn through it; hence it is not doubly refractive. But let the\r\nsubstance be either squeezed or strained in one direction, the molecular\r\nsymmetry, and with it the symmetry of the ether, is immediately\r\ndestroyed and the glass becomes doubly refractive. Unequal heating\r\nproduces the same effect. Thus mechanical strains reveal themselves by\r\noptical effects; and there is little doubt that in Faraday's experiment\r\nit is the magnetic strain that produces the rotation of the plane of\r\npolarization.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 10\r\n\r\n     [1] 'By a diamagnetic,' says Faraday, 'I mean a body through\r\n     which lines of magnetic force are passing,  and which does\r\n     not by their action assume the usual magnetic state of iron\r\n     or loadstone.' Faraday subsequently used this term in a\r\n     different sense from that here given, as will immediately\r\n     appear.\r\n\r\n     [2] The power of double refraction conferred on the centre\r\n     of a glass rod, when it is caused to sound the fundamental\r\n     note due to its longitudinal vibration, and the absence of\r\n     the same power in the case of vibrating air (enclosed in a\r\n     glass organ-pipe), seems to be analogous to the presence and\r\n     absence of Faraday's effect in the same two substances.\r\n     Faraday never, to my knowledge, attempted to give, even in\r\n     conversation, a picture of the molecular condition of his\r\n     heavy glass when subjected to magnetic influence.  In a\r\n     mathematical investigation of the subject, published in the\r\n     Proceedings of the Royal Society for 1856, Sir William\r\n     Thomson arrives at the conclusion that the 'diamagnetic' is\r\n     in a state of molecular rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11.\r\n\r\n     Discovery of diamagnetism--researches on magne-crystallic\r\n     action.\r\n\r\nFaraday's next great step in discovery was announced in a memoir on the\r\n'Magnetic Condition of all matter,' communicated to the Royal Society on\r\nDecember 18, 1845. One great source of his success was the employment\r\nof extraordinary power. As already stated, he never accepted a negative\r\nanswer to an experiment until he had brought to bear upon it all the\r\nforce at his command. He had over and over again tried steel magnets and\r\nordinary electro-magnets on various substances, but without detecting\r\nanything different from the ordinary attraction exhibited by a few of\r\nthem. Stronger coercion, however, developed a new action. Before the\r\npole of an electro-magnet, he suspended a fragment of his famous heavy\r\nglass; and observed that when the magnet was powerfully excited the\r\nglass fairly retreated from the pole. It was a clear case of magnetic\r\nrepulsion. He then suspended a bar of the glass between two poles;\r\nthe bar retreated when the poles were excited, and set its length\r\nequatorially or at right angles to the line joining them. When an\r\nordinary magnetic body was similarly suspended, it always set axially,\r\nthat is, from pole to pole.\r\n\r\nFaraday called those bodies which were repelled by the poles of a\r\nmagnet, diamagnetic bodies; using this term in a sense different from\r\nthat in which he employed it in his memoir on the magnetization of\r\nlight. The term magnetic he reserved for bodies which exhibited the\r\nordinary attraction. He afterwards employed the term magnetic to cover\r\nthe whole phenomena of attraction and repulsion, and used the word\r\nparamagnetic to designate such magnetic action as is exhibited by iron.\r\n\r\nIsolated observations by Brugmanns, Becquerel, Le Baillif, Saigy, and\r\nSeebeck had indicated the existence of a repulsive force exercised by\r\nthe magnet on two or three substances; but these observations, which\r\nwere unknown to Faraday, had been permitted to remain without extension\r\nor examination. Having laid hold of the fact of repulsion, Faraday\r\nimmediately expanded and multiplied it. He subjected bodies of the most\r\nvaried qualities to the action of his magnet:--mineral salts, acids,\r\nalkalis, ethers, alcohols, aqueous solutions, glass, phosphorus,\r\nresins, oils, essences, vegetable and animal tissues, and found them\r\nall amenable to magnetic influence. No known solid or liquid proved\r\ninsensible to the magnetic power when developed in sufficient strength.\r\nAll the tissues of the human body, the blood--though it contains\r\niron--included, were proved to be diamagnetic. So that if you could\r\nsuspend a man between the poles of a magnet, his extremities would\r\nretreat from the poles until his length became equatorial.\r\n\r\nSoon after he had commenced his researches on diamagnetism, Faraday\r\nnoticed a remarkable phenomenon which first crossed my own path in the\r\nfollowing way: In the year 1849, while working in the cabinet of my\r\nfriend, Professor Knoblauch, of Marburg, I suspended a small copper coin\r\nbetween the poles of an electro-magnet. On exciting the magnet, the coin\r\nmoved towards the poles and then suddenly stopped, as if it had struck\r\nagainst a cushion. On breaking the circuit, the coin was repelled, the\r\nrevulsion being so violent as to cause it to spin several times round\r\nits axis of suspension. A Silber-groschen similarly suspended exhibited\r\nthe same deportment. For a moment I thought this a new discovery; but on\r\nlooking over the literature of the subject, it appeared that Faraday\r\nhad observed, multiplied, and explained the same effect during his\r\nresearches on diamagnetism. His explanation was based upon his own great\r\ndiscovery of magneto-electric currents. The effect is a most singular\r\none. A weight of several pounds of copper may be set spinning between\r\nthe electro-magnetic poles; the excitement of the magnet instantly stops\r\nthe rotation. Though nothing is apparent to the eye, the copper, if\r\nmoved in the excited magnetic field, appears to move through a viscous\r\nfluid; while, when a flat piece of the metal is caused to pass to and\r\nfro like a saw between the poles, the sawing of the magnetic field\r\nresembles the cutting through of cheese or butter.[1] This virtual\r\nfriction of the magnetic field is so strong, that copper, by its rapid\r\nrotation between the poles, might probably be fused. We may easily\r\ndismiss this experiment by saying that the heat is due to the electric\r\ncurrents excited in the copper. But so long as we are unable to reply\r\nto the question, 'What is an electric current?' the explanation is only\r\nprovisional. For my own part, I look with profound interest and hope on\r\nthe strange action here referred to.\r\n\r\nFaraday's thoughts ran intuitively into experimental combinations,\r\nso that subjects whose capacity for experimental treatment would, to\r\nordinary minds, seem to be exhausted in a moment, were shown by him to\r\nbe all but inexhaustible. He has now an object in view, the first step\r\ntowards which is the proof that the principle of Archimedes is true of\r\nmagnetism. He forms magnetic solutions of various degrees of strength,\r\nplaces them between the poles of his magnet, and suspends in the\r\nsolutions various magnetic bodies. He proves that when the solution\r\nis stronger than the body plunged in it, the body, though magnetic,\r\nis repelled; and when an elongated piece of it is surrounded by the\r\nsolution, it sets, like a diamagnetic body, equatorially between the\r\nexcited poles. The same body when suspended in a solution of weaker\r\nmagnetic power than itself, is attracted as a whole, while an elongated\r\nportion of it sets axially.\r\n\r\nAnd now theoretic questions rush in upon him. Is this new force a true\r\nrepulsion, or is it merely a differential attraction? Might not the\r\napparent repulsion of diamagnetic bodies be really due to the greater\r\nattraction of the medium by which they are surrounded? He tries the\r\nrarefaction of air, but finds the effect insensible. He is averse to\r\nascribing a capacity of attraction to space, or to any hypothetical\r\nmedium supposed to fill space. He therefore inclines, but still with\r\ncaution, to the opinion that the action of a magnet upon bismuth is a\r\ntrue and absolute repulsion, and not merely the result of differential\r\nattraction. And then he clearly states a theoretic view sufficient to\r\naccount for the phenomena. 'Theoretically,' he says, 'an explanation of\r\nthe movements of the diamagnetic bodies, and all the dynamic phenomena\r\nconsequent upon the action of magnets upon them, might be offered in the\r\nsupposition that magnetic induction caused in them a contrary state to\r\nthat which it produced in ordinary matter.' That is to say, while in\r\nordinary magnetic influence the exciting pole excites adjacent to itself\r\nthe contrary magnetism, in diamagnetic bodies the adjacent magnetism is\r\nthe same as that of the exciting pole. This theory of reversed polarity,\r\nhowever, does not appear to have ever laid deep hold of Faraday's mind;\r\nand his own experiments failed to give any evidence of its truth. He\r\ntherefore subsequently abandoned it, and maintained the non-polarity of\r\nthe diamagnetic force.\r\n\r\nHe then entered a new, though related field of inquiry. Having dealt\r\nwith the metals and their compounds, and having classified all of\r\nthem that came within the range of his observation under the two heads\r\nmagnetic and diamagnetic, he began the investigation of the phenomena\r\npresented by crystals when subjected to magnetic power. This action of\r\ncrystals had been in part theoretically predicted by Poisson,[2] and\r\nactually discovered by Plucker, whose beautiful results, at the period\r\nwhich we have now reached, profoundly interested all scientific men.\r\nFaraday had been frequently puzzled by the deportment of bismuth, a\r\nhighly crystalline metal. Sometimes elongated masses of the substance\r\nrefused to set equatorially, sometimes they set persistently oblique,\r\nand sometimes even, like a magnetic body, from pole to pole.\r\n\r\n'The effect,' he says, 'occurs at a single pole; and it is then striking\r\nto observe a long piece of a substance so diamagnetic as bismuth\r\nrepelled, and yet at the same moment set round with force, axially, or\r\nend on, as a piece of magnetic substance would do.' The effect perplexed\r\nhim; and in his efforts to release himself from this perplexity, no\r\nfeature of this new manifestation of force escaped his attention. His\r\nexperiments are described in a memoir communicated to the Royal Society\r\non December 7, 1848.\r\n\r\nI have worked long myself at magne-crystallic action, amid all the light\r\nof Faraday's and Plucker's researches. The papers now before me were\r\nobjects of daily and nightly study with me eighteen or nineteen years\r\nago; but even now, though their perusal is but the last of a series of\r\nrepetitions, they astonish me. Every circumstance connected with the\r\nsubject; every shade of deportment; every variation in the energy of\r\nthe action; almost every application which could possibly be made of\r\nmagnetism to bring out in detail the character of this new force,\r\nis minutely described. The field is swept clean, and hardly anything\r\nexperimental is left for the gleaner. The phenomena, he concludes, are\r\naltogether different from those of magnetism or diamagnetism: they would\r\nappear, in fact, to present to us 'a new force, or a new form of force,\r\nin the molecules of matter,' which, for convenience sake, he designates\r\nby a new word, as 'the magne-crystallic force.'\r\n\r\nHe looks at the crystal acted upon by the magnet. From its mass he\r\npasses, in idea, to its atoms, and he asks himself whether the power\r\nwhich can thus seize upon the crystalline molecules, after they have\r\nbeen fixed in their proper positions by crystallizing force, may\r\nnot, when they are free, be able to determine their arrangement? He,\r\ntherefore, liberates the atoms by fusing the bismuth. He places the\r\nfused substance between the poles of an electro-magnet, powerfully\r\nexcited; but he fails to detect any action. I think it cannot be doubted\r\nthat an action is exerted here, that a true cause comes into play; but\r\nits magnitude is not such as sensibly to interfere with the force of\r\ncrystallization, which, in comparison with the diamagnetic force, is\r\nenormous. 'Perhaps,' adds Faraday, 'if a longer time were allowed, and\r\na permanent magnet used, a better result might be obtained. I had built\r\nmany hopes upon the process.' This expression, and his writings\r\nabound in such, illustrates what has been already said regarding his\r\nexperiments being suggested and guided by his theoretic conceptions. His\r\nmind was full of hopes and hypotheses, but he always brought them to an\r\nexperimental test. The record of his planned and executed experiments\r\nwould, I doubt not, show a high ratio of hopes disappointed to hopes\r\nfulfilled; but every case of fulfilment abolished all memory of defeat;\r\ndisappointment was swallowed up in victory.\r\n\r\nAfter the description of the general character of this new force,\r\nFaraday states with the emphasis here reproduced its mode of\r\naction: 'The law of action appears to be that the line or axis of\r\nMAGNE-CRYSTALLIC force (being the resultant of the action of all the\r\nmolecules) tends to place itself parallel, or as a tangent, to the\r\nmagnetic curve, or line of magnetic force, passing through the place\r\nwhere the crystal is situated.' The magne-crystallic force, moreover,\r\nappears to him 'to be clearly distinguished from the magnetic or\r\ndiamagnetic forces, in that it causes neither approach nor recession,\r\nconsisting not in attraction or repulsion, but in giving a certain\r\ndeterminate position to the mass under its influence.' And then he goes\r\non 'very carefully to examine and prove the conclusion that there was no\r\nconnection of the force with attractive or repulsive influences.' With\r\nthe most refined ingenuity he shows that, under certain circumstances,\r\nthe magne-crystallic force can cause the centre of gravity of a highly\r\nmagnetic body to retreat from the poles, and the centre of gravity of a\r\nhighly diamagnetic body to approach them. His experiments root his mind\r\nmore and more firmly in the conclusion that 'neither attraction nor\r\nrepulsion causes the set, or governs the final position' of the crystal\r\nin the magnetic field. That the force which does so is therefore\r\n'distinct in its character and effects from the magnetic and diamagnetic\r\nforms of force. On the other hand,' he continues, 'it has a most\r\nmanifest relation to the crystalline structure of bismuth and other\r\nbodies, and therefore to the power by which their molecules are able to\r\nbuild up the crystalline masses.'\r\n\r\nAnd here follows one of those expressions which characterize the\r\nconceptions of Faraday in regard to force generally:--'It appears to me\r\nimpossible to conceive of the results in any other way than by a mutual\r\nreaction of the magnetic force, and the force of the particles of the\r\ncrystals upon each other.' He proves that the action of the force,\r\nthough thus molecular, is an action at a distance; he shows that a\r\nbismuth crystal can cause a freely suspended magnetic needle to set\r\nparallel to its magne-crystallic axis. Few living men are aware of the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining results like this, or of the delicacy necessary\r\nto their attainment. 'But though it thus takes up the character of\r\na force acting at a distance, still it is due to that power of the\r\nparticles which makes them cohere in regular order and gives the mass\r\nits crystalline aggregation, which we call at other times the\r\nattraction of aggregation, and so often speak of as acting at insensible\r\ndistances.' Thus he broods over this new force, and looks at it from all\r\npossible points of inspection. Experiment follows experiment, as thought\r\nfollows thought. He will not relinquish the subject as long as a hope\r\nexists of throwing more light upon it. He knows full well the anomalous\r\nnature of the conclusion to which his experiments lead him. But\r\nexperiment to him is final, and he will not shrink from the conclusion.\r\n'This force,' he says, 'appears to me to be very strange and striking\r\nin its character. It is not polar, for there is no attraction\r\nor repulsion.' And then, as if startled by his own utterance, he\r\nasks--'What is the nature of the mechanical force which turns the\r\ncrystal round, and makes it affect a magnet?'... 'I do not remember,' he\r\ncontinues 'heretofore such a case of force as the present one, where a\r\nbody is brought into position only, without attraction or repulsion.'\r\n\r\nPlucker, the celebrated geometer already mentioned, who pursued\r\nexperimental physics for many years of his life with singular devotion\r\nand success, visited Faraday in those days, and repeated before him\r\nhis beautiful experiments on magneto-optic action. Faraday repeated and\r\nverified Plucker's observations, and concluded, what he at first seemed\r\nto doubt, that Plucker's results and magne-crystallic action had the\r\nsame origin.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his papers, when he takes a last look along the line of\r\nresearch, and then turns his eyes to the future, utterances quite as\r\nmuch emotional as scientific escape from Faraday. 'I cannot,' he says,\r\nat the end of his first paper on magne-crystallic action, 'conclude\r\nthis series of researches without remarking how rapidly the knowledge of\r\nmolecular forces grows upon us, and how strikingly every investigation\r\ntends to develop more and more their importance, and their extreme\r\nattraction as an object of study. A few years ago magnetism was to us an\r\noccult power, affecting only a few bodies, now it is found to influence\r\nall bodies, and to possess the most intimate relations with electricity,\r\nheat, chemical action, light, crystallization, and through it, with\r\nthe forces concerned in cohesion; and we may, in the present state of\r\nthings, well feel urged to continue in our labours, encouraged by the\r\nhope of bringing it into a bond of union with gravity itself.'\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplementary remarks\r\n\r\nA brief space will, perhaps, be granted me here to state the further\r\nprogress of an investigation which interested Faraday so much. Drawn by\r\nthe fame of Bunsen as a teacher, in the year 1848 I became a student in\r\nthe University of Marburg, in Hesse Cassel. Bunsen's behaviour to me\r\nwas that of a brother as well as that of a teacher, and it was also my\r\nhappiness to make the acquaintance and gain the friendship of Professor\r\nKnoblauch, so highly distinguished by his researches on Radiant Heat.\r\nPlucker's and Faraday's investigations filled all minds at the time,\r\nand towards the end of 1849, Professor Knoblauch and myself commenced\r\na joint investigation of the entire question. Long discipline was\r\nnecessary to give us due mastery over it. Employing a method proposed by\r\nDove, we examined the optical properties of our crystals ourselves;\r\nand these optical observations went hand in hand with our magnetic\r\nexperiments. The number of these experiments was very great, but for\r\na considerable time no fact of importance was added to those already\r\npublished. At length, however, it was our fortune to meet with various\r\ncrystals whose deportment could not be brought under the laws of\r\nmagne-crystallic action enunciated by Plucker. We also discovered\r\ninstances which led us to suppose that the magne-crystallic force was\r\nby no means independent, as alleged, of the magnetism or diamagnetism of\r\nthe mass of the crystal. Indeed, the more we worked at the subject, the\r\nmore clearly did it appear to us that the deportment of crystals in the\r\nmagnetic field was due, not to a force previously unknown, but to\r\nthe modification of the known forces of magnetism and diamagnetism by\r\ncrystalline aggregation.\r\n\r\nAn eminent example of magne-crystallic action adduced by Plucker, and\r\nexperimented on by Faraday, was Iceland spar. It is what in optics is\r\ncalled a negative crystal, and according to the law of Plucker, the axis\r\nof such a crystal was always repelled by a magnet. But we showed that it\r\nwas only necessary to substitute, in whole or in part, carbonate of iron\r\nfor carbonate of lime, thus changing the magnetic but not the optical\r\ncharacter of the crystal, to cause the axis to be attracted. That the\r\ndeportment of magnetic crystals is exactly antithetical to that of\r\ndiamagnetic crystals isomorphous with the magnetic ones, was proved\r\nto be a general law of action. In all cases, the line which in\r\na diamagnetic crystal set equatorially, always set itself in an\r\nisomorphous magnetic crystal axially. By mechanical compression other\r\nbodies were also made to imitate the Iceland spar.\r\n\r\nThese and numerous other results bearing upon the question were\r\npublished at the time in the 'Philosophical Magazine' and in\r\n'Poggendorff's Annalen'; and the investigation of diamagnetism and\r\nmagne-crystallic action was subsequently continued by me in the\r\nlaboratory of Professor Magnus of Berlin. In December, 1851, after I had\r\nquitted Germany, Dr. Bence Jones went to the Prussian capital to see\r\nthe celebrated experiments of Du Bois Reymond. Influenced, I suppose, by\r\nwhat he there heard, he afterwards invited me to give a Friday evening\r\ndiscourse at the Royal Institution. I consented, not without fear and\r\ntrembling. For the Royal Institution was to me a kind of dragon's den,\r\nwhere tact and strength would be necessary to save me from destruction.\r\nOn February 11, 1853, the discourse was given, and it ended happily.\r\nI allude to these things, that I may mention that, though my aim and\r\nobject in that lecture was to subvert the notions both of Faraday and\r\nPlucker, and to establish in opposition to their views what I regarded\r\nas the truth, it was very far from producing in Faraday either enmity or\r\nanger. At the conclusion of the lecture, he quitted his accustomed seat,\r\ncrossed the theatre to the corner into which I had shrunk, shook me by\r\nthe hand, and brought me back to the table. Once more, subsequently,\r\nand in connection with a related question, I ventured to differ from him\r\nstill more emphatically. It was done out of trust in the greatness of\r\nhis character; nor was the trust misplaced. He felt my public dissent\r\nfrom him; and it pained me afterwards to the quick to think that I had\r\ngiven him even momentary annoyance. It was, however, only momentary. His\r\nsoul was above all littleness and proof to all egotism. He was the same\r\nto me afterwards that he had been before; the very chance expression\r\nwhich led me to conclude that he felt my dissent being one of kindness\r\nand affection.\r\n\r\nIt required long subsequent effort to subdue the complications of\r\nmagne-crystallic action, and to bring under the dominion of elementary\r\nprinciples the vast mass of facts which the experiments of Faraday and\r\nPlucker had brought to light. It was proved by Reich, Edmond Becquerel,\r\nand myself, that the condition of diamagnetic bodies, in virtue of which\r\nthey were repelled by the poles of a magnet, was excited in them by\r\nthose poles; that the strength of this condition rose and fell with, and\r\nwas proportional to, the strength of the acting magnet. It was not then\r\nany property possessed permanently by the bismuth, and which merely\r\nrequired the development of magnetism to act upon it, that caused the\r\nrepulsion; for then the repulsion would have been simply proportional to\r\nthe strength of the influencing magnet, whereas experiment proved it to\r\naugment as the square of the strength. The capacity to be repelled was\r\ntherefore not inherent in the bismuth, but induced. So far an identity\r\nof action was established between magnetic and diamagnetic bodies.\r\nAfter this the deportment of magnetic bodies, 'normal' and 'abnormal';\r\ncrystalline, amorphous, and compressed, was compared with that of\r\ncrystalline, amorphous, and compressed diamagnetic bodies; and by a\r\nseries of experiments, executed in the laboratory of this Institution,\r\nthe most complete antithesis was established between magnetism and\r\ndiamagnetism. This antithesis embraced the quality of polarity,--the\r\ntheory of reversed polarity, first propounded by Faraday, being proved\r\nto be true. The discussion of the question was very brisk. On the\r\nContinent Professor Wilhelm Weber was the ablest and most successful\r\nsupporter of the doctrine of diamagnetic polarity; and it was with an\r\napparatus, devised by him and constructed under his own superintendence,\r\nby Leyser of Leipzig, that the last demands of the opponents of\r\ndiamagnetic polarity were satisfied. The establishment of this point was\r\nabsolutely necessary to the explanation of magne-crystallic action.\r\n\r\nWith that admirable instinct which always guided him, Faraday had seen\r\nthat it was possible, if not probable, that the diamagnetic force acts\r\nwith different degrees of intensity in different directions, through\r\nthe mass of a crystal. In his studies on electricity, he had sought an\r\nexperimental reply to the question whether crystalline bodies had not\r\ndifferent specific inductive capacities in different directions, but\r\nhe failed to establish any difference of the kind. His first attempt\r\nto establish differences of diamagnetic action in different directions\r\nthrough bismuth, was also a failure; but he must have felt this to be\r\na point of cardinal importance, for he returned to the subject in 1850,\r\nand proved that bismuth was repelled with different degrees of force in\r\ndifferent directions. It seemed as if the crystal were compounded of\r\ntwo diamagnetic bodies of different strengths, the substance being more\r\nstrongly repelled across the magne-crystallic axis than along it. The\r\nsame result was obtained independently, and extended to various\r\nother bodies, magnetic as well as diamagnetic, and also to compressed\r\nsubstances, a little subsequently by myself.\r\n\r\nThe law of action in relation to this point is, that in diamagnetic\r\ncrystals, the line along which the repulsion is a maximum, sets\r\nequatorially in the magnetic field; while in magnetic crystals the line\r\nalong which the attraction is a maximum sets from pole to pole. Faraday\r\nhad said that the magne-crystallic force was neither attraction nor\r\nrepulsion. Thus far he was right. It was neither taken singly, but it\r\nwas both. By the combination of the doctrine of diamagnetic polarity\r\nwith these differential attractions and repulsions, and by paying due\r\nregard to the character of the magnetic field, every fact brought\r\nto light in the domain of magne-crystallic action received complete\r\nexplanation. The most perplexing of those facts were shown to result\r\nfrom the action of mechanical couples, which the proved polarity both\r\nof magnetism and diamagnetism brought into play. Indeed the thoroughness\r\nwith which the experiments of Faraday were thus explained, is the most\r\nstriking possible demonstration of the marvellous precision with which\r\nthey were executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 11\r\n\r\n     [1] See Heat as a Mode of Motion, ninth edition, p. 75.\r\n\r\n     [2] See Sir Wm.

I am acquainted with no mind whose power\r\nand suddenness of expansion at the touch of new physical truth could be\r\nranked with his. Sometimes I have compared the action of his experiments\r\non his mind to that of highly combustible matter thrown into a furnace;\r\nevery fresh entry of fact was accompanied by the immediate development\r\nof light and heat. The light, which was intellectual, enabled him to see\r\nfar beyond the boundaries of the fact itself, and the heat, which was\r\nemotional, urged him to the conquest of this newly-revealed domain. But\r\nthough the force of his imagination was enormous, he bridled it like a\r\nmighty rider, and never permitted his intellect to be overthrown.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the expansive power which his vivid imagination conferred\r\nupon him, he rose from the smallest beginnings to the grandest ends.\r\nHaving heard from Zantedeschi that Bancalari had established the\r\nmagnetism of flame, he repeated the experiments and augmented the\r\nresults. He passed from flames to gases, examining and revealing their\r\nmagnetic and diamagnetic powers; and then he suddenly rose from his\r\nbubbles of oxygen and nitrogen to the atmospheric envelope of the\r\nearth itself, and its relations to the great question of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism. The rapidity with which these ever-augmenting thoughts\r\nassumed the form of experiments is unparalleled. His power in this\r\nrespect is often best illustrated by his minor investigations, and,\r\nperhaps, by none more strikingly than by his paper 'On the Diamagnetic\r\nCondition of Flame and Gases,' published as a letter to Mr. Richard\r\nTaylor, in the 'Philosophical Magazine' for December, 1847. After\r\nverifying, varying, and expanding the results of Bancalari, he submitted\r\nto examination heated air-currents, produced by platinum spirals placed\r\nin the magnetic field, and raised to incandescence by electricity. He\r\nthen examined the magnetic deportment of gases generally. Almost all\r\nof these gases are invisible; but he must, nevertheless, track them in\r\ntheir unseen courses. He could not effect this by mingling smoke with\r\nhis gases, for the action of his magnet upon the smoke would have\r\ntroubled his conclusions. He, therefore, 'caught' his gases in tubes,\r\ncarried them out of the magnetic field, and made them reveal themselves\r\nat a distance from the magnet.\r\n\r\nImmersing one gas in another, he determined their differential action;\r\nresults of the utmost beauty being thus arrived at. Perhaps the\r\nmost important are those obtained with atmospheric air and its two\r\nconstituents. Oxygen, in various media, was strongly attracted by the\r\nmagnet; in coal-gas, for example, it was powerfully magnetic, whereas\r\nnitrogen was diamagnetic. Some of the effects obtained with oxygen\r\nin coal-gas were strikingly beautiful. When the fumes of chloride of\r\nammonium (a diamagnetic substance) were mingled with the oxygen, the\r\ncloud of chloride behaved in a most singular manner,--'The attraction\r\nof iron filings,' says Faraday, 'to a magnetic pole is not more striking\r\nthan the appearance presented by the oxygen under these circumstances.'\r\n\r\nOn observing this deportment the question immediately occurs to\r\nhim,--Can we not separate the oxygen of the atmosphere from its nitrogen\r\nby magnetic analysis? It is the perpetual occurrence of such questions\r\nthat marks the great experimenter. The attempt to analyze atmospheric\r\nair by magnetic force proved a failure, like the previous attempt to\r\ninfluence crystallization by the magnet. The enormous comparative power\r\nof the force of crystallization I have already assigned as a reason for\r\nthe incompetence of the magnet to determine molecular arrangement; in\r\nthe present instance the magnetic analysis is opposed by the force of\r\ndiffusion, which is also very strong comparatively. The same remark\r\napplies to, and is illustrated by, another experiment subsequently\r\nexecuted by Faraday. Water is diamagnetic, sulphate of iron is strongly\r\nmagnetic. He enclosed 'a dilute solution of sulphate of iron in a tube,\r\nand placed the lower end of the tube between the poles of a powerful\r\nhorseshoe magnet for days together,' but he could produce 'no\r\nconcentration of the solution in the part near the magnet.' Here also\r\nthe diffusibility of the salt was too powerful for the force brought\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nThe experiment last referred to is recorded in a paper presented to\r\nthe Royal Society on the 2nd August, 1850, in which he pursues the\r\ninvestigation of the magnetism of gases. Newton's observations on\r\nsoap-bubbles were often referred to by Faraday. His delight in a\r\nsoap-bubble was like that of a boy, and he often introduced them into\r\nhis lectures, causing them, when filled with air, to float on invisible\r\nseas of carbonic acid, and otherwise employing them as a means of\r\nillustration. He now finds them exceedingly useful in his experiments\r\non the magnetic condition of gases. A bubble of air in a magnetic field\r\noccupied by air was unaffected, save through the feeble repulsion of its\r\nenvelope. A bubble of nitrogen, on the contrary, was repelled from the\r\nmagnetic axis with a force far surpassing that of a bubble of air.\r\nThe deportment of oxygen in air 'was very impressive, the bubble being\r\npulled inward or towards the axial line, sharply and suddenly, as if the\r\noxygen were highly magnetic.'\r\n\r\nHe next labours to establish the true magnetic zero, a problem not so\r\neasy as might at first sight be imagined. For the action of the magnet\r\nupon any gas, while surrounded by air or any other gas, can only be\r\ndifferential; and if the experiment were made in vacuo, the action of\r\nthe envelope, in this case necessarily of a certain thickness, would\r\ntrouble the result. While dealing with this subject, Faraday makes\r\nsome noteworthy observations regarding space. In reference to the\r\nTorricellian vacuum, he says, 'Perhaps it is hardly necessary for me to\r\nstate that I find both iron and bismuth in such vacua perfectly obedient\r\nto the magnet. From such experiments, and also from general observations\r\nand knowledge, it seems manifest that the lines of magnetic force can\r\ntraverse pure space, just as gravitating force does, and as statical\r\nelectrical forces do, and therefore space has a magnetic relation of its\r\nown, and one that we shall probably find hereafter to be of the utmost\r\nimportance in natural phenomena. But this character of space is not\r\nof the same kind as that which, in relation to matter, we endeavour to\r\nexpress by the terms magnetic and diamagnetic. To confuse these\r\ntogether would be to confound space with matter, and to trouble all\r\nthe conceptions by which we endeavour to understand and work out a\r\nprogressively clearer view of the mode of action, and the laws of\r\nnatural forces. It would be as if in gravitation or electric forces,\r\none were to confound the particles acting on each other with the space\r\nacross which they are acting, and would, I think, shut the door to\r\nadvancement. Mere space cannot act as matter acts, even though the\r\nutmost latitude be allowed to the hypothesis of an ether; and admitting\r\nthat hypothesis, it would be a large additional assumption to suppose\r\nthat the lines of magnetic force are vibrations carried on by it, whilst\r\nas yet we have no proof that time is required for their propagation, or\r\nin what respect they may, in general character, assimilate to or differ\r\nfrom their respective lines of gravitating, luminiferous, or electric\r\nforces.'\r\n\r\nPure space he assumes to be the true magnetic zero, but he pushes his\r\ninquiries to ascertain whether among material substances there may not\r\nbe some which resemble space. If you follow his experiments, you will\r\nsoon emerge into the light of his results. A torsion-beam was\r\nsuspended by a skein of cocoon silk; at one end of the beam was fixed\r\na cross-piece 1 1/2 inch long. Tubes of exceedingly thin glass, filled\r\nwith various gases, and hermetically sealed, were suspended in pairs\r\nfrom the two ends of the cross-piece. The position of the rotating\r\ntorsion-head was such that the two tubes were at opposite sides of,\r\nand equidistant from, the magnetic axis, that is to say from the line\r\njoining the two closely approximated polar points of an electro-magnet.\r\nHis object was to compare the magnetic action of the gases in the\r\ntwo tubes. When one tube was filled with oxygen, and the other with\r\nnitrogen, on the supervention of the magnetic force, the oxygen was\r\npulled towards the axis, the nitrogen being pushed out. By turning\r\nthe torsion-head they could be restored to their primitive position of\r\nequidistance, where it is evident the action of the glass envelopes was\r\nannulled. The amount of torsion necessary to re-establish equidistance\r\nexpressed the magnetic difference of the substances compared.\r\n\r\nAnd then he compared oxygen with oxygen at different pressures. One of\r\nhis tubes contained the gas at the pressure of 30 inches of mercury,\r\nanother at a pressure of 15 inches of mercury, a third at a pressure\r\nof 10 inches, while a fourth was exhausted as far as a good air-pump\r\nrenders exhaustion possible. 'When the first of these was compared with\r\nthe other three, the effect was most striking.' It was drawn towards\r\nthe axis when the magnet was excited, the tube containing the rarer gas\r\nbeing apparently driven away, and the greater the difference between the\r\ndensities of the two gases, the greater was the energy of this action.\r\n\r\nAnd now observe his mode of reaching a material magnetic zero. When\r\na bubble of nitrogen was exposed in air in the magnetic field, on the\r\nsupervention of the power, the bubble retreated from the magnet. A less\r\nacute observer would have set nitrogen down as diamagnetic; but Faraday\r\nknew that retreat, in a medium composed in part of oxygen, might be due\r\nto the attraction of the latter gas, instead of to the repulsion of the\r\ngas immersed in it. But if nitrogen be really diamagnetic, then a bubble\r\nor bulb filled with the dense gas will overcome one filled with the\r\nrarer gas. From the cross-piece of his torsion-balance he suspended his\r\nbulbs of nitrogen, at equal distances from the magnetic axis, and found\r\nthat the rarefaction, or the condensation of the gas in either of the\r\nbulbs had not the slightest influence. When the magnetic force was\r\ndeveloped, the bulbs remained in their first position, even when one\r\nwas filled with nitrogen, and the other as far as possible exhausted.\r\nNitrogen, in fact, acted 'like space itself'; it was neither magnetic\r\nnor diamagnetic.\r\n\r\nHe cannot conveniently compare the paramagnetic force of oxygen with\r\niron, in consequence of the exceeding magnetic intensity of the latter\r\nsubstance; but he does compare it with the sulphate of iron, and finds\r\nthat, bulk for bulk, oxygen is equally magnetic with a solution of this\r\nsubstance in water 'containing seventeen times the weight of the oxygen\r\nin crystallized proto-sulphate of iron, or 3.4 times its weight of\r\nmetallic iron in that state of combination.' By its capability to\r\ndeflect a fine glass fibre, he finds that the attraction of this bulb\r\nof oxygen, containing only 0.117 of a grain of the gas, at an average\r\ndistance of more than an inch from the magnetic axis, is about equal to\r\nthe gravitating force of the same amount of oxygen as expressed by its\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThese facts could not rest for an instant in the mind of Faraday without\r\nreceiving that expansion to which I have already referred. 'It is hardly\r\nnecessary,' he writes, 'for me to say here that this oxygen cannot exist\r\nin the atmosphere exerting such a remarkable and high amount of magnetic\r\nforce, without having a most important influence on the disposition of\r\nthe magnetism of the earth, as a planet; especially if it be remembered\r\nthat its magnetic condition is greatly altered by variations of its\r\ndensity and by variations of its temperature. I think I see here the\r\nreal cause of many of the variations of that force, which have been, and\r\nare now so carefully watched on different parts of the surface of the\r\nglobe. The daily variation, and the annual variation, both seem likely\r\nto come under it; also very many of the irregular continual variations,\r\nwhich the photographic process of record renders so beautifully\r\nmanifest. If such expectations be confirmed, and the influence of the\r\natmosphere be found able to produce results like these, then we shall\r\nprobably find a new relation between the aurora borealis and the\r\nmagnetism of the earth, namely, a relation established, more or less,\r\nthrough the air itself in connection with the space above it; and even\r\nmagnetic relations and variations, which are not as yet suspected,\r\nmay be suggested and rendered manifest and measurable, in the further\r\ndevelopment of what I will venture to call Atmospheric Magnetism. I may\r\nbe over-sanguine in these expectations, but as yet I am sustained in\r\nthem by the apparent reality, simplicity, and sufficiency of the\r\ncause assumed, as it at present appears to my mind. As soon as I\r\nhave submitted these views to a close consideration, and the test of\r\naccordance with observation, and, where applicable, with experiments\r\nalso, I will do myself the honour to bring them before the Royal\r\nSociety.'\r\n\r\nTwo elaborate memoirs are then devoted to the subject of Atmospheric\r\nMagnetism; the first sent to the Royal Society on the 9th of October,\r\nand the second on the 19th of November, 1850. In these memoirs he\r\ndiscusses the effects of heat and cold upon the magnetism of the air,\r\nand the action on the magnetic needle, which must result from thermal\r\nchanges. By the convergence and divergence of the lines of terrestrial\r\nmagnetic force, he shows how the distribution of magnetism, in\r\nthe earth's atmosphere, is effected. He applies his results to the\r\nexplanation of the Annual and of the Diurnal Variation: he also\r\nconsiders irregular variations, including the action of magnetic storms.\r\nHe discusses, at length, the observations at St. Petersburg, Greenwich,\r\nHobarton, St. Helena, Toronto, and the Cape of Good Hope; believing\r\nthat the facts, revealed by his experiments, furnish the key to the\r\nvariations observed at all these places.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1851, I had the honour of an interview with Humboldt, in\r\nBerlin, and his parting words to me then were, 'Tell Faraday that I\r\nentirely agree with him, and that he has, in my opinion, completely\r\nexplained the variation of the declination.' Eminent men have since\r\ninformed me that Humboldt was hasty in expressing this opinion. In\r\nfact, Faraday's memoirs on atmospheric magnetism lost much of their\r\nforce--perhaps too much--through the important discovery of the relation\r\nof the variation of the declination to the number of the solar spots.\r\nBut I agree with him and M. Edmond Becquerel, who worked independently\r\nat this subject, in thinking, that a body so magnetic as oxygen,\r\nswathing the earth, and subject to variations of temperature, diurnal\r\nand annual, must affect the manifestations of terrestrial magnetism.[1]\r\nThe air that stands upon a single square foot of the earth's surface\r\nis, according to Faraday, equivalent in magnetic force to 8160 lbs.\r\nof crystallized protosulphate of iron. Such a substance cannot be\r\nabsolutely neutral as regards the deportment of the magnetic needle. But\r\nFaraday's writings on this subject are so voluminous, and the theoretic\r\npoints are so novel and intricate, that I shall postpone the complete\r\nanalysis of these researches to a time when I can lay hold of them more\r\ncompletely than my other duties allow me to do now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote to Chapter 12\r\n\r\n     [1] This persuasion has been greatly strengthened by the\r\n     recent perusal of a paper by Mr. Baxendell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13.\r\n\r\n     Speculations: nature of matter: lines of force\r\n\r\nThe scientific picture of Faraday would not be complete without a\r\nreference to his speculative writings. On Friday, January 19, 1844,\r\nhe opened the weekly evening-meetings of the Royal Institution by a\r\ndiscourse entitled 'A speculation touching Electric Conduction and the\r\nnature of Matter.' In this discourse he not only attempts the overthrow\r\nof Dalton's Theory of Atoms, but also the subversion of all ordinary\r\nscientific ideas regarding the nature and relations of Matter and Force.\r\nHe objected to the use of the term atom:--'I have not yet found a\r\nmind,' he says, 'that did habitually separate it from its accompanying\r\ntemptations; and there can be no doubt that the words definite\r\nproportions, equivalent, primes, &c., which did and do fully express all\r\nthe facts of what is usually called the atomic theory in chemistry, were\r\ndismissed because they were not expressive enough, and did not say all\r\nthat was in the mind of him who used the word atom in their stead.'\r\n\r\nA moment will be granted me to indicate my own view of Faraday's\r\nposition here. The word 'atom' was not used in the stead of definite\r\nproportions, equivalents, or primes. These terms represented facts that\r\nfollowed from, but were not equivalent to, the atomic theory. Facts\r\ncannot satisfy the mind: and the law of definite combining proportions\r\nbeing once established, the question 'why should combination take place\r\naccording to that law?' is inevitable. Dalton answered this question by\r\nthe enunciation of the Atomic Theory, the fundamental idea of which\r\nis, in my opinion, perfectly secure. The objection of Faraday to Dalton\r\nmight be urged with the same substantial force against Newton: it might\r\nbe stated with regard to the planetary motions that the laws of\r\nKepler revealed the facts; that the introduction of the principle of\r\ngravitation was an addition to the facts. But this is the essence of\r\nall theory. The theory is the backward guess from fact to principle;\r\nthe conjecture, or divination regarding something, which lies behind\r\nthe facts, and from which they flow in necessary sequence. If Dalton's\r\ntheory, then, account for the definite proportions observed in the\r\ncombinations of chemistry, its justification rests upon the same basis\r\nas that of the principle of gravitation. All that can in strictness be\r\nsaid in either case is that the facts occur as if the principle existed.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Faraday himself habitually deals with his hypotheses\r\nis revealed in this lecture. He incessantly employed them to gain\r\nexperimental ends, but he incessantly took them down, as an architect\r\nremoves the scaffolding when the edifice is complete. 'I cannot but\r\ndoubt,' he says, 'that he who as a mere philosopher has most power of\r\npenetrating the secrets of nature, and guessing by hypothesis at her\r\nmode of working, will also be most careful for his own safe progress\r\nand that of others, to distinguish the knowledge which consists of\r\nassumption, by which I mean theory and hypothesis, from that which is\r\nthe knowledge of facts and laws.' Faraday himself, in fact, was\r\nalways 'guessing by hypothesis,' and making theoretic divination the\r\nstepping-stone to his experimental results.\r\n\r\nI have already more than once dwelt on the vividness with which he\r\nrealised molecular conditions; we have a fine example of this strength\r\nand brightness of imagination in the present 'speculation.' He grapples\r\nwith the notion that matter is made up of particles, not in absolute\r\ncontact, but surrounded by interatomic space. 'Space,' he observes,\r\n'must be taken as the only continuous part of a body so constituted.\r\nSpace will permeate all masses of matter in every direction like a net,\r\nexcept that in place of meshes it will form cells, isolating each atom\r\nfrom its neighbours, itself only being continuous.'\r\n\r\nLet us follow out this notion; consider, he argues, the case of a\r\nnon-conductor of electricity, such for example as shell-lac, with its\r\nmolecules, and intermolecular spaces running through the mass. In its\r\ncase space must be an insulator; for if it were a conductor it would\r\nresemble 'a fine metallic web,' penetrating the lac in every direction.\r\nBut the fact is that it resembles the wax of black sealing-wax, which\r\nsurrounds and insulates the particles of conducting carbon, interspersed\r\nthroughout its mass. In the case of shell-lac, therefore, space is an\r\ninsulator.\r\n\r\nBut now, take the case of a conducting metal. Here we have, as before,\r\nthe swathing of space round every atom. If space be an insulator there\r\ncan be no transmission of electricity from atom to atom. But there is\r\ntransmission; hence space is a conductor. Thus he endeavours to hamper\r\nthe atomic theory. 'The reasoning,' he says, 'ends in a subversion of\r\nthat theory altogether; for if space be an insulator it cannot exist\r\nin conducting bodies, and if it be a conductor it cannot exist in\r\ninsulating bodies. Any ground of reasoning,' he adds, as if carried away\r\nby the ardour of argument, 'which tends to such conclusions as these\r\nmust in itself be false.'\r\n\r\nHe then tosses the atomic theory from horn to horn of his dilemmas. What\r\ndo we know, he asks, of the atom apart from its force? You imagine a\r\nnucleus which may be called a, and surround it by forces which may\r\nbe called m; 'to my mind the a or nucleus vanishes, and the substance\r\nconsists in the powers of m. And indeed what notion can we form of the\r\nnucleus independent of its powers? What thought remains on which to hang\r\nthe imagination of an a independent of the acknowledged forces?' Like\r\nBoscovich, he abolishes the atom, and puts a 'centre of force' in its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWith his usual courage and sincerity he pushes his view to its utmost\r\nconsequences. 'This view of the constitution of matter,' he continues,\r\n'would seem to involve necessarily the conclusion that matter fills\r\nall space, or at least all space to which gravitation extends; for\r\ngravitation is a property of matter dependent on a certain force, and it\r\nis this force which constitutes the matter. In that view matter is\r\nnot merely mutually penetrable;[1] but each atom extends, so to say,\r\nthroughout the whole of the solar system, yet always retaining its own\r\ncentre of force.'\r\n\r\nIt is the operation of a mind filled with thoughts of this profound,\r\nstrange, and subtle character that we have to take into account in\r\ndealing with Faraday's later researches. A similar cast of thought\r\npervades a letter addressed by Faraday to Mr. Richard Phillips, and\r\npublished in the 'Philosophical Magazine' for May, 1846. It is entitled\r\n'Thoughts on Ray-vibrations,' and it contains one of the most singular\r\nspeculations that ever emanated from a scientific mind. It must be\r\nremembered here, that though Faraday lived amid such speculations he did\r\nnot rate them highly, and that he was prepared at any moment to change\r\nthem or let them go. They spurred him on, but they did not hamper him.\r\nHis theoretic notions were fluent; and when minds less plastic than his\r\nown attempted to render those fluxional images rigid, he rebelled. He\r\nwarns Phillips moreover, that from first to last, 'he merely threw out\r\nas matter for speculation the vague impressions of his mind; for he gave\r\nnothing as the result of sufficient consideration, or as the settled\r\nconviction, or even probable conclusion at which he had arrived.'\r\n\r\nThe gist of this communication is that gravitating force acts in lines\r\nacross space, and that the vibrations of light and radiant heat consist\r\nin the tremors of these lines of force. 'This notion,' he says, 'as far\r\nas it is admitted, will dispense with the ether, which, in another view\r\nis supposed to be the medium in which these vibrations take place.' And\r\nhe adds further on, that his view 'endeavours to dismiss the ether but\r\nnot the vibrations.' The idea here set forth is the natural supplement\r\nof his previous notion, that it is gravitating force which constitutes\r\nmatter, each atom extending, so to say, throughout the whole of the\r\nsolar system.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Mr. Phillips winds up with this beautiful conclusion:--\r\n\r\n'I think it likely that I have made many mistakes in the preceding\r\npages, for even to myself my ideas on this point appear only as the\r\nshadow of a speculation, or as one of those impressions upon the mind\r\nwhich are allowable for a time as guides to thought and research. He who\r\nlabours in experimental inquiries, knows how numerous these are, and how\r\noften their apparent fitness and beauty vanish before the progress and\r\ndevelopment of real natural truth.'\r\n\r\nLet it then be remembered that Faraday entertained notions regarding\r\nmatter and force altogether distinct from the views generally held by\r\nscientific men. Force seemed to him an entity dwelling along the line in\r\nwhich it is exerted. The lines along which gravity acts between the sun\r\nand earth seem figured in his mind as so many elastic strings; indeed\r\nhe accepts the assumed instantaneity of gravity as the expression of the\r\nenormous elasticity of the 'lines of weight.' Such views, fruitful in\r\nthe case of magnetism, barren, as yet, in the case of gravity, explain\r\nhis efforts to transform this latter force. When he goes into the open\r\nair and permits his helices to fall, to his mind's eye they are\r\ntearing through the lines of gravitating power, and hence his hope and\r\nconviction that an effect would and ought to be produced. It must\r\never be borne in mind that Faraday's difficulty in dealing with these\r\nconceptions was at bottom the same as that of Newton; that he is in\r\nfact trying to overleap this difficulty, and with it probably the limits\r\nprescribed to the intellect itself.\r\n\r\nThe idea of lines of magnetic force was suggested to Faraday by the\r\nlinear arrangement of iron filings when scattered over a magnet. He\r\nspeaks of and illustrates by sketches, the deflection, both convergent\r\nand divergent, of the lines of force, when they pass respectively\r\nthrough magnetic and diamagnetic bodies. These notions of concentration\r\nand divergence are also based on the direct observation of his filings.\r\nSo long did he brood upon these lines; so habitually did he associate\r\nthem with his experiments on induced currents, that the association\r\nbecame 'indissoluble,' and he could not think without them. 'I have been\r\nso accustomed,' he writes, 'to employ them, and especially in my last\r\nresearches, that I may have unwittingly become prejudiced in their\r\nfavour, and ceased to be a clear-sighted judge. Still, I have always\r\nendeavoured to make experiment the test and controller of theory\r\nand opinion; but neither by that nor by close cross-examination in\r\nprinciple, have I been made aware of any error involved in their use.'\r\n\r\nIn his later researches on magne-crystallic action, the idea of lines of\r\nforce is extensively employed; it indeed led him to an experiment which\r\nlies at the root of the whole question. In his subsequent researches on\r\nAtmospheric Magnetism the idea receives still wider application, showing\r\nitself to be wonderfully flexible and convenient. Indeed without this\r\nconception the attempt to seize upon the magnetic actions, possible or\r\nactual, of the atmosphere would be difficult in the extreme; but the\r\nnotion of lines of force, and of their divergence and convergence,\r\nguides Faraday without perplexity through all the intricacies of the\r\nquestion. After the completion of those researches, and in a paper\r\nforwarded to the Royal Society on October 22, 1851, he devotes himself\r\nto the formal development and illustration of his favourite idea. The\r\npaper bears the title, 'On lines of magnetic force, their definite\r\ncharacter, and their distribution within a magnet and through space.'\r\nA deep reflectiveness is the characteristic of this memoir. In his\r\nexperiments, which are perfectly beautiful and profoundly suggestive, he\r\ntakes but a secondary delight. His object is to illustrate the utility\r\nof his conception of lines of force. 'The study of these lines,' he\r\nsays, 'has at different times been greatly influential in leading me to\r\nvarious results which I think prove their utility as well as fertility.'\r\n\r\nFaraday for a long period used the lines of force merely as 'a\r\nrepresentative idea.' He seemed for a time averse to going further in\r\nexpression than the lines themselves, however much further he may\r\nhave gone in idea. That he believed them to exist at all times round a\r\nmagnet, and irrespective of the existence of magnetic matter, such as\r\niron filings, external to the magnet, is certain. No doubt the space\r\nround every magnet presented itself to his imagination as traversed by\r\nloops of magnetic power; but he was chary in speaking of the physical\r\nsubstratum of those loops. Indeed it may be doubted whether the physical\r\ntheory of lines of force presented itself with any distinctness to his\r\nown mind. The possible complicity of the luminiferous ether in magnetic\r\nphenomena was certainly in his thoughts. 'How the magnetic force,' he\r\nwrites, 'is transferred through bodies or through space we know not;\r\nwhether the result is merely action at a distance, as in the case of\r\ngravity; or by some intermediate agency, as in the case of light, heat,\r\nthe electric current, and (as I believe) static electric action. The\r\nidea of magnetic fluids, as applied by some, or of Magnetic centres of\r\naction, does not include that of the latter kind of transmission, but\r\nthe idea of lines of force does.' And he continues thus:--'I am more\r\ninclined to the notion that in the transmission of the [magnetic] force\r\nthere is such an action [an intermediate agency] external to the magnet,\r\nthan that the effects are merely attraction and repulsion at a distance.\r\nSuch an affection may be a function of the ether; for it is not at all\r\nunlikely that, if there be an ether, it should have other uses than\r\nsimply the conveyance of radiations.' When he speaks of the magnet in\r\ncertain cases, 'revolving amongst its own forces,' he appears to have\r\nsome conception of this kind in view.\r\n\r\nA great part of the investigation completed in October, 1851, was\r\ntaken up with the motions of wires round the poles of a magnet and the\r\nconverse. He carried an insulated wire along the axis of a bar magnet\r\nfrom its pole to its equator, where it issued from the magnet, and was\r\nbent up so as to connect its two ends. A complete circuit, no part of\r\nwhich was in contact with the magnet, was thus obtained. He found that\r\nwhen the magnet and the external wire were rotated together no current\r\nwas produced; whereas, when either of them was rotated and the other\r\nleft at rest currents were evolved. He then abandoned the axial wire,\r\nand allowed the magnet itself to take its place; the result was the\r\nsame.[2] It was the relative motion of the magnet and the loop that was\r\neffectual in producing a current.\r\n\r\nThe lines of force have their roots in the magnet, and though they may\r\nexpand into infinite space, they eventually return to the magnet. Now\r\nthese lines may be intersected close to the magnet or at a distance from\r\nit. Faraday finds distance to be perfectly immaterial so long as the\r\nnumber of lines intersected is the same. For example, when the loop\r\nconnecting the equator and the pole of his barmagnet performs one\r\ncomplete revolution round the magnet, it is manifest that all the lines\r\nof force issuing from the magnet are once intersected. Now it matters\r\nnot whether the loop be ten feet or ten inches in length, it matters\r\nnot how it may be twisted and contorted, it matters not how near to the\r\nmagnet or how distant from it the loop may be, one revolution always\r\nproduces the same amount of current electricity, because in all\r\nthese cases all the lines of force issuing from the magnet are once\r\nintersected and no more.\r\n\r\nFrom the external portion of the circuit he passes in idea to the\r\ninternal, and follows the lines of force into the body of the magnet\r\nitself. His conclusion is that there exist lines of force within the\r\nmagnet of the same nature as those without. What is more, they are\r\nexactly equal in amount to those without. They have a relation in\r\ndirection to those without; and in fact are continuations of them....\r\n'Every line of force, therefore, at whatever distance it may be taken\r\nfrom the magnet, must be considered as a closed circuit, passing in some\r\npart of its course through the magnet, and having an equal amount of\r\nforce in every part of its course.'\r\n\r\nAll the results here described were obtained with moving metals. 'But,'\r\nhe continues with profound sagacity, 'mere motion would not generate a\r\nrelation, which had not a foundation in the existence of some previous\r\nstate; and therefore the quiescent metals must be in some relation to\r\nthe active centre of force,' that is to the magnet. He here touches the\r\ncore of the whole question, and when we can state the condition into\r\nwhich the conducting wire is thrown before it is moved, we shall then\r\nbe in a position to understand the physical constitution of the electric\r\ncurrent generated by its motion.\r\n\r\nIn this inquiry Faraday worked with steel magnets, the force of which\r\nvaries with the distance from the magnet. He then sought a uniform field\r\nof magnetic force, and found it in space as affected by the magnetism\r\nof the earth. His next memoir, sent to the Royal Society, December 31,\r\n1851, is 'on the employment of the Induced Magnetoelectro Current as a\r\ntest and measure of magnetic forces.' He forms rectangles and rings, and\r\nby ingenious and simple devices collects the opposed currents which are\r\ndeveloped in them by rotation across the terrestrial lines of magnetic\r\nforce. He varies the shapes of his rectangles while preserving their\r\nareas constant, and finds that the constant area produces always the\r\nsame amount of current per revolution. The current depends solely on\r\nthe number of lines of force intersected, and when this number is kept\r\nconstant the current remains constant too. Thus the lines of magnetic\r\nforce are continually before his eyes, by their aid he colligates his\r\nfacts, and through the inspirations derived from them he vastly expands\r\nthe boundaries of our experimental knowledge. The beauty and exactitude\r\nof the results of this investigation are extraordinary. I cannot\r\nhelp thinking while I dwell upon them, that this discovery of\r\nmagneto-electricity is the greatest experimental result ever obtained by\r\nan investigator. It is the Mont Blanc of Faraday's own achievements.\r\nHe always worked at great elevations, but a higher than this he never\r\nsubsequently attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 13\r\n\r\n     [1] He compares the interpenetration of two atoms to the\r\n     coalescence of two distinct waves, which though for a moment\r\n     blended to a single mass, preserve their individuality, and\r\n     afterwards separate.\r\n\r\n     [2] In this form the experiment is identical with one made\r\n     twenty years earlier.  See page 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14.\r\n\r\n     Unity and convertibility of natural forces: theory of the\r\n     electric current.\r\n\r\nThe terms unity and convertibility, as applied to natural forces, are\r\noften employed in these investigations, many profound and beautiful\r\nthoughts respecting these subjects being expressed in Faraday's memoirs.\r\nModern inquiry has, however, much augmented our knowledge of the\r\nrelationship of natural forces, and it seems worth while to say a few\r\nwords here, tending to clear up certain misconceptions which appear to\r\nexist among philosophic writers regarding this relationship.\r\n\r\nThe whole stock of energy or working-power in the world consists of\r\nattractions, repulsions, and motions. If the attractions and repulsions\r\nare so circumstanced as to be able to produce motion, they are sources\r\nof working-power, but not otherwise. Let us for the sake of simplicity\r\nconfine our attention to the case of attraction. The attraction exerted\r\nbetween the earth and a body at a distance from the earth's surface is\r\na source of working-power; because the body can be moved by the\r\nattraction, and in falling to the earth can perform work. When it rests\r\nupon the earth's surface it is not a source of power or energy, because\r\nit can fall no further. But though it has ceased to be a source of\r\nenergy, the attraction of gravity still acts as a force, which holds the\r\nearth and weight together.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to attracting atoms and molecules. As long as\r\ndistance separates them, they can move across it in obedience to the\r\nattraction, and the motion thus produced may, by proper appliances,\r\nbe caused to perform mechanical work. When, for example, two atoms of\r\nhydrogen unite with one of oxygen, to form water the atoms are first\r\ndrawn towards each other--they move, they clash, and then by virtue of\r\ntheir resiliency, they recoil and quiver. To this quivering motion\r\nwe give the name of heat. Now this quivering motion is merely the\r\nredistribution of the motion produced by the chemical affinity; and this\r\nis the only sense in which chemical affinity can be said to be converted\r\ninto heat. We must not imagine the chemical attraction destroyed, or\r\nconverted into anything else. For the atoms, when mutually clasped to\r\nform a molecule of water, are held together by the very attraction which\r\nfirst drew them towards each other. That which has really been expended\r\nis the pull exerted through the space by which the distance between the\r\natoms has been diminished.\r\n\r\nIf this be understood, it will be at once seen that gravity may in this\r\nsense be said to be convertible into heat; that it is in reality no more\r\nan outstanding and inconvertible agent, as it is sometimes stated to\r\nbe, than chemical affinity. By the exertion of a certain pull, through\r\na certain space, a body is caused to clash with a certain definite\r\nvelocity against the earth. Heat is thereby developed, and this is the\r\nonly sense in which gravity can be said to be converted into heat. In no\r\ncase is the force which produces the motion annihilated or changed into\r\nanything else. The mutual attraction of the earth and weight exists when\r\nthey are in contact as when they were separate; but the ability of that\r\nattraction to employ itself in the production of motion does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe transformation, in this case, is easily followed by the mind's\r\neye. First, the weight as a whole is set in motion by the attraction\r\nof gravity. This motion of the mass is arrested by collision with the\r\nearth; being broken up into molecular tremors, to which we give the name\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\nAnd when we reverse the process, and employ those tremors of heat to\r\nraise a weight, as is done through the intermediation of an elastic\r\nfluid in the steam-engine, a certain definite portion of the molecular\r\nmotion is destroyed in raising the weight. In this sense, and this\r\nsense only, can the heat be said to be converted into gravity, or\r\nmore correctly, into potential energy of gravity. It is not that the\r\ndestruction of the heat has created any new attraction, but simply that\r\nthe old attraction has now a power conferred upon it, of exerting a\r\ncertain definite pull in the interval between the starting-point of the\r\nfalling weight and its collision with the earth.\r\n\r\nSo also as regards magnetic attraction: when a sphere of iron placed\r\nat some distance from a magnet rushes towards the magnet, and has its\r\nmotion stopped by collision, an effect mechanically the same as that\r\nproduced by the attraction of gravity occurs. The magnetic attraction\r\ngenerates the motion of the mass, and the stoppage of that motion\r\nproduces heat. In this sense, and in this sense only, is there a\r\ntransformation of magnetic work into heat. And if by the mechanical\r\naction of heat, brought to bear by means of a suitable machine, the\r\nsphere be torn from the magnet and again placed at a distance, a power\r\nof exerting a pull through that distance, and producing a new motion of\r\nthe sphere, is thereby conferred upon the magnet; in this sense, and in\r\nthis sense only, is the heat converted into magnetic potential energy.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, writers on the conservation of energy speak of tensions\r\nbeing 'consumed' and 'generated,' they do not mean thereby that old\r\nattractions have been annihilated and new ones brought into existence,\r\nbut that, in the one case, the power of the attraction to produce\r\nmotion has been diminished by the shortening of the distance between\r\nthe attracting bodies, and that in the other case the power of producing\r\nmotion has been augmented by the increase of the distance. These remarks\r\napply to all bodies, whether they be sensible masses or molecules.\r\n\r\nOf the inner quality that enables matter to attract matter we know\r\nnothing; and the law of conservation makes no statement regarding that\r\nquality. It takes the facts of attraction as they stand, and affirms\r\nonly the constancy of working-power. That power may exist in the form\r\nof MOTION; or it may exist in the form of FORCE, with distance to act\r\nthrough. The former is dynamic energy, the latter is potential\r\nenergy, the constancy of the sum of both being affirmed by the law of\r\nconservation. The convertibility of natural forces consists solely\r\nin transformations of dynamic into potential, and of potential into\r\ndynamic, energy, which are incessantly going on. In no other sense has\r\nthe convertibility of force, at present, any scientific meaning.\r\n\r\nBy the contraction of a muscle a man lifts a weight from the earth. But\r\nthe muscle can contract only through the oxidation of its own tissue or\r\nof the blood passing through it. Molecular motion is thus converted into\r\nmechanical motion. Supposing the muscle to contract without raising the\r\nweight, oxidation would also occur, but the whole of the heat produced\r\nby this oxidation would be liberated in the muscle itself. Not so when\r\nit performs external work; to do that work a certain definite portion of\r\nthe heat of oxidation must be expended. It is so expended in pulling the\r\nweight away from the earth. If the weight be permitted to fall, the heat\r\ngenerated by its collision with the earth would exactly make up for that\r\nlacking in the muscle during the lifting of the weight. In the case\r\nhere supposed, we have a conversion of molecular muscular action into\r\npotential energy of gravity; and a conversion of that potential energy\r\ninto heat; the heat, however, appearing at a distance from its real\r\norigin in the muscle. The whole process consists of a transference of\r\nmolecular motion from the muscle to the weight, and gravitating force is\r\nthe mere go-between, by means of which the transference is effected.\r\n\r\nThese considerations will help to clear our way to the conception of\r\nthe transformations which occur when a wire is moved across the lines\r\nof force in a magnetic field. In this case it is commonly said we have\r\na conversion of magnetism into electricity. But let us endeavour to\r\nunderstand what really occurs. For the sake of simplicity, and with a\r\nview to its translation into a different one subsequently, let us adopt\r\nfor a moment the provisional conception of a mixed fluid in the wire,\r\ncomposed of positive and negative electricities in equal quantities, and\r\ntherefore perfectly neutralizing each other when the wire is still. By\r\nthe motion of the wire, say with the hand, towards the magnet, what the\r\nGermans call a Scheidungs-Kraft--a separating force--is brought into\r\nplay. This force tears the mixed fluids asunder, and drives them in\r\ntwo currents, the one positive and the other negative, in two opposite\r\ndirections through the wire. The presence of these currents evokes a\r\nforce of repulsion between the magnet and the wire; and to cause the one\r\nto approach the other, this repulsion must be overcome. The overcoming\r\nof this repulsion is, in fact, the work done in separating and impelling\r\nthe two electricities. When the wire is moved away from the magnet, a\r\nScheidungs-Kraft, or separating force, also comes into play; but now it\r\nis an attraction that has to be surmounted. In surmounting it, currents\r\nare developed in directions opposed to the former; positive takes the\r\nplace of negative, and negative the place of positive; the overcoming of\r\nthe attraction being the work done in separating and impelling the two\r\nelectricities.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical action occurring here is different from that occurring\r\nwhere a sphere of soft iron is withdrawn from a magnet, and again\r\nattracted. In this case muscular force is expended during the act of\r\nseparation; but the attraction of the magnet effects the reunion. In the\r\ncase of the moving wire also we overcome a resistance in separating it\r\nfrom the magnet, and thus far the action is mechanically the same as the\r\nseparation of the sphere of iron. But after the wire has ceased moving,\r\nthe attraction ceases; and so far from any action occurring similar to\r\nthat which draws the iron sphere back to the magnet, we have to overcome\r\na repulsion to bring them together.\r\n\r\nThere is no potential energy conferred either by the removal or by\r\nthe approach of the wire, and the only power really transformed or\r\nconverted, in the experiment, is muscular power. Nothing that could in\r\nstrictness be called a conversion of magnetism into electricity occurs.\r\nThe muscular oxidation that moves the wire fails to produce within the\r\nmuscle its due amount of heat, a portion of that heat, equivalent to the\r\nresistance overcome, appearing in the moving wire instead.\r\n\r\nIs this effect an attraction and a repulsion at a distance? If so, why\r\nshould both cease when the wire ceases to move? In fact, the deportment\r\nof the wire resembles far more that of a body moving in a resisting\r\nmedium than anything else; the resistance ceasing when the motion is\r\nsuspended. Let us imagine the case of a liquid so mobile that the hand\r\nmay be passed through it to and fro, without encountering any sensible\r\nresistance. It resembles the motion of a conductor in the unexcited\r\nfield of an electro-magnet. Now, let us suppose a body placed in\r\nthe liquid, or acting on it, which confers upon it the property of\r\nviscosity; the hand would no longer move freely. During its motion, but\r\nthen only, resistance would be encountered and overcome. Here we have\r\nrudely represented the case of the excited magnetic field, and the\r\nresult in both cases would be substantially the same. In both cases heat\r\nwould, in the end, be generated outside of the muscle, its amount being\r\nexactly equivalent to the resistance overcome.\r\n\r\nLet us push the analogy a little further; suppose in the case of the\r\nfluid rendered viscous, as assumed a moment ago, the viscosity not to be\r\nso great as to prevent the formation of ripples when the hand is passed\r\nthrough the liquid. Then the motion of the hand, before its final\r\nconversion into heat, would exist for a time as wave-motion, which, on\r\nsubsiding, would generate its due equivalent of heat. This intermediate\r\nstage, in the case of our moving wire, is represented by the period\r\nduring which the electric current is flowing through it; but that\r\ncurrent, like the ripples of our liquid, soon subsides, being, like\r\nthem, converted into heat.\r\n\r\nDo these words shadow forth anything like the reality? Such speculations\r\ncannot be injurious if they are enunciated without dogmatism. I do\r\nconfess that ideas such as these here indicated exercise a strong\r\nfascination on my mind. Is then the magnetic field really viscous,\r\nand if so, what substance exists in it and the wire to produce the\r\nviscosity? Let us first look at the proved effects, and afterwards turn\r\nour thoughts back upon their cause. When the wire approaches the magnet,\r\nan action is evoked within it, which travels through it with a velocity\r\ncomparable to that of light. One substance only in the universe has\r\nbeen hitherto proved competent to transmit power at this velocity;\r\nthe luminiferous ether. Not only its rapidity of progression, but its\r\nability to produce the motion of light and heat, indicates that the\r\nelectric current is also motion.[1] Further, there is a striking\r\nresemblance between the action of good and bad conductors as regards\r\nelectricity, and the action of diathermanous and adiathermanous bodies\r\nas regards radiant heat. The good conductor is diathermanous to the\r\nelectric current; it allows free transmission without the development of\r\nheat. The bad conductor is adiathermanous to the electric current, and\r\nhence the passage of the latter is accompanied by the development of\r\nheat. I am strongly inclined to hold the electric current, pure and\r\nsimple, to be a motion of the ether alone; good conductors being so\r\nconstituted that the motion may be propagated through their ether\r\nwithout sensible transfer to their atoms, while in the case of bad\r\nconductors this transfer is effected, the transferred motion appearing\r\nas heat.[2]\r\n\r\nI do not know whether Faraday would have subscribed to what is here\r\nwritten; probably his habitual caution would have prevented him from\r\ncommitting himself to anything so definite. But some such idea filled\r\nhis mind and coloured his language through all the later years of his\r\nlife. I dare not say that he has been always successful in the treatment\r\nof these theoretic notions. In his speculations he mixes together light\r\nand darkness in varying proportions, and carries us along with him\r\nthrough strong alternations of both. It is impossible to say how a\r\ncertain amount of mathematical training would have affected his work.\r\nWe cannot say what its influence would have been upon that force of\r\ninspiration that urged him on; whether it would have daunted him, and\r\nprevented him from driving his adits into places where no theory pointed\r\nto a lode. If so, then we may rejoice that this strong delver at the\r\nmine of natural knowledge was left free to wield his mattock in his own\r\nway. It must be admitted, that Faraday's purely speculative writings\r\noften lack that precision which the mathematical habit of thought\r\nconfers. Still across them flash frequent gleams of prescient wisdom\r\nwhich will excite admiration throughout all time; while the facts,\r\nrelations, principles, and laws which his experiments have established\r\nare sure to form the body of grand theories yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes to Chapter 14\r\n\r\n     [1] Mr. Clerk Maxwell has recently published an exceedingly\r\n     important investigation connected with this question.  Even\r\n     in the non-mathematical portions of the memoirs of Mr.\r\n     Maxwell, the admirable spirit of his philosophy is\r\n     sufficiently revealed. As regards the employment of\r\n     scientific imagery, I hardly know his equal in power of\r\n     conception and clearness of definition.\r\n\r\n     [2] One important difference, of course, exists between the\r\n     effect of motion in the magnetic field, and motion in a\r\n     resisting medium. In the former case the heat is generated\r\n     in the moving conductor, in the latter it is in part\r\n     generated in the medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15.\r\n\r\n     Summary.\r\n\r\nWhen from an Alpine height the eye of the climber ranges over the\r\nmountains, he finds that for the most part they resolve themselves into\r\ndistinct groups, each consisting of a dominant mass surrounded by peaks\r\nof lesser elevation. The power which lifted the mightier eminences, in\r\nnearly all cases lifted others to an almost equal height. And so it is\r\nwith the discoveries of Faraday. As a general rule, the dominant result\r\ndoes not stand alone, but forms the culminating point of a vast and\r\nvaried mass of inquiry. In this way, round about his great discovery of\r\nMagneto-electric Induction, other weighty labours group themselves. His\r\ninvestigations on the Extra Current; on the Polar and other Condition of\r\nDiamagnetic Bodies; on Lines of Magnetic Force, their definite character\r\nand distribution; on the employment of the Induced Magneto-electric\r\nCurrent as a measure and test of Magnetic Action; on the Revulsive\r\nPhenomena of the magnetic field, are all, notwithstanding the diversity\r\nof title, researches in the domain of Magneto-electric Induction.\r\n\r\nFaraday's second group of researches and discoveries embrace the\r\nchemical phenomena of the current. The dominant result here is the great\r\nlaw of definite Electro-chemical Decomposition, around which are massed\r\nvarious researches on Electro-chemical Conduction and on Electrolysis\r\nboth with the Machine and with the Pile. To this group also belongs\r\nhis analysis of the Contact Theory, his inquiries as to the Source of\r\nVoltaic Electricity, and his final development of the Chemical Theory of\r\nthe pile.\r\n\r\nHis third great discovery is the Magnetization of Light, which I should\r\nliken to the Weisshorn among mountains--high, beautiful, and alone.\r\n\r\nThe dominant result of his fourth group of researches is the discovery\r\nof Diamagnetism, announced in his memoir as the Magnetic Condition of\r\nall Matter, round which are grouped his inquiries on the Magnetism\r\nof Flame and Gases; on Magne-crystallic action, and on Atmospheric\r\nMagnetism, in its relations to the annual and diurnal variation of the\r\nneedle, the full significance of which is still to be shown.\r\n\r\nThese are Faraday's most massive discoveries, and upon them his fame\r\nmust mainly rest. But even without them, sufficient would remain to\r\nsecure for him a high and lasting scientific reputation. We should\r\nstill have his researches on the Liquefaction of Gases; on Frictional\r\nElectricity; on the Electricity of the Gymnotus; on the source of\r\nPower in the Hydro-electric machine, the last two investigations being\r\nuntouched in the foregoing memoir; on Electro-magnetic Rotations; on\r\nRegelation; all his more purely Chemical Researches, including his\r\ndiscovery of Benzol. Besides these he published a multitude of minor\r\npapers, most of which, in some way or other, illustrate his genius. I\r\nhave made no allusion to his power and sweetness as a lecturer. Taking\r\nhim for all in all, I think it will be conceded that Michael Faraday\r\nwas the greatest experimental philosopher the world has ever seen; and\r\nI will add the opinion, that the progress of future research will tend,\r\nnot to dim or to diminish, but to enhance and glorify the labours of\r\nthis mighty investigator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16.\r\n\r\n    Illustrations of Character.\r\n\r\nThus far I have confined myself to topics mainly interesting to the man\r\nof science, endeavouring, however, to treat them in a manner unrepellent\r\nto the general reader who might wish to obtain a notion of Faraday as\r\na worker. On others will fall the duty of presenting to the world\r\na picture of the man. But I know you will permit me to add to the\r\nforegoing analysis a few personal reminiscences and remarks, tending to\r\nconnect Faraday with a wider world than that of science--namely, with\r\nthe general human heart.\r\n\r\nOne word in reference to his married life, in addition to what has been\r\nalready said, may find a place here. As in the former case, Faraday\r\nshall be his own spokesman. The following paragraph, though written in\r\nthe third person, is from his hand:--'On June 12, 1821, he married, an\r\nevent which more than any other contributed to his earthly happiness and\r\nhealthful state of mind. The union has continued for twenty-eight years\r\nand has in no wise changed, except in the depth and strength of its\r\ncharacter.'\r\n\r\nFaraday's immediate forefathers lived in a little place called Clapham\r\nWood Hall, in Yorkshire. Here dwelt Robert Faraday and Elizabeth his\r\nwife, who had ten children, one of them, James Faraday, born in 1761,\r\nbeing father to the philosopher. A family tradition exists that the\r\nFaradays came originally from Ireland. Faraday himself has more than\r\nonce expressed to me his belief that his blood was in part Celtic, but\r\nhow much of it was so, or when the infusion took place, he was unable to\r\nsay. He could imitate the Irish brogue, and his wonderful vivacity may\r\nhave been in part due to his extraction. But there were other qualities\r\nwhich we should hardly think of deriving from Ireland. The most\r\nprominent of these was his sense of order, which ran like a luminous\r\nbeam through all the transactions of his life. The most entangled and\r\ncomplicated matters fell into harmony in his hands. His mode of\r\nkeeping accounts excited the admiration of the managing board of this\r\nInstitution. And his science was similarly ordered. In his Experimental\r\nResearches, he numbered every paragraph, and welded their various parts\r\ntogether by incessant reference. His private notes of the Experimental\r\nResearches, which are happily preserved, are similarly numbered: their\r\nlast paragraph bears the figure 16,041. His working qualities, moreover,\r\nshowed the tenacity of the Teuton. His nature was impulsive, but there\r\nwas a force behind the impulse which did not permit it to retreat. If in\r\nhis warm moments he formed a resolution, in his cool ones he made that\r\nresolution good. Thus his fire was that of a solid combustible, not that\r\nof a gas, which blazes suddenly, and dies as suddenly away.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must claim your tolerance for the limits by which I am\r\nconfined. No materials for a life of Faraday are in my hands, and what\r\nI have now to say has arisen almost wholly out of our close personal\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nLetters of his, covering a period of sixteen years, are before me,\r\neach one of which contains some characteristic utterance;--strong, yet\r\ndelicate in counsel, joyful in encouragement, and warm in affection.\r\nReferences which would be pleasant to such of them as still live are\r\nmade to Humboldt, Biot, Dumas, Chevreul, Magnus, and Arago. Accident\r\nbrought these names prominently forward; but many others would be\r\nrequired to complete his list of continental friends. He prized the love\r\nand sympathy of men--prized it almost more than the renown which his\r\nscience brought him. Nearly a dozen years ago it fell to my lot to\r\nwrite a review of his 'Experimental Researches' for the 'Philosophical\r\nMagazine.' After he had read it, he took me by the hand, and said,\r\n'Tyndall, the sweetest reward of my work is the sympathy and good will\r\nwhich it has caused to flow in upon me from all quarters of the world.'\r\nAmong his letters I find little sparks of kindness, precious to no one\r\nbut myself, but more precious to me than all. He would peep into the\r\nlaboratory when he thought me weary, and take me upstairs with him to\r\nrest. And if I happened to be absent, he would leave a little note for\r\nme, couched in this or some other similar form:--'Dear Tyndall,--I was\r\nlooking for you, because we were at tea--we have not yet done--will you\r\ncome up?' I frequently shared his early dinner; almost always, in fact,\r\nwhile my lectures were going on. There was no trace of asceticism in his\r\nnature. He preferred the meat and wine of life to its locusts and wild\r\nhoney. Never once during an intimacy of fifteen years did he mention\r\nreligion to me, save when I drew him on to the subject. He then spoke\r\nto me without hesitation or reluctance; not with any apparent desire to\r\n'improve the occasion,' but to give me such information as I sought.\r\nHe believed the human heart to be swayed by a power to which science\r\nor logic opened no approach, and, right or wrong, this faith, held in\r\nperfect tolerance of the faiths of others, strengthened and beautified\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nFrom the letters just referred to, I will select three for publication\r\nhere. I choose the first, because it contains a passage revealing the\r\nfeelings with which Faraday regarded his vocation, and also because it\r\ncontains an allusion which will give pleasure to a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Royal Institution. [ this is crossed out by Faraday ]\r\n\r\n'Ventnor, Isle of Wight, June 28, 1854.\r\n\r\n'My Dear Tyndall,--You see by the top of this letter how much habit\r\nprevails over me; I have just read yours from thence, and yet I think\r\nmyself there. However, I have left its science in very good keeping, and\r\nI am glad to learn that you are at experiment once more. But how is the\r\nhealth? Not well, I fear. I wish you would get yourself strong first\r\nand work afterwards. As for the fruits, I am sure they will be good, for\r\nthough I sometimes despond as regards myself, I do not as regards you.\r\nYou are young, I am old.... But then our subjects are so glorious,\r\nthat to work at them rejoices and encourages the feeblest; delights and\r\nenchants the strongest.\r\n\r\n'I have not yet seen anything from Magnus. Thoughts of him always\r\ndelight me. We shall look at his black sulphur together. I heard from\r\nSchonbein the other day. He tells me that Liebig is full of ozone, i.e.,\r\nof allotropic oxygen.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye for the present.\r\n\r\n'Ever, my dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\n'Yours truly,\r\n\r\n'M. Faraday.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contemplation of Nature, and his own relation to her, produced in\r\nFaraday a kind of spiritual exaltation which makes itself manifest here.\r\nHis religious feeling and his philosophy could not be kept apart; there\r\nwas an habitual overflow of the one into the other.\r\n\r\nWhether he or another was its exponent, he appeared to take equal\r\ndelight in science. A good experiment would make him almost dance with\r\ndelight. In November, 1850, he wrote to me thus:--'I hope some day to\r\ntake up the point respecting the magnetism of associated particles.\r\nIn the meantime I rejoice at every addition to the facts and reasoning\r\nconnected with the subject. When science is a republic, then it gains:\r\nand though I am no republican in other matters, I am in that.' All his\r\nletters illustrate this catholicity of feeling. Ten years ago, when\r\ngoing down to Brighton, he carried with him a little paper I had just\r\ncompleted, and afterwards wrote to me. His letter is a mere sample of\r\nthe sympathy which he always showed to me and my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Brighton, December 9, 1857.\r\n\r\n'My Dear Tyndall,--I cannot resist the pleasure of saying how very much\r\nI have enjoyed your paper. Every part has given me delight. It goes on\r\nfrom point to point beautifully. You will find many pencil marks, for I\r\nmade them as I read. I let them stand, for though many of them receive\r\ntheir answer as the story proceeds, yet they show how the wording\r\nimpresses a mind fresh to the subject, and perhaps here and there you\r\nmay like to alter it slightly, if you wish the full idea, i.e., not an\r\ninaccurate one, to be suggested at first; and yet after all I believe\r\nit is not your exposition, but the natural jumping to a conclusion that\r\naffects or has affected my pencil.\r\n\r\n'We return on Friday, when I will return you the paper.\r\n\r\n'Ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n'M. Faraday.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third letter will come in its proper place towards the end.\r\n\r\nWhile once conversing with Faraday on science, in its relations to\r\ncommerce and litigation, he said to me, that at a certain period of his\r\ncareer, he was forced definitely to ask himself, and finally to decide\r\nwhether he should make wealth or science the pursuit of his life. He\r\ncould not serve both masters, and he was therefore compelled to choose\r\nbetween them. After the discovery of magneto-electricity his fame was\r\nso noised abroad, that the commercial world would hardly have considered\r\nany remuneration too high for the aid of abilities like his. Even before\r\nhe became so famous, he had done a little 'professional business.' This\r\nwas the phrase he applied to his purely commercial work. His friend,\r\nRichard Phillips, for example, had induced him to undertake a number of\r\nanalyses, which produced, in the year 1830, an addition to his income\r\nof more than a thousand pounds; and in 1831 a still greater addition. He\r\nhad only to will it to raise in 1832 his professional business income\r\nto 5000L. a year. Indeed double this sum would be a wholly insufficient\r\nestimate of what he might, with ease, have realised annually during the\r\nlast thirty years of his life.\r\n\r\nWhile restudying the Experimental Researches with reference to the\r\npresent memoir, the conversation with Faraday here alluded to came to\r\nmy recollection, and I sought to ascertain the period when the question,\r\n'wealth or science,' had presented itself with such emphasis to his\r\nmind. I fixed upon the year 1831 or 1832, for it seemed beyond the range\r\nof human power to pursue science as he had done during the subsequent\r\nyears, and to pursue commercial work at the same time. To test this\r\nconclusion I asked permission to see his accounts, and on my own\r\nresponsibility, I will state the result. In 1832, his professional\r\nbusiness income, instead of rising to 5000L., or more, fell from 1090L.\r\n4s. to 155L. 9s. From this it fell with slight oscillations to 92L. in\r\n1837, and to zero in 1838. Between 1839 and 1845, it never, except in\r\none instance, exceeded 22L.; being for the most part much under this.\r\nThe exceptional year referred to was that in which he and Sir Charles\r\nLyell were engaged by Government to write a report on the Haswell\r\nColliery explosion, and then his business income rose to 112L. From\r\nthe end of 1845 to the day of his death, Faraday's annual professional\r\nbusiness income was exactly zero. Taking the duration of his life into\r\naccount, this son of a blacksmith, and apprentice to a bookbinder,\r\nhad to decide between a fortune of 150,000L. on the one side, and his\r\nundowered science on the other. He chose the latter, and died a poor\r\nman. But his was the glory of holding aloft among the nations the\r\nscientific name of England for a period of forty years.\r\n\r\nThe outward and visible signs of fame were also of less account to him\r\nthan to most men. He had been loaded with scientific honours from all\r\nparts of the world. Without, I imagine, a dissentient voice, he was\r\nregarded as the prince of the physical investigators of the present age.\r\nThe highest scientific position in this country he had, however, never\r\nfilled. When the late excellent and lamented Lord Wrottesley resigned\r\nthe presidency of the Royal Society, a deputation from the council,\r\nconsisting of his Lordship, Mr. Grove, and Mr. Gassiot, waited upon\r\nFaraday, to urge him to accept the president's chair. All that argument\r\nor friendly persuasion could do was done to induce him to yield to the\r\nwishes of the council, which was also the unanimous wish of scientific\r\nmen. A knowledge of the quickness of his own nature had induced in\r\nFaraday the habit of requiring an interval of reflection, before he\r\ndecided upon any question of importance. In the present instance he\r\nfollowed his usual habit, and begged for a little time.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, I went up to his room and said on entering\r\nthat I had come to him with some anxiety of mind. He demanded its cause,\r\nand I responded:--'Lest you should have decided against the wishes of\r\nthe deputation that waited on you yesterday.' 'You would not urge me to\r\nundertake this responsibility,' he said. 'I not only urge you,' was my\r\nreply, 'but I consider it your bounden duty to accept it.' He spoke of\r\nthe labour that it would involve; urged that it was not in his nature to\r\ntake things easy; and that if he became president, he would surely have\r\nto stir many new questions, and agitate for some changes. I said that in\r\nsuch cases he would find himself supported by the youth and strength\r\nof the Royal Society. This, however, did not seem to satisfy him. Mrs.\r\nFaraday came into the room, and he appealed to her. Her decision was\r\nadverse, and I deprecated her decision. 'Tyndall,' he said at length, 'I\r\nmust remain plain Michael Faraday to the last; and let me now tell you,\r\nthat if I accepted the honour which the Royal Society desires to confer\r\nupon me, I would not answer for the integrity of my intellect for a\r\nsingle year.' I urged him no more, and Lord Wrottesley had a most worthy\r\nsuccessor in Sir Benjamin Brodie.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Duke of Northumberland, our Board of Managers\r\nwished to see Mr. Faraday finish his career as President of the\r\nInstitution, which he had entered on weekly wages more than half a\r\ncentury before. But he would have nothing to do with the presidency. He\r\nwished for rest, and the reverent affection of his friends was to him\r\ninfinitely more precious than all the honours of official life.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite of the intellectual life of Faraday was the\r\nindependence of his mind; and though prompt to urge obedience where\r\nobedience was due, with every right assertion of manhood he intensely\r\nsympathized. Even rashness on the side of honour found from him ready\r\nforgiveness, if not open applause. The wisdom of years, tempered by a\r\ncharacter of this kind, rendered his counsel peculiarly precious to\r\nmen sensitive like himself. I often sought that counsel, and, with\r\nyour permission, will illustrate its character by one or two typical\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, I was appointed examiner under the Council for Military\r\nEducation. At that time, as indeed now, I entertained strong convictions\r\nas to the enormous utility of physical science to officers of artillery\r\nand engineers, and whenever opportunity offered, I expressed this\r\nconviction without reserve. I did not think the recognition, though\r\nconsiderable, accorded to physical science in those examinations at\r\nall proportionate to its importance; and this probably rendered me more\r\njealous than I otherwise should have been of its claims.\r\n\r\nIn Trinity College, Dublin, a school had been organized with reference\r\nto the Woolwich examinations, and a large number of exceedingly\r\nwell-instructed young gentlemen were sent over from Dublin, to compete\r\nfor appointments in the artillery and the engineers. The result of\r\none examination was particularly satisfactory to me; indeed the marks\r\nobtained appeared so eloquent that I forbore saying a word about them.\r\nMy colleagues, however, followed the usual custom of sending in brief\r\nreports with their returns of marks. After the results were published,\r\na leading article appeared in 'The Times,' in which the reports were\r\nlargely quoted, praise being bestowed on all the candidates, except the\r\nexcellent young fellows who had passed through my hands.\r\n\r\nA letter from Trinity College drew my attention to this article,\r\nbitterly complaining that whereas the marks proved them to be the best\r\nof all, the science candidates were wholly ignored. I tried to set\r\nmatters right by publishing, on my own responsibility, a letter in\r\n'The Times.' The act, I knew, could not bear justification from the War\r\nOffice point of view; and I expected and risked the displeasure of my\r\nsuperiors. The merited reprimand promptly came. 'Highly as the Secretary\r\nof State for War might value the expression of Professor Tyndall's\r\nopinion, he begged to say that an examiner, appointed by His Royal\r\nHighness the Commander-in-Chief, had no right to appear in the public\r\npapers as Professor Tyndall has done, without the sanction of the War\r\nOffice.' Nothing could be more just than this reproof, but I did not\r\nlike to rest under it. I wrote a reply, and previous to sending it took\r\nit up to Faraday. We sat together before his fire, and he looked very\r\nearnest as he rubbed his hands and pondered. The following conversation\r\nthen passed between us:--\r\n\r\nF. You certainly have received a reprimand, Tyndall; but the matter is\r\nover, and if you wish to accept the reproof, you will hear no more about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nT. But I do not wish to accept it.\r\n\r\nF. Then you know what the consequence of sending that letter will be?\r\n\r\nT. I do.\r\n\r\nF. They will dismiss you.\r\n\r\nT. I know it.\r\n\r\nF. Then send the letter!\r\n\r\nThe letter was firm, but respectful; it acknowledged the justice of the\r\ncensure, but expressed neither repentance nor regret. Faraday, in\r\nhis gracious way, slightly altered a sentence or two to make it more\r\nrespectful still. It was duly sent, and on the following day I entered\r\nthe Institution with the conviction that my dismissal was there before\r\nme. Weeks, however, passed. At length the well-known envelope appeared,\r\nand I broke the seal, not doubting the contents. They were very\r\ndifferent from what I expected. 'The Secretary of State for War has\r\nreceived Professor Tyndall's letter, and deems the explanation therein\r\ngiven perfectly satisfactory.' I have often wished for an opportunity of\r\npublicly acknowledging this liberal treatment, proving, as it did, that\r\nLord Panmure could discern and make allowance for a good intention,\r\nthough it involved an offence against routine. For many years\r\nsubsequently it was my privilege to act under that excellent body, the\r\nCouncil for Military Education.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion of this kind, having encouraged me in a somewhat\r\nhardy resolution I had formed, Faraday backed his encouragement by an\r\nillustration drawn from his own life. The subject will interest you, and\r\nit is so sure to be talked about in the world, that no avoidable harm\r\ncan rise from its introduction here.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1835, Sir Robert Peel wished to offer Faraday a pension, but\r\nthat great statesman quitted office before he was able to realise his\r\nwish. The Minister who founded these pensions intended them, I believe,\r\nto be marks of honour which even proud men might accept without\r\ncompromise of independence. When, however, the intimation first\r\nreached Faraday in an unofficial way, he wrote a letter announcing his\r\ndetermination to decline the pension; and stating that he was quite\r\ncompetent to earn his livelihood himself. That letter still exists, but\r\nit was never sent, Faraday's repugnance having been overruled by\r\nhis friends. When Lord Melbourne came into office, he desired to see\r\nFaraday; and probably in utter ignorance of the man--for unhappily for\r\nthem and us, Ministers of State in England are only too often ignorant\r\nof great Englishmen--his Lordship said something that must have deeply\r\ndispleased his visitor. All the circumstances were once communicated to\r\nme, but I have forgotten the details. The term 'humbug,' I think, was\r\nincautiously employed by his Lordship, and other expressions were used\r\nof a similar kind. Faraday quitted the Minister with his own resolves,\r\nand that evening he left his card and a short and decisive note at the\r\nresidence of Lord Melbourne, stating that he had manifestly mistaken his\r\nLordship's intention of honouring science in his person, and declining\r\nto have anything whatever to do with the proposed pension. The\r\ngood-humoured nobleman at first considered the matter a capital joke;\r\nbut he was afterwards led to look at it more seriously. An excellent\r\nlady, who was a friend both to Faraday and the Minister, tried to\r\narrange matters between them; but she found Faraday very difficult to\r\nmove from the position he had assumed. After many fruitless efforts, she\r\nat length begged of him to state what he would require of Lord Melbourne\r\nto induce him to change his mind. He replied, 'I should require from his\r\nLordship what I have no right or reason to expect that he would grant--a\r\nwritten apology for the words he permitted himself to use to me.' The\r\nrequired apology came, frank and full, creditable, I thought, alike to\r\nthe Prime Minister and the philosopher.\r\n\r\nConsidering the enormous strain imposed on Faraday's intellect, the\r\nboy-like buoyancy even of his later years was astonishing. He was often\r\nprostrate, but he had immense resiliency, which he brought into action\r\nby getting away from London whenever his health failed. I have already\r\nindicated the thoughts which filled his mind during the evening of his\r\nlife. He brooded on magnetic media and lines of force; and the great\r\nobject of the last investigation he ever undertook was the decision of\r\nthe question whether magnetic force requires time for its propagation.\r\nHow he proposed to attack this subject we may never know. But he has\r\nleft some beautiful apparatus behind; delicate wheels and pinions,\r\nand associated mirrors, which were to have been employed in the\r\ninvestigation. The mere conception of such an inquiry is an illustration\r\nof his strength and hopefulness, and it is impossible to say to what\r\nresults it might have led him. But the work was too heavy for his tired\r\nbrain. It was long before he could bring himself to relinquish it and\r\nduring this struggle he often suffered from fatigue of mind. It was at\r\nthis period, and before he resigned himself to the repose which marked\r\nthe last two years of his life, that he wrote to me the following\r\nletter--one of many priceless letters now before me--which reveals, more\r\nthan anything another pen could express, the state of his mind at the\r\ntime. I was sometimes censured in his presence for my doings in the\r\nAlps, but his constant reply was, 'Let him alone, he knows how to take\r\ncare of himself.' In this letter, anxiety on this score reveals itself\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Hampton Court, August 1, 1864.\r\n\r\n'My Dear Tyndall,--I do not know whether my letter will catch you, but I\r\nwill risk it, though feeling very unfit to communicate with a man whose\r\nlife is as vivid and active as yours; but the receipt of your kind\r\nletter makes me to know that, though I forget, I am not forgotten, and\r\nthough I am not able to remember at the end of a line what was said at\r\nthe beginning of it, the imperfect marks will convey to you some sense\r\nof what I long to say. We had heard of your illness through Miss Moore,\r\nand I was therefore very glad to learn that you are now quite well;\r\ndo not run too many risks or make your happiness depend too much upon\r\ndangers, or the hunting of them. Sometimes the very thinking of you, and\r\nwhat you may be about, wearies me with fears, and then the cogitations\r\npause and change, but without giving me rest. I know that much of this\r\ndepends upon my own worn-out nature, and I do not know why I write\r\nit, save that when I write to you I cannot help thinking it, and the\r\nthoughts stand in the way of other matter.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n'See what a strange desultory epistle I am writing to you, and yet I\r\nfeel so weary that I long to leave my desk and go to the couch.\r\n\r\n'My dear wife and Jane desire their kindest remembrances: I hear them in\r\nthe next room:... I forget--but not you, my dear Tyndall, for I am\r\n\r\n'Ever yours,\r\n\r\n'M. Faraday.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThis weariness subsided when he relinquished his work, and I have a\r\ncheerful letter from him, written in the autumn of 1865. But towards\r\nthe close of that year he had an attack of illness, from which he never\r\ncompletely rallied. He continued to attend the Friday Evening Meetings,\r\nbut the advance of infirmity was apparent to us all. Complete rest\r\nbecame finally essential to him, and he ceased to appear among us. There\r\nwas no pain in his decline to trouble the memory of those who loved him.\r\nSlowly and peacefully he sank towards his final rest, and when it came,\r\nhis death was a falling asleep. In the fulness of his honours and of his\r\nage he quitted us; the good fight fought, the work of duty--shall I not\r\nsay of glory?--done. The 'Jane' referred to in the foregoing letter is\r\nFaraday's niece, Miss Jane Barnard, who with an affection raised almost\r\nto religious devotion watched him and tended him to the end.\r\n\r\nI saw Mr. Faraday for the first time on my return from Marburg in 1850.\r\nI came to the Royal Institution, and sent up my card, with a copy of the\r\npaper which Knoblauch and myself had just completed. He came down and\r\nconversed with me for half an hour. I could not fail to remark the\r\nwonderful play of intellect and kindly feeling exhibited by his\r\ncountenance. When he was in good health the question of his age would\r\nnever occur to you. In the light and laughter of his eyes you never\r\nthought of his grey hairs. He was then on the point of publishing one\r\nof his papers on Magnecrystallic action, and he had time to refer in\r\na flattering Note to the memoir I placed in his hands. I returned to\r\nGermany, worked there for nearly another year, and in June, 1851, came\r\nback finally from Berlin to England. Then, for the first time, and on my\r\nway to the meeting of the British Association, at Ipswich, I met a man\r\nwho has since made his mark upon the intellect of his time; who has long\r\nbeen, and who by the strong law of natural affinity must continue to\r\nbe, a brother to me. We were both without definite outlook at the time,\r\nneeding proper work, and only anxious to have it to perform. The chairs\r\nof Natural History and of Physics being advertised as vacant in the\r\nUniversity of Toronto, we applied for them, he for the one, I for the\r\nother; but, possibly guided by a prophetic instinct, the University\r\nauthorities declined having anything to do with either of us. If I\r\nremember aright, we were equally unlucky elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOne of Faraday's earliest letters to me had reference to this Toronto\r\nbusiness, which he thought it unwise in me to neglect. But Toronto had\r\nits own notions, and in 1853, at the instance of Dr. Bence Jones, and on\r\nthe recommendation of Faraday himself, a chair of Physics at the Royal\r\nInstitution was offered to me. I was tempted at the same time to go\r\nelsewhere, but a strong attraction drew me to his side. Let me say\r\nthat it was mainly his and other friendships, precious to me beyond all\r\nexpression, that caused me to value my position here more highly than\r\nany other that could be offered to me in this land. Nor is it for its\r\nhonour, though surely that is great, but for the strong personal ties\r\nthat bind me to it, that I now chiefly prize this place. You might not\r\ncredit me were I to tell you how lightly I value the honour of being\r\nFaraday's successor compared with the honour of having been Faraday's\r\nfriend. His friendship was energy and inspiration; his 'mantle' is a\r\nburden almost too heavy to be borne.\r\n\r\nSometimes during the last year of his life, by the permission or\r\ninvitation of Mrs. Faraday, I went up to his rooms to see him. The deep\r\nradiance, which in his time of strength flashed with such extraordinary\r\npower from his countenance, had subsided to a calm and kindly light, by\r\nwhich my latest memory of him is warmed and illuminated. I knelt one day\r\nbeside him on the carpet and placed my hand upon his knee; he stroked\r\nit affectionately, smiled, and murmured, in a low soft voice, the last\r\nwords that I remember as having been spoken to me by Michael Faraday.\r\n\r\nIt was my wish and aspiration to play the part of Schiller to this\r\nGoethe: and he was at times so strong and joyful--his body so active,\r\nand his intellect so clear--as to suggest to me the thought that\r\nhe, like Goethe, would see the younger man laid low. Destiny ruled\r\notherwise, and now he is but a memory to us all. Surely no memory could\r\nbe more beautiful. He was equally rich in mind and heart. The\r\nfairest traits of a character sketched by Paul, found in him perfect\r\nillustration. For he was 'blameless, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour,\r\napt to teach, not given to filthy lucre.' He had not a trace of worldly\r\nambition; he declared his duty to his Sovereign by going to the levee\r\nonce a year, but beyond this he never sought contact with the great.\r\nThe life of his spirit and of his intellect was so full, that the things\r\nwhich men most strive after were absolutely indifferent to him. 'Give me\r\nhealth and a day,' says the brave Emerson, 'and I will make the pomp of\r\nemperors ridiculous.' In an eminent degree Faraday could say the same.\r\nWhat to him was the splendour of a palace compared with a thunderstorm\r\nupon Brighton Downs?--what among all the appliances of royalty to\r\ncompare with the setting sun? I refer to a thunderstorm and a sunset,\r\nbecause these things excited a kind of ecstasy in his mind, and to\r\na mind open to such ecstasy the pomps and pleasures of the world are\r\nusually of small account. Nature, not education, rendered Faraday strong\r\nand refined. A favourite experiment of his own was representative of\r\nhimself. He loved to show that water in crystallizing excluded all\r\nforeign ingredients, however intimately they might be mixed with it. Out\r\nof acids, alkalis, or saline solutions, the crystal came sweet and pure.\r\nBy some such natural process in the formation of this man, beauty and\r\nnobleness coalesced, to the exclusion of everything vulgar and low. He\r\ndid not learn his gentleness in the world, for he withdrew himself from\r\nits culture; and still this land of England contained no truer gentleman\r\nthan he. Not half his greatness was incorporate in his science, for\r\nscience could not reveal the bravery and delicacy of his heart.\r\n\r\nBut it is time that I should end these weak words, and lay my poor\r\ngarland on the grave of this\r\n\r\n         Just and faithful knight of God.",
