R. Reinagle, Esq., R.A.\r\n\r\n Being the subject of a Discourse delivered at the Royal Institution\r\n of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an apposite discourse to introduce the subject, the first\r\ncourse taken, was to demonstrate the advantages of understanding the\r\nright use of geometrical terms in our descriptions of the varieties\r\nof shape, both in nature and art.\r\n\r\nEvery thing deserving the title of beautiful, and every grand object,\r\nassume an outline of definite character: these are to be found in the\r\ndifferent classes of geometrical figures; the former in undulating\r\nlines of elliptic curves, and grandeur in angular dispositions of\r\nfigure. All motion assumes a curved direction[1]. The primary and\r\nleading object of the discourse was to prove the fact of original\r\nbeauty: and that a curved line was beautiful in an abstract point\r\nof view, free from all associations. For this purpose there were\r\ndesigned many diagrams on large black painted boards. [p002]\r\n\r\nThe explanation commenced with six or more parallel lines at equal\r\ndistances, and equal length, in an horizontal position to the eye of\r\nthe audience, _Fig._ 1; and another set of the same number of lines\r\ndrawn perpendicular, _Fig._ 2: these were demonstrated to possess not\r\nthe slightest character or principle of beauty in them, either as\r\nseparate lines, or collectively, however many.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 1.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 2.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 3.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 4.]\r\n\r\nThe next diagram consisted of six or more radiating lines from\r\na centre, _Fig._ 3, and a corresponding number in an horizontal\r\ndirection, but of unequal quantities; they diminished like a flight\r\nof steps, _Fig._ 4. It was then shown that the first means of\r\ncombining the six or more lines, which had been first drawn, so as\r\nto please the eye, without creating any geometrical figure, was the\r\nradiating principle. Our eye not only can tolerate that union of\r\nlines, but receive the impression as pleasing in character; while all\r\nlines parallel to each other, being right [p003] lines, and viewed\r\nas a flight of steps, or pile of planks, opposite the observer, are\r\ndisagreeable. Upon the former principle it is, that the rays of the\r\nsun, and rays of light generally, are so attractive and beautiful.\r\nIt is from this circumstance that right lines drawn in an inclined\r\nposition to the plane of the picture, derive an interest from the\r\nangles engendered through the imagination.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 5.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 6.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 7.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 8.]\r\n\r\nTo follow up the principle by regular steps, and to open a clear\r\nview of the laws of beauty in lines, there were traced some inclined\r\nright lines (_Fig._ 5), with a regular set of right angles upon it,\r\nlike the stems of leaves on each side. This exhibited no sort of\r\nbeauty, nor any other advantage than mere combinations of formal\r\nangles. The next diagram (_Fig._ 6) was an inclined line as before,\r\nwith similar angular projecting stems, to which were added elliptic\r\ncurves on the upper side of each branch, that produced the form of a\r\nleaf. _Fig._ 7 was another inclined line, having oval curves upon it.\r\nBoth these were shown to possess principles approaching to beauty, by\r\nprogressive advances in combination and original structure. _Fig._ 8\r\nwas an inclined line with the oval curves upon it; to which a similar\r\naddition of elliptic curves were adjoined to the stems, [p004] as in\r\n_Fig._ 6. This addition made a new advance towards beauty. _Fig._\r\n9 commenced a more perfect principle of beauty, having an elliptic\r\nstem with oval branches rising from it, as in the others. If to this,\r\nthe principle of gradation had been given, the eye would prefer it;\r\nI mean, by a scale of increase from the top to the bottom of the\r\nprojecting stems: and if there had been superadded the external\r\ncontour of a lengthened egg, like the form of a sage leaf, we should,\r\nstep by step, advance into the region of beautiful character of\r\nexterior shape. _Fig._ 10 is a retrograde, showing how uncongenial\r\nangular forms are to curved lines, when producing ornament; at\r\nleast how little our eye can bear the angular projections from the\r\nelliptic or oval turned stem. _Fig._ 11 was a curve of exactly the\r\nsame disk, with the same oval stems, to which a small serpentine\r\naddition was made, expressing a leaf. Of all the last seven diagrams,\r\nthis abounded with the greatest portion of beautiful lines, and is\r\nindisputably the most agreeable and beautiful. Combinations are like\r\nnumericals; many of these forms, placed together with judgment and\r\ndiscretion, will attract us from the larger proportion of beauty\r\nthat meets the eye at once, like a head of beautiful hair: one hair,\r\nhowever gracefully bent, cannot impress us like an entire lock of\r\nthe hair; nor will this [p005] curl charm us as the whole will on\r\nthe human head. We owe to construction and combination all our\r\npleasurable feelings of beauty: no person is allured by a single\r\nfeature of any species of objects: but a thousand, or a million,\r\narouses our anxious notice. Thus, the last diagram of the elliptic\r\nstem and the foliage upon it, exhibited, by the continuity of curved\r\nlines, the greatest approach to beauty, of all the figures presented\r\nto the notice of the audience.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 9.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 10.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 11.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 12.]\r\n\r\nThese preliminary designs opened the way for richer combinations; but\r\nthe subject affording such an immense field of variety, I confined\r\nmyself to the narrowest limits, and to one oval disk of seven inches\r\ntransverse diameter, from which seven different designs were shown on\r\npaper. The first had a variety of serpentine lines placed at random,\r\nall produced by the disk of the oval just named, and the confluent\r\nlines of two such, placed side by side, or end to end, _Fig._ 12;\r\nwhich oval disk was put upon the lines to prove the construction.\r\nThese lines, without expressing or forming any sort of figure,\r\nexhibit a set of elegant curves, of varied quantities of convex and\r\nconcave, with which our eye will be more pleased than any set of\r\nright lines similarly distributed, as in _Fig._ 13, which follows.\r\n[p006]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 13.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 14.]\r\n\r\nTwo other diagrams were placed before the company, each a circle of\r\n12 ovals, from the same disk, revolved upon an axis, resting upon one\r\nend of the transverse diameter, (the length-ways of the oval,) which\r\nfigure in the skeleton was a duodecagon. _Fig._ 14 is one of the\r\ndiagrams; the ovals folding regularly over each other. By suppressing\r\nthe continuity of the oval disk, where the lines would traverse, a\r\nvery pleasing figure [p007] is created. It may be easily converted\r\ninto foliage, and can be amazingly varied in principle, by having\r\nfewer ovals, and making them revolve upon an arm or continuation of\r\na line from the transverse diameter. _Fig._ 15 is the same diagram,\r\nwith all the oval lines described, which forms a figure of elegant\r\nintricacy; each member, or curvilinear subdivision, assumes a most\r\nagreeable shape: the whole, at the first sight, does not carry the\r\nevidence of being generated from the same disk. These agreeable\r\nfigures may be varied to an extraordinary extent: the two that were\r\npresented were mere examples of some of the numerous changes that any\r\ngiven oval disk may create.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 15.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 16.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 17.]\r\n\r\nThe objects next presented, were three vases of very dissimilar\r\nappearance, all produced from the same diagram of the oval; each in\r\na separate drawing. The first was like a Greek vase with handles;\r\nits character established by employing certain proportions of\r\nquantities, in seven parts. The body has four parts, the foot or\r\npedestal one; the neck two. The handles were regulated in the\r\nposition and projection by lines drawn from the bottom of the vase,\r\nthrough the ovals which compose the outline of the two sides; and\r\npassing through the transverse diameter. These handles were made\r\nfrom an oval that was the length of half the line of the transverse\r\ndiameter, _Fig._ 16. The skeleton of angles that [p008] govern the\r\nshape of this vase, is a very pretty figure of itself. The form does\r\nnot proceed from any caprice of irregularity, but is consistent\r\nwith rational organization, and symmetrical proportions. The figure\r\nof the plate sufficiently describes the mode of making the diagram\r\nwithout entering into the detail. _Fig._ 17 represents a tazza with\r\nhandles: the same disk is apparent, by the dotted lines that made the\r\nfirst vase. The ovals [p009] are placed right and left of a central\r\nperpendicular line, dividing the cup in two parts; the transverse\r\ndiameters meet in one line parallel to the base of the tazza; a\r\ndotted outline expresses the angular position of the handles: the\r\nconcave lip of the tazza is made by the same oval disk, whose\r\ntransverse diameter leads to the under line of the folding edge of\r\nthe cup. The leg of the tazza is produced by the same small disk\r\nthat served for the handles of the first vase. The body of the vase\r\nand the leg form two equal parts; the whole upper extent ought to be\r\nseven parts, so that it is seven and two[2]; the width of the base\r\nof the leg measures two parts, and the altitude three, of the seven\r\nparts. These proportions cannot produce any other than agreeable\r\nappearances, apply them as we may.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 18.]\r\n\r\nThe third vase, exhibited an Hebe cup, with a handle, which presented\r\na totally different appearance in form to the two previous ones. It\r\nwas proportioned by similar principles: the larger disk made the\r\nbody, inclined right and left upon the end of the oval. The neck and\r\nthe leg were both made from the smaller oval disk; the dotted lines\r\nto the ovals of the leg sufficiently show the fact. The handle and\r\nconcave lip of the cup were made by an application of the same disk.\r\nThe altitude contained four parts. The body two parts, the leg one\r\npart, and the neck one other part; the handle rises one-eighth above:\r\nevery portion of this figure is created by the two disks previously\r\nnamed. The foliage rises from below and descends from above,\r\none-fourth of the whole height of the body [p010] to the commencement\r\nof the concavity of the neck, where the beading runs round.\r\n\r\nI remarked, that by adhering to regular proportional quantities of 1\r\nand 2, 3 and 5, 2 and 5, 7 and 5, 7 and 2, &c., and using elliptic\r\ndisks or curves, very great beauties are derived.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 19.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 20.]\r\n\r\nA skeleton of the tazza in angles was drawn on a black painted board,\r\ntogether with oval disks placed upon those lines, which clearly\r\ndemonstrated the whole system of the construction. The explanation\r\nof these various diagrams necessarily involved a circumstantial\r\ndescription of each created figure, which were thoroughly analysed.\r\nQuantity and variety were particularly dwelt upon, as absolutely\r\nnecessary to the production of perfect beauty; equalities being\r\nunfriendly to that symmetry which accords with nature. Some other\r\ndiagrams were drawn, to show the inelegant appearance of radiating\r\nlines from the concave or convex half of an oval or an ellipse,\r\n_Fig._ 19: but by drawing another convex half of an oval, and placing\r\nthose lines as tangents, greater beauty was formed by the alternate\r\nchanges and varieties of inclination of each tangent, _Fig._ 20. This\r\nwas capable of an immediate adaptation to elegant vegetation; [p011]\r\na few convex and concave elliptic curves added to each tangent,\r\nproduced an ear of barley, or an ear of rye, the elegant construction\r\nof which, is rarely noticed in our remarks on nature, _Fig._ 21.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 21.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion on these various designs being concluded, some\r\nimportant compositions of three great and renowned painters were\r\nproduced, to corroborate what had been advanced in support of the\r\nnative beauty of the oval and ellipse. Raphael’s grand composition of\r\nthe dispute on the Sacrament is in three grand oval curves.\r\n\r\nThe Doctors of the Church on the ground plan are ranged in an oval\r\nconvex line; and the heavenly Choirs engage two concave oval shapes\r\nof the same proportion, but of unequal quantities. This is also a\r\nproof of a composition of parts, bearing two to one.\r\n\r\nThe facility of expressing such a composition, by being geometrical,\r\nis extremely easy.\r\n\r\nThe second illustration was the Aurora, by Guido, of the Aldobrandini\r\npalace. This was pointed out to depend upon an oval curve, and\r\ncontinued curvilinear details: the striking beauty of this fine\r\ncomposition is owing to its great and simple elliptic curve, which\r\nincludes the whole group; the attendant hours have the principle of\r\nradiating to a centre of the oval: thus harmonizing and uniting forms\r\ncongenial both to principle and nature.\r\n\r\nThe third grand composition was by Rubens, the Coronation ceremony of\r\nMary de Medicis, one of the grand Luxemburg pictures.\r\n\r\nThis very fine composition is contained in an oval concave [p012]\r\ncurve, and the figures in several points radiate to a centre. Some\r\nof the group pass the great leading line, but only to the degree\r\nand with the licence that a genius can effect, which destroys the\r\ntoo great, and the too palpable construction of the composition.\r\nThe allegorical figures of Fame and Genius hovering over the royal\r\npersonage, establish a centre to the oval, which prevents a void that\r\nwould have been weak in the composition.\r\n\r\nThree designs were next produced from Etruscan vases, to carry\r\nthe evidence further, and to show the original source of the\r\ndemonstrations of beauty in Grecian art. One was a charioteer driving\r\na pair of magnificent horses of the highest spirit, _Fig._ 22. The\r\ncomposition is elliptic, and serpentine within.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 22.]\r\n\r\nThe youthful conductor of the steeds is in a crescent or boat-shaped\r\ncar, and his form is elegantly bent to meet the action and motion;\r\nhis mantle flows behind in curved and serpentine folds, expressing\r\nthe wind occasioned by the velocity of action. A more graceful or\r\nbeautiful group and composition cannot be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe next design was a female in an elegant and very gentle serpentine\r\naction of the figure. Every portion of the outlines was elegant,\r\nfrom the varied succession of convexity and concavity; not a single\r\nangle could be traced throughout the whole [p013] of this beautiful\r\ncreature. She held in her left arm a very handsome oval vase; and in\r\nthe other a sort of scarf with ribands, all serpentine in form. By\r\nher side is placed a young man selected from another Etruscan design.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 23.]\r\n\r\nThe line of this figure was the outline of an ellipse; it is\r\nperfection in every respect; and the grace was shown to depend upon\r\ngentle curved lines of convex and concave, alternately blended, and\r\nconfluent. The motion of ships at sea is described in gentle elliptic\r\ncurves; the wings and plumage of birds assume the oval and elliptic\r\ncurves; all the fibres of their feathers have that form; some\r\nflattened, others more rounded: the pine-apple and numberless fruits\r\nhave all an oval character of outline.\r\n\r\nMany take the character of eggs, pointed at one end, and large and\r\nblunt at the other extremity. The leaves of trees [p014] have the\r\noval shape more than any other; the bend of the branches, and the\r\nwhole external form of many trees is oval.\r\n\r\nThere is no form of created things which may not be found to\r\ncorrespond in all its dependent shapes to ovals and ellipses of\r\nvarious disks, even objects which at first sight seem to contradict\r\nthe possibility of meeting this system.\r\n\r\nThe lecture was closed by some extracts and quotations from Lomazzo,\r\nDryden, Hogarth, Du Fresnoy, and the Abbé du Bos; the tendency\r\nof which was to show that lines had been mentioned, and had been\r\nwritten upon without any explanation given that could lead to certain\r\nconclusions. That all these authors attributed to supreme genius\r\nalone, and something of the divinely inspired character in artists,\r\nthe power to produce those indescribable lines that affect the human\r\neye so strongly. These lines I described as belonging to the oval and\r\nthe ellipsis, and the confluent lines by conjunction and combination;\r\nthat these indescribable lines, which from Plato to Dryden had never\r\nbeen detected or obtained a name; that puzzled all equally alike, are\r\nthose alone I attempted, and I believe proved in this lecture, to be\r\nthe elliptic combinations.\r\n\r\nI stated that the great Greek artists confined themselves to certain\r\nrules and principles of unerring consequences in the production\r\nof beauty, grace, or grandeur in their figures; that all their\r\ncompositions depended upon the same species of rule and order. I\r\npointed out, that fashion is in all countries the destroyer of\r\ntaste, that it unfits the mind for fixed principles; that where it\r\ndominates, _there_ taste will be always fluttering and never settle,\r\nnor have a sure dominion. The Greeks, having no such vile tormentor\r\nto divert them from a pure course in their progress, arrived at the\r\nsummit of perfection in every scientific pursuit, by following sure\r\nprinciples as their guides, and by never abandoning a path traced by\r\nnature, and matured by the most sublime philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [1] A great number of geometrical diagrams were exhibited, from a\r\n single line, to angles, squares, oblongs, circles, ovals, cones,\r\n cylinders, spiral lines, and various serpentine lines, &c.\r\n\r\n [2] The whole extent of the tazza, including the projection of the\r\n handles, should be seven parts; and the height of the vase two of\r\n such seven parts.\r\n\r\n[p015]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _On the Art of forming Diamonds into single Lenses for\r\n Microscopes_.—By Mr. A. Pritchard.\r\n\r\n [Communicated by Dr. GORING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the various improvements in Microscopes originated by Dr. Goring,\r\nthat which he conceives to be the most important is the construction\r\nof single magnifiers from adamant. The details relative to this novel\r\nclass of instruments, I have been induced to lay before the public.\r\nSingle microscopes naturally aplanatic, or at least sufficiently so\r\nfor practical purposes, possess an incontestable superiority over\r\nall others, and must be recognised by the scientific as verging\r\ntowards the ultimatum of improvement in magnifying glasses. The\r\nadvantages obtained by the most improved compound engiscopes over\r\nsingle microscopes resolve themselves into _the attainment of vision\r\nwithout aberration with considerable angles of aperture_; but against\r\nthis must be set the never-to-be-forgotten fact, that they only show\r\nus a _picture of an object instead of nature itself_; now a Diamond\r\nLens shows us our real object without any sensible aberration like\r\nthat produced by glass lenses; and we are entitled, I think, to\r\nexpect new discoveries in miscrosopic science, even at this late\r\nperiod, _from very deep single lenses of adamant_[3]. I shall not\r\nfatigue my [p016] readers by describing the difficulties which were\r\nencountered in the prosecution of the design of making diamond\r\nlenses. Nature does not seem to permit us to produce any thing of\r\nsurpassing excellence without proportional effort, and I shall simply\r\nsay, that in its infancy the project of grinding and polishing the\r\nrefractory substance of Adamant was far more hopeless than that of\r\nmaking achromatic glass lenses of 0.2 of an inch focus. I conceive it\r\njust to state that Messrs. Rundell and Bridge, of Ludgate-hill, had,\r\nat the time of the commencement of my labours, many Dutch diamond\r\ncutters at work, and that the foreman, Mr. Levi, with all his men,\r\nassured me, that it was impossible to work diamonds into spherical\r\ncurves; the same opinion was also expressed by several others who\r\nwere considered of standard authority in such matters.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this discouragement, in the summer of the year 1824,\r\nI was instigated by Dr. Goring (at his expense) to undertake the\r\ntask of working a diamond lens: (being then under the tuition of Mr.\r\nC. Varley, who was however at that time absent.) For this purpose,\r\nDr. G. forwarded to me a brilliant diamond, which, contrary to the\r\nexpectation of many, was at length ground into a spherical [p017]\r\nfigure, and examined by Mr. Levi, who expressed great astonishment\r\nat it, and added that he was not acquainted with any means by which\r\nthat figure could have been effected: unfortunately this stone was\r\nirrecoverably lost. Mr. Varley having returned from the country,\r\nbecoming now thoroughly heated with the project, permitted me to\r\ncomplete another diamond, which had been presented to me by Dr. G.:\r\nthis is a plano-convex of about the 1/20th of an inch focus: it was\r\nnot thought advisable to polish it more than sufficed to enable us\r\nto see objects through it, because several flaws, before invisible,\r\nmade their appearance in the process of polishing. In spite of all\r\nits imperfections, it plainly convinced us of the superiority which\r\na _perfect diamond lens_ would possess by its style of performance,\r\nboth as a single magnifier and as the object lens of a compound\r\nmicroscope. After the completion of my articles with Mr. V., being\r\nentirely under my own command, I devoted some time to the formation\r\nof a perfect diamond lens, and have at length succeeded in completing\r\na double convex of equal radii of about 1/25th of an inch focus,\r\nbearing an aperture of 1/30th of an inch with distinctness on opaque\r\nobjects, and its entire diameter on transparent ones; it was finished\r\nat the conclusion of last year. The date of its final completion\r\nhas by many been considered a remarkable epoch in the history of\r\nthe microscope, being the first perfect one ever _made_ or thought\r\nof in any part of the world[4]. I think it sufficient to say of\r\nthis adamantine lens that it gives vision with a trifling chromatic\r\naberration, but in other respects exceedingly like that of Dr. G.’s\r\nAmician reflector, but without its darkness: for it is quite evident\r\nthat its light must be superior to that of any compound microscope\r\nwhatever, acting with the same power and the same angle of aperture.\r\nThe advantage of seeing an object _without aberration_ by [p018]\r\nthe interposition of but a single magnifier, instead of looking at\r\na picture of it (however perfect) with an eye-glass, must surely be\r\nduly appreciated by every person endowed with ordinary reason. It\r\nrequires little knowledge of optics to be convinced that the simple\r\nunadulterated view of an object must enable us to look farther into\r\nits real texture, than we can see by any artificial arrangement\r\nwhatever; it is like seeing an action performed instead of a scenic\r\nrepresentation of it, or being informed of its occurrence by the most\r\nindisputable and accurate testimony.\r\n\r\nPrevious to grinding a diamond into a spherical figure, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that it should be ground flat, and parallel\r\non both sides (if not a Laske or plate diamond), so that we may be\r\nenabled to see through it, and try it as opticians try a piece of\r\nflint glass: without this preparatory step, it will be extremely\r\ndangerous to commence the process of grinding, for many diamonds\r\ngive a double, or even a species of triple refraction, forming\r\ntwo or three images of an object; this polarization of the light,\r\narising from the primitive form of the crystal, of course totally\r\nunfits them for making lenses[5]. I need not observe, that it must\r\nbe chosen of the finest water, and free from all visible flaws when\r\nexamined by a deep magnifier. It was extremely fortunate for diamond\r\nlenses that the first made was free from the defect of double vision,\r\notherwise diamonds _en masse_ might at once have been abandoned as\r\nunfit for optical purposes. The cause why some stones give single\r\nvision, and others several peculiar refractions, may also arise\r\nfrom different degrees of density or hardness occurring in the same\r\nstone. Diamond-cutters are in the habit of designating stones male\r\nand female, sometimes a _he_ and _she_ (as they have it) are united\r\nin the same gem,—their _he_ means merely a hard stone, and their\r\n_she_ a soft one. When a diamond which will give several refractions\r\nis ground into a spherical figure and partially polished, it is seen\r\nby the microscope to exhibit a [p019] peculiar appearance of an\r\naggregation of minute shivery cristallized flaws, sometimes radiated\r\nand sometimes in one direction, which can never be polished out:\r\nI believe I could disstinguish with certainty a bad lens from a\r\ngood one by this phenomenon without looking through it[6]. Precious\r\nstones, from their crystalized texture, are liable to the same\r\ndefects for optical purposes as diamonds.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the goodness of a stone it must next be prepared\r\nfor grinding; it will in many cases be advisable to make diamond\r\nlenses plano-convex, both because this figure gives a very low\r\naberration, and because it saves the trouble of grinding one side\r\nof the stone. It must never be forgotten, that it may be possible\r\nto neutralize the naturally low spherical aberration of a diamond\r\nlens by giving it an improper figure, or by the injudicious position\r\nof its sides in relation to the radiant. When the lens is to be\r\nplano-convex, cause the flat side to be polished as truly plane as\r\npossible, without ribs or scratches; for this purpose the diamond\r\nshould be so set as to possess the capability of being turned round,\r\nthat the proper direction with respect to the laminæ may be obtained:\r\nwhen the flat side is completed, let the other side be worked against\r\nanother diamond, so as to be brought into a spherical figure by the\r\nabrasion of its surface. When this is accomplished, a concave tool of\r\ncast iron must be formed of the required curve in a lathe, having a\r\nsmall mandril of about 2/10ths of an inch in diameter, and a velocity\r\nof about 60 revolutions per second! The diamond must now be fixed\r\nby a strong hard cement (made of equal parts of the best shell lac\r\nand pumice-stone powder, carefully melted together without burning)\r\nto a short handle, and held by the fingers against the concave tool\r\nwhile revolving. This tool must be paved by diamond powder, hammered\r\ninto it by an hardened steel convex punch: when the lens is uniformly\r\nground all over, very fine sifted diamond-dust carefully washed in\r\noil must be applied to another iron concave tool (I may here remark,\r\nthat of all the metals which I have used for this purpose soft cast\r\niron is decidedly to be preferred): this tool must [p020] be supplied\r\nwith the finest washed powder till the lens is completely polished.\r\nDuring the process of grinding, the stone should be examined by a\r\nmagnifying lens, to ascertain whether the figure is truly spherical;\r\nfor it sometimes will occur that the edges are ground quicker than\r\nthe centre, and hence it will assume the form of a colloid, and thus\r\nbe rendered unfit for microscopic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe spherical aberration of a diamond lens is extremely small, and\r\nwhen compared with that of a glass lens the difference is rendered\r\nstrikingly apparent. This diminution of error in the diamond arises\r\nfrom the enormous refractive power possessed by this brilliant\r\nsubstance, and the consequent increase of amplification, with _very\r\nshallow curves_. The longitudinal aberration of a plano-convex\r\ndiamond lens is only 0.955; while that of a glass one of the same\r\nfigure is 1.166; both numbers being enumerated in terms of their\r\nthickness, and their convex surfaces exposed to parallel rays. But\r\nthe indistinctness produced by lenses, arises chiefly from every\r\nmathematical point on the surface of an object being spread out into\r\na small circle; these circles, intermixing with each other, occasion\r\na confused view of the object. Now this error must necessarily\r\nbe in the ratio of the areas of these small circles, which being\r\nrespectively as the squares of their diameters, the lateral error\r\nproduced by a diamond lens will be 0.912; while that of a glass lens\r\nof like curvature is 2.775; but the magnifying power of the diamond\r\nlens will be to that of the glass as 8 to 3, their curves being\r\nsimilar; (or, in other words, the superficial amplification of an\r\nobject; with the perfect diamond lens before mentioned, is 22500\r\ntimes, while a similar magnifier, made of glass, amplifies only 3136\r\ntimes, reckoning 6 inches as the standard of distinct vision:) thus\r\nthe diamond will enable us to gain more power than it is possible to\r\nprocure by lenses of glass, for the focal distance of the smallest\r\nglass lens which can be well made is about the 1/80th of an inch,\r\nwhile that of a diamond, worked in the same tools, would be only the\r\n1/200th of an inch.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to compare the aberrations of the two lenses when of equal\r\npower, the curvature of the glass must be increased; and as it is\r\nwell known the lateral aberration increases inversely as the square\r\nof the radius, (the aperture and position remaining [p021] the same,)\r\nthe aberration of the diamond lens will only be about 1/20th of that\r\nproduced by the glass one, even when their thickness is the same; but\r\nas the curvature of the diamond is less, the thickness may be greatly\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nThe chromatic dispersion of the adamant being nearly as low as that\r\nof water, its effects in small lenses can barely be appreciated by\r\nthe eye, even in the examination of that valuable class of test\r\nobjects, which require enormous angles of aperture to be rendered\r\nvisible, which it is evident must be of easier attainment by diamond\r\nmagnifiers than by any other sort of microscope.\r\n\r\nA mathematical investigation of the spherical aberration of the\r\ndiamond when formed into lenses, I hope to lay before the public at\r\na future opportunity. The comparative numbers here taken from the\r\nlongitudinal aberration are, I believe, sufficiently accurate for\r\npractical purposes.\r\n\r\n _18, Picket-Street, Strand_.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [3] It seems generally admitted that, within a certain range of\r\n power not exceeding that of a lens of 1/20th of an inch focus,\r\n the beauty and truth of the vision given by the new compound\r\n microscopes cannot be equalled by that of any single instrument,\r\n at least of glass. It is no less true, however, that the _picture_\r\n of the compounds, however perfect, is not like a real object, will\r\n not admit of amplification beyond a certain point with advantage.\r\n Under the action of very deep eye-glasses, the image of opaque\r\n objects especially, first loses its strong, well-determined\r\n outline—then grows soft and nebulous, and finally melts away in\r\n shadowy confusion. Let the experiment be made of raising the power\r\n of a compound up to that of a 1/60th inch lens—then try it against\r\n the single microscope of that power (having, of course, the utmost\r\n opening the nature of the object viewed will permit). The observer,\r\n if open to conviction, will soon be taught the superior efficacy\r\n of the latter—for it will show the lines on the dust of Menelaus\r\n with such force and vivacity, that they will always be apparent\r\n _without any particular management of the light—nor can their image\r\n be extinguished by causing the illumination to be directed truly\r\n through the axis of the lens (as it always may in the compounds)_.\r\n A due consideration of the teeth and inequalities on the surface\r\n of a human hair, together with the _transverse connecting fibres\r\n between the lines on the scales of the curculio imperialis_, viewed\r\n as opaque objects, will suffice to complete the illustration of\r\n the subject; though the last object is not to be well seen by that\r\n kind of light which is given by silver cups—and a single lens of\r\n 1/60th inch focus can of course have no other. The effectiveness and\r\n penetrating faculties of simple magnifiers are invariably increased\r\n by an accession of power however great—that of compounds seems to\r\n be deteriorated beyond certain limits. An opinion may be hazarded\r\n that the achromatics and reflectors yet made _do not really surpass\r\n the efficacy of equivalent single lenses, even of glass, when\r\n their power exceeds that of a_ 1/20th lens, from 1/20th to 1/40th\r\n the vision may be about equal—but from 1/40th upwards infinitely\r\n inferior.\r\n\r\n The superior light of the single refraction can need no comment—and\r\n it is evident that there must be a degree of power at which that\r\n of the compounds will become too dim and feeble for vision,—while\r\n that of the single instrument will still retain a due intensity.\r\n For these reasons it is conceived that the close and penetrating\r\n scrutiny of lenses of diamond of perhaps only the 1/200th inch\r\n focus, and an equal aperture (which their very low aberration would\r\n easily admit of,) must enable us to see further into the arcana of\r\n nature than we have yet been empowered to do. Glass globules of\r\n 1/200th inch focus and indeed much deeper have been executed; but\r\n the testimony of _lenses_ of diamond would certainly be far more\r\n respectable, and is at least worthy of trial and examination.—C.R.G.\r\n\r\n [4] In Dr. Brewster’s treatise on new Philosophical instruments,\r\n Book 5, chap. 2, Page 403—Account of a new compound Microscope for\r\n objects of Natural History—is the following passage: “We cannot\r\n therefore expect any essential improvement in the single microscope,\r\n unless from the discovery of some transparent substance, which like\r\n the diamond combines a high refractive with a low dispersive power.”\r\n From which it seems certain that the Doctor never contemplated the\r\n possibility of working upon the substance of the diamond, though he\r\n must have been aware of its valuable properties.\r\n\r\n [5] There are fourteen different crystalline forms of the diamond,\r\n and of this number, from the laws which govern the polarization of\r\n light, the octohedron and truncated cube are probably the only ones\r\n that will give single vision. It is unfortunately very difficult\r\n to procure rough diamonds in this country, so we are compelled to\r\n use stones already cut, and to subject them to trial in the way\r\n mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\n [6] As many amateurs of science might take an interest in the\r\n inspection of the peculiar effect these lenses have on transmitted\r\n _light_, I shall be happy to exhibit them, as also the perfect lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Analysis of a newly-discovered Spring, at Stanley, near\r\n Wakefield_.—By Mr. William West.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineral springs, dependent for their characteristic properties on\r\ncarbonate of soda, appear to have been little noticed by chemists,\r\nand to have been still less attended to as curative means; at least\r\nin proportion to the multitude of cases in which that substance is\r\nadministered in various other forms. Indeed the inference to be\r\ndrawn from the silence respecting the modes of analysis adapted to\r\nsuch waters in our best elementary treatises, is that they have\r\nhitherto been very seldom met with. In one district, however, of\r\nYorkshire, carbonate of soda is of frequent occurrence; it is found\r\nin the ordinary springs; often, at the same time with substances\r\nwith which, in artificial solutions, or when concentrated, it, would\r\nbe considered wholly incompatible; while at other times it is the\r\npredominant, or the only remarkable saline constituent. An analysis\r\nof a water of this kind, known by the name of the Holbeck Spa, has\r\nlately been published in the Annals of Philosophy, by my friend E.\r\nS. George; similar springs are found, I understand, as far [p022]\r\nwestward as Bradford; they are numerous from the borings in and near\r\nHolbeck; while eight miles south, a water similar in its character,\r\nbut differing in containing about twice as much alkali in the same\r\nmeasure, has been discovered at Stanley.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles from Wakefield, near the Aberford or York road, is\r\nan ancient mansion called Hatfield Hall; near the park or inclosure\r\nof which, in boring for coal, the spring in question suddenly gushed\r\nup, when the workmen had got to the depth of eighty yards, and has\r\ncontinued to run spontaneously, in all seasons, at the rate of six\r\ngallons per minute.\r\n\r\nThe water at the spring is limpid and very sparkling; the portion\r\nwhich is allowed to escape, deposits upon the trough and in the\r\nchannel through which it runs a quantity of sulphur; the smell is\r\nthat of sulphuretted hydrogen; the taste, from the stimulus of the\r\nbubbles of gas modifying the softness of the alkali, rather pleasant\r\nthan otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe appearances presented by re-agents are,—\r\n\r\nWith tincture of soap, a slight opalescence.\r\n\r\nNitrate of silver, an abundant precipitate, partially re-dissolved by\r\npure nitric acid.\r\n\r\nSulphate of silver, a precipitate only partially soluble in nitric or\r\nacetic acid.\r\n\r\nMuriate of barytes, a slight precipitate.\r\n\r\nLime-water, a precipitate soluble with effervescence in acetic acid.\r\n\r\nOxalate of ammonia, no precipitate.\r\n\r\nOn boiling, a slight pellicle appeared, soluble in nitric acid.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of ammonia, no precipitate, nor any on the subsequent\r\naddition of phosphate of soda.\r\n\r\nThe water restored the colour of litmus paper slightly reddened.\r\n\r\nWith tincture of galls and ferrocyanate of potash, no change.\r\n\r\nWith muriate of lime, the water remained unchanged until heated; but\r\nwhen boiled, a copious precipitate took place.\r\n\r\nWhen concentrated by boiling, the water reddened turmeric paper, and\r\neffervesced strongly on the addition of an acid.\r\n\r\nNitromuriate of platina produced no precipitate, however concentrated\r\nthe water might be. [p023]\r\n\r\nThe results of the previous experiments indicate the presence of\r\n\r\n Soda,               Lime in small proportion,\r\n Muriatic acid,      No magnesia,\r\n Sulphuric acid,     No iron,\r\n Carbonic acid,      No potash.\r\n\r\nA. To ascertain the proportion of sulphuric acid, sixteen ounces\r\nby measure, previously saturated by acetic acid, were treated with\r\nmuriate of barytes; the precipitate, washed and dried, weighed\r\none grain; this indicates, in the imperial gallon, 3.2 grains of\r\nsulphuric acid, equivalent to 5.8 sulphate of soda, dry, or 13 grains\r\ncrystallized.\r\n\r\nB. For the muriatic acid; nitrate of silver, added to sixteen ounces\r\nof the water boiled, and the alkali previously saturated, gave a\r\nprecipitate weighing 2.8 grains; reduced to the proportion in the\r\nimperial gallon, this amounts to 26.9 grains chloride of silver,\r\nequivalent to 11 grains chloride of sodium (muriate of soda.)\r\n\r\nC. The crystalline pellicle separated from a pint of sixteen ounces,\r\non boiling, weighed 0.2 grains.\r\n\r\nThis was carbonate of lime; but in the water the lime would be\r\ncombined with muriatic acid, forming 0.22; or, in the imperial\r\ngallon, 2.1 dry chloride, or 3.75 crystallized muriate of lime.\r\n\r\nD. The precipitate formed on boiling with muriate of lime, weighed\r\nfrom the pint, 3.6 grains; from the imperial gallon, 34.6 grains;\r\nshowing the water to contain in that quantity a carbonated alkali\r\nequivalent to 53 grains of dry, or 59.5 crystallized bi-carbonate of\r\nsoda.\r\n\r\nE. Muriate of barytes, added to the water left on evaporating sixteen\r\nounces to two, gave a precipitate weighing 8.2 grains; deducting one\r\ngrain for sulphate of barytes, as found in experiment A, we have 7.2\r\ncarbonate of barytes; this indicates in the gallon 53 grains of dry,\r\nand 59.5 of crystallized carbonate of soda, as in the last experiment.\r\n\r\nLastly, a pint of sixteen ounces of the water, evaporated to dryness,\r\nfurnished in three trials of saline residuum, weighed after short\r\nexposure to a dull red heat, six grains, or 57.6 from [p024] the\r\nimperial gallon. Now we have seen that this would consist of\r\n\r\n  5.8      Dry sulphate of soda   (exp. A).\r\n 11.           Chloride of sodium ( —  B).\r\n  1.9          Carbonate of lime  ( —  C).\r\n ----\r\n 18.7\r\n 38.9\r\n ----\r\n 57.6\r\n\r\nThe remainder, 38.9, having been converted by the heat into\r\nproto-carbonate of soda, is equivalent to 54.5 dry, 61 grains\r\ncrystallized bi-carbonate, agreeing nearly with the quantities found\r\nfrom experiments D and E.\r\n\r\nFollowing, as I do, that doctrine which supposes the bases to be\r\ndistributed among the acids in a mineral water in the combinations\r\nwhich possess the greatest solubility, we must suppose the lime to be\r\nin the state of muriate; we shall then have to diminish the muriate,\r\nand increase the carbonate of soda: so that on this view, the saline\r\nconstituents of an imperial gallon, in the state in which they exist\r\nin the water, are,—\r\n\r\nSoda in combination with carbonic acid, equivalent to\r\n\r\n Bi-carbonate or super-carbonate  56 gr. dry.  62.5 crystallized\r\n of soda\r\n\r\n Sulphate of soda                  5.8  ditto  13     ditto\r\n\r\n Muriate of soda (chloride         8.75 ditto   8.75  ditto\r\n of sodium)\r\n\r\n Muriate of lime                   2.1  ditto   3.75  ditto\r\n\r\nThe gaseous contents of the water consist of variable proportions\r\nof carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and carburetted hydrogen;\r\nthe latter gas is continually emitted from the spring, in greater\r\nquantity than the water can absorb; and a portion of the other two\r\nalso escapes from its surface. I have made many experiments on\r\nthe gas, separated by boiling; but find the results, as I might\r\nanticipate, altogether inconclusive and uncertain. In waters\r\ncontaining, as at Harrogate, these gases with muriates or sulphates,\r\nboiling may be expected almost wholly to disengage them; but in this\r\ncase the affinity of the soda in dilute solution, is likely to retain\r\nthe carbonic [p025] acid, and even to cause a decomposition of the\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, so as to prevent our obtaining, in a gaseous\r\nform, the quantity really existing in the water, and imparting to it\r\nsensible or medicinal properties.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of medicinal qualities I am at all times cautious of\r\ngiving an opinion: but I may observe, first, that as this spring is\r\ndissimilar to any of those which have already attained celebrity, so\r\nnone of them can form a substitute for this; it is not Harrogate,\r\nor Cheltenham, or Buxton, or Tunbridge water: the alkaline springs\r\nof the West Riding, of which this is by far the strongest, stand\r\nas medicinal waters hitherto alone; the active ingredient, the\r\nbi-carbonate of soda, being spoken of in chemical works, as “rarely\r\nfound in mineral waters.”\r\n\r\nSecondly, from the known properties of this substance, carbonate\r\nof soda, and the frequency of its administration in a long train\r\nof arthritic, calculous and dyspeptic complaints, the water must\r\nbe highly useful as an anti-acid and as a diuretic; and as the\r\nadvantages which native mineral waters possess over artificial\r\nsolutions of the substances, in the great degree of dilution, and\r\nthe impregnation with gases, and still more in the adjuncts of\r\nleisure, exercise, pure air, regulated diet and early rising, are of\r\nespecial consequence in the latter very numerous class of diseases,\r\nthose called stomach and nervous complaints; we may fairly suppose\r\nthat such a spring will be found to be a valuable addition to those\r\npreviously known, applying, as it does, to cases of such frequent\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Observations on the State of Naval Construction in this Country_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears that there is at present a tendency to improvement in\r\nevery branch of science; monopoly in intellect may now be said\r\nto be vanishing; and empiricism is obliged to seek dark corners,\r\nto escape the light which is penetrating into regions from which\r\nit had but very lately been excluded. The administration, too,\r\nencourages advance of knowledge; yet notwithstanding these favourable\r\ncircumstances, there still exists, in [p026] some minds, an\r\ninaptitude of scientific perception, which induces unwillingness to\r\nacknowledge the advantage that results from the application of the\r\nexact sciences to the useful arts.\r\n\r\nThis neglect of scientific principles is nowhere more manifest than\r\nin the affairs of naval architecture, and it is not confined to the\r\nRoyal Navy, but extends also to our mercantile shipping; and hence\r\nit is that our commercial marine is in some respects behind foreign\r\nnations, especially the Americans, in the formation of its ships:\r\nour merchantmen are, almost without exception, the most unsafe[7]\r\nand slowest ships in the world. The ship-owners, therefore, would do\r\nwell to consider this circumstance, and endeavour to devise means of\r\nintroducing science into the merchant yards. The establishment of the\r\nnew university in the metropolis affords an opportunity of doing it\r\nat a comparatively small expense, by the foundation of Lectures on\r\nthe theory of Naval Architecture; and the support even of a separate\r\ninstitution in the vicinity of the merchant yards of this great port,\r\nfor the education of ship surveyors, would soon be repaid by the\r\nimproved character of our merchant shipping.\r\n\r\nIf the science of Naval Architecture depend on certain\r\nphysico-mathematical laws, as no doubt it does, it is monstrous to\r\nimagine for a moment that such laws can be developed by a flight of\r\nfancy, or that a man is born with an _intuitive optical_ perception\r\nof the lines of least resistance, &c., or, in the jargon of the\r\ncraniologists, that he has a naval-architectural bump on his skull;\r\nyet one would think that such was the case, when we see men, we\r\ncannot say philosophers, start up and loudly assert that they are\r\nin possession of the secret of construction; and they are believed\r\nbecause their hypotheses are never submitted to the examination of\r\nthose who are capable of detecting their fallacy.\r\n\r\nThe Experimental Squadrons have, with a multitude of perplexing\r\nresults, elicited, it must be confessed, at least an interesting\r\nfact, viz. that there has been an establishment seventeen years in\r\nthis country, in Portsmouth dockyard, for the scientific education\r\nof naval architects, for the Royal [p027] Navy.[8] From the plan of\r\neducation, as laid down by the Commissioners of Naval Revision in\r\n1810, it appears that, to a requisite knowledge of the _practice_\r\nof their profession, the gentlemen composing this body of naval\r\nconstructors unite a sound and competent one of its _theory_[9].\r\n\r\nIt can only be from such a source that we can look for the\r\nimprovement of our men of war, and it is to be regretted that every\r\nmeans should not be taken to avail ourselves of it: but unhappily\r\nsuch is the force of prejudice that, unless some alteration should be\r\nadopted in this institution, it will be in vain to expect advantage\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe objection urged against this establishment, namely, that the\r\nscientific education it gives to its members precludes them from the\r\nattainment of a due knowledge of the practical construction of our\r\nships, is so absurd, that none but weak or jealous minds could ever\r\nhave brought it forward. Shall it be laid down, in the present age,\r\nas an axiom, that a profound ignorance of the principles of his art\r\nis the one thing essential to the formation of what is generally\r\nmeant by the term “practical man?” We contend that, having made,\r\n_in vain_,[10] a long and most indulgent trial of a system without\r\nscience, if we may use such an expression, we must extend to one\r\nin alliance with it, a like patronage, before we can be allowed to\r\npronounce a fair and legitimate judgment upon its efficiency.\r\n\r\nBut even in the peculiar path in which the naval architects educated\r\nat Portsmouth might be supposed to excel, we do not find that any\r\nopportunity is allowed them to come forward, nor shall we see this\r\nuntil some effort is made by the heads of our naval departments, to\r\nallow a broad and open competition to take place. It may be urged,\r\nthat the learned Professor at Portsmouth (Dr. Inman) in himself\r\nincludes all that can have [p028] possibly been taught or understood\r\nin the establishment over which he presides, and that therefore he\r\nis the representative of it in the late and present trials for the\r\npalm of excellence; but we cannot by any means assent to this: many\r\nof the students must have left his tuition seven, eight, and nine\r\nyears, and must be between thirty and forty years of age; and it\r\nwould be strange indeed, if during such a period, and in the prime\r\nof life and intellect, some of these, if not all, had not cultivated\r\nthe science after their own bent of mind, and formed original ideas\r\non the subject: we say, therefore, that Dr. Inman’s constructions\r\ncannot be called the production of the establishment—they are merely\r\nthe effort of one man, whose attention it appears is distracted by a\r\nmultiplicity of occupations, and can only, along with the vessels of\r\nCapts. Symonds, Hayes, and Sir R. Seppings, be deemed criterions of\r\nthe particular views of an individual.\r\n\r\nMysticism and ignorance always accompany each other; and we may\r\nreckon that in proportion as the latter disappears from amongst our\r\nship-builders, so will the absurd vagaries of the former recede, and\r\nthe subject be placed at last on the true principles of philosophical\r\ninduction, instead of the caprices of imagination. We look forward,\r\ntherefore, to this new body of naval architects for the expulsion of\r\nall quackery from their profession, and for the exposition not only\r\nof what we really do know, but also of what we do not know about it:\r\nthis is the only way to arrive at truth, which should be the sole\r\nobject of all investigation; but which we are afraid has hitherto\r\nbeen sadly garbled and perverted wherever it has had to do with naval\r\narchitecture in this country.\r\n\r\nBut we repeat that we do not see that the nation is at all likely to\r\nbenefit from the science or exertions of those gentlemen so long as\r\nthey are placed in situations where a superior education can have no\r\nother effect than producing disgust and chagrin in the mind of the\r\npossessor; and if the institution at Portsmouth be designed for no\r\nbetter purpose than that of supplying house-carpenters, joiners, and\r\nstill more inferior trades, with foremen, it had better be abolished.\r\nSome would regard it, as at present used, as a gross mockery on the\r\npublic [p029] at whose expense it is supported; it is certainly a\r\ncruel one of those who have been induced, by the fair and brilliant\r\nprospects held out to them of support and encouragement, to devote\r\ntheir lives to this branch of the public service.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Experimental Squadron: it is with regret that\r\nwe must conclude, upon a careful consideration, that, although the\r\nexperiments are carried on with so much vigour and interest, they are\r\nevidently founded on imaginative views, and that there cannot exist\r\nany thing like legitimate data where so many failures and anomalous\r\nresults obtain. Who can read the account of the first Experimental\r\nSquadron[11], without immediately perceiving that the constructors\r\nof the contending vessels, however sanguine each might have been of\r\nthe success of his particular fancy, met with nothing but the most\r\nperplexing results? We see sometimes one and sometimes the other\r\nvessel claim the palm of excellence, and finally leaving the subject\r\nas much in the dark as ever. This is the natural consequence of the\r\nnon-application of inductive philosophy to the question before us,\r\nand the most important conclusion that can be gathered from the\r\nexperiment is, that we have begun at the wrong end, and that it is\r\nhigh time to employ analysis instead of synthesis to effect the\r\ndesired objects: for in the present state of the theory of naval\r\nconstruction in this country, there are yet no data existing to\r\neffect with precision and confidence the synthetical composition of a\r\nship.\r\n\r\nWe cannot refrain here from noticing the paucity of information\r\ncontained in the reports hitherto made on the first Experimental\r\nSquadron. The best one[11] is but little removed from a ship’s\r\nlog book, and in some respects is inferior to it: it is of such\r\na scanty nature, that we can scarcely inform ourselves on any\r\npoint, and that only in a _relative_ degree, of the qualities of\r\nthe vessels composing it: we cannot find out any mention of their\r\n_absolute_ velocities on the different points of sailing, which is\r\na most important omission. We are neither informed in what way the\r\nobservations were conducted, whether they were made simultaneously\r\nor not: unless the former, any attempt at comparison must be very\r\ndoubtful, if not entirely fallacious. Circumstances of wind and\r\nthe weather may very widely alter in the [p030] course of a short\r\ntime, and every endeavour at legitimate analogy be destroyed by such\r\nvariation. We strongly suspect that this is one cause of perplexity;\r\nand another prolific one is the vague idea given of the strength of\r\nwinds by nautical language. Nothing but the determinations of the\r\nanemometer should ever be allowed to appear in an account of such\r\nexperiments. Every circumstance attendant on the quantity and trim of\r\nsail, the heeling, the rolling and pitching of the ship, position of\r\nthe rudder, &c. should be accurately ascertained and _tabulated_; for\r\nit is next to an impossibility and a wilful waste of time to attempt\r\nto institute comparisons without pursuing a system of tabulated\r\nresults, which should be kept in the same form on board each ship.\r\n\r\nWe must also express our regret that the scientific professor at\r\nPortsmouth does not appear to have ascertained the position of the\r\ncentre of gravity of any of his ships, with regard to height, by the\r\nsimple and easy experiment long known in principle, and described\r\nlately with geometrical rigidity in two or three publications by\r\nsome of his pupils[12]. The knowledge of the position of this point\r\nwould have placed him so far above his competitors, in so many\r\nimportant particulars, that we are surprised he should have thrown\r\naway his advantage, and descended to a level with his less scientific\r\nopponents. We are afraid that, here again, imaginative views have\r\nstepped in, and taken the sober mathematician from the only path by\r\nwhich excellence can be attained. We are at a loss to conceive how\r\nthe stabilities of his ships can be said to be ascertained without\r\nthe knowledge of the position of this point.\r\n\r\nSome of the obscurity which pervades this difficult subject may be\r\novercome, as to broad and general principles, by attentively and\r\n_coolly_ observing the progress of marine architecture, since the\r\nintroduction of cannon into naval warfare, and more particularly\r\nduring the last century and a half. We shall then clearly perceive\r\nthat the French, who, as early as the beginning of the reign of Louis\r\nXIV., employed men of first-rate talent in their naval arsenals,\r\nand neglected no opportunity for the [p031] advancement of science\r\nin them, increased and kept increasing the dimensions of their\r\nships, more especially the length, the ratio of which to the breadth\r\nhas been augmented by them from about 3-1/4.1, to 4.1 within the\r\nlast century. While this principle was acted on, the improvement\r\nof their ships was gradual; and by referring to our own progress\r\nin the art, in tardy imitation of the practice of the French, we\r\nshall likewise conclude that our navy has derived precisely similar\r\nadvantages from the same causes. Here we have at once two grand but\r\n_concurring_ results derived from an experiment, not made on one or\r\nhalf a dozen different vessels, but on the whole navies of the two\r\nmost powerful maritime states in the world: and if to these we choose\r\nto add the result of the practice of the same means on the Spanish\r\nand other navies, we might surely be warranted in saying, from this\r\nbroad but _certain analysis_ of _facts_, that, in relation to the\r\nhull, the _general increase of dimensions, with a greater relative\r\nlength_, is one cause of the improvements that have been made in the\r\nsea-going qualities of the ships composing the fleets of the present\r\nmaritime powers: the question therefore that remains to be decided\r\non in relation to this principle is, whether we have arrived at its\r\nutmost practicable limits, or rather, whether we have arrived at the\r\n_maximum_ of improvement it is capable of producing.\r\n\r\nThis brings us again to the experimental squadrons, as far as they\r\nare connected with, and illustrative of, our observations; and the\r\nfirst question naturally put forward about them is, whether there be\r\nany thing very peculiar in the formation or dimensions of the rival\r\nvessels? We suspect that the answer cannot otherwise than disclose,\r\nthat neither in principle, dimensions, nor in the formation, can they\r\nbe said to differ very materially from each other, or from ships of\r\nthe common construction: indeed we perceive in some a retrogression\r\nof ideas and a violation of the principle, that the increase of the\r\nratio of the length to the breadth, in conjunction with a general\r\nincrease of dimensions, has been a predominant cause of improvement.\r\nThe fact also of so immaterial a difference necessarily includes a\r\nsystem of masting and sails equally confined, and totally inadequate\r\nto produce any great superiority of sailing over ships to which they\r\nare so nearly equal in principal dimensions. [p032]\r\n\r\nAfter so many years of trial with the present nearly invariable set\r\nof principal dimensions, during which period it may be said, that\r\nevery possible contour of hull has been experimented on with them,\r\nwe are inclined to think that almost all has been done that could\r\nbe done under such restrictions, and that some great step must be\r\nmade in one or other of the principal dimensions themselves, with\r\ncorrespondent alterations in the masting, before we can expect to\r\nsee a decided and great improvement in the sailing of our ships.\r\nThe depth is an element which has arrived at its limit from very\r\napparent external causes; but the length and breadth remain to the\r\nskilful constructor without any such clogs to his endeavours; and\r\nhe has only to accommodate their relation to each other in the\r\nmanner most conducive to velocity, which in our opinion is the very\r\ncapital object of naval construction, both in ships of war and of\r\ncommerce. That it is so in the former, no one will, we apprehend, on\r\ndue reflection deny; but there will be many who will assert that it\r\ncannot be obtained, in the latter, without a sacrifice of capacity;\r\nwhich will defeat the object of carrying large cargoes: to this\r\nwe may reply, that if a vessel with an expense of one quarter the\r\ncapacity can make _three_ voyages instead of _two_, will not the\r\nmerchant be still a considerable gainer in capacity, and still more\r\nso by a ready return of his capital[13]?\r\n\r\nAll observations on well-conducted experiments concur in proving that\r\nvelocity is gained by increasing the length, to a much greater degree\r\nin relation to the breadth, than has ever yet been done in ships; and\r\nthat the increase of the same element contributes to their weathering\r\npowers is too obvious to need insisting upon: it is also generally\r\nadvantageous, when not carried to an extent which would seriously\r\nretard the manœuvring of the ship. This limit has not yet by any\r\nmeans been determined; for it must be recollected, that although\r\nthe additional length increases the resistance to rotation about a\r\nvertical axis, yet the power of the sails to give rotation about the\r\nsame is also increased, although not in so high a ratio. The power of\r\nthe rudder to produce rotation is also greater in a long ship than\r\nin [p033] a short one, not only on account of the greater distance\r\nit is from the axis of rotation, but also on account of the greater\r\nvelocity, and the more direct impulse of the water on it.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the ratio of the length to the breadth to produce\r\nvelocity should not interfere with the increase of breadth necessary\r\nto produce stability or capacity; for both these qualities, varying\r\nas higher powers of the breadth, a very small increase of breadth may\r\nbe attended with a considerable increase of length. If we compare\r\nthe Caledonia’s (120 guns) dimensions with those of the Royal George\r\nand Queen Charlotte[14], of 1788 and 1789, we shall find, that 13\r\nor 14 times as much length as breadth has been added to the first\r\nrates of our navy. If we refer to the dimensions of the Commerce\r\nde Marseilles, and those of the next preceding three-decker of the\r\nFrench navy (for instance, the Ville de Paris[15], taken in Lord\r\nRodney’s action), we shall find that the French naval architects gave\r\nin her 21 times as much increase to the length as to the breadth. If\r\nthis could be done with safety in a three-decked ship, with such a\r\nvast top weight, much more could it be carried advantageously into\r\neffect in ships of two decks, and frigates; but we do not find, in\r\nthe latter classes of the ships of the French navy, the increase of\r\nlength to go beyond six times that of the breadth. If we refer to the\r\nOld Bellerophon, built in 1772, and the New Bellerophon, built in\r\n1819, we shall find an increase of 24 feet in length, to 1.58 feet\r\nincrease of breadth; or the former more than 15 times the latter[16].\r\n\r\nTo those who oppose the objection that a greater length than at\r\npresent used would make the manœuvring of a ship too slow, we answer,\r\nthat as the Caledonia and the present first rates of our navy,\r\nalthough from 10 to 15 feet longer than our two-deckers, are found to\r\nbe capital ships in this respect, there is a sure ground to believe,\r\nthat the addition of 20 feet in length to the present two-deckers\r\nwould not render their celerity [p034] of evolution less than that of\r\nthe three-decker; and since, from the reduction of weight aloft, the\r\ncentre of gravity would be lowered, and the displacement required to\r\nbe less, a somewhat smaller breadth might be allowed to a two-decked\r\nship of 206 feet long, than to one of 196 feet (especially since\r\nthe quantity of sail, remaining the same, is lowered by one whole\r\ndepth between deck), a smaller midship section would be, _cæteris\r\nparibus_, required; the velocity of this ship might be considerably\r\nincreased. Nothing however can be precisely determined on, with such\r\na complication of circumstances, beyond a general idea. Calculation\r\nand a strict analysis of ships must be resorted to, in order to fill\r\nup the outline of our reasoning.\r\n\r\nBut for the same reason that we imagine that an addition of 20 or\r\nperhaps 40 feet would not sensibly injure the celerity of manœuvring\r\nof our two-deckers, we should think that the same increase of this\r\ndimension might be tried without much risk to our first rates, with\r\nan increase of breadth not exceeding 1/20th part that is given to the\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nWe repeat that the very capital object of the science of Naval\r\nConstruction is _velocity_, and we are decidedly of opinion that\r\nit is attainable in a much higher degree than at present, without\r\ncompromising other necessary qualities, for which we have the\r\nconcurrence of facts as far as they go.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Americans, in the last war, took every possible advantage\r\nsuggested by views similar to those we have been adverting to, in\r\nthe construction of their large frigates. They had, it may be said,\r\nto create a martial navy, and they had to oppose it against fearful\r\nodds; but, free from the prejudices and errors so blindly cherished\r\nby their opponents, and which constantly oppose reform by always\r\ndeclaring the present practice to be the best, they did not retread\r\nthe old path, but began at its last step, and boldly advanced on\r\nthis principle into all the branches of the art. They built vessels\r\nupon the most enlarged dimensions, and of a superior weight of\r\nmetal, and gave an increased ratio of length to the breadth. The\r\nresult of such a procedure, justified the confidence of the American\r\nnaval architects in only _one_ maxim, founded upon the _scientific_\r\nobservation of facts, and may give us a faint idea of what might\r\nbe effected by a still more enlarged and mathematical analysis.\r\n[p035] Our frigates were so inferior to theirs in every way, that\r\nthey brought nothing but disasters upon us, excepting in the action\r\nbetween the Shannon and Chesapeake, and one or two others, where,\r\nassured by their previous successes, our gallant opponents threw away\r\nthe advantages possessed by their ships, by coming to close quarters\r\nat once, and deciding the contest hand to hand.—Our ships of the line\r\ncould never bring these frigates to action, and owing alone to their\r\nextraordinary sailing, did they evade and mock a large British fleet.\r\nWe were finally obliged to build 60-gun frigates after their method,\r\nbut when it was _too late_ for the exigency of the period; and thus\r\nit has ever been our fate, for want of science in the constructors of\r\nour navy, to follow the steps of our enemies at a humble distance,\r\nand to be only then driven out of the old track by a terrible\r\nexperience of its inefficiency.\r\n\r\nNor have the Americans stopped here;—Mr. Huskisson plainly tells us\r\nthat “America is, year after year, augmenting its military marine, by\r\nbuilding ships of war of the largest class[17].” According to Capt.\r\nBrenton, they have built a first-rate[18] of 245 feet length on the\r\ngun deck, and 56 feet broad[19], to carry 42-pounders on the lower\r\ndeck, and 32-pounders on the other decks.\r\n\r\nOur small class of 74-gun ships lately converted into frigates\r\ncarrying _fifty_ 32-pounder guns, we are fearful can only produce\r\ndisappointment if ever brought against the American frigates (not by\r\nconversion, but by _construction_), which carry _sixty-two_ guns of\r\nthe same calibre, and are 180 feet long on the gun deck.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget also that our active neighbours the French have\r\nnow adopted a most formidable description of [p036] frigates, with\r\ncurvilinear sterns[20], and many other important improvements. They\r\nmount 60 guns and carronades—viz. 24-pounders on the gun deck, and\r\n36-pounder carronades on the flush deck.—The former calibre is\r\nequivalent very nearly to 26, and the latter to 39 lbs. avoirdupois.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on these circumstances, we cannot but feel surprised\r\nthat so many frigates of inferior force and dimensions should be\r\nbuilding in our dockyards. In time of emergency they will only bring\r\non us a repetition of former disasters and deficiency. We contend\r\nthat, instead of building ships of only _equal_ force to those of our\r\nrivals, and thus _waiting_ for the developement of _their_ designs\r\nbefore we can venture on a single step, we should build beyond them\r\nin every respect. It must and ought to be recollected, that peace in\r\nthese matters produces a contest of intellect, and those will have\r\nthe advantage in it who attack instead of standing on the defensive.\r\nWe ought to lead the way, and to be at the head of the maritime\r\nworld, not in _number_ alone, but also in the _individual force and\r\nqualities_ of our ships.\r\n\r\nHaving expatiated on the advantages of an increased ratio of length\r\nto breadth in relation to the hull of a ship, we will just glance\r\nat some of the principal effects it would have upon the masting\r\nand sails; and here again we conceive that Professor Inman has, in\r\ncommon with many others, relinquished the many good effects resulting\r\nfrom it, for the inadequate one, of being able to carry a somewhat\r\ngreater quantity of sail, which must necessarily be lofty, and which,\r\n(setting aside this detracting circumstance,) as the velocity of a\r\nship varies only as a _fractional_ power of the surface of canvas\r\nspread, cannot produce the degree of fast sailing to be wished for,\r\nbut at an immense and impracticable quantity of sail[21].\r\n\r\nA greater proof of the inadequacy of the present system of [p037]\r\nlofty sail cannot be cited than the fact of its not procuring, under\r\nthe most favourable circumstances, a rate of sailing rarely exceeding\r\none-fourth the velocity of the wind.\r\n\r\nAs the number of masts should be so regulated as to create facility\r\nin managing the canvas, which is well known to be at present hardly\r\nmanageable in a gale of wind, on board large ships, from the enormous\r\nsize of each individual course and topsail, we should not hesitate,\r\ntherefore, to have _four_ vertical masts, as recommended by Bouguer,\r\ninstead of three, in ships built in accordance with the principles\r\nwe have been discussing. This would, _cæteris paribus_, require\r\nshorter masting and smaller yards, and the sails being much less,\r\nindividually, would be more easily managed and not so liable to\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, and the actual experiments now pending, it\r\nis apparent that the theoretic construction of ships is at a very\r\nlow ebb in this country; yet a fine opportunity now presents itself,\r\nif we choose to avail ourselves of it, for rescuing the nation from\r\nthis generally acknowledged odium. Let a proper use be made of the\r\ncorps of Naval Architects we have, somehow or other, at last got, and\r\nlet their exertions, under a degree of encouragement equal to that\r\nbestowed on the old ship-builders _in vain_ for so long a period, be\r\ndirected towards the improvement of their art. If they fail, they\r\ncannot claim the excuse of having their endeavours repressed; if they\r\nsucceed, as no doubt they will, in advancing their profession to\r\nsomething beyond mere carpentry, we shall be enabled to bid adieu to\r\nthe old and _ruinous_ method of blundering, under the reign of which\r\nnothing but disappointment can ever be reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nWe have seen and do still see the immense advantages derived by our\r\ncountry from the encouragement of those branches of science connected\r\nwith its manufactures and agriculture; and if we wish to keep our\r\npresent superiority, we must follow up vigorously this principle in\r\nall its universality. To the cavils of ignorance and bigotry against\r\nsuch a mode of proceeding we would answer, in the words of one of\r\nthe most enlightened members of the present administration, “This\r\ncountry cannot stand still, whilst others are advancing in science,\r\nin [p038] industry, in every thing which contributes to increase the\r\npower of empires, and to multiply the means of comfort and enjoyment\r\nto civilized man.”[22]\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped, therefore, that His Royal Highness the Lord High\r\nAdmiral will extend to this most important national institution, the\r\nSchool of Naval Architecture, the same vigilant and scrutinizing\r\neye that every other branch of our naval system is at this moment\r\nexperiencing from him, and that he will extend to it that fair play\r\nand encouragement which has hitherto been denied to it. As a seaman,\r\nhe can fully appreciate and understand how much the bad qualities of\r\na ship may neutralize the best exertions of the most experienced and\r\nskilful sailor; and, on the contrary, what a degree of confidence\r\nmay be insured in naval operations with excellent ships. We feel\r\npersuaded, therefore, that he will not allow others to think for him\r\nin a matter of so much national importance, and thus allow private\r\nends to interpose to the disadvantage of public views; but that he\r\nwill investigate and judge for himself. We would humbly suggest to\r\nHis Royal Highness to inquire into the individual acquirements and\r\nproductions, both of a _theoretical_ and _practical_ nature, of those\r\nwho have been educated in this establishment, and he would soon be\r\nable to decide whether they be fitting or not for the important task\r\nof constructing our ships, and for the confidence and protection\r\nwhich we think we have shown has hitherto been ill-advisedly withheld\r\nfrom them. Such a line of conduct would very soon carry our naval\r\narchitecture to a pitch of excellence _worthy_ of imitation, and\r\ninstead of being indebted to foreigners for models, we should be\r\nable, with just pride, to point to the productions of British science\r\nand intellect in this noble art.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [7] By referring to Lloyd’s List, it will appear, upon a moderate\r\n average, that _three_ English merchant vessels are lost every _two_\r\n days!\r\n\r\n [8] See No. II. of the Naval and Military Magazine, published in\r\n June last.\r\n\r\n [9] This will be readily acknowledged by those who will choose\r\n to read the “Papers on Naval Architecture,” and the “Essays and\r\n Gleanings on Naval Architecture,” two periodical works proceeding\r\n from the members of this institution.\r\n\r\n [10] See the Third Report of the Commissioners of Naval Revision,\r\n and the Resolutions of the Society for the Improvement of Naval\r\n Architecture, in which the old system of providing ship-builders for\r\n the Royal Navy is condemned in the most unqualified terms.\r\n\r\n [11] Vide No. 1 of the Papers on Naval Architecture.\r\n\r\n [12] Vide Annals of Philosophy, for November, 1826; No. 1 of the\r\n Papers on Naval Architecture, and No. 11 of the Essays and Gleanings\r\n on Naval Architecture.\r\n\r\n [13] Foreign nations, and more particularly the Americans, find\r\n their advantage in having swift merchant ships, and therefore our\r\n assertion is warranted by facts.\r\n\r\n [14] Caledonia, length 205 feet, breadth 53.5; Royal George, length\r\n 187 feet, breadth 52.33 feet; Queen Charlotte, length 190 feet,\r\n breadth 52.33 feet.\r\n\r\n [15] Ville de Paris, length 185.62 feet; breadth 52.7 feet; Commerce\r\n de Marseilles, length 208.33 feet, breadth 54.79 feet.\r\n\r\n [16] Old Bellerophon, length 168 feet, breadth 47.33 feet; New\r\n Bellerophon, length 192 feet, breadth 49 feet.\r\n\r\n [17] Vide this gentleman’s speech on the Shipping Interests in the\r\n House of Commons, May 1827.\r\n\r\n [18] Called by Capt.

No. II.\r\n\r\n [Communicated by J. Mac Culloch, M. D., F. R. S., &c. &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving pointed out, in the former paper on this subject, the nature\r\nof the soils or places, of whatever description, by which malaria is\r\ngenerated, it remains to notice a few other circumstances connected\r\nwith its natural history, a knowledge of which is essential for\r\nthe purposes of prevention; and finally to describe such modes of\r\nprevention, applicable to these several circumstances, as have\r\nbeen found useful in guarding against the attack of diseases from\r\nthis cause. Under the first head, there remain to be considered,\r\nthe effects of climate and season; the changes which occur in the\r\nproduction and propagation of malaria, from various natural and\r\nartificial causes; and also, the various modes in which it is\r\npropagated.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked, that a certain elevation of temperature\r\nwas necessary to the production of this poison, though what the\r\nprecise degree is, has not been ascertained; and as this is, chiefly,\r\nwhat distinguishes the regions or periods of the year which generate\r\nmalaria, I need not make two divisions of season and climate. If,\r\nhowever, this temperature is not fixed, it will perhaps suffice\r\nfor our present purposes to say that the greater part of Scotland,\r\nwhether as to climate or season, seems incapable of generating the\r\ndisease from this cause; though there are exceptions of a permanent\r\nnature, or exceptions of climate, as was perennially true of the\r\nCarse of Gowrie before its drainage; while there are others which\r\nhappen when, as in the last year, there has been a peculiarly hot\r\nsummer, and which are exceptions of season.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is as to more northern regions; where a hot summer\r\nbecomes more than an equivalent for an average low temperature;\r\nas an example of which, there is no place where intermittents are\r\nmore severe and abundant than at Stockholm. But the extreme of evil\r\nfrom this cause occurs, as is well known, in the tropical climates;\r\nappearing almost proportioned to the heat of the climate, and what is\r\nimportant to observe to the moisture also. The destructive effects of\r\ncertain parts of Africa, India, America, and so forth, are familiarly\r\nknown; and [p040] it is in these countries especially, that the\r\ndiseases from this source constitute nearly the entire mortality of\r\nthe human race. And thus, for Europe, it is in Spain, Italy, and\r\nGreece, and chiefly on their Mediterranean shores, that the activity\r\nof malaria scarcely yields to that of the intertropical climates;\r\nwhile in France, Holland, Germany, Hungary, and with us, in a far\r\nless degree, the production will be found regulated by the heat of\r\nthe summers, all other circumstances being the same.\r\n\r\nAnd if we thus account for the variations in the quantity and\r\nvirulence of diseases in any given country, for noted seasons of\r\nepidemic in the countries which I have just named, and for the great\r\nprevalence of fevers among ourselves during the last few years, and\r\nparticularly in the last summer, there is another point of scarcely\r\ninferior importance to be taken into the consideration, independently\r\nof that which relates to peculiar winds as connected with the\r\npropagation of this poison;—and this is, moisture.\r\n\r\nI need not repeat that water in some form is necessary to the\r\nproduction of that peculiar vegetable decomposition which is the\r\nsource of this poison; and so true is this, that even in the\r\ntropical regions, the diseases from this cause are nearly unknown in\r\ndistricts of peculiar dryness, as they are in the drier seasons of\r\nthose countries. Thus, for example, Egypt is free from such fevers,\r\nexcept at the period of the subsidence of the Nile, unless where,\r\nas at Damietta, the cultivation of rice is pursued; and the same is\r\ntrue of Mesopotamia very remarkably: and if I dare not extend these\r\nillustrations, I must remark that in all these cases, the action of\r\nmoisture is twofold, inasmuch as it not only accelerates vegetable\r\ndecomposition, but renders the atmosphere a fitter conductor of this\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nTaking these two causes of the increase in the quantity and in the\r\naction of malaria, we can explain many particulars which relate\r\nto its power in producing diseases: and as the knowledge of these\r\nis important as far as relates to the main object of this paper,\r\nprevention, it becomes necessary to explain them at a little more\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nAs to season, the simplest case is that of the intertropical\r\nclimates; and Africa offers the plainest instance among the [p041]\r\nwhole. There, the malaria and the fever commence at the moment the\r\nrain falls; diminishing as the ground becomes thoroughly wetted,\r\nand recommencing as it dries. The explanation of all this ought to\r\nbe obvious; and the same analogy governs all the hotter climates,\r\nas, though less conspicuously, it does our own. Hence we explain,\r\nboth as to our spring and our autumn, the effects of heat following\r\nrain, or the reverse, and the diseases which are consequent on those\r\nchanges: and thus it is, though more remarkably, in Italy, that a\r\nrainy autumn increases the number and severity of fevers; or, if the\r\nsummer has been unusually dry, that they often do not appear till the\r\ncommencement of the autumnal, or even the winter rains. And hence,\r\nalso, even with us, the occurrence of a single rainy day or week, in\r\nthe midst of the heats, will produce fevers; while the effect of this\r\ninfluence is such, that should there even be an entire rainy summer,\r\nand the subsequent one be hot and dry, this will be attended by an\r\nunusual production of malaria and disease.\r\n\r\nAnd if I cannot detail all the various modes in which these\r\ncircumstances may be modified, and how their effects may vary, it\r\nwill be useful to make one remark on an error as relating to it which\r\nis universal among us, and into which even Lind has fallen. The error\r\nis, to think that the rain, the moisture, or the cold is itself the\r\ncause of the diseases which follow this state of things; while it is\r\nobviously a case analogous to that of Africa, if less severe, and the\r\nmalaria is produced by these circumstances on soils which I formerly\r\npointed out, and which Lind, like every one else, had neglected. But\r\nif I must pass over many interesting and useful conclusions to be\r\ndrawn from these general principles, there is one fact which I must\r\nnotice, and it is this:—\r\n\r\nIn spring, the combination of heat and moisture, easily explained,\r\ngenerates, most commonly, intermittents; or the effect of the malaria\r\nat this season differs from what it does in autumn: while as the\r\nheat advances and the ground dries, this kind of fever ceases to be\r\nproduced, a new species, or the summer remittent, taking its place\r\nwhen the heat and the moisture of autumn begin to act. But under\r\npeculiar seasons of heat and moisture with us, it sometimes occurs,\r\nas it has done [p042] within the last years, that the intermittent\r\nseason runs into the remittent one, or there is no midsummer interval\r\nof freedom from disease; while it has also happened, and in some\r\nparts of England in this last year, that what would have been\r\nintermittent fever in other years has been remittent; or the common\r\nfever has occupied the whole summer, continuously, even from March to\r\nNovember, as is the case in the worst regions of southern Europe.\r\n\r\nNow, under these exceptions, which I was bound to explain, the\r\ncommencement of intermittent, or of vernal ague, may be fixed about\r\nthe middle or end of March, and its termination similarly in May;\r\nwhile that of remittent may be placed in the beginning of August,\r\nand its termination with the middle or end of October. How these\r\nperiods may otherwise be affected by the more or less insalubrious\r\nnature of the district or place, will easily be judged of by those\r\nwho will reflect for themselves on what I dare not explain, lest I\r\nshould infringe too far on my limits. All else that I can venture\r\non, as to this part of the question in hand, relates to the effects\r\nof the different times of the day on the production, propagation, or\r\ninfluence of malaria, and it is one which is of no small importance\r\nin a practical view.\r\n\r\nWhether the changes as to temperature and moisture which occur within\r\nthe space of twenty-four hours, affect the production or propagation\r\nof malaria, I will not here inquire minutely, from the fear of\r\nprolonging this very limited paper; but the general facts, as to its\r\neffects, are these: If we commence with the sun on the meridian,\r\nthere appears, even in the worst climates, very little hazard of\r\nfever; while in Italy, it is believed that there is, generally,\r\nlittle or no hazard, except in some peculiarly pestilential places,\r\nand under particular kinds of inattention or neglect. Either the\r\nmalaria is decomposed or destroyed by the heat, or else the air from\r\nits dryness ceases to be a conductor; but as evening approaches,\r\nits influence becomes powerful and dangerous, being supposed most\r\ngenerally to extend all through the night; while in some parts\r\nof that country it is a popular belief that it terminates before\r\nmidnight, or with the precipitation of the atmospheric moisture.\r\nWhether this last opinion is true or not, the general fact explains\r\nthe popular [p043] belief, and truth, respecting the poisonous\r\neffects of dew in the hot climates; the supposed pernicious quality\r\nof this depending evidently on the malaria by which its formation is\r\naccompanied. And in this case it is probable that the evil arises,\r\nnot from a fresh or peculiar generation of malaria, but from the mere\r\nfact that the moist atmosphere is a better conductor than a dry one.\r\n\r\nNot to be unnecessarily minute, we thus also explain the danger of\r\nexposure to the morning air in similar situations; the facts, as\r\nthey relate to the conducting of malaria, being the same, though the\r\nmeteorological circumstances are somewhat different. Hence, also, we\r\nsee why the grey mists which hang over wet grounds in the evening\r\nin our own climate, are esteemed pernicious; the truth, however,\r\nbeing, that they are perfectly innocent at certain seasons and in\r\ncertain places—as in the greater part of Scotland, for example, or in\r\nthose places and at those periods where malaria is not produced. The\r\ndistinction is valuable, because of the inconvenience of restrictions\r\non this subject, and because to know where the hazard really lies\r\nis to reduce those, and also to prevent the infraction of rules by\r\nnot extending them beyond what is necessary; and thus also by seeing\r\nwhat are the real dangers of what is called night air, we more easily\r\navoid them. Night air is avoided now, under a false philosophy,\r\nbecause it is cold or damp, or for some other vague reason; while\r\nthe dangers from mere dampness or cold are as nothing compared to\r\nthose here pointed out; which also occur precisely where they are\r\nleast feared, namely, in warm summer evenings, after refreshing\r\nshowers, and so forth. Hence it is that fevers are produced in\r\nsummer, in rural situations, and especially perhaps amid the most\r\nengaging scenery, by evening walks and exposure to what is naturally\r\nconsidered, as it is felt to be, a balmy and refreshing sequel to\r\na hot day. Let this be enjoyed where it can with safety, and as it\r\noften may; but such evening walks will not be safe in any of those\r\nsituations which I need not repeat here; after having detailed them\r\nas I have done in the former paper. And lest I should be accused of\r\nwishing to excite unnecessary alarm, I consider, on the contrary,\r\nthat it ought to be diminished by these remarks; because, if we\r\ntake the whole of [p044] England, there is perhaps not one acre in\r\na hundred thousand where there is danger from night air, or from\r\nmalaria in any mode; so that to distinguish where that lies, is to\r\nhave relieved from useless fears all those who may learn to make the\r\ndistinctions under review.\r\n\r\nTo pass from what relates to climate and season, and to proceed to\r\nthe propagation, simply, of malaria, it is almost superfluous to\r\nsay, that its influence, as to the production of disease, is much\r\nregulated by proximity, which implies a state of concentration or\r\naccumulation. Hence the danger arising from vicinity; while, as I\r\nformerly remarked, where the generating source is small, this becomes\r\nnecessary to its effect, since dilution may be expected to destroy\r\nthe power of the poison.\r\n\r\nFor analogous reasons, its effect in the production of disease is\r\nincreased by concentration or condensation; and such a state of\r\nthings takes place in narrow and confined valleys, or in places\r\nsurrounded by woods, or in woods themselves; in any situation, in\r\nshort, where the poison is produced, and is so sheltered from winds\r\nthat ventilation becomes difficult. And if it is probable that this\r\nis one chief reason of the peculiarly insalubrious nature of woods\r\nand jungles in hot climates, so is it an universal remark in Italy,\r\nthat the short valleys in which the air cannot circulate are among\r\nthe most pestilential spots. And if this explains, also, in some\r\nmeasure, the bad effects of calm weather, so does it account for the\r\nunusually pestiferous nature of rivers and lakes confined within\r\nwood, as are those of the tropical climates, and as there are many\r\nalso in different parts of Europe. That we ourselves are not exempt\r\nfrom these additional causes of the influence of malaria, would be\r\neasily shown by many references, were it not for the reason which has\r\ncaused me to exclude them.\r\n\r\nIt is another important question for practice, how far and in what\r\nmanner malaria can be conveyed by the winds to places where it is not\r\nproduced, so as to act in exciting disease. That it is conveyed to\r\ncertain distances by winds is amply proved by an abundant experience,\r\nand I may first detail a few of the most useful particulars as to\r\nthis fact. In Italy and Greece, it is observed, that where long\r\nvalleys terminate on sea shores, on which the exits of the rivers are\r\nswampy, it is an [p045] effect of the sea breeze, by crossing such\r\nmarshy ground, to convey the malaria up into the interior country,\r\nto considerable distances, and to places which are in themselves\r\nnot insalubrious. Thus, also, does such a breeze, especially when\r\nit is a warm wind, convey the poison up the acclivities of hills,\r\neven to a considerable range of distance or elevation; a process\r\nfacilitated by the natural tendency of such winds to ascend. And as\r\na striking proof of this migration of malaria, it appears from Capt.\r\nSmyth’s statistical account of the insalubrious villages in Sicily,\r\nthat out of more than seventy, about one-half are not seated near or\r\non lands producing this substance, but on acclivities, at varying\r\ndistances—thus receiving it through migration. The same is remarked\r\nby Montfalcon of many towns in France; while in some, the place at\r\na distance is even more unhealthy than that which is immediately\r\nsituated in the marsh itself: and in our own country, this is equally\r\nsaid to be true of the backwater at Weymouth, and of the marshes of\r\nSt. Blasey in Cornwall, acting more powerfully at some distance than\r\nin the immediate spot.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the absolute distance to which the malaria can be\r\nconveyed, it is yet an obscure circumstance, or at least the maximum\r\nhas not been fixed; but it is at least ascertained that the convent\r\nof Camaldoli receives it from the Lake Agnano, at a distance of three\r\nmiles; while from certain naval reports, a distance of five miles has\r\nbeen proved to permit its transmission,—and from an evidence that\r\ncannot be doubted, inasmuch as it was the sudden breaking out of\r\nfever in a healthy ship, anchored at that distance from the shore,\r\non the coming off of the land wind, attended by its peculiar and\r\nwell-known smell.\r\n\r\nThese facts are satisfactory thus far, and it would be abundantly\r\neasy to add to them; but there is reason to suspect that it can\r\nbe conveyed to far greater distances, in certain favourable\r\ncircumstances: those reasons, in the first place, being derived from\r\ncertain meteorological analogies and considerations, and in the next\r\nconfirmed by experience. It is notorious that the ague appears on\r\nour eastern coasts with the first east winds of spring; and while\r\nthis circumstance is most common on those of England, as for example,\r\nin Kent, Essex, Norfolk, [p046] Suffolk, and Lincolnshire, it is\r\nnot thus limited, since it is known to happen further north, and\r\neven in Scotland, where malaria is not indigenous to the soil. It\r\nis very true that if we take any inland position in the places thus\r\nnoted, the natural solution is, that the malaria is generated in the\r\nvery soil itself of England, and merely propagated, perhaps even to\r\nvery moderate distances, through those winds. But the occurrence of\r\ndisease cannot be explained thus, when the place in question is so\r\nsituated that there is no land to the eastward, or when the breeze\r\nis, most literally and rigidly, a sea breeze; while, when ague thus\r\noccurs on the east coast of Scotland, where it is not produced by the\r\nsoil, it must be imported by the east wind.\r\n\r\nThese are the facts; while as malaria is not produced by the sea\r\nitself in any known circumstance, though a vegetating sea beach\r\nmay give rise to it, we must seek the cause in lands far distant,\r\nand consider this as a case of propagation of the poison from the\r\nshores of Holland; and those shores are unquestionably competent to\r\nthat effect: so that the only question that remains, the fact being\r\nadmitted, is, whether, _à priori_, or theoretically, such a view is\r\nprobable, or whether it is consistent with those physical principles\r\nthat are concerned in the propagation of malaria.\r\n\r\nI am aware that such a view will excite the incredulity of those\r\nwho have not attended to this subject; though it appears to me that\r\nit comprises nothing averse to our knowledge of the philosophical\r\ncircumstances concerned. In the first place, let us remark that the\r\neast wind, and particularly the east winds of spring, are notorious\r\nfor their moisture, and that a moist air is the best conductor of\r\nmalaria, as moisture in the air, under the form of evening mists, or\r\nin other modes, appears even to be its proper vehicle, or residence,\r\nif I may use such a term; and though I have not as yet separated\r\nthe case of a fog, I may now remark, that the effect in question,\r\nor the production of agues by fogs arriving from the sea, is even\r\nmore notorious than their generation by an ordinary clear wind. So\r\nnotorious and popular, indeed, is this fact, that the fog itself is\r\ndeemed the source of the disease, as the east wind under any form is,\r\nin other circumstances; while I hope it will even now appear, [p047]\r\nthat the real cause lies in the malaria transported or conveyed\r\nby those winds or fogs, and of which they are the true and best\r\nrepository and vehicle.\r\n\r\nAnd these are the reasons for thinking that the malaria, with the\r\nwind, may be transported to a distance as great as that which the\r\npresent view requires; most easily perhaps in a fog, but without\r\ndifficulty even in a clear wind. It is remarkable that the east wind,\r\nas it is the most persevering, is that one also which preserves the\r\nmost steady horizontal and linear course. I have also shown, in a\r\nformer work, that it is a property of winds to travel in distinct\r\nlines through a tranquil atmosphere, and often in streams of a very\r\nlimited breadth; that opposing streams will also move, in absolute\r\ncontact; and that even rapid streams of wind will cross each other’s\r\ncourses without difficulty. This proves that, in any such stream,\r\nthere is a principle of self-preservation or integrity, and renders\r\nit probable that the several portions retain the same relative places\r\nto each other, at any distance, during the career of the whole; and\r\nthere is a proof of this afforded in the fact of those columns or\r\nstreams of insects which are brought over by such winds, and very\r\nfrequently from those very countries, or from Holland and Flanders,\r\nin the most regular order, or without disturbance or dispersion.\r\n\r\nHence it may be argued, that if a malaria, generated any where\r\nand conveyed by the winds, can be transported to a distance of\r\nthree miles, as has been proved, there is no reason why it should\r\nnot travel much farther, or to any distance that can be assumed:\r\nand if this be true of a clear wind, the case of a fog is even a\r\nmuch stronger one; since there is little reason to doubt that the\r\nindividual parts of such fog, in any assumed mass, will retain their\r\nrelative places to each other, as perfectly after a journey of any\r\ngiven number of miles, as they did at the point of production; and\r\nif a portion of malaria has been united to a portion of fog, in the\r\nmarsh which produced both, or whence both have come, there is every\r\napparent reason why it should be found in that same portion at any\r\nfarther or assumed distance, because there is no cause for either its\r\ndispersion or its decomposition.\r\n\r\nA fog is a cloud, simply; and it is notorious that a single [p048]\r\ncloud, and often of very small dimensions, will remain at rest\r\nin the atmosphere, or travel very many miles without the loss of\r\nits integrity; however we may imagine it assailed by the various\r\nmeteorological causes of destruction, as well as by mechanical\r\nviolence. This in itself proves the consistency with which a current\r\nof wind preserves the relative positions of its integral parts;\r\nbecause it is plain that a disturbance among these must disturb or\r\ndestroy the cloud which, in reality, forms a portion of that current,\r\nas a gaseous body: and since that cloud is a mist, since it might\r\nhave been the very evening mist embodying a malaria, and since it\r\nis its real vehicle and repository, it is plain that had it, or\r\nany individual cloud, contained such a portion of malaria, it must\r\nhave had the power of transmitting that, and would actually have\r\ntransported it to any distance to which itself might travel. Thus, it\r\nis evident, may a fog, generated in Holland, carry without difficulty\r\nto the limits of its range, or to the coast of England, that malaria\r\nwhich became entangled with it at its birth-place or in its passage;\r\nand thus, I have little doubt, is the fact of those agues explained,\r\nand this transportation to such distances established.\r\n\r\nI cannot, at least, conceive any demonstration as to facts of this\r\nnature more convincing, nor anything wanting to the proof; while\r\nI may proceed to make some remarks on the east wind, and on fogs,\r\nsimply, because they concern this question.\r\n\r\nThe proof that it is a malaria in the fog, and not the fog itself,\r\nwhich is the cause of disease, is evinced by the following fact;\r\nwhile it ought surely to be unnecessary to say, that if fog alone\r\ncould produce such fever, water itself must be the poison: since a\r\nfog is a cloud, and its constituents, when pure, are only atmospheric\r\nair and water. No intermittents are ever produced on the western or\r\nnorthern shores by the sea fogs, and for the plain reason, that there\r\nis no land whence they arrive. The clouds of mountainous regions\r\ndo not produce fevers, though these also are fogs; and what forms\r\na most absolute proof of this is, that in Flanders, it is the fogs\r\nwhich come with a southwest wind, or the southerly winds themselves,\r\nwhich transport and propagate malaria and disease; while; as soon as\r\nthe winds shift, and blow from the sea, the fevers [p049] disappear,\r\nthough those particular winds are so charged with fog, as to darken\r\nthe whole country for days: and it will be found an invariable rule\r\nall over the world, that when a fog is the apparent cause of disease,\r\nor when an east wind is such, it is because these have been generated\r\nin a land of marshes, or have traversed one; and that, under other\r\ncircumstances, or where no pernicious land lies in the way, they are\r\nas innocent as any other fogs and winds, and that the hazard and the\r\nsuffering will arise from those, be they whatever they may, which\r\ntraverse pestilential lands.\r\n\r\nBut I must defer this particular and interesting subject to another\r\noccasion, lest I make this article too long; and proceed to examine\r\nsome other circumstances connected with the transportation of malaria.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, I must notice one fact as to this transportation from\r\nHolland, partly because it is a necessary fact in the history of\r\nmalaria, and partly because it might be used as an argument against\r\nthe view which I have just given. The east winds of autumn are not\r\nsupposed to bring remittents, as those of spring bring agues, though\r\nI cannot assert that this is absolutely true. Being assumed, the\r\nsolution is easy. If the winds of this nature in spring, are notedly\r\nmoist, and thus vehicles of malaria, the case is exactly the reverse\r\nwith the east winds of summer and autumn; or as the east wind may\r\nbe the most moist of winds, so may it be the most dry; while it is\r\na consequence of its extreme dryness, in fact, that it is always\r\nthe very cause of our burning summers. This is the history of our\r\nlast summers, and it is invariable, whether as it relates to seasons\r\nor single days; and it is plainly owing to its permitting the more\r\nready transmission of the sun’s rays. That it is the very harmattan\r\nof Africa, it is almost unnecessary to say; and as dry wind is not\r\na conductor of malaria, as that poison is in fact decomposed or\r\ndestroyed in these circumstances, daily and invariably, it is easy to\r\nsee why the remittents of Holland should not be transported, like its\r\nintermittents, though even this may possibly happen under particular\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nTo proceed; and to the next remarkable facts connected with the\r\npropagation of malaria.—The most singular of these is its limitation,\r\nor that yet unexplained property by which it is [p050] determined in\r\na particular direction, or confined to a particular spot, while it is\r\na piece of knowledge of some practical value. There is an appearance\r\nof incredibility about many of these facts, and, accordingly, they\r\nhave not only been disbelieved but ridiculed, although nothing in the\r\nwhole history of this substance is better established.\r\n\r\nWith respect to direction, in the first place, it is remarked in\r\nItaly, currently, that this poison will enter the lower stories of\r\nhouses, particularly with open windows, when the next above escape;\r\nand hence, in many places, no one ventures to sleep on ground floors:\r\nand the truth of this was confirmed in the barracks at Jamaica by Dr.\r\nHunter; as the cases of fever occurring among the men in the lower\r\nrooms much exceeded those which happened in the upper ones. But I\r\nam also informed, that in some places in Norfolk this peculiarity\r\nis reversed; or that there are houses where it is remarked that the\r\nground-floors are safe, while no one can sleep in the upper stories\r\nwithout hazard.\r\n\r\nThat malaria may in some manner be attached to the soil is also well\r\nknown by its effects, and especially in Italy. There it is remarked\r\nthat it is extremely hazardous to cut down certain bushy plants which\r\nappear to entangle it, and that fevers are a frequent consequence of\r\nsuch carelessness. Thus, also, does fever seize on the labourers who\r\nmay incautiously sit down on the ground, while they would escape in\r\nthe erect posture; being thus, indeed, sometimes suddenly struck with\r\napoplexy, which is one of the effects of this poison, or even with\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt has similarly been observed that it is often retained in the\r\nshelter of drains, or in the ditches of fortifications; whence\r\nfrequent fevers among the sentries on particular guards, when the\r\nother soldiers escape. And thus was it even proved at Malta, that it\r\nwas transported from the sea-shore, and thus lodged in a dry ditch of\r\nthe works at Valetta; all these facts being possibly to be explained,\r\nby supposing it possessed of a greater specific gravity than the\r\natmosphere, or else attached to vapour thus weighty, exhibiting\r\neffects analogous to those which carbonic acid displays in the\r\nSolfatara.\r\n\r\nBut the circumstance most difficult of explanation is, that in\r\nRome, and numerous places in Italy, and even where it is [p051]\r\ntransported from a distance by the winds, not generated on the spot,\r\nit is found, perennially, and through the whole course of successive\r\nyears, to occupy certain places, and to avoid, as constantly, others\r\nquite near, and, as far as the eye can judge, equally exposed, and\r\nin all respects similar. Thus, one side of a small garden, one side\r\nof a street, or one house, will be for ever exposed to disease, or\r\nuninhabitable, when, at a few feet or yards distant, the very same\r\nplaces are as constantly free of danger: and thus it was found at the\r\nvillage of Faro, in Sicily, that all the troops of our army quartered\r\non one side of the single street which formed it, were affected\r\nby fevers, and suffered great mortality, while those on the other\r\nremained in health.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable case of this nature known to me, is a\r\ndomestic one, and which rests on the testimony of thousands of\r\npersons, or of the whole country, however incredible it may appear.\r\nIt is, that between Chatham and Brighton, including every town and\r\nsingle house, and Sittingbourne among the rest, the ague affects the\r\nleft hand side of the turnpike road, or the northern side, and does\r\nnot touch the right side, though the road itself forms the only line\r\nof separation.\r\n\r\nWe cannot as yet conjecture the cause of this very singular\r\ncircumstance or property, at least in cases of this nature;\r\nthough, under certain events of this kind, there are some facts\r\nin meteorology that may offer a solution. These are the notorious\r\nones, that a hoar frost, or a dew, will sometimes be found most\r\naccurately limited, both vertically and horizontally, by a definite\r\nline; stopping, for example, at a particular hedge, and reaching to a\r\ncertain altitude on a tree: but for the other cases, we must yet wait\r\nfor a period of more accurate knowledge as to this singular substance.\r\n\r\nThere is now one circumstance of importance, relating to the\r\ndestruction or decomposition of malaria, which must not be passed\r\nover, from the interest of the facts depending on it: this is,\r\nthat its propagation is checked by the streets of a crowded town,\r\nand apparently owing to this very cause, decomposition. Thus it is\r\nobserved, that the fever never appears in the Judaicum of Rome, and,\r\nsimilarly, that the crowded streets and the poor people escape, when\r\nthe opulent houses and open [p052] streets are attacked; and hence\r\nthe Villa Borghese, among many other palaces and opulent houses\r\nin Rome, has been abandoned, while such desertion, being limited\r\nexclusively to houses where the air is most open and free, naturally\r\nexcites wonder: the cause, however, is now plain; and thus it now\r\nappears why it was that the Penitentiary in Westminster suffered\r\nformerly from dysentery, originating in this cause, when no such\r\ndisease appeared among the neighbouring inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAnd if this fact is of value as it may relate to the erection of open\r\nstreets in any place of this nature, it is most important to point\r\nout what has been the continuous effect at Rome, as the ultimate\r\nconsequences threaten to be extremely serious.\r\n\r\nIt appears that from cutting down some forests which many years ago\r\noccupied the declivities of the hills to the southward of Rome, the\r\nmalaria was let in upon that city from the Pontine marshes; and,\r\nfurther, that the extirpation of a similar wood to the eastward had\r\nlet in the same poison upon another quarter. Thus it has been found\r\nto enter the city through the Porta del Popolo, while, for many\r\nyears past, it has been gradually extending its influence through\r\nthe streets; leading annually and successively to the abandonment of\r\nmany houses and palaces, and still annually increasing and extending\r\nits ravages; so as, at length, as I understand, to have even\r\nbecome sensible at the Vatican. And the lines which it follows are\r\ndistinctly traced out by the inhabitants; while, as I have already\r\nsaid, it is only the houses of the opulent which suffer, further than\r\nas the abandonment of these may also influence the inferior ones in\r\ntheir neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWhatever the original cause may be, and however the direction,\r\nabstractedly, may be regulated by the winds and the forms of the\r\nstreets, or by local and fixed circumstances, it is plain that the\r\nannual extension is the consequence of desertion, and that as the\r\ninhabitants retire from before it, it acquires the means of making\r\na new step and a further progress; because thus they withdraw\r\nthose fires and smoke, or whatever else it be, dependent on human\r\ncrowds, which decomposes and destroys this substance. And hence it\r\nmust follow, that as Rome shall become still further abandoned and\r\ndepopulated, from want of industry, or from political feebleness\r\n[p053] added to this cause, the effects must be expected to increase\r\nin a sort of geometrical ratio; almost leading to the fear that\r\nthe whole city itself may, in time, fall a victim to it, or become\r\nabandoned to the wolves and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nIf I dare not inquire more minutely into the remaining circumstances\r\nconnected with the propagation of malaria, lest I should extend this\r\narticle to an inconvenient length, it is necessary now to offer\r\nsome remarks on prevention, and especially as it relates to this\r\ncircumstance—the propagation of the poison; since the rules for\r\nprevention, as far as this relates to production, may be deduced from\r\nwhat was said in a former paper on this subject, and relate chiefly\r\nto the drainage of lands, and to other practices, more or less\r\nobvious, which a little reflection will, without much difficulty,\r\ndeduce from what was there said.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, in the first place, that as far as the winds are\r\nconcerned, it is by opposing obstacles to their course that we must\r\nattempt to counteract or divert their influence; and that, in this\r\ncase, it is through the use of trees alone that we possess any power.\r\nThus reversely, as in the case just stated, the cutting down of trees\r\nand forests has often been a serious cause of diseases in certain\r\ncountries, by admitting a malaria to particular spots; though it is\r\neasy to see that where any given spot suffers from malaria, through\r\ncondensation or confinement, the clearing away of these would be the\r\nremedy, by attaining a free ventilation. To detail the particular\r\nmodes in which remedies may be applied through this species of aid,\r\nis obviously unnecessary, and not easy, as it must depend on local\r\ncircumstances, differing for each place; but I may remark, as an\r\nexample in illustration of my meaning, that where, as in many of the\r\nnarrow and prolonged valleys of Greece, the sea shore is a marsh,\r\nthe remedy would be to plant a screen of trees beyond it, and thus\r\nto prevent the sea winds from passing into the interior. And thus\r\ndid the ancient Romans compel the planting of trees on the shores\r\nof Latium, to check the current from the Pontine marshes; rendering\r\ngroves sacred, under heavy penalties, and enacting other laws with\r\nthe same intentions.\r\n\r\nWith respect to such temporary precautions in these cases [p054] as\r\nmay concern armies in the field, or in camps, it is plain that they\r\nwill depend on attention to the courses and seasons of the winds;\r\nwhile it would be abundantly easy to accumulate, from the histories\r\nof campaigns, the most fearful examples of mortality produced by\r\nneglect of these and similar precautions, and even down to almost\r\nthe very date at which I am writing: and there can be no hesitation\r\nin saying, that an intimate and accurate knowledge of every thing\r\nwhich concerns the production and propagation of malaria, forms a\r\nmost important branch in that information necessary to a soldier,\r\nand above all to the quarter-master-general’s department and the\r\nmedical staff: while, did I dare to record but a very small portion\r\nof the mortality experienced, not only in our own armies, but in\r\nthose of Europe at large, during even the last war, from ignorance\r\nor neglect on this subject, it would, I believe, be found that it\r\nalmost equalled the mortality produced by the actual collision of\r\nwar itself. Walcheren will not soon be forgotten; if we have ceased\r\nto think of our mortal Havannah expedition; and if a French army at\r\nNaples was diminished by twenty thousand men, out of twenty-four, in\r\nfour days, from this cause; if Orloff lost nearly his entire army in\r\nParos; if Hungary has more than once destroyed ten times the number\r\nof men by fever that it did by the sword,—these are but trifles in\r\nthe mass of reasons for saying, that no subject can well be more\r\nimportant, and no knowledge much more necessary to the commander of\r\nan army.\r\n\r\nSome other points relating to prevention may deserve a few words\r\nof notice, before I pass from this subject; if here, also, I must\r\nbe brief. Not to repeat the cautions founded on what relates to\r\nthe power of evening and morning, it has been asserted that the\r\nuse of a gauze veil will prevent the effect of malaria; and it is\r\nnot improbable that the air accumulated within that, may have the\r\npower of decomposing the poison: it is an opinion, at least, which\r\nis universal among the people in Malta, and very general in Spain\r\nand Portugal. It is also found that fires and smoke are useful, and\r\nespecially on military service; the experiment having been tried on\r\na very large scale by Napoleon before Mantua, and on a smaller one\r\nin Africa, with the most perfect success. With respect to [p055]\r\npersonal precautions, it is universally recommended to use wine and\r\na good diet, and especially never to leave the house in the evening\r\nin situations peculiarly insalubrious, without the previous use of\r\nwine or spirits; whence the universal practice of Holland in this\r\nrespect. Thus, also, narcotics prevent its influence; whence the wide\r\nuse of tobacco, of which the salutary effects appear to be most amply\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nAs to the tropical countries, there is here also one important\r\nremark, which, from the great neglect of the fact, and its ruinous\r\nconsequences, appear particularly to demand a statement in this\r\nplace. It is the universal experience of the inhabitants, that the\r\nattack of malaria, or the production of fevers, is aided by the use\r\nof a full or animal diet; by the use of some particular articles of\r\nfood, such as butter; by excess in eating, generally; and, above all,\r\nby eating in the heat of the day. This is not merely well known to\r\nthe negroes, but the fact is distinctly stated to travellers, and the\r\ncaution urged, however often it has been neglected, and especially\r\nby our own countrymen. Of this, in particular, Major Denham is a\r\nstrong testimony; while he attributes his own exclusive preservation\r\nto his having rigidly followed the recommendations of the natives,\r\nwhich were always urged with the greatest earnestness. And if we\r\nexamine the causes of death, in most cases, of our African travellers\r\nespecially, I think there will be strong reasons for believing that\r\ntheir lives have often been sacrificed to this very negligence\r\nor obstinacy; while it is most evident that Niebuhr’s party, in\r\nparticular, owed the loss of their lives to what may be safely called\r\ngluttony: and it is to be suspected that this will also explain the\r\nloss of Captain Tuckey’s party; while, with respect to nations, it\r\nhas long been known that the English, the Dutch, and the northern\r\nvoracious people in general, who habitually indulge themselves in the\r\ncustoms of their original country as tropical colonists, have always\r\nbeen greater sufferers from the effects of those climates than the\r\nFrench and the Spaniards, and apparently from this very difference.\r\nAnd there seems little doubt, generally, that the vegetable diet of\r\nAfrica and Hindostan is the best security against the evil influence\r\nof those climates, and that the chief sufferings of our [p056] own\r\ncolonists arise from transferring to those situations their ancient\r\nhabits of full and free living.\r\n\r\nAs I must not prolong this subject much further, I shall now pass to\r\na few remarks, but very brief ones, on the geography of malaria as\r\nit relates to those parts of the continent of Europe most frequented\r\nby English travellers; not daring to take room for actual and\r\nuseful information on that head, but wishing to point out merely\r\nthe importance of such geographical knowledge to those persons, on\r\naccount of the hazards which they so universally incur from that\r\nignorance or neglect, and of the great mass of suffering, and also\r\nof mortality, which has been the lot of persons who had resorted to\r\nthose climates as travellers, or migrating residents, from various\r\nmotives, and not unfrequently with views to health. How often health\r\nhas been lost where it was sought, will be but too apparent to any\r\none who has chanced to possess an extensive acquaintance of this\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nOf Italy I can but afford to say generally, that except at a very\r\nfew points where the Alps or Apennines reach the sea, the whole of\r\nits shores are pestilential, and often to such a degree as to lead\r\nto their entire desertion, more frequently to their abandonment\r\nin summer. And to avoid wet lands, or low lands, is not always a\r\nsufficient precaution; since the most pestilential parts of the\r\nmaremma of Tuscany are dry, and since the annual mortality of Sienna\r\nfrom fevers, even without epidemics, is one in ten. In the north of\r\nItaly, the great plain is similarly insalubrious; though the more\r\nunhealthy district does not commence until we arrive at Mantua,\r\nextending thence to the sea. Of the Mediterranean islands, I can\r\nonly afford room to say, that the same rule holds good as to the\r\nsea coasts, while the entire of Greece in the same circumstances\r\nis similarly unhealthy, and subject to autumnal fevers in as great\r\na degree as the worst parts of Italy. The same is true of Spain\r\nand Portugal, and the same rule also will be a guide; namely, that\r\nmalaria is to be expected in all the flat grounds, even when under\r\ncultivation, and at all the exits of rivers on the sea, even though\r\nno marshes should be present: and if I were desirous to name any\r\ntract of land in Spain peculiarly [p057] insalubrious, it would be\r\nthe province of Valencia; while Carthagena is almost invariably fatal\r\neven to those who, as labourers, are compelled to resort to it for\r\nthe needful work of its port, even during a few days.\r\n\r\nOf France, little as it has hitherto been suspected by those who,\r\nassociating the term malaria with Italy, have been accustomed to\r\nconsider it as peculiar to that country, it would scarcely be untrue\r\nto say that it contains as large a portion of insalubrious territory\r\nas Italy itself, and produces fever and disease of as great severity\r\nand extent, not merely on its sea coasts, but over very extensive\r\ntracts in its interior. And this insalubrity may be conjectured,\r\nwhen there are entire districts in which the average of life does\r\nnot exceed twenty, and in which the entire people are diseased from\r\ntheir births to their graves. Such tracts are found chiefly on the\r\ncourse of the Loire, and some other of the great rivers; and among\r\nthem, Bresse in the Lyonnais, the plain of Forez, and Sologne in the\r\nOrleannais, are of the most notorious; while the coasts of Normandy,\r\nand the whole of low Britanny, are similarly subject to eternal\r\nintermittents, or to epidemic seasons of autumnal fevers, amounting\r\nto absolute pestilences. And how English families have suffered in\r\nthis country from the incautious choice of residences in such places,\r\nwill be easily ascertained by whoever shall be at the trouble of\r\nmaking the necessary inquiries.\r\n\r\nBut as I dare not pursue this extensive subject, I can only suggest\r\nto our countrymen the utility of making themselves acquainted with\r\nthis matter, and with this dangerous geography, before encountering\r\nthe hazards which await them; while to physicians I need still less\r\nname the necessity of that knowledge, since it is so often their\r\nduty to choose and recommend for their patients, and since no man\r\ncan feel much at his ease who finds that he has sent into a land of\r\nmalaria the patient who has already been suffering from its diseases,\r\nor that where he speculates on the cure of a consumption, that\r\ncure is attained through the death of the patient, at Avignon, or\r\nat Poitiers, or Nantes, or in some or other of the numerous places\r\nsubject to this most fearful poison.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to give a brief enumeration of the diseases [p058]\r\nwhich are the produce of malaria, and of the general condition of\r\nthe inhabitants in the countries subject to it. With respect to this\r\nlatter, the most remarkable general fact is the contracted duration\r\nof life. In England, the average may, if not very accurately, and\r\nindeed considerably under the mark, be taken at 50; and when in\r\nHolland it is but 25, it follows that the half of human life is\r\nat once cut off by this destructive agent. In the parts of France\r\nto which I have alluded, it becomes as low as 22 and 20, and\r\nCondorcet, indeed, has calculated it as low as 18. With this, very\r\nfew attain the age of 50; and in appearance and strength, this\r\nterm is equivalent to 80 in ordinary climates; while 40 forms the\r\ngeneral limit of extreme and rare old age. The period of age, indeed,\r\ncommences after 20; and it is remarked, in particular, that the\r\nfemales become old in appearance immediately after 17, and have, even\r\nat 20, the aspect of old women. In many places, even the children are\r\ndiseased from their birth; while the life which is dragged on by the\r\nwhole population, is a life of perpetual disease, and most frequently\r\nof inveterate and incurable intermittents, or of a constant febrile\r\nstate, with debility, affections of the stomach, dropsy, and far more\r\nthan I need here enumerate.\r\n\r\nWhile the countenances of the people in those countries are sallow\r\nor yellow, and often livid, they are frequently so emaciated as\r\nto appear like walking spectres, though the abdomen is generally\r\nenlarged, in consequence either of visceral affections or dropsy.\r\nWith these, rickets, varices, hernia, and, in females, chlorosis,\r\ntogether with scorbutic diseases, ulcers, and so forth, are common;\r\nand it is even to be suspected that the cretinage may depend on this\r\ncause, since goitre is also one of the results of malaria, and since,\r\nin the Maremma of Tuscany, idiotism is a noted consequence of this\r\npestilential influence.\r\n\r\nThe general mental condition is no less remarkable; since it consists\r\nin an universal apathy, recklessness, indolence, and melancholy,\r\nadded to a fatalism which prevents them from even desiring to better\r\ntheir condition, or to avoid such portion of the evils around them\r\nas care and attention might diminish: and while it is asserted that\r\neven the moral character becomes [p059] similarly depraved, I prefer\r\na reference to Montfalcon for a picture which it would not be very\r\nagreeable to transcribe.\r\n\r\nAs to the absolute or positive diseases, besides those which I have\r\nalready named, I need scarcely say that remittent and intermittent\r\nfevers, under endless varieties and types, form the great mass; and\r\nnext in order to them, may be placed dysentery and cholera, together\r\nwith diarrhœa. To these I must also add, those painful diseases of\r\nthe nerves, of which sciatica stands foremost, and the remainder of\r\nwhich may be ranked under the general term of neuralgia; and further,\r\na considerable number of inflammatory diseases of a more or less\r\nremittent type, among which rheumatism under various forms is the\r\nmost general, and the intermittent ophthalmia the most remarkable.\r\nLastly, I must include the various paralytic affections; since\r\napoplexy is one of the primary and direct consequences of malaria, as\r\nvarious paralytic affections are the produce of intermittent, or the\r\nconsequences of the diseases of the nerves which are associated with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is still a curious and interesting fact, that this poison affects,\r\nin an analogous manner, many different animals, and appears, in\r\nreality, to be the cause of all the noted endemics and remarkable\r\nepidemics which occur in the agricultural animals in particular.\r\nThis has been noticed even by Livy: and in France and Italy it is\r\nequally familiar that the severe seasons of fever among the people\r\nare similarly seasons of epidemics to black-cattle and sheep,\r\nwhile the symptoms are as nearly the same as they could be in the\r\ncircumstances, and the appearances on dissection also correspond.\r\nThus also does it appear probable, that the rot in sheep is actually\r\nthe produce of malaria, as is indeed the received opinion among\r\nFrench veterinarians; while Mr. Royston has observed that the animals\r\nof this class are subject to distinct intermittents.\r\n\r\nAnd while it is not less familiar in the West Indies, and in Dominica\r\nparticularly, that dogs suffer from a mortal fever in the same\r\nseasons and periods as the people, the epidemic always breaking out\r\nin them first, I have the most unexceptionable medical evidence of\r\nthe occurrence of a regular and well-marked tertian in a dog; that\r\nevidence consisting in the concurring decision of many surgeons, by\r\nwhom the case was [p060] frequently examined, during a very long\r\nperiod. But it is time to terminate a paper, which, if it is but a\r\nsketch of an important subject, will at least convey to those to\r\nwhom malaria has not hitherto been an object of attention, a general\r\nnotion of the leading particulars which appertain to its natural\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n J. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Elements of Chemistry, including the recent Discoveries and\r\n Doctrines of the Science. By_ Edward Turner, M.D., F.R.S.E., &c.,\r\n &c. _Edinburgh_, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a closely-printed octavo of 700 pages, and presents us with\r\nsomething more original, clear, and accurate than we have lately met\r\nwith in modern chemistry. It comprehends a perspicuous view of the\r\npresent state of chemical science; and, as far as its limits admit,\r\nthe theoretical parts are, with some exceptions, well and distinctly\r\nworked out; nor are the practical details of manipulation neglected,\r\nthough they evidently occupy a secondary place in our author’s\r\nestimation. To the arrangement we must at once decidedly object—it is\r\nindeed evident that Dr. Turner has pitched upon Dr. Thomas Thomson\r\nas his _magnus Apollo_, and here and elsewhere the book is tainted\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThis work is divided into four principal parts;—the first relates\r\nto what Dr. Turner, following his prototype, Dr. Thomson, calls\r\n_imponderables_, and a definition of them follows, which leads\r\nus to suggest the term _inexpressibles_, as equally appropriate.\r\nBut, waiving this objection, the details relating to them are well\r\nand clearly given. Thus, after some prefatory remarks upon the\r\nsubject of caloric or heat, (we prefer the latter term, and cannot\r\nallow its ambiguity,) its modes of communication are considered,\r\nfirst, as being _conducted_ through bodies, and then as _radiating_\r\nthrough free space. In regard to the theories affecting the\r\nlatter, our author wisely, as we think, prefers that of Prevost\r\nto that of Pictet. The _effects_ of heat are next discussed, such\r\nas _expansion_, including an account of the thermometer, and\r\nof the relative capacities of bodies for heat; _liquefaction_,\r\n_vaporisation_, _ebullition_, _evaporation_, and the _constitution of\r\ngases_ and lastly, the sources of heat are mentioned, but the details\r\nare referred to other parts of the work. [p061]\r\n\r\n_Light_ is next treated of, but we think too hastily, and too much in\r\nthe abstract.\r\n\r\nNow the subjects of heat and light are obviously of the utmost\r\nimportance to the chemical philosopher, and they are very extensive,\r\nand intricate and difficult to treat of, inasmuch as the writer is\r\nnecessarily upon the confines of chemical and mechanical philosophy,\r\nand should be expert in both. When, therefore, elementary works on\r\nchemistry are so written and arranged as to serve as text-books for\r\nlectures, and indexes of reference to more accurate information, we\r\ncan make due allowance for brevity; but when the subject is intended\r\nto be formally and completely developed to the student, independent\r\nof other ocular and oral aids, much more extensive description and\r\ndetailed explanation is required, than is to be found either in\r\nour author’s “Elements,” or in any other analogous condensation of\r\nchemistry. Dr. Henry understands the requisite mode of conveying\r\ninformation in these cases better than most writers; and when he\r\ntakes pains, and speaks for himself, has the talent of being brief,\r\nand at the same time minute, deep, and clear. Dr. Ure, as his\r\ndictionary shows, is an eminent example of such a writer—_he_ of\r\ncourse is neglected, where, as with our author, Dr. Thomson is in the\r\nascendant; but the article caloric, in his dictionary, will at once\r\nexplain and illustrate our meaning, and would furnish an admirable\r\nfoundation for a detailed essay or treatise upon the subject. So\r\nextensive, indeed, are the precincts of chemistry now becoming, that\r\neither our _systems_ must become very voluminous, or we must adopt\r\nthe plan, which to us appears preferable, of distinct treatises upon\r\ndifferent branches of the science. Thus, a separate work on heat and\r\nlight; another on electricity and magnetism; another on attraction\r\nand the theory of combination; a fourth on the constitution and\r\nproperties of the unmetallic elementary bodies; a fifth on the metals\r\nand their compounds; a sixth on vegetable, and a seventh on animal\r\nchemistry and physiology; an eighth on the chemistry of the arts;\r\nand lastly, a treatise on chemical manipulation in general, would\r\ninclude all that appears essentially requisite; and as no one is\r\nsupposed to be equally well versed in all branches of the science, or\r\nin all details of the art, an opportunity of selection would thus be\r\nafforded, so that each writer might choose that particular department\r\nwhich he is most accurately acquainted with, or which has formed\r\nhis favourite study. Mr. Faraday has already, as may be said, led\r\nthe way in such a plan, by the publication of his _Chemical [p062]\r\nManipulation_, a work hitherto exceedingly wanted in the laboratory,\r\nequally useful to the proficient and to the student, and eminently\r\ncreditable to the industry and skill of the author, and to the school\r\nwhence it emanates. We shall of course take an early opportunity of\r\nintroducing this book in a more formal way to the attention of our\r\nchemical readers.\r\n\r\nIn looking over Dr. Turner’s first and second sections on caloric and\r\nlight, in the _Elements_ now before us, we find little but brevity\r\nto complain of;—there are, however, one or two trifling historical\r\ninaccuracies: thus, at page 14, the discovery of _invisible_ heating\r\nrays is ascribed to Saussure and Pictet; but it is, in fact, of much\r\nmore remote origin—it was well known to the Florentine academicians,\r\nand we may even trace the idea in Lucretius, (_De Rerum Naturâ_, lib,\r\nv. 1, 609.)\r\n\r\n Forsitan et rosea Sol alte lampade lucens\r\n Possideat multum _cæcis fervoribus ignem_\r\n Circum se, _nullo qui sit fulgore notatus, &c._\r\n\r\nAt page 31 we have an account of Wedgwood’s pyrometer, which is said\r\nto be “little employed at present, because its indications cannot be\r\nrelied on;”—the fact is, that it is never used, and that we owe to\r\nSir James Hall ample reasons for placing no confidence in it.\r\n\r\nThe subject of _specific heat_ is clearly explained, and so are\r\nthe phenomena of liquefaction and evaporation. In regard to the\r\nconstitution of gases, the author remarks, that the experiments\r\nof Sir H. Davy and Mr. Faraday on the liquefaction of gaseous\r\nsubstances, appear to justify the opinion that gases are merely the\r\nvapours of extremely volatile liquids. Mr. Faraday has proved this\r\nin regard to several of the gases, and analogy leads us to apply it\r\nto the rest;—but what share Sir H. Davy had in the discovery, we\r\nknow not; for Mr. Faraday actually condensed chlorine into a liquid\r\nbefore Sir H. had heard or thought about the matter. _Light_, and\r\nits phenomena as connected with chemistry, is superficially passed\r\nover in the second section, and the third brings us to the important\r\narticle “Electricity.”\r\n\r\nWe are willing to admit that the subject of electricity is a very\r\ndifficult one for the chemist to deal with—he must necessarily say\r\nmuch upon it, and is equally obliged to omit abstract details which\r\nare often necessary to its explanation, and yet too prolix and bulky\r\nfor an elementary chemical work. So that it requires considerable\r\nacquaintance with the subject to give a perspicuous and yet concise\r\nabstract, [p063] such as may be useful to the student. Dr. Turner\r\nhas not been very successful in effecting this _desideratum_, and\r\nhas unnecessarily introduced two sections, the one on electricity,\r\nthe other on galvanism. He also talks of the “science of galvanism,”\r\nwhich is in bad taste, and erroneously asserts that the energy of the\r\npile is proportional to the degree of chemical action which takes\r\nplace; a statement by no means correct, inasmuch as the energy of De\r\nLuc’s column is directly proportional to the number of alternations,\r\nand appears entirely independent of chemical action; and again, a\r\nseries of 2000 plates, arranged in the usual Voltaic apparatus, when\r\nperfectly bright and clean, and the cells filled with distilled water\r\nonly, give a much more powerful shock, and cause a greater divergence\r\nof the leaves of the electrometer than when the apparatus is charged\r\nwith diluted acids. Here, those very singular phenomena, which\r\nelectricians distinguish by the terms _quantity_ and _intensity_,\r\nappear perfectly distinct; and between these our author does not\r\nsufficiently discriminate, but jumbles the whole under the term\r\n_activity_. In describing the chemical energies, too, of the pile, or\r\nits decomposing powers, the Doctor entirely overlooks the important\r\nand curious influence of water. He says that acids and salts are all\r\ndecomposed, without exception, one of their elements appearing at one\r\nside of the battery, and the other at its opposite extremity; (_i.\r\ne._ we presume, at its positive and negative poles.) But the fact is,\r\nthat, excepting where it merely acts as a source of heat, nothing\r\nis decomposable by electricity without the intervention of water;\r\nthe hydrogen and oxygen of which respectively accompany the elements\r\nof the other compounds. Not an atom of potassium can be obtained\r\nunless the potassa be moistened; nor can any salt be decomposed\r\nexcept water be present. Sir Humphry says, it is required, to render\r\nthe substance a conductor; but its operation is more recondite, and\r\nthere is something mysterious and still unexplained in the uniform\r\nappearance of hydrogen and oxygen at the opposite poles, when far\r\napart in water, and in all other cases of true polar electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition. At page 86, the unfortunate protectors of ships’\r\nbottoms are introduced—a subject about which the less is said the\r\nbetter;—and, as to electro-magnetism, it is merely mentioned as to\r\nits leading phenomena, in the space of three or four pages; nor\r\nis anything new suggested upon the “Theory of the Pile,” as it is\r\ncalled, which concludes the subject, and which is dismissed in the\r\nbrief limit of a page and a half. [p064]\r\n\r\nThe second part of Dr. Turner’s work is said to comprise “Inorganic\r\nChemistry,” and therefore embraces a very extensive field of inquiry.\r\nTo the _arrangement_ we have already objected; and many of the\r\ntypographical and verbal errors that occur, have been noticed in a\r\ncontemporary Journal, so that we shall chiefly attend to the details\r\nof the sections.\r\n\r\nUnder the head, “Affinity,” some of the leading facts and doctrines\r\nof chemical attraction are perspicuously set forth; but we could have\r\nwished that a variety of exploded opinions and erroneous notions had\r\nbeen altogether passed over, as they occupy space which might have\r\nbeen better employed, and can never prove of any other use to the\r\nstudent than to show him the errors and fallacies to which acute\r\nphilosophers are sometimes liable. Of this kind, especially, are\r\nBerthollet’s notions upon the subject of affinity. The doctrine of\r\ndefinite proportion is, on the whole, well and clearly explained; but\r\nit would have been much better and clearer, had Dr. Turner confined\r\nhimself to facts, and meddled less with opinions concerning their\r\ncause; he is moreover, in many respects, historically inaccurate. He\r\nascribes much to Dalton that honestly belongs to Higgins;—is much\r\ntoo merciful to Berzelius and his CANONS; and lenient beyond all\r\nendurance to the plagiarisms of “Dr. Thomson’s admirable Treatise on\r\nthe first Principles of Chemistry.”\r\n\r\nIn the third and following sections, the simple non-metallic\r\nsubstances are described in an order of arrangement which must be\r\nvery perplexing to the student; otherwise the details are well\r\ngiven, except that here and there the line between theory and fact\r\nis not sufficiently marked. Thus we are told that “hydrogen is\r\nexactly 16 times lighter than oxygen, and _therefore_ that 100 cubic\r\ninches _must_ weigh 33.888/16, or 2.118. Its specific gravity is\r\nconsequently 0.0694, as stated some years ago by Dr. Prout.” Now this\r\nis a theoretical deduction, founded upon the specific gravity and\r\nconstitution of ammonia, (and not upon the composition of water,) and\r\nprobably correct as applied to _pure_ hydrogen;—but if we weigh the\r\ngas, as usually obtained, even with the utmost caution, and of the\r\nutmost purity, we shall never procure it so light as here stated,\r\nnotwithstanding all the learning and argument that our worthy friend,\r\nDr. Thomas Thomson, has issued upon the subject in his various\r\nessays in the Annals, and in his _magnum opus_. We also object to\r\nthe stress which is often laid upon the whims of individuals, and\r\nupon [p065] exploded opinions; instances of which will occur to the\r\nreader under the subject of the composition of nitrogen, and the\r\nconstitution of the atmosphere. We further caution our author against\r\nadmitting hints, allusions, and inuendos as to the possibility of\r\nfuture inventions and discoveries, as claims upon the merits of such\r\ndiscoveries, when they are actually made. Berzelius has talked a vast\r\ndeal of nonsense about the composition of nitrogen; and should that\r\ndiscovery ever be made, he will doubtlessly assume the credit of\r\nhaving suggested the steps which led to it. Some foolish persons are\r\napt to think that the Marquis of Worcester was the inventor of Watt’s\r\nsteam-engine, because he said he had means of raising water by steam,\r\nin his _Century of Inventions_; and we have heard that an eminent\r\nchemist of the present day considers himself entitled to all the\r\nmerit that may belong to Mr. Brunel’s carbonic acid engine, because\r\nhe had previously stated the possibility of such an application of\r\nMr. Faraday’s important discoveries. The fact is, that these are\r\nwoeful days for science; all the good feeling and free communication\r\nthat used to exist among its active cultivators in this country, has\r\ngiven way to petty jealousies and quibbling scandal; one person is\r\nexalted for the purpose of depreciating another; and those causes of\r\ndisgust, which some years ago induced one of our most amiable and\r\nable men of science to quit the field, and even leave the country,\r\nare becoming daily more prevalent. Were it not an invidious task, we\r\ncould easily explain and unfold the sources of all this mischief, and\r\nshall indeed feel it our duty so to do, should not matters in due\r\ntime take a more favourable turn; but the task is at once serious\r\nand disagreeable, and we therefore postpone it, in the hope of more\r\nfavourable events. We really believe that, had it not been for the\r\nscientific conversationes held during the last season at the houses\r\nof a few private gentlemen connected with the learned societies,\r\nand more especially the weekly meetings at the Royal Institution,\r\nwhich kept up a friendly intercourse among those who were willing\r\nto profit by it, that the whole scientific world would have been at\r\nloggerheads, and in that state of anarchy of which the evils may be\r\nlearned by a short residence at a “northern seat of learning.”\r\n\r\nThe main object of this digression is to deprecate _party_ in\r\nscience; and we were led to it by observing, or thinking that we\r\nobserve, something of such a tendency in the writer whose book is\r\nbefore us—we hope we are mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe next section comprises “the compounds of the simple [p066]\r\nnon-metallic acidifiable combustibles with each other.” It includes\r\nthe important subject of ammonia, of the varieties of carburetted\r\nhydrogen, sulphuretted and phosphuretted hydrogen, and cyanogen\r\nand its compounds. The metals are then treated of, and to these\r\nsucceed their salts; and though the execution of this part of the\r\nwork betrays some haste, it shows also considerable reading, and\r\nsome originality: the general views are well and clearly sketched,\r\nbut there are many points upon which we are entirely at variance\r\nwith our author; and we more especially object to his account of the\r\naction of chlorides upon water, and to his notions concerning the\r\n“muriates of oxides,” a class of compounds of which, with one or two\r\nexceptions, we are disinclined to admit the existence. If common\r\nsalt be a _chloride_ of _sodium_, and experiment obliges us so to\r\nregard it, what is there in its aqueous solution that should lead us\r\nto consider it as containing a _muriate_ of _soda_; what evidence of\r\nany new arrangement of elements? Dr. T. is certainly in mistake, when\r\nhe says, “for all practical purposes, therefore, the solution of a\r\nmetallic chloride in water may be viewed as the muriate of an oxide,\r\nand on this account I shall always regard it as such in the present\r\ntreatise.” This inconsiderate dogma taints much of the reasoning\r\nupon the chlorides, &c., and is manifestly culled in the Thomsonian\r\nschool, though we have indeed heard that a Professor at Edinburgh\r\nthus addresses his pupils upon the above subject: “The elaborate\r\nresearches of the illustrious Davy have taught us that common salt\r\nis a binary compound of chlorine and sodium, a chloride, therefore,\r\nor a chloruret of sodium. But it is only chloride of sodium whilst\r\nquiescent in the salt-cellar; for no sooner does it come into\r\ncontact with the salivary humidity of the fauces, than, by the play\r\nof affinities, which I have elsewhere explained, the sodium becomes\r\nsoda, and the chlorine generates muriatic acid;—that, therefore,\r\nwhich upon the table is chloride of sodium, is muriate of soda in\r\nthe mouth; and this again, when desiccated or deprived of humidity,\r\nretrogrades into its former state.”\r\n\r\nDr. Turner again falls into error, as we humbly conceive, in calling\r\ncertain salts, such, for instance, as those of the peroxide of iron,\r\n_sesquisalts_, a term properly applied in those cases only where one\r\nproportional of a protoxide unites with one and a half of an acid,\r\nsuch for instance as the _sesquicarbonate of soda_, &c., but in the\r\nsesquisulphate of iron, one proportional of the peroxide contains\r\n1.5 of oxygen, and [p067] necessarily, therefore, (according to\r\nBerzelius’ canon, if the Doctor pleases,) requires 1.5 of acid to\r\nconvert it into a salt; just as the commonly constituted peroxides\r\n(containing two proportionals of oxygen) require two of acid. Dr.\r\nThomson, with all his nomenclatural pretensions, has fallen into the\r\nsame error.\r\n\r\nThe part of our author’s work which treats of the chemistry of\r\norganic bodies is, upon the whole, an unexceptionable and accurate\r\nepitome of that complicated branch of the science. It has its\r\ninaccuracies, but they apparently arise out of the difficulty of\r\ncondensing into the space of a few pages, matter which, as we have\r\nelsewhere remarked, would require an ample volume for its extended\r\nand perspicuous details.\r\n\r\nIn our hasty account of this work, we have rather dwelt upon its\r\ndefects than its merits, in the hope of seeing another and more\r\nextended edition, free from what we consider as serious obstacles\r\nto the success and usefulness of the present production. We hope\r\nthat Dr. Turner will not feel offended at the freedom with which\r\nour remarks are offered. We are anxious that a writer of such good\r\ninformation should be induced to think for himself; at least, that\r\nhe should accurately weigh the pretensions, and inquire into the\r\noriginality of those views and researches upon which he bestows such\r\nunqualified and, in our opinion, undeserved praise, and to which he\r\nassents with a facility unbecoming one who evidently possesses the\r\nmeans of testing their merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Experiments on Audition_.\r\n\r\n [Communicated by Mr. C. Wheatstone.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent valuable experiments of Savart[23] and of Dr. Wollaston\r\nhave added to our stock of information several important and\r\nhitherto unnoticed phenomena relating audition; but, notwithstanding\r\nthe investigations of these distinguished experimentalists, and\r\nthough the physiology of the ear has been an object of unceasing\r\nattention for many centuries, yet we are far from possessing a\r\nperfect knowledge of the functions of the various parts of this\r\norgan. The description of new facts illustrative of this subject\r\ncannot, therefore, be devoid of interest; [p068] and though I do not\r\nanticipate that the observations contained in this communication will\r\nlead to any important results, their novelty may claim for them some\r\nattention from the readers of your Journal.\r\n\r\n § 1.\r\n\r\nIf the hand be placed so as to cover the ear, or if the entrance\r\nof the meatus auditorius be closed by the finger without pressure,\r\nthe perception of external sounds will be considerably diminished,\r\nbut the sounds of the voice produced internally will be greatly\r\naugmented: the pronunciation of those vowels in which the cavity of\r\nthe mouth is the most closed, as _e_ _ou_, &c., produce the strongest\r\neffect; on articulating smartly the syllables _te_ and _kew_, the\r\nsound will be painfully loud.\r\n\r\nPlacing the conducting stem of a sounding tuning-fork[24] on any part\r\nof the head, when the ears are closed as above described, a similar\r\naugmentation of sound will be observed. When one ear remains open,\r\nthe sound will always be referred to the closed ear, but when both\r\nears are closed, the sound will appear louder in that ear the nearer\r\nto which it is produced. If, therefore, the tuning-fork be applied\r\nabove the temporal bone near either ear, it will be apparently heard\r\nby that ear to which it is adjacent; but on removing the hand from\r\nthis ear (although the fork remains in the same situation) the sound\r\nwill appear to be referred immediately to the opposite ear.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the vocal articulations, the augmentation is\r\naccompanied by a reedy sound, occasioned by the strong agitations\r\nof the tympanum. When the air in the meatus is compressed against\r\nthis membrane by pressing the hand _close_ to the ear, or when\r\nthe eustachian tube is exhausted by the means indicated by Dr.\r\nWollaston, the reedy sound is no longer heard, and the augmentation\r\nis considerably diminished. The ringing [p069] noise which\r\nsimultaneously accompanies a very intense sound, proceeds from the\r\nsame cause, and may be prevented by the same means. This ringing may\r\nbe produced by applying the stem of a sounding tuning-fork to the\r\nhand when covering the ear, or by whistling when a hearing trumpet\r\nis placed to the ear. As a proof that the resulting augmentation,\r\nwhich, when great, excites the vibrations of the tympanum, is owing\r\nto the reciprocation of the vibrations by the air contained within\r\nthe closed cavity, it may be mentioned, that when the entrance of the\r\nmeatus is closed by a fibrous substance, as wool, &c., no increase is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIf the meatus and the concha of one ear be filled with water, the\r\nsounds above-mentioned will be referred to the cavity containing the\r\nwater in the same way as when it contained air, and was closed by\r\nthe hand; it will be indifferent whether any partition be interposed\r\nbetween the cavity and the external air; as the water is equally well\r\ninsulated by a surface of air as by a solid body.\r\n\r\n § 2.\r\n\r\nThe preceding experiments have shown, that sounds immediately\r\ncommunicated to the closed meatus externus are very greatly\r\naugmented; and it is an obvious inference, that if _external_ sounds\r\ncan be communicated, so as to act on the cavity in a similar manner,\r\nthey must receive a corresponding augmentation. The great intensity\r\nwith which sound is transmitted by solid rods, at the same time that\r\nits diffusion is prevented, affords a ready means of effecting this\r\npurpose, and of constructing an instrument, which, from its rendering\r\naudible the weakest sounds, may with propriety be named a Microphone.\r\n\r\nProcure two flat pieces of plated metal, each sufficiently large\r\nto cover the external ear, to the form also of which they may be\r\nadapted; on the outside of each plate directly opposite the meatus,\r\nrivet a rod of iron or brass wire about 16 inches in length, and\r\none-eighth of an inch in diameter, and fasten the two rods together\r\nat their unfixed extremities, so as to meet in a single point. The\r\nrods must be so curved, that when the plates are applied to the\r\nears, each rod may at one end be perpendicularly inserted into its\r\ncorresponding plate, and at the other end may meet before the head in\r\nthe plane of the mesial [p070] line. The spring of the rods will be\r\nsufficient to fix the plates to the ears, but for greater security\r\nribands may be attached to each rod near its insertion in the plate,\r\nand be tied behind the head.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: untitled, Microphone]\r\n\r\nA more simple instrument may be constructed to be applied to one ear\r\nonly, by inserting a straight rod perpendicularly into a similar\r\nplate to those described above.\r\n\r\nThe Microphone is calculated only for hearing sounds when it is in\r\nimmediate contact with sonorous bodies; when they are diffused by\r\ntheir transmission through the air, this instrument will not afford\r\nthe slightest assistance.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention in this place to detail all the various\r\nexperiments which may be made with this instrument, a few will\r\nsuffice to enable the experimenter to vary them at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n1. If a bell be rung in a vessel of water, and the point of the\r\nmicrophone be placed in the water at different distances from the\r\nbell, the differences of intensity will be very sensible. 2. If\r\nthe point of the microphone be applied to the sides of a vessel\r\ncontaining a boiling liquid, or if it be placed in the liquid itself,\r\nthe various sounds which are rendered may be heard very distinctly.\r\n3. The instrument affords a means of ascertaining, with considerable\r\naccuracy, the points of a sonorous body at which the intensity of\r\nvibration is the greatest or least; thus, placing its point on\r\ndifferent parts of the sounding board of a violin or guitar, whilst\r\none of its strings is in vibration, the points of greatest and least\r\nvibration are easily distinguished. 4. If the stem of a sounding\r\ntuning-fork be brought in contact with any part of the microphone,\r\nand at the same time a musical sound be produced by the voice, the\r\nmost uninitiated ear [p071] will be able to perceive the consonance\r\nor dissonance of the two sounds; the roughness of discords, and the\r\nbeatings of imperfect consonances, are thereby rendered so extremely\r\ndisagreeable, and form so evident a contrast to the agreeable\r\nharmony and smoothness of two perfectly consonant sounds, that it is\r\nimpossible that they can be confounded.\r\n\r\n § 3.\r\n\r\nApply the broad sides of two sounding tuning-forks, both being\r\nunisons, to the same ear; on removing one fork to the opposite ear,\r\nallowing the other to remain, the sensation will be considerably\r\naugmented.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that when two consonant sounds are heard together,\r\na third sound results from the coincidences of their vibrations;\r\nand that this third sound, which is called the grave harmonic, is\r\nalways equal to unity, when the two primitive sounds are represented\r\nby the lowest integral numbers. This being premised, select two\r\ntuning-forks, the sounds of which differ by any consonant interval\r\nexcepting the octave; place the broad sides of their branches, while\r\nin vibration, close to one ear, in such a manner that they shall\r\nnearly touch at the acoustic axis, the resulting grave harmonic will\r\nthen be strongly audible, combined with the two other sounds; place\r\nafterwards one fork to each ear, and the consonance will be heard\r\nmuch richer in volume, but no audible indications whatever of the\r\nthird sound will be perceived.\r\n\r\n § 4.\r\n\r\nVery acute sounds, such as the chirping of the gryllus campestris,\r\n&c., are rendered inaudible by exhausting the air from the Eustachian\r\ntube, and thereby producing a tension of the membrane of the\r\ntympanum; the different thicknesses or tensions of this membrane\r\nmay therefore occasion that diversity of the limits of audibility,\r\nwith regard to the acute sounds which Dr. Wollaston has pointed out\r\nas existing in different individuals; if so, it would be desirable\r\nto ascertain this limit in individuals in whom the tympanum is\r\nperforated, or destroyed.\r\n\r\n § 5.\r\n\r\nWhen the auricula is brought forward, all _acute_ sounds are rendered\r\nmuch more intense, but no sensible difference is [p072] perceived\r\nwith regard to the grave sounds. The _higher_ tones of glass\r\nstaccados, or of an octave flute, the ticking of a watch, all kinds\r\nof sibilant sounds, &c. are thus greatly augmented: the experiment\r\nis easily tried, by whistling very shrill notes. A still greater\r\naugmentation of the acute sounds is obtained, by placing the hands\r\nformed into a concave behind the ears, and by bending downwards the\r\nupper part of the auricula, so as to obtain a more complete cavity.\r\n\r\n § 6.\r\n\r\nI will conclude with the following observation: I had, in consequence\r\nof a cold, a very slight pain in my left ear; on sounding the regular\r\nnotes of the piano-forte, C^3 and C^4 were much louder than the\r\nothers, and the loudness was much increased, by placing the hand\r\nin the manner above described to the left ear. When it was pressed\r\nclose, or when the Eustachian tube was closed, the intensities of\r\nall the notes were equalized. I attribute this affection to the\r\ndiminished tension of the membrana tympani, which was again increased\r\nby the operation described.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [23] Recherches sur les usages de la membrane du tympan et de\r\n l’oreille externe; par M. Felix Savart. _Annales de Chimie_, tom.\r\n xxvi. p. 1.\r\n\r\n [24] The tuning-fork consists of a four-sided metallic rod, bent so\r\n as to form two equal and parallel branches, having a stem connected\r\n with the lower curved part of the rod, and contained within the\r\n plane of the two branches. The branches are caused to vibrate by\r\n striking one end against a hard body, whilst the stem is held in the\r\n hand. The sound produced by this instrument when insulated is very\r\n weak, and can only be distinctly heard when its branches are brought\r\n close to the ear; but instantly its stem is connected with any\r\n surface capable of vibrating, a great augmentation of sound ensues\r\n from the communicated vibrations. The facility of its insulation and\r\n communication renders it a very convenient instrument for a variety\r\n of acoustical experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _On the Petromyzon Marinus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn entering the harbour of Dublin a few weeks ago, we were becalmed\r\noff the Hill of Howth, and to pass the tedious time until a breeze\r\nsprung up, we found some lines on board, and began to fish from the\r\nquarter-deck. We caught a number of grey gurnet; but our attention\r\nwas particularly attracted by a pull of uncommon force on one of\r\nthe lines. Having rendered assistance to the person who held it, we\r\nwere all astonished to see rise out of the water a large fish, with\r\napparently a double body, which, after floundering on the surface\r\nof the water, we pulled on deck. On examining this phenomenon for\r\na short time, we were again surprized to see it separate into two\r\nparts; and then found that there were _two_ large fish taken up on\r\nthe same hook, the head of one having been buried under the throat\r\nof the other, to which it had firmly attached itself. When separated\r\nby force, it wiggled about on the deck with extraordinary strength\r\nand agility, and again darted on its prey, to which [p073] it adhered\r\nso firmly, that it required very considerable exertion to detach\r\nit; for it suffered itself to be raised up by the tail, and shaken,\r\nstill holding the other fish suspended from its jaws. When finally\r\nseparated, it showed great ferocity, darting at every thing near it,\r\nand at last seizing the deck, which it held very fast, writhing with\r\nits tail and body as if in the act of tearing it to pieces. When\r\ndetached, its teeth left a deep circular impression on the wood, the\r\nfibres of which were drawn into the cavity of its jaws, so as to be\r\nraised up in the form of a cone. I now directed, that it should be\r\nput into a bucket of sea water, in the hope of preserving it alive\r\nuntil we arrived in Dublin, but it died in a shorter time than could\r\nbe expected, from the energy and activity it had displayed, long\r\nafter the other fish was dead. We had handled it very roughly, and so\r\nperhaps had mortally hurt an animal otherwise very tenacious of life.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: untitled, Fish]\r\n\r\nOn examining the fishes, I found that which had taken the hook,\r\nwas the _gadus Polachius_, or whiting Pollack. It was about two\r\nfeet long, and it is probable its active enemy had fastened [p074]\r\non it after it had been hooked; if _before_, it would indicate an\r\nextraordinary insensibility to pain in an animal that could attend to\r\nthe calls of appetite, whilst another was preying on its vitals. The\r\nfish which had fastened on the pollack, was the _petromyzon marinus_,\r\nor sea lamprey. It was nearly three feet long, and resembled a large\r\neel in shape. Its general colour was a dull brownish olive variegated\r\nwith bluish blotches; the back darker, and the belly paler, inclining\r\nto yellow. The eyes were small, and the mouth large and oval; but\r\nwhen distended, circular. The inside of the jaws was deeply concave,\r\nand studded with circular rows of sharp triangular teeth, that issued\r\nfrom corresponding orange-coloured papular protuberances, which\r\nformed the gums; the tongue was short and crescent-shaped, furnished\r\nwith a row of very small teeth round the edge. On the top of the\r\nhead was a small orifice, or spout-hole, from whence it discharged\r\nthe superfluous water taken at the mouth. But the circumstance that\r\nmore particularly distinguished it, was that which gave rise to the\r\nvulgar error that it had sixteen eyes. On either side of the neck,\r\ncommencing just below the real eyes, was a row of seven equidistant\r\nspiracles exactly resembling eyes; they are, however, holes lined\r\nwith a red membrane, and all opening into the mouth, an apparatus to\r\nsupply the place of gills, whose functions are to extract oxygen from\r\nthe water, and so perform the office of lungs in aquatic animals. It\r\nhad two dorsal fins, one on the lower part of the back, narrow, with\r\na roundish outline; the other commencing where the first terminated.\r\nThe spine was cartilaginous, without processes. The pericardium,\r\ncontaining a small heart, was a remarkably strong membrane, and the\r\nliver was as green as grass.\r\n\r\nThis fish is not uncommon in the North Seas, though it most abounds\r\nin the Mediterranean, where, from earliest times, it was esteemed a\r\nluxurious dish. Fish-ponds were purposely constructed to preserve\r\nit. On our coast, Pennant observes, that it is found most frequently\r\nat the mouth of the Severn, which river it sometimes ascends, where\r\nit is occasionally taken, firmly attached to a stone by its mouth,\r\nwhile its tail and body are waving freely to the current. Its\r\nadhesion at such times is so strong, that it may be lifted with a\r\nstone of twelve pounds weight appended to its mouth. This faculty\r\nis owing to its [p075] power of suction; while the circumstance of\r\nits circular jaws coming in close contact with the surface of the\r\nbody excludes the external air within the cavity of the mouth, and\r\nso adheres like the hand placed on the cup of an air-pump. It is\r\nfrom this remarkable property, that its scientific name has been\r\nimposed[25]. Its vulgar name, lamprey, from lampetra, has a similar\r\nderivation. By the Romans it was named muræna. As this fish was well\r\nknown and highly prized by the ancients, there is none that has been\r\nso frequently described and alluded to. Aristotle, Pliny, Tacitus,\r\nColumella, Ælian, Seneca, and Oppian, have mentioned its properties\r\nand habits, which correspond exactly with those I have described\r\nabove. Pliny says, in the northern parts of France, and consequently\r\ncontiguous to the British Isles, the lampreys have seven spots in\r\nthe jaws, resembling the constellation of the plough, evidently the\r\nsame as the eyes, which vulgar opinion assigns to the fish[26]. Their\r\nextreme voracity was such, that criminals were thrown among them to\r\nbe devoured. Seneca relates, that Vedius Pollio, a Roman knight,\r\nordered his servant, who had broken a crystal vase, to be thrown into\r\na large pond of lampreys[27]; and Columella writes, that they were\r\nsometimes seized with a rabid fury, that resembled canine madness;\r\nin the access of which, they seized upon other fish, so that it was\r\nimpossible to keep them in the same pond[28]; and to account for this\r\nextraordinary ferocity, Oppian and others assert, that the lamprey\r\nis impregnated by a serpent; the one issuing from the sea, and the\r\nother rushing down to the rocks, inflamed with madness, to consummate\r\nthe impregnation; and adds, that the extraordinary intercourse was\r\neffected by the lamprey seizing the serpent’s head in its [p076]\r\nmouth[29]. This singular copulation was the reason why the Romans,\r\nwho were immoderately fond of lampreys, did not wish to eat them,\r\nwhen impregnated by the supposed serpent. Horace, therefore, makes\r\nNasidienus, among the blunders of his supper, serve it in that\r\nstate[30].\r\n\r\nLampreys were a favourite dish with our own early monarchs. Henry\r\nII. died by eating them to excess. The celebrated Pope also owed his\r\ndeath to a surfeit of them. Doctor Johnson remarks in his life of the\r\npoet, that he was in the habit of cooking them himself in a silver\r\nsaucepan. The Corporation of Oxford still make up a periodical pye\r\nof this fish for the king, in compliance with ancient usage. But\r\nlampreys have lost their rank at corporation feasts, in consequence\r\nof the more delicious and wholesome turtle being introduced into\r\nmodern cookery.\r\n\r\nI have never noticed lampreys in the Dublin fish-market; and though\r\nthey are frequently used in the South of Ireland, I do not know if\r\nthey have ever been made an article of food in Dublin, or the north,\r\nwhere they are rarely met with.\r\n\r\n C.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [25] Petromyzon, _a_ πετρον, saxum, and μυζαω, sugere.\r\n\r\n [26] In Gallia septentrionale murænis omnibus dextra in maxilla\r\n septenæ maculæ ad formam septentrionis aureo colore fulgent.

We afterwards\r\nfound that the greater part of the facts which we had observed, had\r\nbeen previously described by Mr. Lindsay [p077] and Dr. Dutrochet.\r\nMr. Lindsay’s observations are to be met with in a MS. preserved in\r\nthe library of the Royal Society, which is dated July 1790: this\r\nessay is alluded to by Dr. Smith in his “Introduction to Botany.”\r\nDr. Dutrochet’s experiments were published in his “Recherches\r\nanatomiques et physiologiques sur la Structure intime des Animaux\r\net des Végétaux,” which appeared in 1824. With the latter author\r\nthe reputation of originality is likely to rest: not undeservedly,\r\nindeed, as there is no reason to suppose that _his_ experiments\r\nwere suggested by a knowledge of those performed by Lindsay. It\r\nis, however, an act of literary justice to secure to Mr. Lindsay\r\nthe credit of undoubted priority in describing the phenomena which\r\nhe noticed in common with Dutrochet. I have drawn up the following\r\nremarks partly for this purpose—partly to have an opportunity of\r\nmentioning some circumstances which escaped the observation of both\r\nexperimentalists.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the Mimosa Pudica consist either of one or two or\r\nthree pairs of leaflets, and occasionally terminate by an odd\r\none. Each leaflet bears from twenty to sixty subleaflets, which\r\nare disposed in pairs. The petiole or stalk of each leaf, at the\r\nextremity which is attached to the branch or stem of the peant,\r\nswells into an intumescence varying from three to five in length. A\r\nsimilar intumescence, of proportionate dimensions, is seen upon each\r\nsubpetiole, where it is articulated with the petiole, and upon the\r\nbase of the stalk of each subleaflet: the intumescence is the part in\r\nwhich motion takes place.\r\n\r\nDuring the day-time the petioles are observed to have a direction\r\nupwards, or rather to form an acute angle with the upper part of\r\nthe stem or branch, to which they are attached: the subpetioles are\r\ndivergent: the subleaflets are spread out, so as to lie nearly in one\r\nplane. (_Fig._ 1.)\r\n\r\nDuring the night the petioles are found to be depressed; the\r\nsubpetioles to be drawn together, the subleaflets folded, the upper\r\nor solar surfaces of each pair being brought into contact. (_Fig._ 2.)\r\n\r\nThe leaves rise, the leaflets diverge, and open by throwing down\r\ntheir subleaflets, at daybreak: the opposite changes occur about\r\nsunset. The experiments that are to be described, are supposed to be\r\nperformed in the day-time. [p078]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 1.]\r\n\r\nIf a terminal subleaflet be pinched with forceps, or cut with\r\nscissors, it rises, together with its fellow; then the next pair\r\nrise; then the next; and so on in succession, till all the pairs of\r\nsubleaflets upon the same subpetiole are folded. In a little time\r\nafterwards, the petiole is bent downwards at its intumescence; and in\r\na few seconds more the remaining leaflets upon the same petiole fold\r\ntheir subleaflets in pairs, from the base towards the point of the\r\nleaflet.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 2.]\r\n\r\nIf a subleaflet be burnt, instead of being cut or pinched, the\r\nphenomena above described occur more rapidly: and after they have\r\ntaken place, the adjoining leaves upon the same branch are bent down\r\nin succession, their leaflets brought together, and their subleaflets\r\nfolded. If the plant be very vigorous and lively, an impression\r\n[p079] made upon one leaf affects the rest in succession. It is well\r\nknown that the stem, branches, flowers, and roots of the sensitive\r\nplant have no motion. But M. Desfontaines observed that, on touching\r\nthe roots with sulphuric acid, the leaves become folded; and M.\r\nDutrochet obtained a similar result on burning either the flower or\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 3.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 4.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 5.]\r\n\r\nIf the plant be shaken, all the leaves are simultaneously thrown\r\ndown, and their leaflets folded. Mr. Lindsay attempted to elucidate\r\nthe action of the intumescence in raising and depressing the petiole,\r\nin the following manner. He cut out a portion from the upper or solar\r\nsurface of the intumescence; after which he found that the petiole,\r\nupon recovering, rose higher than before, (_Fig._ 3.) From another\r\nleaf he removed the inferior portion of the intumescence: he found,\r\nupon _this_ injury, that the leaf declined more than before, and\r\ndid not again rise, (_Fig._ 4.) He noticed that a thin slice, pared\r\nfrom either surface of the intumescence, has a like effect, but in\r\na less degree than a deep excision: and he found that when similar\r\nexperiments are made upon the intumescence of the subpetiole, there\r\nis no essential difference in the result.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Lindsay discovered, that the force which raises the petiole\r\nexists in the lower part of the intumescence, and that which\r\ndepresses it, in the upper. He seems to have considered that the\r\ntemporary excess of force in either part is produced by an impulsion\r\nof the sap from the vessels of the yielding portion into those of the\r\nopposite portion. [p080]\r\n\r\nDr. Dutrochet viewed these phenomena in some respects more justly. He\r\nremarked, in addition to what Lindsay had observed, that if, instead\r\nof the upper and under surface, the lateral part of the intumescence\r\nbe removed, the petiole becomes not raised or deflected, but inclined\r\ntowards the side on which it is injured (_Fig._ 5); and that if\r\nlongitudinal slices of the upper, or under, or lateral portions\r\nof the intumescence are immersed in water, these separate slices\r\nimmediately become incurvated, that edge being concave which looks\r\ntowards the axis of the intumescence. From these facts Dutrochet\r\ninferred that the texture of the intumescence possesses some\r\nmodification of irritability; that, when excited, each length of the\r\nintumescence (to use a very imperfect expression) forcibly assumes\r\nan incurvated figure, like a curved spring returning from a state of\r\ntemporary extension; that the petiole is raised, when the action of\r\nthe lower part of the intumescence predominates; is depressed, when\r\nthe upper portion acts with increased energy.\r\n\r\nMr. Burnett and myself had arrived at very similar conclusions\r\nrespecting the agency of the intumescence, before we became\r\nacquainted with the inquiries of Lindsay and Dutrochet.\r\n\r\nIn Dutrochet’s able researches, a more exact analysis, however,\r\nwas obtained of the functions of this part. He discovered that the\r\ncortex of the intumescence is the seat of its irritability: for upon\r\nwholly removing the bark, so as to expose the ligneous substance, the\r\npetiole was found to have been rendered motionless. Nevertheless,\r\nthe intumescence, thus mutilated, remains capable of transmitting an\r\nimpression made upon its leaflets to the leaves adjoining, Dutrochet\r\nfurther ascertained, that the ligneous substance alone is fitted to\r\nconvey the peculiar stimulus, which spreads, from a point of the\r\nplant that has been irritated, to the adjoining leaves.\r\n\r\nThe experiments already mentioned appear to explain the mode in which\r\nthe elevation and depression of the petiole, and the divergence\r\nand approximation of the subpetioles are produced. It is probable\r\nthat the contrivance for folding and expanding the subleaflets is\r\nof a similar nature. Mr. Burnett and myself conjectured that each\r\nsubleaflet is raised by the under part of the intumescence that\r\nexists at its base, and [p081] depressed by some action of the upper\r\nportion of the same intumescence. In trying the soundness of this\r\nhypothesis, we met with the following evidence in its favour:—\r\n\r\nMr. Lindsay had observed, that at the moment when the petiole is\r\ndepressed, the under part of its intumescence assumes a deeper\r\ncolour. But the under part of the intumescence of the petiole is\r\nthe portion which is shortened during its depression, and which is\r\novercome on this occasion by the superior force of the upper portion.\r\n\r\nNow it is to be remarked that in the subleaflets the upper part\r\nof the little intumescence belonging to each corresponds, in one\r\nrespect alluded to, with the lower portion of the intumescence of\r\nthe petiole; _it is the portion shortened when the leaf is folded_.\r\nAnd we found, upon examination, that it likewise distinctly changes\r\ncolour at the moment when the subleaflet rises, while the under\r\nsurface of the intumescence of the subleaflet does not change its hue.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing this inquiry, another point of correspondence between\r\nthe mechanism which depresses the petiole, and that which raises the\r\nsubleaflets, was stated, which has yet additional interest.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 6.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 7.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 8.]\r\n\r\nWhen the plant is not in its most lively state, the under surface of\r\nthe intumescence of the subleaflet (_b_, _Fig._ 2,) and the upper\r\nsurface of the intumescence of the petiole (_a_, _Fig._ 6,) may be\r\npricked with a needle, without producing action. But if the opposite\r\nsurfaces, those namely, which change colour and are shortened when\r\nthe petiole is depressed and the subleaflets folded, are touched\r\nwith the point of the needle these actions are instantaneously\r\nproduced. Here the [p082] subleaflet is most delicately sensible;\r\n_a slight touch_ with the point of a needle upon the upper surface\r\nof the intumescence of the subleaflet (_c_, _Fig._ 1,) causes the\r\nsingle subleaflet so stimulated to rise; and in this manner all the\r\nsubleaflets upon one side of a leaflet may be raised, their fellows\r\nremaining expanded: if the touch be something sharper, the fellow\r\nsubleaflet rises at the same time; if ruder still, the next pair of\r\nleaflets fold directly afterwards, and the irritation then proceeds\r\nentirely through the leaflet. But the most satisfactory and curious\r\nresults are obtained on stimulating the extension surface of the\r\nintumescence of the petiole. The needle may be applied to every point\r\nupon the upper or solar half of the intumescence of the petiole\r\n(_a_, _Fig._ 6,) without producing any visible effect; but if the\r\nirritation be applied upon the under half, (_d_, _Fig._ 6,) either\r\nquite below or laterally, the petiole is immediately depressed. The\r\ntransition is abrupt from the surface against which the needle may be\r\nmade to prick, without exciting action, to one which, when the needle\r\nreaches it, causes the petiole to be instantaneously thrown down.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that each intumescence has a surface\r\nespecially adapted to receive mechanical impressions; which surface\r\nis placed on the side of the intumescence opposite to that, by which\r\nthe consequent motion is produced. A curious but vague analogy may be\r\ntraced between these surfaces of the sensitive plant and the organs\r\nof sense in animals.\r\n\r\nWe painted with a thick layer of lamp-black in oil the intumescence\r\nof different petioles in different ways; the upper surface of one,\r\nthe under surface of another, the side of a third. The experiment was\r\nfollowed by no sensible effect. After a few minutes the petioles,\r\nwhich had been thrown down by the operation, rose again in each case,\r\nand fell again as readily as before upon being stimulated afresh.\r\n\r\nWe tried what result would ensue upon slitting the intumescence of\r\nthe petiole horizontally. The petiole, after this injury, did not\r\nrecover its usual direction; the intumescence appeared to have wholly\r\nlost its properties; the leaf seemed to depress the petiole by its\r\nweight alone, yet the leaflets expanded, and exhibited their usual\r\nirritability, upon the depending stalk. The same effect, however, was\r\nobserved, when the [p083] intumescence was divided by a longitudinal\r\nincision, made vertically instead of horizontally.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that Dutrochet discovered that the ligneous\r\nfibre is the channel, along which an impression is conveyed from\r\none part to another. Mr. Burnett and myself had made one or two\r\nexperiments upon the course which the irritation follows when\r\nspreading from leaflet to leaflet, where several are placed upon the\r\nsame petiole.\r\n\r\nIf the upper third of a petiole bearing four leaflets be divided\r\nlongitudinally, the irritability of the leaflets remains for many\r\ndays unimpaired; upon cutting with scissors one subleaflet after the\r\nplant has recovered itself, the irritation is observed to descend\r\nthe wounded leaflet, and then to pass to that adjoining upon the\r\nsame side of the petiole: afterwards the petiole falls, but there\r\nthe effect stops; it does not extend to the two other leaflets;\r\nthe direct route is cut through, and the irritation seems to find\r\nno circuitous way, as might have been expected, perhaps through\r\nthe intumescence of the petiole back again to the leaflets, on its\r\nsummit. If on a petiole, bearing four leaflets, a lateral incision be\r\nmade, cutting the petiole half through it at a point between the two\r\nleaflets which are situated on one side, upon irritating either of\r\nthe leaflets, between which the incision has been made, it folds its\r\nsubleaflets; then the two opposite leaflets fold _their_ subleaflets;\r\nand _last of all_, the leaflet next adjoining that first irritated,\r\nbut isolated from it by the incision, becomes folded.\r\n\r\nIn the few remarks which I have thus put together, I have quoted\r\nLindsay and Dutrochet only as far as their researches anticipated\r\nmy own: I leave unnoticed many experiments, in several of which\r\nthese authors are again found to have accidentally coincided. The\r\nexperiments to which I allude do not, however, serve to illustrate\r\nthe nature of the motion exhibited by the sensitive plant, to the\r\nexamination of which subject alone my attention was, in the present\r\ninstance, directed, in the expectation that it might throw light upon\r\nthe obscure and interesting subject of muscular action.\r\n\r\n I remain, my dear Sir, Your’s truly,\r\n HERBERT MAYO.\r\n\r\n 19, _George Street, Hanover Square_,\r\n _August 29, 1827_.\r\n\r\n[p084]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Experiments on the Nature of Labarraque’s disinfecting Soda\r\n Liquid_. By M. Faraday, F.R.S., Corr. Mem. R. Acad. Sciences, Paris,\r\n &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The following experimental investigations relate to the nature of\r\nthat medicinal preparation which M. Labarraque has lately introduced\r\nto the world, and named _Chloride of oxide of Sodium_. They were\r\noccasioned by the accounts which were given of this and other\r\nsubstances of similar power, to the members of the Royal Institution,\r\nat two of their Friday evening meetings[31]; the value of the\r\npreparation, the uncertainty of its nature, and the inaccuracy of its\r\nname, all urging the inquiry.\r\n\r\n2. In the first instance the inquiry was directed to the nature of\r\nthe action exerted by chlorine gas upon a solution of carbonate\r\nof soda, questions having arisen in the minds of many, whether it\r\nwas or was not identical with the action exerted by the same gas\r\non a solution of the caustic alkali, and whether carbonic acid was\r\nevolved during the operation or not. Chlorine gas was therefore\r\ncarefully prepared, and after being washed was sent into a solution\r\nof carbonate of soda, in the proportions directed by M. Labarraque;\r\n_i. e._ 2800 grains of crystallized carbonate of soda were dissolved\r\nin 1.28 pints of water; and being put into a Woulfe’s apparatus,\r\ntwo-thirds of the chlorine evolved from a mixture of 967 grains\r\nof salt with 750 grains of oxide of manganese, when acted upon by\r\n967 grains of oil of vitriol, previously diluted with 750 grains\r\nof water, were passed into it; the remaining third being partly\r\ndissolved in the washing water, and partly retained in the open space\r\nof the retort and washing vessel. The operation was conducted slowly,\r\nthat as little muriatic acid as possible might be carried over into\r\nthe alkali. The common air ejected from the bottle containing the\r\nsolution was collected and examined; but from the beginning to the\r\nend of the operation not a particle of carbonic acid was disengaged\r\nfrom the solution, although the chlorine was readily absorbed.\r\nUltimately a liquid of a very pale [p085] yellow colour was obtained,\r\nbeing the same as M. Labarraque’s soda liquor, and with which the\r\ninvestigations were made that will hereafter be described.\r\n\r\n3. An experiment was then instituted, in which the effect of excess\r\nof chlorine, upon a solution of carbonate of soda of the same\r\nstrength as the former, was rendered evident. The solution was put\r\ninto two Woulfe’s bottles, the chlorine well washed and passed\r\nthrough, until ultimately it bubbled through both portions without\r\nabsorption of any appreciable quantity. As soon as the common air\r\nwas expelled, the absorption of the chlorine was so complete in the\r\nfirst bottle, that no air or gas of any kind passed into the second,\r\na proof that carbonic acid was not liberated in that stage of the\r\nexperiment. Continuing the introduction of the chlorine, the solution\r\nin the first bottle gradually became yellow, the gas not being yet\r\nvisible by its colour in the atmosphere above the solution, although\r\nchlorine could be detected there by litmus paper. Up to this time no\r\ncarbonic acid gas had been evolved; but the first alkaline solution\r\nsoon acquired a brighter colour, and now carbonic acid gas began\r\nto separate from all parts of it, and passing over into the second\r\nbottle, carried a little chlorine with it. The soda solution in the\r\nfirst bottle still continued to absorb chlorine, whilst the evolution\r\nof carbonic acid increased, and the colour became heightened.\r\nAfter some time the evolution of carbonic acid diminished, smaller\r\nquantities of the chlorine were absorbed by the solution, and the\r\nrest passing into the atmosphere in the bottle, went from thence\r\ninto the second vessel, and there caused the same series of changes\r\nand actions that had occurred in the first. The solution in the\r\nfirst bottle was now of a bright chlorine yellow colour, and the gas\r\nbubbled up through it as it would through saturated water.\r\n\r\n4. When the chlorine had saturated the soda solution in the second\r\nbottle, and an excess of gas sufficient to fill several large\r\njars had been passed through the whole apparatus, the latter was\r\ndismounted, the solutions put into bottles and distinguished as\r\nthe saturated solutions of carbonated soda; they were of a bright\r\ngreenish-yellow colour, and had an insupportable odour of chlorine.\r\n\r\n5. The saturated solution (4) was then examined as to the [p086]\r\nchange which had been occasioned by the action of the chlorine. It\r\nbleached powerfully, and apparently contained no carbonated alkali:\r\nbut when a glass rod was dipped into it and dried in a warm current\r\nof air, the saline matter left, when applied to moistened turmeric\r\npaper, reddened it considerably at first, and then bleached it; and\r\nthis piece of paper being dried and afterwards moistened upon the\r\nbleached part, gave indications of alkali to fresh turmeric paper.\r\n\r\n6. A portion of the saturated solution (4) being warmed, instantly\r\nevolved chlorine gas, then assumed a dingy appearance, and ultimately\r\nbecame nearly colourless; after which it had an astringent and saline\r\ntaste. Being evaporated to dryness at a very moderate temperature, it\r\nleft a saline mass, consisting of much common salt, a considerable\r\nquantity of chlorate of soda, and a trace of carbonate of soda. This\r\nmixture had no bleaching powers. The dingy appearance, assumed in\r\nthe first instance, was found to be occasioned by a little manganese\r\nwhich had passed over into the solutions, notwithstanding the care\r\ntaken in evolving and washing the gas.\r\n\r\n7. From these experiments it was evident that when chlorine was\r\npassed _in excess_ into a solution of carbonate of soda (3), the\r\ncarbonic acid was expelled, and the soda acted upon as if it were\r\ncaustic, a mixture of chloride of sodium and chlorate of soda being\r\nproduced; with the exception of the small portion of carbonate of\r\nsoda which, it appears, may remain for some time in the solution in\r\ncontact with the excess of chlorine at common temperatures, without\r\nundergoing this change. The quantities of chloride of sodium and\r\nchlorate of soda were not ascertained, no doubt being entertained\r\nthat they were in the well-known proportions which occur when caustic\r\nsoda is used.\r\n\r\n8. The Labarraque’s soda liquor which had been prepared as described\r\n(2), was now examined relative to the part the chlorine played in\r\nit, or the change the alkali had undergone, and was soon found to\r\nbe very different to that which has been described, as indeed the\r\nexperiments I had seen made by Mr. Phillips[32] led me to expect. The\r\nsolution had but little odour of chlorine, its taste was at first\r\nsharp, saline, scarcely at [p087] all alkaline, but with a persisting\r\nastringent biting effect upon the tongue. When applied to turmeric\r\npaper, it first reddened and then bleached it.\r\n\r\n9. A portion of the solution (2) being boiled, gave out no chlorine;\r\nit seemed but little changed by the operation, having the same\r\npeculiar taste, and nearly the same bleaching power as before. This\r\nis a sufficient proof that the chlorine, though in a state ready to\r\nbleach or disinfect, must not be considered as in the ordinary state\r\nof solution, either in water or a saline fluid; for ebullition will\r\nfreely carry off the chlorine under the latter circumstances.\r\n\r\n10. A portion evaporated on the sandbath rather hastily, gave a dry\r\nsaline mass, quite unlike that left by the _saturated solution_\r\nalready described (6); and which, when dissolved, had the same\r\nastringent taste as before, and bleached solution of indigo very\r\npowerfully: when compared with an equal portion of the unevaporated\r\nsolution, which had been placed in the mean time in the dark, its\r\nbleaching power upon diluted sulphate of indigo was 30, that of the\r\nformer being 76. Another portion, evaporated in a still more careful\r\nmanner, gave a mass of damp crystals, which, when dissolved, had the\r\ntaste, smell, and bleaching power of the original solution, with\r\nalmost equal strength.\r\n\r\n11. These experiments shewed sufficiently that the whole of the\r\nchlorine had not acted upon the carbonate of soda to produce chloride\r\nof sodium, and chlorate of soda; that much was in a peculiar state of\r\nsolution or union which enabled it to withstand ebullition, and yet\r\nto act freely as a bleaching or disinfecting agent; and that probably\r\nlittle or none had combined with the sodium, or been converted into\r\nchloric acid. To put these ideas to the test, two equal portions of\r\nthe Labarraque solution were taken; one was put into a large tube,\r\nclosed at one extremity, diluted sulphuric acid was added till in\r\nexcess, and then air blown through the mixture by a long small open\r\ntube, proceeding from the mouth, for the purpose of carrying off\r\nthe chlorine; the contents of the tube were then heated nearly to\r\nthe boiling point, air being continually passed through. In this\r\nway all the chlorine which had combined with the carbonated alkali\r\nwithout decomposing it, was set free by the sulphuric acid, and\r\ncarried off by the current of air and vapour, whilst any which had\r\nacted chemically upon the alkali would, [p088] after the action of\r\nthe sulphuric acid, be contained in solution as muriatic and chloric\r\nacids, and from the diluted state of the whole, would not be removed\r\nby the after-process, but remain to be rendered evident by tests. The\r\nother portion being diluted, had sulphuric acid added also in excess,\r\nbut no attempt was made to remove the chlorine. Equal quantities of\r\nthese two portions in the same state of dilution were then examined\r\nby nitrate of silver for the quantities of chlorine sensible in them,\r\nand it was found that the latter portion, or that which retained the\r\nwhole of the chlorine thrown into it, contained above sixty times as\r\nmuch as the former.\r\n\r\n12. Now although it may be supposed that in the former portion that\r\npart of the chlorine, which, in acting energetically, had produced\r\nchloric acid, could not be detected by the nitrate of silver, yet\r\nmore than a sixth of the small portion which remains cannot be thus\r\nhidden; and even that quantity is diminished by the sulphuric acid\r\npresent in excess, which tends to make the chlorine in the chlorate\r\nsensible to nitrate of silver: so that the experiment shews that\r\nnearly 59 parts out of 60 of the chlorine in M. Labarraque’s liquid\r\nare in a state of weak combination with the carbonated alkali, and\r\nmay be separated by acids in its original condition; that this\r\nquantity is probably wholly available in the liquid when used as a\r\nbleaching or disinfecting agent; that little, if any, of the chlorine\r\nforms chloride of sodium and chlorate of soda with the alkali of\r\nthe solution; and that the portion of chlorine used in preparing\r\nthe substance which is brought into an inactive state, is almost\r\ninsensible in quantity.\r\n\r\n13. The peculiar nature of this compound or solution, with the\r\nresults Mr. Phillips had shewn me (8), obtained by evaporation of a\r\nsimilar preparation to dryness, induced me to try the effects of slow\r\nevaporation, crystallization, heat, and air upon it. In the first\r\nplace five equal portions of the solution prepared by myself were\r\nmeasured out: two were put into stoppered bottles, two were put into\r\nbasins and covered over with bibulous paper, and one was put into a\r\nbasin which was left open; all were set aside in an obscure place,\r\nand remained from July 16th to August 28th. Being then examined, the\r\nportions in the basins were found crystallized and dry; the crystals\r\nwere large and flat, striated and imperfect, resembling those formed\r\n[p089] in a similar way from carbonate of soda. They were not\r\nsmall and acicular, were nearly alike in the three basins, and had\r\neffloresced only on a few minute points. A part of one portion, when\r\ndissolved, gave a solution, having an alkaline taste, without any\r\nof the pungency of Labarraque’s liquid; and which, when tested by\r\nturmeric paper, reddened, but did not bleach it.\r\n\r\n14. One of these portions that had effloresced least was selected,\r\nand being dissolved, was compared in bleaching power upon diluted\r\nsulphate of indigo, with one of the portions of solution that had\r\nbeen preserved in bottles. The former had scarcely any visible\r\neffect, though sulphuric acid was added to assist the action; a\r\nsingle measure of the indigo liquor coloured the solution permanently\r\nblue, whereas seventy-seven such measures were bleached by the\r\nportion from the bottle. Hence the process of slow crystallization\r\nhad either almost entirely expelled the chlorine, or else had caused\r\nit to react upon the alkali, and by entering into strong chemical\r\ncombination as chloride and chlorate, had rendered it inert as a\r\nbleaching or disinfecting agent.\r\n\r\n15. From the appearance of the crystals there was no reason to expect\r\nthe latter effect; but to put the question to the proof, one of the\r\nevaporated portions, and one of the fluid portions contained in the\r\nbottles, were acted upon by sulphuric acid, heat, and a current of\r\nair, in the manner already described (11), to separate the chlorine\r\nthat had not combined as chloride or chlorate. They were then\r\ncompared with an equal portion of the solution, which retained all\r\nits chlorine, nitrate of silver being used as before: the quantity of\r\nchloride indicated for the latter portion was 60 parts; whilst that\r\nof the fluid portion deprived of as much free chlorine as could be,\r\nby sulphuric acid and blowing, was 6 parts; and for the evaporated\r\nand crystallized portion, similarly cleared of free chlorine, only\r\n1.5 parts.\r\n\r\n16. This result, as compared with the former experiment of a similar\r\nkind (11), shewed, that though reaction of the chlorine on the\r\ncarbonate had taken place in the evaporated portion, it was only to a\r\nvery slight extent, since the chlorine was almost as much separated\r\nfrom it by the process altogether, as it had been from the recent\r\npreparation by sulphuric acid, blowing, and heat. The experiment\r\nshewed also that there [p090] was a gradual reaction of the chlorine\r\nand alkali in the fluid preparation, proceeding to a greater extent\r\nthan in the evaporated portion; for chlorine, equal to five parts,\r\nwas found by the nitrate of silver to remain. Hence this preparation\r\nis one which deteriorates even in the small space of forty-three\r\ndays. Whether the effect will proceed to any great extent, prolonged\r\nexperiments only can shew.\r\n\r\n17. From an experiment made upon larger quantities of the Labarraque\r\nliquor, it would appear that the force of crystallization alone\r\nis sufficient to exclude the chlorine. A quantity was put into an\r\nevaporating basin, and left covered over with paper from July 16th\r\nto August 28th. Being then examined, a few large crystals were found\r\ncovered over with a dense solution; the whole had the innocuous\r\nodour of Labarraque’s fluid, and the fluid the usual acrid, biting\r\ntaste. The crystals being separated, one of the largest and most\r\nperfect was chosen, and being well wiped on the exterior, and pressed\r\nbetween folds of bibulous paper, was rubbed down in water, so as to\r\nmake a saturated solution. This had no astringent taste like that of\r\nLabarraque’s fluid, or the mother-liquor, but one purely alkaline;\r\nand when applied to turmeric paper, reddened, but did not bleach it.\r\nEqual portions of this saturated solution and of the mother-liquor\r\nwere then compared in bleaching power, acid being added to the former\r\nto assist the effect: it was found, notwithstanding that portions of\r\nmother-liquor must have adhered to the crystal, that its solution had\r\nnot 1/21th part the power of the mother-liquor. This, in conjunction\r\nwith the other experiments, is a striking instance of the manner\r\nin which the carbonate of soda acts, as a simple substance, with\r\nthe chlorine in the solution. The crystal itself had never been in\r\ncontact with the air: but whether it should be considered as the\r\nexcess of carbonate of soda only which crystallized; or whether it\r\nis essential to the formation of these crystals that chlorine should\r\nsimultaneously be given off into the air; or what would take place,\r\nif the water were abstracted without the evolution of chlorine, I\r\nhave not determined.\r\n\r\n18. Notwithstanding the perfect manner in which the chlorine may be\r\nthus separated by crystallization and slow evaporation to dryness,\r\nyet it is certain that by quick evaporation a [p091] substance\r\napparently quite dry may be obtained, which yet possesses strong\r\nbleaching power. In one experiment, where, of two equal portions, one\r\nhad been evaporated in the course of twenty-four hours to dryness\r\nupon the warm part of a sandbath, when compared with the former, it\r\nhad not lost more than one-third of its bleaching power.\r\n\r\n19. With the desire of knowing what effect carbonic acid would have\r\non Labarraque’s fluid, and whether it possessed in a greater or\r\nsmaller degree the power of ordinary acids to expel the chlorine,\r\nportions of the solution were put into two Woulfe’s bottles, and\r\na current of carbonic acid gas passed through them. The gas was\r\nobtained from sulphuric acid and whitening in a soda-water apparatus,\r\nand was well washed in water. The stream of gas brought away small\r\nportions of chlorine with it, but they were not sensible to the\r\nsmell, and could only be detected by putting litmus paper into the\r\ncurrent. An immense quantity of gas, equal to nearly 1300 times the\r\nvolume of the fluid, was sent through; but yet very little chlorine\r\nwas removed, and the bleaching powers of the fluid were but little\r\ndiminished, though it no longer appeared alkaline to turmeric paper.\r\nAir was then passed through the solution in large quantity; it also\r\nremoved chlorine, but apparently not quite so much as carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n20. One other experiment was made upon the degree in which the\r\ncarbonate of soda in Labarraque’s liquor resisted decomposition by\r\nthe chlorine, even at high temperature. Two equal portions of the\r\nfluid were taken, and one of them boiled rapidly for fifteen minutes;\r\nboth were then acted upon by sulphuric acid, blowing, and heat, as\r\ndescribed (11), and the two were then tested by nitrate of silver,\r\nto ascertain the quantity of chlorine remaining: it was nearly\r\nthree times as much in the boiled as in the unboiled portion; and\r\nby comparing this with the results before obtained (11), it will be\r\nseen that, after boiling for a quarter of an hour, not more than a\r\ntwentieth part of the chlorine had acted upon the alkali, to form\r\nchloride and chlorate.\r\n\r\n21. It would seem as if I were unacquainted with Dr. Granville’s\r\npaper upon this subject, published in the last volume of this\r\nJournal, p. 371, were I to close my remarks without taking [p092]\r\nany notice of it. Unfortunately, Dr. Granville has mistaken M.\r\nLabarraque’s direction, and by passing chlorine, to “complete\r\nsaturation,” through the carbonate, instead of using the quantities\r\ndirected, has failed in obtaining Labarraque’s really curious and\r\nvery important liquid; to which, in consequence, not one of his\r\nobservations or experiments applies, although the latter are quite\r\ncorrect in themselves.\r\n\r\n _Royal Institution, Sept. 3, 1827_.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [31] See the last volume of this Journal, pp. 211, 460.\r\n\r\n [32] See Vol. I. of this Journal, p. 461; and _Phil.

By a Correspondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n My dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am happy to tell you that our prospects of new documents from Egypt\r\nare very rapidly increasing: Mr. Burton has had the good fortune to\r\ndiscover at length, in a mosque, the triple inscription for which he\r\nhas been some years in search; and he has been negotiating with the\r\nPacha for its removal. From its magnitude and state of preservation,\r\nthere is every reason to believe that it will rival the pillar of\r\nRosetta in its importance, and I sincerely hope that it will tend\r\nto check the wildness of conjecture, which has been rioting without\r\nbounds in the regions of Egyptian literature. Mr. Tattam is printing\r\na Coptic grammar, and I am preparing an Appendix, which is to contain\r\nthe rudiments of an Enchorial Lexicon: I ardently wish that Mr.\r\nBurton’s inscriptions may come to my assistance before I complete\r\nit. I have received nothing from France or from Germany for these\r\nfour years past: even what is published seems by some fatality to\r\nhave been withheld from me; and the booksellers send no answers to my\r\ncommissions. I trust your brother will not forget his kind promise to\r\nthink of me at Berlin.\r\n\r\nI have to thank him and you for your obliging present of your _Letter\r\nto Abel Remusat on the Genius of the Chinese Language_, which has\r\ngreatly interested me: the best return that I can make will be to\r\ngive you some remarks which have occurred to me on the language of\r\nhieroglyphics in general, [p093] and on the character of the English\r\nlanguage, which seems to approach, in its simplicity, as you have\r\nyourself observed, to the natural structure of the oldest languages,\r\nimmediately related to the hieroglyphical form of representation. I\r\nfear, however, that I must apologize to you for the want of method\r\nwith which I shall be obliged at present to throw my fragments\r\ntogether: but it may be allowable to make some difference between a\r\nletter and a finished essay.\r\n\r\nHieroglyphics, in their primitive form, are scarcely to be considered\r\nin any case as simply a mode of expressing an oral language: they\r\nmay be a direct and independent representation of our thoughts, that\r\nis, of recollections, or sentiments, or intentions, collateral to\r\nthe representation of the same thoughts by the language of sounds.\r\nWe find, in many of the Egyptian monuments, a double expression\r\nof the same sense: first, a simple picture, for instance, of a\r\nvotary presenting a vase to a sitting deity; each characterized by\r\nsome peculiarity of form, and each distinguished also by a name\r\nwritten over him; and this may be called a pure hieroglyphical\r\nrepresentation, though it scarcely amounts to a language, any more\r\nthan the look of love is a language of a lover. But we universally\r\nfind that the tablet is accompanied by a greater variety of\r\ncharacters which certainly do constitute a language, although we know\r\nlittle or nothing of the sounds of that language; but its import is,\r\nthat “such a king offers a vase to the deity;” and on the other side,\r\nthat “the deity grants to the king health and strength, and beauty\r\nand riches, and dominion and power.” It is common to see, in these\r\ninscriptions, a number of characters introduced, which are evidently\r\nidentical with some of those in the tablets: and however some of\r\nthem may occasionally have been employed phonetically, there can\r\nbe no question of the nature of the changes which their employment\r\nmust have gone through before they assumed the character of sounds:\r\nbut this is altogether a separate consideration, and foreign to the\r\npresent purpose.\r\n\r\nNow it is obvious that objects, delineated with the intention of\r\nrepresenting the originals to the eye by their form, must necessarily\r\nbe nouns substantive; and that the picture, containing no verb\r\nwhatever, can scarcely be said to constitute [p094] either a positive\r\nor a negative assertion. At the same time, it must be allowed that\r\na picture of King George the Fourth’s coronation, with the date 19\r\nJuly 1821, could scarcely be considered otherwise than as asserting\r\na historical truth; and if any emblem of Truth were attached to it,\r\nor if it were deposited among the records of other historical facts,\r\nit would be equivalent to the expression, “George IV. crowned in July\r\n1821,” which _scarcely_ wants the verb _was_ to convert it into a\r\npositive assertion of a fact.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, however, there seems to be no direct mode of\r\nsupplying the want of the verb _is_ or _was_ in pure hieroglyphical\r\nwriting; and if any such sign was employed in the Egyptian or the\r\nold Chinese hieroglyphics, its introduction must have been arbitrary\r\nor conventional; like the employment of a postulate in mathematics.\r\nEvery other part of a language appears capable of being reduced,\r\nwith more or less circumlocution, to the form of a noun substantive;\r\nand the English language appears to approach to the Chinese in the\r\nfacility with which all the forms of grammar may be shaken off.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, often occasion, in such cases, for a certain\r\ndegree of metaphor approaching to poetical latitude; and hence it\r\nmay happen that the least literary nations are sometimes the most\r\npoetical. It is, in fact, impossible to exclude metaphor altogether\r\nfrom the most prosaic language; and it is frequently difficult to say\r\nwhere metaphor ends and strict logical prose begins; but by degrees\r\nthe metaphor drops, and the simple figurative sense is retained. Thus\r\nwe may say _liquid ruby_ with the same exact meaning as _crimson\r\nwine_; and yet _ruby_ would never be called an adjective, though\r\nemployed merely to express the colour: in _coral lips_, however, the\r\n_coral_, first used metaphorically, is converted by habit into an\r\nadjective, and the expression is considered as synonymous with _labri\r\ncorallini_.\r\n\r\nThe general custom in English is to place the figurative substantive,\r\nused as an adjective by comparison, or by abstraction, before the\r\nname which retains its proper sense: thus a chestnut horse is a\r\nchestnut like or chestnut coloured horse; a horse chestnut is a\r\ncoarse kind of chestnut: and in this manner we are enabled to\r\nuse almost every English noun substantive as an adjective, by an\r\nellipsis of the word _like_, which, [p095] if inserted entire or\r\nabridged, would make a real adjective of the word, as war_like_,\r\nfriend_ly_. But this omission of the termination, like other figures\r\nof speech, is easily forgotten in the ordinary forms of language;\r\nand the Germans, as well as the English, make use of almost all\r\ntheir substantives in the place of adjectives, though they are\r\nmore in the habit of continuing them into single long words. When,\r\nhowever, the substantives are so used, they generally become by\r\nabstraction real adjectives: for we seldom think of a _chestnut_,\r\nin speaking of the colour of a horse; but the idea of a light brown\r\ncoat, with an ugly pale-red mane and tail, and a fidgety temper, is\r\nvery likely to occur to us: and in a horse chestnut the idea of a\r\nhorse is out of the question; we only think of a coarse fruit which\r\na man cannot eat: so that the true sense, in both these instances,\r\nis that of a quality; but _coral lips_ and _ivory hands_ are rather\r\nelliptical expressions, composed of two substantives, which might\r\nfairly be represented hieroglyphically by the assistance of a branch\r\nof coral and an elephant’s tusk. But to describe an abstract quality\r\nby any hieroglyphic character, representative of form only, would\r\nbe generally impossible: colours might be imitated, if we supposed\r\ncoloured figures to be employed; but other simple ideas, such as\r\nthose of sound or touch, could never be immediately presented to the\r\neye; and some circuitous invention would always be required for their\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nHorne Tooke has shewn, with considerable felicity of illustration,\r\nthat all the parts of speech may be resolved into the noun and the\r\nverb; but he has not pointed out so clearly that every verb may\r\nbe resolved into a noun and the single primitive verb is or was,\r\nwhich, in this sense, may be said to be the only essential verb in\r\nany language; as we find, indeed, in the Coptic, that almost every\r\nnoun becomes a verb, either by the addition of PE, or sometimes even\r\nwithout it. Thus, _the morning_ BLUSHES is synonymous with _the\r\nmorning_ IS _red_; _he loves justice_, with _he_ IS _a lover of\r\njustice_; and _I_ AM _an Englishman_, with _the person now speaking_\r\nIS _an Englishman_. But this must be understood of is, was, or will\r\nbe, in all its tenses; the idea of time, if expressed, being an\r\nessential part of the verbal sense.\r\n\r\nI confess that some of these reflections have occurred to me in\r\nlooking over a very singular work, which I had the curiosity [p096]\r\nto take up, in order to see what kind of information could be\r\npossessed by a person notoriously and professedly ignorant of the\r\norigin and relations of the language which he attempts to teach;\r\nand, in short, what kind of light could be diffused by an apostle\r\nof darkness. Blunders, and some of them ridiculous enough, must, of\r\ncourse, be found in the works of such a person, but most of them are\r\nsuch as every schoolboy might correct; and there really is so much of\r\nsagacity in some of Mr. Cobbett’s remarks on the errors of others,\r\nthat they well deserve the attention of such as are ambitious to\r\nwrite or speak with perfect accuracy.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to enter into a regular criticism of this\r\n_Grammar_; I shall merely make a few miscellaneous observations, as\r\nthey have occurred to me in reading it, several of which would be\r\nequally applicable to the best of the existing works of a similar\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIn Letter III we are told that _long_ and _short_, though adjectives,\r\ndo not express _qualities_, but merely dimension or duration; from a\r\nsingular misconception of the proper sense of the word _quality_. We\r\nfind, in Letter IV, the rule given by most grammarians, though not by\r\nall, that the article A becomes AN, when it is followed by any word\r\nbeginning with a vowel; but it is surely more natural to follow the\r\nsound than the spelling, and, as we should never think of saying an\r\n_youthful_ bride, it seems equally incorrect to say an _useful_ piece\r\nof furniture; for the initial sound is precisely the same. In the\r\nsame manner A _unit_ and A _European_, seems to sound more agreeable\r\nthan AN; and the best speakers appear to adopt this custom.\r\n\r\nLetter VIII gives us a rule for doubling the last letter of a verb in\r\nthe participle if an accent is on the last syllable: but it should\r\nbe observed that the L is doubled, whether accented or not, as in\r\n_caballing_, _travelled_, _levelled_, _cavilled_, _controlled_. The\r\nsame letter contains a “List of verbs, which, by some persons, are\r\nerroneously deemed irregular,” and which have been so deemed from the\r\ntime of our German and Saxon ancestors, though Mr. Cobbett thinks\r\nit would be more philosophical to conjugate them regularly. Thus\r\nwe may see at once that _freeze_ may as well give us _frozen_, as\r\n_frieren_ gives the Germans _gefroren_; that _hang_ may make _hung_\r\nor _hanged_, according [p097] to its sense, as in German we have\r\n_hienge_ from _hangen_, and _hängte_ from _hängen_, to execute. For\r\n_sling_ and _slung_, we have authority in _schlingen_, _geschlungen_,\r\nfor _spring_ and _sprung_ in _springen_ and _gesprungen_; for\r\n_swollen_, _swam_ or _swum_, and _swung_, in _geschwollen_,\r\n_geschwommen_, and _geschwungen_. And it is quite clear from these\r\nexamples that “the bad practice of abbreviating, or shortening,” has\r\nnothing to do with the matter.\r\n\r\nIn Letter XIV we have a very distinct examination of a rule in\r\npunctuation which has been commonly adopted by good printers, without\r\nso distinct a description of its foundation. “Commas are made use of\r\nwhen phrases, that is to say ‘portions’ of words, are ‘throw_ed_’\r\ninto a sentence, and which are not absolutely necessary to assist in\r\nits grammatical construction.” In a word, two commas are very nearly\r\nequivalent to the old fashioned parenthesis. Again, “the apostrophe\r\nought to be called the mark not of elision, but of _laziness_ and\r\n_vulgarity_;” a remark made in truly classical taste, which might\r\nhave been extended with perfect propriety to the subject of the\r\nnext paragraph, the _Hyphen_, the insertion of which is, to make it\r\nuncertain whether the words united by it are one word or two. He\r\ngoes on admirably in the next page. “_Notes_, like parentheses, are\r\n_interrupters_, and much more troublesome interrupters, because they\r\ngenerally tell a much longer story. The employing of them arises,\r\nin almost all cases, from confusion in the mind of the writer. He\r\nfinds the matter _too much for him_. He has not the talent to work\r\nit all up into one lucid whole; and, therefore, he puts part of it\r\ninto _Notes_” . . . . . “Instead of the word _and_, you often see\r\npeople put _&_. For what reason I should like to know. But to this\r\n_&_ is sometimes added a _c_; thus, _&c._ _And_ is, in Latin, _et_,\r\nand _c_ is the first letter of the Latin word _caetera_, which means\r\nthe like, or _so on_. This abbreviation of a foreign word is a most\r\nconvenient thing for such writers as have too much indolence or\r\ntoo little sense to say fully and clearly what they ought to say.\r\nIf you _mean_ to say _and the like_, or, _and so on_, why not say\r\nit? . . . The abbreviation is very frequently made use of _without\r\nthe writer having_ any idea of its import.” But it is surely a\r\nmischievous maxim, never to “think of _mending_ what you write. Let\r\nit _go_. No [p098] patching; no _after painting_.” On the other\r\nhand he is right in protesting “against the use of what, by some,\r\nis called the _dash_. Who is to know what is intended by the use of\r\nthese _dashes_? . . . . It is a cover for ignorance as to the use of\r\npoints; and it can answer no other purpose.”\r\n\r\nIn Letter XV, there is a singular conceit with regard to the keeping\r\nup a distinction between _a_ and _an_, where it is insisted that we\r\nmust not say “_a_ dog, cat, owl, and sparrow,” because owl requires\r\n_an_; “and that it should be, a dog, a cat, an owl, and a sparrow;”\r\nwhich is certainly better, and would be so, even if there were no owl\r\nin the question.\r\n\r\nLetter XVII. The criticism on Milton’s “than _whom_ none higher sat,”\r\nis perfectly correct. _Than_ is never a preposition, and is simply a\r\nvariation from the older _then_, both in English and in German. _John\r\nis better than James_ means simply John is good first, then James:\r\n_er_ is _eher_ or _e’er_. _Who_ would sound awkwardly, but would be\r\nmore grammatical.\r\n\r\nLetter XIX gives a definition of the ellipsis, which would be a\r\nlesson to Apollonius himself: the compasses, it seems, “do not take\r\ntheir sweep all round, but leave out parts of the area or surface.”\r\nThe objection to Blackstone’s language is very questionable. “The\r\nvery _scheme and model_ WAS settled,” may, perhaps, be defended,\r\nbecause scheme and model are considered as one thing, the words being\r\nintended to illustrate each other, but not to point out different\r\nattributes of the administration of justice; and both words may\r\nbe admitted, as a collective term, to govern a singular rather\r\nthan a plural verb. It seems also to be an error to make _with_ a\r\nconjunction rather than a preposition, and to say “The bag, with the\r\nguineas and dollars in it _were_ stolen,” or “zeal, with discretion,\r\n_do_ much.” “I expected to have seen,” is justly noticed as a common\r\nerror for “I expected to see.” The meaning of an _active_ verb is\r\nerroneously confounded with that of a _transitive_ verb, in the\r\nremarks on the word _elope_, which means to go off, or to run off,\r\nand we should naturally say _was_ gone off, but _had_ run off.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the subjunctive mood is dismissed in the same Letter\r\nwithout better success than has been obtained by former grammarians.\r\nAn essay was published about thirty years ago in a periodical work,\r\nwhich brings the subject into a small compass; [p099] suggesting that\r\nthe subjunctive mood ought always to be considered as a _conditional\r\nfuture_. The examples given are, “If the Elbe _is now_ open, we shall\r\nsoon have the mails, and _then_, if there _be_ any news from the\r\narmy, I will send it you immediately.” “If Catiline _was_ generous,\r\nit was in order to serve his ambition.” The subjunctive past, if I\r\n_were_, becomes present, by being the future of the past; going back\r\nto the time when the present was future, and therefore contingent;\r\nand this conditional sense involves no difficulty, except when a\r\nmistaken adherence to the fancied rules of grammar forces it in where\r\nit has no business: thus the rules of some grammarians would lead\r\nus to say, if Catiline _were_ ambitious; which is totally contrary\r\nto the true sense of the subjunctive. Mr. Cobbett seems to have\r\nsome such distinctions in view when he says that “_if_ has nothing\r\nat all to do with the government of the verb. It is the sense which\r\ngoverns.” By this he means that _if_ does not require a subjunctive\r\nunless is relates to a _future contingency_. He is right in saying\r\n“Though her chastity _is_ becoming, it gives her no claim to praise”:\r\nbut most decidedly wrong in adding “she would be criminal if she\r\n_was_ not chaste”; for _was_ is here used as relating to the present\r\ncircumstances, which are the future of the past, and therefore\r\nrequire the subjunctive _were_ to denote the condition intended. He\r\nhas, however, done signal justice to the cause of this injured verb,\r\nby introducing it for _was_, in his sixth lesson, where he says it\r\nshould have been “Your Lordship _were_ apprized of every important\r\ncircumstance.”\r\n\r\nSuch errors as this, however, are easily corrected, and many of\r\nthe acute remarks which have been here copied are well worthy the\r\nattention of practical grammarians; at the same time enough has been\r\nsaid, without any disparagement of Cobbett’s talents, to show that\r\na man cannot be well qualified to teach that which he has not had\r\nthe means of properly learning. For although the English language\r\nappears at first sight to be extremely simple and philosophical\r\nin its structure, it has, in fact, been derived from a variety of\r\nheterogeneous sources; it has undergone a variety of vicissitudes,\r\nand has served for the expression of a multiplicity of discussions\r\non the most refined subjects in literature and history and science,\r\nfor [p100] the feelings of oratory, and the passions of poetry, and\r\nit has been worn away by degrees, as the crystal in the stream is\r\nworn to a pebble, till it has returned to a simplicity which wears\r\nthe aspect of the immediate offspring of the Chinese or Egyptian or\r\nMexican Hieroglyphics. But with all this, it has still some spots,\r\nsome idioms, which invariable custom obliges us to retain; and\r\nwhich can only be distinguished from corruptions and vulgarisms by\r\ntracing their history through the different stages of its progress,\r\nincluding, of necessity, the corresponding idioms in the parent\r\nlanguages out of which it has arisen.\r\n\r\n Believe me always, my dear Sir, Your’s very sincerely, * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Malaria: an Essay on the Production and Propagation of this Poison,\r\n and of the Nature and Localities of the Places by which it is\r\n produced, with an Enumeration of the Diseases caused by it, and of\r\n the Means of diminishing and preventing them, both at Home and in\r\n the Naval and Military Service_. By J. Mac Culloch, M.D., F.R.S.,\r\n &c. &c. Longman and Co. 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough we have given a place in our Journal to two articles on\r\nMalaria from Dr. Mac Culloch, we have thought it expedient to take\r\nsome notice of his book under the form of a review; particularly\r\nas some matters have come under our cognizance, which may add some\r\nillustrations to this subject where the author appears to have been\r\nin a state of deficient information, or to have shunned the question\r\nfor reasons which appear to us somewhat over refined.\r\n\r\nWe allude principally here to the localities and the facts, as they\r\nare now before us; circumstances and events which seem to us of the\r\ngreatest importance, as enforcing the value of the details which he\r\nhas collected, and as holding out warnings to the people respecting\r\nthe preservation of their healths, in addition to those which the\r\nwork before us has given in describing the soils or characters of\r\nground in England from which this destructive poison is generated.\r\nAnd before we proceed to the analysis of his book, we shall state\r\nwhat those are, or at least a few of them, while wondering that he\r\nshould have overlooked them, or regretting that any fancies should\r\nhave prevented him from stating what would have been of so much\r\nutility. [p101]\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that, in the last autumn, the remittent fevers in\r\nvarious parts of the country amounted to a species of pestilence,\r\nsuch as has scarcely been known in England from this cause, or we\r\nmight almost indeed say, from any other disease since the days of\r\nSydenham. Wherever ague had ever existed, or even been supposed\r\npossible, in those places was this fever found: so that in all the\r\nwell-known tracts in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent, Essex,\r\nSussex, Hampshire, and so forth, there was scarcely a house without\r\none or more inhabitants under fever, while the event, as might be\r\nsuspected, was a considerable mortality. In the parish of Marston,\r\nin Lincolnshire, for example, it amounted to 25 in 300 inhabitants;\r\nin some other places, it reached one in sixteen, one in thirteen,\r\none in nine. And so extensive was its range, that even Hastings did\r\nnot escape; while it should be almost superfluous to say that every\r\nother town on the sea-coast was so much infested by it, that they\r\nwho resorted to them for bathing, as usual, found themselves most\r\nawkwardly situated, and also suffered in considerable numbers.\r\n\r\nTo come nearer home, and to what must interest us of the metropolis\r\nmore, the same fevers were extremely abundant in various parts of\r\nthe outskirts of London, as also in the villages or towns which are\r\nconnected with it, within a range of from six to ten miles. Not\r\nto enumerate all these, this was the case throughout the range of\r\nstreets or houses which extends from Buckingham Gate to Chelsea; in\r\nwhich long line, it is said, that almost every house had a patient\r\nor more under this fever; though, as the author has truly observed,\r\nthese were mistaken for typhus, or at least thus misnamed. Thus it\r\nwas also about Vauxhall and Lambeth; and to a great extent among\r\nall that scattered mixture of town and country which follows from\r\nWhitechapel, from Bishopsgate, and so forth, and very particularly\r\nalong Ratcliffe Highway, and so on, to an indefinite range along\r\nthe river, not only on this side but on the opposite one, so as\r\nto include Rotherhithe, and then proceeding onward to Deptford,\r\nGreenwich, Woolwich, Plumstead, so as to carry us beyond the boundary\r\nwhich we proposed to notice.\r\n\r\nAnd in addition to the towns or villages which we have just named,\r\nwe may enumerate Lewisham, in which we knew one house in which there\r\nwere nine patients under this fever, which proved mortal to one.\r\nDulwich, especially subject to this disorder, Fulham, Ealing, and the\r\nseveral other villages along the Thames, as far as Chertsey; and even\r\nRichmond, [p102] where, as at Lewisham, there was one house known to\r\nus, inasmuch as being intimate friends, where ten individuals at one\r\ntime were suffering under this disease.\r\n\r\nWe must not prolong this enumeration, since we might easily occupy\r\na dozen of our pages with similar details, ranging, in fact, all\r\nover England; but we must still observe, that whatever was the\r\npestilence last year, it promises to be much greater in the present\r\none. This is easily judged from the manner in which the season has\r\nset in; but still more decidedly from the extraordinary prevalence\r\nof ague in the spring; since that which is intermittent fever then,\r\nwill be remittent in the autumn, or rather, as the author has\r\njustly remarked, there will scarcely be a definite season of vernal\r\nintermittent, but the remittent will commence immediately, increasing\r\nin extent and severity as the summer advances, and promising to\r\nbecome, in the autumn, the greatest season of disease that England\r\nhas known for this century.\r\n\r\nAs an example of this, it must suffice to enumerate two or three\r\nfacts, while these are as satisfactory for our purpose as a thousand\r\nwould be. The most general of these is, that ague is at this moment\r\nextremely abundant where it was formerly so little known as not to\r\nbe noticed, and that where single cases used to occur, there are now\r\nhundreds. Thus has it prevailed at Fulham and Ealing, and in the\r\noutskirts of London, and even in the town itself; and thus does it so\r\nprevail at Greenwich, Deptford, and in the associated vicinity, that\r\na medical friend informs us, that it comprises more than two-thirds\r\nof his entire practice, which is very extensive; whereas a few years\r\nago he had rarely a patient in a year. Thus also in the Military\r\nHospital at Woolwich, there were in the spring three hundred patients\r\nwith this disease; while in former times, we are assured, that an\r\nague was scarcely known once in five or six years.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the facts within our knowledge, but not one in\r\na thousand, which evince the necessity of the publication before\r\nus; a book which seems to have been singularly well-timed, in as\r\nfar as its purpose is, by a dissection of the sources of malaria,\r\nto diminish the ravages of both these kinds of fevers. And in this\r\nview we consider it a work of very considerable utility, inasmuch as\r\nit points out all the needful circumstances, as to prevention, in\r\ngreat detail; while these seemed particularly called for in England,\r\nfrom the entire and not less singular neglect which this subject has\r\nexperienced, not only from the people at large, but from the medical\r\nprofession. Beyond this, all that we need say of [p103] the character\r\nof the work is, that it contains the only regular and complete\r\nattempt at the natural history of Malaria that has been executed;\r\nsince the several foreign writings on this subject are partial, or\r\nimperfect, or local in their investigations; and having said thus\r\nmuch, we shall proceed to give a brief analysis of its form and\r\nmatter. And this analysis may be truly brief, without inconvenience;\r\nsince the two Essays from the pen of the author, to which we have\r\ngiven a place in our Journal, will supersede the necessity of making\r\nthat useful and practical abstract which we should otherwise have\r\nfelt ourselves bound to give.\r\n\r\nTo pass over an introductory chapter of the usual necessity, the\r\nauthor commences by pointing out the several disorders, in a general\r\nway, which are produced by malaria, for the purpose of proving the\r\nsources of this poison; and as we are of those who take the facts as\r\nalready proved, we need not notice it further.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter details the characters of those soils or situations\r\nwhich are most commonly or generally admitted to produce this poison:\r\nand though it contains some facts not very universally known, we\r\nshall also pass it over as of less moment than that which follows.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth chapter, containing the details of the\r\ncircumstances producing malaria, which have been either denied or\r\noverlooked; and it is one of the most important practical chapters in\r\nthe book, inasmuch as it is to the popular ignorance of these that\r\nwe must attribute a large proportion of the cases of fever occurring\r\nin common life. These, therefore, we shall mark briefly; and even\r\nthe briefest notice will be of use in the way of precaution, while\r\nwe must refer to the book itself for those proofs of the truth of\r\nthe several views, which we could not take room to give. Generally,\r\nhowever, we may state this leading argument of the author, because it\r\nis brief, and, to us, appears satisfactory. It is this: that as the\r\nquantity of the poison which any person can inspire is necessarily\r\nsmall, and as this small quantity can be produced by a small marshy\r\nspot as well as a large one, it is the same as to the production\r\nof disease, whether the marsh is a foot square or a mile, provided\r\nthe exposure be complete: while also, any piece of ground where\r\nvegetables decompose under the action of water, is virtually a marsh,\r\nor must produce malaria.\r\n\r\nThis enumeration, therefore, under that view, comprises, in addition\r\nto marshes, whether fresh or salt, all the cases where water is\r\npresent in such a manner as to act upon vegetables; and the chief are\r\nthe following. [p104]\r\n\r\nIt is shown, and by facts, that the rushy swamps of high moorlands,\r\nhowever small the extent, do produce this disease; and we must not\r\nhere forget to name what, however, belongs to the preceding chapter,\r\nwoods and coppices, little suspected in England, yet shown to be\r\nthe cause of fevers in Wales, and also in Sussex; very probably,\r\nevery where else. It is also shown that meadows and moist pastures,\r\nwhether in flat lands or on elevations, generate fevers; and very\r\nparticularly, should they have been affected by inundation or unusual\r\nmoisture, and if that should be followed by heat. And while it is\r\nalso specifically shown how, in all cases, it is the produce of\r\nthe drains or ditches required in meadow lands, it is distinctly\r\nproved that, even without these, malaria is produced, or that it is\r\ngenerated by the meadow or moist pasture itself.\r\n\r\nIt is also shown that this poison is produced by rivers, by all\r\nflat rivers at least, or those of which the progress is slow and\r\nthrough meadow lands; while this is pointed out as one of the causes,\r\nespecially, which is not suspected or not believed in England. And\r\nhere we can add a fact to our author’s statement, which is decisive:\r\nthis is the case of the barracks at Morne Bruce, in Dominica,\r\nsituated on a steep and rocky hill, perfectly dry, and free from\r\nall other causes of suspicion, while eternally subject to the most\r\nsevere fevers. And the cause is, a mountain stream, about 300 yards\r\nbelow this building, in the valley, always covered by a mist in the\r\nevenings, and ascertained, by direct experience, to be the very cause\r\nof the diseases in question.\r\n\r\nOur author also notices canals, mill-ponds, ornamental waters, and\r\nall other pools and ponds, even to so small a dimension as those\r\nformed in gravel-pits; pointing out those, in particular, as common\r\ncauses of fever about London, and apparently much inclined to pass\r\na very severe judgment on the canal in St. James’s Park, and also\r\non the pond in St. James’s Square, while apparently restrained by\r\nhis prudential reasons, which appear to us sufficiently misplaced,\r\nor, as we should fairly call them, somewhat absurd. But as we must\r\nnot affront a writer whose papers we have admitted, we shall say no\r\nmore on this matter. In noticing drains, he also speaks of moats and\r\nmodern fortifications; attempting to show that the fevers so common\r\nin the sieges of ancient castles were produced by their moats, and\r\nnoticing the familiar fact of the frequency of fevers in fortified\r\ntowns. Lakes also are pointed out as situations generating this\r\npoison: and it is here especially noticed that if, in those and other\r\ncases, malaria is produced by the vegetable growth and decomposition,\r\n[p105] so is it the consequence of the exposure of the mud of such\r\nreceptacles of water; a cause which is again treated of at greater\r\nlength in the subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nThis chapter relates to what the author calls obscure and disputed\r\ncases. We shall pass over these, which, as not implying precautionary\r\nmeasures, are of the least interest, and commence by noticing the\r\ncase of vegetable putrefaction. It is attempted to show, that the\r\nvegetable need not be living to produce malaria, but that, even if\r\nutterly decomposed, its elements, acting on water, can generate this\r\npoison. Among the cases under this head, are flax and hemp ponds,\r\ncommon sewers and drains, dunghills, and tide harbours; and the\r\nevidences under each are sufficient to make good the assertion. But\r\nthe most important of all, in our view at least, is bilge-water:\r\nsince our author has pretty clearly shown that all the fevers of\r\nships (excepting, of course, a few casual instances of contagion)\r\narise from this cause, and that if ships were kept clean, fever or\r\nsickness would be nearly unknown at sea. This we do indeed conceive\r\none of the most important points in the work before us; and if the\r\nauthor has referred to Sir Henry Baynton, as a stranger, we can quote\r\nhim, as a friend, that warrants for all that is here asserted, and\r\nfor far more; since his collection of facts on this subject is most\r\nimportant, and we think him almost culpable in not having long ago\r\ngiven them to the public. If the Leviathan was always the healthiest\r\nship in the navy; if she even left the West Indies, after a long\r\nanchorage and service, with a crew of 500 men, and not one sick, it\r\nis a case in the navy which never occurred before, nor since, and\r\nwhich arose entirely from the knowledge of this able and careful\r\nofficer respecting the subject that we are discussing.\r\n\r\nA sixth chapter explains, under the head of revolutions in the\r\nproduction of malaria, a variety of circumstances not easily\r\nadmitting of abridgment. The chief of these are, the effects produced\r\nby drainages, and reversely, those which arise from inundations or\r\nother incidental causes affecting the state of the soil. But the most\r\nimportant view which it contains is that which relates to the effect\r\nof embankment in rivers, and to the geological changes produced by\r\nthe distribution of alluvia. As, however, we cannot well state this\r\nin a small space, we shall pass to the chapter on the Propagation of\r\nMalaria.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest, and, as it strikes us, the most interesting\r\nof the whole; while the author has made it the depository of a\r\nvariety of remarks and recommendations on this [p106] subject, very\r\nparticularly as it relates to the army. If he is correct,—and we\r\nsee no reason to doubt it, from the nature of the statements,—the\r\nignorance of this subject, even among the medical department of the\r\narmy, has been most extraordinary and most unaccountable; while if\r\nWalcheren is proof enough of this, the writer before us has pointed\r\nout facts enough to show that it was not a solitary case, while\r\nevidently restrained by fear of some sort—we are almost inclined to\r\ncall it cowardice—from telling all that he might have told. And we do\r\nthink it wrong to retain or suppress that which is important to the\r\npublic safety, under a fear that the feelings of individuals may be\r\nhurt; since the business of a writer is with justice and utility, and\r\nthe security or welfare of thousands is of infinitely greater moment\r\nthan the comforts of a few, and those also culpable.\r\n\r\nUnder this head, propagation, the author describes how this poison\r\nis conveyed by the winds, while the facts add much to the number\r\nand variety of the precautionary measures. And here also we find\r\na speculation of no small curiosity, respecting the East wind,\r\nattempting to prove that wherever this is insalubrious or pernicious,\r\nit arises from its being the vehicle of malaria; while attempting\r\nalso to prove that this substance can be conveyed from Holland to\r\nthe coasts of England in that wind. We shall not pretend to give an\r\nopinion on this subject; and since the author himself has noticed\r\nit in the paper printed in our present number, we shall suffer our\r\nreaders to form their own judgments respecting it.\r\n\r\nOne also of the most curious facts mentioned in this chapter, is the\r\nsingular limitation of malaria; and we must admit that the instance\r\nquoted as to the Chatham road is so remarkable as to be almost\r\nincredible; though, as we find that all the people agree in it, we\r\ncannot pretend to say it is not a fact. Indeed the facts of this\r\nnature, so familiar at Rome, are fully as inexplicable; so that all\r\nwe can conclude is, that we are ignorant of the philosophy of this\r\nsubject: no very great cause of surprise, unless it were proved that\r\nwe could explain every thing else which belongs to meteorology.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth chapter we have an explanation of the effects of\r\nclimate and seasons in the production of malaria; and while we\r\nneed not analyse the facts which it contains, we may introduce in\r\nlieu of this, the explanations which its statements afford as to\r\nthat recent increase of the diseases of malaria which we noticed\r\nat the commencement of this article. The last few years have been\r\ndistinguished for an [p107] uncommon prevalence of East winds, and\r\nto such a degree indeed, that we can find no meteorological records\r\nat all to be compared with the history of these years. And while the\r\nhistory of the intermittent and remittent, in London at least, from\r\nthe time of Morton and Sydenham downwards, shows that all its periods\r\nof such diseases have been periods of East winds, it is not difficult\r\nto see how it acts as to both classes of marsh fever. To London,\r\nin particular, it is the best conductor, propagating the malaria\r\nfrom all the moist lands to the eastward. To the East coast, if our\r\nauthor’s theory is valid, it brings the malaria from Holland; and,\r\nmoreover, as it forms our hottest summers, it causes our own climate\r\nto approximate more to the southern ones, and thus enables our lands\r\nto produce a greater quantity of malaria than in ordinary summers.\r\n\r\nTo pass from the eighth chapter, the ninth is a partial sketch of\r\nthe geography of malaria; a chapter for which the author apologises,\r\nbut which is nevertheless a very interesting collection of facts\r\non a subject where a volume is, doubtless, a desideratum. And it\r\nwould require a volume; while, in spite of our author’s fears, we\r\ncan really see no reason why such a statistical account of health\r\nshould not be drawn up for England, when the utility of it is\r\nunquestionable. It is true that people cannot abandon their homes\r\nor change their residences, because their lots happen to be cast in\r\nan insalubrious country. But it is not less important to know what\r\nand where these dangers are; because, though the inhabitants may be\r\ncompelled to abide, they can still correct much of the evil by the\r\nvarious modes pointed out, or avoid much of the hazard by resorting\r\nto the obvious precautions. To be ignorant, is to be exposed to the\r\nfull evil: to know where it lies, is to know how and where to avoid\r\nit in numerous ways; since it will be found that by far the greater\r\nnumber of diseases occurring, were not necessary or unavoidable, but\r\nhave been the result of ignorance as to the precise fact or spot\r\nwhich did produce the effect in question. And this we conceive to\r\nbe the great use of the book before us; and that if ever it, or a\r\ncode of rules founded on it, shall become popular, or form a _vade\r\nmecum_, particularly in the country, the effect will be to reduce\r\nmost materially the quantity of disease, and very particularly that\r\nwhich is by far the most serious, the summer and autumnal fevers.\r\nOn this around, we should be glad to see a geography of malaria for\r\nEngland; and we do hope that it will be undertaken by some person\r\nof sufficient industry, and of more [p108] courage than our author;\r\nwhile we cannot doubt that whoever attempts it would at least find it\r\na profitable speculation. With these remarks we must pass over this\r\nchapter, as we could take no statement from it which would serve any\r\nuseful purpose; though, as far as it goes, it will form a very useful\r\nguide to travellers on the continent of Europe, or to those who, as\r\nemigrants, are in search of a residence abroad.\r\n\r\nThe tenth chapter examines the inquiries which have been instituted\r\ninto the chemical nature of malaria, leaving the question just where\r\nit was. In fact we, as chemists, do not believe that this science is\r\nyet in possession of the means required for analyses of this delicate\r\nnature; but we see no reason whatever why it should be despaired of,\r\nwhen chemistry has already, within a very few years, effected things\r\nwhich seemed far more impracticable and hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh and last chapter contains an enumeration of the\r\ndiseases produced by malaria, presenting a most formidable list, and\r\nabsolutely making us shudder in some of the details which relate to\r\nthe worst parts of France and Italy. The representation here given\r\nof the average of life in these districts is particularly striking;\r\nwhile of the truth of all the facts, we can speak from personal\r\nknowledge. Our author has also noticed the effect of this poison\r\non animals; showing that it is the cause of the noted epidemics in\r\ncattle, and also of the rot in sheep. If he will look into Livy, he\r\nwill find a confirmation, which he appears to have passed by when\r\nquoting that author for epidemic seasons: this being, that in the\r\nsame years in which epidemic “pestilences” appeared among the people,\r\nthere was also a great mortality among the cattle.\r\n\r\nWe do not know what his own profession will say of his attempt,\r\nor rather proposal, to prove that the celebrated disease of the\r\nnerves called Tic Douleureux is the produce of malaria and a mode of\r\nintermittent fever; nor how they will receive his proposal to arrange\r\nSciatica and Rheumatic pains, with many other local diseases, under\r\nthis head. But this is not our affair: and as he has promised us two\r\nother volumes, on all the diseases which are produced by malaria,\r\nincluding these, we must wait with patience; knowing at least that he\r\nis a dealer in facts and not in hypotheses, and expecting, that even\r\nif he should fail to establish his point, he will try to do it, as\r\nhe has been used to do in the other sciences which he has attempted,\r\nthrough the road of facts and evidence. [p109]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Account of a new Genus of Plants called_ REEVESIA. By John\r\n Lindley, Esq., F.L.S., &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a collection of dried specimens of plants sent to the\r\nHorticultural Society from China, by Mr. Reeves, are a few branches,\r\nwith flowers, of a remarkable genus which is at present undescribed,\r\nbut which is of so curious a nature, and of such importance with\r\nreference to the determination of some natural affinities, that I\r\nhave thought it deserving immediate record; especially as drawings\r\nof the fruit, which have been subsequently obtained from the same\r\nindefatigable correspondent of the Society, render its history\r\ntolerably complete.\r\n\r\nThe _branches_ appear to be fragments of an evergreen tree; they are\r\nslender, rounded, and smooth. The _nascent gemmæ_ are covered with\r\na dense rufous pubescence. The _leaves_ are alternate, becoming,\r\ntowards the extremities of the branches, opposite by approximation;\r\ntheir form is ovate-lanceolate acuminate, and in size they vary\r\nfrom three inches to nearly six in length; the surface, even of\r\nthe youngest, is perfectly smooth on each side; their veins are\r\ninconspicuous, the lowest pair of venæ primariæ being divergent at\r\nan angle of about 40°, while the others spread outwards at an angle\r\nof 55° or 60°; the venæ arcuatæ and externæ are obscurely seen,\r\nbut form together a number of rhomboidal spaces, equal in diameter\r\nto nearly one third of each side of the leaf; the proportion borne\r\nby the petiole to the lamina is variable, sometimes equalling\r\none-fourth of the length of the latter, and not unfrequently being\r\nless than one-sixth of its length: this proportion not depending\r\nupon the station of the leaves; the petiole is smooth, half-round,\r\nand thickened at the extremity, where it unites with the lamina.\r\n_Stipulæ_ are none. The _flowers_ are greenish-white, in terminal\r\nthyrsoid compound racemes; the upper part of the _rachis_, and of\r\nits branches, is slightly protected by stellate pubescence; the\r\n_pedicles_ are closely covered with pubescence of the same nature,\r\nand have one subulate downy deciduous bracteola at the base, and\r\nanother towards the apex. The _calyx_ is inferior, campanulate,\r\ntapering a little towards the base, densely clothed with stellate\r\npubescence, bursting irregularly at the apex into [p110] four or\r\nfive ovate teeth, which are somewhat imbricated during æstivation,\r\nbut which are separated by the growth of the petals long before\r\nthe expansion of the flower; the veins of the calyx are remarkably\r\nreticulated, and when cut, a considerable quantity of mucilaginous\r\nviscid fluid is exuded. The _petals_ are whitish-green, hypogynous,\r\nwith a convolute æstivation; their _ungues_ are spatulate, and as\r\nlong as the calyx; their _laminæ_ oblong, spreading flat, and then\r\noverlapping each other at the base; at the point of separation of\r\nthe unguis and lamina is a small callus, and on each side a notch\r\nupon the margin. The _stamens_ are seated upon a long, filiform,\r\nsubclavate, smooth torus; the _filaments_ are consolidated into a\r\ncapitate five-toothed cup, nearly closed at the orifice, and on\r\nthe outside of this cup are placed the _antheræ_, three to each\r\ntooth; the latter are two-celled, with divaricating cells, which\r\nopen longitudinally, and are so entangled with each other that the\r\nwhole surface of the cup appears, when the antheræ have burst, to\r\nconsist of a single many-celled anthera. The _pollen_ is spherical\r\nand smooth. he _ovarium_ is seated within the cup of stamens, and is\r\nso entirely concealed that it cannot be discovered till some part of\r\nthe cup is removed by violence; it is ovate, smooth, and formed of\r\nfive inseparable cells, each of which has two ovula placed one above\r\nthe other, and attached to their placenta by their inner margin; the\r\n_stigma_ is sessile, with five radiating lobes. From the Chinese\r\ndrawing, the half-ripe fruit appears to be fleshy, with five deep\r\nangles, and five cells, without any remains of calyx, and with a\r\nslight appearance of separation between the lobes. The ripe fruit\r\nis an obovate, five-angled, five-celled, five-valved, retuse, woody\r\ncapsule, with a loculicidal dehiscence, and no separable axis. The\r\nseeds are attached one to each side of the valves, and are expanded\r\nat their lower end into a wing.\r\n\r\nFrom this description it is obvious that, with the single exception\r\nof the contents of the seed, we are in possession of all that it is\r\nessential to know of the structure of this plant. The next subject of\r\nconsideration is its affinity.\r\n\r\nThe stellate pubescence, the thickening of the petiole at the point\r\nwhere it expands into the lamina, the station of the stamens upon a\r\nlong, filiform torus, the external position of the [p111] antheræ,\r\nand the union of the filaments by threes into a cup surrounding\r\nthe ovarium, are all characters that forcibly call to recollection\r\nthe genus Sterculia. The calyx, indeed, in that genus is generally\r\ndivided much more deeply than in the plant now under consideration,\r\nand the antheræ are usually seated at the base of the ovarium;\r\nbut, on the other hand, in Sterculia colorata of Roxburgh, which,\r\nif a distinct genus, (ERYTHROPSIS) as I am inclined to believe; is\r\nnevertheless next of kin to Sterculia, the calyx is of the same\r\nfigure and divided in the same degree, and the antheræ are also\r\ncombined in a capitate cup inclosing the ovarium. If, however, we\r\npursue this comparison further we find that, with the characters now\r\nadverted to, the similarity ceases; in Sterculia there are no petals,\r\nthe calyx has a valvular not imbricate æstivation, the cells of the\r\nfruit separate into distinct folliculi, and do not combine into a\r\nsolid woody capsule, and the seeds are destitute of wings.\r\n\r\nThe fruit suggests so obviously some affinity with Pterospermum,\r\nthat it is next necessary to institute a comparison with that\r\ngenus. Stellate pubescence, a calyx divided into five portions,\r\nfive hypogynous unguiculate petals, and fifteen fertile stamens\r\nunited into a cup, seated on a stipitiform torus, and surrounding\r\nthe ovarium, a five-celled ovarium, a woody five-celled capsule,\r\nwith a loculicidal dehiscence, no axis, and winged seeds; all these\r\ncharacters are common to Pterospermum and our plant; but on the\r\nother hand the points in which they differ are of much importance.\r\nThe æstivation of Pterospermum is valvate recurved not imbricate;\r\nits calyx is five-parted, not four—five-toothed; its anthers have\r\nparallel not divaricating cells, and are seated upon long distinct\r\nfilaments, not sessile, upon the outside of a capituliform cup; and\r\nfinally the petioles of the leaves are not connected with the lamina\r\nby a thickened space. The seeds are also winged at the apex, not at\r\nthe base, but upon this point it is not my wish to insist.\r\n\r\nIf the comparison thus instituted with Pterospermum and Sterculia be\r\nattentively considered, we cannot fail to remark that the subject of\r\nthese observations is nearly equally related to both; to Pterospermum\r\nin its petals and fruit, to Sterculia in its calyx and stamens.\r\nIt must, therefore, be stationed between those two genera, thus\r\nconfirming the propriety of M. [p112] Kunth’s combination of the\r\nSterculiaceæ of Ventenat with the Byttneriaceæ of Mr. Brown; and, in\r\nfact, breaking down every barrier between them.\r\n\r\nThere are many other points that will suggest themselves to the\r\nBotanist, in which this plant is highly worthy of consideration, but\r\nfor the present it will be enough to give the botanical characters\r\nwith which it may stand recorded. It is named in honour of John\r\nReeves, Esq., now resident at Canton, to whom we are indebted for\r\nour knowledge of it, from whose unwearied exertions in the cause of\r\nscience the botany of China has received material assistance, and to\r\nwhom our gardens are indebted for many of the fairest ornaments they\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n REEVESIA.\r\n\r\n _Ord.

The name of interference was given by\r\nDr. YOUNG to the law which he discovered, and of which he has made so\r\nmany ingenious applications.\r\n\r\nThis singular phenomenon, so difficult to be satisfactorily\r\nexplained in the system of emanation, is on the contrary so natural\r\na consequence of the theory of undulation, that it might have been\r\npredicted from a general consideration of the principles of that\r\ntheory. Every body must have observed, in throwing stones into a\r\npond, that, when two groups of waves cross each other on its surface,\r\nthere are points at which the water remains immoveable, when the\r\ntwo systems are nearly of the same magnitude, while there are\r\nother places in which the force of the waves is augmented by their\r\nconcurrence. The reason of this is easily understood. The undulatory\r\nmotion of the surface of the water consists of vertical motions,\r\nwhich alternately raise and depress the particles of the fluid. Now,\r\nin consequence of the intersection of the waves, it happens, that\r\nat certain points of their meeting, one of the two waves has an\r\nascending motion belonging to it, while the other tends at the same\r\ninstant to depress the surface of the liquid: consequently, when\r\nthe two opposite impulses are equal, it can neither be actuated by\r\none nor the other, but must remain at rest. On the contrary, at the\r\npoints in which the motions agree in their direction, and conspire\r\nwith each other, the liquid, urged in the same direction [p114] by\r\neach of the forces, is raised or depressed with a velocity equal\r\nto the sum of the effects of the two separate impulses, or to the\r\ndouble of either of them taken singly, since they are now supposed\r\nto be equal. Between these points of perfect agreement and complete\r\nopposition, which exhibit, one the total absence of motion, the other\r\nthe maximum of oscillation, there are an infinity of intermediate\r\npoints, at which the alternate motion takes place with more or less\r\nof energy, accordingly as they approach more or less to the places of\r\nperfect agreement, or of complete opposition of the two systems of\r\nmotion which are thus combined, or superinduced on each other.\r\n\r\nThe waves which are propagated in the interior of an elastic fluid,\r\nthough very different in their nature from those of a liquid like\r\nwater, produce mechanical effects by their interference, which are\r\nexactly of the same kind, since they consist in alternate oscillatory\r\nmotions of the particles of the fluid. In fact, it is sufficient that\r\nthese motions should be oscillatory, that is, that the particles\r\nshould be carried by them alternately in opposite directions, in\r\norder that the effects of one series of waves may be destroyed by\r\nthose of another series of equal intensity; for, provided that the\r\ndifference of the route of the two groups of waves [derived from the\r\nsame origin] be such, that for each point of the fluid the motions\r\nin one direction, belonging to the first series, correspond to the\r\nmotions, belonging to the second, in the opposite direction, they\r\nmust perfectly neutralise each other, if their intensity is equal:\r\nand the particles of the fluid must remain in repose. This result\r\nwill always hold good, whatever may happen to be the direction of the\r\noscillatory motion, with regard to that in which the undulations are\r\npropagated; provided that the direction of the oscillatory motion be\r\nthe same in the two series to be combined. In the waves which are\r\nformed on the surface of a liquid, for example, the direction of the\r\noscillation is [principally] vertical, while the waves are propagated\r\nhorizontally, and consequently in a direction perpendicular to the\r\nformer; in the undulations of sound, on the contrary, the oscillatory\r\nmotion is parallel to the direction of the propagation of the sound,\r\n[or rather is [p115] identical with it]; and these undulations, as\r\nwell as the waves of water, are subject to the laws of interference.\r\n\r\nThe undulations formed in the interior of a fluid have here been\r\nmentioned in a general manner: in order to form a distinct idea of\r\nthis mode of propagation, it must be remarked, that when the fluid\r\nhas the same density and the same elasticity in every direction,\r\nthe agitation produced in any point must be propagated on all sides\r\nwith the same velocity: for this velocity of propagation, which\r\nmust not be confounded with the absolute velocity of the particles,\r\ndepends only on the density and elasticity of the fluid. It follows\r\nthence that all the points, agitated at the same instant in a\r\nsimilar manner, must be found in a spherical surface, having for its\r\ncentre the point which is the origin of the agitation: so that these\r\nundulations are spherical, while the waves, which are seen on the\r\nsurface of a liquid, are simply circular.\r\n\r\nWe give the name of _rays_ to the right lines drawn from the centre\r\nof agitation to the different points of this spherical surface; and\r\nthese rays are the directions in which the motion is propagated.\r\nThis is the meaning of the term _sonorous rays_ in acustics, and of\r\n_luminous rays_ or _rays of light_ in the system which attributes the\r\nphenomena of light to the vibrations of a universal fluid, to which\r\nthe name of ether has been given.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the different elementary motions, of which each\r\nwave is composed, depends on the nature of the different motions\r\nwhich constitute the primitive agitation. The simplest hypothesis\r\nthat can be entertained concerning the formation of the luminous\r\nundulations, is, that the small oscillations of the particles of the\r\nbodies, which produce them, are analogous to those of a pendulum\r\nremoved but little from its point of rest; for we must conceive the\r\nparticles of bodies, not as immoveably fixed in the positions which\r\nthey occupy, but as suspended by forces which form an equilibrium\r\nin all directions. Now, whatever the nature of such forces may\r\nbe, as long as the displacement of the particles is but small in\r\nproportion to the extent of their sphere of action, the accelerating\r\nforce which tends to restore them to their natural position, and\r\nwhich thus causes them to oscillate on each side of it, may always,\r\nwithout sensible error, be considered as proportional [p116] to the\r\nmagnitude of that displacement: so that the law of their motion must\r\nbe the same as that of the motion of the pendulum, and of all small\r\noscillations in general. This hypothesis, which is suggested by the\r\nanalogy with other natural phenomena, and which is the simplest that\r\ncan be formed respecting the vibrations of the luminous particles,\r\nmay be considered as experimentally confirmed by the observation,\r\nthat the optical properties of light are all independent of any\r\ncircumstances which cause the greatest difference in the intensity of\r\nthe vibrations: so that the law of their motion must be presumed to\r\nbe the same for the greatest as for the smallest.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this hypothesis respecting the small oscillations,\r\nthat the velocity of the vibrating particle at each instant is\r\nproportional to the sine of an arc, representing the time elapsed\r\nfrom the beginning of the motion, taking the circumference for the\r\nwhole time required for the return of the particle to the same point,\r\nthat is, the time occupied by two oscillations, the one forwards\r\nand the other backwards. Such is the law according to which I have\r\ncalculated the formulas which serve to determine the effect of any\r\nnumber of systems of waves of which the intensities and the relative\r\npositions are given. These formulas will be found in the Annals of\r\nChemistry, vol. xi., page 254: [they may be applied with security to\r\nthe phenomena there considered, though the perfect accuracy of the\r\nhypothesis in all possible cases may be questioned, upon the grounds\r\nof the microscopical observations on the motions of vibrating chords,\r\npublished by Dr. Young in the Philosophical Transactions for 1800.\r\nTR.] Without entering into the details of the calculations, I think\r\nit necessary to show in what manner the nature of the undulation\r\ndepends on the kind of motion of the vibrating particles.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, in the fluid, a little solid plane which is removed\r\nfrom its primitive position, towards which it is urged by a force\r\nproportional to the distance. At the beginning of its motion, the\r\naccelerative force produces in it an infinitely small velocity only;\r\nbut its action continuing, the effects become accumulated, and the\r\nvelocity of the solid plane goes on continually to increase, until\r\nthe moment of its arrival at [p117] the position of equilibrium, in\r\nwhich it would remain, but for the velocity which it has acquired;\r\nand it is by this velocity only, that it is carried beyond the point\r\nof equilibrium. The same force which tends towards this point,\r\nand which now begins to act in a contrary direction, continually\r\ndiminishes the velocity, until it is completely annihilated; and then\r\nthe force continuing its action produces a velocity in the contrary\r\ndirection, which brings the plane back to its place of equilibrium.\r\nThis velocity again is very small at the commencement of the return\r\nof the particle, or plane, and increases by the same degrees as\r\nit had before diminished, until the instant of the arrival of the\r\nparticle at the neutral point, which it passes with the velocity\r\npreviously acquired: but when it has passed this point, the motion is\r\ndiminished more and more by the effect of the force tending towards\r\nit, and its velocity is reduced to nothing when it arrives at the\r\nplace of the commencement of the motion. It then recommences, at\r\nsimilar periods, the series of motions which have been described,\r\nand would continue to oscillate for ever, but for the effect of\r\nthe resistance of the surrounding fluid, the inertia of which\r\ncontinually diminishes the amplitude of its oscillations, and finally\r\nextinguishes them at the end of a longer or shorter time, according\r\nto circumstances. [It must not be inferred from this explanation,\r\nthat the particles of a fluid transmitting an undulation have any\r\ntendency to vibrate for ever: on the contrary it has been admitted by\r\nthe best writers on the theory of sound, that all the motions which\r\nconstitute it, as considered in a fluid, are completely transitory\r\nin their nature, and have no disposition to be repeated after having\r\nbeen once transmitted to a remoter part of the fluid. TR.]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider in what manner the fluid is agitated by these\r\noscillations of the solid plane. The stratum immediately in contact\r\nwith it, being urged by the plane, receives from it at each instant\r\nthe velocity of its motion, and communicates it to the neighbouring\r\nstratum, which it forces forwards in its turn, and from which the\r\nmotion is communicated successively to the other strata of the\r\nfluid; but this transmission of the motion is not instantaneous,\r\nand it is only at the end of a certain time that it arrives at a\r\ndeterminate [p118] distance from the centre of agitation. This\r\ntime is the shorter, as the fluid is less dense, and more elastic;\r\nthat is, composed of particles which possess a greater repulsive\r\nforce. This being granted, let us assume, in order to facilitate the\r\nexplanation, the moment when the moveable plane is returned to the\r\ninitial situation, after having performed two complete oscillations\r\nin opposite directions: at this moment, the nascent velocity, which\r\nit had at first, is transmitted to a stratum of the fluid removed\r\nfrom the centre of agitation by a distance which we may represent\r\nby _d_. Immediately afterwards, the velocity of the moveable plane,\r\nwhich has a little augmented, has been communicated to the stratum in\r\ncontact with it: “hence _it_ has passed successively through all the\r\nfollowing strata;” and at the moment when the first agitation arrives\r\nat the stratum of which the distance is _d_, the second has arrived\r\nat the stratum immediately before it. Continuing thus to divide, in\r\nour imagination, the duration of the two oscillations of the moveable\r\nplane into an infinity of small intervals of time, and the fluid\r\ncomprehended in the length _d_, into an equal number of infinitely\r\nthin strata, it is easy to perceive, by the same reasoning, that\r\nthe different velocities of the moveable plane, at each of these\r\ninstants, are now distributed among the corresponding strata; and\r\nthat thus, for example, the velocity which the plane possessed at the\r\nmiddle of the first oscillations in the direction of the motion, must\r\nhave arrived, at the instant in question, at the distance 3/4 _d_: so\r\nthat it is the stratum at this distance which possesses at the moment\r\nthe greatest direct velocity; and in the same manner when the plane\r\narrived at the limit of its first direct oscillation, its velocity\r\nwas extinguished, and the same absence of motion will be found at the\r\ndistance 1/2 _d_.\r\n\r\nIt is always supposed, that the oscillations of the plane are so\r\nminute in comparison with the length _d_, that their extent may\r\nbe neglected in this calculation: and this hypothesis is actually\r\nconsistent with the fact, since there is every reason to suppose\r\nthat the excursions of the incandescent particles are very small\r\nin comparison with the extent of an undulation, which, though an\r\nextremely minute space, is still an appreciable quantity, and may be\r\nactually measured. Besides, [p119] even if the amplitude of these\r\noscillations were not in the first instance so wholly inconsiderable,\r\nit would be sufficient to consider an undulation at a greater\r\ndistance from the centre of agitation, in order that their extent\r\nmight be diminished in any required proportion.\r\n\r\nIn the second, or retrograde oscillation, the plane, returning\r\nthrough the same space, must communicate to the stratum of fluid\r\nin contact with it, and to the rest in succession, a motion in\r\na direction contrary to that of the first oscillation; for when\r\nthe plane recedes, the stratum in contact with it, urged against\r\nthe plane by the elasticity or the expansive force of the fluid,\r\nnecessarily follows it, and fills up the vacuum which its retrograde\r\nmotion tends to produce. For the same reason, the second stratum is\r\nurged against the first, the third against the second, and so forth.\r\nIt is thus that the retrograde motion is communicated, step by step,\r\nto the most distant strata: its propagation is effected according to\r\nthe same law that governs the direct motion; the only difference is\r\nin the direction of the motions, or, in the language of mathematics,\r\nin the sign of the velocities which are imparted to the molecules\r\nof the fluid. We see then that the different velocities which have\r\nexisted in the solid plane, during its second oscillation, must exist\r\nat the moment which we are considering, in the different strata\r\ncomprehended in the other half of _d_, but with contrary signs. Thus\r\nthe velocity, for example, which the plane had in the middle of the\r\nsecond oscillation, which is its maximum of retrograde velocity, must\r\nnow be found in the fluid stratum situated at the distance 1/4 _d_\r\nfrom the centre of agitation, while the maximum of direct velocity is\r\nfound, at the same instant, in the stratum which is at the distance\r\n3/4 _d_ from the centre of agitation.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the fluid, agitated by the two opposite\r\noscillations of the solid plane, is what we call the breadth of\r\nan _entire undulation_, and we may consequently give the name of\r\n_semiundulation_ to each of the parts actuated by the opposite\r\nundulations; the whole constituting a _complete oscillation_, since\r\nit comprehends the return of the vibrating plane to the initial\r\nsituation. It is obvious, that the two semiundulations, which compose\r\nthe complete undulation, exhibit, in [p120] the fluid strata which\r\nthey contain, velocities absolutely equal in magnitude, but with\r\ncontrary signs, that is to say, carrying the particles of the fluid\r\nin opposite directions. These velocities are the greatest in the\r\nmiddle of each of the semiundulations, and decrease gradually towards\r\ntheir extremities, where they entirely vanish: so that the points\r\nof rest, and of the greatest velocities positive and negative, are\r\nseparated from each other by intervals of one fourth of an undulation.\r\n\r\nThe length of an undulation, _d_, depends on two things: first, on\r\nthe promptitude with which the motion is propagated in the fluid;\r\nand secondly, the duration of the complete oscillation of the\r\nvibrating plane; for the longer this duration, and the more rapid the\r\npropagation of the motion, the greater will be the distance to which\r\nthe first agitation has been extended at the instant of the return of\r\nthe solid plane to its initial situation. If the oscillations are all\r\nperformed in the same medium, the velocity of propagation remaining\r\nthe same, the length of the undulations will be simply proportional\r\nto the duration of the oscillations of the vibrating particles from\r\nwhich they originate. As long as the vibrating particles continue\r\nto be subjected to the same forces, it follows from the principles\r\nof mechanics that each of their minute oscillations will occupy the\r\nsame time, whatever their extent may be; so that the corresponding\r\nundulations of the fluid will continue to be of the same length; they\r\nwill only differ from each other in the greater or less extent of the\r\nelementary vibrations of the particles, which will be proportional\r\nto the extent of the luminous particles; for it appears from what\r\nhas already been stated, that each stratum of the fluid repeats\r\nexactly all the motions of the vibrating particle. The greater\r\nor less amplitude of the oscillations of the strata of the fluid\r\ndetermines the degree of absolute velocity with which they move, and\r\nconsequently the energy, but not the nature of the sensation which\r\nthey excite, which must depend, according to every analogy, upon\r\nthe duration of the oscillations. It is thus that the nature of the\r\nsounds, transmitted by the air to our ears, depends entirely on the\r\nduration of each of the oscillations executed by the air, or by the\r\nsonorous [p121] body which puts it in motion; and that the greater\r\nor less amplitude or energy of the oscillations only augments or\r\ndiminishes the intensity of the sound, without changing its nature,\r\nthat is, its tone, or pitch.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the light must depend then on the intensity of\r\nthe vibrations of the ether; and its nature, that is to say, the\r\nsensation of colour that it produces, will depend on the duration\r\nof each oscillation, or on the length of the undulation, the one of\r\nthese being proportional to the other. [We find, however, nothing in\r\nlight of the same colour that is at all analogous to the different\r\nregister, quality, or _timbre_ of a sound; by which, for instance,\r\nthe sound of a violin differs from that of a flute in unison with it:\r\nthe subordinate, or harmonic tones of the sound having nothing in\r\nlight to correspond with them. TR.]\r\n\r\nThe duration of the elementary oscillation remaining the same, the\r\nabsolute velocity of the ethereal particles, at the corresponding\r\nperiods of the oscillatory motions, is, as we have seen, proportional\r\nto its extent. It is the square of this velocity, multiplied by the\r\ndensity of the fluid, that represents what is called the living force\r\nin mechanics, or otherwise the energy or impetus of the particles,\r\nwhich is to be taken as the measure of the sensation produced, or of\r\nthe intensity of the light: thus, for example, if in the same medium,\r\nthe amplitude of the oscillation is doubled, the absolute velocities\r\nwill also be doubled, and the living force, or the intensity of the\r\nlight, will be quadrupled.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, take care not to confound this absolute velocity\r\nof the particles of the fluid with the velocity of the propagation\r\nof the agitation. The first varies according to the amplitude of\r\nthe oscillations; the second, which is nothing but the promptitude\r\nwith which the motion is communicated from one stratum to the other,\r\nis independent of the intensity of the vibrations. It is for this\r\nreason, that a weak sound is transmitted by the air with the same\r\nvelocity as a stronger one; and that the least intense light is\r\npropagated with the same rapidity as the brightest. When we speak\r\nof the velocity of light, we always speak of the velocity of its\r\npropagation. Thus, when we say that light passes through 200 thousand\r\n[p122] miles in a second, we do not mean, according to the undulatory\r\nsystem, that such is the absolute velocity of the ethereal particles;\r\nbut that the motion communicated to the ether employs only a second\r\nto pass to a stratum at the distance of 200 thousand miles from its\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the undulation becomes more distant from the centre\r\nof agitation, the motion, spreading over a greater distance, must be\r\nweakened in every part of the wave. It is shown by calculation, that\r\nthe amplitude of the oscillatory motion, or the absolute velocity\r\nof the particles concerned in it, is inversely proportional to the\r\ndistance from the centre of agitation. Consequently, the square\r\nof this velocity is inversely proportional to the square of the\r\ndistance, and the intensity of the light must be inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distance from the luminous point. It must be remarked,\r\nthat, for the same reasons, the sum of the living forces of the\r\nwhole undulation remains unaltered; for, on one side the length\r\nof the undulation _d_, which may also be called its thickness, is\r\ninvariable, and its extent of surface augmenting in proportion to\r\nthe square of the distance from the centre, the quantity, or mass of\r\nthe fluid agitated, is proportional to the same square: and since\r\nthe squares of the absolute velocities are diminished in the same\r\nproportion as the masses have augmented, it follows that the sum of\r\nthe products of the masses by the squares of the velocities, that\r\nis to say, the sum of the living forces, remains unaltered. It is a\r\ngeneral principle of the motion of elastic fluids, that however the\r\nmotion may be extended or subdivided, the total sum of the living\r\nforces remains constant; and this is the principal reason why the\r\nliving force must be considered as the measure of light, of which the\r\ntotal quantity always remains very nearly the same, at least as long\r\nas it continues to pass through perfectly transparent mediums.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, that black substances, and even the most\r\nbrilliant metallic surfaces, by no means reflect the whole of the\r\nlight which falls on them; bodies which are imperfectly transparent,\r\nand even the most transparent, when of great thickness, absorb also,\r\nto use a common expression, a considerable portion of the light that\r\nis passing through [p123] them: but it must not be inferred that\r\nthe principle of living forces is inapplicable to these phenomena;\r\nit follows, on the contrary, from the most probable idea that can\r\nbe formed of the mechanical constitution of bodies, that the sum\r\nof the living force must remain always the same, as long as the\r\naccelerating forces tending to bring the particles to their natural\r\npositions remain unchanged, and that the quantity of living force\r\nwhich disappears in the state of light, instead of being annihilated,\r\nis reproduced in the form of heat.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a correct idea of the manner in which the\r\noscillation of a small solid body occasions undulations in an elastic\r\nfluid, it has been only necessary to consider a complete oscillation\r\nof the solid plane, which produces an entire undulation. If we\r\nsuppose the oscillations of the plane to be continually repeated,\r\nwe shall have a series of undulations instead of a single one: and\r\nthey will follow each other without intermission, provided that the\r\nvibrations of the particle first agitated have been regular. Such a\r\nseries of regular and uninterrupted luminous motions I call a _system\r\nof undulations_.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to suppose, on account of the prodigious rapidity\r\nof the vibrations of light, that the luminous particles may\r\nperform a great number of regular oscillations in each of the\r\ndifferent mechanical situations in which they are placed during\r\nthe combustion or the incandescence of the luminous body, although\r\nthese circumstances may still succeed each other in extremely short\r\nperiods; for the millionth part of a second is sufficient to exhibit,\r\nfor example, 545 millions of undulations of yellow light; so that\r\nthe mechanical disturbances, which derange the regular succession\r\nof the vibrations of the luminous particles, or which even change\r\ntheir nature, might be repeated a million times in a second without\r\npreventing the regular succession of more than 500 millions of\r\nconsecutive undulations in each state of the particle. We shall soon\r\nhave occasion to apply this observation to the determination of the\r\ncircumstances in which the interference of luminous waves is capable\r\nof producing sensible effects.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that each undulation produced by an oscillatory motion\r\nwas composed of two semiundulations, which [p124] occasioned in the\r\nparticles of the fluids velocities exactly equal in their intensity,\r\nthough opposite in the direction of the motions. Let us at first\r\nsuppose that two whole undulations, moving in the same line and in\r\nthe same direction, differ half an undulation in their progress:\r\nthey will then be superinduced on each other through one half of\r\ntheir length, or of their breadth, as we should say in speaking\r\nof the waves of a liquid: but I here use in preference the term\r\nlength as applied to the interval between the two points which are\r\nsimilarly affected by the motions of two consecutive undulations.\r\nIn the supposed case of the coincidence of one half of each of the\r\nundulations, the interference will only take place with respect to\r\nthe parts so coinciding: that is, to the latter half of the first\r\nundulation, and the preceding half of the second: and if these two\r\nsemiundulations are of equal intensity, since they tend to give, to\r\nthe same points of the ether, impulses directly opposite, they will\r\nwholly neutralise each other, and the motion will be destroyed in\r\nthis part of the fluid, while it will subsist without alteration in\r\nthe two other halves of the undulations. In such a case, therefore,\r\nhalf of the motion only would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf now we suppose that each of these undulations, differing in their\r\nprogress by half the whole length of each, is preceded and followed\r\nby a great number of other similar undulations; then, instead of\r\nthe interference of two detached undulations, we must consider the\r\ninterference of two systems of waves, which may be supposed equal\r\nin their number and their intensity. Since, by the hypothesis, they\r\ndiffer half an undulation in their progress, the semiundulations of\r\nthe one, which tend to cause in the particles of ether a motion in\r\none direction, coincide with the semiundulations of the other, which\r\nurge them in the opposite direction, and these two forces hold each\r\nother in equilibrium, so that the motion is wholly destroyed in the\r\nwhole extent of these two systems of waves, except the two extreme\r\nsemiundulations, which escape from the interference. But these\r\nsemiundulations will always constitute a very small part of the whole\r\nseries to be considered.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning is obviously applicable to such systems only [p125]\r\nas are composed of undulations of the same length; for if the waves\r\nwere longer one than the other, however small their difference might\r\nbe, it would happen at last that their relative position would not\r\nbe the same throughout the extent of the groups; and while the\r\nfirst destroyed each other almost completely, the following ones\r\nwould be less in opposition, and would ultimately agree completely\r\nwith each other: hence there would arise a succession of weak and\r\nstrong vibrations analogous to the beatings which are produced by\r\nthe coincidence of two sounds differing but little from each other\r\nin their tone; but these alternations of weaker and stronger light,\r\nsucceeding each other with prodigious rapidity, would produce in the\r\neye a continuous sensation only.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that the impulse of a single luminous\r\nsemiundulation, or even of an entire undulation, would be too weak\r\nto agitate the particles of the optic nerve, as we find that a\r\nsingle undulation of sound is incapable of causing motion in a body\r\nsusceptible of a sympathetic vibration. It is the succession of the\r\nimpulse, which, by the accumulation of the single effects, at last\r\ncauses the sonorous body to oscillate in a sensible manner; in the\r\nsame manner as the regular succession of the single efforts of a\r\nringer is at last capable of raising the heaviest church bell into\r\nfull swing. Applying this mechanical idea to vision, supported as it\r\nis by so many analogies, we may easily conceive that it is impossible\r\nfor the two remaining semiundulations, which have been mentioned, to\r\nproduce any sensible effect on the retina; and that the result of\r\nsuch a combination of the two systems must be the production of total\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nIf again we suppose the second system of undulations to be again\r\nretarded half an undulation more, so as to make the difference of the\r\nprogress an entire undulation, the coincidence in the motions of the\r\ntwo groups will be again restored, and the velocities of oscillation\r\nwill conspire and be augmented in the points of superposition; the\r\nintensity of the light being then at its maximum.\r\n\r\nAdding another semiundulation to the difference in the progress of\r\nthe two systems, so as to make it an interval and [p126] a half, it\r\nis obvious that the semiundulations, superinduced on each other,\r\nwill now possess opposite qualities, as in the case of the half\r\ninterval first supposed: and that all the undulations must in this\r\nmanner be neutralised, except the extreme three semiundulations on\r\neach side, which will be free from interference. Thus almost the\r\nwhole of the motion will again be destroyed, and the combination of\r\nthe two pencils of light must produce darkness, as in the case first\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nContinuing to increase the supposed difference by the length of a\r\nsemiundulation at each step, we shall have alternately complete\r\ndarkness and a maximum of light, accordingly as the difference\r\namounts to an odd or an even number of semiundulations: that is,\r\nsupposing always that the systems of undulations are of equal\r\nintensity: for if the one series were less vivid than the other, they\r\nwould be incapable of destroying them altogether: the velocities of\r\nthe one series would be subtracted from those of the other, since\r\nthey would tend to move the particles of the ether in contrary\r\ndirections, but the remainders would still constitute light, though\r\nfeebler than that of the strongest single pencil. Thus the second\r\npencil would still occasion a diminution of the light: but the\r\ndiminution would be the less sensible as the pencil is supposed to be\r\nweaker.\r\n\r\nSuch are the consequences of the principle of the interference\r\nof undulations, which agree perfectly, as we have seen, with the\r\nlaw of the mutual influence of the luminous rays which is deduced\r\nfrom experiment: for the results are expressed precisely in the\r\nsame words, if we give the name of _length of undulation_ to the\r\ndifference of routes which had been represented by the symbol _d_.\r\nAdmitting, therefore, as there is every reason to believe, that light\r\nconsists in the undulations of a subtile fluid, the period _d_, after\r\nwhich the same effects of interference are repeated, must be the\r\nlength of an undulation.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the table already given for the seven principal\r\nkinds of coloured rays, that this period _d_, or the length of the\r\nundulation, varies greatly, according to the [p127] colour of the\r\nlight, and that for the extreme red rays, for example, it is [more\r\nthan] half as great again as for the violet rays situated at the\r\nother extremity of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be imagined that the number of different undulations is\r\nnot limited to the seven principal ones which are indicated in the\r\ntable, and that there must be a multitude of intermediate magnitudes,\r\nand others beyond the red and the violet rays: for the ponderable\r\nparticles, of which the oscillations give rise to them, must be\r\nsubjected to forces that are infinitely varied, in the combustion\r\nor the incandescence of the bodies which excite the motions of the\r\nether: and it is on the energy of these forces that the duration\r\nof each oscillation depends, and consequently the length of the\r\nundulation produced by it. It is found that all the undulations\r\ncomprehended [in the air] between the lengths .0000167 E.I. and\r\n.0000244, are visible; that is, are capable of exciting vibrations in\r\nthe optic nerve: the rest are only sensible by their heat, or by the\r\nchemical effects which they produce.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked, that when two systems of waves differ half\r\nan undulation in their progress, two of the semiundulations must\r\nescape from interference; that six must be exempt when the difference\r\namounts to three semiundulations; and that, in general, the number\r\nof undulations exempt from interference is equal to the number of\r\nlengths of a semiundulation separating the corresponding points of\r\nthe two systems. While this number is very small in proportion to\r\nthat of the waves contained in each system, the motion must be nearly\r\ndestroyed, as in the case of the exemption of a single undulation.\r\nBut it may be imagined that, as we increase the difference of\r\nthe progress of the two pencils, the undulations exempted from\r\ninterference may become a material portion of each group, and that\r\nit may finally become so great as to separate the groups entirely\r\nfrom each other; and in this case the phenomena of interference would\r\nno longer be observable. If, for example, the groups of undulations\r\nconsisted but of a thousand each, a difference of one-twentieth of an\r\ninch in their routes would be much more than sufficient to prevent\r\nthe interference of the rays of all kinds. [p128]\r\n\r\nBut there is another much more powerful reason which prevents our\r\nperceiving the effects of the mutual influence of the systems of\r\nwaves when the difference of their routes is considerable; which is\r\nthe impossibility of rendering the light sufficiently homogeneous:\r\nfor the most simple light that we can obtain consists still of an\r\ninfinity of heterogeneous rays, which have not exactly the same\r\nlength of undulation; and however slight the difference may be, when\r\nit is repeated a great number of times, it produces of necessity, as\r\nwe have already seen, an opposition between the modes of interference\r\nof the various rays, which then compensates for the weakening of some\r\nby the strengthening of others; [while the shades of colour are not\r\nsufficiently distinct to allow the eye to remark the difference.]\r\nThis is without doubt the principal reason why the effects of the\r\nmutual interference of the rays of light become insensible when the\r\ndifference of the routes is very considerable, so as to amount to 50\r\nor 60 times the length of an undulation.\r\n\r\nIt has already been laid down as one of the conditions necessary for\r\nthe appearance of the phenomena of interference, that the rays which\r\nare combined should have issued at first from a common source: and it\r\nis easy to account for the necessity of this condition by the theory\r\nwhich has now been explained.\r\n\r\nEvery system of waves, which meets another, always exercises on\r\nit the same influence when their relative positions are the same,\r\nwhether it originates from the same source or from different sources;\r\nfor it is clear that the reasons, by which their mutual influence\r\nhas been explained, would be equally applicable to either case. But\r\nit is not sufficient that this influence should exist, in order that\r\nit may become sensible to our eyes: and for this purpose the effect\r\nmust have a certain degree of permanence. Now this cannot happen when\r\nthe two systems of waves which interfere are derived from separate\r\nsources. For it is obvious that the particles of luminous bodies,\r\nof which the vibrations agitate the ether, and produce light, must\r\nbe liable to very frequent disturbances in their oscillations, in\r\nconsequence of the rapid changes which are taking place around them,\r\nwhich may [p129] nevertheless be perfectly reconciled, as we have\r\nseen, with the regular continuance of a great number of oscillations\r\nin each of the series separated by these perturbations. This being\r\nadmitted, it is impossible to suppose that these perturbations should\r\ntake place simultaneously and in the same manner in the vibrations\r\nof separate and independent particles; so that it will happen, for\r\nexample, that the motions of the one will be retarded by an entire\r\nsemioscillation, while those of the other will be continued without\r\ninterruption, or will be retarded by a complete oscillation, a change\r\nwhich will completely invert the whole effects of the interference of\r\nthe two systems of undulations which originate from them; since if\r\nthey had agreed on the first supposition, they would totally disagree\r\non the second. Now these opposite effects, succeeding each other with\r\nextreme rapidity, will produce in the eye a continuous sensation\r\nonly, which will be a mean between the more or less lively sensations\r\nthat they excite, and will remain constant, whatever may be the\r\ndifference of the routes described.\r\n\r\nBut the case is different when the two luminous pencils originate\r\nfrom a common source: for then the two systems of waves, having\r\noriginated from the same centre of vibration, undergoing these\r\nperturbations in the same manner and at the same instant, undergo no\r\nchanges in their relative positions: so that if they disagreed in the\r\nfirst instance at any given point, they would continue to disagree at\r\nall other times; and if their motions cooperated at first, they would\r\ncontinue to agree as long as the centre of vibration continued to be\r\nluminous: so that in this case, the effects must remain constant,\r\nand must therefore be sensible to the eye. This is therefore a\r\ngeneral principle, applicable to all the effects produced by luminous\r\nundulations; that in order to become sensible, they must be permanent.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto supposed that the two systems of waves were moving\r\nexactly in the same direction, and that consequently their elementary\r\nmotions, to be combined with each other, were precisely limited to\r\none single line: this is the simplest case of interference, and the\r\nonly one in which the one motion can be completely destroyed by the\r\nother: [p130] for in order that this effect may be produced, not only\r\nthe two forces must be equal and in contrary directions, but they\r\nmust also act in the same right line, or be directly opposed to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of coloured rings, and that of the colours developed\r\nby polarised light in crystallised plates, present a particular case\r\nof interference, in which the undulations are exactly parallel. But\r\nin the phenomena of diffraction, or in the experiment with the two\r\nmirrors, which has been already described, the rays which interfere\r\nalways form sensible though very small angles with each other. In\r\nthese cases the impulses to be combined with each other at the same\r\npoints, as belonging to the two systems of undulations, will also act\r\nin directions forming sensible angles with each other: but on account\r\nof the smallness of these angles, the result of the two impulses\r\nis almost exactly equal to their sum, when the impulses act in the\r\nsame direction, and to their difference, when they are in contrary\r\ndirections. Thus, in the points of agreement or disagreement, the\r\nintensity of the light will be the same as if the directions agreed\r\nmore perfectly; at least the nicest eye will not be able to discover\r\nany difference in them. But although, with respect to the intensity\r\nof the light, this case of interference resembles that which has\r\nalready been considered, there are other differences which modify the\r\nphenomenon very greatly, both with respect to its general form, and\r\nto the circumstances necessary for producing it.\r\n\r\nWe may take, as a convenient example, the case of diverging rays\r\noriginating from the same luminous point, and reflected by two\r\nmirrors slightly inclined to each other, so as to produce two pencils\r\nmeeting each other in a sensible angle: the two systems of waves\r\nwill then meet each other with a slight inclination; and it follows\r\nfrom this obliquity, that if a semiundulation of the first system\r\ncoincides perfectly in one point with a semiundulation of the second,\r\nurging the fluid in the same direction, it must separate from it to\r\nthe right and left of the point of intersection, and must coincide,\r\na little further off, on one side with the preceding semiundulation\r\nwhich is in a contrary direction, [p131] and on the other side with\r\nthe following semiundulation, and then be separated from this again,\r\nand at a distance twice as great as the first, must coincide with\r\nthe second semiundulation before and behind it, of which the actions\r\nwill coincide with its own: whence there will arise, on the surface\r\nof this undulation, a series of lines, at equal distances from each\r\nother, in which the motion is destroyed and doubled alternately by\r\nthe action of the second series. Thus if we receive this luminous\r\nundulation on a white card, we shall observe on it a series of\r\ndark and bright stripes, if the light employed is homogeneous; or\r\ncoloured fringes of different tints, if we employ white light for the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: untitled, diagram of two mirrors and reflected\r\n undulations]\r\n\r\nThis will be more easily understood by the inspection of a figure,\r\nwhich represents a section of the two mirrors and of the reflected\r\nundulations, formed by a plane drawn from the luminous point\r\nperpendicularly to the mirrors represented by DE and DF. The luminous\r\npoint is supposed to be S, and A and B are the geometrical positions\r\nof its two images, which are determined by the perpendiculars SA\r\nand SB falling from S on the mirrors, taking in them PA = SP [p132]\r\nand QB = SQ. The points A and B, thus found, are the centres of\r\ndivergence of the rays reflected from the respective mirrors,\r\naccording to the well known law of reflection. Thus, in order to\r\nhave the direction of the ray reflected at any point G of the mirror\r\nDF, for example, it is sufficient to draw a right line through B and\r\nG, which will be the direction of the reflected ray. Now it must be\r\nremarked, that, according to the construction by which the position\r\nof B is found, the distances BG and SG will be equal, and thus the\r\nwhole route of the ray coming from S and arriving at _b_, is the\r\nsame as if it had come from B. This geometrical truth being equally\r\napplicable to all the rays reflected by the same mirror, it is\r\nobvious that they will arrive at the same instant at all the points\r\nof the circumference _n′bm_, described on the point B as a centre,\r\nwith a radius equal to B_b_; consequently this surface will represent\r\nthe surface of the reflected undulation when it arrives at _b_, or,\r\nmore correctly speaking, its intersection with the plane of the\r\nfigure: the surface of the undulation being understood as relating\r\nto the points which are similarly agitated at the same instant: the\r\npoints being all, at the commencement of the whole oscillation, for\r\nexample, or at the middle or the end, completely at rest; and in the\r\nmiddle of each semioscillation, possessed of the maximum of velocity.\r\n\r\nIn order to represent the two systems of reflected undulations, there\r\nare drawn, with the points A and B for their centres, two different\r\nseries of equidistant arcs, separated from each other by an interval\r\nwhich is supposed equal to the length of a semiundulation. In order\r\nto distinguish the motions in opposite directions, the arcs on which\r\nthe motions of the ethereal particles are supposed to be direct, are\r\nrepresented by full lines, and the maximum of the retrograde motions\r\nare indicated by dotted lines. It follows that the intersections\r\nof the dotted lines with the full lines are points of complete\r\ndiscordance, and of course show the middle of the dark stripes; and,\r\non the contrary, the intersections of similar arcs show the points\r\nof perfect agreement, or the middle of the bright stripes. The\r\nintersections of the arcs of the same kind are joined by the dotted\r\nlines _b′p′_, _br_, _b′p′_, and those of arcs of [p133] different\r\nkinds by the full lines _n′o′_, _no_, _no_, _n′o′_: these latter\r\nrepresenting the successive positions or the trajectories of the\r\nmiddle points of the dark stripes, and the former the trajectories of\r\nthe bright bands.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to magnify very greatly in this figure the real\r\nlength of the luminous undulations, and to exaggerate the mutual\r\ninclination of the two mirrors, so that we must not expect an exact\r\nrepresentation of the phenomenon, but merely a mode of illustrating\r\nthe distribution of the interferences, in undulations which cross\r\neach other with a slight inclination.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to deduce from geometrical considerations, that the length\r\nof these fringes is in the inverse ratio of the magnitude of the\r\nangle made by the two pencils which interfere, and that the interval,\r\ncomprehended between the middle points of two consecutive dark or\r\nbright bands, is as much greater than the length of the undulation,\r\nas the radius is greater than the sine of the angle of intersection.\r\n\r\nIn fact the triangle _bni_, formed by the right line _bi_, and the\r\ntwo circular arcs _ni_ and _nb_, may be considered as rectilinear\r\nand isosceles, on account of the smallness of the arcs; and the\r\nsine of the angle _bni_, considered as very small, may be called\r\n_ib_/_bn_: so that _bn_ being the radius, _ib_ will represent the\r\nsine of the angle _bni_, which has its legs perpendicular to those\r\nof the angle A_b_B: consequently, these angles being equal, one of\r\nthem may be substituted for the other; and representing by _i_ the\r\nangle A_b_B, formed by the reflected rays, we have _bn_ = _ib_/sin\r\n_i_; consequently _nn_, which is twice _bn_, will be equal to\r\n2_ib_/sin _i_. But _nn_ is the distance between the middle points\r\nof two consecutive dark stripes, and is the distance which has\r\nbeen called the breadth of a fringe; and _ib_ being the breadth\r\nof a semiundulation, according to the construction of the figure,\r\n2_ib_ will be that of a whole undulation; consequently the breadth\r\nof a fringe may be said to be equal to the length of an undulation\r\ndivided by the [numerical] sine of the angle made by the reflected\r\nrays [p134] with each other, which is also the angle under which the\r\ninterval AB would appear to an eye placed at _b_. We find another\r\nequivalent formula, by remarking that the two triangles, _bni_ and\r\nA_b_B, are similar, whence we have the proportion _bn_: _bi_ = A_b_\r\n: AB, and _bn_ = (_bi_ × A_b_)/AB, or 2_bn_ = (2_bi_ × A_b_)/AB:\r\nwhich implies that we may find the numerical breadth of a fringe\r\nby multiplying the length of an undulation by the distance of the\r\nimages A and B from the plane on which the fringes are measured, and\r\ndividing the product by the distance of the two images.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to inspect the figure, in order to be convinced of\r\nthe necessity of having the two mirrors nearly in the same plane, if\r\nwe wish to obtain fringes of tolerably large dimensions; for in the\r\nlittle triangle _bni_, the side _bi_, which represents the length of\r\na semiundulation, being little more than the hundred thousandth of an\r\ninch for the yellow rays, for example, the side _bn_, which measures\r\nthe half breadth of a fringe, can only become sensible when _bn_\r\nis very little inclined to _in_, so that their intersection may be\r\nremote from _ib_; and the inclination of _bn_ to _in_ depends on the\r\ndistance AB, which is the measure of the inclination of the mirrors.\r\n\r\nIf A and B, instead of being the images of the luminous point, were\r\nthe projections of two very fine slits cut in a screen RN, through\r\nwhich the rays of light were admitted from a luminous point placed\r\nbehind the screen in the continuation of the line _b_DC, the two\r\npaths described between the point and the slits A and B being equal,\r\nit would be sufficient to compute the paths described by the rays,\r\nbeginning from A and B, in order to have the differences of their\r\nlengths; and it is obvious in this case, that the calculations which\r\nwe have been making of the breadth of the fringes, produced by the\r\ntwo mirrors, would remain equally applicable, at least as long as\r\neach slit remained narrow enough to be considered as a single centre\r\nof undulation, relatively to the inflected rays which it transmits.\r\nIt may therefore be said that the breadth of the fringes, produced\r\nby two very fine slits, is equal to the length of an undulation\r\nsupposed [p135] to be multiplied by the interval between the two\r\nslits, and divided by the distance of the screen from the wires of\r\nthe micrometer employed for measuring the fringes.\r\n\r\nThis formula is also applicable to the dark and bright stripes which\r\nare observed in the shadow of a narrow substance, substituting the\r\nbreadth of this substance for the interval which separates the two\r\nslits, as long as the stripes are far enough from the edges of the\r\nshadow: for when they approach very near to the edges, it is shown,\r\nboth by theory and by experiment, that this calculation does not\r\nrepresent the facts with sufficient accuracy; and it is not perfectly\r\ncorrect in all cases, either for the fringes within the shadow, or\r\nfor those of the two slits, but only for the fringes produced by the\r\nmirrors, which exhibit the simplest case of the interference of rays\r\nslightly inclined to each other. In order to obtain from the theory,\r\na rigorous determination of the situation of the dark and light\r\nstripes in the two former cases, it is not sufficient to calculate\r\nthe effect of two systems of undulations, but those of an infinite\r\nnumber of similar groups must be combined, according to a principle\r\nwhich will shortly be explained, in treating of the general theory of\r\ndiffraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n ii. _Rule for the Correction of a_ LUNAR OBSERVATION. _By_ Mr.\r\n WILLIAM WISEMAN, _of Hull_.\r\n\r\n RULE.\r\n\r\nAdd together the reserved logarithm (found as directed, page 111 and\r\n112 of the Appendix to the third edition of the Requisite Tables) the\r\nlog. sines of half the sum, and half the difference of the apparent\r\ndistance, and difference of apparent altitudes, and 0.3010300, the\r\nlog. of 2.

Par W. F. Edwards,\r\n D.M., Membre associé de l’Académie royale de Médicine de Paris,\r\n Membre de la Société Philomatique, de la Société de Médicine de\r\n Dublin, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe researches of science among the phenomena of the physical world\r\nhave long obtained a high degree of estimation and interest in\r\ngeneral society; but it is of late years only that their application\r\nto living functions has attracted much of the attention of the\r\nliterary world.\r\n\r\nThe laws which govern the action of animal organs (the proper\r\ndepartment of Physiology) have usually been investigated by the\r\nmedical profession, to which they especially [p138] refer. Now\r\nwe find the public take some pains, and with reason, to inform\r\nthemselves upon subjects connected with physiological knowledge. A\r\nwell-educated person, disposed to philosophical inquiries, is not\r\nmerely contented with the consciousness of living, and the common\r\ninformation he derives of its means by experience, but he seeks also\r\nto comprehend the relations subsisting between his own organisation\r\nand the matters with which he is surrounded, and which at once\r\nfurnish him with nutrition, life, and support, and assail him with\r\ndisease and annihilation. His own instincts and observation, joined\r\nto the more learned experience of his medical advisers, help him\r\nthrough the precarious stages of life, and these may perhaps be\r\nsufficient for all its purposes; and under this impression many will\r\nseek to know no more of the secrets of nature.\r\n\r\nBut we live in an inquiring and scrutinising age, when the demand\r\nfor scientific principles is very generally urgent. All, therefore,\r\nrelating to organisation seems of equal interest with that\r\nappertaining to what is termed the physical creation or inert matter.\r\n\r\nUnder this impression we have perused the book before us with great\r\nsatisfaction, and propose to present our readers with an analysis of\r\nthe valuable materials which it contains. We have some knowledge of\r\nDr. Edwards, a countryman domiciliated in France, and long resident\r\nin Paris. We have confidence in his reports, and highly estimate\r\nhis philosophical skill, extensive acquirements, and accuracy of\r\nobservation, ranking him among the first physiologists of the age.\r\n\r\nThe work, now under consideration, contains an elaborate account\r\nof a long series of experiments, instituted for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the influence of the physical agents upon animal life.\r\nThese agents comprehend the atmospheric air, water, and temperature;\r\nthe two first constituting the media in which all animals exist, and\r\nthe last influencing in common the inhabitants of both media. It\r\nis true, this is a subject by no means new, for it has engaged the\r\nattention of experimenters from the earliest days of science. But\r\nDr. Edwards has diligently and patiently sought to investigate the\r\nsubject himself, to correct previous errors, and to embody the facts\r\nwhich he has accumulated into a more complete and regular system than\r\nheretofore adopted. In this attempt he has been eminently successful,\r\nand has effected more perhaps than all who preceded him, availing\r\nhimself, nevertheless, of the experience of former inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe extent of his book, and the number of the experiments [p139]\r\nare indeed somewhat appalling, but his clear and distinct method of\r\narrangement greatly facilitates the reader’s endeavours to master the\r\nextensive subjects of his pages. As a book of reference it should\r\nfind a place in the library of every scientific society, and no\r\nindividual devoted to philosophy should omit the possession of it.\r\n\r\nThe agency of the air around us, water, and heat and cold, have\r\noften been the objects of _chemical_ inquiry, from their known\r\ngreat influence upon the animal economy. The changes effected by\r\nthe phenomena of animal life upon these agents have been accurately\r\nexamined, and partly reduced to a mathematical precision of\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani and others have viewed the subject as it regards\r\nphysiology, but with such results as left the field open to\r\nsubsequent investigation. Dr. Edwards seems to have seized upon the\r\ndeficiencies of his predecessors, and, by going over their ground,\r\nand extending his own inquiries, he has arrived at most interesting\r\nand important results. These he has divided into four parts, as they\r\nrelate to the different orders of the animal creation. The first\r\npart includes some of the lower animals, particularly tenacious of\r\nlife, and of cold blood, such as frogs, toads, and salamanders. The\r\nsecond part is devoted to other animals of cold blood, and of the\r\nvertebrated order, as fish, and those reptiles which include lizards,\r\nsnakes, and turtles. The third part refers to warm-blooded animals;\r\nand the fourth part of the work is dedicated to the influence of the\r\nphysical agents upon the human race and vertebrated animals. To these\r\nthe author has added the discoveries of modern times, relative to\r\nelectricity on the animal economy, in an Appendix. A collection of\r\ntables is appended to the work, exhibiting the principal series of\r\nhis experiments, as they regard the relative influence of physical\r\nagents on the duration of life, and the phenomena resulting from\r\ntheir mutual action.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the four grand divisions of the work forbids\r\nour hastily reviewing them, and we will endeavour to condense so much\r\nof the information they contain as may forward the objects of our\r\nanalysis. Dr. Edwards thus announces the arrangement of his work:—\r\n\r\n “Ces recherches auront donc rapport à l’air dans les conditions de\r\n quantité, de mouvement et de repos, de densité et de raréfaction;\r\n à l’eau liquide et à la vapeur aqueuse; à la température, dans ses\r\n modifications de degré et de durée; à la lumière et à l’électricité.\r\n Ces causes agissent à la fois sur l’économie animale, ordinairement\r\n d’une manière sourde et imperceptible; et toujours [p140]\r\n l’impression qu’on reçoit est le résultat de toutes ces actions\r\n combinées.”\r\n\r\n “Lors même que, par l’intensité de l’une d’elles, il nous arrive de\r\n distinguer la cause qui nous affecte, l’observation de l’effet se\r\n borne le plus souvent à la sensation, et les autres changemens qui\r\n l’accompagnent nous échappent. On conçoit par la que l’observation\r\n la plus attentive des phénomènes tels que la nature nous les\r\n présente, ne saurait démêler dans cette combinaison d’actions\r\n l’effet propre à chaque cause, ni reconnaître des effets qui ne\r\n seraient pas révélés par la sensation.\r\n\r\n “Il est une méthode qui règle les conditions extérieures, qui fait\r\n varier celle dont on veut apprécier l’action, et qui fait juger,\r\n par la correspondance entre ce changement et celui qui survient\r\n dans l’économie, du rapport de cause et d’effet: c’est la méthode\r\n expérimentale; c’est celle que j’ai suivie. Pour en tirer parti il\r\n fallait, d’une part, déterminer l’intensité de la cause, d’autre\r\n part celle de l’effet. La physique nous fournit ordinairement les\r\n moyens de remplir la première indication.”\r\n\r\nIn the true spirit of philosophical investigation, Dr. Edwards, in\r\nthe first place, proceeds to examine the action of physical agents\r\nupon the simplest forms, and least elaborately developed organised\r\nbeings, extending his inquiries upwards, in the scale of the animal\r\nworld, to man, the most perfect creature, and the ultimate object of\r\nall physiological researches.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of constitution belonging to cold-blooded reptiles,\r\namong which there is so little mutual dependance of organs, renders\r\nthese the best tests of the relative and proportionate influence\r\nof the different agents, the intense action of which is liable to\r\ndestroy the more perfect animals; and the great development of the\r\nnervous system in the higher orders gives them a wider and more\r\nacute range of sensibility. It is difficult, at all times, and often\r\nimpossible, to insulate corporeal functions among the warm-blooded\r\nclasses, so as to ascertain the amount and limits of physical agency.\r\nThe four classes of vertebrated animals, or such as are furnished\r\nwith true spines, afford ample means of comparative illustrations;\r\nand these departments have engaged the author’s attention, in order\r\nto display the result of the action of the same agent exercising a\r\nuniform influence upon constitutions very differently constructed.\r\nThe _air_, for example, exercises its influence uniformly upon he\r\nfour mentioned classes of vertebratæ, and their different families\r\nare similarly exposed to the action of the atmosphere by respiration.\r\n\r\nCurious and interesting as is this subject, it is singular [p141]\r\nthat, while it was among the first to be noticed, it has been\r\nthe latest in producing satisfactory results. Among the opposing\r\ncauses of the advancement of knowledge in this department, the\r\nignorance of our ancestors in _chemical_ science seems to be the\r\nprincipal. Without chemical aid it is perfectly useless to attempt\r\nthe investigation. The composition of the air respired must be well\r\nunderstood; the different gases must be carefully examined, or the\r\nphysiological inquiry will be darkened and obscured.\r\n\r\nDr. Priestley laid the foundation of our chemical knowledge of\r\ngases in their relation to respiration; but some time elapsed\r\nbefore it was understood in what manner the air was connected with\r\nanimal organisation. Oxygen gas, one of the known constituents of\r\natmospheric air, was Priestley’s discovery, in its effect upon the\r\nblood, of converting this fluid from a dark purple to a bright\r\ncrimson. Lavoisier founded a chemical theory upon this discovery\r\nof the agency of air, which was subsequently applied by Goodwin to\r\nphysiology. The latter author demonstrated, by a series of excellent\r\nand correct experiments, that the exclusion of atmospheric air\r\nproduces death in animals, in consequence of the dark-coloured blood\r\nusually circulating in the veins being prevented from becoming\r\ncrimsoned. The state in which any animal may be thus placed, is known\r\nby the term ASPHYXY, and by which is to be understood a deficient\r\nor suspended aërification of the blood, from whatever cause it may\r\nproceed that the atmospheric air is prevented from access to the\r\nblood as it circulates through the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe great French anatomist, Bichat, pursued this subject still\r\nfarther, and published a treatise on Asphyxy. He sought, by numerous\r\nexperiments, to determine the threefold relation of the air to the\r\nnervous system, respiration, and the circulation; and he arrived at\r\nthis great and important conclusion, that the VENOUS OR DARK BLOOD\r\nCIRCULATING THROUGH THE BRAIN, CREATES A CESSATION OF THE FUNCTIONS\r\nOF THAT ORGAN, AND THAT IN CONSEQUENCE THE HEART LOSES ITS ACTION.\r\nThis discovery shows us at once the direct cause of asphyxy in all\r\nits different degrees, according, in effect, to the vitiated state of\r\nthe blood from its deficient or suspended aërification.\r\n\r\nLe Gallois also investigated the subject of asphyxy; and he found\r\nthat, when _dark blood circulated through the spinal marrow, the\r\nmotions of the heart ceased_; and thus he not only determined the\r\nrelations of the nervous system to atmospheric air, but also those of\r\nthe respiration and the circulation, [p142] explaining the action of\r\nthe air upon animals physiologically.\r\n\r\nIn this inquiry warm-blooded animals were almost exclusively referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani certainly investigated the action of the air on animals\r\nof cold blood, but less in relation to the three grand objects of\r\nBichat and Le Gallois; and Spallanzani had the misfortune to live in\r\nan age when neither chemistry nor physiology had made such advances\r\nas the present age has produced.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Humboldt and Provençal have, indeed, supplied much of this\r\ndeficiency, by their researches into the respiratory functions of\r\nfishes. Nevertheless, the ground was still open, and our author has\r\njustly appreciated the extent of former inquiries, and observed that\r\nthe phenomena of cold-blooded animals were too extraordinary to be\r\nnoticed lightly, and required much more extensive observation than\r\nwas previously bestowed upon them. With this impression, he proceeded\r\nto form an estimate of the comparative influence of the air and water\r\nupon the nervous and muscular systems of cold-blooded animals, which\r\nthe singular modifications of life among reptiles in particular\r\nafford ample means of ascertaining.\r\n\r\nWe know that these animals possess the extraordinary property\r\nof existing a considerable time after the removal of the heart,\r\nwith the free exercise of their senses and of voluntary motion,\r\nnotwithstanding the suppression of the circulation. Dr. Edwards\r\naccordingly selected _salamanders_ for his first investigations,\r\nand removed the heart, with the bulb of the aorta. Two of these\r\nwere exposed to the free action of the air, and the other two were\r\nsubmersed in water previously deprived of air by boiling; a similar\r\ntemperature being maintained in each medium. In four or five hours,\r\nthose submersed in the non-arëated water ceased to be active, unless\r\nirritated, when they still appeared to retain voluntary power. One\r\ndied in eight, and the other in nine hours. The salamanders in air\r\nlived from twenty to twenty-six hours and upwards. These comparisons\r\nwere frequently repeated, and upon frogs and toads, with the same\r\nresults, showing the experiments in air to be far more favourable\r\nto their existence than with the animals submersed in the water.\r\nEight hours were about the maximum of the duration of life among\r\nthe animals submersed in the water, and twenty-nine among those\r\nexposed to the air; so that, independently of respiration, the air\r\nis thus proved to be the most proper [p143] medium for the action of\r\ntheir nervous and muscular systems, in their insulated state, the\r\nrespiration and the circulation of the blood being both suspended. As\r\na further corroboration of the superior vivifying property of the air\r\nover simple water, when the same animals were plunged into unaërated\r\nwater during a certain time, as soon as they were, removed into the\r\natmosphere, they instantly revived; and their nervous and muscular\r\nsystems were acted on according as they were placed in either medium.\r\nDr. Edwards also confirmed the observation of Goodwin relative to\r\nthe effect produced on the colour of the blood. Properly speaking,\r\nthe asphyxy comes on the instant the air is excluded, the shades of\r\ndifference in the colour of the blood being referrible to the air\r\nleft in the lungs after cessation of respiration.\r\n\r\nThe next point to determine was the influence of the air upon the\r\nsame animals exercising the respiratory function, and retaining their\r\ncirculation, compared with those deprived of these functions.\r\n\r\nThe difference of time in the two cases developes the influence which\r\nthe general circulation of the blood, free from aërial contact,\r\nexercises upon the nervous system.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain this point, an equal number of frogs, deprived of the\r\npower to exercise their respiratory and circulating functions,\r\ntogether with others left entire, were respectively plunged into\r\ndisaërated water. At times the difference in favour of the untouched\r\nanimals was twenty-four hours in favour of the duration of life.\r\nSimilar trials with toads and salamanders produced the same results.\r\nIn each case _asphyxy_ came on; but the existence of the animals\r\nwhich lived without the respiration and circulation was much\r\nshortened. Thus the relative powers of life between the sole and\r\ninsulated action of the nervous system, and its action combined with\r\nthe circulation of dark blood, were estimated. The inference to be\r\ndeduced, therefore, is, that although disaërated blood furnishes\r\nbut an ephemeral sort of existence, it nevertheless exercises a\r\ncomparatively favourable influence upon the nervous and muscular\r\nsystems, since it tends to the prolongation of the action of these\r\nanimal functions.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards next proceeds to investigate the phenomena of _asphyxy_\r\nproduced by _strangulation_, or the mechanical obstruction to the\r\naccess of air to the lungs, and consequently to the blood. The same\r\nanimals were employed. When the windpipe was rendered impervious by\r\nligature, the muscles of the animals seemed to be paralysed directly;\r\nand although their motions became subsequently revived at times,\r\n[p144] they never altogether recovered their perfect freedom. As a\r\ncomparative illustration, an equal number of frogs were submersed\r\nin water, all of which died in about ten or eleven hours, while\r\nthose which were strangled lived from one to five days. Salamanders\r\ncontinued active longest, and one did not cease to exist till the\r\neleventh day, although during this time he was in a complete state of\r\n_asphyxy_ from perfect strangulation.\r\n\r\nDumeril once found that a salamander lived a long time after\r\ndecapitation, even when the cicatrix of the wound was healed so as to\r\nstop all access of air to the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the effects of strangulation with those of submersion\r\nor drowning, it is to be supposed either that these animals exist a\r\nlimited period without the necessity of the nervous system being in\r\ncontact with atmospheric air, or that the air influences their blood\r\nthrough the integuments of the body. Accordingly Dr. Edwards put this\r\nto the test by making experiments upon _cutaneous respiration_.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani found that the exposure of cold-blooded animals to the\r\nair was attended with exudation of _carbon_, a phenomenon similar\r\nto that of respiration. There appears, however, to be some source\r\nof error in these experiments, for Spallanzani removed the lungs,\r\nand this operation rendered the animal liable to the absorption of\r\nair and loss of blood. Dr. Edwards sought to effect the same purpose\r\nby a different and more successful measure. He also confined frogs\r\nin vessels of atmospheric air, and fastened bladders round the head\r\nand neck, tight enough to stop the entrance of air to the lungs. At\r\nthe expiration of two hours the air was examined in the bladder,\r\nand it was found to contain an excess of _carbonic acid_. The same\r\nresult was obtained from salamanders. It appears, therefore, that\r\nwhile air is in contact with the skin, _carbon_ is given out; but\r\nwhether this be the effect of exhalation merely, or that _oxygen_ is\r\nactually absorbed, and _carbon_ transpired, is a question which led\r\nto further inquiries. Dr. Edwards, therefore, inclosed cold-blooded\r\nanimals in _solid substances_, in order to determine the influence of\r\ndark-coloured blood, free of all external agency, in the production\r\nof chemical changes, and to observe its sensible effect upon the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1779 three toads were confined in a box hermetically\r\nsealed, and so deposited in the Academy of Sciences. Eighteen months\r\nafter, the box was opened, and one toad was found dead. These animals\r\nhave been found alive in blocks of coal after an imprisonment of some\r\nyears, and have [p145] also been sealed up during similar periods\r\nwithout perishing. Possibly some hole or crevice might have admitted\r\na little air. But, in Hevissant’s experiment of 79, care seems to\r\nhave been taken to obviate this suspicion.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards, however, determined to put the question to the test.\r\nHe enclosed ten out of fifteen frogs in thick wooden boxes, and\r\nfilled the interstices with plaster, covering them over with the\r\nsame substance, the toads lying each in a central hole or bed. The\r\nother five toads were at the same time submersed in water, and at\r\nthe expiration of eight hours they were found to be dead. In sixteen\r\nhours more, one toad was taken from a box and found to be lively, and\r\nwas reconsigned to its prison. On the sixteenth day the toads in the\r\nboxes were discovered alive, and thus the fact was established that\r\nthese animals can live far longer in a state of asphyxy confined in\r\nsolid substances, than when submersed in water. This was confirmed by\r\nrepeated trials on salamanders, frogs, and toads. The frogs perished\r\nquickest.\r\n\r\nThus an extraordinary fact is established, as regarding reptiles,\r\nsince it affords an exception to the general rule that _all animals\r\nrequire a_ CONSTANT _supply of fresh air for the maintenance of their\r\nexistence_.\r\n\r\nSimilar trials were repeated in sand, and with the same results.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards found that although a certain quantity of air enters the\r\nboxes and sand, yet that it is far too little to maintain life. His\r\nconclusion, therefore, stands, that animals of the kind employed can\r\nlive longer in _solid substances_ than in a limited quantity of _dry\r\nair_.\r\n\r\nIt remains, however, to be considered in what manner these animals\r\nhave their lives extended beyond those exposed to the action of a\r\nbody of air. Dr. Edwards supposes the _moisture_ of the sand to be\r\none cause, since in the dry air the animals become _desiccated_, the\r\ncutaneous transpiration being lost in one case, and retained in the\r\nother, by the exclusion of air. A rapid and abundant transpiration\r\nfrom the body, united with deficiency of air, seems to be a greater\r\ncause of dissolution than confinement in solid substances wherein\r\nthere is no waste by transpiration.\r\n\r\nThe author’s inquiries are next directed to the influence of\r\n_temperature_ upon animals of cold blood, and two and forty\r\nexperiments are practised upon this subject, from the month of July\r\nto September following, during which period frogs were submersed\r\nin aërated water, with a view of settling the duration of life,\r\nacted on by varieties of temperature. The [p146] continuance of\r\nlife, generally, in these experiments, varied from one to two hours\r\nand twenty-seven minutes. The mean term of life was one hour and\r\nthirty-seven minutes, as averaged in July, and in September one hour\r\nand forty-five minutes, the two extremes of the seasons approximating\r\nthe effects. The duration of the frog’s existence was greatest in the\r\ngreatest depression of temperature. Thus at ten degrees the duration\r\nof life was more than double what occurred at sixteen or seventeen\r\ndegrees, and at zero it was about triple. As the heat was increased,\r\nthe duration of life was diminished; at forty-two the frogs died, and\r\nin the lowest temperature they lived longest.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that at zero the frogs did not become stiffened, but\r\nretained their motion, and their resistance to the frozen state is\r\nthe cause of the continuance of their existence at a low temperature.\r\nThe cause of this resistance is to be found in their peculiarity of\r\nconstitution. Toads produced similar results.\r\n\r\nIt may be alleged that frogs naturally live in climates at from forty\r\nto forty-two; but, it is to be observed, that they are then placed in\r\na situation of liberty to come to the surface of the water to respire\r\nwhen they please; whereas in these experiments their respiration is\r\nlimited, from their inability to reach the surface.\r\n\r\nTaking a wider range of temperature, Dr. Edwards sought to ascertain\r\nthe influence of the _seasons_. In July and September frogs were\r\nfound to live from one to two hours and twenty-seven minutes in\r\naërated water at fifteen and seventeen degrees. In November they\r\ndied at the end of more than double this period, under the same\r\ntemperature, and all other circumstances being similar excepting the\r\nseason. As the autumn advanced life was prolonged.\r\n\r\nTo what are we to ascribe the modifications of the seasons? Probably\r\nto circumstances appertaining to the intensity of light, to\r\nelectricity, to temperature, to the pressure of the atmosphere, to\r\ndryness and moisture, &c.? Such existing causes naturally suggest\r\nthemselves. But it appears that little or no account can be rendered\r\nas to pressure, since its variations were too trifling during the\r\ntwo seasons. Moisture could not effect an influence, because the\r\nexperiments were performed in water. The motion of the air was also\r\nobviated. Of all the suggested modifications _temperature_ alone\r\nacted, and this, as it related to the surrounding air, was rendered\r\nineffectual by artificial temperature. The animals, therefore,\r\ncould only be affected as to the temperature of the [p147] seasons\r\n_by that which preceded the experiments_. The modifications of the\r\nseasons, therefore, appeared to influence the cold-blooded animals\r\nused in the experiments in this point of view only. Accordingly we\r\nhave this remarkable result, that the animals lived twice as long in\r\nautumn as in the summer preceding, when plunged in water of equal\r\ntemperature. The _seasons_ evidently influence their constitutions,\r\nso as to extend the duration of life independently of other causes,\r\nthat is, from summer to autumn. Dr. Edwards endeavoured to ascertain\r\nif it proceeds from atmospheric temperature, and he found that frogs\r\nlived in aërated water at ten degrees, during November, from five\r\nor ten to eleven, and even to forty hours, in some instances, the\r\nlast term being about double the duration of life in water of the\r\nsame degree in summer. This proves the remarkable dependence of the\r\nfrog’s life under water, and the temperature of the month preceding.\r\nTwo curious facts are thus developed by experiments instituted at\r\ndifferent seasons. First, the influence of the temperature of the\r\nwater in which the animals were placed; and secondly, the influence\r\nof the temperature of the air during certain periods preceding the\r\nexperiments, for in autumn the duration of life was about double\r\nthat of summer, and in winter he found the term to equal autumn,\r\nthe temperature of the air being in each comparative experiment\r\nartificially raised to the same degree.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the foregoing experiments that frogs, toads,\r\nand salamanders, exist in water according to its _lowness of\r\ntemperature_, and that their lives are prolonged _by the temperature\r\nwhich precedes the experiment being lowered_. It then becomes a\r\nquestion, what are the limits of this influence? This is to be\r\nascertained by observing the greatest duration of life among animals\r\ndeprived of external air by submersion in water; and noticing at\r\nthe same time all the favourable circumstances dependent on the\r\nconcurrent temperature in prolonging life among the cold-blooded\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nA point relative to the natural history of frogs first presents\r\nitself to our notice. Spallanzani is of opinion that frogs do not\r\npass the winter under water, but retire in October from their native\r\nrivers into moist sands, in which they make openings to breathe the\r\nair through, called by the Italian fishermen _il respiro della ranà_.\r\n\r\nM. Bose, and other French naturalists, found that frogs retire from\r\nOctober to spring _into water_, but they give us no direct proof that\r\nthey constantly remain submersed. The presence of the observer may\r\nalarm the frogs, and thus prevent [p148] their putting their heads\r\nabove the water, so that the assertion is but a negative kind of\r\nproof that they remain so long under the water without coming up to\r\nrespire, as some affirm. M. Bose declares he watched frogs approach\r\nthe surface at regular periods every day during the winter season.\r\nUnder the most favourable circumstances Dr. Edwards found that frogs\r\ncould not remain submersed, in winter, more than two days and a half.\r\nFrogs are less active during winter than at the other seasons, but\r\nthey never lose their motion. Were it true, as Spallanzani thinks\r\nit is, that they remained so long under water, it is probable that\r\nthey would become frozen in winter and die. Spallanzani derives\r\nhis opinion from what occurs with fish, forgetting that frogs are\r\namphibious, and live as well on land as in water; whereas fish are\r\nlimited to a watery medium, and can, therefore, furnish no example.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards found that frogs, placed in certain quantities of aërated\r\nand non-aërated water of an equal temperature, lived longest in the\r\n_former_; but that the difference was not constant in its results,\r\nbeing often twice as long in one case as in the other, as to the\r\nduration of life.\r\n\r\nThe next inquiry regarded _stagnant water renewed at intervals_, and\r\nin this the duration of life was prolonged beyond the term of the\r\nlast experiments, and even to eight days. During winter when the\r\ntemperature was lowest the frogs remained active, though less so than\r\nin spring.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions to be drawn from these experiments are, that frogs\r\npass the winter _in an animated state in water_, not becoming\r\nstiffened as in ice, and that they need not to approach the surface\r\nof the water in order to respire, provided the water they inhabit\r\nbe _renewed at intervals_; but if the water be not renewed, or if\r\ndisaërated water be employed, the frogs perish.\r\n\r\nConsidering that these animals are truly amphibious, these results\r\nare very curious; and it is interesting in a physiological point of\r\nview, to know that frogs are able to respire the air contained in the\r\ndense medium of water for an indefinite period, and just as easily as\r\nthey breathe the finer medium on land.\r\n\r\nRespecting the action of aërated water on the skin, the conclusion\r\ndrawn seems to be correct, that it must be from _cutaneous_\r\nabsorption that the air contained in the water promoted the\r\ncontinuance of life in Dr. Edward’s experiments upon this point,\r\nsince the animals were in a state of _asphyxy_ regarding respiration\r\nby the lungs; and that no [p149] air entered in combination with\r\nwater was shewn from Dr. Edwards _never having seen water in the\r\nlungs_. Therefore, unless the air acted on the blood through some\r\nother organ, the lives of these animals would be definite and\r\nshortened, even though the water be renewed from time to time, and\r\ntheir _asphyxy_ would be complete and continued. And since the skin\r\nis the only organ in contact with the air, it is fair to conclude\r\nthat it is the medium of aërial absorption.\r\n\r\nWhen the _webs_ were examined under water, these membranes indicated\r\nthe action of air upon their blood-vessels, by the bright tint of the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani imagined that frogs perish sooner in _running_ than\r\nin _stagnant_ water; but Dr. Edwards having secured some of these\r\nanimals in ten feet of the Seine, whilst others were simultaneously\r\nplaced in _unrenewed stagnant water_, he found the latter did not\r\nsurvive many hours, and the former lived a long time.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix the limits of this kind of existence, frogs were\r\nplaced in _renewed aërated water_, and with a temperature never\r\nforced beyond ten degrees they were found to live _in all seasons\r\nof the year_; but when the temperature was elevated from twelve to\r\nfourteen, they died in a few hours. In running streams they lived\r\nlongest, and at twelve degrees they were thus more favourably placed\r\nthan in stagnant water, _at a lower temperature even_, and taking\r\nthe precaution to renew the water daily; and at seventeen degrees\r\nin running water they died prematurely. Toads exhibited the same\r\ncomparative results, but they lived the longest.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that water contained in vessels is less\r\nfavourable to the lives of these animals than running streams,\r\nalthough the water and the temperature were identical. Probably the\r\ngreat advantage of running water is its _constant and unceasing\r\nrenewal_. The separate and comparative influence of air, water,\r\nand temperature, being thus investigated, the combined action\r\nof the three physical agents was next inquired into, and it is\r\ndemonstrated that frogs submersed in water are influenced by three\r\ncircumstances,—1. the presence of _air_ in water; 2. the quantity of\r\nits renewal; 3. the _temperature_ of the medium. If the manners of\r\nfrogs be closely examined, they appear to live in water under very\r\nconsiderable influence from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFrom circumstances developed in the foregoing experiments, _cutaneous\r\nrespiration_ seems to be pretty evidently indicated. A chapter is,\r\ntherefore, devoted to this subject, one that is not well known,\r\nalthough pulmonary respiration is [p150] generally understood. In\r\nfrogs, the function of pulmonary respiration is united with that\r\nof deglutition, and the air enters only by the nostrils, the mouth\r\nbeing closed during respiration. While the mouth remains open, the\r\naction of deglutition is stopped, and, therefore, the animal does\r\nnot then breathe. Dr. Edwards availed himself of this circumstance\r\nby gagging the mouth so as to keep it open, and thus prevent the\r\nair from entering the lungs. The frogs were sufficiently exposed to\r\nmoisture and renewal of air to their bodies: the results were, that,\r\nat twenty-four degrees, five frogs so placed died next day, and one\r\nlived a week.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards immersed some frogs in wet sand, and adopted an improved\r\nmethod of excluding air from the lungs, and some of them lived\r\ntwenty days. Hence it evidently appears that air influences the\r\nskin materially, and counterbalances the asphyxious state induced\r\nby obstructing the air’s passage to the lungs. By adopting other\r\nmethods, the existence of frogs was prolonged to thirty or forty\r\ndays. It is, therefore, sufficiently proved that the blood undergoes\r\nits necessary changes from atmospheric influence through the medium\r\nof the skin, although in a minor degree compared with those which it\r\npasses through from pulmonary respiration. Frogs are thus shewn to\r\npossess a double source of respiration.\r\n\r\nBy substituting _oil_ for water, frogs immersed in this fluid died\r\nin a few hours, being at liberty to breath the air on its surface.\r\nAnd, when plunged into oil, with the means of breathing by the lungs\r\narrested, they lived an equal time with frogs simultaneously placed\r\nin water without power to respire. A comparison was instituted with\r\nfrogs in oil and in water, being allowed to breathe air, when the\r\ndifference was found to be very considerable in favour of the aquatic\r\nbath. These circumstances shew, that, even with the feeble succour of\r\nthe air through the skin, absorbed from the water, the respiratory\r\nfunction was far more prolonged, than in the case of the obstruction\r\nafforded by the oil. Thus we have abundant evidence of the double\r\nfunction by which frogs are maintained, from the action of the air on\r\nthe skin and the lungs; and this appears to be the means of existence\r\namong _amphibious animals generally_.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why these animals die in deep water when prevented\r\nfrom approaching the surface? It appears that, having expelled the\r\nrespired air from their lungs, which is imperfectly renewed from the\r\nwater, they become specifically heavier than the water, and unable to\r\nrise from the bottom; and thus placed, the duration of their lives\r\ndepends upon [p151] the resistance offered by their constitutions\r\nto the depressing effects of a state of asphyxy while remaining\r\nsubmersed.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards next proceeds to inquire into the effects of\r\nTRANSPIRATION. A liquid transfusion from the skin of animals is\r\nconstantly going on, either in the form of vapour or of fluid in a\r\ndenser state.\r\n\r\nThe latter constitutes sweat. This phenomenon exhibits great\r\nvariations, and it is important to know what diminution of weight the\r\nbody suffers in different circumstances. In the course of an hour\r\nremarkable fluctuations occur.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards suspended frogs, toads, and salamanders, in a _calm air_,\r\nweighed them, and noted the results, which, though very changeable\r\nin an hour, were generally uniform in three, and in nine hours they\r\naveraged an equal result. The successive diminution in the mass of\r\nfluids was evident.\r\n\r\nThe results were modified by the alternate position of the animals in\r\na body of air in repose, or agitated by a draft. And these results do\r\nnot appear to depend upon any principle of vitality, for they take\r\nplace equally in death and in life, and indeed among unorganized\r\nbodies, as, for example, lumps of charcoal soaked in water. Therefore\r\nthe cause of the phenomenon of transpiration seems to be referrible\r\nentirely to physical agents. The _motion of the air_ seems to be its\r\nexciting cause; for even when, to all appearance, it is calm, it is\r\nin reality agitated more or less, and produces a sensible evaporation\r\nfrom the skin. But the difference between the effect of calm and\r\nagitated air is remarkable; for in a draft, the animals exposed to\r\nit sweated away double the quantity of liquid compared with those\r\nconfined in a room shut up. The amount lost was proportioned to the\r\n_intensity of the wind_, and reached a triple amount over those\r\nanimals in stagnant air; and this fact explains the variations\r\nnoticed from hour to hour among animals exposed to currents of air.\r\n\r\nThe transpiration which occurs in very moist air, always amounts to a\r\ndiminution of weight; but in dry air it is five or ten times greater;\r\nand when the influence of a moist state of the atmosphere is compared\r\nwith that of a dry state, the amount of evaporation is equal to that\r\nof a dry and calm air.\r\n\r\nTranspiration may, therefore, be referred to _the agitation of the\r\natmosphere_ for its exciting cause, beyond any modifications of its\r\n_density_. And, although an elevated temperature be favourable to\r\ntranspiration, its modifying influence is less than that of other\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the effects of _absorption_ and _transpiration_, [p152]\r\nin water and in air, frogs were found to gain an addition to their\r\nweight according to the term of their continuance in the former\r\nmedium. An absorption of water was rendered evident by the loss of\r\nbulk it had sustained, when measured after the experiment.\r\n\r\nThus, when the comparative influence of water and air is estimated,\r\nthe former appears to be absorbed, and adds to the weight of the\r\nbody; and the latter tends to diminish the weight, by different and\r\nfluctuating degrees of evaporation taking place, and dependent much\r\nmore on the degree of motion in the air, than on its dryness or\r\nhumidity: these last conditions modify evaporation in a minor degree,\r\nwhen compared with the influence of a current of air.\r\n\r\nThe celerity of _absorption_ exceeds that of _transpiration_ six\r\ntimes, in the most rapid cases. It therefore results, that the losses\r\nby _transpiration_ in air should be repaid by absorption of water\r\nin a much less time than the expenditure occurs. But the decrease\r\nof weight is not prolonged; it is sudden, and not continuous,\r\nalternating with augmentation of weight, by absorption of liquid\r\ngoing on in a ratio superior to the loss; and thus nature’s provision\r\nis manifested for the nutriment of the body.\r\n\r\nWith this last inquiry Dr. Edwards concludes the first part of\r\nhis work; and it is observed, that, with regard to transpiration,\r\nthe losses of weight have been considered without reference to\r\nthe existence of any other influence than water. The losses by\r\ntranspiration have been examined generally without regard to the\r\nmatters lost. What relates to water differs essentially in one\r\nrespect from that which regards the air. The losses sustained by the\r\nbody ought to be more particularly examined. Temperature and loss of\r\ntime require estimation. An excretion of _solid_ matter evidently\r\ntakes place; for the water, in which animals are submersed, becomes\r\nturbid, especially in hot weather, and it sensibly contains animal\r\nmatters, affecting the weight of the body in water.\r\n\r\nWhen animals are submersed in water, their skins exercise two\r\nfunctions, acting inversely in determining their weight. And it\r\nresults, from comparative experiments, that the _absorption at\r\nzero_ exceeds the _loss in water_; while at thirty degrees the\r\n_loss_ exceeds the increase by weight from absorption; and the\r\nhigher the temperature, the greater is the excess in the discharge\r\nof animal matters. We may therefore presume, that the agency of\r\n_temperature_ produces analogous effects, upon aërial transpiration,\r\nto those before observed [p153] in other inquiries; and the effects\r\nof _dryness_ and _moisture_ in the air produce a minor degree of\r\ninfluence also, when compared with _temperature_, on the losses of\r\nanimal substances.\r\n\r\nWe have been thus minute in our analysis, because the subject of\r\nit is new to science in its present shape, and of a high degree of\r\ninterest. Dr. Edwards’s researches among the different classes of\r\nanimals have tended more to the illustration of the influence of\r\nphysical agents upon life than any previous authorities; and the\r\npersevering industry, accuracy of observation, and patient inquiry\r\nwhich he has evinced in his investigations among cold-blooded\r\nanimals, have placed this department of the creation in a point of\r\nview at once curious, interesting, and valuable to science. We attach\r\nthe greater importance to this part of the author’s work, as it is\r\na ground on which he may be consulted, and quoted as indisputable\r\nauthority, until equal inquiries have shewn him to be fallacious.\r\n\r\nOur limits will not at present permit us to proceed farther in our\r\nanalysis, and we must refer the remainder of the book to a future\r\nopportunity. The subjects of the three other parts, though greatly\r\nextended, will not probably require such minute analysis as those\r\nnovel experiments which form the subject of the first part; but we\r\nimagine that the application of the principles laid down, in the\r\nprevious inquiries, to human physiology, will be found not less\r\ninteresting than those which relate to the natural history of the\r\nlower orders of the animal creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Account of Professor Carlini’s Pendulum Experiments on Mont\r\n Cenis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that no account of Professor Carlini’s pendulum\r\nexperiments on Mont Cenis has hitherto appeared in the periodical\r\nscientific publications of this country: the experiments are,\r\nhowever, well deserving of such notice, having been conducted with\r\ngreat care, and having had a specific object in view, which object\r\nseems to have been satisfactorily accomplished. The following\r\nbrief account of them, taken from the original memoir published in\r\nthe Appendix to the “Ephéméride di Milano” for 1824, may not be\r\nunacceptable to those of our readers who interest themselves in\r\nsubjects of this class.\r\n\r\nThe length of the simple pendulum vibrating seconds is a [p154]\r\nmeasure of the intensity of gravitation; _i. e._ of the excess of the\r\nforce of gravity over the centrifugal force. In consequence of the\r\nellipticity of the earth, and of the difference in the direction of\r\nthe two forces, the intensity of gravitation varies according to the\r\ndifferent latitudes. It also varies, in the same latitude, according\r\nto the greater or less elevation of the pendulum above the level of\r\nthe sea; _i. e._ according to its greater or less distance from the\r\ncentre of the attracting force.\r\n\r\nHad the earth a perfectly level surface, such, for instance, as\r\nit would have if it were everywhere covered by a fluid, the force\r\nof gravity, in receding from the surface, would diminish in the\r\nduplicate proportion of the distance from the earth’s centre. In the\r\nactual state of the globe, however, its continents and its islands\r\nare raised above the general level of the sea by which it is only\r\npartially covered; and if a pendulum be raised, on the surface of\r\nthe land, to a known elevation above the sea, the diminution of\r\ngravity will not be, as in the more simple case, proportioned to the\r\nsquares of the respective distances from the earth’s centre, but that\r\nproportion will require to be modified, by taking into account the\r\nattraction of the elevated materials, interposed between the general\r\nsurface and the place of observation.\r\n\r\nWhen pendulums are employed in different latitudes, to obtain the\r\nratio of gravitation between the equator and the pole, for the\r\npurpose of deducing the ellipticity of the earth, all the places\r\nof observation, being on land, are more or less elevated above the\r\nsea; inland stations, in particular, are sometimes at considerable\r\nelevations: to render these results comparable one with another,\r\nit is necessary to reduce each result to what it would have been,\r\nhad it been made at some level common to all the experiments; and\r\nthe surface of the sea has hitherto been taken as that common\r\nlevel. Previous to the publication of a paper of Dr. Young’s in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1819, the consideration which we have\r\nmentioned, that of the attraction of the matter interposed between\r\nthe place of observation and the level of the sea, was generally\r\nunheeded in estimating the allowance to be made for the reduction\r\nof different heights to the common level: in that paper, however,\r\nDr. Young took occasion to point out the probable effect of [p155]\r\nthe interposed matter in modifying considerably the usual allowance;\r\nthat, supposing its density to be about half the mean density of\r\nthe earth, the effect of an hemispherical hill of such matter, on\r\nthe summit of which the pendulum should be placed, would be to\r\ndiminish the correction, deduced from the duplicate proportion from\r\nthe earth’s centre, about 1/5th; that, in like manner, a tract of\r\ntable-land, considered as an extensive flat surface, of the same\r\nrelative density, would diminish the correction about 3/8ths; and\r\nthat, accordingly, in almost any country that could be chosen for\r\nthe experiment, the proper correction for the height would vary,\r\naccording to the form and density of the interposed materials, from\r\nrather more than a half to rather less than three-quarters of the\r\nusual allowance. This view has been subsequently acted upon by the\r\nEnglish pendulum experimentors, in reducing their observations;\r\nbut it has not been yet adopted by the French. The experiments of\r\nProfessor Carlini were calculated to afford a practical illustration\r\nof the correctness of Dr. Young’s reasoning.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carlini was engaged, in the summer of 1821, in concert\r\nwith Professor Plana, in determining the amplitude of the celestial\r\narc between the Hospice on Mont Cenis and the Observatory at Milan,\r\nby means of fire-signals made on the Roche Melon, and observed\r\nsimultaneously at Milan and at a temporary observatory established\r\nat the Hospice. Whilst thus engaged, Professor Carlini, being\r\nstationary for several days on Mont Cenis, and obliged to have time\r\nvery accurately determined, for the purpose of comparing with the\r\nobservatory at Milan, availed himself of the opportunity to employ\r\na pendulum apparatus of the same general nature as that used by M.\r\nBiot at Paris, which had been prepared at Milan some years before,\r\nunder the direction of a commission of weights and measures, with the\r\nview of determining the value of the divisions of the national linear\r\nscale. As this apparatus differed in some few particulars from the\r\noriginal employed in France, we shall briefly notice the differences,\r\npresuming our readers to be acquainted with the apparatus of MM.\r\nBorda and Biot.\r\n\r\n1. In the Milan apparatus, by means of two microscopes furnished with\r\nwire micrometers, the length of the pendulum [p156] may be measured\r\nwithout touching it; without approaching it; without even opening the\r\ncase which contains it. The measure is obtained by bringing the wires\r\nin contact with the images of the knife-edge suspension, and of the\r\nupper and lower borders alternately of the platinum disk suspended to\r\nthe thread: thus preventing the risk of deranging the equilibrium,\r\nand avoiding the effect which the heat of the body might have on the\r\ndilatable metallic thread.\r\n\r\n2. The half sum of the distances taken between the suspension, and\r\nthe upper and lower edges of the disk, gives the distance of the\r\ncentre of the disk itself; without measuring its diameter with a\r\ncompass, an operation exceedingly difficult to execute with the\r\nnecessary precision. By this apparatus of microscopes the length may\r\nbe measured at pleasure, even during the time of oscillation; and\r\nbeing attached to the wall, instead of supported by the floor, the\r\nrisk of derangement by the tread of the observer is avoided.\r\n\r\n3. The pendulum, and the clock by which its oscillations are\r\nmeasured, were not, as usually, near together and resting on the\r\nsame base, but were perfectly separated. The coincidences of the\r\noscillations were observed, by bringing the image of the pendulum of\r\nthe clock, reflected by means of an oblique mirror, in contact with\r\nthe image of the simple pendulum seen direct through a telescope. By\r\nthis modification the risk of the mutual influence of the pendulum\r\nand the clock is avoided.\r\n\r\n4. The disk was attached to the thread by means of knots in the\r\nthread itself; avoiding the correction for the small cup usually\r\nemployed for that purpose.\r\n\r\n5. An alteration was made in the weight and shape of the knife-edge\r\nsuspension; reducing its weight to about 10 grains, and giving it the\r\nshape of a rotella, instead of that of a triangular prism.\r\n\r\nThe simple pendulum and microscopes were attached to a strong\r\nwall, in a room on the ground floor, contiguous to the temporary\r\nobservatory, and well sheltered from the sun and weather. The clock\r\nwith which the pendulum was compared, was supported by a pyramid of\r\nmasonry resting on the ground, and occupying the middle of the room.\r\nThe experimental length between the microscopes was referred to three\r\nstandard metres, [p157] in perfect agreement with each other: one\r\nreceived from Paris by the Commission of Weights and Measures at\r\nMilan; a second brought more recently from Paris by Conte Moscati;\r\nand a third in the possession of the Royal Academy of Turin.\r\n\r\nThe experiments were commenced on the 3rd of September, and\r\nterminated on the 27th, being interrupted by M. Carlini’s absence\r\nat Chambery from the 7th to the 12th. The distance between the\r\nmicroscopes, and the oscillations and length of the pendulum,\r\nwere measured alternately. Thirteen independent results were thus\r\nobtained, of which the greatest discordance from the mean was not\r\nmore than 13/10000ths of a British inch. The mean result was 39.0992\r\nBritish inches, the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in a\r\nvacuum, at the place of observation on Mont Cenis, 1943 metres, or\r\n6374 feet above the sea, in the latitude of 45° 14′ 10″. To compare\r\nwith this determination, we may obtain a tolerably fair approximation\r\nto the pendulum at the level of the sea in the latitude of 45° 14′\r\n10″, such as its length might have been found, if the mountain could\r\nhave been removed and the pendulum placed on its site, by deduction\r\nfrom the lengths actually measured with a similar apparatus, on the\r\narc between Formentera and Dunkirk, at stations not far removed from\r\nthe level of the sea, in the adjacent parallels to Mont Cenis, and in\r\nthe countries adjoining. Of these there are five, not including the\r\nstation at Clermont, in consequence of its great elevation: they are\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n             °  ′  ″\r\n Dunkirk    51 02 10; its pendulum at the level of the sea = 39.13771\r\n Paris      48 50 14;         \"     \"        \"          \"    39.12894\r\n Bordeau    44 50 26;         \"     \"        \"          \"    39.11295\r\n Figeac     44 36 45;         \"     \"        \"          \"    39.11212\r\n Formentera 38 39 56;         \"     \"        \"          \"    39.09176\r\n\r\nThe mean length of the seconds pendulum at the level of the sea, in\r\nthe latitude of 45° 14′ 10″, deduced from these determinations, is\r\n39.1154; and it is so equally, whether an ellipticity of 1/288th,\r\nor of 1/304th, or any intermediate ellipticity, be assumed in the\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, 39.1154−39.0992 = ·0162 inch., as the [p158] measure\r\nof the difference in the intensity of gravitation at the place of\r\nobservation elevated 1943 metres; and at the level of the sea. The\r\nradius of the earth, being 6,376,478 metres, this measure, according\r\nto the duplicate proportion of the distances from the earth’s centre,\r\nshould be ·0238 inch. The attraction of the mountain is, then,\r\nequal to ·0238−·0162 = ·0076 inch. Whence it appears that, in this\r\nparticular instance, the correction for the elevation is reduced,\r\nby the attraction of the interposed matter, 68/100ths, or to about\r\n7/10ths of the amount immediately deducible from the squares of the\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that, if we possessed a correct knowledge of the\r\ndensity and arrangement of the materials of which Mont Cenis is\r\ncomposed, so as to enable a computation of the sum of all the\r\nattractions which they exercise on the place of observation, this\r\nresult might furnish, as well as Dr. Maskelyne’s experiments on the\r\ndeviation of the plumb-line produced by the attraction of Mount\r\nSchehallien, a certain determination of the mean density of the\r\nearth. Professor Carlini considers that the form of the eminence may\r\nbe sufficiently represented by a segment of a sphere, a geographical\r\nmile in height, having as its base a circle of 11 miles diameter,\r\nthe distance from Susa to Lansleburgo; the attractive force, on\r\na point placed on the summit, would, in such case, be equal to\r\n2 π δ (1 − (2/3) √(1/11)) or in numbers to 5·020 δ, δ being the\r\ndensity of the mountain, and 2 π the ratio of the circumference to\r\nradius. The attractive force of the earth, on a point at its surface,\r\nis (4/3) π r Δ, = 14394 Δ, _r_ being the radius of the earth = 3437\r\ngeographical miles, and Δ its mean density. Now these two quantities,\r\n14394 Δ and 5·020 δ, should be, to each other, in the proportion\r\nof 39.1154,—the pendulum at the level of the sea, representing\r\ngravitation at the surface of the earth,—to ·0076, the portion of\r\ngravitation at the summit of the mountain due to the attraction\r\nof the mountain. By the observations of M. de Saussure and other\r\ngeologists, Mont Cenis is chiefly composed of schistus, marble, and\r\ngypsum; the specific gravities of which substances were ascertained,\r\nfrom numerous specimens in the possession of M. Carlini, to be\r\nrespectively as follows:— [p159]\r\n\r\n The schistous    2·81.\r\n The marble       2·86.\r\n The gypsum       2.32.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a precise knowledge of the quantity and position\r\nor each of these three component parts, we may take the mean, 2.66,\r\nof their several densities as approximatively the density of the\r\nmountain, = δ. We have then\r\n\r\n      5.02 δ × 39.1154\r\n Δ = --------------  = 4.77,\r\n       14394 × ·0076\r\n\r\na result differing little from that of Cavendish as recently\r\ncorrected by Dr. Hutton, and still less from that of the Schehallien\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nThe most hypothetical element of this calculation is the width\r\nassigned to the base of the mountain; but by the very nature of the\r\nquestion, it has but little influence on the final result; since,\r\nby even doubling the assigned diameter, the total attraction would\r\nnot be altered a twentieth. In regard to the mean density of the\r\nmountain, if it were taken at 2.75, instead of 2.66, that of the\r\nearth would result 4.94, instead of 4.77, as given above.\r\n\r\n E.

By Mr. James Acon.\r\n\r\nFew gardens are to be found in which bunches of fresh ripe grapes can\r\nbe gathered every day in the year: notwithstanding the importance\r\nof the fruit to the luxurious, and the facility with which the vine\r\nsubmits to the artificial climate of the forcing-house. Nothing is\r\neasier than to secure crops of grapes in a vinery during the spring\r\nand summer months; but it is far more difficult to obtain them in\r\nthe last and earliest seasons of the year, when the plants would\r\n[p160] naturally be in state of torpidity. It is well known that\r\nthis desirable purpose is attained in great perfection in the garden\r\nof the Earl of Surrey, at Worksop Manor; and the management there\r\npractised is the subject of this paper.\r\n\r\nThe common methods of forcing early grapes are to train the vines\r\nunder the roof near the glass, or on small frames against flued\r\nwalls; but to both these practices Mr. Acon finds great objections:\r\nto the former because it renders the house too dark, and exposes the\r\nyoung and tender branches to the pernicious effect of blasts of cold\r\nair rushing through the interstices of the panes; and to the latter,\r\nbecause the heat of the flues is apt to scorch the branches, and\r\nin consequence to destroy the crop,—excessive heat in the one case\r\nproducing the same injurious effects as excessive cold in the other.\r\nThe following are the two modes by which Mr. Acon obtains his _very\r\nearly_ and his _very late_ grapes. For the early crops a house is\r\nused, of which the back wall is 9.6 feet in height, and the front\r\nwall 3 feet, the roof forming an angle of about 30 degrees. It is\r\nheated, from the absolute necessity of employing an atmosphere of\r\nunusually high temperature, with two flues that pass along the middle\r\nof the house, and return in the back wall; a fire-place being built\r\nat each end of the house. Forcing begins on the first of September,\r\nand the fruit begins to ripen the first week in March. The vines\r\nare trained upon a trellis, fixed over the flues, in the centre of\r\nthe house, and also upon the back wall; but none are allowed to\r\nobstruct the light by occupying the roof, until about six weeks after\r\nthe forcing has commenced, when some new shoots are introduced and\r\ntrained to the rafters. The form of this house gives it a peculiar\r\nadvantage, in presenting a greater surface for the growth of vines\r\nthan can be derived from any other plan; the trellis which is placed\r\nover the flues is nearly equal to the whole roof, without being in\r\nany degree injurious to the plants trained upon the back wall. The\r\nvines are planted in the inside of the house, but in such a manner\r\nthat the mould in which they grow is not heated by the fire-places\r\nof either flue. The usual mode of exposing the main stem of a forced\r\nvine to an extremely low temperature in the external air, while the\r\nbranches are stimulated by a very high temperature in an entirely\r\ndifferent atmosphere, is very properly objected to. Nothing, in\r\nfact, can be more injudicious than such a practice, in cases where\r\nvery early forcing is required; for it should be borne in mind,\r\nthat although the absorption of the elements by which the proper\r\njuices of a [p161] plant are elaborated, and brought into the state\r\nunder which they appear in the fruit, and in the secretions of the\r\nplant, is carried on by the leaves alone, yet that all these juices\r\nhave, in the first instance, to pass along the vessels of the stem\r\nbefore they reach the leaves; and that the whole of the bark of a\r\ntree is, rightly considered, a leaf of a particular description,\r\nformed of the same kind of tissue, and exercising the same functions,\r\nand undoubtedly producing a powerful effect upon the motion of the\r\nfluids of the branches, with the vessels of which it is elaborately\r\nand intimately entangled, from the core to the circumference. No\r\nargument can be necessary to show that an equal action of the vessels\r\nof a plant is indispensable to the due maintenance of the vegetable\r\nfunctions in a healthy state, and that this is not to be maintained\r\nby exposing the main stem and the extremities to an atmosphere and\r\ntemperature entirely different. Such irregularities do not exist in\r\nfree Nature, and she will not submit to them when in fetters.\r\n\r\nIn pruning vines for early forcing, as little wood should be employed\r\nas possible. Mr. Acon stops the shoots one joint above each cluster,\r\nand has no joint without a bunch. When the crop is over, and the wood\r\nperfectly matured, the branches should be laid near the ground, and\r\nshaded till the recommencement of forcing. In short, they should be\r\nplaced in a condition as nearly as possible resembling the gloom and\r\ncold of winter. If this process be well managed, the vines will alter\r\ntheir natural habits, and instead of budding with the spring, their\r\nvegetation will naturally commence at the period at which they have\r\nbeen accustomed to be stimulated.\r\n\r\nFor late grapes, a house of a different construction is employed.\r\nThe back wall is 12 feet high, the front wall 1-1/2 foot, and the\r\nroof lies at an angle of 45 degrees. The heat is supplied by a single\r\nflue passing along the middle of the house. The sorts best adapted\r\nfor late forcing are the Muscat of Alexandria, the St. Peter’s, and\r\nthe Black Damascus; all other kinds wither prematurely. This house\r\nis generally shut about the middle or end of May, as soon as the\r\nbunches become visible. The vines are trained on a trellis near the\r\nglass. Till they are out of blossom the air is kept very warm, a\r\npoint to which much importance attaches, because it is during this\r\nperiod that all the branches that are to bear fruit in the succeeding\r\nseason are produced. In a high temperature, the branches will grow\r\nmore compactly, and [p162] will be more regularly matured than in\r\na low temperature, in which the wood is apt to become excessively\r\nluxuriant, and not to ripen well. Great attention must be paid to\r\nthis point. As much air as possible is introduced into the vinery\r\nduring the summer; but as the autumn advances, more caution in this\r\nrespect is observed. The fruit should be perfectly coloured at the\r\napproach of the dark season; for if the colouring be deferred too\r\nlong, the berries will never acquire their proper flavour. Great\r\ncare must be observed to remove daily such berries as are inclining\r\nto damp, or the whole crop will soon be spoiled. This should be\r\nparticularly attended to; for the contagion of what gardeners call\r\n_damp_, arises from the growth of minute fungi which vegetate upon\r\nthe epidermis, and spread during the autumn with alarming rapidity\r\nfrom bunch to bunch.\r\n\r\nThe pruning of vines for late forcing is the same as has been already\r\nexplained. When the crop is gathered, the house is unroofed for a\r\nshort time, in order to expose the branches to a low temperature,\r\nand to the degree of humidity necessary to replenish their vessels,\r\nwhich have been drained by the dryness of the climate in which, when\r\nforced, they were necessarily kept.\r\n\r\nBy the means above described, a regular supply of grapes is secured\r\nthrough the year. The late-house crop lasts from the middle of\r\nJanuary to the end of March; it is succeeded by the first crop in\r\nthe early-house, which carries on the supply into May, and it is\r\ncontinued by the grapes on the rafters in the same house until the\r\nvines in the pine stoves, which are forced early in January and\r\nFebruary, produce their crops. These continue bearing through the\r\nsummer, when a vinery, of which the forcing commences about the end\r\nof March, furnishes the supply till the late-house fruit is ready in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole this may be considered a most instructive and valuable\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n\r\n II. _On the Varieties of Cardoon, and the Methods of cultivating\r\n them_. By Mr. A. Mathews.\r\n\r\nWho does not wish to read of the cardoon; of that prince of\r\nvegetables, whose praises have been sung or said by all cooks and\r\ngourmands, from the fastidious Périgords and Cardellis of the\r\nFrench _cuisine_, down to the more homely Rundells and Glasses\r\nof our English kitchens; whose virtues are so marvellous as to\r\nbe credible upon no less authority [p163] than that of the sage\r\ngastrophilists aforesaid. To restore unwonted vigour to old age,\r\nand new elasticity to youth, are the most modest of its attributes;\r\nthe magical broth with which the veins of Æson were replenished by\r\nthe cunning Medea, was doubtless prepared from the cardoon; and the\r\nstory itself is probably a sort of figurative record of the skill\r\nof the fair enchantress in cooking this delicious vegetable, which\r\nwas well known to the Grecian gastronomes under the name of κακτος;\r\nbut this we throw out merely as a suggestion. Upon preparing herbs\r\nthus potent for the table, cookery has exhausted all its skill; to\r\ndress a cardoon is declared, by the highest authority in the art, to\r\nbe the surest test of a skilful cook; and one of those invaluable\r\nacquirements which, to borrow the words of a writer not less\r\ncelebrated for his powers of composition than of cooking, “raises\r\ncookery to the rank of the _sciences_, and its _professors_ to the\r\ntitle of artists.” Our good forefathers, indeed, “could not find the\r\ntrue manner of dressing cardoons,” and were content to eat them raw\r\n“with vinegar and oyl, pepper and salt, all of them, or some, as\r\nevery one liketh for their delight;” which, considering that this\r\nvegetable is both bitter and astringent in a high degree, does not\r\nargue much for the delicacy of palate of our ancestors; little did\r\nthey dream of the savoury preparations that modern art has devised by\r\nthe aid of Espagnole, consommé, blancs, tammies, marking, masking,\r\nand all the mysteries of the stew-pan.\r\n\r\nFour varieties are here described, of which the Spanish cardoon is\r\nthe most common, and the cardon de Tours the best.\r\n\r\nThey are cultivated, like celery, in deep broad trenches, well\r\nmanured and watered. When the plants are nearly full-grown, which\r\nwill be about the end of October, a dry day is to be chosen for\r\nperforming the operation of blanching them, which is thus effected:—\r\n\r\n “The leaves of each plant are carefully and lightly tied together\r\n with strong matting, keeping the whole upright, and the ribs of\r\n the leaves together. The plant is then bound closely round with\r\n twisted haybands, about an inch and a half in diameter, beginning\r\n at the root, and continuing to about two-thirds of its height. If\r\n the plants are intended for winter store, they must be earthed up\r\n like celery; but if to be consumed before the frosts set in, the\r\n operation of earthing up may be omitted.” [p164]\r\n\r\n\r\n III. _Accounts and Descriptions of the several Plants belonging\r\n to the genus Hoya, which are cultivated in the garden of the\r\n Horticultural Society at Chiswick_. By Mr. James Traill.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of one species of Hoya, viz., H. _carnosa_, has long\r\ncaused it to be a favourite with collectors. The object of the writer\r\nof this paper is to call attention to such others as are known to\r\nexist in gardens, or as are preserved in the records of the botanist.\r\n\r\nThe following species form the subject of the paper, viz.:\r\n\r\n1 Hoya carnosa, _R. Brown_. 2 Hoya crassifolia, _Haworth_. 3 Hoya\r\npallida, _Lindley_. 4 Hoya Pottsii, (Tab. I.) 5 Hoya trinervis.\r\n\r\nThese five are all the species at present cultivated in gardens;\r\nothers are known to exist in the warmer regions of Asia, where they\r\nshould be assiduously sought for by travellers, as they are not only\r\nvery ornamental, but easily to be transported to Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom such materials as he has been able to procure, the writer\r\nenumerates the following as completing the genus Hoya, as far as at\r\npresent ascertained:\r\n\r\n6 Hoya chinensis. 7 Hoya viridiflora, _R. Brown_. 8 Hoya lanceolata,\r\n_D. Don_. 9 Hoya linearis, _D. Don_. 10 Hoya australis, _R. Brown_,\r\n_MSS_. 11 Hoya nicobarica, _R. Brown, MSS_. 12 Hoya augustifolia.\r\n\r\nThe paper concludes with a detailed explanation of the best manner of\r\ncultivating Hoyas.\r\n\r\n\r\n IV. _On acclimatizing Plants at Biel, in East Lothian_. By Mr. John\r\n Street, gardener to the Honourable Mrs. Hamilton Nesbitt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no point whatever, connected with Horticulture, of\r\ngreater interest than that which forms the subject of this paper;\r\nit is the distant goal towards which we all are striving, but of\r\nwhich, alas! we have not as yet even caught a glimpse. The gardener\r\nis in possession of the powers by which he can bend the seasons to\r\nhis will; he can dispel the frozen gloom of winter with the rich\r\nwarm glow of the vintage; at his call the flowers of spring and\r\nsummer start up beneath his feet, and his hothouses are filled with\r\nthe luscious fruits of the torrid zone. All this he knows how to\r\neffect with an artificial climate; but he has no influence over the\r\nnatural climate of his country, nor can he impart to the vegetation\r\nof warmer latitudes the least additional power of resisting cold, for\r\nwhich they have not been prepared by nature. Acclimatizing is still\r\na secret to be discovered. To [p165] this day not a single instance\r\ncan be adduced of any exotic plant whatever possessing greater powers\r\nof withstanding cold, than it had when first introduced. It has been\r\nhoped that if the seeds of given plant could be procured, for many\r\ngenerations, in a climate severer than its own, the offspring so\r\nobtained would gradually accommodate themselves to their new country;\r\nbut no such result has followed from the experiments that have been\r\ntried. Let us take a few familiar examples:—the common nasturtium,\r\n(Tropælum majus,) a native of Peru, is said to have been introduced\r\nabout the year 1686. At the time at which we are writing, it must\r\nhave descended through about 140 generations; and yet it has not\r\nbecome in the smallest degree capable of resisting cold. Of the\r\nmignonette (Reseda odorata), the date of introduction is not well\r\nascertained; it has probably been a favourite border annual for sixty\r\nor seventy years, and yet it has in no degree shaken off its annual\r\ncharacter, which is unnatural to it, and resumed the suffrutescent\r\nhabit which it possesses in its own milder climate. The potato,\r\ntoo, which has for two centuries and a half been increased in every\r\nconceivable manner, by seeds as well as by offsets, bears cold in\r\nno degree more readily than it did in the sixteenth century. Nor\r\ndoes it appear to us probable, that acclimatizing, if practicable,\r\nis to be brought about by sowing seeds in northern latitudes\r\nthrough successive generations. We do not believe that plants will\r\nbear their seeds at all in a temperature much lower than that in\r\nwhich they have been located by the hand of Nature. The heat of a\r\nnorthern summer sufficiently approximates to that of the tropics,\r\nto be considered, with reference to vegetation, as the same, and\r\nit is during that season that the seeds of all plants are ripened;\r\nthe conditions, therefore, under which the seeds of Tropæolum, for\r\nexample, are produced in England, do not materially differ from those\r\nunder which the same seeds are produced in Peru; if the season proves\r\nunpropitious in any considerable degree, they are not produced at\r\nall. How then can it be expected that seeds ripened under similar\r\ncircumstances, but in different latitudes, should give birth to a\r\nprogeny differing in any remarkable particular from their parents?\r\nIn fact, in power of resisting cold, they do not differ at all. If\r\nsuch a capability were to obtained, it would be by inducing plants to\r\nripen their seeds in winter.\r\n\r\nBut if it is certain that nothing is to be gained in acclimatizing,\r\nby raising plants from seed through successive generations, [p166]\r\nit is no less true that many trees, which have been supposed to be\r\nincapable of surviving a northern winter, are now ascertained to be\r\nperfectly hardy, and that the power of enduring cold may be increased\r\nin others, by a judicious management of soil and situation.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of vegetable life being destroyed by cold, probably\r\narises from the vessels, through which the circulation and secretion\r\nof the fluids of plants take place, being ruptured by the expansion,\r\nfrom cold, of the fluid they contain. In proportion, therefore,\r\nto the tenuity of the vessels, and the abundance of their fluid,\r\nwill be the danger to which they are exposed from frost; and to the\r\nstrength of the vessels, and the paucity of their fluid, the power\r\nof resisting cold. Thus vigorous shoots of the oak, walnut, and many\r\nother trees, which are formed with rapidity, imperfectly matured,\r\nand highly charged with fluid, are extremely impatient of cold, and\r\nare even destroyed by a few degrees of frost; while the twigs and\r\nbranches of the same trees, which are formed slowly, fully matured,\r\nand incompletely filled with fluid, bear unharmed the utmost rigour\r\nof our winters. In acclimatizing, therefore, this law should be\r\ncarefully remembered, and the situations in which tender plants are\r\nstationed, should be those in which their growth is restrained, and\r\nan excessive absorption of fluid prevented.\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been the true secret of the success that has\r\nattended the attempts at acclimatizing, which form the subject of\r\nMr. Street’s communication. By planting in situations well drained\r\nfrom superfluous moisture, under circumstances where rapid growth\r\nwas rendered impracticable, and, as we understand, in a garden\r\nadmirably adapted to the object, from its position, he has succeeded\r\nin naturalizing, in latitude 56° N., plants which have not yet been\r\nknown to endure the winters even of the parallel of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n V. _Upon the Culture of Celery_. By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq.,\r\n F.R.S., President.\r\n\r\n“That which can be very easily done, without the exertion of much\r\nskill or ingenuity, is,” Mr. Knight observes, “very rarely found\r\nto be well done, the excitement to excellence being in such cases\r\nnecessarily very feeble.” This remark is in the present case applied\r\nto the cultivation of celery, which, being a native of the sides\r\nof wet ditches, might naturally be expected to demand an abundant\r\nsupply of water when cultivated. Accordingly, Mr. Knight found that\r\nby keeping the ground, in which celery was planted, [p167] constantly\r\nwet, it grew by the middle of September to the height of five feet,\r\nand its quality was in proportion to its size. Mr. Knight also\r\nrecommends planting at greater distances than is usually the case,\r\nand covering the beds, into which the young seedlings are first\r\nremoved, with half-rotten dung, overspread to the depth of about two\r\ninches with mould; under which circumstances, whenever the plants are\r\nremoved, the dung will adhere tenaciously to their roots, and it will\r\nnot be necessary to deprive the plants of any part of their leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n VI. _Report upon the New or Rare Plants which flowered in the Garden\r\n of the Horticultural Society at Chiswick, between March, 1825, and\r\n March, 1826_. Part 1. _Tender Plants_. By John Lindley, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this paper consisting of botanical details which do\r\nnot bear curtailing, we shall only extract the names of the new\r\nspecies described in it, as a guide to our botanical readers. In the\r\nwhole, thirty-three species are noticed; of which the following are\r\npublished for the first time:—\r\n\r\n2 Passiflora obscura. 7 Solanum dealbatum. 10 Tabernæmontana\r\ngratissima. 13 Tephrosia? Chinensis. 15 Hellenia abnormis. 16\r\nGesneria Douglassii. 21 Gynandropsis pulchella. 23 Rodriguezia\r\nplanifolia. 26 Brassavola nodosa. 33 Phycella corusca.\r\n\r\n\r\n VII. _Account of a Protecting Frame for Fruit-Trees on Walls_. By\r\n Mr. John Dick.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the fruit upon walls from the ravages of bees,\r\nwasps, flies, and other winged enemies, a frame is contrived fitting\r\nclose to the face of the wall, and having a moveable sliding canvass\r\nfront, which can be readily removed when the fruit is to be gathered,\r\nand replaced again afterwards. A plan of the frame accompanies the\r\npaper. From what we have seen of this contrivance, we know that it is\r\nwell adapted to its purpose, and that no garden in which fine fruit\r\nis required, should be without one or more of such frames. For the\r\nmode of making them, we must refer to the paper itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n VIII. _On the Esculent Egg-Plants_. By Mr. Andrew Mathews.\r\n\r\nIn this country, the egg-plant, brinjal, or aubergine, is chiefly\r\ncultivated as a curiosity; but in warmer climates, where its growth\r\nis attended with less trouble, it is a favourite article of the\r\nkitchen-garden. In the form of fritters, or farces, or in soups, it\r\nis frequently brought to table in all the southern parts of Europe;\r\nand forms a pleasant [p168] variety of esculent. This paper describes\r\nthe only two kinds that are worth cultivation in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n IX. _Notices of Communications to the Horticultural Society, between\r\n January 1, 1824, and January 1, 1825. Extracted from the Minute\r\n Books and Papers of the Society_.\r\n\r\nA novel kind of pine pit is described, which is said to answer every\r\npurpose that can be desired. It is heated by flues passing through a\r\nchamber, formed by beams extending from the back to the front wall,\r\nand so becoming a sort of floor, upon which is first placed a layer\r\nof turf; and then the tan in which the pine-plants are plunged. The\r\nwarmer air is conveyed into the upper part of the pit by means of\r\nsmall apertures contrived in the walls, at four inches and a half\r\napart, both in the back and front of the pit, and also through\r\niron pipes resting on the beams and passing through the tan. The\r\nventilation is effected by air-holes in the front wall, and sliding\r\nshutters in the back walls. An explanatory figure accompanies the\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nThe famous rhubarb, which has of late acquired so much celebrity\r\nunder the name of Buck’s rhubarb, is mentioned as excellent when\r\nforced. It is not generally known, that this sort is the genuine\r\nRheum undulatum of botanists uncontaminated by mixture with the\r\ncommon garden kinds. The plant generally called Rheum undulatum, is\r\na half-bred, possessing none of the good qualities of the native\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nGeorge Tollet, Esq., of Betley Hall, in Staffordshire, recommends\r\nthe preservation of apples for winter store, packed in banks or\r\nhods of earth like potatoes. The method is said to be effectual and\r\neconomical.\r\n\r\nThomas Bond, Esq., of East Looe, in Cornwall, describes his mode of\r\ncultivating strawberries. He does not adopt the common practice of\r\ncutting off the runners, but they are confined to the bed by being\r\nturned back among the plants from which they spring. In the autumn,\r\nthe beds are covered to the depth of two inches with fresh earth,\r\nthrough which the strawberry plants shoot in the spring with great\r\nvigour.\r\n\r\nA kind of wicker basket is described, which is cheap and well adapted\r\nfor screening half hardy plants during the winter. It is fixed in the\r\nearth by means of the points of the ribs of the wicker work, which\r\nare allowed to project a few inches for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by John Wedgewood, Esq., that good celery may be readily\r\nobtained by transplanting seedling plants that have remained in the\r\nseed bed, till they had acquired a [p169] considerable size. They\r\ngrow more vigorously than the younger plants that are transplanted in\r\nthe usual way.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cotton, Esq., of Wellwood-house, describes the good effects\r\nof painting an old garden wall with seal oil and anticorrosion paint.\r\nThe wall in question was covered with trees, which were every year\r\nattacked by blight. Since the operation the trees have borne good\r\nfruit, made healthy wood, and been free from the bad consequences of\r\nblight.\r\n\r\nMr. John Mearns states, that the red and white Antwerp raspberries\r\nmay be brought to bear abundantly in August, long after the usual\r\ncrop of raspberries is past, by the following management. In May he\r\nremoves the young fruit, bearing shoots, from the canes, leaving in\r\nsome cases one or two eyes, in others, cutting them clean off. Under\r\neither plan, they soon produce an abundance of vigorous new shoots,\r\nwhich blossom freely in July.\r\n\r\nMr. Elias Hildyard, gardener to Sir Thomas Frankland, kills the grub\r\nwhich infests his onion beds by trenching the beds in winter, digging\r\nin manure at the same time, and leaving them exposed to the frost in\r\na rough state till the time of sowing.\r\n\r\nA mode of inducing fertility in a barren Swan’s-egg pear-tree trained\r\nupon a wall, is described by the Rev. John Fisher, of Wavenden, in\r\nBuckinghamshire. It consists in twisting and breaking down the side\r\nshoots of the main branches in such a way, as to make them pendulous\r\nwithout separating them wholly from the parent limb. In a short time\r\na grumous formation takes place where the fracture has occurred, the\r\nwound heals, the flow of the sap is moderated, and fruit buds are\r\nformed instead of sterile shoots.\r\n\r\nMr. William Mowbray, gardener to the Earl of Mountnorris, states,\r\nthat the different species of eatable Passifloras which do not\r\ngenerally produce fruit, may be induced to do so abundantly, if the\r\npollen of other species is applied to their stigmas.\r\n\r\nCurrants are preserved in perfection in the garden of James Webster,\r\nEsq., of Westham, by being covered with bunting when the fruit is\r\nfully ripe, care being had to unloose the bunting occasionally from\r\nthe bottom of the bushes, in order to remove the decaying fallen\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n X. _Report on the Instruments employed in, and on the Plan of a\r\n Journal of Meteorological Observations, kept in the garden of the\r\n Horticultural Society at Chiswick_.\r\n\r\nThis and the following paper we propose to notice in detail on a\r\nfuture occasion. [p170]\r\n\r\n\r\n XI. _Journal of Meteorological Observations made in the garden of\r\n the Horticultural Society at Chiswick, during the year 1826_. By Mr.\r\n William Beattie Booth.\r\n\r\n\r\n XII. _On Orache, its Varieties and Cultivation_. By Mr. William\r\n Townshend.\r\n\r\nThe herb orache was formerly cultivated as a kind of summer spinach;\r\nbut in this country it has long been expelled from the kitchen garden\r\nby other kinds. It is, however, still seen in the gardens of France,\r\nwhere it is commonly called Arroche des jardins, being used in that\r\ncountry, both by itself as a spinach, and mixed with sorrel, the\r\nacidity of which it corrects. Seven varieties are described, which do\r\nnot differ in their qualities, but are distinguished by the colour of\r\ntheir foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n XIII. _On planting the moist Alluvial Banks of Rivers with\r\n Fruit-Trees_. By Mr. John Robertson.\r\n\r\nThe object of this writer is to show that the low grounds that form\r\nthe banks of rivers are, of all others, the best adapted for the\r\ngrowth of fruit trees; the alluvial soil of which they are composed,\r\nbeing an intermixture of the richest and most soluble parts of the\r\nneighbouring lands, with a portion of animal and vegetable matter,\r\naffording an inexhaustible fund of nourishment. In such situations,\r\nhowever, the trees are liable to injury from floods in the winter,\r\nunless some means are used of draining off the stagnant water. This\r\nis to be effected by digging deep trenches between the rows of trees,\r\ncasting up the earth from the trenches around the trees on either\r\nside, so as to form elevated banks. Such is the practice in Holland,\r\nwhere the western slopes of the dykes are generally covered with\r\nfruit-trees, chiefly apples and pears. Mr. Robertson is of opinion,\r\nthat the banks should be raised, if possible, at least three or four\r\nfeet above the highest water-mark, and be made eighteen feet broad\r\nat the base, and twelve at top; the trenches should be fifteen or\r\nsixteen feet wide, admitting the soil to be three or four feet deep.\r\n\r\nUpon this plan, it is probable that abundant crops would be obtained;\r\nbut with regard to the quality of the produce, we suspect it will be\r\nquite as indifferent as the apples and pears of the Dutch, which are\r\nnotorious for their want of flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n XIV. _On Dahlias_. By Mr. William Smith.\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to distinguish by words the best varieties of\r\nthe Dahlia, and to fix the names of those which are the most worthy\r\nof cultivation. Sixty kinds are well described, [p171] arranged in\r\ndivisions depending upon the size of the plants and the colour of\r\ntheir flowers. We do not propose to analyze this paper, which is far\r\ntoo extensive for our limits; but instead, to throw together a few\r\nremarks which are suggested by the subject.\r\n\r\nThe first fact to which we would call attention has reference to\r\nacclimatization. The Dahlia has now been cultivated in Europe with\r\nthe utmost assiduity for nearly thirty years. During that period\r\nmillions of plants have been raised from seeds, and under almost\r\nevery possible variation of climate; and anomalies the most singular,\r\nnot only in colour, but in general constitution and physiological\r\nstructure, have been obtained. The colour of the flower has been\r\naltered from pale yellow, or lilac, to every hue of red, purple,\r\nor yellow, to pure scarlet and to deepest morone, or has even been\r\nwholly discharged from the radial florets in the white varieties; the\r\nperiod of flowering has been accelerated nearly two months; the tall\r\nrank weed, exceeding the human standard in height, has been reduced\r\nto a trim bush, emulating the pæony in dwarfishness; the yellow\r\ninconspicuous florets of the disk have been expelled to make room for\r\nthe showy deep-coloured florets of the ray; what is more remarkable\r\nstill, the same yellow inconspicuous florets of the disk have been\r\nenlarged, and stained with rich morone, so as to rival the colours of\r\nthe ray without losing their own peculiarity of form; and finally,\r\nthe whole foliage and bearing of the plant has been altered by the\r\nsubstitution of simple leaves for compound ones. But notwithstanding\r\nall this proneness to change, notwithstanding the multitude of\r\nvarieties which have been thus procured by seed, _not one individual\r\nhas yet been discovered, in any degree whatever, more hardy than its\r\nancestors_. The earliest frosts destroyed the Dahlias as certainly in\r\n1826, as they could have done in 1789.\r\n\r\nBut, however strong may be the disposition of the Dahlia to vary\r\nfrom its original structure, it is curious to observe how strictly\r\nit conforms to the laws by which such variations are controlled\r\nby nature. In altered structure all the changes take place from\r\ncircumference to centre. The florets of the ray displace those of the\r\ndisk, but the latter never attempt to occupy the ray; when a change\r\noccurs among the florets of the disk, they merely dilate and assume\r\nthe colour of the ray, without changing their position or their\r\npeculiar form. So with the leaves; by a reduction of the lateral\r\nleaflet, till the terminal one only remains, simple foliage is\r\nsubstituted for that which was compound: but no case has been found\r\nin [p172] which the suppression of the terminal leaflet has taken\r\nplace and the lateral ones have been preserved. In change of colour,\r\ntoo, there is a circumstance which demands consideration, and of\r\nwhich no explanation has yet been offered. It is not generally known,\r\nalthough long ago noticed by M. De Candolle, that among flowers,\r\nyellows will not produce blues, nor blues yellows, although both\r\nthese primitive colours will sport into almost every other hue. Thus\r\nthe hyacinth, the natural colour of which is blue, will not produce\r\na yellow, for the dull, half-green flowers called yellow hyacinths,\r\nare, in our judgment, whites approaching green; the blue crocus will\r\nnot vary into yellow, nor the yellow into blue; and the ranunculus\r\nand the dahlia, the natural colour of both which, notwithstanding\r\nthe popular belief to the contrary, with respect to the dahlia, is,\r\nwe believe, yellow, although they are the most sportive of all the\r\nflowers of the gardens, varying from pink to scarlet, and deepest\r\nshades of purple, have never yet been seen to exhibit any disposition\r\nto become blue. This subject offers a most amusing field for\r\ninvestigation, and would well repay the attentive consideration of\r\nthe philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n XV. _On the Cultivation of Camellias in an open Border_. By Mr.\r\n Joseph Harrison.\r\n\r\nMr. H. finds that the double red camellia, the double white, and\r\nthe double striped, will bear an English winter if planted out when\r\nabout two feet high, having been previously stunted in their growth\r\nby repeatedly stopping their leading shoots. For two winters the\r\nyoung plants are to be protected by a wooden screen fixed round\r\nthem, and covered by a hand-glass, the whole being enveloped in\r\nmats; afterwards they require no other protection than to be guarded\r\nfrom heavy snowstorms, and to be assisted by a thick covering of old\r\ntan upon the ground in which they grow, to the distance of two or\r\nthree feet from their stems. If this success has been met with in\r\nYorkshire, what may not be expected in our more southern counties!\r\nOn the 12th of March of the present year these camellias were not\r\ninjured by a frost which did considerable damage to the common laurel.\r\n\r\n\r\n XVI. _A Method of growing Crops of Melons on open Borders_. By Mr.\r\n William Greenshields.\r\n\r\nThe sorts fitted for this purpose are the black rock, scarlet rock,\r\ngreen-fleshed, netted and early Cantaloup melons. The method consists\r\nof forming a bed, by half filling a shallow [p173] trench with\r\ndecayed vegetables, and covering them with the exhausted linings\r\nof cucumber beds. The young plants are reared for some time under\r\nhandlights. For full particulars of this practice, we must refer to\r\nthe paper itself, which is clearly written, and, coming as it does\r\nfrom one of our most skilful gardeners, well worthy of attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n XVII. _Notice of Five Varieties of Pears received from Jersey in the\r\n year 1826_. By John Lindley, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe fruits here described are of the highest excellence. They are,\r\n1. the Marie Louise; 2. the Duchesse d’Angoulême; 3. the Doyenné\r\ngris; 4. the Doyenné panaché; 5. the Beurré d’Aremberg; and 6. the\r\nGloux morceaux. The second, the fifth, and the sixth kinds are\r\nrepresented in two very beautiful coloured plates; and are, perhaps,\r\nthe most exquisitely flavoured of all the varieties of the pear. The\r\nBeurré d’Aremberg and Gloux morceaux are long keepers; the others\r\nare autumnal kinds. Of the former it is said, “the flesh is whitish,\r\nfirm, very juicy, dissolves in the mouth, and is wholly destitute of\r\ngrittiness; it is sweet, rich, and so peculiarly high flavoured, that\r\nI know no pear that can be compared with it in that respect.”\r\n\r\n\r\n XVIII. _Upon the Culture of the Prunus Pseudo-cerasus, or Chinese\r\n Cherry_. By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq.\r\n\r\nThis species of cherry is expected to become an acquisition of\r\nconsiderable value, for the purpose of forcing; and also as an early\r\nfruit, when trained upon an open wall. Mr. Knight recommends its\r\npropagation by cuttings, which root freely, and that it be abundantly\r\nsupplied with liquid manure. From its highly excitable habits, he\r\nsuspects it to be a native of a cold climate, probably of Tartary.\r\n\r\n\r\n XIX. _On the Culture of the Pine-Apple_. By Mr. James Dall.\r\n\r\n\r\n XX. _On forcing Asparagus_. By the same.\r\n\r\nThese two papers were communicated by the Cambridge Horticultural\r\nSociety, having gained one of the annual silver medals presented\r\nby the London to Provincial Societies. They contain good practical\r\ndirections for the cultivation upon which they treat.\r\n\r\n\r\n XXI. _Observations upon forcing Garden Rhubarb_. By Mr. William\r\n Stothard.\r\n\r\nThis plan is perhaps the best that can be followed, as it is at once\r\nthe most certain and the most simple. You sow rhubarb seed on a rich\r\nmoist border in the beginning of April, [p174] The young plants are\r\nwell thinned during the summer; in the end of October they are very\r\ncarefully transplanted into forcing-pots, five or six in each pot.\r\nThey are placed in a north aspect, to recover the effect of their\r\nremoval from the seed-bed, and in a month they are fit for forcing.\r\nWe can safely recommend this method.\r\n\r\n\r\n XXII. _Account of some remarkable Holly Hedges and Trees in\r\n Scotland_. By Joseph Sabine, Esq.\r\n\r\nThis is in elaborate account of extraordinary specimens of hollies,\r\nand appears to have been written with a view to induce the more\r\ngeneral cultivation in this country of that very valuable tree. At\r\nTynningham, the residence of the Earl of Harrington, are hedges\r\nextending to no less a distance than 2952 yards, in some cases\r\nthirteen feet broad, and twenty-five feet high. The age of these\r\nhedges is something more than a century. At the same place are\r\nindividual trees of a size quite unknown in these southern districts.\r\nOne tree measured five feet three inches in circumference at three\r\nfeet from the ground; the stem is clear of branches to the height\r\nof fourteen feet, and the total height of the tree is fifty-four\r\nfeet. The other places at which the hollies are of unusual size,\r\nare Colinton-house the seat of Sir William Forbes; Moredun, the\r\nseat of David Anderson, Esq.; Hopetoun-house, the seat of the Earl\r\nof Hopetoun, and Gordon-castle, where are several large groups of\r\nhollies, apparently planted by the hand of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n XXIII. _An Account of a Plan of Heating Stoves by means of Hot\r\n Water, employed in the Garden of_ Anthony Bacon, Esq.\r\n\r\nWe conceive that a new æra in horticulture will commence with the\r\npublication of this paper. We already possessed contrivances of a\r\nsufficiently good kind for all purposes connected with artificial\r\nclimate, except the power of commanding heat; for which the two\r\nmethods hitherto employed have been either too clumsy or too costly,\r\nand in either case liable to numerous objections. The old mode of\r\nintroducing heat into a stove, by means of brick flues, has long been\r\nconsidered so bad, that every scheme that promised to supersede such\r\nflues has been hailed with joy; the uncertainty of the quantity of\r\nheat given out by a brick flue, its continual liability to explosion,\r\nthe impossibility of preventing the escape of smoke from between the\r\njoints of the bricks, are all evils that require a remedy. For this\r\npurpose steam was introduced, and with great advantage in extensive\r\nranges of hothouses. But the enormous expense of erecting a steam\r\n[p175] apparatus, the danger attending its use in the charge of an\r\nunskilful or careless gardener, and also the rapid loss of heat\r\nfrom the pipes upon any neglect of the boiler, have all contributed\r\nto prevent the use of steam becoming very general. The plan now\r\ndescribed has the great merit of possessing all the good qualities\r\nof steam, without any of its objectionable accompaniments; its cost\r\ncannot in any considerable degree exceed that of flues, and its\r\neffects are so certain and durable, that a house so heated may be\r\nalmost said to be beyond the power of neglect on the part of the\r\ngardener.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into the details of this plan, for which we must\r\nrefer to the paper itself, we shall content ourselves with explaining\r\nits principle. Suppose two iron reservoirs, A and B, of equal\r\ncapacity, placed twenty feet apart, and connected at the top and the\r\nbottom by iron pipes, the level of both reservoirs being the same;\r\nit is obvious that water poured into one of these reservoirs will\r\nflow into the other through the connecting pipes, and that it will\r\nconsequently stand at the same height in both. Let the reservoirs\r\nbe thus filled above the level of the uppermost pipe, and heat be\r\napplied to the bottom of one reservoir, A; the water in this will\r\npresently be forced through the upper pipe into the reservoir, B, of\r\nwater not heated; in proportion as the heated water flows out of A,\r\nthrough the upper pipe, the cold water will flow out of B through\r\nthe lower pipe; and by this means a circulation of water heated and\r\nwater to be heated will be formed, which will continue as long as the\r\napplication of fire to the bottom of one reservoir is continued. When\r\nit is discontinued, the temperature of the two reservoirs and of the\r\nintermediate pipes will be the same within three or four degrees.\r\nAs it is the property of heated water to part with its heat very\r\nslowly, it follows that heat will continue to be disengaged from the\r\nreservoirs and pipes long after the application of fire has ceased.\r\nIn fact, when the two reservoirs are once heated, the gardener may\r\nmake up his fires and retire to rest, certain that his house is\r\nsufficiently provided with heat for the night.\r\n\r\nThe paper is accompanied with a plan of a vinery warmed upon this\r\nprinciple. [p176]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _On the Recent Elucidations of early Egyptian History_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the present century, the researches of\r\nphilologists have ascertained that the language of ancient Egypt,—the\r\nlanguage of the hieroglyphical inscriptions engraven on its ancient\r\ntemples and monuments, and of the still existing manuscripts of the\r\nsame period,—differs from the modern Egyptian or Coptic, only in the\r\nmixture in the latter of many Greek and Arabian and a smaller portion\r\nof Latin words, introduced during the successive dominion of the\r\nGreeks, the Romans, and the Arabs, and occasionally substituted for\r\nthe corresponding native words. The grammatical construction of the\r\nlanguage has remained the same at all periods of its employment: and\r\nit finally ceased to be a spoken language towards the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, when it was replaced by the Arabian.\r\n\r\nIn writing their language, the ancient Egyptians employed\r\nthree different kinds of characters. First, _figurative_; or\r\nrepresentations of the objects themselves. Second, _symbolic_; or\r\nrepresentations of certain physical or material objects, expressing\r\nmetaphorically, or conventionally, certain ideas; such as, a\r\npeople obedient to their king, figured, metaphorically, by a bee;\r\nthe universe, conventionally, by a beetle. Third, _phonetic_, or\r\nrepresentative of sounds; that is to say, strictly alphabetical\r\ncharacters. The phonetic signs were also portraits of physical and\r\nmaterial objects; and each stood for the initial sound of the word in\r\nthe Egyptian language which expressed the object pourtrayed: thus a\r\nlion was the sound L, because a lion was called Labo; and a hand a T,\r\nbecause a hand was called Tot. The form in which these objects were\r\npresented, when employed as phonetic characters, was conventional,\r\nand _definite_ to distinguish them from the same objects used either\r\nfiguratively or symbolically; thus, the conventional form of the\r\nphonetic T was the hand open and outstretched; in any other form\r\nthe hand would either be a figurative, or a symbolic sign. The\r\nnumber of distinct characters employed as phonetic signs appears to\r\nhave been about 120; consequently many were homophones, or having\r\nthe same signification. The three kinds of characters were used\r\nindiscriminately in the same writing, [p177] and occasionally in the\r\ncomposition of the same word. The formal Egyptian writing, therefore,\r\nsuch as we see it still existing on the monuments of the country, was\r\na series of portraits of physical and material objects, of which a\r\nsmall proportion had a symbolic meaning, a still smaller proportion a\r\nfigurative meaning, but the great body were phonetic or alphabetical\r\nsigns: and to these portraits, sculptured or painted with sufficient\r\nfidelity to leave no doubt of the object represented, the name of\r\nhieroglyphics, or sacred characters, has been attached from their\r\nearliest historic notice.\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts of the same ancient period make us acquainted with\r\ntwo other forms of writing practised by the ancient Egyptians, both\r\napparently distinct from the hieroglyphic, but which, on careful\r\nexamination, are found to be its immediate derivatives; every\r\nhieroglyphic having its corresponding sign in the _hieratic_, or\r\nwriting of the priests, in which the funeral rituals, forming a\r\nlarge portion of the manuscripts, are principally composed; and in\r\nthe _demotic_, called also the _enchorial_, which was employed for\r\nall more ordinary and popular usages. The characters of the hieratic\r\nare for the most part obvious running imitations, or abridgments\r\nof the corresponding hieroglyphics; but in the demotic, which is\r\nstill further removed from the original type, the derivation is less\r\nfrequently and less obviously traceable. In the hieratic, fewer\r\nfigurative or symbolic signs are employed than in the hieroglyphic;\r\ntheir absence being supplied by means of the phonetic or alphabetical\r\ncharacters, the words being spelt instead of figured; and this is\r\nstill more the case in the demotic, which is, in consequence, almost\r\nentirely alphabetical.\r\n\r\nAfter the conversion of the Egyptians to Christianity, the ancient\r\nmode of writing their language fell into disuse; and an alphabet was\r\nadopted in substitution, consisting of the twenty-five Greek letters,\r\nwith six additional signs expressing articulations and aspirations\r\nunknown to the Greeks, the characters for which were retained from\r\nthe demotic. This is the Coptic alphabet, in which the Egyptian\r\nappears as a written language in the Coptic books and manuscripts\r\npreserved in our libraries; and in which, consequently, the language\r\nof the inscriptions on the monuments may be studied. [p178]\r\n\r\nThe original mode in which the language was written having thus\r\nfallen into disuse, it happened, at length, that the signification\r\nof the characters, and even the nature of the system of writing\r\nwhich they formed, became entirely lost; such notices on the subject\r\nas existed in the early historians being either too imperfect,\r\nor appearing too vague, to furnish a clue, although frequently\r\nand carefully studied for the purpose. The repossession of this\r\nknowledge will form, in literary history, one of the most remarkable\r\ndistinctions, if not the principal, of the age in which we live.\r\nIt is due primarily to the discovery by the French, during their\r\npossession of Egypt, of the since well-known monument called the\r\nRosetta Stone, which, on their defeat and expulsion by the British\r\ntroops, remained in the hands of the victors, was conveyed to\r\nEngland, and deposited in the British Museum. On this monument\r\nthe same inscription is repeated in the Greek and in the Egyptian\r\nlanguage, being written in the latter both in hieroglyphics and\r\nin the demotic or enchorial character. The words Ptolemy and\r\nCleopatra, written in hieroglyphics, and recognized by means of\r\nthe corresponding Greek of the Rosetta inscription, and by a Greek\r\ninscription on the base of an obelisk at Philæ, gave the phonetic\r\ncharacters of the letters which form those words: by their means the\r\nnames were discovered, in hieroglyphic writing, on other monuments of\r\nall the Grecian kings and Grecian queens of Egypt, and of fourteen\r\nof the Roman emperors ending with Commodus; and by the comparison\r\nof these names one with another, the value of all the phonetic\r\ncharacters was finally ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe hieroglyphic alphabet thus made out has been subsequently\r\napplied to the elucidation of the earlier periods of Egyptian\r\nhistory, particularly in tracing the reigns and the succession of\r\nthe Pharaohs, those native princes who governed Egypt at the period\r\nof its splendour; when its monarchy was the most powerful among the\r\nnations of the earth; its people the most advanced in learning, and\r\nin the cultivation of the arts and sciences; and which has left, as\r\nits memorials, constructions more nearly approaching to imperishable,\r\nthan any other of the works of man, which have been the wonder of\r\nevery succeeding people, and which are now serving to re-establish,\r\nat the expiration of above 3000 years, the details of [p179] its\r\nlong-forgotten history. To trace these stupendous monuments of art\r\nto their respective founders, and thus to fix, approximatively, at\r\nleast, the epoch of their first existence, is a consequence of the\r\nrestoration of the knowledge of the alphabet and the language of the\r\ninscriptions engraven on them. We propose to review, briefly as our\r\nlimits require, the principal and most important facts that have thus\r\nrecently been made known in regard to those early times; and shall\r\ndeem ourselves most fortunate if we can impart to our readers but\r\na small portion of the interest which we have ourselves derived in\r\nwatching their progressive discovery.\r\n\r\nThe following are the authors to whom we are chiefly indebted for\r\nthe few particulars we know of early Egyptian history. Herodotus\r\nand Diodorus Siculus, Grecians, and foreigners in Egypt. Manetho, a\r\nnative; and Eratosthenes, by birth a Cyrenean, a province bordering\r\non Egypt, both residents. Josephus, a Jew, and Africanus, Eusebius,\r\nand Syncellus, Christians, Greek authors. Herodotus visited Egypt\r\nfour centuries and a half before Christ, and within a century after\r\nits conquest by the Persians. In his relation of the affairs of\r\nthe Greeks and Persians, he has introduced incidentally a sketch\r\nof the early history of Egypt, such as he learnt it from popular\r\ntradition, and from information obtained from the priests. It is,\r\nhowever, merely a sketch, particularly of the earlier times; and\r\nis further recorded by Josephus to have been censured by Manetho\r\nfor its incorrectness. Diodorus is also understood to have visited\r\nEgypt about half a century before Christ; and from him we have a\r\nsimilar sketch to that of Herodotus; a record of the names of the\r\nmost distinguished kings, and for what they were distinguished;\r\nbut with intervals, of many generations and of uncertain duration,\r\npassed without notice. Manetho was a priest of Heliopolis in Lower\r\nEgypt, a city of the first rank amongst the sacred cities of ancient\r\nEgypt, and long the resort of foreigners as the seat of learning\r\nand knowledge. He lived in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, two\r\ncenturies and a half before Christ, and wrote, by order of that\r\nprince, the history of his own country in the Greek language,\r\ntranslating it, as he states himself, out of the sacred records.\r\nHis work is, most unfortunately, lost; but the fragments which have\r\nbeen preserved to us, by the writings [p180] of Josephus in the\r\nfirst century of the Christian æra, and by the Greek authors above\r\nnamed of the third and fourth centuries, contain matter, which, if\r\nentitled to confidence, is of the highest historical value, _viz._,\r\na chronological list of the successive rulers of Egypt, from the\r\nfirst foundation of monarchy, to Alexander of Macedon, who succeeded\r\nthe Persians. This list is divided into thirty dynasties, not all of\r\nseparate families; a memorable reign appearing in some instances to\r\ncommence a new dynasty, although happening in the regular succession.\r\nIt originally contained the length of reign as well as the name\r\nof every king; but in consequence of successive transcriptions,\r\nvariations have crept in, and some few omissions also occur in\r\nthe record, as it has reached us through the medium of different\r\nauthors. The chronology of Manetho, adopted with confidence by some,\r\nand rejected with equal confidence by others,—his name and his\r\ninformation not being even noticed by some of the modern systematic\r\nwriters on Egyptian history,—has received the most unquestionable\r\nand decisive testimony of its general fidelity by the interpretation\r\nof the hieroglyphic inscriptions on the existing monuments: so much\r\nso, that by the accordance of the facts attested by these monuments\r\nwith the record of the historian, we have reason to expect the entire\r\nrestoration of the annals of the Egyptian monarchy antecedent to the\r\nPersian conquest, and which, indeed, is already accomplished in part.\r\n\r\nBefore we pursue this part of our subject, we must conclude our\r\nbrief review of the original authorities in early Egyptian history,\r\nby a notice of Eratosthenes. He was keeper of the Alexandrian\r\nlibrary in the reign of Ptolemy Evergetes, the successor to Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, under whose reign Manetho wrote. Amongst the few\r\nfragments of his works, which have reached us transmitted through\r\nthe Greek historians, is a catalogue of thirty-eight kings of\r\nThebes, commencing with Menes, (who is mentioned by the other\r\nauthorities also as the first monarch of Egypt,) and occupying by\r\ntheir successive reigns 1055 years. These names are stated to have\r\nbeen compiled from original records existing at Thebes, which city\r\nEratosthenes visited expressly to consult them. The names of the two\r\nfirst kings in his catalogue are the same with the names of the two\r\nfirst kings of the first dynasty of Manetho; but the [p181] remainder\r\nof the catalogue presents no further accordance, either in the names\r\nor in the duration of the reigns.\r\n\r\nTo return to Manetho:—amongst the monarchs of the original Egyptian\r\nrace there was one named by him Amenophis, (the eighth king of the\r\neighteenth dynasty,) of whom it is stated, in a note of Manetho’s\r\npreserved by Syncellus, that he was the Egyptian king whom the Greeks\r\ncalled Memnon. The statue of Memnon at Thebes, celebrated through\r\nall antiquity for the melodious sounds which it was said to render\r\nat sunrise, is identified in the present day by a multitude of Greek\r\ninscriptions; one of which, in particular, records the attestation of\r\nPublius Balbinus, who visited the ruins of Thebes in the suite of the\r\nempress the wife of Adrian, to his having himself heard the “divine\r\nsounds of Memnon or Phamenoph;” which latter name is Amenophis, with\r\nthe Egyptian masculine article φ prefixed, and omitting the Greek\r\ntermination. The hieroglyphics carved on the statue, and coeval\r\nwith its date, had been very carefully copied by the French whilst\r\nin possession of Egypt, and were engraved in the splendid work, the\r\n_Description de l’Egypte_, to which their researches had given rise.\r\nThese hieroglyphics contain the alphabetic characters Amnf (being the\r\ninitial vowel and all the consonants of the name Amenof) inclosed\r\nwithin a ring; a distinction which had been previously observed to\r\ntake place with the names of the Roman emperors, and of the Grecian\r\nkings and queens; and as the rings have hitherto been found to occur\r\nin no other instance whatsoever than when containing the names and\r\ntitles of sovereigns, they are regarded as characteristic signs.\r\nIt should be remarked, that in the hieroglyphic writing, as in the\r\nlanguages of other eastern nations most nearly connected with Egypt,\r\nthe vowels are often omitted, and when expressed, have not always a\r\nfixed sound. The coincidence of the reading of the hieroglyphic name\r\nwith that recorded by Manetho, and with the Greek inscription on\r\nthe statue itself, was so far confirmatory of Manetho’s authority;\r\nit was also highly interesting in the evidence it afforded of the\r\nemployment of the same hieroglyphic alphabet, that was in after\r\nuse in the times of the Ptolemies and the Cæsars, even in the very\r\nearly periods of the Egyptian monarchy; for the reign of Amenophis\r\nwas in the dynasty preceding that of Sesostris: it also indicated\r\nthe further [p182] advantage to be gained by the application of\r\nthe alphabet in decyphering other proper names, distinguished by\r\nbeing inclosed in rings, existing on other statues, and in the more\r\nancient temples generally. Considerable progress had been made\r\nin reading these, which in several instances had been found to\r\ncorrespond with the names of the kings of the same and of subsequent\r\ndynasties to Amenophis, as given by Manetho, when a most important\r\ndiscovery was made of the existence of a genealogical record, in\r\nhieroglyphics, of the titles of thirty-nine kings anterior to\r\nSesostris, chronologically arranged. We have already noticed that the\r\nnames and _titles_ of kings were distinguished by being inclosed in\r\nrings; the ring containing the proper name being accompanied usually\r\nby a second, inclosing certain other hieroglyphics, expressing the\r\ntitle by which that particular king was designated; and it appears\r\nprobable that the kings of Egypt were distinguished by their titles\r\nrather than by their names, since the same name recurs frequently\r\nin different individuals, but the titles are all dissimilar; with\r\na single exception amongst the very many that have come under\r\nobservation, and in which the same title is common to two brothers.\r\nThe signification of the titles is yet obscure, except that they are\r\nof the same general nature as is frequent in the East, such as “Sun\r\nof the Universe,” &c.; but for the purpose of individualizing, the\r\nsign is to us of the same value as the thing signified; and as other\r\nmonuments furnish the _names_ in connexion with the _titles_, we are\r\nenabled to compare the succession evidenced by the titles with the\r\nrecord of the historian, and thus to test the fidelity of the record.\r\nThe discovery of this hieroglyphic table was made by Mr. William\r\nBanks in 1818, in excavating for the purpose of obtaining an accurate\r\nground-plan of the ruins of Abydus, near Thebes. On a side wall\r\nof one of the innermost apartments, hieroglyphics were sculptured\r\ninclosed in rings, ranged symmetrically in three horizontal rows,\r\neach row having originally contained twenty rings, of which twelve\r\nof the upper row, eighteen of the middle, and fourteen of the lower\r\nrow were still remaining, the others having been destroyed by the\r\nbreaking down of the wall. The hieroglyphics having been copied\r\nand lithographed, it was speedily recognised that the rings in the\r\ntwo upper rows consisted of titles only; with the exception of one\r\n[p183] proper name, the last of the second row, since known to be\r\nthe name of the king whose title is the last in the succession, and\r\nwho was the fourth in reign and generation before Sesostris. The\r\nthird row was recognised to consist of one proper name and one title,\r\neach repeated ten times, and alternating with each other: these are\r\nsince known to be the name and title of Sesostris, to whose reign\r\nthe construction of the table is with much probability ascribed. The\r\ntitles in the same row with that of the ancestor of Sesostris and\r\npreceding it, have been identified on other monuments, coupled with\r\nnames which are those of the predecessors of the same king in the\r\nlist of Manetho.\r\n\r\nIt would exceed our limits, and it is not our purpose, to trace\r\nin detail the successive steps by which the existence of each of\r\nthe kings of Manetho’s list, from the expulsion of the Phœnician\r\nshepherds from Lower Egypt, and the consequent union of Upper and\r\nLower Egypt in a single monarchy, to the reign of Sesostris, has been\r\nattested by the monuments. Suffice it to say, that the same number of\r\nindividuals as stated by Manetho, namely, eighteen, filling a space\r\nof four centuries, are shown, by the monuments, to have reigned in\r\nthat interval, and to have borne the same relationship, as well as\r\nsuccession, to each other, as is expressed by the historian: that,\r\nof the eighteen names, eight in different parts of the list are read\r\non the monuments identically as in the historical record; and that\r\nin regard to the names that are not identical, we have the testimony\r\nof Manetho that some amongst the kings, Sesostris, for example, were\r\nknown by two and even by more names. The table of Abydus appears to\r\nhave been strictly a genealogical record; a record of generations, in\r\nwhich view it is strictly accordant with the historian.\r\n\r\nThe period of the Egyptian annals on which this light has been\r\nthrown, is precisely that which might have been selected in the\r\nwhole history of Egypt as the most desirable for such purpose.\r\nIndependently of its very high antiquity, it was the period of the\r\ngreatest splendour and power of the native Egyptian monarchy, and\r\nof the highest (Egyptian) cultivation of the arts. The greater part\r\nof the more ancient, and by far the most admirable in execution,\r\nof the temples, palaces, and statues, which still attest by their\r\nruins their former magnificence, are the work of that age; and\r\nthe hieroglyphic inscriptions still [p184] extant on them, and\r\nwhich, when not defaced by wanton injury, are almost as perfect\r\nas when first executed, make known the reigns in which they were\r\nrespectively constructed, and frequently the purposes for which\r\nthey were designed. This is in itself no small achievement, when we\r\nreflect that these extraordinary remains of ancient art were equally\r\nthe objects of vague wonderment in the times of the Roman emperors,\r\nas they were in those of the generation preceding ourselves; but\r\nthat they are become to us objects of a more enlightened curiosity,\r\nwhich they promise amply to repay, when the study that has already\r\nmade known their founders, shall reveal the signification of the\r\nhieroglyphic histories, with which the walls of the palaces and\r\ntemples are covered. Already have we gained some very important\r\nfacts in regard to the condition, political and otherwise, of the\r\ncountries adjoining to Egypt at that early period. The monuments\r\nof Nubia are covered with hieroglyphics, perfectly similar both in\r\nform and disposition to those on the edifices at Thebes; the same\r\nelements, the same formulæ, the same language; and the names of the\r\nkings who elevated the most ancient amongst them, are those of the\r\nprinces who constructed the most ancient parts of the palace of\r\nKarnac at Thebes. As far as Soleb on the Nile, 100 leagues to the\r\nsouth of Philæ the extreme frontier of Egypt, are found constructions\r\nbearing the inscriptions of an Egyptian king; evidencing that, during\r\nthe period of which we have been treating, Nubia was inhabited by\r\na people having the same language, the same belief, and the same\r\nkings as Egypt. To the south of Soleb, and for more than 100 leagues\r\nin ascending the Nile, in ancient Ethiopia, very recent travellers\r\nhave discovered the remains of temples, of the same general style\r\nof architecture as those of Nubia and Egypt, decorated in the\r\nsame manner with hieroglyphics representing the same mythology,\r\nand analogous to those of Egypt in the titles, and in the mode\r\nof representing the names and titles, of the sovereigns. But the\r\nproper names of the kings inscribed on the edifices of Ethiopia in\r\nphonetic characters, have nothing in common with the proper names of\r\nthe Egyptian kings in the dynasties of Manetho; nor is one of the\r\nEthiopian names found either on the monuments of Nubia or of Egypt.\r\nThus there was a time when the civilized part of Ethiopia,—Meroe,\r\nand the banks [p185] of the Nile between Dongola and Meroe,—were\r\ninhabited by a people having language, writing, religion, and arts\r\nsimilar to Egypt; but, in political dominion, independent of that\r\ncountry, and ruled by kings of whom it does not appear that any\r\nhistorical record whatsoever has come down to us.\r\n\r\nThe dates of the expulsion of the Phœnican shepherds from Egypt, and\r\nof the reign of Sesostris, in years of the æra of our computation,\r\nhave been favourite subjects of discussion with chronologists:\r\nArchbishop Usher fixed the former of these events in the year B. C.\r\n1825; which would make the commencement of the reign of Sesostris\r\nabout B. C. 1483. The reign of Sesostris is connected with the\r\nearly Grecian chronology by the migration of Danaus, brother of\r\nSesostris, who, according to the Parian marbles, arrived in Greece\r\nin 1485, which is a very few years earlier than the dates of Usher\r\nwould assign to that event. M. Champollion Figeac, brother of the M.\r\nChampollion to whom the greater part of the discoveries made by the\r\ninterpretation of hieroglyphics are owing, himself a distinguished\r\nchronologist, has assigned the year B.C. 1822 to the expulsion\r\nof the Phœnicians, which Usher had placed in 1825: the date of\r\nM. Champollion being derived from Manetho’s statement, that the\r\nPhœnician invasion took place in the 700th year of the Sothiacal\r\nperiod, _viz._, B.C. 2082, and that their dominion in Egypt continued\r\n260 years. Historical accuracy may make it desirable, that the exact\r\nyear of the most ancient as well as of more modern events should be\r\ndetermined, if it be possible: but for purposes of general interest,\r\nand especially for comparison with the chronology of cotemporary\r\nnations, which at that early period is in every case more unsettled\r\nthan the Egyptian, the period seems sufficiently determined. The\r\ndate before Christ 1822, pursued downwards through the dynasties\r\nof Manetho, conducts with very close approximation to the known\r\nperiod B.C. 525 of the conquest of Egypt by the Persians; and\r\nintermediately, accords very satisfactorily with the dates, according\r\nto the Bible chronology, of the conquest of Jerusalem in the reign of\r\nJeroboam by Shishak, king of Egypt, and of Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia\r\nand Egypt, who made war against Sennacherib; these are the Sesonchis\r\nof Manetho, and Sh.sh.n.k of hieroglyphic inscriptions on a temple at\r\nBubaste, and on one of the courts of the [p186] palace at Karnac,—and\r\nthe Taracus of Manetho, and T.h.r.k of hieroglyphic inscriptions\r\nexisting in Ethiopia and in Egypt[33].\r\n\r\nIn respect to the connexion of the events of the Jewish and Egyptian\r\nhistories, the period between the expulsion of the Phœnicians and the\r\nreign of Sesostris possesses a peculiar interest, as being that of\r\nthe residence of the Israelites in Egypt, and of the Exodus. In the\r\nhistory of Josephus, we have an extract from Manetho, in which this\r\nlatter event is expressly stated to have taken place under the father\r\nof Sesostris, a king whose name, in Manetho’s list, is Amenophis,\r\n(the third of that name,) and on the monuments Ramses. The date which\r\nchronologists are generally agreed in assigning to the Exodus is\r\n1491; that of the termination of the reign of Amenophis, according\r\nto Champollion, is 1473, or, if the correction of his chronology\r\nwhich we have suggested in a note be just, 1478: it is singular that\r\nthe difference of thirteen years (between 1491 and 1478) should be\r\nprecisely the duration of a very suspicious interval which Manetho\r\nstates to have taken place, after Amenophis had gone with his army\r\nin pursuit of the Israelites; and during which interval neither the\r\nking nor his army returned to [p187] Egypt, but are stated to have\r\nbeen absent in Ethiopia. If the Exodus occurred during the reign of\r\nany of the kings of the eighteenth dynasty, it could only have been\r\nin the reign of the immediate predecessor of Sesostris; since his\r\nconquests in Phœnicia, and his expeditions against the Assyrians and\r\nMedes, must have brought him in contact with the Israelites, had they\r\nbeen then residing in the Holy Land, so as at least to have caused\r\nsome mention to have been made in their history of the passages of so\r\ngreat a conqueror. But presuming Amenophis, father and predecessor\r\nof Sesostris, to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus, the wandering\r\nof the Israelites in the desert for forty of the fifty-five years\r\nascribed to the reign of Sesostris, is a sufficient explanation\r\nof his being unnoticed in the Jewish history; whilst the fact of\r\nthat nation having been subject to the Egyptians during the reign\r\nof Ousirei, commencing 124 years before the death of Amenophis, is\r\nattested by the paintings on the wall of one of the chambers of the\r\ntomb of that king, discovered by Belzoni, and with which we are so\r\nwell acquainted by means of the model exhibited in England.\r\n\r\nWhilst recalling to recollection the peculiar physiognomy of the Jews\r\npourtrayed in that tomb,—and which is as characteristic of their\r\npresent physiognomy as if it had been painted in the present age,\r\ninstead of above 3000 years ago,—the equally well characterized, but\r\nvery different physiognomy of the Phœnician shepherds, represented\r\non the monuments of the same period, is decisive of the error of\r\nJosephus, who imagined the Jews and the Shepherds to be the same\r\npeople. The Phœnician shepherds, long the inveterate enemy of the\r\nEgyptians, form a leading feature as captives, in the representations\r\nof the exploits of the monarchs who conducted the warfare against\r\nthem. These people are always painted with blue eyes and light\r\nhair; and it is not a little curious to see assembled on the wall\r\nof the same apartment, different races, so distinctly characterised\r\nas the Jew, the Phœnician, the Egyptian, and the Negro; the latter\r\nin colour, and in the outline of the features, in painting and in\r\nsculpture, precisely as at present; all, moreover, inhabitants of\r\ncountries not very distant from each other, and at a period when not\r\nmore than twelve or thirteen centuries had passed since all these\r\nraces had descended from a single parent. In the writings which\r\nattempt to explain from natural causes [p188] the diversity of race\r\namongst mankind, much power has been ascribed to the effects of time\r\nand climate: but the facts with which we are now becoming better\r\nacquainted than before, do not appear to admit of explanation from\r\nthose circumstances. It is worthy of notice that the negro, and the\r\nlight-haired and blue-eyed people, the two races who might be deemed\r\nat the greatest distance apart amongst the varieties of man, are,\r\nequally with the intermediate Egyptians, the descendants of Ham.\r\n\r\nOf the succession of kings in Manetho’s chronology, from Sesostris to\r\nthe Persian conquest, a space of nine centuries and a half, about one\r\nhalf the names have been already identified on different monuments:\r\nfour of the Persian monarchs, subsequent to the conquest, have also\r\nbeen traced in inscriptions in phonetic characters; their names\r\nare written, as nearly as can be spelt with our letters, Kamboth,\r\n(Cambyses); Ntariousch, (Darius); Khschearscha, (Xerxes); and\r\nArtakschessch, (Artaxerxes.)\r\n\r\nThe ascent by monumental evidence to yet more remote antiquity\r\nthan the expulsion of the Phœnician shepherds, (B.C. 1822), is not\r\naltogether without hope, notwithstanding the general demolition of\r\nthe temples of the gods, which took place according to Manetho,\r\nduring the long dominion of the Phœnicians in Egypt. We learn from\r\nthe _Description de l’Egypte_ that even the most ancient structures\r\nat Thebes are themselves composed of the debris of still more ancient\r\nbuildings, used as simple materials, on which previously sculptured\r\nand painted hieroglyphics are still existing; these are doubtless the\r\nremains of the demolished temples, but the inscriptions will require\r\nto be studied on the spot. There is also reason to believe, that\r\nthere exists amongst the ruins of the palace of Karnac, a portion of\r\nstill more ancient construction than the palace itself; which, having\r\nescaped demolition, was incorporated with the more recent building.\r\nThe inscriptions on this apparently very ancient ruin present the\r\nname and title of a king, which form a very interesting subject for\r\nfuture elucidation. The title does not accord with any one now extant\r\non the table of Abydus, but possibly may have been one of those which\r\nwere destroyed with a portion of the wall, and which are of kings\r\nof earlier date than the expulsion of the shepherds. The name is\r\nMandouei, which name occurs in the dynasty anterior to Sesostris, but\r\ncoupled [p189] with a different title, an effectual distinction; nor\r\ndoes the name recur in any subsequent dynasty. M. Champollion Figeac\r\nhas, with much ingenuity, shown the probability of the identity of\r\nthe Mandouei of the ancient ruin with the Osymandyas, Ousi-Mandouei,\r\nmentioned by Diodorus Siculus as an Egyptian king greatly\r\ndistinguished by his conquests, whose reign M. Champollion infers,\r\nfrom the historical passages relating to him, to have commenced 190\r\nyears before the Phœnician invasion, or B.C. 2272 years; a prodigious\r\nantiquity, and of the very highest interest should it be established,\r\nsince there exist of this individual no less than three statues in\r\nEuropean collections, distinguished by the same name and title: two\r\nof these are colossal, one at Turin, and a second at Rome: a third\r\nis in the British Museum; and as all particulars must interest which\r\nrelate to a statue, of which there is at least probability that is\r\nthe most ancient existing in the world,—the date attributed to it\r\nbeing earlier than the birth of Abraham,—we copy from Burckhardt the\r\nfollowing short description of its discovery: “Within the inclosure\r\nof the interior part of the temple at Karnac, Belzoni found a statue\r\nof a hard, large-grained sandstone: a whole length naked figure\r\nsitting upon a chair with a ram’s head upon the knees: the face and\r\nbody entire; with plaited hair falling down to the shoulders. This\r\nis one of the first, I should say, the first Egyptian statue I have\r\nseen: the expression of the face is exquisite, and I believe it to be\r\na portrait.”—(J. L. BURCKHARDT, _Travels in Nubia_, lxxvii. _Letter\r\nto Mr. W. Hamilton, 20th February, 1817_.)—This statue is in the\r\nfarthest corner on the right hand side after entering the gallery\r\nof the Egyptian antiquities in the British Museum; and compared\r\nwith other statues in the same gallery, which are of kings of the\r\neighteenth dynasty, the dissimilarity of the features from the very\r\ncharacteristic ones of the latter family is too striking to be\r\nquestioned. The problem of the age of this king Mandouei is, at all\r\nevents, a highly curious one; and will probably receive its solution\r\namongst the many other valuable discoveries which cannot fail to\r\nresult from M. Champollion’s projected visit to Egypt, in which\r\nhe will be accompanied by the sincere good wishes of every one in\r\nevery country, who feels an interest in the restoration of authentic\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n E. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [33] It appears to us that a slight inaccuracy has crept into the\r\n deduction of all the dates in M. Champollion’s Chronology subsequent\r\n to the expulsion of the shepherds. The date of that event is the\r\n foundation of the subsequent dates, and is supposed to have taken\r\n place B.C. 1822; after which, according to the extract of Manetho in\r\n Josephus cited by M. Champollion, Thoutmosis, the king by whom they\r\n had been expelled, reigned 25 years and 4 months, followed by the\r\n other kings of the eighteenth dynasty, making altogether 342 years\r\n and 9 months: (including the 2 years and 2 months additional of\r\n Horus, in compliance with the version of the passage in the Armenian\r\n text of the Chronicle of Eusebius.) This number, 342 years and 9\r\n months, falling short of the 348 years attributed to the eighteenth\r\n dynasty in Eusebius and Syncellus, M. Champollion has suggested that\r\n Thoutmosis may have reigned the five years which constitute the\r\n difference, before the expulsion of the shepherds, since, according\r\n to the record, he did reign, some years before that event, over\r\n all the parts of Egypt not possessed by the shepherds. So far, so\r\n well: but in such case, the year B.C. 1822, being the epoch of the\r\n expulsion of the shepherds, and not of the commencement of the\r\n eighteenth dynasty, must surely correspond to the fifth year of the\r\n reign of Thoutmosis, and not to the first, as M. Champollion makes\r\n it. We have hesitated to venture this remark on a matter to which M.\r\n Champollion must have given much attention, believing that mistake\r\n in us is much more probable than an accidental inadvertence in\r\n him; but we have returned frequently to the consideration, without\r\n having been able to satisfy ourselves; and the rectification of our\r\n mistake, if it is one, may prevent others falling into the same.\r\n [p190]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Proceedings of the Horticultural Society_.\r\n\r\n _June 19th_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this meeting a paper was read from the President, T. A. Knight,\r\nEsq., upon the culture of the mango and cherimoyer. Its object was to\r\nsuggest some improvements in the management of these and other trees\r\ncultivated in stoves, deduced from an application of Dutrochet’s\r\nelectrical theory of vegetation to practice. It has now become\r\ngenerally known that this observer is of opinion that the motion\r\nof the fluids in plants depends upon two currents of electricity,\r\nsetting with very unequal force between the denser fluid of the tree\r\nand the lighter fluid of the soil in which the tree is planted; the\r\nmore powerful current setting from the latter to the former, and\r\nso producing absorption, by conveying aqueous particles into the\r\nroots, through the vegetable membrane of the epidermis. In applying\r\nthis theory to practical purposes, Mr. Knight recommends that the\r\npot in which the cherimoyer or mango is planted, should itself be\r\nsurrounded by a medium through which an equable and regular supply\r\nof fluid may be conveyed to the roots, and that the naked surface\r\nof the pot should by no means be exposed to the free action of the\r\natmosphere. Without entering upon any question of the accuracy of\r\nthe French philosopher’s observations, it is quite certain that such\r\na mode of cultivation is that which is most congenial to plants,\r\nand which is indispensable to those of a habit at all delicate. The\r\ncommon practice of plunging pots into a tan-bed, or among sand, if\r\nin glass-houses, or in the earth if in open borders, is a proof of\r\nthe necessity that gardeners have found, of securing as regular a\r\ntemperature and degree of humidity as is possible for the outside of\r\ntheir flower-pots; through the pores in which, moisture is chiefly\r\nconveyed to the roots, which always cling to the inside surface of\r\nthe pot.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of roses produced by branches budded upon the Rosa indica,\r\nwere exhibited by Alexander Evelyn, Esq. We notice these not only\r\non account of their extraordinary beauty, but also for the sake\r\nof recommending most strongly the adoption of the practice where\r\ndelicate roses are found difficult of cultivation _per se_. If we\r\nconsider what happens when the operation of budding, or grafting\r\nhas succeeded, the reason of the advantage derived from such an\r\noperation will be apparent. When a bud of one variety is inserted\r\nunder the bark of another variety, a union takes place between the\r\ncellular substance of the two; the bud is then placed in the same\r\n[p191] situation with regard to the stock, as the seed when sown\r\nis with regard to the earth. It immediately derives its nutriment\r\nfrom the ascending sap of the new tree, and begins to form its wood\r\nand branches, and to secrete its proper juices in proportion to the\r\nsupply of food it now receives. If a plant from any cause produces\r\nroots with difficulty, its whole habit will be delicate, and its\r\nflowers if formed, will, as in the case of that most lovely of\r\nflowers, the double yellow rose, probably fall off without expanding,\r\nfrom the want of an adequate supply of nutriment from its roots;\r\nbut, as in all trees, every bud is, when fully formed, in itself a\r\nperfect and distinct individual, if such an individual be removed\r\nfrom its own root, and placed where it will be supported by the\r\nhealthy vigorous roots of another species of variety, which happens\r\nin budding, it will no longer have to depend upon a source, the\r\nsupplies from which are imperfect, but on the contrary, like a seed\r\nremoved from barren fertile ground, it will flourish in a degree\r\nbefore unknown. The contrary effect takes place when a vigorous plant\r\nis transferred to one less vigorous. And hence, the whole effect of\r\nstocks upon the scions, or buds inserted upon them.\r\n\r\nThere was also a great variety of fruit and flowers upon the table,\r\nand seeds of several useful vegetables were distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n _July 3rd_.\r\n\r\nSeven medals were awarded to different individuals for fruit sent\r\nby them to the Society’s fête on the 23rd of June; and one to Capt.\r\nDrummond, for his “successful exertions in bringing living plants of\r\nthe mangosteen from the East Indies.” A paper by the president was\r\nread upon an improvement in the mode of constructing hotbeds, but we\r\ndespair of explaining it successfully without reference to figures.\r\nAmong the display of fruits and flowers, which were exceedingly\r\nnumerous, we were particularly struck by a collection of twenty-two\r\nvarieties of strawberries from the Society’s garden.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion, thirty-nine new members were either ballotted\r\nfor, or proposed, a striking proof of the estimation in which the\r\nSociety is held by the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n _July 17th_.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion, an enormous pine-cone from the River Columbia\r\nwas exhibited. It measured 16-1/2 inches in length, and was stated\r\nto have been procured by the Society’s collector, Mr. David Douglas.\r\nIts seeds were represented to be as large as those of the stone-pine,\r\nand eatable. The tree is of the family of Pinus strobus, [p192] and\r\nwill be an invaluable acquisition to our forests, if it should prove\r\nto succeed as well in this climate as in its own. We have already\r\ngiven some account of this plant in the last number of the old series\r\nof this Journal. The usual display was made of the finest fruit and\r\nflowers of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n _August 7th_.\r\n\r\nA complete coloured set of the costly Flora danica was placed upon\r\nthe table, having been presented by His Majesty the King of Denmark.\r\nAn improved apparatus for fumigating hothouses was exhibited by its\r\ninventor, Mr. John Read: it consists of a brass cylinder, attached to\r\nthe orifice of a pair of bellows, and fitted up with a chimney and\r\ndraft-hole closed by a valve. The tobacco is put into the cylinder\r\nand ignited, and the blast from the bellows expels the smoke.\r\nThe contrivance is ingenious enough, but while a hot-house fifty\r\nfeet long, may be filled with smoke in ten minutes by means of a\r\nflower-pot, with a hole in its bottom, and a common pair of bellows,\r\nwe cannot recommend any more expensive, and certainly less efficient\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThe table was covered with a profusion of fruits and flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n _August 21st_.\r\n\r\nThe meeting-room this day exhibited a gratifying proof of the\r\nexcellence of the productions of our English gardens. Of _flowers_,\r\nthere were dahlias of the richest colours, and the most varied hues;\r\nsome produced by plants that retain all their ancient stature, and\r\nothers by dwarfs which seem to have lost nearly every character of\r\nthe dahlia but its beauty. Of _fruits_, there were endless varieties\r\nof apricots, apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, grapes, pine-apples,\r\nand melons; one of the latter, from the garden of John Fuller, Esq.,\r\nweighed thirteen pounds. The best apricot was the Moorpark; the best\r\napple, the Duchess of Oldenburg, than which no princess has a fairer\r\nbloom, the best pear the Jargonelle, the best peach the Bourdine\r\n(forced), the best pine apple the Black Jamaica. We mention these as\r\na guide to our readers, in their purchases of fruit-trees; for it is\r\ncertain, that no greater service can be rendered to the public, than\r\nto point out the means by which they may avoid encumbering themselves\r\nwith the polyonymous trash with which every nursery abounds. [p193]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n MISCELLANEOUS INTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n I. MECHANICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _On the combined Action of a Current of Air and the Pressure of\r\nthe Atmosphere_.—The phenomena observed by M. Clement Désormes[34],\r\nwhen a flat plate is opposed to air or vapour passing into the\r\natmosphere from an aperture in a plane surface, have been rendered\r\nso easy of production by M. Hachette, as to be at the command of\r\nany person in any situation. M. Hachette has also accompanied the\r\ndescription of his instruments with elucidations, experiments, and\r\nphilosophical reasonings.\r\n\r\nThe first simplification by M. Hachette was to make the nozzle of\r\na pair of double chamber-bellows terminate in the middle of a flat\r\nplate; he found that when the bellows were worked, effects were\r\nproduced opposite the jet of air of the kind described by M. Clement,\r\ndisks of card and other substances being drawn towards the aperture\r\nagainst the direction of the current. At the same time that he\r\ndescribed this experiment, he also announced his having produced the\r\nsame effects by using a stream of water instead of a stream of air.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 1.]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Fig._ 2.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus was still further simplified, so as to make the stream\r\nof air from the mouth sufficient to produce the effect. A tin tube,\r\nA, _Fig._ 1, was soldered to the middle of a round tin plate, in\r\nthe centre of which was a small orifice, E; three or four small\r\nprojections of the tin, _f f_, were left at the edges of the plate,\r\nto prevent the disks of paper, card, or metal, from slipping off\r\nsideways. The figure is on a scale of one-half. Instead of the tin\r\nplate, a piece [p194] of smooth cork may be used, and for the tin\r\ntube, a glass tube, or one made by rolling up a piece of paper.\r\n\r\nIf the tube be held horizontally, or inclining a little upward, and a\r\ndisk of card or paper be placed loosely against the aperture in the\r\nplate, it will be found that, on applying the mouth to the end of\r\nthe tube, and blowing air through, that the disk will not be driven\r\naway, but actually made to apply closely to the surface of the plate;\r\nand if turned towards the ground it will be found to remain opposite\r\nthe hole, and not to fall until the current of air is stopped. Even\r\na plate of tin may in this way be suspended by a current of air;\r\nwhich at first would be supposed to conjoin with gravity in forcing\r\nit to the ground. When the disk is flexible and slightly elastic, a\r\nheavy sound, and sometimes even a shrill tone, is produced by the\r\nvibrations of the plate.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of this experiment, M. Hachette says, “The air is\r\npushed from the mouth A of the tube, towards the orifice E of the\r\nplate; it strikes the part of the disk opposed to this orifice,\r\nand the mean pressure on that part is greater than the pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere. The blown air then takes place of that between the\r\nplate and the disk opposed to it; it moves in this interval with a\r\nvelocity decreasing from the edges of the aperture: the elastic force\r\nof this air decreases at the same time, so that its mean pressure\r\nbetween the plate and the inner face of the disk becomes less than\r\nthe atmospheric pressure; and as this last pressure is exerted on the\r\nwhole external face of the disk H, I, this disk, subject at the same\r\ntime to the two contrary pressures on its opposing faces, obeys the\r\ngreater, and is pushed towards the plate C D.”\r\n\r\n“It is not necessary that the disk, C D, should be near the orifice\r\nE, of the tube A E. Let _Fig._ 2 be an instrument composed of a\r\nhollow cylinder, C D F G, and a flat border of the dimensions C″ F,\r\nor G D″. Let a tube, A E, be fixed to the bottom of the cylinder,\r\nthe orifice E having a diameter of about three millimeters (0.12\r\nof inch). If air be blown in at A, against the disk, H I, in the\r\nneighbourhood of the flat border, the disk will be urged towards\r\nthe orifice E. This instrument is also delineated on a scale of one\r\nhalf. The disk, with the attached weight, weighs about 12 grammes\r\n(184.87 grains), being 54 millimeters in diameter; the pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere upon it equals 23 kilogrammes: from which it follows\r\nthat, in this experiment, the pressure of the air blown upon the\r\ninner surface of the disk, and the atmospheric pressure exerted on\r\nthe exterior of the same disk, only differs from each other by about\r\none two-thousandth part of the latter.”—_Annales de Chimie_, xxxv. 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [34] See the last volume of this Journal, p. 473.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Considerations relative to Capillary Action, by_ M. Poisson.—M.\r\nDutrochet, whilst explaining his views relative to the cause of\r\nvital movement in plants and animals, stated that if an animal or\r\nvegetable membrane were formed into a bag, having a tube of [p195]\r\nglass attached to its aperture, and were then filled with a liquid\r\nsubstance, having a strong affinity for another liquid, into which\r\nthe bag was to be immersed, it would not only have the power of\r\nabsorbing the latter liquid into its pores, but also, in certain\r\ncases, of forcing it up to the top, and even out of the glass tube\r\nheld in a vertical position. On this point, a difference of opinion\r\nwith regard to the force of capillarity took place: M. Ampère\r\nmaintaining that capillary action would raise the fluid to the top of\r\nthe tube, but not cause its expulsion; while M. Poisson maintained\r\nthat, in certain cases, the latter effect could be produced. The\r\nlatter has since then published a note, which we transcribe in part,\r\nfrom the _Annales de Chimie_, xxxv. 98.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: untitled, two vessels separated by a narrow canal]\r\n\r\nSuppose that two different fluids, A, B, are contained in a vessel,\r\nand separated the one from the other by a vertical division; the\r\nheights being in an inverse ratio to the densities, so that the\r\npoints, _a_ and _b_, in the two faces of the division, and situated\r\nin the same horizontal plane, shall support equal and opposite\r\npressures: suppose also that the division is pierced with one or more\r\nholes of small diameter, or, in other words, that it is traversed by\r\nseveral very narrow canals, as _a_, _b_, perpendicular to the two\r\nfaces, and which may be regarded at first as filled with air, or any\r\nother fluid.\r\n\r\nIf the substance of the division exerts upon each of the two liquids\r\nan action superior to the half of that which the liquid has upon\r\nitself, each liquid will enter into the canal _a_, _b_, just as it\r\nwould rise above its ordinary level in a capillary tube of the same\r\nsize and substance. It would also be urged, by the excess of pressure\r\nwhich it would exert at the extremity of the canal, against the\r\nelasticity of the included air. When the two fluids have penetrated\r\nthe interior of _a_, _b_, the air will be pushed on both sides\r\nin different directions by forces each of which is equal to the\r\nprimitive pressure augmented by the corresponding capillary force,\r\n_i. e._ augmented by forces proportional, according to the known\r\ntheory of M. Laplace, to double the action of the tube on the liquid,\r\nless the proper action of the liquid itself. It will only be in the\r\ncase when the capillary force shall be the same on both sides, that\r\nthe air, after being compressed to a certain degree, will remain at\r\nrest: for whenever this force preponderates at one end of the canal,\r\nthe air will be driven out at the opposite end, and the liquid with\r\nthe strongest capillary attraction will entirely fill the canal.\r\n\r\nSuppose this liquid to be A, then let us consider the forces which\r\nwill act on the portion _a_, _b_, of this liquid. At the extremity\r\n_a_, it will be submitted to the attraction of the exterior fluid\r\nA: at the extremity _b_, it will be attracted in the opposite\r\ndirection by the liquid B. Now the two liquids being different, their\r\nattractions will be unequal, and we will suppose that that of B, on\r\nthe matter [p196] of A, is greater than that of A for itself. As to\r\nthe action of the canal on the portion _a_, _b_, that will be equal,\r\nand exerted in contrary directions at its two extremities; it will\r\nnot, therefore, be either adverse or favourable to the movement of\r\nthe fluid in the canal: and the same will be the case with respect\r\nto the pressures exerted at _a_ and _b_, by the external liquids, as\r\nlong as they are equal: nevertheless, the action of the canal, and\r\nthe external pressures, will prevent the thread of fluid from being\r\nbroken, so that it will move without interruption in the direction\r\nin which it is drawn by the greatest attraction, or from _a_ to _b_.\r\nHence will result an elevation of the level of B, and, consequently,\r\nan increase of pressure at the extremity _b_, of the passage, and\r\nthis elevation will proceed until the difference of pressure in _a_\r\nand _b_ shall be equal to that of the attractions exerted by the two\r\nfluids A and B, on the thread _a b_; this effect will be produced\r\nthe more rapidly as the division is pierced with a greater number of\r\npassages similar to that which has been considered.\r\n\r\nNow let us examine what would occur if the division were formed\r\nof two others different in their nature, and exactly superposed;\r\nexerting no action on one of the liquids, B for example, and one\r\nonly acting on the other liquid. The liquid B will then retain its\r\noriginal position undisturbed; in consequence of the action it exerts\r\nupon itself it cannot penetrate the canal _a b_, just as mercury\r\ncannot escape by a capillary aperture made in a barometer-tube.\r\nIt will be the same with A, when that face of the division which\r\nexerts no action upon the liquid is turned towards it; so that how\r\nnumerous soever the apertures, the two liquids would, under such\r\ncircumstances, remain separate and preserve their original level. But\r\nif the division be turned so that the face which acts upon A shall\r\nbe in contact with that liquid, it will penetrate the canal _a b_\r\nby means of capillary attraction; and the velocity which the liquid\r\nurged by this force may acquire, may make it pass that point in the\r\ncanal where the division changes its nature, and even make it reach\r\nthe extremity in the liquid B, so that it is possible that the liquid\r\nA should entirely fill the canal _a b_, as in the case which has\r\nalready been examined. Then if we always suppose the attraction of B\r\nfor A to be superior to that which A has for itself, the thread _a\r\nb_ will flow into B until the level of the latter is so far altered\r\nthat the excess of pressure at _b_ can balance the difference of\r\nattractions exerted by the two liquids at _a_ and _b_.\r\n\r\nM. Poisson then observes that, without pretending to assign a cause,\r\nexclusive of all others, for the phenomena of absorption by vegetable\r\nand animal membranes observed by M. Dutrochet, his object is to\r\nshow that effects which have at least a great resemblance to these\r\nimportant phenomena, may be produced by capillary action conjoined\r\nwith the difference of affinity existing between heterogeneous\r\nsubstances without the assistance of electricity, either moving or\r\nquiescent. It appears that M. Dutrochet afterwards [p197] found\r\nmineral substances, as a piece of slate, might be substituted for the\r\norganized tissues; this being the case, the opinion which refers such\r\neffects to a general cause, as capillary attraction, acquires more\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Novel Use of the Plough_.—Mr. Bruckmann states that he has\r\nlong thought the plough might be used in levelling roads and\r\nclearing the foundations for fortifications. In 1824 he had an\r\nopportunity of applying it in the construction of a canal required\r\nto furnish a motive force for the service of the rock-salt works of\r\nFriedrichshall. The bed was to have a section of 700 square feet, and\r\nit had been calculated that the excavations would require 200 men for\r\ntwo years, whereas the king of Wurtemburg wished it to be done in one\r\nyear from the spring of 1824.\r\n\r\nThree ploughs were employed; the first had two handles, a coulter,\r\nand a share, the latter being in the form of a wedge. This plough\r\nwas preferred in the beds and gravelly grounds; and it was found\r\nadvantageous to give it an oscillatory movement by the handles during\r\nits progress. Drawn by eight horses, it could turn up 25,000 cubic\r\nfeet of an argillaceous soil, in three hours; with ten horses it\r\nturned up 19,800 cubic feet of a gravelly soil, in the same time.\r\nThis plough was tried in 1815, against fifteen others of the ordinary\r\nkind, in the construction of a watercourse for a mill; all the\r\nfifteen were quickly broken by the work.\r\n\r\nThe second plough had two handles and a coulter, but the share had\r\nonly one cutting edge, which was rounded and with an ear. It was\r\nmade five times as strong as an ordinary plough, and succeeded well\r\nin compact and argillaceous soils, where, with eight horses and four\r\nmen, it moved 48,000 cubic feet of earth in three hours. In case of\r\nfracture ten minutes sufficed to change the coulter and share, and,\r\nduring the work, 2,300,000 cubic feet of earth were loosened by it.\r\n\r\nThe third plough was smaller and lighter, it had two handles, a\r\ncoulter, an ear, and a share, the latter lance-shaped. It was used\r\nfor excavating the sides of the canal, on which the horses attached\r\nto the first plough found it difficult to walk because of the\r\ninclination. It was worked by ten or twelve men.\r\n\r\nTo establish an accurate comparison between the work of these ploughs\r\nand that done by the pickaxe and spade, a piece of ground was wrought\r\nsolely in the latter manner by six strong working men. The result of\r\na long trial was the breaking of 150 cubic feet of ground by each man\r\nin nine hours. Comparing this result with the work of the ploughs,\r\nthe following are the results:—The first plough did the work of 477\r\nmen, the second of 960 men, and the third that of 50 or 60 men. The\r\ncanal was finished on April 30th, 1825, the ploughs having saved\r\n32,000 days, according to the work-day of a labourer.—_Bull. Univ._\r\nD. vii. 343. [p198]\r\n\r\n4. _Discovery of Rocks under the Surface of the Sea_.—The fishers\r\nof the Mediterranean use an apparatus for the discovery of rocks\r\nbeneath the surface in those places where they wish to cast their\r\nnets, which supplies, in a great measure, the insufficiencies of the\r\nordinary means of taking soundings. The method consists in carrying\r\na long and thin cord over the bottom to be examined, and which, when\r\nit meets with an obstacle, is stopped by it and becomes folded in\r\nthe place where it occurs. It will easily be understood, that when a\r\ncord has been carried over a certain space without meeting with any\r\nresistance, that proof is obtained of the non-existence of rocks or\r\nother obstacles, at a depth less than that to which the cord has been\r\nsunk; and as the examination can easily be carried on to 100 feet\r\nbelow the surface, it may be said that, wherever such an apparatus\r\nhas passed unimpeded, the navigation is free. If, on the contrary,\r\nsome isolated rocks are found during the examination, the place where\r\nthe cord becomes doubled points out the locality, which may then\r\nbe determined more accurately by other trials, and the summit and\r\nneighbourhood of the submersed rocks be accurately examined by means\r\nof soundings.—_Annales Marit._; _Bull. Univ._ F. viii. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Paper to resist Humidity_.—This process, which is due to M.\r\nEngle, consists in plunging unsized paper once or twice into\r\nclear solution of mastic in oil of turpentine, and drying it by a\r\ngentle heat. The paper, without becoming transparent, has all the\r\nproperties of writing-paper, and may be used for the same purposes.\r\nIt is especially recommended for passports, workmen’s books, legal\r\npapers, &c. When preserved for years it is free from injury, either\r\nby humidity, mice, or insects. It is further added, that a solution\r\nof caoutchouc will produce even a still better effect.—_Kunst und\r\nGewerbe-blatte_.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Professor Amici’s Microscopes_.—This distinguished personage has\r\nlately exhibited to the _savans_ of this country two microscopes of\r\nhis own workmanship,—an achromatic refractor, and a reflector of his\r\nown particular invention. The object-glass of his refractor is of a\r\nvery complicated construction, and is composed of three double-object\r\nglasses combined together in the space of about an inch. The\r\nflint-glass from which his concaves are formed is of the manufacture\r\nof Frauenhofer; his convexes are of Dutch plate, crown-glass, and\r\nFrench plate, separately. Each object-glass detached has but a small\r\naperture, and is of long focus; but when the three are combined\r\ntogether, the angle of aperture is very considerable, and the focus\r\nshort. By this ingenious arrangement the trouble and difficulty\r\nof manipulating deep single-object-glasses of large aperture is\r\navoided; but advantages gained one way, in practical optics, are\r\ngenerally lost in another, and the twelve surfaces of the objective\r\nproduce a kind of softness and muddiness in [p199] the image strongly\r\ncontrasted by the effect of a good single triple-glass of equivalent\r\npower. When, however, only two of the object-glasses are combined,\r\nthe effect is very fine. Between the object-glass and eye-glasses is\r\nplaced one of those prisms originally invented by Sir I. Newton to\r\nact as an eye-piece of his telescope, and of which a description may\r\nbe seen in his correspondence at the end of Dr. Gregory’s Optics. The\r\nutility of the introduction of this device appears very questionable\r\nin an instrument already so complicated. The diversion of the rays\r\ninto a course at a right angle to their original progress (merely to\r\ngive an horizontal instead of a vertical position to the body) is\r\nsurely no warrant for the employment of two extra refracting surfaces\r\nand one reflexion, which cannot fail to have a pernicious influence\r\non the formation of the image. An horizontal position of the body\r\nis attained with the utmost facility by a proper construction of\r\nthe mounting, &c. Setting aside the dulness of the image produced\r\nby the numerous refractions, the performance of the instrument on\r\ntest-objects was highly respectable and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe reflector is a modification of the original construction\r\nrecommended by the Professor, who seems to have profited by the\r\nschooling he received from Dr. Goring, and now sails much closer\r\nto the wind than he did. His objective metal is now two inches\r\nfocus, with an aperture of 1-1/2 inch; but half an inch is cut\r\noff for the purpose of preventing the bad effect of the marginal\r\nrays, so that only 1 inch of the central portion of the metal is\r\nemployed;—the diameter of the diagonal mirror is also reduced to its\r\nproper standard, by which means the blot in the centre of the visual\r\npencil is rendered as small as possible. It may be asserted of this\r\ninstrument, that it does as much as can possibly be expected from an\r\nobjective part of 2 inches focus, showing many test-objects faintly,\r\nand with much effort; but it is totally unable to compete with deeper\r\nones equally perfect and of the same angular opening. The Professor\r\nhas, in some of his instruments, reduced the focus of the elliptic\r\nmetal to 1-1/2 inch, and will, no doubt, gradually slide into the\r\nadoption of that radical reform in his instrument, so happily carried\r\ninto effect in this country by Dr. Goring, in conjunction with Mr.\r\nCuthbert,—at least if the figuration of elliptic metals of 3/10\r\ninch focus with 2/10 inch of aperture shall not surpass his powers\r\nof execution. During the Professor’s stay in this country there\r\nwas a grand field-day at his hotel, at which _both his microscopes\r\nwere tried against the Goringian modification of the reflector, the\r\nsuperior weight of metal of which completely beat every thing opposed\r\nto it_. For the honour of the Professor it must be stated, that he\r\nadmitted this defeat with great candour and good sense, and even had\r\nsome difficulty in believing in the identity of some of the objects\r\nused, so differently was the ordinary apparent structure developed\r\nby the English improvements on his instrument. It may with safety\r\nbe averred that no refractor, at least, will ever be [p200] made\r\nto surpass _Dr. Goring’s improved Amician Engiscope_; and it seems\r\nequally certain that no other reflector will ever be invented capable\r\nof the same facilities of application to the examination of both\r\nopaque and transparent objects. If Professor Amici has been beaten,\r\nit has been done with his own weapons,—the copy has surpassed the\r\noriginal,—the child, by virtue of foreign nursing and tuition, has\r\nexceeded the stature and strength of the father.\r\n\r\n\r\n II. CHEMICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _On the Specific Heat of Gases, by_ MM. de la Rive _and_\r\nMarcet.—The principle on which these philosophers proceeded in\r\ntheir researches, was, to expose equal volumes of different gases\r\nto an equal source of heat during equal times, and to judge, by the\r\naugmentation of elastic force in each gas, the temperature which it\r\nhad acquired. The apparatus was a kind of manometer, and consisted\r\nof a glass balloon to retain the gas, and a bent tube attached to\r\nit, which, descending into a vessel of mercury, served to show, by\r\nthe column of metal within it, what was the elasticity of the gas.\r\nThis method was adopted, because, i. The gas was not altered in\r\nvolume by the change of temperature, its elasticity only changing:\r\nii. The temperature was indicated by the gas itself, and not by a\r\nthermometer: iii. Water was easily separated previously from the\r\ngases, and excluded from the apparatus: iv. All the gases were placed\r\nin exactly the same circumstances, so as to render it unnecessary to\r\nrefer to any calculation for the purpose of comparison.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of applying heat were resorted to: in one the balloon,\r\ncontaining the gas at a certain temperature, was placed in water at\r\na higher but constant degree, for a certain time (generally 4′),\r\nand the elevation of temperature noticed: in the other, the balloon\r\nwith the gas was inclosed in a larger copper balloon, blackened\r\ninside, and the space between the two exhausted as much as possible\r\nof air; the apparatus being then immersed in warm water, the heat\r\ngained access slowly to the gas, and the time of each experiment\r\nwas increased, at the same time that certain sources of error were\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThe gases experimented with were, atmospheric air, oxygen, azote,\r\nhydrogen, carbonic acid, olefiant gas, oxide of carbon, nitrous\r\noxide, nitrous gas, sulphuretted hydrogen, ammonia, sulphurous\r\nacid, muriatic acid, and cyanogen. Great care was taken in their\r\npreparation. The result of the experiment was very unexpected; for,\r\nduring the five minutes allotted for each, all had acquired the same\r\ntemperature,—a circumstance which proves that they all have the\r\n_same specific heat_. The equal volumes of gas at the pressure of\r\n65 centimeters (15.59 inches) and the temperature of 20°C., being\r\nexposed to a source of heat at 30° C., acquired a mean temperature\r\nof 6.32 degrees in five minutes, the extreme difference, in any of\r\nthe experiments, not being more than 0.04 of a [p201] degree. One gas\r\nonly forms an exception to the above statement, namely, hydrogen,\r\nwhich was always heated more than the others, namely, to 6.6 degrees\r\nin the five minutes. This effect is considered as due not to any\r\ndifference in specific heat, but to a difference in conducting power.\r\n\r\nExperiments were then made with dilated gases, to ascertain whether\r\ndilatation caused any change in capacity, and it was found to\r\ndiminish slowly but regularly with the diminution of pressure. These\r\nresults, with a third which is also interesting, have been thus\r\ngenerally expressed by the authors at the end of their memoir.\r\n\r\ni. All gases in equal volumes, and at the same pressure, have the\r\nsame specific heat.\r\n\r\nii. Other circumstances being the same, the specific heat of gases\r\ndiminishes with diminution of pressure, and equally for all the\r\ngases: the progression converges slightly and in a ratio much less\r\nthan that of the pressures.\r\n\r\niii. Each gas has a different conducting power, _i.e._, all the gases\r\nhave not the some power of communicating or receiving heat.—_Ann. de\r\nChimie_, xxxv. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _On the Incandescence and Light of Lime_.—The experiments made\r\nby Lieutenant Drummond upon the light of lime and other earths when\r\nhighly ignited, with the highly interesting application which he has\r\nmade of that emitted from lime, to the purpose of geodesical surveys,\r\nhas induced M. Pleischel to repeat and vary the results. He states\r\nthat the utmost light is given by lime; the earth being pulverised\r\nand exposed on burning charcoal to the heat excited by a jet of\r\noxygen falling upon it. He endeavours to account for the effect, by\r\nsupposing a kind of pulverulent atmosphere disengaged from the lime\r\nat the high temperature used, and considers that the substances which\r\nare competent to emit molecules only in the gaseous state, cannot\r\nproduce this intense light.—_Zeitschrift für Physik_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Evolution of Heat during the Compression of Water_. May 14,\r\n1827.—M. Arago announced to the Academy of Sciences, that M. Despretz\r\nhad ascertained experimentally, that the compression of water by\r\na force equal to 20 atmospheres, caused the disengagement of one\r\nsixty-sixth part of a degree of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _On Electrical Excitation_.—M. Walcker affirms positively from\r\nexperiments made with great care, that three bodies of different\r\nexciting power are necessary, in every case of excitation of\r\nelectricity by contact, and that all the phenomena of this kind are\r\nsubject to this condition. If, for instance, two portions of the same\r\nmetal being put in contact, electricity is produced, it is because\r\nthere are three different states of temperature brought into play,\r\none being the result of the other two, and a mean between them. One\r\nfact which more than any other sanctioned this idea, was, that the\r\nelectric [p202] currents were the more apparent as this third state\r\nof temperature was made more sensible.—_Bull. Univ._, A. vii. 374.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Magnetic Repulsion_.—A very remarkable result has been obtained\r\nby M. Becquerel, from the use of an extremely delicate magnetic\r\narrangement, which he has for the present called a _sideroscope_. Its\r\nuse is exactly the same in principle as that of the magnetic needle,\r\nindicating iron, for instance, by the attraction manifested; but\r\nit is so delicate that it will show it in the most minute quantity\r\npossible, as, for instance, in gold, silver, or copper money,\r\ninnumerable minerals, &c. This instrument shows no magnetic power or\r\nattraction in gold, silver, copper, palladium, tin, lead, zinc, or\r\nbrass, when chemically pure, and a great many vegetable and mineral\r\nsubstances have no action on it: but the most curious result is, that\r\nvery pure bismuth and even that of commerce has a _repulsive_ power,\r\nwhich, if it be found ultimately to be independent of any magnetic\r\n_polarity_, is the first fact of the kind that has been made known.\r\nAntimony also presents the same phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Diminished Solubility of Substances by Heat_.—Mr. Graham\r\nhas added one to the few facts of this kind with which we were\r\nacquainted, and has accompanied its description with some very\r\ninteresting considerations, which may be found at length in the\r\nPhilosophical Magazine, N. S., ii. 20. The salt experimented with by\r\nMr. Graham is the phosphate of magnesia; which may be prepared by\r\nmixing a solution of 21 parts of phosphate of soda with one of 15.375\r\nparts of sulphate of magnesia: within 24 hours the phosphate of\r\nmagnesia precipitates in acicular crystals; they should be agitated\r\nwith repeated portions of water, then thrown upon a filter with more\r\nwater, and left to dry.\r\n\r\nSolutions were obtained by occasionally agitating this salt with\r\nwater in the proportion of 2 ounces to a pint of the fluid, for\r\nfour days; being then decanted and filtered, they had a sweetish\r\ntaste. A quantity of this fluid being heated in a water-bath, became\r\nturbid before the temperature had attained 120° F.; at 212° a cloudy\r\nprecipitate slowly subsided, and the supernatant fluid became nearly\r\ntransparent. The precipitate was found to be anhydrous phosphate of\r\nmagnesia; and, by further experiment, the difference in solubility\r\nwas found to be such, that water at 45°, dissolving 1/744th part its\r\nweight of the anhydrous salt, water at 212° only dissolved 1/1151th\r\npart. When in the state of crystals, or as hydrate, the proportions\r\nof salt were 1/322 and 1/498 to 1 of water.\r\n\r\nMere continuance of the heat had no effect in increasing the\r\nprecipitate either of this salt, or from aqueous solution of lime,\r\nprovided no part of the solution was at any time converted into\r\nvapour; but if the solution only occupied a small part of the vessel,\r\nand ebullition came on, then, although all the water might be\r\nreturned to the solution, yet the precipitation went on, and might\r\nbe [p203] increased _ad libitum_, particularly in the case of lime\r\nwater. The cause of the precipitate appears to be the same in all\r\nthese cases. The moment a drop of the solution is converted into\r\nvapour, it deposits the quantity of lime or salt which it held in\r\nsolution; and in the case of bodies which dissolve so sparingly and\r\nwith so much difficulty, although the water be returned again to the\r\nsolution, it is incapable of re-dissolving what it has deposited. We\r\nknow that it would be a hopeless task to form a saturated solution of\r\nlime by agitating with the water no more than the few grains which\r\nit is capable of dissolving; and in the case of ebullition, when the\r\nlime is once deposited, there should be the same difficulty in taking\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nMr. Graham states that he has observed this effect not only in\r\nlime-water and in solution of phosphate of magnesia, but to a certain\r\nextent in all bodies of difficult solubility, in the sulphate of\r\nlime, for instance, even when greatly diluted; and he believes that\r\nthe deposite from slight boiling observed in many mineral waters,\r\nand generally attributed to the dissipation of carbonic acid gas,\r\ndepends, in some instances, upon this cause. However weak the\r\nsolution may be, it is evident that a portion of the salt may be\r\ndeposited in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _On the Composition of Cyanic Acid_.—M. Wohler some time since\r\nannounced the production of cyanic acid, and cyanates, corresponding\r\nin composition to the substance presumed to exist in the fulminating\r\ncompounds of silver, mercury, &c., the nature of which was made out\r\nby MM. Liebig and Gay Lussac. M. Liebig, upon repeating M. Wohler’s\r\nexperiments upon his cyanate of silver, obtained only 71.012 per\r\ncent. of oxide of silver, instead of 77.23, which was the quantity\r\npresent according to M. Wohler’s analysis, and concluded that the\r\nacid was the cyanous, and not the cyanic. The latter philosopher was\r\nconsequently induced to repeat his experiments: one of his methods\r\nof decomposing the cyanate of silver was by muriatic acid gas: at\r\nfirst liquid cyanic acid forms, which is very soon transformed into\r\na white crystalline mass; but, on continuing the operation, and\r\napplying a higher heat, a large quantity of muriate of ammonia and\r\ncyanic acid is evolved. This process indicated 77.5 per cent. of\r\noxide of silver in the salt. Another process consisted in dissolving\r\nthe cyanate in nitric acid, and precipitating the silver by muriatic\r\nacid, the result was 77.05 of oxide per cent. A third analysis, made\r\nby reducing the silver of the salt, gave a result of 77.35 per cent.\r\noxide. The mean of these is 77.3, and the theoretical number obtained\r\nby calculation is 77.23, so that the acid appears to be truly the\r\ncyanic; and the curious fact of its being the same in composition\r\nwith that in the fulminating compounds of silver and mercury, but\r\nvery unlike in properties, still remains undisturbed.—_Bull. Univ._,\r\nA. viii. 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Iodous Acid_.—According to M. Wohler, the iodous acid of [p204]\r\nM. Sementini[35] is nothing more than a mixture of chloride of iodine\r\nand iodine. When saturated with carbonate of soda, the iodine in\r\nsolution is precipitated, and on evaporating the solution to dryness,\r\nand heating it strongly, the residue fuses, and by proper tests is\r\nfound to be a mixture of chloride and iodide of sodium.\r\n\r\nThese statements apply only to the iodous acid: as to the oxide of\r\niodine, no source of chlorine exists in the process last described by\r\nM. Sementini.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [35] See the last volume of this Journal, p. 477.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _On Manganesic Acid, by_ M. Unverdorben.—When manganesate\r\nof potash is distilled with a little anhydrous sulphuric acid,\r\nmanganesic acid is evolved in the form of a red transparent gas,\r\nwhich dissolves in water, forming a red solution. The gas frequently\r\ndecomposes spontaneously in the retort, with explosion, producing\r\noxide of manganese and oxygen.\r\n\r\nManganesate of potash was analysed by distilling it with excess of\r\nsulphuric acid, collecting the oxygen disengaged, and estimating the\r\nproportion of protoxide of manganese and salts of potash remaining in\r\nthe retort. According to these experiments the acid consists of\r\n\r\n Manganese   58.74\r\n Oxygen      41.26\r\n            ------\r\n            100.00\r\n\r\n And the manganesate of potash of     Or being calcined\r\n     Potash              25.63            32.75\r\n     Manganese acid      52.44            67.25\r\n     Water               21.93           ------\r\n                        ------           100.00\r\n                        100.00\r\n                        _Ann. des Mines_, 1827, p. 145.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Heavy Muriatic Ether, and Hydrocarburet of Chlorine or Chloric\r\nEther_.—Some comparative experiments have been made on these two\r\nsubstances by M. Vogel. He prepared the former of them by passing\r\nchlorine gas into alcohol. The muriatic acid was then separated by\r\ndistilling the fluid from off chalk, in which operation the muriatic\r\nether and alcohol passed over together, and these were divided by the\r\naddition of water, which dissolved the latter, and left the former.\r\nThe chloric ether was made as usual from chlorine and olefiant\r\ngases. The results that were obtained by acting on these substances\r\nby a high temperature, potash, phosphorus, &c., induced M. Vogel\r\nto consider them as identical in composition, notwithstanding some\r\ndifferences in their physical properties; the specific gravity of the\r\nmuriatic ether was 1.134, that of the chloric ether 1.214, and the\r\nodour of the latter is more aromatic, and the taste more sweet than\r\nof the former.\r\n\r\nWhilst passing the chlorine into the alcohol, M. Vogel observed\r\n[p205] that if the sun shone upon the substances when the action was\r\nnearly complete, each bubble of chlorine as it entered the alcohol\r\nproduced a bright purple flame, a dense white vapour, and caused\r\nviolent concussions in the liquid; another curious instance, in\r\naddition to the many that are known, of the power of solar light over\r\nchemical action.—_Journ. de Pharm._ 1826, p. 627.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _Test for the Presence of Nitric Acid_.—The following method is\r\none devised by Dr. Liebig, for the detection of this substance, which\r\nit will effect, he says, when there is not more than a four-hundredth\r\npart of the acid present. The liquid to be examined must be mixed\r\nwith sufficient sulphuric solution of indigo to acquire a distinct\r\nblue colour, a few drops of sulphuric acid added, and the whole\r\nboiled. If the liquid contains a nitrate, it will be bleached, or,\r\nif the quantity is very small, rendered yellow. By adding a little\r\nmuriate of soda to the liquid before applying heat, a five-hundredth\r\nof nitric acid may easily be discovered.—_Ann. de Chimie_, xxxv. 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Peculiar Formation of Nitre_.—The leaves and stems of beet root\r\ncontain oxalate and malate of potash. Some leaves were tied together\r\nand hung up in a warm and slightly-humid place, where there was but\r\nlittle light, to dry. Being examined at the end of several months,\r\nthey were found penetrated with, and covered by, an immense number\r\nof minute crystals of nitre. The oxalic and malic acids had been\r\nreplaced by nitric acid; but whether from animalized matter naturally\r\nin the leaves of the plant, or from the action of the air, or in what\r\nmanner, is not known.—M. HENRI BRACONNOT, _Ann. de Chimie_, xxxv. 260.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Experiments on Fluoric Acid and Fluates, by_ M. Kuhlman.—These\r\nexperiments were made with dry sulphuric acid and fluor spar, with\r\nthe intention of proving that fluor spar is truly a compound of\r\nfluorine and calcium, and not of fluoric acid and oxide of calcium.\r\nA quantity of anhydrous sulphuric acid was prepared with great care,\r\nand collected in a glass tube; the latter was then connected with\r\na platina tube charged with fluor spar, which had previously been\r\ncalcined in a platina crucible, and a glass tube was connected with\r\nthe other end of the platina tube for the purpose of conducting and\r\nfacilitating the collection of the gas evolved over mercury. The\r\nfluor spar was heated to redness, and then the temperature of the\r\nsulphuric acid raised so as to cause a stream of it in vapour to\r\npass over the fluor spar; but there was not the slightest reaction,\r\nthe sulphuric acid recondensed in part in the farthest tube, and no\r\ntrace of fluoric acid was produced. Dry sulphuric acid was then put,\r\nin the liquid state, in contact with dry fluor spar, but there was\r\nno decomposition, and no portion of the spar was converted [p206]\r\ninto sulphate of lime. The first experiment was then repeated, with\r\nthe difference of using hydrated sulphuric acid of specific gravity\r\n1.842, and there was instantly much fluoric acid produced, which\r\nacted upon the glass.\r\n\r\nAs Berzelius found 100 parts of fluor spar, when acted upon by\r\nsulphuric acid, to yield 175 parts of sulphate of lime, equal to\r\n73.553 parts of lime, or 52.819 of calcium, it follows that 100\r\nparts of fluoride of calcium should contain 47.181 of fluorine and\r\n52.819 of calcium. By the assistance of this result, and further\r\nexperiments, M. Kuhlman proceeded to ascertain the composition of\r\nhydro-fluoric acid. Dry muriatic acid gas was passed over calcined\r\nfluor spar heated to redness in a tube of platina; the fluoride of\r\ncalcium was decomposed, free hydro-fluoric acid was evolved, and\r\nchloride of lime remained in the tube. The hydro-fluoric acid acted\r\nupon the glass tubes, but being received in water was entirely\r\ndissolved, with the exception of the silica it had separated from\r\nthe glass: no trace of hydrogen appeared. One hundred parts of\r\nfluoride of calcium thus treated became 143.417 parts of chloride of\r\ncalcium, the 52.819 parts of calcium having united to 90.598 parts of\r\nchlorine. But this latter quantity must have liberated 2.511 parts of\r\nhydrogen, which must, therefore, have combined with the 47.181 parts\r\nof fluorine in the spar, to form 49.692 parts of hydro-fluoric acid.\r\nThis latter body, therefore, consists of 94.941 fluorine, and 5.059\r\nof hydrogen per cent. A small quantity of chlorine was set at liberty\r\nduring the experiment, the author thinks, from a little manganese in\r\nthe fluor spar.\r\n\r\nM. Kuhlman found that all the chlorides, when subjected to the action\r\nof anhydrous sulphuric acid in vapour, resisted decomposition, except\r\nthe chloride of sodium, which gave a small quantity of sulphate of\r\nsoda, and a double salt of soda and platina, crystallizing in fine\r\nneedles of a yellow colour. No doubt is entertained that, in the\r\nlatter case, the common salt and sulphuric acid were not perfectly\r\ndry.—_Bull. Univ._\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _Crystallization of Phosphorous_.—By the fusion and careful\r\nrefrigeration of a large quantity of phosphorus, M. Frantween has\r\nobtained very fine crystals of an octoedral form, and as large in\r\nsize as a cherry-stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _Solutions of Phosphorus in Oils_.—The solutions of phosphorus\r\nin fixed oils are so luminous as often to be resorted to for the\r\nexhibition of this peculiar property of phosphorus; but M. Walcker\r\nhas remarked, that the power which they ordinarily possess is\r\ninstantaneously destroyed by the addition of small quantities only of\r\ncertain other substances, as the essential oils. The rectified oils\r\nof turpentine and amber, the oils of rosemary, bergamotte, lemon,\r\ncamomile, angelica root, juniper berries, and parsley seed, [p207]\r\nthe oil obtained by the distillation of the nutmeg, all produce this\r\neffect when their quantity is not more than one-fiftieth part of the\r\nluminous oily solution of phosphorus. The same effect is produced by\r\nadding about a fifth of the oils of anniseed, cajeput, lavender, rue,\r\nsassafras, fern, cascarilla, mint, orange flowers, fennel, valerian,\r\ncherry laurel, or bitter almonds, or balsam of copaiba; but the oil\r\nof cinnamon, rectified petroleum, balsam of Peru, and camphor, have\r\nno such effect.—_Annal. der Phys._ 1826, p. 125.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. _On the Inflammation of Powder when struck by Brass, &c._—Iron\r\nhas been excluded from powder-works as subject to cause sparks by a\r\nblow, and brass and copper have been recommended in its place. M. le\r\nCol. Aubert has remarked, that brass on brass can inflame powder, and\r\nhas made experiments on the subject before a committee, the result of\r\nwhich is as follows:—Inflammation of the powder takes place when the\r\nblow is given by iron against iron; iron against brass; brass against\r\nbrass; iron against marble; lead against lead, or against wood,\r\nwhen the blow is produced by a leaden ball shot from a fire-arm. As\r\nyet the powder has not been inflamed by the blow of an iron hammer\r\nagainst lead or wood.—_Bull. de la Soc. d’Encouragement;_ _Bull.\r\nUniv._\r\n\r\n\r\n17. _Cementation of Iron by Cast Iron_.—Pure iron, when surrounded\r\nby, and in contact with, cast iron turnings, and heated, is\r\ncarbonised very rapidly, so as to harden, to temper, and, in fact,\r\nto exhibit all the properties of steel. M. Gautier finds this a very\r\nadvantageous process in numerous cases, especially where the articles\r\nto be case-hardened, or converted into steel, are small, as iron\r\nwire, or wire gauze. The temperature required is not so high as that\r\nnecessary in the ordinary process of cementation, and the pieces to\r\nbe carbonised are not injured in form. The kind of cast iron used\r\nshould be the gray metal, and the more minutely it is divided the\r\nmore rapid and complete is the operation. By covering the mass of\r\ncast metal, in which the iron to be carbonised is enveloped, with\r\nsand, oxidation, from contact of the air, is prevented, and the cast\r\nmetal may be used many times. Plumbago experimented with in the same\r\nmanner does not produce the effect.—_Jour. de Pharmacie_, 1827, p. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. _On the Preparation of Ferro-prussiate of Potash, by_ M.\r\nGautier.—Numerous investigations induced M. Gautier to conclude,\r\nthat, i. When animal matter is calcined alone it yields but little\r\ncyanogen. ii. That when mixed with potash it gives more, but the\r\ncyanuret is not ferruretted. iii. That ammonia is then produced in\r\nlarge quantity. iv. That the substitution of nitre for potash, and\r\nthe addition of iron or scales of iron, augmented the production of\r\ncyanogen, and gave a ferro-prussiate. The following is the process\r\nof manufacture to which M. Gautier has ultimately arrived, [p208]\r\nand which he has practised for some years. The proportions of the\r\nmaterials are—\r\n\r\n Blood, considered as in the dry state,  3 parts\r\n Nitre                                   1 part\r\n Iron scales                             1/50 of the blood employed.\r\n\r\nThe blood is first to be coagulated in a large copper cauldron, and\r\nthe serum being separated by means of a press, the coagulum is to be\r\nreturned to the cauldron with the nitre and iron. The quantity of\r\nwater contained in the blood is sufficient to liquify the salt, so as\r\nto allow of an uniform mixture being effected. The mixture is then\r\nremoved, and exposed in an airy situation to dry, the putrefaction\r\nof the blood being prevented by the nitre. When the desiccation is\r\ncomplete, the mixture is charged into cast iron cylinders, which are\r\nfixed in a reverberatory furnace, and in all things resemble those\r\nused in the preparation of animal charcoal. These are to be raised to\r\na brown red heat, until no more vapour is disengaged, and then left\r\nuntil nearly cold, after which the contents are to be withdrawn and\r\nput into a wooden vat, with twelve or fifteen times their weight of\r\nwater, for an hour. The fluid is then to be filtered through a cloth,\r\nand evaporated until of 32° of Beaué (specific gravity 1.284.) Being\r\nthen left to cool, a large quantity of well-crystallized bi-carbonate\r\nof potash is obtained. M. Gautier says he has not, as yet, been\r\nable to explain how it is that this bi-carbonate has been formed\r\nat so high a temperature; a portion also appears to be decomposed\r\nduring the evaporation of the solution, which, at first but slightly\r\nalkaline, becomes sensibly so by a prolonged evaporation.\r\n\r\nAs the same product is not obtained when potash is used in place of\r\nnitre, it is probable that the elements of the nitric acid perform a\r\nparticular part in the operation.\r\n\r\nThe solution which has given the crystals of carbonate of potash\r\ncontains a little carbonate of potash, and much ferro-prussiate of\r\npotash. It is to be concentrated to 34° (specific gravity 1.306), and\r\nplaced in wooden vessels lined with lead. In the course of some days\r\na greenish crystalline mass is obtained, which being redissolved in a\r\nfresh quantity of pure water, and evaporated to 32° or 33° (specific\r\ngravity 1.295), is to be recrystallized.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when using potash, M. Gautier has mixed nitre with it, and\r\nhas always obtained a richer product than when potash alone had been\r\nemployed.—_Jour. de Phar._ 1827, p. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. _Sulphocyanide of Potassium in Saliva_.—MM. Tiedemann and Gmelin\r\nhave observed the existence of this peculiar compound in saliva, in\r\ntwo cases; the one when the fluid was secreted during smoking, and\r\nthe other when no such stimulus was applied.—_Ann. de Chimie_, xxxv.\r\n266.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. _Decomposition of Sulphate of Copper by Tartaric Acid_.—M. [p209]\r\nPlanche has observed, that when sulphate of copper is dissolved in\r\nwine vinegar, for the purpose of preparing a corrosive liquid to be\r\napplied to corns on the feet, that the tartaric acid present in the\r\nvinegar displaces the sulphuric acid from a part of the salt, and an\r\ninsoluble acid tartrate of copper is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. _Separation of Arsenic from Nickel or Cobalt_.—The following\r\nprocess by M. Woehler seems among the best of those intended for\r\nfreeing nickel or cobalt from arsenic in the dry way. It is founded\r\nupon the circumstances that many alloys, when heated with sulphuret\r\nof potash, become changed into a mixture of sulphurets, and that\r\nsulphuret of arsenic is very soluble in sulphuret of potash. One\r\npart of kupfernickle, fused and reduced to fine powder, is to be\r\nmixed with 3 parts of carbonate of potash, and 3 parts of sulphur,\r\nin a covered Hessian crucible. The heat is to be gradually raised to\r\nredness, and until the mass is just entering into fusion, and by no\r\nmeans so highly as to fuse the sulphuret of nickel which is formed.\r\nWhen cold, water is to be added, which will dissolve the sulphuret\r\nof potash, and leave a yellow crystalline powder, which is sulphuret\r\nof nickel, retaining, perhaps, a little copper or cobalt, but no\r\narsenic, if the operation has been well performed. When, however, the\r\nobject is to have the nickel perfectly pure, it should be fused a\r\nsecond time with sulphur and potash.\r\n\r\nThe method of freeing cobalt from arsenic, is the same as for\r\nnickel; but it is then necessary to perform the operation a second\r\ntime. The cobalt (that of Tunaberg) has never been perfectly freed\r\nfrom arsenic by one operation, but has never retained any after the\r\nsecond.—_Archiv für Bergbau_, 1826, p. 186.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. _Compounds of Gold_.—According to late experiments of Dr.\r\nThomson, peroxide of gold consists of\r\n\r\n 1 atom gold    25\r\n 3  \"  oxygen    3\r\n               ---\r\n                28\r\n\r\nand is consequently a teroxide.

A mirror, which was found to consist of 85 parts of copper, 14\r\nof tin, and 1 of iron per cent.; iii. A blue colour found in a tomb:\r\n[p210] it was composed of silica 70 parts; lime 9; oxide of copper\r\n15; oxide of iron 1; soda mixed with potash 4. A blue identical with\r\nthis, both in colour and composition, was found in the bottom of a\r\nfurnace in which copper had been fused at Romilly.\r\n\r\nM. D’Arcet has examined a bone from the fore part of an ox, which had\r\nbeen placed as an offering to the divinity in an Egyptian tomb, and\r\nfound that it contained as much gelatine as recent bone, although\r\nrather less is obtained by muriatic acid, (20 per cent. instead of\r\n27) because of a deterioration of the bone. When burnt, it gave an\r\nanimal black as deep in colour as that from recent bone.\r\n\r\nM. Le Baillif has examined some grains of corn, which were so well\r\npreserved, that when put into boiling water iodine produced the\r\nblue colour dependent upon starch. He also made some experiments on\r\na gummy substance, and on two cords from a musical instrument; the\r\nlatter were of animal substance.\r\n\r\nM. Raspail examined some grain which was supposed to be wheat, but\r\nfound it to be torrified barley; it was covered with a substance\r\ncommunicated probably by the oil and incense with which the grains\r\nwere bathed when consecrated. Similar grains were obtained by\r\nroasting common barley.\r\n\r\nThe account of most of these researches is given in the Catalogue\r\nraisonné et historique des Antiquités découvertes en Egypte, by M.\r\nPassalacqua.—_Bull. Univ._ A. vii. 264.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. _On the Bitter Substance produced by the action of Nitric Acid on\r\nIndigo, Silk, and Aloes_, _by_ M. Just Liebeg.—The process by which\r\nM. Liebeg obtains a pure and uniform substance from the action of\r\nnitric acid on indigo, is as follows:—A portion of the best indigo\r\nis to be broken into small fragments, and moderately heated with\r\neight or ten times its weight of nitric acid of moderate strength.\r\nIt will dissolve, evolving an abundance of nitrous vapours and\r\nswelling up in the vessel. After the scum has fallen, the liquid is\r\nto be boiled, and nitric acid added, whilst any disengagement of red\r\nvapours is occasioned by it. When the liquid has become cold, a large\r\nquantity of semi-transparent yellow crystals will be formed, and if\r\nthe operation has been well conducted, no artificial tannin or resin\r\nwill be obtained. The crystals are to be washed with cold water, and\r\nthen boiled in water sufficient to dissolve them. If any oily drops\r\nof tannin form on the surface of the solution, they must be carefully\r\nremoved by touching them with filtering paper. Then filtering the\r\nfluid, and allowing it to cool, yellow brilliant crystalline plates\r\nwill be obtained, which will not lose their lustre by washing.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the substance perfectly pure, the crystals must be\r\nre-dissolved in boiling water, and neutralized by carbonate of\r\npotash. Upon cooling, a salt of potash will crystallize, which should\r\nbe purified by repeated crystallizations.\r\n\r\nOn mixing the first mother liquor with water, a considerable brown\r\nprecipitate will be obtained, which being dissolved in boiling\r\n[p211] water, and neutralized by carbonate of potash, will furnish\r\na large quantity of the potash salt. All the potash salt obtained\r\nin these operations is to be re-dissolved in boiling water, and\r\nnitric, muriatic, or sulphuric acid added; as the solution cools, the\r\npeculiar substance will be observed to form very brilliant plates of\r\na clear yellow colour, generally in equilateral triangular forms.\r\n\r\nSometimes crystals are not formed after the action of the nitric acid\r\non the indigo, in which case the liquor must be evaporated, and water\r\nadded, when the substance will precipitate, and must be purified\r\nas already described. Four parts of indigo yield one of the pure\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nWhen the substance is heated, it fuses, and is volatilized without\r\ndecomposition; when subjected to a sudden strong heat, it inflames\r\nwithout explosion, its vapours burning with a yellow flame, and a\r\ncarbonaceous residue remaining. It is but little soluble in cold\r\nwater, but much more in boiling water; the solution has a bright\r\nyellow colour, reddens litmus, has an extremely bitter taste, and\r\nacts like a strong acid on metallic oxides, dissolving them, and\r\nforming peculiar crystallizable salts.—Ether and alcohol dissolve the\r\nsubstance readily.\r\n\r\nWhen fused in chlorine or with iodine, it is not decomposed, nor does\r\nsolution of chlorine affect it. Cold sulphuric acid has no action\r\non it; when hot, it dissolves it, but water separates the substance\r\nwithout alteration. Boiling muriatic acid does not affect it, and\r\nnitro-muriatic acid only with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nThese results show that no nitric acid is present in the substance,\r\nand other experiments prove that no oxide of nitrogen exists in it;\r\nit contains no oxalic or other organic acid, for when its salt is\r\nboiled with chloride of gold, the latter is not reduced.\r\n\r\nWhen heated to redness with oxide of copper, it gave a mixture of\r\nnitrogen and carbonic acid, in the exact proportion of 1 volume of\r\nthe former, to 5 of the latter. This was a constant result, and in no\r\ncase was any sulphuric or muriatic acid left in the copper. 0.0625\r\ngrammes of the substance thus decomposed, gave 45 cubic centimeters\r\nof the mixed gases, estimated at 0° C. (32° F.) and the pressure of\r\n28 inches of mercury, according to which the acid would be composed\r\nof carbon 32.392; nitrogen 15.2144; oxygen 52.3936 per cent. From the\r\nmean of several experiments, it appeared that the following might\r\nrepresent the composition correctly.—\r\n\r\n 12-1/2 atoms of carbon     93.75  or  31.5128\r\n  2-1/2   \"      azote      43.75  \"   14.7060\r\n 16       \"      oxygen    160.00  \"   53.7812\r\n                          -------     --------\r\n                           297.5      100.\r\n\r\n100 parts of the acid neutralize a quantity of base equivalent to\r\n3.26 of oxygen, which is to the oxygen of the acid, as 1:16; the\r\nequivalent number of the acid derived from the analysis of the [p212]\r\nbarytic salt was 306.3; by adding only 1/4 per cent. to the quantity\r\nof baryta obtained in the experiment, 297.5, or the number expressed\r\nby the above formula, would be obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen a salt of potash or baryta was decomposed by oxide of copper and\r\nheat, the quantity of carbonic acid produced was a little short of\r\nfive times the quantity of nitrogen; but, upon adding that retained\r\nby the alkali or earth, the proportion became exactly the same as in\r\nthe former cases.\r\n\r\n_Welter’s bitter principle_ was prepared by acting on silk with ten\r\nor twelve times its weight of nitric acid. The liquid, slightly\r\ncoloured at first, acquired a deep yellow upon adding water. It was\r\nneutralized by carbonate of potash whilst hot, and left to cool, and\r\nthe salt of potash thus obtained, decomposed by muriatic, nitric, or\r\nsulphuric acid. This acid, crystallized like that from indigo, formed\r\nthe same salts, and was composed in the same manner. Silk furnishes\r\nmuch less of the substance than indigo. Dr. Liebeg has called this\r\nsubstance _carbazotic acid_. The most important salts formed by it\r\nhave the following properties:—\r\n\r\n_Carbazotate of Potash_—crystallizes in long yellow quadrilateral\r\nneedles, semi-transparent and very brilliant; it dissolves in\r\n260 parts of water at 59° F., and in much less, boiling water: a\r\nsaturated boiling solution becomes a yellow mass of needles, from\r\nwhich scarcely any fluid will run. Strong acids decompose it;\r\nyet when an alcoholic solution of carbazotic acid is added to a\r\nsolution of nitre, crystallized carbazotate of potash, after some\r\ntime, precipitates.—Alcohol does not dissolve it. When a little\r\nis gradually heated in a glass tube, it first fuses, and then\r\nsuddenly explodes, breaking the tube to atoms; traces of charcoal\r\nare observed on the fragments. This salt precipitates a solution\r\nof the protonitrate of mercury, but not salts, containing the\r\nperoxide, or those of copper, lead, cobalt, iron, lime, baryta,\r\nstrontia, or magnesia. The slight solubility of this salt supplies\r\nan easy method of testing and separating potash in a fluid. Even\r\nthe potash in tincture of litmus may be discovered by it; for, on\r\nadding a few drops of carbazotic acid, dissolved in alcohol, to\r\ninfusion of litmus, crystals of the salt gradually separated. The\r\nsaturated solution of the salt at 50° F., is not troubled by muriate\r\nof platina. The salt contains no water of crystallization. It was\r\nanalyzed by converting a portion of it into chloride of potassium by\r\nmuriatic acid: its composition is,—\r\n\r\n Carbazotic acid   83.79\r\n Potash            16.21\r\n                  ------\r\n                  100.00\r\n\r\n_Carbazotate of Soda_—crystallizes in fine silky yellow needles,\r\nhaving the general properties of the salt of potash, but soluble in\r\nfrom 20 to 24 parts of water, at 59° F.\r\n\r\n_Carbazotate of Ammonia_ forms very long, flattened, brilliant,\r\n[p213] yellow crystals, very soluble in water. Heated carefully in\r\na glass tube, it fuses, and is volatilized without decomposition;\r\nheated suddenly, it inflames without explosion, and leaves much\r\ncarbonaceous residue.\r\n\r\n_Carbazotate of Baryta_, obtained by heating carbonate of baryta, and\r\ncarbazotic acid with water. It crystallizes in quadrangular prisms of\r\na deep colour, and dissolves easily in water. When heated, it fuses,\r\nand is decomposed with very powerful explosion, producing a vivid\r\nyellow flame. The explosion is as powerful as that of fulminating\r\nsilver; a solution of chloride of potassium to which carbazotate of\r\nbaryta has been added, produces a precipitate of the potash salt,\r\nand not more than 1-1/2 per cent. of potash remains in solution. 100\r\nparts of the crystallized salt contain,—\r\n\r\n Carbazotic acid   69.16   oxygen of the acid   16\r\n Baryta            21.60           \"    earth    1\r\n Water              9.24           \"    water    8\r\n                 -------\r\n                  100.00\r\n\r\n_Carbazotate of Lime_, obtained like the salt of baryta, forms\r\nflattened quadrangular prisms, very soluble in water, and detonating\r\nlike the salt of potash.\r\n\r\n_Carbazotate of Magnesia_ forms very long indistinct needles, of a\r\nclear yellow colour; is very soluble, and detonates violently.\r\n\r\n_Carbazotate of Copper_, prepared by decomposing sulphate of\r\ncopper by carbazotate of baryta: it crystallizes with difficulty,\r\nthe crystals being of a fine green colour; it is deliquescent;\r\nwhen heated, it is decomposed without explosion, and even without\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n_Carbazotate of Silver_.—Carbazotic acid readily dissolves oxide of\r\nsilver, when heated with it and water; and the solution, gradually\r\nevaporated, yields starry groups of fine acicular crystals of the\r\ncolour and lustre of gold; the salt dissolves readily in water; when\r\nheated to a certain degree, it does not detonate, but fuses like\r\ngunpowder.\r\n\r\n_Proto-Carbazotate of Mercury_, obtained in small yellow triangular\r\ncrystals, by mixing boiling solutions of the carbazotate of potash or\r\nsoda, and proto-nitrate of mercury. It requires more than 1200 parts\r\nof water for its solution: for its perfect purification, it should\r\nbe heated with a solution of chloride of potassium, the insoluble\r\nportion separated whilst the liquid is lost, and the peculiar salt\r\nallowed to deposit as the temperature falls. When heated, it behaves\r\nlike the salt of silver.\r\n\r\nAll these salts detonate much more powerfully when heated in close\r\nvessels, than when heated in the air; and it was a curious thing to\r\nobserve, that those with bases yielding oxygen most readily, were\r\nthose which exploded with least force. By heating some of the salts\r\npreviously mixed with chloride of potassium, &c., to retard the\r\naction, it appeared that no carbonic oxide, but only carbonic [p214]\r\nacid and azote were evolved during their decomposition by heat.\r\n\r\n_On the Bitter Principle from Aloes_.—Upon distilling 8 parts\r\nof nitric acid from 1 part of the extract of aloes, and adding\r\nwater to the remaining fluid, a resinous reddish yellow substance\r\nprecipitated, which, by washing, became pulverulent—it was\r\ndiscovered by M. Braconnot. Upon evaporating the liquid separated\r\nfrom the precipitate, it gave large yellow rhomboidal crystals,\r\nnot transparent, and but slightly soluble. These crystals, at\r\nfirst mistaken for a particular substance, were soon found to be\r\na combination of oxalic acid with the bitter of aloes. The bitter\r\nsubstances of aloes dissolved in 800 parts of water, at 59° F., but\r\nin a smaller quantity of boiling water. This solution has a superb\r\npurple colour. Silk boiled in it acquired a very fine purple colour,\r\non which neither soap nor acids effected any change, except nitric\r\nacid; this changed the colour to yellow, but it was restored simply\r\nby washing in water. All shades may be given to this colour by proper\r\nmordants. Wool is dyed black in a peculiarly beautiful manner, by\r\nthe same process, and light has no influence on the colour. Leather\r\nacquires a purple colour; cotton, a rose colour; but the latter will\r\nnot resist soap. Dr. Liebeg thinks that this is the only substance\r\nfrom which a permanent rose dye for silk may be expected.—_Ann. de\r\nChimie_, xxxv. 72.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. _On the Existence of Crystals of Oxalate of Lime in Plants_.—M.\r\nRaspail has read a memoir to the Academy of Sciences, to prove the\r\nanalogy which exists in arrangement between the crystals of silica,\r\nwhich are found in sponges, and those of oxalate of lime occurring in\r\nthe tissue of phanerogamous plants.\r\n\r\nThe latter crystals were observed, for the first time, by Rafn and\r\nJurine, who regarded them as organs of which they knew not the\r\nuse. They were then observed by M. de Candolle, who called them\r\n_raphides_, and gave a figure of them, which, however, is inaccurate.\r\nThese crystals are really very regular tetraedrons. In many plants,\r\nas _orchis_, _pandanus_, _ornithogalum_, _jacinthus_, _phytolaca_\r\n_decandria_, _mesembryanthemum deltoides_, &c. they are very small,\r\nnot being more than 1/200 of a millimetre (.0002 of an inch) in\r\nwidth, and 1/10 (.004 of an inch) in length. But, in the tubercles\r\nof the Florence iris, they are as much as 1/50 (.0008 of an inch)\r\nin width, and 1/3 (.01312 of an inch) in length, so as to be easily\r\ncapable of examination.—_Bull. Univ._ B. xi. 376.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. _Fallacy of Infusion of Litmus as a Test_, _by_ M. Magnus.—When\r\npure water is heated for a sufficient time with infusion of litmus,\r\nreddened by an acid, it restores the blue colour. It is supposed\r\nthat the heat gradually causes the free sulphuric acid, which had\r\noccasioned the reddening, to combine with the excess of alkali\r\ncontained in the infusion, and thus to cause the restoration of the\r\nblue colour. Hence this preparation cannot be used to test the [p215]\r\npresence of ammonia in a solution, as water alone produces the effect\r\nanticipated from the alkali. The earthy salts contained in ordinary\r\nwater also produce this effect.—_Jour. de Pharmacie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n27. _Tests for the Natural Colouring Matter of Wine_.—M. A. Chevalier\r\nstates,—i. That potash may be employed as a re-agent, to ascertain\r\nthe natural colour of wines, which it changes from red to a bottle\r\ngreen, or brownish green—ii. That the change of colour produced by\r\nthis substance upon wine is different for wine of different ages—iii.\r\nThat no precipitation of the colouring matter takes place, the latter\r\nremaining dissolved by the potash—iv. That the acetate of lead should\r\nnot be employed as a test of the colour of wines, because it is\r\ncapable of producing various colours with wines of a natural colour\r\nonly—v. That the same is the case with lime-water, with muriate of\r\ntin mixed with ammonia, and with subacetate of lead—vi. That ammonia\r\nmay be employed for this purpose, the changes of colour which it\r\nproduces not perceptibly varying—vii. That the same is the case with\r\na solution of alum to which a certain quantity of potash has been\r\nadded, and which may, therefore, be used for the purpose.—_Annales de\r\nl’Industrie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n28. _Test of the Presence of Opium_.—Dr. Hare says he can detect\r\nopium in solution, when the quantity is not more than that given, by\r\nadding ten drops of laudanum to half a gallon of water. The following\r\nis the process:—a few drops of solution of acetate of lead is to\r\nbe added to the solution containing the drug; after some time an\r\nobservable quantity of meconiate of lead will fall down: from six to\r\ntwelve hours may sometimes be required, and the precipitation is best\r\neffected in a conical glass vessel, for then, by gentle stirring now\r\nand then to liberate that which adheres to the side, the insoluble\r\nsalt may be collected together at the bottom. About thirty drops of\r\nsulphuric acid are then to be poured on to the meconiate by means\r\nof a glass tube, after which as much of a solution of red sulphate\r\nof iron is to be added in the same manner. The sulphuric acid will\r\nliberate the meconic acid, and thus enable it to produce with the\r\niron the appropriate colour, which demonstrates the presence of that\r\nacid, and consequently of opium.—_Silliman’s Journal_, xii. 290.\r\n\r\n\r\n29. _Denarcotized Laudanum_.—Thinking it important to ascertain\r\nwhether, by the removal of narcotine from opium, the unpleasant\r\neffects which, according to the opinions at present entertained\r\nupon that subject, are produced by that drug would be removed, Dr.\r\nHare prepared some opium with ether, guided by Robiquet’s statement\r\nthat narcotine was soluble in that fluid: the opium was shaved by\r\nrubbing it on the face of a jack-plane, and subjected four times\r\nsuccessively to as much ether of the specific gravity 0.735 as would\r\ncover it, the operation being performed in a small Papin’s digester,\r\nat a temperature near the boiling point of ether, and each [p216]\r\nportion of the fluid being allowed twenty-four hours for its action.\r\nA crystalline deposition was soon observed in the ether which had\r\nbeen removed from the opium, and, allowing the stopper of the vessel\r\nto remain out, nearly the whole of the liquid evaporated in a few\r\ndays, and left much coloured crystalline matter. This, Dr. Hare has\r\nno doubt, was narcotine in an impure state. The opium was afterwards\r\nsubjected to as much alcohol as would have been required to convert\r\nit into laudanum, had it been in the ordinary state; and this being\r\nadministered medicinally, was found to occasion none of those uneasy\r\nand unpleasant sensations which often follow the use of ordinary\r\nopium.—_Silliman’s Journal_, xii. 291.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. _Extraction of Morphia from Dry Poppy Heads_, by M. Tilloy.—Make\r\nan aqueous extract of the heads, add alcohol to the extract,\r\nseparate the alcoholic solution, and distil it; by this means the\r\ngummy matter is separated. An extract like syrup will be obtained\r\nby the distillation, which, being heated to make it thinner, and of\r\nthe consistency of treacle, is to be again treated with alcohol;\r\na separation of more gum, with much nitrate of potash, will be\r\neffected. The solution being withdrawn, is to be distilled, and\r\nthe extract which will remain is to be acted upon by a sufficient\r\nquantity of water, and filtered, to separate the resinous matter\r\npresent. The morphia may then be separated from this liquid,\r\neither by ammonia, carbonate of soda, or magnesia. Ammonia does\r\nnot precipitate all the morphia; carbonate of soda precipitates a\r\nlarge quantity, but, it separates resinous matter also, which is\r\nfound mingled with the morphia. Magnesia is preferable; but as the\r\nliquid contains much free acetic acid, it is expensive to employ\r\nthe necessary quantity of pure magnesia: the liquid may, therefore,\r\nbe partly saturated, whilst hot, by carbonate of magnesia, or even\r\nby carbonate of lime. A judgment, when no more must be added, must\r\nbe formed from the effervescence; then pure magnesia is to be\r\nadded, which will cause the liberation of ammonia; the whole is to\r\nbe left for twenty-four hours to cool: being then filtered, the\r\nprecipitate is to be washed, and, when dry, acted upon by alcohol.\r\nOperating in this manner, morphia may be obtained from all kinds of\r\npoppies.—_Bull. Univ._ E. viii. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. _Preparation of Morphia_.—Some curious experiments have been\r\ndescribed to the Académie de Médecine, by M. Robinet, relative to\r\nthe preparation of morphia. Having operated on the residue of opium\r\nby muriatic acid, and precipitated the morphia from the muriatic\r\nsolution by lime, he wished to ascertain whether the mother liquor\r\ncontained any morphia that had escaped precipitation. He, therefore,\r\npassed a current of carbonic acid gas through the solution, to\r\nprecipitate the lime in excess: this precipitate being washed,\r\ndried, and acted upon by alcohol, was found mixed with a very large\r\nproportion of morphia, which could [p217] be thus separated. The\r\nwashings of the precipitate being examined, were found free from\r\nmorphia.\r\n\r\nM. Henry observed, at the same time, that, from experiments made\r\nat La Pharmacie Centrale, it appeared that much more morphia\r\nwas obtained in those processes in which lime had been used to\r\nprecipitate the morphia, than in those in which magnesia had been\r\nused.—_Bull. Univ._ C. xi. 225.\r\n\r\n\r\n32. _Easy Method of obtaining Meconic Acid_, by Dr. Hare.—If to\r\nan aqueous infusion of opium we add subacetate of lead, a copious\r\nprecipitation of meconiate of lead ensues: this being collected by\r\na filter, and exposed to sulphuretted hydrogen, meconic acid is\r\nliberated: the solution is of a reddish amber colour, and furnishes,\r\nby evaporation, crystals of the same hue. A very small quantity\r\nproduces a very striking effect in reddening solution of peroxide of\r\niron. Instead of sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphuric acid may be used\r\nto liberate the meconic acid: the presence of the former in excess\r\ndoes not seem to interfere with the power of reddening ferruginous\r\nsolutions, but any excess of sulphuric acid may be removed by\r\nwhitening, which is not acted upon sensibly by meconic acid; Yet, the\r\nacid procured in this way did not crystallize so handsomely, or with\r\nso much facility, as that obtained by sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n33. _On a New Vegetable Acid_.—This acid is crystallizable, but the\r\nforms have not as yet been determined: it is less soluble in cold\r\nwater than tartaric acid; its aqueous solution precipitates lime\r\nwater in white floculi, just like tartaric acid, but the precipitate,\r\nif dissolved in muriatic acid, re-appears on adding ammonia, whilst\r\nthat produced by tartaric acid does not produce this effect. The\r\nnew acid has a greater affinity for lime than muriatic or nitric\r\nacids, for it precipitates the muriate and nitrate of this earth in\r\nthe manner of oxalic acid, but it differs from the latter in not\r\nprecipitating a solution of sulphate of lime. With potash it forms an\r\nacid salt, slightly soluble in cold water: it precipitates acetate\r\nof lead, and the precipitate holds much water in combination: the\r\ntartrate of lead, on the contrary, is anhydrous. Notwithstanding\r\nthese circumstances, the equivalent number of this acid is within\r\na few thousandths of that of tartaric acid: when distilled, it is\r\ndecomposed, and produces an acid yellow liquid like tartaric acid,\r\nleaving a light charcoal burning without residuum. M. Gay Lussac is\r\nengaged in developing the chemical history of this substance.—_Bull.\r\nUniv._ A. vii. 327.\r\n\r\n\r\n34. _Altheine, a new Vegetable Principle_.—M. Bacon gives the\r\nfollowing directions for the preparation of this substance, which\r\nhe has discovered in the _Althea officinalis_. An extract of the\r\nroots of the plant is to be made by means of cold water, and, when\r\nconcentrated, [p218] acted upon by boiling alcohol: the latter\r\nwill dissolve the acid malate of altheine, oil, &c.: the different\r\nalcoholic decoctions are to be put together and will throw down a\r\ncrystalline deposite as they cool; the latter is to be separated\r\nand dissolved in water, and the solution, when filtered, is to be\r\nevaporated by a moderate heat, until like a syrup, and then set aside\r\nto crystallize. The crystals procured are to be washed with a small\r\nquantity of pure water, to separate the yellow matter from them, and\r\nthen dried upon paper. These crystals appear, to the naked eye, like\r\ngrains, needles, and feathers, but under the microscope present a\r\nhexaedral form. They are of a fine emerald green colour, transparent,\r\nbrilliant, inodorous; unaltered in the air; they redden litmus\r\npaper, are soluble in water, and insoluble in alcohol. The aqueous\r\nsolution of these crystals, acted upon by cold magnesia and filtered,\r\nthen restores the colour of reddened litmus paper; renders syrup of\r\nviolets green; and when evaporated furnishes the altheine free from\r\nmalic acid. When thus pure, the substance crystallizes in regular\r\nhexaedral forms or in rhomboidal octoedrons; it affects litmus and\r\nviolets as just described: it is transparent, of an emerald green\r\ncolour, brilliant, inodorous, slightly sapid, unaltered by air, very\r\nsoluble in water, not soluble in alcohol, soluble in acetic acid,\r\nwith which it forms a crystalline salt.—_Ann. de Chimie_, xxxiv. 201.\r\n\r\n\r\n35. _Rheine, a new Substance from Rhubarb_.—By acting upon one part\r\nof Chinese rhubarb with 8 parts of nitric acid, s. g. 1.32, at a\r\nmoderate temperature, reducing the whole to the consistence of syrup,\r\nand then diffusing it through water, M. Vaudin obtained a precipitate\r\nwhich possessed peculiar characters, and to which he gave the name\r\nof _Rheine_. When dry, it is of an orange yellow colour, without any\r\nparticular odour, and slightly bitter. It dissolves in water as well\r\nas in alcohol and ether: the solutions become yellow by acids, and\r\nrose red by alkalis. It burns nearly in the manner of amadou. Rhubarb\r\nacted upon by ether only gave a similar substance, a circumstance\r\nwhich proves that Rheine exists ready formed in rhubarb, and that it\r\nis not acted upon by nitric acid.—_Ann. de Chimie_, xxxiv. 192.\r\n\r\n\r\n36. _On Dragon’s Blood, and a new Substance which it contains_,\r\n_by_ M. Melandri.—Pure dragon’s blood is, according to M. Melandri,\r\na scarce substance; the drops in which it occurs are rarely\r\ntransparent, generally opaque, and with a rough fracture: its colour\r\nis blood red. Besides being soluble in alcohol it is entirely soluble\r\nin oil and also in hot water, though a large quantity of the latter\r\nfluid is required for the purpose. The aqueous solution is bitter,\r\nastringent, and of a fine purple colour; by cooling, it becomes milky\r\nand red. Gelatine does not alter its appearance; a proof that the\r\nsubstance contains no tannin. Sulphate of iron forms a pale reddish\r\nprecipitate, so that no evidence of gallic acid is afforded. [p219]\r\n\r\nSupposing that this substance might contain a principle analogous to\r\nthat latterly observed by M. Pelletier in logwood, &c. a portion of\r\nit was dissolved in strong alcohol, the solution evaporated until\r\nvery concentrated, and then poured into cold water, an agglomerated\r\nspongy substance was precipitated, which, after being washed with\r\ncold water and filtered, was triturated with water containing\r\n1/100th of sulphuric acid, and exhibited traces of chemical action\r\nat a temperature of 22° (61°.6 F.) It then deposited a substance\r\nupon the sides of the vessel, and the liquid became yellow and very\r\nacid. The sediment, being carefully washed with water, was of a fine\r\nred colour, varying according to the state of aggregation; it had\r\nno taste or smell; was flexible between the fingers, and was quite\r\nfluid at 55° (131° F.). This substance, which the author has called\r\n_Dracine_, has some analogy with the vegeto-alkalis, although its\r\naffinity for acids is but slight. The sulphate may be obtained, he\r\nsays, by adding sulphuric acid diluted with alcohol to an alcoholic\r\nsolution of _dracine_, precipitating the mixture by cold water, and\r\nthen applying a little heat; the sulphate of dracine collects at the\r\nbottom, is to be washed with cold water until the latter no longer\r\nreddens litmus paper, and then dissolved in hot water. This solution\r\nbecomes red by the smallest quantity of alkalis, and may be used as\r\na very sensible test of their presence. Dracine is also a good test\r\nfor acids, assuming a yellow colour with them. The small quantity of\r\ncarbonate of lime in filtering paper may be detected by sulphate of\r\ndracine, the yellow solution instantly becoming red from its action,\r\nand thus showing its presence.—_Bull. Univ._ C. xi. p. 157.\r\n\r\n\r\n37. _Purification of Madder, by the Separation of its Yellow\r\nColouring Matter_.—The experiments of MM. Kuhlman, Colin, and\r\nRobiquet[36], have induced M. G. H. de Kurrer to publish the means\r\nwhich he has resorted to for the purification of madder, by the\r\nseparation of the yellow colouring matter from it; and thus rendering\r\nit more fit to supply the various red, lilac, violet, and brown\r\ncolours which are required upon wool, silk, cotton and linen. Three\r\ntubs or vessels are placed by the side of each other: in summer they\r\nmay be in the open air under shelter, but in the winter should be\r\nplaced in an airy cellar where the temperature may be retained at 18°\r\nor 20° R. (73° to 77° F.). The first is that in which the soaking and\r\nfermentation is to be effected: it should be 2 feet 8 inches deep,\r\nand 2 feet 6 inches in diameter, for from fifty to fifty-five pounds\r\nof madder. The second, or washing vessel, should be 5-1/2 feet deep,\r\nand 3 feet in diameter; it should have three wooden cocks fixed into\r\nit, the first 2 feet, the second 3 feet, and the third 4 feet from\r\nthe bottom. The third tub is for deposition; its height should be\r\n4-1/2 feet, and it should have a cock at 1-1/2 foot from the bottom.\r\n[p220]\r\n\r\nOn commencing the operation, 50 or 55 lb. of pulverised madder are\r\nto be put into the first vessel, water is to be added, and stirred\r\ninto the mass until it stands 1-1/2 inch above the madder. The whole\r\nis then to be left until fermentation comes on and has formed a coat\r\nof madder at the surface; this usually takes place in 36 hours,\r\nand at latest in 48 hours, according to the temperature. The mass\r\nshould now be transferred into the second vessel, which is then to\r\nbe filled with water, and being left for two hours, the madder will\r\nfall to the bottom. The upper cock is then to be opened, after that\r\nthe second, and then the third; and the water which runs from the\r\ntwo latter is to be put into the third vessel, that the rest of the\r\nmadder may separate from it. The madder in the second vessel is then\r\nto be washed a second, third, or fourth time until the washing water\r\nis colourless. Thus purified, the madder may be used in the processes\r\nof dyeing, according to the known methods; but it is important in\r\nsummer that it should be used immediately, that a new (the vinous)\r\nfermentation may be avoided. The madder deposited in the third\r\nvessel, when washed and deposited, may be used like the rest. The\r\nliquid first separated after the fermentation may be used in the\r\npreparation of hot indigo baths, &c. instead of madder.—_Bull. Univ._\r\nP. vii. 352.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [36] See page 239 of the last volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n38. _On Indigo and Indigogene, by M. Liebeg_.—1-1/2 part of pure\r\nindigo, 2 parts of proto-sulphate of iron, 2-1/2 parts of hydrate\r\nof lime, and from 50 to 60 parts of water, were digested together\r\nfor 24 hours in a close vessel, which had previously been filled\r\nwith hydrogen. The clear liquor over the sulphate of lime and\r\noxide of iron, had a yellowish red colour, and was separated by\r\na syphon filled with hydrogen, and mixed with diluted muriatic\r\nacid, containing some sulphite of ammonia dissolved; a dense white\r\nprecipitate was formed, becoming blue in the air. This was gathered\r\nin a filter without contact of air, and washed with boiled water\r\ncontaining sulphite of ammonia in solution, and dried at 212°, in\r\nclose vessels, through which a current of hydrogen was continually\r\npassed. The upper surface of the mass became of a blue colour, but\r\nthe lower remained of a dull white.\r\n\r\nThis white substance was called Indigogene. It did not change colour\r\nin dry air, but under water became of a deep blue, which by drying,\r\nassumed a coppery appearance. The blue substance volatilized by heat\r\nwithout leaving any residue, forming purple vapours, which condensed,\r\nwhen cold, into crystals differing in nothing from sublimed indigo.\r\n_Indigogene_ dissolves in alkalis without neutralizing them: it is\r\nalso soluble in alcohol, but insoluble in water or acids.\r\n\r\nA given quantity of this indigogene was acted upon by ammonia, and\r\nthe weight of the undissolved blue portion ascertained, it appeared\r\nthat the weight of the pure portion dissolved was 0.404 grammes\r\n(6.224 grains.) The solution was put into an inverted [p221] jar,\r\nover mercury, and oxygen gas gradually passed in until absorption\r\nceased, and then the liquid containing the precipitated indigo was\r\nevaporated to dryness at 212°. The weight of the substance was\r\nincreased to 0.047, _i. e._ 11.5 per cent.\r\n\r\nNot having obtained indigogene _perfectly_ pure, M. Liebeg did not\r\nattempt to analyze it for the ultimate composition. He remarks,\r\nthat indigo is, perhaps, the only organic body from which one of\r\nits constituent parts may be taken without total decomposition; and\r\nwhich, by oxidation, passes to the state of an indifferent body,\r\nhaving much analogy with peroxides.—_Ann. de Chimie_, xxxv. 269.\r\n\r\n\r\n39. _On the mutual Action of Ethers, and other Substances_.—From\r\nexperiments made by M. Henry, he concludes that when metals easily\r\noxidizable, or oxides which unite with acetic acid, are put into\r\nsulphuric ether, they produce larger or smaller quantities of\r\nacetates, probably, not by decomposing the sulphuric ether, but\r\nthe acetic ether which is always mixed with it; and that it is in\r\nconsequence of the saturation of the acetic acid set free from the\r\nether by this decomposition, that sulphuric ether does not redden\r\nlitmus paper when evaporated, whereas it acts differently when being\r\nslightly heated, the quantity of acetic ether contained in it is\r\nallowed to decompose by the action of the air.\r\n\r\nNitric and acetic ethers are described as being easily decomposed by\r\nthe action of many bodies without the assistance of heat, if aided by\r\ntime. Amongst the products of the action are the acids of the ethers,\r\nacetates, and alcohol which dissolves the salts formed.—_Jour. de\r\nChimie Méd_.\r\n\r\n\r\n40. _Faraday’s Chemical Manipulation_.—The kindness of a friend at\r\nBristol has pointed out to me an error in the directions relative to\r\nalkalimetry, which I have given in the above work: this I am desirous\r\nof correcting, and, by permission of Mr. Brande, have the opportunity\r\nof doing so in the _Quarterly Journal of Science_.\r\n\r\nThe mistake, which arose from using the wrong specific gravity of two\r\nthat were required in calculation, occurs in the paragraphs (599,\r\n600,) but fortunately is prevented from occasioning any experimental\r\nerror by the directions given in (602). The acid of specific gravity,\r\n1.141, directed to be used, is too strong for the quantities marked\r\nupon the tube. The substitution of one of specific gravity 1.127,\r\nwill correct the error, and may be obtained very nearly by mixing 19\r\nparts, by weight, of strong oil of vitriol, with 81 parts of water.\r\n\r\nThe alterations required may be made in the volume with a pen, as\r\nfor errors of the press, by reading “1.127” for “1.141” in lines 25\r\nand 30 of page 276, and lines 2 and 13 of page 277; and “nineteen”\r\nfor “one” in line 27, and “eighty-one” for “four” in line 28 of page\r\n276.—M. F. [p222]\r\n\r\n\r\n III. NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _On the Supposed Influence of the Moon_, by M. Arago.—There\r\nis an impression very general with gardeners, that the moon has\r\na particular effect on plants, especially in certain months. The\r\ngardeners near Paris gave the name of the _lune rousse_ to the moon,\r\nwhich, beginning in April, becomes full either at the end of the\r\nmonth, or more generally in May. According to them the light of the\r\nmoon, in the months of April and May, injures the shoots of plants,\r\nand that, when the sky is clear, the leaves and buds exposed to this\r\nlight become red or brown, and are killed, though the thermometer\r\nin the atmosphere is several degrees above the freezing point: they\r\nconfirm this observation, by remarking that, when the rays of the\r\nmoon are stopped in consequence of the existence of clouds in the\r\nair, that then the plants are not injured, although the temperature\r\nand other circumstances are the same.\r\n\r\nM. Arago explains this observation of practical men, by a reference\r\nto the facts and principles established by Dr. Wells. He has shown\r\nthat, in a clear night, exposed bodies may frequently have their\r\ntemperatures reduced below that of the surrounding atmosphere,\r\nsolely by the effect of radiation, the difference being as much as\r\n6, 7, 10, or more degrees, but that it does not take place when the\r\nheavens are obscured. M. Arago then observes, that the temperature\r\nis often not more than 4, 5, or 6 degrees above the freezing point\r\nduring the nights of April and May, and that when the night is clear,\r\nconsequently when the moon is bright, the temperature of the leaves\r\nand buds may often be brought by radiation below the freezing point,\r\nwhilst the air remains above it, and consequently an effect be\r\nproduced, which, though not dependent upon, accompanies the brilliant\r\nunobscured state of the moon—the absence of these injurious effects,\r\nwhen the moon is obscured, being also as perfectly accounted for\r\nby these principles, from the knowledge that the same clouds which\r\nobscure the moon will prevent the radiation of heat from the plants.\r\nHence, as M. Arago observes, the observation of the gardener is\r\ncorrect as far as it goes, though the interpretation of the effect\r\nwhich he generally gives is incorrect.—_Annuaire du Bureau des Long._\r\n1827, p. 162.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Luminous Appearances in the Atmosphere_.—An account is given at\r\npage 242 of our last volume, from Silliman’s Journal, of certain\r\nspots in the air near the horizon, which have been seen highly\r\nluminous in Ohio, United States, by Mr. Atwater, and which often\r\ninduce the supposition that fires exist in their direction. Mr.\r\nWebster says—“I have observed similar phenomena in New England: I\r\nrecollect one instance, when I resided at Amherst, in Hampshire\r\nCounty, Mass., a bright light in the north-east, near [p223] the\r\nhorizon, appeared as the light of a building on fire appears at\r\nnight, at the distance of several miles. I expected, in that\r\ninstance, every hour to hear that some building in Shutesbury, or\r\nNew Salem, had been burnt, and, so strong was my belief of it, that\r\nI repeatedly asked my neighbours whether they had heard of any such\r\nevent. At last, I met a gentleman who had just come from one of those\r\ntowns, who told me he had heard of no fire from that quarter, which\r\nconvinced me the phenomenon was merely atmospheric.”—_Silliman’s\r\nJournal_, xii. 380.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _On the Determination of the Mean Temperature of the Air_.—This\r\nsubject has been investigated by M. G. G. Hallstrœm, who gives the\r\nfollowing algebraic formula, which correctly represents the mean\r\ntemperature for all Europe.\r\n\r\n _v_ = 1/2 (_x_ _f_ + _x__e_)−0.33 + 0.41 sin. [(_n_−1) 30° + 124° 8′]\r\n\r\n _v_ = mean temperature.\r\n\r\n_n_ = the ordinal number of the month for which the temperature is to\r\nbe calculated (thus, for March, _n_ = 3).\r\n\r\n1/2 (_x_ _f_ + _x_ _e_) = the mean temperature taken as the mean of\r\nobservations taken at ten o’clock in the morning and evening.\r\n\r\nIn winter 1/2 (_x_ _f_ + _x_ _e_) = _v_ very nearly; whilst, in\r\nsummer, this quantity is 3/4 of a degree greater than _v_ at Paris,\r\nHalle, and Abo.—_Annal. der Phys. und Chem._ 1825, p. 373.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Indelible Writing_.—As the art of man can unmake whatever the\r\nart of man can make, we have no right to expect an _indelible ink_:\r\nhowever, a sort of approximation to it may be made as follows:—Let\r\na saturated solution of indigo and madder in boiling water be made,\r\nin such proportions as give a purple tint; add to it from one sixth\r\nto one eighth of its weight of sulphuric acid, according to the\r\nthickness and strength of the paper to be used: this makes an ink\r\nwhich flows pretty freely from the pen, and when writing, which has\r\nbeen executed with it, is exposed to a considerable, but gradual,\r\nheat from the fire, it becomes completely black, the letters being\r\nburnt in and charred by the action of the sulphuric acid. _If the\r\nacid has not been used in sufficient quantity to destroy the texture\r\nof the paper, and reduce it to the state of tinder, the colour may be\r\ndischarged by the oxymuriatic and oxalic acids, and their compounds,\r\nthough not without great difficulty_. When the full proportion of\r\nacid has been employed, a little crumpling and rubbing of the paper\r\nreduces the carbonaceous matter of the letters to powder; but by\r\nputting a black ground behind them, they may be preserved, and thus a\r\nspecies of _indelible writing_ is procured, (for the letters are, in\r\na manner, stamped out of the paper,) which might be useful for some\r\npurposes, perhaps for the signature of bank-notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Peculiar Crystals of Quartz_.—Mr. W. Phillips has met with some\r\nremarkable crystals of quartz, which occurred imbedded in the [p224]\r\nlimestone of the Black-rock, near Cork. They are from the fourth\r\nto the half of an inch in length, and about half their length in\r\nwidth: they are smooth, externally, for the most part, and sometimes\r\nconsiderably bright; they are of the colour termed smoky, or brown\r\nquartz, externally, and may easily be separated from the limestone,\r\nleaving a cavity of their exact form. On trying to cleave them, they\r\nyielded parallel to one or other of the planes of the pyramid, like\r\ncommon quartz, but at such fractures appeared to consist of alternate\r\nand concentric prisms of smoky transparent quartz, and of gray\r\nopaque, and somewhat granular limestone. On applying muriatic acid to\r\nthe surface, effervescence occurred along the gray parts, proving the\r\npresence of limestone, but soon ceased: after an action continued for\r\nsome weeks, the gray parts became cellular, and so soft, as to admit\r\nof being scraped by a knife. Mr. Phillips says, it seems reasonable\r\nto conclude that such part of the gray substance as does not yield to\r\nthe action of the acid is siliceous or quartzose; and that the prime\r\ndifference between it and the smoky quartz surrounding it consists in\r\nthe different circumstances of crystalline aggregation under which\r\nthey are deposited. The crystals, with the somewhat analogous case of\r\nthe Fontainebleau sandstone, may serve to assist in the illustration\r\nof some points relative to the laws of affinity, as operating in the\r\nformation of crystals.—_Phil. Mag._ N. S., ii. 123.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Native Iron not Meteoric_.—The following notice is by Mr. C. A.\r\nLee. Native iron, on Canaan mountain, a mile and a half from the\r\nSouth Meetinghouse (Conn. U. S.). This is particularly interesting,\r\nas it is the first instance in which native iron, not meteoric,\r\nhas been found in America. It was discovered by Major Barrall, of\r\nCanaan, while employed in surveying, many years ago. It formed a thin\r\nstratum, or plate, in a mass of mica slate, which seemed to have been\r\nbroken from an adjoining ledge. It presents the usual characters of\r\nnative iron, and is easily malleable. For some distance around the\r\nplace where it was found the needle will not traverse, and a great\r\nproportion of the tallest trees have been struck with lightning.\r\nWhether these phenomena are connected with the existence of a large\r\nmass of native iron, I leave for others to determine: the facts,\r\nhowever, may be relied on.\r\n\r\nThe specimen has been examined chemically, by Mr. Shepherd, at\r\nYale College. It is invested with highly crystalline plumbago, and\r\nsplits by the intervention of plates of plumbago into pyramidal and\r\ntetrahedral masses. It is not equal to meteoric iron in malleability,\r\ntoughness, and flexibility, and has not the silvery white appearance\r\nof that iron. Its specific gravity is from 5.95 to 6.72. It has\r\nnative steel intermingled in it, but contains no nickel, or any other\r\nalloy.\r\n\r\nMajor Barrall has only been to the place where this iron occurred\r\n_once_, and no other person has ever been to the place, or knows\r\nwhere it is.—_Silliman’s Journal_, xii. 154. [p225]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Native Argentiferous Gold_.—M. Boussingault, who has had the\r\nopportunity of examining numerous specimens of argentiferous native\r\ngold from the Columbian mines, thinks that they are atomic; he has\r\nfound 1 atom of silver united to 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 atoms of gold,\r\nand considers it probable that the other combinations to complete\r\nthe series may occur. He has assumed 24.86 as the number for gold,\r\nand 27.03 as the number for silver. The following are some of the\r\nexperimental results:—\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Marmato_.—Pale yellow octoedral crystals:\r\n Gold      73.45      3 atoms      73.40\r\n Silver    26.48      1   \"        26.60\r\n Loss      00.07\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Titiribi:_\r\n Gold      74.00      3 atoms      73.40\r\n Silver    26.00      1   \"        26.60\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Malpaso_.—Yellow irregular flattened grains:\r\n Gold      88.24      8 atoms      88.04\r\n Silver    11.76      1   \"        11.96\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Rio-Sucio_.—Deep-coloured large irregular grains:\r\n Gold      87.94      8 atoms      88.04\r\n Silver    12.06      1   \"        11.96\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of the Otra Mina_.—Pale yellow octoedral crystals:\r\n Gold      73.4       3 atoms      73.40\r\n Silver    26.6       1   \"        26.60\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Guamo_.—Brass-yellow indeterminate crystals:\r\n Gold     73.68       3 atoms      73.40\r\n Silver   26.32       1   \"        26.60\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Llano_.—Small flattened grains—reddish:\r\n Gold     88.58       8 atoms      88.04\r\n Silver   11.42       1   \"        11.96\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Baja_.—Porous:\r\n Gold     88.15       8 atoms      88.04\r\n Silver   11.85       1   \"        11.96\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Ojas-Anchas_.—Yellowish red plates:\r\n Gold     84.5        6 atoms      84.71\r\n Silver   15.5        1   \"        15.29\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Trinidad, near Santa Rosa de Osos_.—A solid piece\r\n of 50 grains:\r\n Gold     82.4        4 atoms      82.14\r\n Silver   17.6        1   \"        17.86\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Transylvania (Europe)_.—Pale yellow cubic crystals:\r\n Gold     64.52       2 atoms      64.77\r\n Silver   35.48       1   \"        35.23\r\n\r\n _Native Gold of Santa Rosa de Osos_.—A mass weighing 710 grains:\r\n Gold     64.93       2 atoms      64.77\r\n Silver   35.07       1   \"        35.23\r\n\r\nM. Boussingault has remarked a singlar deficiency in the [p226]\r\nspecific gravity of the native alloys of gold and silver when\r\ncompared with calculation, or with the results obtained from an alloy\r\nsimilar in composition prepared by fusion; thus the native gold of\r\nMarmato has a specific gravity of 12.666, whereas, by calculation, it\r\nought to be 16.931. The gold of Malpaso, by experiment, is 14.706, by\r\ncalculation, 18.223, and by fusion, 18.1. The gold of Santa Rosa, by\r\nexperiment, is 14.149, and by calculation, 16.175. This difference,\r\nM. Boussingault says, is not due to porosity in the native gold, as\r\nhe has observed it in the granular and fine varieties, but a peculiar\r\ncharacter of the metal in this state. Such an enormous difference,\r\nhowever, is one that can be admitted only upon repeated experimental\r\nproofs, made in the most unexceptionable manner; and, considering\r\nthat it is only in some of the metals that any permanent difference\r\nin specific gravity can be established, and even with them to but a\r\nsmall extent, would be a fact so important as to be worth extreme\r\ntrouble in the verification.—_Annales de Chimie_, xxxiv. 408.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Prothéeïte—a new Mineral_.—This mineral was discovered in 1826,\r\nat Rothenkoph, in the valley of Zillerthal, Tyrol. It occurs in\r\nrectangular prisms, generally without distinct summits, and rough\r\nat both ends. The angles are very seldom truncated, the faces are\r\nstriated longitudinally. The crystals are of various sizes, some\r\nbeing very small, but they have occurred 5 inches in length, and two\r\nin width; the longitudinal fracture is lamellar, the cross-fracture\r\nconchoidal. The substance is usually fissured, nearly opaque in large\r\nspecimens, translucent or diaphanous in small masses. Its colour is\r\ncrysolite green or white, or between the two; its lustre between that\r\nof glass and the diamond; it is heavy; a good conductor of heat;\r\nhard enough to scratch glass; infusible before the blowpipe; highly\r\nelectric by friction. The white crystals have a fibrous texture,\r\nwhich, as well as the colour, seems the result of decomposition. When\r\ncut and polished, the mineral assumes a great variety of aspects;\r\nthe green parts then resemble the finest crysolites, but the fibrous\r\nwhite parts, when cut of a round form, present one or two reflections\r\non a transparent ground which move as the stone is moved, just like\r\nthose from the cat’s eye; these reflections are very brilliant, and\r\nare accompanied by numerous iris colours, which move like those on\r\nthe opal. This phenomenon is often observed in the rough stone,\r\nwhich, when exposed to light, exhibit certain deep red tints of a\r\ncupreous colour, and metallic lustre on all the faces.—_Bull. Univ._\r\nB. xi. 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Volcanic Bisulphuret of Copper_.—M. N. Covelli, during his\r\nexaminations of Mount Vesuvius, has observed some particular actions\r\ngoing on, especially in the fumeroles on the eastern side of the\r\nmountain, and within the crater. Speaking of the former, he says,\r\n“Here there are fumeroles in which pure chloride of lead [p227]\r\nsublimes into white and yellow crystallizations, which fusing in the\r\nhotter places form nacres, gum, and stalactites. In many parts the\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, evolved within the fumeroles, reacts on the\r\nchloride, and forms sulphuret of lead, dispersed in small scales\r\nthrough the scoria. Other fumeroles produce very thin scales of the\r\nblack oxide of copper; these are very brilliant, metalloidal, and\r\nflexible, and are produced by the action of the vapour of water\r\nat a red heat on the chloride of copper, which may be observed on\r\ndisturbing the fumeroles. Here and there the reaction of aqueous\r\nvapour on the perchloride of iron produces metalloidal scales of\r\nthe peroxide of iron; whilst further on, the same vapour, acting\r\non mixtures of the two chlorides, produces oligiste iron in small\r\ncrystals, aggregated on the scoria. The muriatic acid resulting\r\nfrom these actions, and the sulphuric acid which is formed by the\r\ndecomposition of hydrosulphurets and sulphates, attack the iron,\r\nlime, copper, alumine, potash, &c., in the lavas and scoria, and\r\nhence result a number of other productions which line the passages of\r\nthe fumeroles”.\r\n\r\nM. Covelli descended into the crater, until within 300 feet of the\r\nedge of the large eastern opening, from which the great current of\r\nlava flowed in 1822. Here the fumeroles presented the most beautiful\r\ncrystallizations of sulphate of lime and sulphur. On examining the\r\nscoria they were found incrusted and covered with a substance,\r\nhaving all the shades of colour belonging to blue, green, and black.\r\nSometimes it resembled a spider’s web in appearance, sometimes\r\nsoot deposited in the cavities of the scoria. Many specimens were\r\ncollected, and also a portion of water condensed from the vapours\r\nwhich issued forth, and which evidently contained sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen and muriatic acid. The temperature of the vapour was as high\r\nas 85° C., in some places, and even up to 90°, at half a foot beneath\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nThe water being examined was found to contain only a little\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, and a little muriatic acid. The black\r\nsubstance was soon ascertained to be a pure sulphuret of copper.\r\nBeing analyzed, 100 parts yielded 32 parts of sulphur, and 66 of\r\ncopper, a loss of two parts being incurred, which accords very nearly\r\nwith the composition of the bi-sulphuret of copper. The blue and\r\nbluish-green substances were found to be mixtures of this sulphuret\r\nwith sulphate and hydro-sulphuret of copper.\r\n\r\nM. Covelli concludes that this substance has been formed by the\r\naction of sulphuretted hydrogen on the sulphate and muriate of copper\r\nevolved by these fumeroles; and observes, that its composition\r\naccords with such an opinion, the deutoxide being that which forms\r\nthe Vesuvian cupreous salts.—_Ann. de Chimie_, xxxv. 105.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Fall of the Lake Souwando in Russia_.—This lake, situated in\r\nthe parish of Sakkola, in the Russian government of Wibourg, and\r\nsurrounded by the lands of the Barons Friedrichs, was near [p228] 40\r\nversts in length, and had the form of a Γ, or Greek G. Before the\r\nyear 1818, it was separated from the lake of Ladoga by an interval\r\nabout a verst in width, called Taipale, on which was a sandy hill;\r\nits waters flowed into the river Wuoxa, which united the lakes of\r\nSaima and Ladoga. On the 14th May, 1818, the waters of the lake\r\nSouwando, increased by the thaw and the tempests, overcame the\r\nnatural dyke at the foot of the lake, threw down the hill of sand,\r\nrapidly flowed into the lower lake, carrying away all the surrounding\r\ngrounds, and for ever destroyed the barrier which had previously\r\nseparated them. A chapel and a countryman’s house were carried away\r\nwith the pastures and meadows; the waters of the lower lake were much\r\ndisturbed, and the surface covered with ruins. The level of the lake\r\nSouwando fell 12-1/2 archines, and its length is now only 15 versts.\r\nIts waters no longer flow off by the Wuoxa, but pass into the lower\r\nlake by several falls through a deep canal. The land which has been\r\nuncovered by the water is already cultivated, and the beauty of the\r\nsurrounding country said to be increased.—_Bull. Univ._, F. x. 133.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _Vegetable Torpor observed in the Roots of the Black\r\nMulberry-tree_.—A very old mulberry-tree was broken into four\r\nquarters by the wind in 1790. Two of the quarters were destroyed,\r\nthe other two remained growing for a few years, but the last of\r\nthem was removed in 1802. An elder-tree grew in the place of the\r\nmulberry-tree, without doubt from berries which had fallen into\r\nthe middle of the old trunk of the latter. This elder-tree died in\r\n1826, and at the time of its languishing about a dozen of mulberry\r\nshoots started forth to the day. M. Dureau de la Malle ascertained\r\nthat these did not spring from seeds, but from the roots of the old\r\nmulberry-tree, which had thus lain in the ground in an apparently\r\ninactive state, for 24 years, to send forth shoots at last.—_Ann. de\r\nSciences Nat._ ix. 338.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Method of increasing the Odour of Roses_.—For this purpose,\r\naccording to the author of the method, a large onion is to be planted\r\nby the side of the rose tree in such a manner that it shall touch\r\nthe foot of the latter. The roses which will be produced will have\r\nan odour much stronger and more agreeable than such as have not been\r\nthus treated, and the water distilled from these roses is equally\r\nsuperior to that prepared by means of ordinary rose leaves.—_Œkonom.\r\nNeuigk._;—_Bull. Univ._\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Pine Apples_.—A great improvement may be made in keeping pine\r\napples by twisting off their crowns, which are generally suffered to\r\nremain and to live upon the fruit till they have sucked out all the\r\ngoodness. It will be very easy for fruiterers to keep a few crowns by\r\nthem in water, which can be pegged or stuck on with dough, for show,\r\nwhen the fruit is served up, or artificial ones [p229] may be made. A\r\npine apple will keep for a long time when its crown is removed, and\r\nwill also be greatly improved in flavour, for the more aqueous parts\r\nof the fruit gradually evaporate, and leave it much more saccharine\r\nand vinous in its flavour; which natural process is totally destroyed\r\nby the vegetation of the crown, just upon the same principle that an\r\nonion or carrot loses its flavour when it begins to sprout in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _Mode of Condensing and Preserving Vegetable Substances for\r\nShips’ Provision, &c._—The quantity of liquid matter which enters\r\ninto the constitution of vegetables is very great; when they are\r\ndeprived of it their bulk is very trifling. That preparation of\r\nanimal food called _pemmican_, in which six pounds of meat are\r\ncondensed into the space of one, is mainly effected by abstracting\r\nall the fluid from it. Vegetables may be treated in the same way: let\r\nthem undergo the process of boiling over a fierce wood fire, so as\r\nto preserve their colour when _completely_ cooked; grind them into\r\na complete pulp by some such means as are used to crush apples for\r\ncider, &c.; then let them be subjected to the action of the press,\r\n(being first put into hair bags, or treated as grapes are in wine\r\ncountries,) till all the fluid matter is separated from them; the\r\nremainder of their substance becomes wonderfully condensed, and as\r\nhard as the _marc_ from the wine press. Then let it be rammed hard\r\ninto carefully glazed air-tight jars, (or tin cases, if preferred,)\r\nand subjected to the Appertian process for preserving animal and\r\nvegetable matters, (well known, by-the-by, to our grandmothers, who\r\npreserved gooseberries in this way from time immemorial.) If jars\r\nare used, they may be sufficiently secured by having two pieces of\r\nbladder tied successively over them; when the air within is absorbed\r\nby heating the inclosed substance, their surface becomes concave by\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere, and as long as it remains in this\r\nstate the matter within is safe. If it should be thought requisite to\r\npreserve the flavour of the vegetables entire, an extract should be\r\nmade from the expressed liquid, and added to the _marc_. But spinage,\r\ncabbage, and many others, have abundance of flavour in them in their\r\ndry state without this addition. The preparation of the vegetable\r\nmatter for use is accomplished by adding a sufficient quantity of\r\nmilk, water, gravy, lime juice, &c., to the _marc_, and warming it\r\nup. Let the government, and the dealers in ships’ provision, look to\r\nthis; a sufficient quantity of this _vegetable pemmican_ would be\r\nthe greatest luxury to a ship’s crew, and render the scurvy utterly\r\nobsolete. It is worthy of remark, that the most irritable stomach is\r\nnot offended by vegetables treated in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _Rewards for the Discovery of Quinia, and for Lithotrity_.—The\r\nAcadémie des Sciences has adjudged a prize of 10,000 francs to MM.\r\nPelletier and Caventou, for their discovery and introduction [p230]\r\ninto use of sulphate of quinia; and another prize of 10,000 francs to\r\nM. Civiale, for having been the first to practise lithotrity on the\r\nliving body, and for having successfully operated by his method on a\r\ngreat number of persons afflicted with the stone in the bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. _Upon the Gaseous Exhalations of the Skin_.—M. Collard de\r\nMartigny, having experimented on this subject, has obtained results\r\nwhich tend to reconcile the differences existing between previous\r\nobservers. The Count de Milly first announced, in the year 1777, that\r\nan aëriform fluid escapes in great quantity from the surface of the\r\nskin, and he considered the gas as carbonic acid. Cruikshank, Jurene,\r\nand Abernethy participated in this opinion. Ingenhouz, on the other\r\nhand, maintained that the air so secreted was azote. M. Frousset\r\nadopted the opinion of Ingenhouz, and endeavoured to confirm it by\r\nexperiments. Lastly, Priestley and Fontana questioned the reality of\r\na gaseous exhalation from the skin; and Fourcroy positively denied it.\r\n\r\nFrom the experiments of M. Collard de Martigny, he deduces,\r\n\r\ni. That a gaseous exhalation really takes place from the skin.\r\n\r\nii. This exhalation is not morbid: it is observable in health.\r\n\r\niii. It is composed of carbonic acid and azote, in very variable\r\nproportions. The following experiment was frequently made. The\r\nbubbles of air which are disengaged from the skin were received into\r\na funnel, the top of which was closed: they were then passed into a\r\ngraduated tube, and agitated with a solution of potash. The height\r\nto which the solution rose in the tube indicated the quantities of\r\ncarbonic acid that had been absorbed. All these operations were made\r\nat the same temperature and pressure. Neither hydrogen nor oxygen gas\r\nwere discovered in this air.\r\n\r\niv. It does occur continually; but very often we may vainly attempt\r\nto discover it, which has been the cause of error in the results of\r\nPriestley, Fontana and Fourcroy. It is especially suspended after\r\nexercise long continued in the middle of the day, or immediately\r\nafter taking an abundant meal. Sometimes it is suspended without any\r\napparent cause.\r\n\r\nv. The quantity also is very variable; but it was observed to be\r\nconstantly in an inverse ratio to the cutaneous absorption.\r\n\r\nvi. The proportions of the two gases vary very much, and sometimes\r\nthe exhaled gas consists almost entirely of azote: in other instances\r\nthe predominance of carbonic acid is so great that it appears to be\r\nthe only product.—_Med. Rep._, N. S. v. 75.\r\n\r\n17. _Effects of Galvanism in Cases of Asphyxia by submersion_.—M.\r\nLeroy d’Etioles has addressed a letter to the Académie de Médecine,\r\nin reply to an assertion made by M. Thillaye respecting the inutility\r\nof galvanism in cases of asphyxia. The former says, that when a\r\nshort and fine needle is inserted in the sides of the body between\r\nthe eighth and ninth ribs so as to come in contact with [p231] the\r\nattachment of the diaphragm, and then the current of electricity from\r\n25 or 30 pair of inch plates passed through them, that the diaphragm\r\nimmediately contracts, and an inspiration is effected. Upon breaking\r\nthe communication, and again completing it, a second inspiration is\r\noccasioned, and by continuing these means, a regular respiration\r\nmay ultimately be occasioned. This power thus applied has always\r\nsucceeded with him in experiments on drowned animals.—_Bull. Univ._,\r\nC. xi. 213.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. _Recovery from Drowning_.—M. Bourgeois had occasion accidentally\r\nto give assistance in a case where, after a person had been twenty\r\nminutes under water, he was taken out, and by a very common but\r\nserious mistake, carried with his head downwards. The usual means\r\nwere tried unremittingly, but unsuccessfully, for a whole hour, but\r\nat the end of that time a little blood flowed from a vein that had\r\nbeen opened, and a ligature being placed on the arm, ten ounces of\r\nblood were withdrawn: the circulation and respiration were then\r\ngradually re-established, horrible convulsions, and a frightful state\r\nof tetanus coming on at the same time; copious bleeding was again\r\neffected, after which a propensity to sleep came on: a third bleeding\r\nthe following morning was followed by the recovery of the patient.\r\nHence M. Bourgeois concludes that the means of recovering a drowned\r\nperson should never be abandoned until the decomposition of the body\r\nhas commenced.—_Bull. Univ._, C. xi. 213.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. _Preservation of Cantharides_.—It is stated by M. Farines that\r\nthe active part of cantharides exists only in the soft organs of the\r\ninsect; that these are the parts which are attacked by a species of\r\nacarus, and that in this way the cantharides are injured. Camphor\r\nhas no power of preventing the attacks of the acarus; but M. Farines\r\nbelieves that pyroligneous acid will be found effectual, and proposes\r\nto prepare cantharides with it, and even to kill them at the time\r\nwhen they are collected by submersion in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. _Chloride of Lime in cases of Burns_.—The good effect of chloride\r\nof lime in cases of burns is confirmed by the experience of M.\r\nLisfranc. He has applied it in many cases of that kind, sometimes\r\nimmediately after the accident, sometimes after the application of\r\nemollient cataplasms. Lint is moistened in a solution more or less\r\nstrong of chloride of lime, and then applied to the place, being\r\ncovered over with waxed cloth. The cure has been singularly hastened\r\nunder its influence and in one case where almost the whole of the\r\nlower limbs, the arms and face, had been burnt, the use of the\r\nchloride recovered the patient from the stupor into which he had\r\nfallen at the end of four days, and a perfect recovery was effected\r\ntwo months after the accident.—_Bull. Univ_., C. xi. 77. [p232]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. _Cure of Nasal Polypi_.—Dr. Primus of Babenhausen asserts, that\r\nthe saffronised tincture of opium (of the Prussian Pharmacopœia)\r\npossesses the property of gradually destroying nasal polypi when\r\napplied to them. Certain cures, which have been thus effected, have\r\nalready been published, and a striking one occurred in January, 1826.\r\nA man, 46 years of age, had one in each nostril. The tincture was\r\napplied several times a day to the bases of the polypi, by means of a\r\nsmall hair-brush or lint roll. In eight days the tumours had assumed\r\na paler appearance, and lost a little in volume; a serous secretion\r\nfrom the nose, which had existed for a long time, was diminished, and\r\nthe pituitary membrane had acquired a more lively tint, as if in a\r\nsub-inflammatory state. The application was continued, the tumours\r\ncontinued to decrease, and at the end of three weeks had entirely\r\ndisappeared.—_Mediz. Chirurg. Zeitung_, 1826, p. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. _Bite of the Viper_.—M. Jacopo Sacchi, of Barzio in Valsasina,\r\nhaving had occasion to take charge of some cases in which injury had\r\nbeen inflicted by the bite of a viper (Coluber Berus), transferred\r\nhis observations upon them into the hands of Professor Paletta. From\r\nthese it appears that ammonia, recommended by Dr. Mangili, in 1813,\r\nalthough an excellent remedy in many cases, is by no means sufficient\r\nin all, but must occasionally be seconded by every possible means.\r\nAlthough sometimes nature alone has power sufficient to overcome\r\nthe bite of a viper, yet, at other times, the injury is so great\r\nand sudden as to resemble the effects of hydrocyanic acid. In these\r\ncases he recommends that the patient should be put into a hot bed\r\ncovered with woollen clothes, and the most powerful sudorifics with\r\nsome tonics administered internally. Friction should be applied all\r\nover the body, and at the same time the wounds are to be enlarged,\r\ncupping-glasses applied, and tow, dipped in ammonia, applied to the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. _Experiments on the Poison of the Viper_.—M. Desaulx confirms\r\nthe fact that dogs can swallow with impunity even large quantities\r\nof the poison of vipers. He observed also that when this poison\r\nwas withdrawn from the vesicles it soon lost in power, and\r\nafter a certain time became inert: a portion ten days old being\r\nintroduced into a fresh wound of a living animal, only caused slight\r\ntumefaction on the part. Mangili, on the contrary, found it, when\r\nhermetically sealed up, to retain its virulence for many months. The\r\nspecies of viper from which M. Desaulx obtained his poison is not\r\nmentioned.—_Bull. Univ._ C. xi. 142.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. _Destruction of Moles_.—The following method of destroying moles\r\nis asserted, by the Count de Boisseulh, to be excellent. Grounds much\r\ninfested by these animals have been perfectly freed from them by\r\nmeans of it. A number of worms must be procured, killed, and powdered\r\nwith pulverised vomica-nut; the whole is to [p233] be mixed and left\r\nfor twenty-four hours. The mole-tracks are then to be opened, and two\r\nor three of these worms placed in each hole. If the meadow is large,\r\nthey cannot be placed in every hole; but by multiplying them as much\r\nas possible, a good result is sure to be obtained.—_Ann. de Agricul.\r\nde la Charente_.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. _On growing Salad-herbs at Sea_.—On long sea-voyages, whatever\r\nesculent roots, or fruit, or whatever vegetable essences may be\r\nstowed in the steward’s stores, whether for the use of the officers\r\nor crew, nothing can be a greater treat to the former, especially\r\nwithin the tropics, than a dish of fresh salubrious salad-herbs. The\r\nwant of such an addition to the ordinary fare on board a ship has\r\noften been a cause of disease, and misfortune, and even death!—it\r\nis needless, therefore, to insist on the usefulness, or to state\r\nthe antiscorbutic, and consequently sanatory qualities, of fresh\r\nvegetables in such situations; and however limited the means to\r\nsupply such a want as is described below, yet, as it may be highly\r\nuseful to convalescents, and in individual cases, the publication may\r\nnot be deemed altogether valueless.\r\n\r\nProvide one, two, or three deal boards, made of well-seasoned inch\r\nstuff, sixteen inches square, with a ledge all round, rising one\r\ninch above the smooth surface of the board; and as it is intended to\r\nhold water, the ledges must be closely and neatly fitted: at each\r\ncorner a nail, or small hook, should be placed, with strings tied\r\ninto a loop above, by which the board may be slung in the necessary\r\nhorizontal position; a thin covering-board, made of the same material\r\nand dimensions, is also necessary, and which will serve for all the\r\nboards.\r\n\r\nPieces of the _thickest_ flannel must be had for each board, cut so\r\nas to fit exactly within the ledges. These flannels require to be\r\nwell soaked, and repeatedly washed in boiling water, before they can\r\nbe used, to discharge from them whatever is pernicious to vegetation\r\nas they come from the manufacturer’s hands.\r\n\r\nThe board and flannel thus prepared, dip the flannel in water, and\r\nplace on the boards; sow the seeds pretty thick and regularly;\r\nsprinkle them lightly with the hand, till all are moistened and the\r\nflannel completely saturated; in which state it should always be kept\r\nduring the growth of the plants. Too much water floats the seeds when\r\nfirst put on, and are thereby shifted from their places by the motion\r\nof the ship. The cover-board must now be put on, and the whole hung\r\nup in its place. The use of this board is to assist the vegetation of\r\nthe seeds, which it will do sufficiently in the course of twenty-four\r\nhours; after which it may be laid aside.\r\n\r\nThe board must be frequently examined, and when the moisture thereon\r\nis diminished by evaporation, or imbibed by the crop, a supply must\r\nbe given, just enough to keep the flannel in the proper saturated\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIn six or seven days the crop will be (if the weather has been\r\nfavourable) two inches high,—it is then fit for use. The produce\r\n[p234] of one board yields about as much as will fill a middle-sized\r\nsalad-bowl, and when dressed up with the usual condiments of onion,\r\nsalt, vinegar, and oil, a most agreeable salad will be composed, and\r\na most acceptable treat to the guests at the captain’s table.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the board, as well as the flannel, be scalded,\r\nwell washed, and dried in the sun, before it can be used again;—and\r\nas one board yields one crop per week, two, or even three boards may\r\nbe used at the same time, in order to secure a regular supply. Larger\r\nboards are not so convenient, because they can only be hung in some\r\nby-corner of a cabin, quarter-gallery, or state-room, where they may\r\nnot only be out of the way, but out of the sun and currents of air.\r\n\r\nThe herbs suitable to be raised in this way are, radish, mustard, and\r\ncommon garden-cress. The two first answer best within the tropics;\r\nthe last does not, being too delicate and diminutive;—but this does\r\nvery well when the ship is no nearer the equator than thirty degrees\r\nof latitude. One peck of radish, another of mustard, and two quarts\r\nof cress, will be sufficient for an India and China voyage,—a supply\r\nof which may be had in China. I. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. _Chinese Method of fattening Fish_.—The Chinese are celebrated\r\nfor their commercial acumen, indefatigable industry, and natural\r\nadroitness,—in making the most of every gift of nature bestowed\r\non their fertile country. Useful as well as ornamental vegetables\r\nengross their every care; and animals which are the most profitably\r\nreared, and which yield the greatest quantity of rich and savoury\r\nfood, are preferred by them for supplying their larders and stews.\r\nTheir _hortus dietetica_ would form a considerable list; and\r\nthough they do not use such a variety of butcher’s meat and fowl\r\nas Europeans do, yet in the articles of pork, geese, and ducks,\r\nthey surpass, in the use of fish they equal, us, and in their\r\ndomestication and management of them they excel all other nations.\r\n\r\nA few observations on their _piscinas_, or fish-stews, is the design\r\nof this paper; not merely as an historical description, but as an\r\nobject for imitation in this or any other country.\r\n\r\nFor twenty or thirty miles round Canton, and as far as the eye can\r\nreach on each side of the river on which that city stands, the\r\ngeneral face of the country appears nearly a level plain, with but\r\nlittle undulation of surface. The level is, however, richly studded\r\nwith beautiful hills, which diversify the landscape, and seem to rise\r\nout of the plain so abruptly, that they form the most picturesque\r\nfeatures, united with the most pleasing combinations. The soil of\r\nthe plain consists of a pure alluvial earth of great fertility and\r\ndepth, and very retentive of water; which, by the by, is a proof\r\nthat, notwithstanding their claim to high chronological antiquity,\r\nthe waters of the deluge remained much longer (perhaps for ages) on\r\nthis portion of the continent of Asia, than it did in the interior:\r\nand the circumstance of many of their hills being cultivated to\r\nthe [p235] very top, their numerous water-plants, and their almost\r\namphibious habits as to their domiciles, are still further proofs\r\nthat the country was, once, more of an aquaium than it now is.\r\nHence the facility of making canals, which are their high-roads (as\r\nwheel-carriages, and beasts of draught, are too expensive appendages,\r\nfor the systematic economy of the celestial empire!) and hence the\r\nease with which a pond may be made in any otherwise useless corner.\r\nSuch tanks, or ponds, are generally met with in market-garden\r\ngrounds, where they serve the double purpose of a reservoir, and a\r\nstew for rearing and fattening fish.\r\n\r\nWhen a pond is made for this purpose, and filled with water, the\r\nowner goes to market, and buys as many young store-fish as his pond\r\ncan conveniently hold; this he can easily do, as almost all their\r\nfish are brought to market alive. Placed in the stew, they are\r\nregularly fed morning and evening, or as often as the feeder finds it\r\nnecessary; their food is chiefly boiled rice, to which is added, the\r\nblood of any animals they may kill, wash from their stewing-pots and\r\ndishes, &c., indeed any animal offal or vegetable matter which the\r\nfish will eat. It is said, they also use some oleaceous medicament\r\nin the food, to make the fish more voracious, in order to accelerate\r\ntheir fattening; but of this the writer could obtain no authentic\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nFish so fed and treated, advance in size rapidly, though not to any\r\ngreat weight; as the kind (a species of perch) which came under\r\nobservation, never arrive at much more than a pound avoirdupois; but\r\nfrom the length of three or four inches, when first put in, they grow\r\nto eight or nine in a few months, and are then marketable. Drafts\r\nfrom the pond are then occasionally made; the largest are first taken\r\noff, and conveyed in large shallow tubs of water to market: if sold,\r\nwell; if not, they are brought back and replaced in the stew, until\r\nthey can be disposed of.\r\n\r\nThis business of fish-feeding is so managed that the stock are\r\nall fattened off about the time the water is most wanted for the\r\ngarden-crops. The pond is then cleaned out, the mud carefully saved,\r\nor spread as manure,—again filled with water, stocked with young fry,\r\nand fed as before.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent Chinaman, from whom the writer had the above detail,\r\nand who showed him as much of the process as could be seen during a\r\nresidence of three months, declared as his belief, that a spot of\r\nground, containing from twenty to thirty square yards, would yield a\r\ngreater annual profit as a stew, than it would in any other way to\r\nwhich it could possibly be applied.\r\n\r\nThat fish may be tamed, suffer themselves to be caressed, and even\r\nraised out of their natural element by the hand, has been long known\r\nto naturalists; witness the famous old carp formerly in the pond\r\nof some religious house at Chantilly, in France, with many other\r\ninstances on record. But it is probable no people has carried the art\r\nof stew-feeding fish, and practising it as a profitable concern, to\r\nsuch lengths, as is done by the Chinese at this day. I. M.

To operate upon the shoulders,\r\nthe common back-collar is applied, and to hold back the head, a\r\nriband is brought over the forehead and fastened to the collar.\r\n\r\nWhile these instruments are kept on, the figure looks straight,\r\nthough stiff and constrained; but the moment they are taken off,\r\nboth the head and the shoulders fall more forward, than before\r\ntheir application. Many examples of the bad effect of artificially\r\nsupporting the head might be offered. The following, although\r\nobserved in the figure of a horse, is very demonstrative. When the\r\nrein (called the bearing-rein), by which the head of a carriage-horse\r\nis reared up, with the intention of giving him a showy figure, is\r\nloosened, the head immediately falls forward, and the neck, instead\r\nof preserving the fine arch that is so much admired, droops between\r\nthe shoulders. Looking to this effect, we should at first be inclined\r\nto condemn the practice followed by horse-dealers, of reining up\r\nthe head of a young horse in the stable, by means of the apparatus\r\ncalled a dumb-jockey. But on examining into this mode of fixing\r\nthe head, it will be found to operate on a different principle from\r\nthe bearing-rein. Instead of a [p238] simple bit, such as the horse\r\nin harness can lean his head upon, without suffering pain, a bit,\r\ncalculated to tease and fret, is put into the young horse’s mouth.\r\nTo relieve himself from the irritation produced by this, and which\r\nis increased by the constant pull of the elastic piece of iron to\r\nwhich the rein is fastened, he curls up his neck, and thus brings\r\nall the muscles of the back of the neck into strong action, instead\r\nof allowing their power to be superseded by the artificial support\r\nafforded by the bearing-rein to the horse in harness[38].\r\n\r\nMany different contrivances, but all acting nearly on the same\r\nprinciple as the _bearing-rein_, have been proposed as means for\r\nobliging a girl to keep her head erect.\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is one mode which, to a person ignorant of anatomy, seems to be\r\nparticularly well adapted for this purpose; but it is, in fact, more\r\nobjectionable than the plan of tying the head back with a riband. A\r\npiece of lead, of some pounds weight, [p239] is slung over the back\r\nin such a way that it must be supported by a riband put around the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAlthough this contrivance prevents the head for a time from falling\r\nforwards, its bad effects may be demonstrated. When the weight is on,\r\nthe muscles of the back of the spine are passive, while those on the\r\nfore-part of the neck are necessarily brought into action to prevent\r\nthe head from being pulled too far back: this is easily proved; for\r\nif we put the fingers on the sternal portions of the sterno-cleido\r\nmuscle, which, with the small muscles on the fore-part of the throat,\r\npull the head forwards, we shall feel them tense and in action. The\r\nincreased activity of the muscles on the fore part, and the passive\r\ncondition of those of the back, may be further exemplified by raising\r\nthe weight when the girl is not aware of our doing so; the head will\r\nthen be immediately poked forwards.\r\n\r\nWe have many opportunities of observing the incorrectness of the\r\nprinciple on which all similar plans for the cure of a stoop have\r\nbeen founded. For instance, porters who carry burthens on the back,\r\nby the assistance of a band round the forehead, always stoop; while\r\nthose who carry baskets before them suspended by a band round the\r\nback of the neck, are peculiarly erect. But the most remarkable\r\nexample of the effect of the head being pulled back by a weight hung\r\nbehind, is the condition of the women who carry salt in the streets\r\nof Edinburgh, for they may be recognised as much by their miserable\r\nSardonic grin, which is caused by the constant excitement of the\r\nplatysma myoides muscle, as by their stoop.\r\n\r\nVery annoying and even distressing consequences may ensue from any\r\nsystem of treatment where a constant resistance to the muscles of\r\nthe fore-part of the neck is kept up. A gentleman had for many\r\nyears worn one of the collars invented by Mr. Chesher; after some\r\ntime, the muscles of the back became so weak, as to be incapable\r\nof supporting the column, while those on the fore-part of the neck\r\nwere so disproportionately increased in strength, by the constant\r\nresistance opposed to them by the strap passing from the suspending\r\nrod under the chin, that whenever the strap was loosened, the chin\r\nwas forcibly drawn towards the chest. As the muscles of the back part\r\nof the neck did not offer any counteracting resistance, the [p240]\r\nwindpipe was now pressed down, or almost doubled itself. As soon as\r\nthis took place (and it was almost immediate on the attempt to sit\r\nup without the collar,) the patient was seized with such a sense of\r\nsuffocation, as to be obliged to throw himself on his back. As he was\r\nable to breathe with ease as he lay on his back, his advisers were\r\nled to believe that it was the weight of the head which pressed down\r\nthe windpipe. To counteract this pressure, various contrivances had\r\nbeen proposed to support the head. Indeed, the patient himself was\r\nso convinced, from what he had heard, that it was the weight of the\r\nhead which pressed down the windpipe, and so alarmed had he become\r\nfrom the certainty of having a fit of suffocation when the head was\r\nleft unsupported, that there was much difficulty in persuading him\r\nto believe that if the head could be made _heavier_, the sense of\r\nsuffocation would be relieved. He was at length induced, although\r\nwith great dread of the consequence, to allow about fourteen pounds\r\nof shot to be placed on the top of his head. He was very much\r\nalarmed, but it was highly gratifying to witness his surprise and\r\npleasure in finding that, instead of his head being weighed down, he\r\ncould support it, and could breathe with ease while in the upright\r\nposture. The following is the principle on which this plan was\r\nproposed:—the muscles of the back part of the neck had been brought\r\ninto such a state, that their ordinary stimulus was not sufficient\r\nto excite them to the action necessary to counteract the efforts\r\nof those on the fore-part of the neck, which had been evidently\r\nincreased in strength. The placing a weight on a certain spot on the\r\nhead formed an additional stimulus to the muscles of the back part\r\nof the neck; a fact which the reader may prove by an experiment on\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBy proceeding on this principle, by combining a variety of exercises,\r\nand by gradually diminishing the weight carried on the head, this\r\ngentleman was soon able to walk and sit in a state of great comfort,\r\nwithout being obliged to use any artificial support.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that the neck-collars support almost the whole\r\nweight of the head and shoulders by the strap which passes under\r\nthe chin. It must also have been observed, that the wearer very\r\nfrequently pushes down the head against the [p241] chin strap. In\r\nthis way, the muscles on the fore-part necessarily become stronger,\r\nwhile those of the back, being deprived of their natural stimulus to\r\naction, in consequence of the rod superseding their office, become\r\ndiminished in power. Even were there no change in the degree of\r\nstrength in the muscles on the fore-part, the head would naturally\r\nfall, if the support afforded by the chin strap were removed; but as\r\nthese muscles are increased in power, while those of the back are\r\ndiminished, the head must not only fall, but even be pulled down.\r\n\r\nHowever, although the collars and the lead weight, as they are\r\ngenerally used, are not only inefficacious; but even hurtful,\r\nthey may occasionally be useful in keeping the head in a certain\r\nposition, after it has been brought to it by such exercises as tend\r\nto strengthen those muscles of the back which support the shoulders\r\nand head. But the opinions commonly entertained, as to the means of\r\ncounteracting an habitual stoop, are so erroneous, that even the\r\nposition of a tailor sitting on his shopboard is better than the\r\nplans generally recommended. This at first appears ridiculous; but\r\nthe manner a tailor holds his body when he walks, proves that there\r\nis something in his habits which tends to the correction of a stoop;\r\nfor he is quite a caricature of a strutting erect figure, especially\r\nin the way he bends in his loins and carries his head.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the tailor’s gait proceeds, in a certain degree,\r\nfrom the bent position in which he sits: but this explanation is not\r\nat first satisfactory, since it may be observed that other tradesmen,\r\nwho also stoop while at work, generally have their head inclined\r\nforwards, and have also a distinct and habitual bend in the neck;\r\nsuch, especially, is the condition of persons who sit at a table and\r\nstoop forwards, as watchmakers, engravers, &c. It is not difficult\r\nto explain the cause of the difference, and the inquiry will assist\r\nin directing us to the principles which we ought to recollect in our\r\noperations upon the spine.\r\n\r\nIn the sitting position of the tailor, the head hangs so low, and\r\nso complete an arch is formed between it and the pelvis, that the\r\nmuscles of the spine are called into strong action to support the\r\nhead; the necessary consequence of this is, that these muscles become\r\neven unnaturally strong, or at least so strong as to predominate\r\nover those by which the spine is [p242] pulled forward. But the\r\nbent position is not the only cause of increase in the strength of\r\nthe muscles, for it depends also on the exercise given by frequently\r\njerking the head backwards. In those who stoop from the middle of\r\nthe body, as in writing or working at a table, the muscles of the\r\nspine are not called into action; for, while the head is in this\r\nposition, it rests or is supported by the ligament of the neck.\r\nThe ligament, being thus kept constantly on the stretch, becomes\r\nlengthened, instead of being made more contractile, as muscles would\r\nbe; and hence the stoop is increased. When this is combined with the\r\nconsequences of the want of muscular action, the deeper ligaments,\r\nwhich bind the upper vertebræ, gradually yield; if the operation of\r\nthese causes continues for a certain time, the bones and cartilages\r\nthemselves become altered in shape, and consequently an almost\r\nirremediable stoop is produced[39].\r\n\r\nThis view derives confirmation, from what may be observed in the\r\nshape of the tailors in some parts of Germany, who, instead of having\r\nthe erect figures of London tailors, are quite bent. On inquiring\r\ninto the cause, we find that, instead of sitting as tailors do in\r\nthis country, a hole is cut in the table, and a seat is placed within\r\nit; so that their position, while working, becomes nearly the same as\r\nthat of persons who stoop while sitting at a table.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be objected, that labourers, and especially the\r\nvine-dressers in France, are remarkable for the complete arch which\r\ntheir body forms, although they bend while at work as much as the\r\ntailor does. This may also be explained; for in the labourer the bend\r\nis produced by the pelvis rolling on the head of the thigh bones,\r\nwhile in a person sitting as a tailor the pelvis continues nearly\r\nfixed, and the bend is in the vertebræ on the pelvis.\r\n\r\nThe erect figure of the Turk perhaps comes from the manner of sitting\r\nwhich is common among Eastern nations; but the heavy turban, and the\r\nspice box slung from the back of the neck, may account in a great\r\nmeasure for the fine figures of the Turkish Jews who frequent the\r\nstreets of London. [p243]\r\n\r\nWe may even take the shoemaker as an example of the effect of a\r\nparticular manner of sitting, and of frequently using the muscles\r\nof the shoulders. He is also a little in caricature, but he carries\r\nhimself better than the tailor, and the cause is obvious. The\r\ntailor’s figure is very erect, but the right shoulder is generally\r\na little higher or larger than the left, from the constant exercise\r\ngiven to the right arm, while the left rests upon the knee: this\r\ninequality of the shoulders is not observed in the shoemaker, because\r\nhe not only uses both arms equally, but the muscles by which the\r\nscapulæ are supported, become so strong by the habit of jerking back\r\nhis elbows while he works, that his shoulders always appear more\r\nbraced back than those of any other class of persons: indeed, so\r\ncharacteristic are the figures of tailors and shoemakers, that they\r\nmay be easily distinguished in a crowd.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances are mentioned, as they afford familiar examples\r\nof the principles on which we ought to proceed, in endeavouring\r\nto correct deformities; but it would be ridiculous to propose the\r\nposition either of the tailor or of the shoemaker, as the best\r\nadapted to correct a stoop or falling forward of the shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations apply also to the contrivances usually\r\nemployed to keep the shoulders back, and particularly to the question\r\nof the propriety of using the common back-collar. The effect which\r\nthis instrument produces in ordinary cases may be easily comprehended\r\nby the following diagram.\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\n[p244]\r\n\r\nThe part of the back formed by the ribs is not a flat, but rather a\r\nround surface; and as the shoulder-blades rest on this, they would\r\nfall forwards were they not prevented by the collar-bones; but as\r\nthese bones are united to the breast-bone by a moveable joint, and\r\nas the weight of the arms operates principally on the anterior\r\nangles of the scapulæ, both the collar-bones and the shoulders would\r\nfall forwards, were it not for the action of several strong muscles\r\nwhich pass from the spine to the scapulæ. But these muscles may be\r\ndestroyed by any contrivance which supersedes their use. For example,\r\nlet A A be the shoulder-blades, and B B the muscles which support\r\nthem. If the scapulæ be brought close to the spine by the straps\r\nof the collar, and kept constantly so, there can be no use for the\r\nmuscles B B. They must consequently waste and become nearly useless,\r\nwhile those on the fore-part of the chest, being excited to resist\r\nthe straps, will become increased in power; and hence, when the\r\ncollar is taken off, not only will the shoulders fall forward as in a\r\ndelicate person, but the muscles on the fore-part of the chest will\r\npredominate over those by which the scapulæ should be held back, and\r\n_pull_ the shoulders forwards.\r\n\r\nThe spine and the ribs are occasionally bent so as to have some\r\nresemblance to the back of a spoon. In such cases, the shoulders\r\nnot only appear high and round, but the lower angles of the scapulæ\r\nproject in an extraordinary manner, because the upper and anterior\r\nangle is not only unsupported by the ribs, but is dragged forwards\r\nby the clavicles which are carried in the same direction with the\r\nsternum. When this is to a considerable extent, it constitutes\r\nthe _contracted chest_ or the _chicken breast_. This, in a slight\r\ndegree, is common in London, and especially among young lads; it\r\nmay be discovered by the coat having the appearance of being more\r\nworn opposite the lower angle of the scapula than at any other part.\r\nSuch a condition of the chest can only be completely remedied by\r\nappropriate exercises; but a collar is here necessary for a time, to\r\nkeep the bones in the improved condition into which they are brought\r\nby the exercises.\r\n\r\nThese arguments will probably appear sufficiently well founded to\r\nprove that a girl, under ordinary circumstances, [p245] cannot hold\r\nher head or shoulders back, unless the muscles by which they are\r\nnaturally supported are in a proper condition. Various contrivances\r\nhave been proposed to strengthen these muscles. Dumb bells, if\r\nmanaged in a particular manner, are good; skipping, when the arms are\r\nthrown backwards and over the head, is still better; the exercises,\r\ncalled Spanish exercises, performed with two long poles, are also\r\nuseful, but to each of these there may be objections, as they all\r\noperate more or less on the spine or ribs, which, in case of a bad\r\nstoop, are generally affected.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote will, perhaps, set the question of the\r\npropriety of wearing the back collar in a correct point of view. A\r\nsurgeon was consulted by a gentleman, who is now one of our first\r\ntragedians, as to the best mode of correcting a stoop which he had\r\nacquired. The surgeon told him that neither stays nor straps would do\r\nhim any essential good; and that the only method of succeeding was to\r\nrecollect to keep his shoulders braced back by a voluntary effort.\r\nBut the tragedian replied, that this he could not do, as his mind was\r\notherwise occupied. The surgeon then told him that he could give him\r\nno further assistance. Shortly after this conversation, the actor\r\nordered his tailor to make a coat of the finest kerseymere, so as to\r\nfit him very tightly, when his shoulders were thrown back. Whenever\r\nhis shoulders fell forward he was reminded by a pinch under the arms,\r\nthat his coat cost him six guineas, and that it was made of very\r\nfragile materials; being thus forced, for the sake of his fine coat,\r\nto keep his shoulders back, he soon cured himself of the stoop. The\r\nsurgeon was much obliged to him for the hint, and afterwards, when\r\nconsulted whether young ladies should wear shoulder straps, permitted\r\nthem, on condition that they were made of fine muslin, or valuable\r\nsilk, for tearing which there should be a forfeit.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into the manner a girl should sit may appear trifling\r\nto those who have not been in the habit of seeing many cases of\r\ndistortion of the spine, but it is intimately connected with the\r\npresent subject, and is really of considerable importance. The\r\nquestion has been disputed; one party insisting that girls should\r\nalways sit erect, while others are advocates for a lounging position.\r\nIt is not difficult to show that both are [p246] wrong;—when a\r\ndelicately formed girl is supposed to be sitting erect, she is\r\ngenerally sitting crooked: to a superficial observer she may appear\r\nquite straight; but any one who will sit on a music stool, and\r\nendeavour to keep his body in a perpendicular line for ten minutes,\r\nwill be convinced that it is difficult for even a strong man to sit\r\nas long as a delicate girl is expected to do, without allowing the\r\nspine to sink to one side or to fall forwards.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to sit erect beyond a certain time is injurious, for\r\nalthough bending the spine occasionally is useful rather than\r\nhurtful, yet when it is done involuntarily, and when the bend is\r\nattempted to be concealed by an endeavour to keep the head straight,\r\nthere is danger of the spine becoming twisted. Indeed, a double curve\r\nis generally the consequence; there is first a bend to one side, to\r\ngive ease to the fatigued muscles; and then, to conceal this, there\r\nis a second curve that is necessarily accompanied by a slight twist\r\nin the vertical line of the whole column.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to allow children to sit in a crooked or lounging\r\nposition seems to have been founded on the idea that all the muscles\r\nare more relaxed in this way than even when the child lies at full\r\nlength on its back. This notion is certainly incorrect, and such a\r\nmode of sitting is injurious; for even were the muscles more relaxed\r\nby it, the bones and ligaments acquire such a shape as necessarily\r\nproduces distortion.\r\n\r\nIt may naturally be asked how a girl should sit, since it would\r\nappear, that whether she is in an erect or stooping posture, she is\r\nequally in danger of becoming crooked. As sitting, in the manner\r\ngenerally recommended, affords little or no support to one who is\r\nweak, the safest answer would be, that a delicate girl should not sit\r\nfor even more than five or ten minutes without having some support\r\nto her back, and when she is fatigued, that she should lie down or\r\nrecline on a couch. But as it would be very annoying to a girl not to\r\nbe allowed to sit up except for so short a time, and as a couch is\r\nnot always at hand, we must endeavour to show how a delicate girl may\r\nremain in an upright posture, for a reasonable time without incurring\r\nany risk of becoming crooked. This leads to an inquiry into the\r\nmerits of the chairs which are at present generally used by children.\r\n[p247]\r\n\r\nYoung ladies are often obliged, while at their music lessons, to\r\nsit upon those chairs, which have high backs, long legs, and small\r\nseats. These chairs are said to have been invented by a very eminent\r\nsurgeon, and are intended, either to prevent distortion, by some\r\nsupposed operation on the spine, or as the most effectual means of\r\nsupporting the body. It is difficult to imagine how a chair of this\r\ndescription can effect the first purpose; and to discover how far it\r\nis calculated for the second, the reader should make the experiment\r\non a chair of the same proportion to his figure, as the chair in\r\nquestion is to that of a little girl. He will find that if the seat\r\nor surface on which he rests is small in proportion to his body, the\r\nchest will, after a time, either fall forward or to one side, unless\r\nhe exert himself to a degree that is very fatiguing. Indeed, if the\r\nseat be at the same time so high, that the feet do not rest fairly\r\non the ground, but dangle under the chair, a forward position of the\r\nhead is almost necessary to preserve the balance of the figure[40].\r\n\r\nThe objections to such chairs have been met with the assertion, that\r\ngirls feel remarkably comfortable in them. This is no argument in\r\nfavour of their use, for it is not uncommon for a girl who has seven\r\nor eight pounds of iron strapped upon her body and next to her skin,\r\nto say the machine annoys her so little, that she does not care how\r\nlong she wears it.\r\n\r\nBut whether this chair is agreeable or not, it is easy to show that\r\nit is not calculated to give much proper support to the body, and\r\nthat it is almost impossible for a delicate girl to sit long in a\r\nnatural or easy position upon it.\r\n\r\nIt may be allowed, that the chair which we consider the most\r\ncomfortable, that is, the chair which affords the most support to\r\nthe body, should, if made in proper proportions, be the best for a\r\ndelicate girl. In such a chair, the _seat_ should be scarcely higher\r\nthan the knees (thus permitting the whole of the foot to rest on\r\nthe floor), and of such a size, that on sitting back, the upper\r\npart of the calves nearly touch it. This form of _seat_ is very\r\ndifferent from that of the chair alluded to, the _back_ of which is\r\nalso equally objectionable, for, instead of being in [p248] some\r\ndegree shaped to the natural curves of the spine, it is made nearly\r\nstraight, and projects so as to push the head forwards. A delicate\r\ngirl should always sit so as to rest against the back of the chair,\r\nand, if the lower part of her spine is weak, a small cushion will\r\nafford great relief. As it is quite a mistake to suppose that the\r\nshoulders, if raised in any other way than by the action of the\r\nmuscles, or by the curvature of the spine and ribs, will continue\r\nhigh, there is no real objection to a girl who is delicate being\r\nsupported by an arm-chair; for, by occasionally resting on the\r\nelbows, a considerable weight is taken off from that part of the\r\nspine which is the most likely to yield.\r\n\r\nThese observations refer only to the manner in which delicate girls,\r\nwhose spines are still straight, should sit: when the spine is\r\nactually distorted, it will be necessary to use other means.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [37] For this, and some other communications upon the same\r\n subject, we are chiefly indebted to our much-lamented friend and\r\n correspondent, the late Mr. Shaw, Surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital.\r\n\r\n [38] When the Russians wish to give a horse high action in trotting,\r\n they accustom him, while young, to wear heavy shoes on the fore\r\n feet. The resistance to be overcome necessarily increases the\r\n strength of certain muscles; and hence, when shoes of the common\r\n size are put on, the horse lifts his feet higher than one which has\r\n not been subjected to this discipline. Some opera dancers practise\r\n with lead weights on.\r\n\r\n [39] Elderly persons may recollect how often the girls who worked\r\n at _tambouring_ were crooked: the present fashionable amusement of\r\n embroidering seems to have, in some instances, the same effect.\r\n\r\n [40] It must be almost unnecessary to remind the reader, that if the\r\n knees are bent in standing or walking, there is a curve in the spine\r\n at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Critique on the Aplanatic Object-Glasses, for diverging Rays, of_\r\n Vincent Chevalier, ainé et fils. _By_ C. R. Goring, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curiosity of many will doubtless be excited, as to what our\r\nneighbours, the French, ever foremost in the pursuit of glory,\r\nboth in arts and arms, have been doing in the affair of achromatic\r\nobject-glasses for microscopes. With the highest satisfaction I find\r\nmyself enabled to state, that Messieurs Chevalier, (ainé et fils,)\r\nNo. 69, Quai de l’Horloge, Paris, have rivalled our own artists, in\r\nthis branch of the manufacture of optical instruments.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Lister, actuated by a most laudable zeal for the prosecution\r\nand advancement of optical science, as it concerns microscopes,\r\ncaused me to order for him one of Messrs. Chevalier’s instruments,\r\n_in Mr. W. Tulley’s name_; for, as Mr. L. wished that Messrs. C.’s\r\npretensions should be fairly and thoroughly scrutinized, it was but\r\nfair that the latter gentlemen should be stimulated to do their\r\nutmost, by a consideration of the science of their customer. A\r\ncritical examination of the object-glasses of this instrument (for\r\nmaking which every facility was afforded me by Mr. L.), forms the\r\nsubject of the present paper. [p249]\r\n\r\nI here, then, enter upon the discussion of the merits and demerits\r\nof the objectives of the said instrument[41], these being much more\r\nperfected than those of another, of previous make, which I saw in the\r\npossession of Mr. Howship, of Great George-street, Hanover-square,\r\nto whom I received a letter of recommendation from Mr. Spilsbury, of\r\nBall-Haye. To the signal politeness of these gentlemen, in furthering\r\nmy views, I am greatly indebted.\r\n\r\nFour object-glasses accompany Messrs. Chevaliers’ instruments (at\r\nleast those marked _perfectionnés_,) usually rated at the following\r\nfoci: 14 French lines, 10 ditto, 4 and 4: the two latter combine\r\ntogether at will, and give a focus of two lines.\r\n\r\n14.) Focus about 1.42 of an English inch, clear aperture 0.31,\r\noriginal aperture as reduced by a stop, 0.10.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly achromatic with its clear aperture, and may be used\r\nwithout a stop on most transparent objects; requires to be cut off\r\nto 0.23, to give the necessary distinctness for opaque ones.—(When\r\nI speak of the apertures which C.’s lenses will bear, I must be\r\nunderstood, here and elsewhere, only with regard to the _middle of\r\nthe field of view_, or rather that part of it where the distinctness\r\nis greatest[42], for double object-glasses give the central rays only\r\ncorrect, and confuse the oblique ones very much, for which reason,\r\nconjoined with the small apertures they admit of, they were abandoned\r\nby Mr. Tulley, for the triple construction, the true and regular form\r\nfor the microscope.)—There is an excess of spherical aberration in\r\nconvex lenses; neither are the glasses well ground, or centered, or\r\nduly adjusted. The concave of this object-glass is tarnished, and\r\nthere are traces of seediness in the cement, which is, indeed, to be\r\nseen more or less in the whole of them.\r\n\r\n10.) Focus about 0.91, clear aperture 0.23, original stop 0.09.\r\n[p250]\r\n\r\nThis object-glass is under corrected in point of colour, and wants\r\nto be made longer in the focus to be achromatic. The excess of\r\nuncorrected spherical aberration is in the convex lens; the glasses\r\nare not well ground, centered, or adjusted; the same appearance of\r\ntarnish as in 14; bears its clear aperture for the middle of the\r\nfield on most transparent objects, but must be cut off to 0.2 for\r\nopaque ones.\r\n\r\nBoth of these object-glasses are ineffective upon test objects, from\r\nwant of sufficient power and aperture.\r\n\r\n4.) Focus about 0.43, clear aperture 0.23, original stop 0.09,\r\nperfectly achromatic. The uncorrected spherical aberration is in\r\nthe concave; centering and grinding very fine, but in very bad\r\nadjustment; shows some transparent test-objects pretty well with its\r\nclear aperture, and, cut off to about 0.16, performs well on many\r\nopaque ones.\r\n\r\n2.) Focus about 4.7, clear aperture 0.21, no stop, perfectly\r\nachromatic, surplus of spherical aberration in the concave as\r\nbefore; centering and grinding very fine; adjustment tolerable; in\r\nother respects very similar to 4. This object-glass being adjusted,\r\ndoes more singly on test-objects than any other, and carries an\r\naperture of 0.16 well on opaque bodies, showing the lines on the\r\ndiamond-beetle’s scales strong and well cut out.\r\n\r\nCombination of 4 and 2—(quadruple.)\r\n\r\nI am happy to be able to speak in terms of almost unqualified\r\napprobation of this composition. It, of course, surpasses the\r\nperformance of any single triple-glass, _on those test-objects which\r\nrequire extravagant angles of aperture_. The field also is good all\r\nover; or at least would be, if the glasses were in adjustment, which\r\nis the only drawback upon it. The focus of the combination is only\r\n0.26, yet it performs admirably on transparent test-objects with its\r\nnaked aperture of 0.23, and is very fine on opaque ones with 0.16,\r\nand doubtless would carry 0.2, if the adjustment was duly carried\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nMessrs. C. have, I think, most assuredly here hit upon one of the\r\nvery best _compositions_ for the object-glass of a microscope; all\r\nthe imperfections of double object-glasses, _taken singly_, are here\r\ndone away, while their thinness and agglutination into one mass\r\nallows of their combining together almost as if they were simple\r\nplano-convex lenses, leaving moreover abundance of space for the\r\nillumination of opaque bodies. [p251]\r\n\r\nI must here state, that Messrs. C.’s object-glasses are all stuck\r\ntogether, I believe, with fused gum-mastic, or, perhaps, with very\r\nthick mastic varnish. This practice seems, in theory, to be bad, most\r\nespecially if the curves united together are not of the same radius;\r\nnevertheless, practically speaking, the process of soldering seems\r\nto me to do more good, by the obliteration of two surfaces, and by\r\nkeeping the glasses immovably adjusted, than harm in any other way. I\r\ncannot, in fact, discover any very sensible difference in the optical\r\nperformance of these small achromatics, whether stuck together or\r\nnot. I _fancy_ that they have a little more light and clearness\r\nwhen cemented, (as they certainly should have,) but cannot be very\r\npositive. I hold it as a maxim in practical optics, as in our common\r\nlaw, “de rebus non _apparentibus_ et non existentibus eadem est\r\nratio.”\r\n\r\nI may observe, that Mr. Lister has combined that marked 10, with 4,\r\nand finds the performance proportional to that of 4 and 2.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that Messrs. C., from an apparent ignorance of\r\nthe value of aperture; and perhaps impressed with the too common\r\nand prevalent idea, that, having once obtained distinctness and\r\nachromatism in their object-glasses, every thing else might be\r\naccomplished by a condensation of artificial light, have reduced\r\ntheir apertures to such a degree, as to render their instrument as\r\nineffective upon test-objects as a common compound; for when the\r\nopening of an aplanatic glass is cut off to the same diameter as a\r\ncommon one, it shows _nothing more_, though it will certainly exhibit\r\nobjects far _more satisfactorily_. Upon the apertures of microscopic\r\nlenses their effects entirely depend, as was remarked a long time\r\nago by the great Huygens. An achromatic glass is more valuable than\r\nanother, merely on account of the larger aperture it will bear,\r\nwithout causing aberration, and consequent indistinctness. Those who\r\nare in possession of Messrs. C.’s microscopes should get the stop\r\nbehind the object-glasses turned out, and procure others to be used\r\nad libitum, according to what the goodness of the object-glasses will\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nI feel myself called upon, however, to state, that, since the\r\ncompletion of Mr. L.’s microscope, Messrs. C. _have enlarged the_\r\n[p252] _apertures of their object-glasses to the requisite angle_,\r\nand have moreover _arrived at the true method of adjusting them_, so\r\nthat they are _now_ free from those objections which applied to Mr.\r\nLister’s, and are in all respects unexceptionably finished.\r\n\r\nI know not if any dispute will ever arise hereafter, as to who is\r\nto be considered as _the original maker of effective aplanatic\r\nobject-glasses for microscopes_[43]. It is of very little consequence\r\nin the present instance, for it so happens that Mr. Tulley and\r\nMessrs. Chevalier have been so totally unconnected with each other,\r\nand have worked upon such totally different principles, that it must\r\nbe evident, on the most superficial consideration, that both are\r\nentitled to the honour; nevertheless I apprehend it can be proved\r\nthat Mr. Tulley made an effective one before the Chevaliers, having\r\ncompleted his in March 1824. The date affixed by Chevalier to his\r\nfirst instrument is 1825[44].\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt requires moreover a stretch of complaisance, not to be expected on\r\nthis side the Channel, to be enabled to admit that the best double\r\nobject-glass is (_taken singly_) effective; or that, in consequence,\r\nChevalier made an _effective one until he had enlarged his apertures,\r\nand combined two together_[45], which combination is not to be met\r\nwith in his primitive instruments. Mr. Lister, (to whom the public\r\nis mainly indebted for the present eclaircissement concerning\r\nChevalier’s instrument,) has, by a peculiar method of his own\r\ndiscovery, measured the [p253] curves, thicknesses, and diameter,\r\n&c. of that marked 14, which I here give (unfortunately one of the\r\nleast effective of the set,) however, in all probability, the rest\r\nare constructed on the same principle; the annexed drawing by Mr. L.\r\nwill sufficiently explain itself. Nothing can surpass the beautiful\r\nsimplicity of Chevalier’s, or rather Euler’s, curves, which, it will\r\nbe observed, are all alike[46]. The production of _deep_ achromatics\r\nmust ever be a task of some difficulty, even to those who thoroughly\r\nunderstand their humours and punctilios; and unscientific artists\r\nwill, I think, be much more likely to succeed on the French plan,\r\nthan the English one. Two double object-glasses, by themselves,\r\nare very poor things; but, when combined, perform admirably, and\r\nwill, I believe, (if the three curves are of equal radii,) be far\r\nmore easily executed than one of the triple Tulleian construction.\r\nThe dense flint-glass of Guenard, or Frauenhofer, however, will be\r\nan indispensable requisite, from the nature of the curvatures. A\r\ntriple Tulleian object-glass, and a thin double one of Chevalier,\r\n(a composition first conceived and adopted by Mr. Lister,) form an\r\nexcellent combination, and give a very vivid light, without softness,\r\ndulness, or nebulosity. This, I think, is the extreme number of\r\nglasses which ought to be tolerated. Let it never be forgotten, that\r\n_a really good triple glass will bear an aperture quite sufficient\r\nfor ninety-nine objects out of a hundred_. I myself denounce the\r\npractice of combining glasses together, _in all those cases where\r\nthey are capable of doing their work alone_. I shall always consider\r\nit as a clumsy, bungling, and unworkmanlike method of obtaining a\r\nshort focus, combined [p254] with a large angle of aperture. If a\r\nman aims at perfection, and wishes to distinguish himself in this\r\nbranch of optics, let it be done by working perfect triple glasses of\r\n0.2 and 0.3 inch focus, with 0.1 and 0.15 of perfect aperture, like\r\nthose of Mr. W. Tulley and Mr. Dollond, or deeper still, if he is\r\nable; and it is with the most cordial satisfaction that I am enabled\r\nto inform my readers, that Messrs. Chevalier (duly appreciating the\r\nregular triple construction as the true form for the microscope) have\r\napplied themselves diligently to the manufacture of this species\r\nof objective, from which they have already had excellent results.\r\nIt is a fundamental principle, that all superfluous refractions\r\nand reflections are to be avoided in the construction of optical\r\ninstruments. As a radical reformer of microscopes, I can tolerate\r\nno abuses in them, or show any quarter to their abettors. Messrs.\r\nChevalier have also undertaken the manufacture of achromatic and\r\ncatadioptric microscopes, after the fashion of those made by\r\nProfessor Amici, of Modena, which were so much and so justly admired\r\nby the cognoscenti of this country.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for me to observe, that though two double-cemented\r\nobject-glasses form the most perfect _combination_ from the fewness\r\nof their surfaces, and consequent brightness of their image, yet a\r\nfusion between the Tulleian and Eulerian constructions seems to be\r\nthe _most convenient_ for general use; by this, of course, I mean\r\na triple glass with a double one, to apply before it occasionally,\r\nà la Lister. Mr. Dollond and Messrs. C. have demonstrated that two\r\nobject-glasses _may be combined with the best effect, which are both\r\ngood, and work well separately_; but Mr. Tulley has constructed a\r\ndouble one, which, useless by itself, when applied over a triple one,\r\n(made to act singly,) corrects that excess of spherical aberration\r\nin the concave lens, (by its own excess in the convex,) which, when\r\nthe aperture is large, is the eternal vice of all the best single and\r\ncompound object-glasses for diverging rays which I ever saw. This is\r\nperhaps the ultimatum of improvement, though a quadruple one, on the\r\nsame plan, might have the advantage in greater light and clearness,\r\nfrom its simplicity, and the paucity of its surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe quadruple or quintuple object-glasses are those which [p255] are\r\nbest adapted for the solar microscope, for they give a full-sized\r\nfield of view to this instrument, good to the edges, which no single\r\nobject-glass will do, as I have had occasion to remark in my paper on\r\nMr. Tulley’s aplanatics, unless converted into a compound, by means\r\nof eye-glasses, &c. This popular and highly amusing instrument will\r\nnow receive the utmost reformation and improvement of which it is\r\ncapable, and become truly scientific in its construction: hitherto it\r\nhas been a mere toy, but one degree removed from a magic lantern.\r\n\r\nI shall now allow Messrs. C. to say what they can for themselves, and\r\nto detail the various modifications which they have introduced into\r\ntheir instruments, since they executed Mr. Lister’s order, by giving\r\na translation of a letter I have received from them on the subject,\r\nand shall conclude by expressing a hope that no national or illiberal\r\nfeeling has entered into the composition of this critique, and that I\r\nhave used my oil, vinegar, and pepper in correct proportions.\r\n\r\n “_Paris, Oct. 15_.\r\n\r\n “Sir,\r\n\r\n “Accept our thanks for your extreme complaisance in offering\r\n to publish the results obtained by us in the construction of\r\n microscopes. Since the order executed for Mr. Lister, we have\r\n improved those instruments last completed, by greatly enlarging\r\n the diameter of the illuminating mirror, in order to obtain still\r\n greater light. The prism for opaque bodies is diminished about one\r\n half, and by a small modification in its mounting is rendered more\r\n serviceable: the diminution of the length of the body has enabled us\r\n to augment the magnifying powers by different eye-glasses, and the\r\n four double object-glasses placed in a better mounting can be used\r\n separately or in superposition, according to the pleasure of the\r\n observer, either to form quadruple objectives, or even to combine in\r\n a mass together. This last arrangement produces a great accession\r\n of magnifying power, without injuring the clearness of the image or\r\n arresting much light.\r\n\r\n “You see, Sir, that we have the pleasure of coinciding perfectly\r\n in your opinions about improvements, for we adopt the quadruple\r\n object-glass as the best, and we give three changes [p256] of\r\n eye-pieces. The double motion given to the body of a microscope is,\r\n in our idea, the defect of all those hitherto constructed; for, as\r\n the optical part should remain perfectly centred with the mirror\r\n and the diaphragms, it is evident that the least derangement of it\r\n from this position must destroy the perfection of the image: the\r\n stage then only should move[47] without affecting the diaphragms\r\n or the mirror, and in this we [p257] have well succeeded in\r\n the construction of the microscope of Sig. Amici. But all these\r\n arrangements much augment the price, and an observer ever so little\r\n practised will always find the object easily enough by means of his\r\n hands.\r\n\r\n “The prices of our achromatic microscopes are as follows:—\r\n\r\n “_Achromatic microscope_, like Mr. Lister’s—300 francs.\r\n\r\n “The same, with the latest improvements, three eye-pieces, and\r\n camera lucida for drawing the magnified objects—400 francs.\r\n\r\n “_Amician Microscope_, one horizontal achromatic, the stage\r\n giving all the motions to the object, with a micrometer screw,\r\n five eye-pieces, two camera lucidas, hand magnifier, frog trough,\r\n accessary apparatus, &c. _One catadioptric microscope_, mounted on\r\n the same stand, and adapting itself to the same apparatus; the two\r\n instruments inclosed in a mahogany case—1000 francs.\r\n\r\n “We trust that the very moderate prices of these instruments,\r\n together with the care which we bestow on their construction,\r\n will procure us orders for them. Their superiority has been duly\r\n recognized by the jury of the Exhibition of the Products of\r\n Industry, which has been pleased to decree to us a silver medal.\r\n\r\n “The Amician achromatic microscope is composed of a tube seven\r\n inches long, at the extremity of which is placed a prism, which\r\n reflects at a right angle the rays which come from the object-glass,\r\n composed (_as in our microscopes executed since 1824_) of four\r\n double object-glasses, which may be used separately, or two, three,\r\n or four at a time. The stand is a square bar, which has a rackwork,\r\n carrying a moveable stage, which, by means of adjusting screws\r\n ingeniously disposed, permits an object to traverse the field\r\n of view in every direction. This disposition gives the power of\r\n determining the real dimensions of objects submitted to observation\r\n by means of the micrometer screw, which is placed at the side, while\r\n the camera lucida affords the means of drawing their outline, and\r\n consequently of measuring the magnifying power.\r\n\r\n “The rays proceeding from the object which have passed the\r\n object-glass, and have been rendered horizontal by the prism, are\r\n received by different eye-pieces disposed after the manner of [p258]\r\n Ramsden. Their power can be varied. Each instrument carries six,\r\n five of which can be attached at pleasure either to the catadioptric\r\n or the achromatic. The deepest belonging to the reflector is a\r\n single lens of half a French line focus, and the most powerful of\r\n the achromatic is a line and a half.\r\n\r\n “Such, we think, are the details which you required: we wish that\r\n they may prove agreeable to you.\r\n\r\n “We beg you to accept the assurance of the high consideration with\r\n which we are, Sir,\r\n\r\n “Your very devoted Servants,\r\n\r\n “VINCENT CHEVALIER, ainé et fils.”\r\n\r\n “69, _Quai de l’Horloge_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [41] The objects employed by me in looking into the defects and\r\n excellencies of these glasses, were an artificial star, and a piece\r\n of enamelled dial-plate, the phenomena presented by which, _when put\r\n out of focus_, incontestably warrant the judgment I have pronounced\r\n upon them, as any, true optician will admit.\r\n\r\n [42] When an object-glass is out of adjustment, its maximum of\r\n distinctness is not in the centre of the field of view, but\r\n somewhere else, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\n [43] The question must naturally resolve itself into this point,\r\n for achromatics for microscopes, (as they are called,) were made by\r\n Dollond, Martin, and Pollard, many years ago; the only objection to\r\n them was, that they were _not effective_, consequently, _nominal\r\n only_, and useless. I defy any man to produce an _effective_\r\n object-glass, which can satisfactorily be proved to have been made\r\n before 1824.\r\n\r\n [44] See the _first_ instruction published by Messrs. C. along with\r\n their microscopes: “Microscope Achromatique selon Euler,” &c. I\r\n apprehend there is a misdate in Messrs. C.’s letter at the end of\r\n this paper, where they state they have made the achromatics _since_\r\n 1824, _with four objectives_, which implies that they also made them\r\n before that period, but in another way.\r\n\r\n [45] Mr. C. Tulley recommended the combination of two achromatics\r\n together from nearly the beginning of his son W.’s labours upon\r\n them, who rejected the idea, together with myself, as giving rise\r\n to too great a complication, _always supposing that triple glasses\r\n must be used_. I myself combined two triple achromatics together,\r\n for experiment sake, in a very early stage of our proceedings, but\r\n liked not the result, though effects were certainly produced by the\r\n composition, which could not be obtained from the best individual\r\n triple one.\r\n\r\n [46] The theory on which these object-glasses are constructed is\r\n contained in a paper of Euler’s, published at St. Petersburgh, in\r\n 1774. Messrs. Chevalier have caused it to be inserted entire in the\r\n “Bulletin de la Société d’Encouragement de Paris,” No. CCLIV., for\r\n Aug. 1825.\r\n\r\n [47] [Illustration]\r\n\r\n This is the theoretical view of the case, the practical one is\r\n different, as frequently happens. _Opaque objects_ are not affected\r\n at all by the eccentricity of the axis of the body: nor can I\r\n recollect that I ever felt any particular inconvenience from the\r\n motion of the optical part, even with transparent subjects, unless\r\n it was thrown _very much indeed_ out of the axis of the illuminating\r\n mirror. On the other hand, it is notorious that _living_ aquatic\r\n insects and animalcules are the most _popular_ and _entertaining_\r\n objects which microscopes can show. These are, for the most part,\r\n abundantly restless; and if the stage on which they are placed has\r\n any motion, their natural unquietness is so much exasperated, that\r\n it becomes almost impossible to get a good observation of them\r\n at all. I once set to work at making some drawings of a variety\r\n of new and original objects of this class (which, I trust, will\r\n one day be published) with a microscope having all the requisite\r\n motions applied to its stage, and am confident that I had thrice\r\n the labour fairly appropriate to the execution of my task from this\r\n oversight. The very tremor produced by the transition of a carriage\r\n in the street, is frequently sufficient to unsettle live objects\r\n when disposed to be still and quiet, and put them in a fidget for\r\n a quarter of an hour. It is very unfortunate that the mountings\r\n of optical instruments are made in general by mere mechanics, who\r\n seldom or never observe with them, and consequently know not the\r\n exigencies which occur in practice. It is still more unfortunate,\r\n that in the science of fitting up microscopes, an ounce of a man’s\r\n own wit is worth about a ton of his neighbour’s. Was it not that\r\n I dislike to verify this adage myself, I should recommend the\r\n following motion to be applied _to the body_:—let the socket of\r\n the arm which carries it have a smooth rotatory motion on the head\r\n of the bar in the usual way, conjoined with another horizontal one\r\n produced by rackwork attached to the said socket. Let the pinion\r\n which belongs to the latter movement be made very strong, so that a\r\n lever about three inches long may project from its centre: this is\r\n to be held in the hand, the thumb and index finger operating on the\r\n rackwork, while the two little fingers give a rotatory motion by\r\n working the lever end. _This rapid double motion is here completely\r\n under the command of_ one hand, _while the other is at liberty to\r\n adjust the focus_. I know of nothing better for general purposes, or\r\n in particular for following the motions of live insects, &c.; but\r\n when _only inanimate ones_ are to be the subject of microscopical\r\n study, I prefer the motion of the stage, for the reasons stated by\r\n Mons. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _On the Existence of Chlorine in the Native Black Oxide of\r\n Manganese._ By John M’Mullen, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the paper relating to this subject, which the editors of the\r\nQuarterly Journal of Science obligingly inserted in the forty-fourth\r\nnumber of that work, I described some experiments which I had made,\r\nto show that chlorine is uniformly evolved from the Native Black\r\nOxide of Manganese by the action of sulphuric acid, under certain\r\ncircumstances, which I endeavoured to detail with strict accuracy, so\r\nas to prevent any mistake or failure in the event of the experiment\r\nbeing repeated.\r\n\r\nUpon this paper Mr. Richard Phillips has made some observations\r\nin the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of Philosophy for April\r\nlast, to which I am desirous of briefly adverting. He says, “Mr.\r\nM’Mullen having observed, when sulphuric acid is added to peroxide\r\nof manganese, that chlorine is evolved, he conceived it might be\r\nderived from an admixture of muriate of manganese, iron, or copper;\r\nbut having washed some of the peroxide of manganese with water, he\r\ndid not find that any chloride of silver was precipitable from it;\r\nhe, therefore, concluded that the peroxide in question contained no\r\nmuriatic salt.” If Mr. Phillips will take the trouble to refer to my\r\npaper, he will find that this is by no means the statement which it\r\ncontains. I observed that, in order to separate any soluble [p259]\r\nmuriates which the oxide used might, in the first instance, have\r\ncontained, “I washed it every day, for three weeks successively,\r\nusing sometimes hot and sometimes cold water: _at the end of that\r\ntime_, I tested the water, which was _then_ decanted from the\r\nwashed manganese, by the nitrate of silver, but without finding the\r\nslightest appearance of precipitated chloride. I then poured upon the\r\nmanganese four times its weight of dilute sulphuric acid; allowed the\r\nmixture to stand _for about four weeks_, occasionally agitating it,\r\nand at the end of that time, found, when the dilute acid, now of a\r\ndeep crimson colour, _was removed from the subsident manganese_, and\r\nthe latter agitated, that the most decisive evidence of the presence\r\nof chlorine was exhibited in the vapour evolved from it.” I stated\r\nfurther, that I had “carefully preserved this particular mixture,\r\nand that after a lapse of more than twelve months, the residuary\r\nmanganese, when the supernatant acid was removed, continued to evolve\r\nchlorine.”\r\n\r\nIn this experiment my object was effectually to purify the manganese\r\nused from any soluble muriate which might by possibility have been\r\nmixed with it: I did not, however, test the water _first_ used in\r\nwashing it, but merely that which was _last_ removed from it.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips proceeds to observe that he had prepared some\r\nobservations, and at considerable length, _to prove_ that the author\r\nof the above paper has been completely misled by “forced analogies”\r\nand “erroneous experiments;” but that it _afterwards_ occurred to\r\nhim, that it would be better to show, in a few words, the real source\r\nof the chlorine in question, the evolution of which from peroxide of\r\nmanganese _he had noticed some time previous to the publication of\r\nmy papers_. That with this view he had procured various specimens of\r\nthe peroxide of manganese, (one of them in the crystallized state,)\r\nwhich were reduced to powder, and on the addition of sulphuric\r\nacid, chlorine was evolved from each. That he then washed separate\r\nportions of them with distilled water, and on the addition of nitrate\r\nof silver to the washings, chloride of silver was immediately\r\nprecipitated: sulphuric acid being poured upon the washed peroxide,\r\nno chlorine whatever was evolved. That he further added sulphuric\r\nacid to an unwashed portion, and to one which had [p260] been\r\nwashed, and referred both to a _bystander_, who immediately detected\r\nthe odour of chlorine in the former, but not in the latter. He then\r\nproceeds to show that the specimens of manganese which he had made\r\nthe subject of this experiment contained a portion of lime, and\r\nhe infers that the black oxide of manganese consequently contains\r\nmuriate of lime.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips asserts that I have been misled by erroneous\r\nexperiments. My reply is, that the experiment to which he refers,\r\nand which I have recapitulated, was carefully made, and is truly\r\nand faithfully detailed. In what, then, is it erroneous? It is not\r\nincompatible with that which he has produced as a refutation of it,\r\ninasmuch as he did not wait the result for which the perusal of my\r\nstatement should have prepared him, and which he clearly should not\r\nhave anticipated. He states that chlorine was not evolved from washed\r\nmanganese at the instant when sulphuric acid was affused upon it.\r\nThis is not a contradiction of my statement: I affirmed that, after\r\nwashed manganese had been exposed to the action of sulphuric acid\r\nfor a very considerable period, I distinctly observed the evolution\r\nof chlorine, and that for twelve months afterwards, _under the\r\ncircumstances detailed_, this continued to be the case:—all this\r\nI deliberately re-assert. I have frequently met with specimens of\r\nmanganese which, upon the first affusion of sulphuric acid, gave off\r\nchlorine; but _in general_, as far as my experience goes, _this is\r\nnot the case_: were it of uniform occurrence, and that the mixture of\r\nsulphuric acid and oxide of manganese rendered chlorine evident to\r\nthe smell, the fact _could not have remained unnoticed till now_.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Mr. Phillips, to which I now refer, did not come\r\ninto my hands till about three weeks ago. It fortunately happened\r\nthat I had still preserved the specimen of washed manganese upon\r\nwhich sulphuric acid had been affused, under the circumstances\r\nalready recapitulated, and it occurred to me that this would afford\r\noccasion, as decisive as I could desire, to put the accuracy of my\r\noriginal experiment, and the conclusions drawn from it, to further\r\nproof. I am bound to premise that this specimen of manganese,\r\nafter having been in the first washed and subjected to the action\r\nof sulphuric acid, as already mentioned, has ever since remained\r\nin [p261] the vessel in which the experiment was at first made,\r\ncovered with dilute sulphuric acid,—a period of more than eighteen\r\nmonths; and it will scarcely be doubted that, in the course of that\r\nlong interval, any muriate of lime which it might have originally\r\ncontained must have been thoroughly decomposed. Upon removing the\r\nsupernatant acid, the residuary manganese gave sensible evidence of\r\nthe presence of chlorine; paper stained with the solution of indigo\r\nin sulphuric acid was readily bleached by it, &c. I now proceeded\r\nto wash the manganese in pure water, and continued to do so until\r\nthe acid was no longer perceptible to the taste. I then washed it\r\nthree times successively with distilled water, and after decanting\r\noff the fluid of the last washing as closely as possible, added pure\r\nsulphuric acid in considerable quantity, and stirred the mixture\r\nthoroughly, after it had cooled, with a glass rod. At this time\r\nno vapour of chlorine was evident either to the smell or to the\r\nusual tests. The mixture was then set aside, and allowed to stand\r\nundisturbed for ten days: at the end of that time, when the acid\r\nwas poured off, and the subsident manganese agitated, the vapour of\r\nchlorine was as distinctly manifest as when it was first subjected to\r\nexperiment more than a year and a half ago.\r\n\r\n _Dublin, June_ 11, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Modern Improvements of Horticulture_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat gardening has always been one of the most natural, as well as\r\nthe most useful occupations of mankind, is obvious: that it has\r\nadvanced—been retarded—or flourished, according as general taste\r\nor wants, or peculiar political, moral, or local circumstances,\r\nwere favourable or adverse, is also sufficiently evident from all\r\nhistorical testimony;—but in no age has it advanced with such\r\nrapid strides towards perfection as it has done within the last\r\nfifty years. To bring the modern improvements in array before the\r\nreader,—to estimate their advantages in a public and private point\r\nof view,—to look forward from our present elevated station to the\r\nprobable results of continued, and extended application,—may be an\r\namusing, if not an [p262] useful inquiry: it may tend to remove\r\nbarriers which are only imaginary, and by freeing the thinking powers\r\nof practitioners from the trammels of custom, lead them forward\r\ninto that expanse of operative freedom, where much remains for the\r\nexercise of the inquiring mind, and experimental hand, in exploring\r\nthe yet untrodden field of practicability, and calling forth the\r\nstill latent powers and susceptibilities of pregnant nature.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the history of the first ages, we hear of a garden as\r\nsoon as we hear of man; and though, from the paucity of description,\r\nwe can only form ideas of such a place from the effusions of the\r\npoet, rather than from the detail of the historian, yet, in judging\r\nfrom what still appears of aboriginal scenery, we may conclude with\r\nMilton that a garden was a place,\r\n\r\n “A happy rural seat of various views;\r\n  Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm;\r\n  Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,\r\n  Hung amiable, and of delicious taste:\r\n  Betwixt them lawns—or the flow’ry lap\r\n  Of some irriguous valley spread her store.”—_Par. Lost_.\r\n\r\nIf such a place, it required care to rear the tender—to check the\r\nluxuriant—correct the irregular—to support the burdened—extirpate\r\nthe noisome weed—and repulse the browsing animal. Such was the only\r\noccupation of the first gardeners: for in those highly-favoured\r\nspots, those natural paradises, (some of which still remain in\r\nIndia,) where the groves which formed the habitations also supplied\r\nthe simple food of the inhabitants; where the cocoa-nut[48], with\r\nits various liquors, abounded; [p263] where the date, the mango,\r\ntamarind, and lime dropped in profusion into the hand; where the\r\nmelon tribe upon, and the nutritious yam beneath the surface of the\r\nbountiful soil, were all spontaneously supplied without care, and\r\nwithout toil:—in such circumstances, neither sagacity to contrive,\r\nnor ability to perform, were necessary, further than collecting and\r\npreserving those spontaneous gifts of nature.\r\n\r\nBut population increased; and when mankind became translocated to\r\nregions less favourable to vegetation, and where the spontaneous\r\nproductions of the earth were insufficient for their subsistence,\r\nthen the business of the planter and cultivator became a necessary\r\noccupation; and hence gardening would begin to assume a systematic\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAs improvements, and the times in which they took place, have\r\ndescended together in continuous and collateral streams, the\r\nnarration may be divided into three periods, viz.:—From the earliest\r\nages to the beginning of the sixteenth century;—from the beginning of\r\nthe sixteenth century to the end of the seventeenth;—and from that\r\nperiod to the present time.\r\n\r\nWe have already hinted at what were probably natural, or aboriginal\r\ngardens: the account is so far feasible from the fact, that such\r\nplaces and productions may be met with on the peninsula of India,\r\nat the present day: true it is, they cultivate rice, and some few\r\ninferior plants, where they have opportunity, and use them along with\r\ntheir wild fruits; but when they cannot procure these cultivated\r\nnecessaries, (which sometimes happens,) they must rely on the natural\r\nproductions. It is necessary to add, that some of the castes, from\r\nreligious principle, abhor the use of almost any kind of animal food;\r\nand, therefore, vegetables are their sole support.\r\n\r\nFrom Egyptian and Jewish history, we learn that gardens [p264]\r\nwere an appendage of the palaces of their princes, and other great\r\nmen, for personal solace and gratification; but how far the art was\r\nsystematized, either in knowledge or practice, history is silent.\r\nThroughout the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Macedonian empires,\r\nwe learn but little more than that ornamental gardening was carried\r\nto an extravagant height in their artificial formation; insomuch\r\nthat one of the Babylonian princes built what were called “hanging\r\ngardens,” that is, a vast and lofty pyramidal structure on arches,\r\narcades with terraces surmounted by other arcades, and carried up in\r\ngradations to a great height. The terraces being planted with the\r\nchoicest trees, presented to the distant spectator a verdant hill\r\nof foliage in the midst of a large city, and lifted the sovereign\r\nproprietor far above the noise and intrusive notice of his vassals\r\nbelow; at the same time, yielding him all the sweets, seclusion, and\r\nquiet of the country, even in the purlieu of his palace! The idea\r\nof such an ornamented and elevated structure for a mighty sovereign\r\nwas certainly sublime, and far surpassing all that has been yet done\r\n(though it has been suggested by Mr. Loudon) in the western world;\r\nand though only a monument of wealth and personal pride, prompted by\r\nconjugal regard, and entirely artificial, was certainly proper for\r\nthe place where it stood, worthy of the prince who erected, and the\r\nextensive empire to which it belonged.\r\n\r\nThroughout a long-following period, and up to the time of the Romans,\r\nwe learn nothing particular respecting gardens, only, that among the\r\nJews, they had gardens for herbs, vineyards, and even gardens for\r\ncucumbers: but as frequent allusions are made to them, it is probable\r\nthat gardening had then become a distinct calling, as we find it was\r\namong the Romans, as soon as their extensive conquests were secured.\r\n\r\nAs the arts and arms of the Romans went together, no doubt a very\r\nwide circulation of all that was known of gardening in Italy, was\r\ntransferred thence. Their writers on rural affairs preferred _agri_\r\nto _horti_culture; but their sound knowledge of the former shews\r\nno inconsiderable share of acquaintance with the principles of\r\nthe latter; and as their practice, as well as the seeds of their\r\nproducts, would be introduced wherever the climate permitted, it\r\nis more than probable they [p265] laid the foundation of British\r\ngardening. The rules and examples left by them, were probably\r\ncontinued, with occasional accessions to the stock both of practice\r\nand production, throughout the Heptarchy, the domination of the\r\nSaxons, Danes, and Normans: but these troublous times were not\r\nfavourable to the prosecution of the arts of peace; and it is not\r\nlikely much advancement in the art took place until the Norman power\r\nwas fully established; and even then their castellated mansions\r\nprecluded any extensive adaptation of garden, from the necessity of\r\nforming the glacis, for the greater security of the baronial hall:\r\nand though it is probable that, at this time, not a dwelling, from\r\nthe regal palace to the cottage, but had a garden of some size or\r\nother, yet the best practice was confined to the monasteries, and\r\nother religious corporations of those days, all over Christendom.\r\nTheir education and leisure, their foreign intercourse, their\r\ninterest in the tithes, and their love of superior vegetables and\r\ncondiments, on the many days they were restricted from indulging\r\nin the consumption of animal food, all contributed to incline the\r\nmonks to prosecute gardening on the most approved plans. Thus,\r\nItaly, Spain, and Germany became famous for their superior culinary\r\nvegetables, as France was for improved fruits; indeed, when war\r\ndepopulated or devastated a country, and when the gardens of the\r\nchâteau became a sacrifice to offensive or defensive operations,\r\nand when the potageries of the hamlets were trodden under foot and\r\ndestroyed by a licentious soldiery, the gardens of the religious\r\nhouses were often spared, and, consequently, many roots and fruits\r\nfound there an asylum, which was denied them in less privileged\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the lists of plants cultivated in those days, we find\r\nthe names of a great majority of the common sorts now in use, as\r\nwell culinary, as for the table or the press, with a great addition\r\nof physical plants, it being then a prevalent supposition that\r\nremedies for all the ailments of the human frame were existent in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, if they could be detected; the cultivation\r\nand gathering of simples, therefore, was a business which employed\r\nmany heads and many hands: even the Corinthian pillars of the noble\r\nprofession of physic were not entirely free from that malaria, which\r\nwas generated in the fumes of the herbalist’s shop! [p266]\r\n\r\nOrnamental gardening had hardly showed its graceful head; the little\r\nthat had been done of this in England, was only in imitation of the\r\nItalian school, though without their accompaniments of splendid\r\narchitecture, classical sculpture, and costly fountains. Such a\r\nstyle, in the near neighbourhood of a palace or mansion, is imposing\r\nand suitable, but the outskirts of such gardens, which should have\r\nbeen gradually blended with and into the free and beautiful forms\r\nof nature, were bounded and deformed by tortuous labyrinths, by\r\ncomplicated folds of nicely-clipped hedges, involving each other for\r\nno purpose than affording seclusion from the “licentious eye,” or a\r\n“maze to the intruding foot.”\r\n\r\nIt may be observed as somewhat unaccountable, the excellent taste of\r\ntheir landscape painters was never transferred from the canvass to\r\ntheir style of ornamental gardening. But so it was: the people who\r\nhad all kinds of assistance from artists of the first order, and from\r\nclassical and picturesque association within their own territory,\r\nlong remained blind to what was so natural and so manifestly within\r\ntheir reach!\r\n\r\nIn useful and profitable gardening, the fine climate of Italy gave\r\ngreat facility for successful cultivation of a profusion of the\r\nfinest fruits, and being an advanced post for the reception of all\r\nvaluable plants from both Asia and Africa, it much sooner than other\r\nEuropean countries possessed culinary vegetables in great variety,\r\nand of salad-herbs a numerous list.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the sixteenth century the improvements\r\nin gardening began to take the form of a system. The increasing\r\nsplendour of the English court, during the reigns of the virgin\r\nqueen and her father, and the princely establishments of some of\r\nher courtiers, called the art of gardening into notice and repute,\r\nand gave an impulse to the yet dormant powers of horticultural\r\npracticability. Continental artists were generally employed in\r\nlaying out the greater works. The sum of their professional ability\r\nwas chiefly geometrical, an exact knowledge of straight lines,\r\nsquares, and curves; they could line out a polygonal basin to a\r\nhair’s breadth, and construct a many-tiered jet d’eau in the midst.\r\nSuch, however, were the principal features admitted into, and which\r\nconstituted the style of those days, and continued through that and\r\nthe succeeding [p267] century. In the latter (the seventeenth),\r\nand during the domestic broils which then convulsed the kingdoms,\r\ngardening appears to have been, as to style, almost stationary. In\r\nthe mean time, however, the Reformation had been silently working\r\nsalutary effects, not only in the deliverance of men from a servile\r\nreligious thraldom, but also from the dogmas of precedential custom,\r\nand by imbuing them with a spirit of independence with respect to\r\nothers, gave, what was better, a _self-dependence_ in exertion,\r\nwhether of mind or action; and, after a few years of revolutionary\r\nexcess, and abuse of this inestimable acquisition of mental freedom,\r\nat last, in 1688, settled down into that rational state of composure,\r\nwhich, with few interruptions, has happily remained to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThen it was that gardening, in all its branches, was patronised and\r\nencouraged. Tournefort in France, and Ray in England, enlightened\r\nthe public by their description, enumeration, and classification\r\nof plants. Evelyn called attention to the usefulness and national\r\nvalue of forest trees; several authors developed the mysteries of\r\nkitchen-garden and orchard management; collections of exotic plants\r\nwere made, and glass-cases built for their reception; floriculture\r\nreceived a share of the gardener’s attention; and in short, there\r\nseemed to be, about this time, a general movement by united exertion\r\nto gain what had been previously neglected, and complete what had\r\nbeen only feebly attempted.\r\n\r\nThe accession of William and Mary to the British throne very\r\nnaturally introduced Dutch gardening and architecture. The old\r\nItalian and French styles received very little, if any, amendment.\r\nThe avenue, the canal, the rectangular clumps and borders, the\r\nshelves and slopes, the terrace, with its stairs, were all maintained\r\nand extended, the whole surrounded by exactly-clipped hedges, and\r\nbedotted with fanciful and unnaturally cut trees. This expensive and\r\nridiculous fashion had its admirers for a time, but at last fell into\r\ndisrepute, not by a bull or anathema, but chiefly by the keen sarcasm\r\nof a Pope!\r\n\r\nKitchen-gardens were improved by additional brick-walls for the\r\nmore delicate kinds of fruit, as vines, figs, peaches, nectarins,\r\napricots, &c. Hot-beds were in general use, and, many hot-houses were\r\nerected for different kinds of the above [p268] as well as for the\r\npine-apple. In those days our fruit-lists contained twenty sorts, of\r\nwhich there were many varieties. Of culinary vegetables there were,\r\nof roots eighteen, of shoots four, of leaves fourteen, of flowers\r\nthree, of seeds three, of pods two, and of herbs for all purposes\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nFrom that period, the commencement of the eighteenth century, every\r\nsucceeding year brought forth new objects of the gardener’s care, and\r\nimproved operations for his imitation. The acquirements of natural\r\nscience, radiating from such a character as Sir Hans Sloane, whose\r\ntheories were imbibed and confirmed by the practical abilities of\r\nPhilip Miller, were, at that time, like the orb of day bursting\r\nfrom behind a cloud! Scientific light and practical life were shed\r\non all around, and the foundation was then laid, by their united\r\nmeans, on which has been raised almost all the varied structure\r\nof modern horticultural improvement. It would be impossible, as\r\nneedless, to give the names of the authors, who, from this period,\r\nshowed themselves in print on the subject of gardening, for, were\r\nthe respective merits of their literary labours noticed, and the\r\nsuccessive discoveries and advances chronicled, the amount would\r\nbe voluminous indeed. But the following celebrated names cannot,\r\nin justice to their memories, be omitted. The great Linnæus was\r\ndeservedly at the head of the botanical branch of gardening;\r\nMiller, with his satellites, Gordon, Lee, and Aiton were at that of\r\npractical botany, as well as of all the other parts of operative\r\ngardening; and, as a leading orchardist, Kennedy, and many others\r\non miscellaneous subjects, produced respectable directories and\r\nkalendars.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of ornamental gardening kept pace with that of\r\nthe more useful. Soon as the old style of rigid formality had\r\nbeen exposed, it was exploded; more refined principles of taste\r\nprevailed; its outlines became better defined; it was found that\r\nthere are certain fixed principles in nature, on which the elements\r\nof true taste are naturally (not capriciously) founded; that delight\r\nand gratification to the eye, or mind, can only arise from the\r\nharmony and fitness of the combinations of art or design; that the\r\nsensations of beauty and sublimity can only be conveyed by congruous\r\nassociations of parts to the whole; and that the incidents found in\r\n[p269] conjunction in nature, should be the objects of imitation\r\nof the gardener’s, as they had long been that of the painter’s art,\r\nwith this exception, that in the immediate vicinity of the mansion as\r\nmuch of the old style should be retained as will harmonize with the\r\nnecessary artificial façade of the architecture; but soon as departed\r\nfrom these creations of art, let then appear the varied flow of\r\nnature’s devious garb.\r\n\r\nThe art of painting had, in the best schools, proceeded on such\r\nprinciples, and the formation of real scenery was improved from\r\nwhat was so prominent in the fictitious. Some painters, even Claude\r\nLorraine himself, have occasionally erred, from what may be called\r\n_exuberance of design_, in producing extreme effect, by introducing\r\nlights which never can be seen by day or night, at dawn or twilight;\r\nby trees which never existed, and by forms[49] which had only an\r\nimaginary existence. Landscape gardeners, too, in the transition from\r\nthe tame to the more natural style, have run into error, by imitating\r\nadmirable incidents frequently seen in nature’s works, forgetting\r\nthat their value springs entirely from their having happened by\r\nchance, but, as works of art, lose all their interest, and become\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nWe are now arrived on the confines of our own times, of which we will\r\ntake a general view, and which will sufficiently show the accumulated\r\nassemblage of horticultural objects, productions, and knowledge; and\r\nwhich will also give, what was proposed, a comparative survey of the\r\nextent of our improvements.\r\n\r\nAnd first, as to the highest department, Botany. Before the sexual\r\nsystem of Linnæus was fairly established, (though it spread far\r\nand wide by the literary labours of Hudson, Lee, Curtis, and\r\nseveral other able contemporary writers, both in England and on\r\nthe continent,) defects were found in it, and not only as to the\r\nterms of distinction, but also to its bringing together, in the\r\nclassification, plants which appeared, from their [p270] exterior\r\nhabit and qualities, to have no natural affinity to each other. This\r\nLinnæus was aware of himself, and left some fragments of a natural\r\narrangement, but which he did not live to complete. This, or the\r\nidea of it, however, was taken up by Jussieu, a French botanist, and\r\ncompleted as far, perhaps, as it can be; and though, in our present\r\nbotanical publications, both systems are continued, yet it is likely\r\nthat Jussieu’s simplified system will, in time, supersede the other,\r\nthough the curious fact on which that of Linnæus was founded will\r\nnever be forgotten, because of its practical use in the amelioration\r\nof fruits. Botanical publications, under the various names of\r\nHortuses, Floras, Monographs, and of every country and district\r\nunder the skies, and since the promulgation of Jussieu’s system,\r\nmonographs, under the titles of Geraniaceæ, Cistineæ, &c., flow in\r\nperiodical floods from the press, crowd the bookseller’s shelves, and\r\nthence find their way to every elegant drawing-room in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis additional call on the business of the press, as well as upon\r\nthe talent of the artist, arises from the fashionable and refined\r\nbias of the public taste for this rational and delightful study.\r\nTo extend botanical collections, and the desire to possess every\r\nvegetable beauty, pervaded the whole community: hence expeditions to\r\ndistant lands by collectors; hence the extension and encouragement\r\nof nursery business; hence have sprung up chartered societies and\r\nassociations for the encouragement of botany and gardening all over\r\nthe realm; so that vegetable beauties and curiosities are now to be\r\nseen in British collections, from every region of the known world.\r\n\r\nNeither has the occult subject of botanical physiology been\r\nneglected; many curious facts connected with the organisation,\r\nstructure, functions, and qualities of plants, have been ascertained:\r\nbut still there remains much for the employment of the naturalist’s\r\nmind on this difficult subject.\r\n\r\nLandscape gardening is not so much “the rage” as it was twenty or\r\nthirty years ago: national circumstances, perhaps, may be the cause;\r\nbut its principles are much better understood. The errors of Kent\r\nand Brown, and their followers, have been corrected by the works and\r\nwritings of Repton, and the critiques of Knight and Price, whose\r\ntheories have been [p271] carried into practice by Loudon and\r\nothers; and nothing will prevent the universal adoption of their\r\nprinciples, but the difficulty of giving the foreground from _home\r\nwalks_ the extreme degree of ruggedness so much admired, and even\r\nindispensable to the painter. Fern, (unless we can introduce some\r\nuncommon foreign variety,) burdock, kexes, cannot be admitted into\r\ndressed ground; nor have we any plants in cultivation which would\r\nwell answer the purpose; true, we have the rhubarb, one or two sorts\r\nof thistles, eryngiums, palma Christi, and gourds with their ample\r\nleaves: but these would only appear intruders, and misplaced: but\r\nmuch may be done by a judicious disposition of our common shrubs,\r\nso as to conceal the traces of the spade and line, and give all our\r\ncombinations of land, wood, and water that flowing character, which\r\nis so true to nature, and so pleasing to the refined eye of taste.\r\n\r\nFloriculture, which has been imported from France and Holland, is\r\nalso intensely followed about London, as well as in our manufacturing\r\nprovinces. Authors have creditably appeared in this line too; and our\r\nannual blows of flowers, both home-cultivated and imported, are at\r\nonce rich and costly. Tulips, hyacinths, narcissuses, ranunculuses,\r\nand anemones, are the principal bed flowers: but roses, stocks,\r\ndahlias, chrysanthemums, and even poppies, are out of number.\r\nFlowering shrubs, both within and without doors, are eminently rich\r\nand various, and astonish as much by the splendour of their colours\r\nas by their elegant forms and number.\r\n\r\nOrcharding has declined during the last fifty years: first, because\r\nof the gradual deterioration of the trees, and precariousness of the\r\ncrops; next, from the improved way of agricultural labourers’ manner\r\nof living. This change renders the use of small cider and perry less\r\nnecessary in a farm-house, causing an increased consumption of malt\r\nliquor; and this again, occasioning a greater demand for barley, at\r\nonce pleases both the farmer and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\nThus the cultivation of orchard fruit (except cherries[50]) has\r\ngreatly fallen off; and the decayed state of the old, and difficulty\r\nof [p272] raising new orchards, has given a check to such exertion,\r\nexcept in places at a distance from the metropolis, where orchards\r\nhave suffered less from decay, and where the habits of the cider\r\ndrinkers are more inveterate. Mr. Knight, the President of the\r\nHorticultural Society, has written copiously on this subject, and\r\nvery properly considers the cultivation of orchard fruit as a\r\nnational object; and by his example has done as much, nay, much more,\r\nthan any other gentleman in the kingdom, to restore our orchards\r\nto what they used to be, and what they may be,—and it is hoped his\r\nexcellent instructions will not be thrown away.\r\n\r\nKitchen-gardening, the most important and useful branch of the\r\nsubject, next demands attention; and here we are gratified with\r\na fine display of the efficacy of perseverance, the success of\r\nexperience, and the triumphs of skill. In every month of the year, in\r\nspite of the winter’s frost or summer’s sun, our tables are supplied\r\nwith wholesome and agreeable vegetables:—of roots we have fourteen\r\nsorts; of stems, shoots, and leaf-stalks, seven; of leaves, eight; of\r\nflowers, four: of culinary fruits we have sixteen; of seeds and pods,\r\nsix; of condimental herbs we have twenty-nine; and of herbs and seeds\r\nfor confections there are seven, besides various fruit: of roots,\r\nleaves, flowers, and fruit, for salads, there are in cultivation\r\ntwenty-two kinds; and various sorts of plants for medicine and\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nOf table-fruit there are above twenty different species, and of\r\nthese numberless varieties, extending to several hundreds, or even\r\nthousands, of various excellency and value.\r\n\r\nA few tropical and foreign fruits, not included in the above, have\r\nbeen cultivated in tolerable perfection in Europe within these few\r\nyears, viz. the Chinese loquat and litchee, the custard apple,\r\nmangosteen, and mango, &c.; and there is no doubt, if these fruits\r\ncould be worked on some hardier kindred stock, and a suitable place\r\nformed for them in a stove, they might be cultivated with the same\r\nsuccess as the anana.\r\n\r\nIn the forcing department of gardening, wonders have been\r\naccomplished. By this application of art, we appropriate to ourselves\r\nan almost perfect imitation of any of the warmer [p273] climates:\r\nheat, that powerful agent in the development of vegetation, we can\r\nhave in any degree, by stoves, by fermenting substances, and from\r\nthe steam of boiling water: light, a no less necessary agent in the\r\nmaturation of fruits, we combine with the former, by glazed houses\r\nand frames.\r\n\r\nThe various expedients for obtaining the necessary degree of heat,\r\nare, first, the most simple method of a stove, with its flue passing\r\nthrough or round the floor of the house, and this for warming the\r\nair within; but in this case, as the roots of the plants do not\r\nsufficiently, it is supposed, receive the proper degree of heat,\r\nvarious fermenting substances, as recent stable-yard dung, tanners’\r\nbark, oak and other leaves of trees, &c. are formed into beds, on\r\nwhich the compost of earth is placed, as in hot-bed frames, or in\r\nwhich the pots containing the plants are placed, or plunged, as in\r\na hot-house. To obtain the same effect, borders within houses are\r\nformed for the roots, having an excavated heat-chamber beneath,\r\nsupplied by simple stove flues, or from the fermenting substances\r\nabove named, or from steam admitted for the purpose. This mode of\r\nsupplying an equal degree of heat to the roots, as well as to the\r\nleaves and branches of a plant, is plausible, and cannot be far\r\nwrong, because it has been attended with success: but there is,\r\nperhaps, more attributed to it than it deserves, because the region\r\nor stratum of the soil, which is naturally occupied by roots,\r\ndiffers, in respect of temperature, much less over the whole surface\r\nof our globe, than is commonly imagined. The heat of the air in\r\ndifferent latitudes ranges from several degrees below zero to 110\r\ndegrees of Fahrenheit’s scale; but the temperature of the earth\r\neighteen inches below the surface, it is probable, does not vary\r\nmore than ten or fifteen. In England spring water varies only two\r\ndegrees, viz. from 42 degrees in summer to 40 degrees in winter; and\r\nthe effects of our hardest frosts very rarely penetrate deeper than\r\nnine inches; but it is necessary to observe, that, in such cases,\r\nas well as in hotbeds, we _force_ as well as defend; and probably,\r\nby such mode of applying heat and moisture, nutritious gases may\r\nbe communicated, which may be no small advantage. Besides, the\r\natmosphere of the house can (as is done) be impregnated with the same\r\nqualities and degrees of heat and humidity [p274] (a most necessary\r\naccompaniment[51],) which may be generated below.\r\n\r\nLight is a most potent agent in the maturation of vegetables:\r\nunited with a moderate degree of cold, it is much more effectual\r\nin progressive vegetation, than the necessary degree of heat with\r\ndarkness. Exposure to light is indispensable to plants: and,\r\ntherefore, our glass cases are formed to admit as much as possible.\r\nWithin these few years, the endeavour to gain an accession of light\r\nby reducing the dimensions of the wooden scantling of hot houses\r\nsuggested the idea of metallic frames; and for the concentration of\r\nthe sun’s rays, horizontal as well as vertical curvilinear roofs have\r\nbeen constructed. Lightness to the eye, durability, imperceptible\r\nexpansion, and glazed with panes, cut like segments of circles, to\r\nfacilitate the passing off of condensed water, with complete command\r\nof ventilation, are an assemblage of properties, always as desirable\r\nas necessary; and as they may be cast in the most elegant forms,\r\nand protected by paint, they add greatly to the ornament of the\r\ngarden. Beautiful as these buildings are, some little disappointment\r\nhas taken place respecting them: it has been experienced, that the\r\nintensity of the sun’s light, or heat, has been found detrimental\r\nto the tender inmates, and that shading is as necessary in bright,\r\nas light is in cloudy weather. Certain it is, that in the winter\r\nseason, when light and heat are most desirable, no fear need be\r\nentertained from this circumstance; and it ought to be considered,\r\nthat in our summer, we have at least, daily, _four hours_ more sun\r\nthan intertropical plants have at home: of course, they have less\r\ntime for their evening’s repose, (which all plants more or less\r\nrequire); besides, it should be thought of, that all plants are not\r\nequally formed to sustain such a blaze of light; “some affect the sun\r\nand some the shade;” such as the pine-apple[52], and orange, which\r\nrequire “a warm [p275] shade;” and perhaps all plants which present\r\na large reflecting surface of foliage to the sun, are content with\r\na smaller share of his direct rays. These observations attended to,\r\nsun-shades may be applied for occasional use, and with the plants at\r\na proper distance from the glass, will certainly secure them from all\r\nthe inconvenience of such buildings, while none of the advantages are\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen-garden range of buildings includes pine-stoves, vineries,\r\nhouses for peaches, and nectarines, figs, and cherries, hot-walls,\r\npits for succession pines, melons, cucumbers; besides store pits for\r\nroots, tender vegetables, salading, &c., as well as frames for many\r\npurposes of cultivation. Mushrooms are usually raised in sheds behind\r\nthe houses. The hot-houses are also used for growing early culinary\r\nvegetables, and small fruits in pots.\r\n\r\n [To be continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [48] The cocoa palm is rather a gigantic herb than a tree: the stem\r\n rises to a great height, of a strongly tough fibrous substance, but\r\n never so indurated as timber, though it is used in the construction\r\n of houses. It has no branches; but is crowned with from five to\r\n seven ample compound leaves, forming an umbrella-like head. The\r\n spatha issues from the centre, and soon falls pendent between and\r\n below the footstalks of the leaves, where it flowers and ripens the\r\n fruit. The nut is enveloped in a thick brown fibrous husk, which\r\n opens to shed it when fully ripe. The nut, when opened, yields\r\n two liquids, which are nutritious, and accounted delicacies: the\r\n first is the milk which runs out; the next is the cream which is\r\n procured by being scooped off the kernel with a spoon: this is of\r\n thick consistence, and much resembles the cream of milk. After\r\n these remains the perfectly-formed layer of kernel attached to the\r\n shell, and which is used along with the liquids as an article of\r\n food. But another most pleasant beverage, called toddy, is obtained\r\n from this palm, and which constitutes the chief value of the plant.\r\n The fruit is sacrificed to procure this; soon as the frond becomes\r\n pendent, the extremity is cut off, and a narrow-necked vessel is\r\n slung thereto to receive the streaming sap. This, both before and\r\n after being fermented, is an agreeable and refreshing drink. It also\r\n yields an ardent spirit by distillation, but of which the natives\r\n deny themselves the use.\r\n\r\n [49] In Martin’s painting of the Paphian Bower, though a fine\r\n composition, the roots of the tree, on the left of the foreground,\r\n are too much out of the ground. The accidental exposure of roots\r\n on the bank of a stream, or high-road, and their buttress-like\r\n departure from the trunk, are legitimate objects for the pencil; but\r\n their ramifications pourtrayed on the surface of the ground, is as\r\n ridiculous as unnatural.\r\n\r\n [50] It is said that many of the Caroon cherries brought to\r\n Covent-garden market, are bought up for the purpose of colouring\r\n wine on the Continent.\r\n\r\n [51] The admission of humidity into forcing-houses is attended by\r\n the most salutary consequences: it counteracts the bad effects\r\n of fire-heat, and is inimical to many insects. For this purpose,\r\n a steam-supplying apparatus is added to the best-constructed\r\n hot-houses, productive of the greatest advantages.\r\n\r\n [52] It has long been observed by gardeners, that the pine-apple\r\n always does best in forcing-pits, merely from the circumstance of\r\n there being more shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Chemical Manipulation, being Instructions to Students in Chemistry,\r\n on the Methods of performing Experiments of Demonstration, or of\r\n Research, with accuracy and success By_ Michael Faraday, F.R.S., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not positively assert that no one except Mr. Faraday could\r\nhave written this book, but we are of opinion that there are very\r\nfew chemists adequate to such a task, which has manifestly required\r\na considerable share of practical skill, much deep and theoretical\r\nknowledge, and no small degree of patience and perseverance,\r\nmore especially shown in the clearness of the details, and the\r\nperspicuous manner in which he has managed to describe prolix and\r\ndifficult processes. The work moreover fills up a chasm in chemical\r\nliterature, by embodying almost all that is important relating to\r\nchemical manipulation scattered through the writings of others;\r\nwhile the author’s extensive experience has enabled him to correct\r\ntheir faults, and to present the student and operator with many new\r\nand important facts and processes, by which the researches of the\r\nlaboratory are most essentially facilitated.\r\n\r\nSuch is our general opinion of the treatise before us, and we are\r\npersuaded that those who are capable of appreciating its merits will\r\nagree in our decision; but it is not so easy to [p276] substantiate\r\nour judgment by quotations, in consequence of the general didactic\r\ncharacter of the book, and the mutual dependence and connexion of\r\nits different parts. We shall attempt, however, to give the general\r\nreader an outline of its contents, and point out such parts to the\r\nchemist as we conceive particularly useful and worthy attention.\r\n\r\nThe importance of readiness and dexterity in the performance of\r\nexperiments has been duly estimated for more than a century. The\r\nwritings of Black, Cavendish, Priestley, and especially Scheele, as\r\nopposed to those of their predecessors, show that they had acquired\r\nconsiderable facility in attaining, by simple and economical means,\r\nthose ends which had before consumed much time and much expense\r\nin their accomplishment: but it is only of late years that the\r\nrefinements of manipulation have been carried towards perfection;\r\nand the researches carried on in the laboratory of the Royal\r\nInstitution have been not a little conducive to this improvement:\r\nto no one, however, is this part of the science more indebted than\r\nto Dr. Wollaston, whose skill in what may be called microscopic\r\nchemistry is consummate, and who has a host of humble but industrious\r\nimitators. So essential, indeed, is the attainment of correct\r\nmethods of manipulation to the progress of chemical science, that\r\nmany entire trains of research are exclusively dependent upon it for\r\nsuccess. It is true that it must always be subordinate to genius and\r\ninvention; yet the person who could only devise, without knowing how\r\nto perform, would comparatively be able to lend little aid to the\r\nextension and usefulness of knowledge: and were it not an invidious\r\ntask, we might be able to show that some of the greatest discoveries\r\nand improvements of the science have originated in dexterity of\r\nexperiment, rather than in profundity of design. By tact, therefore,\r\nin manipulation, a considerable advantage is gained, independent\r\nof that resulting from an acquaintance with the principles of the\r\nscience; and this is so considerable, that, of two persons of\r\nequal talent and information in other respects, he who is the best\r\nmanipulator will soon be in advance of the other; the one will draw\r\njust inferences with accuracy and rapidity, while the other will be\r\nlost in doubt, and often led into error. Mr. Faraday has pointed out\r\nseveral other cases of prominent advantage, arising from skilful\r\nmanipulation, especially when very small quantities of matter are to\r\nbe operated upon, and where accurate conclusions are of more than\r\nordinary importance, as in testing for arsenic and other poisons\r\non judicial occasions. When the substance under examination is\r\nrare, [p277] as often happens, the facility of working with small\r\nquantities is also of much importance, as otherwise the opportunity\r\nof gaining information may be lost, or only retained at great\r\nexpense. “There existed,” says our author, “in the British Museum\r\na small fragment of a black stone, the source and history of which\r\nwas unknown: it was unique, no other specimen being in the Museum,\r\nor known to be in existence; yet as it presented some peculiar\r\ncharacters, Mr. Hatchett was induced to examine it, and, working with\r\na portion of the stone weighing not more than two hundred grains, he\r\nwas enabled to discover in it a new metal, which he distinguished,\r\nby its various characters, from all those previously known, and\r\nwhich he named Columbium. Ekeberg afterwards discovered a metal,\r\nwhich he named Tantalium, conceiving it to have been observed and\r\ndistinguished for the first time by himself; but Dr. Wollaston, who\r\nexamined it, and compared it with columbium, was able to identify it\r\nwith that metal, although he had not more than five grains of the\r\nstone from the British Museum upon which to make his experiments.”\r\n\r\nIn short, there can be but one opinion respecting the first-rate\r\nimportance of expertness in manipulation, and neatness, dexterity,\r\nand efficacy of experimenting. These are the subjects to which\r\nthe present volume is directed, and which will, therefore, form a\r\nvaluable accompaniment to the more general and systematic works. They\r\nare discussed under the following general heads:—\r\n\r\n _The conveniences and requisites of a laboratory_.\r\n _Chemical apparatus, and its uses_.\r\n _The methods of performing chemical operations_.\r\n _The facilities acquired by practice; and,_\r\n _The causes which make experiments fail or succeed_.\r\n\r\nThe description of a laboratory is followed by two long and\r\nwell-written sections on the arts of weighing and measuring, in which\r\nthe account of the methods of determining specific gravities, and of\r\nthe general management of a delicate balance, are well deserving the\r\nstudent’s attentive perusal: indeed, there are no operations which\r\nare more frequently performed in a slovenly and careless manner, than\r\nthose in which scales and weights are concerned; and we should advise\r\nthe tyro to sit down with his balance and this book before him, and\r\npractise the manipulations which it explains.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section, on the sources and management of heat, is devoted\r\nto the construction and management of different kinds of furnaces,\r\nlamps, blowpipes, thermometers, and pyrometers, and abounds in useful\r\nhints, and in the details of [p278] practical information; and\r\nthe same remark applies to the succeeding sections on comminution\r\nand solution—indeed, we were surprised at finding so much to be\r\ntaught in regard to these very simple operations. The seventh,\r\neighth, and ninth sections treat of distillation and sublimation,\r\nprecipitation, and filtration. Here, and indeed throughout the work,\r\nthe wood-cuts are particularly distinct and well executed. In the\r\nsection on crystallization, the uses of that process are enumerated;\r\nand to this succeeds an account of evaporation. All these operations\r\nare extremely well investigated and described, both as to their\r\nprinciples and as to the most proper means of effecting them; a\r\nnumber of curious circumstances are pointed out, by which their\r\nresults are influenced, and by which certainty and success may be\r\ninsured.\r\n\r\nThe uses of coloured tests are explained and illustrated in the\r\ntwelfth section. Of coloured liquids the author chiefly recommends\r\nthe infusion of red cabbage; and as it is not only a very good test\r\nfor private experiments but of excellent service to the public\r\nlecturer in rendering certain changes of composition visible to\r\nan audience, it may be worth while extracting the directions for\r\npreparing it.\r\n\r\n  “583. The only substance of the kind, perhaps, worth keeping in\r\n solution, is an acid infusion of red cabbage. For its preparation,\r\n one or more red cabbages should be cut into strips, and boiling\r\n water poured upon the pieces; a little dilute sulphuric acid is to\r\n be added, and the whole well stirred: it is then to be covered and\r\n kept hot as long as possible, or, if convenient, should be heated\r\n nearly to boiling, for an hour or two, in a copper or earthen\r\n vessel. The quantity of water to be added at first should be\r\n sufficient to cover the cabbage, and the sulphuric acid should be\r\n in the proportion of about half an ounce of strong oil of vitriol\r\n by measure to each good-sized plant. This being done, the fluid\r\n should be separated and drained off, and as much more hot water\r\n poured on as will cover the solid residue, adding a very little\r\n sulphuric acid. The whole is to be closed up, and suffered to\r\n stand until cold, and then the liquid poured off and added to the\r\n former infusion. The cabbage may now be thrown away. The infusion\r\n is to be evaporated to one half or one third its first bulk, poured\r\n into a jar, allowed to settle, and the clear red fluid decanted\r\n and preserved in bottles. The residue may have water added to\r\n it, the solid part be allowed to subside, the clear liquor drawn\r\n off, evaporated and added to the former, or it may be dismissed\r\n altogether. This solution will keep for a year. When [p279] required\r\n for use, the acid of a small portion of it should be neutralized\r\n by caustic potash, or soda, (not by ammonia,) when it will assume\r\n an intensely deep blue colour, and will, in most cases, require\r\n dilution with twelve or fourteen parts of water. The red liquor of\r\n pickle cabbage will, occasionally, answer the uses of the solution,\r\n and is, when required for service, to be neutralized in a similar\r\n manner.”\r\n\r\nFor test-papers, litmus and turmeric are the most essential, and\r\nseveral precautions in preparing and using them are here pointed out,\r\nwhich, though apparently trivial, are, in fact, extremely important\r\nin insuring correct conclusions. We transcribe a part of the account\r\nof the applications of these coloured papers, as a specimen of the\r\nclear minuteness with which the details of the work are given, and as\r\na sample of the author’s general method and style, where subjects of\r\nmuch greater intricacy are to be explained.\r\n\r\n “591. In using these test papers with a fluid suspected to contain\r\n free acid or alkali, or knowing that one of these substances is\r\n predominant, to ascertain which is so, all that is necessary is to\r\n moisten them with the liquid, and observe the change: if the fluid\r\n be acid, the blue colour of the litmus will immediately become red;\r\n if alkaline, the yellow colour of the turmeric will be changed to a\r\n brown. The moistening may be effected by dipping the paper into the\r\n liquid; but a better method is to touch the edge of the slip with\r\n a rod dipped in the fluid. In the latter case there is no risk of\r\n contamination to the fluid from the paper, and only a very minute\r\n quantity of the liquid is used at once.\r\n\r\n “592. These trials must be made by day-light; artificial light not\r\n permitting that just estimation of the changes by which the presence\r\n of a small excess of acid or alkali is to be determined. As the\r\n proportion of free acid or alkali diminishes, the intensity of the\r\n new tint produced upon the paper is also diminished; and when in\r\n very small quantity, it requires considerable attention before a\r\n decision can be arrived at. The test paper should occasionally be\r\n touched with pure water in the immediate neighbourhood of the part\r\n where the solution has been applied, for any change in appearance\r\n that may have occurred, not due to mere moistening, is then readily\r\n perceived.\r\n\r\n “593. Although acid is generally tested for by litmus paper,\r\n and alkali by turmeric paper, yet the former is sometimes used\r\n advantageously for the latter purpose, being first slightly\r\n reddened, either by exposure to the air, or by momentary contact\r\n with muriatic acid fumes. When the [p280] paper thus modified is\r\n used to detect a free alkali, instead of turmeric paper, that\r\n substance is indicated by the restoration of the original blue\r\n colour. Litmus paper is best slightly reddened for this use, by\r\n putting a drop or two of muriatic acid into a large jar, allowing\r\n it to stand a few minutes, and then bringing the paper towards the\r\n mouth of the jar, or carefully placing it within: so soon as the\r\n blue tint has become slightly reddened, the paper should be removed\r\n for use. If too much acid be imparted to the paper, the delicacy\r\n of its indications is injured, because of the greater quantity of\r\n alkali required to neutralize the acid, and restore the blue colour.\r\n For the same reason a paper free from alkali or carbonate of lime\r\n has been recommended for the preparation of these tests: for these\r\n impurities, combining with a minute portion of acid, neutralize it,\r\n and thus prevent that delicacy of indication which the test paper\r\n ought and may be made to possess.”\r\n\r\nThe mode of determining the value of alcaline substances, or\r\n“alcalimetry,” is described at length in this section. Our readers,\r\nhowever, will here recollect that there is an error respecting the\r\nspecific gravity of the acid, which Mr. Faraday has corrected at page\r\n221 of the present volume of this Journal. The thirteenth section\r\nis allotted to crucible operations, and the fourteenth to furnace\r\ntube operations. They are full of minute and admirable instructions,\r\nevidently deduced from long experience, and detailed with the\r\nsame precision and clearness which we have already eulogised. The\r\nfifteenth section, which occupies nearly a hundred pages, relates to\r\n“pneumatic manipulation, or management of gases.” Every paragraph of\r\nthe instructions here given will be found to contain something of\r\nimportance to the student; it is, indeed, a valuable essay upon a\r\ndifficult and nice department of chemical research.\r\n\r\nUnder the head “Tube Chemistry,” in the sixteenth section, a\r\nvariety of means are pointed out, of working with and employing\r\nglass-tubes, as substitutes for more expensive and formal apparatus.\r\nIndeed, the young chemist cannot do better than practise the art of\r\nbending, drawing out, and sealing tubes, as here directed, (and in\r\nthe nineteenth section,) by which he will soon gain the requisite\r\ndexterity in forming them into test tubes, retorts, and so on, and\r\nbe enabled to furnish his laboratory with a quantity of very useful\r\nvessels and apparatus, at a very moderate expense.\r\n\r\nThe application of electricity to chemical purposes forms the subject\r\nof the seventeenth section, in which the [p281] management of\r\nelectrical machines and apparatus is described, and the circumstances\r\nnecessary to facilitate investigation and insure success are pointed\r\nout. To this succeed the management and composition of lutes, and a\r\nchapter on bending blowing, and cutting glass.\r\n\r\nCleanliness, order, and regularity are of the utmost importance in\r\nthe laboratory; and though the appearance of the chemist himself\r\nis often such that he appears “to doat upon dirt,” the strictest\r\nnicety must generally be observed in the state of his utensils and\r\napparatus. These matters must, indeed, generally engage his personal\r\nattention; and it is not sufficient that glasses and other vessels\r\nbe merely washed and wiped in the usual way, but they are generally\r\nrequired to be free from the minutest portions of adhering matter.\r\nA section is accordingly appropriated to the subject of cleanliness\r\nand cleansing, in which, and in that which follows it, entitled\r\n“General Rules for young Experimenters,” much information is conveyed\r\nthat will prove useful to those who are commencing the practice of\r\nexperimental inquiries in chemistry, and also to such as, having made\r\nsome progress, have indulged themselves in slovenly habits. Macquer’s\r\nobservations on this subject, as quoted by our author, are so much\r\nto the purpose, and so well deserving the serious attention of the\r\nyoung chemist, that we shall stand excused for inserting them in this\r\nplace. He says, “A persuasion must exist that arrangement, order,\r\nand cleanliness, are essentially necessary in a chemical laboratory.\r\nEvery vessel and utensil ought to be well cleansed as often it is\r\nused, and put again into its place; labels ought to be attached to\r\nall the substances, mixtures, and products of operations which are\r\npreserved in bottles or otherwise; these should be examined and\r\ncleansed from time to time, and the labels renewed when required.\r\nThese cares, although they seem to be trifling, are, notwithstanding,\r\nthe most fatiguing and tedious, but the most important, and often the\r\nleast observed. When a person is keenly engaged, experiments succeed\r\neach other quickly; some seem nearly to decide the matter, and\r\nothers suggest new ideas; he cannot but proceed to them immediately,\r\nand he is led from one to another; he thinks he shall easily know\r\nagain the products of his first experiments, and therefore he does\r\nnot take time to put them in order; he prosecutes with eagerness\r\nthe experiments which he has last thought of, and in the mean time\r\nthe vessels employed, the glasses and bottles filled, so accumulate\r\nthat he cannot any longer distinguish them; or at least he is [p282]\r\nuncertain concerning many of his former products. This evil is\r\nincreased, if a new series of operations succeed, and occupy all the\r\nlaboratory; or if he be obliged to quit the place for some time,\r\nevery thing then goes into confusion. Hence it frequently happens\r\nthat he loses the fruits of much labour, and that he must throw away\r\nalmost all the products of his experiments.\r\n\r\n “The only method of avoiding these inconveniences is to employ the\r\n cares and attentions, above mentioned. It is indeed unpleasant\r\n and very difficult continually to stop in the midst of the most\r\n interesting researches, and to employ much valuable time in cleaning\r\n and arranging vessels and attaching labels. These employments are\r\n capable of cooling and retarding the progress of genius, and are\r\n tedious and disgusting; but they are nevertheless necessary. Those\r\n persons whose fortunes enable them to have an assistant operator,\r\n on whose accuracy and intelligence they can depend, avoid many of\r\n these disagreeable circumstances; but they ought nevertheless to\r\n attend to the execution of these things. We cannot depend too much\r\n on ourselves in these matters, however minute, on account of their\r\n consequences. This becomes even indispensable when the experiments\r\n are to be kept secret, at least for a time, which is very common and\r\n often necessary in chemistry.\r\n\r\n “When new researches and inquiries are made, the mixtures, results,\r\n and products of all the operations ought to be kept a long time\r\n well ticketed and noted. It frequently happens that at the end of\r\n some time these things present very singular phenomena, which would\r\n never have been suspected. There are many beautiful discoveries\r\n in chemistry which were made in this manner, and certainly a much\r\n greater number which have been lost, because the products have been\r\n thrown away too hastily, or because they could not be recognised\r\n after the changes which happened to them.”\r\n\r\nThe uses of equivalents, and the method of employing Dr. Wollaston’s\r\nscale, form the subject of the twenty-second section of Mr. Faraday’s\r\nbook; and of the concluding sections, the twenty-third contains\r\na quantity of miscellaneous remarks, and the twenty-fourth is\r\nappropriated to “a course of inductive and instructive practices;”\r\nthat is, to a selection of minute instructions respecting the use of\r\ninstruments, and the performance of operations.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of the contents of this volume, of which we\r\nhave felt ourselves obliged to speak in terms unequivocally [p283]\r\nfavourable; in fact, it contains, strictly speaking, nothing to\r\ncriticise. It is minute, laborious, and very unpretending, and\r\ncontains a body of instructions for the performance of experiments,\r\nand of descriptions of the modes of managing and applying apparatus,\r\nwhich is not to be had elsewhere, being manifestly derived from\r\ndiligent research, extensive experience, and correct judgment. It\r\nis not a book for amateurs; for they will presently learn from it\r\nthat there is no royal road to the science of which it treats; but\r\nthe real student, who will seriously follow its laborious details,\r\nwill discover in them an acceptable and sure guide through the\r\ncrooked and intricate, as well as the straight paths of chemistry.\r\nThose, however, and those only, who are well versed in the business\r\nof the laboratory, both as experimentalists and teachers, can duly\r\nappreciate the weighty service which Mr. Faraday has here performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Statistical Notices suggested by the actual State of the British\r\n Empire, as exhibited in the last Population Census_. Communicated by\r\n Mr. Merritt.\r\n\r\n [Read before the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population returns of the _decennial lustrum_, or period of\r\nten years, which ended in 1821, were delayed for a considerable\r\ntime, on account of the difficulties which have always occurred in\r\ntaking the population of Ireland. They have now, however, been some\r\ntime completed, and from the _data_ they afford, a few reflections\r\nnaturally present themselves, which though sufficiently obvious, yet,\r\nfrom the extreme interest of the subject, may be thought deserving\r\nof being brought together, and exhibited in a connected form. They\r\npoint out some peculiarities in the situation of this country, which\r\ndistinguish it from almost every other nation that has yet existed in\r\nancient or modern times.\r\n\r\nFrom the notices which have been published respecting the different\r\ndistricts, it may be inferred, that the portion which may be termed\r\nthe _Urban_ population, has augmented in a much greater degree\r\nthan the _Rural_. The general ratio of increase has, however, been\r\nvery great, and, in the opinion of Mr. Malthus, still continues at\r\nthe same rate. That eminent [p284] economist has lately given it\r\nas his opinion, before the Emigration Committee, that the present\r\ninhabitants of the British Islands do not amount to less than\r\ntwenty-two millions and a half. This estimate is perhaps a little\r\nexaggerated; but as it may be assumed sufficiently near the truth for\r\nall the objects of general speculation, I shall proceed to point out\r\na few of those leading peculiarities, to which I have just alluded.\r\nIn the first place we may assert, I apprehend, on sufficient grounds,\r\nthat Great Britain is the most populous nation which has existed\r\nsince the Christian era. No other instance has occurred in which an\r\nextent of continuous surface of 93,000 square miles has sustained\r\na population of twenty-two millions. Italy, which is not of much\r\ngreater extent, has sometimes been rated at nearly the same amount,\r\nbut this estimate has been formed in the absence of all actual\r\nenumeration and is now ascertained to be a considerable exaggeration.\r\nNo other part of the world can enter into the competition, unless it\r\nbe certain districts of China and Japan, but which, as our knowledge\r\nof them in this respect is quite uncertain, I shall leave wholly out\r\nof the question. How far some nations of the ancient world may have\r\napproached or gone beyond us in the race of population, is perhaps\r\nequally lost in uncertainty. There is reason to believe, as I have\r\nendeavoured to demonstrate on another occasion, that some districts\r\nof the old world exceeded, in this respect, any country of modern\r\nages. Amongst them, perhaps, may be reckoned Egypt, Mesopotamia,\r\nthe lesser Asia, and some parts of Persia: but certainly, neither\r\nin ancient nor modern times do we find any instance of a single,\r\ncompact, distinct empire, exactly defined, identically governed, and\r\npeopled by twenty-two millions of souls on the same extent of soil;\r\nthis is undoubtedly a peculiarity the most striking which can exist\r\namong nations.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we may, I think, affirm with tolerable\r\ncertainty, that no nation ever contained so many large cities. On\r\nthis point Great Britain exhibits a splendid superiority. We have\r\ntwo cities of the first class, London and Dublin; the one with a\r\npopulation of more than a million, the other with little less than\r\nthree hundred thousand. Of cities of the second class, or those which\r\nreach one hundred thousand inhabitants, [p285] or above that number,\r\nwe have seven, _viz._, four in England, Manchester, Liverpool,\r\nBirmingham, Bristol; two in Scotland, Edinburgh and Glasgow; and\r\none in Ireland, the city of Cork. These seven average considerably\r\nmore than one hundred thousand each. We have fourteen towns of the\r\nthird class, or those containing from thirty to fifty thousand\r\nor upwards of inhabitants, _viz._, ten in England: Portsmouth,\r\nPlymouth, Norwich, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Bath, Newcastle,\r\nCoventry, and Hull. Two in Scotland, Paisley and Dundee, and two\r\nin Ireland, Belfast and Limerick. Of towns of the fourth class, in\r\nwhich are usually reckoned those of from fifteen to thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants, we have at least thirty, and probably more. A slight\r\nglance at the principal nations of Europe, with this view, will show\r\nat once their immense inferiority.\r\n\r\nTo begin with France, the most populous of the great sovereignties.\r\nThat empire possesses only one city of the first class, _viz._ Paris,\r\nwhich is inferior to London by one third. She has five of the second\r\nclass, _viz._, Lyons, Bourdeaux, Marseilles, Lisle and Rouen; but,\r\naccording to the latest information which I have been able to obtain,\r\nthey will not reach, by a very considerable proportion, the average\r\nnumber of the seven English cities of the same class. France has also\r\neight towns of the third class, _viz._, Amiens, Caen, Nantes, Brest,\r\nToulouse, Toulon, Mentz, and Versailles. I am not quite sure, as no\r\ncensus has lately been taken, whether two or three of the following\r\ntowns ought not to be included in this class, though I am inclined,\r\non the whole, to a contrary opinion, _viz._, Melun, Montpelier,\r\nNanci, Dijon, Tours, Rennes, and Troyes; they will not, however, I am\r\npersuaded, come near the average of the British third-rate towns. The\r\nsame remark will hold as to the number and size of the inferior towns.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the rest in rank of the great monarchies, the\r\nAustrian Empire, a very few words will suffice, as it cannot pretend\r\nto come into any competition with us, on the point in question.\r\nAustria possesses only one city of the first class, and three of the\r\nsecond, _viz._, Vienna, Prague, Milan, Venice. The towns of the third\r\nrank are proportionably few. With Spain, Russia, and Prussia, it\r\nwould be idle to enter into any comparison. [p286]\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, however, that the present kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands, as established by the congress of Vienna contains,\r\nin proportion to its extent and population, more large towns than\r\nany single state which now exists, or perhaps has ever existed.\r\nWith an extent of territory and number of inhabitants scarcely\r\nexceeding, one-fourth of the British dominions, that kingdom has one\r\ncity the first class, Amsterdam; two of the second rank, Rotterdam\r\nand Brussels; and probably as many of the third class as Great\r\nBritain herself. But the Kingdom of the Netherlands is in itself\r\ntoo insignificant to enter into any competition with such a state\r\nas Great Britain for any objects of general comparison. The various\r\nstates comprehended under the common geographical appellation of\r\nItaly, if that superb country was united under one head, is the\r\nonly one of the European nations which, under the view we are now\r\nconsidering, could sustain any parallel with Great Britain. But\r\nthis union, so desirable in many points of view, would probably\r\ndiminish its pretensions as a nation of large cities. Many of these\r\nhave reached their present grandeur and extent by having been long\r\nthe seat of a court or a government, and would perhaps decline\r\nconsiderably if reduced to the rank of mean provincial capitals. But\r\neven under any circumstances of territorial union, Italy could not\r\nbe held to comprize more than one city of the first class, _viz._,\r\nNaples, and six of the second, _viz._, Turin, Milan, Venice, Genoa,\r\nFlorence, and Rome; whereas, as we have just seen, Britain has two\r\nof the first and seven of the second, and these superior in size and\r\nnumber of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe third peculiarity which I have to remark in the actual situation\r\nof the British dominions is, that no nation ever had so great an\r\n_urban_ population, or so large a proportion of its inhabitants\r\nresiding in towns. This peculiarity is intimately connected with\r\nthat which I have just described; but it is nevertheless a very\r\ndifferent characteristic. Great Britain is not only distinguished for\r\nthe number and size of her large cities, but for having so _great_\r\na number of them on so _small_ a territory. By the census of 1811,\r\nit was found that nearly half our population resided in towns, and\r\nat present, I apprehend, the proportion will be found still greater.\r\nIn this [p287] respect no nation has ever approached us. The French\r\neconomists were of opinion that not more than one-fourth of the\r\npeople of France lived in towns; and the later statists, who have\r\nalluded to the subject, contend that a still greater proportion of\r\nthe population is rural. This will not appear exaggerated when it\r\nis recollected that all the lower classes of that country subsist\r\nprincipally on vegetable food, and that, consequently, the greater\r\npart of the soil being under tillage, a great number of hands is\r\nrequired for its cultivation. In Great Britain, on the other hand,\r\nthe inhabitants of all classes consume a great quantity of animal\r\nfood, and, of course, a great part of our lands, being in a pastoral\r\nstate, require a small proportion of occupants. In the kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands, it is supposed about one-third of the inhabitants live\r\nin towns: in Italy about one-fifth: in Austria, Spain, and Russia,\r\nexcept the province of Siberia, where the abundance of manufactures\r\ncongregates the people in masses, not more than one-fifth. In Russia,\r\nSweden, and Norway, where, amongst the lower classes, nearly every\r\nfamily is its own manufacturer, not more than one-eighth or one-ninth.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last of these peculiar characteristics which I shall\r\nremark, is, that no great nation ever employed so large a proportion\r\nof its people in trade and manufactures. In speaking thus, I leave\r\nout of the question the Italian and Flemish republics of the middle\r\nages, and the Hanse Towns, free cities, and United Provinces of later\r\ntimes. I speak only of great and extensive countries. It will appear,\r\nI doubt not, by the present census, that at least half our whole\r\npopulation is employed in trade, commerce, or manufactures. This is a\r\nfeature altogether singular; a circumstance to which no parallel can\r\nbe found in the ancient or modern world.\r\n\r\nFrom these premises, a few observations, in the way of corollaries,\r\nwill naturally suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, such a state of things is indicative of great\r\nwealth and power. A country thus situated is, beyond any other,\r\npowerful for attack and strong for defence. A profusion of great\r\ncities can only be produced by extensive trade, and can only be\r\nmaintained by a highly cultivated soil. The wealth acquired by\r\nthe industry of the towns, reacts on the [p288] industry of the\r\nagriculturist, and it is in this that the real advantages of commerce\r\nprimarily consist. In this way an extensive population is gradually\r\ngenerated, for no maxim or political economy is now more generally\r\nadmitted, than that population is sure to follow close and to press\r\nhard against the means of subsistence. An affluence of inhabitants on\r\na comparatively small territory, is, itself the primary ingredient\r\nof power, and this first requisite of strength is, in the case of\r\nGreat Britain, essentially corroborated by our insular situation.\r\nSurrounded by dangerous coasts and tempestuous seas, we can only be\r\napproached at certain points and certain times; whilst, on the other\r\nhand, as this state of things supposes and supports a powerful navy,\r\nwe are able in a great degree to choose our point of attack.\r\n\r\nFrom a population such as we have described, of which only a very\r\nlimited part is employed in creating the means of actual subsistence,\r\na very considerable portion may always be abstracted for purposes\r\nof attack or defence. It is usually calculated, that one-fifth part\r\nof the inhabitants of every country is capable of bearing arms. On\r\nthis calculation, Great Britain contains four millions of fighting\r\nmen, of whom it is believed one million might be formed into an army\r\nwithout any very serious interruption to the essential operations\r\nof agriculture and commerce. This supposition may seem a little\r\nextravagant, but it must be recollected that, at one period during\r\nthe late war, the number of men under arms was actually calculated at\r\nseven hundred and fifty thousand.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, such a state of things is favourable to public\r\nliberty. The congregation of men in great masses is found to give\r\ngreat force to the influence of public opinion; by the spirit of\r\ndiscussion which it generates; by the anxiety for intelligence which\r\nit diffuses; by the collisions of opinion which it engenders, and by\r\nthe facility of union which it affords. Nations purely or principally\r\nagricultural are generally under a despotic government, especially\r\nlarge states, for the maxim of _divide et impera_ is applicable as\r\nwell to internal as to external politics. Ancient Persia and Assyria,\r\nand modern Russia and Poland, are instances in point. The fierce\r\nand demoralizing tyranny of the feudal system, which, after [p289]\r\nthe destruction of the Roman monarchy, left scarcely any other\r\ndivision of the people than those of tyrant and vassal, could only\r\nbe effectually broken by the rise of great towns. These communities\r\nwere alone competent to resist the aristocratical and subordinate\r\ndespotisms into which all the nations of Europe were subdivided, and\r\nwhich, as is well known, overawed the throne, whilst they enslaved\r\nthe people. In confirmation of this, it may be remarked, that the\r\nfree republics of antiquity, as well as those of the middle ages,\r\nderived the spirit which nurtured them almost entirely from the\r\ncapital city; and though, in the former case, there was scarcely\r\nany commerce to excite the activity of the people, yet the mere\r\ncongregation of a numerous body of men sustained the power of public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nBut the most important question remains behind. Is a civil community\r\nthus constituted favourable to individual virtue and happiness?\r\nThis is assuredly the point which it most behoves us to ascertain,\r\nsince no truism is more obvious than that power and opulence, and\r\nrefinement and splendour, and even liberty itself, are only so far\r\nvaluable as they tend to make men wiser, and better, and happier.\r\nIs it true, then, that Great Britain has anteceded other nations in\r\nthese fundamental points, as much as in those we have just described?\r\nThis question cannot be answered without some hesitation: for we may\r\nsay, with Addison’s facetious Knight, “that a great deal may be urged\r\non both sides.” On the one hand it is certain that our situation is\r\neminently favourable to intellectual improvement. The increasing\r\nspread of instruction, and the rapid advancement of knowledge which\r\nare necessarily concurrent with our career of prosperity, must\r\nultimately advance us in the scale of moral and rational agents. If\r\nknowledge be power, it is also happiness; for communities as well as\r\nindividuals would all be happy if they knew how to be so. It is also\r\ncertain that the incessant struggles of competition and the strenuous\r\nefforts for distinction which are always at work in an over-peopled\r\nand highly refined country are favourable to the active virtues.\r\nThey operate amongst the higher classes to provide many objects of\r\nlaudable ambition; and amongst the lower, afford perpetual facilities\r\nfor bettering their condition, [p290] and furnish an incessant\r\nsupply of occupation, the want of which is sure to open the door to\r\nthe incursion of all the worst propensities and basest vices. They\r\nbring into action all the resources of human ingenuity; all the\r\naids of fortitude and enterprise; all the trials of patience and\r\nperseverance; all the equanimity demanded by the constant mutations\r\nand rotations of fortune. It is not to be denied, moreover, that the\r\nfirst-rate virtues of beneficence, charity, and hospitality, take\r\nroot and flourish with peculiar vigour in a commercial community. The\r\nfluctuations of condition to which almost every man knows himself\r\nliable, and the constant proximity of distress and opulence, offer\r\nperpetual excitements to the benevolent affections.\r\n\r\nThese, it must be confessed, are important ingredients in the\r\ncomposition of human happiness; but considerations not less momentous\r\npresent themselves on the opposite side, for every thing in human\r\naffairs is on a system of compensations. It is not to be denied\r\nthat a state of society, in which one-half of the population is\r\ncongregated in towns, and nearly a moiety of this half crowded\r\ntogether in enormous factories, is highly unpropitious to virtue, to\r\nhealth, and to happiness. In these huge receptacles of human labour,\r\nit would be absurd to expect that the women should be distinguished\r\nfor their modesty and propriety, or the men for their prudence,\r\ntemperance, and regularity. It is an unhappy law of human nature,\r\nthat the force of example is most prevalent on the side of vice. A\r\nfew depraved characters scattered amongst a multitude are commonly\r\nfound sufficient to corrupt the whole mass: hence we may always\r\nexpect to find, in the seat of a great manufactory, all the worst\r\ningredients of civilized society; all the base depravities of a\r\nluxurious and opulent community, combined with much of the grossness\r\nand rudeness of the savage state: in a word, all the corruptions of\r\nhigh civilization without any of its polish. Nor is this mode of\r\nlife, generally speaking, more favourable to health and comfort than\r\nto good morals. The constitution of the young is impaired, and their\r\ngrowth retarded by excessive labour and close confinement. Those of\r\nmaturer age are glad to seek relief from the depressing effects of a\r\nwearisome and monotonous labour, unwholesome air, and constant [p291]\r\nrestraint, in intemperate indulgence; and all the long train of\r\nvices and miseries to which the poor are liable, follows of course.\r\nNor are their prospects for the future often such as to encourage\r\nhope or stimulate exertion. The habitual improvidence of the poor\r\nis aggravated in their case by the dangerous fluctuation of their\r\ntrade. Sometimes they are eagerly courted with high wages, and lavish\r\npromises; at others, no employment is to be had, and not enough can\r\nbe earned, even by the most unnatural exertions, to sustain their\r\nfamilies. Nothing can be imagined more fatal to order, regularity,\r\nand comfort, than these vicissitudes. Hence it commonly happens,\r\nthat, in the decline of life, these poor creatures are driven to\r\nthe sad resource of parish relief. It is moreover not one of the\r\nleast evils of the manufacturing system, that it has a tendency, in\r\nprosperous times, to generate an excessive population, which, on any\r\ngreat reverse, is suddenly thrown on the community as a superfluous\r\nburden. The changes of a fashion, the caprice of public taste, or the\r\nsudden interruption of a foreign market, will reduce thousands to\r\nhelpless and unexpected poverty.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be admitted, that the picture of rural life has\r\nalso its unfavourable aspect. Those who retire into the country are\r\napt to find themselves somewhat disappointed in their expectations\r\nof rustic simplicity and pastoral innocence. In situations where\r\nevery breath of air, and every feature of nature express nothing but\r\npeace and love, they are a little surprised to see the selfish and\r\nmalignant passions at work in all their baneful activity; to find, as\r\nin the purlieus of a court, the symptoms of “envy, hatred, malice,\r\nand all uncharitableness.” Still we shall find that instances of\r\nutter depravity and abandoned profligacy are of much rarer occurrence\r\nthan in great towns. In a village, every individual is known, and the\r\nvery consciousness of being conspicuous, creates a sense of shame\r\nwhich is highly salutary. It has often been observed, that men in a\r\nbody will commit, and even justify, atrocities which no individual\r\namongst them would be capable of attempting, if not screened by the\r\nshelter of a crowd. We find, accordingly, in the annals of Wesley\r\nand Whitfield, that the great scenes of their operations are in\r\ncollieries, factories, [p292] mines, canals, and all the other\r\nappendages of a great commercial and manufacturing nation. It was\r\nthere, according to Whitfield, that the “Arch Enemy” raised his\r\ntriumphant standard; it was there, that the harvest of lost souls was\r\nripe and abundant. But the most decisive proof of the comparative\r\npurity of the rural population above that of the manufacturing\r\ndistricts, is the fact that the single town of Manchester will\r\nfurnish ten times more criminal prosecutions than two Welch counties\r\nwhich contain an equal number of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think we cannot escape the conclusion, that, though a\r\ncertain degree of commercial and manufacturing property is necessary\r\nto stimulate the agriculture of a nation, and to call forth its\r\nutmost powers of production, yet that it is not desirable that\r\nthis country should proceed much further in that dangerous career,\r\nor increase still further the disproportion between its urban and\r\nrural population. The late increase in our numbers is so rapid and\r\nalarming, that I am afraid some positive checks (to use Mr. Malthus’s\r\nlanguage) of very terrible potency must soon be brought into action.\r\nThe forcible lines of Goldsmith, though that great poet knew\r\nlittle enough of political economy, are applicable to the wise and\r\nbenovolent statesmen of all times—\r\n\r\n ’Tis theirs to judge, how wide the limits stand\r\n  Between a splendid and a happy land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _On the Modern Ornaments of Architecture, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no age since the Augustan era of Rome, perhaps, has decoration\r\nof the interior of dwellings been carried to greater excess than\r\nat present; nor, since the days of the florid style of Gothic\r\narchitecture, has the exterior received more embellishment.\r\nArchitectural ornaments have generally been copied from the antique,\r\nthose especially which belong to the orders. Indeed there is a kind\r\nof classical standard, which governs the architect in the execution\r\nof public edifices, from which he cannot with propriety depart.\r\nNational, and regal emblems, wherever suitable, should always be\r\nintroduced in public buildings, and in those of a private or mixed\r\ncharacter [p293] all legitimate ornaments may be displayed. Of\r\nthis class the acanthus, vignette, the branches of the olive, and\r\nleaves of the palm, the crown of laurel, the chaplet of myrtle, and\r\nthe wreath of roses, are all proper when judiciously introduced;\r\nand the rose and honeysuckle flowers, and the folicles, trefoils,\r\ncinquefoils, &c., which so often occur on sculpture and plaster work,\r\nare also proper, because they are imitations of nature.\r\n\r\nBut in our present style of decorative execution, from the most\r\nelaborate finishing of a regal palace, down to the pattern of a\r\nmilk-maid’s gown, there is such latitude taken in the display of\r\nlicentious fancy, that imagination itself is baffled to find anything\r\nin the infinite variety of nature’s works, to which their designs can\r\nbe compared, or to which they bear the most distant resemblance!\r\n\r\nIt is really unaccountable, that the whole tribe of our artists,\r\nthe ornamental statuary, scagliolist, paper-stainer, weaver, chintz\r\nand cotton printer, &c. should all be “straining their low thought\r\nto form unreal” forms and figures; and striking out the most\r\nintricate and complicated, to the utter neglect (except in very few\r\ninstances) of those numberless simple though transcendently beautiful\r\nconfigurations, which everywhere appear in the works of nature.\r\n\r\nThis is surely a dereliction of all propriety, an exuberance of\r\ngrovelling taste which no consideration can excuse, nor reason\r\njustify. In this age of refinement, good taste should be the guide\r\nin all things where invention is necessary, and design requisite;\r\nwhatever is grotesque or fantastic, should be banished from our\r\nlabours of art, and the elegant forms of vegetable or animal nature\r\nalone take their place.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked, how it happens that such obliquity of fancy (for\r\nit cannot be called taste) should so generally prevail, the answer\r\nis, were these pattern-mongers to copy from nature every body could\r\njudge of their ability as imitators, and, if unfaithful, would decry\r\nthe artist; whereas, whilst bringing forth his nondescript and\r\nnondescribable forms of imaginary figures, he escapes the lash of the\r\ncritic, which otherwise he would be subjected to. [p294]\r\n\r\nIt may be granted, that it is as ridiculous to form stone or plaster\r\nflowers, as those geometrical frets and fanciful nothings which\r\nare usually pourtrayed in architectural decoration: but it may be\r\nanswered that if any ornament be necessary, that of a nondescript\r\ncharacter is not more appropriate, as such, than natural forms would\r\nbe; and these latter having a name, and many of them an emblematical\r\ncharacter, may be often applied with a propriety which cannot belong\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nThe old fashioned tapestry, notwithstanding its sombre appearance,\r\nwas in its plan much more rational than the multifigurations of\r\nour modern paper hangings. The first represented some historical\r\nevent or legendary tale, yielding some mental information, or it\r\ntaught perhaps a moral lesson—the eye was amused while tracing the\r\nideas of the ingenious sempstress; but in our ephemeral and gaudy\r\nten-thousand-times repeated _paper_ nothings, there is no design to\r\ninterest, nor combination to amuse the eye longer than a transient\r\nglance. Even the Chinese, who, in all their decorative finishings\r\nshew _rigidity_ itself, have escaped from tame mannerism in paper\r\nhangings, by imitating, from the edge of the carpet to the ceiling,\r\nall the gradations of turf, herbs, shrubs, and trees, upon a sky\r\nground, enriched with figures or rather portraits of flowers and\r\nfruit, as well as beasts, birds and insects. This though it cannot\r\ndeceive the spectator for one moment in mistaking a fictitious\r\nfor a real scene, yet is certainly far superior to European\r\npaper-upholstery, as it at least may introduce a knowledge of\r\nnatural history, which the latter has no pretension to, indeed seems\r\nstudiously to discard, as beneath imitation.\r\n\r\nAll this vitiated taste, or fashion rather, is to be regretted;\r\nespecially as it appears that those\r\n\r\n Fancied forms which on the ceilings sprawl,\r\n And shapeless frets which decorate the wall,\r\n\r\nare just as expensive, and difficult of execution, as the most\r\nelegant imitation of vegetable or animal configuration would be; and\r\nsurely when such variety of forms are presented to the artist, they\r\ndeserve to be copied as transcendently superior to the capricious\r\nfancies of the most celebrated decorator, or of [p295] the most\r\nsplendid fashionable designs; either in the works of the sculptor,\r\nscagliolist, &c. or the more insignificant designers of figured paper\r\nor drapery. Indeed there can be no good reason why ox-heads and\r\ngarlands (now the days of sacrifices are past) should not be banished\r\nfrom the frieze and entablature, to admit the far more appropriate\r\nfigures of foliage, fruit, and flowers, aquatic as well as\r\nterrestrial, which every garden yields;—and for interior enrichments\r\nof cornices, mouldings, &c., the curious and elegant forms of the\r\ntestacea, would afford beautiful copies for imitation.\r\n\r\nIn fine, if there be any merit or propriety in the adaptation of\r\nwhatever is elegant in form, beautiful in outline, harmonious\r\nin tint and proportion, and congruous in combination, such may\r\nreadily be found in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Faithful\r\nrepresentations of such objects, not only open a fine field for the\r\nexercise of individual ability, at this time, but also a source\r\nfrom which might be drawn a large share of public patronage, and\r\nconsequent commensurate reward. Indeed it is now pretty evident that\r\nin many things, especially in the minor works of art, we have been\r\ntoo long and too rigidly impressed with a veneration for the works\r\nof antiquity, or what is equally benumbing, a passive following of\r\ntyrant fashion; and that many a bright genius has been “nipped in\r\nthe bud,” and remained “twinkling in the socket” of Grecian and\r\nRoman rules, who, if venturous enough to have burst the shackles of\r\nprofessional thraldom, would have improved and elevated his art, as\r\nwell as himself, by designs and works which would have advanced his\r\nprofession and adorned his country.\r\n\r\nBut it is not yet too late; a knowledge and study of the genuine\r\nelements of taste, whether of art or nature, and a mind embued with\r\nrational perceptions of all that is beautiful and picturesque, and\r\ngrand or sublime in either, will rise superior to all precedential\r\nfetters, as well as all modern mannerism, and will equally regard the\r\nexcellencies of the ancients, as it will avoid the errors of some\r\nmodern artists, who, in leaving the beaten track, have deviated far\r\nand widely from the point to which good sense and good taste would\r\nhave led. [p296]\r\n\r\nA list of plants, &c. which exemplify all that is elegant in\r\nform, beautiful in outline and graceful in position, should have\r\naccompanied the above imperfect remarks, but this must be deferred to\r\nanother opportunity.\r\n\r\n J. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _De l’Influence des Agens Physiques sur la Vie. Par_ W. F. Edwards,\r\n D. M., &c.\r\n\r\n [Continued from the last Number.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last number we presented our readers with a general abstract\r\nof the first part of this valuable work. The second part refers to\r\nanimals of the _cold blood_ order, including _fish_ and _reptiles_.\r\nThe _larvæ_ of the latter underwent some comparative experiments\r\ndetailed in the first chapter, because they partake of the nature\r\nboth of _fish_ and _reptiles_, as to their _respiratory function_;\r\nthe imperfection of their intermediate state and developement of\r\norganization not interfering with the objects in view, and the\r\ndouble mode of aërification being exercised unequally. The _skin_\r\nof these young animals furnishes them with the means of producing\r\nthe requisite changes in the blood by _absorption_, as in the\r\nadult, while it lives in water; and the cutaneous respiration goes\r\non through this medium at a temperature which the subsequent more\r\nperfect animal is unable to endure. The object entertained is the\r\ninfluence of physical agents upon the changes which these animals\r\npass through in their form and structure.\r\n\r\nAn important condition of their advancement to maturity seems to be,\r\nthat the nutriment suspended in the water should be in very small and\r\nlimited proportions. Temperature also influences their constitutional\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nSometimes the _larvæ_ pass through the winter in their primitive\r\nstate; a fact not generally known. Some _tadpoles_ were confined\r\nwithin wooden boxes submersed in the river Seine, in which holes\r\nwere perforated to allow the stream to pass through, without the\r\npossibility of the animals rising to the surface of the water, and\r\nthus to inhale air. Others were placed in a large vessel of Seine\r\nwater renewed at intervals, with power to rise above the surface.\r\nTen in twelve of the first box underwent no transformation, the\r\nothers having gone partially through their change. But [p297] those\r\nof the large vessel, and not submersed in the river, passed through\r\ntheir changes of form without the least appearance of the phenomenon\r\nbeing retarded. The running waters of the Seine probably contained\r\nnutritious matter, which the water periodically renewed was more\r\ndeficient in.\r\n\r\nUnder circumstances of moderate nourishment and temperature, the\r\ntadpoles under water did not complete their changes but in a very\r\npartial and protracted manner, while the greater portion made no\r\nchange. The great difference in the circumstances of the experiments\r\nseems to have been the access to the air of those which went\r\nthrough their transformations as usual. Exclusion from light made\r\nno difference in the results, and these were solely influenced by\r\noccasional renewal of air from pulmonary respiration.\r\n\r\nThese animals possessing a double respiration, cutaneous and\r\npulmonic, that is, absorbing air from the water around them and\r\ninhaling it from the atmosphere on its surface, renders these facts\r\nhighly curious. Fish possess only the means of aquatic respiration,\r\nand the influence of temperature was tried upon them submersed in\r\nwater deprived of its air by previous boiling, the heat being varied\r\nfrom 0° to 40°. The fish died quicker under these circumstances\r\nthan the frog species in the same situation; but their lives were\r\nprolonged more in the _descent_ of the thermometer than during its\r\n_elevation_, as also occurred with the experiments on frogs and\r\nsalamanders; and, in both cases, the younger the animal, the less it\r\ncould resist the higher temperatures. At 40° the young animals only\r\nsurvived about two minutes, and the adults many more.\r\n\r\nFish were also submersed in closed vessels of aërated water, and, by\r\nvarying the temperature and the quantities of water, the duration\r\nof their lives was augmented in proportion to the increased volume\r\nof the liquid, the temperature remaining the same; but when these\r\nexperiments were conducted in open vessels, the contact with the\r\natmosphere altered the phenomena. At 20°, a small fish expired in\r\nfour hours; and when the temperature was lowered to 10° or 12°,\r\nthe same sort of animal lived several days; and when the water was\r\nkept clean by being changed every twenty-four hours, the fish lived\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt is known that fish rise periodically to the surface of the waters\r\nto respire; and Dr. Edwards discovered that they did so when they\r\nhave reduced the properties of the air [p298] dissolved in the water\r\nto a lower standard than is requisite for the proper aërification of\r\ntheir blood; thus renewing their supply of _oxygen_.\r\n\r\nThe functions of this class of animals have always been obscure; and\r\ntheir phenomena are different from those of others. Different species\r\nof fish die at various periods when deprived of water, some in a few\r\nminutes, others in a few hours; and it appears that their dissolution\r\narises not so much from incapability of atmospheric respiration (for\r\nthe experiments of Sylvester prove that they can respire pure air),\r\nas from the different state of the air.\r\n\r\nSome experiments on _lizards_, _snakes_, and _turtles_ conclude the\r\nresearches among cold-blooded animals. The skins of these, like those\r\nof the frogs and salamanders, received vivifying influence from\r\nthe air, mainly acting, in conjunction with pulmonary respiration,\r\nto promote their existence. _Snakes_ and _turtle_, their pulmonary\r\nrespiration being insulated, from their skins being guarded from\r\natmospheric influence, were found alive; but the _lizards_ died\r\nin a few hours, when the vivifying contact of the air was removed\r\nfrom their bodies, and they breathed only by their mouths. Animals\r\nnaturally defended by _scales_ transpire much less than such as have\r\ntheir skins free. Thus _frogs_, _toads_, and _salamanders_ yielded\r\nmore by perspiration than _lizards_, _snakes_, and _turtle_, in a\r\ngiven time; and the porosity of the skin of course regulates the\r\nfacility of transpiration in all cases.\r\n\r\nWith these experiments and remarks, Dr. Edwards concludes the second\r\npart of his researches. The third part includes _animals of warm\r\nblood_, in which will be found some curious and interesting remarks\r\non the heat of young animals compared with that of adults.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards refutes the common notion of young animals being\r\nnecessarily hotter than adults. The heat of young puppies was very\r\nnear that of the parent, or one or two degrees less, but this\r\nvariation was not constant. Some new-born kittens and rabbits were\r\nalso subjected to similar trials, and the results led to a conclusion\r\nthat the temperature of young animals is _less_ than that of adults.\r\n\r\nAccording to these experiments, the power of resisting the cooling\r\ninfluence of the air acquires force as the animal grows up; and those\r\nexamples related, in which artificial covering was adopted, show that\r\nnudity is not the only cause of the reduction of heat, which is,\r\nin fact, more referrible [p299] to their infantile constitution.\r\nAt first the sucking animal shows little variation from the parent\r\ntemperature; then this becomes more and more reduced, and about the\r\nfifteenth day it is a degree or two below the mother.\r\n\r\nBirds, which are warmer than mammiferæ, were next made the objects\r\nof experimental inquiry, and the young recently hatched exhibited\r\na _lower_ temperature than the grown birds. After removal from the\r\nshelter of their nests into a mild atmosphere of 17°, in one hour\r\nthey cooled down from 36° to 19°, thus losing 17° in an hour. At an\r\nelevation of 22° the same results were obtained, and they cooled down\r\nto within one degree of the surrounding air. The plumage of birds\r\nhas little if any influence upon their temperature. The production\r\nof heat lies within, and not on the surface of the animal; and if\r\nit be strongly developed, the removal of natural coverings does not\r\ninfluence the heat produced; and if it be weak, their addition will\r\nnot prevent cooling. Birds recently escaped from the shell cooled\r\nto within two degrees of the air, whereas the unplumed adult birds\r\nscarcely lost one degree.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive character of warm-blooded animals to preserve an\r\nuniformity of heat has no reference to _bulk_. The _eagle_ maintains\r\nthe same temperature as the _wren_ or the _tom-tit_, taking them at\r\nthe same age, and placing them under the same circumstances; but if\r\ncooling measures be adopted, the lesser body parts with its heat\r\nfaster than the larger, though ultimately they arrive at the same\r\npoint. The dimensions of animals are infinitely varied; but the giant\r\nreaches no higher standard than the dwarf, nor sinks to a lower\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the temperature of young animals, it must be taken\r\ninto account that they are born at different periods of organic\r\ndevelopement. Some come earlier into the world than others, and\r\nsome are more perfectly formed than others at their birth, and more\r\ncapable of helping themselves. This variation produces a different\r\nstandard of heat after birth, and especially creates a variety of\r\ntemperature among birds when tested at the same epochs of their\r\nexistence. The season in which animals are produced also modifies\r\ntheir temperature.\r\n\r\nThe influence of age in modifying temperature is common both to\r\nmammiferæ and birds. Young and healthy sucking pigs cooled faster\r\nthan their parent, their generating means of heat being more feeble.\r\nAnimals of warm blood possess [p300] the power of supplying heat at\r\nits _maximum_ when first born; they then part with it by degrees,\r\nand, as they advance in age, their heat becomes gradually augmented\r\nagain till it reaches the adult standard.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards next proceeds to discuss the phenomena of animal\r\ntemperature more exclusively regarding adults, and especially among\r\nthose singular creatures of the mammiferæ which form an exception to\r\nthe general law of nature respecting the uniformity of temperature\r\nas to warm-blooded animals. These beings are what are termed\r\n_hybernants_, such as the _dormouse_, the _hedgehog_, the _bat_, the\r\n_marmot_, &c., natives of Europe; which remain dormant during winter\r\nwithout any external signs of life and motion. The change which\r\nthese undergo reduces them from the state of warm-blooded animals to\r\nthat of cold. Unlike the rest of their class, the autumnal season\r\nlowers their temperature by degrees, till in winter it reaches so\r\nlow as to be scarcely higher than the surrounding air. Their powers\r\nfail gradually, and their losses of heat are not repaired, till at\r\nlength their respirations become slow and feeble, and the heart\r\nlanguidly urges the blood through the arteries. In this state there\r\nis an imperfect aërification of the blood, and a partial state of\r\nasphyxia, producing continued repose of the nervous and muscular\r\nsystem. But the temperature of these animals sinks no lower than\r\nthe air, and remains sufficient to maintain a passive existence,\r\ntill the returning spring raises their heat again, and they become\r\nlively and active till autumn; but even in spring these animals are\r\ncharacterised by producing less heat than others of their class.\r\n\r\nIf we seek to know the cause of this curious variety, we can only\r\nrefer it to peculiarity of constitution, which is instituted by\r\nnature as adapted to animals placed in situations of rigorous cold,\r\nand where they cannot procure sustenance but in spring and summer.\r\n\r\nOur author imitated the process of hybernation by artificial cold,\r\nand produced the same effects; and when he restored animation by\r\ngradual warmth, he found the animals as lively as before.\r\n\r\nJohn Hunter and others have written on the natural history of\r\nhybernants, and Dr. Edwards regards only their temperature. The\r\nexperiments on hybernants by artificial cold prove this fact, that\r\nhybernation is attributable to other causes than to the reduction and\r\ndeprivation of nutriment; for the animals submitted to the ordeal\r\nof cold were well [p301] fed, and in the lively season of advanced\r\nspring. The deprivation of food seems to be a local consequence\r\nprovided for by the phenomenon of hybernation, and not its exciting\r\ncause. Nor does there appear to be any change of organization in\r\nthese cases, but a state of constitution exists which we are unable\r\nto account for further.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the next place, a series of experiments showing the\r\ninfluence of the _seasons_ upon animal temperature with the\r\nwarm-blooded; by which it seems that they produce a variety of\r\nresults: and it is demonstrated that animals of warm blood in general\r\nundergo some constitutional changes with the periodical returns of\r\nthe seasons. When, for example, the highest degree of temperature is\r\nattained, animals no longer produce heat; so that their temperature\r\ncontinues below that of the air in the hot season. And, in the cold\r\nseason, if the cold be not too rigorous, the animal’s age offers\r\na proportionate resistance to the cooling effects of the air as\r\nthe approach to maturity is attained. An elevated and a depressed\r\ntemperature thus produce contrary effects upon the internal powers\r\nof generating animal heat, a high temperature arresting them, and a\r\nlow one promoting them. _Thus we cannot fail to observe the beautiful\r\nadaptation of means to final causes_.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of _asphyxia_ in warm-blooded animals, Dr. Edwards\r\nfound a great dependence between animal heat and the faculty of\r\nliving without contact with the air, a state in which the blood is\r\nnot aërated by respiration, and which is sustained by hybernants\r\nwhile in the dormant condition. Having submersed animals in water\r\nof various temperatures successively, so as to bring them under the\r\ninfluence of variable temperature, he found the _descending_ scale\r\nof temperature the most hurtful. The _ascending_ heat was that which\r\nprolonged life most. Between 20° and 10° the results were similar to\r\nthose between 20° and 40°.\r\n\r\nAnimals, then, of warm blood in a state of asphyxia hold their\r\nexistence on two principal conditions relative to heat; one regarding\r\nthe different measures by which some develope their heat, and the\r\nother the degree of external temperature. The first is proper to\r\nanimals naturally, the second fortuitous.\r\n\r\nUpon the _respiration_ of both young and adult animals the author\r\narrives at a conclusion opposite to that of common opinion, which is\r\nfounded on the notion of the heat in young animals being higher than\r\nthat of the matured. Finding, [p302] however, as already noticed,\r\nthat the parent exceeds the temperature of its offspring after\r\nbirth, it is naturally concluded that its consumption of air is also\r\ngreatest. This was experimentally confirmed, and is in unison with\r\nother facts. In the first part of this work the vertebratæ of cold\r\nblood were also found to consume least air in proportion to their\r\ndiminution of temperature. Temperature seems to act uniformly with\r\nall the vertebratæ, and their consumption of air is in proportion.\r\nThe _mammiferæ_ have a lower temperature than _birds_, and they\r\nconsume less air than the latter. Fish and reptiles consume less air\r\nthan the warm-blooded, and possess a lower temperature.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the _seasons_ upon _respiration_ is considered\r\nin the sixth chapter. Many changes occur in the atmosphere during\r\nthe revolutions of the seasons, varieties in the temperature, and\r\nthe pressure and density of the air. Dr. Edwards shows that the\r\nfaculty of producing heat with warm-blooded animals is greater in\r\n_winter_ than in _summer_, the constitution of animals being adapted\r\nto their individual climates; and in reference to the relation of\r\nthis faculty to the consumption of air, it is presumable, all other\r\ncircumstances being alike, that the consumption ought to be increased\r\nwith the faculty of developing heat, and the experiments justify the\r\npresumption.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of _transpiration_, it is shown that the air not\r\nonly exercises a vivifying effect upon the constitution, but one\r\nlittle less important in removing a vaporous substance from the\r\nsurface of the body, and which is separated from the fluids before\r\nits conversion into vapour, and known by the name of perspiration\r\nor sweat, which transpires from the skin. The variations in the\r\ntemperature of the air possess great influence over this function.\r\nExperiments on this subject were detailed most fully in our last\r\nNumber, relative to cold-blooded animals; and therefore these need\r\nnot now be repeated in respect to the warm-blooded, for the results\r\nare exactly similar, as to transpiration in equal and successive\r\nperiods, the comparative influence of dry and moist states of the\r\nair, and the effects of air in motion and in repose. Inspection of\r\nthe table annexed to the work displays the similarity of the effects\r\nproduced by the same physical agents upon cold and warm blooded\r\nanimals, and this accordance serves to afford mutual support to the\r\ndifferent investigations.\r\n\r\nWe are now arrived at the fourth and last part of this [p303] work.\r\nMuch, however, of this part appertains to what has been already\r\ndetailed upon other animals. But the modifications of heat in the\r\nhuman being, from the period of birth to maturity, will be found\r\nhighly interesting. They accord precisely with the results obtained\r\namong the lower animals and mammiferæ; and present analogical proofs\r\nof the general application of principles laid down in the preceding\r\nportions of our notices.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, we trace analogy throughout the animal kingdom, it\r\nmust be remembered that there are infinite sources of variation\r\narising from the extensive variety of species modifying those\r\nprinciples, which are governed by a general harmony of effect. Of\r\nall animals, man exhibits this variety the most, possessing, as\r\nhe does, attributes above all the groups of his class, from his\r\nintellectual properties, speech, &c., rendering his race unique and\r\nsuperior to all others. Our curiosity cannot, therefore, be allowed\r\nto rest satisfied with the general application of principles,\r\nuntil we have observed their modifications in the human being as\r\nwell as in brutes. It is highly interesting to inquire into the\r\nconditions of human phenomena, and examine the forces which man\r\nopposes in his intelligent character to the physical agents around\r\nhim. He is equally liable to their influence, exists by their\r\ncontact, and yields, like other members of the animal kingdom, to\r\ntheir destructive tendency. The essential distinctions appertaining\r\nto his economy are thus the more necessary to be understood. His\r\n_organization_ affords him no shelter from the operations of physical\r\nlaws beyond that of brutes; but the superiority of his nature may\r\nbe supposed to modify their influence from causes referrible to his\r\n_sensibility_. These have formed the subject of Dr. Edwards’s inquiry.\r\n\r\nMan’s state and condition, at his birth, place him in very different\r\ncircumstances from those at which he subsequently arrives. Here,\r\ntherefore, we see an extensive field of inquiry; and it is suggested\r\nwhether, in the infantile state, man generates _less heat_ than in\r\nmore matured existence. Dr. Edwards has shown that the young of\r\nmammiferæ generally, being born at the period when their eyes are\r\nopen, produce _less_ heat than adults. It is, therefore, presumable\r\nthat the generating powers of heat differ in the two states of\r\nexistence which man goes through, the infantile and mature.\r\n\r\nBut the power of producing heat differs among adult animals, and it\r\nis desirable to know the limits of this faculty, [p304] Moreover,\r\nthis power differs in different parts of the body; so that, when\r\nexperiments are made, we should always apply the thermometer to\r\nthe same part of the body. Among twenty adult persons, Dr. Edwards\r\nfound the average temperature 36°.12: in infants from a few hours\r\nto two days old, 34°.75 was the average. Thus we perceive that the\r\ntemperature of human infants is _inferior_ to that of adults. In\r\ninfants born previous to the usual period, two or three hours after\r\nbirth their heat was at 32° of Reaumur’s scale. So far we perceive a\r\nsimilarity in man to the mammiferæ in general.\r\n\r\nWe have next a chapter on the effects of _cold_ upon mortality at\r\ndifferent ages. It is highly interesting to observe the care of\r\nanimals towards their offspring, in protecting them against the\r\neffects of cold instinctively at a period before their own powers of\r\ngenerating heat enable them to resist its baneful tendency.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwards endeavours to investigate the subject of cold, so as to\r\ndiscover its limit of action. He examined the young of mammiferæ and\r\nbirds, the former born with closed eyes, and the latter unfledged.\r\nHe exposed them separately and apart to the air, so as to be\r\nindependent of each other’s warmth, and they exhibited a temperature\r\nbelow their natural standard at the period of birth, even when a\r\ndegree of artificial heat was applied beyond that of adult birds.\r\nThe final result of these experiments was, that the application of\r\nheat may be conducive to their developement, but is not indispensable\r\nto their preservation. The author discovered, that the diminution\r\nof temperature is not equally injurious at all ages. The _younger_\r\nthe animal, the _less_ is the injury sustained by cold, because the\r\nfaculty of producing heat is less powerful with the young than with\r\nthe matured animal, the power increasing as the animal grows, and\r\nalso with the increase of cold.\r\n\r\nStill, however, this subject is open to inquiry, for the great\r\nvariety of species, and other circumstances belonging to the animal\r\ncreation, so modify the phenomena as to create an almost endless\r\nfield of investigation. When warm-blooded animals are exposed by\r\ntheir parents to the atmospheric influence at an early age, they\r\nare better provided against the perils of cold, being born with an\r\nabundant source of heat. But, if the cold exceeds their powers of\r\ngenerating heat, the mortality is so much readier. Hence arises\r\nthe danger of animals being born in the winter season. [p305] Two\r\ncircumstances are distinguishable, the refrigeration of the body,\r\nand the temperature it is capable of sustaining. The cooling is so\r\nmuch less injurious with the young. If two young animals of the same\r\nspecies be cooled down equally, the youngest suffers the least. But,\r\nin order to lower to the same number of degrees the temperature of\r\nbodies of different ages, the external heat should be lowered in\r\nproportion to the advancement of the animal towards maturity, in\r\norder to compensate for the difference which the modification of age\r\nproduces.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the younger animals suffer least from cold,\r\nit is, at the same time, to be considered that they cool down more\r\nrapidly. On this principle depends the mortality of our domestic\r\nfowls and other animals, the management of which requires so much\r\nobservation and experience in order to rear them. In regions where\r\nthe temperature is liable to great alterations in the course of the\r\nyear, man and other vertebrated animals of warm blood are liable\r\nto suffer in their health; for, though _cold_ should produce the\r\nresistance derived from the necessary constitutional developement of\r\nheat, this increase of caloric, having its limits, often exposes the\r\nconstitution to the effects of too great reduction of temperature, as\r\nis exemplified in the frozen regions of the North Pole, in Siberia,\r\nand in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe young of mammiferæ, in general, were found by Dr. Edwards to\r\ndiffer very materially in the duration of their lives, in a state\r\nof asphyxia, often being limited to from five to eleven minutes,\r\naccording to their developement at birth, the most advanced in\r\norganization living the longest period. The author proved these facts\r\nby placing animals in a state of asphyxia under water; and it is\r\nremarkable that, in all his experiments, the _voluntary_ motions were\r\nalways first destroyed, the _involuntary_ outliving them. With dogs,\r\ncats, and rabbits, sensibility existed only three or four minutes. A\r\npuppy showed _automatic_ signs of life nearly half an hour. The best\r\ndivers appear to be able to remain under water from three to four\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nWhen animals are entirely deprived of aërial contact, it may be\r\ninquired, what are the principal functions exercised? When the air\r\ncirculates through the lungs, it imparts to the blood a peculiar\r\nquality, by which its colour becomes changed. Deprived of this\r\ninfluence from the air, the blood acquires a dark colour, and\r\nthe _nervous function_ is [p306] simultaneously affected. Among\r\n_reptiles_, Dr. Edwards found that life could be maintained by this\r\ndark blood; but it is questionable whether the circulation of venous\r\nor dark blood can promote life in animals of the warm-blooded kind.\r\nTemperature certainly modifies their capability of existence. Under\r\n20°, they live longest; at 0°, their existence is shortest. The\r\nvitality of the nervous system seems to be thus directly influenced\r\nby temperature.\r\n\r\nOf all the phenomena of animal life, those relative to the blood’s\r\nstate in asphyxia are, perhaps, the most interesting and curious,\r\nfrom loss of consciousness, sensation, and voluntary motion attending\r\nits disoxygenated state. If, however, animals differ so materially\r\nunder the influence of a deprivation of air, as to the duration of\r\nsuch existence, we may imagine a corresponding difference relative to\r\ntheir respirations modified by species, age, &c. Air, the _pabulum\r\nvitæ_, is not equally consumed by all, but in different proportions;\r\nat least, such is the presumption from the experiments upon animals\r\nof warm blood. The relative proportions of this difference are sought\r\nto be ascertained. Warm-blooded animals of equal size and age, at\r\ntheir liveliest period of age, were the objects of comparative\r\ninquiry. We must refer the reader to the table at the end of the\r\nwork for the results. A marked difference is observable between\r\nthe quantity of air consumed by the cold-blooded animals and that\r\nrequired for the support of the warm-blooded; and each has an\r\norganization appropriated to the individual distinctions. Thus the\r\nstructure of the reptile and fish entails the lesser consumption of\r\nair, compared with that of the mammiferæ and birds. Fish consume\r\nleast air, reptiles stand next, then the mammiferæ, and, lastly,\r\nbirds consume most. The two last, however, very nearly approach\r\neach other; so do also the two first; and the distinction between\r\nthe organization and the consumption of air is most strongly marked\r\nbetween the fish and reptiles on the one hand, and the mammiferæ and\r\nbirds on the other, which, indeed, has caused their separation into\r\ntwo distinct groups, by the appellation of _cold_ and _warm blooded\r\nanimals_,—a distinction which clearly separates the whole of the\r\nvertebrated animals into two groups, bearing different physiological\r\ncharacters in their relations to animal heat and respiration.\r\n\r\nThe mere temperature of the blood in each group is insufficient for\r\nour knowledge of their distinctive characters. We [p307] further\r\nfind them characterised by a consumption of air in union with their\r\nheat, so as to unite these two functions, and thus render them\r\ndependent upon the same organs. Dr. Edwards has further shown, that\r\nfrom birth to maturity the production of heat goes on increasing\r\nwith the consumption of air. And thus age (as well as the seasons)\r\nhas been shown to be a modifier of animal heat; for, as the hot\r\nseason advances, the consumption of air becomes diminished, and when\r\nthe cold sets in, it increases; and this decrease and increase are\r\naccompanied by corresponding developements of heat.\r\n\r\nIn cases of fainting, of hysteric and asthmatic fits, the principle\r\nhere laid down, as to the balance between the air consumed and heat,\r\nis instinctively acted upon by the most ignorant persons, who open\r\nall the doors and windows to admit cold air, and dash cold water in\r\nthe patient’s face. The addition or continuance of heat increases the\r\naffection. The application of cold produces instant relief. The state\r\nof asphyxia is relieved, the senses return, the pulse beats at the\r\nwrist, and the respiration goes on naturally. The _cooling_ renders\r\nthe air, unfit before, fitted for the purposes of life.\r\n\r\nThe effects of temperature upon the respiratory movements are\r\nindicated also in those constitutional changes which diminish the\r\nproduction of heat and the consumption of air. Organic affection\r\nof the heart or lungs may produce this change, which entails the\r\nnecessity of a change of climate, or an alteration of temperature\r\nartificially, to restore the balance between the air and the animal\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nA very elaborate and complete argument, and series of experiments,\r\nare devoted to the subject of _transpiration_, and the effect upon it\r\nof the influence derived from repose of the body and sleep, by the\r\nair’s motion or stillness, and by the pressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, pursued the interesting points touched upon\r\nso far as to render it impossible to enter at present upon this\r\nportion of the work. The importance of the subject demands a fuller\r\ninvestigation and report than we have now room for; and we must,\r\ntherefore, defer it to another opportunity. [p308]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Experiments on_ THOUGHT. By a Correspondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a very common prejudice respecting the rapidity of thought,\r\nwhich is imagined by many to be almost unlimited: and the opinion\r\nis very worthily illustrated by a reference to the oriental tale of\r\na man’s being bewitched into the belief that he had passed through\r\na period of seven years duration, and full of the most striking\r\nvicissitudes; all in the time that he employed in dipping his head\r\nin a pail of water. Now there is no doubt that we often dream of a\r\nperiod of many years while we are only sleeping an hour; that is, we\r\ndream of an impression of a long continued existence, or perhaps of\r\nsome detached fact scattered through such a period: but if any person\r\nwill write down all that he can possibly recollect, of the separate\r\nimaginations that have passed through his mind in the dream, he will\r\nfind that he will be able to read them over with ease in less than\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there may be considerable diversity in the\r\nrapidity of thought in different persons, as there is in that of\r\nmuscular motions: but there is no reason to think the diversity\r\ngreater. A healthy young man can run a mile in five minutes: a good\r\npedestrian in four; but no man ever ran a mile in three minutes;\r\nand perhaps no horse in two. There is reason to think the rapidity\r\nof thought does not differ more materially than this in different\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of thought seems, however, more intimately connected\r\nwith that of muscular motion than by analogy only: for they appear in\r\nsome cases to be absolutely identical.\r\n\r\nI have often been able to count ten in a second, in audible English\r\nwords; not distinctly, indeed, but so as to assure myself that I do\r\nhear the ten words in their proper order; and to repeat the sounds\r\nfor several consecutive seconds. If I say the words _to myself_ only,\r\nthat is, if I think them over, I cannot repeat them ten times in less\r\nthan about nine seconds: I can never, for example, keep pace with my\r\npulse, though it sometimes beats as slowly as seventy in a minute:\r\nnor can I, by any effort, think over the numbers from one to twenty\r\nin two seconds.\r\n\r\nIf I say to myself the first lines of Milton or Virgil, or [p309]\r\nHomer, or any other lines that may be still more familiar to me,\r\nI cannot get through them much, if at all, more rapidly than I can\r\npronounce them, even when I fix my undivided attention on them.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of sensation is also intimately connected with that\r\nof memory and of muscular action. To cast the eye over a sentence,\r\nattending to every letter, is an operation which is capable of equal\r\nrapidity with the saying it over mentally: but it cannot be made much\r\nmore rapid. It required four seconds to look over a sentence which\r\noccupied six in rapid reading.\r\n\r\nThe operations, which succeed each other with this limited rapidity,\r\nare not incompatible with a partial attention to other subjects: just\r\nas in running or walking, we may have our feelings very strongly\r\ninterested by the sight of surrounding objects without interrupting\r\nthe train of voluntary motions, which seems thus to be so linked\r\ntogether in a continued chain, as to become almost involuntary. And\r\nwe may certainly be saying a thing over as rapidly as possible to\r\nourselves, and may at the same time be seeing, and hearing, and even\r\nreasoning, so as to keep up what amounts very nearly, though not\r\ncompletely, to a continuity of attention to several distinct trains\r\nof ideas: in the same manner as the nerves of involuntary action\r\nare notoriously employed in several distinct trains of concatenated\r\nmuscular motions and vascular actions, and as the ear of a musician\r\nis able to follow and retain a dozen different melodies in harmony\r\nwith each other at the same time.\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin mentions an experiment which has a similar tendency to\r\nshow the close connexion between thought and sensation. He says, that\r\nif we think intensely of a deep colour, for instance red, with the\r\neyes closed, we shall see a tinge when we open them of the opposite\r\ncolour, or green; just as if we had actually looked at a red colour\r\ninstead of thinking of it. But I confess that I have never been able\r\nto satisfy myself completely of the success of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThese very hasty observations appear to me to be in great measure\r\noriginal; and the results of such experiments are certainly more\r\ncalculated to illustrate the nature and powers of the human\r\nmind, than the fanciful hypothesis of the fashionable [p310]\r\ncraniologists, with all their measurements of the heads of\r\nmurderers, are likely to become.\r\n\r\n ZMINIS.\r\n _London_, 20 _Oct._ 1827.\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.—I find that some similar remarks have been made by the\r\nlate Sir William Watson, in his Treatise on Time. He estimated,\r\nfrom some experiments made in company with his friend Herschel, the\r\ngreatest possible velocity of sensation, such as to admit of about\r\nthree hundred distinct impressions on the eye or the ear in a second.\r\n“It is true,” he observes, “that whoever attends to what passes\r\nin his imagination on particular occasions, will be struck at the\r\napparent rapidity with which ideas appear to flow at times, and will\r\nbe apt to suspect them far to exceed sensation in that respect. But\r\nit is probable that we are ourselves deceived in such cases.” P. 38.\r\nBut there are no direct experiments to prove this opinion. On the\r\nother hand, a sound may be continuous, and yet consist of only about\r\ntwenty vibrations, or still fewer, in a second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n HIEROGLYPHICAL _Fragments, illustrative of Inscriptions preserved\r\n in the_ BRITISH MUSEUM, _with some remarks on_ Mr. CHAMPOLLION’s\r\n _opinions_. In _a Letter to the Cavaliere_ SAN QUINTINO. By a\r\n Correspondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n My dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou will be glad to hear that I have made some little progress in\r\nstudy of the Enchorial inscriptions which I had lately the pleasure\r\nof showing you: my steps have, as usual, been guided by no _system_\r\nwhatever: they have been wholly _empirical_, and though very slow, I\r\ntrust they are so much the more sure: and I hope they will at least\r\nserve as an excuse for my reminding you of the expectations you\r\nkindly allowed me to entertain, that you would send me copies of any\r\nthing of the kind that you might find among the objects entrusted\r\nto your care at Turin. What I have lately done has only been to\r\nascertain the dates of many of the tablets sent by Mr. Salt [p311]\r\nfrom Sacchara, all of them about the time of the last Cleopatra:\r\nto identify the Enchorial name of Ptolemy DIONYSUS, and to make\r\nout a passage relating to a donation of MUCH GOLD AND SILVER AND\r\nGEMS TO THE SANCTUARY OF THE GREAT GOD AT MEMPHIS. The different\r\nforms of the characters employed by the writers, in the same words,\r\nconstitute also a valuable addition to be means of deciphering any\r\nnew inscriptions of a similar nature, and I have already incorporated\r\nmany of them with my little Enchorial Dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe 48th and 49th plates of the Hieroglyphics, already published,\r\ncontain two tablets, apparently funerary, but without any dates of\r\nthe reigns: the ages of the persons seem to be expressed in the\r\nhieroglyphical lines. In the 49th we find the name Berenice twice in\r\nthe Enchorial letters, and once in hieroglyphics; followed here by\r\nArsinoe, possibly as her mother.\r\n\r\nThis tablet, coarse as it is, abundantly shows that Horapollo and\r\nChampollion are both correct, independently, as it seems, of each\r\nother, in considering the rings, or cartouches, as chiefly confined\r\nto the names of royal personages; and that I inferred the contrary\r\nsomewhat too hastily, from observing that the _imitations_ of those\r\nrings were attached in the Enchorial inscription of Rosetta, to\r\nseveral names not royal, and from having found such rings in other\r\nhieroglyphical inscriptions, without the usual epithets of kings.\r\nI had, indeed, remarked, that a “mysterious” name was _sometimes_\r\nobservable in the manuscripts without a ring, and I had pointed out\r\nthe same group as _a_ name in Lord Mountnorris’s manuscript, which\r\nMr. Champollion considers as the true name: but I am perfectly ready\r\nto admit that Mr. Champollion has materially _improved_ on this hint,\r\nas he has on many others.\r\n\r\nThe same line of hieroglyphics, however, contributes to add to my\r\nreluctance in admitting Mr. Champollion’s reading of P.T.H; a group\r\nwhich I considered as very probably representing these letters\r\nlong before the date of his publications; though I had only fully\r\nidentified the two first characters; it seems to me to agree better\r\nwith PETEH than with PHTAH; and I am inclined to think it was the\r\nbeginning of the names Petosiris, Peteharpocrates, and other similiar\r\nwords, [p312] as it is here annexed to the names of two or three\r\nother deities. But I am by no means confident on the subject; and\r\nbeg only to be allowed a few years more to collect further evidence,\r\nwithout being accused of _resisting_ conviction.\r\n\r\nI must also claim a similar indulgence for my opinion respecting\r\nthe bird and the disc; which is so constantly found between two\r\nnames, that I could not avoid supposing it to mean simply _son_; I\r\nconfess that the arguments which Mr. Champollion has drawn from the\r\napplication of this character to some of the Roman names, as well as\r\nthose which Mr. Salt has deduced from the inscriptions which he has\r\npublished, are at least sufficient to silence me; I had, indeed, long\r\nbefore observed that the first name of one pair of rings scarcely\r\never found as the second of another, though I fancied the Minervean\r\nobelisk might afford an exception. On the other hand, I cannot\r\nexplain, upon Mr. Champollion’s theory, the order of the names in\r\nthe tablet of Abydus, which might be supposed to have been purposely\r\nintended to perpetuate this discussion.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that this tablet contains the names of a chronological\r\nseries of kings, each characterized by one ring, containing what I\r\nhave always considered as the true names of the persons in question.\r\nIt is easy to grant to him that they are the praenomens only; as is\r\ncommon in all modern chronology. But how comes it that there is one\r\nexception to this, and that the reigning monarch is characterized\r\nby his second name only, where he first occurs, and where we should\r\nexpect to find his father? This is precisely what would have been\r\nrequired if the document had been forged to support my opinion;\r\nthough I should certainly have been very ungrateful for an argument,\r\nwhich is more calculated to increase the difficulty than to remove it.\r\n\r\nAn objection of a similar nature may be deduced from the tablet found\r\nbetween the legs of the sphinx, and copied by Mr. Salt, H. 80. The\r\n“Mesphres son of Thuthmosis” of the Article Egypt is represented\r\nnaturally enough as doing homage to his deified father, under the\r\nform of an Androsphinx; had he been doing homage to himself, the\r\nnames would scarcely have been so divided. They also occur repeatedly\r\nafterwards in the inscription, but never together. [p313]\r\n\r\nThe tablet represented in Plate 51, is remarkable for the\r\nconfirmation which its date affords of the accuracy of our chronology\r\nof the Ptolemies. It has no _pure_ hieroglyphics. It begins\r\nimmediately with “_The year 19, otherwise 4, of Cleopatra [Neotera],\r\nand Ptolemy surnamed Caesar_: that is, the year 34 B. C.; and the\r\nsame date is repeated in a form somewhat more distinct, four times,\r\nin the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 15th lines. In the last it is followed\r\nby _the Queen gave to the Priests and High Priests_ . . then _Ptolemy\r\n[Auletes?] . . Queen Cleopatra and King Ptolemy surnamed Caesar_.\r\n\r\nIt has before been observed, that the word _surnamed_, as it occurs\r\nin these tablets, and in Mr. Grey’s manuscripts, comprehends the\r\ncharacters which answer to the NEO of Mr. Champollion’s NEOCAESARIS.\r\nThe beginning of the group occurs elsewhere in the sense of _called_,\r\nand can scarcely be read “ETO,” whether we consider the sacred or\r\nthe enchorial characters; nor do we find any thing nearer to this in\r\nCoptic than ETE, meaning “_that is_,” while the characters are more\r\nlike TENE. Such are the uncertainties which continually beset us in\r\nthe application of the best established alphabetical characters even\r\nto words of which we know the sounds: to investigate the unknown by\r\nthem is at present almost hopeless.\r\n\r\nThere are two tablets, from the caverns at Sacchara, about to appear\r\nin Plates 70 to 74 of the Hieroglyphics, which Mr. Salt sent over\r\nwith particular interest, as being likely to contain some useful\r\nmaterials for the comparison of the different kinds of characters\r\nwith each other. In this point of view, however, his well-directed\r\nzeal has failed of its object: for the sacred characters relate\r\nalmost entirely to the gods and priests of the temple, while the\r\nenchorial inscriptions below them contain dates and records of the\r\nsuccessive donations made to those temples. And this seems to be\r\nequally true of the generality of double inscriptions, which are\r\nscarcely ever identical in this sense, although they may greatly tend\r\nto illustrate each other.\r\n\r\nThe first in order of these tablets (H 70, 71, 74 A) was marked\r\nnumber 50 by Mr. Salt; it has seven stars at the edge of the wings\r\novershadowing the figures. It is first dated very distinctly _In the\r\nyear 6 of Cleopatra_; which ought to have [p314] been 6 _otherwise_\r\n2; but the second date was perhaps omitted after an interval of more\r\nthan 20 years, which must have elapsed at the time of putting up the\r\ntablet, as the subsequent dates demonstrate. The queen seems to be\r\nstyled _Isis_, but the name of the “younger goddess,” which is found\r\non her medals, does not appear in these inscriptions. In the 4th line\r\nthe word _Memphis_ occurs, though less distinctly than elsewhere.\r\nIt seems to be formed of characters meaning _Temple_, and _Good_,\r\nand might naturally be read PHE-NUF; which agrees sufficiently well\r\nwith the NOPH of Jeremiah, translated Memphis by the Septuagint, as\r\nwell as with the Coptic PANUF, said to have been _Momemphis_. It is\r\npossible that Phthah may have been meant by the Good god, NUF; but\r\nthere is here no character at all resembling the Enchorial name of\r\nPhthah, which approaches to that of a figure of 4.\r\n\r\nWe next find a notice of the change of dynasty (Line 5) . . year\r\n7: the _Gods Phre and “Horus” and Phthah? gave the victory to_\r\nAUTOCRATOR CAESARIS _the Munificent_. The number 7 is indistinct;\r\nif correct it must belong to the later of the double dates of\r\nCleopatra’s reign, which terminated the 22nd or 7th, the year of\r\nthe Battle of Actium, in which the _victory_ was obtained by the\r\n_Emperor_ Augustus _Caesar_. Then follows a date of the _year_ 6,\r\nprobably of Caesar: and the seven stars of the wings may possibly\r\nrelate to the erection of the tablet in the subsequent year. We have\r\nalso a donation of _gold and silver gems_.\r\n\r\nThe second tablet (H 72, 73, 74 B) has first the date of the _year\r\n19 of King Ptolemy_ [Auletes] the _Defender of the sacred rites_ (L.\r\n3) . . _The year 4 of Cleopatra ‘Neotera?_ (4) . . _many years_ . .\r\n(5) The year 7? _the gods ‘Phre and Horus and Phthah? gave the\r\nvictory to the Emperor Caesar_, ‘and Phthah and Horus who loved him\r\ngave the dominion all men to? _Caesar_. (6) . . _gold and gems and\r\nsilver in abundance, gave them to the sanctuary of the great god in\r\nthe temple of Memphis_ . . The year 7 of Caesar: ‘Mechir 18? gave\r\nto the sanctuary of the great god in . . (8) . . _gold and gems and\r\nsilver_ . . (9) _Memphis_.\r\n\r\nWe have here no subsequent year 19 to which the stars of the margin\r\ncan refer: and it seems therefore most natural to [p315] suppose\r\nthat they belong to the earliest date, with which the tablet\r\ncommences: and perhaps the seven stars of the former may have been\r\nmarked by mistake for six. The interpretation of the marginal stars\r\nwill be easily brought to the test of future observations.\r\n\r\nPlates 75 and 76 contain portions of a large tablet from Sacchara,\r\nvery fairly written on chalk, of which the upper part is broken off,\r\nleaving only a few traces of a hieroglyphic inscription, which seems\r\nto have contained a date at the end, perhaps the 12th of Mechir.\r\n\r\n(1) [In the . . year of Queen Cleopatra] and _Ptolemy surnamed\r\nCaesaris_; the divine king . . living for ever. (7) . . _The year_ 9,\r\nAthyr or Mechir 9, _of the great King Ptolemy_ the god ‘Brother of\r\nApis? DIONYSUS ‘the awful? living for ever . .

(28) . .\r\n‘Written and engraved by? . . .\r\n\r\nIn the 79th plate there are four enchorial lines very distinctly\r\nwritten, and beginning with a date, which must be either 24 or 28,\r\nand most probably the latter, as there are 28 stars in the margin:\r\nperhaps the 11th of the month, in the reign of _Ptolemy the son of\r\nPtolemy, may he live for ever_. The rest is not intelligible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this manner, my dear Sir, I have been creeping, while others have\r\nbeen flying, though perhaps a little too near the sun. Possibly my\r\nfriend Champollion, and _your friend_ Seyffarth, would be able to\r\ndecipher much more of these inscriptions; and it is probable that\r\ntheir versions might differ in almost every particular. In this\r\ncase it is unnecessary for me to say which of the two explanations\r\nI should be inclined to prefer: for it is impossible to deny to\r\nChampollion the merit of great industry, and deep, as well as\r\nextensive research. I object only to his precipitation, and his\r\nlove of system, which, I think, cause him to be led away by his own\r\ningenuity, through a series of conclusions unsupported by sufficient\r\nevidence. [p316]\r\n\r\nAs an instance of a hasty and undemonstrated assertion, I shall\r\nmention his explanation of the group of characters which he considers\r\n(Système, p. 82) as “forming the third person plural of the future\r\nin all the verbs of the last nine lines of the hieroglyphical text\r\nof Rosetta, expressing the different dispositions of the decree, and\r\nanswering to Greek verbs, which are always in the infinitive,” and\r\nwhich he naturally enough reads SNE.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing absolutely incorrect in this statement, but the\r\nreader naturally infers from it that the group in question occurs\r\neither exclusively or principally in these nine lines. The fact is,\r\nhowever, that in the first five lines, or rather half lines, the\r\ngroup is found ten times, and in the remaining nine, only eighteen,\r\nthat is, about half as frequently, in proportion to the actual length\r\nof the lines: nor can I find any where a context that favours Mr.\r\nChampollion’s interpretation; though I have lately observed that an\r\nEnchorial group, resembling ´O, is found almost uniformly to answer\r\nto the Greek infinitive: being read perhaps MNR or MARE: but I\r\ncannot make these characters agree either with the hieroglyphics in\r\nquestion, or with the sounds SNE, which Mr. Champollion attributes to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo little is Mr. Champollion in the habit of distinguishing _proofs_\r\nfrom _assertions_ in his own case, that it is the less surprising\r\nthat he should sometimes confound them with respect to others.\r\nHe says, for example, with respect to the nature of the Hieratic\r\ncharacters, which he explained to the Academy of Belles Lettres\r\nin 1821, “_je me suis convaincu depuis que M. le Dr. Young avait\r\npublié avant moi ce même résultat, et de plus, que nous avions été_\r\nPREVENUS _de quelques années, l’un et l’autre, quant au_ principe de\r\ncette découverte et sa définition, par M. Tychsen de Goettingue.”\r\n(p. 20.) Professor Tychsen had _asserted_ this agreement as a\r\nprobable opinion: it was amply _demonstrated_ in 1816; _five years_\r\nafterwards Mr. Champollion thinks he has a right to consider himself\r\nas a new inventor of the doctrine, because he chose to neglect what\r\nwas done in a neighbouring country, and to undervalue the actual\r\n_proof_, in which he had been anticipated, by classing it with a bare\r\n_assertion_ to be found in a German publication. [p317] Precisely\r\nin the same spirit he remarks, in the next page, that Barthélemy\r\nand Zoëga had _pointed_ out the rings as containing proper names:\r\nthey had, indeed, _said_ that they might be proper names, _or_ moral\r\nsentences, _or_ something else; but the only question was, if it\r\nwas worth questioning at all, to whom belonged the priority of the\r\n_demonstration_ that they actually were proper names: which, before\r\nthe publication of the Archaeologia for 1814, was no where to be\r\nfound. This publication was the first great step after the discovery\r\nof the pillar of Rosetta: the second was the identification of the\r\ndifferent kinds of characters, in 1816, by means of the Déscription\r\nde l’Egypte: the third, the application of that identification to the\r\nnames of Ptolemy and Berenice: the fourth, perhaps, was Mr. Bankes’s\r\ndiscovery in Egypt, of the name of Cleopatra, which he sent to Paris:\r\nand on these grounds is certainly _founded_ ALL that is at present\r\nknown of Egyptian literature, for a very considerable proportion of\r\nwhich we are unquestionably indebted to Mr. Champollion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe French translator of Mr. Browne’s ingenious articles which\r\nappeared in the Edinburgh Review, has certainly gone a good deal out\r\nof his way to find matter of accusation against Mr. Champollion.\r\nHe quotes the text of a memoir published in 1821, and afterwards\r\n_suppressed_, in order to show that Mr. Champollion then continued\r\nto believe that the hieroglyphics were signs of things and not of\r\nsounds; and that he disagreed with those learned persons who had\r\nconsidered the hieratic writing as alphabetical. The date of this\r\nsuppressed paper is indeed of some consequence, as determining the\r\nperiod at which Mr. Champollion made his rediscovery of what Dr.\r\nYoung had published in 1816; that is, the fact of the essential\r\nidentity of the two systems of writing. But the translator might\r\nhave found in the beginning of the letter to Mr. Dacier, dated in\r\n1822, the same opinion respecting these systems of writing; that is,\r\nthe _hieratic_ and _demotic_, which, he says, are not alphabetic,\r\nbut “_ideographic_, like the hieroglyphics themselves,” expressing\r\nideas and not sounds: and he adds, that _he_ (!) has deduced from the\r\ndemotic inscription of Rosetta a series of characters which have a\r\n“_syllabico-alphabetic_ [p318] value,” by which foreign proper names\r\nwere expressed. (p. 2.)\r\n\r\nNothing can possibly agree better than this with the opinions which\r\nDr. Young had long before published; and which he has since confirmed\r\nin his octavo volume; and if Mr. Champollion’s ideas upon this\r\nsubject have sometimes appeared to fluctuate, it has probably been\r\nmore from a love of system, and a wish to establish originality, than\r\nfrom any new discoveries that he can have made respecting these two\r\nmodes of writing in particular.\r\n\r\nWhat precise forms of characters may be supposed to answer to the\r\nsense in which Mr. Champollion employs the word demotic, cannot\r\nvery easily be ascertained. It is remarkable that his “SNE” is a\r\ngroup very commonly found in the manuscripts of the Déscription de\r\nl’Egypte, which Mr. Champollion might possibly call demotic; while it\r\ncannot be identified in the Enchorial Inscription of Rosetta. This\r\nis an instance of the difficulty of finding appropriate terms where\r\nwe have not exact definitions. The difficulty is not avoided by the\r\nuse of the word Enchorial, except that it may with perfect safety be\r\napplied to such inscriptions as are capable of having any of their\r\nwords identified with the inscription so called on the pillar itself.\r\n\r\nThe verification of the chronology of Manetho must naturally be a\r\nwork of time, even after the complete identification of the names of\r\nthe kings, which cannot _yet_ be admitted to be satisfactory. There\r\nis one discordance that it may be right slightly to point out, as\r\nit is presented by Plate 43 of the Hieroglyphics: we there find the\r\n29th year of the Sesenchosis of Manetho; and Manetho allots but 21\r\nyears to this king, who was the first of his dynasty, and could not,\r\ntherefore, like Philadelphus, have continued any era from an earlier\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to observe, in comparing Mr. Cailliaud’s copy of the\r\nTablet of Abydus, as published by Mr. Champollion, with those of our\r\ncountrymen, Mr. Bankes and Mr. Wilkinson, contained in the 47th plate\r\nof the Hieroglyphics, or with the manuscript copy of Mr. Burton, how\r\nmuch more hastily the French traveller had executed his task than\r\n_any one_ of the three Englishmen. [p319]\r\n\r\nAnother of Mr. Wilkinson’s very valuable inscriptions, from a temple\r\nat Kous, must be allowed to give evidence much more favourable to Mr.\r\nChampollion, as far as it regards the signification of the _plough_,\r\nwhich seems to enter into the composition of _Philometor_, as applied\r\nto Cleopatra and “Ptolemy Alexander,” who are called Philometores\r\nSoteres, both here and in Anastasy’s Greek Manuscript. The name of\r\nAlexander had never occurred to the author of the article EGYPT, but\r\nhe had evidently a foresight in what way it would make its appearance\r\nwhen he observed, N. 55, “it will appear hereafter, that a knowledge\r\nof the enchorial forms may possibly contribute very materially, at\r\nsome future time, to assist us in determining it:” and he immediately\r\nproceeds to the subject of PHONETIC HIEROGLYPHICS.\r\n\r\nThe plough seems to be exchanged on the Minervean obelisk for the\r\ndentated quadrant and chain, which may hence have been synonymous\r\nwith the dentated parallelogram or comb: both perhaps having\r\nrepresented instruments which bore the same name, and served the same\r\npurposes, though of different forms: they may, for instance, have\r\nbeen rakes or harrows, and may hence have borne some analogy to the\r\nplough or hoe. Whether they had names beginning with M, may still be\r\nquestionable.\r\n\r\nMr. Champollion has endeavoured to explain the absence of the names\r\nof our queens from the tablet of Abydus, by saying that it must be\r\nconsidered as a tablet “purely _genealogical_.” First Letter to the\r\nD. de B. p. 89. A reader is naturally disposed to acquiesce in this\r\nexplanation, since Mr. Champollion, who has carefully examined it,\r\nasserts it on his own credit; especially as the assertion appears to\r\nbe supported by a long and minute discussion. Unhappily, however,\r\nit is only necessary to compare his brother’s chronology in P. 107,\r\nwith his own Plates II. and III. fig. 5, from which it appears\r\nthat Amenses, who _reigned_ more than 20 years, was the mother\r\nof Thuthmosis the second, whose name is in the tablet, while his\r\nmother’s is _omitted_. It is true that, with his usual ingenuity, Mr.\r\nChampollion seems afterwards to change his ground in the same page:\r\nfor he says, that one only of two brothers or sisters was inserted,\r\nin order to keep the number of the [p320] _generations_ unaltered:\r\nand he might have added that Amenses was the sister of Amenophis,\r\nwhom she succeeded. If he had stated this clearly, the reader might\r\nhave judged for himself, whether such a coincidence was or was not\r\nsufficient to support the chronology of Manetho; which was, however,\r\nby no means in want of _such_ support: in the article EGYPT, for\r\nexample, Manetho’s chronology of this dynasty is fully adopted: and\r\nthe same ‘cartouche’ is read _Thuthmosis_, which Mr. Champollion,\r\nafter all his parade, still admits to be Thuthmosis: nor is there\r\na difference of half a century in the dates assigned to his reign\r\nby various chronologists. It was established in the article Egypt,\r\nthat the name contained that of Thoth, the Egyptian Hermes, and for\r\nthis reason it was considered as better established than any other\r\nof the names of the Pharaohs. Mr. Champollion had never discovered\r\nthis for many years afterwards: and yet we have been told by an\r\nENGLISHMAN in the last Quarterly Journal, that to Mr. Champollion the\r\n_greater part_ of the _discoveries_ made by the interpretation of\r\nhieroglyphics are owing!\r\n\r\n Believe me, dear Sir, very sincerely, yours,\r\n                                      * * * *\r\n _London_, 24 _Nov._ 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _On the Naturalization of Fish. By_ J. Mac Culloch, M.D., F.R.S., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nAs I promised you that I would communicate to you, from time to\r\ntime, any new remarks or facts which might occur on the subject\r\nof naturalizing sea-fish in fresh water, I am pleased to have an\r\nopportunity of noticing a few circumstances which may serve to keep\r\nalive in the public mind a subject, from which I cannot yet help\r\nforeboding useful results, in spite of the neglect and opposition\r\nwhich it has experienced from every person, I believe I may safely\r\nsay, to whom it has been proposed, except Mr. Arnold. I am perfectly\r\nsafe in saying, that, with this sole exception, every individual to\r\nwhom the facts have been described, and the experiment proposed, have\r\nreplied by doubts, or cavils, or objections of some kind; many, by\r\n[p321] positive disbelief of the very facts; while the far greater\r\nnumber have been persons, whose entire ignorance of every requisite\r\npoint of physiology, natural history, and chemistry, must, of course,\r\nhave rendered their objections sufficiently unworthy of notice,\r\nthough not sufficient to restrain the confidence with which they\r\nhave been urged. The satirical writers of the day view this as the\r\ncharacter of the age: the more obvious aspect which this disposition\r\npresents, is the feeling, as if he who attempted, by suggesting an\r\nimprovement, to render a service, was meditating an injury, and was\r\nan enemy to be opposed at all hazards. I must permit you to settle\r\nmetaphysical and moral questions so profound as to exceed my own\r\ningenuity.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot avoid regretting that Mr. Arnold is not the rich\r\nand idle proprietor of some of the tens of thousands of acres\r\nof fresh water, whether Scotch or English, in which a ‘sea-fish\r\ncannot possibly live,’ or ‘would certainly not be eatable’: and,\r\nin addition, that, instead of a not very opulent and very busied\r\n‘notary public,’ he was not in possession of some five thousand of\r\nthese acres, with as much money, and as much leisure. And I feel\r\nbound to add to this apology for what he _has not_ yet done, that\r\nthe expense of such a course of experiments is considerable; at\r\nleast in this comparison. A superintendent would be necessary; and\r\nfor the purpose of taking and transporting the fish, still more of\r\ndrawing nets periodically and frequently, to ascertain the progress\r\nof the transplanted fish, there must be expensive assistance, for\r\nwhich, as yet, there can be no returns; while that, in addition\r\nto irregularities and rocks in the pond itself, impeding the\r\naccurate drawing and examination, must also be the apology for the\r\nimperfection of the present additional report as to the success for\r\ncertain fishes. It is plain that, though ten or a hundred turbots\r\nwere present in a pond of four or five acres, the fact is not one\r\nthat can easily be ascertained. Let those who have money, leisure,\r\nand water, and nothing else towards the investigation of this object,\r\nrestrain, at least, _their_ incredulity and opposition; as may also\r\nthey, very safely, who never saw a fish, except on the stall of a\r\nLondon fishmonger.\r\n\r\nWith respect now to some facts: it had been said that the water was\r\nsalt, because this pond was situated at a sea [p322] embankment.\r\nI stated before, that it admitted the sea, by leakage, in summer,\r\nwhen there was little comparative supply of fresh water, and was\r\ntherefore brackish, or saline. I have since ascertained the exact\r\nproportion of salt in the water, at those times when the fresh\r\nwater is least. In the driest and hottest part of one summer, the\r\nproportion of salt in it, as compared to the sea without, was as 40\r\nto 150. In another, peculiarly dry, 1827, it was one half; and the\r\nwater, having then been at the lowest, it cannot ever be computed to\r\nexceed this. Moreover, this period of saltness cannot easily, even\r\nin such a summer, occupy more than the months of June, July, August,\r\nand September; or, more strictly speaking, it is probable, scarcely\r\none half of that time in general, in so rainy a climate; a climate\r\nequalling Penzance in the quantity of rain.\r\n\r\nIn winter, that is, during five or six months, or less, if any\r\nobjector pleases, it is fresh. That cattle drink it freely, is not\r\nan exact chemical proof; but I must admit, that I have not analyzed\r\nthe water at that period, holding the objection in great contempt.\r\nIt may be sufficient to say, that it then occupies a space of about\r\nsixteen acres, or increases to this magnitude from four and a half\r\nacres; so that it cannot, at least, be very salt, while the fish, and\r\nthe mullet in particular, are found in the remotest ditches, among\r\nthe meadows. But, in defect of an analysis, which I have not had the\r\nmeans of making, there is a valid reason why the water should be\r\nfresh when the size of the pond is much extended. The presence of\r\nsea-water in it, is, in all cases, the consequence of a depression\r\nof the water within the sea-wall, which allows of leakage or\r\ninfiltration at the upper part, so as, in high tides, to equalize, as\r\nfar can be done in the short period of high water, the levels within\r\nand without. This, it is plain, must cease whenever the water within\r\nis higher than the sea without; and hence it is that there can be no\r\naccess for the salt water in the winter or rainy months.\r\n\r\nEnough of the mere fact: the objections derived from which ought\r\nnot to demand an answer among physiologists; while to those who\r\nargue physiological points in utter ignorance of all that belongs\r\nto physiology, it is probable that all answer is fruitless. It was\r\nstated before—the question is simply twofold; [p323] respiration\r\nand food. If fish can breathe indifferently salt water or fresh,\r\nfor one week or one month, and if, in their new element, translated\r\nfrom salt to fresh, they thrive or grow, fatten and breed, the trial\r\nof three weeks or three months is a sufficient proof that they will\r\nneither sicken nor die of fresh water. If they can find food, it is\r\nindifferent whether the medium is fresh or salt. It is the misfortune\r\nof the age to understand every thing without knowing its principles;\r\njust as every man is now a physician. A few, more profound, who\r\nchance to know that salmon divide their time between fresh and salt\r\nwater, possess other reasons, and find other objections; which they\r\nmust be permitted to explain for themselves. I ought not, while on\r\nthis particular subject, to omit one fact, which has come to my\r\nknowledge since the former papers were written, on the voluntary\r\nemigration of a fish, supposed to be peculiarly delicate and\r\npeculiarly attached to the sea, into fresh water. This is, that,\r\nin Virginia, the herring ascends the rivers, even up into the most\r\nminute communicating branches, and as far as it can reach; while a\r\nsomewhat recent traveller describes them as being so abundant, that\r\nit is impossible to cross the fords on horseback during the season\r\nof their migration, without destroying them by the horse’s feet. To\r\nproceed to the _historical_ condition of this pond.\r\n\r\nI have already stated the difficulties arising from want of leisure\r\nand wealth in the proprietor, added to non-residence I should say,\r\nwhence chiefly has arisen the difficulty of tracing the results. Let\r\nthose try for themselves, who consider that all this might have been\r\nascertained in a twelvemonth, and with the same means. Since the\r\ncommunications I formerly made, the Pilchard has been introduced. It\r\nswam away briskly, therefore it would not die of the fresh water;\r\nbut it has not been retaken. The retaking of individual fish, to\r\nascertain their presence, is a fundamental difficulty, as I before\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nThe Brill has also been introduced since my former list. It has been\r\nretaken; and, within one year, had grown to double the original size.\r\n\r\nThe Turbot. Fifty or sixty were introduced, averaging about eight\r\ninches in length. Some were retaken in a year, for the purpose of\r\nexamination merely, like the former and most others; [p324] they\r\nalso had grown to double the size. There is no prospect of dying\r\nin these cases, it is abundantly plain; that they will breed is\r\nprobable, but there has been no time, nor would the young have been\r\ntaken. What is to prevent healthy fishes from breeding? The young,\r\nindeed, may be eaten; if so, it is for want of room, or want of a\r\nproper balance in this mixed population. No one knows any thing,\r\neither of the ordinary growth, propagation, or destruction of fishes;\r\nand how then can any one decide on what is regular or extraordinary?\r\n\r\nThe Wrasse has been retaken after a considerable period; therefore it\r\nis not dead.\r\n\r\nThe Basse has propagated; and so has the Brill.\r\n\r\nThe Red Mullet has been introduced, and is living.\r\n\r\nThe Whiting was introduced, and taken in good health many weeks\r\nafter, but not since.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Loach is thought to have bred considerably.\r\n\r\nThe Atherine continues to breed.\r\n\r\nI formerly mentioned that the flavour of the several fishes was\r\nimproved: this is now more positively asserted, in addition, of the\r\nBasse, the Plaice, and the Red Loach. Others were mentioned in former\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nLoss of property, or flavour, has been made a speculative objection\r\nby the unvarying objectors. General experience has shown, that in all\r\nfishes, as far as known, the access to fresh water, or fresh water\r\nfood, improved the flavour; in many, in oysters, muscles, cockles,\r\nshrimps, it is vulgarly notorious; as in mere sea water they are\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\nThere is a popular objection, on this head, made by the country\r\ngentlemen, which I must answer; to those who _think_ about what they\r\nknow, it would have been superfluous. The salmon is good when it\r\ncomes from the sea, and bad when it is returning. Doubtless, it is;\r\nwhile the reason ought to be plain, even to an angler. It is in full\r\nhealth in the first case: in the latter, it has spawned; and, at that\r\nperiod, every fish is proportionally as bad as the salmon; many are a\r\ngreat deal worse. The fault is not in the water, nor probably in the\r\nfood; it is in the spawning, and with any food the same effect takes\r\nplace, in all fishes, everywhere.\r\n\r\nI suggested in former communications, that an essential point [p325]\r\nto ascertain, in any view of economy, or management, would be the\r\nproper balance of species; to discover what kinds would so live\r\ntogether that all the species might find food; might breed, each to\r\nits useful limits, so as to be serviceable to ourselves, the keepers\r\nor the flocks, and without hazard of the extermination of any kind. I\r\nmay illustrate what is here meant, by a simple fact, in the ordinary\r\neconomy of fresh water fishes in confinement. Pike and perch can live\r\ntogether, because the natural defences of the perch prevent the pike\r\nfrom exterminating the race, voracious as the enemy is. If trout and\r\npike were confined in a narrow water, the trout would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nOr otherwise, it must be our object to ascertain, in an economical\r\nview, how to feed, by means of species that we do not desire to eat,\r\nthose which we do cultivate for our own uses. This is a difficult\r\nquestion, which can only be overcome by time and experience; by\r\nknowledge; by knowledge, when we are in a state of entire ignorance;\r\nignorance of every thing that relates to fishes, as great as if they\r\nwere the inhabitants of another planet. This was one great source of\r\ndifficulties with us in this case; and I, myself, must plead guilty,\r\nI fear, to a general recommendation of introducing every fish as a\r\nmere matter of trial; the result of which has been mischievous. The\r\nbasse appears to have been the great enemy; to have eaten up the\r\ngreater number of many species, and given no return. It has proved\r\nthe pike of this pond. This could not have been foreseen; it is a\r\ncaution for future speculators. Others will be discovered in the\r\ncourse of trial. It appears also that the common crab has proved\r\ndestructive, probably by eating the spawn of larger fishes. From some\r\nenemy or other, the eels, which at first abounded to an incredible\r\ndegree, have most materially diminished, and so have the shrimps.\r\nThe latter, at least, appear to have been destroyed by the basse.\r\nTime and trial will teach us what to do in this case; in the infancy\r\nof ignorance, man might have supposed that he could keep wolves and\r\nsheep in one field, and have constructed a pen for foxes and fowls,\r\nrabbits and weasels. We must not accuse nature of our own ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe question is here a difficult one; but a little more study [p326]\r\nof the general habits of fishes, merely as we know them already,\r\nand even of their anatomy, will go far to lay the foundation of\r\nuseful rules on this head, even without a hazardous trial, which may\r\nultimately not become in our power to remedy, as I much fear may\r\nprove the case with respect to these unlucky basse. Not to enter on\r\nthis further than as it may serve for a general illustration of what\r\nis here meant, the anatomy of the mullet proves that it lives on\r\nworms; on the lumbricus marinus, and others; and so do its habits.\r\nSo also may the very food of others, as found in the stomach, serve\r\nto indicate their natural or ordinary food. Reversely, the anatomy\r\nof a cod’s jaws, and its stomach also, prove it to be omnivorous,\r\nomnivoracious. Or, further, the anatomical character of the diodon\r\nproves that it eats shell-fish; as we are equally able to limit the\r\nrange of food in the flat-fish which have no air-bladders, and cannot\r\nquit the ground.\r\n\r\nBut in this brief communication, I must not enter further into this\r\nsubject than is necessary for mere illustration. I may take some\r\nfurther opportunity to point out the probabilities, as to mutual food\r\nand protection, in any artificial cultivation of this nature, as they\r\nmight be derived from studying the little that we do know about the\r\nstructure and habits of fishes. All that I need add here, is, that I\r\nhave suggested the introduction of limpets, periwinkles, and cockles;\r\nas affording food without furnishing enemies: a matter which had\r\nbeen overlooked. To exterminate the enemies which have been unwarily\r\nintroduced, will not prove so easy a task; unless, at least, we could\r\nfind their natural enemies; find the great secret by which alone, in\r\nall cases, man can make war on those whom neither his artillery, his\r\nphysic, nor his politics can reach.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of fishes has been objected to as difficult.\r\nI had occasion to make some remarks on this formerly, and on the\r\nvitality of some kinds. The difficulty is not so great as has been\r\nimagined. The fact generally is, that fishermen, even down to the\r\nvery sentimentalists who worship the gentle Izaak, and who are\r\nsometimes scarcely possessed of the wit of a fish, treat them as they\r\nwould a stone; as if they had not lives, and wills, and opinions,\r\nand were not part of the same [p327] creation as ourselves; as if\r\nthat creation, which outnumbers ourselves by millions of millions\r\nalmost beyond algebra to express, was not, like ourselves, under His\r\ncare. They are easily killed by violence; they kill themselves by\r\nover-exertion, from anatomical peculiarities; as every trout-fisher\r\nknows; that is to say, the fact, not the cause. Let them be treated\r\nwith gentleness when taken, as if they could feel; and they will\r\nnot die in being removed into a cask of water. The flat fish are\r\nall peculiarly tenacious of life, so are all those of firm muscles\r\ngenerally: the vitality of the carp and of the minnow also is\r\nnotorious; and so it is as to many other kinds. All these can be\r\nremoved, and carried far, even in straw; but in truth, he who chooses\r\nto make his experiments like a philosopher, and who desires to\r\nsucceed, will not fail.\r\n\r\nYet let me point out what I have suggested to Mr. Arnold, among\r\nother things: to him, whose merit as an ardent experimenter, always\r\nready to adopt a reasonable suggestion, and never seeking for an\r\nobjection, ought to stamp his character as a genuine follower of the\r\ntrue philosophy; the exception, in this particular case, to every one\r\nelse. This is, to adopt the Chinese method of transporting the spawn\r\nof fishes; as affording a far greater facility to the introduction\r\nof species. I presume that the general fact must be known to your\r\nreaders; though I believe that I ought to doubt: because I quoted\r\nthe same practice from Columella formerly, as in use among the most\r\nancient Romans, among the common farmers.\r\n\r\nThis substance is perpetually brought up by the trawl net, very\r\ninjuriously, as it relates to fisheries; and in many cases, the\r\nfishermen contrive to guess tolerably well to what fish it belongs.\r\nThat it may be transported to any distance, the familiar practice\r\nof China proves: since it is there a common article of sale in\r\nthe markets; while there also, I may incidentally remark, the\r\ncultivation of fish for sale, their transportation to market, and\r\ntheir replacement in the ponds, if unsold, is as much matter of\r\nordinary farming as the management of a poultry-yard; while the\r\npond is often the most profitable part of the farm. They also,\r\nwho do not already chance to know it, may be informed, that this\r\nspecies of poultry-yard, or fish-pond, is as easily and regularly\r\n[p328] stocked in this manner, and managed, as any other portion\r\nof the farm: since it is even destroyed, or suffered to become dry\r\noccasionally, and again renewed in the wet season, by the means of\r\npurchased spawn, or stock; just as a sheep farmer buys lambs to stock\r\nhis mountains. If England is too wise to learn of Rome or China, or\r\nof France and Germany, or even of the experiments on which I have\r\ndwelt so much and so often, it must be a pleasing reflection that\r\nit is already so amply informed as to have passed the bounds of\r\nall possible improvement and all possible wishes. But that I may\r\nterminate this particular suggestion, I will only further point out,\r\nthat lobsters, and the crab tribe generally, might very easily be\r\ntransported in this manner, and that, in them, it is easily known\r\nwhen the _ovum_ has been impregnated, by means of a black spot with\r\nwhich it is then marked.\r\n\r\nIf I ought to apologize already for the length of this communication,\r\nI shall conclude it by saying, that whatever may be judged of the\r\ngeneral philosophy of this subject, there is not and never has been\r\nany thing to prevent the cultivation of fish, in ponds of salt-water\r\nat least, or the preservation of them in any water in which they will\r\nlive for a sufficient length of time, so as to render that a depôt\r\nfor the purposes of a fish store, calculated for the steady supply\r\nof a market, in the manner which I formerly described and proposed.\r\nIf, after so many years as this proposal has been made, London has\r\nnot seen either the facility, or the utility, it will discover them\r\nat some future day; just as it discovered, ten years after there had\r\nbeen twenty-six steam-boats on the Clyde, that a steam-boat might\r\npossibly be of use on the Thames; just as it opposed gas-lights, and\r\njust as it has adopted gas-lights.

As he entered the\r\n chamber on a certain occasion, he was thus addressed by his patient:\r\n ‘Good day to you, Mr. Bouvart; I feel quite in spirits, and think\r\n my fever has left me.’ ‘I am sure of it,’ replied the doctor; ‘the\r\n very first expression you used convinces me of it.’ ‘Pray explain\r\n yourself.’ ‘Nothing more easy: in the first days of your illness,\r\n when your life was in danger, I was your _dearest friend_; as\r\n you began to get better, I was your _good Bouvart_; and now I am\r\n Mr. Bouvart: depend upon it you are quite recovered.’ Bouvart’s\r\n observation was grounded on a knowledge of human nature: every day’s\r\n experience shows, that ‘_accipe dum dolet_’ should be the medical\r\n man’s motto.\r\n\r\n JOHN CASE.\r\n\r\n “In one of the profound pieces of astrological bombast written\r\n by this singular genius, he gives an account of the creation of\r\n Adam: ‘_Thus_ Adam was created in that pleasant place _Paradise_,\r\n about the year before Christ 4002, viz. on April 24, at twelve\r\n o’clock, or midnight.’ His name was latinized to _Caseus_, which was\r\n occasionally interpreted Dr. _Cheese_. Granger says the following\r\n anecdote of Case was communicated to him by the Rev. Mr. Gosling,\r\n in these terms: ‘Dr. Maundy, formerly of Canterbury, told me, that\r\n in his travels abroad, some eminent physician, who had been in\r\n England, gave him a token to spend at his return with Dr. Radcliffe\r\n and Dr. Case. They fixed on an evening, and were very merry, when\r\n Radcliffe thus began a health: ‘Here, brother Case, to all the fools\r\n your patients.’ ‘I thank you, good brother,’ replied Case; ‘let me\r\n have all the fools, and you are heartily welcome to the rest of the\r\n practice.’’\r\n\r\n THOMAS DAWSON.\r\n\r\n “The following anecdote is related of him: After he became M.D. he\r\n attended his neighbour Miss Corbett, of Hackney, who [p331] was\r\n indisposed; and found her one day sitting solitary, piously and\r\n pensively musing upon the Bible, when, _by some strange accident_,\r\n his eyes were directed to the passage where Nathan says to David,\r\n ‘Thou art the Man.’ The doctor profited by the kind hint; and, after\r\n a proper time allowed for drawing up articles of capitulation,\r\n the lady, on 29th May, 1758, surrendered herself up to all his\r\n prescriptions, and the doctor very speedily performed a perfect cure.\r\n\r\n PHILIP HECQUET.\r\n\r\n “‘C’est une erreur de penser que le sang soit nécessaire à la\r\n conservation de la vie; on ne peut trop saigner un malade;’ are the\r\n words put into the mouth of our doctor, in the character of Sangrado\r\n by the facetious Le Sage. Hecquet, both in theory and practice,\r\n carried the _anti-phlogistic_ system to a greater extent than any\r\n other man, and defended the ‘_boisson_’ and the _bleeding_, saying,\r\n ‘J’ai pour garants de mon sentiment, sur le _Régime maigre_, les\r\n médecins les plus fameux, tant anciens que modernes.’ He was a\r\n conscientious practitioner of his own eccentric doctrines, and it\r\n was perfectly consistent with his character, that ‘loin d’imputer la\r\n mort du chanoine à la boisson et aux saignées, il sortit en disant,\r\n d’un air froid, qu’on ne lui avait pas tiré _assez de sang_, ni fait\r\n boire _assez d’eau chaude_.’\r\n\r\n “The practice of _bleeding_ was carried to a singular extent in\r\n France, and it was the fashion, at one time, to bleed on the\r\n opposite side to the part affected; if the pain was on the right\r\n side, they bled in the left arm, and _vice versâ_. Pierre Brissot\r\n produced a civil war in the medical world by writing against the\r\n custom, and, in the year 1600, was driven into exile, by edict of\r\n the University of Paris, for thus opposing the established practice.\r\n\r\n SIR CHARLES SCARBOROUGH\r\n\r\n “Was a man of great versatility of talents; he wrote a ‘Treatise on\r\n Trigonometry,’ and a ‘Compendium of Lilly’s Grammar;’ gave lectures\r\n on mathematics at Cambridge, and on anatomy in London. His epitaph\r\n records that he was\r\n\r\n Inter Medicos Hippocrates, Inter Mathematicos Euclides.\r\n\r\n He read the lecture founded by Dr. Caldwell, at Barber-surgeons’\r\n Hall, for many years; where he was the first who attempted to\r\n account for muscular strength and motion on geometrical principles.\r\n He was a man of amiable manners and great vivacity of conversation.\r\n Seeing the Duchess of Portsmouth eat to excess, he said to her, with\r\n his usual frankness, ‘Madam, I will deal with you as a physician\r\n should do; _you must eat less, use more exercise, take physic, or be\r\n sick_.’\r\n\r\n DR. PITCAIRN\r\n\r\n “Was a great enemy to quackery and quacks, of whom he used [p332]\r\n to say that there were not such liars in the world, except their\r\n patients. A relation of his, one day, asking his opinion of a\r\n certain work on fevers, he observed, ‘I do not like fever curers;\r\n we _may guide_ a fever—we cannot _cure_ it. What would you think of\r\n a pilot who attempted to quell a storm? Either position is equally\r\n absurd. We must steer the ship as well as we can in a storm; and in\r\n a fever we can only employ patience and judicious measures, to meet\r\n the difficulties of the case.’”\r\n\r\nTurn we now to the second article in our list,—_Nugæ Canoræ_; and we\r\nare satisfied that our readers will agree with us in the correctness\r\nof our _guess_. It is the production, at any rate, of one who has\r\nlived much in the medical world, and no unobservant spectator of\r\nthe vices and virtues, the feelings and failings of contemporary\r\npractitioners, possessing tact to “catch the manners living as they\r\nrise.” In short, it is a pleasant _jeu d’esprit_; and we hail it as\r\nan omen, that in these “piping times of peace,” the days of Garth,\r\nGoldsmith, and Darwin may be revived, and that the medical fraternity\r\nmay again employ their _leisure_ hours in amusements for which their\r\neducation and intercourse with society so well qualify them.\r\n\r\nAfter a humorous preface, in which the removal of the College\r\nof Physicians to Pall-mall East is lamented, the work, for very\r\nsatisfactory reasons, is dedicated to the Presidents of the two\r\nColleges and to the Master of the Company of Apothecaries, for the\r\nyear 1927—and as a character in one of Foote’s farces wishes he were\r\nto be born “fifty years hence,” so should we like to have a peep at\r\nthe “Clines and Coopers,” the “Halfords and Warrens,” of that day. We\r\nwish, with the author, that they may be as distinguished ornaments of\r\ntheir profession as those of our own.\r\n\r\nThat the old college should still be preserved for medical purposes,\r\nit is proposed to turn it into a “Medical Mausoleum,” where the\r\n“Medical Fraternity” are to be buried on the same terms as the\r\nParisians are at Père la Chaise—and then follow the supposed Epitaphs\r\nof the present race of the “Medici.” Due honour is done to learning\r\nand talents; while quackery, in all its ramifications, meets with\r\njust castigation. The names of Heberden, Turton, and Baker are\r\nnoticed with the respect to which their virtues and acquirements\r\nentitle them.\r\n\r\nPassing from these, we are introduced to an eccentric of the old\r\nschool. [p333]\r\n\r\n “SIR RICHARD JEBB, BART. M.D.\r\n\r\n    “Here, caught in Death’s web,\r\n     Lies the great Doctor JEBB,\r\n Who got gold-dust just like Astley Cooper;\r\n     Did you speak about diet,\r\n     He would kick up a riot,\r\n And swear like a madman or trooper.\r\n\r\n    “When he wanted your money,\r\n     Like sugar or honey,\r\n Sir Richard looked happy and placid;\r\n     Having once touched the cash,\r\n     He was testy and rash,\r\n And his honey was turned to an acid.\r\n\r\n “Sir Richard was very rough and harsh in manner. He said to a\r\n patient, to whom he had been very rude, ‘_Sir, it is my way_.’\r\n ‘Then,’ replied the patient, pointing to the door, ‘I beg you will\r\n make _that your way_.’ Sir Richard was not very nice in his mode of\r\n expression, and would frequently astonish a patient with a volley\r\n of oaths. Nothing used to make him swear more than the eternal\r\n question, ‘What may I eat?—Pray, Sir Richard, may I eat a muffin?’\r\n ‘Yes, Madam, the _best thing_ you can take.’ ‘O dear! I am glad of\r\n that. But, Sir Richard, you told me the other day, that it was the\r\n _worst_ thing I could eat!’ ‘What would be proper for me to eat\r\n to-day?’ says another lady. ‘Boiled turnips.’ ‘Boiled turnips! you\r\n forget, Sir Richard, I told you I could not bear boiled turnips.’\r\n ‘Then, Madam, you must have a d—— d vitiated appetite.’”\r\n\r\nWe cannot help bringing before our readers the following well-known\r\n“characters” of their day, and should have indulged in more ample\r\nquotations from these amusing “Epitaphs,” were we not afraid of the\r\nimputation of “inappropriateness.”\r\n\r\n “_On a most venerable and highly venerated Surgeon, lately deceased_.\r\n\r\n ‘Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit,\r\n  Nulli flebilior quam mihi.’—HOR.\r\n\r\n “Of manners gentle, and in soul sincere,\r\n  Removed beyond this sublunary sphere,\r\n      Here lies an honest man!\r\n  Endued with caution, yet devoid of fear,\r\n  In practice dexterous, in judgment clear—\r\n      Excel him if you can!”\r\n\r\nTo this, we think, may be affixed the name of Henry Cline! [p334]\r\n\r\n “CHARLES GOWER, M.D.\r\n\r\n ‘Discours de bons mots!’\r\n\r\n “Ye sons of humour, of frolic, and fun,\r\n  This stone will inform you that Gower is gone.\r\n  Poor Gower! eccentric, facetious, and funny,\r\n  Lik’d nothing so well as other men’s money.\r\n  Alas! he is gone—’tis hard to say where,\r\n  The victim of mirth, imprudence, and care.\r\n  Where’er he is gone, his companions he’ll smoke,\r\n  For, cost what it will—he will have his joke.\r\n\r\n “‘I knew him well, Horatio!’” exclaims our Author—“‘a fellow of\r\n infinite jest!’—Chairman of the St. Alban’s Club, where oft ‘he\r\n set the table on a roar.’—And who did not know this eccentric\r\n oddity? Gower had considerable talents, but they were directed\r\n every way but the right. He made medicine a plaything, never being\r\n steady in professional pursuits. He wrote several singular books:\r\n one he entitled ‘Auxiliaries to Medicine;’ another, ‘The Art of\r\n Painting;’ both of which pourtray the character of their author. His\r\n unsteadiness led him into difficulties, and he died in obscurity.”\r\n\r\n “DALMAHOY.\r\n\r\n ‘Thrice happy were those golden days of old,\r\n  When dear as burgundy p’tisans were sold.’\r\n\r\n\r\n “Dalmahoy sold infusions and lotions,\r\n    Decoctions, and gargles, and pills;\r\n  Electuaries, powders, and potions,\r\n    Spermaceti, salts, scammony, squills.\r\n\r\n  Horse-aloes, burnt alum, agaric,\r\n    Balm, benzoine, blood-stone, and dill;\r\n  Castor, camphor, and acid tartaric,\r\n    With _specifics_ for every ill.\r\n\r\n  But with all his specifics in store\r\n    Death on Dalmahoy one day did pop;\r\n  And although he had doctors a score,\r\n    Made poor Dalmahoy shut up his shop.”\r\n\r\n\r\n “HENRY REVELL REYNOLDS, M.D.,\r\n\r\n ‘Os placidum moresque benigni.’\r\n\r\n\r\n “Here well-dressed Revell Reynolds lies,\r\n    As great a beau as ever!\r\n  We may perhaps see one as wise,\r\n    But sure a smarter never.\r\n\r\n “Dr. Reynolds may be considered as the link between the ancient and\r\n modern costume of the Faculty: to the last, he wore a well-powdered\r\n wig and a silk coat. He was an excellent [p335] specimen of a\r\n well-dressed and well-bred gentleman. As a practitioner he ranked in\r\n the first class, and he was one of the physicians who attended King\r\n George the Third during his afflicting and protracted malady.”\r\n\r\n\r\n “RICHARD GRINDALL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n ‘Eamus quo ducet gula.’\r\n\r\n\r\n “Within this place Dick Grindall lies,\r\n    Who was a rare game chicken.\r\n  So, so, friend Dick, an old chum cries,\r\n    The worms have pretty picking!\r\n\r\n  No Surgeon better lov’d himself;\r\n    He lov’d old rum and brandy\r\n  As much as misers do their pelf,\r\n    Or children sugar-candy.\r\n\r\n  And as for eatables—in short,\r\n    He lov’d both roast and boil’d;\r\n  Fish, flesh, or fowl, of any sort,\r\n    If not by cooking spoil’d.\r\n\r\n  But though full well he lov’d good cheer,\r\n    It was a venial fault;\r\n  Since Reason’s feast to him was dear,\r\n    Season’d with _Attic Salt_.\r\n\r\n “He was an excellent surgeon of his day; that is, fifty years before\r\n Abernethy or Cooper was dreamt of. He was also a great oddity,\r\n but a perfect gentleman in his appearance and manner; never seen,\r\n by any accident, but in a well-powdered wig, silk stockings, and\r\n shoe-buckles. He practised in the City, when the city aristocracy\r\n resided within its walls, and Haberdashers’ “Hall, in the season,\r\n assembled all the wit, wisdom, and wealth of London merchants, in a\r\n sort of conclave of saltatory civic magnificos.”\r\n\r\nWe just remember him, and that, after a long illness, he went round\r\nin his carriage to return thanks for “obliging inquiries,” leaving\r\nhis card, on which was written, “the remains of Dick Grindall.”\r\n\r\nThe third and last work we have to notice, comes more legitimately\r\nbefore us, and is a novelty in medical literature—a sort of _Sketch\r\nBook_, containing much entertaining anecdote, that makes the\r\ninformation it contains extremely amusing.\r\n\r\nThe work is divided into three parts, as the alliterated title\r\nquaintly informs us—Mems., Maxims, and Memoirs. The first is a\r\nchronological record, giving, as it were, a “bird’s eye view” of the\r\nmost interesting events in the history of medicine, from the time of\r\nthe conquest up to the [p336] present century. The second consists\r\nof comments, or short essays, illustrative of some of the most\r\nimportant facts; and the third of biographical anecdotes.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of “_Medical Books_,” we are presented with curious\r\nspecimens of our earliest writers, with comments; but let the author\r\nspeak for himself.\r\n\r\n “One of the first of our English writers, is John of Gaddesden,\r\n whose ‘Rosa Anglica,’ was greatly esteemed, and he is favourably\r\n mentioned by Chaucer. John was a man to whom nothing came amiss; he\r\n had an anodyne necklace for fits, and an infallible cataplasm for\r\n gout; he was a dexterous bone-setter, and a good dentist. He was\r\n very assiduous in inventing lotions for ladies’ complexions; and was\r\n complaisant enough to cut their corns; and as for those troublesome\r\n animalcules, which, in those days, used to infest _gentlemen’s_\r\n heads, he had a most effectual method of destroying them; and\r\n in his celebrated book, he favours us with a whimsical cure for\r\n small-pox.—‘Immediately after the eruption, cause the whole body of\r\n your patient to be wrapped in red scarlet cloth, or in any other red\r\n cloth, and command everything about the bed to be made red. This is\r\n an excellent cure. It was in this manner I treated the son of the\r\n noble King of England, when he had the small-pox; and I cured him,\r\n without leaving any marks.’\r\n\r\n “Such was our countryman, John of Gaddesden, who deserves notice,\r\n moreover, as being the first English surgeon employed at court; and\r\n that the King (Edward III.) wrote a letter to the Pope in favour of\r\n him.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ardern’s manuscripts, he observes—\r\n\r\n “These manuscripts, though they are more ludicrous than luminous,\r\n are extremely well worth the attention of the surgical antiquary,\r\n from the numerous illustrations they contain of the mode and manner\r\n in which Ardern performed his operations; which, considering that he\r\n was an _improver_ of surgery, gives us a glorious notion of what the\r\n art was previously to John’s refinements, or those of Roger Franks,\r\n whom he mentions with great praise.”\r\n\r\n “ANATOMICAL LECTURES.\r\n\r\n “When Dr. Hunter began his anatomical lectures, they were given\r\n in the evening—but as he lived at the period when Garrick was in\r\n his zenith, he soon discovered that he stood no chance with the\r\n actor, for whenever Garrick _lectured_, the _anatomical lectures_\r\n were neglected. In vain did the Doctor preach to the pupils on the\r\n immorality of attending theatres, and the impropriety of neglecting\r\n him; it was of no avail; Romeo’s apothecary and Dr. Last were the\r\n only medical characters to spend the evening with, and for the rest,\r\n they thought Macbeth sufficient authority, to ‘throw physic to the\r\n dogs.’ [p337]\r\n\r\n “For this reason, and for this reason alone, the anatomical lectures\r\n were afterwards given in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\n “Dr. Hunter may be considered as the father of the anatomical\r\n schools of London, and he bequeathed a fame and character to his\r\n class, which has been supported with undiminished lustre to the\r\n present day. Previously to his time, very little had been done;\r\n Cheselden had given a few lectures—so had André, and Nourse; and\r\n Dr. Frank Nicholls gave what he considered a systematic course, and\r\n published a Syllabus of thirty-nine lectures. Dr. Maclauren and\r\n Dr. Marshal were also anatomical teachers. To the late Mr. Cline,\r\n however, and to Mr. Abernethy, we are indebted for the anatomical\r\n schools at two of our largest hospitals.\r\n\r\n “Mr. Cline, it is true, found a place to lecture in, but it was his\r\n great talents and his high character, that brought it into notice,\r\n and subsequently, with Sir Astley Cooper, made it one of the first\r\n schools in Europe.\r\n\r\n “To Abernethy is due the sole honour of establishing the Anatomical\r\n School at St. Bartholomew’s, now second to none; and it is to the\r\n advantages arising from the hospital education of the metropolis,\r\n that London has become, within the last half century, the most\r\n distinguished seat of medical tuition in the world. Long may it\r\n flourish!\r\n\r\n ‘Quicquid est laudabile, idem est beatum et florens.’—_Cicero_.”\r\n\r\n “APOTHECARY.\r\n\r\n “Apothecary, in its derivative sense, does not seem to allude\r\n particularly to the sellers of medicines. Αποθηκη is of very\r\n indefinite signification, (_Horreum_,) a market, shop, or\r\n repository, which may be used or applied to any other business.\r\n Chaucer and Pegge make it _Poticarry_, while some have derived it\r\n from _A-pot-he-carries_, intimating, that they used to carry the\r\n medicines themselves, as well as see them administered. ‘Give me an\r\n ounce of civet, good apothecary,’ says Shakspeare.\r\n\r\n “The ancient apothecaries were called ΡΙΖΟΤΟΜΟΙ, root-cutters; and\r\n root-cutters they may still be considered; at any rate, no one\r\n will deny to honest, herborizing Tom Wheeler, the character of a\r\n primitive ΡΙΖΟΤΟΜΟΣ.\r\n\r\n “That they may still be characterised by this appellation, their\r\n ‘herborizing walks,’ and their botanic garden at Chelsea, afford\r\n very creditable proofs; nor is there any circumstance in the history\r\n of the present worshipful society, that reflects more honour on\r\n their zeal in promoting those branches of science, which appertain\r\n to their avocation, than the disinterestedness and liberality with\r\n which, during the last two centuries, they have maintained their\r\n establishment at Chelsea.\r\n\r\n “An active and intelligent member of their court has furnished them\r\n with a very interesting and ample memoir on the subject, [p338] by\r\n which it appears, that this expensive design was commenced at a time\r\n when the society was without any disposable funds, when their hall\r\n was burnt down in the memorable fire, and when they were obliged\r\n to draw upon their own private pecuniary resources, to enable them\r\n to enter on an undertaking, ‘whose principal design was honourable\r\n reputation, without any prospect of worldly advantage.’\r\n\r\n “Previously to the establishment of this garden, there had been\r\n nothing of the kind, with the exception of a few private gardens,\r\n the most conspicuous of which were those of the celebrated John\r\n Gerarde, and the elder Tradescant; the former of these not then\r\n being in existence, and the latter in a state of neglect and ruin;\r\n and the locality of their position is now only known from the\r\n records of the times.\r\n\r\n “There was, however, besides these, a small garden in Westminster,\r\n belonging to Mrs. Gape, the plants from which furnished the first\r\n specimens for the Chelsea Garden. It appears from Evelyn’s journal,\r\n that he paid old Mrs. Gape’s _medical garden_ a visit in June 1658;\r\n whether he begged, borrowed, or bought any plants, does not appear;\r\n that he had a very fine garden at Sayer’s Court, is well known;\r\n but that he lent it to that royal barbarian, Peter the Great, when\r\n he was studying ship-building at Deptford, is, perhaps, not so\r\n generally known, nor, moreover, the return this royal carpenter\r\n made to Evelyn’s politeness, or the manner in which he showed\r\n his horticultural taste, in being wheeled through his landlord’s\r\n ornamental hedges, and over his borders, in a wheel-barrow; a\r\n circumstance which is recorded in a letter to the then Secretary of\r\n the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n “In France, the apothecaries were incorporated so early as 1484;\r\n but it was not till the reign of King James the First, when the\r\n metropolis abounded in dangerous empirics, who made and compounded\r\n many ‘hurtful, false, and pernicious medicines,’ that the Worshipful\r\n Society of Apothecaries were incorporated in London. Notwithstanding\r\n a charter was given them to correct these abuses, it was found to be\r\n nugatory with respect to those who were not members of the society;\r\n and, although they made repeated applications to parliament, it\r\n is only within these very few years that their powers have been\r\n extended, and that they could legally enter the shop of any ‘person\r\n or persons using the art and mystery of an apothecary, in any part\r\n of England and Wales, for the purpose of searching, surveying, and\r\n proving whether the medicines, wares, drugs, or any thing or things\r\n whatsoever, in such shop or shops contained, and belonging to the\r\n art or mystery of an apothecary, be wholesome, meet, and fit for the\r\n cure, health, and ease of His Majesty’s subjects.’” [p339]\r\n\r\n “TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n    ‘Tobacco’s a physician,\r\n Good both for sound and sickly;\r\n    ’Tis a hot perfume,\r\n     That expels cold Rheume,\r\n And makes it flow down quickly.’\r\n\r\n “So says an old song, in an old play, and so said Dr. Ralph Thorius,\r\n and the learned Dr. Everard, who wrote a book, entitled ‘Panacea, or\r\n a Universal Medicine, being a Discovery of the wonderful Virtues of\r\n Tobacco’ (1659); and in the frontispiece of his book, the Doctor is\r\n represented with a pipe in his mouth. Dr. William Butler, styled,\r\n by Fuller, the Æsculapius of his age, was also a great admirer\r\n of tobacco, and that he might not smoke a dry pipe, he invented\r\n a medical drink, called ‘Butler’s Ale;’ afterwards sold at the\r\n Butler’s Head, in Mason’s-alley, Basinghall-street.\r\n\r\n “Sir Theodore Mayerne gives a curious specimen of his tobacco\r\n practice: ‘A person applying to him with a violent defluxion on his\r\n teeth, Butler told him, that ‘a hard knot must be split with a hard\r\n wedge,’ and directed him to smoke tobacco without intermission,\r\n till he had consumed an ounce of the herb. The man was accustomed\r\n to smoke; he therefore took twenty-five pipes at a sitting. This\r\n first occasioned extreme sickness, and then a flux of saliva, which,\r\n with gradual abatement of the pain, ran off to the quantity of two\r\n quarts. The disorder was entirely cured, and did not return for\r\n seventeen years.’\r\n\r\n “Ant. Wood says, that he was much resorted to, ‘and had been more,\r\n did he not delight to please himself with fantastical humours.’\r\n\r\n “Many singular stories are related of him, perhaps they are\r\n travelling stories, as may be conjectured, from the nature of the\r\n prescription, when he ordered a lethargic parson to be put into the\r\n warm carcase of a newly-killed cow!\r\n\r\n “Fuller paints this humorist in striking colours, but observes,\r\n ‘that he made his humorsomeness to become him; wherein some of his\r\n profession have rather aped than imitated him, who had morositatem\r\n æquabilem, and kept the tenor of the same surliness to all persons.’\r\n\r\n “The following extracts from _Letters from the Bodleian_, vol. ii.,\r\n will give a notion of his _humour_, and of his mode of treating his\r\n patients.\r\n\r\n “‘Dr. Gale, of St. Paul’s schoole, assures me that a Frenchman came\r\n one time from London to Cambridge, purposely to see him, whom he\r\n made stay two houres for him in his gallery, and then he came out in\r\n an old blue gowne. The French gentleman makes him two or three very\r\n low bowes downe to the ground; Dr. Butler whippes his legge over his\r\n head, and away goes into his chamber, and did not speake with him.\r\n He kept an old mayd, whose name [p340] was Nell. Dr. Butler would\r\n many times goe to the taverne, but drinke by himselfe: about nine or\r\n ten at night, old Nell comes to him with a candle and lanthorne, and\r\n sayes, “Come home, you drunken beast.” By and by Nell would stumble,\r\n then her master calls her “drunken beast;” and so they did “drunken\r\n beast” one another all the way till they came home.’\r\n\r\n “‘The Dr. lyeing at the Savoy in London, next the water side, where\r\n was a balcony look’t into the Thames, a patient came to him that\r\n was grievously tormented with an Ague. The Dr. orders a boate to be\r\n in readinesse under his windowe, and discoursed with the patient (a\r\n gent.) in the balcony, when, on a signal given, two or three lusty\r\n fellows came behind the gent., and threw him a matter of twenty feet\r\n into the Thames. This surprise absolutely cured him.’\r\n\r\n “‘A gent. with a red, ugly, pimpled face, came to him for a cure.\r\n Said the Dr. “I must hang you.” So presently he had a device made\r\n ready to hang him from a beam in the roome; and when he was e’en\r\n almost dead, he cuts the veins that fed these pimples, and lett out\r\n the black ugly blood, and cured him.’\r\n\r\n “Butler must have been a man of abilities, for the Lord Treasurer\r\n Burleigh wrote to the President of the College of Physicians,\r\n desiring that Butler might be allowed to practice in London\r\n occasionally, and he was consulted, with Sir Theodore Mayerne and\r\n others, in the sickness that proved fatal to Prince Henry; and it\r\n is reported that Butler, at first sight of him, gave an unfavorable\r\n prognostic. The account of this case affords such an excellent\r\n notion of the consultations and practise of the doctors of those\r\n days, that I am induced to give it as stated in the ‘Desiderata\r\n Curiosa.’\r\n\r\n “_The Manner of the Sickness and Death of Prince Henry, 6th Nov._\r\n 1612.\r\n\r\n “‘Dr. Atkins, a Physician of London, famous for his practyce,\r\n honestie, and learninge, was sent for to assiste the reste in the\r\n cure.\r\n\r\n “‘He got worse, whereupon bleedinge was again proposed by Dr.\r\n Mayerne, and the favorers thereof, alledging that in this case of\r\n extremity, they must (if they meant to save his life) proceed in the\r\n cure, as though he was some meane person.\r\n\r\n “‘This was not agreed to, and next day, the Physicians, Chirurgeons,\r\n and Apothecaryes seemed to be dismayed, as men perplexed, yet the\r\n most part were of opinion, that the crisis was to been seene before\r\n a final dissolution. _This day a cock was cloven by the backe, and\r\n applyed to the soles of his feete_. But in vayne. Shortly after it\r\n was announced that all hope was gone. His Majestie then gave leave\r\n and absolute power to Dr. Mayerne, to do what he woulde of himselfe,\r\n without advise of the rest; but the Doctor did not it seems like\r\n this, “for hee, weighing the greatness [p341] of the cure and\r\n eminencye of the danger, would not, for all that, adventure to doe\r\n any thinge of himself, without the advice of the rest, saying,\r\n that it should never be said in after ages, that he had kylled the\r\n Kynge’s eldest sonne.”\r\n\r\n “‘Bleeding was again proposed by Mayerne, but Doctors Hamond,\r\n Butler, and Atkins could not agree about it; instead of which they\r\n doubled and tripled the cordials.\r\n\r\n “‘Then came to assist the rest, Dr. Palmer and Dr. Giffard, famous\r\n physicians for their honestie and learninge. The result of this\r\n consultation was _Diascordium_, which was given in the presence of\r\n many honourable gentlemen.\r\n\r\n “‘All sorts of cardials were sent. _Sir Walter Rawleigh_ sent one\r\n from the Tower.’”\r\n\r\n “MRS. MAPP.\r\n\r\n “No part of surgery is supposed to be so easy to understand as\r\n _bone-setting_; it is regarded by a considerable part of the people\r\n as no matter of science, an affair on a level with farriery, as\r\n easily learnt, and like a heritage, to be transmitted from father to\r\n son; in short, the pretensions of these people are very like those\r\n of the man who set up as an oculist, _because_ he had _lost an eye_,\r\n or the rupture doctor, who cured _bursten_ children, _because_ his\r\n grandfather and grandmother were both _bursten_.\r\n\r\n “We are not without plenty of ignorant and impudent pretenders at\r\n the present day, but the celebrated Mrs. Mapp, the bone-setter of\r\n Epsom, surpasses them all. She was the daughter of a man named\r\n Wallis, a bone-setter at Hindon, in Wiltshire, and sister to the\r\n celebrated ‘Polly Peachem,’ who married the Duke of Bolton. Upon\r\n some _family quarrel_, Sally Wallis left her professional parent,\r\n and wandered up and down the country in a miserable manner, calling\r\n herself ‘Crazy Sally,’ and pursuing, in her perambulations, a\r\n course that fairly justified the title. Arriving at last at Epsom,\r\n she succeeded in humbugging the worthy bumpkins of that place so\r\n decidedly, that a subscription was set on foot to keep her among\r\n them; but her fame extending to the metropolis, the dupes of London,\r\n a numerous class then as well as now, thought it no trouble to go\r\n ten miles to see the conjuror, till at length, she was pleased\r\n to bless the afflicted of London with her presence, and once a\r\n week drove to the Grecian Coffee-house, in a coach and six, with\r\n out-riders! and all the appearance of nobility. It was in one of\r\n these journeys, passing through Kent-street, in the Borough, that\r\n being taken for a certain woman of quality from the Electorate in\r\n Germany, a great mob followed, and bestowed on her many bitter\r\n reproaches, till Madame, perceiving some mistake, looked out of the\r\n window, and accosted them in this gentle manner: ‘D—— n your bloods,\r\n don’t you know me? I am Mrs. Mapp, the _bone-setter_!’ upon which,\r\n they instantly changed their revilings into loud huzzas.\r\n\r\n “That she was likely enough to express herself in these terms,\r\n [p342] seems very natural from her origin and history; but that\r\n she should be on visiting terms with decent people, and keep\r\n quality company, is as unnatural. Mr. Pott, who wrote with the pen\r\n of a master, has noticed this in no very gracious terms:—‘We all\r\n remember,’ says he, ‘that even the absurdities and impracticability\r\n of her own promises and engagements, were by no means equal to the\r\n expectations and credulity of those who ran after her; that is,\r\n of all ranks and degrees of people, from the lowest labourer or\r\n mechanic, up to those of the most exalted rank and station; several\r\n of whom not only did not hesitate to believe implicitly the most\r\n extravagant assertions of an ignorant, illiberal, drunken, female\r\n savage, but even solicited her company; at least, seemed to enjoy\r\n her company.’”\r\n\r\n “TAR WATER.\r\n\r\n “Bishop Berkeley, who brought this remedy into fashion, was\r\n greatly aided by the faith of the clergy, who preached it up in\r\n all quarters. Among these, none was more strenuous than Dr. Young,\r\n the author of the ‘Night Thoughts.’ ‘They who have experienced the\r\n wonderful effects of tar water,’ says he, ‘reveal its excellencies\r\n to others. I say reveal, because they are beyond what any can\r\n conceive by reason or natural light. But others disbelieve them,\r\n though the revelation is attested past all scruple, because to them\r\n such strange excellencies are incomprehensible. Now give me leave to\r\n say, that this infidelity may possibly be as fatal to morbid bodies,\r\n as other infidelity to morbid souls. I say this in honest zeal for\r\n your welfare. I am confident, if you persist, you’ll be greatly\r\n benefited by it. In old obstinate chronical complaints, it probably\r\n will not show its virtue under three months; tho’ secretly, it is\r\n doing good all the time.’\r\n\r\n “Such was the universality of its power, that it was good for man\r\n and beast, _and a sure remedy for the plague_!”\r\n\r\nAfter this miscellaneous and amusing collection, we arrive at the\r\nMemoirs, which is not a dry, biographical record of birth, death,\r\nparentage, and education, but a lively sketch of characteristic\r\nparticulars of eminent medical men. We will select a few of them.\r\n\r\n “BUTTER.\r\n\r\n “Mr. John Whitehurst (author of an ingenious theory of the earth)\r\n was the means of Dr. William Butter’s settling at Derby, where he\r\n (Mr. W.) then resided. Mr. Whitehurst had met at Buxton with Lord\r\n Hopetown, who had asked him what physicians were at Derby, and upon\r\n his telling him, that there could not be a finer opening, as the\r\n two physicians there had both declined practice, his Lordship said\r\n it would be a good place for Butter; and shortly afterwards, the\r\n Doctor made his appearance loaded with recommendations, and among\r\n others, with one from Dr. Hope [p343] to Mr. Whitehurst. Mr. W. was\r\n very civil to him, but before he had been a fortnight in the town,\r\n Butter came and complained, that he had not had a single patient.\r\n Mr. W. told him, that he could hardly expect any so soon, that he\r\n must be known a little, and so on, which so offended Butter, that\r\n ever afterwards he considered Mr. W. as his enemy. He was very rude\r\n and coarse in his manner, always averse to consultations, and used\r\n to say, that nobody but himself and Sir John Pringle knew any thing\r\n of physic. Among his patients at Derby were two brothers, opulent\r\n men, who lived together; one of them being dangerously ill, and\r\n attended by Butter, the other brother sent a messenger to Birmingham\r\n for two physicians, and then told Butter what he had done, and\r\n that he intended to have a consultation. Butter immediately went\r\n to the apothecary, and got some laudanum, of which he gave large\r\n doses to the patient, so that when the Birmingham physicians came,\r\n the patient was in a state of lethargy. They asked if he had been\r\n taking opium, but Butter denied that any had been given; it was\r\n accidentally discovered, however, by means of the apothecary, and\r\n from that time Butter, who was before in excellent practice, lost\r\n considerably in public estimation.\r\n\r\n “A tailor at Derby, whom Butter had offended, once played him\r\n a trick. A curer of smoky chimnies came to Derby, and one day,\r\n when the tailor knew the Doctor was out of town, he called on the\r\n chimney-man, and told him that Butter had desired to have a smoky\r\n chimney cured, belonging to his best parlour; and had left positive\r\n orders that he should go to his house and set about it immediately.\r\n The operator accordingly went, delivered his message to Butter’s\r\n servant, pulled out his utensils, and fell to work; and in a short\r\n time the marble slab, and other ornaments of the chimney, were down.\r\n Butter came in while he was engaged in this business; finding his\r\n parlour full of bricks and dirt and mortar, his fury was excessive,\r\n and his hatred to the tailor was ever after implacable. The story\r\n got wind in the town, and the boys in the street would sometimes\r\n talk about _chimney-doctors_ as he passed.\r\n\r\n “Butter lived close to a churchyard, and one day, seeing a\r\n grave-digger at work, he asked him for whom he was digging the\r\n grave—‘For so and so,’ said the grave-digger, naming the tailor who\r\n had so highly offended him, which so pleased the Doctor, that he\r\n gave the fellow a shilling. This occasioned a fresh laugh at his\r\n expense, as the tailor was in good health, and it was merely a piece\r\n of pleasantry of the grave-digger’s. Butter and his wife lived in\r\n the most frugal manner, and never visited anybody. After he came to\r\n London, a lady of fortune, who had been his patient in Derbyshire,\r\n and wished to countenance him, invited him often to her table, till\r\n at length Butter brought in an account of fees for each visit.”\r\n [p344]\r\n\r\n “CADOGAN.\r\n\r\n “Universal temperance in eating and drinking has been considered\r\n as particularly incumbent on a physician, in every period of his\r\n practice. It is a virtue he is frequently obliged to inculcate on\r\n his patients; and his doctrines will have little effect if they be\r\n not regularly exemplified in his own conduct.\r\n\r\n “Dr. Cadogan, however, thought it right to _try all things_, and\r\n considered it his duty to speak _experimentally_ on both sides of\r\n the question, to qualify himself to say, in the language of Dido,—\r\n\r\n ‘Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco.’\r\n\r\n “Thus, dining one day at a College dinner, after discoursing most\r\n elegantly and forcibly on abstinence, temperance, and particularly\r\n against pie-crust and pastry, he is reported to have addressed a\r\n brother M.D. in the following terms: ‘Pray, doctor, is that a pigeon\r\n pie near you?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘Then I will thank you to send me the\r\n hind-quarters of two pigeons, some fat of the beef-steak, a good\r\n portion of the pudding-crust, and as much gravy as you can spare!’”\r\n\r\n “BLAIR.\r\n\r\n “‘We physicians were always politicians,’ was a favourite expression\r\n of Warren’s, but nevertheless, there are very few instances of\r\n medical men embroiling themselves in political troubles.\r\n\r\n “Dr. Patrick Blair, however, who was in the rebellion of 1745, got\r\n himself into Newgate, and was condemned to be hanged. In the British\r\n Museum are several of his letters to Sir Hans Sloane, written in\r\n prison, soliciting his intercession, and in one of them he writes,\r\n ‘If you come towards Newgate, I hope you will favour me with a\r\n call.’ Dr. Martyn, the professor of Botany at Cambridge, supped with\r\n him in Newgate the night previous to his expected execution. Blair\r\n had been all along confident that he should be reprieved: Dr. Martyn\r\n said, he sat pretty quietly till the clock struck nine, and then he\r\n got up and walked about the room; at ten he quickened his pace; and\r\n at twelve, no reprieve coming, he cried out—‘By my troth! this is\r\n carrying the jest too far!’ The reprieve, however, came soon after,\r\n and in due time a pardon. Blair went afterwards, and settled at\r\n Boston in Lincolnshire, where he practised till his death.”\r\n\r\n “SIR WILLIAM DUNCAN.\r\n\r\n “Sir William Duncan once met Dr. Thomas Reeve, when the latter was\r\n President of the College, and insisted that his name should not\r\n follow Reeve’s, because he was physician to the king. Reeve asserted\r\n his dignity as president, and the consequence was, that each wrote\r\n his own prescription (the same they had agreed to) and gave it to\r\n the apothecary.\r\n\r\n “There are many instances of medical etiquette being carried to a\r\n great extent, but polite etiquette in a sick room was perhaps [p345]\r\n never exceeded by the following exhibition of it, between the Duke\r\n of Ormond and a German Baron.\r\n\r\n “The Duke of Ormond and a certain German Baron were both considered\r\n models of pride and politeness. When the Duke perceived that he\r\n was dying, he desired that he might be seated in his elbow chair,\r\n and then, turning to the Baron, with great _courteousness_, he\r\n requested that he would excuse any unseemly contortions of feature,\r\n as his physicians assured him, that he must soon struggle with the\r\n last pangs. ‘My dear Lord Duke,’ replied the Baron, with equal\r\n _politeness_, ‘I beg you will be on no ceremony on my account!’”\r\n\r\n “BAILLIE,\r\n\r\n “Not Matthew Baillie, but an Irish gentleman who had been rejected\r\n by the College, called the next day on Dr. Barrowby, who was one of\r\n the censors, and insisted upon his fighting him. Barrowby, who was a\r\n little puny man, declined it. ‘I am only the third censor,’ said he,\r\n ‘in point of age—you must first call out your own countryman, Sir\r\n Hans Sloane, our president, and when you have fought him and the two\r\n senior censors, then I shall be ready to meet you.’\r\n\r\n “Many medical duels have been prevented by the difficulty of\r\n arranging the ‘methodus pugnandi.’ In the instance of Dr.\r\n Brocklesby, the number of paces could not be agreed upon; and in\r\n the affair between Akenside and Ballow, one had determined never to\r\n fight in the morning, and the other that he would never fight in the\r\n afternoon. John Wilkes, who did not stand upon ceremony in these\r\n little affairs, when asked by Lord Talbot, ‘How many times they were\r\n to fire?’ replied, ‘Just as often as your Lordship pleases; I have\r\n brought _a bag of bullets and a flask of gunpowder_.’”\r\n\r\n “WOODVILLE.\r\n\r\n “Dr. Joseph Adams, who was much with Woodville just before his\r\n death, used to relate several traits of his firmness and seeming\r\n unconcern with respect to death. Woodville lived in lodgings at a\r\n carpenter’s in Ely-place, and Adams, a few days before his death,\r\n advised the matron of the Small-pox Hospital to invite him to have\r\n a bed made up there, that he might be better attended to: this she\r\n did, and Woodville accepted it. He observed to Adams, the next day,\r\n that he was a poor man come to die at the hospital, and he remarked,\r\n that some of those who called on him flattered him with hopes of\r\n his getting better. ‘But I am not so silly,’ he said, ‘as to mind\r\n what they say; I know my own case too well, and that I am dying. A\r\n younger man with better stamina might think it hard to die; but why\r\n should I regret leaving such a diseased, worn-out carcase as mine?’\r\n\r\n “The carpenter with whom he lodged had not been always on the best\r\n terms with him; Woodville said he should wish to [p346] let the\r\n man see that he died in peace with him, and as he never had much\r\n occasion to employ him, desired he might be sent for to come and\r\n measure him for his coffin. This was done; the carpenter came, and\r\n took measure of the Doctor, who begged him not to be more than two\r\n days about it; ‘For,’ said he, ‘I shall not live beyond that time;’\r\n and he did actually die just before the end of the next day. He\r\n got between one and two thousand pounds by his Medical Botany, and\r\n with the money bought a small estate, which he left to his natural\r\n daughter, being all the property he possessed.”\r\n\r\nWe happen to know this fact, and moreover, that the Doctor was\r\nplaying at chess when the carpenter was introduced to measure him\r\nfor his wooden surtout. “Mr. ——,” said the Doctor, “you come at the\r\nproper season, for _my game is nearly finished!”_\r\n\r\nThe work is embellished with three etchings, which remind us that Mr.\r\nWadd not only uses the pen, but the pencil, with facility and taste.\r\nHis published works afford ample proof of his power of _illustrating_\r\nmorbid anatomy, but we happen to know of some _unpublished folio\r\nproofs_ of equal merit. To his fair fame as a surgeon, by the works\r\nwe have just noticed, he may add the reputation of being one of the\r\nmost vivacious literary _illustrators_ of his art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _On Tic Douloureux_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nPRESUMING that popular and domestic medicine may occasionally find a\r\nniche in your Journal, I beg to offer a few remarks upon the above\r\ncomplaint, which has lately become, as it would appear at least,\r\nsingularly prevalent; and as I address myself to general readers,\r\nI shall avoid all learned terms of art, and minute descriptions\r\nrequiring them. The genuine tic douloureux is usually considered\r\nas a morbid affection of the nerves of the face, very commonly\r\nattacking the circumference of the orbit, and producing frequent\r\nand violent paroxysms of excruciating pain; the disease, however,\r\nvaries considerably in intensity, and sometimes bears the same\r\nname when attacking other parts; it frequently occurs under the\r\ninteguments of the head, and may or may not be attended with external\r\ntenderness. Though opiates relieve the pain, they are ineffectual as\r\nto its cure. Peruvian bark, in [p347] various forms, has sometimes\r\nafforded relief, and preparations containing the metallic tonics,\r\nmore especially the oxides of iron, have been regarded as giving\r\nmore permanent and beneficial assistance. Local remedies are of very\r\nuncertain utility, and electricity and galvanism have generally done\r\nmore harm than good. The division of the nerves has been resorted\r\nto, but never with permanent, and often not even with temporary\r\nbenefit. The cause of the disease is unknown, and though sometimes\r\norganic derangement would appear to excite it, no plausible source\r\nof the mischief can usually be discovered. The patient’s principal\r\nsolace is that the disorder frequently wears itself out, and as far\r\nas my experience goes, the less we rely upon individual remedies, the\r\nbetter—the main thing being strict attention to the general health,\r\nand especially to the state of the stomach and bowels. These remarks\r\napply to the genuine Tic Douloureux; but it has of late years been\r\nthe fashion in physic to give that alarming name to a variety of\r\npainful affections, resulting from very various causes, by which\r\nmuch needless uneasiness has been given to the patient, and which\r\nhas often led to erroneous and even mischievous systems of practical\r\ntreatment. As cases of this kind are of every day occurrence, a short\r\nnotice of them can scarcely be inappropriate to a Journal, the chief\r\nobject of which is to familiarize every branch of science.\r\n\r\nRheumatic affections of the head and face often put on the appearance\r\nof Tic; like it, they come on at short intervals, and are limited\r\nto a small space; there is, generally, more or less of external\r\ntenderness, sometimes confined to spots upon the face and scalp, not\r\nlarger than a shilling; at others, more diffused. More or less of\r\nthis is usually attendant upon habits subject to chronic rheumatism,\r\nand it not uncommonly is the leading feature of the complaint. The\r\ninternal use of opiates and sudorifics, especially small doses of\r\nDover’s powder, warm fomentations, and keeping the head, especially\r\nat night, wrapped up in flannel, are sovereign remedies.\r\n\r\nBut the most common cases of painful affections, mistaken for\r\nTic, are those which occur in nervous and irritable persons, and\r\nespecially amongst men of business, statesmen, lawyers, merchants,\r\nover-studious persons, and all whose minds are [p348] occasionally\r\nexercised beyond their powers, who are subject to reverses of\r\nfortune, or sudden changes in the posture of their affairs, and who\r\nare constant objects of public attention, praise, or censure. For a\r\ntime, the constitution, if a good one, bears up against such wear\r\nand tear, but as you advance, one or other symptom of a shattered\r\nnervous system appears, and this, more quickly and certainly, where\r\nthe body has been pampered by too good living, false spirits excited\r\nby indulgence in wine, and fatigue relieved by narcotics, instead of\r\nsleep. Among the host of disordered affections to which such persons\r\nare liable, violent local nervous pains are most common, but they are\r\ninvariably relieved by such means as contribute to quiet the mind and\r\ninvigorate the body. Abstinence from business, retirement into the\r\ncountry, regular hours, plain food, moderate exercise, and avoiding\r\nexcitement, are here certain remedies, and indeed the only ones, but\r\nthey are unfortunately not always easy of attainment, and sometimes\r\naltogether unattainable. I have, however, mentioned these cases, to\r\nenjoin an early attention to the overhanging evil, and to criticise\r\nits improper treatment. I would, upon the first point, enjoin early\r\nattention to the first symptoms, and when they appear let the\r\nindividual seriously ask himself whether it be worth while to gain\r\na little more money, glory, or honour, or renown, at the expense of\r\nall future comfort, and a painful, wearisome, and probably shortened\r\nexistence; or whether such apparent advantages had not better be at\r\nonce conceded, and the host of evils, which will almost certainly\r\nensue, warded off by a timely retirement? I could illustrate this\r\nsubject by reference to many individuals, especially in the legal\r\nand medical professions, some of whom are harassing themselves to\r\ndeath by over-exertion, whilst others (I regret to say but few) are\r\npreserving a healthy constitution, by sacrificing a certain share\r\nof fame and emolument: the exceeding folly, too, of persevering in\r\nbusiness, when neither mental nor bodily powers are adequate to the\r\nexertion, might here be animadverted on, but I must, for the present,\r\nwaive such topics, and return to the treatment of those nervous\r\npains called Tic Douloureux, which are of such common occurrence in\r\nthe cases alluded to. These will certainly give way under [p349]\r\nthat quiet and retirement which has been above recommended; but it\r\nis really provoking to see such means so commonly neglected, and\r\nthe unfortunate patients tormented by blisters, fomentations, and\r\ngalvanism, and their already debilitated stomachs further overpowered\r\nby gigantic doses of powdered bark, rust of iron, and other (in such\r\ncases) equally ineffective and hurtful medicines. I write to warn\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Peruvian bark as a remedy in tic douloureux. Where\r\nthe painful affection so called, let it arise from what cause it\r\nmay, assumes an intermitting form,—and nothing is more common than\r\nto have it coming on at stated periods, generally one violent attack\r\nin the twenty-four hours,—in such, as in other similar cases, bark\r\nhas often been effective; but of late, sulphate of quinine has very\r\nproperly been substituted for it; and as this extremely curious and\r\nvaluable medicine is now in every one’s hands, and even finding its\r\nway into family medicine chests, a few words respecting its use, or\r\nrather abuse, may not be here misplaced. I would first remark, that\r\nit is too commonly given in over-doses: it then produces thirst,\r\nand a white tongue, and, what is remarkable, it excites in most\r\npeople that uneasy sensation of fulness about the stomach, which is\r\ngenerally complained of after a large dose of powdered bark, and\r\nascribed to the indigestible nature of the large quantity of inert\r\nand insoluble woody fibre in which that substance abounds. For these\r\nreasons sulphate of quinine is too often laid aside in cases where,\r\nif properly and judiciously administered, it might prove of important\r\nservice; instead of three or four grains, or even more, repeated\r\nevery four or six hours, let a grain be given once a day; and if\r\nit agree, and occasion require, let this dose be repeated twice or\r\nthrice daily, either in the form of pill or solution. I prefer the\r\nlatter; two drachms of tincture of orange-peel being used as the\r\nsolvent, and diluted afterwards with half a wine-glass of water. It\r\nis not meant here to insinuate, that in obstinate agues, and other\r\ndisorders, large doses of quinine are always improper, but to enforce\r\nthe occasional mischief which they produce, and by which the medicine\r\nis unjustly brought into distrust and disrepute.\r\n\r\nDecayed teeth are fertile sources of pains and twitches [p350] about\r\nthe facial nerves and muscles, analogous to Tic; and great irritation\r\nfrom inflamed membranes of some cavity in the upper jaw has also\r\noccasioned them. I knew a person who suffered six months from such an\r\nattack, and for whom a physician prescribed, in the course of that\r\nperiod, some pounds of carbonate of iron. Symptoms then ensued, for\r\nwhich a course of sarsaparilla was ordered, but it was of no avail.\r\nMercurials were then given, with manifest mischief. The extraction\r\nof the second grinder effected a permanent cure; its roots were\r\nconnected with a cavity of fetid discharge, which had no sooner vent,\r\nthan all the symptoms disappeared.\r\n\r\nWithout exceeding the limits which I have set myself, I cannot\r\nproceed farther in these remarks; but I hope enough has been said to\r\nquiet the apprehensions of some invalids who suffer themselves to\r\nbe exceedingly alarmed at the name given to their complaint, and to\r\nbe dosed with large quantities of useless medicines, which rather\r\naggravate than relieve it. In many of these cases, the less that is\r\ndone the better; in all of them, careful reference must be had to\r\nthe real exciting cause; and, in addition to the other circumstances\r\nadverted to, a strict attention to diet must be enforced, and more\r\nthan ordinary watchfulness exerted over the state of the stomach\r\nand bowels: plain roast and boiled, and no grease or piecrust in\r\nthe former; and for the latter, an occasional blue pill and a tea\r\nspoonful of Epsom salt.\r\n\r\n MEDICUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Remarks on some Quadrupeds supposed by Naturalists to be extinct_.\r\n By John Ranking, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is not any part of the creation more interesting to mankind\r\nthan the gigantic classes of quadrupeds. In them, we are able to\r\ncontemplate the power of the Creator of all things, in one of the\r\nmost magnificent exercises of his will. Such, however, is the limit\r\nto this kind of knowledge, that there is probably not any one class,\r\neven of the largest quadrupeds, all the _species_ of which are, or\r\npossibly ever can be, known to the student of natural history. More\r\nthan half of [p351] the surface of the earth is still undiscovered\r\nby the civilised portion of its inhabitants: regions as extensive\r\nas Europe, in Asia, Africa, and America, are, at this time, either\r\nwholly unknown or undescribed.\r\n\r\nThe imperfection of history is such, that the most civilised ancient\r\nstates of the world have left little behind but what may be called\r\nfragments of their annals. If we include the Gothic age, as it is\r\ncalled, from the fifth to the fifteenth century, there are not less,\r\nout of the fifty-eight centuries which the earth is said to have\r\nexisted, than forty of them which may be termed a blank, as far as\r\nregards profane and natural knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe period assigned to the Deluge is seventeen centuries after the\r\ncreation, or upwards of four thousand years past. There are not any\r\nknown real historical annals that can contest this event, and the\r\nnatural state of the earth offers abundant proofs of its reality.\r\nUnder all these considerations, the fossil remains of elephants and\r\nother large quadrupeds, known to have been employed or slain by\r\nthe Romans and Moguls, may justly be considered as independent of\r\nany relation to that catastrophe, and in no wise concerned in the\r\ndiscussion. Established truths are rather disturbed and weakened by\r\narguments which are open to refutation.\r\n\r\nThe time is not distant when it will be generally acknowledged that\r\nall those kinds of quadrupeds, the remains of which have been found\r\nat the very places mentioned in history, are still in existence; a\r\nfact which, when proved, will be of infinitely greater interest as\r\nit regards so grand a portion of nature, than the single supposition\r\nthat they are all extinct, because we are not acquainted with the\r\nexact species which corresponds with many of the fossil kinds\r\nfrequently discovered: this being the foundation on which such a\r\nconclusion is principally built.\r\n\r\nNaturalists have endeavoured to prove that such bones are found where\r\nthey could only have been placed by the Deluge: but the changes in\r\nthe surface from deposits by rivers, earthquakes, and imperceptible\r\nalterations from the accretion of vegetable matter, and from dust,\r\nvolcanoes, digging of mines, wells, canals, foundations, and other\r\ndisturbances of the soil, [p352] are such as cannot be observed or\r\nregistered; and a few lines will prove how difficult and uncertain\r\nthis part of the question remains to this day.\r\n\r\n“In quarrying limestone at Aix, in Provence, A.D. 1788, under eleven\r\nstrata, separated from each other by a bed of sand and clay, at the\r\ndepth of forty-five feet, the surface was covered with shells. The\r\nstones of this bed being removed, under a stratum of argillaceous\r\nsand, stumps of columns and fragments of stones, like the quarry,\r\nhalf wrought, were found; and also coins, handles of hammers, and\r\na board, one inch thick and seven feet long, broken, but all the\r\npieces there, and could be joined; it was like the boards used by\r\nquarry-men, and worn in the same manner. The pieces of wood were\r\nchanged into _agate_[53].”\r\n\r\n“On sinking a well on a hill near Tobolsk, sixty-four _fathoms_ deep\r\nin the earth, an oaken beam was found; it was quite black, and not\r\nround but shaped[54].”\r\n\r\n“At Watlington-park, Oxfordshire, at fifty or sixty feet depth, many\r\nwhole oaks, hazel-nuts, a stag’s-head and antlers, were found, and on\r\nthe same spot two Roman urns[55].”\r\n\r\n“In Oxfordshire there is a tumulus which has become a perfect mount\r\nof stone.”\r\n\r\n“Ralph, the brother of Earl Widdrington, showed me many _human_\r\nbones taken from whole skeletons, with British beads, chains, iron\r\nrings, and brass bits of bridles, dug up in a _quarry_ at Blankney,\r\nLincolnshire, which was probably plain mould when these old corpses\r\nof the Britons were interred: and I Saw many _human_ bones and\r\narmour, with Roman coins, fibluæ &c., found in a _stone_-pit in\r\nHunstanton-park, Norfolk, belonging to Sir Nicholas L’Estrange[56].”\r\n\r\nVery numerous instances could be added, in order to prove that\r\nthe local circumstances, when skeletons of these quadrupeds are\r\nfound, are not of a nature to disprove the _historical_ origin of\r\nfossil bones. From the highest authority we learn, that the “bones\r\nof species which are apparently the same with [p353] those that\r\nstill exist alive, are never found except in the latest alluvial\r\ndepositions, or in the fissures of caverns and rocks, in places where\r\nthey may have been overwhelmed by debris, or even buried by man[57].”\r\n\r\nThus it appears that a comparative view of the exact _species_ now\r\nliving, with that of the fossil remains, is what we must depend on to\r\ndecide whether the fossil kinds may not be still in existence.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the very numerous theories of the earth, the\r\nlast, by Werner, has been confidently quoted in opposition to the\r\nwriter’s historical proofs[58]. But Werner himself, before his\r\ndeath (in 1817), tacitly acknowledged that it is not a tenable\r\ndoctrine, and which is clearly indicated by the compilers of REES’s\r\n_Cyclopedia_[59], although it is generally allowed to be the best\r\nextant. This hypothesis was formed on a circumscribed view of the\r\nstrata in Saxony, but it is found to be quite inapplicable, in\r\nAmerica for instance[60]. To account for fossil bones of elephants,\r\n&c., being found high in the north, the American author who\r\ndiscovered this defect in the geological doctrine, conjectures that\r\nthose large quadrupeds may have migrated, like the buffalos, during\r\nthe change of seasons. This notion, however, would not apply to Asia,\r\nthe native countries of those animals being well supplied with leaves\r\nor other food the year round.\r\n\r\nWith these prefatory remarks some historical proofs are offered, for\r\nthe probability of the following animals found in a fossil state, not\r\nbeing of extinct species, beginning with the\r\n\r\n\r\n ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n“On sinking the foundation for a mill, near the side of a small brook\r\nin the Bishop of Kilmore’s lands, at Maghery, [p354] eight miles from\r\nBelturbet, in the north of Ireland, A.D. 1715, four large teeth were\r\nfound, with a piece of the under jawbone and part of the skull of a\r\nyoung elephant. The teeth were more solid and petrified than when in\r\na natural state.”\r\n\r\n [Illustration: A]\r\n\r\nFig. A is one of the above grinders. B is a fossil grinder in the\r\npossession of the Royal Society. C is the grinder of an elephant\r\nbetween 10 and 11 feet high, the entire skull of which was then in\r\nWestminster[61].\r\n\r\n [Illustration: B]\r\n\r\n [Illustration: C]\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that two _fossil_ elephants are of the same\r\nspecies as those now in existence.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the Maghery animal was conveyed to Ireland\r\nas a present, or for exhibition. “Fiacra, son of Eacha Moymedon, was\r\nmortally wounded at the battle of Caonry, which was fought A.D. 380,\r\nwherein he was victorious against the army of Momonia, (Munster). On\r\nhis return to Hy-mac-uais, in _Meath_, he died of his wounds. His\r\nfuneral [p355] leacht was erected, and on his tomb was inscribed his\r\nname in the Ogham character[62].”\r\n\r\nWe here find that the native sovereign of the northern part of\r\nIreland resided in Meath, the borders of which county are not\r\nmany miles from the place where the elephant was found. It was at\r\nabout the year of the battle of Caonry that Maximus, the emperor\r\nin Britain, aspired to be master of the Roman empire. Finding the\r\nunion of the Scots and Picts prevented his peaceable possession of\r\nBritain, which was a great obstacle to the execution of his project,\r\nhe persuaded the Picts to join their forces to his, on the promise of\r\ngiving them the lands of the Scots. The Scots were thus overpowered,\r\nand were forced to fly to Ireland and the adjacent isles. The Scots,\r\nbeing assisted by the Irish, invaded the north, and were driven\r\nback to Ireland by Maximus, at the head of his troops. The emperor\r\nthreatened to invade Ireland, and punish the Irish; but the dread\r\nthey had of the presence of a Roman army, induced them to grant\r\nMaximus his own terms, which, in order to conciliate all parties,\r\nwere moderate[63]. Now it is by no means impossible that the British\r\nemperor, on this conciliating occasion, sent this very elephant to\r\nhis Irish majesty. Tacitus observes, that Agricola (three centuries\r\nbefore Maximus) received an expelled petty king of Ireland into his\r\nprotection; that in manners the natives vary little from the Britons;\r\nand that _the ports and landings of Ireland are better known, through\r\nthe frequency of commerce and merchants, than those of Britain_[64].\r\n\r\n\r\n THE MASTODON.\r\n\r\nThis quadruped is now known not to differ from the elephant, except\r\nin the form of the grinders, and has probably been called by the name\r\nof elephant by the Romans. Remains of the mastodon have been found\r\nmixed with those of the elephant, in Europe, Siberia, and America;\r\nand for the following [p356] reasons there is every probability of\r\nthis animal being in existence.\r\n\r\nCaptain C. S. Cochrane, in his _Journal in Colombia_, vol. ii., p.\r\n390, relates that numbers of the _carnivorous_ elephants have been\r\nseen feeding on the plains at the foot of a ridge of mountains, at\r\nChoco, in New Granada. “Part of the foot of a mastodon, with five\r\nnails attached, was found in a cave, with a tooth, by a savage west\r\nof the Missouri: it was very fresh, and perfectly resembling that of\r\nan elephant: it was obtained of a Mexican, who had purchased it of a\r\nnative[65].”\r\n\r\n“The native Americans describe the elephant as still existing in the\r\nnorthern parts of their country (the Missouri).”—Mr. Jefferson’s\r\n_Notes on Virginia_, p. 57.\r\n\r\nMany bones of the mastodon were found in the county of Wythe,\r\nVirginia, with a mass of half-ground branches, roots, and leaves,\r\nenclosed in a kind of sack, supposed to be the stomach, in the midst\r\nof them; so as to leave no doubt that they were substances which the\r\nanimal had devoured, and among them were distinguishable the remains\r\nof some plants known in Virginia[66]. Teeth of the mastodon have\r\nbeen found in Little Tartary, (for five centuries possessed by the\r\nMoguls,) in Siberia, near the Oural mountains, and one at Harwich, in\r\nEngland[67].\r\n\r\nThere, have been brought from Ava, found on the left bank of the\r\nIrawaddy, in N. lat. 20° to 21°, near the wells of petroleum, in\r\nnarrow ravines, sand-hills, beds of gravel, ironstone, and calcareous\r\nbreccia, evidently a _diluvial_ formation,—fossil bones, shells, and\r\nwood. Bones of the mastodon, equal in size to those of the Ohio,\r\na grinder 16-1/2 inches in circumference, a humerus, measuring 25\r\ninches round the condyles, with several [p357] grinders and bones\r\nof younger individuals, and fragments of tusks: fossil molares of\r\nthe rhinoceros, resembling two species of a genus named by Cuvier\r\nAnthracotherium: bones like an animal of the horse kind: remains of\r\ncrocodiles, supposed to be the gavial, or long-nosed alligator of the\r\nGanges, (not now known in the rivers of Ava.) The fossil bones were\r\nupon or near the surface, more or less exposed, not decomposed or\r\nrolled, and are of animals that died there. The bones are petrified,\r\nand deeply coloured with iron, the substance siliceous and very\r\nhard. The blocks of wood are larger than the trees growing there,\r\nbut it is not known if they are of the same kind. “An idle notion is\r\nentertained by many, that these fossil remains have been generated by\r\na petrifying quality in the water of the Irawaddy[68], but I think\r\nthey are the result, as elsewhere, of one of the last catastrophes;\r\nin fact, the remains of a former world, before man was called into\r\nexistence.”—_Morning Herald_, Sept. 14, 1827.\r\n\r\nBones of the mastodon have been found in Europe, mixed with menagerie\r\ncollections, which cannot possibly be attributed to any other origin\r\nthan that of sports of the amphitheatre. They are found in western\r\nSiberia, which was conquered by Sheibani, Genghis Khan’s grandson,\r\nA.D. 1242, and held 300 years, and whose first capital was at\r\nTiumin[69], on the river Tura, near the Ural mountains, where the\r\nremains of the mastodon were found. Ava was conquered by the Grand\r\nKhan Kublai in 1272, in a battle with the king of eastern Bengal,\r\nin which there were a thousand elephants[70]. The places where they\r\nhave been found in America correspond with history and tradition so\r\nfaithfully, as to assist the other numerous proofs of Mexico and\r\nPeru having been conquered by the Moguls, in the year 1283, and\r\nthe bones of the mastodon are there found, as well as remains of\r\n_elephants, precisely like those of Siberia_[71]. With regard to the\r\ntooth found at Harwich, the [p358] British kings Cuneboline[72] and\r\nArviragus had representations of elephants on their coins. The bones\r\nof elephants, rhinoceroses, and crocodiles found in Ava are not,\r\nas those found in Europe and Siberia, what are termed _extraneous_\r\nfossils; the same kinds of animals being natives of the spot in Ava.\r\nThe one like the horse cannot be ascertained; but the kings of Pegu,\r\nin former times, had camelopards, and, therefore, probably, zebras in\r\ntheir _calichars_, or parks; they also had _unicorns_, ostriches, and\r\nrein-deer[73]. Timur Khan, grandson of Kublai, who invaded Siberia\r\nwith such powerful armies, resided at Tali, in Yunan, N. lat. 25°\r\neast of the Irawaddy[74].\r\n\r\nThe writer is of opinion that all those fossil bones found in Ava are\r\nof species still in existence: they may have floated down from more\r\nnorthern parts, the river in question being as long as the Ganges,\r\nsaid to be navigable into China; and has its source in Thibet,—(see\r\nRENNELL’s _Memoir_, p. 217.) According to the hypothesis of the\r\nwriter, Montezuma’s ancestor was a Mongul grandee from Assam; and\r\nmastodontes’ remains have been found in Mexico, and those beasts are,\r\nas above related, supposed to be found alive near the Missouri.\r\n\r\nThis is the first instance the writer has met with of similar bones\r\nnot being _extraneous_; and is, therefore, a remarkable fact, which\r\nexcites the strongest suspicion that their species are still living.\r\nAva is a new world on a small scale, and this collection of bones\r\nwill, very probably, at no distant date, lead to positive proof of\r\nthe existence of other quadrupeds, now conjectured by naturalists\r\nto be extinct. With respect to the local position, it is in all\r\nprobability the old bed of the river, as [p359] the beds of those in\r\nAsia change in a wonderful manner.—(See _Rennell_, p. 255.)\r\n\r\nA skeleton of an elephant or mastodon, for it is not known which,\r\nwas found in a tomb in Mexico, which had evidently been built on\r\npurpose.—(_Clavigero_, vol. i., p. 84.) No authority whatever\r\ndates the foundation of Mexico earlier than A.D. 1324. The Aztecs\r\nadvanced from Culiacan, when they took possession of the marshes,\r\nand founded Mexico: other Aztecs had preceded them who had arrived\r\nby land; but the writer hazarded a theory[75] that _Montezuma’s_\r\nancestors had, like those of the Natchez and of the Incas, arrived\r\nin America by _sea_ with elephants, under Mango Capac; and he has\r\nhad the satisfaction to find a confirmation of his conjectures in\r\na _decade_ written by Peter Martyr, the Milanese, (employed by\r\nFerdinand V., King of Castile and Arragon, and who died in the year\r\n1526,) addressed to Adrian VI., who had been co-regent of Spain with\r\nCardinal Ximenes. “Montezuma spoke thus to Cortez:—We have heard\r\nby our ancestors that we are strangers. A certain great prince, in\r\n_ships_, before the memory of all men living, brought our ancestors\r\nunto these coasts; whether voluntarily or driven by tempest it\r\nis not manifest; who, leaving his companions, departed into his\r\ncountry, and, at length returning, would have had them to have gone\r\nback again. But they had built houses, and joining themselves with\r\nthe women of the country had begotten children, and had settled.\r\nWherefore our ancestors, having chosen a senate and princes to\r\ngovern the people, refused to go, and he departed with threatening\r\nspeeches. Never any appeared unto this time who denied the right of\r\nthat captain and commander. We think, therefore, that the king who\r\nsent you derived his descent from him, and all the kingdoms which we\r\npossess are yours[76].” It is impossible to know clearly what the\r\nallusions to the return of the great commander may mean, but whatever\r\nit be, it does not change the date. As the Mexicans considered\r\nCortez to be a child of the sun, the _great prince_ must have been a\r\ndescendant from Genghis Khan; and _thence_ the [p360] terrors and\r\nsubmission of Montezuma and the Mexicans, who had always dreaded such\r\na visit.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs had sojourned in Culiacan and other places, from the date\r\nof the arrival of the ships, till they proceeded to Anahuac. The\r\nfoundation of Tenochtitlan (or Mexico) having been in 1324, and the\r\nfirst king, Montezuma’s ancestor, elected in 1377; therefore, the\r\nempire, when Montezuma died, had lasted only 144 years; and this\r\ncalculation is from the most authentic documents known, that is, the\r\npictures in Purchas’s collection. In Harris’s _Voyages_, vol. ii., p.\r\n97, Montezuma is said to have told Cortez, that it was only a century\r\nsince they had been settled where they were, meaning, probably, that\r\nit was not _two_ centuries.\r\n\r\nThus an elephant being found in a tomb in Mexico, and others in tombs\r\nin Siberia, is an additional argument to the strong ones already\r\nproduced, for the Mexicans being the Moguls blown from the shores of\r\nJapan, A.D. 1283, which appears irresistible; and also that mammoths\r\nand mastodontes are not extinct, being found either living or fossil\r\nin all the places in America, which agree with the traditions on that\r\nsubject, and with the histories of China and Japan[77].\r\n\r\n\r\n THE TAPIR.\r\n\r\nThe Tapir was supposed to be peculiar to the New World: two fossil\r\nspecies, one of them gigantic, have been found in [p361] France,\r\nGermany; and Italy[78]. The remains of a tapir being found at\r\nFlorence, with those of other quadrupeds usually exhibited by the\r\nRomans, was an unaccountable fact, till it was known, through Sir\r\nStamford Raffles, that the tapir exists in Sumatra. We know that the\r\nRomans carried on a commerce with India, which employed _one hundred\r\nand twenty ships annually_, and that they had the power of being\r\nsupplied with all the animals of those regions, by means of country\r\nships, which traded to the ports of Musiris and Barace, those which\r\nthe Romans frequented. Moreover, the author of the _Periplus_, p.\r\n36, describes _Sumatra_. It appears, therefore, evident that the\r\nRomans procured tapirs from that island, if they be not inhabitants\r\nof Africa. The British king, father of Caractacus, had a tapir on\r\none of his numerous coins[79]; which may be reckoned among many\r\nother proofs that the ancient Britons were not quite so ignorant and\r\nbarbarous as is generally, but unjustly, imagined. The discovery of\r\nthis tapir shows how little is yet known even of those countries in\r\nwhich Britain has, for a length of years, had establishments. The\r\ntapir is probably what the natives have reported as a _river-horse_,\r\na much more appropriate name for it than for the African beast. “The\r\ndescriptions of the hippopotamus,” says Baron Cuvier, “by Herodotus\r\nand Aristotle, are supposed to have been borrowed from Hecatæus of\r\nMiletus, and must have been taken from two very different animals,\r\none of which is the true hippopotamus, and the other the _antelope\r\ngnu_ of Gmelin[80].” Now, as it appears that the Indians described by\r\nHerodotus by the name _Padæi_, is an exact account of the _Batta_ in\r\nSumatra,—(Dr. Leyden thinks them the same word, as the Indo-Chinese\r\npronounce B as P[81],)—it is rendered probable that that island was\r\nknown to the Greeks, long before the Romans possessed Egypt. On these\r\ngrounds, I venture a conjecture that Aristotle and Herodotus alluded\r\nto the tapir, which is _amphibious_, but the gnu is not. The tapir\r\nis probably the _küda-ayer_ of Sumatra, and the _conda-aijeer_, or\r\n_river paard_, of the [p362] Javans.—(See MARSDEN’s _Sumatra_, third\r\nedition.) With respect to the _gigantic_ tapir, it is as probable\r\nthat those regions (apparently less known to moderns, as regards\r\nzoology, than to the Greeks and Romans) may contain gigantic tapirs\r\nas ouranoutangs, near eight feet high, so lately discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n UNICORN.\r\n\r\nMany reasons have been given, in another place[82], to prove the\r\nprobability of the existence of the unicorn, since which the\r\nfollowing description of two has been met with.\r\n\r\n “On the other part of the temple of Mecca are parks or places\r\n enclosed, where are seen two unicorns: they are shown to the people\r\n as a miracle; and not without good reason, for their rareness and\r\n strange nature. One of them, which is much higher than the other,\r\n is not much unlike a colt of thirty months of age: in the forehead\r\n groweth one horn, in manner right forth, of the length of three\r\n cubits. The other is only one year of age, and like a young colt:\r\n the horn of this is of the length of four handfuls. This beast is\r\n of that colour of a horse called weasel, and hath a head like a\r\n hart, but not a long neck, and a thin mane, hanging on one side.\r\n Their legs are thin and slender, like a fawn or hind: the hoofs of\r\n the fore feet are divided in two, much like the feet of a goat:\r\n the outer part of the hinder feet is very full of hair. This beast\r\n seemeth wild or fierce, yet tempereth that fierceness with a certain\r\n comeliness. These unicorns were given to the Sultan of Mecca as a\r\n most precious and rare gift. They were sent him out of Ethiopia by a\r\n king of that country, who was desirous by such a present to gratify\r\n the Sultan[83].”\r\n\r\nSo lately as the year 1799, a Mahomedan African prince is said to\r\nhave sent two of them to Mecca.—(REES’s _Cyclopedia_, “Monoceros.”)\r\nBell of Antermony describes one which was killed in Siberia, near\r\nthe _Irtish_, in 1713. Tamerlane slew unicorns and rhinoceroses on\r\nthe frontier of _Cashmere_, (_Sherefeddin_, b. 4., ch. xxx.) and\r\nthere have recently been _reports_ of unicorns in _Nepaul_, which are\r\nrendered more probable to be [p363] the truth, by those references\r\nof Mr. Bell and Sherefeddin to countries not very distant.\r\n\r\nThe British king Cuneboline had also the unicorn on his coins,\r\nand the figure of the animal is very similar to the above\r\ndescription[84]. The writer is, therefore, of opinion that these now\r\ndescribed are the real oryx mentioned by Aristotle, Pliny, and other\r\nancient authors[85].\r\n\r\n\r\n HIPPOPOTAMUS.\r\n\r\nThe remains of this beast have been found in England at the\r\nresidences of the Romans, _viz._, near London, Colchester, and York;\r\nand not any in Ireland or Scotland. They have also been found in\r\nItaly mixed with great numbers of the bones of other beasts known\r\nto have been exhibited by the Romans. This animal is not known to\r\ninhabit any country but Africa. Two were caught near Damietta, A.D.\r\n1600. They are known to inhabit Abyssinia, Bornou, the Cape of Good\r\nHope, Senegal, and they were met with in great abundance by the two\r\nvessels, the Sion, of 200 tons, and St. John, of 50 tons, which\r\nsailed above nine hundred miles up the river Gambia, A.D. 1620,\r\nemployed by Sir Wm. St. John[86]. The inference is, that they inhabit\r\nthe whole of that vast continent, and that it is most probable the\r\nnumber of species is as great as that of elephants; and that the\r\nfossil kinds not having been brought from the same country as the\r\nliving individuals with which they have been compared, has induced\r\nnaturalists to suppose them extinct. An elaborately grand Roman\r\n[p364] pavement was dug up at Roxby, in Lincolnshire, upon which\r\nis represented Orpheus, surrounded by an elephant, lion, boar, dog,\r\nwolf, stag, and another, which appears to be the hippopotamus[87].\r\n\r\n\r\n TURTLE.  TORTOISE.\r\n\r\n “A beautiful fossil sea-turtle has recently been discovered, and,\r\n by the perfect substitution of all the organic parts as well as its\r\n locality, may be considered an interesting remain of a former world.\r\n It is encrusted in a mass of ferruginous limestone, and weighs 180\r\n lbs. The spot on which it was found is in four fathoms of water,\r\n and is formed of an extensive stratum of stones, called the Stone\r\n Ridge, about four miles off Harwich harbour; and is considered to be\r\n the line of conjunction between the opposite cliffs of Walton and\r\n Harwich. It is in the possession of Mr. Deck, of Cambridge[88].”\r\n\r\nA fossil turtle was found near Harwich, embedded in a solid block of\r\ncement-stone; another large stone, when broken, was found to contain\r\n“nearly the whole of a _human_ skeleton[89].”\r\n\r\nFossil sea-tortoises have been found in the environs of Brussels, in\r\nthe environs of Maestricht, at the village of Melsbroeck and in the\r\nmountain of St. Peter, in the state of Glaris and in the vicinity of\r\nAix; they differ in species from any of those at present known[90].\r\n\r\nThere is not any of the extraneous fossil remains more probably of\r\nRoman origin than tortoises. “The beds, the doors, and pillars of the\r\nhouses of the Greeks and Romans, were decorated with tortoise-shell.\r\nIn the reign of Augustus, this species of luxury was at, its height\r\nin Rome[91]. Bruce says, the Egyptians dealt very largely with the\r\nRomans in this elegant article of commerce; Martial relates that\r\nbeds were inlaid with it; Velleius Paterculus observes, that when\r\nAlexandria was taken by Julius Cæsar, the magazines were so full of\r\nthis article, that he at first proposed to make it the principal\r\nornament of his triumph; as he used ivory afterwards when triumphing\r\nfor his African victories[92].” [p365]\r\n\r\nCuneboline and his son Arviragus having had the elephant, tapir, and\r\nunicorn on their coins; and as the first was brought up at the court\r\nof Augustus[93], there is every probability of their having possessed\r\ntortoises at Harwich, the port of the capital of the British king.\r\n\r\n\r\n SPECIES.\r\n\r\nWith regard to elephants, the number of species appears to be very\r\ngreat, even with the extremely limited knowledge we possess. The\r\nwriter saw three distinct kinds captured in one keddah at Tippera,\r\nwhen he was there during Mr. Corse’s residence at that place, and who\r\nhas described them. Some African females have tusks as large as the\r\nmales, but it is not known to be so in Asia. Le Vaillant mentions a\r\nrace of elephants which never have tusks. Two Ceylon elephants were\r\nfound to differ in the shape of the jaws, and another is mentioned by\r\nBaron Cuvier, which is dissimilar to any that had been seen[94].\r\n\r\nThe Camelopard now at Paris differs in many essential anatomical\r\ncharacters from the kind at the Cape of Good Hope[95].\r\n\r\nThe Romans and Moguls crossed the species and genera of different\r\nanimals. The crocotta was between a dog and a wolf; the crocuta,\r\nbetween a hyæna and a lioness[96]. The Moguls cross the breed of dogs\r\nwith leopards, the best of which are those of Hezereh and Tesheen in\r\nCabulistan; and some are so brave that they will attack a lion[97].\r\nFour towns near Babylon were exempted from any other tax than the\r\nmaintaining of dogs which were supposed to be produced between the\r\ntiger and bitch[98]. We thus may perceive how impossible it is to\r\nbe certain of a fossil species being extinct because we are not\r\nacquainted with it. [p366]\r\n\r\nPtolemy Philadelphus, in a procession at Alexandria, had twenty-four\r\nthousand Indian dogs, a camelopard, a white bear, and twenty-four\r\nchariots drawn by elephants, twelve by lions, seven by oryxes,\r\neight by ostriches, four by wild asses, and five by buffaloes[99].\r\nBajazet, in the fourteenth century, had twelve thousand dog-keepers.\r\nThe immensity of wild beasts slaughtered by the Persians, Moguls,\r\nand Romans, would be incredible, were it not attested by so many\r\ndifferent authorities; and with regard to the Romans, no author\r\nmentions a less number than five thousand of every description slain\r\nat the opening of the Coliseum. These sports having been in vogue all\r\nover the Roman empire for so many centuries, the fossil bones which\r\nhave been found are but few indeed. In Britain there were at least\r\nfive amphitheatres; at Sandwich, Dorchester, Silchester, Caerleon,\r\nYork[100]. In France, at Paris, Cahors[101], Vienne, Arles, Orange,\r\nAutun, Treves, Nismes, Poitou[102], and Bordeaux. In Spain, at\r\nSeville, Tarragona, Merida, and Saguntum. In Italy a great number.\r\nThe popularity of monarchs and statesmen depended on their power\r\nto indulge the people with these cruel sports. Commodus is said to\r\nhave been one of the most dexterous marksmen: he always had with\r\nhim Parthians, to teach him archery, and Moors, to perfect him in\r\nthrowing the dart. He ran with all horned animals, except bulls,\r\nand smote them unerringly as he pursued. Lions, panthers, and other\r\nfierce beasts, he ran after in the Peridrome, and darted at them from\r\nabove with never-failing effect, whether he aimed at the forehead or\r\nthe heart. With arrows, pointed like a half-moon, he would cut off\r\nthe heads of the Mauritanian ostriches, while their wings were [p367]\r\nexpanded to aid their speed, and they continued their course for\r\na time without their heads. He would expose a prize-fighter to the\r\nattack of a panther, and strike the beast dead before it could fasten\r\nits teeth on the man. A hundred lions have been sent out of the\r\ndens, and all killed by him with such certainty, that they lay close\r\ntogether, not a dart failing[103].\r\n\r\nDomitian had been equally notorious in these grand sports in the\r\nAmphitheatre.\r\n\r\n “What scene sequestered, or what rude renown,\r\n  Sends no spectator to the imperial town?\r\n  The Rhodopean hind now tempts the plains,\r\n  And tunes from Hemus his Orphean strains.\r\n  The Sarmat, Cæsar, hies, thy works to see;\r\n  And gives the steed he swills[104] to share the glee.\r\n  They come, who first the rising Nile explore;\r\n  And they who hear remotest ocean roar.\r\n  The Arab hasted, the Sabean flew;\r\n  And the Cilician own’d his native dew.\r\n  With tortured tresses, here Sicambrians gay;\r\n  There Ethiops, bristling in their diverse way.\r\n  ’Mid various speech, but one glad voice we find,\r\n  That hails thee father of converg’d mankind[105].”\r\n\r\nAs for the Romans themselves, according to Juvenal, these amusements\r\nseem to have been preferred to all others.\r\n\r\n “Could you the pleasures of the Cirque forego,\r\n  At Fabrateria or at Frusino,\r\n  Some villa might be bought, for what will here\r\n  Scarce hire a gloomy dungeon by the year[106].”\r\n\r\nHad the fossil animals died, or been killed by natural accidents, the\r\nskeletons would generally have been found entire, but for the most\r\npart they are scattered and broken, and are often mixed with bones\r\nof animals resembling the species of the present time[107]. In the\r\nvicinity of Orleans in France, a _fossil_ roe, of a living species,\r\nwas found in _limestone_, along with the bones of the _palæotherium_.\r\n\r\nInstances have occurred of bones being found, in great numbers; and,\r\nmany feet deeper, other heaps of bones of elephants and wild beasts;\r\nbut as many amphitheatres were built [p368] with wood, and as the\r\ngames were exhibited for about six centuries, those structures would\r\nrequire to be often renewed, and the old bones would thus be covered\r\nover with earth. Britain was invaded or visited by about twenty\r\nemperors, or those so high in importance as to become emperors of\r\nRome; and York was the head-quarters of the Roman empire during the\r\nresidence in Britain of Severus and his two sons and co-emperors,\r\nGeta and Caracalla[108]. All the _collections_ of fossil bones\r\nare found at the head-quarters of the Romans, or near the several\r\namphitheatres in the island. Bones of elephants which have been found\r\nin France and Italy in fifteen places, are so faithfully accurate to\r\nthe road over which Hannibal and Asdrubal with fifty-two elephants\r\nmarched[109], and _Hannibal’s (thirty-seven) all perished before\r\nhis arrival at Thrasymene_, that no theory whatever can stand in\r\ncompetition with such historical conviction[110]. If the bones found\r\non Hannibal’s road be not those of his Getulian elephants, are we\r\nto conclude that the remains of the beasts lost two thousand years\r\nago have totally perished; but that other bones of elephants, many\r\nthousands of years older, have been preserved upon the same spot,\r\nalthough some of them are found quite near the surface? At Plaine\r\nde Grenelle, a fossil elephant was dug up, and at that place there\r\nstood a Roman amphitheatre[111]. The great numbers of elephants then\r\nused in warfare may be judged of, by Metellus having captured upwards\r\nof a hundred in the battle of Palermo, where many besides had been\r\nkilled[112]; and accordingly fossil bones have been found, there\r\nand also at Syracuse, where there was an amphitheatre. In Spain,\r\nthirty-nine elephants were slain at Munda, in the battle fought\r\nbetween the two Scipios and Asdrubal. At the bridge of Manzanares,\r\nand at Toledo, fossil remains of elephants have been [p369] dug up;\r\nand at these very places Hannibal and Asdrubal defeated one hundred\r\nthousand Carpetani, many of whom were trodden to death by their forty\r\nelephants[113].\r\n\r\nIf we glance at the sports of the Mongols, what a treasure for an\r\nosteologist might be found at Termed in Sogdiana, where the army\r\ncommanded in person by Genghis Khan were four months occupied in\r\nenclosing an immense circle, till all the wild beasts were driven\r\n(without one escaping, under pain of death to the soldier who failed\r\nin his duty, but who was not allowed to kill the tigers, lions, &c.)\r\ninto a spacious plain, where they were slaughtered by the Grand Khan\r\nand all the Imperial princes and military commanders, till they\r\nchose to permit the soldiers to end the destruction[114]. How many\r\nfossil _species_ might be discovered there, of which naturalists\r\nhave no knowledge! The Persians are said to have slaughtered as many\r\nas fourteen thousand beasts on a like expedition[115]. So long have\r\nthese amusements existed, that Hushing, king of Persia, B. C. 865,\r\n_bred dogs and leopards_ for hunting[116].\r\n\r\nBesides the fossil remains which have been found of numerous\r\nquadrupeds, named by the Romans in their sports, they employed the\r\nfollowing, bones of which have not been detected:—Indian dogs, white\r\nbears, camels (one found), dromedaries, camelopards, wild asses,\r\nzebras, quaggas, oryxes (unicorns), Ethiopian sheep, Arabian sheep,\r\nthe crocotta (bred from a dog and wolf), crocuta (from a hyæna and\r\nlioness), little dragons, ostriches. The gnu was known to the Romans;\r\nand probably the nyl-ghau and the om-kergay (quite harmless, and\r\nthe size of a rhinoceros). In this list several of the fossil kinds\r\ndescribed as the ancient wild beast with a thick skin (palæotherium),\r\nand the beast without weapons, or unarmed (anoplotherium), may\r\nbe found, and also those of the genus canis, and a carnivorous\r\nbeast[117].\r\n\r\nSuch is a short notice of this most extensive subject, to which the\r\nwriter’s attention has been attracted by the concurrence of [p370]\r\nhistorical relations with the locality of fossil remains. It is\r\noffered for the consideration of the reader, not in a spirit of\r\ncontroversy, but with a desire to ascertain an important truth in\r\nnatural history, whether his speculations be confirmed or refuted.\r\nWhichever way a decision is awarded, it will add to the interest\r\nattached to zoological pursuits, and the reader will be, by these\r\nremarks, enabled to form a judgment whether the laborious and\r\ningenious works which have been published, since the conviction that\r\nelephants are not human giants, (a notion seriously maintained so\r\nrecently as in Clavegero’s _History of Mexico_, written since that of\r\nRobertson) are descriptions of the quadrupeds of a _former world_, or\r\nof the world which is now in _existence_. _It is necessary to remark\r\nthat these particular researches relate only to animals connected\r\nwith Roman and Mogul history_; and if it should be conceded that it\r\nmay justly be inferred, that quadrupeds hitherto deemed extinct are\r\nstill to be found in the undiscovered parts of Africa, Asia, and\r\nAmerica, not half of either region being yet scientifically known,\r\nit will give an interest to zoology and osteology ten fold more\r\nattractive than a blank and unsatisfactory hypothesis of their having\r\nall perished _before the creation of man_, as is often alleged. It\r\nis perhaps the most remarkable circumstance in literature, that\r\nnaturalists so rarely allude to the astonishing number of beasts\r\nslain in the Roman games, although the list of them is, generally\r\nspeaking, so similar to that of the fossil remains. Erroneous notions\r\nconcerning fossil bones, those of elephants, in particular, being the\r\nmost plentiful, began in very early ages when they were considered\r\nto be human; and James the First (of Britain) sent Lord Herbert\r\nof Cherbury to Gloucester, to ascertain if a skeleton, dug up at\r\nthat place, was really that of a giant. There were found mingled\r\nwith it horns and bones of oxen and sheep, and the tusks of a boar.\r\nLord Herbert, Dr. Clayton, and the celebrated Harvey, thought the\r\nbones were those of one of the Roman elephants; and Bishop Hakewill\r\nreceived a letter from my lord of Gloucester, mentioning that “he was\r\n_not confident_ that the grinder was the tooth of a man[118].” This\r\ndiscovery, perhaps, put an end in England to the notion of giants’\r\nbones. [p371]\r\n\r\nThe next fanciful origin was, that these fossil remains were those\r\nof an extinct monster, called Mammoth by the native Siberians, their\r\nname for the walrus; but which was transferred and confounded with\r\nthe bones of whales, elephants, and buffalos, found in that country,\r\nand such erroneous opinions will long be entertained in those\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe diluvian origin was imagined by many to be the true one, but\r\nlater careful examinations proving that the animals died on the spot\r\nwhere they are found broken, and the bones scattered about, that\r\nhypothesis could not in such instances be maintained, and recourse\r\nwas had to the supposition, that Britain was in former ages a\r\ntropical country; but the mixed fossil remains, being those both of\r\nhot and cold climates, and of beasts peculiar only to Africa, or to\r\nAsia, this theory appears to be quite as objectionable as the others.\r\nThe last, and the most specious, of all the hypothetical proofs of\r\nthe origin is, that the teeth not often corresponding with those of\r\nthe living specimens which have been seen, they must be the remains\r\nof extinct quadrupeds. There are, perhaps, fifty large regions\r\nwhere elephants abound, and the teeth of _very few indeed_ of the\r\nanimals of those countries have yet been seen. This last appears to\r\nbe, defective as it is, the strongest objection that can be urged\r\nagainst the historical origin; and the few remarks in this essay will\r\ncontribute materially to weaken this remaining hypothesis. The reader\r\nwho feels any interest in zoology will, by their means, be assisted\r\nin his endeavours to untie or cut this gordian knot. After he has\r\ndecided either that these beasts are in existence, or all extinct.\r\n\r\n “In his reflections, then, what scenes shall strike!\r\n  Adventures thicken! novelties surprise!\r\n  What webs of wonder shall unravel there[119]!”\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [53] Count Bournon; Phil.

The most eminent naturalists have been wrong\r\n in some of their conjectures. John Hunter pronounced the mastodon\r\n to be a carnivorous beast. Buffon, after frequently considering the\r\n bones of the mammoth, conceived them to belong to a beast six times\r\n larger than the biggest elephant; and Muller was of opinion that\r\n it must have been 105 feet in height, and 133 in length!

Night VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Description of a cheap and portable Instrument for enabling Young\r\n People to acquire a knowledge of the Stars, or determine their\r\n situation in the Heavens_. By S. Lee, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no science, the study of which tends so much to enlarge the\r\nmind as Astronomy. It opens to our view the grandest examples of\r\nAlmighty power, wisdom, and beneficence—the [p372] contemplation\r\nof which fills the soul with reverence and affection for the great\r\nAuthor of nature, and banishes all narrow and superstitious notions\r\nrespecting him.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this science, therefore, cannot be too strongly\r\nrecommended to the attention of young people. The eager curiosity\r\nand avidity for discovery which so peculiarly distinguish that\r\nperiod of life, when the reasoning faculties begin to develope, is\r\npeculiarly fitted for its reception—and, accordingly, amongst the\r\nbetter-educated classes of society, the elements of this science are\r\ngenerally considered as a necessary branch of instruction—though\r\ncommonly limited to a mere _dogmatic_ explanation of the Copernican\r\nsystem, and the use of the globes.\r\n\r\nBut this superficial mode of instruction, though sufficient to enable\r\nany one to understand the real motions of our planetary system, and\r\nexplain the apparent motions which must result from them, is hardly\r\nsufficient to satisfy inquisitive reasoning minds, since it leaves\r\nthem ignorant of the means by which the distances, magnitudes, and\r\norbits of the planets and comets were first discovered; and how, if\r\nlost, a knowledge of them might be recovered from observations alone.\r\n\r\nThe most pleasing methods of instruction will generally be found the\r\nmost efficient. It is impossible for any one who has had the least\r\nexperience in teaching not to have perceived, that one practical\r\napplication of science makes a deeper and more lasting impression on\r\nthe mind of a learner than a thousand theoretic propositions.\r\n\r\nAn accurate knowledge of the fixed stars is the first step to\r\npractical astronomy; it is, in fact, the alphabet of the science. By\r\nthe rising, southing, and setting of these bodies, astronomers are\r\nenabled correctly to measure time; and from their apparent altitudes,\r\nto determine the latitude of places on the surface of the globe,\r\nwhilst the permanent situations which they maintain with respect to\r\none another, furnish them with so many marks by which to trace the\r\ncourse of the sun, moon, and planets through the heavens. Such were\r\nthe data which enabled Copernicus and Newton to unravel the seeming\r\nirregularity of their apparent paths, and explain the beautiful\r\nsimplicity of their real motions.\r\n\r\nThe instruments usually had recourse to for this purpose [p373] are,\r\ncelestial globes, planispheres, and atlases, but none of these afford\r\nsuch ready and certain means of finding or identifying particular\r\nfixed stars, as at first might be expected from them.\r\n\r\nThe Globe possesses the great advantage of being easily rectified\r\nto the place of observation and adjusted to the exact hour of the\r\nnight. It likewise exhibits all the stars in their proper situations\r\nof altitude and azimuth;—but the constellations being delineated\r\non a convex surface, and viewed from without, whilst the heavens\r\nappear to us a concave viewed from within, the groups of stars are\r\nseen reversed, a circumstance which, occasions no small degree of\r\nperplexity to a learner.\r\n\r\nPlanispheres and atlases exhibit the constellations as they appear to\r\nthe eye when on the meridian, but in a position very different from\r\nthat which they assume when removed far from it. In short, except the\r\npleiades and a few remarkable groups, it is difficult to recognise a\r\nconstellation in every position, without great practice and continued\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe Equatorial furnishes the best and readiest means of discovering\r\nor identifying any particular star, but the great price of this\r\ninstrument, and the complicated nature of its adjustments, render it\r\nunfit for learners.\r\n\r\nThe instrument which we are about to describe, is in its principle\r\nthe same as the Equatorial, though not pretending to any thing like\r\nthe same degree of accuracy; but it has this advantage over it,—its\r\nadjustments are more simple and obvious, consequently, better adapted\r\nto the capacity of learners; and it can be afforded at a very\r\nmoderate expense, the price not exceeding that of a common globe.\r\n\r\nA, B, C, D, is the stand of the instrument, composed of three\r\ntriangular pieces of wood glewed together, so that the plane of the\r\nupper piece, D B C, makes with that of the lower piece, A B C, an\r\nangle equal to the co-latitude of the place it is intended for.\r\n\r\nOn the upper piece, D B C, is described a circle, E F G, the\r\ncircumference of which is divided into twenty-four hours, and every\r\nhour into twelve parts, equal to five minutes each.\r\n\r\nFrom the centre of this circle, and perpendicular to the [p374]\r\nplane on which it is described, rises a pillar, the top of which\r\nappears at H above the cone I, which can be made to revolve upon it\r\nas an axis.—On the surface of the cone is delineated the principal\r\nstars visible in England, and the lower edge is divided into 365\r\nparts, representing the days of the year.\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the top of the pillar is fitted a segment of a circle, K, of\r\n[p375] about 140°: viz. 90° of north, and 40° of south declination,\r\nwhich may be made to revolve upon the pillar as an axis independently\r\nof the cone. To this part is attached the scale, L, divided into\r\ndegrees of north and south declination, corresponding to those on the\r\nsemicircle,—and so contrived as in every situation to touch lightly\r\nthe surface of the cone.\r\n\r\nTo the declination circle K is attached the alidade M, which may be\r\nset to any degree required, and serves as an index to direct the eye\r\nof the observer to any object, which may be viewed along the edge of\r\nit, or through the small holes in the sights O P.\r\n\r\nHaving described the several parts of the instrument, it only remains\r\nto shew the use of it; which will be best explained by means of a few\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n PROBLEM 1. To adjust the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe instrument being made for the place of observation, need only\r\nto be placed on a perfectly horizontal stand, and with the line\r\njoining the hours XII and XII on the circle, in the direction of the\r\nmeridian: the former of these adjustments may be verified by means of\r\na small level applied to the stand at N, in the directions B C and A\r\nN successively. If found incorrect in either position, let a piece\r\nof card be put under that foot (A, B, or C) from which the bubble is\r\nfound to recede, and let this operation be repeated until the bubble\r\nrests in the middle, in both positions.\r\n\r\nThe instrument may be brought into the meridian by the assistance of\r\na magnetic needle fixed to the frame at N, or on the opposite side,\r\nor more correctly by means of the sun, provided the time be exactly\r\nknown, thus:—\r\n\r\nSet the index M to the sun’s declination, turn the circle K round\r\nits axis, till the scale L points to the hour and minute on the\r\ncircle E F G. Then if the instrument be correctly placed, the sun\r\nwill be seen through the sights O, P, or what is the same thing, the\r\nlight admitted at the hole O will fall on the hole P. If not, the\r\ninstrument must be turned about till this effect is produced.\r\n\r\nThe instrument being once carefully adjusted to the meridian on any\r\nimmoveable stand, such as the sill of a window, [p376] the top of\r\na post, &c., lines may be drawn on the stand in the direction of\r\nthe sides A B, A C, or B C, by means of which it may at any time be\r\nreplaced with little trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n PROBLEM 2. The instrument being correctly placed and levelled, the\r\n next operation will be to adjust the conical projection to the day\r\n and hour of observation.\r\n\r\nTurn the cone round till the day of the month on the circle, at the\r\nbottom of it, coincides with the hour and minute on the circle E F G.\r\n\r\nExample.—To adjust the cone for the 15th January, at twenty minutes\r\npast nine at night. Turn the cone till the 15th January on the circle\r\nattached to it coincides with IX h. 20 m. P. M. on the circle E F G.\r\n\r\n\r\n PROBLEM 3. The cone being adjusted, and any star proposed, to find\r\n its place in the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe cone remaining at rest, turn the declination segment K till\r\nthe scale L cuts the proposed star on the projection; note its\r\ndeclination on the scale and set the index M to the same degree on\r\nthe segment K, when the index will point to the star, which, if the\r\nadjustments have all been correctly made, will be seen through the\r\nsights P, O.\r\n\r\nExample.—To find the star Aldebaran; look for Aldebaran on the\r\nprojection, bring the scale L to cut it, and you will find it against\r\n16° north declination. Set index M to 16° N. P., and look along the\r\nedge of it, or through the holes P, O, and you will see the star.\r\n\r\n\r\n PROBLEM 4. Having observed a star in the heavens, to find it on the\r\n projection.\r\n\r\nSet the cone as accurately as you can to the day and hour, then turn\r\nthe declination segment round, and elevate the index till you can see\r\nthe star through the sights P, O. Note the declination at the segment\r\nK, cut by the index M, and against the corresponding degree of the\r\nscale you will find the star on the projection.\r\n\r\nIf no such star can be found, you may then conclude that it is a\r\nplanet, or a new star.\r\n\r\nBy this means the place of the moon, of a planet, or a comet, may be\r\nnoted down, from time to time, and their apparent paths traced out.\r\n[p377]\r\n\r\n\r\n PROBLEM 5. To find the hour of the day by the sun.\r\n\r\nTurn the segment K, and elevate the index M, till the sun is seen or\r\nshines through the sights O, P, and the scale L point to the hour and\r\nminute on the circle E F G.\r\n\r\n\r\n PROBLEM 6. To find the hour of the night by means of a star.\r\n\r\nDirect the index M to the star, so as to be seen through the sights\r\nP, O; then laying hold of the scale L, to keep it in that position,\r\nturn the cone till the star on the projection is cut by the scale,\r\nwhen the day of the month on the circle at the bottom of the cone\r\nwill coincide with the hour and minute on the circle E F G.\r\n\r\nThis instrument, though not capable of extreme accuracy, might, by\r\nmeans of careful workmanship, and the addition of a small telescope,\r\nbe made sufficiently so for finding stars in the day time; but such a\r\none as that now described will answer all the purposes of a learner,\r\nand enable very young people to acquire a correct and extensive\r\nknowledge of the stars in a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe surface of a cone has been adopted for the projection, in\r\npreference to that of a globe or planisphere, having been found,\r\nafter repeated trials, the figure best suited to the nature of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of Animals, compiled\r\n with constant reference to Physiology, and elucidated by twenty\r\n copper-plates_. By C. J. Carus, M.D., &c. Translated from the\r\n German, by R. T. Gore, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in\r\n London.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we except Sir Everard Home’s splendid work on comparative anatomy,\r\nwe have no original treatise on that subject which deserves notice;\r\nand even Sir Everard’s lectures must rather be considered as a series\r\nof essays on detached parts of that branch of science, than as a\r\nregular and systematic view of it. We have long been acquainted with\r\nthe work of Dr. Carus, and have always considered it as a laborious\r\nand accurate epitome of the principal facts and authorities in the\r\nstudy to which it relates. From the immense field of inquiry which it\r\nembraces, it is necessarily complicated, and [p378] in some places\r\na little obscure, but it is entirely free from those speculative\r\nand hypothetical wanderings which are too characteristic of the\r\nGerman school of physiology; and though it contains some systematic\r\nnotions in which we cannot acquiesce, and a few new words, not the\r\nmost harmonious in the world, it may very safely and properly be\r\nrecommended to the student as a text-book, and to the proficient as\r\na work of reference. The plates by which it is illustrated are upon\r\nan economical scale, sometimes rather too small to be distinct, but\r\nthey are otherwise accurate and carefully drawn; and we are aware\r\nthat it is impossible to obviate these objections without incurring\r\nsuch expense as would probably render the work inaccessible to those\r\nreaders for whom it is principally compiled.\r\n\r\nMr. Gore has assiduously and faithfully executed the difficult task\r\nof translation, and has added no inconsiderable quantity of new and\r\nimportant matter in the form of notes, rendering the English work\r\nmore complete, and upon many points much more satisfactory than the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Experiments to determine the Comparative Value of the principal\r\n varieties of Fuel used in the United States, and also in Europe,\r\n and on the ordinary Apparatus used for their Combustion_. By Marcus\r\n Bull. Philadelphia and London, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of London and its immediate environs may be estimated\r\nat about two millions, and the annual consumption of coals within the\r\nsame district does not fall far short of two millions of chaldrons,\r\nor seventy-two millions of bushels. Of this prodigious quantity of\r\ninflammable matter, a very considerable portion escapes combustion,\r\nand lodges in the form of soot in our chimneys, or is vomited forth\r\nto contaminate and cloud the atmosphere of the metropolis: so great\r\nis this loss, that independent of the mere advantage of getting rid\r\nof smoke, its prevention is an important economical problem; and\r\nthough the rage for smoke-burning has passed over, we are quite\r\ncertain that the subject still deserves the most serious attention,\r\nbeing convinced that, of the fuel consumed in the ordinary processes\r\nof warming our houses and cooking food, at least one-third is\r\nuselessly thrown away, and might be saved by a more economical and\r\nscientific construction of common grates and fire-places. All useful\r\nand well-conducted experiments, therefore, in [p379] relation to\r\nthese matters, deserve notice; and though much of Mr. Bull’s essay\r\nis not applicable to our case, it contains a variety of interesting\r\nfacts and information: his experiments appear to have been very\r\ncarefully conducted, and should be consulted by all those who are\r\nengaged in similar investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Meteorological Essays and Observations_.

Second Part, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope to be able in our next Number to enter into a detailed\r\nexamination of the subject of Mr. Daniell’s inquiries; at present,\r\ntherefore, our object is merely to announce the second edition of his\r\nvaluable and laborious essays, and the publication of the present\r\n_second part_, in which, for the convenience of those who possess\r\nthe former edition, all the new matter is collected. It includes the\r\nfollowing essays:—\r\n\r\n1.

By John\r\n Griffin, Author of Chemical Recreations. Glasgow, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerforming with the blowpipe is something like playing upon the\r\nfiddle—it looks mighty easy, but for its perfect accomplishment\r\nrequires a combination of skill and dexterity which practice alone\r\ncan confer. We are disposed, therefore, to think lightly of those\r\nessays upon the subject which pretend to instruct the beginner in\r\nthe actual use of the instrument; telling him how he is to puff out\r\nhis cheeks, breathe through his nose, make a valve of his tongue,\r\nand keep up a [p381] perpetual stream through the nozzle of the\r\ntube; all which is much easier described than done, and is entirely\r\nmatter of experimental acquisition, more easily attained without\r\nthan with the usual instructions. In the little work before us, all\r\nthese matters are passed over with fit brevity, and the attention of\r\nthe student is chiefly directed to the appearances which different\r\nsubstances exhibit before the blowpipe, and by which minerals may\r\nbe distinguished and classed. The history of these constitute the\r\nbulk of Mr. Griffin’s duodecimo, being preceded only by a few\r\nremarks upon the different kinds of blowpipe, respecting which we\r\nhave merely to observe that justice is not done to Mr. Newman, who\r\nfirst suggested what is here called “Dr. Clarke’s blowpipe;” indeed\r\nelsewhere the author seems a little angry with Mr. Children for\r\nrecommending Mr. Newman’s apparatus. We observe, moreover, that no\r\nnotice is taken of Mr. Newman’s and several other papers on the\r\nblowpipe, which have appeared in the old series of this Journal; nor\r\nof Dr. Clarke’s original Essay, published in the second volume of\r\nthat work, from which, and sundry other symptoms, we conclude that\r\nMr. Griffin is a pupil of Dr. Thomas Thomson. Be this as it may, we\r\nbear him no malice, and very conscientiously recommend his book to\r\nthe mineralogical student, as a valuable and clear epitome of what\r\nrelates to the behaviour of substances before the blowpipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Circle of the Seasons, and Perpetual Key to the Calendar and\r\n Almanack; to which is added the Circle of the Hours and History\r\n of the Days of the Week, being a compendious Illustration of the\r\n History, Antiquities, and Natural Phenomena of each Day in the\r\n Year_. London, 1828. Small 8vo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of this book may lead our readers to suspect it as an\r\ninterloper among works on science; but it touches upon many points of\r\nscientific inquiry, and upon botany especially, and is compiled with\r\nso much evident labour and accuracy, as to merit recommendation. The\r\nsaints and festivals of each day are recorded, by which we make the\r\nacquaintance of many worthy persons and curious anecdotes; there is\r\nalso a brief natural history of each day, containing short notices\r\nof the plants which on an average begin to flower or to fade, and\r\nof the birds which arrive or begin to sing. [p382] The merits of\r\nthe descriptive poetry, which is thickly interspersed, we leave to\r\nother critics. Those who are destined to live in the “fuliginous\r\ntenebrosity” of this smoke-saturated metropolis, and to breathe an\r\natmosphere “sated with exhalations rank and fell,” care little about\r\nthe first peeping forth of the modest snowdrop, or the early bursting\r\nof the golden crocus; but such as reside in the country will be\r\nglad to have their attention pleasingly directed to the successive\r\nproducts of the field, the flower-garden, and the green-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Conversations on the Animal Economy_. By a Physician. 2 vols. small\r\n 8vo. London, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have more than once expressed our opinion on the subject of\r\nconveying information to young people in the way of “Conversations,”\r\nwhich in the present volumes are carried on between Dr. A., Harriet,\r\nSophia, and Charles; they are at once instructive and amusing, and\r\nevidently the produce of one possessed of much information upon the\r\nsubjects discussed, and, what is more to the point, of the art of\r\npleasantly and intelligibly conveying it.\r\n\r\nThe Conversations open with an account of the coverings or\r\ninteguments of animals; their arrangements by systematic writers are\r\nthen adverted to, and a short but useful description is given of the\r\nvarieties of mankind, as enumerated by Blumenbach and illustrated\r\nby Camper. The bones and muscles form the subjects of the fifth\r\nand sixth conversations; they are concisely described, and with\r\nsufficient accuracy. The brain and nervous system and the organs of\r\nsense are next talked about. The doctrines of phrenology are fairly\r\nexplained; and in the conversations on smell and taste, vision,\r\nhearing, and touch, the anatomy of the respective organs, and their\r\nvarieties in the different animal tribes are treated of, the dulness\r\nof the details being relieved by physiological illustrations. The\r\nremaining conversations are occupied with an account of the principal\r\nfunctions of animals, and of the several organs chiefly concerned\r\nin their performance; the varieties of teeth and stomachs are here\r\ntreated of, and the structures of the heart and blood-vessels, as\r\nconcerned in circulation and respiration. The production of heat by\r\nanimal systems is then noticed; and the twentieth and concluding\r\nconversation is employed in the exposition of the general phenomena\r\nof growth and decay. [p383]\r\n\r\nWe have thus briefly stated the contents of these volumes, which\r\nare further illustrated by numerous woodcuts and several plates;\r\nand are perfectly ready to commend the performance as an extremely\r\nuseful and proper book for young persons, but _not_, in our opinion,\r\nof both sexes: we should have been better pleased if Harriet and\r\nSophy had been replaced by William and Thomas; for we cannot fancy\r\nthe subjects here discussed as quite fit for young ladies. Boys, on\r\nthe contrary, ought to know much more of these matters than they\r\ncommonly do; and for conveying such information in a pleasing and\r\nfamiliar, yet neither vulgar nor superficial style, this compilation\r\nseems perfectly appropriate, and will, we trust, find, as it ought, a\r\nnumerous class of readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Notice of a New Genus of Plants discovered in the Rocky Mountains\r\n of North America by_ Mr. David Douglas. By John Lindley, Esq.,\r\n F.L.S., &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon his journey across the rocky mountains in April 1827, in\r\nlatitude 52° N., longitude 118° W., at an estimated elevation of\r\n12,000 feet above the level of the sea, the attention of Mr. Douglas\r\nwas attracted by a brilliant purple patch amidst the surrounding\r\nsnow. On approaching it, he was surprised to find that the colour\r\nwhich had arrested his eye was caused by the blossoms of a little\r\nplant, from which the superincumbent snow had not yet melted away.\r\nThe well-known Saxifraga oppositifolia immediately occurred to his\r\nrecollection, and he at first imagined he had either discovered that\r\nspecies, or one nearly allied to it; but upon a closer inspection,\r\nhe perceived that it was no Saxifraga, but a genus apparently new.\r\nSpecimens having been submitted to me for examination since Mr.\r\nDouglas’s return, the following description has been drawn up:—\r\n\r\nThe plant forms a thick tuft consisting of numerous perennial\r\nbranched stems, the lower of which are covered with the persistent\r\ndecayed leaves and fruit of previous summers. The _stems_ are round,\r\nbright purplish brown, covered with scattered, rigid, branched,\r\nshort hairs, and densely clothed with opposite spreading leaves.\r\nThe leaves are a dull glaucous green, semi-amplexicaul, [p384]\r\nlinear, obtuse, about five lines long and three-quarters of a line\r\nbroad, so closely covered with hairs like those of the stem, that\r\nthe whole epidermis is hidden. Their veins are concealed by the\r\nhairs; but if the latter are removed, they appear to consist of a\r\nthickened mid-rib, and a few nearly simple spreading venæ primariæ.\r\nThe _flowers_ proceed from the axillæ of the upper leaves, from\r\nthree to six on each little branch; at first they are sessile, but\r\ntheir foot-stalks subsequently lengthen by degrees until the fruit\r\nis ripe, when they are from three-quarters of an inch to one inch in\r\nlength, and covered with the same sort of hairs as the leaves and\r\nstem. The _calyx_ is hairy in like manner, obconical, angular, with\r\nfive equal erect narrowly triangular teeth, about the length of the\r\ntube. The _corolla_ is of a vivid purple colour, infundibuliform,\r\nwholly destitute of pubescence; the _tube_ is a little ventricose\r\nand rather longer than the calyx, its whole length being about three\r\nlines; the _limb_ is spreading, five-parted with cuneate, oblong,\r\nobtuse, segments; the orifice is guarded by five transversely linear\r\ncalli, placed under each sinus, and corresponding to the same number\r\nof external depressions of the neck of the tube. The _anthers_ are\r\nlinear oblong, nearly sessile, opposite the segments of the corolla,\r\nand a little enclosed within the tube. The _ovarium_ is superior, of\r\nan obovate figure, one-celled, with a central, free, fungilliform\r\nplacenta, the lower edge of which has five teeth corresponding to an\r\nequal number of peltate ovula; the _style_ is filiform, as long as\r\nthe tube of the corolla, and continuous with the ovarium; _stigma_,\r\na minute depressed cup. The _capsule_ is of a cartilaginous texture,\r\nsurrounded by the persistent calyx; one-celled, with five recurving\r\nvalves; the _seeds_ are two, peltate, oblong, convex on the outside,\r\nconcave in the inside, dark brown, covered closely with minute\r\ndots or depressions; four only having been found, their internal\r\norganization has not been determined.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that, with the exception of the interior of the\r\nseed, the whole structure of the plant is determinable: it is also\r\nobvious that it is referable to Primulaceæ, of which it possesses\r\nall the characters. In fact it is closely akin both to Primula and\r\nAndrosace. From both these genera, however, [p385] its ovarium which\r\nexhibits the greatest instance of reduction of ovula yet known in the\r\norder, and its dispermous capsule, with oblong concave seeds, readily\r\nand essentially distinguish it.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, named it after its indefatigable discoverer,\r\nwhose active and successful researches in its native country, richly\r\nentitle him to the distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n DOUGLASIA.\r\n\r\n NAT.

A.\r\n Kendall, Esq., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening and right of the 25th of September last, the horizon\r\nof the metropolis, toward the north, and toward the north-west and\r\nthe north-east, exhibited a remarkable display of the meteor or\r\nphenomenon called, after the example of the Italian philosopher\r\nGassendi, Aurora Borealis.\r\n\r\nThe weather, for many days preceding, had been mild, with alternate\r\nsunshine, clouds, and showers. The wind had been generally in the\r\nwest and south-west quarters; though on the 18th and 19th it was in\r\nthe north-west, and on the 20th in the north-east. The barometer,\r\nat three o’clock in the afternoon, had stood at from 30° 40′ to 30°\r\n20′, to which latter height it had descended on the 20th; and, from\r\nthat day to the 25th, it had remained, at 29° 90′ and 29° 75′. The\r\nthermometer, at the same hour, between the 14th and the 20th, had\r\nranged between 65° 6′ and 59° 2′; and it stood, on the 25th, at 59°\r\n6′, with the wind in the south-west. The sky, toward the zenith, on\r\nthe evening of that day, was [p386] partially clear, and partially\r\ncovered with shifting clouds. On the north, and on the west and east\r\nof north, heavy and stationary clouds blackened the whole horizon, to\r\nan elevation of more than five degrees; and the southern hemisphere\r\nwas dark with dark clouds from the horizon to the zenith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI. By some, the Aurora was seen from the time when the sun was\r\nset; but the first appearance in the heavens, which attracted the\r\nattention of the present writer, whose situation at the moment shut\r\nout from him the horizon upon all sides but the west, was that of a\r\ncertain breadth of red or copper-coloured light, or of light of a\r\ncolour nearly resembling that reflected by an ordinary conflagration\r\nof buildings, pointing upward from the west. The colour, indeed,\r\nwas dissimilar from that which is usual upon the occurrence of a\r\nfire on a cloudy night; yet, in the absence of any other immediate\r\nexplanation, he should not have hesitated so to understand it,\r\nexcept for the figure within which it was circumscribed, and which,\r\ninstead of being diffusive, and less and less conspicuous toward\r\nits extremities, or rounded in its outline, like masses of ruddy\r\nsmoke, had the peculiarities of an equal breadth, rectilinear\r\nsides, a square top, and sharp outlines. Its height was continually\r\nincreasing; but not even that phenomenon, nor even the curve to the\r\neastward, across the heavens, and which it presently began to add to\r\nits figure, were appearances absolutely to dissipate the illusion of\r\nthe existence of a fire; and it was scarcely, therefore, till this\r\nbreadth of colour, throwing itself entirely over the heavens, and\r\ndescending, at its projected extremity, toward the east, formed an\r\narch, of which, perhaps, the elevation was seventy degrees, (which\r\nwas not the work of many minutes, the motion, at the same time, being\r\nvisible, but of moderate rapidity,) that its real character of a\r\nnatural phenomenon distinctly impressed itself upon the mind of the\r\npresent writer, its observer. While this, however, was proceeding,\r\nthe road which he was pursuing had brought him more into view of\r\nthe north-western and northern horizon; and, then, the light in the\r\nnorth, and to the west of north, which, from behind the clouds that\r\nlined the horizon, seemed like the light of a rising moon, or of\r\nthe [p387] breaking day, together with the vertical projection of\r\nrays of light, beneath and above the arch, removed every doubt as to\r\nthe cause of the appearance, by demonstrating its connexion with an\r\nAurora Borealis.\r\n\r\nIt was now about a quarter past eleven o’clock. The sky, beneath\r\nthe lower or inner edge of the arch, was clear and star-light, and,\r\nthrough the contrast created by the ruddy colour placed against\r\nit, appeared of a lively blue. The upper edge of the arch, in the\r\nmeantime, was relieved only by the dark gray of the clouds, which,\r\nwith more or less continuity, overhung the upper part of the heavens.\r\nBut these latter were now dispersing; the cloudless zenith, which\r\npresently afterwards disclosed itself, was now progressively and\r\nswiftly preparing; and, as the clouds moved and fled, the outlines of\r\nthe arch lost their sharpness, the colour changed, from that of fire\r\nor of copper, to something more or less of purple or of the rose; it\r\nspread itself in the vapour, and with the vapour vanished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nII. But this was only the curtain of the stage, behind the folds of\r\nwhich the true scene had its existence. This latter, still concealed,\r\nto a certain and uniform height, by a parapet, as it were, of dark\r\nand unbroken clouds, consisted, first, in the ground of white light,\r\nalready described as resembling that of a sky in the midst of which\r\nclouds shut out the disk of the moon, or rather that in which the\r\nrising sun is just about to appear; and, secondly, in a range of\r\ncolumns, or fountains, or jets of light, more coloured than the\r\nground, which, rising from behind the ridge or parapet of clouds, and\r\nfrom and in the midst of the white light, formed, together, not the\r\nfigure which would have been produced by their uniform convergence\r\ntoward the zenith, but one which bore some resemblance to that\r\nassumed by the sticks of a fan, or still more to the appearance\r\nof stalks in a flower-basket, or in a sheaf of corn. For, in this\r\nmanner, the column, which, in general terms, may be called the\r\ncentral one, and which arose in the due north, was vertical, and\r\ntherefore projected toward the zenith; while those which extended\r\nfrom it upon either side, that is, toward the west or toward the\r\neast, gradually inclined more and more [p388] toward the horizon on\r\ntheir respective sides; and, as to the outer columns on the east,\r\ninclined, not in rectilinear figures, but in curves more or less\r\ndecided. In these columns or coruscations several particulars were to\r\nbe remarked.\r\n\r\n1. That, within the space of from one hour to two, the whole group\r\nappeared to traverse the horizon together, from the west of north to\r\nthe east of north, as if upon one movable base, or as if the source\r\nof their appearance became gradually exhausted to the west of north,\r\nand grew gradually into activity upon the east of north; alternatives\r\nof explanation, however, which might materially affect the theory of\r\ntheir production. During the whole change, in the meantime, the north\r\npreserved its splendour, appearing uniformly as the focus of the\r\nfire, or as the pivot of the machine, or as the well from which all\r\nelse was supplied. The change consisted in the appearance of columns,\r\nof more or less magnitude, strength, and brightness, more or less\r\nadvanced from the north toward the west, or from the north toward the\r\neast; but the north, during all this variation, suffered no other\r\nchange than this, that whereas, in the beginning of the evening, the\r\ngreater portion of columns rose to its west, while, in the latter\r\npart of the night, the greater portion arose to its east. But,\r\nbesides this general configuration, and this united motion of the\r\nmeteor, there was to be observed, in the several columns themselves,\r\nboth the variations of colour which distinguished one from another,\r\nand the irregular and independent movement of each, always in the\r\ndirection of its length or altitude, and situate in the interior,\r\nas it were, of its body; and also that peculiarity of form which\r\ndistinguishes these coruscations from all other luminous appearances.\r\n\r\n2. The colours of the columns, in that part of their height which\r\nis nearest their base, and where, as a ground, they had only the\r\nwhite light of the horizon, by which, and by their motion, and it\r\nshould, perhaps, be added, their vividness, they were distinguished,\r\nis a point upon which the writer speaks with some hesitation, and\r\nwith respect to the more close observation of which he could like\r\nto enjoy a second opportunity of beholding the phenomenon. The\r\nvariety and richness, and sometimes the terrible grandeur, of the\r\ncolours [p389] exhibited in the Aurora Borealis, is the constant\r\ntheme of spectators and naturalists; and, upon the late occasion,\r\nan observer, apparently of more regularly scientific habits of\r\npursuit than himself[120], has particularly insisted upon a column,\r\nof a violet colour, rising west of north, and the place of which he\r\nthinks corresponding with that of the _magnetic pole_; a coincidence\r\nfrom which, as it may seem, he would believe a confirmation of the\r\n_magnetic theory_ of the production of the Aurora to be obtained.\r\nIn setting down the present description, the writer tasks himself\r\nto the most faithful description of what he actually saw, and\r\nsuppression of all desire to support or condemn a theory, of which\r\nhis mind is capable; and by those rules, therefore, the whole\r\nstatement will be guided. His description already differs from that\r\nof some of his fellow-witnesses, as will be expressly considered\r\nbelow; but he confesses that while, in point of persuasion, he much\r\ninclines to the idea, that all the light displayed by the Aurora is\r\nin itself white, and only tinctured to the eye of the spectator by\r\nthe atmospherical medium through which it is seen; and while, with\r\nrespect to all those deeper colours, whether crimson or purple, or\r\nblood-colour, which appal the superstitious, and are described by the\r\npicturesque narrator as exhibiting the terrible in matters of vision,\r\nhe judges it supposable that the whole machinery consists in the same\r\ninterposition of vapour, near the horizon, which so often gives to\r\nthe sun and moon themselves the appearance of being coloured like\r\nblood: while, therefore, he still adheres to his opinion, that the\r\ncolours ascribed to the Aurora are wholly extrinsic; and, to borrow\r\nthe words of a scientific writer, “dependent upon the medium through\r\nwhich they are seen;” he is obliged to acknowledge, that it did\r\nappear to him, that the several columns, in truth, were yet variously\r\ncoloured, of pale, but bright and pleasing colours, from a pale\r\nyellow to a pale pink and a pale violet, and this in the direction\r\nof their height or length,—a phenomenon which wholly excludes, as\r\nto those columns and their colours, the influence of an interposing\r\nmedium, the effect of which would be perceived horizontally, and\r\nacross the whole range of columns, or part of the range, and not\r\n[p390] vertically nor obliquely, according to the direction of each\r\ncolumn, and within the limits of its sides. He confesses, also, that\r\nhe did take notice of the pale, but bright violet-coloured column,\r\ndistinguished also by its breadth and height, and situated to the\r\nwest of north; but which column, he is surely right in adding,\r\nultimately moved, with those next to it, toward the north. He\r\ndistinctly and pointedly observed, at the same time, that the columns\r\nwhich stood due north were always white, and that the colours of\r\nthe other columns appeared to strengthen in proportion as they were\r\ndistant from the due north, either west or east; and he came to a\r\nfixed conclusion, while the phenomenon was under his eye, that, to\r\nhis judgment at least, the strength of the fire, so to say, was in\r\nthat point of the horizon which lay due north; and that there was a\r\ndiminished brightness, with a proportionable increase of colour, to\r\nthe right and left.\r\n\r\n3. As to the separate movements of the columns, these, in the first\r\nplace, were quick, and forced upon the eye, while the movement which\r\ngradually deployed or advanced the right wing of the celestial\r\narm, and gradually contracted or withdrew the left, was slow, and\r\nperceived only by its results; and, in the second place, while these\r\nlatter were parallel to the horizon, the former were either vertical,\r\nor in the oblique or curved direction of the bodies of the columns.\r\nBut this motion consisted either in vibration, or in irregular but\r\nalternate projections and contractions; and the motion of each\r\ncolumn, as has been said, was independent on that of others. Rarely,\r\ntwo adjoining columns were in motion at the same time. Almost always\r\nthe moving column or columns were seen to start from the midst of\r\nothers, which, for the time, were quiescent, but which had had their\r\nturn before, and would presently have it again. What eminently struck\r\nthe writer, however, was the internal motion of that to which he\r\ncannot allow himself to give another name than that of the apparent\r\nluminous material of the columns. It seemed to him as if the volume\r\nof each column or coruscation was itself composed of parallel lines\r\nof luminous matter, arranged in the direction of the column, and\r\nevery one of which was separately the subject of movements similar\r\nto those of the entire [p391] column, or entire bundle of lines; or\r\nas if the whole column were like the stalk of a plant, and filled\r\nwith upright and luminous fibres, or like a skein of thread, drawn\r\nvertically or obliquely, and of which each particular thread should\r\nhave particular motion in the direction of the whole; or (what he\r\nthought the comparison which proclaimed the very nature of the\r\nmaterial of the columns) like fountains, or jets of water in the sun,\r\nin which every particular particle should be moving in the general\r\ndirection of the jet, and yet each moving and shining for itself.\r\n\r\n4. And this apparent nature of the substance of the columns or\r\ncoruscations allies itself to what finally regards them; namely,\r\ntheir form. In this description, they have hitherto been spoken of by\r\nthe name of columns or pillars; and the similitude, which that name\r\nsuggests, is justified by the general figure of all the lower parts\r\nof their bodies, which, unlike the figure of rays of light on the one\r\nhand, and unlike that of flames of fire on the other, is a tall or\r\nlengthened object, of small comparative diameter or breadth, and of\r\nwhich the sides consist in right and nearly parallel lines. But, by\r\nthe English, these columns, pillars, or coruscations, were anciently\r\ncalled so many _burning spears_; and they have also received the\r\nnames of _streamers_ and _pencills_[121], which two latter, in the\r\nhistory of appurtenants of war, signify long and narrow, and pointed\r\nbanners or flags. Their similitude to flags is excusably fancied from\r\ntheir quick, capricious, and irregular motions, but their likening to\r\n“spears,” is that which may claim to be thought the most felicitous,\r\nas to the true conception of their form, as it is also that, the idea\r\nof which contributes to render the phenomenon the most fearful in the\r\n[p392] survey of ignorance and superstition. But the SPEAR-SHAPE\r\nis descriptive, because the coruscations, unlike rays of light, and\r\nunlike flames of fire, have neither the obtuse figure of a pyramid,\r\nnor the acute one of an obelisk, upright or reversed; but, after\r\nrising, through almost their whole height or length, of an equal or\r\nnearly equal diameter, terminate in a point which is formed, not of\r\nright lines, like the point of a dagger, but of curved lines, so as\r\nto form the rounded point of a spear, or that figure which is so\r\nfamiliar to botanists, as spoken of “spear-shaped” leaves. A ray of\r\nlight, in whatever direction it is thrown, broadens, with right-lined\r\nsides, from the first point of its departure, to the furthest stretch\r\nof its projection; a flame of fire points uniformly upward, with the\r\nsame regularity of form, excepting only as it is liable to undulation\r\nfrom the motion of the atmosphere; but, the columns, spears,\r\nstreamers, or coruscations of the Aurora Borealis, have no form but\r\nthat under review.\r\n\r\n5. About half-past eleven o’clock, or nearer to twelve, several\r\npowerful columns shot toward the zenith; while, to the east of north,\r\nothers were at once curved in their form, and projected in an angle\r\nof about thirty degrees with the horizon. But while, upon the west\r\nof north, the sky, above the ridge of clouds, was entirely clear, so\r\nthat, there, the columns played upon a ground which formed a slight\r\ncontrast with themselves, here, the clouds were still heavy, and\r\nthe columns behind them appeared, in consequence, of a fiery red,\r\ndeepening as they approached the outer edge of the whole display, at\r\nwhich was the sharpest outline, contrasted in the distinctest manner\r\nwith the dark sky. The light upon that side called to the mind of\r\nthe writer the “dunnest smoke of hell,” of Macbeth; while, as to its\r\nouter line, as seen from the east end of Pall-mall, the sides of the\r\nstone spire of St. Martin’s church, which rose to the eastward of\r\nit in the sky, were not more sharply defined; the dark intervening\r\nsky affording relief to both, though not equally so, upon account of\r\nthe superior brightness of even the obscured columns. But, in taking\r\nleave of this columnar, or spear-like, and main part of the Aurora,\r\nit may be permitted to add, that, in those tapering forms, together\r\nwith their motions, (though the comparison [p393] may still be\r\nsufficiently remote and fanciful,) it was easy to discern the origin\r\nof their having been resembled to weapons of war; that is, to the\r\nspears of an army, raised, lowered, laid at angles, and gleaming,\r\nglittering, crossing, and clashing in battle. And equally, too,\r\nfrom their quick, varied, and separate, and, as it were, whimsical\r\nmotions, might they reasonably receive, in their milder displays,\r\nand in moments of more peaceful and cheerful association, the very\r\ndifferent name of _merry dancers_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII. Though, as will presently be found, it is the ruling idea of\r\nthe present writer, that the Aurora Borealis is a single object,\r\nits appearance, when unmodified by the accompaniments of clouds or\r\nfogs, being merely that of its own coruscations, playing in the\r\nfree expanse, yet for the purposes of analytical description and\r\ncontemplation, it is here thought convenient to divide it into\r\nthe three parts in which, through the temporary and accidental\r\nintervention of the coloured arch before-mentioned, it appeared in\r\nthe night now in recollection. These three supposititious parts,\r\nthen, may be understood as follows: first, the arch, belt, or band\r\nwhich was temporarily thrown across the heavens; second, the main\r\nbody of the coruscations below the arch; and third, the coruscations\r\nabove it, and in or near the zenith. It is of these only that it\r\nremains to speak.\r\n\r\nIt was not till about midnight that the zenith itself (which,\r\nhowever, formed the southern boundary to this part of the display)\r\nbecame the scene of a class of appearances, differing, indeed,\r\nessentially, in their forms, from those in the horizon, but closely\r\nconnected, as it may be believed, with all the materials, and all the\r\nmovements, of these latter. The zenith, at that hour, was cloudless,\r\nand resplendent with stars, and the air was freshened by a gentle\r\nbreeze from the south. Between the earth and the stars above, there\r\nwas no apparent intervening vapour, and nothing, therefore, save\r\nthat atmospherical fluid which eludes the sight. But, through that\r\nmedium, if such only it was, coruscations were now continually\r\nshooting, of which the appearance was, that it overspread this\r\nportion of the vault of heaven with an ever-shaken [p394] sheet\r\nof thin, gauzy, white, or yellowish-white, and nebulous, or cloudy\r\nmatter. To the writer, this superior portion of the Aurora, though\r\nnot the most lustrous, and, therefore, not the most striking of the\r\nwhole, was yet by no means the least interesting and inviting to\r\nattention; for, here, as its appeared to him, the _material_ and the\r\nmanner of operation of the meteor were brought nearer to the eye,\r\nand exhibited with such a back-ground (the starry heavens) as gave a\r\ntransparent view of the same matter as that, which, (as he thought,)\r\nseen vertically, and in the horizon, appeared comparatively, at\r\nleast, opaque. The transparent medium, however, above, through which,\r\neven when shook or vibrating, and even when whitened with light,\r\nthe stars were always seen in more or less brightness, was now in\r\ncontinual motion; or, meteoric light or matter was continually,\r\nthough irregularly, and as it were, playfully shot through it. The\r\nilluminated substance (whether the atmospherical fluid, reflecting\r\nthe light of the meteor, or the luminous body of the meteor itself,\r\nbut probably the latter) was incessantly discovering itself in\r\ndifferent places; now here, now there, now bright, now dim; but far\r\nless in a manner, or with an appearance, such to be compared with\r\nlightning, than with such as resembled the changes of ripple upon the\r\nbosom of a wide-spread water, when a variable breeze blows over it;\r\nfirst in one part, and then in another; and now in one direction,\r\nand the next moment in a second. Or, the canopy of heaven, at this\r\ntime, might be said to be composed of a lace or gauze bearing a\r\nfigured pattern, of which the fluttering motion continually changed\r\nthe places, or hid or re-displayed the figures represented; or the\r\npicture, perhaps, will be more easily imagined, if conveyed in the\r\nvery appropriate language of an older hand, which, referring to\r\nthe appearances displayed in the zenith, remarks, “They break out\r\nin places where none were seen before, skimming briskly along the\r\nheavens; are suddenly extinguished, and leave behind a uniform dusky\r\ntrack. This, again, is brilliantly illuminated in the same manner,\r\nand as suddenly left a dull blank.” It should be understood, however,\r\nthat, at least as seen by the present writer, in this mixture of\r\nwhite and blue, the blue was always the preponderating colour; or,\r\nin other words, [p395] that, the field of the unoccupied zenith\r\nalways bore a large proportion to the space or spaces covered,\r\nhowever momentarily, with light, or with the luminous substance.\r\nFor the rest, the particular mentioned in the passage which has now\r\nbeen quoted, namely, that of the residue of a dusky track, after\r\nthe departure of the white light, did not, if it was there, attract\r\nthe attention of the present writer, upon the late occasion; but he\r\ncertainly, in many instances, remarked the return of the light to\r\nthe places in which it had been visible before; and this feature,\r\neither with or without that of the continuance of a dusky track,\r\nis possibly capable of adding some support to the general opinion\r\nwhich he conceived at the moment, which all subsequent information\r\nhas still allowed him to retain, and of which he proposes to make\r\nfurther use; namely, that the appearances in the zenith are only\r\nextended exhibitions of the luminous phenomena in the horizon, or\r\ntheir southern extremities, or the tops of columns projected from the\r\nnorthward. He thought that, in the zenith, he saw the same material,\r\nparcelled out, attenuated or diluted, spread thin, and, as it were,\r\nshown with greater transparency, with that which, in thicker volume,\r\nwith more accumulated strength, intenser light, with more solid body,\r\nand withal behind a denser mass of atmospherical vapour, arose, and\r\nglowed, and sometimes gloomed, in the horizon. But, be this as it\r\nmay, it is, perhaps, this upper part of the exhibition, in which the\r\nlights or streamers seem to interweave, or cross and recross each\r\nother, to dance in and out of the area, and to indulge in motions\r\nstill more capricious or anomalous than is probably the real fact; it\r\nis, perhaps, this upper part which has alternated, as before recalled\r\nto view, the names and similitudes of spears, gleaming, glittering,\r\ninterposing and clashing as in battle, and of _merry dancers_, the\r\nlatter the gayer comparison of the dancing north.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIV. The Aurora continued to fix the attention of the writer till\r\nbetween twelve and one o’clock of the morning of the 26th; and he\r\npresumes that it continued visible till the superior light of the\r\nrising day eclipsed its glory. The 26th was warm, but oppressed with\r\nfog, through which the sun broke [p396] only at intervals; and,\r\nbetween four and five o’clock in the evening, a small but steady\r\nrain commenced, and continued, or rather increased in heaviness,\r\ntill after midnight. Between eleven and twelve, while it still\r\nrained, the writer, on looking at the sky, which was covered with a\r\nuniform mass of clouds, the writer observed, from point to point,\r\nover the northern and southern hemispheres, a glow of ruddy light,\r\nwhich he suspected, and still suspects, to have been produced by the\r\nlight of the continued Aurora, reflected by the vapour. He took the\r\nopinion of a fellow-traveller, which coincided with his own; but it\r\nhas not come to his knowledge that any individual, himself and his\r\ncompanion excepted, has formed a similar conjecture—nor, indeed,\r\nis it impossible that it was no more than the light of the hidden\r\nmoon. The night of the 27th was star-light, though with fog near the\r\nsurface; and there was then no appearance of an Aurora. The night\r\nof the 28th was remarkably clear, and there was still no return of\r\nthe Aurora. The morning of the 29th was warm, with continued and\r\nheavy rain; but, after this, there succeeded a week or more of clear\r\nand dry weather; and these united particulars close the history of\r\nthe phenomenon, as far as belong to the personal observation of the\r\nwriter. The direction of the winds, and the state of the barometer\r\nand thermometer, were of the same general description, during many\r\ndays subsequent to the appearance of the Aurora on the 25th, as\r\nthat which had belonged to them from the 20th, and almost for many\r\ndays before, and of which the particulars have been stated above;\r\nand these remarks may merit record, as connected with the question\r\nof the ordinary duration of the Aurora, and of the weather by which\r\nit may be thought produced, or which it may be thought to bring. In\r\nmany instances, it has been observed, even in its splendour, and\r\neven in southern latitudes, for several nights in succession; and\r\nan influence upon the weather has likewise been expected from its\r\nappearance. Upon this occasion, there was no remarkable change in\r\nthe latter till the night of the fourteenth day after the Aurora\r\n(October 10th), when there occurred a violent gale of wind from\r\nthe south-west, accompanied with loud thunder, and the most vivid\r\nlightning; subsequently to which, as usual, [p397] the air, for a\r\nfew days, was felt to be cooler than before. It has been said, that a\r\ngale of wind, from the south-west, is always to be looked for within\r\ntwenty-four hours after the Aurora.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nV. The astronomical writer, already more than once mentioned,\r\nspeaking of the Aurora of the 25th of September, describes it as\r\n“that mysterious phenomenon;” and Mr. Adams, the meteorological\r\ncorrespondent of the publication referred to, records it as,\r\n“perhaps, as conspicuous as any that has ever been seen in\r\nEngland[122];” so that, assuming these impressions in both instances\r\nto be well founded, neither the present state of science upon the one\r\nhand, nor the specimen of the phenomenon upon the other, are such\r\nas to discourage either of the objects of the remainder of these\r\npages; namely, the one to contribute, as fully as possible, to the\r\ncompletion of a faithful account of the Aurora, as seen in London\r\nupon the late occasion, by uniting, and by analysing the descriptions\r\nthat have caught already the eye of the writer; and the other, to\r\ncorrect, and to enlarge if it should be practicable, the natural\r\nhistory of this description of meteor, by the comparison of what has\r\nhitherto been usually written upon the subject, either descriptively\r\nor philosophically, as well with the results of the late actual\r\nobservations, as with the several facts or opinions more anciently\r\nregistered. According to some, the interval which had elapsed, since\r\nan equal or a superior display of this phenomenon was witnessed in\r\nLondon, is twenty-four years, and, according to others, thirty-six;\r\nnor is the scanty list of examples scientifically recorded, at all\r\ninconsistent, from the wide separation, as well as irregularity\r\nof its dates, with such a view of the infrequency and uncertainty\r\nof any considerable appearance in other southern latitudes. The\r\nopportunity, therefore, now offered, ought not, perhaps, to be\r\nneglected; and the writer is not wholly without the prospect, that,\r\nupon a re-examination, both of opinions and facts, some safe and\r\ninevitable conclusions may be elicited, both as to the history\r\nand the theory of the meteor, hitherto, the one hastily received,\r\n[p398] and the other negligently overlooked, or unwarrantably\r\ncontradicted. The paragraphs, then, which immediately follow, will\r\nconnect and review the accounts of the writer’s fellow-observer of\r\nthe 25th of September; while those which succeed will be devoted to\r\na brief enumeration of statements already recorded in books; though,\r\nto a certain extent, both these paths will involve us in mixed\r\ninvestigations, historical and theoretical.\r\n\r\n1. “It first appeared,” says Mr. Adams, who dates from Edmonton, in\r\nMiddlesex, “about eight o’clock in the evening, as a strong white\r\nlight, much resembling the approach of sunrise; and so continued till\r\na short time after eleven, when a considerable number of dark clouds\r\ncollected toward the north and north-west, and several streaks of a\r\npale white light were seen proceeding from the clouds, and reaching\r\nnearly to the zenith. But the most remarkable part of the phenomenon\r\nwas exhibited in a N.N.E. direction, where, at about 30° above the\r\nhorizon, was a small dense cloud, above which was a broad streak\r\ncurved, and about 10° in length, varying in colour from a deep copper\r\nhue to a red.” “From this,” continues Mr. Adams, “the coruscations\r\nwere incessant, and remarkably bright, darting frequently to the\r\nzenith, where they were frequently crossed by others equally bright\r\nand numerous, proceeding from the west toward the east.”\r\n\r\n2. The astronomical writer, who dates from Deptford, describes\r\nthe phenomenon as commencing at a quarter past eight o’clock, and\r\ntravelling, from west and north-west, to north-east; and the streaks,\r\nor streamers, or, as he denominates them, the flashes, “converging\r\nto the zenith,” and “coruscating with great velocity.” He also\r\nparticularises the peculiar appearance of “a streak or column of a\r\nphosphorescent violet tinge;” and adds, “The _two_ red beams of\r\nlight, seen in the _easterly_ and _westerly_ direction [directions],\r\nwere diametrically opposite to each other, and ninety degrees distant\r\nfrom the violet light (by far the most luminous, though comparatively\r\nquiescent) which was to the west of north, _and therefore could not\r\nbe far from the magnetic meridian_, which would be crossed at right\r\nangles by a line joining the places of the red beams. The southern\r\nedges of these were accurately defined, not blending with the\r\nadjacent azure, but most distinct from it, and [p399] perpendicular\r\nto the horizon.” Finally, this gentleman speaks of the general\r\nluminous aspect, as “much resembling the tail of a comet,” and says,\r\nthat Ursa Major, and other stars, were visible through its medium;\r\nthat three meteoric stars also appeared, during the phenomenon, in\r\nthe east and north-east; and that the entire horizon was obscured by\r\ndark, heavy clouds, from three to five degrees in height[123].\r\n\r\n3. Besides these observers, two or three others, if not many more,\r\nless scientific, perhaps, but yet entitled to attention, have\r\ncommunicated to different newspapers their accounts of the same\r\nphenomena. “The metropolis,” says one of these, “was surprised on\r\nTuesday night by a brilliant display of Northern Lights, which but\r\nvery seldom stray so far south. The last which we beheld in London\r\nwere in the autumn of 1804, about the end of September, or beginning\r\nof October; and the fancied prodigy filled all the superstitious\r\nheads, at the time, with fearful prognostics, and loosened the\r\ntongues of a hundred prophets. The spectacle, then, was truly\r\nmagnificent. On Tuesday night (the 25th) the northern parts of the\r\nheavens displayed, about eleven o’clock, so ruddy a blaze, as to\r\nappear like the reflection of a mighty conflagration. An hour later,\r\nthe red hue was gone; but the whole horizon, from the north to the\r\neast, was lined with _a thin cloud_, from which the rays of light\r\nrolled, or sudden rays flashed up, and as suddenly vanished, to\r\nappear in a different part.” “At about half past eleven o’clock,”\r\nsays a second, “my attention was attracted to a singular appearance\r\nof light and streakiness in the sky. I observed it for nearly two\r\nhours. The sky, to the north, was obscured, for about fifteen degrees\r\nabove the horizon, by a _dense_ stratum of black clouds; from the\r\nupper edge of this, the light became first apparent, extending from\r\nnearly north-east to north-west, exceeding considerably in power\r\nthat arising from the moon just previous to its rising. From this\r\nbroad stratum of pale yellowish light shot beautiful _pencils_,\r\nof a luminous, hazy appearance, up to the very zenith, changing\r\nmomentarily in length and intensity. During this period, the wind\r\nblew gently from the south; and I frequently observed, that when it\r\nfreshened [p400] a little, the Aurora Borealis became more brilliant\r\nin its appearance, sending beautiful coruscations of light, in rapid\r\nsuccession, towards the zenith, and frequently passing that point ten\r\nor fifteen degrees to the southward. I have been assured, by those\r\nwho are well acquainted with this beautiful phenomenon, that they\r\nhave not seen any appearance of it equal in brilliancy and beauty\r\nto this, for upwards of six and thirty years.” “Last night,” says a\r\nthird, “we were favoured with that interesting phenomenon, the Aurora\r\nBorealis, or Northern Twilight, which so often amuses and cheers\r\nour neighbours in the north, but seldom, I believe, is seen in our\r\nlatitude. It was without those varied colours,” adds this writer,\r\n“which cause it to be a grand spectacle in those regions.” “Not\r\nfar from the horizon,” he adds, “in the northern hemisphere, were\r\ntransparent bodies of light, _eclipsing_ the brightness of the stars,\r\nwhich, however, were perceptible through it. From hence, beams of\r\nlight, varying in degrees of brightness and breadth, shot up towards\r\nthe zenith; here streamers of light flew from the east to the west,\r\nand from west to east. The southern hemisphere was cloudless, the\r\nstars shining with brilliancy. By the light of this phenomenon, I\r\ncould discern the time of night, which was between eleven and twelve,\r\nas well as other objects, as they appear on a moon-light night,\r\nwhen the moon is obscured by clouds.” “The sky in the north,” we\r\nare told by the fourth, “appeared as if a light shone from behind\r\nsome dark masses of clouds. As I approached Hampstead, the silvery\r\nlight was gradually tinged with rosy spiral streams, like those\r\nwhich sometimes precede the rising and follow the setting sun. These\r\nspiral red streaks did not appear to move quickly; but they were\r\nsubsequently followed by the _merry dancers_, which fully maintained\r\nthe character bestowed upon them by our northern neighbours. After\r\npassing through Hampstead, I crossed the heath, and came down what\r\nis called North-end Hill, to Golder’s Green, Hendon. When you arrive\r\nat the foot of the hill, you enter upon the open part of Golder’s\r\nGreen, where you have a clear and unobstructed view of the sky from\r\nwest to north. I never shall forget the grandeur of the scene which\r\nawaited me there. A continuous border of dark cloud skirted the\r\nhorizon completely from west to north, whilst [p401] from behind it,\r\nincessantly and rapidly shot up the most beautiful coruscations of\r\nwhite light, which, being relieved by the dark border, added double\r\nbrilliancy to the ever-shifting scene.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVI. But, after transcribing these respective accounts, it may be\r\npermitted, for the purpose of uniting them with that submitted in the\r\npreceding pages, to remark,\r\n\r\n1. That the account by Mr, Adams, of the appearance worn by the\r\nAurora at an early hour in the evening, is, no doubt, entirely\r\ncorrect; and that it is easy to understand, from this description of\r\nthat early appearance, why little observation was attracted to the\r\nphenomenon till about eleven o’clock at night, the time assigned, as\r\nwell in this, as in all the other accounts, for the commencement of\r\nthe phenomenon.\r\n\r\n2. That the “streaks of a pale white light,” which Mr. Adams\r\ndescribes as proceeding, a short time after eleven, “_from_ the\r\nclouds,” must be understood, as stated by the writer last quoted, as\r\nproceeding “_from behind_ the clouds;” that, when the astronomical\r\nwriter at Deptford speaks of Ursa Major and other stars being seen\r\nthrough the Aurora, it must be recollected, that, perhaps, this\r\nremark should apply to the medium of the thin and shifting lights in\r\nor near the zenith; and,\r\n\r\n3. That it is with respect to the “broad streak, curved,” of Mr.\r\nAdams; the “_two_ red beams of light,” of the astronomical observer\r\nat Deptford; and the “arch” of the present description, that the\r\nprincipal, if not only discordance obtains. Neither of the other\r\nthree writers appears to have seen any thing, whether of one “broad\r\nstreak, curved,” and “varying in colour from a deep copper hue to a\r\nred,” or of “_two_ red beams,” as spoken by the writer at Deptford;\r\nwhile, in each of the three accounts in which that part of the\r\nphenomenon is actually referred to, the descriptions are materially\r\ndissimilar:—\r\n\r\n1. The writer at Edmonton mentions only a single streak, while the\r\nwriter at Deptford speaks of _two_.\r\n\r\n2. The writer at Edmonton describes his single streak as curved,\r\nwhile the writer at Deptford says nothing of curvature; and, in\r\ndescribing the position of the beams as “perpendicular to the\r\nhorizon,” may seem to leave no curvature to be understood. [p402]\r\n\r\n3. The writer at Edmonton seems to lift his “broad curved streak”\r\nmuch above the horizon; for he first places a small dense cloud 30°\r\nabove the horizon, and, then, his broad streak above the cloud;\r\nthus describing a curve of which the situation was near the zenith,\r\nwhile the writer at Deptford is describing “two red beams,” standing\r\nperpendicularly to the horizon.\r\n\r\n4. The writer at Edmonton places his “broad streak, curved,” “in a\r\nN.N.E. direction;” while the writer at Deptford records “two red\r\nbeams of light, seen in the easterly and westerly direction.” Lastly,\r\n\r\n5. The writer at Edmonton seems to make coruscations, “incessant and\r\nremarkably bright,” dart from his “broad streak, curved;” while the\r\nwriter at Deptford seems only anxious to place his “two red beams,”\r\nas perpendicular pillars, standing on either side of the _magnetic\r\nmeridian_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVII. And, from the whole of this, from the total silence of four\r\naccounts, and from the extreme discordance of the other three, the\r\npresent writer presumes to draw the following inferences, including\r\nthat of the accuracy of his own original statement:\r\n\r\n1. That the two perpendicular red beams of light, of the writer\r\nat Deptford, should be joined with broad curved streaks of a deep\r\ncopper, or red hue, of the writer at Edmonton, to complete the _arch_\r\nwhich has been spoken of in the foregoing pages.\r\n\r\n2. That this _arch_, or curved streak, with its feet east and west,\r\nsent forth no coruscations itself; but that the coruscations rose\r\nbeneath it, and passed above it.\r\n\r\n3. That it was described upon the clouds only; was no part of\r\nthe Aurora; and, from its connexion with the clouds only, had\r\nan evanescence which, on the one hand, was the cause of the\r\nvarious descriptions, and, on the other, of no descriptions at\r\nall. The present writer observed this part of the phenomenon from\r\nits beginning to its ending. He saw it rise in the west, extend\r\nitself from the north, and descend in the east; and he thinks it\r\nreasonable to ascribe the variations concerning it, in the coincident\r\nnarratives, to the different points of time to which alone they\r\nreally refer. The writers at Edmonton [p403] and Deptford seem to\r\nhave had their attention fixed upon it at different epochs of its\r\nprogress; and all the four other writers, who have been cited, seem\r\nto speak of a time subsequent to its disappearance. The present\r\nwriter does not recollect the small cloud below it, spoken of by\r\nMr. Adams; but he well remembers the clouds above it, and along and\r\nnear the northern edge of which it seems to be formed. He does not\r\nrecollect seeing its definite _southern_ outline contrasted with the\r\nazure sky; but he well remembers seeing that outline contrasted with\r\nthe dark clouds above it, or to its southward; and also the contrast\r\nof its definite, _northern_ outline, as contrasted with the azure sky\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVIII. It is necessary to take notice, also, of what is said above,\r\nby the astronomical observer at Deptford, as to the “flashes\r\nconverging to the zenith,” and, further, of the omission, both by\r\nthis writer and by Mr. Adams, to speak of the curved beam, streamer,\r\nor coruscation, to the east of north, as described above. The whole\r\nveracity of the foregoing description depends upon the denial\r\nof a uniform convergence of the streamers, pillars, columns, or\r\ncoruscations toward the zenith; nor was it, in all probability, the\r\nintention of the writer at Deptford, to assert any such convergence,\r\nbut only to speak of those coruscations, or shifting lights, in the\r\nzenith, which are described by Mr. Adams as crossing each other from\r\neast to west. It is remarkable, at the same time, that neither the\r\none nor the other of these writers have mentioned that direct reverse\r\nof convergence which marked the general figure and arrangement of\r\nthe streamers or columns of the Aurora, and which was so opposite to\r\nwhat would have been given to it by the phenomenon of convergence.\r\nIndeed, the violent curve of the extreme column to the N. E. or N.\r\nN. E., shrouded, too, as that column was with a body of dense vapour\r\nthrough which its light appeared of a deep and dull red colour, might\r\nmake the description of this itself answer to the “broad streak,\r\ncurved,” of Mr. Adams, if we were not certain, from other particulars\r\nmentioned, that Mr. Adams really refers to the curve which formed\r\npart of the _arch_. For the rest, no mention of the real directions\r\nof the several columns having been made by any observer of the Aurora\r\nof the 25th [p404] of September but himself, and especially none of\r\nthe outward curve of the easternmost column, it is satisfactory to\r\nthe writer to have found an account of an appearance similar to this\r\nlast, in an Aurora of which he will presently have occasion to speak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIX. Finally, there is an observation to be made upon that part of\r\nthe description, by the second correspondent of the newspapers,\r\nwhere it is said, that during the appearance of the coruscations\r\nin the zenith, “the wind blew gently from the south,” and the\r\nspectator “frequently observed, that when it freshened a little,\r\nthe Aurora Borealis became more brilliant in its appearance;” to\r\nwhich it may also seem the writer’s intention to add,—“sending\r\nbeautiful coruscations of light, in rapid succession toward the\r\nzenith, and frequently passing that point, ten or fifteen degrees to\r\nthe southward.” Now the reality of any dependence of the light and\r\nmotion of the Aurora upon the freshening of the breeze, would seem\r\ntoo strongly to affect the question of the nature and action of the\r\n_auroral matter_, to be admitted without cautious examination. In\r\ntruth, what was it that constituted the luminous matter which we saw\r\nin the zenith? The stars were visible through it. But for luminous\r\nappearances that flew or skimmed along the heavens, we should have\r\nsaid, that the latter were clear, and that there was nothing but the\r\npurest atmosphere between the earth and the heavens. Was it, then,\r\nthe atmospherical matter which was thus illuminated, and which, being\r\nruffled by the breeze, can be supposed to have really exhibited\r\nthe appearances described by this writer, or, was it not, rather,\r\nilluminated _auroral matter_, which was shot through the atmosphere;\r\nand, if this last, how are we to understand that its brilliance, and\r\nstill less the frequency and vigour of its coruscations, could have\r\nbeen affected by the freshening of the breeze?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nX. But, taking, now, a final leave of the description of the Aurora\r\nof the 25th of September, and of the observations specially suggested\r\nby it, let us here examine the several particulars which are commonly\r\noffered as part, at least, of its true history; an undertaking,\r\nfor the greater convenience of which the account given in a modern\r\nwork of much and [p405] deserved reputation, shall be quoted and\r\nconsidered sentence by sentence, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. “AURORA BOREALIS, _Northern Light_, or _Streamers_; a kind of\r\nmeteor, appearing in the Northern part of the heavens, mostly in the\r\nwinter time, and in frosty weather.\r\n\r\n2. “It is in the Arctic regions that it appears in perfection,\r\nparticularly during the solstice.\r\n\r\n3. “In the Shetland Islands, the Merry Dancers, as they are called,\r\nare the constant attendants of clear evenings, and prove great\r\nreliefs amidst the gloom of the long winter nights.\r\n\r\n4. “They commonly appear at twilight, near the horizon, of a dun\r\ncolour, approaching to yellow; sometimes continuing in that state,\r\nfor several hours, without any sensible motion, after which they\r\nbreak out into streams of stronger light, spreading into columns, and\r\naltering slowly into ten thousand different shapes, varying their\r\ncolours from all the tints of yellow to the obscurest russet.\r\n\r\n5. “They often cover the whole hemisphere, and then make the most\r\nbrilliant appearance.\r\n\r\n6. “Their motions, at these times, are most amazingly quick, and they\r\nastonish the spectators with the rapid change of their form.\r\n\r\n7. “They break out in places where none were seen before, skimming\r\nbriskly along the heavens; are suddenly extinguished, and leave\r\nbehind a uniform dusky track.\r\n\r\n8. “This again is brilliantly illuminated in the same manner, and as\r\nsuddenly left a dull blank.\r\n\r\n9. “In certain nights, they assume the appearance of vast columns; on\r\none side of the deepest yellow, on the other, declining away till it\r\nbecomes undistinguished from the sky.\r\n\r\n10. “They have generally a tremulous motion from end to end, which\r\ncontinues till the whole vanishes.\r\n\r\n11. “In a word, we, who only see the extremities of these northern\r\nphenomena, have but a faint idea of their splendour and their motions.\r\n\r\n12. “According to the state of the atmosphere, they differ in colour.\r\n\r\n13. “They often put on the colour of blood, and then make a most\r\ndreadful appearance[124].” [p406]\r\n\r\n1. Now, with respect to the first and second of the sentences here\r\ntranscribed, there seems reason to doubt the accuracy of the account\r\nwhich almost limits the appearances of the Aurora to the “winter\r\ntime,” to “frosty weather,” and especially to the winter “solstice.”\r\nThe frequency with which the season approaching to Christmas, or that\r\nof the winter solstice, is distinguished by the occurrence of weather\r\npeculiarly mild, insomuch that, almost every year, the period is\r\nmarked by observations upon what is annually called the extraordinary\r\nand unseasonable genialness of the weather, cowslips blooming, leaves\r\nbudding, and birds building their nests; this frequency of a mild\r\ntemperature of the air about the period of the winter solstice, may\r\njustify, even under a general view, a doubt of the accuracy with\r\nwhich, as things of course, the winter solstice, and frosty weather,\r\nare spoken of as arriving in conjunction. But, that the appearance\r\nof the Aurora Borealis is not peculiar, either to the occurrence of\r\nfrosty weather, or to the period of the winter solstice, whether\r\nthe two latter phenomena are related or otherwise, seems probable,\r\nas well from the mildness of the weather at the late appearance,\r\nas from the various seasons of the year in which the few others\r\ndescribed in our books are recorded to have presented themselves.\r\nThe earliest mentioned was seen in London in the year 1560, on the\r\n30th day of January. The next was in 1564, on the 7th of October.\r\nThe next, in 1574, on the 14th and 15th of November. The two next,\r\nobserved in Brabant, in 1575, on the 25th of February, and 28th of\r\nSeptember. The next, at Wurtemburg, as we are assured by Meestlin,\r\nseven times, in the year 1580. The next, in an extraordinary manner,\r\nin the months of April and September, 1581; and in a less degree,\r\nat some other places, in the same year. The next, observed all over\r\nFrance, in 1621, on the 2nd of September. The next in 1707,and 1708,\r\nduring which two years the Aurora was witnessed five times. The\r\nnext, in the month of March, in 1715–16. The next, in 1737, on the\r\n16th of December; that seen in London in 1791, of the month of which\r\nthe writer is uninformed; another in 1803, or 1804, at the latter\r\nof September, or the beginning of October; and this, of 1827, on\r\nthe 25th of September. But, from these statements, it is now seen,\r\nthat, [p407] exclusive of appearances of the Aurora in respect of\r\nwhich the month is not particularised, eight of the different months\r\nof the year occur by name; that is to say, the months of September,\r\nOctober, November, and December, January, February, March, and\r\nApril; leaving only four months (May, June, July, and August, the\r\nidentical summer-months of the Polar regions, or months during which\r\nthe sun visits the Polar horizon!) hitherto undistinguished by the\r\nphenomenon of the Aurora, and almost establishing, as the season of\r\nits occurrence, not the middle point of the winter solstice, but the\r\nwhole period extending, in general terms, from the autumnal equinox\r\nto the vernal, beginning at or before the first, and ending at or\r\nafter the last; or, what may be called the entire winter of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, or the period during which the sun’s course is\r\nto the southward of the tropic of Cancer; a deduction from the scanty\r\ndata offered by such archives of the phenomenon as we possess, not,\r\nperhaps, of trifling importance toward the establishment of the true\r\ntheory of the cause, as well as of the purpose of its being.\r\n\r\n2. The third sentence, where it describes the Aurora Borealis as the\r\n_constant_ attendant of clear evenings in the Shetland Islands, and\r\nthereby a great relief to the gloom of the long winter-nights, is\r\nprobably tainted with errors in regard to the phenomenon, such as\r\naffect its whole history and philosophy. The suggestion has just been\r\nhazarded above, that at least considerable displays of the Aurora are\r\nprobably almost as rare, even in the Arctic regions, as in climates\r\nfurther south; and the truth of this persuasion, as the writer\r\nanticipates, will fully appear below. In the sentence now referred\r\nto, the word “constant” should, at least, give way to “frequent,”\r\nif not to “often;” and a distinction should be allowed for, between\r\nthose feeble appearances which alone, it may be suspected, are even\r\n_often_ beheld in the Shetland Islands, and those extraordinary\r\ndisplays which make themselves visible to their southward.\r\n\r\n3. The fourth of the above sentences, in which the Aurora is said\r\nto appear commonly at twilight, will have been seen to agree with\r\nthe time assigned for the commencement of the Aurora in the late\r\nexample; and this, when coupled with the [p408] observation in the\r\nthird, that, in the Shetland Islands, it is the constant attendant of\r\n_clear_ evenings, will seem to suggest, what, indeed, will probably\r\nbe easily agreed to, that the Aurora, in itself, is peculiar neither\r\nto clear evenings nor to evenings at all; but is in activity during\r\nthe twenty-four hours, or without intermission; though, to be visible\r\nto human eyes, first, the atmosphere must be dark, and, secondly, it\r\nmust be more or less clear. It may also be thought apparent, from\r\nthe terms of the twelfth and thirteenth sentences, that too much\r\nhas not been said by the present writer, of the degree in which the\r\npeculiar spectacle, upon each separate occasion, depends, not alone\r\nof the proper and really uniform features of the Aurora itself, but\r\nalso of the atmosphere through which it is seen, with the appearance\r\nof which its own appearance is combined; and of the consequent\r\nvalue of a careful separation of the real phenomena of the Aurora,\r\nfrom the adventitious phenomena of the intervening and surrounding\r\natmosphere. That the colours which, whether visibly connected with\r\nthe atmosphere or otherwise, are displayed during the appearance of\r\nthe Aurora Borealis, are wholly derived from the atmospherical medium\r\nthrough which we behold it, and that the Aurora itself exhibits\r\nonly a pure white light, is what the writer greatly inclines to\r\nsuspect, and what may seem to be rendered still more credible by\r\nthat which is reported by those who have obtained a partial glimpse\r\nof the Aurora _Australis_, or corresponding phenomenon of the south.\r\nThis is described, by Mr. Forster, who sailed round the world with\r\nCaptain Cook, as consisting in “long columns of clear white light;”\r\nbut the whiteness, in the eyes of the narrator, seemed to establish\r\na difference, instead of a similitude, between the Auroræ Australis\r\nand Borealis, Mr. F. wholly overlooking the explanation which his own\r\naccount supplies! “These columns,” says he, “though in most respects\r\nsimilar to the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) of our hemisphere,\r\nyet differed from them in being always of a whitish colour, whereas\r\nours assume various tints, especially those of a fiery or purple hue.\r\nThe sky was generally clear when they appeared, and the air sharp\r\nand cold, the thermometer standing at the freezing point.” Now this\r\ntext is its own commentary. The [p409] Aurora could not have been\r\nseen if the sky had not been more or less _clear_. But the sky was\r\n_very clear_; and this because the weather was _severely frosty_.\r\nThe thermometer “was standing at the freezing point.” The weather\r\nwas settled frosty, and therefore settled clear; for the Aurora\r\nappeared for “several following nights.” The atmosphere, therefore,\r\nwas clear; there was neither cloud nor fog, and thence the whiteness\r\nof the Aurora. But these views of the Aurora _Australis_ were\r\npartial occurrences, and were characterised, as we must conclude,\r\nby the state of the atmosphere at a particular conjuncture, or at\r\na particular season of the year. In point of fact, the Aurora was\r\nseen on the 16th of February, 1773, in latitude 58° S. This was the\r\nbeginning of the Australian winter, and it might be a very cold, and\r\ntherefore a very clear beginning. But the atmosphere of the southern\r\nhalf of the globe is not always thus translucent; and when it is\r\notherwise, we may depend upon it that the columns of its Aurora\r\n“assume various colours; especially those of a fiery and purple\r\nhue,” more or less like our own. A friend of the present writer\r\nwas in the same latitude (58° 12′ S.) in the month of March, a few\r\nyears since; and, upon asking that gentleman whether he had ever\r\nbeheld an Aurora in the Southern Hemisphere, his answer was in the\r\nnegative. The season of his visit, however, was a month later in\r\nthe southern winter than the visit of Messrs. Cook and Forster; the\r\nweather was thick and sleety; it was unfavourable to any view of an\r\nAurora at all; but, had the phenomenon happened to present itself,\r\nits appearance, we may believe, would not have presented that of a\r\nuniform, clear, white light.\r\n\r\n4. In the fourth and sixth sentences, what is said of “change of\r\nshape,” and “change of form,” is of a nature exceedingly to mislead\r\nsuch as, never having themselves witnessed the phenomenon, may\r\ndesire either to figure it to their imagination, or to reason upon\r\nits appearances. In reality, there is no such change of shape or\r\nform as the words naturally suggest to our ideas; the forms, under\r\nall changes, are still linear; and the actual changes, as to form,\r\nare limited to such changes only as can be produced with the single\r\nmaterial of lines, lengthened, shortened, varied in their direction,\r\nand now fixed, now shaken, now darting; and now joined in rapid and\r\nintermingling motion. [p410] Add, that these lines are luminous,\r\nand varied in colour from white to yellow, red, and crimson, and,\r\nsometimes, perhaps, to purple and to violet; that they play, in the\r\nlower heavens in a field of light, and in the upper over a sky of\r\nblue; and the picture of the Aurora Borealis is well nigh complete.\r\nThe observation in the ninth sentence, that the vast columns, of\r\nwhich, upon some occasions, the Aurora displays the forms, are of a\r\ndeep yellow upon one side, which, upon the other, fades gradually\r\ninto that of the sky, is to be understood, as expressing, that, as in\r\nthe late example, the outer edges of the columns, or those next the\r\ndark or unillumined portion of the horizon, are sharp and strongly\r\ndefined; while the inner ones are less distinguished from the general\r\nfield of light in which they stand; and which distinction, after\r\nall, is but a delusion of the eye, which more readily distinguishes\r\nthe variation of colour in the outer edge, which is so strongly\r\nrelieved by the dark and colder-coloured part of the sky, than the\r\ncolour of the inner part and edge of the column, which, more or less,\r\napproaches that of the ground behind it.\r\n\r\n5. Sentences seven and eight appear to the present writer to convey\r\nthe most accurate description possible, of the appearance of the\r\nAurora in the _zenith_. The “dusky track,” which remains after\r\nthe lights which have enlivened it are extinguished, and in which\r\nthey are so often seen again, may seem to attest the justice of\r\nhis opinion, that these appearances in the zenith are no other\r\nthan the far-projected tops of the columns which have their bases\r\nin, or rather below, the horizon; tops which, while they fill the\r\nsouthern half of the zenith, to the view of spectators under our\r\nparallel, must gradually descend toward the horizon, in the eyes of\r\nsuch as behold them further and still further to the south; till,\r\nlike the topmast of a receding ship, they first scarcely remain\r\ndiscoverable above the convexity of the surface intervening, and\r\nfinally dip and sink beneath it. But, upon this assumption, the\r\nappearance, and therefore office, of the Aurora Borealis, must\r\nbe conceived as extending far to the southward of even our own\r\nisland; and the statement, as in the eleventh sentence, becomes\r\nmore or less inaccurate, that “only the extremities of these\r\nnorthern phenomena” are witnessed by ourselves. In reality we are\r\n[p411] ourselves inhabitants of the Northern hemisphere; and the\r\nrelationship of the Aurora to the wants of the whole hemisphere is\r\nmore extended, perhaps, than we have commonly imagined. It is even\r\na contradiction to say, as in the eleventh sentence, that we see\r\nonly the extremities, that is, the Southern extremities of these\r\nNorthern phenomena, after having said, in the fifth sentence, that\r\n“they often cover the whole heavens, and then make the most brilliant\r\nappearance;” unless, indeed, in both of these remarks reference\r\nis made to the spectacle beheld under more Northerly parallels, a\r\nreference which is further suggested, together with their apparent\r\norigin, in the terms of a description by Gmelin, to be cited below,\r\nof the Aurora as beheld upon the coasts of the Icy Sea; If the\r\nAurora, there, or upon the banks of the Lena or Yenesei, is seen\r\nto rise in the north, but yet to stretch itself over the whole\r\nhemisphere, it must follow, that its “extremities,” that is, its\r\nsouthern extremities, so far from being all that is seen in these\r\nsituations, are really projected, on those occasions, so far to the\r\nsouthward, as to escape the ken of our northern optics; a fact of\r\nwhich the explanation must be familiar, inasmuch as, owing to the\r\nconvexity of the surface of the globe, the horizon of every part is\r\nnarrowly bounded, whether upon the South or upon the North; whence\r\nit results, that any celestial, or even atmospherical appearance,\r\nstretching only a little way beyond us to the Southward, or toward\r\nthe East, or toward the West, must soon reach the horizon upon\r\neither of those sides, and thus cover all that, to the eye of any\r\nindividual, is visible of the “whole hemisphere.”\r\n\r\n6. But the description, by Gmelin, of the Aurora, as seen upon the\r\nshores of the Icy Sea, and more than all, the simplicity with which\r\nthe naturalist is disposed to fix its birth-place in that precise\r\ninterval of the earth’s surface which divides the mouth of the river\r\nYenesei from that of the river Lena, in the North-east of Asia, (a\r\nspot so far to the _North-eastward_, too, of our own!) while it may\r\npossibly explain the origin or bearing of remarks, that it “sometimes\r\ncovers the whole hemisphere, and then makes the most brilliant\r\nappearance,” will also afford something of an answer to such as, with\r\nthe writer quoted above, seeking to connect the Aurora Borealis with\r\nthe [p412] Magnetic Pole, would discover its same birth-place, or\r\nfocus, in the _North-west_, or nearer to the North-west of America,\r\nthan to the North-east of Asia! It may furnish a reply, also, to\r\nGmelin himself, who, though he tells us that, even upon the banks of\r\nthe Lena and Yenesei, the Aurora is still seen to rise to the North\r\nor North-east of those situations, yet imagines those very banks to\r\nbe its “real birth-place;” for is it not plain, in the meantime,\r\nand this from the very statement of the author, that, travel as far\r\nnorthward, or north-eastward, as we will, the birth-place of the\r\nAurora still retires from our feet; that, even upon the shores of the\r\nIcy Sea, the joyous phantom is still to our Northward, or North-east,\r\nand that we may reasonably conclude, that even a voyage upon that\r\nsea would not carry us to the cradle in pursuit; that, in short, at\r\nthe North Pole, we should still behold it rise in the North, or the\r\nNorth-east, or the North-west; that we might sail down the Western\r\nHemisphere, and yet only discover, that the Aurora was now in the\r\nNorth behind our backs, as it had been before in the North before our\r\nfaces; and that, in short, so long as we do but admit its existence\r\nin the North, the particular soil or sea is best described in the\r\nmost general terms:—\r\n\r\n “In Nova Zembla, or the Lord knows where!”\r\n\r\nThe search, too, for the paternal hearth of the Aurora Borealis in\r\nany particular division of the Northern Hemisphere, and especially\r\nthe attempt to find it at the Magnetic or Electric Pole, is, perhaps,\r\nso much the more hopeless, after ascertaining, as above, that each\r\nhemisphere has its Aurora; and after concluding, as we may have\r\nbeen led to conclude with reason, that each Aurora, other things\r\nequal, resembles the other! What is remarkable, also, is that, in\r\nthe Southern Hemisphere, as well as, according to Gmelin, in the\r\nNorthern, it is to the Eastward, or to the East of North, that the\r\nAurora has its apparent focus. “A beautiful phenomenon,” says Mr.\r\nForster, (Feb. 17, 1773, lat. 58° S.) “had been observed during the\r\npreceding night, which appeared again this and several following\r\nnights. It consisted of long columns of white light, shooting up from\r\nthe horizon to the eastward, almost to the zenith, and gradually\r\nspreading over the whole southern part of the sky. These columns\r\nare gradually bent sideways [p413] at their upper extremities; and,\r\nthough in most respects similar to the Northern Lights (Aurora\r\nBorealis) of our hemisphere, yet differed from them in being always\r\nof a whitish colour; whereas ours assume various colours, especially\r\nthese of a fiery or purple-hue. The sky was generally clear when they\r\nappeared, and the air sharp and cold; the thermometer standing at the\r\nfreezing point.” This occasional bending of the columns, “sideways\r\nat their upper extremities,” instead of uniform convergence toward\r\nthe zenith, observed by Mr. Forster in the Aurora of the South, is\r\nplainly the same peculiarity which was recently witnessed in London,\r\nin the Aurora of the North, and a circumstance which, in whatever\r\nway explained, assists in the identification of the natures of the\r\ntwo phenomena; and, if we are still to hesitate, upon account of the\r\nwhiter light of that of the South, let us believe that particular to\r\noriginate in some peculiar constitution of the Southern atmosphere,\r\nfrom which, in one way or another, not here to be discussed, the\r\ncause of the difference may offer itself. But Gmelin’s account of\r\nthe Aurora of the North, to which the attention of the reader has\r\nalready been called, is that which is here required to follow. It is\r\nto serve to illustrate, as will be remembered, much of the foregoing:\r\n“This Northern Light,” says that author, “begins with the rising of\r\nsingle light pillars in the North, and almost at the same time in the\r\nNorth-east, which, gradually increasing, fill a large space in the\r\nheavens, rush about, from place to place, with incredible velocity,\r\nand finally almost cover the whole sky, up to the zenith: the streams\r\nare then seen meeting together in the zenith, where they produce an\r\nappearance as if a vast tent was expanded in the heavens, glittering\r\nwith gold, rubies, and sapphires. A more beautiful spectacle cannot\r\nbe described; but whoever should witness such a Northern Light for\r\nthe first time, could not behold it without terror; for, however\r\nbeautiful the illumination may be, it is attended, as I have learned\r\nfrom the relation of many persons, with a hissing, crackling, and\r\nrushing noise, throughout the air, as if the largest fireworks were\r\nplaying off. To describe what they then hear, they make use of\r\nthe expression, ‘Spolochi chodjat;’ that is, ‘The furious army is\r\npassing!’ The hunters, who, upon the confines of the [p414] Icy Sea,\r\nfollow the chase of the blue and white foxes, are often overtaken in\r\ntheir excursions by the Northern Light; and, upon this occurrence,\r\ntheir dogs are so much frightened, that they will not move, but cower\r\nobstinately upon the ground till the noise is over. The weather,\r\nafter the appearance of the Northern Light, is usually clear and\r\ncalm. I have heard these accounts, not from one person only, but from\r\nmany of those who have spent several years in these very Northerly\r\nregions, and inhabited different countries from the Yenesei to the\r\nLena, so that no doubt of its truth can remain; for here seems to be\r\nthe real birth-place of the Aurora Borealis.”\r\n\r\n8. Upon this statement itself, it is only needful to remark, that the\r\nrising of the pillars in the North-east, or to the East of North,\r\nrather than to the North-west, or West of North, almost at the same\r\ntime with their first appearance in the North, is not, perhaps,\r\neven as seen between the Lena and Yenesei, so uniformly the case as\r\nM. Gmelin may have been led to believe; and that, at all events,\r\nas above described, the progress of the late display, observed in\r\nLondon, was, first from North to West, and afterward from West to\r\nEast; the North being always the centre, or always light, while the\r\nWest and East were changed. The covering of the whole sky, and the\r\nsplendour of the scene produced, have been the subject of previous\r\nremark; and the observation, “that the streams (previously called\r\npillars) are then seen meeting together in the zenith,” entirely\r\ncorroborates what the present writer has said of the nature of the\r\nlights seen skimming across the zenith, and across each other, and\r\nthe deduction which he has thence made, that the luminous appearances\r\nin the zenith are the summits of those very pillars of which the\r\nbases are on or below the horizon. The clear and calm weather which,\r\non the shores of the Icy Sea, commonly follows the appearance of\r\nthe Aurora is, in some degree, in concord with the phenomena of its\r\nrecent appearance in London; where, without any material change\r\nin the temperature, a succession of clear, calm, and bright days\r\nsupervened, within a day or two of the Aurora. As to the hissing,\r\ncrackling, or rushing noise, which is said to accompany the Aurora\r\nin the more northern regions, and which has sometimes been compared\r\nto that of the furling and [p415] unfurling of flags, there is\r\nnothing difficult, (knowing what we do of the noise of winds and of\r\nthunder,) in admitting its probability, unless what may arise from\r\nthe consideration, that the noise might, or might not, be expected\r\nto be heard, where-ever the phenomenon is to be seen. But the most\r\nstriking and important truth, communicated in the foregoing account,\r\nis that which we cannot but rigorously infer from the collective\r\ntestimony of two very distinct descriptions, which is afforded in two\r\nof the concluding sentences. It consists in that real _infrequency_,\r\nas well in the Northern, as in the Southern Hemisphere, of the\r\nappearance of the Aurora; an _infrequency_ the knowledge of which is\r\nso essential to the true history of the phenomenon, and therefore\r\nto its true philosophy, and consequently to much of the history and\r\nphilosophy of nature at large;—an _infrequency_ which the present\r\nwriter has given notice of above, as a proposition for which, in\r\ndissent from all received authorities, he will contend; and upon the\r\nopposite account of which matter, in the general account quoted,\r\nhe has already requested the reader to suspend his judgment. It is\r\nobvious that, as a natural phenomenon, an Aurora Borealis, which,\r\nthough _constantly_ experienced in the more Northerly regions, is but\r\nrarely observed in the more Southern; that is, an Aurora Borealis\r\nwhich, though familiar to the Samoiede, the Laplander, and even\r\nthe Shetlander, is an extraordinary, and a terrific, or at least a\r\nmarvellous event, to the Italian, the Frenchman, and even to the\r\nEnglishman; it is obvious, that such an Aurora Borealis, _constant_\r\nin its occurrence a little further to the Northward, and almost\r\nthe solitary spectacle of a generation a little further to the\r\nSouth, is, as a natural phenomenon, a very different thing from an\r\nAurora Borealis which, though far enough to the South, sufficiently\r\nfrequent in comparatively trivial magnitudes and lustre, is seen,\r\neither in the South or in the North, in its greatness, and in its\r\nsplendour, but yet rarely, and with, perhaps, almost equal rareness;\r\nit is obvious that, as natural phenomena, and not less so as sights\r\nconnected by mankind with their own fortunes, the two things now\r\ndescribed are exceedingly unlike as matter of history, and equally so\r\nas matter of philosophy. If we are simply to record the occurrence,\r\nit is one thing to speak of a phenomenon [p416] which, in the South,\r\nis seen only at long intervals, while it is a “constant attendant”\r\nin the North; and another thing to speak of that which, whether\r\nin the South or in the North, is equally rare, and equally out of\r\nthe “constant” course of nature. If we are to write the history of\r\nnature, it is one thing to relate, that such phenomena, or rather\r\nothers, infinitely more splendid, more terrific, or more marvellous,\r\nthan that which was witnessed in London, in the month of September\r\nin this year, or in the same month some three-and-twenty years ago,\r\nor else some six-and-thirty, and, to judge by experience, is not\r\nto be looked for, in the same city, during twenty or thirty years\r\nagain;—it is one thing to relate that, in the Shetland Islands,\r\nsuch a spectacle is a “constant attendant of clear evenings,” and\r\nanother thing to relate, that though, perhaps, on clear evenings,\r\nin the Shetland Islands, some small displays of the Aurora are\r\nnot unfrequently perceived, yet, that such an exhibition as has\r\nrecently been witnessed in London, and still more, such as, more\r\neffulgent, and more extended, and more vigorous, and even coloured\r\nby the atmosphere into the terrific;—that those exhibitions, in\r\nshort, of which our naturalists and men of science would persuade\r\nus, that, while beheld nightly by those of the North, they are known\r\nto us by very faint examples alone;—those exhibitions,—that those\r\nextraordinary examples of the brightness and vigour of the Aurora—are\r\nas rare, or almost as rare, not only in the Shetland Islands, but\r\nin Iceland, and on the shores of the Icy Sea, as in the streets of\r\nLondon themselves! It is obvious, too, that if we are to speak of\r\nthis phenomenon philosophically, if we are to attempt to explain its\r\norigin and use,—its source in the natural elements, and its office in\r\nthe natural economy; here, too, the solving of this question of the\r\n_frequency_ or _infrequency_, the _constancy_ or the _inconstancy_,\r\nof these mighty exhibitions, even in the North, and under the Pole\r\nitself, is matter of foremost importance. And what is the testimony,\r\nupon these heads, which is borne by the accounts collected by Gmelin?\r\nIs the Northern Light of the German naturalist, the apparently\r\nconstant attendant of clear evenings, even in the countries between\r\nthe Lena and the Yenesei? Is the spectacle, and the atmospherical\r\nhurley, which seems to rush over the [p417] hunting-grounds of\r\nthe hunters and their dogs, and which frightens the very dogs, and\r\npins them to the ground till it is passed, or has seemed to pass;\r\nis this the “constant attendant of clear evenings,” or, is it a\r\nprodigy so uncommon as to defy familiarity? But, if this evidence is\r\ninsufficient, let us look to what is said of its influence, in these\r\ncountries, on the subsequent state of the atmosphere. So far from the\r\nAurora being an attendant or follower of clear evenings, it seems\r\nthat clear evenings follow the Aurora! It is said, that after its\r\noccurrence, clear and calm weather is customary to follow; and, here,\r\nthe expression itself is implicative of the rarity of the occurrence.\r\nIf it were constant, how should this result come to be noticed;\r\nand, indeed, if the Aurora Borealis were the constant attendant of\r\neach twenty-four hours, and if clear weather were usually in the\r\ntrain of the Aurora Borealis, how could it ordinarily happen, that\r\nthere should be any thing else than clear weather, in the countries\r\nvisited by the Aurora, or any foul weather for the Aurora to dispel?\r\nYet, such is the established prejudice concerning this supposed\r\nfrequency of the more powerful displays of the Aurora in the climates\r\nfurther to the North than our own, that a writer, quoting the very\r\nstatement above, absolutely prefaces it with the remark, that\r\nGmelin, in pointed terms, speaks of the Aurora as “frequent,” as\r\nwell as “very loud,” “in the North-eastern parts of Siberia[125]!” A\r\nsimple perusal, in the meantime, is sufficient to show, that Gmelin\r\nsays nothing affirmative as to its _frequency_; while a slight\r\nconsideration of the facts which he adduces must satisfy us, as no\r\ndoubt they satisfied Gmelin himself, that the occurrence, even in\r\nSiberia, is actually _infrequent_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXI. In reference, however, as well to the image presented above, of\r\n“a vast tent expanded in the heavens, glittering with gold, rubies,\r\nand sapphires;” as also to many less ambitious and figurative\r\ndescriptions of the spectacle of the Aurora Borealis, (not excepting\r\nthat indicted by himself,) the author is anxious to suggest a caution\r\nagainst the too exaggerated conception of the realities intended.\r\nWords, [p418] upon such occasions, are rarely more than imperfect\r\npictures, presenting but feeble likenesses, and either deficient or\r\nexcessive in the amount of beauty, or of the reverse, of whatever\r\nkind, which they attempt to copy from their originals; and the\r\ninconvenience is seriously great, whenever the object portrayed is\r\nwholly strange to the mind before which it is placed. The imperfect\r\npower, both of words and written characters, to convey precise, and\r\nsometimes even tolerable ideas, of the objects, either sensible or\r\nabstract, which they are intended to represent, and the superior\r\nintelligibility so often belonging to diagrams or figures, or other\r\nresources of the art of drawing, (the primitive, and, for so many\r\npurposes, the most instructive mode of writing[126],) would have\r\nled the present writer, had time permitted, to endeavour, as often\r\nas possible, to elucidate by such means the several parts of the\r\nforegoing observations; but which means, at last, and in reference to\r\nthe actual phenomena of the Aurora, would necessarily fail to convey\r\nthe due, and yet no more than the due impression, to such as are\r\nwholly without its ocular acquaintance. We are little aware how much,\r\nupon ordinary occasions, our understanding of words heard or read is\r\nassisted by our previous knowledge of the sensible objects, or of\r\nthe acquired notions, to which they refer; and the examples would be\r\nendless, of the sensible objects preposterously misconceived, as well\r\nas the propositions made false or ridiculous, through the frequent\r\ninadequacy of words to communicate truths entirely new [p419] to the\r\ndisciple. Even the history of opinions concerning the Aurora Borealis\r\nitself, might be cited upon this very point.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary and natural resource, in such circumstances, is\r\ncomparison; but even comparison has been the source of great and\r\nendless errors of description. Of the degree of resemblance proposed\r\nbetween the known and the unknown, there is no common measure for\r\nthe minds of the hearer and the listener, and the point or points\r\nof comparison intended by the first must often be mistaken by the\r\nsecond; or, if reference is made to a similitude under one aspect,\r\nthe imagination conceives a resemblance also under another: thus,\r\nif it is said, that an unknown animal is as _large_ as a horse,\r\nthe idea of the _figure_ also of a horse, is apt to be attached. A\r\nmodern English work of science premises, upon the subject of the\r\nAurora Borealis, that its appearance is so well known as to render\r\ndescription needless. It is true that the work referred to is\r\nprinted in the Northern part of the island, where the phenomenon is\r\ndoubtless more familiar than in the Southern; but, in the foregoing\r\npages themselves, it has, perhaps, been demonstrated as probably\r\ncertain, that if it is any where sufficiently known to render\r\ndescription trite for the common eye, it has at least never hitherto\r\nbeen described with sufficient precision for the aid of speculative\r\nresearch. To attempt to explain its _cause_, and to relate its\r\nentire history, its _appearance_ must first be either observed or\r\ndescribed with accuracy; and we have seen, above, that some of the\r\nmost scientific reasonings which have hitherto been offered as to\r\nthe former, are wholly inapplicable to the true peculiarities of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nConsidered simply as a visual object, and as a meteor differing\r\nfrom all others, and especially from all other luminous meteors,\r\nin this, that its duration extends to hours, if not to days and\r\nmonths; the only resemblance, perhaps, that can be suggested, is to\r\nthat description of lightning which is called _heat-lightning_, the\r\nfrequent companion of our summer-evenings. But, here, the similitude\r\nis inexpressibly feeble; since heat-lightning has nothing, either of\r\nthe splendour, the volume, or the beauty of the Aurora; and since\r\nthe light of the latter, however mobile, varied, and, from time to\r\ntime, increased and diminished in itself, is yet, as to general\r\neffect, continuous and [p420] steady. There remains, then, but to\r\ncompare the phenomenon of the Aurora with the rising or the setting\r\nSun. In both of these latter, as in the Aurora, the light is in\r\nthe horizon, and that light is shot upward, perpendicularly, or\r\nobliquely, toward the zenith or toward the right and left; and both\r\nof these, like the Aurora, are more or less constantly attended with\r\na variety of colouring, similar in hue if not in depth, and always\r\nbeautiful, and often gorgeous. With the _Sun_, and with the beams\r\nof the Sun, ancient description, in point of fact, has confounded\r\nthe _Aurora Borealis_, to the degree, perhaps, of giving origin to\r\nsome of the ancient and poetical descriptions of the Sun, utterly\r\ninappropriate and inexplicable as understood of that day-star, but\r\neasily recognised in the Aurora; yet the dissimilitudes, at last, are\r\nnumerous and great! Of the essential difference of figure, both as to\r\nthe _beams_ of the Sun, and the _beams_ of the Aurora, in severalty,\r\nand of the inevitable difference of indication of which, as to their\r\nnature, mention has been already made; and also as to the general\r\nor collective figure of the beams of the Aurora, as contrasted with\r\nthat of the rising, or of the setting Sun. The next point is the\r\nhomogeneity of colour in the beams of the Sun, however the apparent\r\ncolour may vary, as it is seen to do, from horizontal stratum to\r\nhorizontal stratum, from the horizon to the zenith, according to the\r\nvaried density of the medium between the light and the eye of the\r\nspectator. The light, upon the other hand, of the beams of the Aurora\r\nis heterogeneously coloured in itself, and is so displayed; and\r\nnot, therefore, varied as the beams ascend from horizontal stratum\r\nto horizontal stratum, or as crossing all the beams together, but\r\nfound in each particular beam itself, and attending its direction,\r\nwhether vertical or inclined, and whether rectilinear or curved.\r\nWaiving, then, any comparison in detail, between the phenomena of\r\nthe Aurora, and the phenomena of the rising or of the setting Sun,\r\nbut admitting that, to a certain degree, all are alike vast in\r\ndimensions, splendid in light, rich in colour, and durable upon the\r\neye; there is still nothing else to be subjoined, than that, at least\r\nwith reference to vastness of dimension and magnitude of the volume\r\nof light; to the quantity of light diffused; and to the richness and\r\ngorgeousness of [p421] the attendant colouring; there can be little\r\nrisk, in the assertion that, vast, and splendid, and beautiful, and\r\nrich, and gorgeous, as, when seen in the most favourable situation,\r\nand under the most favourable circumstances, the Aurora may be, it\r\nis, at last, but insignificant, when compared, for those features,\r\nto the vastness, the splendour, the beauty, the richness, and the\r\ngorgeousness, more or less, from day to day, displayed in the rising\r\nor the setting of the Sun; and, that for chaster beauty, and even for\r\namount of light diffused, it is not even to be likened to the silver\r\nMoon! As a substitute, too, for either, or for both, the Aurora, in\r\nthe regions of cold and night, may justly demand the admiration and\r\nthe blessing of mankind; and, in regions cold and inclement, its\r\nrarity, not unaccompanied by beauty, by grandeur, and sometimes even\r\nby the terrible in appearance, may well invite the gaze and fix the\r\nattention of beholders; but, considered along with the light of the\r\nluminaries of heaven, its claims reduce themselves in quality, though\r\ncertainly not in degree, to a level with those of an artificial\r\nlustre; and we almost repeat, in reference to the light of the\r\nAurora, as compared with that of the Sun, or even of the Moon, what\r\nthe poet has said in reference to the lights of our chambers:—\r\n\r\n                  “Who but rather turns\r\n To heaven’s broad beam his unconstrained eye,\r\n Than to the glimmering of a waxen flame?”\r\n\r\nThe Moon, in the meantime, inferior as she is to the Sun, has\r\nbeen “blessed,” from age to age, for her “useful light;” and the\r\n“useful light” of the Aurora, also, has its claims to “blessing.” It\r\nco-operates with the Sun, the Moon, and with other agents of nature,\r\nto make, not merely the Polar regions of the earth, but the entire\r\nglobe of the earth, fruitful, at once, and habitable[127]! [p422]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXII. In a succeeding paper, the author may possibly submit to the\r\nconsideration of his reader, the particular and novel hypotheses\r\nwhich he has allowed himself to form, as to the _substance_,\r\n_causes_, and _effects_ of the Aurora; hypotheses partly dependent\r\nupon those _facts in its natural history_, which, above, have been\r\nalmost the exclusive objects of attention. At present, the leading\r\nparticulars of the _natural history_ of the phenomenon, which it has\r\nbeen attempted either to bring or to fix in view, are these:\r\n\r\n1. That the Aurora is a phenomenon observed both in the Northern and\r\nSouthern Hemispheres.\r\n\r\n2. That, in either hemisphere, it is observed in the general\r\ndirection of the corresponding _pole of the earth_.\r\n\r\n3. That, in the Northern Hemisphere, on the shores of the Icy Sea, or\r\nat the furthest distance north, its situation is still observed to be\r\nthe northward.\r\n\r\n4. That, in the Southern Hemisphere, it has been observed to the east\r\nof the South Pole, and in the Northern, to the east and west of the\r\nNorth Pole.\r\n\r\n5. That, upon the late occasion, the place of its columns, during the\r\nexhibition, was observed to change from the west of north to the east\r\nof north; but, so as always to have the north for the apparent centre\r\nof its strength.\r\n\r\n6. That, in the Arctic regions, the appearance of the Aurora is said\r\nto be usually followed by clear and calm weather.\r\n\r\n7. That the appearance of the Aurora Borealis is no wise peculiar\r\nto the winter solstice, but has been observed in each of the eight\r\nmonths of September, October, November, December, January, February,\r\nMarch, and April, and may be regarded, therefore, as coincident\r\nwith the Arctic winter; and that the appearance of an Aurora in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere, in the month of February, or beginning of the\r\nAntarctic winter, as observed during the voyage of Captain Cook, in\r\nthe year 1773, is [p423] consistent with the persuasion, that the\r\nAurora _Australis_, in its turn, is a phenomenon of the Austral or\r\nAntarctic winter.\r\n\r\n8. That _considerable_ or powerful displays of the Aurora are\r\ninfrequent, even in the extreme Polar regions; and that it is _very\r\nconsiderable_ or powerful displays alone, which make themselves\r\nvisible in the lower latitudes, north or south of the equator.\r\n\r\n9. That no appearance belongs to the Aurora itself, but that of its\r\ncoruscations, columns, spears, or streamers; and that all colours,\r\ntherefore, or coloured figures, not belonging to the coruscations,\r\nbut coincident in their appearance, are to be regarded only as\r\nreflections or refractions of light, derived from the coruscations by\r\nthe clouds which happen to cover the sky.\r\n\r\n10. That the colours, or coloured light, proper to the Aurora, or\r\nseen in the columns or coruscations themselves, are varied from\r\ncolumn or coruscation to column or coruscation, and severally\r\ncontinued in the direction, and throughout the length or height, of\r\neach.\r\n\r\n11. That, in the late example, the columns or coruscations situate\r\nin the due north, or apparent centre or focus of the phenomenon,\r\nexhibited a light at least comparatively white; and that the\r\nvariation, from white to colour, had an apparent relation to the\r\ncomparative remoteness of each column or coruscation from the column\r\nor coruscation in the central north.\r\n\r\n12. That the direction or position of the columns or coruscations of\r\nthe Aurora, are so far from being uniformly convergent toward the\r\nzenith, or uniformly vertical, or from the horizon to the zenith,\r\nthat, in the late example, they _did not converge_ toward the zenith,\r\nbut, contrariwise, _diverged_ from it; spreading themselves like the\r\nsticks of a fan, or like stalks in a flower-basket.\r\n\r\n13. That the columns or coruscations of the Aurora are not uniformly\r\nrectilinear in their figure; but that, in the late example, those\r\non the north-eastward were curved outwardly, or “bent sideways,” as\r\ndescribed in the appearance of the columns or coruscations of an\r\nAurora seen in the Southern Atlantic, during the voyage of Captain\r\nCook, in the year 1773.

Art. Aurora Borealis.\r\n\r\n [125] Encyclopædia Britannica.\r\n\r\n [126] The individual, social, and political importance of making\r\n the _art of drawing_ a branch of general education, is a subject\r\n which the author can never cease to urge upon the attention of his\r\n fellow-countrymen, and of all the civilised world. It is more than\r\n ten years since he first endeavoured to lead the public eye to its\r\n regard. In England, and with a view to the subsistence of a large\r\n and always increasing population, it is an EDUCATION IN THE ARTS\r\n which is the great want; and the _art of drawing_, besides being\r\n the assistant of all _knowledge_ whatever, is peculiarly so of all\r\n other _arts_ than itself, or of all other works of the _hand_. A\r\n recent Sermon, by the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, preached at\r\n Wells, for the benefit of the Diocesan National Schools, bears ample\r\n testimony to the deficiency, and even the dangers, to the poor not\r\n less than to others, in all the present popular education; and, so\r\n far, therefore, to the soundness of the author’s principles, and\r\n to the fitness of his remedy. His own design, however, is not only\r\n to remedy an evil arising from the present practice, but also to\r\n produce an independent good; and, not merely to aid the poor, nor\r\n merely to promote the political welfare of this kingdom, but to\r\n increase the resources, physical and intellectual, of all classes,\r\n and to promote the welfare of the whole world.\r\n\r\n [127] The author has an opinion, that among the “agents of nature,”\r\n for equalising the temperature of the surface of the globe, is to\r\n be reckoned, not only the Northern and Southern Lights, but the\r\n entire Ocean; and that this agency is the immediate object aimed at\r\n in the existence of this last, as one body of water surrounding the\r\n entire globe. His evidence consists in geographical, hydrographical,\r\n meteorological, and physiological facts, as also in the apparent\r\n reason of the case. He supposes, in consequence, a perpetual\r\n circulation of the waters of the sea, longitudinally round the\r\n globe, or from North to South, and from South to North again; and\r\n the result of Captain Parry’s late attempt to reach the Arctic\r\n Pole, as also some of the facts which have transpired respecting\r\n Captain Franklin’s late land expedition, appear to confirm his\r\n theory, according to which the physical use, or final cause, of\r\n the existence of the Ocean has never previously been understood.\r\n His theory affects the question of the North-west Passage, which\r\n latter object he suspects to have never yet been pursued in the true\r\n direction; even the discoveries of Captain Parry appearing to him to\r\n have fallen short of ascertaining the communication with the Polar\r\n Sea by the channel of Davis’s Strait.—Some introductory observations\r\n upon this subject have been already made in an article in the New\r\n Monthly Magazine for October, 1826, (vol. xvii. p. 371.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Proceedings of the Royal Society_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anniversary meeting of the Royal Society for the election of a\r\npresident, and other officers, was held as usual at Somerset House,\r\non Thursday, the 30th of November, being St. Andrew’s day.\r\n\r\nTill within a few days of the election, it was generally understood\r\nthat the Rt. Hon. Robert Peel was a candidate for the chair; in\r\nconsequence, however, of that gentleman having declined, Davies\r\nGilbert, Esq., M.P., was put in nomination, and was almost\r\nunanimously elected the President of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThe late secretaries, Messrs. Herschel and Children, having resigned\r\ntheir respective offices, Dr. Roget and Captain Sabine were nominated\r\nin their places, and were duly elected.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Mr. Gilbert to the chair having rendered vacant the\r\noffice of Treasurer, Major Kater was elected in his place.\r\n\r\nThe following council was elected, to continue in office until St.\r\nAndrew’s day, 1828.\r\n\r\n Davies Gilbert, Esq.\r\n Major Kater.\r\n Dr. Roget, M.D.\r\n Captain Sabine, R.A.\r\n Dr. Wollaston, M.D.\r\n Dr. Fitton, M.D.\r\n Dr. Young, M.D.\r\n Dr. Paris, M.D.\r\n Dr. Prout, M.D.\r\n Dr. Goodenough, D.D.\r\n Dr. Buckland, D.D.\r\n J.

Beaufort, R.N.\r\n Francis Baily, Esq.\r\n John Guillemard, Esq.\r\n\r\n[p425]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of having been elected President _pro tempore_ by the\r\ncouncil, (the chair having been vacated some weeks previous to the\r\ngeneral election,) the duties of the office were performed by Mr.\r\nGilbert, on occasion of the present anniversary. After having read\r\nover the list of members admitted, and of those deceased during the\r\nlast year, he proceeded to announce the disposal of the Royal and\r\nCopley Medals, as awarded by the votes of the council.\r\n\r\nOf the Royal Medals, one was awarded to Sir H. Davy, and the other to\r\nProfessor Struve. Of the Copley Medals, one was given to Dr. Prout,\r\nand another to Lieutenant Forster. On this occasion Mr. Gilbert\r\npronounced an eulogium upon the respective receivers of the medals;\r\nand, in adverting to the labours of the several individuals, he\r\njustified the decision of the council, in bestowing upon them these\r\nmarks of distinction, in a learned and eloquent discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Proceedings of the Horticultural Society_.\r\n\r\n\r\n _September_ 4th.\r\n\r\nA paper by Mr. Lindley was read upon the new hardy plants which had\r\nflowered in the Society’s garden; among them a number of new shrubs\r\nwere mentioned, which appeared likely to prove acquisitions to the\r\npublic. A thermometer was exhibited by Mr. Bregazzi, of Derby,\r\nfor ascertaining the temperature of bark-beds. It consisted of a\r\nthermometer enclosed in a shaft of copper with a wooden handle, and\r\na door in its side, by which the temperature can be ascertained with\r\nprecision. It is needless to point out the superiority of this plan,\r\nover the common mode of determining this very essential point, by\r\nfeeling of a stick previously stuck in the bed; the sensation of heat\r\nwhen the stick is grasped in the hand will obviously depend in a\r\ngreat degree upon the temperature of the hand itself. As usual, there\r\nwas an extensive display of all the choicest flowers and fruit of the\r\nseason. One hundred and seventy-two subjects of this description were\r\nplaced upon the table. Among the flowers, the most remarkable was\r\na new hardy climber from Mexico, with deep purple blossoms studded\r\n[p426] with glittering green glands, called Maurandya Barclaiana;\r\namong the fruit was a fine specimen, from Lord Grantham’s garden, of\r\nthe Papaw, a tropical fruit never ripened in England before.\r\n\r\n\r\n _September_ 18th.\r\n\r\nThe exhibitions of this day were chiefly confined to a display of\r\nDahlias, which for magnificence exceeded any thing of the kind we\r\never witnessed before. The large meeting-room was filled with masses\r\nof the richest and most lively colours. In the whole, eight hundred\r\nand fifty-one varieties were shown, among which the finest were from\r\nthe garden of William Wells, Esq., of Redleaf; but where all are so\r\nexcellent, it is almost invidious to particularize. The time will\r\nbe remembered by many of our readers when gardens in the autumn\r\ncontained little besides marigolds, sun-flowers, and sweet-peas; by\r\nthe aid of dahlias and chrysanthemums the autumn has now become the\r\nliveliest season of the year, and the beauty of the flower-garden\r\nis only destroyed by the severest of the winter frosts. Among the\r\ngrapes upon the table was a remarkably excellent yellow-berried kind,\r\nfrom Portugal, from the garden of Mr. Holford, of Hampstead, which\r\nwas quite new to this country. Apples, nectarines, peaches, and\r\npine-apples abounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n _October_ 2nd.\r\n\r\nAmong the flowers was a fine bunch of ranunculuses, from Mr. Groom,\r\nof Walworth, a rare sight in October; they were obtained by having\r\nbeen planted in July and carefully protected by tulip-shades when\r\ncoming into flower. The season for softer fruits being nearly over,\r\npears and apples formed the chief display; of these a vast number,\r\nupwards of one hundred and eighty of the latter, were upon the\r\ntable: the Blenheim orange, or Woodstock pippin, pomme gris, scarlet\r\nnonpareil, courtpendu plat, golden reinette, and packhorse apples;\r\nand Chapman’s, Marie Louise, and brown beurré pears, appeared to\r\nus to excel all their rivals. The famous gloux morceau and beurré\r\nd’Aremberg pears were also exhibited, but were not ripe. [p427]\r\n\r\n\r\n _October_ 16th.\r\n\r\nThe first number of a new periodical work, called the _Pomological\r\nMagazine_, consisting of coloured figures of the fruits cultivated\r\nin Great Britain, was placed upon the table. Among the apples were\r\nspecimens of a variety sent from England to Connecticut, in the year\r\n1636, and reimported from America within a few years. It proved to\r\nbe a kind not known at the present day in this country, but still\r\ncultivated in France. In the gardening books of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries it is mentioned under the name of the haute\r\nbonté. The specimens exhibited served to disprove the opinion that\r\nmany of the American apples are European kinds altered by climate;\r\nthese, although the produce of trees which have been growing in\r\nAmerica for nearly two hundred years, differed in no respect from\r\nFrench samples exhibited at a subsequent meeting of the Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n _November_ 6th.\r\n\r\nAn excellent paper was read upon the method of cultivating horse\r\nradish, in Denmark. The roots are cut into slips, and planted\r\n_horizontally_, the lower end inclining a little upwards, and the\r\ncrown of the plant hanging over the alleys, by which the beds are\r\nseparated. From time to time the roots are uncovered, and all the\r\n_lateral_ fibres are carefully removed, by which the size and length\r\nof the roots are much increased. The place hitherto occupied by\r\ndahlias, was now taken by Chinese chrysanthemums, of which a large\r\nnumber, consisting of twenty-two different varieties, was exhibited\r\nat the bottom of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n _November_ 20th.\r\n\r\nCuttings of the fine new Portugal grape, of which fruit was exhibited\r\non the 18th of September, were distributed to the members present.\r\nA few dahlia flowers still showed themselves, notwithstanding the\r\nunusual severity of some early frosts, and the room was crowded with\r\nchrysanthemums. The gloux morceau and beurré d’Aremberg pears were\r\ntasted, and found to retain the station which has been assigned to\r\nthem at the head of all known varieties.

The opposition to the sun will be 1828, Oct. 12.34: while its light\r\n is weak, it may be observed on or near the meridian.\r\n\r\n On the 10th of Nov. 1828, its distance from the sun will be the same\r\n as at the time of its discovery in 1818, and it will be considerably\r\n nearer to the earth; and on the 21st of December, its position with\r\n respect to the sun will be the same as at its last observation\r\n in 1819; and with respect to earth, its situation will be more\r\n advantageous. The 1st of January, 1829, it will set with the sun.\r\n\r\n It follows, that the most advantageous time for seeing it will be\r\n during the whole of November, and the first 25 days of December.\r\n It will scarcely be seen before the end of September, as it has\r\n heretofore never been observed more than two months before the time\r\n of its perihelion, and even in the dark winter nights will scarcely\r\n be visible more than 14 or 15 weeks before that period. After the\r\n perihelion it will not be visible in these parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n ii. _Elementary View of the_ UNDULATORY _Theory of Light_. _By_ Mr.\r\n FRESNEL.\r\n\r\n [Continued from the last Number.]\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the explanation of the conditions necessary for\r\nthe formation of the fringes, it remains to show why a small luminous\r\npoint must be employed in experiments on diffraction, and not an\r\nobject of any considerable dimensions. If we resume the case of the\r\ninterior fringes of the shadow of [p432] a narrow body, it will be\r\neasy to apply similar arguments to other cases of diffraction.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the central band, which is always formed by the\r\nsimultaneous arrival of rays, which depart at the same instant from\r\nthe luminous point, must be found in the plane drawn through this\r\npoint, and the line bisecting the narrow body: because, since every\r\nthing is symmetrical on each side of this plane, the rays which unite\r\nin it must have passed through equal routes on each side, and must\r\nconsequently arrive at the same instant, unless they have passed\r\nthrough different media, which is not the case to be considered at\r\npresent. The situation of the middle stripe being determined, that\r\nof every other stripe must also be determined accordingly. Now it\r\nis evident that if the luminous point should change its situation a\r\nlittle, and be moved to the right, for example, the plane, which has\r\nbeen supposed, would incline to the left, and would carry with it all\r\nthe fringes which accompany the middle stripe. And if, instead of\r\nsupposing motion, we suppose the luminous point to become of sensible\r\ndimensions; the integral points of which it is composed will each\r\nproduce a group of fringes, and their situations will be so much the\r\nmore remote as the luminous object is larger; and ultimately, if its\r\nsize is sufficiently increased, they will extinguish each other and\r\ndisappear. This is the reason that, when the rays cross each other at\r\nsensible angles, as in all the phenomena of diffraction, it becomes\r\nnecessary to employ a very fine luminous point, in order to discover\r\ntheir mutual influence: and the point must be so much the finer as\r\nthe angle formed by the rays is greater.\r\n\r\nHowever minute the luminous point may be, it is always composed, in\r\nreality, of an infinite number of centres of oscillations, and it is\r\nof each of these centres that we must understand what has been said\r\nof a luminous point. But as long as they are very near to each other\r\nin comparison with the breadth of the fringes, it is obvious that the\r\ndifferent groups of fringes which they produce, instead of mixing\r\nwith each other in a confused manner, will be superposed almost\r\nexactly, and instead of extinguishing, will co-operate with each\r\nother. [p433]\r\n\r\nWhen the two systems of waves which interfere are parallel, the\r\ninterval which separates their corresponding points must remain the\r\nsame for a great portion of the _surface of the waves_, that is to\r\nsay, in other words, the fringes will become almost infinite in\r\nbreadth, so that a very considerable displacement of the centre of\r\nundulation will cause very little difference in the agreement or\r\ndisagreement of their vibrations. And in this case it is no longer\r\nnecessary to employ so small an object in order to perceive the\r\neffects of their mutual influence.\r\n\r\nIf the coloured rings, which are produced by the interference of two\r\nsystems of undulations nearly parallel, exhibit, like the fringes,\r\nand often within a very short distance, alternations of dark and\r\nbright stripes; this circumstance depends entirely on the want of\r\nuniformity in the thickness of the plate of air interposed between\r\nthe glasses, which causes a variation of the difference of the routes\r\nof the rays reflected at the first and at the second surface of this\r\nplate, of which the mutual interference produces the bright and dark\r\nrings.\r\n\r\nWe shall readily be able, to understand why the luminous rays,\r\nalthough they always exert a certain influence on each other, exhibit\r\nit to the eye so seldom, and in cases so much limited, if we consider\r\nthat it is necessary, for such an exhibition, first, that the rays\r\nconcerned shall have been derived from a common source; secondly,\r\nthat the difference between their paths shall amount to a limited\r\nnumber of undulations only, even when the light is as homogeneous\r\nas possible; thirdly, that they shall not intersect each other at\r\ntoo great an angle, because the fringes would become so small as to\r\nbe invisible even with the assistance of a strong magnifier; and\r\nfourthly, unless the rays are nearly parallel, that the luminous\r\nobject should be of very small dimensions, and the smaller in\r\nproportion as the inclination of the rays is greater.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought necessary to insist so much at length on the\r\ntheory of interferences, because of its numerous applications to the\r\ncalculation of the most interesting of the laws of optical phenomena.\r\nThese considerations may perhaps appear at first somewhat delicate\r\nand difficult of comprehension, notwithstanding the minuteness of the\r\n[p434] explanation; but with some reflection it will be found that\r\nnothing can be simpler than the principles on which they are founded,\r\nand their application will soon become familiar to the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the bases of the general theory of diffraction,\r\nit remains for us to consider the principle of Huygens, which appears\r\nto be a rigorous consequence of the system of undulations.\r\n\r\nThe principle may be thus expressed: _The vibrations of a luminous\r\nundulation, in each of its points, may be regarded as the result of\r\nthe elementary motions which would be transmitted to that point, at\r\nthe same instant, from all the points of the undulation, considered\r\nseparately, as they existed in any one of its earlier situations_.\r\n\r\nIt is a consequence of the principle of the co-existence of small\r\nmotions, that the vibrations, produced at any point of an elastic\r\nfluid, by several agitations, are represented by the result of all\r\nthe velocities belonging to that point at the same instant, as\r\nderived from the different centres of the undulations, combined\r\naccording to the laws of motion, whatever may be the number and\r\nsituation of the centres, and whatever the periods and nature of the\r\nundulations. This general principle is applicable to every particular\r\ncase. We may suppose the agitations infinite in number, of the same\r\nkind, simultaneous, and taking place in contiguous points of a\r\nplane or a spherical surface: it will also be convenient to suppose\r\nthe motions of the particles to take place in the same direction,\r\nperpendicular to the surface, their velocity being proportional to\r\nthe condensation of the medium, and none of them retrograde in their\r\ndirection. In this manner a derivative undulation will be produced by\r\nthe union of these agitations, and the principle of Huygens may be\r\ntruly applied to such a propagation. [This may be called a rigorous\r\nconsequence of the system, but it can scarcely be considered as a\r\nproposition mathematically demonstrated: and the fundamental law of\r\nHuygens must perhaps be assumed as an axiom or a phenomenon. TR.]\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the primitive undulation being uniform\r\nthroughout the surface, it results from this “theoretical” [p435]\r\nconsideration, as well as from other reasoning, that the uniformity\r\nwill be preserved throughout the progress of the undulation, unless\r\nany part of it be intercepted or retarded; because the result of the\r\nelementary motions, which have been mentioned, will be the same for\r\nall the points. But if a portion of the undulation be intercepted\r\nby the interposition of an opaque body, then the intensity of each\r\npart will vary according to the distance from the margin of the\r\nshadow, and these variations will be particularly sensible in the\r\nneighbourhood of the tangent rays.\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet C be the luminous point, AG the screen, and AME the wave, arrived\r\nat A, and partly intercepted by the opaque body. We may suppose it\r\nto be divided into an infinite number of small arcs, A_m′_, _m′__m_,\r\n_m_M, M_n″_, _n″__n′_, _n′__n_, and so forth. In order to find its\r\nintensity at the point P, belonging to any subsequent situation of\r\nthe undulation, BPD, we must find the result of all the elementary\r\nagitations which each of these portions of the primitive undulation\r\nwould produce there if they acted separately.\r\n\r\nThe impulse, which has been given to every part of the [p436]\r\nprimitive undulation, being perpendicular to its surface, the\r\nmotions of the particles of ether in this direction must be more\r\nconsiderable than in any other; and the rays depending on these\r\nmotions, if separately considered, would be so much the weaker as\r\nthey deviated the more from this direction.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the law by which their intensity would be\r\ngoverned, according to their direction, as derived from any\r\nseparate centre of agitation, would certainly be of very difficult\r\ninvestigation: but happily we are not obliged to determine this law,\r\nfor it is easy to see that when the inclination to the perpendicular\r\nis considerable, the effects of the different rays must very nearly\r\ndestroy each other: so that these rays, which sensibly affect the\r\nquantity of light received at each point P, may safely be regarded as\r\nbeing equal in intensity.\r\n\r\nWhen the centre of agitation has undergone a condensation, the\r\nexpansive force tends to urge the molecules in every direction; and\r\nif they do not perform a retrograde motion, it is only because their\r\ninitial velocities forwards destroy those which the expansion of the\r\ncondensed fluid would otherwise generate backwards: but it does not\r\nfollow from this that the agitation can only be propagated in the\r\ndirection of the initial velocities; for the expansive force in a\r\nperpendicular direction, for example, will combine with the primitive\r\nimpulse without any diminution of its effects. It is obvious that\r\nthe intensity of the undulation thus produced may vary much at the\r\ndifferent points of its circumference, not only from the nature of\r\nthe initial impulse, but also because the condensations are not\r\nsubject to the same law on every side of the centre of the agitated\r\npart[?]. But the variations of the intensity of the derivative\r\nundulation must necessarily be subjected to a law of continuity, and\r\nmay consequently be considered as insensible in a very small angular\r\ninterval, especially in the neighbourhood of the perpendicular to the\r\nsurface of the primitive undulation; for the initial velocities of\r\nthe molecules, referred to any given direction, being proportional\r\nto the cosines of the angles made by that direction with the\r\nperpendicular, these results vary much [p437] more slowly than the\r\nangles themselves, while they remain inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nIf, in fact, we consider rays sensibly inclined to each other,\r\nsuch as EP, FP, IP, meeting in the point P, which we may suppose\r\nat the distance of a great number of breadths from the undulation\r\nEA: and if we take two arcs, EF and FI, of such a length that the\r\ndifferences EP−FP and FP−IP may be equal to half an undulation: on\r\naccount of the marked obliquity of the rays, and of the smallness of\r\na semiundulation, in proportion to their length, these two arcs will\r\nbe almost equal, and the rays which come from them to the point P\r\nwill be nearly parallel; so that on account of the difference of a\r\nsemiundulation between the corresponding rays of the two arcs, their\r\neffects will mutually destroy each other.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore suppose all the rays sent by the different parts\r\nof the undulation at AE, to the point P, to be of equal intensity,\r\nsince the only rays, with respect to which this hypothesis would be\r\nincorrect, are such as have no sensible influence on the quantity of\r\nlight which it receives. For the same reason, in order to simplify\r\nthe calculation of the result of all these elementary undulations,\r\nwe may consider their constituent motions as performed in the\r\nsame direction, the angles which they form with each other being\r\ninconsiderable. The problem is thus reduced to that which has been\r\nsolved in the Memoir on Diffraction, already quoted: _To find the\r\nresult of any number of systems of parallel undulations of light, of\r\nthe same frequency, when their intensities and relative situations\r\nare given_.—The intensities are here proportional to the length of\r\nthe small illuminating arcs, and the relative situations are given\r\nfrom the differences of the paths described.\r\n\r\nWe have considered, correctly speaking, only the section of the\r\nundulation made by a plane perpendicular to the margin of the screen\r\nrepresented by A. We may now take into account the whole extent\r\nof the undulation, and suppose it to be divided, by equidistant\r\nmeridians perpendicular to the plane of the figure, into infinitely\r\nthin wedges or strata; and we may apply to all of these the reasoning\r\nwhich has [p438] been employed for one section, and thus demonstrate\r\nthat the rays which have a marked obliquity must destroy each other.\r\n\r\nThese strata, in the case here considered, being all parallel to the\r\nedge of the screen, and infinitely extended, while the undulation\r\nis intercepted but on one side; the intensity of the result of all\r\nthe impressions, which they transmit to P, will be the same for each\r\nof them: for the rays emanating from them must be considered as of\r\nequal intensity, at least for the very small extent of the generating\r\nundulation, which has a sensible influence on the light received at\r\nP. Besides, each elementary result will evidently be retarded by the\r\nsame quantity, with respect to the ray derived from the point of the\r\nstratum nearest to P, that is to say, to the point in which it cuts\r\nthe plane of the figure: consequently the intervals between these\r\nelementary results will be equal to the differences of the paths\r\ndescribed by the rays AP, _m′_P, _m_P, and so forth, which are in\r\nthe plane of the figure, and their intensities will be proportional\r\nto the arcs A_m′_, _m′_, _m_, _m_M, and so forth. We may therefore\r\nconsider the intensity of the general result as determined by the\r\ncalculation already mentioned, as belonging to the section of the\r\nundulation made by a plane perpendicular to the margin of the screen.\r\n\r\nWhile the outline of the screen remains rectilinear, it is\r\nsufficient, in order to determine the situations of the dark and\r\nlight stripes, and their relative intensities, to consider the\r\nsection of the undulation made by a plane perpendicular to that\r\noutline: but when it is curved, or composed of lines meeting at any\r\nangles, it becomes necessary to obtain the integral effect for two\r\ndirections at right angles to each other, or for a circle surrounding\r\nthe point considered. This last method is the most simple in some\r\nparticular cases, as when we have to calculate, for example, the\r\nintensity of the light in the projection of the centre of a circular\r\nscreen or opening: [a simplification which, though sufficiently\r\nobvious, had perhaps not occurred to Mr. FRESNEL, until it was\r\npointed out to him by the Translator of this paper.]\r\n\r\nIt will now be easy to form a distinct idea of the method [p439]\r\nwhich must be followed, in order to calculate the situation and\r\nthe intensity of the dark and bright stripes, in the different\r\ncircumstances under which it is proposed to compare the theory with\r\nexperiment. When the screen is infinitely extended on one side, or\r\nis broad enough to allow us to neglect the rays which pass beyond\r\nit, we are to determine, for any point P at the distance of the\r\nplace at which the fringes are to be observed, the result of all\r\nthe elementary undulations coming from the part AMF only of the\r\nincident wave; and comparing the intensities at different collateral\r\npoints, P, P′, P″, we are to find the situation of the darkest and\r\nthe brightest points. In this manner we find, for a screen closed\r\non one side, 1st, that the intensity of the light decreases rapidly\r\nwithin the [shadow] beginning from the tangent CAB, and _so much the\r\nmore rapidly as the undulation is smaller_; and this in a continuous\r\nmanner, without any alternations of maxima and minima; 2ndly, that\r\nout of the shadow, the intensity of the light, after augmenting\r\nconsiderably to a certain point, which may be called a maximum of\r\nthe first order, decreases to another point, which is the minimum\r\nof the first order: that it increases again to a second maximum, to\r\nwhich succeeds a second minimum, and so forth; 3rdly, that none of\r\nthese minimums completely vanish, as in the case of fringes produced\r\nby the concourse of two luminous pencils of equal intensity, and\r\nthat the difference between the maxima and minima diminishes in\r\nproportion as we go further from the shadow; whence we may understand\r\nwhy the fringes which surround shadows in a homogeneous light, are\r\nless marked and less numerous, than those which are obtained by\r\na combination of two mirrors, and those in white light much less\r\nbrilliant; 4thly, that the intervals been the maxima and minima are\r\nunequal, and diminish, as we depart from the shadow, in proportions\r\nwhich remain unaltered, whatever may be the distance from the screen\r\nat which we measure them; and 5thly, that the same maxima and minima,\r\ncalculated for different distances from the screen, are situated in\r\nhyperbolas of a sensible curvature, of which the foci are the edge\r\nof the screen, and the luminous point. All these consequences of the\r\ntheory are precisely confirmed by experiment. [p440]\r\n\r\nThe general formula gives the position of the maxima and minima for\r\nany distances whatever of the luminous point from the screen, and\r\nfrom the screen to the micrometer, when the length of the undulation\r\nof the light employed is known. In order to submit the theory to a\r\ndecisive test, instead of determining the length of the undulation\r\nby measures of the external fringes, and then employing it in\r\ncalculations of the same kind, I deduced it from an experiment on\r\ndiffraction of a very different kind; and after having first verified\r\nit by the fringes obtained from two mirrors, of which it represented\r\nthe breadth within a hundredth part of the truth, I introduced it\r\ninto the formula which I afterwards compared with 125 measurements of\r\nexterior fringes, made under very different circumstances; for the\r\ndistance of the radiant point from the screen was varied from four\r\ninches to six or seven yards, and the distance between the screen\r\nand the micrometer was varied from 1/13th of an inch to more than\r\nfour yards: and the results of all these comparisons were perfectly\r\nsatisfactory, as maybe seen in the comparative table published in the\r\nXIth volume of the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, p. 339, 343.\r\n\r\nWhen the screen, instead of extending infinitely on one side, is\r\nnarrow enough to admit some light on that side, not too much weakened\r\nby the rapid decrease of intensity produced by obliquity, we must\r\ntake into the calculation the light on both sides, and find, for\r\neach point of the shadow, the general result of all the elementary\r\nundulations derived from the points on the right and left. We thus\r\ndemonstrate that the interior parts of the shadow must be divided\r\nby a series of dark and bright stripes, nearly equal in breadth,\r\nof which the situations differ very little from those which would\r\nbe deduced from the approximative formula which has already been\r\ngiven for the same purpose, when they are still separated from the\r\nborders of the shadow by an interval of several of their breadths.\r\nBut when the opaque body is narrow enough, and the micrometer far\r\nenough removed for the observed stripes to be very near the exterior\r\nstripes, then the results of this more exact calculation, as well\r\nas those of experiment, show that the approximation is no longer\r\naccurate. The [p441] calculation determines also, with remarkable\r\nprecision, the singular alterations which the exterior fringes often\r\nundergo, when the other series extends beyond the shadow, and mixes\r\nits effects with those of the exterior.\r\n\r\nI have also verified the theory by examining the fringes derived\r\nfrom a narrow slit of indefinite length; and determining, for the\r\ndifferent points enlightened by the luminous pencil, the result of\r\nall the elementary undulations derived from the part of the primitive\r\nwave comprehended in the breadth of the slit; and I have found a\r\nsatisfactory agreement between the calculation and the observations,\r\neven when the fringes thus obtained afforded the most capricious and\r\napparently irregular appearances.\r\n\r\nIn this mode of considering the problems relating to diffraction, we\r\nhave not taken into the calculation the greater or less thickness of\r\nthe edges of the screen, but merely the extent of the primitive wave\r\nwhich is capable of sending elementary undulations to the points for\r\nwhich we are to find the intensity of illumination; and the opaque\r\nsubstance has no other effect than simply to intercept a part of the\r\nwave: for this reason the result is necessarily independent of the\r\nnature of the body, of its mass, and of the thickness of its edges.\r\nNevertheless, if the surface of the edges were very extensive, it\r\nwould be impossible to consider the portion of the wave as quitting\r\nthe slit without having received some previous modification, and it\r\nwould be necessary to take into the calculation the small fringes\r\nderived from the effect of the remoter parts of the slit. But\r\nwhile the thickness is moderate, or the edges rounded off into a\r\nwell marked curve, the small fringes derived from this cause may\r\nbe neglected, and the emerging wave may be considered as of equal\r\nintensity throughout, at the moment of its quitting the screen,\r\nespecially if the intensity of the light is to be calculated for a\r\npretty considerable distance from the screen. We must not, indeed,\r\nforget, that according to the reasoning which has been employed,\r\nthe formulas for diffraction are only sufficiently exact when this\r\ndistance is very considerable, in comparison with the breadth of an\r\nundulation, since it is in this case only that we can neglect the\r\nrays that are decidedly oblique, and [p442] can suppose all those,\r\nwhich are essentially concerned in the effect, to be nearly of equal\r\nintensity. It is not, however, surprising that the same formulas will\r\ngive the position of the fringes with sufficient accuracy at small\r\ndistances from the screen, when its edges are thin, since, the mean\r\nbreadth of an undulation being but about one fifty thousandth of an\r\ninch, a tenth of an inch becomes comparatively a very considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThese are the three principal kinds of phenomena presented to us by\r\ndiffraction, when the edges of the screen, or of the opening made in\r\nit, are sufficiently extensive to afford fringes independent of any\r\neffect from their terminations: and in such cases it is sufficient\r\nto make the integral calculation for the plane perpendicular to\r\nthe edges of the screen only, in order to determine the position\r\nof the dark and bright stripes, and their comparative intensities.\r\nBut when the screen or the opening are of small dimensions in every\r\ndirection, it becomes necessary to extend the integration to the\r\neffects produced in two perpendicular planes: and the results of the\r\ncalculation agree perfectly with observation, as will appear from two\r\ncurious instances.\r\n\r\nWhen the screen is circular, the calculation leads to this singular\r\nresult, that the centre of the shadow projected by it must be as\r\nmuch enlightened as if the screen were not in existence. It was Mr.\r\nPOISSON that first pointed out this consequence of my formulas,\r\nwhich I did not at first observe, though it is immediately deducible\r\nfrom the theory by very simple geometrical considerations. Mr. ARAGO\r\nmade the experiment with the shadow of a screen 1/13th of an inch\r\nin diameter, perfectly round, and fixed on a plate of glass. The\r\nresult confirmed the fact which had been announced by the theory.\r\nIt is only the centre itself that possesses this property, and the\r\nsame brightness is only extended to a sensible distance from this\r\nmathematical point when the screen is of very small diameter, and\r\nwhen its shadow is observed at a great distance: for the wider that\r\nthe screen becomes, the more the little bright circle is contracted;\r\nand when the screen is four tenths of an inch in diameter, we only\r\nsee a single point of light, at the distance of a yard, even with a\r\npowerful magnifier. It must be observed, that if the screen [p443]\r\nwere too large, the reasoning, from which the formulas have been\r\ndeduced, would no longer be rigorously applicable to the rays\r\ninflected into the shadow, because of their too great obliquity,\r\nwhich would render it impossible to consider their effects as equal\r\nin intensity to those of the direct rays.\r\n\r\nWhen we calculate, by the same formulas, the intensity of the light\r\nin the centre of the projection of a small circular aperture, made\r\nin a large screen, we find that this centre will exhibit alternately\r\na bright and a dark appearance, according to the distance at which\r\nthe shadow is viewed; and that in homogeneous light this darkness\r\nmust be perfect. This new inference from the general formulas may be\r\ndeduced from the theory by very simple geometrical considerations.\r\nThus we find that the values of the successive distances, at\r\nwhich the centre of the shadow becomes completly dark, are _b_ =\r\n_a__r_^2/(2_a__d_−_r_^2), _b_ = _a__r_^2/(4_a__d_−_r_^2), _b_ =\r\n_a__r_^2/(8_a__d_−_r_^2); and so forth; _r_ being the semidiameter\r\nof the aperture, _a_ and _b_ its respective distances from the\r\nluminous point and from the micrometer, and _d_ the length of the\r\nundulation of the light employed. Now, if we place the micrometer at\r\nthe distances indicated by these formulas, we observe, in fact, that\r\nthe centre of the projection of the opening is so completely deprived\r\nof light, that it appears like a spot of ink in the middle of the\r\nilluminated part, at least with respect to the minimums of the first\r\nthree orders, as indicated by the formulas here inserted: those of\r\nthe subsequent orders, which are nearer to the screen, exhibiting\r\nno longer the same degree of darkness, on account of the want of\r\nhomogeneity of the light employed.\r\n\r\nThere is still a multitude of other phenomena of diffraction, such\r\nas those of multiplied and coloured images, reflected by striated\r\nsurfaces, as seen through a texture of fine fibres, as well as the\r\ncoloured rings, produced by an irregular collection of such fibres,\r\nor of light powders, consisting of particles nearly equal, placed\r\nbetween the eye of the spectator and a luminous object; all of which\r\nmay be explained and rigorously computed by means of the theory which\r\nhas been laid down. It would, however, occupy too much of our time\r\nto describe them here, and to [p444] show how exactly they concur\r\nin confirming the theory; which indeed appears to be abundantly\r\ndemonstrated by the numerous and diversified facts which have been\r\nalready adduced in support of it. It will be sufficient to conclude\r\nthis extract of the Memoir on Diffraction with a detailed description\r\nof an important experiment of Mr. ARAGO, which furnishes us with a\r\nmethod of determining the slightest differences of the refractive\r\npowers of bodies, with a degree of accuracy almost unlimited.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the fringes, produced by two very narrow slits, are\r\nalways placed symmetrically with regard to a plane passing through\r\nthe luminous point and the middle of the interval between the slits,\r\nas long as the two pencils of light which interfere have passed\r\nthrough the same medium, for instance, the air, as happens in the\r\nordinary arrangement of the apparatus. But the result is different\r\nwhen one of the pencils continues to pass through the air, and the\r\nother has to be transmitted by a more refractive body, a thin plate\r\nof mica, for example, or a piece of glass blown very thin: the\r\nfringes are then displaced, and carried towards the side on which\r\nthe transparent substance is placed: and if its thickness becomes\r\nat all considerable, they are removed out of the enlightened space,\r\nand disappear altogether. This important experiment, which was first\r\nmade by Mr. Arago, may also be performed with the apparatus of the\r\ntwo mirrors, if the plate be placed in the way of one of the pencils,\r\neither before or after its reflection.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what inference may be drawn from this remarkable fact,\r\nby the assistance of the principle of interferences. The light stripe\r\nin the middle is always derived, as we have already seen, from the\r\nsimultaneous arrival of rays which have issued at the same moment\r\nfrom the luminous point; consequently, in the common circumstances\r\nof the experiment, they must have described paths exactly equal, in\r\norder to arrive in the same time at the place of meeting: but it\r\nis obvious that if they pass through mediums in which light is not\r\npropagated with the same velocity, that pencil, which has travelled\r\nthe more slowly, will arrive at the given point later than the other,\r\nand the point will [p445] therefore no longer be in the bright\r\nstripe. The stripe must therefore necessarily change its place\r\ntowards the pencil which travels the more slowly, in order that\r\nthe shortness of its path may compensate for the delay during its\r\ntransmission through the solid: and the converse of the proposition\r\nenables us to conclude, that where the stripes are displaced, the\r\npencil towards which they move has been retarded in its passage. The\r\nnatural inference, therefore, “from Mr. ARAGO’s experiment,” is, that\r\nlight is propagated more rapidly in the air than in mica or glass,\r\nand generally in all bodies more refractive than the air; a result\r\ndirectly opposite to the Newtonian theory of refraction, which,\r\nsupposes the particles of light to be strongly attracted by dense\r\nsubstances, which would cause the velocity of light to be greater in\r\nthese bodies than in rarer mediums.\r\n\r\nThis experiment furnishes a method of comparing the velocity of the\r\npropagation of light in different mediums, [or, in other words,\r\nthe refractive density, which is always supposed in this theory,\r\nto be reciprocally proportional to it.] If, in fact, we measure\r\nvery accurately, by means of a spherometer, the thickness of the\r\nthin plate of glass which has been placed in the way of one of\r\nthe luminous pencils, and if the displacement of the fringes has\r\nbeen measured by the micrometer; since we know that, before the\r\ninterposition of the glass, the paths described were equal for the\r\nmiddle of the central stripe, we may calculate how much difference\r\nis occasioned by the change of position, and this difference will\r\ngive the retardation in the plate of glass, of which the thickness\r\nis known: so that, by adding this thickness to the difference\r\ncalculated, we shall find the little path which the other pencil has\r\ndescribed in the air, while the former was transmitted by the plate\r\nof glass; and this path, compared with the thickness of the plate of\r\nglass, will give the proportion of the velocity of the light in the\r\nair, to its velocity within the glass.\r\n\r\nWe may also consider this problem in another point of view, with\r\nwhich it is convenient to make ourselves familiar. The duration of\r\neach undulation, as we have seen, does not depend on the greater or\r\nless velocity with which the [p446] agitation is propagated along\r\nthe fluid, but merely on the duration of the previous oscillation\r\nwhich gave it birth; consequently, when the luminous waves pass\r\nfrom one medium into another, in which they are propagated more\r\nslowly, each undulation is performed in the same interval of time as\r\nbefore, and the greater density of the medium has no other effect\r\nthan that of diminishing the length of the undulation, in the same\r\nproportion as the velocity of light is diminished: for the length\r\nof the undulation is equal to the space that the first agitation\r\ndescribes during the time of a complete oscillation. We may therefore\r\ncalculate the relative velocities of light in different mediums, by\r\ncomparing the length of the undulations of the same kind of light in\r\nthose mediums. Now, the middle of the central stripe is formed by the\r\nreunion of such rays of the two pencils as have performed the same\r\nnumber of undulations, in their way from the luminous point, whatever\r\nmay be the nature of the mediums transmitting the light. If then the\r\ncentral stripe is brought towards the side of the pencil which has\r\npassed through the glass, it is because the undulations of light are\r\nshorter within the glass than in the air; and it is necessary, in\r\nconsequence, that the path described on this side should be shorter\r\nthan the other, in order that the number of undulations may remain\r\nthe same. Let us suppose, then, that the central stripe has been\r\ndisplaced to the extent of twenty breadths of fringes, for example,\r\nor of twenty times the interval between the middle points of two\r\nconsecutive dark stripes; we must necessarily conclude that the\r\ninterposition of the plate of glass has retarded the progress of\r\nthe pencil passing through it to the extent of twenty undulations;\r\nor that it has performed within the plate twenty undulations more\r\nthan the same pencil would have performed in an equal thickness of\r\nair, since each breadth of a fringe answers to the difference of a\r\nsingle undulation. If then we know the thickness of the plate, and\r\nthe length of an undulation of the light employed, which is easily\r\ndeduced from the measurement of the fringes, by the formula that has\r\nbeen given, we can calculate the number of undulations comprehended\r\nin the same thickness of air, and by adding twenty to the number, we\r\nshall have that of the [p447] undulations performed in the thickness\r\nof the glass; and the proportion of these two numbers will be that of\r\nthe velocities of light in the different mediums. Now this proportion\r\nis found by experiment the same with that of the sines of incidence\r\nand of refraction between air and glass; which agrees with the theory\r\nof the refraction of undulations, as will be seen hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe same experiment may be employed, on the other hand, for\r\ndetermining with extreme precision the thickness of a thin plate of a\r\nsubstance of known refractive density; placing it in the way of one\r\nof the two pencils of light, and measuring the displacement of the\r\nfringes which it occasions.\r\n\r\nThis method of determining refractive densities is however liable to\r\nsome difficulties, when we wish to apply it to a body much more dense\r\nthan air, such as water, or glass, for example; since it is necessary\r\nto employ a very thin plate only, in order that the fringes may not\r\nbe too much displaced for observation; and then it becomes difficult\r\nto measure the thickness of such a plate with sufficient accuracy.\r\nWe may, indeed, place in the way of the other pencil a thick plate\r\nof a transparent substance, of which the refractive density has been\r\nascertained by the ordinary methods, and we can then employ as thick\r\na plate of the new substance. But then it becomes simpler to measure\r\nits refractive density by the common method: [unless we choose to\r\nimmerse the whole apparatus in a fluid very nearly approaching\r\nto it in refractive density, which may sometimes be done without\r\ninconvenience. TR.]\r\n\r\nThe case, in which Mr. Arago’s experiment has a decided advantage\r\nover the direct method, is when we desire to determine very slight\r\ndifferences of velocity in mediums of nearly equal refractive\r\ndensity: for by lengthening the passage of the light in the two\r\nmediums of which we wish to compare the refractive density, we can\r\nincrease the accuracy of the results almost without limit. In order\r\nto form an idea of the extreme precision that may be attained by\r\nthese measurements, it is sufficient to observe that the length of\r\nthe yellow undulations in air being about .000021 E.I., there are two\r\nmillions of them in the length of about 42 inches. Now [p448] it is\r\nvery easy to observe the difference of one fifth of a fringe, which\r\ncorresponds to a retardation of one fifth of an undulation in one of\r\nthe pencils, that is, the ten millionth part of the whole length of\r\n42 inches; we might therefore, by introducing any gas or vapour into\r\na tube of this length, terminated by two plane glasses, estimate very\r\naccurately the variation of its refractive power.\r\n\r\nI take the length of an undulation of the yellow rays, which are\r\nthe most brilliant of the spectrum, and of which the dark and light\r\nstripes consequently coincide with the darkest and brightest stripes\r\nof the fringes produced by white light, which is commonly employed\r\nin these experiments, both because of its greater brightness, and\r\nbecause of the more marked character which it gives to the central\r\nstripe, so as to prevent any other from being mistaken for it.\r\n\r\nIt was an apparatus of this kind that Mr. ARAGO and myself employed\r\nfor measuring the difference of the refractive powers of dry air, and\r\nof air saturated with moisture at 80° F., which is so small, that it\r\nwould escape every other method of observation, because the greater\r\nrefractive power of aqueous vapour is almost exactly compensated\r\nby the less specific gravity of moist air. But, in the generality\r\nof cases, the slightest mixture of one vapour or gas with another\r\nproduces a considerable displacement in the fringes: and if we had\r\na series of experiments of this kind, made with care, the apparatus\r\nmight become a valuable instrument of chemical analysis.\r\n\r\n [To be continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n iii. _Remarks on the Action of_ CORPUSCULAR FORCES. _In a Letter to_\r\n Mr. POISSON.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am very glad to see that you have been applying your analytical\r\npowers to the investigation of the acustical effects of corpuscular\r\nforces, and that, among many more refined determinations, you, have\r\nconfirmed several of the results relating to sounding bodies, which\r\nwere published twenty years ago in my Lectures on Natural Philosophy:\r\nthough they were generally such as might have been derived from\r\nthe calculations of Bernoulli and Euler; which I attempted in some\r\n[p449] measure to simplify by the introduction of the element which\r\nI called the _Modulus of Elasticity_ of each substance. You have\r\nvery properly observed that it is often difficult to represent the\r\ncombination of these corpuscular forces by an integral, since in many\r\npractical cases the integral must vanish, where it would naturally be\r\napplied to the phenomena: and, from similar considerations, I trust\r\nyou will be prepared to admit the objections that I made long ago,\r\nto the reasoning of your great predecessor, Mr. Laplace, to whose\r\nstation in the mathematical world you appear so eminently qualified\r\nto succeed.\r\n\r\nThe equation, which may be called final, in Mr. Laplace’s Supplement\r\nto the Xth Book, p. 47, is _Q_ cos. (ω−θ) = (2ς−ς′) _K_ sin. θ. Now\r\nthis, in my opinion, is a perfect _reductio ad absurdum_: for _Q_\r\nmust _always_ be _incomparably_ less than _K_; the attraction of\r\nthe particles lying between a cylinder and its tangent plane being\r\n_always_ infinitely less than that of the particles in an angular or\r\nprismatic edge: or if this were denied in general, it would obviously\r\nbecome true when the cylinder itself becomes a plane, and _Q_\r\nvanishes altogether; which will always be the state of the problem,\r\nwhen the surface of the solid is so inclined to the horizon, that the\r\nsurface of the fluid may remain horizontal, the appropriate angle of\r\ncontact being unaltered in these circumstances, as it is easy to show\r\nby making the experiment with mercury.\r\n\r\nI entreat you to consider this objection with patient attention, and\r\nto tell me if you can find any arguments to supersede it. I would\r\nalso presume to ask your opinion of my own method of deducing the\r\nforce of capillarity from the elementary attractions and repulsions\r\nof bodies, at the end of my Illustrations of the Celestial Mechanics,\r\nArt. 382; Appendix A, p. 329 to 337.

MECHANICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _On the Adhesion of Screws_.—The following results, respecting the\r\nforce necessary to draw iron screws out of given depths of wood, are\r\nby Mr. Bevan, and should be placed by the side of those he has given\r\nwith regard to nails[128].\r\n\r\n “The screws I used were about two inches in length, 0.22 diameter at\r\n the exterior of the threads, 0.15 diameter at the bottom, the depth\r\n of the worm or thread being 0.035, and the number of threads in one\r\n inch = 12. They were passed through pieces of wood exactly half an\r\n inch in thickness, and drawn out by the weights specified in the\r\n following table:\r\n\r\n Dry beech       460 pounds\r\n Do. Do.         790\r\n Dry sound ash   790\r\n Dry oak         760\r\n Dry mahogany    770\r\n Dry elm         655\r\n Dry sycamore    830\r\n\r\n “The weights were supported about two minutes before the screws were\r\n extracted.\r\n\r\n “I have also found the force required to draw similar screws out of\r\n deal and the softer woods about half the above.\r\n\r\n “From which we may infer as a rule to estimate the _full_ force\r\n of adhesion, in hard wood . . . 200.000 _d_ δ _t_ = _f_,\r\n          and in soft wood . . . 100.000 _d_ δ _t_ = _f_,\r\n _d_ being the diameter of the screw; δ the depth of the worm\r\n or thread; and _t_ the thickness of the wood into which it is\r\n forced;—all in inches; _f_ being the force in pounds to extract the\r\n same.” We may, from the above experiments, observe the approximation\r\n to perfection in the art of screw making; for had the screw been\r\n greater in diameter, there would have been a waste of material, or\r\n had it been less, it would not have been sufficiently strong, which\r\n may be proved as follows: the cohesion of wrought iron has been\r\n found, from a number of experiments, to be about 43000 lbs. per\r\n cylindrical inch; and as the smallest diameter of screw used in my\r\n experiment was 0.15, it would have been torn asunder by a force of\r\n about 968 lbs.; or if the hard wood had been about 5/8 of an inch\r\n thick into which it had been screwed, the screw would have been\r\n broken instead of forcing its passage out of the wood.—_Phil. Mag. N.\r\n S._ ii. 291.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [128] See page 360, vol. xvii. of the former series of this Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Improvement in Steam-engines_.—According to the valuable records\r\nkept of the duty of the steam-engines at the mines in Cornwall,\r\na most important improvement has been effected in two [p454]\r\ninstances, of engines erected by Captain Samuel Grose; dependent\r\nentirely upon attention to the smaller details of the machines. The\r\nbest engines, heretofore, had not done more than raise forty millions\r\nof pounds of water one foot high, by each bushel of coals consumed,\r\nexcept indeed upon short occasions. In one of the cases in question,\r\nan engine at Wheal Hope, of sixty-inch cylinder, working single as\r\nusual, the duty rose to fifty, fifty-four, and fifty-five millions of\r\npounds; and in the other, an engine of eighty-inch cylinder, at Wheal\r\nTowan, the duty rose in\r\n\r\n April    61,877,545\r\n May      60,632,179\r\n June     61,762,210\r\n July     62,220,820\r\n August   61,764,166\r\n\r\nthus exceeding by nearly fifty per cent. what had been effected\r\nbefore that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Improved Clock_.—Among the articles displayed at the first\r\nNational Exhibition of the Objects of Arts and Industry, at\r\nNeufchatel, Switzerland, last year, was a clock made by F. Houriet,\r\nof Locle; in which steel was used only in the main springs and in the\r\naxes of the moveable parts; all the other parts were in brass, gold\r\nalloy, and white gold. The number of pieces in gold, gold and silver,\r\ngold and platina, is sixty-two: all the pivots turn on jewels, and\r\nthe functions of the free escapements are effected also by means of\r\npallets in precious stones. It had been supposed that the escapements\r\nand the spiral spring not being of steel, inconvenience would result\r\nfrom the smaller degree of elasticity, but numerous trials with\r\nfavourable results have removed the objection; and it appears that\r\ngold, hardened either by hammering or other means, is more elastic\r\nthan hardened and untempered steel. The clock had gone for six days,\r\nexposed to the contact of a magnet competent to lift twenty-five or\r\nthirty pounds, without suffering any derangement.—_Rév. Ency._\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Method of dividing Glass by Friction_.—The following method is\r\ndescribed by Dr. Hare: “Some years ago Mr. Lukin showed me that a\r\nsmall phial or tube might be separated into two parts, if subjected\r\nto cold water after being heated by the friction of a cord made to\r\ncirculate about it, by two persons alternately pulling in opposite\r\ndirections. I was subsequently enabled to employ this process in\r\ndividing large vessels of four or five inches in diameter, and\r\nlikewise to render it in every case more easy and certain by means\r\nof a piece of plank forked like a boot-jack, and also having a\r\nkerf cut by a saw, parallel to and nearly equidistant from the\r\nprincipal surfaces of the plank, and at right angles to the incisions\r\nproductive of the fork.\r\n\r\n“By means of the fork, the glass is easily held steadily by the\r\nhand of one operator; by means of the kerf, the string, while\r\n[p455] circulating about the glass, is confined to the part where\r\nthe separation is desired. As soon as the cord smokes, the glass is\r\nplunged in water, or if too large to be easily immersed, the water\r\nmust be thrown upon it; the latter method is always preferable when,\r\nupon immersing the body, the water can reach the inner surface.\r\nAs plunging is the most effectual method of employing the water\r\nin the case of a tube, I usually close the end which is to be\r\nimmersed.”—_Silliman’s Journal_, xiii. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Use of Soapstone in diminishing Friction_.—In a letter to\r\nProfessor Silliman upon this subject, Mr. E. Bailey of Boston, says,\r\n“I understand the Soapstone has been used for this purpose in the\r\nextensive manufactories at Lowell, for about two years, and with\r\ngreat profit and success. Besides answering the purpose to which it\r\nis applied very much better than any other substance that can be\r\nprocured, it saves a great deal of trouble and expense. It is first\r\nthoroughly pulverized, and then mixed with oil, tallow, lard, or\r\ntar, whichever may be the best adapted to the use for which it is\r\ndesigned. It is of course important to procure that which is free\r\nfrom _grit_, and it can be purified in a good degree by mixing the\r\npowder with oil, and decanting it after it has stood a few minutes.\r\nThe heavier particles will form a sediment to be rejected. It is used\r\nin all kinds of machinery where it is necessary to apply any unctuous\r\nsubstance to diminish friction, and it is said to be an excellent\r\nsubstitute for the usual composition applied to carriage-wheels.”\r\n\r\nSome idea of the value of soapstone thus applied, may be formed from\r\nthe following fact communicated by D. Moody, Esq., the superintendent\r\nof the tar-works on the mill-dam near this city. Connected with\r\nthe rolling machine of that establishment, there is a horizontal\r\nbalance-wheel, weighing _fourteen tons_, which runs on a step of\r\nfive inches diameter, and makes from seventy-five to one hundred\r\nrevolutions in a minute. About one hundred tons of iron are rolled in\r\nthis machine in a month; yet the wheel has sometimes been used from\r\nthree to five weeks without inconvenience, before the soapstone has\r\nbeen renewed. The superintendent thinks, however, that it ought to be\r\nmore frequently employed.\r\n\r\n“The use of soapstone was discovered at Lowell. It has been\r\nsaid never to fail in producing the desired result when applied\r\nto machinery which had began to be heated, even in those\r\ncases when nothing else could be found that would answer the\r\npurpose.”—_Silliman’s Journal_, xiii. 192.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _On peculiar Physical Repulsions, by_ M. Saigey.—I intend to give\r\nin this bulletin the description of a very simple apparatus, by means\r\nof which I have made many experiments, which have conducted me to the\r\nfollowing results:—\r\n\r\ni. All bodies exert between themselves a feeble repulsive action in\r\nordinary circumstances. The repulsion between bismuth and [p456]\r\nantimony and the poles of a magnetic needle, is a case of this\r\ngeneral law, and is not due to magnetism. Nor is it magnetism which\r\noccasions the direction of needles formed of other substances than\r\niron, announced lately by M. Becquerel.\r\n\r\nii. A very marked attraction may be observed between a cold and a\r\nheated body, or between two bodies of different temperature, whether\r\nscreens be interposed or not.\r\n\r\niii. The metallic plates in the Cabinet de Physique de Paris,\r\nintended for the repetition of M. Arago’s experiments on magnetism by\r\nrotation, contain more or less of iron capable of attracting a very\r\nmobile magnetic needle. These plates, and those of M. Arago, were\r\nmade by the same person and from the same materials.\r\n\r\niv. I believe that, in many cases, results obtained without the\r\nappreciable developement of magnetism or electricity, have been\r\nattributed to these powers; and from well-proved experiments I shall\r\ndeduce new results relative to the diurnal variation of the needle,\r\nthe direction of the plumb-line and the density, temperature and\r\nattraction of the planetary masses.—_Bull. Univ._ A. viii. 287.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _On the Magnetic Effects of Metals in Motion_.—M. Seebeck has\r\nendeavoured to determine the effects of various metals in diminishing\r\nthe oscillations of a magnetic needle 2-1/8 inches in length, and\r\nsuspended by a silk fibre three lines distant from and above the\r\nplates. The oscillations were counted from an amplitude of 45° to 10°.\r\n\r\n 116 oscillations above a plate of marble\r\n 112                      layer of mercury  2 lines in thickness.\r\n 106                      plate of bismuth  2          \"\r\n  94                               platina  0.4        \"\r\n  90                               antimony 2.0        \"\r\n  89                               lead     0.75       \"\r\n  89                               gold     0.2        \"\r\n  71                               zinc     0.5        \"\r\n  68                               tin      1.0        \"\r\n  62                               brass    2.0        \"\r\n  62                               copper   0.3        \"\r\n  55                               silver   0.3        \"\r\n   6                               iron     0.4        \"\r\n\r\nIt is also stated that he has found, from experiments, that by\r\nalloying such metals as are magnetic, like iron, nickel, and cobalt,\r\nwith other metals, which like antimony diminish the magnetic force,\r\nalloys are obtained entirely neutral in their effects; thus the\r\nalloys formed by four of antimony with one of iron, three of copper\r\nwith one of antimony, and two of copper with one of nickel, produce\r\nno diminution of the number of oscillations, these amounting to 116\r\nas with the plate of marble. These three alloys are, therefore, the\r\nbest for the manufacture of compasses, those of copper and nickel\r\nbeing the most malleable.—_Annal. des Phy. 1826. Bull. Univ._ A.\r\nviii. 136.

Plateau of\r\nLiege has endeavoured to determine the length of time during which\r\nthe impression of certain luminous rays upon the eyes remains; and\r\nhas given the following results:\r\n\r\n Flame              0″.242\r\n Ignited Charcoal   0″.229\r\n White              0″.182\r\n Blue               0″.186\r\n Yellow             0″.173\r\n Red                0″.184\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _On the Measurement of the Intensity of Light, by_ M. Peclet.—A\r\nvery usual photometrical process is to interpose an opaque body\r\nbetween a white screen and the two lights to be measured, and to move\r\nthe latter until the shadows produced are of equal intensity; the\r\nintensity of the lights being then as the square of their distances\r\nfrom the shadows they illuminate. Sometimes a translucent body, as\r\nunpolished glass or oiled paper, is used in place of an opaque one,\r\nthe shades produced by transmission being observed.\r\n\r\nIn both these methods, the apparent intensity of the shadow varies\r\nwith the position of the observer. If the shadows are equal when\r\nobserved from a point perpendicular to the white screen at the middle\r\nof the distance of the two shades, they will be no longer so on\r\nremoving from that position, and the shadow nearest to the observer\r\nwill always appear the darkest. These apparent variations are greater\r\nas the shadows are farther apart, or with reflected shadows as the\r\nscreen is smoother, or with transmitted shadows as the interposed\r\nobstacle is more diaphanous.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given of this fact is, that unpolished opaque bodies,\r\nlike paper, plaster, &c. never disperse the light incident upon them,\r\nin an uniform manner, more rays passing in the direction in which\r\nregular reflexion would take place, than in any other. Hence, when\r\ntwo equal shadows are produced upon such a surface, either by two\r\nequal lights at equal distances, or by two unequal lights at unequal\r\ndistances; the shadow nearest to the observer must necessarily appear\r\ndeeper than the other, because it is enlightened by the nearest\r\nlight, the rays from which are reflected in greatest abundance away\r\nfrom the observer; and, on the contrary, the shadow further from the\r\nobserver should appear lightest, because the rays which fall on it\r\nfrom the furthest light are reflected in greatest abundance towards\r\nthe side on which the observer stands. The reason, also, why the\r\neffect is greater as the shadows are further apart is evident; and\r\nwhy in every case it is reduced to nothing when the observer is in\r\na plane perpendicular to the screen and equidistant from the two\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts and explanations it may be concluded, that, in all\r\nphotometrical measurements by reflected shadows, the screens should\r\nhave all smoothness removed from them, and the two [p458] shadows\r\nbrought as near together as possible, and even made to touch or\r\nover-lap; or that, when this cannot be done, the observation should\r\nbe made from a point equidistant from the two shadows. As to the\r\nshadows by transmission, the apparent variations of intensity are so\r\ngreat for small changes in the position of the eye, as to render the\r\nmethod altogether inapplicable.—_Bull. Univ._ A. viii. 248.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _On the apparent Decomposition of White Light by a Reflecting\r\nBody when in Motion_.—The following experiment is described in the\r\nMSS. of M. Benedict Prevost and published by M. P. Prevost. A ray\r\nof solar light being introduced into a darkened chamber, is to have\r\na square piece of white paper about two inches in the side, passed\r\nacross it perpendicularly to the direction of the ray. The light\r\nreflected by the paper, instead of being white, will present a small\r\nwhite central portion, surrounded by the seven principal colours,\r\nnearly in the order of the prismatic spectrum. When a red surface is\r\nused instead of a white one, the decomposition of the light is still\r\nmore complete. When the paper has a slight blue tint, the effect\r\nis less perfect than with the white paper. With a black surface no\r\ncolours appear, but a sort of smoky shade towards the middle.

The surface\r\nof mercury in a tube 14.5 lines in diameter, is slightly rounded at\r\nthe edge; but, at the distance of two lines from the glass, capillary\r\ndepression disappears, and the surface is level. ii. The mercury in\r\na tube 5.8 lines in diameter is convex over the whole surface, the\r\ndepression being .035 of a line. iii. The depression is generally\r\nless in a vacuum than in the air, so that a syphon barometer gives\r\nresults too high, and the more so as the tube is smaller. iv.\r\nBarometers constructed with tubes five lines in diameter, do not\r\nrequire tapping to cause them to assume their proper height; and\r\ncomparatively slight blows easily make the mercury rise too high in\r\ntubes of a smaller diameter.—_Annal. der Phys. und Chem._\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Easy Method of reducing Barometrical Observations to a Standard\r\nTemperature, by_ S. Foggo.—The expansion of mercury deduced by the\r\ndifferent philosophers who have examined it, is given below; omitting\r\nthe results of Sir G. Shuckburgh, as being rather too far from the\r\nmean of the others.\r\n\r\n      Expansion of mercury, from 32° to 212° F.\r\n\r\n De Luc                        1-56th }\r\n Lavoisier and Laplace      1-55.22th }\r\n Halstrom                      1-55th } mean, 1-55.43th.\r\n Dulong and Petit            1-55.5th }\r\n\r\n[p459]\r\n\r\nFor 1° of Fahrenheit’s scale, this is equal to 1/9977.4, or\r\n.00010023: which may be called one ten-thousandth, without the most\r\ntrifling error in practice. The barometric column may, therefore, be\r\nreduced to the standard temperature of 32° F. by the following simple\r\nrule, which will make a table unnecessary. _Before the first three\r\nfigures of the observed height place two cyphers, multiply by the\r\ntemperature of the mercury −32°, and subtract the product from the\r\nobserved height_. Example; barometer 30.597, temperature of mercury\r\n74°.\r\n\r\n74° − 32° = 42°.00305 × 42 = .128 and 30.597 − .128 = 30.469 the\r\ncorrect height.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature of the mercury is lower than 32°, the\r\ntemperature is to be subtracted from 32°, and the product, obtained\r\nas before, is to be _added_ to the observed height. Thus, let the\r\nbarometer be as before, and the temperature 15°: then 32° − 15° =\r\n17°; .00305 × 17 = .052, and 30.597 + .052 = 30.649, the correct\r\nheight.—_Jameson’s Journal_, 1827, p. 378.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Diamond Lenses_.—I see by the last number of the Journal of\r\nScience and the Arts, that Mr. Varley has made a Diamond Lens, and\r\nalso a single microscope with such motions as enable the observer to\r\nfollow an animalcule in a diagonal direction. It is very odd, but\r\nthis is precisely my plan for a microscope, which I drew up about\r\nfour years ago; and as I could not get any optician to undertake it,\r\nI sent it to the Society of Arts, and recommended them to offer a\r\npremium for the best diamond lens, but they returned it. I have had\r\na microscope of this sort (made by W. and S. Jones, Holborn) about a\r\nyear and a half, and it answers the purpose completely; as a person\r\nnot at all used to microscopes may use a lens of 1/60 inch focus\r\nand find a small object with it, and bring any part of it into the\r\nfield of view with the greatest facility, and follow the motions of\r\nan animalcule in a diagonal direction. There are some alterations\r\nand improvements, which I have since made, that have rendered it a\r\nvery complete microscope; a drawing of which I could send you, if you\r\nthink it would be acceptable.\r\n\r\n                                      I am, Sir, yours, &c.\r\n _Tringham, Norfolk, July_ 9_th_, 1827.

DAKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _Sapphire Lenses for Single Microscopes_.—As it may justly\r\nbe feared that, notwithstanding the incontestable superiority\r\nof diamond lenses, the cost and difficulty attendant on their\r\nproduction will enhance their value beyond the reach of the public,\r\nMr. A. Pritchard, No. 18, Pickett Street, has applied himself with\r\nindefatigable perseverance to the formation of _Sapphire Lenses_.\r\nThe valuable experiments of Dr. Brewster have determined that the\r\nsapphire possesses a stronger refraction than any other substance\r\ncapable of giving a single image (diamond excepted), [p460] while\r\nits dispersive power is only 0.026 compared to water as 0.035. Thus\r\nif a sapphire is ground in the same tool which will form a lens\r\nof glass of the 1/60 inch focus, it will come out about the 1/100\r\ninch focus; being almost double the power of the glass in linear\r\namplification, and more than double in superficial; in which latter\r\nmode of estimation the powers of the glass and sapphire may be rated\r\nat 360,000 to 1,000,000. The faint blue tinge of the sapphire is not\r\nfelt in thin small lenses formed of this substance, which thus come\r\nnext in order to diamond ones, and form an excellent _pis aller_ for\r\nthose who cannot come at the latter. Many of our first microscopists\r\nare already in possession of them, and have honoured them with their\r\nunqualified approbation.\r\n\r\nThere is a property possessed by small single lenses formed by\r\nprecious stones, which is worthy of being commented on: viz. They\r\ncan be burnished fast into brass rings, and thus safely cleaned and\r\nremoved at pleasure from one setting to another. The cohesion of\r\nglass is too slight to permit this operation, during which it is\r\nalmost sure to burst into shivers.—C. R. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _On a Method of Securing and Preserving the Rowing Pins in\r\nBoats_.—Dear Sir,—To remove a petty inconvenience of hourly\r\noccurrence, by some simple contrivance, is often productive of a\r\ngreater mass of advantage than an invention of greater splendour, and\r\nof apparently more extensive utility.\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying drawing, you have a plan for preserving that\r\nindispensable requisite in a boat, the towels, or rowing pins; the\r\nloss of which is not only very teasing, but often productive of\r\nserious inconveniences; while the practice of stealing them from\r\neach other forms a constant source of petty depredations, leading to\r\nperpetual quarrels among seamen in harbours. He who has been detained\r\nthe better part of a day in the island of Sky, till half [p461] a\r\ndozen of these pins could be procured, well knows how to value that\r\ntrifle, the neglect of which has caused the loss of his voyage, and\r\nmight have led to that of his boat and his life also.\r\n\r\nFixed towels cannot well be used when boats are to be hoisted in\r\nalongside, as they are subject to be broken; and they are often\r\ninconvenient in getting in water casks, as well as in many other\r\ncases. Hence, pins capable of being unshipped are preferable. These\r\nare frequently lost, and the want is not always discovered till it\r\ncannot be replaced; or else it is not replaced without loss of that\r\ntime which is often so valuable at sea. Very often, also, the delay\r\nof even a minute is rendered inconvenient or even dangerous; when the\r\nboat is dragging alongside by the painter in a heavy sea, and the\r\nvessel is either drifting or standing on.\r\n\r\nThe drawing requires little explanation. By pulling at the lower pin,\r\nthe two upper are fixed at once, and on being unshipped they hang\r\nsecure from loss; while the lower one serves us a spare towel, should\r\nany be broken. As not one boat in twenty thousand is provided with\r\nthis invention, which is indeed scarcely known, it will not perhaps\r\nbe found undeserving a place in your Journal.—\r\n\r\n I am, &c.       J.

This affords an excellent composition\r\nfor anatomical injection, being very beautiful and very penetrating,\r\n(so much so, that it frequently returns by the veins,) and requiring\r\nno heat to be applied to the subject. The writer of this article\r\nfrequently had, in the course of his medical education, the office\r\nof preparing this injection, of which he has, however, unfortunately\r\nforgot the proportions, and the particular nature of the varnish. It\r\nwas, he thinks, a spirit varnish; the water was not mixed until the\r\ninstant the injection was wanted, when it was well worked up with the\r\nsyringe, and immediately thrown in; in the course of a night it would\r\nhave set beautifully. This particular kind of injection was invented\r\nby an American anatomist of the name of Ramsay, and preserved as a\r\nvaluable secret by him for the exclusive use of his own dissecting\r\nroom. The proportions, &c. of the ingredients will soon be attained\r\nby a few experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n II. CHEMICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Extraordinary Experiments on Heat and Steam by_ Mr. Perkins.—“I\r\ndiscovered that a generator at a certain temperature, although it had\r\na small crack in it, would not emit either water or steam. This fact\r\nI mentioned to a very scientific friend, who questioned its accuracy,\r\nand to convince him I tried the experiment; but he concluded that the\r\nexpansion of the metal must have closed the fissure. To remove every\r\ndoubt, I proposed to drill a small [p462] hole through the side of\r\nthe generator, which was accordingly done. After getting the steam up\r\nto a proper temperature, I took out the plug, and although we were\r\nworking the engine at thirty atmospheres, nothing was seen or heard\r\nto issue from the plug-hole; all was perfectly quiet: I next lowered\r\nthe temperature by shutting the damper, and opening the furnace door;\r\na singing from the aperture was soon observable, and when a coal was\r\nheld before it, rapid combustion ensued; nothing, however, was yet\r\nvisible: but as the temperature decreased, the steam became more and\r\nmore visible, the noise at the same increasing, until finally the\r\nroar was tremendous, and might have been heard the distance of half\r\na mile. This was conclusive. I should mention that, at the aperture,\r\nthe iron was red-hot.” “The hole was one _quarter of an inch_ in\r\ndiameter.”\r\n\r\n“The experiment affords some data towards answering the question,\r\nat what distance from the heated metal the water remained, when\r\nunder the pressure of thirty atmospheres; we may safely aver that it\r\nexceeded one-eighth of an inch.”—_Silliman’s Journal_, xiii. 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _On the Use of feeble Electric Currents, for effecting the\r\nCombination of numerous Bodies, by_ M. Becquerel.—A highly\r\ninteresting memoir on this subject is inserted in the thirty-fifth\r\nvolume of the _Annales de Chimie_, the intention of M. Becquerel\r\nbeing to show that electro-chemical powers may be used not only for\r\nthe decomposition and analysis of bodies, but also for the production\r\nof new compounds.\r\n\r\nThe facts described in the paper are commenced by one intended to\r\nillustrate future reasoning, by shewing what takes place when a very\r\nfeeble electric current traverses a metallic circuit, interrupted in\r\none part by a neutral solution, into which the two extremities of\r\nthe wires forming the circuit are immersed. Two small copper wires\r\nwere connected together by loops, and the two free ends joined to the\r\nends of a galvanometer wire; the circuit was then cut in one place,\r\nand the extremities immersed in a solution of chloride of sodium.\r\nThen, if one of the loops be raised to a red heat by a spirit lamp,\r\nan electric current is produced, the heated loop furnishing negative\r\nelectricity. Now if the ends plunged in the saline solution are\r\nterminated by platina or gold wires, _no current_ of electricity is\r\nobserved; with silver terminations, the current is very feeble; but\r\nwith wires of zinc, lead, iron or tin, the current is very energetic.\r\nThese remarkable effects, highly important in the phenomena hereafter\r\nto be considered, are no way connected with the conductibility of\r\nthe metals; for lead and zinc, which are the worst conductors, are\r\nthose which, with the copper, produce the most powerful effects. The\r\ncurrent ceases altogether as soon as the lamp is removed.\r\n\r\nAs the zinc, copper, lead, and iron, belong to the class of oxidable\r\nmetals, M. Becquerel concludes, from this experiment, that [p463]\r\nwhen very feeble electricities are generated in any point of a\r\nmetallic circuit, interrupted by a saline solution, _a current of\r\nelectricity is formed or not, according as the two similar metallic\r\nterminations, which dip into the solution, belong to an oxidable or\r\nnon-oxidable metal_. If the saline solution be replaced by an acid,\r\n_then_ a current will be obtained, though platina wires be used;\r\nbecause that kind of fluid does not interrupt the current.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the production of new compounds by electro-chemical\r\npowers, very much depends upon the strength of the power employed,\r\nand M. Becquerel only pretends, as yet, to indicate a new field of\r\nresearch, and not to point out the precise paths to be pursued.\r\nTwo methods may be adopted. As an illustration, let a tube, from\r\n4 to 8 hundredths of an inch in diameter, be bent into the form\r\nof the letter U, and place a plug of amianthus at the bend, to\r\nprevent the mixture of the fluids in the limbs: into one leg put\r\na mixture of deutoxide of copper and solution of the sulphate of\r\ncopper, the former will fall to the bottom; into the other put a\r\nsaturated solution of common salt, and also an excess of the dry\r\nsubstance, then communicate the two fluids by a plate of copper.\r\nVery shortly the end plunged in the sulphate will be covered with\r\nmetallic copper, and the acid set free will act upon the oxide of\r\ncopper below and form more sulphate, so that a set of decompositions\r\nand recompositions will occur, and ultimately comparatively large\r\ncrystals of copper will be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the other branch of the tube, a portion of the salt will be\r\ndecomposed, the muriatic acid will act upon the copper, which is\r\noxidised in consequence of its positive state, and will probably\r\nproduce an oxychloride, which will combine with the chloride of\r\nsodium, and then octoedral crystals will be formed on the plate of\r\ncopper. The effects are produced either with or without access to air.\r\n\r\nWhen the crystals are well dried and inclosed in a tube hermetically\r\nsealed, they suffer no change; but they are decomposed by water into\r\nchloride of sodium and submuriate of copper.\r\n\r\nIf the voltaic experiment be continued for one or two months, the\r\ncrystals, from being colourless and limpid, become violet, and\r\nultimately acquire an emerald green hue, still remaining transparent.\r\nIf the chloride of sodium side be tested, it will be found that soda\r\nis evolved during the experiment. A piece of copper simply immersed\r\nin a solution of common salt, produces nothing more than a submuriate\r\nof copper, which precipitates.\r\n\r\n_With silver_.—If a similar tube to that described have both limbs\r\nfilled with a solution of salt, a platina wire introduced into one\r\nlimb, a silver wire into the other, the extremities of the wire\r\nconnected so as to form a voltaic circuit, and the whole left for\r\nsome months, in about fifteen days crystals will be observed on the\r\nsilver wire; these will gradually increase and assume a rhomboidal\r\nform. They have not yet been particularly examined, but [p464] are\r\nknown to be unchanged by water: during a long experiment they change\r\ncolour, becoming, first, violet, then blue.\r\n\r\nExperiments similar to that with the copper, when repeated with the\r\nsame solutions, &c., but the substitution of plates of lead and tin\r\nfor the copper plates, produced crystalline double chlorides of these\r\nmetals and sodium.\r\n\r\nMuriate of ammonia being substituted for common salt in these\r\nexperiments, another series of double compounds was obtained with\r\ncopper, silver, lead, and zinc.\r\n\r\nA double chloride of barium and lead was formed slowly in a similar\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhen a solution of the iodide of potassium or sodium was used instead\r\nof the solution of salt, then double iodides were obtained: thus\r\nwith lead rather a rapid formation of silky crystals occurred upon\r\nthe lead, which, when examined by water, were decomposed, producing\r\niodide of lead and solution of iodide of potash or soda. A tube\r\ntwo or three times the diameter of the former may be used for the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe second method of producing new combinations by weak\r\nelectro-chemical powers, depends upon the electro-motive action,\r\nwhich is caused whenever a metal touches the oxides, or an oxide\r\nof another metal. If an oxide of a metal, a plate of metal, and a\r\nliquid be put into a tube closed at one extremity, there will be an\r\nelectro-motive action of the metal with the oxide, and of the liquid\r\nwith both these bodies; and the chemical effect will be according to\r\nthe resultant of these three forces, which can only be ascertained by\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the effects thus produced, three tubes, from\r\neight to twelve hundredths of an inch in diameter, were prepared,\r\na little protoxide of lead being put into one, deutoxide into the\r\nsecond, and peroxide into the third; solution of muriate of ammonia\r\nand a plate of lead were then added to each tube. After a time, lead\r\nwas precipitated in the first tube, very slight chemical changes took\r\nplace in the second, but a large quantity of double chloride of lead\r\nand ammonia crystallized upon the lead in the third, in the form of\r\nneedles. Thus very different effects were produced, according to the\r\nstate of oxidation.\r\n\r\nSolution of salt gave similar results with the oxides of lead and\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nThe oxides of copper, with solutions of alkaline muriates, gave\r\ncurious results. With muriate of ammonia, crystals were produced of\r\nconsiderable size, and different to those obtained by the former\r\nprocess. In this experiment, the black and anhydrous deutoxide of\r\ncopper gradually acquired a blue colour, as if a hydrate were formed\r\nunder the influence of the feeble electric current formed by the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nCopper, its deutoxide, and solution of corrosive sublimate, produced\r\na double chloride, crystallizing in plates, and possessing a metallic\r\nlustre. [p465]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Crystallization of Metallic Oxides_.—If a solution of nitrate of\r\ncopper, mingled with very fine charcoal powder, or even deutoxide\r\nof copper, be put into a similar tube to that described in the last\r\narticle, then a plate of copper be introduced and the vessel closed\r\nup, in about fifteen days small red transparent octoedral crystals\r\nof protoxide of copper will be formed on the plate of metal. Other\r\nmetals have been subjected to similar experiments, but probably have\r\nnot yet remained long enough under action.—_Ann. de Chimie_, xxxv.\r\n113.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _On Bromine, by_ M. A. de la Rive.—M. de la Rive has remarked\r\na curious fact respecting the conducting power of fluids for\r\nelectricity in the habitudes of bromine and water. He found, in the\r\nfirst place, as M. Balard had stated, that pure dry bromine did not\r\nconduct the electricity of a voltaic battery, consisting of sixty\r\npairs of plates very strongly charged, a delicate galvanometer being\r\nthe test: a similar experiment was then made with pure water, the\r\nwater being contained in a glass capsule, and communicated with the\r\nbattery and galvanometer by platina wires[129], and the deviation\r\nof the needle was scarcely sensible. Some other experiments induced\r\nM. de la Rive to believe, that water perfectly distilled and put\r\ninto vessels made of substances absolutely unacted upon, would not\r\nconduct any portion of electricity: the purer the water, and the\r\nmore unchangeable the substance of the vessel, the feebler does the\r\nconducting power become, until at last it is insensible.\r\n\r\nA few drops of bromine were then added to the water, which soon\r\nacquired a yellow colour, by dissolving a small portion of\r\nthe substance; being now included in the voltaic circuit, the\r\ngalvanometer needle was deviated 70°, and an abundant disengagement\r\nof gas took place from the platina wires. These were oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, in the usual proportion, proving that the water only had\r\nbeen decomposed.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments it results, that a body which does not at all\r\nconduct voltaic electricity, or at least but very badly, namely,\r\n_pure water_, may be rendered a very good conductor, by its mixture\r\nwith a few drops of perfectly _non-conducting_ substance, namely,\r\n_bromine_. M. de la Rive has found the same fact to occur with\r\niodine, and iodine and water; and his father had observed, in a\r\ncourse of experiments made a long time ago on the conducting power of\r\nfluids, that diluted sulphuric acid is a better conductor than very\r\nmuch concentrated acid: may not anhydrous sulphuric acid then be a\r\nnon-conductor like bromine, &c.?—_Annales de Chimie_, xxxv. 161.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [129] See, on this point, the statement by M. Becquerel, p. 462,\r\n relative to the use of platina wires, when forming a communicating\r\n medium with fluids.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Elementary Nature of Bromine_.—Iodine colours a solution of\r\nstarch blue, bromine renders a similar solution orange colour. M.\r\nA. de la Rive added a few drops of bromine to a solution of starch\r\n[p466] coloured blue by iodine, and obtained a compound which gave\r\ntwo distinct colours with starch, one brown, the other yellow; the\r\ndifference of colour corresponding with the two bromides of iodine\r\ndescribed by M. Balard. These compounds of iodine and bromine,\r\ndissolved in a solution of starch, were subjected to the voltaic\r\npile: immediately the yellow solution became blue about the negative\r\npile, and orange about the positive pile, indicating the separation\r\nand places of the iodine and bromine. Thus the smallest quantity of\r\niodine may be discovered in bromine; but when the experiment was\r\nresorted to, to prove whether the idea thrown out, that bromine was a\r\ncompound of chlorine and iodine, was founded in fact or not, it gave\r\nno such indication, and a solution of bromine in starch electrified\r\nfor a long time together, gave no appearance of iodine. Hence M. de\r\nla Rive concludes, that bromine contains no iodine, but is an element\r\nanalogous to iodine and chlorine.\r\n\r\nWhen bromine and iodine are combined, the former passes to the\r\npositive pole, and is consequently more negative than the latter;\r\nwhich accords with the observation of M. Balard, that it should\r\noccupy a place between chlorine and iodine.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Bulletin Universelle_, when the letter to M. Arago,\r\ncontaining an account of the facts above referred to, was read to\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, that body decided that the assertion of M.\r\nDumas that bromine was a compound of chlorine and iodine should be\r\nconsidered as retracted, and that it should be so entered, upon the\r\nprocès-verbal of the sitting.—A. viii. 209.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Quantity of Bromine in Sea-Water_.—One hundred pounds of\r\nsea-water, taken up at Trieste, treated by chlorine, ether, &c.,\r\naccording to M. Balard’s process, produced five grains of bromide\r\nof sodium, or 3.278 grains of bromine. It would appear that, in the\r\nsea-water of Trieste, the bromine is unaccompanied by any iodine, and\r\nthe same is the case, according to M. Hermbstadt, with the waters of\r\nthe Dead Sea. In the water of the Mediterranean, on the contrary,\r\niodine always appears with the bromine.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Sale of Bromine_.—The discoverer of bromine, M. Balard, has\r\nbeen enabled, by his improvements, to prepare that peculiar body\r\nin quantities sufficient to permit its sale. It may be obtained\r\nat his shop, Rue Argenterie à Montpellier, or at M. Quesneville’s\r\nmanufactory of chemical substances at Paris. The price is four francs\r\nthe gros (about 60 grains), fourteen francs the half ounce, and\r\ntwenty-three francs the ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Preparation of Iodous Acid_.—M. Pleischl says that, in preparing\r\nthis acid, three parts of chlorate of potash with one of iodine are\r\nto be used, and not equal parts according to M. Sementini; and also\r\nthat it is indispensable to cool the receiver considerably during the\r\nwhole operation. [p467]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _On a peculiar Nitric Acid, and Sulphate of Potash, by_ Mr.\r\nPhillips.—For the purpose of preparing nitric acid of the greatest\r\nstrength, Mr. Phillips mixed 70 parts of nitre with 70 parts of oil\r\nof vitriol, S. G. 1.8442 at 60°, and distilled for eight hours. The\r\nnitric acid obtained was reddish yellow, weighed 46.13 parts, was of\r\nS. G. 1.5033, and by an experiment on carbonate of lime, was found\r\nequivalent to 34.24 of that substance; the latter fact indicates\r\nthat 36.98 of real acid was present, and the liquid acid therefore\r\nconsisted of\r\n\r\n Real nitric acid   36.98 or  80.16\r\n Water               9.15     19.84\r\n                    -----    ------\r\n                    46.13    100.00\r\n\r\nSupposing this acid to be a definite compound of two atoms of acid,\r\n108, and three of water 27, it would consist of\r\n\r\n Real acid   36.90 or  80\r\n Water        9.23     20\r\n             -----    ---\r\n             46.13    100\r\n\r\nThe salt remaining in the retort weighed 92.87 parts; nearly this\r\nweight of water being added and heated, the whole was dissolved,\r\nand on cooling, a salt, consisting of extremely minute filaments\r\nresembling asbestos, was obtained, which, by capillary attraction,\r\nretained a part of the residual solution so powerfully, that it was\r\nnecessary to absorb it by filtering paper.\r\n\r\nAlthough it appeared improbable that the crystals could be a variety\r\nof the known form of bisulphate of potash, yet supposing it might\r\nbe that salt with either less, or more than two atoms of water, Mr.\r\nPhillips proceeded to its analysis. Some of the salt was readily\r\ndried by exposure to the air of a warm room: 100 grains, by muriate\r\nof baryta gave 154.75 grains of sulphate of baryta, equivalent\r\nto 52.45 sulphuric acid: 109 grains heated to redness, lost 21.6\r\nsulphuric acid and water, and left 78.4 grains of neutral sulphate\r\nof potash. The latter contain 35.6 grains of sulphuric acid, which,\r\nsubtracted from the whole quantity of 52.45, indicates 16.85 as the\r\nquantity dissipated by heat; and this again, subtracted from the\r\n21.6, indicates 4.75 water in the crystals. The quantity of acid\r\nseparated by heat is, therefore, very nearly half that remaining\r\nin the neutral sulphate, and the salt in question appears to be a\r\nsesquisulphate of potash, consisting of\r\n\r\n                                 theory.  experiment.\r\n 3 atoms sulphuric acid   120     55.33      52.45\r\n 2  \"  potash              96     42.66      42.80\r\n 1 atom water               9      4.00       4.75\r\n                          ---     -----     ------\r\n                          225     99.99     100.00\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips found it difficult to prepare the sesquisulphate free\r\n[p468] from bisulphate; and on repeating the attempt to procure it\r\nexactly as before, obtained a large quantity of bisulphate, and a\r\nsmall quantity of the peculiar salt; although the quantity of water\r\npresent is known to have an important influence on the nature of\r\nthe sulphates produced, yet the precise circumstances on which the\r\nformation of sesquisulphate depends, are at present unknown.—_Phil.\r\nMag. N. S._, ii. 429.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _On certain Properties of Sulphur_.—The effect of heat upon\r\nsulphur in first fusing it, but afterwards causing diminution of\r\nfluidity in a certain degree proportionate to the temperature, has\r\nbeen long and generally known, as well also as the peculiar soft\r\nstate into which the sulphur may be brought, by pouring it, when hot\r\nand thickened, into cold water. M. Dumas has been led to examine\r\nthese phenomena for the purpose of acquiring a precise and particular\r\nknowledge of the effects and changes.\r\n\r\nFused sulphur began to crystallize between 226° and 228°. Its fusing\r\npoint may be considered as 226°.4. Between 230° and 284° it is as\r\nliquid as a clear varnish, and of the colour of amber; at about 320°\r\nit begins to thicken, and acquire a red colour; on increasing the\r\nheat, it becomes so thick, that it will not pour. This effect is most\r\nmarked between 428° and 572°; the colour being then a red-brown. From\r\n572° to the boiling point it becomes thinner, but never so fluid as\r\nat 248°. The deep red-brown colour continues until it boils.\r\n\r\nWhen the most fluid sulphur is suddenly cooled, it becomes brittle,\r\nbut the thickened sulphur, similarly treated, remains soft, and more\r\nsoft as the temperature has been higher. Thus, at 230°, the sulphur\r\nwas very liquid, and yellow; and cooled suddenly by immersion in\r\nwater, it became yellow and very friable; at 374° it was thick,\r\nand of an orange colour, but by cooling, became at first soft and\r\ntransparent, but soon friable, and of the ordinary appearance; at\r\n428°, it was red and viscid, and when cooled, soft, transparent,\r\nand of an amber colour; at the boiling point it was deep brown red\r\ncolour, and when cooled very soft, transparent, and of a red-brown\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, as is sometimes stated, to heat the sulphur a\r\nlong time to produce this effect; all depends upon temperature. The\r\nonly precaution necessary is, to have abundance of water, and to\r\ndivide the sulphur into small drops or portions, that the cooling may\r\nbe rapid. If it be poured in a mass, the interior cools slowly, and\r\nacquires the ordinary hard state. When the experiment is well made at\r\n446°, the sulphur may be drawn into threads as fine as a hair, and\r\nmany feet in length.\r\n\r\nM. Dumas, in remarking upon this curious effect of sudden cooling,\r\nclasses it with the similar effect which occurs with bronze. Although\r\ndifficult to assign the exact cause, yet he notices that the tendency\r\nto crystallize can evidently be traced as influential over some of\r\nthe appearances, the hardness and opacity, for instance, [p469]\r\nwhich always occur together when the crystalline state is assumed;\r\nwhereas, when rapid cooling has hindered crystallization, the mass\r\nremains soft and transparent, until it crystallizes, which usually\r\nhappens in twenty or thirty hours.—_Ann. de Chimie_, xxxvi. 83.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _On the Fluidity of Sulphur and Phosphorus at common\r\ntemperatures_, by Mr. Faraday.—I published some time ago a short\r\naccount of an instance of the existence of fluid sulphur at common\r\ntemperatures[130]; and though I thought the fact curious, I did not\r\nesteem it of such importance as to put more than my initials to\r\nthe account. I have just learned, through the _Bulletin Universel_\r\nfor September, p. 178[131], that Signor Bellani had observed the\r\nsame fact in 1813, and published it in the _Giornale di Fisica_,\r\nvol. vi. (old series). I also learn, by the same means, that M.\r\nBellani complains of the manner in which facts and theories, which\r\nhave been published by him, are afterwards given by others as new\r\ndiscoveries; and though I find myself classed with Gay-Lussac, Sir\r\nH. Davy, Daniell, Bostock, &c., in having thus erred, I shall not\r\nrest satisfied, without making restitution, for M. Bellani, in this\r\ninstance, certainly deserves it at my hand.\r\n\r\nNot being able to obtain access to the original journal, I shall\r\nquote M. Bellani’s very curious experiments from the Bulletin, in\r\nwhich they appear to be fully described. “The property which water\r\npossesses, of retaining its fluid states, when in tranquillity, at\r\ntemperatures 10° or 15° below its freezing point, is well known;\r\nphosphorus behaves in the same manner; sometimes its fluidity may\r\nbe retained at 13° (centigrade?) for a minute, an hour, or even\r\nmany days. What is singular is, that, though water cooled below\r\nits freezing point, congeals easily upon slight internal movement,\r\nhowever communicated, phosphorus, on the contrary, sometimes retains\r\nits liquid state even at 3°, even though it be shaken in a tube or\r\npoured upon cold water. But, as soon as it has acquired the lowest\r\ntemperature which it can bear without solidifying, the moment it\r\nis touched with a body at the same temperature, it solidifies so\r\nquickly, that the touching body cannot penetrate its mass. If the\r\nsmallest morsel of phosphorus is put into contact with a liquified\r\nportion, the latter infallibly solidifies, though it be only a single\r\ndegree below the limit of temperature necessary; this does not always\r\nhappen when the body touching it is heterogeneous.\r\n\r\n“Sulphur presented the same phenomena as phosphorus; fragments of\r\nsulphur always produced the crystallization of cold fluid portions.\r\nHaving withdrawn the bulb of a thermometer which had been plunged\r\ninto sulphur at 120°, it came out covered with small globules of\r\nsulphur, which remained fluid at 60°; and having touched these one\r\nafter another with a thread of glass, they became solid: although\r\nseveral seemed in contact, yet it required that each [p470] should\r\nbe touched separately. A drop of sulphur, which was made to move\r\non the bulb of the thermometer, by turning the instrument in a\r\nhorizontal position, did not congeal until nearly at 30°; and some\r\ndrops were retained fluid at 15°, _i. e._ 75° of Reaumur below the\r\nordinary point of liquefaction.”\r\n\r\nThe _Bulletin Universel_ then proceeds to describe some late and new\r\nexperiments of M. Bellani, on the expansion in volume of a cold dense\r\nsolution of sulphate of soda during the solidification of part of the\r\nsalt in it. The general fact has, however, been long and well known\r\nin this country and in France; and the particular form of experiment\r\ndescribed is with us a common lecture illustration. The expansion, as\r\nascertained by M. Bellani, is 2/87 of the original volume of fluid.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Bulletin, M. Bellani also claims, though certainly\r\nin a much less decided manner than the above, the principal ideas\r\nin a paper which I have published on the existence of a limit to\r\nvaporization, and I referred back to the _Giornale di Fisica_ for\r\n1822, (published prior to my paper,) for the purpose of rendering\r\njustice in this case also. Here, however, the contact of our ideas\r\nis so slight, and for so brief a time, that I shall leave the papers\r\nin the hands of the public without further remarks. It is rather\r\ncurious to observe how our thoughts had been at the same time upon\r\nthe same subject. Being charged in the Bulletin with quoting an\r\nexperiment from a particular page in M. Bellani’s memoir, (which\r\nI did from another journal, in which the experiment only was\r\ndescribed,) I turned to the original place, and there, though I found\r\nthe experiment I had transferred, I also found another which I had\r\npreviously made on the same subject, and which M. Bellani had quoted.\r\n\r\nI very fully join in the regret which the _Bulletin Universel_\r\nexpresses, that scientific men do not know more perfectly what has\r\nbeen done, or what their companions are doing; but I am afraid the\r\nmisfortune is inevitable. It is certainly impossible for any person\r\nwho wishes to devote a portion of his time to chemical experiment, to\r\nread all the books and papers that are published in connexion with\r\nhis pursuit; their number is immense, and the labour of winnowing out\r\nthe few experimental and theoretical truths which in many of them\r\nare embarrassed by a very large proportion of uninteresting matter,\r\nof imagination, and of error, is such, that most persons who try the\r\nexperiment are quickly induced to make a selection in their reading,\r\nand thus inadvertently, at times, pass by what is really good.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [130] Quarterly Journal of Science, xxi. 392.\r\n\r\n [131] The Italian Journal has not yet arrived in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Separation of Selenium from Sulphur_.—Berzelius says, that\r\nthese substances, so much resembling each other in their general\r\nproperties, may be easily separated by the following process. When\r\nsulphuret of selenium is fused with carbonate of potash, the alkali\r\nnot being excess, the fused mass, dissolved in water, leaves selenium\r\nundissolved and free from sulphur. [p471]\r\n\r\nSome of the sulphuret of selenium from Lukawitz, in Bohemia, was\r\ndissolved in potash, and the solution converted into hyposulphite\r\nby exposure to the air at the temperature of 65° F.; 0.1125 of the\r\nsulphuret experimented with were precipitated, and found to be _pure\r\nselenium_. The solution being of a deeper red colour than that of the\r\ncommon sulphuret, a piece of sulphur was put into it, and the whole\r\nboiled for a moment; a quarter of a grain of selenium, perfectly free\r\nfrom sulphur, was precipitated.\r\n\r\nA solution of a neutral seleniate, or of one with excess of base,\r\nis soon rendered turbid by having sulphuretted hydrogen passed\r\nthrough it. At first pure selenium separates; afterwards sulphuret\r\nof selenium; and, lastly, mere sulphur. The solution should be\r\nconsiderably diluted; when concentrated, the precipitate formed\r\nis of a flame yellow colour, but soon becomes brownish-black, and\r\nsulphur is deposited, sometimes crystallizing at the surface of the\r\ndeposite.—_Phil. Mag., N. S._, ii. 390.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _On a new Compound of Selenium and Oxygen—Selenic Acid, by_\r\nMM. Mitscherlich and Nitzsch.—This acid contains half as much more\r\noxygen as that discovered by M. Berzelius, and with potash forms a\r\nneutral salt, having the same form and optical properties as sulphate\r\nof potash, containing no water when crystallized, and producing\r\ninsoluble precipitates with barytic salts. The acid is isomorphous\r\nwith the sulphuric, and may with propriety be called _selenic acid_,\r\nthat described by M. Berzelius being considered as the _selenious\r\nacid_.\r\n\r\nThe new acid is easily prepared: for this purpose selenium, selenious\r\nacid, a selenite or a metallic selenuret is to be fused with nitre.\r\nSelenuret of lead, being the most abundant source, has been used for\r\nthis purpose, but being accompanied by sulphuret, the selenic acid\r\nis usually contaminated by sulphuric acid. The selenuret of lead\r\nis to be freed from carbonates by muriatic acid, and the residue\r\nmixed with its weight of nitrate of soda, and thrown gradually into\r\na red-hot crucible. Water then dissolves out seleniate nitrate and\r\nnitrite of soda, no selenium remaining in the residue. The solution\r\nquickly boiled, deposits anhydrous seleniate of soda, and this being\r\nseparated, by cooling crystals of nitrate of soda are formed; these\r\nbeing removed, ebullition again causes more seleniate to fall down,\r\nand proceeding in this way an imperfect separation is effected. The\r\nseleniate, like the sulphate of soda, is most soluble in water at\r\n181°. To purify the salt completely, the nitrite should be changed\r\ninto nitrate by nitric acid; but then sulphate of soda would remain\r\nas an impurity formed from sulphuret in the ore, and no attempt to\r\nseparate this has as yet succeeded.\r\n\r\nBut if the seleniate of soda be mixed with muriate of ammonia and\r\nheated, selenium, nitrogen and water come over, no trace of sulphur\r\nappearing. The selenium may, however, be dissolved in excess of\r\nnitric acid, and the selenious acid produced tested by [p472]\r\nmuriate of baryta, which would then separate sulphuric acid if\r\npresent; the clear solution is to be saturated with carbonate of\r\nsoda, evaporated to dryness, and the mixture of selenite and nitrate\r\nof soda obtained, fuzed in a porcelain crucible over a spirit-lamp.\r\nThen proceed by crystallization as before, and a pure seleniate of\r\nsoda will be produced.\r\n\r\nTo separate the selenic acid, the solution is to be decomposed\r\nby nitrate of lead; the seleniate of lead is as insoluble as the\r\nsulphate, and being well washed, is to be decomposed by a current\r\nof sulphuretted hydrogen, which has no action on the selenic acid;\r\nthe solution being filtered, is to be boiled, and is then diluted\r\nselenic acid. Its purity, as respects fixed bodies, is ascertained\r\nby its entire volatility; if sulphuric acid be present, it may be\r\nascertained by boiling a portion with muriatic acid, which produces\r\nselenious acid, and then testing by muriate of baryta, a precipitate\r\nindicates sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nFrom the isomorphism of selenic acid and its salts with sulphuric\r\nacid and its salts, M. Mitscherlich concluded, that the oxygen in the\r\nacid should be to that in selenious acid as 3 to 2; and to that in\r\nbases when it forms salt, as 3 to 1. These views were confirmed by\r\nexperiments. From the decomposition of seleniate of potash by muriate\r\nof baryta, it appeared that the seleniate was composed of\r\n\r\n Potash          42.16   oxygen    7.15\r\n Selenic acid    57.84    ----    21.79\r\n                ------\r\n                100.00\r\n\r\nThe composition of the acid was determined by boiling a certain\r\nweight of the seleniate of soda with muriatic acid in excess, and\r\ndecomposing the selenious acid formed by sulphite of soda; 4.88 of\r\nthe salt gave 2.02 of selenium, from which, and the above result, it\r\nwould appear that the acid is formed of\r\n\r\n Selenium     61.4\r\n Oxygen       38.6\r\n             -----\r\n             100.0\r\n\r\nAccording to Berzelius, selenious acid consists of 100 selenium, and\r\n40.33 oxygen; and supposing this contains two-thirds the oxygen in\r\nselenic acid, the latter should consist of 62.32 and 37.68. From the\r\nanalysis above given of the seleniate of potash, it is evident that\r\n100 of selenic acid saturates a quantity of base captaining 12.56 of\r\noxygen, which would agree with the latter estimate of selenic acid.\r\n\r\n_Selenic acid_ is a colourless liquid, which may be heated to 536°,\r\nwithout sensible decomposition; above that it changes, and is,\r\nrapidly resolved into oxygen and selenious acid at 554°. Heated to\r\n329°, its specific gravity is 2.524; at 512°.6 it is 2.6; at 509°\r\nit is 2.625; but by that time selenious acid has been formed in it.\r\nA portion of concentrated acid, from which the selenious acid had\r\n[p473] been removed, consisted of 84.21 selenic acid, and 15.75\r\nwater; but it is certain that the selenic acid begins to decompose\r\nbefore it has resigned the last portions of water.\r\n\r\nSelenic acid has a powerful attraction for water, and evolves much\r\nheat when mixed with it. It is not decomposed by sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen; so that the latter body may be used to decompose the\r\nseleniates of lead and copper. When boiled with muriatic acid it\r\nproduces selenious acid and chlorine, and the mixture, like aqua\r\nregia, will dissolve gold or platina. Selenic acid dissolves zinc\r\nand iron, evolving hydrogen; it dissolves copper, evolving selenious\r\nacid; and it dissolves gold, but not platina. Sulphurous acid has no\r\naction on selenic acid, but instantly decomposes the selenious acid.\r\nA solution containing selenic acid is easily decomposed, by first\r\nboiling it with muriatic acid, and then adding sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\nSelenic acid is but little inferior to sulphuric acid in its affinity\r\nfor bases; seleniate of baryta is not completely decomposed by\r\nsulphuric acid. Its combinations being isomorphous with those of\r\nsulphuric acid, and possessing the same crystalline forms, and the\r\nsame general chemical properties, present but very slight, though\r\nvery interesting differences from the sulphates. These will be\r\nresumed by M. Mitscherlich in a future memoir, with the express\r\nobject of illustrating the theory of Isomorphism.—_Ann. de Chimie_,\r\nxxxvi. 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _Preparation of Hyposulphuric Acid_.—According to M. Heeren, to\r\nobtain the greatest quantity of this acid in the process of passing\r\nsulphurous acid over black oxide of manganese, the temperature\r\nshould be low, and the oxide finely divided. The largest portion of\r\nhyposulphuric acid is formed at the commencement of the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _Singular Habitude of Phosphoric Acid with Albumen_.—MM.\r\nBerzelius and Englehart differed in their results respecting the\r\neffect of phosphoric acid on albumen; the latter found the acid\r\ncaused precipitation of the substance, the former the reverse.\r\nFortunately coming into company, they made some experiments, and\r\ndiscovered a very singular property of the acid. The acid in\r\nBerzelius’s laboratory not precipitating albumen, Dr. Englehart\r\nprepared a fresh portion from phosphorus and nitric acid, evaporating\r\nthe solution in a platina vessel, and heating it to redness. This\r\nacid, dissolved in water, precipitated both animal and vegetable\r\nalbumen abundantly. Another portion of acid, prepared by burning\r\nphosphorus in air, also precipitated albumen. After many experiments\r\nto discover the cause of difference in the acids, Dr. Englehart\r\nremarked, that the two acids he had prepared, gradually lost their\r\npower of precipitating albumen, and in some days were like the acid\r\nof Berzelius. This change took place both in open and closed vessels,\r\nand was not at all hastened by ebullition. [p474] Upon evaporating\r\nthe acid, and heating it to redness, it recovered its precipitating\r\npower, but gradually lost it again by a day’s repose. The cause of\r\nthis difference escaped detection; it evidently does not depend upon\r\na difference of oxidation. “May it not be supposed,” says Berzelius,\r\n“that there exists a chemical combination of phosphoric acid with\r\nwater, which is not formed until some time after solution, and which\r\nis incapable of precipitating albumen?”—_Annales de Chimie_, xxxvi.\r\n110.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. _Economical Preparation of Deutoxide of Barium_.—This process is\r\ndue to M. Quesneville. Nitrate of baryta is to be put into a luted\r\nearthenware retort, to which a tube is to be attached for the purpose\r\nof conveying the liberated gases to a water-trough. The retort is\r\nto be gradually heated to redness, and retained at that temperature\r\nas long as nitrous acid and azotic gas pass over; the evolution of\r\nthese substances indicates that nitrate of baryta still remains to\r\nbe decomposed, but the instant that pure oxygen gas passes off, the\r\nfire is to be removed and the retort cooled. The product of this\r\ndecomposition is a peroxide of barium; it falls to pieces in water,\r\nwithout producing heat, disengages oxygen when boiled with water,\r\nand is reduced to a protoxide by a strong heat. When acted upon by\r\nsulphuric acid, no nitric acid was evolved; and when subjected to\r\nnitric acid, no nitric oxide was produced. The production of this\r\nperoxide is easily understood, for the protoxide formed by the\r\ndecomposition of the nitrate being in contact, at a red heat, with a\r\nlarge quantity of oxygen in a nascent state, combines with it, and is\r\nretained, unless the heat be so high as to decompose it.—_Annales de\r\nChimie_, xxxvi. 108.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition and effect are precisely the same as those lately\r\npointed out by Mr. Phillips as occurring with potassium when the\r\nnitrate of potash is decomposed by heat.—See p. 483 of the last\r\nvolume of this Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. _Preparation of Aluminum—Chloride of Aluminum_.—According to\r\nthe accounts published, the following process has succeeded in\r\nthe hands of M. Oersted, in decomposing alumina and evolving the\r\nbase _aluminum_. Pure alumina is to be heated to redness, and then\r\nwell mixed with pulverized charcoal; the mixture is to be placed\r\nin a porcelain tube, and being heated to redness, is to have dry\r\nchlorine gas passed over it; the charcoal reduces the alumina, the\r\nbase combines with the chlorine, and oxide of carbon is formed.\r\nThe chloride of aluminum is soft, crystalline, and evaporates at\r\na temperature a little above 212° Fahrenheit: it readily attracts\r\nmoisture from the atmosphere, and becomes hot when water is added\r\nto it. Being mixed with an amalgam of potassium, containing much\r\nof the latter metal, and immediately heated, chloride of potassium\r\nis formed, and the metallic base of the alumina combines with the\r\nmercury. The amalgam quickly oxidises by exposure to air; but being\r\nheated out of contact with the atmosphere, the mercury is [p475]\r\nvolatilized, and a metallic button is left, having the colour and\r\nsplendour of tin. A fuller account of the researches of M. Oersted on\r\nthis subject is expected.—Hensmann’s _Repertoire—Phil. Mag. N. S._ ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. _Mutual Action of Lime and Litharge_.—M. Fournet heated a\r\nmixture consisting of 7.12 parts of calcined lime, and 27.89 parts\r\nof litharge, very strongly; a coherent mass was obtained, which,\r\npulverized and digested in water, gave, when filtered, a perfectly\r\nclear and colourless liquor, which, when treated with sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, threw down an abundant black precipitate: hence oxide of\r\nlead is rendered soluble in water by means of lime.—_Ann. des Mines_,\r\ni. 538.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. _New Chloride of Manganese discovered by_ M. J. Dumas.—This\r\nchloride corresponds in proportions to the manganesic acid, and in\r\ncontact with water, produces muriatic and manganesic acids. It is\r\neasily obtained by putting a solution of manganesic acid into contact\r\nwith concentrated sulphuric acid, and fused common salt. Water and\r\nthe new chloride are formed; the former is retained by the acid, the\r\nlatter volatilizes in a gaseous form. The body does not, however,\r\nappear to constitute a permanent gas[132], for though, when produced,\r\nit appears as an elastic fluid having a cupreous or greenish tint,\r\nyet when passed into a tube, cooled to 5° or 4° Fahrenheit, it\r\ncondenses into a liquid of a brownish green colour.\r\n\r\nWhen the perchloride is produced in a large tube, its vapour\r\ngradually displaces the air present, and the tube becomes filled\r\nwith it; if it then be poured into a jar with moistened sides, the\r\ncolour of the gas changes as it comes into contact with the moist\r\nair; a thick smoke of a fine rose colour appears; and the sides of\r\nthe vessel acquire a deep purple colour due to the manganesic acid\r\nformed. The water thus coloured is abundantly precipitated by nitrate\r\nof silver, and, acted upon by a solution of potash, produces all the\r\nchanges of the mineral chamelion.\r\n\r\nThe most simple process for the preparation of this body appears to\r\nbe to form a common green chamelion, to convert it into red chamelion\r\nby sulphuric acid, and to evaporate the solution, which will give\r\na residue consisting of sulphate and manganesate of potash. This\r\nmixture, acted upon by concentrated sulphuric acid, produces the\r\nsolution of manganesic acid, into which the common salt is to be\r\nthrown in small pieces, until the vapours which rise are colourless;\r\nthe latter effect is a sign that all the manganesic acid is\r\ndecomposed, and that muriatic acid only is produced.\r\n\r\nAn analogous compound is formed when a fluoride is used in place of\r\nthe common salt. But all attempts as yet made to collect a sufficient\r\nquantity for examination have failed; the chloride, on the contrary,\r\nis easily formed and examined, although it is not so easy to preserve\r\nit.—_Annales de Chimie_, xxxvi. 81.

Hermann.—It is by no\r\nmeans easy to obtain this substance perfectly pure; the following\r\nis M. Hermann’s process: Oxide of zinc, or metallic zinc, is to\r\nbe dissolved in excess of sulphuric acid, and the solution being\r\nfiltered, sulphuretted hydrogen is to be passed through, so long\r\nas a brown or yellow precipitate is formed. Cadmium, lead, or\r\ncopper, being thus separated, and the solution filtered, it is to be\r\ntreated with solution of the chloride of lime, (bleaching powder,)\r\nby which the iron and manganese will be separated. The solution,\r\nagain filtered, is then to be crystallized in porcelain vessels, by\r\nwhich sulphate of lime is rejected, and a mother liquor separated,\r\nwhich usually contains cobalt and nickel. The crystals of sulphate\r\nof zinc are to be dissolved in as small a quantity of cold water as\r\npossible, and the sulphate of lime filtered out; then the solution,\r\nbeing rendered more dilute, is to be decomposed by carbonate of\r\nsoda in slight excess, and the precipitate well washed, dried, and\r\nheated to redness: it is then a perfectly pure and beautifully white\r\noxide.—_Bull.

Serullas\r\nhas pointed a striking instance of the separation of bismuth from\r\nmercury. He says a twelve hundred thousandth, and even less of\r\nbismuth, when dissolved in mercury, may be separated and rendered\r\nvisible by the addition of a certain quantity of the amalgam of\r\npotassium and a little water. A black powder is observed to rise from\r\nthe substance of the metal, and is a mixture of bismuth and mercury\r\nin a very divided state; it rises to the surface or adheres to the\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nCopper, lead, tin, and silver, are equally separated, but not so\r\npromptly, or so evidently to the eye as bismuth; for they are not\r\nassociated with divided mercury, at the time of their separation,\r\nlike the latter: with bismuth a mere atom is rendered visible, and M.\r\nSerullas thinks that chemistry does not present a more delicate test\r\nthan the amalgam of potassium for bismuth in mercury.—_Annales de\r\nChimie_, xxxiv. 195.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. _Sulphuret of Arsenic proportionate in Composition to Arsenic\r\nAcid_.—M. Pfaff acted upon arsenious acid by nitro-muriatic acid,\r\nand obtained a pure arsenic acid soluble in water, and deliquescent\r\nin the air. This, dissolved in 40 parts of water, had a current of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen passed through it, which instantly produced a\r\nyellow orange precipitate of a pulverulent form, continuing identical\r\nin composition, until no further precipitate was [p477] occasioned.\r\nThe fluid was then perfectly free from arsenic. The precipitate was\r\npure sulphuret of arsenic, soluble in ammonia when slightly heated,\r\nand composed of equal parts of sulphur and the metal.\r\n\r\nM. Pfaff further says that arsenic acid may be separated from its\r\ncombinations with bases, by dissolving the arseniates in nitric acid,\r\nand passing sulphuretted hydrogen through the solution; an abundant\r\nprecipitate of sulphuret of arsenic is formed, containing no trace of\r\nthe base of the arseniate decomposed.—_Bull. Univ._ A. viii. 256.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. _New Double Chromates_.—Mr. Stokes has obtained several new\r\nsalts, by mixing chromate of potash with metallic sulphates. Chromate\r\nof potash, mixed with sulphate of zinc, gave a precipitate of\r\nchromate of zinc; and the mother liquor, by concentration, yielded\r\ncertain yellow crystals in the form of a flat rhombic prism, which\r\nDr. Thomson had mistaken for impure sulphate of zinc, but which Mr.\r\nStokes recognised as a new compound: 50 grains gave 18.33 sulphuric\r\nacid; 0.18 chromic acid; 9.87 oxide of zinc; 8.91 potash; 12.6 water:\r\n0.11 loss.\r\n\r\nChromate of potash and sulphate of nickel were mixed in atomic\r\nproportions, and the solutions heated; after the chromate of nickel\r\nwas separated, they were evaporated to dryness. The residuum,\r\ndigested in water, was filtered, and the deep red solution obtained\r\nupon cooling, yielded grass green crystals in the form of oblique\r\nrhombic prisms; 50 grains of these, when analysed, gave 12.26\r\nsulphuric acid; 0.978 chromic acid; 8.2 oxide of nickel; 9.862\r\npotash; 12.7 water.\r\n\r\nA similar salt may be obtained by mixing chromate of potash and\r\nsulphate of copper. It is of a light green colour, and has precisely\r\nthe same form as the salts already described. In every case\r\ncrystals of bichromate of potash were produced in the second crop\r\ncrystals.—_Phil. Mag. N. S._ ii. 427.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. _Dobereiner’s finely divided Platina_.—The following is M.\r\nDobereiner’s process for obtaining finely divided platina, fit\r\nfor the performance of the experiment which he first made on the\r\ncombination of oxygen and hydrogen, at common temperatures. Mix\r\nmuriate of platina with a solution of neutral tartrate of soda in\r\na glass tube, half or three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and\r\ntwenty or thirty inches in length, and apply heat until the fluid\r\nbecomes slightly turbid; afterwards expose it for several days to\r\nthe sun’s rays. The greater part of the platina will separate from\r\nthe solution, and be deposited in minute laminæ, of a greyish black\r\ncolour on the sides of the glass; the tube and its contents are\r\nto be put into a glass vessel containing water, and it is to be\r\nfilled with hydrogen gas; the platina becomes almost immediately\r\nwhite and shining like silver, and may then be readily detached\r\nfrom the glass. During the reduction of the platina the tartaric\r\nacid is partly converted into carbonic and formic acids. “As the\r\ninflammation [p478] of the hydrogen,” it is said, “is caused by\r\nabstracting a portion of the caloric from the oxygen, effected by\r\nthe platina, the smaller the laminæ of the metal are, the more\r\nreadily is the incandescence produced.” Spongy platina for the lamps\r\nfor instantaneous light, is prepared of great power, by moistening\r\nthe muriate of ammonia and platina with a concentrated solution of\r\nammonia; the paste formed is to be heated to redness in an earthen or\r\nplatina crucible.—_Hensman’s Repertoire—Phil. Mag. N. S._ ii. 388.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. _New Metals_.—Professor Osann, of Dorpat, is said to have\r\ndiscovered three new metals in the crude platina, obtained from the\r\nUralian mountains. One, which has occurred only in one specimen of\r\nthe ore, resembles osmium in some of its compounds. The second forms\r\nwhite acicular crystals from a nitro-muriatic acid solution; these,\r\nwhen heated, being softened and reduced. The third is insoluble in\r\nnitro-muriatic acid, and, by a particular process yields a dark\r\ngreen-coloured oxide. The account as yet given of these substances is\r\nnot precise enough to allow of any judgment respecting their claim to\r\nthe character of new metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n27. _Analysis of Porcelain, Pottery, &c., by_ M.\r\nBerthier.—Earthenware manufactures are divided by M.

When an organic product, containing\r\nthree elements, hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, is burnt in oxygen\r\ngas, one of three things must happen: i. The original bulk of oxygen\r\ngas may remain the same, in which case the hydrogen and oxygen in\r\nthe substance must exist in it in the same proportions in which\r\nthey exist in water; or, ii. The original bulk of the oxygen may be\r\nincreased, in which case the oxygen must exist in the substance in\r\na greater proportion than it exists in water; or, iii. The original\r\nbulk of the oxygen gas may be diminished; in which case the hydrogen\r\nmust predominate. Hence it is obvious, that, in the first of these\r\ncases, the composition of a substance may be determined, by simply\r\nascertaining the quantity of carbonic acid gas yielded by a known\r\nquantity of it; while, in the other two, the same can be readily\r\nascertained by means of the same data, and by noting the excess or\r\ndiminution of the original bulk of the oxygen gas employed.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of two inverted glass syphons which act the\r\npart of gasometers; these are connected when required, by a small\r\ngreen glass tube, in which the substance is to be decomposed and\r\nburnt: the syphons are very carefully gradated; so that the quantity\r\nof gas in them can be accurately estimated; and are supplied with\r\ncocks both above and below, so that they can be filled with mercury,\r\nthe mercury drawn off and gas introduced, the gas transferred through\r\nthe green glass tube, or the contents retained in an undisturbed\r\nstate, with the utmost readiness and ease. The substance to be\r\ndecomposed, may be put into a platina tray, and introduced alone\r\ninto the green glass tube, and being there heated by a spirit lamp,\r\nbe burnt in the gas passing over it; or it may be mixed with pure\r\nsiliceous sand; or, what is most generally preferable, be mixed with\r\nperoxide of copper, which is always left, in consequence of the\r\nexcess of oxygen gas used, in the state in which it was introduced.\r\nAfter the experiment the volume of gas is easily [p481] corrected\r\nfor pressure, and if necessary for temperature, and the carbonic acid\r\nascertained by the removal and analysis of a portion. No correction\r\nis required for moisture, the gas always being used saturated with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nDr. Prout considers the principal alimentary substances as reducible\r\nto three great classes, the _saccharine_, the _oily_, and the\r\n_albuminous_; and his paper relates to the first of these. This, with\r\ncertain exceptions, includes the substances in which, according to\r\nMM. Gay Lussac and Thenard, the oxygen and hydrogen are in the same\r\nproportion as in water. Such substances are principally derived from\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, and being at the same time _alimentary_, Dr.\r\nProut uses the terms _saccharine principle_ and _vegetable aliment_\r\nas synonymous.\r\n\r\nThe following tables show some of Dr. Prout’s results with several\r\nsubstances, extreme care having been taken in every case to obtain\r\nthe bodies pure, and new processes often resorted to for that purpose.\r\n\r\n SUGAR.\r\n\r\n                            Carbon.

Henry and\r\nPlisson: About two pounds of bark are to be coarsely powdered and\r\nboiled with water, acidulated with sulphuric acid in the usual\r\nmanner. When the hot liquors are cleared, recently prepared and moist\r\nhydrate of lead is to be added until the fluid is neutral, and has\r\nacquired a faint yellow colour; this must be done carefully, lest too\r\nmuch hydrate of lead be added. As the decoloration of the decoction\r\nis necessary, the liquid, if it remains turbid until the next\r\nmorning, must have a little more hydrate added and be re-filtered,\r\nbut the operation is rarely subject to this inconvenience, being\r\nusually finished in a few hours. The yellow liquid contains a little\r\nkinate of lead, much kinate of lime, kinate of quinia or cinchonia,\r\na little colouring matter, and traces of other substances. The\r\nwashed deposite consists of colouring matter, combined with oxide of\r\nlead, sulphate of lead, and a portion of free quinia; contains no\r\nsub-kinate of lead.\r\n\r\nThe lead, dissolved in the fluid, is to be separated by a few drops\r\nof sulphuric acid, or a small current of sulphuretted hydrogen, and\r\nthe filtered liquid is to be precipitated by adding caustic lime,\r\npreviously mixed into a thin paste with water, until the earth is\r\nin very slight excess; in this manner the quinia is precipitated.\r\nThe addition of sulphuric acid readily converts this quinia into\r\nsulphate, [p483] which may be obtained in very white and silky\r\ncrystals. The fluid left after the separation of the quinia,\r\ncontains a kinate of lime almost pure. Being evaporated until of\r\nthe consistence of syrup, it readily crystallizes in a mass, which\r\nmay then be purified by recrystallization. The kinate of lime may\r\nbe precipitated by means of alcohol, and then be crystallized after\r\nsolution in water or diluted alcohol; or, by adding oxalic acid drop\r\nby drop, according to the directions of M. Vauquelin, the lime may\r\nbe separated and kinic acid obtained. Two thirds of the quinia or\r\ncinchonia in a specimen of bark may be thus separated, and with such\r\nfacility as to offer a ready test of the presence of these alkalies\r\nin any wood or bark submitted to examination.—_Ann. de Chimie_,\r\nxxxv., 166.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. _Pure Narcotine prepared_.—The following process is that\r\npractised by Mr. Carpenter. Digest one ounce of coarsely powdered\r\nopium in one pint of ether for ten days, frequently submitting it\r\nto ebullition in a water bath; separate the ether and add fresh\r\nportions until the opium is exhausted; place the ethereal solution in\r\na wide-mouthed bottle, and, covering the mouth with bibulous paper,\r\nallow the ether to evaporate spontaneously, but slowly; as the fluid\r\ndiminishes, it leaves the sides of the bottle coated with crystals\r\nof narcotine; as the solution becomes more dense, the crystals\r\nenlarge and accumulate, and the bottom of the vessel is covered with\r\nlarge transparent crystals, accompanied with a brown viscid liquor\r\nand extract, which contains an acid resin, caoutchouc, &c. Separate\r\nthese substances and wash the crystals in successive portions of cold\r\nether to remove the extract; then dissolve them in warm ether, and\r\nevaporate slowly as before; beautiful snow white crystals of pure\r\nnarcotine will be obtained: those on the sides of the vessel assume\r\nplumose and arborescent forms; they enlarge as the solution becomes\r\nmore concentrated, and the bottom of the bottle becomes covered with\r\npure narcotine, assuming the rhomboidal prismatic form with some\r\nmodifications of maccled crystals. The crystals towards the bottom\r\nare transparent, but the most minute at the top are opaque and snow\r\nwhite. By picking out the largest and most regular crystals, again\r\ndissolving and evaporating, and repeating the same process, each\r\ntime selecting the largest and best crystals, some were obtained the\r\neighth of an inch in diameter, and still larger might be produced by\r\nsimilar operations.—_Silliman’s Jour._, xiii. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. _Uncertain Nature of Jalapia_.—Relative to Mr. Hume’s supposed\r\nvegeto-alkali _Jalapia_, M. Pelletier says it is nothing more than\r\na mixture of sulphate of lime and sulphate of ammonia.—_Jour. de\r\nPharmacie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n32. _Preparation of pure Mellitic Acid, by_ M. Wöhler.—Concentrated\r\nsolution of carbonate of ammonia was poured upon finely pulverised\r\nmellite, and boiled until the excess of ammonia was [p484]\r\ndissipated; the solution was filtered and left to crystallize. The\r\npure crystals, being dissolved in water, were precipitated by acetate\r\nof lead, and the mellitate of lead, after being well washed was\r\ndecomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen; being filtered, the solution was\r\nevaporated to dryness, during which the mellitic acid precipitated\r\nas a white powder; being dissolved in cold alcohol, and left to\r\nevaporate spontaneously, the acid was obtained in acicular crystals.\r\nIn this state it is very acid, unaltered by air, very soluble in\r\nwater and alcohol, and sustains a considerable heat without change;\r\nit does not fuze, but ultimately sublimes, though probably not\r\nwithout decomposition. When boiled for a considerable time with\r\nalcohol, it undergoes a peculiar change, and occasions the production\r\nof a new acid substance, resembling the benzoic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n33. _On a New Acid existing in Iceland Moss_.—The reddish purple\r\ncolour which is produced by adding a decoction of Iceland moss to\r\nper-salts of iron, has been attributed to the presence of gallic\r\nacid, but is found by M. Pfaff to be occasioned by a new acid body\r\nwhich may be separated in the following manner. A pound of the\r\nlichen cut small is to be macerated in solution of carbonate of\r\npotassa, until all that is soluble is separated; the above quantity\r\nwill neutralize two gros[133] of the carbonate. The filtered\r\nliquor is to be precipitated by acetate of lead, and the brown\r\nprecipitate produced, when well washed, is to be diffused through\r\nwater, and sulphuretted hydrogen passed through it until all the\r\nlead is separated. The filtered liquor is acid, and by spontaneous\r\nevaporation, yields dendritic crystals. The crystals, when heated,\r\ncarbonize, but produce no odour like that of tartaric acid, and lime\r\nis left. If they be dissolved and acted upon by alkaline carbonates,\r\ncarbonate of lime is thrown down, and alkaline salts, containing the\r\nnew acid, are produced.\r\n\r\nThe potash salt crystallizes in quadrilateral prisms, needles\r\nor plates, and is not deliquescent. The soda salt has similar\r\ncharacters, and the ammonia salt crystallizes in needles. These salts\r\nabundantly precipitate the acetate and muriate of iron of a red brown\r\ncolour; they precipitate sulphate and nitrate of zinc white; muriate\r\nof manganese slightly of a clear brown colour; barytic and strontian\r\nsalts abundantly white; being mixed with strong solutions of muriate\r\nor acetate of lime, they gradually produce an acicular crystalline\r\nwhite precipitate; acetate of silver yields an abundant white\r\nprecipitate, which does not change colour in less than twenty-four\r\nhours: they do not precipitate salts of glucina, magnesia, alumine,\r\nuranium, nickel, copper, cobalt, gold or platina. This substance has\r\nbeen named the lichenic acid, and is distinguished from boletic acid\r\nby the different character of its vapour, and by forming an insoluble\r\nsalt with baryta.—_Bull.

Gautier’s Ferro-prussiate\r\n[p485] of Potash, as described in this Journal for_ July,\r\n1827.[134]—It is stated in the above article, “numerous\r\ninvestigations induced M. Gautier to conclude that when animal\r\nmatter is calcined alone, it yields but little cyanogen; that when\r\nmixed with potash it gives more; that the _substitution of nitre_\r\nfor potash, and the addition of iron or scales of iron, augmented\r\nthe production of cyanogen and gave a ferro-prussiate. The following\r\nis the process of manufacture to which M. Gautier has ultimately\r\narrived,” (for which see the Journal, 227.)\r\n\r\nM. Gautier giving the proportions of materials, directs—\r\n\r\n Blood in a dry state   3 parts\r\n Nitre                  1  \"\r\n Iron scales            1/50 of the blood employed.\r\n\r\nBlood not being at hand, animal muscular fibre was substituted,\r\nand the following results were obtained. I am not aware that the\r\ndried parts of animal muscular fibre are more inflammable than the\r\ncoagulated and dried parts of blood:—\r\n\r\n Muscular fibre  3 parts\r\n Nitre           1   \"\r\n Iron filings    1/50 of the undried muscle employed.\r\n\r\nThe muscular fibre, nitre and iron filings were beat into a mass, and\r\npartially dried by a moderate heat; they were then returned to the\r\nmortar and reduced to a perfectly homogeneous greyish white powder.\r\nThis was dried and weighed, and appeared to be reduced to nearly\r\nequal parts of nitrate of potash and animal fibre.\r\n\r\nThe desiccation having completed by a very moderate heat on a sand\r\nbath, will not, as far as I am aware, differ materially from that\r\nproduced by exposing the mass in “an airy situation to dry,” as\r\nnitrate of potash undergoes no decomposition by admixture with animal\r\nmatters at a low temperature.\r\n\r\nWhen the desiccation was completed, the mixture was charged into an\r\niron cylinder, placed in the sand-bath, and though combustion was\r\nnot anticipated in this part of the process, yet the mouth of the\r\ncylinder was turned towards the wall, lest an accident should occur,\r\n(which appeared to me to be more than probable in some stage of the\r\nprocess.) In about two hours after the cylinder had been heated, I\r\nwas surprised to see its contents ejected with considerable force,\r\nin a state of brilliant combustion. Supposing something in the above\r\nexperiment had been overlooked, and that, if the materials had\r\nbeen longer in contact previously to subjecting them to complete\r\ndesiccation, this inflammation would not have taken place, the\r\nexperiment was repeated with the following precautions: after the\r\nmuscular fibre had been subjected to the action of the pestle in\r\ncombination with the prescribed quantity of nitrate of potash, the\r\nmass was boiled with water for some hours, and then gently evaporated\r\nto dryness; even now, by applying a piece of red-hot charcoal, it was\r\nfound that the nitre was in a condition to enter [p486] into active\r\ncombustion, and if the cylinder had been again charged and subjected\r\nto a temperature capable of producing ignition, there cannot be a\r\ndoubt, but that a similar inflammation would have taken place.\r\n\r\nHowever this might be, this quantity of material was now mixed\r\nwith hydrate of potash to an equal weight with the nitre used; and\r\nthe mass subjected to the heat of a sand-bath for some hours, and\r\nafterwards submitted to the action of a naked fire for rather more\r\nthan an hour, and the heat brought up to redness. No considerable\r\naction took place, but some particles of the carbonaceous matter were\r\nejected, and produced brilliant scintillations in the fire, so that\r\nwe may conclude, notwithstanding the presence of so large a quantity\r\nof potash, the properties of the nitre were not destroyed.\r\n\r\n H.

NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n1. _Squalls of Wind on the African Shores_.—The following description\r\nis by D. M. Milnegraden, from the relations of his father. “The\r\napproach of the squall is generally foreboded by the appearance of\r\njet black clouds over the land, moving in a direction towards the\r\nsea, at the same time that a gentle breeze blows towards the shore.\r\nIn these circumstances, the precaution which my father usually\r\nadopted, was to take in immediately all sail, so as to leave the ship\r\nunder bare poles, and send the whole of the crew below decks. As the\r\ntornado approaches nearer, the rain is observed to be gushing down\r\nin torrents, and the lightning darting down from the clouds with\r\nsuch profusion, as to resemble continued showers of electric matter.\r\nWhen, however, the squall comes within the distance of about half a\r\nmile from the ship, these electric appearances altogether cease; the\r\nrain only continues in the same manner. As the tornado is passing\r\nover the ship, a loud crackling noise is distinctly heard among\r\nthe rigging, occasioned by the electric matter streaming down the\r\nmasts, whose points serve to attract it, and I think that I have been\r\ntold, that when this phenomenon takes place at night, a glimmering\r\nof light is observed over every part of the rigging. But when the\r\nsquall has removed to about half a mile beyond the ship, exactly\r\nthe same appearances return by which the squall was characterised\r\nin coming off the shore, and before reaching the same distance from\r\nthe ship. The lightning is again seen to be descending in continued\r\nsheets and in such abundance as even to resemble the torrents of rain\r\nthemselves which accompany the squall. These squalls take place every\r\nday during a certain season of the year called the Harmatan season.\r\nThe jet black clouds begin to appear moving from the mountains about\r\nnine in the morning, and reach the sea about two in the afternoon.\r\nAnother very singular fact attending these tornados is, that, after\r\nthey have moved out eight or nine leagues to sea, where [p487] they\r\nbecome apparently expended, the lightning is seen to rise up from the\r\nsea. The violence of the wind during the continuance of the storm is\r\nexcessive.”—_Jameson’s Journal_, 1823, p. 367.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Destruction of an Oak by Lightning_.—M. Muncke describes a case\r\nin which an oak, being struck by lightning, was rent and destroyed\r\nin an extraordinary manner. The trunk of the tree was about fifteen\r\nfeet in height, a foot and a half or two feet in diameter at the\r\nbranches, and three feet in diameter at the root. The top of the\r\ntree was separated as if by the stroke of a hatchet, and without\r\nany appearance of carbonization: the trunk was torn into a thousand\r\npieces, exceedingly small in size when compared with the original\r\nmass, and thrown to a great distance. The division and destruction\r\nwas such as to sustain the thought, that in certain cases the\r\nlightning might cause the entire dispersion of the tree, an opinion\r\nwhich was suggested by the circumstance that lightning which had\r\nfallen at Le Chateau de Marbourg left no traces of a rafter that had\r\noccurred in its course.—_Bull. Univ._ A. viii. 194.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Description of a Meteoric Fire-Ball seen at New Haven by the Rev.\r\nS. E. Dwight_.—The meteor appeared on Saturday evening, March 21,\r\n1813, a little before ten o’clock. The sky was much overcast, but\r\nthe covering thin, and the stars were in full view towards the north\r\nwhere the meteor appeared. Dr. Dwight was standing on a platform on\r\nthe north side of the house looking eastward, when the light first\r\nbroke upon him, and for a moment supposed it to be lightning, but was\r\ninstantly induced by its continuance to look at the luminary. The\r\nfollowing are the observations made at the time.\r\n\r\ni. The meteor was at first about 35° above the horizon, and, judging\r\nfrom the course of a fence near at hand, its direction about N. 20°.\r\nE.\r\n\r\nii. Its figure nearly that of an ellipse, with the ends in a slight\r\ndegree sharpened or angular.\r\n\r\niii. The length of its transverse diameter appeared to be about equal\r\nto the apparent diameter of the moon when on the meridian, and that\r\nof the conjugate about three fourths of the transverse.\r\n\r\niv. The colour rather more yellow than that of the moon.\r\n\r\nv. A tail of light, ten or twelve degrees in length, was formed\r\nbehind it; broadest near the body; decreasing in breadth very slowly\r\nfor about two-fifths of its length, after which it was uniform, and\r\nabout as wide as the apparent diameter of Venus. The direction of the\r\ntail was coincident with that of the transverse diameter.\r\n\r\nvi. The ball was far more luminous than the tail, and the part\r\nconnected with the tail scarcely less distinct than the opposite part.\r\n\r\nvii. The light was such that all objects cast distinct shadows,\r\nthough less strongly marked than when the moon is full.\r\n\r\nviii. Numerous sparks continually issued from the ball of the [p488]\r\nmeteor; they were of the apparent size, but much more brilliant\r\nthan the smaller stars, and after descending a little distance,\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nix. The meteor was visible for about eight or perhaps ten seconds.\r\n\r\nx. A second or two before its disappearance, three much larger\r\nsparks or luminous fragments were thrown off at once, two of them\r\nthe apparent size of Venus, the third larger. These were the last\r\npieces which were seen to leave the body. Their paths were at first\r\nnearly parallel with that of the meteor, yet beneath it. From this\r\ndirection, however, they all deviated constantly and rapidly, in\r\nparabolic curves, until they seemed falling perpendicularly towards\r\nthe earth. Each fragment became less and less distinct until it\r\ndisappeared. The largest continued visible until about 20° from the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nxi. The meteor itself disappeared as suddenly as if, in one\r\nindivisible moment, it had passed into a medium absolutely opaque,\r\nor as if, at a given moment, it had left the atmosphere; but a few\r\nmoments afterwards there was a distinct and somewhat extensive\r\nillumination over that part of the sky for about a second.\r\n\r\nxii. When the meteor disappeared, it was about 30° above the horizon\r\nin the direction of N. 45° E. or 25° east of the place where it was\r\nfirst seen. The direction of the path was probably from W. by S. to\r\nE. by N. The meteor was obviously going from the observer, its path\r\nmaking an angle with the optic axis of about 60°.\r\n\r\nxiii. Between eight and ten minutes after the disappearance of the\r\nmeteor, there was a loud and heavy report, accompanied by a very\r\nsensible jar; it did not much resemble either thunder or the report\r\nof a cannon, but was louder, shorter, and sharper than either, and\r\nwas followed by no perceptible echo.\r\n\r\nxiv. A friend of Dr. Dwight’s, who was in Berlin at the time, about\r\ntwenty-three miles due N. of Newhaven, saw the meteor distinctly, but\r\nmade no particular observations. His account accorded generally with\r\nthat given; but the meteor appeared to him larger, more elevated, and\r\nsomewhat more to the east in its apparent place. No account could\r\nbe obtained of any fragments which had fallen from it.—_Silliman’s\r\nJournal_, xiii. 35.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Remarkable Meteoric Phenomenon, described by_ Chladni.—A noise,\r\nresembling thunder in its rolling nature, was heard at Saarbruck\r\nand the environs, about four o’clock on the 1st of April, 1826, the\r\natmosphere being clear, and the sun shining brightly. During the\r\nsound, a greyish object, apparently about three feet and a half in\r\nheight, was seen in the air, rapidly approaching the earth, and there\r\nexpanding itself like a sheet; there was then silence for about a\r\nminute, after which another sound, resembling thunder, was heard, as\r\nif it had originated at the place where the meteor fell. Nothing was\r\nfound when the place was afterwards examined.—_Bull. Univ._ A. viii.\r\n143. [p489]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Aurora Borealis seen in the Day-time at Canonmills_.—The morning\r\nof Sunday, September 9th, was rainy, with a light gale from the N.E.\r\nBefore mid-day the wind began to veer to the west, and the clouds\r\nin the north-western horizon cleared away: the blue sky in that\r\nquarter assumed the form of the segment of a very large circle,\r\nwith a well-defined line, the clouds above continuing dense, and\r\ncovering the rest of the heavens. The centre of the azure arch\r\ngradually inclined more to the north, and reached an elevation of\r\nnearly 20°. In a short time very thin fleecy clouds began to rise\r\nfrom the horizon within the blue arch; and through these very faint\r\nperpendicular streaks, of a sort of milky light, could be perceived\r\nshooting; the eye being thus guided, could likewise detect the same\r\npale streaks passing over the intense azure arch, but they were\r\nextremely slight and evanescent. Between nine and ten in the evening\r\nof the same day, the aurora borealis was very brilliant: so that\r\nthere is no reason to doubt that the azure arch in the morning, and\r\nthe pale light seen shooting across it, were connected with the same\r\nphenomenon.—_Jameson’s Jour._ 1827, p. 378.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Aurora Borealis in Siberia_.—Baron Wrangle says, that in Siberia,\r\nwhen shooting stars pass across the space occupied by polar lights,\r\nfiery beams suddenly arise in the place traversed by the shooting\r\nstar: further, that when a polar beam rises high towards the zenith,\r\nthe full moon also being high, it gradually forms a luminous circle\r\naround the moon, at a distance of 20° or 30° from her, remains in\r\nthis form for a short time, and then disappears.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _On the Presence of Ammonia in Argillaceous Minerals_.—Being\r\nengaged in the examination of different specimens of gypsum, M. Bouis\r\nobserved, that traces of ammonia were evident in one containing\r\nmuch argillaceous matter. The peculiar odour common to argillaceous\r\nminerals when breathed upon, was very striking in this specimen of\r\ngypsum; when a portion of it was moistened with solution of potash,\r\nand muriatic acid brought near, white vapours were produced, and\r\nreddened litmus paper was very quickly rendered of a blue colour in\r\nits vicinity.\r\n\r\nIt was now suspected that all mineral substances, emitting an\r\nargillaceous odour, contained ammonia; a great number of specimens\r\nwere tried, being moistened with solution of caustic potash, and\r\nexamined by litmus paper. In no case was ammonia absent, and with\r\ncommon clay it continued to be evolved for more than two days.\r\nAmongst the substances tried, were pipe clay, other clays, numerous\r\ngypsums, Paris plaster, steatite, &c. The antiquity of the mineral\r\nseemed to have no relation to the ammonia.\r\n\r\nM. Bouis concludes that, in all cases, the argillaceous smell\r\nof minerals is connected with, and dependent upon, the presence\r\nof ammonia, the latter being the vehicle of this particular\r\nodour.—_Annales de Chimie_, xxxv. 333.

Some of the wells are from thirty-seven to\r\nfifty-three fathoms in depth, and are said to yield at an average,\r\ndaily, from 130 to 185 gallons of the earth-oil. The wells are\r\nscattered over an area of about sixteen square miles. The wells are\r\nprivate property, the owners paying a tax of five per cent. of the\r\nproduce to the state. This commodity is almost universally used\r\nby the Burmans as lamp oil. Its price on the spot does not, on an\r\naverage, exceed from fivepence to sevenpence halfpenny per cwt. The\r\nother useful mineral or saline productions of the Burman empire are\r\ncoal, saltpetre, soda, and culinary salt.

In that time the leaves of all the forests which are seen from\r\nthis place have greatly expanded. But they were all of a pallid hue\r\nuntil this afternoon. Within the period of about six hours, they have\r\nall changed their colour to a beautiful green. As the only efficient\r\nchange which has taken place, is that we have a [p491] serene sky,\r\nand a bright sun, we may say with confidence that this change of\r\ncolour is produced by the action of the sun’s rays.”\r\n\r\n“Seven years ago, next month, I had a still more favourable\r\nopportunity to observe this phenomenon in company with the Hon. J.\r\nLansing, late Chancellor of this State. While we were engaged in\r\ntaking a geological survey of his manor of Blenheim, the leaves of\r\nthe forest had expanded to almost the common size in cloudy weather.\r\nI believe the sun had scarcely shone upon them in twenty days.\r\nStanding upon a hill, we observed that the dense forests upon the\r\nopposite side of the Schoharie were almost white. The sun now began\r\nto shine in full brightness. The colour of the forest absolutely\r\nchanged so fast that we could perceive its progress. By the middle of\r\nthe afternoon, the whole of these extensive forests, many miles in\r\nlength, presented their usual summer dress.”—_Silliman’s Journal_,\r\nxiii. 193.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Organization and Reproduction of the Trufle_.—The trufle,\r\naccording to the account given of it by M. Turpin, in a memoir read\r\nto the Academy of Sciences, is a vegetable entirely destitute of\r\nleafy appendages or of roots; it is nothing more than a rounded\r\nsubterraneous mass, absorbing nourishment upon every point of its\r\nsurface, and the reproduction of which is dependent upon bodies\r\ngenerated within its substance. The trufle is composed of, i.\r\nglobular vesicles, destined, to the reproduction of the vegetable;\r\nii. short and barren filaments, called by M. Turpin, _tigellules_.\r\nThe whole forms a substance, at first white, but which becomes brown\r\nby age, with the exception of particular white veins. This change of\r\ncolour is dependent upon the presence of the reproductive bodies or\r\n_trufinelles_. Each globular vesicle is fitted to give birth, on its\r\ninternal surface, to a multitude of these reproductive bodies, but\r\nthere are only a few of them which perfect the young vegetable. These\r\ndilate considerably, and produce internally other smaller vesicles,\r\nof which, two, three, or four increase in size, become brown, are\r\nbeset with small points on their exterior surface, and fill the\r\ninterior of the larger vesicle. The small masses thus formed, are the\r\n_trufinelles_, and become trufles after the death of their parent.\r\nThus the brown parts of the trufle are those which contain the\r\ntrufinelles, and the interposed white veins are the parts which are\r\ndestitute of trufinelles. The parent trufle, having accomplished its\r\ngrowth and the formation of the reproductive bodies within, gradually\r\ndissolves and supplies that aliment to the young vegetable which is\r\nproper for them; the cavity originally occupied by it in the earth\r\nis then left occupied by a multitude of young trufles, of which the\r\nstronger starve or destroy the others, whilst they frequently adhere\r\ntogether, and, enlarging in size, reproduce the phenomena already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe reporters of this memoir to the Academy state that they have\r\nverified M. Turpin’s account, but point out a circumstance in the\r\nnatural history of the trufle, which is still unexplained. If the\r\n[p492] method described be the only mode in which the trufle\r\nis reproduced, then it is difficult to comprehend the enormous\r\nmultiplication of that vegetable in certain parts of France, where\r\nimmense quantities are annually collected without exhausting or even\r\ndiminishing the race. If the plant has no means of progression, how\r\ncan the young trufles leave the place of their birth, and become\r\ndisseminated over the soil? The Mémoire received the approbation of\r\nthe Academy.—_Revue Ency._ xxxv. 794.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Alteration of Corn in a subterraneous Repository_.—An inhabitant\r\nof Deneuvre in the department of Merthe, whilst excavating in the\r\nlocality of the ancient citadel of that town, found a large quantity\r\nof corn which appeared to have been carbonized. A portion was sent\r\nto M. Braconnot for examination, but without any particulars of the\r\ncavity containing it. The grain was smooth on the exterior, and\r\nunchanged in form, but its aspect announced the entire destruction\r\nof its proximate principles. It floated on water, could be crushed\r\nbetween the finger to a black powder, and when rubbed on paper left\r\ntraces resembling those of black chalk.\r\n\r\nBeing analysed, it was found to consist principally of a substance\r\nresembling ulmine in its properties, ulmate of lime and carbonaceous\r\nmatter: the proportions were\r\n\r\n Ulmine                                                26.5\r\n Ulmate of lime, containing some phosphate of lime\r\n   and a little oxide of iron                          42.0\r\n Carbonaceous matter                                   30.0\r\n Muriates of potash and lime                            1.5\r\n Nitrates of potash and lime                            1.5\r\n Fatty matter of the consistency of wax, undetermined.\r\n                                                      -----\r\n                                                      100.0\r\n\r\nAlthough the time during which this corn has been stored up is\r\nprobably very long, still M. Braconnot thinks the principal cause of\r\nthe change in it has been humidity; and thinks also that the same\r\nmay have been the case with the corn lately found in an Egyptian\r\ntomb[135], and quotes the known fact of corn having been found at\r\nScarpone, an ancient Roman station, preserved in good condition,\r\nduring eighteen centuries, in a reservoir constructed of Roman mortar.\r\n\r\nThe best use that could be made of the carbonized corn of Deneuvre\r\nwas to apply it as a manure, for it contained the best elements of\r\na substance of this kind, and M. Braconnot had long since observed\r\nthe presence of ulmine in good manure, its acid properties, and its\r\neffects on vegetation. He adds also that Bruyères earth of excellent\r\nquality gave one-fourth of a combustible matter formed of ulmine\r\nand a carbonaceous body but little soluble in potash, the remaining\r\nthree-fourths being a pure siliceous sand without a trace of lime.\r\nYet so effectual is this earth, that, where it cannot be obtained,\r\ncertain exotics cannot be cultivated.—_Annales de Chimie_, xxxv. 262.\r\n[p493]\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n [135] See p. 210 of the last Number.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _Quick Method of putting Insects to Death_.—The following method\r\nis by M. Ricord, for the use of naturalists. The insect is to be\r\nfixed on a piece of cork and put under a jar or vessel with a little\r\nether; the latter being placed either in a capsule, or on the plate\r\non which the jar or glass is placed: the vessel should apply closely,\r\nthat the vapour of the ether may be retained, and the air within be\r\nprevented from changing its place. The insect thus immersed in the\r\nethereal atmosphere will soon die without having time to hurt its\r\nform or appearance by violence.—_Bull. Univ._ B. xii. 295.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _Destruction of Snails by common Salt_.—M. Em. Rousseau had\r\napplied common salt as a manure to a small piece of garden, and\r\nremarked that where snails had come in contact with the salt they\r\nquickly died. Wishing to confirm the fact, he strewed some salt upon\r\nthe ground and placed a number of snails amongst it; all those which\r\ncame out of their shells and touched the salt immediately threw out a\r\ngreenish globular froth, and in a few minutes were dead. The fact may\r\nbe turned to account by agriculturists and gardeners.—_Bull. Univ._\r\nD. viii. 276.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. _Remarkable Hairy Man_.—The following account is given of an\r\nindividual of this kind in Crawford’s Mission to Ava. “As connected\r\nwith this department may be mentioned the existence at Ava of a\r\nman covered from head to foot with hair, whose history is not less\r\nremarkable than that of the celebrated porcupine man who excited so\r\nmuch curiosity in England and other parts of Europe near a century\r\nago. The hair on the face of this singular being, the ears included,\r\nis shaggy, and about eight inches long. On the breast and shoulders\r\nit is from four to five. It is singular that the teeth of this\r\nindividual are defective in number, the molares or grinders being\r\nentirely wanting. This person is a native of the Shan country, or\r\nLao, and from the banks of the upper portion of the Saluen, or\r\nMartaban river; he was presented to the king of Ava as a curiosity,\r\nby the prince of that country. At Ava he married a Burmese woman,\r\nby whom he has two daughters; the eldest resembles her mother, the\r\nyoungest is covered with hair like her father, only that it is white\r\nor fair, whereas his is now brown or black, having, however, been\r\nfair when a child, like that of the infant. With the exceptions\r\nmentioned, both the father and his child are perfectly well-formed,\r\nand, indeed, for the Burman race, rather handsome. The whole family\r\nwere sent by the king to the residence of the Mission, where drawings\r\nand descriptions of them were taken.”—_Jameson’s Jour._ 1827, p. 368.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. _Application of Remedies by Absorption from the Surface_.—The\r\nfollowing are the results obtained by M. Bailly, who has been\r\nassiduously engaged in trying this plan.\r\n\r\n_Salts of Morphia_, applied in this manner, speedily exhibit their\r\n[p494] action upon the brain and nervous system, by the contraction\r\nof the pupils, and often by dysuria and ischuria; nausea and vomiting\r\nare rare; sometimes a sensation of itching is felt in the nasal\r\ncavities, and papular eruptions not unfrequently appear upon the skin.\r\n\r\n_Extract of Belladonna_, applied upon the upper surface of the feet,\r\nproduced all the consequences derived from its internal exhibition;\r\nsuch as dilatation of the pupil and impaired vision.\r\n\r\n_Extract of Squill_, while it augments transpiration, promotes the\r\nurinary secretion, and facilitates expectoration.\r\n\r\n_Well powdered Strychnine_ supports the suppuration of wounds\r\ntolerably well, and stimulates the locomotive system without\r\ninconveniently exciting the brain. It happens also in certain\r\npalsies, such as those which are caused by the carbonate of lead,\r\nthat the power of motion is restored without the production of those\r\nviolent shocks which have been so unpleasant to patients. M. Bailly\r\nhas observed, with respect to this medicine in general, that it often\r\nexcites a marked turgescence about the head, heightening the colour\r\nof the face, which demands the suspension of the remedy, if not the\r\nintervention of blood-letting.\r\n\r\n_Perchloride of Mercury_ (corrosive sublimate) produces an intense\r\nsensation of heat, and corrodes the parts with which it comes in\r\ncontact. Sometimes, however, it has been known to relieve the pains\r\nof exostoses, &c. _The proto-chloride_ (calomel) also excites pain,\r\nparticularly if rubbed upon a recently blistered surface. In this way\r\nit may cure old syphilitic affections; but as a set-off against these\r\nadvantages, there is sometimes a difficulty in keeping up the action,\r\nas the absorbent powers of the surface wear out by long continued\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of the _endermic_ practice is the exemption of\r\nthe digestive organs from an inconvenient or unaccustomed stimulus;\r\nand its importance must be apparent where the stomach is incapable of\r\nretaining medicines, or the power of deglutition is lost.—_Nouv. Bib.\r\nMed._—_Med. Rep._ v. 341.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. _On the Strix Cunicularia, or Coquimbo Owl_.—Captain Head, and\r\nevery reader of his “Rough Notes,” will, we are sure thank us for\r\nany hint tending to throw light on facts related in that spirited\r\nand interesting narrative; particularly as, in the course of his\r\nadventures, circumstances are occasionally recorded somewhat\r\nstartling to those who are in the habit of considering whatever\r\nsurpasses their ken or comprehension as a travellers’ tale. Thus the\r\nconcluding part of the following passage, however true to the very\r\nletter, as we shall show, has we know excited considerable surprise,\r\nand possibly considerable doubt as to its accuracy.\r\n\r\n“The Biscacho[136] is found all over the plains of the Pampas;\r\nlike rabbits they live in holes, which are in groups in every\r\n[p495] direction, and which make galloping over these plains very\r\ndangerous. These animals are never seen in the day, but as soon as\r\nthe lower limb of the sun reaches the horizon, they are seen issuing\r\nfrom their holes in all directions, which are scattered in groups\r\nlike little villages, all over the Pampas. The biscachos, when full\r\ngrown, are nearly as large as badgers, but their head resembles a\r\nrabbit, excepting that they have large bushy whiskers. In the evening\r\nthey sit outside their holes, and they all appear to be moralising.\r\nThey are the most serious looking animals I ever saw; and even the\r\nyoung ones are grey headed, have mustachios, and look thoughtful and\r\ngrave. _In the day time their holes are always guarded by two little\r\nowls, who are never an instant away from their post. As one gallops\r\nby these owls, they always stand looking at the stranger and then at\r\neach other, moving their old-fashioned heads in a manner which is\r\nquite ridiculous, until one rushes by them, when fear gets the better\r\nof their dignified looks, and they both run into the biscachos’\r\n“hole_.”—(Head’s Rough Notes, p. 82.)\r\n\r\nCaptain Head has not given us the name of this owl, but in all\r\nprobability it was the Strix Cunicularia, or Coquimbo Owl, which is\r\ndescribed as flying _in pairs_, sometimes by day, and making its nest\r\n_in long subterraneous burrows_[137]. In the singular motion of its\r\nhead, it however corresponds with the Strix Brasiliana, or Brownish\r\nHorned Owl, mentioned by Maregrave in his History of Brazil, which he\r\nsays is easily tamed, and can so _turn about its neck_ that the tip\r\nof the beak shall exactly point at the middle of the back; that it\r\nalso plays with men like an ape, _making many mowes_, (as Willoughby\r\ntranslates it,) _and antic mimical faces_, and snapping with its\r\nbill. But for the best account we have met with, we are indebted to\r\nthe splendid continuation of Wilson’s American Ornithology by Lucien\r\nBonaparte, under the title “Burrowing Owl—a bird,” he says, “that so\r\nfar from seeking refuge in the ruined habitations of man, fixes his\r\nresidence within the earth; instead of concealing itself in solitary\r\nrecesses of the forests, delights to dwell on open plains, in company\r\nwith animals remarkable for their social disposition, neatness, and\r\norder. Instead of sailing heavily forth in the obscurity of the\r\nevening or morning twilight, and then retreating to its secluded\r\nabode, this bird enjoys the broadest glare of the noon-day sun,\r\nand flying rapidly along, searches for food or pleasure during the\r\ncheerful light of the day. In the trans-Mississippian territories\r\nof the United States, this very singular bird _resides exclusively\r\nin the villages of the Marmot, or Prairie Dog_, whose excavations\r\nare so commodious, as to render it unnecessary that it should dig\r\nfor itself, as it is said to do in other parts of the world, where\r\nno burrowing animals exist. These villages are very numerous, and\r\nvariable in their extent, sometimes covering only a few acres, and at\r\nothers spreading over the surface of the country for miles together.\r\nThey are composed of slightly [p496] elevated mounds, about two\r\nfeet in width at the base, and seldom exceeding eighteen inches in\r\nheight. In all these Prairie dog villages, the burrowing owl is seen\r\nmoving briskly about, or else in small flocks scattered among the\r\nmounds, and at a distance it may be mistaken for the marmot itself\r\nwhen sitting erect. They manifest _but little timidity, and allow\r\nthemselves to be approached sufficiently close for shooting_; but if\r\nalarmed, some or all of them soar away, and settle down again at a\r\nshort distance: if further disturbed, their flight is continued until\r\nthey are no longer in view, _or they descend into their dwellings,\r\nwhence they are difficult to dislodge_. The burrows into which these\r\nowls have been seen to descend on the plains of the river Platte,\r\nwhere they are the most numerous, were evidently excavated by the\r\nmarmot, whence it has been interred by the learned and indefatigable\r\nSay[138], that they were either common, though unfriendly residents\r\nof the same habitation, or that the owl was the sole occupant by\r\nright of conquest.” We have in the statements of Captain Head,\r\nhowever, a proof that both tenants habitually resort at the same time\r\nto one burrow; and we are assured by Pike and others, that a common\r\ndanger often drives them into the same excavation where lizards and\r\nrattlesnakes also enter for concealment and safety.\r\n\r\nIn the above extracts we have noted in italics the striking\r\nsimilarity to the account given by Captain Head.\r\n\r\n E. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [136] This animal is probably either the Cavia Paca, Spotted Cavy,\r\n or Arctomys Monax, Ferruginous Brown Marmot, though the latter is\r\n described as principally found in North America.\r\n\r\n [137] Turton, Lin. vol. i. 169.\r\n\r\n [138] We have had no opportunity of consulting Say, and therefore\r\n can only refer our readers to an author who has collected an\r\n interesting store of facts relative to natural science, and\r\n particularly with regard to this bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. _Naturalisation of Fish_.—We have received the following from Mr.\r\nArnold of Guernsey.\r\n\r\n Sir,                                    16th _August_, 1827.\r\n\r\nHaving understood that the correctness of Dr. Mac Culloch’s\r\nstatements respecting my pond, and the attempts to propagate sea fish\r\nin it, have been questioned, I beg to say that his statements are\r\nperfectly correct; and to add further, that during nearly four months\r\nof the year the water is perfectly fresh, and is drunk by cattle.\r\n\r\nIn summer, the saltness varies; but no examination yet made has\r\ndiscovered in it more than half as much salt as is contained in the\r\nneighbouring sea-water.\r\n\r\nI further beg leave to add, that the general size of the pond in\r\nsummer is about four acres and a half; in winter, when swelled by the\r\nrains, it is extended to upwards of fifteen acres; which will account\r\nfor the freshness of the water.\r\n\r\n                       I remain, Sir, your obedient humble servant,\r\n _To the Editor of the Quarterly Journal_.

If\r\nthe American apples were packed among grain, they would arrive here\r\nin much finer condition. In Portugal it is customary to have a small\r\nledge in every apartment, (immediately under the cornice,) barely\r\nwide enough to hold an apple: in this way the ceilings are fringed\r\nwith fruit, which are not easily got at without a ladder; while\r\none glance of the eye serves to shew if any depredations have been\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. _On the Cultivation and Forcing Sea Kale_.—The Crambe maritima,\r\nor Sea Kale, is an indigenous plant of this and other countries of\r\nEurope, and found on the sandy beach of the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nIt has been long introduced into our gardens as a culinary vegetable,\r\nbut it is only within the last thirty years, that it has been brought\r\ninto general use, and subjected to a mode of cultivation, very\r\ndifferent from that which was first bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\nThe principal value of this plant is its property of early growth;\r\nappearing at table at a time when few such things can be had. It\r\nprecedes asparagus, for which it is no bad substitute; and as it\r\nmakes a dish of itself, it gives a variety to the delicacies of the\r\ntable; and if the opinions given of its medicinal virtues be correct,\r\nit is well worth cultivation, and the notice we are about to take of\r\nit, in describing an easy method of having it in great perfection\r\nthroughout the winter months, and up to the time it may be gathered\r\nfrom the natural ground.\r\n\r\nPrepare one or more beds (with alleys two feet wide between) for the\r\nreception of the seeds, in the following manner: mark out the bed or\r\nbeds two and a half feet wide, and of any required length, as near\r\nas can be from east to west; line off the sides and ends, driving a\r\nstake at each corner to ascertain the boundaries; dig out the earth\r\nof the bed one spade deep, removing it to some distance; fill this\r\nexcavation with the purest and finest sand which can be procured in\r\nthe neighbourhood, either from the sea-shore, the bed of a river, or\r\nfrom a pit. It signifies nothing of what colour it is, so it be pure,\r\nand as free from loam as it can be had; for in proportion as the soil\r\nof the bed is poor or rich, so will the flavour of the plant be when\r\ndressed. When this precaution is not taken, and when the plants are\r\nsuffered to enjoy the rich and cultivated soil of a kitchen garden,\r\nor the situation made so, by rich dressings or coverings of fresh\r\nmanure, the plants are stimulated into an unnatural luxuriance, which\r\ndeteriorates the flavour, imparting to them that strong disagreeable\r\nscent and taste, resembling common cabbage, than which nothing can\r\nbe a greater drawback on the value of the vegetable; but when grown\r\nentirely in pure sand, the flavour is mild and pleasant, and is\r\nrelished by most palates.\r\n\r\nWhen the bed is filled with sand and raised therewith about six\r\ninches above the natural level of the ground, (and this should be\r\ndone previous to the end of March, which is the sowing season,) draw\r\na drill along the middle, from end to end, about three inches [p498]\r\ndeep, in which drop the seeds pretty thickly, as they can be thinned\r\nout to the proper distance after they come up. If the sand or weather\r\nbe dry at the time of sowing, give a little water in the drill and\r\nimmediately cover up. If the seed be good, the plants will soon\r\nappear, and when they are advanced to a size large enough to enable\r\nthe gardener to choose the most promising, let them be thinned out\r\nto the distance of six or seven inches, the distance at which they\r\nmay remain. During the summer, the bed should be occasionally watered\r\nwith _dung water_; and this for the purpose of encouraging the growth\r\nof the plants on their first setting off; and as manure given in\r\nthis shape is more fugitive than when applied in a more solid or\r\nconcentrated state, it cannot impart rankness to the plants when they\r\narrive at that age fit to be brought to table.\r\n\r\nThe plants cannot be forced, nor should any of their shoots be cut,\r\nthe first winter after sowing; but should be suffered and assisted to\r\nestablish themselves, and gain sufficient strength to yield adequate\r\ncrops, in the succeeding years.\r\n\r\nAbout the month of November in the second winter after sowing, a\r\npart at one end of the bed should be prepared for forcing. For this\r\npurpose, and in order that it may be done with facility and effect,\r\na rough wooden frame or frames should be made, eighteen inches high\r\nbehind, and one foot high in front, shaped like a common hot-bed\r\nframe, and of any convenient and portable length; and in width, the\r\nsame as the bed. Light wooden covers in convenient lengths should\r\nbe fixed by hinges to the back; these may be raised at will for\r\nadmission of light and air, and, in fine weather, may be thrown\r\nentirely back. When the frames are placed, dig out the alleys one\r\nfoot deep to receive linings of hot dung, which may be banked op\r\nagainst both the back and front of the frame. The surface of the bed\r\nwithin the frame must be covered with soft, short straw, or hay, nine\r\ninches thick, to arrest the heat which rises from the linings, and\r\nform that warm humid region into which the shoots will advance. The\r\ntemperature of these dark frames must be regulated by due attendance;\r\nand in intensely cold or frosty weather, the frames at night will\r\nrequire coverings of mats and litter, to prevent the plants receiving\r\na check.\r\n\r\nThe required supply of the family—the time for it—and the length or\r\nnumber of the frames, must be judged of by the gardener, and who will\r\nact accordingly; but two frames are indispensable; because the second\r\nshould be considerably advanced by the time the crop in the first is\r\nall cut.\r\n\r\nYoung plants may be transplanted; and if they are to be had, may\r\nbe tried; but the safer way is to sow and plant both, to prevent\r\ndisappointment; and in order that the roots be not too much exhausted\r\nby forcing, one bed should be forced in one year, and another the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThe crowns of the roots have a tendency to rise; and as annual [p499]\r\nadditions of sand will be required after the autumnal dressing, the\r\nbeds by these additions become unsightly; but cutting off the most\r\naspiring (with its flowering stem) every summer, will keep the whole\r\nwithin proper bounds. Instead of covering with dung or litter, to\r\nprotect from winter’s frost, the frames may be set on those parts\r\nintended to be forced, to answer that purpose; and the uncovered\r\nparts of the beds may receive a coat of mould out of the alleys, to\r\nbe drawn back off the sand in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this began to force Sea Kale as long ago as 1798, using\r\nhot dung within, as well as without, a frame with glazed lights; but\r\nsoon found that, neither the glass nor dung _inside_ was necessary or\r\nsuitable; he, therefore, afterwards succeeded, by the above plan, to\r\nproduce the finest crops of this vegetable, at any time in the winter\r\nmonths; and can confidently recommend such management, especially to\r\nthose who have no hot-house or hot-bed frames; because when there is\r\nany early forced house or frames, if old roots are properly selected\r\nand potted in the autumn, and placed in such house or frame, where\r\nthere is sufficient heat, and well shut up from light by whelming\r\nother empty pots over them, a crop may be had in this way, without\r\nthe trouble and expense of out-door forcing.\r\n\r\n J.

Illustrations are moved from inside\r\nparagraphs to between paragraphs. Footnotes are moved from the\r\nbottoms of pages to the ends of the relevant articles. There are\r\nuncommon Unicode characters, e.g. on page 451; these are rendered\r\nas images in the html and mobile versions.\r\n\r\nOriginal printed page numbers are shown like \"[p052]\". Original small\r\ncaps LOOKS LIKE THIS. Italics look _like this_. Ditto marks are\r\nsometimes deleted, and replaced with repeated text if necessary.\r\n\r\nLarge curly brackets, \"{\" or \"}\", used to indicate combination or\r\ngrouping of information on two or more lines, have been eliminated\r\nfrom this ebook. In some cases, the large brackets have been replaced\r\nby \"{\" or \"}\" on multiple lines. Otherwise the information has been\r\nrecast if necessary, preferring minimal changes, to retain the\r\noriginal meaning.\r\n\r\nThe original Journal of July–December, 1827 was evidently printed in\r\ntwo parts, at different times. The title page of the first part (page\r\n1) was printed with a footer \"JULY–OCT. 1827.\". The title page of the\r\nsecond part (page 237) contained a similar footer \"OCT.–DEC. 1827.\".\r\nThe text of these footers have been moved into the titles on the same\r\npages.\r\n\r\nThe Table of Contents for the first part was labeled \"_Jul.–Oct._\r\n1827\" The Table of Contents for the second part was not similarly\r\nlabeled, but the transcriber has inserted a label \"_Oct.–Dec._ 1827\".\r\nThe separate Tables of Contents have been placed together at the\r\nbeginning of this edition. The section titled \"Proceedings of\r\nthe Horticultural Society.\" that starts on page 190 originally had no\r\nentry in the Table of Contents; such an entry has been inserted. The\r\noriginal Table of Contents for part one did not include a reference\r\nto the Meteorological Diary for Jun–Aug; such a reference has been\r\ninserted. The two Meteorological Diaries were originally printed as\r\nthree-month tables, approximately 7.4 inches wide by 3.9 inches,\r\nturned 90°, using 6.5 point type. These tables have been divided into\r\nthree tables each—one for each month.\r\n\r\nPage 31: In the phrase \"ratio of which to the breadth has been\r\naugmented by them from about 3-1/4.1, to 4.1\", the phrase \"3-1/4.1\"\r\napparently denotes a ratio of 3.25:1, and \"4.1\" must mean a ratio 4:1.\r\n\r\nPages 136 and 137: The characters, such as M′, S′, M, S, etc.\r\ndenoting mathematical variables were originally printed in italics.\r\nThis notation has been discarded on these pages.\r\n\r\nPage 194: In the text following 'M. Hachette says, “The air',\r\nthere was no closing quotation mark. Three quotation marks have\r\nbeen inserted, to close the paragraph, and to enclose the apparent\r\nquotation in the paragraph below.\r\n\r\nPage 223: There is an equation that originally ended\r\n\"sin. [(_n_−1) 30° + 124° 8′)]\". The last right parenthesis is not\r\nbalanced, and has been removed.\r\n\r\nPage 227: There was no closing quotation mark for the quotation begun\r\non the previous page; such a mark has been added at the end of the\r\nfirst paragraph.\r\n\r\nPage 253: \"sufficient far\" was changed to \"sufficient for\".\r\n\r\nPage 277: \"Chemical apparhtus\" was changed to \"Chemical apparatus\".\r\n\r\nPage 288: \"rea advantages\" was changed to \"real advantages\".\r\n\r\nPage 313: The quotation mark immediately following 'It begins\r\nimmediately with' has no closing quote. This structure has been\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nPage 315: \"children, for ever. 28\" was changed to \"children, for\r\never. (28)\".\r\n\r\nPage 376: In \"bring the scale L to cnt it\", \"cnt\" was changed to\r\n\"cut\".\r\n\r\nPage 425: \"council,) the chair\" was changed to \"council, (the chair\".\r\n\r\nPage 428: in the table of Elements, the two \"}\" replace one big \"}\",\r\nmeant to suggest that the text \"Mean Equinox 1829 Jan.9.72\" goes with\r\nboth lines.\r\n\r\nPage 451: The large table (originally 7.0 inches wide by 3.8 inches,\r\nturned 90°, printed in 9 point type) was divided into two parts,\r\nretaining the first column in both parts. The table on page 452 was\r\nrestructured to three columns instead of six.\r\n\r\nPage 455: For the quotation begun 'Bailey of Boston, says, “I\r\nunderstand', a closing quotation mark has been inserted at the end of\r\nthe paragraph.\r\n\r\nPage 459: \"74° − 32° = 42° .00305 × 42\" was changed to \"74° − 32° =\r\n42°; .00305 × 42\". And \"and 30.597 + 052 = 30.649\" was changed to\r\n\"and 30.597 + .052 = 30.649\".\r\n\r\nPage 463: In \"The effects are produced either with or without access\r\nto air\", \"to\" was illegible, and has been inserted.\r\n\r\nPage 479: The larger table (\"Crucibles, &c.\") has been divided into\r\ntwo tables.\r\n\r\nPage 491: The quotation beginning 'Troy, April 30, 1827. “Clouds\r\nand rain' had no close quote. New quotation marks were inserted at\r\nthe end of that paragraph, and around the apparent quotation in the\r\nfollowing paragraph.\r\n\r\nScans of the original printed book are available from\r\narchive.org/details/quarterlyjournal37roya. Based on the stated\r\nscanning rate of the Internet Archive copy, the Journal page size was\r\nabout 4.3 inches wide by 7.8 inches high. The first paragraph of the\r\nfirst article on Page 1, \"On the Beauties . . .\", which is typical of\r\nan html h2 level article, was printed in a column 3.7 inches wide,\r\nusing type with height 11 points, with 2 points leading between\r\nlines. The heading \"III. Natural History\" on page 486 is a typical\r\nhtml h3 level heading. It was printed in 9 point small caps type.\r\nThe paragraph below it, a typical h4 level article, was printed in 9\r\npoint type, with no leading.",
